林主席（香港旅遊發展局主席林建岳）、劉局長（深圳市文化廣電旅遊體育局局長劉蕾）、各位嘉賓、各位同學和傳媒朋友：

大家好。

今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，香港特區政府團結各界舉辦了一系列的大型紀念活動，讓全港市民包括我們的年輕一代以及來自不同地方的旅客，通過這些紀念活動，認識中國人民在爭取和平進程中所展現的團結和堅韌精神，增強家國情懷。

為加深市民和旅客對香港抗戰歷史的認識，行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》提出會推廣以「中國文化名人大營救」歷史為主題的紅色體驗研學新路線。今日由香港旅遊發展局及深圳市文化廣電旅遊體育局合辦的「中國文化名人大營救」香港深圳學習之旅，有來自四間學校，共一百多名的香港和深圳學生參與，亦標誌着這條研學路線的正式啓動。

這場被茅盾先生譽為「抗戰以來最偉大的搶救工作」，自一九四二年元旦開始，歷經六個多月的時間，先後營救了共800多名人士。行動中無一人被敵人截獲，無一人死傷。在這場艱鉅的秘密大營救中，香港及深圳兩地的通力合作，是營救得以成功極為重要的一環。同學稍後將在香港抗戰及海防博物館展開旅程。我們也十分感謝香港中國旅行社安排專業導賞帶領同學了解事件的前因後果、營救路線的決策，追溯當年的烽火歲月；接着會去到西貢斬竹灣烈士墓園，以及昔日大營救的指揮機關和接待站所在地的深圳中國文化名人大營救紀念館等，深入了解那場行動的周密與艱險。

透過這條寓教於遊的紅色研學路線，我們希望能夠讓廣大市民和旅客在實地走訪中，切身感受歷史的厚重和溫度，感悟愛國志士們捨生取義的英勇事蹟，從而更加深刻地認識到香港抗戰歷史。文化體育及旅遊局會繼續支持紅色研學旅遊的發展，與各界攜手開發更多結合歷史文化和旅遊體驗的項目，讓年輕一代在行走中學習，在體驗中感悟，將寶貴的精神財富轉化為建設香港、貢獻國家的強大動力。

我希望各位同學珍惜這次難得的學習機會，用心感受先輩們的崇高精神，將愛國情、強國志融入未來的學習與生活中，為實現中華民族偉大復興貢獻力量。

最後，我衷心祝願本次「中國文化名人大營救」香港深圳學習之旅活動圓滿成功，各位同學滿載而歸。謝謝大家。"

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；

戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-09 09:47,2025-10-09 10:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900211.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 9) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

香港高等教育體系再度為港增光　彰顯教育政策成效,2025-10-09 09:14,2025-10-09 09:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/09/P2025100900184.htm,"教育局發言人今日（十月九日）表示，根據國際高等教育機構泰晤士高等教育（THE）剛公布的二○二六年世界大學排名，大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學繼續位列頂尖，令香港成為全球唯一擁有五所大學躋身世界百強且所有上榜院校排名均有上升的城市，成績令人鼓舞，充分肯定香港專上教育界別精益求精、奮發圖強的成果，亦見證政府在建設香港成為國際專上教育樞紐上取得顯著進展。

根據最新THE世界大學排名，香港大學上升兩位至全球第33名，香港中文大學上升三位至第41名，香港科技大學上升八位至第58名，香港城市大學上升三位至第75名和香港理工大學上升一位至第83名繼續位列世界百強。此外，香港浸會大學的名次亦有所上升，而香港教育大學及嶺南大學則首次登上該排名榜。

當中，香港在多項關鍵指標均有亮眼表現，尤其在「教學聲譽」及「師生比」等方面表現持續提升。

香港專上教育高度國際化和多元化，並擁有優秀的教學及科研人才。在上月國際管理發展學院發布的《二○二五年世界人才排名》，香港躍升至第四位，成為亞洲之冠。是次THE世界大學排名亦再度印證政府在教育政策所取得的優異成果。

發言人說：「教育是強國建設、民族復興之基。香港一直積極配合國家教育強國戰略，建設香港成為國際專上教育樞紐及國際高端人才集聚高地。近年來，政府陸續推展一系列措施，包括提升政府資助的專上院校非本地學生限額，增加獎學金名額等；同時致力打造『留學香港』品牌，以及積極為院校擴容提質創造有利條件。」

為繼續鞏固及發揮香港專上教育的優勢，行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中宣布將進一步放寬自資收生限制、招攬更多國際教研人才和學生、加強產學研人才交流，以及建設北都大學城等，以增強香港的發展動能，亦為國家建設作出積極貢獻。

自二○二四／二五學年政府將教資會資助大學錄取非本地學生限額由20%提升一倍至40%後，修讀教資會資助課程的非本地學生人數按年錄得雙位數升幅，其學生來自超過100個國家及地區。為支持專上教育界繼續擴容提質，由二○二六／二七學年起，政府會在本地學生升學機會不受影響的大前提下，將放寬資助專上院校授課課程招收非本地生的自費就學人數上限，由相當於本地學額數目的40%增至50%；資助研究院研究課程的超額收生自資學額上限，亦由100%增至120%。此外，政府會成立跨部門的「留學香港專班」，加大推廣香港專上教育及優厚的學術、科研和國際合作資源，吸引更多學生及學者來港就學或進行研究。

發言人說：「這些成就充分肯定政府持續堅定投資教育，並積極引領香港專上教育界通過擴容提質、創新求變、打造一流大學和一流學科等政策措施所取得的成效。未來十年，隨着國家教育高速發展，香港教育亦將迎來黃金時期。我們會繼續深化香港作為國際專上教育樞紐和人才集聚的角色，抓緊機遇，發揮優勢，為香港和國家的發展貢獻力量。」"

海關強調買賣私煙同屬違法。根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Hong Kong Customs raids two suspected illicit cigarette storage centres (with photos),2025-10-08 18:33,2025-10-08 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800663.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (October 8) detected two illicit cigarette cases and raided two suspected illicit cigarette storage centres in Kwai Chung and Kwun Tong. About 350 000 suspected illicit cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $1.6 million and a duty potential of about $1.2 million were seized. Three persons suspected to be connected with the cases were arrested.

In the first case, Customs officers conducted an anti-illicit cigarette operation in Kwai Chung this morning and seized about 290 000 suspected illicit cigarettes inside a subdivided flat in an industrial building on Wo Yi Hop Road. A 33-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman, both claiming to be unemployed, suspected to be connected with the case were arrested.

In the second case, Customs officers conducted an anti-illicit cigarette operation in Kwun Tong in the same morning and intercepted a suspicious man in an industrial building on Hing Yip Street. Two thousand two hundred suspected illicit cigarettes were seized from his backpack, and the 62-year-old man, who claimed to be a transportation worker, was subsequently arrested. Later, Customs officers escorted the man to a mini-storage facility in the industrial building for a search and further seized about 61 000 suspected illicit cigarettes.

After preliminary investigations, Customs believed that the suspected illicit cigarette storage centres were primarily used to supply illicit cigarettes to areas in Kwai Chung and Kowloon East. Customs will continue to trace the source of the illicit cigarettes, and the likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

The three arrested persons were charged with ""dealing with goods to which the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance applies"". The two arrestees from the first case will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 9). The arrestee from the second case will appear at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on November 10.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that it is an offence to buy or sell illicit cigarettes. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-08 18:15,2025-10-08 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800665.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月八日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

病人為十一歲男童，住所位於深水埗區。初步調查顯示，他於十月四日至七日到訪廣東省深圳市、佛山市和中山市，十月七日回港當日出現發燒及皮疹，由家人帶到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

病人的一名家居接觸者曾一同到廣東，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處廣東省，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得28宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-08 18:15,2025-10-08 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800661.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 8), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

âThe case involves an 11-year-old boy living in Sham Shui Po District. Preliminary investigations revealed that he visited Shenzhen, Foshan, and Zhongshan in Guangdong between October 4 and 7. Upon returning to Hong Kong, he developed a fever and rash and was taken by a family member to the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital for medical attention on October 7. He was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the Chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

A household contact of the patient had travelled with him to Guangdong and is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Guangdong during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 28 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
立法會：公務員事務局局長就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節）致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-08 18:11,2025-10-08 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800657.htm,"以下是公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節：深化改革心繫民生、「一國兩制」行穩致遠、強化治理體系和粵港澳大灣區建設）的致辭全文：

主席︰

首先，我感謝李慧琼議員動議的致謝議案，亦感謝多位立法會議員對公務員事務提出的寶貴意見。

一直以來，公務員在參與制訂、推動和執行政策，以及為市民提供優質公共服務方面，都肩負重任。一支高效專業、竭誠服務的公務員隊伍，有助政府制訂惠民的政策以及政策成功落地推行。本屆政府自上任以來，致力推動政府治理體系改革。過去兩年，這些工作已得到一定的成果。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》中，香港在「政府效率」排名世界第二，反映香港公務員整體是一支優秀的隊伍，亦是本屆政府的改革和公務員共同努力的成果。

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》提出一系列政策措施，以持續提升政府團隊落實執行政策的責任和效率。

《施政報告》就「進一步強化治理」有兩個重點項目。第一個是部門首長責任制。我感謝議員在各場合表達對建立責任制的支持，並就有關內容及執行提供了不少寶貴的意見。我想藉此機會向大家提一些重點。

首先，公務員一直以來都要為其工作績效問責，《公務員守則》已清楚說明這一點。部門首長亦一向要對部門的表現負上責任，只是政府一直未將有關責任整體制度化。行政長官提出建立部門首長責任制，不但可以清楚強調部門首長必須負責建立好管理團隊，帶領屬下高級公務員做好管理的工作，更可把司局長就制定政策須要政治問責和公務員就執行政策須要行政問責，兩者更好銜接起來，使兩者的角色更清晰。

部門首長責任制是通過要求部門首長承擔責任，推動部門首長建立有效的管理團隊和運作系統，亦強調高級公務員必須輔助部門首長履行管理責任，一層一層地做好對轄下人員的管理和督導工作。各層級的公務員都盡職履責，整個部門才可發揮最大效能。

責任制亦建立了固定機制，當部門的工作出現問題時，可按照問題大小輕重，清晰分為兩個級別處理：第一級調查機制會處理一些一般性質的問題，由部門首長進行調查。如部門出現嚴重問題，或涉及廣泛或重複性的系統問題，或有跡象顯示問題可能涉及部門首長的角色，有關局長可在獲得其所屬司長同意後啓動第二級獨立調查機制，由公務員敍用委員會進行獨立調查；司長亦可主動指示相關局長啓動調查機制。

公務員敍用委員會領導的小組會進行全面的調查，找出問題表象背後的成因。小組可因應需要邀請專家或不涉及被調查個案的政府人員參與調查；小組亦可調查任何級別公務員，並會涵蓋所有涉事的公務員和單位。剛才有議員對公務員敍用委員會表達一個憂慮，他們是否能夠真正做到獨立﹖其實，委員會歷任主席及成員行事均公正無私，過去亦就部門的紀律、招聘和晉升等政策及個案，作出不少的批評和建議，他們的公信力是毋庸置疑。

正如行政長官提到，責任制是讓部門首長履責「系統化、制度化、清晰化、肯定化、公平化、效率化」。我們會盡快草擬規例，以實行由公務員敍用委員會進行上述第二級的調查。公務員學院亦會設立部門首長／副首長主動領導培訓計劃，以加強他們的領導思維和部門管理能力。

另一個重點項目是強化公務員評核機制。人力是我們最寶貴的資源，我們必須發揮好公務員的才能，才可以進一步提升服務效率及效能。建立更嚴謹的評核機制，既可鼓勵優秀的公務員精益求精、提振他們的士氣；亦讓管方可針對性地協助工作能力不足的員工提升能力，和處理少數長期工作表現欠佳的人員。我感謝議員支持這個項目，亦分享了不同機構的做法給我們參考。我們會加以研究，並預計在二○二六年內推出措施，以更清晰地分辨員工的工作表現水平，從而進一步強化賞罰分明制度。

幾位議員剛才都提到，以往部分公務員有少做少錯、不做不錯、不求有功、但求無過的態度，亦都有人憂慮部門首長責任制及強化公務員評核機制，會否導致公務員因為怕犯錯、怕被問責而發展出這些態度。正如剛才政務司司長提到，公務員和政府部門現時的工作文化其實並不是這樣，例如部門是設有一系列的工作指標和服務承諾，部門亦會更加廣泛地應用科技，亦正在全力配合縮減公務員編制。公務員有清晰的使命和工作目標，工作是主動的、積極的，以及對市民的要求和需要是有高度的敏感度。現時的實況是不做一定錯，少做或者做不足他們的責任要求都是錯。

我們亦會為持續提升公務員的能力、擴闊其視野去強化公務員培訓。去年《施政報告》提出「政府治理人才培育計劃」，協助政府建立人才庫。公務員學院已在今夏推出這計劃，稍後會進行遴選面試。學員將會獲安排參加一連串多元化的培訓項目，部門或職系領導層亦會參與培訓與指導。

我們亦會積極推動愛國主義教育，協助公務員樹立正確的歷史觀，認清自身貢獻國家和香港發展的責任。另外，在中央政府的支持下，我們會選拔新一批優秀的青年公務員參與聯合國初級專業人員方案，前往聯合國辦事處任職，豐富公務員參與國際組織事務的經驗。另外，公務員事務局亦會安排有潛質的中高級公務員到海外院校進修。

主席，在行政長官帶領下，我們不斷深化改革，強化治理體系。我們會全力落實《施政報告》內有關公務員管理的各項措施，繼續精益求精，並以盡忠竭誠、砥礪奮進、敢於創新的精神，全力協助行政長官施政，積極服務市民，為國家、為香港的發展作出貢獻。

本人謹此陳辭，懇請議員支持議案。"

完稅標籤制度先導計劃旨在於實際操作環境中，透過模擬制度的運作流程及相關技術，以評估其效能及可行性，並讓業界及市民認識該制度的重點內容，以及提早作出相關合規準備。

海關人員會於先導計劃第一階段期間，在指定管制站內的海關課稅室，為由旅客帶入香港或以單一次付運方式進口香港、並已繳付全額稅款且未開封的每個香煙的零售封包，附貼試行完稅標籤。指定管制站包括落馬洲支線、港珠澳大橋香港口岸和香港國際機場指定貨運站。同時，海關亦邀請本地煙草製造商參與先導計劃，在擬於本地市場銷售的香煙的零售封包附貼試行完稅標籤。故此，一些已附貼試行完稅標籤的香煙將會在市場上供應。

試行完稅標籤的設計採用物理及數碼防偽特徵。海關人員及市民可使用指定管制站或香煙零售點所設置的專用儀器掃描試行完稅標籤上的加密二維碼，以確認相關香煙的完稅狀態。為方便識別，海關人員及本地製造商所附貼的試行完稅標籤分別為藍色和綠色。

先導計劃屬自願參與性質。香港海關歡迎市民以問卷表達對先導計劃的建議和意見。待完成中期評估後，香港海關會將先導計劃推行至更多邊境口岸的海關課稅室。"
Hong Kong Customs launches pilot run for duty stamp system for three months (with photos),2025-10-08 18:00,2025-10-08 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800611.htm,"According to the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (Cap. 109) amended by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region through the Tobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, the duty stamp system will be implemented to help distinguish between duty-paid and duty-not-paid cigarettes. Hong Kong Customs launched a three-month pilot run for the duty stamp system on October 6 and plans to implement the first phase of the system in the fourth quarter of 2026, followed by full implementation in the second quarter of 2027.

  The pilot run for the duty stamp system aims to simulate workflow and technology in practical operations to evaluate their effectiveness and feasibility, as well as to promote industry and public awareness of the key features of the system that enable them to prepare related compliance in advance.

  In the first phase of the pilot run, Customs officers at Duty Collection Offices of designated control points, namely the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and selected cargo terminals of Hong Kong International Airport, will affix a trial duty stamp to each unopened retail package of cigarettes brought into Hong Kong by incoming passengers or imported for single shipments upon full duty payment. Meanwhile, local tobacco manufacturers are also invited to join the pilot run and affix trial duty stamps to retail packages of cigarettes intended for local sale. Therefore, cigarettes that bear the trial duty stamps will be supplied on the market later.

  The trial duty stamps are designed to bear both physical and digital anti-counterfeiting features. Customs officers and members of the public can scan the encrypted QR code on the trial duty stamp using dedicated devices available at the designated control points or retail outlets to ascertain the duty-paid status of the cigarettes. For easy identification, trial duty stamps affixed by Customs officers and local manufacturers are respectively in blue and green colours.

  Participation in the pilot run is voluntary. Hong Kong Customs welcomes the public to give suggestions and views on the pilot run throughquestionnaires. After the mid-term evaluation, Hong Kong Customs will extend the pilot run to more Duty Collection Offices at various control points."

立法會：保安局局長就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節）致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-08 17:50,2025-10-08 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800600.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節：深化改革 心繫民生、「一國兩制」行穩致遠、強化治理體系和粵港澳大灣區建設）的致辭全文︰

主席、各位議員：

首先，我感謝內會主席就《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出致謝議案。

我會先就維護國家安全的議題發言，然後會就其他與保安範疇相關的議題作扼要回應。

維護國家安全

在維護國家安全方面，今年六月三十日是《香港國安法》公布實施五周年的重要里程碑。我感謝立法會於去年全票通過、制訂了《維護國家安全條例》，完成了特區就《基本法》第二十三條立法的憲制責任。在二○二五年五月刊憲生效的兩項根據《維護國家安全條例》訂立的附屬法例，以及我們剛向政府人員發布的《政府人員維護國家安全工作指引》，都是特區的重要工作成果。現時，《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》和香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律已經築牢了香港特區在維護國家安全方面的屏障。

除了法律制度和執行機制外，我們會持續全力防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，做到有法必依、執法必嚴、違法必究。

同時，我們會繼續以多管齊下的策略，將宣傳推廣和教育工作做得更深更廣。

在這方面，特區政府在過去幾年已先後推出了國家安全展覽廳、國家安全地區導師、社區國安教育課程等。我們亦擴大了全港學界國家安全常識挑戰賽的規模，和推出了《安仔與熊仔》國家安全漫畫、動漫和實體繪本。

我們計劃用《安仔與熊仔》動漫系列作為藍本，公演國安話劇；亦會在本學年以短劇形式向小學生呈現。此外，約80名保安局青少年制服團隊領袖論壇義工會到幼稚園參與以《安仔與熊仔》為主題的工作坊，將國家安全的信息帶入幼稚園。

善用科技

AI、人面識別

今年的《施政報告》中，有效應用AI技術亦是施政重點之一。就此，保安局會積極配合這方面的工作。

其中，在推動「數碼警政」發展方面，警務處將會推出人工智能警務站，市民可以透過語音向智能虛擬警務大使作非緊急的報案。警務處計劃在二○二六年第二季，在港鐵中環站設置第一個人工智能警務站。

另外，香港海關亦計劃在二○二五年第四季，在羅湖口岸和落馬洲支線口岸引入「海關人工智能影像分析大數據系統」，利用人工智能科技，在各個口岸加強識別高走私風險的人士，令我們可以更精準地偵測到可疑的旅客和辨識犯罪集團，以及提升旅客的清關效率和執法成效。而在二○二七年年底前，海關會將整套系統逐步推展到其他口岸。

除了AI外，保安局亦積極運用其他科技，例如人面識別。入境處已經在二○二五年九月底，在機場入境大堂推出名為「容易飛」的e-道新功能，讓合資格的香港居民可以免登記、免出示旅行證件或者二維碼，在機場入境時以容貌識別技術核實身分和辦理入境手續。

入境處亦將會在港珠澳大橋香港口岸設立全港第一個「無感通關」試點，讓巿民透過人面辨識科技核實身分，實現不停頓過關。這是第一次在關口推行「無感通關」。入境處計劃在二○二六年第二季首先開放予已登記的香港居民作為先導計劃使用。

其他重點善用科技措施

另外，自從「銳眼計劃」推出、在罪案較多和人流較多的公眾地方安裝閉路電視以來，成效顯著。截至二○二五年八月三十一日，已經協助警方偵破了433宗案件，拘捕了787人。警務處將會進一步推展這個計劃，每年增加超過20 000支鏡頭，預計在二○二八年，有共約60 000支鏡頭覆蓋全港。

而為了向業主提供更好的消防安全改善工程支援，消防處將會在二○二五年年底前推行「物聯網火警偵測系統先導計劃」，以這個系統和滅火筒作為替代方案，讓六層或以下的目標樓宇無須裝設消防喉轆、消防水缸和水泵等消防裝置。先導計劃將會在10幢目標樓宇推行。

滅罪應急

除了上述的工作外，我們亦有多項滅罪應急措施。

打擊非法勞工

在打擊非法勞工方面，為了加大打擊的力度，我們已經成立了跨部門反黑工專責組，透過制訂應對非法勞工的整體策略、強化情報搜集和與內地情報交換、嚴厲執法、善用科技，以及協調相關宣傳和教育等方面加強跨部門協調。我們亦推出新的舉報非法勞工專線。自專線推出兩星期以來，入境處已經收到過百宗電話舉報。

政府嚴打非法勞工亦有助減低濫用免遣返聲請機制的經濟誘因。政府會繼續採取多管齊下的策略，以高效率處理聲請，盡快遣送聲請不獲確立的人離開香港，從而減低聲請人滯港而對社會所帶來的沉重負擔和安全風險。

「無人機警政」先導計劃

警務處亦會積極推行「無人機警政」。繼在今年五月在邊界警區和西九龍總區試行，警務處將會在今年內進一步擴展到在長洲分區和中區警區執行飛行任務，以提升巡邏效率。

便民利商

除了滅罪應急工作和善用科技之外，我們亦推出多項便民利商措施，以配合特區政府發展經濟。

開放邊境禁區

我們已經開放沙頭角海的禁區範圍，讓旅客可以申請禁區證遊覽；並將會在二○二六年年中取消米埔邊境禁區。措施實施後，除了過境設施和邊界巡邏路外，所有邊境禁區都會開放。

新建口岸實施「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式

口岸方面，我們會繼續提升口岸基礎建設和通關能力。重建後的皇崗口岸將會實施「一地兩檢」安排，和採用嶄新的「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式。我們會爭取在本屆政府任期內，讓這個口岸具備落成啓用的條件。至於沙頭角口岸項目則會用「跨河建」的安排重建，並實施「合作查驗、一次放行」的通關模式。這個口岸重建後將會成為純旅檢口岸。

說好香港

主辦多項國際會議和成立國際協會

我們亦會繼續說好香港故事。來年，我們會繼續舉行大型國際會議，包括二○二六年國際刑警組織周年大會，和應急與航空醫療國際研討會等。這些活動的目標是強化國際間的紀律部隊和專業團體的合作和交流。

結語

主席，以上是我對各位議員寶貴意見的扼要回應。來年，保安局會繼續帶領轄下的紀律部隊積極落實二○二五年度的《施政報告》中的各項措施。

主席，我謹此陳辭，請議員支持二○二五年度的《施政報告》。多謝大家。"
立法會：政制及內地事務局局長就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節）致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-08 17:48,2025-10-08 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800583.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節：深化改革心繫民生、「一國兩制」行穩致遠、強化治理體系和粵港澳大灣區建設）的致辭全文︰

主席：

十分感謝李慧琼議員動議的致謝議案，以及各位議員在這個辯論環節所作出的發言和建議。我現在就《行政長官2025年施政報告》中有關堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」方針、落實「愛國者治港」原則、推動愛國主義教育，以及深化粵港澳大灣區協同發展的政策範疇作出回應。

堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」方針

國家主席習近平強調，「一國兩制」的根本宗旨是維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，保持香港長期繁榮穩定。「一國兩制」是香港回歸後保持長期繁榮穩定的最佳制度安排，必須長期堅持。「一國」原則愈堅固，「兩制」優勢愈彰顯。

特區政府會一如既往，全面準確、堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」、「港人治港」、高度自治的方針，維護《憲法》和《基本法》確立的特區憲制秩序，貫徹落實經完善的選舉制度，全面落實「愛國者治港」原則。

落實「愛國者治港」原則

正如習主席強調，「把香港特別行政區管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中，這是保證香港長治久安的必然要求，任何時候都不能動搖。」

我們會致力確保在新選舉制度下的公共選舉均在公平、公正、誠實和安全有序下順利進行，讓市民選出愛國愛港、有志服務社會的人士進入管治體系，共同建設美好香港。

在完善特區選舉制度及地區治理體系後，我們已成功舉辦了六場重要的選舉。選舉委員會界別分組補選剛剛在今年九月七日順利舉行。整體投票和點票過程十分暢然有序，點票工作得以在兩個多小時內高效完成。我們會總結補選的寶貴經驗，繼續與選管會（選舉管理委員會）及選舉事務處以穩中求進的態度，持續優化選舉的各項流程和安排。

立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，我們正與選管會密鑼緊鼓進行各項相關籌備工作。我們亦會做好選舉宣傳，以及持續推廣經完善選舉制度的優越性和重要性，加強市民對選舉制度的認識，呼籲選民關心選舉，踴躍投票。

推動愛國主義教育

習主席又表示：「愛國主義是中華民族精神的核心。」「對每一個中國人來說，愛國是本分，也是職責，是心之所繫、情之所歸。」

特區政府高度重視在特區傳承和弘揚愛國主義精神，並決心構建以愛國愛港為核心、與「一國兩制」方針相適應的主流價值觀。「愛國主義教育工作小組」自去年四月成立以來已進行了大量卓有成效的工作，我們日後會繼續研究推出更多切合香港實際情況的愛國主義教育政策措施。

今年是抗戰勝利80周年。特區政府以「銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平、開創未來」為主題，推展一系列紀念和教育活動，傳承和弘揚偉大的抗戰精神，包括由行政長官率領的香港代表團到北京參加九三閱兵、特區政府舉行官方紀念儀式、行政長官向老戰士頒發由國家授予的紀念章，以及舉辦各種大型專題展覽等。

特區政府會繼續梳理及修繕保護全港各區的中共抗戰遺址，以及繼續推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施並將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地，鼓勵更多香港學生和青年到訪。同時，我們會與愛國團體建立密切關係，協同舉辦更多愛國主義教育活動。

此外，我們又會加強《憲法》和《基本法》的宣傳教育，加強市民對《憲法》、《基本法》、國家安全以及「一國兩制」的認識。

深化粵港澳大灣區協同發展

粵港澳大灣區建設是習主席親自謀劃、親自部署、親自推動的重大國家戰略。我們會錨定習主席提出的「一點兩地」新定位，使大灣區成為新發展格局的戰略支點、高質量發展的示範地、中國式現代化的引領地。

在中央的大力支持下，香港特區與其他灣區城市優勢互補，緊密合作，共建灣區高質量發展，一批批成功政策的出台亦大大促進了灣區的一體化進程，對香港企業和人才用好灣區機遇，以及推動大灣區各城市間的高水平融合發展，發揮了關鍵作用。

香港是大灣區中心城市和區域發展的核心引擎之一，在大灣區建設中肩負着引領帶動的重任。特區政府會積極與中央相關部委、廣東省政府及澳門特區政府保持緊密聯繫，繼續深化粵港澳三地的規則銜接和機制對接，促進人流、物流、信息流、資金流等重要生產要素在區內高效流動，爭取更多惠港利民、促進灣區融合發展的政策措施，助力國家進一步深化改革和高水平對外開放，積極融入國家發展大局。

特區政府亦會充分發揮香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，擔當好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要角色，致力發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台關鍵作用，並會繼續說好灣區故事，對外宣傳推廣大灣區建設的重大機遇。

結語

主席，行政長官今年《施政報告》的主題是「深化改革、心繫民生、發揮優勢、同創未來」。行政長官強調，這份《施政報告》既是香港全力「拼經濟、謀發展、惠民生」、加快邁向「由治及興」的進程表，亦是香港主動對接國家發展戰略、實現突破新局面的策略部署。

我懇請各位議員支持《施政報告》，支持致謝議案，讓我們一起共同建設更美好的香港家園，同時為國家的強國建設和中華民族偉大復興作出新的更大貢獻。

主席，我謹此陳辭。多謝主席。"

主席：

感謝各位議員提出的寶貴意見。尤其多位議員對創新科技應用和相關的法律配套、支援內地企業出海、推動粵港澳大灣區法治建設等方面的工作表達支持。我想藉此機會作扼要回應。

（一）法律科技的推廣和應用

律政司一直致力推廣香港法律業界更廣泛地使用法律科技，促進法律科技在香港的發展及應用。

行政長官在去年的《施政報告》中提到的推動法律科技發展諮詢小組已於今年年初成立，成員包括法律界、學界及法律科技專家，協助政府制定法律科技政策，推動業界提升效率和競爭力。

在小組的協助下，我們以舉辦法律科技圓桌會議等活動方式，推動業界應用法律科技，提高業界對法律科技的認識，鼓勵法律從業員改變舊有思維。

此外，我們將於今年十二月舉行的香港法律周期間啓動首屆香港法律科技節，進行一系列推廣法律科技相關活動，包括本年度第四場壓軸的法律科技圓桌會議、介紹最新法律科技的展覽與現場演示等，務求與各位持份者共同探討法律與人工智能的融合領域及最新發展。

律政司已於今年九月中開展香港法律科技服務提供者問卷調查，以掌握國際市場上法律科技的最新發展，為日後推動法律科技的政策提供參考。

（二）檢視廣泛應用AI（人工智能）所需的法律配套

科技應用不單止有助提升法律界的效率，更是香港未來競爭力的關鍵因素。行政長官在今年《施政報告》中指出，政府會加大推動AI作為香港未來發展的核心產業，在重視防範安全風險的意識下推進AI+發展。

香港現時並無專門的法例規管AI。而AI的應用愈趨廣泛，政府有需要檢視相關的法律配套，讓政府在積極推動創科發展，鞏固香港領先地位的同時，保障社會不同持份者的合法權益。就此，我們會成立跨部門工作小組，協調政策局檢視更廣泛應用AI所需的法律配套。

（三）以香港法律及專業服務支援內地企業出海

《施政報告》明確香港要發揮出海平台作用，協助內地企業開拓海外新興市場。這樣做不但讓香港能夠貢獻所長，服務國家，同時亦為香港的經濟發展注入新的動力。行政長官已指示由我專責推廣香港法律服務，協同其他專業如會計、金融等，支援內地企業出海。

下一步，我們會聚焦法律和其他專業服務推廣，加強與其他部門和專業服務界別的協作，主動對接內地企業，整合專業服務提供者資訊，共同為內地企業提供出海專業服務，制定多元方案，發揮香港「走出去、引進來」的雙向平台作用。

（四）深化大灣區內法律合作

粵港澳大灣區是國家經濟發展的重要引擎，亦是香港未來發展的關鍵。深化粵港澳三地規則銜接與機制對接，是粵港澳大灣區建設的重要工作，亦是香港更好地對接國家戰略的把手。

建立大灣區仲裁員名冊

就此，律政司將推動粵港澳三地共同訂立大灣區仲裁員名冊，設立大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，在大灣區各城市推廣大灣區調解、大灣區仲裁，落實灣區標準，加強規則銜接，通過資源共享降低企業跨境糾紛的解決成本。

律政司與廣東和澳門的法律部門亦已於今年正式發布及實施《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊工作指引》，正進行各自的本地推薦程序，力求在今年內公布首批大灣區仲裁員名單。仲裁員名單能便利三地仲裁員在大灣區提供法律與爭議解決服務，為大灣區注入更多仲裁人才，為當事人提供更廣泛的選擇，推動大灣區非訴訟爭議解決機制的「軟聯通」。

粵港澳大灣區調解平台

粵港澳大灣區三地政府法律部門為促進調解工作設立了大灣區調解平台。大灣區調解平台已就三個範疇訂立了大灣區內共同採納的標準，包括《調解員資格資歷評審標準》、《調解員專業操守最佳準則》和《跨境爭議調解示範規則》。

去年十二月，粵港澳三地法律部門發布了統一的粵港澳大灣區調解員名冊。名冊上共有146名來自香港及廣東、澳門地區的調解員，其中經香港評審的大灣區調解員有49名。三地會於今年第四季再次進行粵港澳大灣區調解員本地評審，目標在今年內公布二○二五年大灣區調解員名冊，為大灣區的法律服務市場注入更多優質的調解人才。

大灣區律師聯會

另一方面，在司法部的支持下，我們將力爭在本年內設立大灣區律師聯會，加強支援大灣區律師的專業發展。大灣區法律資訊平台目前亦正有序推進，爭取明年上半年成立，促進灣區內法治信息的互通。

結語

主席，我們將繼續虛心聆聽議員的意見，與業界合作，推動香港法律服務業的發展。本人謹此陳辭，希望各位議員支持今日的致謝議案。多謝主席。"
立法會：政務司副司長就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節）致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-08 17:45,2025-10-08 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800491.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節︰深化改革心繫民生、「一國兩制」行穩致遠、強化治理體系、粵港澳大灣區建設）的致辭︰

主席：

在二○二五年《年施政報告》，行政長官指派我負責幾項跨部門督導、統籌和協調工作，當中包括領導人工智能（AI）效能提升組，推動部門善用科技提升政府效能，為市民提供更優質的政府服務。

AI效能提升組

成立AI效能提升組有三個目標：（一）統籌和指導各政府部門於工作中有效應用AI技術；（二）研究重組部門工作流程；及（三）推動部門進行科技革新，提升效能。透過這三方面的工作，我們會檢視部門現時的工作流程及科技應用，以新思維、新科技，使政府的工作能在科技創新的大環境下，與時並進，不論是處理政府內部的日常運作，還是為市民提供服務，都能提升效率、精益求精，讓政府的資源得到善用，及為市民在使用政府服務時，帶來更好的體驗，增加市民的獲得感和幸福感。

AI效能提升組會由我擔任組長，創新科技及工業局局長出任副組長，和數字政策專員為秘書長。小組亦會邀請一位業界代表擔任副組長，以引入市場思維及實務經驗。

AI的用途十分廣泛。政府部門日常的草擬、紀錄、處理查詢、收集數據、搜尋資料、資料共享、撰寫文案、處理登記、審批申請、制定工作重點名單、監察工作成效等工作，都可以考慮應用AI。重組工作流程亦可以藉着減省、調動工作程序，以至使用新的工作方法，令工作更順暢和更有效率。就此，AI效能提升組會主動檢視各部門主要業務的流程和科技應用，以提供針對性的AI應用、流程重組和數字轉型方案。

AI效能提升組會物色數個具影響力和擴展性的AI旗艦項目，加快公共服務革新，同時用作成功示範，推動其他部門進行同類改革。數字政策辦公室（數字辦）亦會提供AI工具箱，推動局／部門在數據分析、客戶服務及文書等日常工作上更廣泛應用AI技術。

我們會在下星期舉行第一次會議，商討AI效能提升組的工作計劃及時間表，並會向行政長官作出匯報。我們的目標是在二○二六年開展相關項目，包括在二○二六年內推出涵蓋100個政務環節的AI工具，以及在二○二六至二七及二○二七至二八年度內陸續推出AI旗艦項目。

在創新科技及工業局向相關事務委員會簡報《施政報告》措施時，有議員問AI效能提升組的運作與現時數字辦的工作有何不同。AI效能提升組是指導統籌的高層設計。在這設計下，AI效能提升組會從政府中央的高度就不同局／部門的科技應用和業務流程，給予指導和指示，提高政府運作和服務的效能，並促進跨部門的數據共享互用。另一方面，數字辦的性質和作用是專業的業務部門。AI效能提升組由數字政策專員擔任秘書長，是利用數字辦在業務流程重整、數字技術應用、創新科技項目管理等範疇的經驗，協助AI效能提升組統籌提升政府效能的工作，對部門給予切實可行的指導和指示，並向部門提供專業意見和協助。

在今日的致謝議案辯論，有議員提到推行哪些AI項目，應由中央評估，以避免部門揀一些容易做到而未必是市民最需要的項目去推行。也有議員提到，AI效能提升組要留意部門可能因行政差異、流程固化等原因對推行革新項目有抵觸情緒，令推行AI效能提升的工作遇到阻力。

我感謝議員的意見。正如我之前的發言所說，AI效能提升組是會主動檢視各部門主要業務的流程和科技應用，並提供AI應用、流程重組方案。所以AI改革工作的內容是由AI效能提升組制定。我們在作出決定時，必然會考慮項目所具的效益。再者，香港公務員團隊是優秀的，正如政務司司長所講，在今年六月瑞士洛桑國際管理發展學院的《2025世界競爭力年報》中，香港政府效率獲評為世界第二。我很有信心，各部門會忠誠和專業的推行AI效能提升組下達的指導和指示，而提升組亦會對部門給予適當的指導，釋除他們推行工作時遇到的一些困難，做到上下一心，為市民提供更舒心的服務。

我亦感謝議員就AI效能提升組工作提出的其他意見，包括：


建議政府參考鄰近地區在推動AI公務應用的經驗；
在確保安全的基礎上，加快豐富AI政務應用；
項目應以市民和企業為主要對象，並應致力做到一網通辦，盡量減低中小企的營運成本；
善用AI技術於勞工處求職配對工作；以及
以AI及大數據分析地區問題，以預早及從速作出部署。


這些意見都非常有價值，亦是AI效能提升組會商討的工作方向，我們會認真和詳加考慮。我謹此陳辭，懇請議員支持通過致謝議案。"
立法會十二題：公營醫療人手,2025-10-08 17:35,2025-10-08 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800348.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上謝偉銓議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見指出，本港公營醫療系統面對人手短缺，前線醫護人員超時工作已成常態，有關情況影響員工身心健康及醫療服務質素。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，過去三年公營醫療系統的醫護人員的平均每周工作時數、超時工作時數、當值頻率及候召當值情況為何，並按職系列出分項資料；

（二）是否知悉，現時公營醫療系統的超時工作補償機制詳情為何；過去三年，各類醫護人員領取超時工作津貼或補償的人數，以及所涉及的金額分別為何；及

（三）為紓緩公營醫療系統人手不足（尤其是公立醫院醫護人員）的壓力，政府曾推行多項措施（包括引入非本地培訓醫療人才），有關措施的最新實施情況為何；如何透過「智慧醫療」及跨專業協作，以提升整體醫護人員效率？

答覆：

主席：

就謝偉銓議員的問題，經諮詢醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

香港擁有高水平的醫療專業和高效率的醫療系統，多項健康指標位居世界前列，為全球人均壽命最高（註一）而嬰兒死亡率最低的地區之一（註二）。二○二二至二三年度香港公共醫療衞生經常性開支相對本地生產總值的百分比只為4.1%（註三），與其他人口老化程度相若的經濟體比較，香港的相關開支比例屬於最低的地區之一，但已能提供全港接近九成醫療服務，並達致國際高水平的醫療質素，彰顯公營醫療系統的效率。

然而，香港醫療系統面對多項結構性挑戰。隨着人口長壽令香港整體人口高齡化，慢性疾病急速上升；優質而收費低廉的公營醫療服務吸引龐大服務需求，令醫療系統承受沉重壓力。有鑑於此，醫管局積極推行各項措施吸引及挽留人手，並應用資訊科技提升效率。

（一）根據醫管局現行政策，醫管局全體僱員的規定工作時數為每周總時數44小時。就員工當值安排，個別部門會按其運作需要編配。此外，超時工作是指僱員在規定工作時數以外的任何時間進行的工作，並一般以補假作償。醫管局並沒有就上述資料備存中央記錄，但個別部門會按運作需要備存超時工作時數記錄。就候召工作而言，醫管局設有候召補償定額酬金，以肯定醫生因工作性質需持續長時間工作的努力及貢獻。

醫管局一直密切監察人手情況，並在整體預算內持續推行多項措施以吸引、培訓和挽留人才，包括增加駐院醫生培訓名額以招聘本地醫科畢業生、招聘非本地培訓醫生以補充本地招聘工作、改善晉升機會以挽留員工、招聘兼職醫護人員（例如透過招聘自選兼職人員）、提供彈性全職工作安排、續聘合適的退休人員、優化購屋貸款利息津貼計劃，以及成立醫管局學院，以增加不同職系的培訓機會。

醫管局的人手情況持續改善。醫管局醫生的人手數目由二○○六至○七年度的4 617人增加至二○二三至二四年度的6 807人。醫管局醫生每周平均工時已由二○○六至○七年度（註四）的約55小時下降至二○二三至二四年度的約48.9小時，而每周平均工時超過65小時的醫生人數比例，亦由二○○六至○七年度約18%，下降至二○二三至二四年度約3.1%（註五）。同時，醫生的離職流失率由二○○六至○七年度6.3%，下降至二○二三至二四年度5.2%。

（二）有別於一般以補假形式補償超時工作的安排，醫管局亦設有特別酬金計劃，員工於正常工作時間之外自願提供服務，將獲發特別酬金，每小時金額按該員工現行基本薪金的1/140計算。計劃旨在緩解短期人手不足，並及時應對緊急情況，同時便於在特別項目下提供額外服務時數，以滿足運作需要。

LCQ12: Manpower for public healthcare,2025-10-08 17:35,2025-10-08 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800367.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Tony Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that with manpower shortages faced by Hong Kong's public healthcare system, it has become a norm for frontline healthcare personnel to work overtime and this not only affects their physical and mental wellbeing but also the quality of healthcare services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the average weekly working hours, overtime hours, frequency of duty shifts and on-site call duties of healthcare personnel in the public healthcare system in the past three years, with a breakdown by grade;

(2) whether it knows the details of the current overtime compensation mechanism in the public healthcare system; the respective numbers of healthcare personnel of various categories who received overtime allowance or compensation, and the amounts involved, in the past three years; and

(3) of the latest status of the implementation of various measures (including the recruitment of non-locally trained healthcare professionals) introduced by the Government as an effort to alleviate the pressure arising from manpower shortages in the public healthcare system (particularly among healthcare personnel in public hospitals); how the efficiency of healthcare personnel as a whole can be enhanced through smart healthcare and multi-disciplinary collaboration?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Tony Tse is as follows:

  With our high-quality healthcare professionals and highly efficient healthcare system, Hong Kong boasts a number of world-leading health indicators. We are among one of the regions with the longest life expectancies (note 1) and lowest infant mortality rate in the world (note 2). The public current health expenditures in Hong Kong only accounted for 4.1 per cent (note 3) of its Gross Domestic Product in 2022-23. Compared with other economies with a similar degree of population ageing, Hong Kong's related expenditure ratio is among the lowest. On the other hand, we were able to provide nearly 90 per cent of the city's healthcare services and achieve a high service quality on par with international standards, demonstrating the remarkable efficiency of our public healthcare system.

  Nevertheless, our healthcare system is facing various structural challenges. Longevity has led to an overall ageing population and a surging prevalence of chronic diseases in Hong Kong. Quality public healthcare services at affordable prices have attracted huge service demand, exerting immense pressure on the city's healthcare system. In light of the above, the HA is actively implementing various measures to attract and retain manpower, while leveraging information technology to enhance efficiency.

(1) Under the HA's existing policy, the conditioned hours of work for all employees are 44 hours gross per week. Regarding staff's rostering arrangements, individual departments allocate shifts according to operational needs. Furthermore, overtime work refers to any work undertaken over and above an employee's conditioned hours of work, and should normally be recompensed by time-off in lieu. The HA does not maintain centralised records for the above data, but individual departments maintain records of overtime hours worked due to operational needs. Regarding on-call duties, the HA provides the Fixed Rate Honorarium to recognise the efforts and contributions of doctors whose job nature requires sustained long working hours.

  The HA has been closely monitoring the manpower situation and has introduced a host of measures within the overall budget to attract, train and retain talents, including increasing the quotas of resident trainees to recruit local medical graduates; recruiting non-locally trained doctors (NLTDs) to complement the local recruitment; enhancing promotion opportunities for staff retention; recruiting part-time healthcare staff (e.g. through the recruitment of locum staff); providing flexible full-time working arrangements; rehiring suitable retirees; enhancing the Home Loan Interest Subsidy Scheme, and establishing the HA Academy to enhance training opportunities for different grades of staff members.

  The HA's manpower situation has been steadily improving. The number of doctors working in the HA has increased from 4 617 in 2006-07 to 6 807 in 2023-24. The average number of weekly working hours for HA doctors has seen a reduction from about 55 hours in 2006-07 (note 4) to about 48.9 hours in 2023-24. The proportion of doctors working over 65 hours per week has also fallen from about 18 per cent in 2006-07 to about 3.1 per cent (note 5) in 2023-24. Meanwhile, the attrition rate of doctors has also decreased from 6.3 per cent in 2006-07 to 5.2 per cent in 2023-24.

(2) Unlike the general practice of recompensing overtime work through time-off, the HA has also in place the Special Honorarium Scheme (SHS). Staff members who join the SHS outside normal work hours on a voluntary basis shall receive a special honorarium calculated at an hourly rate of 1/140 of their current basic salary. SHS aims to alleviate short-term staffing shortages and respond promptly to emergencies, while facilitating the provision of extra service sessions under special programmes to meet operational needs.

  The numbers of medical and nursing staff receiving payment for SHS and the amounts involved (note 6, 7, 8) for 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 are set out in the following tables:

2022-23

(3) Apart from recruiting local medical graduates, the HA also actively recruits NLTDs and engages professional healthcare talent through different global platforms for exchange programmes in Hong Kong. This serves to expand the talent pool of the public healthcare system so as to support the HA's service demands and development. As of August 31, 2025, a total of 330 NLTDs have worked or participated in exchange programmes within the HA. The HA has also earlier completed the indicator set out in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" to ""have no less than 250 NLTDs working in the HA by end-2024"".

  Regarding the recruitment of non-locally trained nurses (NLTNs), subsequent to the passage of the Nurses Registration (Amendment) Ordinance in July 2024, the HA has launched a series of promotional campaigns to attract NLTNs from around the world to join the HA. In addition, the HA is actively developing nurse exchange programmes with various non-local partner institutions. As of August 31, 2025, a cumulative total of 324 NLTNs have practised or participated in exchange programmes within the HA.

  Meanwhile, the HA has been actively advancing smart healthcare by leveraging technologies such as AI, smart wards, smart clinics, smart support and digital workspaces to optimise the clinical and administrative workflows, thereby enhancing the healthcare service quality and operational efficiency. For example, the HA is strengthening the clinical application of AI to assist doctors in drafting medical reports, imaging analysis of Computed Tomography, and providing real-time interpretation services during patient consultations. Regarding smart wards, the HA utilises electronic displays and paperless workflows to provide real-time patient information and improve safety. As for smart clinics, specialist out-patients clinics and general out-patients clinics under the HA have in place the ""e-Vitals"" systems to enable patients to self-report vital signs data, thereby streamlining follow-up procedures and reducing data entry errors. As for smart support, the HA employs digital dashboards and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance operational management, while deploying multifunctional robots to assist with administrative tasks, alleviating the workload of healthcare staff. Furthermore, the HA has established digital workspaces to facilitate multi-platform real-time communication, ward management and office automation as well as foster cross-departmental collaboration. These measures have improved efficiency, reduced patient waiting times and rationalised hospital admission processes.

Note 1: Provisional figures for average life expectancy at birth in 2024 were 82.8 for male and 88.4 for female.

Note 2: Provisional figures for the infant mortality rate in 2024 were 1.7 deaths per 1 000 registered live births.

Note 3: Excluding identified COVID-19 expenditures.

Note 4: The HA has maintained relevant data since 2006-07.

Note 5: Comprehensive monitoring of all specialties has been conducted biennially since 2011. Therefore, the HA is unable to provide the average weekly working hours of doctors in 2024-25. The HA is in the process of data collection for the average weekly working hours of doctors in 2025-26, thus relevant data cannot be provided at the moment.

Note 6: The number of staff receiving SHS payment in 2022-23, 2023-24 and 2024-25 is calculated based on headcounts as at March 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025 respectively.

問題：

有意見指出，儘管政府不斷呼籲市民在惡劣天氣情況下遠離危險區域，但仍有不少人不理勸告追風逐浪，該等行為不僅對自身生命安全造成嚴重威脅，亦加重政府救援部門的工作負擔和佔用公共應急資源。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去兩年，政府共收到多少宗市民在惡劣天氣警告信號（包括黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告，以及三號或以上熱帶氣旋警告）生效期間，無視政府呼籲進行高風險活動（例如追風、觀浪、游泳等）而遇險求助的個案；香港消防處及政府飛行服務隊展開就該等求助個案所進行的搜索及救援行動的平均成本為何；

（二）會否檢視現時法例，就市民在惡劣天氣警告下進行高風險活動的行為制訂明確罰則，例如就在暴雨警告信號生效期間進入高危地點（例如海邊、山澗、堤岸等）制訂嚴厲罰則，以加強阻嚇力；如會，具體詳情（包括時間表）為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）據報有家長在極端天氣下仍帶兒童前往高危區域，政府會否因應該等罔顧危險的行為，進一步完善有關照顧及看管兒童的法規，包括明確界定該等行為的違法性質及加強相關罰則；政府會如何透過家校溝通和社區親子活動等渠道進行家庭教育，提升家長群體在極端天氣下的安全意識？

答覆：

主席：

近年極端天氣越趨頻繁，每逢風暴來襲，政府均事先透過各種渠道提醒市民保持警惕，切勿冒險追風逐浪，又反覆呼籲市民遠離高危地點。惟仍有個別的人罔顧自身及家人的安全，帶同年幼子女前往海邊或高危地點追風逐浪，罔顧他們的安危。

政府強烈譴責颱風期間的追風逐浪等罔顧安全、極度自私的行為。追風逐浪的人往往低估風暴的風險，且過度高估自身逃生能力。這種極不負責任的行為不僅危及自身及子女安全，萬一遇到事故，更令拯救他們的救援人員置於極度危險境地。此等行為會增加公共救援服務的負擔，不當分散真正急需救援人士的資源，損害公眾利益。

救援部隊沒有備存相關開支的統計資料。

（二）政府高度關注並嚴厲譴責個別的人在惡劣天氣期間進行高風險活動，甚至帶同年幼子女前往海邊或高危地點觀浪的行為。警務處、康樂及文化事務署及漁農自然護理署具有現行法規規範相關危險行為，當中包括：


警務處可根據《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27（1）條，如家長或負有照顧責任的人士帶同不足16歲的兒童或少年人前往追風致其生命可能受危害，可以「疏忽照顧兒童」罪將其拘捕；
警務處可根據《警隊條例》（第232章）第63條，如追風人士拒絕聽從警務人員的指示遠離岸邊及返回安全地方，可以「阻差辦公」罪將其拘捕；
康樂及文化事務署署長可根據《泳灘規例》（第132E章）第4（1）及（2）條，封閉泳灘禁止巿民進入或使用；
康樂及文化事務署署長可根據《遊樂場地規例》（第132BC章）第4條，封閉遊樂場地禁止巿民進入或使用；以及
漁農自然護理署署長可根據《郊野公園及特別地區規例》（第208A章）第13（1）至（3）條，封閉郊野公園禁止巿民進入或使用。


在近期超強颱風樺加沙襲港期間，警方嚴厲執法，包括進行三次執法行動，共拘捕四人，相關人士在颱風期間帶同年幼子女前往海邊或高危地點追風逐浪，涉嫌觸犯《侵害人身罪條例》的「疏忽照顧兒童」罪。另外，一名男子在已封閉的屯門黃金泳灘游泳，涉嫌違反《泳灘規例》規定，警方已向法庭申請傳票檢控該名人士。警方會積極跟進其他相關個案，適時發布相關執法及行動，以表明對同類行為的「零容忍」態度。

上述提及的執法行動已清楚表明政府對這些危害生命安全和不負責任的行為予以追究責任的立場。我們亦留意到社會有意見，希望研究從法律層面針對這些在惡劣天氣下追風逐浪的不負責行為，政府會通盤考慮並作研究。

（三）從超強颱風樺加沙襲港期間，警方有效引用《侵害人身罪條例》下的「疏忽照顧兒童」罪追究攜同子女或兒童觀浪的執法例子中可見，相關法例具備實際成效。而「疏忽照顧兒童」罪的最高刑罰為監禁10年，亦具相當阻嚇力。

為進一步提升家長及兒童在惡劣天氣情況下的安全意識及自律性，教育局會透過學校課程及全方位學習活動，包括在小學人文科指導學生認識天氣警告及惡劣天氣下的應變措施，及初中地理科涵蓋暴雨和颱風下的極端天氣狀況，讓學生識別有關危險警告訊號及需採取的預防措施，以培養其面對惡劣天氣時的判斷能力與責任感，以及透過「家長電子專遞」網頁向家長發放信息，提醒家長和學生在惡劣天氣下往返學校時應注意的事宜，並按需要通知學校，請學校向家長進一步轉達有關信息。康文署則與中國香港拯溺總會每年合辦「水上安全運動」活動，宣傳「顧己及人，切勿在惡劣天氣下進行水上活動」等信息，並舉辦多個外展活動，向中、小學生推廣水上安全的重要性，有關活動今年共有超過1 500名學生參加。消防處亦於二○二四年推出「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」，透過講義和實體課堂教授防災應變、惡劣天氣應對及溺水、山嶺事故等自救知識，以提升市民應急能力與意識。該計劃已推廣至學校、社會團體及家教會等不同層面，截至今年八月三十一日，已有6 515名市民獲委任為該計劃的社區先鋒。

政府亦已善用電視宣傳短片及社交媒體平台等不同渠道，提醒市民在惡劣天氣下切勿追風逐浪，強調有關行為不僅對個人生命構成威脅，更可能違反相關法規，呼籲公眾必須保持警惕，共同維護公共安全。

政府將繼續加強執法，並從學校及社區層面入手，聯同社會各界加強相關宣傳，從源頭遏止惡劣天氣下的追風逐浪行為，以保障社會整體安全。"
LCQ18: Engaging in high-risk activities during inclement weather,2025-10-08 17:25,2025-10-08 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800537.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Nixie Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

There are views pointing out that despite the Government's repeated appeals for members of the public to stay away from dangerous areas during inclement weather, many people ignore such appeals and go storm-chasing. Such acts not only pose a serious threat to their own lives but also add to the burden of Government rescue services and deplete public emergency response resources. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the total number of cases received by the Government in the past two years where members of the public disregarded the Government's appeals and engaged in high-risk activities (such as storm-chasing, wave-watching, swimming) when inclement weather warning signals (including Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warnings, and Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals No. 3 or above) were in force, subsequently encountering danger and seeking assistance; the average cost incurred by the Hong Kong Fire Services Department and the Government Flying Service in conducting search and rescue operations for such cases;

(2) whether it will review the existing legislation to introduce clear penalties against the acts of members of the public of engaging in high-risk activities under inclement weather warnings, for example, imposing stringent penalties for going to high-risk locations (such as coastal areas, mountain creeks, and embankments) when a rainstorm warning signal is in force, so as to enhance the deterrent effect; if so, of the specific details (including timetable); if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as it has been reported that some parents still bring their children to high-risk areas during extreme weather, whether the Government will, in response to such reckless acts, further enhance the regulations concerning the care and supervision of children, including expressly defining such acts as illegal and stepping up the relevant penalties; how the Government will enhance parents' safety awareness during extreme weather through family education by means of home-school communication, community parent-child activities, etc.?

Reply:

President,

In recent years, extreme weather has become increasingly frequent. Whenever a storm approaches, the Government would remind members of the public in advance through various channels to stay vigilant and refrain from taking risks for wind-chasing and wave-watching, and repeatedly advise the public to stay away from high-risk locations. However, there are still individuals who disregard the safety of themselves and their families, and take their young children to the shorelines or other high-risk locations to chase winds and watch waves, imperiling their safety.

The Government strongly condemns wind-chasing and wave-watching behaviours during typhoons, which are selfish acts disregarding personal and public safety. Wind-chasers and wave-watchers often underestimate the risks of typhoons and rainstorms while overestimate their own ability to escape from danger. Such highly irresponsible behaviours not only endanger the safety of themselves and their children, but also place rescue personnel in extremely dangerous situations when accident occurs. These acts also unnecessarily increase the burden on public rescue services, unduly diverting resources away from those genuinely in urgent need of rescue, and thereby compromising the public interest.

In consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Education Bureau (EDB), the Environment and Ecology Bureau and the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Nixie Lam is as follows:

(1) The Fire Services Department (FSD), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), and the Government Flying Service have been deployed for mountain rescue arising from camping, hiking and immersion incidents arising from swimming or surfing activities when Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signals, or Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals No. 3 or above were in force. Details of such cases between January 1, 2023 and August 31, 2025 are as follows:

The rescue teams have not maintained statistical breakdown of their operating costs.

(2) The Government is highly concerned about and strongly condemns the acts of individuals engaging in high-risk activities during adverse weather conditions, particularly those persons who bring young children to seafronts or dangerous locations for chasing winds and watching waves. The HKPF, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) currently have regulations in place to regulate such dangerous behaviours, which include:


Section 27(1) of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212) stipulates that if any parent or individual responsible for care brings a child or young person under the age of 16 for wind-chasing or wave-watching activities in a manner that may endanger their life, such person can be arrested for the offence of ""neglect by those in charge of a child or young person"";
Section 63 of the Police Force Ordinance (Cap. 232) stipulates that if any individual refuses to comply with Police officer's order to leave the waterfront and return to safe location, such person can be arrested for the offence of ""obstructing a Police officer"";
Sections 4(1) and (2) of the Bathing Beaches Regulation (Cap. 132E) empowers the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services to close beaches, prohibiting members of the public from entering or using them;
Section 4 of the Pleasure Grounds Regulations (Cap. 132BC) empowers the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services to close pleasure grounds, prohibiting members of the public from entering or using them; and
Sections 13(1) to (3) of the Country Parks and Special Areas Regulations (Cap. 208A) empowers the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation to close country parks, prohibiting members of the public from entering or using them.


During the recent onslaught of Super Typhoon Ragasa, the HKPF took stringent enforcement actions including conducting three operations resulting in the arrest of four persons in total. These persons had brought young children to seafronts or dangerous locations for wind-chasing and wave-watching activities during adverse weather conditions, and were suspected of committing the offence of ""neglect by those in charge of a child or young person"" under the Offences against the Person Ordinance. In addition, a man was found swimming at the closed Golden Beach in Tuen Mun, suspected of contravening the Bathing Beaches Regulation. The HKPF had applied for summons to prosecute that person. The HKPF will actively follow up on relevant cases and will timely publicise enforcement actions to demonstrate the Government's zero tolerance stance towards such behaviours.

The above-mentioned enforcement actions have clearly demonstrated the Government's resolute stance on holding individuals accountable for the irresponsible acts endangering life safety. The Government has also taken note of the views in the community calling for a response, from the legislative perspective, to target the irresponsible wind-chasing and wave-watching behaviours during adverse weather conditions. The Government will take a holistic view in studying this issue.

(3) During the onslaught of Super Typhoon Ragasa, the HKPF effectively invoked the offence of ""neglect by those in charge of a child or young person"" under the Offences against the Person Ordinance to prosecute persons who brought children to wave-watching spots, demonstrating that the relevant legislation has delivered tangible results. The offence of ""neglect by those in charge of a child or young person"" carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment, which has a high deterrent effect.

To further enhance the safety awareness of parents and children during adverse weather, the EDB has integrated relevant learning into school curricula, including teaching instructions to be delivered in the Humanities curriculum in primary schools to familiarise students with various weather warning signals and relevant precautions to be taken. Additionally, the Geography curriculum of secondary schools also covers topics to introduce various extreme weather conditions, such as rainstorms and typhoons. These initiatives aim to familiarise students with various weather warning signals and the preventive measures to be taken, thereby nurturing their awareness and sense of responsibility during adverse weather conditions. The EDB would also disseminate messages to parents via its ""eBulletin for Parents"" website to remind parents and students of the matters they should pay attention to when travelling to and from school under adverse weather conditions. Where necessary, the EDB would also notify schools and request them to further convey the relevant information to parents. In addition, the LCSD and the Hong Kong China Life Saving Society jointly organise the Water Safety Campaign annually to promote messages such as ""Be considerate and refrain from engaging in water sports activities under adverse weather"". The LCSD also organises multiple outreach activities to enhance the awareness of primary and secondary students on water safety. This year, over 1 500 students participated in these activities. Concurrently, the FSD has launched the Fire Services Department Community Emergency Responder (FSDCER) Scheme in 2024. Through handouts and lectures, the public are equipped with self-rescue knowledge related to disaster preparedness, response to adverse weather conditions, drowning and mountain accidents, enhancing their emergency response capabilities and awareness. The programme has been promoted to various levels, including schools, social organisations and parent-teacher associations. As of August 31, 6 515 citizens have been appointed as FSDCER under this scheme.

The Government has also made full use of various channels, including TV Announcements in the Public Interest and social media platforms, to remind members of the public not to engage in wind-chasing and wave-watching activities during adverse weather conditions, emphasising that such acts not only endanger their personal safety but may also contravene the relevant legislation, and appealing to the public to stay vigilant and work together to safeguard public safety.

The Government will continue to step up law enforcement and collaborate with schools and community organisations to enhance publicity efforts, aiming to curb the wind-chasing and wave-watching behaviours under adverse weather conditions at source and safeguard overall public safety."
立法會七題：「盲盒」銷售模式,2025-10-08 17:20,2025-10-08 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800552.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上李浩然議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉近年一些商戶以「盲盒」（即消費者不能預先確認的商品內容）形式銷售產品的模式日趨常見，然而，該銷售模式亦引起消費者對其權益和未成年人影響的關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在現行法例及規管框架下，當局有否就「盲盒」銷售模式進行規管；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，在「盲盒」銷售模式下，消費者更傾向追求未能預先確認「盲盒」貨品內容所帶來的刺激感及僥倖心理，而非「盲盒」貨品本身，政府有否評估「盲盒」銷售模式可能存在的賭博成分，以及其對未成年人的影響為何；

（三）據悉現時一些歐洲聯盟國家、新加坡及內地等均對「盲盒」銷售實施規管，當局會否研究參照上述國家的經驗，就「盲盒」銷售模式完善現行規管框架；

（四）據悉除了線下銷售的「盲盒」，消費者亦可以透過網上平台購買境外銷售的「盲盒」，當局有否評估現行條例及規管是否足夠防範境外銷售的「盲盒」可能涉及的避稅和違禁物等風險；及

（五）鑑於國家市場監督管理總局於二○二三年六月發布《盲盒經營行為規範指引（試行）》，當中特別制訂負面銷售清單，限制部分商品例如藥品、醫療器械及易燃易爆物品等不得以「盲盒」形式銷售，同時亦對化妝品和食品等關係到市民大眾健康的產品作出限定性表述，政府會否考慮相關做法，對關乎市民健康安全的商品的銷售手法進行規管？

答覆：

主席：

就問題的各部分，經諮詢民政及青年事務局、醫務衞生局、環境及生態局、保安局、財經事務及庫務局及香港海關（海關）後，現綜合回覆如下。

政府一直致力保障消費者權益，並十分重視在市面上銷售的產品的安全。就近年流行的「盲盒」，我們留意到有其他司法管轄區，包括內地，就相關銷售模式和產品安全性等作出規管。

香港現時有不同的法例保障消費者權益。其中，《商品說明條例》（第362章）禁止商戶對消費者作出不良營商手法，包括虛假商品說明、誤導性遺漏、具威嚇性的營業行為、餌誘式廣告宣傳、先誘後轉銷售行為及不當地接受付款。《商品說明條例》涵蓋貨品及服務，對實體及網上商戶的營業行為同樣適用。商戶如向消費者銷售「盲盒」時涉及上述不良營商手法，即屬違法。

海關是《商品說明條例》的主要執法機關，一直積極透過執法行動、合規推廣及推行宣傳教育，打擊不良營商手法，保障消費者權益。如發現有商戶涉嫌作出不良營商手法，海關會果斷執法。另一方面，消費者委員會（消委會）致力研究和倡導維護消費者權益的工作，包括處理消費者就貨品及服務作出的投訴。如消費者懷疑有商戶在銷售「盲盒」時，涉及不良營商手法，可向海關作出舉報或向消委會投訴。

此外，香港現時有不同的法例規管各類產品或物品的安全。任何人士向消費者提供相關產品或物品時，不論以任何形式、包裝和渠道銷售，均有責任確保其安全性符合相關法例要求。

就玩具產品方面，《玩具及兒童產品安全條例》（第424章）對製造、進口或供應本港使用的玩具的安全作出規管。《玩具及兒童產品安全（附加安全標準或規定）規例》亦訂明在本港供應的玩具，必須附有識別標記（即製造商、進口商或供應商的名稱和地址）及適用於該玩具的雙語警示或警告（即其安全存放、使用、耗用或處置的任何警示或警告）等資料。

就藥物（包括藥劑製品及中成藥）方面，現行法規旨在確保藥物的安全、品質及成效符合相關標準，以保障市民健康及安全。它們必須按《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章）或《中醫藥條例》（第549章）註冊方可銷售，而所有註冊藥劑製品及中成藥必須於外盒包裝印有或附上與註冊詳情相符的標籤，清楚列明香港註冊編號、產品名稱、有效成分、製造商資料等。以「盲盒」形式銷售藥物可能違反相關法例。市民在選購藥物時，應詳細閲讀藥物包裝的標籤內容，切勿購買或使用成分或來歷不明的藥物。

就醫療器械方面，視乎有關產品的特性和特點，一些產品已受現行法例規管，包括《藥劑業及毒藥條例》、《消費品安全條例》（第456章）和《商品說明條例》等。市民在購買及使用醫療器械前，亦應充分了解產品，確保產品符合自身情況。政府正積極發展香港成為國際醫療創新樞紐，將於二○二六年內成立「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」，分階段實施「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制，並會提交規管醫療器械的立法建議，完善藥械監管法規。

就危險品方面，《危險品條例》（第295章）及其附屬法例規管危險品（包括爆炸品及易燃物品）的製造、貯存、運送及使用。商戶如以「盲盒」形式向消費者提供上述法例下所規管的危險品，必須遵守上述法例的規定。若「盲盒」內的物品為日常生活常使用及在零售商店常見的危險品（例如酒精搓手液、膠水等），而其盛載的容量不超過《2012年危險品（適用及豁免）規例》列出的最大包裝容量，則屬消費裝危險品，其包裝、標記及標籤等要求可獲豁免。

就食品方面，根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章），所有在香港出售的食物必須適宜供人食用。它們亦須符合上述法例下有關食物安全及食安標準的附屬法例。其中，根據《食物及藥物（成分組合及標籤）規例》，任何人在香港出售預先包裝食物，無論是否用「盲盒」形式出售，除非獲得豁免，否則所有預先包裝食物所加上的標記或標籤須以中文或英文，或中英文兼用，列出各項資料，包括保質期、特別貯存方式或使用指示的陳述、能量值及營養素含量等。

此外，在香港供應予私人使用的消費品，如不受其他法例規管，其產品安全受《消費品安全條例》及其附屬法例《消費品安全規例》規管。《消費品安全條例》規定製造商、進口商及供應商須確保其供應的消費品合符合理的安全程度；而《消費品安全規例》規定就消費品的包裝或標籤上的警示或警告，須以中文及英文表達，並且必須清楚可讀。

政府會繼續密切留意不良營商手法的趨勢和各類物品的相關安全標準的最新要求，從而制訂適切的應對策略，保障消費者的權益和安全。

另外，香港現時就禁運／受管制物品的進出口和應課稅品均有嚴格規管。相關規管適用於所有進出口模式，包括透過跨境電子商貿平台購入的物品。根據《進出口條例》（第60章），所有受管制物品（包括危險藥物、槍械、彈藥、武器、受管制化學品、藥品和動植物等）必須先獲得有關當局簽發的有效牌照或許可證，方能進出口。若沒有有效牌照或許可證而把任何受管制物品帶進／帶出香港（無論自攜、郵寄或經代購集運），除了涉案的物品會被充公，違例者也可遭檢控。在稅項方面，除了四類應課稅品（即酒類、煙草、碳氫油類及甲醇）須根據《應課稅品條例》（第109章）繳稅外，香港對其他進出口貨品不設任何關稅。任何人士如欲進出口應課稅品必須向海關申領有效許可證和作出申報。如欲在香港使用上述應課稅品，必須確保有關物品已完稅。"
"LCQ7: Sales model of ""blind boxes""",2025-10-08 17:20,2025-10-08 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800551.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 It is learnt that in recent years, the sale of products in the form of ""blind boxes"" (i.e. commodities whose contents are unidentifiable by consumers in advance) has become increasingly common among some merchants. However, such sales model has also aroused consumers' concerns about their rights and interests as well as its impact on minors. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the authorities have regulated the sales model of ""blind boxes"" under the current legal and regulatory framework;

(2) as there are views that under the sales model of ""blind boxes"", consumers are more inclined to pursue the thrill and chance-taking mentality from not being able to identify the contents of the ""blind box"" items in advance rather than the items themselves, whether the Government has assessed the gambling elements that may be inherent in the sales model of ""blind boxes"" and its impact on minors;

(3) it is learnt that some European Union countries, Singapore and the Mainland have imposed regulation on the sale of ""blind boxes"", whether the authorities will consider drawing on the experience of the aforesaid countries to improve the current regulatory framework for the sales model of ""blind boxes"";

(4) it is learnt that in addition to ""blind boxes"" available for sale offline, consumers can also purchase ""blind boxes"" sold outside Hong Kong through online platforms, whether the authorities have assessed if the existing legislation and regulation are sufficient to guard against such risks relating to tax avoidance and prohibited articles that may be associated with ""blind boxes"" sold outside Hong Kong; and

(5) as the State Administration for Market Regulation issued the Guidelines on Rules for Blind Box Business Operations (for Trial Implementation) in June 2023, which include a specific negative sales list prohibiting the sale of certain commodities such as medicinal products, medical devices as well as flammables and explosives in the form of ""blind boxes"", while also imposing restrictions on products such as cosmetics and food that have a bearing on public health, whether the Government will consider drawing on such practice to regulate the sales practice of commodities relating to public health and safety?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Home Affairs and Youth Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Security Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), our consolidated reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

 The Government has been committed to safeguarding the rights and interests of consumers, and attaches great importance to the safety of products sold in the market. Regarding ""blind boxes"" which have gained popularity in recent years, we note that other jurisdictions, including the Mainland, have been regulating, among others, relevant sales practices and product safety.

 Currently, various laws are in place in Hong Kong to protect the rights and interests of consumers. Among others, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap. 362) prohibits traders from subjecting consumers to unfair trade practices, including false trade descriptions, misleading omissions, aggressive commercial practices, bait advertising, bait-and-switch and wrongly accepting payment. The Trade Descriptions Ordinance covers goods and services, and is applicable to the trade practices of both physical and online traders. A trader deploying any of the above unfair trade practices when selling ""blind boxes"" to consumers will contravene the law.

 The C&ED, as the principal enforcement agency of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, has been actively combating unfair trade practices through enforcement actions, compliance promotion, and publicity and public education, with a view to protecting consumer rights and interests. If a trader is suspected of having engaged in unfair trade practices, the C&ED will take enforcement actions decisively. On the other hand, the Consumer Council endeavours to study and promote the protection of consumers' rights and interests, including handling consumer complaints concerning goods and services. If consumers suspect that a trader is engaging in unfair trade practices when selling ""blind boxes"", they could report the matter to the C&ED or file a complaint with the Council.

 In addition, at present, various laws in Hong Kong regulate the safety of different types of products or articles. Any person supplying relevant products or articles to consumers, regardless of the form, packaging and sales channel, is responsible for ensuring that their safety complies with the relevant legal requirements.

 In respect of toys products, the Toys and Children's Products Safety Ordinance (Cap. 424) regulates the safety of toys, which are manufactured, imported or supplied for local use. The Toys and Children's Products Safety (Additional Safety Standards or Requirements) Regulation also stipulates that a toy supplied in Hong Kong must carry information including identification markings (i.e. the full name and address of the manufacturer, importer or supplier) and the bilingual warnings or cautions (with respect to the safe keeping, use, consumption or disposal) applicable to the toy.

 For drugs (including pharmaceutical products and proprietary Chinese medicines (pCms)), the current regulations aim to ensure that drugs meet relevant standards for safety, quality and efficacy, thereby safeguarding public health and safety. They must be registered under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138) (PPO) or the Chinese Medicine Ordinance (Cap. 549) before they can be sold. All registered pharmaceutical products and pCms must bear labels that correspond to the registration particulars, clearly stating information such as the Hong Kong registration number, product name, active ingredients, manufacturer information, etc. Selling drugs in the form of ""blind boxes"" may violate relevant legislation. When purchasing drugs, members of the public should carefully read the information on the packaging labels, and should not buy or use products of doubtful composition or from unknown sources.

 As regards medical devices, some products are already regulated by existing legislation, including the PPO, the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance (Cap. 456) and the Trade Descriptions Ordinance etc, depending on the characteristics and features of the products concerned. Before purchasing and using medical devices, members of the public should also thoroughly familiarise themselves with the product to ensure it meets their needs. The Government is actively developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub, and will set up the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation in 2026, implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases and submit a legislative proposal on regulating medical devices, to enhance medical products regulation.

 As regards dangerous goods, the Dangerous Goods Ordinance (Cap. 295) and its subsidiary legislation regulate the manufacture, storage, conveyance and use of dangerous goods (including explosives and inflammable substances). A trader supplying any dangerous goods regulated under the above legislation in the form of ""blind boxes"" must comply with the legal requirements. If the articles inside the ""blind boxes"" are commonly used in daily life and available in retail stores (such as alcohol handrub/sanitiser, glue, etc), and the container sizes of which do not exceed the maximum package size specified in the Dangerous Goods (Application and Exemption) Regulation 2012, they are classified as dangerous goods in consumer packs, and will be exempted from the packing, marking and labelling requirements.

 As regards food, according to the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), all food sold in Hong Kong shall be safe for human consumption. It must also comply with the subsidiary legislation under the aforementioned ordinance concerning food safety and food safety standards. Specifically, according to the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations, unless exempted, the labelling or marking of the prepackaged food for sale in Hong Kong, whether in the form of ""blind boxes"" or not, must include relevant information, including indication of durability, statement of special conditions for storage or instructions for use, information on energy value and nutrient content, etc, in either the English or the Chinese language or in both languages.

 Moreover, the safety of consumer goods which are ordinarily supplied for private use in Hong Kong, if not covered by other legislation, is subject to the regulation of the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation, the Consumer Goods Safety Regulation. Pursuant to the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance, manufacturers, importers and suppliers should ensure that the consumer goods they supply are reasonably safe. The Consumer Goods Safety Regulation stipulates that any warning or caution marked on the package of consumer goods must be in both the English and the Chinese languages in a legible and conspicuous manner.

 The Government will continue to closely monitor the trends of unfair trade practices and the latest requirements for safety standards of various articles to formulate appropriate strategies, thereby protecting consumers' rights and interests and safety.

 Furthermore, there are strict regulations in Hong Kong on the import and export of all prohibited/controlled items and dutiable commodities. These regulations are applicable to all modes of import and export, including articles purchased through cross-border electronic commerce platforms. According to the Import and Export Ordinance (Cap. 60), import and export of all controlled items (including dangerous drugs, arms, ammunition, weapons, controlled chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and animals and plants, etc) must be accompanied by a valid licence or permit issued by the relevant authorities. Any person who brings any controlled item into/out of Hong Kong (whether by person, by post, or through purchasing agents or consolidated consignments) without a valid licence or permit may be prosecuted, in addition to confiscation of the subject item. In terms of tax, apart from four categories of dutiable commodities that are subject to duty under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (Cap. 109) (i.e. liquor, tobacco, hydrocarbon and methyl alcohol), Hong Kong does not impose duty on any other imported or exported goods. Any person who imports or exports dutiable goods must obtain a valid permit from the C&ED and make proper declaration on the manifest. For consumption of dutiable goods in Hong Kong, one must ensure that the relevant duty has been duly paid."
Monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes continues to drop in September,2025-10-08 17:00,2025-10-08 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800465.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (October 8) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index (MGI) for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in September was 2.5 per cent, lower than the 5.3 per cent in August. This reflects the continued efforts by relevant government departments to intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations, resulting in the improvement of the overall mosquito infestation situation this month. In addition, the FEHD has strengthened the dissemination of information on the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes so that more citizens can quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation. The department will continue its mosquito control work to further reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

  In September, all 64 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index (AGI) lower than the alert level of 20 per cent. The decreases in the MGI and the AGI are attributable to the continuous and intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations by various government departments and stakeholders, and may also have been affected by factors such as weather. The monthly rainfall was 528.7 millimetres in September, showing a decrease from the 939.2mm in August and 601.7mm in July. Overall, the MGI for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in September was 2.5 per cent, at Level 1 (indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was not extensive). Relevant departments and stakeholders will persistently intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations.

  Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in September was 1.1, which represented that an average of 1.1 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas.

  The FEHD currently makes regular announcements on gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD has strengthened information dissemination by promptly announcing the latest gravidtrap indexes through press releases and social media.

  In addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of CF, the FEHD has extended the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI falling between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks and, in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together to take mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

  To reduce the risk of transmission of CF and DF, the FEHD continues to step up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts and to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within a 250 metre radius of the residence of patients and the places patients had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

  The FEHD continues to conduct its three-phase Anti-mosquito Campaign this year. The third phase of the territory-wide campaign was launched on August 4 and will run until October 24. During the period, the district offices of the FEHD will target areas that have drawn particular concern, such as public markets, cooked food centres and hawker bazaars, single-block buildings, streets and back lanes, common parts of buildings, village houses, construction sites, vacant sites and road works sites to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work. To further enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control, the FEHD and relevant government departments have carried out phase two of the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations from May 7. In addition to the work of phase one, including eliminating potential mosquito breeding places, the FEHD called on property management entities to arrange for necessary repairs to their premises to minimise mosquito breeding places and commence adult mosquito control measures by means of regular ultra-low volume fogging operations.

  The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  Aedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit DF and CF. DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. Additionally, according to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of August, over 317 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. The DF and CF activities in neighbouring areas have remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."

​立法會：政務司司長就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節）致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-08 17:00,2025-10-08 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800603.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上就《行政長官2025年施政報告》致謝議案辯論（第一節：深化改革心繫民生、「一國兩制」行穩致遠、強化治理體系和粵港澳大灣區建設）的致辭全文︰

主席：

我衷心感謝李慧琼議員提出的致謝議案，以及多位議員在第一節辯論中提出的寶貴意見。

行政長官早前發表二○二五年《施政報告》，以「深化改革心繫民生發揮優勢同創未來」為主題，在今年作為國家「十四五」規劃收官之年，以及「十五五」規劃謀篇布局之年，提出多項政策措施，引領香港更主動對接國家發展戰略、進一步鞏固香港的競爭力、發展經濟、改善民生，帶領社會改革創新。

剛才議員圍繞「深化改革心繫民生」、「一國兩制」行穩致遠、強化治理體系，以及粵港澳大灣區建設這四個重要議題提出很多很有用的見解。我會先作整體回應，然後各司局長會就其所屬政策範疇作進一步說明。

「一國兩制」行穩致遠

我們會繼續全面準確、堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」、「港人治港」、高度自治的方針，充分發揮「一國兩制」制度優勢，保持香港長期繁榮穩定。

特區政府已在二○二一年完善選舉制度、二○二三年完善地區治理體系及重塑區議會，全面落實「愛國者治港」原則。我們會全力籌辦好今年十二月七日舉行的第八屆立法會選舉，確保選舉公平、公正、誠實和安全有序進行。我們會確保特區的管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中。

特區政府致力構建以愛國愛港為核心、與「一國兩制」方針相適應的主流價值觀。由我擔任主席的「憲法和基本法推廣督導委員會」，已於去年成立轄下的「愛國主義教育工作小組」，以協調政府部門及非政府機構推動愛國主義教育。工作小組認為愛國主義教育是關乎人心、需要深耕細作的工作，應以軟性和打動人心的方式進行。工作小組按香港的實際情況訂下短、中、長期的工作目標和政策措施。今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，我們的重點是做好抗戰勝利80周年紀念活動。

特區政府舉辦多項紀念和教育活動，得到市民和青少年廣泛參與，有效宣揚銘記歷史、珍愛和平的主題。我們會繼續梳理及修繕保護全港各區的中共抗戰遺址，推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施，並將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地。我們深切明白到愛國主義教育的工作關係到國家安全以及特區的長治久安，因此我們必定會竭盡所能，以更多創新思維，持之以恆，久久為功，在特區全方位推廣愛國主義教育。

維護國家主權、安全、發展利益是「一國兩制」方針的最高原則。《香港國安法》實施五年來，香港從「由亂到治」邁向「由治及興」。特區政府會繼續堅定不移維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，深入踐行「總體國家安全觀」，居安思危，防範風險，確保香港長治久安。我們會加強《憲法》和《基本法》的宣傳教育，加強市民對《憲法》、《基本法》、國家安全，以及「一國兩制」的認識，持續完善維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制，並以多管齊下的策略，推展國家安全相關宣傳教育，將國安信息進一步植根社區。

中華優秀傳統文化是我們的優勢，是維繫國家、民族團結的重要根基。教育局持續透過優化課程、為學生舉辦多元化的全方位學習活動等，增進學生對國家的認識，並以中華文化作為價值觀教育的主軸，進一步加強學生的國民身分認同和文化自信。

教育局將持續支援學校，將愛國主義教育融入日常學與教之中，厚植學生家國情懷，同時繼續凝聚社會各界的資源和力量，並善用內地和本地愛國主義教育設施，讓學生更深入了解國家的歷史文化和成就。

強化治理體系

本屆政府上任以來，持續強化治理體系，致力提升執行效率和服務質素。早前超強颱風樺加沙襲港，由行政長官指導和由我統籌的應對極端天氣督導委員會，發揮頂層領導作用，在充分準備及全方位部署下，迅速統籌協調各相關部門，全力減低對市民的影響。各部門嚴陣以待，整個應對過程展現高效協作與專業能力。

早前有議員提到公務員存有「不做不錯」的心態，我對此並不認同。無論是應對超強颱風樺加沙，或是上個月處理鰂魚涌一枚重達一千磅的戰時炸彈，部門同事均是緊守崗位、全力以赴，大量人員更是通宵達旦工作，充分展現責任感、使命感，以及主動多走一步的專業精神。不同部門同事無分你我，緊密協作，更確保資源的精準投放，以及應變行動的流暢執行。

事實上，本屆政府自上任以來不斷推行改革，建立「以結果為目標」的政府和公務員團隊。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》中，香港在「政府效率」排名世界第二，不但反映香港公務員整體是一支優秀隊伍，亦反映本屆政府的改革和公務員共同努力的成果。

今年《施政報告》就進一步強化治理，提出建立部門首長責任制及強化公務員評核機制。這並非因為不滿公務員整體表現，其目的是要把公務員的管理，變得更為制度化、系統化、公平化。責任制強調部門首長須負責管理好部門團隊，發揮最大效能；同時樹立固定機制，當部門出現問題時，可按問題輕重，作出調整和糾正。

我們亦會強化公務員評核機制，鼓勵優秀公務員精益求精、提振士氣；同時要求管理方針對性地協助有不足的員工提升能力，並妥善處理個別長期表現欠佳的情況，以確保整體服務水平不斷提升。

此外，為進一步提升政府效能，政府將成立AI效能提升組，由政務司副司長領導相關政策局並邀請業界代表參與，推動政府部門有效應用AI人工智能技術。小組將統籌指導各部門應用AI、研究重組工作流程，以及推動科技革新以提效提質。

粵港澳大灣區建設

香港是粵港澳大灣區中心城市和區域發展核心引擎之一，在大灣區建設中肩負引領帶動的重任，在國家進一步改革開放中更具有不可替代的重要作用。特區政府會繼續帶領全社會更主動對接國家戰略、更積極融入國家發展大局，加強與廣東、澳門的互利合作，提升人流、物流、數據流、資金流，促進協同發展。

為深化大灣區內的規則銜接和機制對接，律政司將繼續推動訂立大灣區仲裁員名冊、設立大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，減低解決跨境爭議的成本，並支持大灣區律師的專業發展，組建大灣區律師聯會，設立法律資訊平台，同時加強推廣香港法律及其他專業服務，支援企業出海需要。

總結

今年的《施政報告》既立足當前，更謀劃長遠。在香港加快邁向「由治及興」的進程上，我們繼續背靠祖國強大後盾，堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」方針，善用粵港澳大灣區的優勢，同時進一步強化治理，發揮香港擁有獨一無二的優勢，讓香港的發展方向更清晰，道路更廣闊，市民有更多的幸福感和獲得感。

我們期待在接着的環節聽到議員更多意見。主席，我謹此陳辭。"
九月份白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數持續回落,2025-10-08 17:00,2025-10-08 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800463.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（十月八日）公布，九月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之二點五，較八月份的百分之五點三為低，反映相關政府部門持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，令本月的整體蚊患情況較上月有所改善。此外，食環署已加強白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數的資訊發放，讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，並會繼續進行控蚊工作，進一步降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱傳播風險。

九月份，全部64個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平。九月份每月誘蚊器指數及分區誘蚊器指數的回落，是由於各政府部門及持份者持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，亦有機會受天氣等因素影響。九月份的總雨量為528.7毫米，較八月份的939.2毫米及七月份的601.7毫米下降。整體而言，九月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之二點五，屬於一級水平（顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布並不廣泛），各相關部門及持份者仍會持續進行控蚊工作。

另外，九月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點一，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一點一隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署已加強資訊發放，並通過新聞公報及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

為降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險，食環署繼續在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，並在病者的住所及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署今年繼續分三期進行全港滅蚊運動，第三期滅蚊運動已於八月四日展開，至十月二十四日止。其間，食環署各分區辦事處會針對區內一些受關注的地點，例如公眾街巿、熟食中心、小販巿場、單幢式樓宇、街道和後巷、大廈的公用地方、村屋、建築地盤、空置土地及路旁工地等，進行一連串的清除積水及防治蚊患行動。為進一步加強滅蚊的成效，食環署已聯同相關部門，於五月七日起展開第二期全城防蚊及滅蚊行動，除繼續第一期工作，包括清除潛在蚊子滋生地外，食環署呼籲私人物業管理公司及早維修處所，以減少蚊子滋生地，並開始定期以超低微量噴灑方式殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境以徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。此外，根據世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至八月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過317 000千宗個案。鄰近地區登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"

Speech by SFST at Raffles Family Office Annual Forum 2025 (English only),2025-10-08 16:23,2025-10-08 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800526.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Raffles Family Office Annual Forum 2025 today (October 8):

Chi Man (Group Chief Executive Officer of Raffles Family Office, Mr Kwan Chi Man), Minister Murangwa (Minister of Finance and Economic Planning of the Republic of Rwanda, Mr Yusuf Murangwa), ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,

 It is a profound honour to address you at the Raffles Family Office Annual Forum 2025. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the organiser for convening this distinguished gathering.

 The theme of this year's forum, ""The Decade Before, A Century Beyond,"" resonates deeply with the evolving mission of family offices: to preserve wealth, foster values, and also drive positive impact across generations.

  Family offices are undergoing significant transformation, and I wish to share with you a few defining trends that we observed. Firstly, family offices are enhancing governance structures and also investment processes, formalising investment opportunities, adopting institutional-style governance to ensure efficiency and also clarity in decision-making, often separating operations from family offices.

  Secondly, there is a growing focus on private markets, with family offices increasingly allocating capital to private equity, co-investments, and also direct investments in companies, moving away from purely passive public market investments and adopting fund structures to centralise asset management, achieve scale, and also facilitate succession planning.

  And thirdly, driven by collaboration, especially at a global level, family mobility and diverse investment opportunities, family offices are expanding globally and also enhancing services with custom solutions, such as estate planning, insurance, technology adoption, and also collaboration with banks, insurers and wealth tax, to meet these evolving needs.

  All these three trends that I mentioned, professional governance, diversification into private assets and also global operations sophistication, position family offices well to thrive in an era of rapid technological disruption, evolving economic paradigms, and also growing societal expectations. Hong Kong, as a global financial hub, is uniquely positioned to support this journey, offering a platform where bold ideas can flourish and also legacies can endure for generations to come.

 The Government is steadfast in our commitment to positioning our city as the premier hub for family offices in Asia and beyond. Our unique advantages - a robust legal system, world-class financial infrastructure, strategic proximity to the Mainland, and a competitive and simple tax regime - make us an ideal destination for family offices, including those from Africa of course, seeking to establish or expand their operations. Through a multipronged approach, in collaboration with regulators and our industry stakeholders, we have implemented a comprehensive suite of policies to create a conducive and also competitive environment for global family offices.

 A key pillar of our strategy is the profits tax exemption for family-owned investment holding vehicles managed by single family offices here in Hong Kong. This measure reduces the cost of operating here, enabling families to optimise their wealth management strategies and also focus on long-term growth and also legacy building. By alleviating tax constraints, we empower family offices to allocate resources strategically, aligning with their goals of intergenerational wealth preservation and also impact. We will also be expanding the qualifying investments for tax concessions to include private credit and other new asset classes, aligning with the new trend of sector I just highlighted.

 Recognising the crucial role of talent and expertise, as highlighted by Chi Man just now, we established the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy two years ago under the Financial Services Development Council. This academy serves as a collaborative platform to network, share knowledge, and also to train specialised talent to family offices, asset owners, and wealth inheritors. The academy has recently celebrated its second anniversary and has delivered over 20 capacity-building events in collaboration with partners and thought leaders, engaging over 3 000 family asset owners and next-gen leaders in dialogues and also legacy planning. By fostering positive financial management values and also strengthening the talent pool, the academy supports the professionalisation of the sector, ensuring family offices have access to the expertise needed to thrive in a competitive landscape.

  Another initiative that I would highlight is our New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (new CIES) further enriches our ecosystem by attracting high-net-worth individuals and their capital to Hong Kong. Eligible investors who make investments of HK$27 million or above in eligible assets and place HK$3 million into the new CIES Investment Portfolio, as managed by Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, may reside and pursue development in Hong Kong. Recent enhancements demonstrate our responsiveness; from March this year, investments through wholly owned private companies counted towards the threshold, and net asset assessment and calculation requirements have also been relaxed. Moreover, the threshold of the transaction price of residential real estate is now reduced, while the aggregate cap for the total investment amount in real estate is also raised. These measures create synergies with our tax concession regime, encouraging more family offices to anchor in Hong Kong and contribute to our vibrant financial ecosystem.

 Beyond fiscal and operational support, we are fostering Hong Kong as a global centre for philanthropy and cultural innovation. Initiatives include developing art storage facilities at our airport, which cater to the growing interest in luxury assets among family offices. In additional, we are promoting Hong Kong as a philanthropic hub, aligning with the aspirations of many family offices to drive positive social impact. These efforts resonate with the forum's theme of building legacies that extend beyond financial wealth, contributing to a better future for communities worldwide.

 Our policies have delivered tangible results. We set a target to facilitate at least 200 family offices to establish or expand operations in Hong Kong by the end of 2025 - a goal we proudly achieved ahead of schedule in September this year. As announced in the latest Policy Address, we target to attract an additional 220 family offices to Hong Kong from the year of 2026 to the year of 2028, further enriching our market size.

 Finally, the third Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit, our flagship event for family offices, was held in March this year under the theme ""Hong Kong of the World, for the World"". It convened family offices to discuss technology, artificial intelligence, philanthropy, and also cultural innovation, fostering collaborations to create a sustainable future. This summit underscores Hong Kong's role as a convener of global ideas and a catalyst for positive change, aligning with the aspirations of family offices to create a lasting impact. I am very glad to share that it will return once again next year.

 Before I go, I would like to congratulate Chi Man for organising this event, and also choosing the right colour for the forum because it is in the same colour of the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address. At the same time, as Chinese say, it takes 10 years to grow a tree but a hundred years to cultivate a talent, so I am sure it is just the start of a new journey and the use of a tree pattern here is very apt.

 Again, the Raffles Family Office Annual Forum 2025 embodies the spirit of ""The Decade Before, A Century Beyond."" It challenges us to learn from the past, engage with the present, and build a future where family offices thrive as stewards of wealth and values. Hong Kong invites you to leverage our unparalleled advantages - robust policies, strategic location, and a dynamic financial ecosystem - to establish or expand your operations. Our comprehensive support, from tax exemptions to talent development, positions Hong Kong as the premier destination for family offices seeking to build legacies that endure. Together, let us weave the tapestry of the future, drawing from the lessons of the past decade to create a century of prosperity, impact, and responsibility.

 Thank you."
LCQ8: Prevention of herpes zoster,2025-10-08 16:15,2025-10-08 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800496.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Benson Luk and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  It is learnt that there are at present over 80 recognised autoimmune disorders, with as many as 30 000 patients in Hong Kong suffering from such disorders who are at greater risk of contracting herpes zoster (HZ) (commonly known as ""shingles"") than average persons. While various forms of HZ vaccination plans (commonly known as ""shingles vaccine"") are available at various prices in the private healthcare market, the charges are considerable, with ordinary medical groups charging no less than HK$5,000. Yet the vaccine provides effective protection for only 10 years and revaccination is necessary afterwards. Ordinary grass roots may not be able to afford the expenses. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that HZ vaccine is currently not included in the Government Vaccination Programme, and that in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on November 20 last year, the Government indicated that the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases considered that more local data from a cost-benefit analysis would be required for future consideration on whether to include HZ vaccine in the Government Vaccination Programme, whether relevant reviews have been conducted by the authorities; if so, of the details and the outcomes of the latest review; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it is learnt that it is more difficult for patients with autoimmune disorders than average persons to ascertain whether they have HZ because they may often experience unknown pain, redness and various inflammations, and as a result these patients have to spend considerable time and expenses to identify the cause of their ailments, whether the authorities have formulated any established mechanism to assist such patients in early detection and treatment of HZ; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) in the long term, whether the SAR Government will consider including HZ vaccine in its Vaccination Programme when its public financial resources return to a sufficient level, so that grass-roots patients with autoimmune disorders or other high-risk individuals can receive subsidised vaccination services?

Reply:

President,

  Herpes Zoster (also known as Shingles) is caused by varicella-zoster virus, which is also responsible for Chickenpox. The virus remains latent in the nervous system of patients recovered from Chickenpox and may reactivate in times of weakened immune system many years later, inducing Herpes Zoster. Therefore, Herpes Zoster is not a disease caused by acute infection. Patients would develop painful, belt-like skin rash with blisters. Herpes Zoster is not serious in general and the risk of serious complications or death is not high. Early treatment with antiviral medications can speed up the healing of blisters; reduce the symptoms and the risk of complications.

  One of the preventive measures against Herpes Zoster is to receive Herpes Zoster vaccine. Currently, there is one Herpes Zoster vaccine registered in Hong Kong. According to international literature available so far, the effective protection period of Herpes Zoster vaccines is around ten years generally.

  The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) under the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) regularly reviews the epidemiological situation of local vaccine-preventable diseases, the latest recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), scientific developments and evidence on vaccines, updates on vaccine components, cost-effectiveness studies, as well as actual experiences of other health authorities, and provides relevant vaccination recommendations to the DH from a public health perspective. The Government will make reference to the recommendations of the SCVPD and carefully consider various factors, including the overall medical burden of a disease on the community, vaccine availability, cost-effectiveness of large-scale vaccination, public acceptability, and other public health factors, in formulating various government subsidised immunisation programmes.

  For vaccines not included in the government's subsidised immunisation programmes, individuals can consult their family doctor for professional advice to understand the benefits, risks and necessity of vaccination. Based on the doctor's assessment of health status, medical history, and other factors, individuals can make informed decisions on whether to proceed with vaccination under informed consent.

  In response to the Hon Benson Luk's question, Health Bureau's reply after consultation with the DH and the Hospital Authority is as follows:

(1) and (3) The SCVPD discussed the topic of Herpes Zoster vaccines in September 2023. It considered that more local data from a cost-benefit analysis perspective would be essential for future consideration on the inclusion of Herpes Zoster vaccine into the government's vaccination programme. The SCVPD was of the view that Herpes Zoster vaccines available in Hong Kong were safe and effective. Individual older adults and adults with immunocompromised conditions may consider receiving Herpes Zoster vaccine after consulting their doctors to protect themselves against Herpes Zoster and its complications.

  The Health Bureau has commissioned The University of Hong Kong to conduct an analysis on the cost-benefit of the Herpes Zoster vaccine. Upon completion of the cost-benefit analysis, the SCVPD is expected to discuss the vaccination for Herpes Zoster based on the relevant analysis results in 2026.

  The Government will continue to closely monitor relevant factors, including the latest recommendations of the WHO, the views of the SCVPD, the development and change in costs of vaccines, and the overall medical burden of the disease to consider whether to implement a government-subsidised Herpes Zoster vaccination programme. The subsidy level targeting different groups will also need to be considered if it is necessary to implement the programme.

  Moreover, at the primary healthcare level, family doctors and primary healthcare professionals will closely collaborate to provide information and education on vaccinations (including Herpes Zoster vaccine), to enhance public awareness of the Herpes Zoster vaccine and preventive consciousness.

(2) As mentioned above, Herpes Zoster is not serious in general and the risk of serious complications or death is not high. 

  Patients with Herpes Zoster first experience itch or slight pain with burning sensation in the affected area, with rash appearing one to three days later. The rash then develops into blisters, which further spread in a belt-like pattern and can last from one to 14 days, during which pustules or trickle of blood may appear. This will be followed by bursting, collapse and drying up of the fluid-filled blisters and crusting over two to three weeks. Antiviral drug can shorten the recovery time of Herpes Zoster patients and it is optimal to take it within three to five days of the onset of the disease.

  The Government encourages the public, especially immunocompromised individuals to remain vigilant. Members of the public, who experience symptoms, should seek medical advice early and take medications according to doctors' instructions. At the same time, the Government is committed to enhancing district-based primary healthcare services to shift the emphasis of the present healthcare system and mindset from treatment-oriented to prevention-oriented. Initiatives include promoting the Life Course Preventive Care Plan through District Health Centres to formulate personalised health management plans that address the health needs of citizens across different life stages, based on personal factors such as their gender, age and family history. The Government provides chronic disease and cancer screening, as well as advice and education on healthy lifestyle through family doctors and primary healthcare professionals, with a view to improving the overall health conditions of the citizens. The Government also takes this opportunity to remind the public that maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help strengthen immunity and prevent Herpes Zoster."
立法會八題：預防帶狀疱疹,2025-10-08 16:15,2025-10-08 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800495.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上陸瀚民議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉現時已確認的自身免疫力系統失調病症約有80多種，而香港患有相關病症的病人人數高達三萬；此類病人較平常人更大機會感染帶狀疱疹（俗稱「生蛇」）。雖然私營醫療市場有提供各種形式及價格的帶狀疱疹疫苗注射計劃（俗稱「蛇針」），惟收費不菲，一般醫療集團的收費不少於5,000港元，但該疫苗的有效保護期為10年，市民其後仍需再次接種，一般基層市民未必能應付相關開支。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於現時政府的防疫注射計劃並不包括帶狀疱疹疫苗，而政府於去年十一月二十日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，疫苗可預防疫病科學委員會認為需要更多有關成本效益分析的本地數據，方得以考慮未來應否把帶狀疱疹疫苗納入政府的防疫注射計劃，當局有否進行相關檢視；如有，詳情和最新的檢視結果分別為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）據悉由於患有自身免疫力系統失調的病人在日常生活中都可能出現不明疼痛、紅腫及各種炎症，因此較一般人更難確定他們是否患上帶狀疱疹，令該等病人花費很長時間及成本方可確定其病因，當局有否制訂既定機制，協助該等病人及早發現和治療帶狀疱疹；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）長遠而言，當特區政府的公共財政資源回復充裕時，當局會否考慮在其防疫注射計劃下，增加帶狀疱疹疫苗注射項目，讓患有自身免疫力系統失調的基層病人或其他高危人士可接受獲資助的疫苗注射服務？

答覆：

主席︰

帶狀疱疹（俗稱「生蛇」）是由引起水痘的水痘帶狀疱疹病毒引致。病毒於水痘患者痊癒後潛藏在體內的神經系統。多年後當身體免疫力下降，有機會誘發自身病毒重新激活，出現帶狀疱疹，故此並非由傳染而引發的疾病。患者皮膚出現一種令人痛楚、呈帶狀的紅疹並帶有水泡，一般並不嚴重，出現嚴重併發症或死亡風險不高，及早使用抗病毒藥物治療可加快水泡癒合、減輕症狀和出現併發症的風險。

接種帶狀疱疹疫苗可作為預防之用。現時有一款帶狀疱疹疫苗於本港註冊。根據現有的國際文獻資料，帶狀疱疹疫苗的有效保護期一般約為十年。

衞生署衞生防護中心轄下疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會（科學委員會）定期檢視本地疫苗可預防疾病的流行病學情況、世界衞生組織（世衞）的最新建議、疫苗的科學發展及證據、疫苗成分的更新、成本效益研究，以及其他衞生當局的實際應用經驗，從公共衞生角度向衞生署提供相關疫苗接種建議。政府會參考科學委員會的建議，並審慎評估多項因素，包括疾病對社會造成的整體醫療負擔、疫苗供應情況、大規模疫苗接種的成本效益、市民接受程度和其他公共衞生因素，以制訂各項政府資助免疫接種計劃。

就未納入政府資助免疫接種計劃的其他疫苗，市民可諮詢家庭醫生的專業意見，了解接種相關疫苗的效益、風險及必要性，並根據醫生對健康狀況、過往病歷等因素而作出的評估，在知情同意下決定是否安排接種。

就陸瀚民議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署和醫院管理局後，本局現回覆如下：

（一）及（三）科學委員會於二○二三年九月討論了接種帶狀疱疹疫苗事宜。科學委員會認為需要有更多涉及成本效益分析層面的本地數據，方得以考慮未來應否把帶狀疱疹疫苗納入政府的防疫注射計劃。科學委員會同時認為本港的帶狀疱疹疫苗安全及有效。個別較年長及免疫力弱的成人可考慮在諮詢醫生意見後接種帶狀疱疹疫苗，以保護自己免受帶狀疱疹及其併發症影響。

醫務衞生局已委託香港大學進行有關帶狀疱疹疫苗成本效益分析。待成本效益分析完成後，科學委員會預計將於二○二六年根據相關分析結果，討論帶狀疱疹疫苗接種事宜。

政府會繼續密切留意相關因素，包括世衞的最新建議、科學委員會的意見、疫苗的發展及成本變化、疾病的整體醫療負擔等，考慮是否有需要推行由政府資助的帶狀疱疹疫苗注射計劃。如確立有需要推行，亦須要考慮針對不同群組的資助水平。

另外，在基層醫療層面，家庭醫生和基層醫療專業人員會緊密合作，提供有關疫苗接種（包括帶狀疱疹疫苗）的資訊和教育，提升市民對帶狀疱疹疫苗的認識及預防意識。

（二）正如上文所述，帶狀疱疹一般並不嚴重，出現嚴重併發症或死亡風險不高。

帶狀疱疹的患者，受影響的部位首先會出現痕癢或微痛，帶有灼熱感覺，一至三天後才出現紅疹；紅疹會變成水泡，再蔓延成帶狀。水泡可持續一至14天，期間或會出現膿皰或血水。然後水泡會潰破或萎縮，乾水後結痂，為期兩至三星期。抗病毒特效藥可縮短帶狀疱疹痊癒所需的時間，在病發三至五天內服食最為理想。

政府鼓勵市民特別是免疫力弱人士提高警覺，如市民出現病徵，應盡早求醫，並按醫生指示用藥。同時，政府致力提升以地區為本的基層醫療健康服務，扭轉現時「重治療，輕預防」的醫療體制和觀念。措施包括政府透過地區康健中心推行「健康人生計劃」，針對市民不同人生階段的健康需求，根據市民的性別、年齡、家族病史等個人因素，制訂個人化的健康管理方案。政府透過家庭醫生和基層醫療專業人員提供慢性疾病和癌症篩查和健康生活模式的建議和教育，促進市民整體健康。政府亦藉此機會提醒巿民，保持良好生活習慣包括均衡飲食和適量運動，有助增強抵抗力和預防帶狀疱疹。"

立法會十題：工業用水的供應,2025-10-08 15:40,2025-10-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800482.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上洪雯議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

近日有營運數據中心的業界人士向本人反映，將軍澳創新園（前稱將軍澳工業邨）的工業用水供應量不足，窒礙需要大量工業用水的產業的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去10年，每年的工業用水量，以及其佔本港食水用量的比例為何；

（二）有否統計，過去10年由香港科技園公司管理的三個創新園（即大埔創新園、元朗創新園和將軍澳創新園）的用水量為何，以及有關用量佔本港整體工業用水量的比例分別為何；

（三）政府有否為各工業區及創新園的總體供水量，作出適當規劃，例如有否為各工業區及創新園設定供水量上限；

（四）鑑於政府於二○○六年開始在本港推行再造水試驗計劃，而據悉新加坡多年前已開始使用再造水作工業用途，本港現時再造水的工業應用範圍為何；有否計劃在創新園範圍推行再造水計劃；及

（五）鑑於本港正值新型工業化轉型期，不少數據中心、微電子行業、人工智能相關企業相繼落地，該等企業的特性是需要大量工業用水供冷卻系統運作，政府有否針對該等新興科企用水量的需求作出預測，以及有否制訂規劃方案，以應對未來工業用水量的持續上升？

答覆：

主席：

政府支援工業用水產業的發展，亦同時需要控制食水需求增長，措施包括積極鼓勵企業採用節水技術，及採用再造水及海水作工業用水用途，以提供穩定且經濟的水源。

（三）水務設施的規劃和設計主要是為了滿足人口對飲用水的需求和工商業（包括工業區及創新園）的用水需求。就規劃個別發展地區供水系統的時候，水務署會根據相關政策局所估算的用水量以規劃所需要的供水系統。

政府會持續按各區的最新發展情況和規劃，檢視相關的用水需求，及評估供水系統承載力是否足夠，以確保向現有用戶和已納入未來發展規劃的新用戶提供穩定及可靠的供水。如有需要，政府會適時考慮推展供水系統升級工程以提升供水系統承載力，滿足地區預計的整體用水需求。當中會考慮預計用水需求及其時間表、技術可行性、成本效益、現有供水系統的承載力，及整體基建項目推行的優次等因素。

過去幾年，政府留意到現時有部分地區的用水需求已接近現有供水系統設計承載力的上限。若某用戶申請涉及大量用水，政府會向申請者提供技術建議，採取適當方案，例如採用海水及再造水，以滿足其用水需求。以將軍澳創新園為例，該創新園已興建海水區域供冷系統，以應付其用水需求的增長。

（四）政府一直積極探討由中央系統供應再造水，供現時使用臨時淡水沖廁的地區及位於內陸的新發展區域使用，以控制食水需求增長。為進一步控制食水需求增長，政府正探討在區域供冷系統中使用再造水的可行性。水務署初步確定以再造水運行蒸發式區域供冷系統大致可行，目前正進行試行項目，為日後的供冷系統項目提供參考。

在規劃供應再造水系統時，政府會按個別地區的實際情況，考慮成本效益及技術可行性等因素，包括建造和運作成本、沖廁水量的需求、供應地區附近是否有三級污水處理廠可提供經高度處理的排放水等。

因應石湖墟污水處理廠將會提升為三級處理的淨水設施，政府已在石湖墟興建首間再造水廠，把經過三級處理的排放水加工生產成再造水，並已於二○二四年三月開始分階段向上水和粉嶺部分地區供應再造水作沖廁用途。此外，政府計劃於元朗、元朗南及新田科技城興建再造水廠及相關設施，顧問正進行相關設計工作，現時預計於二○三三年開始陸續落成。

政府會繼續在技術可行和符合經濟效益的情況下擴大再造水的非飲用的用途，以控制食水需求增長，並會繼續推行已制訂的水資源策略，一方面鼓勵企業採用節水技術；另一方面開拓多元化的水資源，以支持香港各行各業的持續發展。

（五）政府推出了一系列的政策措施致力推進新型工業化，以及本港人工智能及數據科學產業發展。隨着更多企業來港發展和新產業落地，其所需的資源亦有可能隨之增加。政府在規劃工業及創科用地的時候，會進行可行性研究，預留並規劃提供相關的基建及設施（包括創科工業用水及冷卻用水），以配合創科發展。政府會繼續積極與相關創科機構保持密切溝通，持續完善基建配套設施，為這些企業提供所需要的支援（例如協助業界協調及聯繫相關政府部門）。"
LCQ10: Industrial water supply,2025-10-08 15:40,2025-10-08 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800487.htm,"âFollowing is a question by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 ââSome members of the industry operating data centres have recently relayed to me that the industrial water supply at Tseung Kwan O InnoPark (formerly known as Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate) is insufficient, hindering the development of industries that require substantial industrial water usage. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the annual industrial water consumption over the past decade, and its percentage share of Hong Kong's total fresh water consumption;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the water consumption of the three InnoParks managed by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (namely Tai Po InnoPark, Yuen Long InnoPark and Tseung Kwan O InnoPark) over the past decade, and their respective percentage shares of Hong Kong's total industrial water consumption;

(3) whether the Government has made appropriate planning for the overall water supply to industrial areas and InnoParks, such as setting water supply caps for various industrial areas and InnoParks;

(4) given that the Government began implementing pilot schemes involving the use of reclaimed water in Hong Kong in 2006, and it is learnt that Singapore began using reclaimed water for industrial purposes years ago, of the current scope of industrial application of reclaimed water in Hong Kong; whether it has plans to implement schemes involving the use of reclaimed water in InnoParks; and

(5) given that Hong Kong is navigating through a period of new industrialisation, numerous data centres, microelectronics-related enterprises and artificial intelligence-related businesses are establishing their presence one after another, and that such enterprises typically require substantial industrial water supplies for operating cooling systems, whether the Government has forecast the water demand of these emerging technology enterprises and formulated planning proposals to address the anticipated sustained increase in industrial water consumption?

Reply:

President,

 ââThe Government supports the development of industries with industrial water usage on the one hand, while on the other hand contains fresh water demand growththrough various measures including actively encouraging enterprises to adopt water-saving technologies and to use reclaimed water and seawater for industrial purposes, thereby providing a stable and economical water supply.

 ââHaving consulted the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, our reply to the various parts of the question is set out below:

(1) Over the past decade, the annual industrial and cooling water consumption and its percentage share of Hong Kong's total fresh water consumption are listed in the following table:

(3) The planning and design of water supply facilities are primarily aimed to meet the population's demand for drinking water and water demand for industrial and commercial use (including industrial areas and InnoParks). During planning of the water supply system for individual development areas, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) will base on the water demands estimated by relevant policy bureaux to plan the required water supply system.

 ââThe Government will continuously review the relevant water demand of each district based on its latest development and planning, and assess the carrying capacity of the water supply system to ensure the provision of stable and reliable water supply to existing users and new users of future development. If necessary, the Government will consider implementing water supply system improvement projects in a timely manner to enhance the capacity of the water supply system to meet the projected overall water demand in the district with due consideration of the projected water demand and its timeline, technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, the capacity of the existing water supply system, and the priority of overall infrastructure projects.

 ââIn the past few years, the Government has noted that the current water demands in some districts have approached the upper limit of the design capacity of the existing water supply systems. In the event that an applicant applies for large amount of water usage, the Government will provide technical advice to the applicant so appropriate scheme, such as adopting seawater and reclaimed water, could be effected to meet its water demand. For example, a seawater district cooling system has been constructed at the Tseung Kwan O InnoPark to meet its increasing water demand.

(4) The Government has been actively exploring the use of reclaimed water by providing a centralised reclaimed water supply system in those areas where fresh water is being temporarily used for flushing and in new development areas located in inland areas to contain the fresh water demand growth.To further contain the growth of fresh water demand, the Government is exploring the feasibility of using reclaimed water in district cooling systems. The WSD preliminarily considers that the use of reclaimed water for evaporative district cooling systems is generally feasible, and is currently conducting a pilot project to serve as a reference for future cooling system projects.

 In planning reclaimed water supply system, the Government will take into account the actual situation of the areas, considering factors such as cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility, including the construction and operational costs, flushing water demand, proximity to tertiary sewage treatment plants which can provide highly treated discharge water, etc.

 With the upgrading of Shek Wu Hui Sewage Treatment Works to an effluent polishing plant with tertiary treatment level, the Government has constructed the first water reclamation plant in Shek Wu Hui to further process tertiary treated effluent to reclaimed water.This water reclamation plant was commissioned in March 2024 and has begun to supply reclaimed water in phases to certain areas of Sheung Shui and Fanling for flushing purpose.In addition, the Government plans to construct reclaimed water plants and the associated facilities in Yuen Long, Yuen Long South, and the San Tin Technopole. The consultants are currently carrying out the relevant design work. At present, it is anticipated that the reclaimed water plants will be completed progressively starting from 2033.

 Provided that it is technically feasible and economically viable, the Government will continue to expand the application of reclaimed water to other non-potable uses, in order to contain the growth of fresh water demand. The Government will also continue to implement the formulated water resources strategies, encouraging enterprises to adopt water-saving technologies on the one hand, and developing diversified water resources on the other hand, to support the sustainable development of all sectors in Hong Kong.

(5) The Government has rolled out a series of policies and measures to advance new industrialisation and foster the development of AI and data science industries in Hong Kong. As more enterprises and new industries establish a presence in Hong Kong, the demand for resources is expected to grow. In planning industrial land and land for innovation and technology, the Government will carry out feasibility studies, allocate and plan for the necessary infrastructure and facilities (including water for innovative industries process and cooling), to cope with the development of innovations and technologies. The Government will continue to engage closely with the relevant innovation and technology organisations, continue to enhance infrastructure and ancillary facilities, and provide necessary supports for these enterprises (for example, assistance in coordination and liaison with relevant Government departments)."
立法會二題：招商引資的工作,2025-10-08 15:35,2025-10-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800472.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上蘇長荣議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

由廣東省、香港和澳門三地政府於去年在廣州共同舉辦的粵港澳大灣區全球招商大會（招商大會），成為粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）城市攜手招商引資的有效渠道和重要平台。據報去年的招商大會取得了亮麗成績，共吸引430多名來自世界500強和行業龍頭企業的代表參與，簽訂的總投資額達到2.26萬億元人民幣。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據報招商大會將於每年的十一月八日定期舉辦，今年的招商大會將於哪個城市舉行；有否預計將邀請多少間外國和香港企業參加；特區政府會如何協助港企爭取新的投資及貿易項目；

（二）據報在去年招商大會共簽訂1 933項投資項目，當中香港有參與的投資項目為何；

（三）鑑於投資推廣署與內地對口單位成立「泛大灣區外來投資聯絡小組」，過去一年，該小組舉辦了多少項推介和其他招商引資活動；及

（四）會否考慮聯同大灣區其他內地城市到海外（例如中東及東南亞國家聯盟國家）舉辦招商引資活動？

答覆：

主席：

一直以來，投資推廣署在進行招商引資的工作時，均積極配合不同政策局推廣有利營商的政策，包括配合政制及內地事務局（政制局）宣傳粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）發展的相關機遇。投資推廣署亦與機構、商會、專業團體等合作，在內地及海外舉辦和贊助一系列投資推廣活動，包括路演、研討會、圓桌會議等，為企業提供香港營商環境的最新資訊，例如我們在「一國兩制」下的核心優勢和大灣區發展等國家重點戰略帶來的機遇，以吸引和鼓勵企業在香港開設或擴展業務。

就蘇長荣議員的提問，經諮詢政制局後，我綜合回應如下：

在政制局的支持下，投資推廣署於二○二一年與大灣區的相關部門成立「泛大灣區外來投資聯絡小組」（聯絡小組），透過制定聯合推廣建議和材料、聯合組織活動等，加強合作和協同效應。聯絡小組自二○二二年起每年在廣州舉辦粵港澳大灣區全球招商大會（全球招商大會），由粵港澳三地政府聯合向全球企業重點展示大灣區最新階段的建設成果及投資潛力。二○二五年的全球招商大會將於十一月三日在廣州舉行，並預計會邀請多間跨國和香港企業共約400名代表參加。特區政府會繼續在全球招商大會上積極推廣香港的營商優勢，吸引更多投資項目落戶香港。

在上述的全球招商大會中，投資推廣署接觸了不少有興趣來港設立或擴展業務的內地及海外企業，並按它們的需要提供一站式支援服務，發揮香港作為雙向跳板的獨特優勢。去年，全球招商大會簽訂超過1 900項投資項目，包括投資推廣署在內的聯絡小組積極跟進協助有關投資項目落地。由二○二四年至今年八月，投資推廣署共協助了983間內地及海外企業在香港開設或擴展業務，當中492間是海外企業，而超過120間是來自大灣區城市的內地企業。

除了舉辦全球招商大會外，聯絡小組亦會每年到海外舉辦招商引資活動，向當地企業推廣大灣區的最新政策措施及發展機遇。在二○二三及二○二四年，粵港澳三地政府分別於德國慕尼黑及法國巴黎聯合舉辦經貿合作交流會，向歐洲企業推介大灣區的投資環境及發展機遇；今年，三地政府再次拼船出海到匈牙利布達佩斯及埃及開羅舉辦投資推廣活動，推廣大灣區建設為歐洲及非洲商界發展帶來的商機，以及香港在「一國兩制」下作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的獨特角色與功能，並鼓勵企業落戶香港，開拓大灣區的龐大市場。

此外，投資推廣署亦在內地城市舉辦投資推廣活動，一直積極向內地企業介紹香港的營商優勢和機遇，以鼓勵當地企業來港投資並經香港發展國際業務。在二○二五年，該署已在寧波、濟南、武漢、青島、成都、廣州、北京、天津和瀋陽等地舉行多場推廣活動。

展望未來，投資推廣署會繼續配合政制局，並與聯絡小組成員保持緊密聯繫，共同推進大灣區相關的招商引資工作，一方面向海外企業推廣香港作為拓展大灣區業務的跳板並支援它們落戶香港，另一方面向大灣區企業推廣香港作為「出海」的跳板並支援它們落戶香港，而相關工作亦會與行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中公布內地企業出海專班的工作有機結合，進一步驅動「引進來、走出去」的雙向投資。聯絡小組亦會繼續積極計劃到其他有潛力的新興市場進行推廣和招商工作，進一步彰顯香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色。"
LCQ2: Efforts to attract investment,2025-10-08 15:35,2025-10-08 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800473.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 The Global Investment Promotion Conference for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Conference), jointly hosted by the governments of Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao in Guangzhou last year, has become as an effective channel and important platform for cities within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to collaborate in investment attraction efforts. It has been reported that the Conference achieved remarkable results last year, drawing the participation of over 430 representatives from Fortune Global 500 companies and top-notch enterprises in the industries, with total investment commitments amounting to RMB2.26 trillion. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is reported that the Conference will be held annually as a regular event on November 8, of the city which will host the Conference this year; whether an estimate is made on the number of foreign and Hong Kong enterprises to be invited; how the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will assist Hong Kong enterprises in securing new investment and trade projects;

(2) among the 1 933 investment projects reportedly signed at last year's Conference, of those involving the participation of Hong Kong;

(3) given that Invest Hong Kong and its Mainland counterpart have established the Pan-Greater Bay Area Inward Investment Liaison Group, of the number of promotional and other investment attraction activities organised by the Group over the past year; and

(4) whether it will consider organising overseas (such as in the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries) investment attraction activities in collaboration with other Mainland cities in the GBA?

Reply:

President,

 Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) has all along been proactively working with various policy bureaux to promote business-friendly policies in its investment promotion work, including working with the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau (CMAB) on initiatives relating to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) development. In addition, InvestHK collaborates with organisations, chambers of commerce and professional bodies, etc, to organise and sponsor an array of investment promotion activities on the Mainland and overseas, including roadshows, seminars and roundtables, to provide enterprises with the latest information on Hong Kong's business environment, including our core advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and opportunities arising from key national strategies such as the GBA development, thereby attracting and encouraging enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong.

 After consulting the CMAB, my consolidated response to Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing's question is as follows:

 With the support of the CMAB, the Pan-Greater Bay Area Inward Investment Liaison Group (Liaison Group) was established in 2021 by InvestHK and relevant GBA counterparts. Through developing joint propositions and promotion materials as well as organising joint events, the Liaison Group enhances collaboration and synergy among members of the Liaison Group. Since 2022, the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been jointly organising annually the Global Investment Promotion Conference for the GBA (Conference) in Guangzhou to showcase to global strategic enterprises the latest developments and investment potential of the GBA. The 2025 Conference will be held in Guangzhou on November 3, with participation by around 400 representatives from multinational and Hong Kong enterprises. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to proactively promote Hong Kong's business advantages at the Conference to attract more investment projects to land in Hong Kong.

 At the past Conferences, InvestHK engaged with many Mainland and overseas enterprises which were interested in setting up or expanding their businesses in Hong Kong and provided them with one-stop customised support services based on their needs, fully leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages as a two-way springboard. Last year, over 1 900 investment projects were signed during the Conference. The Liaison Group, with InvestHK being one of its members, is proactively following up and assisting in the implementation of these projects. From 2024 to August this year, InvestHK assisted 983 Mainland and overseas companies in setting up or expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, including 492 overseas companies and over 120 Mainland companies from GBA cities.

 Apart from organising the Conference, the Liaison Group also hosts overseas investment promotion events annually to promote to local businesses the latest policies and development opportunities in the GBA. In 2023 and 2024, the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao jointly hosted the economic and trade co-operation conferences in Munich, Germany, and Paris, France, to promote the GBA's investment environment and development opportunities to European enterprises. This year, the governments of the three regions again jointly held investment promotion events in Budapest, Hungary, and Cairo, Egypt, to promote to the European and African business communities the business opportunities brought by the GBA development, as well as Hong Kong's unique roles and functions as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. The events also encouraged businesses to establish presence in Hong Kong and tap into the vast market of the GBA.

 In addition, InvestHK has been organising investment promotion activities in various Mainland cities to proactively introduce Hong Kong's business advantages and opportunities to Mainland enterprises, so as to encourage them to invest in Hong Kong and expand international businesses via the city. In 2025, the department organised multiple promotional activities in Ningbo, Jinan, Wuhan, Qingdao, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin and Shenyang, etc.

 Looking ahead, InvestHK will continue to work with the CMAB and maintain close liaison with members of the Liaison Group to jointly take forward the investment promotion efforts related to the GBA. On the one hand, InvestHK will promote Hong Kong as a springboard for overseas businesses looking to expand into the GBA and support them to set up their operations here. On the other hand, we will also promote Hong Kong to GBA enterprises as a launchpad for going global and assist them in establishing presence in Hong Kong. The efforts will be organically integrated into the work of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global announced by the Chief Executive in his 2025 Policy Address, thereby enhancing two-way investment (viz. attracting investment inflows to Hong Kong and facilitating further investment beyond Hong Kong). Besides, the Liaison Group will also continue to proactively plan promotional and investment activities in other potential emerging markets to further highlight Hong Kong's roles as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder""."
行政長官在香港航商總會一週年慶典致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-08 15:30,2025-10-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800470.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月八日）在香港航商總會一週年慶典的視像致辭：

尊敬的梁振英副主席（全國政協副主席）、祁斌副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李永勝副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、趙式慶主席（香港航商總會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位航運界的朋友：

大家好！很高興通過視頻，和大家一同慶祝香港航商總會成立一周年。

國家《十四五規劃綱要》明確支持香港提升國際航運中心地位。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，加上國際化的營商環境，以及專業高效的航運服務體系，已經連續六年穩居全球第四大國際航運中心的地位，充分反映了我們在港口條件、專業海運服務、整體營商環境等的綜合實力雄厚。

近年，地緣政治局勢持續緊張，貿易格局和全球供應鏈正在重塑，全球航運業正面臨風高浪急的挑戰。然而，香港航運業展現了無比的韌力，在風浪中穩步前行。

面對變局，政府和業界並肩同行。我們積極推動航運業發展，已先後在二○二三和二○二四年公布了《海運及港口發展策略行動綱領》和《綠色船用燃料加注行動綱領》，為行業發展勾劃了清晰藍圖。

今年七月，我們成立了香港海運港口發展局，匯聚業界智慧，與政府攜手推動航運港口業多元和持續發展。

我在上個月發表的新一份《施政報告》，提出多項措施，以進一步鞏固香港國際航運中心地位。我們會建立通達內陸的「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系，積極拓展貨源；建立國際「伙伴港口」網絡，深化國際航運網絡交往。

我們會全力推動港口綠色化和數字化；並透過修例，增加船舶註冊的靈活性，加強電子化。我們也將為大宗商品貿易商落戶香港提供半稅優惠，帶動更多的需求。這些措施將進一步全面提升香港航運業的競爭力。

挑戰，是航行者衝破雲霧之風；機遇，是留給早已備好帆的船。我相信，航運業面對的機遇大於挑戰，我對香港的航運實力和廣闊前景，有堅定信心。

我期待香港航商總會繼續凝聚業界，與政府攜手推動行業高質量發展。我們共同努力，香港航運業必能乘風破浪，開拓新藍海，為國家建設海洋強國與交通強國作出更大貢獻。

最後，我祝願香港航商總會會務蒸蒸日上，在座各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 6 to noon today (October 8), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 263 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 100 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 170 713 samples of food imported from Japan (including 111 577 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 38 506 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

LCQ13: Barrier-free facilities in public housing,2025-10-08 14:47,2025-10-08 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800371.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Yang Wing-kit and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (Oct 8):

Question:

 Residents of certain aged public housing estates (including public rental housing (PRH) estates under the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) and rental estates under the Hong Kong Housing Society (HS)) have relayed that there is a lack of adequate barrier-free access and facilities within their estates, which is non-conducive to the mobility of the elderly and persons with impaired mobility. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the plans of the HA and HS to enhance barrier-free access and facilities in their aged PRH estates and rental estates (including the progress of ongoing projects); and

(2) as it is learnt that the staircase connecting Kau Pui Lung Road to Blocks A to E of Lok Man Sun Chuen under the HS serves as an essential access route to and from the estate, while there are views pointing out that this access route lacks barrier-free facilities, thereby causing inconvenience to the elderly and persons with impaired mobility in their daily access, whether the Government will urge the HS to construct an access ramp or install a lift at the relevant location in Lok Man Sun Chuen to address this issue; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 In response to the question raised by the Hon Yang Wing-kit, our reply is as follows:

(1) The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) endeavours to enhance barrier-free access and facilities in public rental housing (PRH) estates to meet the needs of PRH residents and users, particularly the elderly and persons with disabilities.

 It is the established policy of the HA to provide barrier-free access and facilities in accordance with the prevailing requirements as set out in the ""Design Manual: Barrier Free Access"" (DM), wherever practicable. In response to the introduction of the ""DM 1997"" and ""DM 2008"", the HA undertook necessary barrier-free facilities improvement works in 2001 and 2010 respectively for the premises that were completed prior to the publication of the DM. These improvement works included provision of ramps, installation of suitable handrails at access routes, provision and extension of tactile guide paths connecting the main entrances of the estates to major facilities within the estates and entrances of residential blocks, etc. However, some buildings may not be able to fully install relevant facilities or undergo modifications due to various constraints, such as building design. For all new HA buildings with construction commenced after December 1, 2008, and when existing HA buildings undergo alternations and additional works, the planning and implementation of works shall comply with the mandatory requirements as stipulated in ""DM 2008"" as far as practicable. In order to address the residents' diverse needs, the HA also makes flexible arrangements. For example, we are currently installing more accessible ramps in aged PRH estates including Ping Shek Estate, Wo Che Estate and Sha Kok Estate, to connect major facilities within the estates to facilitate residents' access. The HA has adopted the concept of ""Universal Design"" in new public housing estates to create an inclusive and harmonious living environment for people with different physical abilities.

 Moreover, in order to enhance the co-ordination of barrier-free initiatives in the public housing estates, the HA has launched the Access Co-ordinator and Access Officer Scheme since 2011. Access Officers stationed in various PRH estates are responsible for assisting individuals with needs in using the barrier-free access and facilities in the PRH estates.

 In addition to the provision of barrier-free facilities in common areas, the elderly or persons with disabilities can apply to the HA for adaptation works on facilities in the PRH flats if they have genuine needs. With reference to the advice from doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists or medical social workers, etc, the HA will carry out adaptation works free of charge for the tenants concerned. These works include installing ramp at the entrance of the flat where feasible, widening bathroom doorways, laying anti-skid floor tiles on suitable floor surface, etc. If tenants only request installing grab bars or converting a bathtub into a shower area in the bathroom, in general, the HA will directly arrange the relevant works for the tenant free of charge, without the need for tenant to seek advice from doctors or physiotherapists.

 As regards the Hong Kong Housing Society (HS), in response to the challenge of ""double ageing"", i.e. both the rental estates and residents are growing older, the HS has been continuously deploying resources in major improvement projects to enhance the accessibility of the buildings and public areas across its estates and add barrier-free facilities. Such efforts include adding lifts and transfer escalators, installing stairlifts, constructing transfer lift towers and connecting footbridge, etc. In addition, the HS has replaced over 70 lifts in its aged rental estates over the past decade and plans to progressively carry out lift replacement for other suitable aged rental estates. Moving forward, the HS will continue to assess the condition of its rental estates and explore introducing or enhancing barrier-free access and facilities where feasible and suitable.

(2) HS's Lok Man Sun Chuen, comprising 11 blocks, was completed in phases between 1970 and 1973. Six of these blocks (Blocks A to F) were built along a hilly slope, with Block F situated at a higher elevation. For the convenience of the residents, the HS completed the construction of a transfer lift tower and a footbridge connecting to Block F, as well as a covered walkway in 2014. Residents may take the lift to Block F through the level entrance on Kau Pui Lung Road beneath Block F, then descend to Blocks A to E, without having to walk uphill via the estate's main entrance on Kau Pui Lung Road.

 Currently, residents of Blocks A to E are still required to use staircases to reach the entrance of their respective blocks. To address this, the HS has commissioned an engineering consultant, who is now conducting a feasibility study on adding barrier-free access (such as ramps or lifts) at suitable locations across Blocks A to E, taking into account factors such as the site's geological conditions and the potential impact of the works on the residents' daily lives.

 In addition, the HS has also engaged a start-up to develop relevant PropTech solutions to assist residents in transporting heavy items such as rice, cooking oil and other daily necessities up and down staircases, further strengthening support for the residents.

 With regard to various facilities in the public housing estates, the HA and HS will continue to actively engage in communication and research with local communities/individuals as well as residents within the estates to explore ways to enhance these facilities, and address the needs of various persons in the estates, including the elderly and persons with disabilities."
LCQ9: Promoting development of private equity funds,2025-10-08 14:45,2025-10-08 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800286.htm,"  Following is a question by Hon Robert Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  The Government stated in the 2024 Policy Address that it would facilitate the opening of new distribution channels for private equity (PE) funds through the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX); and the 2025-26 Budget further mentioned that in order to facilitate more PE funds to list in Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) had clarified the relevant regulatory requirements to encourage sizeable alternative asset funds with regular income streams to raise funds. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will urge SFC and HKEX to work together on finalising the details of the relevant regulatory policies as soon as possible, such as establishing valuation standards, setting up a fast-track approval mechanism, etc., to facilitate the listing of more PE funds in the form of limited partnership funds in Hong Kong;

(2) whether, to attract more large overseas PE funds to list in Hong Kong, the Government will consider offering tax incentives and urge HKEX to reduce relevant listing fees;

(3) whether it will enhance collaboration with the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) to formulate guidelines for investing Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) assets in listed PE funds and clearly assign risk ratings (e.g. low, medium or high risk) to such funds so that MPF trustees can invest in suitable PE funds in accordance with their investment policies in the future; and

(4) whether it will introduce measures in collaboration with SFC, HKEX and MPFA on investor education on PE funds, such as organising seminars and developing risk disclosure handbooks, to raise the awareness of listed PE funds among retail and institutional investors, thereby promoting the development of PE fund business?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and its subsidiary, the Investor and Financial Education Council (IFEC), the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), the reply to the various parts of the question is as follows.

(1) The Government is committed to promoting the development of the financial markets. ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" announced that the Government would attract more global capital to be managed in Hong Kong, including facilitating the opening of new distribution channels for private equity funds (PE funds) through the HKEX's listing.

  In respect of authorising funds which seek a listing on the HKEX, the SFC issued a circular in February 2025 to clarify the regulatory requirements in relation to closed-ended funds that invest mainly in private and less liquid assets, thereby encouraging sizeable alternative asset funds (including PE funds, same hereinafter), preferably those with regular income streams, to list in Hong Kong. Relevant requirements have been included in the circular and the SFC's Code on Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds, including requirements on the management company's competence and experience, investments in a well-diversified portfolio of alternative assets, distribution policy, valuation and disclosure in offering documents. Due to a wide array of alternative assets available, the SFC may impose additional conditions, modify requirements, or allow flexibility in compliance with certain requirements, having regard to the fund's nature and investment strategy.

  The SFC has been in ongoing engagement with the industry, and has been in discussions with interested fund managers on their preliminary proposals for listed alternative asset funds. According to the SFC's understanding, these funds are planned to be structured in corporate or unit trust form, primarily investing in private equity, private credit and infrastructure debt.

  Based on the SFC's discussion with the industry, the SFC is of the view that, at the moment, it would be preferable for listed alternative asset funds to adopt existing public fund structures. These structures are familiar to and well understood by retail investors in Hong Kong, and there are comprehensive investor protection measures and regulatory requirements under the Code on Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds. The SFC will continue to explore the feasibility of the listing of alternative asset funds in limited partnership form.

(2) The Government is committed to providing a facilitative tax environment for the industry to attract more funds to set up and operate in Hong Kong. Under the prevailing tax regime, publicly offered funds are already exempt from profits tax. In addition, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (Tax Concessions for Carried Interest) Ordinance 2021 has been effective from May 2021, providing tax concessions for carried interest distributed by eligible PE funds operating in Hong Kong. The Government will endeavour to introduce a bill into the Legislative Council in the first half of 2026 to further enhance the preferential tax regimes for funds, single-family offices and carried interest, including enhancing the tax concession arrangement on the distribution of carried interest by PE funds, so as to attract more PE funds to set up in Hong Kong.

  Funds that are eligible to be authorised by the SFC and listed in Hong Kong under the Listing Rules should have sizeable asset under management and business operations, and they should have sufficient resources to cover the relevant costs of applying for listing. The listing fee collected by the HKEX only makes up a small proportion of the expenses associated with listing. The HKEX and the SFC will review the level of relevant fees under the HKEX from time to time so as to ensure their levels would be competitive as compared to other major markets.

(3) To enhance the risk-adjusted return potential of Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) funds, the Government and the MPFA have been committed to reviewing and broadening the MPF permissible asset classes. Having considered the potential benefits of allowing MPF investment in private equity to enhance diversification and return potential, the MPFA announced to the industry in May 2025 that listed PE funds meeting the relevant criteria and approved by the MPFA on a case-by-case basis can be included as a permissible underlying asset class for MPF funds. In view of the higher risks associated with listed PE funds as compared with traditional investment options, the total amount that an MPF fund can invest in approved listed PE funds is limited to 10 per cent of the fund's net asset value to safeguard the interests of scheme members.

  Investment managers of MPF funds should make professional decisions on whether to make relevant investment with due regard to the MPF fund's investment policy and objective. The MPFA currently has no plan to assign risk ratings to approved listed PE funds, but will closely monitor the situation and maintain dialogue with the industry. There are currently no listed PE funds included as permissible asset class for MPF funds. The MPFA will revise the relevant guidelines upon the approval of the first listed PE fund to facilitate investment decisions of investment managers.

(4) The Government has been supporting the SFC and its subsidiary, the IFEC, in carrying out investor education work through various means and channels. The SFC will work closely with the IFEC to issue general investor education materials to explain the investment opportunities and risks in respect of listed alternative asset funds, in order to help investors make informed investment decisions. For specific alternative asset fund products, as set out in the circular, the management company of an SFC-authorised listed alternative asset fund is expected to carry out extensive investor education before launching the fund in Hong Kong. The MPFA will also continue to promote MPF education through various activities and channels, with a view to enhancing scheme members' understanding of MPF investment options."
立法會九題：促進私募基金的發展,2025-10-08 14:45,2025-10-08 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800268.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上李惟宏議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

政府在二○二四年《施政報告》中表示會促進私募基金透過香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）開拓新銷售渠道；而二○二五至二六‍年度《財政預算案》進一步提到，為促進更多私募基金在港上市，證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）已釐清相關監管規定，鼓勵具規模、持續產生穩定收入的另類資產基金集資。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否促請證監會及港交所合作，盡早落實相關規管政策的細節，例如制訂估值標準、設立審批快速通道等，以促進更多私募基金透過有限合夥基金形式在港上市；

（二）為吸引更多海外大型私募基金來港上市，政府會否考慮提供稅務優惠，以及促請港交所降低有關上市費用；

（三）會否加強與強制性公積金計劃管理局（積金局）的合作，制訂有關強制性公積金（強積金）資產投資於上市私募基金的指引，並為該等基金明確劃分風險評級（例如低、中及高風險等），以便日後強積金受託人可根據其投資政策投資於合適的私募基金；及

（四）會否聯同證監會、港交所及積金局，推出針對私募基金投資者教育的措施（例如舉辦研討會及制訂風險披露手冊等），以提高零售及機構投資者對上市私募基金的認識，從而促進私募基金業務的發展？

答覆:

主席：

就問題的各部分，經諮詢證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及其轄下的投資者及理財教育委員會（投委會）、強制性公積金計劃管理局（積金局），以及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所），現回覆如下。

（一）政府致力推動金融市場發展。《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出，政府會推動更多環球資金在港管理，包括促進私募基金透過港交所開拓新銷售渠道。

就認可擬於港交所上市的基金，證監會於二○二五年二月發出通函，釐清當中有關主要投資於私募及流通性較低資產的封閉式基金的規定，以鼓勵具規模，尤其是能持續產生穩定收入的另類資產基金（包括私募基金，下同）在港上市。相關規定已在通函及證監會《單位信託及互惠基金守則》內列出，包括對管理公司勝任能力和經驗的要求、基金應投資於足夠分散的另類資產投資組合、基金分派政策、估值以及於銷售文件中的披露。鑑於另類資產種類繁多，證監會可視乎基金的性質及投資策略施加額外條件、修改規定，或就遵守某些要求作出靈活安排。

證監會一直與業界保持溝通，並與有興趣的基金經理就其初步提出的上市另類資產基金建議進行討論。據證監會了解，這些基金準備以公司形式或單位信託基金形式設立，並主要投資於私募股權、私募信貸及基礎設施債務。

根據證監會與業界的討論，證監會認為目前上市另類資產基金宜採用現有的公募基金架構。這些架構為香港零售投資者所熟悉及理解，並根據《單位信託及互惠基金守則》設有完善的投資者保障措施及監管規定。證監會將繼續探討另類資產基金以有限合夥形式上市的可行性。

（二）政府致力締造有利業界的税務環境，以吸引更多基金在香港落戶及營運。在現行的稅制下，向公眾發售的基金已可獲豁免繳付利得税。此外，《2021年税務（修訂）（附帶權益的税務寬減）條例》自二○二一年五月生效，為在香港營運的合資格私募基金所分發的附帶權益提供税務寬減。政府將爭取於二○二六年上半年向立法會提交條例草案，進一步優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠税制，當中包括優化私募基金分發附帶權益的税務寬減安排，以吸引更多私募基金落戶香港。

符合資格獲證監會認可並通過《上市規則》在港上市的基金在管理資產金額和業務都有一定規模，應有足夠資源應付申請上市的相關費用。港交所收取的上市費用只佔上市成本的小部分。港交所和證監會將不時檢討港交所的相關收費標準，確保其與其他主要市場相比具競爭力。

（三）為提升強制性公積金（強積金）基金經風險調整的回報潛力，政府和積金局一直致力檢視和擴闊強積金可投資的資產類別。考慮到容許強積金投資於私募股權有助加強強積金分散投資和提升其回報潛力，積金局於二○二五年五月向業界公布，符合準則的上市私募基金經積金局個別核准後，可納入為強積金基金的准許資產類別。考慮到上市私募基金相比傳統投資選項具有較高風險，強積金基金可投資於獲核准的上市私募基金的總額，限於該基金淨資產值的百分之十，以保障計劃成員的利益。

強積金基金的投資經理應視乎基金的投資政策和目標，就進行有關投資作出專業決定。積金局目前沒有計劃為獲核准的上市私募基金訂定風險評級，但會密切留意情況，並與業界保持溝通。現時未有上市私募基金被納入為強積金基金的准許資產類別，積金局會在核准首隻上市私募基金後修訂相關指引，便利投資經理作出投資決定。

（四）政府一直支持證監會及轄下的投委會，透過不同形式和渠道進行投資者教育工作。證監會將與投委會緊密合作，發布一般性的投資者教育資料，闡釋與上市另類資產基金相關的投資機遇和風險，協助投資者作出有根據的投資決定。就個別另類資產基金產品而言，如通函所述，證監會預期認可上市另類資產基金的管理公司於香港推出基金前，需進行廣泛的投資者教育。積金局亦會繼續推廣強積金教育，透過各項活動和渠道加強計劃成員對強積金投資選項的認識。"
​立法會四題：為來港參與短期活動的訪客提供便利,2025-10-08 14:42,2025-10-08 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800366.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上霍啟剛議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，政府推出的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（該計劃）旨在提供入境便利安排予獲認可主辦機構邀請或保證來港參與有利香港發展的短期活動訪客，讓他們在以訪客身分逗留期間，參與12個指定界別下的指定活動，對推動香港建設「八大中心」具積極意義。然而，有意見指出二○二五至二○二六財政年度的《財政預算案》提出增設各項人才入境計劃的申請費並上調簽證費，對未獲納入為該計劃獲認可主辦機構名單的機構（非認可機構）造成成本壓力。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年透過該計劃來港的訪客所獲批准參與的活動數目，並按活動類別、活動的舉行天數（即一天至三天、四天至七天、八天至10天，以及10天以上）和指定界別列出分項數字；

（二）自增設人才入境計劃的申請費和上調簽證費後，政府有否評估有關安排對非認可機構所造成的財務負擔，以及其舉辦活動數目的影響，包括因簽證成本造成財務壓力而取消的活動數目；如有，結果為何；

（三）鑑於有業界人士反映，機構須為獲邀來港參與不屬該計劃指定界別活動的短期訪客申請工作簽證，因應簽證成本上升或需減少舉辦國際交流活動，政府有何具體措施支援該等機構，例如設立費用較低的超短期工作簽證及簡化簽證申請程序等；

（四）為確保該計劃持續切合業界需要，政府有否設立定期檢討機制，包括諮詢相關界別代表以更新認可主辦機構名單；會否加強向業界宣傳該計劃內容，明確說明申請人士的資格和條件，以及各個指定界別活動的具體要求；及

（五）鑑於有意見認為，該計劃下「文化藝術」界別的認可主辦機構只有四個（包括文化體育及旅遊局、康樂及文化事務署、香港藝術發展局及西九文化區管理局），導致許多文化藝術團體難以受惠於該計劃，有違計劃初衷，政府會否檢討認可主辦機構的甄選機制，包括擴大文化藝術界別的認可主辦機構範圍至其他具認受性的藝術團體；如會，詳情及時間表為何？

答覆︰

主席：

為促進更多人才訪港交流，政府於二○二二年六月推出為期兩年的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利先導計劃」（先導計劃），並於二○二四年六月把先導計劃恆常化為「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）。在短期訪客計劃下，獲政府相關決策局／部門認可的機構可向界別內相關的非本地人才發出邀請信，獲邀人士可以訪客身分來港參與指定短期活動，而無須向入境事務處（入境處）申請工作簽證／進入許可。他們每次來港可在不超過連續14個曆日期間參與指定短期活動，並可就該指定活動收取報酬。

就霍議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局（勞福局）及入境處後，我現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年六月底，先導計劃／短期訪客計劃已合共惠及36 951名非本地人才，便利他們以訪客身分來港參與共6 200多項短期活動，當中包括新春國際匯演之夜、亞洲金融論壇、香港國際七人欖球賽等盛事，他們在港參與相關短期活動的時間平均約為五天。按界別的統計數字載於附件。入境處沒有備存提問涉及的其他分項統計數字。

（二）勞福局表示，政府在制訂各項人才與資本投資者的入境計劃的收費水平時已平衡各方面的考慮因素，包括「用者自付」原則、海外地區類似申請的收費水平及對相關申請者的影響。其中，考慮到部分申請涉及短期／一次性項目為本的工作，政府在申請費以外實施兩級制簽發費，逗留期限為180日或以下的簽證／入境證簽發費為600元，而181日或以上的則為1,300元，屬合理和可負擔範圍水平。

自有關收費生效後，過去數月有關入境計劃的申請和簽證／入境證簽發數目與去年同期相若。政府會密切留意相關情況，按機制適時檢討收費架構。

（三）至（五）如前述，政府會按機制適時檢討各項人才與資本投資者的入境計劃的簽證／入境證收費架構。

另一方面，為確保短期訪客計劃與時並進，政府不時審視計劃的涵蓋範圍及運作機制，務求使計劃能夠在風險可控的前提下，持續有效地促進相關界別發展，並提升香港的國際形象。自先導計劃推出以來，政府分別兩次在二○二三年二月以及二○二四年六月擴大計劃，在原有10個指定界別外，增加「金融」及「發展與建築」兩個新界別，認可機構亦從計劃剛推出時約350個增加18%至現時的400多個，當中包括政府決策局／部門、公營／法定機構、專業組織和業界協會等。計劃下設有機制，各參與的政策局／部門均會協助把關，確保計劃的執行持續符合政策目標。短期訪客計劃的相關資料，包括目前涵蓋的認可機構和指定短期活動已上載入境處網站: www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/visas/stv.html。

目前，不同類別的機構均可與計劃下的認可機構合作舉辦合資格的指定短期活動，以享相關入境便利。我們歡迎業界主動與所屬界別的相關決策局／部門或認可機構聯絡並考慮合辦合資格的活動，以期促進計劃下更多不同形式的交流合作。

在考慮是否進一步放寬計劃時，政府必須考慮兩大原則，包括合資格根據計劃來港進行指定短期活動的人士不會取代本地勞動力，及不會構成濫用風險（包括非法就業）。政府會繼續留意短期訪客計劃的實施情況和相關部門及業界的意見，適時檢討計劃的涵蓋範圍，以期在入境管制與便利之間取得適當平衡。"
LCQ4: Providing facilitation for visitors coming to Hong Kong to participate in short-term activities,2025-10-08 14:42,2025-10-08 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800368.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Fok and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) launched by the Government aims to provide immigration facilitation arrangements to visitors invited or sponsored by authorised host organisations to come to Hong Kong for undertaking short-term activities which are beneficial to the development of Hong Kong and allow them to participate in specified activities in 12 designated sectors during the period of their stay as visitor, which is of positive significance in promoting Hong Kong to develop the ""eight centres"". However, there are views pointing out that the 2025-2026 Budget proposes to introduce application fees for various talent admission schemes and increase visa fees, which will impose cost pressure on the organisations which have not been included in the list of authorised host organisations under the STV Scheme (unauthorised organisations). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of activities in which visitors coming to Hong Kong under the STV Scheme were allowed to participate in each of the past three years, with a breakdown by type of activities, duration of activities (i.e. 1 to 3 days, 4 to 7 days, 8 to 10 days, and over 10 days) and designated sector;

(2) since the introduction of application fees for talent admission schemes and increase in visa fees, whether the Government has assessed the financial burden imposed on unauthorised organisations by such arrangements, as well as the impact on the number of activities organised by such organisations, including the number of activities cancelled due to financial pressure arising from additional visa fees; if so, of the outcome;

(3) as some members of the industry have relayed that it may necessitate a reduction in international exchange activities due to the rising costs for visa application since organisations are required to apply for employment visas for visitors invited to Hong Kong to participate in short-term activities not covered by activities in the designated sectors under the STV Scheme, of the Government's specific measures in place to support such organisations, such as introducing extremely short-term employment visas at lower costs and streamlining visa application procedures;

(4) to ensure that the STV Scheme remains relevant to industry needs, whether the Government has established mechanisms for regular review, including consulting the representatives from the relevant sectors to update the list of authorised host organisations; whether it will step up efforts in promoting the STV Scheme to the industry, so as to clearly explain the application eligibility and requirements, as well as the specific requirements for activities in each designated sector; and

(5) as there are views that since only four organisations are recognised as authorised host organisations in the ""art and cultural"" sector under the STV Scheme (namely the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Hong Kong Arts Development Council and West Kowloon Cultural District Authority), it is difficult for many arts and cultural groups (arts groups) to benefit from the STV Scheme, which is contrary to the original intent of the Scheme, whether the Government will review the selection mechanism for authorised host organisations, including expanding the coverage of authorised host organisations in the ""art and cultural"" sector to include other recognised arts groups; if so, of the details and timetable?

Reply:

President,

  To encourage more talent to come to Hong Kong for exchanges, the Government launched a two-year Pilot Scheme on Immigration Facilitation for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (Pilot Scheme) in June 2022, which was regularised as the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) in June 2024. Under the STV Scheme, organisations authorised by the relevant government bureaux/departments (B/Ds) can issue invitation letters to relevant non-local talent in their sectors. Invited persons may come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the Immigration Department (ImmD). They may participate in specified short term activities for up to 14 consecutive calendar days during each trip to Hong Kong, and receive remuneration for the specified activities concerned.

  In consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the ImmD, my reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Kenneth Fok is as follows:

(1) As of end-June 2025, the Pilot Scheme/STV Scheme had benefited a total of 36 951 non-local talent, facilitating their entry into Hong Kong as visitors to participate in a total of over 6 200 short-term activities such as the International Chinese New Year Night Parade, the Asian Financial Forum, the Hong Kong Sevens and other major events. They participated in the relevant short-term activities in Hong Kong for about five days on average. The statistics by sector are at Annex. The ImmD does not maintain a breakdown of other statistics mentioned in the question.

(2) LWB indicates that in devising the fee levels for the various admission schemes for talent and capital investors, the Government has balanced various considerations, including the ""user pays"" principle, the fees charged for similar applications in overseas jurisdictions, and the impact on the applicants concerned. In particular, noting that some applications relate to short-term/one-off project-based employment, in addition to application fee, the Government has introduced two tiers of visa/entry permit issuance fee: $600 for visa/entry permit granted with a limit of stay of not more than 180 days, and $1,300 for those with a limit of stay of 181 days or more. The fee levels are modest and affordable.

  Since the introduction of the relevant fees, the number of applications and visas/entry permits issued under the specified admission schemes in the past few months were comparable to those in the same period last year. The Government will closely monitor the relevant situation and review the fee structure as appropriate in accordance with the established mechanism.

(3) to (5) As above-mentioned, the Government will review the visa/entry permit fee structure for the various admission schemes for talent and capital investors as appropriate in accordance with the established mechanism.

  On the other hand, to ensure that the STV Scheme keeps pace with the times, the Government reviews its coverage and operation mechanism from time to time, with a view to ensuring that it can continue to effectively promote the development of relevant sectors and raise Hong Kong's international profile while ensuring that the risks are manageable. Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the Government has expanded the scheme twice in February 2023 and June 2024, by adding two new sectors, namely ""Finance"" and ""Development and Construction"", to the original 10 designated sectors. The number of authorised organisations has also increased by 18 per cent from around 350 when the scheme was first launched, to more than 400 at present. These authorised organisations include government B/Ds, public/statutory organisations, professional bodies and industry associations, etc. Through an established mechanism, all participating B/Ds would assist in ensuring that the implementation of the scheme consistently meets policy objectives. Relevant information of the STV Scheme, including the authorised organisations and specified short-term activities that are currently covered by the scheme, is available on the ImmD's website: www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/stv.html.

  At present, different types of organisations can collaborate with authorised organisations under the scheme to organise eligible specified short-term activities, thereby benefiting from the relevant immigration facilitation. We welcome the industry to contact relevant B/Ds or authorised organisations in their respective sectors and consider co-organising eligible events, with a view to promoting more diverse forms of exchange and collaboration under the scheme.

  In considering whether to further relax the scheme, the Government shall take into account two major principles, including that eligible individuals visiting Hong Kong for specified short-term activities under the scheme will not displace the local workforce, and there will not be a risk of abuse (including illegal employment). The Government will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the STV Scheme as well as the views of the relevant departments and the sectors concerned, and timely review the scheme's coverage to strike an appropriate balance between immigration control and facilitation."
立法會十四題：「港資港法」與「港資港仲裁」措施,2025-10-08 14:30,2025-10-08 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800318.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上嚴剛議員的提問和律政司司長林定國資深大律師的書面答覆：

問題：

《〈內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排〉服務貿易協議》的第二份修訂協議（《修訂協議二》）新增「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」作為便利香港投資者的措施，支持粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）試點城市註冊的港資企業，協議選擇使用香港或澳門法律為合同適用法，以及支持在大灣區珠三角九市註冊的港資企業，選擇香港或澳門為仲裁地。此外，最高人民法院及司法部於本年二月印發的《關於充分發揮仲裁職能作用服務粵港澳大灣區高質量發展的意見》提出擴展該兩項措施的細節。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）就《修訂協議二》新增的「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」措施，政府會否明確訂明有關的適用範圍，包括涵蓋的行業及案件類別；若會，何時公布有關詳情；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，目前內地與香港在仲裁程序（例如緊急仲裁員制度和臨時措施的申請程序等）上存在差異，在推行「港資港仲裁」措施的過程中，政府如何參與制訂有關的仲裁規則，以及會否推動採用國際通行標準；及

（三）鑑於粵港澳三地將共同商定建立《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊》，政府如何確保本地仲裁員的專業資格與內地標準對接；會否進一步優化各項人才入境計劃，以吸引更多國際仲裁專家來港發展？

答覆：

主席︰

就嚴剛議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）「港資港法」措施自二○二○年在深圳前海試行，而「港資港仲裁」措施則在二○一七年起於內地自由貿易試驗區試行，兩項措施均受持份者歡迎。

二○二四年十月兩地簽訂《〈內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排〉服務貿易協議》的第二份修訂協議，其中將「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」措施首次納入《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》，並明確支持在粵港澳大灣區內擴大該兩項措施適用範圍，體現中央政府對於香港法律制度的重視與支持。

「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」的擴展已經自二○二五年二月十四日起實施，相關適用範圍及細節載於：（一）最高人民法院發出的《關於在粵港澳大灣區內地登記設立的香港、澳門投資企業協議選擇港澳法律為合同適用法律或者協議約定港澳為仲裁地效力問題的批覆》（法釋〔2025〕3 號）；以及（二）最高人民法院與司法部共同發出的《關於充分發揮仲裁職能作用服務粵港澳大灣區高質量發展的意見》。

根據上述最高人民法院與司法部發出的兩份文件的規定，兩項措施的擴展詳情如下：


「港資港法」措施由前海擴展至深圳及珠海。擴展後，當事人一方或雙方為在深圳或珠海登記設立的香港投資企業，可協議選擇香港或澳門特區法律為合同適用法律；
「港資港仲裁」措施從內地自由貿易試驗區，進一步涵蓋粵港澳大灣區內地九市。擴展後，當事人一方或雙方為在內地自由貿易試驗區及大灣區內地九市登記設立的香港投資企業，可在無「涉港澳因素」的情況下，選擇香港、澳門作為仲裁地；及
明確「香港投資企業」寬鬆定義：全部或部分由香港特區的自然人、企業或者其他組織投資，依法在內地登記設立的企業，均可受惠於兩項措施。


相關企業是否能享受「港資港法」或「港資港仲裁」措施，視乎該企業的登記地點，以及是否符合港資身分，並無行業及案件類別的限制。換句話來說，只要是在措施適用的地點登記設立的港資企業，即可受惠於相關措施。

（二）香港作為中國境內唯一實行普通法的司法管轄區，仲裁制度成熟、現代化，並與國際最佳做法高度接軌。就法律框架而言，香港《仲裁條例》（第609章）採納了聯合國國際貿易法委員會的《國際商事仲裁示範法》作為仲裁立法的藍本，為仲裁提供了基本的法律框架，包括司法保障和協助。

在當事人自主的原則下，當事人可自由選擇仲裁機構、仲裁規則等以管理具體的仲裁程序。而各仲裁機構獨立運作，不受政府干預。

根據倫敦大學瑪麗皇后學院最新進行的國際仲裁調查，香港獲評為與新加坡並列的全球第二最受歡迎仲裁地，反映香港的仲裁法律框架成熟完善，並獲國際商業社會認可。此外，在同一調查中，香港國際仲裁中心規則獲選為全球第二受歡迎的仲裁規則，可見不同司法管轄區的當事人，均信賴並樂意選擇在香港進行仲裁程序。

（三）仲裁員的專業資格方面

為建立《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊》，律政司與廣東和澳門的法律部門於二○二五年七月三十日共同正式發布及實施《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊工作指引》，當中列出三地共同認可的仲裁員推薦條件，以確保大灣區仲裁員的專業素質。

大灣區仲裁員推薦條件包括（一）擁護《中華人民共和國憲法》，擁護《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區基本法》、《中華人民共和國澳門特別行政區基本法》；（二）職業道德良好，未有因不良名譽或者違反職業道德受懲處的紀錄；（三）獲內地、香港或澳門其中兩地的仲裁機構納入其仲裁員名冊；（四）具有累計五年以上擔任仲裁員實務經驗；（五）累計擔任至少五宗仲裁案件的仲裁員並撰寫仲裁裁決，其中至少三宗仲裁案件為跨法域仲裁案件；（六）熟練掌握普通話（或粵語）和至少一門中文以外的語言。

粵港澳大灣區法律部門聯席會議（聯席會議）可按被推薦人的實際情況豁免上述第（三）至（六）項中一項或多項條件要求。三地法律部門也可結合本地實際情況，在上述統一推薦條件的基礎上增加推薦條件，並向聯席會議報備。

律政司正積極與廣東及澳門相關部委保持聯繫，爭取在今年底前訂立《粵港澳大灣區仲裁員名冊》，鼓勵仲裁在大灣區內的應用，並為用家提供更多便利。

人才入境計劃方面

政府致力鞏固香港作為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位，並推出了一系列政策吸引及便利國際仲裁專家來港進行仲裁相關的業務。

政府於二○一八年制訂首份香港人才清單，旨在更有效及聚焦地吸引高質素人才，以配合香港經濟高增值及多元化的發展。人才清單持續更新和優化，在現行人才清單的爭議解決專才領域下，已涵蓋專門解決國際商業、金融，以及國家與投資者之間糾紛的仲裁員。

政府亦於二○二五年三月一日起恆常推行「為來港參與仲裁程序的人士提供入境便利計劃」。在計劃下，有關人士如持有由指定仲裁及爭議解決機構或場地提供者發出的證明書，證明其為參與在香港進行的仲裁程序的合資格人士，便可獲准以訪客身分來港參與仲裁程序，無須取得工作簽證。

經優化的計劃涵蓋五類人士：（一）仲裁員；（二）專家證人和事實證人；（三）代表仲裁程序任何一方的律師；（四）仲裁程序各方；以及（五）與仲裁直接有關或參與仲裁的其他人士例如仲裁庭秘書、仲裁庭指定專家。

政府會持續密切監察有關政策措施的運作情況，並適時檢討與優化。"
"LCQ14: The measures of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" and ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong""",2025-10-08 14:30,2025-10-08 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800321.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Erik Yim and a written reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

The Second Agreement Concerning Amendment to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement Agreement on Trade in Services (Amendment Agreement II) brings the addition of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" and ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong"" as facilitation measures for Hong Kong investors, supports Hong Kong-invested enterprises registered in the pilot municipalities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to adopt Hong Kong law or Macao law as the applicable law in their contracts, and supports Hong Kong-invested enterprises registered in the nine Pearl River Delta municipalities in the GBA to choose Hong Kong or Macao as the seat of arbitration. In addition, the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice jointly issued the Opinion on Fully Leveraging the Functions of Arbitration to Serve the High-Quality Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in February this year to propose the extension details of the two measures. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) regarding the addition of the measures of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" and ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong"" under Amendment Agreement II, whether the Government will clearly specify their scopes of application, including the industries and types of cases covered; if so, when the relevant details will be announced;

(2) given the views that at present there are differences in the arbitral proceedings between the Mainland and Hong Kong (such as the emergency arbitrator system and application procedures for interim measures), how the Government will take part in formulating the relevant arbitration rules in implementing the measure of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong"", and whether it will promote the adoption of internationally accepted standards; and

(3) given that Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have agreed to jointly establish the Panel of GBA Arbitrators, how the Government will ensure that the professional qualifications of local arbitrators align with the standards adopted in the Mainland; whether it will further enhance the various talent admission schemes to attract more international arbitration experts to come to Hong Kong for development?

Reply:

President,

In response to the enquiry raised by the Hon Erik Yim, the reply is as follows:

(1) The measure of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" has been piloted in Qianhai, Shenzhen, since 2020 whereas the measure of ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration"" has been in trial implementation since 2017 in Chinese Mainland's Pilot Free Trade Zones. Both measures have been well received by stakeholders.

In October 2024, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the Chinese Mainland signed the Second Agreement Concerning Amendment to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement Agreement on Trade in Services, which, for the first time, incorporated the above two measures into the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement. The amendments support the expansion of the applicable scope of these two measures in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, reflecting the Central Government's emphasis and support for Hong Kong's legal system.

The extension of both measures has been in force since February 14, 2025. Details such as the applicable scope are set out in: (1) the Supreme People's Court's ""Official Reply on the Issues concerning the Validity of the Adoption of Hong Kong or Macao Law as the Applicable Law of Contracts or the Designation of Hong Kong or Macao as the Seat of Arbitration by Hong Kong or Macao-Invested Enterprises Registered in the Mainland Part of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"" (Fa Shi No. 3 [2025]); and (2) ""Opinion on Fully Leveraging the Functions of Arbitration to Serve the High-Quality Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"" jointly issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice.

According to the two documents issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice, the details of the expansion are as follows:

• The ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law"" measure is extended from Qianhai, Shenzhen to the whole of Shenzhen and Zhuhai municipalities. After the expansion, where either party or both parties are Hong Kong-invested enterprises registered in Shenzhen or Zhuhai, the parties may agree to choose Hong Kong or Macao law as the law applicable to the contract;

• The ""allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration"" measure, previously applicable to Pilot Free Trade Zones in the Chinese Mainland, is further extended to nine Mainland municipalities in the GBA. After the expansion, where either party or both parties are Hong Kong-invested enterprises established and registered in any of the said municipalities, the parties may agree to choose Hong Kong or Macao as the seat of arbitration even in the absence of ""Hong Kong/Macao-related elements""; and

• The definition of ""Hong Kong-invested enterprise"" is broadened: enterprises which are wholly or partially invested by natural persons, enterprises or other organisations from the Hong Kong SAR and are established and registered in the Chinese Mainland in accordance with its laws, may benefit from these measures.

Whether an enterprise can benefit from the above two measures depends on its place of registration and whether it is Hong Kong-invested as defined above. There are no restrictions on industry or case type. In other words, any Hong Kong-invested enterprise registered in a qualifying location can benefit from the respective measures.

(2) As the only common law jurisdiction in China, Hong Kong has a mature and modern arbitration system that is highly aligned with international best practice. In terms of legal framework, Hong Kong's Arbitration Ordinance (Cap. 609) is based on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, providing a basic legal framework for arbitration including judicial safeguards and support.

Under the principle of party autonomy, parties are free to choose the arbitral institutions, arbitration rules, etc to govern their specific arbitral proceedings. Arbitral institutions operate independently and are not subject to government interference.

According to the latest International Arbitration Survey conducted by Queen Mary University of London, Hong Kong is ranked the second most preferred seat of arbitration globally, along with Singapore. This reflects the maturity and comprehensiveness of Hong Kong's arbitration legal framework, which is recognised by the international business community. Furthermore, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre Rules is ranked the second most preferred set of arbitration rules globally in the same survey, demonstrating the trust and willingness of parties from various jurisdictions to conduct arbitral proceedings in Hong Kong.

(3) Regarding the professional qualifications of arbitrators

To establish the Panel of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Arbitrators (Panel of GBA Arbitrators), the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the legal departments of Guangdong and Macao, have jointly promulgated the Working Guidelines on the Panel of GBA Arbitrators (Working Guidelines) on July 30, 2025. The Working Guidelines set out the criteria recognised by the three places for nominating arbitrators to ensure the professionalism of GBA arbitrators.

The criteria for nomination of GBA arbitrators include: (1) upholding the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China; (2) possessing good professional ethics with no record of disciplinary action for negative reputation or professional misconduct; (3) being included in the list of arbitrators by arbitral institutions in two out of the three places, namely Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao; (4) possessing more than five years of experience as an arbitrator; (5) having served as an arbitrator and drafted awards for at least five arbitration cases, of which at least three were cross-jurisdictional arbitration cases; (6) proficient in Putonghua (or Cantonese) and at least one language other than Chinese.

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Legal Departments Joint Conference (Joint Conference) may, depending on the actual circumstances of the nominated arbitrator, exercise its discretion to exempt one or more of the requirement(s) among items (3) to (6) above. The legal departments of the three places may, having regard to their local actual circumstances, impose additional local criteria for nomination in addition to the above-mentioned unified criteria for nomination, and report to the Joint Conference for record.

The DoJ is actively liaising with the relevant authorities in Guangdong and Macao, aiming to establish the Panel of GBA Arbitrators before the end of this year, and to encourage the use of arbitration in the GBA and provide greater convenience for users.

Regarding talent admission mechanisms

The Government is committed to strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre and has introduced a series of policies to attract and facilitate international arbitration experts to conduct arbitration-related work in Hong Kong.

The Government promulgated the first Talent List of Hong Kong in 2018, aiming to attract high quality talents more effectively and in a focused manner to support Hong Kong's high value-added and diversified economy. The Talent List has been continuously updated and refined. Under the current Talent List, arbitrators specialising in resolving international commercial, financial and investor-state disputes are already included in the category of Dispute Resolution Professionals.

The Government has also regularised the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Persons Participating in Arbitral Proceedings in Hong Kong (Scheme) with effect from March 1, 2025. Under the Scheme, relevant individuals are allowed to participate in arbitral proceedings in Hong Kong as visitors without the need to obtain an employment visa if they are in possession of a letter of proof issued by a designated arbitral and dispute resolution institution or venue provider proving that they are eligible persons participating in arbitral proceedings in Hong Kong.

This refined Scheme covers five categories of persons: (1) arbitrators; (2) expert and factual witnesses; (3) counsel in the arbitration; (4) parties to the arbitration; and (5) other persons directly related to or involved in the arbitration such as tribunal secretaries, tribunal-appointed experts.

The Government will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the relevant policy initiatives, and review and refine them in a timely manner."

同期沒有因此而被吊銷食肆牌照的個案。

地租方面，就在政府土地上設置露天座位申請，地政總署或負責管轄有關土地的部門在考慮相關部門意見後，一般會因應土地使用的個別情況批出土地牌照或短期租約等。截至二○二五年八月底，獲批的土地牌照或短期租約每年所須繳付的相關費用如下：




獲批方式
平均費用


土地牌照
每平方米約3.4港元


短期租約
每平方米約630港元



註：每個個案需繳付的費用須視乎土地位處區域。

（三）食環署會統籌相關部門一同進行「會審」共同處理問題，同時亦會精簡程序，包括設立露天座位的標準地租、容許部分申請無需增加廚房面積及洗手間設備；而對設立露天座位後剩餘闊度不少於三米行人通道的申請，一般視作符合有關道路的基本要求，無需逐一審議。政府會在今年第四季推出加快審批食肆露天座位申請的「會審」制度內部指引，供部門執行。

現時不少大型活動均會提供餐飲服務。在審批相關牌照申請時，食環署和相關部門會與活動主辦者緊密溝通，因應場地和活動的實際情況，制定適合的牌照條件，一方面便利活動進行，另一方面確保食物安全、環境衞生和消防安全等。

（四）政府在《施政報告》公布將會讓食肆經營者提出申請，容許狗隻進入食肆，為業界帶來全新商機。政府會諮詢相關業界，並參考內地及海外地區的做法和經驗，制訂容許狗隻進入食肆的執行細節，當中包括獲批食肆必須明確標識，讓市民有所選擇，並須遵守指定規定和安排，務求在保障食物安全和環境衞生的同時，顧及業界和顧客的需要。

食環署預計在二○二六年年中批出首輪申請，讓一定數量的食肆容許狗隻進入。政府會留意實施情況、業界和社會的反應等，並按需要優化執行細節。"
LCQ16: Outside seating accommodation of restaurants,2025-10-08 14:25,2025-10-08 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800350.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Rock Chen and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that the Government will streamline the procedures to expedite the approval process of applications for outside seating accommodation (OSA) of restaurants and introduce a licensing arrangement allowing operators to let dogs enter their food premises. There are views that the measures relating to OSA and allowing dogs to enter food premises are conducive to the expansion of business opportunities for food premises, thereby effectively unleashing the economic vitality of the community. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of applications for OSA licences of restaurants received and approved by the Government over the past three years, as well as the average number of days for vetting and approving those applications and the success rate; the anticipated average number of working days to be shortened to in vetting and approving those applications following the introduction of measures to expedite the approval process of OSA applications; whether there are plans to introduce artificial intelligence technologies to streamline the approval process; if so, of the specific timetable for implementing such technologies;

(2) of the following information regarding restaurants approved by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department to set up OSA in the past three years: (i) the number of prosecutions in respect of contraventions relating to OSA in each year; (ii) the average amount of fine and highest penalty imposed in such prosecution cases; (iii) ‍the number of restaurants which had their restaurant licenses revoked due to contraventions relating to OSA; and (iv) the average amount of Government rent paid by restaurants for setting up OSA;

(3) while introducing measures to expedite the approval process for OSA applications of restaurants, whether it will review the clauses for setting up OSA, e.g. requiring restaurants located in areas with high daytime but low nigh-time pedestrian flows to set up OSA during night time only; whether flexible approval procedures and management standards can be put in place for OSA applications of restaurants near venues of special events, such as those organising ""a mega event in every district"", so as to stimulate the economic vitality of the community and meet the operational needs during the mega events; and

(4) of the details of the research conducted by the Government on allowing dogs to enter food premises, including whether it has examined the specific practices of allowing dogs to enter food premises in the Mainland and overseas countries and regions (e.g. the type of applicable premises, conditions for dog access, operational management regulations, health safeguards and dispute resolution mechanism); whether relevant management measures and code of practice for the licensing arrangement allowing operators to let dogs enter their food premises would be developed based on the research findings, with a view to achieving a pet-friendly community while safeguarding restaurants and public health security?

Reply:

President,

 The Government announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" that to further expedite the approval process of applications for outside seating accommodation (OSA) of restaurants, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will adopt a new way by proactively co-ordinating various relevant departments to undergo ""joint-vetting"" to resolve the matter together, and when necessary, escalate the process regarding complicated applications to the relevant Permanent Secretary or even the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration for steer, at the same time, the procedures will be streamlined. In consultation with the Lands Department, the reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Rock Chen is as follows:

(1) In the past three years, the number of applications for OSA of restaurants received by the FEHD, the processing time, cases approved and success rate are as follows:







2022
2023
2024


Number of applications
73
98
93


Approvals granted (Note 1)
37
32
63


Median processing time (months)
19
23
16


Success rate (Note 2)
41%
40%
30%



Notes:
(1) Included cases where applications were made that year or earlier but approved that year.
(2) Calculated based on the year when application was received, by dividing the number of cases received that year and approved as of August 2025 by all applications received that year (including applications later withdrawn, given up by the applicants or rejected).

The processing time of applications varies depending on the time needed for the applicant to comply with licensing requirements, handle objections from the public or relevant departments, and resolve land and other issues. It is expected that with the streamlined procedures and the ""joint-vetting"" mechanism, applications which are simple and straightforward could be approved within about a month. Relevant departments are working on the arrangements for streamlining the workflow so as to set concrete target timelines.

 The FEHD has also been actively applying AI technology in various areas of its work to enhance effectiveness, such as tackling fly-tipping and monitoring rodent infestation. It will continue to explore applying such technology in different areas of work to further enhance efficiency.

(2) In the past three years, prosecutions and fines imposed against restaurants with approved OSA due to OSA-related breaches are as follows:




Year
Number of prosecutions
Average fine ($)
Maximum fine ($)


2022
62
1,222
5,000


2023
72
1,614
6,500


2024
57
1,818
6,500




  During the same period, no restaurant licences were revoked as a result of these violations.

 Regarding land rent, for applications to set up OSA on Government land, the Lands Department or departments managing the relevant land lot will, after consulting relevant departments, generally issues land licences or short-term tenancies, based on the specific circumstances of the land use. As of end-August 2025, the relevant annual fees for approved land licences or short-term tenancies are:




Approval Type
Average Fee


Land licence
About $3.4 per square metre


Short-term tenancy
About $630 per square metre



Note: The actual fees payable for each case vary depending on the location of the land.

(3) The FEHD will coordinate relevant departments to undergo ""joint-vetting"" to resolve matter together and at the same time, streamline procedures, including adopting standardised Government rent for OSA, and allowing some applications to proceed without the requirement for increasing kitchen area and bathroom facilities. As for applications involving walkways with a remaining width of three metres or more after the provision of OSA, they will generally be considered as meeting the basic traffic requirements and do not have to be reviewed case-by-case. The Government will launch internal guidelines on the new ""joint-vetting"" mechanism to expedite applications for OSA of restaurants in Q4 2025 for implementation by departments.

 At present, many large-scale events provide catering services. When vetting relevant licence applications, the FEHD and other relevant departments will liaise closely with event organisers to develop suitable licensing conditions that take into account the venue and operational needs, so as to facilitate the events and ensure food safety, environmental hygiene and fire safety etc.

(4) The Government announced in the Policy Address that restaurant operators will be allowed to apply for permission to let dogs enter their food premises, creating new business opportunities for the industry. The Government will consult relevant trades and draw reference from practices and experiences on the Mainland and overseas, in order to formulate the implementation details of letting dogs enter food premises. Approved restaurants must display clear signage so that the public can make an informed choice, and have to comply with specified requirements and arrangements so as to balance the safeguarding of food safety and environmental hygiene, as well as the interests of the trade and consumers.

 The FEHD expects to grant permission to the first batch of applications by mid-2026, permitting a certain number of restaurants to allow dogs to enter. The Government will monitor the implementation, industry uptake and community response, and refine the details of operation as necessary."
醫務衞生局局長出席立法會接種季節性流感疫苗和新冠疫苗活動發言（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-08 13:32,2025-10-08 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800369.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（十月八日）出席立法會接種季節性流感疫苗和新冠疫苗活動發言：

梁君彥大主席（立法會主席）、各位議員、各位傳媒朋友：

很高興今日到立法會參與一年一度的約會，就是為立法會議員接種流感疫苗，同時安排接種新冠疫苗加強劑。

流行性感冒，簡稱流感，因有「感冒」二字，令很多人產生誤會，以為流行性感冒即是感冒，以為只是發燒、輕微咳嗽等小事，很快會痊癒，但大家不要誤會，流感可以引起嚴重併發症，甚至需要住院，亦有死亡個案。

接種疫苗是最有效預防流行性感冒的方法，應對普通感冒，我們不會接種疫苗；但流感可以預防，許多數據證明流感疫苗可以預防併發症、減低入院和死亡風險。

我們去年（二○二四／二五年度流感疫苗接種）做得很好，共接種超過209萬劑疫苗，較上一年度增加11.7%。這是很重要的原因，令去年的成人和兒童嚴重流感個案較新冠疫情前的流感季節分別減少兩成和六成，學校大規模爆發減少近九成。這都是因為我們有疫苗接種這個重要元素。

今年情況如何﹖我們永遠希望在健康上追求進步，不會滿足，特別是看到小朋友的嚴重併發個案可能會引致死亡，真是一宗都嫌多。今年九月才開始夏季流感季節，今年正如剛才主席所講，我們預計夏季流感與冬季流感可能會重疊，而今年自開學夏季流感季節開始，已經有超過250間學校出現群組爆發個案，有九位小朋友因出現嚴重流感併發症而入院，所以今年我們更加應該要做得更好。

政府在今年的流感疫苗接種計劃有五項優化措施，包括擴大資助範圍；優化學校外展計劃，讓家長有更多選擇；院舍方面，我們提供重組流感疫苗；我們亦首次為家庭醫生推出疫苗採購；最後亦優化資訊發放，希望可以提升疫苗接種率。

我亦很開心在此向大家報告，由九月二十二日展開疫苗接種計劃起，截至現時的最新數字，我們已經在首兩星期內共接種約33萬劑流感疫苗。大家記得去年的數字創新高，較之前增加11.7%。而今年度直至現在為止，首兩星期共接種約33萬劑流感疫苗，較去年同期再上升9.4%。我希望這個勢頭可以繼續，而我亦希望今日這個活動可以讓立法會議員幫助我們一同向大家展示接種流感疫苗其實很安全，沒有甚麼副作用，亦可以真正保護大家的健康。行政長官和一眾政府官員其實前一、兩星期已經接種了疫苗，希望議員今日接種後，市民都會積極參與。要記得︰「一年打一次，宜早不宜遲，十月最合時」。謝謝大家！"
立法會十九題：公共屋邨的紙皮石剝落問題,2025-10-08 13:20,2025-10-08 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800330.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上黃國議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

本人經常收到公共屋邨居民對樓宇外牆紙皮石剝落的投訴和求助，而據報因樓宇外牆紙皮石剝落而擊傷市民的意外亦時有發生。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）採用紙皮石作為外牆主要建築物料的公共屋邨的名單；

（二）過去三年公共屋邨紙皮石剝落的個案宗數（包括外牆、升降機大堂及走廊牆身等）及當中導致途人受傷宗數，以及該等個案所涉及的屋邨（包括大廈名稱），以及其大廈類型（例如Y型、和諧式、康和式等）、落成年份及外牆紙皮石剝落的原因為何；

（三）鑑於紙皮石剝落亦會發生在公共屋邨的升降機大堂及走廊牆身等位置，政府有否措施確保居民的出入安全，例如安排專業人士定期檢查及適時維修；

（四）會否對樓齡較高的公共屋邨（例如落成30年或以上）進行紙皮石狀況普查，以便及早進行維修工程，從而保障公眾安全；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）公共屋邨樓宇牆身（包括外牆、升降機大堂及走廊牆身等）採用紙皮石物料的主要原因為何；會否考慮減少採用紙皮石，並選擇其他同樣美觀、實用但更為安全的建築物料？

答覆:

主席：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）一直非常重視樓宇安全，透過日常巡查及多項勘察和維修計劃，讓公共屋邨得到適時妥善維修，以保持良好狀況。

就黃國議員的提問，我們現回覆如下：

（一）現時房委會轄下有128個公共屋邨有採用紙皮石作為外牆建築飾面物料，有關公共租住屋邨（屋邨）的資料請參閱附件一。

（二）房屋署會每日巡視屋邨的公用地方及設施的狀況，包括升降機大堂及走廊等，保持設施安全及環境衞生。當巡視時發現有設施需要維修（例如紙皮石剝落）或收到居民反映後，房屋署均會即時安排維修。根據紀錄，由二○二二年一月一日至二○二五年八月三十一日，合共有23宗外牆紙皮石剝落個案，其中三宗個案涉及途人受輕傷。屋邨辦事處已即時作出跟進，包括圍封有關通道、檢視外牆其他部分及安排維修，所有個案已完成修繕。一般而言，外牆紙皮石會因老化或環境因素（例如溫度及濕度變化）影響而出現剝落，惟不會影響大廈的整體樓宇結構。就上述涉及外牆紙皮石剝落的個案資料，請參閱附件二。

（三）及（四）房屋署一直透過日常巡視和專業的保養維修計劃，勘察全港屋邨的樓宇，並會因應樓宇年期和結構狀況等，適時安排勘察或維修，以保持樓宇結構穩固安全，為住戶提供安全舒適的居住環境。相關工作主要如下：

（i）日常巡查：涵蓋所有樓齡的屋邨樓宇，前線同事每日巡視屋邨內的樓宇和公共設施，適時跟進需要進行維修的項目；

（ii）年度保養巡查：屋邨每年均會進行年度檢視，制定年度保養項目，包括檢查和維護公共設施（防火門、地台瓦、外牆等）、裝備（升降機、消防設備、管道等），以提升效能和安全水平；

（iii）全方位維修計劃：主動勘察樓齡達10年或以上的公屋單位的室內狀況，在勘察室內狀況時，亦會同時留意公屋單位附近外牆的狀況，如發現外牆有需要維修，會作出適當跟進。此舉不但提升租戶的居住環境質素，同時延長公屋單位使用年期；

（iv）外牆勘察維修：針對樓齡較高的屋邨樓宇（例如約30年以上），房屋署會按需要安排外牆檢查及修葺，提升外牆的安全和耐用度；及

（v）全面結構勘察計劃：針對樓齡接近或超過40年的公屋進行詳細的結構安全評估，以確定這些高樓齡公屋的結構安全，並評估透過修葺和結構鞏固等工程，持續保存該等樓宇15年或以上的可行性及經濟效益。

除了以上巡查及勘察工作外，房屋署積極尋求應用創新科技以縮短勘察時間及提高成效。房屋署現時不但會在勘察時使用手提紅外線熱成像攝影機，有需要時更會運用配備影像拍攝及紅外線熱成像功能的小型無人機進行樓宇外牆勘察，結合人工智能分析平台自動識別外牆缺陷，例如紙皮石脫落等，生成風險評估報告以標記需優先處理項目，有效提升預防性維護的效率，整體成效顯著。另外，房屋署大約每10年為屋邨進行大廈粉飾工程，在粉飾工程進行前，亦會為大廈外牆進行全面檢查及維修。

（五）房委會一直為新建的公營房屋訂立一套合適的建屋規格及標準。這些規格及標準會因應新的建造技術、建築物料、作業守則等而更新。在70及80年代興建的香港建築物，包括當時房委會的公共屋邨，都會選用紙皮石作為飾面。大約自二○一○年起，房委會的公營房屋採用了更簡約設計。因此，公共屋邨住宅大樓外牆、樓層走廊及升降機大堂牆身飾面主要採用漆料，而大堂設計上部份飾面會加入瓷磚。由於紙皮石富有多樣的色彩，能拼砌不同的圖案，故仍會小量應用於項目的公共空間特色牆作為點綴。"
LCQ19: Spalling of mosaic tiles in public housing estates,2025-10-08 13:20,2025-10-08 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800331.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kingsley Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  I often receive complaints and requests for assistance from residents of public housing estates (PHEs) about the spalling of mosaic tiles on the external walls of buildings, and it was reported that there were occasional accidents of members of the public being injured by spalled mosaic tiles detaching from the external walls of buildings. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the list of PHEs where mosaic tiles have been used as a major building material for external walls;

(2) of the number of cases of mosaic tiles spalling (on external walls, walls of lift lobbies and corridors, etc) in PHEs over the past three years and, among such cases, the number of those resulting in injuries to passers-by, as well as the estates involved in such cases (including the names of blocks) and their block types (e.g. Trident, Harmony, and Concord), their years of completion, and the causes of the spalling of mosaic tiles on the external walls;

(3) given that the spalling of mosaic tiles will also occur at locations such as walls of lift lobbies and corridors in PHEs, whether the Government has measures in place to ensure the safe entry and exit of residents, such as arranging professionals to carry out regular checks and timely repairs;

(4) whether it will conduct a general survey on the conditions of mosaic tiles in older PHEs (e.g. those aged 30 years or above) to facilitate early repair works, thereby safeguarding public safety; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) of the main reasons for using mosaic tiles as a material for the walls of buildings (including external walls, walls of lift lobbies and corridors) in PHEs; whether it will consider reducing the use of mosaic tiles and choosing other building materials that are equally aesthetic and practical but safer?

Reply:

President,

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has always placed great emphasis on building safety. Through daily inspections and various inspection and maintenance programmes, public housing estates receive timely and proper maintenance and repairs to ensure they remain in good condition.

  In response to the question raised by the Hon Kingsley Wong, our reply is as follows:

(1) Currently, there are 128 public housing estates under the HA using mosaic tiles as the exterior wall finishing materials. Please refer to Annex I.

(2) The Housing Department (HD) conducts daily inspections of the common areas and facilities within public housing estates, including lift lobbies and corridors, to maintain facility safety and environmental hygiene. Upon identifying facilities requiring maintenance during inspections (such as spalling of mosaic tiles) or receiving reports from tenants, the HD would promptly arrange repairs. According to our records, there were a total of 23 cases of spalling of mosaic tiles on the external walls, with three cases involving minor injuries to pedestrians from January 1, 2022 to August 31, 2025. The estate offices took immediate follow-up actions, including cordoning off the affected passageways, inspecting other sections of the external walls, and arranging repairs. All cases were fully resolved. In general, mosaic tiles on external wall may spall due to ageing or environmental factors, such as change in temperature and humidity, but this does not affect the overall structural integrity of the building. For details of the aforementioned cases involving spalling of mosaic tiles from external wall, please refer to Annex II.

(3) and (4) The HD has been conducting daily inspections and implementing professional maintenance and repair programmes across all public housing estates in Hong Kong. Based on factors such as the age and structural condition of buildings, timely inspections and repairs are arranged to ensure structural integrity and safety, thereby providing residents with a secure and comfortable living environment. The relevant work mainly includes the following:

(i) Daily Inspections: Covering all public housing estates regardless of building age, frontline staff conduct daily inspections of buildings and communal facilities, following up on items requiring repair in a timely manner;

(ii) Annual Technical Inspection: Each estate undergoes an annual review to establish a yearly maintenance plan, which includes inspection and upkeep of public facilities (e.g. fire doors, floor tiles, external walls, etc) and equipment (e.g. lifts, fire safety installations, pipelines, etc) to enhance efficiency and safety standards;

(iii) Total Maintenance Scheme: Proactive inspections are conducted for public rental housing aged 10 years or above. During these inspections, attention is also given to the condition of external walls near the flats. If external wall repairs are identified, appropriate follow-up actions will be taken. This approach not only improves tenants' living environment, but also extends the service life of the flats;

(iv) External Wall Finishes Repair Programme: For older public housing estates (e.g. those aged 30 years or above), the HD arranges external wall inspections and repairs as needed to enhance the safety and durability of external walls; and

(v) Comprehensive Structural Investigation Programme: Detailed structural safety assessments are conducted for public housing estates approaching or exceeding 40 years of age. These assessments verify the structural safety and evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of preserving these buildings for at least 15 years or more through repairs and structural strengthening works.

  In addition to the above inspection and survey works, the HD actively explores the application of innovative technologies to shorten inspection time and enhance effectiveness. The HD currently uses handheld infrared thermographic cameras during inspections and, when necessary, deploys small drones equipped with imaging and infrared thermographic capabilities to examine building exteriors. These drones integrate with an artificial intelligence analysis platform to automatically identify external wall defects, such as spalling of mosaic tiles, and generate risk assessment reports to prioritise items requiring attention. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency of preventive maintenance with notable overall results. Furthermore, the HD carries out comprehensive external wall inspections and repairs approximately every ten years prior to its building redecorating works.

(5) The HA has consistently established a set of appropriate construction standards and specifications for new public housing developments. These standards and specifications are regularly updated in response to advancement of new construction technologies, building materials, and latest codes of practice. Buildings constructed in Hong Kong during the 1970s and 1980s, including public housing estates developed by the HA at that time, were commonly constructed with mosaic tiles as finishing material. Since around 2010, the HA has adopted a cleaner design for public housing. Consequently, the external walls, corridors and lift lobby walls of residential blocks in public housing estates are mainly finished with paint, while ceramic tiles are incorporated into the lobby design. Given the diverse colours of mosaic tiles and their applicability to different patterns, mosaic tiles continue to be used occasionally for feature walls in public spaces of housing projects as a highlight."

房委會的既定政策是在切實可行的情況下，遵從《設計手冊：暢通無阻的通道》（《設計手冊》）的現行規定，提供無障礙通道和設施。因應《設計手冊1997》和《設計手冊2008》的推出，房委會已分別在二○○一年和二○一○年為房委會轄下於《設計手冊》推出前落成的物業進行必要的無障礙設施改善工程。這些改善工程包括鋪設斜道、在通道安裝合適的扶手、鋪設及擴建觸覺引路徑接連屋邨主要入口至屋邨範圍內的主要設施和住宅大廈的出入口等。但個別樓宇或會因不同限制，例如樓宇設計，而未能完全加裝相關設施或進行改建。至於所有在二○○八年十二月一日後動工興建的新房委會建築物，及當一些現有房委會建築物需進行改建或加建工程時，在切實可行的情況下，均會按照《設計手冊2008》所載的強制規定來規劃及開展工程。因應居民的不同需求，房委會亦會作出靈活安排，例如我們現時正為坪石邨、禾輋邨及沙角邨等高樓齡公共屋邨額外加建斜道，以連接邨內主要屋邨設施，便利居民進出。房委會在新建的公共屋邨已採用「通用設計」的概念，以締造傷健一家、和諧共融的生活環境。

另外，為加強屋邨無障礙事宜的統籌工作，房委會自二○一一年起推出無障礙統籌經理和無障礙主任計劃，於各公共屋邨的無障礙主任會負責協助有需要的人士使用邨內的無障礙通道及設施。

除了在公用地方提供無障礙設施外，長者或殘疾人士如有實際需要，亦可向房委會申請改裝單位內的設施。房委會會參考醫生、物理治療師、職業治療師或醫務社工等人士的建議，免費為相關租戶進行調適工程。這些工程包括在可行情況下在單位入口設置斜道、擴闊浴室門口、在適當地面鋪設防滑地磚等。如租戶只要求在浴室加裝扶手或將浴缸改裝成淋浴間，房委會一般可以直接為租戶免費安排有關工程，無需取得醫生或物理治療師的建議。

香港房屋協會（房協）方面，為應對轄下出租屋邨及其居民「雙老化」的挑戰，房協持續投放資源進行大型改善工程，以提升大廈及屋邨公共地方的暢達度及增加無障礙設施，例如加裝升降機及轉乘電梯、設置電動爬梯機，以及興建升降機大樓及接駁天橋等。此外，房協過去十年已先後為轄下高樓齡的出租屋邨完成更換超過七十部升降機，並計劃陸續為其他合適的高樓齡公共屋邨進行更換升降機工程。未來，房協會繼續檢視轄下公共屋邨的狀況，研究在可行及合適的情況下加入和優化無障礙通道或設施。

（二）房協轄下的樂民新村共有11幢大廈，於一九七○至一九七三年分期落成，其中六幢大廈（即A座至F座）由低至高依山而建，而F座位處的地勢較高。為方便居民出入，房協已於二○一四年完成興建轉乘升降機大樓及連接F座的行人天橋，並加建有蓋行人通道，居民可於F座樓下的靠背壟道平路出入口乘搭升降機上F座，然後向下行前往A座至E座，而毋須經靠背壟道的屋邨正門上坡而行。

現時A座至E座的居民仍需經過一些樓梯方可到達各座門口。就此，房協已委聘工程顧問公司，現正就於A座至E座合適位置增設無障礙通道（如斜道或升降機）進行可行性研究，包括考慮現場的岩土地質及有關工程對現有居民生活作息的影響等因素。

此外，房協亦已委託初創企業研發相關的房地產科技方案，以協助居民在樓梯搬運一些例如糧油白米等與日常生活有關的重物，進一步加強支援居民。

就公共屋邨內的各項設施，房委會和房協會繼續與地方社區團體／人士、以及公共屋邨內的居民積極溝通和進行研究，探討優化方向，以照顧公共屋邨內不同人士，包括長者和殘疾人士等的需要。"

LCQ1: Preventing students from falling victim to scams and pitfalls,2025-10-08 12:48,2025-10-08 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800341.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Duncan Chiu and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

It is reported that according to the latest figures from the Police, there were 327 telephone scam cases involving Mainland students last year, resulting in an aggregate loss exceeding $230 million. On average, each student victim was defrauded of over $700,000. Furthermore, a recent case involved a Hong Kong university student from the Mainland who is suspected to have suffered a financial loss after falling victim to a telephone scam involving the impersonation of government officials, before subsequently jumping to her death. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information regarding scam cases involving students in the first nine months of this year: (i) the number of telephone and cyber scam cases involving local, Mainland and overseas students, (ii) the total amount of money defrauded, along with the highest individual amount, and (iii) the main countries or regions of origin of the overseas students who fell victim to these scams;

(2) whether it has conducted an analysis of telephone and cyber scam cases involving students, including the deception tactics employed by fraudsters and the communication software or social networking platforms involved; if so, of the findings of such analysis and the countermeasures that the authorities will adopt, including whether they will work with local commercial entities, such as mobile network and social networking platform operators, to introduce enhanced measures to prevent students from falling victim to telephone and cyber scams and pitfalls; if so, the specific details;

(3) whether it will consult with various local universities and formulate effective measures to strengthen awareness of telephone and cyber scam prevention among local, Mainland and overseas students, including requiring students to attend designated seminars on scam prevention and pass relevant assessments upon admission; and

(4) whether the authorities have reviewed the current anti-scam promotional efforts and their effectiveness in kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and universities, with a view to enhancing young people's awareness of and capability in scam prevention; whether the authorities have set specific targets to determine which anti-scam initiatives require further enhancement and updating, and formulated a timetable for implementing various enhancement measures?

Reply:

President,

Deception is a serious crime. Any person who commits the offence of ""fraud"" under Section 16A of the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) is liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years, while any person charged with ""obtaining property by deception"" under Section 17 of the same Ordinance is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years. In addition, any person charged with ""dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" under Section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) for proceeds of deception is liable to maximum penalties of 14 years' imprisonment and a fine of $5 million.

In consultation with the Education Bureau (EDB), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) According to the latest figures from the Police, there were a total of 28 379 scam cases, involving monetary loss of $5.02 billion, in the first eight months of 2025, which represent a decrease of 1 per cent and 14.5 per cent respectively when compared with the same period last year. Among them, there were 184 and 86 telephone scam cases involving local and Mainland students of tertiary institutions. The monetary losses incurred were approximately $32 million and $75 million respectively. The Police do not maintain statistical figures on the number of cyber scam cases involving students. Furthermore, as the Police do not observe an evident trend of scams targeting overseas students at this stage, a statistical breakdown is not maintained.

The case with the highest amount of loss was a telephone scam in April 2025 involving impersonation of government officials, resulting in a loss of over $10 million. The victim, a 25-year-old university student from the Mainland, followed the instructions of fraudsters by making multiple deposits totalling $10.97 million into a number of designated local bank accounts during the period between April and July 2025. In July of the same year, the Police arrested two Mainland males, who were subsequently charged with three counts of money laundering.

(2) The Police have been analysing the latest trends and intelligence of telephone and cyber scams involving students, and have been regularly releasing the latest anti-scam messages. For example, the Police make use of press conferences, social media accounts of the Police and platforms such as the CyberDefender website to warn students and the public about the latest scam tactics.

It has come to the Police's attention that recently many students have become victims of telephone scams involving fake food delivery platforms sending phishing SMS messages, instructing victims to call a fake ""customer service"" and then tricking them into paying ""guarantee money"" to cancel orders. As regards cyber scams, scam syndicates have been luring students into participating in fake ""click farming"" tasks through social media groups including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The Anti-Deception Coordination Centre (ADCC) of the Police has immediately stepped up dissemination of anti-scam alerts on websites and social media platforms, urging the public not to call back by clicking on the telephone numbers provided in the SMS messages. If in doubt, they should contact the official customer service centre of the food delivery platforms for verification. They are also encouraged to make good use of the Police's ""Scameter+"" and ""Anti-Scam Helpline"".

To heighten the alertness of students and the public against telephone and online scams and pitfalls, the Police have been maintaining close communication and collaboration with telecommunications service providers (TSP) and social media platform operators. In particular, anti-scam promotional leaflets are distributed through TSPs. The promotional materials are updated from time to time, so as to remind members of the public to be watchful over the latest scam tactics. Should suspected fraudulent content be found, the Police will request the social media platforms concerned to immediately remove the content and take appropriate follow-up actions. From January to August of 2025, the platforms concerned have reviewed and removed over 67 000 items of fraudulent content at the request of the Police. In addition, the Police held a joint press conference with Meta, the parent company of Facebook and WhatsApp, in August 2025 to alert the public of the latest scam tactics involving messaging applications and social networking platforms. The public were also notified of the operators' anti-scam countermeasures, which include the strengthened use of artificial intelligence technology for detecting and removing fraudulent content and accounts.

(3) The EDB and the University Grants Committee have been encouraging tertiary institutions to promote anti-scam information to students through various channels and provide students with appropriate support. To raise the anti-scam awareness and vigilance of local, Mainland and overseas students, institutions have provided them with scam prevention and anti-scam information through channels such as seminars for parents, admission briefings, dedicated webpages and dedicated hotlines.

Mainland students are more prone to become scam victims because they are unfamiliar with Hong Kong's systems, fraud situation and ways of seeking help. In this connection, the Commissioner of Police has earlier on sent a letter to the newly arrived students and their parents via all tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, urging them to pay particular attention to several common scam tactics and advising them of ways to guard against scams. They are also encouraged to make good use of the Police's ""Anti-Scam Helpline"" and ""Scameter+"". Earlier on, in collaboration with the National Immigration Administration, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and the Immigration Department of Hong Kong, the Police have produced anti-scam video clips showing the modus operandi of fraudsters. Starting from June 2025, the videos are broadcast across boundary control points, exit-entry service halls in the Mainland as well as social media platforms including Xiaohongshu and Douyin. The Police also collaborated with the Chinese Service Center for Scholarly Exchange to organise sharing sessions in the Mainland, sharing anti-scam knowledge with over 11 000 students coming to Hong Kong for studies and their parents. Furthermore, the Police have disseminated anti-scam information to students through activities and seminars organised jointly with Mainland students' groups in various institutions.

The Police have also launched an online learning package. Local, Mainland and overseas students will have to learn about scam tactics and be given advice on countermeasures through the tutorials in the forms of texts, images and videos. They will then have to complete the multiple choice questions provided. Those who have passed the test will receive an e-certificate. To cope with the peak of scams involving students around the new academic year of 2025, the Police have launched an updated version of the online learning questionnaire in traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese and English, covering scam tactics such as telephone deception, investment fraud and employment fraud, as well as information provided by the ADCC of the Police. A number of institutions in Hong Kong have required local, Mainland and overseas students to complete the learning package or questionnaire within specified time frames in the new academic year in order to gain access to campus facilities (such as libraries and learning commons).

Furthermore, the Police organised over 30 scam prevention educational seminars and activities around the start of the new academic year, which have attracted the participation of more than 4 000 local, Mainland and overseas students. The activities included stepping up promotion of the online learning package and arranging visits to tertiary institutions by the Quby themed anti-scam promotional truck to disseminate anti-scam messages to students and staff.

The Police have collaborated with an institution to conduct a survey on the awareness of scam among university students. Of the 3 000-odd replies collected, it was found that nearly 85 per cent of the respondents had enrolled in the anti-scam online learning package. For students who had completed the learning package, the number who fell prey to scams and suffered monetary loss were 58 percentage points lower than those who had never enrolled in the learning package. The Police will continue to encourage the participation of local, Mainland and overseas students of tertiary institutions.

(4) In keeping with societal changes and technology development, the EDB continues to review and optimise the school curriculum. Learning elements relating to media and information literacy education as well as anti-scam awareness have been incorporated into primary and secondary school curricula. For example, Primary Humanities, Junior Secondary Citizenship, Economics and Society, and Senior Secondary Citizenship and Social Development have all included learning contents of information literacy, prudence in analysing the authenticity of information, handling of personal data, as well as guarding against cyber pitfalls and risks. This helps students to develop critical thinking and enhance their self protection awareness. In addition, the Information Literacy for Hong Kong Students, a learning framework provided to schools by the EDB, helps enrich the information literacy-related learning elements in the school curriculum, through which students are encouraged to use the Internet in a healthy manner, safeguard their personal privacy and equip themselves with fact checking skills, thereby enhancing their anti-scam awareness and ability.

To deepen teachers' knowledge of technology crime information and data security, enabling them to guide students in the safe and proper use of Internet, the EDB continuously launches professional development programmes for teachers and supports the promotion of information literacy education in schools. The EDB also organises seminars for parents, helping them nurture their children's ethical use of innovative technology in their everyday life, such as properly protecting personal privacy and developing good habits in using information technology.

To raise the awareness and capability of kindergarteners and young people of primary and secondary schools in scam prevention, the EDB and the Police have jointly designed teaching materials to enhance students' safety awareness in using new technology, which helps them avoid falling prey to scams. Among others, the Police have published the Youth Crime Prevention Booklet for four years in a row starting from 2022, offering a set of practical tools for teachers and parents to educate students about the common crimes and ways to deal with them.

The Police have also published the educational comic booklets titled ""The Dirty Money Trap"" and ""Black and White"" for two consecutive years, explaining the money laundering pitfalls associated with ""renting, borrowing and selling of bank accounts"". A dedicated chapter titled ""Tips for Teachers and Parents"" is also featured, offering practical guidance to help teachers and parents identify signs of young people's involvement in such crimes. To keep parents informed of the latest modus operandi and trends of cyber pitfalls, the Police regularly publish ""Letters to Parents"" on the ""CyberDefender"" website. Using real-life examples, these letters explain high-risk cyber pitfalls that young people and children may encounter and offer advice to parents, hence enhancing their capability in recognising and coping with cyber pitfalls.

In addition, the Police have introduced an anti-scam mascot ""The Little Grape"" since 2020 to explain the latest tactics of fraudsters and disseminate simple anti-scam messages in a friendly and interactive manner. Anti-scam information is also posted on different social media platforms using ""The Little Grape"" as the theme, such as ""The Little Grape"" Animation Picture book. Also, through offline interaction between ""The Little Grape"" and primary and secondary students, such as visits to primary and secondary schools by ""The Little Grape"" and the anti-scam promotional vehicle, anti-scam messages are conveyed to young people. A picture book named ""The Little Grape and Me: Beware of fraudsters"" targeting kindergarteners has also been released, with copies distributed to nearly 1 000 kindergartens across the territory with a view to cultivating anti-scam awareness in young children.

Going forward, the Government will continue to collaborate with kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, tertiary institutions and stakeholders. Stakeholders' views are collected regularly through various channels to provide feedback on curriculum planning and implementation, with a view to strengthening students' awareness in scam prevention. In response to the advancing technology and evolving tactics of fraudsters, the Government will analyse the latest scam landscape and intelligence in an ongoing manner, and will review and adjust our anti-scam work as necessary."
​立法會一題：預防學生誤墮詐騙陷阱,2025-10-08 12:48,2025-10-08 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800328.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上邱達根議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據報根據警方最新數字，去年涉及內地學生的電話詐騙案共有327宗，損失總金額超過2億3,000萬元，平均每名學生被騙超過70萬元，此外近日有來自內地的本港大學生懷疑因誤墮假冒官員的電話騙局而蒙受損失，繼而跳樓輕生。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）今年首九個月涉及學生的騙案的以下資料：(i)涉及本地、內地和海外學生的電話及網絡詐騙案宗數、(ii)涉及總金額和最高被騙金額，以及(iii)被騙海外學生主要來自哪些國家和地區；

（二）有否分析涉及學生的電話及網絡詐騙案，包括騙徒的行騙手法、涉及哪些通訊軟件或社交網絡平台等；若有，分析結果為何，以及當局將採取甚麼應對措施，包括會否聯同本地流動網絡及社交網絡平台營辦商等商業機構，推出加強防範學生誤墮電話及網絡詐騙陷阱的措施；若會，具體詳情為何；

（三）會否與本港各大學商討及制訂有效措施，以加強本地及海內外留學生對電話及網絡詐騙的防範意識，包括要求學生在入學時必須參與指定的防騙講座，並需通過相關考核等；及

（四）為提高青少年的防騙意識和能力，當局有否檢視現時在幼稚園、中小學及大學推廣防騙工作和成效；當局有否制訂具體目標，以釐定哪些防騙工作需要進一步優化和更新，以及推行各項優化措施的時間表？

答覆：

主席︰

詐騙乃嚴重罪行。任何人干犯《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）第16A條「欺詐罪」，最高可判處監禁14年；若被控同一條例第17條「以欺騙手段取得財產」，最高可判處監禁10年。另外，任何人因詐騙得益而被控《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）第25條「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」，最高可判處監禁14年及罰款500萬元。

就議員的提問，經諮詢教育局後，現回覆如下：

（一）根據警方最新數字，二○二五年首八個月共接獲28 379宗騙案，損失金額為50.2億元，較去年同期分別下跌1%及14.5%；當中涉及專上院校本地學生和內地學生的電話騙案分別為184宗及86宗，損失金額分別約為3,200萬元及7,500萬元。警方未有就學生涉及網絡詐騙的個案數字作分類備存。此外，警方暫時未觀察到針對海外學生的騙案有明顯趨勢，因此沒有就此作分類統計。

損失金額最高一宗發生於二○二五年四月的假冒官員電話騙案，損失超過1,000萬港元。受害人為一名25歲內地大學生，於二○二五年四月至七月期間按騙徒指示將1,097萬元分多次存入多個指定的本地銀行帳戶。警方於同年七月拘捕兩名內地男子，並已起訴兩人共三項「洗黑錢」罪。

（二）警方持續分析最新涉及學生的電話及網絡詐騙案形勢及情報，並定期發放最新的防騙信息，包括透過記者會、警隊官方社交媒體帳號、守網者網站等平台向學生及公眾介紹最新騙案手法。

警方注意到近來涉及學生的電話騙案多涉及假冒外賣平台發送釣魚短訊，指示受害人致電「假客服」，再誘騙其支付保證金以取消訂單。至於網絡詐騙案方面，不少詐騙集團透過Facebook、Instagram、WhatsApp等平台，誘使學生參與虛假的「刷單」活動。警方反詐騙協調中心即時加強在網站及相關社交媒體平台發出防騙警示，呼籲公眾切勿回撥短訊內的電話，如有懷疑應聯繫外賣平台的官方客戶服務中心核實，並鼓勵他們善用警方的「防騙視伏App」及「防騙易熱線」。

為加強防範學生及公眾誤墮電話及網絡詐騙陷阱，警方一直與電訊服務及社交媒體平台營辦商保持緊密溝通合作，包括透過電訊商派發防騙宣傳單張，並會不時更新防騙宣傳材料，提醒市民防範最新騙案手法。如發現有懷疑詐騙內容，警方會要求有關社交媒體平台即時移除，並採取適當的跟進行動。二○二五年一月至八月，有關平台已按警方要求，檢視及移除超過67 000個詐騙內容。另外，警方於二○二五年八月與Facebook及WhatsApp的母公司Meta舉行聯合記者會，發布涉及通訊軟件及社交網絡平台的最新騙案手法，以及營辦商的反詐措施，包括加強使用人工智能技術偵測和移除詐騙內容及帳號。

（三）教育局及大學教育資助委員會一直鼓勵各院校透過不同渠道向學生推廣防騙資訊，並為學生提供適當的支援。為提高本地、內地及海外學生的防騙意識和警覺性，各院校透過舉辦家長講座、入學簡介會、設立資訊專頁和專責熱線等提供防騙及反詐騙的資料。

有見及內地學生因為不熟悉本港的制度、騙案情況、求助方法等，較容易成為騙徒的目標，警務處處長早前已透過全港大專院校去信新來港學生及其家長，呼籲特別留意及防範常見的騙案手法，並鼓勵他們善用警方「防騙易熱線」及「防騙視伏App」。警方早前亦與國家移民管理局、公安部刑事偵查局及香港入境事務處共同製作防騙視頻，展示騙徒常用的犯案手法，並自二○二五年六月起在各口岸、內地出入境辦證大廳，以及小紅書、抖音等社交媒體播放。警方亦與國家教育部留學服務中心協作，在內地舉辦多場分享會，向超過11 000名留學生及家長講解防騙資訊。此外，警方與不同院校的內地生團體合辦活動和講座，以及透過他們發放防騙資訊。

警方亦已推出「網上學習套件」，本地、內地及海外學生須觀看圖文和影片教學，了解騙案手法和應對建議，回答多項選擇題，及格者可獲發電子證書。為應對二○二五年新學年前後學生騙案的高峰期，警方已推出新版網上學習問卷，備有繁體中文、簡體中文及英文版本，涵蓋電話騙案、投資騙案、求職騙案手法和警方反詐騙協調中心資訊。香港多間院校已要求本地、內地及海外學生於新學年必須按時完成該學習套件或問卷方可使用校園設施（如圖書館和學習空間）。

此外，警方於新學年前後舉辦超過30場防騙教育講座和活動，吸引超過4 000名本地、內地及海外學生參與，當中包括加強宣傳網上學習套件，並安排「乖巧寶寶防騙主題車」走訪專上院校，向學生及教職員傳遞防騙信息等。

警方早前與個別院校合作進行有關大學生詐騙認知的調查，收集逾3 000份回覆，發現近85%受訪者曾參與「網上學習套件」，而曾完成該學習套件的學生遭遇詐騙而有金錢損失的比率比未曾參與者低58個百分點。警方會繼續鼓勵專上院校的本地、內地及海外學生參與。

（四）因應社會的轉變和資訊科技的發展，教育局持續檢視和優化課程，與媒體和資訊素養教育和防騙意識相關的學習元素均蘊含在中小學的課程中，例如小學人文科、初中公民、經濟與社會科和高中公民與社會發展科課程均包含資訊素養、謹慎辨析資訊真偽和處理個人資料，以及防範網絡陷阱和風險等學習內容，幫助學生學會慎思明辨，提升自我保護意識。此外，教育局亦為學校提供《香港學生資訊素養》學習架構，以加強學校課程中與資訊素養相關的學習元素，推動學生健康地使用互聯網、保護個人私隱及裝備他們事實查證的技巧，提高學生的防騙意識和能力。

為加強教師對科技罪案資訊、數據保安的認識，指導學生安全及正確使用互聯網，教育局持續提供教師專業發展課程，支援學校推動資訊素養教育。教育局亦舉辦家長講座，協助家長培養子女在日常生活合乎道德地使用創新科技，包括懂得保護個人私隱，養成運用資訊科技的良好習慣。

針對幼稚園及中小學的青少年防騙意識和能力方面，教育局與警方協作編製教材，以提升學生在應用新興科技時的安全意識，避免誤墮陷阱。其中，警方自二○二二年起連續四年出版《青少年罪行誌．師長攻略》，為教師及家長提供一套實用的工具教導學生常見罪行及應對方法。

警方亦連續兩年出版教育漫畫特刊《黑金陷阱》及《黑白分明》，講解「租、借、賣戶口」的洗黑錢陷阱，並提供「師長攻略」專章，提供實用指引協助師長識別青少年涉案的徵兆。為了讓家長掌握最新的網絡陷阱手法和趨勢，警方定期透過「守網者」網頁推出「給家長的信」，以真實案例講解青少年和兒童可能面對的高危網絡陷阱，並向家長提供建議，以提升辨識及應對網絡陷阱的能力。

此外，警方自二○二○年起推出防騙吉祥物「提子」，以親民互動的方式解釋騙徒的最新犯案手法及提供簡單易明的防騙信息，並在各社交媒體平台上發布以「提子」為題的防騙資訊，如《提子動畫廊》繪本等，亦安排「提子」在線下與青少年及中、小學生互動，以宣揚防騙信息，包括安排「提子入校園」，並以防騙宣傳車走訪中小學校園。警方亦推出以幼兒為對象的《提子與我：提防騙子》繪本，向全港近1 000間幼稚園派發，幫助小童從小建立防騙意識。

未來，政府將繼續聯同幼稚園、中小學、專上院校及相關持份者合作，並會持續透過不同渠道，收集不同持份者的意見，以回饋課程策劃和實施，加強學生的防騙意識。科技日新月異，騙徒的手法層出不窮，政府將持續分析最新騙案形勢及情報，並按需要檢視和調整我們的反詐工作。"
Hong Kong Customs teams up with Mainland and Macao Customs to combat cross-boundary counterfeit goods transshipment activities (with photo),2025-10-08 12:30,2025-10-08 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800340.htm,"âHong Kong Customs conducted an enforcement operation with the Mainland and Macao Customs from September 15 to 30, during which inspections of goods across the three places and destined for America, Europe, Japan and Korea were stepped up to combat cross-boundary and transshipment counterfeiting activities. During the operation, Hong Kong Customs detected 18 cases and seized about 45 000 suspected counterfeit goods, including watches, handbags, footwear and fragrances, with a total estimated market value of about $21 million.

Through intelligence analyses and thorough investigations, Hong Kong Customs in the operation detected 15 related cases at a number of local express couriers and logistics companies.

Meanwhile, Customs officers detected three cases at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port, seizing a batch of suspected counterfeit goods from three incoming lorries. Three male lorry drivers, aged between 41 and 61, were arrested. An investigation is ongoing. The three arrestees have been released on bail pending further investigation.

Hong Kong Customs will continue to work closely with the Mainland Customs, Macao Customs and overseas law enforcement agencies to vigorously combat cross-boundary counterfeit goods transshipping activities through intelligence exchanges and joint enforcement actions.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who imports or exports any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

問題：

二○二五年《施政報告》提出措施以確保本地勞工優先就業。另一方面，政府自今年六月三十日起，在一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃下新增渠道，容許符合技術專才清單資格的人士來港從事八項人手短缺的技術工種。然而，有意見指出相關安排或對本地勞工的就業機會造成負面影響。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於二○二五年《施政報告》提出收緊補充勞工優化計劃（優化計劃）下侍應生及初級廚師的人手比例要求（即全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例為二比一），將現時以僱主所有申請職位為基礎的計算方式，改為按個別申請職位計算，政府有否統計，在現行優化計劃的人手比例要求下，本地勞工在個別工種所佔的比例為何；有否發現僱主透過聘用不同工種或以兼職形式聘用本地勞工以達到優化計劃的人手比例要求；若有發現有關情況，政府現行的監察機制及改善措施為何；

（二）會否考慮將第（一）項所述的收緊人手比例要求的安排擴展至更多職位類別，並研究禁止僱主利用兼職形式聘用本地勞工以達到人手比例要求；

（三）鑑於二○二五年《施政報告》提出加大力度打擊非法勞工，包括設立舉報專線及推動更多跨部門聯合行動，政府就上述措施的具體計劃及預期成效為何；

（四）據悉近年有不法分子透過社交平台（例如小紅書）招攬生意後安排黑工來港提供服務，並安排黑工於隱蔽地點工作，過去一年政府就打擊非法勞工共進行了多少次突擊巡查，以及該等執法行動的成效為何，包括該等行動中被捕的非法勞工及僱主數目，以及提出的檢控宗數為何；

（五）就上述技術專才清單所新增的八項技術工種，至今各工種的申請人數及已批出配額分別為何；有否計劃根據本地培訓進度及人力供應情況，動態調整各工種配額；如否，會否考慮設立可加可減機制，以避免配額過多並保障本地技術人員就業；及

答覆：

主席：

政府的人力政策一直以培育本地人才為主，引入外來人才為輔。面對產業轉型及人口持續高齡化，政府自二○二二年底推出多項「搶人才」措施，壯大本地人才庫。政府亦在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，於二○二三年加強輸入勞工的機制，為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃，並推行補充勞工優化計劃（優化計劃），適度容許僱主確實未能在本地聘得合適人手時申請輸入勞工。根據《入境條例》（第115章），這些輸入勞工在港期間不會被視為通常居於香港，因此他們不會憑藉輸入勞工身分在港逗留而獲得香港永久性居民身分。政府一直密切監察就業市場的情況，適時及針對性地調整輸入勞工的執行安排，並大力打擊非法勞工，確保本地工人優先就業及維持人力供應，以支持香港的經濟發展。

二○二五年，政府針對人力極短缺的指定技術工種在一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃下新增渠道，容許年輕及具經驗的非學位專才來港，補充本地勞動力。經這兩個渠道來港的職業專才可累積在港居住年數，日後如符合《入境條例》訂明的相關資格可申請成為香港永久性居民，因此與輸入勞工有本質上的區別，不宜混為一談。

就議員的提問，經諮詢保安局及政府統計處後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）優化計劃規定，申請輸入勞工的僱主必須符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例（人手比例），一般須已聘用兩名全職本地僱員，方可獲准輸入一名勞工。全職僱員是指僱主直接僱用而每周總工作時數不少於35小時以經營相關業務的所有本地僱員，不包括兼職僱員、向僱主提供服務的外判商員工或自僱人士。

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布新措施，其中包括由今年九月十八日起就侍應生及初級廚師兩個申請職位實行更嚴格的二比一人手比例規定，由以每名申請僱主的所有職位為基礎計算，改為以申請職位計算。換言之，僱主申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師各一名，便須已聘用本地全職侍應生及初級廚師各兩名。新措施聚焦於輸入勞工較多的指定工種，針對該行業勞動力市場的變化，務求確保本地工人優先就業。

僱主提交優化計劃申請時，必須如實呈報全職本地僱員人數。如僱主於申請期間明知而作出或罔顧實情地作出虛假或有誤導性的陳述，即屬違法，可被檢控。勞工處嚴謹審批每宗申請，確保申請符合優化計劃的規定。審批過程中，勞工處會全面審視僱主遞交的文件及資料，並考慮其行業和業務性質、公司規模、申請職位詳情和過往申請紀錄等因素，如有需要，會要求僱主提交進一步資料或證明文件，或安排勞工督察巡查僱主的辦事處和擬輸入勞工的工作地點，核實其申請資料。

獲批准輸入勞工的僱主亦須持續符合人手比例要求的規定。勞工處今年六月進行特別巡查行動，到聘用輸入勞工的企業查核僱主有否持續符合人手比例的規定；並按違規風險，要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例。勞工處絕不姑息任何違規行為，如有足夠證據，會施加行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准，以及拒絕處理僱主隨後提交的其他申請，禁制期可達兩年。

今年八月底，經優化計劃在港工作的輸入勞工約35 000人，佔香港的勞動人口約1%。政府沒有本地勞工在個別工種所佔比例的統計資料。

政府會繼續密切監察本地勞工市場及各行業人力情況的變化，如有需要，會靈活及精準地調整優化計劃的實施安排。

（三）及（四）政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地工人的就業機會。從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，非法勞工、僱主，以及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。

在加強情報收集和嚴格執法方面，各執法部門一直主動搜集情報，對懷疑有非法工作的場所進行聯合行動。根據入境事務處（入境處）的記錄，二○二五年一月至八月期間打擊非法勞工的執法行動（包括與警務處等部門進行聯合行動）次數，較二○二四年月均數字上升5.1%，有關數字表列如下：

註：該年被檢控的人士並不一定於同年被拘捕。

​針對不法之徒利用網上平台招攬和安排非法勞工來港，入境處的網絡罪案及法證調查小組持續進行網上巡邏。如發現有人利用社交平台或即時通訊軟件組織、安排、慫恿市民干犯聘用非法勞工等嚴重罪行，會以「放蛇」等方式展開執法行動。如當中涉及內地網上平台，入境處會與內地當局交換情報，並促請內地當局與相關平台作適當跟進，包括下架涉事的帖文。例如入境處於今年八月下旬至九月初，透過網上巡邏留意到有內地攝影師及化妝師利用社交平台宣傳，聲稱可以在香港提供服務。入境處經調查及採取「放蛇」行動後，合共拘捕10人，包括八名內地非法勞工。

此外，入境處於二○二五年《施政報告》公布同日（九月十七日）推出舉報非法勞工專線（3861 5000），鼓勵市民積極舉報非法勞工相關行為。舉報專線推出首兩星期，入境處已收到過百宗電話舉報。入境處會廣泛宣傳舉報專線，積極跟進每宗舉報，包括按情報分析採取執法行動。

為進一步加大力度打擊非法勞工，保安局於二○二五年九月成立跨部門反黑工專責組（專責組），成員包括勞工及福利局、教育局、運輸及物流局、入境處、警務處、勞工處和運輸署。專責組已於二○二五年十月二日召開首次會議，討論非法勞工的現況，並同意透過制定應對非法勞工的整體策略、強化情報搜集及與內地情報交換、嚴厲執法、善用科技，以及協調相關宣傳和教育等方面加強跨部門協調，多管齊下打擊非法勞工。專責組會繼續密切留意非法勞工的情況，並適時制定整體應對策略，以保障本地勞工就業。

（五）政府自二○二五年六月三十日起在一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃下增設技術專才類別，容許外來人士申請來港投身八項人力極短缺的技術工種，申請者須為符合技術專才清單」列明資格的非學位專才，年齡介乎18至40歲。按照一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃的現行規定，相關技術專才須在申請前先獲得本地企業聘任，其薪酬待遇亦須達同類工作的市場水平。新增渠道為期三年，設有共10 000個申請名額，當中每項技術工種的申請名額以3 000個為限，以避免個別行業規模較大的技術工種迅速佔用絕大部分配額。有關限額並非政府引入個別技術工種的人數目標。

入境處已陸續收到查詢，並正審批接獲的申請。新安排實施至今僅三個月，政府正密切留意推行情況，稍後會適時公布有關統計數字，並會在新安排推行一年後進行檢討。

（六）政府統計處在進行人口及勞動人口推算時，會綜合考慮當時各項人才計劃下獲批簽證的人士及其受養人的抵港數目及人口特徵，以推算人口及勞動人口的長遠發展趨勢。政府統計處進行的住戶統計調查（包括二○二六年人口普查）亦涵蓋在港居住的新來港人士的就業情況，當中包括獲批簽證的人才及其受養人。另外，勞工及福利局會持續關注受養人在港的就業情況，例如透過網上問卷調查等方式，收集高端人才通行證計劃受養人的教育背景、就業狀況及就業意向等，所得資料將納入人力推算中期更新的模型作參考。上述資料有助政府更全面了解受養人在本地勞動市場的情況。"
LCQ20: Safeguarding employment opportunities for local workers,2025-10-08 12:15,2025-10-08 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800278.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  The 2025 Policy Address has proposed measures to ensure employment priority of local workers. On the other hand, the Government has, since June 30 this year, introduced a new channel under the General Employment Policy and the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals, allowing individuals meeting the qualifications under the Technical Professional List to come to Hong Kong to engage in eight skilled trades facing manpower shortage. However, there are views pointing out that the relevant arrangements may create negative impacts on the employment opportunities for local workers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the 2025 Policy Address has proposed to tighten the manning ratio requirement for waiters/waitresses and junior cooks under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) (i.e. a manning ratio of 2:1 for full-time local employees to imported workers), and change the current calculation method based on all posts being applied for by employers to the one based on individual posts being applied for, whether the Government has compiled statistics on the proportion of local workers in individual trades under the existing manning ratio requirement of ESLS; whether it has identified employers hiring local workers in different trades or on a part-time basis to meet the manning ratio requirement of ESLS; if such cases have been identified, of the Government's existing monitoring mechanisms and improvement measures;

(2) whether it will consider extending the arrangement for tightening the manning ratio requirement mentioned in (1) to more post categories, and study prohibiting employers from hiring local workers on a part-time basis to meet the manning ratio requirement;

(3) given that the 2025 Policy Address has proposed to step up efforts to combat illegal workers, including establishing a dedicated reporting hotline and promoting more inter-departmental joint operations, of the Government's specific plans and expected effectiveness in respect of the aforesaid measures;

(4) as it is learnt that in recent years, some lawbreakers have arranged for illegal workers to come to Hong Kong to provide services after soliciting business through social media platforms (such as Xiaohongshu), and then arranged for such illegal workers to work in concealed locations, of the total number of surprise inspections conducted by the Government to combat illegal workers in the past year and the effectiveness of such enforcement actions, including the number of illegal workers and employers arrested in such actions, as well as the number of prosecutions instituted;

(5) regarding the eight newly added skilled trades on the aforesaid Technical Professional List, of the respective numbers of applicants and approved quotas for each trade to date; whether it has plans to dynamically adjust the quotas for each trade based on the progress of local training and manpower supply; if not, whether it will consider establishing a mechanism which allows both additions and deductions to avoid excessive quotas and safeguard employment for local skilled personnel; and

(6) whether the Government has grasped Hong Kong's employment situation in respect of dependants of individuals coming to Hong Kong under various talent admission schemes (including individuals coming to Hong Kong who meet the qualifications under the Technical Professional List), including information such as the trades in which they engaged, their income levels and educational backgrounds, and whether it has assessed the impacts of the employment situation of such dependants on the local labour market; whether the Government will compile statistics on the information of such dependants when conducting manpower projections or population censuses, so as to assess the relevant manpower supply and demand trends; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The primary objective of the Government's manpower policy is to nurture local talent, complemented by admission of outside talent. In the face of industrial transformation and a continuously ageing population, the Government has implemented a host of measures to proactively trawl for talent since end-2022 to expand the talent pool. On the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government also enhanced the mechanism for importation of labour in 2023 and launched sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, as well as the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) to suitably allow employers to apply for importation of workers when they are genuinely unable to recruit suitable local workers. According to the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115) (IO), the period of stay of these imported workers in Hong Kong is not regarded as ordinarily residing in Hong Kong and hence they would not obtain the Hong Kong permanent resident status by virtue of their stay as imported workers in Hong Kong. The Government has been closely monitoring the employment market, and making timely and targeted adjustments to the implementation arrangements for labour importation as well as combating illegal workers rigorously, so as to ensure employment priority for local workers and maintain labour supply to support Hong Kong's economic development.

  In 2025, the Government introduced a new channel under the General Employment Policy (GEP) and the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP) targeting specified skilled trades facing acute manpower shortage to allow young and experienced non-degree professionals to come to Hong Kong to replenish the local labour force. Vocational professionals admitted to Hong Kong through these two channels may accumulate years of residence in Hong Kong and apply to become Hong Kong permanent residents in future if meeting the specified eligibility criteria under the IO. They are therefore fundamentally different from imported workers and the two should not be conflated together.

  In consultation with the Security Bureau (SB) and the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) ESLS requires employers applying for importation of labour to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers (manning ratio requirement). In general, employers shall have employed two full-time local workers for bringing in one imported worker. Full time employees refer to local employees who are directly employed by an employer and work not less than 35 hours per week for operating the relevant business, excluding part time staff, staff of sub contractor(s) or self employed person(s) providing services to the employer.

  The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address new measures, including implementing from September 18 this year a more stringent manning ratio requirement of 2:1 when employers apply for the posts of waiter/waitress and junior cook by changing the calculation basis of applying the ratio from all posts of an applicant employer to each post under application. In other words, an employer applying to import a waiter/waitress and a junior cook must have already employed two local full-time waiters/waitresses and two local full-time junior cooks. The new measure focuses on job categories with more imported workers, responding to changes in the labour market of that industry in a targeted manner with a view to ensuring priority employment for local workers.

  Employers shall truthfully report the number of full-time local employees when submitting ESLS applications. An employer knowingly or recklessly makes a statement which is false or misleading during the application commits an offence and is liable to prosecution. The Labour Department (LD) rigorously processes each application to ensure compliance with ESLS requirements. During the vetting process, the LD thoroughly reviews the documents and information submitted by an employer, and takes into account factors such as the industry of the employer and business nature, company size, details of applied posts and past application records. If necessary, the LD will require an employer to provide additional information or supporting documents, or arrange Labour Inspectors to conduct inspection to an employer's office and workplace(s) of prospective imported worker(s) to verify the application information.

  Employers with approval to import workers shall meet the manning ratio requirement on a continuous basis. The LD launched a special inspection campaign in June this year to check whether establishments employing imported workers had continuously met the manning ratio requirement. The LD also requires employers to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratios based on a risk-based approach. The LD does not tolerate any acts of non-compliance and will impose administrative sanction if there is sufficient evidence, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of workers previously granted to the employer(s) and refusal to process other subsequent applications with a debarment period up to two years.

  As at end-August this year, there were around 35 000 imported workers working in Hong Kong under ESLS, accounting for around 1 per cent of Hong Kong's labour force. The Government does not have statistical information on the proportion of local workers in individual job categories.

  The Government will continue to closely monitor changes in the local labour market and the manpower situation of different industries, and adopt a flexible and targeted approach in making adjustments to the implementation arrangements of ESLS if necessary.

(3) and (4) The Government is committed to combating illegal employment so as to safeguard employment opportunities of local workers. It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Illegal workers, employers, as well as persons aiding and abetting illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the IO.

  On strengthening intelligence collection and strict law enforcement, various law enforcement agencies have been proactively collecting intelligence and conducting joint operations to raid premises suspected of having illegal employment activities. According to the records of the Immigration Department (ImmD), the monthly average number of law enforcement operations against illegal workers (including joint operations with other departments including the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF)) conducted in January to August 2025 was 5.1 per cent more than that in 2024. The relevant figures are tabulated below:

2024
17 906


2025 (up to August)
			[Compared with the monthly average of 2024]
12 543

  During the same period of 2025, the monthly average numbers of illegal workers and employers arrested and prosecuted both increased compared with that in 2024. The relevant figures are tabulated below:

Remark: Persons prosecuted may not be arrested in the same year.

  Targeting lawbreakers making use of online platforms to recruit and arrange illegal workers to come to Hong Kong, the Cybercrime and Forensics Investigation Group of the ImmD conducts constant cyber patrols. It will take enforcement actions by, among others, decoy operations against any person who is found using social media platforms or instant messaging software to organise, arrange or incite the public to commit serious crimes, such as illegal employment. If the Mainland online platforms are involved, the ImmD will exchange intelligence with the Mainland authorities and urge them to arrange with the relevant platforms for taking appropriate follow-up actions, such as taking down the posts involved. For example, in late August and early September this year, the ImmD noticed through cyber patrols that some Mainland photographers and make-up artists were promoting on social media platforms, claiming that they could provide services in Hong Kong. After investigation and conducting decoy operation, the ImmD arrested a total of 10 persons, including eight Mainland illegal workers.

  Besides, on the same day of the delivery of the 2025 Policy Address (September 17), the ImmD launched the Dedicated Hotline for Reporting Illegal Workers (3861 5000) in order to encourage the public to actively report illegal employment-related acts. In the first two weeks since the launch of the reporting hotline, the ImmD had already received over 100 telephone reports. The ImmD will widely promote the reporting hotline and actively follow up on each report, including taking enforcement actions based on intelligence analysis.

  To further step up efforts in combating illegal employment, the SB established in September 2025 an Inter-departmental Task Force against Illegal Employment (Task Force), including members from the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), the Education Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the ImmD, the HKPF, the LD and the Transport Department. The first meeting of the Task Force was convened on October 2, 2025, at which the Task Force discussed the current situation of illegal employment, and agreed to enhance inter-departmental coordination on various fronts, including formulating overall response strategies against illegal employment, enhancing intelligence collection and intelligence exchange with the Mainland, enforcing the laws rigorously, leveraging technology, and co-ordinating relevant publicity and education, so as to combat illegal employment under a multi-pronged approach. The Task Force will continue to closely monitor the situation of illegal employment and formulate overall response strategies in a timely manner to safeguard the employment of local workforce.

(5) The Government introduced the technical professionals stream under GEP and ASMTP from June 30, 2025 to allow outside individuals to apply for entry into Hong Kong to join eight skilled trades facing acute manpower shortage. Applicants are required to be non-degree professionals meeting the relevant qualifications as specified in the Technical Professional List and aged between 18 and 40. According to the prevailing requirements under GEP and ASMTP, relevant technical professionals are required to have secured an employment offer from a local enterprise before making applications, and the remuneration package should be commensurate with the market level for similar jobs. This new arrangement will be piloted for three years with an overall application quota of 10 000, and the application quota for each skilled trade is limited to 3 000 to prevent occupations with larger industry scales from quickly exhausting the quotas. The relevant quota does not represent the Government's target number for admitting technical professionals in individual skilled trades.

  The ImmD has been receiving enquiries and is processing the applications received. The new arrangement has only been in place for three months and the Government is closely monitoring its implementation. Relevant statistics will be released later at an opportune time, and a review will be conducted after the new arrangement has been implemented for a year.

(6) When conducting population and labour force projections, the C&SD takes into account the number and demographic characteristics of approved visa holders under various talent admission schemes and their dependents in assessing the long-term development trends of the population and labour force. The household surveys (including the 2026 Population Census) conducted by the C&SD also cover the employment situation of new arrivals living in Hong Kong, including approved visa holders and their dependents. Additionally, the LWB will continue to monitor the employment situation of dependents in Hong Kong. For example, we are collecting information through online surveys on the educational background, employment status and employment intentions, etc, of dependents admitted under the Top Talent Pass Scheme. The information obtained will be considered by the projection models of the mid-term update of the manpower projection. The above information helps the Government gain a more comprehensive understanding of the status of dependents in the local labour market."

（ii）社會福利署（社署）除了發放宣傳物品及播放短片外，該署轄下24間精神健康綜合社區中心（綜合社區中心）亦定期舉辦不同類型的互助小組、工作坊、流動展覽等公眾教育活動，積極傳遞正向信息，推廣精神健康知識，鼓勵大眾以正面態度求助、及早關注精神健康需要，以提升公眾的抗逆能力。針對成年人（包括中年人士）因工作壓力、經濟負擔及家庭責任而面臨的精神健康挑戰，綜合社區中心亦有特別舉辦中年男士互助小組和工作坊；

（iii）精神健康諮詢委員會於二○二○年七月起推出一個名為「陪我講Shall We Talk」的持續精神健康推廣和公眾教育計劃，致力宣傳精神健康的正面信息，以提升市民大眾對精神健康的認識及關注，並在有需要時尋求專業人士的協助。該計劃通過一站式網站（shallwetalk.hk）、社交媒體專頁、電視及電台節目、宣傳海報、線下活動（包括在大專院校、中小學舉行巡迴活動）等不同方式傳遞有關精神健康的訊息；並有配合世界防止自殺日而推出有關防止自殺的知識和技巧，以及相關求助的資訊；

（iv）教育局鼓勵學校採用全校參與模式，以「普及性」、「選擇性」、「針對性」三個層面，透過課程、資源、活動、培訓及專業支援等，促進學生的精神健康，以及加強支援有精神健康需要的學生。教育局於二○二四／二五學年推行《4Rs精神健康約章》，並於本學年以抗逆力作為核心主題，鼓勵學校訂立目標及採取具體行動，在校園推廣精神健康，強化所有學生的抗逆能力。

為進一步加強精神健康社區參與和公眾教育，政府將推行「精神健康推廣大使培訓先導計劃」，動員及培訓精神健康推廣大使推廣健康生活方式、培養抗逆力、構建關懷同行的支援網絡。

識別較高風險群組並及早介入

及早識別較高風險群組，提供針對性支援服務和早期干預，有助降低潛在自殺風險。就此，有關部門推行了以下措施：

（i）醫衞局於二○二四年在三個地區康健中心／康健站推出精神健康評估先導計劃，試行在社區層面為市民提供免費的精神健康初步評估，以達致發展基層醫療的「早發現、早治療」目標，加強為有需要人士提供適切支援。政府將會於二○二六年擴展先導計劃至九個中心，由具備心理學或輔導學等學歷背景及訓練的人員提供跟進服務。醫衞局亦為地區服務及關愛隊伍隊員提供精神健康急救培訓，提升其在社區中識別和協助高風險個案的能力；

（ii）社署已設立「網上青年支援隊」，透過社交媒體及其他網上平台接觸情緒不穩定或有自殺意念的青少年，為他們提供情緒支援、輔導及適切轉介服務。社署自今年六月起加強支援隊服務，通過青少年情緒健康網上支援平台「Open噏」，為有情緒困擾及即時危機的青少年提供24小時即時網上輔導服務，讓他們可以隨時隨地得到適切的支援，並將加強人工智能應用以更精準發掘風險高的支援對象。

高風險個案的危機干預

針對有自殺傾向或精神健康問題的高風險個案，各部門提供深入輔導和危機干預，詳情如下：

（i）現時有關部門及津助機構設有多條熱線，為有自殺傾向及受情緒困擾人士提供即時支援，並鼓勵及轉介他們到相關服務單位接受深入輔導，包括社署熱線（2343 2255）、東華三院芷若園危機介入及支援熱線（18281）、明愛向晴熱線（18288）、青年熱線服務（2777 8899）及照顧者支援專線（182183），以及「18111情緒通」24小時熱線，一站式為來自任何背景、任何年齡的市民提供情緒及精神健康支援和轉介；

（ii）社署轄下24間精神健康綜合社區中心為有精神健康需要或自殺傾向人士提供情緒支援、個案管理及輔導服務，並與醫院管理局及其他福利服務單位合作，為高風險個案提供即時支援及轉介；

（iii）由社署津助的香港撒瑪利亞防止自殺會營辦自殺危機處理中心，為自殺問題困擾的人士（包括因財務問題而有自殺傾向的男性）提供外展、危機介入及深入輔導服務。社署亦透過資助香港明愛及東華三院，提供專門服務，包括輔導及建議，以提升財困人士的抗逆力，並會按需要轉介他們接受相關的社會服務、協助獲取所需支援和其他專業服務，以支援因為財困而出現情緒／家庭問題的個人及家庭；

（iv）為及早識別和支援有高自殺風險學生並提供針對性支援，政府透過教育局、醫務衞生局和社會福利署跨部門協作，在二○二三年十二月開始在全港中學推行以學校為本的三層應急機制，結合校內跨專業團隊、校外支援網絡和醫療服務，並於二○二四年優化有關安排。政府已宣布於二○二五／二六學年恆常化在中學實施三層應急機制，並擴展至在小學四至六年級試行，加強支援有需要的學生。

（三）教育局及大學教育資助委員會（教資會）十分關注專上院校在提高學生防騙意識方面採取的措施，一直透過與各大學代表組成的溝通平台保持緊密聯繫，鼓勵各院校透過不同渠道向學生推廣防騙資訊。為提高非本地學生的防騙意識和警覺性，各院校積極與執法機構及本地銀行合作，透過舉辦家長講座、入學簡介會、設立資訊專頁和專責熱線等提供防騙及反詐騙的資料。

自二○二五年新學年開始，警方已走訪各大學進行反詐宣傳。警務處處長早前亦透過全港大專院校去信新來港學生及他們的家長，呼籲他們要特別留意幾類常見行騙手法，以及防範的方法，並鼓勵他們善用警方的「防騙易熱線」及「防騙視伏App」。警方亦已推出「網上學習套件」，本地、內地及海外學生須觀看圖文和影片教學，了解騙案手法和應對建議，回答多項選擇題，及格者可獲發電子證書。為應對二○二五年新學年前後學生騙案的高峰期，警方已推出新版網上學習問卷，備有繁體中文、簡體中文及英文版本，涵蓋電話騙案、投資騙案、求職騙案手法和警方反詐騙協調中心資訊。此外，警方於新學年前後舉辦超過30場防騙教育講座和活動，吸引超過4 000名本地、內地及海外學生參與，當中包括加強宣傳網上學習套件，並安排乖巧寶寶防騙主題車走訪專上院校，向學生及教職員傳遞防騙信息等。

教資會一直支持大學提倡精神健康和正向教育，並加強對學生的各類支援服務，包括心理輔導及精神健康支援。在二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五三年期，教資會增撥3,000萬元設立「全人發展基金」，支持各教資會資助大學舉辦豐富學生課外學習體驗的項目，從而推動年輕一代的全人發展，而推廣正向教育及心理健康屬四個主要範疇之一。大學除了運用撥款舉辦不同活動和朋輩支援計劃外，亦利用撥款加強心理輔導的人手，應付學生的服務需要。此外，大學亦正利用教資會提供的「內地與環球連繫及學習體驗資助計劃」的額外撥款，舉辦提倡多元校園文化的活動，推動不同背景及文化的學生增進交流，以締造多元共融的國際化學習環境。"
LCQ15: Assisting members of the public in relieving stress,2025-10-08 12:10,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800264.htm,"Following is a question by Professor the Hon Priscilla Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  A research institute has recently announced that, according to the statistics of the Coroner's Court, the suicide rate in Hong Kong was estimated at 14.1 per 100 000 people last year. This represents an increase of 0.6 from 13.5 in 2023, which exceeds international standards. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will, in light of the latest situation, strengthen mental health and emotional support services in the community, as well as step up publicity and education efforts on social media to help citizens from diverse backgrounds relieve stress, so that they will know where to seek help; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it has been reported that the suicide rate among males aged between 25 and 39 saw the most significant increase last year, with 28.6 per cent of male suicides attributed to financial problems such as debts, unemployment, gambling or business failures, whether the Government will consider collaborating with community organisations and professional bodies to provide targeted counselling services for male groups, assist them in channelling their emotions and formulate appropriate response plans; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as it has been reported that a Mainland university student studying in Hong Kong has recently fell to her death after allegedly falling victim to phone scams, whether the Government will consider further strengthening cooperation with tertiary institutions by not only enhancing students' awareness of fraud prevention, but also strengthening the emotional support services for Mainland and overseas students, with a view to enabling them to focus on their studies and enjoy a simple and positive campus life in Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Factors leading to suicide are multi-faceted, including emotional issues, personal health, interpersonal relationships and financial position. Each case varies and cannot be generalised. The Government attaches great importance to suicide prevention, and has been providing multi-tiered support through multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration among various policy bureaux and departments, public organisations, and other stakeholders within the community. These efforts aim to promote public education, identify high-risk groups, intervene early, and provide appropriate counselling and support services to individuals with suicidal tendencies and their families.

In consultation with the Health Bureau (HHB), the Education Bureau (EDB) and the Security Bureau, our reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2)

Public education and promotion

In order to enhance public awareness of mental health, foster a positive mental health culture, and strengthen resilience, various departments have been implementing various public education and promotion programmes, including:

(i) The Labour and Welfare Bureau organises an annual Mental Health Month to raise public awareness of mental health through lectures, exhibitions, community activities, and workshops, etc, and convey positive messages, encouraging individuals to care for their own emotional well-being as well as that of others;

(ii) Apart from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) distributing promotional materials and broadcasting short videos, the 24 Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness (ICCMWs) under the SWD regularly organise different types of mutual support groups, as well as public education activities such as workshops and mobile exhibitions, to actively deliver positive messages, promote mental health knowledge, encourage the public to adopt a positive attitude towards seeking help and pay early attention to their mental health needs, with a view to strengthening resilience of the public. Specifically in response to the mental health challenges arising from work pressure, financial burdens and family responsibilities, faced by adults, including the middle-aged population, ICCMWs also organise mutual support groups and workshops specially for middle-aged men;

(iii) The Advisory Committee on Mental Health has launched a mental health promotion and public education initiative named ""Shall We Talk"" since July 2020. The initiative commits to promoting positive messages of mental health with a view to stepping up public knowledge and awareness of mental well-being and of seeking assistance from professionals when needed. The initiative delivers messages on mental health through different channels, including a one-stop website (shallwetalk.hk), a social media page, television and radio programmes, promotion posters, offline events such as road shows in tertiary education institutions, primary and secondary schools. Separately, the initiative disseminates information or knowledge and skills in suicide prevention and relevant information on ways to seek help provided in support of the World Suicide Prevention Day;

(iv) The EDB encourages schools to adopt a whole-school approach to promote students' mental health and strengthen support for students with mental health needs at three levels, namely Universal, Selective and Indicated through curriculum, resources, activities, training, and professional support. The EDB has been implementing the 4Rs Mental Health Charter since the 2024/25 school year. With ""Resilience"" being the core theme of the current school year, schools are encouraged to set targets and take concrete actions to promote mental wellness in campus and strengthen resilience of students.

In order to further strengthen community engagement and public education of mental health, the Government will implement the Pilot Programme on Training for Mental Health Promotion Ambassadors to mobilise and train mental health promotion ambassadors to promote healthy lifestyles, foster resilience and establish care support networks.

Identifying high-risk groups and early intervention

Identifying high-risk groups and providing targeted support services and early intervention helps reduce potential suicide risks. To that end, relevant departments implemented the following measures:

(i) HHB launched the Healthy Mind Pilot Project in 2024 at three District Health Centre (DHC)/District Health Centre Expresses to provide free preliminary mental health assessments at the community level. The pilot project aims to achieve the primary healthcare goal of ""early detection and early treatment"" and strengthen support for individuals in need. The Government will extend the pilot project in 2026 to cover nine DHCs, with follow-up services to be provided by practitioners with an academic background and training in fields such as psychology or counselling. The HHB also provided mental health first aid training to members of District Services and Community Care Teams to enhance their ability to identify and assist high-risk cases within the community;

(ii) The SWD has set up Cyber Youth Support Teams (CYSTs) to reach out to emotionally unstable youth or those with suicidal thoughts via social media and other online platforms, and provide emotional support, counselling and appropriate referral services. The SWD has enhanced the services of CYSTs in June 2025. Through the online youth emotional support platform ""Open Up"", CYSTs provide 24-hour real-time online counselling service for young people experiencing emotional distress and immediate crises, allowing them to receive support anytime, anywhere. The application of artificial intelligence will be strengthened for more precise identification of high-risk targets in need of support.

Crisis intervention for high-risk cases

Departments provide in-depth counselling and crisis intervention for high-risk cases with suicidal tendencies or mental health issues. Details are as follows:

(i) Currently, relevant departments and subvented organisations operate multiple hotlines to provide immediate support to individuals with suicidal tendencies or emotional distress, and encourage and refer them to relevant service units for in-depth counselling. These include the SWD Hotline (2343 2255), the crisis intervention and support hotline of the CEASE Crisis Centre under the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals (18281), the Caritas Crisis Line (18288), the Hotline Service for Youth at Risk (2777 8899), and the Designated Hotline for Carer Support (182183), as well as the ""18111 – Mental Health Support Hotline"" which provides one-stop, round-the-clock emotional and mental health support and referral for individuals regardless of background and age;

(ii) The 24 ICCMWs under the SWD provide emotional support, case management, and counselling services to individuals with mental health needs or suicidal tendencies. They work with the Hospital Authority and other welfare service units to provide immediate support and referrals for high-risk cases;

(iii) The Samaritan befrienders Hong Kong subvented by the SWD operates the Suicide Crisis Intervention Centre which offers outreaching, crisis intervention, and in-depth counselling services for individuals troubled by suicide-related issues (including male with financial stress and suicidal tendency). Also, the SWD subsidises Caritas Hong Kong and Tung Wah Group of Hospitals to provide specialised services, including counselling and advice, to enhance the resilience of persons with financial distress, as well as to refer them to receive relevant social services according to their needs, assist them in obtaining other necessary support and professional services, in order to support individuals and families suffering from emotional distress or family problems as a result of financial distress.

(iv) In order to identify students with high suicidal risk early and provide them with targeted support, the Government has implemented the Three-tier School-based Emergency Mechanism across all secondary schools in the territory through interdepartmental collaboration of the EDB, the HHB and the SWD starting from December 2023. This mechanism integrates in-school multidisciplinary teams, the off-campus support network, and medical services and has been enhanced in 2024. The Government announced regularising the three-tier emergency mechanism in secondary schools in the 2025/26 school year and extending it on a trial basis to Primary Four to Six students to strengthen support for those in need.

(3) The EDB and the University Grants Committee (UGC) pay close attention to the measures taken by post-secondary institutions in raising anti-scam awareness among students, and have maintained close liaison with them through the communication platform formed by university representatives. The institutions are encouraged to promote anti-scam messages to students through various channels. To raise non-local students' anti-scam awareness and vigilance, the institutions work closely with law enforcement agencies and local banks to disseminate information on anti-scam and fraud prevention through organising seminars for parents and admission talks, and setting up dedicated information webpages and hotlines, etc.

Since the new academic year of 2025, the Police have visited various universities to carry out anti-scam publicity campaigns. Earlier on, the Commissioner of Police has also sent a letter to the newly arrived students and their parents through all tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, urging them to pay particular attention to several common fraud tactics and advising them of ways to guard against such fraud. They are also encouraged to make good use of the Police's Anti-Scam Helpline and Scameter+. The Police have also launched an Online Learning Package. Local, Mainland and overseas students will have to learn about scam tactics and be given advice on counter measures through the tutorials in the forms of texts, images and videos. They will then have to complete the multiple choice questions provided. Those who have passed the test will receive an e-certificate. To cope with the peak of scams involving students around the new academic year of 2025, the Police have launched an updated version of the online learning questionnaire in traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese and English, covering scam tactics such as telephone deception, investment fraud and employment fraud, as well as information provided by the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre of the Police. Furthermore, the Police have organised over 30 scam prevention educational talks and seminars, and activities around the start of the new academic year, which have attracted the participation of more than 4 000 local, Mainland and overseas students. The activities included stepping up promotion of the online learning package and arranging visits to tertiary institutions by the Quby themed anti scam promotional truck to disseminate anti scam messages to students and staff.

UGC has been supporting the universities to promote mental health and positive education and strengthen various student support services, including counselling and mental health support. For the 2022/23 to 2024/25 triennium, UGC additionally allocated $30 million to establish the Whole-person Development Fund to support each UGC-funded university to organise projects that enrich students' learning experience outside the classroom, thereby promoting whole-person development among the younger generation. The promotion of positive education and psychological well-being was one of the four key areas. Apart from deploying funds to conduct different activities and peer support programmes, the universities also made use of the funds to strengthen the manpower for counselling to meet the service demands from students. In addition, the universities are utilising the additional allocation provided by UGC under the Funding Scheme for Mainland and Global Engagement and Student Learning Experience to organise activities for a multi-cultural campus, so as to promote exchanges between students from different backgrounds and cultures to create a diversified and inclusive international learning environment."

LCQ6: Installation of traffic signal systems at roundabouts,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800271.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Michael Tienand a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

It is learnt that since the installation of a traffic signal system at Pok Oi Roundabout in Yuen Long on February 9 this year, members of the public and motorists generally consider that the system has effectively eased traffic flow and significantly improved traffic conditions at the roundabout. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the comparisons of the following traffic data at Pok Oi Roundabout before and after the installation of the traffic signal system:
(i) the average traffic queue length (in metres) at each of the southbound and northbound entrances during peak hours (7am to 10am and 5pm to 8pm);
(ii) the time period during which the longest traffic queue occurred and its duration;
(iii) the average time taken for vehicles to pass through the roundabout; and
(iv) changes in the number of traffic incidents (set out by nature of the incidents); and

(2) whether it has plans to, after obtaining data confirming that traffic signal systems can effectively improve traffic flow and safety at roundabouts, conduct a comprehensive study on installing a real-time adaptive traffic signal system at every roundabout in Hong Kong, with a view to using artificial intelligence and big data to monitor traffic flow and adjust signals in real time; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Pok Oi Roundabout is a major hub in Yuen Long and a key route for vehicles travelling to and from Yuen Long Town in the Northwest New Territories. Heavy traffic flows are observed at Pok Oi Roundabout during morning and evening peak hours, resulting in increased travelling time. The Government has been monitoring the traffic situation there and has implemented several road improvement works in phases. After consulting the Transport Department (TD), my response to the question raised by the Hon Michael Tien is as follows:

(1) Traffic improvement measures at Pok Oi Roundabout in Yuen Long, which include the installation of traffic signal controls and the widening of the exit to Au Tau, were implemented on February 9, 2025. The traffic signal controls effectively balanced the flow of vehicles at various entrances of the roundabout, allowing vehicles to enter in an orderly manner. The widening of the exit to Au Tau provided additional road space, streamlining the traffic flow there. As the daily traffic pattern and variations at the Pok Oi Roundabout are relatively stable, the current traffic signal time plan set for different time periods has effectively streamlined the traffic flow, thereby significantly shortening the traffic queues and queuing time to enter the roundabout, and enhancing its operational efficiency. The traffic data before and after the implementation of the aforementioned traffic improvement measures is provided at Annex.

(2) Roundabout is a common design of road intersection in Hong Kong. In general, roundabouts can self-regulate the vehicular flow, enabling smooth passage of vehicles from various directions under varying traffic volumes. The TD continuously monitors the traffic conditions and implements feasible improvement measures as needed, such as adjusting traffic lane designs, optimising road markings and signage, to maintain smooth operation of roundabouts and ensure road safety.

Under certain traffic conditions—particularly when exceptionally heavy volumes enter the roundabout from one or more directions—the roundabout's self-regulating capacity may become overwhelmed. In these instances, installation of traffic signals at appropriate locations of roundabout can control the approaching traffic, allow vehicles from different directions to enter the roundabout in an orderly manner and enhance its operational efficiency (such as Pok Oi Roundabout in Yuen Long).

In addition to the traffic flow characteristics in roundabouts aforementioned, the TD takes into account a range of factors when considering the installation of traffic signals at a roundabout. These include the necessity for traffic signals, the size of roundabout, road layout, geographical constraints, and driver behavior.

Regarding the enquiry about installing a Real-time Adaptive Traffic Signal System (RTATSS) at roundabouts, RTATSS uses sensors placed at junctions and employs AI to analyse traffic patterns in real time—across various directions and time periods. It calculates and optimises the allocation of green time to improve flow for both vehicles and pedestrians, effectively balancing the needs of all road users. RTATSS implemented under pilot project undertaken by the TD are currently operating smoothly, with data showing an approximate 5 per cent to 10 per cent reduction in average delay for vehicles passing through the junctions, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency of junctions. The TD is planning to implement the RTATSS at approximately 50 suitable isolated signalised junctions across the territory with the first batch scheduled for commissioning in 2026. The TD is also arranging pilot installations at other linked signalised junctions with relatively heavy traffic flow to test relevant technologies from other places (including the Mainland). This will contribute to the formulation of plans for the wider adoption of RTATSS at other suitable junctions.

Regarding the installation of RTATSS at signalised roundabouts, the technical complexity is greater compared to conventional signalised junctions because the system has to simultaneously detect and process traffic circulating within the roundabout as well as traffic waiting to enter the roundabout from each approach lane. The TD will review the feasibility of extending RTATSS to signalised roundabouts after accumulating more experience from its application at conventional signalised junctions."
LCQ21: e-CNY wallets,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800250.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Holden Chow and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

  Hong Kong has become the first pilot area outside the Mainland where e-CNY wallets have been made fully available for setting up and use by residents since May last year. According to a press release issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in May last year, Hong Kong users could top up their e-CNY wallets via the Faster Payment System (FPS) through 17 local retail banks, with support for cross-border payments in 26 Mainland pilot areas (including Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area). It is learnt that while e-CNY wallets have been in operation for a year or so, public concerns have persisted over e-CNY wallets' usage restrictions, application scenario coverage and cross-border efficiency. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the total number of e-CNY personal wallets set up by Hong Kong residents and their utilisation rate (i.e. at least one transaction per month) as at May this year; if it has not compiled such statistics, whether the HKMA will collect such data in the future; whether the progress of setting up e-CNY wallets in Hong Kong meets the authorities' expectations as compared with other Mainland pilot cities (e.g. Shenzhen or Shanghai);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the current coverage rate of Hong Kong retail merchants accepting e-CNY payments, and the respective distribution of such merchants across the three regions, namely Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories; if it has not compiled such statistics, whether the HKMA will collect such data in the future; whether the HKMA has assessed the effectiveness of its specific measures to promote the acceptance of e-CNY wallets by local merchants for payment;

(3) as there are views that while the add value service via FPS offers convenience, the current limit per transaction and annual cumulative payment limit for e-CNY wallets are RMB 2,000 and RMB 50,000 respectively, whether the authorities have assessed if such arrangements are sufficient to meet Hong Kong people's cross-border consumption demand; whether the relevant limits will be relaxed specifically for business travellers or frequent users of e-CNY wallets;

(4) in the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge project jointly conducted by the HKMA with other central banks, of the cumulative amount of cross-border trade settlement completed by Hong Kong enterprises using e-CNY and the reduction in handling fees; whether it knows the measures put in place by the HKMA to enhance enterprises' participation in the project; and

(5) whether it knows the HKMA's specific timetable for rolling out functional upgrade (e.g. introducing real-name authentication and increasing personal transfer limits) to e-CNY wallets and expanding the application scenarios (e.g. supply chain finance and cross-border payment of wages) for enterprises?

Reply:

President,

  The Government attaches great importance to promoting fintech development, and has been working closely with financial regulators as well as industry players to adopt multi-pronged measures for driving fintech forward.

  In May 2024, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) expanded the scope of e-CNY pilot in Hong Kong to facilitate the set-up and the use of e-CNY wallets by Hong Kong residents, as well as the top-up of e-CNY wallets via the Faster Payment System. The e-CNY provides an additional option of safe, convenient and innovative payment to residents of the two places, thereby enhancing efficiency and user experience of cross-boundary payment services, as well as promoting interconnectivity of the two places.

  In consultation with the HKMA, our reply to the five parts of the question is as follows.

(1) and (2) The HKMA maintains close liaison with the Digital Currency Institute of the PBoC, as well as the subsidiary banks of the Mainland operating institutions in Hong Kong, to understand the usage of e-CNY wallets and gauge user feedback. The HKMA also encourages banks to promote more local retail merchants to accept e-CNY. It is understood that the number of local retail merchants accepting e-CNY is gradually increasing.

  As the Mainland operating institutions are responsible for operating the e-CNY wallets and providing relevant services, the HKMA does not maintain statistics on the number of e-CNY wallets set up by Hong Kong residents and their utilisation rate, as well as the coverage rate of Hong Kong retail merchants accepting e-CNY payment.

(3) and (5) The HKMA will continue to work closely with the PBoC to facilitate the progress of e-CNY cross-boundary pilot in Hong Kong, including promoting more local retail merchants to accept e-CNY, and exploring more application scenarios, with a view to expanding the scope of e-CNY pilot.

  The PBoC and the HKMA are exploring the arrangements and feasibility of upgrading e-CNY wallets, with a view to increasing the usage limit of e-CNY wallets and supporting more application scenarios. As the discussion is still ongoing, the specific proposals and timetable are not finalised yet.

(4) In June 2024, the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge (mBridge) project reached the ""Minimum Viable Product"" (MVP) stage. The mBridge platform adopts permissioned distributed ledger technology developed specifically for the project, which enables local banks of both payers and recipients to conduct direct transaction settlement, thereby significantly reducing the cost of cross-boundary payment. Participating commercial banks in Hong Kong determine the service fees for cross-boundary payment via the mBridge platform having regard to their operating costs and commercial considerations.

  Project mBridge has become a part of Hong Kong's financial market infrastructure.

LCQ3: Repair works for potholes on roads ,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800294.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Edmund Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

Hong Kong has experienced consecutive rainstorms during the summer holidays this year, and the Hong Kong Observatory had even issued Black Rainstorm Signal on a record-breaking five occasions within less than three weeks. It is learnt that after the rainstorms, some road users have complained about the numerous potholes of different sizes on road surfaces, which seriously affected road safety. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) regarding the Black Rainstorm Signal issued on five occasions during the summer holidays this year, of the number of reports or complaints received by the Highways Department (HyD) concerning the occurrence of potholes on road surfaces after the rainstorms, with a breakdown by the 18 districts across the territory;

(2) upon receipt of the reports or complaints mentioned in (1) by the authorities, of the minimum, maximum and average number of days required by the contractors responsible for road maintenance to complete the repair works; and

(3) as some members of the public have pointed out that roads with repaired potholes were easily damaged again by rainwater, and the repaired sections are repeatedly sustaining damage, whether the HyD has kept records of the roads concerned; whether the HyD has imposed penalties on the contractors responsible for road maintenance due to quality problems of the aforesaid repair works for potholes over the past three years, or instructed the contractors concerned to comprehensively enhance the quality of repair and maintenance works of road surfaces; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Highways Department (HyD), my reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Edmund Wong is as follows:

(1) The Hong Kong Observatory issued a total of five Black Rainstorm Warning Signals between July 29 and August 14 this year. The number of reports or complaints regarding potholes received by the HyD between July 29 and August 15 is at Annex.

(2) Upon receiving complaints or reports from the public regarding damage or defects on public roads, the HyD will inspect the site as soon as possible and arrange appropriate repairs in a timely manner with regard to the actual situation. In general, the HyD will immediately arrange contractors to carry out repair works as quickly as possible for cases involving potholes. Upon receiving the reports or complaints as mentioned in part (1), the HyD has completed the relevant repair works for potholes within 48 hours in accordance with the department's performance pledge, while approximately 90 per cent of them were completed within a few hours to 24 hours.

(3) The HyD and its contractors generally record basic information on repairs of potholes, including the concerned road section, pothole size and completion time. However, the HyD does not specifically track whether the potholes are caused by deterioration of original paving material or detachment of temporary repair materials. Furthermore, road surfaces experience wear and tear from daily use and potholes may also emerge due to other unforeseen circumstances, including traffic accidents and inclement weather. Therefore, factors contributing to repeated damage of road surface cannot be generalised. The HyD does not maintain records on the frequency of repeated damage to potholes after repairs.

The HyD attaches great importance to the quality of road surfacing works and has a strict monitoring mechanism to ensure the quality and durability of road maintenance works. If the HyD identifies deficiencies in a contractor's work which fails to meet the contractual standards, it will follow up in accordance with the contractual provisions and established mechanism. This includes issuing corresponding Default Notices to the contractor for the defects if the contractor fails to complete road maintenance works and submit the relevant reports in time and properly, recording the deficiencies identified during audit inspections in audit inspection reports to assess the contractor's performance level, deducting contract payments based on the issuance of Default Notices and the contractor's performance level, as well as issuing warning letters to contractor due to overall poor performance or individual serious incidents resulting from inadequate performance. Contractors are also required to follow up and make improvements during monthly progress meetings. The HyD will also reflect contractor's inadequate performance in their performance evaluation reports. The ratings in these reports will directly affect contractor's future chances of winning new public works contracts. If the reports are consistently rated as unsatisfactory, the contractor may even be suspended from bidding. The HyD will continue to strictly monitor the contractors' performance to ensure that all damage is properly documented in accordance with relevant regulations during routine and detailed inspections, and relevant repair works are completed in a timely manner to ensure road safety.

Over the past three years, the HyD has taken appropriate follow-up actions in accordance with relevant contract terms whenever deficiencies in road maintenance works were identified (e.g. issuing Default Notices to contractors with unsatisfactory performance). However, as these follow-up works involve various types of maintenance deficiencies, the HyD does not maintain separate statistics specifically for the follow-up actions related to the quality of pothole repairs.

Apart from repairing road surfaces upon identifying potholes and strictly supervising the quality of contractors' work, the HyD has been closely monitoring road surfaces which are prone to damage. Taking into account various factors, the HyD will formulate appropriate maintenance plans and schedules for theses sections and other damaged road surfaces which do not pose an immediate threat to road safety. For example, more comprehensive and durable resurfacing works may be carried out when appropriate to prevent accelerated deterioration due to various conditions (including intensive rainfall). In March this year, the HyD established the Strategic Road Maintenance Committee led by the Deputy Director of Highways. Representatives from relevant departments were invited to join the Committee to advise and assist in the maintenance of public roads. The Committee will jointly compile a list of roads that require large-scale maintenance, and prioritise maintenance works based on various factors such as the extent of damage to each section of the road and the resources required for the repair works. This allows the Committee to arrange appropriate maintenance works for the roads in Hong Kong in a more strategic and organised manner.

At the same time, the HyD is also committed to adopting innovative technologies to enhance the efficiency of road repair and maintenance services. By utilising artificial intelligence in the Road Defect Detection System (Note 1) and laser scanning for three-dimensional imaging in Road Condition Assessment System (Note 2) to assist in the detection and integration of the road defects information, the accuracy of road inspections and efficiency of repair works can be improved while facilitating long-term planning of maintenance works.

In addition, the HyD is actively researching more durable paving materials to slow down the rate of road deterioration and reduce the frequency of maintenance work to minimise inconvenience to the public. Since April 1 this year, the HyD has fully adopted highly modified bituminous paving materials for paving at suitable locations to further improve the overall quality of road pavements in Hong Kong. This material has better anti-deformation, anti-aging and anti-fatigue performance than conventional bitumen, and can effectively enhance the durability of roads and reduce the maintenance frequency. Among them, the ""Highly Modified Friction Course"" is more durable than conventional materials while still retaining its ability to rapidly discharge rainwater from the road surface, thereby minimising the occurrence of potholes on road surface due to water accumulation.

The HyD will continue to actively implement the abovementioned initiatives. In addition to strictly supervising contractors in carrying out road repair work, it will proactively implement preventive maintenance for Hong Kong's road surfaces by adopting innovative technologies and continuously monitoring and exploring the introduction of suitable new road pavement materials, so as to minimise inconveniences to the public caused by road surface damage in the future.

Note 1: This system has been incorporated into the standard operating procedures for road inspections for regular use.

Note 2: The relevant road inspection vehicles are currently conducting inspections on public roads throughout Hong Kong. The HyD will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the system and consider implementing it in future maintenance contracts."
立法會三題：修葺道路坑洞的工作,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800270.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上黃俊碩議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

本港於今年暑假期間發生連場暴雨，香港天文台更加破紀錄在不足三周時間內發出五次黑色暴雨警告信號。據悉在暴雨過後，有道路使用者投訴路面出現很多大小不一的坑洞，嚴重影響行車安全。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）就今年暑假期間所發出的五次黑色暴雨信號，路政署接獲多少宗有關大雨過後路面出現坑洞的報告或投訴，並按全港18區列出分項數字；

（二）當局收到第（一）項所述的報告或投訴後，負責道路維修的承建商完成修葺工作的最短、最長及平均天數為何；及

（三）鑑於有市民指出，一些已完成坑洞修葺工作的的道路很容易再被雨水沖毀，經修葺的部分經常再出現損毀，路政署有否備存相關道路的紀錄；過去三年，路政署有否就上述修葺坑洞工作的質量問題而向負責道路維修的承建商作出懲處，或責成有關承建商全面提升路面修葺和保養工作的質量；如有，詳請為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就黃議員提問的各部分，經諮詢路政署後，現回覆如下：

（一）香港天文台於今年七月二十九日至八月十四日期間共發出五次黑色暴雨警告信號。在七月二十九日至八月十五日期間，路政署接獲各區路面出現坑洞的報告或投訴個案數字見附件。

（二）路政署接獲有關公共道路損毀或欠妥的投訴或公眾報告後，會盡快派員到場視察，並根據實際情況適時安排合適的維修。一般而言，涉及路面坑洞的個案，路政署會立即安排承建商盡快維修。路政署在收到第（一）部分所述的報告或投訴後，有關修葺路面坑洞的工作均按部門服務承諾在48小時內完成，其中約九成個案更於數小時至24小時內完成。

（三）路政署及其承建商一般會記錄有關修葺路面坑洞的基本資料，包括所在的路段、坑洞的大小及完成修葺的時間等，惟並無特別就坑洞是否因原有鋪路物料出現破損或臨時修補物料脫落所致作統計。另外，由於道路設施的路面會因日常使用出現損耗，亦會因其他不能預見的情況，包括交通意外及惡劣天氣等而引致出現坑洞，因此導致路面重複出現損毀的因素不能一概而論，路政署並無備存坑洞經修葺後重複出現損毀的次數之相關資料。

路政署十分重視路面工程的質素，並設有嚴格的監管機制以確保道路維修工程的質素及耐用程度。如路政署發現承建商的工作欠妥，未能達到合約指定水平，會根據合約規定及既定機制作跟進，包括因應承建商未有準時及妥善完成道路維修保養工作並提交相關報告，向其發出關於欠妥事項的相應違約通知書、將審核巡查期間發現的不足之處記錄在審核巡查報告內，用以評估承建商的服務水平、根據發出違約通知書的情況及承建商的服務水平扣減合約款項，以及因應承建商整體表現欠佳，或其表現欠妥導致發生個別嚴重事故發出警告信等，並會在每月進度會議上責成承建商跟進及改善。路政署亦會將承建商的欠妥表現反映在其表現評核報告中，報告的評分會直接影響承建商日後投得新工務工程合約的機會，而報告若持續被評為不合格，承建商更有機會被暫停投標資格。路政署會繼續嚴格監察承建商的工作表現，確保承建商在進行例行檢查及詳細檢查時，按相關規定記錄所有損毀情況，並適時完成有關的維修工作，以確保道路的安全。

路政署曾於過去三年在發現道路維修工作欠妥時，根據相關合約條款作出適當的跟進（例如向表現不理想的承建商發出違約通知書）。然而，由於相關跟進工作涉及各種維修工作欠妥的情況，路政署並無特別就路面坑洞維修的質量問題的跟進工作分拆備存有關統計數據。

除在發現坑洞後為路面進行修復工作，並嚴格監督承建商的工程質素外，路政署一直密切監察較多出現損毀的路面，並會適時為這些路面及其他不會對道路安全構成即時危險的破損路面，在考慮不同因素後，制定合適的維修計劃和時間表，例如適時為其進行較全面及持久的重鋪工程，以防有關路段因各種不同情況（包括密集降雨等）而較易再次出現耗損。今年三月，路政署更成立由副署長領導的道路維修策略委員會，邀請相關部門的代表加入委員會就公共道路維修提供意見及協助，共同制定需進行大規模道路維修工程項目的清單、按每段路面的損毀程度和所需資源等因素排列工程項目的優先次序等，更有策略及有規劃地為本港道路安排適切的維修保養工作。

與此同時，路政署亦致力採用創新科技，以提升道路維修和保養工程服務的效率。透過採用人工智能偵測道路欠妥系統（註一）及激光掃描路面三維影像的路面狀況評估系統（註二）等協助偵測並整合道路的欠妥情況，以提升道路巡查的準確度及維修工作的效率，並幫助長遠維修保養工作的規劃。

此外，路政署積極研究更耐用的鋪路物料，以減慢道路損毀的速度乃至減低維修工作的頻率，同時減少對市民造成的不便。自今年四月一日起，路政署已全面採用高改性瀝青物料於合適位置作鋪路之用，以進一步提升本港整體路面質素。該物料在抗變形、抗老化及抗疲勞方面的表現均優於傳統瀝青，能有效提升道路的耐用性並減少維修次數。其中，「高改性瀝青多孔摩擦層」比傳統物料耐用之餘，同時仍能保留迅速排走路面雨水的功能，能減少路面因積水而導致出現坑洞的情況。

路政署會繼續積極推展上述工作，在嚴格監督承建商進行路面修復工作以外，主動透過採用創新科技及持續留意並探討引入合適的新路面物料等為本港路面進行預防性保養工作，減低日後可能因路面受損而對市民造成不便的機會。

註一：此系統已被納入為道路巡查的標準作業程序作恆常使用。

註二：有關的巡路檢測車正為全港的公共道路進行檢測。路政署將評估該系統的成本效益，並考慮在未來的維修合約中推行。"
Labour Department suspends recognition of safety training courses operated by two training course providers,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800258.htm,"The Labour Department (LD) today (October 8) suspended the recognition of the Mandatory Basic Safety Training Course (Construction Work) (commonly known as the Green Card Course) organised by the Neighbourhood & Worker's Service Centre (NWSC) and the Hong Kong Federation of Women's Centres Limited (HKFOWCL) for a period of six months, until April 7, 2026.
â
The LD found that the NWSC had violated the approval conditions for operating the course, including disclosing all examination questions and relevant answer choices to trainees before the examination by a trainer, and allowing a trainee who did not fulfil the required attendance to attend the examination. After conducting thorough investigations and gathering evidence, and taking into account the explanations and representations provided by the NWSC and the trainer involved, the LD decided to suspend its recognition for six months in view of the serious nature of the violation. The trainer involved was also removed from delivering the respective course at the NWSC. All trainees involved will not be issued green cards.

The LD also found that the HKFOWCL had violated the approval conditions for operating the course, including failing to ensure that invigilators were present in examination rooms during the course examinations. Furthermore, the trainer involved did not invigilate the examination in a proper manner, resulting in the failure to detect trainees discussing answers with each other during the examination. After conducting thorough investigations and gathering evidence, and taking into account the explanations and representations provided by the HKFOWCL and the trainer involved, the LD decided to suspend its recognition for six months in view of the serious nature of the violation. The trainer involved will also be suspended from delivering the respective course for a period of six months at the HKFOWCL. The green cards of all trainees involved in cheating were recalled and cancelled.

A spokesman for the LD said, ""The LD is highly concerned about the quality of mandatory safety training courses. In response to the recommendations in the report released by the Office of The Ombudsman on its direct investigation into the 'Government's Regulation of Occupational Safety and Health in the Construction Industry', the LD has increased manpower since April this year to monitor compliance with approval conditions by recognised training course providers to maintain the standard of the training courses and ensure that workers receive appropriate occupational safety and health (OSH) training. If a training course provider does not comply with the approval conditions set by the LD, its recognition to operate the relevant courses will be withdrawn or suspended. The LD will continue to closely monitor the quality of all training course providers and their trainers and strive to enhance the standard of OSH in Hong Kong.""

After imposing the above sanctions, there are 132 training course providers offering the recognised Green Card Course. Relevant course information has been uploaded to the LD's website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/osh/content5.htm) for public reference. Individuals interested in enrolling in the relevant course may contact these training course providers.

立法會六題：在迴旋處加裝交通燈號系統,2025-10-08 12:00,2025-10-08 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800265.htm,"以下是今日（十月八日）在立法會會議上田北辰議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉元朗博愛迴旋處自本年二月九日加裝交通燈號系統後，市民及駕駛人士普遍認為該系統有效疏導車流，顯著改善該迴旋處的交通情況。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）博愛迴旋處於加裝交通燈號系統前後的以下交通數據的比較為何：
（i）繁忙時間（上午七時至十時及下午五時至八時）南行入口及北行入口之平均車龍長度（以米計）；
（ii）最長車龍出現的時段及持續時間；
（iii）車輛平均通過迴旋處所需時間；及
（iv）交通事故宗數的變化（按事故性質列出）；及

（二）有否計劃在獲得數據確定交通燈號系統有效改善迴旋處的交通流量及安全性後，全面研究在全港迴旋處加裝實時交通燈號調節系統，以人工智能及大數據實時監測車流調整燈號；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

元朗博愛迴旋處是新界西北車輛進出元朗市的要道，也是元朗區內的樞紐，於早上和傍晚上下班的時間較為繁忙，令行車時間增加。政府一直關注該地點的交通情況，並已逐步落實多項道路改善工程。就田北辰議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）在元朗博愛迴旋處加設交通燈及擴闊凹頭方向出口的改善措施已於二○二五年二月九日啓用。設置交通燈有效平衡迴旋處各入口的車流，令車輛有序地進入，而擴闊後的凹頭出口可提供額外路面空間，讓該位置的車流更加暢順。博愛迴旋處每天的車流特性及變化相對穩定，現時在不同時段設定的交通燈號時間已有效疏導車流，大幅縮短等候進入迴旋處的車龍和所需時間，提升迴旋處的運作效率。上述交通改善措施實施前後的交通數據載於附件。

（二）迴旋處是香港常見的路口設計。一般而言，迴旋處具備自我調節車輛通過的能力，能在不同的車流量下有效地讓來往各個方向的車輛順利通過路口。運輸署持續留意迴旋處的交通情況，並根據實際需要適時採取可行的交通改善措施，包括調整行車線設計、優化道路標記及道路標誌等，以維持迴旋處的運作暢順和確保行車安全。

在特定的交通情況下，例如當迴旋處一個或多個方向進入的車流量特別大，影響迴旋處自我調節車輛通過的功能時，在迴旋處合適位置裝設交通燈可調控相關方向進入迴旋處的車流，從而讓各個方向的車輛有序地進入迴旋處，提升迴旋處的運作效率（例如元朗博愛迴旋處）。

運輸署在迴旋處加設交通燈時除考慮上述的迴旋處車流特性外，也會一併考慮一籃子因素，包括加設交通燈的需要、迴旋處大小、道路設置、地理限制及駕駛者習慣等。

至於有關研究在迴旋處加設實時交通燈號調節系統的提問，實時交通燈號調節系統透過在路口加設感應器，以人工智能實時分析不同時段及方向的人流和車流，並進行運算，從而更有效地分配車輛及行人的綠燈時間，平衡不同道路使用者的需要。現時，運輸署的有關先導計劃運作暢順，數據顯示車輛通過路口的平均時間減少約5%至10%，路口的運作效率得以提高。運輸署正逐步把實時交通燈號調節系統推展至全港約50個合適的獨立燈控路口，首批會於二○二六年啓用，並正安排在其他交通流量較高的聯動式路口試點安裝，藉此引入和測試其他地區（包括內地）的相關技術，以協助制定把系統推展至其他合適路口的計劃。

至於在交通燈控制的迴旋處加設實時交通燈號調節系統，由於系統需要同時偵測及處理正在迴旋處內行駛，以及在迴旋處外準備駛入各行車道的車流狀況，技術上較一般交通燈控路口更為複雜，運輸署正累積更多於一般路口應用實時交通燈號調節系統的經驗，以期檢視將系統推展到燈控迴旋處的可行性。"

問題：

香港自去年五月成為內地以外首個全面開放居民開立和使用數字人民幣錢包（數幣錢包）的試點地區。而根據香港金融管理局（金管局）在去年五月發出的新聞稿，香港用戶可透過17間本地零售銀行經「轉數快」為數幣錢包增值，並支援在內地26個試點地區（包括粵港澳大灣區內地城市）進行跨境支付。據悉數幣錢包雖已推行一年多，但公眾對數幣錢包的使用限制、應用場景覆蓋及跨境效率仍存有疑慮。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，截至本年五月，香港居民已開立的個人數幣錢包總數及使用率（即每月有進行至少一次的交易）分別為何；如沒有統計，金管局未來會否收集有關數據；與內地其他試點城市（例如深圳或上海）相比，本港數幣錢包的開立進度是否符合當局預期；

（二）有否統計，現時香港零售商戶接受數字人民幣支付的覆蓋率，以及相關商戶在香港島、九龍及新界三個區域的分布分別為何；如沒有統計，金管局未來會否收集有關數據；金管局有否評估其推動本地商戶接受數幣錢包進行支付的具體措施的成效為何；

（三）鑑於有意見認為，轉數快的增值服務雖然便利，但現行數幣錢包的單筆支付金額限額及年累計支付金額限額分別為2,000元和5萬元人民幣，當局有否評估相關安排是否足以滿足香港市民的跨境消費需求；會否針對商務旅客或數幣錢包的高頻使用者放寬相關限額；

（四）在金管局與其他中央銀行共同開發的「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」項目中，香港企業透過數字人民幣完成跨境貿易結算的累計金額及手續費降幅分別為何；是否知悉，金管局有何措施提升企業在該項目的參與度；及

（五）是否知悉，金管局就數幣錢包的功能升級（例如推出實名認證和提高個人轉帳金額）及拓展企業應用場景（例如供應鏈金融和跨境薪資發放）的具體時間表為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府十分重視金融科技發展，一直與金融監管機構及行業持份者緊密合作，採取多管齊下措施推動金融科技向前邁進。

二○二四年五月，中國人民銀行（人民銀行）與香港金融管理局（金管局）擴大數字人民幣在香港的跨境試點，便利香港居民開立和使用數字人民幣錢包（數幣錢包），並透過「轉數快」為數幣錢包增值。數字人民幣為兩地居民提供多一個安全、便捷及嶄新的支付選擇，提升跨境支付服務效率和用戶體驗，促進兩地互聯互通。

就問題的五個部分，經諮詢金管局後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）金管局一直與人民銀行數字貨幣研究所，以及內地運營機構於香港的子銀行保持緊密溝通，了解數幣錢包的使用情況及用戶反饋，並鼓勵銀行推動更多本地零售商戶接受數字人民幣。據了解，接受數字人民幣的本地零售點正逐步增加。

由於內地運營機構負責營運數幣錢包及提供有關服務，金管局沒有香港居民已開立的數幣錢包總數及使用率，以及香港零售商戶接受數字人民幣支付覆蓋率的統計數字。

（三）及（五）金管局會繼續配合人民銀行推動數字人民幣在香港的跨境試點進程，包括促進更多本地零售商戶接受數字人民幣，以及探索更多應用場景，以擴大數字人民幣的試點覆蓋範圍。

人民銀行及金管局正探討數幣錢包升級的安排及可行性，以提高數幣錢包的使用額度，以及支援更多應用場景。由於相關討論仍在進行中，具體方案及時間表有待落實。

（四）二○二四年六月，「多種央行數碼貨幣跨境網絡」（mBridge）項目進入「最簡可行產品」階段。mBridge平台採用專門為該項目開發的許可制分布式分類帳技術，使付款人和收款人的本地銀行可以直接進行交易結算，從而大大降低跨境支付成本。香港參與的商業銀行會根據其營運成本及商業考量，釐定透過mBridge平台提供的跨境支付服務手續費。

mBridge項目已成為香港金融市場基建的一部分。隨着項目進入「最簡可行產品」階段，mBridge項目團隊將持續優化和增強平台功能，包括支援參與商業銀行與mBridge的應用程式介面系統對接，以提升交易效率，以及改善企業客戶的體驗。此外，mBridge項目將逐步擴大公營和私營機構的參與，為跨境支付提供更高效及更便捷的服務選項。"

答覆：

主席：

就問題的各部分，經諮詢財政司司長辦公室，現回覆如下。

（一）根據《財政司司長法團條例》（第1015章），財政司司長法團（法團）是由當時執行財政司司長職務的人成立的單一法團。法團可代表政府持有和管理政府資產，政府會按需要透過該法團直接或間接持有負責特定項目的公司，以提供公共服務或實踐重要的政策目標，例如香港數碼港管理有限公司、香港鐵路有限公司、香港科技園公司、機場管理局、香港投資管理有限公司、香港國際主題樂園有限公司等。

（二）這些企業可以按市場原則運作，透過引入商業模式的管理架構和專才，以靈活和市場化的營運和財務安排運作。除協助政府達致政策目標，亦可鼓勵創新和提高生產力，以提升服務質素和效率；亦可推動相關業界的發展，優化本港的產業結構。

這些企業在日常運作方面有相當大的自主權，但負責相關政策的政策局或部門會透過不同方式監督它們的發展方向和運作，以保障公眾利益以及政府作為股東的權益，主要措施包括：

（i）委派相關政策局和／或部門的人員擔任企業的董事會成員監察企業表現、參與重大決策的討論，並就營運方針、企業計劃和財務預測等提供意見，確保企業的運作符合相關政策目標和妥善運用資金，以保障政府的股東權益和公帑的運用。政府代表亦會在董事會就與公眾相關的議題提供意見，確保企業的運作能顧及公眾利益；

（ii）設立監察機制，包括由政府司局長檢視及批核企業的年度計劃和財務預算、制定主要績效指標、規定這些企業定期向政府提交報告等。個別企業亦受專屬法例規管（如機場管理局和香港科技園公司等），當中清楚訂明有關監察制度；以及

（iii）這些企業須定期向立法會匯報其財政狀況、工作進度等。

（三）二○二五年《施政報告》宣布成立由行政長官擔任主席的「北部都會區發展委員會」，下設三個工作組。其中，由財政司司長任組長的「發展及營運模式設計組」（設計組）會按北部都會區（北都）各指定發展區的性質和規模，設計發展及營運模式，包括為不同產業園區度身成立園區公司、法定或非法定專門機構，制定公私營合作模式、為區內產業用地和主要發展項目制定合適的批撥土地方案，以及相應的融資安排。設計組於二○二五年九月二十九日已召開首次會議。

設計組會參考以往參與重要發展項目所採用的模式，秉持開放、靈活及創新的思維，研究最切合北都各個發展區和園區的發展方案，在制度上拆牆鬆綁，並善用市場力量，以多元化方式，加快北都發展和產業進駐。"
LCQ22: Management of Government property,2025-10-08 11:45,2025-10-08 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100800214.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Andrew Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (October 8):

Question:

 The Financial Secretary Incorporated (FSI) may hold and manage Government property, and for certain large development projects involving the Government such as the Cyberport, the Government will also set up companies owned by FSI to deal with the projects. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the projects FSI is currently engaged in or managing, directly and indirectly, and the companies or bodies owned by FSI (set out in a table);

(2) for the projects in which FSI is directly or indirectly engaged as mentioned in (1), of the government departments responsible for the actual monitoring of such projects, and the management frameworks or mechanisms respectively; and

(3) given that the 2025 Policy Address proposes to set up a Working Group on Devising Development and Operation Models, to be led by the Financial Secretary, under the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis to formulate development and operation models for industry parks in the Northern Metropolis, taking into account their nature and scale, whether the Government will draw on the models and mechanisms previously employed in projects in which FSI was directly or indirectly engaged, or introduce other new models in taking forward and running the projects of various industry parks; if so, of the details?

Reply:

President,

 In consultation with the Financial Secretary's Office, my reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Under the Financial Secretary Incorporation Ordinance (Cap. 1015), Financial Secretary Incorporated (FSI) is a corporation sole constituted by the person who for the time being is performing the duties of the office of Financial Secretary. The FSI may hold and manage government assets on behalf of the Government, and the Government would, as required, through the FSI, directly or indirectly hold companies specifically established for individual projects, with a view to providing public services or achieving important policy objectives. Examples include Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, MTR Corporation Limited, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, Airport Authority, Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, Hongkong International Theme Parks Limited, etc.

(2) These enterprises can operate in accordance with market principles, which allows them to bring in the management and expertise from the commercial sector and adopt more flexible and market-oriented financial and operational arrangements. Apart from helping the Government to achieve policy objectives, this arrangement can also encourage innovation and enhance productivity, improve service quality and efficiency, and promote the development of relevant industries, thereby facilitating structural upgrades of Hong Kong's industries.

 These enterprises have considerable autonomy in their day-to-day operations. Nevertheless, government bureaux or departments in charge of relevant policies oversee their development direction and operations through various means to safeguard public interests and the Government's interests as a shareholder. These measures mainly include:

(i) appointing officers from relevant bureaux and/or departments to serve as board members of these enterprises to monitor their performance, participate in discussions on major decisions, and provide advice on their operational strategies, corporate plans and financial projections, with a view to ensuring that the enterprises' operations align with relevant policy objectives and that resources are properly utilised, thereby safeguarding the Government's interest as a shareholder and the use of public money. Government representatives also provide input at board meetings on issues relevant to the public to ensure that enterprises would give due regard to public interest in their operations;

(ii) establishing monitoring mechanisms, including having Secretaries of Departments and Directors of Bureaux review and approve enterprises' annual plans and financial budgets, setting key performance indicators, and requiring these enterprises to submit regular reports to the Government. Individual enterprises are also regulated by specific legislation (such as the Airport Authority and Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, etc.) which clearly stipulates the relevant monitoring mechanisms; and

(iii) requesting these enterprises to regularly report to the Legislative Council on their financial position, work progress, etc.

(3) The 2025 Policy Address announced the establishment of the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis chaired by the Chief Executive, under which three working groups have been set up. Among them, the Working Group on Devising Development and Operation Models (the Working Group) led by the Financial Secretary will formulate development and operation models for designated development areas in the Northern Metropolis (NM), taking into account their nature and scale. This will include setting up dedicated companies, or statutory or non-statutory bodies, for various industrial parks, devising public-private partnership approaches, considering appropriate land disposal approaches for industry land and major development projects in the NM, as well as the suitable financing arrangements. The Working Group held its first meeting on September 29, 2025.

 The Working Group will make reference to the models previously adopted in participating in major development projects, and adopt an open-minded, flexible and innovative approach in considering the development strategies that best suit the characteristics of various development areas and industry parks of the NM. It will endeavour to remove unnecessary barriers and ease restrictions and leverage market capital with a view to accelerating the development of NM and anchoring of industries through a diversified approach."

"LCSD's ""Cheers!"" Series to present family entertainment programmes from November to February next year (with photos)",2025-10-08 11:30,2025-10-08 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/08/P2025100200663.htm,"  The annual ""Cheers!"" Series, presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, will be held from November to February next year. Offering a variety of family entertainment programmes ranging from puppetry, acrobatics, circus, dance, music and theatre to multimedia shows and musicals, the series will showcase fabulous performances by nine visiting and local performing groups that will delight audiences during the festive season.

  This edition of the series will feature five international award-winning productions and four local programmes. Starting the series in mid-November is the puppetry musical ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" (dubbed in Cantonese) by the Theater Company Hikosen from Japan. With delicate masks, beautiful costumes and ingenious stage props, the troupe will bring this beloved fairy tale to life, allowing children to join Jack on a fantastical adventure in climbing the beanstalk grown from magical beans and venturing into the giant's lair to rescue Princess Mary. This programme is also part of the third Asia+ Festival.

  Circus and acrobatic performances have always been popular among young audiences and their families. Two performers from the Australian ARC Circus Dance Theatre will present the Asian premiere of the physical theatre production ""A Bee Story"" in early December. This comedic show blends elements of circus, acrobatics, music and dance to tell the story of Queen Bee and Worker Bee, who work together to rebuild their hive after it is destroyed by a bushfire, conveying a message on environmental conservation. The Japanese contemporary circus company, Cirquework, will perform ""YOAH"" in late January next year. The story follows a girl who overcomes the magic of evil wizards and finds her way home with the moon's guidance. A team of young acrobatic artists will skilfully integrate music, stage lighting and visual effects to redefine the concept of a circus, enabling audiences to enjoy a unique and captivating journey.

  Many family-friendly puppet theatre works have incorporated multimedia elements to unleash imaginations and creativity in recent years. Xirriquiteula Teatre from Spain will present ""Laika"" in mid-January next year, employing shadow play, puppets, physical theatre, installations and film montage to tell the story of how Laika the stray puppy becomes the first space explorer to take on a thrilling adventure into the universe. The narrative encourages audiences to reflect on the human drive towards progress and the true meaning of life. A multimedia theatre show, ""The Storyville Mosquito"", will be staged in the opening season of the East Kowloon Cultural Centre in February next year. Canada's Kid Koala will film a real-time movie about a jazz-loving mosquito's musical adventure in the city in one take by using exquisite miniature puppets, sets and props alongside a live original music score, offering audiences a multifaceted experience combining cinema, theatre and a concert setting.

  The above programmes will be accompanied by various extension activities such as meet-the-artist sessions, backstage tours or workshops. For details, please visit www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/en/f_entertainment/groups_1883.html.

  Local art groups will also present a rich line-up of performances, including the Hong Kong Oratorio Society's concert ""The Messiah"" to commemorate the 340th anniversary of Handel, the Master of Oratorios; the multimedia children's puppet theatre ""One Lap - 16000km: The Little Penguin's Way Home"" by puppet theatre troupe Make Friends With Puppet; the non-verbal full mask theatre ""Plastic Island"" by Free-To-Play; and the tap theatre ""The Making of the Perfect Mulan"" by the professional tap dance company R&T (Rhythm & Tempo) with child performers. Details of these programmes will be announced on the above-mentioned website in due course.
