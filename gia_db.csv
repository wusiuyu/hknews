財經事務及庫務局局長談倫敦金屬交易所香港交割倉及採購政府樽裝飲用水（只有中文）,2025-08-19 13:44,2025-08-19 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/19/P2025081900466.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（八月十九日）出席華潤物流x GKE倫敦金屬交易所香港交割倉揭牌儀式後會見傳媒的談話內容：

財經事務及庫務局局長：很開心在這裏見到大家。今日我們來的目的是見證華潤（華潤物流x GKE）的LME（倫敦金屬交易所）倉儲的開幕。大家可以看到其實這是體現了「香港速度」，今年年初LME認證了香港作為遞交港後，在短短半年已經有八個倉儲落地，在上月亦已開始營運。今日有這麼好的揭牌儀式，讓我也見證了香港在商品交易和倉儲生態圈的建立，日後更加重要的是商品經濟怎樣能夠與金融方面，尤其是包括保險、融資等方面的對接，這是一個很自然的生態圈的建立，去豐富我們整個大宗商品交易生態圈，這是第一方面。

第二方面我想說的，可能是大家比較關心的，就是最近關於政府採購樽裝飲用水的事件。我們一直以來都很認真、很仔細地看待這件事，所以早前我們提出了三大方向，包括第一，在這件事的層面，由審計署以一個獨立的角色，去檢視這件事本身有甚麼問題。第二就是從制度出發，我會主持一個跨政策局的專責小組，在這個星期內開會，去看看從制度方面，我們可如何完善招標和採購，包括合約管理等一系列的制度性問題。第三是比較現時的，就是我們要由物流署（政府物流服務署）去作相關的善後工作。具體你看到，例如在昨日，我們已經宣布終止與相關供應商的合約，我們也會繼續緊密配合執法部門的相關調查工作。或者我談到這裏，歡迎大家提問。

記者：局長你好。想問今次招標是否一個公開招標？是否有一些門檻，或者是否有邀請一些供水商投標？審批的時候，條款與上一份標書有甚麼不同，最後相關合約的總金額是多少？政府可否確認有否付任何款項？今次除了鑫鼎鑫外，另外新界的供水商也是新的，想了解政府會否一併看看新界的供水商在同一個情況下會否就質量方面或有其他安全的問題？

財經事務及庫務局局長：大家見到最近這麼多的報道的同時，其實我們自己本身都發現到問題的，這正是為何我們即時主動地作出有關三重行動的宣布。那就是在署方的層面，在我們就此事的檢視層面，由審計署去做獨立調查和獨立的審視。同時也由局方去做整體的制度檢視，所以你見到我們是主動出擊和處理這件事的，這是第一方面。而第二方面在招標過程，正如你所說，牽涉的不單是買那一刻，也包括採購後的合約管理，包括日後面對相類似的商品或者服務採購時，我們怎樣能夠在制度方面有進一步的優化和提升，這些都是在我主持的專責小組中，會跨政策局地處理的。新界區方面，在我們的公告中也提及，我們進行今次的水質獨立檢查時，也包括新界方面的水源。與此同時，我們也直接聯絡了今次新界合約的供應商，以及聯絡到其背後的樽裝飲用水製造商，已確認到他們之間的關係。我們同時也做了相關的獨立檢測，知道他們的水本身的質素是符合我們的飲用水標準的。

記者：政府有否付過任何款項？可否確認一下？

財經事務及庫務局局長：我們昨日已經終止了相關供應商的合約。現在具體的善後工作正由物流署跟進。

記者：今次是否有官員需要問責？物流署是要負上主體責任，是否有人需要為今次事件辭職？你剛才提及的專責小組最快三個月有初步建議，為何要三個月那麼長時間？將來的採購過程是否可以有改善？另外想了解往後的採購審批程序會如何進行？為何今次會批了給一間新的公司？是否因為價錢問題？ 是否因為沒有看（公司）背景而只看價錢，所以批了給他們？

財經事務及庫務局局長：首先我要在此澄清，價錢絕對不是唯一，也不是第一標準來的。在我們考慮標書時，一定是綜合考慮的，包括一些技術上的、與價格無關的具體要求。價格是我們其中一個考慮，但絕非第一，亦絕非唯一的標準，這是第一方面。

第二方面，正如你所說，我們今次看到在整件事上是有問題的，有不足的。所以我們必須從制度上着手，希望通過一個全面的、認真的檢視，去看看我們在制度方面可以如何改善。我們的目標是希望做到表裏兼顧，標本兼治，能夠在制度方面找出當中的疏漏，積極應對。

第三方面，正如我剛才所說，我們的行動是非常主動和迅速的，例如專責小組很快便會在這個星期內開會，屆時我們會將相關信息與大家分享。

記者：政府有否付過任何款項？看到責成的主體是物流署，想問問審批是物流署還是財庫局做？為何負責的主體是物流署？

財經事務及庫務局局長：一直以來，我們採購的過程都是有一個既定的程序和既定的方針去做。當然因為看到出了這個問題，所以為何我們要從制度方面看看這件事。但是具體你剛才所講的款項，或其他方面的善後工作，物流署是在跟進的。"

尊敬的尹宗華副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、韓躍偉副總經理（華潤集團副總經理）、李晶首席執行官（GKE首席執行官）、唐家成主席（香港交易及結算所有限公司主席）、Bonnie（香港交易及結算所有限公司集團行政總裁陳翊庭）、Matthew（倫敦金屬交易所行政總裁Matthew Chamberlain）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

早上好！很高興出席今天的儀式，與各位一同見證華潤物流和GKE合作營運的LME（倫敦金屬交易所）交割倉正式揭牌。首先，容許我對兩個集團表示最熱烈的祝賀！

去年行政長官《施政報告》提出建設「大宗商品交易生態圈」，這是具重要戰略意義的佈局。大宗商品，特別是有色金屬，對全球各國的工業和產業發展非常關鍵，也支撐着全球一半的航運貨量。儘管美國挑起的關稅戰或許在短期內壓抑有色金屬的價格，但長遠來説，隨着新能源及高新科技產業的蓬勃發展，全球對相關金屬的需求會持續上升，市場機遇相當巨大。

我國是製造業規模世界第一、工業門類最齊全的工業大國，對有色金屬的需求量龐大，同時也擁有豐富金屬資源和領先的精煉技術，多種金屬的產量位居世界前列。在當前地緣政治深度重塑全球貿易格局之際，加入LME的交割網絡，是香港構建大宗商品交易生態的重要一步，對服務國家發展戰略和進一步鞏固提升香港國際金融與航運中心地位也具重要意義。就此，我想簡單分享三點。

第一是此舉會引領金屬交易市場的量變和質變。香港是國家的南大門，擁有世界一流、便捷通達和高效的物流體系，在這裏設立交割點，毗鄰全球其中一個最大的金屬消費和出口市場，相比依賴海外的倉庫，必定能大幅降低物流的時間和成本、提升配置效率。

近年來，更多的中國金屬品牌在LME註册交割，香港倉庫的設立將讓內地市場和LME交易體系更緊密連接，為內地相關企業提供更便捷的窗口去參與國際金屬交易，並提升它們的能見度。另一方面，香港是國際金融中心和離岸人民幣業務樞紐，在這裏建立LME倉庫，將讓我們更有條件推動大宗商品以人民幣計價和結算，引領市場變革，並提升人民幣在國際金屬交易中的使用和話語權。

第二是增強區域有色金屬供應的韌性。內地企業依賴海外倉庫進行交割，將面臨不少地緣政治風險和貿易壁壘的挑戰。香港在「一國兩制」下是自由港，貨物和資金自由進出、實行零關稅政策、清關高效順暢、物流網絡通達全球，在港的LME倉庫可成為「儲備點」與「穩定器」，發揮調節作用，助力關鍵金屬資源在區內的穩定供應。

第三是加強香港金融與物流服務的聯動發展和融合創新，並吸引各方利用香港多元化和高質量的第三方服務，如海運保險和仲裁服務等。而金屬期貨、對沖和衍生工具，以至跨境結算服務、價格指數等發展，亦會為香港國際金融中心注入新的動能。

華潤集團在香港紮根多年，在倉儲和物流的領域也投資多年、經驗豐富。我很高興看到華潤物流積極佈局參與香港大宗商品生態的建設，你們在長沙灣營運的兩個倉庫，更是香港目前唯一同時具備海陸聯運能力的交割地點，以優質高效的服務，支持香港國際金屬交易發展。

此外，特區政府亦已成立專責小組，檢視與黃金交易相關的各個範疇，在年內可以公布有關方案，推動香港發展成為國際黃金交易中心，包括實體的黃金交割。

最後，我再次祝賀華潤物流和GKE的倉庫揭牌，祝鴻圖大展、貨如輪轉，也祝在座各位事業宏達、身體健康！謝謝大家！"

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-08-19 09:43,2025-08-19 10:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/19/P2025081900263.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 19) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

HKSAR Government strongly opposes granting of asylum to two HK fugitives by Australia and UK respectively,2025-08-19 00:58,2025-08-19 01:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/19/P2025081900028.htm,"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government yesterday (August 18) expressed strong opposition to the granting of asylum to two Hong Kong fugitives endangering national security who have absconded overseas by Australia and the United Kingdom (UK) respectively.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said that the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, summoned the Consul-General of Australia in Hong Kong, Mr Gareth Williams, and the British Consul General in Hong Kong, Mr Brian Davidson, respectively yesterday afternoon. At the meeting, Mr Chan solemnly pointed out that the HKSAR Government opposes any country harbouring offenders in any form and is strongly dissatisfied with any conduct that harbours criminals under any pretext. He reiterated that such harbouring effectively allows certain individuals or organisations to be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts, which is no different from granting a special privilege to break the law. What Australia and the UK have done in harbouring these offenders totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law and is absolutely not conducive to the relationship between the HKSAR and the two governments.

Mr Chan stressed to the two countries' Consuls-General in Hong Kong that Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers must be held accountable. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Hong Kong Police are duty-bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security overseas. Those absconders are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security. It is necessary for the Police to take all lawful measures, including applying to the court for arrest warrants, to strongly combat the acts of abscondment, and such actions are fully justified, necessary and legitimate.

At the same time, any arrest and prosecution are based on facts and evidence, and is directed against the criminal act and has nothing to do with the political stance, background, thought or speech of the person(s) concerned. Anyone accused of breaching the law will face an open and fair trial. The Hong Kong courts will, as always, with sound rule of law and human rights protection, handle all cases in an independent, fair and just manner. There is no question of political persecution in Hong Kong.

At the meeting, Mr Chan reiterated that human rights in Hong Kong have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy shall be protected in accordance with the law. Regarding organisations and individuals endangering national security, the HKSAR Government will not condone their criminal acts, and will not give up pursuing them, including adopting all practical measures to bring those fugitives endangering national security who have absconded from Hong Kong to justice.

Mr Chan reiterated that the HKSAR Government will, as always, resolutely, fully and faithfully prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security, whilst upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people in accordance with the law. The HKSAR Government strongly demands that foreign governments immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, which are purely China's internal affairs.

The Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, also attended the aforesaid meeting."
特區政府強烈反對澳洲和英國分別對兩名香港通緝犯提供庇護,2025-08-18 23:23,2025-08-19 00:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081801095.htm,"就兩名涉及危害國家安全罪行而竄逃海外的香港通緝犯分別獲澳洲和英國提供庇護，香港特別行政區（特區）政府發言人今日（八月十八日）表示強烈反對。

發言人表示，政務司司長陳國基今日下午分別召見澳洲駐港總領事韋嘉鋒及英國駐港總領事戴偉紳。會上，陳國基嚴正指出，特區政府反對任何國家以任何形式包庇罪犯，亦對以任何藉口包庇罪犯的行徑表示強烈不滿。他重申，包庇行為等同是讓某些人或組織不需為其違法行為承擔法律後果，等同給予其犯法的特權。澳洲和英國在包庇有關罪犯方面的所作所為，是徹徹底底地踐踏法治原則和違反法治精神，絕不利於香港特區和兩地政府的關係。

陳國基向兩國駐港總領事強調，香港是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。香港警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛逃海外的罪犯被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當。香港警方採取一切合法措施，打擊有關潛逃行為，包括向法院申請拘捕令，通緝有關人士，做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。

同時，任何拘捕和檢控均基於事實和證據，都是針對犯罪行為，與其政治立場、背景、思想或言論無關。而任何被控觸犯法例的人均會獲公開及公平的審訊。香港法院會一如既往，以其良好的法治精神及人權保障，獨立地、公平公正地處理所有案件。香港並不存在政治迫害。

陳國基在會上重申，人權在香港一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》亦清楚訂明香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港居民享有的言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威等權利和自由，但是對危害國家安全的組織和個人，特區政府對其犯罪行為絕不姑息，一定追究到底，並採取一切可行方法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全的人士。

陳國基重申，特區政府會一如既往，堅定不移、依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動、依法保障香港市民的權利和自由，特區政府強烈要求外國政府立即停止干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。

保安局局長鄧炳強亦有出席上述會面。"
Termination of contract for bottled drinking water for government offices,2025-08-18 21:53,2025-08-18 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081801004.htm,"  The Government Logistics Department (GLD) stated today (August 18) that as it was not satisfied that the supplier for bottled drinking water for government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands would be capable of performing the contract, the GLD had terminated the contract immediately in accordance with contract terms today.

  The supplier, Xin Din Xin Trade Co., Limited (XDX), was awarded a contract by the GLD in June this year to supply bottled drinking water to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands starting from late June this year. Based on the information it received on the supplier's business operation earlier, as well as the Police's enforcement actions yesterday (August 17), the GLD reasonably believed that XDX would not be capable of performing the contract. Therefore, in accordance with contract terms, the GLD decided today to immediately terminate the relevant contract as well as three other contracts for supply of chemicals which were affiliated with XDX's owners. Moreover, the GLD will continue to be in full co-operation with the Police's investigation.

  The GLD will enhance the tender requirements for the supply of bottled drinking water to government offices, and conduct an open tender to select a suitable supplier of bottled drinking water for government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands. Before the new contract takes effect, the GLD has arranged for AS Watson Group (HK) Limited to supply bottled drinking water temporarily to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands starting from this week."
選管會向選舉委員會界別分組補選候選人簡介選舉法例及指引（附圖）,2025-08-18 21:35,2025-08-18 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800404.htm,"下稿代選舉管理委員會發出：

選舉管理委員會主席陸啟康法官今晚（八月十八日）在二○二五年選舉委員會（選委會）界別分組補選候選人簡介會，向候選人講解選舉安排、選舉活動指引內容及進行競選活動時應注意的重要事項，以確保補選在公開、誠實及公平的情況下進行。

陸啟康法官在簡介會說：「選委會界別分組補選的候選人提名期已於八月四日結束。候選人資格審查委員會較早前已經在憲報公布獲有效提名的100名候選人的姓名，以及10名獲有效提名為選舉委員會委員的獲提名人的姓名。」

陸啟康法官表示，這次補選需要競逐的界別分組共有六個，當中的候選人共有28名，將於九月七日舉行的選舉委員會界別分組補選競逐21個席位。選舉主任已於八月十二日以抽籤方式決定有關界別分組候選人姓名在選票上的排列次序，有關候選人印在選票上的候選人編號可於八月十二日刊登的憲報查閱。

陸啟康法官於簡介會上重點講解是次補選與候選人相關的安排及須注意事項。

禁止拉票區和禁止逗留區

在投票日，每個投票站外的若干範圍會被劃定為禁止拉票區，確保投票人在不受干擾的情況下進入投票站。而投票站入口和出口處的範圍會被劃定為禁止逗留區，任何人均不可在禁止逗留區逗留，亦不可在禁止拉票區內進行拉票或打手勢、示好等變相拉票行為。

投票站主任會要求在這些區域作出違規行為的人士離開，假如有關人士不遵守指示，執法人員或獲授權人員可將其逐離。

中央點票安排

是次補選將採用中央點票模式。投票結束後，所有投票箱會運送到設於香港會議展覽中心的中央點票站。選舉主任會在助理選舉主任和點票工作人員的協助下監督點票。如有問題選票，選舉主任會即場進行裁決，而其裁決將是最終決定。如對選舉主任的裁決有異議，選舉主任會作出紀錄，而候選人可按法律程序提出上訴。

中央點票站內將裝設攝錄設施。候選人、選舉代理人及監察點票代理人可以進入中央點票站，在點票區的指定範圍觀察點票過程。而公眾人士和傳媒亦可進入中央點票站觀察點票程序，但不可以進入點票區。中央點票站外會張貼通告，顯示在點票站公眾範圍內可容納入場人數的上限。

宣布選舉結果

所有選票點算完成並經數據資訊中心核實後，選舉主任會在中央點票站的問題選票裁決枱向在場的候選人及代理人公布點票結果。如果在場的候選人或選舉代理人沒有要求重新點算選票，選舉主任會隨即公布選舉結果。如果點算結果顯示仍然有空缺席位需要填補，而餘下得票最多的候選人出現相同票數，選舉主任會按法例，使用抽籤方式決定當選人。所有當選人會獲安排在當晚稍後時間在新聞中心的禮台上接受祝賀。

選舉結果會張貼在中央點票站外，及透過新聞稿和選舉網站（www.elections.gov.hk）發放。

選舉表格電子化

是次補選大部分選舉表格新增電子版本，候選人可透過「選舉事務處電子表格上載平台」和「選舉廣告中央平台」提交有關選舉表格。不過，一些表格如選舉開支及接受選舉捐贈之申報書及聲明書（選舉申報書）、載有法定聲明的表格等，根據現行法例或其他原因仍然須用紙本方式提交。

陸啟康法官提醒候選人，成功提交電子表格後，有關平台將以電郵或手機短訊發出確認通知，收到確認通知後無須再透過其他方式重複提交表格。

選舉開支及捐贈

根據法例，選舉開支是指為促使或阻礙某候選人當選所招致的開支。只有候選人本人及其選舉開支代理人才可以招致選舉開支，否則屬非法行為。

為確保各候選人在公平條件下參選，各界別分組均設有選舉開支上限：投票人數目不超過500人的界別分組，每位候選人的選舉開支上限為十萬元；投票人數目介乎501至5 000人的界別分組，每位候選人的選舉開支上限為十六萬元。候選人的選舉開支若超逾法定的最高限額，即屬違法。

陸啟康法官提醒候選人接受的選舉捐贈只可用於是次補選。若補選結束後有關捐贈仍未用盡，則須將餘額轉贈予屬公共性質的慈善機構或慈善信託。另外，根據法例，候選人要在選舉結果刊憲後30天內提交選舉申報書，列明所有候選人本人及其選舉開支代理人招致的所有選舉開支，以及所有收取的選舉捐贈。

選舉廣告規定

若某人的姓名或某組織的名稱、標識或相片在候選人的選舉廣告中出現，令人認為該人或組織支持有關候選人，候選人必須在發布該選舉廣告前取得該人或組織的書面同意。候選人於發布選舉廣告後三個工作天內，必須上載選舉廣告、展示准許、支持同意書等的電子文本到選舉事務處的「中央平台」或候選人自己設辦的公開平台，供公眾查閲，或向選舉主任提交有關文件。候選人如未能遵守有關規定，即屬違法。

此外，廉政公署的代表於簡介會向候選人詳細講解《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》，加深他們對構成舞弊或非法行為的認識；而香港郵政的代表亦於會上向候選人介紹免費郵遞服務的安排。

Election Committee Subsector By-elections' candidates briefed on electoral legislation and guidelines (with photos),2025-08-18 21:35,2025-08-18 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800405.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Electoral Affairs Commission:

 The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission, Mr Justice David Lok, conducted a briefing for the candidates of the 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections tonight (August 18) on the electoral arrangements, the guidelines on election-related activities and important points to note in running their election campaigns to ensure that the By-elections will be conducted in an open, honest and fair manner.

Mr Justice Lok said at the briefing, ""The nomination period for the ECSS By-elections closed on August 4. The Candidate Eligibility Review Committee has published the notices in the Gazette earlier with the names of 100 validly nominated candidates, as well as the names of 10 validly nominated nominees as Election Committee members.""

Mr Justice Lok said that for the By-elections, there are six contested subsectors, involving 28 candidates, who will contest in the ECSS By-elections to be held on September 7 for 21 seats. The Returning Officers (ROs) have determined the order of the names of candidates appearing on a ballot paper by drawing lots on August 12. The candidate numbers for the candidates concerned to be printed on ballot papers are listed on the Gazette notices published on August 12.

 At the briefing, Mr Justice Lok highlighted the arrangements and points to note of the By-elections that are related to the candidates.

No canvassing zone and no staying zone

On the polling day, a certain area outside each polling station will be designated as a no canvassing zone to ensure that voters can gain access to the polling stations without interference. A no staying zone will also be designated outside the entrance and exit of a polling station. No one is allowed to stay in the no staying zone or be allowed to canvass for votes or conduct ""de-facto canvassing"" such as making hand gestures and greetings in the no canvassing zone.

The presiding officer will request the person who has committed such prohibited acts within these zones to leave. If the person concerned refuses to abide by the order, he or she may be evicted by enforcement officers or authorised persons.

Central counting

Central counting will be adopted for the By-elections. Once the poll is closed, the ballot boxes will be delivered to the central counting station at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. The ROs will supervise the counting process with the assistance of Assistant ROs and counting staff. Questionable ballot papers will be determined by the ROs on site, and their determination will be final. Any objection raised against the ROs' determination will be filed in record, and the candidates may make an appeal in accordance with legal procedures.

Video-recording facilities will be installed at the central counting station. Candidates, election agents and counting agents may enter the central counting station and observe the count at designated areas of the counting zone. Members of the public and media may also enter the central counting station to observe the count, but they are not allowed to enter the counting zone. A notice setting out the maximum capacity of the public area will be displayed outside the central counting station.

Announcement of election results

Once the counting of votes is completed and verified by the Statistical Information Centre, the RO will make known the counting results to the candidates and their agents present at the desk for determination of questionable ballot papers at the central counting station. If none of the candidates or agents present request a recount of votes, the RO will thereupon announce the election results. If, according to the counting result, there remain vacancies to be filled and the remaining candidates with the highest number of votes have an equal number of votes, the RO shall determine the result of the election by drawing lots in accordance with the legislation. Later that evening, the elected candidates will be invited to receive applause on stage of the Media Centre.

The election results will be displayed outside the central counting station and published via press releases and the election website (www.elections.gov.hk).

Digitalisation of election forms

Electronic copies are introduced for most election forms for the By-elections. Candidates may submit the relevant election forms via the REO e-Form Upload Platform and the Central Platform for Election Advertisements. However, some of the forms, such as the Return and Declaration of Election Expenses and Election Donations (Election Return), or forms with statutory declaration, are still required under the existing laws or other requirements to be submitted in paper form.

Mr Justice Lok reminded the candidates that once the electronic forms are submitted through the platforms concerned, notifications of confirmation will be issued by the respective platforms via email or mobile phone SMS message. With the receipt of the notifications, there is no need to submit the forms using other means again.

Election expenses and donations

 The law stipulates that election expenses are the expenses used for the purpose of promoting or prejudicing the election of a candidate. Only candidates and their election expense agents may incur election expenses, otherwise it is an illegal conduct.

To ensure candidates are contesting on a level playing field, a maximum limit of election expenses is set for each subsector: the maximum amount of election expenses for a candidate belonging to a subsector with the number of voters fewer than 500 is $100,000, while that for a candidate belonging to a subsector with the number of voters ranging from 501 to 5 000 is $160,000. It is an offence for a candidate to incur election expenses in excess of the prescribed maximum limit.

Mr Justice Lok reminded the candidates that the election donations received can only be used for the By-elections. If there are unspent or unused election donations after the By-elections, the unspent or unused portion of the donations must be given to a charitable institution or trust of a public character. In addition, candidates are required by law to submit an Election Return within 30 days after the gazettal of the election results to declare all election expenses incurred by the candidate and his/her election expense agents, as well as all election donations received.

Election advertisements

 If the name, logo or a pictorial representation of a person or an organisation appears in the election advertisement of a candidate as an indication of support from that person or organisation, the candidate must obtain the written consent from that person or organisation before the publication of the election advertisement. Candidates must upload the electronic copies of the election advertisements and the permission, consent of support, etc, onto the REO's Central Platform or the candidate's platform for public inspection within three working days after the publication of the election advertisements. Candidates may also submit the relevant materials to the ROs. It is an offence if a candidate fails to comply with the requirement.

At the briefing, a representative from the Independent Commission Against Corruption also briefed the candidates about the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance to enhance their understanding of the acts that may constitute corrupt or illegal conducts, whereas a representative from Hongkong Post provided to the candidates a brief overview of the arrangements for free postage service for election mail.

 Information on the By-elections is available on the election website (www.elections.gov.hk). The video of the candidate briefing will also be uploaded to the election website and the YouTube channel of RTHK (www.youtube.com/@RTHK) later (search ""2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections Briefing Session for Candidates"" to watch)."

CS: Further enhancing collaboration between departments of Hong Kong and Mainland port authorities (with photos),2025-08-18 20:00,2025-08-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800910.htm,"The number of passenger trips between Hong Kong and Shenzhenhas recorded new highs over and over again in the past weekends, and the total cross-boundary passenger traffic on August 10 (Sunday) reached 1.34 million, surpassing all previous records. The Liantang Port/Heung Yuen Wai boundary control point (BCP) in particular is a popular choice among Mainland tour groups. During peak hours, some Mainland tour groups had to wait for a longer time on the Shenzhen side before crossing the boundary into Hong Kong. With the implementation of multipronged measures, the waiting time for both outbound and inbound travellers at the Hong Kong BCP is less than 15 minutes.

The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, visited Shenzhen this morning (August 18) to meet with the Mayor of the Shenzhen Municipal Government, Mr Qin Weizhong, to exchange views on further enhancing communication and co-ordination between departments of Hong Kong and the Mainland at BCPs, with a view to better addressing the increasing demand for cross-boundary travel. Also attending the meeting were the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; the Director of Immigration, Mr Benson Kwok; and the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat.

Mr Chan Kwok-ki shared that the HKSAR Government has been proactively preparing for peak weekend passenger traffic, including operating additional counters and e-Channels, as well as setting up temporary counters at BCPs. Through flexible manpower deployment, all clearance counters and kiosks at busy BCPs are operated to ease passenger and vehicular flows, ensuring smooth and orderly immigration clearance.

At the meeting, both sides agreed that government departments of the two places at BCPs will strengthen communication and co-operation further, and plan ahead in response to the latest trends. Both sides will also reinforce the existing joint notification mechanism to improve communication, information sharing and dissemination, with the aim of enhancing the clearance capacity of BCPs. Given the popularity of the Liantang Port/Heung Yuen Wai BCP among Mainland tour groups, and the concentrated arrival of these groups at weekends, both sides will actively explore ways to strengthen strategic communication and collaboration and further share operational experience with a view to enhancing the experience of Mainland tour groups crossing the boundary into Hong Kong.

Noting that the number of cross-boundary passenger trips between Hong Kong andShenzhencontinues to hit record highs, Mr Chan Kwok-ki said that not only does this fully reflect the mutual engagement between the people of Hong Kong andShenzhen, but it also continuously injects momentum into the economic development of both places. He expressed his gratitude to the Shenzhen Municipal Government for its ongoing and strong support for BCP operations. He also thanked relevant departments of the two places at BCPs for their long-term and close co-operation in managing every peak travel period together.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-18 19:53,2025-08-18 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800909.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 18), no new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures, especially upon returning to Hong Kong from regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Individuals experiencing symptoms such as fever or acute joint pain should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors of their travel history.

Analysis of imported cases

""Hong Kong has recorded nine imported CF cases this year, involving six males and three females aged between 8 and 79 years (median age: 31). Individuals of all age groups are susceptible to infection. Five cases involved individuals who had travelled to Foshan in Guangdong Province during the incubation period, while four involved individuals had travelled to Bangladesh. The public should be aware that, in addition to Foshan in Guangdong Province, many countries worldwide are currently experiencing CF outbreaks. It is essential to check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad. Three patients developed symptoms before returning to Hong Kong and the remaining six patients developed symptoms between the first and the fifth day after returning. Therefore, individuals returning from affected areas should continue to monitor their health. Regarding symptoms, all patients experienced fever, and the vast majority (eight cases) reported joint pain, which typically appeared on the same day or the day after the onset of fever. The most commonly affected areas were the wrists, elbows, knees and ankles. Members of the public who experience these typical symptoms after returning to Hong Kong from a region where CF is prevalent should seek medical attention immediately and inform their doctors of their travel history. The public should not self-medicate, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), to prevent aggravating the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

""Genetic analysis by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch indicated that an imported case from Foshan belonged to the Central African lineage of the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype, which is the same as the viral strain currently circulating in Guangdong. Meanwhile, an imported case from Bangladesh belonged to the Indian Ocean lineage of the ECSA genotype. These two sublineages carry key genetic mutations that enhance the virus's adaptability and transmission efficiency in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, thereby accelerating the spread of the CF virus. The CHP's genetic analysis showed that Aedes albopictus mosquitoes can effectively transmit the currently circulating CF virus. If imported cases are bitten by mosquitoes during the infectious period, there is a risk of local transmission. Therefore, mosquito prevention and control efforts are of the utmost importance. Whether in town or travelling abroad, it is important to maintain environmental hygiene, take mosquito prevention and control measures, and adopt personal protective measures. Scientific research indicates that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected individuals can transmit the CF virus to mosquitoes through bites. Residents returning to Hong Kong from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should continue to take measures to prevent mosquito bites for 14 days,"" he added.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the patients, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspectionof the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHP website.

Dr Edwin Tsui reminded members of the public to adopt precautions during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

個案涉及一名患有自身疾病的約兩個月大女嬰，她於八月十三日出現發燒及昏睡，同日被帶往瑪麗醫院急症室求醫，留院治療後，昨日（八月十七日）已康復出院。

病人的腦脊液樣本經化驗後，證實對腸病毒呈陽性反應。臨床診斷為腦膜炎。

衞生防護中心初步調查顯示，病人在一間特殊幼兒中心居住，於潛伏期內沒有外遊記錄。涉事的特殊幼兒中心近日曾出現兩宗手足口病個案，涉及一名兩個月及一名六個月大的女童。她們自八月十五日起出現口腔潰瘍、手腳出現皮疹及發燒。她們就醫後被診斷感染手足口病，須留院治療，現時情況穩定，沒有出現併發症。

衞生防護中心人員已到涉事特殊幼兒中心視察，並建議職員作出感染控制及預防措施。該院舍的其他兒童和職員現正接受醫學監察。中心會繼續調查個案。

手足口病是一種常見於兒童的疾病，通常由腸病毒引起。腸病毒感染是透過直接接觸病人的鼻或喉嚨分泌而傳播，感染腸病毒的兒童應留在家中，直至病癒才可回校上課，以免感染其他兒童。市民亦應保持警覺和採取以下預防措施：


飯前、如廁後及處理嬰兒的尿片後，應徹底洗手；
咳嗽或打噴嚏時，應掩蓋鼻口；
保持室內空氣流通；及

CHP investigates case of severe paediatric enterovirus infection,2025-08-18 19:49,2025-08-18 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800923.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (Aug 18) investigating a case of severe paediatric enterovirus (EV) infection, and reminded the public to observe good hand, personal and environmental hygiene.

The case involves an approximately two-month-old female infant with underlying illnesses. On August 13, she developed fever and became lethargic. She was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital on the same day, where she was admitted for treatment. She recovered and was discharged yesterday (August 17).

  A laboratory test of her cerebrospinal fluid specimen was positive for EV. The clinical diagnosis was meningitis.

  Preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the patient resides in a residential special child care centre and had no travel history during the incubation period. Recently, the special child care centre concerned reported two cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) involving two girls, one aged 2 months and the other 6 months. Since August 15, they developed oral ulcers, rashes on their hands or feet as well as fever. After seeking medical attention, they were diagnosed with HFMD. Both patients required hospitalisation, and are in stable condition without complications.

The CHP officers have inspected the special child care centre and advised the staff on necessary infection control and preventive measures. Other children and staff at the facility are under medical surveillance. The CHP will continue to investigate the case.

  HFMD is a common disease in children caused by EV. EV infection is transmitted by direct contact with the nasal and throat secretions of an infected person. Children with EV infection should stay at home until they have recovered to avoid infecting other children. The public should be vigilant and observe the following preventive measures:


Wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet and changing diapers;
Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing;
Maintain good indoor ventilation; and
Thoroughly clean toys or appliances contaminated by nasal or oral secretions.

The meeting co-ordinated various departments in formulating specific implementation measures on issues of local concern and continuously reviewed the work progress and performance.

 Mr Cheuk said, ""In accordance with the overall strategies set by the Steering Committee, all departments have intensified their efforts to address various district issues, fully carried out improvement measures, achieved phased results and effectively responded to the needs of the public. The Task Force will continue to co-ordinate departments in closely monitoring the implementation of these measures, evaluating their effectiveness, and making adjustments and enhancements as needed to create a high-quality living environment for the public.""

 The Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration has formulated strategies for 12 district issues (Note), including various measures to strengthen community support. These initiatives aim to unite community efforts and comprehensively enhance the public's sense of fulfilment and well-being. At the meeting, the Task Force followed up on the implementation progress and outcomes of relevant initiatives. These include: the Labour and Welfare Bureau is exploring an integration of databases by the Housing Department and the Social Welfare Department (SWD) to identify the high-risk hidden elderly, and the SWD has taken the lead in deploying care teams to visit/reach out to these elderly households in Kwun Tong and Sha Tin Districts and referring them to additional support services as necessary since July; further to the second phase of the environmental hygiene legislative amendments, which came into effect yesterday (August 17), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will issue a Notice of Elimination of Vermin to a person responsible for the management of premises at suitable buildings (e.g. property management companies), with the maximum penalties for non-compliance increased to $25,000 plus a daily fine of $450; as of last month, the FEHD has issued 4 300 ""Statutory Nuisance Notices"" to property owners/occupants across Hong Kong for the environmental nuisance caused by air conditioner water dripping, with the vast majority of cases already rectified; and all departments continue to advance 11 thematic planting projects scheduled for implementation within this year.

 The Task Force also reviewed at the meeting the arrangements for displaying publicity materials to celebrate the 76th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China. Photos of the publicity materials and decorations will be uploaded to a thematic website dedicated to National Day celebrations for public viewing and widespread publicity.

 Mr Cheuk thanked all departments for their dedicated efforts in advancing the above work and achieving positive outcomes. He urged all departments to continue actively following up on various livelihood-related issues, addressing the concerns and difficulties of the public through concrete actions to build a better community together.

Note: The 12 key issues are: (1) expanding after-school care and enhancing support for parents; (2) caring for the elderly and enhancing community support; (3) fostering clean markets and mobilising the community to participate in anti-rodent work; (4) enhancing public order and combating crimes on all fronts; (5) improving pedestrian facilities and ensuring road safety; (6) enhancing the community environment and strengthening local characteristics ; (7) improving the environment of public housing estates and creating comfortable homes; (8) caring for the elderly and promoting digital inclusion; (9) improving the waiting environment at public transport interchanges to enhance the travel experience; (10) combating air-conditioner water dripping to improve community environment; (11) cleaning pedestrian walkways to improve city streets; (12) strengthening thematic planting."
Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme to cover all nine Mainland cities in GBA,2025-08-18 19:07,2025-08-18 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800805.htm,"  The Government announced today (August 18) that the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme (Pilot Scheme) will be further extended this month to three Mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area (GBA), namely Jiangmen, Huizhou and Zhaoqing, achieving full coverage of the nine Mainland cities in the GBA. Additionally, two new service points will open in Shenzhen. Eligible Hong Kong elderly persons will be able to use Elderly Health Care Vouchers (EHCVs) to pay for outpatient healthcare services at designated departments at these five additional service points within this month.

ãã""The Government launched the Pilot Scheme in 2024 to extend the coverage of EHCVs to seven integrated medical/dental institutions in the GBA, covering Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Dongguan and Shenzhen. Following the successful implementation of the Pilot Scheme, in May this year, the Government announced an extension of the Pilot Scheme to include 12 additional medical institutions. This expansion extended the Pilot Scheme from the core cities along Zhujiang to GBA cities that were previously not covered. Additionally, the Pilot Scheme included Chinese medicine hospitals for the first time, providing eligible elderly persons with additional choices in healthcare services. The number of pilot medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme will increase significantly to 19. Together with the two existing service points operated by the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, a total of 21 service points in the GBA (see Annex I) will be allowed to use EHCVs to pay for outpatient healthcare services at designated departments, benefitting more than 1.78 million eligible Hong Kong elderly persons,"" a Government spokesman supplemented.

ãã""The HKSAR Government would like to express its heartfelt gratitude to the Health Commission of Guangdong Province and the health authorities of the relevant cities for their strong support and assistance with the Pilot Scheme. With the five aforementioned medical institutions commencing services this month, the goal announced in 'The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address' to extend the Pilot Scheme to nine Mainland cities in the GBA will be fully achieved. The full coverage of the nine cities under the Pilot Scheme marks another milestone in policy innovation and cross-boundary medical collaboration.""

ããDetails of the five newly added medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme/service points are as follows:




Services launch date
GBA City
Name of newly added medical institution/ new service point under the Pilot Scheme


August 21
			(Thursday)
Jiangmen
Jiangmen Central Hospital (JMCH)


Huizhou
Huizhou Central People's Hospital (HZCPH)


August 28
			(Thursday)
Zhaoqing
The First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing (FPHZQ)


Shenzhen
Peking University Shenzhen Hospital (PKUSZH)


Shenzhen (Qianhai)
Shenzhen Hospital of Southern Medical University (SHSMU)




ããFor JMCH, EHCVs are applicable for outpatient healthcare services provided by 16 designated departments, namely the Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Surgery, Department of Gynecology, Department of Orthopedics, Department of Ophthalmology, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Dental Department, Emergency Department, Department of Infectious Disease, Department of Dermatology, Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Department of Nutrition, Health Management Center and Department of Nursing.

ããFor HZCPH, EHCVs are applicable for outpatient healthcare services provided by 10 designated departments, namely the Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Surgery, Department of Gynecology, Department of Orthopedics, Department of Ophthalmology, Department of Stomatology, Traumatic Emergency Center, Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Health Examination Center and Department of Nutrition.

ããFor FPHZQ, EHCVs are applicable for outpatient healthcare services provided by 14 designated departments, namely the Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Surgery, Department of Gynecology, Department of Orthopedics, Department of Ophthalmology, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Department of Stomatology, Emergency Department, Department of Dermatology, Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wound Repair Center, Rehabilitation Department, Weight Management Center and Physical Examination Center.

ããFor PKUSZH, EHCVs are applicable for outpatient healthcare services provided by 14 designated departments, namely the Internal Medicine Department, Surgery Department, Gynecology, Orthopaedics, Ophthalmology Department, Otorhinlaryngology (ENT) Department, Stomatology Department, Dermatology Department, General Medicine Department, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Department, Rehabilitation Department, Nutrition Department, Health Checkup Department and Nurse Specialist Clinic.

ããFor SHSMU, EHCVs are applicable for outpatient healthcare services provided by 12 designated departments, namely the Internal Medicine Department, General Surgery Department, Gynaecology Department, Orthopedic Department, Ophthalmology Department, Otolaryngology (ENT) Department, Stomatology Department, Emergency Department, General Practice Department, Traditional Chinese Medicine Department, Rehabilitation Medicine Department and Health Management Center.

ããThe arrangements for shared use of EHCVs between spouses and the EHCV Pilot Reward Scheme under the EHCV Scheme are equally applicable to JMCH and HZCPH. When an elderly person receives designated primary healthcare outpatient services for health checks, preventive health services, and follow-up/monitoring of long-term conditions at the designated departments, the EHCV spending for that service encounter can be accumulated for the allotment of rewards. Further information and patient visit procedures are set out in Annex II.

 The fees for the healthcare services provided by the pilot medical institutions are denominated in Renminbi. Medical institutions will make EHCV claims for elderly persons, and the EHCV amount deducted in Hong Kong dollars will be calculated according to a monthly updated voucher conversion factor under the EHCV Scheme. The monthly voucher conversion factor under the EHCV Scheme will be displayed at the cashier offices of the medical institutions for reference by the elderly persons.

 ""Elderly persons cannot use EHCVs together with national medical insurance to pay for the fees of the same healthcare service encounter. The scope of using EHCVs on the Mainland is the same as that in Hong Kong, which does not include inpatient services, prepaid healthcare services and day surgery procedures. EHCVs cannot be used solely for the purchase of goods, medication, medical equipment or products, nor can they be redeemed for cash,"" the Government spokesman reminded.

 Hong Kong elderly persons should register with eHealth before using EHCVs at any designated service point in the GBA. To facilitate Hong Kong citizens in using electronic health records (eHRs) across the boundary in a secure manner and to enhance the continuity of healthcare services, the ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" and ""Personal Folder"" functions of the eHealth mobile application (eHealth App) will be extended to the medical institutions concerned starting from the service launch day of the Pilot Scheme (i.e. August 21 and August 28). In addition, elderly persons can also use the eHealth App to check their EHCV balance and usage record, as well as access at any time important information such as their medications, allergies and adverse drug reactions stored in the eHealth App. If elderly persons wish to use EHCVs at the GBA medical institutions but have not yet registered with eHealth, the medical institutions will instantly register them for eHealth upon their consent so that they can use EHCVs right away.

 If elderly persons suspect that the participating medical institutions have violated the EHCV Scheme rules, they can call the EHCV Scheme hotline (2838 2311) to provide relevant information and details to the Health Care Voucher Division of the Department of Health (DH). All suspected cases of violation of the EHCV Scheme rules will be strictly dealt with by the DH. Furthermore, each participating GBA medical institution has set up an enquiry and complaint hotline. Elderly persons can also offer their views to the relevant medical institution or file complaints against the medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme with local municipal or Guangdong provincial health authorities if necessary.

海關人員於七月十五日在香港國際機場截查一名三十一歲抵港男旅客，並在他攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約一萬六千八百支未完稅香煙及三支另類吸煙產品，估計市值共約七萬五千九百元，應課稅值約五萬五千五百元。該名抵港旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

根據《進出口條例》，任何人進口另類吸煙產品即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and importing alternative smoking products (with photo),2025-08-18 18:48,2025-08-18 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800838.htm,"  A male passenger was sentenced to 10 weeks' imprisonment and fined $1,500 at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (August 18) for dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, as well as for importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming male passenger, aged 31, at Hong Kong International Airport on July 15. About 16 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes and three alternative smoking products were seized from his personal baggage with an estimated market value of about $75,900 and a duty potential of about $55,500 in total. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

In terms of shipping and logistics, we are close to the vast hinterland of our country and are also easily accessible to international markets. We will continue to adopt an intermodal transport approach to consolidate and boost our cargo volumes, thereby better utilising and further solidifying Hong Kong's position as an international shipping centre. As for aviation, we engage in differential development with Mainland hub airports to achieve complementary advantages. Hong Kong is also honoured to be the first city outside the Mainland to be served by our country's home-developed aircraft C919. We look forward to further facilitating the expansion of C919 from Hong Kong to overseas markets and will continue to proactively offer support in areas such as aircraft maintenance, talent training, aircraft leasing and sales to promote the entry of home-developed aircraft into the international market.""

  The Task Group on New Medical School received proposals for the establishment of the third medical school this March from three universities, namely Hong Kong Baptist University, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Between May and June, the Task Group held two meetings with the three universities to have in-depth discussions on their proposals. At the last meeting on July 31, the Task Group carried out an overall assessment of the proposals, and initiated the next phase of follow-up work to conduct a thorough study of the funding arrangements and financial sustainability of the proposals. A final recommendation on the establishment of the new medical school is expected to be provided to the Government later this year.

  The Task Group has all along been making public announcements on the latest progress through press releases, and will continue to take forward the evaluation exercise at full speed in a rigorous, impartial and professional manner."

輸入個案的分析

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港今年累計錄得九宗輸入個案，涉及六男和三女，年齡介乎8至79歲（中位數：31歲），各個年齡組別人士均有機會受到感染。五宗病例在潛伏期內曾前往廣東省佛山市，四宗病例則曾前往孟加拉國。市民應留意現時除廣東省佛山外，全球多國正爆發基孔肯亞熱，外遊前必須注意當地情況。三名病人在返港前已發病，另外六名病人在返港後第一至五天發病，因此從受影響地區返港後仍需繼續觀察身體狀況。病徵方面，所有病人均出現發燒，絕大部分（八宗）病例出現關節疼痛，通常在發燒開始的當天或一天後出現。最常受影響的部位包括手腕、肘部、膝蓋和腳踝。市民若從基孔肯亞熱流行地區返港後出現上述典型病徵，應立即求醫並告知外遊史，並應避免使用非類固醇消炎止痛藥（如布洛芬），以免加劇出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致『雷爾氏綜合症』，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。」

徐樂堅醫生補充：「公共衞生化驗服務處的基因分析顯示佛山輸入的個案屬東／中／南非基因型的中非亞譜系，與廣東省現時流行的病毒株一樣。另外，孟加拉國輸入的個案屬東／中／南非基因型的印度洋亞譜系。上述兩種亞譜系帶有關鍵基因突變，增強病毒在白紋伊蚊中的適應性和傳播效率，從而加速了基孔肯雅病毒的傳播。中心的基因分析顯示白紋伊蚊可有效傳播現時流行的基孔肯雅病毒，輸入個案如在傳染期被蚊子叮咬，有機會導致本地傳播。因此，防蚊控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。科學研究顯示，即使沒有病徵或尚未出現病徵的感染者被蚊叮咬，亦有機會把病毒傳給蚊子。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續採取措施防止被蚊叮咬。」

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

The six Filipino foreign domestic helpers, aged from 34 to 60, were suspected of breaching their conditions of stay by practising dentistry without registration.

The ImmD received a report earlier on that a number of foreign domestic helpers breached their conditions of stay by providing unlicensed dental services. After an in-depth investigation and intelligence analysis, ImmD investigators identified the suspects concerned and conducted an enforcement action yesterday. Upon the enforcement action, ImmD investigators arrested six foreign domestic helper suspects and seized exhibits, including dental equipment and tools for teeth scaling, orthodontic treatments and denture making inside a residential apartment in Sham Shui Po. The investigation is still underway and the ImmD will not rule out the possibility that more persons will be arrested. The ImmD had referred to the relevant department for a follow-up investigation into the suspected violation of the Dentists Registration Ordinance by the foreign domestic workers.

""The helper should only perform domestic duties for the employer specified in the contract. The helper should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employer should not require or allow the helper to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties."""

Inaugural individualised school health reports to be released under extended Whole School Health Programme,2025-08-18 17:45,2025-08-18 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800711.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) announced today (August 18) that it will release the inaugural ""School Health Reports and Recommendations"" (health reports) tailored to each participating school under the Whole School Health Programme (WSHP) tomorrow (August 19). The DH also commended 11 outstanding schools that have been upgraded to ""Advanced Schools"" under the WSHP.

  ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" announced that the WSHP would be strengthened and extended to cover all primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong. Based on the overall health status of students in each school, health reports will also be compiled for each participating school to recommend targeted school-based health promotion measures for physical activities, meals and other matters, to improve students' physical and psychological well-being.

During the 2024/25 school year, 808 schools participated in the WSHP, specifically 356 primary schools, 404 secondary schools, and 48 special schools. Of these, 339 were classified as ""Pledged Schools"", 458 as ""Action Schools"", and 11 as ""Advanced Schools"", covering nearly 70 per cent of schools in Hong Kong. The response was enthusiastic.

The Consultant Community Medicine (Family and Student Health) of the DH, Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, expressed gratitude to schools and parents for their support.

""The participating schools have strengthened the implementation of various measures under the Health Promoting School (HPS) framework, which include integrating four major health themes, namely physical activity, healthy eating, mental health and social well-being, into the school curriculum; providing facilities and venues to encourage students to engage in physical activities; providing high-quality physical education lessons; providing a healthy eating environment; setting up a task group to support students and staff members with emotional issues; recording and analysing students' health conditions; establishing a mechanism to assist students at risk of self-harm or suicide; and addressing bullying issues. The results are satisfactory,"" Dr Chuang said.

""The DH would like to take this opportunity to commend all the schools that have actively participated in and supported the WSHP, especially the 11 outstanding schools that have been upgraded from 'Pledged Schools' to 'Action Schools' and ultimately to 'Advanced Schools' (see Annex). These Advanced Schools have consistently implemented the HPS framework in a comprehensive manner, and have proactively implemented additional measures, such as setting up dedicated task forces to formulate and review healthy school policies, providing staff with training opportunities related to health, and inviting parents and community partners to provide suggestions on the development of a healthy school. They have also shared their experience and strategies for implementing the HPS with other schools through various channels,"" she added.

The WSHP is divided into three phases. First, the DH provides participating schools with guidelines and a checklist, referencing the Health Promoting School framework advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO), to help them systematically review and formulate health promotion measures. Next, the DH will conduct an in-depth analysis of the annual health assessment data of students attending Student Health Service Centres in the 2023/24 school year and the checklists submitted by the schools. Finally, based on these assessments, the DH will compile a health report and provide targeted health promotion recommendations tailored to each school's specific circumstances to assist schools in establishing priorities and strategies for their school-based health promotion work.

The health reports cover the above-mentioned four major health themes and six key factors of HPS, namely healthy school policies, schools' physical environment, schools' social environment, community links, action competencies for healthy living, and school health care and promotion services.

The DH will distribute the health reports to all participating schools tomorrow. Between mid-August and late September, the DH's professional healthcare teams will visit each participating school to provide in-depth explanations of the health reports, enabling the schools to implement relevant health promotion work in the new school year.

The DH will continue to actively promote the WSHP to all primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, and will collaborate with stakeholders to support schools to gradually upgrade from ""Pledged Schools"" to ""Action Schools"", and ultimately to ""Advanced Schools"" which have fully implemented the HPS framework. This will help realise the WHO's vision of ""making every school a health-promoting school"".

â""Evidence from international research shows that the implementation of the HPS framework can bring about a positive impact on the health of students, such as effectively reducing the risk of smoking among students, reducing bullying cases, helping to improve the body mass index of students, as well as increasing their physical activity and intake of fruits and vegetables. I would like to appeal to schools which have not yet joined the WSHP to visit the DH's designated webpage and sign the â""Whole School Health Charter"",or call 3163 4574 to contact the DH's Health Promoting School Division to register for the WSHP,"" Dr Chuang added.

Furthermore, the Student Health Service Centres of the DH provide annual health assessment services to all primary and secondary students in Hong Kong to identify students with health or behavioral problems at an early stage for timely advice and intervention. In addition to letting individual student know their own health condition, the DH will regularly analyse the data obtained to monitor the overall health condition and relevant trends of local students, and announce relevant findings to the public to raise their awareness on student health.

For more information on the list of participating schools and the WSHP, members of the public may visit the DH's designated webpage."
擴展「全校園健康計劃」首發「一校一健康報告」,2025-08-18 17:44,2025-08-18 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800710.htm,"衞生署今日（八月十八日）宣布，明日（八月十九日）將首次向每所參與「全校園健康計劃」（計劃）的學校發放「度身訂造」的《學校健康報告與建議》（《健康報告》），並表揚11所晉升成為最優秀的「卓越學校」。

《行政長官2024年施政報告》宣布強化及擴展計劃至全港中、小學，並為每所參與學校編製「一校一健康報告」，針對每所學校的整體學生健康狀況，建議促進健康的校本措施，以改善體能活動和飲食等安排，從而提升學生身心健康。

在二○二四／二五學年，全港共有808所學校（包括356所小學、404所中學和48所特殊學校）參與計劃，當中339所為「承諾學校」、458所為「行動學校」、11所為「卓越學校」，涵蓋近七成全港學校，反應踴躍。

衞生署社會醫學顧問醫生（家庭及學生健康）張竹君醫生感謝學校及家長的支持。

她說︰「參與計劃的學校加強落實多項《健康促進學校框架》的措施，包括將四大健康主題（即體能活動、健康飲食、精神健康和社交健康）融入學校課程、提供設施及場地鼓勵學生進行體能活動、提供高質素的體育課程、提供健康飲食環境、成立專責小組支援學生和員工的情緒問題、記錄和分析學生的健康狀況，以及建立機制協助有自毀或自殺風險的學生和處理學生的欺凌問題，表現令人滿意。」

「衞生署藉此表揚所有積極參與和支持計劃的學校，尤其是當中11所由『承諾學校』發展成為『行動學校』，繼而晉升成為表現優秀的『卓越學校』（見附件），它們持續全面落實《健康促進學校框架》，並進一步主動推行了其他措施，例如成立專責小組制定和檢討健康學校政策、提供機會讓員工參與相關健康主題的培訓，以及邀請家長和社區夥伴就健康校園發展提供建議等，並以不同渠道與其他學校分享實踐健康促進學校的經驗及策略。」

計劃分三個階段。首先，衞生署參考世界衞生組織（世衞）所倡議的《健康促進學校框架》，為參與學校提供指引和檢視表，協助學校有系統地檢視和制定健康促進措施。其後，衞生署會根據該校學生於二○二三／二四學年在學生健康服務中心進行的周年健康評估結果和學校遞交的檢視表進行深入分析。最後，綜合以上評估，衞生署針對每所學校的不同情況，逐一編製《健康報告》及提供針對性健康促進建議，供校方參考以訂立校本健康促進工作的發展優次和策略。

《健康報告》涵蓋上述四大健康主題及六大「健康促進學校」發展領域（即健康學校政策、學校環境、校風與人際關係、家校與社區聯繫、健康生活技能與實踐及學校保健與健康促進服務）。

衞生署明日向每所參與學校發放《健康報告》，並安排醫護團隊在本月中旬至下月底，到學校深入講解報告內容，以便校方在新學年落實相關的健康促進工作。

衞生署會繼續積極向全港中、小學推動計劃，並聯同持份者提供支援，促使學校循序漸進地由「承諾學校」發展成為「行動學校」，及最終晉升為已全面落實《健康促進學校框架》的「卓越學校」，以達至世衞「讓每一所學校都成為健康促進學校」的願景。

張竹君醫生補充說：「國際實證研究文獻顯示，學校實施《健康促進學校框架》能夠為學生健康帶來正面影響，例如有效降低學童的吸煙風險、減少欺凌個案、有助改善學生的體重指數，以及增加他們的體能活動和蔬果攝取量。我在此呼籲尚未參加計劃的學校，可瀏覽衞生署專題網頁及簽署《全校園健康約章》，或致電3163 4574聯絡衞生署健康促進學校科報名參與計劃。」

此外，衞生署學生健康服務中心為全港中小學生提供周年健康檢查服務，以及早識別有健康或行為問題的學生，適時提供建議和介入。除了每位學生可了解自身的健康狀況外，衞生署會定期分析取得的數據監測全港學生的整體健康狀況及相關趨勢，並向公眾發放有關資訊，以提高大眾對學生健康的關注。

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-08-18 17:00,2025-08-18 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800740.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（八月十八日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在八月十日至十六日期間，衞生防護中心錄得四宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，全部病人均有長期病患。詳情如下：


74歲男病人，居於東區；
80歲男病人，居於東區；
67歲男病人，居於北區；及
65歲男病人，居於南區。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示四宗個案全部屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這些個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至八月十六日，今年錄得107宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-08-18 17:00,2025-08-18 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800742.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 18) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From August 10 to 16, the CHP recorded four community-acquired LD cases. All of the patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:


A 74-year-old male patient living in Eastern District;
An 80-year-old male patient living in Eastern District;
A 67-year-old male patient living in North District; and
A 65-year-old male patient living in Southern District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that all four cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of August 16, 107 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.


Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


  The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

​九龍灣彩石里「簡約公屋」八月二十五日起接受申請（附圖）,2025-08-18 16:30,2025-08-18 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800672.htm,"房屋局今日（八月十八日）宣布，九龍灣彩石里「簡約公屋」項目將於八月二十五日起接受申請。項目由校舍改建，提供約150個單位，預計二○二六年第一季起陸續入伙。

符合申請資格人士會在八月二十五日或之前陸續收到由房屋局寄出的申請表，於九月十五日或之前交回的申請將會獲優先處理及進行編配，包括彩石里及其他尚有單位的「簡約公屋」項目。曾經遞交申請表的人士，則無需再次提交申請。

房屋局發言人表示：「早前於今年二月開展的第二期『簡約公屋』申請，涵蓋啟德世運道（第一期）、屯門青福里（即屯門第3A區），觀塘順安道及上水彩園路四個項目，反應踴躍，申請者資格審核正陸續進行。除了該四個項目仍繼續接受申請外，有見工程進展順利，預計可於明年第一季入伙，今次決定加推九龍灣彩石里項目，希望提供多一個選擇予有迫切住屋需要的人士。」

發言人續說：「同時，位於元朗攸壆路約2 100個『簡約公屋』單位已在今年六月中全面入伙，而作為第二個落成及首個位於市區的牛頭角彩興路『簡約公屋』項目約2 290個單位亦預期快將完成入伙，充分反映租金便宜、配套服務齊全、居住環境更好的『簡約公屋』項目，相當受有需要的市民歡迎。房屋局剛公布二○二五年第二季公屋綜合輪候時間，一般申請者的綜合輪候時間下降0.2年至5.1年，是二○一八年第一季以來的最低位；而當中『簡約公屋』的一般申請者的輪候時間平均為2.3年，可見『簡約公屋』能快速回應急需改善居住環境家庭的需要。此外，約七成彩興路『簡約公屋』的住戶原先居住在不適切住房，例如『劏房』、天台屋和床位等，他們入住『簡約公屋』後生活即時得以大幅改善，因此我們呼籲有需要而又符合資格的市民盡快遞交申請。」

「根據差餉物業估價署所收集的『劏房』租金資料，二○二四年第三季的全港『劏房』租金中位數約5,500元，而『簡約公屋』的租金中位數約1,300元，我們預計每戶入住『簡約公屋』的居民平均每月可節省租金約4,200元，即30 000個單位的居民於五年間一共可節省超過75億元的租金支出。以相宜租金入住『簡約公屋』的基層市民將大大緩解租金壓力，把節省下來的租金用作其他更有意義的用途。」

九龍灣彩石里「簡約公屋」申請的詳情如下：

（一）優先申請資格：輪候傳統公屋三年或以上，以一般傳統公屋申請住戶的家庭申請者優先。符合資格的人士會陸續收到由房屋局寄出的申請表。

（二）申請日期：在八月二十五日至九月十五日期間交回填妥的申請表將會獲優先處理及進行編配，包括彩石里及其他尚有單位的項目；房屋局在九月十五日後仍會繼續接受申請。

（三）遞交方法：有意的申請者可把填妥的申請表郵寄至香港灣仔告士打道郵政局郵政信箱28222號房屋局「簡約公屋」專責小組辦事處；或於辦公時間內（星期一至星期五上午九時至下午六時，星期六、日及公眾假期除外）放入位於下列地點的文件投遞箱：

九龍橫頭磡南道三號香港房屋委員會客務中心第二層平台「簡約公屋」資訊站

另外，如申請者及家庭成員均已登記「智方便+」，亦可選擇透過掃描申請表上的專屬二維碼填寫、簽署和遞交電子表格。

房屋局會盡快處理收到的申請表並進行編配。為了讓較有需要的家庭優先入住「簡約公屋」，如申請者現時居住在不適切居所、有特殊健康狀況，或家庭成員包括未成年子女、初生嬰兒、長者等，可獲較高的編配優次。

九龍灣彩石里項目提供約150個單位（包括一至二人、三至四人，以及四至五人單位），步行約九分鐘至港鐵彩虹站，附近亦設多條專營巴士及小巴線往返港九及新界不同地區，預計每月租金約1,230元至3,310元（註）。

Light Public Housing at Choi Shek Lane in Kowloon Bay to open for application from August 25 (with photo),2025-08-18 16:30,2025-08-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800678.htm,"ããThe Housing Bureau (HB) today (August 18) announced that the Light Public Housing (LPH) project at Choi Shek Lane, Kowloon Bay, will be open for application from August 25. The project is the renovation of a former school premises, and will provide about 150 units for gradual intake anticipated from the first quarter of 2026 onwards.

ããEligible applicants will receive the application forms by post on or before August 25 sent by the HB in batches. Application forms submitted before September 15 will be handled with priority for allocation, which will include Choi Shek Lane as well as other LPH projects that still have units available. Those who have submitted an application form previously do not need to submit another application.

ããA spokesman for the HB said, ""The Phase 2 LPH application, which was launched earlier in February this year, covers four projects, including Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 1); Tsing Fuk Lane, Tuen Mun (i.e. Tuen Mun Area 3A); Shun On Road, Kwun Tong; and Choi Yuen Road, Sheung Shui. The response has been overwhelming, with eligibility verification for applicants being conducted progressively. In view of the satisfactory construction progress, apart from the said four projects still available for application, we decided to launch the Choi Shek Lane, Kowloon Bay, project, the intake of which is expected to commence in the first quarter of next year, in order to provide an extra option for those with an urgent housing need.""

  The spokesman added, ""Meanwhile, the tenant intake for the first LPH project at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long, providing about 2,100 units, was fully completed in mid-June this year. The second LPH project at Choi Hing Road, Ngau Tau Kok, which provides about 2,290 units, is the first project in an urban area with a full intake expected to be completed soon. This fully demonstrates that with affordable rent, comprehensive facilities and services, as well as a better living environment, LPH projects are highly popular among residents in need. The HB just announced the Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing (CWT) for the second quarter of 2025. The CWT for general applicants has decreased by 0.2 years to 5.1 years, which is the lowest since the first quarter of 2018, among which, the waiting time for general applicants of LPH is 2.3 years on average, showing that LPH can quickly address the urgent demand for improving living conditions of households in need. Moreover, about 70 per cent of the residents at Choi Hing Road LPH previously resided in inadequate housing, such as sub-divided units (SDUs), rooftop houses and bedspaces, etc. Their livelihood has greatly improved right after moving into LPH. We urge eligible residents in need to submit their applications as soon as possible.

  ""Based on the data from the Rating and Valuation Department about the rent of SDUs, the median rent for SDUs across Hong Kong in the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $5,500, while the median rent for LPH is about $1,300. We estimate that each household can save about $4,200 on rent per month after moving into LPH. That represents a total of over $7.5 billion on rental savings for households of 30,000 units in five years. By moving into LPH with an affordable rent, not only can the grassroot residents face a much lower rental burden, they can also utilise the saved rent for other meaningful purposes.""

  Details of the LPH application process for Choi Shek Lane, Kowloon Bay, are as follows:

(1) Eligibility for priority application: general applicants who have been on the waiting list for traditional Public Rental Housing (PRH) for three years or more are eligible, with priority given to family applicants. Those meeting the eligibility criteria will receive by post the application forms sent by the HB in batches.

(2) Application period: applicants who submit duly completed application forms between August 25 and September 15 will be handled with priority for allocation, including Choi Shek Lane and other LPH projects which still have units available. From September 15 onwards, the HB will continue to accept applications.

(3) Submission methods: interested applicants may submit their duly completed application forms by post to PO Box of the Dedicated Team on Light Public Housing of the Housing Bureau (PO Box 28222, Gloucester Road Post Office, Wan Chai, Hong Kong); or by depositing them into drop-in boxes during office hours (from 9am to 6pm, Mondays to Fridays, except Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) at the following locations:

Light Public Housing Information Counter at Podium Level 2, Hong Kong Housing Authority Customer Service Centre, 3 Wang Tau Hom South Road, Kowloon; and
Office of the Dedicated Team on Light Public Housing at Room 801, 8/F, Revenue Tower, 5 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong.


ããIn addition, if the applicant and all family members have registered for ""iAM Smart+"", they may opt to complete, sign and submit the e-Form by scanning the exclusive QR code pre-printed on the application form.

ããThe HB will process the application forms received as soon as possible and make arrangements for the allocation. To give priority to those families in need to move into LPH, if the applicants are currently living in inadequate housing; having special medical conditions; or having minor-age children, newborns, elderly persons, etc, in the family, they will be given a higher priority for LPH allocation.

  The Choi Shek Lane, Kowloon Bay, project provides about 150 units (including units for one to two persons, three to four persons and four to five persons), and is about nine minutes to the Choi Hung MTR Station on foot, with a number of franchised bus and minibus routes in the vicinity travelling to/from various places in Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories. The estimated monthly rent ranges from about $1,230 to $3,310 (Note).

For more information about LPH applications, please refer to the enclosed LPH Promotional Pamphlet, or browse the LPH website of the HB (www.hb.gov.hk/eng/lph). For enquiries, please call 3464 0700, or send email to lphapp@hb.gov.hk.

Note: Rents may vary depending on the unit size and the district. The rental level is set at around 90 per cent of the rent of newly completed traditional PRH in the same district. Having regard to the biennial rent review of traditional PRH, the rent of LPH will be adjusted accordingly."
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-08-18 16:30,2025-08-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/18/P2025081800707.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 15 to noon today (August 18), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 221 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website
(www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 158 695 samples of food imported from Japan (including 104 002 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 36 048 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

非常高興在八月份來到前海，跟大家一起參與今天香港社福界心連心大行動（心連心）共創明天在前海國際交流中心的活動。心連心、「共創明『Teen』」和前海其實有共通之處，都是前沿創新的場地。「心連心」的平台和「共創明『Teen』」的整個大平台均是這屆政府提出的兩個創新之處。「共創明『Teen』」是在行政長官李家超指導下提出的項目，目的是為基層青少年，尤其是在初中時期的青少年，提供一個可以讓他們更好發揮潛力、創造自己明天的平台。

主要的目標是在香港這個基礎上開始，初期主要是在香港進行參觀，帶他們去增廣見聞，很快我們就有了認識祖國的活動，去了不少城市參觀。但我們這次來到前海特別有意義，因為前海標誌是國家對外開放最起眼的地方，有創新、獨特的地方。我期待通過今天的參觀訪問活動，同學們可以大開眼界，深深感受國家的發展和動力。心連心也是在國家和政府大力支持下成立，透過這個重要平台，讓我們社福界可以團結一致，更好地服務社會。

過去三年心連心取得巨大的成功，今天是心連心和「共創明『Teen』」連在一起的活動，意義更為重大，而且在前海成立十五周年之際，來到這裏參觀訪問，我覺得這是恰逢其時。我期待在往後的日子裏，有更多的活動可以讓香港和前海聯手打造一些新的合作項目，無論是由勞工及福利局主導，還是人才的項目，或是社福界的項目，如「共創明『Teen』」這些幫助基層青年的項目，我都期待香港和前海可以聯手推動發展。

當中我相信通過我們的創新精神，一定能掌握新的路線，利用好香港「一國兩制」的優勢和前海的最新發展，帶來無限的貢獻。我也榮幸能親身見證國家新的發展，也期待大家在開眼界之餘也要做好自己，打穩自己的基礎，善用特區政府和國家提供的平台，好好的鍛鍊自己，目標是長大以後為國家和香港作出貢獻。我在這裏預祝活動圓滿成功，也感謝前海管理局和中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室為我們提供的大力支持。"
