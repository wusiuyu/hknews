​一名入境旅客進口未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2026-01-10 16:00,2026-01-10 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000555.htm,"一名入境旅客因進口未完稅香煙及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（一月十日）在九龍城裁判法院被判處監禁六個月和罰款一千元。

海關人員昨日（一月九日）在香港國際機場截查一名四十三歲抵港女旅客，並在她的個人行李內檢獲四萬八千四百支未完稅香煙，市值二十一萬七千八百元，應課稅值約十六萬元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for importing of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2026-01-10 16:00,2026-01-10 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000560.htm,"​An incoming passenger was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts today (January 10) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming female passenger, aged 43, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (January 9), and seized 48 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of $217,800 and a duty potential of about $160,000 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-10 03:55,2026-01-10 04:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000106.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月十日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

Employers and employees should take precautions during cold weather,2026-01-10 03:55,2026-01-10 04:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000108.htm,"Attention duty announcers, radio and TV stations:

Please broadcast the following special announcement immediately, and repeat it at frequent intervals when the Cold Weather Warning is in force:

  The Labour Department reminds employers that as the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions such as reminding employees who have to work outdoors or in remote areas to wear appropriately warm clothing, and make arrangements for employees to rotate from outdoor to indoor or sheltered work sites as far as possible. Employees should take note of the weather report, wear appropriately warm clothing and be mindful of their health conditions. They should notify their supervisors and seek medical help immediately if feeling unwell, such as having cold limbs and body shivering."
CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-10 03:55,2026-01-10 04:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000102.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 10) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

CHP investigates two suspected food poisoning clusters with epidemiological linkage,2026-01-09 22:47,2026-01-09 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900918.htm," The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (January 9) investigating two epidemiologically linked suspected food poisoning clusters affecting 39 students from two primary schools. The students developed symptoms after consuming lunch provided by the Sailing Boat Luncheon Production Limited. The CHP reminded the public to maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

 The first cluster involves 12 boys and 16 girls aged between 6 and 11. They attend a primary school in Sham Shui Po. The investigation revealed that the affected students developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea approximately three to 31 hours after eating school lunch containing fish, chicken cutlets, sauce, garnish and rice, which was provided by the abovementioned school lunch supplier on January 6.

 While investigating the first cluster, the CHP of the DH traced the supply chain of the school lunch supplier and identified another cluster, involving eight boys and three girls, aged between 10 and 12, who attend a primary school in Diamond Hill. The investigation revealed that the affected students developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea approximately five to 15 hours after eating lunch containing chicken, cervelat sausage, sauce and fusilli at school yesterday (January 8). The food concerned was also provided by the same school lunch supplier.

None of the affected students required hospitalisation and they are all currently in stable condition.

 Officers of the CHP and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch, have inspected the food factory of the school lunch supplier concerned and the kitchen of the first school. They inspected the food storage, the food preparation process and environmental hygiene. Investigation revealed that some food items, such as meat and sauce, were prepared at the food factory, while the other food items, such as rice and garnish, were prepared at the school kitchen. It is suspected that some food items were prepared too early in advance. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to suspend operations for thorough cleaning and disinfection, improve food preparation process and hygiene standards. The CFS has provided food safety and environmental hygiene education to the staff. Food and environmental samples were collected for testing.

The investigation of the CHP and CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and
Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet.

"Public healthcare fees and charges reform strengthens protection for poor, acute, serious and critical patients number of waiver recipients is 3.5 times annual total of previous year",2026-01-09 20:01,2026-01-09 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900430.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson announced today (January 9) that in addition to the 600 000 people who have been benefiting from medical fee waivers both before and after the reform (including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above, and holders of Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme Level 0 vouchers), as of January 7, the HA has approved 49 310 medical fee waiver applications. This figure is 3.5 times of approximately 14 000 patients who received medical fee waivers in previous year, demonstrating that the enhanced medical fee reduction mechanism has significantly strengthened support for low-income families and underprivileged groups. Over the past week, many patients have benefited from the enhanced medical fee waivers mechanism, receiving immediate fee reduction when using Accident and Emergency Departments (A&E), outpatient and inpatient services.

Medical fee waivers take effect covering more than 10 000 poor patients

As an essential component of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the HA expanded its medical fee waivers mechanism at the same time, which significantly increased the number of eligible individuals from approximately 300 000 to about 1.4 million - around 4.6 times the previous number of beneficiaries. This ensures that limited medical resources can be more precisely directed to help those most in need: the poor, acute, serious, and critical patients. As of January 7, among the 49 310 medical fee waiver applications approved by the HA, 32 249 cases have completed assessment and received formal waiver certificates valid for up to 18 months but claimed . For patients who claim to meet the medical fee waivers eligibility criteria but are unable to submit supporting documents for financial assessment, the HA has exercised flexible arrangements to approve 17 061 ""conditional waivers"", allowing patients to obtain immediate medical fee reductions when using public healthcare services. These patients must submit relevant documentation within three months.

After the fees and charges reform, many patients are benefited for the first time from the expanded medical fee waivers mechanism, changing from paying full fees to receiving free services. From January 1 to 7, excluding the number of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above, and holders of Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme Level 0 vouchers who can continue to use their medical fee waivers, there are over 11 200 patients benefitted from the enhanced medical fee waivers mechanism, including:


About 500 poor patients at A&Es,who were triaged as urgent, semi-urgent and non-urgent, received medical fee waivers, triple of last year's figure;
About 2 100 poor patients received medical fee waivers for inpatient services, 3.5 times of last year's figure; and
About 8 600 poor patients received medical fee waivers for specialist outpatient services, six times of last year's figure.


The HA spokesperson stated, ""The data concerned shows obviously that the enhanced medical fee waivers mechanism, which is newly introduced in line with the public healthcare fees and charges reform, can allocate resources more precisely to strengthen protection for poor, acute, serious and critical patients, ensuring that no patient is denied from medical care due to lack of means.""

The current situation regarding patients' applications and usage of medical fee waivers aligns with the HA's projection. The HA will continue to strengthen its manpower to provide assistance to patients in need. To ensure the integrity of the medical fee assistance system and prevent abuse, the HA will conduct regular reviews of approved cases.

Number of non-urgent A&E patients reduced significantly while treatment efficiency for emergency patients improved

Regarding A&E services, from January 1 to 7, 32 147 patients attended the 18 A&Es under the HA, significantly decreased by about 11.9 per cent of the same period last year. Among the cases, 1 807 patients were classified as critical and emergency cases, and 14 077 patients were classified as urgent cases, showing a slight increase compared to the same period last year. The remaining 16 263 patients were classified as semi-urgent and non-urgent cases, showing a significant decrease of 17.8 per cent compared to the same period last year. Since the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the operations of public hospital A&E services has initially met expected results, including:


Significant decrease in average daily A&E attendances by about 11.9 per cent;
In the past seven days, about 1 800 critical and emergency patients exempted from A&E fees under the new fees and charges reform. These patients were required to pay the fees before the reform;
For patients classified as urgent cases, the percentage of those being treated within 30 minutes - meeting the service pledge target - increased from 82.7per cent last year to 88.8 per cent, with average waiting time reduced from 22 to 19 minutes; and
Among the five triage categories, semi-urgent and non-urgent patients decreased from 54.2 per cent in the same period last year to 50.6 per cent.


The HA spokesperson said, ""The service data of the past week shows that the fees and charges reform allowed A&Es to perform their emergency care function more effectively. A&Es can better concentrate resources, treat patients with urgent medical needs more effectively, and improve treatment efficiency for urgent cases.""

The HA will continue to closely monitor the fees and charges reform as well as the overall operations of services of public hospitals, in order to ensure achieving the aim of protecting poor, acute, serious or critical patients."

​行政長官在大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會2026致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2026-01-09 19:30,2026-01-09 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900267.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（一月九日）在大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會2026的視像致辭：

各位來自粵港澳大灣區的政商界領袖、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

今天是粵港澳大灣區工商界的年度盛事——大灣區工商界高峰論壇及交流會舉辦的日子。活動今年在廣州南沙舉行，以「凝聚香港國際優勢助力灣區內聯外通」為主題，匯聚粵港澳工商界的代表共商發展。首先，我熱烈祝賀大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會順利舉行。

二十屆四中全會對「十五五」時期國家經濟社會發展作出戰略擘畫，指出要增強區域發展協調性，鞏固提升粵港澳大灣區高質量發展動力源作用。廣州南沙是國家「十四五」規劃下的大灣區重大合作平台，香港是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，正全力建設國際創新科技中心，打造國際高端人才集聚高地。在「十五五」時期，香港將繼續積極通過南沙等合作平台，深度參與粵港澳大灣區建設，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

二○二二年六月，國務院印發《廣州南沙深化面向世界的粵港澳全面合作總體方案》（《南沙方案》），為南沙擘劃重點發展方向。去年，《南沙方案》迎來第一階段發展目標的收官之年，建設成果豐碩。南沙的高新技術企業數量，已超過1 300家，國際高端人才年均增長百分之55。南沙的大灣區合作成效顯著，已有19個粵港澳聯合科技攻關項目加快推進。香港科技大學（廣州）在二○二二年正式開學，更已經有32個創新項目入駐大學的科創成果轉移轉化基地。

環顧全球，世界百年變局加速演進，地緣政治動蕩加劇，國際形勢複雜多變。國家實施高水平雙向對外開放戰略，鼓勵內地企業善用產能，助力不同地區的經濟和社會發展。二○二四年，國家對外直接投資超過1 900億美元，年增長超過百分之8。其中，國家對東盟的投資增長接近四成、對共建「一帶一路」國家投資的增長超過兩成，反映內地企業出海的勢頭正在加速。

內地企業出海的進程中，需要大量資金和專業服務的支持，也需要國際化的商業平台，讓產品及技術與國際接軌，更有效對接海外市場的需求。為更好服務企業出海，我在《施政報告》提出設立一站式平台內地企業出海專班，主動招攬計劃拓展海外業務的企業，通過香港為平台出海。

在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有內聯外通的優勢。香港是國家唯一的普通法司法管轄區，法律制度與全球多個金融中心接軌。同時，香港實行簡單低稅制，擁有高度開放和國際化的營商環境。我們積極推動數字貿易、金融服務、法律服務等領域的創新，為大灣區發展提供多元化、高增值、全方位的專業服務。

我們會繼續發揮香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，為內地企業提供籌融資服務，以至設立國際業務總部、財資中心、科研中心、供應鏈管理中心等，攜手企業一同走向世界。

長風破浪會有時，直掛雲帆濟滄海。工商界是大灣區建設的重要力量，是兩地合作的參與者與受益者。我相信各位會善用今天的活動，繼續深化交流，在科技創新、現代服務等領域，發掘更多合作商機。我期待香港企業充分發揮國際視野與資源網絡，與內地企業共同「走出去」，對接全球市場，為國家高水平對外開放貢獻更大力量。

最後，我祝願在座各位在新一年四季平安、大展鴻圖。謝謝大家。"
公營醫療收費改革　保障貧急重危病人　減免人數已達往年全年3.5倍,2026-01-09 19:23,2026-01-09 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900429.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（一月九日）公布，除改革前後均受惠於醫療費用豁免的60萬人（即綜援受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受助人及長者院舍照顧服務券計劃級別0院舍券持有人）外，截至一月七日，醫管局已批出49 310宗醫療費用減免申請，達往年每年約14 000名病人獲批減免的3.5倍，顯示優化醫療費用減免機制大幅加強支援低收入家庭及弱勢社群。過去一周，不少病人受惠於優化後的減免機制，即時在使用急症室、門診及住院服務時獲得費用減免。

醫療費用減免生效逾萬貧困病人受惠

作為公營醫療收費改革的重要部分，醫管局同時擴大了醫療費用減免機制，令合資格低收入人士由過往約30萬大幅增加至約140萬，是過去受惠人數約4.6倍，確保有限的醫療資源可更精準投放幫助最有需要的貧、急、重、危病人。截至一月七日，醫管局批出的49 310宗減免申請中，包括32 249宗已完成評核及批出減免證明書的個案，最長可獲18個月的正式醫療費用減免；對於聲稱符合減免資格，但未能提交證明文件進行經濟審查的病人，醫管局亦彈性處理批出了17 061宗「有條件減免」申請，以便病人可以即時獲得醫療費用減免，但病人必須在三個月內提交相關文件作審查。

收費改革後，不少病人更首次受惠於擴大醫療費用減免機制，從以往繳付全費改為免費。由一月一日至七日期間，撇除改革前後均受惠於醫療費用減免的人士（即綜援受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受助人及長者院舍照顧服務券計劃級別0院舍券持有人），已經有超過11 200名病人受惠於優化後的減免機制，其中包括︰


約500名獲分流為緊急、次緊急及非緊急的貧困病人獲得急症室費用減免，是去年同期約3倍；
約2 100名貧困病人獲得住院費用減免，是去年同期約3.5倍；及
約8 600名貧困病人獲得專科門診費用減免，是去年同期約6倍。

 
醫管局發言人說︰「有關數據清楚顯示，配合公營醫療收費改革新引入的擴大醫療費用減免機制，能夠更精準有效投放資源，令更多貧、急、重、危病人受保障，確保不會有病人因為經濟原因而未能接受醫療服務。」

現時病人申請及使用醫療費用減免的情況，與醫管局預計的情況相若，醫管局會繼續加強人手為有需要的病人提供協助，為了確保醫療費用援助制度健全及防止被濫用，醫管局會定期隨機抽查已批核的個案。

急症室非緊急病人顯著減少緊急病人治療效率提升

在急症室服務方面，由一月一日至七日，共有32 147名病人前往醫管局轄下18間急症室就診，較去年同期顯著減少11.9%，其中1 807名病人分流類別為危殆及危急、14 077名病人為緊急，較去年同期微升，餘下16 263名病人為次緊急及非緊急，較去年同期大減17.8%。自從公營醫療收費改革實施以來，對公立醫院急症室服務的運作亦初見成效，其中包括︰


急症室每日平均求診人次顯著減少約11.9%；
過去七日，約1 800名分流類別為危殆及危急的病人在新收費機制下獲豁免急症室收費。而在收費改革前，此類病人需要繳費；
分流類別為緊急的病人於30分鐘內就診，達致服務承諾指標的比率由去年82.7%增加至88.8%，而平均等候時間亦由22分鐘縮短至19分鐘；及
五類分流類別中，次緊急及非緊急病人佔比由去年同期54.2%減少至50.6%。


醫管局發言人說︰「過去一星期的服務數據顯示，收費改革令急症室能夠更有效發揮救急扶危的功能。急症室可以更集中資源及更有效治療有緊急醫療需要的病人，緊急病人的治療效率亦得以提升。」

醫管局會繼續密切監察公營醫療收費改革以及醫院服務的整體運作情況，確保達到保障貧、急、重、危病人的宗旨。"
反非法勞工行動拘十六人（附圖）,2026-01-09 18:27,2026-01-09 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900618.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於一月二日至昨日（一月八日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「促進行動」、「曙光行動」以及聯同食物環境衛生署及康樂及文化事務署執行的「驚愕行動」。行動中共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工、三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名涉嫌協助及教唆者。

反非法勞工行動中，入境處調查人員搜查了多個目標地點，包括食肆、貨倉及髮型屋等，共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為四男八女，年齡介乎二十九至七十歲，當中兩名女子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），另有三名女子涉嫌行使及管有他人身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩男一女，年齡介乎三十至六十四歲。此外，被捕的涉嫌協助及教唆者為一名六十二歲女子。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

16 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2026-01-09 18:27,2026-01-09 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900624.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Contribute"", ""Twilight"" and a joint operation with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department codenamed ""Flabbergast"" from January 2 to yesterday (January 8). A total of 12 suspected illegal workers, three suspected employers and a suspected aider and abettor were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations including restaurants, warehouses and hair salons etc. Twelve suspected illegal workers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised four men and eight women, aged 29 to 70. Among them, two women were holding recognizance forms which prohibit them from taking any employment. In addition, three women were suspected of using and being in possession of Hong Kong identity cards which relates to another person. Two men and one woman, aged 30 to 64, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. Furthermore, the suspected aider and abettor arrested was a woman aged 62. An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or a identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

FSD introduces new measures to enhance fire service installations management and information transparency,2026-01-09 18:15,2026-01-09 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900602.htm,"  The Fire Services Department (FSD) yesterday (January 8) issued two circular letters to regulate registered fire service installation contractors (RFSIC) in further enhancing the management of fire service installations and equipment (FSI) and increasing transparency of information related to the operational status of FSIs. With the new measures in place, occupants and property management staff can have a better understanding of the operational status of FSIs. The new regulations have become effective immediately.

  FSD Circular Letter No. 1/2026 stipulates that when there is any defect in FSIs such as hose reels and manual call points, RFSICs must affix a Damage Notice complying with standard requirements in a prominent position on the FSI to facilitate easy identification. Members of the public can therefore avoid using non-operable FSIs during emergencies. In addition, RFSICs are required to apply seals on the main power switches of FSI systems to prevent power from being turned off by mistake, and facilitate inspections by property management staff to identify the status of power supply and take necessary follow-up actions in a timely manner.

  FSD Circular Letter No. 2/2026 reminds RFSICs that before turning off any FSIs for works, pre-assessment should be conducted on whether functions of other FSIs will be affected. All areas being affected should be reported concurrently to the FSD. RFSICs must put up large-sized notices at prominent locations such as main building entrances and lift lobbies, clearly outlining information including dates of FSI operation suspension and areas being affected, to keep occupants, property management staff, and other relevant parties informed. Occupants will therefore be reminded to raise awareness of fire safety when the FSIs are not in working order or being shut down.

  The FSD emphasises that RFSICs must strictly adhere to the new requirements. Any misconduct or negligence may result in disciplinary actions by the FSD, including being removed from the register of RFSICs.

  The FSD has been committed to enhancing building fire safety through regulation, inspection, and public education. It will continue to review and enhance various fire safety measures.

  Details of the two circular letters are available on the FSD's website:

創新科技及工業局常任秘書長在南沙出席「大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會2026」致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-01-09 18:11,2026-01-09 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900634.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局常任秘書長蔡傑銘今日（一月九日）在南沙出席「大灣區（南沙）工商界高峰論壇及交流會2026」的致辭：

岳陽副書記（廣州市南沙區委副書記、區長）、林世豪主席（香港工業總會主席）：

大家好，很榮幸有機會與在座各位工商界翹楚共聚一堂，見證香港及粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）其他城市在多方面的合作，分享香港推進新型工業化的最新進展，並探討如何利用香港優勢進一步加快灣區發展。

「十五五」規劃建議為國家及大灣區未來一段時間的發展指明了方向，進一步明確了香港在新時期的定位和功能，其中重要一點是建設國際創科中心，融入和服務國家發展大局。

當前國際政治經濟發展再次證明了國家倡導科技創新和產業創新、堅持發展製造業及實體經濟決策的前瞻性和正確性。本屆特區政府因地制宜發展新質生產力、推進香港新型工業化。過去三年推出並落實一系列政策措施，完善本地創科生態圈，在支持傳統製造業利用創科升級轉型，促進創科及新型工業化發展方面取得積極的進展。根據政府統計處的數據，二○二四年香港「製造及新型工業產業」的增加價值為822億港元，較前一年上升7%，約佔本地生產總值的2.64%，反映政府的政策措施已漸見成效。

「十五五」規劃建議強調擴大高水平對外開放，開創合作共贏新局面。香港需要發揮高度國際化及內聯外通的優勢，作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，與內地攜手打拼。創新科技及工業局自二○二三年起，已扶植近500家具潛力或引領性的創科企業有意在港發展、落戶或擴展業務，涵蓋生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人，以及先進製造與新能源科技等策略性產業。我們一直鼓勵這些企業與本地企業攜手合作，並善用特區政府不同的支援計劃，在這裏建立研發、中試與生產基地，利用香港製造的品牌優勢，將產品與服務推向全球市場。就此，我們最近已放寬推進創科產業落地發展的100億元「新型工業加速計劃」申請門檻，將項目總成本最低要求由3億港元調低至1.5億港元，以支持更多智能生產設施的建設。

此外，政府推動成立的香港新型工業發展聯盟匯聚資源構建「政、產、學、研、投」合作平台。同時，我們革新投資創科產業的思維，正籌備設立100億港元「創科產業引導基金」並計劃於二○二六至二七年度啓動，加強引導市場資金投資指定策略性新興和未來產業，建立具有香港優勢的創科產業鏈。這些措施都旨在推動香港創科生態圈發展，從而更好地支持包括大灣區在內的不同地區企業實現發展目標。

各位，李強總理於本月初在廣東調研期間表示，邁入新的一年，要緊緊圍繞推動高質量發展這個主題，牢記在全國發展大局中的使命，厚植創新發展優勢，奮力實現「十五五」良好開局。香港特區政府正積極推展各方面工作，包括已於去年十二月就香港新型工業中長期發展展開研究，探討如何主動對接「十五五」，融入國家新型工業化整體布局，在構建現代化產業體系中發揮獨特作用，服務國家高質量發展。

「深圳─香港─廣州」去年榮登全球創新集群之首，這充分説明灣區的巨大潛力和無限前景。新的歷史時期，香港將進一步發揮好「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，以及「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台角色，與灣區各夥伴城市加強創科聯動、優勢互補，共同為實現國家的科技自立自強、引領發展新質生產力、構建高質量科技產業體系貢獻力量。

祝今天的活動圓滿成功，亦祝大家在二○二六年生意一帆風順，國家發展蒸蒸日上。謝謝！"

蚊傳疾病登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況,2026-01-09 17:30,2026-01-09 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900558.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月九日）公布登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區（包括鄰近東南亞國家）的氣溫仍然適合蚊媒滋生，市民前往受蚊傳疾病影響的地區，應採取措施防止被蚊叮咬，包括穿着寬鬆、淺色的長袖上衣及長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。

登革熱
———

​由一月二日至昨日（一月八日），中心錄得兩宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期分別到過菲律賓及越南。

截至昨日，今年錄得兩宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二五年共錄得59宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞二○二四年錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。由二○二五年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點亦普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度和越南去年（二○二五年）已分別錄得超過100 000宗個案，馬來西亞和泰國亦分別錄得超過40 000宗個案，新加坡則錄得超過4 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省二○二五年共錄得超過3 500宗本地感染病例，去年十二月二十二日至二十八日的一周內錄得一宗於汕頭的病例。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

基孔肯雅熱
—————

​截至今日下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2026-01-09 17:30,2026-01-09 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900554.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 9) reported the latest situation of dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF). The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminds the public that temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions (including neighbouring Southeast Asian countries) remain favourable for mosquito breeding. When travelling to areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, the public should take measures to prevent mosquito bites, including wearing loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers and applying insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or exposed parts of the body.

Dengue fever
----------------

  From January 2 to yesterday (January 8), the CHP recorded two imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to the Philippines and Vietnam respectively during the incubation period.

  As of yesterday, two imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 59 imported cases of DF were recorded in 2025.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 100 000 cases in 2025; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 4 000 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded over 3 500 locally infected cases in 2025. One local case was recorded in a week between December 22 and 28, 2025, in Shantou.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

  As of 5pm today, no new cases of CF had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​​​​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

The director pleaded guilty at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts today (January 9) and was fined a total sum of $75,000.
