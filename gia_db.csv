Voters to follow voting procedures in 2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections to be held this Sunday,2025-09-04 16:00,2025-09-04 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400495.htm,"The 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections will be held this Sunday (September 7) and the polling hours are from 9am to 6pm. The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) reminds voters/authorised representatives (ARs) concerned to follow the instructions on their poll card and bring the original of their valid Hong Kong identity (HKID) card to vote at their designated polling station.

 A spokesman for the REO said today (September 4), ""In accordance with the law, only registered voters/ARs in the 2025 final register of voters for Election Committee subsectors who belong to contested subsectors are eligible to vote on the polling day. The six contested subsectors are commercial (third); architectural, surveying, planning and landscape; technology and innovation; labour; representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of Hong Kong and Kowloon; and representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of the New Territories.

""Voters/ARs of the six subsectors may use 'iAM Smart' or the voter registration website (vr.gov.hk) to log in to the Online Voter Information Enquiry System to check polling information such as the name and address of their designated polling station and its location on the map, the polling hours, as well as the Introduction to Candidates. They can also call the election hotline (2891 1001) for enquiries.""

 On the polling day, there will be 28 candidates contesting a total of 21 seats in six subsectors. Five ordinary polling stations located in the Exhibition Gallery of Hong Kong Central Library, Kowloon Park Sports Centre, Wai Tsuen Sports Centre, Tiu Keng Leng Sports Centre and Che Kung Temple Sports Centre, and one dedicated polling station at Happy Valley Police Station will be set up for about 3 600 voters/ARs of the contested subsectors.

Polling arrangements

  A voter or an AR must produce the original of his/her valid HKID card at the ballot paper issuing desk in the polling station. The polling staff will scan the HKID card of the voter or AR using a tablet of the Electronic Poll Register System to verify his/her identity and issue the ballot paper(s) upon verification.

 When marking the ballot paper, voters/ARs must fill in the ovals opposite the names of the candidates of their choice with the black pen provided at the polling station, and vote for no more than the prescribed number of seats in the relevant subsector, otherwise the ballot paper will be regarded as invalid.

 The spokesman said, ""Ballot paper checking machines will be set up at the polling stations for voters/ARs to check whether the ballot paper has been marked according to the electoral law. The ballot paper checking machines will not record or count the choice(s) marked on the ballot paper. Having checked the ballot paper, voters/ARs should insert the unfolded ballot paper into the ballot box with the marked side facing down. It is in principle alright for voters/ARs to bring along a piece of paper listing the names or numbers of the candidates of their choice for easy reference when marking the ballot papers. Nevertheless, voters/ARs should bear in mind that they should not show the paper to other people inside the polling station and they should take the paper with them when leaving the polling station. Otherwise, the voters/ARs concerned may violate the electoral law,"" the spokesman said.

 Based on the principles of the autonomy of voting and secrecy of votes, it is prohibited under the law to have anyone (even for the voter/AR's relative or friend) to accompany or assist the voter to cast his/her vote. If necessary, a voter/an AR may ask the Presiding Officer or his/her deputy to mark the ballot paper on the voter/AR's behalf in the presence of a member of the polling staff as witness. It is an offence for any voter/AR to disturb others, use electronic devices for communication, take photographs, or make a video or audio recording at a polling station.

 The spokesman said that the introduction booklets on candidates printed by the REO will be displayed at all polling stations for reference by voters/ARs.

Special arrangements at polling stations

 Two queues will be set up at the polling stations. One queue is for people aged 70 or above, pregnant women and those who are not able to queue for a long time or have difficulty in queuing due to their physical condition, while the other queue is for other voters/ARs. The Presiding Officers will flexibly deploy ballot paper issuing desks depending on the queuing situation.

 A certain area outside each polling station will be designated as a no canvassing zone to ensure that voters/ARs can gain access to the polling stations without interference. A no staying zone will also be designated outside the entrance and exit of a polling station. No one is allowed to stay in the no staying zone or be allowed to canvass for votes or conduct ""de-facto canvassing"" such as making hand gestures and greetings in the no canvassing zone.

 Enquiries about the By-elections on the polling day can be made to the election hotline at 2891 1001, which will operate from 8.30am to 6.30pm that day. A complaints hotline (2827 7251/3707 0188) will be in service from 9am to 6.30pm that day to handle complaints about breaches of electoral rules or guidelines.

Counting arrangements

 Once the poll is closed, the ballot boxes will be delivered to the Central Counting Station at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre for counting. Candidates, election agents and counting agents may enter the Central Counting Station and observe the count at designated areas of the counting zone. Members of the public and media may also enter the public area of the Central Counting Station to observe the count. A notice setting out the maximum capacity of members of the public in the public area will be displayed outside the Central Counting Station.

 Once the counting of votes is completed, the Returning Officers will declare the election results at the Central Counting Station. The REO will also arrange for the Returning Officers to announce again the election results of each subsector on the stage of the Media Centre. The election results will also be displayed outside the Central Counting Station and published via press releases and the election website (www.elections.gov.hk).

 For enquiries, please call the election hotline on 2891 1001 or visit the election website for more information on the By-elections."

  盧寵茂教授早上與國家中醫藥管理局局長余艷紅教授會面時，向她介紹香港中醫藥發展的最新情況，以及將於今年底公布的《中醫藥發展藍圖》的制訂工作。他說︰「香港特別行政區（特區）政府十分重視中醫藥全方位、高質量及高水平發展，近年持續加大力度並投放更多資源，積極推展和落實各項工作。香港中醫醫院和政府中藥檢測中心永久大樓兩個中醫藥發展旗艦機構於今年十二月起分階段投入服務後，將有助香港在中醫藥臨床服務、人才培訓和檢測標準等領域進一步發展。」

  他又提及特區政府將於十二月承辦「第七屆粵港澳大灣區中醫藥傳承創新發展大會」，屆時來自大灣區三地九市代表及國內外中醫藥權威專家學者將匯聚香港作交流，並共同見證多項香港中醫藥發展的重要里程碑。

  隨後，盧寵茂教授與衞健委副主任曹雪濤院士會面，提到近年香港公立醫院積極採納各項國家醫療標準進行認證。盧寵茂教授說︰「特區醫療機構採納國家醫療標準進行認證，除了能提升自身的醫療專業水平與服務質量外，亦有助與國家醫療衞生服務體系接軌，並且充分發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，向國際社會展示國家醫療標準的卓越性，助力國家醫療標準走向國際。」

  繼東區尤德夫人那打素醫院和威爾斯親王醫院兩家公立醫院成功通過《國際醫院評審認證標準（中國）》（2021版）評審認證，特區政府正推動醫院管理局（醫管局）轄下更多公立醫院採納該標準進行認證。此外，醫管局亦根據行政長官《施政報告》提出的相關政策，按國家認證標準於合適的公立醫院建設胸痛中心和中風中心。其中，瑪麗醫院的胸痛中心已於今年五月成功通過相關評審，成為香港首間獲國家認證的胸痛中心。」

  會上，盧寵茂教授亦談及與內地在癌症領域的合作。他說︰「國家癌症中心在癌症防治領域擁有豐富經驗，雙方會繼續秉持『資源聯動、技術同質、人才共用、合作共赢』的理念，並堅持『優勢互補、互利共贏』的原則，深化和拓展戰略協作，不斷提升癌症防治的專業水準，增進人民健康福祉。」

  下午，盧寵茂教授與藥監局局長李利會面時，向他介紹香港發展成為國際醫療創新樞紐的多項重要措施。盧寵茂教授表示︰「特區政府正積極籌備於明年成立香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心（藥械監管中心），並於明年分階段落實『第一層審批』新藥註冊機制。藥械監管中心的成立將大力推動香港的醫療創新，並助力國內創新藥械走向國際，惠及香港及其他地區的人民。」

  「同時，香港特區政府積極響應國家戰略與政策指引，成立粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所，並正籌建真實世界研究及應用中心。特區政府期望透過粵港澳大灣區城市合作，共同將大灣區打造成為國家乃至全球領先的醫療創新高地，大力發展新質生產力，推動臨床試驗及生物醫藥產業發展，以香港所長，貢獻國家所需。」

Secretary for Health leads delegation to Beijing (with photos),2025-09-04 15:50,2025-09-04 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400243.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, led a delegation to call on the National Health Commission (NHC), the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) and the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in Beijing today (September 4) to introduce the latest developments in various healthcare policies in Hong Kong.

  During the meeting with the Commissioner of the NATCM, Professor Yu Yanhong, this morning, Professor Lo introduced her to the latest Chinese medicine (CM) developments in Hong Kong and the formulation of the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint, which will be released at the end of this year. He said, ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government attaches great importance to the high-quality and high-standard development of CM on all fronts, and has continued to step up its efforts and devote more resources in recent years to pursue and implement various initiatives. The two flagship institutions for CM development, namely The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong and the permanent premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute, with services to be commenced in phases from December this year, will be conducive to Hong Kong's further development in areas such as CM clinical services, talent training, and testing standards.""

  He also mentioned that the HKSAR Government will host the 7th Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) Conference on Inheritance, Innovation and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine in December. Representatives from the two special administrative regions and nine municipalities of the Guangdong Province of the GBA, as well as authoritative Mainland and overseas CM experts and scholars, will gather in Hong Kong for exchanges and to jointly witness various significant milestones in CM development in Hong Kong.

  Professor Lo then met with Vice-Minister of the NHC Professor Cao Xuetao, and mentioned that public hospitals in Hong Kong have been adopting various national healthcare standards for accreditation in recent years. Professor Lo said, ""By adopting national healthcare standards for accreditation, healthcare institutions in the HKSAR not only can enhance their healthcare professional standards and service quality but also facilitate their alignment with the national healthcare service system. This can also demonstrate the excellence of the national healthcare standards to the international community through fully leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantages of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, thereby facilitating the national standards to go global.""

  Following the successful accreditation of two public hospitals, namely Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital, under China's International Hospital Accreditation Standards (2021 Version), the HKSAR Government is promoting the adoption of the Standards for accreditation in more public hospitals under the Hospital Authority (HA). Furthermore, in line with the relevant policy initiatives set out in the Chief Executive's Policy Address, the HA is establishing chest pain centres and stroke centres in accordance with national accreditation standards at suitable public hospitals. Of these, the chest pain centre at Queen Mary Hospital was successfully accredited in May this year, becoming the first nationally accredited chest pain centre in Hong Kong.

  During the meeting, Professor Lo also touched upon co-operation with the Mainland in the field of cancer. He said, ""The National Cancer Center has extensive experience in cancer prevention and treatment. Both sides will continue to strive for the goals of 'equally high-calibre technology with the available resources, pooling our talent to strike win-win co-operation', and uphold the principle of 'complementarity and mutual benefits', while deepening and expanding the strategic collaboration to continuously improve the professional standard in cancer prevention and treatment, thereby improving the health and well-being of the people.""

  In the afternoon, Professor Lo met with the Commissioner of the NMPA, Mr Li Li, to introduce various key initiatives for developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. Professor Lo said, ""The HKSAR Government is actively preparing for the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) next year, and will implement the 'primary evaluation' for new drugs registration in phases starting next year. The establishment of the CMPR will considerably enhance Hong Kong's health and medical innovation, and facilitate the Mainland's innovative drugs and medical devices to go global, benefitting the people of Hong Kong and other regions.

  ""At the same time, the HKSAR Government has established the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute and is preparing to establish the Real-World Study and Application Centre in response to the national strategies and policy guidance. The HKSAR Government aspires to collaborate with the GBA cities to jointly establish the GBA as a leading hub for health and medical innovation at both national and global levels, while sparing no effort in developing new quality productive forces, and promoting the development of clinical trials and the biomedical industry, thereby serving the country's needs with Hong Kong's own strengths.""

  Members of the delegation include the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam; Deputy Secretary for Health Mr Eddie Lee; and the Chief Executive of the HA, Dr Libby Lee. Professor Lo will return to Hong Kong tonight. During his absence, the Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, is the Acting Secretary for Health."

證監會與金管局的聯合調查顯示二○二四年投資產品銷售及市場參與度均創新高,2025-09-04 12:05,2025-09-04 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090300528.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）與香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（九月四日）發表有關非交易所買賣投資產品分銷情況的年度聯合調查結果，當中顯示二○二四年該等產品的銷售及市場參與度皆創新高（註一）。

在二○二四年，持牌法團和註冊機構的非交易所買賣投資產品的總交易額按年飆升40%至破紀錄的60,730億元（註二）。市場參與度於去年亦錄得廣泛增長。從事投資產品銷售的公司數目上升9%至414家的新高，當中多達46%的公司的銷售錄得一倍以上的按年增幅。大型公司數目上升12%至101家（註三）。此外，負責分銷投資產品的人員增加4%至超過19 000名，而完成至少一項交易的客戶則增加28%至超過120萬名，數目均創下歷史新高（註四）。

在二○二四年，所有主要投資產品種類均錄得顯著的銷售增長。認可集體投資計劃的銷售上升96%至14,000億元，而非認可集體投資計劃則增長50%至8,440億元。結構性產品及債務證券的銷售分別按年上升30%及29%。受訪公司普遍觀察到投資者情緒較一年前高漲，積極追求符合其風險胃納及投資目標的產品。

股票掛鈎產品在強勁的市場動力下蓬勃發展，並依然是最暢銷的結構性產品種類，其銷售達17,290億元，按年增長43%。同時，貨幣市場基金及主權債券被認為風險較低且在二○二四年當時的高息環境下提供可觀回報，因此對投資者仍有吸引力。調查顯示，貨幣市場基金的銷售有所增長，佔大型公司呈報的首五大集體投資計劃總交易額的比例由二○二三年的76%升至80%。主權債券亦受到歡迎，佔去年所銷售債務證券總交易額的49%，而前年則為44%。

證監會中介機構部執行董事葉志衡博士表示：「產品銷售顯著上升，突顯了這些公司對本港金融市場的投入及投資者對市場的信任。證監會堅定不移地建立穩健的監管框架，讓企業能夠發展，同時保障投資者利益。」

金管局助理總裁（銀行操守）區毓麟表示：「投資交易的強勁增長，反映投資者對香港投資市場活力的信心及興趣，並支持市場生態持續增長和發展。調查結果有助監管機構因應市場發展更有效地協調和落實監管工作，從而保障投資者。」

從是次調查觀察到的其他要點包括：


在二○二四年，結構性產品依然是受訪公司銷售最多的產品種類，佔總交易額的42%（25,670億元）。集體投資計劃及債務證券亦位列三甲，分別佔37%（22,440億元）及15%（9,410億元）。




股票掛鈎產品佔二○二四年銷售的全部結構性產品的67%，高於二○二三年的61%。在大型公司呈報的首五大產品中，相關股票以科技（42%）、汽車（23%）及互聯網（22%）行業為主。




網上銷售佔所有受訪公司呈報的總交易額的17%（二○二三年：12%）。在二○二四年，於網上分銷投資產品的受訪公司數目持續增長13%至104家。集體投資計劃仍然是網上平台上銷售最多的產品種類，佔網上銷售總額的77%，其次是佔21%的債務證券。


註一：證監會與金管局向就第1類（證券交易）及／或第4類（就證券提供意見）受規管活動獲發牌或註冊的公司（包括2 368家持牌法團及109家註冊機構）發出年度調查問卷，並獲得超過99%公司的回覆。是次調查涵蓋受訪公司在二○二四年一月一日至十二月三十一日期間（匯報期）向非專業投資者客戶、個人專業投資者及部分法團專業投資者銷售非交易所買賣投資產品的情況。證監會與金管局於二○二一年發表首份聯合調查。

註二：交易額是指投資者就投資產品已付或應付的金額。就結構性產品及衍生工具產品而言，交易額是指在銷售時合約所承擔最高風險的金額。受
訪公司只需匯報單邊交易，而滾轉、贖回及平倉的交易額則無需匯報。

註三：大型公司是指在匯報期內總交易額分別達10億元或以上及300億元或以上的持牌法團及註冊機構。它們需提供所銷售的投資產品的詳情，包括按投資者類型劃分的交易額，及就交易額而言，首五大投資產品的詳情。

註四：在匯報期內完成至少一項非交易所買賣投資產品交易的持牌法團及註冊機構客戶數目分別為493 829名及714 926名。"
SFC-HKMA joint survey shows record investment product sales and market participation in 2024,2025-09-04 12:05,2025-09-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090300533.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today(September 4) published the findings of their annual joint survey on the distribution of non-exchange-traded investment products, showing record sales and level of market participation for these products during 2024 (Note 1).

Total transaction amount of non-exchange-traded investment products by licensed corporations (LCs) and registered institutions (RIs) surged 40per cent year-on-year to a record $6,073 billion in 2024 (Note 2). Market participation also witnessed broad-based growth last year. The number of firms engaged in the sale of investment products grew by 9per cent to a new high of 414, with an overwhelming 46per cent more than doubling their sales year-on-year. The number of large firms saw a 12per cent increase to 101 (Note 3). Also setting new record highs are the manpower deployed to distribute investment products, which rose by 4per cent to more than 19 000, and the number of clients completing at least one transaction, which increased by 28per cent to over 1.2 million (Note 4).

All major investment product types recorded significant sales growth in 2024. Sales of authorised collective investment schemes (CIS) grew 96per cent to $1,400 billion and unauthorised CIS grew 50per cent to $844 billion. Sales of structured products and debt securities increased by 30per cent and 29per cent year-on-year, respectively. Respondent firms generally observed stronger investor sentiment compared with the previous year as investors actively pursued products that suit their risk appetites and investment goals.

Equity-linked products thrived amidst strong market momentum and remained the top-selling structured product category with sales of $1,729 billion, up 43per cent year-on-year. Meanwhile, money market funds and sovereign bonds remained attractive to investors due to their perceived lower risks and decent returns under the prevailing high interest rate environment in 2024. The survey showed an increase in the sales of money market funds, which accounted for 80per cent of the total transaction amount of the top five CIS reported by the large firms, up from 76per cent in 2023. Sovereign bonds also gained popularity, making up 49per cent of total debt securities sold last year, compared with 44per cent in the year before.

""The remarkable surge in product sales underscores the dedication of firms and the trust investors place in our financial markets,"" said the Executive Director of Intermediaries of the SFC, Dr Eric Yip. ""The SFC is steadfast in fostering a robust regulatory framework that enables businesses to grow while protecting investor interests.""

  ""The strong growth in investment transactions reflects heightened investor confidence and interest in the vibrancy of Hong Kong's investment market, and supports the continuous growth and development of the ecosystem,"" said the Executive Director (Banking Conduct) of the HKMA, Mr Alan Au. ""The survey result enables regulators to better co-ordinate and implement our supervisory activities in light of market developments, thus according protection to investors.""

Other major observations from the survey included:


Structured products remained the top product type sold by the respondent firms, accounting for 42per cent ($2,567 billion) of the total transaction amount in 2024. CIS and debt securities rounded out the top three spots, making up 37per cent ($2,244 billion) and 15per cent ($941 billion) respectively.
Equity-linked products made up 67per cent of all structured products sold in 2024, up from 61per cent in 2023. The major underlying equities of the top five products reported by the large firms were from the technology (42per cent), automotive (23per cent) and internet (22per cent) sectors.
Online sales accounted for 17per cent (2023: 12per cent) of the aggregate transaction amount reported by all respondent firms. The number of respondent firms that distributed investment products online continued to grow in 2024, increasing 13per cent to 104. CIS remained the top product type sold through online platforms, making up 77per cent of the total online sales, followed by debt securities at 21per cent.


Note 1: The annual survey questionnaires were sent to 2 368 LCs and 109 RIs licensed or registered for Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities) or both regulated activities, and more than 99per cent of them responded. The survey covered the sale of non-exchange-traded investment products from January 1 to December 31, 2024 (the reporting period) by respondent firms to non-professional investor clients, individual professional investors (PIs) and certain corporate PIs. The first SFC-HKMA joint survey was published in 2021.

Note 2:Transaction amount refers to the amount paid or payable by investors for investment products. For structured products and derivative products, the transaction amount refers to the maximum exposure of the contracts at the point of sale. Respondent firms were requested to report only one side of the transaction. Rollovers, redemptions and position close-outs were not included.

Note 3:Large firms refer to LCs and RIs with total transactions of $1 billion or more and $30 billion or more respectively during the reporting period. They were requested to provide details about the investment products sold, including the transaction amount by investor type and the details of the top five products ranked by transaction amount.

Note 4:The numbers of clients of LCs and RIs who completed at least one transaction in non-exchange-traded investment products during the reporting period were 493 829 and 714 926 respectively."

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-09-04 12:00,2025-09-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400356.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference.

DH cracks down on unlicensed medicine shops illegally selling controlled medicines (with photos),2025-09-04 11:00,2025-09-04 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090300751.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) yesterday (September 3) conducted a joint operation with the Police in Sham Shui Po District to crack down on unlicensed medicine shops illegally selling controlled medicines. During the operation, controlled drugs were seized and two people were arrested.

The DH received intelligence indicating that two unlicensed medicine shops located in Pak Tin were suspected of illegally selling or possessing controlled medicines. The DH, in collaboration with the Police, took enforcement action at the two premises concerned. During the operation, 125 types of controlled drugs were discovered on the premises. A 39-year-old woman and a 36-year-old man present at the scene were arrested on suspicion of illegally selling Part 2 poisons and illegally possessing Part 1 poisons and antibiotics respectively.

  A preliminary investigation indicated that the products seized during the operation included substances classified as Part 1 poisons or Part 2 poisons under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138) (PPO), and antibiotic substances under the Antibiotics Ordinance (Cap. 137) (AO). Some of the products also did not bear Hong Kong registration numbers for pharmaceutical products as required by law and were labelled only in foreign languages (including Japanese and English).

The DH will continue to follow up and investigate the incident.

According to the PPO, all pharmaceutical products must be registered with the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong before they can be legally sold in the market. Additionally, only persons authorised by the Board as Authorized Sellers of Poisons (ASPs) are allowed to conduct the relevant retail business of selling poisons listed in Part 1 and Part 2 of the Poisons List at Schedule 10 of the Pharmacy and Poisons Regulations (Cap. 138A) at premises registered by the Board, whereas Listed Sellers of Poisons can only conduct the retail business of selling poisons listed in Part 2 of the Poisons List. Illegal sale or possession of unregistered pharmaceutical products or Part 1 poisons and illegal sale of Part 2 poisons are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for each offence is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. Moreover, according to the AO, ASPs can only sell antibiotics with the authority of a doctor's prescription. The maximum penalty for illegal sale or possession of antibiotics is a fine of $50,000 and 12 months' imprisonment.

The DH strongly urges members of the public not to buy or use unregistered pharmaceutical products as their safety, efficacy and quality are not guaranteed. All registered pharmaceutical products should carry a Hong Kong registration number on the package in the format of ""HK-XXXXX"". Members of the public should not self-medicate without advice from healthcare professionals. They should stop using them and consult healthcare professionals if they are in doubt or feeling unwell after use. They may visit the website of the Drug Office of the DH for ""General Knowledge on the Use of Medicines"" for information."

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-04 06:46,2025-09-04 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090300834.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 4) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

海關人員四月十日在沙頭角中英街檢查站截查一名以單車運送一批貨物的四十八歲本地男子。經檢查後，海關人員在貨物中的八個紙箱內及在該男子身上的肩背包中檢獲共三萬七千二百三十七支未完稅香煙，他隨即被捕。該批未完稅香煙市值約十八萬六千元，應課稅值約十二萬三千元。他今日被判處監禁四個月。

另外，海關人員昨日（九月二日）在羅湖管制站截查一名六十二歲抵港男旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲共二千二百二十七支未完稅香煙，估計市值約九千一百元，應課稅值約七千四百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日被判處監禁六星期。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，反映不論是否屬於初犯，亦可能被判處監禁。監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民切勿以身試法。根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

  Customs officers intercepted a 48-year-old local man, who was carrying a batch of goods on a bike, for inspection at the Chung Ying Street Checkpoint in Sha Tau Kok on April 10. Upon inspection, a total of 37 237 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from eight carton boxes of the consignment and a shoulder bag carried by the man. The man was subsequently arrested. The estimated market value of the duty-not-paid cigarettes was about $186,000 and the duty potential was about $123,000. He was sentenced to four months' imprisonment today.

  In addition, Customs officers intercepted an incoming 62-year-old male passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (September 2) and seized 2 227 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $9,100 and a duty potential of about $7,400 from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment today.

  Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds members of the public not to defy the law. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

  Under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years. 

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-03 18:20,2025-09-03 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/03/P2025090300604.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 3), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 225 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 24 to 30), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 830 cases (August 10 to 16) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad. The CHP also urged schools to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. They should also remind staff members and students to enact mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html).

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that they must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-03 18:20,2025-09-03 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/03/P2025090300602.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月三日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月二十四日至三十日）廣東省新增225宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別為830宗（八月十日至十六日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的新增病例數字過去一個月持續遞減，但現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。中心亦呼籲學校按照食物環境衞生署（食環署）的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，務必提醒教職員及學生，應時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。」

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食環署繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成10種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

The Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence (MWRCD) organised activities, including a sharing session on the War of Resistance and film screenings, to commemorate the 80th Anniversary of the Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, aiming to deepen the knowledge of the public and students about the War of Resistance.

The museum invited the Deputy President of the Society of Veterans of the Original Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column, Mr Lam Ming, to host a sharing session with local secondary students. He shared the wartime stories of his father's generation. Mr Lam's father joined the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column at the age of 16, and together with Mr Lam's grand uncle, a maritime communication line was established from the Shek Shui Kan Radio Station at Wu Kau Tang to the Battalion Headquarters in Chek Keng, Sai Kung. Mr Lam hopes that the public will commemorate the sacrifices and contributions of the martyrs of the War of Resistance. Secondary students who participated in the sharing session said that they will remember the history of the War of Resistance and cherish the hard-earned peace.

There was also a collaborative art creation activity, inviting members of the public to write greeting cards to express their feelings about the War of Resistance as well as respect for the martyrs and veterans.

In collaboration with the Hong Kong Film Archive, the MWRCD also arranged two screenings of the anti-war movie ""Life Goes On"" (2024) today, which received overwhelming feedback. The film recounts the story of a group of university teachers and students in southern China who endured great hardships during the war, relocating to northern Guangdong and persevering in their educational pursuits despite adverse circumstances.

The ""Standing Together for Peacebuilding: Commemorating the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance in Guangdong and Hong Kong"" exhibition, jointly organised by the MWRCD and the Guangdong Museum of Revolutionary History, is currently on display. Featuring some 40 items/sets of wartime relics and around 150 historical photos, the exhibition shows the history of the people of Guangdong and Hong Kong, led by the Chinese Communist Party, and how they were closely united in resisting the enemy. The exhibition will run until July 8 next year, with free admission. The museum also launches a series of free programmes, including lectures, workshops, film screenings, field visits, and travelling exhibitions.

"Commemorating martyrs in resistance against Japanese aggression through archives: ""Unyielding Land, Eternal Heroes"" exhibition revisits Hong Kong's three years and eight months of Japanese occupation (with photos)",2025-09-03 17:15,2025-09-03 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/03/P2025090300271.htm,"  âToday (September 3) marks the Victory Day of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. On this 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance, the Public Records Office (PRO) of the Government Records Service (GRS) has specially curated its annual thematic exhibition, this one entitled ""Unyielding Land, Eternal Heroes: 80th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance"", featuring precious archives and documented heritage for members of the public to revisit Hong Kong's painful period during the Japanese occupation (1941-1945) and understand the heroic resistance of the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column against the enemy.

  On December 25, 1941, Hong Kong entered three years and eight months of Japanese occupation, during which residents suffered from the invasion, severe food shortages and various hardships. During the early stages of the Japanese occupation, the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column broke through enemy defence lines, successfully rescuing groups of prominent figures in various sectors. Throughout the Japanese occupation, they braved life-and-death danger to engage in combat with the Japanese army, penetrating deep into enemy territories and waters to restrain and attack enemy forces.

  This exhibition showcases over 120 selected items, including photographs documenting the daily marches of the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column and paintings depicting their heroic victories against the enemy, a name list of the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column who died in the defence of Hong Kong, the ""Register of Enemy Properties"" documenting property confiscated by the Japanese Military Government, etc. Additionally, the items reveal stories including the then Hong Kong Government pursuing after the war the recovery of books from the libraries of the University of Hong Kong looted by the Japanese forces, the demolition of the Japanese War Memorial, etc. The precious documented heritage bears witness to the harsh lives of Hong Kong residents during the Japanese occupation and the fearless spirit of the anti-Japanese heroes.

  The thematic exhibition is open from today onwards from Monday to Friday, 9am to 5.45pm (except public holidays), at the Exhibition Hall on the second floor of the Hong Kong Public Records Building at 13 Tsui Ping Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon. Admission is free. In addition to distinctive photo spots, visitors can also experience the weight of the daily rice ration of ""6.4 taels"" during the Japanese occupation, understanding the hardships of people's lives at that time.

To provide members of the public with a better understanding of this history, the PRO has developed a thematic online exhibition (www.grs.gov.hk/ws/online/80VWR/en/home/index.html). Its Facebook page (www.facebook.com/grs.publicrecordsoffice) will regularly share selected exhibition content and historical stories.

The PRO will also organise roving exhibitions of this thematic exhibition in various districts of Hong Kong. Details will be announced on the GRS website (www.grs.gov.hk) and the PRO Facebook page later. For enquiries, please contact the PRO at 2195 7700 or email to proinfo@grs.gov.hk."
