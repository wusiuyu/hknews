The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, spoke at the opening ceremony of the course today. He expressed his gratitude to the Bureau of Policies, Laws and Regulations of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council for their support and trust in the Academy. He said that with the high-quality development of the national economy, an increasing number of outstanding Mainland enterprises are actively expanding to overseas markets, while at the same time facing many challenges. Hong Kong has always been a springboard for Mainland enterprises to go global, and is the only common law jurisdiction in the country with both Chinese and English as official languages under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, making Hong Kong an important hub linking the Mainland and the rest of the world. He said he hopes that the training course will enable participants to comprehensively understand current trends in overseas expansion, keep abreast of evolving legal and regulatory challenges, and effectively tackle the complex issues encountered by enterprises when ""going overseas"".

Participants in this course, including over 30 legal advisors and related professionals from state-owned enterprises, will explore the practical and imminent legal issues and challenges faced by Chinese enterprises going global. Speakers of the lectures include experienced legal professionals from Hong Kong and overseas, as well as members of the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Expert Committee. The Academy also invited more than 10 senior legal practitioners from 12 jurisdictions in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa, to share their first-hand experiences and insights in the local markets with participants in three sessions.

The Academy will continue to leverage the unique advantages of ""one country, two systems"" and the Hong Kong common law system, and organise different courses to promote Hong Kong's legal services in assisting Mainland enterprises in going global."

以下是立法會內務委員會主席李慧琼和副主席陳健波今日（十月二十日）於內務委員會年結記者會上的開場發言全文︰

內務委員會主席︰今日我們會向各位匯‍報內務委員會在今個會‍期的‍工‍作。我會首先請內務委員會副主席陳‍健‍波報告有關審議法案和附屬法例，以及研‍究‍政‍策事‍宜的工‍作。

內務委員會副主席︰在今個會期，內務委員會一‍共‍舉行了31次會‍議。

法案

政府在今個會期總共提交了31‍項法案，當中27‍項包括在政府向立法會提‍交的立法議程內，另外有四項則不在立法議程內。此外，內會亦審議了兩項由議員提交的法案。除‍了《同性伴侶關係登‍記條例草‍案》二‍讀被‍否決外，其餘30項政府法案及兩項議員法案已‍獲立‍法‍會通過；加上11項在上‍年度提交的政‍府法案，今‍年共有43項法案獲得立法會通過。

就議員審議法案的工作方面，內務委員會在今‍個會期一共成‍立了27個法案委‍員‍會，審議了26項政‍府法案及一項議員法案。經法案委員會審議的政府法‍案當中，包括由本人擔任主席，旨在加強打擊濫‍用公‍屋的《2025年房屋（修訂）條例草案》和剛於上‍星期的立法會通過、有關規管網約車的《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》。兩項法案都是以市民的利益為出發點，分別更好地回應市民對善用公營房屋資源的訴求，以及從速解決多年來網‍約‍車缺乏規管的問題，令香港在提供個人化點對點交通服務能夠與時並進。

附屬法例

內務委員會在今個會期考慮了200項附屬法‍例，並成立了總共11個小組委員會，而且詳細研究其‍中27‍項附屬法例，當中包‍括有關推行無紙證券市‍場制‍度、實施註冊消防工程師計劃，以及強制的士安裝行車記錄系統和規定的士司機須容許透過電子繳費媒‍介繳付的士車費。

特‍別值得一提的是，內務委員會成立了小組委‍員會詳細研究兩‍項根據《維‍護國家安全條例》制訂涉及國安公署的附屬法例，使駐港國安公署的角色和行使權力的規範更清晰明確。由於國家安全風險可能突如其‍來，香港特區有憲制責任盡早完成有關《維護國家安全條例》附屬法例的立法工作，進一步完善維護國家安‍全的法律制度和執行機制。內務委員會支持政府「早一日、得一日」推進立法工作的目標，該兩項附‍屬法例於今年五月十四日提交立法會省覽後，隨即於第二天，即五月十五日，召開特別會議，並決定成立小‍組‍委‍員會審議有關附屬法例。鑑於該兩項附屬法例是根‍據《維護國家安全條例》制訂，為確保審議工作的連貫性，內務委員會同意由去年負責審議《維護國‍家安全條例草案》的法案委員會原班委員，擔任附‍屬‍法‍例小組委員會的主席、副主席及委員。小組委‍員會亦立即於同日召開了三次會議，深入而全面地審議該兩項附屬法例，並第一時間在五月十六日的內務委員會上作出口頭報告，總結其審議工作。

研究政策事宜的小組委員會

今年有10個研究政策事宜小組委員會完成工‍作，當中有七個屬於內務委員會轄下，另外三個則在事務委員會轄下成‍立。這些小組委員會分別研究涉‍及人‍口政‍策、金融科技、智慧城市、支援殘疾人‍士和人‍力資源規劃，以及國際教育樞紐建設等多個政‍策範疇的事宜，並就各項觀察所得提出多項甚具參‍考價值的建議。各個小組委‍員‍會的工‍作報告已送交政務司司長及相關政策局考慮，當中不‍少建‍議亦已獲‍得當局採納。

最後，我想特別感謝主席李慧琼議員。在過去兩年，我們齊心協力，一同盡心做好內務委員會的每‍項工作。對於能夠以內務委員會副主席的身分，為‍議會高質素、高效運作，付出一分力，我深感光榮。

內務委員會主席︰

議事工作

本屆立法會是香港特區完善選舉制度和「愛國者治港」原則全面落實後產生的首屆立‍法‍會。這四年以來，在協助政府實現良政善治、開啟「由治及興」新局面的道路上，任重而道遠。作‍為特區管治團‍隊的重要組成部分，立法機關在今個會期繼續和行‍政機關良性互動，助力政府深‍化改革、加快社會經濟發展，以民生福祉為依‍歸。這特別體現在本屆立法會高質、高效審議法案的工作上。正如剛才副主席提到，立法會在本‍年‍度通過了41項政府法‍案，成績亮麗。特別感‍謝政務司司長，積極跟進我和副主席對法案提‍交立法會的時間表和審議進度提出的關注，結果大部分政府法案在今年四月底前已提交立‍法會，讓議員有較為充分的時‍間了解法案內容，並且進行仔細審議。

在法案委員會審議階段，各‍政‍策局亦積極配合法案委員會的工作，包括盡快就委員會提出的事項作出回應，令審議工作提速提效。議員亦切實履行憲制角色，仔細地審議草案文本，並從自身專業、廣大市民和整體社會發展的角度，在‍政策、條文和執行層面上提出多項有深度、有‍力‍度、有角度、有温度的寶貴意見，務求使法案達至完善的位置。

在‍議員和政府的共同努力下，這41項獲通過的政府法‍案當中，35項法案，即百分之八十五，在‍今‍年‍七月底前已獲通過。所通過的法案涵蓋不‍同政策範疇，既有提升民生福祉，亦‍有‍對社會及經濟發展非常關鍵的政策。我特別想指出，當中有為解決劣質「劏房」這個老大難問‍題，引入簡樸房規管制度；在新土地以業權註冊制度，取代已實行超過百年的契約註冊制度；就‍穩‍定幣發行人設立發牌制度，進一步鞏固香港國際金融中心地位；加強打擊濫用公屋，確保公‍營房屋資源得以善用；為引入合資格非本地培‍訓輔助醫‍療專業人‍員提供新途徑；以及引入規‍管網約車服務的法‍律框‍架，為個人化點對點交‍通服務締造良性及可持續發展的競爭環境等。

本年度是本屆立法會最後一個會期。回顧第‍七屆立法會四年會期，一共通過了130項法案，比第六屆立法會同期通過（法案）的數‍目，多‍出了49‍項，即百分之六十，展現出在行政主‍導體‍制下，立法會以善作善成之志，做實事、做成事的果‍效。我亦特別想提到，在本屆立法會，政府接受議員意見，將其轉化為修正案（的比例），總計有近百分之五十，是歷屆之冠。

議事程序

按照一貫做法，每屆立法會任期結束前，議‍員都會總結經‍驗，檢討和優化議會運作。在‍今‍個會期，內務委員會通過了由議‍事規則委‍員‍會提交優化議會運作的一籃子建議，當中重‍中之重，是‍有關完善立法會議員履職制度，制定《立法會議‍員守則》。其他建議包括優化政策事宜小組委員會的運作、優化委‍員會職‍務‍訪‍問的安排等。各項建議將‍會在第‍八‍屆立‍法‍會任期開‍始時實施，讓新一屆議員投‍入工作時有規可循，同‍時提‍升議會運作的透明度和效率，讓市‍民更‍深‍入了解和監察立‍法‍會議員的工‍作。這些成果展‍現出立‍法會自我完善、精‍益求精的擔當，為‍下‍一‍屆立‍法會繼續貫徹「愛‍國‍者治港」原則、更‍好發揮立‍法會憲制職能提供了良好的基礎。

行政立法關係

行政與立法機關積極互動，對促進良政善‍治是不可或缺。政府和立法會在今個會期繼‍續透過「行政長官互‍動交流答問會」和「立法會前廳交流會」進行全方位的交流和協作。前‍廳‍交‍流‍會在今個會期共舉行了四次，並注入了以‍事‍務‍委‍員‍會為基礎的新元素，務求令交流會發‍揮更大效用。議員與官員在交流會中就各項宏‍觀及微觀議題交換意見，進一步加強行政立法良性互‍動，令政府施政更貼地。本年度會期議‍員亦與行政長官舉行了一共兩次答問會及互動交流答問會，彼此就深化國際交往合作、加快發展北部都會區等議題互相交換意見、表達意見，推動香港主動對接國家發展戰略，積極融入國家發展大局。

本會期內，在內務委員會轄下的各個政策事‍宜小組委員會完成工作向內會作出報告後，我‍將相關報告轉交政務司司長，供其納入施政考‍量。除此之外，我亦特別安排了小組委員‍會與相關政策局舉行跟進會議，讓各小組委員會的主‍席及副主席，能夠與政策局局長聚焦交流報告中的重點建議，涉及的政策範疇包括金融科技、第二核心商業區發展、人口政策、工務工程效益、支援殘疾人士等。特別感謝行政長官、司長和各政策局局長高度重視議員的建議，在《施政報告》中採納‍了不少我們的意見，攜手推動香港邁向更高質量發展，全‍力改善民生，發展經濟。

此外，在內務委員會同意下，保安事務委員會聯同保安局前往廣州進行職務考察，了解當地在提升防罪工作和執法效率，以及提供便民服務方‍面的工作。公務員及資助機構員工事務委員會則聯同公務員事務局和數字政策辦公室前往深圳進行職務考察，了解深圳市政府應用人工智能輔‍助公職人員處理政務的情況。代表團向內‍務委‍員會委員作出報告後，已把報告交給相關政‍策‍局作為參考，當中所載的建議政府高度重視，整體安排展現行政立‍法高效務‍實、緊密協作的新氣象。

我和副主席在本年（會期）亦繼續積極擔當議會與行政機關的溝通橋樑，藉着每次內務委‍員‍會會議後與政務司司長的定期會面，保持行‍政立法之間的緊密聯繋。我們每次反映的事‍項，感謝司長很多時也親自積極跟進和處理。

與區議會的互動交流

隨着地區治理體系得到完善，立法會在上個會期與10個區‍議會進行了互動交流，今個會期則繼續安排與另外八個區議會會面，彼此就社區發展和市‍民關注的議題作深入交流和交‍換意見，讓‍立‍法‍會在宏觀的政策層面，聯‍同區‍議‍會在地區治‍理諮詢的層面，積極向政府建言獻‍策，務求令對市民的服務更「接地氣」，提升巿民的幸福感和獲得感。在會‍議上商議的事‍項，會‍視乎情‍況，部分交由政府考‍慮，亦有部分交由立法‍會相‍關的事務委員會作跟進，亦有部分交公共申訴辦‍事‍處處理。議員亦曾就個別（區）議會提出的意見，跟區議會議員「落區」實地考察，以跟進會上討論的事項。

結語

本屆議會任期即將結束，回望過去四年，議‍員以國務院港澳事務辦公室夏寶龍主任對第七屆立‍法‍會上任之初提‍出的「五點希望」為指引，牢記初心使命，積極擔當作為，做好立場堅定的愛國者、行政主導體‍制的維護者、真正的民意代言人、高‍質素的管‍治者，以及立法會新風貌的開創者。立法機關與行政機‍關既互相配合亦互相制衡，不‍斷提升香港治理效能，貫徹落實「一國兩制」。在現時「由治及興」進程的關鍵節點，香港需要變‍革與創新。展‍望未來，我期望在行政長官的帶領下，行政機關與第八屆立法會繼續保持緊密溝通，彼‍此更協同，更好地為香港市民服務。議員作為體制內政策制定的參與者、落實與監督者，定會積極為香港的繁榮穩定貢獻力量，承擔起推動香港社‍會更美好發展、更積極融入國家發展大局的責‍任，合作說好國家和香港故事，做到「民有所呼，為政者有所應」，為香港良政善治更好發揮作用。

最後，我亦再特別感謝陳健波副主席在過去兩‍年擔‍任內務委員會期間盡心盡力；我亦要感謝之前馬逢國副主席，在之前盡心盡力，就‍會‍議的運作提供意見及協助我主持部分會議。大‍家都已經知悉，陳議員已公開宣布不會尋求連任立法會議‍員，我藉此機會感謝他自二○○八年出任立‍法會議‍員以‍來，對議會工作貢獻良多。我亦特別感謝秘‍書‍處團隊和法律顧問在過去一年，以至本屆，為內務委員會、為各個事務委員會，為所有工作小組提‍供了許多專業支援。再次感謝各位議員的付出，因為內會這份亮麗的成績是各位一起創造出來的。"
Government implements quick-win measures to plug procurement loopholes and releases Audit Commission's management letter,2025-10-20 14:45,2025-10-20 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000285.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, announced today (October 20) that the Government Logistics Department (GLD) had implemented six quick-win measures focusing on three aspects, namely institutional change, enhancement of cross-departmental information exchanges and reshaping of work culture, as proposed by the Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime (Task Force) to plug loopholes in government procurement procedures as soon as possible. Furthermore, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) released in full the management letter submitted by the Audit Commission on its review of the incident on the Government's procurement of bottled drinking water to demonstrate the Government's transparency in handling the incident and its commitment to revamp its procurement and contract management regime.

Mr Hui said, ""While the incident on the procurement of bottled drinking water clearly involved suspected fraudulent acts by a particular company, it also revealed that the perceptiveness and alertness of the relevant officers in conducting due diligence checks and addressing potential fraudulent acts could not adapt to the current business environment and were obviously below reasonable expectations. The Task Force and I consider it essential to tackle the problem at source through reshaping the work culture, enhancing the capability of procurement officers in exercising due diligence and empowering officers with sufficient authorities on the regime level. This will help ensure greater effectiveness for officers in handling procurement matters in future, not only serving as advocates of fair competition, but more importantly, as gatekeepers for government procurement.""

He stated that the Task Force, since its establishment in August, had been exploring measures to enhance the tendering and procurement regime and procedures. Among them, the Task Force considered that six quick-win measures should be launched sooner to plug loopholes at the earliest time. The FSTB has directed the GLD to implement these six measures immediately. Details are as follows:

(1) Promulgate internal guidelines to stipulate specific requirements on due diligence checks: The GLD issued an internal memorandum to government officers in late August to remind them of the aspects in the procurement and contract management processes which require proper due diligence checks. The GLD further promulgated today internal operational guidelines which set out specific requirements and provide detailed guidelines on conducting due diligence checks at various stages, including preparation of tender documents, tender evaluation and contract management, to help procurement officers guard against potential fraudulent acts more effectively;

(2) Set up a Procurement and Stores Management Audit Section to step up inspections: The GLD has expanded the functions of its original internal audit team and reorganised it into the Procurement and Stores Management Audit Section starting from October. As a dedicated team for conducting third-party audits, the Section steps up inspections of due diligence work on departments' procurements under a risk-based approach and reports to the relevant Heads of Departments for attention as appropriate;

(3) Revise Standard Terms and Conditions of Tenders and Contracts (STC) to strengthen vetting and contract management power: The GLD has revised the STC today to strengthen the Government's power in tendering and contract management, including requiring tenderers and contractors to give consent to the Government for verifying directly with third parties the authenticity of information submitted, allowing the Government to conduct site visits during the tender evaluation process and throughout the contract period, etc. The revised STC also empowers the Government to terminate contracts immediately if contractors are found to have made material misrepresentations or provided false information;

(4) Establish a digital database for information sharing: Procurement work is not confined to the GLD, as departments may also procure services and goods on their own. To leverage the procurement experience of departments, the GLD established an internal digital database in mid-October to keep collecting from departments information related to contractors' tendering situations and contract performances. The database serves as a government-wide procurement information portal that can be accessed by procurement officers anytime, assisting them to identify high-risk tenderers in a more effective and timely manner;

(5) Strengthen staff training to guard against fraud: The GLD, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, organised five seminars in September. The seminars, with a total attendance of over 750, focused on introducing scam tactics and identification techniques to officers involved in procurement and finance matters for departments to heighten their anti-fraud awareness. Moreover, the GLD is arranging training courses to brief staff thoroughly on the newly issued internal operational guidelines to assist them to grasp the implementation details; and

(6) Build a culture of ownership at work: While procurement work requires adherence to rules, proper execution by staff is of the utmost importance. In working out and implementing the various measures, the GLD encouraged staff to offer their views through multiple channels, including two staff engagement sessions held in September to gauge feedback on due diligence work and the relevant procedures to foster a greater sense of involvement and commitment in the enhancement measures among staff and build a culture of ownership at work. The GLD will continue to instil the ownership mindset of ""procuring for the people with due diligence and dedication"" in the work culture through induction training, regular training activities and staff engagement sessions, etc, such that staff will take ownership of government procurement and be more proactive and prudent.

The Task Force is considering other proposals involving a broader scope, and expects to publish a review report before the end of this year to put forward solutions that address both symptoms and root causes, with a view to further enhancing the Government's procurement work.

Separately, the GLD is reviewing in detail the tender requirements of the contract for the supply of bottled drinking water to government offices. In order to keep tabs on the market pulse prior to tendering, the GLD published a market research notice on its website today, inviting interested suppliers to submit responses in a month's time. The GLD aims to launch the tender exercise for the supply of bottled drinking water to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands, with the relevant responses taken into account, by the end of this year.

Mr Hui also released today the management letter (at Annex) submitted by the Audit Commission on its review of the tender exercise for the procurement of bottled drinking water. He thanked the Audit Commission for providing numerous recommendations, the directions of which align with the six quick-win measures aforementioned and the long-term enhancement measures being explored by the Task Force. The Task Force will examine the management letter in detail to refine the long-term enhancement measures for announcement before the end of the year.

Mr Hui also announced that Ms Alice Lau, Administrative Officer Staff Grade A1, had been invited to conduct a disciplinary investigation on the human errors identified in the management letter.

The Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime was established in August to review the existing government procurement regime and procedures arising from the incident on the Government's procurement of bottled drinking water under a cross-bureau and cross-departmental approach. The Task Force is chaired by Mr Hui, with members that include the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Treasury), the Director of Government Logistics, and representatives from the Civil Service Bureau, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Development Bureau and the Department of Justice."
政府落實先行措施堵塞採購漏洞並公布審計署管理建議書,2025-10-20 14:45,2025-10-20 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000282.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇今日（十月二十日）公布，政府物流服務署（物流署）已落實六項由檢討政府採購機制專責小組（專責小組）提出的先行措施，圍繞制度改革、加強部門間信息互通和重塑工作文化三方面，盡早堵塞政府採購程序的漏洞。另外，財庫局亦全面公開審計署就審查政府採購樽裝飲用水事件提交的管理建議書，以展示政府在處理事件上的透明度和革新採購和合約管理機制的決心。

許正宇說：「今次採購樽裝飲用水事件固然涉及個別公司的懷疑欺詐行為，但同時亦顯示相關人員在盡職審查和應對潛在欺詐行為方面，其洞察力和警覺性未能配合現今商業社會狀況，亦與合理期望有明顯落差。我和專責小組均認為，要確保政府人員日後能更有效執行採購工作，必須從根本去重塑工作文化，提升採購人員的盡職審查能力和在制度上賦予他們足夠權力，讓他們除了擔當公平競爭的推動者，更重要的是做好政府採購的把關者。」

他表示，專責小組自八月成立以來，一直研究各項可完善招標和採購機制和程序的措施。其中，專責小組認為有六項先行措施應盡早推出，以及早堵塞漏洞。財庫局已督導物流署即時落實這六項先行措施，詳情如下：

（一）發放內部指引訂明盡職審查具體要求：物流署在八月底向政府人員發出內部便箋，就採購和管理合約過程中須做好盡職審查的節點作出提醒。物流署今日進一步發放內部工作指引，訂明在擬備招標文件、評審投標書及合約管理各個階段進行盡職審查的具體要求和提供詳細指引，協助採購人員更有效防範潛在欺詐行為；

（二）成立「採購及物料管理審核組」加強抽查：物流署由十月起已擴大原有內部審計專隊的職能，並重組為「採購及物料管理審核組」，作為第三方審查專隊，以風險為本原則加強抽查各部門採購時的盡職審查工作，並適時上報有關部門首長正視；

（三）修訂《招標和合約的標準條款》加強審查和管理合約權力：為加強政府在招標和合約管理方面的權力，物流署今日已修訂《招標和合約的標準條款》，當中涵蓋規定投標者和承辦商須同意政府可直接向第三方核實所提交資料的真確性，並容許政府在審核標書過程和合約期間進行實地視察等。經修訂的條款亦賦權政府在發現承辦商提交虛假陳述或不真確資料時，可即時終止合約；

（四）設立電子資料庫共享資訊：採購工作並不限於物流署，各部門也會自行採購服務和產品。為善用不同部門的採購經驗，物流署十月中已設立內部電子資料庫，持續蒐集各部門有關承辦商投標情況和合約表現的資訊，構建整個政府通用的採購資訊網，供採購人員隨時查閱，從而更有效及早識別高風險投標者；

（五）加強人員培訓防範詐騙：物流署聯同香港警務處和香港海關在九月舉辦了五場講座，重點向各部門負責採購和財務工作的人員講解騙案手法和識別技巧，提升他們的防騙意識，共有逾750人次參加。另外，物流署亦正安排培訓班，向同事詳細講解新訂立的內部工作指引，讓他們能掌握執行細節；及

（六）建立主人翁工作文化：採購工作需有規則依從，但人員的妥善執行亦至關重要。在構思及落實各項措施時，物流署透過不同渠道鼓勵同事提出意見，當中包括在九月舉行兩場員工交流會，聽取他們對做好盡職審查工作和程序的意見，務求他們對各項優化措施有更強的參與感和承擔，從而建立主人翁工作文化。物流署會繼續透過入職培訓、恆常培訓活動和員工交流會等，將「盡職盡心，採購為民」的主人翁工作文化逐步植根同事心中，令他們視政府採購尤如己事，更積極更謹慎。

專責小組正研究一些牽涉面更廣的方案，並預期在今年年底前發表檢討報告，提出達致「表裏兼顧、標本兼治」的方案，讓政府採購工作更臻完善。

此外，物流署正檢視供應政府辦公室樽裝飲用水合約招標要求的細節。為了在招標前更準確掌握市場脈搏，物流署今日已在其網頁公布市場研究公告，邀請有興趣的供應商在一個月內提交回應。物流署考慮有關回應後，目標在今年年底為供應樽裝飲用水予港島和部分離島政府辦公室展開招標工作。

許正宇今日亦公開審計署就審查採購樽裝飲用水招標過程所提交的管理建議書（見附件）。他感謝審計署提出不少建議，並指出建議與上述六項先行措施和專責小組正研究的長遠優化方案方向一致。專責小組會詳細研究管理建議書，以完善年底前提出的長遠優化方案。

許正宇也公布，已邀請首長級甲一級政務官劉焱就管理建議書內所點出的人為疏漏情況進行紀律調查。

檢討政府採購機制專責小組於八月成立，以跨政策局、跨部門形式，從政府採購樽裝飲用水的事件出發，審視現有的政府採購機制和程序。專責小組由許正宇擔任主席，成員包括財庫局常任秘書長（庫務）、物流署署長，以及公務員事務局、商務及經濟發展局、發展局和律政司的代表。"

Court users may use iCMS for personal injuries cases in High Court and seek technical assistance on case initiation ,2025-10-20 12:40,2025-10-20 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000294.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Judiciary:

 The Judiciary announced that starting from October 30, the integrated Court Case Management System (iCMS) will be extended (Note)to cover personal injuries cases (HCPI) in the Court of First Instance of the High Court.

 The iCMS provides a series of electronic services, including sending and receiving case-specific court documents to and from the courts (e-filing), inspecting or searching filed documents and other case-related information held by the courts, searching cause books, and making payments for court services. The Judiciary is planning to make it mandatory for all legally represented parties to use e-filing under the iCMS (where available) as from the latter half of 2026.

 With the iCMS, there is no need to visit the High Court Building to scan (this function is available to Litigants-in-Person only) and upload the electronic copy of the document to be filed using the self-service kiosks located at the Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants or make payments in the Accounts Office for paper filing.

 To facilitate law firms' early migration from conventional paper mode to the iCMS in preparation for mandatory use in 2026, the Judiciary is inviting all law firms to make an appointment with the Judiciary for technical assistance on using the iCMS, either at the High Court Building or their own offices, when they are initiating a new case of an iCMS-enabled case type (including HCPI upon its rollout on October 30) for the first time. Taking into account the law firms' response and available resources, the Judiciary may require all law firms initiating a new case through paper filing to go through this assisted e-filing process for the purpose of enhancing training on iCMS before mandatory e-filing. To encourage migration to the iCMS, a 20 per cent concession is offered to iCMS users for three years on fee items of the High Court that are primarily or directly related to the electronic handling of court documents.

 Eligible users, including parties of ongoing or new e-proceedings and their legal representatives (if any), need to register for a user account to access the full range of services under the iCMS. Unregistered users can only use limited iCMS services, mainly searching for electronic documents that are open to public inspection. Registration is free of charge.
 
 The iCMS can be accessed using personal computers or mobile devices with an Internet connection, commonly used operating systems and browsers. It operates around the clock, except during system maintenance. Any e-filing and e-payment received under the iCMS after the registry and the accounts office are normally closed to the public (i.e. after 5.30pm on a working day) will be deemed to be received at the start of the normal opening hours of the registry and the accounts office on the following working day.

 For more details about the iCMS, including its technical requirements, please visit the dedicated webpage on e-Courts of the Judiciary website at www.judiciary.hk/en/e_courts/index.html.

 For enquiries, please call the general enquiry hotline at 2477 1002 or the technical helpline at 2886 6474, emailenquiry@judiciary.hk, or visit the Help Centre at 5/F, Wanchai Tower, 12 Harbour Road, Wan Chai.

Note: The iCMS application currently covers personal injury actions, tax claim proceedings, civil action proceedings and employees' compensation cases in the District Court, summons cases in the Magistrates' Courts, bulk claims in the Small Claims Tribunal, and selected case types of civil proceedings of the High Court, including civil appeal cases (CACV) in the Court of Appeal and commercial cases (HCCL), construction and arbitration cases (HCCT) and intellectual property cases (HCIP) in the Court of First Instance."
Speech by CE at Inauguration Ceremony of International Organization for Mediation (English only) (with photos/video),2025-10-20 12:20,2025-10-20 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000351.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Inauguration Ceremony of the International Organization for Mediation today (October 20):

Honourable Vice Minister Hua Chunying (Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs), Your Excellencies, representatives of contracting states, ministers and officials from around the world, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am very honoured to join you today, for the inauguration of the International Organization for Mediation.

  I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to my country, China, for its steadfast support; and to the International Organization for Mediation's contracting states and signatory states, for their confidence in Hong Kong, as home to the Organization's headquarters.

  The headquarters is housed in this newly renovated building, a police station for almost a century. The renovation, completed within 14 months, harmoniously blends the building's historic origins with modern design, preserving architectural features, while drawing inspiration from Chinese porcelain.

  More than stone and mortar, this thoughtful transformation embodies the essential spirit of mediation – uniting diverse elements in balance and harmony, creating a place ideally suited for peaceful resolution.

  In these times of global instability, international mediation is indispensable for resolving disputes, preserving relationships and encouraging meaningful co-operation. With our world-class professional services, Hong Kong is dedicated to supporting the cause of dispute resolution.

  Under the unique ""one country, two systems""principle, Hong Kong enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage. We pride ourselves with our established tradition of the rule of law, and a common law regime shared by many global financial hubs. Our three law schools are all ranked within the world's top 60, and nurture outstanding talent in legal and dispute resolution services.

  Our flagship legal event Hong Kong Legal Week, in December, will include a session on international mediation. And in 2026, during Hong Kong Mediation Week, we will organise a global mediation summit, bringing together mediation practitioners, policymakers and thought leaders from around the world.

  We are equally committed to capacity building. The Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, launched last year by our Department of Justice, equips mediators and legal professionals with the skills to meet international standards.

  In my Policy Address last month, I announced the development of the Hong Kong International Legal Service Building, on a site adjacent to us here. It will provide additional facilities for the Organization, and be home to the International Legal Talents Training Academy.

  Ladies and gentlemen, today's inauguration is a testament of our shared commitment to a future in which dialogue, co-operation and mutual respect prevail over acrimony and conflict.

  As I said in May, at the signing of the convention establishing the Organization, Hong Kong builds bridges. We take pride in being a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"". And we are honoured to serve as the Organization's home.

  I am confident that, under the joint dedication of all contracting states and the SecretaryâGeneral's stewardship, the International Organization for Mediation will rise as a respected and trusted body for resolving disputes through mutual respect and understanding.

  I wish the International Organization for Mediation every success.

  Thank you."

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to this Legal Practical Training Course for Chinese Enterprises Going Overseas, organised by the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy of the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government.

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council of the People's Republic of China (SASAC), especially the SASAC Bureau of Policies, Laws and Regulations for making this course a reality. With the strong support of SASAC, we have the privilege to convene 30 general counsel and senior legal officers from our country's leading state-owned enterprises under one roof. I understand we also invited three senior legal counsel from leading private companies. I also welcome colleagues from the Ministry of Commerce, who are with us here today. I extend my heartfelt thanks to each of you for taking the time to join us in Hong Kong for this course.

Traditionally, Hong Kong has been a springboard for Mainland enterprises to go global. This unique position is rooted in Hong Kong's status under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, making it the only bilingual common law jurisdiction in China where both Chinese and English are official languages. Such distinct advantages enable Hong Kong to act as a ""super connector"" and a significant value-adder between the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world. Hong Kong continues to be the first stop for numerous Chinese companies establishing their overseas bases and seeking IPOs (initial public offerings). In the first half of 2025 alone, Hong Kong's IPO market raised an impressive HK$107.1 billion through 42 listings, marking a 700 per cent increase in funds raised and a 40 per cent rise in deal volume. This extraordinary performance positions Hong Kong as the top global fundraising hub, reinforcing its pivotal role as an international financial centre and a gateway for Chinese enterprises' global expansion.

As our country transforms from rapid growth to high-quality development, more and more outstanding Mainland enterprises are actively expanding to overseas markets. However, this new phase of global expansion also presents challenges. Chinese enterprises face increasing geopolitical uncertainties, diverse regulatory environments, and increasing compliance demands across different markets. Supply chain complexities and cost pressures continue to test operational resilience. Furthermore, adapting to local legal, cultural, and economic conditions remains critical for sustainable success.

Under these circumstances, the roles of legal counsel of enterprises have become more critical than a mere advisor or head of a legal division traditionally in the past. Nowadays, legal counsel often have to play the role as an architect of risk management framework, as a gatekeeper of compliance, and as a compass directing strategic decision-making for the enterprises or organisations as a whole. Legal counsel have to operate at the intersections of law, policy, and business, where your advice has direct implications on economic security and corporate reputation. This course is therefore profoundly important, as it aims to equip you with the cutting-edge knowledge and practical skills that will enable you to guide your enterprises or organisations towards sustained excellence and growth.

As announced in the Policy Address 2025 last month, the Chief Executive has highlighted the significant role of Hong Kong's legal services sector in supporting Mainland enterprises. Our Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Horace Cheung, is specifically tasked to promote Hong Kong's legal services and collaborate with other professional sectors, including accounting and finance, to provide robust support for Mainland enterprises aspiring to expand overseas. This course arrives at just the right time to take forward this very important initiative under the Policy Address.

We hope that this course could provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the current trends in overseas expansion, the evolving legal and regulatory challenges, the best practices for compliance and practical tools for navigating these complexities. We will delve into critical areas such as mergers and acquisitions, export control and sanctions, compliance, international commercial and investment arbitration, international trade instruments and regulations, transaction and dispute resolution involving sovereign states, intellectual property international strategies as well as hot topics such as stablecoins. In addition, we will have dedicated regional panels focusing on Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa respectively, where we invited 13 senior practitioners from 12 jurisdictions, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Vietnam to share their first-hand experience and local insights. I encourage you to actively interact with these panelists and share your experience with them, including any difficulties or challenges that you have faced or may face in these regions. We will also explore case studies to illustrate some critical legal and strategic issues.

We hope that by the end of this course, you will be well positioned to leverage Hong Kong's unique legal and dispute resolution advantages. We encourage you to make use of Hong Kong's robust legal infrastructure, wealth of expertise and world-class legal services as key resources to support and enhance your enterprises' overseas endeavours.

Beyond acquiring technical knowledge, this course also provides a unique opportunity to build and strengthen connections among peers facing similar challenges. We believe that, by sharing your insights and experiences with one another, you will be able to build a strong network that helps each of you grow professionally and enriches the collective wisdom that drives our success during times of uncertainty under the rapidly changing international landscape.

Before I end, I would like to take a moment to introduce the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, which will soon be approaching its first anniversary. Since its launch last November, the Academy has co-organised a number of training programmes in Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and abroad, covering a variety of topics and targeting a wide spectrum of participants. Through organising practical legal courses, seminars and international exchange programmes, the Academy promotes international legal talent exchanges. This will help to consolidate Hong Kong's strategic position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region, establish Hong Kong as a capacity-building hub, and actively participate in the next decade of the Belt and Road Initiative, contributing to the country's efforts to promote the construction of the rule of law. I thank you all for your valuable support of the Academy thus far, and warmly encourage your continued engagement and collaboration with the Academy.

The Department of Justice will be hosting its annual flagship event, the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025, from December 1 to 5 this year. It is a fruitful week filled with opportunities to connect, learn, and engage with eminent legal minds from around the world. On December 1, the Academy will co-organise the 6th UNCITRAL Asia-Pacific Judicial Summit 2025 - Judicial Conference together with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). Themed ""Building towards End-to-End Digitalization"", this judicial conference will explore topics related to the application of digital economy, virtual assets, artificial intelligence and technology in the judicial field. On December 2, we will co-organise The Third Legal Forum on Interconnectivity and Development with the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR. On December 3, the Academy will co-organise A Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific on Private International Law with the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Prominent international speakers such as the Secretary-General of international organisations and prominent overseas experts will be speaking at these events. They will certainly give you valuable insights and provide you with abundant opportunities to engage in meaningful discussions with these experts. You are warmly invited to participate in these events, as well as the other events focusing on dispute resolution, Greater Bay Area development and rule of law throughout the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

While you are in Hong Kong for this one-week course, I encourage you to take some time to explore the city. Beyond its status as the leading international legal and financial centre, Hong Kong is a vibrant city full of rich culture, delicious cuisine, and stunning sights. I hope you have the opportunity to experience the unique charm of this remarkable city alongside your learning journey.

In conclusion, I wish you all an engaging, insightful and productive experience in the coming week. I look forward to meeting you again during the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025. Thank you."

In the first half of 2025 alone, Hong Kong's IPO market raised an impressive HK$107.1 billion through 42 listings, marking a 700 per cent increase in funds raised and a 40 per cent rise in deal volume. This extraordinary performance positions Hong Kong as the top global fundraising hub, reinforcing its pivotal role as an international financial centre and a gateway for Chinese enterprises' global expansion.

As our country transforms from rapid growth to high-quality development, more and more outstanding Mainland enterprises are actively expanding to overseas markets. However, this new phase of global expansion also presents challenges. Chinese enterprises face increasing geopolitical uncertainties, diverse regulatory environments, and increasing compliance demands across different markets. Supply chain complexities and cost pressures continue to test operational resilience. Furthermore, adapting to local legal, cultural, and economic conditions remains critical for sustainable success.

Under these circumstances, the roles of legal counsel of enterprises have become more critical than a mere advisor or head of a legal division traditionally in the past. Nowadays, legal counsel often have to play the role as an architect of risk management framework, as a gatekeeper of compliance, and as a compass directing strategic decision-making for the enterprises or organisations as a whole. Legal counsel have to operate at the intersections of law, policy, and business, where your advice has direct implications on economic security and corporate reputation. This course is therefore profoundly important, as it aims to equip you with the cutting-edge knowledge and practical skills that will enable you to guide your enterprises or organisations towards sustained excellence and growth.

As announced in the Policy Address 2025 last month, the Chief Executive has highlighted the significant role of Hong Kong's legal services sector in supporting Mainland enterprises. Our Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Horace Cheung, is specifically tasked to promote Hong Kong's legal services and collaborate with other professional sectors, including accounting and finance, to provide robust support for Mainland enterprises aspiring to expand overseas. This course arrives at just the right time to take forward this very important initiative under the Policy Address.

We hope that this course could provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the current trends in overseas expansion, the evolving legal and regulatory challenges, the best practices for compliance and practical tools for navigating these complexities. We will delve into critical areas such as mergers and acquisitions, export control and sanctions, compliance, international commercial and investment arbitration, international trade instruments and regulations, transaction and dispute resolution involving sovereign states, intellectual property international strategies as well as hot topics such as stablecoins. In addition, we will have dedicated regional panels focusing on Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa respectively, where we invited 13 senior practitioners from 12 jurisdictions, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Vietnam to share their first-hand experience and local insights. I encourage you to actively interact with these panelists and share your experience with them, including any difficulties or challenges that you have faced or may face in these regions. We will also explore case studies to illustrate some critical legal and strategic issues.

We hope that by the end of this course, you will be well positioned to leverage Hong Kong's unique legal and dispute resolution advantages. We encourage you to make use of Hong Kong's robust legal infrastructure, wealth of expertise and world-class legal services as key resources to support and enhance your enterprises' overseas endeavours.

Beyond acquiring technical knowledge, this course also provides a unique opportunity to build and strengthen connections among peers facing similar challenges. We believe that, by sharing your insights and experiences with one another, you will be able to build a strong network that helps each of you grow professionally and enriches the collective wisdom that drives our success during times of uncertainty under the rapidly changing international landscape.

Before I end, I would like to take a moment to introduce the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, which will soon be approaching its first anniversary. Since its launch last November, the Academy has co-organised a number of training programmes in Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and abroad, covering a variety of topics and targeting a wide spectrum of participants. Through organising practical legal courses, seminars and international exchange programmes, the Academy promotes international legal talent exchanges. This will help to consolidate Hong Kong's strategic position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region, establish Hong Kong as a capacity-building hub, and actively participate in the next decade of the Belt and Road Initiative, contributing to the country's efforts to promote the construction of the rule of law. I thank you all for your valuable support of the Academy thus far, and warmly encourage your continued engagement and collaboration with the Academy.

The Department of Justice will be hosting its annual flagship event, the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025, from December 1 to 5 this year. It is a fruitful week filled with opportunities to connect, learn, and engage with eminent legal minds from around the world. On December 1, the Academy will co-organise the 6th UNCITRAL Asia-Pacific Judicial Summit 2025 - Judicial Conference together with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). Themed ""Building towards End-to-End Digitalization"", this judicial conference will explore topics related to the application of digital economy, virtual assets, artificial intelligence and technology in the judicial field. On December 2, we will co-organise The Third Legal Forum on Interconnectivity and Development with the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR. On December 3, the Academy will co-organise A Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific on Private International Law with the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Prominent international speakers such as the Secretary-General of international organisations and prominent overseas experts will be speaking at these events. They will certainly give you valuable insights and provide you with abundant opportunities to engage in meaningful discussions with these experts. You are warmly invited to participate in these events, as well as the other events focusing on dispute resolution, Greater Bay Area development and rule of law throughout the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

While you are in Hong Kong for this one-week course, I encourage you to take some time to explore the city. Beyond its status as the leading international legal and financial centre, Hong Kong is a vibrant city full of rich culture, delicious cuisine, and stunning sights. I hope you have the opportunity to experience the unique charm of this remarkable city alongside your learning journey.

In conclusion, I wish you all an engaging, insightful and productive experience in the coming week. I look forward to meeting you again during the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025. Thank you."
羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團十一月重臨香江　與國際知名鋼琴家和歌劇演唱家呈獻兩場音樂會（附圖）,2025-10-20 11:00,2025-10-20 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025101600479.htm,"闊別香港七年的羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團將由新任藝術總監兼世界級指揮丹尼奧‧哈汀帶領下於十一月亮相康樂及文化事務署（康文署）的「音樂盛會二○二五」。香港作為樂團本年亞洲巡演首站，兩場演出更分別邀得近年歐美古典音樂界寵兒、著名意大利鋼琴家貝雅斯‧拉娜首度來港合作演出拉威爾的作品，以及三名當今享負盛名的歌劇演唱家壓軸演繹華格納的《女武神》第一幕，樂迷和歌劇迷均不容錯過。

兩場音樂會將以威爾第的大型歌劇《西西里晚禱》的序曲拉開帷幕。首場（十一月二十日）樂團另將與鋼琴家貝雅斯‧拉娜攜手演繹拉威爾的《G大調鋼琴協奏曲》，此曲受爵士音樂和巴斯克民樂風格影響，讓鋼琴與樂團來一場極富節奏感和娛樂性的對話。樂團亦以拉赫曼尼諾夫的《E小調第二交響曲，作品二十七》為該晚演出作結。

次場（十一月二十一日）的選曲均出自歌劇大師之作，包括羅西尼《威廉泰爾》和威爾第《命運之力》的序曲。樂團更將其今個樂季的開幕節目——華格納《指環》四部曲之二《女武神》第一幕的音樂會版本搬到香港演出，並由男高音克勞斯‧弗洛里安‧福茨、女高音米娜—莉莎‧瓦雷萊和男低音延侊哲分別聲演眾神之王伏坦的雙胞胎子女西格蒙和西格琳，以及西格琳的丈夫胡定。在是次亞洲巡演中，樂團僅在香港站上演此音樂會版本。

羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團成立於一九○八年，是意大利第一隊以演奏交響樂曲為宗旨的樂團，首演了多首二十世紀的傑作，其中包括意大利作曲家雷史碧基的《羅馬之泉》和《羅馬之松》。樂團曾與多位音樂大師合作，包括指揮家馬勒、德布西、理查•史特勞斯、史達拉汶斯基、西貝流士、亨德密特、托斯卡尼尼等，亦曾在柏林愛樂音樂廳、森柏歌劇院、維也納的音樂協會和音樂廳等著名音樂廳演出。近年樂團的錄音活動屢獲國際殊榮，當中錄製的浦契尼《杜蘭朵》更獲得國際古典音樂獎「最佳歌劇」獎。

丹尼奧・哈汀現為羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團及合唱團的音樂總監和粵港澳大灣區國際青年音樂周的音樂總監。他指揮馬勒室樂團20餘年，榮獲該樂團終身桂冠指揮頭銜，另擔任了瑞典廣播交響樂團的音樂及藝術總監18年。哈汀亦曾在米蘭史卡拉歌劇院、維也納國家歌劇院、皇家歌劇院、普羅旺斯艾克斯音樂節和薩爾斯堡音樂節等指揮廣受好評的歌劇作品。哈汀於二○○二年獲法國政府授予法國藝術與文學騎士勳章，並於二○一七年獲頒軍官榮譽。

鋼琴家貝雅斯・拉娜於年僅18歲時已在蒙特利爾國際音樂比賽中奪得首獎及所有特別獎項，其後於二○一三范・克萊本國際鋼琴比賽中獲得銀獎及觀眾獎而廣受矚目。二○一五年與羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團合作錄製首張專輯，收錄浦羅歌菲夫《第二鋼琴協奏曲》和柴可夫斯基《第一鋼琴協奏曲》，獲得國際讚譽，並成為《留聲機》雜誌的編輯之選。二○一七年更榮獲《留聲機》雜誌「年度青年藝術家獎」。

米娜—莉莎・瓦雷萊被《歌劇雜誌》盛讚為「戲劇界女高音中最具潛力的新星之一」。她曾於杜達美指揮下與洛杉磯愛樂樂團合作，演繹華格納的《崔斯坦與伊索德》，今年更初登華格納歌劇年度盛事—拜羅伊特歌劇節，表現一鳴驚人。

克勞斯・弗洛里安・福茨憑其別樹一格的歌聲被譽為當代最傑出的華格納男高音之一，以華格納的《羅恩格林》中聖杯武士一角享譽國際，足跡遍及世界各大歌劇舞台，包括大都會歌劇院、皇家歌劇院、維也納國家歌劇院等。他更榮獲OPER! Awards 2025最佳男歌手奬項。

延侊哲是當今備受矚目的低音聲樂家之一，曾於多個國際歌劇舞台演出，包括巴黎歌劇院、維也納國家歌劇院和柏林國立歌劇院等。他於二○一八年獲柏林國立歌劇院授予「榮譽歌手」榮銜，同年獲頒湖巖藝術獎，確立其韓國國寶級演唱家的地位。

有關個䅁涉及元朗丈量約份第115約其中兩個地段上一幢四層高面積約100平方米的搭建物。由於有關僭建物不會獲地政總署發出豁免證明書，亦並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署遂根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向該兩名共同業主發出清拆令。他們沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（十月二十日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"

Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia - Roma returns to Hong Kong to give two concerts with acclaimed pianist and opera vocalists in November (with photos),2025-10-20 11:00,2025-10-20 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025101600489.htm,"ããThe Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia - Roma, returning to Hong Kong after a seven-year absence, will grace the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's (LCSD) Great Music 2025 this November under the baton of its newly appointed artistic director, the world-class conductor Daniel Harding. Marking the first stop of the Orchestra's Asian tour this year, the two concerts present exceptional collaborations, featuring the celebrated Italian pianist Beatrice Rana, a rising star on the European and American classical music scene, who will make her Hong Kong debut to perform a Ravel work, and three of today's most acclaimed opera vocalists that will conclude the programme with a grand rendition of Act I of Wagner's ""Die Walküre"". This is an unmissable event for both classical music and opera lovers.

ããThe two concerts will open with the overture from Verdi's grand opera ""Les vÈpres siciliennes"". The first concert (November 20) will also feature pianist Rana, joining the Orchestra for a performance of Ravel's ""Piano Concerto in G"" - a work infused with jazz and Basque folk music elements that creates a rhythmically vibrant and entertaining dialogue between the piano and the orchestra. The evening will conclude with Rachmaninov's ""Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 27"".

ããThe second concert (November 21) is dedicated to masterpieces by great opera composers, featuring the overtures from Rossini's ""William Tell"" and Verdi's ""La forza del destino"". The Orchestra will also present a concert version of Act I of Wagner's ""Die Walküre"" - the second installment of the ""Ring"" cycle, and the very piece that opened its current season. The performance boasts a stellar cast, with tenor Klaus Florian Vogt and soprano Miina-Liisa Värelä as the god Wotan's twins Siegmund and Sieglinde, and bass Kwangchul Youn portraying Sieglinde's husband Hunding.

It has performed in prestigious concert halls, such as the Berlin Philharmonie, Semperoper Dresden, and the Musikverein and Konzerthaus in Vienna.

"Two co-owners fined over $130,000 for not complying with removal order",2025-10-20 11:00,2025-10-20 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000246.htm,"âTwo co-owners were convicted and fined $136,800 in total, of which $76,800 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued at the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts last Friday (October 17) for failing to comply with a removal order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap 123).

The case involved a four-storey unauthorised structure with an area of about 100 square metres on two lots in D.D.115, Yuen Long. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the unauthorised building works (UBWs) and the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the co-owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (October 20), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

At the award presentation ceremony for the basketball competition, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Teens and Elderly Mission Committee for their support of this programme, as well as all participating teams for giving their best. He encouraged young people to develop teamwork skills through sports, and more importantly, to stay away from the temptation of drugs and illegal activities. He mentioned that the winning teams will engage in a series of volunteer services to contribute to society and will have the opportunity to visit the Mainland for competitions and exchange programmes. They will gain valuable experience of our country’s development and deepen their understanding of our country.

Youth are now growing up in an increasingly complex environment, shaped by rapid advancements in cyber technology and fraught with various temptations and traps, including the emerging drug etomidate and constantly evolving scam tactics. The success of youth crime prevention efforts is attributed to the sustained deepening of collaboration among all societal stakeholders and the Police. By combining insights and leveraging synergies, crime prevention messages and proper values can be instilled into the moral virtues of communities and young individuals, more broadly and profoundly.

Sponsored by the Hong Kong Jockey Club and launched in June, the JPC Anti-Narcotics and Fight Crime 3x3 Basketball Training Programme 2025 engaged nearly 6000 teachers and students from 66 secondary and primary schools. This year-long initiative delivers anti-drug and crime prevention messages through diverse activities, including basketball training and school talks, fostering positive mindsets among participants.

The basketball competition under the programme attracted 216 teams, comprising around 900 players from nearly 100 secondary and primary schools. The participating teams encompassed diverse ethnic backgrounds and included students from a Greater Bay Area school. Forty-eight elite teams progressed to today’s finals, vying for the championship, runner-up, and third-place positions in four men’s and four women’s divisions, along with accolades for Top Scorer and Most Valuable Player.

Today’s carnival featured 20 game booths on crime prevention themes, providing participants with opportunities to learn about the dangers of drug abuse and the latest scam tactics. The NSpeed National Security Express Promotional Truck was also on site, promoting national security awareness among the public through interactive displays."

現今年青人的成長環境因為網絡科技急速發展變得越來越複雜，亦充斥不同的誘惑和陷阱，例如新興毒品依托咪酯和變化多端的騙案手法。青少年防罪工作的成功，有賴社會各界持份者和警方持續深化合作，集思廣益，發揮協同效應，將滅罪防罪的信息及正確價值觀更廣泛及更深刻地注入社區及年青人的道德觀念中。

「少年警訊禁毒防罪3x3籃球培訓計劃2025」由香港賽馬會贊助，於六月展開，全港66間中小學近6 000名師生參與。計劃為期一年，透過籃球訓練、校園講座等多元化活動，傳遞禁毒防罪信息，助他們建立正向思維。

計劃下的籃球比賽吸引近100間中小學，約900名健兒組成216支隊伍參賽，當中包括不同種族的學生和來自大灣區的學校。48支精英隊伍在初賽中脫穎而出，晉身今日決賽，爭奪男女子各四個組別的冠、亞、季軍，最佳神射手及最有價值球員獎項。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-19 17:30,2025-10-19 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101900495.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 19), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 41 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 086 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 12 to 18), showing a decrease compared to the previous week, which reported 2 257 cases (October 5 to 11). Most of the cases (795 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (241 cases), Shenzhen (202 cases) and Guangzhou (189 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââââ
  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

76th Anniversary of Founding of People's Republic of China and Mountaineering Safety Promotion Day 2025 held (with photos),2025-10-19 17:20,2025-10-19 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101800401.htm," The Civil Aid Service (CAS) held the 76th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China and Mountaineering Safety Promotion Day 2025 with various government departments and mountaineering organisations today (October 19) at Quarry Bay Park with a view to enhancing public awareness of hiking safety and reducing accidents arising from mountaineering activities.

 Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk, thanked the various disciplined services, auxiliary services and mountaineering organisations for establishing a solid safety net for Hong Kong's outdoor activities. He especially reminded the public that when choosing to hike on dangerous terrain, any accident not only endangers the hiker but also puts rescuers at risk. Therefore, when participating in such high-risk activities, safety must be the primary consideration to ensure the safety of oneself and others.

  Mr Cheuk also stressed that, with the development of the lowâaltitude economy, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the CAS have been studying the use of drones for efficient search and rescue operations. This not only improves rescue efficiency but also reduces the risk to rescuers.

  Then, Mr Cheuk presented certificates of completion to those who had finished the Mountain Casualty Handling Course as well as the Hiking Safety and Mountain Rescue Course.

 The Chief Staff Officer of the CAS, Mr Leung Kwun-hong, also expressed his gratitude to various government departments and organisations for their joint efforts in promoting mountain safety and ensuring the safety of citizens. He said that the FSD, the HKPF, and the Government Flying Service (GFS) have always been important partners of the CAS in mountain search and rescue operations. They have fought side by side with the CAS, successfully rescuing trapped persons and demonstrating a high level of professionalism and selfless dedication.

 Other attending guests included the Director of Operations of the HKPF, Mr Lui Kam-ho; the Deputy Director of Fire Services (Operations), Mr Derek Chan; and the Controller of GFS, Mr Eddie Liu, as well as representatives from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, the Office of the Communications Authority, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Auxiliary Medical Service, the Lands Department, and various mountaineering organisations.

 The promotion day featured booth games designed to raise awareness about mountain activity safety. It also showcased a variety of mountain activity equipment and demonstrated techniques for mountain search and rescue as well as handling injured individuals, allowing the public to gain a better understanding of the work involved in mountain rescue operations.

  A special highlight of the event was the opportunity for citizens to take photos with working dogs from the various disciplined forces, sharing a fun experience together."

保安局副局長卓孝業在開幕禮致辭時，感謝各部隊及山嶺機構為香港山野活動建立了穩固的安全網。他特別提醒市民，當選擇在地勢險要的山徑行山時，一旦發生意外，除了自身面臨危險外，也會將救援人員置於險境。因此，參與這類高風險活動時，必須以安全為首要考慮，確保自己及他人的安全。

卓孝業亦強調，隨着低空經濟的發展，香港警務處、消防處和民安隊已積極研究利用無人機進行高效搜救。除了提升救援效率，更減少了救援人員的風險。

其後，卓孝業頒發結業證書予完成「山嶺傷者處理課程」及「登山安全及攀山搶救課程」的學員。

民眾安全服務處總參事梁冠康亦感謝各政府部門及團體攜手推動山嶺安全，保障市民安全。他說，消防處、香港警務處以及政府飛行服務隊在山嶺搜救行動中一直是民安隊的重要夥伴，與民安隊並肩作戰，成功救援被困人士，展現出高度的專業精神與無私奉獻。

其他出席嘉賓包括香港警務處行動處處長呂錦豪、消防處副處長（行動）陳慶勇、政府飛行服務隊總監廖嘉俊，以及漁農自然護理署、通訊事務管理局辦公室、香港天文台、康樂及文化事務署、醫療輔助隊、地政總署和多個山嶺活動團體的代表。

大會更特別安排了市民與各紀律部隊的工作犬合照，與市民同樂。"
Award Presentation Ceremony of Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards held today (with photos),2025-10-19 16:57,2025-10-19 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101900453.htm,"The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) hosted the Award Presentation Ceremony of the Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards today (October 19) to recognise 15 winning families and promote good family values and traditional virtues to the community and the younger generations. The Deputy Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, and the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, officiated at the ceremony.

In his speech, Mr Cheuk noted that China's long-standing culture and society have always emphasised family harmony and valued good family values and virtues. As President Xi Jinping said, ""The family is the basic cell of society. Family harmony leads to social stability. Family happiness creates social harmony."" The National 14th Five-Year Plan clearly states the need to strengthen family building. The Law of the People's Republic of China on Family Education Promotion, implemented by the State in 2022, elevates family education from a ""family matter"" to a ""national matter,"" fully reflecting our country's focus on family education and the promotion of the fine Chinese traditions. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been actively responding to national policies, and strives to promote the building of a family-friendly society and the healthy development of families in Hong Kong.

Miss Mak expressed her gratitude to the general public for their active participation and support by sharing their family life and insights on nurturing family relationships. She noted that each participant's story is unique, which allows the others to deeply appreciate the family values and virtues of excellent families. She hoped that the event would facilitate the passing down of genuine bonds of family to the next generation, highlighting the significance of family.

She said, ""Hong Kong is our big family. Harmony in the family will bring prosperity for all. Family harmony is not only the source of personal happiness, but also a vital foundation for social prosperity and steady progress. I look forward to continuing to work hand in hand with everyone to enhance society's recognition of family values and promote positive family values and virtues.""

Also officiating at the ceremony were the members of the Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards adjudication panel, including the President of Legislative Council, Mr Andrew Leung; the Vice-Chairperson of the Connecting Hearts, Professor Annie Tam; the Chairperson of the Family Council, Ms Melissa Pang; the Convenor of the Family Council Sub-committee on Promotion of Family Core Values and Family Education, Mr Felix Law; and the Under Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Mr Clarence Leung.

The HYAB and Family Council co-organised the Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards in April this year. The event is open to all Hong Kong citizens. With the focus on ""Fostering Stable Family Relationships for Building Good Family Values and Virtues"", the event promotes the importance of good family values and passing down good family traditions and virtues to the community and the younger generations by recognising families that show mutual respect, care, love and support for one another. The event received an enthusiastic response, attracting approximately 1 200 families to participate. The adjudication panel, comprising community representatives as well as representatives from the HYAB and the Family Council, have selected 15 winning families after careful assessment and deliberation. These included 10 recipients of the ""Excellent Families Award"" and five recipients of the ""Passage of Good Family Values and Virtues Award"". At the Award Presentation Ceremony, the winning families shared their experiences and insights on fostering strong family relationships, promoting positive family culture and values, as well as fine family traditions and virtues to the public."

卓永興致辭時表示，中國源遠流長的文化和社會一直重視家庭和諧，珍視良好家教家風。正如習近平主席說：「家庭是社會的細胞。家庭和睦則社會安定，家庭幸福則社會祥和。」國家《十四五規劃綱要》明確提出要加強家庭建設。國家在二○二二年實施的《家庭教育促進法》，更將家庭教育由「家事」提升為「國事」，充分體現國家對家庭教育和弘揚中華民族優良傳統的重視。特區政府一直積極響應國家政策，致力推動家庭友善社會的建設及香港家庭的健康發展。

麥美娟感謝市民的踴躍參與及支持，分享他們與家人的點滴及維繫家庭關係的心得。她表示，參加者的故事每一個都獨一無二，讓人深刻體會到美好家庭的家教家風。她期望，活動能讓真摯的親情傳承給下一代，彰顯家庭的意義。

她說: 「香港就是我們共同的大家庭。家和萬事興，家庭和睦，不僅是個人幸福的源泉，更是社會繁榮、穩步向前的重要根基。我期待與各位繼續攜手同行，共同增進社會對家庭價值的認同，宣揚優良的家教與家風。」

民青局及家庭議會於今年四月舉辦全港美好家庭選舉，公開邀請全港市民報名參與。活動以「建立穩固家庭關係樹立良好家教家風」為重點，藉以表揚相敬相愛、互相關懷支持的家庭，向社會及年輕一代宣揚良好的家庭價值和傳承良好家風與美德。活動反應熱烈，吸引約1 200個家庭報名參加。由社會人士、民青局代表及家庭議會代表組成的評審委員會經過仔細評審後，選出15個得獎家庭，分別為10個「美好家庭獎」和五個「良好家教家風傳承獎」。得獎家庭在頒獎典禮上分享他們維繫良好家庭關係的經驗和心得，向市民大眾推廣積極正面的家庭文化及價值觀，以及優良的家風和傳統美德。"

梁君彥主席（立法會主席）、譚贛蘭教授（香港社福界心連心大行動副主席）、彭韻僖主席（家庭議會主席）、陳清霞主席（婦女事務委員會主席）、各位家庭議會及婦女事務委員會成員、各位立法會議員、各位校長、各位同學、各位爺爺嫲嫲、公公婆婆和乖孫、乖仔、乖女：

​大家好！今天很多家庭幾代同堂一起參與這個活動，首先感謝大家出席全港美好家庭選舉頒獎典禮，一同分享得獎家庭的喜悅，為他們所展現的家庭凝聚力點讚。

​​和諧的家庭是社會穩定的基石。正如政務司副司長剛才提到，特區政府一直重視香港家庭的健康發展。民青局與家庭議會一直緊密合作，透過多項活動，提倡重視家庭，推廣家庭核心價值，營造關愛和睦的社會氛圍。

​​今年，我們推出全港美好家庭選舉，希望向社會大眾進一步宣揚良好家庭價值，加強家庭、家教、家風的建設工作。我很高興這項目收到接近1 200個家庭參加，我們由衷感謝各位市民、各位朋友的踴躍參與及支持，大家都無私和慷慨地分享他們與家人的生活點滴。

​​在仔細閱覽所有故事的過程中，我們深受感動，每一個家庭的故事都獨一無二，充滿真情實感，這讓我們深刻體會到美好家庭的樣貌多元而豐富，遠非單一標準所能衡量。這些故事告訴我們，美好家庭不一定要由驚天動地的故事來定義。一份真摯的親情、一套傳承給下一代的家庭傳統，往往更能彰顯家庭的意義。正因所有參賽家庭都如此優秀，令評審工作變得十分艱難。我在看大家的參賽作品時一直在想，幸好我不用當評審，否則很難決定結果，所以辛苦了梁主席、譚教授、彭主席和羅輝先生（家庭議會轄下家庭核心價值及家庭教育推廣小組委員會召集人）為我們擔任評審。在這個艱難的評審工作完成後，經過仔細遴選，並邀請了入圍家庭會面，最終評選出10個「美好家庭獎」和五個「良好家教家風傳承獎」的得主。

​​我代表民青局，特別感謝立法會主席梁君彥議員、香港社福界心連心大行動副主席譚贛蘭教授、家庭議會主席彭韻僖女士，以及家庭議會轄下家庭核心價值及家庭教育推廣小組委員會召集人羅輝先生。各位在百忙中撥冗，與民青局的代表一齊擔任評審。我知道很多入圍家庭對能夠跟你們親身會面都感到雀躍。我聽同事說，有些來面試的家庭表示獲獎與否不要緊，獲獎當然開心，不獲獎也不要緊，因為可以見到大主席，平時只能夠在電視機見到大主席。多謝大主席為我們擔任評審工作。今日各位親臨頒獎典禮現場，表揚得獎家庭，非常感謝各位。

​​同時，我要感謝海洋公園、黃廷方慈善基金及信和集團對這個項目的鼎力支持，贊助這個項目的獎品，並派出代表今日到場支持得獎家庭；也要感謝團體協助宣傳，讓更多家庭關注這個項目。正是透過政、商、民三方的緊密合作，這項富有意義的活動得以順利完成。

​​我衷心祝賀在座每個得獎家庭。你們每一份參賽作品，我都有細閱。雖然大家背景各異、經歷不同，但每個故事都充分詮釋了香港美好家庭的核心精神——無論是彌足珍貴的跨代支持與家風傳承，還是小家庭的溫馨日常，抑或是面對逆境時的堅毅同行，都充滿溫度與力量，觸動人心。我們期盼，這些真實的故事能喚起社會對家庭的珍視，讓感恩與擔當成為構建家庭幸福和諧的堅實橋樑。

​​在座每一位都有美滿的家庭。而香港就是我們共同的大家庭。家和萬事興，家庭和睦，不僅是個人幸福的源泉，更是社會繁榮、穩步向前的重要根基。我期待與各位繼續攜手同行，共同增進社會對家庭價值的認同，宣揚優良的家教與家風。

在此我提一個重要日子，今天領獎的日子固然重要，接下來很快有一個很重要的日子，就是十二月七日的立法會選舉。如果大家和我們一樣，都是希望社會能夠充滿關愛，家庭能夠得到支持，希望大家記得屆時用你們重要的一票，發揮家庭的力量，全家總動員參與立法會選舉，選出一個支持香港發展的立法會議員。

最後，祝願在座各位家庭幸福，家和萬事興，多謝大家。"
