記者：你認為今天的球賽如何？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：很好看，氣氛十分好，香港隊亦在主場發揮得更好，勝出球賽就更開心。

記者：第一次在啟德主場館看球賽的氣氛如何？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：我覺得好像在外國看球賽一樣，但更有親切感，因為我們在唱認識的歌，呼喊我們認識的chant（打氣歌），而且沒有看過如此的「一片紅海」，很厲害。

記者：接下來會有更多球賽在啟德舉行？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：一定會，當然這需要問足總（中國香港足球總會），不是由我「話事」。但是，有這麼好的球迷支持及願意入場，我們一定可以有更多球賽在這裏舉行，謝謝。"
香港藝術館新展覽揭幕　首次同場展出香港三大古書畫收藏（附圖）,2025-06-10 20:40,2025-06-10 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000314.htm,"香港藝術館將由六月十一日至十月七日呈獻「香江藏珍──香港三大古書畫收藏」展覽，首次讓三大世界級寶庫—包括由已故本地收藏巨擘劉作籌建立的「虛白齋」、何耀光的「至樂樓」以及利榮森的「北山堂」，同場亮相。展覽精選九十三組橫跨唐代至清代的享譽中外文化的傳世瑰寶，見證香港收藏界的輝煌時代。

展覽由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）主辦、香港藝術館和香港中文大學文物館聯合籌劃。康文署署長陳詠雯今日（六月十日）在展覽開幕典禮上致辭時表示，二十世紀中大量中國書畫及文物珍品輾轉流入香港，外國畫商和收藏家爭相搶購。三位收藏家希望將國粹留在中華大地，竭力搜羅中國歷代書畫珍品，因而創建了虛白齋、至樂樓及北山堂這三批世界級的私人珍藏。他們及其家人更將珍藏饋贈香港藝術館和香港中文大學文物館，作公開展示和教育用途，讓大眾了解鑑賞中國書畫之道。三位藏家及其家族盡心保護和推廣中華文化，彰顯化私為公的高尚情操。

其他主禮嘉賓包括香港中文大學副校長陳德章教授、北山堂基金行政總裁江馨平、博物館諮詢委員會藝術專責委員會主席許焯權教授，以及香港藝術館總館長莫家詠博士。

三大古書畫收藏各具特色。虛白齋藏品涵蓋了明清時期的主要流派，全面而清晰地反映中國書畫藝術傳統發展的脈絡。精選展品包括董其昌的《山水行書合冊》、傳為馬和之所繪的《齊風六篇》、張風的《古木高士圖》和羅聘的《鬼趣圖》等。

至樂樓以「先人品而後藝事」作為其收藏的先決條件，藏品以明末清初的書畫最為豐富。精選展品包括黃道周的《松石圖》、朱耷（八大山人）的《山水冊》、吳彬的《煙江疊嶂圖》和今釋的《行草書詩文冊》等。

北山堂的收藏書畫兼重，涵蓋歷朝，以明清之作居多，當中有孤本罕品，也有名家翰墨。精選展品包括文徵明的《行書寄金陵友人詞》、陶鉉的《幽亭遠岫圖》、王寵的《行書借券》和南宋時期的《庭園雪霽圖》等。

香港藝術館亦邀請了本地藝術家邱榮豐，以三大收藏中明末清初畫家黃向堅《尋親圖》系列中多變的視角及誇張變形的山石造境為啟發，創作兩組藝術裝置作品《迴渡》及《蜃曲》，用當代的角度重新詮釋一個獨特的香港十八區山水故事。

展覽在九龍尖沙咀梳士巴利道十號香港藝術館四樓至樂樓藏中國書畫館、吳冠中藝術廳及靜觀樓藏品廳舉行，免費入場。展覽得到北山堂基金贊助出版展覽圖錄及舉辦國際學術講座系列，邀請海內外專家學者主講，帶領觀眾從深度學術角度欣賞中國古代書畫珍品，了解各地中國書畫的收藏歷史。有關展覽及相關活動詳情，請瀏覽網頁https://hk.art.museum/tc/web/ma/exhibitions-and-events/the-pride-of-hong-kong.html。​

HKMoA's new exhibition unveils and showcases three preeminent collections in Hong Kong for first time (with photos),2025-06-10 20:40,2025-06-10 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000317.htm,"The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) will launch the exhibition ""The Pride of Hong Kong: Three Preeminent Collections of Ancient Paintings and Calligraphies"" from June 11 to October 7, converging for the first time treasures from three world-class collections - Xubaizhai, established by the late renowned local collector Low Chuck-tiew; Chih Lo Lou, by Ho Iu-kwong; and Bei Shan Tang, by Lee Jung-sen, which are highly revered locally and internationally. Ninety-three sets of masterpieces from the Tang to the Qing dynasties will be exhibited, showcasing Hong Kong's golden age of collecting.

The exhibition, presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, is jointly organised by the HKMoA and the Art Museum of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Addressing the opening ceremony held today (June 10), the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan, said that in the mid-20th century, Chinese national treasures were featured in a large quantity in Hong Kong. Foreign art dealers and collectors were highly enthusiastic to acquire these treasures. With the resolve to retain these embodiments of Chinese heritage on home soil, the three collectors were determined to collect ancient Chinese masterpieces. The three world-class private treasured collections, namely Xubaizhai, Chih Lo Lou and Bei Shan Tang, were thus built up. Moreover, the three collectors and their families donated their invaluable collections to the HKMoA and the Art Museum of the CUHK for exhibition and educational purposes, providing the public with the opportunity to appreciate Chinese painting and calligraphy. The three collectors and their families, committed to preserving and promoting Chinese culture, have demonstrated their honourable generosity.

Other officiating guests included Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the CUHK Professor Anthony Chan; the Chief Executive Officer of Bei Shan Tang Foundation, Ms Lillian Kiang; the Chairman of the Art Sub-committee of the Museum Advisory Committee, Professor Desmond Hui; and the Museum Director of the HKMoA, Dr Maria Mok.

The three preeminent collections stand out in distinctiveness. The Xubaizhai Collection covers the major Ming and Qing schools, fully epitomising the development of Chinese painting and calligraphy traditions. Highlight exhibits include Dong Qichang's ""Landscape and Calligraphy in Running Script"", ""Illustrations for the Odes of Qi"" attributed to Ma Hezhi, Zhang Feng's ""Scholar by an Old Tree"" and Luo Pin's ""The Realm of Ghosts"".

The Chih Lo Lou Collection, under the guiding collecting principle of ""artist before his art"", emphasises works from the Ming-Qing transition. Huang Daozhou's ""Pines and Rock"", Zhu Da (Bada Shanren)'s ""Landscapes"", Wu Bin's ""Misty River and Piled Peaks"" and Jinshi's ""Poems and Essays in Running-cursive Script"" are some of the highlight exhibits.

The Bei Shan Tang Collection, rich in both paintings and calligraphies spanning a number of dynasties, especially the Ming and Qing periods, is notable for its leading masters, while some of the works are rare or the only extant pieces by the respective artists. Highlight exhibits include Wen Zhengming's ""Ci-poem for Xu Lin in Running Script"", Tao Xuan's ""Pavilion against Distant Mountains"", and Wang Chong's ""Loan Agreement in Running Script"" and ""Garden after Snow"" during the Southern Song dynasty.

The HKMoA has also invited Hong Kong artist Yau Wing-fung to draw inspiration from the varied perspectives and stylised rocks and mountains in late Ming and early Qing painter Huang Xiangjian's depictions of his reunion journeys in the three preeminent collections, and to create two installations ""To and Fro"" and ""Mirage Harmony"", which retell the unique story of the distinctive landforms of Hong Kong's 18 administrative districts from a contemporary perspective.

The exhibition will be held at the Chih Lo Lou Gallery of Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, the Wu Guanzhong Art Gallery and the Jingguanlou Gallery on the fourth floor of the HKMoA (10 Salisbury Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon). Admission is free. Sponsored by Bei Shan Tang Foundation, the exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue and an international academic lecture series. Scholars from the region and overseas will deliver talks on appreciating Chinese paintings and calligraphy, as well as the history of Chinese art collections in various places. For details of the exhibition and related activities, please visit the website at hk.art.museum/en/web/ma/exhibitions-and-events/the-pride-of-hong-kong.html.

The exhibition is also one of the activities in the Chinese Culture Promotion Series."

​水務署註冊用戶因沒有為懷疑濫收水費個案提供資料罪成,2025-06-10 20:25,2025-06-10 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000567.htm,"水務署公布，一間有限公司因沒有遵從水務監督要求為懷疑濫收水費個案提供有關資料或文件，違反《水務設施規例》第47A條，今日（六月十日）在東區裁判法院承認控罪。該公司為香港鰂魚涌一劏房的水務署註冊用戶。

水務署發言人表示，《2024年水務設施（修訂）條例》（修訂條例）加強水務監督在調查懷疑濫收水費個案時取證和披露資料的權力，要求業主和其代理人等提交租約、水費收據或付款紀錄，沒有遵從要求可被視作違例，一經定罪可處罰款最高10,000元，以及可就罪行持續期間每日另處罰款最高1,000元，預期檢控個案的數量將會增加。修訂條例提高濫收水費的罰款至最高25,000元，從而打擊濫收水費的違法行為。此外，向水務監督提供虛假或具誤導性資料屬犯罪，最高刑罰為罰款25,000元及監禁六個月。

發言人強烈勸諭業主為其劏房租戶申請安裝獨立水錶，以減低違反修訂條例的風險。水務署鼓勵公眾舉報濫收水費的非法行為，以便該署跟進及調查。市民可致電水務署熱線3468 4963或透過WhatsApp專線5665 5517申請為劏房租戶安裝獨立水錶。該署WhatsApp專線亦會處理濫收劏房租戶水費事宜。此外，市民亦可致電水務署客戶諮詢熱線2824 5000舉報濫收劏房租戶水費，接通並選擇語言後，再按「7」字，便可直接向職員舉報。"
WSD-registered consumer convicted of failing to provide relevant information or documents for suspected case of overcharging for water,2025-06-10 20:25,2025-06-10 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000565.htm,"The Water Supplies Department (WSD) announced that alimited company was convicted today (June 10) of failing to comply with the Water Authority's request to provide relevant information or documents for a suspected case of overcharging for water, in contravention of regulation 47A of the Waterworks Regulations. The consumer pleaded guilty to the offence at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. The company is a WSD-registered consumer of a subdivided unit (SDU) in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.

A spokesman for the WSD said that the Waterworks (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 (the amended WWO) has strengthened the power of the Water Authority in evidence collection and information disclosure during the investigation of suspected cases of overcharging for water. The Water Authority can request the landlords, their agents, etc, to provide the tenancy agreement, receipt or payment record for charges for water. Failure to comply with such a request can be an offence, and the offender is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $10,000 and a further fine of up to $1,000 for each day the offence continues. It is anticipated that there will be more prosecution cases. The maximum penalty for overcharging tenants of SDUs for water has been raised to $25,000 to deter this illegal act. Moreover, providing false or misleading information to the Water Authority is also an offence with a maximum penalty of a $25,000 fine and six months' imprisonment.

  The WSD spokesman strongly appealed to landlords to apply for the installation of separate water meters for their SDUs, which can greatly reduce the risk of contravening the amended WWO. The WSD encourages the public to report any illegal act of overcharging SDU tenants for water for follow-up and investigation by the department. The public can call the WSD Hotline 3468 4963 or WhatsApp 5665 5517 to apply for the installation of separate water meters for SDUs. The WhatsApp hotline also handles matters relating to water overcharging in SDUs. Alternatively, the public can call the WSD Customer Enquiry Hotline 2824 5000 to report water overcharge cases. After calling the hotline and choosing a language, they can press ""7"" for reporting to staff directly."

   行動期間，漁護署人員於長洲附近水域發現一艘本地漁船涉嫌非法使用蛇籠（一種已被禁止在香港水域使用的浸籠）捕魚，遂於晚上約九時三十分截停有關船隻進行調查。漁護署其後從船上檢走一批捕魚工具（包括蛇籠和絞轆）。

   漁護署現正從涉嫌以蛇籠捕魚並違反《漁業保護條例》（第171章）的方向，調查船上一名本地船長及六名內地過港漁工。

任何人士在本港水域使用船隻捕魚時，其船隻必須已根據《漁業保護條例》登記及按其本地漁船登記證明書上所列出的捕魚方法捕魚。本地漁船登記證明書有關浸籠部分的登記條件亦指明任何摺疊式浸籠不得以任何方式與另一浸籠連接，或其任何一面伸展後的長度不得超過五米。因此，使用蛇籠捕魚亦屬違法。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款10萬元及監禁六個月。

漁護署發言人強調︰「政府一直致力打擊香港水域的非法捕魚活動，漁護署會繼續加強巡邏和嚴格執法。」"
AFCD investigates Mainland fisherman deckhands and local coxswain suspected of using snake cages for fishing (with photo),2025-06-10 20:05,2025-06-10 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000768.htm," A joint operation was conducted by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) together with the Hong Kong Police Force and Zhuhai Municipal Marine Comprehensive Law Enforcement Team in the southern waters of Hong Kong yesterday (June 9).

  During the operation, the AFCD personnel intercepted a local fishing vessel suspected of engaging in fishing using snake cages (a type of cage trap banned in Hong Kong waters) in waters off Cheung Chau at around 9.30pm for investigation. Some fishing gear (including snake cages and winches) on board was seized by the AFCD.

 The AFCD is investigating a local coxswain and six Mainland fisherman deckhands on board suspected of engaging in fishing using snake cages, in violation of the Fisheries Protection Ordinance (Cap. 171).

 Only a vessel registered under the Ordinance can be used for fishing in Hong Kong waters and only the fishing methods listed on its Certificate of Registration of Local Fishing Vessel can be employed for fishing by the vessel. The conditions of the Certificate of Registration of Local Fishing Vessel regarding cage traps also stipulate that any collapsible cage traps should not be connected in any way to another; or should not exceed five metres in any of its extended dimensions. Hence, it is unlawful to fish using snake cages. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $100,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction.

 A spokesman for the AFCD stressed, ""The Government is committed to combatting illegal fishing activities in Hong Kong waters. The AFCD will continue to step up patrols and take stringent enforcement action."""

由香港房屋委員會（房委會）主辦的「屋邨管理服務承辦商大獎2024」頒獎禮今日（六月十日）在油塘大本型舉行，共頒發90個獎項，表揚過去一年在管理房委會轄下物業有傑出表現的服務承辦商及前線員工。

房委會今年特別增設獎項，嘉許在打擊濫用公屋方面有重大貢獻的傑出前線人員，感謝他們竭力維護寶貴的公屋資源。

  房屋署副署長（屋邨管理）楊耀輝在頒獎禮上表示：「公共房屋是社會的寶貴資源，我們必須善用及合理編配給真正有住屋需要的人士。房委會一直致力打擊濫用公屋行為（『打濫』），我們鼓勵服務承辦商與我們合力維護公屋資源。」

他說：「我們已在服務承辦商評分制度中設立獎勵機制，『打濫』表現良好的服務承辦商會獲額外加分，有助增加投標和中標機會。事實上，服務承辦商前線員工在偵測個案方面給予我們同事的協助，成效十分顯著，讓我們的『打濫』工作取得理想成績。」

  二○二四年度的獎項名單中，共有17間為房委會提供物業管理、清潔、保安和停車場管理服務的承辦商獲獎；另外亦有八名物業服務經理和56名前線員工獲得嘉許。得獎名單詳見附表。

  本年度獲得「最佳公共屋邨（物業服務）大型公共屋邨組別」獎項的承辦商所管理的屋邨分別為天耀（一）及天耀（二）邨、彩園邨、厚德邨和石籬（二）邨；而獲得「最佳公共屋邨（物業服務）小型公共屋邨組別」獎項的承辦商所管理的屋邨則分別為榮昌邨、華貴邨（華愛樓）和龍逸邨。

  現時房委會轄下超過半數公共屋邨的管理工作均外判予物業管理服務承辦商負責，屋邨內很多主要的維修工作亦由服務承辦商負責監督。房委會期望借助私營機構的資源及其管理私人樓宇的經驗，持續提升公共屋邨管理服務水平，為居民提供安全和舒適的居住環境。"

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) hosted the Estate Management Services Contractors Awards (EMSC Awards) 2024 presentation ceremony at Domain in Yau Tong today (June 10). A total of 90 awards were presented to the estate management services contractors and frontline staff in recognition of their outstanding performances in managing the HA's properties last year.

  The HA introduced a new award this year to recognise the significant contributions of outstanding frontline staff on combating tenancy abuse, in appreciation of their efforts in safeguarding this valuable housing resource.

  Officiating at the presentation ceremony, the Deputy Director of Housing (Estate Management), Mr Ricky Yeung, said, ""Public housing resources are precious and should be allocated appropriately and rationally to those in genuine need of housing. The HA has been committed to combating tenancy abuse in public housing. We are encouraging services contractors to collaborate with us in safeguarding these housing resources.

  ""We have implemented a reward mechanism in the service contractor evaluation system, whereby services contractors who perform well in combating tenancy abuse will receive additional points, enhancing their bidding and contracting opportunities. Indeed, the effectiveness of the assistance provided by frontline staff of services contractors to our colleagues in detecting cases has been significant, helping our work in combating tenancy abuse achieve the desired results.""

  The EMSC Awards in 2024 went to 17 services contractors providing property management, cleaning, security and car park operating services. Eight property services managers and 56 frontline staff members were also commended. The full list of awardees is in the Annex.

  The estates managed by the winners of the Best Public Rental Housing Estate (Property Services) Large Estate award this year include Tin Yiu (I) & Tin Yiu (II) Estate, Choi Yuen Estate, Hau Tak Estate and Shek Lei (II) Estate, while the estates managed by the winners of the Best Public Rental Housing Estate (Property Services) Small Estate award include Wing Cheong Estate, Wah Kwai Estate (Wah Oi House) and Lung Yat Estate.

  Currently, the management of more than half of the HA's public rental housing estates is outsourced to property services contractors, and many major maintenance tasks in the HA estates are being supervised by them. By leveraging the private sector's resources and experience in managing private properties, the HA seeks to continuously raise the quality of its estate management services and provide a pleasant living environment for its tenants."

  Three years ago, AALCO's choice to establish its newest regional arbitration centre in Hong Kong reflected AALCO members' resounding confidence in our city's rule of law, legal talent, and many other unique advantages as an international financial centre and legal services and disputes resolution centre under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", and of course, also Hong Kong's location, being the heart of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) development and an important gateway of the Belt and Road Initiative.

  Since its establishment, AALCO Hong Kong has made significant contributions in enhancing Hong Kong's regional arbitration capabilities. By providing a neutral and efficient platform for dispute resolution, AALCO Hong Kong has facilitated the settlement of cross-border commercial disputes, reinforcing confidence in the legal systems of Asian and African economies.

  AALCO Hong Kong has also organised various seminars and training programmes for capacity building of dispute resolution professionals and international collaboration by working closely with governments, arbitral institutions, and legal bodies to harmonise arbitration practices across different jurisdictions, especially in the GBA and the Belt and Road regions. For example, we are very happy to see that AALCO Hong Kong supported the Second Instalment of the 7th Belt and Road Conference hosted by the Law Society of Hong Kong, which featured engaging and fruitful dialogues in promoting a peaceful dispute resolution worldwide.

  I wish to extend my deepest congratulations and gratitude to AALCO, the legal community, and all stakeholders who have supported AALCO Hong Kong's growth. This milestone is not just a proof to AALCO Hong Kong's achievements over the past three years, but also a reflection of Hong Kong's growing role as a leading hub for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. As we look ahead, the demand for arbitration and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services will grow, driven by increasing cross-border trade, Belt and Road Initiative projects, digital economy disputes, and international sports events.

  Let us reaffirm our commitment to advancing the edge of arbitration, promoting ADR, and building a more interconnected legal and dispute resolution landscape for Asia, Africa, and beyond. To conclude, I wish AALCO Hong Kong many more years of success. Thank you."

The event provided deep insights into Hong Kong's latest policy developments including family office policies and tax incentives. The session was well received, drawing participation from over 60 representatives of legal and professional firms serving high-net-worth clients. The event sparked active discussions, with participants expressing keen interest and strong confidence in the evolving role of Hong Kong's professional services sector and the future of Hong Kong's family office ecosystem.

Key topics covered included interpretation of Hong Kong's latest family office policies, comparisons with regional regimes and tax incentives, case studies and a question-and-answer session. The session aimed to enhance understanding among legal and advisory firms of Hong Kong's policy landscape, strengthen participant's positioning as cross-border advisors to ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), and facilitate the development of business networks in Hong Kong.

Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Charles Ng said, ""Hong Kong is the leading hub for asset and wealth management in Asia with over US$4 trillion in assets under management. Our city is recognised as a trusted gateway for global capital seeking access to opportunities across Asia and beyond. Our leadership is further evidenced by our standing as Asia's largest hedge fund hub and Asia's largest cross-border wealth management centre. The professional services sector plays a strategic and indispensable role in enabling this ecosystem to flourish. InvestHK is committed to working closely with legal, accounting, trust, and advisory professionals to promote policy understanding and strengthen Hong Kong's competitiveness in cross-border wealth management and succession planning.""

Legal professionals attending the event provided perspectives on Hong Kong's family office policies and the growing opportunities arising from them. The Chair of the Family Office Committee at the Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Chan Chak-ming, said, ""With increasing interest from UHNWIs in Asia, Hong Kong's forward-looking initiatives, including tax incentives and efficient market processes, solidify its position as the region's leading destination for family offices. Together with InvestHK, we aim to strengthen Hong Kong's role as a nexus for global wealth, ensuring it remains responsive to the sophisticated needs of UHNWIs while reinforcing trust and long-term confidence.""

InvestHK will continue to collaborate with industry stakeholders to support legal and advisory firms in expanding their high-end wealth services in Hong Kong, and to promote the city as a premier hub for family offices and a cross-border wealth management centre in Asia, helping Mainland and international families of UHNWIs achieve long-term goals in asset growth and succession."

Mr Nick Chan (Director of the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre), Deputy Commissioner Mr Fang Jianming (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), heads of AALCO disputes resolution centres, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  A very good afternoon. It is both an honour and a privilege to stand before you today as we mark a significant milestone - the third anniversary of the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre. Over the past three years, AALCO Hong Kong has not only flourished but has also become a cornerstone of Hong Kong's reputation as a world-class destination for international dispute resolution.

Police remind public not to download or provide funding to mobile application endangering national security,2025-06-10 17:59,2025-06-10 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000697.htm,"ÂÂÂ The National Security Department (NSD) of the Hong Kong Police Force reminds the public today (June 10) not to download a mobile application named ""Reversed Front: Bonfire"" or provide funding to the application developer for engaging in acts and activities endangering national security.

ÂÂÂ ""Reversed Front: Bonfire"" was released under the guise of a game with the aim of promoting secessionist agendas such as ""Taiwan independence"" and ""Hong Kong independence"", advocating armed revolution and the overthrow of the fundamental system of the Peopleâs Republic of China established by the Constitution of the Peopleâs Republic of China. It also has an intention to provoke hatred towards the Central Authorities and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Any person or organisation who knowingly publishes the application or related content, including sharing or recommending the application to others via the Internet, may commit the offence of ""incitement to secession"" under Article 21 and the offence of ""incitement to subversion"" under Article 23 of the Hong Kong National Security Law, as well as ""offences in connection with seditious intention"" under Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

ÂÂÂ In addition, those who have downloaded the application may be regarded as in possession of a publication that has a seditious intention. Under Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, a person who, without reasonable excuse, possesses a publication that has a seditious intention, commits an offence. A person who provides pecuniary or other financial assistance or property to the application developer, including making payment through in-app purchases, with an intent to provide funding to the relevant developer for the commission of secession or subversion, also commits an offence.

ÂÂÂ With the approval of the Secretary for Security, NSD has implemented disabling action on electronic messages related to ""Reversed Front: Bonfire"" in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Implementation Rules for Article 43 of the Hong Kong National Security Law.

ÂÂÂ NSD again reminds that acts or activities endangering national security are extremely serious offences. Police will ensure that the law is observed and strictly enforced, and will take resolute actions to bring offenders to account. Members of the public should not download the application or provide funding by any means to the relevant developer. Those who have downloaded the application should uninstall it immediately and must not attempt to defy the law.

二零二五年第一季服務行業按季業務收益指數,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000379.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月十日）發表的業務收益指數的臨時數字顯示，二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第一季比較，不少主要服務行業以價值計算的業務收益均有不同程度的升幅。

二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第一季比較，金融業（銀行除外）（+32.5%）、保險業（+23.1%）、進出口貿易業（+19.4%）及銀行業（+19.0%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，地產業（-6.7%）及零售業（-6.5%）的業務收益指數同期則錄得跌幅。

按服務界別分析，電腦及資訊科技服務界別的業務收益指數同期按年上升60.2%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別的業務收益指數亦按年上升1.1%。

二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第四季比較，不少主要服務行業經季節性調整的業務收益（以價值計算）均錄得不同程度的升幅。當中，保險業（+32.5%）、進出口貿易業（+20.3%）及銀行業（+19.9%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，地產業的業務收益指數同期則下跌5.7%。

按服務界別分析，二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第四季比較，電腦及資訊科技服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數上升50.3%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數亦上升0.7%。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第一季不少服務行業的業務收益較去年同期上升。較顯著的升幅見於金融業（銀行除外）、保險業、進出口貿易業，以及銀行業。

展望未來，經濟增長應為服務行業的業務提供支持。內地經濟繼續增長和香港政府各項增強經濟動能的措施應有利服務行業的業務，儘管一些行業或會受外圍環境的不確定性及市民和旅客於本地市場的消費模式轉變帶來的持續不利因素所影響。

進一步資料

表1載列最近五季選定服務行業及服務界別的業務收益指數及其相應按年變動百分率，而表2則載列最近五季經季節性調整的業務收益指數按季變動百分率。

二零二五年第一季的業務收益指數的修訂數字將於二零二五年七月十八日在政府統計處網站(www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/web_table.html?id=660-69001)發布。

編製業務收益指數所用的數據主要來自政府統計處進行的「服務行業按季統計調查」，並輔以香港金融管理局及香港旅遊發展局提供的有關數據。

服務界別有別於服務行業，前者包括橫跨不同行業但與某個共同主題相關的經濟活動。服務界別可能包括某個服務行業內所有機構單位進行的全部經濟活動，而該服務行業與該服務界別關係密切。然而，在一個與該服務界別關係不太密切的服務行業內，只有部分機構單位甚或只有這些機構單位的部分經濟活動是與該服務界別有關。以旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別為例，這界別包括所有會議展覽機構的服務、短期住宿服務及旅行社所提供的服務，以及食肆、零售商及運輸服務營辦商的部分服務（只包括以旅客為對象的服務）。

服務行業的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各類經濟統計調查，把經濟單位分類歸入合適的行業類別。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《二零二五年第一季服務行業按季業務收益指數》報告內。用戶可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

二零二五年第一季建造工程完成量統計數字,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000354.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月十日）公布「建造工程完成量按季統計調查」的臨時結果。主要承建商於二零二五年第一季所完成的建造工程名義總值的總計為705億元，較上年同期上升1.9%。

剔除價格變動的影響後，臨時結果顯示以實質計算，主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值的總計於同期間輕微下跌0.9%。以實質計算的建造工程完成量總值，是透過適當的物價指數去平減相應的建造工程完成量名義總值至二零零零年基期的價格水平計算而成。

按建造工程類別分析，於二零二五年第一季完成的私人地盤建造工程名義總值為194億元，較上年同期下跌10.7%。以實質計算，跌幅為12.7%。於二零二五年第一季完成的公營地盤建造工程名義總值較上年同期上升17.4%至305億元。以實質計算，升幅為13.8%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第一季所完成的非地盤建造工程名義總值為206億元，較上年同期下跌3.9%。以實質計算，跌幅為5.7%。非地盤建造工程包括小規模新建工程及樓房裝飾、樓宇修葺及保養工程，和非地盤的電器設備安裝及保養工程。

按主要用途類別分析，住宅樓宇建造工程於二零二五年第一季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值為209億元，較上年同期上升5.0%。同期間，運輸工程於二零二五年第一季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值下跌19.4%至88億元。

以經季節性調整的數字按季比較，主要承建商於二零二五年第一季完成的建造工程名義總值較二零二四年第四季輕微上升0.1%。以實質計算，則下跌1.0%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第一季所完成的建造工程總值臨時數字列載於表1。二零二四年全年及第四季的修訂數字則分別列載於表2及表3。

由於分判建造工程在建造業內十分普遍，一間建造業機構可以是某一合約的主要承建商，同時亦可以是另一合約的分判承建商。主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值，只包括該等建造業機構作為主要承建商合約中所完成的建造工程，而不包括其作為分判承建商所完成的建造工程。然而，分判承建商所完成的建造工程總值，應已包括在其受聘的主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值之內。

建造業機構單位的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各經濟統計調查，把經濟單位撥歸不同的行業類別。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for May 2025,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000333.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (June 10) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for May 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 41.2 in April 2025 in the contractionary zone to 42.1 in May 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. June 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.4. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in May 2025 as compared with previous month for many surveyed sectors, particularly for the import and export trades (from 40.2 to 41.9) and wholesale trade (from 40.0 to 41.5).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades increased from 42.0 in April 2025 to 44.0 in May 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month’s time (i.e. June 2025) was 45.8.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month's time saw some improvement in May, as the global trade tensions eased somewhat. The overall employment situation also turned slightly better.

  Looking ahead, the uncertain external environment could continue to affect business sentiment. Nonetheless, the resilient local economy and sustained steady growth in the Mainland economy should provide a solid backstop. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

Quarterly business receipts indices for service industries for first quarter of 2025,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000391.htm,"  Business receipts in value terms of many major service industries showed increases of varying magnitudes in the first quarter of 2025 when compared with the first quarter of 2024, according to the provisional figures of business receipts indices released today (June 10) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  Comparing the first quarter of 2025 with the first quarter of 2024, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the financing (except banking) (+32.5%), insurance (+23.1%), import/export trade (+19.4%) and banking (+19.0%) industries. On the other hand, decreases were recorded in business receipts indices of the real estate (-6.7%) and retail (-6.5%) industries during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 60.2% year-on-year during the same period, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 1.1% year-on-year.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, business receipts in value terms of many major service industries recorded increases of varying magnitudes in the first quarter of 2025 when compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. In particular, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the insurance (+32.5%), import/export trade (+20.3%) and banking (+19.9%) industries. On the other hand, business receipts index of the real estate industry decreased by 5.7% during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, comparing the first quarter of 2025 with the fourth quarter of 2024 on a seasonally adjusted basis, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 50.3%, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 0.7%.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business receipts of many service industries recorded increases in the first quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. More notable increases in business receipts were seen for the financing (except banking), insurance, import/export trade and banking industries.

  Looking ahead, business of the service industries should be supported by economic growth. Continued growth of the Mainland economy and the Hong Kong Government's various measures to boost economic momentum should be conducive to the businesses of the services industries, though some industries may be affected by the continued headwinds stemming from the uncertainties in the external environment and the changing consumption patterns of residents and visitors in the local market.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the business receipts indices and their corresponding year-on-year rates of change in respect of selected service industries and service domains for the recent five quarters, while Table 2 shows the corresponding quarter-to-quarter rates of change in the business receipts indices for the recent five quarters based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The revised figures of business receipts indices for the first quarter of 2025 will be released at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=660-69001) on July 18, 2025.

  Data for compiling the business receipts indices are mainly based on the Quarterly Survey of Service Industries conducted by the C&SD, supplemented by relevant data provided by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

  A service domain differs from a service industry in that it comprises those economic activities which straddle different industries but are somehow related to a common theme. It may include all activities carried out by all establishments in a service industry that is closely related to the domain. For a service industry that is less closely related, however, only a portion of the establishments in the industry or even only part of the economic activities of the establishments is related to the domain. Taking the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain as an example, it includes all services of convention and exhibition organisers, short-term accommodation services and services of travel agents, and some of the services (only those involving visitors as customers) of restaurants, retailers and transport operators.

  The classification of service industries follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into relevant industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""Quarterly Business Receipts Indices for Service Industries, First Quarter 2025"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520).

Construction output for first quarter of 2025,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000355.htm,"  The total gross value of construction works (GVCW) performed by main contractors in the first quarter of 2025 increased by 1.9% in nominal terms over a year earlier to $70.5 billion, according to the provisional results of the Quarterly Survey of Construction Output released today (June 10) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  After discounting the effect of price changes, the provisional results showed that the total GVCW performed by main contractors slightly decreased by 0.9% in real terms over the same period. GVCW in real terms is derived by deflating the corresponding nominal value with an appropriate price index to the price level in the base period of 2000.

  Analysed by type of construction works, the GVCW performed at private sector sites totalled $19.4 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down by 10.7% in nominal terms over a year earlier. In real terms, it decreased by 12.7%. The GVCW performed at public sector sites increased by 17.4% in nominal terms over a year earlier to $30.5 billion in the first quarter of 2025. In real terms, it increased by 13.8%.

  The GVCW performed by main contractors at locations other than construction sites amounted to $20.6 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down by 3.9% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier. In real terms, it decreased by 5.7%. Construction works at locations other than construction sites included minor new construction activities and decoration, repair and maintenance for buildings; and electrical equipment installation and maintenance works at locations other than construction sites.

  Analysed by major end-use group, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of residential buildings projects amounted to $20.9 billion in the first quarter of 2025, up by 5.0% in nominal terms over a year earlier. Over the same period, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of transport projects down by 19.4% in nominal terms to $8.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, the GVCW performed by main contractors slightly increased by 0.1% in nominal terms but decreased by 1.0% in real terms in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the fourth quarter of 2024.

  Table 1 shows the provisional figures on the GVCW performed by main contractors in the first quarter of 2025. Tables 2 and 3 show the revised figures for the whole year of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2024 respectively.

  Owing to the widespread sub-contracting practices in the construction industry, a construction establishment can be a main contractor for one contract and a sub-contractor for another contract at the same time. The GVCW performed by main contractors covers only those projects in which the construction establishment takes the role of a main contractor, but not projects in which it takes only the role of a sub-contractor. However, sub-contractors' contribution to projects should have been included in the GVCW performed by main contractors for whom they worked.

  The classification of construction establishments follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on the Quarterly Survey of Construction Output"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1090002&scode=330).

二零二五年五月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000328.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月十日）發表二零二五年五月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年四月在收縮區域的41.2上升至二零二五年五月的42.1，而未來一個月（即二零二五年六月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.4。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但不少統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年五月較上月上升，特別是進出口貿易業（從40.2上升至41.9）及批發業（從40.0上升至41.5）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年四月的42.0上升至二零二五年五月的44.0，而未來一個月（即二零二五年六月）的新訂單展望動向指數為45.8。

評論

政府發言人表示，隨着環球貿易摩擦略見緩和，五月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均有所改善。整體就業情況亦略為好轉。

展望未來，外圍環境的不確定性會繼續影響營商氣氛。然而，本地經濟表現強韌，內地經濟持續穩步增長，應可提供有力支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

環境及生態局局長在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會會議就休閒漁農業開場發言（只有中文）,2025-06-10 15:36,2025-06-10 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000533.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（六月十日）下午在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會會議，就休閒漁農業的開場發言：

多謝主席、各位委員。

我們今日向委員簡介推動發展休閒漁農業的各項措施的最新進展，以及政府向業界提供的支援。

政府正積極推動《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》下的各項措施，以協助業界升級轉型，邁向現代化、集約化和可持續發展，當中包括推動休閒漁農業發展。

在休閒農業方面，漁護署（漁農自然護理署）自二○二四年六月起推出了「農＋樂」農場計劃，協助主要從事商業農耕的農場提供休閒活動作為輔助業務，並在二○二五年四月進一步放寬計劃下的安排。

在休閒漁業方面，我們現時有休閒垂釣魚排，也有內陸休閒魚場。為進一步推動休閒漁業發展，漁護署計劃在今年第三季推出「漁＋樂」魚場計劃。參加計劃的魚排／內陸魚場可提供的休閒輔助活動，除了休閒垂釣外，也包括售賣自家養殖的漁產品，售賣以無火煮食方式製作以自家漁產品為主的菜式，以及舉辦與漁業教育有關的活動等。另外，為協助捕撈漁民轉型發展休閒漁業，漁護署與海事處亦正探討允許漁船作一船兩用的可行性，並會適時諮詢持份者。

今日我們在此作階段性匯報，我們會繼續透過創造有利條件，包括在法例法規方面拆牆鬆綁，為漁農民提供培訓、財政和技術支援，以及加強宣傳推廣，以協助業界發展休閒漁農業。

接下來，我請漁護署助理署長朱振華博士用投影片介紹討論文件。隨後歡迎各委員提問。多謝各位。"
​運輸及物流局局長出席中電源動香港首次液化天然氣加注及貨物同步裝卸慶祝典禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-06-10 15:05,2025-06-10 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000490.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（六月十日）出席中電源動香港首次液化天然氣加注及貨物同步裝卸慶祝典禮的致辭全文：

蔣東強先生（中電控股首席執行官）、吳局長（廣州市商務局副局長吳偉華）、各位立法會議員、中電和航運界的朋友：

今日大家在此濟濟一堂，我衷心再次多謝中電源動特別為這次活動舉辦一個正式典禮，我很高興聯同我的團隊一同參加。正如剛才蔣先生提到，特區政府推出《綠色船用燃料加注行動綱領》（《行動綱領》）後，得到很多業界的支持和響應。

今年二月十四日的情人節，我很記得這個日子，我們首次在海上錨地完成了海上液化天然氣（LNG）加注，給予大家信心。我記得當日的天氣有一些不能預計的情況，但都能成功完成，為大家打了一支強心針。

上周在貨櫃碼頭進行首次液化天然氣加注和貨物裝卸同步作業，當時我與Frankie（立法會議員易志明）和Horace（現代貨箱碼頭集團董事總經理盧偉民）身在重慶，為大家爭貨源、拼出路、拼市場。我其實很想能夠親身參與，雖然未能身在現場，但都很關心，知道整個過程都非常順暢。我會用日子去讓我更容易記着這件事，當天是六月五日，是中國曆法廿四節氣的芒種，就讓我班門弄斧說一說，「時雨及芒種，四野皆插秧」，中電源動可能因應天氣預告而選擇了一個好日子，這詞語的意思是在當日收成第一波農作物，又為夏天來臨而陸續播種做準備，充分體現你們在六月五日的加注作業已收成了第一票貨，為往後的插秧產生了好好的啓發作用。

剛才蔣先生提到，香港作為國際航運中心，我們在船用燃料加注方面，成績非常卓越，今次活動，我們一方面為船隻卸貨，另一方面進行新能源加注，充分體現一加一大於二的協同效應。香港在加注船用燃料方面是粵港澳大灣區區內第一位、全國第二位，以及全球第七大傳統船用燃料的加注中心。這個成績其實是得來不易，我們在傳統船用燃料加注方面有一個很好的基礎，往後要打拼的是新能源加注，為減低碳排放而在航運和物流方面達至ESG（環境、社會及管治），為國際班輪公司和貨主提供綠色航運的一個選擇和方案。香港將會成為國際班輪公司、貨主和市場在綠色燃料加注、交易和同步卸貨的不二之選。

我們正非常努力地朝三個方向──包括數字化、綠色化和智慧化──去提升香港作為國際航運中心的地位，也需要業界的鼎力支持，團結一致。中電源動今次正起了一個帶領作用，統籌今次整個行動，亦有中海油（中國海洋石油）作為供應商，可見香港雖然在新能源生產或供應方面未必有相關的天然資源，但我們可以作為超級聯繫人，匯聚不同的企業，在香港產生一個蓬勃的生態圈和供應鏈。我也不是空口說白話，自我們頒布《行動綱領》後，我們的團隊和相關立法會議員與環境及生態局一直都有一些工作小組，最近也看到成績，有不少企業都有興趣，希望有一個匯聚平台，做一些企業聯繫，做成一個生態圈，以起超級聯繫人的作用。我的團隊正非常努力，相信在今個月稍後會有一些活動和儀式，到時再有好消息與大家分享，讓香港和內地相輔相成產生一個效果。

最後，我希望透過這活動和大家的廣泛宣傳，包括中電源動、中海油和現代貨箱碼頭有限公司，我們一定要踏出勇敢的第一步，用更響亮的公關宣傳方法向國際說好香港故事。香港有非常優厚的優勢，有很強的底氣，我有信心與大家攜手合作，政府願意繼續擔當一個帶領和引導的角色，在其他燃料方面，不單是液化天然氣，還有綠色甲醇和氫氣，我們今年內都會有一些實質的工作進展跟大家分享，亦希望得到大家的回饋和回報，讓我們航運中心的業務蒸蒸日上。多謝大家！"
食安中心公布第二次總膳食研究有關硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽的結果,2025-06-10 15:00,2025-06-10 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025060900503.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（六月十日）公布香港第二次總膳食研究的第二份報告。該報告就食物中的硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽含量，以及相關的膳食攝入量進行研究。結果顯示，本港整體成年人口和較年輕群組從膳食攝入硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽的分量，分別處於每日可攝入量參考範圍內和低於每日可攝入量，對一般市民的健康構成即時風險或影響的機會不大。

硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽在環境中普遍存在，亦可於動物和人體內產生。它們也會被用作食物添加劑作防腐和護色用途。硝酸鹽天然存在於植物性食物，通常以葉菜的含量最高，人類主要透過進食蔬菜攝入硝酸鹽；而亞硝酸鹽則主要來自硝酸鹽在體內轉化而成。

中心發言人說，硝酸鹽本身沒有毒性，但可被口腔中的細菌轉化為亞硝酸鹽。亞硝酸鹽可令血液中的血紅蛋白氧化成正鐵血紅蛋白，從而降低血液攜帶氧氣的能力。此外，亞硝酸鹽亦可能促成N-亞硝基化合物的形成，而部分此類化合物具有致癌性。然而，若從正常膳食中的蔬菜攝入硝酸鹽，蔬菜中的維他命C等其他生物活性物質或有助抑制內源形成N-亞硝基化合物。

根據歐洲食物安全局的評估，硝酸鹽的每日可攝入量參考範圍為每公斤體重1.05至9.4毫克。至於亞硝酸鹽，聯合國糧食及農業組織／世界衞生組織食物添加劑聯合專家委員會和歐洲食物安全局訂定的每日可攝入量同為每公斤體重0.07毫克。

這次研究共檢測187種食物的硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽含量，其中百分之九十七檢出硝酸鹽，百分之三十二檢出亞硝酸鹽。「蔬菜及蔬菜製品」在全部食物組別中的硝酸鹽平均含量最高，每公斤達690毫克。攝入量一般的成年人口和較年輕群組從膳食攝入的硝酸鹽絕大多數來自該食物組別，佔硝酸鹽總膳食攝入量約九成，其中單是葉菜已佔七至八成。至於亞硝酸鹽，青豆角的平均含量最高（每公斤12毫克），其次是蔬果汁、蘿蔔糕、芥蘭、椰菜和西瓜，為每公斤6.4至9.9毫克。

根據研究結果，攝入量一般和攝入量高的成年人每日從膳食攝入硝酸鹽的分量分別為每公斤體重3.8毫克和8.0毫克；較年輕群組的攝入量則分別為每公斤體重4.1毫克和8.9毫克。至於亞硝酸鹽，攝入量一般和攝入量高的成年人每日從膳食攝入亞硝酸鹽的分量分別為每公斤體重0.014至0.018毫克和0.025至0.029毫克；較年輕群組的亞硝酸鹽攝入量則分別為每公斤體重0.019至0.025毫克和每公斤體重0.038至0.045毫克。

發言人提醒市民應保持均衡飲食，每日進食最少三份蔬菜和兩份水果，並在膳食中加入更多種類的蔬菜，包括花菜、果菜、瓜菜及菇菌等。市民亦應妥善貯存和處理蔬菜，例如貯存非即時食用或出售的蔬菜在雪櫃内，烹煮前徹底清洗、按情況去皮，或以沸水烹煮代替炒菜，以減少蔬菜的硝酸鹽含量和亞硝酸鹽的形成。

香港第二次總膳食研究評估香港市民和不同人口組別從膳食攝入一些可能有潛在食物安全風險的化學物質的分量，以及評估攝入該些物質對健康帶來的風險。整項研究由二○二三年二月開始進行，預計於二○二六年年底前完成，有關其他化學物質組別的研究報告會分期公布及上載中心網頁www.cfs.gov.hk。"
CFS announces Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study findings on nitrate and nitrite,2025-06-10 15:00,2025-06-10 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025060900506.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department released the second report under the Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study today (June 10). This report examined the levels of nitrate and nitrite in food, and the associated dietary exposure. The findings showed that the dietary exposure to nitrate and nitrite among the overall adult and younger populations in Hong Kong fell within the alternative range of Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) values and below the ADI respectively, indicating the general population is unlikely to experience any immediate health risks or effects.

Nitrate and nitrite are ubiquitous in the environment and can be produced endogenously in animals and humans. They are also used as food additives for preservative and colour retention purposes. Nitrate is found naturally in plant-based foods, with the highest concentrations typically found in leafy vegetables. Human exposure to nitrate mainly comes from consumption of vegetables, while exposure to nitrite mostly results from endogenous conversion from nitrate.

A spokesman for the CFS said that nitrate itself is relatively non-toxic, but it can be converted into nitrite by bacteria in the mouth. Nitrite can oxidise haemoglobin into methaemoglobin in the blood, reducing its oxygen-carrying capacity. Nitrite may also contribute to the formation of N-nitroso compounds, some of which are carcinogenic. However, when nitrate is consumed through a normal diet containing vegetables, other bioactive substances in vegetables, such as vitamin C, may inhibit the endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds.

According to an evaluation conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the alternative range of ADI values estimated for nitrate is 1.05 to 9.4 milligrams/kilogram body weight (bw)/day. The Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives and the EFSA established the same ADI for nitrite, which is 0.07mg/kg bw/day.

Out of a total of 187 food items tested for nitrate and nitrite levels in the Study, nitrate was detected in 97 per cent of the items, while 32 per cent were found to contain nitrite. Among all food groups, ""Vegetables and their products"" had the highest mean concentration of nitrate, at 690mg/kg. For average consumers of the adult and younger populations, the vast majority of dietary sources of nitrate came from this food group, accounting for about 90 per cent of the total dietary exposure to nitrate. Among these, leafy vegetables alone contributed 70 to 80 per cent of the total daily nitrate exposure. As for nitrite, green string beans were detected with the highest mean concentration of nitrite (12mg/kg), followed by fruit and/or vegetable juice, turnip cake, Chinese kale, European variety cabbage and watermelon, with mean concentrations ranging from 6.4 to 9.9mg/kg.

According to the findings, the estimated dietary exposure to nitrate was 3.8 and 8.0mg/kg bw/day for average and high consumers of the adult population respectively. For the younger population, the estimated dietary exposure to nitrate was 4.1 and 8.9mg/kg bw/day for average and high consumers respectively. Regarding nitrite, the estimated dietary exposure was 0.014 to 0.018mg/kg bw/day and 0.025 to 0.029mg/kg bw/day for average and high consumers of the adult population respectively. For the younger population, the estimated dietary exposure to nitrite was 0.019 to 0.025mg/kg bw/day and 0.038 to 0.045mg/kg bw/day for average and high consumers respectively.

The spokesman reminded members of the public to maintain a balanced diet, consume at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruits every day and incorporate a greater variety of vegetables into their diet, including flowerhead brassica vegetables, fruiting vegetables, mushrooms and fungus. The public is also advised to store and prepare vegetables properly to reduce nitrate levels and minimise nitrite formation. For example, keep vegetables under refrigeration if not consumed or sold immediately, wash vegetables thoroughly and peel them as appropriate before cooking, or boil vegetables in water rather than stir-fry.

The Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study aims to estimate the latest dietary exposure of the Hong Kong population and various population subgroups to some chemical substances of potential food safety concern, and assess the associated health risks. The Study commenced in February 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. The reports of other groups of chemical substances will be released in phases and uploaded to the CFS webpage at www.cfs.gov.hk."

行政長官於行政會議前會見傳媒開場發言及答問內容（附短片）,2025-06-10 13:15,2025-06-10 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000389.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（六月十日）上午出席行政會議前會見傳媒的開場發言及答問內容：

行政長官：大家早晨。我宣布二○二五年《施政報告》將會於九月公布。公眾諮詢將會在下星期一，即六月十六日，正式展開。我今年較過往提前於九月發表《施政報告》，是因為今年年底會舉行立法會換屆選舉，今屆立法會會期會提早結束。提前展開今年《施政報告》的公眾諮詢，是因為我重視行政立法溝通和互動的重要性，同時讓政府有充份的時間聽取市民和社會各界的意見和建議。

我上任近三年，努力改變政府文化，建立以結果為目標的政府，推動政府工作步伐加快，主動做事。我和團隊願意聽取社會意見，令我們的措施更對接市民的需求。

去年發表的第三份《施政報告》，在不同範疇推出了共600多項政策措施，深化我上任以來的各項改革。各項措施正不斷推展，在守正創新、求進求變的同時，進一步提升和發揮香港的成功元素。

百年未見的大變局正加速演進，地緣政治錯綜複雜，保護主義、單邊主義抬頭，貿易秩序受到破壞，供應鏈受到威脅。香港面對不同挑戰，但有危亦有機。香港的機遇始終大於挑戰，香港在「一國兩制」下同時享有國家機遇和國際機遇，而國家的不斷發展更是香港的最大機遇和最強後盾。

香港經濟仍然正面擴張，今年的生產總值估計有百分之二至三的正增長。同時香港正進入經濟轉型期，有些行業會表現不錯，有些行業會面對挑戰，政府和各行業都要識變、應變、求變。我們要通過創新創造，發掘新增長點，開拓新市場、新藍海，深化國際交往合作，做大做深區域合作，全力拼經濟，謀發展，改善民生。

我和團隊將出席超過40場線上線下的諮詢會和兩場地區諮詢會，廣泛聽取不同人士的意見，包括專業界別、地區組織、政黨、不同市民等。我們會走進社區，親身接觸不同階層，聽取他們的想法。

另外，三個星期後的七月一日，就是香港回歸祖國暨特區成立二十八周年的大日子。特區政府會在全港18區舉辦百多項慶祝活動，包括升旗禮、步操匯演、嘉年華、綜藝晚會、球類比賽等多項項目。

政府和不同行業亦會推出多元化的優惠，讓巿民與親友歡渡這個喜慶日子。

第一，公共交通優惠：

＊港鐵在七月一日會以抽獎形式送出71 000張電子車票，中獎市民半年內可以任選日子，免費乘搭一程指定路線的本地車程。當日，機場快線3至11歲小童免費，60歲或以上市民半價乘搭。

＊七一當日，市民可免費乘搭天星小輪來往尖沙咀和灣仔，以及用免費乘船券乘搭五條新渡輪和富裕小輪的航線。

＊市民更可以由七月一日起連續三日免費乘搭電車。

第二，多個政府場地免費及海洋公園等提供優惠：

＊康樂及文化事務署多項室內和戶外康樂設施、科學館及太空館的常設展覽、香港濕地公園、西九文化區M+標準票的所有展覽，以及香港故宮文化博物館所有專題展覽，在七月一日全部一律免費開放。

＊香港海洋公園推出成人門票優惠，在七月三日或之前到香港海洋公園，二人同行八折，三至四人同行七折。

＊由七月一日至七日，在「本地魚菜直送」網店或手機app（應用程式）購買魚類統營處和蔬菜統營處特定產品，有七一折。

＊七月一日到環境保護署「綠在區區」回收，「綠綠賞」積分雙倍。

＊今年有更多企業推出七一優惠，包括多間商場、百貨公司、國貨公司，連同香港國際機場、香港科學園、數碼港商場等，提供一系列購物、餐飲、消費或泊車優惠。

＊在六月底至八月，香港旅遊發展局與多個商戶合作，推出餐飲、購物、景點、旅遊和娛樂優惠，讓市民和遊客玩得盡興。

政府今日稍後會公布各項優惠和活動的詳情，相關部門和機構亦會繼續更新相關資訊。

我感謝社會各界積極響應，為市民提供不同優惠和多元慶祝活動。我鼓勵並相信更多機構會參與其中，讓整個香港和市民共同熱烈慶祝香港回歸祖國二十八周年的大日子。多謝大家。

記者：特首，你好。第一，想問食肆等場所牌照的新規定，即是作出不利國安或者香港公眾利益的冒犯行為會被「釘牌」。想請問如何定義？做法是否針對所謂的「黃店」？以及想問問是否如湯家驊所說，用粗口罵領導人或者國家就會可能被「釘牌」？如果食肆貼「香港加油」，或者諷刺政府的字眼其實又是否可以呢？第二，消息說夏寶龍主任今個月會訪港，想問特首知否是哪一日到來？來多少天？知否夏寶龍今次訪港目的是甚麼？會否督促特區提速改革，尤其是北部都會區的發展？多謝。

行政長官：食環署在新簽發及續期牌照時加入有關維護國家安全的條款，防範和制止不利國家安全的行為，是履行維護國家安全的法律責任和義務，是恰當亦應該的。

根據《中華人民共和國憲法》，所有公民有義務維護國家安全。香港作為中國特區，市民有義務維護國家安全。根據《香港國安法》，香港行政機關有責任維護國家安全。

根據《維護國家安全條例》（《條例》），任何機構，組織和個人，都應當遵守特區維護國家安全所適用的法律。根據《條例》第8條，凡特區法律授予某人任何職能，任何人在作出執行該職能上的任何決定時，須將國家安全視為最重要的因素，並據此給予適當考慮。即是食環署按《條例》的第8條，香港的法律給予食環署職能，食環署人員在行使其職能作任何決定時，應該將國家安全視為最重要的元素而適當考慮。

所以有關的條款，已經在新增持牌條件中清楚解釋，食環署在處理新牌照或續牌申請時，會依法行事。有關條款亦在食環署的場地租約及簽發的牌照中，包括年宵攤檔和公眾娛樂場所等適用。

安全是一切發展的基石，所以我們會繼續不斷完善維護國家安全的法律和執行機制。至於在條文中提及的冒犯行為，在條款中已清晰闡釋。冒犯行為是任何構成或者導致危害國家安全的罪行，又或不利於國家安全和香港公眾利益的一些行為或者活動，是很清晰的。

另外，有關中央港澳辦、國務院港澳辦主任夏寶龍先生，他對於香港的所有事情都非常關心，而且他亦很重視去了解香港不同方面的實際情況，所以他曾經兩次來到香港調研考察，包括在二○二三年和二○二四年，每一次我都陪伴夏主任在調研考察接觸不同市民、不同人士代表等。所得出的結果都是相當好，第一，社會反應很正面；第二，夏主任表示他更加了解香港的實際情況，亦通過直接與不同代表溝通對話，掌握到大家對整體香港社會發展的一些感覺和意見。

夏主任關心香港，如果有甚麼信息關於夏主任在香港的活動，我們會適時發放，到時大家就會知道實際情況會是如何。多謝。

記者：你好，特首。想問《施政報告》方面，今年的主題會聚焦甚麼？跟以往有甚麼不同？過去一年，你定下138個KPI（關鍵績效指標），目前進度如何？是否已經全部完成？或者會否有機會在新一份《施政報告》提點某一位司局長盡快完成工作？另一方面問網約車和的士業界的爭議，有的士業界認為，如果政府願意以每個牌照500萬收回的士牌，就可以解決網約車規管的爭議，政府是否同意？或者會否真的考慮收回所有的士牌？謝謝。

行政長官：我每年都會在《施政報告》定下不同指標，不同部門在這些KPI下的表現均符合我的要求。我亦不斷檢視每個部門在訂下的指標內的工作進度。在公布《施政報告》時，我會整體向大家報告這方面的情況。目前來說，部門是達標的。

我多次強調，現時政府的施政方針是拼經濟、謀發展、改善民生，所以《施政報告》的範圍一定是朝着這三方面。《施政報告》亦會重點考慮如何強化香港一些既有優勢，如何把握好機遇，還有如何處理風險。整體來說，我上任後已經在多方面進行改革。在深化改革方面，我是重視的。在諮詢過程中，我全方位歡迎任何人在不同領域提供意見，因為《施政報告》所涵蓋的範圍都是市民和社會關心的問題，所以我希望在所有不同範圍都聽取意見。市民亦無須從我的角度考慮我的重點。如果你有考慮，我很感謝，你可以在重點方面提供意見，但市民自身有何想法、意見和需求，我亦很希望聽取他們的意見。我過去的經驗是，經過不同的諮詢會，特別是兩場地區諮詢會跟市民直接交流，亦會在落區時聽市民意見，都有一個很好的互動和交流，這個我們會努力做。我們整個團隊都很樂意聽取不同意見。

另外，有關的士的問題，我留意到相關報道。動用任何公帑，必須極度謹慎。市民對於的士服務未達要求，有很多聲音，有很多意見，的士業界必須重視。的士牌照給予的士經營特權，包括專為的士而設的的士站，只供的士使用；的士亦可以到達指定禁區接載乘客，也可隨時接載「街客」上車。這些是牌照長期容許的士使用的特權，令牌照有直接回報，亦令的士長期在經營下獲利。

的士服務同樣有社會價值，在改善服務的大前提下，的士應該繼續存在，但網約車是世界趨勢，而且這個趨勢在一些城市或地區，網約車已發展得相當成熟，我相信亦是一個不能逆轉的趨勢。因此，政府考慮利用法律方法，設立法律框架，立法規管網約平台，提供網約的士和其他點對點車輛的合法合規服務，同時保障乘客安全，亦讓的士更好發展，尤其是鼓勵車隊在網約平台的發展，提升的士管理，從而提升的士服務。法例亦會明確訂明甚麼點對點車輛屬違法，運輸及物流局已經馬不停蹄、盡快研究這方面的所有細節，最後會公布細節。我們希望屆時不論社會還是立法會都會充分討論，幫助我們在這方面完善法律，規管網約車，令無論是網約的士或其他點對點網約車輛服務均在合法、保障乘客安全的情況下進行。多謝大家。

Remarks by CE at media session before ExCo (with video),2025-06-10 13:15,2025-06-10 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000388.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at a media session before the Executive Council meeting today (June 10):

Reporter: Good morning Mr Lee. So you have chaired a senior meeting and instructed officials to follow up in response to the fresh water supply to housing estates in Fanling. What do you think the Government can learn from this incident, and are there any areas that should be improved on? And secondly, with Aristo Sham being the first Hong Kong-born pianist to win the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, what does his win mean, in your opinion, and are there any plans to take this opportunity, perhaps, to review support to the industry? Thank you.

Chief Executive: In dealing with water matters, we have to ensure not just that it is safe to drink, but also that people drink it with their mind at ease. I'm highly concerned about the water matter in Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court, and that is why I held a meeting and gave four directives and 10 tasks for the relevant bureaux and departments to implement. I repeat the four directives: to trace the source; to set up an expert group to assist in the tracing; to immediately install and strengthen the filtration facilities in each and every building in Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court; and to speed up the work.

 In regard to the 10 tasks, I don't want to repeat here, because they have been well announced. And I've also asked the Deputy Financial Secretary, Michael Wong, to oversee the implementation. I see the 10 specific tasks are being implemented fast and immediately. During the past weekend, colleagues deployed additional manpower on-site to speed up the work progress. The latest progress of key areas has received positive feedback from residents. For example, we have visited a lot of households that have previously made complaints about the water quality, and from them –and from the sample water we've collected – they've indicated that they no longer see any particles in the water. They find the water clean, and they feel at ease to drink the water.

 We have also enhanced manpower at the district level to talk to people who may still have problems. This includes government officials, care teams, District Council members and the different representatives who are willing to join the government team to visit households and also talk to the different people to address their concerns. And I'm glad to hear that they have been receiving positive feedback that those who previously complained about the particles they have reported, they no longer see those particles. There may be one or two households that still reported that they had seen particles, but after flushing and some work to the taps and also cleaning the water meter, there is very clear improvement. We'll continue the work. Experience suggests that some particles or residue may remain in the pipes after entering into the building. In other words, in the same building, we're seeing a lot of households saying the water is clean – they don't see any particles anymore – but there may be one or two that still see some small particles. So these particles stay in internal pipes, probably within the households or probably within the taps or the water meter. Government colleagues are working hard to do all they can to continue to flush the pipes, flush the tap, flush the water meter. And I advise residents, they can do the same, but we'll do our best. And what is also very important is good dissemination of information, and we have been publishing the results every day on the website, and also posting the notice at the entrance of all buildings.

 I think the experience that colleagues have learned from this incident is, response should be fast. We should understand the feelings of residents in water concerns to ensure that it's not just safe, but that when they drink the water, their mind is at ease. Colleagues, of course, focus on the technical side of ensuring the water is safe. I think everybody handling this matter knows that we should, at the same time, address residents' ease of mind when we deal with water problem. And I've also instructed the Water Supplies Department to replace the pipes which are the source of the particles. They're working hard on it. My thanks to the support and advice of the expert team which has been formed, they are more or less formulating the plan to replace the pipes which are the source of the problem as soon as possible, and the Water Supplies Department will submit the plan to the Development Bureau as soon as possible.

 As regards the very good news of Aristo Sham having won the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, which is one of the highest levels of piano competitions, and Mr Aristo Sham, being born in Hong Kong – we are so proud of him, and we are so glad that he has won the competition. I think every Hong Kong resident feels proud of this excellent result. And of course, if Aristo will find time to make a few performances in Hong Kong, it will really get us even more excited and we will see if that will happen, but we'll work hard to see whether we can make it happen.

 I'm very glad that overall, the performances of a lot of artists from Hong Kong are doing well in different areas, and this is seen in a lot of good results they have achieved. The present mechanism for the Government to support performers in this field of art is through the Hong Kong Arts Development Council, and they will be looking closely at the needs to strengthen opportunities for different areas of art so as to develop talent, to develop the overall performances of those who are interested in different areas. There is an expert group, actually, in the Arts Development Council to look at the overall situation and the different areas, strengths and potentials, to examine assistance and support, including donations or subsidies in the area of developing different arts. So the mechanism is there and we will continue to make good use of the Arts Development Council to help artists in different areas to achieve their goals and realise their dreams. Thank you.

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-06-10 11:31,2025-06-10 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000334.htm,"âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.

Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.

The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.

A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.

Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.

The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."
"Three property owners fined over $410,000 in total for not complying with statutory orders",2025-06-10 11:00,2025-06-10 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000261.htm,"âThree property owners were convicted and fined over $410,000 in total by the court earlier for failing to comply with statutory orders issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

The first case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 50 square metres on the roof of a village house in D.D.183, Sha Tin. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the unauthorised building works (UBWs) and the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD and was fined $128,300 in total, of which $108,300 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, upon conviction at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts on June 4.

The second case involved two unauthorised structures with a total area of about 102 square metres on the flat roof of a residential building at Tsing Chui Path, Tuen Mun. As the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the BD, a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted twice by the BD and was fined $22,760 in total upon conviction by the court. As the owner persisted in not complying with the removal order, the BD instigated the third prosecution in 2023. The owner was convicted and fined $197,500 in total by the Court, of which $97,500 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, upon conviction at the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts on June 4.

The third case involved alteration works at a composite building on Prince Edward Road West, Kowloon, including removal of two fire rated doors on the eighth floor and at the yard on the ground floor respectively, and a door opening formed in the wall of the yard on the ground floor. The alteration works affected the fire resisting construction of the building and contravened the Building (Construction) Regulation. A removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD and was fined $85,060 in total, of which $81,060 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, upon conviction at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts on May 21.

A spokesman for the BD said today (June 10), ""Unauthorised building works, including unauthorised alterations affecting the fire-resisting construction of a building, may lead to serious consequences. The owners concerned must comply with the statutory orders issued by the BD without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with statutory orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

Hospitals under the HA have long provided patients and their families or carers with a loan service of assistive devices, such as wheelchairs, canes and walking frames to support patients in their daily routine and rehabilitation during recovery. While this service is undoubtedly beneficial to the public and worthy of support, available information indicates that the borrowing and returning procedures are rather cumbersome and overly stringent. For example, when a device is returned, the deposit payer must present the deposit receipt to collect the refund in person at the hospital; authorising a representative is not acceptable. Moreover, without the receipt, a refund will be denied even if the deposit payer visits the hospital in person and provides proof of the device's proper return.

Mr Chan said, ""Assistive devices are essential to facilitating the early recovery and daily lives of patients with needs, and alleviating the burden on families and carers. The Office has noted that the HA's current loan arrangements may cause varying degrees of inconvenience to patients and their families and carers. Given the significant number of borrowers and a deposit as high as $3,500 for each assistive device, denying refunds due to missing receipts would not only lead to conflicts, but also imposes a financial burden on patients and their families. In this light, I have decided to launch a full investigation into the HA's current procedures and mechanisms for assistive device loan services to identify any areas for improvement. Pertinent recommendations will be made for the benefit and convenience of the public.""

The Ombudsman welcomes views from members of the public on this topic. Written submissions should reach the Office of The Ombudsman by July 10, 2025:

申訴專員全面調查醫院管理局的借用輔助器材服務（附圖）,2025-06-10 11:00,2025-06-10 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000285.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（六月十日）宣布展開全面調查，詳細審研現時醫院管理局（醫管局）向市民提供借用輔助器材服務的程序和機制。

醫管局轄下各醫院一直有向病人及其家屬或照顧者等人士提供借用輔助器材（如輪椅、手杖及步行架等）服務，以協助病人在康復進程期間進行日常活動及復康治療。這服務確實有利市民，值得支持。然而，有資料顯示，醫管局就市民借用及歸還輔助器材的手續頗為繁複及過於嚴謹，例如要求借用人在歸還器材時，必須由按金繳款人帶同按金收據親身到醫院領回按金，其他人不能代領；而按金繳款人即使親往醫院並出示器材已完好歸還的證明書，如未能出示按金收據，仍不會獲退回按金。

陳積志表示：「輔助器材對有需要的病人早日康復和日常生活至為重要，相關器材亦可減輕家人和照顧者的負擔。公署留意到，醫管局現行借用輔助器材的安排或會對病人、家人及照顧者造成不同程度的不便。由於借用輔助器材的人士眾多，而每件輔助器材按金金額可高達3,500元，如因未能出示按金收據而不獲退回按金，容易引發衝突，亦會對病人及家屬等造成經濟負擔。因此，我決定展開這項全面調查，詳細審研現時醫管局的借用輔助器材服務的程序和機制，以及探討當中有否改善空間，提出適切改善建議，做到真正利民便民。」

申訴專員歡迎市民以書面提出意見。請於二○二五年七月十日或之前把意見送達申訴專員公署：

第一宗個案涉及沙田丈量約份第183地段一幢村屋天台上一個面積約50平方米的僭建物。由於有關僭建物不會獲地政總署發出豁免證明書，而有關僭建物並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署遂根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向有關業主發出清拆令。該名業主沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控，並於上周（六月四日）在沙田裁判法院被定罪及判罰款共十二萬八千三百元，當中十萬八千三百元屬就罪行持續的日數所判的罰款。

第二宗個䅁涉及屯門青翠徑一幢住宅大廈平台上的兩個面積合共約102平方米的僭建物。該些僭建物並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署遂根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向有關業主發出清拆令。該名業主沒有履行清拆令，故曾兩次遭屋宇署檢控，並被法庭定罪及判罰款合共兩萬兩千七百六十元。由於該業主仍不履行清拆令，屋宇署於二○二三年提出第三次檢控。該名業主於上周（六月四日）在屯門裁判法院再次被定罪及判罰款共十九萬七千五百元，當中九萬七千五百元屬就罪行持續的日數所判的罰款。

第三宗個䅁涉及九龍太子道西一幢商住大廈的改建工程，包括拆除分別位於八字樓及地下天井的兩道防火門，以及在地下天井的牆身開鑿一個門口。該些改建工程影響樓宇的耐火結構，違反《建築物（建造）規例》。屋宇署遂根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向有關業主發出清拆令。該名業主沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控，並於上月二十一日在九龍城裁判法院被定罪及判罰款八萬五千零六十元，當中八萬一千零六十元屬就罪行持續的日數所判的罰款。

屋宇署發言人今日（六月十日）說：「僭建物（包括影響樓宇的耐火結構的違例改建）可導致嚴重後果，有關業主必須盡快遵從法定命令。對於未有遵從法定命令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款二十萬元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款二萬元。"

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.
