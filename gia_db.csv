CFS instructs trade to suspend import of ByHeart powdered infant formula with possible contamination of Clostridium botulinum,2025-11-20 22:37,2025-11-20 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000833.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (November 20) said that, in view of the latest announcement by the manufacturer of ByHeart powdered infant formula yesterday (November 19) that Clostridium botulinum was found in unopened cans of ByHeart powdered infant formula, while no affected products were available for sale in Hong Kong, the CFS has immediately implemented precautionary measures and instructed the trade to suspend import of the relevant ByHeart powdered infant formula.

The CFS, through its Food Incident Surveillance System, noted notices issued by the Food and Drug Administration of the United State (US) earlier that ByHeart powdered infant formula is being voluntarily recalled due to possible contamination with Clostridium botulinum. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed up with major local importers and retailers. Investigation found that the affected products had not been put on sale in Hong Kong. Earlier the CFS has also published food incident post to remind the public and the trade.

Product details of the affected powdered infant formula are as follows:

Product names:
(1) ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans
(2) ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula Anywhere Pack™
Brand: ByHeart
Place of origin: US
Batch: All batches and packages

The spokesman said, ""Although the US manufacturer concerned has initiated a recall of the affected products, for the sake of prudence, the CFS urges travellers to immediately stop consuming the affected products if they have bought any of them.""

Infant botulism is caused by the ingestion of the Clostridium botulinum spores that germinate and grow in the intestine of infants and release toxin. A very small amount of toxin can cause illness. The onset of symptoms generally follows a period of normal development. Early symptom is constipation, followed by poor feeding, lethargy, weakness, pooled oral secretions, and wail or altered cry. Loss of head control is striking. Infant botulism ranges from mild illness with gradual onset to sudden infant death. While most cases require hospitalisation, fatal cases are rare (case fatality rate less than 1 per cent).

""The CFS has contacted the US authorities over the incident and will continue to closely monitor information issued by the relevant authorities and take appropriate action. Follow-up work is ongoing,"" the spokesman said."

中心早前透過食物事故監測系統，得悉美國食品藥物管理局發出通告，指ByHeart嬰兒配方奶粉可能受肉毒桿菌污染而進行自願回收。中心得悉事件後，已即時聯絡本地主要進口商和零售商跟進。調查顯示受影響產品沒有在本港出售，中心早前亦已發布食物事故報表，提醒公眾和業界。

受影響嬰兒配方奶粉的產品資料如下：

產品名稱：
（一）ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans
（二）ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula Anywhere Pack™
品牌：ByHeart
原產地：美國
批次：所有批次及包裝

發言人說：「雖然有關的美國製造商已在當地回收受影響產品，但為審慎起見，中心呼籲外遊的市民如曾購入有關產品，應立即停止食用。」

嬰兒肉毒中毒是由嬰兒攝入肉毒桿菌孢子所致，這些孢子在其腸道內發芽和生長，繼而釋出毒素致病。極微量的毒素已足以引致肉毒中毒。嬰兒發病前身體仍有一段時間發育正常，至病徵出現時早期是便秘，繼而出現餵哺困難、無精打彩、虛弱無力、口腔分泌物增多，以及哭聲微弱，最明顯的是無法控制頭部。嬰兒肉毒中毒起初可能病情輕微，但隨着病情進展，可致猝死。雖然大部分患者均需接受住院治療，但致命的情況較罕見（死亡率不足百分之一）。

發言人說：「中心已就事件聯絡美國當局，並會繼續密切留意有關當局發出的相關消息及採取適當跟進行動。跟進工作仍然繼續。」"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-20 20:47,2025-11-20 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000720.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 20),the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
------------------------------
 The case involves a 63-year-old male living in Kwai Tsing District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Shenzhen in Guangdong on October 29. He developed a fever in mid-November, and presented with joint pain and rash yesterday (November 19). He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital on the same day, and admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

 The patient has one household contact, who travelled with him to Shenzhen. She is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 As the patient has visited CF-affected areas for travel about two weeks before the onset, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 65 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

In light of the local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of the patient's residence to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 950 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past five days. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus. The operating hours of the booth will be adjusted based on actual needs. Please refer to the CHP'swebpagefor the actual operating hours of the health consultation booth.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-20 20:47,2025-11-20 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000719.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————
個案涉及一名63歲男子，住所位於葵青區。初步調查顯示，他於十月二十九日到訪廣東省深圳市。他於十一月中旬出現發燒，並於昨日（十一月十九日）出現關節痛及皮疹，同日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

病人的一名家居接觸者曾與他一同到深圳市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於個案在病發前約兩星期曾前往受基孔肯雅熱影響的地方旅遊，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————
本港今年累計錄得65宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應一宗涉及一名住在筲箕灣東熹苑的68歲女子的本地個案，中心呼籲該名患者居所一帶居民，如於十月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和東區關愛隊已向東熹苑一帶受影響地區約3 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的資料單張及問卷，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於筲箕灣興東商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於東熹苑進行上門探訪，為逾4 950名市民進行評估，過去五日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為四名早前出現輕微病徵的市民進行抽血檢查，全部對基孔肯雅病毒的檢測為陰性。醫護站的運作時間會因應實際需要而調整，確實時間請參閱中心網站。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Hospital Authority appeals to public for patient requiring urgent heart transplant,2025-11-20 20:22,2025-11-20 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000253.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) made the following appeal today (November 20) regarding a patient who requires an urgent heart transplant:

A male patient currently hospitalised at Queen Elizabeth Hospital is in critical condition, requiring an urgent heart transplant. The transplant team from Hong Kong West Cluster and the clinical team at Queen Elizabeth Hospital are proactively following up on the patient's emergency situation. The HA appeals to members of the public to proactively support organ donations and consider donating the heart of a deceased relative to rekindle the lives of others.

In view of the critical condition of the patient, in addition to proactively searching for a suitable heart locally, the HA will also initiate procedures to seek assistance from the Mainland as soon as possible. When a patient who is willing to donate an organ is deceased and no suitable patient is identified to receive the organ on the Mainland, the cross-boundary organ donation and matching mechanism will facilitate a transplant in Hong Kong to bring hope to a critically ill patient.

The spokesperson emphasised that when a suitable heart is found, the HA will strictly follow the relevant organ transplant regulations and make an application with the authorities to ensure that all procedures comply with relevant standards and regulatory requirements. The HA will arrange a transplant operation with the aim of saving the patient's life as soon as possible.

For critically ill patients with an organ failure, an organ transplant is often the only hope to extend their lives. When deceased patients and their families make a selfless decision to donate deceased organs for patients in need of an organ transplant, it not only gives critically ill patients the hope of life but also eases hardship in their families. The HA appeals to the public to pass on great love, blessings and care to those who are still fighting for their well-deserved lives."
醫院管理局就一名急需換心病人作出呼籲,2025-11-20 20:21,2025-11-20 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000251.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（十一月二十日）就一名急需換心病人作以下呼籲：

一名急需換心的男病人，現時在伊利沙伯醫院留醫，情況危殆。港島西醫院聯網的移植團隊及伊利沙伯醫院的臨床團隊正積極跟進病人的緊急情況，呼籲市民踴躍支持器官捐贈，積極考慮捐出離世親人的心臟，遺愛人間，延續大愛。

鑑於有關病人情況十分危急，醫管局除了積極在本地為病人尋找合適心臟外，亦將盡快通過相關程序向內地尋求幫助。當內地覓得願意捐贈器官的病人離世後，而在當地沒有合適病人接受作移植，可協調跨境捐贈器官至香港作配對移植，為危急病人帶來重生希望。

發言人強調，當尋獲合適的心臟時，醫管局將嚴格按照相關的器官移植法規，從速向監管機構作出申請，確保所有程序符合有關標準及法規要求，並會盡快安排移植手術，為病人帶來重生的希望。

對於器官衰竭的危急病人，器官移植往往是他們延續生命的唯一希望。當離世病人及家屬施予無私大愛，捐出遺體器官以救助性命垂危的病人，不僅給予危急病人重生的希望，更讓病人家屬在艱難中得以解困。醫管局呼籲市民，發揮大愛與關懷精神，讓愛承傳，為正在奮力求生的病人送上祝福和重生的希望。"
CHP strongly urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as three severe paediatric influenza infection cases were recorded this week,2025-11-20 20:00,2025-11-20 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000691.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 20) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case, marking the third case this week. The CHP strongly urged parents to arrange for their children to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 14-year-old boy with good past health. He developed cough and headache on November 18, followed by a fever yesterday (November 19). He was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital today. Due to hypotension,he was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unitof United Christian Hospital. He is hosptialised and currently in serious condition. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with shock.

The boy had not yet received the 2025/26 SIV and had no recent travel history. Two of his household contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms recently, but did not require hospitalisation and have recovered. No influenza outbreaks have been reported at his school recently.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 21 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including two fatal cases. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years. A total of 12 cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity began to decline in the last week of October. However, it remains at a relatively high level. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, at nearly 16 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."
一周三宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心強烈呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-20 19:45,2025-11-20 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000673.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十日）再接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，是本周第三宗。中心強烈呼籲家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的14歲男童。他於十一月十八日出現咳嗽及頭痛，昨日（十一月十九日）出現發燒，今日被帶到將軍澳醫院急症室求醫，因血壓過低被送往基督教聯合醫院的兒童深切治療部留醫，目前情況嚴重。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H3）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克。

男童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗，近期不曾外遊。他其中兩名家居接觸者近日曾出現呼吸道病徵，病況輕微，無需住院，現已康復。他就讀的學校近日沒有爆發流感。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得21宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括兩宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的12宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度在十月最後一周開始回落，但仍然處於較高水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近16%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

行政長官在遼寧省香港商會十一週年慶典晚宴致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-11-20 19:30,2025-11-20 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000506.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十一月二十日）在遼寧省香港商會十一週年慶典晚宴的視像致辭：

張立會長（遼寧省香港商會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。很高興通過視頻參與今天的慶典晚宴。我首先祝願遼寧省香港商會繼往開來，續創輝煌。

遼寧，是東北的經貿樞紐、工業重鎮；香港，是國際金融、航運、貿易中心。兩地南北相望，人緣相親，經貿往來密切。香港是遼寧的主要外商投資來源地之一。截至去年底，港商在遼寧投資總額，累計超過1,160億美元，位居全省首位，充分體現兩地優勢互補、互惠共贏，攜手貢獻國家高質量發展。

上月，二十屆四中全會在北京勝利閉幕。全會審議通過《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》，指出要加快高水平科技自立自強，引領發展新質生產力，推動科技創新和產業創新深度融合，一體推進教育科技人才發展。

科技是國家強盛之基，創新是民族進步之魂。遼寧正加快建設區域科技創新中心，引領產業創新。香港正全力建設國際創新科技中心，加速新型工業化，匯聚國際高端人才。遼港兩地發展優勢互補，可以繼續共同把握「十五五」規劃的機遇，深化合作，共創繁榮，為建設科技強國貢獻更大力量。

拼船出海，共乘東風起航。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色。我在新一份《施政報告》中提出成立內地企業出海專班，主動招攬內地企業，並向他們提供多方面支援，通過香港平台服務企業出海。我歡迎更多遼寧和內地企業，以香港作為跳板，開拓國際市場，共謀發展、共拓商機。

香港正加快中醫藥發展，服務國家推動中醫藥國際化。其中，香港中醫醫院和政府中藥檢測中心永久大樓，將於下個月開始投入服務，為香港中西醫協作服務注入動能。商會今天在瀋陽舉辦遼港中醫藥產業合作交流會，正好為我們對接國家產業發展提供重要的交流平台。

遼寧省香港商會自成立以來，一直通過舉辦不同活動，凝聚在遼港商，推廣香港優勢，促進遼港合作。我相信商會將繼續發揮橋樑作用，推動遼港交流，為兩地協同發展注入新動力、開創新機遇。

同樣需要大家同心參與的，是十二月七日的立法會換屆選舉投票日，關係到香港經濟發展和民生改善。在遼港人港商，一直是愛國愛港的重要力量，我呼籲商會全力支持立法會換屆選舉，並鼓勵家人友好踴躍回港投票，選出有能力、有熱誠、有擔當的立法會議員，共建更美好的香港。

最後，我祝願遼港兩地百業興旺、商會會務昌隆、在座各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

各位傳媒朋友，各位香港市民，大家下午好。今天十一月二十日對創新科技及工業局來說是個重要的日子。十年前的今天，特區政府正式成立了創新及科技局，也就是今天的創新科技及工業局的前身。十年來，特區政府與社會各界共同努力，應該說香港目前創科已經有一個蓬勃的發展，在創科及工業局成立十周年的日子裏，我想在這裏向過去所有在創科及工業局工作的同事，以及一直關心香港創科發展的各界人士表示衷心的感謝。我們選擇今天這樣一個重要的日子來發表《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》。就如同一年前的十一月二十日，我們也是在這個日子發表了河套香港園區發展綱要。這也充分顯示了這份綱要對於未來香港創科以及高質量發展的重要性。

大家知道新田科技城屬於北部都會區發展下四大區域的創新科技地帶。新田一帶的創新用地總共有210公頃，連同河套港深創科園，也就是河套香港園區的87公頃用地，是香港「南金融、北創科」新戰略布局的關鍵組成部分。創新科技及工業局早前聘請顧問為新田210公頃創科用地進行創科產業規劃研究，為局方制定這份《概念綱要》提供重要基礎。今天的記者招待會我和我的兩位同事會向大家簡單介紹一下綱要的內容。

政府今日公布的《概念綱要》，提綱挈領地闡述新田科技城的發展願景與定位、產業空間布局，以及發展模式，可以說是為新田科技城訂下清晰的發展方向。經匯聚相關業界人士及持份者的意見，包括創科業界、學術機構、商會、創科協會等，為新田科技城訂定願景、目標和定位。


願景：成為國家「引進來、走出去」的重要創科樞紐、香港未來新興科技產業發展的重鎮，以及發展新質生產力的重要基地。
目標：作為河套地區的天然延伸，新田一帶新創科用地可與大灣區內地城市完整的產業供應鏈相配合，承接河套香港園區的科研成果轉化並進行產業化，繼而推動經濟增長，創造優質就業機會，實現產業結構升級。
定位：（一）提供原型和中試、小規模量產空間，（二）發展本地優質創科產業，以及（三）匯聚全球創科資源和人才。


新田科技城具有三大優勢，它毗鄰香港園區，與福田和皇崗的創科生態緊密對接，具有區位優勢。它提供成片新創科土地，可滿足不同產業鏈環節，不同規模企業，不同科技領域的空間需求，具有規模優勢。此外，它享有優越的交通網絡，鄰近深圳，亦鄰近三寶樹濕地保育公園，具有優良生態環境和宜居的優勢。通過聚焦產業、人才和空間之間的互動，打造以產優城、以城引人、以人築產的良性循環。新田科技城將會以落馬洲為中心，右方為河套香港園區向東至古洞方向推進。左方為新田科技城向西往三寶樹方向推進。

就用地布局而言，新田科技城創科用地會以三個樞紐、三個產業發展帶（三紐、三帶）劃分和發展，也就是由北至南，由河套樞紐、洲頭樞紐及麒麟樞紐，以及生命健康科技發展帶、人工智能與機械人發展帶及微電子與先進產業發展帶。這項規劃結構結合創科產業布局節奏和相關收地和工務部門土地平整工程時間表，劃分為五個發展階段，從導入、產業生態延展、產城中樞，以至完善階段。在推展每一期發展時，發展樞紐作為一個核心起到統籌引領的作用，以核心為中間，我們會開始布局相關產業帶，並強調產城融合，除了引進企業成立總部、打造商業綜合體，並設有人才公寓空間，為創科人才提供各項城市配套。規劃上也會結合實際情況，並預留一定發展彈性，比如在南面麒麟樞紐附近，我們會提供戰略留白區域。

以下介紹產業分布，將聚焦以先進製造為核心的香港創科產業體系的建設，包括六大領域：


生命健康科技
人工智能與機械人
微電子與智能設備
新材料
新能源
綠色科技


新田科技城面積龐大，由明年開始會分五個階段逐步推展，會由河套、洲頭樞紐開始，逐步向西推展至三寶樹一帶。此外，麒麟樞紐附近會作為最後一期，將會作為戰略留白區。 開發模式方面應考慮四個要素：


加快開發速度
平衡戰略發展和財務回報
堅持以產業導向為原則
保障統籌發展一致性


遵循有為政府、高效市場的原則，我們會考慮以成立專屬公司，也可以稱作平台公司，以此模式與市場共同參與開發，公司可以以個別地塊或項目，以合適的開發模式聯同合適的合作方，利用市場化資源提升開發速度、優化開發成本。公司可設立雙層或多層架構，平衡長期戰略發展目標的同時，利用市場化資源提升開發速度、優化開發成本。

就經濟影響評估而言，根據顧問機構的估算，在新田科技城完全運作時，預計每年可為香港本地生產總值帶來約2,500億元的貢獻。同時，提供超過30萬個全職工作崗位。

以上就是我們就新田科技城產業發展的概念規劃，向大家做一個簡要的介紹。「十四五」規劃及「十五五」規劃建議均明確支持香港建設國際創新科技中心，香港會緊密對接國家的發展戰略，加速建設國際創新科技中心，我們期望透過新田科技城提供的新創科用地，為策略性科技企業，特別是有意落戶香港的海內外企業，提供一個優質創科用地的選項，建立相關產業的研發及設計中心、中試轉化基地，以及量產設施，形成蓬勃的創科產業鏈，為加快發展新質生產力、實現香港新型工業化提供有力支撐，助力香港發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，利用香港內聯外通的獨特優勢，助力企業「引進來、走出去」，推動香港創新科技產業邁向高附加值及全球化的重要平台，以及內地創科企業開拓國際市場的首選出外跳板。我的簡要匯報就到此結束，下面歡迎各位媒體朋友的提問。"

"DH introduces tiered and streamlined mechanism to expedite registration of proprietary Chinese medicines, helping businesses tap into global markets",2025-11-20 18:42,2025-11-20 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000624.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) announced today (November 20) that, starting from January 1, 2026, it will launch a pilot programme to streamline the evaluation and approval process for proprietary Chinese medicines (pCm) registration applications. Along with the existing processing procedures, two new tiers will be introduced, namely ""Innovative Drugs"" and ""Designated Priority Products"", with specified target processing times. The new arrangement aims to expedite processing of registration applications under these new tiers, and allow applicants to plan their business and resources more effectively. This initiative aligns with the policy of developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub.

""Enterprises in Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland holding a wholesaler or manufacturer licence in pCm, issued by the Chinese Medicines Board (CMB) under the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong (CMCHK), may leverage the new mechanism to quickly bring suitable pCm products to the Hong Kong market. The DH will evaluate ""Innovative Drugs"" within 120 working days and submit them to the Chinese Medicines Committee (the Committee) under the CMB for approval. Furthermore, applicants may designate up to two products annually as ""Designated Priority Products"". The DH will complete the evaluations for these products within 150 working days and submit them to the CMB for approval. Compared to the current average processing time, which takes over 250 working days, the new mechanism will significantly accelerate the process and enable the industry to select products to test the market response, establish product positioning and use Hong Kong as a springboard to tap into global markets,"" the Assistant Director of Health (Chinese Medicine), Dr Edmund Fong, said.

Applicants may refer to ""Frequently Asked Questions 5.B.25"" on the CMCHK website for details regarding the definitions of each tier, target processing times, and requirements for supplementary documents during the approval stages.

To help the industry better understand the new mechanism, the DH has notified licensed pCm wholesalers and manufacturers via letters in mid-November. Online seminars detailing the mechanism will be held monthly from now until January next year. Interested parties may visit the CMCHK website for details.

The new mechanism will be piloted for two years. The CMB will continuously review its operation and effectiveness, making timely adjustments for optimisation."

化學檢測包括獸藥殘餘、金屬雜質、較常用於醃製食品的防腐劑，以及製作過程可能使用的其他食物添加劑和不准添加於食物的染色料；營養成分測試則檢測樣本的能量、碳水化合物、蛋白質、總脂肪、飽和脂肪酸、反式脂肪酸、鈉和糖等含量，與其營養標籤上的標示值是否相符。

發言人說：「臘味含有硝酸鹽及亞硝酸鹽，亞硝胺亦帶來潛在風險，部分臘味的鈉、糖和脂肪含量也較高，市民須注意均衡飲食，不宜過量進食臘味。嬰兒較易出現亞硝酸鹽中毒，所以不宜食用臘味，小孩也不宜多吃。」

「此外，世界衞生組織轄下的國際癌症研究機構已將加工肉類歸類為『令人類致癌』（即第1組）。市民應避免進食過量加工肉類，以減低患大腸癌的風險。」

發言人亦呼籲業界遵守有關法例規定，並依從優良製造規範，適當地使用法例准許的食物添加劑。零售商應向可靠的供應商採購食物，並遵從《食物安全條例》的要求，保存良好的紀錄，以便在有需要時追查食物來源。"
CFS announces test results of seasonal food surveillance project on lap-mei (with photo),2025-11-20 17:55,2025-11-20 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000273.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (November 20) announced the test results of a recently completed seasonal food surveillance project on lap-mei. The test results of all 164 samples collected were satisfactory.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""Lap-mei is popular in winter and the CFS has therefore collected a variety of lap-mei samples including Chinese pork sausages, Chinese liver sausages, preserved duck meat and preserved pork from different retailers including online retailers for chemical tests and nutrition content analyses.""

Chemical tests targeted veterinary drug residues, metallic contaminants, preservatives usually found in preserved food, as well as other food additives that may be used in the production process and colouring matters that are not permitted in food. For nutrition content analyses, the contents of energy, carbohydrates, protein, total fat, saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, sodium and sugars of the samples were tested to check if they were consistent with their declared values on the nutrition label.

""Members of the public should maintain a balanced diet and avoid excessive consumption of lap-mei in view of its nitrate/nitrite level and potential risk of nitrosamine, as well as the relatively higher sodium, sugar and fat content in some lap-mei. Infants are highly susceptible to nitrite toxicity and should avoid consuming lap-mei, while for young children, the intake of lap-mei should also be restricted.
â
""Furthermore, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization has classified processed meat as 'carcinogenic to humans' (Group 1). The public should avoid excessive consumption of processed meat to reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer,"" the spokesman said.

The spokesman also called on the trade to comply with the legal requirements, follow good manufacturing practices and use permitted food additives in an appropriate manner. Retailers should source food from reliable suppliers and maintain a good recording system in accordance with the Food Safety Ordinance to allow source tracing if needed."

In view of a spate of fatal and serious work accidents in the construction industry earlier, Mr Hui said that contractors and employers should not prioritise progress over safety and shall conduct task-specific risk assessments prior to the commencement of high-risk operations, with safe work methods formulated and implemented. Employees should also co-operate with contractors and employers by following safe work methods and using appropriate personal protective equipment. They shall not neglect the importance of protecting their own and others' safety for the sake of convenience. Building a strong safety culture through industry collaboration is essential for reducing accidents.

Mr Hui added that concerted efforts of all parties concerned, including the Government, various stakeholders and LegCo Members, are needed to formulate appropriate measures for the improvement of construction safety. He appealed to contractors, employers and workers to cast their votes in the 2025 LegCo General Election to elect new LegCo Members who are responsible, ambitious and capable.

Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in October 2025 was 1.0%, the same as that in September 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of increase in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending October 2025 was 0.1%, and that for the 3-month period ending September 2025 was 0.2%. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of increase were both 0.1%.

  Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.4%, 1.1% and 1.0% respectively in October 2025, as compared to 1.5%, 0.9% and 0.8% respectively in September 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending October 2025, the average monthly rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. The corresponding rates of increase for the 3-month period ending September 2025 were 0.3%, 0.2% and 0.2% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of increase in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending October 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% respectively, and the corresponding rates of increase for the 3-month period ending September 2025 were all 0.1%.

  On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in October 2025 for clothing and footwear (-4.7%), durable goods (-3.3%), and electricity, gas and water (-0.3%).

  Taking the first 10 months of 2025 together, the Composite CPI rose by 1.5% over a year earlier. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.0%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively.

The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed low in October. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.0% over a year earlier, same as the increase in the preceding month. Price pressures on various major components continued to be in check.

  Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay muted in the near term, as domestic cost pressures are mild and external price pressures are subdued.

   Mr Chan said, ""At this critical juncture where we are fully committed to boosting the economy and driving development, it is all the more important for the community to stay united and harness a stronger and broader force to propel Hong Kong forward. Positive and constructive interaction between the executive and the legislature will enable us to achieve faster and better development. Every vote cast is a vital force in building a better Hong Kong.

  Mr Lam stated, ""Every single vote is crucial for determining the future direction of governance, economic development, and the well-being of the people. It is also a vital force driving the continuous progress of society. I urge colleagues to vote and also bring along their families and friends to vote in order to create a better Hong Kong.""

  Following the visit by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, to departmental colleagues last week, the three Secretaries of Departments have visited various government departments to appeal to civil servants to vote in the LegCo Election, underscoring their emphasis on the civil service team.

   Mr Chan said, ""At this critical juncture where we are fully committed to boosting the economy and driving development, it is all the more important for the community to stay united and harness a stronger and broader force to propel Hong Kong forward. Positive and constructive interaction between the executive and the legislature will enable us to achieve faster and better development. Every vote cast is a vital force in building a better Hong Kong. I appeal to all residents, including civil service colleagues, to actively participate in the upcoming election and to elect capable, aspiring and visionary candidates to work hand in hand with the Government in promoting the city's development.""

  Mr Lam stated, ""Every single vote is crucial for determining the future direction of governance, economic development, and the well-being of the people. It is also a vital force driving the continuous progress of society. I urge colleagues to vote and also bring along their families and friends to vote in order to create a better Hong Kong.""

  Following the visit by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, to departmental colleagues last week, the three Secretaries of Departments have visited various government departments to appeal to civil servants to vote in the LegCo Election, underscoring their emphasis on the civil service team.

  Mrs Yeung said, ""After a month of promotion and departmental visits, the message for civil servants to vote together has been clearly conveyed among civil servants. I have also felt from the feedback of colleagues that they deeply recognise the importance of voting for the future and development of Hong Kong. Now is the time to understand the platforms of the candidates in your relevant constituency/constituencies, and the next step is to take concrete action by voting to fulfil your civic responsibilities.""

政務司副司長出席香港都會大學中國現代文學館暨「相知無遠近： 張愛玲與宋淇、宋鄺文美的跨地半生緣」展覽開幕典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-11-20 15:13,2025-11-20 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000265.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（十一月二十日）出席香港都會大學中國現代文學館暨「相知無遠近：張愛玲與宋淇、宋鄺文美的跨地半生緣」展覽開幕典禮的致辭：

林群聲校長（香港都會大學校長）、宋以朗博士（張愛玲遺產管理人）、宋元琳女士（張愛玲遺產管理人）、鄺志良教授（香港都會大學副校長（行政及機構發展））、各位嘉賓、各位來自五湖四海的朋友：

大家好！今天，我很高興跟大家一起見證香港都會大學中國現代文學館暨「相知無遠近：張愛玲與宋淇、宋鄺文美的跨地半生緣」展覽的開幕。

首先，我感謝香港都會大學（都大）對政府推動專上教育發展的鼎力支持。從成立初期的遙距教育院校，逐漸發展成為一所全面綜合型大學，以至去年成為香港首間應用科學大學，以公開進修方式為市民提供高等教育機會。今天開幕的中國現代文學館及專題展覽，充分體現都大對培養學習風氣、提高知識水平和加強學術研究的理念和堅持。我期望文學館可以為都大進一步發展其藝術、文化及創意產業專精範疇打下堅固基礎，為建設香港成為中外文化藝術交流中心發揮積極貢獻。

張愛玲是中國當代文學的重要人物。她作品繁多，包括小說、中短篇小說、散文、劇本等，部分如《傾城之戀》、《半生緣》、《金鎖記》、《第一爐香》、《紅玫瑰與白玫瑰》、《色，戒》等，更被改編為電影及舞台劇。張愛玲的作品有強烈個人風格。她的小說揉合現代主義和現實主義。她觀察力極強，對女性心理和男女感情了解透徹，善於以細膩、帶調侃自嘲的筆觸，刻劃出人生的矛盾和衝突。她對色彩、線條、質地、服裝十分敏感，常利用這方面的細膩描寫及冷峻的語言風格，建構她的文學世界。她的作品既有濃濃的上海風情，但也跨越中西文化界線，是時代的見證，令讀者產生強烈的共鳴。她筆下的女角，無論是《金鎖記》的曹七巧、《傾城之戀》的白流蘇、《第一爐香》的葛薇龍及《半生緣》的顧曼楨、顧曼璐，都是性格鮮明的女性，令人印象深刻。中國文學評論家夏志清在一九六一年出版的《中國現代小說史》中對張愛玲推崇備至，說她是「今日中國最優秀最重要的作家」，之後「張學」大行其道，張愛玲被稱為「祖師奶奶」，成為一時佳話。

張愛玲與香港頗有淵源。她一生中曾三度到訪香港。第一次是在一九三九至一九四二年，張愛玲來港於香港大學文學院修讀中文和英文，因戰事被迫中斷學業返回上海。她親歷戰火洗禮的感受和體會，成為了她的寫作靈感，創作出《傾城之戀》、《心經》、《燼餘錄》等經典作品，在上海文壇迅速走紅。第二次是一九五二至一九五五年，張愛玲從上海前來香港，留港三年期間因翻譯海明威初發表的《老人與海》中篇小說，結識了終身摯友宋淇和宋鄺文美夫婦。第三次是在一九六一年重訪香港探索創作素材，住在我們都熟悉的旺角花墟，但因在美國的丈夫中風，幾個月後在一九六二年便回到美國。張愛玲在香港居住的時間雖然只有數年，但卻在香港結下一生中重要和長久的情誼：一九九五年去世後，其遺囑將所有遺物留予宋淇夫婦處理，便足見這段友情之深厚。

張愛玲很喜歡香港。在散文《重訪邊城》中，她直白表達了對香港的熱愛，稱「太喜歡這個城市，兼有西湖山水的緊湊，與青島的整潔」。喜愛張愛玲作品的讀者都一定知道，香港大學、西營盤高街、淺水灣酒店等地方，都在她筆下活靈活現地呈現出來。

今次都大獲得的捐贈，包含1萬7千件張愛玲的遺物，涵蓋張愛玲作品手稿、個人照片、與宋淇和宋鄺文美夫婦等人往來的書信等，是華語世界最大型的張愛玲展覽館藏。在此，我感謝張愛玲遺產管理人宋以朗博士和他姊姊宋元琳女士——也就是宋淇和宋鄺文美夫婦的子女——的慷慨捐贈，為香港帶來了非常珍貴的文學財產，讓大家可以更深入窺探張愛玲的創作歷程、個人生活及思想，和進一步了解她對華語文學的貢獻。我亦多謝都大的團隊，利用數碼科技將張愛玲和宋淇夫婦相知相交的情況，美好地展現出來。

剛才校長講到「無處不旅遊」，但際此時刻，香港是「無處不選舉」。第八屆立法會的換屆選舉將在十二月七日舉行。我呼籲大家積極參與投票，選出有能力、有幹勁、有擔當的立法會議員，以促進香港的社會經濟發展，為香港創造更美好的未來！多謝大家。"

政府公布《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》,2025-11-20 13:50,2025-11-20 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000366.htm,"政府今日（十一月二十日）公布《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》（《概念綱要》），從頂層設計新田科技城210公頃新創科用地的發展願景、目標與定位、產業空間布局，以及發展模式，為新田科技城訂下清晰的發展方略。

創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授表示：「新田科技城佔地廣，開發需時亦需有序。《概念綱要》按土地的供應時間表，提出分階段發展的方案、產業定位和布局、各片區的統籌發展等事宜，以及引導市場資源投入發展的策略，作為清晰的指引，讓新田科技城打造成為創科產業的戰略基地。」

「新田科技城具有三大優勢：它毗鄰河套香港園區，與福田和皇崗的創科生態圈緊密對接，具有區位優勢。它提供約210公頃新創科土地，可滿足不同產業鏈環節，不同規模企業，不同科技領域的空間需求，具有規模優勢。它享有優越的交通網絡，鄰近深圳，亦鄰近三寶樹濕地保育公園，具有優良生態環境和宜居的優勢。」

「作為河套地區的天然延伸，新田一帶新創科用地可與粵港澳大灣區內地城市完整的產業供應鏈相結合，並承接河套香港園區的科研成果轉化並進行產業化，繼而推動經濟增長，創造優質就業機會，實現產業結構升級，通過聚焦產業、人才和空間之間的互動，打造以產優城、以城引人、以人築產的良性循環。」

創新科技及工業局委託顧問進行研究，經匯聚相關業界人士及持份者的意見，包括創科企業、學術機構、商會、創科協會等，為新田科技城訂下三大發展定位：（一）提供原型和中試、小規模量產空間，（二）發展本地優質創科產業，以及（三）匯聚全球創科資源和人才。

就產業發展而言，新田科技城可提供較大規模土地，支援《香港創新科技發展藍圖》提出的策略性創科產業發展，即生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人、微電子與智能設備、新材料、新能源及綠色科技等，並聚焦以先進製造為核心的香港創科產業體系的建設。

就用地布局而言，新田科技城的新創科用地會以三個樞紐、三個產業發展帶（三紐、三帶）劃分和發展，即由北至南的河套樞紐、洲頭樞紐及麒麟樞紐，以及生命健康科技發展帶、人工智能與機械人發展帶及微電子與先進產業發展帶。此規劃結構結合創科產業布局節奏和相關收地和工務部門土地平整工程時間表，劃分為五個發展階段，從導入、產業生態延展、產城中樞，以至完善階段。

在推展每一階段發展時，會以發展樞紐為統籌引領，發展其主要先進產業，並強調產城融合，除了引進企業成立總部、打造商業綜合體，並設有人才公寓空間，為創科人才提供各項城市配套。除此以外，規劃上亦結合實際情況，並預留一定發展彈性，提供戰略留白區，以在後續階段支援未來新興科技產業。

就開發模式而言，按有為政府、高效市場原則，新田科技城的開發工作可考慮以成立專屬公司的模式與市場共同參與開發，利用市場化資源提升開發速度、優化開發成本。

根據顧問估算，新田科技城在完全運作階段預計每年將為香港本地生產總值帶來約2,500億港元或以上的貢獻，提供超過30萬個相關全職工作崗位。

新田一帶的新創科用地與河套香港園區將形成上中下游協同發展的重要紐帶，為創科產業提供辦公、原型、小試、中試、生產綜合空間的全鏈條配套支持。在國家「十四五」規劃及「十五五」規劃建議香港作為國際創科中心，以及未來香港「南金融、北創科」的新產業佈局下，新田科技城作爲香港創科發展不可或缺的關鍵部分，將成為香港未來新興科技產業發展的重鎮和發展新質生產力的重要基地。

Government promulgates Conceptual Outline of Development Plan for Innovation and Technology Industry in San Tin Technopole,2025-11-20 13:50,2025-11-20 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000367.htm,"  The Government promulgated the Conceptual Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San Tin Technopole today (November 20). The Conceptual Outline provides a top-level design for the 210 hectares of new innovation and technology (I&T) land in the San Tin Technopole in terms of development vision, objectives and positioning, industrial spatial layout, and development model, thereby setting a clear development strategy for the San Tin Technopole.

  The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, said that, ""The San Tin Technopole spans across a large area. Its development takes time and needs to be conducted in an orderly manner. Based on the schedule of land supply, the Conceptual Outline proposes a phased development plan, industrial positioning and layout, co-ordinated development of various land zones, and strategy to channel market resources into development. It serves as a clear guideline for the San Tin Technopole to develop into a strategic base for I&T industries.

  ""The San Tin Technopole has three major advantages. It is adjacent to the Hong Kong Park in the Loop and closely connected to the I&T ecosystems of Futian and Huanggang, giving it a locational advantage. Its provision of 210 hectares of new I&T land can meet the spatial needs of different segments of the industry chain, enterprises of varying scales and different technology fields, giving it a scale advantage. It also enjoys an excellent transportation network, and is close to Shenzhen and the Sam Po Shue Wetland Conservation Park, providing a favourable ecological environment and strengths as a liveable place.

  ""As a natural extension of the Loop, the new I&T land in the San Tin area can integrate with the comprehensive industry supply chains in the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. It can also take up the transformation and industrialisation of research outcomes derived from the Hong Kong Park. These would drive economic growth, create high-quality employment opportunities and lead to structural upgrades of industries. By focusing on the interaction between industries, talent, and space, it aims to create a virtuous cycle of enhancing the city's quality with industries, attracting talent with the city, and developing industries with talent.""

  The Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau commissioned a consultant to conduct a study. With views gauged from industry-related personnel and stakeholders, including I&T enterprises, academic institutions, chambers of commerce, and I&T associations, etc, the positioning of the development of the San Tin Technopole will be anchored on three key strands: (1) providing space for prototyping, pilot production, and small-scale manufacturing, (2) developing high-quality local I&T industries, and (3) pooling global I&T resources and talent.

  In terms of industry development, the San Tin Technopole can provide land of larger scale to support the development of strategic I&T industries such as life and health technology, AI and robotics, microelectronics and smart devices, new materials, new energy, and green technology, as set out in the Hong Kong I&T Development Blueprint. It will also focus on the building of Hong Kong's I&T industrial system with advanced manufacturing as its core.

  In terms of a layout plan of the land, the new I&T land in the San Tin Technopole will be divided and developed into three development hubs and three industry development corridors (the three hubs and three corridors). They are the Hetao Hub, Chau Tau Hub, and Ki Lun Hub from north to south, and the life and health technology corridor, AI and robotics corridor, and microelectronics and advanced industry corridor. This planning structure can cater for the pace of I&T industry development and the relevant timetable for land resumption and site formation works undertaken by works departments. The development will have five phases, from introduction, industry ecosystem expansion, city-industry hub to consolidation.

  In taking forward each phase of development, the development hubs will be used for co-ordinating and leading the development of its core advanced industries, emphasising a city-industry integration. This includes attracting enterprises to set up headquarters, creating commercial complexes, and providing talent accommodation which will offer various urban living amenities for I&T talent. The planning also takes into account actual circumstances and allows certain flexibility in development by reserving strategic white space for supporting emerging technology industries at subsequent phases in the future.

  In terms of a development model, following the principle of a capable government and an efficient market, consideration can be given to the establishment of a dedicated company to take forward the development of the San Tin Technopole in collaboration with the market, thereby leveraging market resources to accelerate development and optimise development costs.

  According to the estimates of the consultant, the San Tin Technopole will contribute some $250 billion or more to Hong Kong's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) annually upon its full operation, and provide over 300000 full-time equivalent work positions.

  The new I&T land around San Tin and the Hong Kong Park will together form a crucial node for the integrated development of upstream, midstream and downstream industries, offering full-chain support to I&T industries by providing space for offices, prototyping, test and pilot production, as well as manufacturing. Under the National 14th Five-Year Plan and the recommendations for the 15th Five-Year Plan for Hong Kong as an international I&T centre and Hong Kong's new industrial layout of a South-North dual engine (finance-I&T) in the future, the San Tin Technopole, as an indispensable key part of Hong Kong's I&T development, will become a stronghold for the future development of emerging technology industries in Hong Kong and an important base for developing new quality productive forces.

​勞工及福利局局長為香港社會服務聯會X招商局「e賃務」樂齡科技租賃網購平台暨「齡活共創‧社福同行」香港與內地樂齡科技協作啓動儀式致辭（只有中文）,2025-11-20 12:31,2025-11-20 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000342.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十一月二十日）上午為香港社會服務聯會X招商局「e賃務」樂齡科技租賃網購平台暨「齡活共創‧社福同行」香港與內地樂齡科技協作啓動儀式致開幕辭的全文：

Kennedy（香港社會服務聯會執行委員會副主席廖達賢博士）、周和博士（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室社會工作部副部長）、黃哲局長（深圳市民政局黨組書記、局長）、楊樹林處長（深圳市民政局老齡工作處處長）、樂成處長（深圳市民政局政策法規處處長）、邱婧處長（深圳市民政局養老服務處處長）、鍾國東先生（招商局集團有限公司董事、招商局慈善基金會副理事長）、各位嘉賓：

我很高興在這個比較寒冷的早上來到這個溫暖的場地，一起出席由香港社會服務聯會（社聯）主辦的「e賃務」樂齡科技租賃網購平台暨「齡活共創‧社福同行」香港與內地樂齡科技協作啓動儀式。活動名字雖然很長，但其實意義非常簡單，就是希望讓合用、便宜、又好的樂齡科技產品可以落戶千家萬戶，令到香港有需要的長者、殘疾人士，可以有能負擔的選擇。我相信這是「e賃務」要達成的最大目的。

九年前社聯開始做樂齡科技博覽時，都是好像初生兒般去試做，經歷九年後其實十分成功，現在樂齡科技已經成為大家掛在口邊的一個詞彙。但過去八年都是主要做展覽，就是給樣辦你看，看完後你覺得好，哪裏可買得到？是不是可以負擔得起？這是一個大挑戰。過去數年其實政府做了很多工作，我們先後拿了共20億出來做樂齡及康復創科應用基金。當然基金重點是給資助機構，最初只是機構自己添置設備，後來機構可以將設備借給用家回家用，這已是一個突破。

但如果要樂齡科技真正落地、可以服務大部分有需要人士，其實是需要入屋的。要入屋就要有做到以下數點，第一，產品標準要可信的，所以有了社聯做一個品牌、做一個品質保證的話，大家就不需要擔心那件產品本身是否可靠、是否符合標準。這已經不是問題。第二個要解決的是產品是否合用、以及是否能負擔的問題。所以這次「e賃務」的合作夥伴很多是來自內地的公司，亦彰顯了國家的獨有優勢──就是既做得好亦便宜。既然又好又便宜，香港應該作為一個窗口去使用。我知道廖達賢博士希望將「e賃務」變成為全國的「e賃務」平台，這是一個目標。我覺得香港可以做到更多的，就是作為香港和海外華人的橋樑。如果他們要買樂齡科技產品，想用內地又好又便宜的產品，就可以通過這個平台選購。

其實海外華人的數目是不少的，香港有一個特殊位置，香港雖然只有700萬人口，當中有170萬是老人家，也有幾十萬的殘疾人士，但在香港受歡迎的產品、在香港可以落地的產品，我相信同樣地可以在東南亞、在亞洲其他地方，甚至歐美的華人社區同樣可以落地的。所以香港輻射的作用，為產品擴大的效益是可以好好把握的。

在這裡我十分感謝社聯，也要感謝招商局集團，他們多年來都跟我們通力合作。我很期待第一屆的「e賃務」可以取得成功，但這只是開始而已，我很期待在未來的日子裏，「e賃務」會越變越大。當大家一聽這三個字就知道大家選購到最好、最便宜、品質最好的樂齡科技產品，在這裏祝今日的儀式和「e賃務」取得圓滿成功。

這數日不論說甚麼最後都要作一個呼籲，我呼籲大家在即將舉行的十二月七日立法會換屆選舉，大家一定要出來投下你神聖的一票。如果家裏有長者、有殘疾人士的話，如果出行不方便都不用擔心的，因為全港216間長者地區中心、以及21間殘疾人士支援中心，全部都已經參與了社會福利署提供兩萬元的津貼計劃。大家可以找你周邊的所有社福機構幫大家，方便坐輪椅的、有出行困難的人士，同樣可以履行他們的公民責任，投下他們神聖的一票。多謝大家。"

The EDB expresses its gratitude to the school sector for continuously adopting diversified teaching strategies and measures to cater for the different needs of students and raise teaching effectiveness.

  ""The EDB will continue to work closely with all stakeholders and render full support to schools, including arranging teacher training, organising diversified activities and providing appropriate school-based support services, to strengthen teachers' professional capacities. Meanwhile, the EDB will continue to develop learning and teaching resources, such as continuing to enhance the Student Assessment Repository as a one-stop platform for learning, teaching, and assessment with the 'Self-selected Assessments' feature added and exploring the application of artificial intelligence in the repository, with a view to providing schools and students with a more flexible and diversified platform with instant feedback, catering for the different needs of students, and enhancing their learning interests and abilities.""

The HKEAA will later directly provide primary and secondary schools with school-level data for use as feedback on learning and teaching. With a view to promoting and supporting schools in making effective use of assessment data and information to enhance learning and teaching, the EDB will hold thematic seminars on ""Promoting Assessment for Learning"" in December with regard to the 2025 TSA report.

Hugh (President of UFI (Global Association of the Exhibition Industry), Mr Hugh Jones), Chris (Chief Executive Officer of UFI, Mr Chris Skeith), Peter (Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Dr Peter Lam), Fred (Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam), Simon (Chairman of AsiaWorld-Expo Management Limited, Mr Simon Li), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a pleasure to join the opening ceremony of the 92nd UFI Global Congress. This year marks the 100th anniversary of UFI. My heartiest congratulations to you on this momentous occasion.

  For a century, UFI has been the definite leader in the global exhibition industry. Your commitment to high professional standards and international partnership has elevated the global recognition of the exhibition industry and made it a vital driver of global trade and investment.

  This congress brings together 600 participants from some 50 economies. For those who are coming from afar, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong.

  At its core, exhibitions are about forging business connections and promoting trade in products and services. Your choice of the AWE (AsiaWorld-Expo) at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) as the congress venue speaks volumes about your focus on connectivity. HKIA is the gateway to the Chinese Mainland, the broader Asian region and beyond, with over 1 100 flights to over 200 destinations every day.

  Indeed, Hong Kong’s role has always been a “super connector”. Under the “one country, two systems” framework, we enjoy convenient and sometimes priority access to the Chinese Mainland market, while maintaining the characteristics that define our success as an international trade, business and financial hub: a common law legal system; rule of law; free port status allowing free flow of goods, capital, information and people; and alignment with the best international standards and practices. We are proud to be recognised as the world’s freest economy and one of the top three international financial centres.

  One of Hong Kong’s major advantages for MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) events is the easy accessibility by Mainland and international visitors. And the number of visitors has been rising after the pandemic. In the first 10 months of this year, we welcomed more than 41 million visitors, a 12 per cent increase year-on-year. Last year, the AWE and the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre together hosted more than 350 events, drawing over 9 million participants. This year, the performance of the MICE sector would be even more optimistic.

  MICE events in Hong Kong are remarkable not only in scale, but also in their diversity and impact. Take, for example, the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit held earlier this month. It is a gathering of the world’s most influential bankers, fund managers and investors. Of the 300 participants, about half were from overseas, with 100 of them being chairmen or CEOs of global financial institutions. Or consider the Wine & Spirits Fair or the electronics show, where we proudly showcase a wide range of the finest and most trendy products from around the globe. The jewelry trade show here is also the world’s largest.

  We often strategically programme major MICE events with signature sports and cultural activities, creating a continuous stream of excitement for participants and visitors. We also integrate these events with Hong Kong’s diverse tourism offerings - from pop concerts and horse racing to fine dining and cultural explorations. Our goal is to enrich visitors’ itineraries and experiences in Hong Kong, so that they would like to stay longer, discover more and return more often.

  We are committed to building long-term partnerships, and many signature events have become permanent fixtures on Hong Kong’s calendar. Art Basel, the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens and LIV Golf are just a few prominent examples.

  We are now expanding our capacity to host world-class exhibitions. The AWE is undergoing a major expansion, adding over 33 000 square metres of space by 2028. Meanwhile, the Government is working to expand the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre to add more exhibition space. These investments reflect our strong commitment and confidence in the future of the exhibition industry in Hong Kong.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the evolving landscape of the exhibition industry is creating new and unprecedented opportunities. Digital innovation and hybrid formats are extending the reach of events, enabling organisers to connect global audiences while enriching the immersive, face-to-face experiences that make exhibitions irreplaceable. These will enable organisers to maximise reach and engagement across platforms, thus creating new revenue streams.

  At the same time, the growing global focus on environmental stewardship is driving innovation in venue design, operational efficiency and supply chain management. Organisers are encouraged to turn sustainability from a regulatory requirement into business opportunities and competitive advantages.

  Over the next few days, I trust you will enjoy the rich exchanges of ideas and insights this Congress offers. Connect with peers from different regions, forge collaboration and partnerships.

  While you’re here, I invite you to explore all that Hong Kong has to offer: a rich calendar of cultural and sporting events, a breathtaking geopark, country parks, hiking trails, and world-renowned dining and entertainment. We are home to the world’s best hotel and best bar - and, if I might add, we don’t tax on wine!

  Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you a most successful and inspiring Congress, and a memorable stay in Hong Kong. Thank you."
