衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-10-20 17:10,2025-10-20 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000620.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（十月二十日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十月十二日至十八日期間，衞生防護中心錄得三宗退伍軍人病個案，當中兩宗屬社區感染，一宗屬輸入個案。詳情如下：

社區感染個案：

41歲男病人，有長期病患，居於大埔區；及
68歲男病人，過往健康良好，居於觀塘區。


輸入個案：

69歲男病人，有長期病患，居於中國內地。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這三宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至十月十八日，今年錄得132宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-10-20 17:10,2025-10-20 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000622.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 20) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From October 12 to 18, the CHP recorded three LD cases. Among them, two were community-acquired cases and one was an imported case. The details of the cases are as follows:

Community-acquired cases:

a 41-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Tai Po District; and
a 68-year-old male patient with good past health living in Kwun Tong District.


Imported case:

a 69-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living on the Chinese Mainland.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these three cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of October 18, 132 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

Director of Health attends WHO Western Pacific Regional Committee meeting and DH elected as official rapporteur for current session (with photos),2025-10-20 17:05,2025-10-20 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000561.htm,"  âThe Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, today (October 20) led a delegation from the Department of Health (DH) to attend the meeting of the 76th session of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Committee for the Western Pacific in Fiji. He engaged in in-depth discussions with representatives from other countries and regions on major health issues of common concern. They explored practical response strategies and ways to strengthen the resilience of health systems. Dr Lam also shared on public health and medical reforms and achievements in Hong Kong, China.

  During the opening session today, Dr Lam reported on the latest developments and challenges in public health in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). ""The HKSAR has established a resilient public health system. We have enjoyed one of the best indices in terms of life expectancies, maternal and infant mortality rates, etc, as well as quality healthcare services. These achievements are attributed to a solid foundation established across various public health areas, including disease surveillance, disease prevention, and responsive medical services. At the same time, the HKSAR shares many challenges with other member states of the WHO, such as an ageing population, the ongoing strain on the healthcare workforce, the dual threats of non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases, and rising healthcare expenditure,"" Dr Lam said.

  To address the abovementioned issues, ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that Hong Kong, China is deepening its healthcare reform and enhancing the sustainability of the Hong Kong healthcare system through a series of measures. These include enhancing the public healthcare system, promoting healthcare manpower development, strengthening primary healthcare services, enhancing cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment, promoting the development of Chinese Medicine (CM), promoting mental health, and developing an international health and medical innovation hub.

  ""Hong Kong, China is pressing ahead with targeted, far-reaching health reforms. We are transforming our primary health care from a treatment focus to a prevention focus and tailoring it to individual health needs; exploring systemic solutions to alleviate healthcare workforce pressures; accelerating the responsible adoption of artificial intelligence and smart and digital healthcare systems to enhance the efficiency and coverage of our services; taking forward health promotion and disease prevention initiatives in a life-course approach; and mobilising resources to tackle health issues of vulnerable groups,"" Dr Lam added.

  He emphasised that the theme of the WHO Western Pacific Region, ""Weaving Health for Families, Communities and Societies in the Western Pacific Region (2025-2029)"", closely aligns with the healthcare reform objectives outlined in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"". Hong Kong, China will continue to collaborate closely with the WHO to advance global and Western Pacific regional health objectives.

  The five-day meeting runs until October 24. During the meeting, participants will also discuss mental and psychological health care, the impact of climate change on health system safety and resilience, oral health, alcohol control, artificial intelligence in healthcare systems, hypertension control, safer surgery and tobacco control, among other topics. The Controller of Regulatory Affairs of the DH, Dr Fung Ying, will introduce the HKSAR's new phase of tobacco control measures at the meeting. The DH was unanimously elected by all member states and regions of the WHO Western Pacific Region to serve as the official rapporteur for this session, responsible for ensuring that the resolutions adequately reflect the views of member states and regions to promote the effective implementation of the regional programme.

  With the support of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the DH has actively collaborated with and supported the WHO in addressing various public health challenges and contributing to global public health over the years. The DH has been designated by the WHO as a Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine and a Collaborating Centre for Smoking Cessation and Treatment of Tobacco Dependence, assisting the WHO in formulating global strategies for traditional medicine. Furthermore, the DH regularly provides training programmes on tobacco controland training in smoking cessation treatment for healthcare professionals as well as tobacco control and smoking cessation practitioners in the HKSAR, on the Chinese Mainland and throughout the entire Western Pacific Region. The DH also conducts CMAcupuncture Smoking Cessation Training Workshops to help frontline CM practitioners enhance their knowledge and skills in delivering cessation treatment. Regarding training, to date, over 1 000 individuals have participated in these programmes and training. Additionally, the WHO has designated the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH as a reference laboratory for various communicable diseases, including tuberculosis, measles/rubella, influenza A (H5), SARS and COVID-19, making significant contributions to fighting epidemics worldwide.

  With the support of the Central Government and under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the DH will continue to maintain close liaison with the WHO member states and regions on various public health protection issues. Through multilateral collaboration and consensus-building, the DH will further enhance and safeguard overall public health in the region."

財庫局局長就檢討政府採購機制專責小組提出的先行措施會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-20 16:57,2025-10-20 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000347.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇今日（十月二十日）公布檢討政府採購機制專責小組提出的先行措施。以下為財庫局局長及首長級甲一級政務官劉焱會見傳媒的開場發言：

政府採購樽裝飲用水事件發生後，引起社會廣泛關注，公眾期望政府採取果斷和有效的跟進行動。為此，我在八月成立了「檢討政府採購機制專責小組」（專責小組），聯同多個政策局和部門的同事，與政府物流服務署（物流署）一起以主人翁思維審視現有的政府採購機制和程序，務求完善現有採購制度，推出措施堵塞漏洞，做好把關工作。

在審視機制和程序的同時，我們注意到有關事件固然涉及個別公司的懷疑欺詐行為，但同時亦顯示相關人員在盡職審查和應對潛在欺詐行為方面，其洞察力和警覺性未能配合現今商業社會狀況，亦與合理期望有明顯落差。我和專責小組都認為，要確保政府人員日後能更有效執行採購工作，必須從根本去重塑工作文化，提升採購人員的盡職審查能力和在制度上賦予他們足夠權力，讓他們除了擔當公平競爭的推動者，更重要的是做好政府採購的把關者。

正如早前承諾大家，我會在整個檢討完成前就一些重點事項提出即時可行的方案。經過商討和研究，專責小組提出了六項先行措施，我已督導物流署即時落實。這六項先行措施圍繞三大方面，分別是（1）制度改革、（2）加強部門間的信息互通和（3）重塑工作文化。我現在向大家介紹詳情。

首先，制度改革是要針對盡職審查及招標和合約管理方面的不足：

（一）發放內部指引訂明盡職審查具體要求

物流署八月底向各政策局和部門發出內部便箋，就採購和管理合約過程中須做好盡職審查的節點作出提醒。當時，物流署亦密鑼緊鼓起草內部工作指引，以訂明在擬備招標文件、評審標書及合約管理各個階段進行盡職審查的具體要求和提供詳細指引。這份內部工作指引今日已經發放給政府內負責做採購的人員，讓他們進行採購和管理合約時更有把握，包括驗證文件、背景審查、實地視察，以及應對可疑事項的跟進行動。我想強調，指引的目的不是要採購人員機械式核查項目清單，即不是單純check the box，絕對不是，而是讓有關人員明白各個採購階段的應有考量，並懂得如何應用於各式各樣的政府採購，從而有效防範潛在欺詐行為。

（二）成立「採購及物料管理審核組」加強抽查

過往，物流署一直設有內部審計專隊查核各部門的採購過程有否遵從相關規例和指引。為了提升各部門採購時的警覺性及防範意識，物流署十月起已經擴大這個專隊的職能，並重組為「採購及物料管理審核組」，作為第三方審查專隊，以風險為本原則加強抽查各部門採購時的盡職審查工作。審查期間若發現有不足的地方，審核組將適時上報有關部門首長正視，徹底改善各部門的採購流程。

（三）修訂《招標和合約的標準條款》加強審查和管理合約權力

有指引可跟，有專組可用，也需要配以適當法律依據理順同事執行盡職審查的工作。因此，我們會加強政府在招標和合約管理方面的權力。物流署今日已修訂《招標和合約的標準條款》，規定投標者和承辦商須同意政府可直接向第三方核實所提交資料的真確性，以及容許政府在審核標書過程和合約期間進行實地視察等。我們相信經修訂的條款不單可以協助政府在審核標書時阻截有問題的標書，更可以在發現承辦商提交虛假陳述或不真確資料時，即時終止合約，維護政府的權益，保障公帑。

要做到準確判斷，充足的資訊是其中關鍵。為此，第四項先行措施便是要加強部門間的信息互通。

（四）設立電子資料庫共享資訊

作為政府專職採購和物料供應的部門，物流署固然每日會進行不少的採購項目，但各部門亦會自行根據其需要進行採購。不同政策局和部門因應其需求，接觸的承辦商也不盡相同，標書的設定也會有差異。這些「不同」與「差異」正正是其他部門所未能掌握的寶貴經驗，我們認為若能將這些資訊，包括承辦商履行合約時出現過的異常情況在政府內部加強互通，將對同事極具參考作用。

因此，物流署已於十月中正式推出了一個內部電子資料庫，作為整個政府各局各署互通的採購資訊網。電子資料庫只開放予政府內部使用，持續蒐集各部門有關承辦商投標情況和合約表現的資訊。透過共享資訊，部門在採購以至評標時便有多一重參考，同事就可更有效地及早識別高風險投標者。

政府人員進行採購向來也依規循矩，但在現今社會，我們實在要多點心：多一點疑心、多一分小心，也要更加上心，我們認為這些工作需要從培訓和重塑工作文化去做。

（五）加強人員培訓防範詐騙

事件發生後，我們意識到同事對詐騙行為的認知和警覺性不足。因此，我們隨即聯絡了香港警務處和香港海關，邀請他們運用其專業知識和經驗，於九月為負責採購和財務工作的人員舉辦講座，透過講解騙案手法，向同事傳授各種識別技巧，提升他們的防騙意識，共有超過750人次參加。

剛才提到物流署已發放新的內部工作指引，署方亦正安排培訓班，為同事詳細講解，讓他們能掌握執行細節。

（六）建立主人翁工作文化

無論有多嚴謹的制度、多完善的執行工具，但「人」始終是採購和合約管理重中之重的元素。我認為培養同事的主人翁意識，重塑工作文化，會令同事為政府進行採購時，像為自己購物一樣謹慎。同事若能將這種意識植入他們日常工作中，自然便能做好把關工作，保障政府和公眾利益。

我們在構思及落實上述各項措施時，透過不同渠道鼓勵同事提出意見，當中包括物流署在九月舉行兩場員工交流會，並在草擬各項優化措施時主動諮詢各部門負責採購的同事。我們細心採納同事的意見，亦照顧他們的關注和憂慮，提供適切的指引和工具。我們希望透過雙向的溝通，賦能採購人員、培養同事的「當家」意識，令他們有「作主」的能力和擔當。

日後，物流署也會將這種主人翁工作文化融入入職培訓，讓新同事自入職起便能將這種心態植根心中，更好掌握市民對使用公帑及保障政府權益的期望。

相信大家都明白，心態上的改變並非一朝一夕可以達成。物流署會繼續透過入職培訓、恆常培訓活動和員工交流會等，將「盡職盡心，採購為民」的主人翁心態化成部門的工作文化中一個核心部分。

我們相信，能早於檢討報告發表前落實這些先行措施，是對社會聲音的正面和積極回應，也表達我們落實改革的決心。

就一些牽涉政策層面比較廣的優化方案，專責小組正進行研究，我們會繼續以「表裏兼顧、標本兼治」為目標，讓政府採購工作更臻完善，確保公帑用得其所。

另外，我們今早已收到審計署就審查採購樽裝飲用水招標過程所提交的管理建議書。我十分感謝審計署同事盡心為我們審視了事件，查找招標過程中有所疏漏或不足之處，也提出不少建議。審計署的建議與我們已經落實的先行措施和正研究的長遠優化方案方向一致，我們會詳細研究，令長遠優化方案能更全面、更徹底地為我們的採購和合約管理機制帶來革新。

管理建議書同時點出事件中有人為疏漏的情況。我在八月專責小組首次會議後曾向你們說過，若調查發現有人為因素，政府必定會嚴肅處理。因此，下一步的工作就是進行紀律調查，釐清有關涉事人員在事件上的責任、是否涉及違反政府或部門規定從而構成不當行為而需要紀律跟進，抑或是工作表現未能達到其職級及經驗應有的標準而需透過管理措施處理。

一般紀律調查是會由部門自行去進行，但由於處理是次採購樽裝飲用水事件的過程涉及物流署和財經事務及庫務局高層同事，我認為適宜由從未參與事件的政府人員進行調查，以示公正。為此，我已邀請首長級甲一級政務官劉焱女士負責進行紀律調查，劉女士是政府最資深的常任秘書長，由她負責這項工作是適合的。初步看來，紀律調查會涉及十多名來自物流署及庫務科的同事。

正如我們一直處理今次採購樽裝飲用水事件的做法，我們會繼續站在公眾利益的角度，開誠布公，所以雖然審計署的管理建議書只是給予部門，但我們會將整份管理建議書全面公開，展現我們處理事件的透明度和革新的決心。

接下來，我將時間交給劉女士（Alice）。

首長級甲一級政務官劉焱：大家好。正如局長（財經事務及庫務局局長）剛才所說，審計署已就政府採購樽裝飲用水事件完成了他們的工作，亦已提交報告。他們的建議除指出政府在採購過程和合約管理方面有需要改善的地方外，同時亦點出事件中似乎有人為疏漏的情況，所以有必要進行紀律調查。

紀律調查的焦點是希望釐清涉事人員在事件上的責任輕重，例如是否有人員在行事過程中違反政府或部門的內部規定，也就是說有不當行為，因而需要向他們作出紀律跟進；又或是否有人員工作表現未能符合其職級及經驗應有的標準，因而需向他們採取管理措施。

我們會即時開始調查工作。在調查過程中，我們會覆檢相關文件，以識別哪些是涉事人士，再聯絡他們要求作出陳述。如果有需要，可能亦會約見其中一些涉事人員。整個過程的目的是希望可以找出在事件不同階段中所有涉事人員所扮演的角色及應該承擔的責任，例如在準備招標文件及審批標書的過程中有否做好、做足盡職審查；以及在批出合約後，在合約管理過程中發現問題時有否妥善處理、有否疏漏之處等。

我們的目標是於今年年底完成有關調查。若調查顯示任何人員有紀律或表現問題，會交由公務員事務局跟進。多謝大家。"
二零二五年七月至九月失業及就業不足統計數字,2025-10-20 16:30,2025-10-20 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000516.htm,"根據政府統計處今日（十月二十日）發表的最新勞動人口統計數字（即二零二五年七月至九月的臨時數字），經季節性調整的失業率由二零二五年六月至八月的3.7%上升至二零二五年七月至九月的3.9%。就業不足率在該兩段期間則保持不變，維持於1.6%的水平。

與二零二五年六月至八月比較，在二零二五年七月至九月期間，許多主要經濟行業的失業率（不經季節性調整）均見上升，其中社會工作活動業及建造業有較明顯的升幅。同期，餐飲服務活動業的失業率維持不變，金融業及人類保健活動業的失業率則錄得下跌。各行業的就業不足率變動不一，但幅度普遍不大。

總就業人數由二零二五年六月至八月的3 680 600人，下跌至二零二五年七月至九月的3 674 500人，減少約6 100人。同期的總勞動人口亦由3 831 600人下跌至3 830 100人，減少約1 500人。

失業人數（不經季節性調整）由二零二五年六月至八月的151 000人上升至二零二五年七月至九月的155 600人，增加約4 600人。同期的就業不足人數亦由59 400人上升至60 000人，增加約600人。

評論

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡評論最新失業數字時表示：「二零二五年七月至九月經季節性調整的失業率較上一個三個月期間上升0.2個百分點至3.9%。就業不足率維持在1.6%不變。同期勞動人口和總就業人數稍為下跌。」

展望未來，孫玉菡說：「香港經濟繼續擴張，預計會為職位增長提供支持。然而，一些行業在經濟轉型中，就業情況仍會繼續面對挑戰。外圍不明朗因素增加，亦可能影響企業的招聘意欲。政府會繼續密切留意勞工市場狀況，並致力促進就業資訊流通，協助市民就業。」

進一步資料

失業和就業不足的統計數字，是根據持續進行的「綜合住戶統計調查」結果而編製。

統計調查所採用有關失業及就業不足的定義，緊隨國際勞工組織的建議。當中，就業人口涵蓋所有僱主、自營作業者、僱員（包括全職、兼職及散工等）和無酬家庭從業員。而按行業（或職業）劃分的失業人士是按其以前從事的行業（或職業）劃分。

Unemployment and underemployment statistics for July - September 2025,2025-10-20 16:30,2025-10-20 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000520.htm,"  According to the latest labour force statistics (i.e. provisional figures for July - September 2025) released today (October 20) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased from 3.7% in June - August 2025 to 3.9% in July - September 2025. The underemployment rate remained unchanged at 1.6% in the two periods.

  Comparing July - September 2025 with June - August 2025, the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) increased in many major economic sectors, with more distinct increases observed in the social work activities sector and construction sector. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate for the food and beverage service activities sector remained unchanged, while declines were seen in the financing sector and human health activities sector. Movements in the underemployment rate in different industry sectors varied, but the magnitudes were generally not large.

  Total employment decreased by around 6 100 from 3 680 600 in June - August 2025 to 3 674 500 in July - September 2025. Over the same period, the labour force also decreased by around 1 500 from 3 831 600 to 3 830 100.

  The number of unemployed persons (not seasonally adjusted) increased by around 4 600 from 151 000 in June - August 2025 to 155 600 in July - September 2025. Over the same period, the number of underemployed persons also increased by around 600 from 59 400 to 60 000.

Commentary

  Commenting on the latest unemployment figures, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, said, ""The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate went up by 0.2 percentage point over the preceding three-month period to 3.9% in July - September 2025. The underemployment rate remained unchanged at 1.6%. Over the same period, the labour force and total employment edged down slightly.""

  Looking ahead, Mr Chris Sun said, ""The continued expansion of the Hong Kong economy is expected to support job growth. However, the employment situation in some sectors would continue to face challenges during economic restructuring. The increasing external uncertainties could also weigh on corporate hiring sentiment. The Government will continue to closely monitor the labour market situation and facilitate job-seeking through enhancing dissemination of employment information.""

Further information

  The unemployment and underemployment statistics were compiled from the findings of the continuous General Household Survey.

  In the survey, the definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment follow closely those recommended by the International Labour Organization. The employed population covers all employers, self-employed persons, employees (including full-time, part-time, casual workers, etc.) and unpaid family workers. Unemployed persons by industry (or occupation) are classified according to their previous industry (or occupation).

  The survey for July - September 2025 covered a sample of some 26 000 households or 68 000 persons, selected in accordance with a scientifically designed sampling scheme to represent the population of Hong Kong. Labour force statistics compiled from this sample represented the situation in the moving three-month period of July to September 2025.

  Data on labour force characteristics were obtained from the survey by interviewing each member aged 15 or over in the sampled households.

  Statistical tables on the latest labour force statistics can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode200.html). More detailed analysis of the labour force characteristics is given in the ""Quarterly Report on General Household Survey"" which is published four times a year. The latest issue of the report contains statistics for the quarter April - June 2025 while the next issue covering the quarter July - September 2025 will be available by end November 2025. Users can also browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1050001&scode=200).

衞生署署長出席世衞西太平洋區域委員會會議　署方當選本屆會議官方報告員,2025-10-20 16:05,2025-10-20 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000262.htm,"衞生署署長林文健醫生今日（十月二十日）率領衞生署代表團到斐濟出席世界衞生組織（世衞）西太平洋區域委員會第七十六屆會議，與其他國家和地區的代表圍繞多個全球共同關心的重大健康議題進行深入交流，探討切實可行的應對策略及強化衞生系統韌性的有效途徑，並介紹中國香港在公共衞生及醫療領域的改革及成就。

林文健醫生今日在首天會議上，匯報了香港特別行政區（特區）在公共衞生方面的最新情況和挑戰。他說：「香港特區建立了堅韌的公共衞生體系，人口預期壽命、孕婦及嬰兒死亡率等核心健康指標，以及醫療服務質素均居全球前列。這些成就有賴於公共衞生領域包括疾病監測預警、疾病預防以及醫療服務等各方面構築成的紮實基礎。與此同時，香港特區和其他世衞成員一樣，正面臨人口老化、醫療人力供應持續緊張、傳染病與非傳染病雙重威脅、醫療開支攀升等挑戰。」

為應對上述的問題，《行政長官2025年施政報告》宣布，中國香港正透過提升公營醫療體系、推動醫療人手發展、強化基層醫療服務、加強癌症預防、篩查、診斷和治療，以至推動中醫藥發展、促進精神健康、發展國際醫療創新樞紐等措施深化醫療改革，提升香港醫療體系的可持續性。

林文健醫生續表示：「中國香港正推進有針對性的深層次醫療改革：轉型基層醫療，從『治已病』轉向『重預防』為重心，並契合個體健康需求；探索系統方案緩解醫護人手壓力；加快合理應用人工智能、智慧及數碼醫療健康體系以提升服務效率與人口覆蓋面；以全生命周期理念推進健康促進與疾病預防；調配資源解決弱勢群體的健康等問題。」

他強調，世衞西太平洋地區「共建西太平洋區域家庭、社區和社會的健康（2025-2029）」願景，與《行政長官2025年施政報告》的醫療衞生改革目標高度契合，中國香港將繼續與世衞緊密合作，助力全球及西太平洋地區健康目標實現。

會議為期五日，直至十月二十四日。期間，與會代表亦會討論精神和心理健康護理、氣候變化對衞生系統安全與韌性的影響、口腔健康、酒精管控、人工智能在醫療保健方面的應用、防治高血壓、手術安全和煙草管控等議題。衞生署規管事務總監封螢醫生將在會上闡述本港新一階段控煙措施。而衞生署亦獲世衞西太平洋區全體成員國及地區一致選任以擔當本屆官方報告員，負責確保決議案充分體現會員國及地區的意見，以促進區域計劃的有效實施。

衞生署多年來在國家衞生健康委員會支持下，一直積極配合並支持世衞在應對各項公共衞生挑戰的工作，為全球公共衞生作出貢獻。衞生署分別獲世衞指定為世衞傳統醫藥合作中心和世衞控煙及煙癮治療合作中心，協助世衞制定全球傳統醫藥戰略；定期為本地、中國內地，以至整個西太平洋地區的醫護人員、控煙及戒煙工作者提供控煙專才培訓計劃和戒煙治療的訓練，亦有舉辦中醫針灸戒煙服務培訓班，以協助前線中醫師進一步提升戒煙知識及技能。培訓方面，至今有超過1 000人參與上述的計劃和訓練。此外，衞生署衞生防護中心公共衞生化驗服務處亦獲世衞指定為多項傳染病，包括結核病、麻疹及風疹、甲型流感（H5）、嚴重急性呼吸系統綜合症和2019冠狀病毒病的指定參比實驗室，為全球防疫作出巨大貢獻。

在中央的支持及「一國兩制」的基礎上，衞生署會繼續就各項保障市民健康的議題與世衞成員國及地區保持緊密聯繫，透過多邊協作凝聚共識，進一步提升和保障區內整體公共衞生。"

海關人員於十月十八日在落馬洲支線管制站截查一名六十五歲抵港女旅客，並在她身上及其攜帶的紙皮盒內檢獲三百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約一千五百元，應課稅值約一千二百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Customs officers intercepted a 65-year-old incoming female passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on October 18 and seized 381 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $1,500 and a duty potential of about $1,200 found on her and from a carton box in her possession. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

He said that with the high-quality development of the national economy, an increasing number of outstanding Mainland enterprises are actively expanding to overseas markets, while at the same time facing many challenges. Hong Kong has always been a springboard for Mainland enterprises to go global, and is the only common law jurisdiction in the country with both Chinese and English as official languages under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, making Hong Kong an important hub linking the Mainland and the rest of the world. He said he hopes that the training course will enable participants to comprehensively understand current trends in overseas expansion, keep abreast of evolving legal and regulatory challenges, and effectively tackle the complex issues encountered by enterprises when ""going overseas"".

Participants in this course, including over 30 legal advisors and related professionals from state-owned enterprises, will explore the practical and imminent legal issues and challenges faced by Chinese enterprises going global. Speakers of the lectures include experienced legal professionals from Hong Kong and overseas, as well as members of the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Expert Committee. The Academy also invited more than 10 senior legal practitioners from 12 jurisdictions in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa, to share their first-hand experiences and insights in the local markets with participants in three sessions.

The Academy will continue to leverage the unique advantages of ""one country, two systems"" and the Hong Kong common law system, and organise different courses to promote Hong Kong's legal services in assisting Mainland enterprises in going global."

培訓班的參加者包括30多位來自中央企業法律顧問及相關專業人士，課程將深入探討中國企業「出海」面臨的現實和急迫的法律問題及挑戰。講座的講者為本港和海外的資深法律界人士和香港國際法律人才培訓專家委員會成員，而培訓學院亦邀請了來自東南亞、中東和非洲等12個司法管轄區的10多位資深法律從業員在三個環節向參加者分享他們在當地市場的親身經驗和見解。

培訓學院將繼續發揮「一國兩制」和香港普通法的獨特優勢，通過舉辦更多不同類型的課程推廣香港法律服務，助力內地企業「出海」。"

內務委員會在今個會期考慮了200項附屬法‍例，並成立了總共11個小組委員會，而且詳細研究其‍中27‍項附屬法例，當中包‍括有關推行無紙證券市‍場制‍度、實施註冊消防工程師計劃，以及強制的士安裝行車記錄系統和規定的士司機須容許透過電子繳費媒‍介繳付的士車費。

特‍別值得一提的是，內務委員會成立了小組委‍員會詳細研究兩‍項根據《維‍護國家安全條例》制訂涉及國安公署的附屬法例，使駐港國安公署的角色和行使權力的規範更清晰明確。由於國家安全風險可能突如其‍來，香港特區有憲制責任盡早完成有關《維護國家安全條例》附屬法例的立法工作，進一步完善維護國家安‍全的法律制度和執行機制。內務委員會支持政府「早一日、得一日」推進立法工作的目標，該兩項附‍屬法例於今年五月十四日提交立法會省覽後，隨即於第二天，即五月十五日，召開特別會議，並決定成立小‍組‍委‍員會審議有關附屬法例。鑑於該兩項附屬法例是根‍據《維護國家安全條例》制訂，為確保審議工作的連貫性，內務委員會同意由去年負責審議《維護國‍家安全條例草案》的法案委員會原班委員，擔任附‍屬‍法‍例小組委員會的主席、副主席及委員。小組委‍員會亦立即於同日召開了三次會議，深入而全面地審議該兩項附屬法例，並第一時間在五月十六日的內務委員會上作出口頭報告，總結其審議工作。

研究政策事宜的小組委員會

今年有10個研究政策事宜小組委員會完成工‍作，當中有七個屬於內務委員會轄下，另外三個則在事務委員會轄下成‍立。這些小組委員會分別研究涉‍及人‍口政‍策、金融科技、智慧城市、支援殘疾人‍士和人‍力資源規劃，以及國際教育樞紐建設等多個政‍策範疇的事宜，並就各項觀察所得提出多項甚具參‍考價值的建議。各個小組委‍員‍會的工‍作報告已送交政務司司長及相關政策局考慮，當中不‍少建‍議亦已獲‍得當局採納。

最後，我想特別感謝主席李慧琼議員。在過去兩年，我們齊心協力，一同盡心做好內務委員會的每‍項工作。對於能夠以內務委員會副主席的身分，為‍議會高質素、高效運作，付出一分力，我深感光榮。

內務委員會主席︰

議事工作

本屆立法會是香港特區完善選舉制度和「愛國者治港」原則全面落實後產生的首屆立‍法‍會。這四年以來，在協助政府實現良政善治、開啟「由治及興」新局面的道路上，任重而道遠。作‍為特區管治團‍隊的重要組成部分，立法機關在今個會期繼續和行‍政機關良性互動，助力政府深‍化改革、加快社會經濟發展，以民生福祉為依‍歸。這特別體現在本屆立法會高質、高效審議法案的工作上。正如剛才副主席提到，立法會在本‍年‍度通過了41項政府法‍案，成績亮麗。特別感‍謝政務司司長，積極跟進我和副主席對法案提‍交立法會的時間表和審議進度提出的關注，結果大部分政府法案在今年四月底前已提交立‍法會，讓議員有較為充分的時‍間了解法案內容，並且進行仔細審議。

在法案委員會審議階段，各‍政‍策局亦積極配合法案委員會的工作，包括盡快就委員會提出的事項作出回應，令審議工作提速提效。議員亦切實履行憲制角色，仔細地審議草案文本，並從自身專業、廣大市民和整體社會發展的角度，在‍政策、條文和執行層面上提出多項有深度、有‍力‍度、有角度、有温度的寶貴意見，務求使法案達至完善的位置。

在‍議員和政府的共同努力下，這41項獲通過的政府法‍案當中，35項法案，即百分之八十五，在‍今‍年‍七月底前已獲通過。所通過的法案涵蓋不‍同政策範疇，既有提升民生福祉，亦‍有‍對社會及經濟發展非常關鍵的政策。我特別想指出，當中有為解決劣質「劏房」這個老大難問‍題，引入簡樸房規管制度；在新土地以業權註冊制度，取代已實行超過百年的契約註冊制度；就‍穩‍定幣發行人設立發牌制度，進一步鞏固香港國際金融中心地位；加強打擊濫用公屋，確保公‍營房屋資源得以善用；為引入合資格非本地培‍訓輔助醫‍療專業人‍員提供新途徑；以及引入規‍管網約車服務的法‍律框‍架，為個人化點對點交‍通服務締造良性及可持續發展的競爭環境等。

本年度是本屆立法會最後一個會期。回顧第‍七屆立法會四年會期，一共通過了130項法案，比第六屆立法會同期通過（法案）的數‍目，多‍出了49‍項，即百分之六十，展現出在行政主‍導體‍制下，立法會以善作善成之志，做實事、做成事的果‍效。我亦特別想提到，在本屆立法會，政府接受議員意見，將其轉化為修正案（的比例），總計有近百分之五十，是歷屆之冠。

議事程序

按照一貫做法，每屆立法會任期結束前，議‍員都會總結經‍驗，檢討和優化議會運作。在‍今‍個會期，內務委員會通過了由議‍事規則委‍員‍會提交優化議會運作的一籃子建議，當中重‍中之重，是‍有關完善立法會議員履職制度，制定《立法會議‍員守則》。其他建議包括優化政策事宜小組委員會的運作、優化委‍員會職‍務‍訪‍問的安排等。各項建議將‍會在第‍八‍屆立‍法‍會任期開‍始時實施，讓新一屆議員投‍入工作時有規可循，同‍時提‍升議會運作的透明度和效率，讓市‍民更‍深‍入了解和監察立‍法‍會議員的工‍作。這些成果展‍現出立‍法會自我完善、精‍益求精的擔當，為‍下‍一‍屆立‍法會繼續貫徹「愛‍國‍者治港」原則、更‍好發揮立‍法會憲制職能提供了良好的基礎。

行政立法關係

行政與立法機關積極互動，對促進良政善‍治是不可或缺。政府和立法會在今個會期繼‍續透過「行政長官互‍動交流答問會」和「立法會前廳交流會」進行全方位的交流和協作。前‍廳‍交‍流‍會在今個會期共舉行了四次，並注入了以‍事‍務‍委‍員‍會為基礎的新元素，務求令交流會發‍揮更大效用。議員與官員在交流會中就各項宏‍觀及微觀議題交換意見，進一步加強行政立法良性互‍動，令政府施政更貼地。本年度會期議‍員亦與行政長官舉行了一共兩次答問會及互動交流答問會，彼此就深化國際交往合作、加快發展北部都會區等議題互相交換意見、表達意見，推動香港主動對接國家發展戰略，積極融入國家發展大局。

本會期內，在內務委員會轄下的各個政策事‍宜小組委員會完成工作向內會作出報告後，我‍將相關報告轉交政務司司長，供其納入施政考‍量。除此之外，我亦特別安排了小組委員‍會與相關政策局舉行跟進會議，讓各小組委員會的主‍席及副主席，能夠與政策局局長聚焦交流報告中的重點建議，涉及的政策範疇包括金融科技、第二核心商業區發展、人口政策、工務工程效益、支援殘疾人士等。特別感謝行政長官、司長和各政策局局長高度重視議員的建議，在《施政報告》中採納‍了不少我們的意見，攜手推動香港邁向更高質量發展，全‍力改善民生，發展經濟。

此外，在內務委員會同意下，保安事務委員會聯同保安局前往廣州進行職務考察，了解當地在提升防罪工作和執法效率，以及提供便民服務方‍面的工作。公務員及資助機構員工事務委員會則聯同公務員事務局和數字政策辦公室前往深圳進行職務考察，了解深圳市政府應用人工智能輔‍助公職人員處理政務的情況。代表團向內‍務委‍員會委員作出報告後，已把報告交給相關政‍策‍局作為參考，當中所載的建議政府高度重視，整體安排展現行政立‍法高效務‍實、緊密協作的新氣象。

我和副主席在本年（會期）亦繼續積極擔當議會與行政機關的溝通橋樑，藉着每次內務委‍員‍會會議後與政務司司長的定期會面，保持行‍政立法之間的緊密聯繋。我們每次反映的事‍項，感謝司長很多時也親自積極跟進和處理。

與區議會的互動交流

隨着地區治理體系得到完善，立法會在上個會期與10個區‍議會進行了互動交流，今個會期則繼續安排與另外八個區議會會面，彼此就社區發展和市‍民關注的議題作深入交流和交‍換意見，讓‍立‍法‍會在宏觀的政策層面，聯‍同區‍議‍會在地區治‍理諮詢的層面，積極向政府建言獻‍策，務求令對市民的服務更「接地氣」，提升巿民的幸福感和獲得感。在會‍議上商議的事‍項，會‍視乎情‍況，部分交由政府考‍慮，亦有部分交由立法‍會相‍關的事務委員會作跟進，亦有部分交公共申訴辦‍事‍處處理。議員亦曾就個別（區）議會提出的意見，跟區議會議員「落區」實地考察，以跟進會上討論的事項。

結語

本屆議會任期即將結束，回望過去四年，議‍員以國務院港澳事務辦公室夏寶龍主任對第七屆立‍法‍會上任之初提‍出的「五點希望」為指引，牢記初心使命，積極擔當作為，做好立場堅定的愛國者、行政主導體‍制的維護者、真正的民意代言人、高‍質素的管‍治者，以及立法會新風貌的開創者。立法機關與行政機‍關既互相配合亦互相制衡，不‍斷提升香港治理效能，貫徹落實「一國兩制」。在現時「由治及興」進程的關鍵節點，香港需要變‍革與創新。展‍望未來，我期望在行政長官的帶領下，行政機關與第八屆立法會繼續保持緊密溝通，彼‍此更協同，更好地為香港市民服務。議員作為體制內政策制定的參與者、落實與監督者，定會積極為香港的繁榮穩定貢獻力量，承擔起推動香港社‍會更美好發展、更積極融入國家發展大局的責‍任，合作說好國家和香港故事，做到「民有所呼，為政者有所應」，為香港良政善治更好發揮作用。

最後，我亦再特別感謝陳健波副主席在過去兩‍年擔‍任內務委員會期間盡心盡力；我亦要感謝之前馬逢國副主席，在之前盡心盡力，就‍會‍議的運作提供意見及協助我主持部分會議。大‍家都已經知悉，陳議員已公開宣布不會尋求連任立法會議‍員，我藉此機會感謝他自二○○八年出任立‍法會議‍員以‍來，對議會工作貢獻良多。我亦特別感謝秘‍書‍處團隊和法律顧問在過去一年，以至本屆，為內務委員會、為各個事務委員會，為所有工作小組提‍供了許多專業支援。再次感謝各位議員的付出，因為內會這份亮麗的成績是各位一起創造出來的。"
政府落實先行措施堵塞採購漏洞並公布審計署管理建議書,2025-10-20 14:45,2025-10-20 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000282.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇今日（十月二十日）公布，政府物流服務署（物流署）已落實六項由檢討政府採購機制專責小組（專責小組）提出的先行措施，圍繞制度改革、加強部門間信息互通和重塑工作文化三方面，盡早堵塞政府採購程序的漏洞。另外，財庫局亦全面公開審計署就審查政府採購樽裝飲用水事件提交的管理建議書，以展示政府在處理事件上的透明度和革新採購和合約管理機制的決心。

許正宇說：「今次採購樽裝飲用水事件固然涉及個別公司的懷疑欺詐行為，但同時亦顯示相關人員在盡職審查和應對潛在欺詐行為方面，其洞察力和警覺性未能配合現今商業社會狀況，亦與合理期望有明顯落差。我和專責小組均認為，要確保政府人員日後能更有效執行採購工作，必須從根本去重塑工作文化，提升採購人員的盡職審查能力和在制度上賦予他們足夠權力，讓他們除了擔當公平競爭的推動者，更重要的是做好政府採購的把關者。」

他表示，專責小組自八月成立以來，一直研究各項可完善招標和採購機制和程序的措施。其中，專責小組認為有六項先行措施應盡早推出，以及早堵塞漏洞。財庫局已督導物流署即時落實這六項先行措施，詳情如下：

（一）發放內部指引訂明盡職審查具體要求：物流署在八月底向政府人員發出內部便箋，就採購和管理合約過程中須做好盡職審查的節點作出提醒。物流署今日進一步發放內部工作指引，訂明在擬備招標文件、評審投標書及合約管理各個階段進行盡職審查的具體要求和提供詳細指引，協助採購人員更有效防範潛在欺詐行為；

（二）成立「採購及物料管理審核組」加強抽查：物流署由十月起已擴大原有內部審計專隊的職能，並重組為「採購及物料管理審核組」，作為第三方審查專隊，以風險為本原則加強抽查各部門採購時的盡職審查工作，並適時上報有關部門首長正視；

（三）修訂《招標和合約的標準條款》加強審查和管理合約權力：為加強政府在招標和合約管理方面的權力，物流署今日已修訂《招標和合約的標準條款》，當中涵蓋規定投標者和承辦商須同意政府可直接向第三方核實所提交資料的真確性，並容許政府在審核標書過程和合約期間進行實地視察等。經修訂的條款亦賦權政府在發現承辦商提交虛假陳述或不真確資料時，可即時終止合約；

（四）設立電子資料庫共享資訊：採購工作並不限於物流署，各部門也會自行採購服務和產品。為善用不同部門的採購經驗，物流署十月中已設立內部電子資料庫，持續蒐集各部門有關承辦商投標情況和合約表現的資訊，構建整個政府通用的採購資訊網，供採購人員隨時查閱，從而更有效及早識別高風險投標者；

（五）加強人員培訓防範詐騙：物流署聯同香港警務處和香港海關在九月舉辦了五場講座，重點向各部門負責採購和財務工作的人員講解騙案手法和識別技巧，提升他們的防騙意識，共有逾750人次參加。另外，物流署亦正安排培訓班，向同事詳細講解新訂立的內部工作指引，讓他們能掌握執行細節；及

（六）建立主人翁工作文化：採購工作需有規則依從，但人員的妥善執行亦至關重要。在構思及落實各項措施時，物流署透過不同渠道鼓勵同事提出意見，當中包括在九月舉行兩場員工交流會，聽取他們對做好盡職審查工作和程序的意見，務求他們對各項優化措施有更強的參與感和承擔，從而建立主人翁工作文化。物流署會繼續透過入職培訓、恆常培訓活動和員工交流會等，將「盡職盡心，採購為民」的主人翁工作文化逐步植根同事心中，令他們視政府採購尤如己事，更積極更謹慎。

專責小組正研究一些牽涉面更廣的方案，並預期在今年年底前發表檢討報告，提出達致「表裏兼顧、標本兼治」的方案，讓政府採購工作更臻完善。

此外，物流署正檢視供應政府辦公室樽裝飲用水合約招標要求的細節。為了在招標前更準確掌握市場脈搏，物流署今日已在其網頁公布市場研究公告，邀請有興趣的供應商在一個月內提交回應。物流署考慮有關回應後，目標在今年年底為供應樽裝飲用水予港島和部分離島政府辦公室展開招標工作。

許正宇今日亦公開審計署就審查採購樽裝飲用水招標過程所提交的管理建議書（見附件）。他感謝審計署提出不少建議，並指出建議與上述六項先行措施和專責小組正研究的長遠優化方案方向一致。專責小組會詳細研究管理建議書，以完善年底前提出的長遠優化方案。

許正宇也公布，已邀請首長級甲一級政務官劉焱就管理建議書內所點出的人為疏漏情況進行紀律調查。

檢討政府採購機制專責小組於八月成立，以跨政策局、跨部門形式，從政府採購樽裝飲用水的事件出發，審視現有的政府採購機制和程序。專責小組由許正宇擔任主席，成員包括財庫局常任秘書長（庫務）、物流署署長，以及公務員事務局、商務及經濟發展局、發展局和律政司的代表。"
Government implements quick-win measures to plug procurement loopholes and releases Audit Commission's management letter,2025-10-20 14:45,2025-10-20 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000285.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, announced today (October 20) that the Government Logistics Department (GLD) had implemented six quick-win measures focusing on three aspects, namely institutional change, enhancement of cross-departmental information exchanges and reshaping of work culture, as proposed by the Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime (Task Force) to plug loopholes in government procurement procedures as soon as possible. Furthermore, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) released in full the management letter submitted by the Audit Commission on its review of the incident on the Government's procurement of bottled drinking water to demonstrate the Government's transparency in handling the incident and its commitment to revamp its procurement and contract management regime.

Mr Hui said, ""While the incident on the procurement of bottled drinking water clearly involved suspected fraudulent acts by a particular company, it also revealed that the perceptiveness and alertness of the relevant officers in conducting due diligence checks and addressing potential fraudulent acts could not adapt to the current business environment and were obviously below reasonable expectations. The Task Force and I consider it essential to tackle the problem at source through reshaping the work culture, enhancing the capability of procurement officers in exercising due diligence and empowering officers with sufficient authorities on the regime level. This will help ensure greater effectiveness for officers in handling procurement matters in future, not only serving as advocates of fair competition, but more importantly, as gatekeepers for government procurement.""

He stated that the Task Force, since its establishment in August, had been exploring measures to enhance the tendering and procurement regime and procedures. Among them, the Task Force considered that six quick-win measures should be launched sooner to plug loopholes at the earliest time. The FSTB has directed the GLD to implement these six measures immediately. Details are as follows:

(1) Promulgate internal guidelines to stipulate specific requirements on due diligence checks: The GLD issued an internal memorandum to government officers in late August to remind them of the aspects in the procurement and contract management processes which require proper due diligence checks. The GLD further promulgated today internal operational guidelines which set out specific requirements and provide detailed guidelines on conducting due diligence checks at various stages, including preparation of tender documents, tender evaluation and contract management, to help procurement officers guard against potential fraudulent acts more effectively;

(2) Set up a Procurement and Stores Management Audit Section to step up inspections: The GLD has expanded the functions of its original internal audit team and reorganised it into the Procurement and Stores Management Audit Section starting from October. As a dedicated team for conducting third-party audits, the Section steps up inspections of due diligence work on departments' procurements under a risk-based approach and reports to the relevant Heads of Departments for attention as appropriate;

(3) Revise Standard Terms and Conditions of Tenders and Contracts (STC) to strengthen vetting and contract management power: The GLD has revised the STC today to strengthen the Government's power in tendering and contract management, including requiring tenderers and contractors to give consent to the Government for verifying directly with third parties the authenticity of information submitted, allowing the Government to conduct site visits during the tender evaluation process and throughout the contract period, etc. The revised STC also empowers the Government to terminate contracts immediately if contractors are found to have made material misrepresentations or provided false information;

(4) Establish a digital database for information sharing: Procurement work is not confined to the GLD, as departments may also procure services and goods on their own. To leverage the procurement experience of departments, the GLD established an internal digital database in mid-October to keep collecting from departments information related to contractors' tendering situations and contract performances. The database serves as a government-wide procurement information portal that can be accessed by procurement officers anytime, assisting them to identify high-risk tenderers in a more effective and timely manner;

(5) Strengthen staff training to guard against fraud: The GLD, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, organised five seminars in September. The seminars, with a total attendance of over 750, focused on introducing scam tactics and identification techniques to officers involved in procurement and finance matters for departments to heighten their anti-fraud awareness. Moreover, the GLD is arranging training courses to brief staff thoroughly on the newly issued internal operational guidelines to assist them to grasp the implementation details; and

(6) Build a culture of ownership at work: While procurement work requires adherence to rules, proper execution by staff is of the utmost importance. In working out and implementing the various measures, the GLD encouraged staff to offer their views through multiple channels, including two staff engagement sessions held in September to gauge feedback on due diligence work and the relevant procedures to foster a greater sense of involvement and commitment in the enhancement measures among staff and build a culture of ownership at work. The GLD will continue to instil the ownership mindset of ""procuring for the people with due diligence and dedication"" in the work culture through induction training, regular training activities and staff engagement sessions, etc, such that staff will take ownership of government procurement and be more proactive and prudent.

The Task Force is considering other proposals involving a broader scope, and expects to publish a review report before the end of this year to put forward solutions that address both symptoms and root causes, with a view to further enhancing the Government's procurement work.

Separately, the GLD is reviewing in detail the tender requirements of the contract for the supply of bottled drinking water to government offices. In order to keep tabs on the market pulse prior to tendering, the GLD published a market research notice on its website today, inviting interested suppliers to submit responses in a month's time. The GLD aims to launch the tender exercise for the supply of bottled drinking water to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands, with the relevant responses taken into account, by the end of this year.

Mr Hui also released today the management letter (at Annex) submitted by the Audit Commission on its review of the tender exercise for the procurement of bottled drinking water. He thanked the Audit Commission for providing numerous recommendations, the directions of which align with the six quick-win measures aforementioned and the long-term enhancement measures being explored by the Task Force. The Task Force will examine the management letter in detail to refine the long-term enhancement measures for announcement before the end of the year.

Mr Hui also announced that Ms Alice Lau, Administrative Officer Staff Grade A1, had been invited to conduct a disciplinary investigation on the human errors identified in the management letter.

The Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime was established in August to review the existing government procurement regime and procedures arising from the incident on the Government's procurement of bottled drinking water under a cross-bureau and cross-departmental approach. The Task Force is chaired by Mr Hui, with members that include the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Treasury), the Director of Government Logistics, and representatives from the Civil Service Bureau, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Development Bureau and the Department of Justice."

 With the iCMS, there is no need to visit the High Court Building to scan (this function is available to Litigants-in-Person only) and upload the electronic copy of the document to be filed using the self-service kiosks located at the Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants or make payments in the Accounts Office for paper filing.

 To facilitate law firms' early migration from conventional paper mode to the iCMS in preparation for mandatory use in 2026, the Judiciary is inviting all law firms to make an appointment with the Judiciary for technical assistance on using the iCMS, either at the High Court Building or their own offices, when they are initiating a new case of an iCMS-enabled case type (including HCPI upon its rollout on October 30) for the first time. Taking into account the law firms' response and available resources, the Judiciary may require all law firms initiating a new case through paper filing to go through this assisted e-filing process for the purpose of enhancing training on iCMS before mandatory e-filing. To encourage migration to the iCMS, a 20 per cent concession is offered to iCMS users for three years on fee items of the High Court that are primarily or directly related to the electronic handling of court documents.

 Eligible users, including parties of ongoing or new e-proceedings and their legal representatives (if any), need to register for a user account to access the full range of services under the iCMS. Unregistered users can only use limited iCMS services, mainly searching for electronic documents that are open to public inspection. Registration is free of charge.
 
 The iCMS can be accessed using personal computers or mobile devices with an Internet connection, commonly used operating systems and browsers. It operates around the clock, except during system maintenance. Any e-filing and e-payment received under the iCMS after the registry and the accounts office are normally closed to the public (i.e. after 5.30pm on a working day) will be deemed to be received at the start of the normal opening hours of the registry and the accounts office on the following working day.

 For more details about the iCMS, including its technical requirements, please visit the dedicated webpage on e-Courts of the Judiciary website at www.judiciary.hk/en/e_courts/index.html.

 For enquiries, please call the general enquiry hotline at 2477 1002 or the technical helpline at 2886 6474, emailenquiry@judiciary.hk, or visit the Help Centre at 5/F, Wanchai Tower, 12 Harbour Road, Wan Chai.

Note: The iCMS application currently covers personal injury actions, tax claim proceedings, civil action proceedings and employees' compensation cases in the District Court, summons cases in the Magistrates' Courts, bulk claims in the Small Claims Tribunal, and selected case types of civil proceedings of the High Court, including civil appeal cases (CACV) in the Court of Appeal and commercial cases (HCCL), construction and arbitration cases (HCCT) and intellectual property cases (HCIP) in the Court of First Instance."
Speech by CE at Inauguration Ceremony of International Organization for Mediation (English only) (with photos/video),2025-10-20 12:20,2025-10-20 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000351.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Inauguration Ceremony of the International Organization for Mediation today (October 20):

Honourable Vice Minister Hua Chunying (Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs), Your Excellencies, representatives of contracting states, ministers and officials from around the world, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am very honoured to join you today, for the inauguration of the International Organization for Mediation.

  I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to my country, China, for its steadfast support; and to the International Organization for Mediation's contracting states and signatory states, for their confidence in Hong Kong, as home to the Organization's headquarters.

  The headquarters is housed in this newly renovated building, a police station for almost a century. The renovation, completed within 14 months, harmoniously blends the building's historic origins with modern design, preserving architectural features, while drawing inspiration from Chinese porcelain.

  More than stone and mortar, this thoughtful transformation embodies the essential spirit of mediation – uniting diverse elements in balance and harmony, creating a place ideally suited for peaceful resolution.

  In these times of global instability, international mediation is indispensable for resolving disputes, preserving relationships and encouraging meaningful co-operation. With our world-class professional services, Hong Kong is dedicated to supporting the cause of dispute resolution.

  Under the unique ""one country, two systems""principle, Hong Kong enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage. We pride ourselves with our established tradition of the rule of law, and a common law regime shared by many global financial hubs. Our three law schools are all ranked within the world's top 60, and nurture outstanding talent in legal and dispute resolution services.

  Our flagship legal event Hong Kong Legal Week, in December, will include a session on international mediation. And in 2026, during Hong Kong Mediation Week, we will organise a global mediation summit, bringing together mediation practitioners, policymakers and thought leaders from around the world.

  We are equally committed to capacity building. The Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, launched last year by our Department of Justice, equips mediators and legal professionals with the skills to meet international standards.

  In my Policy Address last month, I announced the development of the Hong Kong International Legal Service Building, on a site adjacent to us here. It will provide additional facilities for the Organization, and be home to the International Legal Talents Training Academy.

  Ladies and gentlemen, today's inauguration is a testament of our shared commitment to a future in which dialogue, co-operation and mutual respect prevail over acrimony and conflict.

  As I said in May, at the signing of the convention establishing the Organization, Hong Kong builds bridges. We take pride in being a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"". And we are honoured to serve as the Organization's home.

  I am confident that, under the joint dedication of all contracting states and the SecretaryâGeneral's stewardship, the International Organization for Mediation will rise as a respected and trusted body for resolving disputes through mutual respect and understanding.

  I wish the International Organization for Mediation every success.

  Thank you."

Speech by SJ at opening ceremony of Legal Practical Training Course for Chinese Enterprises Going Overseas (English only),2025-10-20 11:48,2025-10-20 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000311.htm,"Following are the opening remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the opening ceremony of the Legal Practical Training Course for Chinese Enterprises Going Overseas today (October 20):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to this Legal Practical Training Course for Chinese Enterprises Going Overseas, organised by the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy of the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government.

First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council of the People's Republic of China (SASAC), especially the SASAC Bureau of Policies, Laws and Regulations for making this course a reality. With the strong support of SASAC, we have the privilege to convene 30 general counsel and senior legal officers from our country's leading state-owned enterprises under one roof. I understand we also invited three senior legal counsel from leading private companies. I also welcome colleagues from the Ministry of Commerce, who are with us here today. I extend my heartfelt thanks to each of you for taking the time to join us in Hong Kong for this course.

Traditionally, Hong Kong has been a springboard for Mainland enterprises to go global. This unique position is rooted in Hong Kong's status under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, making it the only bilingual common law jurisdiction in China where both Chinese and English are official languages. Such distinct advantages enable Hong Kong to act as a ""super connector"" and a significant value-adder between the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world. Hong Kong continues to be the first stop for numerous Chinese companies establishing their overseas bases and seeking IPOs (initial public offerings). In the first half of 2025 alone, Hong Kong's IPO market raised an impressive HK$107.1 billion through 42 listings, marking a 700 per cent increase in funds raised and a 40 per cent rise in deal volume. This extraordinary performance positions Hong Kong as the top global fundraising hub, reinforcing its pivotal role as an international financial centre and a gateway for Chinese enterprises' global expansion.

As our country transforms from rapid growth to high-quality development, more and more outstanding Mainland enterprises are actively expanding to overseas markets. However, this new phase of global expansion also presents challenges. Chinese enterprises face increasing geopolitical uncertainties, diverse regulatory environments, and increasing compliance demands across different markets. Supply chain complexities and cost pressures continue to test operational resilience. Furthermore, adapting to local legal, cultural, and economic conditions remains critical for sustainable success.

Under these circumstances, the roles of legal counsel of enterprises have become more critical than a mere advisor or head of a legal division traditionally in the past. Nowadays, legal counsel often have to play the role as an architect of risk management framework, as a gatekeeper of compliance, and as a compass directing strategic decision-making for the enterprises or organisations as a whole. Legal counsel have to operate at the intersections of law, policy, and business, where your advice has direct implications on economic security and corporate reputation. This course is therefore profoundly important, as it aims to equip you with the cutting-edge knowledge and practical skills that will enable you to guide your enterprises or organisations towards sustained excellence and growth.

As announced in the Policy Address 2025 last month, the Chief Executive has highlighted the significant role of Hong Kong's legal services sector in supporting Mainland enterprises. Our Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Horace Cheung, is specifically tasked to promote Hong Kong's legal services and collaborate with other professional sectors, including accounting and finance, to provide robust support for Mainland enterprises aspiring to expand overseas. This course arrives at just the right time to take forward this very important initiative under the Policy Address.

We hope that this course could provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the current trends in overseas expansion, the evolving legal and regulatory challenges, the best practices for compliance and practical tools for navigating these complexities. We will delve into critical areas such as mergers and acquisitions, export control and sanctions, compliance, international commercial and investment arbitration, international trade instruments and regulations, transaction and dispute resolution involving sovereign states, intellectual property international strategies as well as hot topics such as stablecoins. In addition, we will have dedicated regional panels focusing on Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa respectively, where we invited 13 senior practitioners from 12 jurisdictions, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Vietnam to share their first-hand experience and local insights. I encourage you to actively interact with these panelists and share your experience with them, including any difficulties or challenges that you have faced or may face in these regions. We will also explore case studies to illustrate some critical legal and strategic issues.

We hope that by the end of this course, you will be well positioned to leverage Hong Kong's unique legal and dispute resolution advantages. We encourage you to make use of Hong Kong's robust legal infrastructure, wealth of expertise and world-class legal services as key resources to support and enhance your enterprises' overseas endeavours.

Beyond acquiring technical knowledge, this course also provides a unique opportunity to build and strengthen connections among peers facing similar challenges. We believe that, by sharing your insights and experiences with one another, you will be able to build a strong network that helps each of you grow professionally and enriches the collective wisdom that drives our success during times of uncertainty under the rapidly changing international landscape.

Before I end, I would like to take a moment to introduce the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, which will soon be approaching its first anniversary. Since its launch last November, the Academy has co-organised a number of training programmes in Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and abroad, covering a variety of topics and targeting a wide spectrum of participants. Through organising practical legal courses, seminars and international exchange programmes, the Academy promotes international legal talent exchanges. This will help to consolidate Hong Kong's strategic position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region, establish Hong Kong as a capacity-building hub, and actively participate in the next decade of the Belt and Road Initiative, contributing to the country's efforts to promote the construction of the rule of law. I thank you all for your valuable support of the Academy thus far, and warmly encourage your continued engagement and collaboration with the Academy.

The Department of Justice will be hosting its annual flagship event, the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025, from December 1 to 5 this year. It is a fruitful week filled with opportunities to connect, learn, and engage with eminent legal minds from around the world. On December 1, the Academy will co-organise the 6th UNCITRAL Asia-Pacific Judicial Summit 2025 - Judicial Conference together with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). Themed ""Building towards End-to-End Digitalization"", this judicial conference will explore topics related to the application of digital economy, virtual assets, artificial intelligence and technology in the judicial field. On December 2, we will co-organise The Third Legal Forum on Interconnectivity and Development with the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR. On December 3, the Academy will co-organise A Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific on Private International Law with the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Prominent international speakers such as the Secretary-General of international organisations and prominent overseas experts will be speaking at these events. They will certainly give you valuable insights and provide you with abundant opportunities to engage in meaningful discussions with these experts. You are warmly invited to participate in these events, as well as the other events focusing on dispute resolution, Greater Bay Area development and rule of law throughout the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

While you are in Hong Kong for this one-week course, I encourage you to take some time to explore the city. Beyond its status as the leading international legal and financial centre, Hong Kong is a vibrant city full of rich culture, delicious cuisine, and stunning sights. I hope you have the opportunity to experience the unique charm of this remarkable city alongside your learning journey.

In conclusion, I wish you all an engaging, insightful and productive experience in the coming week. I look forward to meeting you again during the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025. Thank you."

羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團十一月重臨香江　與國際知名鋼琴家和歌劇演唱家呈獻兩場音樂會（附圖）,2025-10-20 11:00,2025-10-20 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025101600479.htm,"闊別香港七年的羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團將由新任藝術總監兼世界級指揮丹尼奧‧哈汀帶領下於十一月亮相康樂及文化事務署（康文署）的「音樂盛會二○二五」。香港作為樂團本年亞洲巡演首站，兩場演出更分別邀得近年歐美古典音樂界寵兒、著名意大利鋼琴家貝雅斯‧拉娜首度來港合作演出拉威爾的作品，以及三名當今享負盛名的歌劇演唱家壓軸演繹華格納的《女武神》第一幕，樂迷和歌劇迷均不容錯過。

兩場音樂會將以威爾第的大型歌劇《西西里晚禱》的序曲拉開帷幕。首場（十一月二十日）樂團另將與鋼琴家貝雅斯‧拉娜攜手演繹拉威爾的《G大調鋼琴協奏曲》，此曲受爵士音樂和巴斯克民樂風格影響，讓鋼琴與樂團來一場極富節奏感和娛樂性的對話。樂團亦以拉赫曼尼諾夫的《E小調第二交響曲，作品二十七》為該晚演出作結。

次場（十一月二十一日）的選曲均出自歌劇大師之作，包括羅西尼《威廉泰爾》和威爾第《命運之力》的序曲。樂團更將其今個樂季的開幕節目——華格納《指環》四部曲之二《女武神》第一幕的音樂會版本搬到香港演出，並由男高音克勞斯‧弗洛里安‧福茨、女高音米娜—莉莎‧瓦雷萊和男低音延侊哲分別聲演眾神之王伏坦的雙胞胎子女西格蒙和西格琳，以及西格琳的丈夫胡定。在是次亞洲巡演中，樂團僅在香港站上演此音樂會版本。

羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團成立於一九○八年，是意大利第一隊以演奏交響樂曲為宗旨的樂團，首演了多首二十世紀的傑作，其中包括意大利作曲家雷史碧基的《羅馬之泉》和《羅馬之松》。樂團曾與多位音樂大師合作，包括指揮家馬勒、德布西、理查•史特勞斯、史達拉汶斯基、西貝流士、亨德密特、托斯卡尼尼等，亦曾在柏林愛樂音樂廳、森柏歌劇院、維也納的音樂協會和音樂廳等著名音樂廳演出。近年樂團的錄音活動屢獲國際殊榮，當中錄製的浦契尼《杜蘭朵》更獲得國際古典音樂獎「最佳歌劇」獎。

丹尼奧・哈汀現為羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團及合唱團的音樂總監和粵港澳大灣區國際青年音樂周的音樂總監。他指揮馬勒室樂團20餘年，榮獲該樂團終身桂冠指揮頭銜，另擔任了瑞典廣播交響樂團的音樂及藝術總監18年。哈汀亦曾在米蘭史卡拉歌劇院、維也納國家歌劇院、皇家歌劇院、普羅旺斯艾克斯音樂節和薩爾斯堡音樂節等指揮廣受好評的歌劇作品。哈汀於二○○二年獲法國政府授予法國藝術與文學騎士勳章，並於二○一七年獲頒軍官榮譽。

鋼琴家貝雅斯・拉娜於年僅18歲時已在蒙特利爾國際音樂比賽中奪得首獎及所有特別獎項，其後於二○一三范・克萊本國際鋼琴比賽中獲得銀獎及觀眾獎而廣受矚目。二○一五年與羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團合作錄製首張專輯，收錄浦羅歌菲夫《第二鋼琴協奏曲》和柴可夫斯基《第一鋼琴協奏曲》，獲得國際讚譽，並成為《留聲機》雜誌的編輯之選。二○一七年更榮獲《留聲機》雜誌「年度青年藝術家獎」。

米娜—莉莎・瓦雷萊被《歌劇雜誌》盛讚為「戲劇界女高音中最具潛力的新星之一」。她曾於杜達美指揮下與洛杉磯愛樂樂團合作，演繹華格納的《崔斯坦與伊索德》，今年更初登華格納歌劇年度盛事—拜羅伊特歌劇節，表現一鳴驚人。

克勞斯・弗洛里安・福茨憑其別樹一格的歌聲被譽為當代最傑出的華格納男高音之一，以華格納的《羅恩格林》中聖杯武士一角享譽國際，足跡遍及世界各大歌劇舞台，包括大都會歌劇院、皇家歌劇院、維也納國家歌劇院等。他更榮獲OPER! Awards 2025最佳男歌手奬項。

延侊哲是當今備受矚目的低音聲樂家之一，曾於多個國際歌劇舞台演出，包括巴黎歌劇院、維也納國家歌劇院和柏林國立歌劇院等。他於二○一八年獲柏林國立歌劇院授予「榮譽歌手」榮銜，同年獲頒湖巖藝術獎，確立其韓國國寶級演唱家的地位。

「羅馬聖切契利亞管弦樂團」音樂會十一月二十日及二十一日（星期四及五）晚上八時在香港文化中心音樂廳舉行，票價分450元、650元、850元、1,050元、1,250元及1,450元，現於城市售票網（www.urbtix.hk）發售，電話購票請致電3166 1288。同時購買十月至十一月期間的「音樂盛會二○二五」節目門票可享套票優惠。查詢節目詳情及購票優惠，請致電2268 7321或瀏覽www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/tc/music/programs_1836.html。

有關個䅁涉及元朗丈量約份第115約其中兩個地段上一幢四層高面積約100平方米的搭建物。由於有關僭建物不會獲地政總署發出豁免證明書，亦並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署遂根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向該兩名共同業主發出清拆令。他們沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（十月二十日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

The case involved a four-storey unauthorised structure with an area of about 100 square metres on two lots in D.D.115, Yuen Long. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the unauthorised building works (UBWs) and the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the co-owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (October 20), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

The evening will conclude with Rachmaninov's ""Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 27"".

At the award presentation ceremony for the basketball competition, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the Teens and Elderly Mission Committee for their support of this programme, as well as all participating teams for giving their best. He encouraged young people to develop teamwork skills through sports, and more importantly, to stay away from the temptation of drugs and illegal activities. He mentioned that the winning teams will engage in a series of volunteer services to contribute to society and will have the opportunity to visit the Mainland for competitions and exchange programmes. They will gain valuable experience of our country’s development and deepen their understanding of our country.

Youth are now growing up in an increasingly complex environment, shaped by rapid advancements in cyber technology and fraught with various temptations and traps, including the emerging drug etomidate and constantly evolving scam tactics. The success of youth crime prevention efforts is attributed to the sustained deepening of collaboration among all societal stakeholders and the Police. By combining insights and leveraging synergies, crime prevention messages and proper values can be instilled into the moral virtues of communities and young individuals, more broadly and profoundly.

Sponsored by the Hong Kong Jockey Club and launched in June, the JPC Anti-Narcotics and Fight Crime 3x3 Basketball Training Programme 2025 engaged nearly 6000 teachers and students from 66 secondary and primary schools. This year-long initiative delivers anti-drug and crime prevention messages through diverse activities, including basketball training and school talks, fostering positive mindsets among participants.

The basketball competition under the programme attracted 216 teams, comprising around 900 players from nearly 100 secondary and primary schools. The participating teams encompassed diverse ethnic backgrounds and included students from a Greater Bay Area school. Forty-eight elite teams progressed to today’s finals, vying for the championship, runner-up, and third-place positions in four men’s and four women’s divisions, along with accolades for Top Scorer and Most Valuable Player.

Today’s carnival featured 20 game booths on crime prevention themes, providing participants with opportunities to learn about the dangers of drug abuse and the latest scam tactics. The NSpeed National Security Express Promotional Truck was also on site, promoting national security awareness among the public through interactive displays."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-19 17:30,2025-10-19 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101900495.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 19), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 41 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 086 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 12 to 18), showing a decrease compared to the previous week, which reported 2 257 cases (October 5 to 11). Most of the cases (795 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (241 cases), Shenzhen (202 cases) and Guangzhou (189 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââââ
  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：
• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：
• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

76th Anniversary of Founding of People's Republic of China and Mountaineering Safety Promotion Day 2025 held (with photos),2025-10-19 17:20,2025-10-19 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101800401.htm," The Civil Aid Service (CAS) held the 76th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China and Mountaineering Safety Promotion Day 2025 with various government departments and mountaineering organisations today (October 19) at Quarry Bay Park with a view to enhancing public awareness of hiking safety and reducing accidents arising from mountaineering activities.

 Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk, thanked the various disciplined services, auxiliary services and mountaineering organisations for establishing a solid safety net for Hong Kong's outdoor activities. He especially reminded the public that when choosing to hike on dangerous terrain, any accident not only endangers the hiker but also puts rescuers at risk. Therefore, when participating in such high-risk activities, safety must be the primary consideration to ensure the safety of oneself and others.

  Mr Cheuk also stressed that, with the development of the lowâaltitude economy, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the CAS have been studying the use of drones for efficient search and rescue operations. This not only improves rescue efficiency but also reduces the risk to rescuers.

  Then, Mr Cheuk presented certificates of completion to those who had finished the Mountain Casualty Handling Course as well as the Hiking Safety and Mountain Rescue Course.

 The Chief Staff Officer of the CAS, Mr Leung Kwun-hong, also expressed his gratitude to various government departments and organisations for their joint efforts in promoting mountain safety and ensuring the safety of citizens. He said that the FSD, the HKPF, and the Government Flying Service (GFS) have always been important partners of the CAS in mountain search and rescue operations. They have fought side by side with the CAS, successfully rescuing trapped persons and demonstrating a high level of professionalism and selfless dedication.

 Other attending guests included the Director of Operations of the HKPF, Mr Lui Kam-ho; the Deputy Director of Fire Services (Operations), Mr Derek Chan; and the Controller of GFS, Mr Eddie Liu, as well as representatives from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, the Office of the Communications Authority, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Auxiliary Medical Service, the Lands Department, and various mountaineering organisations.

 The promotion day featured booth games designed to raise awareness about mountain activity safety. It also showcased a variety of mountain activity equipment and demonstrated techniques for mountain search and rescue as well as handling injured individuals, allowing the public to gain a better understanding of the work involved in mountain rescue operations.

  A special highlight of the event was the opportunity for citizens to take photos with working dogs from the various disciplined forces, sharing a fun experience together."

保安局副局長卓孝業在開幕禮致辭時，感謝各部隊及山嶺機構為香港山野活動建立了穩固的安全網。他特別提醒市民，當選擇在地勢險要的山徑行山時，一旦發生意外，除了自身面臨危險外，也會將救援人員置於險境。因此，參與這類高風險活動時，必須以安全為首要考慮，確保自己及他人的安全。

卓孝業亦強調，隨着低空經濟的發展，香港警務處、消防處和民安隊已積極研究利用無人機進行高效搜救。除了提升救援效率，更減少了救援人員的風險。

其後，卓孝業頒發結業證書予完成「山嶺傷者處理課程」及「登山安全及攀山搶救課程」的學員。

民眾安全服務處總參事梁冠康亦感謝各政府部門及團體攜手推動山嶺安全，保障市民安全。他說，消防處、香港警務處以及政府飛行服務隊在山嶺搜救行動中一直是民安隊的重要夥伴，與民安隊並肩作戰，成功救援被困人士，展現出高度的專業精神與無私奉獻。

其他出席嘉賓包括香港警務處行動處處長呂錦豪、消防處副處長（行動）陳慶勇、政府飛行服務隊總監廖嘉俊，以及漁農自然護理署、通訊事務管理局辦公室、香港天文台、康樂及文化事務署、醫療輔助隊、地政總署和多個山嶺活動團體的代表。

推廣日設置攤位遊戲以提升山嶺活動安全意識，並展出各式各樣的山嶺活動器材，以及示範了山嶺搜救和處理傷者的技術，讓市民了解山嶺搜救的工作。

大會更特別安排了市民與各紀律部隊的工作犬合照，與市民同樂。"
