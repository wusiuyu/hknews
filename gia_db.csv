政務司副司長出席共創銀髮未來論壇致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-08-02 16:36,2025-08-02 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200644.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（八月二日）出席共創銀髮未來論壇的致辭：

振昇主席（港九勞工社團聯會主席林振昇）、小松秘書長（港九勞工社團聯會秘書長周小松）、黃傑龍主席（僱員再培訓局主席）、管浩鳴主席（香港社福界心連心大行動主席）、盧金榮會長（香港中華廠商聯合會會長）、各位分享嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天很高興出席共創銀髮未來論壇。感謝港九勞工社團聯會（勞聯）籌辦今日的活動，搭建了一個聚焦於銀髮經濟的交流平台，匯聚相關專家和有識之士，共同探討如何為香港的銀髮族創造更美好的未來。

面對人口結構轉變的新形勢，我們必須積極應對高齡化帶來的各種挑戰，並在挑戰中抓住發展機遇。行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》提出成立由我擔任組長的促進銀髮經濟工作組（工作組）。早前，工作組公布了30項措施，涵蓋五大範疇，包括：促進「銀色消費」、發展「銀色產業」、推廣「銀色品質保證」、推廣「銀色財務及保障安排」及釋放「銀色生產動力」。我很高興見到業界及持份者反應積極，陸續舉辦不同推廣活動和研討會，甚至成立與銀髮經濟相關的團體，促進跨領域合作，推動銀髮經濟蓬勃發展。

在釋放「銀色生產動力」方面，僱員再培訓局（再培訓局）是我們的重要合作夥伴，為年長人士提供多元化的培訓服務。在工作組的號召下，再培訓局已為50歲或以上人士推出更多切合他們需要的措施，包括優先培訓顧問諮詢服務，協助他們多了解及報讀課程；以及推出更多專設的培訓課程，鼓勵他們投身人力需求殷切的行業。

在就業支援方面，勞工處於去年七月推出為期三年的「再就業津貼試行計劃」（「再就業計劃」），鼓勵40歲或以上人士重投就業市場。計劃的反應相當不俗，截至今年六月已錄得超過45 000名參加者及接近23 000宗就業個案。勞工處亦推行「中高齡就業計劃」，鼓勵僱主聘請40歲或以上人士，並提供在職培訓，讓中高齡人士提升工作技能。

為配合工作組釋放「銀色生產動力」的目標，勞工處今年將舉辦約60場適合中高齡人士的專題招聘會，較去年的場次增加一倍，並將於明年第一季就「再就業計劃」和「中高齡就業計劃」進行檢討，進一步促進年長人士就業。

銀髮經濟的發展不單止限於鼓勵銀髮就業，還涉及到整個經濟的轉型，在消費、餐飲、科技產品以至金融產品等方面都帶來變化。工作組希望透過不同措施，引導商界積極擁抱市場變化，在銀髮經濟中尋找新機遇，從而推動整體經濟增長。就促進「銀色消費」方面，政府通過推廣長者飲食、展覽及零售優惠、電子商貿等，協助業界把握銀髮市場的潛力，同時提升長者的生活質素。另外，我們銳意發展「銀色產業」，透過推動樂齡產品的市場化及產業化，增強與樂齡科技的供求對接，拓展市場。同時，我們亦致力與金融業界推廣「銀色財務及保障安排」，提升長者財務上的保障，讓他們能安享晚年。

我期待社會各界共同努力，抓緊銀髮經濟帶來的商機。本港高齡人士的智慧和經驗是社會的寶貴財富，我鼓勵銀髮朋友在退休後繼續發揮所長，積極參與社會和經濟活動，活出另一段精彩的人生。

最後，我預祝今天的論壇圓滿成功，希望所有參與者都能夠收穫豐富。多謝大家。"

尊敬的周霽主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任）、王曦常委（十五運會組織委員會副主任兼秘書長、廣東省委常委）、霍震霆會長（中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會會長）、馮馬潔嫻會長（中國香港殘疾人奧委會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位市民：

大家好！歡迎各位今日來到香港單車館，共同見證第十五屆全國運動會和第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會進入倒數100日的重要時刻。

全運會和殘特奧會是國家最高規格的綜合體育盛事，今屆首次由粵港澳三地聯合承辦，彰顯國家對粵港澳大灣區協同發展的堅定支持，推動香港更全面融入國家發展大局。香港可以和廣東、澳門共同承辦這項全國盛事，讓我們深感光榮、責任重大。

自籌備工作啓動以來，香港特區始終秉持「綠色、共享、開放、廉潔」的辦賽理念，與廣東省及澳門特區政府緊密協作，以最高標準推進各項準備工作，一同將這屆全運會和殘特奧會辦成「簡約、安全、精彩」的體育文化盛會。

在過去一年，香港順利完成了全運會八個競賽項目和兩個跨境項目的測試賽，以及殘特奧會四個競賽項目的賽前演練。從在維多利亞公園搭建臨時沙灘排球場地，到啟德體育園的世界級場館設施開幕啓用，到確保跨境賽事的無縫銜接，到為殘疾運動員提供無障礙服務──每一場測試、每一場演練，都展示香港舉辦盛事的豐厚實力。

未來100天，我們將聚焦優化競賽流程、細化服務安排、強化安全保障，以及做好各個場地和情境的最後測試和演練，為運動員構建公平的競技舞台，為觀眾創造難忘的觀賽體驗。香港會充分發揮國際化和專業化優勢，以專業的團隊協作、嚴謹的賽事組織、人性化的服務細節，為國家體育強國建設，貢獻香港力量、貢獻灣區力量，向世界講好中國體育故事。

體育促進人民健康，更推動社會共融。我們在過去數星期，在全香港徵集了22 000人次的運動里數，不同的市民以步行、跑步、單車等各種方式，總共完成了99萬多公里的距離，今日我們會為「全民共創百萬公里大挑戰」進行最後的100公里衝線環節，共創100萬公里的運動距離，以最熱烈的體育力量，一同迎接全運會和殘特奧會。

還有100天，香港的運動員將會參與全國最高級別的體育競賽，在大灣區主場與各地健兒切磋競技；還有100天，香港的場館將會綻放最耀眼的璀璨光芒，迎接四海健兒的矯健風采；還有100天，香港的市民就可以以最熱情的好客之道，歡迎八方賓客在賽場內外體驗香港；還有100天，香港與廣東、澳門的同心協力，就會為大灣區體育傳奇譜寫新的篇章！

各位，香港將以賽事為紐帶，進一步推動大灣區體育產業聯動發展，拓展青少年體育交流，讓更多市民包括殘疾人士感受體育的平等與包容。就讓我們以倒計時100天為起點，攜手並肩、全力以赴，向全國人民宣告：香港，準備好了！

我在此祝願國家體育事業蒸蒸日上，並祝願第十五屆全運會和殘特奧會圓滿成功！多謝大家！"

Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-08-02 11:51,2025-08-02 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200447.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 2) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
僱主應與僱員訂立熱帶氣旋或暴雨後合理的工作安排,2025-08-02 11:50,2025-08-02 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200441.htm,"勞工處今日（八月二日）提醒僱主應在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告信號取消後為僱員提供合理而切實可行的工作安排，並考慮路面、交通及其他情況，彈性處理僱員復工或遙距工作的安排（如適用）。這有助維持良好的勞資關係，並確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢。

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

僱主僱員應訂立暴雨警告下的工作安排,2025-08-02 09:16,2025-08-02 09:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200295.htm,"勞工處今日（八月二日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在暴雨警告下及極端情況及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以保障僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主應預先制定合理而可行的工作安排和應變措施。在擬訂及執行有關安排時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮當中的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在暴雨警告或極端情況下及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-08-02 09:16,2025-08-02 09:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200294.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 2) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

勞工處發言人今日（八月二日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 2) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

EEB meets with trade representatives on the latest situation of chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-08-01 22:09,2025-08-01 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100938.htm," The Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) today (August 1) met with trade representatives on mosquito and pest control matters, to share with them the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF) and related counter measures and to strengthen co-operation among the Government, businesses and the community while encouraging various sectors to continue to adopt effective mosquito prevention and control measures so as to safeguard public health.

 The EEB has all along been concerned about the latest situation of CF and relevant preventive and control measures. The EEB has been collaborating with various government bureaux and departments and stakeholders of different trades to actively follow-up on mosquito prevention and control work. This morning, the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, Assistant Director (Operations) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) Mr Peter Poon and representatives from related departments visited Po Lam Estate, Po Tsui Park and their nearby areas in Tseung Kwan O before the meeting, to inspect the enhanced efforts to prevent CF in the community.

 The survey area inspected today recorded gravidtrap indices reaching Level 3 alert level in May this year, indicating extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The FEHD has been collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to continuously strengthen mosquito prevention and control work in areas under their purview, including eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and ensuring that mosquito trapping devices at appropriate locations are operating properly. The gravidtrap indices for this survey area in June and July have dropped to Level 2.

 The Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, together with representatives from the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health and the FEHD, met trade representatives this afternoon to brief them the latest situation of CF, the current situation in places outside Hong Kong, collaboration on disease prevention and control between the Mainland and Hong Kong, as well as risk assessment of Hong Kong, control measures at boundary control points, emergency preparedness, publicity and education efforts, etc.

 The representative of the FEHD reported to the meeting the most updated situation of gravidtrap indices. As at July this year, the gravidtrap indices for Aedes albopictus in June was 9.5 per cent, which was lower than the same period in 2023 and 2024 (16.4 per cent and 14.0 per cent respectively), with the overall situation remained at a relatively low level. From January 1 to July 31 this year, the gravidtrap indices in seven surveyed areas were higher than 20 per cent, reaching Level 3 alert level, indicating extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Based on the latest gravidtrap Index for Aedes albopictus, the FEHD, together with relevant government departments and stakeholders, has implemented targeted mosquito prevention and control measures. They continuously strengthen efforts under their purview, primarily focusing on environmental management to reduce mosquito breeding sites, supplemented by biological and chemical methods to kill mosquito larvae or adult, as well as eliminating adult mosquitoes in their habitats (such as dense bushes) by conducting fogging operations. The FEHD also provides technical advice and guidance to reduce the number of Aedes albopictus in densely populated areas, thereby lowering the risk of diseases transmitted by these mosquitoes. The gravidtrap indices in the seven surveyed areas have also shown a decline.

 To prevent the spread of CF, the FEHD has actively implementing the following mosquito control measures:


Convening special meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to co-ordinate frontline departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito control, and to allocate resources to carry out targeted and sustained mosquito control actions based on the gravidtrap index and locations with higher risks;
Enhancing inspections at construction sites, works areas and private residences. Enforcement actions will be taken against violations involving mosquito breeding;
Collaborating with departments such as the Housing Department (HD) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to strengthen inspections in public areas, public housing estates and parks. Upon detection of mosquito breeding grounds, immediate actions will be taken;
Inviting the HD and property management companies to conduct mosquito control campaigns in housing estates and encourages resident participation;
Working with the District Offices to assist in mosquito prevention and control at locations with infestation issues, such as ""three-nil"" buildings;
Issuing letters to the property management and pest control industry to remind them the implementation of mosquito prevention and control measures, and organising seminars to disseminate the latest information on CFand mosquito prevention;
Strengthening public education and publicity through promotional videos, posters and leaflets to remind the public to adopt mosquito control measures; and
Enhancing dissemination of the Area Gravidtrap Index for Aedes albopictus to raise awareness among citizens in districts with higher readings.


âIn addition to the introduction of effective mosquito prevention and control measures by the FEHD, Link and the Hong Kong General Building Contractors Association also shared experience on mosquito prevention by slideshows. Participants will continue to motivate their members and staff to enhance mosquito prevention and control measures after the meeting, as well as to display the Government's publicity and education materials at their venues.

 Representatives from different sectors (including markets/licensed hawkers, property management, catering, construction, hotels and camping) presented mosquito prevention and control measures in the meeting, and expressed they will share the relevant information with other stakeholders.

 The effectiveness of mosquito control relies on the concerted efforts and active participation of stakeholders from various sectors, including pest control operators in both public and private sectors, venue management and the general public. The Government will continue to collaborate with stakeholders and the industry to prevent CF.

 The meeting, chaired by Miss Wong, was attended by representatives from 18 organisations or institutions, including:

(a) stakeholders participating regularly: The Hong Kong Housing Society, Link, People's Place, the Hong Kong Property Services Alliance, the Hong Kong Association of Property Management Companies, the Hong Kong Association of Property Services Agents, the Hong Kong Institute of Housing, the Pest Control Personnel Association of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Pest Management Association, the Federation of Hong Kong, Kowloon, New Territories Hawker Associations, the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, the Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management, the Institute of Dining Professionals, the Association of Restaurant Managers, the Hong Kong Japanese Food and Cuisine Association, the Hong Kong General Building Contractors Association; and

Booking arrangements for Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles to be enhanced to provide convenience for flexible travel,2025-08-01 21:28,2025-08-01 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100928.htm," The Transport Department (TD) announced today (August 1) that, to provide convenience to members of the public in travelling under Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles (the Scheme) more flexibly, the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong have after discussion mutually agreed to enhance the booking arrangements for travelling under the Scheme.

 A spokesman for the TD said, ""From September 1, 2025 onwards, bookings will not be required for vehicles travelling to Guangdong Province via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) under the Scheme on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, except specified dates. Booking is required on specified dates, including Hong Kong or Mainland public holidays and the day before, toll-free days of the HZMB and other dates specified by the authority. Booking is also required on Mondays and Thursdays to Sundays. The Scheme's eligibility, application procedures and balloting remain unchanged.""

 The TD will update the website later to set out dates in the coming six months when bookings are not required. Dates in the following month when bookings are not required will be announced on the first calendar day of each month via the Specified Dates Booking System for applicants' reference. Existing arrangements of accepting bookings for specified dates in the following month from the 15th calendar day of each month will also remain unchanged.

 Of note, travellers planning to travel on specified dates are required to complete the reservation before noon on the day before travel via the Specified Dates Booking System, so that they may travel during the reserved time slot. To ensure the Scheme's smooth operations, if any vehicle is found travelling on specified dates without prior reservation, travelling beyond the reserved time slot or absent after booking, the TD will strictly enforce the penalty, including suspension of its booking eligibility for a period of time, revocation of its Closed Road Permit (CRP), or even suspension of the CRP holder's eligibility to re-apply for the Scheme.

 The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong will continue to monitor the Scheme's operations and maintain close liaison to review and enhance its arrangements in a timely manner. Applicants may refer to the Scheme's thematic website (www.hzmbqfs.gov.hk) for details later."
Health Bureau responds to enquiries regarding Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme,2025-08-01 21:18,2025-08-01 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100915.htm,"  In response to media enquiries regarding the Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme, the Health Bureau provides the following response today (August 1):

  The Government launched the three-year CDCC Pilot Scheme in November 2023, subsidising Hong Kong residents aged 45 or above without diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) or hypertension (HT) to be paired with family doctors for DM and HT screening services in the private healthcare market to achieve the policy objective of ""early prevention, early identification and early treatment"". In March this year, the Pilot Scheme was expanded to include blood lipid testing, achieving full coverage of the ""three highs"". Participants diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT, or hyperlipidaemia after screening can proceed to the treatment phase and will be subsidised by the Government to continue their treatment with a family doctor of their choice, and subject to their health conditions, be provided with prescribed medication and dedicated nurse clinic and allied health services. The Pilot Scheme reinforces the ""Family Doctor for All"" concept and expands the community healthcare network through the District Health Centres (DHCs)/DHC Expresses as resources hubs.

  The CDCC Pilot Scheme has been well received since its launch. Halfway through its three-year pilot phase, over 140000 citizens have already enrolled (as of July 23, 2025), and the number of participants continues to rise. It is expected that the target of having around 200 000 participants during the pilot period can be achieved earlier than expected. Currently, among the approximately 35 600 participants diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT, or hyperlipidaemia, over 95 per cent of them had chosen to continue receiving follow-up treatments from their family doctors.

  The Government commissioned a local university in the first quarter of 2024 to conduct a study to assess the progress in meeting various targets and the overall performance of the Pilot Scheme. Preliminary analysis indicated that participants' health conditions improved overall after receiving health counseling and medical treatment under the Pilot Scheme. Statistics revealed that after six months of participating in the Scheme, the average glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of participants diagnosed with DM dropped by about 1.0 per cent, while the average systolic blood pressure of participants diagnosed with HT decreased by about 15.0 mmHg. The findings demonstrated the positive effects of continual health management and professional support on disease control. The study team recruited a total of 614 participants from 18 DHCs/DHC Expresses for a questionnaire survey. Survey results showed that participants were satisfied with the Pilot Scheme; the overall satisfaction score was 82.5 (out of 100), and the satisfaction score towards the first family doctor consultation service was 76 (out of 100). Furthermore, in terms of HT and DM management, 96.1 per cent of participants with HT and 98.0 per cent of participants with DM reported imrpovements in self-health management capabilities.

  To address the primary healthcare needs of the underprivileged groups, the Government expanded the CDCC Pilot Scheme to selected General Out-patient Clinics (GOPCs) under the Hospital Authority (HA) in phases since late March this year, providing screening and management services of the ""three highs"" (DM, HT and hyperlipidaemia) for the underprivileged groups (including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above, or holders of valid Certificate for Waiver of Medical Charges). The first phase of the service was launched in seven GOPCs in late March 2025 and extended to 14 GOPCs in the end of June 2025 to provide the relevant services. The Government and the HA are planning to extend the services to have GOPCs in all 18 districts to provide the relevant services by the end of this year.

  The Government is reviewing the Pilot Scheme's effectiveness and optimisation strategies, and will expand the Scheme based on the experience gained from the pilot phase, with a view to deepening the initiative by transforming it into a CDCC Platform. The Government will use hepatitis B screening and management as a pilot arrangement, leveraging the Platform to further expand and integrate primary healthcare services, and gradually extend it to cover more types of chronic diseases having regard to considerations such as scientific evidence and resource utilisation. More health empowerment elements and preventive care programmes will also be added to establish a more systematic and coherent integrated primary healthcare community network."

Honourable Consul General Ong Siew Gay (Consul General of Singapore in Hong Kong),Chairman Lawrence Chia (Chairman, Singapore Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong)), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. I'm honoured to be here at the SG60 Gala Dinner organised by the Singapore Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong) to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Singapore.

This year also marks the 35thanniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Singapore and China. This milestone gives another meaning and significance to this year's celebration.

Just two days ago, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR Government attended Singapore's 60th National Day Reception and underlined the deep and long-standing ties that bind our two economies, our two cultures and peoples.

Hong Kong and Singapore have long enjoyed close and cordial bilateral trade and economic relations. To note, Singapore is Hong Kong's fourth-largest trading partner and our largest ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) partner in merchandise trade, as well as the fifth-largest destination of our outward investment. The fact that the Chief Executive led a high-level business delegation to Singapore two years ago highlights the importance we place on strengthening our partnership with Singapore.

Hong Kong is keen to contribute further to regional integration through our early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). We are encouraged by the favourable responses we have received from RCEP members, and we are grateful to Singapore for lending support to our formal accession request.

I look forward to much more collaboration between Hong Kong and Singapore down the road. Under the great concept of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong, being a Special Administrative Region of China, benefits from national programmes such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. At the same time, Hong Kong has been accorded the position of the ""eight centres"" in the National 14th Five-year Plan, which has opened up a whole host of new opportunities for various industries in Hong Kong, ranging from finance, I&T, trade, aviation, logistics to arts and cultures. These opportunities are not only for Hong Kong, but are also open to overseas companies - including of course Singapore companies - which can use Hong Kong as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world.

Singapore and Hong Kong bear a lot of resemblance. We are geographically small, and our population is not big. What's more is that our people are hardworking and possess characteristically good entrepreneurial spirit and a global perspective. And we are good-natured and friendly people. I have no doubt the friendship between Singapore and Hong Kong will grow stronger and stronger, for us to shine together, today and tomorrow.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take the opportunity to bid farewell, once again, to Consul-General Ong Siew Gay, who will be returning to Singapore next week. Siew Gay, you have been such a dear friend and partner, not only to the Hong Kong SAR Government but also to the whole Hong Kong community. Thank you for your immense contribution, and we wish you the best in your new journey.

Tonight, with dinner, wine, dancing and entertainment, as well as a charity auction and lucky draw, and even a supper of Singaporean hawker fare, this will surely be a night to remember.

  So, enjoy the party. Best wishes to Singapore and Singaporeans in Hong Kong! Thank you very much."

醫務衞生局回應有關「慢病共治計劃」的查詢,2025-08-01 20:02,2025-08-01 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100866.htm,"就傳媒有關「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」）的查詢，醫務衞生局今日（八月一日）回應如下：

政府在二○二三年十一月推出為期三年的「慢病共治計劃」，資助45歲或以上未被確診患有糖尿病或高血壓的香港居民，配對家庭醫生並於私營醫療市場接受糖尿病及高血壓篩查服務，以達致「早預防、早發現、早治療」的政策目標。先導計劃於今年三月擴展至包含血脂檢查，實現「三高全覆蓋」。經篩查後被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的參加者可進入治療階段，並在政府資助下由自行選擇的家庭醫生繼續為其診治，以及按個人健康狀況獲處方藥物，接受專屬護士診所和專職醫療服務。先導計劃強化「一人一家庭醫生」概念，並以地區康健中心／站為樞紐，擴闊社區醫療網絡。

「慢病共治計劃」自推出後反應良好，三年先導期一半已有超過14萬名市民參加（截至二○二五年七月二十三日）且參加人數持續上升，預料能較預期時間提早達致先導期約20萬市民參加的目標。目前被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的約35 600位參加者中，超過九成半選擇由家庭醫生繼續跟進治療。

政府已於二○二四年第一季委託本地大學進行研究，評估計劃各項目標的實現程度和整體表現。初步研究分析顯示，參加者在接受計劃安排的醫療輔導和治療後，健康狀況普遍改善。數據顯示，在參與計劃後的六個月，糖尿病患者的平均糖化血紅素（HbA1c）下降約1.0%；高血壓患者的平均收縮壓降低約15.0mmHg，反映持續健康管理和專業支援對疾病控制的積極作用。研究團隊從18間地區康健中心／站招募了614名參與者進行問卷調查。調查結果顯示，參與者對「慢病共治計劃」表現滿意，其中的整體印象評分達82.5分（滿分100分），而首次家庭醫生診症服務的評分則為76分（滿分100分）。此外，在高血壓及糖尿病管理方面，分別有96.1%的高血壓參與者及98.0%的糖尿病參與者在病人自強能力方面有所改善。

為照顧弱勢社群的基層醫療需要，政府於今年三月底分階段擴展「慢病共治計劃」至醫院管理局（醫管局）轄下指定普通科門診診所，為弱勢社群（包括綜合社會保障援助計劃受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受惠人或持有有效醫療費用減免證明書人士）提供「三高」（即高血壓、高血糖和高血脂）篩查和護理服務。首階段服務已於二○二五年三月底在七間普通科門診診所開展，並由六月底起增加至14間普通科門診診所提供相關服務。政府及醫管局計劃於今年底擴展至全港十八區均有普通科門診診所提供有關服務。

政府正展開檢討「慢病共治計劃」的成效及優化的方向，並會以先導計劃的經驗作為基礎而擴大計劃，深化發展為「慢性疾病共同治理平台」（平台）。政府將以乙型肝炎篩查治理為試點，透過平台繼續推展及整合基層醫療服務，根據科學實證和資源運用等考慮因素，逐步覆蓋更多慢性疾病病種，並加入更多健康賦能的元素和預防性護理項目，建立一個更有系統和連貫性的社區基層醫療網絡。"

​律政司司長出席物業管理業監管局「物業守護者」形象設計比賽頒獎典禮暨物業管理業持續專業發展講座致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-08-01 19:29,2025-08-01 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100788.htm,"以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（八月一日）出席物業管理業監管局「物業守護者」形象設計比賽頒獎典禮暨物業管理業持續專業發展講座的致辭：

黃江天博士（物業管理業監管局主席）、各位物管業界朋友、各位嘉賓、各位同事：

大家好，我十分高興今日出席由物業管理業監管局舉辦的「物業守護者」形象設計比賽頒獎典禮暨物業管理業持續專業發展講座。

隨着香港物管業發牌制度全面實施兩周年，我們很高興見證物管業界朝向專業化及優質化的穩步發展。今日，我亦很高興認識新朋友「物管俠」——這位形象鮮明的「代言人」可因應工作需求，化身不同角色，應對各類物管服務。這種靈活變換的設計，象徵着物管從業員因應不同需求提供適切服務的專業精神。

目前，全港已有超過15 000名持牌物管從業員，他們每天穿梭於各區樓宇之間，不僅處理日常管理事務，更需經常擔當着業主、租戶與住戶之間的溝通橋樑，協助化解各類鄰里之間的糾紛。所以我認為今日持續專業發展講座的主題非常配合物管從業員的實際工作需要。這次講座的主題是「物管業界調解樓宇糾紛」。剛剛播放完的短片非常精彩，稍後亦有幾位重量級講者參與專題論壇，分享他們的經驗和真知灼見，我希望先為大家作熱身、「開個頭」。

首先，我認為調解是特別適合處理涉及物業管理的糾紛，這是因為這類糾紛擁有以下四個特點。一是業主、租戶或住戶之間是一個長期持續的關係，不會亦不可能因爭議出現而馬上或短期內終結，簡單來說就是即使有爭執，大家仍然是左鄰右里，「朝見口、晚見面」，如何盡快解決糾紛、修補關係至為重要。事情拖得越久越難解決，因為雙方更容易變得情緒化，失去耐性，亦要為解決糾紛投放更加多時間，甚至金錢。

二是解決這類糾紛往往需要爭議雙方暫且放下對對方的不滿，互相合作。例如樓下住戶投訴樓上單位漏水，雙方都需要同意先讓對方盡早進入自己單位進行必須的檢測，以確定漏水的原因，再尋找雙方均接受的處理方式。

三是這類糾紛大部分不涉及大量金錢，甚至只是一些意氣之爭。例如住戶投訴鄰居在走廊或電梯大堂擺放大量雜物，阻礙出入、有礙觀瞻，甚至影響走火通道。這些爭議不能用錢解決，也不值得花錢解決。

四是這類爭議往往涉及並非黑白分明的簡單問題，而是經常涉及沒有清晰客觀標準的合理性問題。例如住戶投訴鄰居晚上產生噪音，是否構成違反大廈公契及一般法律原則的滋擾，取決於一籃子因素包括造成聲音的原因、音量、持續時間等等因素後，再決定是否構成不合理違法行為。

基於以上物管糾紛的特徵，顯而易見，必須採取非對抗性，經濟、快捷，鼓勵合作，同時修補關係的解決方式。傳統對抗性解決爭議方式例如訴訟或仲裁明顯不適合，相反，調解正正完全符合上述條件。

以調解解決物管糾紛並非新鮮事，早在二○○九年，土地審裁處已發出實務指引，明確鼓勵涉及建築物管理爭議的各方，無論在提出訴訟之前或之後，嘗試透過調解以消除分歧；如爭議本可以藉着比訴訟花費少又更快捷有效的途徑得以解決，而任何一方卻不合理地及不真誠地去嘗試採取此途徑，則審裁處在裁定仲費時會以此行為作為考慮因素。

律政司一直積極推廣以調解解決各類爭議， 例如「調解為先」承諾書活動已成為律政司兩年一度的盛事，旨在鼓勵公司、機構及個人簽署承諾書，承諾先考慮採用調解解決爭議，然後才嘗試其他爭議解決方法或在法庭進行訴訟。至今超過1 000間公司、機構或個人已簽署「調解為先」承諾書，當中包括19間物業管理公司和14名物業管理經理。我亦在此誠邀各位共同響應這項深具意義的倡議，加入簽署「調解為先」承諾書的行列。

更重要是二○二四年《施政報告》確立深化調解文化的長遠政策。為落實深化調解文化的施政方針，律政司聯同環境及生態局和食物環境衞生署共同推出社區調解先導計劃，特別針對物業管理人員設計社區調解培訓課程，將調解理念深入社區。在此，我要特別感謝物業管理業監管局的鼎力支持，協助招募物業管理人員參加培訓課程。計劃的首輪培訓課程已於七月七日正式啓動。

課程由認可調解員教授，內容兼具理論與實務。培訓第一部分的講座向物業管理人員教授調解的基本概念與核心原則，涵蓋調解特性及優點、調解員的角色等課題，並探討在調解過程中應用的不同技巧。課程亦有介紹社會上不同的調解計劃。若物業管理人員嘗試調解後問題依然存在，物管人員可在適當情況下轉介給合適的第三方調解機構。在培訓的第二部分，我們特別設計了情境模擬實務演練，讓學員能夠實際運用所學的調解技巧。課程精心安排了多種常見的社區糾紛案例進行模擬調解，例如住戶拒絕配合滲水初步檢查所引發的衝突，以及因水管維修問題導致的鄰里爭執等實際情境。透過這種高度互動的教學方式，學員得以在仿真的環境中，親身體驗調解過程的各個環節。

計劃自啓動以來，已成功舉辦兩期培訓，共47名人士參與。參與的物業管理人員都展現出高度熱誠，亦對培訓提供了寶貴的意見及作出非常正面的評價。我們計劃在明年三月前再舉辦多四次同樣的培訓。

當物業佔用者之間出現糾紛或對管理有不滿，一般來說，都必定首先找管理處幫忙或作投訴。物管從業員職責所在，無可避免地要嘗試扮演「和事佬」的角色。但是，我認為令物管從業員了解如何以調解方式處理物管糾紛，目的並非要訓練他們成為專業調解員，而是要令他們掌握調解技巧，以便在日常工作中運用協助解決爭議。固然，物管從業員對於相關法律，特別是《建築物管理條例》和有關物業的大廈公契必須有充分認識和理解，但這並不足夠。調解最重要的技巧之一是讓爭議雙方感覺「和事佬」是公正持平，不偏幫任何一方，這樣方能得到雙方的信任，讓他當「和事佬」主持公道，否則就會變成「兩邊不討好」。 其次，「和事佬」必須耐心聆聽雙方陳述，找出真正關鍵爭議點，盡量緩和氣氛，收窄分歧，嘗試提出實際可行解決方案供雙方考慮，將大事化小、小事化無，這需要良好的溝通技巧。

剛才短片中，黃博士提倡的調解「三心兩意」十分有意思，值得點讚。「三心」是同理心、齊心、耐心，「兩意」是誠意加創意。但我比較多心，再送多三個「心」給你們，就是信心、放心和開心。首先，律政司和其他相關部門和團體必定會積極合力提供高質培訓，增加物管從業員處理物管糾紛的信心；大家有信心，必然能更有效履行職責，這樣所有業主、租戶與住戶對物業管理都一定會更放心；自自然然，大家都會在同一大廈或屋苑內不論工作或生活都會變得更開心。

在香港這個崇尚法治的社會，解決物業管理糾紛最終必須依據法律辦事，但要處理的實在是有着密切關連人與人之間的關係。所謂「遠親不如近鄰」，鄰里間和睦相處、保持良好關係十分重要，調解是以「人性化、和為貴、向前看」的原則，修補及維持這一特殊持久關係。我對各位物管從業員充滿信心，相信必定能肩負重任，協助建造一個更和諧的社會和香港。最後，我祝願各位今天能滿載而歸，工作順利，身體健康。謝謝。"
反非法勞工行動拘十六人（附圖）,2025-08-01 18:45,2025-08-01 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100765.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於七月二十八日至昨日（七月三十一日）一連四日在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，分別是代號「促進行動」、「機靈行動」和「曙光行動」，與及聯同香港警務處執行的「風沙行動」。行動中共拘捕十五名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

入境處特遣隊人員在反非法勞工行動中搜查了一百二十八個目標地點，包括工業大廈、住宅單位及餐廳，共拘捕九名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為七男兩女，年齡介乎二十七歲至五十五歲。當中一名女子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為一名五十四歲女子。

此外，在「曙光行動」中，入境處調查人員於網上巡邏期間發現觀塘一間食肆懷疑安排旅客表演舞蹈及雜技，隨即派員於七月二十八日展開行動，在他們於該餐廳進行表演時將其拘捕。被捕的非法勞工為兩男四女，均為內地訪客，年齡介乎二十至二十五歲。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
16 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-08-01 18:45,2025-08-01 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100748.htm,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Contribute"", ""Greenlane"" and ""Twilight"", and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Windsand"", for four consecutive days from July 28 to yesterday (July 31). A total of 15 suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested.

During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD Task Force officers raided 128 target locations including industrial buildings, residential apartments and restaurants. Nine suspected illegal workers and one suspected employerwere arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised seven men and two women, aged 27 to 55. Among them, one woman was a holder of a recognisance form, which prohibits her from taking any employment. One woman, aged 54, was suspected of employing the illegal worker and was also arrested.

 In addition, during operation ""Twilight"", ImmD investigators found during a cyber patrol that a restaurant was allegedly offering dance and acrobatic performances by visitors. Investigators initiated an operation on July 28 immediately and arrested the suspects while they were performing at the restaurant. The arrested illegal workers comprised two men and four women, aged 20 to 25, all Mainland visitors.

An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."

環境及生態局就近期基孔肯雅熱的情況與業界會面（附圖）,2025-08-01 17:55,2025-08-01 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100636.htm,"環境及生態局（環境局）今日（八月一日）就防治蚊蟲事宜與業界代表會面，分享基孔肯雅熱的最新情況及應對措施，加強政商民合作，推動業界積極落實防治蚊患措施，以保障市民健康。

環境局一直關注基孔肯雅熱的最新發展及有關的防控工作，與各決策局及部門和業界持份者通力合作，積極跟進防治蚊患的工作。環境局局長謝展寰今日早上，於會議前先連同食物環境衞生署（食環署）助理署長（行動）潘炳揚及相關部門代表，到將軍澳的寶林邨、寶翠公園及附近一帶，視察地區加強預防基孔肯雅熱的工作。

今日視察的監察地區曾於今年五月錄得誘蚊器指數達第三級警戒級別，代表白紋伊蚊分布廣泛。食環署已聯同相關部門及持份者持續在各自管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊子滋生地、施放殺幼蟲劑、以霧化處理方式殺滅成蚊，以及確保在適當位置設置的捕蚊器妥善運作等。該監察地區其後六月及七月的誘蚊器指數已回落至較低的第二級別。

環境局副局長黃淑嫻聯同衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）人員及食環署人員今日下午與業界代表會面。會上，中心向與會者介紹基孔肯雅熱最新情況、香港以外地方的情況、內地與香港聯防聯控工作，以及香港的風險評估、口岸防控、應急準備及宣傳教育等工作。

食環署亦向與會者匯報最新誘蚊器指數的情況，截至今年七月，白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數曾在六月份錄得9.5%，較二○二三年及二○二四年同期（分別為16.4%及14.0%）為低，整體保持較低水平。在今年一月一日至七月三十一日期間，64個監察地區中，有七個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數曾高於百分之二十，達第三級的警戒級別，表示該監察地區白紋伊蚊的分布廣泛。因應誘蚊器調查結果，食環署已聯同相關部門及持份者採取針對性防蚊滅蚊措施，持續在各自管轄範圍內加強工作，主要以環境防治為基礎以減少蚊子滋生的地點，並輔以生物及化學方式殺滅蚊子幼蟲或成蚊，亦會在成蚊棲息地（例如茂密的叢林）進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，食環署並會提供技術意見及指導，以減低白紋伊蚊在人流密集地方的數量，從而減低經由白紋伊蚊傳播疾病的風險。該七個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數亦見回落。

為防範基孔肯雅熱的傳播，食環署積極採取以下防控蚊患措施：


在各分區召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」特別會議，協調前線部門及各持份者加強滅蚊，根據指數或風險較高的地點，調配資源採取具針對性和持久性的防蚊滅蚊行動；
加強巡查建築地盤及工地，以及私人住宅，對發現蚊子滋生的違規情況採取執法行動；
聯同房屋署及康樂及文化事務署等不同部門在公共地方、公共屋邨、公園等加強巡查，如發現蚊子滋生地，會即時採取行動；
邀請房屋署及物業管理公司在屋邨及屋苑進行滅蚊運動，並鼓勵居民參與；
聯同各區民政事務處，協助有蚊蟲滋生情況的地方如三無大廈進行防蚊滅蚊工作；
已向物業管理及防治蟲鼠業界發信，提醒業界落實防治蚊患的措施，以及通過舉辦講座，向業界講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況及防蚊資訊；
持續加強公眾教育及宣傳，通過宣傳短片、海報及單張等途徑，提醒市民採取措施防治蚊患；及
加強發布各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，提高指數較高地區市民的防蚊意識。


此外，除食環署介紹有效的防治蚊患措施外，領展及香港建築業承建商聯會亦透過其投影片分享其防治蚊患的實戰經驗。與會者在會後將繼續推動其會員及員工做好防治蚊患措施，以及讓政府的宣傳教育資料在其場地展示。

來自不同界別（包括街市／持牌小販、物業管理、餐飲業、建造業、酒店業及營舍業等）的業界代表，在會議上介紹防蚊滅蚊工作，並表示會與其持份者分享有關資料。

防治蚊患要做得好，實有賴各界的持份者，包括公營和私營機構的防治蟲鼠從業人員、場地管理者及市民大眾的通力合作和積極參與。政府會繼續聯同各持份者及業界攜手合作，防範基孔肯雅熱。

是次會議由黃淑嫻主持，共有18個組織或機構參與，包括：

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2025-08-01 17:55,2025-08-01 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100717.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 1) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases and updated the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF). Due to the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, mosquito infestation might be aggravated in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public travel more frequently during summer holidays to regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. As a result, the risks of imported cases and local transmission of mosquito-borne diseases increase.

Dengue fever

From July 25 to yesterday (July 31), the CHP recorded three imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to India, the Philippines and Thailand respectively during the incubation periods.

As of yesterday, 36 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases. In 2023, 62 imported cases of DF were recorded.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 308 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 102 cases were recorded in a week between July 21 and 27, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Yunfu, Foshan and Zhongshan.

Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Chikungunya fever

From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases. There have been no CF cases in Hong Kong since 2020.

According to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of early June this year, over 220 000 cases had been reported in 14 countries/regions worldwide (including the Mainland, Taiwan and Singapore which are popular tourist destinations for Hong Kong citizens). Of these cases, about 80 were fatal. Moreover, according to the information from the Foshan health authority, as of July 30 there were over 6 500 cases. The majority of cases (5 660 cases) were in Shunde District. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases. As well, confirmed cases were also recorded in other cities in Guangdong Province recently. Regarding Macao, six imported cases of CF were recorded since mid-July, and four of them travelled to Foshan city during the incubation periods.

Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been carrying out joint prevention and control of communicable disease involving the three places in accordance with the well-established liaison and communication mechanism. The CHP will continue to work closely with the health authorities in Guangdong Province and Macao, and will take appropriate preventive and control measures according to risk assessment to prevent the spread of CF in Hong Kong and protect public health.

""Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are the most effective measures to protect against mosquito-borne diseases. Members of the public returning from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. Members of the public should closely observe personal health conditions, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrange appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage,"" said the Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au.

The CHP held the first online live seminar yesterday (July 31), to provide the latest information and health advice on CF, and respond to related enquiries from the public. The CHP will hold the second online seminar next week on its Facebook page to talk about anti-mosquito measures and mosquito proliferation. Details will be announced later on the CHP's social media accounts. Members of public are welcome to attend.

The CHP has issued letters to all schools and institutions (including residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities) in Hong Kong to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and remind operators to adopt preventive measures to avoid mosquito bites.

Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:

Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxesin covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Install mosquito screens on windows and doors if necessary, or use mosquito screens or nets in indoor areas;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.
