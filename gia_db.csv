This will fully replace the existing on-site ticketing arrangement, further streamlining application procedures, meeting increasing demand, and ensuring fair and orderly access to services forpersonsin need.

No on-site ticketing for direct issue in coming two days

Due totheabuse of the on-site ticketing arrangement, to prevent queuing for""direct issue""applications from affecting other licensing services while improving order management at the licensing office, the TD willcease theon-site ticketing for""direct issue""applications startingfromtomorrow (January 8). From January 12 onwards, applicants or their agents may obtain tickets online through the ""Online Same-day Queue Ticket"" service.In addition, the existing online appointment booking system for""direct issue""counter services remains unchanged, and applicants who have already booked appointments in advance may continue tovisitthe HKLO at their scheduled times to submit""direct issue""applications.

""Online Same-day Queue Ticket"" arrangement

FromJanuary 12, the TD will open the system at 7amoneach working day to provide 300 same-day tickets. Each ticket allows submission of one""direct issue""application for the designated applicant. Applicants must access the ""Online Same-day Queue Ticket"" system via the designated webpage (www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/licences_and_permits/osqt/index.html) to obtain a ticket on a first-come, first-served basis. Applicants are required to input to thesystemwith information such as the first four digits/characters of the identification document number, English name, and mobile phone number (including numbers registered outside Hong Kong).

Successful applicants will receive SMS notifications sentby#cefs@govhk and have tovisitthe HKLO counter at the specified timeslot stated in the message to submit their applications. Late arrivals or absentees will need to re-apply for a ticket through thesystem. The TD will continue to monitortheapplication demand and adjust the number ofsame-daytickets as necessary.

The ""Online Same-day Queue Ticket"" arrangement is provided with the assistance of the Digital Policy Office (DPO), which aims to facilitate remote same-day ticket collectionby ""direct issue""applicants, eliminating the need for physical queuing and simplifying the application process. The TD willworkcloselywiththeDPO to ensure smooth and stable system operation.

The HKLO willput up notices on the new ""Online Same-day Queue Ticket"" arrangement for ""direct issue"" applications and deploy additional staff to maintain order, answer public enquiries, and provide assistance. Ticketing and queuing arrangements for other driving licence-related counter services remain unchanged.

A TD spokesman stressed that the department has always processed and verified each""direct issue""application in a stringent manner. Applicants must submit sufficient, true and accurate documentary proof and fully meet the eligibility criteria stipulated under the law before approval will be granted.

Towards full online services for""direct issue""applications

Further, the TD is working closely withtheDPO to enhance the online appointment booking system for""direct issue""counter services, including the introduction of new authentication technologies and expansion of system capacity, with a view to fully implementing online appointment booking services as soon as possible and extending ""direct issue"" counter services to the other three Licensing Offices, namely the Kowloon Licensing Office at Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, the Kwun Tong Licensing Office at Kowloon East Government Offices, and the Sha Tin Licensing Office at Sha Tin Government Offices.

In the longer term, the TD is actively exploring the use of artificial intelligence technologies in""direct issue""application procedures. Applicants will be able to upload application documents for preliminary vetting online and only need to bring the original documents to the Licensing Office at their booked timeslot for verification. This will further reducetheneed for submission via agents.TheTD will continue to promote digitalisation of licensing services and announce details of new initiatives in due course."

運輸署就免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照實施「電子即日籌」安排,2026-01-07 18:14,2026-01-07 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700591.htm,"運輸署今日（一月七日）宣布，位於金鐘統一中心的香港牌照事務處將由下星期一（一月十二日）起，就申請免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照（免試簽發）實施「電子即日籌」安排，全面取代現場派籌，以進一步優化申請程序，處理與日俱增的需求，並確保有需要人士公平有序地使用服務。

未來兩日免試簽發不設現場派籌
——————————————

由於有人濫用現場派籌安排，為防止免試簽發的輪候影響其他牌證申請，以及優化牌照事務處的秩序管理，署方將由明日（一月八日）開始取消免試簽發現場派籌安排。申請人或其代理人由一月十二日起可使用「電子即日籌」服務經網上取籌。此外，現有免試簽發網上預約櫃位服務維持不變，早前經網上預約系統提前預約櫃位服務的申請人可繼續按預約時間前往香港牌照事務處辦理免試簽發申請。

「電子即日籌」安排
—————————

由一月十二日起，署方會在每個工作日上午七時開放系統，提供300個即日籌，而每張籌號可辦理一份指定申請人的免試簽發申請。免試簽發申請人須經指定網站（www.td.gov.hk/tc/public_services/licences_and_permits/osqt/index.html）登入「電子即日籌」系統取籌，先到先得。申請人須在系統輸入身分證明文件首四位數字或字母、英文姓名及流動電話號碼（同時接受香港以外的流動電話號碼）等資料。

成功取籌人士會收到以#cefs@govhk發出的電話短訊通知，並須按短訊內的指定時段前往香港牌照事務處櫃位遞交申請文件。逾時或缺席者須重新透過系統取籌。署方會繼續留意申請情況，有需要會適時調整即日籌數目。

有關「電子即日籌」安排由數字政策辦公室（數字辦）協助提供，以便利申請免試簽發的人士遙距領取即日籌，免卻實體輪候的需要，簡化申請流程。運輸署會與數字辦保持緊密合作，確保系統運作暢順。

香港牌照事務處會即日張貼告示，公布免試簽發「電子即日籌」的新安排，並加派人手維持秩序，以及解答市民的查詢和提供協助。至於其他駕駛執照相關櫃位服務，取籌和輪候安排維持不變。

運輸署發言人強調，署方一直嚴謹處理和核實每宗免試簽發申請。申請人必須提交足夠、真實和準確的證明文件並完全符合法例訂明的申請資格，申請方可獲批。

邁向免試簽發全面網上服務
————————————

此外，運輸署正與數字辦緊密合作，優化網上預約免試簽發櫃位服務的系統，包括新增認證技術及加大系統容量，務求盡快推出全面網上預約，以及將處理免試簽發申請的櫃位服務擴展至其餘三個牌照事務處（即位於長沙灣政府合署的九龍牌照事務處、東九龍政府合署的觀塘牌照事務處和沙田政府合署的沙田牌照事務處）。

長遠而言，署方正積極研究利用人工智能技術處理免試簽發申請程序，申請人可上載申請文件供系統初步審批，並只需按其預約時段帶同申請文件正本前往牌照事務處進行核實，進一步減少透過代辦提交申請的需要。署方會持續推動牌照服務電子化，適時公布新措施的詳情。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-07 18:00,2026-01-07 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700602.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月七日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​​​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-07 18:00,2026-01-07 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700603.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 7), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​​​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

香港房屋委員會（房委會）轄下財務小組委員會（小組委員會）今日（一月七日）在會議上通過二○二五／二六年度的修訂預算及二○二六／二七年度的建議預算。

根據最新的預算和財政預測，預計房委會將有足夠的財政資源，應付截至二○二九／三○年度的經常開支及資本開支。

小組委員會主席麥萃才博士在會議後表示：「隨着新公營房屋項目數量增加，在二○二六／二七年度後，建築開支將繼續上升。為確保房委會的長期財務可持續性，房委會已盡力開源節流。署方已成立了『項目促成辦公室』，協調各部門加快完成公營房屋建築工程及提升公營房屋項目的成本效益。此外，房委會會在二○二六／二七及二○二七／二八年度，每年削減2%的經常開支。」

麥萃才博士補充：「房委會會繼續探討不同的開源措施，例如公營房屋供應將逐步邁向公共租住房屋／綠表置居計劃與其他資助出售單位六比四的比例。房委會仍需增加來自出售居者有其屋計劃單位的收入來應付上升的建築開支。」

麥萃才博士指出：「基於不同因素的影響，這些財政的預測在未來幾年將無可避免地變動，並將會在下一輪預算更新。房委會會保持警覺，密切監察並檢視收入與開支的情況。」

房委會將於本月十九日舉行的公開會議上審議預算及財政預測，然後呈交行政長官批准。"
HA to consider Budget for 2026/27,2026-01-07 17:35,2026-01-07 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700309.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Housing Authority:

 At a meeting today (January 7), the Finance Committee (FC) of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) endorsed the 2025/26 Revised Budget and the 2026/27 Proposed Budget.

 Under the latest budgets and financial forecasts, it is envisaged that the HA will have the necessary financial resources to meet its recurrent and capital expenditures up to 2029/30.

 The FC Chairman, Dr Billy Mak, said after the meeting, ""The HA's construction expenditure will continue to rise beyond 2026/27 due to the increase in the number of new public housing projects. To ensure its long-term financial sustainability, the HA has made every effort to reduce construction costs in response to rising expenditure as much as possible. A Project Facilitation Office has been established to co-ordinate various departments to facilitate the completion of public housing projects and to enhance cost-effectiveness in public housing construction. In addition, the HA will trim its annual recurrent expenditure by 2 per cent for both 2026/27 and 2027/28.""

 Dr Mak added, ""The HA will continue to explore various revenue-enhanced/cost-saving measures, for example, advancing the public housing supply in the direction towards a 60:40 ratio between public rental housing/the Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme and other subsidised sale flats to increase its income from sale of Home Ownership Scheme flats to cope with the rising construction expenditure.""

 Dr Mak said, ""These financial forecasts will inevitably be changed over the next few years due to various factors. They will be updated in the next round of the budgeting exercise. The HA will no doubt stay vigilant and monitor closely, and review its income and expenditure situations.""

 The HA will hold an open meeting on January 19 to examine the budgets and financial forecasts. The budgets will be submitted to the Chief Executive for approval thereafter."

Hong Kong Customs detects case of non-registered precious metals and stones dealer carrying out specified transactions,2026-01-07 17:02,2026-01-07 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700573.htm,"Hong Kong Customs yesterday (January 6) detected a case involving a local company that conducted transactions of gold jewellery and pearl valued at over HK$120,000, without registration under the Dealers in Precious Metals and Stones Regulatory Regime. The company director was arrested.

  An investigation is ongoing. The arrested person has been released on bail.

Monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in December 2025 remains at low level,2026-01-07 17:00,2026-01-07 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700342.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (January 7) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in December 2025 was 0.2 per cent, lower than the 0.9 per cent recorded in November, which remained at the lowest Level 1, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the areas surveyed was not extensive.

In December last year, all 64 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index (AGI) lower than the alert level of 20 per cent, and most of the areas recorded zero per cent. Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in December last year was one, which represented that an average of one Aedes albopictus adult was found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department website at www.fehd.gov.hk.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""The FEHD has continued to intensify mosquito prevention and control work with relevant government departments in areas under their purview, including eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and placing mosquito trapping devices at suitable locations. The FEHD has also provided government departments with professional advice and technical support to assist them in swiftly formulating and implementing effective anti-mosquito measures while strengthening publicity and education at the same time. Under the concerted efforts and collaboration of various parties, the index in December last year remained at a low level. Although the index remains at a low level, the breeding and activity of mosquitoes will not stop in winter. The FEHD will continue to monitor the mosquito infestation in all districts and will conduct prompt and effective mosquito prevention and control work.

The FEHD currently makes regular announcements on gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD has strengthened information dissemination by promptly announcing the latest gravidtrap indexes through press releases and social media.

In addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF), the FEHD has extended the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI falling between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks and, in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together to take mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

To reduce the risk of transmission of CF and dengue fever (DF), the FEHD continues to step up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts and conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within a 250-metre radius of the residence of patients and the places patients had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

​Aedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit DF and CF. DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. Furthermore, according to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks last year, and as of early December last year, over 500 000 cases had been reported in 40 countries/regions worldwide. As of December 25 last year, Hong Kong recorded 59 imported DF cases; among the 82 confirmed CF cases recorded last year, 11 were local cases and the rest were imported. The DF and CF activities in neighbouring areas have remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."
二○二五年十二月份白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數維持於低水平,2026-01-07 17:00,2026-01-07 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700341.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（一月七日）公布，二○二五年十二月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之零點二，較十一月份的百分之零點九為低，繼續處於最低的一級水平，顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

去年十二月份，全部64個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平，大部分地區更為百分之零。另外，去年十二月份的白紋伊蚊密度指數為一，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁www.fehd.gov.hk。

食環署發言人表示：「食環署與相關政府部門已持續深化在各自管轄範圍的防蚊滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊子滋生地、施放殺幼蟲劑、以霧化處理方式殺滅成蚊，並於適當位置設置捕蚊器等。食環署亦為政府部門提供專業意見和技術支援，協助他們迅速制訂和實施有效的滅蚊措施，同時加強公眾宣傳教育。在各方共同努力和合作下，去年十二月份的指數維持低水平。雖然指數維持於低水平，但蚊子在冬季仍會繁殖和活動，食環署會持續監察各區的蚊患情況，並採取迅速有效的防治措施。」

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署已加強資訊發放，並通過新聞公報及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

為降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險，食環署繼續在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，並在病者的住所及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境以徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

​白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。此外，根據世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。去年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至去年十二月初，全球40個國家／地區共錄得超過50萬宗個案。截至去年十二月二十五日，本港錄得59宗外地傳入的登革熱個案；而去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。鄰近地區登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-07 06:46,2026-01-07 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010600836.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月七日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-07 06:46,2026-01-07 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010600834.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 7) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

 The public may also call Dial-a-Weather (1878 200) or visit thewebsite of the Hong Kong Observatoryfor the latest weather information and forecasts, or itspage on Weather Information for Senior Citizens."

They should notify their supervisors and seek medical help immediately if feeling unwell, such as having cold limbs and body shivering."
CFS urges public not to consume certain batches of powdered infant and young children formula,2026-01-06 22:38,2026-01-06 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600814.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (January 6) said that, the CFS has been actively following up on Nestlé company's voluntary and precautionary recalls of certain batches of its powdered infant and young children formula in certain areas in Europe due to possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus in the individual raw material. The CFS has earlier conducted immediate follow-up investigation, contacted local importers (including Nestlé Hong Kong Limited (Nestlé HK)), retailers and relevant authorities. According to the latest information from Nestlé HK today, 21 batches of its powdered infant and young children formula imported into Hong Kong might have used the raw material concerned. As a precautionary measure, Nestlé HK has voluntarily stopped sales, removed from shelves the affected products and has initiated a precautionary recall.

  Please refer to the Annex for product details of the 21 concerned batches of powdered infant and young children formula.

  A spokesman for the CFS said, ""Nestlé HK has initiated a recall of the affected batches of the products concerned. For enquiries about the recall, members of the public may call its hotline at 2599 8874.""

  The CFS, through its Food Incident Surveillance System, noted earlier that certain batches of Nestlé powdered infant formula were being voluntarily recalled in Europe due to possible contamination with Bacillus cereus. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS has immediately initiated follow up actions, published food incident posts to inform the public and the trade about the issue, and has been actively following up on the incident and enhanced surveillance.

  Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Cereulide is a heat-stable toxin produced in food by some strains of Bacillus cereus. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus or its heat-stable toxins may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

  The spokesman urged members of the public not to let infants and young children consume the affected batches of the products, and to seek medical treatment for infants or young children who felt unwell after taking the products concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batches of the products immediately.

  ""The CFS has alerted the trade and relevant department over the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. Follow-up work is ongoing,"" the spokesman said."
民政及青年事務局局長就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒答問內容（附短片）,2026-01-06 22:08,2026-01-06 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600745.htm,"民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（一月六日）就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒。以下是麥美娟的答問內容：

記者：局長你好，今早區議會有多名區議員反映希望當局可以盡快落實一個長遠的安置方案。其實當局有沒有時間表？方案會何時出爐？第二，民政署稱現時正檢討《建築物管理條例》，檢討方向會否包括授權票及會否擴大當局可介入的法團權力？

民青局局長：關於今早大埔區議會會議，我們都聽到區議員就着宏福苑居民的關注，包括希望能夠盡快有一個長期的安置方案。我也留意到議員表達的意見，包括希望長期的安置方案能夠盡快公布、盡快實施，不要讓居民等太久，也希望在原區找到合適的地方。他們也有提到，關於現時大埔宏福苑支援基金（大埔宏福苑援助基金）究竟是否足以應付重置方案的安排，希望政府能夠投入資源。其實在區議會會議前後，我們已將區議員的意見轉達給財政司副司長。相信副司長領導的小組也會考慮區議員所表達的居民意見和意願，盡快為居民提出一些方案。

至於《建築物管理條例》，正如我多次提到，如果大家有印象，在十多二十年前社會已開始討論《建築物管理條例》的各項修訂，但是過去十年都停留在討論階段。今屆政府銳意改善大廈管理的質素，所以我們馬上將討論了很久但一直未能付諸實行的法律修訂，在二○二三／二四年提交立法會討論，並在二○二四年得到立法會的支持，而有關的修訂也在二○二五年獲得通過生效。

就一些屋苑的大維修工程，如果每戶牽涉的金額超過三萬元以上，我們要求業主親身出席會議，並規定百分之十的業主親自出席會議。在二○二五年生效的《建築物管理條例》修訂中也提到關於利益申報，包括無論是管理公司或法團管委會成員，在任何招標過程中需申報牽涉的關係。二○二四年當時在立法會通過修例，我們已在立法會清楚表明《建築物管理條例》的修訂會繼續進行。我們會在新一屆立法會上任後，盡快提交《建築物管理條例》中建議的修訂，尤其在過去一段時間，看到很多法團召開會議或處理合約時，都會遇到一些具體問題，而現行《條例》未能詳細涵蓋。所以希望在立法會討論建議修訂那些條例，讓業主更清晰的「有例可依」，知道如何處理維修工程、採購工作或業主大會的流程。

剛才你提到的授權書處理等，都會提交立法會討論，也希望屆時聽取立法會議員的意見。《行政長官2025年施政報告》中特別提到，除了繼續檢視現行《建築物管理條例》第344章轄下需要修訂的地方外，也會在十八區區議會成立工作小組，即是今日大家在大埔區議會看到，除了大埔區議會，有幾個區議會亦已成立大廈管理工作小組，目的是希望聽取業主或業主立案法團在實際執行時遇到的具體問題，研究如何透過修訂《條例》，更好地發揮法團管委會的作用或工作。我們也希望透過工作小組，加強對業主的宣傳教育，令業主知道在屋苑進行大型維修工程時需要注意和關注甚麼，從而提升業主參與管理工作的能力，提高大廈管理的質素。

記者：想請問一下，今天也有見到有人說住在青年宿舍被人趕走，首先請局長可否釐清一下有沒有這樣的事情？還有過渡性房屋方面其實準備好了沒有？如果準備好了的話，安排是怎樣？如果還未準備好的話，青年宿舍那邊會不會可以延長他們的居住期，直至到居民可以上樓為止？

民青局局長：為了令到宏福苑的居民，在短暫的住宿能夠得到適當的安排，其實在十一月二十六日火警發生之後的一兩天，我們已經立刻透過酒店業界和青年宿舍，去找一些緊急的宿位安排給居民，可以有一個較好的地方休息和暫住。我們也在這個過程透過房屋局，找到差不多2 000個過渡性房屋，或者是房協的屋宇單位，給受影響的居民作為一個較長時期的、一個中期的住宿安排。

在過去一段時間，有居民，無論是留在酒店，又或者在青年宿舍，他們也知道這是一個短暫的住宿，但是可能他們尚未找到一個合適的地方作中期的安置，所以他們仍然留在原本的應急住宿。其實一開始的應急住宿大概是提供十四天，即是兩個星期。大家都看到，酒店業界亦好，青年宿舍的營運者亦好，他們都很好，將期限一路延長。我們也在十二月十八日推出了一個業主租金補助，這個業主租金補助是每年15萬，到現在，在宏福苑受影響的業主裏面，已經有超過1 400戶拿了這個租金補助。每年15萬的意思即是每個月大概有12,500元，雖然這名字是租金補助，但我們都沒有要求需要有租約才可以拿到租金補助，因為我們都是希望可以協助業主，解決中期的住宿問題。如果有些業主可能搬去與家人同住，他仍然可以領取這個租金補助。如果有些業主住在過渡屋，租金大約是3,000至4,000元，如果他領取了每月的12,500元的租金補助之後，其實仍然可以自己保留剩下的餘額，作為他們其他的生活開支。

所以在一些酒店也好，或者在青年宿舍的那些短期住宿，我們都需要協助居民過渡去一些中期的住宿安排。所以我們都看到青年宿舍、酒店一直陸陸續續有居民過渡去一些中期住宿，有些可能是在過渡屋，或者是房協的房屋，又或者他們在外面市場租屋。那麼在青年宿舍裏面，也都有居民選擇在外面租屋，又或者過渡了去過渡屋。當然也知道有些人需要更長時間留在青年宿舍，因為他們需要更長時間去找到適合的地方作為中期的住宿安排。青年宿舍的營運者亦講得很清楚，他們會按實際的情況去酌情處理這些個案。如果有一些仍然逗留在青年宿舍的住戶，因為在短時間未能夠找到中期的住宿，事實上青年宿舍的營運者有協助居民去找一些合適的中期住宿安排，亦為他們提供不同的協助。我們務求能夠做到每一個個案都可以按實際的情況能夠酌情處理，去為居民提供一個妥善的安排。

記者：想問現在法庭說合安管理公司不太適宜向土地審裁處提交報告，局方會否有其他方法申請新增去監管合安管理公司呢？還有想問，政府選擇合安管理公司的時候，有沒有諮詢過居民？雖然法團沒有提交反對通知書，但這段期間，局方有沒有收到居民有反對合安管理公司成為管理人的意見？

民青局局長：首先，在法庭我們本來為了合安（合安管理有限公司）的工作能夠令到大家有所監管，我們建議合安除了向民政事務總署提交每月的報告外，可以向土地審裁處提交季度報告。但是因為法庭在《建築物管理條例》下沒有角色去處理他們的報告，即他們是中立的角色，所以他們認為不需要向法庭提交報告。

但第一，合安作為持牌物管公司，每一間香港的持牌物業管理公司，都是受到物業管理監管局的條例、良好的作業指引和守則監管。如果他們違反這些要求或法例，物監局會做一些紀律的聆訊，包括他們要妥善處理文件，或協助法團做管理工作等。

另外，正如我剛才所說，民政事務總署亦會成立一個專班，協助委任管理人，即是合安，進行管理好宏福苑的工作。合安亦會每月向民政事務總署提交報告。同時，合安會在未來的日子安排不同的簡介會，令到居民更理解和了解合安作為管理人的角色和工作，亦會聽取居民的意見。

我們這次是引用《建築物管理條例》第31條提出的申請，這是符合法例的申請。這次的申請不是一個行政工作，而是一個根據法律而作出的申請。為甚麼我們要委任合安這間管理公司呢？其實我們是需要向法庭解釋的。為甚麼它是一個fit and proper 合適的委任管理人呢？正如我們向法庭解釋，第一，它是一間富經驗，已在香港業界營運數十年的一間持牌物業管理公司。第二，它的規模足以應付有關屋苑的管理需要。它不但具備持牌資格，亦擁有多名持牌管理人員，因為一間物業管理公司並非只有公司本身需要領牌，其職員同樣須為持牌人士。所以它有足夠的持牌人和專業團隊應付現在接管業主立案法團管委會的工作後，一些很繁複的法律和各項專業的要求。

另外，這間公司願意無償，即pro bono去工作，同時也得到龔如心慈善信託同意捐款，令到委任管理人的工作不需要為業主增加額外的經濟負擔，即是簡單來說，業主不用付款，由一些專業人士幫他們管理好複雜的文件、合約等等。

我們向法庭遞交申請的時候，已經陳述理據，為甚麼我們認為合安是一間合適讓我們委任成為管理人的公司。法庭最後也接納了我們的理據，亦同意委任合安成為管理人。

記者︰據現屆宏福苑法團的工作報告，顯示現時宏福苑的賬戶存款有一億多，還有一個保證金，與宏業簽署的，是今年七月到期的，想問一下合安會如何處理相關的財務安排，例如存款會歸去哪裏？會否發放給居民呢？第二，想問資訊透明度，剛才局長提到合安可能會舉辦相關的簡介會和安排交通，但居民現時都在不同地方，想問一下會否設立一些專題網站，或合安向政府提交報告時，報告會否公開予居民？

民青局局長︰你說的其實是很多居民想知的，這正正是社會大眾很想保護宏福苑居民的原因，亦是為何政府這次要引用《建築物管理條例》第31條向土地審裁處作出這個申請，無論大家說看以前的文件有這個合約、戶口有多少錢，但現在我們要真真正正、確確實實，究竟這個法團還簽了多少不同合約。大家知道一個法團除了是現在大家都關注的大維修合約外，作為一個普通的屋苑管理，會有很多不同的服務合約，包括電梯、消防、園藝、清潔和保安等。這些合約何時到期呢？條款是甚麼呢？在不同戶口內究竟現時有多少款項呢？進行大維修工程時，他們簽了例如保證金等，這些文件正正是我們為何需要透過這個申請，解散現屆法團的管委會，然後由一個委任管理人，可以向被解散的法團管委會和前管理公司得到這些文件。

合安有幾項很關鍵的工作要做，第一個，就是要跟這些前管理公司進行交接，接收對方現時持有各項與法團相關的文件，包括他們簽訂的合約和銀行賬戶。在收到這些資料後，合安需要聘請專業人士，可能是律師或會計師，協助他們釐清在這些不同的合約中，宏福苑業主或法團的法律責任。釐清這些責任後，這些資訊一定要讓業主知道，剛才我多次強調，這次行動我們沒有取代業主，我們現時做的是，合安可以透過法庭給予的委任，可以向前管理公司和被解散的法團管委會接收這些文件，看這些合約，釐清各項資料，然後告知宏福苑居民，讓他們清楚知道下一步應該怎麼做決定，因為他們可能有法律工作要做、合約要解除等，都要由業主做決定。當要開業主大會時，都需要讓業主有足夠的資料，才可以在開業主大會時作出一個充分的決定。

​剛才你所提及的，我們也考慮到怎樣可以將這些資訊給業主，所以合安幾個關鍵的工作中，其中一個是要進行簡介會。居民現時可能住在不同地方，我們可能在不同地點，多居民住、方便居民的地方進行簡介會，讓居民知道這些資訊，讓他們有充足的資訊。現時大家可能是聽人說、看群組，我們首要工作是接收這些文件後，再找專業人士協助看清楚，釐清不同合約的法律責任或帳目，令業主對整件事更清晰。
