"Government implements multiple measures to promote smart, green and modern logistics development",2026-01-16 16:12,2026-01-16 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600420.htm,"The Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) announced today (January 16) the implementation of various measures, including the formal rollout of the Port Community System (PCS) and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Data Collection Tools, as well as the release of the findings of the planning study on the development of a modern logistics cluster in Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area (HSK/HT NDA), with a view to promoting the smart, green, sustainable and modern development of Hong Kong's logistics industry through a multipronged approach.

The Secretary of Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, said, ""Our country has long been providing solid backing for Hong Kong's maritime development. The Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan (FYP) recently promulgated have clearly stated the objective of consolidating and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international maritime centre. The Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area also mentioned the active implementation of various measures to promote Hong Kong's maritime development. Since the Action Plan on the Modern Logistics Development (the Action Plan) has been promulgated for two years, with the full co-operation of the industry, we have completely implemented all action measures and been leading the Hong Kong logistics industry's transition towards high technology adoption and sustainable growth, thereby enhancing the industry's international competitiveness. We will continue to follow the guidance of the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th FYP, leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world to maintain our position as the region's leading international logistics hub, thereby better integrating into and serving the overall national development.""

  The logistics industry is one of the pillar industries of Hong Kong. To promote the sustainable and high-quality development of the industry, the Government promulgated the Action Plan in 2023, which formulated eight strategies and 24 action measures to assist the industry in embracing the new era of smart, green and modern logistics. Apart from a number of subsidy schemes to assist the industry in upgrading their operations by adopting smart and green logistics solutions and taking relevant training courses, as well as release land parcels to meet the industry's demand for premium logistics sites in the short to medium term, the Government is also working at full steam to build the new image of modern logistics as ""smart, innovative, high-end"" and reach out to young people on campus through the Curriculum on Logistics Industry and internship scheme, among others in order to attract young people to join the industry. Externally, on one hand, we commenced logistics co-operation with Guangxi, Chongqing and Chengdu with a view to exploring new cargo sources for Hong Kong. On the other hand, we enhanced overseas promotions to explore business opportunities together with the industry in Belt and Road countries.

PCS

In terms of smart logistics, the PCS, a critical digital infrastructure developed by the Government with over $200 million in funding, was formally rolled out today. It marks a significant milestone for the digital transformation of Hong Kong's port and logistics development.

The system provides one-stop, round-the-clock, real-time cargo tracking and links up sea, land, and air transport networks, thereby holistically enhancing the transparency, efficiency and interconnectivity of the logistics chain. Apart from its core function of real-time cargo tracking, the system will also offer value-added electronic services such as the ""One-Data-Multiple-Declarations"" function. By facilitating cargo import and export declarations by the industry, the system will provide one-stop services for local logistics and trading companies, thereby supporting the upgrading of the industry.

At today's PCS rollout ceremony, the TLB also signed a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding with the Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre and a local logistics start-up company, FUNDel, to accelerate the connection between the PCS and data platforms of the logistics industry, as well as study the utilisation of the trusted cargo flow data on the PCS to help financial institutions assess trade finance applications filed by relevant logistics small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), thereby supporting the sustainable development of the logistics industry.

Findings of the planning study on the development of Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen modern logistics cluster

The findings of the planning study on the development of a modern logistics cluster in the HSK/HT NDA were also announced today. To address the industry's long-term demand for logistics sites, the Government proposed to develop modern logistics clusters in the HSK/HT NDA. The relevant planning study commenced in March 2024 and was completed at the end of 2025.

After conducting a comprehensive consultation with the trade and considering comments from various stakeholders, the study suggests that the logistics cluster should adopt three major development directions, namely be ""enterprise-oriented"", have a ""market-enabling environment"" and an ""innovative approach to drive industry development"". It also suggests measures such as providing tailor-made entry terms for anchor enterprises and increasing the flexibility of development modes, with a view to ensuring the development of the logistics cluster meets the trends and demands of the market.

  The TLB plans to invite the industry to submit expressions of interest for the first logistics cluster site this year, and will draw up the relevant land lease terms and development mode after taking into account the intents of the industry to ensure that they keep pace with industry's development needs.

The Study Report has been uploaded to the website of the planning study on the development of a modern logistics cluster in HSK/HT NDA (www.lc-hskht.hk).

ESG Data Collection Tools

ESG is a new international development trend for the logistics trade. Further to the Government's announcement of the Roadmap for ESG Development for Logistics Industry in June 2025 which has outlined a clear way forward for adopting ESG by logistics SMEs, the TLB today further released a set of ESG Data Collection Tools (the Toolkit) tailored for logistics SMEs, with a view to assisting them in taking the first step towards putting ESG into practice.

The Toolkit includes a user-friendly data collection template, a data dictionary and a user manual. It aims to equip SMEs with the ability to collect and record ESG data early and use the collected data to prepare ESG data reports that fulfil international ESG disclosure requirements. In the long run, logistics SMEs may even utilise the data for reviewing and improving their ESG performance, thereby helping to build up Hong Kong logistics industry's sustainability credentials and enhance its competitiveness. Interested companies may register at the ESG Resource Centre on the website of Hong Kong Logistics Development Council (www.logisticshk.gov.hk/en/ESG/ESG_collection.php) to obtain the Toolkit for free.

  The TLB will continue to closely liaise and co-operate with the industry, and further consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international logistics hub through various policies and measures. The Government will also ensure that the logistics industry will maintain its edge in the international market and drive the development of trading and maritime industries at the same time by seizing the enormous opportunities brought by national and regional development, thereby promoting the high-quality development of Hong Kong's economy."

Grading of beach water quality released,2026-01-16 16:00,2026-01-16 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600558.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (January 16) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Six beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Golden Beach


Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Lido Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, Casam Beach and Lido Beach have been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."

"Housing Bureau and Development Bureau accept Independent Investigation Report submitted by Architectural Services Department regarding construction malpractices at three Light Public Housing sites and impose punitive measures on Contractor, Structural Engineer, and Project Management Consultant involved",2026-01-16 15:30,2026-01-16 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600346.htm,"​The Architectural Services Department (ArchSD) submitted the independent investigation report on the construction malpractices at the three Light Public Housing (LPH) sites at Lok On Pai in Siu Lam, Yan Po Road in Tuen Mun, and Sheung On Street in Chai Wan to the Housing Bureau (HB) and the Development Bureau (DEVB) on November 5, 2025. Upon a thorough review, both bureaux today (January 16) accepted the findings of the report and imposed punitive measures on the Contractor, Structural Engineer, and Project Management Consultant (PMC) involved. The ArchSD has also been tasked to continue its strict supervision on the Contractor and PMC in taking forward the remedial works expeditiously, alongside the immediate implementation of the improvement measures as set out in the report.

In light of the investigation results, the DEVB served notices today, in accordance with the regulatory mechanisms, to the companies involved about the following punitive measures to be imposed on them:

(1) The Contractor, i.e. Able Engineering Company Limited (Able), which is responsible for the construction and associated quality assurance: suspension of its eligibility to tender under all relevant categories of the List of Approved Contractors for Public Works and the List of Approved Suppliers of Materials and Specialist Contractors for Public Works for one year. As for Chun Wo Construction and Engineering Company Limited that formed the joint venture with Able, since its major involvement in the projects is to provide strategic advice on construction planning and has neither been involved in the site works nor supervision, it is not subject to the punitive measures;

(2) The Structural Engineer employed by the Contractor, i.e. C M Wong & Associates Limited, which is responsible for providing and managing the resident structural engineer involved: suspension of its eligibility to tender under all relevant categories of the List of Consultants of the Architectural and Associated Consultants Selection Board (AACSB) for one year; and

(3) The PMC employed by the ArchSD, i.e. Wong Tung & Partners Limited, which is responsible for providing project management and managing the resident site supervisors involved: suspension of its eligibility to tender under all relevant categories of the List of Consultants of AACSB for six months. The six-month suspension period was set with due consideration that not all of the project sites under its management were discovered with deficiencies in supervision.

Since the commencement of LPH construction, the ArchSD has always enforced strict quality supervision and proactive inspections, together with reviews on the performance of contractors. The prompt uncovering of malpractices at the three LPH sites during the ArchSD's proactive inspections was a direct reflection of the effectiveness of the supervision mechanism.

  The HB has tasked the ArchSD to continue its stern supervision of the Contractor to take forward the remedial works and the remaining construction works and to closely monitor construction quality and progress. Under the premise of adhering to the original completion dates, every effort shall be made to ensure that all projects comply with the relevant safety requirements. As directed by the ArchSD, the Contractor has implemented a host of remedial measures at full speed since early November last year, including shifting and reinstalling the modules involved, and will bear all costs related to the remedial measures.

Moreover, on the works contract level, the ArchSD requested that the Contractor implement a series of remedial measures and bear all the related costs of the remedial works. In addition, should the remedial measures result in any delay in the contract completion dates, the Contractor will be liable for liquidated damages. Moreover, the ArchSD has required the Contractor to replace all site supervision personnel, including site agents, works supervisors, and resident structural engineers. The ArchSD has also concurrently required the PMC to replace all its resident site supervisors. Meanwhile, the ArchSD has immediately strengthened its supervision by deploying full-time government site supervision staff to monitor the sites and has arranged for its structural engineers to conduct additional on-site spot checks and audits to ensure strict quality control for the projects.

Based on preliminary evidence, Able is suspected of serious negligence or misconduct in the construction works. The ArchSD will inform the Building Authority to refer the case to the Registered Contractors' Disciplinary Board under Section 13 of the Buildings Ordinance. As provided in the Ordinance, if, upon hearing, negligence or misconduct in construction works were found to have been committed, the Board may order the removal of Able or its directors, senior personnel, or individuals from the relevant lists, impose fines, or issue a reprimand on Able or its directors, senior personnel, or individuals.

As the investigation revealed that the incident may involve criminal acts of providing false statements, the ArchSD has already reported the case to the Police.

The Government will continue to follow up on the case in a serious manner and step up its site supervision efforts to ensure the overall construction quality, safety and progress are not affected, as well as to ensure each LPH project is completed with high quality and high safety standards, thereby providing decent homes for residents in need as soon as possible."
房屋局及發展局接納建築署有關三個「簡約公屋」項目工地施工問題的獨立調查報告　懲處涉事承建商、結構工程師及項目管理顧問,2026-01-16 15:30,2026-01-16 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600345.htm,"建築署於二○二五年十一月五日向房屋局及發展局提交就小欖樂安排、屯門欣寶路及柴灣常安街三個「簡約公屋」項目工地施工不當問題的獨立調查報告（獨立調查報告）。經詳細審閱後，局方今日（一月十六日）接納獨立調查報告所闡述的調查結果，懲處涉事承建商、結構工程師及項目管理顧問，並責成建築署繼續嚴格督導承建商及其項目管理顧問全速進行補救工作，以及即時落實報告中列出的改善建議。

因應調查結果，發展局已按規管機制，於今日向相關公司發出通知將執行以下懲處措施：

（一）承建商：停止負責工地施工及相關質量監管工作的安保工程有限公司（下稱「安保」）在認可公共工程承建商名冊及認可公共工程物料供應商及專門承造商名冊內所有相關類別的投標資格一年；至於與安保聯營的俊和建築工程有限公司，主要就項目提供工程規劃的策略意見，並不涉及工地施工和監管，因此不在懲處之列；

（二）承建商聘請的結構工程師：停止負責提供和管理涉事駐工地結構工程師的黃志明建築工程師有限公司在「建築及有關顧問公司遴選委員會」顧問名單內所有相關類別的投標資格一年；

（三）建築署聘請的項目管理顧問：停止負責提供項目管理和管理駐工地監督的王董建築師事務有限公司在「建築及有關顧問公司遴選委員會」顧問名單內所有相關類別的投標資格六個月；停止期設定為六個月，是考慮其並非在所有項目工地出現監管缺欠。

自「簡約公屋」項目推展以來，建築署持續嚴格執行品質監督及主動巡查工作，並審視承建商的表現，而署方在主動檢查時即時發現三個「簡約公屋」項目工地施工不當問題，正正反映監管機制行之有效。

房屋局已責成建築署必須繼續嚴格督促承建商推進補救工作及餘下的工程，並密切監察施工質素和相關進度，在以原有完工日期為目標的大前提下，竭盡所能確保各個項目符合相關安全要求。在建築署的督導下，承建商已於去年十一月初開始全速進行一系列補救措施，包括挪開及重裝涉事模組等，亦會承擔補救措施而產生的所有相關費用。

另外，從工程合約層面，建築署除了要求承建商進行一系列補救措施及承擔補救措施而產生的所有相關費用外，如果補救措施導致合約完工日期有所延誤，承建商須承擔遲延損害賠償。此外，建築署亦已要求承建商更換所有負責工程監督的駐工地人員，包括其現場代理、工程監督及駐工地結構工程師。同時建築署亦已要求項目管理顧問更換所有駐工地監督。建築署亦即時加強政府工地監督人員每天全職於前線直接監督工地，及安排署方的結構工程師現場進行額外的突擊抽查及審核，以保證項目嚴格執行品質監控。

初步證據顯示安保在建築工程方面涉嫌觸犯嚴重疏忽或行為不當，建築署會通知建築事務監督根據《建築物條例》第13條的規定轉介註冊承建商紀律委員會處理。根據相關條例，若經研訊後裁定其在建築工程方面曾犯有疏忽或行為不當，委員會可命令將安保或其董事、高級人員或人士的姓名或名稱從有關名冊中刪除，或對安保或其董事、高級人員或人士處以罰款、或作出譴責。

由於調查過程中發現事件有可能涉及涉嫌提供虛假陳述的刑事行為，建築署已向警方舉報。

政府會繼續嚴肅跟進，並會加強相關地盤監管，以保障整體工程質素、安全和進度不受影響，確保每個「簡約公屋」工程均以高質素及高安全標準完成，為有需要的市民盡快提供安居之所。"

海關歡迎裁決，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

此外，根據《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》，任何人不得推廣、製造、售賣或為商業目的而管有另類吸煙產品。違例者一經定罪，最高可處罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。

During an anti-illicit cigarette operation conducted in a commercial building in Tsuen Wan on October 20, 2025, Customs officers intercepted a 40-year-old man who claimed to be a warehouse assistant for inspection and seized a total of about 980 000 illicit cigarettes and 620 000 alternative smoking products from his trolley and a unit inside the building. The total estimated market value was about $6.3 million, and the duty potential of the illicit cigarettes was about $3.2 million.

Customs welcomes the sentences. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Moreover, under the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance, no person may promote, manufacture, sell, or possess for commercial purposes alternative smoking products. An offender is liable to a fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

財政司司長出席立法會財務委員會特別會議開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-16 13:17,2026-01-16 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600406.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（一月十六日）上午出席立法會財務委員會特別會議簡報香港整體經濟最新狀況及二○二六至二○二七年度《財政預算案》諮詢的開場發言：

主席、各位議員：

早晨。多謝大家今日給予我們和相關同事一個機會，來此向大家匯報香港的經濟現況，以及二○二六年的經濟展望。同時，更重要是藉此機會，希望就二月底發表的《財政預算案》聽取大家的意見。

首先是香港的經濟現況。去年在地緣政治格局的壓力下，香港的經濟仍然取得估計約3.2%的增長。推動經濟增長的「三頭馬車」的表現大致是這樣：出口方面的表現相當不錯，商品出口增加10%，而出口的另一部分是服務輸出，服務輸出主要有兩方面，一個是旅遊服務，另一個是金融服務。

旅遊方面，訪港旅客的數字去年約4 990萬，接近5 000萬，較前一年增加，其中尤其顯着增加的比例是來自非內地的旅客，包括東南亞、中東，以至歐美的客人。大家可能最近見到在街上外來的訪客都增多了。

服務輸出方面，金融市場的表現相當不錯，股票市場，去年除了IPO（首次公開招股）增加外，整體交投量均上升。

推動經濟增長的另一頭「馬車」就是消費。消費可以說有一個增長，是輕微增長，但總的來說，是我們「三頭馬車」中增長得比較弱的一個環節。但在近月，我們已經看到明顯的改善。

至於投資方面，首三季的增長大概是2.5%。在去年的經濟環境下，我們的通脹率大概是1.2%左右，處於比較低的水平。失業率曾經達3.9%，跟着回落到3.8%，現時大概在這個位置徘徊。失業率比較高的主要三個範疇，一個是建築，另一個是餐飲，第三個是零售。

稍後介紹資產市場的狀況時，大家就會看到現時樓市相對來說已穩定下來，而且私人發展商開工和申請開工地盤的數字亦有所增加。換句話說，建造業的就業情況方面應該可以在稍後得到緩解。

零售方面，剛才說去年私人消費方面增長較弱，因為北上消費和之前港元走強，以至疫後，不管是旅客或香港市民消費模式的改變，零售和餐飲行業受到一定的壓力，但這些行業在近月亦得到改善。以零售為例，在八月、九月、十月、十一月等幾個月都是正增長，尤其踏入九月後，每個月跟去年同期比較，均增長大概6%至7%之間；餐飲方面，比零售恢復得較慢，但如果我們回看數字，在七、八月有輕微增長，就這幾個月而言，大致亦是穩住。

資產市場方面，住宅樓市一月至十一月的樓價大概上升2.8%，租金大概上升4.3%，在零售商鋪方面，租金下跌大概約4.2%。寫字樓曾經出現供求失衡的情況，我們自從二○二四年第四季開始已經沒有賣寫字樓用地，亦多方面擴闊寫字樓的用途，譬如讓位於合適地點的寫字樓改裝為學生宿舍等，穩住寫字樓的市道。股票市場去年增長28%，前年為18%，所以這兩年的表現均不錯，其中尤其是交投量方面，去年日均交投量接近2,500億元，跟之前一年比較增長大概90%，這是資產市場的狀況。補充一下，近幾個月見到寫字樓市道有兩方面可喜的發展，一是多了國際金融機構，尤其是做資產及財富管理的機構，增加在香港租用寫字樓。此外，亦有一些第三代互聯網、數字資產的企業，在銅鑼灣、灣仔一帶，租用甚至購買不少整棟寫字樓。

特區政府過去幾年搶企業、搶人才方面的進展如下：引進重點企業辦公室由二○二二年年底到現在，大概引進超過102間重點企業。他們的總投資額在幾年間大概為600億元，並創造超過兩萬個相對高薪的就業崗位。

此外，投資推廣署同時在二○二四年／二五年，在二○二四年吸引大概539間企業，二○二五年亦有超過550間。創造的就業崗位，去年估計有大概超過一萬個。

吸引人才方面，由二○二二年年底至去年年底，總共收到58萬個申請，有40萬宗申請已獲批准，其中大概26萬人已到香港。這是搶人才方面的狀況。

為了留更多時間聽大家的意見，以及就住大家關心的問題提出我們的資訊和回應，我簡單說二○二六年的展望。二○二六年我們是審慎樂觀的。審慎是因為我們見到地緣政治外圍的風險，目前來說相信只會加劇。在這情況之下，資本市場難免會出現大幅波動。地緣政治亦會影響資金流向，這樣的環境下，我們必須要審慎，一方面要大力發展，但同時也要統籌安全方面的工作，尤其是金融安全，防範「黑天鵝」或「灰犀牛」事件的出現，確保金融穩定。

審慎樂觀，樂觀的原因是在過去這幾個月，經濟發展的勢頭不錯。同時，內地的經濟發展亦是穩步向好。政策空間很多，大家都看得到，人民銀行昨日亦宣布了降準。內地的政策空間非常充裕，經濟穩步增長，這是香港經濟增長的最大後盾，亦為我們帶來經濟增長的動力。

此外，市場預期今年二○二六年美國會減息。雖然減息次數未必多，可能一至兩次，但總體來說，金融市場會變得較為寬鬆，會有利營商，亦會有利金融市場的發展。

今年的工作方面，二○二六年其中一個重點，除了穩步推進經濟發展外，就是對接國家的「十五五」規劃。「十五五」規劃預計會在兩會公布。目前而言，我們的觀察和分析認為：香港必須要更好融入和服務國家發展大局。換句話說，不單是融入，是要服務國家發展大局，這在新時代中突顯香港「一個兩制」之下的獨特優勢。

除了服務國家發展大局外，這亦有助我們有更好的發展。譬如「十五五」規劃建議提出，國家會繼續推動高質量發展。高質量發展是甚麼？它的內涵包括高水平科技自立自強，也包括推動社會經濟發展全面綠色轉型。在這方面，香港是國際綠色金融中心，亦都很具備條件。以國家對綠色轉型資金的需求之大，我們完全有條件可以發展成為世界領先的綠色金融中心，發揮作用，亦得到好處。同時，「十五五」規劃將繼續鼓勵高水平雙向開放，有更多內地企業會出海，他們在全球布局其產業鏈和供應鏈。在這過程中，我們可以邀請他們在香港成立公司，與香港的專業服務和商界一起拼船出海。在這過程中，我們更好地發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色。香港在「一國兩制」中非常獨特的特色，便是我們的國際化和多元化。

金融方面，未來一項重要的工作，是人民幣國際化的全面布局。此外，在貿易方面，我們亦要順應剛才提及內地企業出海的大潮，特區政府亦組織了內地企業出海專班，把握這個機遇。

最後一點，是影響未來世界經濟三大主要趨勢，除了地緣政治、綠色發展外，就是創新科技。創科發展，尤其是人工智能，將會定義不同經濟體的核心競爭力，亦是大家將來互相比拼最激烈的地方。在創科發展中，我們會大力推動人工智能發展。人工智能發展主要從兩方面，一方面是推動人工智能發展成為核心產業，另一方面是利用人工智能助力企業以至個人擁抱人工智能，升級轉型。我們的工作主要包括六個方面，包括算力、數據、算法、應用場景、人才和資金。尤其在應用場景方面，我們要跟粵港澳大灣區的兄弟城市，譬如是深圳，更緊密地聯動發展，優勢互補，增加動力。換句話說，以香港國際金融中心的優勢，以及基礎研究成果的轉化，加上深圳等較全面的工業基礎和生產鏈，粵港澳大灣區完全有能力發展成為能與美國三藩市灣區加上紐約灣區比拼的地區，為國家發展作出貢獻。

多謝主席，我先停在此，請各位議員多多指正。"

Global Summit today (January 16):

Ms Qiu (Vice President of DLG Exhibitions & Events Co Ltd, Ms Qiu Haoming), Hendrick (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's Deputy to the 14th National People's Congress, Mr Hendrick Sin), Terry (Chief Executive Officer of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, Mr Terry Wong), Duncan (Member of the Legislative Council, Mr Duncan Chiu), Alex (President of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation, Dr Alex Chung), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am delighted to join you at the 2026 WAIC UP! Global Summit.Today's theme, ""Wake Up More!"", is a call not only for any single company, city, or country but also a timely reminder for all of us to embrace a new era of intelligence, possibility, and shared responsibility.

  A big thank you to the organiser for choosing Hong Kong as a destination for this remarkable Summit. This is another testament to Hong Kong's unique position as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" that thrives on global connection and creativity. We are delighted to see that world-class academics, industry experts and leading entrepreneurs from around the world gather here today to explore the future of AI and the opportunities it brings to us.

  AI has become a core engine driving global technological and economic progress, and all economies recognise its strategic importance.Under the unique advantages of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is also seizing this AI moment.With a focus on ""strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach"", Hong Kong is steadily advancing a series of AI initiatives.

  In terms of R&D (research and development), the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government is working to establish the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute within this year, which is a new engine for discovery, translation, and real-world impact.Through our AIR@InnoHK research cluster, we have funded the establishment of 16 R&D laboratories focusing on AI and robotics technologies.Notably, the ""HKChat"" AI chatbot developed by the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center has already launched its public version.

  Hong Kong's total computing power has now reached 5 000 PFLOPS, with the Cyberport AI Supercomputing Centre contributing 3 000 PFLOPS. This centre is a critical hub that supports Hong Kong's AI development, and its capacity will continue to expand to meet growing demand. The upcoming data facility cluster at Sandy Ridge in North District will further provide advanced computing power facilities, promoting the development of data and AI-related industries in Hong Kong.

  And at the heart of all progress is talent. We recognise that people, not algorithms, will shape the future of AI. Our strategy is simple yet powerful: ""Promote technology with talent, lead industries with technology, and attract talent with industries"". To this end, we have included in the Talent List a number of professions in the I&T (innovation and technology) segment, including experienced AI Specialists, to facilitate global experts, like all of you here, in developing your careers in Hong Kong.

  Looking ahead, the Hong Kong SAR Government will continue to foster strong collaboration among the Government and the industry, academia, research and investment sectors. The future of AI cannot be built by anyone or any place alone. It requires a global community that is awake, aware, and aligned.I am confident that this Summit will spark new ideas and inspire us to wake up more for high-quality AI development. 

  I wish the Summit great success. Thank you."

  And at the heart of all progress is talent. We recognise that people, not algorithms, will shape the future of AI. Our strategy is simple yet powerful: ""Promote technology with talent, lead industries with technology, and attract talent with industries"". To this end, we have included in the Talent List a number of professions in the I&T (innovation and technology) segment, including experienced AI Specialists, to facilitate global experts, like all of you here, in developing your careers in Hong Kong.

  Looking ahead, the Hong Kong SAR Government will continue to foster strong collaboration among the Government and the industry, academia, research and investment sectors. The future of AI cannot be built by anyone or any place alone. It requires a global community that is awake, aware, and aligned.I am confident that this Summit will spark new ideas and inspire us to wake up more for high-quality AI development. 

  I wish the Summit great success. Thank you."
​行政長官在香港環境卓越大奬頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2026-01-16 11:45,2026-01-16 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600247.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（一月十六日）在香港環境卓越大奬頒獎典禮的視像致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今日是新一屆香港環境卓越大獎頒獎典禮，我首先祝賀活動順利舉行，並感謝各界攜手推動香港環保事業向前邁進。

今屆的參賽機構數目再創新高，反映各界對香港可持續發展的決心，令人鼓舞。我在此恭賀所有獲獎企業和機構，你們把環保理念融入日常營運之中，為香港高質量發展注入綠色動能，值得肯定。

二十屆四中全會審議通過《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》，提出要牢固樹立和踐行綠水青山就是金山銀山的理念，以碳達峰、碳中和為牽引，協同推進降碳、減污、擴綠、增長，築牢生態安全屏障，增強綠色發展動能。特區政府將繼續全力以赴，完善環境管理，助力綠色轉型，穩步推進減碳工作，推動香港邁向可持續的未來。

推動低碳發展，需要綠色技術。為配合國家實現「雙碳」目標，香港致力於二○五○年前達致「碳中和」。我在《施政報告》中提出推動新能源產業發展，建設可持續航空燃料產業鏈。我們會與內地政府協商，帶領一間全球主要供應商的本地企業在大灣區發展，以配合二○三○年香港國際機場出發航班須使用指定可持續航空燃料的目標。

加快綠色轉型，需要創新驅動。政府會繼續透過「低碳綠色科研基金」及「創新及科技基金」，支持本地綠色科研和成果轉化。我們會助力企業將回收物料升級再造為高增值產品，讓綠色工業在港落地生根，壯大綠色經濟生態圈，打造香港成為綠色科技示範基地。

實現零廢堆填，需要持之以恆。政府以二○三五年達致零廢堆填為目標，會繼續優化「綠在區區」服務網絡，支援住宅樓宇進行回收。另外，我們亦會繼續增加住宅的智能廚餘回收桶和收集設施，鼓勵公眾實踐源頭減廢與分類回收。

推動環保工作，是一場需要創新、協作和恆心的長途賽。香港環境卓越大獎由環境運動委員會主辦、環境及自然保育基金資助，並聯同社會各界多個機構合辦，成效卓越。環境運動委員會在一九九○年成立，過去超過35年以來一直全力提高香港市民的環保意識。我感謝委員會多年來不遺餘力，推動環保宣傳教育，為香港的可持續發展奠下基石。

特區政府將繼續與各界並肩同行，推動低碳發展。我期望各個得獎機構繼往開來，帶動夥伴共同進步，攜手為香港拓展更多綠色機遇，為建設美麗中國、美麗香港作出更大貢獻。

最後，我祝願香港環保事業更上層樓，在座各位身體健康、工作順利，多謝大家。"

Speech by CE at 2026 WAIC UP! Global Summit (English only) (with video),2026-01-16 11:00,2026-01-16 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600244.htm,"  Following is the video speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the 2026 WAIC UP! Global Summit today (January 16):

Distinguished guests, friends from the world of AI, ladies and gentlemen,

  A very warm welcome to Hong Kong. It is a pleasure to join you today, at this year's WAIC UP! Global Summit.

  A gathering that brings together top experts, industry pioneers and academic leaders, the WAIC UP! Global Summit is a platform under the renowned World Artificial Intelligence Conference. I'm glad to add that the Summit is held for the very first time in Hong Kong this year. The theme of this Summit, ""WAKE UP MORE!"", underscores the infinite possibilities of artificial intelligence. We must harness the power of AI, not just to innovate, but to build - to build more inclusive economies, more resilient communities, and a more sustainable future for all.

  The Recommendations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development supports Hong Kong's development into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre, as well as an international hub for high-calibre talent.

  Hong Kong is moving at full steam to develop into an international I&T centre. Central to this vision is our commitment to advancing the development of AI. Our approach is multifaceted, built upon the solid pillars of government investment, world-class research, strategic infrastructure, and a dynamic, open market.

  Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage. We are also the only city that counts as many as five universities in the world's top 100. Our institutions equip Hong Kong's next generation with the versatility and knowledge key for future development. They also bring together a world of academics, researchers and talent to contribute to our ever-growing research and innovation capabilities.

  We reached a significant milestone in our innovation journey, just last month, with the official opening of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone. We will develop the Hong Kong Park into a world-class hub for technological innovation that connects the Mainland with the international community. It will become an important source for fostering and advancing new quality productive forces for China, our country.

  Accelerating the flow of talent, data and capital, the Hong Kong Park will allow AI projects to rapidly progress from fundamental research in Hong Kong, to commercialisation and large-scale application in the broader market.

  Last September, we launched the Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme to subsidise universities in attracting top-notch scientific researchers from the world in AI, and other fields, to come to Hong Kong to spearhead basic research in frontier technologies.

  We have also earmarked HK$1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development (R&D) Institute this year, to facilitate upstream AI R&D, the midstream and downstream R&D outcomes, and the expansion of use cases.

  In addition, we have taken a concrete step within the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government by establishing a new AI Efficacy Enhancement Team. More than just showcasing our resolve to AI development, this team has a clear mission - to co-ordinate all government departments in applying AI technology, and to explore process re-engineering and promote technological reform. This will significantly improve government efficacy to better meet public demands, through the important tool of AI.

  Ladies and gentlemen, in this era of rapid technological transformation, Hong Kong is in a distinct position. With the robust rule of law, a welcoming business environment, and a vibrant multicultural setting, Hong Kong is the perfect incubator for scientific exploration and technological breakthroughs.

  Let us leverage today's summit as a springboard for deeper partnerships. Together, we can pioneer the technologies, establish the standards, and forge the future we wish to see - an AI-empowered future that is equitable, sustainable, and prosperous for all.

  I wish you all a most fruitful and inspiring summit. Thank you very much."

During the operation, Hong Kong Customs detected 14 cases and seized about 19 000 suspected counterfeit goods, including handbags, footwear and electronic products, with a total estimated market value of about $14 million.

Through intelligence analysis and detailed investigations, Hong Kong Customs in the operation detected 13 related cases at a number of local express couriers and logistics companies.

Police open fire in Castle Peak,2026-01-16 01:36,2026-01-16 02:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600039.htm,"Police are investigating a Police open fire case in Castle Peak last night (January 15).

About 7.10pm, Police received a report from a staff member of a shop on Tuen Shun Street that a man fled away after stealing a knife from the shop. Subsequently, Police have also received multiple reports that a man holding a knife was found wandering in the vicinity of Tuen Wui Street. Police officers sped to the scene and located the man, who was holding a 12-inch long knife, outside the entrance of a shopping mall on Tuen Shun Street.

Despite multiple verbal warnings given by the officers, the man refused to cooperate and an officer discharged one burst of pepper spray. The man then fled into the mall and exited from another entrance shortly afterwards. He then held a female passerby hostage and attempted to assault her with the knife. Officers gave further verbal warnings to the man but in vain. To ensure the safety of the hostage, two police officers each fired a shot at the man.

Sustaining shot wounds to his shoulder and chest, the 34-year-old man was sent to Tuen Mun Hospital in unconscious state and was certified dead at 8.47pm; the 51-year-old woman, who was held hostage, was sent to Tuen Mun Hospital in conscious state.

Some suspected dangerous drug and an extendable baton were seized from the man and the bag he carried.

Investigations by the Regional Crime Unit of New Territories North are under way. Anyone who has any information to offer is urged to contact the investigating officers on 3661 3363.

​The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) today (January 15) alerted members of the public to remain vigilant against a fraudulent website posing as the ""Hospital Authority Medical Certificate Verification Website"".

The HA stated that this fraudulent website falsely claimed to verify the electronic medical certificates issued by public hospitals, thereby inducing members of public to input personal information such as patient names and sick leave dates from their medical certificates. The spokesperson emphasized that the HA has no connection with this website and urged members of the public not to provide any personal information to suspicious websites of unknown origin.

The spokesperson said, ""The HA introduced electronic medical certificates in March 2023. Each electronic medical certificate bears an encrypted QR code. If members of the public need to verify an electronic medical certificate, they can simply scan the QR code on the certificate to access the correct official website for verification.""

The HA is highly concerned about the incident and has contacted relevant authorities to remove the fraudulent website. The case has been referred to the police and the HA will fully cooperate with the relevant investigation.

保安局局長談國際刑警組織全體大會籌備工作、消防措施及宏福苑火災（只有中文）,2026-01-15 20:16,2026-01-15 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/15/P2026011500672.htm,"​以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（一月十五日）傍晚在香港國際機場會見傳媒的談話內容：

保安局局長︰各位香港市民，各位記者朋友，大家好。昨晚（一月十四日）我與警務處處長前赴北京，並於今早與公安部副部長徐大彤就今年年底在香港舉行的國際刑警組織全體大會會議作出討論，以及報告香港的準備情況。國際刑警組織全體大會今年會由國家承辦，並於香港召開，預計會有196個國家的警務首長和高級官員、大約1 000人在香港，就最新的罪案趨勢、共同面對的安全風險和保安風險，以及如何加強國際合作和全球性和區域性的安全議題作出討論。今次非常榮幸能夠代表國家在香港召開這個會議，我們希望可以透過這個會議，除了辦好剛才提及的事情外，亦可以讓人看到香港由治及興新景象，亦可以展現無論在安全、社會包容、我們的專業性及科技創新方面的新景象，另外亦可顯現「一國兩制」之下的成功。我們必然會做好這個會議。

我想談談第二個課題，昨天我在立法會跟大家說過關於消防和救災的新措施。我想強調兩點，第一點是除了消防同事，正如我昨日提過有很多新措施，包括加強巡查、引入新科技和新策略，其實有關的管理公司和業主也可以幫忙。舉例來說，消防同事很努力地巡查，包括現時「便裝」都會巡查，希望發現一些消防隱患，讓有關人士可以改善。然而，我們（消防人員）總不能天天在處所站崗。有些報章都報道過，我們（消防人員）離開後，（防煙）門又繼續被人打開。我們認為住客在這方面可以幫忙，所以我們接下來計劃訓練一些住客，令他們有些防火意識，還有一些基本防火措施，讓他們自己在大廈內採取巡查，如發現有問題，除可即時通知管理公司或相關人士改善外，亦都可以向消防處申報，令我們採取執法行動更加有效。

另外，我們希望管理公司加強巡邏和作出相關紀錄。我亦提過，希望他們可以採納以後火警鐘由每一年改為每半年測試一次，以及每年都進行防火演習，並在進行防火演習前，邀請消防處同事提供防火講座。如果遇到要進行大維修，在大維修前必須將相關消防設施做好，亦要加強在大維修期間的巡查，特別是建築物料或材料會否阻塞通道。如果有這些情況，也要即時通知消防處。

我亦想說說，有關立法方面，我們正在研究包括我剛才所說的管理公司某些部分的責任，是否可以除了行政措施之外，以立法方式處理呢？另外，就着一些很容易證明的違規行為，例如擺放物品阻塞通道，走火門上鎖等，採取可以即時票控的形式處理。就着註冊承辦商，如果他們提供虛假或者誤導的資料，現時最高刑罰是罰款五萬元，我們認為應該大幅提高，包括判處監禁刑罰。就着消防設備暫停使用方面，由現時的事後申報，改為事前向消防處匯報，以及在消防處作出批准後才可以進行。我希望這兩點能協助救火和避災方面的情況。

記者：關於宏福苑DNA的鑑證工作進度，想問死亡人數有沒有新增？之後會不會公開死者名單？另外，剛剛局長提到會訓練住客幫忙巡查，實際上住客是否需要上一些課程？他們會做甚麼訓練呢？

保安局局長：首先就着大埔宏福苑的遇難者人數，我們剛剛透過科學鑑證和法證，證實總數是168名遇難人士，我們後期是透過牙齒測試或DNA測試（去辨認）。所有168名遇難者的家人，我們已經通知他們相關情況，他們亦確認了這些遇難者的身分。這168名人士包括一名殉職消防員、兩名裝修工人、五名地盤工友和十名外籍傭工。在這事件中，現時所有遺體和遺骸均已完成辨認，再沒有任何遺體或遺骸未被辨認。曾經提過聯絡不到或者失蹤的人，我們已全部澄清，所以168名遇難人士是最終數字。

警方就着死因正在進行調查，當調查完成後，便會向死因裁判官提交報告。如果死因裁判官決定要召開死因研訊，我們便會將相關死者的資料於研訊期間透露。目前階段，我們為了尊重遇難人士家人的意願，我們並不會公布所有遇難人士的名單，這與以往的做法是一致的。

至於剛才提過，在相關大廈訓練住客，希望他們可以作出通報。這將會是一個很簡單的訓練，第一是希望他們加強巡查，見到（防煙）門被打開，或者有雜物阻塞消防通道，可以即時向管理處作出投訴，希望改善或者通報給消防跟進；或者是關於很簡單的事情，例如滅火筒如何使用，或者消防喉如何使用，這些都不是很複雜的事情。我們希望透過住客關心自己住處安全的自發性，除了提高意識之外，也希望可以減低發生火災的機會。

記者：國際刑警組織全體大會下一屆為何會選擇於香港舉行？香港於承辦大會方面有何優勢？我們是第一次舉辦，希望可以取得甚麼成果？

保安局局長：首先很榮幸國家讓香港召開和主辦這個會議。正如我剛才所說，在香港主辦可以將我們由治及興的新氣象展現給全世界看到，看到我們在安全、社會包容性和效率方面等的所有優點。其實香港舉辦了很多大型國際會議，包括每年主辦很多的金融會議。警隊也在主辦國際性和刑事課題有關的活動方面有豐富經驗。今次我們籌辦國際刑警組織全體大會，不單是警隊的事情，而是整個政府不同部門都會協助，而政務司司長亦主持督導委員會去做好這件事，加上國家於背後大力支持，我非常有信心辦好這個會議。"
反非法勞工行動拘七人（附圖）,2026-01-15 19:10,2026-01-15 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/15/P2026011500620.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）今日（一月十五日）展開代號為「促進行動」的反非法勞工行動。於行動中，入境處特遣隊人員在上水區一個新建公共屋邨內搜查多個裝修中單位，共拘捕六名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為六名男子，年齡介乎二十二歲至四十一歲。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主則為一名男子，年齡為四十五歲。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

在執法的同時，入境處人員亦安排宣傳車於屋邨內派發「切勿聘用非法勞工」的宣傳單張，呼籲切勿聘用非法勞工。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

Seven persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operation (with photos),2026-01-15 19:10,2026-01-15 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/15/P2026011500621.htm,"  ​The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted an anti-illegal worker operation codenamed ""Contribute"" today (January 15).During the operation, ImmD Task Force officers raided premises under renovation in a newly built public housing estate in Sheung Shui district.A total of six suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested. Thearrested suspected illegal workers comprise six men, aged 22 to 41. Furthermore, one man, aged 45, suspected of employing the illegal workers, was also arrested. An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  ​Apart from mounting the enforcement operation, ImmD officers and a promotional vehicle have been deployed to distribute ""Don't Employ Illegal Workers"" leaflets and convey the message in the estate.

  ​An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

   The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

   According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

   Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

蔡冠深會長（香港中華總商會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

很高興再次來到中總（香港中華總商會）一年一度的「中總論壇」，與在座各位工商界代表，以及外國商界和領事代表聚首一堂，在一年之初展望新一年的經濟形勢，並且探討如何推動香港經濟高質量發展。今年也是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，對香港的經濟發展意義重大，如何推動香港更好融入和服務國家發展大局，也是一個很重要的課題。

回顧二○二五年

二○二五年可以説是風起雲湧的一年，單邊主義、保護主義和霸權主義為全球經濟帶來巨大的風險和不確定性，而踏入二○二六年，大家都看到，這些行徑有變本加厲、更肆無忌憚的勢頭。對於香港來説，外圍環境在急速改變，我們的應對策略應該是甚麼？可以說是一套「不變」與「變」的組合拳：所謂「不變」，就是在「一國兩制下」維持香港自由港、零關稅地位，繼續維持資金、貨物、資訊和人才的自由流動，繼續歡迎全球各地的企業來港做生意、投資。

我記得去年四月七日，在美國宣布對全球差不多所有貿易夥伴徵收所謂「對等關稅」後，香港的股市一日之間下跌了超過3 000點。那天我和兩位局長和金管局、證監會的同事一同出來會見傳媒，就強調香港支持自由貿易的決心和承諾，決不動搖。為甚麼我們會這樣堅定？因為特區政府深信，信用和投資者、商界的信心，是最重要的。香港作為細小、全外向型的經濟體，我們靠的是香港「一國兩制」之下的制度優勢和可預期的經濟政策，讓全球的投資者和生意人可以安心在這裏投資興業。我們這個做法得到國際不同機構的認同：例如，香港繼續是全球最自由的經濟體；又被評為國際競爭力排名第三；三家主要的國際評級機構都給予香港「穩定」的評級展望。

事實上，香港去年錄得不少資金流入，港股升了28%，平均每日成交額接近2,500億元，較二○二四年增加近90%。IPO所籌集的資金在二○二五年超過2,800億元，按年增長逾兩倍，高踞全球第一。資產及財富管理亦錄得顯著的資金流入，銀行存款增加了約12%，至超過19萬億港元。這些當然背後有不同的原因，例如國家積極支持更多內地優質企業來港上市，吸引資金；國際投資者亦因DeepSeek而對中國的創科實力刮目相看，亦發現其開源的優勢、同時估值亦相當便宜，因此他們趕快加大在我們市場的資金配置。但同時，因應環球市場的不確定性，投資者因要分散風險，需找一個相對安全、資金可自由進出、他們亦熟悉其制度的地方停泊資金，香港是一個很自然的選擇。

剛才說是「不變」的地方，「變」的是甚麼？就是在大變局中準確識變、科學應變、主動求變。可以説，去年的變局為香港開啓了一些新機遇，我們要積極抓緊。例如在保護主義加劇之際，國家加強推動高水平對外開放，這是雙向的開放，一方面積極鼓勵內地企業出海，與區域內例如越南、馬來西亞、印尼這些東南亞國家有更深入的合作，並更深度參與全球產業鏈條和供應鏈的分工。另一方面，也繼續歡迎全球各地的企業和資金到中國投資興業。在這個過程中，香港有所受惠。去年貨物及服務出口都錄得大幅上升，商品出口貨值首11個月按年增長了14.3%，這是在關稅戰、貿易戰下不容易所取得的成績。而服務輸出亦受跨境金融、運輸及旅遊服務持續擴張帶動，首三季按年上升了7%。

出口以外，固定資本投資開支在首三季上升2.5%，這反映了企業相對看好經營前景而作出前置部署。普遍來說，企業積極進行自動化、數據化和數字化。資產市場復蘇及整體市場氣氛改善，令本地消費扭轉跌勢，零售業總銷貨價值連續第七個月錄得升幅，十一月按年上升6.5%。整體而言，我們估計二○二五年香港經濟增長會是3.2%，超出原先的預測區間2%至3%，增幅也較二○二四年加快，連續三年保持增長。

資產市場方面，股市和樓市「價量齊升」。股市我們剛才講了，至於樓市方面，住宅物業市場交投非常活躍，全年成交約62 000宗，創近四年的高位，過去幾個月，每個月都超過5 500宗。樓價在年內轉跌為升，首11個月上升3%，租金表現更為強韌，上升超過4%。商業房地產雖然面對較大的挑戰，但是我們也看到正面的訊號和預期：例如不少金融機構，尤其是從事資產和財富管理的國際金融機構，以及對沖基金等，增加租用寫字樓；亦看到有Web3——即數字資產——的企業把整棟大樓租用或買下來。

二○二六年展望

總的來説，二○二五年，香港可以説是在大變局中「頂住並挺住」。至於二○二六年的展望會是如何呢？我們的看法是「審慎樂觀」。

「審慎」，是因為我們面對的外圍風險相信只會增加，市場有可能大幅波動。我們很清楚看到，地緣政治變得更加複雜，個別主要經濟體的經濟、金融和貿易政策相當反覆，資本流向可能因此而急速轉變，這些對金融市場難免可能會造成震盪，進而衝擊實體經濟。在這背景下，特區政府會繼續統籌好安全與發展兩方面的工作。在國家的堅實支持下，我們一方面會高度警惕，特別是防範「黑天鵝」和「灰犀牛」的事件，同時亦會充分監測市場可能出現的風險，提早做好應對準備，化解風險於微時，特別是保障好金融安全方面。

而「樂觀」的原因，是因為香港經濟發展有不錯的勢頭。內地經濟穩步向前，而且基本面堅實、市場規模龐大、政策空間亦充裕，這些都會為香港經濟帶來有力的支持。消費和投資氣氛相信會改善，加上市場普遍預期美國在二○二六年會進一步減息，儘管減息幅度未必會很大，但對市場前景都是比較正面的因素，消費和投資活動有望擴張。

對接「十五五」規劃

今年，香港經濟估計會繼續穩中有進。但要持續發展，我們必須進行改革，要「求變」，在變局中開創新機遇。今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，《十五五規劃建議》公布後，其中有幾個重點對於香港來説是值得特別留意的：一是國家擴大高水平雙向開放，二是高水平科技自立自強，三是優化區域經濟布局，四是加快經濟社會發展全面綠色轉型。

《建議》很明確地提到，支持港澳更好融入和服務國家發展大局，這與以往的說法——香港積極融入國家發展大局——是有進一步的意義。不單止要融入，更是要貢獻和服務國家發展的大局，而在過程之中，香港亦都因應自身的優勢取得更好的發展。服務國家發展大局，彰顯了香港對於國家的重要性和貢獻可以不斷提升，同時，國家亦期待我們更好以自身所長、服務國家所需。

《建議》也提到鞏固提升香港國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位，支持香港建設國際創新科技中心；也支持香港打造國際高端人才集聚高地。

對於香港來説，在「十五五」規劃中，離不開用好香港「內聯外通」的獨特優勢和國際化的特色，豐富「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色和功能。簡單而言，傳統的優勢產業和市場，我們必須鞏固好，並注入新的發展內涵；同時亦要開拓新市場、發展新興產業、培育新的發展動能。

以金融業為例，香港目前是全球第三的國際金融中心，跟紐約和倫敦的距離正在拉近，而去年我們的IPO是全球第一。但即使在這些優勢領域，我們都要加倍努力，例如在股票市場中，如何進一步優化上市制度、優化市場結構和交易機制？如何讓股票市場更國際化，成為不止是內地企業的首選上市地，也是海外，譬如是中東、東南亞企業的首選上市地？如何更多元化發展這個國際金融中心？例如在資產和財富管理方面，如何在更短的時間內超越瑞士，成為全球最大的跨境資產和財富管理中心。又例如在綠色金融方面，如何將香港發展成為世界最大的綠色金融中心？又例如，如何拓展固定收益及貨幣市場，以及金融科技等？

人民幣在全球跨境貿易結算的地位正在逐步提升，亦有不少國家在其儲備貨幣中增加持有人民幣。我們要大力推動人民幣業務在香港的發展，進一步鞏固和提升香港離岸人民幣業務樞紐地位。我們會從三方面做好這方面的工作，包括提升離岸人民幣的流動性、優化離岸人民幣的金融基建，以及豐富人民幣投資和風險管理產品。

貿易方面，順應內地企業「出海」拓展業務的大潮，香港要積極構建跨國供應鏈管理中心和貿易融資中心，為「出海」的企業提供供應鏈管理、貿易融資、財資管理、專業服務、合規諮詢、企業培訓等多方面的支持。就此，特區政府在去年十月成立了「內地企業出海專班」，集結公私營機構的力量，主動出擊，做好服務。此外，我們亦會主動組團——不單止是香港的代表團，而是香港加上內地相關省市的一些企業，一起「出海」到不同地方，除了做生意，亦進行投資。

創科是新興產業的最重要部分。新一輪的科技變革，特別是人工智能，成為新的經濟增長動力，亦重新定義不同經濟體的競爭力。我們正培育一些具競爭優勢的新領域，其中人工智能和生物科技是有很大優勢的領域。

就人工智能而言，特區政府會採取雙管齊下的策略：一方面，將人工智能培育為核心產業；另一方面，以人工智能賦能傳統行業，以提升生產力、效率和競爭力，即「AI+」。這包括從算力、算法、數據、開發應用、資金支持，以及人才培育等六個方面推動其發展。其中，提升整個社會對人工智能的認識和素養，讓人工智能成為各行各業和市民的工具，而不是恐懼。這個是特區政府未來的工作重點之一。

另一個香港具有優勢的新產業是生物醫藥。除了支持高水平的醫療科研和吸引世界級藥企落戶香港外，我們目前正在建立「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制，使香港能夠獨立評估和批准醫療產品與器械，這對於我們進一步發展成具全球影響力的醫療和醫藥科技樞紐非常重要。

北部都會區是香港創科發展的重要載體，也是香港與粵港澳大灣區兄弟城市合作、聯動發展的重要基地。特區政府正全方位加快北都的建設，以靈活的發展模式、專屬的法例、行政上的拆牆鬆綁，加上投資的優惠政策包，例如土地批撥、比較相宜的地價、資助計劃和稅務減免優惠等，吸引高增值產業和高潛力企業落戶北都，帶來技術、就業和相關的高增值製造業。而剛在上月開幕的河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區，將與深圳園區試行人員、物資、資金和數據這四項要素的便捷流動，這將對海內外人工智能和生物醫藥的企業具有巨大的吸引力。

最後一提的是人才，人才是創新之本，推動教育科技人才一體化也是「十五五規劃」的重要方向。除了吸引全球的頂尖人才來港，我們也要積極培養和壯大本地的創科人才庫。包括從小培養學生對創科的興趣，以及鼓勵和協助大學生投身創科行業，打造一個充滿活力、利於創新、包容開放的發展環境。

新一份財政預算案

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，二○二六至二七年度《財政預算案》的公眾諮詢正在進行，我們期望大家就着預算案多給意見我們，大家一起凝聚力量，為香港譜寫出更亮麗的發展新篇章。亦借這個機會衷心祝願大家新一年身體健康、工作愉快、所願皆成，多謝大家。"

  The annual Joint Meeting has long been a platform for senior medical and health officials as well as experts from the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao to exchange views and share experiences on present-day medical and public health issues, as well as to promote healthcare service development. The Joint Meeting is hosted by the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao in rotation.

  The Minister of the National Health Commission, Mr Lei Haichao, and the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture of the Macao SAR Government, Ms O Lam, led senior health officials from the Mainland and the Macao SAR Government respectively to participate in the meeting. Members of the delegations of the three places today engaged in sharing and discussions over three major topics, namely nurturing interdisciplinary and composite talent in clinical management, disease prevention and control, and medical administration; strengthening primary healthcare services to safeguard community health, and the application of smart healthcare in the health sector.

  Professor Lo said, ""The Recommendations of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, adopted at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, features the term 'reform' 23 times, unequivocally underscoring the nation's steadfast commitment to deepening reforms. Hong Kong has consistently been playing an active role in the course of the country's reform and opening up. Serving as a 'super connector' between the Mainland and the world, Hong Kong also functions as an indispensable 'super value-adder', facilitating the nation's effort in going global while attracting foreign investment to the Mainland market.

  ""The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has consistently emphasised in the Policy Addresses of the past three years the HKSAR Government's full commitment to developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub, and to vigorously foster new quality productive forces. To achieve this significant objective, the HKSAR Government is actively advancing various initiatives, including the setting up of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation within this year, with a view to establishing the Centre as an internationally recognised regulatory authority for medical products as soon as possible; the official launch of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform last month, enabling pharmaceutical companies to conduct trials simultaneously in Hong Kong and Shenzhen; as well as the commissioning of the Real-World Study and Application Centre to promote the standardisation of clinical data across the GBA.""

  The Chief Executive of the Hospital Authority (HA), Dr Libby Lee, and the Director of Cluster Services of the HA, Dr Wong Yiu-chung, moderated a discussion and gave a presentation on the application of smart healthcare in the health sector respectively. Meanwhile, the acting Deputy Director of Health, Dr Jackie Leung, and the Commissioner for Primary Healthcare, Dr Pang Fei-chau, delivered presentations on the topic of nurturing interdisciplinary and composite talent in clinical management, disease prevention and control, and medical administration; as well as on the topic of strengthening primary healthcare services to safeguard community health respectively.

  Members of the HKSAR Government delegation included the Chairman of the HA, Mr Henry Fan, and the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, who concluded the discussion at the meeting.

  Professor Lo will return to Hong Kong in the evening. During his absence, the Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, is the Acting Secretary for Health."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-15 17:30,2026-01-15 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/15/P2026011500524.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月十五日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
​
市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-15 17:30,2026-01-15 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/15/P2026011500527.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 15), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

Hong Kong Customs special operation combats sale of counterfeit luxury fashion products (with photo),2026-01-15 17:30,2026-01-15 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/15/P2026011500414.htm,"Hong Kong Customs mounted a special operation in Hung Hom and Quarry Bay between January 6 and 14 to combat the sale of counterfeit luxury fashion products. About 1 000 suspected counterfeit goods, including apparel, shoes, handbags and jewellery, with an estimated market value of about $7.3 million, were seized. Two persons were arrested.

Through intelligence analysis, Customs earlier discovered a retail shop in Hung Hom selling suspected counterfeit luxury fashion products. Customs officers then took enforcement action and raided the retail shop and its storage facility. About 400 pieces of suspected counterfeit apparel, with an estimated market value of about $700,000, were seized.

In addition, Customs earlier received information alleging that suspected counterfeit apparel was put on sale at a retail shop in Quarry Bay. After detailed investigations and with the assistance of the trademark owners, Customs officers took enforcement action and raided the retail shop. About 600 suspected counterfeit apparel items, with an estimated market value of about $6,600,000, were seized.

During the operation, two female shop owners, aged 48 and 53, were arrested.

The investigation is ongoing, and the likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

With the Lunar New Year around the corner, Customs will continue to step up inspections and enforcement to vigorously combat different kinds of counterfeiting activities.

Customs reminds consumers to procure goods at reputable shops and to check with the trademark owners or their authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt. Traders should also be cautious and prudent in merchandising since selling counterfeit goods is a serious crime and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who sells or possesses for sale any goods with a forged trademark commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected counterfeiting activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 1828080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
​一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2026-01-15 17:15,2026-01-15 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/15/P2026011500541.htm,"一名入境女旅客因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（一月十五日）在粉嶺裁判法院被判處監禁三個月及罰款一千五百元。

海關人員於昨日（一月十四日）在羅湖管制站截查該名四十一歲抵港女旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲五千一百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約二萬一千元，應課稅值約一萬七千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，反映即使旅客屬初犯，亦可能被判處監禁，刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2026-01-15 17:15,2026-01-15 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/15/P2026011500539.htm,"An incoming female passenger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (January 15) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming 41-year-old female passenger by the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (January 14) and seized 5 181 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $21,000 and a duty potential of about $17,000 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.
