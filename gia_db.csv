選管會主席視察​多場二○二五年立法會換屆選舉工作人員簡介會和實習訓練（附圖）,2025-11-19 20:35,2025-11-19 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900645.htm,"下稿代選舉管理委員會發出：

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日（星期日）舉行。選舉事務處過去數星期為負責不同崗位的選舉工作人員舉辦多場簡介會和實習訓練，加深他們對發票及點票程序和各項細節的了解。選舉管理委員會主席陸啟康法官視察了其中三場分別於十月二十七日、昨日（十一月十八日）和今日（十一月十九日）舉行的簡介會和實習訓練，親身了解選舉工作人員的準備工作。

今日的培訓是為投票日在中央點票站點算功能界別選票的工作人員而設。是次立法會換屆選舉功能界別選舉將首次引入電子點票系統進行點票，在確保選舉公開、誠實和公平進行的同時，應用科技提升點票效率。選舉事務處今日為相關工作人員安排深入培訓及聯合演練，涵蓋由票箱抵達中央點票站直至點票完成的各項細節，以及後備應變方案，務求讓整個點票過程準確而高效地完成。

而昨日，選舉事務處為負責在一般投票兼點票站發票及為地方選區點票的工作人員舉行實習訓練，讓他們熟習以電子選民登記冊系統及其後備模式發票，以及地方選區的人手點票流程等，確保工作人員充分掌握投票兼點票站的運作安排。

至於參加十月二十七日簡介會的工作人員於投票日主要負責選舉委員會界別選舉點票工作。選舉事務處代表向工作人員簡介了選舉委員會界別的點票工作流程，和所採用的電子點票系統，並示範點票機和相關系統的操作，提高工作人員對該界別點票工作的認識。

陸啟康法官今日在視察後表示，近期的簡介會和一連串實習訓練有效加強工作人員對相關工作流程和系統操作的認識。他衷心感謝工作人員的努力，並鼓勵他們繼續全力以赴，以確保投票日當天所有發票及點票工作順利進行。

選管會委員石丹理教授和文本立資深大律師亦有聯同陸啟康法官視察十月二十七日的簡介會和今日的培訓。

是次立法會換屆選舉的投票結束後，大部分一般投票站會立即轉換為點票站，用以點算地方選區選票。所有功能界別及選委會界別的票箱則會被運送到位於香港會議展覽中心的中央點票站，以電子點票系統進行點票。由於投票和點票安排涉及多個不同步驟，選舉事務處會繼續為選舉工作人員舉辦更多培訓和模擬演練，以提升他們的協調和應變能力，為是次選舉作周詳而充分的準備。"
EAC Chairman inspects briefing and training sessions for electoral staff of 2025 Legislative Council General Election (with photos),2025-11-19 20:35,2025-11-19 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900648.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Electoral Affairs Commission:

 The 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE) will be held on December 7 (Sunday). The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) has arranged in the past few weeks a number of briefings and training sessions for electoral staff responsible for different duties to enhance their understanding of the polling and counting procedures and various details. The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC), Mr Justice David Lok, inspected three of these briefings and training sessions, which took place on October 27, yesterday (November 18) and today (November 19) respectively, to see for himself the preparatory work by electoral staff.

 Today's hands-on practice was designed for the electoral staff responsible for counting duties for functional constituencies (FCs) at the Central Counting Station (CCS) on the polling day. The electronic counting system was introduced for the first time for the FCs in the 2025 LCGE, with the aim of ensuring that the election will be conducted openly, honestly and fairly, while at the same time applying technology to enhance the counting efficiency. Today's practice, arranged by the REO, primarily provided the relevant staff with enhanced training and joint drills, covering hands-on practices on each step of the entire process from the arrival of ballot boxes at the CCS to the completion of counting, as well as the fallback contingency measures, to ensure that the counting process will be conducted in an accurate and efficient manner.

 As for yesterday, the REO conducted a training session for the staff responsible for issuing ballot papers and counting duties for geographical constituencies (GCs) at the normal polling-cum-counting stations, enabling them to familiarise themselves with issuing ballot papers using the Electronic Poll Register System and its fallback mode, as well as the manual counting process for GCs, thereby ensuring that they fully understand the arrangements of the polling-cum-counting stations.

 The staff participating in the briefing on October 27 are mainly responsible for counting duties for the Election Committee constituency (ECC) on the polling day. Representatives from the REO briefed the staff on the counting workflow and the electronic counting system to be adopted for the ECC, followed by a demonstration on the operation of the counting machine and the relevant system to enhance the staff's knowledge of the counting duties for that constituency.

Mr Justice Lok said after the inspection today that the recent briefings and series of training sessions could effectively enhance the staff's knowledge of the relevant workflow and system operations. He thanked the staff wholeheartedly for their hard work and encouraged them to continue to exert themselves to enable smooth polling and counting on the polling day.

 EAC members Professor Daniel Shek and Mr Bernard Man, SC, also inspected the briefing on October 27 and the hands-on practice today with Mr Justice Lok.

 After the close of poll of the 2025 LCGE, a majority of the Ordinary Polling Stations will be converted into counting stations immediately for the counting of GC votes, while the ballot boxes of all FCs and the ECC will be delivered to the CCS at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre for counting with the electronic counting system. As the polling and counting arrangements involve multiple procedures, the REO will continue to arrange more training sessions and simulation exercises for the electoral staff to enhance their co-ordination and response capabilities for making a detailed and comprehensive preparation for the LCGE."
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as severe paediatric influenza infection case was recorded in two consecutive days,2025-11-19 20:08,2025-11-19 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900694.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 19) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP reiterated its appeal to urge schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 12-year-old boy with good past health. He attended the United Christian Hospital on November 15 due to his other medical condition and was admitted for treatment. He developed a fever and cough on November 18. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with shock. He remains hospitalised in the paediatric intensive care unitand is in serious condition.

The boy had not yet received the 2025/26 SIV and had no travel history recently. His household contact is currently asymptomatic and no influenza outbreaks have been reported at his school recently.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 20 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including two fatal cases. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years. Eleven cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity began to decline in the last week of October. However, it remains at a relatively high level. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, at nearly 16 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

運輸署發言人說：「署方一直於廉政公署調查案件期間提供全面協助，並已按調查結果取消相關人士的香港駕駛執照。調查仍在進行中。特區政府強調，香港與認可國家和地方的免試簽發駕駛執照安排基於互認原則、互惠基礎。政府絕不容忍任何人，不論香港內外，以詐騙行為取得駕駛執照，影響道路安全和道路使用者的信心。」

署方重申，一直嚴謹處理及核實每宗免試簽發的申請，以確保申請人符合法例要求，並適時檢視免試簽發的申請流程，配合申請需求及運作需要。在審批過程中，如對申請人提交的證明文件有懷疑，署方會嚴肅跟進，包括聯絡有關的領事館或運輸部門查證，以確認所涉文件的真偽。運輸署會待資料獲得核實後才處理相關申請。如確認申請人未能完全符合申請條件及規定，運輸署會拒絕有關申請。

TD collaborates with ICAC in investigation into eight persons who applied for direct issue of Hong Kong driving licence using false documents,2025-11-19 19:56,2025-11-19 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900561.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) today (November 19) said that it was collaborating with the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in an investigation into a case involving eight persons using false documents to apply for the direct issue of the Hong Kong Full Driving Licence.

A spokesman for the TD said, ""The TD rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case and has cancelled the Hong Kong driving licences of the persons concerned based on the investigation findings. The investigation is ongoing. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region stresses that the 'direct issue' arrangements in Hong Kong with the recognised countries or places are operated on the principles of mutual recognition and reciprocity. The Government has zero tolerance against anyone in or outside Hong Kong obtaining a driving licence through fraudulent activities, thereby jeopardising road safety and the confidence of road users.""

The TD reaffirms that every ""direct issue"" application is rigorously processed and verified to ensure that applicants meet the legal requirements. The TD also reviews the application process for ""direct issue"" as appropriate to cope with the application demand and operational requirements. During the vetting process, in case of doubts about the supporting documents submitted by the applicant, the TD will seriously follow up, including approaching the relevant consulate or transport authority for verification to ensure the authenticity of the documents. The TD will only process such applications after the information has been verified. If the applicant does not fully meet the application eligibility and requirements, the TD will reject the application.

According to section 111(3) of the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374), any person who makes any false statement for the purpose of obtaining any driving licence commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for six months. The TD will continue to strictly monitor the implementation of the ""direct issue"" arrangements and review the relevant procedures with reference to the corruption prevention advice provided by the ICAC. The TD will refer any suspected case to law enforcement agencies for follow-up investigations."

Successful applicants shall comply with all the stipulations and provisions as set out in the licence agreement. An FEHD spokesman stressed that the public should not assign, sublet, transfer or otherwise part with any of the benefits or obligations of the licence agreement of the LNY fair stalls. Otherwise, the department is entitled to terminate the agreement and the licensee shall immediately vacate the stall.

All fair sites will be made available to the licensees three days in advance of the fairs (from February 8 to 10, 2026) for the setting up of stalls. In the event of any unforeseeable incident that will cause a shortening of the whole licence period (including the duration for setting up stalls and the business period of the fair), the Government has the right to postpone the commencement date and shorten the duration of the period. The let out price (licence fee) paid will be refunded to the licensee on a pro-rata basis without interest.

Stall licensees must completely remove the stall structure and all paraphernalia, together with all refuse, debris and unsold commodities (whether damaged or otherwise), from the licensed area before 7am on February 17, 2026 (9am for the Victoria Park LNY Fair).

The FEHD reminded licensees that the stalls are solely for the purpose of selling and promoting the sale of the permitted commodities, and no other activities are allowed in the licensed area. If the FEHD considers that any activity conducted by the licensee to publicise, promote, display, show or sell any permitted commodities in the venue is unlawful, contrary to the interest of national security, immoral or incompatible with the object of the LNY fair, the FEHD is entitled to direct the licensee to stop conducting such activities and the licensee must immediately comply with the direction.

Stall licensees should not destroy, damage or abandon any unsold commodities at or in the vicinity of the stall.They may surrender unsold flowers and plants left behind at the stall to the FEHD at no charge, cost or compensation whatsoever, before 7am on February 17, 2026 (9am for the Victoria Park LNY Fair).

According to the licence agreement, except inside designated stalls, licensees must not keep, store or use any compressed helium cylinder in the licensed area. Whereas licensees of the designated stalls may keep, store or use helium cylinders in the licensed area, the quantity of helium should be such that a licence is not required pursuant to the Dangerous Goods (Application and Exemption) Regulation 2012 (Cap. 295E), i.e. equivalent to 150 litres of helium. Sales of floatable LED glowing balloons and aquarium fish by stall licensees are prohibited at the LNY fairs.

In addition, as stated in the licence agreement, the height of dry goods stalls must not exceed 3 metres from ground level. The height of wet goods stalls and fast food stalls must not exceed 4.5m from ground level. For wet goods stalls and fast food stalls with a height of more than 3m from ground level, the licensee must, at their own costs, provide the FEHD with the original certificate issued by an authorised person, a registered structural engineer, or a competent person under the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations (Cap. 59I) to certify the structural safety of the structure in the licensed area before the fair is opened to the public. The licensee must also affix a copy of the aforesaid certificate on the structure of the stall. Also, each corner and anchor point of the marquee (if any) shall be securely fastened using appropriate ballast weights, such as sandbags or purpose-designed marquee water weights. During the period when the Strong Monsoon Signal is in force or to be issued, the licensee shall immediately inspect the stall and adopt reinforcement measures as necessary.

​香港海關搗破三個懷疑私煙銷售點（附圖）,2025-11-19 19:00,2025-11-19 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900632.htm,"香港海關今日（十一月十九日）採取反私煙執法行動，搗破三個懷疑私煙銷售點，包括兩個位於葵芳及荃灣的報攤及一個位於荃灣的士多，檢獲共約三千八百支懷疑私煙，估計市值約一萬七千元，應課稅值約一萬三千元，並拘捕三人。

根據新修訂的《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），任何售價低於煙草稅的香煙必須證明已課稅，否則將被推定為未完稅香煙。在新修訂的《條例》生效後，海關亦加強執法，打擊私煙銷售點，並密切留意市場情況，在全港各區巡查。

而海關近日發現仍有部分香煙銷售點以低於煙草稅的價格出售香煙，遂於今日採取執法行動，在上述的報攤和士多檢獲共約三千八百支懷疑私煙，拘捕兩名女子和一名男子，包括兩名店主及一名售貨員，年齡介乎五十二至六十五歲。

海關呼籲各零售商切勿售賣來歷不明的香煙，對來貨價低於煙草稅的香煙，必須提高警覺，以避免刑事責任。

海關提醒零售商和市民，根據《條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Hong Kong Customs raids three suspected illicit cigarette sales outlets (with photos),2025-11-19 19:00,2025-11-19 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900634.htm,"  Hong Kong Customs mounted an anti-illicit cigarette enforcement operation today (November 19) and raided three suspected illicit cigarette sales outlets, including two newsstands in Kwai Fong and Tsuen Wan, as well as one store in Tsuen Wan, seizing a total of about 3 800 suspected illicit cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $17,000 and a duty potential of about $13,000. Three persons were arrested.

  According to the amended Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO), cigarettes sold at a price lower than the tobacco duty must be proven to be duty-paid, otherwise the cigarettes are presumed to be duty-not-paid. After the amended DCO took effect, Customs has also strengthened enforcement actions to combat illegal cigarette sales outlets, and has been closely monitoring the market situation and stepping up patrols in various districts.

  Noting that there were still cigarette sales outlets selling cigarettes at a price lower than the tobacco duty, Customs officers took enforcement actions today and seized about 3 800 suspected illicit cigarettes in the abovementioned newsstands and store. Two women and one man, comprising two newsstand owners and one employee, aged between 52 and 65 were arrested.

  Customs appeals to retailers not to sell cigarettes of unknown sources. They must stay vigilant against cigarettes with a wholesale price lower than the tobacco duty in order to avoid criminal liability.

  Customs reminds retailers and members of the public that under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

The Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) promulgated the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering last November, outlining five strategies and 10 actions to develop Hong Kong into a centre for green maritime fuel bunkering. Among the measures in the Action Plan is the establishment of a collaborative platform for the industry to support the development of effective supply chains and trading channels. The newly launched Communication Platform is a major initiative to foster industry collaboration, bringing together upstream and downstream companies within the green maritime fuel bunkering supply chain, including fuel suppliers, shipping companies, and port operators, among others. In addition to gathering views from Communication Platform members regarding the development of green maritime fuel bunkering and trading in Hong Kong, the Government will organise networking activities and government-facilitated business meetings to enhance stakeholder communication and co-operation, thereby expediting the establishment of a complete and resilient green maritime fuel bunkering supply chain in Hong Kong.

The Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, said at today's International Bunker Industry Association Annual Convention, ""The Communication Platform aims to facilitate business discussion and collect views from the trade on ways to bolster our competitiveness in green maritime fuel bunkering and trading. We warmly welcome all interested Hong Kong companies, as well as Mainland and foreign companies with a presence in Hong Kong, to join the Communication Platform and develop Hong Kong into a premier green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre together.""

Currently, 25 companies and industry organisations have joined the Communication Platform. The TLB encourages more companies and industry organisations involved in green maritime fuel bunkering to join and explore business opportunities together. Details about the Communication Platform and application forms can be obtained from the TLB website:www.tlb.gov.hk/eng/boards/transport/maritime/gmfdlg.html."

運輸及物流局於去年十一月公布《綠色船用燃料加注行動綱領》，訂定五大策略及十項行動，目標把香港發展成為綠色船用燃料加注中心。其中，《行動綱領》提出為業界提供合作平台，以協助建立有效的供應鏈和交易渠道。新成立的交流平台正是促進業界合作的重要舉措。交流平台匯聚綠色船用燃料加注供應鏈的上、下游企業，包括燃料供應商、航運企業及港口營運商等。政府除了會聽取交流平台的企業對在香港發展綠色船用燃料加注和交易業務的意見，亦會透過舉辦不同的交流活動和由政府促成的業務會議等，促進相關持份者的溝通協作，以加快在香港建立完整和具韌性的綠色船用燃料加注供應鏈。

運輸及物流局局長陳美寶在今日的國際燃料工業協會年會上表示：「交流平台旨在促進業界討論，收集意見，以提升香港在綠色船用燃料加注和交易方面的競爭力。我們歡迎所有有興趣的香港公司，以及在香港開展業務的內地和海外公司加入交流平台，共同將香港打造成區內首屈一指的綠色船用燃料加注和交易中心。」

連續兩日錄得兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-19 18:32,2025-11-19 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900619.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十九日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，再次敦促學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的12歲男童。他於十一月十五日因其他自身疾病到基督教聯合醫院求醫，需留院治理，於十一月十八日出現發燒及咳嗽。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克，目前在兒童深切治療部留醫，情況嚴重。

男童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗，近期不曾外遊。他的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，他就讀的學校近日亦沒有爆發流感。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得20宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括兩宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的11宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度在十月最後一周開始回落，但仍然處於較高水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近16%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

DCS chairs 10th meeting of Task Force on District Governance (with photos),2025-11-19 18:26,2025-11-19 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900562.htm," The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, chaired the 10th meeting of the Task Force on District Governance today (November 19) to follow up on the initiatives in accordance with the work assigned by the Steering Committee on District Governance. The meeting co-ordinated various departments in formulating specific implementation measures on issues of local concern and continuously reviewed the work progress and performance.

 Mr Cheuk said, ""With the concerted efforts of all departments, various measures have been steadily implemented in accordance with the overall strategies set by the Steering Committee, effectively improving environmental hygiene, enhancing community development, and strengthening district services. The Task Force will continue to co-ordinate departments in stepping up the speed and efficiency in addressing a range of pressing district concerns, continuously improving people's livelihood and well-being.""

 The Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration has formulated strategies for 12 district issues (Note), including various measures to strengthen community support. These initiatives actively address the needs of the public and seek to enhance their quality of life and satisfaction. At the meeting, the Task Force followed up on the implementation progress and outcomes of relevant initiatives. These include: 200 primary schools have participated in the School-based After School Care Service Scheme, providing a total of about 10 600 service places; the Government has launched the first phase of the Carer Support Data Platform, which integrates the data of the Housing Department and the Social Welfare Department to identify high-risk cases with relatively limited community support, with Care Teams having visited or reached out to over 18 000 singleton and doubleton elderly households, carers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities and referred more than 900 cases to social welfare service units as of end-October; the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has taken enforcement actions against shopfront extension under the Public Health and Municipal Services (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 to safeguard environmental hygiene; as of September 30, the FEHD has issued over 7 000 ""Statutory Nuisance Notices"" in response to environmental nuisances caused by air-conditioner water dripping, with the vast majority of cases already rectified; and relevant departments continue to improve the waiting environment at public transport interchanges, including the ventilation system and lighting.

 Mr Cheuk thanked all departments for their dedicated efforts in advancing the above work and achieving notable results. He urged all departments to uphold the spirit of unity and pragmatism and to continue actively following up on various livelihood-related issues, effectively enhancing the quality of life and well-being of the public.

The Government is making full preparations for the Legislative Council General Election to be held on December 7. As an important election following the enhancement of the district governance system, it carries significant implications for Hong Kong's community development, economic growth and people's livelihood. Mr Cheuk directed heads of departments to put in place comprehensive arrangements and ensure close co-ordination, carrying out all related tasks in a thorough, detailed and pragmatic manner. He requested all departments to provide practicable facilitation measures to support staff in voting and to make good use of government district facilities and networks to widely disseminate messages encouraging voter turnout. These efforts will help deepen public understanding of the election and the importance of voting, motivating citizens to cast their ballots and elect capable and committed Members of the Legislative Council who will contribute to community development and Hong Kong's prosperity and progress.

Note: The 12 key issues are: (1) expanding after-school care and enhancing support for parents; (2) caring for the elderly and enhancing community support; (3) fostering clean markets and mobilising the community to participate in anti-rodent work; (4) enhancing public order and combating crimes on all fronts; (5) improving pedestrian facilities and ensuring road safety; (6) enhancing the community environment and strengthening local characteristics ; (7) improving the environment of public housing estates and creating comfortable homes; (8) caring for the elderly and promoting digital inclusion; (9) improving the waiting environment at public transport interchanges to enhance the travel experience; (10) combating air-conditioner water dripping to improve community environment; (11) cleaning pedestrian walkways to improve city streets; (12) strengthening thematic planting."
Incoming male passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-11-19 18:10,2025-11-19 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900581.htm,"  An incoming male passenger was sentenced to two months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (November 19) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

  A 55-year-old incoming male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on November 18. During customs clearance, Customs officers seized about 10 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $44,000 and a duty potential of about $36,000, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

  Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Speech by STL at Greater Bay Maritime Forum 2025 (with photo),2025-11-19 17:58,2025-11-19 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900552.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Greater Bay Maritime Forum 2025 today (November 19):

Ladies and gentlemen,

I am delighted to join you this morning at the Greater Bay Maritime Forum 2025. Today's forum serves as an excellent platform for us to exchange ideas and insights regarding the advancement of the maritime sector, particularly in providing the vast opportunities presented by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) development.

The Recommendations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, revealed just last month, reaffirmed the Central Government's full support for Hong Kong's efforts in enhancing our status as an international maritime centre. More specifically, the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area supports enhancing the overall international competitiveness of the Pearl River Delta port cluster and emphasises the importance of a complementary and mutually beneficial port system to foster synergy.

The theme of today's forum is ""Internal Integration and External Connectivity for Multiple Wins"". I think there is indeed no better place to delve into this topic than here in Hong Kong.

Building upon Hong Kong's unique advantages, we have been and will continue to be the maritime ""super-connector"" within the GBA region. Our strategy has been to leverage our competitive advantages as a free port - renowned for its efficiency, strong connectivity and the strategic development of Hong Kong and contribution to the GBA, as well as, most important of all, our position as the two-way springboard connecting the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world.

As outlined in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address in September, the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government is set to implement a series of new measures to propel our maritime sector forward. One key measure involves actively establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal transport system by promoting intermodal cargo transport with the Chinese Mainland's inland provinces, such as Chongqing, Guangxi, and perhaps Jiangxi, Hunan and Yunnan. All these provinces on the Mainland have an abundant supply of raw materials as well as cargo products that we have longed for. These resource-rich provinces can fully leverage Hong Kong's global connectivity network to flexibly transfer goods worldwide, while simultaneously attracting more cargo sources to Hong Kong and improving its appeal as a hub for cargo consolidation and transshipment, thus creating a win-win situation.

To further strengthen regional collaboration and global connections, we are actively pursuing to establish an international ""partner port"" network by building strategic partnerships with ports on the Chinese Mainland and in the Belt and Road countries. I am happy to share with you - and perhaps I need not stress this because you should have got all the information through the press over the past few days - that we have just signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with the San Antonio Port of Chile, as well as Guangxi and Dalian on the Chinese Mainland, as our first batch of ""partner ports"". By strengthening the port connections with our overseas and Chinese Mainland port partners, it will not only allow us to foster new collaboration, exchange best practices, and improve trade and logistics efficiency, but also help solidify Hong Kong's position as a premier international shipping centre right in the GBA region, thereby enhancing the overall competitiveness of the region. I can assure you, Hong Kong is not just looking for benefits for ourselves; I think our growth and competitiveness are intertwined with the growth and competitiveness of all the ports, neighbouring cities, and airports in the rest of the GBA area. We should synergise and foster collaboration in order to help ourselves grow even stronger. We are therefore keen to further collaboration with other ports in the GBA as well.

Following the success of the Mainland-Hong Kong Green Energy Matchmaking Event, which was organised between Hong Kong and the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China just in June this year, which was very attractive and successful and attended by over 300 representatives from local, overseas and Chinese Mainland companies all involved in the green energy business, we advanced our collaboration efforts by launching the Green Maritime Fuel Development Communication Platform that will soon be promulgated in the coming days, so as to connect industry players across the entire green maritime fuel supply chain. We look forward to business deals catalysed by the platform, thereby expediting the establishment of a green maritime fuel business ecosystem that will underpin our prominence in the green shipping era.

In addition, we are stepping up efforts to promote smart port operations and data interconnection among the maritime and port industry through a digitalised Port Community System, PCS, which will be officially launched early next year. But we couldn't wait - notwithstanding the official launch to be held early next year, we are already connecting with different suppliers, stakeholders in the supply chain of logistics and shipping, and, more importantly, we are also collaborating with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on a Project CargoË£ scheme in order to help all our enterprises, whether they are small, medium, or big, ride on and leverage this digitalised port system for trade finance and also blockchain to trace the cargo for more efficient cargo operation and even custom clearance in a more seamless way.

This digital collaborative platform will provide cargo tracking functions and connect sea, land and air transport networks, enhancing cross-sector information interconnectivity and increasing the Hong Kong Port's efficiency and overall competitiveness. We signed an MOU with the Guangdong e-Port in May 2025, which facilitates system and data connectivity to provide the ""One-Data-Multiple-Declarations"" function for cross-border logistics and offer pre-filling and pre-submission of shipping manifests for vessels entering the GBA region. We will continue to expand the functionalities of the PCS and explore enhancing co-operation with other Chinese Mainland ports. Actually, on Monday's (November 17) ALMAC (Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference) VIP luncheon, we witnessed a B2B (business-to-business) MOU signing between our two port operators with the Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group Company Limited, and that also leveraged our digitalised data sharing system and clearance for customs.

Today, I would also like to express my warmest congratulations to the Maritime Talent Cultivation Alliance on its establishment. Uniting 16 renowned academics and maritime associations, the establishment of the Alliance marks a significant step in maritime talent development by bridging the industry, academia, research, and investment sectors, fostering the sustainable growth of the industry. I really look forward to the Alliance achieving remarkable progress and discovering new avenues for growth in Hong Kong.

Ladies and gentlemen, the initiatives I just highlighted are not stand-alone efforts; they represent the direct and active implementation of Hong Kong's commitment to consolidating and enhancing our status as an international maritime centre. As you can see from the past 24 months - or perhaps 12 months - the energy and drive demonstrated by the Hong Kong SAR Government, in particular my bureau and also the Marine Department, is evident. This is not happening in isolation. It is an act of strong determination and strong drive with the support and strong backing of the maritime and shipping industry, including the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, the maritime industry, and long-established shipping tycoons in Hong Kong, whom we also treasure.

I believe that through our close partnership with the Chinese Mainland, we will continue to contribute to the strategic development framework of our country. While the global maritime industry continues to experience its ebb and flow, I am confident that by working together, we in this region, with the Chinese Mainland as our strong backup, we can not only ride the tide but also chart the course ahead. My congratulations, once again, on the inauguration of the Maritime Talent Cultivation Alliance, and I wish you all a very successful and fruitful forum. I look forward to seeing you all at this forum next year. Thank you very much.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-19 17:37,2025-11-19 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900576.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 19),no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 64 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases. Regarding the recently announced local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan,the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch has completed genome analysis of the patient. The result indicated that the genetic sequence of her viral sample differed from those of other imported CF cases recorded in Hong Kong and the three local CF cases in Wong Tai Sin and Tsing Yi, suggesting separate sources of infection. The CHP cannot rule out the possibility that an earlier, undiagnosed patient in an area visited by the patient transmitted the virus to mosquitoes, which then infected her.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

In light of the above local case, the CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of the patient's residence to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 950 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past four days. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus. The operating hours of the booth will be adjusted based on actual needs. Please refer to the CHP'swebpagefor the actual operating hours of the health consultation booth.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Speech by STL at International Bunker Industry Association Annual Convention 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-11-19 13:21,2025-11-19 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900339.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) Annual Convention 2025 today (November 19):

Constantinos (Chair of the IBIA and Bunker Director at the Star Bulk Carriers, Mr Constantinos Capetanakis), Alexander (Executive Director of the IBIA, Mr Alexander Prokopakis), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and many friends, old and new,

  Welcome again to Hong Kong. Today is getting a little bit cold and I know that every one of you has made an effort to arrive here to make it for this forum. I can assure you that with the Chair's remarks, you would have a lot of takeaways from this forum this morning. It is actually a distinct honour for Hong Kong to host the IBIA's premier flagship event here for the very first time. Judging from what Constantinos just said, I think Hong Kong and the IBIA share a lot of the same vision. I truly agree with the particular phrase you mentioned that we need leadership and we need action and solutions, rather than just rules or discussions inside closed doors, we need to go to the ground. We also need to lead everybody for a joint solution towards the green transformation.

  The IBIA's decision to host this event in Hong Kong is absolutely spot on. As you all know, we're renowned for our highly efficient, professional and smart port services, consistently ranking us among the world's top international maritime centres. This is complemented by our thriving bunkering activities, which put us seventh in the world, second in our country and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We haven't said so in the past, but as we move on from conventional fuel to greener fuel for shipping vessels, we dig out our figures and records. It seems that it is not just that we have been doing good and ranking high in terms of cargo throughput, but we have also been making use of our pivotal position to provide fuel for ocean-going vessels over the decades. Therefore, it seems more than suitable to discuss the latest developments in bunkering in the busiest bunkering hub and the most happening port in the region. So I can assure you, Alexander, you have chosen the right place to host this forum since your visit last year.

  Our strength in bunkering is no coincidence: Hong Kong is strategically located at the southernmost tip of southern China right next to international fairways, making it a perfect place for ships to refuel. And now, as the entire marine community is pivoting to decarbonisation, a great opportunity lies right ahead of us. By leveraging this strategic position, Hong Kong is poised to develop into a leading centre for green maritime fuel bunkering as well as trading - ensuring we continue to meet the industry's evolving needs for top-notch, sustainable bunkering services. In fact, to support the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s vision of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government took action quickly, and we are determined to do so, notwithstanding the hiccups recently on the schedule of the IMO. Exactly one year ago, we laid out a clear pathway and roadmap for our port in the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering promulgated. 

  The thinking behind our Action Plan is very simple: we need to offer the industry a clear direction on green maritime fuel adoption, supported by policies that can turn our shared vision for a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre into reality. That's why we've set out in the Action Plan five main strategies - Green Fuel, Green Port, Green Incentives, Green Collaboration and Green Talents. We have 10 specific measures underpinning these five strategies.

  Starting with Green Fuels, we make clear that Hong Kong will adopt a multi-fuel strategy, with the most commonly used or explored fuels such as LNG (liqified natural gas), biodiesel, methanol, ammonia and hydrogen being the fuels of choice. We then set out to build up a supply chain of such fuels in Hong Kong, from locating sources of green fuels in the proximity, that is the Chinese Mainland, which is conveniently right next to us and have been the largest supplier of such fuels by far, to developing storage facilities and providing bunkering infrastructure in Hong Kong. We are small, but I think we will be targeted and focused in providing, putting and rolling out storage facilities, infrastructure support, so as to allow Hong Kong to provide a miniature of the ecosystem that is advocated under the IBIA. Crucially, this strategy is already backed by concrete regulatory actions. Just to name a few, we have passed the enabling legislation, published technical requirements and guidelines, and approved a duty exemption for methanol bunkering. In the old days, there used to be some industry using the methanol for making wine. And that is not good for health. That is why we have updated legislation on charging duty on methanol. It might have just looked like a simple piece of legislation; we went around the government administration, particularly the health authorities, the doctors and the medical practitioners. While we respect their professionalism, it took us some time to convince them that we are now looking for bunkering only, for our outward-looking ships and not winemaking. While we have already amended our law, we promised that we will input, inject some of the tightened safeguarding measures, from the customs point of view, to make sure that there will be no abuse of this tax exemption. But this is a right signal that we have expedited, and we hope to see the first-ever methanol bunkering operation soon in Hong Kong.

  These are the precise policy measures, and legislative and supporting measures that we promised. We are designed to make green maritime fuel bunkering a practical and competitive reality. One year on, we have indeed come a long way, with commercial LNG and biodiesel bunkering services now available in Hong Kong and nearly 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels bunkered to date in Hong Kong. Still a lot of our industry players are not aware that Hong Kong has been treated to that point. They think that we are still at the initiation stage, still at the drafting stage. But I need to publicise more and talk more that we are actually actionable. We put things into operation, and it's not just for pilots, but it was for commercial operation. The first methanol bunkering operation, as I just mentioned, will also happen before long, while we will start looking into ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and hope to tell the market where we stand on it soon.

  We fully recognise that the maritime industry is global by nature. I also mentioned and discussed at the ICS (International Chamber of Shipping) summit, we do not treat Hong Kong-based shipping companies as local companies. We treat them all along as global companies. We are globally based. We need to take their concerns and anxieties, arising from all the geopolitical circumstances, dear to our hearts. We have to listen, facilitate and help them to resolve and to take solutions. A truly green transition can't happen in isolation; it demands collaboration between ports available worldwide. First, we have been supporting our port operators in their effort to reduce carbon emissions and create a greener port. But just as importantly, we are looking outward, we are actively identifying ports with which to establish green shipping corridors. I would like to learn more from the IBIA, because from your base worldwide, I already know that there are a few existing green shipping corridors in operation, and there are a few being planned. I very much hope that Hong Kong will be able to participate in some of those, if not all. If Hong Kong can lead discussions on creating a new ones, perhaps in this part of the region, we can actively participate and contribute. For the very first step, we have also announced the signing of the first batch of partner ports. This paved our way to put Hong Kong in a more high-profile position, so that we can attract more sisters and brothers to build a greater alliance. This initiative will definitely drive us to upgrade our infrastructure and enhance green maritime fuel bunkering capabilities, with the ultimate goal of creating truly net-zero emission shipping lanes. We will have some exciting updates on this front next year, particularly on our move towards creating or joining the green shipping corridors. It is not just an upward or a high profile publicising move, but actually I would like to use this to drive inward, back home. The effort towards building a green port is very important to push our ship operators or container terminal operators to invest and expedite their action. The IBIA Secretariat will know that there needs to be a lot of participation and influence, especially on the operators because they have to really invest billions and trillions of money. They will need to know the long-term future and long-term bright spot on that. But in the meantime, they will definitely need to make some tough decisions right in the short term for investments. With Hong Kong putting our footprint on the worldwide green transformation path, I would like to use this as a triggering point to enable our operators and industry players to join, participate and act.

  Closer to home, we are forging partnerships with stakeholders from both Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland. I think one of the points that the IBIA comes to Hong Kong is that you would like to run Hong Kong as a platform and you can get more knowledge about what is happening in the Chinese Mainland. In particular, we have set up some platforms and communication channels to focus squarely on fuel supply and trading with the Chinese Mainland. A powerful example of this collaboration was this June, when we signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with four green maritime fuel suppliers and bunker operators. This took place at a groundbreaking event - the first ever Mainland-Hong Kong green energy business matchmaking event organised under the auspices of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government. It is actually motivated and rooted between the Ministry of Commerce and my bureau. We hosted that matchmaking event in a dual mode. It was hosted both in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. We witnessed the signing of the MOU online and in parallel mode, thanks to all the digital technological backup. With over 300 industry representatives participating, the event was a clear sign of our shared commitment to building a thriving ecosystem for maritime fuel bunkering and trading. But we didn't stop there, we established a communication platform that encompasses companies registered and doing business in Hong Kong from across the entire maritime fuel bunkering supply chain, with a view to facilitating business discussion and collecting views from the trade on ways to bolster our competitiveness in green maritime fuel bunkering and trading. We warmly welcome all interested Hong Kong companies to join the communication platform. For all those from abroad, we welcome you to have branches or headquarters in Hong Kong, and we also welcome them to join this communication platform which we will be announcing soon, so stay tuned. Together, we can firmly put Hong Kong on the map as a premier green maritime fuel bunkering hub in the region, as well as a green maritime fuel trading centre that acts as the gateway for export and trading of Mainland-produced green maritime fuels.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards green maritime fuels is an irreversible trend for the maritime industry and this is what we have mentioned. This isn't a choice or an option; it's an imperative. And Hong Kong is all in. To navigate this change, we need forums like this. The IBIA has the right decision to have this spot right in this year's Hong Kong Maritime Week. I am sure you have helped drive some of our 18 000-plus participants this year, which is a record high. Today is about preparing for that future. The conversations in this room will equip us with the crucial steps we need very much to take, together and ahead. My thank to the IBIA for bringing us all together today, I encourage all participants this morning to make best of this event, learn more about the opportunities here in Hong Kong and also worldwide in different countries, different ports. We are all very passionate, notwithstanding the International Maritime Organization's agenda, and we hope that we can explore how we, together, can be a part of that exciting green journey.

  I wish you all a very fruitful event and a pleasant stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."

Special traffic and transport arrangements for Hong Kong Streetathon 2025 this Sunday,2025-11-19 12:11,2025-11-19 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111800621.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) today (November 19) reminded members of the public that temporary special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented in phases at various locations on Hong Kong Island North and in Kowloon East and Tseung Kwan O from 1am this Sunday (November 23) to facilitate the holding of the Hong Kong Streetathon 2025.

 The full marathon race will start at the Island Eastern Corridor (IEC) near Hing Fat Street and route through major road sections, including the IEC, the Central-Wan Chai Bypass, and Lung Wo Road, then turn back and be routed through the Eastern Harbour Crossing and the Tseung Lam Highway, and then turn back again and be routed via Cha Kwo Ling Road, Kwun Tong Bypass, Hoi Bun Road and Kai Fuk Road to the finishing point at the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) near Yau Ma Tei Interchange.

 The race route of the half marathon race will be similar to that of the full marathon race, except that it will not be routed through the Central-Wan Chai Bypass, Lung Wo Road and the Tseung Lam Highway.

 The 10-kilometre race will start at the Tseung Lam Highway near Tong Yin Street and route through the Tseung Lam Highway, Cha Kwo Ling Road, Kwun Tong Bypass and Hoi Bun Road to the finishing point at Kwun Tong Promenade.

 Subject to the race arrangements and progress, the road sections along the race routes will be temporarily closed in phases from 1am on that day, until the reopening of roads at about 1pm. Motorists are advised to pay attention to the traffic signs erected at the scene and consider using alternative routes to their destinations.

 Due to the temporary road closures, the TD anticipates that traffic at various locations on Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon and the New Territories will be significantly more congested compared to normal Sundays, including:


Hong Kong Island: King's Road, Java Road, Shau Kei Wan Road, Causeway Road, Victoria Park Road, Yee Wo Street, Gloucester Road, Hennessy Road, Connaught Road Central, Harcourt Road, Queensway, the Aberdeen Tunnel (Wan Chai bound) and the vicinity of Central Ferry Pier areas;
Kowloon: Kwun Tong Road, Wai Yip Street, Prince Edward Road East and the vicinity of Kowloon Bay areas; and
New Territories: The Tseung Kwan O Tunnel (Kowloon bound).


 Motorists are advised to avoid driving to the above affected areas. In case of traffic congestion, motorists should exercise patience, drive with care, and follow the instructions of the Police on-site.

 In view of the temporary road closures, 56 bus routes (including 14 KMB routes, 22 Citybus routes and 20 Cross Harbour Bus routes) and 15 Green Minibus routes will be affected and subject to diversion, truncation or relocation of stops in phases until the reopening of the roads. During the road closure period, taxi stands (including taxi pick-up/drop-off points), public light bus stands, roadside parking spaces and private car parks on the affected roads will be suspended.

 To enable participants travelling to Causeway Bay for the full and half marathon races, which have the earliest starting times of 5.15am and 5.55am respectively, the first departures of all MTR rail lines (except the Airport Express and Disneyland Resort Line) will be suitably advanced on Sunday, with the first departures on the Tuen Ma Line and East Rail Line to be operated at 2.50am. In addition, one special bus route will also be operated to serve event participants travelling to Causeway Bay this Sunday.

 Members of the public should plan their journeys early to avoid unexpected delays and use public transport services (particularly railway services) as far as possible, paying attention to the arrangements of temporary route diversions and relocations of stops. They may browse the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk) or mobile application ""HKeMobility"" for information about special traffic and transport information, or they may also browse relevant public transport operators' websites or mobile applications for details of service changes.

 The TD and the Police will closely monitor the traffic situation. Other temporary road and traffic control measures, including adjusting the extent of road closures and altering or suspending public transport services, may be implemented by the Police at short notice depending on the actual traffic conditions. Members of the public are advised to stay alert to the latest traffic news."

有關個䅁涉及一個位於橫跨北區虎地坳丈量約份第52約地段其中十三個分段的違例搭建物，面積約6 000平方米。由於有關僭建物不會獲地政總署發出豁免證明書，亦並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向業主發出13張清拆令。該業主沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（十一月十九日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"
"Property owner fined over $800,000 for not complying with removal orders",2025-11-19 11:00,2025-11-19 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900219.htm,"âAn owner was convicted and fined $806,000 in total, of which $182,000 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts yesterday (November 18) for failing to comply with removal orders issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 6 000 square metres across 13 sections of a lot in D.D. 52, Fu Tei Au, North District. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the unauthorised building works (UBWs) and the UBWs were also carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), 13 removal orders were served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal orders, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (November 19), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

徐浩光博士說：「環保署持續完善廚餘回收網絡，並加強宣傳教育，推動更多市民參與廚餘回收。現時已有超過1 500個設於公共屋邨、私人屋苑等地點的家居廚餘回收設施。環保署去年更策略性地在全港各區逐步設立約250個公眾廚餘回收點，當中在夜間營運的『廚餘回收流動點』，更可為繁忙都市中的居民提供便捷的廚餘回收途徑。在最新推出的『廚餘回收車試驗計劃』下，回收車每晚走訪不同地點推廣廚餘回收，並讓市民認識和體驗廚餘回收。我們希望藉此便利市民，鼓勵更多市民實踐綠色生活。」

「廚餘回收車試驗計劃」上月率先在中西區試行，回收車每晚六時三十分至十時三十分，走訪區內四個指定地點，向市民推廣源頭分類及正確回收廚餘的方法，並為市民提供便利的廚餘回收途徑。四個服務地點包括：

1. 半山區麥當勞道（近聚安樓）：晚上六時三十分至七時十五分
2. 西營盤港鐵站C出口外停車處：晚上七時四十分至八時二十五分
3. 堅尼地城堅彌地城海旁（近明珠閣）：晚上八時四十五分至九時三十分
4. 堅尼地城堅彌地城新海旁（近嘉安大廈）：晚上九時四十五分至十時三十分

計及「廚餘回收車試驗計劃」，全港在夜間營運的「廚餘回收流動點」已達至104個（見附件），每日在晚間時分於貼近民居或食肆地點定時定點運作，方便附近居民及食肆在晚間處理廚餘，養成廚餘回收的習慣。

透過推行各種措施，廚餘回收量近年持續上升。整體廚餘回收量已達至每日340公噸，較二○二三年增長一倍，當中家居廚餘回收量由二○二三年每日七公噸大幅增至現時約130公噸。

徐浩光博士和鄭健向在場市民介紹「廚餘回收車試驗計劃」，聽取他們對環保署回收服務的意見，並向市民宣傳十二月七日舉行的立法會選舉。

徐浩光博士說：「我呼籲大家在十二月七日與家人一同履行公民責任，踴躍投票，選出愛國愛港的有能之士，為香港未來的發展作出貢獻。」"
DEP inspects operation of food waste recycling truck and calls on public to cast votes in Legislative Council General Election (with photos),2025-11-19 10:30,2025-11-19 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111800660.htm,"The Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, and the Deputy Director of Environment Protection (Waste Reduction), Mr Kenneth Cheng, inspected the operation of the Trial Scheme on Food Waste Recycling Truck (Trial Scheme) in Central and Western District on November 17 and promoted food waste recycling to the public. They took the opportunity to call on the public to cast their votes in the Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election on December 7.

Dr Chui said, ""The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has been continuously enhancing the food waste recycling network, and strengthening publicity and education to encourage more people to participate in food waste recycling. Currently, there are more than 1 500 food waste recycling facilities set up in premises including public rental housing estates and private residential estates. Since last year, the EPD has been strategically setting up around 250 public food waste recycling points across all districts. Among these, the Food Waste Recycling Spots that operate at night time provide busy citizens with convenient recycling outlets for food waste. Under the newly launched Trial Scheme, a recycling truck visits various locations every evening to promote food waste recycling, allowing members of the public to learn about and experience food waste recycling for themselves. We hope this make it convenient for people to practise green living.""

The Trial Scheme was rolled out first in Central and Western District last month. A food waste recycling truck operates from 6.30pm to 10.30pm every night, visiting four designated locations in the district to promote waste separation at source and proper ways of food waste recycling, and provide a convenient outlet for the public to recycle food waste. The four designated locations are:


MacDonnell Road, Mid-levels (near Silvercrest): 6.30pm to 7.15pm
Parking Area outside Exit C of Sai Ying Pun MTR Station: 7.40pm to 8.25pm
Praya Kennedy Town,Kennedy Town (near Brilliant Court): 8.45pm to 9.30pm
New Praya Kennedy Town,Kennedy Town (near Ka On Building): 9.45pm to 10.30pm


Including the Trial Scheme, the number of night-time Food Waste Recycling Spots has reached 104 (see annex). Operating at fixed times and locations during evening hours close to residential and dining areas, these recycling points facilitate nearby residents and eateries to dispose of food waste at night and develop recycling habits.

Through the implementation of various measures, the amount of food waste recycled has been on the rise in recent years. The overall food waste recycled has reached 340 tonnes per day, doubling the figure of 2023. In particular, the amount of domestic food waste recycled significantly increased from 7 tonnes per day in 2023 to about 130 tonnes per day currently.

Dr Chui and Mr Cheng introduced the Trial Scheme to the residents on-site and listened to their feedback on the EPD's recycling services. They also called on the public to support the LegCo General Election on December 7.

Dr Chui said, ""I urge everyone to exercise their civic responsibilities with their families by casting their votes on December 7. Let’s elect outstanding individuals with an affection for the country and Hong Kong to contribute to the future development of the city."""

HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission report,2025-11-19 04:32,2025-11-19 05:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/19/P2025111900087.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (November 19) strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects the groundless attacks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the situation of the HKSAR including safeguarding national security, protecting human rights and business environmentin the so-called ""2025 report"" issued by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC).

  The HKSAR Government spokesman stressed, ""The HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects USCC's wanton manoeuvre with politics prevailing over law-based administration and interference in the affairs of the HKSAR in the so-called report. The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, is a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under 'one country, two systems',and comes directly under the Central People's Government. The legal basis for implementing 'one country, two systems' comprises the Constitution and the Basic Law, which provide constitutional guarantee for fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to equality before the law, and is buttressed by the rule of law and independent judicial power.""

  ""The HKSAR steadfastly safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to this top priority of the 'one country, two systems' principle. The HKSAR Government will resolutely, fully and faithfully continue to implement the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL), the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) and other relevant laws so as to prevent, suppress and impose punishment on acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law. At the same time, it will safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people, ensuring the steadfast and successful implementation of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the US to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.""

Laws Safeguarding National Security

  The spokesman stressed, ""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. No country will watch with folded arms on acts and activities that endanger national security. In terms of legislation relating to safeguarding national security, the US has at least 21 pieces. There have also been countless administrative orders issued in the name of so-called 'national security'. However, the relevant commission exposed their double standards as they pointed fingers at the HKSAR's legal system and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, while totally disregarded the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate and continuously enhance relevant laws, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and the protection of human rights.""

  ""In fact, the implementation of the HKNSL in the past five years or so has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly resume to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. With the support from all sectors of the community, the SNSO was unanimously passed by the Legislative Council, and took effect upon gazettal on March 23, 2024, thereby further improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security. According to the Economic Freedom of the World 2025 Annual Report, Hong Kong has once again been ranked as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres and comes first in the world in terms of funds raised through initial public offerings in the first three quarters of 2025. Hong Kong ranks the 24th out of 142 countries and jurisdictions globally in the 2025 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index. Its overall score (0.72) remained unchanged, matching the scores of the countries ranked 22nd and 23rd. Hong Kong remains high in the overall ranking and continues to be ahead of some European and American countries, including the US, which often unreasonably criticise the rule of law and human rights situation of Hong Kong. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to the Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security.""

  ""As a matter of fact, the HKNSL and SNSO clearly define the elements of relevant offences, penalties, exceptions and defences. These laws actively prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities endangering national security, in accordance with the principle of the rule of law. They target an extremely small minority of individuals and organisations that pose a threat to national security, while protecting the lives and property of the general public and their legitimate rights and interests. Law-abiding persons will not unwittingly violate the law.""

  ""The HKSAR has the constitutional responsibility to continue to improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. The purpose of the subsidiary legislation made under the SNSO in May 2025 is to better carry into effect the provisions of the HKNSL concerning the mandate of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (OSNS). The subsidiary legislation does not grant the OSNS any new power, and will not affect the lives of ordinary citizens or the normal operation of institutions or organisations.""

  ""Extraterritorial effect for offences under the HKNSL and the SNSO fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Hong Kong Police Force are duty-bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security outside Hong Kong. Those absconders hiding outside Hong Kong are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security and wantonly collude with external forces to cover for their evil deeds. It is necessary for the HKSAR Government to take all lawful measures. The specification of absconders in respect of offences endangering national security and specification of measures applicable against the relevant absconders under the SNSO aim to address, combat, deter and prevent acts of abscondment, and procure the return of absconders to Hong Kong to face law enforcement and judicial proceedings. Such actions are fully justified, necessary and legitimate. In fact, quite a number of countries including the US would also impose such measures on wanted criminals. The US's abuse of long-arm jurisdiction and indiscriminate use of so-called sanctions are the real form of 'transnational repression'.""

  ""The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, paying no regard to their political stance, background or occupation of the person or organisation involved. The HKSAR Government has repeatedly emphasised that the suggestion that any persons or organisations with certain backgrounds should be immune from legal sanctions for their illegal acts and activities is tantamount to granting such persons privileges to break the law and is totally contrary to the spirit of the rule of law. External forces continue to distort the truth, blatantly discredit the judicial system and trials of the HKSAR, in an attempt to glorify criminal behavior and exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the Committee to respect fundamental principles such as the spirit of the rule of law and judicial independence, and to immediately cease these despicable actions.""

Safeguarding Due Administration of Justice and Rule of Law

  ""The HKSAR Government emphasised that all judicial cases are handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law. All defendants will receive fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong (including the HKNSL and the SNSO) and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The so-called report specifically mentioned cases on offences endangering national security involving Wong Chi-fung and Lai Chee-ying, wantonly smearing the law enforcement, prosecution and judicial organs of the HKSAR regarding the handling of the relevant cases. Their ulterior motives are obvious, namely, to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power in order to procure a defendant's evasion of the criminal justice process. The HKSAR Government strongly condemned these blatant attempting to undermine the rule of law of the HKSAR.""

  The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government safeguards independent judicial power and fully supports the Judiciary in exercising its judicial power independently, safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law. Articles 2, 19 and 85 of the Basic Law specifically provide that the HKSAR enjoys independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication, and the courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. The legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR will absolutely not undermine the independent judicial power. When handling cases involving offences endangering national security, judges, as in all other cases, perform their judicial duties independently and impartially, without any interference. The HKSAR Government supports the Judiciary to continue to seek suitable candidates, both locally and overseas, to serve as non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal, and to handle such judicial appointments in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. The presence or absence of individual non-permanent judges have no impact on the integrity of the judicial system. In fact, many non-permanent judges have expressed confidence in the independence of the judicial officers of the HKSAR when they left office.""

  ""The Department of Justice, by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law, controls criminal prosecutions, makes independent prosecutorial decisions in accordance with the law, free from any interference. Prosecutions would be instituted by the Department of Justice only if there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction, and if it is in the public interest to do so.""

  ""The Judiciary of the HKSAR exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing. All cases concerning offence endangering national security will be handled by the prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR in a fair and timely manner in strict compliance with Article 42(1) of the HKNSL, with the procedural rights of defendants exercised in accordance with the law fully respected throughout the process. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws, and cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or background of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.""

  ""The so-called 'report' threatened again to impose 'sanctions' on the HKSAR, attempting to use political power to deter relevant personnel in the HKSAR from discharging their responsibilities to safeguard national security, interfering in the law enforcement and judicial process of the HKSAR. All these are reprehensible acts undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR, which the HKSAR Government strongly condemns. All relevant personnel in the HKSAR will not be intimidated and will continue to resolutely discharge the responsibility of safeguarding national security.""

Anti-Money Laundering and Enforcement of Sanctions

  The HKSAR Government spokesman continued, ""It is high on the HKSAR Government's agenda to maintain the integrity and robustness of our financial systems. Our banks and other financial institutions strictly adhere to international standards and best practices, including those on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). Hong Kong has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setter on AML/CFT, to be overall compliant with the relevant international standards, with a robust legal framework and effective system, especially in the identification and understanding of risks, law enforcement, asset recovery and international co-operation.""

  The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government has been enforcing the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) fully and vigorously to fulfil our international obligations. We do not implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries that constitute a flagrant violation of the international order based on international law and the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The HKSARG has long been maintaining an effective mechanism for implementing the resolutions of the UNSC. That includes denying entry of vessels designated by the UNSC as well as suspicious vessels, keeping a close watch on and inspecting suspicious Hong Kong-based companies to prevent them from participating in activities evading UNSC sanctions, and participating in the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Arms Trade Treaty through the Central People's Government. The effectiveness of our work has been well respected and recognised by our trading partners.""

SafeguardingRights andFreedoms

  The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The HKNSL and the SNSO also clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc. Indeed, Article 19 of the ICCPR specifically requires that journalists must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities' including protection of national security or public order.""

  ""In fact, since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO, the media landscape in Hong Kong has remained vibrant. However, some people with ulterior motives deliberately fabricated facts about freedom of the press and speech in Hong Kong. Like all other places in the world, freedom of the press and speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, has an obligation to abide by all the laws. The media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise government policies without any restriction, as long as this is not in violation of the law. The court further cited precedents from the European Court of Human Rights regarding press freedom in the reasons for verdict of a relevant case, pointing out that the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of speech even with respect to press coverage on matters of serious public concern. The most crucial point is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.""

Maintaining long-term prosperity and stability

ããThe spokesmanreiterated, ""Under 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the distinctive advantageof enjoying strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world. With such unparalleled connectivity, Hong Kong will continue to play its dual role as ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"". Hong Kong will also continue to leverage its strengths to enhance its role as international financial, maritime and trade centres, among others, whilst proactively integrating into the overall development of our nation, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, etc.. The HKSAR Government will continue to identify new areas for economic development and proactively compete for enterprises and talents with a view to promoting the sustainable development and enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong. As a matter of fact, Hong Kong has once again been ranked as the world’s freest economy by the Fraser Institute. On the other hand, the US enjoys significant economic benefits in Hong Kong and has realised a trade surplus of more than US$270 billion with Hong Kong over the past 10 years, the largest among US global trading partners. There are about 1 390 US companies with their businesses in Hong Kong. All these demonstrate the close and long-standing economic ties between Hong Kong and the US, as well as the vast business interests of the US in Hong Kong. A stable and prosperous Hong Kong is certainly of mutual benefits to Hong Kong and the US."""
