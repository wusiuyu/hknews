立法會七題：防止僱員工作過勞,2025-10-22 11:24,2025-10-22 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200243.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上林振昇議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

關於防止僱員工作過勞，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見指出，目前政府沒有就「工作過勞」制訂定義，若有僱員懷疑因工作過勞而猝死，往往被歸類為「在工作期間非因意外或職業病死亡」情況，過去十年每年及本年至今，勞工處錄得該情況的個案數目為何，並按死者（a）性別、（b）年齡、（c）所屬行業、（d）職業、（e）去世前六個月獲連續受聘期間（即連續兩個月或以上）的平均每月最高工時（以（i）256小時以下、（ii）256至279小時、（iii）280至299小時、（iv）300至319小時、（v）320至339小時及（vi）340小時或以上劃分）、（f）去世前一個月的總工時（以（i）276小時或以下、（ii）277至299小時、（iii）300至319小時、（iv）320至339小時及（v）340小時或上劃分），以及（g）死因（例如心臟疾病和腦疾病）列出分項數字及其所佔百分比；

（二）就第（一）項所述的個案，當局曾協助或跟進多少宗已故僱員家屬向有關僱主提出的申索個案；至今已完成處理的個案數目為何，並按申索情況（包括已故僱員家屬（i）放棄追討、（ii）已與僱主達成和解協議及（iii）已入稟法院向僱主提出申索）列出分項數字及有關百分比；該等申索涉及的平均款額，以及獲判勝訴及敗訴的宗數分別為何；獲判勝訴個案裁定的平均補償款額為何；

（三）鑑於政府於二○一六年十一月三十日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，根據《職業安全及健康條例》（第509章），僱主必須在合理及可行範圍內，確保僱員的工作安全及健康，包括確保其僱員得到適當的休息，當局根據甚麼準則判斷僱員是否得到適當休息；有否發現第（一）項所述個案涉及的僱主違反第509章的相關規定；如有，詳情為何，包括提出檢控及被定罪個案數目，以及被定罪個案的平均判罰；

（四）鑑於有研究顯示，保安員和建造業員工在工作期間因心腦血管病死亡的個案甚多，勞工處與職業安全健康局遂於二○二二年開展為期三年的「護心計劃」，為建造業和物業管理業機構的員工提供到會式健康風險評估等服務，讓該等行業前線員工及早認識心腦血管病的相關風險，該計劃的參與機構及受惠工友數目為何，並按行業（即建造業和物業管理業）列出分項數字；

（五）鑑於政府於二○一八年時決定會透過勞工處的行業性三方小組為11個行業編製行業性工時指引，以列明建議的工時安排及超時工作補償安排供僱主參考及採用，有關制訂指引工作的最新進展為何；及

（六）會否考慮參考鄰近地區的做法，為工作過勞制訂定義，並規定若有僱員在符合該定義的情況下受傷或死亡，其僱主須履行相關法定補償責任，以為工友或其家屬提供更大保障；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就林振昇議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）在過去十年，勞工處每年接獲涉及僱員在工作期間非因意外或職業病死亡的個案介乎98宗至182宗。根據勞工處有關職業傷亡致命個案的統計資料，於工作期間因心臟及腦血管疾病（心腦血管病）病發而死亡的個案，佔工作間非因意外死亡個案的絕大多數。有關個案按性別、年齡、所屬行業、職業／工作性質及死因劃分的分項數字及其所佔百分比詳列於附件一。勞工處沒有備存有關個案去世前一個月的總工時或去世前連續兩個月或以上內平均每月最高工時。

（二）就第（一）項所述的1 439宗個案，截至二○二五年九月，勞工處已完成處理1 397宗個案，正跟進餘下的42宗個案。已完成處理的個案每宗平均申索款額約為$890,000，其中經勞工處處理後獲僱主賠償的個案有五宗，家屬沒有繼續追討或家屬與僱主直接達成和解協議等的個案有1 374宗，其餘18宗個案的家屬已入稟法院向僱主提出申索。就家屬已入稟法院提出申索的個案，勞工處得悉法院已審結17宗，皆為在法院達成和解協議。

（三）根據《職業安全及健康條例》（《條例》）第6條的一般責任條款，僱主須在合理地切實可行範圍內，確保其僱員在工作中的安全及健康，包括為他們提供或維持屬安全和不會危害健康的工作系統，而休息時段是讓僱員恢復精神及體力的重要一環。勞工處人員根據《條例》巡查不同的工作地點時，會考慮個別工作地點的環境、工作性質及僱員的個人因素等情況，評估僱主有否提供或維持屬安全和不會危害健康的工作系統，而非只單獨考慮休息安排。若巡查發現有不足之處，視乎情況的嚴重性和所得證據，會按法例作出相應的執法行動。勞工處沒有備存與休息安排相關的檢控數字。

另外，勞工處已發出《休息時段指引》，鼓勵不同行業的持份者因應其行業情況，以風險為本及共同協商的原則，制定合理可行及勞資雙方同意的休息時段和安排。

（四）勞工處自二○二二年起聯同職業安全健康局推行「護心計劃」，鼓勵物業管理業和建造業的僱員建立健康生活習慣，預防心腦血管疾病。截至二○二五年九月三十日，共有1 991機構（包括522建造業機構及1 469物業管理機構）參加「護心計劃」並簽署「護心約章」，涵蓋僱員人數超過34萬，當中包括近10萬建造業僱員及超過24萬物業管理業僱員。

（五）勞工處致力在各行業性三方小組與僱主組織及勞工團體等商議擬定行業性工時指引。與會者坦誠分享各行業的工時安排及相關措施，但就擬定工時指引的方向及內容，包括應否及如何擬定每周或每天的標準工時，以及超時工作的工資補償比率等，勞資雙方仍未能達成共識。勞工處會參考三方小組的討論，加強宣傳及推廣良好工時管理措施，鼓勵僱主與僱員擬定合適的工時安排，促進僱員的工作與生活平衡。三方小組亦會繼續討論與工時有關的議題。

（六）「工作過勞」並非一個醫學診斷。根據勞工處所掌握的資料，國際勞工組織並沒有就「工作過勞」而導致工作間死亡制訂定義或指引，國際上亦缺乏公認的準則；而絕大部分國家或地方並沒有循僱員補償角度制訂相關定義。

香港現行的《僱員補償條例》已訂明，即使僱員所患疾病並非指明的職業病，但經證明是僱員在受僱工作期間因工遭遇意外所致的身體受傷或死亡，僱員或其家屬仍可根據條例就有關疾病向僱主追討補償。"
LCQ7: Prevention of employee overexertion at work,2025-10-22 11:24,2025-10-22 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200245.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Lam Chun-sing and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

 Regarding the prevention of employee overexertion at work, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views pointing out that at present, the Government has not drawn up any definition for ""overexertion at work"", and when an employee is suspected to have died suddenly due to overexertion at work, such cases are often classified as ""fatalities at work not caused by accidents or occupational diseases"", of the number of such cases recorded by the Labour Department (LD) in each of the past 10 ‍years and this year to date, with a breakdown by the deceased's (a) sex, (b) age, (c) industry, (d) occupation, (e) average maximum working hours per month during any period of continuous employment (i.e. two or more consecutive months) in the six months prior to death (set out by (i) less than 256 hours, (ii) 256 to 279 hours, (iii) 280 to 299 hours, (iv) 300 to 319 hours, (v) 320 to 339 hours and (vi) 340 hours or more), (f) total working hours in the month prior to death (set out by (i) 276 hours or less, (ii) 277 to 299 hours, (iii) ‍300 ‍to 319 hours, (iv) 320 to 339 hours and (v) 340 hours or more), and (g) cause of death (e.g. heart disease and brain disease), together with their respective percentages;

(2) in respect of the cases mentioned in (1), of the number of those in which the authorities have provided assistance to or conducted follow-up actions for claims lodged by the families of deceased employees against the relevant employers; the up-to-date number of cases in which the handling has been completed, with a breakdown by claim status (including deceased employees' families who have (i) withdrawn their claims for compensation, (ii) reached settlement agreements with the employers, and (iii) filed their claims in court against the employers), together with their respective percentages; the average amount of compensation involved in these claims and the respective numbers of successful and unsuccessful claims; the average amount of compensation awarded in successful cases;

(3) given that in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on November 30, 2016, the Government indicated that under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (Cap. 509), employers must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure the safety and health at work of their employees, which includes ensuring that their employees are given appropriate rest breaks, of the criteria on which the authorities base their determination as to whether an employee has been given appropriate rest breaks; whether any of the employers involved in the cases mentioned in (1) have been found to have contravened the relevant requirements under Cap. 509; if so, of the details, including the number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted and the number of convicted cases, and the average penalties imposed in convicted cases;

(4) given that some studies have shown a high incidence of fatalities during work relating to cerebro-cardiovascular diseases among security guards and construction workers, the Labour Department and the Occupational Safety and Health Council launched a three-year Heart Caring Campaign in June 2022 to provide on-site health risk assessments and related services to employees in the construction and property management industries, so as to enable frontline workers in these industries to identify risks associated with cerebro-cardiovascular diseases at an early stage, of the numbers of participating organisations and beneficiary workers under the Campaign, with a breakdown by industry (i.e. construction and property management industries);

(5) given that in 2018, the Government decided to draw up sector-specific working hours guidelines for 11 sectors through the industry-based tripartite committees of the LD, setting out suggested working hours arrangements and overtime compensation arrangements for employers' reference and adoption, of the latest progress in the development of these guidelines; and

(6) whether it will consider, with reference to the practices of neighbouring regions, drawing up a definition for overexertion at work and requiring employers to fulfil relevant statutory compensation obligations where an employee is injured or dies under circumstances falling within such definition, so as to provide greater protection for workers or their family members; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The reply to the Hon Lam Chun-sing's question is as follows:

(1) Over the past 10 years, the number of cases of fatalities at work received by the Labour Department (LD) each year that were not caused by work accidents or occupational diseases ranged from 98 to 182. According to the LD's statistics on occupational fatalities, cases died of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs) during work accounted for the vast majority of fatalities at work which are not caused by accidents. A breakdown of these cases by sex, age, industry, occupation or work nature, and cause of death, together with their respective percentages is provided in Annex I. The LD does not keep statistics of such cases by the total working hours of the cases in the month prior to their death, or the average maximum monthly working hours for two or more consecutive months prior to their death.

(2) As at September 2025, the LD had concluded the processing of 1397 cases of the 1439 cases mentioned in Part (1) and was following up on the remaining 42 cases. The average claim amount of each concluded case was around $890,000. Among the concluded cases, five received compensation from employers after LD's processing, and 1374 cases were not pursued by family members (FMs) or FMs had reached direct settlements with the employers, etc. FMs of the remaining 18 cases had lodged their claims at court. Among these 18 cases, the LD noted that 17 cases had been concluded, all with settlements reached at court.

(3) According to the general duty provisions under section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (OSHO), every employer must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure the safety and health at work of all his/her employees. This includes providing or maintaining systems of work that are safe and without risks to health, and rest breaks are essential for restoring employees' mental and physical strength. When conducting inspections at various workplaces in accordance with the OSHO, LD officers will assess whether the employer has provided or maintained a system of work which is safe and without risks to health by considering the environment of the individual workplace, the nature of the work, and the employees' personal factors, etc, rather than just considering rest arrangement alone. If deficiencies are found during the inspections, corresponding enforcement actions will be taken according to the law, depending on the seriousness of the case and the evidence collected. The LD does not keep prosecution figures related to rest arrangements.

 In addition, the LD has issued the Guide on Rest Breaks to encourage stakeholders of different industries, through a risk-based and consultative approach and having regard to their own circumstances, to work out reasonable and practicable rest break arrangements that are mutually agreed by employees and employers.

(4) Since 2022, the LD and the Occupational Safety and Health Council have jointly launched the Heart Caring Campaign to encourage employees in the property management and construction industries to develop healthy lifestyle to prevent CCVDs. As at September 30, 2025, 1 991 organisations (including 522 organisations in the construction industry and 1 469 organisations in the property management industry) have participated in the Campaign and signed the Heart Caring Charter, covering more than 340 000 employees, including nearly 100 000 employees in the construction industry and more than 240 000 employees in the property management industry.

(5) The LD has endeavoured to discuss with employer associations, labour organisations, etc, the formulation of sector-specific working hours guidelines through industry-based tripartite committees. While the participants candidly shared working hours arrangements and related measures in various sectors, the employers and employees have yet to reach a consensus on the direction and content of the proposed guidelines, including whether and how to establish weekly or daily working hours standards as well as the rates of compensation for overtime work. The LD will make reference to the discussions of tripartite committees to enhance the publicity and promotion of good working hours management practices, encourage employers and employees to formulate appropriate working hours arrangements thereby fostering employees' work-life balance. The tripartite committees will continue deliberating on issues relevant working hours.

(6) ""Overexertion at work"" is not a medical diagnosis. According to the information available to the LD, the International Labour Organization has not drawn up any definition or guidelines on workplace deaths caused by ""overexertion at work"", and there is also lack of internationally recognised criteria. Most countries or places do not have related definitions made in the context of employees' compensation.

 The existing Employees' Compensation Ordinance (ECO) of Hong Kong has stipulated that even if the disease suffered by an employee is not a specified occupational disease, the employee or his/her FMs may still claim compensation from the employer in respect of the disease in accordance with the ECO if the disease is substantiated to be a personal injury or death by accident arising out of and in the course of employment."
立法會十三題：提升旅客的通關體驗,2025-10-22 11:00,2025-10-22 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200252.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上陳克勤議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉內地與香港一直致力提升旅客的通關體驗。然而，有市民反映，由於跨境人流眾多，部分陸路口岸在臨近關閉時仍有不少旅客排隊等候辦理過關手續。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有市民反映，在深宵時分大部分陸路口岸關閉後，24小時開放的落馬洲管制站經常出現大量旅客人流，當局有否考慮延長其他陸路口岸的運作時間；若有，調整各口岸運作時間的詳細計劃為何；若否，原因為何；

（二）現時各陸路口岸有否設立酌情延長通關時間機制，以應對口岸關閉前仍有大量旅客等候過關的情況；若有，過去三年啓動相關機制的次數為何；若否，原因為何，以及會否與內地商討相關應對機制；

（三）有否與內地部門制訂通報機制，以在口岸關閉前的一段時間（例如半小時），互相通報正辦理離境手續的旅客人數，以確保有足夠時間為該等旅客辦理入境手續；若有，過去三年啓動相關機制的次數為何；若否，原因為何，以及會否與內地商討設立有關機制；

（四）過去三年，（i）經內地陸路口岸離境抵港的旅客，因本港關口已關閉而須向入境事務處求助的個案數目，以及（ii）經本港各陸路管制站離境的旅客，因內地關口已關閉而須即時折返回港的個案數目分別為何；及

（五）過去三年，本港各陸路管制站在關閉前一小時的平均出入境人次，以及辦理出入境手續（包括使用自助出入境檢查系統（e-道）服務）的平均等候時間分別為何；上述時段的通關平均等候時間與其他時段有否出現顯著差距；若有，會否考慮根據有關數據與內地當局商討或研究延長通關時間？

答覆：

主席：

隨着粵港市民跨境往來越趨頻繁，民間交流亦越見緊密。面對持續增長的通關需求，香港特別行政區政府一直密切監察各邊境管制站的運作，並積極提升口岸通關能力，便利香港與內地居民雙向奔赴。

就陳克勤議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）陸路口岸的開放時間由深港兩地政府協商，並須獲得中央批准。

目前，落馬洲／皇崗口岸為深港之間唯一24小時提供旅檢服務的口岸。根據入境事務處（入境處）的數據，現時落馬洲／皇崗口岸的服務能夠應付旅客於深夜時段過關的需求，並達致入境處的服務承諾，即98%的香港居民能夠在15分鐘內辦妥出入境手續，及95%的訪客能夠在30分鐘內辦妥出入境手續。

兩地政府亦會因應節日的通關需求，協商特別通關安排，便利兩地人民往來。例如，於去年除夕夜把羅湖口岸的旅客清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉延長至翌日凌晨二時，以及把深圳灣口岸的旅客和客車清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉，改為通宵服務。

此外，因應節日或大型活動期間增加的跨境人流，口岸部門會預先評估跨境旅客流量並作出相應安排，包括於繁忙時間安排其他組別的人員到管制站工作以加強服務。運輸署會提前與港鐵、本地和跨境公共交通營辦商協調，按預測人流加密班次。口岸部門亦會與內地相關部門，透過已建立的各個陸路口岸熱線及即時通報機制緊密聯繫，於有需要時作出迅速應變，靈活調配管制站人手加開檢查櫃枱、通道及小車車道，並按實際需要將部分貨車車道用作小車車道，確保口岸運作暢順。

延長通關時間牽涉兩地口岸運作，須審慎考慮一籃子因素，包括實際需要、兩地資源的有效運用、人手安排及交通配套等。在現行落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋香港口岸提供24小時旅客出入境清關服務基礎上，我們會繼續密切留意旅客通關需求，視乎實際需要適時與內地有關當局協商延長個別口岸的旅檢通關服務時間。

（二）至（四）深港兩地口岸部門就各個陸路口岸均已設立了即時通報機制，緊密聯絡，時刻監察陸路口岸的情況，確保通關及人流管理等工作暢順。

如上文所述，陸路口岸的開放時間須獲得中央批准。於兩地陸路管制站接近關閉時間，如仍有大量旅客排隊等候過關，兩地口岸部門會緊密對接，即時交換資訊，包括在管制站已完成辦理離境手續的旅客人數。入境處會彈性處理，在有需要時加開檢查櫃枱及通道，確保在管制站關閉前，為所有已在內地口岸完成辦理離境手續的旅客辦理入境手續，因而不會出現旅客在內地口岸完成離境手續後，因港方口岸已經關閉而未能辦理入境手續的情況。據我們了解，內地口岸部門的處理方式亦類同。

（五）一般而言，晚間時段並非陸路管制站的出入境高峰時段。然而，我們亦留意到，有不少旅客選擇在部分陸路管制站接近關閉前過關。如上文所述，口岸部門會靈活調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱及通道，確保在管制站關閉前，為所有已在內地口岸完成辦理離境手續的旅客辦理入境手續。

過去三年，入境處陸路邊境管制站皆達到入境處所定目標，即98%的香港居民能夠在15分鐘內辦妥出入境手續，及95%的訪客能夠在30分鐘內辦妥出入境手續。

口岸部門會繼續採取各項措施，包括靈活調配人手、優化工作流程、善用資訊科技等，提升口岸通關效率和便利化水平，應對不斷上升的通關需求。"

LCQ13: Enhancing boundary-crossing experience for travellers,2025-10-22 11:00,2025-10-22 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200255.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hak-kan and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (Oct 22):

Question:

  It is learnt that the Mainland and Hong Kong have all along endeavoured to enhance the boundary-crossing experience for travellers. However, some members of the public have relayed that, due to the high volume of passengers crossing the border, quite a number of travellers still have to queue up to go through immigration clearance at some land boundary control points (BCPs) just before they close. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the public have relayed that the Lok Ma Chau Control Point, which is open 24 hours a day, often experiences heavy passenger flow after most land BCPs close late at night, whether the authorities have considered extending the operating hours of other land BCPs; if so, of the detailed plan for adjusting the operating hours of various land BCPs; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether there is currently any mechanism in place at various land BCPs for exercising discretion to extend the operating hours in order to cope with situations where a large number of travellers are waiting to cross the border before the BCPs close; if so, how many times has the relevant mechanism been activated in the past three years; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will discuss with the Mainland the relevant mechanism to address the situation;

(3) whether a notification mechanism had been formulated with the Mainland authorities to mutually notify each other of the number of travellers going through departure clearance at certain time periods (e.g. every half an hour) before the BCPs close to ensure that there is sufficient time for travellers for immigration clearance; if so, how many times has the relevant mechanism been activated in the past three years; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will discuss setting up of such a mechanism with the Mainland;

(4) in the past three years, of (i) the number of cases in which inbound travellers arriving in Hong Kong via land BCPs in the Mainland had to seek assistance from the Immigration Department because the BCPs in Hong Kong were closed, and (ii) the number of cases in which outbound travellers via various land BCPs in Hong Kong had to turn back immediately because the BCPs in the Mainland were closed; and

(5) in the past three years, of the respective numbers of outbound and inbound passengers at various land BCPs in Hong Kong during the hour before their closure, as well as the average waiting time for immigration clearance (including the use of the automated clearance system (e-Channel) service); whether there is any significant difference in the average waiting time for immigration clearance between the aforementioned period and other periods; if so, whether it will, on the basis of the relevant data, consider discussing or studying with the Mainland authorities the extension of the clearance time?

Reply:

President,

  With the increasing cross-boundary passenger flows between Guangdong and Hong Kong, exchanges at the community level have also intensified. In view of the growing demand for clearance services, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been closely monitoring the operation of the boundary control points (BCPs) and proactively enhancing the clearance capacity to facilitate the two-way flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hak-kan is as follows:

(1) The opening hours of land BCPs are determined through consultation between the HKSAR Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government, and are subject to the approval of the Central Authorities.

  At present, Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port is the only BCP between Shenzhen and Hong Kong providing round-the-clock passenger clearance services. According to the statistics of the Immigration Department (ImmD), the current service capacity of LMC/HG Port is able to meet the demand for cross-boundary travels during late-night hours, fulfilling the ImmD's performance pledge to clear 98 per cent of Hong Kong residents within a 15-minute waiting time and 95 per cent of visitors within a 30-minute waiting time.

  The governments of both sides would also make special arrangements to meet the demand for clearance services and facilitate cross-boundary passenger flows during festive periods. For instance, on New Year's Eve last year, the passenger clearance services at the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually close at midnight, were extended until 2am the following day, while the passenger and passenger vehicle clearance services at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point, which usually close at midnight, operated overnight.

  In addition, to cope with the increase in crossâboundary passenger flows during festive periods or largeâscale events, the departments at BCPs will pre-assess the cross-boundary passenger traffic and make corresponding arrangements, including arranging officers of other sections to work at BCPs during peak hours to enhance services. The Transport Department will also co-ordinate in advance with the MTR Corporation Limited, as well as local and cross-boundary public transport operators, to increase service frequency based on the estimated passenger traffic. Besides, the departments at BCPs have been maintaining close liaison with relevant Mainland authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanisms for various land BCPs to take timely actions where necessary, including flexibly deploying manpower to operate additional clearance counters, channels and private car kiosks, and converting some of the goods vehicle kiosks into private car kiosks having regard to actual needs, to ensure smooth operations of BCPs.

  The extension of operating hours of clearance services involves the operation of the ports on both the Mainland and Hong Kong sides, and careful consideration has to be given to a host of factors, including the actual needs, effective utilisation of resources of both places, manpower arrangements and ancillary transport services. On the basis of the 24-hour passenger clearance services currently provided at the LMC/HG Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port, we will continue to closely monitor the demand for passenger clearance services and, having regard to actual needs, liaise with relevant Mainland authorities on extending the operating hours of the passenger clearance services at respective BCPs when necessary.

(2) to (4) Relevant departments of Hong Kong and the Mainland at BCPs would maintain close liaison through the established real-time notification mechanisms to monitor the real-time situations at land BCPs and ensure smooth clearance and crowd management.

  As aforementioned, the opening hours of land BCPs are subject to the approval of the Central Authorities. In cases where BCPs of both places are nearing closing time and there are still a large number of passengers queuing up for clearance, relevant departments of both places will liaise closely and immediately exchange information, including the number of passengers who have completed departure clearance at BCPs. The ImmD would exercise flexibility and operate extra clearance counters and channels when necessary, with a view to ensuring the completion of arrival clearance for all inbound passengers who have completed departure clearance at the Mainland ports before the closure of BCPs. There will hence not be any instances where passengers, having completed departure clearance at the Mainland ports, are unable to complete arrival clearance due to the closure of BCPs in Hong Kong. We understand that the Mainland port authorities adopt a similar arrangement.

(5) Generally speaking, evening hours are not peak periods for boundary crossings at BCPs. However, it is observed that quite some passengers choose to cross the boundary shortly before the closing time of BCPs. As aforementioned, the departments at BCPs will flexibly deploy manpower and operate extra clearance counters and channels to ensure the completion of arrival clearance for all passengers who have completed departure clearance at the Mainland ports before the closure of BCPs.

  In the past three years, all land BCPs under the ImmD have met the ImmD's target to clear 98 per cent of Hong Kong residents within a 15-minute waiting time and 95 per cent of visitors within a 30-minute waiting time.

  The departments at BCPs will continue to take various measures, including flexible deployment of manpower, optimisation of workflow and effective use of information technology, so as to enhance the clearance efficiency and the level of clearance facilitation at BCPs to cope with the increasing demand for clearance services."

CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as severe paediatric influenza infection case was recorded over two consecutive days,2025-10-21 21:14,2025-10-21 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100859.htm,"Following yesterday's (October 20) announcement ofa case of severe paediatric influenza A infection, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 21) recorded another severe case.The CHP reiterated its appeal to schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 2-year-old girl with underlyingillness. She has developed a fever, cough and shortness of breathsince October 10. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospitalon October 16 and was admitted for treatment. She is currently in critical condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza A(H1)virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia.

The girl had not received the 2025/26 SIV yet. Her household contacts are currently asymptomatic and no influenza outbreaks have been reported at her school recently.

  ""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illnessoutbreaks in schools since September. As of October 21, 587 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 62 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 315 cases in primary schools and 210 cases in secondary schools. Including the above case, 12 severe paediatric influenza cases, including one fatal case, involving children aged 2 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year. Nine of them had good past health,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

  ""Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to the Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions,"" he added.

The 2025/26 SIV Programmes have commenced, offering free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. This year, all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools are allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities.

The Government has opened all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission in the 18 districts, and 74 Family Medicine Clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system.

Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

連續兩日錄得兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-10-21 20:30,2025-10-21 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100828.htm,"繼昨日（十月二十日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月二十一日）再接獲另一宗嚴重個案。中心再次呼籲學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的兩歲女童。她十月十日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和氣促，十月十六日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，需留院治理，目前情況危殆。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感（H1）呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發嚴重肺炎。

女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，她就讀的學校近日亦沒有出現流感爆發的情況。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港正值夏季流感季節，學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案自九月起大幅上升。截至十月二十一日，九月開學後涉及學校的爆發個案共有587宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（62宗）、小學（315宗）及中學（210宗）。計及上述個案，中心由開學至今錄得十二宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎2至17歲，其中九人過往的健康狀況良好。」

他續說：「市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃已經展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。今年所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。

此外，政府亦已開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下18區的地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間家庭醫學診所和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生提醒高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

It is in this spirit of reverence, and continuity, that we remember and honour a monumental figure for the Shaw Prize, the scientific community and, indeed, humanity – Professor Chen-ning Yang.

  A founding member of the Shaw Prize Council and the Chair of its Board of Adjudicators for over a decade, Professor Yang was instrumental in establishing the very standards of excellence we recognise today. As one of the first Chinese scientists to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics, he reshaped modern physics, and remained devoted to the scientific and educational developments of China, our country.

  Professor Yang's spirit of intellectual pursuit, and his unwavering dedication to advancing knowledge for humanity, continue to live on today.

  This commitment to excellence brings us here tonight – some 600 strong from around the world – to honour this year's Shaw Laureates. Here to pay tribute to their pioneering advances in three discrete disciplines: astronomy, life science and medicine, and mathematical sciences.

  My congratulations to each of you for your outstanding, and continuing, contributions to science and to civilisation – to a future bright with co-operation, progress and purpose.

  That, of course, speaks of the vision Sir Run Run Shaw brought to compelling life – with the help of Professor Yang and other founding members – one that celebrates education and the pursuit of knowledge through science and research.

  That vision is central to the priorities and policies of the HKSAR Government. We dedicate significant investments to innovation and technology, and the research and development that drives it.

  That same commitment shapes our post-secondary education. I'm proud to say that Hong Kong is home to five of the world's top 100 universities. And, in the 2026 World University Rankings, announced earlier this month, Hong Kong claimed a record six spots in the top 200.

  Indeed, this year, for the first time, all eight of our publicly funded universities made the World University Rankings.

  And in this year's World Talent Ranking, Hong Kong finished fourth overall, topping the world in the category of ""graduates in sciences"".

  Hong Kong's outstanding institutions nurture our talented and hard-working young generation. They also help to attract some of the world's best academics and professionals to our city. Just this month, we welcomed a Nobel Laureate in Physics to one of our universities. We are thankful to many science laureates, as well as world-class academics and researchers in our city, and I'm confident that they will continue to propel Hong Kong's rise as an international education and I&T hub.

  The Hong Kong Government will continue to work closely with the Shaw Prize, our homegrown scientific award of international repute, in realising the potential of science, and in contributing to a world that prizes collaboration, harmony and a future of promise and innovation for all.

  My congratulations to all laureates again. I wish you a memorable evening in Hong Kong – Asia's world city. Asia's science city.

  Thank you."

Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency leads industry delegation to shine at 19th Hangzhou Cultural & Creative Industry Expo (with photos),2025-10-21 19:50,2025-10-21 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100539.htm,"The Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) under the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau led industry members to participate in the 19th Hangzhou Cultural & Creative Industry Expo (HCIE) which started October 17 and concluded yesterday (October 20). A Hong Kong Pavilion themed ""Hong Kong is So Chic"" was set up, which showcased an array of exquisite design works and creative lifestyle representations. Through hosting a series of activities, it also enhanced the industry's exposure on the Chinese Mainland, fostering opportunities for market expansion and collaboration. The Hong Kong Pavilion was well received by visitors, with over 50 000 attendees recorded during the four-day expo period, reflecting the appeal of Hong Kong's cultural and creative forces.

  The design of the Hong Kong Pavilion focused on Hong Kong's vibrant cityscape, charaterised by the organised chaos from the city's narrow lanes and alleys, imparting an ambience of serenity. It showcased works from renowned Hong Kong brands and creators alongside creations from emerging designers and brands. Their designs represented the East-meets-West cultural fusion of Hong Kong, highlighting the diversity and unique charm of the city's cultural contours.

The Hong Kong Pavilion comprised the Art Toy Zone, the Fashion and Apparel Zone, the Hong Kong Brands Zone, and the Film and Comics Zone, exhibiting films, comics, art toys, fashion, jewellery, and lifestyle products from 13 local designers and brands, with an aim of showcasing the latest achievements in Hong Kong's cultural and creative industries. The Hong Kong Pavilion also hosted a variety of engaging activities during the expo, including music and dance performances, demonstrations of filigree craft and Hong Kong-style tea pulling, sharing and autograph sessions, all showcasing the soft power of Hong Kong's pop culture.

Following the enthusiastic response received by the Hong Kong Pavilion at the 21st China (Shenzhen) International Cultural Industries Fair in May this year, the HCIE once again provided a platform for Hong Kong's cultural and creative power to shine. As pledged in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", CCIDA proactively assists Hong Kong cultural and creative designers in producing more cultural and creative products with Chinese and Hong Kong cultural features, and will continue to strengthen support for local original works to enter the Mainland and international markets."
10 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operation (with photos) ,2025-10-21 19:01,2025-10-21 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100747.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted an anti-illegal worker operation at a newly built/inhabited housing estate at Tung Chung District codenamed ""Contribute"" for two consecutive days on October 20 and today (October 21) to combat the influx of illegal renovation workers.

  ImmD investigators recently noticed that some Mainland renovation companies were using online social media platforms to offer one-stop renovation services at a lower price. Meanwhile, some offenders might attempt to reduce their service costs and gain profit from hiring illegal workers to conduct renovation works in Hong Kong.

  ImmD immediately conducted an operation at a newly built/inhabited housing estate. Immigration officers raided over 150 target locations. A total of seven suspected illegal workers and three suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised seven men, aged 36 to 54. Two men and a woman, aged 43 to 54, suspected of employing the illegal workers, were also arrested. Investigations into the suspected employers are ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  At the same time, ImmD officers and a promotional vehicle have been deployed to distribute ""Don't Employ Illegal Workers"" leaflets and convey the message to occupants and property management staff in housing estates.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email toanti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form atwww.immd.gov.hk."
反非法勞工行動拘十人（附圖）,2025-10-21 19:01,2025-10-21 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100745.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月二十日至今日（十月二十一日）一連兩日在東涌區一個新入伙的大型屋苑展開代號為「促進行動」的反非法勞工行動，以打擊從事裝修工作的非法勞工。

入境處調查人員較早前留意到有內地裝修公司透過網上社交平台，以相對便宜的價錢作招倈，提供一站式的裝修工程服務。同時，有不法分子會聘請非法勞工來港進行裝修工作，以減低服務成本，從中獲利。

入境處隨即針對新入伙的大型屋苑展開行動，一共搜查超過一百五十個目標住宅及處所，拘捕七名懷疑非法勞工及三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為七名男子，年齡介乎三十六至五十四歲。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主則為兩男一女，年齡介乎四十三至五十四歲。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

同時，入境處職員亦安排宣傳車及派員於屋苑內向住戶及物業管理人員派發「切勿聘用非法員工」的宣傳單張，呼籲切勿聘用非法勞工。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆者同罪。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"

This year's meeting focused on key issues including global and regional economic situations and outlooks, digital finance, and fiscal policies of member economies.

Mr Chan spoke at various sessions of the meeting. During the session on the global and regional economic outlooks, he remarked that global growth momentum has weakened amid rising challenges from unilateralism and tariffs. He stressed that the global economy is facing heightened uncertainty, with some economies having to choose between co-operation and coercion, as well as between shared prosperity and narrow self-interest. Against this backdrop, Hong Kong, China remains firmly committed to upholding a free and open trade and investment environment, providing global enterprises and investors with a stable, consistent and predictable business environment. He called on all member economies to safeguard a rules-based multilateral trading system and to work together in promoting sustainable regional economic growth.

At the session on digital finance, Mr Chan highlighted that blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly advancing digital financial services. These technologies not only improve efficiency and reduce costs, but also play a key role in driving financial inclusion. Drawing on Hong Kong, China's experience, he shared three key observations on developing a robust fintech ecosystem. First, financial innovation should serve the real economy. Strengthening data connectivity through public-private partnerships is essential to promoting inclusive and accessible financial services. For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI), a platform that enables small and medium-sized enterprises to share business data with banks to facilitate credit assessment. To date, the CDI has supported over 60 000 loan applications with loans granted exceeding US$6.5 billion. Second, regulators should encourage innovation to drive market developments while maintaining effective oversight. Hong Kong's financial regulatory bodies offer regulatory sandboxes that allow financial institutions and tech companies to test innovative fintech solutions, with feedback from regulators to help refine and improve these solutions before full-scale implementation. Third, in light of the increasingly widespread application of digital assets and AI in financial services, economies should place strong emphasis on ensuring that such innovations are responsible and sustainable - including the need to safeguard investor interests and maintain financial stability. Mr Chan stated that Hong Kong is actively engaged in cross-border co-operation and policy dialogue on digital finance, and stands ready to deepen collaboration with regional partners in these areas.

At the session on fiscal policy, Mr Chan shared Hong Kong, China's economic strategy, which includes solidifying its strengths as an international financial and trading centre, while fostering growth of emerging industries such as innovation and technology. He also outlined the Government's fiscal consolidation plan, which focuses primarily on containing expenditure growth, complemented by modest revenue measures based on user-pay and affordability principles. Meanwhile, it is leveraging private sector capital through public-private partnerships and bond issuances to expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, injecting new impetus into economic development.

During the meeting, Mr Chan also held bilateral discussions with the Chair of the Meeting, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Korea, Mr Koo Yun-cheol, to discuss further co-operation in trade, finance, and innovation and technology.

Mr Chan will attend the joint session of APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting and Structural Reform Ministerial Meeting tomorrow morning (October 22), before departing for Beijing. He will lead a government delegation to visit the Beijing subsidiary administrative centre and the Xiong'an New Area in Hebei."

One of them was also fined $1,000.

Customs officers intercepted a 62-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on October 11 and seized 1 781 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $7,300 and a duty potential of about $5,900 from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today in contravention of the DCO.

Also, Customs officers intercepted a 37-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on August 25. About 33 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 140 000 alternative smoking products, with a total estimated market value of about $573,000 and a duty potential of about $111,000, were seized from his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested. The man was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today in contravention of the DCO and IEO.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

The fifth seminar in the series, on the topic of ""Upholding Principles and Innovation in Chinese Arts and Culture and International Communication"", was delivered by Vice President of China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Professor Gao Shiming, and chaired by the Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the China Institute of Fudan University, Mr Eric Li, at the CSC today (October 21).

  Addressing the seminar, the Head of the CSC, Mr Oscar Kwok, said that Hong Kong is rooted in profound traditional Chinese culture while also being deeply influenced by Western culture, developing a cultural perspective that blends the East and the West. It is especially evident in the realm of popular culture, such as film and music, where Hong Kong has made unique contributions and has served as an important window for the world to appreciate the diverse charms of both Hong Kong and Chinese culture. Hong Kong thus serves as a ""cultural interpreter"" in strengthening international cultural exchange. Hong Kong attracts outstanding talent from around the world, boasts world-class arts and cultural infrastructure, and stands as one of the world's leading arts trading centres. As an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, Hong Kong should fully leverage its advantages to promote innovative development in arts and culture while advancing mutual learning among civilisations.

  About 140 civil servants in directorate, senior, and middle ranks from 39 bureaux/departments attended the seminar in person or online today.

  The Executive Series on Brokering North and South: China in a Multipolar World invites renowned scholars and leaders from the Mainland and overseas as guest speakers to inspire civil servants to reflect on the influence of China, as a major player in a multipolar world, on the global community amid the rise of the Global South and profound changes in the international landscape, and to explore how Hong Kong, as a city where East meets West, should leverage its strengths in its unique role in connecting the country with the world. It covers subjects pertaining to the rise of the Global South and international order, upholding principles and innovation in arts and culture and international communication, and a holistic approach to national security and global initiatives, among others."

•在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
•每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
•加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：
•先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
•在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
•塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
•孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
•先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；

今年財長會議聚焦討論環球和亞太區的經濟情況與展望、數字金融、各經濟體的公共財政政策等議題。

陳茂波在會上的各個環節都發言。在討論環球和區域經濟展望時，陳茂波表示，環球經濟增長在單邊主義和關稅的挑戰下有放緩的勢頭，當前世界經濟正面臨極大不確定性，一些經濟體還須面對合作與脅迫之間，以及共同繁榮與狹隘私利之間的抉擇。他指出，在這個背景下，中國香港堅定維持自由開放的貿易與投資環境，為全球企業和資本提供穩定、先後一致和可預期的營商環境。他呼籲各成員經濟體堅定維護以規則為本的多邊貿易體系，團結合作，推動區域經濟的可持續增長。

在討論數字金融的環節上，陳茂波指出，區塊鏈技術和人工智能正引領數字金融服務快速發展，它們不單能提升效率和降低成本，也有助推動普惠金融。他以中國香港的經驗，分享了對金融科技生態發展的三點意見。一、金融創新應服務實體經濟，而通過公私營合作，能推動更普惠包容的金融服務。他以數據互通為例，指出香港金融管理局推出「商業數據通」平台，通過數據共享以便利中小企融資，至今已支援逾6萬宗貸款申請，並批出超過65億美元的貸款。二、監管機構除履行監管職責外，亦應鼓勵創新，推動市場發展。他以香港金融監管機構的「監管沙盒」為例作說明，表示金融機構和創科公司均可利用這沙盒，測試其創新金融科技方案的可行性，過程中還可參考監管機構的回饋，以進一步改善其最後方案。三、在數字資產及人工智能越趨廣泛應用於金融服務的背景下，各經濟體應重視有關創新是否負責任和可持續，包括須顧及投資者利益和金融穩定。陳茂波表示，香港積極參與數字金融的跨境合作與政策對話，並願與區內夥伴深化在相關領域的合作。

在討論公共財政政策的環節上，陳茂波分享了中國香港的經濟發展策略，包括鞏固國際金融中心和貿易中心等優勢產業，並推動創科等新興產業發展。此外，他也簡介了政府的財政整合計劃，以控制政府開支增長為主，並按「用者自付」及「能者多付」的原則適度提高收入為輔。同時，亦會積極運用市場資源，例如公私營合作及發債等，以提速發展北部都會區，為經濟注入更大的發展動能。

陳茂波在出席財長會議期間也與會議主席、韓國經濟副總理兼企劃財政部長官具潤哲會面。雙方討論如何加強在經貿、金融和創科領域的合作。

陳茂波明日（十月二十二日）上午出席亞太經合組織財長會議與結構改革部長會議的聯合會議，其後轉往北京，率領政府代表團考察北京城市副中心和河北雄安新區。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-21 18:20,2025-10-21 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100698.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 21), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 42 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 086 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 12 to 18), showing a decrease compared to the previous week (October 5 to 11), which reported 2 257 cases. Most of the cases (795 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (241 cases), Shenzhen (202 cases) and Guangzhou (189 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;

​財政司司長在韓國仁川出席亞太經合組織財長會議（附圖／短片）,2025-10-21 18:20,2025-10-21 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100684.htm,"財政司司長陳茂波今日（十月二十一日）在韓國仁川出席亞太區經濟合作組織（亞太經合組織）財政部長會議（財長會議），並與會議主席、韓國經濟副總理兼企劃財政部長官具潤哲會面。

今年財長會議聚焦討論環球和亞太區的經濟情況與展望、數字金融、各經濟體的公共財政政策等議題。

陳茂波在會上的各個環節都發言。在討論環球和區域經濟展望時，陳茂波表示，環球經濟增長在單邊主義和關稅的挑戰下有放緩的勢頭，當前世界經濟正面臨極大不確定性，一些經濟體還須面對合作與脅迫之間，以及共同繁榮與狹隘私利之間的抉擇。他指出，在這個背景下，中國香港堅定維持自由開放的貿易與投資環境，為全球企業和資本提供穩定、先後一致和可預期的營商環境。他呼籲各成員經濟體堅定維護以規則為本的多邊貿易體系，團結合作，推動區域經濟的可持續增長。

在討論數字金融的環節上，陳茂波指出，區塊鏈技術和人工智能正引領數字金融服務快速發展，它們不單能提升效率和降低成本，也有助推動普惠金融。他以中國香港的經驗，分享了對金融科技生態發展的三點意見。一、金融創新應服務實體經濟，而通過公私營合作，能推動更普惠包容的金融服務。他以數據互通為例，指出香港金融管理局推出「商業數據通」平台，通過數據共享以便利中小企融資，至今已支援逾6萬宗貸款申請，並批出超過65億美元的貸款。二、監管機構除履行監管職責外，亦應鼓勵創新，推動市場發展。他以香港金融監管機構的「監管沙盒」為例作說明，表示金融機構和創科公司均可利用這沙盒，測試其創新金融科技方案的可行性，過程中還可參考監管機構的回饋，以進一步改善其最後方案。三、在數字資產及人工智能越趨廣泛應用於金融服務的背景下，各經濟體應重視有關創新是否負責任和可持續，包括須顧及投資者利益和金融穩定。陳茂波表示，香港積極參與數字金融的跨境合作與政策對話，並願與區內夥伴深化在相關領域的合作。

在討論公共財政政策的環節上，陳茂波分享了中國香港的經濟發展策略，包括鞏固國際金融中心和貿易中心等優勢產業，並推動創科等新興產業發展。此外，他也簡介了政府的財政整合計劃，以控制政府開支增長為主，並按「用者自付」及「能者多付」的原則適度提高收入為輔。同時，亦會積極運用市場資源，例如公私營合作及發債等，以提速發展北部都會區，為經濟注入更大的發展動能。

陳茂波在出席財長會議期間也與會議主席、韓國經濟副總理兼企劃財政部長官具潤哲會面。雙方討論如何加強在經貿、金融和創科領域的合作。

陳茂波明日（十月二十二日）上午出席亞太經合組織財長會議與結構改革部長會議的聯合會議，其後轉往北京，率領政府代表團考察北京城市副中心和河北雄安新區。"

The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, presented ""Chronicle of the Hong Kong-Kowloon Brigade (Revised Edition)"" to representatives of school councils and school heads' associations to enhance learning and teaching effectiveness of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression with enriched content.

Addressing the event, Dr Choi said that during the period of the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Independent Brigade of the East River Column steadfastly resisted Japanese aggression, and rescued trapped cultural figures and allied members, making significant contributions to the War of Resistance efforts in Hong Kong and across the country. ""Chronicle of the Hong Kong-Kowloon Brigade (Revised Edition)"" is a very precious historical record of the War of Resistance. Dr Choi said she expected that schools would incorporate the content of the book into the learning and teaching of relevant subjects, deepening students' understanding of Hong Kong's participation in the War of Resistance. This way, students could appreciate the indomitable spirit of the Chinese nation, cherish the hard-earned peace and prosperity today, and be inspired to contribute to the country and society.

She noted that in order to implement the initiatives outlined in the Policy Address to advance patriotic education, the EDB continuously adopts a multipronged and co-ordinated approach to integrate patriotic education into daily learning and teaching for strengthening students' affection for and sense of belonging to the country.

  Co-Chief Editor of ""Chronicle of the Hong Kong-Kowloon Brigade (Revised Edition)"" Professor Lau Chi-pang hosted the subsequent thematic talk which was about the development, history and contributions of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Independent Brigade of the East River Column during the War of Resistance.

Other guests attending the event included the Under Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Clement Woo; Co-Chief Editor of ""Chronicle of the Hong Kong-Kowloon Brigade (Revised Edition)"" Professor Liu Shuyong; members of the Working Group on Patriotic Education, Professor Gu Minkang and Mr Kwok Wing-keung; representatives from school councils and school heads associations of primary and secondary schools, and principals and teachers from primary and secondary schools.

Mr Tse welcomed the delegation and said that the HKSAR Government attaches great importance to the local agriculture and fisheries industries and promotes their sustainable development by complementing the direction of national development. The HKSAR Government will continue to implement measures under the Blueprint for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and Fisheries to helpfishermen/farmers switch to modernised and sustainable operation modes, attract more young people to join the industry, integrate into the development plan of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and enhance the quality, quantity, and output value of local agricultural and fisheries products in the long run.

The Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, Mr Mickey Lai, introduced to the delegation the Government's work in supporting the development of the agriculture and fisheries industries, including developing deep-sea mariculture in new fish culture zones, launching the ""Fish enJoy"" Scheme to promote leisure fisheries, developing urban farming, and promoting the development of a multi-storey, modernised, and environmentally friendly pig farm by the industry.

Through inspecting the landing and sale of catches at the Aberdeen Wholesale Fish Market, the delegation understood that the FMO has been providing the fisheries industry with services such as wholesale of chilled fish and live seafood, supply of clean seawater, as well as promoting local fisheries products. All profits are then used to support the development of local fisheries, including improving market services and facilities and providing low-interest loans to fishermen. The delegation also met with local fishermen and tasted local processed speciality fisheries products.

The FMO, established under the Marine Fish (Marketing) Ordinance (Cap. 291), is a financially independent non-profit organisation led by the Director of Marketing, a post concurrently held by the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation. The Aberdeen Wholesale Fish Market is one of the busiest fish wholesale markets under the FMO. In 2024, the market handled approximately 4970tonnes of chilled marine fish and about 3622tonnes of live seafood, accounting for around 15 per cent and nearly 50 per cent of the FMO's total wholesale volume, respectively."

謝展寰歡迎國家代表團到訪時表示，特區政府十分重視本地漁農業，並會配合國家發展方向促進漁農業可持續發展。特區政府會繼續推動《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》下的措施，協助漁農民轉型至現代化和可持續作業模式，期望可以吸引更多年輕人投身業界，並融入粵港澳大灣區的發展布局，長遠提升本地漁農產品的質、量和產值。

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）署長黎堅明向代表團介紹特區政府在支持漁農業發展的工作，包括在新魚類養殖區發展深海養殖、推出「漁＋樂」魚場計劃以推動休閒漁業、發展都市農業，以及推動業界發展多層式現代化環保養豬場等。

代表團透過在香港仔魚類批發市場調研漁獲上岸及銷售情況，了解魚統處為漁業界提供的服務涵蓋冰鮮海魚批銷服務、活海鮮批發和潔淨海水供應服務，以及推廣本地漁產品；而所得盈餘都用於支援本地漁業的發展，包括改善市場服務和設施，以及為漁民提供低息貸款等。代表團亦與本地漁民代表會面及品嘗本地具特色的加工漁產品。

魚統處根據香港法例第291章《海魚（統營）條例》成立，為財政獨立的非牟利機構，由統營處處長領導，現時該職位由漁護署署長兼任。香港仔魚類批發市場是魚統處轄下其中一個最繁忙的魚類批發市場，二○二四年經該魚市場批銷的冰鮮海魚和活海產約4 970公噸和約3 622公噸，分別佔魚統處整體批銷量約一成半和近五成。"
Celebration of the 60th Anniversary of Dongjiang Water Supply to Hong Kong - Good Water Good Fish Logo Design Competition results announced (with photos),2025-10-21 17:15,2025-10-21 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100608.htm,"To celebrate the 60th anniversary of Dongjiang's water supply to Hong Kong, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) organised the Good Water Good Fish Logo Design Competition with an aim of conveying an important message that local reservoirs being able to produce high-quality reservoir fish is attributable to the high-quality Dongjiang water stored in them. The competition attracted an overwhelming response, with nearly 500 entries received from Hong Kong and other places. Judging was held today (October 21), during which a champion, first runner-up, and second runner-up were selected. The adjudication panel comprised internationally renowned artist Dr Kan Tai-keung; Legislative Council Member (Tourism) Mr Perry Yiu; the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Water Supplies, Professor Joseph Kwan; the Director of Water Supplies, Mr Roger Wong; as well as representatives from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, the design industry, and the fisheries sector.

Mr Wong remarked that over the past 60 years, the country has mobilised a large amount of labour and resources to implement a number of expansion and improvement works as well as ecological conservation measures along the Dongjiang River Basin, in which development has been strictly restricted with activities such as quarrying, mining, and large-scale livestock farming prohibited within protected zones to safeguard the quality of Dongjiang water supplied to Hong Kong. Dongjiang water stored in local reservoirs in Hong Kong can thus nurture high-quality fish, with the traditional wisdom ""To cultivate good fish, one must first maintain good water"" being proved right. The number of entries for the competition has exceeded expectations, with many high-quality entries received. The winning entry will be used as the logo for high-quality fish products from local reservoirs.

The WSD regularly releases fish fry into local reservoirs and catches mature fish to maintain an ecological balance and preserve good water quality. The local Plover Cove Reservoir was registered as an accredited fish farm at the end of 2024 and received its organic aquaculture certification in August this year. The fish caught from this reservoir are recognised for their remarkable quality. To make efficient use of these resources in reservoirs and promote local high-quality fish products, the WSD is collaborating with the Fish Marketing Organization to produce umami fish soup products and 100 per cent local mud carp siu mai, which were first offered for sale at the Hong Kong Food Expo this August. Additionally, some fish products are donated to non-profit organisations to benefit the community."

黃恩諾表示，過去六十年，國家動用了大量人力及物力推行多項擴建、改造工程及生態環保措施，並限制開發東江流域沿線保護區，以及在受保護範圍內禁止採石、開礦及進行大規模禽畜養殖等活動，以保障供港東江水水質，香港用以儲存東江水的水塘才能孕育出優質魚，體現民間智慧「養好魚先養好水」。今次參賽作品數目超出預期，收到許多高質素的作品。冠軍作品將用作本地水塘優質魚產品的品牌標誌。

水務署定期在水塘投放魚苗並撈捕已完全成長的魚，以維持水塘生態平衡及水質優良。其中，本地水塘船灣淡水湖繼去年底成功註冊為優質養魚場，今年八月亦獲頒發有機水產養殖認證，魚類的質量備受認可。為善用資源和推廣本地優質魚產品，水務署聯同魚類統營處推出鮮味魚湯系列以及百分百香港本地鯪魚燒賣，於今年八月的香港美食博覽首次公開發售。另外，部分魚產品將贈予非牟利機構，藉此向社區表達關懷。"

政務司副司長出席2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-21 16:53,2025-10-21 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100500.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（十月二十一日）出席2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮的致辭：

衣學東主任（國務院國有資產監督管理委員會研究中心主任）、張政偉主任（國際可持續準則理事會主席特別顧問兼北京辦公室主任）、李萌副處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部金融處副處長）、鄭勇男副董事長（香港大公文匯傳媒集團副董事長、總經理）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家好！很高興參加由香港大公文匯傳媒集團舉辦的2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮。

行政長官的二○二五年《施政報告》推出了數項有利於推動環境、社會及企業管治（ESG）發展的舉措，包括：推動新能源產業發展，加速綠色技術落地，例如建設可持續航空燃料產業鏈和落實《香港氫能發展策略》；以及推動綠色創科成果商品化，例如支持市場發展換電型電動車及自動化換電站技術，和推動市場加快為現有建築物減碳等。

今天活動的主題名為「綠色金融匯聚，價值共創新生」，展示了推動ESG發展和綠色金融的密切關係。接下來，我想與大家分享香港在綠色和可持續金融方面的最新發展。

作為國際金融中心，香港正朝着國際綠色金融中心的方向邁進。香港擁有既深且廣的資本市場，能為不同發展階段的企業提供多元化的投融資渠道，同時把國際資金引導至優質的可持續發展項目。截至今年六月，獲證券及期貨事務監察委員會認可的ESG基金超過200隻，資產管理規模超過1.1萬億港元，分別較三年前增加51%及18%。在債券市場方面，去年在香港安排發行的綠色和可持續債券總額約3,354億港元，佔地區總額約四成半，並自二○一八年起連續七年居於亞洲區市場的首位。此外，在政府可持續債券計劃下，我們自二○一九年起已成功發行合共約2,400億港元等值的政府綠色債券，涵蓋不同類型、貨幣種類和年期，為多個本地綠色項目融資，並為潛在發行人提供重要基準。

香港是全球領先的可持續金融樞紐。特區政府全力推動符合國際標準、且一致和可比較的氣候及可持續發展的相關資訊的披露，以提升資本市場就相關資訊的透明度，便利投資者作出投資決策。去年十二月，我們推出《香港可持續披露路線圖》，就大型公眾責任實體不遲於二○二八年全面採用國際財務報告可持續披露準則（簡稱ISSB準則）提供清晰的路徑。今年六月，香港亦獲得國際財務報告準則基金會確認為首批以全面採用ISSB準則為目標的司法管轄區，顯示香港作為推動採用ISSB準則的先鋒。

為更好地結合金融科技和綠色金融，推動經濟綠色轉型，我們積極拓展綠色金融科技的生態圈，打造香港成為綠色金融科技樞紐。政府於去年六月推出全新的綠色和可持續金融科技概念驗證測試資助計劃，提供前期資助，推動進行綠色金融科技活動的科技公司或研究機構與本地企業合作，開發處理行業痛點的新項目，助力有關方案商業化和完成概念驗證。該計劃至今已批出60個綠色金融科技方案，並正陸續通過概念驗證，讓有潛力的綠色和可持續金融科技能在香港的商業環境中更廣泛應用。

嘉賓們、朋友們，ESG生態圈的發展有賴我們每一位的積極參與和支持。我呼籲在座各位把握今天的機會，與其他參加者交流討論，就推動香港以至全球綠色轉型及可持續未來的工作，貢獻智慧和力量。我亦祝賀今年在香港國際ESG年度榜單評選中獲獎的80間公司及機構。感謝你們為ESG建設作出的卓越貢獻，不但鼓勵更多企業走向綠色轉型，同時亦向世界展示國家在推動ESG發展和管理中的積極性和進步性。

最後，我亦想為一件關係香港未來的大事，作出呼籲。立法會的高水平、有效運作，對推動香港的經濟社會發展，至為關鍵。第八屆立法會的選舉，將在十二月七日舉行。我請大家到時踴躍參與投票，以手上一票，為「一國兩制」在香港的成功實踐行穩致遠，以及特區良政善治、長治久安和美好的未來，盡愛國愛港者的責任，貢獻力量。謝謝大家。​"

大家好！很高興參加由香港大公文匯傳媒集團舉辦的2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮。

行政長官的二○二五年《施政報告》推出了數項有利於推動環境、社會及企業管治（ESG）發展的舉措，包括：推動新能源產業發展，加速綠色技術落地，例如建設可持續航空燃料產業鏈和落實《香港氫能發展策略》；以及推動綠色創科成果商品化，例如支持市場發展換電型電動車及自動化換電站技術，和推動市場加快為現有建築物減碳等。

今天活動的主題名為「綠色金融匯聚，價值共創新生」，展示了推動ESG發展和綠色金融的密切關係。接下來，我想與大家分享香港在綠色和可持續金融方面的最新發展。

作為國際金融中心，香港正朝着國際綠色金融中心的方向邁進。香港擁有既深且廣的資本市場，能為不同發展階段的企業提供多元化的投融資渠道，同時把國際資金引導至優質的可持續發展項目。截至今年六月，獲證券及期貨事務監察委員會認可的ESG基金超過200隻，資產管理規模超過1.1萬億港元，分別較三年前增加51%及18%。在債券市場方面，去年在香港安排發行的綠色和可持續債券總額約3,354億港元，佔地區總額約四成半，並自二○一八年起連續七年居於亞洲區市場的首位。此外，在政府可持續債券計劃下，我們自二○一九年起已成功發行合共約2,400億港元等值的政府綠色債券，涵蓋不同類型、貨幣種類和年期，為多個本地綠色項目融資，並為潛在發行人提供重要基準。

海關當日根據風檢評估於機場海關驗貨場檢查一個從沙特阿拉伯進口，報稱載有魚乾的空運貨物。經查驗後，海關人員在其中五個紙箱內檢獲該批懷疑受管制海參。一名貨物收貨人被捕。

案件仍在調查中，不排除會有更多人被捕。

海關會繼續透過風險評估和情報分析，嚴厲打擊各類型走私活動。

走私受管制瀕危物種屬嚴重罪行，根據《保護瀕危動植物物種條例》，任何人如非按照《條例》規定進出口或管有瀕危物種均屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁十年。

Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case of suspected scheduled endangered species by air (with photo),2025-10-21 16:45,2025-10-21 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100587.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on October 18 detected an air freight smuggling case of suspected scheduled endangered species and seized about 202 kilograms of suspected scheduled sea cucumbers with an estimated market value of about $520,000 at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA).

Based on risk assessment, Customs on that day examined an inbound air cargo consignment from Saudi Arabia, declared as dried fish, at the Customs Cargo Examination Compound at HKIA. Upon inspection, Customs officers found the batch of suspected scheduled sea cucumbers in five carton boxes therein. A cargo recipient was arrested.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of more arrests is not ruled out.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement actions against all kinds of smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Smuggling of scheduled endangered species is a serious offence. Under the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance, anyone importing, exporting or possessing specimens of endangered species not in accordance with the Ordinance commits an offence and will be liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for 10 years upon conviction.

以下是立法會內務委員會主席李慧琼今日（十月二十一日）於立法會綜合大樓會見傳媒的發言︰

早前的內務委員會會議上，議員同意由我以內務委員會主席身分，在明日的立法會會議上，動議告别議案。

近日，有不同議員就告别議案的安排，向我表達意見。有部分議員關注到，新一屆立法會選舉提名期於十月二十四日，即星期五開始，與最後一次立法會會議辯論時間其實是非常接近，而最新的評估是，選情是異常激烈，亦有部分議員擔心，如果在立法會會議上進行告別議案辯論，有可能對選舉造成不公平。

亦有部分議員向我表達，由於選舉提名期即將展開，希望爭取更多時間聚焦處理選舉事宜。當然亦有部分議員希望繼續辯論。

經過審慎考慮所有因素，並與核心組的成員商量，以及跟不同議員溝通後，我決定撤回動議告別議案的預告，讓議員可以更加聚焦處理議會工作，亦確保選舉的公平性。"

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由十月二十日中午截至今日（十月二十一日）中午，食安中心已對219個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 20 to noon today (October 21), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 219 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 173 992 samples of food imported from Japan (including 113 543 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 39 158 samples of local catch respectively.

尊敬的黃濤先生（騰雲加速器聯合創始人、世紀金源集團總裁）、方方先生（騰雲加速器聯合創始人、香港水木投資集團合夥人）、張鈺晶會長（中國機電產品進出口商會會長）、鄭松岩總裁（香港數碼港管理有限公司行政總裁）、葛明博士（工業專員（創新及科技））、謝副局長（深圳市前海深港現代服務業合作區管理局副局長謝暉暉）、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：

大家好！今天我非常高興與各位一同見證騰雲香港科創集群加速器落戶數碼港。

初創企業的蓬勃發展對一個地區科技創新和產業創新的發展至關重要：除了為經濟提供新動能和更多可能性之外，同時可以匯聚資源、吸引人才。在特區政府的大力推動下，香港初創企業數目去年已經達到4 700間，這些都顯示了香港的創科初創生態發展日益蓬勃。

為進一步完善本地創科生態圈，加快推動香港發展成為國際創新科技中心，行政長官在去年的《施政報告》中提出創科加速器先導計劃，目的是吸引海內外具豐富經驗的初創加速器落戶香港，建立加速器基地，進一步豐富本地專業初創服務。該計劃上月已獲得立法會財務委員會通過撥款，將為香港的初創企業提供更全面和精準的扶持，促進初創企業做大做強。

騰雲香港科創集群加速器的成立及啓用響應了特區政府扶持初創企業的政策方向。我非常感謝黃濤先生、方方先生等一批企業家、投資銀行家，以及行業專家共同發起成立騰雲加速器，攜同70多家聚焦人工智能、生物醫藥、醫療器械、能源科技等領域的優秀創科企業及投資機構來港發展，利用數碼港的優勢，為進駐的企業提供全面服務，助其在香港落地、布局、發展。加上特區政府即將推出的優化版創科創投基金及即將在明年推出全新的創科產業引導基金，將為香港創科企業的發展創造更為有利的條件。

香港是國家「引進來、走出去」的雙向通道，亦是內地企業進軍海外市場的首選出海平台。特區政府銳意發展創科，有別於以往企業需要個別建立或引進的模式，加速器的成立可以一次性地引進以支持大批初創企業並提供更精準及具系統性的支援，產生集群效應，體現香港支持初創企業發展質和量的提升。我歡迎騰雲加速器引入的多間優秀創科企業及投資機構來港發展，也期望不久的將來有更多優秀的加速器基地在港成立，共同深耕香港的創科樂土。

最後，祝賀騰雲加速器和在座各位業務蒸蒸日上！祝國家及香港的創科品牌在國際舞台上越發亮麗！謝謝大家！"

Mr Walsh (Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Mr Willie Walsh), Patrick (Chair of Cathay Group, Mr Patrick Healy), Ronald (Chief Executive Officer of Cathay Group, Mr Ronald Lam), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

A warm welcome and good morning to you all. For friends from afar, welcome to Hong Kong. It is my great honour to address this esteemed gathering this morning at the World Sustainability Symposium. I stand before you today with a deep sense of purpose, as we come together to chart a path toward a more sustainable future for the aviation industry globally and for Hong Kong.

First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to IATA and the Cathay Group for inviting me to speak at this prestigious occasion, which is one of IATA's signature events of the year. It is a fitting choice for you to host the third edition of the symposium here in Hong Kong - a city that we all love and has emerged as a leading player in sustainable aviation in the region. I have heard that this year's edition has brought together nearly 500 participants from all over the world, including senior executives, professional experts, and thought leaders in the field of green aviation. I warmly welcome all of you to Hong Kong and sincerely hope you take some time to explore and enjoy the vibrancy and warmth in Hong Kong. This hotel is well-situated, where you can have a good perspective of our harbour.

My bureau oversees not only aviation but also land transport, maritime and logistics. Not only are we charting a path towards green aviation, we have also promulgated a series of action plans and blueprints to promote green transport and green shipping.

Our presence here today underscores a shared commitment to achieving a sustainable future for aviation. With so many distinguished experts in the room, I need not reiterate the critical importance of sustainability and decarbonisation in the aviation sector. This symposium provides a unique platform for leaders from around the world to exchange perspectives and provide solutions on green aviation. As we embark on this dialogue, I would like to begin by sharing Hong Kong's achievements and our forward-looking blueprint for building a sustainable aviation ecosystem.

When we speak of sustainability in aviation, our recent focus must be on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. This is indeed a complex and multifaceted challenge that demands co-operation and collaboration amongst a wide array of stakeholders, including governments, airlines, fuel suppliers, industry partners, and the traveling public. In Hong Kong, we are taking decisive steps to develop a SAF industry and promote the use of it at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). In our view, it is of utmost importance that we join hands to scale up the production of SAF, as we all know that it is currently the only practical means for international aviation to decarbonise.

The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is dedicated to fostering a robust SAF supply and its supply chain in collaboration with Mainland authorities and local enterprises, from upstream raw material collection to the establishment of production plants and large-scale production and supply. Given Hong Kong's close proximity to the Chinese Mainland, which has the largest supply of used cooking oil, we are leveraging this advantage to create a significant SAF supply for Hong Kong. Moreover, as 100 per cent neat SAF cannot be uplifted to aircraft at this moment, we are actively exploring the construction of a SAF blending facility right here in Hong Kong. This facility aims to support the provision of competitively priced SAF-blended jet fuel in the long run, hence raising the competitiveness of Hong Kong's SAF industry. By doing so, we also aim to strengthen the bargaining power of airlines operating from HKIA, ultimately fostering HKIA's competitiveness as an international aviation hub.

On this floor, I know that Cathay Pacific Group has been leading and is very dedicated in pushing forward the use of SAF. Of course, we would work closely with Cathay as our close partner. We are also mindful of the pragmatic and practical considerations faced by different airlines in Hong Kong. In a way, we hope to create a critical mass and to achieve and secure a reasonably priced SAF supply and production to enable us to create a robust supply chain for SAF in Hong Kong. With the above measures in place and subject to regional SAF industry development, we adopt a vision to achieve a SAF consumption ratio of 1 per cent to 2 per cent for flights departing from HKIA by 2030 as a starting point to drive momentum.

  ""The Chief Executive's Policy Address"" announced just last month includes quite some paragraphs on how we would strive ourselves to achieve the SAF consumption target. We, in a recent briefing for our legislature, disclosed the target that I mentioned just now. I received a lot of feedback asking whether Hong Kong could set a more aggressive target. Replying to the stakeholders and the legislative councillors was that we want to be pragmatic and realistic. We want to put it into action. So, we set a target which we hope to achieve. That is a starting point, and this should not preclude or hinder us from setting an even more aggressive target along the way.

Apart from the industry and aviation partners, I think public education is also very important. As we take people along from places to places, the travelling public need to raise their awareness for green aviation. It helps build a collective understanding of the role SAF plays in reducing aviation's carbon footprint. The Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) will, for instance, launch targeted publicity and promotional campaigns to raise awareness among the public and corporations about the importance of SAF, and the need for everyone to do their part. By engaging communities and businesses, we aim to create a culture of sustainability that supports long-term environmental goals. I think this culture of sustainability is the basic, core element and spirit that IATA has also been promoting around the globe.

Speaking of AAHK, I am proud to highlight their unwavering commitment to sustainability. Apart from SAF that I spoke of a lot, together with key aviation-related business partners, AAHK is dedicated to achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2050, a bold step making HKIA the world's greenest airport. Their efforts to embed sustainability into new developments at HKIA, integrate environmental best interests and practices, and address climate change and resilience given the airport's coastal location have all gained significant momentum. Initiatives such as trialing renewable diesel, expanding the use of electric and autonomous vehicles on the Airport Island, as well as continuously upgrading its equipment by incorporating more energy-efficient installation and technologies reflect a holistic approach to sustainable development at HKIA.

We are all acutely aware that the journey to a sustainable future in the aviation sector is not a solo mission. It is a global challenge and mission that requires collaboration across borders, industries, and sectors. The HKSAR Government is committed to playing a pivotal role by leading, offering policy support, driving innovation and technology, and most importantly, cultivating an enabling environment for sustainable aviation. Our door is always open. We will maintain close communication with international organisations, airlines, the airport community, fuel suppliers and industry stakeholders to tackle pressing challenges and difficulties. As Dr Thomsen (Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist of IATA, Dr Marie Owens Thomsen) just mentioned, it is not just saying when there is a will, there is a way. We have to create ways so as to make our will works. It is the time not for words, but for action.

Last but not least, international collaboration is paramount in this endeavor. No single city, country, or organisation can achieve net zero alone. We must share knowledge, pool resources and align our strategies to create a unified global response to the climate crisis. We have been facing very frequent super typhoons over the past weeks and months in Hong Kong, which is quite unprecedented. Our airport and aviation community have been making our best efforts to respond, recover and resurrect, but nothing is more important than tackling this issue at the heart of the problem and do it with passion and determination. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why gatherings like this symposium are vital for fostering such partnerships.

I truly look forward to the rich discussions and innovative insights that will emerge from this symposium, sparking actionable outcomes. And with the talent and the dedication I see in this room, I am more than confident that we can turn the vision of net zero by 2050 into a reality. It's a goal championed by IATA, but it's a future we will build together.

Lastly, I wish you all productive, inspiring and impactful sessions ahead. Thank you very much.

Speech by DSJ at International Conference of Legal Regulators 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-10-21 12:37,2025-10-21 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100371.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the International Conference of Legal Regulators 2025 today (October 21):

President Tong (President of The Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Roden Tong), Dr Kelvin Wong (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you all at the International Conference of Legal Regulators today. My warmest welcome to the leaders and representatives from across the global legal regulatory community. I am particularly delighted that Hong Kong has been chosen as the venue for hosting the conference this year. Your presence here reflects our shared commitment to upholding the highest standards of the legal profession.

  The theme of this year's Conference, ""New Ways to Regulate in a Changing World?"", is not only timely but profoundly critical. We are navigating an era of unprecedented and simultaneous transformation. Breakthroughs in technology and global economic shifts present both opportunities and challenges for legal regulators worldwide. Our discussions over the coming days will focus on fostering a resilient and adaptive regulatory environment, which is essential for upholding the rule of law.

  In Hong Kong, our approach to these global challenges is firmly anchored in our constitutional principle of ""one country, two systems"". This principle, enshrined in our Basic Law, is the bedrock of our success and stability. It is the foundation that underpins our common law system, which continues to operate robustly.

  Central to this system is the independent exercise of legal and regulatory powers. Our Judiciary exercises independent judicial power free from any interference. Similarly, the regulation of legal practitioners is handled independently by the legal profession itself. The Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association, as the self-regulatory bodies for their respective professions, perform this critical function with the highest degree of professionalism, integrity, and diligence. Their work in upholding stringent ethical standards, ensuring professional competence, and administering a fair disciplinary system is conducted strictly in accordance with the law, free from interference. This independent self-regulation is a cornerstone of our legal framework and a key reason for the immense international confidence placed in Hong Kong's status as a leading international legal and dispute resolution hub.

  While our foundations are strong, we are facing several new challenges.

  First, technological disruption, particularly the development of artificial intelligence (AI), is fundamentally reshaping the practice of law. These tools offer potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve access to justice. However, they also pose regulatory questions on accountability, confidentiality of clients, and ethical practice.

  At present, the laws in Hong Kong protect the legitimate rights and interests of individuals, enterprises and various other organisations in different spheres. To manage potential risks in promoting the ongoing technological development, the Department of Justice will establish an interdepartmental working group to review the legislation needed to support a wider application of AI. This initiative is part of our broader strategy to encourage AI applications across different sectors, while ensuring that regulatory frameworks keep pace with technological advancements.

  Second, the expansion of cross-border trade amplifies the need for mediation and arbitration, which in turn necessitates a stronger regulatory framework for such services. The Department of Justice established the Working Group on Mediation Regulatory System in October last year to review the regulatory system for the accreditation and disciplinary matters of the mediation profession in Hong Kong, and to make recommendations on enhancing the professionalism of mediators. We will implement measures for strengthening the system for the mediation profession in Hong Kong by the end of this year, as well as take forward the relevant legislative work next year. These efforts aim at ensuring our regulatory frameworks remain fit for purpose in a globalised and increasingly mediated legal environment.

  Third, the increasing cross-border nature of legal practice challenges our traditionally jurisdiction-specific regulatory models. This requires the enhancement of cross-border co-operation. Exchange of insights, sharing of best practices, and building mutual understanding through collaboration is necessary.

  Hong Kong is proud to contribute to this vital global conversation. Our unique position as a gateway between the East and the West, along with our professional legal sector and robust common law system, make us a ""super connector"" in the field of legal regulation.

  Through this conference, we can pioneer the new regulatory pathways. I have every expectation that your deliberations over the next two days will be immensely stimulating, pioneering, and productive.

  I thank The Law Society of Hong Kong once again for its sterling efforts in hosting this pivotal event. To our distinguished international guests, I wish you a successful conference and a delightful stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."
