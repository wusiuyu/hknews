Remarks by SHYA and SLW at media session regarding follow-up work on No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po,2025-11-29 13:40,2025-11-29 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900394.htm,"  The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, and the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media today (November 29) regarding the follow-up work on the No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, after attending a radio programme. Following are their remarks at the media session:

Reporter: Miss Mak, you earlier mentioned that the Government is planning to roll out an e-platform for people who are willing to donate supplies to those in need to register on the platform. Could you tell us maybe how soon the public can expect the platform to be set up? Would the Government consider adding more services? Given that we can see a lot of volunteers at Tai Po, apart from offering supplies, some of them are offering like counselling services.

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: Definitely, the e-platform is going to be launched in these few days, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry has talked to me that the platform can be rolled out in these few days. Before the rolling out of the platform, the public can reach us through our WhatsApp hotline, 9213 2388. If anybody wants to offer voluntary services or resources that can be offered to our residents, please do register through this Whatsapp platform. Moreover, the Information Services Department has already launched a website for this incident, the website address is www.taipofire.gov.hk. We have provided all the relevant information, including government hotlines and services available by the NGOs. The public can find the appropriate information through this website, thank you.

Reporter: Mr Sun, you earlier mentioned that a notice was issued last week on the fire prevention because there are reports saying that workers were seen smoking at the site. In your point of view, what can the Government do more to ensure that, contractors in similar cases really take action to avoid violating rules and regulations or even possibly leading to incidents like this? Also, we know that a number of domestic helpers were still missing in the incident and many of the Filipinos or Indonesians are still looking for them. Will the Government help them, and does the Government have any idea on how to assist these people?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. Since July last year, the Labour Department (LD) has conducted six rounds of inspections to the Wang Fuk Court site. Over the 16 inspections, the LD has issued six improvement notices and also carried out three prosecutions, mainly concerning safety of workers. The major concern at that time was the safety of working at height. This is the major concern. During the inspections, the LD has also issued written warning to the contractors over the importance of fire safety. The last inspection was conducted on November 20. At that inspection, the LD also issued a written warning to the contractor, reminding it of the importance of fire safety. It is because one of the complaints received was about smoking of workers at the site. The LD have taken a precautionary measure of warning the contractors.

As for the foreign domestic helpers, the LD is also working together with the two Consulates in Hong Kong. That includes a visit on-site to Tai Po so that they could look for, and also help the foreign domestic helpers on site. We are receiving more information from the two Consulates, including confirmed death of at least two Indonesian foreign domestic helpers and also a number of them are still missing. I have to thank the foreign domestic helpers at Wang Fuk Court. We understand many of them took care of elderly people and children at the Court. We know, many of them stayed inside together with their employers, taking care of them even at the height of the fire. You can be rest assured, we will provide all the necessary assistance to all the foreign domestic workers and make sure their stay in Hong Kong is safe, and to cater to their needs.

Reporter: How would the condolence money be distributed to domestic helpers?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: The Government will offer $200,000 condolence donation to those families with deceased. Social workers from the Social Welfare Department will contact these families and facilitate the distribution of the money.

民政及青年事務局局長和勞工及福利局局長會見傳媒答問內容,2025-11-29 13:38,2025-11-29 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900386.htm,"民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十一月二十九日）出席電台節目後就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的答問內容：

記者：有消息指關愛隊報警要求義工離開現場，由他們接手。可否說說有沒有這件事？

民政及青年事務局局長：民政處（民政事務處）有責任協助所有受影響的居民，提供安置服務，所以我們開放臨時庇護中心。這些臨時庇護中心一向是由民政處負責管理，因為要確保中心內的秩序，保護每一個中心使用者的安全和私隱。最近某些中心已經有零星個案，有使用者身體不適，需要安排醫療服務，所以中心內的秩序、衞生，以及能確保每一位中心使用者的安全和私隱，是我們要盡的責任。

至於網上流傳稱有報警或是其他情況，其實警方已經作出澄清。首先，我們沒有人報警，警方亦沒有收到有人報案。希望大家認清事實，一起團結一致，不分彼此，為受影響的居民提供適切的服務。大家要將心比己想想，受影響居民的家園經過這麼大改變，他們要到庇護中心暫住，大家是否都希望給他們一個比較好的環境，私隱度高一點和安全的環境，讓他們可以在那裏休息呢？所以我們所做的一切都是希望讓受影響居民，可以在庇護中心有一個地方稍作休息。

現在我們最迫切要做的，是希望可以安排他們到酒店或青年宿舍，讓他們有更好的環境休息，因為他們現在無論在心理上或精神上都承受很大壓力，當然在物資和支援上我們都會繼續提供協助。

記者：想請問就事件中有外籍家庭傭工（外傭）離世，接下來政府會如何協助他們和其家屬？之後有否陸續收到其他外傭的求助？

勞工及福利局局長：有關在宏福苑工作的外傭，勞工處已聯同兩個領事館──印尼駐港領事館及菲律賓駐港領事館，進行了一次現場視察，亦已通過兩個領事館聯合提供必要的協助。我們理解，最少有兩名印尼籍外傭證實在今次的大火中不幸身故。另外，有幾名外傭的下落尚在尋找當中，他們都有「登記簿」，若他們登記的居住地址是在宏福苑，兩個領事館都會嘗試聯絡他們，現時有一部分還未聯絡到。就外傭而言，如果是不幸身故，現在的標準僱傭合約已有相關安排。香港有三十多萬名外傭，一年之中都有些不幸身故，一直都可以通過我們的標準合約作安排，包括將他們的遺體運回其家鄉，以及經外傭的保險安排適當的賠償，這個大家可以放心，我們可以循現有的辦法處理得到。另外，我們亦會特事特辦，外傭是有個指定居所並需要住在其報稱的僱主居所。自宏福苑火警後，他們固然沒辦法繼續入住該居所。因此，我們會在這方面特事特辦，為他們安排好，確保他們在香港這段期間不會違反任何有關外傭逗留條件的要求。

民政及青年事務局局長：想補充一點，剛才提及的外傭問題，政府會為每一個不幸過世死者的家屬提供20萬元的慰問金，不幸過世的外傭的家屬都可以領取20萬元慰問金。

至於網上平台，首先我要再次感謝大家都很關心宏福苑受影響的居民，所以大家都有很多物資，或者有一些學會提供一些專業的服務。為了讓居民更好、更方便，在適當的時候得到適當的物資，我們希望大家可以通知我們，向我們登記，讓我們能做配對，尤其是現在我們的物資在庇護中心已經足夠了。反而可能稍後，當我們安排了居民到長期的居所，那些長期的居所包括我們找到一千八百個單位，來自過渡性房屋和房協（香港房屋協會）的專用屋邨，屆時可能需要為他們添置一些家居設施，我們便需要再有其他物資，所以希望大家屆時可以幫忙。

我們希望大家可以在平台登記。現在，創新科技及工業局和一些創科界的朋友正在為我們製作這個平台。我相信這一兩天便可以完成。這個平台設立之前，大家也可以透過一個WhatsApp電話登記，就是9213 2388。大家可以在WhatsApp登記你的資料，或者你可以提供的物資；又或者如果你是一個專業組織，你可以提供一些義工服務，你可以登記，讓我們知道有甚麼朋友能幫忙。如果你是專業學會，想為居民提供一些情緒上的支援，你們有熱線，便可以把這些資料給我們。

政府新聞處也成立了一個網站，就是大埔宏福苑支援服務的專題網站，英文網址是www.taipofire.gov.hk。網站列出了所有政府的查詢熱線，還有專業組織提供的服務熱線，希望我們可以好好安排，令受影響的居民能夠有序地得到物資支援，資金上的支援，甚至是服務上的支援。

Considering that bereaved families may have difficulty providing identification documents and medical records of the deceased, forensic pathologists will exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis and provide appropriate support. They will also endeavour to assist bereaved families in applying for a waiver of post-mortem procedures according to their wishes.

ããTo provide immediate relief for affected residents, the Government began offering an emergency cash subsidy of HK$10,000 per affected household last night. Applications were processed for 78 households last night, with HK$780,000 disbursed. As at 4pm today, the Tai Po District Office is processing applications from over 1 200 households, and the emergency cash subsidies will be disbursed over today and tomorrow. In addition, the Government will provide a token of solidarity of HK$200,000 to the family members of each deceased victim, and starting next week, a living allowance of HK$50,000 will be provided to each affected household.

ããThe Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will arrange dedicated staff to assist each family of the deceased in handling funeral arrangements, including body claims, cremation services, and applications for niche allocations. The FEHD will also maintain close co-ordination with social workers under the Social Welfare Department (SWD)'s ""one social worker per household"" initiative. The FEHD will provide extra cremation sessions and make available niches at public columbaria under the Department, enabling families to arrange cremations and post-funeral matters promptly at their preferred time and location. The Government will waive fees for cremation services and niches at public columbaria, bear funeral expenditures, and provide $50,000 to the families of each deceased individual.

 On replacements of identity documents, residents affected by the fire may visit the Immigration Headquarters during office hours without an appointment for replacements of Hong Kong identity cards or HKSAR travel documents, any Registration of Persons Office for replacements of identity cards, and any Immigration Branch Office for replacements of travel documents. Meanwhile, the Immigration Department has deployed officers to various temporary shelters to assist the affected residents of Wang Fuk Court with pre-registration and will arrange dedicated vehicles to take them to the Immigration Headquarters in Tseung Kwan O later to complete the procedures for replacements of personal documents, including Hong Kong identity cards and HKSAR travel documents (such as the HKSAR passport, the Document of Identity for Visa Purposes, and the Re-entry Permit) and the Hong Kong Birth Certificate. Relevant fees will be waived. A special service session will be arranged at the Immigration Headquarters in Tseung Kwan O outside office hours tomorrow (November 29, Saturday) to process relevant applications.

 For the Hong Kong and Macao Residents Entry and Exit Permit (Home Return Permit), the Immigration Department has liaised with the China Travel Service (Holdings) Hong Kong Limited to provide a special service period to assist residents in need to apply for Home Return Permits and other travel documents issued by Mainland authorities at the adjacent China Travel Service Document Services HK Limited Tseung Kwan O Centre, after completing their relevant applications at the Immigration Headquarters.
ãã
ãã In addition, the Government is striving to provide emergency accommodation support for residents affected by the fire. As of this morning, around 205 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels/camps or hotel rooms. Another 601 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau. Furthermore, nine shelters remain open, with around 720 residents staying overnight yesterday. An interdepartmental support station is set up at each shelter, and Care Teams across all 18 districts will take turns to be on duty to assist residents.

ããTo accommodate the needs of residents admitted into Lok Sin Village and Good House, two transitional housing projects in Tai Po, the Transport Department (TD) has co-ordinated with KMB to enhance the service of route Nos. 72C, 73P, 74E, 75K, 75P and 275R travelling Ting Kok Road, as well as relevant operators to strengthen the service of the New Territories Green Minibus (GMB) route Nos. 20B, 20C, 20E, 20G, 20R and 20T. Starting from November 29, the GMB operator concerned will provide additional temporary service connecting Good House and MTR Tai Po Market Station.

 Regarding Trackside Villas, another transitional housing project in Tai Po, the TD is working with the relevant operator and stakeholder to follow up and further enhance services to Tai Po Market Station. The TD will continue to maintain close liaison with operating organisations of transitional housing projects concerned to cater for residents' needs.

ããWith the support from the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL), the Government will provide the affected residents with Octopus cards with $2,000 of stored credit through the SWD, with each resident receiving one card to facilitate their daily travel. The MTRCL has also set up a support desk at the MTR Tai Po Market Station to facilitate express registration for residents whose JoyYou Card, Octopus cards for persons with disabilities, and Octopus cards for students that have been lost or damaged.

ããSeparately, the Financial Secretary convened a co-ordination meeting this afternoon with financial regulators to enhance support for residents affected by the fire . The Insurance Authority has set up a dedicated task force to co-ordinate the insurance sector's responses on the handling of public enquiries and claims. Insurers are also offering various forms of assistance, including prioritising claims processing, expediting payouts, offering premium holidays or extended payment deadlines, and providing interest relief on policy loans.

 On other emergency support, the SWD has registered more than 900 households for the provision of ""one social worker per household"" services in order to render necessary assistance according to their welfare needs. The SWD will continue to reach out to other unregistered households, or they may leave their contact information by calling 182 183; social workers will assist to follow up. In addition, the SWD has arranged respite services for dozens of elderly residents and persons with disabilities. Social welfare organisations were also engaged to provide burial services for residents in need.

 Meanwhile, the Civil Service Bureau today mobilised more than 200 additional staff to form Quick Response Units to provide support at temporary shelters and other locations in Tai Po, including distributing supplies to affected residents. They include civil servants from the Civil Engineering and Development Department and the Immigration Department, as well as staff from the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

 To support schools and students to cope with the incident, the Education Bureau (EDB) will offer $100,000 to each primary and secondary school (including special schools) and $50,000 to each kindergarten in Tai Po District under the Special Incident Assistance Grant. If any school premises are damaged, the EDB will arrange emergency repair works. In addition, the EDB will hold five online seminars on psychological support this coming weekend to assist school personnel and parents in taking care of students or children with traumatic experiences.

Regarding fundraising and relief supplies, members of the public can visit 122 post offices across the territory (including three mobile post offices) to donate to the government-established Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. A receipt will be issued upon completion as confirmation. To further facilitate the public, the Faster Payment System (FPS) channel for the relief fund has been activated (FPS Identifier: 124037276). In addition, the Government is working with the information technology sector to expedite the development of an online platform for registering donated supplies, to allow organisations and members of the public to register the items they can donate, enabling the Government to better consolidate the information and distribute the supplies to residents in need when necessary. Members of the public may provide their contact information and details of items they can donate via WhatsApp at 9213 2388 for timely follow-up by the Government.

 The Government has established a dedicated website Support Services for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po (www.taipofire.gov.hk), providing a one-stop platform for relevant information and updates on accommodation support, relief supplies, government dedicated fund, financial support, as well as medical and counselling services, to facilitate public access.
ãã
ããRegarding the investigations and regulation, the three personnel of the construction company arrested yesterday are still being detained for enquiries. The Fire Services Department has established an interdepartmental investigation team with participating departments including the Hong Kong Police Force, the Buildings Department, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, the Housing Department, the Labour Department, and the Government Laboratory. The investigation will commence shortly.

 On the protective nets used at Wang Fuk Court, the contractor submitted a test report to the Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau (ICU) in October 2024. Upon review, the ICU did not identify any non-compliance issues against the fire-retardant requirements as stipulated in the Buildings Ordinance and relevant practice notes/circular letters. In addition, officers of the ICU visited Wang Fuk Court in November 2024 to oversee how the registered inspectors and contractor conducted on-site sampling and burned the material of the protective nets, but no combustible feature was detected. In light of the fire incident and to conduct sampling and testing at the work sites, the ICU conducted preliminary on-site sampling of the protective nets yesterday at five Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) courts that have been issued notices under the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme and are currently undergoing major maintenance works (apart from Wang Chi House of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, others include Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin, Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, and On Kay Court in Kwun Tong). The preliminary results of the tests conducted by the Government Laboratory have not identified any non-compliance issues against the fire-retardant requirements of protective nets as stipulated in the Buildings Ordinance and relevant practice notes/circular letters.

The ICU has also conducted on-site sampling of the styrofoam materials used for protecting the windows at Wang Chi House of Wang Fuk Court, which was not affected by the fire incident. Tests by the Government Laboratory confirmed that the styrofoam material is flammable. Except for Wang Fuk Court, the ICU has not identified any cases of using styrofoam boards as the protective materials for the external walls or windows at the other four HOS courts. The ICU will continue to conduct on-site sampling at the seven buildings affected by the fire incident in Wang Fuk Court. Immediate referral will be made to the law enforcement agencies for prosecutions if any non-compliance issues are found.

 The Buildings Department (BD) commenced inspections yesterday in batches of existing buildings that are undergoing major external wall repairs and with scaffold nets installed for checking of records or relevant test documents regarding the fire-retardant properties of materials such as scaffold nets; and collecting samples for testing. As of 5pm today, the BD inspected 127 buildings and collected samples, which are sent in batches to the Government Laboratory, local private laboratories, and Mainland laboratories for testing. Results are expected within one to three days. The BD aims to complete inspections and sampling in batches within next week at the latest. In the inspections conducted so far, the BD has discovered two buildings with foam boards covering windows and has requested their immediate removal. The BD will notify residents by letter and seek legal advice for considering legal penalties.

 The BD has issued circular letters to all registered building professionals and registered contractors, requiring them to review records or test documents for materials such as scaffold nets for ongoing works, regardless of whether the projects are new building constructions or maintenance of existing buildings. The review includes checking whether the materials are in good condition and meeting fire-retardant performance standards and requirements. Reports must be submitted to the BD within seven days, and the BD will immediately conduct audit checks for sampling and testing. The Architectural Services Department (ArchSD) has also requested the contractors of 24 public works building projects to review the records or test documents of materials, such as scaffold protective nets. A report must be submitted to the ArchSD within seven days."

Pest Control Steering Committee reviews progress of preventive work against chikungunya fever and efforts in rodent control implemented by departments (with photo),2025-11-28 22:48,2025-11-28 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800802.htm,"The interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee (PCSC) held its 21st meeting today (November 28) to review the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF) and coping measures. The PCSC also examined measures of departments on rodent prevention and discussed the use of Rodent Absence Rate (RAR) to help departments implement targeted measures to tackle rodent black spots.

Prevention and control of CF

Representative from the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) presented the latest local, Guangdong Province and global surveillance data and risk assessment. The representative of the CHP also reported the results of epidemiological investigation into several cases recently recorded among residents of Tsing Yi, which revealed that the patients’ activities during the incubation and infectious periods overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily around Tsing Yi town centre and the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. As some patients of the confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be an area with higher risk. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have hiked in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area since November 1 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary.

In response to the cases recorded in Tsing Yi, follow-up actions have been taken by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), which include:


Upon receiving the CHP's notification, surveys of mosquito infestation will be initiated within 24 hours in areas within a 250-metre radius of the residence and workplace of the patient, as well as places the patient had visited during the incubation and infectious period. Relevant Government departments will be notified with the results for follow-up actions;
Implementing larvicidal control measures in the target area and conducting fogging operations in nearby adult mosquito habitats to eliminate adult mosquitoes;
Providing professional advice and technical support to relevant departments and stakeholders to assist in swiftly formulating and implementing effective mosquito control measures;
Inspecting construction sites and private residences, and taking enforcement actions against violations related to mosquito breeding;
Visiting schools and childcare facilities in the target area to provide information and assistance regarding mosquito prevention; and
Enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails to eliminate adult mosquitoes since November 13. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dogs are being trialed to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. Pamphlets have been also distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations.

The FEHD has earlier requested the Kwai Tsing District Office, the District Lands Office of Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing, and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trail.

The District Environmental Hygiene Superintendent (Kwai Tsing) of the FEHD also held a meeting of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts today, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to coordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

In addition, in terms of the overall risk assessment, although the northern hemisphere is about to enter winter, some subtropical regions are still experiencing higher-than-normal temperatures due to climate change, creating suitable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, the outbreaks of CF in tropical regions are ongoing. Therefore, the risk of imported cases persists.

Representatives from the FEHD reported to the PCSC the latest situation of mosquito proliferation. The gravidtrap indices for Aedes albopictus for October 2025 was 2.2 per cent, lower than the 2.5 per cent recorded in September. In October, all 64 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index lower than the alert level of 20 per cent. In addition, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in October was 1.2, which represented that an average of 1.2 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas.

Aedes albopictus eggs are resilient in cold and dry conditions, and upon exposure to suitable temperature and water, the eggs could still hatch into adult mosquitoes. To prevent the local transmission of CF, all government departments and the community must continue to maintain effective mosquito prevention and control measures in place during the winter season, ensuring the removal of potential breeding grounds and thorough clearance of mosquito eggs. In view of the situation at the Tsing Yi Nature Trail, relevant departments will also remind their staff to pay special attention to mosquito control efforts along hiking trails and similar areas.

Rodent control

The FEHD presented the results of its rodent activity surveys conducted in various districts during the first half of 2025. The findings indicated that the overall RAR was 96 per cent. Compared to the RAR recorded in the second half of 2024, 16 out of the 19 surveyed districts (approximately 84 per cent) showed an increase in their RAR, reflecting an improvement in rodent conditions.

In the meeting, the FEHD introduced how to effectively utilize the RAR data to formulate more targeted measures, further enhancing the effectiveness of rodent control efforts. In addition, the FEHD continues to carry out strategic rodent control actions in 93 major rodent black spots, reallocating resources to comprehensively and continuously mitigate the rodent infestation in the relevant black spots. It is estimated that the target of reducing the number of hotspots by 60 per cent can be achieved by the end of 2025.

In addition, the Housing Department (HD) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) also reported in the meeting rodent prevention and control measures implemented in venues and areas under their purview.

In the meeting, the LCSD reported the latest rodent situation in San Po Kong Sitting-out Area. With the support from the FEHD, the LCSD will continue to implement rodent prevention and control measures. To date, a total of 23 rodents have been caught or found dead at the site. In addition, the LCSD is preparing enforcement actions against feeding of rodents and related acts that soil public areas in collaboration with other departments. Furthermore, the FEHD will shortly install thermal imaging cameras at the location to monitor rodent activity and assess the effectiveness of control measures. The site will also be included in the Rodent Activity Survey for 2026, in accordance with established criteria and priorities.

The effectiveness of prevention and control of rodents relies on the co-operation of stakeholders from various sectors. The Environment and Ecology Bureau will continue to co-ordinate the Cross-sectoral Territory-wide Anti-rodent Action to promote cross-sector, multidisciplinary and community involvement to comprehensively control rodent together. The FEHD launched the first phase of the Anti-rodent Charter (the Charter) targeting residential premises in December 31, 2024, to promote residents' awareness of environmental hygiene and encourage them to cultivate good habits for a rodent-free environment. As of November 25, 2025, 684 residential premises have signed the Charter, covering around 650 000 households. Among the residential premises, two are participants of the Pilot Scheme on Joint Property Management, covering more than 40 households. Other participants of the Pilot Scheme on Joint Property Management will be invited to sign the Charter when they are ready.

The Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology and the Chairperson of the PCSC, Miss Diane Wong, urged at the meeting all departments to closely monitor situation of mosquito proliferation in areas identified as high risk, and strengthen mosquito elimination work in areas under their purviews. Regarding rodent infestation, Miss Wong emphasised interdepartmental collaboration and public participation are important to combating rodent infestation. Various departments should proactively consolidate the rodent control work with various sectors and encourage the public to collaborate in rodent prevention and control actions.

The meeting today was chaired by Miss Diane Wong. Government bureaux, departments and organisations attending the meeting were the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department; the Architectural Services Department; the Civil Engineering and Development Department; the Development Bureau; the Department of Health; the Drainage Services Department; the Education Bureau; the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department; the Environmental Protection Department; the FEHD; the Government Property Agency; the Hospital Authority; the Home Affairs Department; the HD; the Highways Department; the Lands Department; the LCSD; the Marine Department; and the Water Supplies Department."

大埔火災後續支援工作持續推進,2025-11-28 22:00,2025-11-28 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800851.htm,"政府發言人今日（十一月二十八日）表示，大埔宏福苑的滅火及救援工作已完成，多個政策局及部門現正集中持續加強後續支援善後工作。政府已於昨日（十一月二十七日）成立調查及規管工作組、緊急支援及募捐工作組，以及應急住宿安排工作組，分別由政務司司長、政務司副司長和財政司副司長領導，積極推展相關工作。

為加快處理有關失蹤者的查詢，警方已啓用「重大事件調查及災難支援系統」（MIIDSS – 超級電腦）識別傷亡人士身分，並將調動「災難遇害者辨認組」，有系統地辨認遇害者身分，並為後續調查及善後工作提供證據。警方亦已設立辨認處，協助家屬透過相片初步辨認遺體，在完成初步辨認後，警方會安排正式的遺體辨認程序。

大埔火災逝者遺體會按照《死因裁判官條例》（第504章）移送公眾殮房。衞生署法醫服務正為警方災難遇害者辨認組搜集證據，全力協助辨認逝者身分。考慮到火災逝者親屬可能難以提供逝者的身份證明文件和醫療記錄，法醫會因應每宗個案酌情處理和提供適切支援，並按親屬意願盡力協助申請豁免遺體剖驗程序。

為解受影響居民燃眉之急，政府昨晚起向每戶受影響居民提供一萬元現金的應急補助金，昨晚已為78戶受影響居民處理申請，發放了78萬元應急補助金。截至今日下午四時，大埔民政事務處正為超過1 200戶居民處理申請，並會於今明兩日發放應急補助金。此外，政府亦會為每位死難者的家屬發放20萬元慰問金，並由下星期開始，為每一戶家庭發放五萬元生活津貼。

食物環境衞生署會安排專人協助每一個死難者家庭處理殮葬事宜，包括辦理遺體認領、火葬場服務及骨灰龕位編配等，並會與社會福利署（社署）「一戶一社工」的社工緊密聯繫。食物環境衞生署會增加額外火化時段，以及提供轄下多個公眾骨灰安置所的龕位，讓家屬可以盡快按其屬意的時段及地點安排火化及有關身後事。政府會免費提供火化服務及公眾骨灰安置所的龕位，並承擔殮葬開支，向每名死難者家屬提供五萬元。

補辦證件方面，受火災影響的居民可無需預約，於辦公時間前往：入境事務處（入境處）總部，辦理補發香港身份證或香港特別行政區旅行證件；各人事登記辦事處，辦理補發身份證；或各入境處分區辦事處，辦理補發旅行證件。入境處同時作出安排，派員到各個臨時庇護中心為受影響宏福苑居民預先登記，並安排居民稍後時間由專車接送到將軍澳入境處總部辦理個人證件補領手續，涵蓋香港身份證和香港特別行政區旅行證件（如特區護照、簽證身份書、回港證）、香港出生證明書等，有關費用將獲豁免。將軍澳入境處總部將設立特別服務時段，於明日（十一月二十九日）（星期六）的辦公時間以外時段辦理有關申請。

至於港澳居民來往內地通行證（回鄉證）方面，入境處已協調香港中國旅行社集團於特別服務時段，為有需要的居民在將軍澳入境處總部辦理證件申請後，前往毗鄰的香港中旅證件服務將軍澳中心，辦理回鄉證等由內地機關簽發的旅行證件。

此外，政府正盡力為受火災影響的居民提供應急住宿支援。截至今日上午，約205名居民已入住由民政及青年事務局協調的青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間；另有601名居民入住房屋局的過渡性房屋單位。此外，政府繼續開放九個庇護中心，昨晚共有約720多人通宵使用。各個庇護中心設有跨部門支援站，18區的地區服務及關愛隊伍會輪流於庇護中心當值協助居民。

為支援入住大埔「樂善村」和「善樓」兩個過渡性房屋項目災民的需要，運輸署已協調九巴加強途經汀角路的第72C、73P、74E、75K、75P和275R號線的服務，以及相關營辦商加強新界專線小巴第20B、20C、20E、20G、20R和20T號線的服務。此外，有關專線小巴營辦商由十一月二十九日起會增設臨時服務，接駁「善樓」與港鐵大埔墟站。

至於大埔區內另一過渡性房屋項目「策誠軒」，運輸署正與相關營辦商和持份者跟進進一步加強前往港鐵大埔墟站的服務。署方會繼續與相關過渡性房屋項目營運機構密切聯繫，照顧居民需要。

政府已獲香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）支持，向受火災影響居民捐出已備2,000元增值額的八達通卡，社署協助派發，每名居民可獲一張，以便利他們日常出行。港鐵公司亦已於港鐵大埔墟站設支援站，為遺失或損毁樂悠咭、殘疾人士八達通及學生八達通的居民，辦理特快補領登記。

另外，財政司司長今日下午召開金融監管機構統籌會議，商討加強對受大埔宏福苑火災影響居民的支援。保險業監管局亦已成立專責小組，協調保險業界處理客戶的查詢和理賠工作。各保險公司亦正以不同方式為受影響人士作出援助，例如在保單服務方面，會優先處理索賠申請、加快賠償程序、提供保費假期或延長保單繳款期限、提供保單貸款利息減免等。

其他應急支援工作方面，社署至今已為超過900戶居民登記，提供「一戶一社工」跟進服務，按其福利需要提供所需協助。社署會繼續尋找尚未登記的住戶，居民亦可致電182183提供聯絡資料，社工會跟進協助。同時，社署已為數十名長者及殘疾人士安排暫託服務，並已聯絡社會福利機構為有需要人士提供殯葬支援。

同時，公務員事務局今日動員逾200名額外人手組成應急隊，前往大埔臨時庇護中心等地點提供協助，包括向受影響居民派發物資。參與人員來自土木工程拓展署、入境事務處以及廉政公署。

為支援學校及學生應對這次事故，教育局將向大埔區每間中小學（包括特殊學校）和幼稚園分別發放十萬元和五萬元的「特別事故支援津貼」。如有校舍受損，教育局會安排緊急修葺工程。教育局並將於本周末舉辦五場網上心理支援講座，以支援學校人員和家長照顧有創傷經歷的學生或子女。

至於募捐及物資支援方面，市民也可於全港122間郵政局（包括三間流動郵政局），向政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」捐款，完成後會獲發收據作實。為方便市民，基金的「轉數快」渠道亦已開通（快速支付系統識別碼 : 124037276）。此外，政府正與資訊科技業界加快建立物資捐獻網上平台，方便團體及市民登記可捐贈物資，以便統一整合並在有需要時分發予居民。市民也可透過WhatsApp號碼9213 2388提供其聯絡資料及可捐獻物資，以便政府適時跟進。

政府已設立「大埔宏福苑支援服務」專題網站（www.taipofire.gov.hk），一站式提供住宿支援、物資援助、政府專項基金、經濟援助，以及醫療與心理支援等相關資訊及最新消息，方便市民查閱。

在調查及規管工作方面，警方昨日拘捕的三名建築工程公司人士仍被扣留調查。消防處已成立跨部門調查專組，參與部門包括警務處、屋宇署、機電工程署、房屋署、勞工處及政府化驗所，相關調查工作即將展開。

就宏福苑棚網而言，承建商曾於二○二四年十月向房屋局獨立審查組（審查組）提供棚網測試報告。審查組經審視後並無發現不符合《建築物條例》及相關作業備考／通告函件對棚網阻燃特性的要求。審查組人員亦曾於二○二四年十一月到訪宏福苑，監察宏福苑負責註冊檢驗人員和承建商現場抽樣並用火燃點棚網物料，並未發現助燃情況。因應是次火災，為進行工程現場採樣測試的情況審查組已於昨日向轄下五個已發出強制性驗樓通知，並正在進行大維修的屋苑（除了大埔宏福苑宏志閣外，亦包括沙田穗禾苑、深水埗清麗苑、深水埗怡閣苑及觀塘安基苑）棚網進行初步現場採樣。經政府化驗所進行測試，初步結果並無發現不符合《建築物條例》及相關作業備考／通告函件對棚網阻燃特性的要求。

審查組亦已於未受火災波及的宏福苑宏志閣，就保護建築物窗戶的發泡膠物料進行現場採樣；經政府化驗所進行測試，結果為易燃。除宏福苑外，審查組在另外四個屋苑並未發現外牆及窗外附有發泡膠板保護物料。就宏福苑餘下七座受火災影響的樓宇，審查組會繼續進行現場採樣；如發現有任何違規情況，審查組會即時轉交執法部門進行檢控。

屋宇署昨日亦開始分批巡查正進行外牆大維修而有搭建棚架保護網的現存樓宇，以檢查棚架保護網等物料的阻燃性能的記錄或相關測試文件，並抽取樣本進行測試。截至今日下午五時，屋宇署已巡查127幢樓宇並抽取樣本，陸續將樣本送交政府化驗所、本地私人化驗所及內地化驗所測試。測試預期可於一至三日內取得結果。屋宇署會爭取最遲於下星期內分批完成巡查所有樓宇及抽取樣本的工作。至今的巡查行動中，屋宇署發現當中有兩幢樓宇有發泡膠板遮封窗戶，已要求立即移除。屋宇署亦會發信通知居民，並會就此徵詢法律意見考慮法律懲處。

此外，屋宇署已向所有註冊建築專業人士及註冊承建商發出通告函件，要求他們就正進行中的工程，無論是興建新樓或是現樓維修，覆核棚架保護網等物料的記錄或測試文件，包括狀況是否良好，是否符合阻燃性能的標準和要求，並且在七日內向部門提交報告；部門會隨即展開抽查個案抽取樣本進行測試。建築署亦已要求轄下所有24個工務工程樓宇項目的承建商覆核棚架保護網等物料的記錄或測試文件，並在七日內向署方提交報告。"

民政及青年事務局局長、勞工及福利局局長和教育局局長會見傳媒答問內容,2025-11-28 21:52,2025-11-28 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800805.htm,"​民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（十一月二十八日）聯同勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的答問內容：

記者：想先問有關民間捐款，不同企業都捐了很多錢，有居民表示不少要自行向機構申請，政府會否考慮將民間捐款整合？居民就不用走來走去，和更有效、針對性地使用捐款。第二，剛才都提到很多居民的需要，是否覺得全部掌握到？還是他們還有其他需要，但仍未覆蓋到，仍需要補充？

民政及青年務局局長：目前有許多民間捐款。正如我剛才所說，政府設立的基金自昨晚七時開始接受捐款至今，我們已收到五億元的民間捐款。我們都會善用這筆資源，包括我剛才提到的，我們將首先於下星期為每戶受影響的家庭發放五萬元的生活津貼。請各位住戶盡快聯絡「一戶一社工」協助登記。

我們也會為每位不幸過身死者的家屬提供20萬元的慰問金。我們也會按每個住戶的需要，提供包括在住宿或日常生活方面的需求，由此基金中提供支援。我們也會持續透過這個基金，不斷提出新的措施，為居民提供協助。

我們不斷希望大家盡快接觸社工，就是因為我們希望能夠掌握每一位街坊所面對的問題，以及他們需要的幫助，使我們能夠透過基金提供適切的協助。我們剛才探訪過的一些住戶，大家可能都沒想到，他逃生時甚至連眼鏡都沒有帶走。這些情況大家可能都未曾預料。在他剛才反映後，我們便會立即安排。我們希望透過接觸居民，知道他們的需求。我們一定會想方設法，無論是透過這個基金的支援，或是借助民間的力量與幫助，政府必定會統籌各方，在支援和幫助受影響家庭的工作上全力以赴。

記者：我想問問局長，政府開立不同的資助，一萬、五萬、20萬都有。有沒有承諾多少日內可以派錢？一萬元的援助金還有多少戶未登記呢？1 800戶其實有多少人呢？為甚麼部分今日登記了的災民不能即日領錢？臨時屋的轉介率、入住率是多少？有沒有一個日子是將所有臨時庇護中心的居民都轉移至青年宿舍或酒店呢？

民政及青年務局局長：我們在昨天探訪一些住戶後，了解到他們當時匆忙逃生，連錢包都沒有帶，所以最迫切的是為他們提供應急錢傍身。因此，昨天行政長官已宣布，我們將提供一萬元的應急錢。我們希望以現金形式發放給他們，因為如果給他們支票，他們也無法使用。在這方面，由於需要點算和籌集現金，我們透過銀行協助，因此需要一些時間。今天我們也請銀行幫忙準備現金，希望能在這一兩天內，只要住戶完成登記，我們便立即發放。這當然是越快越好。

正如我剛才所說，我們會根據居民的需要，不斷提出新的措施，希望能幫助他們。其中之一就是我剛才提到的，我們將於下星期透過「一戶一社工」的登記，向每戶發放五萬元的生活津貼。我們之所以需要社工協助登記，是因為金額較大，我們認為不宜使用現金發放。我們希望透過社工協助登記，以盡快發放這五萬元的生活津貼。這也是越快越好，我們希望下星期能夠做到，當然也要視乎登記的進度。昨天登記的人數還算不多，但今天登記領取應急錢的人已增加了許多。

至於我們為死者家屬提供的二十萬元慰問金，我們同樣會透過社工盡快與家屬安排。

關於庇護中心的情況，我們和大家一樣，最關心的是如何為目前身在庇護中心受影響居民提供一個較好的居所。因此，我們在這麼短的時間內，透過大家的幫助，迅速找到一千間房間，希望讓現在住在庇護中心的街坊有地方居住。正如我剛才所說，在房屋局和財政司副司長的領導下，已馬上安排在兩星期後，將有一千八百個過渡性房屋等單位可供長期居住。我們掌握到的數字，應該足以應付宏福苑內受影響住戶的數目。

我們和大家的目標一致，希望盡快幫助他們先找到一個好一點的地方，無論是酒店或是青年宿舍也好。因此，我們在昨晚和今晚，都會陸續提供交通安排，接送住戶前往青年宿舍或酒店。不過，我們接觸到有一些住戶其實不太願意搬離庇護中心，因為他們認為庇護中心人較多，接收到的資訊會比較直接。但我可以告訴大家，請不用擔心，最重要的是，正如剛才孫局長提到的號碼182 183。無論你是到青年宿舍、酒店居住，或是與家人同住，無論你有任何需要，都可以撥打182 183，會有社工協助進行各項登記。而且，一旦你登記後，有社工與你聯絡，我們絕不會遺漏任何人。我們一定有社工負責聯絡大家，無論是關於資助計劃，或是住屋安排。這幾天天氣可能會越來越冷，我們都希望可盡快在這一兩天內，安排在庇護中心的街坊入住青年宿舍或酒店，也希望他們不用再擔心搬到酒店後會收不到資訊，因為我們的社工會持續跟進。

記者︰麥局長可否講講這次救災關愛隊的角色？有很多市民自發組成物資站。有些網上消息說可能關愛隊會接手，或會報警處理義工的問題。這些消息是否屬實呢？關愛隊人手和規模是否足夠去處理物資站呢？另外，亦想問孫局長，早前勞工處表示已向承建商發出改善通知書及進行檢控，但亦有保安員提到有建築工人用物件阻礙防火門、以及警報系統亦出現問題，處方於發出通知書後有否進行跟進？為何發出六張通知書後問題仍然存在？是否有官員需要問責？

民政及青年務局局長：關於關愛隊，大家都知道關愛隊其實都是義工。在第一天，我們已經動員了整個大埔區的300名關愛隊義工。同時跨區的沙田也提供了40名關愛隊隊員和義工，協助各個庇護中心的運作。因為第一天我們已開設八個庇護中心，加上在三個在醫院設立的支援站，所以當天我們需要大量人手。在很短時間內，我們動員了關愛隊數百人，包括大埔區的隊員以及區議員，一起協助庇護中心的工作。

這幾天，如果大家有看到我們在庇護中心的情況，就會發現現在當值的已經不只大埔區的關愛隊隊員，還有來自其他區的隊員，例如今天有來自荃灣區、沙田區等各區的關愛隊隊員和義工來到支援。關愛隊的隊員和義工當然要協助庇護中心內的工作，為受影響的市民提供幫助。他們也會與民政處的同事一起，為受影響的居民提供幫助。

至於物資方面，我剛才已多次提到，我們非常感激大家的熱心，捐贈了許多物資到各個庇護中心。但有些物資我們不一定有需要，或者有些物資的數量已經足夠。如果我們還要花時間整理過多的物資，反而會影響我們的首要工作。我們現在首要工作應該是幫助受影響的住戶，盡快讓他們至少能得到短期的住宿安置，以及協助他們申請所需的證件等。這就是為甚麼我們這幾天已經安排了接近1 300個單位，包括青年宿舍、青年驛站或酒店，並提供交通接駁，這些就是我們近期集中進行的工作。

因此，我希望這個時候大家應該不分彼此，在協助受影響居民的工作上分工合作。有些在幕後負責安排酒店、進行大量的登記工作，有些負責整理物資，有些負責分發物資，還有些負責安排交通，或者協助居民處理特別需要。大家齊心合力，分工合作為居民提供適切和及時的幫助。我認為這才是現在最重要的事。社會應該不分彼此、不分立場，一起幫助受影響的居民，每個人都願意在不同的崗位上出一分力。

記者：接手物資站和報警方面是否屬實？

民政及青年事務局局長：在一些庇護中心，情況確實比較混亂。一般來說，如果大家了解民政處的工作，就會知道我們相當保護庇護中心內的居民。我們一般不會讓工作人員以外的人士進入庇護中心，因為我們必須保護庇護中心內居民的安全和私隱。我舉一個具體的例子，昨晚我們發放一萬元應急錢時，在工作上確實遇到困難。因為以往庇護中心使用者，即服務的需要者。現在中心內有許多人。我們需要逐一詢問誰是宏福苑的居民，確認他們是否已完成登記，再協助他們辦理手續。因此，為甚麼我們在庇護中心內需要維持秩序，並保護中心使用者、各位居民的私隱和安全，這點是非常重要。所以我希望大家能夠明白，此時，我們真正應該以居民的福祉為首要考量，如何保護他們的安全和私隱。大家可以繼續關心他們，如果有物資捐贈，我希望大家能暫緩一下，因為現在物資已經相當充足，當他們將來搬遷至過渡性房屋時，可能會有其他物資需求，那時再捐贈或許對他們更為合適。因此，我希望大家能實際一點，我們要從實際出發去幫助居民。但我必須強調，我非常感謝社會各界眾志成城，在這個時刻如此團結地幫助受影響的居民。特區政府也與大家一樣，我們首要的工作重心都是幫助受影響的居民。

勞工及福利局局長：針對宏福苑的大廈維修工程自去年七月份開始，勞工處一共作出16次巡查，巡查的重點是與職安健有關，當中接到一些投訴。正如你剛剛所說，勞工處總共發出六張敦促改善通知書，並進行三宗檢控。檢控主要是針對高空工作，是有關職安健的。最後一次巡查是十一月二十日，針對防火對承建商作了書面提醒，敦促他們加強防火，因為我們接到投訴表示有工人吸煙。我們在防火方面對承建商作出了提醒。

關於剛剛麥局長提到的，我亦補充兩句，市民大眾都很想用自己的一點點力量幫助受影響的居民，其實大家如果等一等，可能會更加理想。隨着「一戶一社工」的展開，住戶會搬進青年宿舍、酒店或過渡性房屋，我們通過社工會更好掌握居民的需要。經過數天的思考，我覺得除了物質需要外，支援服務亦是他們需要的。日後我們會掌握得更多資訊，到時政府會向大家呼籲，請有相關專業能力、專業服務的人士一起出心出力幫助他們。因為究竟他們需要甚麼，是要與他們溝通後才知道。接下來的日子，他們會於生活上面對很多困難，我們要清楚掌握他們的需要，整理好再向大眾發出呼籲。譬如我們估計所需的應該不涉及物資，或許是與專業服務有關的。如果有關的專業人士可以幫助居民的話，我們一定會全力協調、安排好這方面的工作。多謝大家。"
​銀行業界推出六項應急支援措施 協助大埔火警受災居民渡過難關,2025-11-28 21:45,2025-11-28 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800774.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, chikungunya fever and dengue fever",2025-11-28 21:33,2025-11-28 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800800.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 28) reported the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

As of 5pm today,one new imported CF case has been recorded.

The case involves a 63-year-old male living in Kwai TsingDistrict. Initial investigation revealed that he visited Sanya in Hainan between November 9 and 14 and Shenzhen in Guangdong on November 19 respectively. He developed joint pain on November 25, followed by a fever and rash yesterday (November 27). He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital on the same day, and has been admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

The patient has two household contacts, which are also his travel collaterals to Sanya. One of his household contacts and six other persons travelled to Shenzhen with him. All of them are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 As the patient has travelled to the Chinese Mainland during the incubation period, the CHP preliminarily considered that he was infected during travel. This case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the health authority of the Chinese Mainland.

Among the recently recorded imported cases, five patients reside in Tsing Yi. The CHP has completed the genetic sequencing and genome analysis of the relevant patient samples, with results indicating that:


Two patients from the same household, namely a 60-year-old female (confirmed on November 21) and a 66-year-old male (confirmed on November 22), share identical genetic sequence, confirming that both patients share the same source of infection. However, this sequence differed from other local or imported cases. Since the two patients visited Shenzhen in Guangdong during their incubation period, the CHP considered this household cluster are imported cases;
Regarding the other two patients who did not know each other, including a 63-year-old male living in Broadview Garden (confirmed on November 20) and a 49-year-old female living in Tsing Yi Estate (confirmed on November 23), their viruses' genetic sequences are identical but differed from those of other local or imported CF cases (including the abovementioned family) and cases in the Guangdong Province with genome analysis conducted. The CHP's epidemiological investigation revealed that their activities during the incubation and infectious periods overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily around Tsing Yi town centre and the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The CHP cannot rule out the possibility that an earlier, undiagnosed imported case transmitted the virus to mosquitoes, which then infected them. Based on epidemiological investigation and genome analysis, the CHP now classified these two cases as locally acquired cases; and
For the remaining 53-year-old woman (confirmed on November 21), genome analysis cannot be conducted due to low viral load. Since the patient visited Zhongshan about two weeks prior to the onset of illness, the CHP classified her as an imported case.


For the recent imported and local cases residing in Tsing Yi, the CHP initiated immediate epidemiological investigations upon notification and notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the patients' activity locations for mosquito control operations. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have recently been in the vicinity of Tsing Yi North or hiking in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails since November 23 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP received enquiries from two individuals with mild symptoms and has arranged blood tests for them. One of the blood samples tested negative for the chikungunya virus. Laboratory testing for another individual is ongoing. The CHP has also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing. In view of the strengthened mosquito-borne disease control measures already implemented by the relevant government departments for all imported cases, and active case tracing was conducted in the district, the abovementioned two local cases have no substantial impacts on the current overall risk assessment.

Following the reclassification of the two abovementioned cases as local cases based on the genetic sequencing and analysis, among the 73 confirmed CF cases recorded in Hong Kong this year, six were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Dengue fever
----------------

 From November 21 to yesterday (November 27), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to Thailand during the incubation period.

 As of yesterday, 55 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

 DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 90 000 cases so far this year; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 3 449 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 110 cases were recorded in a week between November 10 and 16, with the highest number of cases recorded in Chaozhou, Shantou, Shenzhen, Huizhou and Foshan.

 Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

 The FEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

 Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


 âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

 The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Following are their remarks at the media session:

Reporter: Firstly, we just want to ask how would the government go about coordinating the hundreds of millions of dollars of physical donations and also monitoring the donation? How to distribute and also make best use of these donations and resources? And the second question, does the government have the latest information on the number and nationalities of domestic helpers that are missing, injured or dead as a result of this fire, and what will be done to support these domestic helpers, their employers and their families?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: As you see, the Government has already set up a Support Fund (Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po) to support the residents affected by this mega fire. We are consolidating the needs of various households to introduce different measures and schemes to help our affected residents. The first one being the $10,000 petty cash program which we launched yesterday. Till now, we have received and processed nearly 1,200 applications. Hopefully, we can distribute the money to the residents within these two days. This is the $10,000 petty cash to each affected household. Apart from that, we understand that each family will face different needs and difficulties during this incident. We are going to provide another $50,000 living allowance or subsidies to help each household. For this, we encourage all the affected households to register through the social workers of the Social Welfare Department. You can call 182 183 to reach social workers and give them your details and the social workers would process all these applications for you. For those unfortunately deceased, we will provide the families with $200,000 each, we hope to show our respect to the deceased and help the families in need in this difficult moment. All in all, we will screen and see all the needs and try to introduce more timely measures and schemes to help all those in need.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. For foreign domestic helpers, we understand that quite a number of helpers work in this estate, taking care mostly of the elderly people and also children and babies. The Labour Department together with the two consulates, namely the Indonesian Consulate and also the Consulate of the Philippines, arranged a visit to this site to help them identify and understand the situation of missing foreign domestic helpers in this court. So I provide you with the latest number provided to us by the two Consulates.

The Indonesian Consulate confirmed two deaths for Indonesian domestic helpers, one unverified death, two injured, and also 11 of them are missing. For the Filipino foreign domestic helpers, so far we have gathered information from the consulate is one unverified death, one injured, one is reported missing, and also there are altogether 32 in the process of locating them. We are working closely with the two Consulate Generals to help the foreign domestic helpers.

I think there are two major concerns with the foreign domestic helpers right now. One is about the living requirement. In their contract, they have to live in their reported residence. Right now, there is no way for them to get back. We are going to make special arrangements for them to make sure that they are still in compliance with the visa conditions of staying here in Hong Kong. The second is for those who died at the fire. There is already a standard provision in their contract so we will make sure that they will get all the necessary help, including getting their bodies back to either to Indonesia or back to the Philippines. Also, all the death compensation will be arranged in accordance with their standard contract for foreign domestic workers."

民政及青年事務局局長、勞工及福利局局長和教育局局長就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）,2025-11-28 21:20,2025-11-28 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800763.htm,"民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（十一月二十八日）聯同勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的開場發言：

民政及青年務局局長︰我們再一次代表特區政府向每一位死者的家屬表示深切慰問，亦希望傷者早日康復。特首非常關心每一個家庭，我們要掌握每一個家庭的需要，他吩咐我們要切實做好各樣支援每個家庭日後生活，尤其在這段艱難時候，每個政策局都要做好這方面工作，支援每一個受影響的家庭。

在我們的工作方面，有幾點要跟大家說。首先，繼昨日為每個受影響家庭發放一萬元應急錢，我要強調那個是應急錢，因為我們知道很多街坊當日走火警時，甚麼都沒有帶出來，知道他們很徬徨，所以我們馬上安排一萬元現金，讓他們有點錢傍身。正如我們昨日所說，我們仍會陸續為所有有需要家庭提供幫助，其中一個就是在今次火警中不幸過身的每一位死者的家屬，我們會向他們發放20萬元的慰問金，這是慰問金，當然之後可能還有其他津貼等，我們會透過社工幫他們申請。我們知道死者家屬在這段時間一定是很難過，尤其他們的家可能已被燒毀，所以特區政府會為每一個不幸過世死者的家屬提供20萬元的慰問金。

另外，大家對於去世家人的殯葬事宜很擔心，所以食環署（食物環境衞生署）會安排專人協助每一個死者的家庭處理殮葬事宜，包括領取火葬場的服務和骨灰龕位的編配，也會與社會福利署的「一戶一社工」緊密聯繫，食環署會增加額外的火化時段，提供轄下多個公眾骨灰安置所的龕位，讓家屬可以盡快按屬意時段和地點安排火化和其他身後事。政府亦會免費提供火化服務和公眾骨灰安置所的龕位，以及承擔有關的殯儀開支。

剛才提及我們在這一兩日陸續發放了一萬元應急錢，但現時大家在這段短時間需要些生活津貼，所以下星期開始，我們會向每一個家庭提供五萬元的生活津貼，我們會透過「一戶一社工」登記發放，稍後孫局長會講解「一戶一社工」。我們知道現時有些家庭未聯絡社工，或者他們搬了，不在庇護中心，可能跟他們家人或親戚住，所以他們可能不在庇護中心，未聯絡社工，稍後孫局長也會講解方法，怎樣可以聯絡社工進行登記，希望下星期這五萬元的生活津貼可幫助大家。

至於大家關心一萬元應急錢的發放情況，我們知道大家跑出來時，沒有錢在身邊，所以這一萬元我們盡量給大家現金。昨日我們已處理78戶申請和發放現金。截至今日下午四時，大埔民政事務處已為超過1 200戶登記，在今明兩日，我們會陸續發放應急錢。

特首昨日宣布成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，政府會投入三億元作起動資金，截至今日下午五時，在政府的三億元之外，我們已收到五億元捐款。即是說，除了政府的三億元外，我們再收到五億元來自各界的捐款。現在這個基金約有八億元。

我非常多謝社會各界的愛心和關心。在這個時候，正正需要大家一起發揮團結精神，為受影響的家庭和住戶提供適切的幫助。這個基金得到大家響應。我們也得到中銀（香港）的支持和幫忙，昨晚他們已經通宵安排了轉數快的渠道，方便大家捐款。很多朋友也問捐款的內容，包括是否可以作為慈善扣稅等，這些我們都會處理。不過請大家理解，現在我們必須做好的，一定是前線救援工作，以及支持受影響家庭的工作。關於所有收據發放等，請大家保留在銀行「入數」的收據，稍後我們會通知大家，如何發放收據以用作扣稅等。我們也知道大家想我們提供更多的渠道，包括AliPay或WeChat Pay等，我們稍後也會告知大家其他捐款渠道。

另外就是住宿的問題。住宿的問題都是大家非常關心的。在這幾天，截至昨晚，有720人使用九個庇護中心。在庇護中心裏，現時有足夠物資，包括社會福利署會提供熱食和其他物資的支援。正如我昨天所說，我們真的很感謝大家，在這幾天不斷地到不同庇護中心送物資，但是現在，若果大家有來過庇護中心就會看到，物資其實是足夠的。稍後民政事務總署會推出一個平台，我們現在已有一個WhatsApp號碼，稍後亦會透過一些科技界朋友創立一個平台，希望透過這平台，大家如果仍然想捐物資，就先在平台登記。因為稍後我們幫住戶作長遠一點的住宿安排時，他可能會需要其他更多的物資或配對，所以大家可否將現在打算捐的一些物資稍為保留，稍後當這些住戶搬到一個比較長期的住宿時，我們再將這些物資作配對和安排。

至於住宿方面，在這幾天這麼短的時間，我們馬上開放了九個庇護中心，但是我們明白大家在庇護中心住不是很方便，所以我們現在已經找了1 000間房間，包括青年宿舍和一些酒店業界提供的房間。我必須要說，所有這些住宿都是不需要收費，都是免費的。現時網上有一些流傳，聲稱要收費，又聲稱很貴，但是全部都是不屬實的。我們提供的住宿，還有我們提供的一切支援，都是不收取任何費用。不單止是現在這短期的住宿，日前財政司副司長提及的，在兩個星期後會在各區找到1 800個過渡性房屋等單位，都是不需要收費的，是為有需要家庭提供一個中長期的住宿安排，我們希望大家明白。有些住戶及家庭問怎樣可以知道有哪些過渡房屋可以選擇等，稍後孫局長會講解和社工聯絡的方法，請大家聯絡「一戶一社工」，有社工協助大家安排和申請不同的過渡房屋，無論是現時短期的住宿，在酒店或青年宿舍暫住，或在兩星期後提供的過渡房屋，都希望大家可以透過社工申請，我們會盡快安排。

昨日開始，我們已安排了幾百個住戶去酒店暫住，也有一些在青年宿舍暫住。這些住宿不但不收費，如果由大埔去到青年宿舍，譬如啟德青年驛站的交通都是免費安排。另外，大家也知道有一些機構，包括港鐵，他們會提供已經儲值2,000元的八達通給居民使用。另外，其他政府部門的服務，包括補領身份證，甚至回鄉證等，還有不同銀行或保險，他們都會提供一些特別安排給受影響家庭，這些都不需要大家去躊躇，不同的機構都有提供不同資源，大家不用去徬徨要去哪裏找資源。稍後孫局長會提供方法如何找到社工，找到社工就可以告訴大家怎樣可以得到所有服務，不需要大家東奔西走。

我想說的大概是這樣，我要再次多謝大家熱心幫助，但在這個時候，在網上或坊間也有很多不實的傳言，希望大家可以掌握正確的信息。因為如果這些不實的傳言傳出去，包括住宿要收費等，其實會影響了有需要的家庭去接受服務。這個說法會嚇跑人，他以為要收錢，就不去找社工幫忙，這是無助此事。希望大家可以掌握正確信息，也請大家幫忙將正確信息去告訴受影響居民，並透過我們的渠道，讓社工處理一站式的各項申請，讓受影響家庭能夠得到適切幫助。我交給孫局長。

勞工及福利局局長：各位傳媒朋友，現在於臨時庇護中心和富山公眾殮房都有社工和臨床心理學家24小時駐守，尤其是在認屍的過程中，我們的社工都會全程陪伴家屬，陪伴他們到殮房渡過這個十分艱難的時刻。

剛剛麥局長提及「一戶一社工」，截至目前為止，社會福利署（社署）已幫助930戶進行登記，即是說已接觸了約一半的住戶，還有一半的住戶未進行登記，我們預計明天和後天應該陸續有住戶會回來臨時庇護中心，到時我們會為他們登記。可能有些住戶已經去了親戚或朋友家裏暫住，但他們不需要擔心，因為他們可以留下聯絡方法。我們已經安排好，大家只需要致電182 183 留下聯絡方法，社工會回覆跟進。182 183原本是照顧者的支援專線，現在我們擴充它的功能，182 183的好處是24小時運作，而且有30條線，一定有人接聽。在這裏我呼籲仍然未接觸社署社工的受影響住戶，請你們致電182 183留下聯絡方法，讓社工可以找到你。

「一戶一社工」最終的目的是甚麼呢？我們預計在接下來的歲月，每一個住戶都會有不同的社福支援需要，過了一段時間後，他們要進行哀傷管理，亦有很多情緒支援的需要。通過與他們專屬配對的社工，可以進行轉介，並提供專業服務協助。

另外，社福界正提供各類型的支援服務，不需要居民自己到處尋找。我們希望可以通過社工幫助他們轉介、聯絡。大家都有留意，無論是政府、剛剛麥局長提到應急錢的援助，或者社福界其他有心人士，都會陸陸續續提供不同類型的現金支援或緊急援助。如果大家已進行登記，對於發放和確認身分是有幫助。所以希望大家可以盡快打182 183 聯絡我們，就可以用好「一戶一社工」，為接下來處理大家面對的困難提供更好的支援和服務。

此外，過去數天社署社工已轉介了數十位老人家、殘疾人士，提供了暫託的服務，希望他們盡快可以有地方得到適切的支援和照顧。今日我於社福方面的簡報到此為止。

教育局局長：各位傳媒朋友，就五級火警，造成的傷亡，我們非常痛心難過。在此向受影響家庭及學生致以慰問，希望傷者早日康復。

事故發生至今，我們一直與大埔區學校校長會和宏福苑附近的學校的校長們一直保持聯繫，並即時派出大埔區學校發展組和教育心理學家到庇護中心，幫助和輔導有情緒支援需要的同學。

同時，為支援這次重大事故，我們將向大埔區每間中小學包括特殊學校，和幼稚園分別發放十萬元和五萬元的「特別事故支援津貼」。學校可以靈活運用，為同學、教師和家長提供適切支援，包括：為師生家長提供哀傷輔導及情緒支援服務、舉辦講座及活動，為受影響同學提供一切所需教育支援，包括購買與學習相關的物品等。

在這段艱難時刻，我呼籲學校特別留意同學的情況、情緒和需要，盡量關心和陪伴他們。教育局將於明日（十一月二十九日）及後日（十一月三十日）兩日舉辦專業講座，就着如何為特別事故提供心理支援向教師和家長分享，讓他們學會幫助有需要的學生和子女。

我們知道走出傷痛需要時間和方法，因此我們亦開發了資源套，幫助學校和老師設計一些適切的教學材料去幫助同學。我們知道有些老師的情緒因同學家庭、學生或同事在這件事受影響，需要我們的支援。我們特別聯絡了「教師陽光專線」的輔導員加強服務，為教師提供輔導支援，聆聽及支援教師。

我們明白大家需要一些時間一起去渡過這件事情。我們亦與大埔區校長會組成危機處理小組。教育局會與校長會緊密聯繫，密切留意，包括停課、復課、學校資源、校舍情況、同學各種需要，我們會與校長們保持緊密聯繫，為學校提供適切支援。

我在此再一次對救護人員、消防員和在事故無私伸出援手的每一個人表達謝意，亦很感謝校長老師在這些時刻堅守崗位。"
​兩名入境旅客管有及進口未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-11-28 21:14,2025-11-28 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800749.htm,"兩名入境旅客分別因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，及進口應課稅品條例適用的貨品，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（十一月二十八日）在粉嶺裁判法院分別被判處監禁兩個月及罰款一千五百元，和監禁八星期及罰款二千元。

海關人員於十月六日在落馬洲支線管制站截查一名五十一歲抵港男旅客。海關人員在該名男旅客身上檢獲二千三百九十九支未完稅香煙，估計市值約一萬元，應課稅值約八千元。該名男旅客被判處監禁兩個月及罰款一千五百元。

另外，海關人員於十一月二十五日在同一管制站截查一名三十二歲抵港女旅客及其同行幼童，並發現該名女旅客利用幼童攜帶的背包收藏一千四百支未完稅香煙，估計市值約五千七百元，應課稅值約四千六百元。該名女旅客被判監禁八星期及罰款二千元。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，反映即使旅客屬初犯，亦可能被判處監禁，刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for possession and importation of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-11-28 21:14,2025-11-28 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800754.htm,"Two incoming passengers were respectively sentenced to two months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,500, and eight weeks' imprisonment with a fine of $2,000 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (November 28) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, and importing goods to which the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) applies, in contravention of the DCO.

Customs officers intercepted a 51-year-old incoming male passenger on October 6 at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point. Customs officers seized 2 399 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $10,000 and a duty potential of about $8,000, found on him. The male passenger was sentenced to two months' imprisonment and fined $1,500.

In addition, Customs officers intercepted a 32-year-old incoming female passenger and her accompanying child on November 25 at the same control point. Officers discovered that the woman had concealed 1 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $5,700 and a duty potential of about $4,600, in the backpack carried by the child. The female passenger was sentenced to eight weeks' imprisonment and fined $2,000.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

防治蟲鼠督導委員會檢視各部門防控基孔肯雅熱和滅鼠工作（附圖）,2025-11-28 20:50,2025-11-28 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800759.htm,"政府跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會今日（十一月二十八日）召開第二十一次會議，檢視基孔肯雅熱的最新情況和應對工作，以及各部門防治鼠患的措施，並討論如何善用「無鼠百分比」數據，以助部門採取針對性措施處理鼠患黑點。

防控基孔肯雅熱

衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）代表向各與會者講述本港、廣東省及全球基孔肯雅熱的最新監測數據及風險評估。中心代表亦匯報就近日錄得多宗在青衣居住的個案進行的流行病學調查結果，發現患者在潛伏期及發病後在青衣北活動的範圍有重疊，主要包括青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近。由於部分居於青衣的確診個案報稱，在青衣自然徑行山期間曾被蚊叮咬，中心認為青衣自然徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，盡快求醫，並致電中心的查詢熱線（2125 2373）。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）因應青衣的個案所採取的跟進行動包括：

在接獲中心的通報後，於二十四小時內啟動對確診患者住所、工作地點及於傳染期到過地方的250米半徑範圍內進行蚊患調查，並把調查結果通知相關政府部門，以便作出跟進行動；
於目標範圍一帶進行殺滅幼蟲的防控工作，亦會於附近的成蚊棲息地進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊；
為相關部門及持份者提供專業意見和技術支援，協助迅速制訂和實施有效的防蚊滅蚊措施；
巡查建築工地及私人住宅，對發現蚊子滋生的違規情況採取執法行動；
到訪目標範圍內的學校和幼兒設施，提供防蚊滅蚊資訊及協助；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張。


特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署自十一月十三日起已於該處各條行山徑持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，並在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。食環署亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑，以及向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患。

食環署早前已要求葵青民政事務處、荃灣葵青地政處及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強其範疇的行動，務求清除潛在蚊子滋生地。

食環署葵青區環境衞生總監今日（十一月二十八日）亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

另外，整體風險評估方面，雖然北半球即將進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，部分亞熱帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上在熱帶地區基孔肯雅熱持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在。

食環署代表向委員會匯報最新的蚊患情況。二○二五年十月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之二點二，較九月份的百分之二點五為低。十月份，全部64個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平。另外，十月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點二，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一點二隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。

白紋伊蚊蚊卵有耐寒耐旱的特性及經數月後在遇到合適的溫度及水體仍可孵化為成蚊。為遏止基孔肯雅熱在本地傳播，各政府部門及社會各界在冬季仍須繼續確保防蚊控蚊工作到位，清除潛在蚊子滋生地及徹底清除蚊卵。有見及青衣自然徑的情況，有關部門亦會提醒其負責的同事，特別留意行山徑等地方的防治蚊患工作。

防治鼠患

食環署向委員會匯報二○二五年上半年各分區的鼠隻活動調查結果。結果顯示，全港整體「無鼠百分比」為96%。與二○二四年下半年錄得的「無鼠百分比」相比，在全港19個調查分區中，16個調查分區（約84%）的「無鼠百分比」錄得上升，反映鼠患情況改善。

會上，食環署介紹如何善用「無鼠百分比」的數據，以制定更具針對性的措施，進一步提升防治鼠患的效能。此外，食環署持續針對93個鼠患主要黑點進行策略性滅鼠行動，調撥資源，務求全面及持續地改善有關黑點的鼠患情況，預計可在二○二五年年底前達成將黑點數目減少六成的目標。

另外，房屋署及康樂及文化事務署（康文署）亦於會上匯報在其轄下場館及管轄範圍內所進行的滅鼠工作。

康文署在會上特別匯報新蒲崗休憩處鼠患的最新情況，並將在食環署的支援下，持續進行防鼠滅鼠工作。至今，在該處捕獲的活鼠及檢獲的死鼠合共有23隻。另外，康文署在其他部門的配合下亦正部署執法行動，以懲處餵飼老鼠而弄髒地方的行為。再者，食環署會短期內在該處安裝熱能探測攝錄機，以監測鼠患情況及防治鼠患措施的成效。食環署更會按既定準則及優次將該處納入二○二六年鼠隻活動調查的監察範圍。

防治鼠患成效有賴各界持份者齊心協力。環境及生態局會繼續統籌「各界攜手，全港滅鼠行動」，推動跨界別、多專業及市民共同採取措施，攜手全面防治鼠患。食環署在二○二四年十二月三十一日推出首階段針對住宅處所的《滅鼠約章》（《約章》），提高居民對保持環境衞生的意識和養成良好的習慣，以締造一個無鼠環境。截至二○二五年十一月二十五日，共有684個住宅處所簽署《約章》，涵蓋約65萬住戶。當中，有兩個是「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃的參與者，涵蓋逾40個住戶。當其他「聯廈聯管」的參與者準備就緒，將會獲邀簽署《約章》。

環境及生態局副局長兼委員會主席黃淑嫻在會上促請政府各部門密切留意已識別為高危地方的蚊患情況，並在其管轄範疇內加強防蚊滅蚊工作。就鼠患方面，黃淑嫻強調跨部門協作及公眾參與對應對鼠患問題十分重要，各部門應繼續積極聯同各界鞏固防治鼠患工作，並鼓勵市民配合防鼠滅鼠行動。

今日的會議由黃淑嫻主持，出席的決策局、政府部門及機構代表有：漁農自然護理署、建築署、土木工程拓展署、發展局、衞生署、渠務署、教育局、機電工程署、環境保護署、食環署、政府產業署、醫院管理局、民政事務總署、房屋署、路政署、地政總署、康文署、海事處和水務署。"
FS convenes meeting to enhance co-ordination of financial support for residents affected by Tai Po fire,2025-11-28 20:45,2025-11-28 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800765.htm,"The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, this afternoon (November 28) convened a coordination meeting with financial regulators to enhance support for residents affected by the recent fire incident at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, attended the meeting, along with senior representatives from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Insurance Authority (IA), the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Schemes Authority, and the Securities and Futures Commission.

At the meeting, Mr Chan instructed the financial regulators to step up coordination and mobilise banks, insurance companies, MPF trustees and other financial institutions to provide timely and effective assistance to the affected residents. For examples:


proactively reaching out to affected residents to understand their needs and offer assistance;
streamlining procedures and expediting the processing of service and claims applications with discretion, wherever possible;
adopting a lenient approach in handling delayed payments of loans, contributions and insurance premiums by affected individuals;
giving priority and simplifying procedures in handling account matters related to the deceased;
establishing a cross-sectoral coordination mechanism among financial institutions to enhance information flow and speed up response efforts; and
extending service hours of bank branches in the district on Saturdays and Sundays to better serve local residents.


Mr Chan said, ""The residents affected by the fire are going through an extremely difficult time. Financial institutions should adopt a compassionate and empathetic approach, respond flexibly to the actual circumstances and needs of each family, and proactively provide appropriate support.""

He stressed that addressing the immediate needs of the affected residents is the top priority. During the post-incident recovery and beyond, sustained support and care to the residents will be essential. He expressed hope that banks, insurers and other financial service providers would introduce ongoing support measures to help relieve any future financial pressure faced by the affected residents.

In line with the above directives, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Association of Banks will separately announce further measures today.

Separately, the IA has set up a dedicated task force to coordinate the insurance sector's responses, including the handling of public enquiries and claims. Insurers are also offering various forms of assistance, including prioritising claims processing, expediting payouts (such as waiving the requirement to produce a death certificate for death benefit claims), offering premium holidays or extended payment deadlines, and providing interest relief on policy loans. Some insurers are also providing emergency cash assistance or making advance payments to cover temporary accommodation costs."

周六周日延長當區銀行服務時間，方便居民。


陳茂波表示：「受火災影響的居民正處於非常艱難的時刻，各金融機構應本着體恤和具同理心的態度，因應每個家庭的實際狀況和需要，採取更靈活和更具彈性的安排，酌情處理受影響居民的各項申請和需求，並主動為他們提供支援。」

他在會議上特別強調，受火災影響居民在目前的迫切需要是大家首要照顧好的事情；在善後以及日後的階段，須高度重視對他們的持續支持和照顧，希望銀行、保險及其他金融機構也就此為受災居民提供持續的支持方案，以緩解未來可能出現的資金壓力。

其中，金管局與香港銀行公會今日按照上述指示，將提出進一步措施，詳情另行公布。

此外，保監局已成立專責小組，協調保險業界處理客戶的查詢和理賠工作。各保險公司亦正以不同方式為受影響人士作出援助，例如在保單服務方面，會優先處理索賠申請、加快賠償程序（例如豁免申請身故賠償時所需的死亡證明）、提供保費假期或延長保單繳款期限、提供保單貸款利息減免等；同時，亦發放緊急現金援助、預付臨時住宿費用等。"
蚊傳疾病基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況,2025-11-28 19:40,2025-11-28 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800706.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十八日）公布基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況。

基孔肯雅熱
—————

截至今日下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

個案涉及一名63歲男子，居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，他曾於十一月九至十四日及十一月十九日分別到訪海南省三亞市和廣東省深圳市。他於十一月二十五日出現關節痛，並於昨日（十一月二十七日）出現發燒及皮疹，同日到仁濟醫院急症室求醫，獲安排留院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

病人有兩名家居接觸者，亦是前往三亞市的同行人士，而其中一名家居接觸者連同另外六人曾與他一同到深圳市。上述人士暫時均沒有病徵，並正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪中國內地，中心初步認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報中國內地衞生當局。

近期錄得的輸入個案中，有五名患者居於青衣。中心已完成相關病人樣本的基因排序及分析，結果顯示：


兩名屬同一家庭的患者，分別為60歲女病人（十一月二十一日確診）及66歲男病人（十一月二十二日確診），其基因序列相同，顯示有共同感染源頭，惟該序列與其他本地或輸入個案不同。由於兩人於潛伏期內曾到訪廣東省深圳市，中心認為該家庭群組屬輸入個案；
另外兩名互不認識的患者，包括一名居於偉景花園的63歲男病人（十一月二十日確診）及一名居於青衣邨的49歲女病人（十一月二十三日確診），其基因序列完全相同，顯示兩人有共同感染源頭，但與其他本地或輸入個案（包括上述家庭群組）及廣東省其他已進行基因分析的個案不同。中心的流行病學調查發現，兩人在潛伏期及發病後於青衣北的活動範圍有重疊，主要涉及青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近，中心不排除區內早前有未被診斷的輸入個案將病毒傳播給蚊子，導致兩人受感染。基於流行病學調查及基因數據分析，中心現將這兩宗個案判定為本地感染個案；及
餘下一名53歲女病人（十一月二十一日確診）的樣本因病毒量過低而無法進行基因分析，由於她發病前約兩周內曾前往中山，被列為輸入個案。


​就近日在青衣居住的輸入及本地個案，中心在接獲通報後已即時進行流行病學調查及把他們的活動地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），以進行控蚊滅蚊行動。鑑於部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心自十一月二十三日起呼籲近日曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線2125 2373。熱線每日上午九時至下午八時運作。中心接獲兩名有輕微病徵的人士致電查詢，並已安排他們進行抽血檢查，其中一人的樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性，另一名人士的化驗工作正在進行。中心本周亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。政府各相關部門已經針對所有輸入個案加強蚊媒防控措施，以及在當區進行個案主動追蹤工作，因此上述兩宗本地個案對現時整體的風險評估沒有太大影響。

因應基因排序及分析結果而重新界定上述兩宗個案為本地個案後，本港今年累計錄得73宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，六宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

登革熱
———

由十一月二十一日至昨日（十一月二十七日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期到過泰國。

截至昨日，今年錄得55宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞去年（二○二四年）錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。由二○二五年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點亦普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度和越南今年已分別錄得超過九萬宗個案，馬來西亞和泰國亦分別錄得超過四萬宗個案，新加坡則錄得超過3 500宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得3 449宗本地感染病例，其中110宗病例於十一月十日至十六日的一周內錄得，以潮州、汕頭、深圳、惠州和佛山錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

繼續加強防控
——————

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

•在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
•巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
•加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

•先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
•在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
•塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
•孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
•先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
•遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
•除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

CFS announces food safety report for October,2025-11-28 19:00,2025-11-28 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800201.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (November 28) released the findings of its food safety report for last month. The results of about 6 600 food samples tested (including food items purchased online) were found to be satisfactory except for eight unsatisfactory samples that were announced earlier. The overall satisfactory rate was 99.9 per cent.

A CFS spokesman said that about 1 600 food samples were collected for microbiological tests, and about 5 000 samples were taken for chemical and radiation level tests.

The microbiological tests covered pathogens and hygiene indicators; the chemical tests included testing for pesticides, preservatives, metallic contaminants, colouring matters, veterinary drug residues and others; and the radiation-level tests included testing for radioactive caesium and iodine in samples collected from imported food from different regions.

The samples comprised about 2 200 samples of vegetables and fruit and their products; about 400 samples of cereals, grains and their products; about 900 samples of meat and poultry and their products; about 800 samples of milk, milk products and frozen confections; about 900 samples of aquatic and related products; and about 1 400 samples of other food commodities (including beverages, bakery products and snacks).

The eight unsatisfactory samples comprised two green radish samples, a sweet potato sample and a beetroot sample detected with pesticide residues exceeding the legal limits; two ice cream samples and a raw milk sample detected with coliform bacteria counts exceeding the legal limits; and a bottled preserved bean curd sample found with excessive Bacillus cereus.

The CFS has taken follow-up actions on the above-mentioned unsatisfactory samples, including informing the vendors concerned of the test results, instructing them to stop selling the affected food items, and tracing the sources of the food items in question.

The spokesman reminded the food trade to ensure that food is fit for human consumption and meets legal requirements. Consumers should patronise reliable shops when buying food and maintain a balanced diet to minimise food risks.

Separately, in response to the Japanese Government's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the CFS will continue enhancing the testing on imported Japanese food, and make reference to the risk assessment results to adjust relevant surveillance work in a timely manner. The CFS will announce every working day on its dedicated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/daily_japan_nuclear_incidents.html) the radiological test results of the samples of food imported from Japan, with a view to enabling the trade and members of the public to have a better grasp of the latest safety information."

記者︰暫時看起火原因會在哪幾方面？見到有些片段或相片有些工人在棚架吸煙，這個（導致火警）的可能性有多大？暫時看「翻燒」的可能性有多大？最快何時可以解封給居民回家拿財物，會否要等三至四個星期？警方進去搜證之後才可以？

保安局局長：首先我們根據目前掌握到的情況，我們相信是在宏昌閣低層開始起火，燒着棚網後，很快引到上去燒着圍住玻璃窗的發泡膠板，導致火勢迅速蔓延，燒到其他樓層和其他大廈。這是我們初步理解到的成因，包括發泡膠板起火後，高溫令玻璃爆破，爆破後火燒進室內，令室外和室內同時大範圍起火。另外，有關「翻燒」情況，現時消防同事已經在灑水，我們相信「翻燒」情況機會不高，但同事要確保現場除了不會「翻燒」外，溫度降到一個安全的溫度，剛才亦提過，部分樓層現時溫度仍達200度，絕對不適宜在這個階段入去，但當然我們每棟大廈達致安全的情況下，就會首先讓屋宇署同事進去巡查，確保樓宇安全後，就會讓警方進去調查，所需的時間大約三至四個星期，我們希望能夠盡快，早一天得一天，將地方解封，讓市民回去處理他們的事情。

記者：想請教八座大廈的消防系統的火警鐘是人為因素關閉還是其他故障？現在有沒有一個確實生還者的數字？最差的情況，有沒有可能一些在大廈內的遺體是完全沒有機會（被）識別？有沒有方法令到每一個人都可以知道自己親屬的情況？

保安局局長：或者我先回答第二部分，而有關於火警鐘，我稍後讓消防處處長回答大家。有關於遺體辨認，警方有很多這方面的訓練，包括可以從受害人身邊的物件，或者從受害人身體特徵，例如有沒有疤痕，最後可以用DNA確認（身分），我們會盡量將遺體的身分辨認出來。有關於防火鐘，我交給楊恩健處長。

消防處處長：有關八座大廈的消防警鐘，我們昨天已派出防火組的同事立即做檢測，（看看）操作是否有效。我們發覺這八座大廈的警鐘操作有問題，所以我們隨即已收集相關資料，將會對這些相關的消防設備承辦商採取執法行動。

記者：剛才一開始說到起火在宏昌閣，實際燒着了網的原因是甚麼？是否準則不夠高？這次有120人死亡，怎樣看外界認為這是人禍的說法呢？

保安局局長：首先，現時初步調查是指宏昌閣低層的圍網先起火，剛才我也說過，我們初步的研究（所得）是這些圍網的阻燃度是合乎要求的，但發泡膠是高度易燃，我們初步調查確信，這些燒着了的發泡膠令溫度非常高，令圍網包括竹枝和其他物件都起火，也包括玻璃爆破後這些火飛進室內燒着了室內雜物。大家要明白這些圍網雖然達到一定阻燃要求，但當遇到高溫時都會起火，包括竹棚都會起火，只是阻燃而已，這就是我們初步（調查所得）的情況。至於目前的調查來說，我們會包括一個整體的刑事調查，以及昨天行政長官也說了，我們有幾個不同的工作組，就剛才所說的關注事項會作出詳細調查，這些工作組在適當時候也會將調查結果向公眾解說。

記者：怎看人禍這問題？

保安局局長：我剛才說了，我們工作組會將調查結果稍後向大家解說。

記者：剛才提到的事故調查除了進行調查之外，會否對經濟損失展開調查？會涉及甚麼機構及甚麼應對措施？

保安局局長：就着在一些經濟援助方面，剛才我也提到了，無論是政府或社會各界對於今次的受害人及家屬都會提供很多協助，包括一些即時現金協助，這些只是即時的，稍後還會有很多其他協助，包括住宿方面的協助，稍後麥局長（民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟）和孫局長（勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡）會有另外一個新聞發報會，就着我們如何協助這些受害人士及家人作出詳細的解說。

保安局局長就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）（二）,2025-11-28 18:35,2025-11-28 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800663.htm,"保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十一月二十八日）聯同署理警務處處長簡啟恩、消防處處長楊恩健、消防處副處長（行動）陳慶勇和警務處新界北總區指揮官林敏嫻就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的開場發言（第二部分）：

消防處處長：各位傳媒朋友，有關宏福苑的五級火警，消防處於今日早上十時十八分已經完成有關滅火救援及搜救的工作。在今次行動中，消防處總共出動391架次消防車輛及185架次救護車輛，一共出動2 311名消防及救護人員。事件中有12名消防人員受傷，其中一位同事現時仍在深切治療部，他有熱衰竭的現象；其他同事的傷勢包括骨折或吸入濃煙。另外我們有一位同事，隸屬沙田消防局的隊員何偉豪，在行動中英勇殉職。

剛才局長也說到，我們今次面對很大困難，主要是我們在一些樓梯或窗戶發現發泡膠，這是非常易燃的物品，當有火警發生時，（火勢）會蔓延得很快，而火警蔓延至單位內，令同一時間不同樓宇的多個單位起火，同一時間亦引致很多求助個案。同事一方面要處理這些求助個案，亦必須將不同單位的火警撲滅，一步一步推進。

至於剛才局長也有提到，網上有很多討論關於我們的（滅火救援）行動，我在此一一講解。有（網上意見）提及過為何不在行動中使用直升機，我必須強調，今次火警如在樓宇上空用直升機投擲水彈，水並不會落入火場中，只會淋到大廈外圍，與滅火行動沒有直接關係。第二，我們要考慮的是直升機駛近樓宇時，會產生大量空氣，會令火警蔓延得更快更大。

另外有網民提到為何消防處不使用更高的雲梯車。我必須在此告訴大家，這些較高，例如100米的雲梯車，我們要使用這些雲梯時，大家可以見到我們現在用的56米雲梯車，是需要在行動時在車的兩端展開支撐腳，該支撐腳有闊度，愈高的雲梯車，地面（所需）的闊度便愈闊。現時緊急車輛通道的（闊度）要求是六米，而用100米雲梯車的闊度是十米，所以這些雲梯車在香港大部分道路都不能使用。

第三方面，是（質疑）為何不用無人機滅火。大家可能在視頻中看過無人機滅火的片段，在這方面，我們和廣東省消防總隊有緊密聯繫，無人機滅火現時在消防總隊中仍在探索階段、試行階段。使用無人機時，我們要考慮的是現在無人機盛載的滅火喉的直徑，是遠遠比現時我們的消防喉直徑為小，代表（無人機）能用作滅火的水量相對較少，如今次多個單位起火的情況，使用無人機向單位射水並非有效做法。

另一方面，有人提到這幾座大廈的火警鐘沒有響。消防處昨日已派出防火組的專責隊伍檢查（宏福苑）八幢大廈消防系統的火警鐘，發現（火警鐘）不能有效操作。在這方面，我們即將採取執法行動。

有關調查方面，我也要在此告訴大家。跨部門調查專組已經成立，由消防處助理處長（新界南）帶領，並由副消防總長（新界南）擔任副主席，當中參與部門包括警務處、屋宇署、機電工程署、房屋署、勞工處及政府化驗所，他們很快便會展開相關調查工作，調查方向主要分開兩方面，第一方面是調查火警的成因，以及火警蔓延迅速的成因；第二方面是環境引致大量死傷（的成因）。

接下來我交由消防處副處長（行動）講解昨日滅火救援行動中遇到的困難，以及成功拯救一名被困於大廈的傷者。

消防處副處長（行動）：各位傳媒朋友，大家好。我會交代消防處昨日至今早的救援行動。在這段期間，我們對七座大廈超過1 800個單位的大門進行爆破，繼而進入單位進行搜索行動，確保單位內沒有被困人士。在這段期間，有個別單位出現「翻燒」現象，令我們的搜救行動倍感困難。雖然如此，我們仍然成功於昨晚六時三十分左右，在宏道閣16樓的梯間成功救出一名男性傷者，而他是清醒的。我的簡報到此為止。

署理警務處處長：有關十一月二十六日星期三在大埔宏福苑發生的五級大火，事件導致多人傷亡，包括一名消防員在行動中英勇殉職，我們感到非常難過和痛心。我代表警隊，向遇難者家屬致最深切的慰問，並祝願受傷人士早日康復。

警方高度重視這宗火警事件。案發後，隨即動員超過1 000名警務人員，除負責維持秩序、協助救援及提供緊急支援外，我們亦協調居民疏散及交通安排。

警方已設立傷者查詢熱線，熱線號碼是1878 999、1878 999，市民如懷疑親友在今次火警中失蹤，可致電此熱線求助。這是重大事故或災難時我們設立的專用熱線，供市民查詢懷疑在事件中受傷或失聯的親友的情況。熱線由專責人員集中接聽和收集資料，協助致電者了解相關的狀況。

警方亦會使用「重大事件調查及災難支援系統」，將失蹤者和災難中傷亡人士的資料輸入這個系統，透過自動校對功能，識別傷亡人士身分，以加快協助（處理）公眾人士對失蹤者的查詢。

另外，警方亦於大埔廣福社區會堂設立辨認處，協助失聯者家屬經相片（進行）初步辨認程序，希望協助有關家屬能盡快得知失聯親人的情況，縮短家屬對親友生死未卜的煎熬。在完成初步辨認後，警方會盡快安排有關家屬進行正式的遺體辨認程序。

另外，警方會繼續全力進行調查及善後工作。我們會調動「災難遇害者辨認組」，調配一切可行的人手及資源，務求在最短時間內，有系統地辨認遇害者身分，協助家屬確認親友下落，並為後續調查及善後工作提供證據。

在消防同事完成工作後，警方會盡快接手現場，進行調查工作。每當消防同事確認一棟大廈安全，警方就會立即接手該棟大廈，並派員上樓進行搜索和調查。我們的最終目標是同一時間在七棟大廈，一齊進行搜索和調查。警方已經安排足夠人手，隨時接手這些工作。我們預計這個搜查行動及搜證工作會有一定挑戰，因為根據消防同事所提供的資料，現場有部分範圍溫度仍超過攝氏200度，我們需要等降溫後才可以進場，加上在火災後，大廈內的環境惡劣，不少物品亦倒塌，導致搜查空間非常狹窄。為了讓受影響的市民可以盡快返回住所，我們會分階段解封各棟涉事的大廈，即是每完成一棟大廈的搜證後，就立刻解封該大廈，希望讓市民能盡快回到他們的住所，了解情況及做善後工作。

在調查方面，正如剛才局長所說，警方已經就火警懷疑涉及的罪行，拘捕三名52歲至68歲的男子，他們是涉事建築工程公司的兩名董事和一名工程顧問。警方亦到他們的寫字樓和住所搜集大量證據。這三名男子仍然被扣查，我們正尋求律政司的緊急法律意見。

有關調查起火原因方面，警方和消防處已經成立了專案小組，對事件作出全面調查，一定會將這宗案件提交死因裁判法庭處理。

警方極度重視今次火災，已準備好在現場條件許可的情況下，動員最大的資源，全方位蒐證及調查，部分樓宇預計在今日稍後時間可安排警方入內調查，整個調查過程可能需要三至四星期，警方有信心和有足夠人手處理。

我們明白這事件帶來的不單是損失，還有許多市民揮之不去的焦慮和深切的悲傷。往後日子，我們會繼續竭盡所能，恪守職責，陪伴大家一起走過這段最難熬的時間。"

âReporter: Can you tell us whether there is gonna be any compensation for the residents? A lot of them right now thinking about how they can get... (inaudible). Secondly, can you give us an update on the corruption investigation regarding the construction company?

Secretary for Security: First of all, investigation regarding any corruption allegation or investigations will be done by the ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption). Secondly, you talked about compensation. About financial assistance to all the victims and their families, our Government has different schemes to support their families. I also understand that a lot of private organisations are also organising it. As a matter of fact, Secretary Alice Mak (Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs) and Secretary Chris Sun (Secretary for Labour and Welfare) will hold a separate press conference later to elaborate on all the financial assistance and other kinds of assistance that we can offer to the victims and their families.

Reporter: It has been three days after the fire, why isn't there any basic demographic of the deceased or the injured as you already got the information and condition of the people? Why don't you release them to the public?

Secretary for Security: Thank you very much. In fact we are releasing the information right now. As a matter of fact, for the time being, there are 128 diseased individuals that we discovered, including 108 bodies we removed from the scene and four who passed away in the hospital. There are 16 burned bodies that are still inside the building. In fact, our Police, as a special team, they are going to deal with all the missing persons or identities of the deceased. Maybe we can repeat the phone number. You can make a call with the phone number.

Acting Commissioner of Police: We have set up a Casualty Enquiry Unit and a hotline. The hotline number is 1878 999, 1878 999. Thank you.

Reporter: (Inaudible)

Secretary for Security: I think we need time to get all the details. As I said, even some of the deceased we cannot fully identify. At an appropriate time, when we gather all the information, we are happy to release all the information that the public is concerned about. There is nothing the Government is unwilling to release.

保安局局長就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）（一）,2025-11-28 17:19,2025-11-28 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800616.htm,"保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十一月二十八日）聯同署理警務處處長簡啟恩、消防處處長楊恩健、消防處副處長（行動）陳慶勇和警務處新界北總區指揮官林敏嫻就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的開場發言（第一部分）：

保安局局長︰各位香港市民、各位記者朋友，大家好，我首先再次就大埔宏福苑嚴重火警的所有死傷人士，包括殉職的消防員和他們所有的家人，致以最深切的哀悼和慰問。

到目前為止，這場大火已經造成128名人士死亡，包括108名在現場移送出來的遺體，另外有4名是送到醫院後、在醫院去世的人士，也包括了16具燒焦的遺體，現在仍然在大廈裏。我們不排除稍後當警方進入（現場）作詳細的調查和搜證時，有機會另外再發現一些燒焦的遺體。在這128名死者中，有39名已經確認他們的身分。在餘下的遺體當中，大約有一半是在單位裏面找到。我們相信稍後能辨認他們的身分。另外餘下的40多具遺體，可能還要用一些時間才能確認他們的身分。另外，目前有79名受傷人士。

在火警期間，警方一共接獲了467個有關失蹤人口的求助個案，當中其實有部分是重複的。我們現在確定了這些失去聯絡人士有39名是死者，有35名是確認已經送去醫院的受傷人士，有110人現在情況安全，大約還有200名人士情況未明。這200名人士包括89個未能確切辨認的遺體。

我們初步化驗了大廈的棚網、保護網，初步化驗發覺它達到阻燃的要求，但是包圍大廈窗戶的發泡膠板是高度易燃的，根據現在我們初步掌握的資料，我們相信最初起火的位置是宏昌閣低層外面的圍網。其後由於燃燒了發泡膠板，火勢迅速向上蔓延，伸延到多個樓層，並在短時間內波及宏福苑其他六座樓宇，大火引燃了貼在窗戶上的發泡膠板，令玻璃爆破，導致火勢急速增強，並且迅速蔓延到室內。短時間內，室內室外大面積同時起火，最終釀成這次災難。另外，高溫也令竹棚和棚網燃燒，燒斷了的竹枝也飛墜，引致其他樓層着火。當然，正式起火原因仍然有待進一步調查。

我們這次救火面對很大困難，首先火勢蔓延異常迅速，短時間內波及七座樓宇。另外，高層的棚架不斷跌下來，堵塞部分緊急車輛的出口，以及一些大廈的出入口，也嚴重阻礙消防同事進入樓宇內救援，也令消防車輛的旋轉台鋼梯難以停在最佳的作業位置。樓宇火勢非常猛烈，現場溫度非常高，高達500度，有時甚至超過500度，消防同事進行滅火時，遇到非常高溫的情況，也令同事不能輕易推進到一些較高的樓層。樓宇內的空間非常狹窄，限制了每層可以工作的人手數目。消防同事需要逐層和逐個單位進行滅火和救援工作，而且單位內的雜物相當多，大大增加我們工作的困難。消防處在整個滅火過程中，由於現場溫度極高，所以個別單位發生了死灰復燃的情況，因此同事是需要重複到一些個別單位進行滅火工作，亦增加了工作的難度。

現在現場基本上已經完成了滅火和救援工作，現時目標是盡快為火場降溫。在降溫之後，我們會盡快安排屋宇署的同事進去檢查，確認樓宇安全之後，我們就會請警方的同事進行搜證和進一步工作。

就警方的刑事調查方面，昨日拘捕了三名年齡介乎52至68歲的男子，分別是涉事建築公司的兩名董事和一名工程顧問。另外警方亦去到那間公司的寫字樓和其中一名被捕人的住所進行搜證，檢取了14部電腦和大量文件，這三名男子仍然繼續被扣留調查。警方現在正在尋求律政司的緊急法律意見。

我們極度重視這次火災。警方已經準備好當現場條件許可和安全情況下，動員最大的資源，全方位去蒐證和調查。相信部分樓宇最快可能在今天稍後時間，就能夠安排警方的同事進入調查。整個調查時間預計可能需要三至四個星期，警方將會和消防處緊密合作，繼續組成專班進行聯合調查。

我想在此感謝消防處的同事連日來日以繼夜、不眠不休地進行滅火救援工作。我留意到有些人質疑消防處的救援工作，我覺得這對於救火的同事非常不公道，稍後我會請消防處處長向大家進一步解說。

我亦要感謝所有在火災期間參與救援和為受影響市民提供支援的不同政府部門的同事。我亦看見香港社會各界非常熱心，紛紛提供不同援助，我相信災民一定感受到人間有愛。我在這裏也要衷心感謝中央政府和廣東省相關部門對於特區的全力支持和迅速協助，為香港提供了所需要的很多裝備。

但我亦留意到網上開始有很多假消息，包括說政府沒有為災民提供免費住宿，令他們要住八千元一晚的酒店；也有些人訛稱自己是消防員，不夠基本保護裝備、沒有飯吃，要等市民送飯來才有飯吃，這些全部都是不正確的消息。這些有心人散播這些不正確的消息，是希望分化社會。我希望現在社會團結一致、一起處理好這件事的善後工作，不應該讓這些想搞亂香港的人有任何空間。

我現在首先交給消防處的楊恩健處長和陳慶勇副處長補充講解，稍後由警務處的簡啟恩署理處長和新界北總區指揮官林敏嫻補充。"
CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another fatal case of paediatric influenza infection recorded,2025-11-28 17:10,2025-11-28 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800534.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (November 28) announced that regarding a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection in a 2-year-old girl yesterday (November 27), the patient unfortunately passed away last night due to complications.The CHP urged schools and parents to arrange for students and their children to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

 ""The girl had good past health. This is the third fatal case of paediatric influenza infection this year. Including this case, 13 severe paediatric influenza cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes in September, with only one having received this year's SIV prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination; in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine. To avoid recurrence of such tragedies, I urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly, especially high-risk groups such as children, the elderly, and adults with underlying illnesses and immunosuppression. Apart from receiving the SIV through various programmes launched by the Government, members of the public may also contact their family doctors to arrange vaccinations,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

 ""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity has gradually declined since late October. However, it remains above the baseline thresholds. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, at nearly 17 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" Dr Tsui added.

 Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

 Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

 For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."
再有兒童感染流感離世　衞生防護中心呼籲學童盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-28 17:10,2025-11-28 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800532.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十八日）公布，昨日（十一月二十七日）一宗兩歲女童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，病人因併發症延至昨晚不治。中心再次呼籲學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「女童過往健康良好，是今年第三宗兒童感染流感後不幸離世的個案。計及這宗個案，本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃由九月展開後已錄得13宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案，當中只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。為避免類似的不幸事件發生，我呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗，務必立即行動，尤其是高風險群組，例如兒童、長者、患有慢性疾病和免疫抑制的成年人。市民除了透過政府的各項計劃接種季節性流感疫苗，亦可以聯絡自己的家庭醫生安排接種。」

徐樂堅醫生續說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度自十月下旬起逐漸下降，但仍高於基線水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近17%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

十一月份第六批涵蓋11個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及三個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十一月共六批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共59個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這59個監察區中，46個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有13區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the sixth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 11 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering three survey areas in November, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released six batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in November 2025, covering 59 survey areas. Among these 59 survey areas, 46 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. October 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Thirteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation, and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

（外匯基金諮詢委員會以傳閱方式批准公布）

二○二五年六月二十一日至十月八日期間的貨幣發行局運作報告
————————————————————————————

貨幣發行委員會（委員會）獲悉，於報告期內，港元兌美元在7.7705至7.8500之間上落。港元匯率在六月中至八月中期間貼近弱方兌換保證的水平，報告期內弱方兌換保證被觸發十二次。金管局在弱方兌換保證下買入1,199.5億港元，總結餘相應減少至約540億港元。自八月中以來，由於短期銀行同業拆息上升及港股通南向資金持續錄得淨流入，港元轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，港元銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率走勢，同時亦受本地港元資金供求情況影響。隨着總結餘下降，港元銀行同業拆息自八月中以來上升，港元與美元的負息差收窄。與此同時，繼美國聯邦基金利率目標區間於九月中下調後，多間銀行將其最優惠貸款利率調低12.5基點。於報告期末，市場上的最優惠貸款利率介乎5.125厘至5.625厘之間。貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。整體而言，港元外匯及銀行同業市場交易繼續暢順有序。

委員會獲悉，於報告期末時貨幣基礎減少至20,206.9億港元。貨幣基礎的所有變動與外匯儲備的變動完全一致，符合貨幣發行局制度的原則。

報告期內貨幣發行局制度的運作報告載於附件。

對風險及不穩定因素的監察
————————————

委員會注意到，隨着關稅上升，美國經濟出現放緩跡象，通脹上升，而勞工需求動力亦減弱。與此同時，市場對財政及政策發展的憂慮已對長期美國國庫券收益率造成影響。最近美國政府停擺事件進一步加深美國經濟前景的不確定性。儘管亞洲區在二○二五年上半年錄得具韌性增長，貿易政策的不確定性持續及美國的直接與間接關稅對整個地區的潛在影響，預期會繼續對亞洲區內綜合供應鏈網絡構成壓力。

委員會注意到，中國內地的增長動力在第三季放緩。短期經濟前景面對多項不明朗因素及風險，例如進一步加徵關稅及其對全球貿易的持續影響，以及內地房地產市場再度轉弱。

委員會注意到，受惠於出口表現強勁及本地需求改善，香港在第二季度錄得穩健的經濟增長。展望未來，在政府支持、內地刺激經濟措施及資產市場轉趨穩定等多項因素帶動下，預期香港經濟將維持溫和增長。隨着市場氣氛改善，樓市進一步回穩，但商用物業市場則繼續面對空置率高企的挑戰。

Record of discussion of meeting of Exchange Fund Advisory Committee Currency Board Sub-Committee held on October 20,2025-11-28 16:42,2025-11-28 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800483.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

(Approved for issue by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee by circulation)

Report on Currency Board Operations (June 21 – October 8, 2025)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Currency Board Sub-Committee (Sub-Committee) noted that the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) traded within a range of 7.7705 – 7.8500 against the US dollar (USD) during the review period. The HKD stayed close to the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) between mid-June and mid-August, and the weak-side CU was triggered 12 times during the review period. With the HKMA buying HK$119.95 billion under the weak-side CU, the Aggregate Balance fell correspondingly to around HK$54 billion. Since mid-August, the HKD had strengthened as short-term HKD interbank rates (HIBORs) firmed and net buying flows through Southbound Stock Connect continued. While HIBORs generally tracked their USD counterparts under the Linked Exchange Rate System, they were also influenced by the local supply and demand of HKD funding. Amid the reduction in the Aggregate Balance, HIBORs picked up since mid-August and the negative HKD-USD interest rate spread narrowed. Meanwhile, following the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in mid-September, many banks reduced their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points, and the Best Lending Rates in the market ranged from 5.125 per cent – 5.625 per cent at the end of the review period. No abnormality was noted in the usage of the Discount Window. Overall, the HKD exchange and interbank markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.

The Sub-Committee noted that the Monetary Base decreased to HK$2,020.69billion at the end of the review period. In accordance with the Currency Board principles, all changes in the Monetary Base had been fully matched by changes in foreign reserves.

The Report on Currency Board Operations for the review period is atAnnex.

Monitoring of Risks and Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------------
The Sub-Committee noted that the US economy showed signs of softening amid higher tariffs, with inflation rising on the one hand and labour demand losing momentum on the other. Meanwhile, market concerns over fiscal and policy developments had affected long-term US Treasury bond yields. The recent US government shutdown added further uncertainty to the US economic outlook. While Asia recorded resilient growth in the first half of 2025, lingering trade policy uncertainty and the potential effects of direct and indirect US tariffs on the broader region would continue to weigh on Asia's integrated supply chain networks.

The Sub-Committee noted that in the Chinese Mainland, growth momentum moderated in Q3. The near-term economic outlook was clouded by various uncertainties and risks, such as additional tariffs and their repercussions on global trade, as well as renewed softness in the local housing market.

The Sub-Committee noted that in Hong Kong, the economy maintained solid growth in Q2 on the back of strong exports performance and improved domestic demand. Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy was expected to sustain moderate growth, driven by various factors such as government support, the Mainland's economic stimulus measures, and stabilising asset markets. The housing market stabilised further alongside strengthened market sentiment, whereas the commercial real estate markets continued to face challenges of high vacancy rates.

Updates on Interbank Liquidity and Interbank Interest Rates
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sub-Committee received an update on the relationship between HKD interbank liquidity and interbank interest rates, incorporating recent market observations and insights."
Residential Mortgage Survey Results for October 2025,2025-11-28 16:30,2025-11-28 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800461.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced the results of the residential mortgage survey for October 2025.

The number of mortgage applications in October decreased month-on-month by 0.7per cent to 8 255. 

Mortgage loans approved in October were HK$31.3 billion, broadly unchanged compared with September. Among these, mortgage loans financing primary market transactions decreased by 2.1per cent to HK$12.4 billion and those financing secondary market transactions increased by 3.4 per cent to HK$16 billion. Mortgage loans for refinancing decreased by 8.4per cent to HK$3 billion.

Mortgage loans drawn down during October decreased by 3.5 per cent compared with September to HK$20.1 billion.

The ratio of new mortgage loans priced with reference to HIBOR decreased from 92.6per cent in September to 91.9per cent in October. The ratio of new mortgage loans priced with reference to best lending rates decreased from 1.5per cent in September to 1.3per cent in October.

The outstanding value of mortgage loans increased month-on-month by 0.8per cent to HK$1,907.4 billion at end-October.

The mortgage delinquency ratio stood at a low level of 0.13per cent and the rescheduled loan ratio was unchanged at nearly 0 per cent."
Monetary Statistics for October 2025,2025-11-28 16:30,2025-11-28 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800354.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

According to statistics published today (November 28) by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, total deposits with authorized institutions decreased by 0.4 per cent in October 2025. Among the total, Hong Kong dollar deposits and foreign currency deposits decreased by 0.9 per cent and 0.1per cent respectively in October, mainly reflecting fund flows of corporates. In the year to end-October, total deposits and Hong Kong dollar deposits increased by 9.7per cent and 3.1per cent respectively. Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong decreased by 0.6per cent in October to RMB996.2 billion at the end of October. The total remittance of renminbi for cross-border trade settlement amounted to RMB1,006.6 billion in October, compared with RMB1,123.2 billion in September. It should be noted that changes in deposits are affected by a wide range of factors, such as interest rate movements and fund-raising activities. It is therefore more appropriate to observe the longer-term trends, and not to over-generalise fluctuations in a single month.

Total loans and advances decreased by 0.7per cent in October, while increased by 0.9per cent in the year to end-October. Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong (including trade finance) and loans for use outside Hong Kong decreased by 0.9per cent and 0.2per cent respectively in October. The Hong Kong dollar loan-to-deposit ratio remained virtually unchanged at 73.6per cent at the end of October, as Hong Kong dollar loans and Hong Kong dollar deposits decreased at a similar pace.

Hong Kong dollar M2 and M3 both decreased by 0.6per cent in October, while both increased by 3.5per cent when compared to a year ago. The seasonally-adjusted Hong Kong dollar M1 increased by 1.7per cent in October, and increased by 12.2per cent compared to a year ago, reflecting in part investment-related activities.

As monthly monetary statistics are subject to volatilities due to a wide range of transient factors, such as seasonal funding demand as well as business and investment-related activities, caution is required when interpreting the statistics."

Exchange Fund Abridged Balance Sheet and Currency Board Account,2025-11-28 16:30,2025-11-28 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800351.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (November 28) that the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$4,117.6billion as at October 31,2025, HK$34.6 billion lower than that at the end of September 2025. Hong Kong dollar assets decreased by HK$92.6 billion while foreign currency assets increased by HK$58.0 billion.

The decline in Hong Kong dollar assets was mainly due to the decrease in Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued but not yet settled at month end and mark-to-market revaluation of Hong Kong equities. The rise in foreign currency assets was mainly due to an increase in the month-end balances of unsettled purchase of securities and interest income from investments.

The Currency Board Account shows that the Monetary Base at the end of October 2025 was HK$2,026.7 billion, increased by HK$6.5 billion, or 0.3 per cent, from the end of September 2025. The increase was mainly due to the increase in the outstanding amount of Certificates of Indebtedness and the amortisation of discount on Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued.

The amount of Backing Assets increased by HK$9.0 billion, or 0.4 per cent, to HK$2,227.1 billion at the end of October 2025. The increase was mainly attributable to interest income from investments. The Backing Ratio increased from 109.80per cent at the end of September 2025 to 109.89per cent at the end of October 2025.

CHP announces one new melioidosis case,2025-11-28 16:30,2025-11-28 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800496.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (November 28) announced that one new melioidosis case was recorded in the past week (November 21 to 27). The CHP appealed to members of the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent melioidosis. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

The case involves a 73-year-old male with underlying illnesses living in Sham Shui Po. He presented with a fever and cough with sputum since November 17. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre on November 19 and was admitted for treatment. He is in stable condition. The clinical diagnosis was sepsis. His clinical sample was confirmed to be positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei upon testing.

  The CHP is investigating the infection source of the case. Initial epidemiological investigations revealed that the case is sporadic. No epidemiological linkages have been established between the case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of yesterday (November 27), 20 melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.


âThe CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. For more information on melioidosis, please visit the website of the CHP atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html."

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十一月二十八日）公布，截至二○二五年十月三十一日，外匯基金總資產為41,176億港元，較二○二五年九月底減少346億港元，其中港元資產減少926億港元，外幣資產則增加580億港元。

港元資產減少，主要是因為獲認購而未交收的外匯基金票據及債券的月底餘額減少及香港股票按市價重估。外幣資產增加，主要是因為已購入但未結算證券的月底餘額增加及來自投資的利息收入。

貨幣發行局帳目顯示，二○二五年十月底的貨幣基礎為20,267億港元，較二○二五年九月底增加65億港元，增幅為0.3%。貨幣基礎增加，主要是由於負債證明書總額增加及已發行外匯基金票據及債券的折價攤銷。

二○二五年十月底的支持資產總額增加90億港元至22,271億港元，增幅為0.4%。支持資產增加，主要是因為來自投資的利息收入。支持比率由二○二五年九月底的109.80%，上升至二○二五年十月底的109.89%。

衞生防護中心公布新增一宗類鼻疽個案,2025-11-28 16:30,2025-11-28 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800494.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十八日）表示，過去一星期（十一月二十一日至二十七日）錄得一宗新增類鼻疽個案。中心呼籲市民保持個人及環境衞生以預防類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的73歲男子。他居於深水埗區，自十一月十七日起出現發燒及咳嗽帶痰，於十一月十九日到明愛醫院急症室求診，並需留院接受治療，目前情況穩定。病人的臨床診斷為敗血症，臨床樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。

中心正調查個案的感染源頭，初步流行病學調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至昨日（十一月二十七日），本港今年錄得20宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"

二○二五年十月份貨幣統計數字,2025-11-28 16:30,2025-11-28 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800359.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

​香港金融管理局今日（十一月二十八日）發表的統計數字顯示，認可機構的存款總額在二○二五年十月份下跌0.4%，其中港元存款及外幣存款分別下跌0.9%及0.1%，主要反映企業資金流動。由年初截至十月底計，存款總額及港元存款分別上升9.7%及3.1%。香港人民幣存款在十月份下跌0.6%，於十月底為9,962億元人民幣。跨境貿易結算的人民幣匯款總額於十月份為10,066 億元人民幣，而九月份為11,232億元人民幣。存款變動受多項因素影響，包括利率走勢、市場集資活動等，因此適宜觀察較長期趨勢，毋須過度解讀個別月份的波動。

十月份貸款與墊款總額下跌0.7%，由年初截至十月底計則上升0.9%。其中在香港使用的貸款（包括貿易融資）及香港境外使用的貸款在十月份分別下跌0.9%及0.2%。由於港元貸款與港元存款跌幅相近，港元貸存比率於十月底大致維持不變，仍為73.6%。

十月份港元貨幣供應量M2及M3均下跌0.6%，與去年同期比較則均上升3.5%。十月份經季節因素調整的港元貨幣供應量M1上升1.7%，與去年同期比較上升12.2%，部分反映投資相關活動。貨幣供應量總額M2及M3於十月份均下跌0.3%，與去年同期比較，M2及M3則均上升10.6%。

由於按月貨幣統計數字或會受到各種短期因素（例如季節性的資金需求，以及營商與投資相關活動）影響而出現波動，因此應小心詮釋統計數字。"

二零二四年資訊及通訊、金融及保險、專業及商用服務業的業務表現及營運特色的主要統計數字,2025-11-28 16:30,2025-11-28 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/28/P2025112800377.htm,"根據政府統計處今日（十一月二十八日）發表二零二四年經濟活動按年統計調查─資訊及通訊、金融及保險、專業及商用服務業的結果，二零二四年金融業（銀行除外）錄得最大的總收益，其次為保險業，銀行業，資訊及通訊業，專業、科學及技術活動業，以及行政及支援服務活動業。

在金融業（銀行除外）方面，二零二四年的總收益達7,329億元，較二零二三年上升4.8%，而平均每間公司的總收益較二零二三年上升1.4%至7,310萬元。營運開支和僱員薪酬合共按年上升7.5%至二零二四年的3,573億元。該行業的盈餘總額（即總收益扣除營運開支、僱員薪酬及（如適用）貨品成本）較二零二三年上升2.4%至二零二四年的3,756億元，佔二零二四年總收益的51.3%。行業增加價值（投資及控股公司除外）較二零二三年上升13.3%至二零二四年的1,228億元。該行業增加價值可大致量度這行業對香港本地生產總值的貢獻。在二零二四年，從事金融業（銀行除外）的公司約有10 000間，從業人數約96 400人，平均每間公司的從業人數為9.6人。

在保險業方面，二零二四年的總收益達7,286億元，較二零二三年上升7.4%，而平均每間公司的總收益較二零二三年上升11.3%至2.691億元。營運開支和僱員薪酬合共按年上升12.9%至二零二四年的736億元。在二零二四年，從事保險業的公司約有2 700間，從業人數約83 000人，平均每間公司的從業人數為30.6人。

鑑於銀行業及保險業的業務經營特色，並沒有編製其盈餘總額及行業增加價值。政府統計處另行發布這兩個行業於本地生產總值的框架下編製的增加價值統計數字。同樣地，在金融業（銀行除外）的分類內，亦沒有編製投資及控股公司的行業增加價值。因此，該行業的行業增加價值數字並不包括投資及控股公司的增加價值。

在資訊及通訊業方面，二零二四年的總收益達2,591億元，較二零二三年上升2.8%，而平均每間公司的總收益較二零二三年輕微上升0.7%至2,250萬元。營運開支和僱員薪酬合共按年上升3.5%至二零二四年的1,797億元。該行業的盈餘總額較二零二三年下跌3.7%至二零二四年的588億元，佔二零二四年總收益的22.7%。行業增加價值較二零二三年上升1.8%至二零二四年的1,040億元。在二零二四年，從事資訊及通訊業的公司約有11 500間，從業人數約102 000人，平均每間公司的從業人數為8.9人。

在專業、科學及技術活動業方面，二零二四年的總收益達1,635億元，較二零二三年上升2.1%，而平均每間公司的總收益較二零二三年輕微上升0.8%至580萬元。營運開支和僱員薪酬合共按年上升3.0%至二零二四年的1,337億元。該行業的盈餘總額較二零二三年下跌1.3%至二零二四年的284億元，佔二零二四年總收益的17.4%。行業增加價值較二零二三年下跌1.9%至二零二四年的879億元。在二零二四年，從事專業、科學及技術活動業的公司約有28 400間，從業人數約153 600人，平均每間公司的從業人數為5.4人。

在行政及支援服務活動業方面，二零二四年的總收益達1,369億元，較二零二三年上升13.9%，而平均每間公司的總收益較二零二三年上升12.5%至1,190萬元。營運開支和僱員薪酬合共按年上升13.3%至二零二四年的1,237億元。該行業的盈餘總額較二零二三年上升20.4%至二零二四年的122億元，佔二零二四年總收益的8.9%。行業增加價值較二零二三年上升6.9%至二零二四年的645億元。在二零二四年，從事行政及支援服務活動業的公司約有11 500間，從業人數約236 200人，平均每間公司的從業人數為20.5人。

  Nine beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Big Wave Bay Beach
Repulse Bay Beach


Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Silver Mine Bay Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach


Golden Beach
Stanley Main Beach


Middle Bay Beach





Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, Silver Mine Bay Beach and Silverstrand Beach have been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on November 27 to noon today (November 28), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 241 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 52 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).
