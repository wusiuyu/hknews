CHP reminds public to avoid consuming raw oysters and undercooked bivalve shellfish for the time being to prevent norovirus infection,2026-02-11 19:00,2026-02-11 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100758.htm,"In view of the recent surge in norovirus food poisoning cases linked to the consumption of raw oysters, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (February 11) reiterated its call for the public to stay alert and maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. The public, especially the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with weakened immune systems, should refrain from consuming raw oysters and undercooked bivalve shellfish as they are at higher risk of developing complications (such as dehydration) if infected with norovirus.

""The number of food poisoning cases recorded over the past few weeks has continued to rise, increasing from an average of one case per week in late December to an average of four cases per week in January. From January 18 to February 10, the CHP recorded 39 food poisoning cases, affecting 44 males and 75 females aged between 15 and 75. Nearly 90 per cent (35 cases) were associated with norovirus, affecting 105 persons. Epidemiological investigations showed that all the individuals affected by the abovementioned food poisoning cases related to norovirus had consumed raw oysters during the incubation period. Six of them required hospitalisation. All are in stable condition. The CHP has notified the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of all food poisoning cases for appropriate follow-up and source tracing. Investigations are ongoing,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""As oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater, pathogens can accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Raw or undercooked oysters are considered a high-risk food. Persons who consume contaminated or undercooked oysters may contract food-borne diseases, such as norovirus, hepatitis A virus or other bacteria. During the Lunar New Year, people usually gather for meals with relatives and friends. I particularly remind the public that only thoroughly cooked food, especially shellfish, should be consumed, whether dining at home or in restaurants, to avoid contracting enteric diseases. Norovirus cannot be killed by alcoholic beverages, lemon juice or wasabi. When cooking oysters in a hot pot or on the grill, ensure that they are thoroughly cooked to effectively minimise the risk of norovirus infection. Given the recent increase in norovirus activity and epidemiological data indicating that most food poisoning cases are related to raw oyster consumption, the CFS of the FEHD is investigating the source of raw oysters. Hence, members of the public should not take the risk of consuming undercooked oysters,"" Dr Tsui explained.

""It is worth noting that norovirus is highly contagious. Individuals infected with norovirus through contaminated food can spread the virus to others through person-to-person contact or environment contaminated by vomitus. In addition to causing food poisoning, norovirus is also one of the primary causes of acute gastroenteritis (AGE). According to our surveillance data, the AGE activity level in Hong Kong has been rising since early January. The latest data showed that, as of February 10, a total of 38 AGE outbreaks in institutions and schools were recorded so far this year, involving 294 persons. Laboratory testing indicated that over 75 per cent of the outbreaks were caused by norovirus. Additionally, norovirus activity has increased in other popular travel destinations for Hong Kong citizens, including Japan and Korea. Surveillance data from Korea showed that the norovirus activity has reached its highest level in nearly five years for this time of year. Members of the public should remain vigilant and maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene when travelling abroad and pay attention to minimise the risk of infection,"" Dr Tsui added.

To prevent AGE and norovirus infection, members of the public should perform hand hygiene frequently. Since alcohol is not effective in killing norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water, especially before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet. Wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds. Then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer.

Members of the public may visit the CHP's dedicated webpages for the prevention of Norovirus Infection and Viral Gastroenteritis."

​Hong Kong Customs will continue to adopt innovative thinking in its development, strengthen co-operation with the industry, and steadfastly uphold the mission of safeguarding Hong Kong and facilitating legitimate trade."
Law and order situation in Hong Kong in 2025 (with photos),2026-02-11 18:35,2026-02-11 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100763.htm,"The law and order situation in Hong Kong in 2025 is as follows:

1. Overall situation

A total of 89 137 crimes were recorded in 2025, representing a decrease of 5.9% (-5 610 cases) compared with 2024. The number of violent crimes dropped by 15.9% (-1 662 cases) to 8 823 cases.

The vast majority of major crimes recorded decreases, including robbery, burglary, rape, indecent assault, wounding and serious assault, theft, criminal damage, blackmail, youth crime and triad-related crimes. Deception also registered a slight decrease (-2.9%).

Crimes that recorded increases included homicide, serious drug offences and missing motor vehicles.

2. Deception

Over the past few years, Police have stepped up efforts to combat deception. Although the number of cases remained high in 2025, totalling 43 212 cases, the figure represented a slight decrease of 2.9% (-1 268 cases) compared with 2024. This marked the first decline, following consecutive annual rises in deception figures since 2019. Monetary losses also decreased, dropping from approximately $9.2 billion to about $8.1 billion, a decline of 11.3% (-$1.03 billion).

Deception cases accounted for nearly half of all reported crimes (48.5%). Among the various categories, e-shopping fraud (12 505 cases, +946 cases, +8.2%) was the most prevalent, accounting for 28.9% of all deception cases. Police noted that e-shopping fraud related to concert tickets increased significantly following the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park in March 2025. A total of 2 805 cases were recorded last year, representing a year-on-year increase of 61.8% (+1 071 cases).

Online investment fraud accounted for the highest monetary loss, with 5 135 cases recorded, registering an increase of 30.7% (+1 205 cases). The total loss amount involved reached $3.58 billion, representing a rise of 58.4% (+$1.32 billion). While accounting for 11.9% of all deception cases, online investment fraud constituted 44.1% of the total monetary loss, with the average loss per case rising from about $580,000 in 2024 to about $700,000 in 2025.

There were 4 095 cases of online employment fraud, an increase of 6.3% (+242 cases). Most of these were “click farming” scams (96.5%), in which fraudsters falsely claimed that commissions could be earned by making advance payments to boost sales figures. In contrast, telephone deception recorded 8 621 cases, a decrease of 6.3% (-583 cases). This decline included a 20.4% drop in telephone deception cases involving “impersonating customer service”, a tactic that first appeared in 2024, which accounted for 4 440 cases (-1 135 cases). Phishing scams and “compensated dating scams” recorded 1 093 cases (-1 638 cases) and 1 122 cases (-907 cases) respectively, registering a 60% and 44.7% drop.

Four major strategies

Fraudulent activities have become highly industrialised, characterised by a sophisticated division of labour and a cross-border nature. To combat these scams, both local measures and cross-border collaboration are indispensable. Accordingly, Police have formulated four major strategic directions.

Combating fraud industry chains

The first strategy focuses on dismantling fraud industry chains. The priority is to tackle the use of telecommunications networks for fraudulent purposes at the source. In June 2025, the Hong Kong Police Force conducted a joint operation with its Singaporean counterpart, arresting eight persons suspected of using 400 000 Hong Kong mobile SIM cards to generate massive volumes of scam calls. In response, the working group established by Police, the Office of the Communications Authority and the telecommunications sector has been actively studying and implementing various countermeasures. Notably, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau will submit a legislative proposal in 2026, which includes lowering the registration limit for pre-paid SIM cards per user and introducing new offences targeting their improper use.

To tackle the downstream activities of fraud industry chains, Police are prioritising the crackdown on stooge accounts used to collect illicit proceeds. Apart from strengthening enforcement, expediting prosecutions and seeking enhanced sentencing, Police and the banking sector are actively exploring ways to prevent the opening of stooge accounts. With the new legislation allowing bank-to-bank information sharing on suspicious personal accounts coming into effect in late 2025, and the official launch of the upgraded version of the Police-bank information sharing platform, FINEST, on December 15, 2025, interbank information sharing has recorded a multi-fold increase. Participation is also set to expand from 10 to all 28 retail banks.

Furthermore, Police partnered with the banking sector to launch the “Upstream Scam Intervention” scheme in 2023. By analysing the transaction patterns of stooge accounts, officers proactively contacted potential victims to dissuade them from transferring further funds to fraudsters. In 2025, Police successfully intervened in 4 060 deception cases (+69.4%) and intercepted fraudulent payments totalling $480 million, representing a more than 1.5-fold increase (+158.4%) compared with 2024. The total monetary loss from deception cases in 2025 fell by $1.03 billion, with the successful interventions under this scheme accounting for nearly half of the decline.

In addition to combating stooge accounts, the Virtual Asset Intelligence Taskforce, mentioned in last year’s Policy Address, was established in October 2025. Chairing the taskforce, Police will strengthen intelligence exchange with the Customs and Excise Department, regulators, and industry partners to jointly combat virtual asset-related crimes. Key priorities include optimising the stop-payment mechanism to further clamp down on criminals using cryptocurrency to collect crime proceeds and launder money.

Targeted publicity

The second major direction is targeted publicity aimed at achieving precision in scam prevention. Last year, Police identified Mainland students and the elderly as key targets for publicity and allocated more resources to enhance the anti-scam awareness of these two high-risk groups.

The monetary loss incurred by Mainland students in telephone deception was 2.9 times higher than that of local students, averaging approximately $690,000 and $176,000 respectively. In response, Police carried out extensive publicity and educational work in 2025 to prevent Mainland students from falling victim to telephone deception. These efforts included conducting surveys, seminars, and arranging campus visits by the anti-scam icecream van, etc. Through these year-long efforts, Police noted an improvement in the situation regarding their involvement in telephone deception. The number of cases and the amount of loss decreased by 9.2% and 16.9% respectively.

However, it was also observed that the number of cases and the amount of loss involving Mainland students in investment fraud surged by 3.6 times (+362.5%) and 6.5 times (+649.6%) respectively. For the general public as a whole, the total loss from online investment fraud was the highest among all deception categories (accounting for 44.1%). Therefore, Police will adjust the key publicity focus in 2026 by shifting the priority from Mainland students to combatting investment fraud, with a view to deploying resources flexibly to maximise crime prevention effectiveness.

Separately, online investment fraud caused substantial losses, with one-third ($1.18 billion) involving virtual assets. Many victims incurred losses after downloading fake mobile applications created by fraudsters and depositing funds for investment. To counter this modus operandi, relevant prevention tips have been provided on “Scameter+”, and Police will continue to conduct targeted publicity.

Furthermore, in 80% (80.4%) of investment fraud cases, victims were contacted by fraudsters via individual mainstream social media platforms and instant messaging applications. Police will enhance communication with the relevant companies, expecting them not only to co-operate more effectively with police investigations by providing information and removing fraudulent accounts and posts, but also to be more proactive in identifying suspicious accounts and posts to expedite blocking.

Regarding the elderly, the number of victims has risen across various categories of deception. In particular, “Guess Who” telephone deception saw both the number of cases and the amount of loss surge by over 50% (+58.1% and +52.8% respectively). As many elderly victims were swindled out of their savings and pensions, Police will continue to prioritise the elderly in its publicity efforts, including organising a series of anti-deception activities and producing and broadcasting promotional videos.

Promoting greater use of “Scameter+”

Thirdly, Police will intensify the promotion of “Scameter+”. Although downloads reached 1.15 million by the end of 2025, the penetration rate still leaves room for improvement. Consequently, Police launched new features for “Scameter+” in October 2025, including automatic user database updates and expanded reporting categories covering SMS and instant messaging applications. New artificial intelligence technology was also introduced to analyse suspicious website links and webpage screenshots reported by the public to detect the impersonation of banks, couriers, investment platforms and others. Once confirmed as malicious, these websites are instantly added to the database to block access for all users.

Following the launch of these new features, public reports of suspicious phone numbers and websites surged by about 60% and about 50% respectively; the number of suspicious phone numbers and websites added to the database doubled; furthermore, “Scameter+” proactively identified and blocked 267 scam domains not yet reported by the public. Compared to the pre-upgrade period, the number of searches on “Scameter+” rose by 17.6%, while alerts issued by the app surged by 66.5%, exceeding 130 000 in December 2025 alone. Police also requested telecommunications operators to intercept suspicious calls and websites. This timely intervention prevented the public from accessing fraudulent messages and led to a significant drop in phishing scams (-60%).

International collaboration

Police are actively promoting and participating in international co-operation to combat cross-border fraud more effectively. To this end, Police established the Cross-border Anti-Scam Collaboration Platform, “FRONTIER+”, with various countries/regions at the end of 2024. Its first joint operation in 2025 resulted in over 1 800 arrests.

The platform now comprises 13 members. Police will continue inviting other countries/regions to join, with a view to enhancing effectiveness in intelligence exchange, interception of scam proceeds and joint enforcement actions. While attending the INTERPOL General Assembly in Morocco in late November 2025, the Commissioner of Police held in-depth discussions with representatives from various countries to explore ways to strengthen co-operation. As the 2026 General Assembly will be held in Hong Kong for the first time, Police will seize the opportunity to strengthen collaboration and exchanges with different countries and regions to jointly tackle cross-border crimes.

3. Homicide

There were 194 cases of homicide, including the 168 deaths caused by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, which was classified as manslaughter. Police have so far arrested 16 persons for manslaughter in connection with the fire.

Of the remaining 26 cases, 16 (61.5%) involved domestic or family violence, compared with 10 such cases in 2024. Among all cases, only one case remained undetected; this involved a 49-year-old non-ethnic Chinese (NEC) woman who was killed in June 2025. Police are making every effort to bring the suspect, who remains at large, to justice.

4. Wounding and serious assault

There were 3 363 cases of wounding and serious assault, representing a decrease of 6.9% (-251 cases). Of these, 8.3% were triad-related. Police paid particular attention to cases involving triads and NEC persons (i.e. the number of NEC persons arrested for wounding and serious assault), which decreased by 10.3% and 9% respectively.

5. Robbery

There were 66 robbery cases, a decrease of 26.7% (-24 cases). This marked the lowest figure since records began in 1969, averaging one case every 5.5 days. The detection rate reached a high of 90.9%.

During the period, there were no robberies involving genuine firearms or stun guns. One bank robbery and two robberies involving large amounts of cash were all detected within a short period. With the aid of closed-circuit television (CCTV), an important investigative tool, and the dedicated and persistent investigation by Police officers, Police swiftly identified the suspects and successfully arrested them.

Intelligence work was also crucial to Police’s effective combat against robbery. In November 2025, acting on intelligence, Police laid an ambush in Hung Hom and arrested eight suspects attempting to rob the victims of 38 kg of gold dust with beef knives.

6. Burglary

A total of 816 burglary cases were recorded, representing a decrease of 33.1% (-404 cases). This was also a new historical low since 1969.

In 2025, Police began deploying drones for anti-burglary operations on high-risk days during long holidays. Consequently, burglary figures during the Easter and summer holidays dropped by 50% and 30.2% respectively. During the recent Christmas period, Police continued these operations, resulting in a 23.9% decrease in cases. Moving forward, Police will continue to deploy drones for anti-burglary operations during long holidays, such as the Chinese New Year.

7. Theft

A total of 20 032 theft cases were recorded, representing a decline of 10.7% (-2 401 cases). Most categories recorded decreases, including miscellaneous theft (-9.7%) and shop theft (-9.6%), while pickpocketing saw a significant drop of 56.3%. Notably, the figures for snatching (-23.4%) and theft from vehicles (-17.2%) reached their lowest levels since records began in 1969 and 1977 respectively.

Missing motor vehicles, however, recorded an increase. A total of 440 vehicles were involved, registering an increase of 51 vehicles (+13.1%). Half of these cases (220 vehicles) occurred in New Territories North (NTN) , an area characterised by its vast coverage and numerous rural and remote locations. Private cars and motorcycles accounted for over 80% (81.6%) of the total. Among the 440 missing motor vehicles, 24.1% were unauthorised use of vehicles taken from family members, friends, or car rental companies, etc.; 10.5% were taken for driving without a driving licence; and another 11.1% were used for committing crimes, primarily drug trafficking. Overall, 60.2% of the missing motor vehicles were recovered.

To combat the rise in vehicle theft, Police conducted multiple intelligence-led operations last year, arresting 44 persons and recovering 28 missing motor vehicles. Since July 2025, Police have also deployed drones to conduct aerial patrols at black spots for vehicle theft in NTN to enhance deterrence. Following months of enforcement actions, the increase in missing motor vehicle figures has gradually narrowed, slowing from a 53.5% increase in the first half of 2025 to a 13.1% increase for the whole year.

8. Blackmail

A total of 1 674 blackmail cases were recorded, representing a decrease of 44.8% (-1 357 cases). Of these, 78.4% were related to “naked chat” (1 312 cases), representing a drop of 46.1% (-1 122 cases).

Police noted that the proportion of students among victims rose from 18.7% in 2024 to 27.4%. In view of this, Police continued to enhance publicity and education efforts, including the publication of a new edition of the Youth Crime Prevention Booklet in September 2025, and the release of “Letters to Parents” on the “CyberDefender” website covering topics such as online child sexual grooming and the prevention of online sextortion.

9. Sexual offences

There were 68 rape cases, a decrease of nine cases (-11.7%). The detection rate stood at 95.6%. During the period, there was one case involving a stranger, which was detected.

A total of 1 137 cases of indecent assault were recorded, representing a drop of 48 cases (-4.1%). The detection rate was 78.9%.

Police have been closely monitoring the situation regarding sexual offences and no specific trend has been observed at this stage.

10. Serious drug offences

There were 1 281 serious drug cases, representing an increase of 15% (+167 cases). Cases involving etomidate accounted for 29.4% (376 cases).

Etomidate has become the most commonly abused drug overall and among youths, followed by cocaine and cannabis. Since etomidate was listed as a dangerous drug in February 2025, Police recorded 911 cases involving etomidate by the end of the year, resulting in 1 134 arrests, including 205 youths.

By the end of 2025, sentences had been handed down in 47 etomidate cases. Of these, 41 were cases of “possession of a dangerous drug”, with a maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment, while the remaining six were cases of “trafficking in a dangerous drug”, resulting in imprisonment terms of up to 24 months. Police will closely monitor court sentences and maintain close communication with the Department of Justice to explore seeking appropriate sentencing guidelines from the court for etomidate as an emerging drug.

In August 2025, Police launched a 24-hour etomidate reporting hotline (6629 2966) as well as WhatsApp and WeChat accounts, which received 54 reports by the end of the year. The Government has also included etomidate in the “Healthy School Programme” for the 2025/26 school year to assist schools with early identification and the provision of counselling and support.

Believing that prevention is better than cure, Police will continue efforts in anti-drug education. In 2025, Police held 32 seminars and set up booths to share the latest anti-drug information with nearly 30 000 teachers. In 2026, Police will tour primary schools across various districts to stage 60 anti-drug drama performances. Furthermore, the Leadership Institute on Narcotics has launched its fifth cohort, receiving applications from 67 secondary schools, the highest number in the programme's history.

11. Triad-related crimes

A total of 1 944 triad-related crimes were recorded, representing a decrease of 16.4% (-381 cases).

Police remain committed to combating triad activities by mounting enforcement and intelligence-led operations, focusing specifically on targeting triad sources of income. In 2025, Police conducted the annual “THUNDERBOLT” operation in collaboration with the police authorities of Guangdong and Macao. A total of 4 140 persons were arrested in Hong Kong, with the seizure of cash and drugs worth approximately $550 million.

Separately, after several years of investigation and evidence gathering, Police conducted an enforcement operation in July 2025, arresting 82 members of a triad syndicate, including the ringleader, his family members and accomplices. During the operation, over $8 million in cash was seized, and illicit funds amounting to $1.13 billion were frozen. Subsequently, in August, Police dismantled the syndicate's organised cross-border prostitution operation and arrested 67 persons, including over 40 sex workers from various places. Police operations are ongoing.

12. Youth crime

In 2025, a total of 2 662 youths were arrested for criminal offences, representing a decrease of 6.3% (-178 persons). This marked the lowest figure on record since 1990, indicating that Police and various community sectors had achieved tangible results through sustained efforts to prevent and combat youth crime.

13. Relevant situation of national security

Since the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance came into force, the National Security Department of Police had arrested a total of 385 persons as at the end of 2025. More than half of them had been charged.

14. Conclusion

  In 2025, the overall crime figure registered a drop (-5.9%). The vast majority of major crimes recorded decreases; in particular, the figures for robbery (-26.7%) and burglary (-33.1%) were the lowest on record.

Following the implementation of the SmartView project, the detection rates for various street crimes rose by 2.5 to 22.8 percentage points, while crime figures dropped by 3.1% to 71.8%. This demonstrates that the SmartView project has had a highly positive impact on crime prevention and detection, contributing to the continued stability of Hong Kong’s overall law and order situation.

2025年香港整體治安情況（附圖）,2026-02-11 18:27,2026-02-11 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100756.htm,"2025年香港整體治安情況如下：

1. 整體形勢

2025年，全港共錄得89 137宗罪案，較2024年下跌5.9%（-5 610宗），暴力罪案有8 823宗，跌15.9%（-1 662宗）。

絕大部分的主要罪案錄得下跌，如行劫、爆竊、強姦、非禮、傷人及嚴重毆打、盜竊、刑事毀壞、勒索、青少年及三合會相關罪案等。詐騙案亦輕微下跌（-2.9%）。

錄得上升的罪案有兇殺、嚴重毒品罪行及失車。

2. 詐騙案

警隊於過去數年致力打擊詐騙案，雖然2025年的案件數字仍然高企，共43 212宗，但較2024年輕微下跌2.9%（-1 268宗），這亦是自2019年詐騙案數字逐年上升後首次下跌。損失金額亦錄得跌幅，由約92億元減少至約81億元，跌11.3%（-10.3億元）。

詐騙案佔整體罪案近一半（48.5%），各分類中佔最多為網上購物騙案，有12 505宗，上升946宗（+8.2%），佔28.9%。警方留意到自啟德體育園在去年三月開幕，涉及演唱會門票的網購騙案明顯增加，去年共有2 805宗，按年升61.8%（+1 071宗）。

損失金額最高是網上投資騙案，有5 135宗，升30.7%（+1 205宗），涉及損失達35.8億元，升58.4%（+13.2億元）。網上投資騙案佔整體騙案11.9%，但損失金額佔44.1%，平均每宗案件的損失由2024年的58萬元升至2025年的70萬元。

網上求職騙案有4 095宗，升6.3%（+242宗），大多數為「刷單」騙案（96.5%），即騙徒訛稱先付款「刷單」購物可賺佣金。至於電話騙案則有8 621宗，跌6.3%（-583宗），其中於2024年開始出現的「假冒客服」手法跌20.4%（-1 135宗）至4 440宗。釣魚騙案及「援交騙案」分別佔1 093宗（-1 638宗）及1 122宗（-907宗），跌幅分別為60%及44.7%。

四大策略

詐騙活動高度產業化，分工細密，且具跨境特性。要打擊騙案，本地措施與跨境協作缺一不可。因此，警隊已訂立四大方向：

打擊詐騙產業鏈

第一是打擊詐騙產業鏈。首先要從源頭打擊利用電訊網絡行騙。香港警方與新加坡警方於2025年六月進行聯合行動，拘捕八人，涉嫌以40萬張香港電話卡打出大量詐騙電話行騙。因此，警方與通訊事務管理局辦公室及業界成立的工作小組一直不斷研究並實施不同措施，包括商務及經濟發展局將於2026年內提交立法建議，包括降低個人登記電話儲值卡數目的上限，及訂立新罪行打擊不當使用電話卡。

針對產業鏈的下游部分，警隊重點打擊用作收取騙款的傀儡戶口。除了加強執法、加快檢控、加重刑罰外，警方與銀行業界積極探討如何防止開立傀儡戶口。隨着容許銀行分享可疑個人帳戶資料的新法例於2025年年底生效，以及警方與銀行業界的訊息交換平台FINEST升級版於去年十二月十五日正式推出，銀行間的信息共享錄得倍數上升，參與的銀行數目亦即將由10間擴展至所有28間零售銀行。

警方自2023年起與銀行聯手推出「騙案預警」計劃，透過分析傀儡戶口的交易，主動聯絡潛在詐騙受害人，說服他們停止繼續轉帳予騙徒。2025年，警方成功勸阻4 060宗騙案（+69.4%），阻截騙款達4.8億元，較2024年升超過1.5倍（+158.4%）。2025年整體騙案的損失金額下跌10.3億元，即近一半的跌幅來自此計劃成功減少的損失。

除打擊傀儡戶口外，去年《施政報告》提及的虛擬資產情報工作組已於2025年十月成立。作為工作組主席，警方會透過工作組強化與海關、監管機構及業界的情報交流，共同打擊虛擬資產相關罪案，重點包括優化止付流程，進一步打擊罪犯以加密貨幣收取贓款及清洗黑錢。

重點宣傳

第二個大方向是重點宣傳，以達致精準防騙。警隊於去年將內地學生及長者定為重點宣傳對象，投放較多資源提升此兩個高危群組的防騙意識。

內地學生在電話騙案中的損失金額較本地生高2.9倍，平均分別約為69萬元及17.6萬元。因此，警方在2025年以預防內地生成為電話騙案受害人進行大量宣傳教育工作，包括進行問卷調查、舉辦講座、安排防騙雪糕車入校園等。經過整年努力，警方留意到內地生涉及電話騙案的情況有所改善，案件數字及損失金額分別跌9.2%及16.9%。

然而，警方同時留意到內地生涉及投資騙案的案件數字及損失金額分別急升3.6倍（+362.5%）及6.5倍（+649.6%）；就廣大市民而言，網上投資騙案的總損失亦為各騙案類別中最高（佔44.1%）。因此，警隊2026年將調整重點宣傳項目，以投資騙案取代內地生作重點宣傳目標，務求靈活運用資源，達到最大防罪效果。

另外，網上投資騙案的損失龐大，當中三分一（11.8億元）涉及虛擬資產，不少受害人下載騙徒製作的虛假流動應用程式，存入款項進行投資，招致損失。針對這類手法，「防騙視伏App」已提供相關防騙「貼士」，警方會繼續作重點宣傳。

此外，投資騙案當中，八成（80.4%）受害人經個別主流社交媒體平台和即時通訊軟件遭騙徒接觸，警方會加強與有關公司溝通，希望它們除了更好配合警方調查，提供資料及將詐騙帳戶及帖文下架外，亦應更主動辨識可疑帳戶及帖文，加快作出封鎖。

至於長者方面，由於他們在多個騙案類別中被騙的數字均有所上升，尤其在「猜猜我是誰」電話騙案中，案件數字及損失金額均升超過五成（分別+58.1%及+52.8%），不少長者更被騙去積蓄及退休金，因此，警隊會維持以長者作為重點宣傳對象，舉辦連串的防騙活動、製作及播放宣傳片等。

加強使用「防騙視伏App」

第三，警方會加強推廣「防騙視伏App」。雖然「防騙視伏App」的下載量至2025年底已達115萬，但滲透率仍有待加強。因此，警方於2025年十月推出新功能，包括自動更新用戶的數據庫、新增舉報種類，包括SMS短訊、即時通訊軟件等。全新的人工智能技術亦會透過分析市民舉報的可疑網址及網站截圖，偵測假冒的銀行、速遞、投資平台等，並將有關網頁即時納入資料庫，為所有用戶作出封鎖。

在新功能推出後，公眾舉報的可疑電話號碼及網址數量分別大增約60%及一半；納入資料庫的可疑電話號碼及網址數量升一倍，更主動找出267個仍未有市民舉報的詐騙域名並進行封鎖。「防騙視伏App」的搜尋次數較升級前升17.6%，發出警示的數字更升66.5%，單在2025年十二月已經超過13萬次。警方亦會要求電訊商攔截可疑電話號碼及網址，及時阻止市民接觸到詐騙訊息，釣魚騙案亦因而大幅下跌（-60%）。

國際合作

警方一直積極推動和參與國際合作，以更有效打擊跨境詐騙。就此，警隊於2024年底與多個國家／地區成立反詐騙跨境合作平台「FRONTIER+」，2025年首次進行聯合行動，拘捕超過1 800人。

現時平台成員已增加至13個，警方會繼續邀請其他國家／地區加入，以加強在情報交流、攔截騙款及聯合執法方面的成效。警務處處長於2025年十一月底在摩洛哥出席國際刑警組織周年大會期間，亦與不同國家的代表深入交流，探討如何加強合作。2026年的周年大會將首次在香港舉行，警隊會抓緊機會強化與不同國家和地區的聯動和交流，共同打擊跨境犯罪。

3. 兇殺案

兇殺案有194宗，當中包括被列作誤殺案的大埔宏福苑火災中的168名死者。警方就此火災至今拘捕16人，涉嫌誤殺。

餘下26宗案件中，16宗（佔61.5%）涉及家庭或親屬暴力，而2024年有10宗類似案件。所有案件中，只有一宗未被偵破，涉及在2025年六月遇害的49歲非華裔女子，警方正全力追緝已潛逃的疑兇歸案。

4. 傷人及嚴重毆打

傷人及嚴重毆打案共3 363宗，跌6.9%（-251宗）。當中8.3%與三合會有關。警方尤其關注涉及三合會及非華裔人士的案件（即因傷人及嚴重毆打案而被捕的非華裔人數），分別跌10.3%及9%。

5. 行劫

行劫案共66宗，跌26.7%（-24宗）。數字是自1969年有紀錄以來最低，平均每5.5日一宗，而破案率則高達90.9%。

期內沒有涉及真槍或電槍的劫案，一宗在銀行發生及兩宗涉及大額現金的劫案均在短時間內破案。透過閉路電視這重要的偵查工具，以及警務人員鍥而不捨的追查，警方迅速鎖定疑犯身分，並成功將他們拘捕。

情報工作亦是警隊有效打擊劫案的關鍵。2025年十一月，警方透過情報搜集，預先在紅磡區埋伏，拘捕八名企圖以牛肉刀搶劫38公斤金粉的疑犯。

6. 爆竊

爆竊案共816宗，跌33.1%（-404宗），同樣是自1969年以來歷史新低。

警方於2025年長假期爆竊案多發的日子，開始利用無人機隊展開反爆竊行動。復活節及暑假期間的爆竊案數字分別跌一半及30.2%。而在剛過去的聖誕節，警方繼續採取這類行動，爆竊案亦跌23.9%。未來警方會繼續在農曆新年等長假期使用無人機進行反爆竊行動。

7. 盜竊

盜竊案有20 032宗，跌10.7%（-2 401宗），大部分的類別錄得下跌，包括雜項盜竊（-9.7%）、店鋪盜竊（-9.6%），扒竊大跌56.3%；而搶掠（-23.4%）及車內盜竊（-17.2%）更分別是自1969年及1977年有紀錄以來最低。

失車案錄得上升，共涉及440輛車，上升51輛（+13.1%），一半案件（220輛）發生於面積大及有不少鄉郊及偏僻地區的新界北。私家車及電單車佔超過八成（81.6 %）。在440輛失車中，24.1%屬於「技術性失車」，即擅取家人、朋友或租車公司等的車輛；10.5%用作無牌駕駛；另外11.1%被用作犯案，主要為販毒。整體而言，60.2%的失車已被尋獲。

針對偷車上升，警方去年進行多個情報主導行動，共拘捕44人，起回28輛失車。警方亦自2025年七月起利用無人機在新界北的偷車黑點進行高空巡邏，加強阻嚇力。經過警方的連月打擊，失車數字的升幅已逐步收窄，由2025年上半年的53.5%升幅逐步收窄至全年13.1%升幅。

8. 勒索

勒索案有1 674宗，跌44.8%（-1 357宗），當中78.4%為「裸聊」（1 312宗），跌46.1%（-1 122宗）。

警方留意到學生佔受害人的比例由2024年的18.7%升至27.4%。就此，警方繼續加強宣傳教育工作，包括在2025年九月出版新一期《青少年罪行誌．師長攻略》，及於「守網者」網站推出「給家長的信」，內容涵蓋兒童網上性誘識及提防網上性勒索等議題。

9. 性罪行

強姦案有68宗 ，跌九宗（-11.7%），破案率達95.6%。期內有一宗涉及陌生人的案件，已被偵破。

非禮案有1 137宗，跌48宗（-4.1%），破案率達78.9%。

警方一直密切留意性罪行的情況，現時未見有特定趨勢。

10. 嚴重毒品罪行

嚴重毒品案有1 281宗，升15%（+167宗），涉及依托咪酯的案件佔29.4%（376宗）。

依托咪酯已成為整體及青少年最常吸食的毒品，其次為可卡因和大麻。自依托咪酯於2025年二月被列為毒品後，截至年底，警方錄得911宗涉及依托咪酯的案件，共拘捕1 134人，包括205名青少年。

截至2025年底，共有47宗依托咪酯案判刑，當中41宗為「管有危險藥物」案，最高判監六個月，餘下六宗為「販運危險藥物」案，最高判監24個月。警方會密切留意法庭判刑，並與律政司保持緊密溝通，研究要求法庭為依托咪酯作為新興毒品訂立合適的判刑指引。

警方自2025年八月起增設打擊依托咪酯的24小時舉報熱線（6629 2966）、WhatsApp及微信帳號，至年底接獲54宗舉報。政府亦已於2025/26學年將依托咪酯納入「健康校園計劃」，協助學校及早識別個案，以提供輔導及支援。

預防勝於治療，警方會繼續做好禁毒教育工作，2025年共舉辦32場講座、設置攤位，向近3萬名教師講解最新的禁毒資訊。2026年內，警方將到各區小學舉辦60場禁毒劇場。另外，「禁毒領袖學院」亦已經舉辦至第五屆，共67間中學報名，破歷屆紀錄。

11. 三合會相關罪行

三合會相關罪行有1 944宗，跌16.4%（-381宗）。

警方致力打擊三合會活動，開展執法及情報主導行動，重點打擊三合會的收入來源。警方2025年亦聯同廣東省和澳門，展開一年一度的「雷霆」行動，港方共拘捕4 140人，檢獲現金、毒品等，總值約5.5億元。

另外，警方經數年的調查搜集大量證據，於2025年七月進行收網行動，拘捕一個黑社會團伙共82人，當中包括該社團的頭目、家人及黨羽，並於行動中檢獲800多萬港元現金，凍結11.3億元黑錢。其後，警方於八月搗破該團伙的有組織跨境賣淫活動，拘捕67人，包括40多名來自多地的性工作者。警方的行動仍然繼續。

12. 青少年罪行

2025年，共2 662名青少年因刑事罪行而被捕，跌6.3%（-178人）。數字是自1990年有紀錄以來最低，可見警隊與各界在持續推展青少年防罪滅罪工作方面有一定成效。

13. 國家安全相關情況

自《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》生效後，截至2025年底，警方國安處共拘捕385人，超過一半已被檢控。

14. 總結

  2025年整體罪案數字有所下跌（-5.9%），絕大部分主要罪案錄得跌幅，當中行劫（-26.7%）及爆竊（-33.1%）更是有紀錄以來最低。

推行「銳眼」計劃後，多類在街道上發生的案件的破案率分別升2.5至22.8個百分點不等，罪案數字則跌3.1%至71.8%不等，可見「銳眼」計劃為防罪滅罪帶來十分正面的作用，香港整體治安情況更趨平穩。

​香港海關偵破兩宗大型海路走私案件並檢獲約六千八百萬元懷疑私煙（附圖）,2026-02-11 18:15,2026-02-11 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100659.htm,"香港海關近日展開執法行動打擊大型海路走私香煙活動，於一月三十一日及二月四日偵破兩宗案件，檢獲共約一千五百二十二萬支懷疑未完稅香煙，估計市值約六千八百萬元，應課稅值約五千萬元，並拘捕八名男子。

首宗案件中，海關於一月三十一日在南丫島西北水域截查一首可疑遠洋貨船。經搜查後，海關人員在船上四個空載貨櫃的暗格內檢獲約七百六十二萬支懷疑私煙，並拘捕八名年齡介乎二十一至五十九歲的懷疑涉案非本地男子，包括一名船長和七名船員。被捕船長已被落案控以「輸入未列艙單貨物」罪。

第二宗案件中，海關透過風險評估和情報分析，於二月四日在葵涌海關大樓驗貨場揀選及查驗一個由中國台灣抵港，報稱載有襪子的四十呎貨櫃。經檢查後，海關人員在貨櫃內檢獲約七百六十萬支懷疑私煙。

上述案件仍在調查中，海關會繼續追查私煙的來源和去向，不排除會有更多人被捕。

海關相信農曆新年臨近，私煙集團意圖囤積大量私煙以供應本地及海外市場。是次行動充份展示海關從源頭打擊私煙的執法成效。海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。

海關強調，走私屬嚴重罪行。根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。此外，根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Hong Kong Customs detects two large-scale sea smuggling cases and seizes suspected illicit cigarettes worth about $68 million (with photos),2026-02-11 18:15,2026-02-11 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100660.htm,"Hong Kong Customs recently mounted enforcement operations to combat large-scale illicit cigarette smuggling activities by sea and detected two cases on January 31 and February 4, during which a total of about 15.22 million suspected illicit cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $68 million and a duty potential of about $50 million were seized. Eight men were arrested.

In the first case, Customs on January 31 intercepted a suspicious ocean-going cargo vessel in the northwestern waters off Lamma Island. Upon inspection, Customs officers seized about 7.62 million suspected illicit cigarettes concealed inside the false compartments built within four empty containers onboard the vessel. Eight non-local men, aged between 21 and 59, suspected to be connected with the case were arrested, comprising a captain and seven crew members. The arrested captain was charged with importing unmanifested cargoes.

In the second case, through risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Customs officers on February 4 selected for inspection a 40-foot container, declared as carrying socks and arriving from Taiwan, China, at the Kwai Chung Customhouse Cargo Examination Compound. Upon inspection, Customs officers seized about 7.6 million suspected illicit cigarettes inside the container.

Investigations of the cases are ongoing. Customs will continue to trace the source and flow of the illicit cigarettes. The likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

Customs believes that, with the imminent arrival of the Lunar New Year, cigarette smuggling syndicates attempted to stockpile large quantities of illicit cigarettes to supply both local and overseas markets. The operation results demonstrate the effectiveness of Customs' enforcement strategy in combating cigarette smuggling at source. Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. In addition, under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

In the 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive emphasised that the Government would sustain its efforts in promoting youth development on all fronts. This includes continuing to implement various exchange and internship programmes on the Mainland and overseas to help young people broaden international horizons and cultivate a holistic outlook. In this regard, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau forged partnerships with large corporates to launch the HYAB Scheme on Corporate Summer Internship on the Mainland and Overseas for Hong Kong youth to intern at the Mainland and overseas operations of these corporates. The Scheme will help young people learn and experience first-hand the national development and international trends, and at the same time provide them with exposure to the work culture in large corporates and the opportunity to establish interpersonal networks outside Hong Kong, enabling them to accumulate invaluable work experience and lay a foundation for future career development.

The number of companies participating in the new round of the Scheme has increased to 29. Internship placements are offered in multiple Chinese Mainland provinces and cities, including various Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Chongqing and Hangzhou, as well as overseas countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Australia. The internship placements also cover a wider range of industries than before, such as financial services, innovation and technology, pharmaceutical, logistics, property development, construction, retail, hospitality and utilities (please refer to Annex for details of the internship placements). Applicants must be aged 18 or above and should be (i) a full time post-secondary student (including sub-degree, undergraduate, or postgraduate) holding a Hong Kong permanent identity card; or (ii) a local full-time post-secondary student (including sub-degree, undergraduate, or postgraduate) holding a Hong Kong identity card. The internship will take place between June and September this year. Participating companies will sponsor the interns for major expenses including transportation and accommodation costs, and assign dedicated personnel to provide training and support to the interns.

Details of the Scheme are available on the dedicated webpage (www.ydc.gov.hk/scsi/en). Interested young people should submit their applications through the centralised application platform on the dedicated webpage on or before March 9. Each person can apply for up to three companies in one application. Upon receiving the applications, participating companies will contact suitable applicants directly for the assessment and selection process, and make placement arrangements for selected interns."

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-11 17:30,2026-02-11 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100635.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 11), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 33, at Hong Kong International Airport on February 9 and seized about 22 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $91,000 and a duty potential of about $75,000, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

衞生防護中心提醒市民現時不要進食生蠔及未經煮熟的雙殼類海產　避免感染諾如病毒,2026-02-11 17:20,2026-02-11 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100675.htm,"鑑於近期與進食生蠔相關的諾如病毒食物中毒個案大幅上升，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月十一日）再次呼籲市民提高警覺，時刻保持個人、食物及環境衞生，現時不應進食生蠔及未經煮熟的雙殼類海產，特別是長者、孕婦和小童及免疫力弱的人士，因他們感染諾如病毒後有較大機會出現併發症（例如脫水）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「過去數周錄得的食物中毒個案持續增加，由去年十二月底每周錄得平均一宗個案，上升至一月每周平均四宗。一月十八日至二月十日，中心已錄得39宗食物中毒個案，共影響44男和75女，年齡介於15至75歲。其中，近九成（35宗）與諾如病毒相關，涉及105人。流行病學調查發現上述與諾如病毒相關的食物中毒個案的受影響人士全部在潛伏期內曾食用生蠔。受影響人士當中，有六人須留院治理，全部情況穩定。中心已將全部食物中毒個案通知食物環境衞生署食物安全中心作適當跟進及追查來源，調查仍在進行。」

徐樂堅醫生解釋：「由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有病原體，這些物質便會在蠔的體內積聚。生或未徹底煮熟的蠔是高風險食物，進食受污染及未經煮熟的蠔，可能感染經由食物傳染的疾病，例如諾如病毒、甲型肝炎病毒或其他細菌。農曆新年期間，市民很多時會與親友聚餐，我特別提醒市民，無論是在家或光顧食肆，應進食徹底煮熟食物，特別是貝類，以避免感染腸道疾病。酒精飲料、檸檬汁或芥末亦不能殺死諾如病毒。以火鍋或炭燒方式進食蠔，亦要確保完全熟透，方可有效降低感染諾如病毒的風險。鑑於近期諾如病毒的活躍程度上升，流行病學數據亦顯示大部分食物中毒是由進食生蠔引致的，而食物環境衞生署食物安全中心正在調查生蠔來源，因此建議市民不應冒險進食未經煮熟的蠔。」

​徐樂堅醫生續說：「值得留意的是，諾如病毒具高度傳染性，因進食受污染食物而感染諾如病毒的人士，可能會透過人與人接觸或受嘔吐物污染的環境，將病毒傳播給其他人。除了食物中毒，諾如病毒亦是引致急性腸胃炎的主要原因之一。我們的監測指標顯示本地急性腸胃炎的活躍程度自一月初起持續上升，最新數據顯示，今年（截至二月十日）暫時已錄得38宗院舍和學校的急性腸胃炎爆發個案，涉及294人。實驗室的檢測顯示超過七成半是諾如病毒引致。此外，其他香港人的旅遊熱點，包括日本及韓國，近日的諾如病毒活躍程度亦持續上升，韓國的監測數據顯示諾如病毒活躍程度達近五年同期的新高。市民外遊時要提高警覺，注意個人、環境及食物衞生，以減低受感染的風險。」

要預防急性腸胃炎及諾如病毒感染，必須經常保持雙手清潔。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手，尤其在處理食物或進食前及如廁後。洗手時應以梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。

二月份第二批涵蓋21個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及一個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，大部份地區均錄得0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

食環署至今已公布二○二六年二月共兩批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共48個監察地區。與上月（即二○二六年一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這48監察地區中，47個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；只有一區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自二○二五年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區62個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。在監察期間，食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
Hong Kong Customs alerts public to one model of unsafe toy truck (with photo),2026-02-11 17:00,2026-02-11 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100558.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (February 11) informed members of the public to stay alert to a model of an unsafe toy truck. Test results indicated that the amount ofClass 2 phthalates contained in the model exceeded the limit stipulated in the Toys and Children's Products Safety Ordinance (TCPSO) and its subsidiary legislation. To avoid an accident, parents should immediately stop their children from playing with the toy. Traders should also remove the toy from their shelves.

Customs officers earlier conducted a test-buy operation on nine models of toy vehicles from retailers in different districts for safety testing. Results from the Government Laboratory revealed that Class 2 phthalates contained in a model of a toy truck reached 2.43 per cent of the total weight of its plasticised materials, exceeding the limit of 0.1 per cent stipulated in the TCPSO and its subsidiary legislation.

Customs later conducted a search operation against three shops of the retailer and seized eight toy trucks of the same model from a branch. Moreover, spot checks were conducted in various districts across the territory. No further toy trucks connected to the case have been found for sale so far. An investigation is ongoing.

Customs reminds members of the public that chronic exposure to plasticiser may harm children's health and cause liver, kidney, reproductive and development system toxicity. When purchasing and using toys, parents should observe the following safety tips:


Do not let children play with toys alone;
Avoid prolonged exposure to,or licking of plastic toys;
Follow the instructions associated with the toys;
Check the structure of the toys to see, for example, whether they have a fragile structure, hidden sharp points, rough surfaces, sharp edges or gaps that may pinch children's fingers; and
Stop children from playing with the toys immediately if any damage is observed.


Customs is committed to the protection of consumer interests and regularly conducts spot checks and safety tests on toys and children's products to ensure that they are reasonably safe for use by consumers.

Under the TCPSO, it is an offence to supply, manufacture or import unsafe toys or children's products. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for one year on first conviction, and a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for two years on subsequent conviction.

Members of the public may report information relating to suspected unsafe toys or children's products via Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Among the second batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 21 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering one survey area in February, most of the areas recorded 0 per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

The FEHD has so far released two batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in February 2026, covering 48 survey areas. Among these 48 survey areas, 47 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. January 2026, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Only one area recorded a slight increase, but the index was lower than 10 per cent.

​The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August 2025, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever (DF). At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 62 survey areas of the community, with a surveillance period of two weeks. During the surveillance period, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#).

"GCMTI specialist awarded title of ""Qi Huang Young Scholar"" - sharing Hong Kong's expertise to serve nation (with photo)",2026-02-11 16:20,2026-02-11 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100553.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) today (February 11) announced that Dr Queenie Wong, a Plant Taxonomist at the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI) of the DH, has been awarded the prestigious title of ""Qi Huang Young Scholar"" by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) following a rigorous selection process. She is the first DH officer to receive this national honour.

The NATCM selects around 100 Chinese medicine practitioners, scholars and researchers across the country every three years. Candidates must be under 45 years old, demonstrate high professional standards, and show capabilities in preserving tradition and driving innovation in Chinese medicine. It nurtures and supports these scholars in conducting pioneering research in Chinese medicine. This year, two scholars from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were honoured with the title: Dr Wong and Professor Lisa Xian, Assistant Professor of the School of Chinese Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, extended his heartfelt congratulations to both recipients.

Dr Wong has served in the DH for nine years. Dr Lam said, ""Dr Wong has devoted herself to the micro-morphological identification of Chinese medicines (CM), combining the strengths of traditional macroscopic techniques with modern microscopic identification methods. Her work has enabled the GCMTI to establish an innovative, practical, and accurate identification system that helps the industry authenticate genuine CM and promotes their safe use. Her selection as a 'Qi Huang Young Scholar' from numerous applicants nationwide not only affirms her outstanding research achievements but also underscores the HKSAR's potential to become an international centre for CM testing and quality control. The GCMTI, which commenced services in phases late last year, is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities that will undoubtedly provide greater support for Dr Wong's research endeavours in the future. Leveraging Hong Kong's strengths, she will contribute to serving the country's needs and, together with the GCMTI's scientific team, advance the development of Chinese medicine for the health and well-being of all.""

Expressing her gratitude, Dr Wong said she is deeply honoured to be nominated by the DH and selected nationally as a ""Qi Huang Young Scholar"". She acknowledges the huge responsibilities that come with the title and looks forward to collaborating with fellow scholars to conduct innovative research under the NATCM's guidance, contributing to the inheritance and advancements of Chinese medicine in the country. She also aspires to further elevate the research capacity in Chinese medicine in Hong Kong and promote co-operation between the HKSAR and the Chinese Mainland.

Since its establishment, the GCMTI has aligned closely with the national strategy for developing Chinese medicine, adopting a three-pronged approach of ""technologies, standards and talents"" to drive high-quality development in Chinese medicine. Dr Wong firmly believes that the GCMTI will continue to inject new momentum into the sector, serving as a vital support for Chinese medicine's global advancement and better integrating into the country's overall development.

The GCMTI brings together experts from multiple disciplines and has long been committed to establishing internationally recognised reference standards and testing methods for CM. By promoting technology transfer, it has enhanced the quality control and identification capabilities of the CM industry and testing sector. The GCMTI has gained widespread recognition in the industry and internationally, particularly for establishing Hong Kong's leading position in the field of micro-morphological identification of CM.

Micro-morphological identification involves using instruments or high-power magnifying glasses to observe minute surface features of CM that are difficult or impossible to discern with the naked eye (see Annex). These features serve as identification criteria, supplementing traditional macroscopic identification methods. For CM with similar morphology, micro-morphology provides additional distinguishing features to differentiate visually similar species. To promote the use of this simple, easy and cost-effective micro-morphological identification, the GCMTI has conducted specific research in this area and developed practical identification methods tailored for real-world applications to address challenges commonly encountered by the industry.

With the phased commissioning of its permanent building since late last year, the GCMTI's advanced technology and equipment will further enhance the development of CM's testing methods and standards, supporting the comprehensive, high-quality development of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong."

透過簽署備忘錄，香港特別行政區（特區）政府和商務部將加強海外綜合服務領域交流合作，發揮香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，促進內地出海企業與香港專業服務機構加強合作，提升服務內地企業出海的能力。備忘錄亦支持香港貿易發展局（貿發局）建立專業服務平台，匯聚金融、法律及爭議解決、會計審計、檢驗認證等香港專業服務機構，為內地出海企業提供服務。

丘應樺感謝商務部一直支持特區政府招商引資的工作，特區政府會發揮好香港在國家對外開放大局中的獨特優勢，支持內地企業出海，進一步促進內地與香港投資和貿易關係，並致力鞏固提升香港作為國際貿易中心的地位。

丘應樺說：「國家正實施高水平雙向對外開放戰略，鼓勵內地企業出海發展。商務部正在牽頭實施海外綜合服務體系建設有關工作。香港作為內聯外通的『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』可以幫助內地企業拓展海外業務，應對在出海過程中可能會遇到的各種挑戰。商經局已成立內地企業出海專班，統籌和協調政策局、部門及相關機構提供一站式出海支援。出海專班會利用多元渠道向目標內地企業宣傳以香港為出海平台的優勢，並按不同企業的需要量身訂製全方位支援服務，以助力內地企業透過香港出海。」

他續指：「貿發局正建立一個跨界別服務平台，匯聚香港不同界別的專業服務提供者，按內地企業的需要進行合適配對，協助它們落戶香港，繼而拓展海外業務。平台亦同時為香港的專業服務提供者帶來更多商機，進一步提升香港專業服務在海內外的影響力。接下來，出海專班會統籌在內地和香港舉辦不同的推廣活動、物色並吸引有意經香港出海的企業。」

行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》提出整合投資推廣署、貿發局和香港駐內地的辦事處的相關職能及組成一站式平台，並成立跨局、跨部門、跨界別的出海專班，主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台出海。自去年十月成立以來，出海專班與內地相關部委保持緊密聯繫，積極敲定並逐步推進有關工作。

CEDB and MOC sign MOU on strengthening co-operation and exchange in provision of comprehensive overseas services (with photos),2026-02-11 16:00,2026-02-11 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100334.htm,"  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, and Member of the Communist Party of China Leadership Group of the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) and Assistant Minister Mr Zhang Li met in Beijing today (February 11) to exchange views on supporting Mainland enterprises to go global. They also witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on strengthening co-operation and exchange in the provision of comprehensive overseas services.

 With the signing of the MOU, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government and the MOC will strengthen co-operation and exchange in the provision of comprehensive overseas services by leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, thereby fostering closer collaboration between Mainland enterprises seeking to go global and Hong Kong professional service providers, and strengthening the capacity of Mainland enterprises in going global. The MOU also supports the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) to develop a professional services platform, pooling together Hong Kong professional service providers in the field of finance, legal and dispute resolution, accounting and audit, testing and certification, etc, to support Mainland enterprises seeking to go global.

 Mr Yau thanked the MOC for its continuous support in the investment promotion work of the HKSAR Government. Leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages amid the opening up of the country, the HKSAR Government will support Mainland enterprises to go global, further foster investment and trade relations between Hong Kong and the Mainland, and strive to reinforce and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international trade centre.

 Mr Yau said, ""The country is implementing a high-level strategy of two-way opening up to encourage Mainland enterprises to go global. The MOC is spearheading the implementation of the related work in the provision of comprehensive overseas services. As a 'super connector' and a 'super value-adder', Hong Kong can help Mainland enterprises expand businesses abroad and overcome challenges encountered in the process. The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau has set up the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force) to co-ordinate cross-bureau, cross-departmental and cross-organisation work to provide one-stop go global support. The GoGlobal Task Force will make use of various channels to promote to target Mainland enterprises the advantages of using Hong Kong as a springboard to go global. It will also provide tailored services according to the needs of the enterprises to support their overseas expansion through Hong Kong.""

 Mr Yau added, ""The HKTDC is currently developing a cross-sectoral platform, which assembles Hong Kong professional service providers from different fields to match them with different Mainland enterprises based on their needs, thereby supporting the enterprises to establish a foothold in Hong Kong and then expand their businesses overseas. The platform will also bring more business opportunities to the Hong Kong professional service providers and increase the influence of Hong Kong professional services locally and internationally. The GoGlobal Task Force will co-ordinate the organisation of different promotional events on the Mainland and Hong Kong, and will identify and attract enterprises to go global via Hong Kong.""

 In his 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced the establishment of a one-stop platform by mobilising Hong Kong's overseas offices, including those under Invest Hong Kong and the HKTDC, as well as Hong Kong offices on the Mainland, and has set up the cross-bureau, cross-departmental and cross-sectoral GoGlobal Task Force to proactively attract Mainland enterprises to go global via Hong Kong.

政府中藥檢測中心專家獲國家授予「青年岐黃學者」稱號　以香港專長貢獻國家（附圖）,2026-02-11 15:00,2026-02-11 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100483.htm,"衞生署今日（二月十一日）公布，衞生署轄下政府中藥檢測中心（檢測中心）植物分類學家黃麗麗博士，經國家中醫藥管理局（管理局）嚴格選拔，獲國家授予「青年岐黃學者」稱號，成為首位獲此殊榮的衞生署人員。

管理局每三年在全國遴選約100位45歲以下、具高中醫藥專業水平和傳承創新能力的中醫師、學者和研究人員，重點培養和支持他們進行有關中醫藥的前沿創新研究。今年香港特別行政區（特區）共有兩人獲國家授予「青年岐黃學者」稱號，另一名獲此殊榮的是香港中文大學中醫學院助理教授冼彥芳。衞生署署長林文健醫生衷心恭賀黃麗麗博士及冼彥芳教授。

黃麗麗博士加入衞生署已九年，林文健醫生說：「黃麗麗博士長期致力於微性狀鑒定中藥，結合傳統性狀鑒定與現代顯微技術的優點，協助檢測中心制定一套創新、簡便而準確的鑒定方法，讓業界更容易鑒定中藥正品，同時有助推動中藥安全使用。她從全國眾多申請人中脫穎而出成為新一屆『青年岐黃學者』一員，除了充分肯定她的卓越研究成就，亦彰顯香港特區具備成為中藥檢測和質量控制國際中心的能力。去年底分階段投入服務的檢測中心配備尖端設施，日後定能為她的研究工作提供更大助力，以香港所長貢獻國家所需。黃博士將與檢測中心的科學團隊共同為推動國家中醫藥發展、為人類健康福祉貢獻智慧和源源力量。」

黃麗麗博士對獲衞生署推薦參與全國選拔，並獲選「青年岐黃學者」深感榮幸，亦深知任重道遠。她希望可以與其他頂尖的「青年岐黃學者」在管理局的指導下，開展更多創新研究，助力國家中醫藥的傳承和突破，同時進一步提升本港中醫藥的科研水平，促進香港特區和中國內地的合作。

檢測中心成立以來，一直緊隨國家中醫藥發展戰略，奉行「技術、標準、人才」三輪驅動，助力中醫藥高品質發展。黃麗麗博士深信她服務的檢測中心定能為中醫藥高品質發展不斷注入新動力，成為中醫藥走向世界的重要支撐點，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

檢測中心匯聚多個學科的精英，多年來致力為中藥建立國際認可的參考標準與檢測方法，並透過推動技術轉移，提升中藥業界與檢測業界在品質控制與鑒定的能力，深受業界及國際認可，特別在中藥微性狀鑒定領域，為香港建立了領先地位。

微性狀鑒定是應用儀器或高倍放大鏡（見附件），觀察中藥表面肉眼不易察覺或未能看清的細微性狀特徵，並以此作為鑒定依據，是傳統性狀鑒定的延伸。對於性狀特徵較為相近的中藥，微性狀可以提供更多特徵以助區別外形相似的品種。由於微性狀鑒定簡便易行而又經濟實用，因此檢測中心特別開展有關方面的研究，針對業界日常所遇到的困難，建立切合實際應用的鑒定方法。

隨着檢測中心永久大樓自去年底分階段投入服務，其高端科技和器材將進一步提升中藥檢測方法及中藥標準開發能力，助力香港中醫藥全方位高質量發展。"

Secretary for Health visits Shenzhen (with photos),2026-02-11 14:58,2026-02-11 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100422.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, visited Shenzhen today (February 11) to meet with health officials from the Guangdong Provincial and Shenzhen Municipal Governments, as well as port control officials. The visit aims to further deepen cross-boundary healthcare collaboration with the Mainland, particularly with Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

  Professor Lo first met with Deputy Director of the Public Hygiene and Health Commission of Shenzhen Municipality (SZHC) Mr Li Chuang and Second-level Inspector of the Office of Port of Entry and Exit of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government (Shenzhen Port Office) Mr Wu Bing as well as representatives from the Shenzhen Customs and the Shenzhen General Station of Immigration Inspection. A representative from the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office of the Department of Health (DH) introduced the tobacco control direction and policies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government at the meeting.

  Professor Lo expressed gratitude to the Shenzhen Municipal Government for their long-time support in fostering cross-boundary healthcare measures. He said, ""I would like to give special thanks to the SZHC, the Shenzhen Port Office, the Shenzhen Customs and the Shenzhen General Station of Immigration Inspection for their support on the HKSAR Government's work on tobacco control, including enhancing the promotion of Hong Kong's latest tobacco control regulations to visitors travelling to Hong Kong in the boundary control point area in Shenzhen, and working together in advocating the concept of the 'Smoke-free Port, Fresh Bay Area'. I look forward to deepening co-operation and exchanges between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, thereby reducing the harm caused by tobacco together and safeguarding public health.""

  Professor Lo then visited the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital (HKU-SZH) with Deputy Director-General of the Health Commission of Guangdong Province (GDHC) Mr Deng Linfeng to inspect the practical implementation of cross-boundary healthcare measures and visit the hospital's phase II development.

  Professor Lo said, ""Since July 2024, the Health Bureau has piloted the 'Cross-boundary Health Record' and the 'Personal Folder' functions on the eHealth mobile application at HKU-SZH, which support Hong Kong citizens to securely use their electronic health records outside Hong Kong under the principle of 'bring your own health records'. The two functions have been extended to 19 medical institutions under the 'Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme' since September 2024. Starting January this year, we have made a significant breakthrough through the 'Personal Folder' function. Citizens can authorise three medical institutions in the GBA to directly deposit radiology reports and images, which are often challenging to upload themselves, into their personal eHealth accounts. This upgrade allows citizens to store and utilise electronic health records from healthcare services received outside Hong Kong in a more convenient and secure manner, thereby facilitating greater continuity of care. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the GDHC to further advance cross-boundary health record sharing, with a view to supporting the cross-boundary medical needs of citizens more effectively and improving the quality and safety of cross-boundary healthcare services.""

  During the inspection at HKU-SZH, Professor Lo also interacted with Hong Kong seniors receiving treatment. He was pleased to learn that they found the usage arrangements for the Elderly Health Care Voucher convenient, with the medical process and services being meticulous and smooth. They commended the HKSAR Government for expanding the voucher's applicability to 21 service points within the Mainland cities of the GBA, providing them with more healthcare options and saving them the trouble of long journeys, thereby enhancing their sense of well-being.

  Members of the delegation include the Permanent Secretary for Health, Mr Thomas Chan, and representatives from the DH and the Hospital Authority."

牌照處發言人表示：「牌照處根據情報，在整個行動突擊巡查了十二個處所，當中有六個處所均涉嫌無牌經營酒店或賓館，另外有三個持牌賓館則被發現涉嫌違反發牌條件。如在完成調查後有足夠證據，牌照處會作出檢控。」

發言人強調：「無牌經營酒店或賓館屬刑事罪行，根據《旅館業條例》，一經定罪會留有案底，最高刑罰為監禁三年及罰款500,000元，就罪行持續期間的每一日亦可被另處罰款20,000元。針對涉及重犯罪行的無牌經營酒店／賓館，法庭亦可就有關處所發出為期六個月的封閉令。另外，凡持牌酒店／賓館違反任何發牌條件（例如：未經批准進行改動及加建工程），一經定罪最高可處罰款100,000元及監禁兩年，並可就罪行持續期間的每一日另處罰款10,000元。」

為加強阻嚇力以打擊無牌酒店及賓館，《旅館業條例》於二○二○年作出修訂，賦權旅館業監督就同一處所於16個月內第二次因無牌經營酒店或賓館或嚴格法律責任罪行而有人被定罪，向法院申請向該處所發出封閉令，為期六個月。截至一月三十一日，牌照處根據《旅館業條例》向法院申請發出五宗封閉令，而其中三宗封閉令已獲法院批准。

Office of Licensing Authority of Home Affairs Department steps up enforcement actions against unlicensed and licensed hotels/guesthouses before Chinese New Year holidays (with photo),2026-02-11 14:45,2026-02-11 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100416.htm,"Before the Chinese New Year holidays, the Office of the Licensing Authority (OLA) of the Home Affairs Department conducted an operation codenamed ""Solar Flare"" against suspected unlicensed hotels or guesthouses at Yau Tsim Mong District in early February to ensure the safety of the customers as well as the general public. The OLA also conducted the operation with the Immigration Department and the Labour Department to jointly inspect licensed hotels or guesthouses.

A spokesman for the OLA said, ""Based on intelligence gathered, the OLA carried out surprise inspections on 12 premises throughout the whole operation. Six premises were suspected of operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses, while three licensed guesthouses were suspected of breaching certain licensing conditions. The OLA will initiate prosecution on cases with sufficient evidence after completion of the investigation.""

The spokesman stressed, ""Operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses is a criminal offence leading to a criminal record upon conviction. According to the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance, an offender is liable to three years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of $500,000. A fine of $20,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues. Moreover, a licensed hotel or guesthouse which contravenes any licensing conditions (e.g. carrying out alteration and addition works without seeking prior approval) is liable to two years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. A fine of $10,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues.""

To enhance deterrence against unlicensed hotels and guesthouses, the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance was amended in 2020 to empower the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Authority to apply to the court, upon the second conviction within 16 months of operating an unlicensed hotel or guesthouse or the new strict liability offence in respect of the same premises, to issue a closure order to close the premises for six months. As at January 31, the OLA has applied for five closure orders under the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance from the court, of which three closure orders have been issued by the court. 

Apart from conducting special operations during festive seasons, the OLA also steps up efforts to combat unlicensed guesthouses via online platforms. The OLA has strengthened its intelligence collection by forming a dedicated team to browse webpages, mobile applications, social media, discussion forums, etc, to search for information and intelligence on suspected unlicensed guesthouses. The OLA's law enforcement officers will initiate follow-up investigations when information on unlicensed guesthousesadvertised via online platforms is found. The OLA also conducts publicity work on Internet search engines outside Hong Kong toenable tourists' access to the information provided by the OLA in the course of planning their trips to Hong Kong.

Tourists and members of the public can make use of the search functions on the OLA's website (www.hadla.gov.hk) to check whether the hotel or guesthouse concerned is licensed or not. Any suspected unlicensed hotel or guesthouse should be reported to the OLA by the hotline (Tel: 2881 7498), by email (hadlaenq@had.gov.hk), by fax (2504 5805), or through the mobile application ""Hong Kong Licensed Hotels and Guesthouses""."

  Over 300 guests from various sectors including political and business circles, media, academic and community groups as well as government representatives attended the reception. Among them were the Consul-General of the People's Republic of China in Sydney, Mr Wang Yu; the Minister for Better Regulation and Fair Trading, the Minister for Industry and Trade, the Minister for Innovation, Science and Technology, the Minister for Building and Minister for Corrections of New South Wales (NSW), Mr Anoulack Chanthivong, representing the Premier of NSW; and Councillor of the City of Sydney Mr Robert Kok, representing the Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney.
  
  The Director of the Sydney ETO, Mr Ricky Chong, said in his welcoming remarks that Hong Kong and Australia have long shared a dynamic and multifaceted partnership, underpinned by close co-operation in trade, investment, education, cultural exchanges and people-to-people ties. He noted that Hong Kong was Australia's 15th-largest trading partner and ninth-largest export market last year, with bilateral trade in goods reaching AU$8 billion, while around 200 Australian companies operate in Hong Kong, many using the city as regional headquarters or regional offices.

  Mr Chong highlighted the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's ongoing efforts to strengthen international economic engagement through the establishment of the Economic and Trade Express, which brings together the collective strengths of overseas Economic and Trade Offices, Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The initiative supports Hong Kong enterprises in exploring overseas opportunities and assists Mainland companies in going global, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

  He also introduced the Northern Metropolis, Hong Kong's most ambitious city-building project, which will become a new engine for innovation, technology, education and advanced industries, creating fresh opportunities for businesses, talent and investors from around the world, including Australia.

  Mr Chong also highlighted the launch of the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand, positioning Hong Kong as an international post-secondary education hub. With five universities ranked among the world's top 100 and a strong emphasis on research and innovation, Hong Kong offers a truly international learning environment for global talent.

  ""As we welcome the Year of the Horse, we look forward to deepening our partnership with NSW and the rest of Australia, expanding collaboration, strengthening economic ties, and fostering even closer connections between our peoples,"" Mr Chong said.

醫務衞生局局長到深圳調研（附圖）,2026-02-11 13:55,2026-02-11 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100391.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（二月十一日）到訪深圳，與廣東省和深圳市政府的衞生和口岸辦官員會面，持續深化與內地，特別是大灣區內地城市在醫療衞生方面的跨境協作。

盧寵茂教授首先與深圳市衞生健康委員會（衞健委）副主任李創、深圳市人民政府口岸辦公室（深圳口岸辦）二級巡視員吳兵，以及深圳海關和深圳出入境邊防檢查總站（深圳邊檢總站）代表進行會談，衞生署控煙酒辦公室代表亦在會上簡介香港特別行政區（特區）政府的控煙方向及政策。

盧寵茂教授感謝深圳市政府就促進各項跨境醫療措施一直以來的支持。他說﹕「我特別感謝深圳市衞健委、深圳口岸辦、深圳海關和深圳邊檢總站對特區政府控煙工作的支持，包括加強在深圳的口岸範圍向來港旅客宣傳香港的最新控煙規定，攜手推廣『無煙口岸，清新灣區』的概念。我期望深港兩地繼續深化合作與交流，共同降低煙害，守護公眾健康。」

盧寵茂教授其後與廣東省衞健委副主任鄧林峰到香港大學深圳醫院（港大深圳醫院）調研跨境醫療措施的實際使用情況，並參觀港大深圳醫院二期建設。

盧寵茂教授表示︰「醫衞局自二○二四年七月起以港大深圳醫院作試點推行醫健通流動應用程式的『跨境健康紀錄』及『個人資料夾』功能，在自攜病歷的原則下，便利香港市民安全地跨境使用電子健康紀錄。兩項功能自二○二四年九月起擴展至『長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃』下的19間醫療機構。由今年一月起，我們實現進一步突破，讓市民可透過『個人資料夾』功能授權三間大灣區醫院直接存入一些較難自行上傳的放射檢查報告及影像至個人醫健通戶口，從而更便捷和安全地保存和運用境外就醫時的電子健康紀錄，以獲得更連貫的護理服務。我們期望與廣東省衞健委繼續合力推展跨境醫療紀錄互通，務求更有效地支援市民的跨境醫療需求，提升跨境醫護服務的質量安全。」

在港大深圳醫院視察期間，盧寵茂教授亦與到診的香港長者交流，欣悉他們認為長者醫療券（醫療券）的使用安排便利，就醫流程和服務細緻及暢順，並讚揚特區政府擴展醫療券的適用範圍至大灣區內地城市21個服務點，讓他們有更多就醫選擇並可省卻舟車勞動，為他們帶來幸福感。

代表團成員包括醫衞局常任秘書長陳松青、衞生署代表和醫院管理局代表。"
Speech by FS at Consensus Hong Kong 2026 (English only) (with photos/video),2026-02-11 13:44,2026-02-11 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100394.htm," Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Consensus Hong Kong 2026 today (February 11):

Michael (Chairman of Consensus, Mr Michael Lau), Tom (Chief Executive Officer of Bullish Group, Mr Tom Farley), Jay (President of CoinDesk, Mr Jay Yarow), industry leaders and innovators, friends from around the world,

  It is a pleasure to join you all at the Consensus Conference in Hong Kong for the second consecutive year. Let me begin by thanking CoinDesk for once again choosing Hong Kong to host this iconic event. This conference has become a powerful platform in Asia for exploring the cutting-edge trends in the Web3 space and for fostering partnerships and collaboration. 

Evolving global trends

 Globally, the application of Web3 technologies in finance continues to broaden in both scope and sophistication. A few trends are more prominent. The first is tokenisation of RWAs (real-world assets). In a growing number of markets, tokenisation initiatives are moving from ""proof of concept"" to real-word deployment, supported by more institutional adoption. Government bonds, money market funds and other more traditional financial instruments are increasingly being issued or mirrored on-chain, using digital ledgers to enhance settlement efficiency, enable fractional ownership and unlock liquidity in assets that have traditionally been less liquid.

 Hong Kong is one of the pioneers in this space. The HKSAR Government was the first in the world to issue tokenised government green bonds. Last year, we build on this foundation by issuing the world's largest digital green bond, with a multi-currency offering of HK$10 billion. Meanwhile, financial institutions are becoming more receptive to digital assets. By the end of last year, banks in Hong Kong held over HK$14 billion in digital assets under custody, a year-on-year increase of about 180 per cent. Banks have also begun offering tokenised deposit services, with the total value of such deposits reaching HK$29 billion by the end of last year.

 The second trend is a related and evolving one: that is, the interaction between ""TradFi"" (traditional finance) and ""DeFi"" (decentralised finance). Traditional institutions are now importing DeFi mechanisms into their own architectures – such as automated market-making, programmable liquidity pools and the use of on-chain collateral – to support more efficient trading, funding and settlement.At the same time, DeFi is coming under growing regulatory and supervisory pressure in multiple jurisdictions, particularly in relation to anti-money laundering, investor protection, and broader financial stability. There have been growing calls for DeFi to be brought under existing or emerging digital-asset regulatory frameworks.

 The third trend is the growing intersection between AI and digital assets. AI systems are being designed to interact with tokenised money and smart contracts, enabling the autonomous execution of certain transactions and settlements. At the same time, AI tools are making digital asset markets more intelligent, efficient and data-driven. As AI agents become capable of making and executing decisions independently, we may begin to see the early forms of what some call the ""machine economy"": where AI agents can hold and transfer digital assets, pay for services, and transact with one another on chain. While this shift could deliver substantial efficiency gains, it also raises important questions around AI governance, accountability, and cybersecurity. 

Hong Kong's approach

 Against this backdrop of rapid global experimentation, what are we doing in Hong Kong? We are charting our course, leveraging our unique strengths as an international financial centre to stay at the forefront of innovation and keep pace with emerging developments. A few principles are guiding our strategy. 

 First, under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong is free to explore financial innovation, including in digital assets. We stand out as a market with consistent, predictable, forward-looking policies, and a balanced and trusted regulatory framework.We welcome Web3 innovators and institutions from around the world to develop and scale their businesses here. 

 At the same time, we recognisethat innovation often moves faster than regulation, potentially creating gaps and new risks. We are therefore carefully balancing the promotion of innovation with the need for sound risk management. Our objective is to embrace new technologies while safeguarding investors, consumers and the overall financial stability. The principle of ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"" continues to underpin the design of our regulatory framework.

 Second, we see Web3, blockchain technology and AI as powerful enablers of the real economy, rather than ends in themselves.Our policy focus is therefore on how these technologies can be applied to enhance efficiency, lower costs and support concrete, real-world use cases. Ultimately, our aim is to make financial services more inclusive and accessible, while addressing long-standing pain points in transactions and market operations. 

 Third, we are committed to pro-innovation regulation. Our regulators operate with a dual mandate: they not only exercise prudent supervision, but also actively facilitate market and product development.Through mechanisms such as regulatory sandboxes, we support experimentation and, in some cases, co-create solutions in close collaboration with innovators and industry participants.

Some latest initiatives

 Ladies and gentlemen, with these guiding principles in mind, we are pressing ahead to advance Web3 development in Hong Kong. Let me highlight some of our latest initiatives. 

 First, on regulation. We continue to enhance Hong Kong's regulatory framework for digital assets, including the launch of a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers in August last year. We see stablecoins as a practical tool for addressing the pain points in the real economy, particularly in payments and settlements. In giving out licences, we ensure that licensees have real-world use cases, a credible and sustainable business model, as well as strong regulatory compliance capabilities. Our strategy is moving forward fast, step by step. Therefore, we plan to issue only a small number of stablecoin issuer licences in the first batch in March this year. 

 Meanwhile, we are also finalising the details of a new licensing regime for digital asset dealers and custodian service providers, with the aim of introducing the relevant legislation this summer. Together with the frameworks already in place, this will ensure that our overall regulatory regime comprehensively covers the key nodes of the digital asset ecosystem.

 Second, on product innovation and development. We will regularise the issuance of tokenised green bonds. At the same time, we encourage market innovation and nurture the broader ecosystem. For example, building on the Project Ensemble sandbox, Ensemble TX was launched by the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) in November last year. It is a new pilot phase that enables faster, more transparent and more efficient settlement of real-value tokenised transactions.

 Looking ahead, as the convergence of AI and blockchain continues to accelerate, the Government and our regulators will work with the industry to foster concrete, high-impact use cases, while ensuring that emerging risks are properly identified, monitored and managed.

Concluding Remarks

 Ladies and gentlemen, before I close, let me leave you with this message: the Hong Kong SAR Government and our financial regulators fully recognise the need of and are committed to keeping pace with rapid technological change, and building a vibrant digital asset ecosystem here in Hong Kong. We welcome global innovators like you to join us on this journey.

 In less than a week, we will celebrate the Chinese New Year. The Year of the Horse symbolises agility, stamina and strength. May I wish you all a prosperous and energetic year ahead. And for those who have travelled from afar, I hope you will take some time to enjoy the festive spirit and unique charm of Hong Kong.

 My thanks once again to CoinDesk for hosting this remarkable event in Hong Kong. May this event inspire many more fresh ideas and lasting partnerships. Thank you very much."

巡查仍在進行中。

海關提醒消費者應光顧信譽良好的商戶，而當購買以重量供應的貨品時，應留意商戶秤量時的過程和貨品的實際重量。

海關同時提醒商戶亦應遵守《條例》的規定。根據《條例》，任何人在按重量或度量供應貨物時，必須按淨重量或淨度量供應；假若貨物的實際重量或度量少於所宣稱的供應量，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一萬元。此外，任何人使用或管有任何偽誤或不完備的度量衡器具以作商業用途，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二萬五千元。而任何人未有讓顧客清楚看見稱量工具所顯示的重量，最高可被判罰款五千元。

Hong Kong Customs combats traders supplying shortweight Chinese New Year products,2026-02-11 12:45,2026-02-11 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100250.htm,"Starting from January 29, Hong Kong Customs conducted a territory-wide inspection to combat traders supplying shortweight products before the Chinese New Year. After test buys and spot checks, five traders suspected of violating the regulations were found, in contravention of the Weights and Measures Ordinance (WMO).

During the operation, Customs officers found that five traders supplied shortweight Chinese New Year products, including red melon seeds, pistachios and candied lotus seeds, with discrepancies ranging from 6 per cent to 19 per cent.

The inspections are ongoing.

Customs reminds consumers to purchase products from reputable shops and pay attention to the weighing process and the actual weight when the products are supplied by weight.

Customs also reminds traders to comply with the requirements of the WMO. Under the WMO, any person who in the course of trade supplies goods to another person by weight or measure should supply the goods in net weight or net measure. Any shortage of the quantity purporting to be supplied is an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $10,000. In addition, any person who uses for trade, or has in his possession for use for trade, any weighing or measuring equipment which is false or defective commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $25,000. Also, any person who fails to let customers have a clear view of readings of the weighing or measuring equipment is liable to a maximum penalty of a fine of $5,000.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement action against shortweight activities to protect consumers' interests and uphold a fair trading environment.
​
Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the WMO to the Customs 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

記者：二○一八年大埔車禍獨立檢討委員會的專家指他沒有要求巴士乘客強制佩戴安全帶，但局長早前表示這是委員會的建議，你有甚麼回應？是不是誤解了他們的說法？

運輸及物流局局長：我們早前已作交代，會就安全帶法例重新檢視和諮詢公眾。

記者：今早港鐵服務受阻，屬於嚴重事故，懷疑有訊號設備被撞跌在路軌。港鐵是否需要檢討？事發至今港鐵仍未交代事件經過，亦沒有確實指出是關於甚麼物件，只有傳媒消息流通，是否需要港鐵盡快交代？

運輸及物流局局長：政府非常關注港鐵港島綫今早出現事故，影響正常服務，其間我們立即要求港鐵動員派出免費接駁巴士，有超過30輛巴士為市民提供服務。其間運輸署亦要求巴士營辦商加強專營巴士服務，照顧市民需要。

我們已要求港鐵公司就今早的事故於一個月內提交調查報告。另外，我亦要求機電工程署人員到場，現正與港鐵公司就今早發生的事故作詳細了解。同時，我亦已要求港鐵公司在今日內盡快向各位傳媒和市民交代他們初步的調查情況，政府會密切跟進。"
TD to implement special arrangements for licence renewals before and after Budget Day,2026-02-11 11:00,2026-02-11 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021000604.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) said today (February 11) that to prevent members of the public from rushing to the Licensing Offices to submit renewal applications for expiring or expired vehicle and driving licences before Budget Day, the TD will implement the following arrangements:


All vehicle licences eligible for renewal on or before Budget Day (February 25), i.e. vehicles that are registered at the time of renewal and have licence expiry dates falling on or before June 24, may be renewed at the present rate (note) for four months or 12 months at any time up to and including June 24;
	
All Hong Kong full driving licences and driving instructor's licences eligible for renewal on or before Budget Day (February 25), i.e. those expiring on or before June 24 and those that have expired for less than three years at the time of renewal, may be renewed at the present rate at any time up to and including June 24; and
	
The above special arrangements only apply to renewal applications for vehicle licences, Hong Kong full driving licences and driving instructor's licences that meet the conditions above, but not other licensing services.


""Eligible licence holders do not need to rush to the Licensing Offices to submit renewal applications for their vehicle or driving licences on speculation that their fees may increase in the Budget. The special arrangements are not related to the content of the Budget, about which the TD has no information,"" a spokesman for the TD said.

Note: For electric private cars, the present rate refers to the licence fee structure and levels effective from November 1, 2025. Since the Government provides a four-month grace period fee arrangement for eligible vehicle owners, if their vehicle licences expire on or before February 28, 2026, they may be renewed on or before the licence expiry date at the old fee level in effect before November 1, 2025."

所有在《財政預算案》發表日（二月二十五日）或之前合資格續領的車輛牌照（即六月二十四日或之前牌照期滿而仍有登記的車輛），可在六月二十四日或之前的任何時間按現行收費（註）續期四個月或12個月；
	
所有在《財政預算案》發表日（二月二十五日）或之前合資格續領的香港正式駕駛執照及駕駛教師執照（即六月二十四日或之前期滿，而在續領時期滿不足三年的執照），可在六月二十四日或之前的任何時間按現行收費續領執照；及
	
上述特別安排只適用於符合上述條件的車輛牌照、香港正式駕駛執照和駕駛教師執照的續期申請，不適用於其他牌照服務。


運輸署發言人表示︰「合資格牌照／執照持有人無須揣測《財政預算案》可能提高牌照／執照費用，而急於向各牌照事務處遞交車輛牌照或駕駛執照續領申請。特別安排與《財政預算案》的內容沒有任何關係，署方亦不知悉《財政預算案》的內容。」

註：以電動私家車而言，續領車輛牌照的現行收費是指自二○二五年十一月一日起生效的牌費架構和水平。由於政府為合資格車主提供四個月寬限期的牌費安排，如車輛牌照於二○二六年二月二十八日或之前屆滿，車主仍可在牌照到期日或之前按照二○二五年十一月一日前的舊牌費水平續領牌照。"
​運輸及物流局局長在立法會交通事務委員會就《運輸策略藍圖》開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-11 10:55,2026-02-11 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100210.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（二月十一日）在立法會交通事務委員會就《運輸策略藍圖》的開場發言：

主席、各位議員：

今日向大家匯報關於《運輸策略藍圖》的措施和未來的規劃布局。因為材料非常豐富，我會先簡短發言，希望主席容許我稍後請運輸署助理署長用幾張投影片向大家重點介紹。

交通運輸是現代都市的重要基石，關係着經濟發展，大灣區融合，更是市民每日日常出行的需要。我們團隊按最新的土地規劃，考慮最新的科技發展，制訂了《運輸策略藍圖》，定出未來的工作目標、策略和方向，制定短、中、長期的措施，短期為二○二六及二七年、中期為二○二八至三二年、長期為二○三三至四○年及以後，務求為香港的經濟發展謀動力，令市民的生活更便捷。

《藍圖》以「政策創新」與「技術創新」的「雙創新」思維，前瞻未來二十多年的發展願景。我們將繼續以鐵路為骨幹，並會提升公共交通服務及促進運輸發展進一步邁向智能化、靈活化；亦會促進跨境交通，加強人流與物流的互聯互通。

《藍圖》所訂的「三大主題」與「六大策略」架構共提出25項具體措施，稍後同事會作詳細介紹。最重要的，是在勾劃宏觀、前瞻的布局的同時，亦要令市民感受到，我們可以回應市民需要、增加便利，以及日常出行時所關注的事項。《藍圖》提出將於二○二六年推進27個項目，我想特別提出並重點講講今年內我們的10項重點措施：

（一）首先是基建，我們會強化本地和跨境運輸基建，在「八縱八橫」的運輸基建布局下，首要在今年內全線開通六號幹線、全力推展一系列鐵路及主要道路項目。我們亦會開展研究港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海）南向延伸方案，加上在策略地點如洪水橋、新田、紅磡等規劃多元化、最新的運輸交匯樞紐，連通港九新界、市區及北部都會區各個經濟和居住區域，帶動經濟發展和促進人員往來及加快貨物暢通流動；

（二）第二亦與「八縱八橫」相關。隨着經濟及社會發展，我們預期過海交通的壓力會持續增加。因此，我們會研究在未有交椅洲人工島發展下擴大過海交通容量不同方案的可行性，包括現有倡議的走線，即港島西至大嶼山東北連接路、擴建現有隧道，或其他走線方案等。政府會以開放態度仔細研究，以人為本，凝聚共識，務求長遠的基建方案能達致理想的運輸、經濟及成本效益；

（三）在啟德、東九龍及洪水橋／厦村新發展區推展「智慧綠色集體運輸系統」。啟德的項目將於今年內批出合約，而東九龍及洪水橋／厦村新發展區的項目（第一階段）亦會於今年內招標；

（四）公共交通方面，本港公交系統「世一」，每日接近九成出行人次使用公交出行。我們會善用科技，為乘客提供更具效率的公交服務。我們會於今年內推出「需求導向智慧公交」的試行路線，目的是在現行服務之上，透過靈活調派車輛，照顧乘客需求。我們會與專營巴士公司一同探討不同應用場景，例如在偏遠地區或是客流較分散的時段提供加強服務；

（五）在個人化點對點服務方面，預計首批持牌網約車平台最快可於今年第四季開始營運，讓的士與網約車並存互補，為市民提供多元、便捷的個人化點對點服務；

（六）對駕駛者來說，我們會致力透過「一地多用」提供泊車位、自動泊車系統等一系列措施增加車位供應。我們正推進在今年內達成我們於去年初定下兩年間新增逾12 000個私家車及商用車位的目標。我們亦將展開新一輪泊車位供求研究，全面檢視尤其是商用車的停泊情況及需求，長遠做到「商用車輛，夜有所泊」；

（七）科技應用方面，我們將緊貼大數據和人工智能發展，推動數字化交通管理，令市民出行更有效率。我們會籌備市區內首個「交通管理平台」試點應用項目，向公眾提供更多、更實時的交通資訊以規劃行程；

（八）成立由運輸署署長主持的自動駕駛車輛應用促進工作組，目標是訂立自動駕駛載客營運路線圖。在工作組之下，我們希望做到跨部門聯同行業持份者審視自動車項目的進度與需求，並就自動車的測試地點、車輛類別，以及為配合自動車邁向商業營運所需要的牌證安排提供督導。最重要的是，我們會在今年內努力爭取陸續推出「航天走廊」載客服務、積極推進在東涌、機場及啟德等項目邁向無人化；

（九）積極布局低空經濟，制訂《發展低空經濟規劃行動綱領》，構建具國際競爭力的低空經濟生態圈，促進現代運輸發展。首批多於20個「監管沙盒」中較為成熟、風險相對較低的項目，例如無人機進行外牆清洗、電纜、鐵路設施檢視等會進入實際運作；及

（十）我們務求做到人車兼顧，因此更會便利行人，令出行體驗更佳、更省時。我們擴展「實時燈號調節」，以人工智能分析路口的即時車流和行人流量，計算最合適的燈號時間，加強路口運作效率；亦會在全港更多地點設立對角行人過路處，減少行人通過十字路口的時間。

以上是今年的重點工作。《藍圖》以宏觀視野為香港未來二十多年的發展提供動力之外，我亦希望每位市民能夠感受到《藍圖》中每一項措施，都是以一個字，就是「人」作為核心思想，期望令大家在不久的將來，可在日常的生活細節中，感受到更完善的交通網絡、更貼心的公交服務和更易行的城市環境所帶來的好處。

整體而言，特區政府會主動積極對接國家「十五五」規劃，《藍圖》的制定正正響應國家策略，對接「十五五」規劃建議，透過宏觀的基建布局，結合科技創新，吸引國家科企來港，共同構建香港未來的運輸體系，以支撐本港的金融、航運、貿易中心的高效運作，連接全球，促進區域協同發展，以及發揮本港「內聯外通」優勢的戰略使命。這兩方面都是同樣重要，亦是相輔相成。

主席，我現在請運輸署助理署長梁世豪透過投影片介紹重點策略。"

"Speech by SFST at Inaugural Family Office Forum ""Stewardship in the Chinese Context: Family, Legacy, Future"" (English Only)",2026-02-11 10:33,2026-02-11 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021000660.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Inaugural Family Office Forum ""Stewardship in the Chinese Context: Family, Legacy, Future"" today (February 11):

Zhou Li (Deputy Editor-in-Chief of China Daily), ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,

 Good morning. It is a great privilege to address you today at this Inaugural Family Office Forum. As we work together to position Hong Kong as Asia's premier strategic hub for family offices, we recognise the profound interplay in the Chinese context between family wealth, legacy building, and future planning. Here, wealth stewardship extends beyond financial growth to embrace social responsibility, intergenerational harmony, and lasting impact. Hong Kong is committed to fostering an ecosystem that supports sustainable, responsible, and enduring wealth preservation for families worldwide.

 Hong Kong has long been a leading global wealth management centre. As of the end of 2024, total assets under management in our asset and wealth management sector surpassed HK$35 trillion, with more than 54 per cent originating from outside Hong Kong and the Mainland. The private banking and private wealth management business linked to family offices and private trusts reached HK$1,551 billion. Hong Kong ranks as Asia's largest cross-border wealth management centre, and holds the second position in private equity capital under management in Asia after the Mainland. These strengths create a natural, robust platform for family offices to manage, protect, and grow their wealth effectively.

 With a long history of expertise in private wealth management, underpinned by the rule of law, world-class professional services, and unparalleled connectivity, Hong Kong is ideally positioned as a trusted base for global high-net-worth families establishing or expanding family offices. Globally, over 2.3 million individuals have a net worth exceeding US$10 million, with more than 36 per cent in Asia. Recent data shows Hong Kong hosts the highest number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals in Asia - over 17 000 - making us a magnet for talent and capital in this space.

 In March 2023, we issued the Policy Statement on Developing Family Office Businesses in Hong Kong, outlining targeted measures to build a competitive and supportive ecosystem. These include, among others, a tax concessions regime, the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (New CIES), and the establishment of the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy. As of end-January this year, the New CIES has received over 3 000 applications, with potential investments exceeding HK$90 billion if all approved. More than 1 600 applications have been formally approved, with investments in equities, debt securities, certificates of deposit, eligible collective investment schemes, limited partnership funds, and real estate with certain restrictions in place.

 Invest Hong Kong's dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team provides one-stop support for family offices seeking to establish or expand in our market. By the end of last year, the team had assisted more than 200 family offices to set up or grow their presence in Hong Kong.

 Building on this momentum, market research just revealed yesterday that Hong Kong now hosts over 3 300 single family offices, an increase of over 25 per cent over a two-year period. We achieved our 2022-25 target of facilitating at least 200 family offices to set up or expand in Hong Kong ahead of schedule. Looking forward, as we plan to further develop the sector, we aim to attract at least 220 more family offices to establish or expand operations here from 2026 to 2028, broadening our reach to include more markets, for example Europe, the Middle East and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). Beyond investments, family offices contribute substantially through other economic and social channels. It is estimated that single family offices in Hong Kong collectively contribute about HK$12.6 billion annually to the local economy through operating expenditure alone, and that they directly employ over 10 000 full-time professionals within their operations.

 Over the past two years, proactive promotion and supportive policies have made family offices a vital pillar of Hong Kong's financial ecosystem. The city offers a unique blend of top-tier professional services, an exceptional quality of life, and leadership in emerging areas such as green and sustainable investments, art, culture, and philanthropy. We will continue refining our measures - including further expansion of scope for qualifying investment for the preferential tax regimes offered to funds and single-family offices, covering for example precious metals, loans and private credit investments, and digital assets - to maintain this strong growth trajectory.

 Combined with Hong Kong's absence of capital gains tax and estate duty, our tax concession enables families to enhance after-tax returns, preserve wealth across generations, and direct more resources toward philanthropy, legacy-building, and innovative investments. As Asia's leading cross-border wealth hub, Hong Kong provides unmatched tax certainty and access to diverse opportunities.

 We have intensified global outreach through roadshows in the Mainland, Europe, and ASEAN. We are also extensively featured in international media, and conduct direct engagement with ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Our flagship Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit has been a major success. The March edition last year, themed ""Hong Kong of the World, for the World"", brought together influential family office principals to explore technology, artificial intelligence, philanthropy, succession planning, and cultural innovation. Preparations are underway for the next Summit in March this year to sustain this momentum, and reinforce Hong Kong's status as the premier global family office hub.

 In closing, we warmly invite family offices from around the world to join us in Hong Kong. By leveraging our unique advantages - connectivity to the Mainland and the world, robust infrastructure, and a commitment to stewardship - we can together honour family legacies while shaping a prosperous, sustainable future.

 Thank you."
Speech by CE at Consensus Hong Kong 2026 (English only) (with video),2026-02-11 10:30,2026-02-11 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021000642.htm,"Following is the video speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at Consensus Hong Kong 2026 today (February 11):

Mr Michael Lau (Chairman of Consensus), Mr Tom Farley (Chief Executive Officer of Bullish Group), Mr Jay Yarow (President of CoinDesk), industry leaders and innovators, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning, and welcome to Hong Kong. It is my pleasure to join you today at Consensus Hong Kong 2026.

This is a key platform that brings together Web3 leaders from around the world to discuss, and shape, the future of the Web3 ecosystem. I would like to begin by thanking CoinDesk for returning to Hong Kong, hosting this iconic conference once again after last year's success. Your choice underscores Hong Kong's distinct advantages. It also helps to show the world our growing prominence, as a global hub for Web3 and crypto innovation.

Hong Kong is the world's freest economy and one of its three major international financial centres. Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage. We have a long tradition of the rule of law, a judiciary that exercises its power independently, and a common law system that is similar to many financial hubs around the globe. Hong Kong has an open and transparent market, and we enjoy the free flow of capital and a low and simple tax regime.

What's more, Hong Kong's financial regulatory system is robust, and our financial market stands out for its deep liquidity, innovative products and world-class investor protection. As the only city in the world that counts as many as five universities in the global top 100, Hong Kong boasts a highly educated workforce, and a welcoming environment for global talent.

These, and many other advantages, have helped to make Hong Kong the world's number three in global competitiveness, and number four in the World Talent Ranking and World Digital Competitiveness Ranking.

With this unparalleled positioning, Hong Kong has consistently served as a platform that brings together international capital, talent and information, continuing to expand our global markets and reach.

The world of Web3 and digital assets carries with it vast potential. They help to realise more efficient financial transactions, at a lower cost and with more inclusive options. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is committed to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in digital asset. That's why over the past few years, Hong Kong has been actively building the regulatory framework to promote the steady, and sustainable, development of our Web3 ecosystem.

Last June, the HKSAR Government issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong. It sets out a vision for a trusted and innovative digital asset ecosystem - one that prioritises risk management and investor protection, while delivering concrete benefits to the real economy and financial markets.

I'm pleased that a lot of our initiatives in the area are in good progress. One key initiative is our implementation of the Stablecoins Ordinance last August. This new law provides for a licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively processing licensing applications, and we believe the first batch of stablecoin issuer licences will be issued within next month.

Meanwhile, our Securities and Futures Commission announced last year the ""ASPIRe"" roadmap, its plan for regulating Hong Kong's virtual asset (VA) market. We have since implemented a series of measures to boost liquidity of the VA market, and expand VA product offerings and services. All for the purpose of facilitating the development of this vibrant area of growth.

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is in a strong position in promoting Web3 development. Hong Kong will continue to go all out to stay at the forefront of this pivotal shift in finance and technology. We welcome companies and institutions from around the world to join hands with us, and build a brighter digital future together.

On that note, I wish you all a fruitful conference these two days. Do remember to take some time to experience the life and culture of Hong Kong, Asia's world city. With the advent of the Lunar New Year, I wish you a healthy and prosperous Year of the Horse. Thank you.  "

勞工處發言人今日（二月十一日）表示，農曆年假前勞資雙方都要加倍注意工作安全，以防止意外發生。

他說：「農曆新年快到，僱員有可能會受到假期節日氣氛影響，或因趕於長假期前完成工作，而對工作安全有所鬆懈。為避免農曆年假期間及假期後發生嚴重事故，僱主應加強監察，以確保工作場地安全，並透過假期前的安全巡視把潛在危害消除。放長假前的安全措施包括關掉裝置和機器的電源及氣體焊接設備、妥善貯存化學物品及堆放物料、熄滅火種，以及固定臨時搭建物。」

他續說：「管理人員應加強提醒督導人員及僱員，不要因工程緊迫而忽略工作安全，包括沒有做足安全措施、遵循安全步驟或使用個人防護裝備等。在進行不同工序前應經由合資格人員進行風險評估，制訂安全施工方案及監察系統，尤其當工程涉及高危作業，例如高處工作、吊運工作、密閉空間工作、隧道工程和電力工作。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》的一般責任條款規定，僱主必須為其僱員提供安全的工作環境、作業裝置及工作系統。違反有關規定，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁兩年。

此外，僱員亦須合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

如有任何職業安全及健康的查詢，可致電二五四二 二一七二，與勞工處職業安全及健康部聯絡。"
Contractors/employers and employees urged to pay attention to workplace safety before Chinese New Year holidays,2026-02-11 10:00,2026-02-11 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021000569.htm,"  With Chinese New Year around the corner, the Labour Department (LD) urges contractors, employers and employees to be more vigilant and take adequate safety precautions at workplaces before the long holidays.

  A spokesperson for the LD said today (February 11) that employers and employees should pay more attention to work safety before the Chinese New Year holidays to prevent accidents.

  The spokesperson said, ""As Chinese New Year is coming, employees may become less aware of work safety due to the festive atmosphere or may have to rush to complete work before the long holidays. Employers should therefore step up monitoring to ensure workplace safety and eliminate potential hazards through pre-holiday safety inspections, thereby minimising the chance of grave consequences during and after the Chinese New Year holidays. Safety precautions before the holidays include turning off the power for plant and machinery as well as gas welding equipment, proper storage of chemicals and stacking of materials, extinguishing ignition sources and securing temporary structures.

  ""Management should remind supervisors and employees not to compromise work safety for tight work schedules, including failure to take adequate safety precautions, follow safety procedures or use personal protective equipment. Risk assessments should be conducted by competent persons prior to the commencement of different work processes, with safe work method statements formulated and proper monitoring systems in place, especially for works involving high-risk operations, such as working at height, lifting operations, working in confined spaces, tunnelling works and electrical work,"" the spokesperson added.

  Pursuant to the general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, employers shall provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

  Meanwhile, employees shall co-operate by following safety instructions and using safety equipment.

  For any enquiries on occupational safety and health, please contact the LD's Occupational Safety and Health Branch at 2542 2172."

FEHD continues to actively follow up on food poisoning cases related to consumption of raw oysters and steps up inspections of food premises selling raw oysters (with photos),2026-02-10 23:02,2026-02-10 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000937.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (February 10) expressed deep concern over recent food poisoning cases related to the consumption of raw oysters.Officers from the CFS and the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the FEHD immediately conducted investigations at the restaurants concerned, reviewing their food handling procedures and tracing the sources of the oysters. Since February this year, investigations revealed that 10 cases involved the consumption of raw oysters supplied by Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd. of Korea. For the sake of prudence, the CFS instructed the trade to stop the import and sale in Hong Kong of raw oysters supplied by this company on February 5. In addition, the CFS found 11 cases wereinvolved the consumption of raw oysters supplied by the food factory Jeton International Foods and 88 Investment Holdings Limited. The CFS has promptly instructedthe company to suspend the sale and supply of raw oysters, and issued a press release on related follow-up work on February 6, requiring the trade to stop selling oysters supplied by the company concerned. Investigations into other cases, which involve consumption of oysters from various countries, are still ongoing.

In view of the recent surge in food poisoning cases related to the consumption of raw oysters, the FEHD has carried out special operations and stepped up inspections of various licensed or permitted food premises across Hong Kong, thereby safeguarding food safety and protecting public health. The focuses of the inspections included the storage temperature of raw oysters, storage conditions in designated refrigerators, the sources of supply, the personal hygiene of food handlers, the hygienic condition of the premises, verifying source documents and health certificates, and collecting samples for testing. Over the past five days, the FEHD has inspected about 430 food premises selling oysters, providing immediate advice on food storage, handling and environmental hygiene. Inspections will continue to ensure licensees/permittees comply with licensing conditions and statutory hygiene standards.

The spokesman reminded that as oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater and absorbing suspended food particles therein, bacteria (e.g. Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus) and viruses (e.g. norovirus and Hepatitis A virus) may accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Consuming oysters without thorough cooking might risk direct intake of these microorganisms. Susceptible groups, such as pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, should avoid eating them.

​Consumers are advised to purchase or consume oysters only from food premises licensed or permitted by the FEHD. The trade and food handlers should understand the importance of adhering to good personal hygiene and proper food handling, and provide regular training on hygiene practices and norovirus-related risks. Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food. Separate utensils and cutting boards should be used for raw and ready-to-eat foods, with regular cleaning and disinfection. Food handlers who exhibit symptoms of infection should refrain from handling food until they have been symptom-free for at least 48 hours."
FEHD combats unsatisfactory hygiene conditions and serious rodent infestations in fresh provision shops,2026-02-10 22:35,2026-02-10 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000794.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (February 10) that, the department has been placing great importance to food safety and environmental hygiene. It will not tolerate fresh provision shops (FPSs) that flout regulations, mishandle pig carcasses, and cause serious rodent infestations that threaten public health. The FEHD will step up blitz operations across districts to clamp down on violating FPSs.

The spokesman pointed out that, during recent late-night special operations along Lok Shan Road in To Kwa Wan and Kowloon City Road, the FEHD discovered that a FPS had poor hygiene condition and serious rodent infestation. To protect public health, the FEHD issued an immediate closure order on January 24 under the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance, requiring the shop to immediately cease operation, and carry out thorough cleansing and rodent control. The shop will only be allowed to reopen once the FEHD is satisfied with its hygiene condition. The shop requested the lifting of the closure order on February 6, but as its hygiene condition and rodent control measures remained unsatisfactory, the request was rejected by the FEHD, and the closure order remains in effect.

In addition, the FEHD has carried out special operations across all districts early this month, stepping up inspections of more than 250 licensed FPSs, and taking stringent enforcement actions against irregularities that increase the risk of rodent infestation, with a view to safeguarding food safety and public health. During the special operations, the FEHD staff initiated 47 prosecutions and issued 101 verbal warnings/advice against the FPSs concerned.

The spokesman said that the FEHD will continue to inspect FPSs regularly. To further combat the poor hygiene or serious rodent problems of shops, the department will step up late-night blitz operations across districts. If FPSs are found mishandling pig carcasses in ways that lead to rodent infestation, the FEHD will not hesitate to issue immediate closure orders and cancel their licences to protect public health.

Under the relevant regulation, every person engaged in any food business, including FPSs, shall not knowingly suffer or permit in any food premises, the presence of rats, mice or insects; and shall adopt appropriate measures to protect the food from risk of contamination or deterioration. Operators must at all times keep every part of food premises clean, properly maintained, and in good condition. Offenders are liable to prosecution and a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months. All meat delivered to licensed FPSs must be directly delivered into the licensed premises; otherwise, it constitutes a breach of licensing conditions and may result in immediate licence cancellation. Furthermore, if the condition of a premises poses an imminent health risk, the FEHD has the authority to issue closure orders and immediately close the premises."

鑑於近期與進食生蠔相關的食物中毒個案有所上升，食環署在全港各區採取特別行動，加強巡查全港多個持牌食物業處所，以保障食物安全及公眾健康。巡查的重點包括生蠔的保存溫度、存放在指定雪櫃內的情況、生蠔的供應來源、食物處理人員的個人衞生及食物業處所的衞生情況、查核生蠔的來源文件和衞生證明書，以及抽檢生蠔樣本作檢測等。過去五天，食環署已巡視全港約430間出售生蠔的食物業處所，其間就食物的存放、處理和衞生情況作出即時衞生建議。巡查會繼續進行，確保持牌／持證人或相關負責人遵守有關牌照或許可證條件，並符合法例訂明的衞生標準。

發言人提醒，由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水、吸收在海水中懸浮食物粒子的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有細菌（例如副溶血性弧菌和創傷弧菌）及病毒（例如諾如病毒和甲型肝炎病毒），這些物質會在蠔的體內積聚。進食未經徹底煮熟的蠔可能會有直接攝入這些微生物的風險，孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士及肝病患者等容易受感染的人士，應避免進食。

消費者應到持有食環署牌照／受限制食物售賣許可證的食物業處所購買或進食生蠔。業界及食物處理人員應了解遵循良好個人衞生習慣和妥善處理食物的重要性，並定期培訓員工有關良好衞生規範及與諾如病毒相關的風險。處理食物前後應用梘液及清水徹底洗手最少20秒，以及使用獨立的器具和砧板處理生食及即食食物，定時清潔和消毒。出現感染症狀的食物處理人員須於症狀消失最少48小時後才再次處理食物。"

財經事務及庫務局常任秘書長（財經事務）在香港銀行學會第18屆「傑出財富管理師大獎」頒獎典禮暨晚宴致辭（只有中文）,2026-02-10 21:28,2026-02-10 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000801.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局常任秘書長（財經事務）甄美薇今日（二月十日）在香港銀行學會第18屆「傑出財富管理師大獎」頒獎典禮暨晚宴致辭：

Arthur（香港銀行學會理事會主席兼香港金融管理局副總裁阮國恒）、勞總監（澳門金融管理局金融發展廳代總監勞婷沁）、Carrie（香港銀行學會行政總裁梁嘉麗）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。感謝香港銀行學會的邀請，讓我有機會出席這個年度盛事。「傑出財富管理師大獎」今年來到第18屆，歷年為銀行業樹立許多行業榜樣，並不斷因應行業發展加入新的評核元素，推動香港以至大灣區整體財富管理水平不斷提升，為業界與客戶帶來莫大裨益。

我知道各位得獎者都要經過嚴格的篩選才能獲獎，我衷心祝賀所有得獎者。您們的成就不僅是對個人專業能力的肯定，亦是對財富管理行業整體水準的認可。

香港是領先國際金融中心，我們一直通過不同措施，加強香港資產及財富管理業的競爭力。今天，我希望藉這個機會與大家分享香港在推動資產及財富管理行業發展的最新政策和方向。

根據香港證監會（證券及期貨事務監察委員會）的最新統計，截至二○二四年年底，香港的資產及財富管理業務總值按年增加百分之十三至超過35萬億港元。這良好勢頭在二○二五年持續，在香港註冊成立的證監會認可基金去年全年錄得的淨資金流入超過3,500億港元。

為配合資產及財富管理業業界的發展趨勢和需要，創造有利增長的環境，政府會於二○二六年上半年向立法會提交條例草案，優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠稅制，吸引更多有潛力的基金和家族辦公室來港落戶。

具體而言，我們會拓寬免稅制度下「基金」的定義，涵蓋退休基金及捐贈基金，增加基金及單一家族辦公室享有稅務寬減的合資格投資種類，以涵蓋碳排放相關的產品、保險相連證券、貸款、私募債權投資、貴金屬和數字資產等。另外，我們亦會優化分發附帶權益的稅務寬減安排。

我們已提前完成在《行政長官2022年施政報告》所訂立在二○二五年年底前協助不少於200間家族辦公室在香港設立或擴展業務的目標。今日發表的《香港家族辦公室市場研究》顯示，截至二○二五年年底，香港的單一家族辦公室數目已超過3 380間，兩年內增加超過680間，升幅超過百分之二十五。此外，「新資本投資者入境計劃」自推出以來反應熱烈，已接獲超過3 000宗申請，預計可為香港帶來逾900億港元投資。

我們希望透過這些措施，在現今地緣政治充滿不確定性的環境下，便利世界各地的投資者和家族辦公室善用香港穩定和在「一國兩制」下的獨特制度優勢，在港進行及管理資產配置業務。

與此同時，我們正落實其他一系列推動金融業發展的措施，為資產及財富管理行業帶來新的發展機遇。

其中，政府正銳意推動黃金交易的發展，把香港建設成為國際黃金交易中心，吸引黃金現貨在香港儲存、清算和交割，從而帶動全產業鏈的發展。我們亦會推動市場開發更豐富的黃金投資工具，開發新產品，為投資者提供更多元化的投資選擇，增強市場的流動性，提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，同時為財富管理行業帶來新的增長點。

另外，跨境理財通是粵港澳大灣區金融市場雙向開放的重要載體，不僅為內地、香港和澳門居民搭建規範而便捷的跨境財富管理渠道，更推動三地財富管理行業實現資源互補、市場聯通，為行業發展開拓更廣闊的市場空間。二○二四年推出的「理財通2.0」優化版，帶動投資者人數及跨境匯劃金額實現顯著增長，分別達17.7萬人和超過1,310億元人民幣。優化措施既豐富了大灣區居民的資產配置選擇，更注入新動能，推動內地資本與金融要素有序流動，鞏固香港的國際資產管理中心地位，亦促進灣區民生金融深度融合。

我很高興知道香港銀行學會一直與時俱進，在設計培訓內容及「傑出財富管理師大獎」的評核準則時，融入最新的政策發展，並透過培訓與案例研討，幫助從業人員深入理解這些新興領域。

香港特區政府於二○二五至二六年度《財政預算案》中提出持續推動綠色和可持續金融發展，並透過延長「綠色和可持續金融培訓先導計劃」，加強本地相關人才培育。學會積極於培訓課程中融入相關元素，協助學員把政策理念轉化為實務應用個案，鼓勵業界將ESG（環境、社會及管治）元素融入營運、投資及財務策劃之中，提升從業人員的專業素質，也為行業的持續發展注入新的活力。

今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，我們期待與業界一起貢獻國家的經濟發展。我相信，在政府、業界和各位得獎者的共同努力下，我們的金融、銀行和財富管理行業將迎來更輝煌的發展。

最後，再次衷心恭賀各位得獎者，期望您們未來在財務計劃及財富管理專業領域繼續大放異彩。我祝願頒獎典禮及晚宴圓滿成功，各位業界仝人在馬年工作順利、身體健康、業務興旺、馬到功成。多謝大家！"
食環署全力打擊衞生欠佳及鼠患嚴重的新鮮糧食店,2026-02-10 20:45,2026-02-10 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000793.htm,"​食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（二月十日）表示，署方高度重視食物安全和環境衞生，對於早前有新鮮糧食店漠視法規，不當處理豬隻屠體，導致店內鼠患嚴重，影響市民健康的情況絕不容忍。署方將加強在各區採取突擊行動，取締違規的新鮮糧食店。

發言人指出，食環署近日在土瓜灣落山道和九龍城道一帶採取深宵特別行動，發現一間名為「金寶肉食公司」的新鮮糧食店衞生不佳並且鼠患嚴重。為保障公眾健康，署方已在一月二十四日根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》向店鋪發出即時封閉令，勒令其即時暫停營業，徹底清潔和消毒有關處所，並進行有效滅鼠工作，直到署方滿意其衞生情況，方會考慮批准其重新營業。該店鋪曾於二月六日提出解封要求，但由於店內的衞生狀況及滅鼠措施仍未達標，因此署方已拒絕其解封要求，該封閉令至目前為止仍然生效。

此外，食環署已於本月初在全港各區採取特別行動，加強巡查超過250間持牌新鮮糧食店，嚴厲打擊增加鼠患風險的違規情況，以保障食物安全和公眾健康。在特別行動中，署方人員就違規情況向相關新鮮糧食店共作出101次口頭警告／勸喻，以及提出47宗檢控。

發言人表示，食環署會持續巡查新鮮糧食店。為進一步打擊衞生不佳甚至鼠患嚴重的店鋪，署方未來會加強在各區採取深宵突擊行動，若發現有新鮮糧食店不當處理豬隻屠體導致鼠患，會毫不猶疑向店鋪發出即時封閉令及取消其牌照，以保障市民健康。

根據相關法例，任何從事食物業人士，包括新鮮糧食店，不得明知而容受或准許任何食物業處所內有老鼠或昆蟲存在；而且須採取一切合理地需要的措施保護食物，以免食物受到污染或變壞。經營者亦須時刻保持食物業處所各部分清潔、維修妥善和狀況良好。違例者會被檢控，最高刑罰為罰款一萬元及監禁三個月。所有運送到持牌新鮮糧食店的肉類，均須直接送進該持牌處所內，否則違反牌照條件，會被即時取消牌照。此外，如處所情況構成對健康的即時危害，食環署有權作出封閉令，立即封閉該處所。"
"DSJ promotes Hong Kong's common law system and strengths in legal, financial and other professional services in Indonesia (with photos)",2026-02-10 20:18,2026-02-10 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000763.htm,"The Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, attended an international forum in Jakarta, Indonesia, today (February 10) and met with local political and business leaders to promote Hong Kong's advantages in legal, financial, and other professional services under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. He emphasised that Hong Kong would continue to play the role of ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to strengthen ties between the Chinese Mainland and member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

In the morning, Dr Cheung attended the China Conference: Southeast Asia 2026, where he shared insights with political and business communities on how Hong Kong's unique strengths can help consolidate and develop economic and trade partnerships with fast-growing economies like Indonesia.

Dr Cheung noted that Hong Kong's distinctive advantages could be highlighted in four aspects. First, ""irreplaceable""; Hong Kong serves as an irreplaceable bridge for Indonesian and ASEAN enterprises looking to the market of the Chinese Mainland, and for Chinese companies venturing into Southeast Asia's markets. Second, ""interconnected""; as an international financial centre, Hong Kong is deeply interconnected in financial, legal, and other professional fields, reflecting the international best practice. Third, ""innovative""; Hong Kong keeps abreast of innovative policies, supporting the development of different industry sectors. For example, initiatives enabling multinational corporations to relocate their domicile to Hong Kong and enjoy the city's simple and low tax regime. Fourth, ""indispensable""; the common law system is a cornerstone of Hong Kong's success. With a robust rule of law environment, a bilingual common law system which is internationally compatible as well as clear and transparent laws, Hong Kong is an indispensable international legal hub offering strong and reliable legal support for sophisticated cross-border investments.

Dr Cheung said that Hong Kong stood ready to collaborate with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries by leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages to promote shared prosperity across Asia.

During the Conference, Dr Cheung met with the Chargé d'Affaires ad Interim of the Embassy to the People’s Republic of China to the Republic of Indonesia, Mr Zhou Kan. Dr Cheung expressed gratitude to Mr Zhou for his support on the work of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. Dr Cheung remarked that the Department of Justice had been fully supporting Mainland enterprises in leveraging Hong Kong to go global and rolled out the Hong Kong Professional Services GoGlobal Platform and the ""Collection of Success Stories: Hong Kong's Professional Services Supporting Chinese Mainland Enterprises Going Global"" about two months ago. During the visit, Dr Cheung also visited a Mainland-invested enterprise which had leveraged Hong Kong's professional services to go global successfully in Indonesia. He exchanged views with their senior management on the measures of the Platform in supporting Mainland enterprises.

Dr Cheung also met with the Chairwoman of the Indonesian Employers' Association, Ms Shinta Widjaja Kamdani. Dr Cheung indicated that Hong Kong enjoyed both China advantages and international advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. He encouraged Indonesian businesses to leverage the city's high-quality professional services, including international legal and financial services, to set up regional business headquarters in Hong Kong and to seize new opportunities under the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development.

In addition, Dr Cheung had a luncheon with leaders from the commercial, financial, and innovation and technology sectors in Indonesia and nearby regions to exchange views on how to better facilitate commercial ties and collaboration between Hong Kong and Indonesia.

In the evening, Dr Cheung attended a Chinese New Year cocktail reception hosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO) in Jakarta. Dr Cheung delivered a speech to over 100 guests from the local government, business, academic, cultural and media sectors. He encouraged them to fully leverage Hong Kong's advantages to explore more business opportunities and strengthen collaboration in the new year, and to deepen the partnership between Hong Kong and Indonesia.

Before the reception, the Director-General of the HKETO in Jakarta, Miss Libera Cheng, updated Dr Cheung on the HKETO's work. She said that the establishment of the HKETO in Kuala Lumpur in December 2025 has further strengthened Hong Kong's relations with ASEAN countries. With Indonesia being ASEAN's largest economy, the HKETO in Jakarta will continue to enhance promotion work in the region, with a view to fostering bilateral economic, trade and people-to-people ties.

Dr Cheung will visit the China Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia tomorrow (February 11) before concluding his visit and returning to Hong Kong."
律政司副司長在印尼推廣香港普通法制度及法律和金融等專業服務優勢（附圖）,2026-02-10 20:18,2026-02-10 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000779.htm,"律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（二月十日）在印尼雅加達出席國際論壇，並會晤當地政商界人士，推廣香港在「一國兩制」下在法律、金融等專業服務的優勢，強調香港會積極擔當「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，促進中國內地與東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）成員國的聯繫。

早上，張國鈞出席東南亞中國年會2026，就香港的獨特優勢如何助力鞏固和發展與印尼等快速崛起的新興市場的經貿夥伴關係，向在場政商界人士分享看法。

他表示，香港的獨特優勢可以體現於四個層面：首先是「不可替代」，香港是印尼以至東盟成員國企業開拓中國內地市場及中國內地企業進軍東南亞市場不可替代的橋樑；第二，「互聯互通」，香港作為國際金融樞紐，在金融和法律等專業領域高度互聯，並反映國際最佳做法；第三，「創新」，香港的創新政策與時並進，積極支持不同界別的發展。例如，跨國企業遷冊來港後能享受香港的簡單低稅制；第四，「不可或缺」，普通法制度是香港賴以成功的關鍵，香港的法治穩健，中英雙語的普通法制度與國際接軌，法律清晰透明，為跨國投資提供穩健法律保障，是不可或缺的國際法律樞紐。

張國鈞表示，香港期望通過發揮其獨特優勢，與印尼及其他東盟國家攜手合作，推動亞洲地區共建繁榮。

論壇舉行期間，張國鈞與中國駐印尼大使館臨時代辦周侃公使會面，感謝他支持香港特別行政區政府的工作。他提到，律政司正全力支持內企借港出海，約兩個月前更推出「香港專業服務出海平台」及《香港專業服務助力中國內地企業出海成功案例實錄》，而此行他亦到訪一家借助香港專業服務成功出海並立足印尼的內地投資企業，與管理層就平台支持內企的措施交換意見。

張國鈞亦會晤印尼僱主協會主席Shinta Widjaja Kamdani。他表示，香港在「一國兩制」下擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，歡迎印尼商界善用香港優質的專業服務，包括國際法律及金融服務，在香港設立區域業務總部，開拓「一帶一路」及粵港澳大灣區的機遇。

此外，張國鈞與來自印尼和鄰近地區的工商、金融、創科領袖共進午餐，就香港專業服務如何更好促進香港與印尼之間的商業聯繫和合作互相交流。

傍晚，他出席香港駐雅加達經濟貿易辦事處（駐雅加達經貿辦）舉辦的新春酒會，向逾百名當地政商、學術、文化和傳媒人士發表演說，鼓勵他們新一年充分利用香港的優勢發掘更多商機、探索更多合作，並深化香港和印尼的夥伴關係。

酒會前，駐雅加達經貿辦處長鄭青文向張國鈞簡介經貿辦工作。她表示，香港駐吉隆坡經貿辦已於去年十二月成立，進一步加強香港與東盟各國的關係。她指，印尼是東盟最大經濟體，駐雅加達經貿辦會繼續深化在當地的推廣工作，推動兩地經貿和人文聯繫。

明日（二月十一日），張國鈞將到訪印尼中國商會總會，隨後結束訪問行程啟程回港。"
