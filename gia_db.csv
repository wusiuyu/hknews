Speech by STL at International Conference on Roads and Railways 2025 (English only),2025-06-12 16:15,2025-06-12 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200555.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the International Conference on Roads and Railways 2025 today (June 12):

Alfred (President of the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation, Mr Alfred Leung), Gary (Legislative Council Member, Mr Gary Zhang), Vice President Wang (Vice President of the Research Institute of Highway of the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China Mr Wang Shuiyin), representatives from Consulates-General, distinguished guests, esteemed speakers, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to the International Conference on Roads and Railways 2025, to discuss ""Building Smart and Green Transport Infrastructure"". It is indeed a very precious occasion for such a diverse and accomplished group of industry leaders, global experts, and innovators from around the world to gather together to exchange knowledge, share innovative practices and explore cutting-edge technologies. Taking this opportunity, I would like to share with you the exciting journey of Hong Kong's transport infrastructure development, a journey that embodies our relentless pursuit of excellence - from innovation to expedition.

Vision of Hong Kong transport development

No journey would be easy without a vision. Hong Kong's vision is to build a livable, competitive and sustainable city by driving development through transport infrastructure, guided by the planning principles of ""infrastructure-led"" and ""capacity-building"". Our goal is to establish a diverse and highly efficient public transport system, with railways as our backbone complemented by an extensive road network, meeting our commuting demands while supporting the city's long-term development. We also actively promote cross-boundary integration with the Mainland, especially with other cities in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area), seamlessly linking Hong Kong with our motherland and facilitating our integration into national development.

With this vision in mind, we have been implementing transport infrastructure in full strength which has become the key to Hong Kong's long-term development, and we never stop being the trailblazer. Just to quote two examples officially recorded in the Guinness World Records, the Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong, constructed back in 1997, remains the longest suspension-bridge span for combined road and railway traffic in use nowadays with a main span of 1 377 meters. The second one is the tunnel boring machine (TBM) named ""Qin Liangyu"" used in the excavation of the Tuen Mun - Chek Lap Kok Tunnel in 2019 which holds the title of the largest TBM in the world, boasting a shield diameter of 17.63m - equivalent to the height of a six-story building. These are undeniably a testament to Hong Kong’s engineering excellence.

Adoption of the dual-innovation mindset

In developing transport infrastructure, while quality and safety have always been our top priorities, we also keep three key principles in mind: saving costs, speeding up delivery and maximising social benefits. To push ourselves to aim higher, think bigger and go further, we embrace the dual-innovation mindset, combining policy and technology innovation in implementing transport infrastructure projects.

In the next few minutes, let me to take you on a virtual tour of our compact yet vibrant city, where a wide range of infrastructure projects are being driven forward with the dual-innovation mindset at their core.

Policy innovation

First, on the policy front, as a city developed over decades, Hong Kong's robust system is accompanied by protocols accumulated over time. It is therefore paramount that we continuously evolve our regulatory environment to respond swiftly to emerging challenges and embrace opportunities. Over the past two years, we have streamlined statutory procedures to shorten infrastructure projects, enabling us to address social needs more promptly.

We do not confine ourselves to the traditional delivery mode. Take the unexpected rise of the national AI model DeepSeek as an example; it has now become the benchmark in China's technology sector. By staying open to cutting-edge ideas, we drive progress. Hence, we constantly explore innovative solutions to advance transport infrastructures.

Holistic planning and phased implementation

Let us now turn our attention to the Northern Metropolis, Hong Kong's future new growth engine, which was also highlighted earlier by our Financial Secretary this morning. The Northern Metropolis Highway (NM Highway) is by far the largest single road project in Hong Kong. Consisting of four major road sections, it will serve as a major route for the new development areas in the Northern Metropolis in the future. Unlike the conventional practice of implementing the road sections separately based on individual district's transport demands, we are carrying out the planning and advancing works for the entire NM Highway as one integrated project. This includes optimising of alignment, completing statutory procedures, and conducting site investigations, among all other tasks. As transport demand arises in specific road schemes subject to ongoing development, we can promptly begin detailed design and construction works once funding is secured, translating to a much more efficient delivery.

Alternative procurement methods

The recently introduced Smart and Green Mass Transit Systems, in short, SGMTS projects, are underway in three totally different areas of Hong Kong. First, it is within the long-developed and bustling Kowloon East with its hilly terrain; if I remember correctly, I just signed off the gazette plan for the whole section of the Kowloon East Line yesterday, which is a whole bunch of large maps covering different areas along the Kowloon East, and by the way, I was travelling along the Kowloon East this morning because of the traffic congestion. It was a really bustling area and I can see the various new stations and the adjustment in the alignments as embedded in those gazette plans. Second, as for the Kai Tak district, a newly transformed residential and business area built on the old airport runway; and thirdly is the developing Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen area located in the northwest part of the city. Each area has very different topographies and community needs. This diversity exemplifies our new approach of adopting alternative procurement methods to enhance cost-effectiveness and encourage innovative proposals from the private sector.

This new approach leverages various procurement options, including ""design-and-build"" and ""early contractor involvement"" models, again, to improve project efficiency and maximise social benefits. By inviting system suppliers and operators to submit expressions of interest early, we can optimise project constructability and streamline delivery. It is particularly valuable for the SGMTS, which brings in new technologies, new procurement methods and operational models in the city, requiring close co-ordination across design, construction, and operation stages.

Cross-boundary collaboration

Turning to the collaboration with our motherland. To facilitate cross-boundary transportation and support the ""one-hour living circle"" in the Greater Bay Area, we have been strengthening transport links between Hong Kong and the Mainland. Beyond the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and the Express Rail Link, we are working with the Mainland authorities to jointly develop two very important cross-boundary railway projects, building the ""Greater Bay Area on the Rail"".

The Task Force for Hong Kong and Shenzhen Co-operation on Cross-Boundary Railway Infrastructure was established by the Hong Kong Government and Shenzhen Municipal People's Government to take forward key projects, including the above-mentioned two important projects, i.e. the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link (Hung Shui Kiu - Qianhai) and the Northern Link Spur Line, ensuring co-ordinated planning, design, and construction efforts. These projects will boost connectivity between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, ease passenger flow, drive the regional economy, and solidify Hong Kong as a pivotal Greater Bay Area transportation hub.

This collaborative approach not only accelerates project delivery and enhances design compatibility, but also lets us tap into proprietary technologies and construction methods developed on the Mainland. While the differences in the design standards and construction practices between the two places can be challenging, we are absolutely confident that this will open up new opportunities and we would work steadfastly to embrace this challenge and opportunity. We will explore how to incorporate Mainland approaches into our cross-boundary railways projects - such as adopting their design standards and construction specifications where appropriate - so we can blend Hong Kong's versatility with the Mainland's strengths in infrastructure. Together, these efforts illustrate the strong commitment from both governments to build a seamless, efficient railway network across the Greater Bay Area, helping to deepen the regional integration and expand living circle.

Technological innovation

The other core pillar of the dual-innovation mindset is technological innovation. As we stand on the brink of a new era, advanced technologies are reshaping roads and railways development, making it very crucial to fully harness their transformative potential. 

Adoption of advanced technology

Our city has long invested in cutting-edge technologies to drive efficiency and sustainability. The three SGMTS projects I have mentioned before are prime examples of our commitment, by combining green and smart technologies, to improve transport efficiency, safety and convenience. These systems use energy-efficient solutions and real-time data to manage traffic, adjust services and keep passengers informed, lifting up the overall commuting experience. I know that my colleagues are working very hard in preparing for the tender invitation for these smart and green innovative systems. Not only do we have to focus on the technologies and construction, we also have to embrace and consolidate passenger needs on real-time traffic data and the deployment of this kind of train to facilitate the integration of their commuting with the heavy rail or any other public transports as well.

Smart motorways

Our city by far has done a lot in smart motorways as well. I am sure our friends from afar will experience firsthand the vibrant and well-connected motorways in Hong Kong. However, this also presents challenges in maintaining its resilience. To enhance the road network's robustness and make the best use of our road space, that’s where the artificial intelligence comes in. Our full-coverage Automatic Incident Detection System can quickly spot traffic incidents, stationary vehicles, or other road issues. It then responds swiftly using variable messages and speed limit signs, and even opening the hard shoulder when needed. This significantly improves our efficiency in handling incidents, and how far and how fast we can respond to them.

Use of digital site supervision

Digital technologies are now seamlessly integrated throughout the entire project lifecycle of our public works projects. The Digital Works Supervision System (DWSS) has been widely adopted to enhance site safety, workmanship and contract management efficiency. Currently, over 180 public works contracts valued at more than HK$200 billion are using the DWSS, engaging over 10 000 users from the Government and the industry. A highlight is the Central Kowloon Route project, led by the Highways Department. Located in the heart of Kowloon, it connects the world-famous Temple Street with the Kai Tak area, reducing a journey that once took 30 minutes to just five minutes. This project is the first to unify data from six separate contracts into a single integrated platform. This allows real-time monitoring of site activities and automatic generation of key performance indicators, boosting construction efficiency and reducing the need for on-site supervisors. The local industry has widely recognised the project's success as a pioneering step in our digital transformation journey. I know that many of the guests and speakers will be invited to a site visit to our Central Kowloon Route project which is expected to be commissioned in the latter half of this year.

Development and use of new materials

Innovation doesn't stop at technology. We are also embracing new materials and engineering solutions to improve productivity and quality. Our tour now takes us to the east side of Hong Kong - Tseung Kwan O, a dense residential and industrial area with around 400 000 residents. Surrounded by hills and the sea, it is relatively secluded, which is why we built the Cross Bay Link (CBL) to improve its connectivity. This CBL is our first marine viaduct with cycle path and footway, we used high-strength steel for its double-arch steel design for the first time locally. The material choice for the arch, along with other innovations such as prefabricated elements that reduce on-site risks, helped cut out carbon emissions by 30 000 tonnes. The CBL has become another iconic landmark, and notably, it won the Institute of Civil Engineers' Brunel Award in 2021 for its excellence in decarbonisation.

Building on this success, we partnered with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to develop a range of new paving materials tailored to different road types. These materials offer enhanced durability and safety, and have now been fully rolled out across suitable locations across the territory, significantly elevating the overall quality of road pavement and driving comfort. I am not sure whether you have the opportunity to tour some of our booths which I am sure will display some of the innovative materials, but our departments and companies in Hong Kong will certainly have a lot of opportunities to adopt solutions to embrace overseas innovative expertise so as to consolidate and create synergy in future railway projects.

Concluding remarks

Hong Kong has taken pride in its transport efficiency, with our public transport system consistently ranking among the top in the world. We are really leading in the world, no doubt about it. Recently, Hong Kong was crowned the city with the best public transport in the world, achieving a near-perfect 98 per cent satisfaction rate among local residents. And do remember this, this award was not given by or calculated by public institutions, it was all given by our local residents based on a survey which gathered their opinions. They voted for us, our public and our locals voted for our local public transport system.

Our journey is not over yet, we have certainly come a long way. Looking ahead, we have got to keep innovating and staying flexible to keep up with the city's evolving needs. Hong Kong will and always has been a trailblazer, and with our dual-innovation mindset, we are ready to keep pushing the boundaries. We do not underestimate the challenges ahead, and they call for bold and fresh ideas. Luckily, this conference is the perfect platform to swap stories, build partnerships and spark the creativity that will shape the next generation of roads and railways.

At the end of my little virtual tour with you today, I would like to extend again my deepest gratitude to all the speakers, guests and participants who have joined us today. Your expertise and insights are vital to advancing our shared vision for a sustainable and efficient transport system. I wish you all a very inspiring and rewarding conference, as well as an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."

​立法會：運輸及物流局局長就《2025年道路交通（修訂）條例草案》恢復二讀辯論致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-06-12 15:13,2025-06-12 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200517.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（六月十二日）在立法會會議上就《2025年道路交通（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）恢復二讀辯論的致辭全文：

主席：

首先，我要感謝《2025年道路交通（修訂）條例草案》法案委員會主席易志明議員以及14位議員審議《條例草案》的工作。我亦感謝剛才發言的每位議員支持《條例草案》。

運輸及物流局和運輸署一直以來以創新牌照管理為願景，與時並進，為市民提供優質服務。過去數年，我們積極透過電子化，革新運輸署牌照服務，包括配合「智方便」認證推出超過20項網上牌照申請、推出「牌證易」個人化電子牌照平台等，以進一步提高運作效率，減少市民親身辦理手續的需要及輪候的時間。我樂見近年越來越多市民上網使用運輸署的服務，包括申請、續牌、牌照查詢等。車輛牌證方面，市民上網使用服務的佔比由二○二四年年底的17%增至今年第一季的25%；駕照方面，市民上網使用服務的佔比由去年年底的40%增至今年第一季的50%；而國際駕駛執照方面，自推出短短四個月便由去年年底的44%增加至55%。未來，我們會繼續推出不同的電子牌照措施，包括將網上申請進一步延伸至另外20項許可證及證明書。

事實上，現時網上申請的處理時間是10個工作天，以完成和寄出牌證。如果過程能全面自動化，包括用人工智能核對申請資料，如地址證明，從而減少人手需要，運輸署可進一步將處理時間縮短至少於三日。這回應剛才多位議員提及，我們透過實施電子牌證安排，達至智慧政府管理的重要目標。

今次修訂《道路交通條例》的目的，是為了推行電子駕駛執照，這也是運輸署牌照電子化非常重要的一步。《條例草案》的主要內容包括引入可透過指定電子平台展示的電子駕照，以符合攜帶或出示駕駛執照供檢查的法定要求；另一方面，今次修例亦包括駕駛教師的電子執照。

運輸署會在電子駕照手機應用程式中採用多項安全措施，包括禁止使用螢幕截圖、展示載有動態的運輸署標誌，以及使用設有時限倒數的加密二維碼等，以協助執法人員檢驗電子駕照的真確性。而為了防止偽造，《條例草案》亦訂明偽造電子駕照的罪行。

在法案委員會審議《條例草案》的過程中，有議員提出電子駕照措施應該進一步邁向無紙化，例如可以讓駕駛執照持有人自行選擇是否需要實體版駕照，甚至訂定不再發出實體版的目標時間。事實上，發展電子駕駛執照是國際趨勢，但鑑於電子駕駛執照現時在其他國家的普及性程度不一、互聯網覆蓋率和智能手機的使用率等因素，現時已推出電子駕駛執照的國家／地區，例如內地、美國、澳洲和新加坡，仍然會發出實體駕駛執照。我們考慮到這些因素，亦考慮到本地駕照持有人需時習慣及適應，我們建議先採取「雙軌並行」的模式，讓電子駕照以附加選項的形式推出，以協助市民適應及方便於香港以外地方使用實體駕照。香港是國際城市，除了本地居民，亦有不同外籍人士在港使用駕駛執照，亦可能會在不同地方需要使用實體駕照駕駛。這方面我們會以民為本，希望以創新的方式配合國際發展趨勢。所以在電子駕照推出後，我們會密切留意用戶的使用情況和世界各地的發展趨勢，積極檢視未來的發展方向。

有議員關注政府電子駕照流動應用程式應該整合。事實上，我們的目標與議員的看法一致，以便利市民。運輸署於去年底推出的「牌證易」，正是整合部門提供的個人化電子牌照服務，讓市民可一站式管理其名下的牌證和車輛。即使非「智方便」用戶，例如非香港居民或公司，亦可便捷地使用「牌證易」。至於提供公眾交通信息的層面，包括出行路線和時間、泊車及停車收費錶位置等資料，運輸署透過「香港出行易」手機程式予以整合，便利市民查閱。

如果大家記得，運輸署在二○一八年七月推出第一代「香港出行易」程式，二○二一年三月推出全新版，將原有三個手機應用程式進行整合，方便市民一站式搜尋不同出行方式的路線、行車時間、交通費用等資訊。直至二○二五年五月，運輸署的整合版「香港出行易」手機應用程式，下載次數已經突破282萬，每日點擊率高達19萬人次，視乎當日是否正常出行日、是否有特別事故等。基於這些應用程式在較早期率先推出，剛才聽到不少議員期望我們再進一步整合。我們的確會平衡用家需要，希望整合程式能方便市民尋找資訊，但另一方面亦不希望置放過多不同資料在內，令搜尋有困難。內地的一些應用程式，的確是我們一個很好的參考模式。

至於電子駕照的定位，是以手機流動應用程式運作，專門用作向執法人員快速展示用戶的駕照。駕照持有人在下載應用程式後，便可便捷地透過「智方便」或「牌證易」平台完成身分認證程序，就可以連結至電子駕照；非香港居民或公司可使用「牌證易」登入和使用電子駕照。

「牌證易」是運輸署在二○二四年十二月推出，以網頁模式運作，讓持證人在不同情況下，例如透過桌面電腦、手提電腦、手機等，均可登入和管理牌證。這是「牌證易」與電子駕照在設計上的分別。

基於上述原因，運輸署目前會同時運作「牌證易」網頁平台和電子駕照手機應用程式，並會積極檢討有關安排，持續完善服務。

有議員關注有關電子駕照的執法問題。正如我們在法案委員會會議向各位委員講解，現行法例已有相關條文充分保障被要求出示駕照的人士，包括實體駕照及將來的電子駕照。

現行條文第42（2）條提到駕駛者在道路上駕駛汽車時必須攜帶執照。條文已經訂明，任何人沒有合法權限或合理辯解而違反該條，即屬犯罪。因此，在現行法例中已有提供合理辯解的機會。剛才盧偉國議員提及法例罰則的合理性和相互性。我們聽到有關意見。除了在會議提交的解釋，在法例實施後，我們會在適當時候認真檢視。

陳紹雄議員在剛才的發言中亦多次提及希望執法兼備法理情、人性化。除了推廣，執法亦是整個計劃和措施落地的重要一環。警務人員在執法時會按法例的規定，也會按其工作指引及當時的實際情況，作出合適的執法行動。如將來在檢查電子駕照時，司機因手機網絡問題等以致無法出示其電子駕照，警務人員可按當時情況作合適的處理。律政司也會按照一貫做法，考慮所有相關因素才作出檢控決定。運輸署與警務處必然會緊密合作，確保前線執法人員有清晰的指引，務求法例可有效執法，亦不會過分擾民，令措施能在方便市民使用的情況下，平衡各方面的考慮。

如《條例草案》獲得議員通過，電子駕照將於今年九月中開始實施，時間相當緊迫。運輸署將會透過多元途徑，向公眾，特別是駕照持有人，進行廣泛推廣，除了傳統的宣傳單張、橫幅，我們會積極通過運輸署網站、社交媒體和運輸業界通訊等，大力宣傳。

剛才有幾位議員特別提到，駕駛執照持有人有很多是「搵食車」界別。剛才易志明議員和劉業強議員提到，我很希望在這方面請議員幫幫忙，與業界組織攜手舉辦工作坊，特別為一些年紀大的，甚至沒有智能手機的，提供貼身服務，幫助他們使用手機及下載應用程式，從而讓他們習慣電子駕照。

剛才易議員亦發言提及的士、小巴司機證電子化。我們備悉有關建議，亦會考慮相關配套、系統提升。我們持開放態度。

總的來說，今日我聽了不少意見，希望除了踏出今日的重要一步——當然剛才有議員提到是小步，以運輸署和交通運輸管理來說，我認為是一大步，因為使用者多達20多萬（應為200多萬）——我們希望能透過增加使用率、滲透性，可以帶動整個政府在智能管理、電子牌照方面，邁向更快的速度。不少議員剛才提到一證通辦、一站通等，這些其實都是我們的願景。運輸署會就整合駕駛執照及智能身份證的意見與數字政策辦公室（數字辦）跟進。數字辦正全面提升「智方便」平台以推出「個人電子證照」的新功能，讓用戶透過「智方便」流動應用程式展示由不同政府部門發出的電子證照。在電子駕照應用程式推出後，運輸署會繼續與數字辦積極跟進，支援電子駕照應用程式的各項功能。運輸署會繼續保持開放態度，運輸及物流局亦會給予積極的政策支持。若將來電子駕照和數字辦及其他政府部門的證照安排互相配合產生更佳協同效應、做到更便民利民，我們一定會積極考慮和配合。

主席，我懇請議員支持《2025年道路交通（修訂）條例草案》，以推行電子駕照。我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"

立法會：醫務衞生局局長就「全面推展醫療融資改革，善用公私營醫療資源」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-06-12 14:55,2025-06-12 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200507.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（六月十二日）在立法會會議就「全面推展醫療融資改革，善用公私營醫療資源」議員議案的開場發言：

主席：

多謝林哲玄議員提出「全面推展醫療融資改革，善用公私營醫療資源」這項議案，以及梁熙議員、鄧家彪議員、李浩然議員及陳沛良議員提出的修正案，讓我們有機會深入討論醫療融資如何改革。

香港擁有令我們引以為傲的高質高效醫療系統，以簡單低稅制，而無須強制性的醫療保險供款，提供了達97.6%高度資助的公營醫療系統，作為全民覆蓋的安全網，確保市民不會因經濟原因無法獲得適切治療；而私營醫療系統為個別有負擔能力的市民，提供較個性化的選擇。但隨着人口老化、慢病增加、科技進步和人手短缺等引致的供求失衡，香港的醫療系統可持續性已經不單在財政方面，在質量方面也是一個考慮。醫療改革包含醫療服務、醫療藥械，以及醫療融資三方面，必須目標一致、制度配合、政策銜接。國家二十屆三中全會強調堅持深化醫療衞生體系改革，也強調要「三醫」協同發展和治理。

過去本港曾就醫療融資改革進行不少討論。早於上世紀九十年代超過四分之一世紀前，政府已委託顧問全面審視本港醫療制度，這份坊間所稱的「哈佛報告」認為香港繼續採用公共開支作為醫療開支主要支付來源，長遠難以維持。在報告發表後，政府於二○○○年發出《你我齊參與健康伴我行》諮詢文件，就醫療服務架構、質素保證及融資制度等提出改革路向，其中已構思檢討公營醫療收費制度、鼓勵市民自行作醫療投保，並探討引入個人醫療儲蓄戶口的初步槪念。

其後，政府在二○○八至二○一○年展開兩階段醫療改革公眾諮詢，深入探討六個輔助融資方案。在二○○八年《掌握健康掌握人生》第一階段公眾諮詢中，六個方案包括（一）社會醫療保障，即要求有工作的市民繳交某個部分的百分比收入，用作整體人口醫療開支；（二）用者自付費用，即提高公營醫療服務使用者須支付的收費；（三）醫療儲蓄戶口，即強制就業人士按收入比例供款並以投資回報累積，以支付自己的醫療費用；（四）自願私人醫療保險，即透過僱主提供醫療福利，以及個人購買醫療保險應付醫療開支；（五）強制私人醫療保險，即立法強制全民購買醫療保險；及（六）個人健康保險儲備，即同時融合強制醫療儲蓄及保險的計劃。

這六個輔助融資方案各有優劣，而當時社會意見紛紜，支持自願形式的構思普遍較多，而普遍對強制性質的建議有所保留，並且傾向支持風險匯集，多於個人儲蓄的方案，總體而言，市民對自願私人醫療保險的接受程度相對較高。政府因此於二○一○年進行「醫保計劃由我抉擇」第二階段公眾諮詢，集中討論這個建議，並經過與醫療衞生界、保險業界和病人組織等不同持份者磋商後，促成二○一九年推出的自願醫保計劃，提供一種受特定規範，而市場透明度高的個人償款住院保險產品，讓市民更有信心購買醫療保險，以支付醫療服務的費用。

若果大家回顧這段歷程，不難發覺超過四分之一世紀前的諮詢結果及建議內容，現時其實仍然適合，而且可以說，迫在眉睫的程度有過之而無不及，故此我們必須加快落實種種改革。根據過去十年的實際數據反映，不計及2019冠狀病毒病的相關支出，香港醫療衞生總開支佔本地生產總值的百分比從二○一二／一三年度6.1%，升至二○二二／二三年度8.4%；而公共醫療開支佔本地生產總值的百分比更由3.0%增至4.6%。

隨着本港人口急速老化，預期增長趨勢將會加劇。最新數據顯示香港長者（即65歲及以上人口）數目由二○二四年172萬人（佔總人口24%），將增至二○四六年274萬人（佔總人口36%）。根據醫院管理局（醫管局）的實際運作經驗，長者就醫療服務的使用率遠較年青族群為高。目前長者佔香港總人口約兩成四，就診人數佔普通科門診及專科門診超過三分之一，其住院日次和急症室入院人次更佔總人數約一半，故此未來醫療開支只會日益增加，現行高度依靠公帑的融資模式難以長期維持。

通過分析開支細項，可以觀察到香港醫療體系兩個結構性現象。首先是基層醫療相比第二、三層醫療這些醫院及專科服務的開支情況。醫療衞生經常性開支（根據最新二○二二／二三年度本地醫療衞生總開支帳目）達2,263億元，當中基層醫療約623億元，而第二、三層醫療約1,640億元，換言之，基層跟第二、三層的醫療開支比例大致為三比七，反映香港存在「重治療、輕預防」的情況。我們有必要以不同計劃，更好發揮家庭醫生預防、診治和管理慢性疾病的作用，減少或推遲使用費用較高昂的第二、三層醫療服務。

其次是第二、三層醫療的公私營使用分布。根據本地醫療衞生總開支帳目，在住院及日間醫療服務的經常性開支中，公營醫療體系佔比大約為三分之二，卻要應付全港近九成住院日次及日間醫療個案；而私營醫療體系開支佔比達三分之一，卻只處理約一成住院日次及日間醫療個案，這不單反映公營醫療較高的成本效益，亦反映了公私營服務出現失衡。醫療保險中預計約76.6%支出，也是用於第二、三層醫療。在公營醫療壓力日趨沉重的時候，如何更好運用醫療保險，讓「能者共付、自付」，亦是確保香港醫療體系行穩致遠的關鍵。

正如國家主席習近平所說：「健康是人民幸福生活最重要的指標」。本屆特區政府一直致力深化醫療體系改革，確保市民病有良醫。透過推動醫療、醫藥及醫保三者之間的聯動改革，提升香港醫療體系的質素、效率和可持續性。

醫療、醫藥及醫保三醫聯動應用在香港，對應的是我們在醫療服務、醫療藥械及醫療融資三個聯動領域的改革工作。在醫療服務方面，醫務衞生局公布《基層醫療健康藍圖》，積極推進基層醫療發展，加強預防性服務，達致「小病在社區」，並優化公營醫療服務，推動醫管局深化改革，提升醫療質量、安全及效益。

在醫療藥械方面，我們加快創新藥械引入速度，透過「1+」機制達致「好藥港用」，並積極籌備成立香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心，邁向「第一層審批」，以期發展香港成為國際醫療創新樞紐的同時，讓市民能及早受惠於最新科研成果。

就今日的議案辯論，重點討論醫療融資的改革工作，這方面不局限於醫療保險或其他方式支付私營服務，而是指如何保障市民使用醫療服務的財政可持續性。在公營醫療領域，政府於今年三月公布公營醫療收費改革措施，根據「承擔不減」、「能者／輕症共付」、「有加有減」、「高度資助」及「循序漸進」五大原則，加強精準資助，達致三個主要目標：（一）改革資助架構、引導善用服務；（二）減少浪費濫用，提升服務效率；（三）加強保障「貧困、急症、重病、危疾」病人，從而加固全民醫療安全網，強化公營醫療系統的可持續性，改善公私營失衡。

在私營醫療領域，我們剛在五月向衞生事務委員會簡介提高私營醫療服務收費透明度的立法建議，包括規定私營醫療機構按指定格式公布價目資料、提供服務費用預算，以及呈報及公布過往收費數據，同時提出各項長遠優化措施，讓市民在接受醫療服務前，可以掌握充分資訊作出比較，預算所需費用。醫務衞生局正由今個月起陸續會見持份者，就構思詳情進行諮詢。

至於醫療保險領域，最新數據顯示本地醫療衞生經常性開支中，私人支出佔總開支約48%，當中主要來源是住戶實付支出（佔私人支出63.1%）、私人購買的保險計劃（21.4%）和僱主提供的保險計劃（13.2%），保險作為第三方付費的角色日益重要。政府於二○一九年四月全面推行自願醫保計劃至今，保單數目按年增長，雖然受新冠疫情的影響，截至二○二四年年底，自願醫保計劃保單達142.8萬張，估計在全港個人償款住院保險市場的佔比約為三分之一。政府將繼續推廣自願醫保計劃，並與保險業界合作，以期日後可成為市場主流產品，讓病人選用醫療服務時更具保障。

主席，深化醫療體系改革，尤其是醫療融資議題，需要全社會的理解和支持。政府將秉持開放態度，聆聽各界意見。我期待各位議員稍後的發言，並會在總結發言中作出回應。謝謝。"

The first seminar of the series, on the topic of ""Achieving the Rejuvenation of Chinese Culture: Insights from the Ne Zha Craze"", was delivered today (June 12) by the Executive Director of the Academy of Chinese Studies, Dr Yau Yat.

  Addressing the seminar, the Head of the CSC, Mr Oscar Kwok, said that as Mr Zhao Qizheng, former Director of the State Council Information Office, proposed in his book, it is the joint responsibility of every Chinese national to present China to the world. Given the complex and volatile international situation nowadays, the development of a country hinges not only on its own national conditions but also on the international environment, including the international public opinion environment. In the Internet era, deliberate distortions of facts and truths are more likely to be widely disseminated, and misunderstandings and prejudices about China's situation and developments are common among foreigners. As such, every civil servant needs to learn how to present China to the world through cultural soft power.

  Through analysing China's developments and challenges from the cultural, technological, economic and other perspectives, the series enables civil servants to learn about the real stories of the country, so they can better leverage the role of Hong Kong as a bridge between the country and the world to enhance mutual understanding and to promote exchange and co-operation. The first seminar held today on ""Achieving the Rejuvenation of Chinese Culture: Insights from the Ne Zha Craze"" explored how the country showcased the rich heritage of Chinese culture to the world through popular culture, increasing China's attractiveness and further enhancing its voice on the international stage.

  Mr Kwok said he hopes that participants can seize this learning opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of China's mode of development and embrace the mission of people's diplomacy to present an authentic China to the world in their respective roles.

  Around 340 middle and senior-level civil servants from 52 bureaux and departments attended the seminar in person or online today."

公務員學院院長郭蔭庶在講座致辭時指出，前國務院新聞辦公室主任趙啟正在其著作中提出，每個中國人都承擔着向世界說明中國的責任。當今國際形勢複雜多變，一個國家的發展，不單取決於本國國情，也受制於國際環境，包括國際輿論環境。在互聯網時代，被刻意扭曲事實和真相更容易廣泛傳播，外國民眾對中國的情況和發展普遍存在誤解和偏見，所以每位公務員都需要學習如何利用文化軟實力向世界說明中國。

本系列通過文化、科技、經濟等多維角度剖析中國的發展和挑戰，讓公務員認識國家的真實故事，裝備他們更好地發揮香港聯通國家與世界的橋樑角色，增進相互理解和推動交流合作。今日第一講「成就中華文化復興——從哪吒熱說起」，探討國家如何透過普及文化創作，向全球展現深厚的中華文化底蘊，增加中國的吸引力，進一步提升中國在國際舞台的話語權。

郭蔭庶期望學員能把握這學習機會，深入認識中國的發展模式，並肩負起人民外交的使命，在各自工作崗位上向世界展現一個真實的中國。

I first joined this event in 2011 as the Deputy Commissioner for Tourism, and I am so very pleased to see so many old friends, all of you are enthusiastic counterparts and stakeholders from the tourism and related sectors, as well as new friends whom may have joined the sector in the last decade or coming from afar. It is an opportune time that we all gather here in Hong Kong – our vibrant metropolis that truly shines as the capital of mega events. My very warm and heartfelt welcome for everyone.

For nearly four decades, the ITE has built and solidifies its reputation as one of the most prominent travel exhibitions in the region, presenting exciting opportunities for industry players to share, exchange and explore the latest trends and tourism offerings. This year, we are thrilled to have 500 exhibitors from some 60 countries and regions joining us. Walking through the Expo is like embarking on a whirlwind tour of the world under one roof.

The theme of the ITE this year is ""From Recovery to Development"". In line with the theme, please allow me to share some exciting updates on how Hong Kong is bouncing back and moving forward on its tourism journey. With the concerted effort of the Government and industry leaders, we witness a strong resurgence in our tourism sector post-pandemic. In 2024, Hong Kong welcomed about 45 million visitors, representing a year-on-year increase of 31 per cent. The strong rebound underscores the resilience of our tourism industry and Hong Kong's enduring appeal as a world-class travel destination. This year, we are aiming even higher, with 49 million visitors projected, a 10 per cent rise from last year. In the first five months of 2025, we have already welcomed a total of 20 million visitors, registering a 12 per cent increase over last year, putting us on track to achieve our target of a 10 per cent increase for this year.

This impressive recovery is a strong testament to Hong Kong's diverse, innovative and attractive tourism offerings. We are proud to cater to the wide-ranging preferences of our visitors. From world-class attractions and museums, to our iconic harbour, scenic outdoors, exotic islands, gastronomic diversity and excellence, and festive celebrations, Hong Kong promises an experience like no others. These days, a major highlight is our year-round mega events and happenings, which is what sets us apart from other cities. Just last weekend, the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) hosted this year's bigger, better Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races with flying colours. Signature HKTB events like Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival every October, Hong Kong New Year Countdown, and Chinese New Year Celebrations, etc., will definitely be back with new elements and enhanced excitement, so that Hong Kong will feature prominently to draw global attention. For the art and sports lovers among us, internationally renowned events such as Art Basel Hong Kong, Art Central, LIV Golf, ComplexCon making their strong presence in Hong Kong. With the opening of our new Kai Tak Sports Park, Hong Kong's largest-ever state-of-the-art sports infrastructure, in this March, our signature rugby event, Hong Kong Sevens, was staged. Building on that success, we have been hosting a series of mega international and local concerts since April, drawing over 580 000 fans, half of them from outside of Hong Kong. And the momentum continues. Just two days ago, we staged a sold-out Asian Cup qualifying football match (AFC Asian Cup 2027 Qualifiers) of Hong Kong, China vs India in the Kai Tak Stadium, and the atmosphere would make even many European stadiums shy. Our football mania will press on, with Liverpool, AC Milan, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur taking centre stage at Kai Tak Stadium in late July, followed by the eight competition events of our country's 15th National Games to be hosted right here in November.

On the business tourism front, the Government has been sparing no effort in driving the growth of MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, and Exhibitions) tourism. Since resumption of normal travel in February 2023, the Hong Kong Tourism Board has successfully secured or helped secure over 2 400 international MICE events to be held in Hong Kong, expected to bring in 570 000 high-value-added overnight MICE visitors to Hong Kong and generate a total spending of about HK$4.4 billion. Riding on this robust recovery, we will step up our efforts in bringing in even more MICE events, with a view to cementing Hong Kong's status as the region's leading MICE destination.

And we will not stop here, we are working in full steam to strengthen our traditional tourism resources on one hand, and unearth new ones, such as our beautiful islands and country parks where tourists can explore and experience Hong Kong's natural wonders, on the other. Recently, we have announced nine appealing projects to boost tourism, including the Hong Kong Industrial Brand Tourism to showcase the ""made-in-Hong Kong"" industrial tourism through guided tours to the manufactures home, city walks at the neighbourhood of Old Town Central and Kowloon City, the latter is where the hugely popular movie, ""Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In"" based on. These projects are designed to tap into the growing demand for authentic, one-of-a-kind experience, ensuring Hong Kong remains a unique must-visit destination.

Before I close, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all our industry partners for their steadfast support and contribution to our tourism recovery journey. With the collective effort of the Government, our industry and the community in concert, I am confident that we will bring our tourism industry and development to new heights in the years to come.

Once again, please accept my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to join you at the ITE again after all these years. I wish the twin expos another year of resounding success. Thank you."

Alfred (President of the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation, Mr Alfred Leung), Vice President Wang (Vice President of the Research Institute of Highway of the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China Mr Wang Shuiyin), Tony (Director of Highways, Mr Tony Yau), distinguished guests and speakers, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the inaugural International Conference on Roads and Railways - a timely and important gathering that brings together a distinguished community of policymakers, engineers, academics and industry leaders to explore the future of connectivity and sustainable mobility.

  To our guests from the Mainland and overseas, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong.

The future of roads and railways

  Roads and railways have long been the backbone of economic growth and social advancement. They are more than just physical infrastructure; they are public goods that connect people, expand opportunities, foster mutual understanding, and enable more inclusive development.

  In an era of rapid technological advancement and growing climate urgency, we are called not only to build infrastructure, but to build it smarter and greener. Transportation systems must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in ways that align with the sustainable development goals and meet the needs of future generations.

  Around the world, the momentum towards smart and sustainable mobility is accelerating. Emerging technologies, from artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, to automation and digital twin systems, are transforming how we plan and manage transport infrastructure. These innovations are helping us optimise construction engineering, enable real-time traffic management, and apply AI-powered predictive maintenance that cuts costs, reduces downtime and enhances safety.

  In short, we are seeing a profound shift from traditional infrastructure to intelligent assets that adapt, learn and improve over time.

  At the same time, the global push for decarbonisation is reshaping the transport landscape, calling for action on multiple fronts such as using low-carbon materials in construction; designing infrastructure to support green logistics; and investing in EV charging networks as critical enablers of clean transport. It also means leveraging smart technologies, such as optimising energy consumption through AI, sensor-based monitoring, modular construction, and more, to reduce emissions across the life cycle of transport assets.

  Green infrastructure, once a goal, is now a necessity.

  A key strategy in this transition is transit-oriented development, or TOD, which is a planning approach that integrates high-density urban development with efficient public transport systems. It clusters housing, commercial services and amenities around transit hubs, reducing reliance on private vehicles and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

  Studies show that well-executed TOD can reduce urban carbon emissions by up to 25 per cent, while also enhancing liveability, walkability and economic vitality. In essence, TOD is about building communities that are compact, connected and carbon-conscious.

Hong Kong's experience

  So where does Hong Kong stand in all these - and how can we contribute? I believe there are several areas that Hong Kong can share experience with our peers.

  First, technological expertise and professional excellence. Hong Kong's pathway in transport infrastructure is built on advanced engineering know-how, precision planning, and a commitment to innovation. Mable, our Secretary for Transport and Logistics, will soon provide a detailed account of how we are taking the projects forwards and how we are applying advanced technologies. But allow me to highlight a few unique features of our experience.

  Hong Kong is a compact and high-density city, where land is scarce and infrastructure must coexist with tight urban spaces. This has made us a pioneer in TOD, with railways serving as the backbone of urban development. Our railway-led planning integrates transport, housing and commercial uses to create seamlessly connected and lower-emission communities.

  A good example is the Northern Metropolis, envisioned as a major innovation and technology hub. With a projected population of 2.5 million and over 650 000 new jobs, its development will be ""infrastructure-led"" and ""capacity-creating"" - with key projects such as the Northern Metropolis Highway and the Northern Link driving connectivity and growth in the region.

  Given our dense built environment, careful planning and community engagement are essential to avoid undue disruption. While this can be time-consuming, it reminds us of the need to build infrastructure that is responsive to public aspirations and socially inclusive.

  Cross-boundary land transport infrastructure is a defining characteristic of Hong Kong. We have nine land boundary control points. From the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge to the High Speed Rail, we have experience in integrating different engineering standards, operational models and even legal frameworks. A good example is the co-location of Mainland's and Hong Kong's customs, immigration and quarantine facilities at the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station. These projects require a high degree of agility, co-ordination with our counterparts and innovation.

  Second, smart and green innovation. Hong Kong is committed to making our transport systems smarter and greener, both as an innovator of new technologies and a user of cutting-edge solutions.

  On the innovation side, we are investing heavily in four key technology areas: AI and robotics, biotech, fintech, and new energy and materials. Our goal is to become an international innovation and technology hub, with AI at its core.

  We already have a vibrant ecosystem of some 4 700 start-ups. In addition, we have been making good progress in attracting strategic enterprises to establish their presence, including R&D centres, here in Hong Kong. These include companies engaged in EVs, autonomous driving, smart traffic management and green materials, many of which are eager to seek global partners to expand their applications.

  On the application side, our high-density urban environment demands the use of advanced technologies to maintain efficiency and reliability of the transportation system. The opportunities in this space are vast, and we warmly welcome tech innovators from around the world to share solutions, co-create new applications, and shape the future of mobility together.

  Finally, financing the future. Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre gives us a unique and powerful lever to support infrastructure development globally.

  With a full suite of funding options, Hong Kong is where infrastructure projects from around the world can raise funds. This is particularly relevant for green, low-carbon infrastructure projects. We are Asia's leading green bond market, accounting for nearly half of the region's total issuance.

  And we are also pioneering innovative financing models to unlock capital for infrastructure development. One such example is securitisation of infrastructure loans, a mechanism that transforms mature, revenue-generating brownfield assets into investment products, thereby freeing up capital for new greenfield projects. To date, Hong Kong has issued two such tranches, totalling US$800 million, supporting over 50 projects across the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.

  In regions where infrastructure funding gap remains urgent and significant - particularly in the Global South - Hong Kong offers practical and scalable ways to accelerate the delivery of essential and sustainable transport networks.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, I believe the path to smarter and greener mobility is full of potential - and it is through collaboration, innovation and shared commitment that we will realise it.

  On this note, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Highways Department, and the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation for organising this meaningful conference.

  I wish the conference every success, and I look forward to the ideas and partnerships that will emerge from these three exciting days. Thank you very much."

Speech by FS at International Conference on Roads and Railways 2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-06-12 11:26,2025-06-12 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200345.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the International Conference on Roads and Railways 2025 today (June 12):

Alfred (President of the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation, Mr Alfred Leung), Vice President Wang (Vice President of the Research Institute of Highway of the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China Mr Wang Shuiyin), Tony (Director of Highways, Mr Tony Yau), distinguished guests and speakers, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the inaugural International Conference on Roads and Railways - a timely and important gathering that brings together a distinguished community of policymakers, engineers, academics and industry leaders to explore the future of connectivity and sustainable mobility.

  To our guests from the Mainland and overseas, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong.

The future of roads and railways

  Roads and railways have long been the backbone of economic growth and social advancement. They are more than just physical infrastructure; they are public goods that connect people, expand opportunities, foster mutual understanding, and enable more inclusive development.

  In an era of rapid technological advancement and growing climate urgency, we are called not only to build infrastructure, but to build it smarter and greener. Transportation systems must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in ways that align with the sustainable development goals and meet the needs of future generations.

  Around the world, the momentum towards smart and sustainable mobility is accelerating. Emerging technologies, from artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, to automation and digital twin systems, are transforming how we plan and manage transport infrastructure. These innovations are helping us optimise construction engineering, enable real-time traffic management, and apply AI-powered predictive maintenance that cuts costs, reduces downtime and enhances safety.

  In short, we are seeing a profound shift from traditional infrastructure to intelligent assets that adapt, learn and improve over time.

  At the same time, the global push for decarbonisation is reshaping the transport landscape, calling for action on multiple fronts such as using low-carbon materials in construction; designing infrastructure to support green logistics; and investing in EV charging networks as critical enablers of clean transport. It also means leveraging smart technologies, such as optimising energy consumption through AI, sensor-based monitoring, modular construction, and more, to reduce emissions across the life cycle of transport assets.

  Green infrastructure, once a goal, is now a necessity.

  A key strategy in this transition is transit-oriented development, or TOD, which is a planning approach that integrates high-density urban development with efficient public transport systems. It clusters housing, commercial services and amenities around transit hubs, reducing reliance on private vehicles and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

  Studies show that well-executed TOD can reduce urban carbon emissions by up to 25 per cent, while also enhancing liveability, walkability and economic vitality. In essence, TOD is about building communities that are compact, connected and carbon-conscious.

Hong Kong's experience

  So where does Hong Kong stand in all these - and how can we contribute? I believe there are several areas that Hong Kong can share experience with our peers.

  First, technological expertise and professional excellence. Hong Kong's pathway in transport infrastructure is built on advanced engineering know-how, precision planning, and a commitment to innovation. Mable, our Secretary for Transport and Logistics, will soon provide a detailed account of how we are taking the projects forwards and how we are applying advanced technologies. But allow me to highlight a few unique features of our experience.

  Hong Kong is a compact and high-density city, where land is scarce and infrastructure must coexist with tight urban spaces. This has made us a pioneer in TOD, with railways serving as the backbone of urban development. Our railway-led planning integrates transport, housing and commercial uses to create seamlessly connected and lower-emission communities.

  A good example is the Northern Metropolis, envisioned as a major innovation and technology hub. With a projected population of 2.5 million and over 650 000 new jobs, its development will be ""infrastructure-led"" and ""capacity-creating"" - with key projects such as the Northern Metropolis Highway and the Northern Link driving connectivity and growth in the region.

  Given our dense built environment, careful planning and community engagement are essential to avoid undue disruption. While this can be time-consuming, it reminds us of the need to build infrastructure that is responsive to public aspirations and socially inclusive.

  Cross-boundary land transport infrastructure is a defining characteristic of Hong Kong. We have nine land boundary control points. From the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge to the High Speed Rail, we have experience in integrating different engineering standards, operational models and even legal frameworks. A good example is the co-location of Mainland's and Hong Kong's customs, immigration and quarantine facilities at the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station. These projects require a high degree of agility, co-ordination with our counterparts and innovation.

  Second, smart and green innovation. Hong Kong is committed to making our transport systems smarter and greener, both as an innovator of new technologies and a user of cutting-edge solutions.

  On the innovation side, we are investing heavily in four key technology areas: AI and robotics, biotech, fintech, and new energy and materials. Our goal is to become an international innovation and technology hub, with AI at its core.

  We already have a vibrant ecosystem of some 4 700 start-ups. In addition, we have been making good progress in attracting strategic enterprises to establish their presence, including R&D centres, here in Hong Kong. These include companies engaged in EVs, autonomous driving, smart traffic management and green materials, many of which are eager to seek global partners to expand their applications.

  On the application side, our high-density urban environment demands the use of advanced technologies to maintain efficiency and reliability of the transportation system. The opportunities in this space are vast, and we warmly welcome tech innovators from around the world to share solutions, co-create new applications, and shape the future of mobility together.

  Finally, financing the future. Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre gives us a unique and powerful lever to support infrastructure development globally.

  With a full suite of funding options, Hong Kong is where infrastructure projects from around the world can raise funds. This is particularly relevant for green, low-carbon infrastructure projects. We are Asia's leading green bond market, accounting for nearly half of the region's total issuance.

  And we are also pioneering innovative financing models to unlock capital for infrastructure development. One such example is securitisation of infrastructure loans, a mechanism that transforms mature, revenue-generating brownfield assets into investment products, thereby freeing up capital for new greenfield projects. To date, Hong Kong has issued two such tranches, totalling US$800 million, supporting over 50 projects across the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.

  In regions where infrastructure funding gap remains urgent and significant - particularly in the Global South - Hong Kong offers practical and scalable ways to accelerate the delivery of essential and sustainable transport networks.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, I believe the path to smarter and greener mobility is full of potential - and it is through collaboration, innovation and shared commitment that we will realise it.

  On this note, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Highways Department, and the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation for organising this meaningful conference.

  I wish the conference every success, and I look forward to the ideas and partnerships that will emerge from these three exciting days. Thank you very much."

林定國司長（律政司司長）、區志光秘書長（香港特別行政區維護國家安全委員會秘書長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家早上好。今日我很高興和大家一起參與《香港國安法》公布實施五周年專題展覽的開幕典禮，回顧特區政府如何在中央支持下，一步一步構建維護國安的屏障。

發展和安全是「車之兩輪、鳥之兩翼」。維護國家主權、安全和發展利益不單是香港特區的憲制責任，亦是每一個香港市民的應有之義。

我時常提醒大家不要忘記，過去一段長時間，香港在國家安全方面「不設防」，讓外部勢力有機可乘。從二○一二年的「反國教」，到二○一四年的非法「佔中」、二○一六年的「旺角暴動」、二○一九年的「黑暴」和港版「顏色革命」，境外勢力不斷煽風點火，甚至提供資源，破壞社會安寧，嚴重威脅特區政府的管治，市民苦不堪言。面對如此嚴峻的局面，中央果斷出手，《香港國安法》於二○二○年六月三十日在香港頒布實施，填補了香港特區在維護國安法律制度和執行機制方面的短板。

不過，我們必須緊記，之前亂象是香港歷史上永遠抹不去的傷疤。敵對勢力仍然死心不息，不斷尋找機會危害我們國家和特區的安全。我們要時刻警惕的風險包括：

（一）外部敵對勢力仍通過抹黑和所謂的「制裁」妄圖危害我們的國家安全；
（二）潛逃海外的反中亂港分子，繼續從事危害國家安全的活動和行為，包括繼續宣揚港獨；
（三）本土恐怖主義；以及
（四）軟對抗，一些別有用心的人利用假新聞、假消息不停去分化社會和煽動仇恨。

因此，我們不能夠鬆懈麻痺，自《香港國安法》生效以來，特區政府做了大量工作，包括加強執法力度。截至二○二五年六月一日，所有相關法律下涉及危害國安的案件中，共326人被捕；其中165人已被定罪。國家安全得來不易，特區政府會繼續用好法律，緊守維護國家安全的重責。

更重要的是，我們需要全體市民支持。當每一個市民都慎思明辨，共同努力就能築牢國家安全的屏障。只要每位香港市民多行一步，例如一旦發現可能危害國安的情況，就向警務處國安處熱線舉報，電話是6271 7171。截至今年六月一日，得到市民配合下，已收到超過92萬條相關信息，效果令人鼓舞。

今日的專題展覽是一個很好的平台，讓市民了解《香港國安法》的原則、保障、實施情況和必要性，了解其如何更好保障市民的權利和自由，令我們有更充足的底氣，在安全的環境下推動高質量發展。

最後，我謹祝展覽圓滿成功，亦祝在座各位身體健康。多謝大家。"

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早晨。我十分高興出席《香港國安法》公布實施五周年專題展覽開幕典禮。我希望藉今天機會，重申我之前提及過的三個「不能」和一個「堅持」。

第一個「不能」是不能忘記歷史——中國人的傳統教訓是「前事不忘，後事之師」。我們大家都必然記得二○一九年爆發的「修例風波」，不但國家安全受到嚴重威脅，我們誤以為是理所當然的和平安定社會環境受到巨大破壞，大家不能夠正常學習、工作和生活。我們都感受到切膚之痛，亦令我們深刻認識沒有國家安全，大家都無法真正行使我們都十分珍惜的權利和自由，人身安全、財產也會受到威脅，亦無法過正常生活。我們要謹記這個慘痛的教訓，時刻提醒自己絕對不可以讓歷史重演。

第二個「不能」是不能無視現實——中國人的傳統智慧是居安思危，不可對問題視而不見、聽而不聞。雖然香港社會已回復安定，而國安風險亦往往非肉眼能容易所見，但事實擺在眼前，敵對國家和勢力正企圖不斷打壓我們國家的發展。正正因為香港在「一國兩制」下，在國家發展中扮演着獨特及不可取代的地位，亦是現時國家內最自由開放的地方，自然成為攻擊的目標。某國家企圖通過非法制裁手段和威脅干擾國安案件的正當司法程序、對香港這個零關稅的獨立關稅區實施非法關稅，就是最鮮明的例子。

第三個「不能」是不能袖手旁觀——中國人講究的是凡事要身體力行，不可光說不做。既然國家安全與我們個人福祉息息相關，那麼自然地，我們亦應肩負相應維護國家安全的責任。《香港國安法》第六條清楚指明，維護國家主權、統一和領土完整是包括香港同胞在內的全中國人民的共同義務；在香港的任何機構、組織和個人都應當遵守《香港國安法》和有關維護國家安全的其他法律，不得從事危害國家安全的行為和活動。

在以上三個「不能」的大前提下，我們必須有一個「堅持」，就是堅持按照法治原則維護國家安全。這原則是《香港國安法》第五條明文所規定。優良法治當然是香港賴以成功的基石，是香港能成為國際金融、貿易、航運中心的先決條件。堅持按法治原則維護國家安全，對確保和促進安全和發展這對關係的良性互動至為關鍵。

我非常高興看到這次專題展覽以現代創新生動方式，不偏不倚、深入淺出，向參觀者展示維護國家安全的重要性、香港特區的憲制責任、「修例風波」的歷史真相、中央制定《香港國安法》，以及維護國家安全法律發揮的作用和成效等。我期望通過這次專題展覽，讓大家更了解及明白為何我提出的三個「不能」和一個「堅持」。

尊敬的高翔院長（中國社會科學院、中國歷史研究院院長）、王松苗秘書長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室秘書長）、王祥明董事長（華潤集團董事長）、許正中董事長（紫荊文化集團董事長）、黃平院長（香港中國學術研究院院長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好。今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年。我首先歡迎中國社會科學院、中國歷史研究院高翔院長率團來到香港，也感謝主辦機構籌備這次研討會，讓我們一同銘記歷史、緬懷先烈。珍愛和平，開創未來。

中國人民在抗日戰爭勝利，是民族愛國精神的偉大勝利。在長達14年的艱苦抗戰中，我們的先烈砥礪奮鬥，以強大的民族意識和愛國精神，激勵並推動着全國人民義無反顧地團結抵抗外敵，保衞家國。

今天的研討會在香港舉辦，意義重大，除了引領香港市民紀念這段可歌可泣的歷史，更提醒我們香港在抗日戰爭和反法西斯戰爭中的重要角色。

香港作為自由港已有接近兩百年歷史，更一直擔當獨一無二的中外交通樞紐。在抗戰時，香港眾志成城，成為向祖國和盟軍運送物資的重要渠道和交通動脈，積極投身抗戰前線，守護國家。

當時香港的民眾和僑胞聚沙成塔，在物資上全力支援祖國抗日，很多更投身民間抗日組織，例如家傳戶曉的東江縱隊和港九大隊等。這些由平民組成的游擊隊，雖然軍備不足、資源有限，但每位隊員都奮勇抗敵，除了保護平民和海上航道，更多次營救受困的文化人士、盟軍成員等，縱然在香港淪陷後，依然堅持進行反攻作戰，在抗戰期間展現堅毅不屈的家國情操。

香港市民與祖國同胞血濃於水，在國難之時，更是團結一致，奮力抗敵，保家衞國。經過了艱苦卓絕的鬥爭，中國人民在抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭中取得了偉大勝利，開闢了中華民族偉大復興的光明前景。

抗戰勝利距今已經80年，我們之中的大部分人沒有親身經歷戰爭的洗禮，成長於國家發展蒸蒸日上、走向更強盛的年代，但我們和下一代必須銘記先烈為中華民族以至世界和平的犧牲和不屈不撓的精神，時刻牢記今天國家和諧穩定、繁榮昌盛的得來不易，高度警惕任何美化侵略主義和分裂國家的思想言論。

為了紀念抗戰勝利80周年，香港將舉辦一連串的活動，提升全社會的愛國精神。「愛國主義教育工作小組」正統籌特區政府各相關政策局及部門開展籌備工作，包括官方紀念儀式、多個大型主題展覽、抗戰電影放映會、優化具抗戰歷史意義的旅遊配套等形式的多樣活動。

行政長官出席紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年國際學術研討會致辭（只有中文）,2025-06-12 10:11,2025-06-12 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200283.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（六月十二日）出席紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年國際學術研討會的致辭：

尊敬的高翔院長（中國社會科學院、中國歷史研究院院長）、王松苗秘書長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室秘書長）、王祥明董事長（華潤集團董事長）、許正中董事長（紫荊文化集團董事長）、黃平院長（香港中國學術研究院院長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好。今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年。我首先歡迎中國社會科學院、中國歷史研究院高翔院長率團來到香港，也感謝主辦機構籌備這次研討會，讓我們一同銘記歷史、緬懷先烈。珍愛和平，開創未來。

中國人民在抗日戰爭勝利，是民族愛國精神的偉大勝利。在長達14年的艱苦抗戰中，我們的先烈砥礪奮鬥，以強大的民族意識和愛國精神，激勵並推動着全國人民義無反顧地團結抵抗外敵，保衞家國。

今天的研討會在香港舉辦，意義重大，除了引領香港市民紀念這段可歌可泣的歷史，更提醒我們香港在抗日戰爭和反法西斯戰爭中的重要角色。

香港作為自由港已有接近兩百年歷史，更一直擔當獨一無二的中外交通樞紐。在抗戰時，香港眾志成城，成為向祖國和盟軍運送物資的重要渠道和交通動脈，積極投身抗戰前線，守護國家。

當時香港的民眾和僑胞聚沙成塔，在物資上全力支援祖國抗日，很多更投身民間抗日組織，例如家傳戶曉的東江縱隊和港九大隊等。這些由平民組成的游擊隊，雖然軍備不足、資源有限，但每位隊員都奮勇抗敵，除了保護平民和海上航道，更多次營救受困的文化人士、盟軍成員等，縱然在香港淪陷後，依然堅持進行反攻作戰，在抗戰期間展現堅毅不屈的家國情操。

香港市民與祖國同胞血濃於水，在國難之時，更是團結一致，奮力抗敵，保家衞國。經過了艱苦卓絕的鬥爭，中國人民在抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭中取得了偉大勝利，開闢了中華民族偉大復興的光明前景。

抗戰勝利距今已經80年，我們之中的大部分人沒有親身經歷戰爭的洗禮，成長於國家發展蒸蒸日上、走向更強盛的年代，但我們和下一代必須銘記先烈為中華民族以至世界和平的犧牲和不屈不撓的精神，時刻牢記今天國家和諧穩定、繁榮昌盛的得來不易，高度警惕任何美化侵略主義和分裂國家的思想言論。

為了紀念抗戰勝利80周年，香港將舉辦一連串的活動，提升全社會的愛國精神。「愛國主義教育工作小組」正統籌特區政府各相關政策局及部門開展籌備工作，包括官方紀念儀式、多個大型主題展覽、抗戰電影放映會、優化具抗戰歷史意義的旅遊配套等形式的多樣活動。

特區政府一直在社會建立以愛國愛港為核心、同「一國兩制」方針相適應的主流價值觀，推動社會各界和愛國愛港團體，積極組織不同的紀念活動，豐富市民的愛國主義教育體驗，進一步強化青年對國家的歸屬感。

DSD implements flood prevention measures to cope with Tropical Storm Wutip (with photos),2025-06-12 00:15,2025-06-12 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061101095.htm,"âIn light of the approaching Tropical Storm Wutip, the Director of Drainage Services, Mr Ringo Mok, held a meeting on June 11 with the senior management team of the department, followed by inspections of locations that had been hit by severe flooding in the past, such as Chai Wan, Heng Fa Chuen, and Wong Tai Sin, to learn about the implementation of flood prevention measures.

Mr Mok and the senior management team inspected several locations respectively, including the modular pumping system at Chai Wan Road roundabout, the installation of demountable flood barriers at Heng Fa Chuen, the divider holds at Lung Cheung Road carriageway in Wong Tai Sin, manhole covers, and the Pilot Scheme on Wading Line System. He also inspected the powerful pumping robots, Mobile Powerful Pumping Robot and Amphibious Pumping Robot, to ensure their readiness for operation.

As the Tropical Storm Wutip came within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong, the Drainage Services Department (DSD) initiated early preparation for low-lying or exposed coastal areas, such as Tai O and Lei Yue Mun. The measures include inspecting drainage channels, installing demountable flood barriers, setting up temporary water pumps, providing and placing sandbags, and constructing temporary pedestrian walkways. The DSD will maintain close liaison with the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and closely monitor the flooding situation.

Earlier in March this year, the DSD conducted a drill in full spectrum before the rainy season and further enhanced the response capacity of the Emergency Control Centre (ECC). During extreme weather, the number of emergency response teams will increase from 160 last year to approximately 180, with over 30 emergency operation stations in Hong Kong, to conduct inspections and clearance of drainage channels across the territory. The DSD will continue to implement the ""just-in-time clearance"" measures, deploying staff immediately upon receiving rainstorm warnings from the HKO to inspect and clear 240 drainage points in Hong Kong which are prone to blockages.

When the HKO issues a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, a special announcement on Flooding in the northern New Territories, the Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement or Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or above, the DSD's ECC will come into operation immediately to handle and coordinate emergency flooding incidents in Hong Kong.

The DSD reminds members of the public to complete precautionary measures for coping with typhoon and flooding as soon as possible, keep the drains clear at all times and avoid blockage of drainage intakes. In the event of serious flooding, they should evacuate immediately. The DSD urges the public to immediately call the 24-hour Drainage Hotline at 2300 1110 in case of flooding."

主席：

我現在提出政府的修正案，修正《2025年房屋（修訂）條例草案》的詳題、第5（1）條、第8條及第14條。有關修正案充分考慮及反映了法案委員會的建議，並且獲得法案委員會的支持。修正案的內容已載於分發給各位委員的檔案。

就《條例草案》的詳題，因應法案委員會的意見，我們對行文作出輕微的修訂，令詳題更清晰、簡潔。

就第5（1）條的修訂，因應有議員的意見，我們在第25（3A）條中列明第25（4）條只適用於根據《房屋條例》第16（1）條出租作住宅用途的土地的租戶，以加強有關條文的清晰度。

就第8條的修訂，在法案委員會上，有議員建議我們參考《稅務條例》（第112章）的用字，以「經營 （carrying on）」取代「為了…目的（for purposes relating to）」。因應議員的意見，我們對相應的條文作出修訂。如租戶在租住單位經營任何貿易或業務，或容許其他人在租住單位內經營任何貿易或業務，而該租戶或其家庭的已登記戶籍的家庭成員又不居住於有關單位，即屬違法。

最後，就第14條的修訂，為理順繳付定額罰款通知書及繳款通知書的程序，我們以《2024年電子執行交通法例（雜項修訂）條例》（2024年第13號條例）為藍本，對《條例草案》的有關條文作出修訂。經修訂後，繳交罰款的人除可交付通知書外，亦可提供通知書上載列的通知書編號或電子繳款號碼，並根據定額罰款通知書或繳款通知書上的繳款指示繳交罰款。

法案委員會對上述修正案並無異議。我請各位委員支持有關修正案。多謝主席。"

主席：

首先我想衷心感謝《2025年房屋（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）的委員會主席陳健波議員、副主席洪雯議員、其他委員及立法會秘書處人員的努力，令《條例草案》的審議工作能夠順利完成，並於今日恢復二讀辯論。我亦感謝剛才發言的多位議員支持《條例草案》，加強阻嚇力，讓我們珍貴的公屋資源可以好好地利用，亦提出很多寶貴意見，讓我們日後執行時可以留意，特別在情理兼備上給了很多例子，去小心處理；亦提議我們日後執法時，是否繼續加強和其他部門的協作、與內地機構單位取得一些有用的資料，以及利用資訊科技等去做好一些偵測的工作。

社會已經形成強烈共識，剛才很多議員發言，都有這個看法。公共房屋資源很珍貴，必須好好利用，交予有需要的市民手上。畢竟今天，仍然有很多市民在劏房等惡劣的環境，需要公屋。今屆政府上任以來通過一系列加強打擊濫用公共租住房屋的措施，成績大家都看得到，獲得社會各界的肯定。香港房屋委員會（房委會）由今屆政府開始，即二○二二年七月開始，至（今年）三月底，收回約8 200個被濫用或違反租約的公屋單位，有議員都類比，等於一個何文田邨般大的屋邨，替政府節省的資源是八十二億元或以上，因為還有很多的道路和配套設施等，所以這項工作很重要，亦必須繼續做。

正如我在動議二讀時指出，《條例草案》的主要目標是使打擊濫用公共房屋的措施更具阻嚇力，從而令居民及相關人士不會以身試法。但我強調，正常在公屋居住、正常使用或者鄰里間的一些很溫情的、常情常理的表現、互相幫助，或者剛才有議員說，其實今天的公屋（居民），仍有互相借雞蛋、豉油等行為，這些溫情的行為，或是間中幫助鄰家的長者，或者幫助鄰家的小孩補習等，而不是利用公屋進行商業、貿易行為。或者在現今社會，有很多新的工作模式：在家工作，或者在網上處理事項等，但他不是在公屋單位內交收，公屋不會變成貨倉，或者不會變成很多陌生人經常出入公屋取貨、付款等，這些不是嚴重濫用公屋的行為。我們針對的是一些自己本身不在單位居住，但卻用來作牟利的行為，這些就是我們這次《條例草案》要去打擊的。

亦有議員說，我們處理一些濫用或者違反公屋租約時，我們有一個上訴機制，是否上訴機制好像沒有成功個案？不是的，其實我們看一些數字，上訴機制是有效，上訴成功（率）維持在百分之二十至三十。有一些是修訂原先的建議，大概也有百分之二十至三十，證明上訴機制是運作良好，我們都會看一些客觀數據。

我們的濫用公屋獎（「舉報濫用公屋獎」），正正就是有一些左鄰右里，騷擾一些良好的公屋居民。我聽過有婆婆說，鄰家經常有些很兇惡的人出入，她很害怕，如果願意舉報，其實是保護一些需要幫助的鄰居。

除了把嚴重濫用公屋變成罪行、賦權獲授權人員在指定情況下要求相關人士提供個人資料外，《條例草案》亦建議延長虛假陳述、拒絕提供資料及非法讓與罪行的檢控時效。《條例草案》的內容與社會意見是一致的，同時亦反映今屆政府的決心、魄力，從根本解決這個大家都覺得一定要大力處理的問題。過去如果一些虛假陳述的個案，事實上刑罰也是重的，有些個案是監禁了30天，或者兩星期，所以真的要大家市民留意，不要違反這些條例。

此外，就《房屋（交通違例事項）（定額罰款）附例》（《第283C章》）的技術性修訂亦讓我們在打擊屋邨範圍內非法使用道路方面更能靈活變通。

總體而言，法案委員會委員均支持《條例草案》，並認同應盡快完成法例的修訂工作。就《條例草案》的草擬，委員亦提出了很多具建設性的建議。經審慎考慮，我們採納委員的部分建議，並提出相關修正條文。我會稍後在全體委員會審議階段提出修正案時再作介紹。

立法時間表方面，《第283C章》的技術性修訂將於法例刊憲當日起實施。就《條例草案》的其他內容（即把嚴重濫用公屋變成罪行、賦權獲授權人員在執行職務時，可要求侵入者或可疑人士提供個人資料及延長虛假陳述、拒絕提供資料及非法讓與罪行的檢控時效）將於明年三月三十一日起實施。《條例草案》分兩個階段實施，讓我們有充足的時間向前線人員提供足夠的指引及培訓，以確保運作暢順，並進行廣泛的公眾教育，以釋除擔心有人會誤墮法網等的疑慮。

如獲立法會三讀通過《條例草案》，正如我上述所言，我們會加大力度宣傳，包括派發宣傳單張到租戶的信箱、在屋邨大堂張貼海報、製作一些簡單易明的懶人包、宣傳短片，亦很多謝剛才有議員提議我們拍一些處境短劇，這些都令市民很容易吸收明白，電子海報或是一些文字訊息，以及透過房委會和房屋署網站、巴士、鐵路廣告等，將訊息廣泛地傳遞給公眾及公屋租戶。

我們亦都明白要加強我們前線人員的培訓，剛才有議員發言提及有些個案講及我們前線人員，對一些申請公屋的朋友，有點不禮貌的對待。我聽到其實很心痛，亦請相關的議員在會後可以將有關的詳細資料交給我，我們一定會嚴肅地跟進處理。這些個案亦提醒了我們，其實房委會每一位同事都很重要，都是市民對我們很深刻的印象，所以每一個同事都必須要抱着關懷、耐心和專業的態度，去對待每一名他們接觸到的市民。我們亦希望跟社會的持份者保持溝通。

剛才的討論亦有提及房屋階梯，見到我們打濫有成效，階梯亦有一個流動性，往後我們都會努力地繼續研究，去完善我們的房屋階梯。大家亦有提及上進、上流，這都是房屋局、房屋署全體心中的一個目標，我希望在下一個階段更多跟大家探討，希望大家一起出謀獻策，令到我們這個階梯活起來。

剛才有議員說其實公屋居民住了一段時間，都很想買居屋。以往出現的情況，可能大家都記得，二○○四年開始有十年是沒有居屋銷售。現在的情況很不同，由現在開始，未來五年，房委會共有四萬五千個居屋單位推出，加上房協（香港房屋協會）可能再有多一萬個。所以居屋絕對是上進、上流的一個選擇，將來社會討論多點，令公屋居民或年輕家庭，以資助出售房屋的置業為一個起步點，我想大家可以一起多點探討和談論。

最後，我懇請議員支持通過《條例草案》。多謝主席，我謹此陳辭。"
HKSAR Government opposes slanderous remarks by foreign countries and anti-China organisations on case of Joshua Wong Chi-fung,2025-06-11 21:51,2025-06-11 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061101007.htm,"âThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (June 11) strongly condemned and opposed some Western countries, anti-China organisations and anti-China politicians, etc., for making erroneous slanders and smears on the case of Joshua Wong Chi-fung involving the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the HKSAR's work on safeguarding national security, totally disregarding the spirit of the rule of law.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""As the legal proceedings of the case involving Joshua Wong Chi-fung are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the case. The HKSAR Government strongly urges these Western countries, anti-China organisations and anti-China politicians to immediately stop interfering in the HKSAR's internal affairs and the independent exercise of judicial power by the courts of the HKSAR.

""The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation. The Department of Justice of the HKSAR is in charge of criminal prosecutions under Article 63 of the Basic Law, with all its prosecutorial decisions made on an objective analysis of all admissible evidence and applicable laws.

""The Judiciary of the HKSAR exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence will receive fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong (including the HKNSL) and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or backgrounds of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.

""Any attempt by any country, organisation, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power, thereby resulting in a defendant not being able to have a fair trial that one should receive, is a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR and should be condemned.

""We are appalled by irresponsible remarks of some countries, organisations or individuals that seemed to suggest that people with certain political beliefs should be immune to legal sanctions, or even call for release of suspects who have been arrested by the HKSAR law enforcement agencies in accordance with the law.

""The HKSAR Government will, as always, resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the HKNSL, the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, whilst upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'."""

The fresh provision shop is located at Shop A, G/F 888 Canton Road, Kowloon. The water sample was taken from a fish tank inside the shop on June 5. The test result obtained evening today confirmed the presence of Vibrio cholera O1, hence the FEHD took immediate follow-up actions.

To protect public health, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene ordered the immediate closure of the fresh provision shop under the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance.

The fresh provision shop will remain closed for thorough cleansing and disinfection of the premises and fish tanks until the Director is satisfied with its overall hygiene condition and believes that there is no immediate health hazard.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""Vibrio cholerae cannot survive under high temperature and can be killed by thorough cooking.""

âThe spokesman urged members of the public to pay attention to personal and food hygiene, and observe the following guidelines to prevent cholera.

* Wash and scrub shellfish thoroughly;
* Clean the seafood and remove the internal organs, and cook thoroughly before consumption;

大家晚上好。很高興出席今天的交流晚宴。今晚，我們相聚在香港這座充滿活力與創意的城市，共同迎接明天開幕的2025國際汽車及供應鏈博覽會。首先，我感謝主辦機構組織這個盛會，也向各位嘉賓，特別是從各地到來的朋友們表示最熱烈的歡迎！

今次的博覽會不僅是一場汽車行業的盛會，更是首次在香港舉辦，象徵國家汽車產業升級與香港深度結合的新機遇。事實上，全球對新能源汽車的需求不斷上升，根據國際能源署的資料，去年全球電動汽車銷量超過1700萬輛，預計今年將突破2000萬輛，佔新車總銷量超過四分之一。

我國是新能源汽車的領航者，也是出口大國，從電池製造到系統整合，從自動駕駛到乘坐體驗，多個品牌都在國際上引領潮流，可以說是亮點紛呈。今年首4個月，中國新能源汽車出口超過64萬輛，同比增長53%，出口市場覆蓋全球超過170個國家及地區，成績斐然。

香港作為聯通內地與國際的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，一直以來都是內地企業走向國際市場的重要門戶。在「一國兩制」的獨特優勢下，我們絕對有條件成為中國車企及產業鏈出海的「落腳點、橋頭堡、充電站、推進器」。其中有兩點香港的貢獻尤其獨特。

第一，是以金融支持內地新汽車工業的全球佈局。汽車工業涉及的上、中、下游企業數以千計，它們需要資金持續推動科研、創新和發展。香港擁有蓬勃和全鏈條的籌融資市場和高質量的金融服務，從天使基金、風投創投到私募資金以及上市證券市場，都能連接全球的資金和投資者，為不同範疇的企業提供所需的金融支持。上月寧德時代在香港上市，成為了今年以來全球最大的IPO（首次公開招股），它所籌得的資金約九成用於匈牙利廠房的建設，是「香港集資以支持國際拓展」這模式的示範。無懼當前的地緣政治環境，國際投資者對中國創科企業的興趣和憧憬，讓更多國際資金來到香港，尋求投資項目。我相信跟汽車產業鏈和供應鏈相關的企業，能更容易找到好的投資者。此外，香港在「一國兩制」下「內聯外通」的獨特優勢，對國際法規和習慣的熟悉，以及遍佈全球的網絡，能夠助力內地企業出海、走進國際市場。我鼓勵大家在香港設立國際業務總部、供應鏈管理中心和財資中心等。

第二，香港正全力推動創科發展成為香港經濟的新引擎，並與粵港澳大灣區的兄弟城市聯動，成為涵蓋研發、商業化到先進製造等功能全面的國際創科中心。其中，香港標準與國際高度接軌、保障知識產權制度完善、匯聚內地和國際數據和人才等優點，都讓新能源汽車、智慧交通、車聯網等產業有更廣闊的試驗空間和應用場景。事實上，多家在這領域的企業已經落戶香港，並成為我們重要的合作夥伴。不少它們上下游的企業也已到了香港，成立研發和人才培訓基地。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，汽車產業的未來發展離不開全球化的視野和資源整合。儘管當前全球面對保護主義和關稅戰，但國際間持續推動綠色轉型，加上新興市場的快速擴張，以及我國新能源汽車的競爭力，我相信整個產業正在迎來新的發展藍海。我們熱烈歡迎各位善用香港的優勢，一起共建汽車產業出海與全球合作的新高地，為全球的綠水青山、為各地人民更美好的生活作出更大的貢獻！

最後，我祝大家有個愉快的晚上，並祝願本次博覽會圓滿成功、成果豐碩，各位嘉賓朋友身體健康、事業宏達。謝謝大家。"
LCQ21: Safeguarding mental health of academic staff members and students,2025-06-11 18:56,2025-06-11 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100304.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lillian Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

  The mental health of academic staff members and students in Hong Kong draws societal concern. There are views that the Government should strengthen the protection of their physical and mental health as well as to provide appropriate support services to the families of suicide victims concerned. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of academic staff members and students committing suicide and attempting to commit suicide in each of the past five years and, among them, the numbers of cases in which death inquests were held, together with a breakdown by types of school (i.e. (i) primary school, (ii) secondary school and (iii) university);

(2) of the Government's follow-up and support procedures in respect of cases of suicide attempts among academic staff members and students, including the policy bureaux involved, the category of professionals providing support services in those cases and the areas and extent of intervention, as well as details of the support services provided by them; and

(3) in respect of the suicide cases mentioned in (1), whether the Government has provided support services (e.g. professional emotional counselling services) to the families, relatives and friends of the suicide victims; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; primarily which government departments' staff members to provide assistance to the families of suicide victims and inform them of their rights under the law (including the rights of the families to request for holding a death inquest)?

Reply:

President,

  The Education Bureau (EDB) attaches great importance to the mental health of teachers and students, and has all along been encouraging schools to adopt the Whole School Approach. Through cross-departmental, cross-disciplinary and cross-sector collaboration, the EDB enhances the mental health of teachers and students and provides enhanced support for students with mental health needs (including those with suicidal risk) via various measures and activities directed at three levels, namely Universal, Selective and Indicated. In recent years, the EDB has implemented a number of measures to support students' mental health. This includes implementing the ""4Rs Mental Health Charter"" in the 2024/25 school year, with a view to helping students develop healthy living habits and positive interpersonal relationships, and enhancing their resilience. In addition, starting from the 2023/24 school year, the EDB has launched the Mental Health Literacy Resource Packages suitable for students at different learning stages. In consultation with the Social Welfare Department (SWD), our reply to the question raised by the Hon Lillian Kwok is as follows:

(1) and (2) The EDB has all along required primary and secondary schools to report fatal suspected student suicide cases. The numbers of relevant cases in primary and secondary schools in the past five years (2020 to 2024) are tabulated as follows. Of the cases reported, secondary students accounted for about 91 per cent of the total cases, while primary students accounted for about 9 per cent.

Number of cases


2020

  The EDB does not collect data on fatal suspected suicide cases of school personnel, attempted suicides of students, relevant cases of university students and number of death inquests held.

  We continue to strengthen the identification of and support for students with mental health risks. For example, the EDB organises about 40 additional thematic teacher training workshops in the 2024/25 school year to introduce the practical skills, counselling techniques and intervention strategies in supporting students with mental health needs, as well as organises parent education talk series for parents of primary and secondary school students that cover topics related to the mental health of children.

  Regarding support measures, if schools suspect the students having suicidal risk, schools will arrange school guidance personnel (for example, student guidance teacher/student guidance personnel or school social worker) for early support. If necessary, schools will solicit professional support from the school-based educational psychologists, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, medical, or police officers to ensure that appropriate intervention measures will be taken. To enhance cross-sector collaboration, starting from December 2023, the Government has implemented the Three-tier School-based Emergency Mechanism in all secondary schools in Hong Kong by pooling together the schools' multi-disciplinary teams, the off-campus support network and medical services. The implementation of the Mechanism has been extended till the end of 2025 and related arrangements were enhanced.

  Furthermore, the Government established a cross-departmental referral and collaboration mechanism in April 2024. For instance, when police officers handle attempted suicide cases concerning primary and secondary students that happen outside schools, the Police will, upon obtaining the consent from the student concerned and the parent/guardian, refer the case to the school the student is attending, via the EDB, for support services. If the student and parent/guardian wish to receive support services from other organisation(s), the SWD will refer the case for services provided by other social services units, such as Integrated Family Service Centres (IFSCs), Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness, and Integrated Children and Youth Services Centres. Schools or relevant social welfare organisations will provide students with emergency intervention services, such as assessments, support and counselling through individual, group or online mode.

  Regarding support for teachers' physical and psychological well-being, the EDB has set up the Teachers' Helpline since 2006 to support teachers in coping with stress at work and mental health problems. Apart from this, professional counselling services and face-to-face counselling will be provided as and when necessary, and professionals will be arranged to follow up relevant cases. Meanwhile, the service providers will organise talks on how to relieve stress for teachers. In addition, starting from the 2023/24 school year, the EDB has commissioned non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or tertiary institutions to organise courses on physical and mental health for teachers every year, covering topics on mental health, expressive arts, mindfulness and physical health, to enhance teachers' capacity at work.

(3) The SWD subvents The Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong to operate the Suicide Crisis Intervention Centre (SCIC), which offers immediate crisis intervention and in-depth counselling services for persons in need.The SCIC also renders support services to persons affected by suicidal behaviours (including familes and friends), including consultation hotline, groups, talks and workshops. Moreover, 67 territory-wide IFSCs (including two Integrated Service Centres), operated by the SWD or subvented NGOs also provide appropriate service and assistance for the families and relatives of suicide victims, including financial assistance, counselling service, and connection with community resources."
立法會二十一題︰保障教職員及學生的精神健康,2025-06-11 18:56,2025-06-11 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100302.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上郭玲麗議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆：

問題：

本港教職員及學生的精神健康情況備受社會關注。有意見認為，政府應加強保障他們的身心健康，也須為有關自殺者的家屬提供適切的支援服務。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年教職員及學童的自殺及企圖自殺的數目，以及當中有展開死因研訊的個案數目，並按學校類別（即（i）‍小學、（ii）中學及（iii）大學）列出分項數字；

（二）就教職員及學童企圖自殺的個案，政府的跟進及支援程序為何，包括涉及哪些政策局、其中提供支援服務的專業人士類別及介入的範疇及程度，以及其提供的支援服務詳情；及

（三）就第（一）項所述的自殺個案，政府有否為自殺者的家屬和親友提供支援服務（例如專業的情緒輔導服務）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；主要由哪些政府部門的人員向自殺者家屬提供協助，並告知其在法律上的權利（包括家屬可以要求召開死因研訊的權利）？

答覆：

主席：

教育局十分重視教師及學生的精神健康，一直鼓勵學校採用全校參與模式，透過跨部門、跨專業及跨界別合作，在「普及性」、「選擇性」、「針對性」三個層面，透過不同措施和活動，促進師生的精神健康，以及加強支援有精神健康需要（包括有自殺風險）的學生。近年，教育局推展多項支援學生精神健康措施，包括於二○二四／二五學年推行《4Rs精神健康約章》，協助學生建立健康的生活習慣和正面的人際關係，加強他們的抗逆力。此外，教育局於二○二三／二四學年起推出不同學習階段《精神健康素養資源套》。就郭玲麗議員提出的問題，經諮詢社會福利署（社署），現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）教育局一直要求中、小學匯報學生懷疑自殺身亡個案。過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）中、小學有關個案數目表列如下，當中中學生約佔總個案數目的百分之九十一，小學生則約佔百分之九。

教育局沒有收集教職員懷疑自殺身亡個案、學生企圖自殺個案、大學生的相關個案，以及有召開死因研訊的個案數目。

我們持續加強識別和支援有精神健康風險的學生，例如於二○二四／二五學年增辦約40個主題式的教師培訓工作坊，介紹支援有精神健康需要的學生的實用技巧、輔導方法和介入策略，以及為小學及中學學生家長舉辦家長教育講座系列，內容涵蓋有關子女精神健康的主題。

支援措施方面，若學校懷疑學生有自殺危機，學校會安排學校輔導人員（如學生輔導教師／學生輔導人員／學校社工）及早支援。如有需要，學校會尋求校本教育心理學家、臨床心理學家、精神科醫生、醫護或警務人員的專業支援，確保能採取適當的介入措施。為加強跨界別合作，政府於二○二三年十二月開始，在全港中學推行以學校為本的「三層應急機制」，結合校內的跨專業團隊、校外支援網絡和醫療服務。該機制的實施已延長至二○二五年底，並優化有關安排。

此外，政府於二○二四年四月設立跨部門轉介及協作機制。例如當警務人員處理在學校以外發生涉及中、小學學生的企圖自殺個案時，在獲取有關學生及家長／監護人的同意後，會透過教育局轉介個案至其現正就讀的學校接受支援服務。如學生及家長／監護人希望接受其他機構提供的支援服務，個案將由社署轉介至其他社會服務單位接受服務，例如綜合家庭服務中心、精神健康綜合社區中心及綜合青少年服務中心。學校或相關社會福利機構會透過個人、小組或線上形式，為學生提供評估、支援和輔導等應急介入服務。

在支援教師身心健康方面，教育局自二○○六年起設有教師陽光專線，除支援教師處理工作壓力及精神健康的問題外，亦會按需要提供專業輔導服務、面談和安排專業人士跟進有關個案。同時，提供服務的機構亦會為教師舉辦有關減輕壓力的講座。此外，由二○二三／二四學年起，教育局每年委託非政府機構或大專院校為教師舉辦有關身心健康的課程，內容涵蓋精神健康、表達藝術、靜觀及強健體魄，支援教師提升工作的能量。

（三）社署資助香港撒瑪利亞防止自殺會營運自殺危機處理中心（中心），為有需要的人士提供即時危機介入和深入輔導服務等。中心亦為受自殺行為影響的人士（包括自殺者家人及朋友）提供支援服務，包括電話諮詢、小組活動、講座及工作坊。另外，分布全港各區的67間由社署或受資助非政府機構營辦的綜合家庭服務中心（包括兩間綜合服務中心）亦會為自殺者家人及親友提供適切的服務和協助，包括經濟援助、輔導服務及連繫社區資源。"
粵港澳三地舉行公共衞生演習　為辦好十五運會和殘特奧會作準備（附圖）,2025-06-11 18:35,2025-06-11 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100757.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心今日（六月十一日）聯同廣東省及澳門衞生部門舉行代號「競鋒」的公共衞生演習，以提高三地在大型體育活動期間合作防治傳染病的能力，為今年十一月及十二月粵港澳聯合承辦的第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會），作好充分準備。

是次演習模擬兩名來港參加十五運會籃球賽事的球員，在港確診感染腦膜炎雙球菌。流行病學調查發現部分密切接觸者已經離港分別前赴深圳和澳門，本港遂按既定機制，立即向粵澳衞生部門作出通報。粵港澳三地的衞生部門亦迅速追蹤個案和採取適切控制措施，成功防止傳染病傳播。

衞生防護中心聯同廣東省疾病預防控制局、廣東省疾病預防控制中心及澳門衞生局於演習中透過視像會議就於十五運會和殘特奧會期間的傳染病監測、防控及通報機制進行線上演練與交流。三地的衞生部門共有超過30名人員參與是次演習。

衞生署署長林文健醫生在演習開始前致辭。他說：「十五運會和殘特奧會是國家規模最大、水準最高的綜合性體育盛會。在『雙賽』揭幕進入倒數階段，粵港澳三地衞生部門聯合開展是次傳染病防控演練，具有重大戰略意義。我們希望通過模擬實景，達致三大目標：強化三地聯防機制；築牢風險識別防線；及夯實賽事保障根基，讓全國頂尖健兒在『零重大疫情、零交叉感染』的賽場上展現國家的體育實力，同時向世界展現國家在公共衞生治理方面的卓越水準。」

林文健醫生續指，衞生防護中心自成立以來已累計舉辦三十二次應急演習及演練，包括模擬出現人類感染禽流感、麻疹、鼠疫和中東呼吸綜合症等個案的情況。粵港澳地緣相連、人文相通，唯有緊密協作方能應對重大公共衞生挑戰。粵港澳三地日後亦會繼續積極深化傳染病聯防聯控工作，在傳染病防控及公共衞生體系建設等方面，保持溝通與協作，共同提升全球公共衞生安全水平，以貫徹落實《粵港澳突發公共衞生事件應急合作協議》和《粵港澳大灣區衞生健康合作共識》。

"Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao hold public health exercise in preparation for hosting 15th NG, NGD and NSOG (with photos)",2025-06-11 18:35,2025-06-11 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100318.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health, in collaboration with the health authorities of Guangdong Province and Macao, today (June 11) conducted a public health exercise, code-named ""Jingfeng"", to enhance the capacity of the three places to co-operate in preventing and controlling communicable diseases during major sports events. The exercise was held in preparation for the 15th National Games (15th NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD), and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG), which will be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao this November and December.

The exercise simulated a scenario in which two players participating in the 15th NG basketball competition in Hong Kong were diagnosed with meningococcal infection while they were in the city. An epidemiological investigation revealed that some of their close contacts had already departed Hong Kong for Shenzhen and Macao respectively. In accordance with the established mechanism, Hong Kong immediately notified the health authorities of Guangdong and Macao. The health authorities of the three places promptly traced the cases and implemented appropriate infection control measures to prevent the spread of the communicable disease.

During the exercise, the CHP, together with the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Bureau of Macao conducted a drill and exchanged views on communicable disease surveillance, prevention, control and notification mechanisms during the 15th NG, and 12th NGD and 9th NSOG via a video conference. More than 30 officers from the health authorities of the three places participated in the exercise.

Before the commencement of the exercise, the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, gave a speech. ""The 15th NG, and NGD and NSOG are the largest and highest-level national multisport events in the country. It is of great strategic significance for the health authorities of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao to jointly organise this exercise on communicable disease prevention and control at the countdown stage of the opening of the Games. Through the simulation, we hope to achieve three major objectives: to strengthen the joint prevention mechanism of the three places; to build a solid risk identification defense; and to consolidate the foundation of event protection. This will allow the top athletes in the country to demonstrate the country's sports prowess under a 'zero significant outbreak, zero cross-infections' condition, and showcase the country's excellence in public health governance to the world,"" he said.

Dr Lam added that since its establishment, the CHP has organised a total of 32 emergency response exercises and drills, simulating human cases of avian influenza, measles, plagues and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. As Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao are geographically and culturally connected, only through close collaboration can the three centres cope with major public health challenges. In the future, the three places will continue to strengthen joint efforts in the prevention and control of communicable diseases. They will maintain communication and collaboration on aspects such as the prevention and control of communicable diseases, and the development of the public health system, with a view to enhancing global health safety standards. They will also fulfil the tripartite co-operation agreement on public health emergencies and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Health Cooperation Consensus.

Apart from the health authorities of the three places, representatives from the Medical and Health Office of the Comprehensive Security Department of the Guangdong Provincial Executive Committees for the 15th NG, NGD and NSOG, National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong)of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Auxiliary Medical Service, the Fire Services Department and the Hospital Authority have also sent their staff to observe the exercise."

LCQ2: Developing Hong Kong into international education hub,2025-06-11 17:53,2025-06-11 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100670.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chu Kwok-keung and a reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

 The Government is now establishing the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for education. There are views pointing out that with the robust development of local basic education and the extensive recognition of the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination qualification, primary and secondary schools are well-positioned to admit non-local students amid the continuing decline in the number of students. At present, however, entry for non-local students to study in Hong Kong's public or aided primary and secondary schools (other than English Schools Foundation (ESF) schools and Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) schools) is not permitted. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of minor students coming to Hong Kong on student visas to study in private primary and secondary schools, ESF schools, and DSS primary and secondary schools over the past three school years, as well as the distribution of their years of study;

(2) whether it will consider drawing on the practices of other countries to relax the eligibility criteria for student visas, so as to allow non-‍local minor students entry into Hong Kong to study in public or aided primary and secondary schools, as well as introducing student guardian visas for their parents to stay in Hong Kong and engage in time-limited employment; and

(3) whether it will consider encouraging private enterprises or educational institutions to establish additional student hostels or overseas students' apartments to provide accommodation and ancillary services suitable for students of different ages, as well as establishing corresponding licensing and registration regimes?

Reply:

President,

 The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the Government would promote the development of an international hub for post-secondary education by establishing the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand as well as pooling together and nurturing excellent global talents. The policy is built on the foundation that Hong Kong's universities enjoy an international reputation. Among our eight public universities, five are ranked among the world's top 100 and six within Asia's top 50, and four are among the top ten on the list of the most international universities in the world. The internationalisation and diversity of our post-secondary education attract outstanding talents from all over the world to Hong Kong for further studies and research. Meanwhile, the National 14th Five-Year Plan supports Hong Kong as a development centre in eight key areas (""eight centres""), the Education Bureau (EDB) has been proactively encouraging post-secondary education institutions to develop more related applied degree programmes to complement with the talent backing for the ""eight centres"". At the same time, we are also committed to promoting the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand, developing Hong Kong into an international education hub, attracting outstanding talent from all over the world in all aspects to enrich the local talent pool.

 Regarding our basic education, under the ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong has the distinctive advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world. We have been providing 12-year free and quality primary and secondary education to all local children through public sector schools, and parents of local children are offered with diversified choices. Meanwhile, non-local children can study in non-public sector schools, including international schools, private schools and Direct Subsidy Scheme schools, on a self-financing basis. These arrangements aim to ensure a reasonable balance between the supply and demand of school places in basic education in the relevant arrangements, while achieving prudent use of public funds. In fact, Hong Kong's diversified and quality school education system has long been ranked among the top in international education comparative studies.

 Having consulted the Security Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), our reply to the question raised by the Hon Chu Kwok-keung is as follows:

(1) In the past three years (2022 to 2024), a total of 1 686 applications for student visa/entry permit were approved by the ImmD for non-local children aged 17 or below coming to Hong Kong for education (see Annex). The ImmD and the EDB do not keep statistics on the types of schools admitting these students.

(2) The Government is committed to developing a vibrant international school sector to meet the demand for education from non-local families living in Hong Kong as well as children of families coming to Hong Kong for work or investment. International schools operate on a self-financing and market-driven basis and belong to the private school sector. They have been enjoying the flexibility, including the medium of instruction, curriculum arrangements, public examinations, etc, and they are not subsidised by public funds for daily operation, providing diversified choices for local parents, while offering school places to non-local children who pay school fees at their own expense under the ""user pays"" principle. As seen from the figures provided by the ImmD over the past three years, there have been hundreds non-local children aged from five years eight months to 17 years being approved with study visa/entry permit to come to Hong Kong for education annually. We will closely keep in view the demand for school places from non-local children, conduct dynamic assessments of the demand and supply of school places, create conditions in a timely manner, and launch policy measures to adjust the supply of school places including supporting the development of non-profit-making private schools offering non-local curriculum through the school allocation exercise. Meanwhile, we will proactively explore the feasibility of facilitating non-local students to come to Hong Kong to study in non-public sector schools on a self-financing basis.

 As the goal of public sector schools is to provide 12-year quality and free primary and secondary education to eligible children to meet the educational needs of local children, we adopt mother-tongue teaching. The medium of instruction, curriculum arrangements, public examination (i.e. Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination), etc in public sector schools are based on the learning needs of local children.

Therefore, for public sector schools, the Government has always been devoting substantial resources to public sector schools in providing quality education to students over the years, meeting the different learning needs of students in an all-round way, including catering for the learning diversity for students with special educational needs and non-Chinese speaking students with the provision of additional learning support and complementary measures. Public sector schools are publicly funded at full costs, offer local curriculum and serve local children. It ensures the prudent use of public funds and fair allocation of educational resources, and benefit local children.

 At present, the parallel development of the public sector schools and non-public sector schools not only caters for the learning needs of the children of different stakeholders, but also achieves the purpose of prudent use of public funds and an appropriate allocation of resources. Therefore, the policy meets Hong Kong's actual circumstances.

(3) In general, the boarding services provided by different types of schools are mainly aimed at enriching local students' learning experiences, and cater for the residential needs of a small number of non-local students. At present, there are a total of 16 publicly-funded and private ordinary primary and secondary schools across the territory, which provide boarding services offering about 3500 boarding places altogether. If individual schools have needs, and the premises and space allow, they can submit applications to the EDB to provide boarding facilities on a self-financing basis. We will consider the applications based on the actual needs. The facilities and management of boarding schools should comply with the relevant stipulations such as the Education Regulations (Cap. 279A). The accommodation arrangements outside schools should also comply with all relevant laws and requirements. The EDB will closely monitor the residential needs of non-local students, including the boarding facilities provided by different types of schools, and maintain communication with the education sector and relevant government departments to review the related arrangements in a timely manner.

 President, education is the key to a hundred-year plan. While being open to different views, the EDB will carefully consider each and every policy initiative to maintain the strengths of Hong Kong education, orderly promote the development of an international hub for post-secondary education, and strengthen the high quality development of education in Hong Kong.

 Thank you, President."
立法會二題︰發展香港成為國際教育樞紐,2025-06-11 17:53,2025-06-11 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100680.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上朱國強議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的答覆︰

問題︰

政府正打造「留學香港」品牌，發展香港成為國際教育樞紐。有意見指出，本地的基礎教育發展完善，香港中學文憑考試資歷廣受認可，在學童人數持續下跌之際，中小學有條件取錄非本地生。然而，現時本港不會批准非本地學生來港就讀公立或資助的小學及中學（英基學校協會學校及直接資助學校除外）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三個學年，持學生簽證來港就讀私立中小學、英基學校協會學校及直接資助中小學的未成年學生人數，以及其就讀年級的分布為何；

（二）會否考慮參考其他國家做法，放寬學生簽證資格，讓非本地未成年學生來港就讀公立或資助小學及中學，並設立陪讀簽證，供其家長來港居留及從事有時限工作；及

（三）會否考慮鼓勵私人企業或教育機構增設學生宿舍或留學公寓，提供適合不同年齡學生的住宿及配套服務，並制訂相應的牌照及註冊制度？

答覆：

主席：

行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》提出推進國際專上教育樞紐建設，打造「留學香港」品牌，匯聚和培育世界一流人才。有關政策是建基於香港的大學享譽國際，我們八所公營大學之中，五所進入世界百強，六所位列亞洲前五十強，四所在全球最國際化大學排名首十位。專上教育的國際化和多元化，吸引全球優秀人才來港升學和研究。國家「十四五」規劃確立香港作為八個重點領域的發展中心（「八大中心」），為此，教育局積極鼓勵各專上院校發展更多相應應用學位（課程），為「八大中心」做好人才支撐。同時，亦致力推廣「留學香港」品牌，建設香港成為國際教育樞紐，全方位吸引全球優秀人才，豐富本地的人才庫。

在基礎教育方面，「一國兩制」之下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，我們既通過公營學校，為所有本地兒童提供12年免費和優質的中小學教育，也透過非公營學校，包括國際學校、私立學校、直資計劃（直接資助計劃）學校，為本地家長提供多元選擇的同時，亦讓非本地兒童可以自費入讀，確保基礎教育的學額供求合理平衡，善用公帑。事實上，多元和優質的香港學校教育體系一直在國際教育比較研究中名列前茅。

就朱國強議員的提問，經諮詢保安局和入境事務處（入境處）後，重點回覆如下︰

（一）過去三年，即二○二二年至二○二四年，入境處共批出1686個學生簽證／進入許可，供17歲或以下的非本地人士來港就學（見附件）。入境處和教育局沒有備存上述學生就讀不同類別學校的統計數字。

（二）政府一直支持國際學校體系的蓬勃發展，以滿足在香港居住的非本地家庭，以及因工作或投資而來港居住的家庭子女的教育需要。國際學校以自負盈虧的市場模式運作，屬私立學校，在授課語言、課程安排、公開考試等方面享有彈性，日常營運不獲公帑資助，以「用者自付」原則，為本地家長提供多元選擇，亦讓非本地兒童自費入讀。從入境處過去三年的數字所見，每年均有約數百位年齡介乎五歲八個月至17歲的非本地人士獲批學生簽證／進入許可來港就學。我們會密切留意非本地兒童對學位的需求，動態評估學位供求情況，適時創設條件，推出政策措施，調整學額供應，包括透過校舍分配工作，支持提供非本地課程的非牟利私立學校的發展。同時亦會積極探討便利非本地生來港，以自費方式入讀非公營學校的可行性。

由於公營學校的目標是為合資格兒童提供12年優質的免費中小學教育，以滿足本地兒童的教育需要，所以我們採取母語教學，在授課語言、課程安排、公開考試，即香港中學文憑考試等，均以本地兒童的學習需要為依歸。

因此，就公營學校，政府投入大量資源為其學生提供優質教育，全方位滿足同學不同學習需要，包括為有特殊教育需要的學生、非華語學生等提供額外的學習支援和配套，照顧學習差異。公營學校全額由公帑資助，提供本地課程，確保善用公帑和公平分配教育資源，造福本地學童。

目前，公營學校與非公營學校雙線並行發展，照顧不同持份者子女的學習需要，我們要善用公帑和適當分配資源，所以雙軌並行的政策符合香港實況。

（三）一般而言，現時各類型學校設寄宿服務，主要是用作豐富本地學生學習經歷，以及照顧少量非本地學生的住宿需要。目前，全港總共有16所公帑資助及私立普通中小學提供宿舍服務，合共提供約3500個宿位。個別學校如有需要，在校舍、空間和配套條件許可的情況下，可向教育局申請以自資模式提供宿舍設施。我們會視乎實際需要，審批有關申請。寄宿學校的設施及管理須符合《教育規例》（第279A章）等有關規定；學校以外的住宿安排亦須符合相關法律及規定。教育局會密切留意非本地學生的住宿需要，包括不同類型學校所提供的寄宿設施，並會與學界及有關政府部門保持溝通，適時檢討相關安排。

主席，百年大計，教育為本，教育局會聆聽大家的意見，審慎考慮不同政策措施，發揮香港教育的優勢，有序推進國際專上教育樞紐建設，推動香港教育更高質量發展。

多謝主席。"

  A spokesman for the MD said, ""The objective of the SAR exercise is to test the communication efficiency, co-ordination capabilities and resource deployment among the SAR agencies in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. The exercise also aims to strengthen co-operation between Hong Kong and neighbouring regional SAR centres to enhance their response capabilities in the event of future major maritime emergency incidents.""

  The exercise simulated a collision between a cross-boundary high-speed passenger ferry carrying around 70 passengers from Macao to Hong Kong and a local oil tanker in the waters north of Shek Kwu Chau. The accident caused damage to the ferry's hull; two passengers on board went missing after falling overboard, and many passengers were injured. Following the collision accident, the local oil tanker caught fire, trapping a seriously injured crew member in the engine room.

  Under the co-ordination of the MD's Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, the participating SAR units took various contingency measures to carry out SAR operations. These operations included traffic regulation in the surrounding area to ensure safety at the scene to search for and rescue the missing persons who had fallen into the sea, extinguishing the fire on board the oil tanker, providing on-the-spot first aid to the injured, and deploying a helicopter to transfer the seriously injured to hospital for treatment. The exercise lasted about three hours, mobilising 17 SAR vessels, a helicopter and a total of more than 230 people.

  The MD regularly conducts exercises with various SAR units and maritime stakeholders to strengthen co-operation with SAR centres in neighbouring areas and provide effective and rapid SAR services."

食環署呼籲市民加強防範蚊患,2025-06-11 17:01,2025-06-11 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100303.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（六月十一日）公布，五月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之八點六，屬於二級水平，顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布情況頗為廣泛。相關政府部門已加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動。

五月份，在64個監察地區中，六個地區的分區誘蚊器指數高於百分之二十的警戒水平。有關的誘蚊器大多位於區內的私人住宅區、公共屋邨、學校、康樂設施及公眾地方，食環署已聯同相關政府部門立即採取行動，在有關地區加強防蚊及滅蚊工作。

另外，五月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點三，表示在發現有白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊成蚊的平均數量為一點三隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁www.fehd.gov.hk。

食環署發言人說：「本地蚊患情況與季節變化有顯著關係。在炎熱多雨的春夏月份（即五至九月），有利蚊子迅速繁殖，其間各監察地區的誘蚊器指數可能會相對較高。食環署提醒市民須繼續恆常的防蚊工作，特別是對構築物的維修及保養，填補隙縫、孔洞等可引致積水的潛在蚊子滋生地，減低蚊子滋生的機會。」

發言人續說：「政府關注五月份的蚊患情況，持續炎熱及有雨或導致該月白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數上升。食環署與相關政府部門已持續深化在各自管轄範圍的防蚊及滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊子滋生地、施放殺幼蟲劑、以霧化處理方式殺滅成蚊，並於適當位置設置捕蚊器等。食環署亦連同相關部門進行實地視察，並為部門提供專業意見和技術支援，協助它們迅速制訂和實施有效的滅蚊措施，同時加強公眾宣傳和教育。食環署會持續監察各區的蚊患情況，並迅速採取有效防治措施。」

食環署今年繼續分三期進行全港滅蚊運動，第二期滅蚊運動已於四月十四日展開，將於六月十三日結束。其間，食環署各分區辦事處會針對區內一些受關注的地點，例如公眾街巿、熟食中心和小販巿場等設施、單幢式樓宇、街道和後巷、大廈的公用地方、村屋、建築地盤、空置土地及路旁工地等，進行一連串的清除積水及防治蚊患行動。為進一步加強滅蚊的成效，食環署已聯同相關部門，於五月七日起展開第二期全城防蚊及滅蚊行動，除繼續第一期工作，包括清除潛在蚊子滋生地外，食環署呼籲私人物業管理公司及早維修處所以減少蚊子滋生地，並開始定時以超低微量噴灑方式殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器，以及在棄置的輪胎上鑽大洞。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。鄰近地區登革熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"
Public urged to strengthen anti-mosquito efforts,2025-06-11 17:01,2025-06-11 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100305.htm,"âThe Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (June 11) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in May was 8.6 per cent, at Level 2, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was fairly extensive. Relevant government departments have stepped up mosquito prevention and control actions.

In May, among the 64 survey areas, the area gravidtrap index in six areas exceeded the alert level of 20 per cent. The gravidtraps were mostly located in the vicinity of private residential areas, public housing estates, schools, recreational and sports facilities and public places. The FEHD has collaborated with relevant government departments by taking immediate action to strengthen mosquito prevention and control work in the area concerned.

Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in May was 1.3, which represented that an average of 1.3 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department website at www.fehd.gov.hk.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""There is a significant relationship between local mosquito infestation and seasonal changes. The gravidtrap indices in various survey areas would be relatively higher during hot and rainy spring and summer months (i.e. from May to September) as mosquitoes breed quickly. Members of the public are reminded to continue the routine mosquito prevention and control work, especially the repair and maintenance of structures. Cracks and dents that may accumulate water and become potential breeding grounds should be filled and levelled to reduce the chance of mosquito breeding.""

""The Government is concerned about the mosquito infestation in May. The increase in the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus for May might be related to the continuously hot and rainy days in the month. The FEHD has continued to intensify the mosquito prevention and control work with relevant government departments in areas under their purview, including eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and placing mosquito trapping devices at suitable locations. The FEHD has also conducted site inspections with relevant departments, and provided them with professional advice and technical support to assist them in formulating and implementing effective anti-mosquito measures swiftly. At the same time, the FEHD has strengthened publicity and education. The FEHD will continue to monitor the mosquito infestation in all districts, and will conduct prompt and effective mosquito prevention and control work,"" the spokesman continued.

The FEHD will conduct a three-phase Anti-mosquito Campaign this year. The second phase of the territory-wide campaign was launched on April 14 and will run until June 13. During the period, the district offices of the FEHD will target areas that have drawn particular concern, such as public markets, cooked food centres and hawker bazaars, single-block buildings, streets and back lanes, common parts of buildings, village houses, construction sites, vacant sites and road works sites, to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work. To further enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control, the FEHD and relevant government departments have carried out phase two of the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations from May 7. In addition to the work of phase one, including eliminating potential mosquito breeding places, the FEHD called on property management entities to arrange for necessary repairs to their premises to minimise mosquito breeding places and commence adult mosquito control measures by means of regular ultra-low volume fogging operations.

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes, and drilling large holes in unused tyres. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

Aedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit dengue fever (DF). DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization recorded over 14 million DF cases, which was a record number. The dengue activity in neighbouring areas has remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."

LCQ6: Supply of car parking spaces,2025-06-11 17:00,2025-06-11 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100257.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

Regarding the supply of car parking spaces, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information on parking spaces for various vehicle classes (including private cars, commercial vehicles and motorcycles) in Hong Kong from 2022 to 2024: the number of parking spaces, the district distribution, the utilisation rate, the increase or decrease in the number of parking spaces due to redevelopment, new development or other projects, with a tabulated breakdown by type of parking space (e.g. public or temporary car parks, on-street parking spaces); whether it has projected the parking space demand from this year to 2029, and of the currently planned number of parking spaces for various vehicle classes to be built, their locations, the government departments responsible for building them and their expected completion dates;

(2) whether it has plans to conduct a comprehensive review of the supply of parking spaces for various vehicle classes in the territory and study the further opening of car parks in schools and government premises in various districts in the evenings and on public holidays for public use; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether, on the pretext of not affecting traffic flow and road safety, it will consider increasing the number of free on-street parking spaces, extending the parking hours for night-time parking spaces and installing multi-storey stacked parking systems to improve land use efficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

In response to Oral Question 1, the Government has outlined its parking policy and I am not going to repeat it here. We will adopt a multi-pronged strategy to comprehensively increase parking supply, including leveraging technology, fostering stronger collaboration among stakeholders, and prioritising the parking needs of commercial vehicles (CVs).

Having consulted the Transport Department (TD), a consolidated reply in response to the questions raised by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu is as follows:

(1) Over the past three years, the total number of parking spaces in Hong Kong has increased by more than 15 000, bringing the total to over 800 000 (Annex 1). The ratio of parking spaces to registered vehicles has improved, and the number of metered parking spaces has also grown (Annex 2). However, the recovery of some short-term tenancy (STT) car parks has led to a slight decline in CV parking spaces (Annex 3). To address this, we have implemented various measures to enhance CV parking supply. For example, public vehicle parks (PVPs) currently in operation and under construction will provide approximately 460 CV parking spaces, and we have mandated a minimum number of CV parking spaces in suitable STT car parks. The Government continues to collaborate actively with stakeholders to expand parking supply. Between 2022 and 2024, more than 25 000 additional parking spaces were introduced under urban redevelopment projects (Annex 4). Utilisation rates remain consistently high across all types of parking spaces, with metered parking spaces averaging around 90 per cent and trending upward. Among public car parks managed by the TD, utilisation rates range from approximately 80 per cent to 90 per cent, while STT car parks average around 60 per cent.

When advancing PVP projects, the TD assesses district-level parking demand based on illegal parking occurrences and the availability of facilities near project sites. For example, priority is given to areas with a high concentration of logistics trades for additional CV parking spaces. The TD will also consider conducting studies to forecast medium-to-long-term parking needs.

The currently operating and under-construction PVPs will provide over 3 200 parking spaces. We are also exploring the adaptive reuse of construction shafts left after the completion of the Central Kowloon Bypass, with plans to convert them into underground multi-storey car parks featuring automated parking systems (APS).

Over the next two years, the Government will introduce 12 000 additional parking spaces, with at least 500 designated for CVs. The actual quantity will be even higher when accounting for additional CV parking spaces from upcoming STT car parks and private development projects.

Our priority remains the expansion of CV parking spaces, particularly in areas facing shortages, and we will intensify efforts to promote APS. Through policy initiatives and co-ordinated action with districts, we are confident that Hong Kong's parking supply will continue to improve. Projected parking space supply estimates beyond 2025 are detailed in Annex 5.

(2) The standard of parking facilities in the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines (HKPSG) will be reviewed regularly and revised when necessary to meet future transportation and policy needs. The first batch of subsidised housing planned under the revised HKPSG in 2021 (Note) is scheduled for completion in 2026, providing approximately 4 700 parking spaces across 26 subsidised housing developments. This includes 220 CV parking spaces, as well as the introduction of 33 medium/heavy goods vehicle and 18 coach/bus shared-use loading and unloading bays for night-time CV parking. The TD is closely monitoring the implementation of the revised HKPSG and will review it as needed to ensure it aligns with the latest developments.

The Government Property Agency has opened around 1 000 parking spaces within the 12 joint-user general office buildings under its management, with some parking spaces available for public use throughout the day. Additionally, public car parks managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department provide more than 2 700 parking spaces for public use. The TD is actively collaborating with the Housing Department to explore the possibility of opening loading/unloading bays in five subsidised housing developments, including Sha Tin and Tsuen Wan for night-time CV parking, given the substantial parking demand from medium and heavy goods vehicles in these areas. Furthermore, the TD is working with the Education Bureau to encourage more schools to make school bus parking spaces available for student service vehicles during non-school hours, specifically to address CV parking needs.

(3) The TD has been proactively identifying suitable locations across districts to provide additional on-street parking spaces. As of 2024, more than 1 860 on-street night-time parking spaces have been designated. The free parking period for over 600 CV night-time parking spaces has been adjusted to start at 7pm, and future provisions of such spaces will aim to advance the free parking period as much as possible.

The Government has been implementing APS projects in suitable PVPs and STT car parks, as APS can nearly double the parking capacity within the same space. PVPs currently under construction will provide 1 000 automated parking spaces. Additionally, seven private car parks and three STT car parks are already equipped with APS. The PVPs are located in Tseung Kwan O, San Po Kong, Sham Shui Po, and Ma On Shan, while the STT car parks are in Tsuen Wan, Tai Po, Sham Shui Po, and Yau Ma Tei. Various APS models are being adopted, including puzzle-stacking as proposed in the question, vertical lifting and horizontal sliding, as well as circular shaft lifting systems.

The widespread adoption of APS in Hong Kong requires private sector involvement from the society. Both the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the TD have published APS implementation guidelines for industry reference. In the future, the TD will actively encourage developers to adopt APS and explore further incentive measures.

Thank you, President.

Note: The 2021 he revised HKPSG has increased the number of ancillary parking spaces for PCs in private and subsidised housing developments, the types and numbers of parking spaces for CVs in subsidised housing development, and introduced two types of ""shared-use"" parking spaces, one of which is to be shared by light goods vehicles and light buses, and the other by medium/heavy goods vehicles and coaches."

問題：

關於泊車位的供應，政府可否告知本會：

（一）二○二二年至二○二四年全港各類泊車位（包括私家車、商用車及電單車）的以下資料：車位數目、地區分布、使用率，以及因重建、新建或其他項目而增減的泊車位數目，並按泊車位類別（例如公共或臨時停車場，以及路旁泊車位等）以表列出分項資料；有否預測本年至二○二九年的泊車位需求，以及現時計劃興建的各類泊車位數目及其所在位置、負責興建的政府部門及預計完工時間為何；

（二）有否計劃全面檢視全港各類泊車位的供應情況，並研究進一步開放各區學校及政府建築物的停車場予公眾於晚間及假日使用；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）會否考慮在不影響交通暢順及道路安全的前提下，增設免費路旁泊車位及延長夜間泊車位的泊車時段，並增設升降橫移式立體停車位以提高土地使用效率；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

我剛才回答第一項質詢時，已述及政府的泊車位政策原則，在此我不再重複。我們會採取多管齊下的策略，全方位增加泊車位，當中包括善用科技、推動各方加強合作，及優先滿足商用車輛的泊車需求。

就顏汶羽議員提問的各個部分，經諮詢運輸署後，我的綜合回覆如下：

（一）過去三年，全港泊車位增加超過15 000個，泊車位總數已上升至超過80萬個（附件一），泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例逐漸回升。收費路旁泊車位（咪錶位）數目亦有所增長（附件二）。因部分短期租約停車場被收回，商用車泊位稍微下降（附件三），我們已透過不同措施，增加商用車泊位，例如，已啓用及正在施工中的公眾停車場合共可提供約460個商用車泊位；以及在合適的短期租約停車場訂明最少須提供的商用車泊位數目。政府積極與各界合作，增加泊車位，在二○二二年至二○二四年間，因市區各地重建而增加的泊車位超過25 000個（附件四）。使用率方面，各類泊位的使用率持續高企，咪錶位平均達90%，並呈上升趨勢。運輸署轄下11個公眾停車場使用率介乎約80%至90%；短期租約停車場平均約60%。

在推展停車場項目時，運輸署會從地區層面估算未來的泊車位需求，包括檢視附近違例泊車情況及鄰近設施與配套，例如，在物流業較集中的地區，會優先考慮提供更多商用車泊位。運輸署也會積極考慮推展預測中長期泊車位需求的研究。

現時已啓用及正在施工中的政府公眾停車場項目合共可提供超過3 200個泊車位。我們正積極考慮善用中九龍繞道完工後留下的施工豎井，希望改建為地下多層停車場，並設置自動泊車系統。

政府未來兩年可新增12 000泊車位，當中至少500個為商用車泊位，增加的數目未包括將來的短期租約停車場及部份私人項目的商用車泊位，因此實際的數量將會更多。

我們會聚焦於增加商用車泊位，特別是較為短缺的地區，及加強推動自動泊車系統。透過我們的政策推動，加上和地區的配合，我們有信心香港泊車位供應將會持續改善。二○二五年後的泊車位供應估算載於附件五。

（二）政府不時檢視並適時修訂《香港規劃標準與準則》（《準則》）內的泊車設施標準，以滿足未來的運輸和交通政策需要。按二○二一年修訂的《準則》（註）規劃的首批資助房屋將於二○二六年落成，預計在26個資助房屋項目合共提供約4 700個泊車位，包括220個商用車泊位，其中有33個中／重型貨車及18個旅遊車／巴士共用上落客貨處可供車輛夜間停泊。運輸署正監察修訂《準則》的落實成效，適時檢視《準則》以確保與時並進。

政府產業署開放其轄下12個聯用辦公大樓約1 000個泊車位予公眾使用，部分車位更是全日開放。而康樂及文化事務署管理的公眾停車場提供超過2 700個泊車位。此外，運輸署正與房屋署積極探討率先在五個位於沙田、荃灣等有中／重型貨車停泊需求的公共屋邨的上落客貨處，在夜間開放給商用車停泊。運輸署亦正聯同教育局積極鼓勵學校於非上課時間，開放校內泊車位予學生服務車輛使用，希望針對性地滿足商用車的泊車需求。

（三）運輸署一直積極在各區物色合適位置增設路旁泊車位，截至二○二四年，全港已設置約1 860個路旁夜間商用車泊位，並將超過600個夜間商用車泊位的免費泊車時段提早至晚上七時開始，未來增設該類泊車位時，我們亦會盡量把免費泊車時段提早。

政府一直在合適的公眾停車場及短期租約停車場推展自動泊車系統，可有效提高同一空間的泊位高達一倍。施工中的公眾停車場項目有1 000個是自動化泊車位；另外，現時已有七個私人停車場及三個短期租約停車場設有自動泊車系統。興建中的政府公眾停車場位於將軍澳、新蒲崗、深水埗及馬鞍山；短期租約停車場則分布於荃灣、大埔、深水埗及油麻地，已採用問題提出的拼圖型，也有使用立體型及圓筒型系統。
​
香港要廣泛推展自動泊車系統，必須有社會上的私人發展商參與；機電工程署與運輸署已發布自動泊車系統的指引，供業界參考。未來運輸署會積極鼓勵發展商多應用自動泊車系統，並研究更多鼓勵措施。

多謝主席。

註：二○二一年修訂的《準則》上調了私人及資助房屋發展項目的私家車附屬泊車位數目，增加資助房屋發展項目的商用車泊位種類及數目，並引入兩款商用車輛「共用」泊車位，一款為輕型貨車及小型巴士共用，另一款為中型／重型貨車及旅遊巴共用。"

TheCityUK represents an industry that contributes 12 per cent to the UK's economic output and employs nearly 2.5 million people. Its role in supporting net zero transitions, economic growth, and essential services is remarkable. The UK's expertise in financial innovation and regulation makes it an ideal partner for Hong Kong.

 This MOU outlines a forward-looking framework for co-operation in key areas: transition finance, digital assets, technological advancements, and workforce development. A few highlights this partnership are worth noting.

 First, the focus on transition finance is critical as the world moves toward net zero. Hong Kong is a leader in green bonds issuance and sustainable finance, with initiatives like government green bonds issuance setting a global benchmark. TheCityUK and the FSDC will share best practices to advance transition finance across the Asia-Pacific and beyond, ensuring our financial systems support a low-carbon future.

 Second, the emphasis on digital assets aligns with the rapid evolution of our industry. Hong Kong is advancing fintech through initiatives like our Central Bank Digital Currency pilot and digital asset regulations. The UK's leadership in distributed ledger technology and tokenisation complements these efforts. Through this MOU, both parties will exchange insights on regulatory practices, promote interoperability, and build capacity for responsible integration of digital assets.

 Third, workforce development is central to our success. Technological advancements are reshaping financial services, and both Hong Kong and the UK are committed to equipping our professionals with the skills needed to thrive. Collaborative efforts will ensure our workforces are prepared for an era of innovation.

 The MOU also facilitates practical co-operation through market visits, stakeholder introductions, and co-hosted events. These initiatives will strengthen the ties between our financial communities and drive meaningful outcomes.

 The economic ties between Hong Kong and the UK provide a strong foundation for this partnership. Our shared commitment to open markets, innovation, and excellence has long underpinned our collaboration. This MOU builds on that legacy, creating new avenues for partnership at a time when global challenges like climate change and technological disruption demand collective action. Together, we can unlock opportunities for growth and prosperity.

 I extend my heartfelt congratulations to TheCityUK and the FSDC for their vision and leadership. My gratitude goes to all who have worked to bring this MOU to fruition. Your efforts have laid the groundwork for a stronger financial relationship between our jurisdictions.

 Let us seize this opportunity to deepen our collaboration, leverage our strengths, and promote Hong Kong and the UK as leading global financial centres. Together, we can shape a future defined by innovation, sustainability, and opportunity.

Thank you, and I wish this partnership every success."
"SFST's speech at Hong Kong Association Membership Luncheon in London, United Kingdom (English only) (with photos)",2025-06-11 16:31,2025-06-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100339.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Hong Kong Association Membership Luncheon on ""Extending, Embracing, Enhancing - Hong Kong's Role as a Premier International Financial Centre"" in London, the United Kingdom (UK), on June 10 (London time):

Lord Mayor (696th Lord Mayor of the City of London, Mr Alderman Alastair King), Sir Douglas (Committee Member of the Hong Kong Association, Chairman of Aberdeen Group, Sir Douglas Flint), distinguished guests, esteemed members of the Hong Kong Association, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon. It is a profound privilege to address you today at this distinguished luncheon hosted by the Hong Kong Association in London. I must say, you are a crowd too difficult to please because you know Hong Kong too well. This organisation's mission is to champion the enduring business and trading relationship between Hong Kong and the UK which resonates deeply with the Government's goal of fostering economic collaboration, innovation, and mutual prosperity. To further the efforts, I am here to showcase our city's unparalleled strengths as a global financial hub and to explore the vast potential for deepening financial co-operation between Hong Kong and the UK. Our shared visions and complementary expertise position us well to forge a partnership that drives transformative growth in an increasingly challenging and also uncertain global economy.

 If you may recall, for those people who came two years ago for a similar occasion where I spoke, I tried to group my speech in five alphabet letters, ABCDE. A is about Asia, B is about business as usual, C is about connectivity, D is about digitalisation whereas E is about ESG (environmental, social and governance). These are the five elements at the time I drafted the speech that something Hong Kong could offer to this part of the world. So I am thinking, to this group which is very knowledgeable about Hong Kong, what should I say and how I should structure this speech? Of course I don't want to get to the next alphabet letter after E, that is why I would stay at E and come with 3Es which are actually the pillars that define Hong Kong's strategic vision as a premier international financial centre: 1) Extending our financial value chain across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. For those in the banking or financial world, you know what I mean. It's about EFICC; 2) Embracing new finance through fintech and green finance; and 3) Enhancing offerings for Chinese companies going global through Hong Kong and international firms accessing the Mainland market. These pillars reflect our dynamic approach to navigating global economic and geopolitical challenges, seizing emerging opportunities, and fostering collaboration with partners like the UK. Let me elaborate on each pillar, highlighting our recent achievements and the opportunities they present for strengthening Hong Kong-UK ties.

Extending our financial value chain

 Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub is built on its ability to offer a diversified, resilient, and innovative financial ecosystem. By extending our financial value chain across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities which can be grouped as EFICC, we are creating a robust platform that serves both regional and international markets, fostering opportunities for collaboration with global partners, including the UK.

Equities: a vibrant and forward-looking market

 Hong Kong's equity market has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past decade, driven by bold structural reforms and a commitment to capturing global economic trends. The Hang Seng Index, which is a key barometer of our market's performance, has demonstrated resilience amid global uncertainties. By May 30, our stock market capitalisation has increased by 24 per cent year on year to over US$5.2 trillion. This growth was propelled, I must say, by a number of key moments this year, including of course the DeepSeek moment when people really recalibrate the value that Chinese investment carry and at the same time also the ""victory day"" moment when people are seeing the uncertainty in other parts of the world which actually present opportunities to Hong Kong and London. The average daily turnover for the first five months of this year stood at US$31 billion in our market, an increase of 1.2 times over the past year, signaling sustained investor confidence and market liquidity.

 Apart from the market performance, we are also trying to reform our capital market to make it more instrumental in positioning Hong Kong as a global hub for new economy and technology companies. Back in 2018, we already introduced the ""weighted voting rights"" regime, enabling companies with dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong. As I know, London Stock Exchange is also contemplating something similar to reform your stock market. This reform in Hong Kong attracted technology giants and paved the way for a new era of innovation-driven listings. Simultaneously, we opened our market to pre-revenue biotech firms, transforming Hong Kong into one of the world's leading fundraising hubs for biotechnology. As a result, the proportion of new economy companies in our stock market has surged from 1.3 per cent in 2018 to approximately 14 per cent by April 2025, with their market capitalisation share rising from 2.8 per cent to about 28 per cent.

 Building on this momentum, we introduced the ""18C"" listing regime in 2023 for specialist technology companies, followed by a dedicated technology enterprises channel launched last month. These initiatives are designed to accelerate the listing of enterprises in the ""hard technology"" space, enabling them to raise capital in Hong Kong and expand their international presence. These reforms have not only reshaped the structure of our stock market but also aligned it with global economic trends, positioning Hong Kong as a vital partner for UK firms seeking exposure to Asia's innovation-driven growth.

 Moreover, Hong Kong's capital markets have benefited from the return of Chinese concept stocks, driven by geopolitical developments and Mainland China's technological advancements. This trend has elevated the weight of technology stocks in our market, further enhancing its attractiveness to global investors. For example, before I came, we welcomed the listing of CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited) which is a major lithium-ion battery manufacturing company serving the world for electric vehicles. For UK financial institutions, Hong Kong offers a gateway to invest in Asia's burgeoning tech sector, leveraging our deep liquidity and robust regulatory framework.

Connectivity and stability

 Apart from fundraising, it's about our strengthened role as a gateway for international investors accessing Mainland China and for Mainland investors diversifying globally. Our ""Connect"" schemes - Stock Connect, Bond Connect, Wealth Management Connect, and Swap Connect - have facilitated seamless cross-border capital flows. These initiatives have seen significant growth in transaction volumes, product diversity, and risk management capabilities, enhancing both the ""quantity"" and ""quality"" of financial connectivity, covering the broad financial value chain across equities, fixed income and currencies.

 Stability is also a cornerstone of our financial system, as demonstrated by the performance of the Hong Kong dollar recently. In the first five months of 2025, the Hong Kong dollar largely traded within the strong-side convertibility undertaking range, signifying a robust demand, partly because a lot of money coming to Hong Kong to buy our IPOs (initial public offerings) which are in Hong Kong dollars, and at the same time it is now the season when the listed companies need Hong Kong dollars to give out dividends. So with this background, what we see is operations by our banking regulator where now the banking system aggregate balances rising to US$22 billion by May 30, 2025, a substantial increase from US$5.7 billion at the end of last year. Total bank deposits grew by over 4 per cent in the first four months of 2025, with Hong Kong dollar deposits rising by 4.4 per cent, reflecting strong capital inflows into our banking system. So you have been hearing a lot about capital flight from Hong Kong to others, all these numbers are testaments to how wrong those perceptions are. This stability underscores our role as a trusted financial hub, like that of London, offering a secure environment for UK investors and businesses.

 Amid global economic uncertainties, including trade protectionism and unilateral policies, RMB (Renminbi) is gaining prominence as a global transaction and reserve currency. Its share in global payments rose from 2 per cent in 2020 to 4 per cent by the end of 2024, ranking fourth globally, while its share in trade financing increased from 2 per cent to 6 per cent. As the world's leading offshore RMB hub, Hong Kong is seizing this opportunity by enhancing RMB-denominated investment products and risk management tools. Our plan to integrate RMB-denominated stock trading into Southbound Stock Connect will further support RMB internationalisation in a gradual and prudent manner, creating opportunities for UK financial institutions to engage with RMB-based products and services.

Commodities: pioneering a new ecosystem with LME integration

 In the commodities sector, Hong Kong is capitalising on the global surge in non-ferrous metals trading, driven by the transition to new energy technologies. In 2024, the London Metal Exchange (LME) recorded trading volumes of 178 million lots, a 20 per cent year-on-year increase, with significant growth in new-energy metals like nickel and cobalt. These metals are critical to industrial transformation and technological advancement, and China remains a pivotal force, with non-ferrous metals trade exceeding US$368 billion in 2024, up 11 per cent from the previous year.

 Recognising this potential, our Chief Executive outlined a vision in his Policy Address to create a commodity trading ecosystem in Hong Kong, encompassing warehousing, distribution, trading, testing, certification, insurance, and financial services. A landmark achievement in this regard is our integration into the LME's global warehouse network in January this year. By bringing storage facilities closer to Mainland China's industrial heartlands and consumption centres, we are strengthening our role as a central platform for the metals industry. Within months since January this year when we are recognised as a delivery port for the LME contracts, seven warehouses have already been approved, and their operations will commence as early as in July 2025.

 This initiative not only enhances Hong Kong's commodities infrastructure but also creates significant opportunities for UK firms, given the LME's London-based heritage. The UK's expertise in commodities trading and Hong Kong's proximity to Asia's industrial markets make our partnership a natural fit. By collaborating on warehousing, trading, and related services, we can jointly tap into the growing demand for new-energy metals, supporting global industrial transformation and sustainable development.

 By extending our financial value chain across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities, Hong Kong is reinforcing its position as a diversified financial hub. We invite UK businesses to leverage our platform to access Asia's dynamic markets, fostering mutual growth and collaboration in these critical sectors.

Embracing new finance: fintech and green finance

 The second pillar of our strategy is embracing new finance, particularly in fintech and green finance, to position Hong Kong at the forefront of financial innovation and sustainability. These areas align closely with the UK's developments in digital finance and sustainable investments, creating fertile ground for partnership.

Fintech: pioneering digital assets and stablecoin regulation

 Hong Kong's robust regulatory framework, business-friendly environment, and strategic location make it an ideal hub for fintech innovation. My bureau, FSTB (Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau), in collaboration with financial regulators and industry stakeholders, is pursuing a multipronged strategy to foster a vibrant fintech ecosystem. This includes enhancing financial infrastructures, nurturing talent, strengthening industry connections in Mainland China and overseas, and creating a conducive environment for fintech innovation.

 This is my second day here in London and I am hearing a lot about digital assets (DAs). Just days before I embarked on this trip, our Legislative Council has passed the Stablecoins legislation in Hong Kong and it will be enacted on August 1. After that, we will issue a second policy statement about promoting Hong Kong as the digital asset ecosystem.

 Looking ahead, we will continue to be a leader in adopting emerging technologies. A 2023 survey revealed that 38 per cent of Hong Kong's financial institutions adopted generative AI, surpassing the global average of 26 per cent. In October last year, we issued a policy statement on the responsible use of AI in finance, followed by practical guidelines, sandbox schemes, and industry seminars to support institutions in adopting AI responsibly. These initiatives position Hong Kong as a hub for fintech innovation, complementing the UK's advancements in areas like blockchain and AI-driven financial services.

Green finance: driving sustainable development

 Moving on to green finance, Hong Kong is committed to mobilising cross-border investments to address climate and sustainability challenges, aligning with global efforts to achieve net zero. Last year, Hong Kong arranged US$43 billion in green and sustainable bonds, capturing 45 per cent of the Asian market and ranking first in the region for seven consecutive years. By March this year, our security regulator authorised around 220 ESG funds, managing US$140 billion in assets, an 80 per cent increase over three years.

 Last week we have just issued a new round of Government green bonds and infrastructure bonds, totally around US$3.5 billion, denominated in four currencies, namely HKD (Hong Kong dollars), RMB, USD (US dollars) and EUR (euro). The offering attracted participation from a wide spectrum of investors from more than 30 markets across Asia, Europe, Middle East, and the Americas, with total orders amounting around US$30 billion equivalent, representing an over-subscription of almost nine times. The proceeds from green bond issuance will fund local Government green works projects, and set benchmarks for the market encouraging private-sector participation.

 To align with global standards, we launched the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in December last year, providing a clear path for large publicly accountable entities to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB Standards) by 2028. This positions Hong Kong among the first jurisdictions to align with global sustainability reporting standards, enhancing transparency and comparability. The roadmap not only reflects our commitment to the global green transition but also offers clarity and guidance to market participants.

 On the funding support side, the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme, which was extended to 2027, subsidises issuance costs for bonds and loans, including transition financing, encouraging industries across the Greater Bay Area and Belt and Road economies to leverage Hong Kong's platform for low-carbon transitions. So for many of you who are working for business financial institutions or companies, do take this message home that we are subsidising for people who are issuing green bonds and loans in Hong Kong.

 These efforts create significant opportunities for UK firms to collaborate with Hong Kong on green finance initiatives, from ESG funds to green technology solutions, leveraging our shared commitment to sustainability and innovation. The UK's commitment in green finance, combined with Hong Kong's strategic position in Asia, can drive impactful partnerships in sustainable investment and technology.

Enhancing offerings for global and Mainland businesses

 The third pillar, enhancing offerings, underscores Hong Kong's role as a bridge for Chinese companies going global and international firms accessing Mainland China, supported by policies that facilitate cross-border mobility and business expansion.

Supporting Chinese companies going global

 As Mainland China accelerates its economic opening, Chinese firms are intensifying their global expansion, optimising supply chains and market presence to address geopolitical risks and tap into international markets. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to support this ""going out"" strategy, offering financing, supply chain management, and professional services under the ""one country, two systems"" framework.

 Hong Kong's efforts to strengthen ties with emerging markets further enhance our appeal. In October last year, we facilitated the listing of two Hong Kong-focused exchange-traded funds on the Saudi Exchange, attracting Middle Eastern capital to our markets. The two Saudi-listed ETFs have a combined size of over US$1.9 billion. They are the two largest ETFs listed and are amongst the top traded ETFs on Saudi Stock Exchange. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to connecting traditional and emerging markets, offering UK firms a platform to diversify their investments across Asia and beyond.

 Hong Kong's professional services, for example the Accounting sector, are well-positioned and experienced to meet the needs of Mainland firms going global. The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has earlier compiled a list of firms specialising in supporting global expansion of Chinese companies, and has recently expanded the list from 60 to over 80 firms, connecting Mainland enterprises with international markets for business expansion. Moreover, Hong Kong's network of 52 Comprehensive Double Taxation Agreements with other tax jurisdictions, with plans for further expansion, provides tax clarity for businesses, enhancing Hong Kong's appeal as a commercial and investment hub.

 UK firms can partner with Hong Kong to support Chinese companies' international ventures, leveraging our expertise in financing, legal services, and market access. For example, UK financial institutions can collaborate with Hong Kong-based firms to provide advisory services, underwriting, and risk management solutions for Chinese enterprises expanding into Europe and beyond.

Facilitating international access to the Mainland

 Hong Kong is equally committed to helping international talents, including those from the UK, access Mainland China's vast market. A facilitating policy introduced in July last year allows non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents to obtain a cardâtype document with five-year validity. This card enables self-service clearance at Mainland control points without going through manual channels, eliminating the need for arrival cards and significantly enhancing clearance efficiency. This measure, implemented under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, facilitates business, travel, and family visits, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a gateway to the Mainland.

 Hong Kong's professional services, with deep knowledge of Mainland business culture and international expertise, provide comprehensive support for UK firms navigating China's market. From legal and accounting services to supply chain management, Hong Kong offers a trusted platform for UK companies to establish and grow their presence in Asia.

Hong Kong-UK financial co-operation

 The complementary strengths between the two markets of Hong Kong and UK create a strong foundation for collaboration. The integration of Hong Kong into the LME's warehouse network opens new avenues for UK firms to engage with Asia's commodities markets, particularly in new-energy metals critical to the global energy transition. Our leadership in green finance aligns with the UK's expertise in sustainable investments, creating opportunities for joint ventures in ESG funds, carbon trading, and green fintech. In fintech, Hong Kong's progressive DA regulations complement the UK's advancements in digital finance, paving the way for collaborative innovation in areas like blockchain, AI, and stablecoins.

 By leveraging Hong Kong's strengths in extending our financial value chain, embracing new finance, and enhancing global and Mainland connectivity, we invite UK businesses to partner with us in tapping Asia's growth opportunities. Our shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and global connectivity positions us to build a future of mutual prosperity.

Conclusion

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong stands at the forefront of global finance, driven by our commitment to the 3Es: Extending our financial value chain across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities; Embracing fintech and green finance; and Enhancing opportunities for Chinese and international businesses. Our unique position under ""one country, two systems,"" robust regulatory framework, and vibrant markets make Hong Kong the ideal partner for the UK in navigating Asia's dynamic markets.

 I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Hong Kong Association for hosting this luncheon and for your unwavering commitment to strengthening Hong Kong-UK ties. Let us seize this opportunity to deepen our financial partnership, fostering innovation, sustainability, and prosperity for our shared future. Together, we can shape a world of opportunity, leveraging Hong Kong's strengths and the UK's global leadership to drive transformative growth.

 Thank you."
