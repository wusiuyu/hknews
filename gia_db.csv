Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-20 17:30,2025-12-20 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000555.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 20), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

海關人員及海關搜查犬於十二月十八日在香港國際機場執行反私煙行動其間，截查兩名分別為三十歲及三十五歲的抵港男旅客，並在其個人行李內共檢獲約九萬九千支未完稅香煙，估計總市值約四十四萬四千元，應課稅值約三十二萬六千元。兩名旅客隨即被捕。他們今日在西九龍裁判法院各被判處監禁五個月，罰款一千五百元。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-12-20 17:05,2025-12-20 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000495.htm,"âTwo incoming male passengers were both sentenced to 5 months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (December 20) for possession of dutiable cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

During an anti-illicit cigarette operation conducted by Customs officers and Customs detector dog at Hong Kong International Airport on December 18, two incoming male passengers, aged 30 and 35, were intercepted and about 99 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from their personal baggage, with an estimated market value of about $444,000 and a duty potential of about $326,000. The passengers were subsequently arrested. They were both sentenced to 5 months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

  Due to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the school premises of Tai Po Baptist Public School will remain closed for a period of time. As a transitional measure, the EDB has arranged for students of Tai Po Baptist Public School to resume face-to-face classes by grade level at the school premises of Tai Po Government Primary School and NTWJWA Christian Remembrance of Grace Primary School respectively, from the 15th of this month until the end of the current school year.

ï»¿  A spokesperson for the EDB said, ""To enable all students of Tai Po Baptist Public School to continue their studies in a stable and continuous learning environment as early as possible, and to further safeguard students’ well-being, following discussions between the EDB and relevant government departments, the school premises of the former Kei Ching Primary School (originally planned to be converted into an integrated social service complex) will be allocated to Tai Po Baptist Public School for use as its school premises from the 2026/27 school year, allowing all classes to resume normal teaching and learning activities at a single school site.ï»¿""

Deputy Commissioner of Police encourages graduates to jointly safeguard Hong Kong citizens (with photos),2025-12-20 13:32,2025-12-20 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000305.htm,"The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Operations), Mr Yip Wan-lung, inspected the passing-out parade of 34 probationary inspectors and 187 recruit police constables at the Hong Kong Police College today (December 20), and witnessed them joining the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) to shoulder the noble mission of safeguarding Hong Kong and protecting citizens.

In his address, Mr Yip said that upon officially taking up frontline duties, graduates must bear in mind that they are not merely law enforcers, but also guardians ensuring a peaceful and safe living environment for the citizens. He hoped they would embody the professional spirit of ""going the extra mile"" and ""thinking more carefully and deeply"".

He highlighted that, in response to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po last month, various government units worked in concert to provide comprehensive support to affected victims throughout rescue and recovery efforts. The HKPF also mobilised a significant number of officers to assist in rescue operation and follow-up relief work, and conduct investigation.

He said police officers tried to promptly ascertain the status of missing persons for the distressed families, sparing them enduring regret. Professional investigation has been initiated with a view to holding those responsible accountable and upholding justice. Officers endured psychological stress in the search for bodies at the fire scene. They also maintained order to facilitate citizens who wished to pay their respects, while remaining vigilant against a small minority of ill-intentioned individuals seeking to exploit the disaster to sow discord, divide society, or even disrupt emergency recovery efforts. He described these police tasks as profoundly meaningful yet immensely challenging.

He pointed out that, by staying united and steadfast in carrying out their duties, Force members completed a large-scale search operation, which was originally expected to take several weeks, in approximately one week. This once again demonstrated the HKPF's spirit of ""rising to the challenges and emerging even stronger"".

Mr Yip concluded that policing has always been a demanding profession, marked by unforeseeable challenges, weighty responsibilities and a long journey ahead. He urged the graduates to stay committed to their original aspiration and to uphold the spirit of ""rising to the challenges and emerging even stronger"" when facing future challenges. He emphasised that it should serve as the driving force inspiring them to shoulder their mission with dedication, to strive forward with renewed vigour, and to pursue excellence."

葉雲龍致辭時表示，學員正式投入前線工作後要謹記，他們不單是執法者，更是市民安心生活背後的守護者，希望他們可以發揮「行多一步」和「多思多想」的專業精神。

他提到上月發生的大埔宏福苑火災，從救災到善後，政府各部門同心協力，全方位支援災民。警隊亦投入大量人手協助救援、跟進善後和展開調查。

他指，警務人員盡快為焦急等待的家屬確定失聯人士的情況，不讓家屬留下遺憾；透過專業調查，以期將需要承擔責任的人繩之於法，守護應有的公義；承受心理衝擊和壓力進入災場搜索遺體；維持秩序，一方面便利市民進行悼念，另一方面保持警覺，防止極少數別有用心的人以災亂港，分化社會，甚至破壞緊急善後工作。他形容這些警務工作極具意義但亦充滿挑戰。

他表示，警隊上下一心，緊守崗位，以約一星期完成原預計需要多個星期才可完成的大型搜索行動，再次證明警隊「迎難而上，遇強越強」的精神。

葉雲龍指，從來警務工作都殊不簡單，無時無刻也有機會面對不可預計的挑戰，任重而道遠。他勉勵結業學員，日後面對各種挑戰時也要銘記初心和「迎難而上，遇強越強」的精神，作為推動他們肩負使命同責任，繼續奮發向前，精益求精的動力。"

運輸及物流局發言人表示：「項目沿線地勢起伏，其中華富邨與香港仔海旁的高度相差超過60米，如採用重型鐵路，走線須深入地底，運輸及成本效益皆不理想，方案在財務上不可行。我們以創新思維，迎難而上，選擇採用在專屬高架橋及隧道行走的智慧綠色集體運輸系統，提高整體成本效益。與原來的地底重鐵方案相比，建造成本預算可減少約四成，落成時間則可提前約兩年。」

政府已邀請港鐵公司開展南港島線（西段）的詳細規劃及設計，並將與港鐵公司協商項目的財務安排。南港島線（西段）的前期工程預計於二○二七年展開及於二○三四年或之前竣工，以配合區內發展包括華富邨重建計劃新增人口遷入的時間表。"
Government invites MTRCL to proceed with detailed planning and design of South Island Line (West) project,2025-12-20 10:15,2025-12-20 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000214.htm,"âThe Chief Executive in Council has given approval for the Government to invite the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to proceed with the detailed planning and design of the South Island Line (West) (SIL(W)) project.

The SIL(W) project will adopt a smart and green mass transit system and consist of an approximately 7.5-km long dedicated and elevated corridor and tunnel, eight stations (namely Wong Chuk Hang, Aberdeen, Tin Wan, Wah Kwai, Wah Fu, Cyberport, Queen Mary Hospital and HKU) and a depot near the Cyberport Station. It will provide stable, environmentally friendly and convenient feeder service for around 130 000 residents and major facilities such as the Queen Mary Hospital and Cyberport in the western and southern parts of Hong Kong Island, facilitating them to go to Wong Chuk Hang Station of the South Island Line (East) and HKU Station of the Island Line. It will form a transit loop with the South Island Line (East) and Island Line, and will improve the resilience of the railway network.

The SIL(W) will provide residents in the area with an alternative traveling option of new mass transit-based transportation in lieu of road-based transportation, enjoying a shorter journey time. The existing journey time from Wah Fu Estate to Admiralty via Wong Chuk Hang is about 35 minutes and that from Wah Fu Estate to HKU is about 25 minutes. After the commissioning of the SIL(W), the journey time to the two destinations will be reduced to about 20 minutes and 10 minutes respectively.

A spokesperson of the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The alignment of the project passes through hilly terrains. The difference in altitude between Wah Fu Estate and Aberdeen promenade is over 60 metres. If heavy rail system were adopted, some sections would have to be built deep underground. The transport benefit and cost effectiveness are both unsatisfactory, making the underground heavy rail scheme financially not viable. Exercising an innovative approach to rise to the challenges, we decided to adopt a smart and green mass transit system which runs on dedicated elevated viaducts and tunnels to improve the overall cost effectiveness. Compared with the original underground heavy rail scheme, the estimated construction cost is reduced by about 40 per cent and the delivery programme is advanced by about two years.""

The Government has invited the MTRCL to proceed with the detailed planning and design of the SIL(W) project, and will further negotiate with the MTRCL on the financial arrangement of the project. It is targeted to commence the advance construction works in 2027 for completion by 2034 to support developments in the area including the timetable of new population intake of the Wah Fu Estate redevelopment."

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-19 22:41,2025-12-19 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900995.htm,"  âThe Independent Committee in relation to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po convened the first meeting today (December 19). The Committee has formally commenced work.

 Moreover, the three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
-----------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.5 billion as of noon today. With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.8 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The Government earlier announced that a living allowance from the Support Fund will be provided to each affected household, and the amount has been increased from $50,000 to $100,000. As of today, 1 929 cases have been processed. In addition, the Government will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 144 cases have been processed. The allowance will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, providing the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service to more than 4 900 residents. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Accommodation support
-----------------------------------

 Currently, there is still a supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer-term accommodation. The transitional housing and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects in different districts can altogether provide around 400 units at the moment. Moreover, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

 As of this morning, a total of 613 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 552 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 503 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the HKHS or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

 The Transport Department (TD) has been steering public transport operators (PTOs) to enhance services of franchised buses, green minibuses and residents' services by deploying additional vehicles and manpower to support residents affected by the fire who have been admitted into transitional housing in various districts, facilitating transfers to other services to and from different districts. Among them, an additional shuttle bus service will be launched connecting Lok Sin Village in Tai Po and Tai Po Market Station; while KMB will extend the service hours of 75K. The TD will closely co-ordinate with operating organisations of transitional housing projects concerned and PTOs to cater for residents' commuting needs.

Relief supplies and donations
-----------------------------------

 Thesupplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received around 2 000 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 29 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

 The Buildings Department (BD) today issued a practice note (available in Chinese only) to registered contractors, setting out a new mechanism for sampling scaffold nets in Hong Kong announced last week. The new mechanism applies to scaffold nets used in repair projects, as well as to those used in new building works.

 To facilitate the implementation of the new mechanism, the BD announced on its website the first batch of designated laboratories and will continuously update the list. Furthermore, the Construction Industry Council (CIC) is preparing for collective bulk procurement and coordinating testing services. The Hong Kong Institute of Construction San Tin Training Ground has been selected as the site for the industry to arrange off-site sampling. The Government and the CIC will work towards having the first batch of scaffold nets reinstalled within a month after procurement and testing.

Others
-----------------------------------

 The Government today invoked Section 31 of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) and submitted an application to the Lands Tribunal for the dissolution of the existing management committee of the owners' corporation (OC) of Wang Fuk Court. It has also proposed appointing Hop On Management Company Limited (Hop On) under the Chinachem Group as the designated administrator to assist the owners of Wang Fuk Court in handling various management and follow-up matters after the fire. If the Lands Tribunal approves the application, the Home Affairs Department will establish a dedicated team to work closely with Hop On in closely following up on various aspects of building management. This includes handling works contract, following up on insurance claims, financial management, and offering support to residents, etc. Hop On has explicitly stated that it will operate on a pro bono basis for this appointment. At the same time, Nina Wang Charity Management Limited has also expressed that if the Lands Tribunal approves the application, it will donate $5 million to the OC to cover the costs associated with employing lawyers, accountants, or other professional services."
​政府公布跟進大埔火災最新情況,2025-12-19 22:18,2025-12-19 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900976.htm,"就大埔宏福苑火災成立的獨立委員會今日（十二月十九日）召開第一次會議，委員會的工作正式展開。

Through risk assessment, Customs inspected two air parcels, declared as food and candy and arriving in Hong Kong from Mexico on December 12. Upon inspection, Customs officers found that the parcels contained about 20 kilograms of suspected liquid methamphetamine disguised as protective liquid for natural stones in five plastic bottles.

After a follow-up investigation, Customs officers conducted a controlled delivery operation yesterday and arrested two female suspects in Yuen Long and Tsim Sha Tsui, aged 28 and 45 respectively. Later, Customs further seized about 10 suspected cannabis oil vape capsules, about 4 grams of suspected cannabis buds, about 3 grams of suspected cocaine and about 270 grams of suspected cracked cocaine upon premises search in Tsim Sha Tsui. The investigation of the case is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people, nor to release their personal data or home address to others for receiving parcels or goods.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Customs reminds people to pay attention to the fact that drug trafficking is a serious criminal offence. Criminal conviction will result in grave repercussions for their future and they should not take risks in the hope that they may not be caught. Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."

海關十二月十二日透過風險評估，於機場查驗兩件從墨西哥到港，並報稱載有食物及糖果的空運貨物。經檢查後，海關人員於五枝石材保護劑塑膠樽內發現共約二十公斤懷疑液態冰毒。

跟進調查後，海關人員於昨日採取監控遞送行動，分別在元朗及尖沙咀拘捕兩名懷疑涉案女子，年齡分別為二十八歲和四十五歲。其後，海關於涉案女子位於尖沙咀處所進行搜查，再檢獲十粒懷疑大麻油煙彈、約四克懷疑大麻花、約三克懷疑可卡因以及約二百七十克懷疑霹靂可卡因。案件仍在調查中。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。此外，市民亦要避免將個人資料或地址交予他人以作收取包裹或貨物用途。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

海關提醒市民，切勿心存僥倖，鋌而走險。販運危險藥物屬嚴重刑事罪行，一經定罪，將對他們的前途造成嚴重影響。

Remarks by SHYA at media session regarding management of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po (with photo/video),2025-12-19 20:33,2025-12-19 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900799.htm,"âThe Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, met the media this afternoon (December 19) on the management of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Following are the remarks at the question-and-answer session:

Reporter: Could you detail in English to speak more about the reason for the Government to directly intervene and dismiss the Wang Fuk Court owner's corporation and also what are the factors being considered to appoint the Chinachem Group as a temporary manager? How long will this takeover last? What is the subsequent plan after that?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: As I just said, the Government has acted according to the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) section 31 to apply to the Lands Tribunal today to submit an application to dissolve the owners' corporation committee and to appoint Hop On Management Company Limited which is a subsidiary of Chinachem Group as the administrator to handle all the day to day operation of the management committee. This action will only help the owners of the Wang Fuk Court to handle various complicated legal procedures with expert assistance. Hop On Management Company has already stated that they will serve the Wang Fuk Court residents on a pro bono basis, and the Nina Wang Charity Trustees has agreed to contribute five million for professional costs or any procurement costs related to the management of Wang Fuk Court. We try to help the owners of Wang Fuk Court handle all the complicated legal procedures and accounting procedures with expert assistance.

Reporter: Could you please detail the roles of the existing owners’ corporation and the upcoming property manager? Does it include a fire safety? What will you do with the existing property manager? As at this point, do you think it is responsible for the fire safety?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: As I said, the Hop On Management Company will serve those Wang Fuk Court owners on a pro bono basis and provide them with professional property management services. This act will help the owners to get professional assistance when they decide how to execute or how to make a decision for Wang Fuk Court. The existing management committee and the property management company, as far as we know, the existing contract with the property management company will end by the end of this month. No matter whether they will extend the contract or not, we see that there will be a need for Wang Fuk Court owners to get professional assistance from a professional property management company. We think this is a way to help residents and owners of Wang Fuk Court.

​民政及青年事務局局長就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒談話內容（附圖／短片）,2025-12-19 20:32,2025-12-19 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900801.htm,"民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（十二月十九日）下午就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長︰各位好，政府今天引用了《建築物管理條例》（第344章）第31條，向土地審裁處提交申請，解散現有宏福苑業主立案法團（法團）的管理委員會（管委會），並委任華懋集團旗下的合安管理有限公司為委任管理人，以協助宏福苑業主處理火災後的各項管理及後續事宜。這是特區政府主動啓動此法律程序的首例。

大家都會同意，當前宏福苑的管理正面臨前所未有的挑戰，尤其在大型維修工程後續跟進、相關工程合約及法團維修帳目的處理、保險賠償、現有管理公司約滿後屋苑的管理及保安等複雜問題上，涉及多重技術、法律與財政考量，非一般法團管委會有能力處理。

政府深切體會宏福苑火災受影響居民正面對的巨大困難與不安，明白他們急需獲得適切支援，亦關注法團的現屆管委會是否有能力就各複雜的事宜保障他們的權益。在此艱難時刻，法團管委會成員既要處理自身家庭的各項需要，亦需嘗試協調和跟進剛才所述各項複雜事務，壓力沉重。加上受影響居民正陸續遷往位於不同地區的應急住所，單是接觸及協調各居民的工作亦絕非易事。近日，政府亦收到不少居民的意見，表示希望政府能協助接管法團的管理。

政府經審慎評估後，認為有必要回應居民訴求，因此決定主動介入，依法向土地審裁處提出申請，委任具豐富經驗的專業物業管理公司，即屬華懋集團旗下的合安管理有限公司作為臨時管理人，透過引入專業管理資源，做好屋苑在災後的管理跟進工作，保障所有業主的權益。該公司已明確表示，在此次委任中將不會收取任何行政費用。與此同時，龔如心慈善管理有限公司，即大家熟悉的龔如心慈善信託，亦表示如土地審裁處批出有關申請，會再捐出500萬元予法團支付因須聘用律師、會計師或其他專業服務的費用。簡單而言，臨時管理人的任命能減輕業主在這段期間的財政負擔。

更重要的是，管理人只是取代了法團管委會，代表業主立案法團處理屋苑的管理事務。法團作為依法成立的法人仍然存在，相關申請亦不會影響宏福苑業主對重要屋苑管理事務的最終決定權。具體而言，管理人在處理大型維修工程的後續跟進、相關工程合約、法團帳目管理等複雜問題時，會先尋求專業意見，進行詳細分析，並會向業主做好解説，所有最終決定仍會依照《建築物管理條例》的規定交由業主作投票通過。

如土地審裁處批准有關申請，民政事務總署將成立專班，聯同合安管理有限公司，密切跟進屋苑管理的各項工作，包括工程合約處理、跟進保險索賠、財務管理及居民支援等環節。合安管理有限公司除了每個月向政府提交報告，亦會每三個月向土地審裁處彙報其工作，確保管理過程透明、高效，並符合所有業主整體利益。我們承諾會繼續與居民同行，提供所需協助，共同克服難關。

記者：今次這個做法，為甚麼會選擇合安管理這間公司？有沒有任何招標或程序，如何挑選這間公司？這間公司會在宏福苑做多久，才完成這份合約，不再做委任人？還有作為業主的理解，是否說他們只是取代了原本法團的主席、副主席，可以做一些行政上的安排，他們還是依然需要出席會議去作決定？如果業主不決定的話，是否很多事情都不能夠繼續走下去呢？還有業主跟他們之後怎樣去對接呢？

民政及青年事務局局長︰這個決定，即引用《建築物管理條例》第31條去委任一個管理人時，這個委任管理人（administrator）將取代管委會的工作。每一個屋苑如果成立了一個法人團體，即業主立案法團，當業主立案法團做一些決定時，要根據《建築物管理條例》的要求，包括召開業主大會，或進行各樣招標，或做一些合約決定等，我們現在要做的是由這間合安管理有限公司取代管委會，即法團管委會的工作。即是說他會安排如何尋找專業意見，無論是法律意見等，去協助業主。在這個過程中，我們透過行使這條例賦予的權力去委任一個管理人時，並沒有取代業主立案法團的業主權力。即是說究竟這個法團的管委會以前和多少間公司簽了甚麼合約、或者保單條款是如何、銀行戶口剩餘多少錢、每一項基金是怎樣的，這些資料，我們透過委任管理人，若土地審裁處同意我們的申請，我們可以委任管理人時，管理人便可以得到這些資料，他亦可以聘請專業的律師或專業人士審視現在各項法律程序，然後為業主提供一些充分、全面的意見，讓他們可以根據《建築物管理條例》，若果他們要召開業主大會，需要做決定投票時，業主也能知道怎樣去投票。所以透過管理公司的工作，便可以讓業主得到專業意見，令他們更清楚法律程序。你剛才問他會做多久呢？因為接下來的程序可能是複雜的，所以現在沒有一個很特定的時間，我們向土地審裁處提交的申請，沒有一個特定的時間。但是我們都知道，我們是需要向土地審裁處，剛才亦提到，有關的委任管理人要每個月向政府提交報告，亦要每三個月向土地審裁處提交報告，讓大家知道工作是如何的。

至於委任管理人的選擇上，我們當然希望找到一些專業的、在這個行業服務時間長、能夠為宏福苑業主提供專業服務。合安管理有限公司是隸屬華懋集團，他們願意為業主無償提供服務。而且，龔如心慈善信託基金亦同意，如果土地審裁處同意我們的申請，委任合安管理有限公司作為委任管理人時，基金亦會捐出500萬元。這500萬元就是因為在整個過程中，日後很多可能需要處理法律或合約等過程中，我們可能需要聘請專業人士、專業服務，這500萬元就可以用來應付開支。所以這個工作是可以既幫助到業主，讓他們在這段時間，大家可以想像，宏福苑現在面對的情況，不是一個普通法團能夠處理到，因為問題的複雜性、規模之大，以及急迫性，很多居民都會有關於索償和法律要求等，所以不是一個普通一般的業主立案法團可以處理到。我們正正覺得需要委任管理人，協助業主去做這方面的工作。但是我們又明白，如果在這個時候，你叫業主怎樣再去調動他們的基金，來支付這些專業費用？所以得到龔如心慈善信託基金幫助他們。我們希望在這艱難時刻，面對一個不是一般普通法團能夠面對的情況下，可以為宏福苑業主提供一些專業的支援服務，而且是無償的，希望對於宏福苑的業主，對於日後處理各項合約或各項條文上會更好的。

記者：之前宏福苑現任和前任的業主立案法團成員都被廉署邀請調查，其實這次行動是否與兩任主席都被調查有關？另外，這次申請有否諮詢過宏福苑現任立案法團管委會的成員以及其他居民？如果有的話，他們有沒有表達希望政府接管的信息？謝謝。

民政及青年事務局局長：多謝你。首先，由宏福苑火災發生至今，政府都在不同階段提供適切的幫助。在最初的時候，我們一定是處理居民應急的、生活上的緊急需要。當我們處理緊急的生活需要後，下一步便是居民許多其他關於日後生活的安排，無論是長遠的住屋安排，或是一些法律程序等，所以政府為宏福苑業主提供不同階段性適切的幫助。現在我們引用《建築物管理條例》第31條作決定時，也考慮到現任法團管委會的成員未必能夠處理到現在宏福苑面對如此複雜和規模之大的問題。

另外，在過去一段時間，無論管委會能否成功召開會議，或是管委會成員出現的問題等，都令宏福苑業主非常關注。我們在過去這段時間也收到不同業主的查詢，究竟政府可以怎樣幫助他們，甚至有業主提出希望政府能夠接管法團。剛才我也解釋了，我們這次的行動不是接管法團，我們是接管法團的管委會。即是我們在這工作上絕對沒有剝奪業主的權力，反而是幫助他們更好地得到專業管理公司的幫助和專業的法律顧問服務，讓他們可以更好地行使權力，為宏福苑做一些更好的決定。我們日後的工作其實仍然是要跟從《建築物管理條例》不同的規定，包括如果要做決定時，要召開業主大會，並要為業主提供足夠的資訊等。

至於現屆的管委會，我們向土地審裁處申請時，審裁官會考慮邀請不同人士表達意見，所以會交由土地審裁處去進行相關程序。我們今日已向土地審裁處遞交申請，申請的原因是宏福苑正面對一個從未試過的、規模之大的複雜局面，一般的、普通的業主立案法團管委會成員應該不能處理，我們希望在這段時間，為宏福苑的業主提供專業服務，令業主能夠更好去處理日後一系列複雜的法律程序。我們也得到龔如心慈善信託基金和華懋集團同意，華懋集團的管理公司將提供無償服務，不需要動用到現屆管委會或法團現有的基金，亦可以得到一筆捐款，讓他們可以聘請到需要的專業服務。

反非法勞工行動拘四十三人（附圖）,2025-12-19 19:07,2025-12-19 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900727.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十二月十四日至昨日（十二月十八日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「銀翼行動」、「曙光行動」，聯同勞工處執行的「光影行動」及「彩虹行動」，聯同食物環境衞生署和康樂及文化事務署執行的「驚愕行動」，以及聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」。截至昨日，行動中共拘捕三十四名懷疑非法勞工、五名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及四名逾期逗留人士。

其中於「銀翼行動」中，調查人員搜查了十個目標地點，包括餐廳及洗衣工場，共拘捕十七名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為十男七女，年齡介乎二十一至四十九歲，除兩名人士為訪港旅客外，其餘十五名人士均為輸入勞工，涉嫌於非其合約指定的地點工作或擔任非合約指定的職位，從而違反逗留條件被捕。而涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩名男子，年齡為三十三及五十歲。

至於在聯同勞工處執行的「光影行動」中，調查人員共搜查了一百零二個目標地點，共拘捕三名懷疑從事外賣工作的非法勞工，均為非華裔男子，年齡介乎三十一至四十二歲，全部皆是免遣返聲請人士，持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。

於其他的反非法勞工行動中，調查人員針對不同行業搜查了多個目標地點，當中包括裝修中單位、皮具維修中心、物流貨倉以及餐廳食肆等，共拘捕十四名懷疑非法勞工、三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及四名逾期逗留人士。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為六男八女，年齡介乎二十二至六十二歲，當中一名女子涉嫌行使及管有懷疑偽造身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為三名女子，年齡分別介乎六十二至八十八歲。

就上述有關僱主涉嫌聘用非法勞工的個案，目前正在調查中。不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。另外，輸入勞工獲准以僱傭身分來港後，必須按『標準僱傭合約』所訂明直接受僱於合約中指定的同一僱主，並擔任合約中指定的職位及在指定的地點工作，而且不可受僱於其他公司或次承判商，亦不可轉換僱主、職位或工作地點（『標準僱傭合約』訂明的工作地點除外）。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆違反逗留條件者同罪。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

43 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-12-19 19:07,2025-12-19 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900730.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Silver Wing"" and ""Twilight"", joint operations with the Labour Department codenamed ""Lightshadow"" and ""Rainbow"", a joint operation with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department codenamed ""Flabbergast"", and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"" from December 14 to yesterday (December 18). A total of 34 suspected illegal workers, five suspected employers and four overstayers were arrested.

  During operation ""Silver Wing"", ImmD officers raided 10 target locations, including restaurants and a laundry factory. Seventeen suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised 10 men and seven women, aged 21 to 49. Among the arrestees, two were visitors, while the remaining 15 were imported workers who were suspected of breaching their conditions of stay by performing duties at a non-contractual workplace or by performing duties that were not stipulated in the contract. Two men, aged 33 and 50, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  During a joint operation with the Labour Department codenamed ""Lightshadow"", investigators raided 102 target locations, and a total of three suspected illegal workers were arrested for allegedly engaging in food delivery work. The three arrested suspected illegal workers are non-ethnic Chinese males, aged 31 to 42, who were non-refoulement claimants holding recognizance forms that prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong.

  During other anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers targeted different industries and raided multiple locations including renovation flats, a leather repair store, warehouses and restaurants etc. Fourteen suspected illegal workers, three suspected employers and four overstayers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised six men and eight women, aged 22 to 62. Among them, a woman was suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. Three Hong Kong female residents, aged 62 to 88, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  Investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Moreover, after entry into the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the imported worker admitted on an employment condition must remain under the direct employment of the same employer for the specified job and in the specific workplace(s) as stipulated in the Standard Employment Contract and cannot be employed by other companies or subcontractors. Change of the employer, post or place of work (unless stipulated in the Standard Employment Contract) is not permitted. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or an identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
CE meets Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam (with photo),2025-12-19 19:00,2025-12-19 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900687.htm,"The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, met with the visiting Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam, Mr Ho Duc Phoc, today (December 19) to exchange views on deepening co-operation between the two places. Also attending the meeting were the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong, and the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui.

Mr Lee welcomed Mr Ho and his delegation to Hong Kong. Mr Lee noted that Vietnam is Hong Kong's sixth-largest trading partner with close economic and trade relations. In the first three quarters of this year, bilateral merchandise trade reached US$ 49 billion, representing a significant increase of 67 per cent compared to the same period last year. Last year, Mr Lee led a high-level business delegation to Vietnam, during which the two sides signed 30 Memoranda of Understanding and agreements covering various areas including trade, investment, education, tourism, and finance. He expressed confidence that Hong Kong and Vietnam will continue to strengthen multifaceted co-operation and achieve mutual benefit.

Mr Lee highlighted that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has relaxed immigration arrangements for Vietnamese citizens visiting, working, or pursuing post-secondary studies in Hong Kong. In March this year, new measures were introduced to provide more convenient immigration arrangements for invited persons from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries, including Vietnam. These measures will further promote people-to-people exchanges and co-operation between Hong Kong and Vietnam in trade, professional services, and other sectors.

Noting that Hong Kong will actively play its role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" and fully leverage its unique advantages of connecting the Mainland and the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Mr Lee said Hong Kong will promote pragmatic co-operation with Vietnam in high value-added areas such as finance, innovation and technology, trade, and the green and digital economy."

李家超表示，特區政府已放寬越南公民來港探訪、就業及升讀大學的入境安排，並於今年三月推出新措施，為包括越南在內的東南亞國家聯盟國家受邀人士提供更便捷的入境安排，進一步促進香港和越南的人員往來，以及在經貿、專業服務及其他領域的交流合作。

李家超說，香港會積極擔當「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，全力發揮在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，推動與越南在金融、創新科技、貿易，以及綠色和數字經濟等高增值領域的務實合作。"

按《條例》獲得續期的地契，包括這批28個地段的地契，無須補地價，只須每年繳納相當於有關土地應課差餉租值百分之三的地租。涉及的28個地段包括八個位於九龍及20個位於香港島的地段。

地政總署透過上述「續期公告」宣布獲續期的地契，其原有產權負擔、權益及權利（例如按揭）將自動過渡至續期的年期而不受影響，業權人無須辦理任何手續，亦不需與政府簽立續期文件或重新辦理按揭。地政總署已向相關的業主或業主立案法團發信，通知他們有關續期的安排。

土地註冊處亦將自二○二六年一月起為已受「續期公告」涵蓋的適用地契的土地登記冊加入備註，以便公眾知悉其地契已獲續期。由於物業數目眾多（註），預計三份「續期公告」所涉地段的加註工作明年第二季完成。

Land leases extended under the Ordinance, including the leases of the 28 lots in this batch, do not require payment of additional premium but are subject to an annual payment of Government rent equivalent to 3 per cent of the rateable value of the relevant land. The 28 lots include eight located in Kowloon and 20 on Hong Kong Island.

Regarding the leases extended by the Lands Department through the above ""Extension Notice"", the encumbrances, interests and rights (such as mortgages) under the original lease will be carried forward to the extended lease term without being affected. Owners do not have to perform any procedures, nor are they required to execute lease extension documents with the Government or rearrange mortgages. The Lands Department has issued letters to the relevant owners or owners' corporations to inform them of the lease extension arrangements.

From January 2026 onwards, the Land Registry will add a remark in the respective land registers of applicable leases covered by the ""Extension Notices"" to enable the public to be informed of the extension of their leases. As a large number of properties are involved (Note), it is anticipated that the addition of remarks for the land lots involved in the three ""Extension Notices"" will be completed by the second quarter of next year.

A spokesperson for the Development Bureau said, ""The arrangement of extending land leases without having to execute a new contract under the Ordinance brings tremendous convenience to the public and businesses, effectively enhances the confidence of property owners and investors in the real estate market, and has received widespread support from various sectors of the community. The mechanism manifests the solid safeguards for the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong under the steadfast and successful implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle.""

The Ordinance, which came into effect on July 5, 2024, establishes a standing statutory mechanism for handling lease extension matters for applicable leases which do not contain a right of renewal and expire on or after the effective date in batches. Together with the ""Extension Notices"" published on July 5, 2024, and December 27, 2024, the Government has extended leases expiring from July 5, 2024, to the end of 2032. The Government will publish the next ""Extension Notice"" by the end of 2026 for handling lease extension for applicable leases expiring in 2033, in accordance with the requirement under the Ordinance to give six years' prior notice.

Note: The three Extension Notices cover a total of 407 lots, involving about 11 500 properties."
EIA report for Development at Ngau Tam Mei Area approved with conditions,2025-12-19 18:33,2025-12-19 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/19/P2025121900679.htm,"The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) announced, regarding the application submitted by the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) under the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance (EIAO), that the Director of Environmental Protection (DEP) yesterday (December 18) approved the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report for the Development at Ngau Tam Mei Area (the Project) with conditions.

The Project is a designated project (DP) under Schedule 3 of the EIAO (i.e. an urban development or redevelopment project covering an area of more than 50 hectares). It includes two DPs under Schedule 2 of the EIAO requiring an environmental permit for its construction and operation, including the new distributor roads and part of the revitalisation of the Ngau Tam Mei Drainage Channel (NTMDC) and river diversion works.

The CEDD has exhibited the EIA report for public inspection from October 6 to November 4, 2025, in accordance with the EIAO. During the public inspection period, the EPD received a total of seven public comments. The EIA Subcommittee of the Advisory Council on the Environment (ACE) discussed in detail the EIA report and the public comments at its meeting on December 5, 2025. Subsequently, the ACE unanimously recommended that the EPD approved the EIA report with conditions and recommendations at its meeting on December 11, 2025.

A spokesperson for the EPD said that the DEP considers that, through the implementation of mitigation measures recommended in the EIA report, the Project will bring multiple environmental benefits to the area. These include addressing the existing adverse environmental impacts caused by scattered and disorganised brownfield operations within the project area, thereby enhancing land-use efficiency and improving the overall environmental quality of the district. Furthermore, by widening and revitalising the NTMDC into a multifunctional blue-green spine, the ecological value and function of the project area and its surroundings can be enhanced. In addition, through wetland compensation connecting nearby isolated wetlands, the Project will increase the overall ecological value of the area.

The spokesperson stressed that the EPD has thoroughly considered the requirements of the EIA Study Brief and the Technical Memorandum on Environmental Impact Assessment Process, comments on the environment and ecological impacts raised by the public during the public inspection period of the EIA report, suggestions and data given by green groups in respect of the EIA report (including the State of Hong Kong Biodiversity 2025 published by the WWF-Hong Kong), and the response from the CEDD during the ACE meeting, as well as comments and recommended conditions raised by the ACE on approving the EIA report. The EPD decided to approve the EIA report with conditions.

The approval conditions mainly include requiring the CEDD to:

(i) submit a detailed Habitat Creation and Management Plan (HCMP) as recommended in the EIA report to the DEP for approval no later than three months before the commencement of construction of the Project, and consult the Agricultural, fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD);

(ii) submit an Implementation Plan for Ecological Enhancement Features Design (IPEEFD) for the NTMDC to the DEP for approval no later than three months before commencement of construction of the Project, and consult relevant government departments, including the AFCD, the Drainage Services Department, and the Planning Department;

(iii) set up an Environmental Committee to provide professional and stakeholders' advice on the preparation of HCMP and IPEEFD, and on the effectiveness of the ecological mitigation/enhancement measures as recommended in the EIA report and the two approved abovementioned plans; and
â
(iv) submit a Bird-Friendly Design Guideline for buildings and noise barriers within the Project area to the DEP for approval before commencement of construction of the Project.

In addition, the CEDD shall review the progress of the implementation of various plans, the environmental monitoring results, and the effectiveness of ecological mitigation/enhancement measures. The EPD will continue to closely liaise with relevant government departments to follow up on the abovementioned approval conditions.

The approved EIA report and the approval conditions have been uploaded to the EPD's EIAO website (www.epd.gov.hk/eia). Members of the public may also visit the EIAO Register Office at 27th floor, Southorn Centre, Wan Chai, to inspect these documents."
