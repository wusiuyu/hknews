十月份第三批涵蓋九個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及兩個監察地區分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共三批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共23個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這23個監察區中，15個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有八區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
按揭證券公司發行第三批基建貸款抵押證券,2025-10-17 17:00,2025-10-17 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700487.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港按揭證券有限公司（按揭證券公司）今日（十月十七日）宣布成功發行第三批基建貸款抵押證券。這次發行是通過特設公司Bauhinia ILBS 3 Limited（Bauhinia 3）進行。按揭證券公司於二○二三年和二○二四年成功發行基建貸款抵押證券後，繼續致力透過定期發行以發展這一資產類別。Bauhinia系列證券的發行為專業投資者提供一個投資橫跨不同地域和行業的多元化項目和基建貸款機會。

按揭證券公司執行董事兼總裁鮑克運表示：「再次成功發行彰顯了按揭證券公司對基建貸款抵押證券的持續投入，以及對香港發展為基建融資中心的支持。新增和現有投資者持續的強勁需求，顯示他們對此資產類別的興趣日漸增加，並對其帶來的好處和多樣化更加認可。」

Bauhinia 3的發行再次獲得投資者的踴躍反應，包括新增和現有投資者，而亞洲以外的投資者需求增加。擴大後的投資者基礎非常多元化，涵蓋資產管理公司、企業、家族辦公室、金融機構、保險公司、私人銀行及證券公司。

HKMC's third infrastructure loan-backed securities issuance,2025-10-17 17:00,2025-10-17 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700485.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

âThe Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) announced today (October 17) the successful completion of its third infrastructure loan-backed securities (ILBS) issuance. This is executed through a Hong Kong special purpose vehicle (SPV), Bauhinia ILBS 3 Limited (Bauhinia 3) and it builds on the HKMC's aim of developing the ILBS asset class through regular issuances after successful issuances in 2024 and 2023. The Bauhinia issuances offer professional investors exposure to a diversified portfolio of project and infrastructure debt across multiple geographies and sectors.

  The Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of the HKMC, Mr Colin Pou,said, ""It is another successful issuance demonstrating the HKMC's continued commitment to ILBS and the support for the development of Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing hub. The ongoing strong demand from new and existing investors shows that investor interest continues to grow and they increasingly recognise the benefits and diversification this asset class brings.""

The Bauhinia 3 issuance received another strong response from investors, both from new and repeated investors, with growing demand from investors outside Asia. The expanded investor base is well diversified, including asset manager, corporate, family office, financial institution, insurer, private banking, and security firm investors.

Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) continued to support the HKMC's ILBS issuance as an anchor investor through its US$300 million investment programme. AIIB's investment programme continues to fulfil its objective to mobilise private capital into the infrastructure sector.

Bauhinia 3 has a portfolio of 33 project and infrastructure loans across 28 individual projects spreading across 12 countries and 9 sub-sectors, with a total value of approximately US$450.5 million. In total, five classes of notes are issued (Class A1-SU, Class A1, Class B, Class C and Class D), with aggregate principal of US$427.9 million. The issued notes are listed on The Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The quality of the portfolio and increasing investor interest in ILBS allowed the HKMC to issue Class D at non-investment grade, the first of its kind in Asia, which further enhanced the efficiency of the capital structure. The HKMC acts as the sponsor, collateral manager and risk retention holder of the transaction.

Within the capital structure of Bauhinia 3, there is an US$117 million sustainability tranche (Class A1-SU) backed by sustainable, green and social assets. Class A1-SU is issued in accordance with the HKMC's Social, Green and Sustainability Financing Framework, which aligns with the Green Bond Principles, Social Bond Principles and Sustainability Bond Guidelines released by the International Capital Market Association.

Standard Chartered Bank is the Sole Global Co-ordinator. BNP Paribas, China International Capital Corporation Hong Kong Securities Limited, ING Bank N.V., Singapore Branch, MUFG Securities Asia Limited and Standard Chartered Bank are the Joint Bookrunners. Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited is the Co-Manager."
FEHD releases third batch of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October,2025-10-17 17:00,2025-10-17 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700364.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (October 17) released the third batch of gravidtrap indexes and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in October, covering 11 survey areas, as follows:

Among the third batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas in October, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released three batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 23 survey areas. Among these 23 survey areas, 15 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Eight other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#).

​23名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-10-17 16:45,2025-10-17 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700541.htm,"23名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於十月十日及今日（十月十七日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款介乎800元至8,800元，合計罰款共72,600元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 262宗個案，而就法庭已處理的913宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及793名分間單位業主，合計總罰款共2,436,710元，另有349宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該23名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；及（二）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

如就規管租賃事宜有疑問，可致電電話熱線（2150 8303）或瀏覽估價署網頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/our_services/part_iva.html）內的相關資訊。"

Deputy Commissioner Li (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Li Yongsheng), Consuls-General, Chamber representatives, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. A very warm welcome to the Hong Kong Museum of History.

  Thank you for joining this special tour of the ""United in Arms, Standing for Peace"" exhibition.

  Today, you are not just attending an exhibition. You are looking at a pivotal chapter in the history of China and the world.

  The war began in 1931. For 14 long years, the Chinese nation fought with great courage and a strong will to protect the homeland. The cost was immense. Millions of lives were lost.

  The exhibition shows this history through more than 180 exhibits. Eighty-two of them are from the National Museum of China. About 60 items are being shown for the first time. Eight of these are top-level national treasures.

  Each item tells a story of struggle and sacrifice. They also show Hong Kong’s role in supporting the national effort.

  The exhibition is about education and remembrance. We must never forget the sacrifices made. We remember the past not to keep hatred alive, but to cherish the peace we have today. We remember to learn from history and to build a better, brighter future for all.

  The exhibition, which runs until mid-December, is a team effort. It is jointly organised by our Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Hong Kong Museum of History, and the National Museum of China. We also thank the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust and the Bank of China (Hong Kong) for their generous support.

  The exhibition is just one part of our effort. We are also organising a variety of related events and activities, including visits to war sites, seminars, thematic lectures, film screenings, book fairs and photo exhibitions across Hong Kong. The goal is to help the public understand the spirit of unity and resilience of the Chinese people in the fight for peace.

  As announced in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, we are repairing war sites in every district with a view to integrating them into tourism routes and educational activities.

  We will also collaborate with Shenzhen to promote a new red educational route, under the theme of ""Chinese Cultural Celebrity Rescue"" history, to enhance understanding among people of Hong Kong and tourists of the history of the War of Resistance in Hong Kong.

  Ladies and gentlemen, this exhibition shows the great horrors of war. But it is presented in the name of peace.

  Thank you."
23 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-10-17 16:45,2025-10-17 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700542.htm,"  Twenty-three landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $800 and $8,800, amounting to a total of $72,600, on October 10 and today (October 17) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 262 cases to date. Among the 913 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 793 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,436,710. In addition, 349 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 23 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon a comprehensive investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to enable SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions.

CHP announces two new melioidosis cases,2025-10-17 16:30,2025-10-17 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700522.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 17) announced that two new melioidosis cases were recorded in the past week (October 10 to 16). The CHP appealed to members of the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent melioidosis. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

The first case involves a 44-year-old male with good past health who lives in Yuen Long. He sustained an injury to his right knee on September 19. He has presented with a fever, and pain and discharge from the wound on his right knee since September 26. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Tin Shui Wai Hospital for treatment on October 6. The clinical diagnosis was a wound infection. He did not require hospitalisation.

The second case involves a 66-year-old male with underlying illness who lives in Kwai Tsing. He presented with a fever, malaise and syncope since October 10. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital on the next day (October 11) and was admitted for treatment. The clinical diagnosis was sepsis.

Both patients are in stable condition. Their clinical samples were confirmed to be positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei upon testing. The CHP is investigating the infection sources of the cases. Initial epidemiological investigations revealed that these two cases are sporadic. No epidemiological linkages have been established between them and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of yesterday (October 16), 18 melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.


âThe CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. For more information on melioidosis, please visit the website of the CHP atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html."
衞生防護中心公布新增兩宗類鼻疽個案,2025-10-17 16:30,2025-10-17 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700521.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月十七日）表示，過去一星期（十月十日至十六日）錄得兩宗新增類鼻疽個案。中心呼籲市民保持個人及環境衞生以預防類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

首宗個案涉及一名過往健康良好的44歲男子，他居於元朗區。他於九月十九日弄傷右膝，九月二十六日起出現發燒、右膝傷口疼痛及傷口位置出現分泌物，十月六日到天水圍醫院急症室求診，無需入院。他的臨床診斷為傷口感染。

第二宗個案涉及一名有長期病患的66歲男子，他居於葵青區。他自十月十日出現發燒、全身乏力及昏厥，翌日（十月十一日）到伊利沙伯醫院急症室求診，需留院治理。他的臨床診斷為敗血症。

兩名患者目前況穩定，他們的臨床樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。中心正調查個案的感染源頭，初步流行病學調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這兩宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至昨日（十月十六日），本港今年錄得18宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"

  Compared with the grading released last week, Anglers' Beach has been upgraded from Grade 3 to Grade 2. Butterfly Beach and Cafeteria Old Beach have been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

Speech by SCED at Hong Kong Fintech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 (English only),2025-10-17 15:35,2025-10-17 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700507.htm," Following is the speech by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, at the press conference on Hong Kong Fintech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 today (October 17):

 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today.

 The StartmeupHK is an initiative which aims at helping founders of innovative and scalable start-ups from outside Hong Kong to set up or expand here. Through this initiative, Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) offers information about our start-up ecosystem, connects people to the start-up community, and fosters a positive environment for start-ups to thrive.

 Start-ups are an important part of any economy. Behind every start-up, there must be an innovative business idea. These new ideas call for changes and refresh our economy. And Hong Kong is just the right place not only for start-ups to be created, but also for them to grow and scale. Apart from the favourable business environment in Hong Kong, the start-ups here are supported by a strong network of incubators and accelerators, a pool of experienced angels and venture capitalists, a host of government-backed programmes and a welcoming business community.

 Attracting and grooming start-ups are an important aspect of InvestHK's work. And it has done a great job. The number of start-ups in Hong Kong has nearly tripled, from about 1 600 start-ups 10 years ago to around 4 700 last year. The impressive expansion is a result of the pro-startup measures taken by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government over the years.

 While it is common for start-ups to be set up by local people, it is worth noting that 28 per cent of the founders of our start-ups are from outside Hong Kong. This is obviously a testament to Hong Kong's appeal as Asia Pacific's top destination for start-up investment and a start-up talent magnet. Going forward, we will continue to focus on assisting high potential unicorns and scale-ups worldwide across various sectors to grow.

 This year, the StartmeupHK initiative has evolved by collaborating with Hong Kong FinTech Week, under the theme ""Curating the New Fintech Era"". Building on the success in the past, the 2025 edition highlights the growing convergence of fintech with other frontier technologies - artificial intelligence (AI), greentech, healthtech, and Web3 - which are increasingly deployed as part of comprehensive tech start-up solutions. The Festival offers a unique opportunity to engage with the fintech ecosystem and reinforces Hong Kong's position as a hub for scalable start-ups and cross-border innovation.

 To bring this theme to life, we will expand the main conference from eight to 11 fora, introducing new sessions like ""Healthtech & Insurtech"" and the ""ChinaâGlobal Innovation Forum"". We will also cover wider cross-sector themes such as ""Blockchain & Web3"" and ""Digital Finance"". These fora will address important global issues including asset tokenisation, responsible AI, and the growing convergence of healthtech and insurtech. Besides, there will be a new ""TechX Forum"" to explore how emerging technologies are moving from experimentation to large-scale deployment. These additions encourage earlier practical conversations between founders, regulators, and corporates, helping start-ups move faster from pilot projects to full production.

 InvestHK's Global Fast Track 2025 programme has also grown to include seven verticals, adding ""Innovation & Technology"" to expand beyond fintech. This reflects the increasing overlap of technology across multiple industries. The year-long hybrid programme provides participants with one-on-one meetings, live pitching opportunities, mentorship, and tailored business matching with corporate clients, investors and service providers. I strongly recommend that the global start-up community joins this programme to assist your start-ups in scaling up by leveraging Hong Kong's advantages.

 Looking ahead, with the StartmeupHK Festival at the heart of this partnership, we are not just celebrating success - together, we are shaping Hong Kong's future of innovation.

 We look forward to welcoming the global start-up community to join us this November. Please come to Hong Kong to connect, to build and to scale. I am sure that you will always find unlimited business opportunities in our city, your ideal destination for business and investment.

 Thank you."

Ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. It is with immense pleasure that I unveil the details of this year's highly anticipated Hong Kong FinTech Week 2025.

 This year marks a historic milestone - the 10th anniversary of the event. I have been privileged to witness the tremendous growth and evolution of this event in the past years. This remarkable year is graced with new records. We are welcoming over 37 000 executives, more than 800 renowned speakers, and 700 exhibitors from over 100 economies to celebrate with us.

 This powerhouse event, together with the StartmeupHK Festival, will demonstrate how Hong Kong is leveraging technological convergence to elevate the economic impact of fintech and innovation on a global scale.

 Hong Kong's credentials as a fintech leader are not just claims - they are hard, global facts. Consistently ranked among the world's top three international financial centres and as a leader in Asia, Hong Kong has taken bold strides to solidify its position as a leader in fintech as well.

 Today, Hong Kong's fintech hub is ranked number one globally under the latest Global Financial Centers Index. Our city is home to more than 1 100 fintech firms, and the fintech sector is projected to reach US$606 billion in total revenue by 2032, with an impressive annual growth rate of 28.5 per cent.

 In the first half of this year, Hong Kong was also ranked first globally in terms of the amount of funds raised through IPOs (initial public offerings), with many advanced technology companies listing on our exchange.

 FinTech Week this year carries the theme ""Curating the New Fintech Era"". It is indeed our promise: Hong Kong will not just adapt to the future of fintech. We will lead, we will build and continue to stay at the forefront of it.

 None of this success happens by accident. It comes from sustained policy vision, unwavering public-private collaboration, and a commitment to balancing innovation with security. Let me highlight the milestones we have achieved over the past year.

 On digital assets, our Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong issued in June this year sets out our vision for a trusted and innovative ecosystem that prioritises risk management and investor protection. We also implemented the Stablecoins Ordinance in August to establish a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers, on top of our existing regulatory framework for virtual asset trading platforms that commenced in June two years ago.

 On AI (artificial intelligence), we issued a policy statement on responsible adoption of AI in the financial market last October, and have launched two cohorts of GenA.I. Sandbox to assist banks in exploring generative AI's capabilities in enhancing risk management, anti-fraud measures and customer experience.

 On e-payment, we launched Payment Connect with the People's Bank of China in June this year to implement the linkage of the Internet Banking Payment System on the Mainland and the Faster Payment System, with a view to supporting secure, efficient and also convenient real-time cross-boundary payments.

 We also continue to enhance the financial infrastructure, such as the Commercial Data Interchange, and the Central Bank Digital Currency, to explore integrating fintech with the real economy.

 Each of these initiatives reflects the collaboration among the Government, financial regulators and industry players. We turn ideas into action, and at the same time action into global leadership.

 Looking ahead, we are doubling down on this momentum with a clear, forward-focused strategy. As highlighted in the latest Policy Address, we will leverage the ongoing asset reallocation wave by global investors to consolidate our status as an international financial centre. We will drive fintech development and promote green and sustainable finance to capitalise on these new growth opportunities. This is not just about maintaining our lead; it is about shaping the next chapter of global finance, where capital flows more intelligently and technology addresses real-world economic challenges.

 This year Hong Kong FinTech Week will serve this purpose. It will bring together global finance and tech leaders, policymakers, and investors to collaborate, and curate the new fintech era.

 So I invite each of you, every one of you here today to join us. Let's explore the boundless possibilities of fintech. Let us pave the way for a connected, efficient, and sustainable global economy. Thank you."

  Under the prevailing arrangements, business operators affected by government development projects will be offered statutory compensation in accordance with the law, or ex-gratia allowances as an alternative, subject to the fulfilment of relevant eligibility criteria.

  A spokesperson for the LandsD said that in order to facilitate brownfield operators' relocation of businesses or operations, and to optimise the utilisation of land resources, the department has been identifying suitable vacant sites on government land to let through tender by way of a short-term tenancy.

  The four sites to be let through tender are suitable for a range of uses including industrial use, open storage, godown, workshop, recovery and recycling or reprocessing business and fee-paying public carpark.

  The spokesperson stressed that the LandsD will continue to identify vacant sites suitable for use by those brownfield operators required to be displaced, and these sites will be let through tender by way of a short-term tenancy."

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，切勿攜帶受管制物品進出香港。

The total estimated market value was about $950,000. The passenger concerned was convicted and sentenced to four months' imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (October 17) for contravening the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) (Cap. 60). All the pharmaceutical products were confiscated.

Customs officers intercepted a 43-year-old male passenger on September 10 at the Arrival Hall at HKIA for Customs clearance. Upon examination, the batch of pharmaceutical injections, pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical ointment was found inside his check-in suitcases and personal baggage.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds the public not to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong.

Under the IEO, any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Prior to his departure from New York, Mr Chan gave an interview to the financial media outlet Bloomberg and met with the Global Head of External Relations at Bloomberg LP, Mr Kevin Sheekey, during which they exchanged views on global economic prospects and developments in the financial markets.

  Upon his arrival in Washington, Mr Chan held meetings with senior officials of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG). He met with the IMF team responsible for conducting the Article IV Consultation on Hong Kong, during which he provided a detailed account of Hong Kong’s current economic and fiscal conditions, as well as its development directions. Both sides also exchanged views on the outlook for the global economy and financial system.

  Then, Mr Chan paid a courtesy call on the Managing Director and Chief Administrative Officer of the WBG, Mr Zhang Wencai. They discussed opportunities for enhancing co-operation and exchanged views on regional development issues.

  In the evening, Mr Chan attended a roundtable dinner hosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Washington. At the event, he briefed representatives from major United States (US) business chambers, think tanks and consultancy firms etc. on Hong Kong’s business environment and latest developments, and engaged in discussions on the future of Hong Kong–US economic and trade relations.

  Mr Chan will attend the Annual Meetings of the IMF and WBG in Washington today (October 17, Washington time).

Note: The Article IV Consultation is a regular economic assessment conducted by the IMF pursuant to Article IV of its Articles of Agreement. It entails a comprehensive analysis of a member’s macroeconomic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies, financial stability and structural reforms. A report will be published subsequent to the analysis. In its report published earlier this year, the IMF reaffirmed Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and recognised the resilience of its financial system, underpinned by a robust institutional framework, ample policy buffers, and the smooth functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System."

  Then, Mr Chan paid a courtesy call on the Managing Director and Chief Administrative Officer of the WBG, Mr Zhang Wencai. They discussed opportunities for enhancing co-operation and exchanged views on regional development issues.

  In the evening, Mr Chan attended a roundtable dinner hosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Washington. At the event, he briefed representatives from major United States (US) business chambers, think tanks and consultancy firms etc. on Hong Kong’s business environment and latest developments, and engaged in discussions on the future of Hong Kong–US economic and trade relations.

  Mr Chan will attend the Annual Meetings of the IMF and WBG in Washington today (October 17, Washington time).

Note: The Article IV Consultation is a regular economic assessment conducted by the IMF pursuant to Article IV of its Articles of Agreement. It entails a comprehensive analysis of a member’s macroeconomic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies, financial stability and structural reforms. A report will be published subsequent to the analysis. In its report published earlier this year, the IMF reaffirmed Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and recognised the resilience of its financial system, underpinned by a robust institutional framework, ample policy buffers, and the smooth functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System."
​運輸及物流局局長在立法會交通事務委員會就「粵車南下」開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-17 12:00,2025-10-17 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700310.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十月十七日）在立法會交通事務委員會就「粵車南下」的開場發言全文：

主席：

特區政府和廣東省政府一直致力推動各項跨境通行政策，尤其我們希望用好港珠澳大橋，促進粵港澳大灣區的互聯互通。「粵車南下」作為「港車北上」的互惠安排，更便利粵港兩地居民雙向奔赴，由人文交流所帶來的協同效應，能為粵港兩地經濟、社會發展、旅遊發展，以至大灣區融合發展注入更大動能，進一步強化香港內聯外通，也是加強粵港合作的重要體現。

粵港雙方已於今年七月公布「粵車南下」政策，二○二五年《施政報告》附篇亦已述明，粵港正全力推進，讓符合條件的粵車可以一方面經大橋前往香港口岸人工島上的自動化停車場泊車後，司機和乘客經香港國際機場轉乘飛機，或入境轉乘香港四通八達的公共交通工具；或第二方面，在無須取得常規配額下以自駕方式經大橋直接入境並暢遊香港各市區部分。

我們將透過四大策略，包括確保安全、有效分流、設有完備配套和能提出簡便申請，穩步推行「粵車南下」。近月，我們在準備工作上也取得積極進展，今日亦想趁此機會在委員會向大家匯報和聽取意見。首先，在確保安全方面，我們將透過多渠道向內地申請人發放「懶人包」以及不同主題的簡短影片，以深入淺出的方式介紹香港道路和駕駛安全資料。而入境市區的粵車更須按香港的要求進行驗車，為此，運輸署正委託香港機構在廣東方便的地點設立驗車中心，安排車輛檢驗。

第二，在有效分流方面，口岸停車場會先啓用轉機停車場，提供約1 800個泊車位，設24小時自動化停車及送機和接機服務。今日有香港機場管理局的同事在埸，稍後可就這方面的籌備工作回應議員的提問。入境市區部分則會採取穩健可控方針，以小規模每日100個預約名額開始，預備每輛粵車留港最多三日。我們會視乎推行情況、用家和市民適應程度，以及配套設施的使用狀況等，日後與粵方持續檢視和商討有序增加每日出行名額。我們亦會透過不同渠道發放「粵車南下」的旅遊泊車指南，引導旅客至全港各區的文化、體育、旅遊、展覧與購物消閒的地方，介紹附近具備泊車位的地點。我們亦鼓勵旅客來港後，可泊車轉乘四通八達、極具香港特色且近日廣受旅客歡迎的公共交通工具，穿梭香港的街道到不同地點，以至在維港兩岸景色環繞下遊走港九兩岸，同時亦可體驗我們的服務效率與歷史韻味並重的公共交通所編織出的公交風景線，從而盡量疏導並分流，避免粵車過分聚集於個別地點。指南內的建議行程會按經驗和景點的轉變而陸續增加，包括文化、旅遊、展覽的景點，或如何透過停車場或酒店設施附近能在泊車後轉乘其他公共交通工具的方法，盡量善用我們現有的高效公共交通系統，帶出一些新的旅遊體驗，當然最重要的是希望吸引他們留港消費和過夜，亦希望「粵車南下」有此吸引力。

第三，我們需要做好完備配套，一直鼓勵主要發展商和私人停車場營運商商討盡快提升其轄下停車場的泊車配套。就泊車位，過去大家在議會亦有表達關注，我們需要繼續努力。為迎接粵車來港，我們需要特別做好三方面的支援。第一，停車場可支援以內地支付工具繳費；第二，提供國標充電裝置；第三，提供免接觸入閘設備，因為有些車輛是左軚，但本港車輛是右軚，隨着現時的設備和科技先進，可用免接觸式的方法以方便車輛入閘。同時，我們正在口岸停車場和大嶼山鄰近大橋口岸位置增設同時符合國標和歐標的快速充電設施。業界反應正面，現正加緊努力。

第四，為接受內地居民、在廣東領牌的合資格人士申請，粵港雙方會在驗車、牌證申請和保險安排方面推出措施，便利粵車遵從有關要求。在申請資格方面，根據廣東省交通運輸廳就「粵車南下」管理辦法徵求意見稿中列明，申請人需是持有有效中國居民身份證的內地居民，而車輛需要在廣東登記，並是領取有效牌證的非營運私家車，不超過八個座位，包括駕駛者座位，而指定駕駛者需持有香港正式駕駛執照。就車輛和人方面，也是根據「港車北上」的申請要求，每名申請人士可就其私家車指定不多於兩名司機，其中一名司機是申請人，駕駛往來香港和廣東省，做到綁定司機的安排。我們與廣東商討「粵車南下」的申請細節時，亦會涵蓋類似的安排，而粵港相關的交通和執法部門亦會繼續商討，確保因應此安排便利日後執法，以及作妥善操作的安排。

預期「粵車南下」將讓嶄新客群包括消費力更高的個人和家庭，自駕來港數日旅遊、經商、出席展覽或會議、使用專業服務和休閒飲食。

「粵車南下」的各項準備工作已經進入最後階段，待與粵方進一步確定細節後，我們將適時公布詳情，爭取於今年十一月實施。就車輛停泊在機場口岸停車場及入境這兩部分，我們爭取在十一月內接受申請。我們亦預期機場口岸停車場可在十一月內開始接受預訂及啓用。至於粵車入境市區，我們希望在今年年底內可有有相關車輛訪港。「粵車南下」整個申請流程、演練正陸續進行，令安排有序執行。

正如剛才所說，我們正聯絡業界把握機遇，為新客群提供消費、泊車和住宿優惠，帶動旅客至各區的景點和住宿設施，酒店等業界已表示支持。我希望透過今日的會議，多聽議員意見，讓我們有更多想法以細化工作。接着，希望借助業界及社會各界助力為「粵車南下」營造正面氛圍。

最後，一條大橋可便利雙向奔赴、帶動百業受惠，從而締造無限機遇。我們有信心「粵車南下」將有序推展，達致用家歡迎、市民安心、社會獲益多方共贏的效果。多謝主席，我們非常樂意聽取議員的意見及提問。"

尊敬的成林常委（北京市委常委、組織部部長李成林）、尊敬的唐永剛局長（中央組織部人才工作局局長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

今天我很榮幸可以代表香港特別行政區來到北京參與2025高水平人才高地建設論壇。在此，我代表香港特別行政區政府熱烈祝賀論壇取得圓滿成功。

人才已成為最稀缺、全球競逐的最重要資源，誰搶得、留下最好的人才，就可以奠定未來發展的最好的基礎。今天，北京舉辦2025高水平人才高地建設論壇，就是向全世界展示北京的魅力、北京雄厚的實力，在全球人才戰當中顯示北京獨特的優勢。

香港作為國家對外的窗口，作為「一國兩制」實踐的最重要土地，也肩負着打造國際高端人才集聚高地的任務。在本屆政府李家超特首的帶領下，我們本着用好「一國兩制」的優勢，發揮香港作為全國唯一城市以普通法為法律基礎、作為全球三大金融中心之一、有效連接法治資金制度的優勢，致力面向全球，提供制度的創新、政策的支援；而且也通過一系列的行動，讓全球的人才都聚到香港，為香港的經濟作貢獻，為香港的科技發展作貢獻，更要為國家的科技發展、經濟發展作出貢獻。

香港的優勢，是「一國兩制」、與世界規則對接的優勢、教育資源的優勢，是歐美和海外的專家學者要落地中國這塊土地的時候，最方便、最容易落降的一個平台。不管是對他們的孩子、對他們創業的需要，香港都是最方便的試板。通過香港，我們可以將人才共享共用。事實上，過去香港在人才的工作也得到了世界的認可。在剛剛發布的《2025年世界人才排名》當中，香港從去年的第九位，上升到今年的全球第四位，名列亞洲第一。此外，在創新集群方面，「深圳—香港—廣州」在今年排名世界第一 。所以能看到，不管是我們的人才政策、創科政策，都好好的發揮香港「一國兩制」的優勢，為國家作出香港獨特的貢獻。

特區政府非常重視教育、科技、人才一體化的發展，已經成立了由政務司司長領導的教育、科技和人才委員會，全力在政策、資源、支援方面為人才到港發展提供全面的協助，更好地發揮香港的優勢。此外我們在創科方面也提出了三項百億元的計劃，希望通過香港政策資源的投入，帶動私營資金一起投放，讓香港成為金融以外的另一個創科的樂土。

在此，我期待香港與北京可以更好的聯動，發揮好香港「一國兩制」的優勢，用好北京首都圈無與倫比的優勢，做到一加一大於二的效果。在此我預祝論壇取得圓滿成功，謝謝大家。"

"Ombudsman probes Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department's arrangements for handling dog licence applications and renewals (with photos)",2025-10-17 11:00,2025-10-17 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101600697.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (October 17) announced the launch of a full investigation into the procedures and mechanisms currently employed by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) in handling dog licence applications and renewals.

The Rabies Regulations require all dogs in Hong Kong reaching the age of 5 months or above to be licensed, vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. The AFCD's Animal Management Centres provide anti-rabies dog inoculation and licensing and microchipping services.

The Office of The Ombudsman received a public complaint that the complainant recently brought his microchipped dogs to an AFCD Animal Management Centre to apply for their first dog licences. Upon arrival, he was informed that the AFCD had introduced a new requirement whereby dog owners must provide proof of the legal origin of their dogs, such as a receipt for purchasing the dog from a pet shop or the dog's vaccination record, in order to apply for a dog licence. Eventually, the complainant had to return home with his dogs to obtain the required proof and revisited the centre to complete the procedure. The complainant alleged that the AFCD was unable to reasonably explain the rationale for the new requirement, and there was a lack of information about the new requirement on its website.

Mr Chan said, ""Keeping pet dogs is increasingly common in Hong Kong. The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address also includes measures to promote a pet-friendly culture. Our society is gradually embracing pet inclusivity. It is crucial for the AFCD to establish reasonable procedures and requirements for dog licence applications and renewals and to provide clear information to the public so as to facilitate dog owners in licensing, vaccinating and microchipping their dogs, as well as renewing dog licences and re-vaccinating their dogs in a timely manner. These measures are essential for preventing the outbreak of rabies and effectively monitoring whether dog owners have fulfilled their responsibilities, thereby protecting the rights and welfare of dogs. In this light, I have decided to launch a full investigation into the AFCD's mechanisms and procedures for handling dog licence applications and renewals to identify any areas for improvement. Pertinent recommendations will be made for enhancing the AFCD's services, with a view to facilitating dog owners in taking proper care of their dogs.""

The Ombudsman welcomes views from members of the public on this topic. Written submissions should reach the Office of The Ombudsman by November 17, 2025:

​申訴專員全面調查漁農自然護理署處理狗隻新領及續領牌照的安排（附圖）,2025-10-17 11:00,2025-10-17 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101600689.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（十月十七日）宣布展開全面調查，詳細審研現時漁農自然護理署（漁護署）處理為狗隻新領及續領牌照的程序和機制。

《狂犬病規例》規定，在本港超過五個月大的狗隻都必須領有牌照、接種狂犬病疫苗和植入晶片。漁護署轄下各區動物管理中心提供為狗隻注射預防狂犬病疫苗及簽發牌照和植入晶片的服務。

申訴專員公署接獲市民的申訴，指他最近帶同已植入晶片的狗隻到漁護署的動物管理中心為該狗隻新領牌照時，才得悉漁護署加入了新要求，狗主必須出示狗隻的合法來源證明（例如從寵物店購買狗隻的收據或狗隻的防疫注射記錄），才能為狗隻申領牌照。申訴人最終須帶同狗隻回家取回證明，再返回中心以完成手續。申訴人指漁護署未能為加入該項新要求作合理的解說，又指當時該署的網頁沒有提及該要求。

陳積志表示：「飼養狗隻作寵物在香港越趨普遍，《行政長官2025年施政報告》也包括推廣寵物友善場景的措施。社會逐漸傾向人寵共融，漁護署為申請狗隻牌照訂立的程序和要求必須合理，向市民提供的資訊亦必須清晰，方便狗主適時為狗隻領牌、接種疫苗及植入晶片，以及為狗隻續牌及再次接種疫苗，這對於防止狂犬病爆發及有效監察狗主履行責任，以維護狗隻權益和福利至為重要。因此，我決定展開這項全面調查，詳細審研現時漁護署處理狗主為狗隻新領及續領牌照的機制和程序，以及探討當中有否改善空間，提出適切改善建議，優化漁護署服務以便狗主妥善照顧其狗隻。」

委員支持政府持續有序造地，提供穩定土地供應以滿足香港的經濟及社會需要，以及政府提出的創新措施，回應市場情況及業界與專業團體的意見及需要。主要措施包括：

（一）持續有序造地：未來十年熟地預測完成量將達到約2600公頃，當中約七成來自北部都會區，而今個財政年度產出約150公頃的熟地的目標，預計可以達到。政府亦會繼續推進各個造地項目，包括龍鼓灘、將軍澳第137區和第132區，以及東涌新市鎮擴展。

（二）加快發展北部都會區：設立一個新的高層次決策架構，即由行政長官領導的北都發展委員會，以及下設的三個工作組：發展及營運模式設計組、大學城籌劃及建設組，以及規劃及發展工作組。其他旨在加快北部都會區發展的主要措施包括訂立專屬法例以簡化法定程序，成立法定園區公司及專項撥款渠道，以及加快審批及收地與賠償。政府亦會透過採用分階段的發展模式、靈活計算地價及批出租約的安排等，精簡行政程序及拆牆鬆綁，以及促進投資和公私營合作。上述部分措施亦適用於整個香港。

（三）助力產業發展：政府會推行一系列措施以推動產業發展，包括「城中學舍計劃」，促進市場增加學生宿舍供應，鞏固香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位；推動遊艇泊位建設項目，以配合發展遊艇經濟；豐富鄉郊生態遊體驗；及分階段統籌美化蘭桂坊和附近街道的相關工作。

（四）市區更新及釋放市區工業用地：為加速市區更新以應對樓宇老化問題，政府以新思維提出三項措施，即預留北部都會區內新發展區的三幅土地予市區重建局興建新的樓換樓計劃下的新單位；放寬地積比率轉移安排，容許跨區轉移未用盡的地積比率至北部都會區或其他地區，以及在七個指定區域為私人重建項目推出增加地積比率措施，並容許將增加的地積比率轉為金額用作抵銷北部都會區或其他地區項目的補地價。此外，政府將展開新一輪工業用地研究，探討活化工廈計劃的未來路向。

（五）減低建造成本：為降低建造成本並提升效率，政府會為大型發展工程簡化審批流程，並設立專責單位分類加快工務工程；放寬私人發展項目停車場總樓面面積豁免安排；推出各項成本管控措施，包括推出成本管控數碼平台、檢視建造標準及要求、試行中央集中採購等。

委員贊同加快北部都會區發展的措施，尤其是設立由行政長官主持的高層次委員會與三個工作組，以及推出專屬法例。委員建議提早與業界、專業團體及其他持分者進行充分諮詢，並認為北部都會區的軟件同樣重要，例如提升地區的宜居程度、提供足夠的社區及文化設施、高效的交通配套及充足而多樣的就業機會。委員亦支持政府鼓勵市場提供更多學生宿舍的措施，並建議與教育機構及發展商更緊密合作，以回應他們的需要。委員支持有關簡化審批及鼓勵更多業界參與的措施，例如「按實補價」及更靈活批地的安排，並建議政府進一步與業界及持分者進行交流，以確保細節在落實時可行及回應發展商及用家需要。

委員支持加快市區重建的建議措施，以應對急速老化的樓宇群，建議政府考慮以更創新的模式鼓勵更多私人市場參與。委員亦認同政府為蘭桂坊進行的美化工程，並建議擴展至周邊的街道；邀請區內商店店主／營運者和專業團體更多參與及合作；優化行人通達性及加入長者友善設計。

政府會繼續聽取持份者的意見，包括業界及專業團體，以期在二○二六年年初起推出建議的措施。

委員亦備悉政府就龍鼓灘和屯門西的發展建議，普遍歡迎以「產業導向」為定位，把該區發展成為「智綠產業港」，發展四個核心產業，即綠色／新能源、先進建造業、循環經濟和現代物流業／內河碼頭，充分利用龍鼓灘和屯門西的策略性位置、廣闊臨海用地、以及便利的交通網絡，促進這些產業的增長，推動綠色及智慧化建設。有關建議可提供高達約301公頃的新發展土地（包括透過近岸填海造地約190公頃及重新規劃約111公頃現有土地）。此外，委員欣悉有關的發展建議可以提升龍鼓灘和屯門西整體環境和設施，並保留自然海岸線及有助促進城鄉共融。初步發展建議亦包括改善地區的道路交通連接，以滿足發展這些產業所帶來的額外交通需求。

委員建議政府考慮採用分階段的模式進行填海工程及推出不同的地塊，配合不同產業的需要及政策優次，例如不涉及填海的土地可先進行平整工程，讓業界能及早使用新土地，及時抓緊發展機遇。委員亦認為政府應考慮從公眾及持份者收集到的意見，就指定的地塊檢視整體規劃及仔細的土地用途。委員提醒政府應推展其他規劃中的道路工程，例如稔灣路及深灣路，以進一步優化有關發展建議的連接性。

政府會繼續與持份者交流，考慮委員以及早前進行公眾參與活動期間收到的意見，敲定有關土地用途建議，以制訂龍鼓灘和屯門西的建議發展大綱圖，目標在二○二六年內展開改劃和其他法定程序。"
CHP responds to media enquiry on respiratory syncytial virus,2025-10-16 21:50,2025-10-16 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101600847.htm,"In response to media enquiry today (October 16) regarding surveillance on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) gave the following response:

RSV is included in routine surveillance
-------------------------------------------

The CHP monitors the activity and disease burden (e.g. mortality and hospitalisation rates) of major local respiratory diseases, including RSV, through a series of surveillance systems. For laboratory surveillance, the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch regularly conducts Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests for RSV on respiratory specimens. Additionally, the CHP monitors RSV-associated hospitalisations in public hospitals based on principal discharge diagnoses and tracks upper respiratory infection outbreaks in schools and residential care institutions. The CHP announces number of positive detections and percentage weekly, and releases the latest epidemiological situation via press releases and online publications periodically.

Influenza-associated hospitalisation rate far exceeds that of RSV
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RSV can cause respiratory tract infections, including infection of the airway, lungs and middle ear. The virus can be transmitted by direct contact with infectious secretions or droplets, or indirectly through contaminated hands, eating utensils or articles freshly soiled by nasal or throat discharges of an infected person. Most people experience only mild symptoms after infection.

The epidemiological pattern of RSV is difference from that of the seasonal influenza. In general, influenza has an obvious seasonal pattern that a peak usually happens in winter and summer; RSV does not have a clear seasonal feature. In some of the years, a peak may happen between May and August, while no regular patterns can be found in some other years. This year, no seasonal peak of RSV has been shown. Laboratory surveillance data revealed that the percentages of specimens tested positive for RSV over the past 12 weeks ranged between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent, which are higher than that of the first-half year when less than 1 per cent was recorded but far lower than 8 per cent to 10 per cent when a peak was recorded in the past.

On the other hand,RSV is similar to influenza and COVID-19, with the elderly and young children being the most affected groups. Fatal cases primarily occur among the elderly, with mortality rates increasing with age. The hospitalisation rate associated with RSV is also higher for elderly persons aged 75 or above.

The CHP's analysis indicated that between January 2023 and June 2025, the average annualised mortality rates associated with RSV among elderly persons aged 75 or above was 10.3 per 100 000 population, which is lower than that of the rate of 80.2 per 100 000 population for seasonal influenza. The hospitalisation rate associated with RSV among elderly persons was also lower than that for seasonal influenza. In recent years, the weekly influenza-associated hospitalisation rate during the peak of influenza seasons was approximately 10 per 100 000 population, while the hospitalisation rate for RSV generally remained below 2 per 100 000 population. The average cumulative hospitalisation rate for influenza among elderly persons was 3.7 times that of RSV.

Prevention of RSV infection
------------------------------

Although the overall disease burden of RSV is lower than seasonal influenza, it is still a respiratory infectious disease with public health significance. The prevention of RSV and other respiratory diseases (such as influenza) are therefore equally important. The public should maintain good personal and environmental hygiene, and wear a surgical mask to prevent transmission if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. The public should also keep the room well-ventilated and if they develop respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, stay home from work or school, avoid crowded places and seek medical attention as soon as possible.

Regarding vaccination, the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) under the CHP regularly reviews the epidemiological situation of local vaccine-preventable diseases, the latest recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), scientific developments and evidence on vaccines, updates on vaccine components, cost-effectiveness studies, as well as actual experiences of other health authorities. It provides relevant vaccination recommendations to the DH from a public health perspective.

During the meeting in January this year, the SCVPD discussed the use of RSV vaccines for elderly persons. After thoroughly reviewing local epidemiological data on RSV disease; the scientific data on the efficacy, safety and potential adverse effects of the vaccines, the experts were of the view that the two RSV vaccines currently registered in Hong Kong are safe and effective.

Regarding vaccination for elderly persons, as specific recommendations from the WHO and local data from the cost-benefit perspective are pending, universal RSV vaccination for elderly persons is not recommended at the moment. The SCVPD considered that elderly persons may consult their family doctor for professional advice to understand the benefits, risks and necessity of vaccination. Based on the doctor's assessment, they can make decisions on whether to proceed with RSV vaccination for personal protection. The Health Bureau has commissioned The University of Hong Kong to conduct an analysis on the cost-benefit of the RSV vaccine. Upon completion of the cost-benefit analysis, the SCVPD will discuss again the issue on RSV vaccination based on the relevant analysis results and latest scientific evidence. The recommendations of the SCVPD in January are available on the CHP website.

The CHP will continue to closely monitor major local respiratory diseases and regularly publish data. It will also remind healthcare professionals and members of the public of relevant public health information and recommendations in a timely manner through appropriate channels."
香港和南沙順利進行大灣區跨境直通救護車演練（附圖）,2025-10-16 21:23,2025-10-16 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101500841.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十月十六日）聯同廣州市南沙區人民政府就「大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃」（試行計劃）進行演練，測試在模擬載送病人的情況下的救護車跨境由中山大學附屬第一醫院南沙院區至屯門醫院的行車路線及出入境安排。

行政長官在剛發表的《施政報告》中提出，聯同粵澳政府有序地擴展救護車跨境轉運病人安排，包括實施雙向轉運，以及納入珠海和南沙兩地指定醫院。醫務衞生局（醫衞局）早前公布試行計劃將會擴展至珠海市人民醫院和中山大學附屬第一醫院南沙院區。

醫衞局局長盧寵茂教授表示：「今日的演練大致暢順，預計可於年底前將試行計劃擴展至南沙。香港特區政府一直致力深化與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）城市之間的醫療衞生合作，推動大灣區醫療融合，建設『健康灣區』。在去年推出的試行計劃的運作基礎上，我們在上月二十六日及今天分別與珠海及南沙兩地順利進行了演練，為下一階段擴展試行計劃做好準備。粵港兩地政府部門會繼續保持緊密溝通和合作，積極推進《施政報告》提出有序擴展救護車跨境轉運病人的安排。」

自試行計劃啓動以來，整體運作良好，至今已將17名病人由深圳和澳門的指定派送醫院（即香港大學深圳醫院和澳門仁伯爵綜合醫院）轉運到香港的指定公立醫院。根據專業醫療評估，上述個案的病人均有持續住院的治療需要，情況相對穩定，但無法自行返港，亦不適合經現有口岸轉乘香港救護車返港。"
Drill for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in GBA by Hong Kong and Nansha conducted smoothly (with photos),2025-10-16 21:23,2025-10-16 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101500842.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, in collaboration with the Nansha District People's Government of Guangzhou Municipality, conducted a drill today (October 16) for the Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in the Greater Bay Area (Pilot Scheme), simulating the transfer of patients by cross-boundary ambulance between the Nansha Division of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University (NSSYH) and the Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH), with a view to testing the route and immigration arrangements.

  In his recent Policy Address, the Chief Executive proposed to extend the cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements with the governments of Guangdong and Macao in an orderly manner, including two-way transfers and expansion to cover designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha. The Health Bureau (HHB) announced earlier that the Pilot Scheme will be extended to Zhuhai People's Hospital and NSSYH.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""Today's drill was conducted smoothly in general, and the Pilot Scheme is expected to be extended to Nansha by the end of this year. The HKSAR Government has been striving to deepen healthcare collaboration with other Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) cities to foster healthcare integration within the GBA, thereby building a 'Healthy Bay Area'. Building upon the operational foundation of the Pilot Scheme launched last year, we conducted drills smoothly with Zhuhai and Nansha on the 26th of last month and today respectively, preparing for the extension of the Pilot Scheme in the next phase. The government departments of Guangdong and Hong Kong will continue to maintain close communication and co-operation to press ahead with the extension of the cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements in an orderly manner as set out in the Policy Address.""

  The overall operation of the Pilot Scheme has been smooth since its implementation. A total of 17 patients were transferred from the designated sending hospitals in Shenzhen and Macao (i.e. the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital and the Conde S. Januario Hospital of Macao) to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong. According to professional medical assessment, patients of the above cases have a need for continuous hospitalisation for treatment. Their conditions were relatively stable, but they were unable to return to Hong Kong on their own and were unsuitable for transfer to Hong Kong ambulances via the existing boundary control points."
Land and Development Advisory Committee holds meeting,2025-10-16 21:11,2025-10-16 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101600766.htm,"At its meeting today (October 16), the Land and Development Advisory Committee was briefed by the Development Bureau (DEVB) on major initiatives related to the Bureau in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address (Policy Address), as well as the development proposal for Lung Kwu Tan Reclamation (LKT) and the re-planning of Tuen Mun West area (TMW).

Members supported the Government's commitment to sustaining its land creation efforts in a paced manner to provide a steady land supply to meet the economic and society needs of Hong Kong, and the proposed innovative initiatives which responded to the market condition as well as the views and needs of the industry and professional bodies. These key measures included:

(a) Sustaining Land Creation in a Paced Manner: the projected completion of developable land over the next decade would reach approximately 2600 hectares, with around 70 per cent coming from the Northern Metropolis (NM). It is estimated that the target of delivering approximately 150 hectares of developable land within the current fiscal year would be attained. The Government would also continue to advance various land formation projects, including LKT, Tseung Kwan O Area 137 and Area 132, as well as the expansion of Tung Chung New Town.

(b) Expediting the NM development: establishment of a new high-level governance structure, namely the Northern Metropolis Development Committee chaired by the Chief Executive, underpinned by three working groups on design of development and operation models, planning and construction of the UniTown, and planning and development respectively. Other key initiatives to speed up development of NM include a dedicated legislation to streamline statutory procedures, set up statutory industry park and dedicated funding channels, and speed up approvals and land resumption and compensation. The Government will also streamline administrative procedures and remove barriers, as well as promote investment and public-private partnerships, through phased development approach, flexible arrangements for premium calculation and granting of tenancies, etc. Some of these measures will also be applicable to the whole territory.

(c) Supporting Industry Development: The Government will implement a number of initiatives to promote industry development, including the ""Hostels in the City Scheme"" to encourage the market to increase supply of student hostels to consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international post-secondary education hub; taking forward projects for yacht berthing space to support the development of yacht economy; enriching visitor experience of rural eco-tour; and coordinating works related to beautifying the streetscape of Lan Kwan Fong and streets nearby, which would be implemented by phases.

(d) Urban Renewal and Releasing industrial Land in Urban Areas: to accelerateurban renewal to address the problem of aging buildings, the Government has proposed three measures with a new mind-set, namely reserving three sites in NM new development areas for the Urban Renewal Authority to build new flats under the revamped Flat-for-Flat Scheme; relaxing arrangements for transfer of plot ratio by allowing cross-district transfer of under-utilised plot ratio to NM or other districts; and introducing additional plot ratio incentives for private redevelopment projects in the seven designated areas and allowing encashment of such additional plot ratio to offset the premium payable for projects in NM or other districts. Furthermore, the Government will commence a new round of study on industrial land to explore the future of the revitalisation scheme for industrial buildings.

(e) Reducing Construction Cost: to reduce construction costs and enhance efficiency, the Government will streamline approval procedures for large-scale development works and establish dedicated units within the DEVB to expedite the processing of public works projects; relax the gross floor area exemption arrangement for carparks in private developments; and introduce various cost control measures, including launching the ""Project Cost Management Platform"", reviewing construction standards and requirement, conducting central procurement on a trial basis, etc.

Members applauded the measures accelerating the development of NM, in particular the establishment of a high-level committee chaired by the Chief Executive and the three working groups, as well as the introduction of a dedicated legislation. Members suggested ensuring sufficient prior consultation with the industries, professional bodies and other stakeholders, and opined that the software aspects of NM such as enhancing the liveability of the district, provision of sufficient community and cultural facilities, and efficient transport connectivity and sufficient variety of employment opportunities, were equally important. Members also supported the Government's initiatives to encourage provision of more student hostels in the market, and suggested closer collaboration with the educational institutions and developers to address their needs. While expressing support for the measures to streamline approval and encourage more industry participation, such as ""pay for what you build"" and more flexible land grant arrangements, Members suggested the Government further engage the industry and stakeholders to ensure that the implementation details were practicable and would meet the needs of developers and users.

Members supported the proposed measures to speed up the pace of urban renewal, in light of the rapidly ageing building stock, and suggested the Government consider innovative models to facilitate more private sector participation. Members also recognised the Government's effort to conduct beautification works for Lan Kwai Fong, and suggested expanding the scope to the surrounding streets, inviting more participation and collaboration with the shop owners/operators in the district and the professional sectors, improving pedestrian connectivity and incorporating elderly-friendly designs.

The Government would continue to solicit the views and feedback of stakeholders, including industry and professional bodies, with a view to rolling out the proposed measures in batches starting from early 2026.

Members were also briefed on the Government's development proposal for LKT and TMW, and generally supported the industry-led positioning for developing the area into a ""Smart and Green Industrial Port"" for four core industries, namely green/new energy, advanced construction, circular economy and modern logistics/River Trade Terminal, with a view to making full use of the strategic location, extensive sea frontage, and convenient transport network of LKT and TMW to foster the growth of these industries and advance their green and smart development. The proposal would be able to provide up to 301 hectares of new developable land (including around 190 hectares of new land to be created through near-shore reclamation and around 111 hectares of existing land through re-planning). In addition, Members appreciated that the proposed development would uplift the overall environment and infrastructure of LKT and TMW, which would preserve natural shorelines and help promote urban rural integration. The preliminary development proposal also includes enhancement to the local road transport connections to meet the extra transport demand arising from the development of these industries.

Members suggested that the Government consider adopting a phased approach in conducting reclamation and rolling out different land parcels, dovetailing with the needs and policy priorities of various industries. For instance, sites not involving reclamation could be formed first to allow the industry's early utilisation of the new land to take advantage of development opportunities in a timely manner. Members also opined that the Government should review the overall planning and detailed land use of specific land parcels taking into account the views gathered from the public and relevant stakeholders. Members reminded the Government to put forward other road infrastructure projects under planning such as Nim Wan Road and Deep Bay Road which would further improve connectivity of the proposed development.

The Government will continue to engage stakeholders and take into account the views expressed by Members and the feedback received from the public engagement exercise conducted earlier when finalising the land use proposal, with a target to commence rezoning and other statutory procedures within 2026."
衞生防護中心回應傳媒有關呼吸道合胞病毒的查詢,2025-10-16 20:50,2025-10-16 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101600750.htm,"​就傳媒今日（十月十六日）有關監測呼吸道合胞病毒的查詢，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）回應如下：

呼吸道合胞病毒已納入恆常監測
——————————————

中心一直透過一系列監測系統，監察本地主要呼吸道疾病（包括呼吸道合胞病毒）的活躍情況及疾病負擔（例如死亡率和住院率）。在實驗室監測方面，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會恆常為呼吸道樣本進行中呼吸道合胞病毒核酸檢測。此外，中心會根據主要出院診斷監測公立醫院內呼吸道合胞病毒相關的住院情況，並監察學校及院舍的上呼吸道感染爆發情況。中心每周在網頁公布陽性數字及百分比，並會不時透過新聞公報及網上刊物發布最新流行病學情況。

流感住院率遠高於呼吸道合胞病毒
———————————————

呼吸道合胞病毒可引致呼吸道疾病，例如氣管、肺部及中耳的感染。病毒可通過接觸患者的分泌物或飛沫直接傳播，或通過受污染的手、食具或接觸受到患者鼻或喉部分泌物污染的物件而間接傳播。大部分人士感染呼吸道合胞病毒後，病情一般輕微。

呼吸道合胞病毒的流行模式與季節性流感有所不同。一般而言，流感在香港具有明顯的季節性，通常在冬季及夏季出現高峰期；而呼吸道合胞病毒的季節性特徵並不明顯。有些年份，其高峰期可能在五月至八月期間出現，但有些年份則無明顯規律。今年，呼吸道合胞病毒的流行情況同樣未呈現明顯的季節性高峰。實驗室監測數據顯示，過去12周呼吸道合胞病毒的陽性百分比徘徊在2.5%至3.5%之間，相較今年上半年每周少於1%的水平為高，但遠低於以往高峰期錄得的8%至10%。

另一方面，呼吸道合胞病毒與流感及新冠病毒相似，長者和幼兒是最受影響的群組。死亡個案主要集中在長者，當中死亡率隨着年齡增長而增加。此外，與呼吸道合胞病毒感染相關的住院率在75歲或以上長者亦較高。

中心的分析顯示，在二○二三年一月至二○二五年六月期間，75歲或以上長者與呼吸道合胞病毒相關的死亡率平均每年為每100 000人有10.3宗，低於季節性流感的每100 000人有80.2宗。長者與呼吸道合胞病毒感染相關的住院率亦低於季節性流感。近年來，流感相關的每周住院率在流感季節高峰期約為每100 000人有10宗，而呼吸道合胞病毒的住院率一般維持在每100 000人有2宗以下。在長者中，流感的平均累積住院率為呼吸道合胞病毒的3.7倍。

預防呼吸道合胞病毒感染
——————————

雖然呼吸道合胞病毒的整體疾病負擔低於季節性流感，但仍是一種對公共衞生有重要影響的呼吸道傳染病。因此，預防呼吸道合胞病毒感染與其他呼吸道疾病（如流感）同樣重要。市民應保持良好的個人和環境衞生，如出現發燒和呼吸道症狀時，應佩戴外科口罩，以防傳播病毒。市民應確保室內空氣流通，若有呼吸道症狀，應佩戴外科口罩，避免上班或上學，減少前往人多擠擁的地方，並盡早求醫。

疫苗接種方面，中心轄下疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會（科學委員會）定期檢視本地疫苗可預防疾病的流行病學情況、世界衞生組織（世衞）的最新建議、疫苗的科學發展及證據、疫苗成分的更新、成本效益研究，以及其他衞生當局的實際應用經驗，從公共衞生角度向衞生署提供不同疫苗接種建議。

科學委員會剛在今年一月的會議討論長者使用呼吸道合胞病毒疫苗的事宜。專家詳細審視呼吸道合胞病毒的本地流行病學數據、有關疫苗效力、安全性和潛在不良反應的科學數據後，認為已在本港註冊的兩款呼吸道合胞病毒疫苗安全及有效。

就長者接種方面，由於有待世衞提出具體建議和取得相關成本效益分析的本地數據，因此暫時不建議為全部長者普遍接種呼吸道合胞病毒疫苗。科學委員會認為長者可考慮徵詢家庭醫生的專業意見，了解接種相關疫苗的效益、風險及必要性，並根據醫生的評估，決定是否接種呼吸道合胞病毒疫苗作個人保護。醫務衞生局已委託香港大學進行有關呼吸道合胞病毒疫苗成本效益分析。待成本效益分析完成後，科學委員會將根據相關分析結果及最新科學實證，再次討論呼吸道合胞病毒疫苗接種事宜。科學委員會當時的建議已上載中心網頁（只有英文）。

 中心會繼續密切監察本地主要呼吸道疾病和定期公布數據，亦會適時透過合適渠道提醒醫護人員和公眾有關公共衞生的資訊和建議。"

"DH urges members of public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccines as influenza activity continues to rise, with outbreaks of influenza-like illness reported in many schools and residential care homes",2025-10-16 19:48,2025-10-16 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101600716.htm,"In light of the continued increase in influenza activity and outbreaks of influenza-like illness (ILI)in schools and residential care homes (RCHs), the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 16) urged all persons aged 6 months or above (except those with known contraindications) to receive the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) as soon as possible to minimise the risk of serious complications and death following infection.

Influenza activity continues to rise
---------------------------------------
Hong Kong has entered the summer influenza season, and the influenza activity continues to rise. The CHP's latest surveillance data showed that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses during the past week (October 5 to 11) was 12.02 per cent, which is higher than the 9.70 per cent recorded during the preceding week and exceeds the peak of 10.54 per cent during the winter influenza season earlier this year. Influenza A(H3) is the predominant circulating strain, accounting for nearly 80 per cent of all detected viruses, followed by influenza A(H1) at slightly over 10 per cent. Influenza B accounted for the remainder. The influenza admission rate in public hospitals is 0.67 cases per 10 000 population, which is higher than the 0.52 cases recorded during the preceding week. There has also been an increase in outbreaks of ILI in schools and RCHs over the past two weeks. As of yesterday (October 15), 451 outbreaks had been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September. Among them, 43, 244 and 164 cases occurred in kindergartens/child care centres, primary schools and secondary schools respectively. During the same period, nine severe cases and one fatal case of paediatric influenza involving children aged 3 to 17 have been recorded. Eight of them had good past health.

""Summer influenza seasons do not occur every year in Hong Kong. It usually occurred between July and August and lasted for six to 18 weeks. The emergence of a summer influenza season in September is uncommon. Since the public received their SIV over nine months ago, the protective immunity generated by the SIV has relatively waned. Coupled with the fact that the new seasonal influenza vaccines for this season have only recently become available on the market and some people have not yet received this year's SIV, this year's summer influenza outbreak is expected to be relatively severe. Based on the current level of influenza activity and trend analysis, the local influenza activity is expected to remain at a relatively high level over the next few weeks. Furthermore, viruses tend to become more active when the temperature drops towards the end of the year. The winter influenza season in Hong Kong typically occurs between January and March. The current summer influenza season may overlap with the upcoming winter influenza season, which could lead to a higher hospitalisation rate due to influenza infection,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""The 2025/26 SIV Programmes offers injectable inactivated influenza vaccines (both trivalent and quadrivalent), recombinant influenza vaccines and live attenuated influenza vaccines. All of them cover both influenza A and B viruses and can effectively prevent seasonal influenza and its complications,"" he added.

2025/26 SIV Programmes
-----------------------------

To boost SIV rates, enrolment for the SIV School Outreach Programme has started since the beginning of June this year, which was earlier than last year. With the concerted efforts of the Government and various community sectors (including the medical sector and schools), approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) are going to arrange SIV school outreach activities. Among these, over 1 330 schools (58 per cent) have scheduled to carry out the outreach activities by the end of this month, and over 2 160 schools (94 per cent) by the end of next month (November), which are respectively higher than last year's 45 per cent and 83 per cent. Currently, about 410 schools have held school outreach activities, with the earliest session taking place on September 29.

""Through the concerted efforts of schools, this season's school outreach activities will generally be completed earlier than last season's. However, given the emergence of this year's summer influenza season, coupled with the recent increase in seasonal influenza activity and the number of school outbreaks, we have urged relevant schools to advance the vaccination outreach services further, where feasible. Following intensive coordination by the CHP, 15 schools (including seven secondary schools, two primary schools and six kindergartens/child care centres) will advance their outreach activities originally scheduled for December this year or January next year to before the end of next month. The CHP will continue to actively liaise with the remaining relevant schools to provide feasible assistance,"" Dr Tsui said.

Regarding the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme (VSS), over 1 800 private doctors have applied to participate so far.

""With the support of private doctors, both the number of participating doctors and vaccination venues increased compared to the same period last season. So far, the number of doses administered under the VSS has increased by approximately 12 per cent, compared to the same period last season, demonstrating the impact of private doctors network on boosting vaccination rates. For the newly launched pilot scheme on vaccine procurement for family doctors, the Government has helped procure an additional 100 000 doses of injectable inactivated influenza vaccines for specified VSS family doctors. These doctors have ordered over 60 000 doses of influenza vaccines so far, indicating a positive response,"" he added.

The sooner one receives seasonal influenza vaccines the better
----------------------------------------------------------------------

""Influenza can cause serious illnesses among high-risk individuals and even in healthy persons. SIV is one of the most effective ways of preventing seasonal influenza and its complications. It can also reduce influenza-related hospitalisation and death due to seasonal influenza. SIV is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. I wish to particularly remind high-risk groups, such as the elderly, children, and adults with underlying illnesses and immunosuppression, to get SIV as soon as possible. Members of the public may also contact their family doctors to arrange for vaccinations,"" Dr Tsui said.

Speech by CE at BritCham Hong Kong Summit 2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-10-16 19:38,2025-10-16 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101600699.htm,"Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Britcham Hong Kong Summit 2025 today (October 16):

Consul General Mr Brian Davidson (British Consul General to Hong Kong and Macao), Jeremy (Chair of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (BritCham), Mr Jeremy Sheldon), Paul (Executive Director of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, Mr Paul McComb), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to join you, once again, for the annual British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong Summit.

This year's Summit agenda smartly responds to BritCham's ""Asia's World City x BritCham"" campaign, formally launched here today. The campaign's four pillars - work, live, play and learn - and how Hong Kong makes it happen - are the themes of today's panels.

This direction resonates well with the Government's priorities. Reform is the driving force behind my Policy Address last month, and the Government's commitment to the economy, to the people, and to Hong Kong.

Governments alone cannot deliver successful reform. For that, we need the impelling commitment of industry, business and community. That includes its institutions, local and international.

It's clear, and importantly gratifying, that we can count on the co-operation of BritCham and its 1 100 corporate and individual members. Through your campaign, you will help us tell the true and good Hong Kong stories, that today's Hong Kong remains Asia's world city - in business and finance, innovation and technology (I&T), education, culture and lifestyle.

BritCham has taken the initiative to engage the world on behalf of Hong Kong for its own good reasons, and that of its members, because when Hong Kong prospers, we all prosper.

Hong Kong-UK merchandise trade amounted to US$15.6 billion last year. The average growth between 2020 and 2024 was a solid 2.6 per cent a year. And the UK is Hong Kong's third-largest trading partner in services, up more than 10 per cent, year on year, to US$14.7 billion in 2023.

Bilateral investment remains strong, reflecting the long-term promise our respective businesses and investors see in each other's economies. At the end of 2023, the UK ranked fourth in inward direct investment into Hong Kong, and sixth in outward direct investment from Hong Kong. 

There's good news, too, in the number of UK companies with a presence here - some 720 as of last December. That, I'm happy to note, was up over 12 per cent, year on year, and marks a record high. And I'm confident that UK companies will continue to turn to Hong Kong - and BritCham Hong Kong.

There are many good reasons for optimism. For the next few minutes, I would like to share with you a few of the sectors, industries and areas the HKSAR Government is prioritising: for our economy and community, our businesses, our families, all of us and our future.

Hong Kong's rise as a global city was built on free trade, beginning in the 19th century with the UK and fast expanding to a world of business. As a founding member of the World Trade Organization, we believe in the rules-based multilateral trading system and the mutual rewards it offers companies, economies and countries.

That steadfast commitment to free trade was rewarded, once again this year, by the Fraser Institute, which named Hong Kong as the world's freest economy, number one.

Thanks to the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, we create connections, and opportunities, with both our country and the rest of the world.

Enhancing our global network

As I noted in my Policy Address, we will continue to expand our connectivity. We will deepen integration with the country through the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and enhance connections with the world, exploring overseas markets in Belt and Road regions, the Global South, the Middle East and, of course, the UK; wherever we can build partnerships in a world increasingly beset with unilateralism, arbitrary barriers and dismaying discord.

Since assuming office in July 2022, I have led high-level business delegations to the Middle East twice and to multiple ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states on three occasions.

Our overseas offices help us build connections and the market opportunities they create. To date, we have set up Economic and Trade Offices, or ETOs, as well as Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) and Trade Development Council (TDC) offices in 68 cities around the world, covering 129 countries.

And we are still building bridges. An ETO in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, is expected to begin operation by year's end. We are working with Saudi Arabia to establish an ETO in Riyadh, the country's capital, and we plan to expand the coverage of existing ETOs to Latin America and Central Asia.

As I noted in my Policy Address, we will establish the Economic and Trade Express to help local companies go global. That, I trust, means many of you here today.

Supported by our ETOs, InvestHK and the TDC, the new service will organise overseas business missions to help SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) and start-ups explore new markets and build their businesses. It will offer additional trade and investment promotion activities, and highlight the advantages of Hong Kong to overseas business.

  ""Going global"" certainly applies to the many Mainland companies we aspire to serve. It is why the GoGlobal Task Force (Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global) was launched 10 days ago. As I said in my Policy Address, the Task Force co-ordinates InvestHK, the Trade Development Council and other government agencies.

Taking full advantage of our world-class financial and professional services, the GoGlobal Task Force will serve as a springboard to Mainland companies keen to expand overseas. It will work closely with business organisations and chambers such as yours, and pool expertise and smooth the way for Mainland companies. We will help them connect, faster and more efficiently, with global markets and buyers.

I understand that a BritCham delegation recently returned from Beijing, where discussions included how BritCham could support Chinese companies going global. Now that's a ringing illustration of reaching out, of co-operation creating promising opportunities, and what good business is all about. We definitely have a lot to work together.

As of last year, more than 2 600 Mainland enterprises had established operations in Hong Kong. In addition, more than 1 400 had listed here. That presents lots of GoGlobal opportunities - for Hong Kong, and for this chamber.

As those numbers underline, Hong Kong is the paramount destination for Chinese companies looking to access offshore capital, and for the world seeking the Mainland's deep capital market.

International financial centre

The remarkable performance of our IPO listings this year, surpassing all other major international markets, is just one aspect of Hong Kong's dynamism.

Last month's Global Financial Centres Index placed us third globally, just two points back of New York, one behind London, our good friend. It highlights our connectivity, as well as Hong Kong's ability to connect the Mainland and a world of capital.

And the Government is committed to boosting Hong Kong's global appeal, as my Policy Address makes it very clear.

Hong Kong is the largest offshore Renminbi business hub in the world, and we are working to diversify our Renminbi offerings. The Monetary Authority will introduce a Renminbi business facility to help companies get the longer-term financing they need for trade, capital expenditure and day-to-day operation. And to ensure a secure source of Renminbi funds at modest cost, it's pursuing broader channels for acquiring cross-boundary capital, while enabling foreign exchange quotations and transactions between Renminbi and other regional currencies.

Ladies and gentlemen, as the Chinese proverb goes, ""real gold is not afraid of the melting pot"" - and not afraid of volatilities, it seems - last week reaching a record US$4,000 per troy ounce.

The HKSAR Government is expediting the development of Hong Kong as an international gold trading market. In my Policy Address, I outlined a number of conducive measures, including building a gold storing capacity of more than 2 000 tonnes over the next three years.

We will establish a central clearing system for gold, inviting the Shanghai Gold Exchange to work with us in realising mutual market access with the Mainland. The International Board of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, let me add, has established its first offshore delivery vault, here in Hong Kong.

We are inviting gold traders to set up refineries here, and support the creation of a gold industry trade association.

Still with commodity trading, the London Metal Exchange last month approved the addition of three storage facilities in Hong Kong. That takes the number of warehouses here to 11 since January, when the Exchange included Hong Kong as a delivery point in its global warehousing network.

I have high hopes that relations between Hong Kong and the UK could continue to be as good as gold - as forever as gold. So I'm pleased to note that, in June, the Financial Services Development Council signed an MOU with TheCityUK. It's designed to boost collaboration between our two financial markets.

Innovation and technology

This year's Global Innovation Index ranked the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster first in the world's top 100 innovation clusters, after five years as runner-up.

That speaks well of the Greater Bay Area's commitment to rising as a global hub for innovation and technology. It speaks clearly, too, of Hong Kong emergence as an I&T force within the Greater Bay Area and throughout the region.

Central to that is the Northern Metropolis. Hong Kong Park, part of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, continues its rise in the Northern Metropolis. It is part of the Northern Metropolis. Tenants, including companies specialising in life and health technology, AI, new energy and other strategic industries, are moving into the Park's first three buildings. Five additional buildings will be completed, progressively, from 2027.

By the end of this year, the HKSAR Government will publish an outline plan for the San Tin Technopole - again, a big part of the Northern Metropolis. A huge and inviting area, it will provide about 210 hectares of land for prime I&T development within the Northern Metropolis.

Our I&T ambitions, of course, will only be met with a growing flow of strategic talent. On that score, I'm pleased to note two recent results, clear and compelling testament to the success or competiveness in our comprehensive talent drive.

Attracting enterprises

A week ago, OASES, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, welcomed another 18 new companies, including three of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical corporations - one of them from the UK - to Hong Kong. That takes the number of strategic enterprises drew in by OASES to 102, creating employment in Hong Kong, investing in Hong Kong, setting up regional headquarters and initiating research and development projects, right here in Hong Kong.

As I noted in the Policy Address, the Financial Secretary will head a team putting together preferential policies to attract more strategic companies to come to Hong Kong for their future - and our future.

Last week, as well, UK-founded Times Higher Education released its World University Rankings 2026. Hong Kong, once again, was the only city in the world that had five universities ranked among the global top 100. I'm delighted to add that six are now listed among the world's top 200 universities. And, for the first time, all eight of our publicly funded universities have made the global rankings.

Just last month, the World Talent Ranking, released by the International Institute for Management Development, ranked Hong Kong fourth in the world - and tops in Asia.

Asia's world city

Ladies and gentlemen, I invite more UK strategic companies and professionals to join us - for a world of business opportunity; for a world of arts and culture, sports and entertainment, too.

Yes, as BritCham's Asia's World City campaign emphasises, Hong Kong is the region's wide and welcoming hub for the good life. In my Policy Address, I introduced our ""tourism is everywhere"" policy priority.

We're expanding our mega events offerings, adding a wealth of cultural festivals and other major offerings. We're developing the yacht economy and cruise tourism, upgrading our country park facilities, adding traditional village and field attractions, new tourism routes, even a tree-top adventure.

And next February, the Year of the Horse begins. Count on a winning variety of horse-racing celebrations.

Next month, the East Kowloon Cultural Centre opens, a five-venue showcase for world-class arts technology performances and long-running theatrical runs. Next month, too, the 15th National Games gets going, with Hong Kong a cohost, alongside Guangdong and Macao, for the first time.

Yes, in Hong Kong, the attraction, thrills and non-stop excitement are everywhere you look.

My thanks to the British Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong for organising this essential annual gathering. I am grateful, too, for your much-valued contributions to Hong Kong's success as a leading international economy and flourishing global community. Asia's world city.

Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all the best of business, health and happiness in the coming year.

Thank you very much."

流感活躍程度持續上升  多間學校和院舍爆發流感樣疾病　衞生署呼籲市民盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-10-16 19:15,2025-10-16 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101600654.htm,"鑑於流感活躍程度持續上升，多間學校和院舍爆發流感樣疾病，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月十六日）呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士盡快接種季節性流感疫苗（個別有已知禁忌症的人士除外），以減低重症及死亡的風險。

流感活躍程度持續上升
——————————

本港現時正處於夏季流感季節，流感活躍程度持續上升。中心最新監測數據顯示，過去一周（十月五至十一日），呼吸道樣本中流感病毒檢測呈陽性的百分比為12.02%，高於前一周錄得的9.70%，並已超越今年初冬季流感季節最高一周的10.54%。目前主要流行的病毒為甲型（H3）流感，佔整體病毒檢測接近八成，其次為甲型（H1）流感，約佔一成多，餘下為乙型流感。公立醫院住院病人被診斷為流感的入院率為每一萬人有0.67宗入院個案，高於前一周的0.62宗。學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發個案近兩周亦有所上升，截至昨日（十月十五日），自九月開學以來，涉及學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案共有451宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（43宗）、小學（244宗）及中學（164宗）。同期，中心錄得九宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重和一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎3至17歲，其中八人過往的健康狀況良好。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港並非每年都會出現夏季流感季節，一般在七月至八月間出現，維持6至18星期。今年在九月出現夏季流感並不常見，由於市民上一季度接種季節性流感疫苗至今已經超過九個月，體內產生的保護力亦已相對減少，加上新一季度的流感疫苗才剛開始供應，部份市民還未接種，因此今年夏季流感疫情將會相對嚴峻。按目前流感活躍程度和趨勢分析，流感活躍程度在未來幾星期仍維持在較高水平。另一方面，當年底氣溫下降，病毒一般會較活躍。香港的冬季流感季節大多在一月至三月期間出現，今次夏季流感季節有可能與下一個冬季流感重疊，導致因感染流感而住院的人數較以往更多。」

他續說：「二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃下提供注射式滅活流感疫苗（不論三價或四價）、重組流感疫苗和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗，全部都涵蓋甲型和乙型流感，可以有效預防流感及其併發症。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃
————————————————————

為提高季節性流感疫苗接種率，中心今年已提早於六月初開始接受學校報名參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃。在政府和社會各界（包括醫療界和學校等）的共同努力下，目前已有約2 300間學校（總數的99%）會舉行流感疫苗學校外展活動，當中超過1 330間學校（58%）會於本月底或之前進行外展活動，而約2 160間學校（94%）則會於下月（十一月）底或之前進行，分別較去年的45%和83%為高。現時共有約410間學校已舉行外展活動，最早的學校外展活動已於九月二十九日舉行。

徐樂堅醫生說：「在學校的通力合作下，本季度的學校外展活動普遍將較上一季度早完成。然而，因應今年夏季流感的出現，加上近期的流感活躍程度和學校爆發宗數上升，我們已敦促相關學校，在可行的情況下進一步提早接種疫苗的外展活動服務。經中心全力協調後，有15間學校（包括七間中學、兩間小學和六間幼稚園／幼兒中心）將原訂於今年十二月或明年一月的外展活動提前至下月底前舉行。中心會繼續積極聯絡其餘的相關學校，以提供可行協助。」

疫苗資助計劃方面，現時有超過1 800名私家醫生已參與。

他說：「在私家醫生的支持下，參與本季度疫苗資助計劃的醫生人數和接種點數目都較上一季度同期為多。目前為止，疫苗資助計劃下的接種劑量較上一季度同期增加約12%，彰顯了私家醫生網路有助提升疫苗接種率。今年新推出『家庭醫生疫苗採購先導計劃』，政府為參與疫苗資助計劃的指定家庭醫生採購了100 000劑注射式滅活流感疫苗，至今，相關的私家醫生已通過先導計劃訂購了超過60 000劑流感疫苗，反應理想。」

接種季節性流感疫苗宜早不宜遲

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-16 18:55,2025-10-16 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101600672.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月十六日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

個案涉及一名55歲女子，住所位於觀塘區。初步調查顯示，她於十月九日至十日獨自到訪廣東省中山市。她十月十三日出現關節痛，翌日（十月十四日）發燒，昨日（十月十五日）到基督教聯合醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

她有兩名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於她於潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得39宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：

在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-16 18:55,2025-10-16 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101600673.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 16), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

The case involves a 55-year-old female living in Kwun Tong District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Zhongshan in Guangdong alone on October 9 and 10. She developed joint pain on October 13, followed by a fever the next day (October 14). She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment yesterday (October 15). She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

 The patient has two household contacts, who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 39 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

藍岸常務副社長（《香港商報》常務副社長兼執行總編輯）、中聯辦劉斌處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部貿易處辦公室處長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！十分榮幸獲邀出席今天的「2025傑出企業家大獎」頒獎典禮。首先，熱烈祝賀各位得獎的企業，同時也感謝舉辦單位《香港商報》所付出的努力，表揚香港企業家在推動經濟、創造就業、熱心公益、引領創新方面所作出的貢獻。

國家主席習近平表示：「社會是企業家施展才華的舞台。只有真誠回報社會、切實履行社會責任的企業家，才能真正得到社會認可，才是符合時代要求的企業家。」我期待各位傑出企業家以至其他優秀企業能以這次獎項殊榮為推動力，進一步為國家、為香港的社會經濟發展作出新的更大貢獻。

特區政府一直透過多元政策和舉措，鞏固和提升香港作為國際金融、貿易、航運中心的地位，並致力支持各行各業企業的發展。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有「內聯外通」的獨特優勢，我們必須抓住國家發展的無限機遇，透過「立足本地、聯動灣區、拓展國際」的策略，在複雜多變的地緣政治和國際競爭環境下，不斷尋求發掘更多新的經濟增長點，推動香港經濟持續發展的同時，也助力國家的高質量發展。

「背靠祖國、聯通世界」是香港得天獨厚的顯著優勢。作為東西文化薈萃的國際大都會以及國家與世界之間的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，我們絕對有能力和優勢助力國家吸引更多外國資金、人才、技術通過香港進入內地的廣袤市場，同時亦可助力內地企業、品牌和人才透過香港「一國兩制」的獨特優勢和各種營商、專業服務優勢和地位開拓國際市場和參與國際競爭，發揮香港「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台關鍵作用，同時亦為本港企業帶來無限商機。

特區政府會繼續積極融入國家發展大局，主動對接國家重大發展戰略。我們更會繼續聯同粵、澳兩地全面加快粵港澳大灣區的高質量建設，不斷以創新求變、互利共贏的態度深化粵港澳三地的規則銜接和機制對接，促進區內人流、物流、信息流、資金流等重要生產要素高效流動，同時爭取更多惠港利民、促進灣區融合發展的政策措施。在不斷增強香港發展動能的同時，亦助力國家高質量發展和高水平對外開放。

此外，我們亦會繼續充分發揮香港高度國際化的顯著優勢，不斷深化國際的交往合作，致力擴展國際經貿網絡，積極開拓東盟、中東及「一帶一路」沿線國家等的新興市場，以及全力籌備今年在馬來西亞吉隆坡開設的全新海外經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦）和繼續與沙特阿拉伯政府保持緊密合作，積極跟進在利雅得開設經貿辦的計劃。我們亦會繼續積極爭取盡早加入《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》，繼續積極尋求與貿易夥伴探討締結自由貿易協定及促進和保護投資協定，以及組織外訪考察、舉辦重點活動等，以進一步擴大香港經貿「朋友圈」，對外說好香港故事，促進香港的長遠經濟發展。

各位，習主席表示：「企業營銷無國界，企業家有祖國。優秀企業家必須對國家、對民族懷有崇高使命感和強烈責任感，把企業發展同國家繁榮、民族興盛、人民幸福緊密結合在一起。」這是習主席對企業家們的殷切期望和期盼，希望大家都能認真學習並體會習主席的精神。

在未來，我期望各位企業家能繼續發揮推動香港經濟發展主力軍的作用，並延續香港商界愛國愛港的優良傳統，更要注入新生代的創新活力，在國家新一輪改革開放和香港「由治及興」進程中找到更大舞台、發揮更大作用、作出新的更大貢獻。

最後，請容許我趁此機會向大家作出呼籲。二○二五年立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行。今次是特區完善選舉制度後舉行的第二次立法會選舉。而大家亦知道，特區行政立法相互配合、立法會盡責履職並充分發揮議會功能，對「一國兩制」行穩致遠、特區良政善治至關重要。因此，今次選舉無論對社會各界以至廣大市民都是意義重大，而選舉提名期即將於十月二十四日開始，至十一月六日結束。我謹呼籲所有愛國愛港、具能力、有抱負、有志服務社會的人士請積極報名參加選舉，而廣大市民亦請緊記在十二月七日踴躍投票，一起履行公民責任，選出大家心儀信任的議員，共同為大家服務，一起創建更美好的香港！

最後，祝願各位企業家生意興隆、業務蒸蒸日上！在座各位生活愉快、家庭幸福！

多謝大家！"

The Hainan Legal Week, themed ""Law-based Free Trade Portâ§Sharing New Opportunities"", brought together legal experts and representatives of enterprises from China and overseas. Addressing the opening ceremony, Dr Cheung remarked that with the official launch of the island-wide independent customs operation of the Hainan Free Trade Port in December this year, the establishment of a more flexible and efficient legal and regulatory system will be beneficial for trade and investment. He pointed out that Hong Kong can share its experiences on the construction of the rule of law, including interfaces of regulatory frameworks, foreign-related legal talent, and international economic and trade rules.

He said that Hong Kong would be happy to share its practical experiences in promoting the interface of regulatory frameworks in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in collaboration with Guangdong Province and Macao, as well as details of the measures of allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law and allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration, which have been well received by the business community, as a reference for strengthening co-operation between Hong Kong and Hainan.

Dr Cheung added that legal and other professional services are important to the free trade port development. Hong Kong is home to a rich pool offoreign-related legal talent and serves as an international legal hub. With the staunch support from the Central Government, the International Organization for Mediation is headquartered in Hong Kong. Hong Kong welcomes Hainan's arbitration and mediation institutions to establish a presence to jointly expand the market for international dispute resolution services and achieve synergistic development. The Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy can also enhance co-operation with Hainan to contribute to nurturing more high-quality foreign-related legal talent for Hainan. Additionally, with its civil and commercial laws compatible with international practice, Hong Kong is familiar with global economic and trade rules and would be ready to share its experiences with Hainan.

Upon his arrival yesterday (October 15), Dr Cheung attended a dinner with leaders of the Department of Justice of Hainan Province, and representatives from the legal and dispute resolution services sectors. This afternoon, he had lunch with leaders of the Party Committee and the Department of Justice of Hainan Province as well as the Ministry of Justice to exchange views on how Hong Kong and Hainan could jointly seize new opportunities brought about by the Hainan Free Trade Port. He then attended a meeting with leaders, including Vice Minister General of the United Front Work Department of Hainan Committe of the Communist Party of China Ms Kang Baiying,the Director-General of the Department of Justice of Hainan Province, Mr Wang Lei, and Vice President of the High People's Court of Hainan Province Ms Xia Junli, to discuss fostering legal services co-operation between Hong Kong and Hainan.

Dr Cheung said that this year marks the preparatory year for the National 15th Five-Year Plan, as well as the beginning of Hainan Province's Free Trade Port's independent customs operation and its further opening up to the world. Hong Kong's internationalised legal and other professional services talent can offer support to the development of the Hainan Free Trade Port, creating vast development opportunities for the industries. He said that Hainan and Hong Kong's complementary advantages will jointly contribute to the country's high-quality development and high-level opening up.

Tomorrow (October 17), the Hainan Legal Week will hold a seminar on the integrated development of the Hainan Free Trade Port and the GBA. The Department of Justice representative will share how the experience on the implementation of the interface of mechanisms of GBA would support the development of the Hainan Free Trade Port.

The public CHE as a percentage of GDP in 2023/24 (4.3 per cent) was 1.5 times that recorded 10 years ago in 2013/14 (2.9 per cent), increasing at a comparable rate as the growth of the proportion of the population aged 65 and above during the same period (from 14.2 per cent in mid-2013 to 21.8 per cent in mid-2023). This reflects that the ageing population is one of the key factors driving the growth in the public CHE.

  Among other regions and economies with comparable shares of elderly population, Hong Kong is one of the places with the lowest public expenditure as a percentage of GDP. At the same time, Hong Kong is one of the regions with the highest average life expectancy in the world, while maintaining an exceptionally low infant mortality rate (1.7 per 1 000 registered live births in 2024) and achieving near-universal overall immunisation coverage of all vaccines under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme among preschool children (over 97 per cent in 2024). This indicates the high efficiency and quality of Hong Kong's public healthcare system.

  It is worth noting that members of the public, in particular the elderly, rely heavily on the public healthcare system for inpatient and day inpatient services at present. Public hospitals accounted for 91.7 per cent and 95.3 per cent of the total patient days among patients of all ages and those aged 65 and above respectively. According to the Hospital Authority (HA) statistics, elderly patients' total patient days per 1 000 elderly population was 5.3 times that of non-elderly (aged below 65), and the average HA total service cost per elderly population was 4.3 times that of non-elderly population. According to the population projection figures from the Census and Statistics Department, elderly population in Hong Kong will increase from 1.64 million in mid-2023 to 2.44 million in mid-2036, and reach 2.75 million in mid-2046. With the ageing population and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, the sustainability of Hong Kong's healthcare system, particularly the public healthcare system, will face numerous challenges.

  For private healthcare expenditure, it accounted for 48.2 per cent of the CHE in Hong Kong (i.e. $121,135 million), or 4.0 per cent as a percentage of GDP, in 2023/24. Of private expenditure on secondary and tertiary healthcare, the percentage share of health insurance schemes (including privately purchased insurance schemes and employer-based insurance schemes) in private expenditure increased from 33.4 per cent to 44.8 per cent in the past decade (from 2013/14 to 2023/24) and has become an increasingly important funding source for private healthcare services. The Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) introduced by the Government in April 2019 provides members of the public with a choice of individual indemnity hospital insurance products that are subject to specific regulation with high market transparency, enhancing consumer confidence in using medical insurance. By the end of 2024, the number of VHIS policies has reached 1.428 million, which is estimated to account for approximately one-third of Hong Kong's individual indemnity hospital insurance market.

  To enhance the sustainability of Hong Kong's healthcare system, the Government is comprehensively deepening the healthcare system reform, including advancing primary healthcare development to shift the emphasis of the healthcare system from treatment-oriented to prevention-focused and enhance the role of family doctors in prevention, treatment and management of chronic diseases, thereby reducing or delaying the use of more costly secondary and tertiary healthcare services. The Government released the Primary Healthcare Blueprint in 2022 and proposed to achieve a better balance between primary and secondary/tertiary care in overall healthcare expenditure, such as around 3.5:6.5, or even 4:6 in the long run. In 2023/24, primary healthcare expenditure accounted for 29.3 per cent of the CHE in Hong Kong, which is the highest percentage in the past decade, demonstrating the Government's efforts to promote primary healthcare development are bearing fruit. At the same time, the Government is committed to taking forward the fees and charges reform for public healthcare, with a view to optimising the use of healthcare resources amidst the mounting pressure on public hospitals. In addition, the Government will also enhance the price transparency of private healthcare service, as well as encourage the optimal use of medical insurance through the VHIS, with a view to ensuring the long-term sustainable development of Hong Kong's healthcare system.

  The DHA is compiled in accordance with the guidelines given in ""A System of Health Accounts 2011"" collaboratively published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Eurostat and the World Health Organization. It classifies the overall health expenditure into four dimensions of analysis, namely Health Care Financing Schemes (HFS), Revenues of HFS, Health Care Providers and Health Care Functions. These data enable policymakers, researchers and members of the public to assess the performance of the Hong Kong health system over time and to make comparisons with other economies that adopt the same framework in calculating their health expenditure.

  The DHA 2023/24 has been uploaded to the HHB website (www.healthbureau.gov.hk/statistics/en/dha.htm). Detailed classifications and time-series data are shown in an online interactive data dashboard with tables and graphs available to facilitate further analysis and research."
醫務衞生局發表二○二三／二四年度《本地醫療衞生總開支帳目》,2025-10-16 17:50,2025-10-16 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/16/P2025101500853.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）今日（十月十六日）發表二○二三／二四年度的《本地醫療衞生總開支帳目》。《帳目》每年更新一次，有系統地顯示香港以12個月計的醫療衞生開支流向，為評估和了解香港的醫療開支水平和趨勢提供依據。

二○二三／二四年度的香港醫療衞生經常性開支為2,512.07億元，較上年度的數字（不包括2019冠狀病毒病相關開支）增加8.6%（或199.55億元），相對本地生產總值的百分比為8.3%，而人均醫療衞生經常性開支為33,334元。

二○二三／二四年度醫療衞生經常性開支中，公共醫療衞生支出佔51.8%（即1,300.72億元），相對本地生產總值的百分比為4.3%。二○二三／二四年度的百分比（4.3%），為十年前二○一三／一四年度（2.9%）的1.5倍，與同期65歲及以上人口百分比的增長率（由二○一三年年中的14.2%上升至二○二三年年中的21.8%）相若，反映人口老化是帶動有關升幅的主要因素之一。

在長者人口比例相若的其他地區及經濟體中，香港是公共開支佔本地生產總值的百分比最低的地區之一。與此同時，香港是全球平均預期壽命最高的地區之一，並保持極低的嬰兒死亡率（二○二四年按每千名登記活產嬰兒計算為1.7人），學前兒童在香港兒童免疫接種計劃下所有疫苗的整體接種率更接近全面覆蓋（二○二四年達97%以上），顯示香港公營醫療體系的高效高質。

值得留意的是，現時市民（尤其長者）高度倚賴公營醫療系統的住院及日間住院服務。在所有年齡病人和65歲及以上病人的總住院日次中，公營醫院分別佔91.7%及95.3%。根據醫院管理局（醫管局）的統計數字，每千名長者人口的病人總住院日次，是非長者（65歲以下）的5.3倍，而每名長者人口的醫管局人均服務成本為每名非長者人口的4.3倍。根據政府統計處的推算數字，香港的長者人口會由二○二三年年中的164萬，增加至二○三六年年中的244萬，並在二○四六年年中達275萬。隨着人口持續老化、慢性疾病增加，香港醫療體系，特別是公營醫療系統的可持續性將面臨不少挑戰。

至於私人醫療衞生支出方面，二○二三／二四年度的相關支出佔香港醫療衞生經常性開支48.2%（即1,211.35億元），相對本地生產總值的百分比為4.0%。在私人第二層及第三層醫療支出方面，過去十年（二○一三／一四至二○二三／二四年度）醫療保險計劃（包括私人購買的保險計劃和僱主提供的保險計劃）佔私人支出的比例，已由33.4%上升至44.8%，成為日益重要的私人醫療服務資金來源。政府於二○一九年四月推出的自願醫保計劃，為公眾提供一種受特定規範、市場透明度高的個人償款住院保險產品選擇，讓消費者更有信心使用醫療保險。截至二○二四年年底，自願醫保計劃保單已達142.8萬張，估計在全港個人償款住院保險市場的佔比約為三分之一。

為提升香港醫療體系的可持續性，政府正全面深化醫療體系改革，包括積極發展基層醫療，以扭轉「重治療、輕預防」的醫療體系，更好發揮家庭醫生預防、診治和管理慢性疾病的作用，減少或推遲使用費用較高昂的第二層及第三層醫療服務。政府於二○二二年公布《基層醫療健康藍圖》，提出在整體醫療開支中，基層醫療和第二層／第三層醫療之間應達致較佳平衡，例如約3.5:6.5，甚至4:6的長遠目標。在二○二三／二四年度香港醫療衞生經常性開支中，基層醫療開支佔29.3%，為過去十年最高，顯示政府推動基層醫療發展的工作已漸見成效。與此同時，政府亦致力推展公營醫療收費改革，在公立醫院壓力日趨沉重的時候更好運用醫療資源，並提高私營醫療服務收費透明度，透過自願醫保計劃鼓勵善用醫療保險，確保香港醫療體系行穩致遠。

《帳目》是根據經濟合作與發展組織、歐洲聯盟統計局和世界衞生組織合作出版的《醫療衞生總開支帳目系統2011》所載國際指引編製而成，以「醫療融資計劃」、「醫療融資計劃收入」、「醫護服務提供單位」和「醫護服務功能」四個分析範圍作分類。這些數據讓政策制定者、研究人員和公眾能夠評估香港醫療系統在一段時間內的表現，也能用之與其他採用相同框架計算醫療衞生開支的經濟體進行比較。

二○二三／二四年度的《帳目》已上載於醫衞局網頁（www.healthbureau.gov.hk/statistics/cn/dha.htm）。詳細的分類和時間序列數據以互動數據儀表板形式顯示，並提供圖表以便利作進一步分析和研究。"

Updated annually, the DHA provides a systematic description of the flow of health expenditure in Hong Kong over a 12-month period, forming a basis for assessing and understanding the levels and trends of health spending in Hong Kong.

  The Current Health Expenditure (CHE) in Hong Kong in 2023/24 was $251,207 million, representing an increase of 8.6 per cent (or $19,955 million) compared with the previous year's figure (excluding identified COVID-19 expenditure). The CHE as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 8.3 per cent, and the CHE per capita was $33,334.
