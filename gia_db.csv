一名三十七歲的男旅客昨日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在其寄艙行李內發現該批懷疑大麻花，該名人士隨即被捕。

被捕男子已被控以一項販運危險藥物罪，案件明日（七月二日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑販毒活動。"
Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected cannabis buds worth about $1.5 million at airport (with photo),2025-07-01 14:12,2025-07-01 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/01/P2025070100369.htm,"âHong Kong Customs yesterday (June 30) detected a drug trafficking case involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport and seized about 7 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $1.5 million.

A male passenger, aged 37, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds inside his check-in suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (July 2).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Distinguished guests, fellow citizens,

Today marks the 28th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China and the third anniversary of the current term of the Government. Over these three years, the Government has forged ahead with reforms to build a safe and stable Hong Kong, and striven to develop the economy and improve people's livelihood. Our efforts are gradually delivering results.

I have changed the culture of the Government and formed a ""result-oriented"" Government. We have fulfilled the constitutional duty by enacting the local legislation for Article 23 of the Basic Law, a historic task long envisioned by previous terms of the Government but unrealised until now. We have rebuilt a safe Hong Kong. This year, Hong Kong is ranked seventh globally in the safety index.

The Government has spared no efforts in addressing land and housing issues. The waiting time for public housing has been shortened by about nine and a half months, from 6.1 years to 5.3 years. In our combat against the abuse of public rental housing resources, another 8700 or so housing units have been recovered, equivalent to about 11 public housing blocks and a saving of around $8.7billion in construction costs. We have acted swiftly to build Light Public Housing for intake by over 9 500 households within this year, relieving the imminent housing needs of more than 9 500 families.

Since we assumed office, Hong Kong's economy has shifted from negative to positive growth. Median monthly household income during the period has risen by $3,000, an increase of over 11 per cent. We attach great importance on labour rights. The abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund offsetting arrangement has taken effect, and the review cycle of the Statutory Minimum Wage has now been revised from every two years to every year.

We have strengthened mutual market access, relaxed the listing requirements for biotechnology and specialist technology companies, established a licensing regime for stablecoin and simplified listing procedures, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of the financial sector. Hong Kong has climbed up one place in its ranking as a financial centre and secured the third place globally.

We have endeavoured to trawl for talent, compete for enterprises, and attract companies and investment to Hong Kong. Over 210 000 professionals, top talent and quality migrants have arrived in Hong Kong, boosting the city's competitiveness. We have attracted 84 strategic enterprises from frontier technological industries to Hong Kong, bringing in investment amounting to some $50 billion and creating over 20 000 job opportunities. We have simplified the regime for company re-domiciliation, with two major global insurance companies readily expressing their interest in re-domiciling to Hong Kong. Hong Kong's global position in the World Competitiveness Yearbook has improved for two consecutive years, rising from the seventh to the third place. For World Talent Ranking, Hong Kong has returned to the top ten, climbing up seven places to the ninth position.

Amid economic restructuring, Hong Kong is faced with challenges as well as opportunities. With the advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the challenges we face would be outweighed by the opportunities available to us. Looking ahead, our major tasks will cover three areas:

First, to safeguard high-quality development with high-level security. We will actively co-ordinate the coherence between security and development. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong will remain steadfast in maintaining national security, fully seize national opportunities and proactively integrate into the overall national development, with a view to fostering economic growth and development while assisting enterprises in upgrading their operations and expanding domestic and overseas sales markets. We will deepen international exchanges and co-operation, explore new markets and opportunities, bolster the provision of extensive supply chain services, expand and strengthen regional trade with the aim of offsetting the risk of over-reliance on a single market in business trade. In addition to dedicating our efforts to the development of innovation and technology and expanding digital trade and supporting the development of local enterprises, we will introduce new technologies and industries, and continue to compete for talent and enterprises, further securing our position as an international financial, shipping and trade centre.

Second, to speed up the development of the Northern Metropolis. The Northern Metropolis, which takes up around one-third of Hong Kong's area and will later accommodate one-third of our population, is a new engine for the development of Hong Kong. By introducing new concepts and new methods, removing potential barriers and leveraging market forces, we aim to enhance the speed and efficiency of developing the Northern Metropolis, the San Tin Technopole, and the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone. With a focus on industry development and innovative technology, our goal is to attract scientific research talent from around the world and concentrate innovation resources, in order to promote the establishment of Hong Kong as a hub for high-calibre talent and drive the overall development of Hong Kong.

Third, to improve people's livelihood proactively. Our policy objective is to make Hong Kong a better place for living and working – for people to enjoy better living and accommodation, for young people to fully realise their potential, and for the elderly to be well taken care of.

The HKSAR Government will sustain its efforts in improving people's livelihood in such aspects as housing, medical health, education and welfare, thus enhancing people's quality of life. We will remain committed to accelerating the supply of public housing to further reduce the waiting time, and ensure the timely provision of Light Public Housing to meet pressing demand. The registration of compliant Basic Housing Units, which will replace substandard subdivided units, is expected to begin in March next year. The Government will continue to deepen the reform of the healthcare system and improve public and primary healthcare services. We will remain committed to the strategy of targeted poverty alleviation, focusing on directing resources to those most in need. On transportation, the Government will take forward the implementation of the Hong Kong Major Transport Infrastructure Development Blueprint, pressing ahead with various railway projects, including the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link connecting Hung Shui Kiu and Qianhai, the Northern Link Spur Line, as well as local smart and green mass transit systems.

As a Chinese saying goes, ""Is there anything too hard in the world? With determined efforts, a hard task becomes easy; otherwise, an easy job may become difficult"". We would rather be reformers who rise to challenges than become complacent idlers. Amid an everâchanging geopolitical landscape and constantly increasing uncertainties, Hong Kong is able to showcase exactly to the world the certainties of safety, stability and development opportunities. These are precisely what the world needs and seeks. Hong Kong is a place where national and global opportunities converge. As long as we are determined to fully seize the opportunities, keep enhancing our value and competiveness, undertake reforms for progress and foster innovation, I am confident the wisdom and experience of the people of Hong Kong will help our Pearl of the Orient shine brighter than ever on the world stage! Thank you."

各位嘉賓、各位市民：

今日是中華人民共和國香港特別行政區成立二十八周年的大日子，也是本屆政府上任的三周年。三年來，政府推動改革，我們建立了安全和穩定的香港，我們發展經濟、改善民生，陸續見到成果。

我改變了政府文化，建立以結果為目標的政府。我們完成了《基本法》第二十三條本地立法的憲制責任，完成歷屆政府想做而未能達成的歷史任務，我們重建一個安全的香港；今年在最安全城市排名裏面，香港排名全球第七。

我們全力處理土地房屋問題：公屋輪候時間由6.1年下降至5.3年，縮短約九個半月；打擊濫用公屋，多收回約8 700個單位，等於近11座公屋，等同省回約87億元建築費；我們快速興建「簡約公屋」，今年會有約9 500戶入伙，讓9 500個家庭即時解困。

本屆政府上任以來，香港經濟由負增長轉為正增長，家庭收入以中位數計增加三千元，上升超過百分之十一。我們重視勞工權益，落實取消強積金「對沖」，最低工資由「兩年一檢」改為「一年一檢」。

我們強化互聯互通，協助生物科技和特專科技公司上市，制定穩定幣發牌制度，優化了上市程序，提升金融競爭力。香港的金融中心地位上升一位，穩居世界第三。

我們着力搶人才、搶企業、招商引資，已經抵港的專才、高才、優才超過21萬人，有助提升香港競爭力。我們引進了84間從事前沿科技的重點企業，帶來約500億港元投資，創造超過2萬個職位。我們簡化公司遷冊機制，兩間國際保險大行即時表示會遷冊香港。香港的世界競爭力排名連續兩年上升，由世界第七升至世界第三，人才競爭力排名重回十大，上升七位至世界第九。

香港正值經濟轉型期，面對着挑戰和機遇。在「一國兩制」之下的優勢，香港機遇大於挑戰。展望未來，我們的重點工作會在三方面：

第一，以高水平安全護航高質量發展。我們會統籌好安全和發展。在「一國兩制」下，我們會堅定維護國家安全，並把握國家機遇，積極融入國家發展大局，全力拼經濟、謀發展，幫助企業升級轉型，拓展內外銷市場；我們會深化國際交往合作，開拓新市場、新機遇，強化全供應鏈服務，做大、做深區域貿易，抵銷過分依賴單一市場的貿易風險。我們會大力發展科技創新，擴大數字貿易，推動本地企業發展，同時引進技術和產業，繼續搶人才、搶企業，鞏固國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位。

第二，加快發展北部都會區。北部都會區佔香港面積約三分之一，人口亦將佔三分之一，是香港發展的新引擎。我們會引入新理念、新辦法，拆牆鬆綁，結合市場力量，提速提效，加快發展北部都會區、新田科技城、河套深港科技創新合作區的香港園區，以產業發展為重點考慮，以創新科技為核心，吸引全球科研人才和創新資源集聚，促進高端人才集聚高地建設，帶動香港整體發展。

第三，着力改善民生。我施政的目標，是讓市民有更好的生活、更好的居所，青年有更好的發展，長者有更好的照顧，市民安居樂業。

特區政府會持續在住屋、醫療、教育和福利等方面改善民生，提升市民生活質素。我們會繼續加快公營房屋供應，進一步縮短公屋輪候時間；確保「簡約公屋」如期供應，以解燃眉之急；取締「劏房」的合規「簡樸房」有望明年三月開始進行登記。政府會繼續深化醫療體系改革，加強公營和基層醫療服務。我們會繼續實踐精準扶貧理念，聚焦幫助排在隊尾最需要幫助的人。在交通方面，政府會推進落實運輸基建發展藍圖，全力推動各鐵路項目，包括洪水橋至前海的港深西部鐵路、北環線支線和區內智慧綠色集體運輸系統等。

常言道：「天下事有難易乎？為之，則難者亦易矣；不為，則易者亦難矣」。我們寧願做艱難的改革者，都不能做安逸的停滯者。現今地緣政治風雲變幻，不確定性不斷增加，香港可提供給世界的正正是安全和發展的確定性。這些確定性是現今世界需要和渴求的。國家機遇和世界機遇都圍繞着香港，只要我們把握好機遇，不斷提升自身價值和競爭力，改革求進，創新創造，憑着香港人的智慧和經驗，我有信心，東方之珠一定能夠在世界舞台上綻放更耀眼的光芒！多謝大家。"

各位嘉賓、各位市民：

今日是中華人民共和國香港特別行政區成立二十八周年的大日子，也是本屆政府上任的三周年。三年來，政府推動改革，我們建立了安全和穩定的香港，我們發展經濟、改善民生，陸續見到成果。

我改變了政府文化，建立以結果為目標的政府。我們完成了《基本法》第二十三條本地立法的憲制責任，完成歷屆政府想做而未能達成的歷史任務，我們重建一個安全的香港；今年在最安全城市排名裏面，香港排名全球第七。

我們全力處理土地房屋問題：公屋輪候時間由6.1年下降至5.3年，縮短約九個半月；打擊濫用公屋，多收回約8 700個單位，等於近11座公屋，等同省回約87億元建築費；我們快速興建「簡約公屋」，今年會有約9 500戶入伙，讓9 500個家庭即時解困。

本屆政府上任以來，香港經濟由負增長轉為正增長，家庭收入以中位數計增加三千元，上升超過百分之十一。我們重視勞工權益，落實取消強積金「對沖」，最低工資由「兩年一檢」改為「一年一檢」。

我們強化互聯互通，協助生物科技和特專科技公司上市，制定穩定幣發牌制度，優化了上市程序，提升金融競爭力。香港的金融中心地位上升一位，穩居世界第三。

我們着力搶人才、搶企業、招商引資，已經抵港的專才、高才、優才超過21萬人，有助提升香港競爭力。我們引進了84間從事前沿科技的重點企業，帶來約500億港元投資，創造超過2萬個職位。我們簡化公司遷冊機制，兩間國際保險大行即時表示會遷冊香港。香港的世界競爭力排名連續兩年上升，由世界第七升至世界第三，人才競爭力排名重回十大，上升七位至世界第九。

香港正值經濟轉型期，面對着挑戰和機遇。在「一國兩制」之下的優勢，香港機遇大於挑戰。展望未來，我們的重點工作會在三方面：

第一，以高水平安全護航高質量發展。我們會統籌好安全和發展。在「一國兩制」下，我們會堅定維護國家安全，並把握國家機遇，積極融入國家發展大局，全力拼經濟、謀發展，幫助企業升級轉型，拓展內外銷市場；我們會深化國際交往合作，開拓新市場、新機遇，強化全供應鏈服務，做大、做深區域貿易，抵銷過分依賴單一市場的貿易風險。我們會大力發展科技創新，擴大數字貿易，推動本地企業發展，同時引進技術和產業，繼續搶人才、搶企業，鞏固國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位。

第二，加快發展北部都會區。北部都會區佔香港面積約三分之一，人口亦將佔三分之一，是香港發展的新引擎。我們會引入新理念、新辦法，拆牆鬆綁，結合市場力量，提速提效，加快發展北部都會區、新田科技城、河套深港科技創新合作區的香港園區，以產業發展為重點考慮，以創新科技為核心，吸引全球科研人才和創新資源集聚，促進高端人才集聚高地建設，帶動香港整體發展。

第三，着力改善民生。我施政的目標，是讓市民有更好的生活、更好的居所，青年有更好的發展，長者有更好的照顧，市民安居樂業。

特區政府會持續在住屋、醫療、教育和福利等方面改善民生，提升市民生活質素。我們會繼續加快公營房屋供應，進一步縮短公屋輪候時間；確保「簡約公屋」如期供應，以解燃眉之急；取締「劏房」的合規「簡樸房」有望明年三月開始進行登記。政府會繼續深化醫療體系改革，加強公營和基層醫療服務。我們會繼續實踐精準扶貧理念，聚焦幫助排在隊尾最需要幫助的人。在交通方面，政府會推進落實運輸基建發展藍圖，全力推動各鐵路項目，包括洪水橋至前海的港深西部鐵路、北環線支線和區內智慧綠色集體運輸系統等。

常言道：「天下事有難易乎？為之，則難者亦易矣；不為，則易者亦難矣」。我們寧願做艱難的改革者，都不能做安逸的停滯者。現今地緣政治風雲變幻，不確定性不斷增加，香港可提供給世界的正正是安全和發展的確定性。這些確定性是現今世界需要和渴求的。國家機遇和世界機遇都圍繞着香港，只要我們把握好機遇，不斷提升自身價值和競爭力，改革求進，創新創造，憑着香港人的智慧和經驗，我有信心，東方之珠一定能夠在世界舞台上綻放更耀眼的光芒！多謝大家。"
Speech by CE at reception in celebration of 28th anniversary of establishment of HKSAR (with photos),2025-07-01 09:48,2025-07-01 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/01/P2025070100247.htm,"âFollowing is the translation of the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the reception in celebration of the 28th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre this morning (July 1):

Distinguished guests, fellow citizens,

Today marks the 28th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China and the third anniversary of the current term of the Government. Over these three years, the Government has forged ahead with reforms to build a safe and stable Hong Kong, and striven to develop the economy and improve people's livelihood. Our efforts are gradually delivering results.

I have changed the culture of the Government and formed a ""result-oriented"" Government. We have fulfilled the constitutional duty by enacting the local legislation for Article 23 of the Basic Law, a historic task long envisioned by previous terms of the Government but unrealised until now. We have rebuilt a safe Hong Kong. This year, Hong Kong is ranked seventh globally in the safety index.

The Government has spared no efforts in addressing land and housing issues. The waiting time for public housing has been shortened by about nine and a half months, from 6.1 years to 5.3 years. In our combat against the abuse of public rental housing resources, another 8700 or so housing units have been recovered, equivalent to about 11 public housing blocks and a saving of around $8.7billion in construction costs. We have acted swiftly to build Light Public Housing for intake by over 9 500 households within this year, relieving the imminent housing needs of more than 9 500 families.

Since we assumed office, Hong Kong's economy has shifted from negative to positive growth. Median monthly household income during the period has risen by $3,000, an increase of over 11 per cent. We attach great importance on labour rights. The abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund offsetting arrangement has taken effect, and the review cycle of the Statutory Minimum Wage has now been revised from every two years to every year.

We have strengthened mutual market access, relaxed the listing requirements for biotechnology and specialist technology companies, established a licensing regime for stablecoin and simplified listing procedures, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of the financial sector. Hong Kong has climbed up one place in its ranking as a financial centre and secured the third place globally.

We have endeavoured to trawl for talent, compete for enterprises, and attract companies and investment to Hong Kong. Over 210 000 professionals, top talent and quality migrants have arrived in Hong Kong, boosting the city's competitiveness. We have attracted 84 strategic enterprises from frontier technological industries to Hong Kong, bringing in investment amounting to some $50 billion and creating over 20 000 job opportunities. We have simplified the regime for company re-domiciliation, with two major global insurance companies readily expressing their interest in re-domiciling to Hong Kong. Hong Kong's global position in the World Competitiveness Yearbook has improved for two consecutive years, rising from the seventh to the third place. For World Talent Ranking, Hong Kong has returned to the top ten, climbing up seven places to the ninth position.

Amid economic restructuring, Hong Kong is faced with challenges as well as opportunities. With the advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the challenges we face would be outweighed by the opportunities available to us. Looking ahead, our major tasks will cover three areas:

First, to safeguard high-quality development with high-level security. We will actively co-ordinate the coherence between security and development. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong will remain steadfast in maintaining national security, fully seize national opportunities and proactively integrate into the overall national development, with a view to fostering economic growth and development while assisting enterprises in upgrading their operations and expanding domestic and overseas sales markets. We will deepen international exchanges and co-operation, explore new markets and opportunities, bolster the provision of extensive supply chain services, expand and strengthen regional trade with the aim of offsetting the risk of over-reliance on a single market in business trade. In addition to dedicating our efforts to the development of innovation and technology and expanding digital trade and supporting the development of local enterprises, we will introduce new technologies and industries, and continue to compete for talent and enterprises, further securing our position as an international financial, shipping and trade centre.

Second, to speed up the development of the Northern Metropolis. The Northern Metropolis, which takes up around one-third of Hong Kong's area and will later accommodate one-third of our population, is a new engine for the development of Hong Kong. By introducing new concepts and new methods, removing potential barriers and leveraging market forces, we aim to enhance the speed and efficiency of developing the Northern Metropolis, the San Tin Technopole, and the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone. With a focus on industry development and innovative technology, our goal is to attract scientific research talent from around the world and concentrate innovation resources, in order to promote the establishment of Hong Kong as a hub for high-calibre talent and drive the overall development of Hong Kong.

Third, to improve people's livelihood proactively. Our policy objective is to make Hong Kong a better place for living and working – for people to enjoy better living and accommodation, for young people to fully realise their potential, and for the elderly to be well taken care of.

The HKSAR Government will sustain its efforts in improving people's livelihood in such aspects as housing, medical health, education and welfare, thus enhancing people's quality of life. We will remain committed to accelerating the supply of public housing to further reduce the waiting time, and ensure the timely provision of Light Public Housing to meet pressing demand. The registration of compliant Basic Housing Units, which will replace substandard subdivided units, is expected to begin in March next year. The Government will continue to deepen the reform of the healthcare system and improve public and primary healthcare services. We will remain committed to the strategy of targeted poverty alleviation, focusing on directing resources to those most in need. On transportation, the Government will take forward the implementation of the Hong Kong Major Transport Infrastructure Development Blueprint, pressing ahead with various railway projects, including the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link connecting Hung Shui Kiu and Qianhai, the Northern Link Spur Line, as well as local smart and green mass transit systems.

As a Chinese saying goes, ""Is there anything too hard in the world? With determined efforts, a hard task becomes easy; otherwise, an easy job may become difficult"". We would rather be reformers who rise to challenges than become complacent idlers. Amid an everâchanging geopolitical landscape and constantly increasing uncertainties, Hong Kong is able to showcase exactly to the world the certainties of safety, stability and development opportunities. These are precisely what the world needs and seeks. Hong Kong is a place where national and global opportunities converge. As long as we are determined to fully seize the opportunities, keep enhancing our value and competiveness, undertake reforms for progress and foster innovation, I am confident the wisdom and experience of the people of Hong Kong will help our Pearl of the Orient shine brighter than ever on the world stage! Thank you."

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, extends his congratulations to all award recipients and expresses gratitude for their significant contributions, hoping that they will continue to excel in their own fields and serve the community.

Mr Lee said, ""I also express my gratitude to nine officers for their outstanding contributions to safeguarding national security. In the situation facing targeted malicious attacks from external forces, they have remained fearlessly committed to duty and displayed an extraordinary level of determination in discharging their duties, and actively participated in work related to the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. They deserve the honours as recognition of their significant contributions.

""Regarding the No. 3 alarm fire at New Lucky House in Jordan, which led to multiple deaths and injuries on April 10 last year, I would like to thank two citizens who bravely saved a number of trapped people, and therefore awarded the Medal for Bravery (Bronze) to these two citizens.

  ""I also take this opportunity to express my thanks for the contributions of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region search and rescue team deployed to assist in the search and rescue work in the quake-stricken areas in Myanmar in March and April this year, and therefore awarded the Chief Executive's Commendation for Community Service and the Chief Executive's Commendation for Government/Public Service to these officers.""

僱主／承建商及僱員須注意在暴雨下工作時的電力安全,2025-06-30 23:58,2025-07-01 00:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000968.htm,"鑑於天文台已發出暴雨警告，勞工處提醒僱主及承建商，當僱員在進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置時，須採取所需的工作安排及適當安全措施，以保障僱員的工作安全。

勞工處發言人今日（六月三十日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-06-30 23:58,2025-07-01 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000970.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (June 30) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

"EDB holds first ""Digital Education Week 2025"" kick-off ceremony with EdCity to enlighten future talents with innovative education (with photos)",2025-06-30 23:27,2025-06-30 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000893.htm,"The first ""Digital Education Week 2025"" kick-off ceremony was held in Central Government Offices today (June 30) with the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hong Kong Education City Limited (EdCity) , Mr Armstrong Lee Hon-cheung, etc to officiate and launch the one-week annual grand event of education. The Education Bureau (EDB) also announced that the first batch of deliverables including the three projects under the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme funded by a provision of $500 million from the Quality Education Fund (QEF) are released today. The EdCity also signed co-operation agreements with a technology firm and two local technology professional bodies as witnessed by Dr Choi, further promoting local development in digital education.

The officiating guests of the launching ceremony include Dr Choi, the First-level Inspector of the Department of Educational, Scientific and Technological Affairs of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Liu Maozhou, the Permanent Secretary for Education, Ms Michelle Li, the Under Secretary for Education, Dr Sze Chun-fai, Deputy Secretary for Education, Dr Gloria Chan, Mr Armstrong Lee Hon-cheung, the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR), Dr Anissa Chan Wong Lai-kuen, the Founder and Honorary President and the chairwoman of the Steering Committee of the Smart City Consortium, the Hon Elizabeth Quat and the Chairman of the QEF Steering Committee, Mr Dieter Yih Lai-tak, witnessing an important milestone of digital education development in Hong Kong together.

To dovetail with the national development of digital education and to nurture talents for the innovation and technology (I&T) sector, the Chief Executive announced the formation of the Steering Committee on Strategic Development of Digital Education in the 2024 Policy Address. The Committee has identified four key focuses and strategic directions, namely to enhance students' digital literacy and skills, to strengthen professional training in digital education for teachers, to optimise digital education ancillary infrastructure, as well as to strengthen ties between local, Mainland and international innovation and technology institutions, tertiary institutions, and relevant sectors to enhance synergy and promote high-quality development of digital education. The EDB has rolled out a series of activities, including organising multiple engagement sessions with stakeholders to gauge views on the development of digital education in the schools in Hong Kong. The Committee members also conducted school visits to understand of the latest progress of the implementation of digital education in schools.

Speaking at the kick-off ceremony of the Digital Education Week, Dr Choi said, ""the first Digital Education Week features a wide range of enriching programmes, including the annual flagship event for the education sector, Learning & Teaching Expo 2025, as well as the International Summit on the Use of AI in Learning and Teaching Languages and Other Subjects and Post-Summit Workshop Series. These functions enable teachers to stay abreast of the latest developments in I&T and digital education, fostering professional exchanges and enhancing the effectiveness of learning and teaching. As a close partner of the EDB, the EdCity is stepping up its full efforts to promote digital education and continues to leverage on its advantages to promote the application and education of AI and computational thinking, and enhancing students' digital literacy and skills."" Dr Choi looked forward to working in collaboration with the community to promote the deep integration of I&T and nurture more I&T talent, thereby contributing to the building of a leading country in education and a strong nation in science and technology.

The Learning & Teaching Expo 2025 will bring together global educational technology resources, set up nearly 600 booths, and host more than 270 keynote speeches, seminars and public demonstration classes to fully showcase the latest teaching solutions and technology trends. While the International Summit on AIinLT will gather education experts from home and abroad to discuss the practical application of AI in various disciplines through 100 paper presentations, teaching demonstrations and 11 in-depth workshops, helping teachers and students enhance their AI literacy.

Mr Lee said, ""The Digital Education Week is not just an event, it is an important milestone in shaping the future of education in Hong Kong. As a wholly owned government organisation, the EdCity has been committed to promoting information technology education in Hong Kong, providing an interactive learning platform for teachers, students and parents, and contributing diversified resources and support to enhance teaching effectiveness, promote holistic development and lifelong learning. This year's expo has newly added a Mainland China Zone, an International Pavilion and an I&T Exchange Circle. The EdCity hopes to further expand the AI education ecosystem to Mainland China and overseas, presenting the most novel and effective innovative education solutions and products from around the world to the Hong Kong education sector, and enhancing the quality of learning and teaching.""

At the event, the EDB announced that the first batch of three deliverables in the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme, which was funded by a provision of $500 million from the QEF, are officially rolled out today. The deliverables of the projects will also be exhibited at the Learning & Teaching Expo 2025 for teachers and students to experience. The programme provides 22 innovative e-learning solutions for primary and secondary, kindergarten and special education students in Hong Kong, 18 of which incorporate AI technology. Three of the project leaders briefed the guests on the functions and vision of the projects.

Dr Anissa Chan said, ""Schools and teachers have a key role to play in guiding students to use and control new technologies in an orderly and appropriate manner, rather than being controlled by them. Therefore, while embracing innovative technologies, the education sector should also be equipped with the skills to utilise AI. The inaugural International Summit on the Use of AI in Learning and Teaching Languages and Other Subjects & Post-Summit Workshop Series, co-organised by the EDB, SCOLAR, EdCity, and the Department of English and Communication of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, aims to provide a valuable platform for teachers, researchers and others in the education sector to learn from each other and to share their own insights on the use of AI in the education sector"".

In addition, witnessed by Dr Choi and Mr Lee, the Executive Director of EdCity, Dr Tenny Lam, signed cooperation agreements with the Association of I.T. Leaders in Education (AiTLE), Hong Kong Qianfan Technology and the Hong Kong Association for Computer Education (HKACE) respectively to further promote the development of digital education in Hong Kong. The EDB praised the HKACE and the AiTLE for their contributions to the development of digital education over the years, and also thanked Hong Kong Qianfan Technology and the EdCity for their collaboration to launch innovative projects to support digital education, with a view to introducing innovative technologies to the academic sector and helping the digital transformation of education."
HKSAR Government strongly condemns smears and attacks against the Hong Kong National Security Law,2025-06-30 23:19,2025-06-30 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000925.htm,"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (June 30) strongly condemned and opposed the malicious attacks on and thedemonisation of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and other laws safeguarding national security, as well as the slanderous and fact-distorting remarks made on the HKSAR's work in safeguarding national security by foreign politicians, anti-China organisations, and various media outlets on the important occasion of the fifth anniversary of the promulgation and implementation of the HKNSL.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government pointed out, ""These anti-China and destabilising forces, organisations or media have made sweepingly generalised and grandstanding comments, completely disregarding the profound historical significance of the HKNSL and its undeniable positive impact on the HKSAR. They distorted the facts and made slanderous remarks on the HKSAR and the HKNSL. They even attempted to interfere with criminal trials conducted in HKSAR courts, thereby obstructing the course of justice. On the contrary, they never utter a word about the strict enforcement of national security laws by their own countries and other governments against activities that endanger their national security. This is an entirely despicable political manipulation, and we must sternly denounce their wrongdoing to set the record straight and to expose their shameless 'double standards' to the world.""

Positive effects of laws safeguarding national security

The spokesman emphasised, ""Safeguarding national security is a top priority of every country. In accordance with international law and international relations based on the Charter of the United Nations, It is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. Acts and activities endangering national security could bring very serious consequences. Prompt actions must be taken to prevent and suppress such acts and activities effectively. No country will watch with folded arms and tolerate any of such acts and activities endangering national security without taking any action. Any acts of disregarding the facts and smearing HKSAR's work in safeguarding national security with untruthful remarks are hypocritical and irresponsible, and will not win any public support.""

""For a considerable period, external forces, through their agents, have conducted infiltration and sabotage activities in Hong Kong, and further instigated the 'black-clad violence' and the Hong Kong version of 'colour revolution' in 2019, which nearly brought the 'one country, two systems' to ruin. With the promulgation and implementation of the HKNSL, its effect in stopping violence and curbing disorder as well as quickly restoring social stability in the Hong Kong community was immediate. The HKSAR fulfilled its constitutional duty by enacting the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) last year with broad societal consensus, thereby improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. This has enabled Hong Kong's transition 'from chaos to order' and advancement 'from stability to prosperity'.""

""The attempts by external forces to 'use Hong Kong to contain China' are doomed to fail, leaving them with no option but to smear the HKNSL. However, the facts are clear for all to see, and both Hong Kong citizens and international investors have a discerning eye. Over five years of its implementation, the HKNSL has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence', and has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly return to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. According to the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres and comes fourth in initial public offering in the world. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security. They also provide investors and businesses worldwide with ample confidence to develop their operations in Hong Kong and leverage on Hong Kong's institutional advantages under 'one country, two systems' to explore the vast mainland China market, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.""

Protection of rights and freedoms

The spokesman said, ""As a matter of fact, human rights in Hong Kong have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. Article 4 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law.""

""Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, many of the rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that certain rights and freedoms including the freedom of expression may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc.""

""In fact, the courts have clarified the boundaries of exercising freedoms and rights. The Court of Appeal's judgment in the Tam Tak-chi case affirmed that when the definition of 'seditious intention' is read correctly in conjunction with the fundamental right to freedom of expression, it clearly shows that criticising the Government, the administration of justice including judgments of courts, or engaging in debates about or raising objections to Government policies or decisions, however strong, vigorous or critical they may be, does not constitute a 'seditious intention'. This provides further clarity in differentiating between lawful and unlawful speeches.""

Rule of law is strong and robust

The spokesman stressed, ""The rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and robust, and withstands the test of time. Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly provide that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing, and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. A person who commits an act which constitutes an offence under the law shall be convicted and punished in accordance with the law. No one shall be convicted and punished for an act which does not constitute an offence under the law. A person is presumed innocent until convicted by a judicial body. The right to defend and other rights in judicial proceedings that a criminal suspect, defendant, and other parties in judicial proceedings entitled to under the law shall be protected.""

""The offences endangering national security stipulated by the HKNSL and SNSO target acts endangering national security with precision, and define the elements and penalties of the offences with clarity. The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation.""

""The Department of Justice, by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law, controls criminal prosecutions, makes independent prosecutorial decisions in accordance with the law, free from any interference. Prosecutions would be instituted by the Department of Justice only if there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction, and if it is in the public interest to do so.""

Fair and timely trial

The spokesman also pointed out, ""As guaranteed by the Basic Law, the HKNSL and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, all defendants charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to a fair trial by the Judiciary exercising independent judicial power. The courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference.""

""In handling cases concerning offences endangering national security, the Judiciary, the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies strictly comply with Article 42(1) of the HKNSL, which stipulates that 'the law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Region shall ensure that cases concerning offences endangering national security are handled in a fair and timely manner'. The time taken between the institution of prosecution and the trial of each case depends on a multitude of factors, such as whether further investigation is required, whether the defendant needs time to obtain legal advice for consideration of his/her plea, whether the defence requires translated documents or whether the defence exercises rights under the law to make any pre-trial application, etc. All applications are handled in accordance with established procedures and due process is fully observed.""

Regarding the case of Lai Chee-ying

The spokesperson emphasised, ""Recently, foreign politicians, anti-China organisations, and various media have continued to make irresponsible and absurd remarks, distorting the truth regarding the national security case involving Lai Chee-ying, as well as his custodial arrangements, with the intention of perverting the course of justice. The HKSAR government has repeatedly pointed out that any attempt by any country, organisation, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power, to prevent any defendant from receiving a fair trial that they should have, is a blatant act undermining the rule of law of Hong Kong and should be condemned. The suggestion that persons or organisations with certain backgrounds should be immune from legal sanctions for their illegal acts and activities is tantamount to granting such persons or organisations privileges to break the law, perverting the course of justice, and is totally contrary to the spirit of the rule of law. The HKSAR Government strongly urges any external forces to immediately stop interfering with the HKSAR's internal affairs and the independent exercise of judicial power by the courts of the HKSAR.""

""Regarding the custodial arrangements of Lai Chee-ying, the HKSAR Government reiterates that the Correctional Services Department (CSD) is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and has put in place an established mechanism to safeguard the rights of persons-in-custody (PICs), including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected. The CSD consistently handles matters concerning Lai Chee-ying strictly in accordance with these mechanisms, no differently from other PICs. In the interests of a particular prisoner or for the maintenance of good order and discipline, the Commissioner of Correctional Services is empowered to make arrangements under section 68B of the Prison Rules that such prisoner should not associate with other prisoners (i.e. the so-called 'solitary confinement'). One of the purposes of the relevant arrangement is to ensure the personal safety and well-being of the PIC, which can be requested by the PIC themselves and approved by the Commissioner after considering the matter in accordance with the law; or the Commissioner may make such arrangements after considering the relevant factors in accordance with the legal requirements and procedures. It must be clarified that the arrangement for Lai Chee-ying's removal from association with other PICs has been made at his own request and approved by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law all along. Lai Chee-ying's legal representative has also publicly clarified that he is receiving appropriate treatment and care in prison. Yet, many anti-China forces who make irresponsible remarks about Lai Chee-ying's case, while claiming to 'defend press freedom', have continuously fabricated and distorted facts regarding his custodial arrangements and health conditions. This is indeed a desecration of press freedom.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""The HKSAR Government will continue to uphold its constitutional duty and steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests. It will continue to resolutely fulfill its duties and obligations to safeguard national security while simultaneously protecting the lawful rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents and others in Hong Kong in accordance with the law. By ensuring high-quality development with high-level security, a new chapter in the practice of 'one country, two systems' would be continuously composed."""

「學與教博覽2025」將匯聚全球教育科技資源，設近600個展位，並舉辦逾270場主題演講、研討會及公開示範課，全方位展示最新教學方案與科技趨勢。「AIinLT國際高峰會」則雲集海內外教育專家，透過100場論文發表、教學示範及11場深度工作坊，探討人工智能於各學科的實踐應用，助力師生提升人工智能素養。

李漢祥表示：「『數字教育周』不僅是一場活動，更是塑造香港教育未來的重要里程碑。作為政府全資擁有的機構，教育城一直致力於推進香港的信息科技教育，為教師、學生和家長提供互動的學習平台，並提供多元化的資源和支援，以提升教學效能、促進全人發展和終身學習。今年博覽新增設中國內地專區、國際展館及創科交流圈，教育城期望能將人工智能教育生態圈，進一步擴充至中國內地及海外，為香港教育界呈獻世界各地最新穎和有效的創新教育方案及產品，提升學與教質量。」

同場，教育局宣布由優質教育基金撥備五億港元推行的「電子學習配套計劃」，首批交付成果共三個項目於今日正式發布，有關方案亦會於「學與教博覽2025」中展出供師生親身體驗。該計劃為全港中、小學、幼稚園及特殊教育學生提供22項創新電子學習方案，其中18項更融合人工智能技術。其中三位項目負責人為嘉賓簡介項目的功能和願景。

陳黃麗娟博士表示：「學生要能有序和適當地善用和控制新科技，而非反被新科技控制，學校與教師的引導扮演着很重要角色。故此，教育界在擁抱創新科技的同時，亦要具備善用人工智能的素養。首屆『人工智能在語文及不同科目的學與教應用國際高峰會及會後工作坊系列』由教育局、語常會、教育城及香港理工大學英文及傳意學系合辦，旨在為教師、研究人員和教育界其他人士提供一個寶貴的實踐平台，讓大家可互相學習，並分享各自在教育領域中運用人工智能的見解。」

此外，在蔡若蓮博士及李漢祥見證下，教育城行政總監林峯博士分別和資訊科技教育領袖協會、香港千帆科技及香港電腦教育學會簽署合作協議，進一步推動本港數字教育發展。教育局讚揚香港電腦教育學會和資訊科技教育領袖協會，多年來對推動數字教育發展的貢獻，亦感謝香港千帆科技與教育城的攜手協作，推出支援數字教育的創新項目，期望能將創新科技引進學界，助力教育數字化轉型。"
行政長官出席「星耀紫荊慶回歸」紅館晚會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-06-30 20:52,2025-06-30 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000814.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（六月三十日）出席「星耀紫荊慶回歸」紅館晚會的致辭：

尊敬的周霽主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任）、董經緯署長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署署長）、崔建春特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署特派員）、王兆兵副政委（中國人民解放軍駐香港部隊副政治委員）、譚錦球主席（香港各界慶典委員會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位香港市民：

大家晚上好！我很高興今天晚上來到紅磡香港體育館，出席香港各界慶典委員會舉辦的「星耀紫荊慶回歸」晚會，與大家一同分享香港回歸祖國28周年的喜悅。

今天是六月三十日，是《香港國安法》公布實施五周年的歷史時刻。五年以來，香港由亂到治，現正邁向由治及興，經濟發展重拾動能，社會民生煥發新機。

今日的香港在國際舞台上光芒四射。香港穩居全球最自由經濟體榜首，在國際金融中心指數和世界競爭力排名都位列世界第三。香港的本地生產總值連續九個季度保持增長，今年的新股集資額目前位列全球第一，發展動能強勁。

香港薈萃中西文化，是亞洲盛事之都，國際會議、藝術展覽、文化表演、體育競技等活動終年不斷，吸引大量香港市民和海內外遊客參與。

辦盛事必須有好的場地。政府因此不斷努力，為各種活動提供更完善的硬件配套。今年三月，香港歷史上最大型的體育基建——啟德體育園隆重開幕，為香港提供世界級的多用途體育和演唱會等盛事設施。啟德體育園開幕至今接近四個月，為香港帶來國際巨星表演和頂尖體育賽事等，精彩紛呈。

我們現在身處的香港體育館，自從一九八三年啟用以來，一直為香港提供舉行體育活動、綜藝節目、流行音樂會和會議等的場地，是香港的地標建築，位處紅磡這個交通便利的優越位置，所以我們都叫它「紅館」。我很高興，「紅館」即將迎來新的任務，定位將改為演唱會優先，為各種演唱會的主辦單位提供更多檔期，有助香港發展演唱會經濟，社會也普遍歡迎。

為了慶祝香港回歸祖國，香港各界慶典委員會以「星耀紫荊慶回歸」為主題，精心籌備了今天的晚會，邀請了歌唱家、藝人、合唱團和舞蹈團表演，可以說是第一批唱響「紅館」新定位的代表。我肯定慶委會一直以來為香港建設和諧家園的貢獻，也感謝所有參與表演的單位和個人，與我們一起唱好中華文化，唱好中國和香港故事。

各位市民，特區政府今年慶祝回歸的主題是「攜手治及興，變革創未來」。特區政府將繼續全力發揮香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的優勢和作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色。只要我們團結一致，社會各界與特區政府攜手努力，奮發前行，變革求新，共建更繁盛的香港，東方之珠將更加耀目璀璨。

我祝願國家富強昌盛，香港欣欣向榮，今天晚會圓滿成功，各位盡興而歸。謝謝大家。"
