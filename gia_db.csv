Special traffic and transport arrangements for Kai Tak Stadium concerts on December 6 and 7,2025-12-04 10:00,2025-12-04 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/04/P2025120300546.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (December 4) said that special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented to facilitate the holding of concerts at Kai Tak Stadium on the evenings of December 6 and 7. As the traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, concertgoers should opt for public transport and avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the interval between trains of the Tuen Ma Line. The last MTR train to Lo Wu Station via interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line will depart from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm. Franchised bus companies will provide 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange (route No. SP12), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and Airport (route No. A25S), and major districts across the territory.

  Concertgoers who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day may also take the KTSP's cross-boundary coach services during dispersal. Passengers should purchase tickets from the operators' online platforms in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal.

  The Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (3.30pm to 6pm) and suspended for taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid the outflux of spectators and passengers' patience is appreciated.

  Spectators are advised to heed real-time information via the on-site broadcast and the ""Easy Leave"" platform (easyleave.police.gov.hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application and radio and television broadcasts."

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-03 23:59,2025-12-04 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300978.htm," The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fundraising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows.

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po established by the Government, donations received have reached $2.1 billion as of noon today (December 3). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $2.4 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 52 cases have been processed, and disbursements are under way. In addition, the Government announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance of $50,000 to each affected household. As of today, 326 cases have been processed, and disbursements are ongoing. 

 As of 4pm today, the Government has registered around 1 930 households for an emergency subsidy of $10,000, with disbursements made to 1 921 households. For the remaining approximately 10 households, collection will be arranged at the Home Affairs Enquiry Centre in the district where they currently stay or at the Tai Po Home Affairs Enquiry Centre.

 To ease the financial burden on residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po and the families of the deceased during this difficult time, the Government will waive the affected property owners' and residents' unsettled balance of tax payable for the year of assessment 2024/25 and the provisional tax payable for the year of assessment 2025/26. In other words, they will not need to settle the tax demand notes issued for the year of assessment 2024/25. The Government will also pay the Government rent on behalf of the affected property owners and residents and waive the rates for domestic tenements that became inhabitable due to the fire. Additionally, the Government will waive the water and sewage charges for residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po from July to November this year.

 Social workers of the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 600 affected households so far to register for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. SWD staff also paid a visit to the affected residents staying in transitional housing units in Tai Po today, and distributed Octopus cards with a face value of $2,000 to facilitate their daily travels and address their imminent needs. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

 As of this morning, a total of 1 152 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 1 765 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Moreover, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

 The supplies donation online platform (www.taipodonation.hk), established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. Alongside earlier information provided by the public via WhatsApp, the Government has so far received over 1 100 registrations for various donation items, including food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is consolidating and integrating all donation data and has initiated the matching process to address the medium- and long-term needs of residents, so that appropriate supplies can be distributed to relevant locations. After co-ordinating with the relevant policy bureau and donors, the first batch of supplies comprising bedding and electrical appliances has been arranged for transport to a venue in preparation for residents' moving in. The Government will continue to carry out the matching of supplies registered for donation.

Handling of reported missing persons
------------------------------------------

 The Police have completed searches at all seven buildings. Around 600 officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit (DVIU) conducted searches at the two most affected buildings today and handled three sets of newly found human remains. The number of the deceased has been updated to 159. The Police will continue to follow up on the reported missing persons, aiming to confirm their status and the number of casualties as soon as possible.

Investigations
-----------------

 The Police have so far arrested a total of 15 people from various construction companies on suspicion of manslaughter. The arrested persons have been released on bail and are requested to report back to the Police in mid-December. Additionally, the Police arrested six persons in charge and staff members of a registered fire service installation contractor for fraud yesterday. The Police have accorded top priority to the case and are gathering evidence through various channels for a thorough and in-depth investigation. The possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

 To determine the cause of the fire, fire officers continue to excavate debris on the first-floor platform of Wang Cheong House. They are also conducting a preliminary investigation into the fire damage situation and collecting samples for analysis at Wang Tai House and Wang Kin House. Additionally, they are assisting the DVIU with aerial inspections at the scene for investigation and evidence collection.

 Fire officers have also started evidence gathering, such as retrieving exhibits from the fire pump room and confirming the power supply status of the fire alarm system during the incident.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

The Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau, together with the structural engineering experts and professionals from the Housing Department, will conduct the extraction of concrete cores samples from the relevant buildings in Wang Fuk Court next week at the soonest for the preparation of a detailed structural analysis. They will also carry out further support works in those units that may be subject to more damage with emergency maintenance contractors, the Police Force, and the Fire Services Department.

Separately, the ICU has deployed a dedicated team to Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme and Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) today to collect samples of the protective nets on site. The contractors also provided the test certificates for further follow-up actions.

The registered contractors of the four HOS courts, namely Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin, Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, and On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, have been dismantling the protective nets in the respective HOS courts. The contractor of Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan also started removing the protective nets. The ICU will go to the locations concerned again to monitor and follow up on the progress. On public housing estates, currently 15 housing estates are conducting maintenance works in relatively larger and localised areas with protective nets. The removal of all the protective nets will take place and is expected to be completed tomorrow.

In light of the latest Police investigation, the Development Bureau announced today that to protect public safety and put residents' and businesses' minds at ease, any scaffold nets installed on external walls of all public and private buildings, as well as government buildings undergoing major repair works, must be immediately removed, and works on those walls must cease. Departments responsible for inspections of relevant projects will promptly contact the relevant contractors, instructing them to complete the removal within the next three working days, i.e. on or before this Saturday (December 6). For individual cases where removal cannot be completed within that timeframe, the responsible party must notify the relevant department in advance, which will assess whether there are reasonable grounds for discretionary arrangements. The Buildings Department (BD) aims to issue a new code of practice next week, requiring all scaffold net materials to be sampled on site. The scaffold nets can only be installed after being certified by designated laboratories as compliant with relevant requirements.

Relevant departments inspected existing buildings undergoing major external wall maintenance earlier and took samples for testing from buildings with scaffold nets installed. As of today, the BD has taken samples from 398 private buildings with scaffold nets installed and sent them for testing in batches. The Architectural Services Department has also inspected all 18 of its public works building projects and collected samples for testing. Due to the large sample size (with thousands of samples being drawn), it will take considerable time to conduct the sampling and testing, and all parties will strive to complete this as soon as possible. Moreover, apart from the two buildings where plastic sheeting was found blocking the windows as announced earlier (which have been removed already in accordance with the Government's instructions), the BD did not find other buildings that used foam boards or plastic sheeting to block windows.

 The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As at 4pm today, the LD has inspected 175 construction sites, issued a total of 92 written warnings and 49 improvement notices, and has taken out 13 prosecutions."
HKSAR Government strongly condemns unfounded remarks and malicious attacks made by anti-China and destabilising forces regarding support and relief work on the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po,2025-12-03 23:40,2025-12-03 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300960.htm,"âThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (December 3) strongly disapproved and rejected foreign forces, including anti-China media organisations, and anti-China and destabilising forces for not just making unfounded and slanderous remarks regarding the HKSAR Government's relief work on and investigations into the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, but also for their sowing of discord and malicious attack on the rescue operations. Those who try to use the disaster to stir up chaos in society are malicious, blotting out the efforts of the HKSAR Government and of all sectors of the community in the rescue operations and support work. Those people should be condemned.

An HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""In the aftermath of the fire, the entire Hong Kong society is suffering from a collective trauma. In this difficult time, what we need is a society that is united, with everyone serving with perseverance, sparing no effort in followup support and recovery work with a view to achieving early recovery of society.

  ""Regrettably, foreign forces and anti-China and destabilising forces with ulterior motives, through disseminating fake news and false messages on the Internet, and even distributing seditious pamphlets, etc., intended to maliciously smear the rescue work, instigate social division and conflict to undermine the society's unity in taking forward the support and relief work. It even causes 'secondary damage' to the affected residents. If these acts are left unchecked, not only would they negatively impact on the relief work after the fire, they would even undermine the stability of society and endanger national security. We must not let our guard down against such risks.""

The spokesman emphasised: ""The HKSAR Government will not tolerate any malicious smearing targeting the HKSAR Government and rescue personnel without regard to the ordeal the society is facing, in particular criminal acts that are intended to incite hatred against the government, confounding right and wrong. Indeed, what is most needed now is for all sectors of Hong Kong to stand united as one in supporting the affected residents to move beyond their grief as soon as possible and to help them continue to live better lives. We will not condone any person who attempts to sabotage or interfere with the rescue work. Wherever they are, the HKSAR Government will make every effort in pursuing them in accordance with the law and make sure that justice is done.

  ""Members of the public must stay alert to those who seek to exploit the disaster and disseminate unfounded information, attempting to antagonise the society, inciting public hatred against the HKSAR Government and our country, etc., thus endangering national security. The HKSAR Government appeals to members of the public not to defy the law, refrain from having connection with and resolutely dissociate themselves from anti-China and destabilising forces. The HKSAR Government will exhaust all means to pursue and combat them, ensuring that any violation against the law will be pursued regardless of distance through decisive enforcement actions carried out in accordance with the law."""
保安局局長與發展局局長會見傳媒答問內容（只有中文）,2025-12-03 23:20,2025-12-03 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300826.htm,"保安局局長鄧炳強與發展局局長甯漢豪今日（十二月三日）會見傳媒，以下是他們的答問內容：

記者：首先想問甯局長，火災事故顯示屋宇署之前在棚網巡查有不足，你作為發展局局長，負責管轄屋宇署，你覺得應該如何問責？剛才提到有些承建商，棚網報告造假，想了解發展局會否將他們除牌？亦有一些與宏福苑大火相關的工程顧問公司傳出結業，發展局會如何處理，如果要將相關承建商除牌，除牌後的工程接手程序會是怎樣？

發展局局長：你有三個問題。首先，在這事件發生後，行政長官成立了不同的工作組，其中一個由政務司司長主持。這個工作組會檢視我們現時的規管制度有否不足之處，如果有不足之處就去補足。同時，行政長官昨天也宣布會成立一個獨立委員會。這個委員會的工作範疇亦會檢視我們現時就大廈維修的一些機制，包括巡查和各方面的要求。我們如果向前看，以及作為檢討今次事件有甚麼做得不足，我們都會在我剛才說的兩個情況下處理。至於問責問題，我相信現時最重要是做好善後工作，以及做好我們的制度。就此我也想補充一點，一直以來我們的《建築物條例》，其中一個很重要的建基點就是在整個建築工程，包括新樓工程或者維修工程，其實都有很多層層疊疊的專業人士和承建商，以至政府參與其中。當中亦有很多情況是建基於我們的專業人士和承建商，對他們提出要求，亦希望他們要負一定的責任。如果今次事件揭示出在這些環節，有時真的不可以基於一個信任，大家會守法做事，我們在這些環節就要加強，不單止屋宇署要加強，因為《建築物條例》的執管工作有部分授權予其他部門，亦有政府部門，即使他們的工程不受制於《建築物條例》，其實大家也會參詳希望用最好的方法。剛才你提到，如果有些註冊承建商確實有違規，我們現在跟進，根據《建築物條例》是有一個除牌制度，但是本身都要按機制去做，所以我們會因應調查結果才會跟進，我們都要依法辦事。至於你說如果真的有個別承建商被除牌或者因為其他原因結業，就這些商業糾紛，業界自己都要因為這些害群之馬承受苦楚，大家都要深思整個事件帶來的教訓。

記者：第一題想問鄧局長。消防處早前指宏福苑的警鐘沒有關閉，但今日警方拘捕消防裝置承辦商，指他們向消防處訛稱工程期間不會關閉警鐘，想問問警鐘是有開但失靈，抑或沒有開呢？這個資料有些混亂，是否政府太心急公布，造成信息混亂呢？第二條想追問甯局長，剛才你提到棚網那些檢測，附加的工程費由哪個部門或者哪個機構去承擔？為甚麼之前不早點開始做這件事，要到意外之後才做呢？

發展局局長：或者我先答你後面的問題。如果我們指示有關的承建商將棚網下架，是建基於屋宇署署長或者其他獲授權的執管部門認為有可疑，我們擔心安全情況下，依法作出這個要求，所以有關費用的承擔，要由有關承建商去承擔。至於承建商如果涉及私樓，它和業主立案法團的合約條款是怎樣寫，他們要根據合約條款去處理。當然如果是政府部門的樓宇或是公營房屋，這些都是有關的政府部門與承建商按合約去處理。

保安局局長：或者我談談我們拘捕了六名人士，關於（宏福苑）消防系統和消防栓的狀態的虛假陳述。我想在這裏說，作為一個透明的政府，我們很想將做了檢測的資訊，告訴市民大眾，我們沒有事情需要隱瞞。正如在初期的檢測，第一次在宏志閣低層檢測了一些安全網，發覺那一批是合規格的話，我們亦會公布。而事後我們都覺得奇怪、可疑，於是再取多很多樣本去檢測，檢測完之後（發現）原來不合規格，亦向大家公布。

我們每一次有初步結果都希望向社會大眾公布，因為大家都很關注。如果等到很遲很遲、等到終極報告才公布的話，相信社會會有很多揣測，亦會覺得我們不透明，所以作為一個透明的政府、一個負責任的政府，我們有初步信息時就會公布。謝謝大家。

記者：首先想問甯局長，剛才你提到爭取下星期將大維修棚網下架檢測，除了棚網外，如果在拆棚網時發現有發泡膠，又會如何處理？另外，現時我們是否有真正安全的棚網供應商，會不會有安全的棚網供應商推介給受影響的地盤去用？另外，再次安裝棚網時會否要求加裝安全措施，例如煙霧感應器？最後也想問問，好像之前調查所說，宏福苑的工程承辦商是魚目混珠，將阻燃和不阻燃的棚網混合來使用，是否代表屋宇署的巡查，就好像鄧局長幾日前所說，如果草率的話，只會拿到合格的標本，是否代表巡查是草率呢？

發展局局長：你有好幾個問題，第一個首先要澄清，我剛才說的宣布，有關大型外牆維修的棚網要在這個星期六或之前就要下架，不是等到下星期，要在這個星期六或之前。另外下星期是怎樣呢，因為網除了下來或者又有新的維修工序要做，都很想搭棚和有網的話，我們希望引入一個全新要求，其實就是簡單地說，就是所有這些棚網的物料，送到有關工地的時候，我們就地要求有關的承建商，按屋宇署的指示，在特別的位置和數目去採樣，然後送去我們指定的化驗所，證實了合格之後，他們才可以將這個來貨掛上棚。當然細節上，因為我們今日剛剛跟業界一些代表坐下來開始談，所以我們希望下一個星期爭取盡快公布，讓我們這些大廈維修工程，大家安心，在我們就地取樣和檢測的情況下，掛一些合格的網上架。我在這裏也想強調，我們這次要求下架的行動，是出於希望保障公眾安全，以及寧願從嚴處理，並不代表現時坊間所有在棚上的網都是不合規。至於具體的情況如何，我們會等待化驗結果出來，逐批逐批我們就會知道了，但今次我們是希望保障公眾安全為先。

剛才你提到，如果業界想有一些安全、合法、合規的供應商，其實市場一定有這些供應商，如果有疑問，我深信我們的建造業議會，他們作為業界一個團結統籌的機關會提供協助。最後你說宏福苑也顯示有魚目混珠的情況，正正是這樣，今次屋宇署去做抽樣檢查的時候，每一幢大廈都用了一個很嚴謹的方法。舉個例子，如果是一幢二十層高的大廈，它的上、中、下位置都有取樣，找搭棚師傅爬到高處，每一幢二十層高的大廈，大約取樣二十多至三十個樣本，所以我剛才說三百多幢大廈，就是數以千計的樣本了。當然過去這些取樣的工作，在過去的制度，並非每一幢樓宇都有這樣做，我們相信它有一些合格的證書，往後來看，相信我們下星期出台的新守則會徹底改變這個制度。

記者：想問甯局長，剛才說要在星期六前將所有棚網下架，有個別大維修工程如果無法下架，需要由局方進行商討或檢視，想問涉及甚麼情況或甚麼會導致他們無需將棚網下架，是否包括冷氣機或者其他需要安裝的維修？

發展局局長：為甚麼我剛才說我們要求他三日或之前，但是我都有這個註腳，如果有個別情況，因為現時大維修進行的項目實在多元多樣，我們恐防有些個別情況真的有合理原因，或者屋苑涉及很大範圍，不能夠在三日之內完成，或者有其他技術原因，我們都會經部門審視，但是我們不會輕易讓他用多於三日，一定要有很合理的理據，但我不能夠在這一刻想像到各種不同情況，這個交回執管部門處理。"
Lai Chee-ying has been receiving appropriate treatment and medical care during his detention,2025-12-03 23:18,2025-12-03 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300915.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (December 3) strongly condemns certain media, including Agence France-Presse, for their fact-twisting reports concerning the case under the Hong Kong National Security Law involving Lai Chee-ying, as well as the treatment and medical services provided by the HKSAR Government during his detention. These reports seek to smear the HKSAR by misleading the public into believing that the custodial and medical arrangements for Lai Chee-ying have been poor. Their despicable intent to vilify Hong Kong's rule of law is blatant and violates the professional conduct of journalists.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government reiterated, ""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) and relevant units handle the custodial arrangements for Lai Chee-ying in the same way as other persons-in-custody (PICs). Lai Chee-ying's legal representatives have also made clear that Lai Chee-ying has all along been receiving appropriate treatment and care in prison. The false reports by relevant media have no factual basis at all. In fact, the CSD attaches great importance to the safety and health of PICs. Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, which includes good ventilation, appropriate and timely medical support, as well as religious services. At the same time, the CSD also provides PICs with healthy food in accordance with legal requirements, which are in line with existing international health guidelines. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected.

""The HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that the medical services received by Lai Chee-ying in custody are adequate and comprehensive. The CSD supports PICs with medical services provided by the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority. In general, examination and treatment are conducted by medical staff stationed in the CSD facilities. Based on the needs of individual PICs, cases will be referred to specialist departments under the Hospital Authority for further follow-up. Professional medical staff provide the most suitable medical services to patients, and PICs are treated equally. During the public court hearing in August this year, senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying clearly presented to the court that the correctional institutions had been arranging daily medical checkups for Lai Chee-ying and that there had been no complaints at all regarding the medical services he was receiving, and the Court commended the CSD. Separately, the CSD has also arranged dedicated chaplains to provide religious services to Lai Chee-ying in accordance with his wishes. Some media have chosen to turn a blind eye to these facts, and continue to repeat lies and engage in despicable practices, which we strongly oppose.

""Furthermore, in the interests of a particular prisoner or for the maintenance of good order and discipline, the Commissioner of Correctional Services is empowered to make arrangements under section 68B of the Prison Rules that such prisoner should not associate with other prisoners (i.e. the so-called 'solitary confinement'). One of the purposes of the relevant arrangement is to ensure the personal safety and well-being of the PICs. The arrangement for Lai Chee-ying's removal from association from other PICs has all along been made at his own request and approved by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law.""

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that as the legal proceedings involving Lai Chee-ying are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the case in an attempt to interfere with the court to exercise judicial power independently, which might otherwise constitute perverting the course of justice. Nevertheless, relevant media continue to distort the facts, blatantly smear Lai Chee-ying's detention conditions and medical arrangements, and attempt to exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR. Such acts must be sternly denounced to set the record straight."""
​政府公布跟進大埔火災最新情況,2025-12-03 23:01,2025-12-03 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300952.htm,"政府就大埔宏福苑火災成立的三個工作組——調查及規管工作組、緊急支援及募捐工作組，以及應急住宿安排工作組——正全力持續跟進火災的支援、善後及調查事宜，詳情如下：

經濟及福利援助

截至今日上午，共有1 152名居民入住由民政及青年事務局協調的青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間；另有1 765名居民入住房屋局的過渡性房屋或香港房屋協會項目的單位。此外，大埔民政事務處現維持一所位於大埔社區中心的臨時庇護中心對外開放，供有需要人士使用；另一所位於東昌街社區會堂的臨時庇護中心，則會繼續運作至所有使用者全部遷往經安排的應急住宿為止。

物資援助／捐獻
———————

政府與資訊科技業界構建的物資捐獻網上平台（www.taipodonation.hk）繼續運作，團體及市民可於平台登記可捐贈的物資。連同較早時透過WhatsApp收到市民的信息，政府至今共收到超過1 100個登記，捐獻物品種類涵蓋食品及飲品、衣物、日常生活用品、寢具、電器等多個類別。政府正統一整合所有捐獻資料，並已就滿足居民的中長期需要啓動配對工作，以便把適用物資派送予有需要的地點。經過與相關政策局和捐獻團體／人士的聯繫，第一批物資（包括寢具和電器用品）已獲安排運送至即將開放予居民入住的地點。政府會持續進行有關捐獻物資的配對工作。

處理報稱失聯人士個案
——————————

警方已完成所有七幢大廈的搜索工作。今日約600名「災難遇害者辨認組」人員在其中兩幢受災最嚴重大廈內搜索時，共處理三具新發現的遺骸，死者數目更新至159人。警方會繼續跟進報稱失聯人士個案，務求盡快確認他們的情況及死傷人數。

調查工作
————

警方至今共拘捕15名來自不同的工程公司相關人士，涉嫌誤殺，他們已獲保釋候查，須於十二月中旬向警方報到。另外，警方昨日拘捕六名註冊消防裝置承辦商的負責人及職員，涉嫌欺詐。警方極度重視案件，正循多方面搜證，作出全面及深入的調查，不排除有更多人被捕。

為確定起火原因，消防人員繼續在宏昌閣一樓平台的瓦礫進行挖掘工作，亦對宏泰閣及宏建閣的火警損毀情況進行初步調查，收集樣本進行分析。消防人員亦協助警方的「災難遇害者辨認組」在現場進行空中視察，以便進行調查及蒐證工作。

消防人員已展開取證工作，如檢取消防泵房內的證物，以及確認火警警報系統在火災時的供電狀態等。

規管巡查
————

房屋局獨立審查組（審查組）聯同結構工程專家及房屋署專業人員最快下周抽取宏福苑相關樓宇的混凝土芯樣本作詳細結構分析，並將會與緊急維修承建商、警務處及消防處對小量結構損壞較嚴重單位進行進一步鞏固工程。

另外，審查組今日派出專隊到租置屋邨柴灣峰華邨和居屋屋苑深水埗怡閣苑現場實地採集棚網樣本，並已收取承建商提供的檢測證書，以作進一步跟進行動。

四個居屋屋苑（包括沙田穗禾苑、深水埗清麗苑、深水埗怡閣苑及觀塘安基苑）的註冊承建商已陸續拆除屋苑內棚網，而柴灣峰華邨的承建商亦已開始拆除棚網的工作。審查組會再到有關地點，監察及跟進有關進度。至於公共屋邨，目前有15個屋邨有進行局部較大範圍而有棚網的維修工程，有關棚網將全數拆除，並於明日完成。

發展局因應警方最新調查，為保障公眾安全及為免住戶／商戶忐忑不安，今日宣布所有現時正進行大維修的樓宇，當中包括公營、私人樓宇和政府大樓，如果外牆設有棚網，需要即時將棚網下架，並停止外牆工程。負責巡查有關項目的各個部門會立即聯絡相關承建商，指示他們在未來三個工作天，即本周六（十二月六日）或之前完成棚網下架。如個別個案未能做到，需要預先通報相關審查部門，由部門審視是否有合理理由可以作出通融。屋宇署會爭取在下星期發出新的作業守則，要求所有棚網物料就地採樣，經過指定的檢測所檢測並確定合格後，才可以再上架。

各有關部門早前巡查了正進行外牆大維修的現存樓宇，並向有棚網的樓宇取樣檢驗。截至今日，屋宇署已就398幢有棚網的私人樓宇抽取樣本，陸續分批送交測試，建築署亦已巡查轄下所有18個工務工程樓宇項目並取樣檢驗。由於樣本數量龐大（抽取的樣本數以千計），需要較多時間進行採樣及檢測工作，各方會爭取早日完成。此外，除早前已公布發現的兩幢有塑膠板遮封窗戶的樓宇（已按政府指示移除），屋宇署暫未有再發現有發泡膠或塑膠板遮封窗戶的樓宇。

勞工處繼續巡查設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工程工地的防火設施及火災應變安排，以保障工人的職業安全。截至今日下午四時，勞工處已巡查175個建築地盤，共發出92份書面警告及49張敦促改善通知書，並提出13宗檢控。"
黎智英羈押期間得到適切待遇及醫療照顧,2025-12-03 22:20,2025-12-03 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300902.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十二月三日）對於包括法國新聞社在內的一些媒體，就黎智英所涉及的《香港國安法》案件，及特區政府在其羈押期間提供的待遇及醫療服務，作出歪曲事實的報道，予以強烈譴責。有關報道企圖抹黑香港特區，令公眾誤信黎智英的羈押和醫療服務安排惡劣，其旨在污衊香港法治的卑劣用心昭然若揭，違背新聞工作者專業操守。

特區政府發言人重申：「懲教署及相關單位在處理黎智英的羈押安排時，跟其他在囚人士一視同仁，黎智英的代表律師亦早已澄清，清楚指出黎智英在獄中一直獲得適切的治療和待遇，有關媒體的不實報道完全沒有任何事實基礎。事實上，懲教署一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康。不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，署方一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供良好的通風環境、合適和及時的醫療支援，以及宗教服務。同時，署方亦按法例要求為在囚人士提供有益健康的食物，而且與現行的國際健康指引相符。懲教署也設有一系列機制，例如透過獨立訪客（即太平紳士）定期巡視的安排，以確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。」

「特區政府已多次強調，黎智英在羈押期間所獲得的醫療服務是完備的。懲教署為在囚人士提供的醫療服務由衞生署及醫院管理局提供，一般的情況會由進駐懲教院所的醫護人員提供檢查及治療，而按個別在囚人士的需要，也會將個案轉介到醫院管理局轄下的專科部門跟進。專業的醫護人員會為病人提供最適切的醫療服務，對在囚人士亦一視同仁。在今年八月的公開法庭聆訊中，代表黎智英的資深大律師已向法庭清楚表明，懲教院所為黎智英每日安排醫療檢查，且對黎智英在懲教院所內獲得的醫療服務沒有任何投訴，法官表示懲教署值得稱讚。另一方面，懲教署亦有安排專職教士按黎智英的意願提供宗教服務。有關媒體對這些事實視而不見，繼續重複謊言和作出卑劣操作，我們對此堅決反對。」

「此外，為某囚犯的利益或為維持秩序或紀律，懲教署署長根據《監獄規例》第68B條可作出有關囚犯不應與其他囚犯交往的安排（即所謂的『單獨監禁』）。有關安排的其中一個目的是保障囚犯的人身安全和福祉。有關黎智英與其他囚犯中止交往的安排，一直是根據黎智英本人的意願並由懲教署經考慮所有相關因素後依法安排的。」

特區政府發言人指出：「特區政府已多次強調，由於黎智英所涉及的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不應評論有關案件以圖干預法院獨立進行審判，否則可能構成妨礙司法公正。雖然如此，有關媒體仍繼續顛倒是非、公然抹黑黎智英的羈押情況和醫療服務安排，企圖向特區法院施壓，必須嚴厲直斥其非，以正視聽。」"
特區政府強烈譴責反中亂港分子就特區政府跟進大埔宏福苑火災的支援善後工作的失實言論,2025-12-03 22:15,2025-12-03 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300896.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十二月三日）對外部勢力，包括反華傳媒機構，以及反中亂港分子，不但就特區政府跟進大埔宏福苑火災的支援善後及調查工作發表失實和抹黑的言論，甚至搬弄是非、惡意攻擊救災工作，對此特區政府表示強烈不滿及反對。這些以災生亂之徒，用心險惡，抹煞了特區政府和社會各界為救災所作出的努力，必須予以譴責。

特區政府發言人指出：「火災發生後，整個香港社會目前正經歷一場集體傷痛。在這個艱難時刻，我們最需要的，是社會團結一致，大家一起守好自己的崗位，盡全力處理好火災的善後工作，令社會可以早日復原。」

「可惜的是，一些別有用心的外部勢力及反中亂港分子，竟然在火災發生後，意圖透過在網上散播假新聞、假消息，甚至派發煽動性傳單等，惡意抹黑救援工作、挑動社會分化對立，影響社會團結一致推動救災善後工作，更對受災的居民造成『二次傷害』。若任由這些行為蔓延，不單會影響火災的善後工作，甚至影響香港社會穩定，危害國家安全，我們絕對不能掉以輕心。」

發言人強調：「特區政府絕不容忍任何不顧當前困境、顛倒是非，而對特區政府及救援人員工作的惡意抹黑，尤其是意圖挑起市民對政府的仇恨的犯罪行為。現在最需要的是香港社會各界團結一致、眾志成城，支持受災的居民盡快走出傷痛，幫助他們好好的繼續生活。任何意圖破壞救援工作、製造種種障礙的人，我們都不會姑息。無論他們身處何地，特區政府將竭盡全力、依法迎頭痛擊，確保正義得以伸張。」

「社會大眾必須對利用災情散播失實資訊，意圖分化社會、煽動市民對特區政府和對國家仇恨等危害國家安全的行為提高警覺。特區政府呼籲社會大眾不要以身試法，不應與破壞社會穩定的反中亂港分子有任何瓜葛，堅決與其劃清界線。針對任何惡意抹黑、煽動仇恨的行為，特區政府將全力做到『違法必究，雖遠必誅』，依法採取果斷執法行動。」"
Flexible handling of Government fees and bills of residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po,2025-12-03 21:25,2025-12-03 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300817.htm,"âIn view of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the Chief Executive has instructed all government departments to be considerate to the residents of Wang Fuk Court, and to provide as much support as possible to them by flexibly handling relevant government fees and bills.

Following this principle, the Immigration Department has waived service charges for residents to replace their identity documents; all injured individuals admitted to public hospitals under the Hospital Authority will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation; and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department will waive fees for columbarium and related services.

A Government spokesperson said today (December 3), ""In order to ease the financial burden on residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po and the families of the deceased during this difficult time, we will waive the affected property owners' and residents' unsettled balance of tax payable for the year of assessment 2024/25 and the provisional tax payable for the year of assessment 2025/26. In other words, they will not need to settle the tax demand notes issued for the year of assessment 2024/25. We will also pay the Government rent on behalf of the affected property owners and residents and waive the rates for domestic tenements that became inhabitable due to the fire.  

""In addition, we will waive the residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po the water and sewage charges of July to November this year. Regarding electricity tariffs and telecommunications service fees, we appreciate the relevant organisations which have offered various support services to the residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. For instance, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited has waived the electricity tariffs of November for the affected customers and will arrange deposit refunds to them as soon as possible. Various telecommunications operators have also provided assistance to the affected customers such as offering services fee waivers, free rental of smart phones and free pre-paid SIM cards. In addition, Sinopec (Hong Kong) Gas Company Limited has offered a full waiver of liquefied petroleum gas bills of November for all affected customers."""
發展局局長會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）,2025-12-03 20:55,2025-12-03 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300792.htm,"保安局局長鄧炳強與發展局局長甯漢豪今日（十二月三日）會見傳媒。以下是甯漢豪的開場發言︰

大家好，除了剛才保安局局長交代警方的行動外，屋宇署和房屋局的獨立審查組今日分別去了報道中提及的四個有關屋苑，包括私人屋苑、居屋和租置屋苑涉事承建商的地方，檢取了相關文件。這四個屋苑也分別在早前或今日進行了棚網採樣工作。

基於現時最新情況，我們看到真的懷疑有人在文書上造假，為了保障公眾安全和免除我們現時做大廈維修的業主、住戶心裏的忐忑，政府認為應該從嚴處理。所以我現在宣布，所有現時正進行大維修的樓宇，包括所有公營、私營樓宇和政府大樓，如果它的外牆設有棚網，都需要即時將棚網下架。負責巡查有關項目的各個部門會立即聯絡相關承建商，指示他們在未來三個工作天，即是在今個星期六或之前，完成這個棚網下架的工作。如果個別個案未能做到，他們要預先通報相關的審查部門，由部門審視是否有合理的理由可以作出通融。

根據我們現時的估計，目前如果是私營樓宇正在做大維修而還有棚網的，大約有二百多幢。如果是公營房屋或者是政府大樓的維修項目，大約有十幾宗。這些個案的棚網下架後，屋宇署會爭取在下星期發出新的作業守則，要求所有棚網的物料送到工地時就地採樣，經過指定的檢測所檢測並確定合格後，才可以再上架。因為我們知道這些棚網下架後，就正進行維修的項目，大家都會心急，希望盡快可以恢復外牆工程，所以我們爭取屋宇署下星期就發出有關指引，而其實署方剛才已經立即與業界開始商討這個指引的一些細節。

大家可能會問，接下來幾天這些棚網下架之後，會不會當中有一些不符規的就可以被「放生」。大家可以放心，其實自從這次慘劇發生後，早幾天不同部門，包括屋宇署、房屋局獨立審查組和建築署，分別去了三百多幢正在進行大型維修項目的大樓採樣。以屋宇署的採樣為例，他們做了三百幢私人樓宇。其實每一幢樓宇都是用很嚴謹的方法，在上、中、下，包括一些很高的位置，由棚架師傅幫我們拿了一些樣本下來。所以三百幢樓宇本身已經有數以千計的樣本，現時陸續送去我們指定的化驗所作檢驗。如果遲些化驗報告出來，顯示有一些棚網不符合標準，我們都會追究到底，按我們的《建築物條例》和其他刑事相關的條例去跟進處理。"
CHP recorded another locally acquired case of chikungunya fever,2025-12-03 20:37,2025-12-03 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300774.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 3), the CHP has recorded one new local case of chikungunya fever (CF). The CHP is collaborating with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) to implement appropriate prevention and control measures to minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest case information
------------------------------

The case involves a 23-year-old female living in Queen's Road West in Sheung Wan. A preliminary investigation revealed thatshe developed joint pain on November 27, followed by rash and a fever over the next two days respectively. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department ofQueen Mary Hospital on December 1 and was admitted for treatment. Her blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. She is now in stable condition. The patient's household contact is currently asymptomatic. The CHP is implemented prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to the household contact concerned. If necessary, the CHP will arrange for laboratory testing.

The preliminary investigation also revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. The case is classified as local. Her residence and usual activity areas do not overlap with areas where imported or local cases have been recorded in the recent month. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 77 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, eight were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------------

In response to the new local case, the CHP, together with the FEHD, have inspected various locations in the vicinity of patient's residence and conducted vector investigations andmosquito control operations today with a view to minimising the risk of local transmission.

The CHP urged the members of the public residing and working in Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. The CHP officers will reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind them to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

 Starting tomorrow (December 4), the CHP will set up a health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre from 9am to 6pm to provide assessments to individuals with relevant symptoms. The enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which was set up earlier, will continue to operate daily from 9am to 8pm.

In addition, the CHP will send letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to be vigilant. If there are any suspected CF cases, they should contact the CHP for follow up immediately. The CHP will also inform primary care doctors in Central and Western District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned.

On the other hand, as some confirmed CF cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP continued to urge individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the aforesaid enquiry hotline.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. Pamphlets have been also distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations. The FEHD has earlier requested the relevant departments to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The FEHD also held meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to coordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
保安局局長會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）,2025-12-03 20:35,2025-12-03 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300772.htm,"保安局局長鄧炳強與發展局局長甯漢豪今日（十二月三日）會見傳媒。以下是鄧炳強的開場發言︰

各位香港市民、各位記者朋友。

我現在會與發展局局長就懷疑有屋苑維修時使用的棚網涉及行使虛假文書的情況作出報告。警方到目前為止已經就兩宗案件，分別牽涉到柴灣的峰華邨和炮台山的富澤花園，展開調查。

這兩個屋苑的棚網都宣稱是由「山東宸旭化纖繩網有限公司」生產，並宣稱分別獲得由「國家勞動保護用品質量監督檢驗中心」或「濱洲市檢驗檢測中心」發出的棚網阻燃合格檢測報告。但是根據調查所得，「國家勞動保護用品質量監督檢驗中心」並無發出相關證書，至於「濱洲市檢驗檢測中心」，暫時仍無法聯絡，而該公司留下的所有聯絡方法均為空號。

特區政府已經正式立案，會繼續調查，以及嚴肅處理，不論誰犯法都一定會追究到底。現時案件已交由港島總區重案組負責跟進調查。我們預計將會有更多類似案件展開調查。

特區政府已經與內地相關單位聯繫，他們會全面配合我們的調查。除了與內地有關單位聯絡調查之外，在本港方面，我們亦會循棚網由誰提供，以及仍有甚麼其他地方使用過這些棚網展開調查。

現在我交給發展局局長向大家報告。"

衞生防護中心再錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案,2025-12-03 20:25,2025-12-03 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300758.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月三日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱本地個案。中心正聯同食物環境衞生署（食環署）採取適當防控措施，以減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名23歲女子，住所位於上環皇后大道西。初步調查顯示，她於十一月二十七日出現關節痛，其後兩日先後出現皮疹及發燒。她於十二月一日到瑪麗醫院急症室求醫，獲安排留院治療，她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。她有一名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，中心已按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為該名家居接觸者提供醫學監察及健康建議。如有需要，中心會安排化驗檢測。

初步調查顯示，病人在潛伏期內不曾外遊，屬本地感染個案。她的住所和日常活動範圍與近月的輸入或本地個案沒有重疊的地方，流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

本港今年累計錄得77宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，八宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

針對新增一宗本地個案，中心今日已聯同食環署人員實地視察患者家居附近一帶的地點，並進行病媒調查及滅蚊，減低本地傳播的風險。

中心呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

明日（十二月四日）起，中心將於上午九時至下午六時在上環文娛中心正門入口處設立醫護站，為出現相關症狀的市民作評估。而早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）會繼續由上午九時至下午八時運作。

 此外，中心會發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺，如有懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱個案，立即通知中心跟進。中心亦會透過基層醫療署通知中西區的基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

另一方面，鑑於近期部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心繼續呼籲近期曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電上述查詢熱線。

​特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署已進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署亦已要求相關部門在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地。食環署同時向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；

連續兩日錄得兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-12-03 18:45,2025-12-03 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300663.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月三日）再接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案。中心再次敦促家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的11歲女童。她於十二月一日出現發燒、咳嗽和神智模糊，同日被帶往伊利沙伯醫院急症室求診，需留院治理，情況一度嚴重。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H3）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發腦病變。她目前仍然留醫，但情況已轉趨穩定。

初步調查顯示，女童居於海外，於十一月二十日到港。女童不曾接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得25宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的16宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度自十月下旬起逐漸下降，但仍高於基線水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會再度上升，加上北半球大部分地區的流感活躍程度持續增加或已處於高水平，市民如計劃外遊，應及早接種疫苗，因為接種疫苗後身體約需兩星期產生抗體，以對流感病毒提供足夠保護作用。由於流感可引致嚴重併發症，中心建議所有年滿6個月或以上的人士接種季節性流感疫苗，特別是孕婦、長者、兒童及長期病患者等高危人士。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as severe paediatric influenza infection cases recorded in two consecutive days,2025-12-03 18:45,2025-12-03 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300662.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 3) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP reiterated its appeal to urge parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccinations also reduce the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves an 11-year-old girl with underlying illness. She developed a fever, cough and confusion on December 1 and was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital on the same day, where she was admitted for treatment. She was in serious condition at one point. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis is influenza A infection complicated with encephalopathy. She remains hospitalised, but her condition has become stable.

A preliminary investigation revealed thatthe girl lives overseas and arrived in Hong Kong on November 20. She has not yet received the 2025/26 SIV. Her household contacts are currently asymptomatic.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 25 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including three fatal cases. The affected children were aged from 6 months to 17 years. A total of 16 cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity has gradually declined since late October. However, it remains above the baseline thresholds. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may increase again. Moreover, influenza activity has continued to increase or reached a high level in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Members of the public who intend to travel should get vaccinated early as it takes about two weeks after receiving SIV for antibodies to develop in the body and provide adequate protection against influenza virus infection. Since influenza can cause serious complications, the CHP recommends that all persons aged 6 months or above receive the SIV, particularly high-risk individualssuch as pregnant women, the elderly, children and those with underlying illnesses,"" the Head of Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially for children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, they should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

「此外，我們會豁免大埔宏福苑居民於今年七月至十一月的水費及排污費。至於電費及電訊服務費用，我們感謝相關機構已為大埔宏福苑的居民提供不同支援服務，例如：中華電力有限公司已豁免受影響客戶十一月的電費，並向有關客戶盡快安排退還電力賬戶按金；而不同電訊商亦為受影響的客戶提供豁免服務費用、免費借用手機及免費電話儲值卡等支援。此外，中石化（香港）石油氣有限公司已豁免受影響客戶十一月的氣費。」"
Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for importing and dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-12-03 18:30,2025-12-03 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300646.htm,"âTwo incoming passengers were both sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $500 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (December 3) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes, dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 36, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (December 2). About 33 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $152,000 and a duty potential of about $112,000, were seized from his personal baggage.

In addition, Customs officers intercepted a 38-year-old female passenger at the airport yesterday, and seized about 38 200 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $172,000 and a duty potential of about $126,000, from her personal baggage.

The two incoming passengers were subsequently arrested. They were both sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $500 by the court today.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. Allow me to conclude this afternoon's enriching dialogue and meaningful exchanges with a few words.

  As a true advocate for alternative dispute resolution, the Government has been making consistent and focused efforts in enhancing the culture of communication and understanding within society. Since the introduction of the ""Deepening Mediation Culture"" initiative in the 2023 Policy Address, we have stepped up the promotion of mediation and arbitration services, solidifying Hong Kong's position at the forefront of both global and regional dispute resolution. As this session's theme suggests, Hong Kong is well positioned as the Capital of Mediation.

  From the two panel discussions, with the valuable contributions and sharing from our speakers, we covered the role of mediation from both international and local standpoints. From dealing with inter-state disputes, commercial conflicts, and financial matters to community frictions, it has been shown that mediation can play a crucial role at the national level as well as in various aspects of our daily lives.

  From a global perspective, as a prominent international financial centre, Hong Kong provides not only extensive financial services but also specialised financial-related dispute resolution services. Mediation, in particular, plays a critical role in addressing complex multi-borders financial disputes by offering a fair and efficient resolution process focusing on reaching a solution acceptable to all. This capability reinforces confidence among external investors and businessmen, reassuring them that their interests and property are well protected in Hong Kong.

  On a local level, disputes are more diverse and seldom carry a clear price tag. Issues that impact our daily lives, such as water seepages, noise complaints from shared walls, or disagreements over communal facilities, can be equally stressful and disruptive. Unlike commercial disputes where parties' relationship is primarily contractual, these community conflicts involve people whose lives are closely intertwined, making amicable resolutions even more critical. In these cases, mediation has proven to be the most effective way to restore harmony; indeed, conflicts could well escalate and move from one matter to another if they are not peacefully resolved efficiently. Beyond resolving disputes, mediation also builds trust and encourages collaboration, hence fostering a long-term amicable relationship in the neighbourhood. By offering mediation skills training to property management staff, we trust we can greatly enhance the effectiveness of early intervention in community disputes. We hope after each amicable dispute resolution, the neighbours can continue to treat each other with courtesy and enjoy each other's company in the community.

  Looking ahead, I would like to share some upcoming developments on local mediation. As mentioned in this year's Policy Address, the Government will continue to strengthen the accreditation and disciplinary systems for the mediation profession. Since the establishment of the Working Group on Mediation Regulatory System in 2024, a systematic review of Hong Kong's regulatory framework for the mediation profession has been conducted, resulting in the formulation of seven preliminary recommendations. The Working Group will continue to work on proposing suitable measures for enhancing the sustainable development of the mediation regulatory system.

  Following the completion of the 15th National Games cohosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, we have witnessed the immense potential for growth in the sports landscape in the region. This provides Hong Kong with new opportunities for even more collaboration and development. With this growth comes the need for a neutral, fair and efficient dispute resolution mechanism to address any conflicts that may arise in areas of sports and related business. In this regard, the Department of Justice will soon launch the Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution to promote and support the sustainable development of the sports industry in Hong Kong.

  Lastly, this evening, the mediation lecture will explore an emerging area of dispute resolution - entertainment. Our distinguished lecturer, Professor Sungkee Hong, has come all the way from the Republic of Korea to share distinctive perspectives on this topic.

  As we conclude today's session, we would like to impress upon all of you to take mediation into action and to create a community grounded in understanding, collaboration, and lasting harmony. Thank you."

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for joining us today to discuss Hong Kong's unique and visionary status as the Capital of Mediation.

Hong Kong as the Capital of Mediation is not merely an aspirational slogan but a status built upon a foundation of strong national backing and a distinct identity: rooted in history, reinforced in practice, and recognised in policy. The 14th FiveâYear Plan expressly supports Hong Kong's development as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the AsiaâPacific region. This national endorsement provides the momentum for us to leverage our unique position and project our robust rule of law globally.

Hong Kong's development in mediation began with the Civil Justice Reform initiated in the early 2000s and the pioneering work of the Working Group on Mediation headed by the then Secretary for Justice. These early efforts marked a decisive cultural shift in our legal landscape - from litigation being viewed as the default mechanism for dispute resolution towards embracing mediation as a primary, preferred approach that serves the interests of all parties involved. Today, Hong Kong has built an exceptionally mature mediation culture, anchored by comprehensive legal infrastructure. Effective since January 2013, the Mediation Ordinance provides a robust regulatory framework for mediation, ensuring that it remains a process characterised by confidentiality, flexibility, and reliability. Complementing this is the innovative Apology Ordinance, introduced in 2017, which facilitates reconciliation by allowing expressions of apology without admitting liability. These developments have been powered by concerted efforts across the Department of Justice, the Judiciary, and other key institutions to make amicable settlement the preferred path to justice.

The Hong Kong Judiciary also plays a vital role in promoting mediation as a key dispute resolution tool. Through initiatives like Practice Direction 31 and the establishment of Integrated Mediation Offices, our Judiciary encourages parties to resolve conflicts efficiently and amicably. This supportive stance reflects Hong Kong's commitment to fostering a culture of settlement, reducing litigation costs, and enhancing access to justice.

With a solid and longstanding foundation in mediation, amplified by strong national support, Hong Kong excels as an international mediation hub and as a ""super-connector"" between the Chinese Mainland and the international community. We serve as a neutral bridge between common law and civil law systems, not in theory but in practice. Under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), for example, we have established a specialised mediation mechanism for cross-boundary investment disputes, giving Hong Kong investors and Mainland enterprises an efficient and culturally attuned channel to resolve differences and facilitating integration and building commercial trust along the way.

To ensure this ecosystem thrives from the ground up, the Department of Justice vigorously promotes a ""mediate first"" culture. Key initiatives include the ""Mediate First"" Pledge campaign, which encourages businesses to explore to adopt mediation as a first resort in resolving disputes; the bi-annual Mediation Week, which raises public awareness in sector-specific use of mediation; and a government-wide policy requiring mediation clauses to be incorporated in government contracts. Together with a strong and growing pool of over 2 300 accredited mediators, these efforts are building a dynamic, self-reinforcing mediation culture.

And we carry this story to the world. Through targeted delegations and duty visits across Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, we are not just promoting our services; we are sharing successes, forging new partnerships, and issuing a compelling invitation to the world to collaborate with us in advancing the future of dispute resolution. This is a commitment to building a global community grounded in harmony and constructive problem-solving, the exact principles that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to model and lead as the Capital of Mediation.

In addition to the above initiatives and developments, what has set Hong Kong apart from any other mediation centres in the world and made it the Capital of Mediation is by hosting the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) headquartered right here. The IOMed is the world's first intergovernmental legal organisation exclusively dedicated to mediation as a means for the peaceful resolution of international disputes - filling an important institutional gap that previously existed in global mediation.

Since the signing ceremony of the IOMed Convention held in Hong Kong on May 30 this year attended by around 400 representatives from 85 countries across Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe including officials at the ministerial level from over 30 signatories, as well as high officials from around 20 international organisations, the Convention has already come into effect in August with the IOMed commencing actual operations on October 20 this year. Within just five months, the IOMed achieved the milestones of signing, coming into effect, and beginning operations - an exceptionally rapid pace in the history of international organisation establishment. This fully demonstrates that the establishment of the IOMed is in line with the trend of the times and has received widespread support and positive responses from the international community.

The IOMed will mediate disputes between states or between a state and foreign investors, and international commercial disputes based on the will of relevant parties. Its establishment signals a new era for mediation. It institutionalises mediation at the international level, providing a treaty-based framework that enables states and private parties to engage in bespoke, voluntary mediation processes with the assurance that the outcomes are respected.

As Foreign Minister Wang Yi aptly remarked at the IOMed signing ceremony, Hong Kong was chosen and trusted by the international community to host the IOMed for our unparalleled strengths in international mediation, our affinity to the motherland and connection to the world, our enabling business environment, and highly developed legal system.

The value of mediation and the role of Hong Kong will be further highlighted during the discussion to follow. Today's discussion will start with the keynote address by Mr Alberto Ninio, the General Counsel of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, who will tell us how multilateral development banks and international organisations could engage with mediation. The first session will then examine mediation's rising significance in international disputes, both between states and among private entities, and how tailored frameworks could facilitate the process, as illustrated by the IOMed Mediation Rules. The second session will turn the spotlight to our city's own initiatives, including government efforts to deepen mediation culture and diverse community mediation applications.

As we embark on today's discussions, let us remember the spirit that underpins the Capital of Mediation - a spirit of collaboration, respect, and relentless pursuit of peaceful solutions that benefit all.

Thank you."

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for joining us today to discuss Hong Kong's unique and visionary status as the Capital of Mediation.

Hong Kong as the Capital of Mediation is not merely an aspirational slogan but a status built upon a foundation of strong national backing and a distinct identity: rooted in history, reinforced in practice, and recognised in policy. The 14th FiveâYear Plan expressly supports Hong Kong's development as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the AsiaâPacific region.

Among the seventh batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering five survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering 13 survey areas in November, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released seven batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in November 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 49 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. October 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Fifteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
DH participates in WHO's large-scale Western Pacific Region exercise to enhance emergency preparedness and cross-sectoral collaboration for public health emergencies (with photo),2025-12-03 17:00,2025-12-03 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300321.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (December 3), together with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, participated in a large-scale annual table-top exercise, Exercise Crystal, organised by the Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) of the World Health Organization (WHO). The exercise aims to enhance emergency response mechanisms and cross-sectoral collaboration capabilities between Hong Kong, China and neighbouring regions to jointly tackle public health emergencies.

This year, the exercise simulated a scenario on human outbreaks of a novel influenza A infection related to dairy farms, with sustained human-to-human transmissions and further spread to many countries. More than 30 countries and areas in the WPRO region participated in the exercise. During the exercise, the WHO provided information on the scenario to the representatives of the participating countries and areas via videoconferencing and email. Representatives from the DH and other government departments thoroughly discussed the scenario, including the immediate responses, prevention and control measures, and the relevant co-ordination required in Hong Kong, rapidly adjusting the planning according to the evolving scenario. The exercise host of the WPRO concluded the exercise with a debriefing to review the exercise's achievements and explore with participants how to further enhance cross-regional emergency response and collaboration mechanisms.

""Emerging infectious diseases have long posed significant public health threats worldwide. With frequent international population mobility today, emerging respiratory viruses can spread across regions in a short period of time through contact with patients’ secretions or droplets, potentially causing a global pandemic. As a major international transportation hub, Hong Kong faces a significant risk of importation of emerging respiratory infectious diseases. The exercise provided us with a valuable opportunity to strengthen communication and information sharing mechanisms between Hong Kong, China and the WHO WPRO, as well as national focal points of various countries. It also further enhances the cross-departmental collaboration mechanism against emerging respiratory diseases. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) will consolidate the experience gained from this exercise, to opportunely review existing mechanisms in a timely manner, and make more forward-looking arrangements to comprehensively safeguard public health,” the Head of the Communicable Disease Branch, the CHP of the DH, Dr Albert Au, said.

Since 2008, the WPRO has conducted the Exercise Crystal annually to help member countries and regions prevent and respond to cross-regional public health risks affecting population worldwide. Meanwhile, the WPRO maintains close communication with focal points responsible for enforcing the International Health Regulations to ensure that the regions are familiar with the response mechanism to public health emergencies. Being one of the focal points between Hong Kong, China and the WHO, the CHP has actively participated in the exercise for years."

今年演習模擬乳牛牧場出現一種新型甲型流行性感冒爆發的情景，持續在人與人之間傳播，並進一步擴散至多個國家。西太平洋區域辦事處轄區內30多個國家和地區參與演習。其間，世衞透過視訊及電郵，向參與國家和地區的代表發放模擬情景訊息。衞生署和其他政府部門代表就模擬情景進行深入討論，包括本港應即時採取的應變、防控措施及相關協調工作，並根據情景發展迅速調整部署。世衞西太平洋區域辦事處的演習主持最後作出總結，檢視演習成果，並與參與者交流意見，探討如何進一步完善跨地域應急和協作機制。

衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生說：「新發傳染病一直為全球帶來重大公共衞生挑戰。現時國際人口流動頻繁，新發呼吸道疾病病毒可以透過接觸患者的分泌物或飛沫，在短時間內跨地域迅速傳播，造成全球大流行。香港作為國際交通樞紐，外來傳入新發呼吸道傳染病的風險不容忽視。是次演習為我們提供了一個寶貴機會，強化中國香港與世衞西太平洋區域辦事處及各國聯絡對口單位的溝通和信息通報機制，亦有助進一步提升本港應對新發呼吸道疾病的跨部門協作機制。中心將整合是次演習經驗，適時審視現行機制，以便作出更前瞻性部署，全面保障公眾健康。」

世衞西太平洋區域辦事處自二○○八年起，每年舉辦水晶演習，協助成員國和地區預防及應對跨地域及影響世界各地人口的公共衞生風險，同時與各地負責執行《國際衞生條例》的聯絡單位保持緊密溝通，確保各地區熟習應對公共衞生突發事件的機制。中心作為中國香港與世衞的聯絡對口單位之一，多年來一直積極參與演習。"

十一月份第七批涵蓋五個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及13個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十一月共七批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，49個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有15區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 2 to noon today (December 3), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 218 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  On November 1, 2014, the Standing Committee of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) decided to designate December 4 of each year as Constitution Day and conduct promotion of and education activities on the Constitution through multiple channels to heighten public awareness of the Constitution, promote the spirit of and enhance the implementation of the Constitution, and advance the overall law-based governance of the country.

  The Preamble of the Constitution clearly stipulates that ""realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" is a fundamental task for our country. Fully implementing the Constitution is the primary task and foundational work for advancing the country's overall law-based governance and building a socialist state under the rule of law, and has laid a solid foundation for developing socialist modernisation and realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This year's seminar will be conducted on the theme of ""The Constitution and the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation"". The seminar will feature a keynote speech and a panel discussion. The keynote speech will be delivered by member of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the Standing Committee of the NPC, and Professor of the Renmin Law School, Renmin University of China Professor Han Dayuan.

Dr Christophe Bernasconi (Secretary-General of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH)), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

I am honoured to join you all today at the Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific on Private International Law, co-organised by the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy of my department, as part of the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

In fact, this is the very first time that we co-organised an event with the HCCH during Hong Kong Legal Week. The HCCH is our long-standing partner and we have worked very closely with the HCCH for decades. With the staunch support of the Central People's Government, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been actively participating in the working groups, meetings and activities of the HCCH as part of the Chinese delegation since 1997. Through a standing arrangement with the HCCH, Hong Kong legal talent from both the private and public sectors have the opportunity to be seconded to the Permanent Bureau of the HCCH at the Hague, obtaining valuable insights into the work of the HCCH in the field of private international law.

In 2012, the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific of the HCCH was set up in the HKSAR. Since its establishment, ROAP has played a significant role in increasing awareness and understanding of the importance of the HCCH and its instruments among states and stakeholders, as well as contributing to the smooth implementation and operation of the HCCH's instruments in the Asia-Pacific region.

Today’s Symposium is another example of our long-standing collaborations with the HCCH. We are joined here today by esteemed speakers from different parts of the Asia-Pacific region, who will share their insightful views on topics relevant to the theme of today's Symposium - ""Transnational Litigation & Apostille: Innovating Practices under the HCCH Conventions"".

Hong Kong has long valued the work of the HCCH; a total of nine HCCH instruments are currently applicable to the HKSAR, including the Apostille, Service and Evidence Conventions, which will be discussed in today's Symposium. Back in 1965, the first HCCH Convention which applied to Hong Kong was the Apostille Convention, which is now one of the most widely applied multilateral treaties in the area of legal co-operation with over 125 contracting parties, followed by the Service Convention in 1970 and the Evidence Convention in 1978. Under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", these HCCH Conventions continue to apply to the HKSAR since 1997.

As the timing would suggest, these HCCH Conventions were concluded at a time which is vastly different from today. To adapt to the rapid and ever-evolving technological advancements over the years, the HCCH has developed various innovating practices to facilitate and streamline the functioning of the HCCH's Conventions in this digital age.

These innovating practices include the electronic Apostille Programme (e-APP), which is aimed at supporting the electronic issuance and verification of Apostilles around the world. The HKSAR has also implemented the e-APP in recent years, which will be discussed by Registrar Kwang from the High Court of the HKSAR (Registrar of the High Court, Mr Simon Kwang) during the first panel discussion later today. With respect to the use of digital means under other HCCH Conventions, taking of evidence by video link has been implemented in the HKSAR for some years. In fact, video-conferencing facilities have been used for remote hearings for suitable civil cases of the High Court since April 3, 2020. I will leave further discussion to our experts at the second panel who will share their insights on how digital means could further enhance efficiency in litigation support under various HCCH Conventions.

Ladies and gentlemen, today's theme is timely as we explore how innovating practices, including digital means, can streamline cross-border document circulation and enhance efficiency in litigation support in the context of the HCCH's Conventions. I hope today's Symposium will allow us all to engage in meaningful exchanges and drive forward the future of private international law. Thank you."
