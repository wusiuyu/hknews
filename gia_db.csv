衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100444.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（八月十一日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在八月三日至九日期間，衞生防護中心錄得七宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，詳情如下：


59歲女病人，過往健康良好，居於屯門區；
70歲男病人，有長期病患，居於元朗區；
69歲男病人，有長期病患，居於北區；
70歲男病人，有長期病患，居於東區；
63歲男病人，有長期病患，居於觀塘區；
99歲女病人，有長期病患，居於中西區；及
70歲男病人，有長期病患，居於南區。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示七宗個案全部屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這些個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至八月九日，今年錄得103宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

二零二五年七月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100459.htm,"政府統計處今日（八月十一日）發表二零二五年七月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年六月在收縮區域的41.6上升至二零二五年七月的42.1，而未來一個月（即二零二五年八月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.5。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但不少統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年七月較上月上升，特別是地產業（從44.2上升至46.2）及商用服務業（從43.5上升至44.8）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數在二零二五年七月維持在45.0，而未來一個月（即二零二五年八月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.0。

評論

政府發言人表示，七月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均略為改善。同時，整體就業情況維持大致穩定。

展望未來，外圍環境不確定性高企，將繼續影響本地營商氣氛。然而，本地經濟表現強韌，加上亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，應可提供支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for July 2025,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100461.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (August 11) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for July 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 41.6 in June 2025 in the contractionary zone to 42.1 in July 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. August 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.5. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in July 2025 as compared with previous month for many surveyed sectors, particularly for the real estate (from 44.2 to 46.2) and business services (from 43.5 to 44.8).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades remained at 45.0 in July 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. August 2025) was 47.0.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month's time both improved slightly in July. Meanwhile, the overall employment situation remained largely stable.

  Looking ahead, the elevated uncertainties in the external environment would continue to affect the local business sentiment. Nonetheless, the resilient local economy and steady economic growth in Asia, particularly in the Mainland, should provide support. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100447.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 11) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From August 3 to 9, the CHP recorded seven community-acquired LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


A 59-year-old female patient with good past healthliving in Tuen Mun District;
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Yuen Long District;
A 69-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in North District;
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Eastern District;
A 63-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Kwun Tong District;
A 99-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Central and Western District; and
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Southern District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that all seven cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of August 9, 103 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

100 candidates for 2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections and 10 nominees determined as validly nominated,2025-08-11 14:20,2025-08-11 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100344.htm,"The Candidate Eligibility Review Committee (CERC) today (August 11) announced that the nomination of 100 candidates for the Election Committee (EC) Subsector By-elections and 10 nominations for EC members have been determined as valid. In addition, the CERC also determined eight registrations of ex-officio EC members as valid.

Candidates nominated for EC subsectors election

As regards the 93 vacancies in the EC membership to be returned by the 2025 EC Subsector By-elections, by the close of nominations on August 4, the Returning Officers (ROs) received a total of 101 nomination forms for candidates. Upon review, the CERC has determined 100 candidates as validly nominated. One candidate had passed away during the nomination period. The CERC thus determined his nomination as invalid in accordance with relevant electoral law.

Members returned by nominations for EC subsectors

As for the 10 members to be returned through supplementary nominations by designated bodies, the ROs received a total of eight nomination forms submitted by designated bodies, involving 11 nominees. According to section 12(2) of the Electoral Affairs Commission (Electoral Procedure)(Election Committee) Regulation (Cap. 541I), the CERC is only required to determine the validity of nominations for the number that are necessary for filling the assigned seats of the subsector-concerned. In this connection, the CERC has determined 10 nominations, according to the priorities indicated by the designated bodies, are sufficient for filling the number of seats assigned to the subsectors. The CERC had not determined the eligibility of an additional nominee.

Registrations of ex-officio EC members

In accordance with section 5J of the Schedule to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance (Cap. 569), a person holding a specified office under Part 2A of the Schedule may register as an ex-officio EC member. If the specified person concerned is not eligible to be registered as an ex-officio member or is the holder of more than one specified office, he/she may designate another person who is holding an office in a relevant body in relation to the specified office to be registered as anex-officio member.

The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) has received eight registrations for ex-officio members. Upon review, the CERC has determined that these eight registrations are valid. The subsectors and specified offices involved are listed below:

衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案,2025-08-10 17:30,2025-08-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/10/P2025081000452.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月十日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得五宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案，以及一宗可能個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

鑑於香港出現多宗輸入個案，存在經蚊子引致二代本地傳播的風險。衞生防護中心昨日已發信提醒醫生，為臨床症狀符合基孔肯雅熱的患者安排檢測，不論其旅遊史。根據臨床判斷，亦應考慮為有任何基孔肯雅熱症狀並有到訪受影響地區旅遊史的患者進行檢測。中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測，以確保及早診斷。

衞生署已加強對不同群組有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作。中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並向旅客派發宣傳單張。港口衞生科人員近日亦已提醒港鐵公司、跨境巴士和客輪公司營辦商及機場管理局等加強防控蚊患措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。長者健康外展分隊已透過超過300個為長者及照顧者提供的健康推廣活動推廣預防基孔肯雅熱的資訊。此外，長者健康服務亦安排在十八區的長者健康中心派發相關的單張，讓長者了解其症狀及加強防患基孔肯雅熱的意識。家庭健康服務亦在轄下的母嬰健康院提醒孕婦及嬰幼兒照顧者有關預防基孔肯雅熱的注意事項。學生健康服務會在轄下的學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心向學生派發宣傳單張，讓他們了解基孔肯雅熱的症狀。

健康促進處致力透過不同途徑向市民宣傳預防蚊子傳播的疾病（包括基孔肯雅熱）的健康信息，包括於全港各區設置資訊站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/other/events/476.html），透過不同的線上及線下渠道發放有關健康資訊，並適時根據最新情況更新內容。為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。健康促進處亦聯絡與少數族裔相關的持份者（如提供服務的非政府機構及宗教團體等），向他們派發相關健康資料，讓更多市民獲得防蚊的資訊，共同預防基孔肯雅熱的傳播。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

中心建議市民使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食物環境衞生署（食環署）呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today,2025-08-10 17:30,2025-08-10 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/10/P2025081000453.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 10) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the CF cases in recent days. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of five CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases, and one probable case has been recorded. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

In view of the occurrence of multiple imported cases in Hong Kong, the risk of secondary local transmission via mosquitoes exists. The CHP has issued a letter yesterday to remind doctors to arrange testing for patients with clinically compatible presentations of CF regardless of travel history. Testing should also be considered for patients with any symptoms of CF and a travel history to affected areas, based on clinical judgment. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch has been providing free testing to ensure rapid diagnosis.

The DH has enhanced publicity and education efforts regarding CF targeting different groups. The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, and also distributes leaflets to travellers. The Port Health Division staff has recently reminded MTR Corporation, cross-boundary coach and ferry companies operators, and the Airport Authority to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness of the elderly on preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, and reminding residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service has promoted information of CF prevention at more than 300 health promotion activities provided to the elderly and their carers. In addition, the Elderly Health Service has arranged for the distribution of relevant leaflets at Elderly Health Centres across the 18 districts, with a view to helping the elderly to learn about the symptoms of CF and enhance their awareness of prevention of CF. The Family Health Service has also advised pregnant women and infant carers at its Maternal and Child Health Centres about precautions for preventing CF. The Student Health Service will distribute promotional leaflets to students at its Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres so that students could learn more about symptoms of CF.

The Health Promotion Branch is committed to disseminating health information on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases (including CF) to the public through multiple channels. Measures include setting up Info Stations across various districts in Hong Kong (www.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html) and distributing relevant health messages through different online and offline platforms, with content updated as appropriate in light of the latest development. To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into ten ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite. The Health Promotion Branch has also contacted stakeholders serving ethnic minority groups (such as non-governmental organisations and religious groups) to distribute relevant health materials, so that more members of the public can access anti-mosquito information and work together to prevent the spread of CF.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The CHP recommends that the public properly use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients to effectively prevent mosquito bites. The following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and alsoMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
