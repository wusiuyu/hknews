Speech by FS at AVPN Global Conference 2025 (English only) (with photos/video),2025-09-09 12:18,2025-09-09 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900388.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the AVPN Global Conference 2025 today (September 9):

Ms Batra (Chief Executive Officer of AVPN, Ms Naina Batra), Winfried (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC), Mr Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning.

  On behalf of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to you all.

  The AVPN conference brings together some of the most influential minds in philanthropy, family offices and impact investing. I would like to express my sincere thanks to AVPN and the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust for hosting this impactful event right here in Hong Kong.

  You are here because you all recognise a profound shift in the global investment narrative. You are here because you know the importance of forging partnerships and breaking silos. And you are here because Hong Kong stands as a global centre and a strategic hub for philanthropy, sustainable finance and impact investing.

  Today marks Day 2 of Hong Kong Green Week, and I’m delighted that impact investing is front and centre. This is an area that Hong Kong has made significant strides in recent years. As a global financial and business centre, and the gateway connecting the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world, we have been doing well, particularly for the financial markets over the past year or so. But we know that doing well alone is no longer enough. The imperative of our time is clear: we must do good while doing well.

The Asian opportunity

  Indeed, Asia presents both an enormous need, and a tremendous opportunity, for impact investing.

  To put it into perspective: Asia is home to around 60 per cent of the world’s population and is undergoing an unprecedented economic transformation. Yet, the region is also highly vulnerable to natural disasters. In 2022, for example, 140 disasters struck this continent, resulting in economic damage equivalent to the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of Myanmar.

  The UN (United Nations) has estimated that Asia requires around US$1.5 trillion in annual investments to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Apparently, the gap between need and available private capital is vast.

  Globally, the impact investing market has expanded rapidly, with AUM (assets under management) reaching US$1.6 trillion in 2024, more than double the total in 2020. The amount is projected to reach US$6 trillion by 2031. Yet, capital allocation for impact investing remains uneven. Studies show that North America accounts for 47 per cent, Europe 23 per cent, while South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia combined account for less than 15 per cent.

  But within this gap lies hope and immense potential. Asia is home to a fast-growing generation of wealth holders. According to market analysis, the region counted over 850 000 high-net-worth individuals in 2024. Many are not just wealthy entrepreneurs or heirs to fortunes. They are impact-minded leaders who seek to define their legacy through positive social and environmental change.

  With these trends and challenges, the key question is: How can we better connect opportunities with capital where it is needed most?

Hong Kong: a platform for purposeful capital

  This is exactly where Hong Kong comes in.

  Hong Kong has always been a super connector. A conduit for global capital and a value adder. We are built for this.

  Our world-class financial and legal systems as well as top-notch professional services are underpinned by the “one country, two systems” framework. We consistently rank among the world’s top cities, from business competitiveness to economic freedom, and from innovation prowess to talent quality. These make us uniquely positioned to serve as a launch pad for purpose-driven investments.

  For philanthropists and social businesses, Hong Kong offers access to global networks and best practices, institutions and talent, and a diverse pool of impact-first capital.

  One example is the Impact Link, launched by the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy last year. This platform connects donors and family offices with high-impact charitable initiatives, matching capital with projects of worthy causes. Our city is also home to a vibrant network of charitable organisations, NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and international foundations. They, of course, include the HKJC Charities Trust, which may well be Hong Kong’s largest charity donor.

  In fact, over the past three years, tax deductible charitable donations made by individuals and businesses stood at about HK$40 billion.

  We are magnifying this impact through proactive policies, such as providing tax concessions and attracting more family offices which are forces for good. And our policy statement for developing family offices offers a clear roadmap to support the growth of family offices.

  Our ESG (environmental, social and governance) and green finance ecosystem is one of the most vibrant in Asia. In 2024, Hong Kong issued over US$80 billion in sustainable debt, with green bonds making up 45 per cent of the regional total. Today, more than 200 ESG funds are authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission with a combined AUM exceeding US$140 billion.

  We are also innovating. From tokenised green bonds to more thematic ESG ETFs (exchange traded funds), we are expanding the suite of financial instruments and product offerings.

  Beyond finance, the Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, is fast rising as the world’s leading innovation cluster. Start-ups here are developing transformative solutions, ranging from AI-powered greentech to medtech and inclusive fintech, all designed to solve real-world problems and promote equitable development.

  Indeed, across the Chinese Mainland and Asia, a new wave of innovation is emerging, brimming with tech start-ups and enterprises. They are offering scalable, tech-enabled solutions to address our most pressing challenges like climate change.

  With these advantages, Hong Kong is keen to create a seamless ecosystem where capital can be efficiently structured, deployed and scaled for maximum sustainable impact, both within our region and across the globe.

  At our core, Hong Kong believes in collaboration. We are committed to building strong, cross-sector partnerships that create value for all.

Step forward: showcasing our capability

  In this connection, understanding how to mobilise impact capital effectively is crucial. I am pleased to note that tomorrow, our Financial Services Development Council will launch a special report right here at this conference.

  That report will highlight real-world case studies that showcase how Hong Kong is already serving as a powerful agent in mobilising impact capital. I hope you will find inspiration and actionable insight in its pages. 

Conclusion

  Ladies and gentlemen, we live in uncertain times. But gatherings like this one give me tremendous hope. 

  You are the change makers, the architects of a more inclusive and sustainable future. And Hong Kong is your committed partner. We are ready, willing and uniquely positioned to help you channel capital for purpose, connect ambition with action, and turn the vision of doing good into a reality that changes lives.

  Enjoy the rich discussions over the next few days. Let us learn from one another, forge new partnerships, and leave here ready to build a better world, together. Thank you."

車輛領牌新規例十二月二十二日實施　及時妥善處理未領牌車輛免被檢控,2025-09-09 11:50,2025-09-09 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090400327.htm,"運輸署今日（九月九日）表示，將於十二月二十二日實施新的車輛登記及領牌制度，加強規管長期未領牌的車輛。在新制度下，未領牌車輛將一直登記在車主名下，車主須為其車輛負上責任。新規例同時引入新罪行以提高阻嚇力，從源頭解決不當棄置車輛的問題。

運輸署發言人說：「由十二月二十二日起，署方將向兩年或以上未領牌車輛的登記車主發出通知書，要求車主必須在發出通知書日期的三個月內為車輛領牌，或把車輛拆毀或永久送離香港後向署方取消登記。車主須及時妥善處理車輛，以免觸犯法例。」

如車主在該三個月通知期屆滿前仍不採取行動，即屬犯罪。首次定罪最高可罰款10,000元和監禁三個月；其後每次定罪最高可罰款25,000元和監禁六個月。除非已繳付罰款，否則運輸署可根據法庭命令：（一）拒絕向被定罪車主發出或續發駕駛執照；（二）不處理涉事車輛的過戶申請；及（三）拒絕向涉事車輛或被定罪車主名下其他車輛發出車輛牌照。

個別車主如有實際困難而未能在三個月通知期屆滿前採取所需行動，或有合理理由不為其車輛領牌，可向運輸署申請豁免。一般而言，以下三種情況可獲豁免：（一）等待零件維修送驗後續牌的車輛；（二）車齡30年或以上、正妥善保存作私人收藏而不會在路上使用的車輛；或（三）妥善保存於車輛經銷商作寄賣的車輛。車主如有其他合理理由，可向署方提出；署方會視乎個案情況考慮是否批出豁免。申請豁免的資格和指引將於稍後公布。

發言人提醒車主，即使未為車輛領牌或獲批豁免，車輛仍會一直登記在其名下，車主須繼續承擔車輛引起的所有法律責任。運輸署自二○二四年十二月起透過車主於辦理牌照申請時提供的電子聯絡方式，向車輛牌照到期前一個月、剛逾期或已逾期超過兩年的車主發出短訊或電郵，提醒登記車主必須適時續領車輛牌照或妥善處置車輛。

同時，署方已加強宣傳和公眾教育，提醒車主及早處理名下兩年或以上未領牌車輛。車主可善用運輸署的「牌證易」網上平台，查閱名下車輛牌照屆滿日期、處理各類牌照事務及妥善處理名下未領牌車輛。市民可參閱運輸署網頁了解詳情，或致電熱線2804 2600查詢。"
Handle unlicensed vehicles properly in timely manner to avoid prosecutions following new vehicle licensing regulation taking effect on December 22,2025-09-09 11:50,2025-09-09 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090400353.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (September 9) said that the new vehicle registration and licensing regime will take effect on December 22 to strengthen regulations on prolonged unlicensed vehicles. Under the new regime, unlicensed vehicles will remain registered under the name of owners, who will continue to be held responsible for their vehicles. A new offence will also be introduced to heighten deterrence against improper abandoning of vehicles for addressing the problem at the source.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""Starting from December 22, we will issue a notice to registered owners of vehicles unlicensed for two years or more. Vehicle owners must, within three months of the date of notice, renew the licence, or cancel the registration of such vehicles with the TD after scrapping them or permanently shipping them out of Hong Kong. They should handle their vehicles properly and in a timely manner to avoid contravening the law.""

  Failing to take action upon expiry of the three-month notice period will constitute an offence. The maximum penalty for the first conviction will be a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months. For each subsequent conviction, the maximum penalty will be a $25,000 fine and six months' imprisonment. Unless the fine is paid, the TD may, subject to the court's order, (1) refuse to issue or renew the driving licence of a convicted vehicle owner; (2) take no action on any application for transfer of ownership of the subject vehicle; and (3) refuse to issue a vehicle licence to the subject vehicle or any other vehicles under the convicted owner's name.

  Individual vehicle owners who have a genuine difficulty in taking the required actions within the three-month notice period or have reasonable grounds for not licensing their vehicles may apply for an exemption from the TD. In general, exemptions may be granted under the following three scenarios: (1) vehicles pending spare parts for maintenance and examination before licence renewal; (2) vehicles manufactured for 30 years or more, properly stored as a private collection and not used on roads; or (3) vehicles properly stored by a car dealer and consigned for sale. Vehicle owners may provide other reasonable grounds for the TD's consideration of granting an exemption based on individual cases. The eligibility criteria and guidelines for exemption will be announced later.

  The spokesman reminded vehicle owners that, even when a vehicle remains unlicensed or is granted an exemption, it will remain registered under their name and they have to continue to bear all legal liabilities associated with it. Since December 2024 the TD has started issuing SMS messages or emails to registered owners whose vehicle licences will expire in one month, have just expired or have expired for two years via the e-contact means they provided in their licensing applications, to remind them that they must renew their vehicle licence or properly handle their vehicles in time.

  The TD has also stepped up publicity and public education to remind vehicle owners to take action early for vehicles unlicensed for two years or more. Vehicle owners may make use of the e-Licensing Portal to check the vehicle licence expiry date, handle licensing matters and take proper action on their unlicensed vehicles. Members of the public may refer to the TD's website for details, or call the hotline at 2804 2600 for enquiries."

  Good morning. I am very delighted to join you today at the 2025 Hong Kong-Asean Summit.

  This is, I'm pleased to say, the fourth consecutive year I've addressed this Summit, an annual event created to put a bright spotlight on the dynamic and mutually rewarding ties between Hong Kong and ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

  Allow me first to welcome Minister Loke, our good friend from Malaysia, together with many other senior government officials, business leaders and distinguished guests from ASEAN and beyond.

  Indeed, some 400 of you are here today, with another 300 or so taking in this year's Summit virtually, and you'll be hearing from 20 prominent speakers from some 30 countries and regions. Your presence underscores the enduring strength of our partnership, and shared commitment, to enhancing regional development and prosperity.

  There are good reasons for our partnership. The recent rise of protectionism and unilateralism is creating significant uncertainties in international trade, damaging trading systems and escalating geopolitical risks.

  In such trying times, it is all the more important for like-minded economies to work together, upholding multilateralism with an open, rules-based order. Hong Kong has long been a free port and a champion of multilateral trade. That's why we attach great importance to our relations with ASEAN, whose 10 member states share similar values and a clear commitment to promoting free and open trade.

  And that's why the ASEAN region was the destination of my first overseas visit, after assuming office some three years ago. Over the years, I'm glad to have led high-level business delegations from Hong Kong to visit seven different ASEAN countries, concluding some 90 documents of co-operation on various fronts.

   ASEAN, after all, is the third-most populous region and fifth-largest economy in the world.

  For 15 years in a row, ASEAN has been Hong Kong's second-largest merchandise trading partner. Last year, our trade was valued at more than US$165 billion, up almost 15 per cent over the previous year.

  And our merchandise trade in the first half of this year continued to soar, I'm delighted to note, rising nearly one quarter. Our services trade is equally cheering, climbing about 30 per cent, year-on-year, and reaching US$18 billion in 2023, making ASEAN our third-largest services trading partner.

  We like to invest in each other's opportunities, too. ASEAN is Hong Kong's third-largest outward investment destination, and sixth-largest source of inward direct investment.

  More than our long years of friendship, the robust relationship between us is backed by the ASEAN-Hong Kong, China Free Trade Agreement and its related Investment Agreement. They have been in full force since 2021, with the linked Economic and Technical Co-operation Work Programme focused on ensuring continuing trade and investment growth.

  Last year, the number of offices set up in Hong Kong with parent companies located in ASEAN grew 13 per cent. Some 730 ASEAN companies now call Hong Kong home.

  There are plenty of good reasons for ASEAN companies to look to Hong Kong for their future. Long the world's freest economy, Hong Kong was also the world's seventh-largest merchandise trading entity last year.

  This year, the International Institute for Management Development's World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Hong Kong third, globally, in competitiveness. That is the second year, in a row, that we've gone up two places in this ranking, and our first return to the global top three since 2019.

  More good news. Just this morning, the Institute released its annual World Talent Ranking, in which Hong Kong's ranking rose to fourth, globally, and first in the Asia Pacific. This is our highest-ever position in the ranking, having climbed up five places from last year. Indeed, our ranking rose 12 places over the past two years, a clear testament to the HKSAR Government's enhanced efforts in education and talent development.

  The World Talent Ranking, I'm pleased to add, recognises Hong Kong's outstanding academic achievement, ranking us first in the indicator ""Graduates in Sciences"".

  Yes, Hong Kong is the only city in the globe with as many as five universities in the world's top 100. Our excellent institutions nurture world-class scientists and research talent in different disciplines.

  Leveraging that strength, Hong Kong is fast rising as an innovation and technology hub. Earlier this month, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster topped the world - for the first time - in the World Intellectual Property Organization's annual Global Innovation Index.

  All three cities in the cluster are core cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a cluster city development that brings together a population of 87 million.

  By synergising Hong Kong's research prowess with the Mainland's innovation and manufacturing capabilities, we are committed to becoming one of the world's leading I&T centres.

  And, as one of the world's top three international financial centres, Hong Kong has the liquidity, along with the angel investors, venture capital and private equity funds, to drive innovation and innovative companies. These, ladies and gentlemen, present far-reaching opportunities for ASEAN companies and entrepreneurs looking to tap into the vast and promising markets of the Mainland.

  And we are continually seeking to expand our co-operation and ties. In addition to our Economic and Trade Offices in Singapore, Jakarta and Bangkok, we are working closely with the Malaysian Government to open a fourth ASEAN-based Office in Kuala Lumpur.

  I am pleased to note that excellent progress has been made towards establishing this new office, and I am sure our ties with ASEAN will reach another level entirely with the new addition.

  Then there's the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade bloc. The theme of this year's Summit, ""Bridging Horizons, Building Futures"", seems to me to speak to the value and contributions Hong Kong will add to the Partnership with our accession.

  That includes serving as a multilevel bridge between the Chinese Mainland and ASEAN. Ladies and gentlemen, I count on your continuing support in realising Hong Kong's bid for accession.

  Trade and investment aside, we enjoy close people-to-people ties and exchanges. We have relaxed the criteria for nationals of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam in applying for multi-entry visas for travel and business. And we have extended their validity period from two to three years.

  We are, as well, providing self-service immigration clearance for invited visitors participating in business, development and related activities from all ASEAN countries.

  Those ""related activities"" include enjoying the world-class arts, culture and entertainment, everywhere you turn, in Hong Kong, a world city rising as the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. Sports exchange and excitement, too, thanks to our world-class facilities, including new, state-of-the-art Kai Tak Sports Park. Or a fond exchange with our six cuddly giant pandas, right here in Ocean Park.

  Before I go, allow me to mention that Hong Kong's Belt and Road Summit, the 10th anniversary edition, opens tomorrow. The annual event attracts government officials and business leaders and investors from Hong Kong, the Mainland and throughout the region, including those from ASEAN states.

  Hong Kong, of course, plays a key role in our country's Belt and Road Initiative. It's part of our continuing contribution to regional connectivity. I look forward to seeing you there.

  Because we believe in partnership. Despite all the uncertainties and unease across the globe, Hong Kong holds on to the belief that free trade is the backbone for boosting global output. It's the key ingredient for a more interconnected, peaceful and productive world economy.

  As Hong Kong and ASEAN deepen our collaboration, we are paving the way for stronger economic partnerships and enhanced regional connectivity, creating opportunities for shared growth and prosperity. Together, we are not afraid of storms. United, we will sail our ships, through thick and thin, whether it is Typhoon Nine, Typhoon Eight, or Typhoon Eight-Goodbye.

  In closing, my thanks to the South China Morning Post for once again hosting this significant annual gathering, made for business, for networking, for creating partnerships and enduring co-operation. And that, ladies and gentlemen, will ensure that today's trying times soon give way to inspiring times. Rewarding times for us all.

  I wish you the best of business and a memorable stay in Hong Kong.

  Thank you."
商務及經濟發展局局長在海南自貿港推介暨政策解讀會致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-09-09 11:18,2025-09-09 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900350.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（九月九日）在海南自貿港推介暨政策解讀會的致辭全文：

尊敬的馮飛書記（海南省委書記）、尹宗華副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李永勝副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好，今天很高興出席海南省在香港舉辦的海南自貿港推介暨政策解讀會，首先我謹代表特區政府歡迎馮書記率團訪問香港。

海南與香港地緣相近，人員互動、物流和資金流的往來都十分頻繁。香港是海南最主要的外資來源地，不少香港企業在海南開展業務。單單是去年，海南新成立的香港企業就有700多家，實際利用香港直接投資的金額超過150億人民幣，增幅超過9%。

港商在海南的投資十分廣泛，涵蓋了商業地產、醫療健康、旅遊零售等多個領域，瓊港合作近年更上一層樓，擴展到金融合作、專業資格認證、青年創業等不同領域。同時，海南近年也積極投資香港，連續三年在香港發行離岸人民幣債券，海南省更是內地第一個使用香港融資平台和專業服務發債的省份。

特區政府非常重視瓊港兩地的合作交流。今年三月，在行政長官訪問海南期間，與馮書記一同見證了特區政府和海南省簽署的一系列加強雙邊合作的備忘錄，涵蓋經貿投資、金融、數據安全流動、旅遊，以及人才交流等五個領域，推動海南自貿港構建，同時也為香港的專業服務和資本提供更廣闊的發展空間，實現香港與海南省企業一同拼船出海，全面發揮瓊港兩地的優勢，一同走向世界市場。

海南自貿港的建設將於今年十二月十八日正式啓動，迎來歷史一刻，一系列自由便利的進出措施，將擴大海南對外開放的水平，助力加強包括人流、物流和資金流等要素在海南自由流通。海南省這次在香港舉辦的政策解讀會正逢其時，加深香港企業對海南自貿港發展的了解，同時推動更廣、更深、更高水平的交流合作，共同發展新質生產力。

在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，特區政府會全力發揮好香港作為「超級連繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，發揮香港所長，促進粵港澳大灣區與海南自貿港的聯動發展，同時引入國際項目到海南、服務海南資金投資海外市場，與海南創造更多互利共贏的合作，共同為國家的高質量發展和提升經濟動能作出貢獻。

謝謝。"

å°æ¬çæä¸»ä»» (CPC Committee Member and Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Mr Li Zhen)ãChairman Gao (Chairman of GTI, Mr Gao Tongqing), Chairman Ehrlich (Chairman of GTI, Mr Craig Ehrlich), Mr Li (Executive Vice President of China Mobile, Mr Li Huidi), Professor Chao (Vice President (Research and Innovation) of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Professor Christopher Chao), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning! It is my great pleasure to speak again at the GTI Forum on Digital Intelligence · Hong Kong. For those who are visiting Hong Kong for the first time, a big welcome to Hong Kong, and I wish you a pleasant stay to explore the wonders of this vibrant city.

  The recent announcement by the World Intellectual Property Organization ranking the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster as number one in its index of the world's top 100 innovation clusters in the Global Innovation Index 2025 is a resounding affirmation of our region's visionary commitment to innovation and technology (I&T). This recognition not only celebrates our collective achievements, but also reinforces Hong Kong's strategic position in the global I&T landscape.
 
  Thanks to GTI, who have chosen Hong Kong to host the forum for two consecutive years. This reflects not only GTI's recognition of Hong Kong's crucial role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"", but also the confidence that you have placed in Hong Kong as a promising, global hub of I&T.

  Among the many emerging technologies in this I&T era, artificial intelligence (AI) has been at its forefront in recent years. The focus of the GTI Forum is no exception, as evidenced from the forum programme, which will take us through the development, opportunities and challenges of AI in the coming two days.

  Recognising the great potential of AI, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government has introduced a number of initiatives to support and drive the local AI ecosystem. On digital infrastructure, our local I&T flagship Cyberport has commenced operation of its AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) since last December to advance AI research and applications. Its computing power will ramp up within this year. Leveraging the AISC, we also provide subsidies to its eligible users, such as local institutions, research and development (R&D) centres, enterprises and start-ups through the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme to encourage the R&D of potential groundbreaking AI.

  Another initiative spearheaded by the Hong Kong SAR Government to support AI R&D is the AIR@InnoHK Research Cluster. It is a collaboration with leading R&D institutions locally and globally, that drives advancements in AI and robotics technologies. The cluster has set up 15 R&D labs, including the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center, HKGAI in short. In this February, the HKGAI launched its homegrown AI large language model, and integrated it into a generative AI document processing copilot application (HKPilot). The AI copilot application has been widely adopted for trial use within the Government in respect of drafting, translation and summarising of documents.

  In addition, we have further earmarked $1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI R&D Institute. This new institute, which is targeted to be set up in 2026, will spearhead AI development and industry applications in Hong Kong, as well as to facilitate upstream R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes and expand application scenarios.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the above are just a few examples of our I&T initiatives to foster a vibrant local AI ecosystem. I am confident that with the concerted efforts of the Government, industry, academia, research institutes and investment sectors, our AI ecosystem will thrive and bring promising opportunities to Hong Kong, Mainland China and the world.

  Before I close, may I wish the GTI Forum another year of great success and everyone a rewarding journey. Thank you."

  The recent announcement by the World Intellectual Property Organization ranking the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster as number one in its index of the world's top 100 innovation clusters in the Global Innovation Index 2025 is a resounding affirmation of our region's visionary commitment to innovation and technology (I&T). This recognition not only celebrates our collective achievements, but also reinforces Hong Kong's strategic position in the global I&T landscape.
 
  Thanks to GTI, who have chosen Hong Kong to host the forum for two consecutive years. This reflects not only GTI's recognition of Hong Kong's crucial role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"", but also the confidence that you have placed in Hong Kong as a promising, global hub of I&T.

  Among the many emerging technologies in this I&T era, artificial intelligence (AI) has been at its forefront in recent years. The focus of the GTI Forum is no exception, as evidenced from the forum programme, which will take us through the development, opportunities and challenges of AI in the coming two days.

  Recognising the great potential of AI, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government has introduced a number of initiatives to support and drive the local AI ecosystem. On digital infrastructure, our local I&T flagship Cyberport has commenced operation of its AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) since last December to advance AI research and applications. Its computing power will ramp up within this year. Leveraging the AISC, we also provide subsidies to its eligible users, such as local institutions, research and development (R&D) centres, enterprises and start-ups through the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme to encourage the R&D of potential groundbreaking AI.

  Another initiative spearheaded by the Hong Kong SAR Government to support AI R&D is the AIR@InnoHK Research Cluster. It is a collaboration with leading R&D institutions locally and globally, that drives advancements in AI and robotics technologies. The cluster has set up 15 R&D labs, including the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center, HKGAI in short. In this February, the HKGAI launched its homegrown AI large language model, and integrated it into a generative AI document processing copilot application (HKPilot). The AI copilot application has been widely adopted for trial use within the Government in respect of drafting, translation and summarising of documents.

  In addition, we have further earmarked $1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI R&D Institute. This new institute, which is targeted to be set up in 2026, will spearhead AI development and industry applications in Hong Kong, as well as to facilitate upstream R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes and expand application scenarios.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the above are just a few examples of our I&T initiatives to foster a vibrant local AI ecosystem. I am confident that with the concerted efforts of the Government, industry, academia, research institutes and investment sectors, our AI ecosystem will thrive and bring promising opportunities to Hong Kong, Mainland China and the world.

  Before I close, may I wish the GTI Forum another year of great success and everyone a rewarding journey. Thank you."
Hong Kong leaps to fourth place and ranks first in Asia in World Talent Ranking 2025,2025-09-09 09:40,2025-09-09 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090800827.htm,"The International Institute for Management Development (IMD) published the World Talent Ranking 2025 today (September 9). Hong Kong's ranking leapt markedly to fourth globally from ninth last year, marking the highest-ever ranking and ranking first in Asia.

  For the second consecutive year, Hong Kong improved across all three ranked talent competitiveness factors. Hong Kong's ranking rose by eight places to 20th in ""Appeal"", and by one place for both ""Readiness"" and ""Investment and Development"" to third and 12th respectively. Among the indicators, Hong Kong continued to top the ranking in the percentage of graduates in sciences. The city rose to third in the availability of finance skills, and ranked fifth in the remuneration of management as well as effectiveness of management education.

A Government spokesman said, ""Hong Kong ranking first in Asia in the IMD's World Talent Ranking is clear evidence that the policies and measures of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in education, innovation and technology (I&T), and talent admission have found the right direction and are getting results. Hong Kong's post-secondary education is highly internationalised and diversified. The city boasts five of the world's top 100 universities with outstanding research talent, making it an international hub for exchanges and collaboration among high-calibre talent. The Government strives to establish the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand and stays committed to investing in education. Its unwavering support for institutions' continuous innovation and optimisation helps give full play to the strengths of first-class universities, and ties in with the institutions' capacity expansion and quality enhancement. The Government has also introduced a series of specific policies and measures such as scholarship programmes to attract quality talent from around the world and nurture local talent, with a view to consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international post-secondary education hub, and aligning with the national strategy of becoming a leading country in education.""

The HKSAR Government fully understands the vital role of talent in technology and other developments, and announced in the 2024 Policy Address the establishment of the Committee on Education, Technology and Talents, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, to co-ordinate and drive the integrated development of education, technology and talent, and to formulate policies to attract and cultivate talent, foster the development of technologies, as well as to promote Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent. In The World Intellectual Property Organization's Global Innovation Index (GII) 2025 top 100 innovation clusters published on September 1, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster came first globally for the first time, which reflects the high international recognition of the I&T capacity of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, reflecting that it is an ideal place for global I&T talent from around the world to develop and grow their careers.

The spokesman said, ""The talent attraction measures of the current-term Government are effective. We will continue to target the manpower demand of Hong Kong's strategic positioning of ""eight centres"" and refine the measures in a timely manner, enhance training of relevant local talent, and at the same time further enhance the diversity of the talent pool and effectiveness of the talent attraction measures to strengthen the talent support for the future development of Hong Kong. As at end-August this year, over 520 000 applications were received under various talent admission schemes, with over 350000 applications approved. Over 230 000 people of talent arrived in Hong Kong through various talent admission schemes over the same period. We welcome the continued arrival of outside quality talent and their family members to boost Hong Kong's labour force, effectively enhance our population structure, replenish the manpower shortfall and inject continuous impetus to Hong Kong's economic growth."""

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-08 19:17,2025-09-08 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800792.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 8), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  ""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 178 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 31 to September 6), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 225 cases (August 24 to 30) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are still experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

周和副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室社會工作部副部長）、葛珮帆主席（智慧城市聯盟督導委員會主席、大灣區低空經濟聯盟創會會長）、楊文銳會長（智慧城市聯盟會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家午安！很高興出席智慧城市聯盟成立十周年暨大灣區低空經濟聯盟成立一周年的慶祝酒會。首先，讓我們一起向兩個聯盟表示最熱烈的祝賀！

過去幾年，在政府與各界的共同努力下，香港在智慧城市建設方面取得了不少扎實的進展。從金融科技到便捷出行，從環境監測到智慧政府，科技正全方位融入我們的生活。它提升了市民的生活質素，也改變了城市的面貌。

十年來，智慧城市聯盟積極建言獻策，匯聚業界和學界等多方力量和資源，推動人才培育、促進公私營協作，為香港的創科發展注入了更多新動能。而大灣區低空經濟聯盟的成立，更是在這個基礎上，推動香港和大灣區在低空經濟領域的協作和發展，為區域融合開創新維度。我對兩個聯盟一直以來的勤奮耕耘和貢獻，表示衷心的感謝！

當前，人工智能正以前所未有的速度驅動科技變革，引領智慧城市進入新的發展階段。香港作為國際金融、貿易和航運中心，正積極把握這一趨勢，全力推進智慧城市建設。這不僅可提升我們國際大都會的競爭力和吸引力，更與香港國際創科中心建設的定位相輔相成。

今日，我想就特區政府智慧城市發展策略中的兩點，即數據與人工智能扼要談談。

第一是數據的運用，即如何讓數據更深度接入生活的各個層面，讓它的價值更全面、更高效的釋放出來。我們的策略圍繞三個關鍵詞：開放、應用和互通。

開放數據，就是為社會各行各業提供智慧轉型的原材料。我們目前提供超過5 600個數據集，年度下載量已經突破600億次。由發展局開發的一站式空間數據共享平台就是其中一個例子，它在三年前開始啓用，以可視化地圖方式，提供規劃、地政、屋宇、交通、人口、工程等不同範疇的數據，去年數據的下載量超過122萬次，是二○二三年的四倍。這個項目也一直獲得智慧城市聯盟的積極支持。

未來，我們會適時、適度進一步擴大數據開放的範圍。

數據應用方面，特區政府除了在城市管理、交通、環境、社福等方面更廣泛應用數據以支持決策和進行規劃，也希望通過共享數據讓公私營的服務可以更便捷和普惠包容。香港金融管理局推出的商業數據通就是成功案例，讓中小企將其業務數據與銀行分享，便利其融資。自二○二二年推出至今年六月，商業數據通已協助處理超過61 000 宗貸款申請，總額超過500億港元。這個平台更已與政府授權數據交換閘對接，以涵蓋公司註冊處及土地註冊處的數據。根據現有數據的覆蓋範圍，約15萬間本港中小企可受惠於這個平台。

以上的例子自然地把我們帶到數據互通這議題上。事實上，數據互通有助推動低空經濟的發展。我們正研究建立低空飛行三維資訊樞紐，它將銜接空間數據共享平台，通過多元數據的整合，促進跨界別應用。

數據互通還有跨境的面向。在「一國兩制」下，香港同時匯聚內地和國際數據，是我們推動智慧城市發展的獨特優勢，對香港在人工智能、大數據和醫藥產業領域的研究和發展，也有很大的促進作用。在中央相關部委支持下，我們前年已與廣東省制定《大灣區標準合同》（《粵港澳大灣區（內地、香港）個人信息跨境流動標準合同》），促進兩地數據的安全流通。與此同時，我們亦正在河套深港創科園，推動數據以及資金、人才和其他生產要素自由流動的政策。

至於第二點——人工智能（AI）是不得不提的。AI正改變世界，它與各產業深度融合，大大提升生產力、改變產業模式，以及人們消費出行的模式，正深刻重塑企業之間、不同經濟體之間的競爭力，同時也為城市發展帶來質變和量變。AI應用可以減低能源消耗，也可以提供更高效和個性化的服務，這些只是眾多應用場景的實例。特區政府將AI定為核心產業，從算法、算力、數據、資金和人才等五方面加速推動其發展，促進其技術研發與應用，讓AI更廣泛賦能城市運作，提升市民生活質素。

可以預見，數據和人工智能的結合，將開創更多智慧應用場景，為各行各業帶來新動能、新機遇。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，智慧城市聯盟和大灣區低空經濟聯盟自成立以來，一直是特區政府的緊密夥伴。未來，我期待你們在以下三方面進一步助力香港的智慧城市建設。一是鼓勵創新科技的研發與應用，開拓更多應用場景；二是推動政、產、學、研、投全鏈條與城市發展的更緊密結合；三是加強人才培訓與國際交流，提升香港在智慧城市領域的國際影響力和話語權。

最後，我再次感謝兩個聯盟的貢獻，祝願你們竿頭猛進，再創高峰！也祝願今日出席酒會的各位朋友身體健康、事業宏達！謝謝大家！"

第一是數據的運用，即如何讓數據更深度接入生活的各個層面，讓它的價值更全面、更高效的釋放出來。我們的策略圍繞三個關鍵詞：開放、應用和互通。

開放數據，就是為社會各行各業提供智慧轉型的原材料。我們目前提供超過5 600個數據集，年度下載量已經突破600億次。由發展局開發的一站式空間數據共享平台就是其中一個例子，它在三年前開始啓用，以可視化地圖方式，提供規劃、地政、屋宇、交通、人口、工程等不同範疇的數據，去年數據的下載量超過122萬次，是二○二三年的四倍。這個項目也一直獲得智慧城市聯盟的積極支持。

未來，我們會適時、適度進一步擴大數據開放的範圍。

數據應用方面，特區政府除了在城市管理、交通、環境、社福等方面更廣泛應用數據以支持決策和進行規劃，也希望通過共享數據讓公私營的服務可以更便捷和普惠包容。香港金融管理局推出的商業數據通就是成功案例，讓中小企將其業務數據與銀行分享，便利其融資。自二○二二年推出至今年六月，商業數據通已協助處理超過61 000 宗貸款申請，總額超過500億港元。這個平台更已與政府授權數據交換閘對接，以涵蓋公司註冊處及土地註冊處的數據。根據現有數據的覆蓋範圍，約15萬間本港中小企可受惠於這個平台。

以上的例子自然地把我們帶到數據互通這議題上。事實上，數據互通有助推動低空經濟的發展。我們正研究建立低空飛行三維資訊樞紐，它將銜接空間數據共享平台，通過多元數據的整合，促進跨界別應用。

數據互通還有跨境的面向。在「一國兩制」下，香港同時匯聚內地和國際數據，是我們推動智慧城市發展的獨特優勢，對香港在人工智能、大數據和醫藥產業領域的研究和發展，也有很大的促進作用。在中央相關部委支持下，我們前年已與廣東省制定《大灣區標準合同》（《粵港澳大灣區（內地、香港）個人信息跨境流動標準合同》），促進兩地數據的安全流通。與此同時，我們亦正在河套深港創科園，推動數據以及資金、人才和其他生產要素自由流動的政策。

至於第二點——人工智能（AI）是不得不提的。AI正改變世界，它與各產業深度融合，大大提升生產力、改變產業模式，以及人們消費出行的模式，正深刻重塑企業之間、不同經濟體之間的競爭力，同時也為城市發展帶來質變和量變。AI應用可以減低能源消耗，也可以提供更高效和個性化的服務，這些只是眾多應用場景的實例。特區政府將AI定為核心產業，從算法、算力、數據、資金和人才等五方面加速推動其發展，促進其技術研發與應用，讓AI更廣泛賦能城市運作，提升市民生活質素。

可以預見，數據和人工智能的結合，將開創更多智慧應用場景，為各行各業帶來新動能、新機遇。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，智慧城市聯盟和大灣區低空經濟聯盟自成立以來，一直是特區政府的緊密夥伴。未來，我期待你們在以下三方面進一步助力香港的智慧城市建設。一是鼓勵創新科技的研發與應用，開拓更多應用場景；二是推動政、產、學、研、投全鏈條與城市發展的更緊密結合；三是加強人才培訓與國際交流，提升香港在智慧城市領域的國際影響力和話語權。

最後，我再次感謝兩個聯盟的貢獻，祝願你們竿頭猛進，再創高峰！也祝願今日出席酒會的各位朋友身體健康、事業宏達！謝謝大家！"

避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-09-08 18:10,2025-09-08 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800783.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 8) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From August 31 to September 6, the CHP recorded seven LD cases. Among these, two were imported cases and five were community-acquired cases. All of the patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:

Community-acquired cases:

an 82-year-old male patient living in Sai Kung District;
a 54-year-old male patient living in Kwai Tsing District;
a 61-year-old male patient living in Tai Po District;
a 66-year-old male patient living in Kwun Tong District; and
a 69-year-old male patient living in Sham Shui Po District.


Imported cases:

a 49-year-old male patient who travelled to the Mainland during the incubation period; and
a 75-year-old male patient who travelled to the Mainland during the incubation period.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that all seven cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of September 6, 121 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


  The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on September 5 to noon today (September 8), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 315 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 100 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website

八月份第13批涵蓋五個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共13批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，46個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有13區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；


清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
FEHD releases 13th batch of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August,2025-09-08 17:00,2025-09-08 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800655.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (September 8) released the 13th batch of gravidtrap indexes and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering five survey areas, as follows:

  Among the 13th batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering five survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent.

  The FEHD has so far released 13 batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 46 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Thirteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

  Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


  Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

  âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

Seasonal influenza vaccination programmes comprising five new initiatives to enable and increase public participation begin later this month (with photo/video),2025-09-08 16:35,2025-09-08 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800487.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced today (September 8) that the 2025/26 Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (SIV) Programmes, including the SIV School Outreach Programme, the Residential Care Home Vaccination Programme and the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme (VSS), will commence on September 25. Eligible high-risk groups can receive a free or subsidised SIV through various vaccination programmes. Getting vaccinated well before the winter influenza season can effectively protect one's health and that of one's family.

Severe influenza cases drop by 20 per cent as vaccination uptake hits record high
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Vaccination has been scientifically proven to be one of the most effective means to prevent severe cases of seasonal influenza and its complications. It also reduces the risks of in-patient admission and mortality due to seasonal influenza. During the previous influenza season (2024/25), severe influenza cases decreased significantly among adults and children by 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively compared to the influenza seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. School outbreaks of influenza-like illnesses also plummeted by nearly 90 per cent. We believe this is attributable to higher vaccination rates. Under various SIV Programmes, approximately 2.09 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines were administered, marking an increase of over 10 per cent compared to the 2023/24 influenza season and setting a new historical high. Additionally, SIV coverage rates have increased across all age groups,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The local winter influenza season usually begins in January, while the summer surge occurs from July to August. Although no summer influenza has been observed so far this year, the latest surveillance data on the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses, and the influenza-related admission rate in public hospitals, has indicated an upward trend in seasonal influenza activity. The CHP will monitor the trend of influenza activity in the next few weeks.

Five new initiatives of SIV programmes
------------------------------------------------------

""To encourage more residents to receive seasonal influenza vaccines and further increase SIV coverage, the Government will introduce five new initiatives this year to enable public access to seasonal influenza vaccines. These include: expanding the eligible group; further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme to cater to students' needs; providing recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) to better protect elderly living in institutions; launching a pilot scheme to procure part of the seasonal influenza vaccine for private doctors to help stabilise the supply of vaccines; and optimising information dissemination,"" Dr Tsui said.

(1) Expanding eligibility coverage
In addition to previously eligible groups, all individuals aged 18 to 49 with chronic medical conditions are eligible for free or subsidised influenza vaccinations this year, regardless of financial status. The eligible groups and public locations offering free or subsidised SIV are listed in the annex.

(2) Further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme
In early June, the CHP wrote to all secondary schools, primary schools and kindergartens/child care centres in Hong Kong, inviting them to participate in the SIV School Outreach Programme this season. The CHP also highlighted this year's new initiative, i.e. all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV (nasal vaccines)) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools being allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities. Approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) have joined the outreach programme. To safeguard students' health, the CHP will publish a list of schools not participating in the programme on its official website to remind parents to promptly arrange for children in those schools to receive vaccinations from family doctors.

(3) Providing RIV for elderly living in institutions
The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases under the CHP recommended that RIV be preferred for older adults living in residential care homes in order to provide better protection. In light of this, the CHP has successfully procured RIV this year. Through the Residential Care Home Vaccination Programme, all residents of residential care homes for the elderly and residents aged 65 or above in residential care homes for persons with disabilities can receive the vaccine.

(4) Pilot scheme on vaccine procurement for family doctors
To enhance vaccine supply stability and ensure that eligible high-risk groups can receive SIV through the VSS, the DH has also helped procure an additional 100 000 doses of injectable IIV forSpecified VSS Family Doctors this year, in addition to continuing to procure vaccines for itself, the Hospital Authority and relevant institutions. Family doctors who accept this arrangement cannot charge recipients any additional fees, thereby reducing the financial burden on citizens and providing additional incentives for them to receive vaccinations at private clinics.

(5) Optimising information dissemination
The website providing information on private doctors participating in the VSS will be optimised to allow doctors to update their details in real time. The website's search function will also be enhanced to enable members of the public to search for doctors who offer vaccines without any co-payment, or vaccination venues for different types of seasonal influenza vaccines.

To help members of the public manage their personal health records and healthcare services more effectively, and facilitate continuity of care provided by healthcare professionals, eligible individuals aged 18 or above must register for eHealth starting this year to receive subsidised or free seasonal influenza vaccines.

Over 1 000 vaccination sites available for public convenience
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To make vaccinations more accessible, the Government will open all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the 25 District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission, and 74 general outpatient clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Starting from 9am on September 22, parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via the online booking system.

Over 1 500 doctors have applied to join the VSS. The Government will provide a subsidy of $260 per dose of vaccination. For the list of VSS doctors, please visit:apps.hcv.gov.hk/Public/en/SPS/Search.

The sooner one receives seasonal influenza vaccines the better
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases recommended that the vaccine combination for the 2025/26 influenza season should align with the latest recommendations from the World Health Organization. The use of various locally registered trivalent and quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines was recommended, including injectable IIV, LAIV (nasal vaccines) and injectable RIV. For more information, please refer to the Scientific Committee's recommendations.

Dr Tsui reminded the public that it takes approximately two weeks for the body to develop sufficient antibodies for effective protection after receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine. Therefore, for the sake of personal and public health, individuals should get vaccinated as early as possible before the onset of the winter influenza season.

For more information on the SIV programmes, visit the webpage or call the CHP during office hours at 2125 2125."
流感疫苗接種計劃月底展開　五大新猷鼓勵和便利市民接種,2025-09-08 16:35,2025-09-08 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800485.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月八日）宣布，二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃（包括季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃、院舍防疫注射計劃及疫苗資助計劃）將於九月二十五日展開，合資格的高風險群組可透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。在踏入冬季流感季節前盡早接種流感疫苗，方可有效保障自己和家人的健康。

疫苗接種創新高流感重症下跌兩成
————————————————

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據科學實證，接種疫苗是預防季節性流感重症及其併發症的最有效方法之一，亦可減低感染流感而導致入院留醫或死亡的風險。上一年度（二○二四／二五年），成人和兒童嚴重流感個案較新冠疫情前的流感季節分別顯著下跌兩成和六成，學校爆發流感樣疾病更大跌近九成，我們相信是歸功於疫苗接種率上升。衞生署的各項疫苗接種計劃共接種約209萬劑季節性流感疫苗，較前一個流感季節（二○二三／二四年）上升超過一成，創下歷史新高。另外，各年齡組別的疫苗覆蓋率均出現上升。」

本港冬季流感季節一般於一月開始，而夏季高峰期則在七月至八月間出現。雖然本港今年暫未出現夏季流感，但根據最新呼吸道樣本中檢測到季節性流感病毒的百分比和公立醫院流感相關入院率的監測數據，現時季節性流感的活躍程度呈現上升波幅。中心需要留意未來數周的流感趨勢。

疫苗接種計劃五大新猷
——————————

徐醫生說：「為了鼓勵更多市民接種季節性流感疫苗，以進一步提高疫苗覆蓋率，政府今年推出五大新猷，便利市民接種季節性流感疫苗，包括擴大合資格組別人士；進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃以迎合學童的需要；提供重組流感疫苗，更好保護院舍長者；推出先導計劃為私家醫生採購部分季節性流感疫苗以協助穩定疫苗供應；及優化資訊發放。」

（一）擴大資助範圍
除了以往合資格免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗的人士外，所有18至49歲長期病患人士，不論經濟狀況，本年度亦可接種免費或獲資助流感疫苗。合資格人士的組別和可免費接種流感疫苗的公營地點見附件。

​（二）進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃
中心於六月初去信全港中小學、幼稚園／幼兒中心，邀請他們參與新一季的季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，並介紹今年的新措施──所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。目前已有約2 300間學校（99%）參與外展計劃。中心稍後會將不參與計劃的學校名單上載至中心網頁，以提醒有關學校的家長盡快自行安排子女到家庭醫生接種疫苗，守護學童健康。

（三）提供重組流感疫苗予院舍長者
中心轄下的疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會（科學委員會）建議，居住院舍的長者應優先接種重組流感疫苗，以提供更好保護。有見及此，中心今年成功採購了重組流感疫苗，所有安老院舍院友及年滿65歲或以上的殘疾人士院舍院友均可透過「院舍防疫注射計劃」接種。​​

（四）家庭醫生疫苗採購先導計劃
為加強疫苗供應的穩定性，確保合資格高風險群組可透過「疫苗資助計劃」接種季節性流感疫苗，衞生署今年除了繼續為衞生署、醫院管理局及相關機構採購疫苗外，亦額外為參與「疫苗資助計劃」的「指定家庭醫生」協助採購了10萬劑注射式滅活流感疫苗，接受有關安排的家庭醫生不可向接種人士收取任何額外費用，以減低市民於私家診所接種疫苗的經濟負擔，提升接種誘因。

（五）優化資訊發放
提供參加「疫苗資助計劃」私家醫生資訊的網站會優化，讓私家醫生實時更新其資訊。網站亦加強搜尋功能，方便市民選擇有提供免共付額疫苗的醫生，或者尋找不同類型流感疫苗的接種點等。​

另外，為協助市民更有效管理個人健康及醫護服務，同時便利醫護人員提供具連貫性的個人醫療服務，18歲或以上的合資格人士由本年度開始須登記醫健通，才能接種資助或免費季節性流感疫苗。

逾千個接種點方便市民
——————————

為了讓市民更加方便接種疫苗，政府會繼續開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下的25個地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間普通科門診和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可由九月二十二日上午九時起透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

另外，現時有超過1 500名醫生已申請參與「疫苗資助計劃」，政府會提供每劑260元資助，相關醫生名單資料可參閱網頁：apps.hcv.gov.hk/public/tc/SPS/Search。

接種季節性流感疫苗宜早不宜遲
———————————————

科學委員會建議二○二五／二六年度流感季節採用的疫苗組合應與世界衞生組織的最新建議相符。科學委員會建議可使用各種在本地註冊的三價和四價季節性流感疫苗，包括注射式滅活流感疫苗、噴鼻式減活流感疫苗和注射式重組流感疫苗，詳情可參閱科學委員會建議（只有英文）。

Seasonal influenza vaccination programmes comprising five new initiatives to enable and increase public participation begin later this month,2025-09-08 16:35,2025-09-08 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800487.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced today (September 8) that the 2025/26 Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (SIV) Programmes, including the SIV School Outreach Programme, the Residential Care Home Vaccination Programme and the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme (VSS), will commence on September 25. Eligible high-risk groups can receive a free or subsidised SIV through various vaccination programmes. Getting vaccinated well before the winter influenza season can effectively protect one's health and that of one's family.

Severe influenza cases drop by 20 per cent as vaccination uptake hits record high
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Vaccination has been scientifically proven to be one of the most effective means to prevent severe cases of seasonal influenza and its complications. It also reduces the risks of in-patient admission and mortality due to seasonal influenza. During the previous influenza season (2024/25), severe influenza cases decreased significantly among adults and children by 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively compared to the influenza seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. School outbreaks of influenza-like illnesses also plummeted by nearly 90 per cent. We believe this is attributable to higher vaccination rates. Under various SIV Programmes, approximately 2.09 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines were administered, marking an increase of over 10 per cent compared to the 2023/24 influenza season and setting a new historical high. Additionally, SIV coverage rates have increased across all age groups,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The local winter influenza season usually begins in January, while the summer surge occurs from July to August. Although no summer influenza has been observed so far this year, the latest surveillance data on the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses, and the influenza-related admission rate in public hospitals, has indicated an upward trend in seasonal influenza activity. The CHP will monitor the trend of influenza activity in the next few weeks.

Five new initiatives of SIV programmes
------------------------------------------------------

""To encourage more residents to receive seasonal influenza vaccines and further increase SIV coverage, the Government will introduce five new initiatives this year to enable public access to seasonal influenza vaccines. These include: expanding the eligible group; further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme to cater to students' needs; providing recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) to better protect elderly living in institutions; launching a pilot scheme to procure part of the seasonal influenza vaccine for private doctors to help stabilise the supply of vaccines; and optimising information dissemination,"" Dr Tsui said.

(1) Expanding eligibility coverage
In addition to previously eligible groups, all individuals aged 18 to 49 with chronic medical conditions are eligible for free or subsidised influenza vaccinations this year, regardless of financial status. The eligible groups and public locations offering free or subsidised SIV are listed in the annex.

(2) Further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme
In early June, the CHP wrote to all secondary schools, primary schools and kindergartens/child care centres in Hong Kong, inviting them to participate in the SIV School Outreach Programme this season. The CHP also highlighted this year's new initiative, i.e. all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV (nasal vaccines)) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools being allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities. Approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) have joined the outreach programme. To safeguard students' health, the CHP will publish a list of schools not participating in the programme on its official website to remind parents to promptly arrange for children in those schools to receive vaccinations from family doctors.

(3) Providing RIV for elderly living in institutions
The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases under the CHP recommended that RIV be preferred for older adults living in residential care homes in order to provide better protection. In light of this, the CHP has successfully procured RIV this year. Through the Residential Care Home Vaccination Programme, all residents of residential care homes for the elderly and residents aged 65 or above in residential care homes for persons with disabilities can receive the vaccine.

(4) Pilot scheme on vaccine procurement for family doctors
To enhance vaccine supply stability and ensure that eligible high-risk groups can receive SIV through the VSS, the DH has also helped procure an additional 100 000 doses of injectable IIV forSpecified VSS Family Doctors this year, in addition to continuing to procure vaccines for itself, the Hospital Authority and relevant institutions. Family doctors who accept this arrangement cannot charge recipients any additional fees, thereby reducing the financial burden on citizens and providing additional incentives for them to receive vaccinations at private clinics.

(5) Optimising information dissemination
The website providing information on private doctors participating in the VSS will be optimised to allow doctors to update their details in real time. The website's search function will also be enhanced to enable members of the public to search for doctors who offer vaccines without any co-payment, or vaccination venues for different types of seasonal influenza vaccines.

To help members of the public manage their personal health records and healthcare services more effectively, and facilitate continuity of care provided by healthcare professionals, eligible individuals aged 18 or above must register for eHealth starting this year to receive subsidised or free seasonal influenza vaccines.

Over 1 000 vaccination sites available for public convenience
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To make vaccinations more accessible, the Government will open all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the 25 District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission, and 74 general outpatient clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Starting from 9am on September 22, parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via the online booking system.

Over 1 500 doctors have applied to join the VSS. The Government will provide a subsidy of $260 per dose of vaccination. For the list of VSS doctors, please visit:apps.hcv.gov.hk/Public/en/SPS/Search.

The sooner one receives seasonal influenza vaccines the better
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases recommended that the vaccine combination for the 2025/26 influenza season should align with the latest recommendations from the World Health Organization. The use of various locally registered trivalent and quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines was recommended, including injectable IIV, LAIV (nasal vaccines) and injectable RIV. For more information, please refer to the Scientific Committee's recommendations.

Dr Tsui reminded the public that it takes approximately two weeks for the body to develop sufficient antibodies for effective protection after receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine. Therefore, for the sake of personal and public health, individuals should get vaccinated as early as possible before the onset of the winter influenza season.

For more information on the SIV programmes, visit the webpage or call the CHP during office hours at 2125 2125."
流感疫苗接種計劃月底展開　五大新猷鼓勵和便利市民接種（附圖／短片）,2025-09-08 16:35,2025-09-08 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800485.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月八日）宣布，二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃（包括季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃、院舍防疫注射計劃及疫苗資助計劃）將於九月二十五日展開，合資格的高風險群組可透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。在踏入冬季流感季節前盡早接種流感疫苗，方可有效保障自己和家人的健康。

疫苗接種創新高流感重症下跌兩成
————————————————

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據科學實證，接種疫苗是預防季節性流感重症及其併發症的最有效方法之一，亦可減低感染流感而導致入院留醫或死亡的風險。上一年度（二○二四／二五年），成人和兒童嚴重流感個案較新冠疫情前的流感季節分別顯著下跌兩成和六成，學校爆發流感樣疾病更大跌近九成，我們相信是歸功於疫苗接種率上升。衞生署的各項疫苗接種計劃共接種約209萬劑季節性流感疫苗，較前一個流感季節（二○二三／二四年）上升超過一成，創下歷史新高。另外，各年齡組別的疫苗覆蓋率均出現上升。」

本港冬季流感季節一般於一月開始，而夏季高峰期則在七月至八月間出現。雖然本港今年暫未出現夏季流感，但根據最新呼吸道樣本中檢測到季節性流感病毒的百分比和公立醫院流感相關入院率的監測數據，現時季節性流感的活躍程度呈現上升波幅。中心需要留意未來數周的流感趨勢。

疫苗接種計劃五大新猷
——————————

徐醫生說：「為了鼓勵更多市民接種季節性流感疫苗，以進一步提高疫苗覆蓋率，政府今年推出五大新猷，便利市民接種季節性流感疫苗，包括擴大合資格組別人士；進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃以迎合學童的需要；提供重組流感疫苗，更好保護院舍長者；推出先導計劃為私家醫生採購部分季節性流感疫苗以協助穩定疫苗供應；及優化資訊發放。」

（一）擴大資助範圍
除了以往合資格免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗的人士外，所有18至49歲長期病患人士，不論經濟狀況，本年度亦可接種免費或獲資助流感疫苗。合資格人士的組別和可免費接種流感疫苗的公營地點見附件。

​（二）進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃
中心於六月初去信全港中小學、幼稚園／幼兒中心，邀請他們參與新一季的季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，並介紹今年的新措施──所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。目前已有約2 300間學校（99%）參與外展計劃。中心稍後會將不參與計劃的學校名單上載至中心網頁，以提醒有關學校的家長盡快自行安排子女到家庭醫生接種疫苗，守護學童健康。

（三）提供重組流感疫苗予院舍長者
中心轄下的疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會（科學委員會）建議，居住院舍的長者應優先接種重組流感疫苗，以提供更好保護。有見及此，中心今年成功採購了重組流感疫苗，所有安老院舍院友及年滿65歲或以上的殘疾人士院舍院友均可透過「院舍防疫注射計劃」接種。​​

（四）家庭醫生疫苗採購先導計劃
為加強疫苗供應的穩定性，確保合資格高風險群組可透過「疫苗資助計劃」接種季節性流感疫苗，衞生署今年除了繼續為衞生署、醫院管理局及相關機構採購疫苗外，亦額外為參與「疫苗資助計劃」的「指定家庭醫生」協助採購了10萬劑注射式滅活流感疫苗，接受有關安排的家庭醫生不可向接種人士收取任何額外費用，以減低市民於私家診所接種疫苗的經濟負擔，提升接種誘因。

Good afternoon, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a privilege to address you at the 2025 Hong Kong Green Finance Association Annual Forum, themed ""Navigating Climate Finance and Geopolitics: Strategies for Transition"".

As Asia's premier international financial centre, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to channel global capital toward a sustainable future. Amid geopolitical complexities, trade uncertainties, and the urgent need for climate actions, our city is poised to lead the green transition across Asia and beyond.

Let me reaffirm Hong Kong's role as Asia's leading green finance hub. Last year, our green and sustainable debt market, encompassing bonds and loans, surpassed US$84 billion. Green and sustainable bonds alone reached US$43 billion, capturing 45 per cent of the regional market and securing Hong Kong's position as Asia's top-ranked green bond market for seven consecutive years since 2018.

To sustain this leadership, we have adopted a four-pillar strategy in partnership with financial regulators and industry stakeholders, including (i) promoting market development, (ii) fostering financial innovation, (iii) enhancing sustainability transparency, and (iv) nurturing talent and enhancing data. Allow me to elaborate on each.

First pillar: promoting market development

Our Government Sustainable Bond Programme, expanded in May last year to cover sustainability on top of green projects, drives the development of sustainable initiatives by the Government and our green bond market. As of June this year, we have issued approximately HK$240 billion equivalent in green bonds, denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi, euros, and US dollars, with tenors ranging from one to 30 years. These issuances provide a critical benchmark for other issuers in Hong Kong and the region.

The programme supports projects across nine categories, including, for example, renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation, pollution prevention and control, waste management and resource recovery, and more. To date, it has funded 116 local green projects. Our annual Green Bond Report, with the 2025 edition due this month, details the allocation of proceeds and environmental benefits, reinforcing transparency and credibility.

Bond issuances aside, we have also been developing the carbon market. The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) operates Core Climate, an international carbon marketplace enabling transparent trading of carbon credits to support global net-zero transition. It is the only platform offering settlement in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi for international voluntary carbon credits. By the end of last year, Core Climate has attracted 100 participants. Carbon credits traded on the platform are sourced from certified projects for example in forestry, solar, wind, and biomass across Asia, South America, and Africa, aiding governments and businesses in furthering their efforts for low-carbon transition.

The HKEX has also signed Memoranda of Understanding with Mainland China's carbon markets, including the Beijing and Shenzhen Green Exchanges, to share expertise and foster regional collaboration.

Also, Hong Kong has advanced our green finance ecosystem beyond green bonds and the carbon market through the development of a local green classification framework. The Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, covering 12 key economic activities, was launched last year with a view to standardising green classification, reducing greenwashing risks, and enhancing information for decision making by investors. We are engaging the industry to expand the taxonomy, and will widen the scope of sectors and economic activities to include transition elements and additional sustainable activities, reinforcing our role as a leading sustainable and transition finance hub.

Second pillar: fostering financial innovation

Innovation is central to our green finance development strategy, and will inspire more ways to tackle the global problem of climate change. Hong Kong has pioneered the world's first government-issued tokenised green bond and the first multi-currency digital bond. These initiatives demonstrate our leadership in bond markets, green finance, and fintech. Tokenised bonds enable efficient settlement, broaden investor access, enhance interoperability, and improve transparency and efficiency. Continuing the success of our earlier issuance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is preparing our third tokenised bond issuance, advancing our plans for regularised offerings.

To integrate fintech with green finance, we are expanding our green fintech ecosystem, positioning Hong Kong as a regional green fintech hub. The Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group updated the Hong Kong Green Fintech Map this year, providing a comprehensive overview of green fintech companies and services and facilitating adoption and application.

Also, we launched the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme last year, offering early-stage funding to eligible technology companies and research institutes in Hong Kong. So far 60 projects have been approved, advancing commercialisation and adoption.

As for further innovation in carbon market, the HKMA's Project Ensemble explores tokenised deposits and Central Bank Digital Currency for interbank settlement, as well as tokenisation of real-world assets including carbon credits via blockchain. We are also exploring collaborations with central bank peers on enhancing transparency and efficiency in carbon credit trading through blockchain technology.

Third pillar: enhancing sustainability transparency

As sustainable development gains global prominence, ensuring accurate and consistent sustainability information is critical for investors and market participants. In December last year, we launched the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong, outlining a clear path for large publicly accountable entities to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Sustainability Disclosure Standards by 2028.

In June this year, the IFRS Foundation recognised Hong Kong as one of the first jurisdictions to commit to fully adopting ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) standards, underscoring our dedication to transparency in capital markets. This facilitates informed investment decisions and promotes global capital flows via our trusted market.

Also, our Stock Exchange has introduced enhanced climate-related disclosure requirements, based on the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, phasing in for listed companies from the beginning of this year.

As for the support to SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in sustainability reporting, our Steering Group is enhancing the Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for non-listed companies/SMEs. Launched in 2022, the Questionnaire is intended to provide a free and easy-to-use sustainability reporting template to corporates in need, facilitating their understanding of sustainability performance and raising their sustainability profiles to lenders, investors, and supply chain clients. Taking into account industry feedback and latest market developments, the Steering Group is enhancing the Questionnaire to make it more accessible and inclusive. The 2.0 version of the Questionnaire will soon be rolled out on the website of the Steering Group. Please watch out for that. Going forward, we will collaborate with the industry further to promote the usage of the Questionnaire.

Fourth pillar: nurturing talent and enhancing data

Building a skilled workforce is essential for advancing our green finance development. We launched the Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme for local market practitioners, professionals, students, and graduates. By July this year, the scheme has a coverage of 95 programmes and qualifications, including banking, asset management, insurance, and more, from local and international providers. Over 7,600 applications have been approved, totaling more than HK$42 million in reimbursements. We will extend this scheme to 2028 to sustain our efforts in talent development.

Finally, it is important for us to enhance investor education and understanding on green finance through better data, equipping stakeholders with analytical tools and insights for informed decision-making. The Steering Group has thus launched a data portal, containing Government data sources for assessing physical risks in Hong Kong, such as historical data on catastrophe damages and tropical cyclone impact data. We encourage the use of the tools and technology to enhance data availability and understanding of the impact of climate change in Hong Kong. We also hope it would in turn facilitate development of more targeted sustainable finance and technology solutions enabled by data insights.

Before I conclude, I would like to invite all of you to engage in Hong Kong Green Week, our flagship sustainability event. This platform fosters collaboration among global stakeholders, and your active participation is vital to shaping a sustainable future.

Hong Kong's four-pillar strategy including promoting market development, fostering innovation, enhancing transparency, and nurturing talent and enhancing data, positions us well to navigate the global challenges of climate change. By driving these initiatives, we are not only maintaining our leadership but also forging a collaborative, resilient and sustainable path forward. In this regard, I definitely look forward to continue our collaboration with HKGFA and Dr Ma (Chairman and President of HKGFA, Dr Ma Jun), and I urge you to join us in this global endeavor, turning visions into actions for a greener future.

Good afternoon, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a privilege to address you at the 2025 Hong Kong Green Finance Association Annual Forum, themed ""Navigating Climate Finance and Geopolitics: Strategies for Transition"".

As Asia's premier international financial centre, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to channel global capital toward a sustainable future. Amid geopolitical complexities, trade uncertainties, and the urgent need for climate actions, our city is poised to lead the green transition across Asia and beyond.

Let me reaffirm Hong Kong's role as Asia's leading green finance hub. Last year, our green and sustainable debt market, encompassing bonds and loans, surpassed US$84 billion. Green and sustainable bonds alone reached US$43 billion, capturing 45 per cent of the regional market and securing Hong Kong's position as Asia's top-ranked green bond market for seven consecutive years since 2018.

To sustain this leadership, we have adopted a four-pillar strategy in partnership with financial regulators and industry stakeholders, including (i) promoting market development, (ii) fostering financial innovation, (iii) enhancing sustainability transparency, and (iv) nurturing talent and enhancing data. Allow me to elaborate on each.

First pillar: promoting market development

Our Government Sustainable Bond Programme, expanded in May last year to cover sustainability on top of green projects, drives the development of sustainable initiatives by the Government and our green bond market. As of June this year, we have issued approximately HK$240 billion equivalent in green bonds, denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi, euros, and US dollars, with tenors ranging from one to 30 years. These issuances provide a critical benchmark for other issuers in Hong Kong and the region.

The programme supports projects across nine categories, including, for example, renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation, pollution prevention and control, waste management and resource recovery, and more. To date, it has funded 116 local green projects. Our annual Green Bond Report, with the 2025 edition due this month, details the allocation of proceeds and environmental benefits, reinforcing transparency and credibility.

Bond issuances aside, we have also been developing the carbon market. The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) operates Core Climate, an international carbon marketplace enabling transparent trading of carbon credits to support global net-zero transition. It is the only platform offering settlement in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi for international voluntary carbon credits. By the end of last year, Core Climate has attracted 100 participants. Carbon credits traded on the platform are sourced from certified projects for example in forestry, solar, wind, and biomass across Asia, South America, and Africa, aiding governments and businesses in furthering their efforts for low-carbon transition.

The HKEX has also signed Memoranda of Understanding with Mainland China's carbon markets, including the Beijing and Shenzhen Green Exchanges, to share expertise and foster regional collaboration.

Also, Hong Kong has advanced our green finance ecosystem beyond green bonds and the carbon market through the development of a local green classification framework. The Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, covering 12 key economic activities, was launched last year with a view to standardising green classification, reducing greenwashing risks, and enhancing information for decision making by investors. We are engaging the industry to expand the taxonomy, and will widen the scope of sectors and economic activities to include transition elements and additional sustainable activities, reinforcing our role as a leading sustainable and transition finance hub.

Second pillar: fostering financial innovation

Innovation is central to our green finance development strategy, and will inspire more ways to tackle the global problem of climate change. Hong Kong has pioneered the world's first government-issued tokenised green bond and the first multi-currency digital bond. These initiatives demonstrate our leadership in bond markets, green finance, and fintech. Tokenised bonds enable efficient settlement, broaden investor access, enhance interoperability, and improve transparency and efficiency. Continuing the success of our earlier issuance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is preparing our third tokenised bond issuance, advancing our plans for regularised offerings.

To integrate fintech with green finance, we are expanding our green fintech ecosystem, positioning Hong Kong as a regional green fintech hub. The Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group updated the Hong Kong Green Fintech Map this year, providing a comprehensive overview of green fintech companies and services and facilitating adoption and application.

Also, we launched the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme last year, offering early-stage funding to eligible technology companies and research institutes in Hong Kong. So far 60 projects have been approved, advancing commercialisation and adoption.

As for further innovation in carbon market, the HKMA's Project Ensemble explores tokenised deposits and Central Bank Digital Currency for interbank settlement, as well as tokenisation of real-world assets including carbon credits via blockchain. We are also exploring collaborations with central bank peers on enhancing transparency and efficiency in carbon credit trading through blockchain technology.

Third pillar: enhancing sustainability transparency

As sustainable development gains global prominence, ensuring accurate and consistent sustainability information is critical for investors and market participants. In December last year, we launched the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong, outlining a clear path for large publicly accountable entities to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Sustainability Disclosure Standards by 2028.

In June this year, the IFRS Foundation recognised Hong Kong as one of the first jurisdictions to commit to fully adopting ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) standards, underscoring our dedication to transparency in capital markets. This facilitates informed investment decisions and promotes global capital flows via our trusted market.

Also, our Stock Exchange has introduced enhanced climate-related disclosure requirements, based on the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, phasing in for listed companies from the beginning of this year.

As for the support to SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in sustainability reporting, our Steering Group is enhancing the Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for non-listed companies/SMEs. Launched in 2022, the Questionnaire is intended to provide a free and easy-to-use sustainability reporting template to corporates in need, facilitating their understanding of sustainability performance and raising their sustainability profiles to lenders, investors, and supply chain clients. Taking into account industry feedback and latest market developments, the Steering Group is enhancing the Questionnaire to make it more accessible and inclusive. The 2.0 version of the Questionnaire will soon be rolled out on the website of the Steering Group. Please watch out for that. Going forward, we will collaborate with the industry further to promote the usage of the Questionnaire.

Fourth pillar: nurturing talent and enhancing data

Building a skilled workforce is essential for advancing our green finance development. We launched the Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme for local market practitioners, professionals, students, and graduates. By July this year, the scheme has a coverage of 95 programmes and qualifications, including banking, asset management, insurance, and more, from local and international providers. Over 7,600 applications have been approved, totaling more than HK$42 million in reimbursements. We will extend this scheme to 2028 to sustain our efforts in talent development.

Finally, it is important for us to enhance investor education and understanding on green finance through better data, equipping stakeholders with analytical tools and insights for informed decision-making. The Steering Group has thus launched a data portal, containing Government data sources for assessing physical risks in Hong Kong, such as historical data on catastrophe damages and tropical cyclone impact data. We encourage the use of the tools and technology to enhance data availability and understanding of the impact of climate change in Hong Kong. We also hope it would in turn facilitate development of more targeted sustainable finance and technology solutions enabled by data insights.

Before I conclude, I would like to invite all of you to engage in Hong Kong Green Week, our flagship sustainability event. This platform fosters collaboration among global stakeholders, and your active participation is vital to shaping a sustainable future.

Hong Kong's four-pillar strategy including promoting market development, fostering innovation, enhancing transparency, and nurturing talent and enhancing data, positions us well to navigate the global challenges of climate change. By driving these initiatives, we are not only maintaining our leadership but also forging a collaborative, resilient and sustainable path forward. In this regard, I definitely look forward to continue our collaboration with HKGFA and Dr Ma (Chairman and President of HKGFA, Dr Ma Jun), and I urge you to join us in this global endeavor, turning visions into actions for a greener future. Thank you."

僱主應與僱員訂立熱帶氣旋或暴雨後合理的工作安排,2025-09-08 13:10,2025-09-08 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800503.htm,"勞工處今日（九月八日）提醒僱主應在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告信號取消後為僱員提供合理而切實可行的工作安排，並考慮路面、交通及其他情況，彈性處理僱員復工或遙距工作的安排（如適用）。這有助維持良好的勞資關係，並確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢。

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

  The Hospital Authority announces that its general out-patient clinics (GOPCs), specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs), allied health and other day services will be resumed gradually within two hours after the cancellation of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8.

  Chronic illness or SOPC patients, who have scheduled appointments at GOPCs, SOPCs, allied health or other day services, can follow the instructions listed on the appointment slips for the arrangements if their appointments are affected by the typhoon. Patients who booked their appointments via the telephone system or mobile app ""HA Go"" can make a new appointment one hour after the cancellation of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8."
Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-09-08 13:10,2025-09-08 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800500.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (September 8) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
