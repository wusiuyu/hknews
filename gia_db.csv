立法會十九題：提振本地消費,2025-07-30 12:20,2025-07-30 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000324.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上李鎮強議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，鑑於疫情過後市民的生活習慣和消費模式有所改變，政府應着力重振經濟，重新吸引消費人流，以刺激本地消費。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否考慮仿效內地的「購新補貼方案」，推出「港補」計劃，即個人消費者在購買手機、平板電腦等電子用品，以及電視、冷氣機等家電時，可獲一次性補貼，並就有關計劃設立特定使用條件（例如只限在本地實體店使用）；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）會否考慮支持戲院在周末晚上的電影場次推出戲票優惠，以吸引年輕消費者於晚間消費，從而帶動零售、餐飲以至交通服務等相關行業；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）有何具體措施重振本地夜經濟，以吸引市民留港消費？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直與社會各界攜手同心，全力拼經濟、謀發展，積極把握國家和國際機遇，推動經濟穩步向前。本地生產總值連續10個季度保持增長，二○二五年全年增長預測維持在2%至3%。政府會繼續密切留意經濟情況，因時制宜推行措施以協助業界，同時亦鼓勵零售業界積極尋索新路徑，推陳出新，為消費者創造新體驗，從而開拓更多商機和增長點。

政府統計處的數據顯示，二○二五年五月零售業總銷貨價值的臨時估計為313億元，較去年同月上升2.4%，終止了連續14個月的跌勢，顯示零售業在整體經濟復蘇帶動下，正開始回復到增長的正軌。政府正積極推動旅遊業及盛事項目，今年上半年訪港旅客人次約2400萬，按年增長12%，預計全年旅客人次會達4900萬，加上本地就業收入上升和內地經濟持續穩步增長，將有助進一步提振消費氣氛及支持消費市道。

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢財政司司長私人辦公室、文化體育及旅遊局、財經事務及庫務局和民政及青年事務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）在評估應否推行涉及大量公帑的一次性補貼措施時，政府秉持審慎理財原則，亦須進行全面考量，包括當前社會經濟形勢、政府的財政狀況，以及政策措施的長遠可持續性，以確保公共資源運用得宜，並切實保障香港整體利益。與此同時，政府將繼續多管齊下提振整體經濟，並聚焦透過長遠經濟政策及其他措施，包括加快創科產業轉型、促進資產市場穩健發展等，增強經濟增長動力，持續提升市民收入，從而提振市場消費。

（二）「全港戲院日」和「10.1半價睇好戲」的電影票價優惠活動獲得社會和電影業界的非常正面評價，在進一步刺激觀眾進入電影院觀賞電影之餘，亦帶動周邊消費。政府將繼續透過不同的資助項目及活動拓展本地觀眾群，培養市民到電影院觀賞電影的習慣，務求協助香港電影業、電影院業穩健發展。

（三）政府於二○二三年九月中展開「香港夜繽紛」活動，聯同社會各界舉辦一系列具香港特色和吸引力的夜間活動，向市民和遊客展示香港晚上的活力和魅力。社會各界對「香港夜繽紛」反應正面，各項活動為香港市面營造熱鬧氣氛。

其後民政事務總署轄下18區民政事務處聯同各區區議會成立的「提振地區經濟專責工作小組」於二○二四年一月推出一系列「18區日夜都繽紛」活動，目的主要是通過為市民提供各式文娛消閒節目，展現各區多元化的地區特色面貌或傳統文化風韻，以帶動市面熱鬧氣氛。活動受市民歡迎，而商戶反應正面，表示活動人流暢旺，對推廣生意有一定幫助。

此外，政府和香港旅遊發展局會繼續聯同會議及展覽業界和其他相關組織，推動不同規模及類型的國際會展旅遊活動在港舉行，吸引更多高增值過夜旅客訪港，從而推動零售市道。例如，香港零售管理協會於今年七月至八月舉辦第三屆「香港開心購物節」，透過跨界別合作，為市民及旅客提供消費折扣及免費禮品等優惠，以吸引更多新客群，為零售業注入新動能。

政府會繼續積極籌劃不同大型活動以吸引遊客到訪香港，同時推動本地市民及旅客在港消費，帶旺社會消費氛圍，從而帶動整體經濟。"
LCQ19: Boosting local consumption,2025-07-30 12:20,2025-07-30 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000332.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Lee Chun-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 Certain perspectives highlight that in view of the changes in people's lifestyle habits and consumption patterns after the epidemic, the Government should focus its efforts on reviving the economy and attracting consumer traffic again to stimulate local consumption. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will consider, by following the Mainland's ""Plan for Subsidies for the Purchase of New Products"", launching a ""Hong Kong Subsidy Plan"", i.e. individual consumers will be given a one-‍off subsidy for purchasing electronic products such as mobile phones and tablets, as well as household electrical appliances such as televisions and air-‍conditioners, and drawing up specific conditions of use under the plan (e.g. confining the use of such subsidies to local physical stores); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it will consider supporting cinemas to offer movie ticket promotion for film shows on weekend evenings, so as to attract night-‍time consumption by young consumers, thereby driving the development of the relevant industries such as retail, catering and even transport services; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the specific measures in place to revive the local night economy, so as to attract members of the public to stay and spend in Hong Kong?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been working closely with various sectors of the community to strive for economic growth and development, actively seizing national and international opportunities to drive the economy forward. The gross domestic product has grown for 10 consecutive quarters, and its growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is maintained at two per cent to three per cent. The Government will continue to closely monitor the economic situation, and implement measures to duly assist the business community, and at the same time, encourages the retail sector to actively explore new avenues, bring forth new and innovative ideas to create new experiences for consumers, with a view to developing more business opportunities and growth areas.

 The data of the Census and Statistics Department show that the value of total retail sales in May 2025 was $31.3 billion, representing an increase of 2.4 per cent as compared with the same period last year. This marks the end of a 14-month consecutive decline, showing that the retail sector is beginning to return to a growth trajectory alongside the recovery of the overall economy. The Government is actively promoting tourism and mega events. In the first half of this year, the number of visitor arrivals was about 24 million, representing a 12 per cent year-on-year increase. The number of visitor arrivals for the whole year is expected to reach 49 million, and together with the increase in employment earnings and sustained steady growth of the Mainland economy, it will help further bolster consumption sentiment and support the consumption market.

 Having consulted the Financial Secretary's Private Office, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) In assessing whether to implement one-off subsidy initiatives involving substantial public funds, the Government must adhere to the principle of prudent financial management and conduct a comprehensive evaluation. This includes considering the social and economic situation, the Government's fiscal situation, and the long-term sustainability of the policy measures to ensure the proper use of public resources and safeguard the overall interests of Hong Kong. At the same time, the Government will continue to take multi-pronged measures to stimulate the overall economy, with a focus on implementing long-term economic policies and other initiatives. These include transformation of the innovation and technology industry and promotion of the stable and healthy development of the assets market, etc., thereby strengthening economic growth momentum, enabling the sustained increase in incomes, and in turn boosting market consumption.

(2)Both the Cinema Day and the 1st October Movie Fiesta have received very positive feedbacks from the public and the film industry, as these initiatives of offering concessionary ticket prices provided additional incentive of watching films at cinemas and boosted consumption in surrounding shops. The Government will continue to fund projects and activities that build local audience, so as to cultivate the habit of cinema-going and support the steady development of Hong Kong films and cinema industries.

(3) The Government launched the ""Night Vibes Hong Kong"" campaign in mid-September 2023, where it joined hands with different sectors of the community to organise a wealth of attractive night-time events with local characteristics to showcase to the public and tourists the vibrancy and charm of nightlife in Hong Kong. The ""Night Vibes Hong Kong"" campaign was positively received by the community, with various activities of the campaign creating a dynamic vibe in Hong Kong.

 Subsequently, a series of activities of the ""Day x Night Vibes @ 18 Districts"" was launched in January 2024 by the 18 District Offices of the Home Affairs Department, in collaboration with the Working Group on Boosting Local Economy set up by the District Councils, with an aim to provide the public with a wide range of cultural and leisure events to showcase local diversity or traditional cultural connotations in various districts, so as to create a buoyant mood in the community. The activities have been well-received by the public, and the feedback received from stall operators has been predominantly positive, indicating high patronage and the activities' effectiveness in promoting their businesses.

 In addition, the Government and the Hong Kong Tourism Board, in collaboration with the convention and exhibition industry and relevant organisations, will continue to encourage the organisation of international meetings, travels, conventions and exhibitions events of different scales and types in Hong Kong, so as to help attract more high value-added overnight visitors to come to Hong Kong, thereby driving the retail market forward. For example, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association organises the third edition of the Hong Kong Shopping Festival from July to August this year to provide special offers such as shopping discounts and free gifts to the public and visitors through cross-sector co-operation, so as to attract more new clientele, with a view to injecting new momentum into the retail sector.

 The Government will continue to actively plan and organise various large-scale events to attract visitors to Hong Kong, and at the same time, promote local consumption by the local public and visitors, so as to bolster consumption sentiment in the community, thereby driving the overall economy."

答覆：

主席：

保安局一向積極鼓勵及支持轄下紀律部隊及輔助部隊應用不同創新科技以提升各類服務的效率及質素。其中，無人機應用技術日漸普及，已成為全球執法及應急管理領域的重要工具。各紀律部隊及輔助部隊亦採取不同策略，結合實際執勤需求進行形勢評估，在合適情況下應用無人機技術，以提升部隊的服務質素和工作效率。

就議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）各紀律部隊及輔助部隊已因應各類工作需要配備不同大小的無人機，以及相關的儀𠾖系統，以提升工作效率從而更有效調配人力資源。截止二○二五年六月三十日，各紀律部隊及輔助部隊採購無人機的數目及相關開支，以及執行任務的次數載列於附件。

至於工作範圍，無人機技術在部隊中的應用日趨廣泛，其中包括：

1. 在偵查罪案方面，香港警務處（警務處）、香港海關及入境事務處（入境處）在各項行動中運用無人機，配合高解像度鏡頭，於罪案現場進行錄影，尤其是野外和海上一些人手較難通達的地點，協助調查及搜證工作；

2. 在治安巡邏及預防罪案方面，警務處於今年五月份正式推行「小型無人機行動調配」先導計劃，在邊界警區和西九龍總區使用無人機執行巡邏任務。警務處在邊界警區採用自動化無人機庫系統，通過智慧規劃飛行路徑，實現自動巡防作業。無人機將按預設範圍執行巡邏任務提升邊境巡邏效率，及可更靈活調配警力；而在西九龍總區則透過靈活調配無人機執行高空巡邏任務，得以擴大巡邏範圍，提高效率並增強警方快速應變能力，優化資源運用。

先導計劃自五月份推出至今已協助警方拘捕三人並偵破四宗案件。警務處會檢視相關工作的進行情況及成效，並會研究將先導計劃進行優化並進一步擴大試行範圍至長洲分區和中環警區，預計於今年第四季推行；

3. 在維持公共安全秩序及人群交通管理方面，警務處於各項大型活動中運用無人機監控人群及交通流向，通過實時影像迅速辨識潛在的安全隱患；並引入可長時間懸停在指定位置的無人機系統，用於照明及廣播，向市民發送安全提示；

4. 在救援方面，警務處、消防處及民眾安全服務隊利用無人機快速抵達現場，克服懸崖、深山等險峻環境，協助搜索失蹤人士及監察救援過程，確保現場安全。此外，在大型及複雜的特別事故中，無人機可就倒塌及扭曲變形的瓦礫，拍攝高清影像並製作三維模型，協助地面工作人員進行評估及部署救援行動，如有需要更可透過投擲系統空投維生物資給受困者；

5. 在滅火方面，消防處利用配備熱成像鏡頭的無人機，在空中以多角度監察火場溫度變化，協助現場指揮人員制訂滅火策略、規劃進出路線，從而提升滅火救援行動效率及人員安全；以及

6. 在監獄及羈留設施管理方面，懲教署及入境處運用無人機技術協助巡查保安設施，包括檢測圍欄的耗損情況及建築物屋頂的異常物件，並協助人員在緊急情況下迅速應變，進一步加強設施保安。

在應用無人機技術的同時，各紀律部隊及輔助部隊會在執行任務的過程中實行嚴格控制和監管，確保無人機操作安全，並符合《個人資料（私隱）條例》，保障市民隱私。各紀律部隊及輔助部隊會嚴格遵守個人資料私隱專員公署發出的《閉路電視監察及使用航拍機指引》，包括制定內部守則規管部隊的飛行任務，妥善處理收集到的影像，並小心策劃飛行路線，以避免不必要地飛近公眾及民居。

（二）除了上述「小型無人機行動調配」先導計劃以外，警務處現時也有就特定行動使用無人機，包括在鄉郊地區運用小型無人機進行反爆竊巡邏工作，巡視有否可疑人士徘徊或匿藏。其間如偵測到其他違法行為，例如非法傾倒廢物活動，警務處會轉介相關部門跟進。

（三）目前警務處使用的無人機已具備不同功能，包括人工智能技術，並配備熱成像鏡頭及夜視鏡，協助在夜晚光線不足時為各類罪案偵查提供高效有力的技術支援。

隨着無人機技術日益成熟，無人機的功能亦變得多元化。各紀律部隊及輔助部隊會繼續密切留意創新科技發展，檢視目前各項科技的應用，包括無人機應用的成效，探討如何運用先進科技進一步提升部隊的服務質素和工作效率。"
LCQ2: Application of innovative technologies in law enforcement,2025-07-30 12:18,2025-07-30 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000346.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming and a reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 It is learnt that the application of innovative technologies is increasingly common in the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) of the Government, and various disciplined services are already equipped with different types of drones as well as mounted instrument systems to enhance work efficiency. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current number of drones procured by each LEA and the costs involved; the number of operations executed by such drones and their scope of work in the current year, and whether various LEAs have formulated mechanisms to protect personal privacy in respect of the application of drones;

(2) whether it will study enhancing the application of drones in law enforcement, as well as expanding their inspection coverage and regularising their patrol arrangements, so as to combat crimes such as fly-tipping activities and burglaries in rural areas; and

(3) as it has been reported that the use of automated drones has been introduced under the Pilot Scheme for Operational Deployment of Drones of the Police to carry out border patrol work, but there are views that under poor lighting conditions at night, it is difficult for the pilots and observers operating the drones to effectively identify suspicious persons, whether the Police have plans to make use of advanced apparatus or artificial intelligence technologies to enhance the capability of drones to identify suspicious persons, so as to further enhance patrol efficiency?

Reply:

President,

 The Security Bureau has been actively encouraging and supporting the application of various innovative technologies in its disciplined services and auxiliary services to enhance service efficiency and quality. In particular, drone technology is gaining popularity and has become a major tool used worldwide in the areas of law enforcement and emergency response. The disciplined services and auxiliary services are using drone technology as appropriate through adopting different strategies and assessing the situation according to actual operational needs, in order to enhance service quality and operational efficiency.

 The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) The disciplined services and auxiliary services are, having regard to various operational needs, equipped with drones of different sizes and related instrument systems to enhance operational efficiency, thereby better utilising manpower resources. The number of drones purchased, the relevant expenditure and the number of tasks performed by drones in respective disciplined services and auxiliary services as of June 30, 2025 are set out in the Annex.

 As regards the scope of tasks, the use of drone technology is increasingly common in the disciplined services/auxiliary services. Examples include:

1. Crime detection and investigation: Drones are used in operations conducted by the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department and the Immigration Department (ImmD). Equipped with high-resolution cameras for video recording at crime scenes, especially in the countryside and at the sea where access by persons are relatively difficult, the drones are capable of assisting in investigation and evidence collection;

2. Beat patrolling and crime prevention: The HKPF officially launched the Pilot Scheme for ""Operational Deployment of Drones"" in May this year. Drones are used to perform patrols in the Border District and Kowloon West Region. In the Border District, the HKPF deployed an automated drone docking system which utilises smart planning of flight paths to enable automatic patrol operations. With drones conducting patrols within pre-defined zones, efficiency of border patrol is enhanced and police deployment has become more flexible. As for Kowloon West Region, through flexible deployment of drones for high-altitude patrols, the patrol coverage is expanded and operational efficiency is enhanced. It also boosts rapid response capabilities and optimises resource allocation of the Police;

 Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme in May, the use of drones has assisted the Police in detecting four cases so far, with three persons arrested. The HKPF will review the implementation progress of the Pilot Scheme as well as its effectiveness. In parallel, the HKPF will study the enhancement of the Pilot Scheme and will further expand its coverage to Cheung Chau Division and the Central District, which is scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year;

3. Maintaining of public safety and public order; management of crowds and traffic: Drones are used by the HKPF to monitor crowd and traffic flow in largeâscale events. Through real-time images, potential safety hazards are promptly identified. The HKPF introduced a drone system capable of hovering at designated locations for an extended period of time for illumination and broadcasting, sending safety reminders to members of the public;

4. Rescue operations: The HKPF, the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the Civil Aid Service use drones to surmount harsh conditions and quickly reach scenes like cliffs and mountains to assist in the search for missing persons. Throughout the rescue process, drones can conduct surveillance to ensure safety at the site. In addition, in major and special incidents where the scenes are complicated, drones can take high-definition photographs of collapsed and deformed debris for the production of three-dimensional models, thereby facilitating the assessment and planning of rescue operations by ground rescue personnel. If necessary, the airdrop system installed at the drones can be used to drop necessities to stranded persons;

5. Firefighting: The FSD uses drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras to monitor temperature changes at the fire scene from multiple angles in the air. Based on such data, incident commanders can work out firefighting strategies and devise entry and evacuation routes to enhance the efficiency of firefighting and rescue operations and ensure the safety of rescue workers; and

6. Management of prisons and detention facilities: To further strengthen the security of these facilities, drone technology is employed by the Correctional Services Department and the ImmD to assist in the inspection of security facilities, for example, examining the deteriorating conditions of boundary fencing and checking roof-tops of buildings for anomalous objects, as well as assisting in taking swift emergency response actions.

 While applying drone technology, the disciplined services and auxiliary services will exercise stringent control and supervision in the course of performing their duties to ensure that the operation of the drones is safe and complies with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, so as to protect the privacy of the public. The disciplined services and auxiliary services will strictly comply with the Guidance on CCTV Surveillance and Use of Drones issued by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data. For example, internal guidelines are formulated to regulate flight missions of the disciplined services and auxiliary services, video footage collected are handled properly, and flight paths are carefully planned to avoid unnecessary proximity to the public and residential areas.

(2) In addition to the Pilot Scheme for ""Operational Deployment of Drones"" mentioned above, the HKPF is currently using drones in other specific operations, including anti-burglary patrols in rural areas to see if there are suspicious persons lingering or hiding. Other illegal activities, such as fly-tipping, that are detected during the patrols will be referred to relevant departments for follow-up actions.

(3) The drones being used by the HKPF is equipped with various functions, including artificial intelligence technology. They are also fitted with thermal imaging cameras and night vision cameras to provide efficient and effective technological support for the detection of different types of crime during night time when lighting is inadequate.

 As drone technology matures, drones have become more versatile in terms of their functions. The disciplined services and auxiliary services will consistently observe innovative technology development while reviewing the application of various technologies, including the effectiveness of the use of drones. Meanwhile, the disciplined services and auxiliary services will examine ways to further enhance their service quality and operational efficiency through the use of advanced technologies."
LCQ1: Labour Importation Scheme for Transport Sector,2025-07-30 12:11,2025-07-30 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000325.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lam So-wai and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

The Government launched two rounds of the Labour Importation Scheme for the Transport Sector - Public Light Bus (PLB)/Coach Trade (the Scheme) in 2023 and last year respectively, to allow PLB and coach trades to suitably import drivers. However, there are views pointing out that imported drivers may affect road safety due to their differences in driving culture, habits, and language. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of workers to date who have come to Hong Kong through the second round of applications under the Scheme and those who have commenced their driving work after obtaining the relevant driving licence and completing the route training; whether it has compiled statistics on the driving test passing rate and retest rate of imported drivers under the Scheme, and the traffic accident rate after commencing their driving work, with a breakdown by the type of vehicle they operate (i.e. PLB, coach, and cross-boundary bus);

(2) how it will ensure that imported drivers under the Scheme are adequately trained to avoid a high proportion of imported drivers failing the driving tests and requiring retakes, as well as the occurrence of a high traffic accident rate; and

(3) given that some members of the cross-boundary bus industry have pointed out that there is still a shortage of drivers at present, whether consideration will be given to increasing the quotas or launching the third round of applications under the Scheme?

Reply:

President,

The Government has all along been concerned about the persistent shortage of drivers in the public light bus (PLB) and coach trades. In June 2023, the Government announced the Labour Importation Scheme for the Transport Sector – PLB/Coach Trade (the Scheme), which can reasonably address the manpower shortage problem in the relevant trades, while safeguarding the employment opportunities of the local workforce.

Our reply to the question raised by the Hon Lam So-wai is as follows:

(1) and (2) The total number of quotas for imported drivers under the Scheme is 1 700. All quotas have been allocated through two rounds of applications in September 2023 and July 2024 respectively. Among the 849 quotas approved in the second round of applications, as of the end of last month (i.e. June 2025), a total of 716 imported drivers, including 422 PLB drivers, 167 local coach drivers and 127 cross-boundary coach (CBC) drivers, have been arranged by their employers to complete the relevant training and assessment, including obtaining the relevant driving licenses, and have commenced services after completing the route training.

We attach great importance to the driving skills and performance of imported drivers. Upon approval of the quota for imported drivers, employers are required to arrange the drivers to come to Hong Kong in a timely manner to undergo training for the relevant driving tests. Under the existing mechanism, imported drivers are required to pass and comply with the same driving test arrangements and standards as those for local drivers to ensure road safety. As of the end of last month, the passing rates of local driving tests for imported PLB drivers, local coach drivers and CBC drivers have remained stable at 43 per cent, 43 per cent and 55 per cent respectively. In comparison, these figures are better than the passing rates of local drivers for PLB and public bus driving tests in 2024, which are 15 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. In addition, as of the end of last month, the percentages of imported PLB drivers, local coach drivers and CBC drivers who had to retake the driving test to pass are 63 per cent, 54 per cent and 42 per cent respectively.

After passing the driving tests, imported drivers are required by law to attend the PLB or public bus pre-service course. The courses aim to enhance the awareness of new drivers on driving safety and driving attitude, and equip them with basic knowledge of passenger service and skills in customer service, etc. Imported drivers must complete the pre-service course and pass the course examination. The Transport Department (TD) will then issue the full driving licence to the imported drivers. Before commencement of driving services, the employers will also arrange route training for the imported drivers, so to enable the drivers to familiarise themselves with the driving and passenger pick-up arrangement of the assigned route.

Since the introduction of the Scheme, the TD has been actively following up and co-ordinating with the operators, including enhancing the driving test arrangements and reminding them of the need to arrange adequate driving test training for the imported drivers. As the Scheme progresses, employers have gained a thorough understanding of the procedures and processes of importing drivers, as well as the arrangements of the driving tests. They are generally able to arrange for imported drivers to complete the test and training as early as practicable, so as to provide safe services to the public.

Same as local PLB/coach drivers, operators are required to closely monitor the daily performance of imported drivers. The TD will also monitor the services provided by the operators on a regular basis and conduct on-site inspections to understand the performance of drivers (including imported drivers) as necessary. According to our observation and feedback from employers, imported drivers are generally experienced drivers with adequate traffic knowledge. They are able to handle the road conditions in Hong Kong, delivering steady and high-quality services. At present, the TD requires the operators to submit investigation reports on accidents involving PLB and coach, and will take appropriate follow-up actions against the operators based on the investigation outcome. According to the number of traffic accidents reported by operators to the Police, during the 16-month period from January last year to end April this year, there were a total of 1 115 traffic accidents involving PLBs and 554 traffic accidents involving coaches. Among these, 111 involved imported PLB drivers and 18 involved imported coach drivers, which account for less than 10 per cent and about 3 per cent of the total traffic accidents respectively.

(3) Overall, the implementation of the Scheme has been generally smooth. The imported drivers can effectively alleviate the acute manpower shortage in the trades, enhance service standards and provide quality and stable services to the public. In our observation, some green minibus routes have shown a significant improvement in service frequencies and reduction in the number of complaints after introducing imported drivers.

With the aging of drivers in the PLB and coach trade, the quotas for imported labour under the Scheme can only meet about half of the manpower gap, and cannot fully resolve the long-term labour shortage problem faced by the trades. At the same time, with the recovery of the number of visitors and more frequent exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland, we notice that there is a growing demand from citizens and visitors for public transportation, particularly for local coach and CBC services, which poses challenges for the manpower situation of the trade. The Government will continue to closely monitor changes in the local labour market and the manpower situation, and will continue to review the implementation of the Scheme and assess the manpower needs of the trades. At the same time, we will maintain close communication with various stakeholders and enhance information dissemination through the stakeholder consultative group, and review the Scheme in good time.

Thank you, President."

問題：

政府分別於二○二三年及去年推出兩輪運輸業輸入勞工計劃──公共小巴／客車行業（該計劃），適度容許公共小巴及客車行業輸入司機。然而有意見指出，外勞司機在駕駛文化、習慣和言語上的差異或會影響行車安全。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）至今分別有多少名勞工透過該計劃的第二輪申請抵港，以及在取得相關駕駛執照及完成路線培訓後投入駕駛工作；有否統計，該計劃的外勞司機的駕駛考試及格率及重考率，以及投入駕駛工作後的交通意外比率，並按其所駕駛的車輛類型（即公共小巴、客車及跨境直通巴士）列出分項數字；

（二）如何確保該計劃的外勞司機獲得充足培訓，以避免大比例外勞司機駕駛考試不及格而須重考，以及出現交通意外率偏高的情況；及

（三）鑑於有跨境巴士業界人士指出，現時司機人手仍然短缺，當局會否考慮增加該計劃配額及推出第三輪申請？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直關注公共小巴及客車行業持續面對的司機短缺問題，並於二○二三年六月公布運輸業輸入勞工計劃──公共小巴／客車行業（計劃），既可合理應對有關行業的人手短缺問題，也同時保障本地勞動人口的就業機會。

就林素蔚議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）在計劃下可輸入司機的配額總數為1 700個，政府分別在二○二三年九月及二○二四年七月透過兩輪申請，悉數批出所有配額。在第二輪申請獲批的849個配額中，截至上月即二○二五年六月底，共有716名輸入司機已獲僱主安排完成相關培訓和考核，包括考取相關駕駛執照，並在完成相關路線的訓練後投入服務，當中包括422名公共小巴司機、167名本地客車司機和127名跨境巴士司機。

我們十分重視輸入司機的駕駛技能及工作表現。在獲批輸入司機配額後，僱主須適時安排司機來港，進行相關車輛的駕駛考試訓練。按現時機制，輸入司機須通過及遵從與本地司機相同的相關駕駛考試安排及標準，以保障道路安全。截至上月底，輸入公共小巴司機、本地客車司機及跨境巴士司機的本地駕駛考試及格率保持平穩，分別為43%、43%和55%，優於本地司機在二○二四年公共小巴和公共巴士的考試及格率，即分別為15%和30%。另外，截至上月底，輸入的公共小巴司機、本地客車司機及跨境巴士司機須重考才通過駕駛考試的比率分別為63%、54%和42%。

通過駕駛考試後，輸入司機必須按法例要求，修習公共小巴或公共巴士職前課程。課程旨在提高新入職司機的駕駛安全和態度，及讓他們掌握載客服務的基本知識和顧客服務技巧等。輸入司機必須完成職前課程並通過課程考試，運輸署才會向司機發出正式駕駛執照。僱主亦會在輸入司機投入服務前提供路線培訓，好讓他們熟習指定路線服務的行車及接載乘客的相關運作安排。

運輸署在計劃推出後，一直積極跟進和協調，包括優化駕駛考試安排及提醒營辦商需要為輸入司機安排足夠駕駛考試訓練。隨着計劃推展，僱主對輸入司機的手續、程序和駕駛考試的安排現已有充分掌握，大致能夠安排輸入司機早日完成考試和培訓，為市民提供安全的服務。

與本地公共小巴／客車司機一樣，營辦商須密切監督輸入司機的日常工作表現。運輸署亦會恆常地監察營辦商的服務，並會按需要實地視察了解司機（包括輸入司機）的表現。據我們觀察和僱主的回饋，輸入司機普遍駕駛經驗豐富，擁有充足交通知識，能夠應對本港的路面情況，提供穩健及高水平的服務。現時，運輸署有要求營辦商就涉及公共小巴或客車的交通意外提交調查報告，並會按調查結果向營辦商採取合適的跟進行動。根據營辦商向警方報案的交通意外數字，在去年一月至今年四月底的16個月內，分別共有1 115宗涉及小巴及554宗涉及客車的交通意外，當中111宗涉及輸入小巴司機及18宗涉及輸入客車司機，分別佔比低於10%和約3%。

（三）整體而言，計劃的實施過程大致暢順，輸入司機能有效紓緩行業人手嚴重短缺的問題，有助業界提升服務水平，為市民提供優質及穩定的服務。我們觀察到部分專線小巴路線在引入輸入司機後，其服務班次有明顯改善，而投訴數字亦有所減少。

基於公共小巴及客車行業司機日益高齡化，計劃下的輸入勞工的配額只能應付行業約一半的人力資源缺口，未能完全解決業界面對長期人手不足的問題。與此同時，隨着旅客數字回穩，以及香港和內地的聯繫愈趨緊密，我們留意到市民和旅客對公共交通，特別是本地客車和跨境巴士服務的需求也有所上升，對業界人手情況持續構成挑戰。政府會繼續密切留意本地勞工市場及人力情況的變化，並持續檢視計劃的實施情況及評估行業的人手需求，同時亦會透過諮詢小組與各持份者保持緊密溝通及加強發放資訊，適時檢討計劃。

多謝主席。"
​立法會十三題：提升交通安全,2025-07-30 12:02,2025-07-30 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000191.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上何敬康議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

根據警方的《交通報告二零二四年》，近年交通意外宗數持續上升，由二○二二年的15 107宗上升至去年的18 354宗，升幅達21.5%。同時，被運輸署定義為交通黑點（交通黑點）的路段由二○二二年第一季的29個，增加至去年第四季的57個。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年發生在交通黑點的交通意外總宗數，以及佔該年整體交通意外總宗數的比率分別為何；

（二）當局有否就全港各個交通黑點進行研究或實地評估，以分析其形成的成因（例如是否與該等路段的道路設計、交通流量或行人活動有關）；如有，研究結果和改善道路設施的計劃分別為何；長遠而言，當局有否計劃全面檢討全港道路的設計，或引入智能交通系統（如利用人工智能監測車速及實時調節交通燈號）以加強監察，從而進一步減少交通黑點數目；

（三）過去五年，每年有多少個正在進行或已經完工的交通黑點改善工程項目（包括但不限於指示牌及改善交通設施等）；有否評估有關項目的執行成效（包括在改善工程完成後，在該等路段發生的交通意外數字及所涉傷亡人數）為何；

（四）鑑於運輸署會在交通黑點設置「前面有交通意外黑點」標誌，讓道路使用者（包括駕駛者及行人）更易辨識交通黑點的位置，而據報運輸署過往亦曾在多次發生嚴重交通意外的路段（例如跑馬地摩利臣山道和體育路交界的路口）加設告示牌和減速地面標示，但其交通事故頻生的問題仍未解決，就已採取交通改善措施但交通事故仍頻生的路段，當局未來有何措施和計劃，包括會否與警方協調並加強執法，以盡量減低該等道路發生交通意外的風險；及

（五）有否參考其他國家和地區的做法或研究其他可行措施，以進一步加強道路使用者在途經交通黑點時的警覺性和危機意識？

答覆：

主席：

就何敬康議員有關在交通黑點發生的交通意外及道路安全改善措施的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二四年於交通黑點發生的交通意外宗數，及其佔該年度整體交通意外宗數的比率表列如下。二○二○年至二○二二年的數字或受新冠疫情因素影響，而二○二三年至二○二四年交通意外宗數有所上升，主要是由於輕微交通意外宗數增加。

（二）及（四）政府多管齊下加強道路安全，致力從源頭減少交通意外發生，包括調查和分析在交通黑點發生的交通意外成因並制定針對性的改善措施，檢視法例加強對駕駛安全的要求和罰則的阻嚇力、改善道路設計和交通管理措施、應用科技以提升交通管理，以及加強宣傳教育和執法。

整體而言，大多數交通意外涉及駕駛者因素，例如不專注地駕駛、行車時太貼近前面的車輛及不小心轉換行車線。就此，運輸署會繼續聯同香港警務處與道路安全議會透過宣傳教育及加強執法提升駕駛者的道路安全意識。而運輸署亦一直聚焦分析交通黑點和其他交通意外比較頻繁的地點的意外數據，詳細研究是否有明顯的意外模式以至意外的共同成因，並制定針對性的改善措施。

此外，政府亦按研究所得、科技發展和其他地區的經驗，檢視法例。我們去年向立法會提交多項提升道路安全的法例修訂，包括規定電動車安裝車輛聲響警報系統、規定有可延伸架空結構的車輛安裝過高警示系統，以及規定私家車的兒童乘客使用兒童束縛設備，這些措施有助加強保障道路使用者的安全。此外，我們最近向立法會建議上調《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》與道路安全和交通擠塞有關的其中十九項罪行（包括超速駕駛、沒有遵從交通標誌和道路標記、橫過連續雙白線、駕駛時使用流動電話等）的定額罰款，以加強罰則的阻嚇作用。

運輸署也針對特定情況作出道路改善和交通管理優化措施，例如調整交通燈號、加建中央分隔欄、改善行人過路設施、優化交通標誌及道路標記等。就提問中指出的跑馬地摩理臣山道和體育道路口，運輸署在過去數年實施多項交通改善措施，當中包括增設「15米前停車」及「小心右面車輛」的交通標誌、增設「慢駛」及影線道路標記，把行車道局部收窄，以及增設黃色減速道路標記，以進一步提醒駕駛人士減速。此外，運輸署已在本年六月底重新整理路口前的交通標誌，並增設紅底白字「停車及讓路」的警告標誌，以更明確提示駕駛人士在路口前必須停車及讓路。運輸署現已安排以臨時水馬適度收窄前往皇后大道東及香港仔隧道之行車道，以期減低車輛在路口前的行駛速度，並會繼續檢視路口的交通情況，及考慮其他可行的交通改善措施及評估交通影響。

就斑馬線過路處方面，運輸署正更換全港有關的傳統黃波燈，使斑馬線過路處更顯眼及安全，同時配合宣傳、教育和執法活動，提醒駕駛者須停車讓行人先行。此外，實時交通燈號調節系統有助改善行人過路環境及道路安全。運輸署正逐步把系統推展至全港約50個合適的獨立燈控路口，將在二○二六年開始陸續裝設；另外，運輸署已完成在東涌市中心八個聯動式燈號控制路口實時交通燈號調節系統的試驗，並正安排在其他交通流量較高的聯動式路口試點安裝和收集狀況不同的路口的數據，以便制定長遠計劃。運輸署和香港警務處也會繼續善用新科技完善交通管理，提升道路安全。

（三）二○二○年至二○二四年期間，運輸署為約70個交通黑點和其他交通意外比較頻繁的地點實施道路設施改善工程，現時其中超過50個地點的改善工程已經完成，當中30個地點於改善工程完成後一年的整體交通意外宗數及傷亡人數，較工程完成前一年分別下降約24%及30%，而其餘20多個地點的改善工程完工未足一年，運輸署正收集更多數據以作分析。

（五）與其他國家和地區的做法相似，運輸署會因應個別交通黑點和其他交通意外比較集中的地點的具體情況，實施有助提高駕駛者警覺性的措施，包括設置合適的交通標誌及／或道路標記，例如「前面有行人過路處」、「交通燈號在前」、「開始減速」、「道路急轉」、「前面有向下斜坡」、「慢駛」等，讓駕駛者具體地掌握前方道路的環境，提前準備應對，減低意外發生的風險。而如上文所述，在整體層面，我們也會優化全港性的道路設施，善用新科技，並適時檢視法例，以締造更安全的道路環境，減少意外。"
LCQ13: Enhancing traffic safety,2025-07-30 12:02,2025-07-30 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000192.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Adrian Hoand a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

According to the Police's Traffic Report 2024, the number of traffic accidents has been on the increase in recent years, from 15 107 in 2022 to 18 354 last year, with a rate of increase as high as 21.5 per cent. At the same time, the number of road sections defined by the Transport Department (TD) as traffic black spots had increased from 29 in the first quarter of 2022 to 57 in the fourth quarter of last year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the total number of traffic accidents which occurred at the traffic black spots in each of the past five years, and its respective percentage in the total number of traffic accidents in that year;

(2) whether the authorities have conducted studies or on-site assessments on various traffic black spots across the territory to analyse the cause of their formation (e.g. whether it is related to the road design, traffic flow capacity or pedestrian activities at such road sections); if so, of the respective findings of the studies and plans to improve the road facilities; whether the authorities have plans to conduct a comprehensive review of the design of roads across the territory, or introduce a smart traffic system (such as using artificial intelligence to monitor vehicle speed and making real-time adaptation to traffic signals) so as to enhance monitoring, thereby further reducing the number of traffic black spots in the long run;

(3) of the number of road improvement projects for traffic black spots in progress or completed (including but not limited to signages and improvement of transport facilities, etc) in each of the past five years; whether it has assessed the effectiveness of the implementation of the projects concerned (including the numbers of traffic accidents which occurred at such road sections and the resultant casualties upon completion of the improvement works);

(4) given that the TD will install the ""Traffic accident blackspot ahead"" signs at traffic black spots to enable road users (including motorists and pedestrians) to identify the locations of traffic black spots more easily, and it has been reported that the TD had in the past put up notices and provided road markings of speed reduction at road sections at which serious traffic accidents had repeatedly occurred (e.g. the junction of Morrison Hill Road and Sports Road in Happy Valley), but the problem of frequent traffic accidents has not yet been resolved; with respect to road sections where traffic accidents still occurred frequently despite the taking of traffic improvement measures, of the measures and plans to be implemented by the authorities in the future, including whether it will co-ordinate with the Police and step up law enforcement, so as to minimise the risk of traffic accidents occurring on such roads; and

(5) whether it has drawn on the practices of other countries and regions or explored other feasible measures to further enhance the alertness and crisis awareness of road users when passing through traffic black spots?

Reply:

President,

After consulting the Transport Department (TD), my response to the questions raised by the Hon Adrian Ho regarding traffic accidents and measures to improve road safety at traffic accident black spots is as follows:

(1) The number of traffic accidents that occurred at black spots between 2020 and 2024, along with their proportion of the total annual traffic accidents, is shown in the table below. The figures for 2020 to 2022 may have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise in traffic accidents in 2023 and 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of minor accidents.




Year
Numbers of traffic accidents occurred at black spots
Proportion to the total number of traffic accidents in that year


2020
448
2.9%


2021
355
2.0%


2022
479
3.2%


2023
729
4.2%


2024
649
3.5%




(2) and (4) The Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to enhance road safety and reduce traffic accidents at the source. Key initiatives include investigating and analysing the causes of traffic accidents at black spots, formulating targeted improvement measures, reviewing legislation to strengthen driving safety requirements and increase the deterrent effect of penalties, improving road design and traffic management, incorporating technology to enhance traffic oversight, and stepping up publicity, education, and law enforcement.

In general, most traffic accidents are attributed to driver-related factors such as inattentive driving, tailgating, and careless lane changes. To address these issues, the TD will continue to collaborate with the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Road Safety Council to raise drivers' awareness through education campaigns and stricter enforcement. The TD is also focused on analysing accident data from black spots and other high-risk locations to identify common patterns and causes, enabling the formulation of targeted improvement measures.

In addition, the Government has reviewed existing legislation in light of research findings, technological advancements, and practices from other regions. In 2024, several legislative amendments were submitted to the Legislative Council to strengthen road safety, including requirements for electric vehicles to be equipped with an acoustic vehicle alerting system, for vehicles with extendable aerial structures to have an over-height warning system, and for child passengers in private cars to use child restraining devices. These measures further protect road users. Furthermore, the Government has proposed to increase fixed penalties for 19 traffic offences under the Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance, such as speeding, failure to comply with traffic signs and markings, crossing double white lines, and using mobile phones while driving, to enhance their deterrent effect.

The TD has also implemented traffic management and road improvement measures tailored to specific situations. These include adjusting traffic signals, adding central dividers, improving pedestrian facilities, and optimising signage and road markings. At the junction of Morrison Hill Road and Sports Road in Happy Valley, mentioned in the enquiry, the TD has introduced several traffic improvements over recent years. These include new signs reading ""Stop 15 metres ahead"" and ""Beware of vehicles from the right,"" lane-narrowing hatched markings and ""Slow down"" indicators, and yellow speed-reduction road markings. In late June 2025, the TD rearranged signs at the junction and added a ""Stop and give way"" warning sign with white letters on a red background to clearly signal the need to yield. Temporary water-filled barriers were also placed along lanes leading to Queen's Road East and Aberdeen Tunnel to encourage speed reduction. The TD will continue to monitor the junction's conditions, evaluate traffic impact, and consider further feasible improvements.

Regarding zebra crossings, the TD is replacing traditional Belisha beacons across Hong Kong to make crossings more visible and safer. These efforts are complemented by education and enforcement activities reminding drivers to stop for pedestrians. Additionally, the Real-time Adaptive Traffic Signal System is improving the pedestrian environment and road safety. The system is being expanded to approximately 50 independent signalised junctions starting in 2026. After a successful trial across eight linked signalised junctions in Tung Chung Town Centre, pilot installations will continue at other busy junctions. Data collected will help inform long-term strategies. The TD and the HKPF will also continue to leverage new technologies to improve traffic management and enhance road safety.

(3) Between 2020 and 2024, the TD carried out road improvement works at approximately 70 traffic accident black spots and other locations with a relatively high frequency of accidents. As of now, improvement works have been completed at over 50 of these sites. Among them, 30 locations recorded a reduction in overall traffic accidents and casualties by approximately 24 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, within one year following the completion of the works, compared to the year prior. For the remaining 20-plus locations, improvement works were completed less than a year ago, and the TD is currently gathering further data for analysis.

(5) In line with practices adopted by other countries and regions, the TD will implement measures to enhance driver awareness based on the specific conditions of individual traffic accident black spots and other areas with a higher concentration of accidents. These measures include installing appropriate traffic signs and road markings, such as ""Pedestrian crossing ahead"", ""Traffic signals ahead"", ""Reduce speed now"", ""Sharp deviation"", ""Steep hill downwards ahead"", and ""Slow down"", to provide drivers with a clearer understanding of the road conditions ahead and help them prepare accordingly to reduce accident risks. As mentioned above, we will continue to upgrade road infrastructure throughout Hong Kong, leverage new technologies, and conduct timely legislative reviews from a comprehensive standpoint to foster a safer road environment and reduce traffic accidents."

Question:

It has been reported that the Registration of Persons - Hong Kong Office (Hong Kong Office) of the Immigration Department (ImmD), which is located on the 8th floor of the Immigration Tower in Wan Chai, is expected to relocate within 2026. Regarding the arrangements for registration of persons (ROP) services, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the usage figures and expenditures of each ROP office in the past three years;

(2) of the relocation details (including the timetable) of the Hong Kong Office;

(3) of the criteria adopted by the Government for determining the new location of the Hong Kong Office, e.g. whether it will consider facilitating members of the public to renew their Mainland Travel Permits for Hong Kong and Macao Residents concurrently, or relocating the office to the area of Wan Chai District or the Central and Western District in the vicinity of the original location; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) given that apart from the Hong Kong Office, the ImmD currently also operates the Hong Kong Island Travel Documents Issuing Office in the Harbour Building in Central, as well as the Births and Deaths General Register Office and the Marriage Registration and Records Office in the Queensway Government Offices respectively, and as the Queensway Government Offices have been reserved for the expansion of the High Court, whether the authorities have plans to consolidate the offices in the aforesaid three locations into one integrated office, so as to optimise the use of resources and achieve synergy; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) in order to facilitate members of the public to use self-service kiosks to apply for or collect documents outside office hours, whether the Hong Kong Office will set up Personal Documentation Submission Kiosks after its relocation, so as to provide automated services for the applications for identity cards and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, a reply to the questions raised by the Hon Chan Hak-kan is as follows:

(1) The usage statistics of each Registration of Persons (ROP) Office under the Immigration Department (ImmD) from 2023 to June 30, 2025 are tabulated below:

@The usage statistics reflect the number of applications, document collections and enquiries at each office (rounded to the nearest thousand). In 2023, usage was significantly higher due to factors including resumption of normal travel between Hong Kong and the Mainland.
^The extended service hours of the four ROP Offices began on March 6, 2023 and ended on December 31, 2024.
*The ROP - Kwun Tong Office was relocated to the new headquarters in Tseung Kwan O on June 11, 2024, and renamed as the ROP - Tseung Kwan O Office.
#The ROP - Kwun Tong (Temporary) Office commenced operations on November 1, 2023.

As operating ROP Offices is part of the regular duties of the ImmD, the ImmD does not maintain a separate breakdown of the operation expenses for each ROP Office. The salaries expenses related to ROP Offices in the past three financial years are tabulated below:




Year
Salaries expenses ($100 million) (Note)


2023-24
2.04


2024-25
2.16


2025-26 (April - June)
0.37




Note: Including salaries expenses of civil servants and contract staff. Apart from operating the six regular ROP Offices, given the surge in the demand for Hong Kong identity cards-related services after the pandemic, the ImmD extended operating hours of four ROP Offices from March 6, 2023 to December 31, 2024, and established the ROP - Kwun Tong (Temporary) Office on November 1, 2023 through internal redeployment of manpower, with a view to enhancing the overall handling capacity of ROP Offices. The ImmD coped with the demand for Hong Kong identity cards-related services through flexible manpower deployment and does not maintain a breakdown of salaries expenses for each ROP Office.

(2) To provide more convention and exhibition (C&E) facilities for fostering the long-term development of the Hong Kong C&E industry, the Government is taking forward the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project near the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre as planned, including the redevelopment of the sites of the Wan Chai Government Offices Compound, Gloucester Road Garden and the Kong Wan Fire Station into C&E facilities, hotel and office.

The Immigration Headquarters was relocated from the Immigration Tower in Wan Chai to Tseung Kwan O in June 2024. The ROP Office - Hong Kong Office (ROP HK Office), situated at the Immigration Tower in Wan Chai, continues to provide services to the public at its current site. To pave the way for the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project, the ImmD is currently identifying suitable office space in the area for the relocation of the ROP HK Office. The relocation timing and location would depend on the actual circumstances, including the progress of the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project, operational needs and service demand of the ROP HK Office. The ImmD will make suitable announcement once the details of the relocation plan for the ROP HK Office have been finalised.

(3) and (4) When relocating the ROP HK Office, the ImmD will consider factors such as transport accessibility, public service demands, and operational needs, etc, and ensure that the location chosen will be convenient for citizens. The ImmD will also continuously review the service arrangements and operations of its offices, and explore the feasibility of integrating offices and facilities of the ImmD currently scattered across different locations, with a view to providing more convenient and quality services to the public.

(5) To promote the development of a Smart Government, the ImmD has been leveraging technology to enhance service efficiency, including the provision of self-service options in application and collection for specific personal documentation services through various self-service kiosks set up at various offices.

In December last year, the ImmD enhanced the functions of the Personal Documentation Submission Kiosks (PDSKs) and introduced self-application services for Hong Kong identity cards (HKICs). Eligible applicants can complete the HKIC application procedures in a self-service manner and can apply for HKICs and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports in one-go through the PDSKs. The application procedures, including identity verification, photo taking, data filling and electronic payment, can be completed at the PDSKs in a self-service manner without the need to make an appointment. For collection, the Personal Documentation Collection Kiosks (PDCKs) have integrated various functions of the existing collection kiosks. Eligible applicants can collect personal documents in one-go in a self-service manner.

Currently, a total of 54 new self-service kiosks, including 44 PDSKs and 10 PDCKs, have been set up at the Immigration Headquarters situated at Tseung Kwan O. The new self-service kiosks have been operating smoothly since its launch and well received by the public.

註︰包括公務員及合約員工的薪金開支。除營運六間常設人事登記處外，因市民對身份證及其他身份證服務需求在疫情後大幅上升，入境處透過內部調配人手，於二○二三年三月六日至二○二四年十二月三十一日延長四間人事登記處的服務時段及於二○二三年十一月一日起增設觀塘（臨時）辦事處，以提升人事登記處的整體處理能力。入境處透過靈活調配人手應付對身份證服務的需求，並沒有就各人事登記處所涉及的薪金開支作分項計算。

（二）為提供更多會展設施以進一步促進香港會展業的長遠發展，政府正按計劃推展香港會議展覽中心附近的灣仔北重建項目，包括將灣仔北三座政府大樓、告士打道花園及港灣消防局用地重建為會展設施、酒店和寫字樓。

入境處總部已於二○二四年六月由灣仔入境事務大樓遷往將軍澳。位於灣仔入境事務大樓的人事登記處—港島辦事處（人事登記港島辦事處）目前仍在原址為市民提供服務。為配合灣仔北重建計劃，入境處正為人事登記港島辦事處在區內物色合適的辦公室，以重置該辦事處。該辦事處的重置時間及地點，須視乎實際情況，包括灣仔北重建計劃的進度、辦事處的運作需要和服務需求。待人事登記港島辦事處搬遷計劃的細節落實後，入境處會適時作出公布。

（三）及（四）入境處在重置人事登記港島辦事處時，會考慮交通暢達性、公眾服務需求及辦事處運作需要等準則，確保選址便利市民。入境處並會持續檢視其辦事處的服務安排和運作，研究將目前分散於不同地點的入境處辦公室和設施整合的可行性，為市民提供更便捷和優質的服務。

（五）為配合「智慧政府」的發展，入境處一直善用科技提升服務效率，包括透過設於各區辦事處的不同自助服務站，為特定個人證件服務提供自助申請和領證的選項。

入境處於去年十二月提升「申請個人證件服務站」的功能，推出自助申請香港身份證服務，讓合資格的申請人可以全自助形式辦理登記身份證的手續，以及透過服務站一站式辦理身份證和香港特別行政區護照申請。市民無需預約，便可於具有身份認證、拍攝照片、資料輸入及電子付款功能的自助服務站辦理個人證件申請。至於領證方面，「領取個人證件服務站」則整合了現有領取證件服務站的各種功能，合資格的市民可以一站式自助領取個人證件。

目前，位於將軍澳的入境處總部共設置了54部全新的自助服務站，包括44部「申請個人證件服務站」及10部「領取個人證件服務站」。全新的自助服務站自推出以來運作暢順，亦廣受市民歡迎。入境處會考慮於重置後的人事登記港島辦事處加設全新的自助服務站，並在辦公時間以外開放，以更切合市民的不同需要，進一步提升服務質素。"

​立法會十五題：電動可移動工具,2025-07-30 11:52,2025-07-30 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000231.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上吳永嘉議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

隨着電動可移動工具（例如電動滑板車、電動滑板、電動單輪車、電動平衡車及電動輔助單車等）日趨普及，政府正研究規管電動可移動工具在香港的使用及其相關認證安排，並與相關部門進行法律草擬工作。據悉社會對上述工作的最新進展表示關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）當局預計何時完成制訂電動可移動工具的使用者守則及認證安排，以及何時向本會提交電動可移動工具的相關法例修訂；

（二）在相關修例工作完成前，當局會否在更多不同單車徑推行共享電動可移動工具試驗計劃；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於政府於去年六月回覆本會質詢時表示，當局會分階段在合適的情況下開放單車徑予市民使用電動個人移動工具，首階段考慮開放的路段需要有至少3.5米闊及連通度高的單車徑，然後視乎成效適時檢討是否開放更多合適的單車徑，當局有否為各條單車徑訂立開放時間表；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）鑑於有意見認為當電動可移動工具日後可於單車徑使用，該等單車徑的使用量應有所增加，當局會否為該等單車徑提供更多配套，例如急救站、小食亭和洗手間等設施；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來對推動綠色出行的新科技秉持開放態度，同時非常重視道路安全。電動可移動工具是由機械驅動，符合《道路交通條例》（第374章）中「汽車」的定義，因此現時必須領牌才可於道路或私家路上行駛。我們留意到電動可移動工具在世界各地日趨普及，但香港人口密集，人流量高、車流量大，有需要適當規管電動可移動工具的使用，才可用作有效且安全的短途出行選項。

就吳永嘉議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，現回覆如下：

（一）使用者方面，電動可移動工具的使用者必須年滿16歲及須佩戴頭盔。政府已成立包括業界代表和政府部門的工作小組，制訂《實務守則》，訂明電動可移動工具的技術細節、操作規則、安全提示及指引等。運輸署會繼續進行宣傳和教育的工作，灌輸正確的駕駛態度，讓市民安全及負責任地使用電動可移動工具。

產品規管方面，為確保產品安全，運輸署正就電動可移動工具制訂技術和安全要求，並計劃要求由獲第三方機構認可的認證機構測試各產品的技術規格及電機要求。電動可移動工具的生產商或代理須向認證機構申請認證，獲認證的產品會貼上二維碼認證標籤，方便市民及執法人員辨識。至於問題中提到的電池及電子設備，我們認為有需要根據國際標準進行認證測試，例如過度充電或放電控制、短路及過熱防禦、振動和機械衝擊測試等，以確保產品安全。

為確保產品認證在香港市場切實可行，運輸署早前已諮詢業界，業界一般認為安排合理。運輸署正物色具備條件的認證機構，並聯同香港生產力促進局合作草擬產品認證安排的細節，亦會繼續仔細考慮不同持份者的角色和責任，以規管產品安全，讓市民可安心選購和適當使用電動可移動工具。

政府正進行有關的法律草擬工作，糅合實際經驗以確保建議切實可行。由於議題涉及範圍廣泛，我們計劃於短期內向立法會交通事務委員會報告進展，並爭取在明年將修訂《道路交通條例》的條例草案以及新的附屬法例提交立法會審議。

（二）為了解電動可移動工具的實際使用和運作，運輸署已於將軍澳南及香港科學園附近的單車徑進行試驗計劃。當中，運輸署於二○二三至二四年在白石角進行共享電動輔助單車試驗計劃。該計劃運作大致順暢，並顯示共享模式需要適當配套（如充電池設施及充電頻率等），供政府在規劃電動可移動工具可使用路段時作參考。

（三）及（四）電動可移動工具可作為短途出行和首／尾程接駁鐵路站和車站等的代步工具，讓市民有更多主動出行方式選擇。運輸署已經積極與相關部門商討，在新發展區（例如洪水橋新發展區）建設全面的單車徑網絡，亦會在其他地區選取合適的單車徑，容納單車及電動可移動工具同時安全行駛，除非該些單車徑不符合特定的要求（例如闊度不足、與行人路或行車道交替頻繁等）。至於電動輔助單車，基於它們的操作模式近似單車，我們計劃容許它們在所有單車徑上使用。

此外，現時不少單車徑的附近已設有急救站（例如白石角和大埔海濱），小食亭或其他食肆，洗手間（例如科學園、將軍澳南海濱一帶、大埔海濱公園等）。政府也會繼續適時檢視在新界及新市鎮的單車徑和相關配套設施，推行改善措施，提升安全同時便利綠色低碳的生活模式。

至於能否開放單車徑以外的地點，政府理解市民對於電動可移動工具的接受程度不盡相同。在運輸署過去的調查中，有六成多受訪者支持在單車徑上使用經妥善規管的電動可移動工具，其餘三成多則持保留意見，關注其潛在風險和現有單車徑的空間有限。政府會小心考慮不同意見，以確保道路安全。"
LCQ15: Electric mobility devices,2025-07-30 11:52,2025-07-30 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000232.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Jimmy Ng and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

With the rising prevalence of electric mobility devices (EMDs) (such as electric scooters, electric skateboards, electric unicycles, electric hoverboards and power-assisted pedal cycles), the Government is studying the regulation of the use of EMDs in Hong Kong and associated certification arrangement. The work of drafting the legislative amendments is being conducted with the relevant departments. It is learnt that the community has expressed concern about the latest progress of the above work. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) when the authorities expect that the formulation of the code of practice for EMD users and the certification arrangements will be completed, and when will they introduce the relevant legislative amendments on EMDs into this Council;

(2) whether the authorities will implement trial of share EMDs on more different cycle tracks before the completion of the relevant legislative amendments; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that in the reply to a question from this Council in June last year, the Government indicated that it would open cycle tracks to the public for use of motorised personal mobility devices in phases under suitable circumstances, and that for the initial phase the cycle track sections being considered to be opened for use have to be at least 3.5 metres wide with high connectivity, and it would then review in a timely manner whether to open more suitable cycle tracks having regard to the effectiveness of the measures, whether the authorities have drawn up a timetable for opening various cycle tracks; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) as there are views that when EMDs can be used on cycle tracks in the future, the usage of such cycle tracks should increase, whether the authorities will provide more ancillary facilities for the cycle tracks, such as first aid stations, refreshment kiosks and toilets, etc; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government has always adopted an open attitude towards new technologies for promoting green commuting, whilst attaching great importance to road safety. As electric mobility devices (EMDs) are mechanically propelled, they fall within the definition of ""motor vehicles"" under the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374) (the Ordinance) and must be licensed before use on roads or private roads. We note that EMDs are becoming increasingly popular around the world. However, given the dense population and high passenger and vehicular flow in Hong Kong, we consider that EMDs should be properly regulated before they can be used to provide effective and safe short-distance commuting options.

In consultation with the Transport Department (TD), my reply to the question raised by the Hon Jimmy Ng is as follows:

(1) Regarding users, EMD users must be at least 16 years old and wear a helmet. The Government has set up a working group, comprising representatives from the trade and government departments, to formulate a code of practice to set out the technical details, operating rules, as well as safety advice and guidelines, etc, regarding EMDs. The TD will continue its work on publicity and education, instilling into EMD users proper driving attitude to ensure the safe and responsible use of EMDs.

Regarding product regulation, to ensure product safety, the TD is formulating technical and safety requirements for EMDs, and plans to require third-party accredited certification bodies to test the technical specifications as well as the electrical and mechanical requirements of the various products. Manufacturers or agents of EMDs will be required to apply to the certification bodies for certification of products, and certified products will be affixed with a QR code certification label for easy identification by the public and enforcement officers. With regard to the batteries and electronic devices mentioned in the question, we consider that it is necessary for them to be certified according to international standards, e.g. over-charging or discharging control, short-circuit and overheating protection, vibration and mechanical shock tests, to ensure product safety.

To ensure that the product certification is practical in the Hong Kong market, the TD has been consulting the trade, who generally finds the proposed arrangements reasonable. The TD is identifying certification bodies that possess the relevant capabilities and is working in collaboration with the Hong Kong Productivity Council to formulate the details of the relevant certification arrangements, and will continue to give careful consideration to the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders with a view to regulating product safety, so that members of the public can feel confident when purchasing EMDs and use them properly.

The Government is undertaking the relevant law drafting work, and will take into consideration the actual experience to ensure the practicality of the proposal. As the topic has a wide coverage, we plan to report the progress to the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Transport shortly, with the aim of introducing the Bill for amending the Ordinance and the new subsidiary legislation into the LegCo for scrutiny next year.

(2) To understand the actual usage and operation of EMDs, the TD had conducted site trials on the cycle tracks in Tseung Kwan O South and on those adjacent to the Hong Kong Science Park. In particular, the TD carried out a trial scheme on the shared use of power-assisted pedal cycles in Pak Shek Kok from 2023 to 2024. The implementation of the trial scheme was smooth in general and the results indicate that suitable ancillary facilities (e.g. battery facilities and frequency of charging) will be needed for the operation of the shared mode. The Government will make reference to such experience when planning for the road sections for use of EMDs.

(3) and (4) EMDs can serve as commuting means for short-distance travel and first-mile/last-mile connectivity to and from railway stations and stations etc, providing the general public with more options of active transport modes. The TD has been proactively discussing with relevant departments the construction of comprehensive cycle track networks in new development areas (such as the Hung Shui Kiu New Development Area), and will select suitable cycle tracks in other areas that can accommodate the safe co-use of bicycles and EMDs, except those cycle tracks which do not fulfil the particular requirements (e.g. insufficient width or frequent crossings with pedestrian footpath and vehicular roads). As for power-assisted pedal cycles, we propose allowing them to be used on all cycle tracks since their operating mode is similar to that of bicycles.

In addition, places around many cycle tracks are already provided with first aid posts (e.g. Pak Shek Kok Promenade and Tai Po waterfront), refreshment kiosks or other eateries, and toilets (e.g. the Science Park, the vicinity of Tseung Kwan O South waterfront, and the Tai Po Waterfront Park). The Government will continue to review the cycle tracks and ancillary facilities in the New Territories and new towns and implement improvement measures, with a view to enhancing safety while facilitating a green and low-carbon lifestyle.

With regard to whether it is possible to open locations other than cycle tracks, the Government understands that public acceptance of EMDs varies. In previous surveys conducted by the TD, over 60 per cent of the respondents supported the use of properly regulated EMDs on cycle tracks, while the remaining 30-odd per cent of the respondents expressed reservation, with the main concerns being the potential risks of EMDs as well as the limited space of existing cycle tracks. The Government will carefully consider the differing views to ensure road safety."
立法會七題：建造業棚架工程,2025-07-30 11:50,2025-07-30 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000256.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上馬逢國議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

政府早前宣布，由今年三月二十一日起招標的工務工程新建樓宇的半數工程合約須採用金屬棚架（而非傳統竹棚架），以提升工地安全。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否研究過去五年涉及在竹棚架及金屬棚架上工作的工業意外原因（例如由於竹棚架結構不安全、施工程序不恰當或人為因素等原因）；

（二）現時相關政府部門監管建造業使用棚架的詳情為何，包括會否就一些使用期較長的建築棚架進行持續檢查；

（三）有否統計，過去五年建造業涉及竹棚架及金屬棚架工程的產值、現有從業員的數目（包括經培訓取得合資格人數及在職人數），以及從業員的平均收入為何；

（四）有否研究金屬棚架與竹棚架在搭建方法和對工人的要求上有否不同，以及所需的設施和涉及的勞動力成本的差異為何；

（五）鑑於有意見指出竹棚架仍然是本港建造業界普遍使用的構建物，隨着建築物的高度要求不斷上升，加上過去數年曾出現超級颱風和世紀暴雨，政府會否與業界合作研究提升搭建竹棚架技術，以加強其安全性；及

（六）鑑於「戲棚搭建技藝」是香港的「非物質文化遺產」清單項目之一，政府有否研究該項目所指的搭建技藝是否包括建造業的「築棚」或搭建竹棚架技術；若有研究而結果為是，政府就建造業搭建竹棚架技術的傳承和推廣所擬定的計劃為何；若未有研究，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

從工業安全的角度而言，只要遵守法例及相關工作守則的要求，不論採用何種物料的棚架均可確保施工安全。

由於國際和內地先進城市均在建造工程常採用金屬棚架，為進一步推廣應用金屬棚架，發展局早前要求在二○二五年三月二十一日或以後招標的政府工務工程新建樓宇項目（不包括樓宇外牆維修項目）的半數工程合約採用金屬棚架，而根據今年招標的項目數量，實際上只有一至兩個項目會採用金屬棚架。政府現階段無意取締竹棚架的應用，發展局會繼續與業界和其他相關持份者共同探討，如何從不同方面採取措施（包括科技的應用）提升竹棚架工作安全。

就馬逢國議員的提問，經諮詢發展局及文化體育及旅遊局後，現綜合答覆提問如下：

（一）根據過往調查發現，引致竹棚架及金屬棚架意外的常見因素包括施工前沒有進行針對性的風險評估及制訂合適的施工方案，導致施工期間欠缺規劃及協調；不當地改動棚架；同時在棚架上進行不相容的工作而影響其穩固性；沒有為工人提供合適工作平台；沒有提供及確保搭建或拆卸棚架工人使用合適的個人防護裝備；以及沒有足夠的安全監督等。此外，部份個案亦涉及工人沒有落實執行職業安全及健康（職安健）措施，導致意外發生。

（二）現行職安健法例已有具體條文規管棚架安全，勞工處亦發出《金屬棚架工作安全守則》及《竹棚架工作安全守則》，就搭建、更改、拆卸及使用棚架的安全向持責者提供實務指引。

按現行相關職安健法例，不論棚架使用時間的長短，承建商均須確保棚架在首次使用前及緊接每次使用前14天內由合資格（即完成棚架實質訓練及有實際經驗）的人士檢查，並按認可表格作出報告。若合資格人士檢查時發現棚架不安全，承建商須即時改善，以確保棚架能持續安全地使用。

此外，勞工處亦會不時在巡查期間抽查棚架，並密切留意棚架的狀況，包括其構造、穩定性，受天氣影響的情況、承建商有否恰當地使用等因素，確保承建商履行棚架安全的責任。

除了恆常巡查外，勞工處亦會針對棚架作業安全進行特別執法行動。如發現違反職安健法例，會嚴厲執法，包括發出書面警告、「敦促改善通知書」、「暫時停工通知書」及提出檢控。當發出「敦促改善通知書」或「暫時停工通知書」後，勞工處會按既定程序適時巡查跟進，直至承建商已採取充分措施消除有關危害。

與此同時，勞工處也會透過宣傳推廣、教育培訓及利用創新科技等多管齊下的策略，防止意外發生。

另一方面，為進一步加強工務工程棚架工作的監管，發展局在二○二五年二月要求工務工程的承建商和駐工地人員採取額外行政措施，包括要求承建商和駐工地人員每天均須獨立檢查棚架連牆器的數量，及合資格的人根據法規要求檢查棚架時，必須提交相片或錄影紀錄作為佐證。

（三）截至二○二五年六月，根據《建造業工人註冊條例》（第583章）註冊的棚架工統計數字如下：




工種分項
註冊半熟練技工
註冊熟練技工
總數


竹棚工
491
2 043
2 534


金屬棚架工
1 761
6 069
7 830


棚架工（全科）（註）
72
204
276




根據政府統計處於二○二五年四月發出的有關從事公營建築工程的工人的每日平均工資統計報告，「棚架工」（包括金屬棚架工和竹棚工）每日平均工資為$1,512.2。

註：同時擁有竹棚工和金屬棚架工的相關證書。

（四）金屬棚架與竹棚架在搭建方法、物料使用及對工人的工藝技術要求各有不同。勞工處發出的《金屬棚架工作安全守則》及《竹棚架工作安全守則》分別詳述金屬棚架及竹棚架作業的安全及健康管理、棚架安全的技術要求、棚架工人所需具備的資歷，以及棚架檢查、維修及拆卸等提出實務指引。

根據工務工程新建樓宇合約的經驗，使用金屬棚架不會大幅提高工程造價，其整體開支大約只佔樓宇建造工程合約金額的百分之二，而使用竹棚架則約為百分之一。

（五）為加強建造業竹棚架的安全，去年勞工處諮詢業界後修訂了《竹棚架工作安全守則》。主要修訂內容包括加強對竹棚架的支撐、連牆器（俗稱「拉掹」）及進出口的技術要求；禁止擅自改動竹棚架包括連牆器；更詳細說明合資格的人在監督竹棚架工人進行架設、相當程度上的擴建、更改或拆卸竹棚時及在惡劣天氣前進行檢查的要求。該工作守則亦要求進行懸空式竹棚架（俗稱「飛棚」）工作的工人，須持有由建造業議會發出的有效「高級懸空式棚架安全訓練」或「中級懸空式棚架安全訓練」證明書，才可進行指定的飛棚工作。

勞工處會繼續與業界及相關專業人士保持溝通，不時檢討並研究引進更先進的技術和管理方法，以確保竹棚架工作的安全。

（六）「戲棚搭建技藝」是「香港非物質文化遺產清單」（非遺清單）的項目。「戲棚」是地方籌辦神誕、太平清醮或盂蘭勝會時，由竹、杉木及鋅鐵片搭蓋而成的臨時場所，用以上演「神功戲」或進行相關的節慶活動。為建築物相關工程而搭建的竹棚有別於「戲棚」，並不是非遺清單內的項目。就公眾建議將有價值的傳統項目納入非遺清單，康樂及文化事務署轄下非物質文化遺產辦事處在收到建議後會進行調硏工作，並交由非物質文化遺產項目委員會及非物質文化遺產諮詢委員會審議及考慮。"

  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference.

Question:

  The Government has earlier on announced that 50 per cent of new public works building works contracts, with tenders to be invited on or after March 21 this year, are required to adopt metal scaffolding (rather than traditional bamboo scaffolding) to enhance site safety. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has looked into the causes of industrial accidents that involved working on bamboo scaffolds and metal scaffolds in the past five years (e.g. unsafe bamboo scaffolding structures, improper work procedures, or human factors);

(2)of the details of current monitoring of the use of scaffolding in the construction industry by the government departments concerned, including whether regular inspections are conducted on construction scaffolds with longer service spans;

(3)whether it has compiled statistics on the output value of construction works involving bamboo scaffolding and metal scaffolding in the past five years, the number of existing practitioners (including the number of those trained and qualified, as well as the number of those currently in employment), and the average income of the practitioners;

(4) whether it has studied if there are differences between metal scaffolding and bamboo scaffolding in terms of the construction methods and worker requirements, and their differences in the equipment required and the labour costs involved;

(5)as there are views pointing out that bamboo scaffolding remains a widely used structure in Hong Kong's construction industry, and in the light of the increasing height requirements for buildings, along with instances of super typhoons and once-in-a-century torrential rain in recent years, whether the Government will collaborate with the industry to explore ways to enhance the building technique of bamboo scaffolding to improve its safety; and

(6)given that the bamboo shed theatre building technique is one of the items in the Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of Hong Kong, whether the Government has studied if the building technique referred to in this item covers bamboo scaffolding or building technique of bamboo scaffolding in the construction industry; if it has studied and the outcome is in the affirmative, of the Government's plans for the inheritance and promotion of the building technique of bamboo scaffolding in the construction industry; if it has not studied, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  From industrial safety perspective, provided that the requirements of the legislation and relevant codes of practice are complied with, work safety can be ensured irrespective of what kind of scaffolding materials used.

  Metal scaffolds have been widely adopted in the construction industry in advanced economies in the world and the Mainland. To further promote the adoption of metal scaffolds, the Development Bureau (DEVB) recently required 50 per cent of new building works projects under public works of the Government (excluding maintenance projects of building façades), with tenders to be invited on or after March 21, 2025, to adopt metal scaffolds. Based on the number of projects to be tendered this year, only one or two projects will adopt metal scaffolds. The Government has no intention to ban the use of bamboo scaffolds at this moment. The DEVB will continue to engage the industry and other relevant stakeholders to jointly explore measures from various aspects (including the application of technology) to enhance work safety of bamboo scaffolds.

  Having consulted with the DEVB and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the consolidated reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Ma Fung-kwok is as follows:

(1)According to previous investigations, the common attributing factors leading to accidents involving bamboo scaffolds and metal scaffolds include failure to conduct task-specific risk assessments and formulate safe work methods before the commencement of work, resulting in lack of planning and coordination at work; improper alteration of scaffolds; performing incompatible work activities concurrently on a scaffold, affecting its stability; failure to provide workers with suitable working platforms; not providing and ensuring that workers erecting or dismantling scaffolds using suitable personal protective equipment; and inadequate safety supervision, etc. In addition, some cases were caused by workers' failure to implement occupational safety and health (OSH) measures.

(2)The current OSH legislation has specific provisions regulating scaffolding safety. The Labour Department (LD) has also issued the Code of Practice for Metal Scaffolding Safety and the Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety, providing practical guidelines to duty holders for safe erection, alteration, dismantling and use of scaffolds.

  According to the current relevant OSH legislation, regardless of the service spans of a scaffold, the contractor shall ensure that the scaffold has been inspected by a competent person (who has completed substantial scaffolding training and has practical experience) before being taken into use for the first time and at intervals not exceeding 14 days preceding each use. The competent person shall report his/her findings in an approved form. If the competent person finds that the scaffold is unsafe during the inspection, the contractor shall make immediate rectification to ensure the ongoing safe use of the scaffold.

  Moreover, the LD carries out spot check on scaffolds from time to time during inspections and pays close attention to scaffolding conditions, including their structures, stability, influence by weather conditions and whether being properly used by contractors etc., to ensure that contractors fulfill their responsibilities for scaffolding safety.

  Apart from regular inspections, the LD also launches special enforcement operations targeting scaffolding work safety. Stringent enforcement actions will be taken if there is violation of OSH legislation, including issuing written warnings, ""Improvement Notices"", ""Suspension Notices"" and initiating prosecutions. After issuing ""Improvement Notices"" or ""Suspension Notices"", the LD will conduct timely follow-up inspections in accordance with the established procedures until the contractor has taken adequate measures to eliminate related hazards.

  At the same time, the LD is also adopting a multi-pronged strategy, including publicity and promotion, education and training, and the use of innovation and technology, to prevent accidents from occurrence.

  On the other hand, to further strengthen the supervision of scaffolding work, the DEVB in February 2025 requires contractors and resident site staff (RSS) of public works contracts to implement additional administrative measures, including requiring contractors and RSS to independently check the number of putlogs of the scaffolds every day and requiring competent persons to submit photographs or video records as evidence when conducting inspections to the scaffolds in accordance with legislative requirements.

(3)The statistics of scaffolders registered in accordance with the Construction Workers Registration Ordinance (Cap. 583) in June2025 are as follows:




Trade Division Name
Registered Semi-skilled Workers
Registered Skilled Workers
Total


Bamboo Scaffolder
491

  According to the statistical reports of the Average Daily Wages of Workers Engaged in Public Sector Construction Projects issued by the Census and Statistics Department in April 2025, the average daily wage of ""Scaffolders"" (including metal scaffolder and bamboo scaffolder) is $1,512.2.

Note: Possessing the relevant certificates of Bamboo Scaffolder and Metal Scaffolder concurrently.

(4)Metal scaffolds and bamboo scaffolds are different in erection methods, materials used and requirements on workers' craftsmanship. The Code of Practice for Metal Scaffolding Safety and the Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety issued by the LD respectively set out detailed guidelines on safety and health management for metal scaffolding and bamboo scaffolding operations, technical requirements for scaffolding safety and qualifications required for scaffolders, and practical guidance on inspection, maintenance and dismantling of scaffolds.

  Based on the experience in public building works contracts, using metal scaffolds will not significantly increase the construction cost. The overall expenditure on metal scaffolds is only about two per cent of the contract sum, and the expenditure of bamboo scaffolds is about one per cent of the contract sum.

(5)To enhance bamboo scaffolding safety in the construction industry, the LD revised the Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety last year in consultation with the industry. The major revisions include enhancing technical requirements for bracings, putlogs and access and egress of bamboo scaffolds; prohibiting unauthorised alteration of bamboo scaffolds including putlogs; and further specifying the requirements of competent persons supervising bamboo scaffolders who perform erection, substantial addition, alteration or dismantling of bamboo scaffolds, and conducting inspections prior to inclement weather. The Code of Practice also requires all workers who perform truss-out bamboo scaffold work shall hold a valid certificate of ""Advanced Level Truss-out Scaffolder Safety Training"" or ""Intermediate Level Truss-out Scaffolder Safety Training"" issued by the Construction Industry Council before performing specified truss-out scaffold work.

  The LD will continue to maintain communication with the industry and relevant professionals, regularly reviewing and exploring the introduction of more advanced technologies and management methods to ensure the safety of bamboo scaffolding work.

(6)The Bamboo Theatre Building Technique is an item listed in the Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of Hong Kong (ICH Inventory). Bamboo theatres, which are built of bamboo, fir and galvanised metal sheets, are used by the local communities as temporary venues to stage Shengong opera for appeasing gods and host related festive activities during the birthdays of deities, Jiao festivals or Yu Lan Festival. Bamboo scaffolds erected for building-related works are distinct from bamboo theatres, and are not included in the ICH Inventory. In response to public suggestions to include valuable traditional items in the ICH Inventory, the Intangible Cultural Heritage Office of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department will conduct survey and research upon receiving such proposals. The findings will be submitted to the Sub-committee on Intangible Cultural Heritage Items and the Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee for review and deliberation."
LCQ12: Safeguarding traffic safety of bus captains and professional drivers,2025-07-30 11:40,2025-07-30 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000262.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Gary Zhang and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

According to the Report of the Independent Review Committee on Hong Kong's Franchised Bus Service published by the Transport Department (TD) in 2019, the Government indicated that it would draw reference from the standards and latest developments of vehicle safety devices overseas, and require franchised bus companies to introduce in-vehicle safety devices to enhance bus safety. However, the number of casualties involving franchised bus traffic accidents announced by the TD has been on an upward trend since 2022. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of (i) the number of casualties of franchised bus captains caused by bus collisions and their percentage in the total number of franchised bus accidents in each of the past five years, and (ii) among such cases, the number of those in which the casualties of bus captains were caused by impacts on the front ends of the buses, with a tabulated breakdown by severity of casualties (i.e. death, serious injury and slight injury);

(2) as some members of the sector have relayed that the front ends of franchised buses lack structures that can withstand collisions, and in the event of collisions, the bus captains are often in a position of being impacted at close range with a higher risk of injury, whether the Government will consider enacting legislation to require the installation of protective devices such as airbags at the captain seats of franchised buses, so as to reduce the risk of injury to bus captains in cases of collisions at the front ends of the buses; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether the Government has, over the past 10 years, proposed relevant legislative amendments to safeguard the safety of bus captains and other professional drivers; if so, (i) of the main directions and contents of the amendments concerned, (ii) whether the amendments were proposed in the light of overseas standards and developments, or were initiated by the Government having regard to the current traffic situations in Hong Kong, and (iii) of the specific effectiveness of the amendments in safeguarding the safety of professional drivers; if the Government has not proposed such legislative amendments, whether it has plans to do so, and of the relevant timetable; and

(4) whether it has plans to introduce measures to further safeguard the traffic safety of bus captains and professional drivers; if so, of the specific plans and expected targets?

Reply:

President,

The Government attaches great importance to the safety of franchised bus captains and professional drivers and works collaboratively with the trade through various channels and measures to enhance the safety awareness of professional drivers, thereby ensuring the safety of both drivers and passengers. Having consulted the Transport Department (TD), our response to the questions raised by the Hon Gary Zhang is as follows:

(1) In the past five years, the number of casualties of franchised bus captains (i) in traffic accidents involving collision with franchised buses and their ratios to the total number of franchised bus traffic accidents; and (ii) in traffic accidents where the front end of the franchised bus was the first point of impact in collision are at Annex.

(2) Currently, the franchised buses operating in Hong Kong are manufactured in the Mainland and Europe, and all of which comply with international safety standards. They must be designed and manufactured in accordance with the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction and Maintenance of Vehicles) Regulations (Cap. 374A)(the Regulations). Under the Regulations, every bus must be constructed of suitable materials, and its design and construction methods must be able to withstand the loads and stresses that may be encountered during operation. All buses, whether imported as complete vehicles or assembled in Hong Kong, must pass the stringent vehicle examinations of the TD before entering service, with a view to ensuring that their structure, safety, and performance meet the required standards.

The main thrust of the international safety standards is to ensure the overall structural safety of buses, reducing the risk of injury to drivers in accidents. There is no mandatory requirement for buses to be equipped with airbags. According to bus manufacturers, if bus captains wear seat belts properly and sit securely on their seats, it will effectively reduce the risk of their heads and chests colliding with hard objects during collision, thereby minimising serious injuries. On the suggestion of installing airbags, due to the relatively large surface area of the bus captain's cabin, the large airbags may cause a strong impact on bus captains when deployed. Nonetheless, we will continue to take heed of the effectiveness of safety installations (including airbags) and study whether such installations can strengthen the protection of bus captains and how to effectively enhance the protection of bus captains.

The TD will continue to maintain close communication with bus manufacturers and franchised bus operators (FBOs). In line with the technological developments, the TD will encourage FBOs to conduct trials of and introduce suitable safety equipment to further enhance bus safety and protect drivers.

(3) and (4) The Government and public transport operators are committed to enhancing the safety of services and protecting the safety of professional drivers through various measures.

In recent years, the Government has been actively motivating the operators to enhance safety by leveraging technology. For example, since 2023, over 95 per cent of buses in the franchised bus fleet have been equipped with the driver management and control system. If bus captains engage in risky driving behaviors (such as speeding, sharp cornering, harsh braking and harsh acceleration), the system will issue driving safety warnings. It will also rate the performance of bus captains to encourage them to cultivate good driving habits and skills and continuously improve driving safety standards to prevent accidents during work. In addition, FBOs have widely adopted various advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including anti-collision and lane-keeping warning systems, and driver monitoring system to assist bus captains in safe driving. More than 2 000 franchised buses (i.e. over 30 per cent) (including all buses operating airport routes and some long-haul routes) have been equipped with the above ADAS and driver monitoring system. FBOs will install relevant systems on newly purchased buses gradually subject to circumstances.

On the other hand, it is crucial for professional drivers to maintain a good work-rest schedule to ensure safe driving. A proper work-rest schedule helps drivers stay alert at work and reduce the risk of fatigue driving.

The TD has formulated the ""Guidelines on Bus Captain Working Hours, Rest Times and Meal Break"" (Guidelines), requiring FBOs to ensure their compliance with the Guidelines in arranging duty rosters for their bus captains to provide them with adequate rest time. FBOs are also required to submit reports to the TD on a monthly basis. The TD also conducts regular surveys on the arrangements of bus captains' working hours, rest times and meal breaks. At present, all FBOs generally comply with the Guidelines in arranging rosters for bus captains. Additionally, the TD has required FBOs to include a module of sleep and fatigue management in their training programmes for bus captains. In December 2023, the TD issued the ""Practice Note on Franchised Bus Captains Fatigue Management"" to all FBOs, setting out good practices in preventing and managing fatigue for reference. For instance, FBOs should encourage and arrange regular health check-ups for bus captains.

The TD has all along been organising activities jointly with FBOs to enhance safety awareness of the trade. For instance, the TD held the Bus Safety Excellence Award Ceremony in 2024 and 2025 to commend employees (including bus captains, driving instructors, inspectors/regulators, and engineer/mechanic teams) with excellent performances in enhancing bus safety in daily operations, with a view to encouraging the trade to promote safety awareness with ongoing efforts.

For drivers of public light buses (PLB), non-franchised buses and taxis, the TD has also formulated guidelines on working hours for the trade and relevant operators to arrange work schedules in accordance with the guidelines. Drivers can refer to the guidelines to monitor their driving hours so as to avoid fatigue driving and ensure safety. Furthermore, the TD has been convening regular meetings with the PLB and taxi trades as well as distributing newsletters on a regular basis to remind them of safe driving. In collaboration with the Police, the TD has also been organising safety seminars for PLB and taxi drivers from time to time to promote safe driving knowledge and enhance their safety awareness."
立法會十二題：保障巴士車長及職業司機行車安全,2025-07-30 11:40,2025-07-30 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000242.htm,"​以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上張欣宇議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

根據運輸署於二○一九年公布的《香港專營巴士服務獨立檢討委員會報告》，政府表示會參考外國車輛安全裝置標準及最新發展，要求專營巴士公司引入車內安全裝置以提升巴士安全，然而自二○二二年起，運輸署公布的專營巴士交通意外傷亡數字呈上升趨勢。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年（i）專營巴士車長因巴士碰撞而導致傷亡的數目及其佔專營巴士意外總數的百分比，以及（ii）當中因巴士車身前端受到撞擊而導致車長傷亡的個案數目為何，並按傷亡程度（即死亡、重傷及輕傷）以表列出分項數字；

（二）鑑於有業界人士反映，專營巴士車身前端缺乏可抵禦碰撞的構造，一旦發生碰撞，巴士車長往往處於近距離被衝擊的位置，受傷風險較高，政府會否考慮立法要求在專營巴士的車長座位安裝安全氣囊等防護裝置，以減少巴士車身前端碰撞時車長的受傷風險；如會，詳情及時間表為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）過去10年，政府有否提出保障巴士車長及其他職業司機安全的相關法例修訂；如有，（i）有關修訂的主要方向及內容、（ii）該等修訂是因應外國標準及發展而提出，或是根據本港交通現況而由政府主動跟進，以及（iii）該等修訂在保障職業司機安全方面取得的具體成效為何；如政府未曾提出法例修訂，有否計劃提出修訂，以及相關時間表為何；及

（四）有否計劃推出措施進一步保障巴士車長及職業司機的行車安全；如有，具體計劃及預期目標為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府十分重視專營巴士車長及職業司機的行車安全，並透過不同渠道和措施，與業界攜手合作，提升職業司機的安全意識，以保障他們及乘客的安全。就張欣宇議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，現回覆如下：

（一）最近五年，專營巴士車長（i）於專營巴士碰撞的交通意外中的傷亡人數及其佔專營巴士意外總數的比率；以及（ii）因專營巴士車頭最先碰撞的交通意外中的傷亡人數載於附件。

（二）目前在本港營運的專營巴士由內地和歐洲製造，均符合國際安全標準，並須根據《道路交通（車輛構造及保養）規例》（第 374A章）的規定進行設計及製造。根據該規例，每輛巴士均須採用合適的材料；而其設計及構造方法亦須能抵受可能會在運作時遇到的負荷及應力。所有巴士在投入服務前，不論是整輛進口或在香港裝配，均必須通過運輸署嚴格的車輛檢驗，以確保其結構、安全及性能達標。

國際安全標準的重點乃確保整體巴士結構的安全，減低司機在事故中受傷的風險，並沒有強制巴士安裝安全氣袋。而巴士製造商表示，若巴士車長正確配戴安全帶，並穩固地坐於駕駛座位上，已可有效減低其頭部及胸部在碰撞中撞擊硬物的風險，從而減少嚴重傷害。就安裝安全氣袋的建議，由於巴士駕駛室表面空間較大，當大型安全氣袋展開時，可能對巴士車長構成強烈衝擊。無論如何，我們會持續留意安全裝置包括安全氣袋等的效能，並研究是否和如何有效提升對巴士車長的保護。

運輸署會繼續與巴士製造商及專營巴士營辦商保持緊密聯繫，因應相關科技發展，鼓勵營辦商試用或引入合適的安全設備，進一步提升巴士安全及保障司機安全。

（三）及（四）政府與各公共運輸服務營辦商一直致力提升服務的安全性，並透過不同措施保障職業司機安全。

近年，政府大力推動營辦商應用科技，以提升安全。舉例來說，自二○二三年起，專營巴士車隊已有超過九成半巴士配備司機管理系統。若巴士車長駕駛時作出危險駕駛行為（例如超速、急速轉彎、急煞車及急加速），系統會向車長發出安全駕駛提示，亦會向車長作出評分，以鼓勵車長養成良好的駕駛習慣及技巧，持續提升駕駛安全水平，避免工作時發生意外。此外，專營巴士營辦商現已廣泛應用防止碰撞和保持行車線警報系統等先進駕駛輔助系統，以及司機狀態監察系統，以協助巴士車長安全駕駛。現時有超過二千輛（即超過三成）專營巴士（包括所有行走機場巴士路線和部分長途路線的專營巴士）均已安裝上述的先進駕駛輔助系統和司機狀態監測系統。專營巴士營辦商會視乎情況，陸續為新購置的巴士安裝有關系統。

另一方面，職業司機保持良好作息安排對安全駕駛十分重要。良好的作息讓司機工作時能保持警覺，減少疲勞駕駛的風險。

運輸署制定了《巴士車長工作、休息及用膳時間指引》（《指引》），要求各專營巴士營辦商須確保巴士車長的編更安排符合《指引》，讓車長有足夠的休息時間，並每月向運輸署提交報告。運輸署亦會定期調查車長的工作、休息及用膳時間安排。現時，各營辦商的編更安排普遍符合《指引》。另外，運輸署亦要求專營巴士營辦商於車長的培訓課程中加入睡眠及疲勞管理課程，並於二○二三年十二月向各營辦商發出《巴士車長疲勞管理實務守則》，列出有關良好防止及管理疲勞的做法以作參考，例如營辦商應鼓勵並安排車長定期進行健康檢查。

運輸署亦一直與專營巴士營辦商合作舉辦活動，加強業界的安全意識。舉例來說，運輸署於二○二四年及二○二五年舉行了巴士安全卓越獎頒獎典禮，以表揚在日常運作中提升巴士安全表現的優秀員工（包括巴士車長、駕駛導師、車務督察／巴士站長，以及工程師／技工團隊），藉此鼓勵業界持續推動巴士的運作安全。

至於公共小巴、非專營巴士及的士司機方面，運輸署亦有為業界制定工作時間指引，讓業界及相關服務營辦商根據指引編訂司機的工作安排。司機們可以參考指引，留意自己的駕駛時數，避免在疲勞狀態下駕駛，保障安全。除此之外，運輸署一直與公共小巴及的士業界定期會面，並定期透過派發通訊，提醒業界注意公共小巴及的士司機的駕駛安全。運輸署與警方亦不時為公共小巴及的士司機舉辦安全講座，宣傳駕駛安全知識，提升他們的安全意識。"

Through a series of annual comic events, the initiatives showcased the creative talent and outstanding works of Hong Kong comic artists. These efforts not only presented local comic artists' excellent creations to both international and local audiences, but also fostered exchange and collaboration between the Hong Kong comic industry and its international counterparts.

The HKCSP pavilion was successfully held from July 25 to 29, attracting an enthusiastic response with approximately 60 000 visitors recorded over the five-day exhibition period. Meanwhile, the conference, themed ""The New Global Wave of Comics: Resonating with the New Generation"" took place from July 24 to 25, bringing together representatives from 11 countries or regions to engage in in-depth discussions on topics including creativity, market trends, industry development, and publishing strategies.

Acting Commissioner for Cultural and Creative Industries, Mrs Lowell Cho, said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been continuously nurturing local comic artists and supporting the sustainable growth of Hong Kong comic enterprises through the ""CreateSmart Initiative"" (CSI) funding, with a view to consolidating Hong Kong's position as a hub for the creative industry in Asia and promoting Hong Kong comics on the global radar.

The fourth edition of HKCSP is one of the flagship projects under the CSI. It aims to discover and nurture emerging local comic talents while promoting the development of original comics in Hong Kong. This year, 16 selected local enterprises showcased their newly published original comic works with the support of the CSI at the HKCSP pavilion. The lead artists were also present to interact and engage with readers on-site.

Since the launch of HKCSP, including the past three editions, the programme has successfully published 63 original comic works and secured over 30 licensing agreements for foreign-language editions, effectively expanding into overseas markets. Several emerging comic artists who participated in the programme, including Chivas Leung (1st HKCSP), Man Tsang (1st HKCSP), Pen So (1st and 3rd HKCSP), and Bonnie Pang (2nd HKCSP), won prestigious international awards or garnered attention from international publishers through their creations under the programme. Their success in entering the global market underscored the international competitiveness of Hong Kong comics. Among the emerging comic artists, Pen So, with the Gold Award- winning work from 3rd HKCSP ""Dali Libreria"", won the Grand Publishing Award of the Hong Kong Publishing Biennial Awards 2025, and alongside Man Tsang and Kwong Chi Kit (1st and 2nd HKCSP), was invited to represent Hong Kong at the International Comic Artist Conference to share their creative insights.

Hong Kong returned as host of the International Comic Artist Conference, following its hosting of the 14th edition of the conference in 2013, signifying the importance and influence of the local comic industry on the international stage. The conference featured the ""International Comics Exhibition"" in the ACGHK, showcasing over 400 outstanding original works from 12 countries or regions. Visitors had the opportunity to appreciate a diverse range of classic and emerging comic works from around the world, thereby further promoting the exchange of the global comics culture."

Question:

 The Innovation and Technology Commission announced in June this year the introduction of an enhancement to the New Industrialisation Funding Scheme (NIFS) (the enhancement measure) whereby applications seeking funding support of no more than $2.8 million will be processed according to the newly established streamlined procedures to speed up the process of approving applications. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as the 2022 Policy Address envisaged subsidising the setting up of more smart production lines in Hong Kong under NIFS with the target of increasing the cumulative number of smart production lines by four times from about 30 back then to over 130 in five years, of the current progress in achieving the target; whether the authorities will consider raising the target number of smart production lines in the light of the progress in achieving the target;

(2) of the specific details of the streamlined procedures under the enhancement measure; whether it has estimated the extent to which the processing time for applications will be shortened after the introduction of the enhancement measure compared with that before the enhancement, and of the number of manufacturers as well as small and medium enterprises which are expected to benefit from the enhancement measure; and

(3) how the authorities will leverage and strengthen the advantages and solid foundations of traditional industries (such as the textiles and garment industry), and support their upgrading and transformation through the integration of innovation and technology, so as to promote the development of new quality productive forces and new industrialisation according to local conditions?

Reply:

President,

My reply to various parts of the question raised by Hon Tan is as follows:

(1) It is our target to have at least 130 smart production lines supported under the New Industrialisation Funding Scheme (NIFS) by 2027. Since the launch of the NIFS, 66 applications involving over 100 production lines were supported by the New Industrialisation Vetting Committee (the Committee). The projects cover various sectors such as food manufacturing and processing (including health food), textiles and clothing, construction materials, medical devices, biotechnology, nanofiber materials, new energy, pharmaceutical products (including Chinese medicine), electronics, printing, equipment and parts, and green technology, etc.The implementation progress is on track so far. The Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) will continue to review the progress and various arrangements under the NIFS, and will consider adjusting the key performance indicators timely having regard to actual circumstances.

(2) The latest enhancement measure for the NIFS aims to speed up the approval process of applications seeking funding support of no more than $2.8 million by streamlining the relevant documentation requirement and assessment procedures. Depending on the number of applications received, the ITC will increase the frequency of the Committee meetings as appropriate, and to submit the applications to the Committee for consideration and approval by circulation if needed.

 Currently, the ITC informs the NIFS applicants of the vetting results within 35 working days on average upon receipt of full information, including the necessary supporting documents and supplementary information. We anticipate that the average processing time can be further shortened following the implementation of the enhancement measure.

 Since the launch of the NIFS, approximately 40 per cent of the applications seek funding support of no more than $2.8million. The ITC anticipates that a number of applicant companies will benefit from the new enhancement measure, accelerating the establishment of more smart production lines in Hong Kong.

(3) New quality productive forces has to be developed according to actual circumstances and local conditions, which facilitate the upgrading and transformation of traditional industries with competitive advantages with the use of innovation and technology (I&T), while simultaneously improve the development ecosystem for new industrialisation.

We are committed to promoting the upgrading and transformation of the traditional manufacturing industry with the use of I&T through a series of policies and measures. These include enhancing the NIFS to support more manufacturers in transforming to smart production, as well as launching the two-year ""Pilot Manufacturing and Production Line Upgrade Support Scheme"" this year to provide funds to local manufacturers on a matching basis, encouraging them to adopt smart production technologies and upgrade their production lines. Furthermore, we will commence a study within this year on the medium to long-term development of new industrialisation in Hong Kong to explore the upgrading and transformation of the traditional manufacturing sector with the use of I&T and accelerate the development of new industrialisation.

By leveraging I&T to upgrade and transform the traditional manufacturing industry, we will advance new industrialisation more comprehensively. Through technological innovation driving industry innovation, we will foster the development of an I&T industry system, strengthen an institutional mechanism supporting new industry development, and enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness with a view to implementing the strategic deployment set out in the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint."
立法會八題：推進新型工業化的發展,2025-07-30 11:10,2025-07-30 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000207.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上陳祖恒議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

創新科技署於今年六月宣布就「新型工業化資助計劃」（資助計劃）推出優化措施（優化措施），申請資助額280萬元以下的項目將按新訂立的簡化評審程序處理，以加快審批申請項目的流程。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於二○二二年《施政報告》提出期望通過資助計劃資助更多智能生產線在港設立，目標是將智能生產線由當時的約30條，在五年間增加四倍至超過130條，目前有關目標的達標進度為何；當局會否考慮因應達標進度提升智能生產線的目標數目；

（二）優化措施下簡化程序的具體細節為何；有否估計推出優化措施後處理申請項目的時間會較優化前加快多少，以及預計受惠於優化措施的生產商和中小企業的數目為何；及

（三）當局會如何利用和強化傳統產業（例如紡織及製衣業等）的優勢和深厚基礎，並支援該等產業結合創新科技升級轉型，以因地制宜推動新質生產力和新型工業化發展？

答覆：

主席：

就陳議員各部分的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）我們的目標是在二○二七年將「新型工業化資助計劃」（「資助計劃」）下獲支持的智能生產線增加至最少130條。自「資助計劃」推出至今，「新型工業評審委員會」（「評審委員會」）已支持66宗申請，涉及超過100條生產線。項目涉及食品製造及加工（包括健康食品）、紡織及製衣、建造材料、醫療器材、生物科技、納米纖維材料、新能源、製藥（包括中藥）、電子、印刷、器材配件及環保等行業。「資助計劃」推行至今，落實目標進度符合預期，創新科技署（創科署）會持續檢視有關進度及「資助計劃」下的各項安排，並會因應實際情況適時考慮調整績效指標。

（二）「資助計劃」的最新優化措施旨在加快申請資助額280萬元以下項目的審批流程，簡化相關文件要求及評審程序。創科署亦會視乎有關申請個案的數量，適時增加「評審委員會」會議的次數，並在有需要時以傳閱方式將申請項目提交予委員會考慮及審批。

現時，創科署會在收到「資助計劃」申請者提交的所有資料，包括必須的證明文件及補充資料後，平均可於35個工作天內向申請者通知其審批結果。在優化措施實施後，我們期望平均審批時間可進一步縮短。

自「資助計劃」推出以來，約四成項目的申請資助額為280萬元以下，創科署預期一定數目的申請公司能受惠於新優化措施，加速在香港設立更多智能生產線。

（三）發展新質生產力須從實際出發，因地制宜運用創新科技協助傳統優勢產業優化升級，同時完善新型工業發展生態環境。

我們致力透過一系列政策措施，推動傳統製造業利用創科升級轉型，包括優化「新型工業化資助計劃」，支持更多生產商邁向智能製造；並將於今年內推出為期兩年的「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」，為本地製造業提供配對資助，鼓勵他們引入智能生產的科技方案及升級轉型生產線。此外，我們將於今年內就香港新型工業中長期發展展開顧問研究，探討如何利用創新科技助力傳統製造業升級轉型，加速推動新型工業化。

藉由創科促進傳統製造業升級轉型，我們將更全面推進新型工業化，以科技創新引領產業創新，促進創科產業體系發展，健全支持新型工業發展的體制機制，提升香港競爭力，落實《香港創新科技發展藍圖》的戰略部署。"

 The Clinical Trial Collaboration meeting provides strategic guidance on promoting clinical trial collaboration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, co-ordinating joint research efforts, supporting the launch of international multi-centre clinical trials, and addressing the challenges encountered during implementation. During the meeting, representatives from both Hong Kong and Shenzhen had in-depth exchanges and discussions on the Implementation Plan for Collaborative Advancement of International Clinical Trials in the GBA, with the goal of further strengthening co-ordination and driving execution of the initiatives.

 The executive bodies of the Clinical Trial Collaboration - representatives from the GBA International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI) in the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone and the GBA International Clinical Trials Center (BAY TRIAL) in the Shenzhen Park - also gave a progress report on key initiatives to advance clinical trial collaboration. This included the latest developments and proposed services of the GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform, which will be jointly established by the end of this year. The key areas include project evaluation, trial design consultation, and subject recruitment planning for multi-centre clinical trials, provided by a joint Shenzhen-Hong Kong advisory team; introduction of artificial intelligence technologies to assist with matching of clinical trial institutions and researchers, as well as offering consultation services; establishment of a co-ordinated ethics review mechanism between the two places to enhance approval efficiency; promotion of talent exchange, collaboration, and professional training; building of a research talent pool to facilitate talent mobility and regional collaboration; and as a pilot, the development of clinical databases and biobanks based on diseases in which Shenzhen and Hong Kong have advantages. In addition, the Shenzhen and Hong Kong sides also discussed further integrating the measure of using Hong Kong-registered drugs and medical devices used in Hong Kong public hospitals in the GBA with real-world studies in an effective manner, exploring the use of real-world data to support drug registration and approval in the Mainland at the meeting.

 The Clinical Trial Collaboration meeting today marks a critical step forward in enhancing co-ordinated development of clinical research and promoting biomedicine innovative application within the GBA, creating a good start for the Clinical Trial Collaboration. The simultaneous launch of the GBAICTI and the BAY TRIAL last year marked the beginning of a new chapter in cross-border collaboration under the ""one zone, two parks"" model by the ""one institute, one center"" framework, showcasing the joint commitment and concerted efforts of both places to promote medical innovation.

Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board convenes first meeting (with photo),2025-07-29 20:30,2025-07-29 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/29/P2025072900851.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of theHong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board:

The Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB) held its first meeting today (July 29). Members were briefed on experts' analysis of the latest developments in Hong Kong's port and maritime industry and discussed the strategy for positioning Hong Kong as an international maritime centre under the current geopolitical situation. With the target of developing Hong Kong into a ""global maritime capital"", the HKMPDB worked to formulate a more outgoing and comprehensive Mainland and overseas promotional plan, and identify key research areas for relevant committees to commence studies in the near term.

The Chairman of the HKMPDB, Dr Moses Cheng said, ""At today's meeting, members responded to the Government's call for adopting an innovative spirit and global perspective in exploring directions for consolidating and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international maritime centre, and setting out the key priorities for promotion and research. The HKMPDB will adopt a high-level and broad vision, complemented by actions as its core, to lead the four committees in taking forward various tasks with a view to bringing new vitality to the industry's development.""

During the meeting, members of the HKMPDB were briefed by the Shipping Research Centre of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University on the current situation, strengths, challenges, and opportunities of key segments within the Hong Kong international maritime centre (including port, high value-added maritime services, and the Hong Kong Shipping Registry). Members agreed that in the light of rising protectionism and complex geopolitics, Hong Kong should strive to develop the port industry and high value-added maritime services as its dual pillars, and establish itself as a safe harbour for international shipping enterprises in decision-making, transactions, innovation, financing, risk management, and dispute resolution.

As regards the strategies for Mainland and overseas promotional work, the HKMPDB will adopt a more proactive and comprehensive approach. In addition to regular visits to key maritime regions, new arrangements will be introduced to support members to go global to participate in prominent Mainland and overseas events by delivering speeches and telling good stories of Hong Kong maritime. Other key initiatives include deepening engagement and collaboration with influential international organisations, and continuing to attract international maritime organisations to hold conferences in Hong Kong. The meeting also identified priority research areas for the four committees which suitably echoed with the Government's policy priorities.

Lastly, members noted that the Transport and Logistics Bureau, in collaboration with three maritime arbitration institutions in Hong Kong, has been producing a promotional leaflet that clearly and practically explains the procedural steps to be taken by shipowners, charterers, or cargo owners before signing contracts for vessel chartering in choosing Hong Kong as the arbitration venue for maritime disputes. The leaflet will be distributed to relevant shipping enterprises and stakeholders in August and will also be uploaded to the HKMPDB website.

The Secretary for Transport and Logistics and member of the HKMPDB, Ms Mable Chan, said, ""The Country supports Hong Kong's strategic positioning as an international maritime centre. Driving forward the enhancement of quantity and quality of the Hong Kong Port; identifying new growth points for high value-added maritime services; deepening international engagement to elevate Hong Kong's global influence; and establishing a talent pool in light of industry trends such as green transformation, are currently pivotal issues for Hong Kong's maritime industry. The HKMPDB is charting its future work along these directions and has put forward various constructive suggestions. The Government will continue to collaborate with the industry in advancing high quality development of the industry together.""

The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HKMPDB will be established as a high-level advisory body to assist the Government in formulating policies for advancing the development of Hong Kong's maritime industry. The Government announced the membership of the HKMPDB and its four committees (namely the Port Development Committee, the Maritime Services Development Committee, the Promotion and External Relations Committee, and the Manpower Development Committee) in June this year. The HKMPDB successfully held its first meeting today, and the respective committees will convene their meetings over the next two months."
​民政及青年事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-07-29 20:12,2025-07-29 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/29/P2025072900751.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（七月二十九日）下午出席二○二五年「青年節@HK」啟動禮後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：今早黑雨，港島東的情況比較嚴重，想知道關愛隊有沒有做甚麼措施？出動了多少人和用了多少時間？

民政及青年事務局局長：今早的極端天氣是突然出現，由八時多到九時十分發出黑雨警告，其實是很短的時間。我很感謝18區關愛隊各位隊長和隊員，大家都有留意天氣報告，主動收集地區情況，即時收集地區一些出現水浸或其他情況，並通知民政專員，我們亦透過民政處（民政事務處）的網絡通知關愛隊隨時準備。為應對今早黑雨，民政處開放了10個臨時庇護中心供有需要的市民使用。但大家知道雨勢快來快去，所以使用的人不多，而關愛隊在這段時間亦全程候命，尤其是一些特別的區域，例如東區或南區，曾經受到暴雨影響的區域，所有關愛隊已早有準備，如有需要，會立刻協助當區有需要的居民疏散到庇護中心。但幸好今早雨勢快來快去，因此影響未算很大。

記者：益豐大廈的電力供應今日再次出現問題，據當局了解，管理公司的負責人到底有沒有到現場幫助居民？管理公司處理事件有沒有問題？會不會協助居民追究這家公司？這家公司是不是有意圖推卸責任給政府？翻查資料，這家管理公司也負責管理很多租置和私人屋苑，當局會不會擔心其他由這家公司負責管理的大廈日後會出現同樣問題？謝謝。

民政及青年事務局局長：大家都很關心益豐大廈的電力中斷事故。事故原因是星期六晚大廈本身的水管爆裂，浸壞了供電設施。因為這幢大廈並不是一般的三無大廈，即是說他們有法團，又有專業的物業管理公司，所以事故出現後，居民當然是聯絡大廈管理處，但發覺管理處不能夠提供即時幫助，所以居民亦向當區區議員反映，所以區議員去到現場，大家也看到這個情況。

大廈法團的業主，他們都沒有經驗處理，也是靠專業的物業管理公司。大家可能記得，我們已為全港的物業管理公司設立發牌制度，每間管理公司都有持牌人，除了管理公司的持牌人，物管人員也需持牌，即是說不單公司需持牌，管理人員也需持牌。物監局（物業管理業監管局）發牌予物管公司和物管人員也有不同的操守守則，英文是Code of Conduct，其中一個操守守則是處理緊急情況，每間物業管理公司需要為所負責的樓宇，制訂出現緊急事故時的預備方案。甚麼是緊急事故？在物監局發給物管公司的指引內清楚列明，當中包括電力中斷。所以在電力供應暫停時要如何處理，包括需要一位持牌的物管人員到現場提供協助，或為業主提供專業意見，或找合適維修人員進行緊急維修工程等，這些全部已包括在物監局發給物業管理公司的指引內。這次事故後，我們要看看相關的物管公司，既然已是物監局下持牌的管理公司，以及其負責人也是持牌的物管人員，他們有沒有按照守則辦事？除了守則外，還有良好作業指南，教導人員如何處理突發事故，所以我們一定會跟進。

就益豐大廈事故，我們看到當時的情況，包括管理公司未能精確、準確地告訴居民究竟他們打算如何協助法團進行維修工程，令電力供應能夠盡快恢復。如果大家有印象，最初是表示不知道何時恢復電力，後來表示可能一星期後恢復電力，這個情況自然是不理想。不要說天氣炎熱與否，香港市民都不會接受家中突然停電，還要不知何時才復電，又或一個星期後才復電。所以當時透過區議員、立法會議員和關愛隊的反映，民政處也發揮了協調作用，協調中電（中華電力有限公司）、機電署（機電工程署）一起為這幢大廈想出解決電力中斷問題的方案。最終，我們感謝中國建築（中建）的社區應急義工隊，他們協助進行一些緊急維修工程，所以益豐大廈的電力供應，在星期六晚上，即星期日凌晨，其中電錶房損壞程度較少的兩座大廈已恢復供電。餘下兩座電錶房損壞程度較大的大廈，透過中電和中建義工隊和機電署同事協助他們找出新方案，不是維修舊的電錶房，而是用新的方法搭電，令餘下兩座大廈在不足48小時內恢復供電，比管理公司預期的日子快上幾日。

能令益豐大廈電力中斷事故提早幾日恢復供電，我要感謝中電和機電署同事，為大廈想出新的方案，還要感謝中國建築社區應急義工隊，在市民最需要幫忙時為這座大廈進行緊急維修工程。但我們強調，大廈管理和設施維修一定是業主的責任。而業主們成立業主立案法團，聘請了專業物業管理公司，這些物業管理公司便有責任為屋苑和大廈樓宇提供專業的支持，協助業主立案法團和業主進行妥善的維修保養工作。

我藉這次機會呼籲全港業主，大家一定要齊心做好樓宇管理。因為若出現緊急情況，這次我們很幸運，社會有很多熱心人眾志成城參與，不單有中電、機電署和中建做了技術和工程支援，社區方面亦開放了兩個社區客廳給市民休息，而民政事務總署（民政總署）也開放了兩個庇護中心，加上康文署（康樂及文化事務署）提供的場地，總共有三個庇護中心。當晚因為到庇護中心的市民人數太多，甚至需要半夜跨區找設施安排給益豐大廈受影響的居民。這次多個政府部門、關愛隊、區議員和立法會議員，發揮了地區治理、眾志成城協助有需要居民的作用。但管理好自己樓宇的責任，一定是在法團和協助法團管理的物業管理公司上。我很希望日後大家都能盡好責任，好好管理自己的樓宇。

回答你的問題，究竟當日物管公司是否能夠提供適切的協助？我們稍後會研究。正如剛才我說，物監局發給所有持牌物管公司和物管人員的守則列明緊急事故時的處理方法，究竟有沒有妥善設計方案？是否有指定人士協助大廈在遇到緊急維修時要進行工程或工作？物監局同事一定會繼續跟進。

記者：益豐大廈本身有多張渠務修葺令和驗樓令，有了這些通知後大廈都未有修理，今次水管爆裂是否這些地方出事？整個事故是否與失修有關？另外，除了關愛隊外，有沒有優先請中電或機電署協助處理問題，而不是等待地區人士處理？

民政及青年事務局局長：剛才我提到關愛隊、區議員、立法會議員、中電、機電署、中國建築社區應急義工隊，以及民政事務總署、民政事務處和康文署的工作，大家都看到整件事有很多持份者，可能我有說漏了，還有警方、消防。不同部門於事發當晚都傾盡全力，出盡人手，出盡資源，解決市民最迫切要解決的問題，尤其是在那四棟大廈內有兩間安老院，院舍內的長者怎樣得到適當的照顧，還有包括社會福利署，所以你看到許多政府部門參與協助。

政府部門、社會各界、私人機構，大家都一起合力幫忙做好益豐大廈這事件，目的只有一個，就是希望能夠盡快恢復電力供應，令市民受到的影響減至最低。但是在大家一起眾志成城協助受影響居民的同時，作為物業管理公司，他們管理的責任是不能夠因此而忽略的。

所以正如剛才你提到的日常維修管理，這家物業管理公司有沒有協助業主立案法團做好維修工作，這也是稍後物監局會跟進的範圍。

記者：剛剛提到管理公司是持牌的，現在除了出事之後再去跟進或推出守則，之後會否加緊監管去確保他們是有做事？

民政及青年事務局局長：我要解釋背景讓你明白，自從物監局成立至今，本來非持牌的物管公司都已經持牌，即所有在香港協助業主立案法團、受聘於業主立案法團或業主組織，管理、做日常樓宇管理工作的物業管理公司和物管人，都會在物監局領取不同的牌照。

他們申請牌照時都需要符合不同資格，包括需要有專業學術資格或有工作經驗。而這些工作經驗和學術資格就正正是為何發牌給他們的原因，就是要確保當有事故發生時，他們有能力應對，還有在日常他們有足夠的專業知識，協助法團和業主進行這些工作。若有人未能做到的話，一定不能夠達到牌照條款內的要求，這個情況一定是物監局作為一個監管機構會去跟進的。

所以我剛才說，究竟他是不是有根據物監局提出的操守守則？因為物監局就專業物管人和物管公司發出了不同的操守守則，他們有沒有遵守這些守則，這個一定是物監局跟進的工作。物監局在成立的過去幾年以來，尤其是過去一年，當所有物管公司和物管人都需要領牌後，他們對於所有持牌的物管公司和物管人，有沒有按照《建築物管理條例》（第344章），以及在《物業管理服務條例》（第626章）這兩條條例下，要求物管公司盡責任，他們是非常嚴格監督的，亦都會就有問題的公司作出跟進，甚至是紀律行動。

記者︰知不知道大廈有那麼多張未遵辦的渠務修葺令和驗樓令？以及這次出事的渠是否與這些未遵辦的地方有關？

記者︰會否考慮追究這間公司？會否停牌？

民政及青年事務局局長︰為確保樓宇安全，建築署就不同樓宇可能會發出一些維修要求或修葺令。我們要確保這些命令能夠遵行，這個一定是，必定是，法律上都是，每一個業主的責任。所以我藉這個機會再次呼籲業主，當收到政府部門，無論是消防處發出的命令，還是建築署發出的命令，請各位業主盡快遵辦有關的命令。因為不遵辦，你不單需要承擔法律責任，第二就是當這些設施損壞時，受害受苦的都是自己。

很多業主提出，他們在召開法團會議或業主會議去管理他們的樓宇、執行這些命令時有困難。首先，發展局、建築署或市區重建局皆提供了很多不同的資助計劃，可以在現金上支援業主，就他們的樓宇進行相關的維修工程。民政總署也有一個大廈管理專業顧問服務計劃，如果一些大廈未成立法團，因沒有法團而開不了業主大會，執行不了這些命令，我們有一個計劃去協助這些大廈成立業主立案法團，協助他們營運，讓他們可以執行這些命令。同時最近我們提出「聯廈聯管」計劃，在一些舊區的老舊樓宇，戶數較少，樓齡較長的大廈，可以加入「聯廈聯管」計劃，由不同專業管理公司，協助他們召開業主大會和法團會議，為他們執行不同的政府維修令或消防令等，要確保每一個業主得到適當的支援召開會議，做好樓宇管理和維修工作。

我再次強調，這些命令發出後，請每一個業主都要嚴格遵守和遵行。因為你要負擔相關的法律責任，而且當這些設施受到損壞時，受害的會是自己。這個不是要靠別人告訴你，日日看着你做得如何，業主一定有自己的責任，而為甚麼他們要聘請這些物業管理公司，物業管理公司都有責任幫助業主，事實上持牌物業管理公司獲發牌時，給他們的操守守則其中一點，便是要協助這些業主組織召開會議，執行政府發出的各項維修保養或修葺命令，這些都是大家的責任。但是我們明白在執行這些工作時會有難度，所以我們就着一些樓宇業主，尤其是年長的業主，沒有經驗的業主，民政總署特別在今屆政府推出了不同計劃支援這些業主，方便他們召開會議，然後執行這些命令，我希望大家善用今屆政府提供予大家的支援和協助。我們有這麼多的計劃，請大家都可以善用。如果大家在處理這些問題時有任何困難，在完善地區治理後，第七屆區議會都很願意協助居民，做好自己自身樓宇管理的工作。區議會願意提供協助，民政總署也會提供協助，而更重要的是這些專業持牌的物管公司，他們要發揮到自己的功能和職責，協助業主組織遵行這些命令，大家一起做好樓宇管理工作。

我們再次藉這個機會，多謝過去幾日在益豐大廈，不眠不休、捱更抵夜的各個政府部門同事、立法會議員、區議員和關愛隊的隊長、隊員和所有義工，還有在社區裏，包括我所提及的一些機構，包括是中電、中建的社區應急義工隊，多謝大家在市民最需要的時候，提供了適切幫助，讓益豐大廈在這次電力中斷事件中，能夠較大廈或管理公司所定的目標提早恢復供電。在此多謝大家的努力，亦希望透過這次事件，引起大家對於妥善做好樓宇管理工作的關注。這個首要一定是業主的責任，亦是持牌物管公司的責任去協助業主組織。政府一定會願意提供所有支援協助業主遵行法庭或政府部門要求的維修令或要求，希望大家攜手做好樓宇管理的工作，讓市民都可以安居樂業。"

The Internet infrastructure and cybersecurity industries stakeholders must collaborate closely and remain vigilant.""

  The DPO will maintain close communication with the Internet infrastructure stakeholders and the cybersecurity industry to strengthen protective measures for digital infrastructure, enhance cybersecurity monitoring, threat intelligence sharing and analysis, and conduct large-scale cybersecurity attack and defence drills to improve the defence and response capabilities of relevant systems and teams.

研討會於七月二十八日舉行，旨在探討如何為所有學生提供公平學習機會，蔡若蓮博士以「香港的優質和平等教育」為題發表演講，從系統層面闡釋香港提供優質平等教育的政策措施和成果。

蔡若蓮博士表示，政府致力投資教育，確保教育資源平等分配，除通過公營學校提供12年免費小學及中學教育，亦透過多元支援機制照顧學生個別差異，促進全人發展。根據學生能力國際評估計劃（PISA）2022的結果，香港在教育平等方面在高學術成就的國家或經濟體系中排名第二，顯示家庭社經背景對學生的表現影響甚微。此外，政府實施幼稚園教育計劃，提供易於負擔的優質幼稚園教育，讓所有三至六歲學童按需要接受不同模式的幼稚園教育。現時約九成的半日制幼稚園課程免費，而全日制課程的學費也維持在低水平。

至於中小學教育，教育局訂定寬廣而均衡的學校課程架構，幫助學生建立堅實的知識基礎、培育正確價值觀和態度及發展共通能力，同時提供多元化的全方位學習活動，豐富學生的視野。配合香港中學文憑考試（文憑試）作為大學入學試，體現課程靈活而多元，既有傳統學術科目，亦有應用學習科目選擇，彰顯職普融通的概念，有助學生的生涯規劃。文憑試採用水平參照模式匯報考生的成績，符合國際水平，在本地及境外均獲廣泛認受性。

會上，蔡若蓮博士亦分享了教育局對非華語學生和有特殊教育需要的學生提供的針對性支援。教育局一直為非華語學生於學前教育至中學階段提供全方位的學習支援，以協助他們學好中文和融入社會。此外，教育局致力推廣共融校園，一向鼓勵學校以全校參與的模式支援有特殊教育需要的學生，推行建基於「平等機會、因材施教」精神的融合教育，讓有特殊教育需要的學生融入普通學校。

蔡若蓮博士指出，香港專上教育高度國際化和多元化，教學質量在多項國際比較研究中一直名列前茅，五所公帑資助大學更名列世界百強。除了政府大幅資助學費（87%），各大學亦為學生提供獎學金、助學金和貸款，確保符合資格的學生不會因經濟困難而無法接受高等教育。

政府致力發展香港成為國際專上教育樞紐，拓闊學生國際視野，吸引各地優秀人才。現時公帑資助大學約五分一學生和七成教職員來自香港以外地區，該些大學並與全球各地院校簽訂了逾2 600份學生交流協議。在泰晤士高等教育二○二五年度全球最國際化大學排名中，首四名均是香港公帑資助大學，成績令人鼓舞。

另外，政府大力推廣職業專業教育，發展應用科學大學，支持職業訓練局及其他專上院校開辦結合理論與實踐的應用型專上課程，推動產教融合、校企合作，為青年提供多元學習和就業機會及多元出路，培育更多掌握應用知識及技能的高質量人才。

蔡若蓮博士於七月二十七及二十八日分別與出席大阪世博學習主題周的聯合國教育、科學及文化組織代表、日本文部科學省官員、日本多所大學的代表，以及來自其他地方的教育界代表會面，商討加強教育合作交流。

她於七月二十七日與在日本從事基礎教育工作的香港人交流，了解當地基礎教育的最新發展。她同日與探訪日本交流團的香港中學生一同參觀堺市立町家歷史館，了解同學體驗學習的情況。

今早蔡若蓮博士禮節性拜會了中國駐大阪大使銜總領事薛劍，介紹香港最新的教育政策。另外，她也到訪了大阪產業大學孔子學院，並與該學院的師生會面，了解學院在當地推廣漢語學習及中國文化的經驗。蔡若蓮博士今日下午完成行程返港。"
SED shares Hong Kong's experience in achieving quality and equitable education in Osaka (with photos),2025-07-29 18:43,2025-07-29 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/29/P2025072900728.htm,"  The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, concluded her visit to Osaka, Japan, today (July 29). During the visit, she attended a thematic seminar under the ""Theme Weeks"" of the World Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, in which she shared Hong Kong's practical experience in delivering quality and equitable education with education representatives from different places and promoted Hong Kong's advantages as an international hub for post-secondary education.

 The seminar, held on July 28, aimed at exploring how to guarantee equitable learning opportunities for all. In her speech titled ""Provision of Quality and Equitable Education in Hong Kong"", Dr Choi outlined Hong Kong's policy measures and achievements in providing quality and equitable education at the systemic levels.

 Dr Choi said that the Government is committed to investing in education and ensuring equitable distribution of educational resources. In addition to providing 12 years' free primary and secondary education through public sector schools, it caters to individual differences and promotes whole-person development through diversified support mechanisms. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 results, Hong Kong ranked second in educational equity among countries or economies with high academic achievements, indicating that the family socio-economic status of students had minimal bearing on their performance. Moreover, the Government has launched the Kindergarten Education Scheme to provide good-quality and highly affordable kindergarten education, enabling all children aged from 3 to 6 to access different modes of kindergarten education based on their needs. Currently, about 90 per cent of half-day kindergarten programmes are free of charge, while school fees for whole-day programmes are maintained at a low level. 

 On primary and secondary education, the Education Bureau (EDB) has developed a broad and balanced school curriculum framework that helps students build a solid knowledge foundation, nurture proper values and attitudes, and develop generic skills. A diverse range of life-wide learning activities is also provided to enrich students' horizons. Coupled with the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) as the university entrance examination, the curriculum features flexibility and diversity, offering not only traditional academic subjects but also applied learning subjects for selection, which demonstrates the concept of convergence of vocational and general education and helps students plan their careers. Adopting the standards-referenced reporting system to report candidates' examination results, which is in line with the international standards, the HKDSE is widely recognised locally and abroad.

 In the seminar, Dr Choi also talked about the EDB's targeted support for non-Chinese speaking (NCS) students and students with special educational needs (SEN). It has been providing NCS students, from pre-primary to secondary levels, with all-encompassing learning support to facilitate their mastery of Chinese language for integration into the community. The EDB is also dedicated to promoting an inclusive learning environment. It has been encouraging schools to adopt the Whole School Approach in supporting students with SEN and implement integrated education based on the spirit of ""equal opportunities and teaching students in accordance with their abilities"", enabling students with SEN to integrate into ordinary schools.

 Dr Choi said that Hong Kong's post-secondary education is highly internationalised and diversified. The quality of teaching and learning is consistently ranked among the top in the international comparative studies, with five publicly funded universities ranking among the world's top 100.In addition to the Government's substantial subsidy for tuition fees (87 per cent), various universities provide scholarships, grants and loans to students to ensure that no qualified students will be denied access to higher education due to financial difficulties.

 The Government is committed to developing Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub to provide students with broader international perspectives and attract more outstanding talent from around the world. At present, around one out of five students and 70 per cent of academic staff of publicly funded universities come from outside Hong Kong. These universities have also signed over 2 600 student exchange agreements with institutions around the world. In the 2025 ranking of the world's most international universities published by the Times Higher Education, Hong Kong's publicly funded universities achieved encouraging results by claiming all top four spots.

 Furthermore, the Government has been actively promoting vocational and professional education and training. By developing universities of applied sciences, and supporting the Vocational Training Council and other post-secondary institutions' provision of post-secondary programmes of applied nature that blend theory and practice, the Government fosters co-operation between industries and education and collaboration between schools and businesses, and provides young people with diversified learning and employment opportunities as well as multiple pathways, with a view to nurturing more high-quality talent with applied knowledge and skills.

 On July 27 and 28, Dr Choi met representatives from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, officials of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, representatives from several Japanese universities, and education representatives from other places attending the ""Theme Weeks"" of the Expo to discuss further education collaboration and exchanges.

 On July 27, she exchanged views with a Hong Kong person working in the field of basic education in Japan to learn about the latest developments in Japanese basic education. On the same day, she visited the Sakai City Traditional Townhouse Museums together with Hong Kong secondary students participating in an exchange tour in Japan and learned about the students' experiential learning.

 This morning, Dr Choi paid a courtesy call on the Consul-General of China in Osaka, Mr Xue Jian, to introduce Hong Kong's latest education policies. She also visited the Confucius Institute at Osaka Sangyo University and met its teachers and students to learn about the Institute's experience in promoting Chinese language studies and Chinese culture in Japan. Dr Choi will conclude her visit this afternoon and return to Hong Kong."

SED shares Hong Kong's experience in achieving quality and equitable education in Osaka,2025-07-29 18:43,2025-07-29 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/29/P2025072900728.htm,"  The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, concluded her visit to Osaka, Japan, today (July 29). During the visit, she attended a thematic seminar under the ""Theme Weeks"" of the World Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, in which she shared Hong Kong's practical experience in delivering quality and equitable education with education representatives from different places and promoted Hong Kong's advantages as an international hub for post-secondary education.

 The seminar, held on July 28, aimed at exploring how to guarantee equitable learning opportunities for all. In her speech titled ""Provision of Quality and Equitable Education in Hong Kong"", Dr Choi outlined Hong Kong's policy measures and achievements in providing quality and equitable education at the systemic levels.

 Dr Choi said that the Government is committed to investing in education and ensuring equitable distribution of educational resources. In addition to providing 12 years' free primary and secondary education through public sector schools, it caters to individual differences and promotes whole-person development through diversified support mechanisms. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 results, Hong Kong ranked second in educational equity among countries or economies with high academic achievements, indicating that the family socio-economic status of students had minimal bearing on their performance. Moreover, the Government has launched the Kindergarten Education Scheme to provide good-quality and highly affordable kindergarten education, enabling all children aged from 3 to 6 to access different modes of kindergarten education based on their needs. Currently, about 90 per cent of half-day kindergarten programmes are free of charge, while school fees for whole-day programmes are maintained at a low level. 

 On primary and secondary education, the Education Bureau (EDB) has developed a broad and balanced school curriculum framework that helps students build a solid knowledge foundation, nurture proper values and attitudes, and develop generic skills. A diverse range of life-wide learning activities is also provided to enrich students' horizons. Coupled with the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) as the university entrance examination, the curriculum features flexibility and diversity, offering not only traditional academic subjects but also applied learning subjects for selection, which demonstrates the concept of convergence of vocational and general education and helps students plan their careers. Adopting the standards-referenced reporting system to report candidates' examination results, which is in line with the international standards, the HKDSE is widely recognised locally and abroad.

 In the seminar, Dr Choi also talked about the EDB's targeted support for non-Chinese speaking (NCS) students and students with special educational needs (SEN). It has been providing NCS students, from pre-primary to secondary levels, with all-encompassing learning support to facilitate their mastery of Chinese language for integration into the community. The EDB is also dedicated to promoting an inclusive learning environment. It has been encouraging schools to adopt the Whole School Approach in supporting students with SEN and implement integrated education based on the spirit of ""equal opportunities and teaching students in accordance with their abilities"", enabling students with SEN to integrate into ordinary schools.

 Dr Choi said that Hong Kong's post-secondary education is highly internationalised and diversified. The quality of teaching and learning is consistently ranked among the top in the international comparative studies, with five publicly funded universities ranking among the world's top 100.In addition to the Government's substantial subsidy for tuition fees (87 per cent), various universities provide scholarships, grants and loans to students to ensure that no qualified students will be denied access to higher education due to financial difficulties.

 The Government is committed to developing Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub to provide students with broader international perspectives and attract more outstanding talent from around the world. At present, around one out of five students and 70 per cent of academic staff of publicly funded universities come from outside Hong Kong. These universities have also signed over 2 600 student exchange agreements with institutions around the world. In the 2025 ranking of the world's most international universities published by the Times Higher Education, Hong Kong's publicly funded universities achieved encouraging results by claiming all top four spots.

 Furthermore, the Government has been actively promoting vocational and professional education and training. By developing universities of applied sciences, and supporting the Vocational Training Council and other post-secondary institutions' provision of post-secondary programmes of applied nature that blend theory and practice, the Government fosters co-operation between industries and education and collaboration between schools and businesses, and provides young people with diversified learning and employment opportunities as well as multiple pathways, with a view to nurturing more high-quality talent with applied knowledge and skills.

 On July 27 and 28, Dr Choi met representatives from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, officials of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, representatives from several Japanese universities, and education representatives from other places attending the ""Theme Weeks"" of the Expo to discuss further education collaboration and exchanges.

 On July 27, she exchanged views with a Hong Kong person working in the field of basic education in Japan to learn about the latest developments in Japanese basic education. On the same day, she visited the Sakai City Traditional Townhouse Museums together with Hong Kong secondary students participating in an exchange tour in Japan and learned about the students' experiential learning.

 This morning, Dr Choi paid a courtesy call on the Consul-General of China in Osaka, Mr Xue Jian, to introduce Hong Kong's latest education policies. She also visited the Confucius Institute at Osaka Sangyo University and met its teachers and students to learn about the Institute's experience in promoting Chinese language studies and Chinese culture in Japan. Dr Choi will conclude her visit this afternoon and return to Hong Kong."

香港海運港口發展局今日（七月二十九日）召開首次會議。成員聽取了專家就香港港口及海運業最新情況的分析，並討論香港國際航運中心在現時地緣政治局勢下的定位策略，以打造香港為全球航運之都為目標，制訂更外向、更全面的海內外推廣計劃，及鎖定重點研究領域，並交由相關委員會於短期內展開研究。

香港海運港口發展局主席鄭慕智博士表示：「在今日的會議上，成員響應政府以創新精神及國際視野，探討鞏固提升香港國際航運中心地位的方向，並訂立推廣及研究工作重點。香港海運港口發展局會以高層次及宏觀視野，並配以行動為核心，帶領四個委員會落實各項工作，為行業發展帶來新氣象。」

會議期間，香港海運港口發展局成員聽取了香港理工大學航運研究中心就香港國際航運中心各個主要板塊（包括港口、高增值海運服務及香港船舶註冊）的現況、優勢、挑戰和機遇。成員認為，因應現時保護主義抬頭和地緣政治複雜，香港應銳意發展為以港口業務及高增值海運服務為雙核心，促進香港成為國際航運企業進行決策、交易、創新、融資、風險管控、爭議解決的安全港。

在海內外推廣策略方面，香港海運港口發展局將採取更外向、更全面的部署。除了繼續定期出訪重要航運地區，亦會引入新安排支持成員「走出去」，參與知名海內外活動發表演講和說好香港航運故事。其他重點工作包括深化與具影響力國際組織的交往合作及繼續吸引國際海運組織到香港舉辦會議等。今日的會議亦鎖定了四個委員會的重點研究領域，適當地對應政府的政策優次。

最後，成員備悉運輸及物流局與香港三家海事仲裁機構合作製作宣傳單張，以顯淺實用的方式說明船東、租家或貨主選取香港作為海事爭議仲裁地時，在簽立船舶航程租用合約前應採取的步驟。宣傳單張將會在八月內向相關航運企業及持份者發放，屆時亦會上載至香港海運港口發展局網頁。

香港海運港口發展局成員之一的運輸及物流局局長陳美寶表示：「國家支持香港作為國際航運中心的戰略地位。推動香港港口提量、提質；為高增值海運服務業尋找新增長點；深化國際交往以提升香港國際影響力；以及為綠色化等行業發展趨勢建立人才庫，是目前香港航運業的重要議題。香港海運港口發展局正朝着以上方向規劃未來工作，並提出了多項具建設性的意見，政府會繼續與業界攜手，共同推動行業高質量發展。」

行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》宣布成立香港海運港口發展局，作為高層次諮詢機構協助政府制訂政策，推進香港航運業的發展。政府於今年六月公布香港海運港口發展局的委任名單和四個委員會的成員名單（即港口發展委員會、海運服務發展委員會、推廣及對外事務委員會，以及人力發展委員會）。香港海運港口發展局首次會議今日順利舉行，而各委員會亦將於未來兩個月內陸續召開會議。"

During the operation, Hong Kong Customs seized a total of about 58 million suspected illicit cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $260 million and a duty potential of about $192 million, and arrested five men.

Through intelligence exchanges with Singapore Customs, as well as risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Hong Kong Customs seized the batch of suspected illicit cigarettes in 13 seaborne containers from Singapore and arrested five male drivers, aged between 62 and 71.

Investigations into the related cases are ongoing. Customs will continue to trace the source and the flow of the illicit cigarettes. The likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

The outcomes of the operation fully demonstrate Customs' notable enforcement effectiveness on combating cross-boundary illicit cigarette activities at source through international co-operation. Customs will continue to maintain close liaisons and strengthen intelligence exchanges with Mainland and overseas law enforcement agencies to vigorously combat cross-boundary illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction. Moreover, under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

各位嘉賓、各位青年朋友：

大家好！很開心今日來到青年廣場，與大家共聚一堂，出席二○二五年「青年節@HK」啟動禮。

特區政府非常重視青年發展，透過舉辦及資助不同類型活動，鼓勵青年擴闊眼界，認識和把握多元發展的機遇。

我們於二○二二年推出《青年發展藍圖》，為青年健康成長和多元發展設定政策目標，並按社會和青年的需要不斷推出新措施。《藍圖》推出至今已制訂約250項具體行動和措施，致力培育青年成為愛國愛港、具備世界視野、有抱負和正向思維的新一代。

「青年節@HK」是《藍圖》的重點項目之一。由我擔任主席的青年發展委員會，轄下的「青年節行動小組」，匯聚社會各界的力量，同心協力籌辦「青年節」活動，凝聚廣大青年，讓他們發展潛能、增進知識、以及交流經驗。過去兩屆「青年節」，我們舉辦了超過400項活動，吸引超過40萬人次參與。

今年「青年節」主題是「正向思維」、「推動創新」及「啟發創意」，活動涵蓋多個亮點項目，包括藝術文化、知識交流、生涯規劃、創新創業和運動相關等多個範疇，項目多元豐富，動靜兼備，切合不同青年的學習需要和興趣嗜好，全方位促進青年的個人發展。

今年是中國人民抗日戰爭勝利80周年，我鼓勵各個青年團體及非政府機構，積極舉辦以抗戰勝利80周年為主題的「青年節」伙伴活動，加深青年對國家與香港歷史的認識，培養對民族的歸屬感與自豪感，傳承愛國精神。

今日活動在青年廣場舉行，亦別具意義。去年的《施政報告》提出，將改造青年廣場部分地方成為全新互動空間，讓青年人匯聚交流、發展個人潛能；部分空間還會設立視頻工作室，供青年製作視頻，宣揚「香港青年好故事」，並提供與製作和拍攝視頻相關的培訓。在這裏，我要特別感謝香港賽馬會慈善信託基金，除每年出資支持「青年節」活動，亦撥捐一億五千萬元，支持青年廣場改造計劃。

在座各位都是特區政府的重要夥伴，為青年鋪路搭橋，提供更大發展空間，創造更多機會。我代表特區政府對你們的付出和支持，致以衷心的感謝！

我期待社會各界繼續與特區政府並肩同行，全力落實《青年發展藍圖》，讓青年人發揮所長，為國家、香港和自己打造更寬廣的舞台。

今年「青年節」的口號是「正向新世代．未來更 『青』彩」。我鼓勵青年朋友，踴躍參加「青年節」各項活動，一起燃點青年人的力量，共同創造更精彩的未來。多謝大家！"

今年「青年節」主題是「正向思維」、「推動創新」及「啟發創意」，活動涵蓋多個亮點項目，包括藝術文化、知識交流、生涯規劃、創新創業和運動相關等多個範疇，項目多元豐富，動靜兼備，切合不同青年的學習需要和興趣嗜好，全方位促進青年的個人發展。

今年是中國人民抗日戰爭勝利80周年，我鼓勵各個青年團體及非政府機構，積極舉辦以抗戰勝利80周年為主題的「青年節」伙伴活動，加深青年對國家與香港歷史的認識，培養對民族的歸屬感與自豪感，傳承愛國精神。

今日活動在青年廣場舉行，亦別具意義。去年的《施政報告》提出，將改造青年廣場部分地方成為全新互動空間，讓青年人匯聚交流、發展個人潛能；部分空間還會設立視頻工作室，供青年製作視頻，宣揚「香港青年好故事」，並提供與製作和拍攝視頻相關的培訓。在這裏，我要特別感謝香港賽馬會慈善信託基金，除每年出資支持「青年節」活動，亦撥捐一億五千萬元，支持青年廣場改造計劃。

在座各位都是特區政府的重要夥伴，為青年鋪路搭橋，提供更大發展空間，創造更多機會。我代表特區政府對你們的付出和支持，致以衷心的感謝！

我期待社會各界繼續與特區政府並肩同行，全力落實《青年發展藍圖》，讓青年人發揮所長，為國家、香港和自己打造更寬廣的舞台。

今年「青年節」的口號是「正向新世代．未來更 『青』彩」。我鼓勵青年朋友，踴躍參加「青年節」各項活動，一起燃點青年人的力量，共同創造更精彩的未來。多謝大家！"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 28 to noon today (July 29), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 153 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).
