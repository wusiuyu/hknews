香港海關偵破非法進口動物案件（附圖）,2025-11-24 11:00,2025-11-24 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400263.htm,"​香港海關昨日（十一月二十三日）在羅湖管制站偵破一宗非法進口動物的案件，檢獲一隻懷疑非法進口貓，估計市值約二萬元。

海關人員昨日在上述管制站入境大堂截查一名五十六歲抵港女旅客，經檢查後在其背包內檢獲一隻貓，遂拘捕該名女子。

案件已轉交漁農自然護理署作跟進調查。

海關提醒市民，任何人未領有有效許可證而將動物輸入香港，即屬違法。

根據《狂犬病規例》，任何人非法輸入動物、動物屍體或動物產品，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁一年。"
兩名共同業主不遵從清拆令被判罰款逾五萬元,2025-11-24 11:00,2025-11-24 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400199.htm,"​兩名共同業主由於不遵從根據《建築物條例》（第123章）發出的清拆令，上周五(十一月二十一日)在屯門裁判法院被定罪及判罰款合共53,580元，當中33,580元屬就罪行持續的日數所判的罰款。

有關個䅁涉及元朗丈量約份第119其中一個地段上一個面績約140平方米的搭建物。由於有關僭建物不會獲地政總署發出豁免證明書，亦並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向該兩名共同業主發出清拆令。他們沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（十一月二十四日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"

Mainland Higher Education Expo 2026/27 to be held on November 29 and 30,2025-11-24 11:00,2025-11-24 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400193.htm,"  The Mainland Higher Education Expo 2026/27, jointly organised by the Office of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Affairs and the Department of College Students Affairs of the Ministry of Education (MoE), as well as the Education Bureau (EDB), will be held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on November 29 and 30. The Expo will provide students aspiring to pursue further studies on the Mainland and their parents with information on the arrangements of the Scheme for Admission of Hong Kong Students to Mainland Higher Education Institutions (Admission Scheme) for the academic year as well as on students' progression of study.

  Participating in the Admission Scheme are 165 Mainland higher education institutions (listed in Annex) from 21 provinces/municipalities and two autonomous regions of the Mainland, of which 157 will set up exhibition booths to provide information on aspects such as faculties and subjects, admission criteria and the number of student places. Representatives from the MoE will also explain the application procedures and admission arrangements of the Admission Scheme on-site.
       
  A number of sharing sessions will be held during the Expo, covering topics including an introduction by representatives of Mainland institutions to the characteristics of individual programmes, discussions of study experiences by Hong Kong students who graduated from Mainland institutions, and analyses of career prospects provided by guest speakers. The Expo also features an online platform (www.studymainland.hk) where all participating Mainland higher education institutions will set up virtual exhibition booths.

  In addition, the EDB has collaborated with the China Education Exchange (Hong Kong and Macao) Centre and Hok Yau Club to compile the Handbook on the Scheme for Admission of Hong Kong Students to Mainland Higher Education Institutions. The handbook provides comprehensive information on the Admission Scheme and further studies on the Mainland. It will be distributed free of charge at the Expo. The electronic version (Chinese version only) will also be available on the EDB's website (www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/tc/edu-system/postsecondary/policy-doc/pilot-scheme/scheme_2026/Handbook2026_27.pdf).

  The MoE has earlier announced detailed arrangements for the Admission Scheme for the 2026/27 academic year. The Mainland higher education institutions participating in the Admission Scheme admit Hong Kong students based on their Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examination results, thereby exempting them from taking the Joint Entrance Examination for Mainland Institutions and providing them with multiple study pathways and opportunities to connect with the country's development. The Admission Scheme for the 2026/27 academic year will be open for applications between December 1 and 31, 2025. Students who will sit for the HKDSE Examination in 2026 and are interested in pursuing further studies on the Mainland can enrol through the website of the Education Examinations Authority of Guangdong Province (eea.gd.gov.cn).
   
  Details of the Admission Scheme are available on the EDB's website (www.edb.gov.hk/admissionscheme)."
"Two co-owners fined over $50,000 for not complying with removal order",2025-11-24 11:00,2025-11-24 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/24/P2025112400200.htm,"âTwo co-owners were convicted and fined $53,580 in total, of which $33,580 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued at the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts last Friday (November 21) for failing to comply with a removal order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 140 square metres on a lot in D.D.119, Yuen Long. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the unauthorised building works (UBWs) and the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the co-owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (November 24), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-23 20:12,2025-11-23 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/23/P2025112300630.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 23), the CHP has recorded two new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
-----------------------------

The first case involves a 69-year-old male living in Yuen Long District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Yunnan between November 9 and 16. He developed joint pain on November 20. He developed a fever on November 22 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Pok Oi Hospital on the same day. He was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has one household contact and three other travel collaterals to Yunnan. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.
ã
The second case involves a 49-year-old female living in Kwai Tsing District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Zhuhai and Zhongshan in Guangdong between November 2 and 5. She developed a fever, joint pain and rash on November 21. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital yesterday (November 22) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has three household contacts who are also travel collaterals to Guangdong Province. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

ããAs the two patients have visited CF-affected areas for travel during the incubation period, the CHP preliminarily considered that the case was infected during his travel. The cases are classified as imported. The CHP will report the cases to the relevant health authorities.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 70 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

The CHP has recently recorded several imported cases residing in Kwai Tsing District who had a travel history within approximately two weeks before onset of illness. The CHP is conducting in-depth investigations and analysis of the movements the cases during their incubation and infectious periods, and has notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the places they visited for anti-mosquito operations.
â
Preliminary investigations by the CHP revealed that some patients had been hiking in the area of Tsing Yi Nature Trails before onset. The CHP is performing genomic sequencing and analysis on patient samples to determine whether these cases are linked. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urges members of the public who have been hiking in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails area since November 1, and who subsequently develop relevant symptoms, to seek medical attention as soon as possible and call the enquiry hotline (2125 2373) previously set up by the CHP. The hotline will continue to operate daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-23 19:35,2025-11-23 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/23/P2025112300612.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十三日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

首宗個案涉及一名69歲男子，居於元朗區。他於十一月九至十六日到訪雲南，於十一月二十日出現關節痛，十一月二十二日出現發燒，同日到博愛醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。他的一名家居接觸者及三名同行到雲南的人士，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

第二宗個案涉及一名49歲女子，居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於十一月二至五日與到訪廣東省珠海市及中山市，她於十一月二十一日出現發燒、關節痛和皮疹，昨日（十一月二十二日）到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，獲安排留院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。她的三名家居接觸者（亦為同行到廣東省的人士）暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於兩宗個案在潛伏期曾前往受基孔肯雅熱影響的地方旅遊，中心初步認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報相關衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得70宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

中心近日錄得數宗居於葵青區並在發病前約兩周內有旅遊史的輸入個案，中心正針對個案在潛伏期及傳染期的行蹤進行深入調查和分析，並已將他們曾經到訪的地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），以進行控蚊滅蚊行動。

中心的初步調查發現部分患者在發病前曾於青衣自然徑一帶行山。中心正就病人樣本進行基因排序及分析，以確定他們之間是否有關聯。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，須盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線（2125 2373），熱線會繼續每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及

​運輸及物流局局長出席「嘉里香港街馬2025」兩公里領袖跑起步禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-11-23 13:40,2025-11-23 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/23/P2025112300328.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十一月二十三日）出席「嘉里香港街馬2025」兩公里領袖跑起步禮的致辭全文：

今日風和日麗，是「全城街馬」的盛事，我感到很開心。剛才我在將軍澳主持10公里挑戰賽的起步禮，去年也在將軍澳參與了10公里精英賽的嗚槍儀式。這次很開心，特別多謝「全城街馬」的主辦單位，另外還有嘉里建設的冠名贊助，與路政署一起合作，趁着中九龍繞道（油麻地段）籌備得如火如荼，可以藉着參與全馬和半馬這個機會，讓跑手可以親身感受這個大型基建的工程。

說回這個基建項目，它的重要性不單是一條主幹道，還貫穿了九龍東、西，將活力十足的東九龍、啟德、觀塘以及九龍灣地帶連接到油麻地。西九龍是一個文化、旅遊及展覽的地點，希望大家稍後跑步時能夠領略到整段工程項目的幾個特色：包括「上天」的天橋、「下海」的海底隧道、「落地」的鑽探地底隧道，可讓大家看到隧道結構有不同分別。自二○一七年起工程開始建造，至今除了要建造項目本身之外，還要貫穿油麻地、佐敦、九龍灣及啟德的地段。大家都可以理解，附近有很多民居，特別我們要拆卸「汽車瓹山窿」的停車場，亦要重置油麻地玉器市場、公共圖書館以及母嬰健康院等。當中經歷了多達2 400次的地底爆破，但附近的民居卻不會受到影響，因為整個團隊利用謹慎和創新的工程方法，令每一次爆破可以在安全的情況下進行。另外，我們還創了一個紀錄，剛才KK（香港房屋協會主席凌嘉勤教授）也跟我說，他最初找這條走線極不容易，因為要在鬧市、有如此多公共設施下，能夠找到一條走線並橫跨了七條港鐵線，可見工程十分浩大及創新。我們希望可以利用基建項目，推崇大家投入運動及賽跑 。

繼今次籌備中九龍繞道（油麻地段）的「街馬」，希望明年更加努力，因我們正繼續努力興建茶果嶺隧道，是整個T2主幹路及六號幹線的重要一環，期望明年我們可以繼續和「全城街馬」合作。而今日則是中九龍繞道（油麻地段）開始公眾參與的揭幕，氣氛很好。

除此之外，立法會選舉亦踏入最後兩星期的衝刺階段。今日看到很多路政署團隊，相關部門包括消防處、土木工程拓展署，另外亦有顧問公司、工程師和營辦商代表，大家集結於此，正是一個很好的日子讓我們熱身，繼續推動全城氣氛以投入選舉。興建一個這麼大型的基建，需要得到立法會的撥款，與立法會建立互動關係非常重要。透過立法會選舉，我們希望能夠推動經濟發展、改善民生，為香港建立一個更美好的未來。1207（十二月七日），齊投票！多謝大家。"
