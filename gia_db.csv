  A spokesman for the LD said today (July 20) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

勞工處發言人今日（七月二十日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

勞工處發言人表示：「在擬訂及執行有關安排時，除考慮機構運作需要等因素，僱主應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法，例如容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應就他們的交通、安全、膳食、休息地點等作好安排。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

LD urges employers and employees to make work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-07-19 22:24,2025-07-19 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/19/P2025071900806.htm,"  As Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) will soon be in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (July 19) reminded employers to make work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable).
  
  An LD spokesman said, ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, apart from factors such as operational needs of establishments, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs. For example, employers may permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work.""
  
  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner, or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.
  
  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should work out arrangements for their transportation, safety, meals, rest places and more. If public transport services are suspended or limited when there is a T8 signal or higher, or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees.

The youth exchange programme, titled “Together, We Fight Against Drugs”, aimed to provide participants with insights into the Mainland’s drug prevention culture and publicity initiatives, equipping them to disseminate anti-drug messages more effectively in schools and the community in the future.
 
Led by the Chief Superintendent of Police Narcotics Bureau, Mr Ng Kwok-cheung, the Principal President of L.I.O.N., Mr Kerry Wong, and the President, Mr Godfrey Ngai, the delegation visited the Shenzhen Junior Police Camp under the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau. They engaged with the Mainland youth “Anti-drug Pioneers”, discussing future collaborative efforts between the two places, and topics such as “space oil drug”.
 
The mentees also toured biotechnology and low-altitude economy industry facilities in Shenzhen, where they participated in genetics experiments and gained knowledge about how drone systems integrate with smart city development. These activities deepened their understanding of the country’s innovation and technology development, as well as the application of these technologies in combating drug abuse.

The “Together, We Fight Against Drugs” Shenzhen-Hong Kong exchange programme has been organised by L.I.O.N. for three consecutive years, in partnership with the Narcotics Control Department of the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Hong Kong Shenzhen Youth Association, demonstrating both sides’ commitment to promoting youth drug prevention initiatives.

Established in 2021, L.I.O.N. recruits 100 secondary school students and undergraduates annually. Through drug knowledge workshops, leadership training camps, visits, as well as Mainland and overseas exchange programmes, it nurtures young leaders who promote drug awareness and prevention in the community and schools."

The competition attracted 40 secondary school teams from Hong Kong and Macao, providing students with the opportunity to propose innovative solutions for the future development of the logistics industry in three specific themes, namely smart city logistics, sustainable logistics and Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) as well as entrepreneurship and innovation in logistics.

In the Action Plan on Modern Logistics Development promulgated in 2023, the TLB proposed to strengthen the promotion of the modern logistics industry with a view to enriching the younger generation's understanding of the latest developments in the logistics sector, thereby inspiring their interest in and attracting them to join the industry. This competition provides a platform for students to unleash their creativity on one hand and promotes the innovation of the industry on the other hand.

The participating teams showcased their solutions to the public and the professional judging panel via exhibitions at the Grand Hall of Hong Kong Science Park. The judging panel evaluated each team based on their understanding of industry development challenges, the feasibility and practicability of their proposed solutions, and so on. Gold, silver, bronze, and merit prizes, as well as an overall grand champion and Cathay Cargo merit prize were awarded to the winning teams to recognise their efforts and creativity.

At the award ceremony, the Under Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mr Liu Chun-san, pointed out that the logistics sector has been advancing towards smart development, digitalisation and modernisation. He expressed his trust that the competition helped students experience the professionalism, innovation and vitality of the modern logistics industry. He also encouraged students to participate in the Internship Scheme on Modern Logistics to gain personal exposure to the interesting work of the industry and understand its various opportunities for career development.

To better equip students for the competition, HAFFA arranged a series of logistics-related seminars, simulation and virtual-reality trainings, as well as workshops ahead of the event. Senior industry professionals were invited to share their knowledge and insights, with a view to helping students gain an understanding of the latest developments in the modern logistics industry.

The event was fully supported by the logistics sector and academia, demonstrating the collaborative effort across sectors to promote young talent development in the logistics industry.

記者：想看看你們剛巡視完覺得現在的防風準備如何？

民政青年及事務局局長：大家都知道，昨日（七月十八日）政務司司長已經召開了跨部門督導委員會會議，督導各個部門要為這次颱風做好所有準備工作。18區民政事務處和不同的部門都在各區做了各項防風的措施和準備。我現在身處的鯉魚門，以往都是水浸比較嚴重的地方，所以我們特別來看看預備工作。我們很感謝渠務署的同事在過去一段時間已經做了很多預防工作，包括長遠的硬件如設置臨時水泵，又或是短期的或颱風時會做的，如安裝擋水板或加裝臨時行人步道。其實這些工作在我們過去很多次的準備和演練已經有一套準備計劃。

這次是來看看計劃的預備情況。我看到各區都已做充足的準備，亦藉此機會提醒附近的居民留意。今晚民政事務處會開放各區臨時庇護中心，庇護中心會有我們的同事、關愛隊和區議員當值，協助有需要的市民。希望大家都可以發揮好鄰里守望相助的作用。

一方面，政府部門、民政事務總署及民政事務處一定會做好預防工作及協助有需要的居民，同時希望所有市民都可以發揮鄰里守望的精神，亦關心在家中附近的獨居長者或有需要的家庭，為他們提供支援，或在有需要時，通知關愛隊和區議員協助有需要的住戶。"

政府方面，各個部門包括民政事務處或渠務署的同事，一定在這段時間全程投入，還有我們的工作人員會在有需要和有關的區域當值，緊守崗位。我們也希望市民能夠發揮鄰里守望的精神，如果大家知道鄰近有長者、獨居長者或有需要的家庭，希望大家可以提供協助，或通知當區區議員和關愛隊，為這些有需要的市民提供服務。希望颱風對社會和市民的影響減到最低，讓大家可以在安全的環境度過颱風。謝謝。"
