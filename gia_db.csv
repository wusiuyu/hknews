Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-14 21:37,2025-12-14 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/14/P2025121400669.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

   For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.4 billion as of noon today (December 14). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.7 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

Medical support
--------------------

  To ensure the affected residents receive more comprehensive medical support, the Health Bureau (HHB) will launch freeChinese medicine (CM)consultation service starting tomorrow(December 15). Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) and the Chinese Medicine Unit of the HHB, 150 CM practitioners have participated in the free CM consultation services, covering more than 170 service points. Starting from tomorrow until February 28, 2026, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) can receive up to three free CM consultation services, including the provision of medication and related treatments based on their clinical needs, through the arrangement of the District Health Centres/ District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong. The scope of free CM consultation services covers health conditions that may arise after the fire, such as emotional changes, insomnia, palpitations; coughing, wheezing, dry throat, and itchy throat; physical weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, dyspepsia; as well as pain and musculoskeletal injuries.

  Meanwhile, PHC Commission has earlier announced the establishment of a free family doctor service scheme to support the affected residents. Serving as hubs, the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have arranged case managers to follow up on the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents comprehensively. Based on the situations of individual cases and the preferences of affected residents, case managers will pair them with private sector family doctors participating in the scheme or the Hospital Authority's Family Medicine Out-patient Services.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

   As of this morning, a total of 1 390 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 3 235 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS).

   Currently, there is still an abundant supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer term accommodation. The transitional housing and HKHS projects in different districts can altogether provide around 400 units at the moment. Besides, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide an immediate supply of around 800 units.

   In consideration of the extremely urgent situation of the residents affected by the fire incident, a special arrangement of a full rent exemption has been made earlier by the Housing Bureau to provide accommodation support to those affected residents moving into transitional housing or HKHS projects. In other words, if needed, the affected residents can stay for a longer period of time. The Government will continue to support the affected residents in terms of accommodation, and the residents in need do not have to worry about the relevant rental expenses or the duration of stay.

   In addition, staff from the operating organisations of transitional housing and HKHS, as well as volunteers have been working around the clock to furnish the units with essential supplies, striving to meet the needs of the residents. Taking Kai Fook Kui in Kai Tak as an example, each unit is equipped, upon move-in, with furniture and appliances such as bed frames, mattresses, cooking stoves and water heaters. Furthermore, thoughtful members of the community have donated toys and musical instruments for children and elderly in need, bringing them warmth and care.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 800 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, about 23 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue."

經濟及福利援助
——————

截至今日（十二月十四日）中午，政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」已收到的外界捐款約34億元，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，基金總額約為37億元，會用在協助居民重建家園，是長期和持續的支援。

醫療支援
————

為讓受影響居民得到更全面的醫療支援，醫務衞生局（醫衞局）將於明日（十二月十五日）起推出中醫義診服務。在基層醫療署和醫衞局中醫藥處統籌下，現時已有150名中醫師參與中醫義診服務，涵蓋超過170個服務點。宏福苑共八座樓宇的所有居民（包括外籍家庭傭工）可由明日起至二○二六年二月二十八日，經全港十八區地區康健中心／站（統稱康健中心）安排接受最多三次免費中醫診症服務，包括按病情需要提供藥物及相關的治療。中醫義診服務範圍涵蓋火災後可能出現的健康狀況，例如情緒變化、失眠、心悸；咳嗽氣喘、咽乾喉癢；身體虛弱、疲倦、食慾不振、消化不良；以及痛症和筋骨損傷等。

另外，基層醫療署早前公布，設立家庭醫生義診計劃支援受影響居民。全港十八區康健中心作為樞紐已安排個案經理，為受影響居民全面跟進他們的基層醫療需要，並按個案情況和受影響居民意願，配對私營醫療界別家庭醫生義診或醫院管理局家庭醫學門診服務。

Police National Security Department charges two men and arrests one woman,2025-12-14 18:03,2025-12-14 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/14/P2025121400522.htm," The National Security Department (NSD) of the Hong Kong Police Force arrested a 26-year-old woman on December 12 night for being suspected of committing the offence of “unlawful drilling” under Section 13 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, in connection with the enforcement operation conducted on December 11.

 Regarding the nine persons arrested earlier, NSD has laid charge against two of the men, aged 24 and 25, jointly with one count of ""conspiracy to commit subversion"". The case will be mentioned at the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts tomorrow (December 15) morning.

 The arrested woman and other arrestees were released on bail and are required to report back to the Police in mid-January 2026.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-14 17:30,2025-12-14 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/14/P2025121400465.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 14), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 79 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and the relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373). All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

 To ensure the affected residents receive more comprehensive medical support, free CM consultation services will be launched starting tomorrow. Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) and the Chinese Medicine Unit of the HHB, 150 CM practitioners have participated in the free CM consultation services, covering more than 170 service points. Starting from tomorrow until February 28, 2026, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) can receive up to three free CM consultation services, including the provision of medication and related treatments based on their clinical needs, through the arrangement of the District Health Centres/ District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong. The scope of free CM consultation services covers health conditions that may arise after the fire, such as emotional changes, insomnia, palpitations; coughing, wheezing, dry throat, and itchy throat; physical weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, dyspepsia; as well as pain and musculoskeletal injuries.

 Affected residents with medical needs can call the hotlines or visit any DHC in person to seek assistance, regardless of their current place of residence. Those who are registered DHC members may also contact their respective DHC directly. The hotlines have been posted on the websites of the PHC Commission and the DHCs. Case managers of the DHCs will pair them with CM practitioners participating in the free CM consultation scheme based on their individual situation and preferences.

The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong

 All residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers), and all individuals injured in the fire and admitted to public hospitals under the Hospital Authority (HA) can receive full fee waivers at the Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) until December 31, 2026. The waivers cover all government-subsidised services of CMHHK, including General Clinic, Specialised Clinic, Allied Health Services, day-patient services, as well as special Western medicine diagnostic procedures and medications (discharge medication collection). Relevant individuals can identify themselves to CMHHK and provide basic personal information (including name, identity card number and residential address) during consultations to facilitate the arrangement.

Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres located in 18 districts

 Following the fire, the Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres (CMCTRs) under the HA promptly provide support in Sha Tin District, Tai Po District, and North District through enhancing CM services, arranging rescheduling of appointments, and re-dispensing of Chinese medicines.

 Starting from December 2, the 18 CMCTRs have been fully supporting all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers). They are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31 2026, covering government-subsidised CM outpatient services, including general consultation, acupuncture and bone-setting/tui-na. Relevant individuals can call the CMCTRs during their service hours or make an appointment via the ""18 CM Clinics"" mobile application. They shall identify themselves to the CMCTRs and provide basic personal information (including name, identity card number and residential address) upon registration to proceed with the arrangement. The CMCTRs will provide priority booking for the affected residents. In addition, the Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine Services under the HA's public hospitals/ambulatory care centres/out-patient clinics (currently available for six selected disease areas) will also waive service fees for relevant individuals.

 Information about the 18 CMCTRs can be found on the HACMK website.

 The HHB expresses gratitude to the CM sector and non-governmental organisations for their dedication to providing various CM support to the affected residents. The Government will continue to co-ordinate various medical services to support the physical and mental health needs of the residents."

十二月二十二日起實施車輛領牌新制度　加強規管長期未領牌車輛,2025-12-14 10:00,2025-12-14 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/14/P2025121200343.htm,"運輸署今日（十二月十四日）提醒登記車主，車輛登記及領牌新制度將於十二月二十二日（星期一）起實施，旨在加強規管長期未領牌的車輛，從源頭解決不當棄置車輛的問題。在新制度下，未領牌車輛將一直登記在車主名下，車主須為其車輛負上責任。

運輸署發言人說：「由十二月二十二日起，署方將向兩年或以上未領牌車輛的登記車主發出通知書，要求車主必須在發出通知書日期的三個月內為車輛領牌，或把車輛拆毀或永久送離香港後，將相關證明文件提交運輸署，並取消登記。車主須及時妥善處理車輛，以免觸犯法例。」

如車主在該三個月通知期屆滿前仍不作適當跟進，即屬犯罪。首次定罪最高可罰款10,000元和監禁三個月；其後每次定罪最高可罰款25,000元和監禁六個月。除非已繳付罰款，否則運輸署可根據法庭命令：（一）拒絕向被定罪車主發出或續發駕駛執照；（二）不處理涉事車輛及被定罪車主名下其他車輛的過戶通知；及（三）拒絕向涉事車輛及被定罪車主名下其他車輛發出車輛牌照。

個別車主如有實際困難而未能在三個月通知期屆滿前採取所需行動，或有合理理由不為其車輛領牌，可向運輸署申請豁免。一般而言，可獲豁免的車輛包括：（一）等待零件維修送驗後續牌的車輛；（二）車齡30年或以上、正妥善保存作私人收藏而不會在路上使用的車輛；或（三）妥善保存於車輛經銷商作寄賣的車輛。申請豁免的資格、指引、申請表及所需文件詳見運輸署網頁。署方會視乎個案情況考慮是否批准申請。

發言人提醒車主，即使未為車輛領牌或成功申請豁免，車輛仍會一直登記在其名下，車主須繼續承擔車輛引起的所有法律責任。車主可善用運輸署的「牌證易」網上平台，查閱名下車輛牌照屆滿日期、處理各類牌照事務及妥善處理名下未領牌車輛。

運輸署會繼續加強宣傳和公眾教育，透過網頁、海報、小冊子及Agent T Facebook專頁（www.facebook.com/AgentT.hk）持續提醒運輸業界和車主注意新法例要求。市民可參閱「車輛處理要及時」及「取消登記關我事」專題帖文，了解妥善處理車輛的要點，以及瀏覽運輸署網頁或致電熱線2804 2600了解詳情。"

New vehicle licensing regime to take effect from December 22 to strengthen regulation of prolonged unlicensed vehicles,2025-12-14 10:00,2025-12-14 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/14/P2025121200352.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (December 14) reminded registered vehicle owners that the new vehicle registration and licensing regime will take effect from December 22 (Monday), with a view to strengthening the regulation of prolonged unlicensed vehicles and addressing the improper abandoning of vehicles at source. Under the new regime, unlicensed vehicles will remain registered under the name of their owners, who will continue to be held responsible for their vehicles.

 A spokesman for the TD said, ""Starting from December 22, we will issue a notice to registered owners of vehicles unlicensed for two years or more. Vehicle owners must, within three months of the date of notice, renew the licence, or submit the relevant supporting documents to the TD and cancel the registration of such vehicles after scrapping them or permanently shipping them out of Hong Kong. They should handle their vehicles properly and in a timely manner to avoid contravening the law.""

  Failing to take the appropriate action upon expiry of the three-month notice period will constitute an offence. The maximum penalty for the first conviction will be a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months. For each subsequent conviction, the maximum penalty will be a $25,000 fine and six months' imprisonment. Unless the fine is paid, the TD may, subject to the court's order, (1) refuse to issue or renew the driving licence of a convicted vehicle owner; (2) cease processing any application for transfer of ownership of the subject vehicle and any other vehicles under the convicted owner's name; and (3) refuse to issue a vehicle licence to the subject vehicle and any other vehicles under the convicted owner's name.

  Individual vehicle owners who have a genuine difficulty in taking the required actions within the three-month notice period or have reasonable grounds for not licensing their vehicles may apply for an exemption from the TD. In general, exemptions may be granted for: (1) vehicles pending spare parts for maintenance and examination before licence renewal; (2) vehicles manufactured for 30 years or more, properly stored as a private collection and not used on roads; or (3) vehicles properly stored by a car dealer and consigned for sale. Details of the eligibility criteria, guidelines, application form and documents required are available on the TD's website. The TD will consider granting an exemption based on individual cases.

  The spokesman reminded vehicle owners that, even when a vehicle remains unlicensed or is granted an exemption, it will remain registered under their name and they have to continue to bear all legal liabilities associated with it. They may make use of the e-Licensing Portal to check the vehicle licence expiry date, handle licensing matters and take proper action on their unlicensed vehicles.

  The TD will continue to step up publicity and public education via the website, posters, pamphlets, the Agent T Facebook page (www.facebook.com/AgentT.hk) to remind transport trades and vehicle owners to take note of the new legal requirements. Members of the public may refer to the thematic posts for key points on handling vehicles in a timely manner and steps to cancel vehicle registration (Chinese only) to handle vehicles properly, visit the TD's website or call the hotline at 2804 2600 for details."
