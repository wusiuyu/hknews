Hong Kong Customs detects drug trafficking case involving passenger at airport (with photo),2025-08-23 16:57,2025-08-23 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/23/P2025082300593.htm,"âHong Kong Customs yesterday (August 22) detected a drug trafficking case involving a passenger at Hong Kong International Airport and seized about 12 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $2.7 million.

The case involved a male passenger, aged 26, who arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 12kg of suspected cannabis buds concealed by vacuum-sealed bags in his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

After a follow-up investigation, the arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug and he will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on August 25.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

案件涉及一名二十六歲的男旅客，他昨日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在他的寄艙行李內發現重約十二公斤、藏於真空包裝袋內的懷疑大麻花。該名男子隨即被捕。

跟進調查後，被捕男子已被控一項販運危險藥物罪，將於八月二十五日在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑販毒活動。"

大家好！今天很高興來到西九文化區，參與由青途發展社區發展協會舉辦的「全民體驗．躍動全運」活動。

今年十一月和十二月，我們將分別迎來第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會。這屆全運會首次由粵港澳三地共同承辦，我們深感光榮，同時亦感責任重大。我們會把握好這次機會，向全國以至世界各地展示香港籌辦大型體育賽事的能力，深化粵港澳大灣區體育及各方面的合作交流，共建一流灣區。

今日的活動以全運會為主軸，精心設計了多個互動體驗區。大家不僅可以親身體驗香港賽區的比賽項目，更可以與我們的精英運動員面對面交流，感受運動員在訓練場上的汗水與堅持、比賽中的全力拼搏。我們希望透過這些活動，燃點市民對體育運動的熱情，攜手迎接全運會的來臨。

香港賽區的各項籌備工作正進行得如火如荼。全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室早前已順利完成了香港賽區承辦的八個競賽項目和協辦的兩個跨境項目的測試賽。我們貫徹「簡約、安全、精彩」的辦賽原則，充分利用現有場館，包括今年開幕啓用的啟德體育園，加上中環海濱、維多利亞公園等場地，展現香港「盛事之都」的魅力和活力。

現時距離全運會開幕只有78天，標誌着這項全國體育盛事已進入最後籌備階段。啟德體育園由昨天起一連三日，率先舉行香港賽區首項全運會賽事—群眾賽事活動保齡球，為香港賽區賽事打響頭炮。

辦好全運會和殘特奧會是香港特區今年的重要任務。在接下來的日子，我們會繼續秉持「綠色、共享、開放、廉潔」的辦賽理念，與廣東及澳門保持緊密協作，推進各項準備工作，並會積極透過多元化的宣傳活動，全面提升全運會和殘特奧會的熱度和參與度，營造全城喜迎全運的氛圍。

我期待與全港市民攜手支持，全城投入全運會這場體育盛會。每一位市民的熱情參與，都將為運動員帶來更大動力，助力香港特別行政區代表團在全運會中突破自我、勇創佳績！

最後，我祝「躍動全運」體驗巡禮圓滿成功，為今屆全運會注入更多活力！多謝大家！

Remarks by S for Health at media session on tele-medicine and tobacco control,2025-08-23 13:37,2025-08-23 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/23/P2025082300417.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, at a media session after attending a radio programme this morning (August 23):

Reporter: Regarding the Consumer Council's report on tele-health, is the current mechanism in regulating medical staff enough in terms of protecting patients seeking such services and what should patients also be aware of? Secondly, with the expansion of regulation towards more public areas on smoking that would start tomorrow, what does the government hope to achieve and what is expected in the next stage?

Secretary for Health: Regarding the Consumer Council's report on tele-medicine, tele-medicine involves not only patient consultation but also communication between professional bodies and also education training etc. Focusing on the issue of patients' consultation via electronic media or even online, I would like to highlight the importance of the quality and safety in healthcare services. Tele-medicine is medicine, and a tele-consultation is a medical consultation. So, I would like to remind our citizens that when they have a health issue and want to seek healthcare advice, they should ensure that whether they see the doctor personally in person or via electronic media, they have to ensure that the person concerned is a qualified registered practitioner, whether is a Western medicine doctor or a Chinese medicine practitioner. In Hong Kong, we have measures and legislations that regulate the provision of healthcare services; and relevant professional bodies and councils have already issued guidelines to ensure that the practice of medicine via electronic means will follow the guidelines and ensure that patient safety and quality will be safeguarded. 

About tobacco control, we have put in the bill to Legislative Council for amending the tobacco control ordinance and we are going to have the second and third reading in September. We are confident that we will have the support from the Legislative Council. The whole exercise of the amendment actually started almost two years ago in 2023 when we started the public consultation and we had overwhelming support from the whole city. Over 90 per cent of the respondents supported more measures to control and reduce our smoking rate, so as to ensure the health of our citizens. Over the last two years, we have also heard the opinion from various stakeholders and made appropriate amendments, in order to ensure that all these measures will be safely and effectively implemented. The more important thing is about flavoured tobacco products—we will start with the non-mint flavoured tobacco, and we will put in all these measures in a timely manner.

 The Secretary for Housing, Ms ‍Winnie Ho; the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun; the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law; the Permanent Secretary for Housing/Director of Housing, Miss Charmaine Lee; the Director of Home Affairs, Ms Priscilla To; the Director of Social Welfare, Mr Edward To; and the Acting Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Miss Eve Tam, also joined relevant parts of the visit.

 Mr Lee and the officials, accompanied by the District Officer (Kwun Tong), Mr Denny Ho, first visited the Choi Hing Road project to learn about its operation and intake progress. He visited a household that had already moved in and listened to their sharing about life changes before and after relocation. He also toured a new home with a household that had just completed the intake procedures. Additionally, he inspected the project facilities to learn about the application of technology in property management and the nearby transport facilities. He also visited the weekend bazaar booths, interacting with residents and listening to their views on government policies.

 Mr Lee said that housing is the top priority of the current-term Government, which is expediting the speed and efficiency of increasing the public housing supply and has innovatively introduced Light Public Housing (LPH). He pointed out that LPH adopts a Modular Integrated Construction approach for expeditious building. Construction works of all the 13 projects have gradually commenced, with the first two projects at Yau Pok Road and Choi Hing Road having commenced intake. The first phase of the 18-storey, elevator-equipped Choi Hing Road project was completed in less than one and a half years, breaking the record for rapid construction of high-rise buildings in Hong Kong. He was pleased to learn that the residents reflected a significant improvement in their living environment compared to subdivided flats, and he looks forward to the completion of more projects so that more members of the public with urgent housing needs could be allocated to adequate housing as soon as possible to improve their quality of life.

 Mr Lee and the officials then arrived at Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate. Accompanied by representatives from the District Services and Community Care Team (Care Team) (Kwun Tong) and Kwun Tong District Council members, he visited service booths set up by the Care Teams in the Estate to learn about the health checks, free Chinese medicine consultations, and anti-mosquito campaign services offered to residents. During the visit, Mr Lee interacted with members of the public on-site and listened to their views.

ããMr Lee and the officials then visited the EKCC to inspect its facilities and learn about its efforts in promoting long-running performances and arts technology. He highlighted that the EKCC is a new and world-class major performance venue, expected to be in full operation by the end of this year. It will foster the curation of more signature performing arts programmes, promoting the industrialisation and integration of cultural tourism development, and establishing Hong Kong as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchanges.

ããMr Lee remarked that he attaches importance to various policy areas such as housing, people's livelihoods, and culture. He could better understand the needs and expectations of members of the public through direct engagement, which inspired him during the preparation for the Policy Address. He and his team will continue to visit different districts to listen to and consider opinions from various sectors of society, work tirelessly to pursue development and economic growth, and improve people's livelihood.

ããThe public consultation exercise for the 2025 Policy Address was launched in mid-June. Mr Lee appealed to members of the public to actively give their views on issues of their interest to the Government."

醫務衞生局局長會見傳媒談遙距醫療、控煙和建設新醫學院,2025-08-23 12:42,2025-08-23 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/23/P2025082300377.htm,"​以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（八月二十三日）上午出席電台節目後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：請問遙距醫療方面，現時政府規管是否足夠，發現最主要的問題出自哪裏，以及有何忠告﹖

醫務衞生局局長：我要強調，遙距醫療都是醫療，我們的規管是從醫療角度，不要將遙距醫療視為一種新的商業產品，由一些非醫護人員提供，這是很重要的一點。所有規管方面，現有香港法律其實對專業人員都有很嚴謹的規管，香港亦有委員會及管理局對不同的醫療專業作出規管，我們的香港醫務委員會和香港中醫藥管理委員會都分別向西醫和中醫發出遙距醫療服務指引。市民要明白遙距醫療是醫療服務的一種，不要隨便在網上或其他途徑相信一些非由醫療專業人員提供的所謂遙距醫療服務。這些如果牽涉到非法行醫的行為，我們會嚴肅跟進。另一方面，我們的專業人員包括西醫和中醫，他們會根據各自的委員會和管理局所作的指引，確保遙距醫療不會因遙距過程影響醫療質量安全，西醫和中醫都會明白如何去執行，如果他們不跟隨，各自的委員會和管理局會作出適當處理。

記者：有否留意新冠後遙距醫療較為普遍，亦引起關注；另外，甚麼情況下遙距醫療你覺得可行﹖

醫務衞生局局長：事實上新冠疫情是一個很特殊的情況，當時大量病人是單一病種，加上避免交叉感染，遙距醫療發揮了很大的作用。新冠疫情之後，市民和醫療界其實對遙距醫療都有一定的發展，舉例醫管局都有提供醫療服務，但是考慮到質量安全，主要都是用於覆診的病人、有特定的需要，以及其病情已經有了診斷，多數是覆診或者是會診，即醫生與醫生之間的溝通，而為病人提供的服務。第一次的診症以遙距醫療去做，會有一定的難度，亦未必符合香港醫務委員會或香港中醫藥管理委員會提出的要求，其中一個很明顯的例子，就是遙距醫療沒有辦法做身體檢查，這對無論西醫或中醫，都在診斷方面構成了困難，如果沒有真正為病人做身體檢查而作出診斷會不符合指引。

記者：「控煙十招」方面，下月會二讀，你是否有信心﹖最新的修訂是甚麼﹖未來本港禁煙區有否需要再擴大﹖

醫務衞生局局長：「控煙十招」其實由二○二三的公眾諮詢到現在都已經有兩年時間，在中間過程由提出「十招」，我們都聽到意見，作了一定的修訂，其中我們會維持循序漸進的原則，確保在考慮控煙效果的同時，亦明白對社會的影響和執行的細節，我們都會考慮，所以在修訂方面，例如我們重視打擊私煙的方法、完稅煙標籤的落實，以至提升罰則都是我們首要會做的。至於在管控加味煙方面，我們都會以循序漸進的原則，先管控非薄荷加味煙，在考慮管控加味煙入口時，合格證明書和如何判斷含有的添加劑，我們要確保是可以執行的。考慮很多的建議後，我們現在採用跟加拿大立法框架基本上是一致的，而加拿大在二○○九年已經開始管控加味煙，已經將包括薄荷煙在內作管控。我們現在修改法例管控加味煙，第一步是先管控非薄荷加味煙，所以我們可以這樣說，相比加拿大的法律框架，我們還稍微先寬鬆一點，確保能夠執行，我們才會考慮下一步何時去管控薄荷煙。

至於你提到禁煙的區域和範圍，就着「火車頭」邊行邊吸的行為，我們考慮到香港的環境比較擠迫，很難去定義在「移動」還是「停站」，所以我們認為在執行方面一個比較好、較實際的措施就是擴大某一些有高危人士的範圍，包括一些指定處所門口的三米範圍，以至排隊時候吸煙，這會更容易執法。而下一步我們也會考慮擴大現時禁煙區的範圍，包括一些特別高危，例如學校區或者特別多行人的指定區域，從而令控煙工作可以落實執行。

記者：有關第三間醫學院的發展，你剛剛也有提到，他們提出的方案或金額的差異都大，可否透露一下﹖

醫務衞生局局長：其實第三間醫學院對香港的教育、培訓和科研，特別在醫療服務方面是非常重要的。香港的醫療質量一向在世界上享負盛名，這跟兩間醫學院的培訓質量非常有關係，我們很期待如果有第三間醫學院可以進一步提升質量，甚至在科研創新方面都可以有很大發展。我們一定要確保第三間醫學院的質量，所以這次工作組做了很細緻的評核，對三間大學提出的方案，特別是建議的培訓課程，以至他們能否得到香港醫務委員會將來的認可，是一個很重要的考慮因素。同時，第三間醫學院亦會牽涉到較大的資金投資，特別是其財政可持續性，我們要仔細評核，三間大學提出的建議我們都已經進行兩輪會面，分析他們提出的方案，現在去到一個階段是看他們的資金和財政方面的安排，其實有差異是好的，正正就是因為三間大學有各自的優勢，而他們提出的方案都有很多創新的地方，他們參考自己本身的優勢、優點和他們要處理的地方，提出的財政資金方面，都有很大的不同，正正就是有差異，我們才可以從中希望可以融合其優勢，有些方案可能要求資金比較低，也有些要求的資金可能比較高，我們會在這方面再作最後的判斷，更會跟三間大學，看看他們的方案會否有調整的空間，從而在財政方面的可持續性可以適合香港的需要。

CAS Deputy Commissioner (Development and Youth) and Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee for the Promotion of the Constitution and Hong Kong Basic Law, Dr Wong Kong-tin, was invited as the keynote speaker, and 100 cadets participated in the event.

  In his welcome speech, the Chief Staff Officer of the CAS, Mr Leung Kwun-hong, said that this year marks the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. To highlight the historical significance of this victory, the Cadet Corps organised today's event to allow members to reflect on the history of the war and honour the martyrs, enabling them to ""learn from the past and understand the future"", thereby cherishing peace even more.

  He said that the history of the war is a shared memory of the Chinese nation and serves as the best patriotic education material. The first Patriotism Education Base for Hong Kong and Macao Youth has recently been established in Beijing, marking a new milestone in patriotic education in Hong Kong. This has significant implications for deepening the understanding of the country among young people from Hong Kong and Macao and strengthening their patriotism. It encourages young people to reflect seriously on the fact that if the country is not secure, it is the common people who suffer, and only with a strong and prosperous nation can there be peace and happiness today.

  In addition, Dr Wong discussed how the Chinese nation united in the face of adversity during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, transforming and advancing the process of national modernisation amid suffering.

  The CAS Cadet Corps organised and participated in nine exchange programmes this year in Mainland China and overseas, with over 150 cadets involved, including Shandong Chinese Cultural and Sports Industry Exchange 2025, Sichuan Ancient and Modern Technology Tour 2025, and Economic and Cultural Visit to Malaysia, among others.

  During the sharing session, the cadets who participated in the exchange activities said that visiting historical sites and modern constructions of the country and engaging in face-to-face interactions with local people allowed them to gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the growth of their country and boost their national pride. This enhanced their sense of national identity and significantly broadened their knowledge horizons.

Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, on August 22 (New York time).

  Performing to a sold-out crowd, the company impressed the audience with lush choreography, poignant storytelling and striking stage designthat blended Chinese tradition with contemporary ballet aesthetics. The performance also marked the triumphant return of the Hong Kong Ballet to the New York stage since 2023.

  The Director of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in New York (New York ETO), Ms Maisie Ho, warmly welcomed the Hong Kong Ballet back to New York City at the opening night reception.

  ""With this reimagined 'The Butterfly Lovers', the Hong Kong Ballet is pushing boundaries, boldly blending Chinese dance with the classical ballet art form,” she said. “This spirit of innovation and artistic growth, with a company of dancers from Hong Kong and abroad, also reflects Hong Kong's vibrant cosmopolitan lifestyle, global outlook, and rich cultural diversity.""

  Ms Ho highlighted Hong Kong's thriving arts and cultural landscape, bolstered by strong government support and initiatives that foster artistic excellence and cultural exchange. She noted that the Hong Kong Ballet exemplifies the vital role Hong Kong plays as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, grounded in the city's deep-rooted cultural heritage shared with Mainland China and long-standing global ties, including those with the United States.

  Led by the Hong Kong Ballet's Artistic Director, Septime Webre, this reimagination of the classic folktale weaves together classical ballet and traditional Chinese dance. Choreographed by Ricky Hu and Mai Jingwen, the production features breathtaking set and costume designs from Academy Award winner Tim Yip, and a sweeping original score performed live by the New York City Ballet Orchestra, conducted by the resident conductor of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra Lio Kuokman.

  ""The Butterfly Lovers"", co-presented by Hong Kong Ballet and the China Arts and Entertainment Group, continues its run at Lincoln Center this weekend (August 23 and 24, New York time), offering New Yorkers a rare opportunity to experience this cultural and artistic gem.

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-23 06:45,2025-08-23 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/23/P2025082200977.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 23) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

  This year marks the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. The HKSAR Government attaches great importance to the relevant commemorative activities. To honour the surviving veteran soldiers, veteran heroes, resistance commanders or their descendants in Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government presented the commemorative medals awarded by the country to them today, with a view to promoting the spirit of resistance, deepen society's awareness in history and patriotic sentiment.

  The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, stated in his speech, ""The people of Hong Kong united with our compatriots in the motherland with unwavering determination and fearless of sacrifice, and actively devoted themselves to the frontline of the resistance war to defend our homeland. Among them, many Hong Kong citizens joined the East River Column and Hong Kong-Kowloon Brigade. Each member fought bravely against our enemies, engaged fully in guerrilla warfare, and rescued trapped cultural figures and allied members repeatedly, demonstrating a firm and unyielding patriotic spirit.

  ""Only by knowing our history and loving our country, could the flame of patriotism be passed on. Only by remembering history can we create the future. The spirit of resistance of the sons and daughters of China is a precious spiritual treasure of our nation. It is also a powerful force that inspires us to keep moving forward. To commemorate the 80th Anniversary of the Victory of the War of Resistance, the HKSAR Government is uniting all sectors to hold a series of activities, enabling all citizens of Hong Kong, especially the younger generation, to strengthen and cultivate their unyielding patriotism and profound love for the nation"".

  Attendees of the ceremony, including veterans and their families, expressed their unrivalled honour in receiving the commemorative medals. The veterans who received the medals said the medals symbolised the nation's profound respect for their contributions to our history.

  The HKSAR Government is organising a series of commemorative activities, including an official ceremony on September 3 to commemorate the Victory Day of Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression at the Hong Kong City Hall Memorial garden, thematic exhibitions jointly organised by the Hong Kong Museum of History and the Hong Kong Museum of War of Resistance and Coastal Defence with the National Museum of China and Guangdong Museum of Revolutionary History, as well as a series of educational activities and anti-Japanese war film screenings targeted at the public and youth.

大家晚上好！我很高興出席今晚的典禮，與各位一起祝賀香港福建社團聯會第十四屆會董履新。我首先代表香港特區政府，熱烈歡迎周祖翼書記親自率領福建省代表團來香港。歡迎周書記！

習近平主席去年在福建考察時，肯定福建各項工作取得的成績，勉勵福建穩步推進制度型開放，對接國際高標準深耕細作，為擴大高水平對外開放再立新功。

福建是改革開放先行省份，在營商環境建設、重點領域改革攻堅克難。福建通過構建「一帶一路」立體互聯互通網絡、推進制度創新、拓展合作和加強交流，在「21世紀海上絲綢之路核心區」的建設上取得了顯著成效，為閩港合作提供堅實的基礎。

香港也一直全力發揮「一帶一路」功能平台的角色。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，是內地企業「走出去」和海外企業「引進來」的雙向跳板。不久之前，一家來自福建的新能源龍頭企業在香港新股上市，創下今年以來全球最大型的新股集資個案，正是反映了內地企業通過香港平台「走出去」所得到的增值能力。我相信，福建和香港優勢互補，一定會為國家新質生產力貢獻更多發展機遇。

閩港合作前景廣闊，而香港福建社團聯會一直擔當橋樑角色。聯會是閩港之間的重要紐帶，凝聚在港過百萬閩籍鄉親的強大力量，積極推動兩地人文交流。在座各位都是來自各行各業的精英翹楚，擁有豐富的社會經驗和廣泛的人脈資源。希望大家繼續努力，推動兩地在經濟貿易、文化藝術、創新科技等領域加強交流合作。

福建社團聯會扎根香港社會，服務社群。聯會一直支持特區政府，並參與政府設立的地區「關愛隊」工作，提供多元化地區支援服務，提升市民的獲得感和幸福感。聯會大力推廣家鄉文化，並積極舉辦內地交流活動，深化香港市民，特別是青年對福建的認識，增強他們的家國情懷，培育香港青年成為愛國愛港新一代。我肯定聯會對國家、對香港的貢獻。

今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，特區政府舉辦形式多樣的紀念和教育活動，包括大型的專題展覽、電影放映會、不同主題的抗戰歷史活動等。我相信聯會將繼續與政府攜手，動員市民投入活動，讓他們更深刻、更全面地認識抗戰歷史和抗戰勝利的重大意義，一同銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平、開創未來。

最後，我祝願香港福建社團聯會會務昌隆，新一屆會董工作順利，各位身體健康。謝謝大家！"

Update on mosquito-borne diseases,2025-08-22 19:02,2025-08-22 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200717.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 22), no new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

There have been no new cases of CF in the past week in Hong Kong. So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of nine confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. All cases have recovered and been discharged without complications. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually. 

For dengue fever (DF), there have been no new cases in the past week in Hong Kong either. There have been 41 imported DF cases recorded so far this year.A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

For Japanese encephalitis (JE), Hong Kong has recorded one imported JE case fromthe Philippines this year. In the past five years (from 2020 to 2024), no JE cases were recorded in Hong Kong, and a total of 10 cases were recorded between 2016 and 2019 (including six locally infected cases).

""The current high temperatures and rainfall levels continue to pose risks of transmission of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong. Aedes albopictus, which is the vector for chikungunya virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, is common in Hong Kong. Although these mosquito-borne diseases are not transmitted from person to person, during the early stage after the onset of symptoms (especially when a fever is present), the blood of infected patients contains a large amount of virus, which is infectious to mosquitoes. If people are bitten by mosquitoes during the communicable period, further local transmission via mosquitoes is possible,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

""JE is prevalent in rural areas of Asia and the Western Pacific Region, especially in the hot season. As Culexmosquitoes (including Culex tritaeniorhynchus), the primary vector for JE, can be found in Hong Kong, especially in the rural areas, there is also a risk of transmission of JE locally. Culexmosquitoes breed in areas where there is a lot of stagnant water, and pigs or wild birds are natural hosts of the JE virus. Culexmosquitoes become infected when they bite pigs or wild birds infected with the JE virus.The infected mosquitoes then transmit the virus to humans and animals during biting.Therefore, members of the public should take proper mosquito control measures both locally and during travel. We must make a concerted effort in eliminating mosquito breeding, so as to cut the transmission links of mosquito-borne diseases in the community,"" Dr Tsui added.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the CF patients, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspectionof the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on mosquito-borne diseases prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Besides, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of the mosquito-borne diseases.

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that those returning to Hong Kong from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should continue to apply insect repellent and closely monitor their personal health condition. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical attention immediately and inform their doctors of their travel history. The public should avoid using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), to prevent aggravating the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication.

Members of the public should also adopt anti-mosquito measures during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
蚊傳疾病最新情況,2025-08-22 18:30,2025-08-22 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200669.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月二十二日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

本港過去一星期沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案，今年累計錄得九宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案，全部個案已康復出院，沒有出現併發症。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

登革熱方面，本港過去一星期亦沒有新增個案，今年暫時錄得41宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

日本腦炎方面，本港今年錄得一宗從菲律賓輸入的日本腦炎個案。過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年），本港沒有錄得日本腦炎個案，而二○一六年至二○一九年共錄得十宗個案（當中包括六宗本地感染個案）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「現時溫度及雨量處於高水平，令多種蚊傳疾病在香港出現傳播的風險持續。可傳播基孔肯雅病毒、登革熱病毒及寨卡病毒的白紋伊蚊在本港很常見。雖然這些蚊傳疾病不會人傳人，但感染的病人在發病後初期（尤其是在發燒期間），血液會帶有大量病毒，對蚊子具傳染性。如在傳染期被蚊子叮咬，有機會透過蚊子在本地進一步傳播。」

他續說：「日本腦炎主要流行於亞洲及西太平洋地區的郊外及農村，尤其在氣候炎熱的季節。由於香港有傳播日本腦炎的主要病媒蚊庫蚊（包括三帶喙庫蚊），尤其是在郊區，因此本地亦存在傳播風險。庫蚊一般於有大量積水的地方繁殖，豬或野生雀鳥屬日本腦炎病毒的天然宿主，庫蚊叮咬帶病毒的豬或野生雀鳥後就會受感染，再於叮咬人類或動物時將病毒傳播。因此，市民無論在本港或外遊都應採取防蚊措施。大家亦必須齊心協助杜絕蚊患，方能截斷本地出現傳播蚊傳疾病的傳播鏈。」

繼續加強防控蚊傳疾病

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於基孔肯雅熱病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況。如出現不適，應立即求醫並告知外遊史，並應避免使用非類固醇消炎止痛藥（如布洛芬），以免加劇出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

在雨季期間，市民亦應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Through intelligence analysis and with the assistance of copyright owners, Customs earlier identified a number of party rooms suspected of possessing and providing infringing karaoke songs to customers in the course of business. Customs officers then took enforcement action and raided 40 party rooms in various districts, including Tuen Mun, Kwai Chung, Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwun Tong. A total of 40 sets of karaoke devices used for playing suspected infringing songs and a batch of audio and video equipment with a total estimated market value of about $1.24 million were seized. Four men and four women, involving seven persons-in-charge of the party rooms and one staff member, aged between 26 and 41, were arrested on suspicion of contravening the Copyright Ordinance. All arrested persons were released on bail pending investigation.The investigation is ongoing and further arrests are not ruled out.

During the investigation, Customs found 23 party rooms located in industrial buildings that were suspected of breaching the lease conditions and they have been referred to the Lands Department for further follow-up action.

Customs reminds business operators to comply with the Ordinance and to make enquiries tocopyright owners on matters relating to the use of musical visual recordings in the course of business.

Customs will continue to step up inspection and enforcement to vigorously combat different kinds of infringing activities to safeguard the rights of copyright owners.

Under the Ordinance, any person, who without the licence of the copyright owner of a copyright work, possesses infringing copies of a copyright work for the purpose of, or in the course of, any trade or business with a view to it being used by any person commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $50,000 per infringing copy and imprisonment for four years.

Buildings Department instigates prosecutions in relation to residential development project at Anderson Road,2025-08-22 18:12,2025-08-22 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200652.htm,"âA spokesman for the Buildings Department (BD) said today (August 22) that regarding the steel reinforcements of some structural elements in the superstructure works at a construction site at Anderson Road, Kwun Tong, which had not been installed in accordance with the requirements of the Buildings Ordinance (Chapter 123) (BO), the BD has initiated 205 prosecutions.

The spokesman said, ""The BD received a report in August last year alleging that the steel reinforcements of some structural elements in the superstructure works at a construction site at Anderson Road, Kwun Tong, had not been installed in accordance with the requirements of the BO. The site is related to a residential development involving six multi-storey towers. The BD subsequently served an order requiring the entire site to cease works, deployed its staff to carry out multiple site inspections and required the project's registered structural engineer (RSE) and registered general building contractor (RGBC) to open up the concrete at various locations in the superstructure of the six towers for investigation. The results revealed material deviations in part of the steel reinforcement installation from the approved plans in the six towers, including positional discrepancy and displacement of steel reinforcements, discrepancy in the size of steel reinforcements, fewer steel reinforcements than those shown in the approved plans, as well as misalignment of structural columns.""

  ""Based on the investigation findings, the BD found that the RGBCs and individuals directly concerned with the building works have violated the BO. After consultation with the Department of Justice, the BD has initiated 204 prosecutions under section 40(2A)(b) of the BO against the former and current RGBCs, the authorised signatories of the former and current RGBCs, and four technically competent persons directly concerned with the building works, involving a total of two companies and six individuals; and also one prosecution under section 40(2AB) of the BO against one of the technically competent persons concerned."" 

Although there is no obvious danger to the overall structure of the six buildings, the BD is closely following up with the project RSE on the incident report and the necessary remedial measures, including localised strengthening of the buildings, demolition of parts of the structural elements where necessary, and the reinstallation of steel reinforcements and recasting of concrete.

Pursuant to section 40(2A)(b) of the BO, any person for whom any prescribed inspection or building works or street works are being carried out and any authorised person, RSE, registered geotechnical engineer, registered inspector, qualified person, registered general building contractor, registered specialist contractor or registered minor works contractor directly concerned with any such inspection or works who diverges or deviates in any material way from any work shown in a plan approved by the Building Authority under the BO shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $1 million and imprisonment for three years.

Pursuant to section 40(2AB) of the BO, any person (whether or not an authorised person, a RSE, a registered geotechnical engineer, a registered general building contractor, a registered specialist contractor or a registered minor works contractor) directly concerned with any building works or street works set out in items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Column A in the table to section 17(1) who contravenes any condition imposed under that section in respect of such building works or street works, or the plans thereof, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for one year."

至於第七批公布的指數高於10%的包括葵青區青衣北及屯門區屯門西，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。其中，青衣北誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、公共屋邨及私人屋苑，該監察地區的誘蚊器指數由七月份的15.5%下跌至八月份由第一階段的12.7%，屯門西誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、學校及私人屋苑，該監察地區的誘蚊器指數由七月份的10.6%下跌至八月份的10.3%，各相關部門及持份者正積極跟進控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該兩個地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：
​

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Hong Kong Customs detects suspected gold-smuggling case by air worth about $22 million (with photo),2025-08-22 17:50,2025-08-22 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200289.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on August 13 detected a suspected gold-smuggling case by air freight, and seized about 26.2 kilograms of suspected gold with an estimated market value of about $22 million at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA).

Based on risk assessment, Customs on that day examined an air cargo consignment, declared as carrying plastic flower boxes departing for Japan, at the Customs Cargo Examination Compound at HKIA. Upon inspection, Customs officers found a batch of suspected gold, which had been moulded into thin sheets, concealed inside false compartments at the bottom of the flower boxes. The total weight of the suspected gold was about 26.2kg.

An investigation is still ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement actions against all kinds of smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

The FEHD has so far announced seven batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering 42 survey areas. Among these 42 survey areas, 26 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared with the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained at a low level. Eleven other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Among the seventh batch of indexes released, Tsing Yi North in Kwai Tsing District and Tuen Mun West in Tuen Mun District recorded an index over 10 per cent. In accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation that strengthens mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20 per cent or above, the FEHD is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. In particular, the gravidtrap data for Tsing Yi North showed that the areas with more mosquito problems included parks, public and private housing estates. The gravidtrap index for Tsing Yi North dropped from 15.5 per cent in July to 12.7 per cent in first phase in August. The gravidtrap data for Tuen Mun West showed that the areas with more mosquito problems included parks, schools and private housing estates. The gravidtrap index for Tuen Mun West dropped from 10.6 per cent in July to 10.3 per cent in August. The relevant departments and stakeholders are actively following up on the mosquito control work. Additionally, the FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap indexes in those two areas to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:


tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest Gravidtrap Index and the Density Index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
屋宇署就安達臣道住宅發展項目提出檢控,2025-08-22 17:46,2025-08-22 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200650.htm,"​屋宇署發言人今日（八月二十二日）表示，就觀塘安達臣道一個建築地盤的上蓋工程有部分結構的鋼筋未有依照《建築物條例》（第123章）（《條例》）標準安裝，署方提出合共205項檢控。

發言人表示：「屋宇署去年八月接獲舉報，表示觀塘安達臣道一個建築地盤上蓋工程有部分結構的鋼筋未有依照《條例》標準安裝。該地盤為住宅發展項目，包括六幢多層住宅大樓。其後署方勒令整個地盤停工和多次派員到地盤核查，並要求項目的註冊結構工程師及註冊承建商在六幢大樓上蓋工程的不同位置鑿開混凝土進行調查。結果顯示，六幢大樓均發現部分鋼筋配置嚴重偏離批准圖則的情況，包括一些鋼筋位置與圖則不符或移位、鋼筋粗幼與圖則不符、鋼筋數量比批准圖則少，以及結構柱移位等。」
