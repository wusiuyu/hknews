Housing Authority re-enters three construction sites,2025-07-02 12:55,2025-07-02 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200407.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Housing Authority:

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) today (July 2) re-entered the construction sites of three public housing projects in accordance with the notice of re-entry previously issued to Aggressive Construction Company Limited (ACCL), as ACCL had abandoned the contracts for the respective projects. The three construction projects are:


The underground link of Pak Tin Estate redevelopment Phase 10;
Public Housing Development at Tuen Mun Area 29 West (about 1 000 flats); and
Public Housing Development at Tung Chung Area 100 (about 5 200 flats).


  The Housing Department is now arranging for other qualified and capable contractor(s) to finish the remaining construction works in the hope that the affected projects can be completed as soon as practicable.

  The HA will continue to take various measures to expedite the completion of other public housing projects in order to reduce the impact as far as possible. On the other hand, as various Light Public Housing projects have been progressivelycompleted and are becoming available for allocation, the composite waiting time (CWT) will decrease steadily, and the target of reducing the CWT to 4.5 years in 2026/27 remains unchanged."
立法會三題：推動民宿發展,2025-07-02 12:35,2025-07-02 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200411.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上陳學鋒議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，今年五一黃金周僅約百分之六十六的內地旅客留港過夜，是與住宿費用昂貴及種類選擇較少有關，政府應善用鄉郊的天然資源發展民宿，以延長旅客留港日數。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據報日本近年放寬民宿規管，側重管理要求，而非如酒店及賓館般對其硬件設施實施嚴格規範，政府有否研究循此方向規管民宿；若有，詳情為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，香港有很多兼具天然美景及民宿發展潛力的鄉郊地點（例如貝澳及梅窩），政府會否研究讓位於該等地點並已獲發合約完成證明書（俗稱「滿意紙」）的村屋自動獲得民宿經營資格，以減省申辦民宿的行政程序；若會，時間表為何；及

（三）據報有位於鄉郊的私房菜館申請食肆牌照時遇到頗大困難，政府會否因應鄉郊特殊情況而放寬規定，並主動協助兼營食肆的鄉郊民宿統一辦理牌照，以加快民宿發展步伐？

答覆：

主席：

就陳學鋒議員三個部分的提問，經諮詢發展局和環境及生態局後，現綜合回覆如下：

民政事務總署轄下牌照事務處（牌照處）負責《旅館業條例》（第349章）（《條例》）的發牌及執法工作。《條例》的目的是確保擬用作酒店或賓館的處所，在樓宇及消防安全方面達到法定標準，以保障入住者及公眾的安全。此外，由於旅客通常都只在晚間或較少時間逗留在酒店或賓館，未必清楚有關處所的逃生路徑，因此有必要制訂合理程度的安全要求，以保障旅客的安全。現行制度下，任何提供短期收費住宿的處所，包括酒店、賓館或所謂「民宿」，都必須符合《條例》訂明的樓宇和消防安全標準，方能獲發牌照營業。《條例》並無針對「民宿」作出特別規限或排除，只要經營模式符合酒店或賓館的定義，無論是位於市區還是鄉郊，均可申領牌照經營。

牌照處一貫以靈活務實的態度，處理所有牌照申請，促進持牌處所的營運。在審批酒店及賓館牌照申請時，牌照處會確保申請處所達到基本安全要求，例如樓宇和消防安全，同時考慮該處所的規模和運作模式。此外，處所還需符合《條例》的相關規定，以保障入住者及公眾的安全，並兼顧處所所在大廈其他業主的權益。這些規定大部分是二○二○年修訂條例引入的規定，包括無使用限制規定，即申請牌照的處所所在大廈的公契中或地契中不可包含任何相關限制性條文；以及經營、開設或管理酒店或賓館的人士須為適當人選等，申請過程不會因屬「民宿」形式而加設額外限制。牌照處在收到牌照申請後，會派員到有關處所進行實地視察，根據個別處所的情況制訂適用的發牌要求。政府一直以保障公眾安全視為首要考慮，同時致力於促進業界的健康發展。在確保旅客、處於同一幢大廈內其他人士及公眾安全的前提下，牌照處會積極便利牌照申請和審批。

目前新界小型屋宇的土地契約一般容許非工業用途，即包括用作旅館用途，因此只要小型屋宇獲地政總署發出合約完成證明書（俗稱完工證）或不反對佔用書，不用再走程序去改契，但仍須申請旅館牌照方可營辦旅館，以保障入住者及公眾的安全。

然而，我們明白鄉郊地區的村屋有其獨特情況和限制。牌照處一向以靈活和務實的方式處理相關申請，並因應個別情況讓申請人提出替代方案，只要能確保樓宇及消防安全，便可獲批牌照。在不影響公眾安全的前提下，對於鄉郊和古舊村屋的申請，相關部門會因地制宜，協助申請人配合牌照要求。

截至二○二五年五月三十一日，本港已有108間位於新界或離島的鄉郊村屋獲牌照處發出賓館牌照。

事實上，為促進生態旅遊、利便訪客和協助活化荒僻村落，政府跨部門工作小組因應偏遠鄉郊地區的獨特性，為現時位於新界偏遠鄉郊、沒有車路連接的90多條鄉郊村落制訂一系列便利賓館及食物業牌照申領過程的優化措施，涵蓋城市規劃、土地、消防安全、樓宇安全及衞生方面等不同範疇。現時，已有位於荔枝窩的賓館、鹽田梓的外賣店和谷埔的餐廳，根據相關優化措施取得有關的牌照。政府正根據這些真實案例，梳理優化措施的要求、細節和執行步驟，並將匯編成一套《申請指引》，以供有意營運者參考。政府會持續檢視鄉郊地區賓館及食物業牌照申領過程的優化空間，為鄉郊地區締造更友善的營商環境，支持鄉郊保育和活化的工作。

在跨部門協作機制下，荔枝窩11間村屋已於二○二一年十二月至二○二二年九月期間成功獲發首批賓館牌照。

多謝主席。"
立法會二十二題：建設「無廢灣區」,2025-07-02 12:25,2025-07-02 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200374.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上陳月明議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉政府正與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）其他內地城市探討推進「無廢灣區」建設，而粵港兩地會以區域性策略處理廢物管理問題，透過優勢互補，加強推動大灣區可回收物料的區域性循環利用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）粵港政府於本年一月成立的「無廢灣區」建設專題小組的具體工作方向和策略，以及最新的工作進度為何；

（二）在「無廢灣區」的機遇下，政府將如何發揮香港內聯外通的優勢，促進發展大灣區綠色產業和循環經濟，以及有否評估當中可能出現的困難和挑戰；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）特區政府是否已開始探討跨境運送廢物往大灣區其他內地城市的安排，例如運輸方式（即海路或陸路）和每日處理量；如是，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆︰

主席︰

（一）根據國家生態環境部印發的《粵港澳大灣區生態環境保護規劃》，香港特別行政區政府與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市持續建設「無廢灣區」，探索「無廢城市」區域共建模式。粵港雙方已於今年一月舉行的粵港環保及應對氣候變化合作小組會議，成立「無廢灣區」建設專題小組（專題小組），作為兩地推進固體廢物管理與資源循環合作的固定機制，以加強政策對接、技術交流與專案協作，提升固體廢物協同處置能力。

專題小組已在今年三月二十七日召開首次會議，由香港特別行政區政府環境保護署與廣東省生態環境廳聯合主持，重點探討以區域優勢互補策略，推動大灣區可回收物料的資源化利用，並通過「項目化推進落實」模式深化合作，共同發展綠色產業和相關設施。目前，專題小組已就區域性資源循環合作、廢物管理政策等議題展開初步討論，並正積極商討推動兩地法規協調和市場對接。

（二）及（三）我們與大灣區內地城市的合作方向，是透過共同建設「無廢城市」推動將廢物轉為資源循環利用，而不是轉移都市固體廢物送往大灣區內地城市處理。

在專題小組的合作框架下，香港將充分發揮背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，進一步深化與其他大灣區內地城市在共同建設「無廢城市」和資源循環利用等領域的合作。一方面引入內地先進的回收處理技術與規模化產業經驗，另一方面結合香港國際化市場環境與成熟的環保管理體系，共同探索區域性循環經濟的發展路徑。例如，正在屯門環保園興建的紙漿生產設施和退役電動車電池回收設施，皆引進內地成熟技術處理本地廢紙和退役電動車電池，既提升香港在區域綠色產業鏈的角色，也促進大灣區綠色科技的協同發展和環保產業互利合作。

至於香港本地的都市固體廢物處理，特區政府正全力發展先進高效的現代轉廢為能設施網絡。第一座在石鼓洲旁建設中的現代垃圾焚化設施I∙PARK1將於今年內開始運作。此外，特區政府正全力推進發展I∙PARK2，工程項目已於去年十二月開展公開招標，並將於今年七月十八日截標，我們會適時就工程向立法會申請撥款。"

問題：

有意見認為上月舉行的首屆「香港非遺月」讓市民和旅客感受到香港非物質文化遺產（非遺）的活力和魅力，而非遺的技藝傳承，以及相關文創知識產權（IP）所帶來的經濟效益，均有助香港非遺的可持續發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）首屆香港非遺月各項活動的參與人數或人次，以及當中旅客的比例為何；有否評估香港非遺月的成效；

（二）據報政府將於今年內公布香港非遺傳承人認定制度，該制度會否涵蓋傳承人及傳承團體兩個類別的認定；會否設立傳承人取消機制，以令非遺歷久彌新，並保持傳承制度的活力及傳承人的積極性；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）據悉內地非遺IP快速發展並產生不少經濟效益，政府有何機制定期跟進、孵化、支援、保護和統計香港非遺所轉化成的文創IP項目，以使其可持續創造文化價值及經濟效益？

答覆：

主席：

非物質文化遺產（非遺）是中華優秀傳統文化的重要組成部分，是中華文明綿延傳承的生動見證。文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）及康樂及文化事務署（康文署）一直致力保護、傳承和推廣香港非遺，積極配合國家推進非遺保護的工作方針，推行加強保護非遺的措施，因應不同範疇的非遺項目深化在確認、立檔、研究、保存、推廣和傳承等多方面的工作，以提高公眾對非遺的認識，鼓勵社會共同參與保護非遺。有關工作包括康文署的非遺資助計劃，支持合資格的本地團體和個人推行具意義的本地非遺計劃。此外，康文署於二○二四年十二月公布更新的香港非遺代表作名錄及香港非遺清單，非遺代表作名錄項目由20個增至24個，非遺清單項目則由480個增至507個。

按二○二四年《施政報告》中提出的兩項推動非遺保護和傳承的措施，康文署轄下的非遺辦事處於二○二五年制定香港非遺代表作名錄項目傳承人的認定機制和準則，並於每年六月舉辦「香港非遺月」。

就吳議員問題的三個部分，我分別回覆如下：

（一）首屆「香港非遺月」於二○二五年五月三十一日至七月一日圓滿舉行，活動包括超過80場非遺表演、60個非遺互動體驗攤位和24個「非遺精華遊蹤」活動，涵蓋超過100項非遺項目。應康文署的邀請，超過20個社區團體參與籌辦當中的活動，增加「香港非遺月」在社會的覆蓋力和滲透力。

截至二○二五年六月二十一日，首屆「香港非遺月」的參與人次已超過八萬五千，預計總參與人次超過10萬。雖然沒有具體的旅客比例數字，但首屆「香港非遺月」的開幕禮及非遺嘉年華選擇在旅客眾多的尖沙咀香港文化中心露天廣場舉行，適逢內地端午節的長周末假期，吸引了不少旅客參與這場非遺嘉年華。其中「非遺精華遊蹤」約有三分一的名額給予境外旅客，旅客的反應非常正面，康文署日後會繼續在這方面作嘗試，加強文旅融合。各項活動的參與人次詳見我們提供的附件。

首屆「香港非遺月」成功凝聚社會對香港和內地非遺的認識，透過政府與民間組織的協作，以及本地和內地非遺團體及工作者的積極參與，讓市民及旅客感受到「香港處處有非遺」。

（二）康文署已研究了國家關於非遺代表性傳承人的認定與管理辦法，並完成蒐集和了解廣東省、澳門等鄰近地區在規劃、制定和執行認定傳承人或團體的相關資料，涵蓋當地的認定機制、管理制度及傳承人取消機制等。目前，國家的管理辦法有涵蓋取消機制，而廣東和澳門也有各自適用的取消機制。康文署會參考上述資料，並因應香港非遺傳承的實際狀況，擬備符合香港情況的方案，包括申請傳承人或團體要遵守的要求、認定機制和準則，以及適用的取消機制。康文署會就所草擬的方案諮詢非遺諮詢委員會的意見，確保訂定一套嚴謹和適用於香港情況的認定機制和準則，以有效認定高質素及致力傳承非遺的傳承人或團體，增強保護和傳承香港非遺。我們預期於今年內公布有關香港非遺傳承人的認定機制和準則。

（三）至於非遺文化IP（知識產權）方面，非遺辦事處近年積極協助本港文化及創意產業品牌，推出文藝創意商品。例如自二○二四年起與本地時裝品牌合作，讓香港非遺元素以嶄新的方式呈現，為時尚愛好者帶來一系列活化傳統的新派長衫，以及以非遺元素創作的服飾。除了在香港開展宣傳推廣，亦會透過在香港以外的地方，例如倫敦、上海及深圳，舉行時裝表演展示香港非遺。非遺辦事處會繼續為合適的文化及創意產業品牌，提供非遺資訊，協助他們將非遺活化為可增值的文創產品。

此外，文體旅局轄下文創產業發展處透過「創意智優計劃」資助及推動本地文創業界與非遺傳承人聯乘合作，在本地、內地及海外文創展覽或活動中推廣香港非遺，以及支援香港設計師以非遺為題材創作文創產品，宣傳香港非遺同時促進文創業界產業化發展。這些項目包括二○二四年十一月深圳讀書月及二○二五年四月香港悅讀周期間舉行「故宮館藏x香港非遺」展覽；二○二五年六月在北京國際圖書博覽會設立以「漫步香港：非遺與城市記憶」為主題的香港館；以及將於二○二五年十一月舉行的「香港原創潮玩展2025@吉隆坡」展出香港原創潮玩設計師，以香港非遺為題材創作的全新潮玩等。"
"LCQ22: Development of ""Zero Waste Bay Area""",2025-07-02 12:25,2025-07-02 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200375.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 It is learnt that the Government is exploring with other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to take forward the development of ""Zero Waste Bay Area"", and that Guangdongand Hong Kong will tackle waste management issues through regional strategies and enhance regional recycling of recyclable materials in the GBA by leveraging each other's competitive advantages and complementing strengths. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific work directions and strategies of the Special Panel for Building ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" established by the governments of Guangdongand Hong Kong in January this year, and the latest progress of its work;

(2) given the opportunities arising from the ""Zero Waste Bay Area"", how will the Government capitalise on Hong Kong's advantage of connecting the country with the world to facilitate the development of green industries and a circular economy in the GBA, and whether it has assessed the difficulties and challenges that may arise in the process; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the HKSAR Government has started to explore the arrangements for the cross-boundary transportation of waste to other Mainland cities in the GBA, such as the mode of transport (i.e. sea or land) and daily handling capacity; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

(1) According to the ""Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Ecological Environmental Protection Plan"" promulgated by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government continuously works with the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to develop a ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" and explore regional co-operation models for achieving ""Zero Waste City"". The Special Panel for Building ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" (the Special Panel) was established by Guangdong and Hong Kong at the Hong Kong-Guangdong Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection and Combating Climate Change meeting held in January this year, serving as a standing mechanism for advancing solid waste management and resources circulation co-operation between the two places, thereby strengthening policy co-ordination, technical exchanges and project collaboration, as well as elevating the capability in jointly handling solid waste.

 The first meeting of the Special Panel, held on March 27 this year, was co-chaired by the Environmental Protection Department of the HKSAR Government and the Department of Ecology and Environment of Guangdong Province. It mainly focused on exploring strategies leveraging on the complementary advantages of the region, to promote resources circulation of recyclable materials in the GBA and foster collaborative development of green industries and related facilities through deepening the collaboration by a joint ""project-based"" model. At present, the Special Panel has commenced initial discussions on topics such as regional co-operation in resources circulation and waste management policy, and is actively discussing how to promote the co-ordination of regulations and market integration between the two places.

(2) and (3) The co-operation direction with the Mainland cities of the GBA is to promote resources circulation through the joint development of ""Zero Waste City"", instead of transferring the municipal solid waste (MSW) to the Mainland cities of the GBA for treatment.

 Under the co-operation framework of the Special Panel, Hong Kong will fully capitalise on our distinctive advantage of having strong support of the Motherland and being closely connected to the world to further deepen the co-operation with other Mainland cities of the GBA in areas such as developing a ""Zero Waste City"" and promoting resources circulation. Hong Kong will introduce advanced recycling technologies and large-scale industrial expertise from the Mainland on one hand; and integrate its international market environment with its mature environmental management system to jointly explore the development pathway of a regional circular economy on the other. For example, the paper pulping facility and the retired electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling facility currently under construction in EcoPark, Tuen Mun, both incorporate mature Mainland technologies to process local waste paper and retired EV batteries. This not only strengthens Hong Kong's role in the regional green industry chain, but also fosters collaborative development of green technologies and mutually beneficial co-operation in the environmental industry of the GBA.

 As for the local treatment of MSW in Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government is pressing ahead with the development of a network of advanced and highly efficient modern waste-to-energy facilities. The first modern incineration facility for treating MSW currently under construction near Shek Kwu Chau, IâPARK1, will commence operation within this year. In addition, the HKSAR Government is pushing forward the development of IâPARK2 at full steam. The open tender for the project was invited in last December and will close on July 18 this year. We will seek funding from the Legislative Council for the project in a timely manner."
LCQ1: Sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage,2025-07-02 12:25,2025-07-02 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200331.htm,"  âFollowing is a question by the Hon Stanley Ng and a reply by the Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

  There are views that the first Hong Kong Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) Month held last month enabled members of the public and tourists to experience the vitality and charm of Hong Kong's ICH, and that transmitting ICH skills and the economic benefits brought about by the related cultural and creative intellectual property rights (IP) are conducive to the sustainable development of Hong Kong's ICH. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of participants or visitors to the various activities of the first Hong Kong ICH Month, and the proportion of travellers among them; whether an assessment has been conducted on the effectiveness of Hong Kong ICH Month;

(2) as it has been reported that the Government will announce a system for designating Hong Kong ICH bearers this year, whether the system will cover designation for both categories of bearer and bearer organisation; whether a mechanism will be established to revoke the status of bearers, ensuring that ICH remains vibrant and relevant over time, as well as maintaining the vitality of the transmission system and the enthusiasm of bearers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as it is learnt that the rapid development of IP of ICH in the Mainland has generated considerable economic benefits, of the mechanism put in place by the Government to regularly follow up on, incubate, support, protect and compile statistics on cultural and creative IP projects derived from Hong Kong's ICH, so that they can sustainably create cultural value and economic benefits?

Reply:

President,

  Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) is an essential part of the fine traditional Chinese culture, and a lively witness to the continuous transmission of Chinese culture. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) are committed to safeguarding, transmitting and promoting the ICH of Hong Kong, while actively supporting the national policies on furthering the safeguarding of ICH and implementing enhanced measures. Targeting ICH items across various domains, different aspects of work such as identification, documentation, research, preservation, promotion and transmission of ICH are strengthened to enhance the public's understanding of ICH and engage the community in safeguarding ICH. The above work includes the ICH Funding Scheme of the LCSD, which supports eligible local organisations and individuals in implementing meaningful local ICH projects. In addition, the LCSD released in December 2024 the updated Representative List of the ICH of Hong Kong (Representative List), with an increase in its number of items from 20 to 24, and the updated ICH Inventory of Hong Kong, with an increase in its number of items from 480 to 507.
  
  The 2024 Policy Address proposed two measures to promote the safeguarding and transmission of ICH, whereby the LCSD will develop a mechanism and criteria in 2025 for recognising the bearers of the items on the Representative List, as well as organise the Hong Kong ICH Month in June every year.
  
  In response to the Hon Stanley Ng's three-part question, my replies are as follows:

(1) The inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month was successfully held from May 31 to July 1, 2025. Activities include over 80 ICH performances, 60 interactive experiential booths on ICH and 24 field trips under ""ICH Highlight Tours"", covering more than 100 ICH items. By invitation of the LCSD, over 20 community organisations participated in organising activities during the Hong Kong ICH Month so as to expand the coverage of the event and extend its reach in the community.

  With the attendance of the activities of the inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month already surpassing 85 000 as at June 21, 2025, the final total attendance of the event is estimated to be more than 100 000. Despite the unavailability of figures on the percentage of visitors, since the tourist-filled Piazza of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui was chosen as the venue of the opening ceremony and the ensuing ICH carnival of the inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month, and both activities fell on the Mainland's long weekend holiday in celebration of the Tuen Ng Festival, many visitors were attracted to the ICH carnival. Among others, around one-third of the ""ICH Highlight Tours"" quotas were given to visitors, and their feedback was very positive. The LCSD will continue to make efforts in this area in the future to enhance the integration of culture and tourism. A breakdown of the attendance of the Hong Kong ICH Month 2025 by activity is set out at Annex.
  
  The inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month successfully enriched the public's understanding of the ICH items of both Hong Kong and the Mainland. Through the collaboration between the Government and community organisations, as well as the active participation of local and Mainland ICH organisations and practitioners, the public and visitors were provided with an experience of ""ICH Around Town"".

(2) The LCSD has studied the national guidelines for the recognition and management of ICH bearers. It has also completed its collection of and gained insight into relevant information on the planning, formulation and implementation of the mechanism for recognising ICH bearers or bearer organisations, the management system and the cancellation mechanism for the recognised ICH bearers or bearer organisations, etc in Guangdong Province, Macao and other neighbouring regions. Currently, the national guidelines include a cancellation mechanism, while Guangdong and Macao also have their own relevant cancellation mechanisms. The LCSD will take into account the aforementioned information and consider the current transmission of Hong Kong's ICH to prepare a proposal that is in accord with the actual situation of Hong Kong. The proposal will cover the requirements for applicants for the status of ICH bearer or bearer organisation to follow, the mechanism and criteria for recognition, as well as a cancellation mechanism where applicable. The LCSD will consult the ICH Advisory Committee on the draft proposal to ensure that a set of stringent recognition mechanism and criteria suitable for Hong Kong is formulated to effectively recognise high-quality bearers or bearer organisations that are committed to transmitting ICH, thereby enhancing the protection and transmission of Hong Kong's ICH. The mechanism and criteria are expected to be promulgated within this year.

(3) As regards intellectual property based on ICH, the ICH Office has actively assisted cultural and creative industry brands in Hong Kong in launching creative cultural merchandise in recent years. For example, it has co-operated with a local fashion brand since 2024 to present Hong Kong's ICH elements in a novel way to bring fashion lovers a series of new-style cheongsams that revitalise traditions, and clothing created with ICH elements. In addition to a publicity and promotional campaign launched in Hong Kong, fashion shows were organised in places outside of Hong Kong, such as London, Shanghai and Shenzhen, to showcase Hong Kong's ICH. The ICH Office will continue to provide information on ICH for suitable cultural and creative industry brands to assist them in transforming ICH into value-‍added cultural and creative products through revitalisation.

  Furthermore, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency under the CSTB, through the CreateSmart Initiative, provides funding support and drives to foster cross-sectoral collaboration between local cultural and creative industries and ICH bearers, promote Hong Kong's ICH at cultural and creative exhibitions and events staged in Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, and support Hong Kong designers to create cultural and creative products themed on ICH. These collaborations promote the ICH of Hong Kong, as well as facilitate the development of cultural and creative sectors as industries. Examples include the ""Palace Museum Collections x Hong Kong Intangible Cultural Heritage"" Exhibition held during the Shenzhen Reading Month in November 2024 and the Hong Kong Reading Week in April 2025, the Hong Kong Pavilion themed ""Strolling through Hong Kong: Intangible Cultural Heritage and Urban Memories"" set up at Beijing International Book Fair in June 2025, and the Hong Kong's ICH-themed new art toys created by Hong Kong original art toy designers to be showcased in the ""Hong Kong Art Toy Story 2025@Kuala Lumpur"" in November 2025."

胡文新主席（香港冰球訓練學校兼香港業餘冰球會主席）、朱劍平處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部體育處處長）、各位嘉賓、各位教練、各位冰球員、各位朋友：

大家早上好。很高興今日來到將軍澳這個冰場為全港十八區青少年冰球錦標賽主持開幕禮。

剛才看了一會比賽，我已經看見大家充滿朝氣與活力的年輕臉孔。冰球是一項講求節奏、速度和控球技巧的高強度運動。在冰面上高速滑行、傳球和射門，不但考驗球員的體能，還需要機智與判斷，電光火石之間就決定了勝負。

體育活動在社區的普及，實有賴各界鼎力支持和參與。全港青少年地區冰球發展計劃已推行接近二十年，與超過300多間學校合作，為約44 000多名青少年提供培訓。我衷心感謝香港冰球訓練學校與香港業餘冰球會的教練和團隊，本着他們自己對冰球運動的熱誠，不遺餘力推動這項運動，並成功培育了不少有潛質的青少年球員。

值得一提的是，過去一年，在Thomas（胡文新）的帶領下，香港冰球訓練學校與香港業餘冰球會為全港14個地區的學校籌組了17支青少年冰球隊，進行常規訓練，並協助當中五間學校在校內設立仿真溜冰場，其中一間學校更把冰球運動納入其校本體育本科。香港冰球訓練學校與香港業餘冰球會在推廣冰球運動方面的努力與建樹，大家有目共睹。

今日，來自不同地區的球員齊集在真雪溜冰場，互相較量，是展現辛苦訓練成果的好機會。我鼓勵大家全力以赴，盡情發揮，好好享受比賽的過程，並從中汲取經驗，不斷精益求精。

最後，我謹祝全港十八區青少年冰球錦標賽圓滿成功，各位球員有出色的發揮。多謝大家。"

（七）會否考慮設立密閉空間工作強制呈報機制，要求承建商在開展較高風險的密閉空間工程前須先呈報，以便當局安排針對性巡查，加強確保前線工友的工作安全？

答覆：

主席：

就周小松議員的提問，經諮詢渠務署後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（六）勞工處不時巡查全港工作場所，以保障工人工作時的安全及健康。由於巡查密閉空間工作是勞工處日常進行職安健巡查的一部分，因此勞工處沒有專就這類工作場所分項備存巡查地點和相關執法數字。然而，自二‍○二二年起，勞工處與主要負責渠務工程的政府部門和法定機構（包括渠務署、房屋署、路政署和香港機場管理局）建立通報機制，這些部門／機構會定期向勞工處通報需要工人進入密閉空間進行渠務或地底喉管工作的日期和時間，以便勞工處按風險為本策略，選擇有較高風險的密閉空間工作進行突擊巡查和加強執法。自通報機制建立至今年五月，勞工處共收到8 608次通報，並進行780次巡查。相關的通報和巡查數字載於附件一。

在突擊巡查密閉空間工作時，勞工處人員會檢視相關工序及設備，例如有否進行風險評估及有否執行相應的風險控制措施、工人是否符合培訓及相關工作經驗的要求、進行地底喉管工作的工人有否配戴認可的呼吸器具及適當的安全吊帶等。此外，自二○二四年十一月三十日修訂版《密閉空間工作的安全與健康工作守則》生效後，勞工處人員會特別留意東主或承建商有否按照守則採取相關措施，包括在工作期間於密閉空間的出入口拍攝視頻，加強保障工人的職安健。過去三年，勞工處就通報系統而進行的突擊巡查共向相關東主或承建商發出13份敦促改善通知書及136封警告信。這些違規事項主要涉及未有進行全面的風險評估、發出不完整的許可工作證明書及未有正確使用認可的呼吸器具等。相關的執法分項數字載於附件二。

（二）職安局於二○二二年六月推出「密閉空間安全工作資助計劃2.0」，資助中小企購買合適的安全設備，包括氣體測試設備及動態感應器，並免費提供相關的訓練課程及一站式風險評估。計劃旨在協助中小企提升密閉空間工作安全水平，特別是沙井、污水渠、喉管等工作環境，預防意外。該計劃的詳情及相關統計數字載於附件三。

（三）職安局於二○二二年推出「職安健星級企業—密閉空間安全認可計劃」，旨在為從事密閉空間工作（例如沙井、污水渠、壓力容器／鍋爐、隧道、喉管、水缸）的企業，提供度身訂做的免費職安健顧問服務、培訓課程及資助購買安全裝備，並為職安健表現達到一定水平的企業認證，致力協助業界提升工作安全健康水平，並協助業主或場地管理者識別職安健表現較佳的承辦商。企業成功通過職安局認證後會成為「密閉空間職安健星級企業」，可獲列入星級名冊讓用家識別。該計劃的相關統計數字載於附件四。

（四）勞工處高度關注二○二四年四月二十二日晚在沙田源禾路遊樂場發生涉及渠務工程的致命工作意外。勞工處已迅速完成調查，經徵詢律政司意見後，根據《工廠及工業經營條例》（第59章）及其附屬規例，向有關承建商及分判商提出共43項檢控，有關案件現已進入司法程序。

（五）在上述於沙田源禾遊樂場發生致命意外後，渠務署隨即停止所有清洗污水渠工作並詳細檢視有關的工作流程。渠務署分別於在二○二四年五月三十一日及六月二十八日更新其密閉空間工作相關的實務備考及合約條款，訂明工程如初時預計無須派員進入密閉空間（包括沙井）工作，但後來發現必須派員進入，承建商須立即暫停有關工程、通知渠務署，並按密閉空間工作守則，在完成風險評估和實施相關的安全措施及獲得渠務署批準後，才可進入該密閉空間工作。

（七）除上文所述勞工處與主要負責渠務工程的政府部門和法定機構建立的通報機制之外，勞工處亦已於二零二四年修訂《密閉空間工作的安全與健康工作守則》，並加強相關的宣傳及教育，提升業界的職安健意識。此外，按上述守則作出修訂的密閉空間作業強制性安全訓練課程亦已於二○二四年十一月三十日推行，進一步提升相關工作的安全水平。我們會繼續採取多管齊下的策略，加強巡查執法、宣傳推廣及教育培訓，預防意外發生。"
LCQ8: Safety and health at work in confined spaces,2025-07-02 11:36,2025-07-02 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200281.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chau Siu-chung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 Regarding safety and health at work in confined spaces, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Code of Practice for Safety and Health at Work in Confined Spaces (CoP) was revised last year by adding, among others, the requirement for proprietors or contractors to record videos at the entrance and exit of the confined spaces throughout the entire work period, of the number of work sites involving confined space operations that have been inspected since the revision of the CoP, and whether any violations of the CoP by proprietors or contractors have been identified during the inspections; if so, of the main nature of such violations, and the numbers of written warnings, suspension notices, and improvement notices issued in response to such violations, as well as the number of prosecutions initiated; among these prosecutions, of the number of convictions and the penalties imposed;

(2) given that the Occupational Safety and Health Council (OSHC) launches the ""OSH Enhancement Scheme for SMEs for Safe Work at Confined Space 2.0"" (Enhancement Scheme) to subsidise eligible small and medium enterprises for purchasing equipment such as gas detectors and man-down alarm devices, of the number of application quotas available under the Enhancement Scheme and the numbers of applications received, approved, and rejected by the OSHC in each of the past three years and this year to date, with a breakdown by nature of business of the enterprise (e.g. drainage services, construction, and mechanical and electrical engineering); of the average amount of subsidy for the approved applications (set out by new applicants and enterprises previously subsidised), and the main reasons for applications being rejected;

(3) given that the OSHC launches the OSH Star Enterprise - Confined Space Safety Accreditation Scheme (Accreditation Scheme) to provide enterprises specialising in confined space work with, among others, occupational safety and health (OSH) consultancy service and subsidies for purchasing safety equipment, of the numbers of enterprise applications received, approved, and currently under vetting by the OSHC under the Accreditation Scheme in each of the past three years and this year to date, with a breakdown by nature of business of the enterprise (e.g. drainage services, construction, and mechanical and electrical engineering); of the average amount of subsidy for the approved applications;

(4) of the progress of the investigation to identify the causes of the fatal industrial accident involving a manhole that occurred on Yuen Wo Road in Sha Tin on April 22 last year, and whether prosecution has been initiated against those held liable for the accident; if so, of the details;

(5) as it is reported that the authorities indicated last year that they would study the possibility of including clauses in sewer cleaning contracts to stipulate that if workers who are originally not supposed to enter a manhole subsequently need to do so, the Drainage Services Department must be informed and its approval had to be obtained in advance, of the progress made in this regard;

(6) given that according to a paper submitted by the Government to the Panel on Manpower of this Council in June 2022, the Labour Department (LD) has established a notification system with key government departments/statutory bodies responsible for drainage works (including the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the Housing Department, the Highways Department and the Drainage Services Department), under which these government departments/statutory bodies will notify the LD of the date and time of all their drainage works or underground pipeworks that require workers to enter confined spaces, so as to facilitate surprise inspections by the LD as appropriate according to a risk-based strategy, of the number of works notified by these government departments/statutory bodies in each year since the establishment of the notification system, and the number of these works that have been inspected by the LD, with a breakdown by the notifying government department/statutory body; during these inspections, whether there are any cases where contractors were found to have violated the CoP and/or relevant OSH legislation (including the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Confined Spaces) Regulation (Cap. 59AE), the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance (Cap. 59), and the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (Cap. 509)); if so, of the details, including the number of cases and their nature, as well as the follow-up actions taken, with a breakdown by the notifying government department/statutory body; and

(7) whether it will consider establishing a mandatory reporting mechanism for work in confined spaces, requiring contractors to report prior to commencing higher-risk work in confined space, so as to facilitate the authorities to arrange targeted inspections to enhance the safety of frontline workers?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the Drainage Services Department (DSD), my consolidated reply to the Hon Chau Siu-chung's question is as follows:

(1) and (6)The Labour Department (LD) conducts inspections of workplaces across the territory from time to time to ensure the safety and health of workers at work. As inspection of work in confined space is an integral part of the LD's routine occupational safety and health inspection, the LD did not specifically keep separate statistics on the number of routine inspection for such workplaces and related enforcement statistics. However, the LD has established a notification mechanism with key Government departments and a statutory body (including Drainage Services Department (DSD), Housing Department, Highways Department and the Airport Authority Hong Kong) responsible for drainage works since 2022. These parties will notify the LD regularly of the date and time of all their drainage works or underground pipeworks that require workers to enter confined spaces so as to facilitate the LD to select those confined space works with higher risk for surprise inspection and enhanced enforcement actions according to a risk-based strategy. Since the establishment of the notification mechanism to May 2025, the LD received a total of 8 608 notifications and conducted 780 inspections. The relevant notification and inspection figures are at Annex 1.

  During surprise inspections of confined space work, the LD personnel will review the relevant procedures and equipment, such as whether risk assessments have been conducted and whether corresponding risk control measures have been implemented, whether workers meet the requirements of training and relevant work experience, and whether workers engaged in underground pipeworks are wearing approved breathing apparatus and appropriate safety harnesses. In addition, since the revised ""Code of Practice for Safety and Health at Work in Confined Spaces"" came into effect on November 30, 2024, the LD personnel will pay particular attention to whether proprietors or contractors have implemented relevant measures in accordance with the Code, including recording videos at the entrances and exits of confined spaces while at work to further protect the occupational safety and health of workers. In the past three years, the LD has issued a total of 13 improvement notices and 136 warning letters to proprietors or contractors in the surprise inspections of workplaces that were notified to the LD through the notification system. The main irregularities involved failure to conduct comprehensive risk assessments, issuance of incomplete work permits, and failure to properly use approved breathing apparatus, etc. The relevant enforcement figures are at Annex 2.

(2)The Occupational Safety and Health Council (OSHC) launched the ""OSH Enhancement Scheme for SMEs for Safe Work at Confined Space 2.0"" in June 2022 to subsidise small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in purchasing appropriate safety equipment, including gas detectors and motion-sensing alarm devices, providing free relevant training courses and offering one-stop risk assessments. The scheme aims to help SMEs enhance safety standards in confined space work, particularly in workplaces such as manholes, sewers, and pipelines, and prevent accidents. Details of the scheme and related statistics are at Annex 3.

(3)The OSHC launched the OSH Star Enterprise - Confined Space Safety Accreditation Scheme in 2022. This scheme aims to provide tailor-made free OSH consultancy services, training courses, and subsidies for purchasing safety equipment to enterprises that have work conducted in confined spaces (such as manholes, sewers, pressure vessels/boilers, tunnels, pipelines, and water tanks). It also certifies enterprises that achieve a certain level of occupational safety and health performance, helping the industry to raise the standard of safety and health at work. Additionally, it facilitates owners or site managers to identify contractors with better occupational safety and health performance. Enterprises that successfully pass OSHC certification will become OSH Star Enterprise - Confined Space and be listed in the OSH Star Enterprise List – Confined Space Safety Accreditation Scheme for users' reference. Relevant statistics for the scheme are at Annex 4.

(4)The LD is highly concerned about the fatal work accident involving drainage works that occurred at Yuen Wo Road Playground in Sha Tin on the night of April 22, 2024. The LD has completed the investigation swiftly. Having consulted the Department of Justice, the LD has initiated a total of 43 prosecutions against the relevant contractor and subcontractor under the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance (Cap. 59) and its subsidiary regulations. The case is now under judicial proceedings.

(5)After the aforementioned fatal accident in Yuen Wo Playground in Sha Tin, the DSD immediately suspended all sewer cleansing work and conducted a detailed review of the relevant work procedure. The DSD updated its practice note and contract provisions related to work in confined space on May 31, 2024 and June 28, 2024, respectively. It is now stipulated that if a workers' entry into a confined space (including manhole) was not expected in project initially but it is found later that such entry is necessary, the contractor must immediately suspend the relevant work and notify the DSD. The contractor shall complete a risk assessment and implement necessary safety requirements in accordance with code of practice of confined space work, and obtain approval from the DSD before entering the confined space to carry out work.

(7)In addition to the above-mentioned notification mechanism established between the LD and the key Government departments and the statutory body responsible for drainage works, the LD also revised the Code of Practice for Safety and Health at Work in Confined Spaces in 2024 and strengthened related publicity and education to raise occupational safety and health awareness within the industry. In addition, the mandatory safety training courses for confined space operations, revised in accordance with the aforementioned Code, was also launched on November 30, 2024, to further enhance the safety standards of related work. We will continue to adopt a multi-pronged strategy, including strengthening inspections and enforcement, publicity and promotion, as well as education and training, to prevent accidents."
立法會十三題：輸入體育專才,2025-07-02 11:22,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200288.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上鄭泳舜議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據報近年先後有多位國際及內地體壇名將透過優秀人才入境計劃（優才計劃）或高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃）來港發展或定居。有意見認為本港具備匯聚體育人才的優勢，政府應進一步協助來港發展的體育專才，以推動本港體育產業的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年有多少名海外及內地運動或體育專才分別透過優才計劃及高才通計劃申請來港發展，以及當中獲批的個案宗數為何，並按專才所參與的運動項目列出分項數字；有否統計，獲批個案專才在港的就業情況；

（二）體育專才透過優才計劃或高才通計劃來港後，香港人才服務辦公室會如何跟進他們在港的發展和需要（包括曾為該等專才提供的支援服務及發展策略（如有））；

（三）據報過去一年有多位國際知名的桌球運動員先後透過優才計劃成為香港居民，當局會否考慮展開深化工作，協助該等桌球運動員在港推廣桌球或發展桌球事業，例如開辦桌球室或訓練班等，以帶動香港成為「國際桌球之都」；及

（四）會否考慮優化優才計劃或高才通計劃，或提供誘因（例如為短期或長期來港的一些國際體壇名將或體育專才提供稅務優惠），以吸引更多國際體育人才來港發展？

答覆：

主席：

為打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地，政府正推行各項不同定位的人才入境計劃，積極招攬多元背景的人才來港，建立優質人才庫以配合香港發展所需。

其中，優秀人才入境計劃（優才計劃）下的「成就計分制」旨在吸引具備超凡才能或技術並擁有傑出成就的人士來港定居，申請人須曾獲得傑出成就獎（例如奧林匹克運動會獎牌、諾貝爾獎、國家／國際獎項），或者可證明其工作得到同業肯定或對所屬界別的發展有重大貢獻（例如有關行業的終生成就獎），才符合「成就計分制」的申請資格。成功獲批的人士一般首次入境可獲准在港逗留八年。過往，絕大部分曾在大型運動賽事獲獎並已來港發展的國際及內地體壇名將，均透過上述渠道獲批來港。

就議員的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局及入境事務處（入境處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年），優才計劃下成功通過甄選程序的獲批個案中，共有42名退役或現役運動員按「成就計分制」獲批來港，包括不同運動項目的奧林匹克運動會獎牌得主、亞洲運動會獎牌得主，以及其他國際體育賽事的得獎者。

由於高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃）旨在吸納高收入或全球頂尖學府學士畢業的人才，入境處並不掌握來自退役／現役運動員的申請數目。

經優才計劃或高才通計劃來港的人士無須在來港前已在港覓得工作。在首個簽證有效期間，人才如在港受聘或開辦／參與業務，亦無須通知入境處。高才通計劃的獲批申請人在提出延長逗留期限申請時，須向入境處提供可信納的資料及文件，證明已在港受聘或開辦／參與業務，方可獲得續簽。入境處沒有備存上述兩個計劃下獲批申請人剛來港時的就業情況，以及提問涉及的其他分項統計數字。

（二）香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）自二○二三年十月三十日成立以來，一直以線上及線下形式，為不同人才入境計劃（包括優才計劃及高才通計劃）下來港／留港的人才提供全方位一站式支援。除設有線上平台（www.hkengage.gov.hk）提供有關在港生活及工作的全方位資訊，以及處理人才的查詢外，人才辦與合作夥伴舉辦多元化的線上線下活動，包括招聘會、專題研討會、工作坊（包括粤語學習班），以及社區共融活動（包括人才義工計劃），提供有關不同生活範疇、就業及創業等方面的資訊，協助來港人才落戶香港，以及盡快融入香港生活。線上平台連繫約90家指定合作夥伴，提供網上支援配對服務，在求職、住房、教育、綜合移居、銀行及保險服務、商務及企業服務和社群網絡等方面為人才提供建議和服務。

早前，不少國際知名的體育專才（如世界排名第一的桌球手卓林普（Judd Trump）及前美國職業籃球聯賽球員馬布里（Stephon Marbury））落戶香港，人才辦即邀請他們參與宣傳，親身分享來港的原因，對外宣傳及推廣香港的獨特優勢和發展機遇，吸引更多國際多元人才來港發展。

（三）多位國際知名的桌球運動員來港定居，帶動市民對桌球運動的關注與興趣。政府會積極推動本地桌球運動的發展，與來港發展的桌球名將保持聯繫，並在他們有需要時提供適切支援，攜手促進本地桌球運動的發展。

政府一直致力推動體育發展，積極落實普及化、精英化、盛事化、專業化和產業化五大政策目標。在推廣體育普及化方面，政府透過舉辦多元化的康樂體育活動，鼓勵市民參與，在社區建立熱愛體育的文化，協助他們培養健康生活模式。

政府亦會繼續投放資源，拓展熱愛體育（包括桌球運動）的觀眾群，並透過「M」品牌計劃支援主辦機構舉辦大型體育活動。今年三月，大型體育活動事務委員會向「世界格蘭披治桌球大獎賽2025」頒授「M」品牌認可。這項大賽首次在英國以外的地方舉行，不但有助推動本地桌球發展，而且彰顯香港作為國際體育盛事之都的地位。

（四）香港需要來自各行各業和具備不同技能的人才，難以為所有經優才計劃或高才通計劃來港發展的人才提供財政誘因或稅務優惠。香港在「一國兩制」下，擁有得天獨厚的優勢，既有祖國的強大支持，又與世界緊密相連。此外，香港亦擁有世界一流的營商環境、簡單的低稅制、高度開放的國際化市場等制度優勢，為香港的發展奠定了堅實的基礎。這些優勢也讓香港成為人才尋求個人成長和自我提升的理想之地，他們可以將創新理念付諸實踐，為世界帶來積極的改變。許多專業人士也選擇以香港為基地，探索內地的發展機遇。相關政策局和部門會繼續與行業的持份者保持緊密聯繫，了解行業最新發展及人力需求情況，持續完善招攬人才措施，例如為重點吸納從事特定行業的外來人才，提供針對性的支援。"
LCQ13: Admission of sports professionals,2025-07-02 11:22,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200290.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Vincent Cheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 It has been reported that in recent years, several international and Mainland sports stars have come to Hong Kong for development or settlement one after another through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) or the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS). There are views that Hong Kong possesses the advantage of attracting sports talent, and the Government should further assist sports professionals coming to Hong Kong for development, so as to promote the development of Hong Kong's sports industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of overseas and Mainland sports professionals who have applied over the past five years for coming to Hong Kong for development through QMAS and TTPS respectively, and among them, the number of applications approved, together with a breakdown by the sports disciplines in which the professionals are involved; whether it has compiled statistics on the employment status of professionals in Hong Kong in the approved cases;

(2) when sports professionals have come to Hong Kong through QMAS or TTPS, how the Hong Kong Talent Engage will follow up on their development and needs in Hong Kong (including support services and development strategies (if any) provided to such professionals);

(3) as it has been reported that several world-renowned billiard players have become Hong Kong residents one after another through QMAS over the past year, whether the authorities will consider launching further initiatives to assist these billiard players in promoting billiards or developing their careers in billiards in Hong Kong, such as opening billiard saloons or training programs, so as to help Hong Kong become an ""international billiard hub""; and

(4) whether it will consider optimising QMAS or TTPS, or providing incentives (such as providing tax concessions to international sports stars or sports professionals coming to Hong Kong on a short-term or long-term basis), so as to attract more international sports talent to come to Hong Kong for development?

Reply:

President,

 To build Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent, the Government has been implementing various talent admission schemes with different positioning to proactively trawl for talent with diversified backgrounds to come to Hong Kong to build a quality talent pool for meeting Hong Kong's development needs.

 Among them, the Achievement-based Points Test (APT) under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) aims to attract individuals with exceptional talents or skills, as well as outstanding achievements, to come to Hong Kong for settlement. To be eligible for APT, the applicant must have received an award of exceptional achievement (e.g. Olympic medal, Nobel prize, national/international award) or can show that his/her work has been acknowledged by his/her peers or have contributed significantly to the development of his/her field (e.g. lifetime achievement award from industry). Successful applicants will normally be granted a stay of eight years upon first entry. In the past, the majority of international and Mainland sports celebrities who had won awards in major sports events and had come to Hong Kong for development were admitted through the above channel.

 Our reply to the Member's questions, in consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), is as follows:

(1) In the past five years (from 2020 to 2024), among the approved cases that have successfully passed the selection exercise under theQMAS, a total of 42 retired or serving athletes have been approved to come to Hong Kong under theAPT, including Olympic medalists, Asian Games medalists, and winners of other international sports events.

 As the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) aims to attract individuals with high income or full-time bachelor's degree from top universities/institutions around the world, the ImmD does not have the number of applications from retired/serving athletes.

 Persons admitted to Hong Kong under the QMAS or the TTPS are not required to have secured offers of employment before coming to Hong Kong. During the validity period of the first visa, the talent are not required to inform the ImmD when they are employed or have established/joined in business in Hong Kong. When applying for extension of stay, successful applicants under the TTPS are required to provide the ImmD with concrete supporting information and documents to prove that they have been employed or have established/joined in business in Hong Kong so that an extension of stay can be granted. The ImmD does not maintain statistics on the employment situation of successful applicants under the above two schemes when they first arrived in Hong Kong, as well as other statistical breakdowns mentioned in the question.

(2) Since its establishment on October 30, 2023, Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) has been providing comprehensive one-stop support to talent coming to / staying in Hong Kong under the various talent admission schemes (including theTTPS and theQMAS) through both online and offline means. Apart from providing comprehensive information on living and working in Hong Kong as well as handling enquiries from outside talent through its online platform (www.hkengage.gov.hk), HKTE organises with working partners a variety of online and offline activities such as job fairs, themed seminars, workshops (including Cantonese learning classes) and social integration activities (including Talent+ Volunteer Programme) to share information on entrepreneurship, employment as well as other living tips and to help the incoming talent to settle in Hong Kong and integrate into the city as soon as possible. The online platform is connected to about 90 designated working partners of HKTE to provide recommendations and services in areas such as job seeking, accommodation, education, integrated settlement, banking and insurance, business and corporate services as well as networking and community, through online matching tools.

 Earlier on, many internationally renowned sports professionals (such as Judd Trump, the world's number one snooker player, and Stephon Marbury, former National Basketball Association (NBA) player) have settled in Hong Kong. HKTE has invited them to participate in promotional activities to give first-hand sharing of their reasons for coming to Hong Kong, thereby promoting Hong Kong's unique strengths and development opportunities to attract more global talent with diverse backgrounds to pursue development in Hong Kong.

(3) Several internationally renowned snooker players have settled in Hong Kong, drawing public attention and interest for the sport. The Government will actively promote the development of local billiard sports, maintain connections with top snooker players pursuing development in Hong Kong, and provide appropriate support when needed to foster the development of billiard sports in Hong Kong together.

 The Government is committed to sports development through the five policy objectives of promoting sports in the community, supporting elite sports, maintaining Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events, enhancing professionalism, and developing sports as an industry. For the promotion of community sports, the Government organises various types of recreation and sports activities and encourages public participation to cultivate a strong sporting culture in the community, helping them develop a healthy lifestyle.

 The Government will continue to devote resources to expand the audience base of sports enthusiasts (including snooker fans) and support the organisation of major sports events through the ""M"" Mark System. The Major Sports Events Committee awarded the ""M"" Mark status to the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 in March this year. It was the first time for the event to be held outside the United Kingdom. In addition to promoting the development of billiard sports in Hong Kong, the event also underlines Hong Kong's status as the centre for major international sports events.

(4) Hong Kong needs talent from various industries with diverse skills. It is difficult to provide financial incentives or tax benefits to all kinds of talent coming to Hong Kong for development under theQMAS or theTTPS. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is bestowed with unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of our motherland and being closely connected to the world. In addition, Hong Kong has a strong foundation for success, with institutional strengths such as a world-class business environment, a simple and low tax system, and a highly open and internationalised market. All these strengths make Hong Kong an ideal place for talent looking for personal growth and self-enhancement, as they can bring their innovative ideas to life and make positive changes to the world. Many professionals also choose to base in Hong Kong to explore development opportunities in Mainland China. Relevant bureaux and departments will continue to stay in close touch with industry stakeholders to understand the latest developments and manpower needs of the industries, and continuously improve the measures to trawl for talent, such as providing targeted support with a view to attracting outside talent engaged in specific industries."
LCQ18: Management of Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin,2025-07-02 11:10,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200291.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

There are views that the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin, being an important historical and cultural temple, has a profound history and extensive social influence. Regarding the management of the temple, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that according to the information provided by the Chinese Temples Committee, the annual surplus of the Che Kung Temple for the year ended March 31 last year exceeded $16 million, whether the Government knows the intended specific uses of the surplus, including whether it will be transferred to the General Chinese Charities Fund under the Chinese Temples Ordinance (Cap. 153) or used for community projects in Sha Tin District;

(2) whether it knows, in respect of major decisions relating to the Che Kung Temple (e.g. the expansion project and the adjustment of fees for services provided in the temple), how the Committee seeks the views of worshippers or heritage conservation groups, and whether the Committee has held open meetings or kept records of such consultations on a regular basis; if the Committee has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it knows if the Committee has formulated development strategies for the Che Kung Temple for the next 10 years, including coping with the growth in visitor flow, providing digitalised services (e.g. using a platform for electronic blessings) or implementing environmental protection measures (e.g. reducing the pollution caused by joss sticks); if the Committee has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Chinese Temples Committee is a statutory body established in accordance with the Chinese Temples Ordinance (Cap. 153). At present, there are around 350 temples registered with the Committee or managed by the Committee through different means. The Che Kung Temple, Shatin, is one of the administered temples under the Committee.

I give the reply in response to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Li as follows:

According to the Ordinance, all revenues from the administered temples under the Committee (including the Che Kung Temple) must first be transferred to the Chinese Temples Fund (CTF). The temple keepers of individual administered temples do not have the authority to determine the use of these revenues. The CTF is primarily used for the purposes of organising customary ceremonies and the maintenance of the temple buildings and temple properties and so on. For instance, the Committee has granted fundings under relevant funding schemes to the Ta Chiu Festival Committee of Kau Yeuk of the Sha Tin Rural Committee for organising the decennial Ta Chiu Festival in the Year of Yisi, and to the Sha Tin Rural Committee for organising the Che Kung worshipping event. Any surpluses from the CTF may be transferred to the General Chinese Charities Fund (GCCF), also managed by the Committee, for the purposes of any Chinese charity in Hong Kong. It includes grants to the Home Affairs Department for provision of emergency financial relief to needy persons of Chinese race who are affected by natural disasters or accidents, as well as the GCCF funding scheme supporting charitable activities and projects for the Chinese community in Hong Kong. The use of surpluses from the CTF is also governed by the Ordinance and is not subject to the discretion of the temple keepers of individual administered temples.

The Committee and its working groups render advice on matters relating to the operations of its administered temples (including the Che Kung Temple). Specifically, the Works Working Group under the Committee discusses matters relating to the planning and management of its temples, and submit recommendations to the Committee. For temple maintenance and related matters, the Committee would consult relevant stakeholders as appropriate. For example, the Committee would seek advice from the Antiquities and Monuments Office on works for administered temples under the Committee that are declared monuments. The Committee's meetings are not open to the public, and related documents are therefore not disclosed to the public.

The Committee has all along been keeping abreast of the overall development of temple-related matters, striving to keep up with the times to meet the needs of worshippers and visitors of its administered temples (including the Che Kung Temple). For example, the Committee has made postcards for its six administered temples that are declared monuments and installed debossing stations at these temples for collection by worshippers and visitors. The Committee has also been actively promoting digital services, such as installing a digital wishing board display at the Che Kung Temple in recent years. Besides, during the recent maintenance and repainting of the Che Kung statue, the Committee has introduced naked-eye 3D technology to project images of Che Kung. Furthermore, in respect of environmental protection measures, the Committee is committed to implementing green facilities at its administered temples, including smoke filtration systems and eco-friendly joss paper burners and so on."
立法會十八題：沙田車公廟的管理,2025-07-02 11:10,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200284.htm,"​以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上李世榮議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見認為沙田車公廟（車公廟）作為重要歷史文化廟宇，具有深厚的歷史底蘊和廣泛的社會影響力。關於該廟的管理，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於根據華人廟宇委員會（委員會）的資料，車公廟截至去年三月三十一日止的年度盈餘超過1,600萬元，政府是否知悉，該盈餘所擬作的具體用途為何，包括會否撥入《華人廟宇條例》（第153章）下的華人慈善基金或用於沙田區的社區項目；

（二）是否知悉就車公廟相關的重大決策（例如擴建工程及廟內的服務收費調整等），委員會如何徵詢善信或文物保護團體的意見，以及有否定期舉行公開會議或備存諮詢紀錄；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）是否知悉委員會有否制定車公廟未來10年的發展戰略，包括應對遊客流量增長、提供數碼化服務（例如使用電子祈福平台）或推行環保措施（例如減少香燭污染）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

華人廟宇委員會（委員會）是根據《華人廟宇條例》（第153章）（《條例》）成立的法定機構。現時共有約350間廟宇向委員會註冊或由委員會以不同方式管理。沙田車公廟（車公廟）是由委員會管理的其中一間直轄廟宇。

就李世榮議員的提問，現回覆如下：

根據《條例》的規定，委員會轄下所有直轄廟宇（包括車公廟）的收入須先撥入華人廟宇基金，而非由各直轄廟宇的司祝自行決定收入的用途。華人廟宇基金主要用於進行傳統儀式，以及廟宇建築物及其財產的維修等用途。舉例而言，委員會曾在相關資助計劃下撥款資助沙田鄉事委員會九約建醮委員會舉辦沙田鄉事委員會九約十年一屆乙巳年太平清醮，以及資助沙田鄉事委員會舉辦參拜車公活動等。華人廟宇基金的盈餘則可撥入同樣由委員會管理的華人慈善基金，供本港華人慈善活動用途，包括撥款予民政事務總署用作緊急援助金，以幫助受天災或意外影響的本港華人，以及設有華人慈善基金撥款資助計劃，資助本港的華人慈善活動及計劃。華人廟宇基金的盈餘用途也受《條例》規範，同樣也不是由各直轄廟宇的司祝決定。

委員會及其轄下的工作小組會就委員會轄下廟宇（包括車公廟）的運作及相關事宜提供建議。其中，委員會轄下設有工程小組，就委員會轄下廟宇工程的規劃、管理及相關事宜進行討論，並向委員會呈交建議。就廟宇維修工作等事宜而言，委員會會按需要諮詢相關持份者，例如若廟宇屬法定古蹟的話，委員會會諮詢古物古蹟辦事處的意見。委員會的會議不作公開，故相關文件也不會公開。

委員會一直密切留意與廟宇相關的整體發展，致力在各方面與時俱進，以符合到訪各直轄廟宇（包括車公廟）的善信及遊客的需要。舉例而言，委員會就其轄下的六間法定古蹟廟宇印製了法定古蹟廟宇神祇明信片，並在相關廟宇設置壓印，鼓勵善信或遊客到訪收集。委員會亦一直推動數碼化服務，例如近年在車公廟內設立數碼金榜題名顯示屏，並在近月維修及重髹車公廟車公神像期間，引入裸眼3D技術，展示車公元帥的影像。此外，在推行環保措施方面，委員會亦致力在其直轄廟宇引入環保設施，例如淨煙處理系統、環保化寳爐等。"
Ombudsman's three strategic focuses deliver results and tangible benefits to community (with photo),2025-07-02 11:00,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200298.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (July 2) presented the 2024-25 Annual Report of The Ombudsman to the public. The Office exceeded all its service targets in handling enquiries, complaints, reassessment and review of complaints in the reporting year.

  Mr Chan said, ""Since assuming office on April 1 last year, I have championed three strategic focuses: (1) enhancing mediation to effectively and swiftly resolve public complaints; (2) fostering interdepartmental collaboration to provide highly efficient and quality public services; and (3) cultivating a positive and proactive complaint culture within the community. These three initiatives are designed to improve the quality of public administration, deliver tangible benefits to our citizens, and encourage the Government and citizens to foster a more stable, harmonious and progressive society for all.""

  In the reporting year, the Office concluded an all-time high of 555 cases by mediation, nearly tripling the number of the previous year and accounting for 33.5 per cent of the cases pursued. Given that the average time taken to resolve a complaint by way of mediation was only 10.87 days, it significantly expedited the process of redressing grievances for the public.

  On the front of fostering interdepartmental collaboration, the Office completed three direct investigation operations and processed 141 complaint cases during the year in this connection.

  The Office has stepped up efforts to cultivate a positive complaint culture. In addition to the annual Ombudsman's Awards Scheme, the Office issued 41 appreciation letters to 16 departments and organisations, and presented 19 appreciation certificates to complainants during the year, recognising their contribution to the enhancement of public administration. For the first time, the Office hosted seminars for universities and tertiary institutes, with a total of 13 seminars held at tertiary and secondary institutes throughout the year to promote a positive complaint culture. The Office is in active preparation for establishing the Hong Kong International Ombudsman Academy to provide appropriate training for government departments and public organisations, enhance the professional capabilities of staff of the Office, and promote exchanges and co-operation between the Office and overseas ombudsman institutions.

  The Office completed eight direct investigation operations and 40 full investigations during the year, delivering a total of 254 recommendations, 37 per cent more compared to that of the previous year, for improvement of public administration. All the recommendations were accepted by the government departments or organisations concerned, including some having been pursued and implemented. From November 2024 onwards, the Office started making observations in cases concluded after inquiries to highlight the improvements that had been or could be put in place more speedily. As at March 31, 2025, 106 observations had been made and were well received by the government departments or public organisations concerned.

  In the reporting year, the Office received 4 402 complaints on various topics and completed 4 664 cases (including some carried over from the preceding year), of which 3 009 were assessed and closed and 1 655 pursued and concluded.

在促進跨部門跨機構協作方面，在年度內，公署完成了三宗涉及跨部門及機構協作的主動調查行動及成功處理了141宗涉及跨部門及機構協作的個案。

公署全力宣揚「正面看申訴」這個理念，在年度內，除了每年的申訴專員嘉許獎計劃外，亦向16個部門和機構發出共41封嘉許信，以及向申訴人致送了19張感謝狀，以表揚他們對改善公共行政的貢獻。公署亦首次為大學、大專院校舉辦講座，全年為大學和中學舉辦了共13場「正面看申訴」講座。公署正積極籌備成立香港國際申訴專員學院，為政府部門及公營機構提供適切的培訓，提升公署員工的專業能力，並且促進公署與海外申訴機構的交流和合作。

公署在年度內完成了八項主動調查行動及40個全面調查個案，合共提出了254項改善公共行政的建議，較去年建議的總數增加了37%，建議全數獲相關政府部門或機構接納，部分建議亦已獲跟進及落實。由二○二四年十一月起，公署亦對以查訊方式完成處理的個案提出觀點，點出已實行的改善措施或可從速改善之處。截至二○二五年三月三十一日，公署提出了106項觀點均獲相關政府部門和公營機構接納。

公署在本年度接到4 402宗涉及不同課題的申訴個案，並完成處理了4 664宗（連同由上一年度轉入的個案），當中3 009宗經評審後結案，以及1 655宗已跟進並結案。

尊敬的梁君彥主席（立法會主席）、各位議員、各位秘書處和政府的同事：

大家好。今天我很高興能參與立法會圖書館優化設施及服務的啟用儀式。

與我們平時熟悉的圖書館有些不同，立法會圖書館作為憲制圖書館，超過一半的館藏都與憲制及議會有關。自二○一二年立法會綜合大樓啟用以來，立法會圖書館一直為使用者提供不同資源，幫助他們了解立法會的職能、工作和歷史，以至內地和其他地方的憲制制度發展。

立法會一直精益求精，去年底通過一系列圖書館設施及服務的優化建議，打造一個現代化的圖書館。經優化的圖書館除了有舒適的閱讀區及很多政策藏書外，剛才主席亦有提到，亦增設了科技創意空間，配備3D打印機、航拍無人機及虛擬實境裝置，為訪客帶來嶄新的體驗，令圖書館也可以很有活力，經驗可以很不一樣。這些創新設施不但提升了圖書館的功能與吸引力，亦有助公眾更深入了解立法會的工作。

優化後的圖書館亦設有一個全新的專題展覽空間。剛才主席亦有提到，打響頭炮的展覽以「行政立法關係」為主題，回顧香港百多年來行政與立法關係的演變，我覺得非常有意義。

我們在國家的大力支持下，成功落實「愛國者治港」。無論是審議法案和撥款建議、或是為政策措施出謀獻策，現在的立法會議員都以理性、務實的方式議政，實事求是、分秒必爭。在香港邁向「由治及興」的新征程上，政府會繼續和立法會攜手合作，堅持互相尊重，持續良性互動，為市民謀幸福，為香港謀發展，這是我們最重要的目標。

最後，我要再次恭賀立法會順利完成優化圖書館的工程，期待我們更多的年輕人、一般市民，甚至是來自世界各個地方的遊客，都能親身來體驗香港特區立法會的好故事。謝謝大家。"

駐滬辦主任蔡亮致辭時表示，特區政府全力發展經濟，取得亮麗的成績。她鼓勵上海和華東地區的民眾和企業未來繼續用好香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，在香港探索不同的商機、開展投資、就業創業。她亦期望滬港兩地未來在經貿、創科、文化、青年發展等多個方面繼續鼎力合作，共赴雙贏。

駐滬辦今日亦聯同投資推廣署主辦「香港—助力內地餐飲食品企業『走出去』交流會」，向超過100位來自華東地區的餐飲、食品及其他業界代表分享香港作為營商首選地的優勢及發展機遇，鼓勵參會企業落戶香港，並透過香港拓展海外市場。"

Delivering a speech at the dinner reception, the Director of the SHETO, Mrs Laura Aron, highlighted that the HKSAR Government has focused on economic development, achieving remarkable results. She encouraged citizens and enterprises in Shanghai and the East China region to continue leveraging Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore business opportunities, invest, and pursue employment or entrepreneurship in Hong Kong. She also expressed hope for continued robust co-operation between Shanghai and Hong Kong in areas such as trade, innovation, culture, and youth development, fostering mutual benefits.

Mrs Aron mentioned that next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the SHETO. She expressed gratitude to the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their support for the work of the HKSAR Government and the SHETO. The SHETO will continue to facilitate Shanghai-Hong Kong co-operation and support mutual success to make greater contributions to the country's high-quality development.

The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Management), Mr Chan Joon-sun, who is visiting Shanghai, attended the dinner. Speaking at the dinner reception, he shared that each anniversary occasion is an opportunity to review the development and achievements of ""one country, two systems"". With the introduction of the dual legislation on national security, Hong Kong has embarked on a new journey, advancing from chaos to order, and from stability to prosperity. It demonstrates the institutional advantages and strong vitality of ""one Country, two systems"". The country has been providing Hong Kong with opportunities to leverage its unique advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, promoting two-way exchanges between the mainland and the international community.

Hong Kong member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Shanghai and Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of New Frontier Group, Mr Carl Wu, also shared remarks at the dinner on Shanghai's support for Hong Kong-invested enterprises and the exchanges between Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The SHETO also invited emerging Hong Kong young artists to perform at the dinner reception, showcasing Hong Kong's diverse cultural charm through a suona performance blending Chinese and Western elements. Several Hong Kong students in Shanghai were also invited to showcase their talents.

The theme of the dinner reception was ""Multifaceted Hong Kong, Infinite Possibilities"", featuring interactive exhibition areas and photo check-in points themed around nine tourism development projects recently announced by the Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, alongside the giant pandas gifted by the Central Government as design ideas, offering guests an immersive, multifaceted, and engaging experience of Hong Kong.

The SHETO, in collaboration with Invest Hong Kong, also organised a seminar entitled ""Hong Kong: Enabler of Mainland Catering and Food Enterprises to Go Global"" today. Insights on the competitive advantages and development opportunities of Hong Kong as a preferred place for business were shared with over 100 representatives from catering, food and other industrial sectors in the East China region.
