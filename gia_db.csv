醫務化驗師管理委員會與培訓機構及專業團體代表會面,2025-06-27 21:47,2025-06-27 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700727.htm,"下稿代醫務化驗師管理委員會發出：

醫務化驗師管理委員會（委員會）於昨日（六月二十六日）與培訓機構及專業團體代表舉行會議，就委員會二○二四年關於課程大綱標準檢討及修訂作詳細說明及溝通。於學時總數維持不變的原則下，修訂四個基本範疇，即臨牀微生物及感染學、解剖病理學、化學病理學及血液學的每項最少臨牀檢驗實習時數要求，調整為50小時。騰出的200小時將可提供更彈性的安排，允許培訓機構靈活分配至新興和急速發展的醫務化驗科目，例如臨牀免疫學、人工智能、分子技術及基因組檢測等，及／或加強學生在基本範疇和新範疇的臨牀檢驗實習。

委員會在會議上重申，整體最少學時總數維持不變，而將此安排視為削減培訓時數實屬誤解。更新後的培訓要求旨在為培訓機構提供靈活性，促進現有及新課程綱要的持續過渡和完善，讓學生在應對迅速發展的醫療技術挑戰時更具競爭力，同時維持專業水平。

根據《輔助醫療業條例》（第359章）及《醫務化驗師（註冊及紀律處分程序）規例》（第359A章）（條例及規例），委員會具有法定職能促進醫務化驗師從業員在專業實務及專業操守方面達到足夠水平。條例及規例明確規訂，所有醫務化驗師必須具備不少於三年在監督下執業的資歷後，當中包括密集在職培訓，方可獨立執業以確保病人安全。

委員會已邀請各培訓機構提交其最新的醫務化驗師培訓課程綱要以供審批。委員會將繼續與醫務化驗師業界、培訓機構及醫護專業保持溝通，以確保病人安全及提升專業水平。"
Medical Laboratory Technologists Board meets representatives of training institutions and professional associations,2025-06-27 21:47,2025-06-27 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700728.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Medical Laboratory Technologists (MLT) Board:

âA meeting was held by the MLT Board yesterday (June 26) with representatives of training institutions and professional associations to provide detailed explanations and communicate on the decision of the MLT Board in 2024 about the review and amendment of accreditation criteria of programmes, in maintaining the total required hours for training, to amend the minimum hours for clinical practice/attachment in the major four basic areas, namely ""Clinical Microbiology & Infection"", ""Anatomical Pathology"", ""Chemical Pathology"" and ""Haematology"" to 50 hours each, with the released 200 hours for training institutions to flexibly allocate to new and rapidly evolving medical laboratory science subjects, such as clinical immunology, artificial intelligence, molecular techniques and genetic testing etc., and/or to perform enhanced clinical practice/attachment in the four basic areas as well as in the new areas.

The MLT Board reiterated at the meeting that the overall minimal training hours would remain unchanged, and it was a misunderstanding to perceive the arrangement as cutting down training hours. The updated training requirement would facilitate training institutions with the flexibility to enable continuous transition/improvement of the curriculum both in existing and new programmes, to better prepare our students for the challenge of quickly evolving medical technologies, while maintaining professional standards.

Under the Supplementary Medical Professions Ordinance (Cap. 359) and the Medical Laboratory Technologists (Registration and Disciplinary Procedure) Regulations (Cap. 359A) (Ordinance and Regulations), the MLT Board was empowered to promote adequate standards of professional practice and conduct among members of the profession. The Ordinance and Regulations specified that all MLTs must obtain at least three years of post-qualification experience involving intensive on-the-job training under supervision before they could practise independently to ensure patients' safety.

The MLT Board had invited institutions to submit their updated curriculum on the training of MLT for approval. The MLT Board will continue to communicate with the MLT industry, training institutions and healthcare professions to ensure patient safety and enhance professional standard."

Charles (Yang) (Council Chairman of the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts(HKAPA), Mr Charles Yang), Professor Anna Chan (Directorof theHKAPA), å¼µå¿è¯å¯ä¸»ä»» (Deputy Director-General of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the People's Government of Guangdong Province Mr Zhang Zhihua), ææ¬å¯é¨é· (Deputy Director-General of the Department of Publicity, Cultural and Sports Affairs of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Lin Nan), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is both an honour and a privilege to join you tonight in celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.

Allow me to begin by extending my warmest congratulations to the Academy. For four decades, you have stood as a pillar of performing arts education and creative innovation in Hong Kong, shaping the artistic landscape of our city and beyond.

Since its founding in 1984, the Academy has played a vital role in nurturing generations of world-class talent in performing arts and arts technology. From drama to music, and from dance to film and television, your graduates have brought to life a rich tapestry of performances and productions that have captivated audiences, enriched our cultural fabric, and deepened public appreciation for arts and culture.

The many acclaimed film makers nurtured by the Academy is a compelling example. Their works and productions have defined Hong Kong cinema and extended its influence far beyond the territory, being recognised as a cultural force across the region and around the world.

Today, the global entertainment industry is massive and rapidly evolving. It is also a multi-billion dollar business. In recent years, we have seen the rise of cultural powerhouses from this part of the world like Korea. And the Mainland is emerging as an important player as well. Despite changing market trends and challenges, Hong Kong producers continue to shine. The recent success of local productions, such as ""Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In"" ãä¹é¾åå¯¨ä¹ååãand ""The Last Dance"" ãç´·å°çã, stands as a testament to the enduring strength of our creative industries. It tells that we can capture the hearts of local, Mainland and international audiences with quality productions. It is the innovative spirit, artistic excellence, and a bold embrace of new technologies that will drive the future of the industry.

Meanwhile, for performing arts, our unique connectivity with the Greater Bay Area, together with world-class performing venues offers unparalleled opportunities for our arts groups and performers. Opportunities to expand their reach, build their brands, and step confidently onto the regional and global stage. Seizing these opportunities requires not only talent and capital, but also vision, passion and an unwavering commitment to excellence.

In fact, a flourishing arts and creative sector is not only a powerful engine of economic growth, but also an important pillar of soft power.

In a world increasingly marked by fragmentation and conflicts, we must ask ourselves: do we need more confrontation, or more dialogue? More isolation, or greater understanding? I believe the answer is clear to all of us. And in this connection, arts and culture are a profound and irreplaceable means of fostering mutual understanding, empathy and unison.

Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to contribute to this global dialogue. With our openness, diversity and international character, there is no better place than Hong Kong to be an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. And through your work - your performances, your productions, your stories - I am sure the perspectives of Hong Kong, and of our country, will be better shared by the world. 

In advancing these strategic goals, the Academy has been, and will continue to be, an important partner.

That is why, in the 2022 Policy Address, the Government entrusted the Academy with an important new mission: to deepen its role in talent development for the Greater Bay Area, and to broaden its educational footprint through the establishment of a new campus in the Northern Metropolis. This initiative reflects both our confidence in the Academy's capabilities and our shared aspiration to elevate performing arts across the region.

As the Academy looks to the future, let us remember: talent is the key to our continued success - and indeed the success of any institution, industry and society.

I have every confidence that the Academy will remain true to its founding mission, and continue to cultivate the next generation of artists not only with skills and creativity but also with vision, heart and passion.

And I have every confidence too, that the Academy will rise to the challenges and capture the opportunities ahead, strengthen its international presence, and flourish as a premier performing arts institution - not only in Asia, but on the world stage.

On this note, I wish the entire Academy community - your dedicated faculty, talented students and accomplished alumni - every success as you continue your pursuit of artistic excellence with passion, purpose, and pride.

Once again, my heartfelt congratulations to the Academy. May you continue to inspire, innovate and illuminate. And may the next chapter of your journey be even more brilliant than the last. Thank you."

  Guests attending the launching ceremony included the Director of Immigration, Mr Benson Kwok; Olympic diving gold medallist Ms Guo Jingjing; the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk; the Director-General of the Consular Department of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs(OCMFA) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Wei Wenxiu, representatives from the Education Bureau (EDB), as well as representatives and students from schools in Tseung Kwan O.

  Speaking at the launching ceremony, Mr Kwok said that consular protection has always been the most solid backing for Hong Kong people travelling abroad. With the full support of the OCMFA and the Chinese diplomatic and consular missions overseas, the Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit (AHU) of the ImmD is committed to providing practicable assistance to Hong Kong residents in distress outside Hong Kong. At the same time, the ImmD attaches great importance to promoting outbound travel safety. Over the years, it has collaborated with the OCMFA from time to time to organise various publicity activities to raise people's awareness of outbound travel safety, while enhancing their understanding of national consular protection and the work of the AHU.

  To promote consular protection provided by the country and reach a wider audience, the ImmD has published an illustrated book for children, featuring 1868 Ambassador Ah Bong, the AHU's mascot. The book aims to help primary and kindergarten students recognise the importance of consular protection, thereby strengthening their sense of belonging to the country. It will be distributed to over 1500 primary schools and kindergartens across the territory, and its electronic version will also be uploaded to the ImmD and EDB webpages for teachers' reference and use.

  This year marks the 20th anniversary of the 1868 Assistance Hotline. Starting today until July 25, the ImmD will be hosting an exhibition on the ground floor of the Immigration Headquarters to introduce the public to the consular protection provided by the country and the services of the 1868 Assistance Hotline, together with relevant information on outbound travel safety. The exhibition will be open to the public free of charge from 8.45am to 4.30pm, Monday to Friday, and from 8.45am to 11.30am on Saturday (except public holidays)."

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-06-27 20:16,2025-06-27 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700810.htm," An incoming passenger was sentenced to ten weeks' imprisonment and fined $1,800 at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (June 27) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

 Customs officers intercepted the incoming 43-year-old female passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point yesterday (June 26) and seized 1 381 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $5,600 and a duty potential of about $4,500 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

 Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

 Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

海關人員於昨日（六月二十六日）在落馬洲支線管制站截查該名四十三歲抵港女旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲一千三百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約五千六百元，應課稅值約四千五百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

The exhibition will run at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre from tomorrow (June 28), featuring significant Tang dynasty artefacts unearthed on the Mainland and in Hong Kong to showcase the inclusiveness, diversity and openness of the prosperous Tang dynasty, and introduce Hong Kong's pivotal role in the Maritime Silk Road.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, said that, as one of the celebration activities of the 28th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland, this is the largest joint exhibition, in terms of profile, scale and quantity of artefacts on display, since the signing of the Framework Agreement on Deepening Exchange and Cooperation in the Field of Heritage Architecture and Archaeology between the DEVB and the National Cultural Heritage Administration in 2022. The exhibition marks a move towards a higher level of mutual co-operation. Hong Kong is an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. She is eagerly anticipating that the exhibition can showcase the culture of the majestic Tang dynasty to members of the public and friends from all over the world.

Other officiating guests at the ceremony were Deputy Administrator of the National Cultural Heritage Administration Mr Qiao Yunfei; the Secretary General of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Wang Songmiao; the Permanent Secretary for Development (Works), Mr Ricky Lau; the Director of Art Exhibitions China, Mr Tan Ping; the Chairman of the Antiquities Advisory Board, Professor Desmond Hui; and the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Built Heritage Conservation, Professor Douglas So.

The exhibition is divided into eight sections on the administrative system and governance of the Tang dynasty, the planning of Chang'an city, the life of people, religious beliefs, literati elegance, craftsmanship, prosperous scenes along the Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road, and Hong Kong's role as a node on the Maritime Silk Road in the Tang dynasty. It features 269 significant pieces/sets of artefacts from 28 museums and cultural institutions in 10 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities on the Mainland (including 49 pieces/sets of grade-one cultural relics) and 29 pieces/sets of important artefacts unearthed in Hong Kong and dated to the Tang dynasty.

Among the key exhibits are two paintings, namely the ""Scroll depicting Emperor Minghuang playing polo"", which is a Song dynasty depiction of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (Minghuang) playing polo with his concubines on horseback; and the hanging scroll of Li Bai's ""Chun Ye Yan Tao Li Yuan Xu"" (preface to the spring night banquet in the peach and plum garden) on kesi (cut silk) depicting the refined life of Tang dynasty literati. These paintings will only be displayed during the first two months (June 28 to August 27). Other key exhibits include a sancai teaware set with a seated figurine revealing the image of Lu Yu, China's sage of tea; a gold jie comb (hair comb accessory) carved in openwork from a thin piece of gold; a painted figurine of a dancing black man with exotic charm; the ""Lun Yu Zheng Xuan Zhu"" (the Analects with annotation by Zheng Xuan) copied by Bu Tianshou, which has been included in the first batch of the National Catalogue of Precious Ancient Books; and a crimson gold walking dragon used in ritual ceremonies, which will be displayed throughout the entire exhibition period.

The exhibition also displays significant Tang dynasty artefacts unearthed at Chek Lap Kok, Tung Chung and San Tau on Lantau Island in Hong Kong, including ceramic ware, iron weapons, bronze belt ornaments, silver chai hairpin, glass ring, fragment of silver piece, Kai Yuan Tong Bao (circulating treasure from a new era) and Qian Yuan Zhong Bao (heavy treasure of Qian Yuan reign) bronze coins, to illustrate the role of Hong Kong in the Maritime Silk Road.

The exhibition will run at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park, Haiphong Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, from tomorrow to December 31 with free admission. For details and a short video on the preparation of the exhibition, please visit the website of the Antiquities and Monuments Office of the DEVB."
Caritas Medical Centre announces sentinel event,2025-06-27 19:20,2025-06-27 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700746.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for Caritas Medical Centre (CMC) announced a sentinel event today (June 27):

A 48-year-old female patient with good past health was admitted to the hospital's surgical ward on June 17 for abdominal pain. The patient underwent an abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast on June 18 which indicated early appendicitis, mild colitis and a small paratubal cyst on the right side.

On the same night, the patient was arranged for an emergent minimally invasive laparoscopic appendectomy operated by a higher surgical trainee. During the operation, oozing from the surgical site was noted, and the small paratubal cyst was torn during the procedure. The on-call Associate Consultant was called in. The Associate Consultant arrived and consulted the Obstetrics and Gynaecology team at Princess Margaret Hospital, where it was confirmed that a cystectomy was not required as the bleeding had stopped. The patient remained in stable condition after the operation and continued to receive close observation and treatment. The excised tissue was sent to the pathology department for examination.

On the afternoon of June 23, the patient developed a low-grade fever with increasing abdominal pain and afterwards underwent an abdominal CT scan with contrast again. The report revealed the appendix remained intact and the pathology report, which was available in the late evening of June 25, showed that the excised tissue was a fallopian tube instead of the appendix.

The hospital is very concerned about the incident and met with the patient and her family on the following morning (June 26) to explain the details of the incident and to offer their sincerest apologies. Subsequently, the patient underwent an operation to have the inflamed appendix removed. The operation was uneventful. The hospital will continue to closely monitor her post-operative recovery.

The preliminary investigation suggests the doctor involved mistook the fallopian tube for the appendix due to tissue adhesion near the surgical site.

âThe CMC once again extended sincere apologies to the patient, and has requested the Department of Surgery to review the arrangements and handling of laparoscopic surgeries, including staffing deployment, task assignment, supervision and coaching. Training for frontline healthcare staff will also be strengthened to ensure proper management of every procedure-related detail to safeguard patient safety.

The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority Head Office via the Advance Incident Reporting System. A root cause analysis panel will be formed to investigate the incident thoroughly. The investigation and recommended improvement measures will be completed within eight weeks.

The Root Cause Analysis Panel members are as follows:

Chairperson
Dr Sara Ho
Service Director (Quality and Safety), Hong Kong East Cluster

Members

Vivian（香港機場管理局（機管局）行政總裁張李佳蕙）、機管局同事、各位機場同業：

今日在此濟濟一堂，很高興見到大家。今日是我云云眾多工作之中最期待的一個，因為一想到機場便自自然然很開心、很興奮，不只想起去旅行，工作也很開心。

今日主題很好，因為今次是三跑道落成之後的新時代中，在擴容和提升運力後，機管局和勞工處再一次舉辦職業博覽會。剛才我匆匆經過展覽攤位，覺得和一般在勞工處舉辦的招聘博覽會不同，這不僅是一個招聘，而且是展示香港國際機場和香港作為國際航空樞紐的實力。

說到實力，雖然大家也很熟悉，但正如行政長官經常勉勵我，好東西不怕多說，所以我也要在大家面前再講一次，亦希望透過傳媒讓市民大眾掌握到我們的實力，因為國際機場是我們的「金漆招牌」，是很多同業多年來的努力。

我首先說說貨運。我們第14年作為全球最繁忙貨運機場的首位，這是得來不易的。即使近來不同傳媒，包括本地或海外傳媒，問及我關於在關稅影響下，對我們的航空航運，以至物流有何影響，其實我想由數字已經看到，首五個月，每月貨運量都非常亮麗，平均達到40萬公噸。我很希望我們今年會很有把握再下一城，當然這需要大家一起努力及支持。

說到客運，我們都很努力，因為疫情後，雖然我們開關比一些機場慢，但復蘇的速度簡直好像火箭那樣快。我們回看首五個月的客運量已經達到2 500萬，而這數字同比增長超過20%，近來單日高峰，大概是復活節期間，達到近20萬人次，每日1 100架次。試想一個這麼繁忙的機場需要多少人手呢？雖然我們現在說科技、無人駕駛，盡量多自動化，但是在機場裏，不只是操作運輸或物流、航空貨運，其實滿載都是人和人之間的關係，所以正正需要吸引多元化的人才。

除了我們「金漆招牌」的數據，另一方面我認為很值得鼓舞是機管局你們的領導，給予社會前瞻性的發展路向，就是發展機場城市SKYTOPIA。SKYTOPIA給予我們發展的契機，尤其對於人才方面，不只管理的崗位，屆時SKYTOPIA是包羅萬有，會有零售、餐飲、文化創意、旅遊、展覽，及各種科技創新、遊艇經濟的項目。以後機場再招聘時，不知道你可以怎樣再增加攤位，最好就是透過科技、動畫，讓大家感受到這簡直是一個很大的發展空間，而吸引的人才都要靠我們大家繼續培育。

很高興見到Simon（香港國際航空學院校長李天柱）今日在場，我們對香港國際航空學院都很期待，希望你們可以訓練、培育，更可以留住人才。但不只是靠你們，政府亦有海運及空運人才培訓基金。透過這個基金，我們希望助力不同培育機構、大學或職業學校的培訓項目，為我們加速培育多方面人才。

即將有一個很開心的項目，就是香港國際航空學院最近與全球首屈一指的飛機拆解和部件公司——就此，我希望日後有更多確實的數字和故事，可以大力宣傳——很開心的是首先就與他們簽署備忘錄，讓年青人看到有新領域可以開拓，亦正正為我們作為香港國際航空樞紐作多元化和深化發展。

剛才Vivian講了很多關於作為在機場島工作的一分子，在全方位、一條龍方面有甚麼配套。除了幼兒服務、運動室、canteen很出名的奶茶及下午茶餐外，我有一項感受特別深、亦是我的弱項，就是運動。我看到這幾年透過你們一條龍的配套設施，訓練了很多體育精英，無論長跑、短跑，甚至是電競。我認為吸引年青人，希望大家能一邊工作、一邊發掘體育潛能，是一個賣點——可能遲些你們再發掘唱歌、跳舞等——各方面都可以幫助大家吸引年青人，最重要是我們給予他們希望及活力。

我們要匯聚人才，不只在機場島，與機場有關的行業是各式各樣，超越了機場島以外的地方。今日我很希望透過職業博覽會接下來三日活動，進一步讓同業互相交流，當然亦很希望有實質成果，就是吸引到有人簽約，亦很希望透過我們的努力——未來一年是辛苦的，會有很多工作給大家機場同業去做，因為大家開拓了這麼多的領域，需要承傳，我們要有年青的一代去接棒。我們亦希望有多元化的人才，豐富我們的思路，令未來發展路向更加豐富、多元和更有活力，以服務香港和國家作為己任。多謝大家。"
明愛醫院公布一宗醫療風險警示事件,2025-06-27 18:40,2025-06-27 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700709.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

明愛醫院發言人今日（六月二十七日）就一宗醫療風險警示事件有以下公布：

一名四十八歲過往健康良好的女病人，在六月十七日因腹痛入住本院外科病房。病人在六月十八日進行腹部電腦掃描造影檢查，報告顯示病人患有早期闌尾炎、輕微結腸炎，右側輸卵管旁有一細小囊腫。

同日晚上，病人獲安排緊急進行手術，由一名正接受進階外科專科訓練的醫生，使用腹腔鏡進行微創闌尾切除手術。在手術進行期間，手術位置曾出現滲血，在處理過程中輸卵管旁囊腫亦出現撕裂情況，主刀醫生即時請示當值的副顧問醫生。該名副顧問醫生隨即到達手術室參與手術。在諮詢瑪嘉烈醫院婦產科醫生意見後，確認成功止血後毋須把囊腫切除。病人在完成手術後情況穩定，繼續留院接受觀察及治療；而被切除的組織亦送交病理部進行病理化驗。

六月二十三日下午，病人出現低燒並腹痛加劇，隨後醫生安排病人再次進行腹部電腦掃描造影檢查，報告顯示闌尾仍然存在；而於六月二十五日傍晚發出的病理化驗報告顯示日前被切的組織為輸卵管，而非闌尾。

本院非常關注事件，翌日（六月二十六日）早上馬上向病人及家屬解釋事件和表達衷心歉意，隨即安排為病人切除發炎的闌尾。手術順利完成，醫護團隊會持續密切監察病人術後的康復進度。

初步調查懷疑由於手術部位附近一帶有組織粘連，導致醫生把輸卵管誤認為闌尾。

明愛醫院對病人再次表達衷心歉意，已要求外科部門重新檢視有關腹腔鏡手術的安排及處理，包括人手安排、工作分配及督導指引，加強對前線醫護人員的培訓，確保妥善處理手術相關的各項細節，以保障病人安全。

院方已透過早期事故通報系統向醫院管理局總辦事處通報事件，並會成立根源分析委員會作詳細調查，於八星期內完成報告並提出改善建議。

根源分析委員會成員名單如下︰

Revised arrangements under Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme to be implemented starting tomorrow,2025-06-27 18:05,2025-06-27 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700682.htm,"The Social Welfare Department (SWD) announced today (June 27) that it will implement revised arrangements under the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme starting from tomorrow (June 28), in which Injury Grant and Interim Maintenance Grant of the Scheme will be merged into Compassionate Grant (CG).

An applicant eligible for CG will receive $330 per day for a maximum of 60 days of sick leave. Subject to meeting other relevant eligibility criteria, a CG applicant must obtain certification from a registered medical practitioner (including a registered Chinese medicine practitioner) that his/her injury requires hospitalisation for no less than seven days or sick leave for at least seven days. An applicant can only apply for CG once within two years. The SWD will adjust the assistance amount of CG annually in accordance with the established mechanism.

An SWD spokesman said that the Government has no intention to alter the original policy intent of the Scheme. The revised arrangements, approved by the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council today, aim to enhance the Scheme so that it can provide modest but timely relief to victims of traffic accidents in a sustainable manner, help victims overcome short-term financial difficulties, ensure proper use of public resources, and prevent abuse and fraudulent behaviour. For persons with financial difficulties or other welfare needs, the SWD will provide them with appropriate support, including referring them to apply for the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance or other assistance.

The revised arrangements will apply to the applications involving traffic accidents that happened at or after 00.00 hours tomorrow. Victims of traffic accidents that happened before 00.00 hours on June 28, 2025, can still apply for Injury Grant and Interim Maintenance Grant under the Scheme, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility criteria.

The arrangements for the other three grants under the Scheme, namely Burial Grant, Death Grant and Disability Grant, will remain unchanged.

Details of the Scheme are available on the SWD's website (www.swd.gov.hk/en/pubsvc/socsecu/trafficacc)."

海關人員於五月二日在香港國際機場截查一名二十八歲抵港女旅客，並在她攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約二十一公斤未完稅雪茄，市值約二十四萬六千元，應課稅值約九萬元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買未完稅煙草，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

Customs officers intercepted a 28-year-old incoming female passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on May 2. About 21 kilograms of duty-not-paid cigars, with an estimated market value of about $246,000 and a duty potential of about $90,000 in total, were seized from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys duty-not-paid tobacco commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

EDB and SCOLAR organise Closing cum Award Presentation Ceremony of Biliteracy and Trilingualism Campaign 2025,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700247.htm,"The Education Bureau (EDB) and the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR) held the Closing cum Award Presentation Ceremony of the Biliteracy and Trilingualism Campaign 2025 today (June 27) to celebrate the success of activities in promoting biliteracy and trilingualism across various sectors of society over the past six months.

Officiating at the ceremony, the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said in her speech that Hong Kong, as an international metropolis where East meets West, requires a large pool of biliterate and trilingual talent to demonstrate its important role as a ""super connector"". This is also crucial to consolidating its status as an international education hub in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. She emphasised that mastering biliteracy and trilingualism is essential for realising Hong Kong's development of the ""eight centres"" as outlined in the National 14th Five-Year Plan, and for seizing opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Under ""one country, two systems"", biliteracy and trilingualism stands as one of the advantages of education in Hong Kong.

She said that over the years, the EDB and SCOLAR have been working together to promote biliteracy and trilingualism. Measures introduced in recent years include encouraging teachers to improve their Putonghua proficiency by utilising the Language Fund to sponsor them to take the Putonghua Proficiency Test. In addition, a one-off grant has been provided to schools for implementing the promotion of self-directed language learning (English and Putonghua) initiative, helping students to enhance their self-directed learning capabilities and biliterate and trilingual skills. It is hoped that, through collective efforts, the Campaign will strengthen Hong Kong's language and talent capital, enabling the city to leverage its advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world.

At the ceremony, the Chairperson of SCOLAR, Dr Anissa Chan, expressed gratitude to the Biliteracy and Trilingualism Campaign 2025 Ambassador, Hins Cheung, and organisations and individuals from various sectors for their support, which contributed to the success of the Campaign. She particularly thanked Hins Cheung and individuals from diverse professional fields for sharing language-learning insights and personal experiences through short videos, illustrating how their biliterate and trilingual abilities have played a crucial role in their personal and career development. She also thanked community partners for organising engaging and meaningful competitions and activities, schools for enthusiastically participating in the One-minute Video Production Competition, and partners from the education sector and various industries for their assistance in producing the videos to promote biliteracy and trilingualism.

Dr Chan pointed out that the Student Language Ambassadors will play a key role in enhancing language proficiency in the community. SCOLAR, in partnership with the EDB, programme partners and key industries, will continue to promote language learning with a view to enhancing the language abilities of Hong Kong citizens.

Awards of the One-minute Video Production Competition were presented at the ceremony. The award-winning works, produced by students, integrated vibrant creative elements, showcasing their proficiency in biliteracy and trilingualism. They effectively promote Hong Kong's position as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange and as an international educational hub.

Community partners, including the Methodist Epworth Village Community Centre Social Welfare, the Smart Education Charitable Foundation and the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, invited winners of their respective activities and competitions to perform or share insights at the ceremony. Their performances were engaging and rich in content. Students demonstrated outstanding language skills and mastery of biliteracy and trilingualism. The vibrant atmosphere infused the ceremony with joy and dynamism, marking a successful conclusion to the Campaign.

FSTB and SFC launch consultation on legislative proposals for regulating digital asset dealing and custodian services,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700385.htm,"  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today (June 27) launched a joint public consultation on the legislative proposals for establishing licensing regimes for digital asset (DA) (referred to as ""virtual asset"" in the consultation document) (Note) dealing and custodian service providers. The public consultation will last for two months until August 29, 2025.

  To promote the sustainable development of Hong Kong's DA ecosystem while protecting investors and managing risks, the Government and financial regulators have been closely monitoring market developments and maintaining dialogue with industry stakeholders to continuously review and enhance Hong Kong's regulatory framework for DA activities.

  In this regard, the FSTB conducted a public consultation between February and April last year on the legislative proposals for establishing a licensing regime for DA over-the-counter service providers. Based on the feedback received, the FSTB, in collaboration with the SFC, has revised the legislative proposals. By launching the public consultation today, the FSTB and the SFC seek to gather views from stakeholders on the framework and key elements of the revised legislative proposals.

  The revised legislative proposals cover the licensing regime for DA dealing service providers and the licensing regime for DA custodian service providers. Under the two proposed licensing regimes, the SFC will be the standard setter, responsible for formulating regulatory requirements applicable to licensed and registered DA dealing and custodian service providers.Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will be the frontline regulator for banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) registered to provide the relevant services. Both the SFC and the HKMA will be provided with the powers to implement the regimes in accordance with the statutory requirements.

  The key elements of the proposed licensing regimes are as follows:

(1) Licensing Regime for DA Dealing Service Providers

* Any person who carries on a business of providing DA dealing services in Hong Kong will have to be licensed by or registered with the SFC;

*Irrespective of whether the relevant DA dealing services are provided through a physical outlet and/or other platforms, both simple dealing services (e.g. smaller-scale conversions between different DAs or between DAs and fiat money) and more complex services (e.g. brokerage activities, block trading activities, and other activities of advisors or asset managers) will fall under the scope of the licensing regime;

*Licensed or registered providers of DA dealing services will need to meet fit-and-proper criteria and comply with a range of regulatory requirements, including those related to financial resources, knowledge and experience, risk management, financial reporting and disclosure, conduct of business, information and notifications, record keeping, proper protection of client assets, and investor protection safeguards; and

*The licensing regime will be fully implemented on the date the relevant statutory provisions come into effect, with no deeming arrangement.

(2) Licensing Regime for DA Custodian Service Providers

*Any person carrying on a business in Hong Kong of providing DA custodian services will have to be licensed by or registered with the SFC. The provision of DA custodian services as a business will be defined as - by way of business, the safekeeping of (i) DAs on behalf of clients; or (ii) instruments enabling transfer of DAs of clients (including but not limited to private keys) on behalf of clients; and

*Same as DA dealing services, licensed or registered providers of DA custodian services will need to meet fit-and-proper criteria and comply with a range of regulatory requirements, including those related to proper protection of client assets, financial resources, knowledge and experience, risk management, financial reporting and disclosure, conduct of business, information and notifications, and record keeping. Similarly, the licensing regime will be fully implemented on the date the relevant statutory provisions come into effect, with no deeming arrangement.

  The consultation papers are available on the webpages of the FSTB and the SFC:

*Licensing Regime for DA Dealing Service Providers (www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/en/publication/consult/doc/VADEALING_consultation_paper_en.pdf / apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/consultation/doc?refNo=25CP6)

*Licensing Regime for DA Custodian Service Providers (www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/en/publication/consult/doc/VACUSTODY_consultation_paper_en.pdf/ apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/consultation/doc?refNo=25CP7)

  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""We have the public consultation on the establishment of licensing regimes for DA dealing and custodian service providers launched today, right after our release of the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong yesterday. By this, we want to deliver an important message to the public that while we are striving to build Hong Kong into a premier global hub for DAs, upholding investor protection is still our utmost concern. The proposed licensing regimes will lay a solid foundation for us to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for DAs with investor and customer protection at its core. The move will also help realise our vision to build Hong Kong's DA ecosystem into a highly trusted one that will flourish sustainably and responsibly in a risk-managed manner, thereby delivering concrete benefits to the real economy and financial markets.""

  The Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Ms Julia Leung, said, ""The proposed introduction of the regulatory regimes for dealers and custodians would complete a digital asset ecosystem that is both safe and vibrant for institutional and retail investors. In balancing industry growth with robust investor protection, we join hands with the Hong Kong SAR Government to build Hong Kong into a trusted and sustainable platform that taps into global liquidity. We will also stay committed to close collaboration with our industry stakeholders to broaden participation and further raise the vibrancy of Hong Kong's ecosystem.""

  The FSTB and the SFC welcome views from the public and stakeholders on the proposed licensing regimes. Submissions should be sent by post (24/F, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong) or by email to the FSTB on or before August 29, 2025:

* Licensing Regime for DA Trading Service Providers: vadealing-consult@fstb.gov.hk
* Licensing Regime for DA Custodian Service Providers: vacustody-consult@fstb.gov.hk

  During the consultation period, the FSTB and the SFC will also meet with relevant sectors to gather feedback.

Note: The term ""digital asset"" includes ""virtual asset"". As ""virtual asset"" is a legally defined term under the existing Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615), the term ""virtual asset"" is still adopted in the consultation papers in this public consultation. The Government will review whether another term should be used in the legislation in lieu of ""virtual asset"" so as to better reflect the nature of this asset class, and align with the understanding across international markets.

​衞生防護中心調查一宗與早前群組個案有關連的麻疹個案,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700631.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（六月二十七日）正調查一宗麻疹個案，並提醒市民接種疫苗是預防麻疹的最有效方法。

個案涉及一名29歲女子，是中心日前公布兩宗有流行病學關連麻疹個案的家人。中心進行接觸者追蹤時，發現早前確診感染麻疹的一名六個月大男嬰的母親約於六月九日出現喉嚨痛，其後並出現咳嗽和短暫發燒，遂安排她到廣華醫院接受檢測。病人的血液樣本經檢測後，證實對麻疹病毒抗體呈陽性反應。她目前已康復。

流行病學調查顯示，女病人未能確定曾否接種麻疹疫苗。中心會繼續調查上述三宗有流行病學關連的麻疹個案，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查未發現這三宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「麻疹的潛伏期（即由感染後到發病的時間）為七至21日。麻疹病徵包括發燒、皮膚出現紅疹、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼紅等。當出現相關病徵，市民應戴上外科口罩，停止上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方和避免與未有免疫力人士接觸，尤其是抵抗力弱人士、孕婦及未滿一歲的兒童。懷疑受感染的人士應盡早向醫生求診及告知醫護人員有麻疹接觸史。」

他續說：「在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下，透過衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院及學童免疫注射小組提供的免疫接種服務，本港整體免疫接種覆蓋率一直維持在非常高水平。根據小學學童的免疫接種覆蓋率及衞生署定期進行全港免疫接種覆蓋調查顯示，兩劑麻疹疫苗接種的整體覆蓋率一直維持在95%以上，而本地麻疹病毒抗體的血清陽性率反映絕大部分香港市民對麻疹已有免疫力。然而，香港作為國際旅遊頻繁的城市，仍面對輸入麻疹病毒及其在本地社區進一步傳播的潛在風險。少數未完成接種麻疹疫苗的人士（例如非本地出生人士，包括新移民、外傭、海外僱員及來港升學人士）仍有機會受感染，並把麻疹傳播給其他未具備麻疹免疫力人士，例如一歲以下尚未接種第一劑麻疹疫苗的幼兒。」

在一九六七年前出生的市民，由於當時麻疹在全球多個地方及香港仍屬風土病，故可視為透過自然感染而對麻疹具備免疫力。一九六七年或以後出生而尚未完成接種兩劑麻疹疫苗或對麻疹疫苗接種史不詳的人士，應盡快諮詢家庭醫生以完成接種，以確保市民對麻疹有足夠保護力。

今年部分海外國家的麻疹個案維持在高水平，其中北美洲（包括美國及加拿大）、歐洲及鄰近地區（包括越南、柬埔寨和菲律賓），因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低而出現麻疹持續爆發。另外，日本和澳洲今年錄得的麻疹個案亦有所上升。因此，計劃前往麻疹流行地區的市民，應及早檢視自己的疫苗接種紀錄及病歷，若以往未經化驗確診感染麻疹，以及從未或不確定曾否接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，應在出發前最少兩星期諮詢醫生接種疫苗。

除接種麻疹疫苗外，市民應採取以下措施預防感染麻疹：

• 維持良好的個人及環境衞生；
•保持室內空氣流通；
•保持雙手清潔，並用正確的方法洗手；
•雙手被呼吸系統分泌物弄污後（如打噴嚏後）應立即洗手；
•打噴嚏或咳嗽時要掩着口鼻，並妥善清理口鼻排出的分泌物；
•徹底清潔用過的玩具和家具；及
•病患者在出疹後的四日內不應上學，避免將疾病傳染給未有免疫力的人。

CHP investigates measles infection case epidemiologically linked to earlier cluster,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700678.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (June 27) is investigating a case of measles infection and reminded the public that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles.

The case involved a 29-year-old female who is a family member of the two epidemiologically linked measles infection cases announced by the CHP recently. During the contact tracing, the CHP found that the mother of the six-month-old baby boy, who had been infected with measles earlier, developed a sore throat around June 9. She later developed a cough and transient fever. The CHP arranged for her to attend Kwong Wah Hospital for testing. Her blood sample tested positive for antibodies of measles virus upon laboratory testing. She has recovered now.

An epidemiological investigation revealed that the female patient was not certain whether she had ever received measles vaccination.The CHP continues to investigate the cases to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that no epidemiological linkages have been established between these three cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

""The incubation period of measles (i.e. the time from infection to onset of illness) is seven to 21 days. Symptoms include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. When such symptoms appear, people should wear surgical masks, stay home from work or school, avoid crowded places and contact with unvaccinated people, especially those with weak immune systems, pregnant women and children under 1 year old. Those who suspect they are infected should consult their doctors as soon as possible and inform healthcare workers of their history of exposure to measles,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""Under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, the overall immunisation coverage in Hong Kong has been maintained at a very high level through the immunisation services provided by the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres and School Immunisation Teams. As evidenced by the findings on vaccination coverage of primary school students and the territory-wide immunisation surveys conducted regularly by the DH, the two-dose measles vaccination coverage has remained consistently high, well above 95 per cent, and the local seroprevalence rates of measles virus antibodies reflect that most people in Hong Kong are immune to measles. However, Hong Kong, as a city with a high volume of international travel, still faces the potential risk of importation of the measles virus and its further spread in the local community. Hence, a small number of people who have not completed a measles vaccination (such as non-local-born people including new immigrants, foreign domestic helpers, overseas employees and people coming to Hong Kong for further studies) are still at risk of being infected and spreading measles to other people who do not have immunity against measles, such as children under 1 year old who have not yet received the first dose of the measles vaccine,"" he added.

People born before 1967 could be considered to have acquired immunity to measles through natural infection, as measles was endemic in many parts of the world and in Hong Kong at that time. People born in or after 1967 who have not yet completed the two doses of measles vaccination or whose measles vaccination history is unknown, should consult their family doctors as soon as possible to complete the vaccination and ensure adequate protection against measles.

The number of measles cases in some overseas countries remains at a high level this year. The outbreaks in North America (including the United States and Canada), Europe and neighbouring areas (including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines) are ongoing due to the relatively low vaccination rate. Furthermore, an increasing number of measles cases have also been recorded in Japan and Australia this year. For those who plan to travel to measles-endemic areas, they should check their vaccination records and medical history as early as possible. If they have not been diagnosed with measles through laboratory tests and have never received two doses of measles vaccine or are not sure if they have received a measles vaccine, they should consult a doctor at least two weeks prior to their trip for vaccination.

Besides being vaccinated against measles, members of the public should take the following measures to prevent infection:


Maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
Keep hands clean and wash hands properly;
Wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharge properly;
Clean used toys and furniture properly; and
Persons with measles should be kept out of school till four days from the appearance of a rash to prevent the spread of the infection to non-immune persons in school.

​財庫局和證監會就規管數字資產交易及託管服務的立法建議進行諮詢,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700368.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）今日（六月二十七日）就設立數字資產（即諮詢文件內所指的「虛擬資產」）（註）交易和託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議，展開聯合公眾諮詢。公眾諮詢為期兩個月至二○二五年八月二十九日為止。

為保障投資者和管控風險，並同時促進香港數字資產生態圈的可持續發展，政府與金融監管機構一直密切留意市場的發展情況，並與業界緊密溝通，以持續檢視和優化香港對數字資產活動的規管框架。

就此，財庫局在去年二月至四月就數字資產場外交易服務提供者設立發牌制度的立法建議進行公眾諮詢。因應收集到的意見，財庫局聯同證監會調整了立法建議，並藉今日展開的公眾諮詢，就其框架和主要內容收集各持份者的意見。

經調整的立法建議涵蓋數字資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度，以及數字資產託管服務提供者的發牌制度。在擬議的兩個發牌制度下，證監會將擔當標準制訂者，負責制訂適用於持牌和註冊數字資產交易和託管服務提供者的規管要求，而香港金融管理局（金管局）則會擔當前線監管機構，監管已註冊為可提供相關服務的銀行及儲值支付工具。證監會和金管局會獲賦權，以根據法定要求實施該制度。

擬議的發牌制度重點如下：

（一）數字資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度

＊任何人如在香港從事提供數字資產交易服務的業務，須獲證監會發牌或註冊；

＊不論有關的數字資產交易服務是透過實體店及／或其他平台提供，其涵蓋範圍均包括：簡單的交易服務（例如規模較小、涉及不同數字資產之間的兌換服務；以及數字資產與法定貨幣之間的兌換服務），以及較複雜的服務（例如經紀活動、大宗交易活動，以至顧問或資產管理人從事的其他活動）；

＊提供數字資產交易服務的持牌人或註冊人需要符合適當人選的評定準則，以及一系列的規管要求，包括：財政資源、知識和經驗、風險管理、財務匯報和披露、業務操守、資料及通知、備存記錄、妥善保障客戶資產和保障投資者的措施等；及

＊發牌制度將於相關法律條文生效當日全面實施，不設「被當作已獲發牌」的安排。

（二）數字資產託管服務提供者的發牌制度

＊任何人如在香港經營提供數字資產託管服務的業務，須獲證監會發牌或註冊。提供數字資產託管服務的業務的定義是，以業務形式代客戶保管（i）數字資產；或（ii）能轉移客戶數字資產的工具，包括但不限於私人密鑰；及

＊與數字資產交易服務一樣，經營提供數字資產託管服務的業務的持牌人或註冊人需要符合適當人選的評定準則，以及一系列的規管要求，包括：妥善保障客戶資產、財政資源、知識和經驗、風險管理、財務匯報和披露、業務操守、資料及通知，和備存記錄等。同樣，發牌制度會在相關法律條文生效當日全面實施，不設「被當作已獲發牌」的安排。

諮詢文件已上載至財庫局和證監會的網頁：

＊數字資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度（www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/tc/publication/consult/doc/VADEALING_consultation_paper_tc.pdf ／apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/TC/consultation/doc?refNo=25CP6）

財庫局局長許正宇表示：「我們昨日剛發表了《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》，今日隨即便就設立數字資產交易和託管服務提供者發牌制度展開公眾諮詢，正正是要向公眾傳達一個重要的信息，那就是我們在全力建設香港成為全球領先數字資產中心的同時，也必定會為投資者提供充分保障。擬議的發牌制度可為我們提供穩固並以投資者和消費者保障為核心的基礎去構建全面的數字資產規管框架。此舉將貫徹我們致力讓香港的數字資產生態圈在一個風險可控的環境下持續及負責任地蓬勃發展的理念，從而以高巿場可信度為本港的實體經濟和金融巿場帶來實質效益。」

證監會行政總裁梁鳳儀表示：「是次就交易服務和託管服務提供者引入監管制度的建議，將能構建完整的數字資產生態系統，對於機構與零售投資者來說，這系統既安全可靠又活力充沛。為平衡行業發展和穩健的投資者保障，本會與香港特別行政區政府攜手合作，致力將香港打造成一可靠、可持續發展且結合全球流動性的平台。我們亦會與業界持份者竭力保持緊密合作，以擴大市場參與，使香港的市場生態得以更蓬勃地發展。」

財庫局和證監會歡迎公眾及持份者就擬議的發牌制度提供意見，並於二○二五年八月二十九日或以前透過郵遞（香港添馬添美道2號政府總部24樓）或電郵方式將意見送交財庫局：
＊數字資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度：vadealing-consult@fstb.gov.hk
＊數字資產託管服務提供者的發牌制度：vacustody-consult@fstb.gov.hk

財庫局和證監會在諮詢期間也會與相關業界會面，收集意見。

註：「數字資產」一詞包含「虛擬資產」。由於「虛擬資產」一詞在現行的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》（第615章）中有其法律定義，因此是次公眾諮詢的諮詢文件會沿用「虛擬資產」一詞，但政府將檢視在法例上應否使用其他詞語取代「虛擬資產」以更好反映此資產類別的性質，並與國際市場的理解保持一致。

EDB and SCOLAR organise Closing cum Award Presentation Ceremony of Biliteracy and Trilingualism Campaign 2025 (with photos),2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700247.htm,"The Education Bureau (EDB) and the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR) held the Closing cum Award Presentation Ceremony of the Biliteracy and Trilingualism Campaign 2025 today (June 27) to celebrate the success of activities in promoting biliteracy and trilingualism across various sectors of society over the past six months.

Officiating at the ceremony, the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said in her speech that Hong Kong, as an international metropolis where East meets West, requires a large pool of biliterate and trilingual talent to demonstrate its important role as a ""super connector"". This is also crucial to consolidating its status as an international education hub in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. She emphasised that mastering biliteracy and trilingualism is essential for realising Hong Kong's development of the ""eight centres"" as outlined in the National 14th Five-Year Plan, and for seizing opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Under ""one country, two systems"", biliteracy and trilingualism stands as one of the advantages of education in Hong Kong.

She said that over the years, the EDB and SCOLAR have been working together to promote biliteracy and trilingualism. Measures introduced in recent years include encouraging teachers to improve their Putonghua proficiency by utilising the Language Fund to sponsor them to take the Putonghua Proficiency Test. In addition, a one-off grant has been provided to schools for implementing the promotion of self-directed language learning (English and Putonghua) initiative, helping students to enhance their self-directed learning capabilities and biliterate and trilingual skills. It is hoped that, through collective efforts, the Campaign will strengthen Hong Kong's language and talent capital, enabling the city to leverage its advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world.

At the ceremony, the Chairperson of SCOLAR, Dr Anissa Chan, expressed gratitude to the Biliteracy and Trilingualism Campaign 2025 Ambassador, Hins Cheung, and organisations and individuals from various sectors for their support, which contributed to the success of the Campaign. She particularly thanked Hins Cheung and individuals from diverse professional fields for sharing language-learning insights and personal experiences through short videos, illustrating how their biliterate and trilingual abilities have played a crucial role in their personal and career development. She also thanked community partners for organising engaging and meaningful competitions and activities, schools for enthusiastically participating in the One-minute Video Production Competition, and partners from the education sector and various industries for their assistance in producing the videos to promote biliteracy and trilingualism.

Dr Chan pointed out that the Student Language Ambassadors will play a key role in enhancing language proficiency in the community. SCOLAR, in partnership with the EDB, programme partners and key industries, will continue to promote language learning with a view to enhancing the language abilities of Hong Kong citizens.

Awards of the One-minute Video Production Competition were presented at the ceremony. The award-winning works, produced by students, integrated vibrant creative elements, showcasing their proficiency in biliteracy and trilingualism. They effectively promote Hong Kong's position as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange and as an international educational hub.

Community partners, including the Methodist Epworth Village Community Centre Social Welfare, the Smart Education Charitable Foundation and the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, invited winners of their respective activities and competitions to perform or share insights at the ceremony. Their performances were engaging and rich in content. Students demonstrated outstanding language skills and mastery of biliteracy and trilingualism. The vibrant atmosphere infused the ceremony with joy and dynamism, marking a successful conclusion to the Campaign.

The ceremony was held at the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups Building, with around 400 attendees, including guests from the business sector, arts and cultural sector, and community organisations, as well as teachers, parents and students.

在典禮上，語常會主席陳黃麗娟博士感謝2025年「兩文三語運動大使」張敬軒、各方機構和各界人士的支持，令「兩文三語運動2025」圓滿成功。她特別感謝張敬軒及來自不同界別的人士透過短片分享學習語言的心得與個人經歷，展現兩文三語如何在個人和職業發展中發揮關鍵作用。她亦感謝社區合作夥伴推出既引人入勝又別具意義的比賽和活動、各校積極參與「一分鐘短片製作比賽」，以及教育界和各行各業的合作夥伴在製作兩文三語宣傳短片上的協助。

陳黃麗娟博士指出，學生語文大使將在推動提升社區語言能力方面擔當重要角色。語常會將繼續與教育局、合作夥伴及重點行業攜手推動語言學習，致力提升香港市民的語言能力。

在典禮上，大會頒發了「一分鐘短片製作比賽」的獎項。得獎作品由學生精心製作，融入充滿活力的創意元素，充分展現其兩文三語的能力，並有效推廣香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心和國際教育樞紐的角色。

一眾社區合作夥伴，包括循道愛華村服務中心社會福利部、聰穎教育慈善基金及香港教育工作者聯會，邀請活動優勝者在典禮上表演或分享。有關內容豐富有趣，學生展現了出色的語言能力，充分體現運用兩文三語的精髓，熱烈氣氛為典禮增添喜悅與活力，亦為「兩文三語運動2025」畫上圓滿句號。

閉幕暨頒獎典禮在香港青年協會大廈舉行，約400位來自商界、文化藝術界、社區團體的嘉賓，以及老師、家長和學生出席。有關典禮及「兩文三語運動2025」的詳情，可瀏覽語常會網頁（scolarhk.edb.hkedcity.net/tc/Biliteracy_and_Trilingualism_Campaign），或語常會的社交媒體專頁。"

尊敬的喬局長（國家文物局副局長喬雲飛）、王秘書長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室秘書長王松苗）、各位嘉賓、各位媒體朋友：

大家好！首先，歡迎各位參加「唐風萬里：多元交融開放的盛世」展覽的開幕典禮。這次展覽是香港特區政府發展局與國家文物局在二○二二年簽訂框架協議書（《關於深化文化遺產領域交流與合作的框架協議書》）後，第六個共同策劃的文物展覽，這次展覽無論在規格、規模和文物展品的數量上，都是歷次合辦展覽之冠，標示着發展局和國家文物局的合作邁向更高的台階。

唐朝是中國歷史上最輝煌的朝代之一，長安城內萬邦來朝，陸上和海上絲綢之路商旅絡繹不絕。大唐以開放包容的胸襟，架起東西方文明對話的橋樑，展現了和平共榮的繁華氣象。而在長安城外，遠在南方，當時的香港其實已是國家對外交流的重要門戶，也是海上絲綢之路的關鍵節點，曾經出土不少珍貴的唐代文物。今年香港回歸祖國二十八周年，七月一日很快就到了，我們特別以這個展覽作為慶祝活動之一，與香港市民、各地訪客共同體會中華文明兼容並蓄的優點，以及唐代繁華盛世所產生的文化藝術瑰寶。

去年，為紀念中國與法國建交六十周年，國家文物局與法國吉美國立亞洲藝術博物館合辦了一個展覽，名為「中國．唐——一個多元開放的朝代（七至十世紀）」。今天，我們在香港開幕的這個展覽就是以這個深受歡迎的國際展覽為基礎。

這次展覽匯聚了內地十個省、市、自治區的28家文博機構的珍貴藏品，再加上香港發展局古物古蹟辦事處收藏的出土文物，合共展出約300項展品，包括49項一級文物和29件香港唐代重要出土文物。展覽有八個單元，透過文物展現唐代的政治體制、長安城的國際都會風采、老百姓多姿多彩的生活、宗教思想、文人的風雅生活、登峰造極的工藝、陸上與海上絲綢之路的繁盛景象；而最後一個單元就展示香港作為唐代海上絲綢之路節點。

「唐風萬里」展覽能夠順利舉行，我衷心感謝國家文物局、中國文化交流中心，以及內地與香港多個政府機關、文博單位的通力支持與合作。香港是中外文化藝術交流中心，我殷切期待我們在香港舉辦「唐風萬里」展覽，可以把巍巍唐風展現給香港市民，以及來自萬里各地的朋友。

最後，我祝願展覽圓滿成功，各位參訪的朋友有愉快、難忘的經驗。謝謝大家。"

Government receives investigation reports on recent railway incidents and action plan from MTRCL,2025-06-27 17:05,2025-06-27 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700592.htm,"âIn relation to three railwayincidents this year, namely the East Rail Line(EAL) engineering train incidents on February 5 and April 27, and the Tseung Kwan O Line (TKL) incident on May 22, the Government has instructed the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to strengthen the maintenance of its railway system and incident handling capacity to enhance the overall resilience of the railway network. The Government received detailed investigation reports from the MTRCL on the EAL incident and TKL incident on May 27 and June 21 respectively.

At the Government's request, the MTRCL has also formulated an action plan on incident prevention and handling (attached to the TKL incident investigation report). The plan covers a one-off special inspection of targeted critical assets and a series of mid- to long-term measures. They include strengthening the monitoring and risk management of railway assets to enhance the overall resilience of the railway network; formulating plans for extreme scenarios, reinforcing drills and trainings under different scenarios, strengthening the decision-making and execution capacities of MTR staff during incidents; and enhancing free shuttle bus arrangements and strengthening information dissemination such as updates on repair work progress, suggestions on alternative routes to facilitate the public in planning their journey according to the latest situation, and rallying community support to assist affected passengers.

The Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, said, ""The MTR is the major mode of transportation for Hong Kong people. The MTRCL must proactively address potential issues before they arise, enhance the safety of its railway systems and accelerate the application of innovative technologies to realise predictive maintenance for fortifying the overall resilience of the railway system. I look forward to the continued effort of the MTRCL management in motivating staff at all levels to work together to implement the measures set out in the action plan. The management should also leverage the wisdom of frontline staff and strengthen the sense of accountability of staff from different ranks.""

The MTRCL completed a comprehensive review of its railway asset management and maintenance regime in June 2023, which sought to strengthen its railway asset management and maintenance regime in five major action areas. The Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB), the Transport Department (TD) and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) will continue to closely monitor the progress, implementation and effectiveness of various follow-up actions taken by the MTRCL. The Government will continue to supervise and guide the MTRCL to learn from the experiences of recent incidents, accelerate the application of innovative technologies to achieve data-driven asset management and strengthen risk prediction and mitigation.

The TLB, the TD and the EMSD will also closely monitor the MTRCL in implementing the improvement measures set out in the investigation reports of the three incidents to ensure that the MTR will continue to provide safe and reliable services to the public."

The Co-operation Arrangement aims to promote exchange and collaboration in medicinal plant cultivation techniques and germplasm resource sharing, as well as the promotion of medicinal plants, jointly advancing the modernisation and internationalisation of Chinese medicines.

The Co-operation Arrangement will enhance collaboration between the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI) of the DH and Guangxi Garden in establishing a medicinal plant garden, exchanging medicinal plant germplasm resources, strengthening technical exchanges, and training talent. Guangxi and Hong Kong will leverage their strengths and characteristics in medicinal plants to create synergy and a win-win situation, promoting the all-round, high-quality and high-level development of the traditional Chinese medicine industry in the country. This will also help to inject new momentum into the high-quality development of Chinese medicines.

The Guangxi Garden was verified by Guinness World Records in 2011 for being the ""largest medicinal herb garden"" with the most plant varieties and the largest cultivating area. It is also a research institution that specialises in the collection, conservation, research and development of medicinal resources, and has achieved remarkable accomplishments in the conservation and innovative application of Chinese medicines resources.

The GCMTI is committed to developing a set of internationally recognised reference standards for Chinese medicines and related products. It empowers the industry through technology transfer to strengthen quality control of their products. Moreover, it has long been promoting the development of Chinese medicines in collaboration with institutions on the Mainland to deepen exchanges and co-operation in the field of Chinese medicines testing and reference standards.
â
The permanent premises of the GCMTI will be commissioned in phases starting from the end of this year, which will further advance innovative research in Chinese medicines. An outdoor medicinal plant garden will be featured therein, which will be open to the public, industry and research institutions. The Co-operation Arrangement will allow Hong Kong to tap into the experience of the Mainland, thus enhancing cultivation techniques and enriching the germplasm resources of the medicinal plant garden. With the establishment of the medicinal plant garden, the GCMTI will upstream and extend its research to cover medicinal plants, in addition to research on quality control of Chinese Materia Medica and proprietary Chinese medicines. Furthermore, the medicinal plant garden will become a base for promoting Chinese medicines culture, and fostering Chinese medicines culture in Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area and the world."

Research Grants Council announces funding results of General Research Fund and Early Career Scheme 2025/26,2025-06-27 17:00,2025-06-27 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700274.htm,"âThe following is issued on behalf of the University Grants Committee:

The Research Grants Council (RGC) today (June 27) announced the funding results of the General Research Fund (GRF) and the Early Career Scheme (ECS) for 2025/26. Altogether, 1 359 proposals were successfully granted a funding of $1.18 billion in total.

In this round of the exercise, the RGC received 3 844 GRF and 594 ECS applications from academic staff of the eight universities funded by the University Grants Committee. This represents an overall increase of about 7 per cent as compared with that of last round.

After rigorous international peer reviews, 1 164 GRF projects were approved with grants amounting to around $1.043 billion. This represents an increase of about 11 per cent in terms of funded projects as compared to the last round. The overall success rate of about 30 per cent is the same as that of last year. The funded proposals cover all disciplines of business studies, biology and medicine, engineering, humanities and social sciences, and physical sciences.

The RGC also funded 195 ECS projects with a total amount of around $139 million, and an overall success rate of about 33 per cent, which is the same as that of last year.

The RGC Subject Panels were delighted to note the high quality of research proposals submitted under the GRF and the ECS. The funded projects have displayed thoughtful research design and greater attention to societal impact. The research undertaken in Hong Kong is found to be internationally leading.

The Chairman of the RGC, Professor Timothy W. Tong, said, ""The RGC is committed to supporting excellent and impactful research in Hong Kong. The Council has been stepping up efforts in developing a robust research base with a view to fostering the continuous growth of a thriving Hong Kong research ecosystem.

""The GRF and the ECS are important research funding initiatives in supporting endeavours by individual researchers from all disciplines, and they are fundamental to Hong Kong in building itself as an international hub for research and higher education.""

The RGC has also enhanced its efforts in recent years to support early-stage researchers and nurturing young talent in Hong Kong. Professor Tong said that the significant number of innovative proposals funded by the ECS this year is heartening.

The GRF and the ECS are individual research funding schemes under the RGC. The GRF supplements universities' own research support for researchers who have achieved or have the potential to achieve excellence. The ECS aims to nurture junior academics and prepare them for a career in education and research.

登革熱最新情況,2025-06-27 16:45,2025-06-27 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700600.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（六月二十七日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字。鑑於本地氣溫及雨量隨着夏季來臨會逐漸上升，蚊患情況可能加劇，加上市民在暑假前往登革熱流行地區會較頻繁，因此本地登革熱的風險正在上升。中心總監徐樂堅醫生呼籲市民提高警覺，不論在本地或外遊，應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。

由六月二十日至昨日（六月二十六日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾到新加坡。

截至昨日，今年錄得28宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。二○二三年則錄得62宗外地傳入個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已各錄得超過一萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過2 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得31宗本地病例。其中，中山、江門、廣州和肇慶於六月九日至十五日的一周內錄得八宗本地病例。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

市民如從受登革熱影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。

炎熱多雨的春夏月份（即五至九月）有利蚊子迅速繁殖。市民應繼續恆常的防蚊工作，並採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%＊；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；及
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用。

＊如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺。

Update on dengue fever,2025-06-27 16:45,2025-06-27 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700610.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (June 27) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases. As the local temperature and rainfall are rising gradually with the arrival of summer, the mosquito infestation may aggravate. In addition, members of the public will travel to DF-endemic regions more frequently during the summer holiday. Therefore, the risk of DF in Hong Kong is increasing. The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, urged the public to remain vigilant, and maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel.

  From June 20 to yesterday (June 26), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to Singapore during the incubation period.

As of yesterday, 28 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases. In 2023, 62 imported cases of DF were recorded.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighboring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 10 000 cases so far this year. Singapore also recorded over 2 000 cases. Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 31 local cases so far this year. Among these cases, eight local cases were recorded in Zhongshan, Jiangmen, Guangzhou and Zhaoqing in a week between June 9 and 15.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

  Members of the public returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, seek medical advice promptly and provide travel details to a doctor.

  As mosquitoes breed quickly during hot and rainy spring and summer months (i.e. from May to September), members of the public are reminded to continue with routine mosquito prevention and control work, and take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.


DEET-containing insect repellents are effective and the public should take heed of the tips below:


Read the label instructions carefully first;
Apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
Apply on exposed skin and clothing;
Use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children*;
Apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent; and
Reapply only when needed and follow the instructions.

* For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""Bidders or applicants for the market stalls must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. To allow more people to bid for or select the stalls and increase customer choices by enhancing the diversity in terms of the variety of stalls, there will be a restriction on the number of stalls to be rented in the same market by a single tenant. Any person who is currently a stall tenant is not allowed to bid in the first round of auction for any stall in the same market, and will only be allowed to bid for one stall in the second round of auction or to select one stall in the same market on a first-come, first-served basis. The existing tenants under the new three-year fixed term tenancy scheme (i.e. those persons who became stall tenants through the market open auctions after August 2022) are allowed to bid for a stall in the auction or select a stall on a first-come, first-served basis in the same market, but shall vacate the current stall and return it to the FEHD before the effective date of commencement of the new tenancy agreement.""

Details of the open auctions and the public market stalls concerned (including stalls for open auction at reduced upset prices) have been uploaded to the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/tidy_market/open_auction_coming.html). Details on renting public market stalls on a first-come, first-served basis will be uploaded to the FEHD website after open auctions (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/tidy_market/FCFS/index.html). Interested bidders or applicants may visit the department website or contact the respective District Environmental Hygiene Office."

Official Taxi Fleet Licences to be issued in July to offer quality taxi services to public (with photos),2025-06-27 16:19,2025-06-27 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700536.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) said today (June 27) that official Taxi Fleet Licences are scheduled to be issued to all five taxi fleets in July to enable the fleets to commence services as soon as possible and showcase the quality services provided by the taxi fleets, such that it can build up public confidence in taxi services and mark an important step to enhance service quality and reform the taxi trade.

A spokesman for the TD said, ""The TD issued provisional grants of the Taxi Fleet Licence to five selected operators in end-July 2024. All five fleets have now commenced trial operations, and have provided a total of nearly 120,000 trips to date. The public's feedback on the taxi fleet services has been positive. We have, after careful consideration, decided to adopt a flexible licensing approach to provide the public with an early opportunity to experience high-quality taxi fleet services. Taxi fleets are a new mode of operation. Upon the official launch of the fleets, we believe that through a series of promotions, positive feedback from passengers, benefits for fleet drivers, and the gradual evolvement of the trade's image, more passengers will come to know and use the taxi fleet services. This will, in turn, provide fleet drivers with a more favourable and stable income, which will help attract more taxi drivers to join the fleets and gradually enhance the fleets' capacity.""

The spokesman continued that issuing official taxi fleet licenses enables the TD to effectively oversee the operations and services of the fleets in accordance with licence conditions and requirements, thereby achieving the objective of enhancing and ensuring service quality through the introduction of the taxi fleet regime.

After obtaining the licences, all five fleet operators can officially use about 80 designated taxi fleet stopping places across 13 locations, such as the airport, certain cross-boundary control points and other tourist hotspots to pick up passengers with pre-booked trips. Signage, information plates, and display panels will be erected at these locations. The TD will also distribute leaflets and display posters featuring QR codes for each taxi fleet's online hailing service to facilitate reservations by the public and tourists. The Government will also promote the taxi fleet services to the public and tourists through various channels, including the TD's HKeMobility mobile application, and the networks of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the Airport Authority, and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.

Since July last year, the five selected operators have been conducting gearing-up work with great endeavour, including procuring new vehicles and carrying out modifications, installing in-vehicle safety devices, setting up electronic payment systems, developing and testing online hailing applications and providing training to drivers. Each fleet has also implemented different measures to recruit taxi owners and drivers, such as participating in a one-stop taxi fleet drivers thematic job fair, hosting fleet introduction sessions and recruitment events, organising activities to showcase the new taxi models and providing new fleet management approaches to taxi owners, etc.

The TD has been holding regular meetings with the fleets to actively promote and assist their gearing-up work, while co-ordinating and providing support based on their needs during the preparatory stage. For example, in response to the need of various operators to acquire new models of vehicles for use as fleet taxis, the TD has, on the premise of ensuring road safety, streamlined procedures by introducing batch applications and vehicle examinations, and providing facilitating measures in respect of the vehicle examination arrangements. The TD also opened designated stopping places within the prohibited zones of the two control points on May 30 to facilitate the fleets under trial operation in picking up passengers with pre-booked trips.

After issuing the official Taxi Fleet Licences, the TD will continue to urge fleet operators to proactively recruit taxi owners and drivers in order to achieve the committed fleet size. The TD will also closely monitor the service performances of the fleets to ensure that the service quality meets the public's aspirations."
正式的士車隊牌照七月發出　讓市民體驗優質的士服務（附圖）,2025-06-27 16:18,2025-06-27 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700533.htm,"運輸署今日（六月二十七日）表示，計劃在今年七月內向五支車隊發出正式的士車隊牌照，讓車隊盡快投入服務，向各界展示的士車隊的優質服務，從而加強公眾對的士服務的信心，為提升的士服務質素和改革的士業邁出重要一步。

運輸署發言人表示：「運輸署於二○二四年七月底向五間獲選的營辦商發出的士車隊牌照的暫准通知，全部五支車隊現時已進入試運作的階段，至今累積提供近12萬程車程，公眾對的士車隊服務評價正面。經過審慎考慮後，我們決定採取靈活的發牌安排，讓市民及早體驗優質的的士車隊服務。的士車隊是新的運作模式，當車隊正式投入營運後，透過一系列宣傳、乘客的口碑、車隊司機的得益，以至為業界逐步帶來新氣象，可令更多乘客認識及選用的士車隊服務，為車隊司機帶來更理想和穩定的收入，有助吸引更多的士司機加盟車隊，逐步提升車隊的運力。」

發言人續指，發出正式的士車隊牌照，可讓運輸署按牌照條款及要求，有效監管車隊的營運及服務，達致透過引入的士車隊制度以提升和確保服務質素的目的。

全部五支車隊營辦商在取得牌照後，能正式以車隊名義使用位於機場、部分跨境口岸及其他旅遊熱點等13個地點約80個車隊的士專屬停車位，接載已預約行程的乘客。上述地點屆時會設有指示牌、資訊牌和展示板，運輸署亦會派發單張和張貼海報，展示各的士車隊網約服務的二維碼，方便市民和旅客預約。政府亦會透過不同的宣傳渠道，包括運輸署「香港出行易」流動應用程式，以及旅遊發展局、機場管理局、啟德郵輪碼頭的網絡，向市民和旅客宣傳的士車隊服務。

自去年七月以來，獲選的五個營辦商一直密鑼緊鼓進行籌備工作，包括購買新車及改裝車輛、在車廂內安裝提升駕駛安全的裝置、加設電子支付系統、開發及測試召車程式、為司機提供訓練。各支車隊亦推出不同措施招募車主和司機，例如參與的士車隊司機一站式專題招聘會、接連舉辦多個車隊簡介會和招募活動、為車主舉行活動展示新型的士車款和車隊管理的新模式等。

運輸署一直與各車隊定期會面溝通，積極推動及協助各車隊的籌備工作，並因應他們在籌備期間的需要作出協調及提供協助。措施包括因應各營辦商需添置新型號車輛作為車隊的士，在確保道路安全的大前提下簡化程序，引入批量式申請和驗車，並在驗車安排方面提供便捷措施。運輸署亦在五月三十日起開放兩個口岸禁區內的指定停車位置，便利試行營運的車隊的士接載已預約行程的乘客。

運輸署在簽發正式的士車隊牌照後，會繼續督促各車隊營辦商積極招募車主和司機，以邁向所承諾的車隊規模，並會密切監察車隊的服務表現，確保服務質素切合大眾的要求。"

  Compared with the grading released last week, Discovery Bay Tai Pak Beach and Silver Mine Bay Beach have been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1. Cafeteria New Beach, Cafeteria Old Beach, Deep Water Bay Beach, Golden Beach, Lido Beach and Lower Cheung Sha Beach have been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

Note 1: Lifesaving services are provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department at 21 gazetted beaches, marked with an asterisk (*) above, from June 1. For details, please refer to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's Special Announcement (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/beach/index.html).

Speaking at the reception, the Permanent Representative of the HKSAR of China to the WTO, Miss Winky So, highlighted how the city, from a humble fishing village to a top-notch international trade and financial centre, has reinvented itself time and again to stay vibrant, while holding fast to the policy of free trade and the principles enshrined in the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO.

To the guests, she said, ""we are privileged to stand alongside friends like you, who are not just like-minded champions of free trade, but also guardians of a system that has connected economies and brought stability and prosperity. Together, in good times and in bad times, we are a living testament to what free trade and a rules-based multilateral trading system can offer.""

As a founding member of the WTO, Hong Kong has always been a staunch supporter of the rules-based multilateral trading system. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong participates in the WTO as a separate customs territory in the name of Hong Kong, China.   "

立法會秘書處（秘書處）今日（六月二十七日）發布最新一期《專題快訊》――「建設國際教育樞紐」，扼要介紹香港教育的競爭力、發展國際教育樞紐的獨特優勢，以及政府當局的相關支援措施，並綜述立法會的相關討論和議員建議。

香港作為國際大都會，教育一向高度國際化和多元化，具備優厚潛力成為國際教育樞紐。《專題快訊》羅列了香港教育的多項國際排名，包括為全球唯一擁有五所世界百強大學的城市、教育競爭力位列全球第二，以及香港中學文憑試獲全球逾600所專上院校承認等。《專題快訊》亦扼要闡述香港專上教育的未來發展；「一國兩制」、背靠祖國、聯通世界為香港帶來的優勢；以及建設國際教育樞紐對香港的裨益。

行政長官在《二○二三年施政報告》宣布銳意建設香港成為「國際專上教育樞紐，未來人才搖籃」，並在《二○二四年施政報告》進一步提出打造「留學香港」品牌。為推動香港成為國際專上教育樞紐，吸引更多人才來港，特區政府推出一系列措施，包括提升大學教育資助委員會資助大學錄取非本地學生的限額一倍、增加獎學金名額及宿位、實施非本地畢業生留港就業計劃、加強院校研究資助、推動本地與內地院校合作，以及成立應用科學大學聯盟以提升職業專才教育的地位等。

為支持專上教育的長遠發展，特區政府已啟動在北部都會區建設大學教育城（大學城）的工程計劃，並預計於二○二六年上半年公布「大學城概念發展綱要」。議員建議當局就大學城的規劃與院校溝通；考慮提供稅收和財政優惠，鼓勵院校在大學城建設第二校區；並與產業和科研機構合作，發揮產學研效應，吸引科研人才。

立法會一直關注香港的教育發展並成立小組委員會，向政府當局及專上教育界別提出建議，以期加快建設國際專上教育樞紐。此外，立法會已完成審議並通過《二○二五年專上學院（修訂）條例草案》，完善自資專上院校的監管和質素保證機制。

《專題快訊》亦指出香港在發展國際教育樞紐上仍面對不少挑戰，包括非本地學生來源地不夠多元化等。議員認為特區政府應有系統地制訂針對性宣傳策略，鎖定目標推廣國家（包括東盟及「一帶一路」國家），由特區政府牽頭聯同駐外經貿辦推廣「留學香港」品牌，並持續檢視政策定位和發展策略。

"LegCo Secretariat releases Policy Pulse on ""Building an international education hub""",2025-06-27 14:50,2025-06-27 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700419.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

The Legislative Council (LegCo) Secretariat today (June 27) released a Policy Pulse on ""Building an international education hub"". This issue provides a brief overview of the competitiveness of Hong Kong's education system, the unique advantages in developing Hong Kong into an international education hub, the related support measures by the Government, as well as relevant discussions of LegCo along with suggestions by Members.

As a cosmopolitan city, Hong Kong's education system is highly internationalized and diversified with great potential to become an international education hub. The Policy Pulse highlighted various international rankings of Hong Kong's education system, including being the only city with five universities in the world's top 100, ranking second globally in education competitiveness, and having the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education recognised by over 600 overseas post-secondary institutions. The Policy Pulse also briefly outlined the future development of post-secondary education in Hong Kong; the advantages brought by ""one country, two systems"" and enjoying strong support from the Motherland and being closely connected to the world; and the benefits of establishing an international education hub.

In the 2023 Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced the establishment of an ""international hub for postâsecondary education and a cradle for future talents"". He further proposed building the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand in his 2024 Policy Address. To promote Hong Kong as an international hub for post-secondary education and attract more talents to the city, the Government has introduced a series of measures. These include doubling the non-local student quota for University Grants Committee-funded universities; increasing the number of scholarship and hostel places; implementing schemes for non-local graduates to stay and seek employment in Hong Kong; strengthening research funding for institutions; promoting collaboration between Hong Kong and Mainland higher education institutions; and launching the Alliance of Universities in Applied Sciences to enhance the status of vocational and professional education and training.

To support the long-term development of post-secondary education, the Government has kickstarted the construction of the University Town project in the Northern Metropolis, and plans to announce the University Town Development Conceptual Framework in the first half of 2026. Members suggest the Government communicate with post-secondary institutions on the planning of the University Town and consider providing tax and financial incentives to encourage institutions to build second campuses in the University Town, and cooperate with industry and scientific research institutions, to give play to the industry-university-research effect, so as to attract research talents.

LegCo has been closely attentive to the development of education system in Hong Kong and formed a subcommittee to provide recommendations to the Government and the post-secondary education sector to speed up the development of an international postâsecondary education hub. In addition, LegCo has scrutinized and passed the Post Secondary Colleges (Amendment) Bill 2025, which aims to improve the monitoring and quality assurance mechanism for self-financing post-secondary institutions.

The Policy Pulse also pointed out that Hong Kong faces challenges in becoming an international education hub, including a lack of diversity in the sources of non-local students. Members suggest that the Government should systematically formulate targeted promotion strategies, identifying target countries including ASEAN and ""Belt and Road"" countries, and taking the lead in promoting ""Study in Hong Kong"" to these countries with the Economic and Trade Offices overseas, and continuously reviewing the policy positioning and development strategies.

The detailed content of ""Building an international education hub"" is available on the LegCo Website. The Policy Pulse, published by the LegCo Secretariat, covers specific topics and offers a comprehensive overview of related policy developments and summarized discussions in LegCo."

Following are the remarks by Mr Sun:

Reporter: What are the Government's expectation regarding the usage rate of this round of the Caring Food Coupon Programme, which stood at around 70 to 80 per cent for the last round?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Based on the usage rate last time when we provided lunch coupons to the elderly, the actual usage rate is around 76 per cent, but it varies among different restaurant chains. We are going to observe this time as well. We are going to step up promotional efforts, and as elderly users are getting used to obtaining the coupons and using them, we will see how the usage rate will be this time around. For the next round, the coupons will be for afternoon tea. It will be an all-year-round activity.

When Brazil Meets Hong Kong today (June 27):

Deputy CG Mr de Mattos (Deputy Consul-General of the Consulate General of Brazil in Hong Kong, Mr Hervelter de Mattos), Stefan (Chief Executive Officer of the Extravaganza Festival, Dr Stefan Matzinger), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning.

  It is a great pleasure to join you today at this fascinating celebration: Extravaganza! When Brazil Meets Hong Kong. With the joyful rhythms of samba echoing along Victoria Harbour, this event brings a refreshing burst of Brazilian spirit to the heart of our city.

  I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Stefan for bringing this world-renowned carnival to Hong Kong for the first time. My thanks also go to the talented Brazilian performers who have travelled across the globe to be here, and to our colleagues in the Government, the Hong Kong Tourism Board, and all supporting partners for your good work in making this festival a reality.

  Hong Kong is a city of contrasts and connections - where East meets West, tradition meets innovation, and urban energy coexists with nature. Our cultural offerings continue to grow. Consider the Hong Kong Palace Museum, which showcases the richness of Chinese heritage, or M+, which has quickly become a landmark for contemporary visual art in Asia. Or the stunning hiking trails which are just minutes away from the city.

  We are also internationally renowned for our culinary scene, with Michelin-starred restaurants and beloved local eateries offering a world of flavours. Besides that, our spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation continues to thrive, making Hong Kong not only a global business hub but a dynamic cultural and creative centre.

  To those visiting us - a very warm welcome. Seeing Hong Kong firsthand is the best way to understand that our city is as open, diverse, vibrant and international as ever.

  I'm glad that this festival has brought energy and joy to communities across the city, from school visits to lively street performances at our most iconic attractions. You are helping to enrich our cultural landscape and deepen cross-cultural connections.

  Looking ahead, we are committed to strengthening Hong Kong's role as Asia's events capital. With the new Kai Tak Sports Park, a world-class infrastructure, we will be hosting a wide range of international events. More than concerts and rugby, we are welcoming a number of top-class football matches there. I certainly hope we can host the Brazilian national football team sometime soon.

  Of course, beyond that, it requires imagination, innovation and inspiration to make our city even more attractive to tourists and residents. We need more events like this one, and more joint efforts of the business community, including the tourism, catering and retail sectors to create new experiences for consumers and visitors.

  Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a joyful and memorable Extravaganza. May this celebration of culture and creativity continue to build lasting bonds between Hong Kong and Brazil, Brazil and Hong Kong.

  Thank you very much."

Food Adulteration (Metallic Contamination) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 gazetted,2025-06-27 11:00,2025-06-27 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062600796.htm,"The Government published in the Gazette today (June 27) the Food Adulteration (Metallic Contamination) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 (Amendment Regulation) to update the food safety standards for metal content in food.

A Government spokesman said, ""The amendments are to enhance consumer protection, facilitate the food trade and keep local food safety standards on par with the international standards. The standards set out in the Amendment Regulation have taken into account factors such as the standards on metallic contamination of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), relevant standards adopted by major sources of food import, local food consumption patterns and dietary practices, and the results of risk assessment.""

The Amendment Regulation will add 27 new maximum levels (MLs) for specified metals (including lead, cadmium and methylmercury) in specified foods (food pairs) and update nine MLs for lead in the existing relevant food pairs, bringing the total number of MLs from 144 to 171. The Amendment Regulation provides for a grace period of 18 months, during which it would be legal for any food item to comply with the requirements of the existing Food Adulteration (Metallic Contamination) Regulations (Cap. 132V) or as amended.

""The Amendment Regulation is unlikely to affect the supply of food in Hong Kong in general, given that our proposed MLs are generally in line with the Codex's standards and the Mainland's standards. Furthermore, results from the routine food surveillance programme and additional baseline studies conducted by the Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department indicate that the levels of metallic contamination in food available in the local market can generally comply with the proposed MLs,"" the spokesman said.

âThe Amendment Regulation will be tabled before the Legislative Council on July 2 for negative vetting."

Local Cantonese opera elites to present two classic Three Kingdoms operas in July (with photos),2025-06-27 11:00,2025-06-27 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062600675.htm,"  The Chinese Culture Festival (CCF) 2025, organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD),will present two classic Three Kingdoms Cantonese operas ""Zhou Yu Thrice Humiliated"" and ""The Battle of Changbanpo"" in July. Under the artistic direction of veteran Cantonese opera artist Yuen Siu-fai, the productions will feature his long-time stage partner Wan Fai-yin, and Lee Lung, acclaimed as ""the living Zhao Yun (Zhao Zilong)"", alongside a dedicated cast of local Cantonese opera elites. The performances will take audiences back to the Three Kingdoms era of fierce rivalries and showcase the classic singing style and enduring legacy of Cantonese opera artistry. This programme is also one of the programmes of the 13th Chinese Opera Festival (COF).

  Details of the performances are as follows:

""Zhou Yu Thrice Humiliated""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date and time: July 26 (Saturday), 7.30pm

  The ""Zhou Yu Thrice Humiliated"" depicts the battle of wits and strategy between Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang. Zhou's repeated attempts were all thwarted by Zhuge's brilliance and to no avail in the end. Feeling infuriated, Zhou passes away, lamenting on the co-existence of Zhuge and Zhou in this world. Some of the arias in the play are performed in classic singing style (using Zhongzhou dialect), while the three climactic battle scenes employ long-unseen classic performance practices. Yuen Siu-fai, Lee Lung and Wan Fai-yin will portray Zhou Yu, Zhao Zilong and Lady Sun Shangxiang respectively, while young actors Alan Tam and Wan Yiu-sing will take on the roles of Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. Gathering some of the three generations' local elites to perform on the same stage, thereby passing down the invaluable traditions of Cantonese opera.

""The Battle at Changbanpo""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date and time: July 27 (Sunday), 7.30pm

  ""The Battle at Changbanpo"" was originally devised by Yuen Siu-fai for the reopening of Ko Shan Theatre in 1996. The story recounts Cao Cao's pursuit of Liu Bei at Changbanpo after defeating Lu Bu, focusing on Zhao Yun's heroic fest of charging seven times through Cao's army alone to rescue his master's infant heir. This time, the production again stars Lee Lung, who originally played Zhao Zilong, alongside Yuen Siu-fai as Liu Bei. A new generation of actors has also been cast, including Alan Tam as Lu Bu and Ng Kwok-wa as Zhang Fei. The play has a cast that covers the full range of role types, with some arias preserved in classic singing style. The performers will showcase the Xiqu art skills of the Southern School and the Northern School, enhanced by live music and powerful rhythms of gongs and drums to deliver the dramatic moments of the play.

ããThe two performances will be held at the Auditorium of Sha Tin Town Hall. Lyrics and part of the dialogue are with Chinese and English surtitles. Tickets priced at $180, $280, $380 and $480 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk).For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288.

政府發言人表示：「修訂旨在加強保障消費者、促進食品貿易，以及讓香港標準與國際標準接軌。《修訂規例》內的標準參考了食品法典委員會的標準、主要食物入口地的標準、本港的食物食用模式、飲食習慣和風險評估結果等。」

《修訂規例》會新增27個指明食物中的指明金屬（包括鉛、鎘和甲基汞）（食物組合）的含量上限，以及就現有相關食物組合更新九個涉及鉛的含量上限。《修訂規例》含量上限的總數由144個增加至171個。《修訂規例》設18個月的寬限期。其間，任何一項食品只須符合現行或經修訂的《食物攙雜（金屬雜質含量）規例》（第132V章）的規定，均屬合法。

發言人指：「由於建議的上限基本上與食品法典委員會的標準和內地標準一致，有關建議應不會影響香港的整體食物供應。再者，食物環境衞生署食物安全中心的恆常食物監測計劃和額外進行的基線研究結果顯示，本地市場所出售的食物中的金屬污染物含量大致符合建議的上限。」

《修訂規例》將於七月二日提交立法會，進行先訂立後審議程序。"
