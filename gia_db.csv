Welcome remarks by SDEV at Project Cost Management Forum 2025 (English only),2025-11-07 13:06,2025-11-07 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700383.htm,"âFollowing are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, at the Project Cost Management Forum 2025 today (November 7):

Deputy Financial Secretary (Mr Michael Wong), our esteemed speakers from Qatar, Singapore, the United Kingdom and our close neighbour, the Guangdong Province and to all the practitioners from the sector, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning! First of all, welcome to you all for joining this Project Cost Management Forum 2025 organised by the Centre of Excellence for Major Project Leaders spearheaded by the Development Bureau. We are privileged today to have renowned experts and practitioners from different parts of the world to share with us their advice on project cost governance and cost management, with their insights on project financing and delivery as well as adoption of innovative technology.

Hong Kong has made remarkable achievements as an international metropolis: we are well-known for our free economy, we are among the most desirable places to do business across the globe, and we ranked at the top among cities for our air cargo throughput etc, the list goes on. World-class infrastructure has been fundamental to this success, driving economic growth and sustaining our long-term competitiveness.

As you may have already known and as highlighted by the Deputy Financial Secretary just now, the 15th National Games will start this Sunday. We are hosting events like fencing, rugby sevens and handball. When it comes to sports, for sure, as the Deputy Financial Secretary has mentioned, the Kai Tak Sports Park would come to mind. Since its opening in March this year, numerous international events, games and concerts have been held, attracting not only locals but tourists around the world. The facility has lifted Hong Kong to greater heights. So it is a great example to testify how world-class facilities and infrastructure could drive our economy.

With a view to providing further impetus to drive Hong Kong's economy, as highlighted in the latest Policy Address and Budget, the Government is committed to accelerating the development of what we called the Northern Metropolis in the northern part of Hong Kong, a new engine for Hong Kong's future growth. This would entail involvement of significant amount of resources by both the public and private sectors to implement an array of infrastructure and development projects, delivering quality premises, as well as facilities for businesses and households.

Notwithstanding the benefits brought about by the investment, we are mindful of the need to use public money prudently. Since the inaugural Project Cost Management Forum held in 2021, we have been actively fostering a culture of cost-consciousness within the construction industry. Over the years, we have implemented holistic project cost management at various stages of public works projects to ensure the careful use of public funds. With the rollout of major development like the Northern Metropolis and an annual capital works expenditure exceeding HK$120 billion in the short to medium term, this cost-consciousness mindset is more critical than ever.

Given the current global financial situation, we must hold on to the principle of prudent use of public funds. Specifically, we are planning ahead with an ""ownership"" mindset - to comprehensively evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different implementation proposals and review site selection, usage mix, the scale of the project, design, implementation programme etc, in the very upfront stages, to formulate practical and cost-effective proposals.

We also fully embrace the full integration between technological and industrial innovation to enhance productivity, and we will adopt transformative solutions in our public works, echoing with our country's 15th Five-Year Plan. For example, the Development Bureau is actively formulating various measures to promote the use of Artificial Intelligence in the construction industry.

We are also keen to continuously uplift capabilities of our diverse construction talent pool, promote knowledge exchange with our Mainland and international partners, and strengthen collaborations with close working partners around the world, thereby reinforcing our role as international infrastructure centre.

As a concrete step to take forward the initiatives I mentioned just now, I am pleased to announce that we would shortly witness the exchange of a Memorandum of Understanding with Singapore. It demonstrates our shared commitment to fostering deeper collaboration in construction innovation and project management.

Lastly, just as robust infrastructure is fundamental to the progress of our society, so too is active civic participation. So you all know what I am going to say next. Please allow me to repeat an important message, an important appeal to you all, to actively participate in one such upcoming exercise to demonstrate civic mindedness, one that also bears significance to Hong Kong's development in the coming four years as we take forward major land development and infrastructure projects, and that is of course the Legislative Council election on December 7. I urge you to not just vote in your various capacities. I think all the practitioners here, you do have various capacities. So just vote in your various capacities and encourage your family, friends and colleagues to do the same. Just as our infrastructure helps shape a better city, your votes help build a better Hong Kong, the place we are proud to call home.

I am confident that today's Forum will be enlightening and inspiring. Let us make the most of this opportunity to collaborate, innovate, and drive progress together.

Thank you."

Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in GBA to be extended to Zhuhai and Nansha on Sunday,2025-11-07 12:38,2025-11-07 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700324.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government announced that the Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in the Greater Bay Area will be extended to designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha from November 9 (Sunday), marking a new phase of the Pilot Scheme.

  In his Policy Address in September this year, the Chief Executive has announced the extension of the cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements with the governments of Guangdong and Macao in an orderly manner, including expansion to cover designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha, as well as two-way transfers. To ensure the smooth implementation of relevant arrangements, the HKSAR Government, in collaboration with the People's Government of Zhuhai Municipality and the Nansha District People's Government of Guangzhou Municipality, conducted drills in September and October respectively to assess the simulated transfer of patients under the cross-boundary ambulance arrangements. The drills were conducted smoothly in general. The Pilot Scheme will be extended to Zhuhai People's Hospital and the Nansha Division of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, starting from November 9.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""With the high degree of integration among cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and frequent travelling of residents between different cities in the GBA for living and working, there is an increasing demand for the cross-boundary transfer of patients in a point-to-point mode. The extension of the Pilot Scheme will help enhance the medical collaboration in the GBA, offering patients a safer, more timely and convenient transfer arrangements.

  ""The arrangements for direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer in the GBA involve cross-boundary travelling of vehicles, healthcare personnel, drugs and medical devices, and more. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to various national ministries, including the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the National Health Commission and the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China, for their support and guidance which contributed to the smooth extension of the arrangements. I would also like to thank various authorities of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, the People's Government of Zhuhai Municipality, the Nansha District People's Government of Guangzhou Municipality and the People’s Government of Shenzhen Municipality for their concerted efforts in maintaining proactive communication and close collaboration on the arrangements for direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer. In addition, I would like to thank a number of HKSAR Government departments and organisations, including the Security Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, the Immigration Department, the Transport Department, the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority, for their full co-operation.""

  The Pilot Scheme was launched on November 30 last year, with the implementation of direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer of patients from designated sending hospitals in Shenzhen and Macao (i.e. the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital and the Conde S. Januario Hospital of Macao) to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong in its first phase. As at early November this year, a total of 17 patients (11 from Shenzhen and six from Macao) had been successfully transferred to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong for treatment. According to professional medical assessments, patients of the above cases have a need for continuous hospitalisation for treatment. Their conditions were relatively stable, but they were unable to cross the boundary on their own and were unsuitable for transfer to an ambulance via the existing boundary control points. The risk during transfers can be significantly reduced if patients are not required to be handed over between ambulances at boundary control points, and the arrangements fully demonstrated the continuous deepening of quality healthcare collaboration and development in the GBA. The overall operation of the Pilot Scheme has been smooth since its implementation, and it will be extended for one year until November 29 next year.

  The governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao will continue to review the effectiveness and operational experiences of the existing transfer arrangements, with the medical needs, safety and interests of patients as the prime concerns, as well as to press ahead with the objective of extending the cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements to two-way transfers as set out in the Policy Address, aiming for implementation early next year."

Police pay tribute to fallen police officers (with photos),2025-11-07 12:19,2025-11-07 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700311.htm,"The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) held the Force Remembrance Day ceremony at the Police Headquarters this morning (November 7). The Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, led police representatives to attend and pay solemn tribute to regular and auxiliary officers who made their ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.

Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Chow noted that retired and serving Force members were gathered in memory of the officers who sacrificed their lives in pursuit of the Force's mission. He said that the fallen officers' tenacity in preserving law and order, courage in times of danger and passion in serving the community were commemorated and honoured. Their legacy has been etched in history, underscoring that the job of police is a mission worthy of pride. Their dedication to safeguarding the society and people's lives and property has not only been exemplary for each and every one in the Force but has also left a lasting impression on the public, fortifying the long-established professional image of HKPF.

He mentioned that the spirit of the fallen comrades and all devoted Force members has led generations of colleagues to pass on professionalism and the finest traditions. This has enabled the entire Force to forge ahead and tide over obstacles despite challenges to law and order, major incidents, natural disasters and pandemics, allowing Hong Kong to be back on the right track and ensuring the stability of citizens' lives.

He continued, ""The global environment remains dynamic and complex. Safeguarding national security and maintaining law and order still require our all-out efforts. I am fully confident that every member of the Force, including regular, civilian and auxiliary, will continue to uphold the professional spirit of our predecessors."" He encouraged colleagues to face challenges head-on, strive for excellence and exemplify unity and strength as ""One Force"", ensuring the HKPF remains one of the finest law enforcement agencies in the world.

During the ceremony, the Police Band bugler sounded the ""Last Post"" to signal a two-minute silence. Wreaths were laid in front of the Force Memorial Wall respectively by Mr Chow; the Commandant of the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force, Mr Leung Sai-kwong; and representatives of various police formations and associations."
「大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃」周日擴展至珠海及南沙,2025-11-07 12:00,2025-11-07 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700251.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府公布「大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃」將由十一月九日（星期日）起擴展至珠海與南沙的指定醫院，標誌着試行計劃進入新階段。

行政長官在今年九月發表的《施政報告》中提出，聯同粵澳政府有序地擴展救護車跨境轉運病人安排，包括納入珠海和南沙兩地指定醫院並實施雙向轉運。為確保有關安排暢順，香港特區政府在九月及十月分別聯同珠海市及廣州市南沙區人民政府進行演練，測試在模擬載送病人的情況下的救護車跨境安排，過程大致順暢。試行計劃將由十一月九日起擴展至珠海市人民醫院和中山大學附屬第一醫院南沙院區。

醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授表示：「隨着粵港澳大灣區城市高度融合，區內居民因生活和工作穿梭不同灣區城市，以『點對點』方式跨境轉運病人的需求日益殷切。試行計劃的擴展將有助提升大灣區的醫療協作，為病人提供更安全、及時和便捷的轉運安排。」

「大灣區跨境直通救護車安排涉及車輛、醫護人員和藥物器材等跨境往來。安排得以順利擴展，我要衷心感謝國家多個部委，包括國務院港澳事務辦公室、國家衞生健康委員會和國家海關總署的支持及指導。我亦非常感謝廣東省、珠海市、廣州市南沙區和深圳市政府各部門共同努力，就救護車跨境直通轉運病人安排積極商討和緊密合作。另外，我要感謝特區政府多個部門及機構，包括保安局、運輸及物流局、香港警務處、香港海關、入境事務處、運輸署、衞生署和醫院管理局等通力合作。」

試行計劃於去年十一月三十日推出，首階段實行跨境直通救護車由深圳市和澳門特區的指定派送醫院（即香港大學深圳醫院和澳門仁伯爵綜合醫院）載送病人到香港的指定公立醫院。截至今年十一月初，粵港澳三地已成功轉運17名病人（深圳11名；澳門六名）到香港指定公立醫院接受治療。根據專業醫療評估，上述個案的病人有持續住院的治療需要，情況均相對穩定，但無法自行跨境，亦不適合經現有口岸轉乘救護車。病人過境時無需轉換救護車，大大減低運送期間的風險，充分體現粵港澳大灣區優質醫療衞生合作和發展持續深化。試行計劃啓動以來，整體運作良好，並會延續一年至明年十一月二十九日。

粵港澳三地政府部門會持續檢視現行轉運安排的成效及運作經驗，以病人的醫療需要、安全和利益作首要考慮，並繼續積極推進《施政報告》提出擴展救護車跨境轉運病人安排至雙向轉運的目標，期望可於明年年初實施。"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-06 20:09,2025-11-06 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600742.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 6), the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
-----------------------------

The case involves a 73-year-old male living alone in Tung Chung. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Foshan in Guangdong alone between October 20 and 30. He developed a fever and joint pain on November 4, and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of North Lantau Hospital yesterday (November 5). He was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

Since the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 59 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, three were local cases and the rest were imported cases. For the local case recently announced, the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch has completed genome analysis of the 45-year-old patient. The results indicated that the genetic sequence of his viral sample differed from those of other imported CF cases recorded in Hong Kong and the two local CF cases in Wong Tai Sin, suggesting separate sources of infection. The CHP cannot rule out the possibility that an earlier, undiagnosed patient in an area visited by the 45-year-old patient, transmitted the virus to mosquitoes, which then infected him.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
--------------------------------------------------------------

In light of a recent local case in Kwai Tsing District,the CHP, based on the risk assessment, urged the residents living near Mount Haven in Tsing Yi, Kwai Chung Plaza and Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they develop symptoms such as fever, rash or joint pain after October 1.The CHP officers and relevant District Services & Community Care Teams have distributed leaflets on CF prevention to over 10 000 households in Mount Haven and the surrounding areas , Kwai Chung Plaza, Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan and the vicinityto remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

The CHP has set up health consultation booths at Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi, Kwai Fong Estate (near Kwai Ming House) and the pedestrian bridge towards the east exit of Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan to provide assessments to members of the public with relevant symptoms. Please visit the CHP's webpage for the addresses and operating hours of the health consultation booths. The inquiry hotline (2125 2373), which was set up earlier, continues to operate daily from 9am to 8pm.

 From November 3 to 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for approximately 13 000 individuals residing or working in higher-risk districts through the health consultation booths at the abovementioned locations, its inquiry hotline, door-to-door visits and questionnaires conducted in the districts concerned. A total of 14 individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests. Details are as follows:





In the vicinity of Mount Haven in Tsing Yi

In the vicinity of Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan

TheFood and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
 The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Speech by FS at Hong Kong International Wine and Spirits Fair 2025 (English only) (with photos/video),2025-11-06 19:51,2025-11-06 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600730.htm," Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong International Wine and Spirits Fair 2025 today (November 6):

Jenny (Acting Executive Director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Ms Jenny Koo), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It's a pleasure to join you once again at the Hong Kong International Wine and Spirits Fair — a gathering where the world's finest wines and liquors come together in celebration and collaboration.

 A heartfelt thank you to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) for organising the 17th edition of this iconic event. This Fair continues to be a global stage for the best in the business.

  This annual flagship event has long been a highlight of the international wine and spirits calendar. And this year, it's made even more vibrant by the buzz surrounding our policy change last year: reduction in the duty on high-end liquor. Since this spirited shift, the industry has responded with enthusiasm and pleasing results. The volume of duty-paid liquor imports rose by about 5 per cent, and the value surged by nearly 45 per cent.

 I'm particularly excited about the debut of the new ""World of Spirits"" zone this year, as mentioned by Jenny just now. It brings together top-tier distillers from across the globe, including the renowned baijiu of the Mainland and our very own homegrown craft spirits. Hong Kong has always been an international showcase, and I truly believe local and Chinese products have great potential in the global market.

 For the wine lovers among us – and I suspect there are quite many – this year's Fair offers a world of discovery. You'll find the rising stars from high-altitude vineyards in Ningxia, sun-soaked terroirs in Xinjiang, bold reds from Spain, and coastal treasures from Portugal. It's a passport-free trip through some of the world's best wine regions.

 But don't stop here. Take your taste buds into the city. Hong Kong is home to Bar Leone, which has recently been crowned the best bar in the world, right in the heart of Central. And what's a good drink without great food? With over 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants across the city, you're never far from a perfect pairing.

 With this rich blend of global flavours, satisfying experiences, Hong Kong is not just a place to do business – it's the place to be. We are proud to support the global wine and spirits community as you open up new markets, forge new partnerships, and raise the bar.

 The Hong Kong Wine and Spirits Fair is more than a showcase. It's a launchpad. Whether you're here to source the next big label, seal a new deal, or simply enjoy a glass or two of something exceptional — you are most welcome, with open arms and full glasses.

 Once again, my sincere thanks to the HKTDC for making this Fair a living, breathing brand of Hong Kong's international spirit.

  And before I let you go, a gentle reminder for our local friends: mark your calendars for December 7 — the Legislative Council Elections. Your vote matters. Let's raise our voices, and our glasses, for Hong Kong's future.

 Thank you, and enjoy the Fair!"

Home and Youth Affairs Bureau appeals to property management sector for full support for 2025 Legislative Council General Election (with photos),2025-11-06 19:42,2025-11-06 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600726.htm,"âThe Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) held a seminar for the property management (PM) sector at the Central Government Offices today (November 6) on the 2025 Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election, appealing for the active participation and full support of the PM sector for the LegCo General Election to be held on December 7.

The seminar was attended by about 70 representatives from PM sector, including the Chairman, Dr Wong Kong-tin and members engaged in PM services of the Property Management Services Authority, as well as representatives of six PM professional bodies and over 20 major PM companies.

The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, said that the seventh-term LegCo formed after the improvement of the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has fully demonstrated the advantages of the executive-led system under the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"". A highly efficient interaction has been formed between the executive and legislative authorities which has achieved remarkable results. The upcoming LegCo General Election is of great significance to the future development of Hong Kong.

Miss Mak said at the seminar, ""The work of LegCo has direct impact on the operation and development of the PM sector in areas such as building management, community building and environmental enhancement. As an important force in social services, the PM sector shoulders the important mission of improving district governance and is closely connected with the work of LegCo."" She appealed to the PM sector to make use of its extensive network built within the community to encourage staff and property owners to exercise their civic rights and fulfil their civic responsibility by casting their votes on the polling day.

  ""The PM sector should encourage staff and property owners to cast their votes through various means, including stepping up internal publicity and enhancing awareness of voting, making flexible work arrangements to facilitate staff to vote, as well as assisting in the promotion of election messages in the housing estates and buildings they serve to create a strong election atmosphere.""

PM sector representatives attending the seminar said that they had gained a deeper understanding of the importance of the LegCo General Election to social development through the seminar, and they would respond to the appeal by giving their full support to the LegCo General Election. A representative attending the seminar said that the PM sector attaches great importance to the LegCo General Election and will deploy resources and adopt diverse and creative approaches to encourage property owners to vote, as well as introduce measures to encourage and facilitate PM practitioners to cast their votes by, for example, providing transportation assistance and flexible work arrangements for staff who need to be on duty.

The HKSAR Government will continue to work closely with the PM sector to encourage electors to exercise their civic rights and fulfil their civic responsibility on the polling day, and to elect capable candidates to form the new term of the LegCo, thereby injecting new impetus into the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and building a better future together."

Dr Lam briefed her on Hong Kong's efforts and achievements in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the promotion of mental health.

During the meeting, the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), Dr Edwin Tsui, briefed Dr Huong Tran on the overall strategies and directions of the DH and the CHP in disease surveillance and prevention, and in promoting the public's physical and mental health. The DH officers later gave Dr Huong Tran an in-depth presentation on Hong Kong's work in promoting mental health, the Whole School Health Programme, prevention and control of NCDs and cancer screening programmes.

""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (the Government) attaches great importance on preventing and controlling NCDs and promoting mental health. These areas are our key public health priorities. 'The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address' has outlined relevant initiatives, including the enhancement of cancer prevention and screening as well as weight management. Hong Kong's work on prevention and control of NCDs align with the WHO's Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs, the Regional Action Framework for NCDs Prevention and Control and the Regional Framework for the Future of Mental Health in the Western Pacific. Last week, the 16th meeting of the Steering Committee on Prevention and Control of NCDs reviewed the progress of the local targets in the prevention and control of NCDs and actions taken by various government departments. The DH will continue to enhance our resilience and capacity in addressing NCDs, including mental health, by aligning with relevant policy frameworks from the Chinese Mainland and the WHO,"" said Dr Lam.

Dr Huong Tran commended Hong Kong's achievements in the prevention and control of NCDs. The risk of premature mortality from four major NCDs in Hong Kong has declined continuously, with a reduction of over 25 per cent when compared to 15 years ago, demonstrating significant progress. She was impressed by Hong Kong's mental health promotion with its clear strategy and strong approach. She also affirmed the determination and commitment of the Government in promoting healthcare reform, which will help strengthen public health measures and further promote public health. Dr Huong Tran emphasised the role of the WHO in facilitating collaboration and sharing good experiences of Hong Kong to other countries/areas in the region in the areas of NCDs and mental health.

Dr Lam concluded the meeting by saying that the DH looked forward to maintaining close communication and collaboration with the WHO to jointly explore more effective public health measures. This will provide more comprehensive protection for the mental and physical health of the public and contribute to building a healthy regional community.

Dr Huong Tran's visit to Hong Kong is to attend an international mental health conference."
立法會主席就立法會換屆選舉提名期結束會見傳媒的發言,2025-11-06 19:28,2025-11-06 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600676.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是立法會主席梁君彥今日（十一月六日）於立法會綜合大樓會見傳媒的發言：

第八屆立法會選舉的提名期，在今日下午五時剛剛結束，有超過160位有志之士報名參選。我們見到全部參選人都是有擔當、有才幹、有抱負，年青有為的愛國愛港人士；大家都懷着一顆致力為香港謀發展，為市民謀幸福的心。我留意到參選人來自不同界別，背景多元，其中今次女性參選人的比例突破兩成二，較上屆百分之十八更高。參選人各有優勢，我相信他們會將各方各面的專業經驗、新意念、新的政策倡議，帶入新一屆立法會，為議會注入新力量，帶來新氣象。

我感到欣喜的是，今次選舉延續了第七屆立法會的健康現象，就是再次出現90個議席全部都會在有競爭的環境下產生，「每個選區都有競爭、每個界別都有得揀」，部分選區的競爭比上屆更激烈。所有參選人都站在同一起跑線上，無任何人得到所謂「特別的祝福」，沒有「穩勝的名單」，他們都必須以實力、以政‍綱理念、以服務社會的熱誠去決勝負。我期待參選人展開一場高水平的君子之爭。

我深信每位參選人經過選舉的洗禮，都會更了解選民對立法會的期望、對社會的關注。將他們的聲音帶入議會，令到無論是議會，還是政府的施政更「貼地」，切合國家及香港的整體利益。

香港正處於機遇與挑戰並存的關鍵時刻。第七屆立法會在推動香港經濟和民生發展方面，交出了亮麗成績。在本屆立法會的成功實踐上，在這個高標準之下，第八屆立法會必須繼往開來，將務實惠民的議‍會工作做得更好！

立法會議員是特區管治團隊的重要組成部分，對提升特區治理能力和效能，肩負重要責任。新一屆立法會議員任重道遠，除了深化行政立法良性互動，繼續為民發聲，推進良政善治之外，亦要幫助香港各界把握機遇，進一步主動深入對接國‍家「十五五」規劃，同時發揮 「一國兩制」下香港的獨特優勢。

今次選舉不僅是推動高質量民主發展的重要里程碑，亦是全港市民選擇更好未來、共創更好未來的關鍵時刻。我雖然不再競逐連任，但我會身體力行，全力支持今次立法會換屆選舉，最重要是支持這次選舉能夠公開、公平、公正及安全有序地順利舉行。

我亦要趁此機會多謝其他不再參選的議員。他們對立法會工作的投入和付出都值得大家欣賞。我知道他們同我一樣，會積極鼓勵更多選民投票。

立法會是香港最重要的民意代表機關，立法會選舉從來都是香港特‍區憲制發展的大事。大家不要因為立法會已經回復理性，不再有內耗和激烈場面，而不重視立法會選舉和立法會的職能。我呼籲選‍民於十二月七日踴躍投票，履行公民責任，選出代表你的代議士進入議會。我相信，越多愛國愛港、德才兼備的有志之士參選和加入立法會、越多選民在立法會選舉中投票，立法會亦會更有底氣和力量，說好立法會故事、說好香港故事、說好中國故事！

我今日已聯同立法會秘書處秘書長衛碧瑤Dora發信給全體議員、議員職員，以及秘書處所有同事，呼籲大家十二月七日踴躍投票，因為作為立法會一份子，是責無旁貸，應以身作則，以實際行動展現對立法會選舉的支持、對香‍港未來的承擔！

Remarks by LegCo President on conclusion of nomination period for LegCo General Election at media session,2025-11-06 19:28,2025-11-06 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600670.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

  Following is the remarks by the President of the Legislative Council (LegCo), Mr Andrew Leung, at a media briefing at the LegCo Complex today (November 6):

  The nomination period for the General Election of the Eighth Legislative Council ends today (November 6), (with) over 160 young and promising contestants. All the contestants are patriots who love Hong Kong and have shown their commitments, capabilities and aspirations. They come from all walks of life, with diverse backgrounds and distinct strengths, but share the same devotion to Hong Kong's development and to the best interests of the people. With their professional experiences in different sectors, I believe they will bring a new paradigm for the Eighth LegCo.

  We are delighted to see that the upcoming election remains highly competitive. Same as the previous LegCo election, all 90 seats in each constituency are contested. The competitions in some constituencies are fiercer than in the last election. No one would receive the so-called ""special blessing"" as all contestants start on the same starting line and compete on the basis of their abilities, policy platforms and their dedication to serving the society, delivering a high-quality and civil election.

  The election will enable every contestant to know better the public expectation on LegCo and the concerns of the citizens of Hong Kong. By bringing their voices into the Legislature, it will make both the LegCo and Government's governance more down-to-earth and aligned with the overall interests of the country and Hong Kong.

  Hong Kong is now at a critical juncture filled with opportunities and challenges. The Seventh LegCo has delivered an impressive result in promoting Hong Kong's economic development and people's livelihood. Built on this high standard, I firmly believe the Eighth LegCo will do a better job and yield more fruitful results!

  LegCo is an important part of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region)'s governing team, bearing important responsibilities for enhancing the capability and effectiveness of the governance. Members of the Eighth LegCo are charged with heavy responsibilities for speaking on behalf of the people and promoting good governance. They also need to help all sectors of Hong Kong to seize opportunities and further integrate into the national development under the 15th Five-Year Plan.

  The upcoming election is not only an important milestone for advancing high-quality democratic development but also a key moment for all Hong Kong people to choose and create a better future. Although I am not running for re-election, I will fully support the upcoming General Election. A smooth conduct of the election in an open, fair, just, safe and orderly manner is of paramount importance.

  LegCo election has always been a major event in the constitutional development of the Hong Kong SAR. The Legislature has returned to rationality and there is no longer internal strife. Our work seems to be easier, but every vote counts in the election. I urge all voters to fulfill their civic responsibility and cast their ballots on December 7 to elect your representatives in LegCo.

  Today, Dora, the Secretary General of the LegCo Secretariat, and I have issued a letter to all Members and their staff, as well as all staff of the Secretariat, urging them to vote. It is our duty to lead by example, taking concrete actions to show support for the LegCo election and demonstrating our commitment to Hong Kong SAR's future!

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-06 19:15,2025-11-06 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600696.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月六日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名73歲男子，獨居於東涌。初步調查顯示，他於十月二十日至三十日獨自到訪廣東省佛山市，十一月四日出現發燒及關節痛，昨日（十一月五日）到北大嶼山醫院急症室求醫，獲安排留院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得59宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，三宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。就日前公布的一宗本地個案，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處已完成對該名45歲男子的病毒基因分析工作。結果顯示，他的病毒樣本基因序列，與其他本港錄得的基孔肯雅熱輸入個案及首兩宗在黃大仙的本地感染個案不一樣，顯示他們的感染源頭不同。中心不排除在該名病人活動的地區內，早前有未確診的患者將病毒傳播給蚊子，導致他受感染。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應葵青區日前錄得一宗本地個案，中心按風險評估呼籲青衣曉峰園、葵涌廣場及上環信德中心一帶居民，若於十月一日後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛症狀的人士，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和有關地區的關愛隊已向曉峰園和附近的居民、葵涌廣場及上環信德中心一帶超過10 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的單張，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

中心現時在青衣長亨社區會堂、葵芳邨近葵明樓和上環信德中心東出口方向行人天橋設立醫護站，為出現相關症狀的市民作評估。三個醫護站的地址和運作時間請參閱中心網站。而早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）繼續每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。

由十一月三日至今日下午五時，中心透過設於上述三個地點的醫護站、熱線電話及於區內進行上門探訪和問卷調查，已為約13 000名在較高風險地區居住或工作的市民進行評估，並為14名的出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，詳情如下：

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

會上，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）總監徐樂堅醫生向Huong Tran博士簡介衞生署及中心在監控和預防疾病，以及促進市民身心健康的整體策略和方向。其後，署方人員亦向Huong Tran博士深入介紹了本港在推廣精神健康的工作、「全校園健康計劃」、防控非傳染病及癌症篩查計劃等不同方面的工作。

林文健醫生說：「香港特區政府高度重視防治非傳染病及推廣精神健康，將有關工作列為公共衞生重點領域。《行政長官2025年施政報告》亦已羅列相關措施，包括加強癌症預防和篩查，以及體重管理。本港的防控非傳染病工作參照世衞《預防和控制非傳染性疾病全球行動計劃》、西太平洋區域非傳染病防控行動框架和精神衞生未來框架，上周舉行的防控非傳染病督導委員會第十六次會議，檢視了本地防控非傳染病目標的進展及不同部門的行動。衞生署會繼續參照國家及世衞的相關政策框架，持續提升本港應對非傳染病（包括精神健康）的韌性和能力。」

Huong Tran博士讚揚香港在防控非傳染病的成效。本港因四大非傳染病而導致的早逝風險持續下降，與十五年前相比減少了超過25%，成效顯著。她對香港推廣精神健康所採取的明確策略及有力措施深表肯定。她亦肯定特區政府推動醫療改革的決心和工作，將有助強化公共衞生措施，進一步促進市民的健康。Huong Tran博士強調世衞在促進合作所發揮的作用以及與區域內其他國家／地區分享香港在防控非傳染病和精神健康方面的良好經驗。

林文健醫生總結會議時表示，衞生署期待繼續與世衞保持緊密溝通和協作，共同探索更高效的公共衞生措施，更全面保障市民的精神和身體健康，亦為構建區域建康共同體貢獻力量。

​Huong Tran博士是次訪港是出席一個有關精神健康的國際會議。"

  Addressing the opening ceremony today (November 6), the Assistant Director (Heritage and Museums) of the LCSD, Mr Ng Chi-wo, said that the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao region is Dr Sun's home and the place where he was raised, as well as the cradle of his revolutionary ideas. Dr Sun has mentioned that Hong Kong was the origin of his revolutionary ideology. He met like-minded mentors and friends during his studies in Hong Kong as a youth, laying the groundwork for his revolutionary endeavors. This exhibition, which started at The Museum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Dr Sun's hometown Zhongshan, travelled to the Macao Museum and finally arrived at the last stop in Hong Kong, connecting relics from the three regions, illustrating Dr Sun's evolution from ""healing patients to saving a nation"". This exhibition not only portrays Dr Sun's expansive revolutionary journey but also highlights his profound and enduring connections with the Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao region.

  âOther officiating guests included the Deputy Director of Zhongshan Culture, Radio, Television and Tourism Bureau, Mr Gong Wei; the Director of Macao Museum, Ms Lou Ho-ian; the great grandnephew of Dr Sun Yat-sen and Museum Expert Adviser, Mr Peter B Sun; the Director of The Museum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Mr Wu Chunning; and the Museum Director of the Hong Kong Museum of History, Ms Joyce Ho.

  Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao, where Dr Sun's life course developed from healing patients to saving a nation, share common roots and culture. This roving special exhibition showcases over 60 precious artefacts, documents and historic photographs related to Dr Sun from the three places. Highlight exhibits include the glass negative of the photograph of ""Four Great Desperados"" taken in Hong Kong, a historic photograph of the Hou Keng Reading Society (the club of Tong Meng Hui in Macao), the University of Hong Kong's letter to Dr Sun inviting him to an inauguration ceremony, the inscription of ""Bo Ai"" (fraternity) written by Dr Sun dedicated to Hong Kong seamen, the Order of Generalissimo written by Dr Sun during his tenure as the Army and Navy Grand Marshal in Guangzhou, and the navigation clock of the ""Zhongshan"" warship in memory of Dr Sun, among others.

  To tie in with the exhibition, the SYSM will organise ""Kom Tong Hall under the Moonlight"" lunar lamp-making workshops on November 8 and November 16 with free admission. The SYSM also invited scholars from Hong Kong and Macao to hold two lectures on November 29 and December 13 respectively, to reflect on Dr Sun's thoughts on China's path in his later years and Dr Sun's family in Macao. The public is welcome to join. For details of the exhibition and activities, please visit the website at hk.drsunyatsen.museum/en/web/sysm/exhibitions.html#special-exhibition.

  To support Muse Fest HK in November, the SYSM will organise a Fun Day on November 9. Programmes include the ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" film show, a storytelling workshop of Kom Tong Hall, a family music theatre, handicraft workshops, footprints of a Dr Sun exploration game, and more. The SYSM will also set up a copper plate-pressing machine and a replica of Dr Sun's photo studio, allowing participants to have a deeper understanding of the SYSM, and look back at the life and career of Dr Sun. The public can join all programmes on-site for free, while prior registration is available for some programmes.

海關人員昨日在荃灣進行反私煙行動，於一個私人屋苑內截查一名三十歲的可疑男子，其後押解該名男子到屋苑內的住所調查，並在單位內檢獲該批懷疑私煙，人員隨即將他拘捕。經初步調查，海關相信該懷疑私煙貯存倉庫主要供應私煙予荃灣一帶。

被捕人士已被落案控以「處理應課稅品條例適用的貨品」罪，並將於明日（十一月七日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

One person was arrested.

  Customs officers conducted an anti-illicit cigarette operation in Tsuen Wan yesterday and intercepted a suspicious 30-year-old man in a private residential estate. The man was then escorted to his residence there for a search, where the batch of suspected illicit cigarettes was seized. The man was subsequently arrested. After preliminary investigations, Customs believes that the suspected illicit cigarette storage centre was primarily used to supply illicit cigarettes to areas in Tsuen Wan.

  The arrested person was charged with ""dealing with goods to which the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance applies"" and will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (November 7).

  Customs reminds members of the public that under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

  A spokesman for the CFS said, ""During an inspection of the concerned consignment of food imported from Japan, the CFS found six cartons of frozen dried fish manufactured in Chiba Prefecture after the Order was issued. The importer concerned is thus suspected of breaching the relevant Order.""

  According to the Order, all aquatic products originating from 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, are prohibited from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong if they are harvested, manufactured, processed or packed on or after August 24, 2023, including all live, chilled, frozen, dried or otherwise preserved aquatic products, sea salt, and unprocessed or processed seaweed.

At the meeting, members were briefed by government officials on the latest progress of the third cohort of the Programme and exchanged views on the implementation of the fourth cohort, which will be launched in 2026.

  Mr Chan expressed his gratitude to the enterprises and organisations serving as strategic partners of the Partners' Board. He pointed out that they have given full play to the synergies of the Government, the business sector and the community, offering staunch support to the current term Government's targeted poverty alleviation strategy to help young people from underprivileged families achieve personal growth and development. Since its launch, the Programme has benefited over 10 000 students in total across three cohorts, demonstrating remarkable results.

  Members were pleased to learn that the third cohort of the Programme has received multifaceted support from over 400 enterprises and organisations, including donations, nominations of mentors and arrangements of group activities. In addition, 50 Star Mentors of various professions shared their personal experiences and insights, inspiring mentees to establish their own personal development goals. The Programme continued to provide mentees with diversified learning opportunities, including enterprise visits and special experience activities. Through participating in Mainland study tours, mentees were also given the opportunity to interact with local youths, experience different cultures, as well as deepen their understanding of the country's history and recent developments. Moreover, graduates of the Programme have been actively engaging in activities of the Strive and Rise Alumni Club, such as participating in Youth Committees and various representative teams, to further develop their strengths for self-enhancement and thus sustaining the Programme's impact.

  Mr Chan added that mentee enrolment for the Programme's fourth cohort commenced on October 27, with a recruitment target of 4 000. In the coming year, Strive and Rise Alumni Club activities will be enriched to include training and experience integrating elements of Hong Kong pop culture and traditional Chinese arts. Mr Chan called on various sectors of society to continue supporting the Programme through sponsorship and donations, nomination of mentors, organisation of group activities and Mainland study tours, as well as provision of job-sampling opportunities for mentees. He expressed the hope that the concerted efforts of all parties will help uplift more underprivileged youths, supporting them in broadening their horizons and reinforcing self-confidence, thereby collectively witnessing their growth and development.

  At the meeting, Mr Chan also encouraged all Partners' Board members to encourage their staff and associated personnel to cast their votes on the polling day of the Legislative Council General Election on December 7. He further called upon employers to offer various convenient arrangements on polling day to enable staff to fulfil their civic duty by electing aspiring and capable Legislative Council Members, thereby working together to build a better community.

  The membership of the Board comprises the Chief Secretary for Administration, representatives of relevant government departments, and strategic partners providing the Programme with key support. Regular meetings will be held for the Government to report on the Programme's progress and to tap into the collective wisdom of the members to enhance the Programme."

房委會通過鼓勵市民循房屋階梯上進上流的措施,2025-11-06 17:00,2025-11-06 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600246.htm,"下稿代香港房屋委員會發出：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）資助房屋小組委員會 （小組委員會）今日（十一月六日）通過一系列措施，鼓勵市民循房屋階梯上進上流。該些措施包括為白表居屋第二市場計劃（「白居二」）增加配額及優化安排，以及放寬新推售資助出售單位於公開市場轉讓的限制年期。

房委會將從下一期「白居二」開始，進一步增加1 000個配額至7 000個。新增配額的其中一半會撥予40歲以下選擇參加「青年計劃（白居二）」的家庭及一人申請者，餘下五百個則屬一般配額。

房委會發言人表示：「房委會因應市場對於『白居二』配額的熱切需求，已在『白居二2024』大幅增加1 500個配額並將新增配額全數撥予40歲以下的青年家庭及一人申請者。該期超額申請約五倍，而在所有申請中，超過八成為選擇參加『青年計劃（白居二）』的青年申請者，反映有關計劃深受青年人歡迎。」

就「白居二」的運作安排，小組委員會注意到，近期的計劃中，平均約有15%至20%獲配額的申請者沒有在指定日期內申請購買資格證明書，以便在第二市場購買尚未補價的單位。

為避免「白居二」配額因個人意願轉變而被浪費，小組委員會通過由下一期「白居二」開始，房委會發出的批准信數目將會適量大於「白居二」配額，讓購買單位的配額得以盡用。房委會會因應相關因素敲定超過配額的比率，並於每期接受申請前公布詳情。

小組委員會亦通過，由「白居二2024」起，任何未能用盡的家庭配額將撥予一人申請者，此安排與一手資助出售單位銷售計劃的做法一致。此外，為讓「白居二2024」的配額得以盡用，房委會會視乎獲批配額的申請者申領購買資格證明書的情況，就未使用的配額按申請者的抽籤先後次序多發出一批批准信。

房委會亦會由下一期居者有其屋計劃（居屋）開始，將綠、白表的配額比例由40：60調升至50：50，同時增加居屋及綠表置居計劃（綠置居）面積較大單位的比例，以鼓勵公共租住房屋租戶購買資助出售單位。

為防止短期投機活動，房委會於二○二二年通過收緊居屋和綠置居單位的轉讓限制，把於公開市場在繳付補價後出售單位的限制期限，由首次轉讓日期起計首十年延長至首十五年。因應目前最新市場情況，居屋及綠置居單位在公開市場的成交量持續下降。有見及此，並為鼓勵業主循置業階梯向上流動，小組委員會今日通過，由下一期新推售的居屋及綠置居單位開始，新推售的資助出售單位於公開市場出售限制的年期，將由現時首次轉讓日期起計十五年，縮短至十年。

保障市民基本的住屋需求是政府施政的首要任務。在公營房屋供應持續增加的基礎上，政府同時致力豐富房屋階梯，協助市民向上流動。去年的《施政報告》提出了不同措施協助市民，尤其是青年人置業，為他們燃點希望。行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》進一步公布了一系列措施，協助不同階層市民安居樂業。"
HA approves measures to encourage upward mobility through housing ladder,2025-11-06 17:00,2025-11-06 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600243.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Housing Authority:

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA)'s Subsidised Housing Committee (SHC) today (November 6) approved a series of measures that encourage upward mobility through the housing ladder, including increasing the quota and enhancing the arrangements of the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM), and relaxing the alienation restriction period of new subsidised sale flats (SSF) that will be put up for sale in the open market.

  Starting from the next WSM exercise, the HA will further increase the quota by 1 000 to 7 000. Half of the additional quotas will be allocated to young families and one-person applicants aged below 40 opting to join the Youth Scheme (WSM), while the remaining 500 are ordinary quotas.

  ""In response to keen market demand for the WSM quota, the HA substantially increased the quota by 1 500 and all of them were allocated to young families and one-person applicants aged below 40 under WSM 2024, which eventually was over-subscribed by about five times. More than 80 per cent of the applications received came from young applicants opting to join the Youth Scheme (WSM). This reflected that the scheme was well received by young people,"" a spokesman for HA said.

  Regarding the operational arrangements of the WSM, the SHC noted that, in recent WSM exercises, an average of about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the applicants awarded with a quota did not apply for the Certificate of Eligibility to Purchase (CEP) within a specified period for purchasing SSF with premium unpaid in the secondary market.

  To avoid wastage of quotas due to personal preferences, the SHC endorsed that starting from the next WSM exercise, the number of Approval Letters to be issued by the HA will be suitably higher than the quota set under the WSM exercise, ensuring that the quota for flat purchases can be fully utilised. The HA will determine the exact percentage of the over-issuance having regard to relevant factors, and details will be announced prior to each application period.

  The SHC also approved, starting from the WSM 2024, any unused family quotas will be allocated to one-person applicants, which is consistent with the practice adopted for the primary SSF sale exercise. Moreover, to ensure full utilisation of WSM 2024 quotas, depending on the situation of approved applicants applying for the CEPs, the HA will issue an additional batch of Approval Letters according to the ballot order to cover unused quotas.

  The HA will also increase the ratio of the quota allocation between Green Form and White Form from 40:60 to 50:50 starting from the next Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) sale exercise, and at the same time increase the ratio of larger units in HOS and Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH) projects to encourage more Public Rental Housing tenants to purchase SSF.

  The HA tightened the alienation restrictions of HOS and GSH flats in 2022 to prevent short-term speculative activities. The restriction period for sale in the open market upon payment of premiums was lengthened from the first 10 years to the first 15 years since the date of first assignment. Taking into account the latest market development that the transactions of HOS and GSH flats in the open market have been declining, and to encourage upward mobility through the housing ladder, the SHC endorsed today to shorten the alienation restriction period of new SSF that will be put up for sale in the open market from 15 years to 10 years from the date of the first assignment, starting from the next HOS and GSH sale exercises.

  Safeguarding the basic housing needs of Hong Kong people is the top priority of the Government. With the supply of public housing continuously increasing, the Government is also committed to enriching the housing ladder to facilitate upward mobility for the public. Last year's Policy Address introduced various measures to help members of public, especially young people, achieve home ownership and rekindle their hopes. In the 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive further announced a series of initiatives to assist people from different social strata in attaining comfortable and fulfilling lives."
Monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes drops further in October,2025-11-06 17:00,2025-11-06 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600489.htm,"  âThe Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (October 6) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index (MGI) for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in October was 2.2 per cent, lower than the 2.5 per cent in September. This reflects the continued efforts by relevant government departments to intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations, resulting in the improvement of the overall mosquito infestation situation this month. In addition, the FEHD has strengthened the dissemination of information on the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes so that more citizens can quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation. The department will continue its mosquito control work to further reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).
ã
  In October, all 64 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index (AGI) lower than the alert level of 20 per cent. The decreases in the MGI and the AGI are attributable to the continuous and intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations by various government departments and stakeholders, and may also have been affected by factors such as weather. The monthly rainfall was 31.2 millimetres in October, showing a substantial decrease from the 528.7mm in September and 939.2mm in August. Overall, the MGI for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in October was 2.2 per cent, at Level 1 (indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was not extensive). Relevant departments and stakeholders will persistently intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations.
ã
  Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in October was 1.2, which represented that an average of 1.2 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas.
ã
  The FEHD currently makes regular announcements on gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD has strengthened information dissemination by promptly announcing the latest gravidtrap indexes through press releases and social media.
ã
  In addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of CF, the FEHD has extended the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI falling between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks and, in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together to take mosquito prevention and elimination measures.
ã
  To reduce the risk of transmission of CF and DF, the FEHD continues to step up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts and to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within a 250-metre radius of the residence of patients and the places patients had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

  The FEHD continues to conduct its three-phase Anti-mosquito Campaign this year. The third phase of the territory-wide campaign ended on October 24. During the period, the district offices of the FEHD targeted areas that have drawn particular concern, such as public markets, cooked food centres, hawker bazaars, single-block buildings, streets and back lanes, common parts of buildings, village houses, construction sites, vacant sites and road works sites to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work. To further enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control, the FEHD and relevant government departments have carried out phase two of the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations from May 7. In addition to the work of phase one, including eliminating potential mosquito breeding places, the FEHD called on property management entities to arrange for necessary repairs to their premises to minimise mosquito breeding places and commence adult mosquito control measures by means of regular ultra-low volume fogging operations.

  The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
ã
  Aedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit DF and CF. DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. Additionally, according to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of September, over 440,000 cases had been reported in 40 countries/regions worldwide. The DF and CF activities in neighbouring areas have remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."
十月份白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數進一步回落,2025-11-06 17:00,2025-11-06 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600484.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（十一月六日）公布，十月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之二點二，較九月份的百分之二點五為低，反映相關政府部門持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，使本月的整體蚊患情況較上月有所改善。此外，食環署已加強白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數的資訊發放，讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，並會繼續進行控蚊工作，以進一步降低基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的傳播風險。

十月份，全部64個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平。十月份的每月誘蚊器指數和分區誘蚊器指數的回落，是由於各政府部門及持份者持續加緊採取防蚊和滅蚊行動，亦有機會受天氣等因素影響。十月份的總雨量為31.2毫米，較九月份的528.7毫米及八月份的939.2毫米大幅下降。整體而言，十月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之二點二，屬於一級水平（顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布並不廣泛），各相關部門及持份者仍會持續進行控蚊工作。

另外，十月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點二，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一點二隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署已加強資訊發放，並通過新聞公報及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

為降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險，食環署繼續在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，並在病者的住所及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署今年繼續分三期進行全港滅蚊運動，第三期滅蚊運動已於十月二十四日結束。其間，食環署各分區辦事處針對區內一些受關注的地點，例如公眾街巿、熟食中心、小販巿場、單幢式樓宇、街道和後巷、大廈的公用地方、村屋、建築地盤、空置土地及路旁工地等，進行一連串的清除積水及防治蚊患行動。為進一步加強滅蚊的成效，食環署已聯同相關部門，於五月七日起展開第二期全城防蚊及滅蚊行動，除繼續第一期工作，包括清除潛在蚊子滋生地外，食環署呼籲私人物業管理公司及早維修處所，以減少蚊子滋生地，並開始定期以超低微量噴灑方式殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境以徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。此外，根據世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至九月，全球40個國家／地區共錄得超過44萬宗個案。鄰近地區登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"

Labour sector rallies in full force to support Legislative Council General Election (with photos/video),2025-11-06 16:43,2025-11-06 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600310.htm,"The Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the Labour Department (LD) organised an event titled ""Full Support of Labour Sector for 2025 Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election"" today (November 6) to call on the labour sector to support the 2025 LegCo General Election, and mobilise trade unions and workers to engage fully in the voting to elect responsible, visionary and capable LegCo Members for the labour functional constituency and geographical constituencies.

The event was officiated by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, together with the Permanent Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Ms Alice Lau, and the Commissioner for Labour, Mr Sam Hui. Representatives of trade unions attended the event with keen interest, bearing testimony to the unity and concrete actions of the labour sector on fully supporting the LegCo General Election. There were over 350 participants in the event.

Mr Sun emphasised in his speech that being an important legislative body of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the composition of the LegCo is directly related to the well-being of the labour force. The LegCo of this term has passed a number of labour-related bills, including the Employment and Retirement Schemes Legislation (Offsetting Arrangement) (Amendment) Bill 2022to abolish the Mandatory Provident Fund ""offsetting arrangement"", the Employment (Amendment) Bill 2025 to relax the ""continuous contract"" requirement, and the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill 2025 to better safeguard national security and improve the trade union regulatory regime. He stressed that this election is crucial for implementing the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"" and achieving good governance and effective administration of the HKSAR Government. He called on every trade union which has been registered as a corporate elector and workers who are geographical constituency electors to cast their votes on the polling day.

Ms Lau appealed to members of the workforce to actively engage in this election and to thoroughly understand and carefully assess the candidates' comprehension of labour affairs, the feasibility of their political platforms, and their determination and capability to promote policy implementation. She said that voting is not only an exercise of personal choice but also vital participation in shaping the future of Hong Kong. It is both a civic right and a civic responsibility.

Mr Hui also encouraged workers to take time to understand the candidates' track records and proposals before voting and to ensure the exercise of civic rights by casting votes on the polling day to safeguard their rights. He also called on workers to encourage their families and friends to vote together, electing capable and pragmatic LegCo Members to jointly forge a new chapter for labour rights and benefits.

Union representatives participating in the event unanimously pledged to respond to the call and fully support the LegCo General Election. Representatives from the REACH, PCCW, Cable and Wireless Staff Association and the Cathay Pacific Airways Local Staff Union shared with participants the role played by trade unions in the LegCo General Election.

The eighth-term LegCo General Election will be held on December 7. A total of 90 LegCo Members, including 30 from the functional constituencies, will be elected, of which the labour sector has three places. Citizens may visit the election website (www.elections.gov.hk) to learn about relevant information and vote for LegCo Members of the new term on the polling day."

The event was officiated by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, together with the Permanent Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Ms Alice Lau, and the Commissioner for Labour, Mr Sam Hui. Representatives of trade unions attended the event with keen interest, bearing testimony to the unity and concrete actions of the labour sector on fully supporting the LegCo General Election. There were over 350 participants in the event.

Mr Sun emphasised in his speech that being an important legislative body of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the composition of the LegCo is directly related to the well-being of the labour force. The LegCo of this term has passed a number of labour-related bills, including the Employment and Retirement Schemes Legislation (Offsetting Arrangement) (Amendment) Bill 2022to abolish the Mandatory Provident Fund ""offsetting arrangement"", the Employment (Amendment) Bill 2025 to relax the ""continuous contract"" requirement, and the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill 2025 to better safeguard national security and improve the trade union regulatory regime. He stressed that this election is crucial for implementing the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"" and achieving good governance and effective administration of the HKSAR Government. He called on every trade union which has been registered as a corporate elector and workers who are geographical constituency electors to cast their votes on the polling day.

Ms Lau appealed to members of the workforce to actively engage in this election and to thoroughly understand and carefully assess the candidates' comprehension of labour affairs, the feasibility of their political platforms, and their determination and capability to promote policy implementation. She said that voting is not only an exercise of personal choice but also vital participation in shaping the future of Hong Kong. It is both a civic right and a civic responsibility.

Mr Hui also encouraged workers to take time to understand the candidates' track records and proposals before voting and to ensure the exercise of civic rights by casting votes on the polling day to safeguard their rights.

Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises in Going Global Promotion Conference held in Shanghai (with photos/video),2025-11-06 16:34,2025-11-06 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600511.htm,"âThe Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises in Going Global Promotion Conference, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), was held today (November 6) in Shanghai. The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, delivered a speech at the Promotion Conference. The event highlighted Hong Kong's unique strengths and role in assisting Mainland enterprises in expanding internationally, with a view to encouraging them to use Hong Kong as a platform for going global to tap into overseas markets.

âTo better support Mainland enterprises in going global, this year's Policy Address announced the establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force), chaired by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, and comprising the HKTDC, Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), Hong Kong's offices on the Mainland, and relevant ""Team Hong Kong"" organisations, to proactively engage Mainland enterprises to go global via Hong Kong. The Promotion Conference, being the GoGlobal Task Force's first large-scale promotional event on the Mainland and under the theme ""Hong Kong, joining hands with Shanghai to go global"", brought together a number of heavyweight speakers to share Hong Kong's advantages in different areas and attracted 500 participants.

âSpeaking at the opening ceremony, Mr Lee noted that the country is implementing a high-level strategy of two-way opening up to encourage Mainland enterprises to go global, and the momentum of Mainland enterprises' international expansion is accelerating. Mr Lee said that under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys the advantage of connecting the Mainland and the world, serving as an international financial, shipping and trade centre. The city attracts global capital and top talent and boasts a highly internationalised business environment, world-class professional services, a common law system aligned with global financial centres, a simple and transparent tax regime, and an extensive logistics network. These core strengths make Hong Kong the best platform for Mainland enterprises to go global.

âNoting that the country is expanding the scope of its high-level opening up, Mr Lee said both Shanghai and Hong Kong play crucial roles in supporting regional co-ordinated development and complement each other. Hong Kong will continue to leverage its distinctive advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, actively dovetail with national strategies, and work with the Mainland to create a new chapter of mutually beneficial co-operation.

âIn his remarks on using Hong Kong as a platform to go global, Mr Yau noted that with the unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is able to integrate deeply into the overall national development while maintaining seamless alignment with international rules, giving full play to its role as a pivotal platform and serving as the base for Mainland enterprises expanding overseas. The GoGlobal Task Force will establish an efficient, effective and unprecedented one-stop support platform for Mainland enterprises going global, strengthening assistance for them to systematically expand international operations via Hong Kong amid the ever-changing geopolitical landscape.

âHe added that the GoGlobal Task Force will continue to organise promotional activities across various provinces on the Mainland, proactively engaging with Mainland enterprises. Leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantages, robust legal environment and open economy, as well as a professional and efficient team with international exposure, the GoGlobal Task Force will join hands with Mainland enterprises in advancing into international markets.

âThe Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Ms Carol Yip; the Permanent Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Ms Maggie Wong; the Director-General of Investment Promotion, Ms Alpha Lau; and the Commissioner for Industry (Innovation and Technology), Dr Ge Ming, among others, also attended the Promotion Conference.

âThe Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang; Member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei; the Deputy Director General of the Department of Outward Investment and Economic Cooperation of the Ministry of Commerce, Mr Wang Qi; and the Chairman of the HKTDC, Professor Frederick Ma, also addressed the Promotion Conference.

âA number of Hong Kong business leaders were invited to attend and speak at the Promotion Conference, including the Chairman of Fung Investments, Dr Victor Fung; the Chairman of Shanghai Industrial Investment (Holdings) Company Limited, Ms Leng Weiqing; the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, Dr Sunny Chai; Deputy Chief Executive of Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited Mr Wang Huabin; the Chairman of Ernst & Young (EY) China and Regional Managing Partner of EY Greater China, Mr Jack Chan; Partner at Haiwen & Partners LLP Mr Edward Liu; and the Chairman of Dongchao Information Technology (Shanghai) Company Limited, Mr Wang Chaoyou. They highlighted Hong Kong's strengths in innovation and technology, financial services and professional services, encouraging Mainland enterprises to leverage Hong Kong's international platform to go global, and explored ways to realise complementary advantages in such sectors to jointly seize emerging opportunities in overseas markets. The Mainland enterprise representatives also shared their successful experiences of using Hongâ¯Kong as a gateway to go global.

In the afternoon, two thematic networking sessions on serving Mainland enterprises seeking to go global and innovation and technology were hosted by Ms Lau and Dr Ge respectively for in-depth promotion to Mainland enterprises of the opportunities in going global via Hong Kong. In addition, relevant experts and enterprise representatives invited by InvestHK shared experiences and successful case studies on leveraging Hong Kong's platform in going global. Key issues of concern for enterprises expanding overseas, such as legal compliance, market development and financing, were thoroughly discussed, further enhancing Mainland enterprises' understanding of Hong Kong's professional services and the one-stop support provided by the GoGlobal Task Force for attracting them to seek going global via Hong Kong.

Mr Lee and the delegation will return to Hong Kong this afternoon."
Speech by SCED at sub-forum of eighth China International Import Expo - Hongqiao International Economic Forum in Shanghai (English only),2025-11-06 16:33,2025-11-06 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600514.htm," Following is the speech bythe Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, at the sub-forum themed ""Facilitating Cross-Border Trade's Resilience through Maritime Trade Finance"" at the eighth China International Import Expo - Hongqiao International Economic Forum in Shanghai today (November 6):

Honourable Vice Minister Sheng Qiuping (Vice Minister of Commerce), Executive Vice Mayor Wu Wei (Member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government), Chairman and Executive Director Ren Deqi (Chairman and Executive Director of the Bank of Communications), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon. It gives me great pleasure to attend today's session on ""Facilitating Cross-Border Trade's Resilience through Maritime Trade Finance""and, on behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, speak about Hong Kong's role on this important topic.

 Hongâ¯Kong is modest in size as compared with many megacities, with about 7.5 million people in terms of population and 1 100 square kilometres in area. Yet our significance on the global stage far outweighs our modest size. Rarely can you find a city that can excel on multiple fronts at the same time, but because of our convenient geographical location in Asia, world-class port and infrastructure, an extensive international trade network, presence of all major financial institutions from around the world, convergence of professional talents, and decades of tireless efforts in improving our regimes, Hong Kong has successfully achieved the status of being simultaneously an international trade centre, an international maritime centre and an international financial centre. The development of these three centres is not only closely intertwined, but in fact creates huge synergy and can reinforce one another. Our achievements are globally recognised, as Hong Kong is ranked the world's freest economy, the third largest financial centre, seventh in merchandise trade and fourth in the Xinhua-Baltic International Shipping Centre Development Index.

 So, apart from the strengths I mentioned at the outset, what are the other ingredients of our formula for success? Hong Kong is part of China and enjoys the distinctive advantage of having the strong support of our motherland, the Chinese Mainland, which is the second-largest economy in the world. At the same time, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is a separate customs territory, adopts a free trade regime, has a simple and low tax system, applies common law, has a stable financial system and currency, and is well connected to the world. The convergence of all these advantages has placed Hong Kong in a unique position to talk about the topic today.

Maritime heritage

 Let me begin with our maritime heritage. Hongâ¯Kong's maritime story stretches back more than one and a half centuries, and over that span, the city has evolved from a modest trading port into a leading international maritime centre. There are currently over 1 200 port and maritime companies in Hong Kong, representing an increase of about 10 per cent over the past five years, despite the impact of the pandemic on international trade during that period. Our port is known for its high efficiency, with a container vessel handling time of about one day, roughly half the world average, which underpins our reputation as a ""catch-up port"" that helps vessels make up for delays encountered elsewhere.

 The quality of Hong Kong's maritime services is top-notch in the world. Three out of the world's top 10 ship management companies are headquartered in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, one can also enjoy the services of 11 out of the 12 member associations of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs and eight of the world's top 10 bookrunners of ship finance. Hong Kong is designated as one of the four arbitration venues of the Baltic and International Maritime Council, and is also the sole Asian base for many of the world's leading shipping organisations, including the International Union of Marine Insurance of Germany and the International Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom. To foster a favourable business environment for the maritime industry, the Government has launched a series of tax concessions including tax exemptions for ship leasing business and half-rate tax concessions for marine insurance, ship management, ship agency and ship broking since 2020. We plan to enhance the existing tax concessions with a view to further driving up demand for professional shipping and maritime services. Hong Kong provides an unrivalled ecosystem for maritime services companies to grow their business, which in turn allows shipping companies to easily enjoy first class maritime services. We believe that Shanghai shipping enterprises may capitalise on Hong Kong's comprehensive high-value-added maritime services package for entering into the international market.

Digitalisation and green transformation of Hong Kong Port

 As a constructive member of the international shipping community, the quality of the Hong Kong Port is closely aligned with international shipping trends, particularly digitalisation, smart transition, and green transformation. On digitalisation and smart transition, we will soon complete installation of a port community system to facilitate the flow and sharing of cargo data among stakeholders in the maritime, port and logistics industries for enabling real time cargo track-and-trace for goods routing through the Hong Kong Port. The system also has the potential to facilitate trade finance due to the use of blockchain technology to compile and store trusted data on cargo flows. We are also collaborating with the banking industry to explore leveraging blockchain-recorded cargo flow data in the system to enhance trade financing services.

 Promoting green and sustainable maritime development is another strategic priority. To meet the International Maritime Organization's net-zero emission target for international shipping by or around 2050, we promulgated the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering in 2024, setting out clear targets, strategies and measures to develop green maritime fuel bunkering and trading in Hong Kong. In particular, we target to develop Hong Kong into a green maritime fuel trading centre, and a key channel selling and exporting Mainland-produced green maritime fuels to worldwide user companies.

Commodity trading ecosystem

 Notwithstanding our success in shipping, trade and finance, we have never stopped identifying new growth areas. The expansion of the commodity trading ecosystem serves as a new step to leverage our strengths to further promote the development of the Hong Kong economy.

 Commodities, including metals and minerals, account for more than half of the global shipping trade volume, while shipowners and commodity traders are the key users of shipping routes and maritime services. Their presence and operation in Hong Kong can drive the maritime services industry, and boost demand for related financial and professional services such as hedging activities of related futures products. Creating a commodity trading ecosystem in Hong Kong will catalyse growth across related sectors. A landmark achievement in this regard is that the London Metal Exchange (LME), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), has included Hong Kong as an approved delivery point within its global warehousing network since January this year, and 11 LME-licenced warehouses in Hong Kong have been approved. The establishment of such warehouses in Hong Kong not only will provide convenient, cost-effective and safe delivery channels for related metals trading in the region, but also increase the demand for Hong Kong's trade, shipping, warehousing and transportation industries, strengthen Hong Kong's commodities ecosystem, and lay a foundation for future expansion of related financial transactions such as futures.

 At the same time, collaboration across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, which covers Guangdong Province on the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao, further amplifies Hongâ¯Kong's role as a trade hub. Take the Qianhai Mercantile Exchange (QME) as an example. The QME, a subsidiary of the HKEX with turnover of RMB100 billion over the past year, operates our country's only offshore spot trading platform for soybeans. The HKEX continues to explore the feasibility of co-operation between the QME and Mainland commodities and futures exchanges to strengthen the two-way connectivity between domestic and overseas commodities market participants and attract more foreign enterprises to participate in trading at the platform, thereby contributing to the internationalisation of our country's commodity market.

Maritime trade finance innovation

 At the heart of Hongâ¯Kong's vision for resilient cross-border trade lies maritime trade-finance innovation. In today's evolving global landscape where trade conflicts and supply chain disruptions are reshaping established trade patterns, a more digitalised and streamlined trade finance ecosystem can greatly benefit businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, as they transform their business model and supply chains. In this context, I am pleased to introduce Hong Kong's latest initiative to address these challenges and unlock new opportunities, i.e. Project CargoX.

 Project CargoX is a public-private collaboration launched by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Hong Kong's central banking institution. Project CargoX aims to build a more inclusive and efficient digital ecosystem for trade finance infrastructure, leveraging cargo and trade data to streamline and enhance trade finance processes; developing digital solutions to improve accessibility to trade finance for SMEs; and exploring connections with international data partners to facilitate trade financing. One of the financing challenges in the logistics industry is the handling of extensive paperwork across different regions, which burdens banks and creates hurdles for SMEs seeking loan approvals. Banks can now obtain reliable and secured data through Project CargoX, significantly saving time and labour costs for both banks and businesses.

 By aligning maritime infrastructure, green ambitions and digital trade-finance platforms, we are confident that Hong Kong will construct a resilient ecosystem capable of absorbing shocks, adapting to shifting geopolitical currents, and sustaining growth for the next generation of traders and shippers.

 Hongâ¯Kong now stands at a pivotal crossroads where a storied maritime legacy meets cutting-edge technology and sustainability, but you can tell by my introduction that Hong Kong is ready to advance to a new stage. We invite shipping enterprises, financial institutions, commodity traders and technology partners from Shanghai, the Mainland and beyond to seize the opportunities that Hongâ¯Kong offers: a digitally empowered hub where maritime trade finance can thrive, underpinning a prosperous global supply chain. Thank you."

"Film Programmes Office to launch screening programme ""Food for Thought - A Cinematic Feast"" (with photos)",2025-11-06 16:00,2025-11-06 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/06/P2025110600214.htm,"  The Film Programmes Office (FPO) of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department will present the programme ""Food for Thought - A Cinematic Feast"" from December 6, 2025 to January 18, 2026, screening cinematic works centred on food at the Hong Kong Film Archive (HKFA), the East Kowloon Cultural Centre (EKCC) and K11 Art House, for audiences to enjoy the tastes of life in films.

  Selected films are presented in a ""menu"" comprising of ""Starter"", ""Main Course"", ""Dessert"" and ""Today's Special"". ""Kamome Diner"" (2006) and ""The Lunchbox"" (2013) are two of the films in ""Starter"". Both are light-hearted pieces telling stories of how delectable food brings strangers closer to each other. The other two films are ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967) and ""Toast"" (2010). The former is seasoned with humour while shedding light on racial relations through the story of a white girl bringing her African boyfriend to a dinner with her parents, while the latter is adapted from renowned British chef Nigel Slater's childhood memories.

 In ""Main Course"", one of the films, ""Babette's Feast"" (1987), is about the protagonist preparing a French feast for two sisters, who shelter the protagonist after her escape from Paris to Denmark, transforming goodness and grace into food. In ""Big Night"" (1996), two Italian immigrant brothers go to every length to save the business that they have built in the US. With Meryl Streep's masterful portrayal of renowned chef Julia Child, ""Julie & Julia"" (2009) is adapted from the true stories of two women. The story connects the two lives in two eras with a cookbook and illustrates the sense of fulfilment through cooking. Blending documentary with re-enactment, ""Cooking History"" (2009) traces the stories of cooks and soldiers and joins together six periods in military history with recipes. ""First Cow"" (2019) brings us back to the American West in the early 19th century to tell the story of two men's dreams of culinary entrepreneurship.

 Four films are highlighted in ""Dessert"". ""Tampopo"" (1985) tells the story of a widow apprenticing under a truck driver with mastery in cooking to keep the doors of her late husband's ramen shop open. The richly layered subplots of the story are copiously seasoned with dark humour, satirising society's foibles. Leaning on the side of the absurd, ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover"" (1989) is about the neglected wife of a restaurant owner having an affair with a patron in the restaurant with the help of the chef, folding love and lust into food. In the festive comedy ""The Chinese Feast"" (1995), Leslie Cheung plays the role of an apprentice cook at a restaurant, which is challenged to a culinary duel by a rival chef that will determine the fate of the restaurant. Ingredients running low, staff arriving late, and the hygiene being deemed substandard in an inspection are all happening in a restaurant in ""Boiling Point"" (2021) on the busiest night before Christmas. This single-take film, featuring the actors' precise performances, captures the suffocating tension both inside and outside the kitchen.

 ""Today's Special"" is ""Master Cheng"" (2019), a film about a professional chef Cheng, played by Chu Pak-hong, encountering a café owner Sirkka in a remote village in Finland. While Cheng brings gastronomic delights to the local people, he also finds peace with his troubled past in the scenic Finnish landscape and kindles a cross-cultural romance with Sirkka. This screening is one of the programmes of the EKCC Opening Season.

 Tickets for screenings at the HKFA and EKCC priced at $75 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on November 5 to noon today (November 6), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 182 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

These critically acclaimed plays, scheduled for December this year and February next year, delve into the depths of human emotions through contemporary voices and perspectives.

Details of the programmes are as follows:

Teater Katapult ""The Insider""
--------------------------------------------------



Date and time:
December 19 and 20 (Friday and Saturday), 8pm



December 20 and 21 (Saturday and Sunday), 3pm


Venue: 
Studio Theatre, Hong Kong Cultural Centre


Ticket prices:
$320 and $420




Teater Katapult from Denmark will bring this solo performance to the Hong Kong stage. The story is inspired by a real case, where European states suffer large-scale treasury losses due to an individual tax fraud. By headphones throughout the performance, the audience will be immersed in a 3D binaural soundscape, cinematic audio and multiple characters in their ears, complemented by an innovative stage design and projection effects. This will create the sensation of being transported into the protagonist's mind, witnessing his involvement in devising the monumental fraud, and later his pivotal shift in allegiance to assist police in dismantling the criminal network. The production won The Scotsman Fringe First award at the 2023 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and garnered acclaim during tours across Europe and in Korea.

Song of the Goat Theatre ""Songs of Lear""
--------------------------------------------------



Date and time:
February 6 and 7, 2026 (Friday and Saturday), 8pm



February 8, 2026 (Sunday), 3pm


Venue:
Theatre, Hong Kong City Hall


Ticket prices:
$380 and $480




As one of the most innovative voices in Poland's avant-garde theatre scene, the Song of the Goat Theatre reimagines Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" as a soul-stirring oratorio. Featuring 12 original compositions highlighting key tragic moments, the play interweaves fragments of text of Shakespeare with polyphonic singing, actors' expressive movements and ritualistic staging to reveal the emotional and spiritual essence of Lear in a bold contemporary light. This production swept three major awards at the 2012 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, including The Scotsman Fringe First, Herald Archangel and Musical Theatre Matters awards. It subsequently toured across Europe and Asia to widespread acclaim.

Tickets for the above-mentioned programmes will be available from tomorrow (November 7) onwards at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288. A discount will be offered for those purchasing standard tickets of both programmes.

為更好支援內地企業「出海」，今年《施政報告》提出成立內地企業出海專班（出海專班），由商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺督導，成員包括貿發局、投資推廣署、香港駐內地的辦事處，以及相關「香港隊」機構，以主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台「出海」。是次推介大會為出海專班首次在內地舉辦的大型宣傳活動，以「香港通道滬港攜手邁向全球」為主題，匯聚多位重量級講者分享香港在各領域的優勢，吸引500人參與。

李家超在開幕式致辭時表示，國家正實施高水平雙向對外開放戰略，鼓勵內地企業「出海」發展，內地企業「出海」的勢頭正在加速。在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有內聯外通的優勢，是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，匯聚全球資金與優秀人才，加上高度國際化的營商環境、世界水平的專業服務、與環球金融中心接軌的普通法體系、簡單透明的稅制及四通八達的物流網絡等核心優勢，是內地企業「出海」的最佳平台。

李家超說，國家擴大高水平對外開放，上海和香港都擔當着支持區域協調發展的重要使命，相輔相成。香港會繼續用好背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，主動對接國家戰略，與內地攜手開創合作共贏新篇章。

丘應樺則以「利用香港平台『出海』」為題發言。他指出，香港憑藉「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，既能深度融入國家發展大局，亦保持與國際規則的無縫接軌，可有效發揮關鍵平台角色，作為內地企業「出海」的基地。出海專班將構建高速、有效、前所未有的一站式「出海」支援平台，加強協助內地企業在多變的地緣政治中經香港有序拓展國際業務。

他續說，往後出海專班會繼續在內地不同省份舉辦推廣活動，主動接觸內地企業，以香港獨有優勢、完善的法治環境、開放的經濟體系和專業、高效、富國際經驗的服務團隊，與內地企業攜手邁向國際市場。

行政長官辦公室主任葉文娟、商務及經濟發展局常任秘書長黃少珠、投資推廣署署長劉凱旋和工業專員（創新及科技）葛明博士等亦有出席推介大會。

中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任徐啟方、上海市委常委、常務副市長吳偉、商務部對外投資和經濟合作司副司長王琦，以及貿發局主席馬時亨教授亦在推介大會上致辭。

推介大會邀得本港多位商界領袖出席和發言，包括馮氏投資主席馮國經博士；上海實業（集團）有限公司董事長冷偉青；香港科技園公司董事局主席查毅超博士；中國銀行（香港）有限公司副總裁王化斌；安永中國主席、大中華區首席執行官陳凱；海問律師事務所合夥人劉洋；以及東朝科技發展（上海）有限公司董事長王朝友。他們在會上介紹香港在創新科技、金融及專業服務等領域的優勢，推動內地企業善用香港的國際平台「出海」，並探討如何在相關領域實現優勢互補，共同把握海外市場的最新機遇。出席的內地企業代表則分享利用香港「出海」的成功經驗。

下午，劉凱旋和葛明博士主持兩場分別以服務內地企業「出海」和創新科技為主題的專題對接會，向內地企業深度推介利用香港「出海」的發展機遇。此外，投資推廣署邀請相關專家和企業代表在會上分享善用香港「出海」平台的經驗與成功案例，並深入探討法律合規、市場開拓、融資等企業「出海」關注的主要議題，進一步提升內地企業對香港專業服務及出海專班一站式支援的認識，吸引內地企業來港發展「出海」業務。

李家超表示，香港在「一國兩制」下擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，一直擔當「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色。他在最新一份《施政報告》提出成立的內地企業出海專班已積極開展工作，進一步發揮「出海」平台作用。是次推介大會是成立出海專班後首次在內地舉辦的大型宣傳活動，意義重大，他歡迎更多上海和內地企業，利用香港作為跳板開拓海外市場，走向國際，共謀發展。

李家超亦感謝上海市委、市政府多年來重視和支持滬港合作。自二○○三年建立滬港合作會議機制以來，滬港兩地在經貿、金融、創新科技、文化及青年交流等領域一直合作無間，成果豐碩。

李家超說，上海黃金交易所國際板今年六月在港設立了首家境外交割倉庫，特區政府會繼續與上海市攜手推進兩地黃金交易合作。上海同時積極發展人工智能，而香港正全力發展成為國際創新科技中心，具備科研、資金、數據、人才等優勢，相信滬港兩地可發揮聯動效應，共同打造全球人工智能發展樞紐。他有信心滬港兩地會繼續優勢互補，進一步促進全方位、多領域、深層次的合作，攜手發展新質生產力。"

  In the morning, Mr Lee delivered a speech at the Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises in Going Global Promotion Conference (the Promotion Conference) organised by the HKSAR Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, highlighting Hong Kong's advantages as an international platform for going global.

  In the afternoon, Mr Lee met with the Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Mr Chen Jining, and the Mayor of Shanghai, Mr Gong Zheng. The Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang, also attended the meeting. Mr Lee extended his congratulations on the successful opening of the China International Import Expo (CIIE) and expressed his wishes for its success. He expressed gratitude to the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their support to the HKSAR Government in holding the Promotion Conference during this year's CIIE.

  Mr Lee noted that Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having both national and global opportunities under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, playing the role of a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"". The Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force), proposed in his latest Policy Address, has already commenced its work with dedication, further leveraging the role of Hong Kong as a platform for overseas expansion. As the first large-scale publicity event on the Mainland organised by the GoGlobal Task Force, the Promotion Conference is of great significance. Mr Lee welcomed more Shanghai and Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong as a springboard in exploring overseas markets and pursuing development together.

  Mr Lee also thanked the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their emphasis and support on Shanghai-Hong Kong co-operation over the years. Since the establishment of the Hong Kong/Shanghai Co-operation Conference mechanism in 2003, Shanghai and Hong Kong have collaborated closely in various areas such as the economy and trade, finance, innovation and technology, and cultural and youth exchanges, yielding fruitful results.

  Noting that the International Board of the Shanghai Gold Exchange launched its first offshore gold delivery vault in Hong Kong this June, Mr Lee said that the HKSAR Government will continue to work with Shanghai to promote gold trading co-operation. He remarked that with Shanghai's active development in artificial intelligence and Hong Kong's efforts in leveraging its strengths in research, capital, data and talent to develop into an international innovation and technology centre, the two places could synergise and jointly develop a global hub for artificial intelligence. He expressed his confidence that Shanghai and Hong Kong will continue to complement each other's strengths, further promoting all-round, deep and multidisciplinary co-operation to jointly develop new quality productive forces."
