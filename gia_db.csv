CFS continues to follow up powdered infant formula with possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus,2026-02-04 23:13,2026-02-04 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400974.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department continues to actively follow up on the precautionary recall of certain batches of powdered infant and young children formula in different areas worldwide due to possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus in the individual raw material. The CFS earlier noted through its Food Incident Surveillance System that certain batches of Aptamil powdered infant and young children formula are being recalled by the German authority as the products might contain Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus. The CFS has been very concerned and actively following up on the incident. Following the announcement yesterday (February 3) that a local retailer had sold a small quantity of one affected batch of the powdered infant formula concerned, the CFS's latest follow-up investigation today (February 4) revealed that another trader had imported and distributed the same affected batch of powdered infant formula as announced yesterday.

  Product details are as follows (same product as announced for recall yesterday):

Product name: Aptamil Profutura DUO Pre D 800g
Brand: Aptamil
Pack size: 800 grams
Place of origin: Germany
Use-by date: April 20, 2027
Distributor: HK Wukong Trading Limited
Quantity imported and distributed: 180 cans

  The CFS has found in its follow-up investigation that the above-mentioned distributor had imported and distributed 30 boxes of 180 cans of the affected product. The CFS has instructed the importer, distributor and retailer concerned to stop sales and remove from shelves the affected batch of the product concerned and to initiate a recall. Members of the public may call the distributor's hotline at 6426 1511 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

  Moreover, the CFS is also actively following up on Nestlé company's recall of a batch of Guigoz Optipro Relais 1 powdered infant formula. The CFS has immediately contacted local importer, Nestlé Hong Kong, and a preliminary investigation revealed that Nestlé Hong Kong has not imported nor sold the affected batch of the Guigoz product concerned. The CFS will continue to closely monitor the progress of the incident. Follow-up actions are ongoing.

   The CFS will continue to enhance surveillance of powdered infant and young children formula and to closely monitor the recall matters and remain fully committed to ensuring food safety. The CFS has alerted the trade and relevant department over the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action.

  Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Cereulide is a heat-stable toxin produced in food by some strains of Bacillus cereus. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus or its heat-stable toxins may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

  The CFS urged members of the public not to let infants and young children consume the affected batch of the product, and to seek medical treatment for infants or young children who felt unwell after taking the product concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately.

  The CFS has established a designated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/whatsnew/powdered_formula/index.html) to facilitate public access to more information."
食安中心繼續跟進嬰兒配方奶粉可能含有蠟樣芽孢桿菌的耐熱毒素,2026-02-04 22:39,2026-02-04 23:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400949.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（食安中心）繼續積極跟進全球不同地區因個別批次的嬰幼兒配方奶粉可能存在源自微生物蠟樣芽孢桿菌（Bacillus cereus）的物質而作預防性回收的事件。食安中心早前透過食物事故監測系統，得悉德國當局回收個別批次的愛他美（Aptamil）嬰幼兒奶粉產品，因為有關產品可能含有蠟樣芽孢桿菌的耐熱毒素（Cereulide）。食安中心十分關注事件並持續積極跟進， 繼昨日（二月三日）公布有本地零售商曾出售小量的一個受影響批次愛他美（Aptamil）嬰兒配方奶粉，食安中心今日（二月四日）最新跟進調查顯示，另一商戶曾進口及分銷昨日公布的同一受影響批次嬰兒配方奶粉。

產品資料如下（與昨日公布回收的產品相同）：

產品名稱：Aptamil Profutura DUO Pre D 800g
品牌：Aptamil
包裝：八百克
來源地：德國
此日期或之前食用：二○二七年四月二十日
分銷商：香港悟空海淘貿易有限公司
進口及分銷數量：180罐

食安中心跟進調查發現上述分銷商曾進口及分銷30箱共180罐受影響產品。中心已指令有關進口商、分銷商及零售商將涉事批次產品停售和下架，並回收相關產品。市民可於辦公時間致電分銷商的熱線6426 1511查詢上述產品的回收事宜。

此外，食安中心亦積極跟進雀巢公司回收Guigoz品牌1號配方其中一個批次的嬰兒配方奶粉。食安中心已即時聯絡本地進口商雀巢香港，初步調查顯示雀巢香港未有進口及銷售受影響批次的相關Guigoz產品。食安中心會繼續密切監察事件進展，跟進工作仍然繼續。

食安中心會繼續加強在市面抽檢嬰幼兒配方奶粉，並會繼續密切監察相關回收事宜，全力保障食物安全。食安中心已就事件通知業界及相關部門，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當跟進行動。

Secretary for Health meets with MCHK on amendment to Medical Registration Ordinance,2026-02-04 20:03,2026-02-04 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400755.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, met with members of the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) today (February 4) to have in-depth exchanges of views on the amendment to the Medical Registration Ordinance.

  As a statutory body established under the Ordinance, the MCHK regulates the medical profession in accordance with the powers conferred by legislation, including handling the registration of medical practitioners, overseeing the Licensing Examination, formulating professional codes and guidelines, and conducting disciplinary inquiries into complaints involving professional misconduct of medical practitioners. Hong Kong's medical profession has long enjoyed an esteemed reputation globally. Maintaining doctors'professional standards forms an important part of the MCHK's work. To ensure that the legislation for healthcare professions keeps pace with the times and meets societal needs and the public interest, the Government needs to review the Ordinance from time to time and propose amendments as necessary, with a view to enabling the MCHK to discharge its statutory functions more effectively, including its function in handling complaints.

  Professor Lo said, ""The MCHK shoulders the statutory duty of maintaining the professional standards of doctors, playing pivotal roles in ensuring doctors'professional conduct, continuously enhancing professional standards, and supporting Hong Kong's development as an international health and medical innovation hub. I am pleased to note the continual adjustments and enhancement of the MCHK's work in response to new trends in healthcare development in recent years. These include issuing ethical guidelines on the provision of services to patients through telemedicine by doctors to meet societal needs, and fully supporting the Government's policy to admit non-locally trained doctors by establishing the Special Registration Committee to assess medical qualifications from different places. To date, a total of 150 medical qualifications from different places have been recognised.

  ""The MCHK upholds the mission of ensuring justice, maintaining professionalism and protecting the public. Vested with independent quasi-judicial functions and powers to impose disciplinary sanctions through disciplinary proceedings on doctors whose professional standards or ethical conduct fall short of the required standards, the MCHK has a statutory responsibility and the powers to protect patients' interests. The intent behind this legislative amendment to the Ordinance is to enhance the efficiency of the MCHK's complaint handling, while maintaining professionalism and fairness, and to enhance doctors' professional standards. I am grateful to members of the MCHK for offering their valuable advice on further enhancing transparency and accountability in the work of the MCHK by drawing on their own experience participating in the work of the MCHK. The Government will consider the views received holistically in finalising the legislative proposal, including clarifying various implementation details.""

  The Health Bureau (HHB) noted that the MCHK recognised that handling complaints against doctors was crucial to safeguarding professional standards, and had been striving to address bottlenecks in the complaint handling process in recent years. Under the leadership of its Chairman, Professor Grace Tang, the MCHK has implemented measures since end-2024 to improve efficiency in handling complaints. These measures include taking stock of all cases pending inquiry, prioritising and expediting their handling, and co-ordinating with legal representatives and expert witnesses for better support; enhancing the complaint handling information system; and strengthening the Secretariat's monitoring of case progress to closely track the time taken at various stages of the process.

  In response to public concern last year about the MCHK's investigation and disciplinary inquiry mechanism for handling complaints, the MCHK has reviewed the mechanism earlier at the request of the Secretary for Health and submitted a report to the HHB on improving the mechanism's operation to safeguard doctors'professional standards. Meanwhile, to ensure continuous enhancement of healthcare professional standards in support of Hong Kong's determination to develop into an international health and medical innovation hub, the HHB announced earlier to amend the Ordinance, having regard to the report's recommendations and the operational needs of the MCHK, targeting to introduce a bill to the Legislative Council (LegCo) in the first half of this year.

  In January this year, the HHB consulted patient groups, the two local medical schools, the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, the Hong Kong Medical Association and various medical professional associations on the amendment to the Ordinance. The HHB will brief the Panel on Health Services of the LegCo shortly on the proposed directions and enhancement proposals for the Ordinance."
CHP investigates case of invasive meningococcal infection,2026-02-04 19:32,2026-02-04 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400766.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (February 4) is investigating a case of invasive meningococcal infection, and reminds the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of contracting this serious disease.

  The case involves a 64-year-old male with underlying illnesses. He presented with redness, swelling and pain over both his calves on January 26 and developed a fever on the following day. He attended a private hospital on the same day and was admitted for treatment. His blood specimen tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was meningococcaemia.He is now in a stable condition.

  An initial investigation revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. His household contact has remained asymptomatic so far and has been prescribed preventive drugs. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

  Meningococcal infection is a statutory notifiable disease. The CHP has recorded one case this year so far. A total of 11 cases were recorded last year.

  Meningococcal infection is caused by a bacterium known as meningococcus. It is mainly transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, of infected persons. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream (meningococcaemia) or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord (meningococcal meningitis). Meningococcaemia is characterised by a sudden onset of fever, an intense headache, purpura, shock and even death in severe cases. Meningococcal meningitis is characterised by high fever, severe headache, stiff neck followed by drowsiness, vomiting, fear of bright light, or rash; it can cause brain damage or even death.

  To prevent meningococcal infection, members of the public are advised to take the following measures:


Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly, especially when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing, and clean hands with alcohol-based handrub when they are not visibly soiled;
Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, hold the saliva with a tissue, dispose of nasal and mouth discharge in a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands immediately;
Avoid crowded places;
Avoid close contact with patients who have a fever or severe headache;
Consult doctors about meningococcal vaccination before travelling to high-risk areas; and
Seek medical advice if you become ill after returning from high-risk areas, and discuss your recent travel history with your doctor.

個案涉及一名有長期病患的64歲男子，他於一月二十六日發現雙腿小腿位置出現皮膚紅腫及疼痛，翌日發燒，同日到私家醫院求診，需留院治療。他的血液樣本經化驗後，證實對腦膜炎雙球菌呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為腦膜炎雙球菌血症。病人現時情況穩定。

初步調查顯示，病人潛伏期內沒有外遊，他的家居接觸者至今沒有出現病徵，並已獲發預防性藥物。中心的調查仍然進行中。

侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染是法定須呈報傳染病。中心今年至今錄得一宗個案，而去年全年共錄得11宗個案。

腦膜炎雙球菌感染是由腦膜炎雙球菌所引起，主要經由直接接觸帶菌者的呼吸道分泌物（包括口鼻分泌物）而傳播。當細菌入侵血液（腦膜炎雙球菌血症）或包圍腦部及脊髓的內膜（流行性腦膜炎）時，可引致嚴重病症。腦膜炎雙球菌血症的病徵包括突發性發燒、劇烈頭痛、皮膚出現瘀斑及休克，嚴重者甚至會致命。流行性腦膜炎的病徵包括發高燒、劇烈頭痛、頸部僵硬及嗜睡，亦會有嘔吐、畏光或皮疹等情況出現，若情況嚴重更可造成腦部損害或死亡。

中心呼籲市民採取以下預防措施以預防腦膜炎雙球菌感染：


用梘液和清水正確洗手，尤其在雙手被呼吸道分泌物污染時，如打噴嚏後。當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，可用酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應掩着口鼻，用紙巾包裹痰涎，棄置於有蓋的垃圾桶內，並即時洗手；
避免到人多擠迫的地方；
避免與出現發燒或劇烈頭痛病徵的病人作親密接觸；
前往高危地區前，應諮詢醫生有關接種腦膜炎雙球菌疫苗的詳情；及
從高危地區返港後若感到不適，應立即求診，並告知醫生近期曾到訪的地區。

​行政長官出席中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室2026年新春團拜會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-02-04 19:02,2026-02-04 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400745.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（二月四日）出席中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室（中聯辦）2026年新春團拜會的致辭：

尊敬的梁振英副主席（全國政協副主席）、尊敬的周霽主任（中聯辦主任）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

靈蛇吐故納新，銜玉而去。駿馬昂首闊步，踏金而來。今天是二十四節氣的第一個節氣——立春。一年之計在於春，我很高興今天晚上，與各位歡聚一堂，共同慶祝蛇馬交迭，迎春接福。

乙巳蛇年蜿蜒而去，香港在邁向由治及興的征程上穩步前行。二○二五年，香港經濟達到百分之3.5的按年增長，貨品出口和進口總額分別大增百分之12。這一年，香港繼續成為全球最自由經濟體，世界競爭力上升至全球第三，人才排名和數碼競爭力都升至全球第四，內地和海外企業的駐港公司達到超過11 000家的歷史新高。

這些成就，都是來自國家堅實支持、特區政府不懈努力、香港市民團結奮鬥，彰顯香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的優勢。

丙午馬年奔騰而至，香港社會經濟將煥發新活力、展現新韌性。在馬年，特區政府將與社會各界一道，主動對接國家發展戰略，深化國際交往合作，奮力譜寫「一國兩制」行穩致遠的壯麗篇章。在這裏，我向各位談談香港在馬年發展的四個方向。

靈蛇吐故納新，銜玉而去。駿馬昂首闊步，踏金而來。今天是二十四節氣的第一個節氣——立春。一年之計在於春，我很高興今天晚上，與各位歡聚一堂，共同慶祝蛇馬交迭，迎春接福。

乙巳蛇年蜿蜒而去，香港在邁向由治及興的征程上穩步前行。二○二五年，香港經濟達到百分之3.5的按年增長，貨品出口和進口總額分別大增百分之12。這一年，香港繼續成為全球最自由經濟體，世界競爭力上升至全球第三，人才排名和數碼競爭力都升至全球第四，內地和海外企業的駐港公司達到超過11 000家的歷史新高。

這些成就，都是來自國家堅實支持、特區政府不懈努力、香港市民團結奮鬥，彰顯香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的優勢。

丙午馬年奔騰而至，香港社會經濟將煥發新活力、展現新韌性。在馬年，特區政府將與社會各界一道，主動對接國家發展戰略，深化國際交往合作，奮力譜寫「一國兩制」行穩致遠的壯麗篇章。在這裏，我向各位談談香港在馬年發展的四個方向。

LCQ1: Soliciting business and attracting investment by exhibiting plans of major development projects,2026-02-04 18:50,2026-02-04 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400723.htm,"​Following is a question by the Hon Erik Yim and a reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

The Development Bureau had planned to build ""a gallery to showcase major development projects"" in Wan Chai to exhibit and present major projects, including Northern Metropolis (NM), but the Government subsequently decided to set up physical exhibitions in the community liaison centres of various new development areas and establish an online exhibition on a website instead. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given the view that the dispersed provision of exhibitions on the NM causes a waste of resources and fails to achieve an economy-of-scale effect, hence the difficulty in soliciting business and attracting investment for the NM, whether the Government will consider concentrating the gallery sites in the NM region; if not, of the reasons for that;

(2) whether it will consider appropriately expanding the scale of Innohub and designating a dedicated zone to display the development blueprint of the NM, so as to reduce duplication of resources allocation and attract public attention in a more focused manner; and

(3) whether it will draw on the Mainland's successful experiences in gallery planning (such as those of Pudong in Shanghai, Nansha in Guangzhou, and Qianhai in Shenzhen) to display the development outcomes of major projects visually and dynamically by integrating non-costly technologies such as AI-driven virtual reality, holographic projection, 3D multimedia, and interactive sand table to create panoramic immersive experiences, thereby enhancing the effectiveness in soliciting business and attracting investment?

Reply:

President,
  
The Northern Metropolis (NM) is a key engine for Hong Kong's future economic development. With the fundamental planning now in place and land supply progressively being made available, the development of the NM has entered a new stage. One of the major tasks is to facilitate enterprises to participate in construction and to promote industry anchoring. At the same time, it is essential to foster social consensus to drive the development of the NM.

My reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Erik Yim is as follows:

(1) and (2) The establishment of exhibition galleries relating to the NM would help achieve two major objectives. First, it aims to facilitate community understanding and support for the NM as Hong Kong's strategic growth area. Second, it seeks to attract enterprises and investment by showcasing the potential of the NM, thereby encouraging enterprises to participate in construction, attracting enterprises to establish footholds and fostering industry clustering.

Following an earlier preliminary exploration, we had once proposed the construction of an exhibition gallery on a site at the Wan Chai North harbourfront to showcase major infrastructure projects, including the NM. Having listened to views from the community and the Legislative Council and taking into account the priorities of work and resource allocation, we consider that this is not the appropriate time to pursue the project. In fact, the implementation of such a project would require a relatively long lead time, which cannot meet the pressing need to attract enterprises and investment to the NM.

If the purpose is to only introduce the NM to the general public, the Government has in recent years set up a dedicated NM exhibition zone at the City Gallery in Central. For the objective of attracting enterprises and investment, our experience shows that enterprises interested in exploring participation in the development of the NM often wish to gain close-up understanding of its latest progress and conduct on-site visits. At present, the Government has established Community Liaison Centres (CLCs) in several new development areas (NDAs) in the NM, including Kwu Tung North, Fanling North, Hung Shui Kiu and the Loop. The CLCs for Fanling North and the Loop, commissioned in 2023 and 2024 respectively, have incorporated exhibition facilities showcasing the planning and works of the relevant NDAs and have become the first two ""district exhibition centres"" of the NM. The exhibition content of the Fanling North CLC even covers the overall planning and development of the NM. Following this direction, the Hung Shui Kiu CLC, which is scheduled to have completed relocation and expansion around the first quarter of this year, will also include exhibition facilities introducing the Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA as well as the overall planning and development of the NM. Experience shows that these ""district exhibition centres"" can more effectively complement the on-site visits, showcasing the concrete development achievements of the respective areas to visitors, thereby better focusing on the current work of attracting enterprises and investment.

Looking ahead, we will consider expanding the exhibition content of the Innohub at the Loop to cover the development of the adjacent San Tin Technopole, Ma Tso Lung and even the entire NM. In addition, we plan to establish a larger and multi-purpose core exhibition gallery for the NM in the Kwu Tung North NDA, with the first phase targeted for commissioning in 2027. This will replace the existing CLC in Kwu Tung North, which is of a smaller scale. The new NM core exhibition gallery will be located in Kwu Tung North given its proximity to the East Rail Line Kwu Tung Station scheduled to commission in 2027, offering convenient transport access. The site is also close to the museum to showcase national development and achievements, which has already been designated by the Government to be located in Kwu Tung North, allowing for the future development of an exhibition cluster. Moreover, the Long Valley Nature Park is nearby, enabling visitors to the exhibition gallery to also tour the park and appreciate the NM's vision and achievements of ""co-existence of development and conservation"".

In addition to the abovementioned physical exhibition galleries, we will also establish an online exhibition platform on the dedicated NM website, making use of multimedia to introduce the NM to viewers within and outside Hong Kong.

(3) We agree that in order to attract visitors and enhance the effectiveness of attracting enterprises and investment, it is not only important to provide rich exhibition content, but also to place emphasis on curatorial approaches. In this regard, we will continue to draw reference from the exhibition galleries in the Mainland and other places, planning from the perspective of visitors and adopting multimedia and technology-based presentation methods. For example, the Fanling North CLC is equipped with holographic projection and three-dimensional models to present the overall picture of the NDA in a tangible manner. It also offers immersive experiences through image projection to create virtual reality, enabling participants to experience a ""flyover"" of the Fanling North NDA. In addition, there are simulated driving games, allowing visitors to learn about and experience the development of the relevant NDA and the NM as a whole through diverse formats.

The future core exhibition gallery of the NM in Kwu Tung North under planning will adopt more innovative technologies to create a panoramic interactive platform. Through multimedia presentations and multi-perspective displays, the exhibition gallery will highlight the NM as Hong Kong's new engine of future development, enabling the public to gain a more direct understanding of the planning blueprint and allowing investors to acquire a more concrete appreciation of the NM's development potential."
立法會︰發展局副局長就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-02-04 18:48,2026-02-04 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400728.htm,"以下是發展局副局長林智文今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案的總結發言全文：

主席：

我再次感謝陳勇議員提出議案，以及其他數位議員提出的動議修正案，亦很感謝各位議員剛才提出的寶貴意見和建議，對於我們往後繼續推進北都（北部都會區）發展十分重要。

在此，我想就剛才提及的數個範疇作個扼要回應，並與各位分享一些資訊及最新情況。剛才大家都提出要盡快發展北都，隨着北都的基本規劃已出台，現在是北都關鍵的起動期，造地方面，我們全速前進，特別是產業用地。我們預計到二○二五／二六年度終，可以平整約120公頃用地。大家看看未來五年以至十年，其實這個產出會更加節節上升，二○二六／二七至二○三○／三一年間，我們可以產出另外約900公頃用地，落成約70000個公私營住宅單位，以及約100萬平方米的經濟樓面面積；如果我們再看五年至二○三五／三六年度底，將累計產出1800公頃發展用地，落成約24萬個房屋單位及逾1000萬平方米的經濟樓面面積供應市場。

北都涉及的議題及政策範疇其實相當廣闊。發展局會繼續聯同其他政策局全力推展北都，加快建設和引進產業，其中一個重點工作就是為北都發展制定專屬法例。剛才很多議員都就這法例的重要性及一些內容提出意見。由於北都專屬法例橫跨多個政策範疇，例如剛才議員提到如何管理一些特定要素，包括人流、物流和數據流的跨境流通，發展局現正統籌相關籌備工作，爭取盡快向立法會提交條例草案並在年內完成立法工作。在開始發言時，我提到發展局會在今季就草案條例作諮詢，我們很期望屆時立法會各位議員可以積極向我們提供寶貴意見，幫助我們更好完善法例草案，促進創科以至整個北都不同區塊的發展。

在剛才的發言當中，亦有很多議員就發展大學城的重要性及其定位提出意見。其實自政府提出發展北都大學城以來，已經將其規模由最初提出約60公頃，增加至現時超過100公頃，這些用地分布在牛潭尾新發展區（約52公頃）、新界北新市鎮（約40公頃）及洪水橋／厦村新發展區（約9公頃）。政府亦會因應需要考慮把洪水橋的北都大學城部分進一步擴容。這些大學城的用地最早面世的一批會在洪水橋／厦村新發展區，我們預計第一批可於二○二六年完成土地平整。關於發展定位方面，政務司司長擔任組長的「大學城籌劃及建設組」會研究北都大學城發展模式，以及如何以產業為導向，為三個新發展區已預留作大學或高等教育用地的發展願景和定位作出建議。

北都助力香港融入及貢獻國家發展大局，以及大灣區高質量發展，我們非常重視與廣東省的對接協調工作。特區政府會繼續通過由財政司副司長與深圳市常務副市長共同主持的「對接北部都會區發展策略專班」，就北都的發展作緊密溝通，做好粵港對接，共同磋商跨境發展建設事宜。

很多議員提出我們需要招商引資，發展局會繼續與投資推廣署及引進重點企業辦公室攜手合作，共同推廣北都，吸引高增值產業和高潛力企業落戶香港，亦會持續接觸各界人士包括不同海內外企業，介紹北都計劃和最新發展。

當然，除了企業，亦會向不同持份者，包括香港的年輕人，推廣北都。所以，我們設有北都專屬網站，另外在一些新發展區的社區聯絡中心，我們會陸續加入展覽場地，亦會設立一個專屬網上展覽廳，希望令我們的接觸面更廣闊。

剛才很多議員都提出政府需要以創新思維，拆牆鬆綁，便利企業進駐，所以政府會更主動，透過各式多元開發模式，加快北都發展。當中除既有的原址換地安排外，亦會創新利用「片區開發」模式、剛才有議員提及的分階段開發模式、對產業進行靈活批撥土地、成立產業園公司等。我們希望這些創新發展模式，配合靈活的地價繳付安排，例如分期繳付地價、主動交回將收回的私人土地以藉此抵銷地價或按實補價的安排，提高市場投資及參與意欲。

另外，關於拆牆鬆綁，為了加強對北都大型私人發展項目審批的統籌與監督，做到拆牆鬆綁，政府已在由財政司副司長擔任組長的「規劃及發展工作組」之下，成立北都專案監督辦公室，由發展局常任秘書長（規劃及地政）領導，設有時限和分階段通報機制，以加快審批速度，加速企業進駐。

北都的工作充滿挑戰，但我們一定會全力以赴，將北都發展提速提效，讓市民早日受惠，亦令香港可以因應北都的發展，更好發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，服務國家發展大局。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
立法會：創新科技及工業局局長就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-02-04 18:45,2026-02-04 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400714.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（二月四日）在立法會會議就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案的總結發言：

主席：

我再次感謝陳勇議員提出的動議辯論，以及提出修正案的議員。我也要感謝另外34位議員的積極發言，就推進北部都會區與河套深港科技創新合作區的建設，以至香港的產業發展提出了不少真知灼見。剛才，發展局副局長回應了有關北部都會區規劃的意見。我現在就各位議員有關創科發展的意見，作出綜合回應。

河套香港園區

我在開場發言時指出，河套合作區由香港園區及深圳園區以「一河兩岸」、「一區兩園」的理念共同構建而成。河套香港園區會按照「自由開放、連通內外、便利流動」的基本原則發展，充分發揮香港作為連通內地與世界的橋樑角色及優勢，匯聚海內外創科資源及人才，成為招商引資、招才引智的重要平台，推動大灣區國際科技創新中心建設。

河套香港園區於去年十二月正式開園。兩座投入服務的濕實驗室大樓已有超過60家來自本地和海內外的科技企業及機構簽署入駐，佔兩座大樓樓面面積的八成。它們主要從事人工智能和數據科學、生命健康科學，以及微電子、新能源和機器人技術等前沿科技領域。

落戶的企業主要是看中園區的區位優勢。香港的獨特優勢既有助內地企業「走出去」，也便利海外企業以香港為跳板進入內地市場。我們會以「邊建設、邊進駐」模式，因應市場需求，靈活為企業提供工作空間，讓它們提早進駐，而無須等待整個園區工程完成。

另外，為支援落戶企業的業務發展，園區公司也會提供包括商業配對、投資對接、專業顧問服務（比如知識產權、稅務、金融投資、會計、法律、檢測標準認證等多項專業服務），助力落戶園區的企業提升自身技術能力和市場競爭力。此外，園區還將提供專門空間和財政資源支持初創企業的發展。

為加快香港園區的建設工作，園區公司已選定第一期用地特定地塊並徵求了市場發展意向，我們將於今年稍後時間盡快將土地推出市場，以期透過市場力量提速、提效推進香港園區發展。

與此同時，園區第二期用地的發展規劃布局已完成，兩期發展提供的總樓面面積可達200萬平方米，較原計劃增加約七成。園區將按功能劃分科技區塊，包括生命健康科技、人工智能與數據科學、新科技與先進製造等支柱產業，促進產業的上、中、下游協同發展，打造完整創科產業鏈。

除了加快工程，促進創新要素跨園區流動的便利措施是河套合作區的獨特優勢。特區政府正積極與深圳市政府和相關部委積極研究具體實施細節，爭取在符合國家安全相關法律法規及風險可控的前提下，盡早試行內地數據和生物樣本流動到香港園區作科研用途，用好河套香港園區作為「國內境外」的地區及合作區「一區兩園」的獨特優勢。

按照現時的商討，跨園區的流動會以如「綠色通道」、參與企業「白名單」、數據及物流清單等機制，簡化進出兩地園區的出入手續和審批程序，以及以科技和信息化手段，就取樣、運輸、出入庫、使用、銷毀等環節全程監控的方式實施。人員流動方面，連接港深兩個園區的西面跨河連接橋項目已於去年十二月正式啓動，將有效促進跨境人員流動。為了便利兩地創科人員往來，兩地政府會積極研究使用創新的出入境清關模式，目標是可以讓預先核實資格的人員使用人臉識別技術核實身分，從而達致「無感通關」。

新田科技城

如果說河套園區將主要聚焦於研發及中試，新田科技城則更聚焦於產業發展，將會成為香港未來的產業發展重鎮。作為河套地區的天然延伸，新田科技城具有三大優勢，它毗鄰香港園區，北面與福田和皇崗的創科生態緊密對接，南面連接牛潭尾北都大學城，具有區位優勢。作為河套的天然延伸，新田科技城提供成片新創科土地，可滿足不同產業鏈環節、不同規模企業、不同科技領域的空間需求，具有規模優勢。此外，它享有優越的交通網絡，鄰近深圳，也鄰近三寶樹濕地保育公園，具有優良生態環境和宜居的優勢。通過聚焦產業、人才和空間之間的互動，打造以產優城、以城引人、以人築產的良性循環。

產業發展方面，新田科技城可提供較大規模土地，支援《香港創新科技發展藍圖》所提出的策略性創科產業發展，也就是生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人、微電子與智能裝備、新材料、新能源及綠色科技等，並聚焦以先進製造為核心的香港創科產業體系的建設。

新田科技城創科用地會以三個樞紐、三個產業發展帶（三紐、三帶）發展，也就是由北至南，由河套樞紐、洲頭樞紐及麒麟樞紐，以及生命健康科技發展帶、人工智能與機械人發展帶及微電子與先進產業發展帶。因應相關收地和工務部門土地平整工程時間表，將劃分五個發展階段，從導入、產業生態延展、產城中樞，以至完善階段。規劃上也會結合實際情況，並預留一定發展彈性，比如在南面麒麟樞紐附近，我們會提供戰略留白區域。

新田一帶的新創科用地與河套香港園區將形成上中下游協同發展的重要紐帶，為創科產業提供辦公、原型、小試、中試、生產綜合空間的全鏈條配套支持。政府會按照《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》全力推動有關發展，包括考慮以成立專屬公司的模式與市場共同參與開發，利用市場化資源提升開發速度、優化開發成本。政府將按土地的供應時間表，適時提出階段性發展方案。

其他配套措施扶助產業發展

多位議員都關心構建創科生態圈以至促進新型工業化的發展。政府自二○二三年起已扶植超過500家具潛力或引領性的創科企業在港發展、落戶或擴展在港業務，涵蓋生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人，以及先進製造等。我們將繼續改革求變，在更廣闊的範圍内，協助業界解決發展新型工業化的關鍵痛點，完善創科產業發展環境。

在支援初創企業及匯聚創科人才方面，創新科技署已成功推行創科人才庫計劃多年，有效支援、匯聚了一大批優秀的年輕創科專才。我們已經推出了1.8億元「創科加速器先導計劃」，吸引專業服務機構在港建立加速器基地，支援初創企業。另外，我們已經於去年九月推出30億元「前沿科技研究支援計劃」，吸引國際頂尖科技人才來港發展。

結語

主席，我再次感謝每位發言的議員。河套香港園區和新田科技城肩負推動香港以至大灣區科技發展的重要使命，是支持香港未來創科發展的重要載體，為推動香港的高質量發展帶來重要機遇。我們將進一步強化「產、學、研、投」的高效合作，堅決落實夏寶龍主任關於行政主導的指導方針，抓住機遇，深化改革，拆牆鬆綁。我希望在河套、沙嶺等邊境區域能進一步放寬限制，充分利用好國家資源，先行先試，「多、快、好、省」地構建蓬勃的創科生態圈，打造香港經濟的新增長點，助力香港發展新質生產力。

主席，本人謹此陳辭。"

醫務衞生局局長就修訂《醫生註冊條例》與醫委會會面,2026-02-04 17:38,2026-02-04 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400659.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（二月四日）與香港醫務委員會（醫委會）委員會面，就修訂《醫生註冊條例》（《條例》）深入交流意見。

醫委會是根據《條例》成立的法定機構，按法例賦予的權力規管醫生專業，包括負責醫生註冊、監辦執業資格試、制訂專業守則與指引，以及就涉及醫生專業失當的申訴進行紀律研訊。一直以來，香港醫療專業水平在世界上享負盛名，維持醫生專業操守是醫委會工作的重要一環。為確保醫護專業的法例與時並進，符合社會需要和公眾利益，政府須不時檢視《條例》，並按需要提出修訂《條例》，讓醫委會更有效履行各項法定職能，包括處理申訴的職能。

盧寵茂教授說：「醫委會肩負維持醫生專業水平的法定職能，在確保醫生專業操守、持續提升專業水平，以至推動香港發展成為國際醫療創新樞紐的角色至關重要。我樂見醫委會因應近年醫療發展的新趨勢，不斷調整及優化其工作，包括因應社會需要就醫生使用遠程醫療為病人提供服務發出道德指引；以及全力配合政府引入非本地培訓醫生的政策，成立特別註冊委員會審核不同地區的醫學資格，至今已承認合共150項不同地區的醫學資格。」

「醫委會肩負『行公義，守專業，護社羣』的使命，具有法定責任和權力保障病人權益，獲賦予獨立準司法職能和權力，通過紀律程序向專業水平或操守未能達標的醫生作出紀律處分。今次修訂《條例》的初衷，是希望在維持專業性和公平性的前提下提升醫委會處理投訴的效率，並提升醫生專業水平。我感謝醫委會成員憑藉自身參與醫委會事務的經驗，就如何進一步提升醫委會工作的透明度和問責性提出的寶貴意見。政府在敲定修例建議時會通盤考慮各方意見，包括釐清各項執行細節。」

醫衞局留意到，醫委會明白處理涉及醫生的投訴對維護專業水平至關重要，近年已致力解決處理投訴流程上的樽頸。在主席鄧惠瓊教授領導下，醫委會自二○二四年年底推行措施改善投訴處理效率，這些措施包括重新盤點所有仍待進行研訊的個案，重點加快處理及協調法律代表、專家證人等加以配合、加強投訴處理的資訊系統，以及加強秘書處就個案進度的監管力度以密切留意程序各階段所使用的時間。

因應去年公眾對醫委會處理投訴的調查和紀律研訊機制的關注，醫委會早前已應醫衞局局長的要求檢視機制，並就完善機制運作以確保醫生專業水平向醫衞局提交報告。同時，為確保醫療專業水平精益求精以配合香港銳意發展成為國際醫療創新樞紐，醫衞局早前公布將因應報告的建議及醫委會的運作需要修訂《條例》，目標在今年上半年向立法會提交條例草案。

醫衞局於今年一月先後就修訂《條例》諮詢病人組織、兩所本地醫學院、香港醫學專科學院、香港醫學會和不同醫學界專業團體。醫衞局稍後會向立法會衞生事務委員會介紹建議方向和完善《條例》方案。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-04 17:30,2026-02-04 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400634.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 4), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-04 17:30,2026-02-04 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400635.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月四日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

​立法會六題：控煙措施,2026-02-04 17:20,2026-02-04 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400569.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上何敬康議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

去年通過的《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》實施了多項控煙措施。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於在修例後，法定禁煙區擴大至指定處所出入口三米範圍內的公眾地方，但有意見認為，為平衡各方需要和配合文化體育盛事的舉行，政府應在公共地方設立指定吸煙區，並於特定時段（例如盛事期間）加強執法，以提升公眾體驗及安全，政府會否研究有關建議；

（二）自修例後，每月政府就打擊私煙活動所進行的巡查次數，以及就違反控煙措施所發出的定額罰款通知書數目為何；負責執法的各職級前線人員的人手編制分別為何；及

（三）鑑於政府早前表示會實施地盤全面禁煙，但大維修屋苑的住宅內部則不屬禁煙範圍，政府有否計劃修訂相關控煙法例以配合工地禁煙措施，並研究擴闊住宅維修工程禁煙範圍的可行性，例如於正進行工程或內部裝修的住宅實施禁煙？

答覆：

主席：

「吸煙危害健康」的道理，我相信各位立法會議員以至香港市民大眾，不論是否吸煙者都明白而對此不會有異議。特區政府多年來以多管齊下及循序漸進的原則來推動控煙政策，從而保障市民免受煙草禍害。

就何敬康議員的提問，經徵詢勞工及福利局（勞福局）、香港海關（海關）和衞生署，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）文化體育活動有益身心健康，而且更可發展盛事經濟。香港素有「亞洲盛事之都」和「國際會展之都」的美譽，同時亦獲國家衞生健康委員會和世界衞生組織認可為中國控煙的先驅。文化盛事與無煙之都，不單沒有矛盾，更是相輔相成。放眼全世界，非吸煙人口遠比吸煙人口多，而參與文化及體育盛事的市民或旅客中，不吸煙的人士佔比應更高。真正無煙和清新的環境才能夠提升市民及旅客的文化及體育盛事體驗與安全，從而提升城市的形象和素質。對於參與文化及體育活動的民眾，場地公共地方設置指定吸煙區充斥二手煙，絕非提升體驗，反而破壞體驗。

政府其中一個控煙方向是不時透過修訂法例以擴大禁煙範圍，目的是杜絕二手煙害，保護公眾。現時，舉辦國際文化和體育盛事的主要場地，如電影院、劇院、音樂廳、公園和體育場，不管室內或室外，絕大部分本身已有禁煙規定——自今年一月一日起在排隊輪候進入上述場地時亦禁止吸煙，目標是確保無煙文化體育活動及盛事。此外，《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》（第371章），下稱《條例》，亦賦權醫務衞生局局長按照地區情況、市民和區議會意見並視乎實際需要和可行性，例如因應大型活動，訂立大範圍禁煙區，並設定適用條件及豁免情況。在大型活動舉行期間，衞生署控煙酒辦公室，下稱控煙酒辦，會按情況與相關部門作聯合行動，我們亦鼓勵場地管理方善用控煙酒辦提供的指引及禁煙標示，以清晰傳達控煙信息。

政府理解社會各界對公共空間管理有不同的考量及意見，但目前並沒有任何科學證據支持指定吸煙區能有效保障市民免受二手煙傷害。相反，世界衞生組織表明任何措施，包括通風、空氣過濾和設立指定吸煙區，甚至工程技術包括專門的通風系統等，均不能防止市民暴露在二手煙霧中，因為煙霧中的微粒可穿透任何通風系統並擴散至整個環境，而煙霧中的相當部分有毒成分更是無色無味，對心血管和呼吸系統有直接及即時的危害。

此外，公眾亦有機會因而誤以為設立指定吸煙區就能夠保護公眾健康，就能杜絕二手煙害，相當於向公眾傳遞錯誤的公共衞生信息，更令在公共區域吸煙的行為重新正常化，不利於邁向促進「無煙香港」的長遠目標。

（二）去年獲立法會通過的《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例》，下稱《修訂條例》下的其中一個重點便是打擊私煙，主要由海關根據《應課稅品條例》（第109章）負責執法，相關罰則於去年九月十九日《修訂條例》刊憲後已經即時提高至罰款200萬元和監禁七年。《修訂條例》亦規定任何售價低於煙草稅的香煙必須證明已課稅，否則將被推定為未完稅香煙。海關人員已多次採取專項行動突擊巡查全港多區的香煙銷售點，偵破了多個非法銷售點以低於煙草稅的價格出售香煙。

海關一直採取全方位的執法策略打撃私煙活動，並在全港各區和網絡平台上進行反私煙巡查。前線海關人員，包括於各出入境管制站負責旅客及貨物清關的人員，都會參與堵截私煙的工作。由於他們同時執行其他清關職務，故難以將有關數目分項量化。

為進一步打擊「白牌煙」，海關已完成為期三個月的完稅標籤制度先導計劃，過程中亦有多次向業界作出宣講。海關計劃於二○二七年第二季全面推行完稅標籤制度，以更有效區分已完稅和未完稅香煙。

至於檢控違例吸煙並發出定額罰款通知書則由控煙酒辦負責執法，控煙酒辦自《修訂條例》通過後的執法及人手數據載於附件供議員參考。單單在去年十二月，控煙酒辦共執行巡查3 578次，發出定額罰款通知書691張。

（三）何議員問題的第三部分是關於地盤全面禁煙。地盤全面禁煙牽涉到承建商及個人兩個層面。就承建商的罰則方面，勞福局正修訂《建築地盤（安全）規例》（第59I章），禁止在建築地盤（包括新建樓宇地盤和大型維修地盤等）進行任何有引發火警風險的吸煙行為，從而提高建築地盤的安全水平。而在地盤吸煙的行為，除了明顯會引發火警風險，亦與工作場所的控煙有關。針對在建築地盤違規吸煙的個人行為，勞福局會參考《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》（第371章）和《定額罰款（吸煙罪行）條例》（第600章）的罰款水平及定額罰款方式，並正考慮具體修例方案。事實上，住宅大廈的室內公共範圍，如電梯大堂、後樓梯等，無論是否在大廈維修時被劃入建築地盤範圍，本來已經屬於《條例》下的工作地方或公眾地方內的室內區域，均是法定禁煙區。現時勞福局考慮採取的做法，將會把正在維修的大廈的其他部分，如外牆工程，也納入禁煙範圍。然而，《條例》並不涵蓋私人住宅單位，這是政府推行室內公眾地方全面禁煙時，基於在私人地方的個人生活和執法困難的考慮而作出的決定。勞福局在這次修例時，會參考上述經驗，豁免維修地盤有人正居住的住宅單位。

今日，勞福局局長孫玉菡也出席了會議，以回應議員就此方面的跟進提問。"
LCQ6: Tobacco control measures,2026-02-04 17:20,2026-02-04 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400575.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Adrian Ho and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

A number of tobacco control measures have been implemented under the Tobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2025 passed last year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that while the statutory no smoking areas have been extended to public places that lie within three metres from access points of specified premises after the legislative amendment exercise, there are views that in order to balance various needs and accommodate the hosting of cultural and sports mega events, the Government should establish designated smoking areas in public places and step up enforcement during specific periods (e.g. during mega events) to enhance public experience and safety, whether the Government will study the relevant proposals;

(2) of the number of inspections conducted by the Government to combat illicit cigarette activities and the number of fixed penalty notices issued for contravention of tobacco control measures each month since the legislative amendment exercise; the respective staffing establishments of frontline officers of various ranks responsible for enforcement; and

(3) given that while the Government has earlier on indicated that a total smoking ban will be implemented at construction sites, it does not cover the interior of residential units in housing estates undergoing major maintenance, whether the Government has plans to amend the relevant tobacco control legislation to align with the smoking ban at site areas, and to study the feasibility of extending the coverage of the smoking ban in respect of domestic repair works, such as implementing a smoking ban at residential units currently undergoing works or internal renovations?

Reply:

President,

The principle that ""smoking is hazardous to health"" is one which I trust all Members of the Legislative Council (LegCo), and indeed the general public of Hong Kong, smokers and non-smokers alike, understand and would not dispute. For many years, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has pursued tobacco control policies through a multi-pronged and progressive approach, so as to protect the people from the harm caused by tobacco.

The consolidated reply, in consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) and the Department of Health (DH), on the question raised by the Hon Adrian Ho is as follows:

(1) Cultural and sports activities are beneficial to the physical and psychological health, and can even help develop mega event economy. Hong Kong is revered as the ""Events Capital of Asia"" and the ""World's Meeting Place"", and is at the same time recognised to be at the forefront of tobacco control in China by the National Health Commission as well as the World Health Organization (WHO). Cultural and mega events and a smoke-free city are not contradictory, rather, they even complement each other perfectly. In a global perspective, the non-smoking population far outnumbers smokers, and proportion of non-smokers among citizens and visitors participating in cultural and sports events should be greater. Only a truly smoke-free and fresh environment can enhance the experience at mega cultural and sports events as well as safety of residents and visitors alike, with a view to elevating the city's image and quality. For those participating in cultural and sports activities, the establishment of designated smoking areas in public places at the event venues, which are filled with second-hand smoke, does nothing to enhance their experience. Rather, it would ruin their experience.

One of the Government's tobacco control directions is to periodically amend legislation to expand no-smoking areas, with the aim of eliminating the harm caused by second-hand smoke and protecting the public. At present, the vast majority of the key venues for hosting international cultural and sports events, such as cinemas, theatres, concert halls, parks and stadiums, whether indoor or outdoor, already have a smoking ban in place: starting from January 1 of this year, smoking is also prohibited while queuing to enter these venues, and the aim of which is to ensure smoke-free cultural and sports activities and events. Furthermore, the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Ordinance) (Cap. 371) also empowers the Secretary for Health to designate extensive no-smoking areas based on local circumstances, views of the public and the District Councils, as well as subject to practical needs and feasibility, say for instance, in response to mega events, while setting applicable conditions and exemptions. During mega events, the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the DH will conduct joint operations with relevant departments as circumstances require. We also encourage venue operators to make good use of the guidelines and no-smoking signage provided by TACO to clearly convey the messages on tobacco control.

The Government understands that different sectors of society have varying considerations and opinions regarding the management of public spaces. However, there is currently no scientific evidence to support the notion that designated smoking areas can effectively protect members of the public from the harm caused by second-hand smoke. On the contrary, the WHO has stated that no measures, including ventilation, air filtration, the establishment of designated smoking areas, or even engineering approaches including separate ventilation systems, can prevent the public's exposure to second-hand smoke. This is because the particulate matter in smoke can penetrate any ventilation system and disperse throughout the entire environment, while a significant proportion of the toxic components in smoke are colourless and odourless, posing direct and immediate hazards to the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

Moreover, the public may consequently be misled into believing that establishing designated smoking areas is sufficient to protect public health and eliminate the harm of second-hand smoke. This effectively conveys erroneous public health messages, and even re-normalises the behavior of smoking in public areas, undermining the long-term objective towards a smoke-free Hong Kong.
 
(2) One key focus of the Tobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 (Amendment Ordinance), passed by the LegCo last year, is to combat illicit cigarettes. Mainly enforced by the C&ED in accordance with the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (Cap. 109), the relevant penalties have already been increased to a fine of $2 million and seven years' imprisonment immediately following the Amendment Ordinance's gazettal on September 19 last year. The Amendment Ordinance also stipulates that any cigarettes sold below the tobacco duty rate must be proved to be duty-paid, failing which they shall be presumed to be duty-unpaid. Officers of the C&ED have launched multiple special operations by conducting surprise inspections at cigarette retail outlets across various districts across the territory, uncovering a number of illegal sales points selling cigarettes below the tobacco duty rate.

The C&ED has consistently adopted a comprehensive enforcement strategy to combat activities on illicit cigarette, and has been conducting anti-illicit cigarette inspections across all districts of Hong Kong and on online platforms. Frontline officers of the C&ED, including those responsible for passenger and cargo clearance at all immigration control points, participate in intercepting illicit cigarettes. As they concurrently perform other clearance duties, it is difficult to categorise and quantify the number of officers involved by relevant items of their duties.

To combat ""cheap whites"", the C&ED has successfully completed a three-month Pilot Run for the Duty Stamp System. During the process, multiple rounds of information sessions were organised for the industry. The C&ED plans to fully implement the System in the second quarter of 2027, with a view to distinguishing duty-paid cigarettes from duty-unpaid ones more effectively.

Enforcement of illegal smoking and the issuance of fixed penalty notices is the responsibility of TACO. Enforcement and staffing figures of TACO since the passage of the Amendment Ordinance are set out in the Annex for Members' reference. In December last year alone, a total of 3 578 inspections were conducted, and 691 fixed penalty notices were issued by TACO.

(3) Part three of the Hon Ho's question concerns the comprehensive smoking ban at construction sites. Comprehensive smoking ban in construction sites involves contractors and individuals. Regarding the penalty for contractors, the LWB is amending the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations (Cap. 59I) to prohibit any smoking behaviours that pose fire risk in construction sites (including new buildings sites and large-scale renovation sites), thereby enhancing the safety level of construction sites. As for behavior to smoke in construction sites, this clearly poses a fire hazard and also has implications on tobacco control in workplaces. In response to the violations by individuals who smoke in construction sites, the LWB will make reference to fine levels and the fixed penalty mechanism in the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371) and the Fixed Penalty (Smoking Offences) Ordinance (Cap. 600), and is considering the approach for the legislative amendments exercise. In fact, indoor public areas in a residential building, such as lift lobbies and rear staircases, regardless of whether they are included as construction sites during building renovations, are already indoor areas within workplaces or public places under the Ordinance and are statutory no-smoking areas. The proposal being considered by the LWB currently would include other parts of a building under renovation, such as external wall works, as no-smoking areas. Nevertheless, private domestic premises are not covered under the Ordinance, and the decision of which was made based on considerations of personal privacy in private premises and the difficulty of enforcement when the Government implemented the comprehensive smoking ban at indoor public places. In this legislative amendment exercise, the LWB will make reference to the aforementioned experience and have inhabited domestic premises under renovation exempted.

Today, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, is also present at this meeting to respond to follow-up questions from Members on this part."
​立法會二十二題：支援引進的重點企業在港發展,2026-02-04 17:08,2026-02-04 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400649.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上姚祖輝議員的提問和財政司副司長黃偉綸的書面答覆︰

問題：

據報政府於去年十二月表示，引進重點企業辦公室成立三年以來累計引入102家重點企業，預期該等企業於未來數年在港合共投資約600億元，並創造約22 000個就業職位。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）政府有否掌握該等企業至今在港實際聘用的員工人數，以及當中從事創新科技相關工作的人數為何；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，勞工及福利局制訂的「人才清單」與市場對人才的實際需求有落差，亦有經人才入境計劃來港的學術人才難以找到匹配其專業領域及資歷的工種，政府會否定期檢視本地產業結構與人才清單的配合程度，以及在引進企業的同時，會否將人才清單涵蓋的專業或職業範疇納入考量因素，以創造更加多元化的高質量就業機會；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）有否跟進引進的重點企業在港的營運情況，包括是否已開設研發中心、生產線或地區總部等設施；如有，詳情（包括相關設施的數目）為何；如否，原因為何；

（四）有否制訂策略加強政府與商界的溝通協作，以善用商界在內地的關係網絡，共同做好引進企業的工作；如有，詳情為何；及

（五）有何策略協助引進的重點企業接軌粵港澳大灣區供應鏈及應用場景？

答覆：

主席:

引進重點企業辦公室（引進辦）專責引進對香港有重要策略價值的產業的企業，工作包括物色目標重點企業、了解它們的需要，以及為落戶在港的重點企業提供特別配套措施和一站式服務。

就姚祖輝議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）引進辦積極引進重點企業，尤其聚焦生命健康科技、人工智能與數據科學、金融科技、先進製造與新能源科技及文化創意五大策略產業。這些企業具全球代表性及高增長潛力，能為香港帶來多元化的高質量職位。相關產業對人才需求廣泛，涵蓋科研、人工智能、數據分析、網絡安全、醫療健康、環保技術、創意產業、營運管理、法律、會計及商業拓展等多個領域。

目前已有102家重點企業落戶香港，預計未來數年將帶來約600億港元投資，創造約22 000個職位，為香港注入新動能。這些重點企業不少為市值或估值逾1,000億港元、具備行業前沿技術的企業，它們落戶香港後，有助帶動其上、中、下游企業來港，推動產業加速發展，促進傳統製造業升級轉型，擴大本地產業生態圈，並創造更多優質就業機會。

引進辦於二○二五年四月按企業落戶進度統計階段性聘用成果，當時整體聘用人數約4 000人，最新數據正陸續更新中。部分企業仍處於在港落戶、團隊搭建及業務起步階段，其員工規模會隨着業務發展而逐步擴大。企業的實際營運情況及招聘進度會因行業特性、研發周期及市場部署而有所不同。引進辦一直密切跟進企業在港的落戶進度及人才需求，並提供度身訂造的配套，包括與創科園區、大學及科研機構、商會及專業團體等合作，加快企業在港開展研發及營運。

（二）政府於二○一八年制訂首份「人才清單」，更有效及聚焦吸引不同行業及專業領域的高質素人才。現時，合資格人才如經「一般就業政策」、「輸入內地人才計劃」或「優秀人才入境計劃」來港從事「人才清單」上的專業，可獲得入境便利。在最近一次於二○二五年三月一日更新「人才清單」時，勞工及福利局與各相關政策局及部門經仔細審視，並諮詢各行業組織、主要商會、人力資源規劃委員會及勞工顧問委員會等持份者後，加入了與推動「八大中心」相關的產業，涵蓋專業由51項擴展至60項。檢討「人才清單」期間，政府已考慮有關專業是否難以在本地就業市場覓得有關人才，以及是否無法通過本地培訓適時培育所需人才。自更新後至二○二五年底，根據「人才清單」獲批的申請急增約1 800宗，較此前上升約110%，當中大部分屬就業掛鈎的「一般就業政策」及「輸入內地人才計劃」，顯示「人才清單」能回應本地市場人力需求，緩解專業人手短缺。政府會繼續透過人力推算及跟進調查，動態監察人力變化，亦會不時因應人才需求檢視「人才清單」。

引進辦一直積極推廣並鼓勵落戶香港的重點企業，參與政府推出的各項人才培訓及發展計劃，為企業建立可持續的人才梯隊提供支援，並協助其在港長遠發展。同時，引進辦亦持續促進企業與本地大學及科研機構交流，探索科研合作及人才共培模式，以更全面地培養企業所需的專業人才。政府會持續就本地產業發展、勞動市場情況及企業實際需求進行跨部門協調，並按需要檢視人才政策，以確保人才引進與產業發展方向保持一致，從而更有效支援企業落戶及擴展，為香港創造更多元化及具質素的就業機會。

（三）截至二○二六年一月底 ，已落戶香港的102家重點企業當中，逾50%為上市公司，而12%正籌備上市。另外，75%的重點企業已選擇在港設立全球或地區總部，而約90%已在本地設立或正建立研發中心。

引進辦將繼續支持企業在港設立研發中心、吸引海內外科研人才、提升創新能力；協助上市及擬上市企業利用香港金融平台吸引海外投資；推動企業在港建立標桿項目，接軌國際標準並拓展全球及「一帶一路」市場；促進企業設立財資中心，便利跨境資金及外匯管理；並在落戶初期配對合適項目，加快落地及產業化進程。

引進辦一直與企業保持緊密溝通，並按其落戶進度及業務部署，持續跟進其在港的實際營運情況。由於企業的行業特性、研發周期及落戶時間各異，其在港的營運模式及設施建設會按自身策略逐步推展。引進辦會持續與企業保持聯繫，並適時更新相關資料，以掌握其最新營運情況。

（四）政府視商界在內地及海外累積的廣泛網絡為推動企業引進的重要力量。引進辦一直採取多管齊下的策略，加強與商界及各界持份者的協作以提升招商引資的效率與成效。

在二○二五年，引進辦與商界及不同持份者舉辦及參與多類型活動，包括招商與市場推廣活動逾40場、企業落地及營運支援活動逾10場、商機及資金對接活動逾10場、跨界交流與代表團互訪約20場，以及若干人才及產業相關主題活動。

引進辦與主要商會、行業協會、專業服務機構及龍頭企業保持定期交流，透過座談會、專題簡報及雙向溝通機制，掌握企業在內地及海外的業務布局、產業趨勢及投資意向。同時，引進辦亦透過論壇、專題活動及交流平台與商界、科研界及專業團體保持緊密聯繫，從多角度了解產業最新發展動向及企業實際需要，並加強對產業生態的掌握。

此外，引進辦與不同持份者合作參與交流活動，包括產業論壇及商務交流，並拜訪內地省市政府、園區及科研機構，推動跨境產業合作。這些工作有助引進辦更有效接觸具發展潛力的企業，提升招商效率。

未來，引進辦將繼續與商界合作，加強產業資訊共享及推動跨境產業鏈協作，吸引更多具策略價值的企業落戶香港，壯大本地產業生態圈。

（五）引進辦一直積極協助重點企業接軌粵港澳大灣區的供應鏈及應用場景，以及把握「十五五」規劃建議下的機遇。

引進辦在此進程中將發揮積極作用，透過引進具全球影響力的企業、推動企業以香港為基地拓展內地市場、促進科研合作及產業落地，協助企業在大灣區尋找生產、研發、測試、示範及商業化場景，並將產業鏈從生產端延伸至價值鏈高端。引進辦亦會利用香港在專業服務、物流航運、金融平台、知識產權及合規管理方面的優勢，協助企業在大灣區建立供應鏈管理、跨境結算、融資安排及市場拓展等功能，提升其在區域內的營運效率。

引進辦積極促進企業與大灣區城市的科研機構、園區及高校合作，支持企業在區內開展聯合研發、試驗示範及成果轉化，強化大灣區的創新鏈與產業鏈協同。以生命健康科技產業為例，引進辦成功引進一家來自東南亞的醫療科技企業落戶香港科技園，並成立研發中心吸納本地科研人才，以便在未來開展創新科研活動。該企業發展迅速，其後於深圳前海設立據點，負責產品在大灣區的供應鏈管理，充分體現香港與大灣區城市在產業協作上的互補優勢。

展望未來，引進辦將深化與粵港澳大灣區其他城市的合作，促進創新要素流動及產業協同，並以香港成功案例協助企業拓展全球及「一帶一路」市場。"
LCQ22: Supporting local development of strategic enterprises that have been attracted to Hong Kong,2026-02-04 17:08,2026-02-04 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400652.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Andrew Yao and a written reply by the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

 As pointed out by some press reports, the Government stated in December last year that the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises had attracted an aggregate of 102 strategic enterprises over the three years following its establishment, and it was expected that in the next few years, these enterprises would bring a total of approximately $60 billion in investment and create about 22 000 employment opportunities in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the Government has grasped the number of employees actually hired by these enterprises in Hong Kong so far, and the number of employees among them who engage in jobs relating to innovation and technology; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as there are views pointing out that there are discrepancies between the Talent List formulated by the Labour and Welfare Bureau and the actual demand for talents in the market, and some academic talents admitted to Hong Kong through talent admission schemes have difficulty in finding job types that match their professional segments and qualifications, whether the Government will review on a regular basis the extent to which the local industry structure matches the Talent List, and whether it will include the professional or occupational categories covered by the Talent List as a factor for consideration when attracting enterprises, so as to create more diversified employment opportunities of a high quality; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether it has followed up the local operating situation of strategic enterprises that have been attracted to Hong Kong, including whether they have set up facilities such as research and development centres, production lines or regional headquarters; if so, of the details (including the numbers of the relevant facilities); if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether it has formulated strategies to enhance communication and collaboration between the Government and the business sector, so as to leverage the relationship networks of the business sector on the Mainland and join hands in bringing the task of attracting enterprises to satisfactory completion; if so, of the details; and

(5) of the strategies for assisting strategic enterprises that have been attracted to Hong Kong in integrating with the supply chains and application scenarios in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area?

Reply:

President,

 The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES) is dedicated to attracting enterprises from industries of strategic importance to Hong Kong. Its work includes identifying target strategic enterprises, understanding their needs and providing customised facilitation support and one-stop services to those establishing their presence in Hong Kong.

 My reply to the questions raised by the Hon Andrew Yao is as follows:

(1) OASES has been proactively attracting high-potential and representative strategic enterprises from around the globe, with a particular focus on the five priority industries, namely life and health technology, AI and data science, financial technology, advanced manufacturing and new energy technology, as well as cultural and creative industry. These enterprises can bring diversified and high-quality job opportunities to Hong Kong, and the aforesaid industries have a strong demand for talent across various sectors, including scientific research, AI, data analytics, cybersecurity, medical and health services, environmental technologies, creative industries, operations management, legal and accounting services, and business development.

 At present, OASES has attracted 102 strategic enterprises to Hong Kong. These enterprises are expected to bring in approximately HK$60 billion of investment and create around 22 000 jobs in the coming years, injecting new impetus into Hong Kong's development. Many of these enterprises have a market capitalisation or valuation exceeding HK$100 billion and possess cutting-edge technologies. Their presence in Hong Kong helps attract upstream, midstream and downstream enterprises to the city, accelerates industrial development, facilitates the upgrading and transformation of traditional manufacturing, expands the local industrial ecosystem, and creates more quality employment opportunities.

 In April 2025, OASES conducted a phased assessment of the recruitment progress of these strategic enterprises. At that time, the overall number of employees hired was around 4 000. The latest figures are being updated. Some enterprises are still in the process of setting up in Hong Kong, building teams and commencing operations, and their staffing levels will expand progressively as their businesses grow. Actual operational progress and recruitment timelines vary depending on industry characteristics, research and development (R&D) cycles and market deployment. OASES has been closely monitoring the establishment progress and talent needs of enterprises. It will continue to provide tailored support, including collaboration with innovation and technology parks, universities and research institutions, chambers of commerce and professional bodies, to expedite the R&D and operational activities of strategic enterprises in Hong Kong.

(2) The Government drew up the first Talent List in 2018 with a view to attracting high-quality talent from different industries and professional sectors in an effective and focused manner.At present, eligible talent who come to Hong Kong through the General Employment Policy (GEP), the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP), or the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme to engage in professions covered by the Talent List can enjoy immigration facilitation.In the Talent List recently updated on March 1, 2025,the Labour and Welfare Bureau and relevant bureaux and departments, after careful consideration and in consultation with stakeholders including industry organisations of various sectors, major business chambers, the Human Resources Planning Commission and the Labour Advisory Board, included industries related to the development of the ""eight centres"". The number of professions covered was expanded from 51 to 60. In reviewing the Talent List, the Government considered whether talent of the professions concerned were readily available in the local employment market and whether the talent in demand could not be nurtured by local training in good time.Upon the review and as of end-2025, applications approved under the Talent List surged by about 1800 cases, representing an increase of around 110 per cent as compared to the prior period. Most of such cases fell under the employment-tied GEP and ASMTP, indicating that the Talent List is effective in responding to local manpower needs and alleviating manpower shortages of professionals. The Government will continue to monitor manpower changes dynamically through manpower projections and follow-up surveys, and will review the Talent List from time to time based on the demand for talent.

 OASES has been actively promoting and encouraging strategic enterprises established in Hong Kong to participate in various Government talent training and development programmes, enabling them to build a sustainable talent pipeline to support their long-term development in Hong Kong. At the same time, OASES continues to promote exchanges between enterprises and local universities and research institutions, exploring collaborative R&D and joint talent training models to cultivate the professional talent more comprehensively. The Government will maintain cross-departmental co-ordination on local industrial development, labour market conditions and actual enterprise needs, and will review talent policies as necessary to ensure alignment between talent admission and industrial development. This will support enterprises in establishing and expanding their presence in Hong Kong, thereby creating more diversified and quality job opportunities.

(3) As of the end of January 2026, among the 102 strategic enterprises attracted to Hong Kong, over 50 per cent are listed companies and 12 per cent are preparing for listing. In addition, 75 per cent have chosen Hong Kong as their global or regional headquarters, and around 90 per cent have established or are in the process of establishing R&D centres locally.

 OASES will continue to support enterprises in establishing R&D centres in Hong Kong and in attracting top research talent from the Chinese Mainland and overseas to enhance innovation capacity. It will assist listed and pre-listing enterprises in leveraging Hong Kong's financial platform to attract overseas investment. OASES will also promote the establishment of flagship projects in Hong Kong that align with international standards and expand into global and the Belt and Road markets. At the same time, it will facilitate the setting up of corporate treasury centres to strengthen cross-border capital and foreign exchange management, and match suitable projects during the early stages of settlement to speed up implementation and industrialisation.

 OASES maintains close communication with enterprises and follows up on their actual operations in Hong Kong, according to their establishment progress and business deployment. As enterprises differ in industry characteristics, R&D cycles and establishment timelines, their operational models and facility development in Hong Kong will progress according to their own strategies. OASES will continue to stay in contact with enterprises and update relevant information in a timely manner to keep abreast of their latest operational situation.

(4) The Government recognises the extensive networks of the business sector on the Chinese Mainland and overseas as a vital force in attracting enterprises. OASES has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to strengthen collaboration with the business community and stakeholders, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of investment promotion.

 In 2025, OASES organised and participated in a wide range of activities with the business sector and various stakeholders, including over 40 investment promotion and marketing events, over 10 enterprise landing and operational support activities, over 10 business and capital-matching events, about 20 cross-sector exchanges and delegation visits, as well as a number of talent- and industry-related thematic events.

 OASES maintains regular exchanges with major chambers of commerce, industry associations, professional service organisations and leading enterprises through round-table meetings, thematic briefings and two-way communication mechanisms. These efforts help OASES understand enterprises' business layouts on the Chinese Mainland and overseas, industry trends and investment intentions. At the same time, OASES engages closely with the business sector, research community and professional bodies through forums, thematic events and exchange platforms, to gain insights into industry developments and enterprise needs from multiple perspectives, thereby strengthening its grasp of the industrial ecosystem.

 In addition, OASES collaborates with different stakeholders to participate in industry forums and business exchanges, and conducts visits to Mainland provincial and municipal governments, industrial parks and research institutions to promote cross-boundary industrial co-operation. These efforts enables OASES to reach enterprises with potential more effectively and enhance investment promotion efficiency.

 Looking ahead, OASES will continue to work with the business community to strengthen industry information sharing and promote cross-boundary industrial chain collaboration, so that more strategic enterprises will be attracted to Hong Kong and the local industrial ecosystem would be further expanded.

(5) The Government attaches great importance to supporting strategic enterprises in integrating into the supply chains and application scenarios of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and in seizing the opportunities arising from the recommendations of the 15th Five-Year Plan.

 OASES will play an active role in this process by attracting globally influential enterprises, supporting enterprises in using Hong Kong as a base to expand into the Chinese Mainland market, promoting collaborative R&D and industrialisation, and assisting enterprises in identifying production, R&D, testing, demonstration and commercialisation scenarios in the GBA. This will extend the industrial chain from production to the high-value end of the value chain. Leveraging Hong Kong's strengths in professional services, logistics and shipping, financial platforms, intellectual property and compliance management, OASES will help enterprises establish supply chain management, cross-boundary settlement, financing arrangements and market expansion functions in the GBA to enhance operational efficiency.

 OASES actively promotes collaboration between enterprises and research institutions, industrial parks and universities in GBA cities, supporting joint R&D, pilot testing and commercialisation to strengthen synergy between the innovation and industrial chains in the GBA. For example, in the life and health technology sector, OASES successfully attracted a Southeast Asian medical technology enterprise to establish an R&D centre in the Hong Kong Science Park and recruit local research talent so that it can undertake innovative research activities in the future. The enterprise has since expanded rapidly and set up a base in Qianhai, Shenzhen, responsible for supply chain management in the GBA. This case demonstrates the complementary advantages of Hong Kong and GBA cities in industrial collaboration.

 Looking ahead, OASES will deepen co-operation with other GBA cities, promote the flow of innovation and industrial collaboration, and leverage Hong Kong's successful cases to support enterprises in expanding into global and Belt and Road markets."

Among the sixth batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering 17 survey areas in January, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released six batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in January 2026, covering 62 survey areas; most of the areas recorded 0 per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August 2025, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever (DF). After reviewing the present DF and CF vector surveillance programme, the FEHD has expanded the coverage for monitoring Aedes albopictus mosquitoes starting from 2026. The number of survey areas set up in the community has been revised to 62, with some survey areas renamed. Additional gravidtraps will also be set up at different locations across the territory to strengthen the monitoring of the breeding of mosquitoes. Under the present surveillance mechanism, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in survey areas of the community, with a surveillance period of two weeks. During the surveillance period, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

一月份第六批涵蓋17個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二六年一月共六批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共62個監察地區，當中大部分地區更為0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自二○二五年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。食環署檢討現行登革熱／基孔肯雅熱病媒監察計劃後，由二○二六年起擴大監察白紋伊蚊的覆蓋範圍，把在社區設置的監察地區修訂為62個，個別監察地區會重新命名，在全港不同地點亦會增設誘蚊器，以加強監察蚊子的滋生情況。按現行監察機制，食環署在各社區的監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。在監察期間，食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
LCQ4: Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon,2026-02-04 16:30,2026-02-04 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400562.htm,"Following is a question by the HonYang Wing-kit and a reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

It has been reported that the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2026 (Marathon) received over 120 000 applications, with oversubscription reaching a record high. There are views pointing out that the authorities should optimise the Marathon to accommodate more runners and strengthen its economic impact as a mega event. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will discuss with the Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates (HKAAA) to increase the number of race days and categories of the Marathon so as to expand its scale; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it will discuss with the HKAAA the incorporation of various harbourfront venues into the Marathon's race route to create a ""harbourfront marathon""; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it will collaborate with the HKAAA to jointly strive for the Marathon to be recognised as one of the World Marathon Majors, so as to attract more overseas runners to participate in the race in Hong Kong?

Reply:

Thank you, Acting President.

The Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon (Marathon) is organised by the Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates (HKAAA). Since 2005, it has been awarded the ""M"" Mark status with funding support, and has developed into the most sizable and representative long-distance running event annually in Hong Kong, widely welcomed by local and international running enthusiasts.

The Government is pleased to see the HKAAA, with support and active co-operation from sponsors, various government departments and stakeholders, continues to enhance the scale, level, and international appeal of the event. The number of participants in the Marathon has grown from about 1000 in the inaugural 1997 event to about 74000 in 2026. This year's event also included 20 invited overseas world-class athletes and about 19250 individual runners from more than 110 countries/regions. Non-local athletes accounted for a record high of 25 per cent, demonstrating the event's increasing international appeal.

The Government's consolidated reply to the questions raised by the Hon Yang Wing-kit is as follows:

The Marathon is a successful major sports event that can attract visitors to Hong Kong and boost local spending while enhancing Hong Kong's overall sporting atmosphere. Therefore, the Government supports the HKAAA in continuing to host the event and, where feasible, expanding its scale. We take the view that when planning further development of the event, the HKAAA should carefully consider its development objectives, i.e., whether to raise the event's professional standards to achieve a higher level of competition, or to develop it into a festive, mass participation event by engaging more of the general public and visitors and increasing its quota. Although these two directions are not mutually exclusive, clear goals and directions are crucial for the sustainable success of the Marathon.

The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) has requested the HKAAA to actively study and make recommendations to promote the development of the Marathon, including the two aforementioned objectives. We note that the HKAAA has formed a dedicated working group to carry out related work and hope that the HKAAA will submit concrete proposals within a few months. The CSTB and relevant departments will also provide feedback and assistance. We believe that clear development recommendations from the HKAAA will also help sponsors and stakeholders explore ways to collaborate and support the event.

The Government agrees that the HKAAA should consider various possibilities in the future development of the Marathon, including race route, time of hosting the event and number of participants, etc. Regarding the race route, with the gradual completion of more harbourfront enhancement projects (such as the East Coast Boardwalk), the Government welcomes the use of landmark harbourfront locations for different running competitions and activities to enhance runners' experience and showcase Hong Kong's unique urban landscape. The CSTB has asked the HKAAA to review different options through the dedicated working group, and conduct an overall assessment of factors such as race route conditions, climate conditions, runners' experience, safety considerations, emergency response mechanisms and impact on the citizens' daily lives, etc.

Currently, the Marathon has been recognised by the World Athletics as a Gold Label Road Race, attracting a large number of local and overseas runners. It has already become a well-known international marathon event. Regardless of whether it is the Platinum Label Road Races and the World Marathon Majors, both represent the highest level of global marathon events, featuring a substantial presence of world-class marathon elites. If Hong Kong hosts such events, it will have a highly positive impact on Hong Kong's international image and sports tourism development. As I have already mentioned, the HKAAA needs to carefully study the direction for developing the Marathon. If the direction is to achieve an even higher level of international competition, the HKAAA must study the related requirements and assess the feasibility of achieving them. The Government hopes that the HKAAA can complete a feasibility assessment as soon as possible and establish a clear development direction to enable the Government to offer the necessary support and assistance.

The Government acknowledges the public expectation to expand the scale of the Marathon, optimise its race route design and elevate its international status. We will continue to offer advice and assistance to the HKAAA on various key aspects such as safety, cost-effectiveness and maintenance of event quality so that the HKAAA can put forward concrete proposals for the development of the Marathon. We are committed to striking a balance among promoting sports development, enhancing tourism benefits and maintaining societal operations so that participants, citizens, and the entire Hong Kong community as a whole can benefit.

Thank you, Acting President."

答覆：

主席：

就陳博智議員的提問，現回覆如下：

政府致力推動漁農業的可持續發展，並正積極與業界攜手推進《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》下的各項措施，當中漁農自然護理署（漁護署）會在今年年中推出本地漁農產品新統一品牌，目的是提升產品的知名度，為市民提供優質且新鮮的選擇；同時提高產品的附加價值和競爭力，以增加漁農民收入，這不但有助鼓勵青年投身漁農業，亦可帶動業界加大投資，提升產量、質素和產值。餐飲業更可善用本地食材，開發多元化和具特色的菜單，拓展商機。

漁護署現正積極就建立品牌推進以下兩方面的工作：

（一）制定認證、檢測和溯源制度

為提高新統一品牌的公信力，漁護署已透過農業持續發展基金資助香港品質保證局研究制定認證、檢測和溯源制度，確保參與計劃的漁農戶均遵循漁護署訂立的生產標準和養殖方法，以及符合「安全、低碳、優質」指標和檢測要求。新品牌的產品具可追溯性，讓市民可安心購買。在制訂上述制度時，香港品質保證局已進行詳盡的研究，包括參考內地及海外同類計劃的架構與運作經驗，並因應本地漁農業的實際現況作出優化和調整，以確保制度切合本地需要。

（二）塑造品牌和宣傳推廣工作

香港海洋公園（海洋公園）近年推展「食本地鮮」計劃以提升公眾對本地漁農產品的認識和支持。為借助和善用海洋公園推廣本地漁農產品的經驗和其與本地漁農生產者和持份者已建立的合作關係，漁護署已透過漁業持續發展基金資助海洋公園為新品牌制定一系列全方位的宣傳推廣計劃。同時，為了將青年創意融入品牌中，海洋公園正與香港知專設計學院合作設計品牌標誌，以塑造嶄新的品牌形象。

漁護署已於去年在漁農業諮詢委員會下設立新的「品牌及推廣小組委員會」，負責就新品牌的認證計劃及推廣策略提供意見。目前，籌備工作進度理想，漁護署有信心如期在今年年中推出新統一品牌。

現階段，漁護署正就計劃的細節諮詢業界和相關持份者。待敲定具體的計劃後，政府會向立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會作詳細匯報，交代包括品牌名稱、認證、檢測和溯源制度、宣傳計劃、向業界等提供的支援，以及工作成效的評估和資源運用等事宜。"

Reply:

President,

The reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Pok-chi is as follows:

The Government is committed to promoting the sustainable development of the agriculture and fisheries industries and is actively working with the industries to take forward the various initiatives under the Blueprint for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and Fisheries. Among these initiatives, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) will launch a new unified brand for local agricultural and fisheries products in the middle of this year, which aims to promote awareness of products and provide the public with high-quality and fresh food, while enhancing the added value and competitiveness of products to increase the income levels of fishermen and farmers. This will not only encourage the younger generation to join the agriculture and fisheries industries, but will also give impetus to the industries to increase investment and raise the quantity, quality and value of their produce. The catering industry can also make good use of local ingredients to develop diverse and speciality menu, thereby creating new business opportunities.

The AFCD is now actively pushing the work on brand establishment forward in the following two areas:

(1) Setting up a certification, testing and traceability mechanism

To raise the credibility of the new unified brand, the AFCD has subsidised the Hong Kong Quality Assurance Agency (HKQAA) through the Sustainable Agricultural Development Fund to explore the setting up of certification, testing and traceability mechanism, ensuring that participating fishermen and farmers follow the production standards and cultivation methods set out by the AFCD and comply with the safe, low-carbon and high-quality indicators and testing requirements. The products under the new brand are traceable, making it trustworthy for public to purchase them. In setting up the abovesaid mechanism, the HKQAA conducted thorough studies, including making reference to the framework and the operational experience of similar mechanisms in Chinese Mainland and overseas, and made modifications and adjustments according to the actual situations of the local agriculture and fisheries industries to ensure that the mechanism meets local needs.

(2) Brand building and promotion work

The Ocean Park Hong Kong (Ocean Park) has been promoting the ""Eat Local"" campaign in recent years to enhance public awareness and support for local agricultural and fisheries products. To leverage on and make good use of Ocean Park's experience in promoting local agricultural and fisheries products and its established partnerships with local agricultural and fisheries producers and stakeholders, the AFCD has subsidised Ocean Park through the Sustainable Fisheries Development Fund to develop a series of comprehensive publicity and promotion campaigns for the new brand. Meanwhile, to inject youth creativity into the brand, Ocean Park is collaborating with the Hong Kong Design Institute to design the brand logo with a view to creating a fresh brand image.

Last year, the AFCD set up a new Branding and Promotion Subcommittee under the Advisory Committee on Agriculture and Fisheries to provide advice on the certification plan and promotion strategies for the new brand. Currently, the preparatory work is progressing well, and the AFCD is confident in launching the new unified brand in the middle of this year as scheduled.

At this stage, the AFCD is consulting the industries and relevant stakeholders on the details of the plan. Once the specific details are finalised, the Government will report in detail to the Panel on Food Safety and Environmental Hygiene of the Legislative Council, regarding matters such as the brand name, the certification, testing and traceability mechanism, the publicity campaign, support measures provided to the industries, as well as the evaluation of work effectiveness and the resource allocation."
立法會十五題：學生宿舍的供應,2026-02-04 16:12,2026-02-04 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400542.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上吳永嘉議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

早前有研究報告指出，預計本港至二○二八年學生宿位的短缺數目將達12萬個。為增加學生宿舍供應，政府於二○二五年七月推出「城中學舍計劃」（該計劃），便利市場把現有商業大廈改作學生宿舍時免卻改劃手續，並會預留全新商業及其他土地興建新學生宿舍。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）該計劃開展至今以下各項的數目：（i）收到及批准的申請；（ii）涉及將現有建築物改裝成學生宿舍的申請；（iii）在重建或新建建築物內興建學生宿舍的申請；及（iv）涉及的學生宿位；

答覆：

主席：

為鞏固香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位，發展局聯同教育局於二○二五年七月推出「城中學舍計劃」（計劃），透過放寬發展管制措施，促成私營發展商／營辦商改裝商廈成為學生宿舍，照顧專上院校學生的住宿需要。其後，二○二五年《施政報告》宣布計劃將擴展至涵蓋新建和重建而成的學生宿舍。

就提問各部分，經諮詢教育局後，回覆如下：

（一）計劃反應理想，截至二○二六年二月四日已收到25宗共涉及約5 100個宿位的申請，大多位於市區，包括紅磡、觀塘、深水埗，以及上環等地區。除兩宗涉及於私人土地上興建新學生宿舍外，其餘申請為改裝現有建築物，大部分涉及整幢改裝。25宗申請已全部獲確認符合計劃資格。該25宗個案的負責方正陸續按計劃下經放寬的發展管制程序尋求審批，有關部門亦正全速處理這些申請。

（二）為配合香港作為國際大都會的地位，我們希望計劃下的學生宿舍有一定宜居度。過去20多年，已有不少工業用地被改劃為住宅、商業、商貿等非工業用途。目前仍規劃作「工業」的用地大多保留作工業活動，基於交通、空氣流通及噪音等因素，這些「工業」地帶的宜居性一般較商廈區為低。因此，在現行計劃下，「工業」地帶不論是現有工廈或重建新廈都不合資格參與計劃（註）。

然而，如果現有工廈位處非「工業」地帶（例如「商業」或「其他指定用途」註明「商貿」地帶），涉及擬拆卸和重建或已整幢改裝作非工業用途的申請，在現行安排下經已合資格參與計劃。

（三）我們沒有為計劃設下申請期限，有興趣的申請人可以隨時向教育局遞交申請。

（四）除利便市場改裝現有商廈及在現有私人土地興建專上院校學生宿舍，發展局亦有意透過賣地方式推出合適作學生宿舍發展的用地。

就此，發展局於二○二六年一月二十日邀請市場就使用三幅已平整用地發展學生宿舍提交意向書。如市場反應正面，局方會考慮把用地最快在二○二六至二七年度以招標賣地形式推出市場。這三幅用地分別位於啟德、沙田小瀝源及東涌東，在相關分區計劃大綱圖均劃為「商業」地帶。換言之，按計劃發展學生宿舍將無需另行提交規劃申請。同時，有關用地是已平整和具備基本基建的「熟地」。政府初步估計三幅用地總共可提供約4 500個宿位，但最終宿位數目則視乎項目倡議方提出的設計。用地的主要資料概述如下：

啟德用地

用地位處啟德發展區前南面停機坪區，鄰近啟德體育園，並毗鄰今年啓用的新急症醫院，附近港鐵站包括啟德站和九龍灣站。用地面積約0.74公頃，最高地積比率為5.8，建築物高度限制為主水平基準上80米，最高上蓋面積為65%，而可建最高樓面面積則約為43 000平方米。

沙田小瀝源用地

用地周邊集合商業、住宅及其他土地用途，鄰近港鐵第一城站和石門站。用地面積約0.11公頃，最高地積比率為9.5，建築物高度限制為主水平基準上120米，而可建最高樓面面積則約為10 000平方米。

東涌東用地

用地毗鄰將於二○二九年通車的港鐵東涌東站。用地面積約0.25公頃，最高地積比率為9，建築物高度限制為主水平基準上160米，而可建最高樓面面積則約為23 000平方米。

（五）為加快學生宿舍發展，政府透過宿舍發展基金，提供合共約103億元的一筆過補助金予宿位不足的六所大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學，供興建15個學生宿舍項目。至今，共有八個學生宿舍項目已完工，合共提供約7 800個學生宿位。

至於其餘七個正處於施工階段的項目，共涉6 500多個學生宿位，詳情表列如下。相關大學目前預計項目將在未來數年陸續落成。

（六）及（七）教育局表示，現時學生宿位有公帑資助宿位，亦有私營界別提供宿位。一如世界各地匯聚頂尖學府的城市，隨着香港發展為國際專上教育樞紐，更多來自不同地域的學生赴港留學，而留學生住宿需求往往吸引私人市場參與，提供多元化的選項，例如專上院校可與私人機構協作提供宿位，或為有意在私人住宅租務市場租用單位的留學生提供諮詢服務。

教育局及教資會鼓勵專上院校多管齊下，參考世界各地主要教育樞紐發展的情况，結合高效市場力量，擴闊學生的住宿選項，實事求是地妥善平衡及支援不同學生群組的住宿需要。教育局亦會繼續與發展局合作，全力推動鞏固香港作為國際專上教育樞紐地位的政策目標，並且透過拆牆鬆綁，協助私人市場增加專上院校學生宿位供應。由於籌備及發展學生宿舍項目需時，加上包括有交給市場推動的環節，政府未有就此訂立績效指標。

註：值得一提的是，由於計劃下合資格的學生宿舍必須符合適用於住用樓宇的天然照明與通風標準（包括宿舍房間的任何部分與窗戶的距離都不得超過九米等），而現有工廈的樓面積往往較大，令不少樓面無法改裝成宿舍房間，未能善用所有空間，因此改裝現有工廈成為學生宿舍的商業性亦有限。"
LCQ15: Student hostel supply,2026-02-04 16:12,2026-02-04 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400545.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Jimmy Ng and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

As pointed out earlier on in a research report, a shortfall of 120 000 student hostel places is projected by 2028. To increase student hostel supply, the Government launched the Hostels in the City Scheme (the Scheme) in July 2025 to facilitate the market in converting existing commercial buildings into student hostels by obviating the need for rezoning, and will also earmark new sites (zoned as commercial or otherwise) for building new hostels. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of the following items since the inception of the Scheme: (i) applications received and approved; (ii) applications involving the conversion of existing buildings into student hostels; (iii) applications for the provision of student hostels in redeveloped or newly constructed buildings; and (iv) student hostel places involved;

(2) whether it will consider extending the scope of the Scheme to allow participation of landlords who intend to redevelop their industrial buildings into new student hostels; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether it will consider regularising the Scheme; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) of the relevant details of each of the new sites (zoned as commercial or otherwise) earmarked for building new hostels, such as their district of location, size, and available number of student hostel places;

(5) given that, according to a paper submitted by the Government to the Panel on Education of this Council on October 3 last year, seven hostel projects under the Hostel Development Fund are under construction, whether such projects can be completed as scheduled; if not, of the numbers of student hostel places involved and the reasons for the failure to complete such projects as scheduled (set out by hostel project);

(6) whether it will introduce further measures to increase student hostel supply; if so, of the details (including the estimated increase in student hostel places); if not, the reasons for that; and

(7) whether it will establish performance indicators on increasing student hostel supply; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President:

To consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international post-secondary education hub, the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Education Bureau (EDB) jointly launched the Hostels in the City Scheme (the Scheme) in July 2025 to facilitate private developers/operators in converting commercial buildings into student hostels through relaxing development control in order to address the accommodation needs of post-secondary students. Subsequently, the 2025 Policy Address announced that the Scheme would expand to cover newly built and redeveloped student hostels as well.

In respect of the various parts of the question, having consulted the EDB, the reply is as follows:

(1) The Scheme is well-received. As at February 4, 2026, 25 applications involving around 5 100 hostel places have been received, most of which are located in the urban areas, including Hung Hom, Kwun Tong, Sham Shui Po, Sheung Wan and other districts. Apart from two applications which involve the construction of new student hostels on private land, the remaining applications are for converting existing buildings, most of which are wholesale conversion cases. All 25 applications have been confirmed to be eligible under the Scheme. The proponents of these 25 cases are now seeking approvals under development control procedures that the Scheme has helped relax, while the relevant departments are processing these applications at full steam.

(2) Having regard to Hong Kong's status as an international metropolis, we hope that the student hostels under the Scheme are of a certain degree of livability. In the past twenty-some years, a considerable amount of industrial land has been rezoned for non-industrial uses such as residential, commercial, and business uses. Sites which are currently still zoned as ""Industrial"" (""I"") are mostly preserved for industrial activities. Due to factors such as traffic, air ventilation and noise, the livability of these ""I"" zones is generally lower than that of areas with commercial buildings. Therefore, under the current Scheme, be it an existing industrial building or a new redeveloped building, applications involving ""I"" zones are not eligible under the Scheme (Note).

However, if the existing industrial building is located in non-""I"" zones, such as ""Commercial"" (""C"") or ""Other Specified Use"" annotated ""Business"" zones, applications involving proposed demolition and redevelopment or having undergone wholesale conversion into non-industrial use are already eligible under the Scheme according to the prevailing arrangements.

(3) We have not laid down an application deadline for the Scheme and interested applicants may submit applications to the EDB anytime.

(4) Besides facilitating the market in converting existing commercial buildings and constructing post-secondary student hostels on existing private land, the DEVB also plans to put up suitable sites for student hostel development through land sale.

As such, on January 20, 2026, the DEVB invited the market to submit expressions of interest for student hostel development on three formed sites. If the market response is positive, the DEVB would consider making available these sites to the market by land sale through tender in 2026-27 the earliest. These three sites are located in Kai Tak, Siu Lek Yuen (Shatin), and Tung Chung East respectively, and are all zoned ""C"" on the relevant Outline Zoning Plans. In other words, developing student hostels under the Scheme would not require further planning applications. The relevant sites are also ""developable land"" that have been formed and equipped with basic infrastructure. The Government's preliminary estimate is that altogether, around 4 500 beds can be provided on the three sites, but the actual bed numbers will depend on the design of the project proponents. The key information of the sites is summarised as below:

Site in Kai Tak

The site is located at the former South Apron area of the Kai Tak Development Area, near the Kai Tak Sports Park and adjacent to the New Acute Hospital commencing operation this year. Nearby MTR stations include Kai Tak Station and Kowloon Bay Station. Its site area is around 0.74 hectares (ha) and is subject to a maximum plot ratio (PR) of 5.8, a building height restriction (BHR) of 80 metres above Principal Datum (mPD), a maximum site coverage of 65 per cent, and a maximum gross floor area (GFA) of around 43 000 square metres (sq m).

Site in Siu Lek Yuen, Shatin

The immediate area of the site is intermixed with commercial, residential, and other uses and is in proximity to the MTR City One Station and Shek Mun Station. Of around 0.11 ha, the site is subject to a maximum PR of 9.5, a BHR of 120mPD, and a maximum GFA of around 10000 sq m.

Site in Tung Chung East

The site is adjacent to the MTR Tung Chung East Station commencing operation in 2029. Its site area is around 0.25 ha and is subject to a maximum PR of 9, a BHR of 160mPD, and a maximum GFA of around 23 000 sq m.

(5) In order to expedite the development of student hostels, the Government has provided one-off capital grants of about $10.3 billion in total under the Hostel Development Fund (HDF) for six University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities with hostel shortfalls to carry out 15 student hostel projects. So far, eight projects have been completed, providing a total of around 7 800 student hostel places.

As for the remaining seven hostel projects with construction works under progress, about 6 500 student hostel places are involved and the details are tabulated below. The relevant universities anticipate the projects to be completed gradually over the next few years.

(6) and (7) According to the EDB, currently, the student hostel places comprise both publicly-funded places and places provided by the private sector. Similar to other cities with clusters of top universities, Hong Kong's development into an international post-secondary education hub will attract more students from different geographical regions to study in Hong Kong. The demand for non-local student accommodation often attracts the private sector's participation, providing diversified options. For example, post-secondary institutions may collaborate with the private sector to provide hostel places or offer consulting services to non-local students seeking accommodation in the private residential rental market.

The EDB and the UGC encourage post-secondary institutions to adopt a multi-pronged approach to broaden students' accommodation options by making reference to the development of other major education hubs around the world and leveraging efficient market forces. The universities should support the accommodation needs of different student groups in a pragmatic, balanced, and appropriate manner. The EDB will also continue to collaborate with the DEVB, promoting the policy objective of consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international post-secondary education hub at full steam, and facilitating the private market to increase post-secondary student hostel supply through streamlining development control. As the planning and development of student hostel projects take time, coupled with the private sector participation element, the Government has not set a key performance indicator for this.

Note: It is worth mentioning that since student hostels eligible under the Scheme must fulfil the natural lighting and ventilation requirements applicable to domestic buildings, including that the distance between any parts of a hostel room and the window should not be over 9 metres, and the floor plate of existing industrial buildings are often relatively large, a substantial amount of floor area cannot be converted into hostel rooms, which is sub-optimal in terms of space utilisation. Therefore, the commercial viability of converting existing industrial buildings into student hostels is also limited."

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2026-02-04 15:55,2026-02-04 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400582.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on February 3 to noon today (February 4), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 241 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 201 743 samples of food imported from Japan (including 129 334 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 44 472 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."
立法會十八題：支援長者及照顧者,2026-02-04 15:42,2026-02-04 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400304.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上周小松議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於二○二五年四月起將「地區服務及關愛隊伍—支援長者及照顧者計劃」（該計劃）擴展至全港，為有需要的長者及照顧者提供支援。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）自二○二五年四月一日至今，各區「地區服務及關愛隊伍」（關愛隊）就該計劃所探訪或接觸的住户數目為何，並按區議會分區及服務對象類別（即（i）獨老住户、（ii）雙老住户、（iii）護老者，以及（iv）殘疾人士照顧者）列出分項數字及百分比；

（註：其他服務包括轉介到地區福利辦事處安排福利服務、轉介接受社會服務單位舉辦的活動或提供的社區資源等。）

現時社會福利署（社署）沒有將上述轉介個案按住戶及照顧者類別作分類統計。由於關愛隊會按照個案的實際需要，直接轉介住戶接受相應的福利服務，因此一般來說不會將個案轉介至照顧者支援專線，但會向住戶介紹該專線，並鼓勵他們有需要時致電專線求助。

除了上述福利服務轉介外，截至二○二五年十二月底，全港有超過2700個住戶經關愛隊在該計劃下轉介而獲資助安裝「平安鐘」。至於由關愛隊轉介有需要住戶申請輔助器材亦有1085宗。

（三）及（五）勞工及福利局及社署於二○二五年七月分別推行了兩個試點計劃。在其中一個計劃下，社署與房屋署透過整合兩個部門的數據，識別出較年長、較缺乏社區支援的獨老／雙老高風險住戶，以及護老者和殘疾人士照顧者的高風險住戶，並委託關愛隊接觸及探訪他們、表達關懷及提供適切支援。這個計劃的目的是為高風險但未接受社福服務支援的群組建立社區支援網。我們已於二○二五年九月將這項試點計劃擴展至全港18區，涉及約55 000個高風險住戶。截至二○二五年十二月底，關愛隊在計劃下已接觸或探訪超過27 000個高風險住戶。

另一個試點計劃是在二○二五年七月建立首階段的「支援照顧者數據平台」，目的是為入院照顧者提供緊急支援，並幫助照顧其家中的被照顧者。我們初步連結了社署、醫院管理局（醫管局）及房屋署的數據，當社署從醫管局的通報機制得悉有關住戶的照顧者因入院而出現照顧風險時，會安排人員主動接觸被照顧者，按其需要提供緊急支援，例如暫託及送餐服務等，務求及早介入。截至二○二五年十二月底，社署已聯絡超過3 100宗照顧者個案，當中確認三宗個案需要即時緊急支援。至於其他個案，社署亦已提供社福單位聯繫方法，以便有需要時為被照顧者提供支援。政府往後會將相關數據庫系統化，並逐步擴展覆蓋範圍，下一步目標是涵蓋居於香港房屋協會公屋單位及「三無大廈」的高風險住戶。

（四）在「地區服務及關愛隊伍—支援長者及照顧者計劃」擴展至全港18區前，社署已為全港18區超過450隊關愛隊舉辦共44場簡介會及培訓講座，內容包括該計劃的服務內容及模式、基本溝通及探訪技巧、如何識別住戶需要、認識當區的福利服務資源及轉介流程，以及如何利用租戶資訊管理平台收集資料和管理服務記錄等。

此外，各所地區福利辦事處亦設有指定聯絡人，與關愛隊保持緊密聯繫，按需要提供專業意見及支援。該計劃推展至今，運作大致暢順。

（六）社署自二○二三年十月起推行「與照顧者同行」計劃，透過社署津助的長者中心及康復服務單位，為前線物業管理人員提供培訓，讓他們掌握如何辨識及協助有需要的長者、殘疾人士及照顧者，並熟悉區內福利服務的資訊，以便在有需要時能及早聯繫社區資源。計劃推出至今，共有超過420個物業管理公司／業主立案法團已參與計劃，覆蓋全港超過3 750座屋苑樓宇，接受培訓的前線物業管理人員累計超過11 000人次。

物業管理公司屬自願參與計劃，並負責安排前線物管人員接受培訓，重點在於吸引更多物業管理公司／業主立案法團參與，提升物管人員辨識有需要的住客的能力和意識。而收集轉介數字涉及額外資源和行政工作，或會影響物業管理公司的參與意欲，有違計劃的原意。

培訓單位與物業管理公司及人員在每次培訓後均會檢視成效。社署會繼續透過收集持份者意見，評估培訓計劃在支援照顧者方面的成效。"
LCQ18: Supporting elderly persons and carers,2026-02-04 15:42,2026-02-04 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400312.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chau Siu-chung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

  The Government has, starting in April 2025, extended the District Services and Community Care Teams - Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers (the Scheme) to across the territory to provide support to elderly persons and carers in need. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of households visited or contacted by the District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams) in various districts in connection with the Scheme since April 1, 2025, with a breakdown by District Council (DC) district and type of target service user (i.e. (i) singleton elderly households, (ii) doubleton elderly households, (iii) carers of elderly persons, and (iv) carers of persons with disabilities (PWDs)), together with a breakdown of the figures and percentages;

(2) of the following information on the referrals for support services made by Care Teams in various districts to the service targets of the Scheme since April 1, 2025: (i) the number of cases referred to social welfare service units for follow-up (set out by type of welfare service), (ii) the number of cases referred to the Designated Hotline for Care Support for follow-up, (iii) the number of cases in which eligible elderly persons and PWDs are referred to install the Safety Bell; and (iv) the number of cases referred to persons in need for applications for assistive devices, with a breakdown by DC district and the types of service targets mentioned in (1);

(3) among the cases referred to social welfare service units for follow-as mentioned in (2)(i), of the number of cases first identified as high-risk cases and their share of the percentage of the total number of cases referred;

(4) of the following information on the specialised training provided by the authorities to the Care Teams in response to the Scheme since April 1, 2025: (i) the names of the training programmes, (ii) the training format, (iii) the number of class hours, (iv) the names of the training institutions, (v) the number of trainees, and (vi) the means of assessing the effectiveness of the training programmes;

(5) as the 2025 Policy Address proposes expanding the Carer Support Data Platform (Data Platform) to connect data from more Government departments and public organisations, of the current progress and timetable of the relevant work; the respective numbers of elderly persons and carers currently covered by the Data Platform; and

(6) given that, in its written reply to a question raised by the Panel on Welfare Services of this Council in June 2025, the Government indicated that the Social Welfare Department did not maintain records of the number of elderly persons or carers in need identified and assisted by property management personnel under the Support for Carers Project (the Project), whether the authorities will collect such data in future to facilitate assessment of the actual effectiveness of the Project in supporting elderly persons or carers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that and the alternative assessment methods?

Reply:

President,

  The Government launched the District Services and Community Care Teams - Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers (the Scheme) in March 2024 on a pilot basis in Tsuen Wan and Southern District. The Scheme was extended to all 18 districts of Hong Kong in April 2025. More than 450 Care Teams across the territory have been assisting in, through visits and contacts, identifying households of singleton/doubleton elderly persons, carers of elderly persons and carers of persons with disabilities in need. Care Teams have provided care and support to these households, and referred elderly persons and carers in need to social welfare service units so that they can receive suitable support.

  Our reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1)As at end-December 2025, Care Teams had visited or contacted 79 342 households in need under the Scheme, distribution as follows:

(Note: Other services include referrals to the District Social Welfare Offices for welfare services, and referrals to activities or community resources provided by social service units)

  Currently, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) does not categorise the aforementioned referral cases by household or carer type. In general, Care Teams would not refer the cases to the Designated Hotline for Carer Support as relevant households would be referred direct to respective welfare services based on their actual needs. That said, Care Teams would introduce the Hotline to these households and encourage them to call for assistance when necessary.

  In addition to the aforesaid welfare service referrals, as at end-December 2025, over 2 700 households across the territory had received subsidies for the installation and service of emergency alarm system through referrals by Care Teams under this Scheme. Care Teams had also referred 1 085 households in need to apply for assistive devices.

(3) and (5) The Labour and Welfare Bureau and the SWD launched two pilot schemes in July 2025 respectively. Under one of the schemes, the SWD and Housing Department (HD) have identified, through consolidation of data from the two departments, high-risk households comprising singleton/doubleton elderly persons that are relatively older and lack community support, as well as high-risk households with carers of elderly persons or carers of persons with disabilities. We have then deployed Care Teams to contact and visit these households, and provide them with care and suitable support. This scheme aims to establish a community support network for high-risk groups which have yet to receive social welfare service support. In September 2025, we expanded this pilot scheme to all 18 districts across the territory, covering approximately 55 000 high-risk households. As at end-December 2025, Care Teams had contacted or visited over 27 000 high-risk households under the scheme.

  Another pilot scheme is about establishing the first phase of the Carer Support Data Platform in July 2025. The objective is to provide emergency support to hospitalised carers and assist them in looking after their care recipients at home. We have initially connected data from the SWD, the Hospital Authority (HA) and the HD. When the SWD learns from the HA's notification mechanism that a carer is hospitalised and hence the relevant household may be at risk, we will proactively contact the care recipient and provide emergency support tailored to their needs, such as respite and meal delivery services, to achieve early intervention. As at end-December 2025, the SWD had contacted over 3 100 carer cases, with three cases identified as cases requiring immediate emergency support. For the remaining cases, the SWD provided them with contact details of social welfare units so that support for care recipients could be provided when needed. In future, Government will systematise the relevant database and progressively expand its coverage, and the next target is to include high-risk households living in Hong Kong Housing Society public rental units and ""three-nil"" buildings.

(4)Before the District Services and Community Care Teams - Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers was expanded to all 18 districts across the territory, the SWD had already held 44 briefing sessions and training seminars for more than 450 Care Teams across all 18 districts. The training covered the Scheme's service content and model, basic communication and visitation skills, methods to identify households' needs, familiarisation with welfare service resources and referral procedures in the district, and instruction on using the tenant information management platform to collect data and manage service records, etc.

  In addition, each District Social Welfare Office has a designated contact person who maintains close contact with Care Teams and provides professional advice and support as needed. The Scheme has been operating smoothly so far.

(6) The SWD launched the ""Support for Carers Project"" (the Project) in October 2023. Through the SWD's subvented centres for the elderly and rehabilitation service units, the Project provides training for frontline property management personnel (PMP), equips them with the skills to identify and assist needy elderly persons, persons with disabilities and their carers, and provides them with information on welfare services in the community so that the PMP can promptly leverage community resources when necessary. Over 420 property management companies/owners' corporations have participated in the Project since its launch, covering more than 3 750 residential buildings across the territory. Over 11 000 frontline PMP have received training.

  Property management companies participate in the Project on a voluntary basis and are responsible for arranging training for frontline property management staff. The focus of this Project is to attract more property management companies/owners' corporations to participate, thereby enhancing the ability and awareness of PMP to identify households in need. In this sense, collection of referral data may dampen the willingness of property management companies to participate due to additional resources and administrative burden, thereby undermining the original intent of the Project.

  Training providers, property management companies and personnel will review the effectiveness of the training after each session. The SWD will continue to evaluate, by collecting feedback from stakeholders, the effectiveness of the training programmes in supporting carers."
​財政司司長出席立法會前廳交流會後會見傳媒談話內容（附圖／短片）,2026-02-04 15:40,2026-02-04 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400577.htm,"財政司司長陳茂波今日（二月四日）上午聯同主要官員、立法會代理主席陳振英和事務委員會主席，出席立法會前廳交流會後會見傳媒。以下是陳茂波會見傳媒的談話內容：

財政司司長：各位傳媒朋友、各位巿民，大家好，早晨。首先感謝陳振英代主席和立法會同事的悉心安排，讓我和幾位局長以及公務員同事今早來到立法會前廳，與四個與經濟發展密切相關的事務委員會的委員，約六、七十位議員，進行互動交流。

這次是新一屆立法會在組成以後首次召開的前廳交流會，大家都暢所欲言、積極表達意見，為我們往後的工作建言獻策。

今日的交流會討論的焦點明確——主動對接國家的「十五五」規劃，融入和服務國家發展大局。去年十月，二十屆四中全會通過了「十五五」規劃的建議，其中就着香港的部分，提出要「鞏固提升香港國際金融、航運、貿易中心的地位，支持香港建設國際創新科技中心。」

建議提出的，既是國家在「十五五」期間對香港工作的明確要求，也是為香港下一階段社會經濟提速增量發展點明了方向。國家對香港堅實支持，特區政府和立法會必須攜手協作、搶抓機遇，帶領社會上下各界凝心聚力，幫助香港更好融入和服務國家發展大局，以自身所長、服務國家所需要，同時亦讓香港自身取得更好的長遠發展。這是管治團隊必須做好的「答卷」。

行政長官最近指出，特區政府將會推出新機制全面對接國家「十五五」規劃，更將首次制定香港自身的「五年規劃」，由他親自率領跨局、跨部門、全政府的專班統籌推進。這一舉措是香港強化治理水平、更主動、更系統服務國家發展戰略擔當作為的體現。

我們剛才就着香港如何發揮好自己的角色，對接「十五五」規劃，有積極和具有深度的討論。大家都同意，香港在不同範疇，包括金融、貿易、創科等都具有突出優勢。可以說，結合着當前的國際地緣政治格局和國家發展方向，香港是大有可為的。

例如，在創科方面，國家正加快推動高水平科技自立自強，香港也可以作出獨特的貢獻，包括匯聚全球頂尖的研發團隊和人才、匯聚前沿的創科企業，並利用全鏈條的資金供應——包括耐心資本——來支持科技的發展，以及科技發展與產業發展的深度融合，為香港創造更多優質的就業機會。

又例如在貿易方面，在內地企業紛紛出海，深度參與國際產業鏈和供應鏈的深度合作的時候，香港可利用好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，加快構建高增值供應鏈服務中心，並且與內地企業拼船出海，與全球南方加強合作，開拓更多新市場，也是我們今日積極探討的議題。

總的來説，今日的前廳交流會是一個讓我們聽取很多意見的好機會，也是在貫徹「行政主導」與「愛國者治港」原則相適應的方針下，推動行政立法良性互動的實踐，共同為建設更美好的香港而不懈奮鬥。

請振英代主席。

記者：司長，你好。我想問因為特首指首次會制定香港的「五年規劃」，但新一份預算案在國家「十五五」規劃綱要出台之前就會公布，預算案的政策措施在時間對接上會否有些困難和挑戰？這是第一個問題。第二個問題是就着巴拿馬運河裁決方面，在現時的地緣政治格局下，特區政府如何幫助或保障「走出去」的香港企業，特別在拉美地區的投資安全？這次事件會否影響或如何影響香港和巴拿馬的雙邊貿易？

財政司司長：就國家的「十五五」規劃，雖然規劃正式出台會是三月份的兩會期間，但其建議在十月份時已出台，所以在編制預算案（《財政預算案》）時，我們充分參考「十五五」規劃建議裏的內容。同時，「十五五」規劃是中長期的規劃，對接的工作亦會是比較中長期。在預算案裏，我們就着目前掌握和所知的資料，做好前期部署。

就着巴拿馬的裁決，特區政府已發出新聞稿，扼要來說，我們堅決維護本港企業在世界各地做生意時的法律權益。謝謝。

記者：司長，想問關於巴士安全帶事件，TLB（運輸及物流局）是你屬下，政府有沒有啓動甚麼機制跟進這宗事件？有沒有向司長（局長）了解過？司長（局長）有沒有向你匯報過有關情況？多謝。

財政司司長：安全帶這事件，大家知道特區政府內部很認真對待，我們很快提交法例，廢除相關要求，並繼續做好工作。

記者：有沒有官員需要負責？

財政司司長：我們會繼續做好我們的工作。

Remarks by FS at media session after attending Legislative Council Ante Chamber Exchange Session (with photos/video),2026-02-04 15:40,2026-02-04 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400578.htm,"  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, met the media this morning (February 4) with Principal Officials, the President's Deputy of the Legislative Council, Mr Chan Chun-ying, and Chairmen of Legislative Council Panels, after attending the Legislative Council Ante Chamber Exchange Session. Following are the remarks by Mr Paul Chan:

Reporter: What did you make of the earlier exchange sessions with the lawmakers? And as the Chief Executive said yesterday, Hong Kong will make its first Five-Year Plan following the 15th Five-Year Plan in Beijing, what are the intended directions on how to align with the nation's development goals? How will Hong Kong implement the relevant policies and will your Budget that comes out later this month seek to roll out policies that also align with the nation's directions?

Financial Secretary: The discussion just now in the Ante Chamber focused on the 15th Five-Year Plan of the country. The recommendations for the 15th Five-Year Plan were set out last October. The final Plan will be released in March during the Two Sessions in Beijing. On the basis of those recommendations, in preparing the Budget, we have been taking into full consideration the future role of Hong Kong in aligning with, and making contributions to, the overall national development. During that process, Hong Kong will also benefit. For example, going forward - apart from being an international financial centre and international trade centre, technology and innovation will be a major driver of future economic growth.

  And the 15th Five-Year Plan puts emphasis on technological self-reliance, as well as deeply integrates technology with industrial development. These are also of high reference value for Hong Kong as we work to diversify our economic structure and create more quality jobs for our people. At the same time, it is also necessary to use technology to upgrade and empower different sectors. It is the policy of the Government to embrace technologies and apply them, in particular AI, across different sectors. In the upcoming Budget, content will certainly be devoted to this to outline the future economic direction of Hong Kong.

  For the five-year planning for Hong Kong to be led by the Chief Executive, it is indeed a great move. Going forward, the development of Hong Kong will count on the strong support of the Central Authorities, and the competitive advantages of Hong Kong as an international financial, trade and technology centre. We have a very big hinterland, which is a 1.4 billion-people market, as well as a vibrant technology and industry chain. We need to leverage these advantages to support our future growth. In the Budget, we'll also cover this aspect. Thank you.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"
「大埔宏福苑援助基金」推出兩項援助,2026-02-04 15:30,2026-02-04 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400535.htm,"政府今日（二月四日）宣布在「大埔宏福苑援助基金」下推出兩項特別援助。

Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po rolls out two support measures,2026-02-04 15:30,2026-02-04 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400547.htm,"  The Government announced today (February 4) that two special measures have been rolled out by the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po.

  Earlier, the Beijing Han Hong Love Charity Foundation proposed to make a donation to the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po for designated uses. After discussion with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and endorsement by the Steering Committee on the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the donation will be used to introduce two new measures to render assistance to residents affected by the fire.

  The first measure is to provide a token of solidarity of $100,000 to the families of the 168 deceased from the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, including residents, foreign domestic helpers, visitors, and persons working at Wang Fuk Court during the fire, to help them get through this difficult time and rebuild their confidence in life.

  The second measure is to provide a one-off Chinese New Year goodwill token of $5,000 to each flat owner or their families of all the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po to extend holiday blessings to them.

  The estimated expenditure of the above two measures is around $26.6 million and will be fully borne by the donation from the Foundation. The payments will be disbursed through the ""one social worker per household"" mechanism from today (February 4)."
立法會：創新科技及工業局局長就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-04 15:22,2026-02-04 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400556.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（二月四日）在立法會會議就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案的開場發言：

主席：

感謝陳勇議員就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」提出動議辯論，以及黃浩明議員、李廣宇議員、魏明德議員、譚鎮國議員、范駿華議員、梁美芬議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案。

國家在「十四五」規劃和「十五五」規劃建議均明確支持香港建設國際創新科技中心。國家「十五五」規劃建議更提出，要加快高水平科技自立自強，建設現代化產業體系，促進新質生產力發展。特區政府會全力配合國家科技創新發展策略，積極對接「十五五」規劃發展藍圖，聚力培育新質生產力，構建以科技創新為主體的新實體經濟，更好融入和服務國家發展大局，助力國家實現高質量發展和高水平科技自立自強。

發展北部都會區（北都）與河套深港科技創新合作區（合作區）是特區政府積極對接「十五五」規劃的重要舉措。特區政府將致力在北都發展「國際創科新城」，打造「南金融、北創科」的新發展格局，進一步推動香港與其他大灣區城市創科產業協同發展。河套香港園區與新田科技城提供的新創科用地可為策略性科技企業，提供一個優質創科用地的選項，建立相關產業的研發及設計中心、中試轉化基地及量產設施，形成蓬勃的創科產業鏈，為加快發展新質生產力、實現香港新型工業化提供有力支撐。

合作區位處於深圳河兩側，是北部都會區與廣深科技創新走廊的交匯處，也是國家「十四五」規劃下大灣區四個重大合作平台之一。合作區是國家實現地理上橫跨兩種社會制度、經濟和司法體制，並以科技創新為主題的重大合作區。特區政府一直與深圳市政府全力合作發展該區域 ，以實踐「一國兩制」下「一河兩岸」、「一區兩園」的共同構建理念，發揮港深強強聯手的優勢。

特區政府於二○二四年十一月發布《河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區發展綱要》，闡明香港園區的重點發展方向和策略。河套香港園區已在去年十二月正式開園，聯同科學園和數碼港，香港三大創新科技園的「南、中、北」布局計劃已基本實現。

港深兩地會爭取在河套試行專屬的跨境政策措施，讓人員、物資、資金、數據等四流在區內便捷流動，致力成為國際先進科技創新規劃試驗區，開闢制度與政策創新的試驗田，以響應在「十五五」規劃建議中對高質量發展和科技自立自強的目標要求。

作為河套地區的天然延伸，新田一帶新創科用地可與大灣區內地城市完整的產業供應鏈相結合。創新科技及工業局已於去年十一月公布《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》，為新田科技城訂下清晰的發展方略。我們將全力推動有關發展，按土地的供應時間表，適時提出階段性發展方案，比如成立專屬公司邀請私人發展共同參與開發。

另外，特區政府於去年第四季已就沙嶺約10公頃數據園區發展用地作市場招標，以提供先進算力設施，推動數據及人工智能相關產業發展。政府正按照既定機制處理收到的標書，會盡快公布有關詳情。

產業發展方面，特區政府積極推動香港新型工業化，協助本港製造業利用創新科技升級轉型，並扶植具潛力或代表性的創科企業來港發展、落戶或擴展業務，以期建立、鞏固並完善相關創科產業鏈。在加速下游新型工業化發展方面，我們強化「場景招商」，並已於去年十一月下調「新型工業加速計劃」申請門檻；以及推出「製造及生產線『升』級支援計劃」，向在港營運的企業提供升級轉型生產線方面之資助。我們也將於二○二六至二七年度啓動「創科產業引導基金」，以及積極落實與國家工業和信息化部簽署的《關於發展新質生產力推進新型工業化的合作協議》。政府已於去年十二月就香港新型工業中長期發展展開研究，探討如何主動對接國家「十五五」規劃建議，融入國家新型工業化整體布局。

主席，我會細心聆聽各位議員的意見，並會於總結發言時再作回應。現在請發展局副局長就建設北部的其他措施作補充。"
立法會︰發展局副局長就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-04 15:14,2026-02-04 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400548.htm,"以下是發展局副局長林智文今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上就「進一步提速提效建設好北部都會區，推動香港創科產業更好落地發展」議員議案的開場發言全文：

主席：

北部都會區（北都）是香港經濟發展的新引擎，與大灣區城市協作的新平台，並助力香港融入及貢獻國家發展大局。北都規劃以產業帶動為主軸，在3 000多公頃新發展土地當中，會提供約700公頃新產業及經濟用地，當中包括位於新田科技城約300公頃用作創科的用地，此外亦會提供約100公頃用地作北都大學城發展。

政府已在各方面提速提效發展北都，在決策層面，行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中提出由他領導的「北都發展委員會」，並在下設三個分別由司長或副司長領導、聚焦不同領域的工作組。

在法例方面，發展局會於今年首季展開北都提速專屬法例諮詢，目的是制訂簡化的法定程序，加快發展建設落成及促進產業進駐，如得到議會支持，計劃今年內可以通過專屬法例。

我們亦會以創新思維提出及採用多元開發模式，透過結合有為政府及高效市場，加快北都發展。除了以傳統公開招標模式批出土地外，政府會按相關產業政策靈活批撥土地，包括有限制招標讓符合條件的企業參與競投；也可採用「雙信封」招標制度，考慮標價以外的因素；甚或在合適情況下直接批出用地予對產業經濟發展有顯著裨益的企業。除此以外，發展局計劃在洪水橋／厦村市中心的商業用地試行分階段開發模式，容許在新發展區發展初期先建設和營運低密度的設施，藉此吸引企業進駐，發揮拉動作用。

另外，為了讓企業將來能盡快落戶，發展局近日已推出加快北都私人項目審批的行政改革措施，包括為關鍵審批流程設時限和高層介入機制，以加快審批，相信對於企業參與、發展及建設北都會大有幫助。

接下來，我會細心聆聽各位議員的寶貴意見，共同交流如何更快、更有效推進北都發展及創科產業落戶。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
二○二六年農曆年宵市場二月十一日起舉行,2026-02-04 15:00,2026-02-04 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020300474.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（二月四日）公布，二○二六年農曆年宵市場於二月十一日（年廿四）至十七日（年初一）清晨七時，一連七天在十四個地點舉行，共設約一千五百個濕貨、乾貨和快餐攤位，方便市民購買賀年植物和花卉、賀年食品、裝飾和揮春等，迎接新歲。

食環署發言人說：「各農曆年宵市場會應用科技措施監察場內情況，並在有需要時實施人流管制。十四個年宵市場的人流情況會以紅、黃、綠燈形式在食環署網頁顯示，方便市民知悉現場的擠迫程度。綠色代表人流較少；黃色代表場內略為擠迫；紅色代表場內非常擠迫。」

發言人續說：「食環署會從年宵市場收集由花檔檔主自願送出未能售出的花卉和盆栽，由食環署員工組成的義工隊於年初一（二月十七日）轉贈予安老院、殘疾人士院舍和公立醫院。」

食環署提醒攤位獲許可人只可在其攤位售賣及推廣准售商品，不得使用准用範圍作任何其他活動。倘食環署認爲獲許可人在場地內為宣傳、推廣、陳列、展示、送贈或售賣准售商品而進行的活動是違法、不利於國家安全、不道德，或是不符合年宵市場的宗旨，食環署有權指示獲許可人停止有關活動，而獲許可人必須立即遵從署方指示，否則食環署會終止該獲許可人的特許協議及收回有關攤位。

此外，特許協議亦列明乾貨攤位的高度不得距離地面超過三米，濕貨攤位和快餐攤位則不可距離地面超過四米半。濕貨攤位和快餐攤位的高度如距離地面超過三米，獲許可人須自費聘用一名認可人士、註冊結構工程師或《建築地盤（安全）規例》（第59I章）規定的合資格人士，在活動舉行前為其攤位的搭建物向食環署提供安全證明的正本，並在該攤位的搭建物上張貼一份上述安全證明的副本。另外，活動式帳篷（如使用）的每個邊角及錨固點均須以適當配重物（如沙袋或活動式帳篷專用注水底座）牢固固定。當強烈季候風信號即將發出或生效時，獲許可人須立即檢查攤位，並按需要採取加固措施。

另外，食環署提醒攤位獲許可人不得在年宵市場售賣飄浮的LED發光氣球及觀賞魚。如要展示或出售氣球及充氣物品，只可使用空氣或氦氣作為充氣氣體，而在存放氦氣瓶方面亦有規定。根據特許協議，獲許可人不得在准用範圍內存放、貯存或使用容水量超過一百五十公升的壓縮氦氣，即《2012年危險品（適用及豁免）規例》（第295E章）所訂明無須領取牌照的份量上限。為安全起見，食環署將禁止市民攜帶飄浮的LED發光氣球進入年宵市場範圍。

發言人並提醒市民在歡度節日時須保持環境清潔，切勿亂拋垃圾。檔戶亦應妥善棄置廢物，保持其攤位及附近地方整潔衞生。

有關二○二六年農曆年宵市場的地點和開放時間等資料，可參閱食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk）或致電食環署熱線2868 0000查詢。"
2026 Lunar New Year fairs to start from February 11,2026-02-04 15:00,2026-02-04 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020300475.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) announced today (February 4) that the 2026 Lunar New Year (LNY) fairs will be held at 14 locations for seven days from February 11 (Wednesday) to 7am on February 17. About 1 500 wet goods, dry goods and fast food stalls will be set up to enable the public to buy festive plants and flowers, LNY food, decorations and spring couplets (fai chun) to welcome the LNY.

  A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""The venues of the LNY fairs will be monitored using innovative and technological measures, and crowd control will be implemented as necessary. The footfall of the 14 LNY fairs will be displayed in a 'green, amber and red lights' format on the FEHD website to enable the public to know the crowd conditions at the fairs. A green light means few people are inside the fair, the amber light indicates the fair venue is slightly crowded, while the red light shows that the fair venue is very crowded.""

  The spokesman added, ""The FEHD will gather unsold pots of flowers and plants donated by vendors in the fairs, which will then be delivered to homes with elderly people, residential care homes for persons with disabilities and public hospitals by volunteer teams made up of FEHD staff on LNY Day (February 17).

  The FEHD reminded licensees that the stalls are solely for the purpose of selling and promoting the sale of permitted commodities, with no other activities allowed in the licensed area. If the FEHD considers that any activity conducted by the licensee to publicise, promote, display, show, offer or sell any permitted commodities in the venue is unlawful, contrary to the interest of national security, or being immoral or incompatible with the object of the LNY fair, the FEHD is entitled to direct the licensee to stop conducting such activity and the licensee must immediately comply with such direction, or the FEHD will terminate the licence agreement and reclaim the stall.

  In addition, as stated in the licence agreement, the height of dry goods stalls must not exceed 3 metres, while the height of wet goods stalls and fast food stalls must not exceed 4.5m from ground level. For wet goods stalls and fast food stalls with a height of more than 3m from ground level, the licensee must, at his own expense, provide the FEHD with an original certificate issued by an authorised person, a registered structural engineer, or a competent person under the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations (Cap. 59I) to certify the structural safety of the stall structure before the LNY fairs are opened to the public. The licensee must also affix a copy of the aforesaid certificate on the structure of the stall. Also, each corner and anchor point of the marquee (if any) shall be securely fastened using appropriate ballast weights such as sandbags or purpose-designed marquee water weights. During the period when the Strong Monsoon Signal is in force or is to be issued, the licensee shall immediately inspect the stall and adopt reinforcement measures as necessary.

  Furthermore, the FEHD reminded licensees that no floating LED glowing balloons and aquarium fish should be sold in the LNY fairs. If balloons or gas-filled articles are to be displayed or offered for sale, only air or helium is allowed to be used for inflating the products. There are also stipulations on the storage of helium cylinders at the fair venues. According to the licence agreement, licensees must not keep, store or use more than 150 litres (water capacity) of compressed helium, i.e. the respective general exempt quantity for which a licence is not required, pursuant to the Dangerous Goods (Application and Exemption) Regulation 2012 (Cap. 295E) in the licensed area. For the sake of safety, no floating LED glowing balloons will be allowed to be brought into the LNY fair venues.

  The spokesman also urged members of the public to keep the environment clean and not to litter while enjoying the festive season. Stall operators should also properly dispose of waste and keep their stalls and the surroundings clean and tidy.

  For information on the 2026 LNY fairs including the locations and opening hours, please visit the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk) or call the FEHD hotline at 2868 0000."
LCQ14: Regulation of owners' corporations,2026-02-04 15:00,2026-02-04 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400358.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Webster Ng and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

There are views pointing out that in many newly completed private housing estates or those completed for around 10 years, the gradual accumulation of the sinking fund and financial surpluses following the formation of owners' corporations (OCs) may give rise to risks of OC governance and elections being infiltrated or even ""hijacked"" by appointed or authorised non-owner representatives, and this could potentially lead to a chain of problems such as bid-rigging, improper procurement of works, and jeopardy of owners' interests. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that many office-bearers of OCs are owners serving on a voluntary or part-time basis, and they may not be familiar with regulations and procedures, of the training, professional support and risk alert measures currently provided by the Government to newly formed OCs through the District Building Management Liaison Team of the Home Affairs Department or other channels; whether the Government will consider requiring OCs, when handling major procurement contracts and works involving a hefty sum, as well as conducting change-of-term elections, to engage independent professionals (e.g. independent returning officers/legal advisers/procurement advisers) to perform gatekeeping, so as to enhance the credibility of the relevant procedures;

(2) whether the Government has, over the past five years, received the following complaints, requests for assistance or enquiries involving OC operation: (i) disputes involving change-of-term elections of OCs or decisions concerning large-scale works, where owners have requested the convening of an extraordinary general meeting of OCs in accordance with the requirement of receiving the request from not less than 5 per cent of the owners (i.e. as stipulated in paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 to the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344)); and (ii) disputes involving the authenticity of documents (including list of signatories or authorisation documents) submitted for the purpose of convening an extraordinary general meeting of OCs; if so, of the number of such cases, as well as the respective approaches adopted by the Government and the outcomes;

(3) regarding the aforesaid threshold requirement for convening an extraordinary general meeting of the OC at the request of not less than 5 per cent of the owners, whether the Government has evaluated if such threshold is suitable for application to buildings and properties of various scales, including but not limited to:

(i) single-block buildings or small housing estates (i.e. with a smaller number of owners), and whether the 5 per cent threshold may mean that an extremely small number of owners will be able to frequently initiate an extraordinary general meeting of the OC; and

(ii) large housing estates (i.e. with numerous owners), and whether the 5 per cent threshold will make it difficult for owners to initiate an extraordinary general meeting of the OC to handle urgent matters;

if the Government has evaluated, of the evaluation method, key findings and conclusions; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will conduct the relevant evaluation; and

(4) given that during the debate on ""Motion on support and rebuilding work after the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po"" in this Council on January 14 this year, the Government indicated that, in order to enhance the protection of owners' rights and interests, it has formulated the directions for amending Cap. 344, including raising the voting thresholds for OCs to undertake large-scale maintenance works and high-value procurements, as well as improving the system for handling proxy instruments, of the specific timetable for the relevant work?

Reply:

President,

The Government is committed to assist owners in discharging their responsibilities on building management. We have in place a series of measures, including providing an effective legal framework (i.e. the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) (BMO)) to enable owners to form Owners' Corporations (OCs), and offering support services to assist OCs and owners in handling building management matters.

To keep pace with the developments in the society and the evolving building management needs, the Government amended the BMO in 2024, and the Building Management (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 (the Amendment Ordinance) has taken effect since July 2025. When the Amendment Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Council (LegCo), the Government indicated that it would continue to follow up on various building management issues. Subsequently, the Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the Government would commence the next-phase review of the BMO, with a view to formulating proposals for further refining the Ordinance. In response to public concerns regarding building management, the Government will deepen institutional reforms and forge ahead the next-phase review and further amendments to the BMO. Five major amendment directions have been preliminarily proposed, including increasing the voting thresholds for decisions on large-scale maintenance works and high-value procurements, improving the mechanisms for proxy instruments and declaration of interests, clarifying meeting procedures, and strengthening the powers of the Authority.

Our reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Webster Ng is as follows:

(1) To support the OCs (including newly formed OCs), District Building Management Liaison Teams under District Offices (DOs) have been providing Pre-Meeting Advisory Service for Owners' Corporations. The service is offered to newly formed OCs, newly elected Management Committees (MCs) of OCs, as well as those OCs anticipating the discussion of controversial issues at their owners' meetings. Prior to the owners' meetings, the MC members will be briefed on meeting procedures and provided with relevant information. The Home Affairs Department (HAD) also collaborates with tertiary institutions to deliver the LEAD Programme for MC members, which provides structured training courses with knowledge on building management. We also provide the Advanced LEAD Programme, in which experienced lawyers are engaged to explore common building management scenarios (such as water seepage, unauthorised structures, apportionment of management fee and litigation) along with the relevant legal provisions and case rulings. It aims to enhance the effectiveness of MC members in handling building management matters.

The Government recognises that building management can involve complex issues. Therefore, to address the various situations encountered by OCs in their day-to-day operations, the HAD continues to provide a range of support services, covering areas such as building management advisory service, legal advice and mediation, with the objective to offer professional support to OCs and owners in handling building management matters. These services include:


Owners'Corporations Advisory Services Scheme: Property management companies are engaged by the HAD to provide OCs with free advisory services, assisting them in complying with statutory orders, handling third-party risks insurance and other building management matters;




Free Legal Advice Service on Building Management: In collaboration with the Law Society of Hong Kong, the service provides legal advice on matters such as the interpretation of the Deed of Mutual Covenant or provisions of the BMO, as well as the responsibilities for maintaining common areas of buildings; and




Free Mediation Service Scheme for Building Management, Building Management Dispute Resolution Service (BMDRS) or Panel of Advisors on Building Management Disputes: With the assistance of professionals from various fields (including retired judges / judicial officers, lawyers, accountants, surveyors and engineers, and mediators), these services assist in resolving disputes concerning the operation of OCs, financial arrangements and repair works.


The HAD will continue to assist OCs and owners in applying for and making use of the relevant services to obtain appropriate and effective support.

On the other hand, among the five major proposed amendment directions mentioned above, on large-scale maintenance works and high-value procurement, we recommend introducing a tiered system for quorum and voting-in-person thresholds. This aims to encourage more owners to personally participate in major decisions, reduce potential disputes and strength the protection of owners' rights. We will further refine the declaration of interest mechanism by requiring the work consultants to declare any relationships with contractors, thereby enhancing the transparency in the procurement process. In addition, we also recommend imposing a ceiling on the number of proxy instruments an individual can hold, and displaying a list of units which have signed proxy instruments in buildings. This will enhance the transparency of proxy instrument system and prevent meeting outcomes from being manipulated by a minority. As for whether OCs should be required to engage independent professionals, we will consider the feasibility of this recommendation, including the financial implications on owners.

(2) Over the past five years, the HAD has received approximately 1 630 complaints related to building management. The HAD does not have separate statistics categorised by the nature of the complaints.

If a DO becomes aware of a dispute within an OC regarding a request from no less than 5 per cent of the owners to convene an OC meeting, it will contact the Chairman of the MC to ascertain the circumstances. Should it be determined that the Chairman has failed to act in compliance with the requirements of the BMO, the DO will issue letters to the Chairman, requesting compliance with the statutory requirements. If a mutual agreement cannot be reached between the OC and the owners, the DO will urge the disputing parties to strengthen communication, including recommending relevant stakeholders to consider using mediation services, with the aim of assisting the parties involved resolve the dispute and allowing building management work to return to normal. As for cases involving suspected forgery of documents, we will urge the OC or owners to report the matter to the relevant law enforcement authorities (i.e. the Police).

(3) On one hand, the BMO grants the MC of an OC the authority and responsibility to handle and execute building management duties on behalf of the owners. On the other hand, it also empowers owners to oversee the operations of the OC and its MC. Regarding the BMO provision that allows no less than 5 per cent of the owners to request the MC Chairman to convene an OC meeting, the original intent behind setting this threshold is to safeguard owners' right to participation. It provides owners with a legitimate channel to raise matters of concern and require the Chairman to convene an OC meeting for discussion. This threshold also takes into account the BMO requirement that OC meetings must have a quorum of 10 per cent of owners in attendance, thereby ensuring that discussed items reflect a certain level of concern and consensus and allowing meetings to proceed effectively.

We take note of Member's views and will consider them as part of the review of the BMO.

(4) Compared to the amendment exercise in 2024, the current review involves broader and more complex issues. The Government will first present the various proposed amendment directions to the LegCo to initiate subsequent discussions. We will also seek views from different stakeholders, such as OCs, owners, the property management industry, and various political groups. Furthermore, district opinions will be gathered through the Working Groups on Building Management established under District Councils, with the aim of finalising the concrete legislative proposals as soon as possible for submission to the LegCo for deliberation."
LCQ8: Loan provided by the Government to the CUHK Medical Centre,2026-02-04 15:00,2026-02-04 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400260.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chong Ho-fung and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

  In 2015, the Government provided CUHK Medical Centre Limited with a loan of $4,033 million for the development of the CUHK Medical Centre (CUHKMC). Following approval from the Finance Committee of this Council, the first repayment date of the loan was extended to 2028. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of CUHKMC told the media in recent months that CUHKMC achieved its first monthly breakeven in November last year, whether the Government knows the actual figures of CUHKMC's revenue, operating costs, as well as profit/loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for November and December last year, and how such figures compare with those for the same period in 2024;

(2) as according to the paper submitted by the Government to the Finance Committee of this Council on February 28 last year, CUHKMC's actual EBITDA figure for the first half of the 2024-2025 financial year was a loss of $77 million, while the projected figure for the whole year was a loss of $54 million (implying that there would be a profit of about $23 million in EBITDA for the second half of the financial year), whether the Government knows if there is any discrepancy between the actual EBITDA figure and the projected figure for that financial year; if so, of the reasons in details; and

(3) as the CEO of CUHKMC has previously indicated that it would be quite difficult for CUHKMC to commence repayment in 2028 as scheduled, whether the Government has formulated contingency plans in this regard?

Reply:

President,

  The consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Chong Ho-fung is as follows:

  The CUHK Medical Centre (CUHKMC) is a non-profit-making private teaching hospital wholly owned by the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), with land and loan granted by the Government to the CUHKMC. The CUHK and the CUHKMC bear the responsibility to ensure the hospital's proper governance and operation, as well as delivery of relevant obligations, in accordance with the Service Deed and the Loan Agreement entered into with the Government. In line with its not-for-profit nature, all surpluses of the CUHKMC will be ploughed back into the hospital for its own development and the Faculty of Medicine of the CUHK for research and teaching. The CUHKMC performs a unique role in promoting research and development of the latest medical technologies in local medical schools and providing opportunities for their clinical applications.

  Based on the latest information provided by the CUHKMC, for the full 2024-25 financial year (i.e. from July 2024 to June 2025), the CUHKMC recorded a loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of about $185 million, which differed from the previous projection. This was mainly due to the lower-than-projected actual business activity and revenue levels during the period. In addition to competition in the healthcare services market, the business operation and service expansion were also impacted by intensifying competition for the recruitment and retention of personnel in the healthcare sector.

  As regards the overall financial position of the CUHKMC for the 2025-26 financial year, the Health Bureau has earlier required the CUHK and the CUHKMC to regularly report its financial status as well as review and update the future financial projection(s). The Health Bureau, jointly with the CUHK and the CUHKMC, will make an overall report to the Panel on Health Services of the Legislative Council later this year, and it is not appropriate at this stage to comment on the performance of the CUHKMC for individual months. The Health Bureau has noted that there was a change in the management of the CUHKMC last year. Since then, the CUHKMC has progressively introduced a series of measures to improve its financial situation and control its costs. They include reviewing and adjusting the hospital's service charges and gradually increasing its service volume, such as putting additional operating theatres and hospital beds into service in phases. The CUHKMC has also strengthened control over operating costs (including professional fees and direct costs) to mitigate the overall financial impact.

  In the light of recent media reports, the CUHKMC has reiterated to the Government that it will continue efforts to improve its financial and operational performance. The Health Bureau will continue to closely monitor the operation and financial position of the CUHKMC, maintain close communication with the CUHK on matters relating to the governance and management of the hospital, and continue the dialogue with the CUHK regarding the future operation or financial situation of the hospital as well as any proposed financing options. The Health Bureau has not received any further request for delayed repayment from the CUHKMC thus far. The Government will not rule out any possible solutions should structural problems emerge in the operation and finances of the CUHKMC."

Question:

  Last year, the Finance Committee of this Council approved to further extend the repayment of the Government loan of $4,033 million by the CUHK Medical Centre (CUHKMC) for three years. However, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of CUHKMC has told the media in recent months that it will be difficult to commence repayment of the loan to the Government as scheduled in 2028. Regarding the operational status and financial situation of CUHKMC, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the latest operational status of CUHKMC (including the inpatient bed occupancy rate and the average number of inpatient bed days, as well as the utilisation rates of different services, such as outpatient services);

(2) given that, while the CEO of CUHKMC has previously indicated that CUHKMC has to achieve an annual total revenue of $6 billion before it can repay the Government loan as scheduled in 2028, the total revenue of CUHKMC last year was only $2.38 billion, whether the Government knows the latest financial situation of CUHKMC (including profit/loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and of CUHKMC's operational plans and proposals in place to achieve the targets of financial sustainability and repayment of loan as scheduled; and

(3) as the CEO of CUHKMC has pointed out that the original projection of an annual total revenue of $7 billion in three to five years after the commissioning of CUHKMC as made by the independent financial advisor was ""too optimistic"" and ""highly exaggerated"", whether the Government knows if CUHKMC has updated its financial projections based on the latest operational status; if so, of the details of the latest projections; if not, the reasons for that?

主席：

就莊豪鋒議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

香港中文大學醫院（中大醫院）是香港中文大學（中大）全資擁有的非牟利私家教學醫院，政府向中大醫院提供土地及貸款。中大校方和院方有責任根據與政府訂立的服務契約和貸款協議，確保醫院妥善管治及營運並履行相關責任。因應其非牟利性質，中大醫院所得全數盈餘均會用作投資自身醫院發展，以及資助中大醫學院進行研究和教學，對促進本地醫學院研發最新醫療技術，並提供臨床應用機會，發揮獨特角色。

根據中大醫院提供的最新資料，就二○二四／二五財政年度全年（即二○二四年七月至二○二五年六月），中大醫院錄得未計利息、稅項、折舊及攤銷前虧損約1億8,500萬元，與先前預測的數字有所差異，主要由於期內實際業務活動及收入水平低於早前預測。除了醫療服務市場競爭外，業務營運與服務擴展亦受到醫療行業在人手招聘與留任方面競爭日益激烈的影響。

至於中大醫院二○二五／二六財政年度整體財務狀況，醫務衞生局早前已要求中大校方和院方定期匯報財務狀況，檢視和更新未來的財務推算，並會聯同中大校方和院方於今年稍後向立法會衞生事務委員會作整體匯報，現階段不宜評論醫院個別月份的表現。醫務衞生局理解中大醫院在去年管理層出現更替，而中大醫院其後陸續推行一系列措施以改善其財務狀況及控制成本，包括檢視和調整其服務收費，以及逐步增加服務量，例如分階段啓用額外手術室和病床，並就營運成本（例如專業費用和直接成本）加強控制，以紓緩整體財務影響。
 
中大醫院因應近期傳媒報道，已向政府重申會持續推動改善其財務及經營表現的工作。醫務衞生局會繼續密切監察中大醫院的營運和財務狀況，就醫院的管治和管理事宜與中大校方緊密聯繫，並與中大校方就中大醫院未來的營運或財務狀況及任何融資方案保持溝通。醫務衞生局至今未有收到中大醫院任何再延遲還款要求。若中大醫院營運及財政出現結構性問題，政府不會排除任何可能的解決方案。"

立法會十四題：業主立案法團的監管,2026-02-04 15:00,2026-02-04 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400357.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上吳錦華議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，不少新落成或落成約十年的私人屋苑在成立業主立案法團（法團）後，隨着維修儲備金及財政盈餘逐步累積，可能出現法團管治及選舉被獲委任或授權的非業主代表滲透甚至「騎劫」的風險，並有機會衍生圍標、工程採購不當及業主利益受損等連鎖問題。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於不少法團幹事屬業主義務或兼職性質，對法規及程序未必熟悉，政府現時透過民政事務總署地區大廈管理聯絡小組或其他渠道，向新成立法團提供的培訓、專業支援及風險提示措施為何；政府會否考慮要求法團在處理重大採購合約及較大額工程，以及進行換屆選舉時，引入獨立的專業人士（例如獨立監票人／法律顧問／採購顧問）把關，以提升有關程序的公信力；

（二）過去五年，政府有否接獲以下涉及法團運作的投訴、求助或查詢：（i）涉及法團換屆選舉或大型工程決策的爭議，並有業主按不少於5%業主的規定（即按《建築物管理條例》（第344章）附表3第1段的規定）要求召開法團特別業主大會；及（ii）涉及為召開法團特別業主大會而提交的文件（包括簽署名單或授權文件）真偽的爭議；如有，有關的個案宗數，以及政府的跟進方式及結果分別為何；

（三）就上述須有不少於5%業主要求方可召開法團特別業主大會的門檻設計，政府有否評估該門檻是否適合應用於不同規模的樓宇及物業，包括但不限於：

（i）單幢大廈或小型屋苑（即業主人數較少）下，5%是否相當於極少數人即可頻密啓動法團特別業主大會；及

（ii）大型屋苑（即業主人數眾多）下，5%會否造成業主難以啓動法團特別業主大會以處理緊急事項；

如有，評估方法、主要結果及結論為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否展開有關評估；及

（四）鑑於政府在本年一月十四日本會辯論「有關大埔宏福苑火災後支援及重建工作的議案」時表示，為加強保障業主權益，已就修訂第344章擬定方向，包括提高法團進行大型維修工程及大額採購的投票門檻，以及完善委任代表文書處理制度等，有關工作的具體時間表為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直致力協助業主履行管理大廈的責任。我們提供多項措施，包括制定有效的法律框架（即《建築物管理條例》（第344章）（《建管條例》））讓業主成立業主立案法團（法團），及向法團和業主提供支援服務，協助法團和業主處理大廈管理的事宜。

為配合社會發展及大廈管理需求的變化，政府於二○二四年完成《建管條例》的修訂，而《2024年建築物管理（修訂）條例》（《修訂條例》）已於二○二五年七月正式生效。政府在立法會通過《修訂條例》時已表示，會繼續跟進大廈管理的不同議題。其後，行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》提出，政府將開展下一階段有關《建管條例》的檢視工作，以期制訂進一步優化條例的建議方案。為回應社會對大廈管理的關注，政府會深化制度改革，推進下一階段《建管條例》的檢視和修訂工作，初步擬定五大修訂方向包括提高大型維修工程及大額採購決定的投票門檻、完善委任代表文書及利益申報制度、清晰會議程序，以及加強主管當局權力等。

就吳錦華議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下︰

（一）為支援法團（包括新成立的法團），各區民政事務處（民政處）的地區大廈管理聯絡小組一直為新成立的法團，以及新一屆法團管理委員會（管委會）和預期將在法團業主大會上討論具爭議性議題的法團，提供「法團會前諮詢服務」，在法團會議前向管委會委員講解會議程序及提供相關資料。民政事務總署（民政總署）亦與專上學院合作，為法團管委會成員提供「菁英領導研習班」，透過系統性的培訓課程教授大廈管理方面的知識。我們亦有提供「菁英領導進階班」，透過聘請資深律師，探討大廈管理的常見情況（例如滲水、僭建物、管理費攤分及訴訟等事宜）及相關法例的規定及案例的裁決，提升管委會成員處理有關事宜的效能。

政府明白大廈管理屬複雜的議題。因此，針對法團日常運作時遇到的不同情況，民政總署一直提供不同支援服務，涵蓋大廈管理諮詢、法律諮詢，以及調解等範疇，務求為法團和業主提供專業的支援，以處理大廈管理事宜，當中包括：


「法團諮詢服務計劃」：由民政總署委聘的物業管理公司為法團提供免費的諮詢服務，協助遵從法定命令、處理第三者風險保險或其他日常大廈管理的事宜；




「大廈管理免費法律諮詢服務」：與香港律師會合作，就大廈公契或《建管條例》條文的詮釋、維修大廈公用地方的責任等事宜提供意見；及




「大廈管理義務專業調解服務計劃」、「解決大廈管理爭議服務」或「大廈管理糾紛顧問小組」：透過來自不同界別的專業人士（包括退休法官／司法人員、律師、會計師、測量師及工程師、調解員等），協助解決涉及對法團的運作、財務安排或維修工程等爭議。


民政總署會繼續協助法團及業主申請使用相關服務，以取得適切到位的支援。

另一方面，在上述五大建議修訂方向中，就大型維修工程及大額採購方面，我們建議就相關採購引入分級制出席和親自投票門檻，推動更多業主親身參與重大決議，減少潛在爭議及加強保障業主權益，並會進一步完善利益申報制度，建議要求工程顧問就與承辦商之間的關係作申報，讓採購過程更透明。我們亦建議設立限制持有代表文書的上限，以及在大廈張貼已簽署委任代表文書的單位名單，提高委任代表文書制度的透明度，同時防止會議結果被少數人操控的情況。至於是否須要求法團引入獨立專業人士，我們亦會考慮有關建議的可行性，包括對業主的財政負擔。

（二）在過去五年，民政總署合共接獲約1 630宗有關大廈管理的投訴。民政總署並沒有備存按投訴內容分類的統計數字。

如得悉法團就不少於5%的業主要求召開法團會議的事宜出現糾紛，地區民政處會聯絡管委會主席，了解情況。如發現主席未有按《建管條例》的規定行事，便會致函要求主席按規定行事。若法團和業主仍未能取得共識，地區民政處會要求爭議各方加強溝通，包括建議有關持份者考慮接受調解服務，務求讓涉事各方解決爭議，讓大廈管理工作重回正軌。至於如涉及懷疑偽造文書，我們會促請法團或業主向相關執法部門（即警方）報案。

（三）《建管條例》一方面賦予法團管委會代表業主處理和執行大廈管理工作的權力和職責，另一方面亦賦權業主監察法團和管委會的運作。就《建管條例》中容許不少於5%的業主要求管委會主席召開法團會議的規定，設立有關門檻的初衷是保障業主參與權，為業主提供一個合法途徑提出關注事項，並要求管委會主席召開法團會議作討論。此門檻的設定，亦考慮到法團會議須以10%業主出席作為法定人數的規定，藉此確保議題具一定程度的關注與共識，使會議得以有效進行。

我們備悉議員提出的意見，並會在《建管條例》的檢視工作一併進行研究。

（四）與二○二四年進行的修訂工作相比，今次的工作涉及更廣泛、更複雜的議題。政府會先向立法會提交各項修訂方向，以展開後續討論。我們亦會聽取不同持份者的意見，例如法團、業主、物業管理業界及各政團等，並透過在區議會成立的大廈管理工作小組收集地區意見，務求盡快敲定具體立法建議，提交立法會審議。"
​立法會五題：規管電動可移動工具,2026-02-04 14:50,2026-02-04 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400355.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上譚鎮國議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

有市民反映，電動可移動工具在香港廣泛使用，尤其新界居民常以其作短途代步工具。然而，部分使用者在道路操作該等工具時橫衝直撞，加上不時發生電池充電時短路爆炸的意外，令該等工具成為社區安全隱患。關於規管電動可移動工具，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去兩年，涉及非法使用電動可移動工具的被捕人數，以及因使用該等工具而引致的意外宗數及性質為何（例如交通意外及充電短路等）；該等意外的傷亡人數為何；

（二）規管電動可移動工具的立法工作進度及詳情為何，以及該等工具的認證標準將於何時推出及生效；政府在完成相關立法工作前，有何措施減少涉及該等工具的意外；及

（三）據悉內地近日進一步規管電動可移動工具的使用，部分城市禁止攜帶該等工具進入電梯，以免引起火警，政府會否仿效有關做法？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來對推動綠色出行的新科技秉持開放態度，同時非常重視道路安全。我們留意到電動可移動工具在世界各地日趨普及。我們計劃在今年立法並推出規管安排，以容許在指定範圍安全使用電動可移動工具，提供有效的首／尾程短途出行方案，配合新發展區的單車徑發展，成為個人綠色低碳出行的又一選擇。

就譚鎮國議員提問的各部分，經諮詢保安局、發展局、運輸署、警務處、消防處及機電工程署，現回覆如下。

（一）由於電動可移動工具是由機械驅動，符合《道路交通條例》（第374章）中「汽車」的現行定義，因此使用未登記或領牌的電動可移動工具，可能違反相關法例。警務處不時展開行動，針對非法使用電動可移動工具嚴厲執法，確保道路安全。過去兩年，涉及電動可移動工具的交通意外在二○二四年有三宗，二○二五年有八宗；至於涉及使用電動可移動工具的火警事故在二○二四及二○二五年分別有12和17宗，主要成因為電力故障。兩項數字和之前幾年比較大致平穩，而當中没有涉及致命的意外。但同時因非法使用電動可移動工具被警方拘捕的人數有上升的趨勢，由二○二四年的647人上升至二○二五年的760人。數字反映有需要加強規管確保安全使用。

（二）及（三）為確保電動可移動工具的產品質素及安全，運輸署和香港生產力促進局經參考不同地區的做法後，正擬訂一套產品認證機制。作為規管架構的核心，這套認證機制將要求由認可的認證機構，評估各型號電動可移動工具是否符合由運輸署訂定的技術規格及電機要求。獲認證的產品會貼上二維碼認證標籤，方便市民及執法人員辨識。就此，運輸署已徵詢不同持份者，包括製造商、供應商、使用者團體、測試實驗室、專業學會、立法會交通事務委員會、與試驗安排相關的區議會，以及交通諮詢委員會的意見，以期制訂切實可行、保障安全的機制和標準，署方亦正與生產力促進局推行模擬認證安排，邀請業界參與，吸收試行經驗，優化認證規定和安排。

對於問題中提及的消防安全方面，運輸署正與消防處商討具體措施，以消減電動可移動工具所帶來的火警風險。其中，電池安全為上述認證安排的重要一環。鑑於目前鋰離子電池中的液態電解質具易燃性，運輸署在設計認證安排時尤其關注，會要求認證機構根據內地及世界其他主要地方的標準對電池進行認證測試，例如過度充電或放電控制、短路及過熱防禦、振動和機械衝擊測試等，以確保產品安全。我們亦正探討將不易燃的半固態和固態電池納入認證計劃的可能性。運輸署擬議的認證標準將適當地納入各地的最新產品技術要求，包括防火要求，將來亦會適時更新。運輸署也計劃在實務守則中加入如何充電和使用電池的建議。攜帶符合安全標準及經過認證的電動可移動工具進入室內，包括升降機，將不會影響消防安全。

此外，政府計劃在產品認證安排下訂立清晰指引，讓不同的持份者，包括製造商、供應商、認證機構等清楚其責任。使用者方面，電動可移動工具使用者必須年滿16歲，佩戴頭盔及使用合規格的產品。

運輸署一直聯同道路安全議會及警務處透過不同的渠道，例如刊物、網頁及社交媒體等向公眾宣傳有關道路安全和使用電動可移動工具的訊息。我們會繼續透過宣傳及教育工作，加強市民的安全意識。推出規管安排之後，運輸署發出的實務守則亦會加入相關指引，向使用者持續灌輸正確的駕駛態度和安全訊息。

由於議題涉及範圍廣泛，政府會就電動可移動工具的規管安排廣泛諮詢持份者。我們計劃在今年內將最新的立法建議諮詢立法會交通事務委員會。

多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Regulation of electric mobility devices,2026-02-04 14:50,2026-02-04 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400352.htm,"​Following is a question by the Hon Tam Chun-kwok and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

Some members of the public have relayed that electric mobility devices (EMDs) are widely used in Hong Kong, particularly by residents in the New Territories, who often use them for short-distance commuting. However, some users operate such devices recklessly on roads, and incidents of battery short-circuit explosions during charging occur from time to time, rendering such devices a potential safety hazard in the community. Regarding the regulation of EMDs, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of persons arrested in the past two years for involvement in the illegal use of EMDs, as well as the number and nature of accidents (such as traffic accidents and short circuits during charging) arising from the use of such devices; the number of casualties in such accidents;

(2) of the progress and details of the legislative work for regulating EMDs, as well as when the certification standards for such devices will be introduced and come into effect; the measures put in place by the Government to reduce accidents involving such devices before the completion of the relevant legislative work; and

(3) as it is learnt that the Mainland has recently further regulated the use of EMDs, with some cities prohibiting the carrying of such devices into lifts to avoid causing fires, whether the Government will follow such practice?

Reply:

President,

The Government has always adopted an open attitude towards new technologies for promoting green commuting whilst attaching great importance to road safety. We note that electric mobility devices (EMDs) are becoming increasingly popular around the world. We plan to legislate and introduce regulatory arrangements this year to enable the safe use of EMDs within designated areas. This will provide an effective first/last mile short-distance commuting solution, and will offer another green and low-carbon personal travel option, complementing the development of cycle tracks in new development areas.

In consultation with the Security Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Transport Department (TD), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, my reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Tam Chun-kwok is as follows:

(1) As EMDs are mechanically propelled, they fall within the current definition of ""motor vehicles"" under the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374), and the use of unregistered or unlicensed EMDs may contravene the relevant laws. To ensure road safety, the HKPF carries out operations from time to time and takes strict enforcement actions against the illegal use of EMDs. Over the past two years, there were three traffic accidents involving EMDs in 2024 and eight in 2025; and for fire incidents involving EMDs, there were 12 and 17 cases respectively in 2024 and 2025, with electrical faults being the primary cause. Both figures were largely stable compared with the past few years and no fatal accidents were involved. However, there is a rising trend in the number of persons arrested by the HKPF for the illegal use of EMDs, rising from 647 persons in 2024 to 760 persons in 2025. These figures indicate that there is a need to step up the regulation to ensure the safe use of EMDs.

(2) and (3) To ensure the product quality and safety of EMDs, the TD and the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) are devising a product certification mechanism, having regard to practices in various regions. As the core of the regulatory framework, the certification mechanism will require the engagement of certification bodies to evaluate whether various models of EMDs comply with the technical specifications and motor requirements drawn up by the TD. A certification label with a QR code will be affixed to certified products for easy identification by the public and law enforcement officers. The TD has gauged the views of various stakeholders including manufacturers, suppliers, user organisations, testing laboratories, professional institutions, the Legislative Council Panel on Transport, the District Councils related to the trial arrangements, and the Transport Advisory Committee, so as to develop a mechanism and a set of standards that are practicable and safety-oriented. Meanwhile, the TD is working with the HKPC to implement simulated certification arrangements for industry participation, with a view to gaining trial experience and refining the certification requirements and arrangements.

On the fire safety aspect mentioned in the question, the TD is working with the FSD to discuss concrete measures to minimise the fire risks associated with EMDs. In this regard, battery safety is a critical part of the aforementioned certification arrangements. Given that the liquid electrolytes currently used in lithium-ion batteries are flammable, the TD pays particular attention in formulating the certification arrangements, and will require certification bodies to conduct certification tests on the batteries, such as over-charging or discharging control, short-circuit and overheating protection, vibration and mechanical shock tests, in accordance with standards adopted in the Chinese Mainland and other major jurisdictions in the world so as to ensure product safety. We are also exploring the possibility of including the non-flammable semi-solid and solid batteries into the certification scheme. The latest requirements adopted by other places, including fire safety requirements, will be suitably incorporated into the certification standards to be proposed by the TD, and will be updated in the future as appropriate. The TD also plans to include recommendations on the charging and use of battery in the code of practice. Carrying certified EMDs that are compliant with safety standards into indoor areas, including elevators, will not compromise fire safety.

In addition, the Government plans to establish clear guidelines under the product certification arrangements so that the responsibilities of various stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers and certification bodies, will be set out with clarity. As for EMD users, they must be at least 16 years old, wear a helmet and use compliant products.

The TD has all along been collaborating with the Road Safety Council and the HKPF in publicising messages on road safety and the use of EMDs through various channels, including publications, websites and social media platforms. We will continue to enhance safety awareness among the public through publicity and education. Upon introduction of the regulatory arrangements, relevant guidelines will also be incorporated in the code of practice to be issued by the TD as an ongoing effort to instil proper driving attitude and disseminate safety messages among EMD users.

As the topic has a wide coverage, the Government will conduct extensive consultation with stakeholders on the regulatory arrangement of EMDs. We plan to consult the Legislative Council Panel on Transport about the latest legislative proposal within this year.

Thank you, President."
立法會十六題：改善樓宇維修工程的管理,2026-02-04 14:48,2026-02-04 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400370.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上方國珊議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於二○一二年推出強制驗樓計劃，樓齡達30年或以上的私人樓宇有機會被揀選為目標樓宇，有關業主須於限期內完成驗樓，並在完成檢驗後訂明修葺項目。該計劃的目的是預防勝於治療，透過檢驗及維修的方式，處理樓宇失修問題。此外，有意見認為，不少樓宇缺乏管理，而且業主缺乏工程或樓宇維修相關知識。關於改善樓宇維修工程的管理，政府可否告知本會：

（一）全港18區各區現時樓齡達30年但仍未納入強制驗樓計劃的樓宇數目為何；會否研究以「大廈恆常維護」模式，取代現時的「一次性大維修」的模式；

（二）會否釐定有關樓宇維修工程的顧問服務收費標準，以防止投標者以不合理的低價搶標或合謀以「天價」圍標；鑑於市區重建局（市建局）推出樓宇復修公司登記計劃，為合資格的樓宇復修工程服務提供者進行評核及登記，並提供一站式資訊平台予業主搜尋服務提供者，政府是否知悉，市建局有否計劃審視該計劃登記公司的評分標準；

（三）鑑於有意見認為，樓宇同時進行多項維修工程或對現有住戶構成安全隱患，政府會否考慮規定須進行多項維修工程的樓宇，必須分拆維修項目，以降低其工程費用並減低圍標風險；及

（四）會否研究規定強制驗樓計劃下的樓宇須舉辦防火及大廈管理相關活動，例如火警演習及大廈管理工作坊，並須記錄存檔？

答覆：

主席：

​保養物業處於良好狀況是業主的基本責任。基於這一原則，政府採取雙管齊下的方式加強樓宇安全，一方面鼓勵及支援業主保養及修葺其物業，另一方面在失修樓宇構成公眾安全危險時，透過執法或先行代理業主進行修葺工程等方法主動介入處理。

就提問的各部分，經諮詢民政及青年事務局和保安局，現分別回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年底，全港樓齡達30年或以上並屬於強制驗樓計劃（計劃）所涵蓋樓宇類別的有超過20 000幢，當中約9 000幢樓宇已先後獲發強制驗樓通知，獲發通知的約七成為樓齡50年或以上樓宇。

未獲發強制驗樓通知的11 000多幢樓宇，按區議會分區分布表列如下：

總數
11944




要指出的是，樓宇並非一踏入30年樓齡便屬高風險。數據顯示樓齡高（50年或以上），以及沒有聘用物業管理公司的樓宇，樓宇狀況及保養一般較差，而這類型樓宇正是強制驗樓計劃的目標樓宇之一。屋宇署會繼續按風險揀選樓宇發出強制驗樓通知。

為減輕業主的財政壓力，「樓宇更新大行動2.0」計劃會資助合資格業主進行為遵辦強制驗樓通知所須的維修工程。與此同時，我們認同方議員提出的恆常維護理念。事實上，市區重建局（市建局）於二○二四年四月推出的全新「預防性維修資助計劃」，亦是提倡定期維修，推動業主為樓宇制定以10年為一個周期的維修保養計劃，並設立特別基金，讓業主向特別基金持續供款。當業主持續供款三年後，市建局會額外提供一筆過資助，金額相當於業主三年內供款總額的一成，鼓勵業主定期供款。計劃實施至今22個月，接獲18宗合資格申請，涉及11 400個住宅單位。

（二）發展局聯同市建局自二○一六年推出「招標妥」服務，安排獨立專業人士為業主提供第三方的專業意見和技術支援（例如就招標文件的工程範疇是否符合強制驗樓計劃要求提供意見，以及為相關維修項目提供工程費用估算作參考等），以及提供電子招標平台讓工程顧問和承建商參與競投。至於市建局的「樓宇復修公司登記計劃」，則旨在為樓宇業主提供免費資訊，包括對工程顧問和承建商在項目管理方面是否有專業人員的參與、施工管理和物料管理系統等的完整性作出評核。評核只是針對上述特定範疇，並非因應公司各方面的情況和表現作綜合評估以評定其作為服務提供者的適合性。

自宏福苑火災事件後，政府已隨即檢視安排，以期減低顧問、承建商和個別業主之間可能作出非法串連的機會並減低圍標風險。就此，發展局正與巿建局制定措施，加強巿建局在推動樓宇維修方面的角色和功能，提升巿建局的「招標妥」服務，包括制定更嚴謹的顧問及承建商「預審名單」，當中包括通過警方和廉政公署的背景審查。

發展局亦建議在加強版「招標妥」下，由市建局為業主就聘用顧問和承建商進行招標和評標工作。我們相信有了巿建局在招標階段把關，一些超出合理範圍的標價（不論是過低或過高）都難以獲接納。

（三）將樓宇需要維修的項目分拆予不同承建商進行，需要小心考慮當中涉及的問題，例如地盤能否容納不同承建商同時運作、業主如何統籌各承建商之間的協作、會否增加整體工程費用及所需的時間等。我們認為上文（二）提及有關更嚴謹的「預審名單」和只有通過預審的顧問和承建商才能參與投標的規定，再加上巿建局在揀選顧問和承建商時的主導角色，不但有助確定標價的合理性，也能減低顧問和承建商的串通機會和圍標風險。

此外，因應由政務司司長主持的調查及規管工作組所提出的建議，民政及青年事務局會加強《建築物管理條例》（第344章）的有關規定，要求法團在議決工程或開支項目時，要按合約金額設定不同級別的業主表決要求，包括金額越高的項目，所需業主出席及親自投票的門檻也相應提高，避免授權書制度被濫用而讓不法分子乘虛而入。

（四）屋宇署、市建局、消防處及民政事務總署一直透過民政事務總署的「大廈管理中央平台」，定期為業主、法團和業委會舉辦地區簡介會，介紹與大廈管理及維修相關的服務／計劃，包括遵辦強制驗樓計劃等事項，加強對他們的支援。

消防安全方面，根據《消防（裝置及設備）規例》（第95B章），消防裝置或設備的擁有人須保持該等裝置或設備時刻在有效操作狀態，並須每12個月由一名註冊承辦商檢查該等裝置或設備至少一次。

在宏福苑大火後，政府已經即時成立了「強化消防安全治理工作組」，推出多項即時措施及部署中長期方案，以提升消防安全。當中包括積極加強對公眾、法團及物業管理公司等的宣傳教育和培訓工作，例如鼓勵他們加密警鐘測試至最少每半年一次、每年最少舉辦一次防火演習、在演習前安排消防處進行防災應急講座和定時巡查逃生途徑並作出妥善紀錄，以及在大維修前先檢查和維修所有消防裝置或設備。

消防處亦一直致力推動公眾安全宣傳教育，包括持續透過報章專訪、新聞稿及短片等不同形式的宣傳渠道和舉辦各式活動，向市民宣傳基本的消防安全知識。此外，消防處剛推出「樓宇應急先鋒」計劃，專門為物業管理人員、業主立案法團代表和住戶提供有關樓宇消防安全和進行消防巡查的訓練。這些「樓宇應急先鋒」可協助辨識屋苑範圍內是否出現安全隱患，並參與消防巡查及向消防處或物業管理公司報告風險，共同提升樓宇的消防安全。政府正積極研究修例需要，包括將上述合適的行政措施提升為法例要求等，以進一步保障市民的生命和財產。

民政事務總署會繼續與消防處緊密合作，安排更多消防安全講座和演練，鼓勵樓宇住戶（包括強制驗樓計劃下的樓宇）參與，提升居民在火警發生時的應變能力。"
LCQ16: Improving management of building maintenance works,2026-02-04 14:48,2026-02-04 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400386.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Christine Fong and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

In 2012, the Government launched the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme (MBIS). Under the MBIS, private buildings aged 30 years or above may be selected as target buildings, and the owners concerned are required to complete building inspections within a deadline and prescribe repair works upon completion of the inspections. The MBIS aims to uphold the principle of ""prevention is better than cure"" by tackling the problem of building neglect through inspection and maintenance. In addition, there are views that quite a number of buildings lack proper management, and owners do not have knowledge of works or building maintenance. On improving the management of building maintenance works, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current number of buildings aged 30 years in each of the 18 ‍districts across the territory which have not yet been brought under the MBIS; whether it will consider replacing the existing ""one-off major maintenance"" model with a ""regular building maintenance"" model;

(2) whether it will draw up standard fees and charges for consultancy services relating to building maintenance works in order to prevent bidders from undercutting with unreasonably low prices or engaging in bid‑rigging by colluding to charge exorbitant costs; given that the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) has launched the Building Rehabilitation Company Registration Scheme, which aims to assess and register qualified building rehabilitation service providers as well as providing a one-stop information platform for owners to search for service providers, whether the Government knows if the URA has plans to review the scoring criteria for companies registered under the Scheme;

(3) as there are views that carrying out multiple maintenance works simultaneously in a building may pose safety hazards to existing occupants, whether the Government will consider requiring buildings which need to undertake multiple maintenance works to split up the works into smaller projects so as to lower the project costs and reduce the risk of bid-rigging; and

(4) whether it will consider requiring buildings under the MBIS to organise fire safety and building management-related activities, such as fire drills and building management workshops, and to keep records of such activities on file?

Reply:

President,

It is the fundamental responsibility of owners to maintain their properties in good condition. Based on this principle, the Government adopts a two-pronged approach to enhance building safety. On one hand, we encourage and support owners in the maintenance and repair of their properties. On the other hand, when dilapidated buildings pose danger to public safety, the Government will take the initiative to intervene through enforcement actions or by carrying out emergency repair works on behalf of the owners.

In consultation with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) and the Security Bureau, our reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) By the end of 2025, there were over 20000 buildings in Hong Kong aged 30 years or above that are under the coverage of the building categories of the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme (MBIS). Among which, about 9000 buildings have been successively issued with MBIS notices. Among those buildings issued with notices, about 70 per cent are aged 50 years or above.

​The remaining some 11000 buildings which have not yet been issued with MBIS notices are tabulated below, breakdown by District Council (DC) districts:

It should be noted that buildings do not automatically become high-risk upon reaching 30 years of age. Statistics indicate that buildings of a higher age (50 years or above), as well as those without a property management company, generally exhibit poorer condition and maintenance. Such buildings are precisely among the targets of the MBIS. The Buildings Department (BD) will continue to select buildings on a risk basis to issue MBIS notices.

To alleviate the financial burden on owners, Operation Building Bright 2.0 provides subsidies to eligible owners for carrying out repair works required for compliance with MBIS notices. At the same time, we concur with Hon Fong's concept of regular maintenance. In fact, the new Preventive Maintenance Subsidy Scheme, launched by the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) in April 2024, also promotes regular maintenance. It encourages owners to formulate building maintenance plan on a 10-year maintenance cycle basis, and to establish a special fund for owners to make continuous contributions. After three years of continuous contributions, the URA will provide a one-off grant equivalent to 10 per cent of the total contributions made by the owners over the three-year period, thereby encouraging regular contributions. Since its implementation 22 months ago, the scheme has received 18 eligible applications involving 11 400 residential units.

(2) The Development Bureau (DEVB), in collaboration with the URA, has been providing the ""Smart Tender"" service since 2016. This service arranges for independent professionals to provide third-party professional advice and technical support to owners (such as advising on whether the scope of works in the tender documents complies with the requirements of the MBIS and providing reference cost estimates for relevant repair works items), as well as providing an electronic tendering platform for works consultants and contractors to participate in bidding. As for the URA's Building Rehabilitation Company Registration Scheme, it aims to provide building owners with free information, including assessments of whether works consultants and contractors have engaged professional personnel in project management, and completeness of their construction management and materials management systems. These assessments focus solely on the aforementioned specific areas and do not constitute a comprehensive evaluation of the company's overall circumstances and performance in determining its suitability as a service provider.

Following the fire incident at Wang Fuk Court, the Government has immediately reviewed the current arrangements with a view to reducing the opportunities for illegal collusion among consultants, contractors, and individual owners, as well as reducing the risk of bid-rigging. In this connection, the DEVB is collaborating with the URA to formulate measures to strengthen the URA's role and functions in promoting building rehabilitation. This includes enhancing the ""Smart Tender"" service by establishing a more rigorous ""pre-qualified list"" of consultants and contractors, including background checks by the Police and the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

The DEVB also proposes that under the enhanced ""Smart Tender"", the URA will conduct tendering and tender proposal evaluation procedures on behalf of owners for the appointment of consultants and contractors. We believe that with the URA acting as a gatekeeper during the tendering stage, it will also be difficult to accept tender prices that fall outside the reasonable range (whether exceedingly low or high).
​
(3) Allocating building repair items to different contractors requires careful consideration of associated issues, such as whether the site can accommodate simultaneous operations by multiple contractors, how owners will co-ordinate collaboration between contractors, and whether this will increase overall project costs and duration. We believe that the more rigorous ""pre-qualified list"" and the requirement that only pre-qualified consultants and contractors may participate in bidding as mentioned in part (2) above, coupled with the URA's leading role in the selection of consultants and contractors, will not only help ensure the reasonableness of tender prices but also reduce the opportunities for collusion and the risk of bid-rigging among consultants and contractors.

Furthermore, in response to the recommendations put forward by the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the HYAB will strengthen the relevant provisions of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344). When making decisions on works or expenditure items, Owners' Corporations (OCs) will be required to comply with different levels of voting requirements for owners according to contract amounts. Projects of higher values require a higher threshold of quorum and voting-in-person, thereby preventing abuse of the system of proxy and being taken advantage of by criminals.

(4) The BD, the URA, the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the Home Affairs Department (HAD) have been organising regular district briefing sessions for owners, OCs, and Owners' Committees through the HAD's Central Platform on Building Management. These sessions introduce services and schemes related to building management and maintenance, including matters such as compliance with the MBIS, thereby strengthening the support provided to them.

In respect of fire safety, according to the Fire Service (Installations and Equipment) Regulations (Cap. 95B), the owner of any fire service installation or equipment (FSI) which is installed in any premises shall keep such FSI in efficient working order at all times; and have such FSI inspected by a registered contractor at least once in every 12 months.

Following the fire at Wang Fuk Court, the Government immediately established the Task Force on Strengthening Fire Safety Governance to implement both immediate measures and deploy medium to long term initiatives with the aim of enhancing fire safety. These include actively stepping up publicity, education, and training efforts for the public, OCs and property management companies (PMCs), etc. For example, encouraging them to increase the frequency of fire alarm tests to at least once in every six months, to organise at least one fire drill annually, to arrange the FSD to deliver disaster prevention and emergency preparedness seminars prior to such drills, regularly inspect means of escape and maintain proper records, as well as to check and repair all FSIs before carrying out major maintenance works.

The FSD is also committed to promoting public safety education. Ongoing efforts are being made to disseminate basic fire safety knowledge to the public through various channels, including newspaper interviews, press releases, short videos, and a wide range of activities. Besides, the FSD has newly established the Building Emergency Responders Scheme which provides specialised training for property management personnel, representatives of OCs, and residents on building fire safety and fire safety inspections. These Building Emergency Responders can assist in identifying potential safety hazards within housing estates, participate in fire safety inspections, and report risks to the FSD or PMCs, jointly enhancing fire safety in buildings. The Government is actively examining the need for legislative amendments, including elevating the abovementioned administrative measures to statutory requirements as appropriate, with a view to further safeguarding the lives and property of the public.

The HAD will continue to work closely with the FSD to arrange more fire safety talks and drills, and encourage building occupants (including buildings under the MBIS) to participate, so as to enhance residents' response capabilities in the event of a fire."

立法會十一題：街市的出租及經營情況,2026-02-04 14:18,2026-02-04 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400275.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上陳穎欣議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉不少為市民提供日常食品及必需品的公眾街市檔販面對加租壓力。就香港房屋委員會（房委會）及食物環境衞生署（食環署）轄下街市商鋪的出租及經營情況，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年房委會和食環署轄下各個街市的攤檔數目、檔位出租率、檔位出租類別，以及空置數目和空置率分別為何；

（二）過去三年，每年房委會和食環署轄下各個街市的租金調整情況為何；

（三）鑑於有意見認為，現時房委會和食環署轄下街市商户的經營情況嚴峻，政府有否考慮為該等商户提供經濟支援措施，例如寬減租金；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（四）食環署有否考慮善用轄下街市的空置檔位，容許網購生鮮冷凍食品公司提供具自助取貨功能的智能櫃，讓市民在公餘時間前往街市自取貨物，以刺激街市人流；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）鑑於房委會推行「共築・創業家」計劃，以免租形式向35歲或以下的青年提供旗下商場鋪位作創業用途，食環署有否考慮參考該計劃，向有意創業的青年免租金提供空置的「非食物類」檔位作為創業點；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

食物環境衞生署（食環署）現時負責管理轄下95個公眾街市。因應市民的消費模式和對公眾街市需求的轉變，食環署近年採取了多項措施，優化公眾街市的營運環境和管理。

另外，香港房屋委員會（房委會）除了為有住屋需要的低收入家庭提供可負擔的租住房屋，並按情況提供街市等其他附屬設施，以照顧居民日常所需。目前，房委會轄下設有33個街市，並透過靈活租賃和持續檢視行業組合，為居民提供適切的購物選擇。

就陳穎欣議員的各項提問，經諮詢房屋署，現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年（即二○二三年至二○二五年），有關食環署及房委會轄下各個街市的攤檔數目、出租率、空置攤檔數目、空置率，以及攤檔類別的資料，分別載於附件一及附件二。

（二）食環署按既定調整機制，根據甲類消費物價指數的平均按年變動率，在攤檔租約續期時或租約訂明的租金調整日按年調整租金，以反映通脹水平。過去三年（即二○二三年至二○二五年），食環署轄下各個街市的租金調整介乎1.7%至2.6%，詳見附件三。

至於房委會轄下街市的租金調整，房委會在檔位租約期滿時，會參考房委會其他檔位及私人物業市場的租金資料，並考慮各項相關因素（包括各行業檔位的經營環境、檔位所在位置、面積、人流情況等）為每個個案按市值評估續約租金。就在當前的經濟環境下面對較大挑戰的某些行業，房委會在評估該些檔位的租金時，會務實考慮其實際經營環境作出租金下調的考慮，以協助緩解經營壓力，並會繼續留意經濟情況和政府相關措施，為商戶按需要提供適切的協助。由於各類檔位的續約租金調整幅度因以上因素而有不同，不能一概而論。

（三）過往幾年，政府曾多次推出措施支援企業，當中食環署轄下公眾街市和房委會轄下街市攤檔租戶均獲租金寬免。最近一次在二○二三年七月，檔戶獲寬減五成租金，為期六個月，合共逾12 000個檔戶受惠。政府會繼續密切留意經濟情況，並適時評估推出相關支援措施的需要。

（四）食環署一直積極和持份者（包括租戶、地區人士、販商聯會和物流服務商等）溝通，探討進一步善用街市攤檔和空間的措施，包括增設合適設施以切合市民和經營者需要。以香港仔街市和九龍城街市為例，食環署已將該街市部分公共空間租予物流服務商設置自助取貨智能櫃，方便市民取件並帶動街市人流。去年，署方亦安排了有意在街市提供速遞收發服務的營運商實地考察，以協助他們物色合適地點設置服務站／營業點。另一方面，倘若網購生鮮冷凍食品公司有意提供自助取貨服務，相關食物包裝、運輸和儲存的運作須符合食物安全、許可證條件和街市營運的要求。食環署會繼續以開放態度考慮各項配合社會需要和有助改善公眾街市營運的建議。

（五）政府歡迎青年人利用街市或小販攤檔創業。食環署正透過和非牟利組織合作，讓青年人運營觀塘裕民市集內約20多個空置攤位，售賣手工藝品、生活用品和雜貨等。食環署亦計劃在香港仔街市推出類似計劃，現正物色合適的合作夥伴。署方會參考香港仔街市的計劃推展情況，探討如何進一步善用署方空置攤檔，支援青年人創業。"
LCQ11: Leasing and operation situation of markets,2026-02-04 14:18,2026-02-04 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400286.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Joephy Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

It is learnt that quite a number of operators of public market stalls providing daily food and necessities for members of the public are facing the pressure of rent increases. Regarding the leasing and operation situation of shops in public markets under the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of stalls, occupancy rates of stalls and categories of let-out stalls, as well as the respective numbers and rates of vacant stalls, in the various markets under the HA and the FEHD in each of the past three years;

(2) of the rental adjustment arrangements for the various markets under the HA and the FEHD in each of the past three years;

(3) as there are views that tenants of markets under the HA and the FEHD are currently facing a very difficult operating environment, whether the Government has considered providing financial support measures, such as rent concessions, for such tenants; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether the FEHD has considered making good use of vacant stalls in the markets under its purview by allowing online shops selling fresh and frozen food to provide self-pickup smart lockers, so that members of the public may collect their purchased items at markets outside working hours, thereby stimulating footfall in the markets; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) given that the HA has implemented the Well Being·Start-Up programme to offer shop premises in shopping centres under its purview rent-free to young people aged 35 or below for start-up purposes, whether the FEHD has considered, by drawing reference from such programme, providing vacant ""non-food"" stalls rent-free as start-up points for young people who wish to start their businesses; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is currently responsible for managing 95 public markets under its purview. In view of evolving consumption patterns of the general public and demand for public markets, the FEHD has, in recent years, implemented various measures to enhance the operating environmental and management of public markets.

Separately, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) provides, in addition to affordable rental housing for low-income families with housing needs, ancillary facilities such as markets, as appropriate, to meet residents' daily needs. At present, there are a total of 33 markets under the HKHA's purview, offering residents with appropriate shopping options through flexible leasing arrangements and ongoing review of the trade mix.

In consultation with the Housing Department, the reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Joephy Chan is as follows:

(1)Information about the number of stalls, occupancy rates, number of vacant stalls, vacancy rates and stall categories in markets under the purview of the FEHD and the HKHA in the past three years (2023 – 2025) are set out in Annex 1 and Annex 2 respectively.

(2)The FEHD adjusts stall rental annually upon renewal of tenancy agreement or on the due date for rental adjustment as specified in the tenancy agreement according to the average of the year-on-year rates of change in Consumer Price Index (A) according to established mechanism, so as to catch up with inflation. In the past three years (2023 – 2025), the rental adjustment of the FEHD's public market stalls ranged between 1.7 per cent and 2.6 per cent, as detailed in Annex 3.

As for the rent adjustments for market shopstalls under the HKHA, upon expiry of shopstall tenancy agreements, the HKHA assesses the renewal rents on a case-by-case basis according to the prevailing market value of the shopstall concerned, taking into account the rental status of other comparable lettings under the HKHA as well as the private property market; and relevant factors which would affect rental values such as the business environment of the trades, the location, as well as the size and the pedestrian flow of the shopstall concerned, etc. As for certain sectors which are facing greater challenges under the current economic climate, the HKHA will pragmatically take into account their actual operating conditions and may consider rent reduction to help alleviate their operational pressure when assessing rents for these trades. Given that the extent of rent adjustments upon renewal across different types of shopstalls varies due to the above factors, it cannot be generalised.

(3)Over the past few years, the Government has introduced various measures to support businesses, including rental concessions to stall tenants of the FEHD's public markets and the HKHA's markets. The most recent concession took effect in July 2023, under which tenants were offered a 50per cent rental concession for six months, benefiting over 12 000 stall tenants. The Government will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and assess the need for further support measures as appropriate.

(4)The FEHD has been maintaining close communication with stakeholders (including tenants, local representatives, trade associations and logistic operators etc) to explore measures to better utilise market stalls and space, including adding suitable facilities to cater to both the needs of public and operators. For example, in Aberdeen Market and Kowloon City Market, parts of their common areas have been leased to logistic operators for installation of smart lockers for self-service parcel collection, bringing convenience to public and helping to attract patronage of public markets. Last year, the FEHD also arranged site visits for operators interested in providing parcel delivery and collection services in markets, to assist them in identifying appropriate locations for setting up service points or business counters. Separately, if companies engaged in the online sale of fresh or frozen food wish to provide self-service collection facilities, relevant food packaging, transport and storage operations must comply with the requirements/condition in respect of food safety, relevant permits and market operation. The FEHD will continue to consider, with an open mind, proposals that meet the needs of the society and can help enhancepublic market operation.

(5)The Government welcomes young people to make use of market stalls or hawker pitches to start their own businesses. The FEHD is collaborating with non-profit organisations to provide 20 vacant stalls in Yue Man Hawker Bazaar, Kwun Tong for young people to sell handicrafts, household wares and groceries, etc. The FEHD is also planning to launch a similar scheme in Aberdeen Market and is currently identifying suitable partners. The department will take into account the implementation of the scheme in Aberdeen Market and further explore ways to make use of vacant stalls to support young entrepreneurship."

Sunny（香港生產力促進局主席陳祖恒）、Mohamed（香港生產力促進局總裁畢堅文）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

​大家好！很高興出席由生產力局主辦的智瞻2026論壇。今天的論壇集合了來自工商界、科技界和學術界的精英，以及為數不少的出色創業者，一起探討香港在科技變革浪潮中的各種新機遇。

今年論壇的主題聚焦於如何構建更蓬勃的創科生態，連接香港與國家「十五五」規劃的新機遇，可以説是正值其時。今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，「十五五」規劃建議去年十月公布後，在創科方面，有幾個十分重要的提述。

第一個提述是建設現代化產業體系，其中兩個重點：一是優化提升傳統產業，讓這些產業提質升級，包括更智能化和綠色化，其中「全面實施『人工智能+』行動，全方位賦能千行百業」更是引領變革的重點。二是培育壯大新興產業和未來產業，其中特別提到的幾個前沿科技項目，包括量子科技、生物製造、氫能和核聚變能、腦機介面、具身智慧、第六代移動通信等。

第二個提述是加快高水平科技自立自強，其中推動科技創新和產業創新深度融合，以及一體推進教育、科技、人才發展是重點。面對卡脖子的恐嚇，更要攻堅克難。

第三個提述就是香港的創科定位。國家一直大力支持香港創科發展，不論是在「十四五」規劃或者是「十五五」規劃建議中，均明確支持香港建設國際創科中心。

這些提述無疑為香港未來的創科發展點明了方向。香港連同粵港澳大灣區兄弟城市，擁有多家百強大學、深厚的科研實力、完備的生產體系、活躍的創投生態，以及最蓬勃的創科集群，讓我們能夠匯聚海內外創新資源和人才，一方面服務國家的創科發展大局，另一方面推進香港自身的高質量發展，開創更大的機遇。

具體來説，香港可以在多個維度扮演重要的角色。

第一，是以金融支持和賦能科技發展。大家都知道，香港的新股市場在去年領先全球，119家公司去年上市，籌資超過2,800億元，其中信息科技、生物科技、新能源和先進工業等企業的籌資額佔了約70%。多年來我們進行市場改革，鼓勵更多科技企業來港上市，近年18C章的改革，更能便利未商業化的硬科技公司上市。而除了股市以外，香港同時有蓬勃的私募基金和風投創投生態，根據最新的數字，他們管理的資產達到2,300億美元，在亞洲僅次於內地。換句話説，香港有非常完整的全鏈條資金生態，能夠服務不同發展階段的創科企業的需要。

但如何進一步動員更多資金投入新興和未來產業呢？特別是那些前沿科技領域，畢竟這些領域需要長期的投入，也具有相當高的風險。這就牽涉到建構「耐心資本」的力量，以引導資金投小、投早、投長期、投硬科技。港投公司在這方面便發揮了帶頭作用。港投公司至今投資了超過170個項目，其每投資一元，拉動的市場資金超過六元，所投資領域包括人工智能、生物科技、綠色科技等。

第二，建立更蓬勃的創科生態，加速培育新質生產力。過去幾年，特區政府對科研機構和科研大力投入，香港的創科氛圍也越見蓬勃，去年本港初創企業數目超過5 200家，增長11%，創歷史新高。政府針對不同的創科環節都作出支持，包括推出「產學研1+計劃」、「新型工業加速計劃」、「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」等等。

我們明白加速創科的發展和產業群聚，龍頭科技企業是關鍵。創科局（創新科技及工業局）、引進重點企業辦公室（引進辦）、投資推廣署等過去數年一直努力吸引全球從事前沿科技的企業來港，以引進辦為例，過去三年來已經吸引超過100家企業落戶，投資超過600億元，帶來22 000個研發或管理的職位，合共使用的樓面達到185萬平方尺。

創科產業發展需要土地承載，而北部都會區（北都）是香港創科發展的重要載體，也是香港與粵港澳大灣區兄弟城市合作、聯動發展的重要基地。特區政府正全方位加快北都的建設，以靈活的發展模式、專屬的法例、行政上的拆牆鬆綁，加上度身訂造的優惠政策包，例如土地批撥、比較相宜的地價、財政資助和稅務減免等，吸引高潛力企業和高增值產業落戶北都，帶來技術、就業和相關的高增值製造業。而剛在十二月開幕的河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區，將與深圳園區試行人員、物資、資金和數據等四項要素的便捷流動。

第三是培育人才。人才是科技創新的關鍵要素。高端人才與優質企業的吸引又是相輔相成：因為優質企業能吸引到高質量的人才，而人才匯聚，又可以幫助我們吸引更多優質企業落戶發展，形成良性循環。因此，政府致力貫徹「以人才推動科技，以科技引領產業，以產業匯聚人才」的發展方針。

我們是雙線並行：一是鼓勵本地的大專院校培育創科人才。最近幾年就讀STEM（科學、科技、工程及數學）學科的學生數字上升不少，是可喜的趨勢。二是吸引全球人才來港，特別是在當前地緣政局下，不少華裔的科學家、工程師都更願意來港發展事業。除了各項吸引人才計劃外，我們推出了30億元的「前沿科技研究支援計劃」，支援本地資助大學吸引更多國際頂尖科研領軍人物來港，建設香港成為國際高端人才聚集高地。

未來，我們會繼續積極對接國家發展策略，推動科技創新和產業創新深度融合，進一步強化科技與產業的連結，鼓勵企業加大研發投入，擴展科技應用範疇，培育具國際視野與前瞻思維的創新企業，推動經濟向高增值、多元化的未來邁進。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，生產力局致力提升中小企業的生產力及效率，一直是政府以及業界的重要合作夥伴。今天由生產力局舉辦的論壇正正是透過聚焦討論，集合各界力量，推動香港在國家加速發展新質生產力的新征程中擔當新角色。我在此感謝生產力局作出的努力和貢獻。

最後，恭賀今天的活動圓滿成功。各位朋友，很快又到馬年了，藉這個機會，祝大家馬年龍馬精神、身體健康、事業宏達、家庭幸運。謝謝大家！"
財政司司長出席香港生產力促進局智瞻2026致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-02-04 14:05,2026-02-04 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400429.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（二月四日）出席香港生產力促進局（生產力局）智瞻2026的致辭：

Sunny（香港生產力促進局主席陳祖恒）、Mohamed（香港生產力促進局總裁畢堅文）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

​大家好！很高興出席由生產力局主辦的智瞻2026論壇。今天的論壇集合了來自工商界、科技界和學術界的精英，以及為數不少的出色創業者，一起探討香港在科技變革浪潮中的各種新機遇。

今年論壇的主題聚焦於如何構建更蓬勃的創科生態，連接香港與國家「十五五」規劃的新機遇，可以説是正值其時。今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，「十五五」規劃建議去年十月公布後，在創科方面，有幾個十分重要的提述。

第一個提述是建設現代化產業體系，其中兩個重點：一是優化提升傳統產業，讓這些產業提質升級，包括更智能化和綠色化，其中「全面實施『人工智能+』行動，全方位賦能千行百業」更是引領變革的重點。二是培育壯大新興產業和未來產業，其中特別提到的幾個前沿科技項目，包括量子科技、生物製造、氫能和核聚變能、腦機介面、具身智慧、第六代移動通信等。

第二個提述是加快高水平科技自立自強，其中推動科技創新和產業創新深度融合，以及一體推進教育、科技、人才發展是重點。面對卡脖子的恐嚇，更要攻堅克難。

第三個提述就是香港的創科定位。國家一直大力支持香港創科發展，不論是在「十四五」規劃或者是「十五五」規劃建議中，均明確支持香港建設國際創科中心。

這些提述無疑為香港未來的創科發展點明了方向。香港連同粵港澳大灣區兄弟城市，擁有多家百強大學、深厚的科研實力、完備的生產體系、活躍的創投生態，以及最蓬勃的創科集群，讓我們能夠匯聚海內外創新資源和人才，一方面服務國家的創科發展大局，另一方面推進香港自身的高質量發展，開創更大的機遇。

具體來説，香港可以在多個維度扮演重要的角色。

第一，是以金融支持和賦能科技發展。大家都知道，香港的新股市場在去年領先全球，119家公司去年上市，籌資超過2,800億元，其中信息科技、生物科技、新能源和先進工業等企業的籌資額佔了約70%。多年來我們進行市場改革，鼓勵更多科技企業來港上市，近年18C章的改革，更能便利未商業化的硬科技公司上市。而除了股市以外，香港同時有蓬勃的私募基金和風投創投生態，根據最新的數字，他們管理的資產達到2,300億美元，在亞洲僅次於內地。換句話説，香港有非常完整的全鏈條資金生態，能夠服務不同發展階段的創科企業的需要。

但如何進一步動員更多資金投入新興和未來產業呢？特別是那些前沿科技領域，畢竟這些領域需要長期的投入，也具有相當高的風險。這就牽涉到建構「耐心資本」的力量，以引導資金投小、投早、投長期、投硬科技。港投公司在這方面便發揮了帶頭作用。港投公司至今投資了超過170個項目，其每投資一元，拉動的市場資金超過六元，所投資領域包括人工智能、生物科技、綠色科技等。

第二，建立更蓬勃的創科生態，加速培育新質生產力。過去幾年，特區政府對科研機構和科研大力投入，香港的創科氛圍也越見蓬勃，去年本港初創企業數目超過5 200家，增長11%，創歷史新高。政府針對不同的創科環節都作出支持，包括推出「產學研1+計劃」、「新型工業加速計劃」、「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」等等。

我們明白加速創科的發展和產業群聚，龍頭科技企業是關鍵。創科局（創新科技及工業局）、引進重點企業辦公室（引進辦）、投資推廣署等過去數年一直努力吸引全球從事前沿科技的企業來港，以引進辦為例，過去三年來已經吸引超過100家企業落戶，投資超過600億元，帶來22 000個研發或管理的職位，合共使用的樓面達到185萬平方尺。

創科產業發展需要土地承載，而北部都會區（北都）是香港創科發展的重要載體，也是香港與粵港澳大灣區兄弟城市合作、聯動發展的重要基地。特區政府正全方位加快北都的建設，以靈活的發展模式、專屬的法例、行政上的拆牆鬆綁，加上度身訂造的優惠政策包，例如土地批撥、比較相宜的地價、財政資助和稅務減免等，吸引高潛力企業和高增值產業落戶北都，帶來技術、就業和相關的高增值製造業。而剛在十二月開幕的河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區，將與深圳園區試行人員、物資、資金和數據等四項要素的便捷流動。

​立法會四題：渣打香港馬拉松,2026-02-04 13:20,2026-02-04 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400411.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上楊永杰議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的答覆︰

問題：

據報渣打香港馬拉松2026（渣馬）有逾12萬人報名，超額報名情況創歷屆新高。有意見指出當局應優化渣馬，以容納更多跑手，強化其盛事經濟效應。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否與中國香港田徑總會（田總）商討增加渣馬賽事日子及組別，以擴大賽事規模；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（二）會否與田總商討將不同海濱場地納入渣馬賽道，以打造「海濱馬拉松」；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）會否與田總合作，共同爭取將渣馬落實成為世界馬拉松大滿貫賽事之一，以吸引更多海外跑手來港參賽？

答覆：

多謝代主席。

渣打香港馬拉松（渣馬）由中國香港田徑總會（田總）主辦，自從二○○五年開始獲得「M」品牌認可及贊助，並且發展成為本港一年一度最具規模及代表性的長跑體育盛事，深受本地及海外跑步愛好者歡迎。

政府樂見田總在贊助商、各政府部門，以及各持份者的支持和積極配合下，持續提升賽事的規模、水平及國際吸引力。渣馬的參加人數由一九九七年首屆約1 000人，增至二○二六年約74 000人。今年的賽事還包括20位特邀的海外世界頂尖運動員，以及約19 250名來自超過110個國家及地區的個人跑手，非本地選手佔比達百分之二十五，為歷屆新高，顯示賽事的國際吸引力不斷提升。

就楊永杰議員的提問，政府綜合回覆如下：

渣馬屬成功的大型體育盛事，既能帶動旅客訪港增加消費，亦能推動香港整體的體育氛圍，因此政府支持田總持續舉辦和在可行的情況下擴大賽事的規模。我們認為田總在籌劃繼續推動賽事發展的時候，需要審慎考慮發展目標，即是否提升賽事專業水平以達至更高級別的賽事，或是提升市民和旅客的參與程度，並增加名額，以嘉年華、與眾同樂方向去發展。雖然這兩個方向並非不可共存，但是清晰的目標與方向對渣馬的持續成功發展至為重要。

文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）已經要求田總就推動渣馬發展，包括上述兩個目標，積極研究並提出建議。我們得悉田總已經成立專責工作小組展開有關工作，我們期望田總能在數月內提交具體計劃書，而文體旅局和相關政府部門會給予意見及支援。我們相信田總提出清晰的發展建議會有助贊助商和各持份者研究如何配合及支持。

政府認同田總在渣馬未來發展的時候，應考慮各種可能性，包括賽道、舉行時間、參與人數等等。就賽道而言，隨着更多海濱優化項目（例如東岸公園主段）相繼落成，政府歡迎不同的跑步比賽及活動能利用地標性的海濱地段，以提升跑手體驗及展示香港獨特城市景觀。文體旅局已經要求田總透過專責工作小組審視不同方案，並就賽道情況、氣候條件、跑手體驗、安全考慮、緊急應變機制，以及對市民日常生活的影響等因素作整體評估。

目前，渣馬已獲世界田徑聯會認可為「金級道路賽」，吸引大量本地及海外跑手參與，已經是一項國際有名的馬拉松賽事。「白金級道路賽」又或「世界馬拉松大滿貫」系列是屬全球馬拉松賽事的最高級別，有大量的世界級馬拉松精英運動員參加。若這些賽事能夠在香港舉行，會對香港的國際形象及體育旅遊發展有十分積極的作用。正如我之前所述，田總需要仔細研究發展渣馬的方向。如果是向更高國際水平賽事方向進發，田總需研究相關的要求及要達標的可行性。政府期望田總盡早完成可行性評估，訂立清晰的發展方向，以便政府提供相應的配合和支持。

政府明白社會對擴大渣馬規模、優化賽道設計及提升賽事國際地位的期望。我們將在安全、符合成本效益、維持賽事質素等核心範疇下，繼續向田總提供建議和協助，讓田總可以全面為渣馬發展提出具體建議。我們會致力在推動體育發展、促進旅遊效益及維持社會運作之間取得平衡，讓參加者、市民及整個香港社會都能夠受惠。

多謝代主席。"

問題：

據報房屋署和社會福利署於去年七月在觀塘及沙田展開試點計劃，透過整合雙方的數據協助地區服務及關愛隊伍（關愛隊）更精準地識別及支援獨居長者或雙老住户。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）試點計劃展開後，關愛隊在該兩個試點地區的支援長者工作進展為何，包括至今已協助提供的室內或穿戴式緊急召援系統（俗稱「平安鐘」）數目，以及有否計劃引入其他樂齡科技產品予長者使用，並將試點計劃擴展至全港18區；

（二）試點計劃所整合的數據有否包括長者家庭成員、長者健康狀況、社區支援需求及申領政府援助的狀況等資料；現時負責分析及統籌該等數據的政府部門為何；及

（三）會否盡快構建全面的「獨居長者、雙老家庭」數據庫，並結合比對分析社會福利署、房屋署和醫院管理局等政府部門和公營機構的數據，更好地協助獨居長者和雙老家庭；如會，時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府透過推行多元化措施，為有需要的長者提供資助社區照顧及支援服務，包括長者日間護理服務、家居照顧及支援服務、長者社區照顧服務券計劃等。同時，照顧者作為長者和殘疾人士在社區生活的重要支撐，政府一直不遺餘力地加強對護老者和殘疾人士照顧者的支援，以減輕他們的身心壓力，同時為被照顧者提供更全面的照料。

接下來我會闡述各項相關政策措施，就陳曼琪議員提問的各部分綜合回覆。

地區服務及關愛隊伍—支援長者及照顧者計劃

為協助識別有需要的獨老及雙老住戶、護老者和殘疾人士照顧者，政府於二○二四年三月以試點模式，在荃灣及南區推行「地區服務及關愛隊伍—支援長者及照顧者計劃」，並於二○二五年四月把此計劃擴展至全港18區。截至二○二五年十二月底，各區共超過450隊的關愛隊在此計劃下已探訪或接觸超過79 000個有需要的獨老及雙老住戶、護老者和殘疾人士照顧者住戶，提供關愛、支援和服務轉介，當中超過2 700個住戶成功獲得資助安裝平安鐘服務。

樂齡科技

同時，政府一直推動社會更廣泛應用樂齡和康復科技。政府於二○一八年撥款十億元設立「樂齡及康復創科應用基金」，資助合資格安老及康復服務單位購置、租用或試用科技產品，以改善服務使用者生活質素，減輕護理人員及照顧者的負擔和壓力。正如我兩星期前書面答覆議會所指，政府二○二四至二五年度向基金額外注資十億元，讓合資格的社區安老及康復服務單位申請購置合適的科技產品，供長者及其照顧者借回家中，使科技產品的使用範圍擴展至家居。

為加強支援照顧者，勞工及福利局（勞福局）正按《行政長官2025年施政報告》所述，將在今年內為300戶高風險照顧者住戶，包括長者及殘疾人士住戶，試行安裝智能意外偵測系統，希望能達致即時偵測、及早介入、迅速援助的效果，預計最快今年第一季內公布具體安排，並爭取在第三季或之前完成安裝。參與試行計劃的住戶費用全免。我們會委聘大學評估實行計劃的成效，作為日後繼續推行、調整或改善措施的參考。

支援照顧者數據平台

至於支援照顧者數據平台方面，勞福局及社會福利署（社署）於二○二五年七月分別推行了兩個試點計劃。首先是提問（一）提及的與房屋署的合作。這項計劃的目的是為高風險但未接受社福服務支援的群組建立社區支援網。我們透過整合兩個部門的數據，識別出較年長、較缺乏社區支援的獨老或雙老高風險住戶，以及護老者和殘疾人士照顧者的高風險住戶，並委託關愛隊接觸及探訪他們、表達關懷及提供適切支援。我們已於二○二五年九月將這項試點計劃由觀塘和沙田兩區擴展至全港18區。截至二○二五年十二月底，關愛隊在計劃下已接觸或探訪超過27000個高風險住戶，並作出超過1800次福利服務轉介，以及按需要協助他們申請平安鐘服務，當中部分申請包含於上述提及的2700個成功獲得資助安裝平安鐘服務的住戶。

另一個試點計劃是與提問（三）有關的數據庫。我們在二○二五年七‍月建立了首階段的支援照顧者數據平台，目的是為入院照顧者提供緊急支援，並協助照顧其家中的被照顧者。我們初步連結了社署、醫院管理局（醫管局）及房屋署的數據，而當社署從醫管局的通報機制得悉有關住戶的照顧者因入院而出現照顧風險時，會安排人員主動接觸被照顧者，按其需要提供緊急支援，例如暫託及送餐服務，務求及早介入。截至二○二五年十二月底，社署已聯絡超過3100宗照顧者個案，當中確認三宗個案需要即時緊急支援。至於其他個案，社署已提供社福單位聯繫方法，以便有需要時為被照顧者提供支援。

政府往後會將相關數據庫系統化，並逐步擴展覆蓋範圍，下一步目標是涵蓋居於香港房屋協會公屋單位及「三無大廈」的高風險住戶。"
LCQ2: Enhancing elderly support networks in the community,2026-02-04 12:52,2026-02-04 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400328.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Maggie Chan and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

  It has been reported that the Housing Department and the Social Welfare Department launched a pilot scheme in Kwun Tong and Sha Tin in July last year to assist District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams) in identifying and supporting singleton or doubleton elderly households more accurately by consolidating data from both departments. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the progress of the Care Teams' work of supporting elderly people in these two pilot districts since the commencement of the pilot scheme, including the number of indoor or wearable Emergency Alarm Systems (commonly known as ""ping on bell"") that have been provided with their assistance so far, and whether it has plans to introduce other gerontechnology products for use by elderly people and extend the pilot scheme to the 18 districts across the territory;

(2) whether the data consolidated under the pilot scheme include information such as family members of elderly people, health conditions of elderly people, their demand for community support and their situation of receiving government assistance; of the government department currently responsible for data analysis and coordination; and

(3) whether it will expeditiously establish a comprehensive ""singleton and doubleton elderly family"" database integrated with a comparative analysis of data from government departments and public bodies such as the Social Welfare Department, the Housing Department and the Hospital Authority, so as to better assist singleton and doubleton elderly families; if so, of the timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Government implements a variety of measures to provide subsidised community care and support services for elderly persons in need, including day care services for the elderly, home care and support services, and the Community Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly. At the same time, as carers play an important role in supporting elderly persons and persons with disabilities living in the community, the Government has spared no effort to strengthen support for carers of elderly persons and carers of persons with disabilities so as to alleviate their physical and mental stress, and enable care recipients to be looked after in a more comprehensive manner.

 I will now elaborate on the relevant policy measures, and provide a consolidated response to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Maggie Chan.

District Services and Community Care Teams – Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers

 With a view to identifying households of singleton and doubleton elderly persons, carers of elderly persons and carers of persons with disabilities in need, the Government launched the District Services and Community Care Teams – Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers (the Scheme) in March 2024 on a pilot basis in Tsuen Wan and Southern District, and extended the Scheme to all 18 districts of Hong Kong in April 2025. As at end-December 2025, more than 450 Care Teams across the territory had visited or contacted under the Scheme over 79000 households of singleton and doubleton elderly persons, carers of elderly persons and carers of persons with disabilities in need, provided them with care and support, and made service referrals. Among these households, more than 2700 of them successfully received subsidies for installation and service of the emergency alarm system (EAS).

Gerontechnology

  Meanwhile, the Government has been promoting wider application of gerontechnology and rehabilitation care technology in society. The Government allocated $1 billion in 2018 for setting up the Innovation and Technology Fund for Application in Elderly and Rehabilitation Care (I&T Fund) to subsidise eligible elderly and rehabilitation service units to procure, rent or trial use technology products, with a view to improving the quality of life of service users and reducing the burden and stress on care staff and carers. As I mentioned in my written reply to the Legislative Council two weeks ago, the Government injected an additional $1 billion into the I&T Fund in 2024-25, enabling eligible community elderly and rehabilitation service units to apply for the procurement of suitable technology products, so that elderly persons and their carers can borrow these products and use them at home, thereby extending the application of technology products for household use.

  As announced in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) will install, on a pilot basis, intelligent accident detection systems for 300 high-risk carer households, including households with elderly persons or persons with disabilities, this year to strengthen support to carers with a view to achieving real-time detection, early intervention and prompt assistance. We expect to announce the detailed arrangements in the first quarter of this year the earliest, and will strive to complete installation in or before the third quarter. Households participating in the pilot project will be exempted from all fees. We will commission a university to evaluate the effectiveness of this project, which will serve as a reference for continuous implementation of, and adjustments or improvements to the measure in future.

Carer Support Data Platform

  Regarding the Carer Support Data Platform, the LWB and the Social Welfare Department (SWD) launched two pilot schemes in July 2025. The first one, which is mentioned in Question (1), involves collaboration with the Housing Department (HD). This scheme aims to establish a community support network for high-risk groups which have yet to receive social welfare service support. By consolidating data from both departments, we have identified high-risk households comprising singleton or doubleton elderly persons that are relatively older and lack community support, as well as high-risk households of carers of elderly persons and carers of persons with disabilities. We have then deployed Care Teams to contact and visit these households, and provide them with care and suitable support. In September 2025, we extended this pilot scheme from Kwun Tong and Sha Tin to all 18 districts of Hong Kong. As at end-December 2025, Care Teams had contacted or visited over 27 000 high-risk households, made over 1 800 welfare service referrals, and assisted them in applying for EAS as needed under the scheme. Some of these applications were counted in the aforementioned 2 700 households which successfully received subsidies for installation and service of EAS.

  The other pilot scheme is relevant to the database mentioned in Question (3). We established the first phase of the Carer Support Data Platform in July 2025, with the objective to provide emergency support to hospitalised carers and assist them in looking after their care recipient at home. We have initially connected data from the SWD, the Hospital Authority (HA) and the HD for this purpose. When the SWD learns from HA's notification mechanism that a carer is hospitalised and hence the relevant household may be at care risk, the SWD will arrange staff to proactively contact the care recipient and provide emergency support tailored to their needs, such as respite services and meal delivery services, to achieve early intervention. As at end-December 2025, the SWD had contacted over 3 100 carer cases, with three cases identified as cases requiring immediate emergency support. For the remaining cases, the SWD provided them with contact details of social welfare units so that support for care recipients could be provided when needed.

  In future, the Government will systematise the relevant database and progressively expand its coverage, and the next target is to include high-risk households living in Hong Kong Housing Society public rental units and ""three-nil"" buildings."
立法會二十一題：向市民發緊急警示及重要資訊,2026-02-04 12:45,2026-02-04 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400345.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上黃錦輝議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於二○二○年推出緊急警示系統，以在極端天氣、重大公共安全和大型公共衞生事故等緊急情況下，通過流動網絡向流動服務用戶發出公告及訊息，從而讓公眾得以迅速採取應變措施。然而，自該系統啓用以來，只在二○二二年三月使用過一次。有意見認為，政府在過去一些極端天氣情況及重大社會事故發生時，應可更好地善用該系統以向市民作出預警。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見認為，去年十一月大埔宏福苑發生五級火警時，政府應使用該系統向市民作出警報，通知屋苑居民離開災場，並呼籲其他市民盡量避免在災場附近聚集，以免車流及人流影響救援工作，政府當時未有使用該系統發出訊息的原因為何；

（二）政府使用該系統的準則及流程為何，包括由哪個部門或職級的官員作最終審批；鑑於該系統有兩個警示級別（即「極度緊急警示」和「緊急警示」），該兩個警示級別的具體分級標準為何；

（三）如日後遇到區域性或局部性的突發緊急事件，該系統在技術上可否只局部向身處本港特定地區的市民發出訊息並作出警示；另外，當局會否進一步考慮使用「智方便」手機應用程式發放緊急警示；

（四）據悉內地一些地方政府轄下的部門，會不時通過手機短訊向市民發放有關惡劣天氣、節日防災、公共衞生、大型活動等資訊，當局會否考慮參考有關做法，更多地利用手機短訊及「智方便」手機應用程式向市民發放一些全港性的通知或資訊；及

（五）該系統每年的經常性開支及每次使用系統發出訊息的成本為何？

答覆：

主席：

就黃錦輝議員各部分的提問，經諮詢保安局、創新科技及工業局和環境及生態局後，我現回覆如下：

（一）設立緊急警示系統的目的，是讓政府各政策局／部門在發生嚴重緊急情況下，可透過流動網絡向全港流動服務用戶發送緊急警報，例如極端天氣所導致的廣泛基建破壞或故障、重大公共安全事故或大型公共衞生緊急情況。此系統一旦啓動，全港流動服務用戶均會強制收到流動裝置發出持續10秒的警報聲響和緊急訊息，由於目的是讓市民即時作出所需應變，保護自身安全，所以警報的啓動難免打擾市民當時正在進行的活動或工作，可能會引發廣泛關注。另一方面，如頻繁地使用緊急警示系統很有可能削弱市民對此系統的警覺性及危機意識。故此，各政策局／部門會謹慎衡量實際情況，以決定會否透過緊急警示系統，或使用其他通訊渠道向公眾發放重要資訊。

緊急警示系統的設計是向全港流動用戶發出警報，而大埔宏福苑火警屬於地區性事故，因而未有啓動緊急警示系統向全港流動服務用戶發送緊急警報。事實上，消防處於接獲報案後，已在五分鐘內迅速抵達現場。在消防車及警車到達火警現場的時候，相關車輛的警號聲已發揮即時警示作用，以提醒居民有火警發生。警務人員亦有使用警車及無人機上的廣播系統，呼籲市民即時疏散。同時，現場消防人員及警察亦即時協助受影響居民疏散，並帶領他們前往安全地點。此外，政府已透過新聞公報、電台及電視台即時和循環播出「大埔火警特別通知」，特別提醒附近居民宏福苑發生火災。

（二）緊急警示系統所發放的警示分為兩級，包括「緊急警示」用於呼籲市民採取行動以避免個人健康、安全或財產可能遭受的即時危險；及「極度緊急警示」用於要求市民就可能造成人命傷亡、嚴重人身傷害及大規模財物損失的明顯及即時危險作出即時的行動。根據機制，各政策局／部門在有充分理由的緊急情況下，在取得有關政策局局長的批准後（如屬「極度緊急警示」，則亦須取得政務司司長的批准），可透過緊急警示系統發送警示訊息，提醒市民迅速採取應變措施。

（三）及（四）緊急警示系統採用流動網路的區域廣播服務技術，技術上可支持在特定區域發放警示訊息。政府現正積極檢視及優化緊急警示系統的設置及應用，包括根據不同情況發出全港性或地區性緊急警報。緊急警示系統只是其中一種發放渠道，各政策局／部門會謹慎衡量實際情況，以決定是否透過緊急警示系統向身處本港某地區的市民發放針對性的警示訊息。

關於惡劣天氣的資訊，香港天文台（天文台）除了通過電視台和電台等渠道發放天氣資訊外，亦會通過天文台網站、「我的天文台」流動應用程式、以及天文台社交網站平台等向市民發放信息。另外，「智方便」流動應用程式設有政府資訊及提示發放功能，涵蓋多項與市民日常生活息息相關的內容，包括天氣警告及特別天氣提示、特別交通消息、外遊警示、食物安全警報等。用戶可按個人需要，通過設定選擇接收由各政府部門發放的資訊及提示。

（五）流動網絡營辦商根據現行的牌照要求，須自費維持及確保緊急警示系統持續運作，讓政府可在緊急情況下，透過其流動網絡向用戶發送緊急警示訊息。維持及運作緊急警示系統（包括使用系統發出訊息）不涉及政府額外的經常性開支。"
​立法會一題：展示大型建設項目的規劃以招商引資,2026-02-04 12:45,2026-02-04 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400389.htm,"​以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上嚴剛議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的答覆：

問題：

發展局曾計劃在灣仔興建「大型建設計劃展館」，以展示及介紹包括北部都會區（北都）等大型項目，但政府其後決定改為在不同新發展區的社區聯絡中心及網站上建立實體及網上展廳。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見認為，分散設立北都展覽造成資源浪費，而且不能產生規模效應，難以為北都招商引資，政府會否考慮將展館的選址集中在北都區域；如否，原因為何；

（二）會否考慮適度擴展河套科創築城館的規模，劃出專區展示北都發展藍圖，以減少重複投放資源，並以更聚焦的方式吸引公眾關注；及

（三）會否參考內地（例如上海浦東、廣州南沙及深圳前海等）在規劃展示館方面的成功經驗，整合人工智能虛擬實境、全息投影、三維多媒體、互動沙盤等成本不高的技術，營造全景式沉浸式體驗，以形象化及動態地展示大型項目的建設成果，從而提升招商引資的成效？

答覆：

主席：

北部都會區（北都）是香港未來經濟發展的重要引擎，隨着北都的基本規劃均已出台，土地陸續產出，北都發展已進入新階段，重點工作之一是引進企業參與建設及促成產業進駐，同時要為推動北都發展凝聚社會共識。

就嚴剛議員各部分的提問，我回覆如下：

（一）及（二）設立與北都相關的展館，的確有助達到兩大目標。第一，是讓社會了解並支持北都作為香港戰略增長區的發展。第二，是招商引資，集中展示北都的潛力，以推動企業參與建設，並吸引企業落戶，推動產業集聚。

我們較早前經初步探討，曾經提出在灣仔北海濱用地建設展館，展示包括北都在內的大型基建。在聽取社會和立法會的意見，並考慮工作及資源調配的優次後，我們認為現階段並非適合時機推展有關項目。事實上，有關項目的落實需時較長，未能配合北都此刻招商引資的迫切需要。

若純粹為向市民大眾介紹北都，政府近年已在中環展城館設置北都專區展覽。若是為了招商引資的目標，根據我們的經驗，有興趣探討參與北都發展的企業往往希望近距離了解北都的最新進展並進行實地考察。現時，政府已在北都一些新發展區包括古洞北、粉嶺北、洪水橋和河套設置社區聯絡中心。分別於二○二三年和二○二四年啓用的粉嶺北和河套社區聯絡中心都有加入展覽設施介紹相關新發展區的規劃和工程，成為北都首兩個「地區展館」，而當中粉嶺北社區聯絡中心的展覽內容更涵蓋整個北都規劃和發展。按此方向，即將在今年第一季左右完成搬遷及擴建的洪水橋社區聯絡中心，亦將會加入介紹洪水橋／厦村新發展區及北都整體規劃及發展的展覽設施。經驗顯示，這些「地區展館」能更有效配合實地考察工作，向訪客具體地展示當區發展成果，更好聚焦目前招商引資的工作。

展望未來，我們會考慮擴大河套科創築城館的展示內容，以涵蓋毗鄰新田科技城、馬草壟，以至整個北都的發展。此外，我們計劃在古洞北新發展區設立一個較大型、「一館多用」的北都核心展廳，並爭取於二○二七年內啓用首階段，取代目前同樣位於古洞北新發展區但規模較小的社區聯絡中心。這個新的北都核心展廳選址古洞北，原因是其鄰近即將於二○二七年啓用的東鐵線古洞站，交通便利；展廳位置亦鄰近政府已決定在古洞北落戶的國家發展成就館，日後可發展成展館建築群，而塱原自然生態公園亦在毗鄰，參觀展廳的人士可以順道遊覽該公園，了解北都「發展與保育並行」的理念和成果。

除上述實體展廳外，我們亦會在北都專屬網站上建立網上展廳，透過多媒體向海內外人士介紹北都。

（三）我們同意要吸引訪客，提升招商引資成效，不單要有豐富的展示內容，亦須重視策展方式。就此，我們會持續參考內地和其他地方的展館，以訪客視角規劃，並採用多媒體、科技展示方式。以粉嶺北社區聯絡中心為例，它設有全息投影和立體模型，以立體方式展示新發展區全貌；另有沉浸式體驗，以影像投射建構虛擬實境，讓參與者感受「飛越」粉嶺北新發展區；也有模擬駕駛遊戲，讓訪客可以透過多元形式了解及體驗相關新發展區以至整個北都的發展。

未來計劃在古洞北設置的北都核心展廳，將採用更多創新科技，打造全景式互動平台，多媒體展示、多角度彰顯北都作為香港未來發展的新引擎，讓市民更直觀了解規劃藍圖，投資者更具體認識北都的發展潛力。"
LCQ21: Issuance of emergency alerts and important information to public,2026-02-04 12:45,2026-02-04 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400346.htm," Following is a question by Professor the Hon William Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

 The Government launched the Emergency Alert System in 2020 to disseminate public announcements and messages to mobile service users via mobile networks during emergency situations such as extreme weather, major public safety incidents and large-scale public health incidents, thereby enabling the public to take swift contingency measures. However, since its commissioning, the System has only been utilised once in March 2022. There are views that in the past, when extreme weather events and major social incidents occurred, the Government could have made better use of the System to issue early warnings to members of the public. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given the view that when a No.5 alarm fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po in November last year, the Government should have used the System to issue an alert to the public to notify residents of the housing court concerned to evacuate the scene of the fire and to appeal to other members of the public to avoid gathering nearby, thus preventing vehicular and pedestrian traffic from impeding rescue operations, of the reasons for the Government not using the System to disseminate such messages at that time;

(2) of the criteria and procedures for the Government's use of the System, including the department or rank of officials responsible for giving final approval; given that the System has two alert levels (i.e. ""Emergency Alert"" and ""Extreme Emergency Alert""), the specific classification standards for these two alert levels;

(3) whether, in the event of a regional or localised sudden emergency incident in the future, the System is technically capable of partially issuing messages and alerts only to members of the public located in specific areas of Hong Kong; whether the authorities will further consider using the ""iAM Smart"" mobile application to disseminate emergency alerts;

(4) it is learnt that certain departments under local governments in the Mainland occasionally disseminate information to members of the public via mobile phone SMS messages on matters such as inclement weather, disaster prevention during festive periods, public health and major events, whether the authorities will consider drawing reference from such practices and making greater use of mobile phone SMS messages and the ""iAM Smart"" mobile application to disseminate territory-wide notifications or information to members of the public; and

(5) of the annual recurrent expenditure of the System, and the cost incurred each time it is used to issue messages?

Reply:

President,

 In response to various parts of the question raised by Professor the Hon William Wong, having consulted the Security Bureau, the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, and the Environment and Ecology Bureau, our reply is as follows:

(1) The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is established to enable government bureaux and departments to send emergency alerts to all mobile service users in Hong Kong via mobile networks in the event of serious emergency situations, such as extensive infrastructure damages or failures caused by extreme weather, significant public safety incidents, or major public health emergency situations. Once the EAS is activated, all mobile service users in Hong Kong will receive on their devices a mandatory alert tone lasting 10 seconds together with the emergency message. Since the objective of the EAS is to prompt members of the public to take immediate responsive actions to safeguard their personal safety, the activation of the EAS will inevitably interrupt their activities or work at that moment and may attract widespread public attention. On the other hand, frequent activation of the EAS may result in reducing vigilance and crisis awareness of citizens regarding the EAS messages. Therefore, government bureaux and departments will carefully evaluate the actual circumstances so as to decide whether to release important information through the EAS or through other communication channels.

 The EAS is designed to issue alerts to all mobile users in Hong Kong. As the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po was a district-level incident, the EAS was not activated to send emergency alerts to all mobile service users in Hong Kong. As a matter of fact, the Fire Services Department arrived at the scene within five minutes after receiving the report. With fire engines and police vehicles having arrived at the scene, the sirens on these vehicles served as an immediate alert of the fire to residents. Police officers also made use of the public address systems installed on police vehicles and drones to urge members of the public to evacuate immediately. Firefighters and police officers at the scene also offered immediate assistance to affected residents in evacuating and led them to safe locations. In addition, the Government issued a ""special announcement on fire in Tai Po"" through press releases, immediate and repeated broadcasts on radio and television channels, in particular to remind nearby residents of the fire at Wang Fuk Court.

(2) Alerts under the EAS are classified into two levels, namely the ""Emergency Alert"" calling for citizens' actions to avoid immediate risks to their personal health, safety or properties; and the ""Extreme Emergency Alert"" requiring citizens' immediate actions in response to obvious and imminent danger that could cause the loss of human lives, serious personal injuries and massive damage to properties. According to the established mechanism, under truly justified emergency situations, government bureaux and departments may, after obtaining the approval of the relevant Director of Bureau (and the Chief Secretary for Administration in the case of ""Extreme Emergency Alert""), disseminate EAS messages to alert members of the public to take immediate responsive actions.

(3) and (4) The EAS deploys cell broadcast service technology of mobile networks. Technically, it can support dissemination of EAS messages to specific district(s). The Government has been actively reviewing and enhancing the configuration and application of the EAS, including the issuance of territory-wide or district-specific emergency alerts according to different circumstances. The EAS is only one of the dissemination channels, government bureaux and departments will carefully assess the actual circumstances to determine whether to disseminate emergency messages to the targeted public located in specific areas in Hong Kong through the EAS.

 Regarding information on adverse weather conditions, the Hong Kong Observatory disseminates weather updates not only through television and radio broadcasts but also via its official website, the ""MyObservatory"" mobile app, and its social media platforms, etc. Besides, the ""iAM Smart"" mobile app provides a function for disseminating government information and alerts, covering a wide range of contents closely related to citizens' daily lives, including weather warnings and special weather tips, special traffic news, outbound travel alerts, food safety alerts, etc. Users may select through customised settings to receive information and alerts issued by various government departments based on their personal needs.

(5) Mobile network operators shall, pursuant to the prevailing licence requirements, maintain and operate the EAS at their own costs and ensure the continued availability of the EAS so as to enable the Government to disseminate EAS messages through their mobile networks to alert their users during emergency situations. The maintenance and operation of the EAS (including using the system to issue messages) does not involve any additional government recurrent expenditure."
立法會九題：吸引旅客在港消費,2026-02-04 12:37,2026-02-04 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400276.htm,"​以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上陳振英議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見指出，旅客消費對地區零售經濟的發展至關重要。關於吸引旅客在港消費，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於內地早前進一步放寬境外旅客入境條件與便利旅客消費的政策（包括將境外旅客購物離境退稅「即買即退」服務措施推廣至全國），大幅提升其國際旅遊吸引力，而有意見認為香港是不少旅客進入內地的首選「中轉站」，當局將如何把握機遇，推動經香港中轉的旅客預留更多時間在港消費；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，去年在港舉辦的巴塞爾藝術展香港展會及上映的電影《九龍城寨之圍城》均獲觀眾好評，充分展現香港豐富的文化、歷史及藝術資源，當局會否進一步發掘該等資源以延長旅客的留港時間並增加其消費誘因；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見指出，高層次論壇及國際展覽所帶來的商務旅客的人均消費水平普遍較高，對經濟的貢獻顯著，當局將採取哪些措施進一步吸引該等活動在港舉辦；有否計劃整合各類盛事或活動，以促進商務旅客的消費？

答覆：

主席：

旅遊業是香港經濟的重要支柱之一，帶動零售、餐飲、酒店等行業發展。政府一直積極把握機遇，推動文化、體育與旅遊深度融合，致力為旅客提供多姿多彩的旅遊體驗，提升香港整體吸引力，為本地經濟注入新動力。

旅遊業在二○二五年表現出色，全年共錄得4 990萬人次旅客，高於年初的估計，亦較二○二四年全年的4 450萬人次增加12%。其中，中央多項惠港挺港措施為香港旅遊業注入龐大動力，全年訪港內地旅客共約有3 780萬人次，較二○二四年增加約11%。非內地旅客則共約有1 210萬人次，按年大幅增長15%。

就陳振英議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局、運輸及物流局和財經事務及庫務局後，現答覆如下：

（一）香港特別行政區政府（政府）於二○二五年十月起擴大豁免繳付飛機乘客離境稅的乘客範圍，涵蓋更多經水路和陸路來港轉機和於抵港下一日於機場乘搭飛機離境的乘客，以吸引更多乘客使用香港國際機場轉機，進一步鞏固香港作為國際航空樞紐的地位。香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）及旅遊業界已大力向內地及國際旅客推廣這項新措施，以吸引更多經香港中轉的旅客在港消費。

此外，中央於二○二五年十一月把四個連接香港的口岸，包括廣州琶洲客運港、港珠澳大橋、中山港及廣深港高鐵西九龍站，納入為外國人240小時過境免簽政策的入境口岸，有助吸引更多海外旅客先入境香港，再通過香港與內地之間的完善跨境網絡，進入內地進行「一程多站」旅遊。

另外，香港國際機場於二○二五年九月推出專為航空轉機旅客而設的免費本地遊服務，讓中轉時間較長的旅客在中轉逗留期間，離開機場到香港不同地方觀光和消費。參加者在香港國際機場可使用專屬的抵港及離港快速通關服務，順暢進出禁區及依時登機，更好利用中轉時間體驗香港獨有文化，遊覽特色景點。

文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）及相關政策局／部門會繼續與香港機場管理局、旅發局、航空公司及旅遊業界積極探討更多能吸引經香港中轉的旅客預留更多時間在香港觀光和消費的措施。

（二）香港擁有豐富文化、歷史及藝術等不同旅遊資源，我們正與相關政策局及部門，以及不同持份者合作，打造豐富多元、具香港特色的旅遊體驗。文體旅局及旅發局會透過不同文化節慶、旅遊項目及盛事組合，推動「盛事＋旅遊」發展，吸引旅客加長留港時間並加強重訪意欲。

我們在二○二五年為旅客及市民提供多個文化和體育的國際級盛事，包括首次在啟德體育園舉行的香港國際七人欖球賽、「LIV Golf香港站」、巴塞爾藝術展、Art Central、ComplexCon、香港足球盛會2025、第十五屆全國運動會及全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會、外地組合及本地歌星演唱會、以著名IP（知識產權）為主題的「維港海上大巡遊」，以及「Merry Balloon Hong Kong」大型氣球巡遊等。旅發局亦主辦旗艦盛事，包括香港國際龍舟邀請賽、香港美酒佳餚巡禮、香港繽紛冬日巡禮、香港跨年倒數及新春國際匯演之夜。其中，香港繽紛冬日巡禮在二○二五年移師至中環鬧市，帶出濃厚冬日節慶氛圍。展望將來，我們將繼續籌辦及支持這些大型文化及體育盛事，進一步鞏固香港作為亞洲盛事之都的地位。

此外，我們也會把握港產電影熱潮的契機，結合影視文化元素推廣主題旅遊，吸引旅客深入探索香港的多元魅力。自二○二五年五月二十四日起開放給公眾參觀的《九龍城寨光影之旅》電影場景展，廣受市民及旅客歡迎，至今已有超過291 000人次到場參觀，當中有不少旅客是專程來港參觀。我們亦於二○二六年一月二日開放在舊油麻地警署內設置的《油蔴地警署光影之旅》展覽，展覽以香港警匪片為主題，項目自推出以來，反應熱烈，一月的一萬一千多張入場劵在兩星期內已售罄。我們將於農曆新年期間延長開放時間，以便訪港旅客及市民參觀。文創產業發展處亦將為展覽建立品牌商標，並開發融合警匪片元素、舊警署建築特色及油麻地地區文化的文創產品，透過文創產品與展覽的深度結合，豐富香港文化及旅遊體驗，同時帶動地區經濟。

我們也積極推展「香港製造」工業元素相關的旅遊產品，並在二○二五年九月推出第一階段的香港工業品牌旅遊計劃，涵蓋位於大埔創新園內的三個工業品牌，包括李錦記、奇華及益力多。這些品牌不僅展現各自獨特的故事，還安排旅客參觀產品製作過程、試食或工作坊等體驗活動，讓旅客了解香港的工業歷史與成就。我們現正與其他工業品牌商討下一階段的項目。

此外，旅發局也善用香港的美食文化，聯同中華廚藝學院，於上月推出「香港好味」名廚精選美食指南，邀請超過50位畢業自中華廚藝學院的本地名廚推薦全港250間心水餐廳，啓發旅客覓食靈感，提升旅遊吸引力。

（三）香港作為全球第七大商品貿易經濟體系，亦是區內重要的會議和展覽（會展）樞紐，不少國際知名的組織及商業機構都選擇在香港舉辦會展活動。會展項目，尤其是國際性活動，吸引眾多參加者（包括參展商和買家）來港，不單令會展業界受惠，其帶來的高消費商務旅客亦帶動住宿、餐飲、零售、娛樂等其他行業的經濟活動，令多個行業受益，為香港經濟帶來重大貢獻。

考慮到會展活動對香港經濟的貢獻，政府撥款14億元於二○二三年七月推出「定期展覽獎勵計劃」，資助私人主辦單位舉辦的合資格本地和國際性展覽的場地租金。計劃已於二○二五年六月三十日結束，反應非常理想，合共批出超過12億元，共支援224場合資格展覽。為進一步推動會展業和盛事經濟的發展，從而為香港創造整體經濟效益，政府再撥款五億元於二○二五年七月一日推出「定期展覽獎勵計劃2.0」，聚焦支持新設及定期的大型國際性展覽。此外，政府會繼續推進擴建大型會展設施的計劃，提供額外場地供更多會展活動在港舉行。其中，亞洲國際博覽館（亞博館）的擴建工程已展開，項目預計在二○二八年落成。

除此以外，旅發局會繼續透過不同資助計劃，主動積極競投或協助競投，支持大型國際會議選址香港舉行，重點爭取金融服務、醫療科學、資訊科技、航空物流等國際交流會議，例如世界癌症大會、Consensus Hong Kong等。旅發局亦會加強香港國際會議大使計劃，透過商界及專業團體傑出領袖，協助物色和游說國際會展活動落戶香港。在會議和獎勵旅遊方面，旅發局會積極吸引更多企業會議和獎勵旅遊活動來港舉辦，並針對拓展內地、東南亞及印度市場，爭取大型直銷公司來港舉辦大型會議及獎勵旅遊活動。旅發局更與國際品牌合作，支持他們將知名的活動帶到香港，例如，旅發局與「50最佳」品牌達成合作夥伴計劃，於二○二四年和二○二五年在香港分別舉行「亞洲50最佳酒吧」和「世界50最佳酒吧」頒獎典禮，並於今年三月在香港舉行2026「亞洲50最佳餐廳」頒獎典禮。旅發局亦會預早向會展活動主辦單位介紹不同月份的盛事活動和季節的主題活動，以便他們的籌備推廣，促進商務旅客的消費。

LCQ9: Attracting visitors to spend in Hong Kong,2026-02-04 12:37,2026-02-04 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400277.htm,"​Following is a question by the Hon Chan Chun-ying and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

There are views pointing out that visitor spending is crucial to the development of local retail economy. Regarding attracting visitors to spend in Hong Kong, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Mainland has earlier on further relaxed the entry conditions for visitors from abroad and policies to facilitate visitor spending (including extending the ""refund-upon-purchase"" services for visitors from abroad to the whole country), significantly enhancing its international tourism appeal, and as there are views that Hong Kong serves as the premier ""transit point"" for many visitors entering the Mainland, how the authorities will seize this opportunity to promote visitors transiting via Hong Kong to allocate more time for spending in Hong Kong;

(2) as there are views that the Art Basel Hong Kong held in Hong Kong last year and the film ""Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In"" were acclaimed by audiences, fully showcasing Hong Kong's rich cultural, historical and artistic resources, whether the authorities will further explore such resources to extend visitors' stay in Hong Kong and increase their incentive to spend; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views pointing out that high-level forums and international exhibitions generally attract business visitors with higher per capita spending levels, making significant contributions to the economy, of the measures to be adopted by the authorities to further attract such activities to be held in Hong Kong; whether it has plans to integrate various types of mega events or activities to promote spending by business visitors?

Reply:

President,

Tourism is one of the important pillars of Hong Kong's economy, driving the development of retail, catering and hotel industries. The Government has been actively seizing the opportunity to promote the in-depth integration of culture, sports and tourism, and is committed to providing visitors with enjoyable travel experiences, enhancing Hong Kong's overall attractiveness, and injecting impetus into the local economy.

The tourism industry performed very well in 2025. In 2025, there were 49.9 million visitor arrivals, exceeding the estimate made early in the year and marking a 12 per cent growth compared with the whole-year total of 44.5 million in 2024. The Central Government's numerous measures benefitting Hong Kong have injected tremendous momentum into Hong Kong's tourism industry, with around 37.8 million Mainland visitor arrivals recorded in the year, representing an increase of around 11 per cent compared to 2024. Meanwhile, there were around 12.1 million non-Mainland visitor arrivals, reflecting a robust growth of 15 per cent year-on-year.

In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Chun-ying is as follows:

(1) Starting from October 2025, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the Government) has expanded the scope of passengers exempted from paying the air passenger departure tax, covering more transfer passengers arriving by sea or land and passengers departing by air from the airport on the next day of arrival. This initiative aims to attract more passengers to use Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) for transfer, thereby further consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub. The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) and the tourism sector have actively promoted this new initiative to the Chinese Mainland and international visitors with a view to attracting more transfer passengers' spending in Hong Kong.

Moreover, in November 2025, the Central Government incorporated four ports connecting Hong Kong, including the Guangzhou Pazhou Ferry Terminal, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, the Zhongshan Port, and the West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link as entry ports into the 240-hour visa-free transit policy for foreign nationals. This arrangement is beneficial to attract more international visitors to take Hong Kong as their first stop, and then embark on multi-destination travel itineraries in the Chinese Mainland via the comprehensive cross-boundary network between Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland.

Separately, HKIA launched a free local tour service designed exclusively for transfer passengers in September2025, allowing those passengers with longer layovers to leave the airport and visit and spend in different areas in Hong Kong during their transit stay. Tour participants can enjoy exclusive fast-track immigration clearance upon their arrival and departure at HKIA, ensuring smooth access into and out of the restricted areas and timely boarding. This enables the participants to better utilise their transit time to experience Hong Kong's unique culture and explore its distinctive attractions.

The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) and relevant policy bureaux/departments (b/ds) will continue to work with the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the HKTB, airlines and the travel trade to proactively explore more measures that can attract visitors transiting via Hong Kong to allocate more time for sightseeing and spending in Hong Kong.

(2) Hong Kong is rich in cultural, historical and artistic tourism resources. We are working with relevant b/ds, as well as various stakeholders, to develop diverse travel experiences with Hong Kong's local characteristics. The CSTB and the HKTB will promote the development of ""Mega Events + Tourism"" through diverse cultural festivals, tourism projects and mega events so as to encourage visitors to extend their stay in Hong Kong and enhance their desire to revisit the city.

In 2025, we delivered visitors and the public a number of major international cultural and sports events, including the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament, which was staged at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time, LIV Golf Hong Kong, Art Basel, Art Central, ComplexCon, Hong Kong Football Festival 2025, the 15th National Games of the People's Republic of China, the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games, concerts of groups from other places and local singers, ""Water Parade at Victoria Harbour"" featuring renowned Ips (intellectual property) and the large-scale balloon parade ""Merry Balloon Hong Kong"". The HKTB also organised flagship events, including Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races, Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival, Hong Kong WinterFest, Hong Kong New Year Countdown and International Chinese New Year Night Parade. Among the events, the Hong Kong WinterFest was moved to Central in 2025 to create a vibrant winter festive ambience. Looking ahead, we will continue to organise and support these mega cultural and sports events to further reinforce Hong Kong's position as the Events Capital of Asia.

Besides, we will seize the opportunity from the enthusiasm for Hong Kong films to promote thematic tourism incorporating film and television cultural elements, encouraging visitors to explore the city's diverse charms. Opened to the public since May 24, 2025, the ""Kowloon Walled City: A Cinematic Journey"" Movie Set Exhibition has been well received by locals and visitors, with more than 291 000 visitors to date, many of whom travelled to Hong Kong specifically for this exhibition. We have also opened the ""Yau Ma Tei Police Station: A Cinematic Journey"" Exhibition at the Old Yau Ma Tei Police Station on January 2, 2026, which is themed around Hong Kong police and crime films. Public response for this exhibition has been overwhelming, with over 11 000 tickets for January sold out within two weeks. To facilitate visits by visitors and citizens, we will extend the opening hours during Chinese New Year period. The Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency will also establish a dedicated brand trademark for the exhibition and develop a range of cultural and creative products integrating elements of Hong Kong police and crime films, the architectural features of the historic police station, and the local culture of the Yau Ma Tei district. By seamlessly integrating these products into the exhibition, it will enrich the visitors' cultural and travel experiences while fostering economic activities within the district.

We are also actively promoting tourism products featuring ""Made in Hong Kong"" industrial element. The first phase of the Hong Kong industrial brand tourism scheme comprising three industrial brands within the Tai Po InnoPark, including Lee Kum Kee, Kee Wah and Yakult was launched in September 2025. These brands not only showcase their unique stories but also arrange experiential activities for visitors, such as tours of production processes, tastings or workshops, allowing visitors to understand Hong Kong's industrial history and achievements. We are currently discussing with other industrial brands with a view to launching the next phase of projects.

In addition, the HKTB also took the advantage of the local food culture and launched the ""Taste Hong Kong"" Gourmet Guide, in partnership with the Chinese Culinary Institute (CCI). The guide provided visitors with inspirations to explore the city's flavours and enhanced tourism appeal by inviting over 50 local master chefs who graduated from the CCI to recommend 250 of their favourite restaurants across Hong Kong.

(3) Hong Kong is the world's seventh-largest trading entity in merchandise trade and also the region's premier convention and exhibition (C&E) hub. Many well-known international organisations and businesses have chosen to host C&E events in Hong Kong. C&E events, in particular international ones, attract numerous participants (including exhibitors and buyers) to Hong Kong. In addition to benefitting the C&E industry, the high-spending business visitors they bring in also drive economic activities in related sectors, such as accommodation, catering, retail, entertainment, thereby benefitting various industries and bringing important contributions to Hong Kong's economy.

In view of the contribution of C&E events to Hong Kong's economy, the Government has allocated $1.4 billion to launch the Incentive Scheme for Recurrent Exhibitions (ISRE) in July 2023, subsidising venue rentals of eligible local and international exhibitions organised by private organisers. The ISRE ended on June 30, 2025 and was very well received, with over $1.2 billion approved to support 224 eligible exhibitions. To further promote the development of the C&E industry and the mega event economy in order to generate overall economic benefits for Hong Kong, the Government has allocated an additional provision of $500 million to launch the ISRE 2.0 on July1, 2025, focusing on attracting new and recurrent international exhibitions of a large scale. In addition, the Government will continue to take forward expansion projects for large-scale C&E facilities to provide additional space for more C&E events to be staged in Hong Kong. This includes the expansion project at the AsiaWorld-Expo, which has commenced construction and is expected to be completed in 2028.

In addition, the HKTB will continue to proactively bid or assist in bidding for major international conferences to be held in Hong Kong through various funding schemes, targeting, in particular, sectors such as financial services, medical science, information technology and aviation logistics. These include events such as the World Cancer Congress and Consensus Hong Kong. The HKTB will also continue to enhance the Hong Kong Convention Ambassador Programme, leveraging elite leaders from various business and professional sectors to identify and lobby international C&E events to be hosted Hong Kong. In terms of meetings and incentive travel, the HKTB will proactively focus on attracting more corporate meetings and incentive travel groups to Hong Kong. The HKTB will focus on markets such as the Chinese Mainland, Southeast Asia and India, while attracting large-scale direct sales corporates to host large-scale conventions and incentive travel activities in Hong Kong. The HKTB also collaborates with international brands to support them in bringing renowned events to Hong Kong. For example, the HKTB sealed a partnership with ""50 Best"", and the award ceremonies of ""Asia's 50 Best Bars"" and ""World's 50 Best Bars"" were held in Hong Kong in 2024 and 2025 respectively. In March 2026, the award ceremony of ""Asia's 50 Best Restaurants"" 2026 will also be held in Hong Kong. Besides, the HKTB will introduce event organisers of meetings, incentive travels and conventions and exhibitions (MICE) in advance to mega events and seasonal themed activities in different months, with a view to facilitating their pre-event planning, thereby boosting business visitor spending.

In 2025, Hong Kong welcomed 2.51 million MICE visitors, increasing by 7 per cent compared to last year. Among them, 1.43 million were overnight visitors, generating a total spending of about $10.7 billion. Throughout the year, more than 360 MICE events were staged in Hong Kong's two major dedicated MICE venues, namely the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and the AsiaWorld-Expo.

The Government will continue to secure and support the staging of international MICE events of different scales and types in Hong Kong, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international MICE capital. It will also work with the trade to enhance the travel experience of business visitors, with a view to attracting more high-value-added overnight visitors."
立法會三題：寄養服務,2026-02-04 12:30,2026-02-04 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400307.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上管浩鳴議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

據悉近年寄養家庭數目持續減少，令有需要的兒童難以獲得配對。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否考慮檢討寄養家庭的替假機制，包括在合理替假期內不扣減津貼，以及建立區域性的替假支援網絡，例如設立「夥伴家庭」機制，讓寄養家庭在有需要時可互相協助短暫照顧寄養兒童；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（二）會否考慮制訂與通脹率掛鈎的寄養兒童生活開支津貼和寄養家庭獎勵金，並提高有關金額，以涵蓋寄養兒童合理的學習和發展活動開支（例如補習費），並肯定寄養家長的無私付出；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為社會對寄養家庭的認同感不足，為了表揚寄養家庭的付出和推動建設寄養家庭友善社會，政府會否鼓勵商界推出「寄養友善卡」，為寄養家長提供交通、購物及文娛康樂服務等優惠；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

由社會福利署（社署）資助的兒童住宿照顧服務分為院舍服務及非院舍服務兩類，提供24小時免費住宿照顧，為因各種原因而暫時未能得到家人適當照顧的兒童及青少年提供過渡性的住宿照顧和保護。寄養服務屬於非院舍服務，為18歲以下因家庭問題或緊急事故而未能得到家人適切照顧的兒童提供過渡性的家庭式住宿照顧服務，讓他們能享受家庭生活，直至與家人團聚或達成長遠福利安排。

就管浩鳴議員三個部分的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

為使有需要的兒童獲得合適的照顧及鼓勵合適的家庭參與寄養服務，社署定期向寄養家長發放服務津貼和獎勵金，包括寄養兒童生活津貼及寄養家長服務獎勵金，同時亦向照顧有特殊需要或六歲以下兒童的寄養家庭提供額外獎勵金。另外，當兒童獲安排入住寄養家庭，該寄養家長亦會獲發一次性的初次入住津貼。有關津貼和獎勵金每年均會按綜合消費物價指數調整。

寄養兒童生活津貼供寄養家長用以支付寄養兒童每月的生活開支，包括伙食及日常用品等。根據現行機制，若寄養兒童經個案社工安排暫時離開寄養家庭回家留宿度假，寄養家長服務獎勵金及額外獎勵金均會繼續如常發放予寄養家長而不會扣減，寄養兒童生活津貼則會按兒童暫時離開寄養家庭的日數相應扣減。

如寄養家長因不同原因需請假而無法照顧寄養兒童，該名兒童會獲安排到其他寄養家庭接受照顧。在替假照顧安排期間，寄養服務津貼會發放予提供替假服務照顧該名兒童的寄養家庭，直至寄養兒童返回原來的寄養家庭生活。

為了完善替假照顧安排，社署於二○二四年一月推行「1+1」組合形式招募寄養家庭，讓有志加入寄養服務的家長及其親友一同申請加入服務，為同一名寄養兒童提供照顧。在一方因事暫未能安排照顧時，由另一方迅速接替，發揮互相支援的作用，讓寄養兒童無需被安排到陌生的環境居住。

為進一步加強支援寄養服務，政府近年推出一系列優化措施，包括於二○二四年四月起大幅調高寄養家長服務獎勵金，鼓勵有意參與人士成為寄養家庭。普通照顧的獎勵金由每月約5,000元增加超過一倍至約11,000元，緊急照顧的獎勵金則由每月約6,600元增加一倍至約13,000元。過去三年，登記成為寄養家庭的數目已由二○二三至二四‍年度的978個，增加至二○二五至二六年度（截至二○二五年底）的1 112個，升幅約14%。

此外，政府由二○二五年一月起增撥資源以加強支援寄養家長及提升服務質素，包括增加非政府機構的社工人手，為寄養家長提供訓練及專業支援；為有特殊學習或照顧需要的寄養兒童提供額外支援，及早安排評估及合適的專業康復治療和訓練：以及為有需要的寄養兒童提供額外津貼以應付課餘活動、補習班或興趣班等的開支，從而滿足他們在學習和成長方面的需要。

為表揚寄養家庭的付出和推動建設寄養家庭友善社會，社署每年舉行寄養家庭親子活動，寄養兒童可藉此機會向寄養家長表達謝意。社署亦定期舉行寄養家庭服務獎頒獎典禮，向寄養家庭頒發獎項，表揚他們對寄養兒童的關懷付出和非凡貢獻，同時鼓勵更多有心人加入寄養服務，將關愛傳送至更多有需要的兒童。此外，社署一直與提供寄養服務的非政府機構合作，藉不同渠道及傳播媒體作多方位宣傳，包括邀請寄養家長於媒體平台分享照顧寄養兒童的生活點滴，從而肯定寄養家長對照顧兒童的付出和貢獻，並提升公眾人士對寄養服務的認識。

社署會持續檢視寄養服務的使用情況，並與提供寄養服務的非政府機構保持溝通，以確保服務能配合及保障寄養兒童的需要和福祉。"
LCQ 3: Foster care service,2026-02-04 12:30,2026-02-04 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400318.htm,"Following is a question by Reverend Canon the Hon Peter Douglas Koon and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

It is learnt that the number of foster families has continued to decrease in recent years, making it difficult to find matches for children in need. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will consider reviewing the substitute mechanism for foster families, including not deducting allowances during reasonable substitute periods and establishing district-based substitute support networks, such as setting up a ""partner family"" mechanism to enable foster families to assist each other in providing short-term care for foster children when necessary; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it will consider formulating an inflation-linked foster care allowance for maintenance of foster children's expenses and an incentive payment for foster families, and increasing these amounts to cover foster children's reasonable expenses on learning and development activities (e.g. tutorial fees), as well as recognising the selfless contributions of foster parents; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that community recognition for foster families is insufficient, whether, in order to commend the contributions of foster families and promote the building of a foster family-friendly society, the Government will encourage the business sector to launch a ""Foster-Friendly Card"" to provide foster parents with concessions on transport, shopping, and arts, cultural, leisure and recreational services, etc.; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Residential Child Care Services subsidised by the Social Welfare Department (SWD) can be categorised into institutional and non-institutional services, which provide 24-hour free-of-charge transitional residential care and protection for children and young persons who temporarily cannot be adequately cared for by their families due to various reasons. Foster care is a type of non-institutional service for children under the age of 18 who cannot be adequately cared for by their families due to various family issues or emergencies, so that they can continue to enjoy family life until they can reunite with their families or a long-term alternative welfare arrangement is reached.

The consolidated reply to the three parts of the question raised by the Reverend Canon the Hon Peter Douglas Koon is as follows:

To ensure children in need receive appropriate care and to encourage suitable families to join foster care service, the SWD regularly disburses allowances and incentive payment to foster parents, including Maintenance Grant for Foster Children and Incentive Payment for Foster Parents. At the same time, an additional incentive payment is also provided to foster families taking care of children with special needs or children under six years old. Furthermore, when a child is placed in a foster family, the foster parents will receive a one-off setting-up grant. These allowances and payments are adjusted annually according to the Composite Consumer Price Index.

Maintenance Grant for Foster Children is provided for foster parents to cover the foster children's monthly living expenses, including food and daily necessities. According to the existing mechanism, if a foster child is arranged by the responsible caseworker to temporarily leave the foster home for home leave, the Incentive Payment for Foster Parentsand the additional incentive payment will continue to be disbursed to the foster parents without deduction, while the Maintenance Grant for Foster Children will be deducted according to the number of days the child is temporarily away from the foster home.

If foster parents need to take leave for various reasons and cannot take care of their foster child, the foster child will be arranged to receive care service at another foster home. During the relief care arrangement period, foster care allowance will be disbursed to the foster family providing relief care to the foster child concerned until the foster child returns to the original foster family.

To improve the arrangement of relief care, the SWD launched a ""one-plus-one"" recruitment scheme in January 2024 to encourage members of the public who are interested in providing foster care services to submit applications together with their relatives and friends for taking care of the same foster child, so that they can swiftly stand in for one another when one party is temporarily unable to provide care. The ""one-plus-one"" scheme facilitates mutual support between the shared households and also saves the need for a foster child to be arranged to stay in an unfamiliar living environment.

To further strengthen support for foster care services, the Government has implemented a series of enhancement measures recent years, including substantially increasing the incentive payment for foster parents starting from April 2024 to encourage interested parties to become foster families. The monthly incentive payment of ordinary foster care service has been increased more than double from around $5,000 to about $11,000; and that for emergency foster care service has been doubled from around $6,600 to about $13,000. In the past three years, the number of registered foster families increased from 978 in 2023-24 to 1 112 in 2025-26 (as at end-2025), representing an increase of about 14 per cent.

Moreover, starting from January 2025, the Government has allocated additional resources to strengthen support to foster parents and enhance service quality, including increasing manpower of social workers in non-governmental organisations (NGOs), providing training and professional support for foster parents, providing extra support for foster children with special learning or care needs and arranging early assessments and appropriate professional rehabilitation therapy and training for them. Additional allowances are also provided for foster children to cover the expenses for extra-curricular activities, tuition classes and interest classes, etc., thereby meeting their learning and developmental needs.

In order to recognise the contributions of foster families and promote the building of a foster-friendly society, the SWD annually holds parent-child activities for foster families which provide an opportunity for foster children to express their gratitude to the foster parents. Besides, the SWD regularly holds the Foster Families Service Award Presentation Ceremony to present awards to foster families to give recognition to their care and outstanding contributions to foster children, and at the same time call on more people to join the service with a view to bringing love and care for more children in need. In addition, the SWD has been collaborating with NGOs that provide foster care services to promote foster care through various channels and media, including inviting foster parents to share their experiences of caring for foster children on media platforms so as to recognise their dedication and contribution and raise public awareness of foster care services.

The SWD will continue to review the utilisation of foster care services and will maintain communication with NGOs providing foster care services to ensure that foster care services can meet the needs of foster children and safeguard their well-being."
立法會二十題：清理街道上的雜草,2026-02-04 12:20,2026-02-04 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400300.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上周浩鼎議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有市民反映，行人路邊及路磚之間不時有野草長出，影響衞生及市容，而據悉目前各政府部門均會委聘外判承辦商定期清理其管轄道路範圍內的雜草。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時由政府委聘以處理全港道路及街道旁雜草的外判承辦商數目及名單為何；相關政府部門有何機制監察該等外判承辦商的工作表現及績效；

（二）過去五年，第（一）項所述的外判承辦商中，因表現不達標而被施加處分的外判承辦商數目為何，並按其所負責的地區（以全港18區劃分）以表列出分項資料；

（三）過去五年，當局有否向個別外判承辦商增撥額外資源以協助其加強清理雜草；如有，有關項目的成效為何，並按外判承辦商所負責的地區（以全港18區劃分）以表列出分項資料；及

（四）有否考慮使用創新科技（例如無人機）定期巡視街道上的雜草黑點，以協助當局能更快速地發現有關問題並加強清理工作；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

公共行人路旁的植物按其種類（即樹木或其他植物）及所在土地的類別，按照發展局工務技術通告編號6/2015的分工由不同政府部門或私人土地業權人負責護養（包括進行適當修剪及清除雜草）。有關部門或土地業權人會適時安排修剪其轄下植物及清除雜草，避免植物過度生長，伸出行人路影響行人。

就周議員提問的各部分，經諮詢路政署、地政總署及康樂及文化事務署（康文署）後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）現時路政署透過委聘承建商為全港各區的公共道路進行道路維修保養工作，當中包括為位於一般道路旁伸出行人路並對行人構成即時危險的植物進行緊急修剪，以及清理行人路路磚雜草（承建商名單見附件一）。

路政署在合約內訂明，承建商須為合約涵蓋的所有行人路，每月進行至少一次巡查及完成所需的維修保養工作，包括按需要清理路面雜草，並提交完成跟進工作前後的現場照片作紀錄。雖然路政署並沒有就對行人構成即時危險的植物進行緊急修剪設立服務承諾，路政署在收到任何有關對行人或道路構成即時危險的查詢或投訴後，均會迅速安排跟進，並在七個工作天內給予回覆。路政署會按相關合約機制，就承建商未能按時妥善完成有關工作並提交報告，向其發出違約通知書及扣減合約款項。

路政署過去五年曾在發現承建商的行人路維修保養工作欠妥時，根據相關合約條款作出適當的跟進（例如向表現不理想的承建商發出違約通知書）。然而，由於相關跟進工作涉及各種維修工作欠妥的情況，路政署並無特別就清理行人路雜草工作質量問題的跟進工作分拆備存有關統計數據。

另一方面，地政總署負責未獲任何政府部門負責日常管理及保養的未批租及未撥用政府土地上的樹木及植物（通稱「樹草」）的管理，包括清理雜草。由於全港未批租及未撥用政府土地上的樹木及植物繁多，分布甚廣，地政總署只會在有需要情況（如收到投訴或轉介）下，按公眾安全和衞生考慮，以及按「風險為本」的原則（例如會否即時影響人命或財物安全，或引起蚊患），進行所需的清理工作。清理雜草的工作屬於地政總署整體樹草管理工作的一部分，相關的植物護養外判承辦商名單見附件二。

地政總署的承辦商會在接獲涉及雜草叢生的投訴／轉介日起計的指定日數內，先後向投訴人發出確認通知、實地視察及提交報告。署方會根據實際情況和工作優次（一般會優先移除和修剪較大風險的樹木），安排清理工作，並盡力在接獲個案後的兩個月內完成雜草清理。過去兩年，所有涉及清理雜草的5 256宗個案均能在兩個月內完成，亦沒有承辦商因效績不達標而受到懲處。

除此以外，康文署亦有兩類包括清除雜草的合約，即園藝保養服務合約及修剪雜草服務合約，其服務承辦商名單見附件三。

康文署會因應園藝保養工作的需要和性質，訂立不同合約的要求，包括要求承辦商提交附有相片的工作報告，以證明承辦商已完成工作並符合合約要求。另外，康文署負責監督的管理人員會進行定期實地巡查、突擊檢查，及與承辦商進行會議，監督承辦商及其員工的工作表現。若發現承辦商未能履行合約要求，康文署會按情況根據合約條款向承辦商發出勸諭信、失責通知書，甚至會終止合約等。

在過去五年，康文署並未因修剪雜草服務合約外判承辦商表現不達標而向其施加處分。至於園藝保養合約方面，因表現不達標而被施加處分的外判承辦商數目如下（註）：

註：有關處分以合約為單位，故未能提供分區細項。

（三）如上文所述，清理雜草工作屬有關部門的恆常工作，因此沒有涉及因清理雜草工作而撥用的額外財政資源。

問題：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）負責制訂和推行居者有其屋計劃（居屋）的政策，而其最終目標是鼓勵業主根據《建築物管理條例》（第344章）成立業主立案法團（法團），讓業主接管屋苑的管理責任。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（二）有否了解第（一）項所述的居屋仍未成立法團的原因為何，令房委會仍需繼續擔任其經理人；如有，具體詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）一直致力完善置業階梯，並透過提供不同種類的資助出售單位，協助不同負擔能力的家庭置業，當中包括居者有其屋計劃（居屋）。為了可以即時及有序地進行物業管理，批地文件和大廈公契規定，房委會在居屋屋苑的大廈公契生效後擔任居屋屋苑的首任公契經理人，為屋苑委聘合資格的物業管理服務公司，執行日常管理工作，包括公用地方及設施的保安、清潔和維修工作，並協助業主監察物業管理服務公司的表現。同時，根據大廈公契，公契經理人須在公契生效起計九個月內召開業主會議，以成立業主立案法團（法團）或業主委員會。根據《建築物管理條例》（第344章）（《條例》）第3（2）條，委出管理委員會（管委會）的決議，須獲過半數票（包括業主親自或委任代表投的票（註））通過，以及獲總共擁有不少於百分之三十業權份數的業主支持。

就林筱魯議員的提問，我們現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年十二月三十一日，房委會過往興建的所有187個居屋屋苑當中，已有155個居屋屋苑由相關的業主透過法團或業主委員會接管屋苑的管理工作，佔全港居屋屋苑近八成半。現時，仍然由房委會擔任公契經理人的居屋屋苑共有32個，約一半都是近五年內入伙的屋苑，當中三個屋苑已成立法團或業主委員會，接管屋苑的管理工作正在進行中。其餘的29個屋苑則須獲業主於業主大會上通過決議，才能成立法團。有關屋苑的名稱及其單位數目列於附件。

（二）《條例》為法團的成立和運作提供法律框架，以便業主成立法團，更妥善管理屋苑。就管理而言，居屋與一般私人住宅樓宇無異。房委會一直以來積極協助居屋屋苑業主籌組法團，地區民政事務處亦會按需要提供協助。在法團成立之前，房委會作為公契經理人，會督導和要求物業管理公司主動與業主作日常交流以鼓勵有興趣的業主籌組法團；房委會亦會聯絡當區的民政事務處舉辦講座，介紹有關籌組法團和大廈管理的資訊，及協助有意參加管委會的業主舉行業主大會等。至於最終能否成功成立法團接管屋苑管理，則取決於個別屋苑業主的意願。

對於未能於業主大會中通過成立法團的屋苑，房委會會繼續積極了解業主的關注，並繼續透過不同渠道向業主推廣良好有效的大廈管理方法，包括與民政事務處合作舉辦講座及派發宣傳品，讓業主體會妥善管理大廈的好處，以鼓勵他們成立法團。房委會會適時檢討推行措施的成效及繼續安排成立法團的會議，以達致推動業主成立法團及接管屋苑管理的目標。

註：除公契另有規定外，業主每擁有一份業權份數，即有一票。"

Question:

The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) is responsible for formulating and implementing the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) policy. The ultimate goal of this policy is to encourage owners to form owners' corporations (OCs) in accordance with the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344), thereby enabling them to take over the management responsibilities of their HOS courts. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that, upon the completion of HOS courts and prior to the formation of their OCs, the HKHA serves as the manager under the Deed of Mutual Covenant (the manager) for those HOS courts and appoints qualified Property Services Agents to carry out the day-to-day management of the HOS courts, of the current number of HOS courts for which the HKHA still serves as the manager, with a breakdown by court name and number of units involved; and

(2) whether it has ascertained the reasons why the HOS courts mentioned in (1) have not yet formed OCs, thereby necessitating the HKHA's continued role as their manager; if so, of the specific details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) has all along been striving to enrich the housing ladder and assist households with different affordability to achieve home ownership through the provision of various types of Subsidised Sale Flats, including those under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS). To ensure prompt and orderly property management, the Land Grant and the Deeds of Mutual Covenant (DMC) stipulate that the HKHA will act as the initial DMC manager of the HOS courts after the date of the DMC. The HKHA shall appoint qualified Property Services Agents (PSAs) to undertake daily management matters, including security, cleaning and maintenance of common areas and facilities, whilst assisting owners in monitoring the performance of PSAs. In parallel, according to the DMC, the DMC Manager shall call a meeting of owners within nine months after the date of the DMC with a view to forming an Owners' Corporation (OC) or an Owners' Committee. Pursuant to section 3(2) of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) (the Ordinance), a resolution on the appointment of the management committee (MC) must be passed by a majority of votes of the owners (including votes cast by owners in person or by proxy (note)) and supported by the owners of not less than 30 per cent of the shares in aggregate.

  In response to the question raised by the Hon Andrew Lam, our reply is as follows:

(1) As at December 31, 2025, among all of the 187 HOS courts constructed by the HKHA, 155 of them have already been taken over by their respective owners through OCs or Owners' Committees for estate management, accounting for almost 85 per cent of all HOS courts in Hong Kong. Currently, the HKHA remains the DMC manager of 32 HOS courts, around half of which had intake within the recent past five years. Among these courts, three of them have established OCs or Owners' Committees with the handover of management responsibilities underway. As for the remaining 29 courts, the relevant resolution must be passed by owners at meetings of owners in order to establish an OC. The names of the relevant HOS courts and their respective numbers of units are listed in Annex.

(2) The Ordinance provides a legal framework for the establishment and operation of OCs, enabling owners to form OCs for better management of their housing estates. In terms of management, HOS courts are no different from general private residential properties. The HKHA has been proactively providing assistance to owners of HOS courts in forming OCs, and District Offices will also provide assistance as necessary. Prior to the establishment of an OC, the HKHA as the DMC Manager, will supervise and require the PSAs to proactively engage with owners through daily exchanges to encourage interested owners to organise an OC. The HKHA also liaises with the relevant District Offices to organise seminars sharing information on forming OCs as well as building management. Moreover, the HKHA also assists owners who would like to participate in the MC to hold meetings of owners. Whether an OC can be successfully formed ultimately to take over the estate management depends on the willingness of the owners of individual courts.

  As regards the courts where the establishment of an OC could not be passed at meetings of owners, the HKHA will continue to actively gauge the owners' concerns. We will also continue to promote good and effective building management practices through various channels, including organising seminars and distributing promotional materials in collaboration with District Offices, with a view to enlightening owners of the benefits of good building management and encouraging them to establish OCs. The HKHA will review the effectiveness of the implementation measures in due course and continue to arrange meetings for the formation of OCs, with the aim to promoting the establishment of OCs and enabling owners to take over the management of their estates.

Note: Unless otherwise stipulated in the DMC, each owner shall have one vote for each share of ownership they hold."

Question:

Some members of the public have relayed that weeds often grow along pavement edges and between paving blocks, affecting hygiene and the cityscape, and it is learnt that various government departments currently engage outsourced contractors to regularly clear weeds on the roads within their purview. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current number and list of outsourced contractors engaged by the Government to handle weeds along roads and streets across the territory; the mechanism put in place by the relevant government departments to monitor the work performance and effectiveness of these outsourced contractors;

(2) of the number of outsourced contractors mentioned in (1) that were penalised for failing to meet performance standards in the past five years, with a tabulated breakdown by district for which they are responsible (broken down by the 18 districts across the territory);

(3) whether the authorities have allocated additional resources to individual outsourced contractors in the past five years to assist them in enhancing weed clearance; if so, of the effectiveness of the relevant projects, with a tabulated breakdown by district for which outsourced contractors are responsible (broken down by the 18 districts across the territory); and

(4) whether it has considered using innovative technologies (such as drones) to conduct regular inspections of weed blackspots on streets, so as to assist the authorities in identifying the relevant problems more expeditiously and enhancing clearance efforts; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Vegetation alongside public footpaths is maintained (including carrying out appropriate pruning and weed clearance) by different government departments or private lot owners in accordance with the division of labour in the Development Bureau Technical Circular (Works) No. 6/2015 depending on the type of vegetation concerned (i.e. trees or other vegetation) and the category of land on which the vegetation is located. The relevant departments or lot owners shall arrange timely pruning of vegetation under their purview and weed clearance in order to prevent excessive growth of vegetation encroaching upon footpaths, thus adversely affecting pedestrians.

In consultation with the Highways Department (HyD), Lands Department (LandsD) and Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), my reply to the various parts of the question raised by the HonHolden Chow is as follows:

(1)and (2) The HyD currently engages contractors to carry out repair and maintenance work for the public roads across all districts of Hong Kong, including carrying out urgent trimming of vegetation extending from general roadside areas into footpaths where it poses imminent danger to pedestrians, as well as clearing weeds at footpath paving blocks (a list of contractors is at Annex I).

The HyD has stipulated in each contract that the contractor is obliged to conduct at least one monthly inspection of all footpaths covered by the contract and complete necessary repair and maintenance work, including clearing weeds from the pavement as required, and submit site photos taken before and after the follow-up work for record. Although the HyD has not set any performance pledge for urgent trimming of vegetation posing imminent danger to pedestrians, the department will promptly arrange follow-up action upon receipt of any enquiry or complaint about matters posing imminent danger to pedestrians or roads, and provide a reply within seven working days. If contractor fails to complete the relevant work properly and submit the relevant report on time, the HyD will issue a Default Notice to the contractor and deduct the corresponding contract payment in accordance with the relevant contractual mechanism.

Over the past five years, the HyD has taken appropriate follow-up actions in accordance with relevant contract provisions upon identification of deficiencies in contractors' maintenance work on footpaths (e.g. issuing Default Notices to contractors with unsatisfactory performance). However, as such follow-up actions were related to various types of maintenance deficiencies, the HyD has not separately maintained statistics specifically concerning the follow-up actions related to the quality of weed clearance work at footpaths.

On the other hand, the LandsD is responsible for the management of trees and plants (collectively referred to as ""vegetation""), including weed clearance, on unleased and unallocated government land (UUGL) not under the routine management and maintenance of any government departments. Given the large number and wide distribution of trees and vegetation on UUGL across Hong Kong, the LandsD will only carry out maintenance work as necessary (such as upon receipt of complaints or referrals) having regard to public safety and public hygiene on a ""risk-based"" approach (for example, whether there is an immediate threat to life or property or a risk of mosquito infestation). Weed clearance is part of the LandsD's overall vegetation management work and a list of contractors engaged for vegetation maintenance is at Annex II.

The LandsD's contractors shall, within specified days upon receiving a complaint/referral concerning overgrown grass, issue an acknowledgement to the complainant, then conduct a site inspection and submit a report. The department will arrange clearance operations based on the actual circumstances and operational priorities (generally prioritising removal and trimming of trees that pose higher risks). The department also strives to complete weed clearance within two months upon receipt of a case. In the past two years, all 5 256 cases involving weed clearance were completed within two months, and no contractors were penalised for failing to meet the performance standards.

In addition, the LCSD has two types of contracts that cover weed clearance, namely the Horticultural Maintenance Services Contract and the Undergrowth Cutting Services Contract. The list of service contractors for these contracts is at Annex III.

The LCSD has established different contractual requirements based on the needs and nature of horticultural maintenance work, such as requiring contractors to submit work reports with photos to prove that the contractors have completed the work and met the contract requirements. In addition, supervisory personnel of the LCSD will conduct regular on-site inspections, surprise checks, and meetings with contractors to monitor the performance of the contractors and their employees. If a contractor fails to meet the contract requirements, the LCSD will issue Advisory Letters, Default Notices, or even terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms, depending on the circumstances.

Over the past five years, the LCSD has not imposed any disciplinary measures on contractors for the weed-cutting service contract due to substandard performance. As for the horticultural maintenance contracts, the number of contractors penalised for failing to meet the contract requirements is as follows (Note):




Year

Note: The penalties are based on contracts as the unit. Hence, breakdown by district cannot be provided.

(3) As mentioned above, weed clearance work is part of the regular duties of the relevant departments. Consequently, no additional financial resources have been allocated for this purpose.

(4) Government departments are open to utilising innovative technologies (such as unmanned aircraft) to assist in monitoring work and will consider their appropriate application in carrying out inspections for the black spots with weeds on streets, taking into account the resources involved and their practical effectiveness.

In particular, the HyD has been striving to enhance the repair and maintenance of public roads through the use of innovative technologies. With a view to improving inspection efficiency and accuracy, the HyD has developed the Road Defect Detection System (RDDS), which integrates geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), high-resolution cameras and photogrammetric technologies. Road inspection vehicles equipped with the RDDS can automatically identify road surface cracks and faded road markings. The HyD is pressing ahead with the enhancement and upgrading of the system, and will incorporate a more advanced artificial intelligence algorithm known as the ""Vision Transformer"" in the next-generation system, thereby substantially improving the accuracy and processing speed of image recognition, while expanding detection capabilities to cover matters such as excessive roadside vegetation growth. The HyD will alert the relevant department(s) to step up vegetation trimming and weed clearance, or follow up with the relevant lot owners as appropriate once frequent occurrence of roadside vegetation overgrowth is observed, so as to prevent situations that may affect pedestrian safety."

主席：

二○二五年《施政報告》中提出在優質教育基金預留20億元，以推進數字教育策略發展督導委員會就推動中小學數字教育提出的策略措施，涵蓋優化課程、加強教師培訓、優化數字基建，為學校提供資源支援等。教育局在二○二五年底推出的「『智』啟學教」撥款計劃（「『智』啟學教」計劃），佔上述預留撥款中約五億元，而獲批申請的公帑資助學校各獲發一筆過50萬元撥款，以支持學校按校情和校本優勢推動數字教育，為整體中小學教育數字化轉型注入核心動力。

就文頴怡議員的提問，教育局回覆如下：

優質教育基金轄下的每個計劃，均有其指定的用途，申請獲批的學校須按個別教育計劃的特定範疇使用撥款。「『智』啟學教」計劃按既定機制處理學校申請，主要資助學校購置人工智能工具與資源（包括購買軟件、硬件、訂閱平台及校本人工智能應用方案），以及資助學生參與提升人工智能素養活動，而計劃的重點是支援學校啓動或推動其校本人工智能教育計劃。

（一）獲批申請的學校須按該計劃的既定要求，完成相關的項目，包括將「發展人工智能賦能教育」項目納入學校發展計劃及／或周年計劃，以及在不同科目／課程範疇中推行人工智能輔助教學，並發展教學例子或資源等。基於「『智』啟學教」計劃上述指定撥款用途及參與學校須完成的特定項目，並不包括支援教師修讀培訓課程，故「資助教師修讀AI相關課程」列為不恰當運用撥款的例子。相關要求已於有關通函列明，亦已於簡報會中向學校人員詳細說明。

（二）教育局同樣重視中小學科學教育，加強融入創新及數字教育學習，以及相關專業教師培訓。

二○二四／二五學年推出由優質教育基金支持的「『智』為學理」撥款計劃，以初中科學科為試點，獲批申請的學校可運用撥款，安排科學科教師報讀由專上院校或相關專業機構舉辦有關人工智能輔助教學的短期課程（包括講座及工作坊），支援學校開展人工智能輔助教學。

至於小學科學科，教育局在推出此新學科時，已持續推出「開設小學科學科教師專業培訓系列」、「小學科學與科技教育系列」等課程，通過分享會、示範課、工作坊等，與教師分享和總結教學示例；分享內容包括運用人工智能製作科學概念圖、進行電腦模擬等促進教學，亦介紹如何以微控制器進行探究活動、運用「小學科學網上學習平台」等方式輔助科學學習等，以逐步提升小學教師應用人工智能及電子工具輔助教學的專業能力。這些教師培訓課程由教育局配合課程安排內容，亦會按參與者的回饋優化培訓課程。教育局未有計劃額外資助小學教師報讀外間機構舉辦的培訓課程。

（三）教育局正編訂《中小學數字教育發展藍圖》（《藍圖》），預計今年內發表。《藍圖》涵蓋推展數字教育的方向和策略，重點包括提升學生人工智能素養與技能。此外，教育局同時草擬《人工智能素養學習架構》，並就中小學運用人工智能輔助教學的實踐原則和良好做法舉隅，供學校參考，讓教師有所依循。教育局會持續聽取數字教育策略發展督導委員會及不同持份者的意見，並繼續優化《藍圖》擬稿和相關文件，以協助學校推行數字教育，達至人工智能賦能教育的目的。

Question:

  The Education Bureau (EDB) announced in December 2025 the launch of the AI for Empowering Learning and Teaching Funding Programme (the Funding Programme) to support primary and secondary schools in utilising artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance learning and teaching effectiveness. Successful school applicants will receive one-off funding of $500,000 to purchase/subscribe to/lease AI-powered devices/services that facilitate AI-assisted teaching, and to subsidise students' participation in activities that enhance their AI literacy and skills. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in the Guidelines on the Use of Funding on AI for Empowering Learning and Teaching Funding Programme published by the EDB, subsidising teachers to enrol in AI-related courses is listed as an example of improper use of the funding, of the rationale behind it;

(2) given that the EDB launched in 2025 the AI for Science Education Funding Programme to arrange for secondary school science teachers to enrol in short courses on AI, but primary school teachers were not included in the programme, whether the authorities have launched similar programmes to subsidise primary school teachers to enrol in AI training courses; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that some members of the education sector consider that the Funding Programme only mentions the objective of ""enhancing students' AI literacy and skills"", but does not provide clear teaching guidelines, whether the authorities will specify a teaching framework for schools to follow; if so, of the details; and

(4) as regards the teaching of AI literacy and skills, whether the authorities will provide systematic teaching resources to support teachers and schools, such as platforms for sharing teaching resources; if so, of the details?

Reply:

President,

  As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, $2 billion has been set aside in the Quality Education Fund (QEF) to take forward the strategic measures proposed by the Steering Committee on Strategic Development of Digital Education (Steering Committee) for promoting digital education in primary and secondary schools, which cover optimising curricula, strengthening training for teachers, optimising digital infrastructure, and providing resource support for schools. With an allocation of approximately $500 million from the above funding earmarked, the AI for Empowering Learning and Teaching Funding Programme (the Funding Programme) launched by the Education Bureau (EDB) in late 2025 disburses a one-off funding of $500,000 to each successful publicly-funded school applicant, so as to support their promotion of digital education according to their specific circumstances and school-based advantages. This serves as a core driving force for the overall digital transformation in primary and secondary schools.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Ginny Man is as follows:

  Each programme under the QEF has its designated purposes. Successful school applicants are required to use the funding for the specific areas of individual education programmes. Schools' applications are processed in accordance with the established mechanism under the Funding Programme, which mainly subsidises schools to procure artificial intelligence (AI) tools and resources (including purchase of hardware and software, as well as subscriptions to platforms and school-based AI application solutions), and subsidises students to participate in activities for AI literacy enhancement. The main purpose of the Funding Programme is to support schools in initiating or promoting school-based education programmes related to AI.

(1) Successful school applicants are required to fulfil the prescribed requirements under the Funding Programme, such as incorporating the ""Development of AI-empowered Education"" into the School Development Plan and/or Annual School Plan, and implementing AI-‍assisted teaching in different subjects/curriculum areas with development of teaching examples or learning and teaching resources. The designated purposes of the funding approved and the requirements prescribed for the participating schools under the Funding Programme do not include supporting teachers to enrol in training courses. As such, ""subsidising teachers to enrol in AI-related courses"" is listed as an example of improper use of the funding. This has been specified in the relevant circular memorandum and explained in detail to the school personnel during the briefing sessions.

(2) The EDB attaches equal importance to science education in primary and secondary schools. The EDB has stepped up efforts to integrate learning elements of innovation and digital education and enhance related professional training for teachers.

  Launched with the funding support from the QEF in the 2024/25 school year, the AI for Science Education Funding Programme was for pilot implementation in Junior Secondary Science. Successful school applicants may use the funding to enrol science teachers in short courses (including seminars and workshops) on AI-assisted teaching offered by tertiary institutions or related professional bodies, with a view to supporting the schools in taking forward AI-assisted teaching.

  As for Primary Science, since the introduction of this new subject, the EDB has been offering courses, such as Professional Teacher Training Series for Introduction of Primary Science, and Science and Technology Education Series at Primary Level, to share and consolidate teaching exemplars with teachers through sharing sessions, classroom demonstrations, workshops, etc. The sharing covers the enhancement of teaching effectiveness by, among others, using AI to generate science conceptual diagrams and employing computer simulations, as well as the ways to aid science learning, such as conducting inquiry activities with the use of microcontrollers and accessing the Primary Science Online Learning Platform, so as to progressively enhance the professional competence of primary teachers in using AI and e-tools to assist teaching. These teacher training courses are designed according to the curriculum by the EDB, and will be refined with reference to participants' feedback. At present, the EDB has no plans to further subsidise primary teachers to enrol in training courses offered by external organisations.

(3) The Blueprint for Digital Education Development in Primary and Secondary Schools, which is being formulated by the EDB, is expected to be released within this year. The Blueprint will map out the directions and strategies for implementing digital education, with a focus on enhancing the AI literacy and skills of students. Meanwhile, the EDB is also formulating an AI literacy learning framework and working on illustrations of the implementation principles and good practices for AI-‍assisted teaching in primary and secondary levels for schools' reference and teachers to follow. The EDB will continue to listen to the views of the Steering Committee and other stakeholders, as well as refine the draft Blueprint and relevant documents, with a view to supporting the implementation of digital education in schools to achieve the objective of using AI to empower education.

(4) The EDB is committed to providing schools with quality teaching materials, including learning and teaching resources for different subjects, covering the Key Learning Areas and cross-disciplinary subjects or areas of the school curriculum. In view of the trend of digital education development, the EDB Educational Multimedia platform has launched for some of its short videos a pilot ""AI-assisted teaching"" function, which will undergo continuous development and optimisation according to feedback. The EDB, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Education City (HKEdCity), has also been providing one-stop services on e-learning, e-reading and e-assessment tailored to the needs of local schools, including platforms such as the eRead Scheme and the Student Assessment Repository (STAR), to tie in with the provision of the online learning platform and courses related to AI and computational thinking for students. In addition, the HKEdCity will continue to enhance relevant e-learning resources and platforms with the support of technology enterprises to further achieve the aim of sharing resources."
DH urges public to adopt healthy lifestyle and conduct regular cancer screening in support of World Cancer Day 2026,2026-02-04 12:10,2026-02-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400274.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) today (February 4) urged members of the public to adopt a healthy lifestyle and conduct regular cancer screening in support of World Cancer Day 2026.

The Government attaches great importance to cancer prevention and control. Since 2004, the Cervical Screening Programme, the Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme and the Breast Cancer Screening Pilot Programme (BCSPP) have been sequentially introduced to enhance the recovery rate of patients through ""early prevention, early detection and early treatment"". Data show that over 80 per cent of cervical cancer cases detected through regular cervical screening were in early stages. Among the colorectal cancer cases diagnosed under the Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme, over half were early-stage. Furthermore, 97 per cent of patients diagnosed in Phase I of the BCSPP were at early stages. This indicates that regular screening can significantly increase the detection rate of early-stage cancer cases, thereby improving the recovery rate.

Over the past decade, the age-standardised mortality rate for cancer has shown a steady decline after adjusting for population age structure. Specifically, the cancer mortality rate significantly decreased by 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women on average every year. The five-year relative survival rate of cancer patients in Hong Kong has increased by 10 percentage points over the past decade, reaching 56 per cent, with particularly notable improvements in lung cancer survival rates. These findings demonstrate the significant effectiveness of the Government's initiatives in advancing cancer prevention and control.

""Cancer has been the leading cause of death in Hong Kong for many years, causing over 15 000 deaths in 2024. It is worth noting that obesity increases the risk of various cancers, including breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Approximately 40 per cent of cancer cases can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle, such asa balanced diet, regular exercise, refraining from smoking and alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy body weight and waist circumference,"" the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The DH has been promoting a healthy lifestyle as the primary strategy for cancer prevention and is committed to enhancing public awareness of cancer prevention and screening.Dr Tsui reminds the public to consult their doctors to understand the benefits and limitations of screening tests in order to make an informed decision before undergoing screening. Relevant health advice is available on the website of the CHP.

To prevent cervical cancer, the DH has been providing free human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations to eligible primary schoolgirls under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme since the 2019/20 school year. A high vaccination rate of over 90 per cent has been maintained over the past few years, significantly reducing the risk of cervical cancer in Hong Kong females. The DH also launched a one-off HPV Vaccination Catch-up Programme in December 2024, offering free catch-up vaccinations to female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their HPV vaccination. At present, the estimated first-dose HPV vaccine coverage rates of eligible secondary schoolgirls and post-secondary institution female students in the first two phases are 85 per cent and 68 per cent respectively.

To prevent hepatitis B infection, the Government has been providing hepatitis B vaccines to all newborn babies since 1988. The current vaccination coverage rate among school children has reached 99 per cent. According to the Population Health Survey 2020-22, the prevalence of hepatitis B among those under 35 years old has dropped to below 1 per cent. In addition, the Primary Healthcare Commission will also launch the Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme on February 7 to identify people with chronic hepatitis B in the community at an early stage and provide long-term follow-up services, with a view to reducing their risk of having cirrhosis, liver cancer and other serious complications.

The District Health Centres (DHCs) set up by the Primary Healthcare Commission are actively promoting the Life Course Preventive Care Plan. A personalised preventive care plan is formulated to address the health needs of citizens across different life stages. DHCs identify and assist to continuously manage risk factors associated with cancers through conducting health assessments for DHC members. DHCs assist and refer eligible persons to doctors who have enlisted in the Primary Care Directory and enrolled in the government cancer screening programmes for screening. Meanwhile, DHCs and Women Wellness Satellites also provide members of the public with information related to breast cancer and cervical cancer prevention, related screening services, according to their needs. DHCs will arrange for women who are Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients or holders of valid medical fee waiver certificates to receive preventive care and health promotion services for women, including breast and cervicalcancer screenings, at selected Family Medicine Clinics or Family Medicine Integrated Centres of the Hospital Authority (HA).

The HA has implemented a host of measures to enhance cancer care services. A multidisciplinary approach is adopted for diagnostic services to provide timely investigations and diagnoses for suspected cancer patients. The HA has implemented this service model in three clusters for suspected lung cancer patients and will expand the service in phases. With the installation of new linear accelerators in HA hospitals in phases from 2024-25, the service capacity for cancer treatment will be enhanced. Meanwhile, the HA has also expanded the coverage of the Drug Formulary by incorporating new cancer treatment drugs and broadening the scope of clinical applications of existing Special Drugs. Being patient-centred, the HA has devised personalised care programmes, such as the Cancer Case Manager Programme and Systemic Anti-cancer Therapy Clinic service, to better support patients along their journey.

The Government will continue to adopt a multipronged approach to promote cancer prevention and control and consolidate Hong Kong's leading position in cancer research and prevention and control. The Government is also committed to optimising services and providing appropriate treatment for all cancer patients.

實踐健康生活和定期接受癌症篩查　響應二○二六年「世界癌症日」,2026-02-04 12:10,2026-02-04 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400272.htm,"​衞生署今日（二月四日）呼籲市民，透過實踐健康生活和定期接受癌症篩查，響應二○二六年「世界癌症日」。

政府十分重視癌症防控工作，自二○○四年開始先後推出子宮頸普查計劃、大腸癌篩查計劃和乳癌篩查先導計劃，透過「早預防、早發現、早治療」，提升患者康復機會。數據顯示，子宮頸癌定期篩查的確診個案中，超過八成屬早期；大腸癌篩查計劃發現的個案逾半屬早期；而乳癌篩查先導計劃第一階段中確診的個案有97%屬早期。由此可見，定期篩查能顯著提升早期癌症個案發現率，提高治癒率。

在剔除人口年齡結構因素後，過去10年間，香港整體癌症的年齡標準化死亡率呈現穩步下降趨勢，其中男性死亡率平均每年顯著下降百分之二點八，女性死亡率平均每年下降百分之一點七。香港癌症病患五年相對存活率在過去10年間提升了10個百分點，達到56%，其中肺癌生存率的提升尤為明顯。由此可見，政府推動癌症預防和控制工作成效顯著。

衞生署衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「癌症是香港多年來的頭號殺手，二○二四年共造成超過15 000人死亡。值得留意的是，肥胖會增加多種癌症如乳腺癌、大腸癌和胰臟癌等的風險；而約四成癌症個案是可以透過採取健康生活方式預防，例如均衡飲食、恆常運動、避免吸煙和飲酒，以及保持健康體重和腰圍。」

衞生署一直推廣健康生活模式作為預防癌症的首要策略，並致力加強公眾對癌症預防和篩查的認識。徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，進行篩查前，應諮詢醫生了解篩查測試的好處和局限，以作出知情決定。市民可到衞生防護中心網頁瀏覽有關健康建議。

為預防子宮頸癌，自二○一九／二○學年起，衞生署在「香港兒童免疫接種計劃」下，為合資格小學女童免費接種人類乳頭瘤病毒（HPV）疫苗，疫苗接種率目前繼續維持於超過九成的極高水平，大大減低香港女性患上子宮頸癌的機會。衞生署並於二○二四年十二月開展一次性補種計劃，為二○○四年至二○○八年出生、尚未完成接種的合資格女性香港居民提供免費補種。目前合資格全日制中學及專上院校女生的第一劑疫苗覆蓋率分別估算為85%及68%。

為預防乙型肝炎（乙肝）病毒感染，政府自一九八八年起為所有新生嬰兒接種乙肝疫苗。現時學童疫苗接種率達99%。根據二○二○至二二年度人口健康調查，35歲以下年齡組別的乙肝感染率已低於1%。除了衞生署的服務外，基層醫療署亦將於二月七日推出「乙型肝炎共同治理計劃」，及早識別社區中的慢性乙肝患者並長期跟進，以減低他們出現肝硬化和肝癌等嚴重併發症的風險。

基層醫療署轄下的地區康健中心亦積極推廣健康人生計劃，為市民制訂不同人生階段的個人化健康策略。康健中心為會員進行健康風險評估，識別和協助持續管理與癌症有關的風險因素，並協助及轉介合資格人士至《基層醫療指南》內參與政府癌症篩查計劃的醫生。康健中心及樂妍站會為有需要市民提供預防乳癌和子宮頸癌的資訊和篩查服務。就綜合社會保障援助計劃受助人或持有有效醫療費用減免證明書的婦女，康健中心會安排她們到指定醫院管理局（醫管局）家庭醫學診所／家庭醫學綜合中心接受包括乳癌和子宮頸癌篩查的婦女預防性保健及健康促進服務。

在治療方面，醫管局則已實施一系列措施提升癌症護理服務。醫管局採取跨專業模式進行診斷服務，為疑似癌症患者提供及時檢查和診斷。醫管局已為疑似肺癌患者在三個聯網推行此服務模式，並會陸續擴展。其轄下醫院由二○二四至二○二五年度起逐步加裝直線加速器，提升癌症治療的服務量。醫管局亦擴大藥物名冊的涵蓋範圍，納入新的癌症治療藥物和擴大現有專用藥物的臨床應用範圍。醫管局以病人為中心，制訂個人化護理計劃，如「癌症個案經理計劃」和「全身性抗癌藥物治療診所服務」，以提供更好支援。

政府會繼續多管齊下推動癌症防控工作，鞏固香港在癌症研究及防控工作的領先地位，並致力優化對癌症病人的服務、為他們提供適切治療。

立法會十七題：推動無紙化的政策措施,2026-02-04 12:03,2026-02-04 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400305.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上李鎮強議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

政府部門一直積極推動環保政策及措施，當中包括辦公室「無紙化」。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，過去五年每年所有政府部門的總耗紙量為何（以表列出）；

（二）有否計劃協調相關政府部門及公用事業機構，安排公共服務帳單（例如水費、電費、煤氣費、差餉及稅單等）在「智方便」平台統一發放及處理；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）政府有否就推動政府及社會以「無紙化」方式通訊制訂具體的政策及計劃；如有，詳情及時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢環境及生態局和財經事務及庫務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）政府一向重視環保及減廢回收工作，環境保護署透過制定內部指引，要求各政策局／部門（局／部門）從源頭減少廢物，包括雙面使用紙張、回收再造廢紙，以及優先採用電子方式（如網頁、電郵）發布資訊，以減少使用紙張。各局／部門每年須編寫並在其網站上發布環保工作報告，闡述他們在日常運作中維持環保管理的具體行動，其中包括節約用紙的相關措施，但政府沒有就各部門的總用紙量作出年度統計。

（二）為推動電子化政務服務及減少用紙，政府透過「智方便」一站式個人化數碼服務平台加強整合公共服務帳單的發放及處理，同時支援電子支付選項，以提升公共服務效率，亦有助節省行政開支與紙張耗用，推動優化資源。

現時，「智方便」已支援超過1 300項政府及公私營機構的網上服務及電子表格，包括水務署的「水務易」、差餉物業估價署的「差餉地租單」、稅務局的「稅務易」、香港電燈有限公司（港燈）的「港燈網上通」、香港中華煤氣有限公司（中華煤氣）的「煤氣網上客戶中心」，以及中華電力有限公司的「中電One」流動應用程式。市民可透過「智方便」登入相關服務，查閱及處理各項公共服務帳單。「智方便」個人助理頁面的帳單功能亦已支援水務署的水費單及港燈的電費單繳付，此外，中華煤氣及稅務局的相關功能亦即將推出，以便利市民電子查閱及繳費，從而減少使用紙本帳單及收據，進一步推動公共服務無紙化。

（三）目前，所有政府部門已採用「智方便」為市民提供方便和一站式的電子服務。「智方便」的登記用戶已超過410萬，每日使用量超過18萬人次，實現政府服務「一網通辦」的目標。政府一直積極透過不同渠道向市民宣傳及推廣「智方便」，介紹各項服務和功能，讓他們了解「智方便」所帶來的便利，亦有助推動無紙化。

此外，數字政策辦公室聯同政府檔案處已於二○二五年年底在各部門全面推行電子檔案保管系統，使部門能夠以電子方式保存及管理檔案，提升效率，減少用紙。

在社會及企業方面，二○二五年四月十七日起，政府實施新安排，容許公司採用默示同意機制透過網站向股東發布通訊，推動本地公司以無紙化方式作出公司通訊。此外，政府亦透過推行電子投標系統，鼓勵採購無紙化。

政府各局及部門會繼續採取措施，推動政府及社會「無紙化」的通訊和業務。"
LCQ17: Policy initiatives to promote paperless practices,2026-02-04 12:03,2026-02-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400313.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lee Chun-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

 Government departments have been actively promoting environmental protection policies and measures, including ""paperless"" practices in offices. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the total paper consumption of all government departments in each of the past five years (set out in a table);

(2) whether it has plans to co-ordinate relevant government departments and public utilities to arrange for the unified issuance and processing of utility bills (such as water, electricity and gas charges, rates and tax demand notes) on the ""iAM Smart"" platform; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the Government has formulated specific policies and plans to promote the use of ""paperless"" communication by the Government and the community; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

​In consultation with the Environment and Ecology Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The Government has all along attached great importance to environmental protection, waste reduction and recycling. The Environmental Protection Department has issued internal guidelines requiring all bureaux and departments (B/Ds) to take measures to reduce waste at source, including double-sided printing, recycling of waste paper, and prioritising the use of electronic means, such as websites and emails, for information dissemination with a view to minimising paper consumption. Each B/D is required to publish an annual environmental report on its website, setting out the actions taken to uphold environmental management in their daily operations, including relevant measures to reduce paper consumption. However, the Government does not compile annual statistics on the total paper consumption of all departments.

(2)To promote e-government services and reduce paper usage, the Government has strengthened the integration of issuance and processing of utility bills through ""iAM Smart"", the one-stop personalised digital services platform, while supporting electronic payment options. This not only improves the efficiency of public services but also helps reduce administrative costs and paper consumption, thereby optimising resources utilisation.

At present, ""iAM Smart"" supports over 1 300 online services and e-forms provided by the Government as well as public and private organisations, including the ""eWater"" service of the Water Supplies Department (WSD), the ""eRVD"" bill service of the Rating and Valuation Department, ""eTax"" of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), ""Account-On-Line"" of the Hongkong Electric Company Limited (HK Electric), the ""Towngas eService Centre"" of the Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited (Towngas), and the ""CLP One"" mobile app of the CLP Power Hong Kong Limited. Citizens can log in to relevant services via ""iAM Smart"" to view and manage various utility bills. The ""Bills"" function on the ""iAM Smart"" personal assistant page already supports payment of water and electricity bills from the WSD and HK Electric respectively. In addition, relevant functions for Towngas and the IRD will be launched soon. These initiatives facilitate electronic viewing and payment by citizens, thereby reducing the use of paper bills and receipts and further advancing the ""paperless"" delivery of public services.

(3)At present, all government departments have adopted ""iAM Smart"" to provide convenient and one-stop online services for citizens. The number of registered users has exceeded 4.1 million, with more than 180 000 daily usages, achieving the goal of providing a single portal for online government services. The Government has been actively promoting ""iAM Smart"" through various channels, introducing its services and functions to citizens with a view to helping them understand the convenience it brings, which in turn helps drive ""paperless"" practices.

In addition, the Digital Policy Office and the Government Records Service have fully implemented the electronic recordkeeping system across all departments by the end of 2025. This enables departments to store and manage records electronically, which helps enhance efficiency and reduce paper use.

As regards society and corporations, since April 17, 2025, the Government has implemented new arrangement to allow companies to adopt implied consent mechanism for disseminating corporate communication by means of website, in order to promote ""paperless"" corporate communication for Hong Kong companies. The Government also promotes ""paperless"" procurement through implementing the e-Tendering System.

Various B/Ds will continue to take measures to promote ""paperless"" communication and operations in the Government and in society."
行政長官在香港文學舘「老夫子帶你闖蕩江湖——香港新派武俠小說展」開幕典禮致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2026-02-04 12:00,2026-02-04 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400262.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（二月四日）在香港文學舘「老夫子帶你闖蕩江湖——香港新派武俠小說展」開幕典禮的視像致辭：

羅光萍舘長（香港文學舘舘長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。我在此祝賀香港文學舘主辦的「老夫子帶你闖蕩江湖——香港新派武俠小說展」正式開幕。

文學透過文字觸動人心，涵養品格，啓發思想。好的文學作品能夠照亮心靈，是社會重要的精神資源。香港作家植根於中西文化交融的土壤，累積了深厚的文學底蘊，創作出很多優秀作品，成為這座城市珍貴的文化資產。

香港文學舘透過主題展覽、講座、寫作課程、文學導覽、跨界合作和數字傳播等多種形式，致力將文學融入科技、將藝術連結社區，從而豐富香港的文化面貌，促進人文交流，提升公眾對文學的認識和參與。這些工作為年輕一代的創作與文化傳承提供有力支持，讓文學在城市之中有具體的呈現空間。

「老夫子」是陪伴幾代香港人的經典漫畫角色，他鮮明的性格、幽默的風格，反映社會百態和市民心聲，富有本地文化色彩。這次香港文學舘與「老夫子」的跨界合作，是一次文化創新與融合的嘗試。展覽以生動的方式，將「老夫子」與「新派武俠小說」這兩種深入民心的文化元素結合，以新穎有趣的方式，讓大家重溫武俠故事中的俠義情懷、認識武俠文學的發展脈絡，為推動文學普及提供了新的途徑。

我期待香港文學舘未來繼續舉辦多元的文學活動，發揮推動文化傳承的積極角色。我呼籲社會各界共同關注和支持香港文學的發展，一同灌溉這片蘊育人文精神的土壤。

最後，我祝展覽圓滿成功，讓各位在「老夫子」的引領下，暢遊武俠江湖，享受一段愉快而富有收穫的文學時光。多謝大家。"
立法會十二題：鞏固香港債券中心地位,2026-02-04 12:00,2026-02-04 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020300584.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上李惟宏議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

《2025年施政報告》提出，政府會推進鞏固香港債券中心地位，包括提升市場流動性、推動使用離岸中國國債作為不同清算所抵押品，以及在港推出離岸國債期貨等。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見指出，不少上市債券的成交薄弱，政府有何措施激活債券市場，從而提升相關債券的成交額；會否促請監管機構重新審視專業投資者的資格要求，以及降低相關債券的入場門檻，讓更多零售投資者參與債券交易；

（二）就推動使用離岸中國國債作為不同清算所抵押品，目前有否具體落實時間表；政府會否研究，推動不同清算所將抵押品的適用範圍逐步擴大至包括歐元區國債及其他經濟發達國家主權債券；

（三）政府有何措施加快落實在港推出離岸國債期貨的政策；會否考慮推出其他經濟發達國家主權債券期貨產品；及

（四）鑑於政府在二○二五至二○二六財政年度的《財政預算案》宣布，會積極探討將已發行的傳統債券代幣化，現時有關政策的實施進度為何；會否考慮在有關代幣化的過程中，引入更多零售投資者和金融中介機構參與？

答覆：

主席︰

政府一直致力推動本地債券市場的發展，務求令香港作為國際金融中心能發揮更多元化的功能。透過以創新的形式定期發行政府債券（包括機構、零售、綠色和代幣化債券等）激活市場、提升市場基礎建設，及推行發行資助（如綠色和可持續金融資助計劃）和稅務優惠（如合資格債務票據計劃）等措施，香港已發展成亞洲區的國際債券發行樞紐。以安排亞洲機構向國際發行的債券規模計算，香港從二○○八年起連續十七年為區內第一，其中十年更位居世界第一，二○二四年通過香港安排的發行規模超過1,300億美元，市場份額達到近百分之三十。其中，香港更分別佔首次債券發行市場約百分之七十，以及綠色和可持續債券發行市場的百分之四十五，印證了香港在各細分領域中均處於領先地位。此外，香港離岸人民幣債券市場近年發展蓬勃，離岸人民幣債券發行金額在二○二四年達1.07萬億元人民幣，按年上升百分之三十七，亦自二○一七年起連續七年錄得增長。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出，將持續構建領先的債券市場及蓬勃的貨幣市場。政府與金融監管機構正推展一系列措施，包括促進一級市場發行、促進二級市場流動性、擴展離岸人民幣業務及新世代基建，進一步鞏固香港作為固定收益及貨幣中心的策略性地位。證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）與香港金融管理局（金管局）於二○二五年九月聯合發布《固定收益及貨幣市場發展路線圖》（《路線圖》）詳述有關措施。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢金管局、證監會及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所），現回覆如下：

（一）就上市債券目前的情況，截至二○二六年一月二日，港交所共有1 351隻上市債券，當中1 302隻為根據《上市規則》第三十七章向專業投資者發行的債券（第三十七章債券）。雖然第三十七章債券於港交所上市，該等債券一般主要於場外（OTC）買賣，而非在港交所內進行。此外，債券通常屬於持有至到期的投資產品，投資者購買債券往往持有至到期，因此第三十七章債券在交易所市場流通性方面可能較為有限。

有別於向零售投資者發售的債券，第三十七章提供簡化及快捷的債券上市流程，港交所採取較為寬鬆的方式進行審批。由於第三十七章並沒有訂明可上市的債券類型，當中具備特殊或複雜特徵的債券（例如屬永續性質或後償性質，或具有浮息或延遲派付利息條款的債券）均可按第三十七章上市，有關債券或未必適合零售投資者。

為了提升整體債券市場的流動性，證監會正研究由市場建立和營運的債券電子化交易平台的可行性。就此，證監會已委任外部顧問，並已開始與市場參與者、市場營運者及監管機構進行訪談。與此同時，證監會亦正積極推動在香港建立商業回購市場和中央交易對手制度，包括就有關的結算系統展開可行性研究。我們會繼續積極推展上述《路線圖》列舉的有關措施，務求從提升市場效率和交易透明度，以及減低對手方信用風險等方面，為本港債券市場的進一步發展構建穩固基礎。

（二）港交所一直致力提升香港證券及衍生品市場的活力及競爭力。香港場外結算公司自二○二五年一月起已開始接受境外投資者使用債券通持倉中的在岸國債和政策性金融債作為北向互換通的履約抵押品，並在同年三月起將安排拓展至所有衍生品交易。有關措施能夠進一步拓寬在岸人民幣債券在離岸市場作為抵押品的用途，為國際投資者提供更大的靈活性和提高資本效率，進一步增強人民幣資產的吸引力，推動人民幣國際化。港交所將繼續與市場各方緊密合作，持續檢討相關抵押品安排，在平衡各種風險下探索納入新產品，為投資者提供更多元化的抵押選擇，進一步鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐和領先風險管理中心的地位。

（三）政府、金融監管機構和港交所一直致力深化及擴大兩地資本市場互聯互通。在中央人民政府大力支持下，債券通、跨境理財通、交易所買賣基金納入互聯互通標的、互換通等多項增量擴容措施近年已相繼落實。其中，截至二○二五年十二月底，境外機構透過債券通等渠道持有內地債券的總規模超過34,000億元人民幣，債券通北向通的日均成交量二○二五年達約390億元人民幣。

隨着環球投資者對以人民幣計價產品的需求日趨殷切，香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐和風險管理中心的角色越見重要。香港特別行政區政府致力不斷豐富人民幣計價投資產品和風險管理工具，以滿足海內外投資者的需要。兩地監管機構已宣布支持在香港推出離岸國債期貨，為在港投資國債引入有效的離岸風險管理工具。相關籌備工作已大致完成，證監會會繼續與港交所緊密合作落實措施。

此外，港交所會繼續致力豐富其衍生產品庫，對於發行新產品，包括其他經濟體資產為標的的衍生品持積極開放態度。

（四）政府自二○二三年起已發行三批代幣化綠色債券，並會在日後持續發行代幣化債券，期望為市場帶來示範作用，及提供高質量的代幣化債券供應，從而推動香港代幣化債券市場的更廣泛發展。例如，於二○二五年十一月發行的代幣化綠色債券，成功擴大市場參與，發行金額達100億港元，為當時全球最大的代幣化債券發行。此批債券受廣泛環球機構投資者歡迎，包括不少首次認購代幣化債券的投資者，總認購金額超過1,300億港元等值。與以往的發行相比，安排銀行及相關數碼資產平台的直接參與者數量也有所增加。

為提升代幣化債券的吸引力及需求，金管局亦正研究代幣化債券的二級市場應用場景，例如以數碼原生債券和代幣化的已發行傳統債券作為回購融資抵押品，研究結果將會適時公布。此外，政府和金管局正共同研究現行的法律框架，以探討優化措施，從而推動代幣化技術在香港債券市的更廣泛應用。

零售投資者參與方面，金管局早前透過與國際結算銀行創新樞紐合作進行的Project Genesis完成概念認證。不過，要實現相關概念涉及法律、科技和操作等多個層面，並需要整個發行鏈不同參與者的配合。金管局亦正在評估目前形式的代幣化債券是否能夠滿足零售投資者的需求。政府及監管機構會繼續與業界溝通，探索如何有效及適當地將代幣化債券應用於零售層面。"
LCQ12: Consolidating Hong Kong's position as a bond market hub,2026-02-04 12:00,2026-02-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020300582.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Robert Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

 The 2025 Policy Address proposed that the Government would further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a bond market hub, including, among others, improving market liquidity, promoting the use of offshore Chinese Government Bonds as collateral in different clearing houses, and introducing offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views pointing out that many listed bonds have weak trading volumes, what measures the Government has put in place to invigorate the bond market and thereby increase the trading volumes of such bonds; whether it will urge the regulatory bodies to re-‍examine the qualification requirements for professional investors and lower the entry threshold for such bonds, so that more retail investors can engage in bond trading;

(2) whether there is currently a specific implementation timetable for promoting the use of offshore Chinese Government Bonds as collateral in different clearing houses; whether the Government will study promoting in different clearing houses the gradual expansion of the range of acceptable collateral to include eurozone government bonds and sovereign bonds from other economically developed countries;

(3) what measures the Government has put in place to expedite the implementation of the policy to introduce offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong; whether it will consider introducing futures products of sovereign bonds from other economically developed countries; and

(4) as the Government announced in the 2025-2026 Budget that it would actively explore tokenising traditional bonds issued, of the current progress of implementing the relevant policy; whether it will consider engaging more retail investors and financial intermediaries in the relevant tokenisation process?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been striving to promote the development of the local bond market, with a view to enabling Hong Kong performing a more diversified function as an international financial centre. Through providing impetus to the market by issuing government bonds regularly in innovative ways (such as issuance of institutional, retail, green and tokenised bonds), enhancing market infrastructure, as well as issuance subsidy schemes (e.g. the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme) and tax incentive schemes (e.g. the Qualifying Debt Instrument Scheme) and others, Hong Kong has developed into a hub for international bond issuance in Asia. In terms of bonds issued internationally by Asia-based entities, Hong Kong ranked first in the region for seventeen consecutive years since 2008, with ten years ranking first globally. The volume of Asian international bonds arranged in Hong Kong totalled over US$130 billion and accounted for around 30 per cent of the market in 2024. Among these issuances, Hong Kong has captured around 70 per cent of debut issuances, and 45 per cent green and sustainable bond issuances, demonstrating our leading position in different segments. Meanwhile, offshore RMB (Renminbi) bond market in Hong Kong recorded solid development over the past few years, with offshore RMB bond issuance reaching RMB1.07 trillion in 2024, having increased by 37 per cent year-on-year and expanded for seven years in a row since 2017.

 As stated in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, we will continue to expand a world-class bond market and a vibrant currency market. The Government and financial regulators are taking forward a series of measures, including boosting issuance in primary market, enhancing liquidity in secondary market, expanding offshore Renminbi business, and next-generation infrastructure, with a view to further consolidating Hong Kong's strategic position as a leading Fixed Income and Currency (FIC) hub. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) jointly announced the Roadmap for the Development of FIC Markets (Roadmap) in September 2025 which outlined the relevant initiatives.

 After consultation with the HKMA, the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), the reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Regarding the current situation of listed bonds, as of January 2, 2026, there were 1 351 listed bonds on HKEX, of which 1 302 were issued to professional investors under Chapter 37 of the Listing Rules (Chapter 37 Bonds). While Chapter 37 Bonds are listed on HKEX, such bonds are generally traded over-the-counter rather than on HKEX. Moreover, bonds are typically held-to-maturity investment products, with investors often purchasing them with the intention of holding until maturity, therefore Chapter 37 Bonds may not have ample liquidity in the listed market.

 In contrast to bonds offered to retail investors, Chapter 37 offers a streamlined and expedient listing process for bonds under which HKEX adopts a ""light touch"" approach for vetting. Since Chapter 37 does not prescribe the type of bonds that could be listed and accordingly bonds with special or complex features (such as perpetual or subordinated bonds, or those with variable or deferred interest payment terms) could be listed under Chapter 37, relevant bonds may not be suitable for retail investors.

 To enhance the overall bond market liquidity, the SFC is studying the feasibility of an electronic bond-trading platform built and operated by market participants. In this regard, the SFC has appointed external consultants, and has begun interviews with market participants, market operators and regulatory authorities. Meanwhile, the SFC is also actively promoting the establishment of a commercial repo (repurchase) market and a central counterparty regime in Hong Kong, including conducting a feasibility study on setting up the relevant clearing system. We are committed to implementing the initiatives outlined in the Roadmap continuously, with a view to establishing a solid foundation for the further development of our bond market development, through enhancing market efficiency and transaction transparency, as well as reducing counterparty credit risk.

(2) HKEX is committed to enhancing the vitality and competitiveness of Hong Kong's securities and derivatives markets. Since January 2025, the OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited has started accepting onshore Chinese Government Bonds and Policy Bank Bonds held by offshore investors through Bond Connect as collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions, and extended the arrangement to all derivative transactions from March of the same year. The measure could further broaden the use of onshore Renminbi bonds as collateral in offshore markets, offering international investors greater flexibility and improved capital efficiency. This further enhances the attractiveness of RMB assets and advances RMB internationalisation. HKEX will continue to collaborate closely with market participants, regularly review relevant collateral arrangements, and explore incorporating new products while balancing various risks. These will provide investors with more diversified collateral options, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub and a leading risk management centre.

(3) The Government, financial regulators and HKEX are committed to deepening and broadening the mutual access between the Mainland and Hong Kong capital markets. With the strong support of the Central People's Government, a series of expansion measures were implemented in recent years successively, including Bond Connect, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, inclusion of exchange-traded funds under mutual access, Swap Connect, etc. Notably, as of end-December 2025, the total amount of foreign holdings of Mainland onshore bonds through different channels including Bond Connect exceeded RMB3,400 billion. The average daily turnover of Northbound Bond Connect in 2025 reached about RMB39 billion.

 As global investors' demand for RMB-denominated products grows, Hong Kong's role as a global offshore RMB business hub and risk management centre becomes increasingly important. The Government is committed to continuously enriching the suite of RMB-denominated investment products and risk management tools to meet the needs of both domestic and overseas investors. The regulators of the Mainland and Hong Kong have announced their support for the launch of offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong, introducing an effective offshore risk management tool for investing in Chinese Government Bonds in Hong Kong. The relevant preparatory work has been largely completed. The SFC will continue to work closely with HKEX to implement the measure.

 In addition, HKEX will continue to expand its derivatives product suite and maintain a positive and open stance towards issuing new products, including derivatives with assets from other economies as underlying assets.

(4) The Government has issued three tranches of tokenised green bonds since 2023. Through continuous tokenised bond issuances, the Government expects to promote the broader development of Hong Kong's tokenised bond market by creating demonstrative effects and supplying the market with high quality tokenised bonds. For instance, the tokenised green bond issuance in November 2025 successfully scaled up market participation, with an issuance size of HK$10 billion, marking the world's largest tokenised bond at the time. This issuance was well received by a wide spectrum of global institutional investors, including a substantial number of first-time tokenised bond investors, reaching a total subscription amount over HK$130 billion. Compared to the previous issuances, the number of arranging banks and direct participants to the relevant digital assets platform also increased.

 To enhance the attractiveness and demand for tokenised bonds, the HKMA is also exploring secondary market applications of tokenised bonds, which include using digitally native bonds and tokenised version of existing bonds as collaterals for repo financing. Results of the study will be announced in due course. In addition, the Government is working with the HKMA to review the current legal regime and identify potential enhancements, with a view to promoting the wider adoption of tokenisation in Hong Kong's bond market.

 Regarding retail investor participation, in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub, the HKMA completed a proof-of-concept study through Project Genesis. However, implementation of the relevant concept would involve multiple aspects, including legal, technical, and operational aspects, and would require collaboration among various parties in the entire issuance chain. At the same time, the HKMA is also assessing whether the current form of tokenised bonds can meet the needs of retail investors. The Government and regulators will continue to engage with the industry to explore how tokenised bonds can be effectively and suitably applied at the retail level."

In response to accidents involving mobile elevating work platforms at various workplaces in recent years, the LD has revised and renamed the original ""Guidance Notes on Safe Use of Power-operated Elevating Work Platforms"", incorporating common causes of the accidents and preventative measures. Major revisions include further specifying training requirements for operators, adding new operational requirements such as the installation of effective secondary guarding devices, conducting regular non-destructive tests on critical load-bearing components, and formulating emergency rescue plans. A grace period is provided for the new requirements of operator training and installation of secondary guarding devices until December 31, 2026. The industry must seize this time to make sufficient preparation before the grace period expires.

The LD will strengthen publicity, promotion, and education and training through various channels to help the industry better understand the content of the GNs. These include disseminating relevant information through the LD's website, the ""OSH 2.0"" mobile application, and the mass media. A new episode of ""Work Safety Alert"" animation, titled ""Trapped between a Mobile Elevating Work Platform and a Sprinkler Pipe"", has also been launched, and the relevant content is incorporated into the Mandatory Basic Safety Training Course (Construction Work) (commonly known as the Green Card Course) and free training courses on occupational safety and health legislation organised by the LD.
