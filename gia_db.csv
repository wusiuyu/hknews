Speech by FS at Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit (English only) (with photo),2025-11-17 11:36,2025-11-17 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700255.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Dr Emanuele Grimaldi (Chair of the International Chamber of Shipping), Your Excellencies, Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a pleasure to welcome you all to the second Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit, co-hosted by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, and the newly formed Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board.

  This important event brings together more than 300 global maritime leaders from some 30 economies for vital dialogue and collaboration. Your presence speaks to the global significance of the discussions here.

  I would like to thank the ICS for once again choosing Hong Kong to host this pivotal summit, casting a strong vote of confidence in us as an international maritime centre. Representing over 80 per cent of the world's merchant fleet, your leadership in shaping the global maritime agenda is unparalleled.

Building Resilience in an Age of Transformation

  The theme of this Summit - ""Building Resilience, Driving Growth and Investment"" - speaks directly to our moment. Global maritime trade is no doubt facing headwinds: geopolitical tensions, tariff escalations, and new trade barriers are reshaping shipping routes and disrupting established patterns. The UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) Review of Maritime Transport 2025 forecasts seaborne trade growth of merely 0.5 per cent this year, down from 2.2 per cent in 2024 - the slowest pace in years. Vessel rerouting has pushed ton-miles to record levels, forcing ships to travel longer distances at higher cost.

  Yet this is not necessarily a story of decline, but of transformation. Allow me to offer three observations.

Shifting maritime trade patterns

  First, in my view, geopolitics will reshape rather than weaken maritime trade flows. Consider China. It has stood as the world's largest manufacturing economy for 15 consecutive years, commanding close to 30 per cent of global manufacturing output. It has an industrial ecosystem spanning the entire classification of industrial categories recognised by the United Nations. Despite talk of supply chain diversification, no country possesses China's completeness, scale, efficiency or integrated capacity. Indeed, supply chain reconfiguration arising from trade tensions is creating a complementary, not substitutional, relationship across the region.

  While Southeast Asian nations are attracting more investments and manufacturing activities, in this process, they are reinforcing the two-way trade flow with China, in raw materials, components, semi-finished goods and finished products. As a matter of fact, China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)trade reached a record of some US$690 billion in the first eight months of 2025. Hong Kong, as a key re-export hub, has witnessed substantial growth in this business.
 
  As a manufacturer, China will continue to demand vast quantities of raw materials and components from Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific (like Australia). Meanwhile, as a consumer market of 1.4 billion people with a rapidly expanding middle income group, China will drive continued growth in the import of food, fashion, electronics, and more.

  At the same time, Southeast Asia, with approximately 700 million people with a median age of 32, is experiencing a significant demographic dividend. More importantly, their incomes are rising substantially. By 2030, ASEAN will contribute 140 million new consumers, representing 16 per cent of the world's new consumer class.

  Beyond Asia, the broader Global South, currently accounting for 18 per cent of global GDP, is projected to grow at 4.2 per cent annually through 2029. By 2033, South-South trade is expected to approach US$14 trillion.

  I believe this economic dynamism will be reshaping maritime trade. Intra-regional trade is emerging as a powerful engine of growth. Intra-Asia container volumes are projected to reach more than 42 million TEUs (Twenty Equipment Unit) by 2028, representing 3.8 per cent growth per year, outpacing the global average.

  The maritime sector itself is evolving, too. Intra-regional trade is driving demand for smaller, fuel-efficient vessels optimised for short-sea shipping. Scheduling patterns are also shifting to accommodate new supply chains and regional trade growth. Bulk commodities remain dominant in seaborne trade, and containerised cargo - including consumer electronics, automotive components, and renewable energy products - is experiencing robust growth, particularly in intra-Asia routes.

Decarbonisation as both imperative and opportunity

  My second observation is that decarbonisation of maritime operations is both an imperative and opportunity. The IMO (International Maritime Organization) has set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050. This is not environmental aspiration alone. It is regulatory reality.

  To this end, the liner shipping industry is making substantial progress, with 79 per cent of the deadweight tonnage of container and vehicle carriers capable of operating on renewable fuels. Yet scaling green fuel production and creating financial mechanisms to support adoption remain challenging. It requires strong political commitment and cross-sectoral collaboration.

  The opportunity is substantial. Maritime decarbonisation represents a multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunity through 2050. The transition to zero-emission marine fuels could create up to 4 million jobs globally across the energy supply chain. Here in Hong Kong, we are embracing this. For example, we have published an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, positioning ourselves as a regional hub for sustainable fuel supply. Our goal is to provide bunkering services for green fuels to ocean-going vessels more than 60 times per year by 2030, involving over 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels.

Harnessing digital transformation

  My third observation is on technology's transformative power. Ports and global container lines are commonly deploying artificial intelligence, blockchain and advanced data analytics to improve operational efficiency, optimise routes, and reduce downtime and carbon emissions. This is where Hong Kong also comes in, with our vibrant technology and startup community. Many of them are pioneering innovations in smart logistics. They can play a role not only in supporting our own transformation but also in serving the broader region.

  Technology is also reshaping what is shipped and how. As consumer preferences shift and companies adopt new production methods, the mode of maritime trade also evolves. Consumers are now preferring sustainable, traceable products, driving demand for supply chain solutions that can verify environmental and social credentials in real time. Besides, the speed of technology adoption in operation and management will determine competitive success in this decade. Those who are able to digitalise their operations will reduce costs, capture market share, and be better able to meet the expectations of increasingly sophisticated customers and regulators.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, the maritime industry stands at a pivotal moment. Geopolitical fragmentation, shifting patterns of global commerce, climate imperatives and technological advancement are formidable forces. Yet they create opportunity precisely because they demand agility, innovation and vision.

  Yes, the currents are shifting, and the waters may be uncharted. But like the explorers in the Age of Discovery, there lies tremendous opportunity for those with the vision to navigate with strategy, courage and conviction. I am convinced that the voyage ahead is one of extraordinary growth for those who are willing and ready.

  On this note, I wish you all a most rewarding Summit, and the best of health and business in the time ahead.

  And for those of you coming from afar, I would like to appeal to you: don’t just work, but enjoy the city. We have wonderful hiking trails, beaches, about 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants, great museums, and above all, we don’t impose duty on wine! And remember to shop till you drop! Thank you."

Speech by SITI at opening ceremony of Hong Kong International Computer Conference 2025 (English only),2025-11-17 11:08,2025-11-17 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700236.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, at the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong International Computer Conference (HKICC) 2025 today (November 17):

å°æ¬çè¬å¯§å¯é¨é· (Deputy Director-General of the Youth Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Ms Wan Ning), Mr Dave Chen (President of the Hong Kong Computer Society), Mr Andre Blumberg (Conference Chairperson of the HKICC 2025), Professor Jin Hai (Vice President of the China Computer Federation), Dr Albert Wong (Programme Chairperson of the HKICC 2025), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you all today at the HKICC 2025. The Conference has long served as a vital platform for cross-sector dialogue and technological advancement. This year's theme, ""Scaling AI Transformation Beyond Experimentation"", captures a timely and important leap in AI development.

 AI is evolving from exploratory initiatives to real-world applications, driving productivity, resilience and competitiveness across sectors. In addition to the national proposal of the ""AI+"" initiative last year, the 15th Five-Year Plan announced last month reaffirms our country's support for Hong Kong to develop as an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. With national support and a strategic foundation in place, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is committed to contributing to the country's prosperity by building an AI ecosystem where innovation flourishes, collaboration deepens and impact lasts.

 The HKSAR Government took a number of moves to accelerate the conversion of AI concepts into impactful applications. A key milestone is the establishment of Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) in late 2024, which will further be ramped up this year to meet the growing demand for high-performance computing power. We hope that this AISC will provide the necessary infrastructure for R&D (research and development) breakthroughs to be transformed into scalable business solutions for enterprises. We have also put in place the AI Subsidy Scheme to enable easier access for local research institutions and companies to these supercomputing resources.

 Furthermore, the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute will be established next year to serve as Hong Kong's dedicated AI institution. The Institute will focus on the full development cycle, from upstream research to midstream transformation, as well as downstream industry adoption. We are also going to enhance the Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to assist eligible small and medium-sized enterprises in adopting off-the-shelf AI solutions in their daily operations.

 In parallel, the Government is accelerating the development of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone (Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone) in the Loop (Hong Kong Park), where AI is positioned as one of the key pillar industries. To facilitate scientific research and AI application testing, we are actively exploring with the relevant Chinese Mainland authorities the expansion of the cross-boundary flow of research data from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong for use by enterprises and organisations in the Hong Kong Park. We believe the establishment of a cross-boundary data flow management mechanism will facilitate safe and convenient flow of data between the two places.

 In addition, a 10-hectare site at Sandy Ridge in the Northern Metropolis will be developed into a high-tier data facility cluster, providing advanced computing infrastructure to support data-intensive innovation across AI and data-driven industries. This will further strengthen Hong Kong's position as a regional digital infrastructure hub, and advance the development of a digital economy and smart city initiatives.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's AI journey is entering a new chapter. As we lay the infrastructural foundation and provide the necessary policy support, we call for collective efforts from across sectors to build the future of Hong Kong AI development, and participants of today's Conference are definitely our key partners on this front.

 Before I close, may I invite all registered voters to cast your vote on the polling day on December 7. My sincere gratitude goes to the Hong Kong Computer Society for bringing together this impactful event. I wish the HKICC 2025 another year of great success! Thank you."

Test results and WSD's follow-up work regarding water supply incident affecting some Taikoo Shing residents,2025-11-16 23:50,2025-11-17 00:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600776.htm,"Regarding the appearance of black particles in the drinking water of some buildings in Taikoo Shing, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) had earlier collected water samples from some households, sump and roof drinking water tanks for testing. A spokesman for the WSD stated tonight (November 16) that the analysis has just been completed, showing that all water samples have met Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards. The small amount of black particles found in the samples were confirmed to be bitumen. It is believed that water pressure changes caused by WSD's temporary redirecting of water supply near Taikoo Shing last night stirred up bitumen sediments inside the pipes. These sediments are inert substances and pose no harm to human health.

The spokesman said that the WSD had already issued a press release earlier today explaining the cause of the incident (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600466.htm), adding that the damaged filter at the estate's public water inlet was repaired last night, and pipe flushing has been strengthened. To minimise inconvenience to residents, the WSD, together with the estate's property management company, arranged for cleansing of the sump drinking water tanks of affected buildings starting tonight at off-peak water usage hours (around 12:30am), expected to finish by dawn. Cleansing of roof drinking water tanks will follow tomorrow morning during off-peak water usage hours, with completion expected within the day. After these follow-up actions, the situation of black particles in drinking water is expected to improve significantly.

Further investigation showed that the affected buildings are mainly in phases four and five, totalling 14 blocks, about 20 per cent of the estate. WSD staff have been dispatched to work with the property management office to assist residents in flushing water meters and water heater inlets. As of 9pm today, about 100 water meters have been flushed, and more than 20 technicians have been arranged to flush electric water heater inlets. These actions will continue tomorrow.

To reassure residents, the WSD will continue to place water trucks and tanks in the estate to provide temporary water supply services, and set up a service counter and work together with the property management office to answer residents' enquiries immediately. If residents notice abnormalities in their drinking water, they should notify the management office at once or call the WSD customer service hotline at 2824 5000, and arrangements will be made promptly for follow-up.

The spokesman added that to prevent occurrence of similar incidents in the future, the WSD will not only conduct routine regular inspections of the estate's inlet filters, but also check the filters before and after pipe maintenance works to ensure they remain in good condition and can effectively block sediments stirred up during such works."

政制及內地事務局局長於2025立法會「愛國者同心治港」選舉論壇：選舉委員會界別論壇後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-16 21:03,2025-11-16 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600665.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（十一月十六日）在2025立法會「愛國者同心治港」選舉論壇：選舉委員會界別論壇後會見傳媒的談話內容：

政制及內地事務局局長：謝謝大家。今日下午是我們選委界別的選舉論壇，整體來說我們的安排及各方面，我們都覺得是暢順的，包括50位候選人都全數出席，這不但顯示大家非常重視這個論壇，亦很重視這個機會，向他們的選民——選委去介紹自己的政綱和參選情況。同時，我們在現場看到，各選委與候選人之間的互動都是很良好的，充分顯示到團結和友好的選舉氛圍。我們亦都看到打氣團隊的氣氛亦相當好、很熱烈，同時亦井然有序。最難得的是，我們看到今次有超過1 100名選委參加這個論壇，看到大家都非常重視這次選舉，亦很熱切地希望了解各個候選人的情況，從而作出投票的選擇。整體來說，包括氣氛和安排上，我們覺得已經達致預期效果，亦能夠讓各個候選人闡述他們的政綱和理念，讓各位選委考慮。多謝大家。

記者：首先想問，今次的論壇一次過讓50位候選人參與，都是講述政綱，沒有回應問題時間，其實這還算是一個論壇嗎？為何會有這個設定？第二，想問每位候選人都有兩分半鐘時間發言，但剛才看見的情況是，其實很多候選人都講不完，甚至剛剛有候選人說因為時間緊迫而要精簡地説。這樣理想嗎？

政制及內地事務局局長：我們已說過，這39場論壇都會因應實際情況而制定和考慮整體安排。因應這次的選委界別，因為我們始終希望論壇，第一，會是一氣呵成的，因為如果組織幾次的話，由於選委有接近1 500名，要他們在同一時間出現，大家的公務都比較繁忙，所以我們希望能夠可以一次過安排。否則的話，（選委）有些場次可能會來，有些場次可能不來，這可能會造成不公的情況。在這個情況下，亦因應時間上的考慮，如果時間過長的話，也未必是個很理想的安排。所以，因應種種的因素，我們設定了今次這個環節是這樣安排，亦看見他們（候選人）都可以充分地講述他們的政綱以至抱負等各方面，這亦達致我們希望令選委更加了解他們的情況的這個目標。

記者：局長，去到尾段有不少選委離場，會否覺得對之後的候選人有不公平的情況出現？又想請教，我們都見到在選委區的座席上，有些並不是選委的人坐在那裏觀看，我想問問這是否符合局方本身的要求和安排呢？

政制及內地事務局局長：首先，我看到現場，而大家也看到，本身人數都相當多，正如我所講，有差不多1 100名選委出席這個論壇。當然，大家都知道選委他們本身很多時候公務都是很繁忙的，他是否會一直觀看到最後論壇結束，這要視乎實際情況以及他本身的工作時間。但問題是，就算他因事要提前離開都好，我們有提供「節目重溫」，他亦可以重看往後環節中候選人的情況，可以充分重看。的而且確，有部分選委很想了解候選人的情況，但因為時間上未必能夠親身參與，他們之前都有跟我們說過，希望可以由部分代表或者助理來到現場，聽完後再把情況轉述，從而讓他了解情況，亦有這種情況，我們都歡迎。總之可以有機會讓候選人充分地講述他們的政綱，令選委能夠充分了解，我們覺得都可以作一些彈性安排。

記者：剛才打氣環節時，五組一起（打氣），出現「疊聲」，大家聽不清楚，這個情況會不會覺得有更好的改善空間呢？第二條問題，今次邀請了選委和打氣團，但一般市民不能出席。為甚麼不邀請市民出席？會否使互動感欠缺一點？

政制及內地事務局局長：首先第一件事，我們經常說，每一個論壇我們都會因應實際情況，包括場地和時間各方面，再整體作一個設計安排。在打氣方面，雖然不是（每位候選人各有）一個獨立的打氣時間，因為時間都是一個考慮因素。如果時間過長，亦可能會影響觀眾出現疲勞的情況。所以我們的整體安排就是這樣，我們會一次性去看看情況。另一方面，我們覺得（這樣安排）氣氛會更濃厚，我們看到舉牌和候選人號碼等，各方面都可以清楚展示到候選人的打氣情況。就這一點，我認為今次的論壇已達到預期的目標。

當然，在任何情況下，我們都會因應情況作出優化。接着仍有多場論壇，我們會根據情況再作考慮。另外，剛才大家都看到，基本上現場已經滿座。選委、候選人及打氣團，基本上已坐滿整個場地。我們亦常常說，我們有現場直播，亦提供「節目重溫」，各位市民可以透過這些去了解情況。

記者：有兩條問題想問，首先想問（選舉委員會界別論壇）與地區直選的論壇相比，少了一個候選人在台上互動的環節，這樣會不會令選民對於候選人的理念、彼此的理念認知未夠深刻？另外想追問，昨日有候選人不適送院，大會說會聯絡他們跟進，最新的跟進情況是怎樣？會否造成不公，或者會提供時間讓她補回政綱、理念？

政制及內地事務局局長：基本上這都是與我剛才的說法一樣，每一場論壇都會因應其實際情況，包括場地或候選人的數目，這些都要考慮，時間亦是需要考慮的。我們就今次的選舉論壇安排了三小時進行，共有50位候選人，如果環節的數目太多，或者時間太長的話，這亦未必符合實際情況。所以我們覺得就這次安排來說，都可以讓參選人有機會將其政綱及各方面的想法向選委交代，這已經達致我們的目標。

記者：關於昨天有候選人暈倒的情況？

政制及內地事務局局長：關於昨天身體不適的候選人，我們很高興從她的個人Facebook得知，她的身體現時已沒有很大問題，我希望她可以早日康復。同時，我們亦會待她的身體狀況好轉時聯絡她，視乎她的意願，如有需要我們可以作出相關安排。謝謝大家。"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-16 18:15,2025-11-16 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600526.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 16), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 62 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases and the rest were imported cases.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the recent outbreak of CF has shown a sustained downward trend. There were 48 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (November 9 to 15), showing a further decrease compared to the previous week (November 2 to 8), which reported 107 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Jiangmen (14 cases) and Shenzhen (12 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
--------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding the recently announced local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP is still conducting genome analysis.

The CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 500 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past one day. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and one of them testednegative for chikungunya virus. Laboratory testing for the remaining samples is continuing.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
WSD closely follows up on water supply incident affecting some Taikoo Shing residents,2025-11-16 16:30,2025-11-16 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600466.htm,"Regarding the appearance of black particles in the drinking water of some Taikoo Shing households, a spokesman for the Water Supplies Department (WSD) stated today (November 16) that the department is closely following up on the situation. Since receiving the notification from the Taikoo Shing management office last night (November 15) that residents (mainly from phases four and five) had found small black particles in drinking water, the WSD immediately dispatched staff to look into the incident. Water samples were collected from affected households and the sump and roof drinking water tanks of the buildings for laboratory testing. Results are pending. Based on past experience, the black particles are believed to be bitumen protective coating in the water pipes.

To facilitate pipe maintenance works, the WSD carried out temporary redirecting of water supply near Taikoo Shing last night in which the changes in water pressure may have disturbed sediment inside the pipes. At the same time, investigations revealed damage to one of the filter facilities at the estate's public water inlet, which may have allowed a small amount of sediment to enter the estate's public water pipes, causing particles to appear in some households' drinking water. The WSD routinely inspects these inlet filters, with the most recent regular check on November 3 showing no abnormalities. The damaged filter was repaired last night, and the WSD has strengthened pipe flushing in the affected system.

The WSD understands residents' concerns. To safeguard users, it is advised that if water has remained in pipes for some time, or when using taps for the first time each morning, residents should let the water run until it becomes clear before consumption. To reassure residents, water trucks have been stationed on-site to provide temporary water supply.

Additionally, the WSD has set up a service counter at the site, working with the property management office to assist residents in flushing water meters and to answer enquiries immediately. If residents notice abnormalities in their drinking water, they should notify the management office at once or call the WSD Customer Service Hotline at 2824 5000. The WSD will arrange for staff to follow up as quickly as possible."

Speech by SCST at ceremony of Asia+ Festival 2025 and Asian Ethnic Cultural Performances+ 2025 (English only),2025-11-16 15:02,2025-11-16 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600420.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the ceremony of Asia+ Festival 2025 and Asian Ethnic Cultural Performances+ 2025 today (November 16):

Consuls-General, representatives of overseas cultural organisations, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

âGood afternoon, everyone, and a very warm welcome to the ceremony of the Asia+ Festival 2025 and the Asian Ethnic Cultural Performances+ 2025, especially warm welcome for those a few who come from afar. Welcome to Hong Kong.

The Asia+ Festival was launched in 2023 with a bold vision: to create a sustainable platform for arts and cultural exchange across Asia, and the Belt and Road regions. As a flagship festive event, it reaffirms Hong Kong's role as an East-‍‍‍meets-‍West centre for international cultural exchange. It is here that we leverage our ""one country, two systems"" advantage to promote people-‍‍to-‍people bonds and cultural integration.

Now, marching into its third edition, the Festival is growing remarkably. This year, we are thrilled to welcome distinguished artists from over 30 countries and regions, 12 of which are joining us for the very first time. While Asia remains our core, our reach now extends to Belt and Road countries and regions in Europe, Africa and the Americas.

With more than 100 performances and activities - from stage shows and exhibitions to today's outdoor carnival - we expect to welcome over 100 000 citizens and visitors. Together, we will celebrate the rich tapestry of both traditional and contemporary arts from Asia and beyond.

The festivity has already begun with a stellar opening programme: a fresh, contemporary adaptation of Chekhov's ""The Cherry Orchard"" by LG Arts Center from Korea. I saw the show myself and it is wonderful. But this is just the start. The powerful rhythms of Japanese Taiko drumming, the passionate tango from Argentina, and the vibrant music and dance from Africa await you. And today, the Asian Ethnic Cultural Performances+ will unveil the legendary sounds of classical and folk music from different regions.

None of this would be possible without our incredible partners. I would like to express my heartfelt and deepest gratitude to the Consuls-General, and representatives of overseas cultural organisations here in Hong Kong. Thank you for your stalwart support for contributing such wonderful programmes. I wish you all a delightful afternoon and a truly rewarding cultural feast.

Finally, as we celebrate our cultural vibrancy, let us also remember our civic duty. I sincerely encourage all registered voters to cast your vote in the upcoming Legislative Council General Election on December 7. Let us elect a new term of responsible, visionary and capable legislators.

Thank you, and enjoy the Festival!"
水務署密切跟進太古城供水事件,2025-11-16 14:23,2025-11-16 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600356.htm,"就太古城部分樓宇用戶食水出現黑點，水務署發言人今日（十一月十六日）表示，署方正密切跟進事件，自昨晚（十一月十五日）接獲太古城管理處通知，指有住戶（主要來自第四及第五期）反映食水內出現少量黑色微粒，隨即派員到場調查，並於涉事住戶及大廈內部供水系統，包括天台及地下食水貯水缸內抽取食水樣本作化驗，現正等候化驗結果。根據以往經驗，相信食水中的黑色沉積物為用於水管塗層的瀝青。
