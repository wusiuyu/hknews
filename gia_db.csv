天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-07 06:46,2026-01-07 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010600836.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月七日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-07 06:46,2026-01-07 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010600834.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 7) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

The CFS has earlier conducted immediate follow-up investigation, contacted local importers (including Nestlé Hong Kong Limited (Nestlé HK)), retailers and relevant authorities. According to the latest information from Nestlé HK today, 21 batches of its powdered infant and young children formula imported into Hong Kong might have used the raw material concerned. As a precautionary measure, Nestlé HK has voluntarily stopped sales, removed from shelves the affected products and has initiated a precautionary recall.

  Please refer to the Annex for product details of the 21 concerned batches of powdered infant and young children formula.

  A spokesman for the CFS said, ""Nestlé HK has initiated a recall of the affected batches of the products concerned. For enquiries about the recall, members of the public may call its hotline at 2599 8874.""

  The CFS, through its Food Incident Surveillance System, noted earlier that certain batches of Nestlé powdered infant formula were being voluntarily recalled in Europe due to possible contamination with Bacillus cereus. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS has immediately initiated follow up actions, published food incident posts to inform the public and the trade about the issue, and has been actively following up on the incident and enhanced surveillance.

  Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Cereulide is a heat-stable toxin produced in food by some strains of Bacillus cereus. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus or its heat-stable toxins may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

  The spokesman urged members of the public not to let infants and young children consume the affected batches of the products, and to seek medical treatment for infants or young children who felt unwell after taking the products concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batches of the products immediately.

  ""The CFS has alerted the trade and relevant department over the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. Follow-up work is ongoing,"" the spokesman said."
民政及青年事務局局長就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒答問內容（附短片）,2026-01-06 22:08,2026-01-06 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600745.htm,"民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（一月六日）就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒。以下是麥美娟的答問內容：

記者：局長你好，今早區議會有多名區議員反映希望當局可以盡快落實一個長遠的安置方案。其實當局有沒有時間表？方案會何時出爐？第二，民政署稱現時正檢討《建築物管理條例》，檢討方向會否包括授權票及會否擴大當局可介入的法團權力？

民青局局長：關於今早大埔區議會會議，我們都聽到區議員就着宏福苑居民的關注，包括希望能夠盡快有一個長期的安置方案。我也留意到議員表達的意見，包括希望長期的安置方案能夠盡快公布、盡快實施，不要讓居民等太久，也希望在原區找到合適的地方。他們也有提到，關於現時大埔宏福苑支援基金（大埔宏福苑援助基金）究竟是否足以應付重置方案的安排，希望政府能夠投入資源。其實在區議會會議前後，我們已將區議員的意見轉達給財政司副司長。相信副司長領導的小組也會考慮區議員所表達的居民意見和意願，盡快為居民提出一些方案。

至於《建築物管理條例》，正如我多次提到，如果大家有印象，在十多二十年前社會已開始討論《建築物管理條例》的各項修訂，但是過去十年都停留在討論階段。今屆政府銳意改善大廈管理的質素，所以我們馬上將討論了很久但一直未能付諸實行的法律修訂，在二○二三／二四年提交立法會討論，並在二○二四年得到立法會的支持，而有關的修訂也在二○二五年獲得通過生效。

就一些屋苑的大維修工程，如果每戶牽涉的金額超過三萬元以上，我們要求業主親身出席會議，並規定百分之十的業主親自出席會議。在二○二五年生效的《建築物管理條例》修訂中也提到關於利益申報，包括無論是管理公司或法團管委會成員，在任何招標過程中需申報牽涉的關係。二○二四年當時在立法會通過修例，我們已在立法會清楚表明《建築物管理條例》的修訂會繼續進行。我們會在新一屆立法會上任後，盡快提交《建築物管理條例》中建議的修訂，尤其在過去一段時間，看到很多法團召開會議或處理合約時，都會遇到一些具體問題，而現行《條例》未能詳細涵蓋。所以希望在立法會討論建議修訂那些條例，讓業主更清晰的「有例可依」，知道如何處理維修工程、採購工作或業主大會的流程。

剛才你提到的授權書處理等，都會提交立法會討論，也希望屆時聽取立法會議員的意見。《行政長官2025年施政報告》中特別提到，除了繼續檢視現行《建築物管理條例》第344章轄下需要修訂的地方外，也會在十八區區議會成立工作小組，即是今日大家在大埔區議會看到，除了大埔區議會，有幾個區議會亦已成立大廈管理工作小組，目的是希望聽取業主或業主立案法團在實際執行時遇到的具體問題，研究如何透過修訂《條例》，更好地發揮法團管委會的作用或工作。我們也希望透過工作小組，加強對業主的宣傳教育，令業主知道在屋苑進行大型維修工程時需要注意和關注甚麼，從而提升業主參與管理工作的能力，提高大廈管理的質素。

記者：想請問一下，今天也有見到有人說住在青年宿舍被人趕走，首先請局長可否釐清一下有沒有這樣的事情？還有過渡性房屋方面其實準備好了沒有？如果準備好了的話，安排是怎樣？如果還未準備好的話，青年宿舍那邊會不會可以延長他們的居住期，直至到居民可以上樓為止？

民青局局長：為了令到宏福苑的居民，在短暫的住宿能夠得到適當的安排，其實在十一月二十六日火警發生之後的一兩天，我們已經立刻透過酒店業界和青年宿舍，去找一些緊急的宿位安排給居民，可以有一個較好的地方休息和暫住。我們也在這個過程透過房屋局，找到差不多2 000個過渡性房屋，或者是房協的屋宇單位，給受影響的居民作為一個較長時期的、一個中期的住宿安排。

在過去一段時間，有居民，無論是留在酒店，又或者在青年宿舍，他們也知道這是一個短暫的住宿，但是可能他們尚未找到一個合適的地方作中期的安置，所以他們仍然留在原本的應急住宿。其實一開始的應急住宿大概是提供十四天，即是兩個星期。大家都看到，酒店業界亦好，青年宿舍的營運者亦好，他們都很好，將期限一路延長。我們也在十二月十八日推出了一個業主租金補助，這個業主租金補助是每年15萬，到現在，在宏福苑受影響的業主裏面，已經有超過1 400戶拿了這個租金補助。每年15萬的意思即是每個月大概有12,500元，雖然這名字是租金補助，但我們都沒有要求需要有租約才可以拿到租金補助，因為我們都是希望可以協助業主，解決中期的住宿問題。如果有些業主可能搬去與家人同住，他仍然可以領取這個租金補助。如果有些業主住在過渡屋，租金大約是3,000至4,000元，如果他領取了每月的12,500元的租金補助之後，其實仍然可以自己保留剩下的餘額，作為他們其他的生活開支。

所以在一些酒店也好，或者在青年宿舍的那些短期住宿，我們都需要協助居民過渡去一些中期的住宿安排。所以我們都看到青年宿舍、酒店一直陸陸續續有居民過渡去一些中期住宿，有些可能是在過渡屋，或者是房協的房屋，又或者他們在外面市場租屋。那麼在青年宿舍裏面，也都有居民選擇在外面租屋，又或者過渡了去過渡屋。當然也知道有些人需要更長時間留在青年宿舍，因為他們需要更長時間去找到適合的地方作為中期的住宿安排。青年宿舍的營運者亦講得很清楚，他們會按實際的情況去酌情處理這些個案。如果有一些仍然逗留在青年宿舍的住戶，因為在短時間未能夠找到中期的住宿，事實上青年宿舍的營運者有協助居民去找一些合適的中期住宿安排，亦為他們提供不同的協助。我們務求能夠做到每一個個案都可以按實際的情況能夠酌情處理，去為居民提供一個妥善的安排。

記者：想問現在法庭說合安管理公司不太適宜向土地審裁處提交報告，局方會否有其他方法申請新增去監管合安管理公司呢？還有想問，政府選擇合安管理公司的時候，有沒有諮詢過居民？雖然法團沒有提交反對通知書，但這段期間，局方有沒有收到居民有反對合安管理公司成為管理人的意見？

民青局局長：首先，在法庭我們本來為了合安（合安管理有限公司）的工作能夠令到大家有所監管，我們建議合安除了向民政事務總署提交每月的報告外，可以向土地審裁處提交季度報告。但是因為法庭在《建築物管理條例》下沒有角色去處理他們的報告，即他們是中立的角色，所以他們認為不需要向法庭提交報告。

但第一，合安作為持牌物管公司，每一間香港的持牌物業管理公司，都是受到物業管理監管局的條例、良好的作業指引和守則監管。如果他們違反這些要求或法例，物監局會做一些紀律的聆訊，包括他們要妥善處理文件，或協助法團做管理工作等。

另外，正如我剛才所說，民政事務總署亦會成立一個專班，協助委任管理人，即是合安，進行管理好宏福苑的工作。合安亦會每月向民政事務總署提交報告。同時，合安會在未來的日子安排不同的簡介會，令到居民更理解和了解合安作為管理人的角色和工作，亦會聽取居民的意見。

我們這次是引用《建築物管理條例》第31條提出的申請，這是符合法例的申請。這次的申請不是一個行政工作，而是一個根據法律而作出的申請。為甚麼我們要委任合安這間管理公司呢？其實我們是需要向法庭解釋的。為甚麼它是一個fit and proper 合適的委任管理人呢？正如我們向法庭解釋，第一，它是一間富經驗，已在香港業界營運數十年的一間持牌物業管理公司。第二，它的規模足以應付有關屋苑的管理需要。它不但具備持牌資格，亦擁有多名持牌管理人員，因為一間物業管理公司並非只有公司本身需要領牌，其職員同樣須為持牌人士。所以它有足夠的持牌人和專業團隊應付現在接管業主立案法團管委會的工作後，一些很繁複的法律和各項專業的要求。

另外，這間公司願意無償，即pro bono去工作，同時也得到龔如心慈善信託同意捐款，令到委任管理人的工作不需要為業主增加額外的經濟負擔，即是簡單來說，業主不用付款，由一些專業人士幫他們管理好複雜的文件、合約等等。

我們向法庭遞交申請的時候，已經陳述理據，為甚麼我們認為合安是一間合適讓我們委任成為管理人的公司。法庭最後也接納了我們的理據，亦同意委任合安成為管理人。

記者︰據現屆宏福苑法團的工作報告，顯示現時宏福苑的賬戶存款有一億多，還有一個保證金，與宏業簽署的，是今年七月到期的，想問一下合安會如何處理相關的財務安排，例如存款會歸去哪裏？會否發放給居民呢？第二，想問資訊透明度，剛才局長提到合安可能會舉辦相關的簡介會和安排交通，但居民現時都在不同地方，想問一下會否設立一些專題網站，或合安向政府提交報告時，報告會否公開予居民？

民青局局長︰你說的其實是很多居民想知的，這正正是社會大眾很想保護宏福苑居民的原因，亦是為何政府這次要引用《建築物管理條例》第31條向土地審裁處作出這個申請，無論大家說看以前的文件有這個合約、戶口有多少錢，但現在我們要真真正正、確確實實，究竟這個法團還簽了多少不同合約。大家知道一個法團除了是現在大家都關注的大維修合約外，作為一個普通的屋苑管理，會有很多不同的服務合約，包括電梯、消防、園藝、清潔和保安等。這些合約何時到期呢？條款是甚麼呢？在不同戶口內究竟現時有多少款項呢？進行大維修工程時，他們簽了例如保證金等，這些文件正正是我們為何需要透過這個申請，解散現屆法團的管委會，然後由一個委任管理人，可以向被解散的法團管委會和前管理公司得到這些文件。

合安有幾項很關鍵的工作要做，第一個，就是要跟這些前管理公司進行交接，接收對方現時持有各項與法團相關的文件，包括他們簽訂的合約和銀行賬戶。在收到這些資料後，合安需要聘請專業人士，可能是律師或會計師，協助他們釐清在這些不同的合約中，宏福苑業主或法團的法律責任。釐清這些責任後，這些資訊一定要讓業主知道，剛才我多次強調，這次行動我們沒有取代業主，我們現時做的是，合安可以透過法庭給予的委任，可以向前管理公司和被解散的法團管委會接收這些文件，看這些合約，釐清各項資料，然後告知宏福苑居民，讓他們清楚知道下一步應該怎麼做決定，因為他們可能有法律工作要做、合約要解除等，都要由業主做決定。當要開業主大會時，都需要讓業主有足夠的資料，才可以在開業主大會時作出一個充分的決定。

​剛才你所提及的，我們也考慮到怎樣可以將這些資訊給業主，所以合安幾個關鍵的工作中，其中一個是要進行簡介會。居民現時可能住在不同地方，我們可能在不同地點，多居民住、方便居民的地方進行簡介會，讓居民知道這些資訊，讓他們有充足的資訊。現時大家可能是聽人說、看群組，我們首要工作是接收這些文件後，再找專業人士協助看清楚，釐清不同合約的法律責任或帳目，令業主對整件事更清晰。

食安中心呼籲市民不要食用個別批次的嬰幼兒配方奶粉,2026-01-06 21:13,2026-01-06 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600728.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（一月六日）表示，中心持續積極跟進雀巢公司在歐洲部分地區自願預防性回收個別批次的嬰幼兒配方奶粉，因為個別原材料可能存在源自微生物蠟樣芽孢桿菌（Bacillus cereus）的物質。中心早前已即時作出跟進調查，聯絡本地進口商（包括雀巢香港有限公司（雀巢香港））、零售商及有關當局，根據雀巢香港今日的最新資料，其進口本港的嬰幼兒配方奶粉有21個批次亦可能曾使用相關原材料，為審慎起見，雀巢香港已自願將受影響產品停售和下架，並展開預防性的回收。

相關21個批次的嬰幼兒配方奶粉的詳細產品資料，請參閱附件。

中心發言人說：「雀巢香港現正回收受影響批次產品，市民可於辦公時間致電其熱線2599 8874，查詢有關產品的回收事宜。」

中心早前透過食物事故監測系統，得悉雀巢公司在歐洲自願回收部分批次的雀巢嬰兒配方奶粉，因為懷疑個別產品可能受到蠟樣芽孢桿菌污染。中心得悉事件後，已即時作出跟進，並發布食物事故報表，讓公眾和業界知悉有關事件，並一直積極跟進事件和加強抽檢。

蠟樣芽孢桿菌普遍存在於環境中。如製作或貯存食品的過程欠缺衞生，可引致該菌繁殖。致吐毒素是由一些蠟樣芽孢桿菌菌株在食物中產生的耐熱毒素。進食含過量蠟樣芽孢桿菌或其耐熱毒素的食物，可能引致腸胃不適，例如嘔吐及腹瀉。

發言人呼籲市民不要讓嬰幼兒食用受影響批次的產品，如發覺嬰幼兒食用有關產品後不適，應盡快求醫。業界亦應立即停止使用或出售受影響批次產品。

發言人說：「中心已就事件通知業界及相關部門，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。跟進工作仍然繼續。」"

Reporter: Can you recap in English the Government's expectations towards the new management company? What does it signify in the Lands Tribunal's decision? And what's next after the company replacement? And what about the rehousing plan for the residents and any Government's plan on how and when to rehouse them permanently?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: The Government welcomes the decision of the Lands Tribunal to dissolve the management committee of the Wang Fuk Court, The Incorporated Owners Of Wang Fuk Court, and appoint Hop On Management as the administrator. We all can see and understand that the management committee of Wang Fuk Court is plainly unable to carry out its duties under the DMC (Deed of Mutual Covenant) and the BMO (Building Management Ordinance) to competently manage Wang Fuk Court in an unprecedented circumstance now faced by the owners. So, the Government applied to the Lands Tribunal last month and the Lands Tribunal granted the approval to appoint a professional administrator to help the Wang Fuk Court residents to properly and competently manage the Wang Fuk Court.

The Nina Wang Charity Trustees has also agreed to make a donation of 10 million dollars to support the operation expenses or costs that the administrator may incur when they appoint other professionals to look into the various accounts or contracts of the Wang Fuk Court. So, we hope that with the assistance from the professionals and the professional PMC (property management company), that is Hop On Management Company, residents of the Wang Fuk Court, their welfare and benefits can be properly and legally safeguarded.

As for the rehousing plan, as you all know, the Deputy Financial Secretary is leading a special task force to look into this, we expect that he will listen to views from the residents and to announce any options or proposals for the residents to consider.

管理人僅是暫代原管委會的職能，代表法團處理屋苑管理事務。法團作為依法成立的法人仍然存在。相關委任並不會影響宏福苑業主對重要屋苑管理事務的最終決定權，所有重大決定均須嚴格按照《建管條例》的規定，透過召開業主大會由業主決定，以確保業主的權利得到充分尊重。

在完成委任程序後，合安將立即展開工作，包括與前管理公司進行交接，釐清在法團已簽訂的合約下法團及業主的法律責任及權益，以及查明法團的賬目情況。與此同時，合安亦會開始籌備舉辦簡介會，向業主及居民說明其作為管理人的角色與職責，並收集他們的意見與訴求，確保居民對管理安排有充分了解和參與。民政事務總署亦會派員出席。

Lands Tribunal grants Government application and appoints administrator to take over management of Wang Fuk Court,2026-01-06 20:16,2026-01-06 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600687.htm,"​The Lands Tribunal today (January 6) ruled on the Government's application made under section 31 of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) (BMO). It formally approved the dissolution of the incumbent management committee (MC) of the Wang Fuk Court (WFC) owners' corporation (OC) and appointed Hop On Management Company Limited (Hop On) under the Chinachem Group as the administrator of the estate. The judge also agreed with the Government's submission that there are limitations in the capabilities of the current MC, whereas Hop On possesses sufficient experience and resources to provide appropriate assistance.The Government welcomes the Land Tribunal's decision.The Government believes that having a professional team take over the management of the OC can more effectively handle the complex issues currently faced by the OC and better safeguard the rights and interests of all owners and residents.

The administrator will only temporarily assume the functions of the original MC, acting on behalf of the OC to handle management matters of the estate. The OC as a statutory body established under the law will continue to exist. The appointment will not affect the ultimate decision-making power of WFC owners on important management matters. All major decisions must strictly follow the provisions of the BMO, to be decided by owners through resolutions passed at owners' meetings, ensuring that owners' rights are fully respected.

Upon completion of the appointment procedures, Hop On will commence work immediately. This includes conducting a handover with the former management company, clarifying the legal liabilities and entitlements of the OC and the owners under contracts already entered into by the OC, and examining the accounts of the OC. Meanwhile, Hop On will also start preparing to hold briefing sessions to explain to owners and residents its role and duties as the administrator, and to collect their views and requests, ensuring residents have sufficient understanding of and participation in the management arrangements. Staff from the Home Affairs Department (HAD) will also attend.

The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, said, ""To ensure the orderly progress of various tasks, HAD has established a dedicated follow-up team, which will work closely with Hop On and provide necessary support. In accordance with the court order, Hop On is required to submit monthly reports to the Government.""

Miss Mak reiterated, ""The administrator will not charge any fees for this appointment. Nina Wang Charity Management Limitedhas also pledged to donate a total of $10 million (representing an additional $5 million on top of the earlier announced donation) to cover the administrator's day-to-day operational expenses.""

Miss Mak pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government pledges to continue to walk with residents, provide necessary assistance, and work together with all sectors of the community to help WFC residents overcome the current difficulties."""

民政及青年事務局局長就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2026-01-06 19:40,2026-01-06 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600678.htm,"​民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（一月六日）下午就大埔宏福苑管理事宜會見傳媒的談話內容：

各位，土地審裁處今日就政府引用《建築物管理條例》（第344章）（《建管條例》）第31條申請作出裁決，正式批准解散現有宏福苑業主立案法團（法團）的管理委員會（管委會），並委任華懋集團旗下的合安管理有限公司為委任管理人。法庭亦認為現任管委會確實在能力上有所局限，而合安則擁有充足的經驗和資源，能夠提供恰當的協助。

政府歡迎土地審裁處的決定。這次裁決標誌着宏福苑的管理工作將由專業的團隊接手。合安在本地物業管理行業擁有長期經驗與充足資源，能夠在緊急情況下迅速動員，以系統化、專業化的方式處理當前複雜而緊迫的屋苑管理事務，切實保障全體業主和居民的合法權益與福祉。

有關的申請是在二○二五年十二月十九日向土地審裁處提交的。當日我在會見傳媒時指出，政府了解宏福苑在火災後所面對的管理問題極其複雜，當中涉及多項技術、法律及財政考量，已超出一般法團管委會所能處理的範疇。與此同時，管委會成員在艱難時期亦需兼顧自身家庭的需要，而政府亦接獲不少居民明確表達期望政府介入協助的訴求。因此，政府引用《建管條例》第31條，向土地審裁處提交申請，解散宏福苑法團的管委會，並委任合安為管理人。

我要強調，管理人僅是暫代原管委會的職能，代表法團處理屋苑管理事務。法團作為依法成立的法人仍然存在。相關申請並不會影響宏福苑業主對重要屋苑管理事務的最終決定權，所有重大決定均須嚴格按照《建管條例》的規定，透過召開業主大會由業主決定，確保業主的權利得到充分尊重。

管理人僅是暫代原管委會的職能，在完成必要的委任程序後，合安將履行在《建管條例》下管委會的職能，展開一系列關鍵工作，包括首先立即與前管理公司進行交接，接收由對方持有的各項與法團相關的文件，包括由法團簽訂的合約，例如大維修及屋苑其他服務相關的合約。合安在收到相關資料後，其聘請的專業顧問或專業人士會先進行詳細分析，釐清法團及業主的法律責任及權益。在採取下一步行動，例如終止相關合約前，合安會確保與業主有充分溝通。其次，合安亦會聘用專業人士協助查明法團的帳目情況。同時，為確保資訊流通，合安會設立溝通渠道，當中包括開始籌備舉辦簡介會，向業主及居民介紹作為管理人的角色及職能，並收集業主及居民的意見等，以了解他們就大廈管理方面的需要及訴求，確保他們對現況能夠有充分掌握。我們會視乎現時居民臨時住所的位置，舉行簡介會以方便居民。

未來，所有涉及大廈管理的重大建議與決策，均會透過適切方式諮詢居民意見，確保過程公開透明。所以大家可以放心，合安作為一間專業物業管理公司，當行使管理人的權力及履行職責時，一定會按《建管條例》要求，亦會與業主及住戶保持緊密溝通，並以維護所有業主共同權益為出發點。

我要藉此機會重申，管理人在今次委任中不會收取宏福苑業主任何費用。龔如心慈善管理有限公司，即龔如心慈善信託亦承諾會捐出合共1,000萬元，即與較早前十二月宣布的500萬元再增加金額至1,000萬元，以支付管理人的日常運作開支，包括相關專業服務的費用。管理人亦只是取代了法團管委會，代表業主立案法團處理屋苑的管理事務。當有重大決定需要作出時，管理人會按《建管條例》的規定召開業主大會，由業主透過投票作出決定。透過龔如心慈善信託的捐款，免卻了宏福苑業主的財政負擔，令合安可聘請專業人士審查各項帳目和釐清不同合約的法律責任。

為確保上述工作能有序推進，民政事務總署（民政總署）會成立專班，聯同合安密切跟進上述的各項工作。根據法庭命令，合安需每月向政府提交報告。民政總署會確保合安依據《建管條例》行事，竭盡所能履行管理人的職責，並會提供充分協助，與居民一起突破現時困局。"
衞生防護中心調查一宗進食牛肝菌後食物中毒個案群組,2026-01-06 19:30,2026-01-06 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600657.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月六日）正調查一宗進食牛肝菌後食物中毒的個案群組，並呼籲市民向信譽良好和可靠的店鋪購買菇類。

個案群組涉及兩人，包括一名59歲男子和一名28歲女子。二人於去年十二月二十一日在家自行烹煮和進食牛肝菌，約兩小時後出現噁心、嘔吐、腹痛、腹瀉和發燒徵狀，同日到威爾斯親王醫院急症室求診，經治療後已出院。

根據患者的臨床徵狀，中心相信他們因進食牛肝菌而出現食物中毒。病人提供的同一批次未經烹煮的牛肝菌樣本經鑑定後，證實屬有毒菇類，含一些經烹煮後仍能導致食用人士腸道不適的物質。

中心的初步調查顯示，涉事的牛肝菌是其中一名病人去年十二月於雲南省購買，產品包裝上沒有標示商標及來源地資料。

中心已將個案通報中國內地相關當局，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動，以保障市民健康。

進食菇類引致的食物中毒一般為急性。病徵通常包括進食後短時間內出現噁心、嘔吐和腹痛等腸道徵狀。因應不同的菇種，病人亦可能出現如大量流汗、幻覺或其他神經系統病徵和肝衰竭。病人可能會昏迷，嚴重者更可引致死亡。如懷疑因進食菇類引致食物中毒，亦應立即求醫。如有剩餘菇菌，應帶同前往求醫，以供辨識種類。

不論於本地或外地選購或食用菇類時，市民亦應注意以下事項：


向信譽良好和可靠的店鋪購買菇類，不要購買懷疑混雜了不明品種的菇類；
不要購買不衞生的菇類，例如沾有栽培物料或出現有色斑點／發出異味／釋出黏糊液等變壞現象；
切勿自行採摘野生菇類進食，因為市民難於辨別野生菇類是否適宜食用；及
徹底清洗及煮熟才進食。

CHP investigates cluster of food poisoning after consumption of porcini mushrooms,2026-01-06 19:30,2026-01-06 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600661.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (January 6) investigating a cluster of food poisoning cases after consumption of porcini mushrooms. The public is urged to buy mushrooms from reputable and reliable stores.

The cluster involves a 59-year-old male and a 28-year-old female. Approximately two hours after cooking and consuming porcini mushrooms at home on December 21 last year, they presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and fever. They sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince of Wales Hospital on the same day and were subsequently discharged after treatment.

Based on their clinical symptoms, the CHP believed that the patients' food poisoning was caused by consuming porcini mushrooms. Samples of uncooked porcini mushroom from the same batch provided by a patient was confirmed to be a poisonous mushroom species containing certain gastrointestinal irritants that can remain even after being cooked.

Preliminary investigations revealed that one of the patients bought the porcini mushroom concerned from Yunnan Province last December. The product did not have a trademark and information about the place of origin.

The CHP has reported the case to the relevant authority of the Chinese Mainland, and will continue to follow up on the case and take appropriate action to safeguard public health.

Mushroom poisoning is generally acute. Common presentations include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain appearing shortly after ingestion. Depending on the mushroom species, patients may also have other symptoms such as profuse sweating, hallucinations, other neurological symptoms, as well as liver failure. The patient could go into a coma. Death may result in severe cases. If mushroom poisoning is suspected, the patient should seek immediate medical attention and bring along any available remnant for identification.

Members of the public are recommended to take note of the following when choosing or consuming mushrooms locally or overseas:


Buy mushrooms from reputable and reliable suppliers, and do notbuy mushroom products which may be mixed with unknown species;
Do not buy mushrooms which look unhygienic, such as those with growing substrates left with the product, or those which show signs of spoilage such as coloured spots/abnormal smell/slime, etc;
Do not pick wild mushrooms for consumption as it is difficult to distinguish edible mushroom species from inedible ones; and
Wash and cook mushrooms thoroughly before consumption.

Immigration Department arrested 20 persons during operations targeting foreign domestic helpers who breached conditions of stay (with photos),2026-01-06 19:15,2026-01-06 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600641.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Swordfish"" for four consecutive days from January 3 to 6, targeting foreign domestic helpers (helper) who breached their conditions of stay. A total of 20 persons, including 12 suspected illegal workers or overstayers and eight suspected employers or persons involved, were arrested.

​  During the operations, ImmD investigators raided 42 target locations, including restaurants, retail shops, food factories, guesthouses, and commercial building and residential building units. The arrested suspected illegal workers or overstayers comprised three men and nine women, aged 24 to 60. Among them, one person was a current helper, two persons were overstaying ex-helpers, three persons were holders of recognizance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong, one person was visitor, and five persons were overstaying visitors. ImmD investigators found most of the suspected illegal workers in restaurants, a guesthouse and a food factory performing dishwashing, cleaning, kitchen duties, food productionand processing duties, etc. Meanwhile, eight suspected employers or persons involved, comprising seven men and one woman aged 30 to 68, included persons who were in charge of the companies or restaurants involved and were suspected of employing the suspected illegal workers.

​  ""A helper should only perform domestic duties for the employer as listed in the 'Schedule of Accommodation and Domestic Duties' attached to the Contract. The helper should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employer should not require or allow the helper to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

​  The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

​  The spokesman warned that, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

​  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

​  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

​  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

​  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
入境處打擊外傭違反逗留條件拘二十人（附圖）,2026-01-06 19:15,2026-01-06 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600640.htm,"  入境事務處（入境處）於一月三日至一月六日一連四日在全港各區展開代號「劍魚」的反非法勞工行動。在該項打擊外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在港違反逗留條件的行動中，入境處共拘捕二十名人士，包括十二名懷疑非法勞工或逾期逗留人士，及八名涉嫌聘用非法勞工或涉案人士。

  行動中，入境處人員一共搜查了四十二個目標地點，包括餐廳、零售店舖、食物製造廠、賓館、商業大廈及住宅大廈單位等。被捕的懷疑非法勞工或逾期逗留人士分別為三男九女，年齡介乎二十四至六十歲。當中一名為現職外傭、兩名為逾期逗留的前外傭、三名為持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）人士、一名訪港旅客以及五名逾期逗留的訪港旅客。被捕的非法勞工主要在餐廳、賓館及食物製造廠從事不同工作，包括洗碗、清潔、廚房雜工、食品生產及加工等工作。而因涉嫌聘用非法勞工或涉案被捕的八名人士分別為七男一女，年齡介乎三十至六十八歲，他們均為涉案公司或餐廳東主及負責人等。

  入境處發言人說：「外傭只能根據合約附錄的「住宿及家務安排」為僱主料理家務。外傭不得受僱於其他人士擔任任何職務，包括兼職家務工作。僱主亦不得要求或容許傭工為其他人士擔任任何工作。」

  入境處發言人強調：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

  此外，入境處發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

  發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰會由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

  根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

  入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

  Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 53, at Hong Kong International Airport on January 5. About 5 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $22,000 and a duty potential of about $18,000 were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

  Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

為使公眾人士認識完稅標籤制度，海關在先導計劃期間進行了一系列宣傳工作，包括通過海關網頁、社交媒體和新聞公報發放有關資訊。海關亦於所有邊境口岸管制站、香港國際機場及公共屋邨，展示宣傳海報，派發資料單張及在個別地區設置流動宣傳攤位。此外，海關亦為各持份者舉行了多場簡報會，務求向不同界別的人士提供更多關於完稅標籤制度及先導計劃的詳情。

海關一直積極與煙草業界及相關持分者保持緊密溝通，繼於去年十月中與煙草業界和連鎖便利店代表會面及介紹先導計劃的內容後，於同年十二月上旬透過海關的應課稅品顧客聯絡小組、煙草事務的關注組織及報販業的協會等召集其成員舉行了兩場講解會，合共有42位代表出席，當中包括本地香煙生產商及進口商、海外香煙生產商及報販業的代表等。海關於會上向與會者講解先導計劃的內容及目標、已測試完稅標籤申請流程及數據資訊，並即場解答與會者的提問，煙草業界對海關發放的資料反應正面。海關於會後亦派發問卷收集業界意見及發放試行完稅標籤樣本予與會者作參考或測試之用。

業界的意見仍在收集中，海關會在總結測試的經驗及檢視業界意見後，與技術顧問研究持續優化完稅標籤制度的設計，包括申請完稅標籤的程序、附貼的要求及檢測儀器的安裝和設計等。海關會持續透過不同途徑向煙草零售業界發放資訊。海關藉此呼籲業界人士踴躍參與海關舉辦的宣講會。如有疑問，可直接向海關作出查詢。

海關計劃於今年第四季實施首階段的完稅標籤制度並於二○二七年第二季全面推行有關制度，期望有效區分已完稅和未完稅香煙，打擊「白牌煙」。"
Pilot Run for Duty Stamp System by Hong Kong Customs concludes,2026-01-06 18:05,2026-01-06 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600543.htm,"The three-month Pilot Run for the Duty Stamp System launched by Hong Kong Customs concluded on January 4. The Pilot Run simulated the operational procedures of the Duty Stamp System in a real setting for testing operational procedures and related technologies, monitored the delivery of cigarettes affixed with trial duty stamps throughout the entire supply chain from the manufacturing premises to their sale at retail outlets, and collected views and feedback from various stakeholders.

During the Pilot Run, under the supervision of Customs officers and a technical consultant, local cigarette manufacturers conducted several operations of affixing trial duty stamps. Overall, the affixing operations achieved a successful rate of 99 per cent. Those cigarettes affixed with trial duty stamps have been delivered to various retail outlets for sale after duty payment, including chain convenience stores, newspaper stalls and stores. Customs also arranged distribution of promotional posters, leaflets and questionnaires to all related retail outlets for facilitating a better understanding of the tobacco retail industry and the public on key features of the Pilot Run.

As well, Customs officers affixed trial duty stamps to packets of cigarettes brought into Hong Kong by travellers or imported via small shipments after duty payment at Duty Collection Offices of six border control points and Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) cargo terminals.

As of January 3, Customs collected a total of 504 questionnaire responses from the public. The consolidated views showed that the public expressed positive feedback towards the publicity information of the Pilot Run, the design of the trial duty stamps, and the condition of cigarette retail packets after affixation.

To enhance public awareness of the Duty Stamp System, Customs conducted a series of promotional activities during the Pilot Run, including disseminating relevant information through the Customs website, social media and press releases. Customs also displayed promotional posters, distributed information leaflets at all border control points, HKIA and public housing estates, as well as set up mobile promotional booths in selected districts. In addition, Customs also arranged multiple briefing sessions for stakeholders with the aim of delivering details about the Duty Stamp System and the Pilot Run to different sectors in society.

Customs has been actively maintaining a close communication with the tobacco industry and relevant stakeholders. Following the introduction of the Pilot Run in meetings with representatives from the tobacco industry and chain convenience stores held in mid-October 2025, Customs organised two briefing sessions in early December 2025 and called on members of Customs' Dutiable Commodities Customer Liaison Group, tobacco affairs concern groups and an association of newspaper stalls industry to participate. The two briefing sessions were joined by a total of 42 representatives from local tobacco manufacturers and importers, overseas cigarette manufacturers and the newspaper stalls industry. Apart from providing participants with information on the content and objectives of the Pilot Run, the procedure of stamp application and data flow tested in the Pilot Run, Customs also answered enquires from participants on-site. The tobacco industry held positive views towards the information disseminated by Customs. After the briefing sessions, Customs distributed questionnaires to collect the industry's views, and distributed samples of the trial duty stamp to participants for their reference or testing purposes.

Industry views are still being gathered, Customs will, upon concluding the experience gained in the Pilot Run and examining the feedback collected from the industry, work with the technical consultant to optimise the design of the Duty Stamp System, including the procedures for applying duty stamps, the affixation requirements, and the details regarding installation and design of dedicated devices. Customs will continue to disseminate information to the tobacco retail industry through various channels. Customs takes this opportunity to encourage industry members to participate in briefing sessions organised by Customs and to contact Customs directly with inquiries.

Customs plans to implement the first phase of the Duty Stamp System in the fourth quarter this year, with full implementation in the second quarter of 2027, thus achieving the ultimate goal of effective distinguishment of duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones, and to combat ""cheap whites""."
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-06 17:30,2026-01-06 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600552.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 6), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  ​​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  ​​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

十二月份第六批涵蓋九個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下，大部分地區更為0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十二月共六批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，60個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有四區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
FEHD releases sixth batch of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in December,2026-01-06 17:00,2026-01-06 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010600185.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (January 6) released the sixth batch of gravidtrap indexes and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in December, covering nine survey areas, as follows:

Among the sixth batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas in December, all were below 10 per cent, and most of the areas recorded zero per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

The FEHD has so far released six batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in December 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 60 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. November 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Four other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

​Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由一月五日中午截至今日（一月六日）中午，食安中心已對185個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on January 5 to noon today (January 6), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 185 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 194 187 samples of food imported from Japan (including 125 110 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 43 018 samples of local catch respectively.
