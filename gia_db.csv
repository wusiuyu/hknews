Speaking at the meeting in the morning, Mr Lee pointed out that the Asia-Pacific region is undergoing profound changes, from digital and green transitions to sweeping demographic changes, and that it is essential to grasp the opportunities wrought by these transformative shifts in order to build a future-ready Asia-Pacific.

Mr Lee proposed that APEC member economies must remain steadfast in their commitment to multilateralism, grounded on the principles of inclusivity, equality, and cooperation; leverage the innovative power of AI as a key driver of economic growth; and make good use of APEC as a platform for expanding cooperation, unlocking new and inclusive drivers of growth.

The APEC member economies jointly adopted and issued the 2025 APEC Leaders' Gyeongju Declaration, which addresses the shared opportunities and challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region and expresses support for APEC as an important platform for regional economic cooperation, the strengthening of connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region, and the building of resilient supply chains. Mr Lee looks forward to pursuing practical cooperation with fellow member economies in these areas, working together to advance high-quality economic development in the Asia-Pacific region.

Mr Lee concluded his visit to Korea and will return to Hong Kong tomorrow (November 2)."

政務司司長出席國泰飛躍理想計劃──空中之旅2025致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-11-01 14:22,2025-11-01 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/01/P2025110100380.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十一月一日）出席國泰飛躍理想計劃──空中之旅2025的致辭：

劉凱詩總裁（國泰顧客及商務總裁）、各位嘉賓、各位國泰航空的同事、各位「共創明『Teen』計劃」的學員、各位循道衛理觀塘社會服務處的同學、各位朋友、各位傳媒朋友：

大家好！今日很開心再次來到香港國際機場，與各位一起參加國泰飛躍理想計劃──空中之旅。像剛才總裁所說，我已來了三次，不過我也希望未來有機會可以再來很多次。

首先，我很衷心感謝國泰一直鼎力支持「共創明『Teen』計劃」，為三期計劃合共推薦了超過50名友師，並且精心安排了40多項活動，一共為超過3 600名學員和友師提供航空體驗之旅。除了今天的「空中之旅」外，還有參觀國泰城和不同機場設施的活動，涵蓋國泰餐飲及國泰貨運等不同範疇。這些活動不單只是航空體驗，我相信也是使我們學員更了解一架飛機飛上天空，不只是那麼簡單，背後有很多不同的人、不同的專家一起努力的成果，大家有機會去參觀這些便會知道，單單是總裁剛才所說的簡單餐飲其實也是一個大型的運作。要做到最好，需要很多方面的配合才可以。

各位國泰的友師，很感謝你們對學員的陪伴、指導和分享，這些不但提升學員的自信心，更幫助他們以積極態度規劃未來，為職業生涯打好基礎。你們無私和真誠的付出，正正是「共創明『Teen』計劃」最寶貴的資源。真的很感謝你們！因為我剛開始時經常都很擔心香港不夠友師，原來我是不用擔心的。友師有時候比學員更多。對此我真的很感謝。

香港之所以會成功，我經常認為是因為有很多有心的人，願意出心出力，各位學員真的要好好珍惜這個很好的機會，當自己是「海綿」就可以了，吸收友師給你們的知識，這個非常重要。

今天的「空中之旅」是「國泰飛躍理想計劃」最受期待的年度壓軸盛事，剛才我進來的時候就看見180名青年人面帶笑容，很開心的。其實大家都感受到你們的興奮和期待，相信大家已經急不及待，想盡快開展這次旅程。

我知道好像剛才總裁所說，今天大部分的年青人都是第一次坐飛機的。這絕對會是一趟難忘的經驗！我也鼓勵大家把握機會開拓視野、增長知識、認識多點朋友。但我認為難忘的體驗，還有另一個原因，就是大家將來因為種種原因經常都要坐飛機，但今次這麼特別的航班是從香港飛香港的，我相信你們以後很難有機會再坐了，好好珍惜這一次那麼特別的旅程，很感謝國泰。

展望未來，政府會持續結合社會各界力量，透過政、商、民三方的合作，進一步強化「共創明『Teen』計劃」。我們也得到香港賽馬會的一千萬元慷慨支持，我們會進一步豐富「共創明『Teen』校友會」的活動內容，延續計劃的成效，培育他們成為未來社會的棟樑。

要建設更好的香港，需要我們的積極參與，我也要在此「賣廣告」：十二月七日是立法會選舉投票日，我呼籲在場所有嘉賓，如果你是有資格投票的，當天踴躍投票，選出為香港發展貢獻力量的立法會議員。而各位「共創明『Teen』」的學員，雖然你們應該還未達到投票年齡，但我希望大家從現在開始，多關心社會事務，在將來符合資格時，立即登記成為選民，貢獻自己的一分力量。

各位學員，今日的「空中之旅」，不只是一場活動，更是一次夢想啓航的旅程。我預祝各位享受接下來90分鐘的飛行體驗，希望你們滿載而歸！我也衷心祝願國泰業務蒸蒸日上，繼續與社會攜手並肩，進一步提升香港作為國際航空樞紐的地位。謝謝大家！"

Speech by FS at HKICPA x IFAC SMP Conference (English only) (with photos),2025-11-01 11:55,2025-11-01 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/01/P2025110100300.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the HKICPA x IFAC SMP Conference today (November 1):

Edward (President of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Mr Edward Au), Ms Monica Foerster (Chair of the Small and Medium Practices Advisory Group of the International Federation of Accountants, Ms Monica Foerster), David (Chairman of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council, Dr David Sun), Margaret (Chief Executive & Registrar of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Ms Margaret Chan), fellow members, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you at this important conference, co-organised by the HKICPA (Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants) and the IFAC (the International Federation of Accountants), highlighting the critical role that small and medium practices (SMPs) play—not only in our economies, but also in fostering the trust that underpins our financial system and business environment.

SMPs are an important pillar of the accounting profession across the globe. Known for their adaptability and close client relationship, they serve as trusted service providers and advisors to countless businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs). However, in this era of daunting climate change and rapid technological transformation driven by artificial intelligence and others, how can the accounting profession, especially SMPs, navigate and thrive? And as the momentum of these global transformative forces continue to build up, how can SMPs evolve to seize the emerging opportunities?

These are timely and pertinent questions that this conference will explore. I very much look forward to hearing the insights and perspectives of the distinguished speakers and participants. On this occasion, I would also like to share the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's perspective – including what we are doing both at the macro level and specifically with the accounting sector, to drive digital transformation and sustainability.

Digital transformation

Let me start with digital transformation. In today's age of innovation, few forces are as disruptive and transformative as artificial intelligence. AI is reshaping business models, redefining competitiveness, and revolutionising how we work, communicate and live. Fully recognising its enormous potential, Hong Kong has embraced a twin-engine vision – namely, developing ""AI as a core industry"", and promoting AI as an enabler (i.e. AI+) to transform and upgrade traditional sectors and businesses. Our focus spans six strategic pillars: supercomputing power, algorithm, use case scenarios, data, funding, and talent.

On the regulatory front, we are equally committed to ensuring a sound and supportive governance framework for responsible AI development. For example, in the financial sector, we have issued a policy statement on the ethical and responsible application of AI. It sets out a ""dual track"" approach: promoting adoption while addressing risks such as cybersecurity, data privacy and intellectual property protection.

Like any technologies, AI brings both challenges and opportunities to SMPs. While there are understandable concerns about AI's impact on reduced traditional client assignments and employment, we believe that greater opportunity lies ahead – how SMPs can evolve from traditional compliance-focused roles, into more strategic advisory capacities to support businesses in their transition and sustainable growth.

By leveraging technology to automate routine compilation and analytical processes, SMPs can redirect valuable resources toward higher-value services – such as ESG (environmental, social and governance) advisory and reporting, scenario contemplation, disaster recovery, and cybersecurity assessments. These are areas where their expertise can make a bigger difference.

Upskilling is key. I'm glad to note that here in Hong Kong, the AFRC (Accounting and Financial Reporting Council) and HKICPA have been working to empower SMPs with training and resources to build digital readiness. The Government is fully committed to supporting these capacity-building efforts, and we welcome deeper and broader collaboration with both local and international partners.

Sustainability

The second pillar is sustainability — a global imperative that is transforming business practices, lender perspectives and investor expectations worldwide.

At the macro level, Hong Kong is firmly committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We are advancing on four fronts: net-zero electricity generation, energy efficient, green buildings and transport, and waste reduction.

But our ambition goes further. We aim to establish Hong Kong as an international green technology and green finance hub – serving not only the city but the wider region. Today, Hong Kong is Asia's leader in green and sustainable finance, with over US$80 billion in green and sustainable debt issued last year.

Our green tech ecosystem is also gaining global traction. Yesterday, I returned from a business trip to Saudi Arbia. On this occasion, I led a 40-strong delegation, comprising Hong Kong and Mainland companies engaged in AI and robotics, biotech, fintech, green and sustainable tech, construction technologies, new materials, and more. Several of the tech companies from our delegation signed co-operation agreements or MOUs with local partners to deploy their solutions there.

Ladies and gentlemen, sustainability is no longer optional. It is becoming a must worldwide. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) is setting a new global baseline for corporate disclosure, in response to the growing demand for transparency from investors, regulators and consumers.

In December last year, we launched a roadmap on sustainability disclosure in Hong Kong , which charts a path for major public interest entities to fully adopt the ISSB standards by 2028. The ultimate objective is to provide a unified framework for sustainability reporting aligned with global standards.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has also implemented mandatory climate-related disclosure requirement, aligning with ISSB standards, starting this year. In June, the IFRS Foundation (International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) recognised Hong Kong as one of the first jurisdictions with a clear roadmap toward full adoption of the standards. This underscores our strong commitment to and leadership in enhancing transparency and accountability in capital markets.

For the accounting profession, this represents a significant growth opportunity. More SMEs are being asked by customers, suppliers and lenders to demonstrate their sustainability credentials. Yet, many lack the in-house expertise to measure carbon footprints, design ESG strategies, or even compile data for quality disclosures.

This is where SMPs can step in – with their expert knowledge and credibility, to support SMEs in navigating sustainability compliance and requirements.

To this end, the regulators and industry bodies should continue to strengthen upskilling programmes, issue technical guidance, and foster cross-sectoral collaboration to ensure SMPs are equipped to lead in this growing field of sustainability advisory and assurance.

Concluding Remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, the path ahead requires not just cross-sectoral collaboration but also cross-border co-operation. The challenges we face, whether digital or environmental, are complex. But we have no choice, but to win. For those who are prepared and willing, the opportunities are enormous.

With your support, I am confident that Hong Kong can build a stronger, more innovative, and more sustainable future for the accounting profession and the broader community.

Let me close by wishing you all a fruitful and inspiring conference. May you enjoy good health and continued success in your career in the time ahead. Thank you very much."
Speech by FS at HKICPA x IFAC SMP Conference (English only),2025-11-01 11:55,2025-11-01 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/01/P2025110100300.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the HKICPA X IFAC SMP Conference today (November 1):

Edward (President of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Mr Edward Au), Ms Monica Foerster (Chair of the Small and Medium Practices Advisory Group of the International Federation of Accountants, Ms Monica Foerster), David (Chairman of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council, Dr David Sun), Margaret (Chief Executive & Registrar of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Ms Margaret Chan), fellow members, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you at this important conference, co-organised by the HKICPA (Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants) and the IFAC (the International Federation of Accountants), highlighting the critical role that small and medium practices (SMPs) play—not only in our economies, but also in fostering the trust that underpins our financial system and business environment.

SMPs are an important pillar of the accounting profession across the globe. Known for their adaptability and close client relationship, they serve as trusted service providers and advisors to countless businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs). However, in this era of daunting climate change and rapid technological transformation driven by artificial intelligence and others, how can the accounting profession, especially SMPs, navigate and thrive? And as the momentum of these global transformative forces continue to build up, how can SMPs evolve to seize the emerging opportunities?

These are timely and pertinent questions that this conference will explore. I very much look forward to hearing the insights and perspectives of the distinguished speakers and participants. On this occasion, I would also like to share the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's perspective – including what we are doing both at the macro level and specifically with the accounting sector, to drive digital transformation and sustainability.

尊敬的劉光源副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、容永祺主席（全國政協委員、憲法和香港基本法推介聯席會議主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天我很高興與各位齊聚一堂，出席由憲法和香港基本法推介聯席會議（基推會）主辦的紀念《基本法》頒布三十五周年研討會。

三十五年前，全國人民代表大會正式通過《基本法》這部對香港、國家以至全世界都具有重大意義的法律。《基本法》雖然是憲制性文件，但內容非常豐富、非常實在，條文涵蓋各方各面，把「一國兩制」政策以法律條文具體規定，為香港的長遠發展奠下了堅實基礎。

國家《憲法》與《基本法》共同構成香港特別行政區的憲制秩序，令「一國兩制」這個前無古人的偉大構想得以成功實踐，並取得舉世矚目的成就。「一國兩制」的根本宗旨，在於堅定維護國家主權、安全與發展利益，同時確保香港社會長期繁榮穩定。

在「一國兩制」方針的指引下，香港依法實行高度自治，保持了原有的經濟、社會制度，以及普通法制度。回歸二十八年來，在中央大力支持和特區政府的不斷努力下，香港經濟穩步發展，民生持續改善，在多項國際社會評級中屢創佳績，成績有目共睹。

本屆政府除了歷史性完成《基本法》第二十三條本地立法，全面落實「愛國者治港」原則，完善立法會、區議會選舉制度外，我們在加快融入國家發展大局、鞏固和提升香港競爭優勢等方面都取得了顯著進步。無論是強化香港作為國際金融中心的地位，還是積極打造國際航空樞紐、建設國際創科中心，以至推動香港成為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心、中外文化藝術交流中心等，每一項工作都穩步推進，成果豐碩。

國家主席習近平指出，「一國兩制」具有顯著制度優勢和強大生命力，是保持香港、澳門長期繁榮穩定的好制度，是服務強國建設、民族復興偉業的好制度，是實現不同社會制度和平共處、合作共贏的好制度，必須長期堅持。

《基本法》的誕生和實踐，對世界同樣有深刻的意義。「一國兩制」所蘊含的和平、包容、開放、共享的價值理念，是世界通用的，值得我們共同珍惜與守護。

三十五年來，《基本法》在實踐中不斷豐富和完善，確保「一國兩制」得以全面準確、行穩致遠地貫徹落實。

今天在座嘉賓中，有不少曾參與和見證《基本法》從起草、實施到不斷完善的各界代表。在此，我向你們表達最誠摯的敬意與衷心的感謝！

憲法和香港基本法推介聯席會議多年來一直不遺餘力，深入社區，以多元靈活的方式向廣大市民，特別是青少年和學生群體，推廣《憲法》與《基本法》。我衷心期望基推會能繼續發揮引領作用，啓發更多愛國愛港、了解香港制度優勢的新一代，成為「一國兩制」事業的堅定建設者和可靠接班人。

特區政府亦會繼續透過不同方式，增強社會各界對《憲法》和《基本法》的認識，並繼續推動國家安全教育，培養市民的愛國情懷，當中包括繼續組織各類活動和內地交流考察團，幫助年輕一代更深入了解國家發展大局。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，當然我們提到建設香港、建設國家，我必須要提今年十二月七日，我們將迎來立法會換屆選舉。我趁着這個機會，誠摯鼓勵所有愛國愛港、有志服務市民的朋友，積極爭取提名，盡早於下星期四，十一月六日或之前報名參選。同時，我也呼籲每一位合資格的選民，在十二月七日投票日踴躍投票，選出代表你們、貢獻香港的立法會議員。

展望未來，讓我們繼續同心協力、眾志成城，共同確保《基本法》和「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠，齊心開創國家與香港高質量發展的新篇章。

最後，我祝願今日的研討會取得圓滿成功，在座各位工作順利，身體健康。多謝大家。"

大家好！今日很高興出席新生精神康復會（新生會）60周年啟動禮暨長期服務頒獎禮晚宴，一同慶祝新生會成立一花甲這個重要的里程。

政府高度重視精神健康，對我們來說，精神健康和身體健康同樣重要。透過醫務衞生局、勞工及福利局及相關部門，與非政府組織和社區內持份者之間的協調和合作，我們採用一個綜合模式推廣精神健康，為有精神健康需要人士提供跨專業及跨界別的服務，包括精神健康的促進、預防、及早識別、介入、治療與康復服務，以及社區支援，持續加強全方位精神健康服務。

新生會是政府在推動精神健康上的重要和可靠的夥伴。會方秉承着60年的歷史，以「以人為本、從心關顧」的理念，致力為精神復元人士提供住宿照顧、職業復康、就業培訓、社區及家屬支援等多元化專業服務。現時，會方營運37個社會福利署（社署）津助服務單位，包括15所津助精神復元人士住宿服務單位，提供的宿位超過1 300個，達全港服務總量的三成半。此外，新生會屬下的社會企業發展超過20項，涵蓋餐飲、零售，以至生態旅遊、清潔服務及物業管理等行業，為無數精神復元人士提供就業機會，從而重拾生活的希望，並提升社會對精神健康的關注。

在社區支援及住宿服務方面，社署一直與業界緊密合作，切實回應精神復元人士及有精神健康需要人士的需求，推展多元化的服務。新生會積極獻策創新，助力政府完善服務，攜手推動精神健康服務持續發展。現時，社署在全港設立的24間精神健康綜合社區中心中，有7間是由新生會營辦的「安泰軒」中心，為精神復元人士、有精神健康需要人士及照顧者提供一站式地區支援服務，成效顯著。今年，新生會更獲批和獲資助營辦新的為精神復元人士照顧者而設的家長／親屬資源中心及精神復元人士過渡支援服務，全力配合政府在這方面的工作。

行政長官在今年《施政報告》，提出推行「精神健康推廣大使培訓先導計劃」，透過精神健康綜合社區中心，協同區內社會福利服務單位及其他持份者，動員及培訓精神健康推廣大使，推廣健康生活方式、培養抗逆力、構建關懷同行的支援網絡。我相信新生會亦會全力支持推行這項計劃。此外，《施政報告》亦提出，「健康心靈先導計劃」會由目前三個地區康健中心，擴展至明年合共九個中心，即是增加六個中心，由具備心理學或輔導學學歷背景及訓練的人員，提供免費精神健康評估和安排跟進。

精神健康服務的發展不僅是政府的責任，亦需要社會各界的通力合作，共同營造關愛與支持的環境。就以今個月十一日啟動的「精神健康月」為例，便需要新生會、政府及其他非政府組織，合作舉辦一系列公眾教育活動，促進大眾對身心健康的關注和實踐。

今晚有50多位新生會的成員獲頒發長期服務獎。我向你們送上衷心感謝和祝福，你們在過去10至30年間的努力和奉獻，是有目共睹和極具意義，我深信你們會再接再厲，造福復元人士和有精神健康需要的人士。

最後，我想向社福及醫療界就一件關乎全港市民福祉的大事，作出呼籲。第八屆立法會的選舉將在十二月七日舉行。過去數年清楚顯示，一個有能力、有幹勁、有承擔的立法會，是可以監察和配合行政機關推行大量有利社會經濟發展的法例和政策措施，提升香港的營商環境、國際競爭力和市民的民生福祉。所以，我請大家屆時積極投票，行使法律賦予你的權利，選出最有能力、熱誠和擔當，且才德兼備的候選人，進入立法會服務國家、服務香港和服務你。十二月七日記得投票！多謝大家。"

The FEHD is concerned about two survey areas in Kowloon City District where the gravidtrap indexes have exceeded 10%, indicating that the mosquito prevention and control measures in nearby premises need to be strengthened. The FEHD has stepped up inspections and followed up with the persons responsible for the management of relevant premises. Mosquito breeding was found in nearby residential estates and construction sites, along with damaged facilities that led to accumulation of water. As a result, the FEHD instituted a prosecution and issued seven statutory notices to the relevant property management company in accordance with Section 27 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), requiring the company's responsible person to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. Two prosecutions and five statutory notices were also issued to the contractors of the relevant construction sites. In addition, the FEHD has visited schools, elderly homes and childcare facilities in the surrounding area to provide mosquito prevention and elimination information. New mosquito traps were installed in the schools to enhance mosquito control efforts. These inspections will continue. According to records, the FEHD has initiated a total of 10 prosecutions against contractors in the survey areas and surrounding construction sites for mosquito breeding over the past six months.

The FEHD will hold interdepartmental meetings with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with higher mosquito infestations and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also distribute leaflets and posters, and notify residential estates that have subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together on mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen monitoring of the gravidtrap index in the area to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

The FEHD has so far released seven batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 44 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Eighteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

In response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation, the FEHD has implemented special mechanism to strengthen mosquito control work in areas with a gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, instead of 20 per cent or above under the original mechanism.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-31 21:15,2025-10-31 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100842.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 31), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The confirmed CF case involving a 55-year-old female, with the source of infection yet to be confirmed, is now classified as a locally acquired case.

Latest surveillance data
-------------------------------

The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch has completed genome analysis of the 55-year-old female. The result indicated that the genetic sequence of her viral sample matched with that of first local CF case in Hong Kong (an 82-year-old female living in Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin), confirming both patients share the same source of infection. Based on the epidemiological information for both patients, including their common locations of movement during the incubation periods, the CHP considered that the 55-year-old female more likely acquired the infection in the vicinity of Fung Tak Estate. As her infection and onset of illness occurred prior to the commencement of the Government's ongoing large-scale mosquito control operations, this locally acquired case will not have significant impact to the overall risk assessment.

The CHP has implemented prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, which include providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. If they present with relevant symptoms, the CHP will arrange laboratory testing for them.

 So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 52 confirmed CF cases, including two local cases and 50 imported cases.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for about 9 400 residents through the health consultation booth on the second floor of Fung Tak Shopping Centre, its inquiry hotline and door-to-door visits in Fung Tak Estate. Among them, 37 individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests. Laboratory testing is continuing. As of 5pm today, 34 samples have completed testing and are all negative for the chikungunya virus.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's continuous comprehensive actions on prevention and control of CF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Following the classification of the 55-year-old female as a locally acquired case, CHP officers today paid a visit to the school in Fung Tak Estate where she works, to follow up with the school management once again. It was confirmed that no other staff or students had developed relevant symptoms at the moment. The CHP also reiterated hygiene advice to the school on preventing CF.

In addition, the CHP held the secondonline live seminar last night with doctors explaining the latest situation of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents. The seminar attracted over 13 000 total views.

The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams will continue to contact the residents in the district, disseminate information, and understand and follow up on their health conditions. The CHP has also issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to be vigilant.

In addition, the CHP has set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and the abovementioned health consultation booth. The hotline and health consultation booth will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily to provide assessments to residents with relevant symptoms and answer enquiries relating to CF.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

â
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

食環署關注九龍城區內兩個監察地區的誘蚊器指數高於10%，顯示附近處所的防蚊滅蚊工作需要加強。食環署人員已加強巡查及與相關處所管理人作出跟進，其中發現有附近屋苑及地盤有蚊子滋生，亦有設施損壞導致積水情況，已按香港法例第132章《公眾衞生及市政條例》第27條向屋苑管理公司提出一宗檢控，以及發出七張法定通知書，要求該管理公司負責人必須做好清除蚊子滋生地的工作；亦向相關地盤承辦商分別提出兩宗檢控及發出五張法定通知書。此外，食環署亦到訪附近範圍內的學校、長者院舍和幼兒設施，提供防蚊滅蚊資訊，並在有關學校內設置新型捕蚊器，加強防控蚊患。有關巡查會繼續進行。根據紀錄，在過去半年，食環署在相關監察地區及附近一帶的地盤，就蚊子滋生情況共向地盤承辦商提出10宗檢控。

食環署會舉行跨部門小組會議，聯同有關部門及持份者，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。食環署亦會派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共七批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，44個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有18區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

因應基孔肯雅熱情況，食環署今年實施特別安排，將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

"Eco Expo Asia public day holds premiere ceremony of ""Enchanting China"" season two and interactive session with students (with photos)",2025-10-31 20:05,2025-10-31 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100697.htm,"âThe Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan; member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Convenor of the Working Group on Patriotic Education, Dr Starry Lee; the Chairman of the Environment and Conservation Fund Committee, Dr Eric Cheng; and the Chairman of the Environmental Campaign Committee, Ms Grace Kwok, attended the public day of the 20th Eco Expo Asia and the premiere ceremony of the ""Enchanting China"" season two today (October 31).

In his speech, Mr Tse introduced that the documentary series ""Enchanting China"" season two released this year consists of five episodes. The themes are, namely ""Living Rivers"", ""Pristine Seas and Shores"", ""Sun-kissed Rice Fields"", ""Zero-Carbon Energy"" and ""Green Transportation"". These episodes showcase China's major achievements and technological contributions in environmental protection and green development from different perspectives, fostering patriotism among the younger generation and helping them understand the country's ecological civilisation development practices and progress toward building a beautiful China.

In addition, the Environment and Ecology Bureau is producing the documentary series ""Enchanting Hong Kong"" with a total of five episodes. The first episode, ""Picturesque Bays of Hong Kong"", features the magnificent Mirs Bay, vividly showing how the environment in Hong Kong has improved since its return to the motherland, with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government dedicating great efforts to environmental protection and nature conservation, yielding fruitful results. At the event today, an excerpt from the ""The City of Life"" episode of ""Enchanting Hong Kong"" delicately portrayed how the HKSAR Government balances urban vitality and development needs while protecting lush green environments and biodiversity, transforming Hong Kong into a more liveable and sustainable vibrant city. Mr Tse encouraged the participating student representatives to explore more, cherish the ecological miracles of the country and Hong Kong, and join hands to inject new impetus into sustainable development.

Afterwards, Deputy Director of Environmental Protection Dr Vanessa Au hosted the Environmental Education Interactive Session for Students, during which personnel from the Water Quality Management Division of the Environmental Protection Department shared key points on keeping shorelines clean and raising teenagers' environmental awareness. Dr Au then hosted the ""Exploring Beautiful Campuses"" segment in the interactive session, inviting students to share the most charming aspects of their campuses, design tour routes, and introduce highlights related to environmental protection on campuses. She praised how the campuses cleverly integrate green elements to cultivate students' daily habits of cherishing resources and loving the Earth. She then presented certificates to student representatives to encourage them to turn the public day experience into action, share it with families and friends, and contribute to environmental protection in daily life.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-31 20:00,2025-10-31 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100770.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月三十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。而早前確診基孔肯雅熱但感染源頭有待確定的55歲女子，會被列作本地感染個案。

最新監測數據
———————

中心的公共衞生化驗服務處已完成對該名55歲女子的基因分析工作。結果顯示，她的病毒樣本基因序列，與本港首宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案（一名居於黃大仙鳳德邨的82歲女子）一樣，顯示兩名患者的感染源頭相同。綜合兩人的流行病學資料，包括她們在潛伏期的共通活動地點，中心認為該名55歲女患者較大機會在鳯德邨一帶受到感染。由於她感染和發病日期在政府展開持續大規模控蚊行動之前，這宗本地感染個案不會對整體的風險評估有太大影響。

中心已按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為個案的家居接觸者或共同暴露於感染源頭的人士提供醫學監察及健康建議，如他們出現相關病徵，中心會安排化驗檢測。

本港今年累計錄得52宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案。兩宗屬本地個案，50宗屬輸入個案。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於鳳德商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話及於鳳德邨進行上門探訪，已為約9 400名居民作評估，並已安排37名出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，化驗工作正陸續進行。截至今日下午五時，中心已完成檢驗34名市民的血液樣本，全部對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府繼續全方位防控基孔肯雅熱
——————————————

中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

因應該名55歲女子被列為本地感染個案，中心今日派員到她任職、位於鳳德邨的學校，再次向校方了解情況，並確認目前校內沒有其他師生出現相關病徵，中心亦再次提醒校方有關預防基孔肯雅熱的衞生建議。

另外，中心昨日晚上舉行第二場的網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等，總觀看人次超過13 000。

中心人員和當區關愛隊會繼續聯絡區內居民發放資訊，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心亦已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

另外，中心由十月二十六日起設立熱線（電話：2125 2373）及上述的醫護站，每日由上午九時至下午八時運作，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估和解答市民有關基孔肯雅熱的查詢。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

Mr Eric Sun (Chairman of the Hong Kong Exporters' Association), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good evening. It is a great pleasure to join you tonight for the 70th anniversary of the Hong Kong Exporters' Association.

  As Eric just said, turning 70 is more than a number. It's a story. A story of resilience and innovation. A story of highs and lows over seven decades.

  You have pursued opportunities around the world. You have believed in the power of trade.

  The Association and its members are at the heart of this success. You have helped make Hong Kong a global centre for business.

   And your hard work has delivered real results. Hong Kong is now a world-leading trade hub. We rank first in global air cargo. We are the world's fourth-largest maritime centre.

   Continual upgrading is essential to any business, industry or sector. And I'm pleased to note that the Association has long encouraged local manufacturers and exporters to transform from ""original equipment manufacturing"" to ""original design manufacturing"" and ""original brand manufacturing"".

  The Association has also been active in promoting an innovative culture in Hong Kong.

  Over the years, the ""Hong Kong Smart Design Awards"" and ""Hong Kong Innovation & Invention"", organised by the Association, have brought Hong Kong original designs and I&T products to the international stage. Your goal - helping build Hong Kong into the region's most influential design force - is making a decided difference.

  The Association works closely with the Government, and we're working together to promote industrial and economic diversification - and Hong Kong's high-value-added development.

  Globally, we see challenges. We see tariffs, growing unilateralism and uncertainties.

  But Hong Kong's economy remains steady. Our economy has recorded positive growth for 10 consecutive quarters since 2023, with a year-on-year growth of 3.1 per cent in the second quarter. And our exports have grown for 19 months in a row.

  Ladies and gentlemen, your determined and continuing efforts, together with our country's full support, are showing encouraging results.

  The momentum of our import and export sectors is expected to continue to strengthen. And you can count on the Government to help you, our exporters, and every sector and industry of our economy, in seizing the opportunities on the Mainland and in markets throughout the region and around the world.

  Allow me now, for a moment, to speak about the upcoming Legislative Council election. A strong partnership between the Government and the legislature is key to building a better Hong Kong, and that partnership begins with your vote. I therefore encourage every registered voter here to support this important election and cast your vote on December 7.

  Once again, my warmest congratulations to the Hong Kong Exporters' Association on 70 remarkable years. I know you will enjoy this very special evening. And I look forward to working with you in the coming year and long down the export road.

  Thank you."

15 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-10-31 19:15,2025-10-31 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100691.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Contribute"", joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"" and ""Windsand"", and a joint operation with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department codenamed ""Flabbergast"" from October 24 to yesterday (October 30). A total of 13 suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations including restaurants and renovation flats etc. Thirteen suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised 11 men and two women, aged 27 to 58. A man and a woman, aged 36 and 56, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
反非法勞工行動拘十五人（附圖）,2025-10-31 19:15,2025-10-31 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100688.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月二十四日至昨日（十月三十日）在全港多區展開一系列反非法勞工行動，包括「促進行動」、聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」及「風沙行動」，以及聯同食物及環境衛生署及康樂及文化事務署執行的「驚愕行動」。截至昨日（十月三十日），行動中共拘捕十三名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

反非法勞工行動中，調查人員搜查了多個目標地點，包括餐廳及裝修中單位等，共拘捕十三名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為十一男兩女，年齡介乎二十七至五十八歲。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為一男一女，年齡分別為三十六及五十六歲。

有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"

尊敬的陳旭主任（國務院僑務辦公室主任）、劉光源副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李永勝署理特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署署理特派員）、蔡冠深會長（香港中華總商會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天晚上我很高興出席香港中華總商會125周年會慶晚宴。

中總自從一九○○年成立以來，一直積極推動香港工商業發展和社會進步，見證並參與了香港每一個重要的發展階段。

中總多年來努力不懈，帶領企業不斷創新、拓展機遇，為香港的繁榮穩定，作出了重要貢獻。

作為香港最有影響力的商會之一，中總不僅為企業提供一個優秀的交流平台，更成為香港與內地、乃至國際貿易合作中一個重要的橋樑。

香港憑著「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，一直積極擔當「超級聯繫人」的角色，深化國際交往，發揮內聯外通的功能，吸引越來越多內地和國際企業，借助香港這個平台「走出去」，為本地企業創造更多商機和經濟回報。

現在，內地企業出海步伐明顯加快。不少內地企業希望通過香港進行融資、設立國際總部、財資中心、科研基地，以至供應鏈管理中心等，進一步拓展全球布局。

為進一步支援內地企業經香港出海，我們已經於今月初整合香港的外地辦事處，包括投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局和香港駐內地辦事處，組成一站式平台，成立內地企業出海專班，吸引更多企業選擇香港作為拓展海外業務的首選平台。

在國家的堅實支持下，本屆政府持續推進改革，實施多項發展經濟、改善民生的政策措施。香港在多項國際排名中名列前茅，顯示我們持續保持經濟活力，也反映國際社會對香港的信心和認可。

展望未來，我們將繼續鞏固香港的固有優勢，並發掘新增長點，加快發展北部都會區和建設國際創新科技中心，更好融入國家發展大局。

好像剛才蔡會長所說，立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行。自從二○二一年完善選舉制度以來，香港治理體系更加完善，行政立法高效協作，經濟發展動力不斷增強。

我呼籲中總以及在座各位朋友，全力支持立法會選舉，在十二月七日踴躍投票，讓我們一起選出代表我們的賢能之士，齊心推動經濟發展、改善民生，共建更美好的香港。

我也期望中總與特區政府繼續攜手合作，共同推動本地工商界發展，促進香港繁榮穩定。

最後，我要特別感謝中總贊助今年十月的國慶煙花匯演，讓廣大市民和遊客共享喜悅。在此，我也祝賀中總成立125周年，並祝願中總發展更上一層樓，各位工作順利、身體健康。謝謝大家。"

消防處於四月十七日及三十日先後在葵青區進行打擊非法燃油轉注活動的行動，共檢獲約5 565公升燃油，並截獲兩名男子。該兩名男子因違反《消防條例》和《危險品條例》被檢控，分別面對兩項及三項控罪，並在西九龍裁判法院被定罪，就每項控罪各被判監禁14日，所有刑期同期執行。

Two men jailed for conducting illicit fuelling activities,2025-10-31 18:58,2025-10-31 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100681.htm,"  Two men were convicted and each sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts yesterday (October 30) for conducting illicit fuelling activities, in contravention of the Fire Services Ordinance and the Dangerous Goods Ordinance.

  The Fire Services Department (FSD) mounted operations against illicit fuelling activities in Kwai Tsing District on April 17 and 30, seizing a total of 5 565 litres of fuel and stopping two men. The men were prosecuted for breaching the Fire Services Ordinance and the Dangerous Goods Ordinance, with two and three charges laid against them respectively. They were convicted at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts and sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment for each charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.

  Under the Fire Services (Fire Hazard Abatement) Regulation, it is an offence to possess or control any controlled substance for the business purpose of transferring it into vehicle fuel tanks. The Dangerous Goods Ordinance also provides that no person shall manufacture, store, convey or use any dangerous goods unless they possess a licence or exemption granted. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty for each offence is a fine of $200,000 and imprisonment for one year.

  In addition, according to the Dangerous Goods (Control) Regulation, it is an offence for any person to store or convey, or cause or permit to be stored or conveyed dangerous goods specified in the regulations, unless the requirements of the relevant dangerous goods' packaging, marking and labelling are complied with. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for six months.

  The FSD is committed to combating illicit fuelling activities through a multipronged strategy to ensure the safety of the community. Members of the public are reminded to refrain from participating in such activities and patronising illegal fuelling stations. Should any suspected illicit fuelling activities be observed, please report them through the Illicit Fuelling Activities on the Fire Hazard Electronic Complaint Portal of the FSD (fhcp.hkfsd.gov.hk) or by calling the 24-hour reporting hotline at 5577 9666."

Green Silk Road International Training Program promotes green development co-operation among Belt and Road countries (with photos),2025-10-31 18:53,2025-10-31 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100503.htm,"âThe Environmental Protection Department (EPD) and the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) jointly organised the first Green Silk Road International Training Program on Environmental Technologies and Sustainable Development (International Training Program), inviting senior environmental officials from Belt and Road (B&R) countries to participate, with an aim to promote exchanges and collaboration on sustainable green development.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of Eco Expo Asia, with the International Training Program featured as one of the key events. The program aims to to enhance environmental technology capacities in B&R countries and foster international environmental exchanges and co-operation under the B&R Initiative. Senior environmental officials from six B&R countries (namely the United Arab Emirates, Laos, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan and Sri Lanka) who attended Eco Expo Asia in Hong Kong have been invited to participate in a training held in Changsha, Hunan Province, from October 29 to November 1.

The Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, today (October 31) attended the training events in Changsha and delivered a speech at the technical seminar of the CAS Centre of Excellence for Water and Environment held in the morning.

  ""Leveraging the Chinese Academy of Sciences' strength of scientific research and combining Hong Kong's unique advantages and extensive experience in environmental protection, the mutual co-operation can generate powerful synergistic effects and further advance international green co-operation under the B&R Initiative. This training program is highly significant, marking the first joint technical seminar and field visit organised by the EPD and the CAS on the Mainland for senior officials from B&R countries. It represents a new level of co-operation between both parties and provides a foundation for the B&R sustainable green development training centre to be set up next year,"" Dr Chui said.

The International Training Program yesterday (October 30) arranged visits to several leading green companies and facilities in Hunan, providing the delegation with insights into the latest technologies and achievements in the environmental protection sector of the Mainland. They also visited the Smart Water Quality Monitoring Station at the Changsha Monkey Stone Water Treatment Plant and an integrated rural sewage treatment facility in Changsha.

In addition to the training program in Changsha, the EPD held a three-day Technical Training Experience Program in Hong Kong during Eco Expo Asia. Through a series of seminars, meetings and site visits, the program shared Hong Kong's experiences in environmental protection and climate change adaptation with representatives from B&R countries.

On the second day (October 29), delegates took a ride on the electric ferry ""Hong Kong Water Taxi 28"" for a tour of Victoria Harbour. While enjoying the cityscape, they learned about Hong Kong's latest developments in green transportation and air quality management. On the third day (October 30), they paid a visit to the Tai Po Kau Tide Gauge Station to learn about Hong Kong's infrastructure for addressing climate change and extreme weather. Moreover, they visited the EcoPark in Tuen Mun to learn about the circular economy, waste recycling, and reuse technologies, and toured the EPD's waste-to-energy facility T·PARK.

In addition, on the second day of Eco Expo Asia (October 29), the EPD jointly organised the Experience Sharing Forum on Promoting Environmental Business in Oversees Market with the RCEES of the CAS. Representatives from the United Arab Emirates, Cambodia, and Kazakhstan introduced policies, regulations, and preferential measures to attract foreign environmental companies' investment. Several Mainland companies also shared their successful experiences in going global. The exchange provided useful information for Hong Kong's environmental industry to expand to overseas markets and encouraged the Mainland enterprises to leverage Hong Kong's business advantages to seek international development opportunities for ""go global"" strategies.

Dr Chui concluded that the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will continue to fully utilise Hong Kong's experience and advantages in environmental protection and infrastructure to assist B&R countries in achieving high-quality and sustainable green development. The EPD will co-ordinate with the RCEES of the CAS's expertise in green technology development and industry connections on the Mainland to actively organise the Green Silk Road International Training Programs in order to promote international exchanges and co-operation on green B&R initiatives and assist high-quality Mainland green enterprises to expand to overseas markets."
"Another new drug approved under ""1+"" mechanism",2025-10-31 18:35,2025-10-31 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100638.htm,"A Government spokesman announced today (October 31) that one more new drug submitted for registration under the new drug approval mechanism (""1+"" mechanism) has been approved for registration in Hong Kong. This new drug is used to reduce proteinuria in patients with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy, bringing more treatment options for patients. The Government continues to strive to accelerate the introduction of innovative drugs and medical devices so that patients can gain early access to advanced diagnoses and treatments, while developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub.

New drug approved
----------------------

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented the ""1+"" mechanism since November 1, 2023, to facilitate the registration of new drugs used for the treatment of life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases in Hong Kong. With effect from November 1 last year, the ""1+"" mechanism has been extended to all new drugs, including all new chemical or biological entities and new indications, and vaccines and advanced therapy products. New drugs that are supported by local clinical data and recognised by local experts can be applied for registration in Hong Kong by submitting approval from one reference drug regulatory authority (instead of two in the past).

The above product has been approved by the drug regulatory authority in the United States and submitted for registration applications under the ""1+"" mechanism. Having evaluated the clinical data and relevant information submitted by the applicant and advice given by local expert, the Registration Committee under the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong considered that the new drug satisfied the criteria of safety, efficacy and quality, and approved the registration of the new drug. The Department of Health (DH) has already notified the applicant of the result of the application. The HKSAR Government will also complete the relevant registration processes in accordance with established procedures.

Paving the way towards primary evaluation
-------------------------------------------------

Since the implementation of the ""1+"" mechanism, a total of 15 new drugs, including the above drug, have been approved under this mechanism. Seven of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. The DH has been promoting the ""1+"" mechanism through different channels and so far has received more than 630 enquiries from over 160 pharmaceutical companies, including those from overseas and the Mainland. Many companies have expressed interest in submitting applications for registration of their products, including advanced therapy products, under the extended ""1+"" mechanism. Since the launch of the pre-new drug application consultation service in March this year, the DH has already held a number of briefing seminars and workshops. The DH will also have pre-new drug application meetings to be rolled out in the fourth quarter of this year, to enhance the efficiency in processing relevant applications.

  ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that the Government will accelerate the reform of the regulatory system of drugs and medical devices, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub. The DH will expedite the ""1+"" mechanism for new drugs, piloting priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs as recommended by the Hospital Authority for treatment of severe or rare diseases and to accelerate patients' use of the advanced treatments. The DH will establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of next year, and implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases beginning next year. The DH will continue to proactively advance preparatory work for ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration and progressively establish a robust approval system, providing strong momentum for the development and market expansion of the healthcare industry in the HKSAR, the Mainland, and beyond, thereby transforming Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub."
HA announces application arrangements under enhanced medical fee waiving mechanism,2025-10-31 18:30,2025-10-31 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100494.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (October 31) the application arrangements under the enhanced medical fee waiving mechanism. Patients with appointments at public hospitals next year can submit advance applications for medical fee waivers in phases starting from November 2025. Additionally, the HA will implement special transitional arrangements from January to March next year to facilitate applications from persons in need. The HA has established dedicated teams to assist patients with fee waiver applications.

  AnHA spokesperson said, ""As the public healthcare fees and charges reform takes effect on January 1 next year, the HA will simultaneously introduce a series of strengthened protection measures, including enhancing the current medical fee waiver mechanism, which will increase the number of eligible beneficiaries from 300 000 to 1.4 million.""

  To handle the additional fee waiver applications, the HA will implement special transitional arrangements during the transition period from January to March next year to ensure timely processing of applications:


Patients with appointments at public hospitals in January or February next year can submit required documentation two months in advance (i.e.in November or December 2025). Applications will be pre-assessed, and eligible patients will receive medical fee waiver certificates before their follow-up appointments after the Reform takes effect on January 1; and
Patients requiring immediate or urgent treatment, who cannot afford medical expenses at the public sector but cannot provide complete documentation for financial assessment, will be granted ""conditional waivers""for full or partial medical fees. Eligible patients need only submit relevant documents within three months to receive official medical fee waiver certificates upon passing the assessment.


  Meanwhile, patients currently holding medical fee waiver certificates (full or partial) can continue using them until expiry without reapplication. Patients with partial fee waiver certificates who qualify for full waivers under the enhanced mechanism can obtain full waivers by declaring no significant change in financial status at Medical Social Services Units (MSSU) three months before appointments or within three months after hospitalisation, without requiring reassessment. The validity will be the same as the original certificate's expiry date.

  As an important part of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the medical fee waiver thresholds will be relaxed from January 1 next year. The income limit will be raised to 100 per cent of the median monthly household income (MMDHI) (for households with two or more persons) or 150 per cent of MMDHI (for single-person households), while the asset limit will be relaxed to that of the public rental housing application. Furthermore, the application procedures and coverage will be enhanced to facilitate public access, including relaxing the definition of ""household"" so that family members without close financial ties to the applicant may be excluded from means testing; expanding the coverage of periodic medical fee waivers to include episodic Family Medicine Out-patient Services; extending the maximum waiver validity period from 12 months to 18 months; and allowing patients to simply sign a declaration confirming unchanged financial status for reapplication within 18 months without resubmitting financial documents.

  Patients can apply for medical fee waivers at MSSU in public hospitals or clinics, as well as the Social Welfare Department's Integrated Family Service Centres, Family and Child Protective Services Units, or other designated service units. Members of the public can also learn about application procedures through the HA's mobile application ""HA Go"" by accessing the ""Medical Fee Assistance Domain"" and preliminarily assess their eligibility through the Means Test Calculator (applicable for applications from January 1, 2026) via ""HA Go"" or the HA website(ewsecal.ha.org.hk/calculator/index.html?lang=en).

  The HA will utilise confirmed means test eligibility under social welfare and other government-subsidised schemes as a reference for processing fee waiver applications, aiming to make arrangements and procedures as clear and simple as possible for the public. The HA will also gradually digitalise the assessment process, allowing applicants to check application status and upload documents through the HA Go mobile application by the end of this year, with the goal of enabling online applications by the third quarter of next year.

  The spokesperson added, ""The HA has established dedicated teams starting from November to ensure timely processing of medical fee waiver applications received by all public hospitals.""

  Additionally, after the public healthcare fees and charges reform takes effect in January next year, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals will continue its mission of providing free outpatient services to those in need. Eligible persons seeking outpatient services at Tung Wah Eastern Hospital, Tung Wah Hospital, and Kwong Wah Hospital will continue to be exempted from the following fees:


Attendance and prescription fees at Family Medicine Clinics (excluding integrated clinics) (applicable to all Eligible Persons)
Attendance fee at Specialist Outpatient Clinics (excluding integrated clinics and allied health clinics) (applicable only to Eligible Persons aged 75 or above, or aged 12 or below)


  Furthermore, the HA has gazetted today the fee revisions for Non-eligible Persons, non-subsidised services at public hospitals, and remaining items of public healthcare services, which will take effect from January 1, 2026. Charges for Non-eligible Persons will be adjusted based on the 2023-24 service cost levels, while fees for non-subsidised services will be adjusted based on cost recovery principles, with reference to market rates. These services will not be subsidised by public funding. The HA will also adjust certain hospital administrative fees (such as certificates and medical reports, photocopying charges, and mortuary). The HA's new fee arrangements are listed in the Annex."
