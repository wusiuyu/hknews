​政務司司長出席二○二五年「青年節@HK」啟動禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-07-29 15:35,2025-07-29 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/29/P2025072900648.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（七月二十九日）出席二○二五年「青年節@HK」啟動禮的致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位青年朋友：

大家好！很開心今日來到青年廣場，與大家共聚一堂，出席二○二五年「青年節@HK」啟動禮。

特區政府非常重視青年發展，透過舉辦及資助不同類型活動，鼓勵青年擴闊眼界，認識和把握多元發展的機遇。

我們於二○二二年推出《青年發展藍圖》，為青年健康成長和多元發展設定政策目標，並按社會和青年的需要不斷推出新措施。《藍圖》推出至今已制訂約250項具體行動和措施，致力培育青年成為愛國愛港、具備世界視野、有抱負和正向思維的新一代。

「青年節@HK」是《藍圖》的重點項目之一。由我擔任主席的青年發展委員會，轄下的「青年節行動小組」，匯聚社會各界的力量，同心協力籌辦「青年節」活動，凝聚廣大青年，讓他們發展潛能、增進知識、以及交流經驗。過去兩屆「青年節」，我們舉辦了超過400項活動，吸引超過40萬人次參與。

今年「青年節」主題是「正向思維」、「推動創新」及「啟發創意」，活動涵蓋多個亮點項目，包括藝術文化、知識交流、生涯規劃、創新創業和運動相關等多個範疇，項目多元豐富，動靜兼備，切合不同青年的學習需要和興趣嗜好，全方位促進青年的個人發展。

今年是中國人民抗日戰爭勝利80周年，我鼓勵各個青年團體及非政府機構，積極舉辦以抗戰勝利80周年為主題的「青年節」伙伴活動，加深青年對國家與香港歷史的認識，培養對民族的歸屬感與自豪感，傳承愛國精神。

今日活動在青年廣場舉行，亦別具意義。去年的《施政報告》提出，將改造青年廣場部分地方成為全新互動空間，讓青年人匯聚交流、發展個人潛能；部分空間還會設立視頻工作室，供青年製作視頻，宣揚「香港青年好故事」，並提供與製作和拍攝視頻相關的培訓。在這裏，我要特別感謝香港賽馬會慈善信託基金，除每年出資支持「青年節」活動，亦撥捐一億五千萬元，支持青年廣場改造計劃。

在座各位都是特區政府的重要夥伴，為青年鋪路搭橋，提供更大發展空間，創造更多機會。我代表特區政府對你們的付出和支持，致以衷心的感謝！

我期待社會各界繼續與特區政府並肩同行，全力落實《青年發展藍圖》，讓青年人發揮所長，為國家、香港和自己打造更寬廣的舞台。

今年「青年節」的口號是「正向新世代．未來更 『青』彩」。我鼓勵青年朋友，踴躍參加「青年節」各項活動，一起燃點青年人的力量，共同創造更精彩的未來。多謝大家！"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 28 to noon today (July 29), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 153 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 154 311 samples of food imported from Japan (including 101 183 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 35 046 samples of local catch respectively.

Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-07-29 11:40,2025-07-29 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/29/P2025072900411.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (July 29) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-07-29 08:44,2025-07-29 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/29/P2025072900226.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (July 29) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-07-29 08:09,2025-07-29 08:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/29/P2025072900191.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (July 29) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

DH gears up for emergency preparedness in response to risk of Chikungunya fever imported cases,2025-07-28 23:21,2025-07-28 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800887.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (July 28) that it has been gearing up for emergency preparedness in response to the possible imported cases of Chikungunya fever (CF). The recent spike in CF cases in multiple regions worldwide (including neighbouring areas), and more frequently travelling among members of the public during summer holidays, pose a significant risk of imported cases in Hong Kong. The Government has implemented various emergency preparedness measures to prevent the spread of CF in Hong Kong and safeguard public health.

""CF is not transmitted from person to person, and is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of female Aedes mosquitoes carrying the CF virus. Aedes albopictus, which is ubiquitous in Hong Kong, can transmit CF. During the early stage after the onset of symptoms (especially when a fever is present), the blood of patients of CF and Dengue Fever (DF) contains a large amount of virus, which is infectious to mosquitoes. If they are bitten by mosquitoes during the communicable period, further local transmission via mosquitoes is possible. If mosquito infestation is serious, it may even lead to large-scale of local outbreaks. Therefore, early identification of infected persons and preventing them from mosquito bites during communicable period is vital in prevention of local transmission,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Emergency preparedness

Despite severe or fatal cases caused by CF is rare and the symptoms are milder than that of DF, and most patients recover on their own, as local mosquitoes have not carried the CF virus, we must strive to prevent CF from becoming endemic in Hong Kong. The Government has adopted multi-pronged emergency preparedness, including:


Control measures at boundary control points (BCPs): the CHP's Port Health Division has been in close contact with Shenzhen Customs to ensure prevention and control measures at BCPs in Shenzhen and Hong Kong are properly put in place. Personnels from Shenzhen and Hong Kong also conducted frontline working meeting today to reinforce the mutual understanding of the disease prevention measures at BCPs.
Enhancing local testing capabilities: the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP is equipped with sufficient testing capabilities. The CHP conducts tests on suspected CF cases for public and private hospitals and no positive cases have been detected so far this year. The CHP has, in collaboration with the Hospital Authority, further enhanced the local testing capabilities to ensure that in the event of an outbreak, suspected cases could be tested as soon as possible with an aim of early detection and diagnosis.
Arranging mosquito-free environment for treatment: avoiding mosquito bites of the patient is an important measure to prevent local transmission. There may be further transmission in the community if local mosquitoes are infected by the CF virus. When there is a confirmed CF case in Hong Kong, the patient will be admitted to a hospital to receive treatment in a mosquito-free environment as a prudent measure.
Epidemiological investigations and risk assessment: the CHP will implement prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessments, which includes providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. The CHP will arrange for laboratory testingif they presented with relevant symptoms.
Vector investigation and mosquito control: the CHP will work closely with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) to conduct on-site inspections, vector investigations and mosquito control, to lower the risk of local transmission.
Supply of medicines: the Government is monitoring the local supply of medicines with antipyretics (e.g. paracetamol), and is maintaining close communication with the suppliers, local manufacturers and community pharmacy associations. The supply of relevant medicines in Hong Kong remains stable. The public need not stockpile the relevant medicines.


Collaboration on disease prevention and control

Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been working closely in communicable disease prevention and control and emergency response according to the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration. Owing to the communicable disease notification mechanism established by the three places, the CHP has kept abreast of the latest situation of CF in Guangdong Province.

The CHP's Port Health Division steps up publicity and education efforts regarding CF at the BCPs, conducts more frequent inspections to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, conducts temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fevers or related symptoms will be assessed on health conditions and referred to hospitals for follow up when necessary. The CHP also maintains close liaison with relevant stakeholders such as airlines and the travel industry to provide the latest disease information and health advice in a timely manner.

Public education and publicity

The CHP will issue letters to all schools and institutions (including residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities) in Hong Kong to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and remind operators to adopt preventive measures to avoid mosquito bites. The CHP and the FEHD will continue to provide advice on anti-mosquito measure to institutions.

The CHP will also hold online seminars this week to raise public awareness of CF and address related inquiries from the public. Details will be announced later on the CHP's social media accounts, and the public is welcome to watch. The CHP has also set up mobile promotional booths at multiple locations across Hong Kong (including public markets, community health centres, and shopping malls) to educate the public on how to prevent mosquito-borne diseases. Details can be viewed atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html.

Measures the public should continue to take

The CHP recommends that the public properly use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients to effectively prevent mosquito bites. The following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


Members of the public returning from areas affected by CF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor.

Latest situation regarding CF

According to the information from the Foshan health authority, as of July 26, there were over 4 700 cases in Foshan city. The majority of cases (4 210 cases) were in Shunde District. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases so far. Moreover, confirmed cases were also recorded in other cities in Guangdong Province recently. Regarding Macao, as of July 25, there were four imported cases of CF, three of them travelled toFoshan city during the incubation period.

There have been no CF cases in Hong Kong since 2020.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the dengue fever page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service,the Chikungunya fever page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."
衞生署做好應急準備　應對基孔肯雅熱輸入風險,2025-07-28 22:35,2025-07-28 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800860.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十八日）表示，一直為可能出現基孔肯雅熱輸入個案做好應急準備。基孔肯雅熱近期在全球多個地區（包括鄰近地區）錄得案例急升，加上市民在暑假期間會較頻繁外遊，香港出現輸入個案的風險相當高。政府已採取多項應急準備，預防基孔肯雅熱在本港傳播，保障市民健康。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「基孔肯雅熱並不會人傳人，主要透過帶有基孔肯雅熱病毒的雌性伊蚊叮咬而傳染給人類。在香港普遍存在的白紋伊蚊可以傳播基孔肯雅熱。基孔肯雅熱及登革熱病人在發病後初期（尤其是在發燒期間），血液會帶有大量病毒，對蚊子具傳染性。如在傳染期被蚊子叮咬，有機會透過蚊子在本地進一步傳播。假如蚊患情況嚴重，甚至有機會導致大規模爆發。因此，及早識別受感染人士及防止他們在傳染期受蚊子叮咬，對預防本地傳播非常關鍵。」

應急準備

雖然基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，而病徵亦與較登革熱輕微，大部分病人可以自行痊癒，但由於本地蚊媒未帶有基孔肯亞熱病毒，我們必須全力預防基孔肯亞熱在本地扎根。政府已積極採取多項應急準備，包括：


口岸防控：中心港口衞生科一直與深圳海關保持緊密聯繫，確保兩地的口岸防控措施到位，兩地人員今日亦舉行前線工作會議，以加強了解雙方在口岸的防控工作。
提升本地檢測能力：中心的公共衞生化驗服務處具備充足的檢測能力。中心會為公立及私家醫院的基孔肯雅熱懷疑病例進行檢測，今年暫時未檢測到陽性個案。中心已聯同醫院管理局進一步提升本地檢測能力，確保本港一旦出現爆發，懷疑個案可盡快進行化驗，以達致早發現、早診斷。
安排無蚊環境接受治療：預防病人受到蚊子叮咬是防止出現本地傳播的重要措施。假如本地蚊子受到基孔肯亞熱病毒感染，便有機會在社區進一步擴散。當本港出現確診基孔肯雅熱個案，為審慎起見，病人會被安排到醫院，以在無蚊環境下接受治療。
流行病學調查及風險評估：中心會按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為個案的家居接觸者或共同暴露於感染源頭的人士提供醫學監察及健康建議，如他們出現相關病徵，中心會安排化驗檢測。
病媒調查及滅蚊：中心會與食物環境衞生署（食環署）緊密合作，實地視察有關地點並進行病媒調查及滅蚊，減低本地傳播的風險。
藥物供應：政府正監察含退熱成分的藥物（例如: 撲熱息痛）在香港的供應情況，並與供應商、本地製藥業及社區藥房組織保持緊密溝通聯繫。有關藥物在本港整體供應維持穩定，市民不需要囤積有關藥物。


聯防聯控

粵港澳三地根據《粵港澳突發公共衞生事件應急合作協議》之框架指導，在傳染病聯防聯控及緊急應變等方面持續深化合作。中心根據三地建立的傳染病通報機制，充分掌握廣東省近日基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。

港口衞生科已在各個口岸加強有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作；加強巡查四周確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施；為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。中心亦會與航空公司和旅遊業界等持份者保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議。

公眾教育和宣傳

中心會就基孔肯雅熱去信全港學校及院舍（包括安老院舍及殘疾人士院舍），以提供最新流行病學資訊，並提醒負責人採取預防措施以防止蚊子叮咬。中心並會繼續聯同食環署為各機構提供預防蚊患的建議。

中心亦會於本周舉行網上講座，喚起公眾對基孔肯雅熱的關注和回應市民的相關查詢，詳情稍後會於中心的社交媒體帳號公布，歡迎市民收看。中心亦已在全港多個不同地點（包括公共街市、地區康健中心及商場）設置流動宣傳攤位，教育公眾如何預防蚊子傳播的疾病，詳情可瀏覽www.chp.gov.hk/tc/other/events/476.html。

市民應繼續採取的措施

中心建議市民使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；以及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。

基孔肯雅熱的最新情況

根據佛山衞生當局資訊，截至七月二十六日佛山市已錄得超過4 700宗個案，絕大部分個案在順德區錄得（4 210宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。此外，廣東省其他城市近日亦出現確診個案。澳門方面，截至七月二十五日，錄得四宗基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，其中三名患者於潛伏期內曾到佛山市。

本港由二○二○年至今，沒有錄得確診基孔肯雅熱的個案。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務登革熱專頁、衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁及YouTube頻道。"

根據《冰凍甜點規例》（第132AC章），任何供出售的冰凍甜點，每克不可含有多於一百個大腸菌群。違法者一經定罪，最高可處罰款一萬元及監禁三個月。大腸菌群含量超出法例標準，顯示產品的衞生情況欠理想，並不表示會引起食物中毒。

發言人說：「中心已知會涉事進口商上述違規事項。有關進口商已按中心指示將受影響產品停售和下架，並展開回收工作。市民可於辦公時間致電其熱線2647 1138，查詢有關產品的回收事宜。中心會暫時撤銷較早前簽發予有關進口商銷售該款產品的批准。」

中心會就事件通知日本有關當局，並會繼續跟進事件及採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"
Imported prepackaged frozen confection sample detected with coliform bacteria counts exceeding legal limits,2025-07-28 19:52,2025-07-28 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800731.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (July 28) that a sample of prepackaged frozen confection imported from Japan was detected with coliform bacteria count exceeding the legal limit. Some of the product concerned have entered the market. The importer concerned has stopped sale and removed from shelves the affected product, and has initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. The CFS is following up on the incident.

Product details:

Product name: Black Tea Ice Cream
Brand: Kochi Ice
Place of origin: Japan
Net volume: 115ml
Best-before date: April 18, 2027
Importer: Shin Tai Ho (Hong Kong) Company Limited

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample at the import level for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained 140 coliform bacteria per gram, exceeding the legal limit.""

Under the Frozen Confections Regulation (Cap. 132 AC), frozen confection for sale should not contain more than 100 coliform bacteria per gram. The maximum penalty for offenders is a fine of $10,000 and three months' imprisonment upon conviction. The fact that the coliform count exceeded the legal limit indicated that the hygienic conditions were unsatisfactory, but did not mean that consumption would lead to food poisoning.

""The CFS has informed the importer concerned of the irregularities. The importer concerned has stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected product, and has initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2647 1138 during office hours for enquiries about the recall of the product concerned. The CFS will temporarily suspend the permission to import for sale of the product concerned granted earlier to the importer,"" the spokesman said.

The CFS will inform the Japanese authority of the incident, and will continue to follow up on the case and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."

​運輸及物流局局長出席香港金融管理局數據峰會2025致辭（只有中文）,2025-07-28 19:08,2025-07-28 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800664.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（七月二十八日）出席香港金融管理局數據峰會2025的致辭全文：

Eddie（香港金融管理局總裁余偉文）、Fred（香港機場管理局主席林天福）、Mary（香港銀行公會主席禤惠儀）、Howard（香港金融管理局副總裁李達志）、各位金融界和銀行界的朋友：

多謝Eddie的邀請，很榮幸出席今日二○二五年數據峰會，亦是運輸及物流局首次參加這個峰會，別具意義。

剛才參觀展覽攤位時，銀行界、金融界和物流界提出了很多共通點，Eddie的開幕致辭證明了這點，給予我們很多正面的能量。運輸及物流局負責推動香港對內和對外的交通和運輸物流的工作，而推動社會的發展「power」很重要。說到「power」，我們局方最近常說綠色能源。我今日不跟大家談能源，而是談數據。正如Eddie所說，誰主宰數據、掌握數據，誰就可以定義未來。數據真是很「powerful」。

國家支持香港作為金融中心、航運中心、物流中心「三個中心」的戰略定位。我們常說這「三個中心」都非常重要，亦是我們的傳統優勢。其實三者之間息息相關、環環相扣，而數據可以作為三者的連繫。我們現時面對關稅戰、全球貿易和供應鏈都受不明朗因素影響、全球經濟格局都在逐漸重塑中。我們經常跟航空、物流、航運界別的業界說要團結一致，亦要有破局精神，要在現時很大的挑戰之中尋求突破。金融中心支撐物流和貨運方面的發展，而貿易中心亦靠機場或貨櫃碼頭的運作承載貨物，所以三者的確是缺一不可。

今日很開心看到香港金融管理局推動數據升級轉型，亦邀請了運輸及物流局和我們的業界參與你們的Project CargoX。剛才參觀攤位，我感受到有很多業界都在推動這方面的發展。Project CargoX正正是透過數據進行跨界協作，藉着數據協助例如中小企突破以往貿易和物流融資時的痛點。

我們經常說需要打通數據和貨物流通，航空方面，我知道Fred稍後和大家分享在航空方面如何做到關於數字和數據的平台，他們在這方面一直領先。我經常向Fred表示我很羨慕，為何在港口和航運物流不可以做類似的東西？究竟是甚麼令我們裹足不前？我們的業界一直很希望可以做到這一方面，今年我們做到了。我們成功在立法會取得撥款，由政府注資、政府牽頭、政府帶領，作為擔當衝破這一步。我們成功取得撥款後，在今年下半年會積極構建整個系統，但過去一兩年我們已就所有基建和系統的連接進行試驗及試點，所以在某些物流供應鏈上，我們已和業界有實戰經驗。二○二六年即明年的一月，我們就會構建好系統供業界使用。剛才大家如果有機會經過我們的攤位，可以了解到我們不會等構建完畢才讓業界使用。事實上，透過這個系統，我們的數據會有三個特點：第一，整個貨物追蹤會透明化；第二，因為系統是政府構建及營運，業界可以不用擔心數據外洩、又或擔心競爭者的情況，政府會主持公道，Let's do it；第三，透過數據在平台進行連接，我們希望做到貨物追蹤，從而助力貿易融資，利用區塊鏈技術，可以在平台上追蹤例如冷鏈貨物由出發點至目的地期間的實際的位置、以至溫度管控的資訊。

剛才很多銀行界朋友在展覽攤位向我們提及可以協助中小企貿易及融資，我在這方面不一一重覆，但在物流和航運界別而言，我們的確要關顧中小企。中小企很多時候要是處理一票貨的流轉，但融資時現時大都是用紙本證明，這不單令成本增加，審批時間亦長，以後資訊和數據便可取代紙本驗證。我們抓緊時間，負責營運這個系統的代辦LSCM（物流及供應鏈多元技術研發中心）已和業界有更進一步的試驗計劃和應用場景，亦有業界已經加入推動和試驗增值功能，包括貨流驗證和融資，進一步減省信貸成本和縮短審批程序。

另外值得一提的是，剛才展覽攤位提到跨境物流。我們在取得PCS（港口社區系統）的撥款後，已經第一時間進一步加深跨境或者區域協作。我們很希望能連通世界，所以已率先在五月和廣東省電子口岸管理有限公司簽訂合作備忘錄，將港口社區系統與廣東的電子口岸辦公室對接，方便日後業界「一單兩報」。在航運來說，他們可以預先填報、預先報關，整個流程就可以更快。

大家不得不知，雖然我們說港口吞吐量面對不少挑戰，但在國際航運綜合實力來說，香港位居第四，這不只包含吞吐量，更是質素和效率，及高端海運服務。我想藉今日的機會做兩個宣傳：第一，我們接下來在航空和航運方面會有「鐵海陸江」的概念，將距離香港非常遠的貨物透過香港與世界接軌。我們可以透過鐵路接通海運或陸運，現時不少內陸城市例如成都、重慶以至廣西已加強跨境電商甚至快檢，通過高鐵連接駁船來港。內地現時亦積極建構運河，將貨物運到樞紐機場和港口，所以透過今日所說的數據平台，特別是PCS，將可以促進多式聯運。

第二，在航運或航空方面，我們會邁向低碳和零碳。我們會建立平台，將內地新能源供應商和香港的船務運作或融資匯聚起來。最近，我們和國家商務部已經建構了平台，將不同持份者或企業連在一起。我很希望Project CargoX或「商業數據通」的概念可以放在綠色金融，不單金融產品可以更豐富和多元化，在航空和航運方面都可以助力我們作為國際航空樞紐和國際航運中心的發展。

我希望大家稍後有時間的話可以參觀LSCM的攤位，我亦希望多謝今日在座的物流業界朋友，沒有他們的支持，我們不可以這麼快取得撥款及建構這個系統。多謝大家。"
SED expresses deep sorrow over passing of Dr Hu Hung-lick,2025-07-28 18:55,2025-07-28 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800649.htm,"The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, today (July 28) expressed deep sorrow over the passing of the President of Hong Kong Shue Yan University, Dr Hu Hung-lick, and extended her heartfelt condolences to his family.

Dr Choi said, ""Dr Hu dedicated himself to education. Together with the late Dr Chung Chi-yung, they established Shue Yan College in 1971, striving to promote the popularisation of higher education and nurturing numerous young talent for society over the past half century. In 2006, Shue Yan College was officially renamed as Hong Kong Shue Yan University and became the first private university in Hong Kong, which was an important milestone in the local higher education. Guided by the motto of 'cultivating virtues of benevolence; broadening horizons and knowledge', Dr Hu cultivated students with both moral integrity and benevolence. His educational philosophy and enthusiasm have benefited generations of students, making him a true role model for the education sector.""

Dr Choi firmly believes that the selfless contributions and noble spirit of this educational pioneer will be remembered fondly by all."

是次演習有超過100名海關、入境事務處及消防處人員參與。演習模擬海關人員根據情報，在青衣海關驗貨場對一個可疑貨櫃進行查驗時，發現一名懷疑與恐怖組織有關的非法入境者匿藏其中。當海關人員進一步檢查櫃內貨物時，發現當中所載的危害物質出現洩漏。海關人員隨即啓動部門緊急應變計劃，並即時通報跨部門反恐專責組及相關部門。入境事務處接獲通知後，迅速出動流動鑑證戰術車到場，鑑證該懷疑非法入境者所持的旅行證件。消防處人員接報後亦迅速到場，調派危害物質專隊處理有關危害物質及進行洗消程序。

是次演習不單提升前線人員的反恐意識和處理反恐情報的能力，更加強了各部門在應對涉及恐怖活動緊急事件時的協作與溝通，切實保障市民生命財產及維護國家安全。"
Inter-departmental counter-terrorism intelligence handling and hazardous material incident exercise conducted (with photos),2025-07-28 18:45,2025-07-28 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800637.htm,"Hong Kong Customs, in collaboration with the Immigration Department (ImmD) and the Fire Services Department (FSD), conducted a joint counter-terrorism intelligence handling and hazardous material incident exercise codenamed ""TREADING SEA"" this afternoon (July 28) at the Tsing Yi Customs Cargo Examination Compound.

Over 100 officers from Hong Kong Customs, the ImmD and the FSD participated in the exercise. The exercise simulated a situation where Customs officers, acting on intelligence, inspected a suspicious container at the Tsing Yi Cargo Examination Compound and discovered an illegal immigrant suspected of being connected to a terrorist organisation hiding inside the container. During further inspection of goods inside the container, a leakage of hazardous material was found. Customs officers swiftly activated the departmental contingency response plan and notified the Inter-departmental Counter Terrorism Unit and relevant government departments. The ImmD promptly deployed their Mobile Identification Tactical Unit to the scene to verify the authenticity of the travel documents held by the illegal immigrant. FSD officers also attended the scene shortly upon being summoned, and the Hazardous Materials Team was deployed to carry out decontamination procedures and handle the hazardous material.

This exercise not only enhanced frontline officers' counter-terrorism awareness and their capabilities to handle counter-terrorism intelligence, but also strengthened inter-departmental coordination and communication in responding to terrorism-related emergencies, thereby protecting the lives and property of citizens as well as safeguarding national security."
Development Bureau imposes regulating action on contractors and subcontractor involved in fatal industrial incident at public works construction site in Southern District on Hong Kong Island,2025-07-28 18:44,2025-07-28 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800609.htm,"   A spokesman for the Development Bureau (DEVB) said today (July 28) that regarding the fatal industrial incident that happened on July 27 at a public works construction site in Southern District on Hong Kong Island, the contractors concerned were on the List of Approved Contractors for Public Works (the List) and the subcontractor concerned was on the List of Approved Suppliers of Materials and Specialist Contractors for Public Works (the Specialist List).

   The DEVB, being the party to procure services for public works, attaches great importance to the site safety performance of all construction sites under the purview of contractors on the List and the Specialist List. The DEVB issued notifications to the contractors and subcontractor concerned today to suspend the contractors and subcontractor from tendering for public works contracts in the buildings category and the lift, escalator and passenger conveyor installation category respectively with immediate effect pursuant to the regulating regime. The contractors and subcontractor concerned have to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system. Taking cognisance of the outcome of the independent safety audit, the contractors and subcontractor are required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures, with a view to demonstrating that they have an effective safety management system before the lifting of the suspension from tendering can be considered. The suspension from tendering is not only confined to future tender exercises, but is also applicable to tender exercises with procedures initiated but not concluded.

   The Labour Department is investigating this industrial incident and will handle it in accordance with the law. Subject to the investigation findings, the DEVB may impose further regulating actions on the contractors and subcontractor concerned later on, including extension of the period of suspension from tendering for public works contracts and even removal from the List and Specialist List."
發展局向港島南區一個政府工務工程建築工地致命工業事故的承建商及分包商作出規管行動,2025-07-28 18:44,2025-07-28 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800605.htm,"發展局發言人今日（七月二十八日）表示，就七月二十七日在港島南區一個政府工務工程建築工地發生的致命工業事故，涉事承建商是發展局認可公共工程承建商名冊內的承建商，而涉事分包商則是認可公共工程物料供應商及專門承造商名冊內的承建商。

局方作為政府工務工程服務採購方，一向十分重視認可名冊內的承建商在其轄下所有建築工地的安全表現。局方今日已按規管機制向涉事承建商及分包商發出通知，分別即時暫停涉事承建商建築類別及涉事分包商升降機、自動梯及乘客輸送帶裝置類別的工務工程投標資格。承建商及分包商須進行獨立安全審核，以檢視其安全管理系統，並按獨立安全審核結果提交改善方案及完成落實改善措施。待局方審視及確信其具備有效安全管理系統，才會考慮恢復其投標資格。有關暫停投標資格的規管行動不單適用於未來的招標，也適用於已經投標但尚未批出的工程合約。

勞工處現正就這宗工業事故進行調查並會依法處理，局方往後會因應調查結果，按需要對涉事承建商及分包商採取進一步規管行動，包括延長暫停投標資格的期限，甚至從認可名冊內除名。"
就「創新及科技基金」資助計劃的精簡及整合措施,2025-07-28 18:00,2025-07-28 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800456.htm,"創新科技署（創科署）今日（七月二十八日）宣布，將精簡並整合「創新及科技基金」（基金）下的資助計劃，以更聚焦地推進新型工業化及支持發展新質生產力。

創科署一直配合社會及經濟發展的步伐，持續優化基金，為本地創科生態的未來發展注入動力。自本屆政府於二○二二年七月上任以來，創科署已在基金下推出「產學研1+計劃」和「新型工業加速計劃」，並成立「香港微電子研發院」。同時，本屆政府亦即將推出「創科產業引導基金」、「前沿科技研究支援計劃」及「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」。

為更有效支援企業把握新型工業化帶來的機遇，透過相關資助計劃實現升級轉型，創科署將整合基金下三項推進新型工業化的資助計劃（即「新型工業化資助計劃」、「新型工業化及科技培訓計劃」，以及於今年內推出的「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」）為「新型工業化支援計劃」。在新計劃下，三項資助計劃的目的及基本運作模式將維持不變。

此外，在檢視基金下各項資助計劃的政策目標及資助對象後，創科署將會精簡並整合以下資助計劃：

（一）整合「投資研發現金回贈計劃」及「創新及科技支援計劃」：兩項資助計劃均旨在資助本地研究及發展（研發）中心、大學及其他指定公營科研機構與公司合作，進行應用研發項目，把研發成果轉移至本地業界，協助行業升級轉型，提升競爭力。鑑於兩項資助計劃的目的與資助對象大致相同，在整合措施實施後，本地公營科研機構可繼續透過「創新及科技支援計劃」與公司合作進行應用研發項目。

（二）「專利申請資助計劃」與現有資助計劃融合：「專利申請資助計劃」旨在資助從未擁有任何專利及從未接受該計劃資助的本地註冊公司和香港永久居民為其發明申請專利。鑑於基金下各項現有研發相關的資助計劃（即「創新及科技支援計劃」、「內地與香港科技合作資助計劃」，以及「企業支援計劃」）已為大學、科研機構及企業的研發項目提供專利註冊費資助，創科署認為「專利申請資助計劃」已達成在香港培育專利發展文化的目標。

上述資助計劃的資源整合、資助上限和比例的調整安排，將於二○二五年八月一日零時零分起生效，有關詳情載於附件。連同創科署先前向立法會工商及創新科技事務委員會報告的精簡措施，基金下的資助計劃數目在整合後將變為10項。

以上資助計劃的詳情載於基金網頁（www.itf.gov.hk）。如有查詢，請聯絡計劃的秘書處（電話：3655 5678；電郵：enquiry@itf.gov.hk）。"

Funding schemes under Innovation and Technology Fund to be streamlined and consolidated,2025-07-28 18:00,2025-07-28 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800457.htm,"âThe Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) announced today (July28) that it would streamline and consolidate funding schemes under the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) with a view to promoting new industrialisation and supporting the development of new quality productive forces in a more focused manner.

  The ITC has been continuously enhancing the ITF to keep pace with social-economic developments and to inject impetus into the future development of the local innovation and technology ecosystem. Since the current-term Government took office in July 2022, the ITC has launched the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme and the New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme under the ITF, as well as established the Hong Kong Microelectronics Research and Development Institute. In addition, the current-term Government will soon launch the Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund, the Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme and the Pilot Manufacturing and Production Line Upgrade Support Scheme (Manufacturing+).

In order to more effectively support enterprises in seizing opportunities brought by new industrialisation to upgrade and transform through relevant funding schemes, the ITC will consolidate three funding schemes under the ITF which promote new industrialisation (namely the New Industrialisation Funding Scheme, the New Industrialisation and Technology Training Programme, and the Manufacturing+ to be launched this year) into the New Industrialisation Support Scheme. Under the new scheme, the objectives and modus operandi of the three schemes will remain unchanged.

Furthermore, after reviewing the policy objectives and beneficiaries of the various funding schemes under the ITF, the ITC will streamline and consolidate the following funding schemes:

(1) Consolidating the Research and Development Cash Rebate Scheme and the Innovation and Technology Support Programme (ITSP): Both funding schemes aim to support local research and development (R&D) centres, universities and other designated local public research institutes to collaborate with enterprises in conducting applied R&D projects with a view to transferring R&D outcomes to local industries, thereby assisting the industry to upgrade and transform, as well as to enhance its competitiveness. Given that the objectives and beneficiaries of the two funding schemes largely overlap, local public research institutes may continue to collaborate with enterprises for applied R&D projects through the ITSP after the consolidation measures take effect.

(2) Integrating the Patent Application Grant (PAG) into existing funding schemes: PAG aims to subsidise locally incorporated companies and Hong Kong permanent residents which/who have neither owned any patent nor received funding from PAG before to apply for patents for their own inventions. Given that existing R&D-related funding schemes under the ITF (namely ITSP, Mainland-Hong Kong Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme and Enterprise Support Scheme) have already been subsidising patent registration fees for R&D projects by universities, research institutions and enterprises, the ITC considers that PAG has achieved its goal of fostering a patent development culture in Hong Kong.

âThe consolidation of resources, adjustments to funding ceilings and ratios for the aforementioned funding schemes will take effect from August 1, 2025, at 0.00am. Relevant details are available in the Annex. Together with the streamlining measures previously reported by the ITC to the Panel on Commerce, Industry, Innovation and Technology of the Legislative Council, the number of funding schemes under ITF will be 10 after the consolidation.

Details of the aforementioned funding schemes are available on the ITF website (www.itf.gov.hk). For enquiries, please contact the secretariats of the schemes (tel: 3655 5678; email: enquiry@itf.gov.hk)."

Customs officers distributed promotional items to residents at the Estate and promoted to them Customs' enforcement actions against illicit cigarettes and the Government's proposal to amend the existing legislation to increase penalties for illicit cigarette-related offences, as well as provided estate security personnel with information on what to do when a suspected illicit cigarette activity is found.

If public rental housing units are found to be involved in illicit cigarette crimes, Customs will notify the HD for follow-up action after the conclusion of court proceedings. Customs reminds members of the public, especially young people, not to buy or sell illicit cigarettes or distribute illicit cigarette leaflets to avoid creating a criminal record that could affect their future.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities. Also, Customs will strengthen publicity and education to remind the public not to take part in unlawful acts related to illicit cigarettes.

Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

The first case involved a 65-year-old male passenger arriving in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found a batch of suspected cannabis buds, weighing about 10kg, concealed inside vacuum-sealed bags in his check-in suitcase.

Data Summit 2025,2025-07-28 16:40,2025-07-28 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800336.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) successfully co-organised the Data Summit 2025 today (July 28). The Summit attracted around 800 senior executives and industry professionals from almost 100 public and private organisations, including government departments, banks, data specialists and partners of Commercial Data Interchange (CDI).

Themed ""Empowering business and trade through advanced data infrastructure"", the Summit explored how data infrastructure can enhance trade finance processes and facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending, thereby fuelling trade and commerce growth. The keynote addresses and panel discussions of the Summit focused on four key areas, including Project CargoX on trade finance, open government data, SME credit insights and cross-boundary data validation. 15 CDI partner institutions also showcased cutting-edge commercial data innovations and use cases through interactive exhibition booths, fostering industry collaboration and experience sharing.

At the Summit, the HKMA presented the latest developments and future roadmap of CDI, with key highlights including:

  1. Project CargoX

The Expert Panel has welcomed new members (see Annex) to further enhance the digital ecosystem for trade finance; and




Six CargoX pilot banks (Note 1), participating in the Transport and Logistics Bureau's new trial phase of the Port Community System, have preliminarily validated the effectiveness of using cargo data to verify trade authenticity. This, in turn, helps streamline trade finance process and strengthen risk management. More innovative use cases are underway.


  2.Open government data

The HKMA, the Government's Digital Policy Office (DPO) and the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) are collaborating closely on the planned connection with the CEDB's Trade Single Window Phase 3, which is targeted for roll-out in phases in 2026, via the linkage between CDI and Consented Data Exchange Gateway. This will enable users to authorise the sharing of their import and export declaration data with participating banks, with a view to expediting loan approvals; and




The DPO's Digital Corporate Identity (CorpID) Platform is set to launch progressively from end-2026. The HKMA will explore and design the application of CorpID for electronic signing in CDI, with the aim of streamlining the corporate authorisation process.


  3.Credit insights

The HKMA is advancing a proof-of-concept (PoC) project on Commercial Credit Reference Agency (CCRA) 2.0, enabling the CCRA operator to build a corporate credit scoring model. Initial findings from the nine pilot banks (Note 2)indicate that the new model can effectively streamline the loan application process and reduce borrowing costs for SMEs.


  4.Cross-boundary data validation

CDI successfully linked with the Shenzhen-Hong Kong cross-boundary data validation platform (the platform) (Note 3)in April this year. Banks have successfully connected to the new arrangement for the purposes of processing personal and corporate loan applications.


  The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,said, ""The HKMA remains dedicated to advancing Hong Kong's data infrastructure in partnership with heavyweight strategic stakeholders in the data ecosystem. By continuously fostering data interconnectivity and unlocking the potential of both traditional and alternative data, we empower financial institutions, data providers and SME traders to benefit from streamlined and efficient processes brought by data sharing. Looking ahead, our next-generation CDI data infrastructure will continue to optimise trade finance processes, spur trade and commerce innovation, as well as support SME growth, ultimately contributing to the development of the real economy.""

  The Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan,said, ""The theme of this year's Data Summit aptly aligns with the country's strategic positioning of Hong Kong to consolidate its role as the three key centres of finance, trade, and shipping, using data as a key connector. The Transport and Logistics Bureau is developing the Port Community System in full steam to connect all stakeholders across the cargo shipment process and integrate sea, land, and air transport data to materialise full transparency of cargo status. We will continue to support the industry in leveraging the system to explore more use cases for financing, further facilitating cargo, trade and capital flows.""

  The Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam,said, ""Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is the world's number one cargo airport, a position we have held 14th times since 2010. To further enhance our competitiveness, we must continue to leverage the power of technology, and digitalisation of the air cargo supply chain is one of the key steps to achieve greater efficiency and enable value-added services. The Airport Authority's HKIA Cargo Data Platform, anchored on advanced technologies such as blockchain and smart contract, provides a trusted, intelligent platform that facilitates secured, seamless and paperless information exchange, efficient cargo process and innovative business solutions. Leveraging our platform's cargo data and in collaboration with the HKMA's CDI, we are able to facilitate SMEs' financing process and enhance credit risk management. We welcome continuous development in this area and anticipate further opportunities for collaboration with the HKMA and other business partners to develop Hong Kong into the region's leading e-commence fulfillment centre.""

  The Chairperson of the HKAB, Ms Mary Huen,said, ""As Hong Kong undergoes economic restructuring, the banking industry is committed to providing SMEs with flexible and convenient financing to support their upgrading and transformation so as to remain competitive. The HKAB encourages its member banks to actively participate in the latest CDI-related initiatives led by the HKMA, including the PoC studies of Project CargoX and CCRA 2.0 as well as cross-boundary data validation pilot. The initiatives will streamline loan approval processes and improve credit risk management by leveraging government and industry data. We look forward to collaborating further with the HKMA and the relevant government departments to enhance the digital ecosystem of trade finance, with the objective of jointly strengthening our support to SMEs and promoting Hong Kong's economic development.""

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that merchandise exports performance remained resilient in June. The value of merchandise exports grew noticeably further by 11.9% over a year earlier. Exports to the Mainland and most other Asian markets continued to expand visibly, while those to the United States and the European Union fell.

  Looking ahead, the sustained steady growth in various Asian economies in particular the Mainland economy, as well as Hong Kong's enhanced economic and trade ties with different markets, should continue to support merchandise trade performance. Nonetheless, the outlook of global trade policy is still uncertain. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and stay vigilant.

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-07-28 16:30,2025-07-28 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800445.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (July 28) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From July 20 to 26, the CHP recorded five community-acquired LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


An 88-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Kwai Tsing District;
A 61-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Sha Tin District;
A 60-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Sha Tin District;
A 68-year-old male patient with good past health living in Kwai Tsing District; and
An 81-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Yau Tsim Mong District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that all five cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of July 26, 90 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.
