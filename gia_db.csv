食環署持續落實規管私人泳池救生員措施,2025-12-22 15:00,2025-12-22 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200227.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（十二月二十二日）表示，為保障泳池使用者的安全，食環署自今年五月起實施一系列加強規管私人泳池救生員的措施，至今運作暢順並達致預期效果。食環署將持續推行該等措施。

截至十一月三十日，食環署今年於不同時段對全港逾1 400個持牌私人泳池進行約11 000次巡查，並透過中國香港拯溺總會核實超過5 000個救生員資格，當中發現一宗懷疑有救生員使用虛假救生員證件的個案。食環署已就事件報警，並就泳池開放期間未有提供足夠合資格救生員向有關泳池持牌人提出檢控。其後，該泳池持牌人因違反《泳池規例》（第132CA章第12條）在裁判法院被判罪名成立，罰款8,000元；而不合資格的救生員亦因欺詐罪及以欺騙手段取得金錢利益罪被警方起訴，在裁判法院被判罪名成立，判處監禁兩個月。此外，食環署亦發現兩宗懷疑未有提供足夠合資格救生員的個案，並已展開調查，如有足夠證據會提出檢控。同期，食環署人員在巡查期間就泳池持牌人違反與救生員有關的牌照條件共發出13個口頭警告，涉及未有在泳池入口展示在場當值的救生員數目及未有妥善填寫或保存救生員每日當值紀錄等。

發言人說：「整體而言，絕大部分泳池均遵守與救生員有關的規定，而食環署的巡查亦能有效找出違規個案。食環署會持續執行各項措施，保障泳池使用者的安全。」

發言人強調，泳池持牌人必須嚴格履行核實救生員資格的責任，確保泳池開放期間有足夠的合資格救生員當值。食環署提醒所有泳池持牌人，切勿聘用不合資格的救生員或容許使用虛假資格的救生員當值，並須嚴格遵守《泳池規例》（第132CA章）及其他牌照條件。如發現違規情況，署方會嚴肅跟進。

食環署自今年五月十九日起實施一系列加強規管私人泳池救生員的措施，包括在不同時段增加巡查頻次、規定持牌人在聘用救生員前須核對其身分證明文件並將其救生章和救生手冊的副本存檔、引入新懲處機制、加強與中國香港拯溺總會及物業管理業監管局合作等。"

FEHD continues to implement regulatory measures for life-saving attendants at private swimming pools,2025-12-22 15:00,2025-12-22 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200229.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (December 22) that, to safeguard swimming pool users, the FEHD has implemented a series of enhancement measures regulating life-saving attendants at private swimming pools from May this year. The FEHD will continue to implement these measures, which have been operating smoothly to date and have achieved the intended results.

As at November 30, the FEHD had conducted approximately 11 000 inspections at various times of the day across over 1 400 licensed private swimming pools in Hong Kong, and had verified over 5 000 lifeguard qualifications through the Hong Kong China Life Saving Society (HKLSS) this year. One case involving suspected use of a fraudulent life-saving attendant certificate was identified. The FEHD reported it to the Police and prosecuted the swimming pool licensee for failing to provide a sufficient number of qualified life-saving attendants during pool opening hours. The licensee concerned was subsequently convicted by the magistrates' court for contravening the Swimming Pools Regulation (Section 12 of Cap. 132CA) and fined $8,000. The unqualified life-saving attendant who used the fraudulent qualification was also prosecuted by the Police and sentenced to two months' imprisonment for the offences of ""fraud"" and ""obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception"". In addition, two other suspected cases of insufficient provision of qualified life-saving attendants were found and the FEHD has initiated investigations. Prosecutions will be instituted should there be sufficient evidence. During the inspections over the same period, FEHD officers issued a total of 13 verbal warnings against licensees for violating the licensing conditions relating to life-saving attendants. These warnings involved failures to display at the pool entrances the number of life-saving attendants on duty and to properly complete or maintain life-saving attendants' daily duty records.

The spokesman said, ""Overall, most of the swimming pools were in compliance with the regulations relating to life-saving attendants, and the FEHD's inspections were effective in identifying suspected violations. The FEHD will continue to execute the measures to ensure the safety of swimming pool users.""

The spokesman stressed that swimming pool licensees are required to strictly fulfill their responsibility of verifying the qualifications of life-saving attendants and ensuring sufficient qualified life-saving attendants are on duty while the pool is open. The FEHD reminded all swimming pool licensees not to employ unqualified life-saving attendants or permit those with fraudulent qualifications to be on duty, and to strictly observe the Swimming Pools Regulation (Cap. 132CA) and other licensing conditions. The FEHD will take stringent follow-up actions against any violation identified.

Since May 19 this year, the FEHD has implemented a series of enhanced measures to strengthen the regulation of lifeguards at private swimming pools. These include stepping up inspection frequency at different times of the day, requiring licensees to verify the identity documents of life-saving attendants before employment and to keep copies of their Pool Lifeguard Awards and personal logbooks on proper record, introducing a new penalty mechanism and strengthening co-operation with HKLSS and the Property Management Services Authority."

Waste statistics for 2024 published,2025-12-22 13:11,2025-12-22 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200312.htm,"The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 22) published the report ""Monitoring of Solid Waste in Hong Kong - Waste Statistics for 2024"". It presents the 2024 statistics on disposal and recovery/recycling of solid waste generated in Hong Kong, including municipal solid waste (MSW) (covering both domestic waste and commercial and industrial waste), overall construction waste and special waste.

The total quantity of MSW disposed of at landfills has dropped for three consecutive years to 3.85 million tonnes in 2024, and the average daily quantity was 10 510 tonnes, representing a decrease of 3.4 per cent comparing with the average of 10 884 tonnes in 2023. Among these, disposal of waste plastics has dropped by 11.1 per cent; disposal of food waste has dropped by 6.0 per cent; disposal of waste glass has decreased by 7.1 per cent. The per capita MSW disposal rate per day was 1.40 kilograms, down from 1.44 kilograms in 2023 by 3.3 per cent. Among the three major categories of MSW in 2024, food waste accounted for 29 per cent, followed by waste paper and waste plastics, accounting for 23 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.

With the implementation of various measures by the Government in promoting food waste recycling and plastic-free culture, including the implementation of the regulation on disposable plastic products in 2024, both the shares of disposal of food waste and waste plastics had decreased compared to 2023. The drop in the disposal amount of waste plastics also reflected the increasing global awareness of being ""plastic-free"" in recent years and the effectiveness of the Government's active promotion of various related measures. Since the Government enhanced the Plastic Shopping Bag Charging Scheme on December 31, 2022, the amount of plastic shopping bags disposed in 2024 has dropped to 56 408 tonnes, down from 63 367 tonnes in 2023 by 11 per cent. Meanwhile, the share of waste paper has increased; this was mainly paper waste other than cardboard, newsprint, office paper or tetrapak that could not be easily recycled.

The overall MSW recovery rate has risen for four consecutive years. The latest figures show that it rose from 33 per cent in 2023 to 34 per cent in 2024 and the increase in the total recovery amount was about 50000 tonnes. The increase was mainly driven by the recycling of food waste (around 26000 tonnes) and ferrous metal recyclables (around 53000 tonnes).

An EPD spokesperson said that in order to achieve the vision of ""Waste Reductionâ§Resources Circulationâ§Zero Landfill"" by 2035, the current term Government is working at full steam to promote the culture of waste reduction and recovery, and to encourage active participation in waste reduction by citizens through the community recycling network GREEN@COMMUNITY and the food waste collection network. The latest statistics show that the current-term Government has successfully reversed the long-term upward trend in waste disposal quantities. The recovery rate showed a continuous upward trend, reflecting the achievements of the Government's persistent effort in promoting waste reduction and recovery.

Regarding construction waste, the overall quantity of construction waste generation in 2024 increased by about 4 945 tonnes per day (11 per cent) as compared to 2023, to 50 505 tonnes per day on average. The quantity of construction waste disposed of at landfills increased slightly by 6 per cent to about 4 694 tonnes per day. The construction activities performed by the main contractors in the same period increased by 6.3% compared to 2023. The overall construction waste recovery rate was above 90 per cent; the average quantity of construction waste reused was 45 810 tonnes per day.

The Government will continue to encourage small-scale works to properly dispose of construction waste in a compliant and paid manner through publicity and education, strengthened enforcement actions, as well as a pilot scheme to assist with collection of construction waste. The EPD also encourages private enterprises to upcycle construction waste into products like eco-blocks, ceramic products and outdoor paving materials. In terms of land, there is an enterprise operating construction waste recycling facilities in the EcoPark, and the EPD has also provided land for short-term lease for the purpose of recycling construction waste. Moreover, the Recycling Fund has also subsidised different enterprises' projects on upcycling of construction waste.

Looking ahead, seizing the opportunity of increasing public participation in waste reduction and recycling, the Government will further promote a green waste reduction and recycling culture in society and will take forward waste reduction and recycling initiatives along four directions, namely: (1) Strengthen publicity and education to change public behaviour and cultivate a green living culture; (2) Continue to enhance the recycling network; (3) Strengthen collaboration with industries to explore and take forward practical environmental protection measures; (4) Utilise market forces to develop environmental infrastructure and assist in the transition to a green economy.

In the meantime, the Government is building an advanced and efficient network of modern waste-to-energy facilities at full steam. The first waste-to-energy facility for treating municipal solid waste, Integrated Waste Management Facilities Phase 1 (I·PARK1), commenced operation at the end of this year; and the Government is also working in full steam on the preparation work for Integrated Waste Management Facility Phase 2 (I·PARK2) to expand waste-to-energy capacity. The goal is to achieve zero landfill with the efforts of the HKSAR Government and citizens.

The report and ""Hong Kong 2024 Municipal Solid Waste - At a Glance"" are both available in electronic format and can be obtained from the EPD website at www.wastereduction.gov.hk/en/assistancewizard/waste_red_sat.htm."

香港都市固體廢物棄置量連續三年下跌，二○二四年為385萬公噸，平均每日10 510公噸，較二○二三年的每日10 884公噸減少3.4%。當中廢塑膠減少了11.1%；廚餘減少了6.0%；玻璃則下跌了7.1%。而都市固體廢物人均棄置量為每日1.40公斤，比二○二三年的每日1.44公斤按年下跌3.3%。在二○二四年棄置的都市固體廢物三大類別中，廚餘佔29%，其次是廢紙及廢塑膠，分別佔23%及18%。

隨着政府近年積極推行各項廚餘回收措施和推動多項「走塑」措施，包括二○二四年實施管制即棄塑膠法例，廚餘及廢塑膠所佔比重均較二○二三年下降。廢塑膠棄置量的跌幅亦正好反映近年全球「走塑」意識日益提升，以及政府積極推動多項相關措施的成效。政府二○二二年十二月三十一日優化塑膠購物袋收費計劃，二○二四年的數字顯示購物膠袋棄置量持續下降至56408公噸，較二○二三年的63367公噸減少11%。與此同時，廢紙的比重有所增加，主要是難以回收的雜紙。

都市固體廢物回收率連續四年上升，最新由二○二三年的33%升至二○二四年的34%，總回收量增加約5.0萬公噸，增長主要由廚餘（約2.6萬公噸）及含鐵金屬（約5.3萬公噸）所帶動。

環保署發言人指，為達致二○三五年「全民減廢‧資源循環‧零廢堆填」的願景，本屆政府著力推動綠色減廢回收文化，透過「綠在區區」社區回收網絡及廚餘回收網絡，推動市民積極參與減廢回收。最新統計數字顯示本屆政府成功扭轉廢物棄置量長期上升的趨勢，而回收率則持續上升，政府推動減廢回收的努力均取得顯著成效。

至於建築廢物方面，二○二四年建築廢物整體產生量較二○二三年每日增加約4 945公噸（11%）至平均每日50 505公噸。送往堆填區處理的建築廢物量輕微增加約6%，至約每日4 694公噸。同期主要承建商所完成的建造工程活動亦較二○二三年上升6.3%。然而，整體建築廢物重用率已超過90%，為平均每日45 810公噸。

政府會繼續透過宣傳教育、強化執法行動以及協助小型工程收集建築廢物的先導計劃，鼓勵小型工程將建築廢物作合規及付費的妥善棄置。環保署亦鼓勵私人企業將建築廢物升級再造，製成如環保磚、陶瓷製品及戶外鋪地等材料。土地方面，現時環保園已有企業營運建築廢物循環再造設施，環保署亦有為回收再用建築廢物提供短期租約用地。此外，回收基金亦資助不同企業的建築廢物升級再造項目。

展望未來，政府會把握愈來愈多市民參與減廢回收的契機，進一步推動社會建立綠色減廢回收文化，並會循四個方向繼續推動減少廢物和分類回收，包括（一）多用宣傳教育，改變市民行為，打造綠色生活文化；（二）持續完善回收網絡；（三）緊密與行業協作，共同探索和推進務實可行的環境保護措施；以及（四）善用市場力量發展環境基建，協助綠色經濟轉型。

同時，政府正全力發展先進高效的現代轉廢為能設施網絡，首座處理都市固體廢物的轉廢為能設施I·PARK1於今年年底開始陸續投入服務；政府亦正全力推展第二座轉廢為能設施I·PARK2的籌備工作，擴大轉廢為能的容量，配合特區政府推動市民努力實踐減廢回收，向「零廢堆填」的目標穩步邁進。

​運輸及物流局局長與路政署署長就中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後首個工作天交通情況會見傳媒談話內容,2025-12-22 12:55,2025-12-22 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200332.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十二月二十二日）上午視察中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後首個工作天交通情況後，與路政署署長邱國鼎會見傳媒的談話內容：

運輸及物流局局長：早晨，各位傳媒朋友、各位市民。中九龍繞道（油麻地段）昨日（十二月二十一日）通車，今日迎來首個工作天，至今已有逾五萬車次使用中九龍繞道（油麻地段）。我看到今早的交通情況大致暢順，符合預期。由於繞道扮演分流的角色，亦能貫穿九龍區東、西走向的交通道路，所以我們觀察到加士居道天橋、龍翔道一帶九龍區主要幹道的交通情況有很明顯改善，相當暢順。運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心自星期六（十二月二十日）晚上已提升至最高級別的督導模式，至今一直監察着整體交通狀況，我們一定會繼續密切留意交通情況。

我們留意到昨日繞道通車後，不少駕駛人士和公共交通車輛均有使用繞道，初時大家都需要多適應路況，亦要留意指示牌。公共交通方面，今日起有八條專營巴士路線途經繞道，至今已有16班巴士開出，包括由將軍澳往機場的數班機場巴士，乘客量不俗。我在此再次呼籲大家，使用繞道時一定要確保道路安全。我稍後會請路政署署長向大家匯報，我們經考慮整日的運作情況後，如何在交通路牌和指示方面作出優化和加強。

路政署署長：如局長剛才提到，中九龍繞道（油麻地段）其實是一條策略性道路，每邊無論在油麻地方向及啟德九龍灣方向，其實都有多個出口，每邊達到四個出口。我們看到昨日都真是需要時間讓駕駛者適應，初步看到昨日駕駛者（遇到的情況），其實最主要在中九龍繞道啟德九龍灣段出口，我們建議有三大改善方向。

第一，由於有四個出口，從左邊往啟德九龍灣，然後觀塘繞道，跟着兩條線去郵輪碼頭，雖然我們本來有足夠指示交通標誌，但我們決定為了方便駕駛者看到，我們會在路面做多一個道路標記，就是加在路面四條行車線上，就是左邊的啟德九龍灣、觀塘繞道和兩個往郵輪碼頭。我們會髹兩組，第一組剛剛在昨晚已大部分完成。第二組在差不多近行政大樓，會於今晚完成。即是說，明早除兩組交通標誌外，還有道路標記，提醒駕駛者選定適當行車線。

第二，大家留意到在啟福道，由於在啟德隧道出來的車輛已經不能再直接上觀塘繞道，而是要經常怡道及宏照道到觀塘繞道。我們留意到有些車輛入了巴士線再上觀塘繞道。我們在巴士線前加了一對警告交通標誌，是紅底白字的一對（標誌）於兩旁，提醒（駕駛者）前面有巴士專線，其他車輛不准駛入。我們看到今早的情況，配合警察執法，情況已有改善。

第三，在九龍灣方面。九龍灣入口處，有兩條隧道供駕駛者選擇，分別是啟德隧道及中九龍繞道。由於有兩個隧道標誌，我們會再在適當位置提醒（駕駛者有）該兩條隧道（選擇），譬如是去油麻地、啟德，或者經啟德隧道，可能會標示所經的隧道。

這三大改善方向我們會繼續做，如剛才所述，第二組道路標記會在今晚完成；啟福道巴士線交通標誌已經完成；而提醒（駕駛者）選用隧道的指示交通標誌，我們希望在這幾日短時間內加強。

記者：繞道落成後，估計由西隧經中九龍幹線進入觀塘的車流量是多少？如果車流不多，會否考慮開放啟福道右線，改劃為單白線，讓啟德隧道車輛駛上觀塘繞道？

運輸及物流局局長：今日是中九龍繞道（油麻地段）開通第二日，是一個工作天，由於臨近年底，部分學校或已開始放假，所以我們要密切留意實際交通情況。正如路政署署長剛才提到，繞道的啟德出口有接近八個出口，我們要做好分流。在啟德方面，尤其是啟福道及通往九龍灣區域方面，我們亦就相應路口和交通燈作出調整，並及早準備預案，以配合調整的路線。我們會繼續密切留意交通情況，期望道路使用者能因應出行需要，享受暢順的交通安排。

記者：剛才訪問了一些巴士乘客，今日是通車後首個工作天，他們表示巴士在進入繞道前有慢行和輕微擠塞的情況，並非他們預期之內。現時正值年底，小朋友不用上學，會否擔心未來分流的效果未如理想，繞道會出現擠塞？政府屆時會有甚麼應對措施？另外，昨日有意見反映路牌的文字較多及較細，除了地面會再加標示外，路牌會否有改善？

運輸及物流局局長：中九龍繞道（油麻地段）是一條主要的分流幹道，由於車速高，且屬一條直接連接的幹道，能發揮很好的分流功能，有很大吸引力。繞道通車後，使油麻地至啟德的車程由以往30分鐘大大縮減至五分鐘，因此在最初規劃繞道時，我們已預期會有一定的交通需求。整體而言，繞道日後會實施收費安排。目前我們因應繁忙時段加設專營巴士路線途經繞道，為市民提供兩個選擇：部分專營巴士的路線會經繞道行駛，亦有路線經太子道或亞皆老街，讓乘客可有不同選擇。整體交通情況是動態的，路政署及運輸署會繼續密切留意交通情況及乘客需求，以便我們更好地作出回應及優化交通安排。

記者：留意到今早有警員在啟福道巴士線截停一些違例車輛，現時警察會如何處理，會提出勸喻抑或執法？既然這麼多車輛需要由啟福道上觀塘繞道，會否改善這個問題？另外，我們看到有很多車輛在啟德出口行錯路、切雙白線的情況，會否考慮加設緩衝區和劃多些虛線，使車輛可以及早改道，以改善情況？

運輸及物流局局長：關於啟德出口，我們昨晚已在隧道內路面加強標示，讓駕駛者可預早留意到交通路牌，從而選取適合的路線。我們亦已在隧道出口，即啟福道附近加裝一些警告標示，讓駕駛者留意，以避免錯誤駛進巴士專線。我們很感謝警方一直配合繞道的通車，並在通車後首個工作天安排警員協助留意現場情況，最主要是確保道路安全。我們會繼續審視情況，未來一、兩日持續和加快優化及加強路牌指示的安排。我亦很感謝團隊能快速作出應變。

記者：有關巴士專線方面，不少司機反映設計造成不便，他們似乎並非不知道巴士專線的安排，而是貪快而越過雙白線。其實這個設計的原本目的是甚麼？車輛要駛至九龍灣MegaBox的位置才出觀塘繞道，會否擔心加劇MegaBox附近塞車情況？

運輸及物流局局長：首先，巴士專線是為確保專營巴士的出行安全，我在此呼籲駕駛者要留意巴士專線的安排，注意駕駛安全。我們已加設警示路牌，正正能協助駕駛者避免錯誤地切入巴士專線。藉着中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車，我們在啟福道作的分流安排，是為改善九龍灣MegaBox一帶以往出現的交通擠塞情況。運輸署和路政署於數月前已分別在該處一帶作出交通改善措施，調整交通燈訊號，希望車輛駛入九龍灣地段時會較以往暢順，這亦回應了過去一些地區人士提出的意見，今次我們則一併去做。始終今日仍是通車第二日，我們希望駕駛人士保持耐性、小心出行。我們會一直觀察他們的駕駛情況，密切和動態地留意安排。接下來隨着交通標示的加強，交通情況有望更安全和暢順。

Remarks by STL on traffic conditions on first working day following commissioning of Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) at media session,2025-12-22 12:55,2025-12-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200324.htm,"Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at a media session today (December 22) with the Director of Highways, Mr Tony Yau, after inspecting the traffic conditions on the first working day following the commissioning of the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section):

Secretary for Transport and Logistics: Following the successful commissioning of the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) yesterday, by now we have seen a total of 50 000 vehicles of traffic throughput at this bypass. The overall traffic condition is smooth. We noticed a significant improvement in the diversion effect of the bypass in improving the traffic conditions along the Gascoigne Road Flyover and other major roads in the Kowloon district. We appeal to various road users to take care of road safety and to pay attention to the road signs. In general, the usage of the bypass is smooth.

As we can see from media reports, there were different kinds of road users using the bypass yesterday, including pet buses, open-deck buses and motorcyclists. From media reports, we can also see that every citizen shared the joy and excitement of using this bypass. The successful launch of this bypass represents not only a significant improvement in the traffic conditions but also the ingenious efforts of various engineers, contractors and consultants throughout the years in constructing and designing this infrastructure.

In particular, we have to thank the Legislative Council for providing staunch support for us in monitoring the overall construction of this infrastructure. We have invited previous, incumbent and also Members-elect of the Legislative Council to our ceremony yesterday. With the success of the Legislative Council election, we look forward to continuing our collaboration with the Members-elect of the Legislative Council in order to further improve the development of traffic infrastructure in Hong Kong, which is very important to the economic development of the whole society.

Thank you very much.

"DH accepts applications for one-on-one pre-new drug application meetings under ""1+"" mechanism",2025-12-22 12:28,2025-12-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200283.htm,"  The Department of Health (DH) announced today (December 22) that potential applicants for new drugs registration through the ""1+"" mechanism may now request one-on-one pre-new drug application (NDA) meetings with immediate effect. This service aims to further optimise the new drug registration approval process by working with the pharmaceutical industry to achieve the goals of early consultation to enhance quality and efficiency throughout the process so that registration approval can be expedited in Hong Kong. It will consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub.

Consultation service for new drug applications under ""1+"" mechanism
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The introduction of the consultation service under the ""1+"" mechanism will enhance efficiency in processing applications. The consultation service comprises three components, namely briefing seminars, workshops and pre-NDA meetings.
  
  There are two types of pre-NDA meetings that provide tailored services and appropriate support for applicants with different needs. These meetings help potential applicants plan their applications earlier and more comprehensively, while streamlining the submission process. Details are as follows:


Company-oriented: Meetings are specifically for first-time applicants through the ""1+"" mechanism. DH professionals will provide tailored advice and guidance on applicable drug registration categories and application pathways based on the applicant company's profiles and potential registration applications; and
	
Product-specific: Meetings are tailored to specific new drug registration projects. DH professionals will provide concrete advice on the supporting evidence, procedures and documentation required for the particular new drug registration.


Information on how to apply for one-on-one pre-NDA meetings has been uploaded on the ""1+"" mechanism thematic webpage. To encourage the industry to experience the one-on-one pre-NDA meetings, no fees will be charged for this service at this stage. The DH will actively maintain communication with the industry to gather feedback and suggestions regarding the one-on-one pre-NDA meetings.

Since March of this year, the DH has organised seven briefing seminars to brief the trade and stakeholders on the basic requirements and procedures for Hong Kong drug registration under the ""1+"" mechanism. The DH has also organised three workshops to provide guidance and share good practices and real-life experiences on submitting applications through the ""1+"" mechanism. These seminars and workshops have been well received by over 580 representatives from pharmaceutical companies, consultancy firms and research institutes, etc, in and outside Hong Kong. The DH has uploaded the detailed arrangements and briefing materials for the seminar to the thematic webpage on the ""1+"" mechanism. The DH will continue to organise workshops and briefing seminars as needed based on feedback from the industry.

Paving the way towards primary evaluation
------------------------------------------------

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented the ""1+"" mechanism since November 1, 2023, and has extended it to all new drugs from November 1 last year, including all new chemical or biological entities and new indications, and vaccines and advanced therapy products. Under the ""1+"" mechanism, new drugs which are supported by local clinical data and recognised by local relevant experts can be applied for registration in Hong Kong by submitting approval from the drug regulatory authority of one of the reference places (instead of two in the past).

Since the implementation of the ""1+"" mechanism, a total of 16 new drugs have been approved under this mechanism. Seven of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. The DH has been promoting the ""1+"" mechanism through different channels and so far has received more than 700 enquiries from over 180 pharmaceutical companies (including those from the Chinese Mainland and overseas).

  The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address announced that the HKSAR Government will accelerate the reform of the regulatory system for drugs and medical devices. The DH will continue to expedite the ""1+"" mechanism for new drugs by piloting the priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs as recommended by the Hospital Authority for treatment of severe or rare diseases and to accelerate patients' use of the advanced treatments. In addition, the DH will establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of 2026, and will implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases beginning in 2026. These efforts will provide strong momentum for the development and market expansion of the healthcare industry in the HKSAR, the Chinese Mainland, and beyond."

粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所邁進新里程　真實世界研究及應用中心正式成立並同步啓動粵港澳大灣區臨床試驗協作平台,2025-12-22 10:30,2025-12-22 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200199.htm,"醫務衞生局今日（十二月二十二日）公布，由香港特別行政區政府設立並全資擁有的「粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所」（試驗所）正式成立「真實世界研究及應用中心」（中心），並同步啓動「粵港澳大灣區臨床試驗協作平台」（協作平台），標誌着試驗所繼去年與深圳粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗中心以「一所一中心」模式同步成立後，在推動粵港澳大灣區生物醫藥領域協同發展方面再邁出重要一步。

中心將善用香港獨有的醫療數據優勢，提升健康和醫療數據庫的存取與應用，並整合在「港澳藥械通」政策下產生的真實世界數據，以支援創新藥械在香港、內地及海外的註冊申請，加速產品研發、審批及上市。截至今年十二月十日，「港澳藥械通」指定內地醫療機構（共71間）引進港澳已上市藥械品種共140種，包括63種藥品及77種醫療器械，惠及超過1.7萬人次。

為積極推動大灣區多中心臨床試驗與真實世界研究的發展，試驗所早已展開前瞻性部署。其中，試驗所在今年九月九日已經與香港大學李嘉誠醫學院及國際生物製藥公司葛蘭素史克簽署三方合作備忘錄，啓動試驗所首個真實世界數據研究項目。該項目將以香港為起點，並計劃逐步擴展至澳門及深圳等大灣區城市。在該項目下，中心將致力探索運用大灣區醫療數據支持藥物在內地註冊上市的創新路徑，從而加速創新醫療產品的研發與審批進程。項目目前正處於方案籌備階段，預計於明年第二季度正式啓動數據收集，標誌着香港在建設真實世界研究國際樞紐，以及就促進大灣區醫療數據互聯互通方面邁出關鍵一步。

此外，中心會積極推動數據應用以支援實證決策，從而優化治療方案和提升醫療系統效能，並將香港定位為真實世界研究的領先地區與國際樞紐，吸引全球合作與投資。中心的服務範疇包括：（一）利用真實世界數據評估研究可行性及為臨床試驗識別合適的研究中心；（二）為在香港及大灣區其他城市進行的真實世界研究提供全面的一站式項目管理；以及（三）提供真實世界研究領域的專家諮詢、專業培訓與能力建設等。

同步啓動的協作平台是「一所一中心」共同建立的統一服務門戶，旨在整合大灣區臨床試驗資源，為全球的生物醫藥企業、研發機構及研究人員提供一站式服務入口。協作平台將統一處理來自海內外的服務請求，透過構建中的香港臨床試驗資訊平台，按具體需求精準配對合適的研究機構與研究者。平台亦提供涵蓋醫藥學、統計、法規事務及倫理審查的全方位專家諮詢。在此框架下，試驗所將致力推動創新療法的臨床試驗，重點聚焦於罕見病藥、高端腫瘤藥，以及細胞與基因療法等先進療法製品。此外，協作平台亦將擔當多重角色，包括作為收集、儲存和分析真實世界數據的主要樞紐，並推動試點項目；作為資訊中心，建立「大灣區臨床研究人才儲備庫」，提供包括《藥物臨牀試驗質量管理規範》及先進療法等專業培訓課程；長遠更會透過建立深港協同機制，定期交換審查標準，探索倫理審查互認的可能性，以提升審批效率。

試驗所將會更好地結合大灣區的完整生物醫藥技術研發及科技產業鏈，善用國家惠港的特別政策如「港澳藥械通」和相關跨境便利措施，充分發揮香港「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的「超級聯繫人」作用，推動河套成為創新生物醫藥成果轉化「引進來、走出去」的窗口，加快大灣區病人獲得先進診療，發展新質生產力。"
GBA International Clinical Trial Institute reaches new milestone with official establishment of Real-World Study and Application Centre and simultaneous launch of GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform,2025-12-22 10:30,2025-12-22 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/22/P2025122200201.htm,"  The Health Bureau announced today (December 22) that the Greater Bay Area (GBA) International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI), established and wholly owned by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, officially established the Real-World Study and Application Centre (RWSAC), and simultaneously launched the GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform. This marks another significant step forward in promoting the co-ordinated development of the biomedical field in the GBA, following the simultaneous establishment of the GBAICTI and the GBA International Clinical Trials Center in Shenzhen under the ""one institute, one center"" model last year.

  The RWSAC will leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages in medical data to enhance access to and the application of health and medical databases, and integrate real-world data generated under the special measure of using Hong Kong-registered drugs and medical devices used in Hong Kong public hospitals in the GBA (the Measure), with a view to supporting registration applications for innovative drugs and medical devices in Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, thereby accelerating product research and development (R&D), approval and market launch. As of December 10 this year, designated Mainland healthcare institutions (71 in total) under the Measure have introduced a total of 140 drug and medical device products listed in Hong Kong and Macao, comprising 63 drugs and 77 medical devices, benefiting over 17 000 patient visits.

  To actively promote the development of multicentre clinical trials and real-world studies in the GBA, the GBAICTI has already commenced forward-looking planning; such as signing a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding with the LKS Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong and the international biopharmaceutical company GSK on September 9 this year to launch the GBAICTI's first real-world data research project. The project will start in Hong Kong and plans to gradually expand to other GBA cities such as Macao and Shenzhen. The RWSAC will strive to explore innovative pathways for using GBA medical data to support drug registration and market entry on the Mainland under the project, thereby accelerating the R&D and approval processes for innovative medical products. The project is currently in the protocol preparation stage, with data collection expected to officially commence in the second quarter next year, marking a critical step for Hong Kong in becoming an international hub for real-world studies and promoting the interconnectivity of medical data in the GBA.

  In addition, the RWSAC will actively promote data application to support evidence-based decision-making, thereby optimising treatment strategies and enhancing healthcare system efficiency, and position Hong Kong as a leading region and international hub for real-world studies to attract global collaboration and investment. The scope of services of the RWSAC includes: (i) utilising real-world data to assess research feasibility and identify suitable research centres for clinical trials; (ii) providing comprehensive one-stop project management for real-world studies conducted in Hong Kong and other GBA cities; and (iii) offering expert consultation, professional training and capacity building in the field of real-world studies.

  The simultaneously launched Collaboration Platform is a unified service portal jointly established by the ""one institute, one center"", aiming to integrate GBA clinical trial resources and provide a one-stop service entry point for global biomedical enterprises, R&D institutions and researchers. The Collaboration Platform will centrally handle service requests from the Mainland and overseas, and precisely match suitable research institutions and researchers based on specific needs through the Hong Kong Clinical Trial Digital Portal currently under construction. The platform also provides comprehensive expert consultation covering medicine, statistics, regulatory affairs and ethics review. Under this framework, the GBAICTI will strive to promote clinical trials of innovative therapies, focusing on rare disease drugs, high-end cancer drugs, and advanced therapy products such as cell and gene therapies. Furthermore, the Collaboration Platform will take on multiple roles, including serving as a key hub for collecting, storing and analysing real-world data and promoting pilot projects; acting as an information centre to establish a GBA clinical research talent pool and providing professional training courses including the Good Clinical Practice and advanced therapies. In the long run, it will help explore the possibility of the mutual recognition of ethics reviews through establishing a Shenzhen-Hong Kong collaborative mechanism and regularly exchanging review standards to enhance approval efficiency.

  The GBAICTI will better integrate with the complete biomedical technology R&D and technology industry chain in the GBA, leverage the nation's special policy initiatives benefitting Hong Kong such as the Measure and relevant cross-boundary facilitation measures, and give full play to Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world. It will promote the Hetao area as a window for translation of innovative biomedical research results to go global and attract foreign investment, expedite GBA patients' access to advanced treatments, and develop new quality productive forces."

A male passenger, aged 23, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds concealed inside vacuum-sealed bags in his check-in suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (December 22).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

被捕人士已被控一項販運危險藥物罪，案件將於明日（十二月二十二日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-21 17:30,2025-12-21 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/21/P2025122100479.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月二十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。本港今年累計錄得81宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應近期有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。鑑於中心與相關政府部門近期會在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。

中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。全港醫生及醫院應留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-21 17:30,2025-12-21 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/21/P2025122100481.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 21), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

HA clarifies survey on family medicine and primary healthcare consultations,2025-12-21 15:24,2025-12-21 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/21/P2025122100366.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) today (December 21) clarified regarding a survey conducted by the Society for Community Organization about family medicine and primary healthcare consultations. The HA noted that over 60 per cent of respondents were Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) recipients or Old Age Living Allowance (OALA) recipients, and the survey indicated that most respondents were concerned about the impact of public healthcare fees and charges reform on their willingness to seek medical consultation. The HA emphasises that the fees and charges reform will not affect the current approximately 600 000 individuals eligible for full fee waivers (including CSSA recipients, OALA recipients aged 75 or above, and Residential Care Service Voucher holders at co-payment Level 0). Their full fee waivers will automatically continue after the fees and charges reform implementation on January 1 next year. In fact, one of the key measures of the public healthcare fees and charges reform is to expand the current medical fee waiver mechanism, increasing the number of eligible beneficiaries outside these three social welfare schemes from the current 300 000 to 1.4 million people, which is 1.1 million people additional, bringing the total number of beneficiaries to nearly 2 million.

Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs) primarily serve two types of patients: chronic disease patients with stable conditions (such as diabetes) and patients with mild episodic illnesses (such as common cold). Chronic disease patients will be arranged follow-up appointments after consultation, requiring no self-booking. Patients with episodic illnesses can book appointments for morning, afternoon, or evening sessions within the next 24 hours through telephone or the ""HA Go"" application. The booking system operates round the clock and updates available slots in real time, including cancelled appointments.

As a safety net for vulnerable groups, the HA has repositioned FMCs according to the Government's Primary Healthcare Blueprint, focusing on providing comprehensive preventive services for low-income families and underprivileged elderly. Consultation duration is adjusted based on patients' clinical conditions. To cope with demand, the HA continues to increase quotas, with new clinics in North District and Tseung Kwan O South commencing services in 2024 and 2025. The number of clinics providing holiday services has increased to 15 in 2025, with plans to further increase quotas and explore extended service hours in 2026-27.

Additionally, the government launched the ""Family Medicine Out-patient Priority Groups Pilot Scheme"" in November 2025, covering specific groups including elderly aged 65 or above, CSSA recipients, and Working Family Allowance beneficiaries. Approximately 800 000 individuals can make priority booking for episodic illness consultation services."
