行政長官會同行政會議批准北環線項目第一部分的財務安排（附圖）,2025-07-08 19:09,2025-07-08 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800439.htm,"行政長官會同行政會議今日（七月八日）批准北環線項目第一部分的財務安排。運輸及物流局與香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）隨後簽訂第一部分項目協議。

北環線項目是支撐香港未來發展的重點運輸基建。北環線主線將成為北部都會區多個新發展區的公共運輸骨幹，配合沿線發展新增人口的運輸需求，提供高效可靠的鐵路服務。而與深圳透過港深跨界軌道基礎設施建設專班攜手推進的北環線支線，則會作為北環線的跨境分支連通港深地鐵網絡，接入新皇崗口岸並提供便捷的「一地兩檢」通關模式，助力香港更好融入國家發展。

為加快推展北環線項目，政府早前與港鐵公司簽訂古洞站項目協議時，已同時要求港鐵公司預留就北環線主線進行詳細規劃及設計和部分前期工程的相關預算。現時相關詳細規劃及設計工作包括法定程序已大致完成，前期工程亦已經開展。

政府發言人表示：「北環線項目的策略價值重大。政府發揮敢於破局的決心，果斷作出了三大突破，為項目提速提效。」

「第一，我們以全盤規劃、分段推展的策略推進北環線項目，將北環線支線連同主線合併作為一個項目進行規劃，以實現協同效益並節省成本。項目再分成兩部分推展以加快進度。現階段簽訂的第一部分項目協議可立即推動項目進展，並同步進行北環線支線的詳細規劃及設計和法定程序。」

「第二，秉持不斷創新的精神，我們正推行多項降低成本和加快建造的策略，並會成熟一項推一項，包括因應項目的跨境元素善用內地方式和能力建造，並在路政署設立專責小組處理審批，精簡項目整體流程和加快程序。這些措施不但可助提高跨境的北環線支線的建造效率，亦有望在一定程度上惠及北環線主線。」

「第三，按照以結果為目標的思維，我們通過引入與鐵路建造相關的內地標準、做法和資源提升建造效率，將北環線支線的規劃大幅提前，目標是與主線在二○三四年或之前同步開通，即較北環線支線原先估計的時間表提早約兩年。」

政府在獨立審核顧問的協助下，已嚴謹審視港鐵公司就北環線項目第一部分提供的財務預算，核實的項目預算約為314億元（按二○二五年七月價格計算）。

行政長官會同行政會議批准，採用「鐵路加物業」模式向港鐵公司批出錦上路站第二期、粉嶺北第13區（東）及第16區、古洞北第22區（東）、第26區（西）、第14區及第15區，和新田第4D區、第6A區及第2A區的用地作住宅及商業用途發展，將來會從按「設有鐵路」基礎評定的十足市值地價中，扣除一筆總數為390億5,000萬元的固定總額（按付款當日價格計算），作為對港鐵公司推展北環線項目第一部分的財務資助。

政府今日與港鐵公司簽訂的第一部分項目協議，會立即啓動較成熟和較迫切的工程，包括北環線主線當中由錦上路站通往牛潭尾車廠連接隧道和由新田站通往古洞站的兩段土木及結構工程，同時要求港鐵公司同步進行北環線支線的詳細規劃及設計，包括環境評估和鐵路方案刊憲等法定程序，並爭取以最快的速度完成。當相關法定程序完成後，便會盡快簽訂第二部分項目協議落實餘下的工程和營運安排。"

Chief Executive in Council approves financial arrangement for Part 1 of Northern Link Project,2025-07-08 19:08,2025-07-08 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800440.htm,"The Chief Executive in Council approved today (July 8) the financial arrangement for Part 1 of the Northern Link (NOL) Project. The Transport and Logistics Bureau and the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) have executed the Part 1 Project Agreement (PA) subsequently.

The NOL Project is a key transport infrastructure in support of the future development of Hong Kong. The NOL Main Line would become the public transportation backbone for multiple new development areas in the Northern Metropolis, providing efficient and reliable railway services to meet the transport demand from new population along the railway alignment. The NOL Spur Line, which is being taken forward together with Shenzhen through the Task Force for Hong Kong-Shenzhen Co-operation on Cross-Boundary Railway Infrastructure, would be a cross-boundary bifurcation of the NOL linking the metro networks of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, connecting to the new Huanggang Port through convenient co-location clearance arrangements and facilitating Hong Kong's better integration into the national development.

To expedite the implementation of the NOL Project, the Government already required the MTRCL to reserve relevant budget to undertake the detailed planning and design as well as part of the advance works for the NOL Main Line when executing the PA of the Kwu Tung Station with the MTRCL earlier. The relevant detailed planning and design including statutory procedures have been substantially completed and the advance works have also commenced.

A Government spokesman said, ""The NOL Project embodies significant strategic value. With a strong determination to break new ground, the Government has resolutely decided to make three major breakthroughs to enhance the speed and efficiency of the project.

  ""Firstly, we would take forward the NOL Project through a holistic planning and staged implementation strategy, planning the NOL Spur Line in combination with the NOL Main Line as one project to achieve synergies and realise cost savings. The project would be implemented under a two-part approach to expedite progress. The execution of Part 1 PA at this juncture could propel the project forward immediately, and in parallel carry out the detailed planning and design as well as statutory procedures for the NOL Spur Line.

  ""Secondly, in the spirit of innovating continuously, we are pursuing various strategies for reducing cost and accelerating project delivery, which would be implemented as soon as ready. Such strategies include leveraging Mainland approaches and capabilities in construction on account of the cross-boundary element of the project, and setting up a dedicated team in the Highways Department to handle building submissions in a manner which streamlines the overall project workflow and expedites procedures. These initiatives will not only improve the construction efficiency of the cross-boundary NOL Spur Line, but may also benefit the NOL Main Line to a certain extent.

  ""Thirdly, adopting a result-oriented mindset, we would improve the construction efficiency through adopting railway-related Mainland standards, practices and resources, substantially bringing forward the planning of the NOL Spur Line. The target is to commission the NOL Spur Line together with the NOL Main Line by 2034 or earlier, which is about two years earlier than what was originally envisaged.""

The Government, supported by an independent checking consultant, has critically examined the financial estimates provided by the MTRCL in relation to Part 1 of the NOL Project, and verified that the capital cost estimate is about $31.4 billion (in July 2025 prices).

The Chief Executive in Council approved the grant of sites at Kam Sheung Road Station Phase 2; Fanling North Area 13 (East) and Area 16; Kwu Tung North Area 22 (East), Area 26 (West), Area 14 and Area 15; as well as San Tin Area 4D, Area 6A and Area 2A to the MTRCL for residential and commercial development under the ""Rail-plus-Property"" model. A total fixed lump sum of $39.05 billion (in money-of-the-day prices) would be deducted from the full market value land premium of the sites assessed on a ""with-railway"" basis in the future as funding support to the MTRCL in implementing Part 1 of the NOL Project.

The execution of the Part 1 PA between the Government and the MTRCL today would immediately kick-start works that are more ready and time-critical, including the civil and structural works of two sections of the NOL Main Line from the Kam Sheung Road Station to the intersection with the approach tunnels to Ngau Tam Mei Depot and from the San Tin Station to the Kwu Tung Station. The MTRCL is required to carry out the detailed planning and design of the NOL Spur Line simultaneously, including statutory procedures relating to the environmental impact assessment and railway scheme gazettal, and strive for completion as early as possible. The Part 2 PA would be executed to finalise the arrangements for the remaining works and operation as soon as possible after completion of the relevant statutory procedures."

Opening remarks by Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services) at Deloitte's Digital Asset Forum (English only) (with photos),2025-07-08 18:40,2025-07-08 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800687.htm,"  Following are the opening remarks by the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services), Ms Salina Yan, at the Deloitte's Digital Asset Forum ""Digital Assets in Focus - Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance in Hong Kong"" today (July 8):

Eliza (Senior Advisor of Deloitte China Dr Eliza Chan), Duncan (Legislative Council member (Technology and Innovation) Mr Duncan Chiu), Robert (Hong Kong Digital Asset leader of Deloitte China, Mr Robert Lui), friends from the digital asset sector, ladies and gentlemen,

 The Forum today is very timely, as we are standing at a pivotal moment when economies worldwide are striving to chart the course for digital assets and oversight of their use. Hong Kong has been working diligently to stay ahead of the curve in building an ecosystem for the healthy development of the digital asset sector.

 As you know, back in 2022, we announced our first policy statement on digital assets, or virtual assets at the time, setting out our vision to create that comprehensive ecosystem under the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"". Then in June 2023, we put in place a licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms. Now we have a total of 11 licensees with local and international backgrounds. Nine exchange-traded funds with digital underlying assets have also been listed. In May this year, with the support of the Legislative Council, we enacted the Stablecoins Ordinance, making Hong Kong one of the few economies in the world to have a comprehensive law in place on stablecoin issuance. The Ordinance is scheduled to come into effect on August 1, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will begin to accept licence applications.

 This solid groundwork serves as a springboard for the next phase of digital asset development in Hong Kong. The ""LEAP"" framework or metaphor embodied in the second policy statement issued on June 26 conveys a proactive and forward-looking approach. To recap, ""L"" stands for legal and regulatory streamlining, ""E"" for expanding the suite of tokenised products, ""A"" for advancing use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and ""P"" is people and partnership development. These are linked to Hong Kong's unique advantages as an international financial centre, including our comprehensive legal system, sophisticated financial market and infrastructure, close connection with the international markets, and a wealth of professional talents.

 A lot of you are interested in the application scenarios or the ""E"" and ""A"" in the statement. A lot can be said on this. For now, I believe that as a well-developed financial market with a wide range of financial instruments and assets available for trading, Hong Kong has great potential to promote tokenisation of RWA (Real-World Assets). For example, Hong Kong is in a very good position to develop tokenised government bonds, building on our two landmark tokenised government green bond issuances in the past two years and Hong Kong's status as a leading bond issuance hub in Asia. The first batch totalling HK$800 million issued in 2023 was the first tokenised green bond issued by a government entity. The second batch, issued in 2024 denominated in Renminbi, Hong Kong dollars, Euro and US dollars and totalling close to HK$6 billion equivalent, was the world's first multi-currency digitally native green bonds. As announced in the 2025-26 Budget, the Government will regularise the issuance of tokenised bonds.

 I am sure that there are many good ideas about RWA out there in the marketplace. To encourage market participation in developing use cases, thanks to Cyberport, a funding scheme has been launched to support the development of high-impact applications with potential to serve as future use case benchmark.

 On the legal regulatory front or ""L"", right on the next day following the promulgation of the second policy statement, we launched a public consultation on the licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers. This is another big step in making the regulatory regime comprehensive, thus enabling us to manage the risks and harness the potential in different activities along the digital asset value chain, from issuance, trading and dealing, to post-trade custodian service. The two-month consultation period will end in late August. Do let us have your views.

 On the people and partnership front or ""P"", we value stakeholder engagement, and we walk the talk. At the policy level, the Financial Secretary is chairing the Task Force on Promoting Web3 Development. At the regulator level, the Securities and Futures Commission has established a consultative panel focusing on market and regulatory issues. The panel just held its second meeting yesterday. Fora like the one today will certainly provide useful feedback for our work.

 Our policy stance on digital assets is clear. We strive to embrace financial innovations so as to capture their potential benefits, but at the same time we need to put in risk management guardrails with emphasis on investor protection and user education. With this, we look forward to hearing your feedback, and I wish you fruitful discussions. Thank you."

粵港澳三地在廣州聯辦十五運會和殘特奧會「開放共享、攜手並進」新聞發布會（附圖）,2025-07-08 18:30,2025-07-08 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800736.htm,"第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）廣東賽區執行委員會、香港特別行政區政府全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室（全運會統籌辦）和十五運會和殘特奧會澳門賽區籌備辦公室今日（七月八日）在廣州舉行以「開放共享、攜手並進」為主題的新聞發布會，介紹十五運會和殘特奧會粵港澳三地賽區的賽事籌備情況，以及未來工作計劃。

十五運會組織委員會辦公室主任、廣東省人民政府副秘書長黃明忠、全運會統籌辦主任楊德強和十五運會及殘特奧會澳門賽區籌備辦公室主任潘永權分別在會上發言，分享粵港澳三地聯動辦會的階段成果。香港單車運動員黃金寶和澳門武術運動員李禕亦有出席簡介會，分享他們對十五運會的期盼。

黃明忠在發布會上表示，粵港澳三地攜手共同承辦十五運會，在國家體育總局、中央港澳辦等國家部委的指導下，建立了具開創性的粵港澳聯絡機制。通過高密度的溝通協商，在六大重點領域達成共識，包括跨境賽事、口岸通關、人車證件、食品安全、綠色辦賽和賽事日程。三地探索出一個「三地三同」的聯合辦賽模式，也就是「同頻溝通、同心決策、同步執行」。

楊德強表示：「香港賽區一直遵循『綠色、共享、開放、廉潔』的辦賽理念，按照『簡約、安全、精彩』的辦賽要求，嚴格做好預算管理，節約成本，控制賽事規模，務實做好各項籌備工作。」他又提到，由香港協辦的田徑馬拉松及公路自行車賽事將會是今屆全運會的亮點。兩個跨境賽事從比賽路線的設計到運動員、觀眾和車輛的快速通關，每一個細節都需要三地政府的共同籌劃和密切配合。這種跨地域的合作模式，不僅提升了大灣區的整體競爭力，亦同時促進大灣區民心交流。黃金寶表示，以港珠澳大橋作賽道舉辦跨境公路自行車賽具標誌性，風景不但優美，賽道亦充滿挑戰。

潘永權表示，全運會籌備工作已進入倒數階段，將與社會各界聯手做好賽事的組織工作，並加強營造全民全運的城市氛圍，包括繼續走訪社區和學校、聯動其他文、旅、體活動進行宣傳、推出澳門賽區特許紀念商品等。

粵港澳三地亦即場展示多款特許經營商品，並由設計師闡述其創作理念。香港賽區稍後將陸續在全港不同地區設銷售點，售賣十五運會和殘特奧會的紀念商品，包括具香港特色的特許紀念商品。

Enhancement Arrangements for Offshore RMB Bond Repurchase Business announced by HKMA,2025-07-08 17:15,2025-07-08 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800606.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 8) enhancements to the offshore RMB bond repurchase (repo) business (Note 1), to facilitate the participation of Northbound Bond Connect investors in repo business. In particular, the enhancements include:

1. Supporting the rehypothecation of bond collaterals during the repo period (Note 2):

The offshore RMB repo business has been well received by the market since its official launch on February 10, 2025. In this initial phase, the bond collaterals acquired by participating institutions are locked and managed by the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) platform and cannot be re-used during the repo period. In consultation with relevant Mainland authorities and taking into account industry feedback, we will allow rehypothecation of bond collateral during the repo period, bringing this into alignment with international market practice. The enhancement will facilitate more efficient use of collaterals, reduce the financing costs for market participants, and enhance the efficiency of liquidity management.

In particular, bond collaterals can be re-used during the repo period in four specific use cases: a) for re-use in offshore repo transactions; b) as collateral for the HKMA's RMB Liquidity Facility; c) as margin collateral at OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited (OTCC); and d) for cash bond trading through Northbound Bond Connect. Participating institutions shall follow relevant policies and operational rules for the respective use cases when re-using the collateral (for instance, if the collateral is re-used in a new offshore repo transaction during the repo period, the participating institution should follow the latest arrangements of offshore RMB repo business as set out further below).

2. Supporting cross-currency repo (including HKD, USD and EUR):

At present, offshore RMB repo can only be settled in RMB. With the enhancement, settlement in other currencies (including HKD, USD and EUR) will be supported, with a view to facilitating participating institutions' multi-currency funding activities by collateralising onshore RMB bond holdings, enriching their liquidity management tools, and hence increasing the attractiveness of onshore bonds.

These two enhancement measures aim to adopt international market best practices and enhance operational efficiency. They will further expand the depth and breadth of the offshore repo market, improve the market-based mechanism for offshore RMB liquidity management, and broaden the use of onshore RMB bonds as collateral in the offshore market.

The above arrangements will be officially launched on August 25, 2025.

Latest Arrangements of Offshore RMB Repo Business

To facilitate the smooth implementation of the enhancement measures, the latest arrangements for offshore RMB repo transactions (including repo transactions conducted using bond collateral acquired through a repo transaction) are set out as follows:

1. Participating Institutions:

All existing Northbound Bond Connect investors, including CMU members and offshore investors with CMU sub-accounts opened through Hong Kong custodian banks that are CMU members.

2. Eligible Bonds:

Bonds held by participating institutions under Northbound Bond Connect, and bond collaterals acquired through offshore repo transactions, regardless of bond type.

3. Market Maker Arrangement:

The 11 Primary Liquidity Providers designated by the HKMA (Note 3) will serve as market makers. Each repo transaction must involve at least one of these market makers as a counterparty.

4. Transaction and Settlement Arrangements:

(a)Master Agreement: Participants may choose their own repo agreement template (e.g., Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) or National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII)'s Bond Repurchase Master Agreement, etc.).

(b)Trading Arrangement: Transactions may be conducted:


bilaterally over-the-counter;
in the same manner as existing Northbound Bond Connect transactions, and via the linkage between the infrastructures in the onshore and offshore markets;
through offshore electronic trading platforms; or
through onshore electronic trading platform.


(c)Settlement Arrangement: Settlement will be completed under the Repo Service by CMU. Settlement currencies include RMB, HKD, USD and EUR.

5.Data Reporting:

Market makers are required to report repo transaction data (Note 4) to the HKMA on the same day of the transaction for market monitoring purpose. The HKMA will further communicate with the market makers to finalise the reporting requirements and submission channels.

The operational details for bond transfer and settlement will be announced by CMU separately. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor market conditions to ensure orderly market operations. The HKMA will also maintain communication with the industry and review and adjust the arrangements as appropriate to support the robust and sustainable development of offshore RMB business.

Note 1: The HKMA announced the launch of offshore RMB bond repo business on January 13, 2025 (please refer to the HKMA press release). This measure was implemented on February 10, 2025.

Note 2: Operational details will be announced by CMU later. Currently, the rehypothecation of bond collateral is only applicable to repo transactions settled in the Delivery versus Payment model. The timeline for CMU's tri-party repo service to support the rehypothecation of bond collateral will be notified separately in due course.

Note 3: Including 1) Agricultural Bank of China Limited, 2) Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited, 3) Bank of Communications Co., Ltd., 4) BNP Paribas, 5) China CITIC Bank International Limited, 6) China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited, 7) Citibank, N.A., 8) Hang Seng Bank Limited, 9) The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, 10) Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Limited and 11) Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited.

Note 4: The specific information to be reported includes: names of the trading institutions (including both the repo party and the reverse repo party), total amount of funds borrowed by the repo party, bond name, bond code, repo term, total face value, repo rate, transaction/first settlement date, settlement amount, trading platform/means, default-related information etc."
金管局關於離岸人民幣債券回購業務的優化安排,2025-07-08 17:15,2025-07-08 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800614.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月八日）公布有關離岸人民幣債券回購業務（註一）的優化安排，以進一步便利「債券通」（北向通）投資者參與離岸人民幣債券回購業務。具體優化措施包括：

1.支持抵押品債券在回購期間再使用（註二）：

二○二五年二月十日正式推出以來，市場反應積極正面。業務初期，參與機構透過離岸回購交易取得的抵押債券只限於在債務工具中央結算系統（CMU）平台鎖定管理，在回購期間不能再使用。經總結落實以來的經驗和充分考慮市場建議，並與內地監管機構溝通，這次優化措施將按照國際慣例，允許抵押券在回購期間再使用，以提升抵押品使用效率，進一步降低市場機構的融資成本，提升流動性管理效率。

四個使用場景：（a）再次進行離岸回購交易；（b）作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排下的抵押品；（c）作為香港場外結算公司（OTCC）的履約抵押品和（d）通過「債券通」（北向通）進行現券交易。參與機構應遵守各業務場景的相關業務規則和操作規程進行抵押品再使用（例如：若抵押品在回購期間再使用於新的離岸回購交易，則應遵循下述關於離岸人民幣債券回購業務的最新安排要求）。

2.支持外幣結算（包括港元、美元和歐元）：

離岸人民幣回購業務僅限於以人民幣單幣種結算。經本次優化後，可進一步支持多幣種外幣結算，包括港元、美元和歐元，以便利參與機構按實際需要，以持有的在岸人民幣債券持倉進行多幣種資金融通，豐富流動性管理工具，也有助於提升在岸債券的吸引力。

這兩項優化措施旨在對標國際市場慣例、提升市場操作便利，以進一步拓展離岸回購市場的深度和廣度，完善離岸人民幣流動性市場化安排機制，並提升在岸人民幣債券在離岸市場作為抵押品的使用。

上述優化措施將於二○二五年八月二十五日正式啓動。

離岸人民幣債券回購業務的最新安排要求

為便於優化措施的順利推出，現就離岸人民幣債券回購交易，包括利用通過另一宗回購交易取得的抵押債券進行的回購交易，最新安排說明如下：

一、參與機構：

所有已入市的「債券通」（北向通）投資者（包括CMU成員和透過香港託管行CMU成員開立債券通子帳戶的離岸投資者）。

二、合資格債券：

參與機構在「債券通」（北向通）下持有的債券，以及透過離岸回購交易取得的抵押券，不限券種。

三、做市商安排：

由金管局指定的11家一級流動性提供銀行（註三）作為做市商。每筆回購交易應至少有一方交易對手是做市商機構。

四、交易及結算安排：

（a）主協議：允許機構間自行選擇回購協議文本（例如全球回購主協議（GMRA）或中國銀行間市場交易商協會（NAFMII）的債券回購交易主協議等）。

（b）交易方式：可以通過以下方式開展交易：

場外雙邊交易；
採用「債券通」（北向通）交易方式，透過境內外基礎設施聯通方式；
透過境外電子交易平台；或
透過境內電子交易平台。


（c）結算安排：在CMU的回購服務下完成。結算幣種包括人民幣、港元、美元和歐元。

五、信息數據報送：

做市商須於回購交易日當天向金管局報送交易數據（註四），作市場監察用途。金管局將與做市商進一步溝通信息報送的要求和途徑。

有關債券過戶和結算安排的操作詳情將由CMU稍後公布。金管局將繼續密切監察市場情況，確保市場運作穩定有序；並與業界保持溝通，適時檢視進一步優化調整措施，以支持離岸人民幣業務的穩健蓬勃發展。

註一：金管局於二○二五年一月十三日公布推出離岸人民幣債券回購業務（相關詳情請參考金管局新聞稿）。該業務於二○二五年二月十日正式上線。

註二：目前只有以貨銀兩訖模式為結算方式的回購交易可以實現抵押品債券在回購期間再使用，詳情將由CMU稍後公布。CMU的第三方回購服務安排具體何時可以支持抵押品債券再使用將另行通知。

駐成都辦主任袁嘉諾、省港澳辦主任姚紅娟，以及省科協副主席呂建軍首先向來賓和傳媒致歡迎詞。袁嘉諾表示：「國家『十四五』規劃明確支持香港建設國際創新科技中心。陝西省是國家重要的科技工業基地，在能源化工、裝備製造、航空航天等領域實力雄厚。香港和陝西均非常重視創科產業發展，近年來高層互訪頻繁。期待通過深度對接讓香港在稅制、金融、全球網絡等方面的優勢，與陝西的產業根基和創新活力結合，實現『雙向奔赴』。」

姚紅娟亦表示，將積極推動並不斷深化陝港兩地經貿投資，特別是科技創新和新質生產力代表產業的合作交流，協助兩地企業充分把握發展機遇，實現優勢互補。呂建軍隨後於現場致辭。

本次交流會亮點之一，是香港投資推廣署與西安高新區管委會於活動現場簽署合作備忘錄，攜手支持陝西創科企業借港出海，拓展國際市場，標誌陝港兩地在推動中西部地區企業國際化發展方面邁出堅實一步。

西安高新區是國務院首批批准成立的國家級高新區之一。二○二四年，在國家高新區綜合評價中排名全國第五位、位居中西部第一位。區內重點發展光電子資訊、智慧製造、生物醫藥、汽車、新材料新能源等創新產業，成功建立汽車產業、電子資訊兩個千億級產業集群。目前，該區已發展成全球規模最大的閃存晶片生產基地及新能源汽車生產基地。

根據合作備忘錄，西安高新區管委會將鼓勵區內企業利用香港作為拓展海外業務的基地。投資推廣署將提供香港營商環境和政策資訊，以及就企業在港投資和營運提供支援。此次簽署合作備忘錄標誌雙方將建立穩定協作機制，結合香港國際金融中心的獨特優勢與西安高新區的創新動能，助企業連接全球資源，搶佔國際市場先機。

投資推廣署華西地區企業出海專組／招商引才／投資推廣總監干杉立，與西安高新區科技創新局局長高雲天分別代表香港投資推廣署與西安高新區管委會簽署該備忘錄。干杉立簽約後表示：「在發展新質生產力、貢獻國家高品質發展方面，陝港有極大的合作機遇。作為連接內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，香港一直致力為內地創新企業提供全方位支援。希望進一步發揮兩地互補優勢，協助園區內的優質企業借港出海，共同開拓創新合作新機遇。」

投資推廣署創新及科技總裁黃煒卓在推廣香港創科機遇主題演講時表示：「我們擁有多項發展創科的優勢，包括頂尖學術研究與人才庫、世界級研發基礎設施、健全的知識產權保護，以及特區政府的堅定支持。二○二四年，投資推廣署協助的創科公司數量增至120間在香港拓展業務，是該署支援最多的行業，反映出國際對香港創科發展的信心與肯定，也進一步印證香港作為『雙向門戶』的戰略角色。近期，香港創科領域在多方面值得關注，例如首批低空經濟「監管沙盒」試點項目在香港落實，成為推動香港發展的嶄新動力。另外，香港新藥審批機制更新，加速新藥上市進程。我希望陝西省高新科技企業能把握香港多元化機遇，拓展海外市場。」

交流會亦邀請港深創新及科技園有限公司租賃及營運部高級經理談飛，與香港理工大學研究及創新事務處副總監趙培，分享並推介香港創科中心機遇以及香港高校科研創新賦能新質生產力等主題。陝西省西咸新區科技創新和新經濟局副局長韓萍同時分享陝西省創新中心的最新發展。

The event was also co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Chengdu (CDETO), the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's Shaanxi Liaison Unit, Shaanxi Province Xixian New Area Development and Construction Management Committee, and the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone Management Committee.
  
  The Director of the CDETO, Mr Enoch Yuen; the Director-General of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Shaanxi Provincial Government, Ms Yao Hongjuan; and Vice President of the Shaanxi Association for Science and Technology Mr Lv Jianjun delivered welcome remarks to guests and the media. Mr Yuen said, ""The National 14th Five-Year Plan explicitly designates Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology hub, while Shaanxi serves as a key national base for technology and industry, with strong capabilities in energy and chemical engineering, equipment manufacturing, and aerospace, among others. Both Hong Kong and Shaanxi place great importance on the development of the innovation and technology industry, and frequent high-level exchanges between the two places have continued to deepen in recent years. We look forward to deeper collaboration, leveraging Hong Kong's strengths in taxation, finance, and global connectivity, while combining them with Shaanxi's strong industrial foundation and innovative vitality, to achieve a mutually beneficial partnership.""
  
  Ms Yao stated that efforts will be made to actively promote and deepen economic, trade, and investment co-operation between Shaanxi and Hong Kong, particularly in the fields of innovation and technology, as well as new quality productive forces. These efforts aim to help enterprises in both regions seize development opportunities and achieve complementary advantages. Mr Lv also delivered remarks at the event.
  
  One of the key highlights of the event was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between InvestHK and the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone Management Committee, marking a solid step forward for Shaanxi and Hong Kong in promoting the international development of enterprises in the central and western regions.
  
  Xi'an High-tech Zone is one of the first national high-tech zones approved by the State Council.

  Under the MOU, the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone Management Committee will encourage enterprises in the zone to utilise Hong Kong as a base for expanding overseas business. InvestHK will provide enterprises with information on the business environment and policies in Hong Kong, as well as support services for companies investing and operating in Hong Kong. The signing of this MOU establishes a structured collaboration framework, combining Hong Kong's unique strengths as an international financial centre and Xi'an High-Tech Zone's innovation capabilities to empower enterprises in accessing global resources efficiently and seizing early opportunities in international markets.
  
  The Head of the Go Global Unit/Business and Talent Attraction/Investment Promotion of Western China of InvestHK, Mr Jason Gan, and the Director of the Science and Technology Innovation Bureau of the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone, Mr Gao Yuntian, signed the memorandum of co-operation on behalf of their respective sides. Mr Gan said after the signing, ""There are tremendous opportunities for co-operation between Shaanxi and Hong Kong in developing new quality productive forces and contributing to China's high-quality development. As a vital bridge between the Mainland and international markets, Hong Kong has long been committed to providing comprehensive support for Mainland innovation-driven enterprises. We hope to further leverage the complementary advantages of the two places to assist high-quality enterprises in the zone to go global via Hong Kong, and work together to explore new innovative co-operation.""
  
  The Head of Innovation & Technology of InvestHK, Mr Andy Wong, delivered a keynote speech and highlighted Hong Kong's competitive edge in the I&T sector. ""We possess a number of competitive advantages in developing innovation and technology, including world-class academic research and talent, cutting-edge R&D infrastructure, robust intellectual property protection, and the strong support of the HKSAR Government. In 2024, InvestHK supported 120 innovation and technology companies to set up or expand in Hong Kong, making it the top sector among those we assisted. This reflects the international community's confidence in and recognition of Hong Kong's I&T development, and further affirms the city's strategic role as a two-way platform between the Mainland and global markets. Hong Kong's innovation and technology sector has recently made remarkable progress in several areas. For example, the first batch of regulatory sandbox pilot projects for the low-altitude economy has been launched, serving as a new engine for Hong Kong's future development. In addition, the city's new drug approval mechanism has been updated to accelerate the market entry of new pharmaceuticals. I sincerely hope that I&T enterprises in Shaanxi will seize the diverse opportunities offered by Hong Kong to expand into international markets,"" he said.

  Senior Manager of the Leasing and Operations Department of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park Limited Mr Tandy Tan and Associate Director of the Research and Innovation Office of Hong Kong Polytechnic University Mr Victor Zhao also shared the opportunities of the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Center and highlighted Hong Kong's R&D capabilities in empowering new quality productive forces raised from Hong Kong universities. Deputy Director of the Science, Technology Innovation and New Economy Bureau, Shaanxi Province Xixian New Area Ms Han Ping also shared the latest developments on Shaanxi's I&T industry construction centre.
  
  This event featured a panel discussion with industry leaders from professional services in Hong Kong, especially in financial professional services. Guest speakers from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, HSBC and Deloitte Tax shared insights on how Hong Kong's financial and professional services can accelerate Mainland firms' global expansion.
  
  The seminar included a dedicated exchange session to provide on-site consulting services for corporate representatives interested in expanding to Hong Kong. The event attracted 190 representatives from Shaanxi enterprises, institutions and local media."

霍震霆會長（中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會會長）、衞校長（香港浸會大學校長衞炳江）、周博士（中國香港大專體育協會會長代表、香港樹仁大學行政副校長周德生博士）、侯團長（中國香港大專體育協會2023-2025大學生運動會籌委會主席暨團長侯耀忠）、各位嘉賓、各位運動員、各位朋友：

大家午安。我今日很高興出席授旗儀式，為即將出戰第32屆世界大學生運動會的健兒壯行助威。

大學生運動會是僅次於奧運會的綜合性世界運動會，歷屆比賽均是高手雲集、競爭激烈，今屆比賽亦不例外。來自150個國家及地區的頂尖學生運動員，將會齊聚德國萊茵魯爾，在18個運動項目展開連場精彩的對決，實在令人非常期待。

今年，中國香港將會派出75名健將出戰10個項目。經過長年累月的刻苦訓練，我相信各位運動員早已蓄勢待發。我今日看見你們每一個精神抖擻、鬥志高昂，相信你們抵達德國後，必定會迅速適應當地的時差、氣候和環境，以最佳狀態迎戰各地好手，力爭超越上屆四金、一銀、七銅的成績。

憑藉「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，在這次大學生運動會中，香港運動員能夠以「中國香港」的名義征戰國際體育賽場，實在意義非凡。希望你們珍惜和把握國家為我們提供的寶貴機會，展現精湛的技術和永不言敗的精神，將我們的香港獅子山下精神發揮到極致，為香港和祖國爭光。

特區政府在今年三月完成精英體育資助制度的檢討，並公布由四月起上調每月資助金額，減輕精英運動員的經濟壓力，讓他們更專注於訓練，向體壇高峰邁進。未來，政府會持續為本地運動員創造更優越的條件，助力他們在地區及國際賽場上發光發亮。

在此，我衷心感謝中國香港大專體育協會、各所大專院校、香港體育學院，以及教練、醫療團隊和後勤人員的悉心努力。你們的悉心栽培和鼎力支援，讓本地體壇得以新秀輩出，為長遠發展奠下良好根基。當然，我們也要多謝香港賽馬會對於體育事業的鼎力支持，希望他們會再接再勵，令運動員有更好的發揮。

今日授予代表團的旗幟，不僅是國家地區的象徵，更承載着全港市民的期許。希望各位運動員發揮出色，旗開得勝，滿載而歸！多謝各位。"
《2025年立法會（權力及特權）（修訂）條例草案》刊憲,2025-07-08 16:15,2025-07-08 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800369.htm,"​政府今日（七月八日）在憲報刊登《2025年立法會（權力及特權）（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

因應立法會完善立法會議員履職制度、引入《立法會議員守則》（《守則》）和對《議事規則》作出相應修訂，政府將按立法會建議提交《條例草案》，以修訂《立法會（權力及特權）條例》（第382章）（《條例》），向因違反《守則》而根據《議事規則》被暫停立法會職務的立法會議員施加財政處分。

政府發言人說︰「政府支持立法會完善議員履職制度的建議。現時《條例》有關立法會議員在停職期間須扣起其酬金及津貼的規定，只適用於因議員作出極不檢點行為的情況。根據立法會建議，議員日後因違反《守則》並根據《議事規則》被暫停立法會職務，其停職期間的酬金及津貼同樣須被扣起。修訂亦為立法會提供彈性，以處理立法會將來因根據《議事規則》所批准的其他理由被暫停立法會職務的議員須扣起酬金及津貼的情況。《條例草案》如獲立法會通過，會與《守則》和經修訂的《議事規則》一併於第八屆立法會起生效。」

「政府充分肯定立法會就加強自我監督和自我完善，並增加立法會運作的透明度而採取的措施。《條例》的修訂有助立法會不斷求進，為『愛國者治港』創造更大價值。」

《條例草案》將於明日（七月九日）提交立法會作首讀。"

In light of the Legislative Council (LegCo)'s improvement to the system on the performance of duties by LegCo Members, the introduction of the Code for Members of the Legislative Council, and corresponding amendments to be made to the Rules of Procedure (RoP), in accordance with the LegCo's proposal, the Government will introduce the Bill, which aims to amend the Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance (Cap. 382) to provide for imposing financial penalties on LegCo Members suspended under the RoP from the service of the LegCo due to a breach of the Code.

""The Government supports the LegCo's proposal on improving the system on the performance of duties by Members. At present, the deprivation of LegCo Members' remuneration and allowance in respect of the period of suspension provided under the Ordinance is only applicable to cases of engaging in grossly disorderly conduct. According to the LegCo's proposal, in future, Members who have breached the Code and are suspended under the RoP will also be subject to the same deprivation of remuneration and allowance. The amendments will also provide flexibility to the LegCo to cater for deprivation of remuneration and allowance of Members suspended from the service of the LegCo for other reasons under the RoP as approved by the LegCo in future. Once the Bill is passed by the LegCo, it will take effect starting from the Eighth-Term LegCo in tandem with the Code and the amended RoP.

  ""The Government fully appreciates the initiatives taken by the LegCo to enhance self-regulation and self-improvement as well as transparency of the LegCo's operation. The amendments to the Ordinance will facilitate the LegCo in striving for continual improvement, thereby optimising the contribution of 'patriots administering Hong Kong',"" a Government spokesman said.

The Bill will be introduced into the LegCo for first reading tomorrow (July 9)."

海關透過情報分析及風險評估，在六月二十七日抽查一艘由香港出發前往澳門的內河船。經查驗後，海關在該艘船上檢獲大批懷疑走私貨物，包括約五十七萬件懷疑藥劑製品、約一千五百公斤乾魚翅、約四十七公斤水煙膏、約四十二公斤燕窩、約三十八公斤雪茄，以及一千三百八十部手提電話。

案件仍在調查中，不排除會有人被捕。

海關是專責打擊走私的政府部門，一直全方位積極打擊各類走私活動。海關的執法行動絕不鬆懈，將繼續嚴厲打擊海上走私活動，積極運用風險管理及情報主導執法策略，適時開展針對性的反走私行動，全力遏止相關活動。

走私屬嚴重罪行，根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case by river trade vessel involving goods worth about $34 million (with photo),2025-07-08 16:05,2025-07-08 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800632.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on June 27 detected a suspected smuggling case involving a river trade vessel. A large batch of suspected smuggled goods with a total estimated market value of about $34 million was seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, a river trade vessel departing from Hong Kong for Macao was selected for inspection on June 27. Upon examination, Customs officers onboard the vessel found a large batch of suspected smuggled goods, including about 570 000 suspected pharmaceutical products, about 1 500 kilograms of dried shark fins, about 47kg of shisha tobacco, about 42kg of bird's nests, about 38kg of cigars and 1 380 mobile phones.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Being a government department primarily responsible for tackling smuggling activities, Customs has long been combating various smuggling activities on all fronts. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on relevant activities.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

尊敬的李永勝副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、蔡冠深主席（國際品牌科學院董事會主席、粵港澳大灣區企業家聯盟主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興今天與各位聚首一堂，共同見證香港首屆世界品牌大會開幕，同時慶祝國際品牌科學院正式落戶香港。

習近平主席強調國家必須因地制宜發展新質生產力，多次對品牌建設作出重要指示，包括要推動：「中國製造」向「中國創造」轉變、「中國速度」向「中國質量」轉變、「中國產品」向「中國品牌」轉變，打造更多叫得響的中國品牌。

品牌超越商業機構的商標符號，更是承載意念的文化圖騰。當前，保護主義破壞環球經貿秩序，世界正重新構建經濟新格局。國家企業和機構推出國際知名的品牌，可以展現中國企業的創新能力和市場優勢，更能讓世界了解國家發展新質生產力的堅定決心和雄厚實力。

國家「十四五」規劃提出要開展中國品牌創建行動，保護發展中華老字號，提升自主品牌影響力和競爭力，並率先在消費品領域培育一批高端品牌。

今年是「十四五」規劃收官之年。幾年以來，國家在服裝、家庭用品、運動用品等傳統產業推陳出新，在創科領域發展更是一日千里，在通訊設備、新能源汽車，以至無人機等表現都讓世界矚目，成功打造出一個又一個國際知名品牌，很多更處於全球市場的領導地位。

這些響噹噹的中國品牌說明，成功建立自家品牌，一方面能為企業增值和提高利潤，推動國家經濟持續發展，同時更可以提升全社會的創新文化，鼓勵產業通過發展品牌，推出更有特色的產品，提升競爭力。

香港中西文化薈萃，除了擁有很多自身發展的國際知名品牌，更一直都是全球品牌匯聚的重要平台。多年以來，很多內地新興消費品牌，包括特色餐飲、影視娛樂、專業服務，以至新能源產業，都首選香港作為企業「出海」的第一站。

香港在「一國兩制」下擁有「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，我們與內地山水相連、同根同源，更具備源遠流長的法治傳統、國際接軌的監管制度、自由方便的經濟環境、高效專業的金融服務、多元包容的文化氛圍，聚集環球頂級機構和中外旅客，可以發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，服務更多內地品牌走向全球，為品牌強國建設作出貢獻。

特區政府積極維護香港健全有效的保護知識產權制度，保障專利、版權及商標等，打造香港成為區域知識產權貿易中心，為內地和海外的品牌交易提供更好的監管環境。

同時，特區政府全力支援香港企業開發自家品牌、擴大業務範圍。其中，我們通過「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」資助企業品牌擁抱創新，開展更廣闊市場。香港貿易發展局舉辦的「香港好物節」和不同展覽推廣活動，在線上線下全方位推介香港優質的商品和服務。

過往，品牌是口碑；今天，品牌是體驗；明天，品牌將是創新與科技的結合。我感謝主辦機構對推動品牌發展的不懈努力，特區政府會與各位繼續攜手合作，通過品牌建設說好中國故事，說好香港故事。

最後，我祝願今天的大會圓滿成功，各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

這些響噹噹的中國品牌說明，成功建立自家品牌，一方面能為企業增值和提高利潤，推動國家經濟持續發展，同時更可以提升全社會的創新文化，鼓勵產業通過發展品牌，推出更有特色的產品，提升競爭力。

香港中西文化薈萃，除了擁有很多自身發展的國際知名品牌，更一直都是全球品牌匯聚的重要平台。多年以來，很多內地新興消費品牌，包括特色餐飲、影視娛樂、專業服務，以至新能源產業，都首選香港作為企業「出海」的第一站。

香港在「一國兩制」下擁有「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，我們與內地山水相連、同根同源，更具備源遠流長的法治傳統、國際接軌的監管制度、自由方便的經濟環境、高效專業的金融服務、多元包容的文化氛圍，聚集環球頂級機構和中外旅客，可以發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，服務更多內地品牌走向全球，為品牌強國建設作出貢獻。

特區政府積極維護香港健全有效的保護知識產權制度，保障專利、版權及商標等，打造香港成為區域知識產權貿易中心，為內地和海外的品牌交易提供更好的監管環境。

同時，特區政府全力支援香港企業開發自家品牌、擴大業務範圍。其中，我們通過「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」資助企業品牌擁抱創新，開展更廣闊市場。香港貿易發展局舉辦的「香港好物節」和不同展覽推廣活動，在線上線下全方位推介香港優質的商品和服務。

過往，品牌是口碑；今天，品牌是體驗；明天，品牌將是創新與科技的結合。我感謝主辦機構對推動品牌發展的不懈努力，特區政府會與各位繼續攜手合作，通過品牌建設說好中國故事，說好香港故事。

最後，我祝願今天的大會圓滿成功，各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

多謝主席、各位委員。

發展都市農業是《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》的其中一個策略。都市農場一般會採用較先進的設施進行「多層耕作」，生產優質、新鮮和減少碳足跡的農產品；同時藉着在農場內舉行的教育活動為市民提供耕作體驗，讓農業與城市化發展並存。

政府正多管齊下協助業界發展都市農業。在規劃方面，我們會把握北部都會區和其他新發展區的發展機遇，在規劃階段加入都市農業元素，並善用合適的都市空間和政府建築物天台作都市農業用途。去年，政府已獲城市規劃委員會同意，修訂「休憩用地」的法定圖則詞彙釋義，以涵蓋「都市農場」用途。漁護署（漁農自然護理署）亦正積極探討將都市農業設定為綠色建築的指標之一，以鼓勵具商業元素的私人發展項目加入都市農業。

在物色合適的政府場地設立都市農場方面，我們已在馬鞍山西沙路花園撥出用地設立首個都市農場試驗項目。我們亦會在合適的公眾街市設置現代化水耕農場暨攤檔，推廣「現耕現賣」的概念。

接下來，我請漁護署助理署長馬惠忠用投影片介紹討論文件。多謝各位。"

​申訴專員向立法會議員報告二○二四／二五年度工作成果（附圖）,2025-07-08 14:16,2025-07-08 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800346.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出︰

申訴專員陳積志今日（七月八日）出席與立法會議員舉行的年度會議，簡介二○二四／二五年度申訴專員公署的工作進展和成果，未來公署會積極推動公共行政變革，聚焦簡化流程、提升效率，從而進一步改善公共行政。陳積志在會上亦與立法會議員就共同關注的課題交換意見，進行建設性交流。

在會議上，陳積志提到公署呼應國家對香港特別行政區（特區）的期盼：勇於改革、敢於破局、不斷創新，公署在二○二四／二五年度訂下三個策略性方向，在多方面的工作取得滿意成果。陳積志說︰「在調解方面，公署取得史無前例的佳績。在二○二四／二五年度，公署成功調解了555宗不涉行政失當或只涉及輕微行政失當的個案，刷新了記錄。」公署按「民有所呼，我有所應」的原則，以調解形式迅速及圓滿解決申訴人的困擾，部門亦可檢視內部程序及作出改善，提升公共行政水平。公署的調解工作更獲得申訴人及部門的高度評價，成效令人鼓舞。

公署同樣關注跨部門協作。陳積志在會議上闡釋公署分析過往處理的跨部門協作個案，發現成效主要有四個方面，包括釐清權責、找出問題的癥結、促成部門直接溝通和分享經驗，以及採取聯合行動。公署在社交媒體及網站推出全新的「好人好事」系列，精選調解及跨部門協作個案，撰寫與市民切身相關的故事，讓市民了解向公署申訴的成果。

公署於二○二四／二五年度全力宣揚「正面看申訴」的理念，並積極透過交流、宣傳教育及嘉許計劃，鼓勵市民以建設性態度參與公共事務和提出意見，同時亦倡導部門及機構持開明、開放的態度服務市民。陳積志深信以正面態度提出建議，有助推動良政善治。

陳積志在會議上重點分享了幾個主動調查行動的例子，包括廣受政府、業界和社會重視的建造業職業安全及健康的監管、打擊濫用公屋資源及收回、翻新及重新編配公屋單位，以及引起市民共鳴的辦理先人過世手續相關的公共服務。就主動調查行動報告，公署在二○二四／二五年度向政府部門或機構提出148項改善建議，連同106項由全面調查報告提出的建議，公署合共提出254項建議，數目較二○二三／二四年度的建議總數大幅增加了37%，更是近五年的新高。

公署在七月重整組織架構，包括將首長級職位編制由三層架構精簡為兩層，凍結副申訴專員的空缺，改由三名助理申訴專員分掌三大部門——申訴調查部、主動調查部，以及申訴評審及支援部，直接向申訴專員匯報；主動調查隊的編制亦由兩隊增加至三隊，並增添了申訴評審工作的人手，精簡申訴調查隊和行政及支援人員的編制，更靈活調配資源。陳積志說︰「公署會繼續透過培訓及內部晉升，建立一支富經驗、有能力、愛國愛港的調查及支援團隊。」

另外，陳積志亦匯報了公署在國際層面的工作概況，包括去年十二月籌辦的國際申訴專員高峰論壇2024，以及公署成立35周年的慶祝大會。活動獲中央政府、特區政府及國際同儕充分肯定及高度讚賞，並獲傳媒廣泛報道。高峰論壇共有約140位來自六大洲約40個國家及地區的內地及海外參加者。公署亦與來自五大洲八個國家及地區的代表，簽署雙邊合作諒解備忘錄，彰顯香港作為「超級聯繫人」的重要地位。

公署積極參與國際事務，陳積志除擔任亞洲申訴專員協會秘書長，亦在今年初分別成為國際申訴專員協會轄下章程常務委員會主席及聯合國及國際合作工作小組的委員，以及在五月獲選為國際申訴專員協會澳太區分會的常任理事。陳積志表示，公署將繼續參與國際合作平台，在世界舞台上說好香港在｢一國兩制｣下「由治及興」的好故事，達致背靠祖國，聯通世界的目標。同時，亦會與內地的相關機構保持緊密聯繫。

展望未來，公署會按《申訴專員條例》把好關，集中資源處理需要協助的申訴；繼續着力推行調解為市民解困；加強主動調查行動，提出務實有效的建議和觀點，聚焦簡化流程、提升效率，從而改善公共行政。陳積志亦提到公署設立香港國際申訴專員學院的籌備工作如火如荼，學院已落實在今年八月二十五日舉辦第一場調解分享會。陳積志深信「預防勝於治療」，學院往後會着力向公職人員灌輸「防範行政失當」的概念，以提高他們的警覺性，避免行政失當。這亦標誌着公署在推動公共行政積極變革方面的一個新的里程碑。"
Ombudsman briefs Legislative Council Members on work results in 2024-25 (with photo),2025-07-08 14:16,2025-07-08 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800344.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (July 8) attended an annual meeting with the Legislative Council (LegCo) and briefed members on the progress and results of the Office of The Ombudsman's work in 2024-25. Looking forward, the Office will drive positive change in public administration, especially by streamlining workflow and enhancing efficiency to bring about further improvement in public administration. Mr Chan also exchanged constructive views with LegCo Members on matters of mutual concern.

At the meeting, Mr Chan mentioned that in response to the motherland's expectations of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Office will stay bold in reform, dare to break new ground, and innovate continuously. In the reporting year, the Office championed three strategic focuses and achieved satisfactory results in various areas. Mr Chan said, ""On the front of mediation, the Office achieved unprecedented results during the reporting year, concluding an all-time high of 555 cases involving no or only minor maladministration."" Based on the motto of ""responding to people's needs"", the Office helped the complainants out of their predicament speedily and amicably through mediation, while the departments could also review internal procedures and make improvements, thereby enhancing the standards of public administration. The results were encouraging as the Office's mediation work was highly commended by both complainants and departments.

Interdepartmental collaboration is another strategic focus of the Office. At the meeting, Mr Chan elaborated that after analysing the interdepartmental collaboration cases handled over the past, positive impact was observed in four major areas: clarifying the demarcation of responsibilities, grasping the crux of the matter, facilitating direct communication and experience sharing among departments, and launching joint operations. The Office has introduced a new series featuring stories of good people and good deeds on social media and its website, showcasing mediation and interdepartmental collaboration closely related to people's livelihood and highlighting the results brought about by complaint handling.

During the reporting year, the Office spared no effort in advocating a positive complaint culture through exchange meetings, publicity campaigns, education initiatives and commendation schemes. Not only are the public encouraged to participate in social issues and voice their opinions in a constructive manner, but departments and organisations are also urged to serve the public with open-mindedness. Mr Chan firmly believes that fostering constructive suggestions and positive feedback is conducive to the promotion of good governance.

Mr Chan highlighted at the meeting several direct investigation (DI) operations widely concerned by the Government, professions and the community, including regulation of occupational safety and health in construction industry, combating abuse of public housing resources, and the arrangements for recovery, refurbishment and reallocation of public housing rental flats. A poignant DI operation was conducted into the provision of public services relating to after-death arrangements. During the reporting year, the Office made 148 recommendations to government departments or public organisations in DI operation reports. Together with the 106 recommendations made in full investigation reports, the total number of 254 recommendations soared by 37 per cent over that in 2023-24 and hit a record high in the recent five years.

The Office completed a reorganisation in July, under which it has streamlined the directorate establishment from a three-tier to a two-tier directorate structure by freezing the vacancy of Deputy Ombudsman. Instead, three Assistant Ombudsmen, all reporting directly to the Ombudsman, are appointed to head three major divisions, namely the Complaints Investigation Division, the Direct Investigation Division, and the Complaints Assessment and Support Division. The Office has deployed resources more flexibly to increase the number of Direct Investigation Teams from two to three, augment the staffing for complaints assessment, and streamline the complement of Complaints Investigation Teams and administrative and support staff. Mr Chan said, ""The Office will adhere to the strategy of training and internal promotion to cultivate a contingent of experienced and competent investigation officers and support staff that are dedicated to our country and Hong Kong.""

Separately, Mr Chan reported the Office's international liaison work, including hosting the International Ombudsman Summit 2024 and The Ombudsman's 35th Anniversary Reception Ceremony in December last year. The event was supported and commended by the Central Government, the HKSAR Government and international counterparts, and widely reported by the media. Around 140 Mainland and overseas participants from about 40 countries and regions across six continents attended the Summit. The Office also signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Bilateral Cooperation with representatives from eight countries and regions across five continents, demonstrating Hong Kong's important role as a ""super connector"".

The Office actively participated in international affairs. In addition to being the Secretary of the Asian Ombudsman Association, Mr Chan was appointed earlier this year as the Chairman of the Standing By-laws Committee and a member of the United Nations and International Cooperation Working Group under the International Ombudsman Institute (IOI) respectively. In May, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Australasian and Pacific Region of the IOI. Mr Chan pledged to continue playing an active role on international co-operation platforms, presenting to global audiences a good story about Hong Kong from stability to prosperity under ""one country, two systems"", and leveraging the unique position of having strong support from the motherland and close connections to the world. Furthermore, the Office will maintain a close relationship with its Mainland counterparts.

Looking forward, the Office will perform the gatekeeping function under The Ombudsman Ordinance to focus resources on those complaints that require assistance. It will press ahead with promoting mediation to redress public grievances, step up DI operations and make pragmatic and effective recommendations and observations, especially on streamlining workflow and enhancing efficiency to bring about improvement in public administration. Mr Chan also remarked that the preparations for establishing the Hong Kong International Ombudsman Academy are in full swing. The Academy's first exchange session on mediation is scheduled for August 25, 2025. In line with Mr Chan's firm belief in ""prevention is better than cure"", the Academy will endeavour to instil the concept of ""maladministration prevention"" in public officers to enhance their vigilance and take precautions against maladministration. This also marks a new milestone of the Office in driving positive change in public administration."

Speech by CE at South China Morning Post China Conference 2025 (English only) (with photos/video),2025-07-08 11:55,2025-07-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800364.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the South China Morning Post China Conference 2025 today (July 8):

Ms Catherine So (Chief Executive Officer of the South China Morning Post), Ms Tammy Tam (Editor-in-Chief of the South China Morning Post), Mr Steve Finch (President and Chief Executive Officer of Manulife Asia), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It's a pleasure to join you here, once again, at the South China Morning Post's annual China Conference - the 11th edition.

More than 700 of you are here for this year's gathering. Some 300s are joining us, virtually, at this forum for business, trade, finance, investment and technology. All of you keen on getting the latest intelligence and insights, developments and business opportunities - in Hong Kong, throughout China and beyond.

The theme of this China Conference is ""Where Capital Meets Innovation"" - an apt description of the strengths of China, our country, and how Hong Kong contributes to its rise. That provides the world with much-needed certainty, especially in this difficult time.

This year's international trade uncertainties, and chaos, may well continue amidst the rise of protectionism and unilateralism. The global economy is grappling with profound instability, escalating geopolitical risks and the wholesale reshaping of long-existing trading systems.

In spite of a damaged global trade order, the expanding trade and capital flows of China, our country, help buoy the economy of the region and the world.

The Mainland economy has sound fundamentals, a vast domestic market and the robust policies in place to withstand external challenges. In the first quarter of this year, the country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) grew by 5.4 per cent, and key economic indicators have kept improving since the beginning of the second quarter - simply said, China, our country, is well on its way to achieving the official growth target of around 5 per cent for 2025.

As for Hong Kong, our economy expanded solidly by 3.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2025, supported by visible increases in exports and the resumption of moderate growth in overall investment expenditure. We forecast real GDP growth of 2 per cent to 3 per cent in this year.

Last week, we celebrated the 28th anniversary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's establishment. That happy occasion was a welcome opportunity to thank our country for championing Hong Kong through the ""one country, two systems"" principle, as well as the national strategies and made-for-Hong Kong initiatives it supports us with.

Last month, the World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Hong Kong third in the world in global competitiveness, up two places from the previous year, and up four places from 2023.

It marks Hong Kong's return to the global top three for the first time since 2019, reflecting our commitment to change in face of today's rising challenges.

There's a lot more to be grateful for. In April and May, Hong Kong's merchandise exports showed double-digit, year-on-year growth, while visitor arrivals also brought double-digit, year-on-year increases in the second quarter.

And Hong Kong, in the first half of this year, has been the world's largest IPO (initial public offering) fundraising market, raising over US$13 billion. That's up a whopping 22 per cent, compared with the full-year figure last year.

It speaks of Hong Kong's long-standing appeal as a safe haven for Chinese and international capital and a bridge for global investors.

Hong Kong is, after all, the most internationalised city in the country. We offer the world a market-friendly business environment underpinned by the rule of law. We are the only common law jurisdiction in our country, with a legal system and regulatory regime similar to most global financial hubs. And we present business and investment advantages unmatched by any other city in the world.

Last year, the total number of local registered companies reached its record high, surpassing 1.46 million. And the total number of non-local companies registered here also reached a record high, and was over 15 000. Both figures continue to show encouraging growth this year.

Since January 2023, Invest Hong Kong, our dedicated investment promotion agency, has assisted more than 1 300 Mainland and overseas companies in setting up or expanding their business in Hong Kong. These companies bring in foreign direct investment of over US$21 billion to our economy, creating over 19 000 jobs.

When I assumed office as Chief Executive three years ago, I established the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises. My aim is to offer, through this Office, one-stop facilitation services and tailor-made incentives to attract strategic enterprises to our city and foster innovation and economic growth.

The Office has brought in 84 strategic companies, from such high-tech industries as advanced manufacturing and new energy technology, AI and data science, fintech and life and health technology. The strategic companies will invest about US$6.4 billion in the next few years, creating over 20 000 jobs.

We also launched a new scheme in May this year to create a company re-domiciliation regime to attract companies to Hong Kong. It provides a convenient, safe and secure pathway for companies to re-domicile to Hong Kong. Different companies have already expressed their interest to the regime and two international insurance giants - as Mr Finch is surely aware - have announced they will officially re-domicile to Hong Kong. Good business always makes right decisions.

These companies all gave their strong vote of confidence in the development of Hong Kong and the country, and will help attract a wealth of partners and related companies to this part of the globe.

Another strong advantage Hong Kong offers to overseas companies here, old or new, is our easy access to the Mainland market. We are certainly a front runner in this regard.

That's in no small part thanks to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA, our de facto free trade agreement with the Mainland that provides preferential treatment to Hong Kong companies, facilitating smoother access to the Mainland's vast market.

A new amendment agreement under the CEPA Agreement on Trade in Services entered into force this March. It includes the removal of the qualifying period requirement on Hong Kong service suppliers in most sectors, meaning our many new companies can also benefit from the arrangement's facilitation measures in accessing the Mainland market.

Together with new initiatives that allow Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law and choose Hong Kong as the seat for arbitration in their operation in a range of Mainland cities, CEPA provides a wide range of innovative enhancements that help a world of investors better capitalise on China's growth opportunities, with the help of Hong Kong's world-class professional services.

Then there's technological innovation, including artificial intelligence. AI advancements are transforming production, business and consumption patterns. They are redefining the core competitiveness of economies.

These trends create new opportunities for Hong Kong, particularly in our deepening integration with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a cluster city development that brings together Hong Kong, Macao, and nine southern cities on the Mainland.

With a population exceeding 87 million and a GDP of more than US$2 trillion last year, similar to the size of the 10th largest economy in the world, the Greater Bay Area is among the most open and economically vibrant regions in the country.

The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster, which includes three of the Greater Bay Area's core cities, has been ranked second, globally, for five consecutive years in the Global Innovation Index, published by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

Drawing together Hong Kong's research capabilities and business competitiveness, as well as the Mainland's innovation and advanced manufacturing prowess, the Greater Bay Area endeavours to become a world-leading I&T (innovation and technology) hub.

One spectacular example is the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, an area that straddles our boundary with Shenzhen. It will develop into a cutting-edge advanced technology centre that converges the strengths of Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Last November, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government published the Development Outline for the Hong Kong Park in the co-operation zone.

The Park's first three buildings have been completed, and the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute opened last November at Hong Kong Park.

That’s just the beginning. Artificial intelligence, new energy vehicles, the low-altitude economy, fintech, and more, are thriving in the Greater Bay Area. And as the Park enters into the operational phase this year, more of these companies will be joining us.

Beyond I&T, we have seen the successful introduction of a wide variety of policy initiatives with the Greater Bay Area, including measures for the two-way flow of talent, schemes for supporting youth innovation, entrepreneurship and employment, and policies to facilitate mutual travel.

And the promise of further co-operation between Hong Kong and the rest of the Greater Bay Area and the Mainland is boundless.

Ladies and gentlemen, when we talk of China's might, many of us immediately look to the maiden visit to Hong Kong over the past weekend of the first domestically built aircraft carrier of China, our country, the Shandong. Although the fleet has just bid us farewell yesterday, the awe and pride it drew among the people of Hong Kong over its five-day visit will be long-lasting.

More than a display of maritime strength, the fleet showcases our country's commitment to peacekeeping and regional stability. And much like how the Shandong docked in our safe harbour, Hong Kong is where the country anchors its trust.

In this era of fogged horizons, China does not just project power - it radiates investible stability. And Hong Kong is the ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" that links the world with opportunities from China's growth and certainties. A link you can always bank on.

Amid an ever changing geopolitical landscape and constantly escalating uncertainties, Hong Kong is the place that promises security and development. This certainty of security and development is precisely what a world of investors need and thirst for.

Together, we will fully seize development opportunities, keep boosting our competitiveness, undertake reforms for progress, and foster innovation. The wisdom and wealth of experience of the people of Hong Kong will help the Pearl of the Orient shine brighter than ever on the world stage.

My thanks to the South China Morning Post for organising this essential, always eventful, annual gathering.

I wish you all a rewarding conference. And the best of business in the second half of 2025, a year that will surely be full of opportunities and rewards. Thank you."

"Speech by SJ at business seminar and dinner in Amsterdam, Netherlands (English only) (with photo)",2025-07-08 10:06,2025-07-08 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800226.htm,"  Following are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at a business seminar and dinner organised by the Netherlands Hong Kong Business Association with the support of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Brussels and Invest Hong Kong on July 7 (Amsterdam time):

His Excellency Mr Tan Jian (Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Kingdom of the Netherlands), dear friends from the Association, and distinguished guests in the Netherlands,

Firstly, I'm really delighted and honoured to be given the chance to speak to these distinguished audience this evening. Perhaps I should begin by telling you a little bit more about myself and the purpose of my present trip. I have used to practice in Hong Kong as a civil and commercial barrister. I've been practicing in Hong Kong for almost 30 years and then joined the Government about three years ago. So that's when I became the Secretary for Justice.

I had considered to come to the Netherlands and this part of the world for a very long time. Unfortunately, for many reasons I was unable to do this until this occasion. So this is in fact my first trip to Europe after I took my office. So I've chosen the Netherlands.

For personal reasons, I love travelling in the past. I travelled quite a lot. Amsterdam is very top on my list, I always come to Amsterdam to stay a couple of days, go to museums, restaurants, just to walk around, and then I move on as a stopover, and move on to other destinations. But Amsterdam is always a stop that I could not miss, so I have very good personal reasons to come to Amsterdam once again.

For official reasons, the Netherlands is the second-largest trading partner of Hong Kong within Europe. There are more than 170 companies in Hong Kong. And I was invited to join the National Day Reception in late April. So, I have too many reasons to choose the Netherlands as my best destination.

Returning to today's seminar, I understand that you have heard from many eminent speakers this afternoon who have shared with you many important information about the latest development in Hong Kong in different areas. I know that you are all very keen supporters of Hong Kong and there must be reasons why you were attracted to Hong Kong. Maybe the probable reason is that you see Hong Kong as a very open society. We offer a very fair, transparent, predictable environment for you to explore business opportunities, either in Hong Kong, in China, or the Asia Pacific region. But I think all these characteristics are highly concerned with the political and legal landscape of Hong Kong. This is an important point in the sense that we are living at a rather difficult time. And Hong Kong has faced a lot of challenges in recent years. You are all keen supporters of Hong Kong. But outside this room, I'm clearly aware of the fact that many people do have a lot of questions about the future of Hong Kong. They may not be as confident as you of the future of Hong Kong. There are a lot of misgivings, misunderstandings, so on and so forth. I do believe that it's my duty, not simply as a government official, but as a Hong Kong citizen, to bite the bullet, to face the music, to try to convince people why Hong Kong is still the Hong Kong that you are familiar with, why Hong Kong is still the Hong Kong that we all love.

There's one single message that I wish to convey, and that is ""Hong Kong is still Hong Kong"". I wish to perhaps look at the latest development or something that I regard to be of great importance insofar as political landscape and legal landscape are concerned. Let me begin by the political landscapes of Hong Kong. I make it all boiled down to one very important thing. The gist of the matter is the principle of ""one country, two system"". It's because of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong enjoys a number of very unique strengths and characteristics which are unparalleled. For example, we have our own independent legal system based on common law, our own independent financial system, our own currency, free flow of capital, we have trade port, we have no tariffs, no trade barriers, but all these things are because of the fact that we have ""one country, two systems"".

So the elephant in the room is this, is the principle of ""one country, two systems"" to be maintained, or is it going to be changed in whatever way in future? I wish to give you three reasons, why there shouldn't be any worry or concern that the principle of ""one country, two systems"" will be altered or changed in future. The first reason is that the principle of ""one country, two systems"", notwithstanding the fact that it's a political concept, but actually it's constitutional entrenched in the sense that its implementation is guaranteed by a constitutional document which is the Basic Law. I'm sure that many people in this room is familiar with the Basic Law. But what I wish to highlight is that on July 1, we celebrated the 28th anniversary of China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong. And for 28 years, and notwithstanding the fact that we had encountered a number of difficulties and challenges, not a single word, not a single clause in our Basic Law had been changed.

Secondly, which is a matter of law, I think lawyers would be interested in what I am saying. In the Basic Law, there's a provision which allows amendment to be made to the Basic Law, subject to a very important qualification. There's a very clear, expressed provision, that any amendment cannot contravene, or cannot change the basic policy of the People's Republic of China regarding Hong Kong, and that basic policy is precisely ""one country, two systems"". So legally speaking, as a matter of constitutional, our constitutional order, you cannot really change the fundamental principle of ""one country, two systems"". So if you feel that I'm not too legalistic, I move on to my second point, my second reason.

The second reason is highly political, but it's of crucial importance in the present context. That goes to the reassurances given by the top state leaders of the People's Republic of China. I would mention three very important speeches, two made by President Xi Jinping. And the last speech was given by Wang Yi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. First, President Xi Jinping said on July 1, 2022, it was the 25th anniversary of China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong. It was when I assumed my current position as the Secretary for Justice. In his very important speech, he made a very important point. He said that the principal of ""one country, two systems"" is a good policy that must be adhered to in the long run. I think he was trying to convey a very important message, to dispel any misgivings, any doubts that Beijing had any intention whatsoever to change its basic policy towards Hong Kong. The ""one country, two systems"" principle also applies to Macau. So more recently, on December 20, 2024, also at the 25th anniversary of China's resumption of sovereignty over Macau, President Xi Jinping made another very important speech, repeating why the principle of ""one country, two systems"" is a good system. At the end, he said that the principle of ""one country, two systems"" actually embodies very important universal values - peace, openness, inclusiveness, and sharing. And he said that these values are valuable, important, not just to China, Macau, or even China as a whole, but to the whole world. So the China's national strategy is to make use of this principle of ""one country, two systems"" to assist its modernisation. So as a matter of logic and common sense, it's unthinkable that either HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) or Beijing would shoot ourselves in the foot by damaging or destroying the most valuable asset which makes Hong Kong being in a position to contribute to the success or even survival of Hong Kong.

The last speech was given by Mr Wang Yi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, when he attended the signing ceremony of a very important international convention. It's known as the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation. It is an international treaty signed by 33 countries, including China. And most of these countries include countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and even one in Europe, Serbia. The Swiss foreign minister came to Hong Kong to give a speech. The purpose of the convention is to set up the first inter-governmental international organisation, which is devoted to use mediation as a means to resolve different types of international disputes, including disputes between sovereign states, disputes between states and foreign nationals, say, for example, investor-state disputes, and even international civil and commercial disputes. The important thing is that the state parties, in particular China, supported that the headquarters of this new organisation will be situated in Hong Kong. The question is why. Just imagine for Beijing or even other countries, they have a lot of options. Why not in Beijing, why not in Shanghai, why not in Shenzhen or anywhere? But Hong Kong, why Hong Kong? I think Mr Wang Yi gave the answer in his important speech. He mentioned once again it's because of ""one country, two systems"". Because under ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong inherits the common law tradition, but at the same time, the Mainland China practises a civil law system. There's a synergy between the systems. So we are the best of both worlds, so to speak. And that's precisely the reason why such an important international organisation, the headquarters of such an organisation will be situated in Hong Kong. This is a very important message. It is a very strong vote of confidence and given by not just China, but other state parties in the future of Hong Kong. So that's my second reason.

The third reason concerns a piece of law passed last year in Hong Kong. For people familiar with Hong Kong, you would be aware that all lands in Hong Kong are held pursuant to government leases, except for St. John's Cathedral. For people who have been to Hong Kong, you know that St. John's Cathedral is a freehold land for historical reasons. But otherwise, all lands in Hong Kong that were held pursuant to government leases, which means that they were for a fixed time, very often for 99 years. And the reality is that many of these government leases, hundreds and thousands, will expire by 2047. That is 50 years after China’s resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong. So last year, we passed a legislation, the effect of which is that all these leases, which are going to expire before, or by 2047 will be automatically renewed for 50 years, without any additional premium. That means that these land ownership will be guaranteed, they will continue, they will go beyond 2047. Of course, land ownership is extremely important. It is not simply concerned with the provision of shelter or home for people. It serves as very important security, a very valuable asset for business people, for financial institution. So that's the way we assure people that our system will not change because I cannot find a more important example showing the distinguished feature of ""one country, two systems"" by referring to our land ownership system. So I think this is a very compelling piece of evidence. I have three pieces of evidence to convince people that any misgiving would be misplaced. So this is about the political landscape.

What about the legal landscape? I mentioned a moment ago that one of the essential characteristics of ""one country, two systems"" is the fact that we are still using the common law system. I wish to highlight three very important features of our common law system that will be maintained, enhanced, and of great importance in ensuring Hong Kong's continued success in the future.

Firstly, the credibility of our common law system. Our people are willing to come to Hong Kong because they believe in Hong Kong's legal system. And one of the key reasons is that in Hong Kong we have a very reputable and credible independent judiciary. Judicial independence is a very key element of a legal system. How do we show to people that Hong Kong's judicial system, Hong Kong's judiciary, will remain independent? The answer is that we are a very open system. We have invited many eminent foreign judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit in our court. I wish to give two very concrete examples. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong enjoys the power of final adjudication, because before 1997, all the final appeal cases would have to be heard in Privy Council in London. But after 1997, we enjoy the final power of adjudication. So the highest court will be the Court of Final Appeal and that's a very special arrangement, which I'm sure that some of you would be aware of. We are at liberty, we are permitted to invite judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit as foreign non-permanent judges. At the moment, and I would say that even after 2019 and 2020 when Hong Kong experienced some challenges, even after 2020, or since 2020, we have three foreign judges agreeing to come to Hong Kong. So for the time being, there are altogether six foreign non-permanent judges. Two from England, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Neuberger. For lawyers, they would be very familiar names. And then three judges from Australia, and one from New Zealand. The most recent appointment was Sir William Young, a former judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand. He was appointed in June, so less than a month ago. So why would these eminent judges agree to come to Hong Kong if they are not confident and do not believe in Hong Kong itself? The other thing is that even at the Court of First Instance level, the judiciary has been inviting judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit as part-time judges. And I can also give a very recent example. I know that very soon, a judge who is a British, a very eminent British lawyer, will come to Hong Kong to sit in commercial cases. So these are the continuous efforts made by Hong Kong to ensure that we will retain the international characteristic to give people confidence.

And of course, I have to mention, it's something that I hesitate to mention, that the Government still loses cases from time to time, but it's the most compelling evidence to prove the existence of judicial independence. Of course I would not say that I was very happy with the outcome, but I described it as a very healthy phenomenon. It's very cogent and conclusive proof of the fact that our legal and judicial system functions properly. So this is my first point, the credibility of a judicial system.

The second characteristic goes to the fact that we have a very user-friendly system - common law system. One thing that may be very often can be overlooked is that Hong Kong is the only bilingual common law system using both English and Chinese.

Notwithstanding that China has resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong, one would have naturally expected that Chinese would be the only authentic language, but that's not true. Even in our legislation, in our court judgments, things would be written in both languages, which is of course important to the international community.

The second thing is that we have made tremendous effort to ensure that our law will meet the changing needs of society, not just within Hong Kong but also the international community. I give two examples. The first example is that we have just amended our company ordinance, which came into effect in late May. It provides a scheme to enable companies being operated overseas to re-domicile to Hong Kong, by a very simple mechanism, so that they can enjoy tax advantage, a relatively simple regulatory regime, so on and so forth. I understand that two major insurance companies have indicated that they will re-domicile to Hong Kong probably in November this year. The second example goes to digital assets, the Stablecoins Ordinance. The ordinance will come into effect on August 1. I think it's an indication of our determination to strike a balance. You have to have some sort of regulation, some sort of licensing, but at the same time, you have to enable this digital thing to be able to develop in a healthy manner. So this is my second point, we have a very user-friendly common law system.

The last point, which is really unique, which is something that cannot be found, is our connection with the Mainland legal system. Under ""one country, two systems"", we have our common law system, we do not use the Mainland legal system. It doesn't mean that there's no connection or no linkage between the two systems. On the contrary, there are very important connections between the two legal systems, which are of great practical importance to the international business community. And once again, I wish to use some examples. The first example concerns arbitration. Can arbitration awards in Hong Kong be recognised or enforced in Mainland China? The answer is that we have a very special mutual legal assistance arrangement with Mainland China. There are altogether nine, but suffice for me to mention that's an arrangement which enables an arbitration award in Hong Kong to be easily recognised and enforced in China. It's modelled on a well-known New York convention. So it's no different as any other international award. And another special thing which also about arbitration is that Hong Kong and Mainland China has entered into a very special arrangement to enable arbitration to start or commence in Hong Kong. People engaged in this sort of arbitration would be entitled to apply for interim measures like interim injunction to freeze the assets of the opposing party to preserve evidence in Mainland China by making application in the Mainland court. For example, you start an arbitration in Hong Kong, then you can go to the Mainland court to apply to freeze the assets of your opponent to preserve evidence. I can give you the statistics to see how important and how successful this arrangement is. The arrangement came into existence on the October 1, 2019, and up to mid-May this year, there were altogether around 146 applications. And the value of assets which were subject to this interim preservation order would be around US$5 billion. That will be a very important and practical legal tool to use Hong Kong as a legal dispute resolution centre. And the second more recent example, that I wish to introduce to you, concerns the Greater Bay Area (GBA). The Greater Bay Area consists of Hong Kong, Macau, and mainly the nine important cities in the Guangdong province. The population is 86 million. I think the size is more like Croatia, but the GDP has exceeded Australia. I think it would be top 10 as it seen as a single entity. So a lot of opportunities. So just on the February 14, we have introduced special measures to enable Hong Kong enterprise, if they set up an office or their own company in GBA cities, they would have the right to choose Hong Kong law to govern their contracts. In the old days, there were very serious restrictions. Even if you're a foreign company, a Hong Kong company, if you set up your company in Mainland China, you have no option. You have to use Mainland law to govern your contractual relationship. The second thing is that you can also choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration to resolve any potential dispute. And once again, in the past, that option would not be open. You have to use the dispute resolution mechanism or arbitration in Mainland China. So these are special measures which were recently introduced to give people more options. We can readily understand that, in particular for people outside Hong Kong, they may feel more familiar with Hong Kong's legal system, whether it's used as the governing law or whether it's used as the place to resolve disputes. The choice belongs to the end users, but you have to give people the choice. So we are offering people this choice.

Another important thing is the definition of Hong Kong enterprise. It doesn't mean that it has to be a 100 per cent owned Hong Kong company. So long as there's some Hong Kong interest, say 1 per cent Hong Kong interest. So if you get a business partner who's willing to invest 1 per cent in a business venture, then you will be qualified to be a Hong Kong enterprise. And if you use this in the name of this Hong Kong enterprise, you go into a GBA area, then you can take advantage of the measures that I have just mentioned. I'm using this example to highlight the very unique connection between the Hong Kong common law system and the Mainland legal system, which offers very important practical advantages to the international business community.

Lastly, you may say that I'm just selecting the good news. What about external views on the state of the rule of law in Hong Kong? I wish to refer to two very recent international surveys to support that what I have been telling you is not some sort of self-serving statement trying to paint a rosy picture. Firstly, the IMD, the Institute for Management Development in Switzerland, published a competitiveness survey in June, so about a month ago. In terms of global competitiveness, Hong Kong is the third. In the last survey, we were the fifth, so we moved two places up. We ranked second in terms of government efficiency and also business efficiency. And most importantly, Hong Kong ranked the first when it comes to business legislation, which means our business law and also our tax policy. This is the external view based on a very credible international survey. The second international survey that I wish to refer to is an international survey concerning international arbitration. It's a survey done by the Queen Mary University of London, together with the law firm White & Case. It's a regular survey done once every three or four years. In the very recent survey, Hong Kong is regarded to be the second most preferred seat of arbitration in the world. Hong Kong and Singapore both enjoy the second place. And in fact, Hong Kong is the most preferred place for arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region. So once again, this serves as a very strong piece of objective evidence to demonstrate people's confidence in our legal system.

We are living at a time of uncertainties and challenges, many of these challenges were caused by reasons or factors beyond our control. Some of them goes to geopolitical situations, things like that. The role of Hong Kong can play from the perspective be considered in a wider context, not just as a matter of bilateral relationship between Hong Kong and the Netherlands. It has to be perhaps considered in the wider context of the overall relationship between Europe and China, or perhaps Europe and Asia-Pacific, as a whole. I think the relationship between Europe and China and Hong Kong has become even more relevant and important at this time of great uncertainties and challenges. But amid all these challenges and difficulties, in sharp contrast to these challenges and difficulties, what Hong Kong can offer would be certainty and opportunities. Certainty that you will have a very secure, very user-friendly, very credible legal system to safeguard interests, to manage risk, but enormous opportunities to be found, not just in Hong Kong, not just in the GBA, but China as a whole.

So I do believe, I speak from the bottom of my heart that there are very good reasons for us to remain very confident and optimistic in the future of Hong Kong. And for this, of course, I'm most grateful to the continued support by our friends in this room. I do ask you to continue your support. Whenever people speak in front of you, express any doubt, I do invite you to speak on our behalf to convince them that there's no reason whatsoever to feel pessimistic. There's no reason whatsoever for them to be concerned about the future of Hong Kong, because Hong Kong will still be the Hong Kong that we all love, that we are all familiar with. This is all I wish to say. Thank you very much."
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-08 09:33,2025-07-08 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800272.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."
