DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-02 06:46,2025-09-02 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/02/P2025090200001.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 2) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

SCED: Hong Kong strives to forge closer partnership with Singapore and ASEAN as a whole (with photos),2025-09-01 21:00,2025-09-01 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100539.htm,"âThe Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, today (September 1) visited Singapore to have exchanges with the political and business sectors to forge an even closer relationship between Hong Kong and Singapore, leveraging the complementary advantages of the two places.

This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in Singapore, a milestone underscoring the enduring partnership between Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a whole.

Speaking at a celebration dinner hosted by the Singapore ETO, Mr Yau said that the Singapore ETO, which also covers Vietnam, Laos and India, is the first ETO that Hong Kong has set up in Southeast Asia, followed by the ones in Indonesia and Thailand, and hopefully another one soon in Malaysia. ASEAN is now the fourth-largest economic bloc in the world and has also become Hong Kong's second-largest trading partner.

Noting that ASEAN is Hong Kong's strategic partner at both the regional and global levels, Mr Yau highlighted the importance of partnerships among economies especially in turbulent times, when conflicts destabilise global relations, and tariff-induced uncertainties impede world trade.
ã
Mr Yau stressed that the world economy in the long term is not a zero-sum game and economies can grow together through innovation, investment and trade, and also create new values, generate new wealth and opportunities hand in hand. He added that what exists among economies does not have to be competition, it can be collaboration for a brighter and shared future.

Mr Yau also shared with around 200 guests from the government sector, Chinese and foreign embassies in Singapore, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, business associations, academic institutions and cultural organisations, etc Hong Kong's economic outlook and resilient growth in trade despite the tariff shocks. He added that sparing no efforts to deepen international exchanges and co-operation, Hong Kong will forge more partnerships with other economies. He also expressed gratitude for the Singapore Government's long-standing support for the Singapore ETO and extended his congratulations to the 60th anniversary of the country's independence.

Other notable guests of honour at the dinner included the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry of Singapore, Ms Gan Siow Huang, and the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Singapore, Mr Zhu Jing. Both acknowledged the efforts and achievements of the Singapore ETO over the past three decades and aspired for even closer co-operation in the years ahead.

The dinner featured photos highlighting the Singapore ETO's diverse engagements over the past 30 years. The Director of the Singapore ETO, Mr Owin Fung, noted that through hosting high-level official visits, leading business delegations, and organising events, forums and cultural performances, the office has fostered ever closer ties between Hong Kong and ASEAN countries. An ensemble was also staged by young talented musicians from Hong Kong and Singapore using a vibrant fusion of Chinese and Western instruments to embody the ""East meets West"" spirit, cultural diversity and creative energy of both places.
ã
In addition to attending the celebration dinner, Mr Yau earlier in the day met with the Minister for Manpower and the Minister-in-charge of Energy and Science and Technology of Singapore, Dr Tan See Leng, to brief him on Hong Kong's latest developments such as the Northern Metropolis development, and the vast business opportunities in Hong Kong and also the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area for Singaporean enterprises. They also exchanged views on deepening collaboration between the two places in various areas to bring mutual benefits.
ã
During the visit, Mr Yau also took the opportunity to get a deeper understanding of the development and potential of e-commerce in Singapore and ASEAN markets. As well, Mr Yau visited a family edutainment company specialising in offering fun play activities for young children's learning, social interaction and development. The company now has four outlets in Hong Kong and the fifth one will open soon. Mr Yau had a good exchange with the company's senior management and encouraged the company to continue to use Hong Kong as a base to expand business and tap into the Mainland market.
ã
Mr Yau concluded his visit to Singapore and will proceed to Beijing tomorrow (September 2). He will return to Hong Kong on September 3."
商經局局長：香港致力與新加坡及東盟整體建立更緊密夥伴關係（附圖）,2025-09-01 20:59,2025-09-01 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100538.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（九月一日）訪問新加坡，與當地政商界交流，促進兩地建立更緊密關係，達致優勢互補。

今年亦是香港駐新加坡經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦）成立三十周年，此里程碑足證香港與新加坡以至東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）整體的夥伴關係歷久彌新。

丘應樺在駐新加坡經貿辦舉辦的慶祝晚宴上致辭時表示，駐新加坡經貿辦是香港在東南亞設立的首個經貿辦，服務範圍覆蓋越南、老撾和印度，其後在印尼和泰國相繼設立經貿辦，亦有望快將在馬來西亞設立。目前，東盟是世界第四大經濟體系，亦已成為香港第二大貿易夥伴。

丘應樺指東盟是香港在區域及國際層面的戰略夥伴，並強調在動盪時期，當衝突導致國際關係不穩、關稅引發的不確定性窒礙全球貿易之際，經濟體之間的合作更形重要。

丘應樺強調，長遠而言，世界經濟並非零和遊戲，各經濟體可以透過創新、投資及貿易達致共同發展，並攜手創造新的價值、財富和機遇。他補充，各經濟體之間存在的可以是協作而非競爭，以共建更美好未來。

此外，丘應樺與約200位來自政府機構、中國及外國駐新加坡大使館、亞太區經濟合作組織、工商團體、學術機構及文化團體的嘉賓，分享香港的經濟前景和在關稅衝擊下的強韌貿易增長。他表示，香港將不遺餘力深化國際交往合作，與其他經濟體建立更多夥伴關係。他亦感謝新加坡政府一直以來對駐新加坡經貿辦的支持，並祝賀新加坡獨立六十周年。

其他出席晚宴的主要嘉賓包括新加坡外交部兼貿工部政務部長顏曉芳，以及中國駐新加坡大使館代辦朱憬。他們肯定駐新加坡經貿辦在過去三十年的努力和成果，並期望未來合作更為緊密。

晚宴透過照片回顧，展示駐新加坡經貿辦三十年來的多元化工作。駐新加坡經貿辦處長馮浩然指，透過高層官員和商務代表團訪問，以及各類活動、論壇和文化表演，駐新加坡經貿辦成功促進了香港與東盟各國之間更緊密的聯繫。另外，香港和新加坡優秀的年輕音樂人以中西樂器合奏演出，展現兩地東西薈萃的精神、多元文化和創意活力。

除了出席慶祝晚宴，丘應樺今日較早前與新加坡人力部長兼能源與科技事務主管部長陳詩龍醫生會面，介紹香港的最新發展，包括北部都會區發展，以及香港以至粵港澳大灣區為新加坡企業提供的龐大機遇。雙方亦就深化兩地在多方面的合作以達致互惠互利交換意見。

在新加坡期間，丘應樺亦藉此機會了解電子商貿在當地及東盟市場的發展和潛力。此外，他到訪一間親子教育娛樂公司，該公司專門提供有助幼童學習、社交互動和發展的趣味活動，目前在香港設有四間分店，第五間快將開幕。丘應樺與其高層管理人員交流，鼓勵公司繼續以香港作為擴展業務的基地，並開拓內地市場。

丘應樺結束訪問新加坡行程，明日（九月二日）將轉赴北京。他將於九月三日返港。"

Remarks by SITI at media session,2025-09-01 20:32,2025-09-01 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100717.htm," Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, at a media session after attending the launch event and press briefing on the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 2025 Global Innovation Index Ranking of World's Top 100 Innovation Clusters today (September 1):

Reporter: Given WIPO's report with a new emphasis on VC deals, what is the role of government funds like the HKIC (Hong Kong Investment Corporation) and the ITVF (Innovation and Technology Venture Fund) in attracting private capital and putting investment in start-ups? Will there be more new measures to lure more such capital?

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry: As you know, starting from this year, WIPO has an addition of venture capital deals in the ranking evaluation. This third metric actually is very important to our future development direction. Looking back at the past several years in Hong Kong, we performed very well. For example, we have initiated the Innovation and Technology (Venture) Fund since a few years ago. So far, this ITVF, together with some venture capital of Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, has invested in over 100 companies, investing about HK$1.1 billion and attracting more than HK$18 billion from private companies. This is one example. Another thing: Since a few years ago, the Hong Kong Government has rolled out a policy to support universities to help our young students build start-up companies, including the TSSSU (Technology Start-up Support Scheme for Universities) programme. Let me tell you, in the past several years, we have supported more than 620 companies through the TSSSU programme. All these companies are mainly developed by our young students. The third example I can tell you is that many universities have also made a lot of efforts to support start-up companies. To give you an example: In the City University of Hong Kong, they have very successful ""HK Tech 300"" programme. In the past few years, this ""HK Tech 300"" programme has invested in over 1 000 start-up companies in Hong Kong, among which 80 per cent of the money is seed funding, and the remaining 20 per cent of the money is angel funding. In the future, the Hong Kong Government will roll out an improved Innovation and Technology Venture Fund, and more importantly, starting from next year, we will initiate a new investment programme, called the Innovation and Technology Industry-oriented Fund. Also, we will start to implement the plan of the Pilot I&T Accelerator Scheme to get the most start-ups from all over the world to Hong Kong. I think through this series of policy initiatives, Hong Kong's start-up ecosystem will become more vibrant.

Reporter: According to WIPO, Shenzhen is the main contributor in terms of PCT application within the cluster. As you just mentioned, Hong Kong is planning to pick up on PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) applications, so could you please elaborate more regarding the measures, or any policies the SAR Government is considering or planning to roll out?

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry: Based on my understanding, the chief economist of WIPO mentioned Huawei and Tencent as major players in the PCT applications. I can also tell you, besides big companies, many universities in Hong Kong have seen their patent application numbers increase very rapidly. For the number of the patent application increase in the past two years, our top-100 five universities in Hong Kong have patent applications with the increase rate of 27 per cent and 23.4 per cent. Hong Kong's patent application increases very fast. Take Huawei as an example: Huawei has built a big research institute in Hong Kong Science Park. The number of employees last year has increased to over 700. The number will continue to increase. That means many big companies have set research institutes in Hong Kong. They want to fully utilise advantages of Hong Kong to enhance their R&D (research and development). I believe the patent number in the overall Greater Bay Area will continue to increase. Thank you.

Good evening.

Welcome to tonight's ceremonial dinner. I trust you enjoyed today's inspiring discussions and look forward now to an enjoyable evening.

My thanks, once again, to WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) for choosing Hong Kong to launch the inaugural Global Innovation Cluster Ranking. I'm grateful, too, for the support of the central ministries and authorities.

Let me begin by saying how proud we are that Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Guangzhou together have been named the world's most innovative cluster. This significant achievement speaks volumes about our region's collective commitment to innovation and technology.

In innovation today, no force is more transformative than artificial intelligence. AI is reinventing business models, redefining productivity and revolutionising how we work, communicate and live. Allow me to take this opportunity to say a few words about Hong Kong's vision and strategy in this area.

Fully recognising the value AI can create for our businesses and community, Hong Kong has prioritised AI as a core industry, and a key enabler in upgrading our traditional industries and sectors.

Our AI strategy advances along five key fronts: algorithms, computing power, data, capital and talent.

Algorithms and computing power include investing in our R&D (research and development) capabilities and infrastructure. For example, in this year's Budget, I announced the establishment of the Hong Kong Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute, which will focus on translating AI research into real-world applications. The Institute will be launched next year.

And Cyberport, our digital hub and AI accelerator, operates a supercomputing centre, providing essential support for wider AI applications. The Government is also providing funds to local universities, research institutes and businesses to make use of this computing resource.

Hong Kong is uniquely positioned as a convergence point for data from the Chinese Mainland and the world. And we are now facilitating cross-boundary data flows from the Mainland for R&D, coupled with robust safeguards - crucial for organisations in the biotech and medical fields.

When it comes to capital, Hong Kong is one of the world's leading financial centres. Besides the stock market, we provide a full spectrum of funding options that support enterprises at their various stages of growth. Hong Kong's private equity sector, for example, manages about US$230 billion in assets, ranking No. 2 in Asia, only after the Chinese Mainland.

Talent is the driving force of innovation. Which is why we are strengthening AI education at all levels. We are also forging partnerships with such leading technology firms as Tencent, Alibaba, SenseTime and Lenovo, bringing their expertise directly into classrooms and the community. In addition, we support initiatives such as the Hong Kong Qingyuan Club, a joint initiative of the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence and the Hong Kong Investment Corporation to encourage young AI scientists to engage in global AI exchanges here in Hong Kong.

Our goal is clear: to ensure we have an adequate supply of AI talent, and our next generation is AI-ready, equipped with the skills and knowledge to flourish in an AI-driven world.

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's AI strategy reflects our broader innovation philosophy, in which talent, capital and technology reinforce one another in an open ecosystem.

In that same spirit, I want to assure you that Hong Kong is open and welcoming. We are keen to collaborate with governments, businesses and entrepreneurs from around the world, driving innovation for the benefit of all.

Ladies and gentlemen, I know you will enjoy this special evening and the innovative company all about you.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-01 19:10,2025-09-01 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100606.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月二十四日至三十日）廣東省新增225宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別為830宗（八月十日至十六日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的新增病例數字過去一個月持續遞減，但現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。中心亦呼籲學校按照食物環境衞生署（食環署）的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，務必提醒教職員及學生，應時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。」

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食環署繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成10種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-01 19:10,2025-09-01 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100607.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 1), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 225 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (August 24 to 30), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 830 cases (August 10 to 16) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad. The CHP also urged schools to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. They should also remind staff members and students to enact mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html).

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that they must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

​創新科技及工業局局長會見傳媒談話內容,2025-09-01 18:36,2025-09-01 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100634.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（九月一日）出席世界知識產權組織《2025年全球創新指數》世界百強創新集群排名發布活動後會見傳媒的談話內容：

創新科技及工業局局長：各位媒體朋友，大家下午好。世界知識產權組織剛剛公布了《2025年全球創新指數》世界百強創新集群的排名，當中「深圳—香港—廣州」集群排名全球第一。特區政府對此表示歡迎，這個排名充分體現了粵港澳大灣區卓越的創新能力已經被全世界高度認可，同時非常感謝世界知識產權組織將發布活動首次選址香港舉辦，讓我們都有機會能夠在現場親身目睹這個排名的發布。

近年來，香港創科發展蓬勃，正以非常強勁的活力與粵港澳大灣區其他兄弟城市一起共建完善和具全球競爭力的創科生態。發展創科是香港幾屆特區政府的施政重點，過去數年為了全速發展香港成為國際創新科技中心，特區政府推出了一系列的政策和措施。本屆政府已經推出了三個100億元的計劃，分別為「產學研1+計劃」、「新型工業加速計劃」和「創科產業引導基金」，也推出了「創科加速器先導計劃」。目前在香港「三大創科園區、五大研發機構」一個新的創科體系已經逐漸形成，為香港下一步繼續更好聚集全世界的創科資源和人才提供了重要的平台，並且特區政府透過「政、產、學、研、投」高效合作，已明確了以產業發展為導向的一個大方針，積極推動上中下游協調發展。

下一步，香港會繼續深化與粵港澳大灣區其他兄弟城市的緊密合作，珠聯璧合，大家一起為實現國家成為科技強國而共同努力奮鬥。現在我歡迎記者朋友提問題。

記者：想問一下，「深圳—香港—廣州」集群在過去五年都是排名第二，今次到第一名的時候，你覺得未來有信心可以鞏固這優勢，還有創新科技及工業局可以做甚麼去大力鞏固這優勢？

創新科技及工業局局長：過去五年，「深圳—香港—廣州」創新集群一直排名全球第二。過去五年我們採用的指標主要根據兩個：第一個是關於專利的申請，第二是關於科研期刊發表的文章。今年，世界知識產權組織加了一個新的指標，就是我們的venture capital deals，風險投資活動這個指標。這次之所以「深圳—香港—廣州」集群能夠一下從多年的第二上到第一，除了我們首兩個指標繼續有不錯的表現之外，我們在第三個指標還是有非常好的發展，所以這就使得大灣區集群能夠成為世界排名第一。下一步怎麼做？我想現在這三個指標，可以說是全世界各地都高度重視的三個發展重點，未來我們會繼續強化這三個方面的工作。第一，要繼續增加我們的專利申請數量。第二，要繼續強化我們基礎科研的優勢，要有更多科學文章發表。第三也是非常重要的，我們要有更多風險投資。在香港實際上要發展更多初創企業，我想這三個方向是我們下一步繼續努力的發展目標和方向。

記者：想跟進一下，就是香港跟內地的合作。剛才陳部長也提到，比如說在河套合作區，積極地跟內地對接，在河套區未來的合作方向是怎麼樣？政策會如何促進香港跟內地的融合？會有甚麼措施拆牆鬆綁、促進河套區的發展？

創新科技及工業局局長：大家看到這次排名之所以成功，有賴於粵港澳大灣區我們一些核心城市的集體合作，「深圳—香港—廣州」這個集群實際上代表了我們未來發展的方向。下一步，我相信特區政府會進一步深化與大灣區其他兄弟城市的緊密合作。剛才談到河套是我們一個重要的合作平台，今年下半年河套香港園區就要開園，目前很多一些來自海內外的機構已經開始準備入駐。這裏面有非常好的科技公司，也有國際最頂尖的大學，陸續地進入河套。過去幾星期，我們跟深圳以及國家有關方面正在緊鑼密鼓地商討一些具體的創新要素跨境流動，包括數據以及生物樣本等等，務求使得今後我們河套的發展是一個獨特的、一個新的創科發展園區。除了河套以外，我們還有前海、南沙，這些都是「十四五」規劃中粵港澳大灣區重要的合作平台。我相信未來香港一定會深化與大灣區兄弟城市的合作，大家做到珠聯璧合、共同發展。"

Water Supplies Department establishes Pipeline Robots Joint Laboratory (with photos),2025-09-01 18:03,2025-09-01 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100208.htm,"  The Water Supplies Department (WSD) today (1 September) announced the establishment of the Pipeline Robots Joint Laboratory, which focuses on developing pipeline robotics technologies and promoting the research and development for local technologies of water mains inspection robots, named Intelligent Pipescope. These robots will be used to assess the internal conditions of pressurised water mains of the water supply network. The WSD signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Shenzhen Bwell Technology Co Ltd to jointly develop the relevant technologies.

In his speech at the ceremony, the Director of Water Supplies, Mr Roger Wong, stated that the WSD has committed to collaborating with various institutions to develop and apply advanced technologies in driving the development of smart water in Hong Kong. The WSD is actively exploring innovative methods to enhance the skills and efficiency of water mains inspections. The WSD expects that, through the Pipeline Robots Joint Laboratory, the development of robots for operating in diverse pipeline conditions will be accelerated. This will enable highly accurate inspections, thereby reducing the risks of pipe bursts and leaks, and potentially extending to monitoring water quality.

The core objective of the Pipeline Robots Joint Laboratory is to independently develop multifunctional advanced pipeline robotics technologies, including acoustic sensors, high-definition cameras, and positioning instruments. These robots will also utilise artificial intelligence to analyse relevant data in order to address the unique characteristics of Hong Kong's water supply network, which includes variations in materials, high water pressure, and numerous bends and branches. Taking into account the rapid development and mature applications of robotics technologies on the Mainland in recent years, the WSD considered that robotics technologies that suit Hong Kong's needs will be developed more effectively through close collaboration with a local university and a Mainland pipeline robotics developer. At the same time, the unique complexity of the water supply network in Hong Kong will serve as an ideal testing platform, facilitating the entry of Mainland pipeline robotics technologies into international markets and leveraging Hong Kong's unique position to connect with both the Mainland and the world.

The WSD has consistently strived to optimise water supply services through the efficient use of resources and technologies to meet the needs of Hong Kong's vast population. The establishment of the Pipeline Robots Joint Laboratory represents a significant milestone in the development of smart water. It is anticipated that this initiative will promote more collaboration and application of smart detection technologies between the Mainland and Hong Kong, contributing to positioning both the nation and Hong Kong as global benchmarks in smart water."

This year, the ranking newly includes the number of venture capital deals as a new metric. With Hong Kong as an international financial centre, and the Mainland and Hong Kong ranking first and second respectively in Asia's venture capital and private equity fund management, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster has excelled at channelling capital to support the translation of innovative ideas into material outcomes.

  ""Fast-tracking innovation and technology (I&T) development has been a policy priority of this Government. Over the past few years, the Government has rolled out a series of policy initiatives to ensure technology, capital and talent reinforce one another, as well as expediting co-operation and collaboration with our GBA sister cities, to press ahead with the development of Hong Kong into an international I&T centre. In particular, the Government has announced three $10 billion schemes, namely the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme, the New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme, and the Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund, alongside the Pilot I&T Accelerator Scheme. Moreover, Hong Kong has been supporting the growth of start-ups and is committed to attracting world-class leading enterprises of cutting-edge technology and talent to establish their presence in Hong Kong, in order to enrich our I&T ecosystem. As Asia's premier international financial centre, Hong Kong has been broadening the channels of financing and listing over the past few years, catering specifically to the needs of new economy and tech companies. This facilitates more quality enterprises in raising funds and expanding their businesses in Hong Kong.

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-09-01 17:00,2025-09-01 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100555.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 1) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From August 24 to 30, the CHP recorded three LD cases. Among these, one was an imported case and two were community-acquired cases. All of the patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:

Community-acquired cases:

a 76-year-old male patient living in Kwun Tong District; and
a 65-year-old male patient living in Eastern District.


Imported case:

a 61-year-old male patient who travelled to the Mainland during the incubation period.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that all three cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of August 30, 114 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


  The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and

香港與世界知識產權組織簽署「WIPO Lex裁判文書」數據庫諒解備忘錄（附圖）,2025-09-01 16:53,2025-09-01 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100453.htm,"香港特別行政區政府今日（九月一日）與世界知識產權組織（WIPO）簽署有關「WIPO Lex裁判文書」數據庫的諒解備忘錄，加強資訊共享，以共建更緊密、知識層面更豐富的全球知識產權社群。

「WIPO Lex裁判文書」數據庫提供免費和公開的全球重要知識產權相關司法判決。行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》中提出，香港將在中央政府的支持下參與數據庫。根據諒解備忘錄，香港將向數據庫提供司法機構在知識產權領域中具指導性的判決，便利國際知識產權界取得相關判決，同時彰顯香港知識產權司法水平。

諒解備忘錄在財政司司長陳茂波、WIPO副總幹事王彬穎和高等法院首席法官潘兆初見證下，由知識產權署署長黃福來和WIPO助理總幹事馬爾科．阿萊曼簽署。

陳茂波於簽署儀式致辭時指出，香港參與「WIPO Lex裁判文書」數據庫，具有重要意義。「在『一國兩制』下，香港是全國唯一、並以中英文雙語實行普通法的地區，在知識產權保護方面獲得國際廣泛認可，亦是解決涉及內地及海外當事人知識產權爭議的重要地點。香港法院的判決為國際法律界提供重要參考。」

陳茂波表示，香港與WIPO加強合作，不僅能提升香港在國際司法判例交流中的角色，亦鞏固香港作為區域知識產權貿易中心及法律服務樞紐的地位。「通過提升香港知識產權制度在全球範圍的透明度，我們進一步提升國際企業和知識產權擁有人對在香港投資和進行創新活動的信心。他們可充分利用香港可靠和獲國際認同的法律體系，以商業化和保護其知識產權資產。」他感謝中央政府和WIPO多年來對香港知識產權工作的堅定支持，香港會繼續在國際知識產權合作中擔當積極角色，並為國家於二○三五年前建設成知識產權強國作出更大貢獻。

潘兆初法官在簽署儀式致辭時表示：「根據諒解備忘錄，香港法院在知識產權領域中具代表性的判決，將可以在『WIPO Lex裁判文書』數據庫上閱覧。香港將繼續在提供更便捷的方式查閱知識產權判決、加強全球對最新常見法律問題的司法方法的理解，以及促進知識產權國際合作方面發揮重要作用。」

來自本地知識產權界、法律界、研發界和工商團體的代表亦有出席今日的簽署儀式。"
Hong Kong and WIPO sign MOU on WIPO Lex-Judgments database (with photos),2025-09-01 16:53,2025-09-01 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100454.htm," The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government today (September 1) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on co-operation with regard to the WIPO Lex-Judgments database to strengthen information sharing, with a view to jointly building a more connected and informative global intellectual property (IP) community.

 The WIPO Lex-Judgments database provides free, open access to leading judicial decisions relating to IP from around the world. The Chief Executive in his 2024 Policy Address announced that Hong Kong will participate in the database with the Central Government's support. Under the MOU, Hong Kong will contribute leading IP judgments from the Judiciary to the database, facilitating the international IP community's access to such judgments, while at the same time showcasing the quality of Hong Kong's IP-related judicial judgments.

 In the witness of the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan; Deputy Director General of WIPO Ms Wang Binying; and the Chief Judge of the High Court, Mr Justice Jeremy Poon, the MOU was signed by the Director of Intellectual Property, Mr David Wong, and Assistant Director General of WIPO Mr Marco Alemán.

 In his speech at the signing ceremony, Mr Chan said that Hong Kong's participation in the database carries special significance. ""Under the 'one country, two systems' framework, Hong Kong is the only territory in China practising common law, and in both Chinese and English. Its protection of IP is widely recognised. As a trusted venue for resolving IP disputes involving parties from both the Mainland and abroad, our judgments serve as valuable references to the international legal community.""

 Mr Chan indicated Hong Kong's strengthened collaboration with WIPO would not only enhance its role in the international exchange of jurisprudence, but also strengthen Hong Kong's standing as a leading regional hub for IP trading and legal services. ""By enhancing the global transparency of our IP legal regime, we provide greater confidence to international businesses and rights holders to invest and pursue innovation activities here. They can count on our reliable, world-class legal infrastructure for the commercialisation and protection of their IP assets."" He also thanked the Central People's Government and WIPO for their strong support to Hong Kong's IP initiatives over the past years, and reiterated that Hong Kong remains firmly committed to playing an active role in international IP co-operation and contributing to China's vision of becoming a global IP powerhouse by 2035.

 Also addressing the signing ceremony, Mr Justice Poon said, ""Under the MOU, representative IP judgments of the Hong Kong courts will be made available on the WIPO Lex-Judgments database. Hong Kong will continue to play an important role in providing better access of IP judgments, enhancing global understanding of judicial approaches to the latest common legal issues, and contributing to international co-operation for promoting IP.""

 Today's signing ceremony was also attended by representatives from the local IP community, the legal profession, the research and development sector and business bodies."

  Table 4 shows the movements of the value and volume of total retail sales in terms of the year-on-year rate of change for a month compared with the same month in the preceding year based on the original series, and in terms of the rate of change for a three-month period compared with the preceding three-month period based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The classification of retail establishments follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification (HSIC) Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  These retail sales statistics measure the sales receipts in respect of goods sold by local retail establishments and are primarily intended for gauging the short-term business performance of the local retail sector. Data on retail sales are collected from local retail establishments through the Monthly Survey of Retail Sales (MRS). Local retail establishments with and without physical shops are covered in MRS and their sales, both through conventional shops and online channels, are included in the retail sales statistics.

  The retail sales statistics cover consumer spending on goods but not on services (such as those on housing, catering, medical care and health services, transport and communication, financial services, education and entertainment) which account for over 50% of the overall consumer spending. Moreover, they include spending on goods in Hong Kong by visitors but exclude spending outside Hong Kong by Hong Kong residents. Hence they should not be regarded as indicators for measuring overall consumer spending.

  Users interested in the trend of overall consumer spending should refer to the data series of private consumption expenditure (PCE), which is a major component of the Gross Domestic Product published at quarterly intervals. Compiled from a wide range of data sources, PCE covers consumer spending on both goods (including goods purchased from all channels) and services by Hong Kong residents whether locally or abroad. Please refer to the C&SD publication ""Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Component"" for more details.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey of Retail Sales"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080003&scode=530).

Deputy Director-General Wang Binying (Deputy Director General of World Intellectual Property Organization, Ms Wang Binying), å°æ¬çé³å®¶æå¯é¨é· (Vice Minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Dr Chen Jiachang), å¼µå¿æå¯å±é·(Deputy Commissioner of the China National Intellectual Property Administration, Dr Zhang Zhicheng), çæ·å¯å±é· (Deputy Director of Bureau III of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Wang Jie), çåæé¨é· (Director-General of the Department of Educational, Scientific and Technological Affairs of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Dr Wang Weiming), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to join you today for the launch of the Global Innovation Index (GII) Ranking of the World's Top 100 Innovation Clusters.

And a warm welcome to the scientists, academics, policymakers and business leaders joining us from around the world. Today's gathering presents an exceptional opportunity to exchange insights, learn from one another, and explore new avenues for collaboration in innovation and technology.

Let me also express my sincere appreciation to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for selecting Hong Kong as the host city for this landmark occasion. My gratitude also goes to the central authorities and organisations for their steadfast support in making this event a reality.

The evolving GII Innovation Clusters

For years now, the GII's Science and Technology Cluster ranking has been globally recognised as a rigorous assessment of innovation concentration. By analysing patent filings and scientific publications, it offers governments, investors and researchers a valuable snapshot of regional strengths and potential partnerships.

This year, the ranking has been revamped as “Innovation Clusters”, with the timely and judicious addition of venture capital deals as a key indicator. Innovation today is not only driven by ideas and talent, but also by capital - the essential fuel enabling inspiring ideas to emerge as real-world enterprises.

Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area: a leading innovation powerhouse

Allow me to turn to Hong Kong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Together, we are exceptionally well positioned to become one of the world's most dynamic and influential innovation clusters, with Hong Kong playing a pivotal role.

Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong enjoys unparalleled advantages. We have seamless and often priority access to the GBA and the broader Mainland market. No less important, we uphold the rule of law, maintain robust intellectual property protection, ensure the free flow of capital, data and talent, and are fully aligned with international standards and best practices.

Let me highlight three areas - technology, capital and talent - in which Hong Kong offers unique value.

First, technology. Hong Kong is a centre of academic and research excellence. We are home to five universities ranked among the world's top 100 - three of which are in the global top 20 in artificial intelligence and data science, and two in the top 25 for medical sciences. Our city also hosts 15 State Key Laboratories and six National Engineering Research Centres.

In recent years, we have made significant investments to strengthen our entire innovation chain, from fundamental research to outcome commercialisation and advanced manufacturing. We are strategically focused on sectors in which we hold clear advantages: artificial intelligence, biotech, fintech, new energy and new materials.

We are also proactive in attracting leading global enterprises with cutting-edge technologies to Hong Kong. To date, we have welcomed more than 80 such companies, committing a total investment of about US$6.5 billion, while creating more than 20 000 high-quality jobs.

Collaboration with our sister cities in the GBA further amplifies our potential. Guangzhou and Shenzhen lead in application and deployment, while Dongguan and Huizhou have compelling strengths in advanced manufacturing. Together, these cities offer immense production capacity, commercialisation opportunities and access to a vast consumer market.

To accelerate this collaboration, Hong Kong is developing its Northern Metropolis. A strategic area bordering Shenzhen, it covers one-third of Hong Kong's landmass. It will include the Shenzhen–Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, which will pioneer cross-boundary policies that enable the seamless flow of talent, capital, data and other resources.

Second, capital. Hong Kong is Asia's premier financial centre. We offer deep liquidity, a wide spectrum of financing channels and a supportive environment for innovation.

Consider our stock market. In the first seven months of this year, Hong Kong led the world in IPO fundraising, with 53 new listings raising about US$16 billion. Follow-on fundraising reached US$44 billion, nearly double the figure over the same period in 2024. Over the years, we have introduced targeted reforms to boost the listing of innovation and technology companies.

Beyond the equities market, Hong Kong is blessed with a vibrant ecosystem of angel investors, venture capital and private equity funds, supporting companies at every stage of growth.

We are also committed to nurturing patient capital. In 2022, we established the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC). It invests directly and co-invests with private partners in strategic sectors such as hard tech, biotech and green technology. To date, the HKIC has invested in more than 120 projects across various sectors, leveraging more than five dollars of market capital for every single dollar it invested.

Third, talent, the cornerstone of successful innovation. More than home to top-tier universities and research institutes, Hong Kong offers exceptional quality of life. With a safe and cosmopolitan environment, world-class education and abundant career opportunities across finance, technology and beyond, Hong Kong is a city where talent can flourish.

We are attracting global innovation talent through a variety of admission schemes, including overseas Chinese scientists and researchers. With Hong Kong's international outlook and the GBA's vast market potential, we are confident that our region will continue to attract the brightest minds from around the world.

Concluding remarks

Taken together, Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area combine the strengths of the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area - bringing together world-class tech research, innovative companies, deep financial markets, manufacturing capabilities and a massive consumer base.

Ladies and gentlemen, later today, you will hear from prominent speakers across the GBA and other global innovation clusters. They will share their insights on the opportunities that lie ahead in their regions.

I trust that today’s dynamic discussions will inspire even greater collaboration across borders and disciplines. And I wish you an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, Asia's world city. Thank you very much."

Deputy Director-General Wang Binying (Deputy Director General of World Intellectual Property Organization, Ms Wang Binying), å°æ¬çé³å®¶æå¯é¨é· (Vice Minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Dr Chen Jiachang), å¼µå¿æå¯å±é·(Deputy Commissioner of the China National Intellectual Property Administration, Dr Zhang Zhicheng), çæ·å¯å±é· (Deputy Director of Bureau III of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Wang Jie), çåæé¨é· (Director-General of the Department of Educational, Scientific and Technological Affairs of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Dr Wang Weiming), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to join you today for the launch of the Global Innovation Index (GII) Ranking of the World's Top 100 Innovation Clusters.

And a warm welcome to the scientists, academics, policymakers and business leaders joining us from around the world. Today's gathering presents an exceptional opportunity to exchange insights, learn from one another, and explore new avenues for collaboration in innovation and technology.

Let me also express my sincere appreciation to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for selecting Hong Kong as the host city for this landmark occasion. My gratitude also goes to the central authorities and organisations for their steadfast support in making this event a reality.

The evolving GII Innovation Clusters

For years now, the GII's Science and Technology Cluster ranking has been globally recognised as a rigorous assessment of innovation concentration. By analysing patent filings and scientific publications, it offers governments, investors and researchers a valuable snapshot of regional strengths and potential partnerships.

This year, the ranking has been revamped as “Innovation Clusters”, with the timely and judicious addition of venture capital deals as a key indicator. Innovation today is not only driven by ideas and talent, but also by capital - the essential fuel enabling inspiring ideas to emerge as real-world enterprises.

Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area: a leading innovation powerhouse

Allow me to turn to Hong Kong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Together, we are exceptionally well positioned to become one of the world's most dynamic and influential innovation clusters, with Hong Kong playing a pivotal role.

Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong enjoys unparalleled advantages. We have seamless and often priority access to the GBA and the broader Mainland market. No less important, we uphold the rule of law, maintain robust intellectual property protection, ensure the free flow of capital, data and talent, and are fully aligned with international standards and best practices.

Let me highlight three areas - technology, capital and talent - in which Hong Kong offers unique value.

First, technology. Hong Kong is a centre of academic and research excellence. We are home to five universities ranked among the world's top 100 - three of which are in the global top 20 in artificial intelligence and data science, and two in the top 25 for medical sciences. Our city also hosts 15 State Key Laboratories and six National Engineering Research Centres.

In recent years, we have made significant investments to strengthen our entire innovation chain, from fundamental research to outcome commercialisation and advanced manufacturing. We are strategically focused on sectors in which we hold clear advantages: artificial intelligence, biotech, fintech, new energy and new materials.

We are also proactive in attracting leading global enterprises with cutting-edge technologies to Hong Kong. To date, we have welcomed more than 80 such companies, committing a total investment of about US$6.5 billion, while creating more than 20 000 high-quality jobs.

Collaboration with our sister cities in the GBA further amplifies our potential. Guangzhou and Shenzhen lead in application and deployment, while Dongguan and Huizhou have compelling strengths in advanced manufacturing. Together, these cities offer immense production capacity, commercialisation opportunities and access to a vast consumer market.

To accelerate this collaboration, Hong Kong is developing its Northern Metropolis. A strategic area bordering Shenzhen, it covers one-third of Hong Kong's landmass. It will include the Shenzhen–Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, which will pioneer cross-boundary policies that enable the seamless flow of talent, capital, data and other resources.

Second, capital. Hong Kong is Asia's premier financial centre. We offer deep liquidity, a wide spectrum of financing channels and a supportive environment for innovation.

教育局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-01 16:24,2025-09-01 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100506.htm,"以下是教育局局長蔡若蓮博士今日（九月一日）上午出席大埔舊墟公立學校開學禮後與傳媒的談話內容：

教育局局長：各位傳媒朋友、各位市民，今日是新學年的第一日，是開學日。我在此祝願全港學校開學事事順利，老師工作愉快，同學學業進步。

今日我來到大埔舊墟公立學校，參加了學校的開學禮，並在開學禮前有機會參觀，了解同學在學校的學習生活。我很開心來到這所學校，見到同學精神奕奕，充滿信心迎接新學年。一來到學校，我便看到中樂團和鼓隊，亦看到同學準備了各種各樣在數字教育方面的學習成果與我分享。我十分開心和感謝他們令我感受到，今時今日同學的學習不再單靠老師傳授知識，更多是自己主動學習和互動，善用資訊科技和數字教育發展帶來的各種各樣有趣有效的學習方式和工具。

由本學年開始，我們將在小一和小四推行人文科和科學科。除了善用數字教育提升學習效能和興趣外，我希望學校和同學善用這兩個新學科，加強人文方面的修為和內涵，同時提升科學探究精神，尤其是小學科學科，我們強調同學在探究中學習，不依賴紙筆評估，減少同學的考試和學業上的壓力。我希望大家珍惜新學年的開始，亦期待每位同學為自己編寫精彩的故事，多謝大家。

記者：「借殼辦學」方面，現時有多少間學校已被列入教育局的「黑名單」？另外，就安博小學，現時究竟有多少個學生？見到工程尚未完成，是否不理想？會否要求該學校何時之前要完成工程？

教育局局長：就「借殼辦學」，我們得悉並取得足夠證據後便立即處理，包括取消該學校的註冊。如懷疑有違規行為，我們亦即時聯絡學校，要求解釋和提交報告，嚴肅懲處違規行為，包括停止該校的收生和辦學。目前來說，我們已處理有問題的學校，亦正密切跟進有懷疑的學校。我們亦設立了突擊巡查小隊，並將列明私立學校辦學的實務守則，以及即將推出私立學校以自願方式表列的名冊，讓大家查閱可信賴、具誠信和合法合規辦學的私立學校，我們會密切留意情況。

就安博官立小學（安博）今日開學，我知道一切順利。我們都明白暑假期間經歷了數次惡劣天氣，工程因此受到影響。事實上，很多時候學校的大型維修或建築工程均需在學校長假期進行。我知道不單是安博出現這類情況，個別學校的大型工程亦有少許部分受天氣影響。安博開學前已經專家評估，確保同學和老師的安全，因此在今日順利開學。我亦了解到，安博今年有六班，一切順利。

記者：有中學提早了半個月開學，稱多年來已有這個做法，這個做法是否合乎教育局的規矩？會否之後檢視有否其他中學有相同的情況？第二個問題是，開學前已經有兩個學童自殺，上半年亦有17宗，接下來如何確保學童避免因為壓力過大而又有自殺問題？最後，我知道學校都陸續由一年四考變一年三考，剛才有學生關注三考，可能考試內容會更難、考更多，反而變相是一種壓力，如何確保學校不會堆積（課業內容）給學生考？

教育局局長：第一，就學校提早半個月開學，每間學校的情況不同，同學能力或學校對學生的學習支援方法也不同。有些學校因同學在高年級需要更多時間為某些學科增加學習課時，這是因應同學多元學習需要的照顧策略，同時得到辦學團體和校董會支持。有些（學校）不只為高年班，亦為初中、中一同學提供適應銜接的過渡期，學校一般都會善用暑假時間，幫助同學應付不同的學習需要。

第二，就精神健康問題，我們非常關注，並嘗試用各種各樣方法、想方設法幫助同學，讓他們在健康愉快的環境成長，包括大力與學界和社會合作推廣《4Rs精神健康約章》，提醒同學注意休息、多放鬆和建立良好人際關係，同時鍛煉自己的抗逆能力。另外，在學校內，我們採用全校參與模式，提供三層支援。當然，沒有最好，只有更好，面對社會急劇轉變，同學和社會面對的精神健康問題越來越複雜，我們會繼續與不同專業和持份者一起努力，想方設法提升同學和老師的精神健康。

第三個問題是關於一年考三次和一年考四次。我相信就評估的安排，學校一定會與家長溝通，因應學校實際教學情況和同學情況，與校長、老師和學生溝通，為同學作最合適的安排。其實所有評估考試均希望能回饋教學，讓老師知道如何調整教學進度或速度，同時讓同學和家長了解學習情況，盡快診斷學習需要，調節教學。

記者：提早開學方面，局方會否有限制？若有學校稱根據學生需要，可能早一個月開學，（教育局）會否有最低要求，確保學校不能濫用？

教育局局長：目前我們對學校上課日數有明確要求，有下限但沒有上限。正如我之前所說，不同學校背景不同，同學有不同學習需要，最重要的是與家長、同學和老師有良好溝通，大家有共識為同學學習福祉作最好安排。我們會留意情況，亦在此感謝學校因應不同情況照顧同學學習需要。

記者：近日有不同報道均指出，取消2,500元津貼令很多家長十分吃力。局長昨日（八月三十一日）亦指出，會增加資源確保不同需要的學生都可以得到支援，當中會否有一些免審查的補助、甚至考慮恢復2,500元津貼？剛才亦提過，開學前有很多宗青少年墮樓的案件，是否全部涉及開學的壓力？其實暑假少接觸老師或社工，是否就此錯過主動（找到）學生問題的機會？是否有需要、或會否有措施令學校在長假期會cover（涵蓋）到學生的情緒問題？

教育局局長：2,500元學生津貼方面，我們的教育資源和社會資源有限。我們希望提高所有公帑資源的效能，集中資源幫助最有需要的同學。除了學校的全方位學習津貼，或照顧學習差異、對非華語和有特殊學習需要同學的津貼外，我們亦為經濟有困難的同學提供各種經濟幫助，包括在校免費午膳和上網費津貼計劃。我們會密切留意，亦會注意同學的實際需要，同時容許學校因應實際情況對一些因家庭變故而有經濟需要的同學作出特別安排。未來我們亦會朝這方向，更加精準和有針對性地幫助有經濟需要的同學。

至於剛才提到長假期間我們可如何關心同學的精神健康，正如我之前所說，目前我們面對的社會越來越複雜，大家亦非常關心同學的精神健康問題，因此長假期除了學校安排一些愉快和有益身心的活動給同學外，我亦鼓勵不同持份者，包括家長或相關團體，整個社會總動員，一起關心年青一代的健康愉快成長。多謝。"

Professional Services Advancement Support Scheme invites new round of applications,2025-09-01 16:00,2025-09-01 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100487.htm,"The Main Programme under the Professional Services Advancement Support Scheme (PASS) is inviting a new round of applications for project proposals starting today (September1) from non-profit-distributing organisations such as professional bodies, trade and industrial organisations and research institutes.

PASS, with a total allocation of $200million, aims at funding non-profit-making industry-led projects to increase exchanges and co-operation between Hong Kong's professional services and external counterparts, promote relevant publicity activities, and enhance the standards and external competitiveness of Hong Kong's professional services.

The maximum grant for each approved project under the Main Programme of PASS is $3million or 90per cent of the total eligible project cost, whichever is lower. A wide range of professional services, such as accounting, legal and dispute resolution, architecture, engineering, healthcare, information and communications technology, design and technical testing and analysis, are eligible for the Main Programme. Sector-specific projects and cross-sectoral projects are both welcome. Expenses directly incurred for implementing a project, such as manpower costs, venue and set-up costs, production and promotion costs, and the project team and active participants' travel and accommodation costs outside Hong Kong, are typically eligible for funding support under the Scheme. Funding support may also be provided for travel and accommodation costs incurred by participants of relatively longer professional internships or attachment programmes outside Hong Kong which are funded by the Main Programme.

Up to early August2025, more than 120projects had been funded under the Main Programme, including project deliverables in and outside Hong Kong. The deliverables include capacity-building programmes for enhancing the standards of local professionals, such as training programmes, workshops and study tours; outreach and promotional activities for showcasing the strengths of Hong Kong's professional services, such as roadshows, promotional seminars and participation in exhibitions outside Hong Kong; exchange activities for deepening interaction between Hong Kong professionals and their external counterparts, such as visits to other economies and international conferences and seminars held in Hong Kong; and research projects on potential external markets for Hong Kong professional services and development of best practice guidelines and manuals for professionals. Details about the Main Programme and its funded projects are available at www.pass.gov.hk/main/en/home.

Furthermore, with a view to stepping up the promotion of Hong Kong's competitive edges and professional services to the Mainland and overseas markets, $50million has been set aside for the Professionals Participation Subsidy Programme (PSP) under PASS to subsidise Hong Kong major professional bodies to participate in relevant activities organised by the Government (such as Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices) and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council after the pandemic situation has stabilised. Details of the PSP and its list of activities are available at www.pass.gov.hk/psp. Hong Kong professionals from the eligible professional sectors under PASS may make use of the PSP subsidy to join the relevant activities.

The Main Programme and the PSP receive applications for project and activity proposals all year round, and they are processed on a quarterly basis. The deadline for the new round of applications is November30,2025. A briefing session will be held this month for organisations interested in applying for the PASS funding. One-on-one consultations are also available upon request for discussing preliminary project ideas or projects in the planning stage. To register for the briefing session, schedule a consultation, or for other enquiries, please contact the PASS Secretariat at 36555418 or pass@cedb.gov.hk."

SED joins primary and secondary students and teachers to usher in new school year (with photos),2025-09-01 15:42,2025-09-01 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100480.htm,"The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, visited Tai Po Old Market Public School and Munsang College this morning (September 1) to join their school-opening ceremonies and commence the new school year with the students and teachers.

Dr Choi first visited Tai Po Old Market Public School. Speaking at the ceremony, she said that students are living in a fast-changing world with the rapid development of innovative technology. The Education Bureau (EDB) is committed to helping students leverage technology to make learning more effective and fun. The initiatives include introducing AI education to the curricula, strengthening professional training for teachers, promoting media and information literacy, and supporting schools to use innovative technologies to assist teaching.

She said that she was delighted with the school having become a Digital Education Centre of Excellence this academic year. She praised the school for continuously enhancing its school-based curriculum, organically integrating the teaching contents of humanities, science and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) subjects, and incorporating values education, national identity and innovative problem-solving elements, thereby enriching students' learning experiences. Moreover, the school is committed to creating a ""smart and happy campus"" as the learning environment. It has set up the 60iLAB AI Innovation and Technology (I&T) Learning Laboratory, a technology park and an IEco ecological park, with an aim of enhancing students' learning interest and effectiveness, and cultivating their innovative thinking.

Dr Choi also toured the school's I&T facilities, and interacted with students and teachers to learn about the school's achievements in digital education. She listened to students' presentations of I&T projects and particularly commended the projects' integration of innovative technology with Chinese culture. Dr Choi said that she hoped the school would make good use of the new subjects of primary humanities and science to strengthen students' humanistic qualities and spirit of scientific exploration.

Dr Choi then attended the Centenary School Year Commencement Ceremony of Munsang College. In her speech, she said that the EDB places great emphasis on values education as a cornerstone of whole-person development, and prioritises national identity and law-abidingness, integrating these principles into national security education. Building on these values, Munsang College exemplifies its practical application through organising various related activities such as Chinese Culture Week and student exchange activities with sister schools on the Mainland, deepening students' understanding and appreciation of Chinese culture and heritage.

She also commended the school for its dedication to promoting mental health on campus and active participation in the EDB's 4Rs Mental Health Charter (rest, relaxation, relationship and resilience) to enhance mental health awareness among students, teachers and parents. In addition, the school encourages students to not only pursue academic excellence but also take part in diverse learning experiences and devote themselves to serving others. This ethos aligns closely with the EDB's vision for whole-person development.

Dr Choi expressed gratitude to the teaching teams of both schools for their devotion to nurturing students. She encouraged students to seize the opportunities of the new school year, keep learning and practicing, and strive to enhance their abilities and qualities for contribution to the country's development in the future."

Deputy Director-General Wang (Deputy Director General of WIPO, Ms Wang Binying), Justice Poon (Chief Judge of the High Court, Mr Justice Jeremy Poon), Director-General Zhou (Director-General of the Department of Treaty and Law, Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR, Ms Zhou Qian), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to this event, especially the distinguished delegation from the World Intellectual Property Organization led by Deputy Director General Wang.

Signing of MOU with WIPO

This morning, we gather to witness the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding that marks the Hong Kong SAR's participation in the WIPO Lex-Judgments database. It is another milestone in our engagement with the global IP (intellectual property) community.

Since its launch in 2020, the WIPO Lex-Judgments database has provided free and open access to leading judicial decisions on IP from around the world. It now features more than 2,200 decisions from over 40 jurisdictions, and continues to grow in both scope and influence.

Access to important and precedent-setting cases is a valuable resource for judges, IP practitioners, policymakers and users across the IP ecosystem. It enables better understanding of complex, cross-border IP issues. It helps innovators and businesses navigate IP environments in other jurisdictions. And it strengthens judicial systems worldwide in keeping pace with the evolving landscape of IP law, particularly in the face of rapid technological advancements. Ultimately, it contributes to a more connected, transparent and coherent global IP framework.

Hong Kong's participation in WIPO Lex-Judgment database

China has been a contributor to this important database since its inception. Today, Hong Kong's participation carries special significance for a number of reasons.

First, it enhances Hong Kong's contribution to the international exchange of jurisprudence. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong is the only territory in China practising common law, and in both Chinese and English. Our Judiciary exercises powers independently, and is widely respected locally and internationally. Our protection of intellectual property is widely recognised. In fact, we rank sixth globally in IP rights protection in this year's IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook.

Indeed, as a trusted venue for resolving IP disputes involving parties from both the Mainland and abroad, our judgments often serve as valuable references to the international legal community.

Second, our participation further consolidates Hong Kong's position as a regional hub for IP trading and legal services. By enhancing the global transparency of our IP legal regime, we provide greater confidence to international businesses and rights holders to invest and pursue innovation activities here. They can count on our reliable, world-class legal infrastructure for the commercialisation and protection of their IP assets.

Third, Hong Kong's involvement in the database will foster deeper connections and collaboration with global counterparts in the IP field. It will enrich academic and legal research, encourage judicial dialogue, and help ensure that our jurisprudence remains at the forefront of global IP development.

Deepening collaboration with WIPO

Ladies and gentlemen, I am also pleased to note that our collaboration with WIPO is deepening in many other areas.

This afternoon, we will cohost the launch of the 2025 Global Innovation Index Ranking of the World’s Top 100 Innovation Clusters - an event jointly organised by WIPO and our country.

The back-to-back hosting of these two important events in Hong Kong is a strong testament to the Central Government's unwavering support for Hong Kong's development as a regional IP trading centre and a global innovation and technology hub.

We are also grateful to WIPO and the China National Intellectual Property Administration for their support in establishing a Technology and Innovation Support Centre in Hong Kong. This centre will empower our innovation and technology sector by helping businesses leverage the patent system, access high-quality IP data, and build capacity and networks, thereby further strengthening our innovation ecosystem.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, none of these achievements would have been possible without the steadfast support of WIPO and the Central People's Government.

Hong Kong remains firmly committed to playing an active role in international IP co-operation and contributing to China's vision of becoming a global IP powerhouse by 2035.

Before I close, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Judiciary for upholding the rule of law and delivering judicial decisions of the highest standard.

Thank you very much."

"Keynote speech by SCST at Redefining Hong Kong: Culture, Sports & Tourism forum (English only)",2025-09-01 13:12,2025-09-01 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100352.htm,"Following is the keynote speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism , Miss Rosanna Law, at the Redefining Hong Kong: Culture, Sports & Tourism forum today (September 1):

Catherine (Chief Executive Officer of South China Morning Post, Ms Catherine So), Allan (Chairman and CEO of Lan Kwai Fong Group, Dr Allan Zeman), Bernard (Chairman of Our Hong Kong Foundation and Chairman of M+ Board, Mr Bernard Chan), distinguished guests, friends from South China Morning Post, ladies and gentlemen, 

I have great pleasure joining all of you this morning to share a few observations on redefining Hong Kong's culture, sports and tourism. As a start, I would like to share the exciting news that this year, Hong Kong has a rather successful first eight months tourism-wise. We welcomed over 33 million visitors thus far, which is a 12 per cent increase year on year. With this promising performance, I am quite confident that we will be able to achieve our target of receiving 49 million visitors by the end of 2025, a 10 per cent above last year; 5.15 million visitors in August alone, which is a 16 per cent growth year on year. This impressive performance is the collective effort of a lot of stakeholders and practitioners in the tourism and related sectors, many of whom are in the audience today. But indeed I should also thank every man and woman in the community who have so very kindly responded positively to my invitation on the first day of appointment as SCST to be a tourism ambassador. This, on its own, can be a powerful means to redefine Hong Kong. To all of you, please accept my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude!

For key stakeholders of the culture, sports and tourism fields that are with me this morning, I am sure you are all very much aware that during the past two years since we emerged from COVID and related social and travel restrictions, the travel patterns, preferences and behaviour of tourists worldwide have undergone significant changes. What has worked fine and easy before the pandemic is no longer the panacea in our effort to recover our ground as a premier travel destination. Shopping for luxurious items, for example, is now a much lower priority for at least a good portion of our tourists, especially the younger ones among them. In-its-stead, tourists these days look for immersive experiences, one-of-a-kind treatments, an escape from reality, or even just a dose of cuteness on-the-go.

So what is Hong Kong's response? Less than a month after I was appointed SCST on December 5 last year, building on the solid work of the Tourism Commission, I announced the Development Blueprint for Hong Kong's Tourism Industry 2.0 in end-December 2024. That Blueprint was meant to be a transformative roadmap for tourism. A four-pronged positioning for tourism development and four major development strategies were presented, alongside 133 specific measures designed to revive the glory of Hong Kong's tourism industry.

I believe most of you have heard me outline the four positioning, and four strategies in the Blueprint at least once and, sorry guys, if you have heard it numerous times already! Don't worry, this is not going to be another repetition of those. Actually I would like the facts, figures and customer reviews to speak for themselves, and to testify to the relevance and effectiveness of what was proposed in the Blueprint. At the heart of Blueprint 2.0 is a recognition of Hong Kong's unique cultural legacy, international outlook, natural beauty, and our proven ability to stage spectacular events with great efficiency and strong value-for-money. One of the key highlights of Blueprint 2.0 is to position culture and sports as cornerstones of our tourism strategy, so as to act out our policy of integrating culture, sports and tourism to create greater synergies and maximum value. To this end, we introduced the concept of ""Culture + Tourism"" and ""Sports + Tourism"" among other things.

Let me begin with Culture. I said in a recent interview with RTHK (Radio Television Hong Kong) that culture needs to be cultivated. Nurturing a one-of-a-kind cultural proposition for Hong Kong is the key if our policy of integrating culture and tourism is to succeed in this post-pandemic era when tourists all look for authentic experiences. Culture is not a backdrop, nor is it simply a means to drive economic development; it is the essence of our collective identity, and it shapes the content of our storytelling and our exchanges with visitors. By sharing compelling narratives of Hong Kong's unique and special cultural heritage, we can forge deeper connections with our valued visitors. Thanks to the tireless efforts of many devoted organisations and activities over the years, often with substantial government support, we can now comfortably call ourselves an East-meets-West cultural hub. From amazing performances of traditional Chinese Xiqu (operas) sung in different dialects to musicals with a taste of Guangdong and Hong Kong; from mesmerising modern dance dramas featuring Song-dynasty poets, classical literature masterpieces and Hong Kong comic favourites by local and mainland groups to traditional interpretations of French and Italian ballet and operas top quality visiting companies; to name but a few, these iconic and successful shows offered by the Hong Kong Arts Festival, the Chinese Culture Festival, and the West Kowloon Cultural District amply demonstrate the vibrancy, variety, international outlook, and strong Chinese cultural heritage that together shaped Hong Kong's cultural and art scene. On top of this, a great variety of important visual arts and pop culture events have also been staged in Hong Kong earlier this year with solid support from the Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund, including Art Basel Hong Kong 2025, Art Central 2025, ComplexCon Hong Kong 2025, and many more. All these created a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) for our Mainland and overseas friends, thereby inducing increased tourist inflow.

Now I would like to turn your focus to sports. Sports is much more than just engaging in competitions and achieving enviable physiques. It can be a powerhouse in drawing tourists. For anyone who fancies action and excitement, Hong Kong is your go-to city! Mega sports events are another integral piece shaping our tourism landscape. The Kai Tak Sports Park, the HK$30billion, biggest-ever sports infrastructure investment in Hong Kong's history, was commissioned officially in March this year, and has since elevated to the status of the Temple of Mega Sports Events after staging a series of eye-catching and breath-taking events. As a thriving hub for major international sports events, Hong Kong is committed to supporting and promoting large scale international sports events through the ""M"" Mark system. ""M"" Mark supports, among others, marketing and publicity channels to encourage greater participation from both locals and tourists, with an aim to foster a stronger sports culture while boosting our economy.

Over the past eight months, Hong Kong has successfully staged 16 ""M"" Mark events. In the last weekend of March this year, the Hong Kong Sevens, international Rugby Sevens, drew over 110 000 spectators during its three match days, marking a 13 per cent increase over the last edition in 2024. Of these, over 30 per cent (or more than 30 000) were non-locals, and I'm sure you have all seen for yourselves, either on site or on TV, just how ravelling the atmosphere and how international the crowd was, and for which many commentators rightfully drew the conclusion that Hong Kong Sevens is the best Sevens in the world in terms of atmosphere and excitement! How invaluable these images are in redefining what Hong Kong was like in the minds of at least some overseas.

Rugby Sevens aside, we cannot not mention football as a major tourist magnet. Earlier in May, 33 000 football fans filled Hong Kong Stadium to witness, I'm sad to say, a struggling Manchester United team winning their only trophy of the season after beating a handsomely performed Hong Kong, China team. Later in July, the Hong Kong Football Festival 2025 staged two matches at Kai Tak Stadium, featuring four top international football teams - Liverpool (FC), AC Milan, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. A total of close to 100 000 fans, at least 30 000 of them tourists, enjoyed themselves immensely while watching great football and cheering till losing their voice at the same time. Last but not the least, the Saudi Super Cup held just 10 days ago brought four top Saudi teams, and Cristiano Ronaldo amongst them, to Hong Kong and put some 80 000 fans in awe in both Hong Kong Stadium and Kai Tak Stadium.

These examples are indeed powerful illustrations of Hong Kong's increasingly sharpening edge as an events venue. With its world-class and state-of-the-art venues, the Kai Tak Sports Park now plays a pivotal role in our effort to elevate Hong Kong as Asia's events capital to a whole new level.

Of course, participants in sports are most excited and loyal when the teams and athletes they love play well. And in turn, this will inject more energy for players to go faster, stronger and further. My bureau is committed to propelling sports development through promoting sports in the community, supporting elite athletes, establishing Hong Kong as a hub for major international sports events, enhancing professionalism and developing sports as an industry. Despite the current financial climate, this financial year, we have earmarked an estimated $9.2 billion for sports - which is more than double the figure from a decade ago. The substantial investment underscores our dedication to cultivating a dynamic sports industry in Hong Kong. So my friends, watch this space for more events more ""World no.1s"" and more history-making performances, such as what Coleman Wong did at the U.S. Open, in the months and years to come.

I guess whenever I speak of mega events these days, I can't skip mega concerts held, where else, but at the Kai Tak Sports Park. Together with the football and rugby matches I mentioned just now, the concerts of Coldplay, Nicholas Tse, Mayday, JJ Lin, and G.E.M. have helped bring over 1 million spectators to the Kai Tak Sports Park since its opening six months ago today. The vibrancy and diverse offerings of Hong Kong as a one-stop destination for mega sports events, high quality cultural and arts performances, premier shopping and dining hub will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on visitors. All this will continue with hopefully the help of even greater contribution and effort from everyone, so that together we will foster stronger synergy, driving further economic development in our beloved city. Beyond ticket sales and event souvenirs, these events create extensive business and employment opportunities for various industries such as hotels, catering, retail, transportation, etc, giving a significant boost to the local economy. We will continue to work closely with all the stakeholders to develop the economic potential of the culture, sports and tourism industry to the fullest extent.

I am sure all of you would have felt that Hong Kong is experiencing a remarkable bloom in culture and sports tourism, and I surely await with great interest fellow speakers sharing their wisdom on how to make the most out of this promising trend.

In closing, I look forward to seeing all of you often at different events in different parts of Hong Kong, as organisers, sponsors, members of the audience, and last but certainly not the least, as Hong Kong's smiling tourism ambassadors.

Thank you very much. "

Dental Internship Programme for local dental graduates officially launched (with photos),2025-09-01 12:30,2025-09-01 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/01/P2025090100217.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (September 1) held a launch ceremony for the Dental Internship Programme to welcome the first cohort of 75 local dental graduates to join the department for a 12-month internship as Dental House Officers.

The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau; the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam; the Chairman of the Dental Council of Hong Kong (DCHK), Dr Lee Kin-man; and the Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Hong Kong, Professor Jin Lijian, offered encouragement to the Dental House Officers at the launch ceremony.

Addressing the ceremony, Professor Lo said, ""Today, we are gathered to witness the launch of Hong Kong's first Dental Internship Programme. This marks not only a significant milestone in Hong Kong's dental education but also a crucial step forward in our pursuit of higher-quality dental services. Dental practice is a highly specialised field of knowledge and skill, and excellent dentists must continuously refine their expertise through clinical practice. I hope that the Dental House Officers participating in this programme will cherish every opportunity to learn, honing their skills over the coming year. By engaging directly with patients, they can build mutual trust and develop empathy, embodying the professionalism of healthcare providers and safeguarding the health of Hong Kong's citizens. I am confident that the valuable hands-on experience gained during this internship will lay a solid foundation for the future careers of these aspiring dentists.""

Dr Lam said, ""Clinical internship is not only a vital process of acquiring techniques and knowledge, but also a crucial stage for developing your problem-solving abilities and enhancing your communication skills with patients. Embrace each challenge with a positive attitude and foster a strong teamwork spirit. Dentistry is a team-based discipline. Teamwork is key to providing high-quality healthcare services. Through mutual support and knowledge sharing, you will be equipped to more effectively address complex cases and elevate the overall standard of healthcare.""

Provisions relating to provisional registrations, internship and period of assessment in the Dentists Registration Ordinance (DRO) (Cap. 156) came into effect on April 1, 2025. Under the new arrangements, local dental graduates are required to undergo an internship, while non-locally trained dentists who have passed the licensing examination of the DCHK will need to undergo a period of assessment before obtaining full registration in Hong Kong.

The introduction of the internship and period of assessment under the DRO aims to strengthen the clinical experience of local dental graduates and non-locally trained dentists in real-life settings. Through this, they will become familiar with the dental practice in Hong Kong and hone their communication skills with local patients. This ensures that, in addition to mastering professional knowledge, they also develop sound practical skills and a professional attitude, enabling them to exercise clinical judgments in different situations and meet the demands of the dental practice effectively. The current year's local dental graduates have been granted provisional registration by the DCHK and appointed as Dental House Officers by the DH under contractual terms. The DH will first provide a two-week orientation programme for them to understand the scope of public dental services, and help them adapt promptly to the working environment and acquire service requirements and clinical techniques. They will then be assigned to rotate across various service units, including the DH, the Hospital Authority, and Prince Philip Dental Hospital, and work under the guidance of experienced dentists in the following areas:


general dental service;
emergency dental service;
hospital dental service(such as specialist services of oral maxillofacial surgery);
School Dental Care Service; and
community dental service(such as dental services designated for the underprivileged).


Upon successful completion of the internship, the Dental House Officers will be awarded a certificate of experience that enables them to obtain full registration."
