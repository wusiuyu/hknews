合作協議在行政長官李家超、中國人民銀行副行長鄒瀾、上海市委常委、常務副市長吳偉，以及上海市委金融委員會辦公室常務副主任周小全見證下，由財庫局局長許正宇與上海黃金交易所理事長余文建簽署。

許正宇並在簽署儀式上闡述合作協議的戰略意義和香港黃金市場的整體發展藍圖。他說：「黃金作為全球金融體系的基石之一，其獨特的物理屬性、稀缺性和避險功能，使其在各國儲備及資產多元配置中不可或缺。在地緣政治不確定性加劇、通脹壓力持續，以及國際貨幣體系重構的背景下，黃金的戰略重要性更為突顯。財庫局與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，體現我們堅定落實中央金融工作會議精神，推進高質量金融開放，促進香港與上海作為國際金融中心及黃金市場的協同發展。」

這份別具意義的合作協議重點包括兩項前瞻性安排：一是建立香港黃金中央結算系統的高層次協作治理架構。特區政府全資擁有的「香港貴金屬中央結算系統有限公司」（「港金結算公司」）董事會將由財庫局局長擔任主席，上海黃金交易所代表出任副主席。上海黃金交易所代表將在公司董事會中具體參與香港黃金中央清算系統準備、規則制定和機構認可等事宜，並就系統建設及風險管理等提供專業意見。滬港將攜手推動結算平台高效建設，並與國際接軌。

二是開拓實物基礎設施協同及市場互聯互通新路徑。雙方將探索依託上海黃金交易所實物倉儲管理體系，為香港本地及海內外市場參與者的黃金業務提供實物存儲服務，並在此基礎上帶動場內外業務的互聯互通。同時，雙方將積極推進兩地黃金市場更大程度的互聯互通，探索通過「港金結算公司」及香港黃金交易生態圈的重要參與者，為兩地投資者參與市場提供業務便利與技術支援，構建真正一體化、高效開放的黃金生態圈。

許正宇也進一步闡述政府對香港黃金市場發展的整體願景及配套措施，包括：

1. 推動香港機場管理局（機管局）及金融機構在港拓展黃金倉儲容量，以三年超越2 000噸為目標，使香港成為全球信賴的黃金儲存地。機管局已立項擴展在機場的倉儲設施，規模將達至千噸級別，兼顧本地儲存、交割和過境轉運需求；

2.財庫局已與深圳市地方金融管理局就港深兩地開展加工貿易合作簽署合作備忘錄，歡迎香港金商與深圳具備相關資格的精煉企業開展實質合作；

3.由政府全資擁有的公司所管理的香港黃金中央清算系統計劃於今年內試營運；

4. 政府計劃於今年上半年提交立法建議，把貴金屬納入有關基金及單一家族辦公室的優惠稅制合資格投資範圍；

5.本星期，香港將有一支全新的黃金基金上市，主要特色除了包括透過香港本地完善的黃金基礎設施，進行所有實金交易及黃金儲存，提供於銀行兌換實物黃金的選項，還計劃推出非上市類別，探索透過持牌數字資產交易平台分銷，連接傳統與數碼金融；和

6.市場機構在亞洲金融論壇的黃金專題環節上公布香港可持續黃金治理框架和標準體系建設展望，以推動合乎道德及可持續的採購、環境保護及長期責任標準。

許正宇強調：「我們與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，開啓香港與上海攜手塑造全球黃金市場未來的新篇章。我們將把握歷史機遇，搭建更堅固橋樑，激發創新，為全球投資者及經濟體創造持久價值。」"
FSTB and Shanghai Gold Exchange sign co-operation agreement to foster high-quality development of Hong Kong's gold market,2026-01-26 10:10,2026-01-26 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600175.htm,"The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) signed today (January 26) a co-operation agreement with the Shanghai Gold Exchange during the Asian Financial Forum, marking a new milestone in deepening co-operation between the gold markets of Hong Kong and Shanghai. The FSTB also revealed new moves in six aspects relating to the development of gold market at the same time.

The agreement was signed by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (SFST), Mr Christopher Hui, and the Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Mr Yu Wenjian, in the presence of the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee; the Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr Zou Lan; Member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei; and the Executive Deputy Director of the Office of the Financial Commission of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Mr Zhou Xiaoquan.

Mr Hui also outlined the strategic significance of the agreement and the overall development blueprint for Hong Kong's gold market at the signing ceremony. He said, ""Gold has long been regarded as a cornerstone of the global financial system. Its unique physical attributes, inherent scarcity, and proven safe-haven function make it irreplaceable in areas such as national reserves, asset allocation and diversification. In recent years, amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and ongoing restructuring of the international monetary system, the strategic importance of gold has become even more pronounced. The agreement signed by the FSTB and Shanghai Gold Exchange represents a resolute commitment to translating the spirit of the Central Financial Work Conference, advancing quality financial opening into concrete action while fostering synergistic development of Hong Kong and Shanghai as premier international financial and gold markets.""

This significant agreement covers two major forward-looking areas of co-operation:

1. Establishing a high-level, collaborative governance structure for Hong Kong's new gold central clearing system. The Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Company Limited, which is wholly owned by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, will have its Board chaired by the SFST while a representative from the Shanghai Gold Exchange will serve as Deputy Chairman. The representative of the Shanghai Gold Exchange will actively participate in the Board, contributing to the preparation of the system, the formulation of rules, the admission of participating institutions, and the provision of expert advice on system design, risk management and other areas. Shanghai and Hong Kong will work together to promote the efficient development of the clearing system and its alignment with international standards.

2. Opening new avenues for physical infrastructure synergy and market interconnectivity. The two sides will explore leveraging the Shanghai Gold Exchange's well-established physical warehousing management regime to provide secure gold management services for participants in both Hong Kong and international markets. The two sides aim to drive greater connectivity between on-exchange and off-exchange gold trading activities. The two sides will forge ahead broader mutual market access by exploring the provision of business convenience and technical alignment to investors from two places through the Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Company Limited and key participants in the emerging Hong Kong gold trading ecosystem, thereby creating a truly integrated, efficient and open ecosystem.

Mr Hui further elaborated on the Government's vision and supporting measures for Hong Kong's gold market development. They are:

1. Supporting the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) and financial institutions in establishing gold storage facilities, with a target to exceed 2,000 tonnes of storage capacity within three years, making Hong Kong a trusted global vault. The AAHK has launched a project to expand warehousing to a thousand-tonne scale, catering to local storage, delivery and transit requirements.

2. The FSTB has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau, laying the foundation for processing trade co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The next step is to welcome Hong Kong gold traders to engage in substantive co-operation with qualified Shenzhen refining enterprises.

3. Hong Kong's government-owned central clearing system for gold is on track to begin trial operations this year.

4. For the preferential tax regimes offered to funds and single family offices, the Government will propose including precious metals as qualifying investments. The target is to introduce the legislative proposal in the first half of this year.

5. This week, a new gold fund will list in Hong Kong. Its key features include leveraging Hong Kong's well-established gold infrastructure for physical gold trading and storage, with the option of physical gold redemption at bank. Also, the issuer plans to introduce an unlisted share class for potential distribution through licensed digital asset exchanges, bridging traditional and digital finance.

6. The release of an outlook by market participants on the development of Hong Kong's sustainable gold governance framework and standards at the gold-themed session of the Asian Financial Forum, with a view to fostering sustainable sourcing, environmental protection, and long-term responsibility standards.

Mr Hui stressed, ""The signing of this agreement with the Shanghai Gold Exchange marks the dawn of a new chapter—one in which Hong Kong and Shanghai join forces to shape the future of global gold markets. Let us embrace this historic opportunity to build stronger bridges, ignite innovation and create enduring value for investors and economies alike."""

The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said, ""I am happy to see the outstanding results achieved by InvestHK last year. Together with record numbers of Mainland and overseas companies and start-ups in the city, there are a clear reflection of the strong global investor confidence in Hong Kong. Our city's unique advantages, such as enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle, proactively integrating into the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and capitalising on national strategies such as the high-quality co-operation under the Belt and Road Initiative, continue to make it an important hub for businesses and investments, attracting enterprises across the globe to select the city as their base to expand regional businesses in Asia. This year marks the commencement of the 15th Five-Year Plan; the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to create an even more conducive business environment, further promote Hong Kong's national opportunities and international advantages to attract FDI and companies to Hong Kong, demonstrating the city's roles as a 'super-connector' and a 'super value-adder'.""

Record high numbers of companies and start-ups affirm Hong Kong's incomparable business advantages,2026-01-26 09:26,2026-01-26 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600135.htm," According to the results of the 2025 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located outside Hong Kong and the 2025 Startup Survey announced by the Government today (January 26), the number of companies in Hong Kong with Chinese Mainland or overseas parent companies rose to 11 070 in 2025, while the number of start-ups in Hong Kong increased to 5 221, both reaching record highs again. The results demonstrate that Hong Kong's unique attractiveness to enterprises from around the globe continues to rise, and that the city is the ideal investment destination to set up or expand businesses.

 The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said, ""Even though geopolitics and the global economic and trade landscape are evolving, Hong Kong has been proactively demonstrating its incomparably unique advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle, as the best two-way springboard for overseas enterprises to tap into the vast Chinese Mainland market and for Chinese Mainland enterprises to go global. Together with the wide array of the latest initiatives to promote economic development, including the establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global, the formulation of preferential policy packages to attract high value-added industries to Hong Kong, the accelerated development of the Northern Metropolis, the establishment of the Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, etc, Hong Kong's advantages will continue to strengthen, thereby accelerating the injection of new impetus to our economy and providing more opportunities for both Chinese Mainland and overseas companies based in Hong Kong.

 ""On another note, the number of start-ups in Hong Kong continues to grow at a double-digit percentage rate, signifying that the city is an ideal place for start-ups to thrive, and demonstrating the great confidence that global start-up entrepreneurs have in Hong Kong. Start-ups can leverage the strengths of Hong Kong - including its concentration of internationally renowned universities and research institutes, entrepreneurial talent, and investors from around the world, as well as a strong local network of incubators and accelerators, to rapidly develop innovation and technology businesses that showcase their strengths,"" Mr Yau added.

 The results of the above two local surveys fully display the confidence of Chinese Mainland and overseas companies in Hong Kong's future development. Also, Hong Kong recently received exceptional rankings in reports by various international institutes. For example, Hong Kong was again ranked by the Fraser Institute as the world's freest economy, and moved up to third place overall in foreign direct investment inflows in the World Investment Report 2025 released by the United Nations Trade and Development. Such recognition demonstrates the world's growing awareness of Hong Kong as an international hub for business and investment.

 According to the 2025 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located outside Hong Kong jointly conducted by Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) and the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), there were 11 070 companies in Hong Kong with parent companies located outside Hong Kong in 2025, representing an increase of 11 per cent, which amounted to 1 110 companies, when compared with 2024. The number of people employed reached 509 000, recording an increase of 3 per cent year on year.

 Analysed by the location of parent company, in 2025, the Chinese Mainland was ranked first (3 090), followed by the United States and Japan (both 1 550), the United Kingdom (770) and Singapore (590).

 Analysed by major line of business in Hong Kong, among those 11 070 companies, in 2025, the import/export trade, wholesale and retail sector topped the list (5 100), followed by the financing and banking sector (2 390), and the professional, business and education services sector (1 770).

 In addition, based on the results of InvestHK's 2025 Startup Survey, start-ups in Hong Kong continued to flourish with a record high number of 5 221, up 11 per cent year on year. These start-ups engaged 19 753 persons, representing an increase of 12 per cent year on year, spanned across different sectors, including financial technology; information, computer and technology; biotechnology; education and learning; and health and medical, etc.

 The results of the two surveys have been uploaded onto the websites of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110004&scode=360) and InvestHK (www.investhk.gov.hk/en/resource-centre/?type=brochures-and-guides-general) respectively."
駐港公司和初創企業數目再創新高反映香港無可比擬優勢,2026-01-26 09:26,2026-01-26 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600137.htm,"政府今日（一月二十六日）公布的「二零二五年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司按年統計調查」和「二零二五年初創企業統計調查」結果顯示，在二○二五年，母公司在內地及海外的駐港公司數目增加至11 070間，而香港的初創企業數目則增至5 221間。兩項數字均再創新高，顯示香港對全球企業的獨特吸引力持續增加，是它們設立或擴展業務的理想投資目的地。

商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺表示：「即使面對地緣政治和環球經貿格局的轉變，香港一直積極發揮在『一國兩制』下無可比擬的獨特優勢，是海外企業開拓內地龐大市場和內地企業出海的最佳雙向跳板。加上政府推出一系列促進經濟的政策措施，包括成立內地企業出海專班、制定優惠政策包吸引高增值產業落戶、加速發展北部都會區、開設駐吉隆坡經濟貿易辦事處等，將繼續增強香港的優勢，加速為經濟注入新動力，為駐港海內外企業帶來更多機遇。」

他續說：「另一方面，香港的初創企業數目持續錄得雙位數字的百分比增長，足證香港是初創企業落戶的理想地點和環球初創企業家對香港的強大信心。初創企業可善用香港的優勢，包括匯聚國際一流的大學及科研機構、具創業精神的人才、來自全球的投資者、以及本地強大的孵化器及加速器網絡等，快速發展創科業務，一展所長。」

上述的本地調查結果充分證明海內外企業對香港前景充滿信心，而香港近期亦在多份國際機構報告中名列前茅，包括再次獲菲沙研究所評定為全球最自由經濟體，以及在聯合國貿易和發展發布的《2025年世界投資報告》中，於外來直接投資流入方面總體排名上升至第三位，印證香港作為世界公認的國際商業和投資樞紐。

根據投資推廣署及政府統計處共同進行的「二零二五年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司按年統計調查」，二○二五年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司數目達11 070間，較二○二四年增加1 110間，上升11%；而僱用人數高達509 000人，按年上升3%。

按母公司所在地分析，在二○二五年，內地駐港公司數目最多（3 090間），其次是美國和日本（均為1 550間）、英國（770間）及新加坡（590間）。

該11 070間駐港公司中，按在香港的主要業務範圍分析，在二○二五年從事進出口貿易、批發及零售業的駐港公司數目最多（5 100間），其次是金融及銀行業（2 390間），以及專業、商用及教育服務業（1 770間）。

此外，投資推廣署進行的「二零二五年初創企業統計調查」結果顯示，香港的初創企業持續蓬勃發展，二○二五年的數目按年增加11%至5 221間，再創歷史新高，共僱用19 753人，按年增加12%。這些初創企業涵蓋不同行業，包括金融科技；資訊、電腦及科技；生物科技；教育及學習；以及健康及醫療等。

兩項調查結果已分別上載至政府統計處（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110004&scode=360）及投資推廣署（www.investhk.gov.hk/zh-hk/resource-centre/?type=投資推廣署小冊子-general）網頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-25 17:30,2026-01-25 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/25/P2026012500485.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 25), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。
