基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-01 17:30,2025-10-01 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/01/P2025100100567.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得23宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至八月，全球16個國家／地區呈報了約31萬7千宗基孔肯雅熱病例及135宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-01 17:30,2025-10-01 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/01/P2025100100563.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 1), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 23 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

政務司司長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-01 14:24,2025-10-01 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/01/P2025100100432.htm,"   以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十月一日）中午會見傳媒的談話內容：

政務司司長：今日是國慶，首先祝大家國慶快樂。一連八日——大家都知道是內地國慶加上中秋長假期，已正式展開。

  其實，我們在九月中已召開跨部門會議（節慶安排跨部門工作小組會議），商討統籌不同部門在各個方面，包括口岸通關、公共交通、人流管制、旅客保障、信息發放等安排，如何可以令旅客來到香港有一個好的體驗，這很重要，亦令他們不會受到交通等其他的影響。

  今日早上，我出席了國慶升旗儀式後，來到西貢北潭涌和萬宜水庫東壩一帶。大家都見到有保安局局長鄧炳強、環境局（環境及生態局）局長謝展寰、保安局副局長、物流局（運輸及物流局）副局長，以及運輸署、警方和漁護署的代表都在此，我們今日一起看這裡的情況如何。東壩是一個很受香港市民和內地遊客歡迎的景點，因為這是一個世界級景點，所以這裡是非常重要。

  我們要看各項安排的情況如何。直到目前為止，大約有一千名旅客到此。交通安排較平時增加了，例如平時進來這裡的專線小巴有四輛，今日增加至三十輛，另外還有十輛在準備，有需要時他們可以加進來運作。另外，今日旅客雖然多，一早已經有一千名旅客進來，但是大部分都是車等人，所以秩序是相當好。

  警方同事在這裡除了「打交通」外，亦會控制人群，目標有幾個，第一，希望旅客有秩序；第二，交通不會受到阻塞；第三，希望他們享受這裡的好景色，亦都是安全，這很重要。因為這裡比較空曠，如果天氣很炎熱，我有少許擔心有些旅客可能體質未做好準備，可能會有危險，所以今日民安隊亦在此開設支援站，希望能夠支援有需要的旅客，這亦很重要。

  除此之外，我們有不同改善措施，例如增加這裡的WIFI訊號，內地朋友很多時習慣使用電子支付方式，如果沒有WIFI、沒有訊號，可能會無法使用，我們會加強這方面，希望可以方便到他們。

  另外，警方在此設立指揮中心，聯同運輸署一起在此監察。除了用鏡頭監察外，亦會使用無人機輔助監察，希望能夠監察到整體運作情況。我相信在這方面的目的只有一個，就是希望能夠確保旅客能夠安全和有秩序。

  我很多謝各個政府部門、小巴營運商、警務人員和其他前線工作人員，齊心協力為旅客提供優質的體驗。我亦很感謝旅客在這方面的配合。今日整體的安排我是非常滿意的，亦都再次呼籲：各位香港市民、各位旅客，國慶假期有很多優惠，希望大家可以盡情享受香港的所有優惠。

記者：司長，之前刹停了禁止的士駛入東壩的禁令，在觀察完今日的情況後，你覺得再推（禁令）的機會有多大？另外，東壩一直有很多的人流，當局會如何在環境保育和生態旅遊之間做好平衡？擔不擔心其實東壩負荷不了這麼大的人流？

政務司司長：其實在旅客方面，我聽到同事的報告，旅客對於環境保護方面是做得很好的，並未有對環境造成很大的破壞。正如我剛才所說，我要多謝旅客的配合。因為只要大家不亂拋垃圾、不要污染海水、不要破壞（環境），其實大家現在做得很好，我看不到有很大的破壞，我們是可以承受這個旅客的數字。

  當然，交通也是一個問題。我剛才看到，大家剛進來也看到，有很多段路也是單線雙程行車，也即是說很多時候也會有「對頭車」的出現，這是很不理想的。我回去會和警方研究，怎樣可以改善這個情況。其實早前我們考慮怎樣去規範的士進入的情況，目的也是為了交通暢順，令他們做生意也快點，大家堵着在這裏也沒有意思。如果大家堵着在這裏幾個小時也動不了，這個情況絕對不理想。所以我希望能夠和警方商量出一個方法，可以令到交通既順暢又安全，這樣對大家都好。

記者：司長，剛剛進來的時候觀察到，進出的時候會先不讓車輛進入，讓裏面的車輛先離開，才讓外面的車輛進入。我們問過外面的司機，他覺得這個方法不太好，有些擾民，因為司機也懂得自己讓車，現在就塞住了。乘客也反映現在要等待很久，覺得不是太好。這個方法是否今次才用？可以如何檢討？

政務司司長：正如剛才所說，鑑於地理環境的情況，很多道路都是單線雙程行車，這並不理想。你說有司機懂讓車，但未必每位司機也懂讓車，容易發生危險，因為「對頭車」是十分不理想的。所以今日來說，警方用了「打交通」的方法：一方先行駛，然後到另外一方。這既有效率，也能令大家都安全。安全和暢順是我們首先要考慮的。當然也有等待的時候，其實和等待交通燈一樣，也是有部分車輛要等一等，其他車先行駛，我希望司機們能配合。我今天目測，所有車等十多分鐘就可以通過。我們以往也有經驗，當兩部車輛「卡住」，雙方都行駛不了，「塞死」，這是最不理想的，我也不想看到它發生。剛才所見，很多道路的確很難改道，所以我要和警方討論如何可以長遠地解決這個問題。這些問題主要集中在大時大節，在其他的「閒日」，這裏的交通不是問題。因此希望大家能理解，我們要「打交通」、指揮交通也是為了大家的安全和暢順。"
政府批出安裝自動泊車系統的慈雲山停車場短期租約用地,2025-10-01 14:00,2025-10-01 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/01/P2025093000281.htm,"政府今日（十月一日）宣布，一幅位於慈雲山樂華街的政府短期租約用地（短期租約第STTKE0056號）以月租266,999元，批予Keyman One Development Limited，用作收費公眾停車場並安裝自動泊車系統，是政府短期租約用地的第五個自動泊車系統項目。租約期先定為五年，其後可每半年續租。

根據租約條款，承租者須架設、興建及安裝拼圖型自動泊車系統，在不少於189個車位中，提供不少於39個自動泊車系統車位，目標於二○二七年啓用。

運輸署發言人表示，採用自動泊車系統能更有效地善用空間、提高泊車效率，有助紓緩公眾對泊車位的需求。首三個位於荃灣海盛路、大埔白石角及深水埗通州街的自動泊車系統項目已投入服務，合共提供約180個自動化泊位。政府會繼續積極在合適的短期租約停車場推展自動泊車系統項目。"
Government awards short-term tenancy in Tsz Wan Shan for parking site with installation of automated parking system,2025-10-01 14:00,2025-10-01 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/01/P2025093000283.htm,"  The Government announced today (October 1) that a short-term tenancy (STT) of one lot of government land at Lok Wah Street in Tsz Wan Shan (STT No. STTKE0056) to be used as a fee-paying public car park, with the installation of an automated parking system (APS), has been awarded to Keyman One Development Limited at a monthly rental of $266,999. This is the fifth APS project at a government STT site. The term of the STT is five years certain and thereafter half-yearly.

 Under the STT, the tenant is required to erect, construct and install an APS in the form of a puzzle stacking system, providing not less than 39 automated parking spaces out of a total minimum of 189 parking spaces, with a view to commissioning in 2027.

 A spokesman for the Transport Department said that the application of APS can utilise space more effectively and increase parking efficiency, alleviating the public demand for parking spaces. The first three APS projects at Hoi Shing Road in Tsuen Wan, Pak Shek Kok in Tai Po and Tung Chau Street in Sham Shui Po have already commenced services, providing about 180 automated parking spaces in total. The Government will continue to actively take forward APS projects in suitable STT car parks."

Apart from patrolling popular shopping areas, Customs officers will also promote compliance at dried seafood and ginseng shops, pharmacies, jewellery shops and hawker pitches in different tourist shopping areas such as Yau Tsim Mong and Causeway Bay. Traders and workers in the tourist industry will be reminded to comply with the requirements of the TDO.

Customs officers will also distribute pamphlets at land boundary control points and popular shopping spots to remind visitors to have a good understanding of a product's specifications and make comparisons before purchasing. They should patronise shops with good reputations. They are also reminded to carefully check the total price and unit price of goods before making payment and to retain transaction receipts and related records, which can serve as supporting documents in case a complaint is lodged in the future. They are additionally reminded to check with the trademark owners or their authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt.

Customs has long been concerned about visitors being misled into making purchases through unfair trade practices and has established a Quick Response Team to handle urgent complaints lodged by short-haul visitors. The complaints will be promptly referred to investigators for priority handling.

Under the TDO, any trader who adopts unfair trade practices, including making false trade descriptions in relation to goods, misleading omissions, aggressive commercial practices as well as bait and switch practices, commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report suspected violations of the TDO to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080, or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Distinguished guests, fellow citizens,

  I am delighted to celebrate with all of you here today the 76th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This year marks the conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan period, the preparatory year for the 15th Five-Year Plan and also the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, a milestone prompting us to remember the past and create a better future together.

  Looking back over the past three-quarters of a century, the Chinese nation has gone through an extraordinary journey. With the arduous struggles from victory in the war of resistance to the beginning of the founding of the country, and the rapid economic growth from the country's reform and opening-up to a new era of high-quality development, the Chinese nation has achieved a tremendous transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong. Today, our country has secured its status as the world's second-largest economy and has become the world's largest manufacturer and merchandise trader. With powerful national strengths, our country has garnered global attention with its achievements and wielded significant international influence.

  On September 3, I led a delegation of over 300 members from different sectors of the community to Beijing to attend the commemorative rally and military parade marking the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance. We witnessed our country's commemoration of victory, remembrance of history and the tribute paid to fallen heroes in the most solemn and respectful way. For this, I felt deeply exhilarated, honoured and proud. This was a military parade since our country had forged ahead on the new journey through the Chinese path to modernisation, a vivid portrayal of the country's great capabilities in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests as well as world peace. Prior to the commemorative rally, President Xi Jinping warmly shook hands with six veterans, including 94-year-old Mr Lo King-fai, a Hong Kong veteran of the Dongjiang Column, at the viewing stand of the Tiananmen Tower, indicating clearly that the Central Authorities attach great importance to and care for Hong Kong.

  To commemorate the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has organised a series of activities. As entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council and the Central Military Commission, I have had the honour to present commemorative medals to the surviving veteran soldiers, veteran heroes, resistance commanders or their descendants in Hong Kong. I have attended large-scale roving exhibitions, officiated a ceremony at Tsam Chuk Wan Martyrs Memorial Garden and the unveiling ceremony of the couplet at the memorial pavilion for martyrs, and visited the ""Commemorating the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance in Guangdong and Hong Kong"" exhibition at the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence. In my Policy Address delivered last month, I have also stated that we will comprehensively review and conduct restoration and protection work on historic sites relating to the participation of the Communist Party of China in the War of Resistance in various districts, with a view to integrating them into tourism routes and educational activities. This will serve to enhance public understanding of the history of the War of Resistance in Hong Kong.

  Our country remains committed to opening up and pursuing high-quality development, offering Chinese wisdom for the reform of the global governance system and demonstrating its responsibility as a major power. Proactively aligning with national development strategies and leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages under ""one country, two systems"", the Government will spare no efforts in three aspects:

  First, to fully co-ordinate security and development in a bid to ensure high-quality development with high-level security.

  Safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests is the highest principle of ""one country, two systems"". The Government is committed to continuously enhancing the legal system and enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security to ensure security and promote development, striving for a vibrant economy, pursuing development and advancing infrastructure construction.

  We will devote all efforts in preparing for the upcoming general election for the eighth-term Legislative Council on December7 this year, ensuring that the election is conducted in a fair, just, honest, safe and orderly manner.

  Second, to facilitate economic growth and improve people's livelihood.

  My ultimate objective in governance is to improve people's livelihood. The economy and people's livelihood complement and reinforce each other: economic growth is the bedrock of livelihood improvement for it creates job opportunities and wealth, and livelihood improvement will in turn spark new social demands that stimulate market development, further promoting economic growth.

  The dividends of economic development and livelihood improvement are interconnected and generate synergy effects. Economic development could lead to the creation of more high-quality jobs and drive wages up, while a vibrant economy could boost government revenues and enable the Government to provide additional infrastructure as well as services. In this interplay process, some sectors like finance and trading can enjoy the dividends more promptly, while some other sectors may share the dividends in a more indirect way. Nevertheless, these dividends will eventually be shared by the whole community, with every one of us enjoying the fruits of development as well evidenced by the increase of median household income by 11 per cent over the past three years. The Government strives to adopt effective measures to eliminate bottlenecks in the generation of dividends and shorten the time needed to realise efficiency gains, in order that citizens can benefit from the fruits of economic development more quickly and extensively.

  Third, to put into practice the policies and principles outlined in the Policy Address, deepening reforms for our people and leveraging our strengths for a brighter future.

  I attach great importance to swiftly resolving livelihood issues, as well as setting out long-term planning and systematic layout. Over the past three years or so, I have been actively promoting reforms, both within the Government and in the wider community, and various polices have been implemented. They are gradually delivering results. We have seen not only increases in people's income and the hustle and bustle of a thriving economy, but also consistent improvements in our performance in international ratings.

  Hong Kong's ranking as a global financial centre moved up one place last year, and we have since become the third-ranked global financial centre. Hong Kong has climbed four spots to rank third globally in overall competitiveness. We have risen 12 places to the fourth globally in talent competitiveness over the past two years, and are ranked seventh among the world's top ten safest cities. More than testifying that our governance is on the right track and showing the united efforts of the Government and the people of Hong Kong, these objective rankings are testament to the promising economic outlook and confidence of the international community in Hong Kong, as well as our strong vibrancy under ""one country, two systems"".

  An ancient Chinese poem goes: ""With high tide and tailwind, it is time to sail a smooth ride."" Amid accelerating global changes unseen in a century and rapid changes arising from fast scientific advancement, we are moving through an irreversible economic transition, an essential process for a more robust economy in the future. Hong Kong is at the critical juncture of advancing from stability to prosperity. I am confident that by working together, innovating and embracing reforms, we will turn our beloved Hong Kong into an even better home for everyone. The Pearl of the Orient will keep shining brighter than ever before.

  I wish prosperity and stability for our motherland and Hong Kong. May all of you enjoy good health and achieve success in every endeavour. Thank you very much."

Hong Kong is at the critical juncture of advancing from stability to prosperity. I am confident that by working together, innovating and embracing reforms, we will turn our beloved Hong Kong into an even better home for everyone. The Pearl of the Orient will keep shining brighter than ever before.

  I wish prosperity and stability for our motherland and Hong Kong. May all of you enjoy good health and achieve success in every endeavour. Thank you very much."
行政長官國慶酒會致辭（附短片）,2025-10-01 09:30,2025-10-01 10:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/01/P2025100100221.htm,"​以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月一日）出席中華人民共和國成立七十六周年國慶酒會致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位市民：

今天我很高興與大家聚首一堂，慶祝中華人民共和國成立七十六周年的大日子。今年是「十四五」規劃的收官之年、是「十五五」規劃的謀篇布局之年，亦是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利八十周年，提醒我們既要銘記歷史，更要展望未來。

回望過去四分之三個世紀，中華民族走過了極不平凡的征程。從抗戰勝利到建國初期的艱辛奮鬥，從改革開放邁向新時代高質量發展的經濟騰飛，中華民族實現了從站起來、富起來到強起來的偉大飛躍。如今，國家穩居世界第二大經濟體，是製造業第一大國、貨物貿易第一大國，國力強大，成就舉世矚目，國際影響力舉足輕重。

上月三日，我率領300多位由香港各界人士組成的代表團，到北京參加抗戰勝利八十周年紀念大會和閱兵典禮，見證我們國家以最莊嚴和自信的方式紀念勝利、銘記歷史、緬懷先烈。我深感振奮、光榮和自豪。這次閱兵是全面推進中國式現代化進入新征程的一次閱兵，充分彰顯國家在捍衛主權、安全、發展利益，以及維護世界和平的強大能力。在紀念大會開始前，習近平主席在天安門城樓觀禮席和六位抗戰老戰士親切握手，當中包括來自香港、現年94歲的東江縱隊老戰士羅競輝先生，充分彰顯中央對香港的高度重視和親切關懷。

為紀念抗戰勝利八十周年，香港特區舉辦了系列活動。我很光榮受中共中央、國務院和中央軍委委託，向在港曾參加抗戰的老戰士、老英雄，抗戰將領或其遺屬頒發紀念章。我分別出席了大型巡迴展覽、主持斬竹灣抗日英烈紀念碑園典禮，為英烈紀念亭的對聯揭幕，以及到香港抗戰及海防博物館參觀粵港人民抗戰勝利八十周年展。我上月發表的《施政報告》中亦提出，我們會全面梳理及修繕保護各區的中共抗戰遺址，融入體驗路線和教育活動，以加深市民對香港抗戰歷史的認識。

國家堅持對外開放，全面推動高質量發展，在全球治理體系變革中貢獻中國智慧，展現大國擔當。特區政府會主動對接國家發展戰略，發揮「一國兩制」下香港的獨特優勢，着力做好三方面的工作：

第一，統籌好安全和發展，以高水平安全護航高質量發展。

維護國家主權、安全、發展利益是「一國兩制」的最高原則，政府會不斷完善維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制，維護安全和推動發展，全力拼經濟、謀發展、搞建設。

我們會全力辦好今年十二月七日舉行的第八屆立法會選舉，確保選舉公平、公正、誠實和安全有序進行。

第二，發展經濟，改善民生。

改善民生是我施政的最終目標。經濟與民生相輔相成：經濟增長是改善民生的基石，能夠創造就業和財富；民生改善則帶動社會需求，激發市場活力，進一步促進經濟發展。

經濟發展和民生改善的紅利相互連結，有聯動效應。發展經濟帶來更多優質職位，帶動工資上升；經濟蓬勃會增加財政收入，讓政府建設更多基建、提供更多服務。在這聯動關係中，部分行業如金融、貿易等會較快獲得紅利，一些行業則可能較間接受益，但紅利最終會遍及整個社會，讓大家共享發展成果。這一點可從家庭收入中位數在三年間上升了11%體現出來。政府會透過政策大力疏通紅利轉化的樽頸，縮短效益實現的時間，讓市民更快、更多地受益於經濟發展成果。

第三，落實好《施政報告》的政策和理念，深化改革、心繫民生、發揮優勢、同創未來。

我重視即時措施解決市民日常問題，同時重視長遠規劃和系統布局。三年多以來，我積極推動政府與社會改革求進，各政策不斷落實，陸續見到成果。除了市民收入增加、市面不時出現車水馬龍的現象外，國際評級亦不斷上升。

香港金融中心地位上升一位，連續兩年全球第三，香港整體競爭力上升四位至世界第三，人才競爭力兩年間躍升十二位至全球第四，安全城市排名躋身十大至世界第七。這些客觀評級不但反映政府施政方向正確，以及政府和市民的共同努力，更反映香港經濟前景光明和國際的信心，彰顯香港在「一國兩制」下的強大生命力。

「潮平兩岸闊，風正一帆懸」。世界百年未有之大變局加速演進，科技急速發展帶來急速轉變，我們處於不可逆轉的經濟轉型期，是邁向經濟更強大的必經過程。香港正站在邁向「由治及興」的關鍵節點。我深信，只要我們團結一致，改革創新，我們的共同家園——香港必定更美好，東方之珠更耀目光芒。

我祝願祖國富強昌盛，香港繁榮穩定；各位身體健康，事事順利。多謝大家。"

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-01 06:46,2025-10-01 07:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/01/P2025100100155.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 1) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."
天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-10-01 06:46,2025-10-01 07:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/01/P2025100100154.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月一日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。

Labour Department highly concerned about fatal work accident that happened in Tai Po today,2025-09-30 23:52,2025-10-01 00:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/30/P2025093000966.htm,"  âThe Labour Department (LD) is highly concerned about a fatal work accident that happened at a construction site in Tai Po this afternoon (September 30), in which a female worker was trapped between a mobile crane and a metal railing nearby.She was certified dead later in hospital. The LD is saddened by the death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to her family.

The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending the use of the mobile crane involved. The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the relevant duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

 To prevent workers from being struck or trapped by moving or slewing mobile appliance, the LD reminds owners of such appliance to ensure that (i) an unobstructed passageway, not less than 600 millimetres wide, is maintained between the appliance and any nearby railing or fixture; (ii) a safe distance is maintained between the appliance and workers nearby. Otherwise, all reasonable steps shall be taken to prevent any worker from entering the operation zone of the mobile appliance.

The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

In regard to today's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."
DH responds to media enquiries regarding Vaccination Subsidy Scheme consent forms,2025-09-30 23:10,2025-09-30 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/30/P2025093000962.htm,"âIn response to media inquiries regarding online rumors alleging that the consent form for the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme (VSS) contains hidden details and that the physical condition of individuals receiving seasonal influenza vaccines might be included in organ donation matching or related research, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 30) vehemently denied such claims and provided the following response:

The allegations are completely unfounded. Members of the public should not be misled.

The 2025/26 Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (SIV) Programmes comprises four programmes, namely Government Vaccination Programme, Residential Care Home Vaccination Programme, Seasonal Influenza Vaccination School Outreach Programme and VSS. Eligible high-risk groups generally need to complete a consent form before receiving free or subsidised SIV through the programmes. The consent form specifies that the information provided may be transferred to private doctors, the Primary Healthcare Commission, the Hospital Authority, the Government's agents and 15 healthcare-related statutory Boards and Councils that the DH provides secretariat support to. In the past, the consent forms of the SIV Programmes also stated that the Government may, when necessary, provide personal data obtained to other organisations (including the aforementioned 15 healthcare-related statutory Boards and Council for which the DH provides secretariat support) for the purposes of personal data collection stated in the consent form. These provisions ensure that the DH can promptly and effectively investigate any rare adverse events that may occur during the SIV programmes, such as enabling the relevant bodies to investigate serious medical incidents involving vaccine recipients. The DH will never use the information for organ donation or research on donor-recipient matching. Both paper and electronic consent forms are generally destroyed within seven years. The DH does not retain the relevant personal data either. This practice fully complies with relevant laws and requirements for protecting personal data privacy.

The CHP urged the public not to hesitate about receiving SIV due to rumours. The CHP stressed that vaccination has been scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. It also reduces the risks of in-patient admission and mortality due to seasonal influenza. All members of the public aged six months or above, except those with known contraindications, should receive SIV every year for personal protection. As the saying goes, 'get vaccinated once a year and sooner is better than later'.

For more information on the government-subsidised SIV Programmes, please call the CHP at 2125 2125 or visit the website."

中心呼籲市民切勿因謠言而猶豫是否接種季節性流感疫苗。中心強調，根據科學實證，接種疫苗是預防季節性流感重症及其併發症的最有效方法之一，亦可減低入院留醫的機會和死亡的風險。除個別有已知禁忌症的人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上人士都適宜每年接種季節性流感疫苗，以保障個人健康。季節性流感疫苗「一年打一次，宜早不宜遲」。

About 13 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $2.8 million were seized.

A 20-year-old non-local male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During Customs clearance, the batch of suspected cannabis buds was found inside his check-in suitcase. The male was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court on October 2.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en)."
Working Group on Planning and Construction of the University Town under Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis holds first meeting (with photos),2025-09-30 21:36,2025-09-30 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/30/P2025093000732.htm,"âThe Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that he will lead the newly established Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis. Three working groups were set up under the Committee, including the Working Group on Planning and Construction of the University Town (WG) led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki. Following the first working meeting of the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis chaired by the Chief Executive yesterday (September 29), Mr Chan convened the WG’s first meeting today (September 30).

The meeting focused on discussing the overall development strategy and specific implementation plan for the Northern Metropolis University Town (NMUT). Members of the WG thoroughly discussed the preliminary planning directions of the NMUT’s Hung Shui Kiu site, which endeavours to integrate with nearby, high-end professional services as well as vocational and professional education and training facilities for joint development. The WG will set up a research taskforce later to conduct field trips on the successful models of university towns elsewhere, seeking views from experts and academics of local, Mainland, and internationally renowned universities, to ensure the planning is both forward-looking and practical.

Mr Chan emphasised at the meeting that the development of the NMUT will break away from traditional models, achieving synergistic and deeply integrated development between education and industry, holding immense strategic significance for Hong Kong's future growth. He pointed out that the University Town will not only provide development room for the post-secondary education sector to expand capacity and enhance quality, but will also serve as a key engine to advance the deeply integrated development of Hong Kong’s academic excellence and industry. It will also realise the promotion of industrial development through education.

Mr Chan said the WG will adopt innovative thinking to formulate specific suggestions for the Northern Metropolis University Town Development Conceptual Framework, the development model of the University Town, and concrete facilities. The WG will also proactively study the strategies for attracting leading universities and research institutes on the Mainland and overseas to establish a base in Hong Kong, to attract world-class scholars and outstanding students to Hong Kong, facilitating Hong Kong’s development into an international education hub.

The Government has earmarked a total of around 90 hectares of land for the NMUT in the Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area (HSK), Ngau Tam Mei New Development Area (NTM) and the New Territories North New Town (NTN NT) of the Northern Metropolis. The three batches of sites for the NMUT are at different planning and development phases, and will be available for use in 2026 (HSK), 2028 (NTM) and 2030 (NTN NT) respectively at the earliest.

The WG will later report the work plan and the plan for matters that can be advanced in the short term to the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis to ensure the effective advancement of the NMUT project.

The membership list of the WG is set out in the Annex."
CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as severe paediatric influenza A infection case was recorded over two consecutive days,2025-09-30 21:10,2025-09-30 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/30/P2025093000808.htm,"  Following yesterday's (September 29) announcement of a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 30) recorded another similar severe case. The CHP reiterates its appeal to schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The latest case involves a six-year-old girl with good past health. She developed a fever, a cough and running nosesince September 20. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital on September 26. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia. She remains hospitalised in the paediatric intensive care unit of the hospital and is in serious condition.

The CHP's investigations revealed that one of the girl's household contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms on September 21, who did not require hospitalisation after seeking medical attention.The girl had received the 2024/25 SIV. Four of her classmates recently developed mild influenza-like symptoms between September 28 and 29. None of them required hospitalisation. No outbreaks have been reported in other classes at her school so far. The CHP advised the school on the necessary infection control measures to be implemented and will continue to put the school under medical surveillance.

  ""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illnessoutbreaks in schools since September. As of September 29, 232 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 22 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 123 cases in primary schools and 87 cases in secondary schools. Nine severe paediatric influenza cases involving children aged 3 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year. Seven of them had good past health,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The 2025/26 SIV Programmes have commenced, offering free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. This year, all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools are allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities.

  ""Currently around 2 300 schools (99 per cent) are going to arrange the SIV school outreach activities, with about 1 300 schools (58 per cent) scheduled to conduct outreach activities by the end of October. Some schools have already completed their outreach activities. For schools that will not arrange SIV outreach activities, the school list will be uploaded onto the CHP's website to enable parents of the students in those schools to arrange SIV for their children. I urge all schools to arrange outreach activities as soon as possible. Parents should not hesitate. As the saying goes, 'get vaccinated once a year and sooner is better than later'. Parents should arrange for their children to receive SIV as soon as possible to effectively prevent influenza and reduce the risk of serious illness or death from infection,"" Dr Tsui said.

The Government has opened all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the 25 District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission, and 74 general outpatient clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system.

Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

Results of 2025 BIS Triennial Survey of Foreign Exchange and OTC Derivatives Markets Turnover,2025-09-30 21:05,2025-09-30 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/30/P2025093000530.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published today (September 30) the results of the 2025 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Over-the-counter (OTC) Derivatives Markets Turnover (Note).

According to the survey results, Hong Kong remained the fourth largest global foreign exchange centre and the top global offshore Renminbi business hub.

The average daily turnover of foreign exchange transactions in Hong Kong increased by 27.2% to US$883.1 billion in April 2025 from US$694.4 billion in April 2022. The growth was mainly attributed to increases in foreign exchange swaps (+33.0% or US$139.8 billion), spot transactions (+28.7% or US$38.5 billion) and OTC options (+165.4% or US$31.4 billion). Foreign exchange swap was the most frequently traded instrument, accounting for 64% or US$563.7 billion of the average daily turnover.

Hong Kong retained the top spot as the largest offshore Renminbi foreign exchange and OTC interest rate derivatives centre. The average daily turnover of Renminbi foreign exchange transactions grew by 64.8% to US$315.1 billion in April 2025 from US$191.2 billion in April 2022, while the average daily turnover of Renminbi OTC interest rate derivatives transactions also increased by 67.1% to US$24.5 billion in April 2025 from US$14.7 billion in April 2022.

As regards OTC interest rate derivatives, the average daily turnover in Hong Kong was US$84.1 billion in April 2025, with US dollar, Renminbi and Australian dollar OTC interest rate derivatives being the most actively traded in the Hong Kong market.

Detailed survey results of Hong Kong will be provided in the December issue of the HKMA Quarterly Bulletin.

Note:The turnover part of the survey comprised collection of data on gross turnover in notional amounts of foreign exchange spot, foreign exchange and OTC interest rate derivatives transactions in April 2025. Data were reported on a locational basis, i.e. based on the location of the sales desk of a deal. Turnover figures have been adjusted to exclude double counting of inter-dealer transactions reported by local dealers."
CHP investigates case of invasive meningococcal infection,2025-09-30 21:05,2025-09-30 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/30/P2025093000807.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 30) is investigating a case of invasive meningococcal infection, and reminds the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of contracting this serious disease.

The case involves a 24-year-old male with good past health. He presented with a fever, headache and rash on September 23. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Tuen Mun Hospital on September 27. His blood specimen tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was meningococcaemia. He is still hospitalised and is in critical condition.

An initial investigation revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. His household contacts have remained asymptomatic so far. The CHP will distribute preventive drugs to his close contacts and will continue the investigation. No epidemiological linkages have been established so far between this case and another case recorded this week.

Meningococcal infection is a statutory notifiable disease. Including this case, the CHP has recorded ten cases this year.

Meningococcal infection is caused by a bacterium known as meningococcus. It is mainly transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, of infected persons. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream (meningococcaemia) or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord (meningococcal meningitis). Meningococcaemia is characterised by a sudden onset of fever, an intense headache, purpura, shock and even death in severe cases. Meningococcal meningitis is characterised by high fever, severe headache, stiff neck followed by drowsiness, vomiting, fear of bright light, or rash; it can cause brain damage or even death.

To prevent meningococcal infection, members of the public are advised to take the following measures:


Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly, especially when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing, and clean hands with alcohol-based handrub when they are not visibly soiled;
Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, hold the saliva with a tissue, dispose of nasal and mouth discharge in a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands immediately;
Avoid crowded places;
Avoid close contact with patients who have a fever or severe headache;
Consult doctors about meningococcal vaccination before travelling to high-risk areas; and
Seek medical advice if you become ill after returning from high-risk areas, and discuss your recent travel history with your doctor.

財政司司長出席九龍西區各界協會慶祝中華人民共和國成立七十六周年文藝晚會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-30 20:40,2025-09-30 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/30/P2025093000810.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（九月三十日）出席九龍西區各界協會慶祝中華人民共和國成立七十六周年文藝晚會致辭：

郭長勇副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室九龍工作部副部長)、閻小穎會長（九龍西區各界協會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位街坊、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興出席今晚的文藝晚會，與各位地區朋友同賀國慶。今晚的活動以中華傳統文化為主軸，從中樂到武術、從漢服到戲曲，結合現代的演繹，既有特色，又有意義，讓我們有機會一同感受我國文化的優雅與韻味。

中華文化源遠流長、底蘊深厚。習近平主席曾說過：「泱泱中華，歷史何其悠久、文明何其博大，這是我們的自信之基、力量之源。」隨着我國的經濟、軍事、科技，以至綜合國力不斷提升，中華文化的影響力在全球範圍也不斷擴大。據統計，全球有八十五個國家將中文納入國民教育體系，國際上中文學習者和使用者累計超過二億人。詩詞歌賦、琴棋書畫，正被更多世界各地的朋友發現和欣賞，越來越多的中華文化元素，通過影視、遊戲、動漫、數字化IP（文化知識產權）等走向國際，電影《哪吒2》、遊戲《黑神話：悟空》就是很好的例子。

這些發展讓全球的中國人都感到鼓舞和自豪。這在高度對立、衝突頻仍、單邊主義橫行的當今世界，更有深刻的意義和啓示。求同存異、和而不同、以和為貴等觀念，深植於中國文化，這些價值觀在今天看來，更是國家和國家之間、文明和文明之間的相處之道，值得提倡和弘揚。

弘揚中華文化與愛國主義教育是一脈相承，亦相互促進，這是特區政府的重點工作。在過去厚實的基礎上，今年的《施政報告》提出了一系列的舉措，從加強對學生的愛國主義教育，到舉辦中華文化的節目、展覽和活動，以至加深市民對香港抗戰歷史的認識等，這些都會進一步提升市民對國家和民族的認同與情感連結。今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利八十周年，早前我就和幾位同事參觀過西貢兩個抗戰遺址，追憶香港抗日先烈，奮不顧身保家衞國，讓人感受至深。我們應當珍惜得來不易的和平，更要傳承先輩身先士卒的精神和捨我其誰的擔當。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，九龍西區各界協會自一九九一年成立以來，一直秉持愛國愛港精神，凝心聚力，促進九龍西社區發展，又大力支持特區政府施政，建樹良多。協會除了用心服務居民，也積極舉辦不同類型的活動，團結各界人士，為社區注入活力。我對協會多年來的工作和大家的熱忱表示衷心的感謝。

國慶過後，很快就會迎來全運會。我知道協會已聯同地區文娛康樂體育協會，在旺角及大角咀為市民和旅客設立了「打卡」熱點。希望大家都踴躍支持全運會、支持香港的健兒，有大家的歡呼聲和掌聲，他們一定更加落力，創出佳績，也讓全城的全運會氣氛更加熾熱。

在國慶七十六周年之際，國家正全速推進強國建設和民族復興偉業，中國式現代化開啓了波瀾壯闊的新篇章。在這個時候，香港更要自強不息，發揮好自身所長，貢獻國家所需。期望與大家一起共同努力，為國家的高質量發展、民族的偉大復興貢獻更大力量！

​最後，讓我們再次祝願祖國繁榮昌盛、國泰民安！祝九龍西區各界協會會務竿頭猛進，在座各位盡興而歸、身心康泰。謝謝大家！"

連續兩日錄得兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-09-30 19:47,2025-09-30 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/30/P2025093000717.htm,"​繼昨日（九月二十九日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月三十日）再接獲一宗同類的嚴重個案。中心再次呼籲學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

最新一宗個案涉及一名過往健康良好的六歲女童。她在九月二十日開始出現發燒、咳嗽及流鼻水，九月二十六日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發嚴重肺炎。她目前仍然在該院的兒童深切治療部留醫，情況嚴重。

中心調查發現，女童的一名家居接觸者於九月二十一日曾出現輕微呼吸道病徵，求醫後無需入院。女童曾接種二○二四／二五季度流感疫苗。她的四名同班同學在九月二十八日至二十九日出現輕微流感病徵，全部無需入院，而她學校其他班別暫時未有出現爆發情況。中心已向校方建議需實施的感染控制措施，並會對該校進行醫學監察。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港正值夏季流感季節，學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案自九月起大幅上升。截至九月二十九日，九月開學後涉及學校的爆發個案共有232宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（22宗）、小學（123宗）及中學（87宗）。由開學至今，已錄得九宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，年齡介乎3至17歲，其中七人過往的健康狀況良好。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃已經展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。今年所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生說：「目前已有約2 300間學校（總數的99%）將會舉行流感疫苗學校外展活動，當中約1 300間學校（58%）學校將於下月底或之前進行外展活動，亦有學校已舉行外展活動。未有安排外展活動的學校名單亦會上載到衞生防護中心網站，以便相關學校的家長另行安排子女接種季節性流感疫苗。我呼籲各間學校盡快安排外展活動，各位家長亦不要遲疑，『一年打一次，宜早不宜遲』，盡快安排子女接種季節性流感疫苗，以效預防流感及和減低患流感而出現重症及死亡的風險。」

此外，政府亦已開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下的25個地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間普通科門診和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生提醒高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。
