Hong Kong's Mirs Bay has been selected as an ""Outstanding Example of Beautiful Bays"" with an excellent overall score. This marks the first time the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has received this commendation, highlighting the efforts of the HKSAR Government in marine ecological environment protection, and representing a significant achievement of the HKSAR Government in jointly building the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area into an international, first-class beautiful bay area.

  Located in the northeastern waters of Hong Kong, Mirs Bay presents a beautiful scene of ""clear water and clean beaches, thriving marine life, and harmonious coexistence between humans and the sea"". Its overall Water Quality Objectives compliance rate has reached 100 per cent, achieving Class I of the National Seawater Quality Standard. The bay's rich and diverse ecosystems are important habitats for various nationally protected wild animals, such as hard corals, seahorses, horseshoe crabs and white-bellied sea eagles. The bay area also features the Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark, Yan Chau Tong and Tung Ping Chau Marine Parks, etc, allowing the public to appreciate diverse ecological and geological wonders in the bay at close range and to experience the harmonious coexistence between humans and the sea.

  Furthermore, the HKSAR Government has been strengthening regional co-operation with the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government, deepening exchanges on marine environmental and resource management in Mirs Bay. This collaboration promotes information sharing and emergency response co-ordination, jointly elevating the overall level of ecological environment management. The Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, said that the environmental management of Mirs Bay fully embodies the concept of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, providing an important reference for bay management in densely populated areas of the country. Taking this opportunity of Hong Kong's Mirs Bay being selected as an ""Outstanding Example of Beautiful Bays"", the HKSAR will share its experience in developing beautiful bays with coastal cities on the Chinese Mainland, jointly promoting marine ecological environment protection and sustainable development.

  The HKSAR Government will continue to enhance the quality of the marine ecological environment through the prevention and control of nearshore pollution, co-ordinated ecosystem protection and shoreline remediation, continuously advancing the building of ""Beautiful Bays"".

  The ""Outstanding Examples of Beautiful Bays"" is a campaign launched by the MEE to identify exemplary cases in the field of marine ecological environment protection. It aims to establish replicable and promotable models for comprehensive bay management and advance the vision of building a ""Beautiful China"". This round of the campaign received a total of 72 applications nationwide, with 32 bays designated as ""Beautiful Bays"", of which 12 (including Hong Kong's Mirs Bay) were selected as ""Outstanding Examples of Beautiful Bays"".

Interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements releases latest information on special boundary-crossing and corresponding public transport service arrangements during New Year's Eve and New Year holidays,2025-12-25 20:00,2025-12-25 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/25/P2025122500322.htm,"The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following information today (December 25) on the special boundary-crossing and corresponding public transport service arrangements during New Year's Eve and the New Year holidays.

In view of a series of New Year's Eve countdown events, while the Hong Kong Port of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) and the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port (LMC/HG Port) will maintain 24-hour operations as usual, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government reached a consensus with the relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality to make the following special boundary-crossing arrangements on New Year's Eve to facilitate cross-boundary passenger and vehicular movements:

(1) Passenger clearance services at the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually close at midnight, will be extended to 2am the next day. The operating hours of the MTR East Rail Line will be extended correspondingly, with the departure of the last East Rail Line train from Admiralty to Lo Wu extended to 12.56am; and

(2) Passenger and passenger vehicle clearance services at the Shenzhen Bay Port (SBP), which usually close at midnight, will operate overnight, providing round-the-clock services.

For more effective diversion of cross-boundary private cars on New Year's Day with the implementation of round-the-clock clearance at the SBP, only cross-boundary private cars issued with Closed Road Permits (Permits) for the LMC/HG Port are allowed to use the LMC/HG crossing. For cross-boundary private cars issued with Permits for SBP, LMC/HG, Heung Yuen Wai, Man Kam To Boundary Control Point (BCP) or Sha Tau Kok BCP, they can use the SBP during early-morning hours on New Year's Day.

For cross-boundary coaches, the HKSAR Government has also worked with cross-boundary coach service operators to arrange additional services using the SBP during early-morning hours on New Year's Day, and to enhance the services using the LMC/HG Port, including cross-boundary coaches departing from major stopping points in urban areas such as Wan Chai, Prince Edward and Jordan, as well as a shuttle bus running between the Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange and the LMC/HG Port (Yellow Bus), and the HZMB shuttle bus (Gold Bus). Moreover, a dedicated traffic lane section will be reserved for public transport services at the HZMB, LMC/HG Port, and SBP when necessary, to ensure the smooth operation of public transport services.

As regards local public transport services connecting to BCPs, to tie in with the special round-the-clock passenger clearance arrangements of the SBP on New Year's Day, franchised bus operators will operate two special overnight bus routes, Nos. NB2 and NB3, to provide services to and from Yuen Long/Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun respectively during the overnight period. Furthermore, in the case of travellers using overnight services of the MTR East Rail Line that night, after the closure of the Lo Wu Control Point, they may also take the specially arranged short-working bus service, route No. N73, from MTR Sheung Shui Station to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange, and transfer to the Yellow bus for their journey to Shenzhen.

Residents and visitors may visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, to obtain useful information in one go, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land BCPs, as well as for the Gold Bus and Yellow Bus to plan their trips and save waiting time.

The Transport Department's Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre will operate 24 hours to closely monitor the traffic conditions and public transport services of various districts, the BCPs and major stations; implement contingency measures when necessary to meet service demands; and disseminate the latest traffic information through various channels.

""The full support and co-ordination of the leaders and relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality are crucial to the implementation of the special boundary-crossing arrangements to facilitate the two-way flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland, reflecting the effective and close co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen,"" the spokesman said.

The HKSAR Government will closely monitor the situation and take contingency actions promptly where necessary and deploy manpower flexibly to ensure orderly operations of the BCPs. The Government has formulated contingency plans for the peak periods of cross-boundary travel and made preparations for preventive and control measures to cater for different scenarios. Relevant bureaux and departments have formulated the plans below.

First, with the extension of operating hours at certain BCPs on New Year's Eve, the relevant departments have minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible manpower deployment. Additional counters, temporary counters and channels will be in operation to facilitate passenger and vehicular flow.

Second, the Inter-departmental Joint Command Centre set up by the Hong Kong Police Force, the Immigration Department, the Customs and Excise Department and other relevant departments will be activated from December 31, 2025 to January 4, 2026 to monitor the real-time situations at various BCPs and regularly report to the interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, maintain close liaison with Mainland port authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanism, and take timely contingency actions to flexibly deploy manpower at the BCPs to ensure smooth operation of the land control points.

Third, the Security Bureau will activate the Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre from December 31, 2025 to January 4, 2026 to closely monitor public order matters and co-ordinate any necessary actions at various BCPs, and support the working group in facilitating interdepartmental follow-up actions where necessary to respond promptly to various kinds of emergencies.

The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements is tasked with holistically co-ordinating and steering the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays, as well as strengthening information dissemination to enable the public and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation."
特區政府節慶安排跨部門工作小組發放最新資訊：除夕及元旦特別通關及相應公共交通服務安排,2025-12-25 20:00,2025-12-25 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/25/P2025122500319.htm,"由政務司司長領導的節慶安排跨部門工作小組今日（十二月二十五日），就除夕及元旦期間的特別通關及相應公共交通服務安排，發放以下最新資訊：

因應除夕跨年倒數活動的舉行，除了港珠澳大橋香港口岸及落馬洲／皇崗口岸在除夕夜會如常二十四小時通關外，香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）與廣東省及深圳市相關部門達成共識，在除夕夜作出以下特別通關安排，以疏導跨境人流和車流：

（一）羅湖口岸的旅客清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉，延長至翌日凌晨二時，港鐵東鐵線會相應延長服務時間，由金鐘往羅湖方向的尾班車會延後至凌晨十二時五十六分開出；及

（二）深圳灣口岸的旅客和客車清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉，改為通宵服務，即二十四小時運作。

為更有效分流跨境私家車，在元旦日深圳灣口岸實施二十四小時通關期間，只有持落馬洲管制站封閉道路通行許可證（許可證）的跨境私家車可行走落馬洲／皇崗口岸；至於持有深圳灣口岸、落馬洲／皇崗、香園圍、文錦渡或沙頭角管制站相關許可證的跨境私家車，可在元旦日凌晨時段使用深圳灣口岸。

至於跨境巴士方面，特區政府與跨境巴士服務營辦商安排新增元旦日凌晨時段使用深圳灣口岸的服務，亦會加強使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸的服務，包括由市區主要站點例如灣仔、太子及佐敦等出發的跨境巴士，以及來往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處與落馬洲／皇崗口岸的穿梭巴士（皇巴）和港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）。此外，在有需要時會於港珠澳大橋、落馬洲／皇崗及深圳灣口岸等地設立公共交通專用通道，保障公交服務暢順。

就接駁口岸的本地公共交通服務而言，為配合深圳灣口岸在元旦日二十四小時通關的特別安排，專營巴士營辦商會於凌晨時段營運第NB2號和NB3號兩條特別通宵巴士路線，分別提供往返元朗／天水圍和往返屯門的服務。另外，使用當晚通宵服務的港鐵東鐵線的旅客，在羅湖口岸關閉後，亦可在港鐵上水站乘搭特別開設的第N73號線短程巴士服務前往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處，換乘皇巴前往深圳。

市民及旅客可透過保安局的一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound），取得各陸路邊境管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及金巴和皇巴的平均輪候時間等有用資訊，以便計劃行程及減省等候時間。

運輸署的緊急事故交通協調中心二十四小時運作，密切監察全港各區、邊境管制站和主要車站的交通情況和公共運輸服務，適時採取措施，應對服務需求，並透過各種渠道發放最新的交通消息。

發言人指：「是次落實特別通關安排，便利兩地居民雙向奔赴，實有賴廣東省和深圳市的領導和相關部門的全力支持和配合，反映港深合作高效緊密。」 

特區政府會密切監察情況，有需要時作出迅速應變及靈活調配人手，確保口岸運作暢順。政府已為過關人流高峰期制定額外預案，並做好應對各種情況的準備及防控工作。相關政策局和部門已作出以下部署。

第一，為配合除夕夜個別口岸延長通關時間，口岸部門已減少前線人員休假，以便彈性調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱、臨時櫃枱及通道以疏導人流及車流。

第二，由香港警務處、入境事務處、香港海關及相關部門組成的跨部門聯合指揮中心，將於二○二五年十二月三十一日至二○二六年一月四日期間啓動，實時監察口岸現場情況及定時向節慶安排跨部門工作小組匯報，並與內地口岸部門透過已建立的口岸熱線及即時通報機制保持緊密聯繫，於有需要時迅速應變，靈活調配各管制站人員，確保口岸運作暢順。

第三，保安局亦會在二○二五年十二月三十一日至二○二六年一月四日期間啓動緊急事故監察及支援中心，密切監察及統籌各口岸的公眾秩序，並在有需要時支援工作小組以協調跨部門的跟進行動，迅速應對各種突發情況。

​節慶安排跨部門工作小組負責全面統籌並督導各政府部門有關除夕及元旦期間接待訪港旅客的預備工作，以及加強資訊發布，方便市民及旅客按最新情況規劃行程。"
Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-25 18:05,2025-12-25 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/25/P2025122500576.htm," The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.8 billion as of noon today (December 25). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $4.1 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

Medical support
--------------------

 The Health Bureau (HHB) announced today the latest figures of the primary healthcare services provided to affected residents. Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission, the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1 (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary and more (service workflow see Annex 2). More than 300 private family doctors, more than 360 Chinese medicine practitioners and more than 80 private dentists have participated in the free consultation and free denture replacement services. As of December 23, the hotlines have received over 176 enquiries in total.

 The HHB stressed that, the services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow-up appointments and medication refill service points, from the Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts.

 A total of 79 patients received treatment at various public hospitals due to the fire. As of December 23, 65 of them had already recovered and were discharged, and the remaining 14 are in stable condition. The HA has also provided necessary healthcare services to around 1 600 affected residents.

 From the time of the incident to December 23, the ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"" has received around 660 calls related to the fire incident, and the WhatsApp service has handled about 50 messages concerning the fire incident. As of December 23, the HA's 24-hour Mental Health Direct hotline has received 89 calls related to the fire incident.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

 Currently, there is still a supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer-term accommodation. The transitional housing and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects in different districts can altogether provide around 500 units at the moment. Moreover, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

 As of this morning, a total of 489 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 551 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 591 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the HKHS or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

 The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 2 000 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 51 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Investigation and regulation
-------------------------------

 The Police have arrested a total of 16 individuals on suspicion of manslaughter, including the male person-in-charge of the external wall repair subcontractor of the relevant project, who was arrested yesterday (December 24), and 15 others from various construction companies who were arrested earlier. All arrestees have been released on bail. The Police have accorded top priority to the case and are gathering evidence through various channels for a thorough and in-depth investigation. The possibility of further arrests is not ruled out."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-25 17:30,2025-12-25 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/25/P2025122500498.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 25), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10 of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
