"Hong Kong Customs holds ""Customs YES"" Summer Internship Programme 2025 Certificate Presentation Ceremony (with photos)",2025-11-25 23:10,2025-11-25 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500548.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (November 25) held the ""Customs YES"" Summer Internship Programme 2025 Certificate Presentation Ceremony at the Customs Headquarters Building to present certificates of appreciation and internship certificates to the representatives of the supporting organisations and ""Customs YES"" members respectively.

Delivering a speech at the ceremony, the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat, said that Hong Kong Customs has been organising the Summer Internship Programme for five consecutive years. This year, a total of 130 internship positions were offered both locally and on the Chinese Mainland, attracting more than 1 200 applications from young people. Mr Chan attributed the success of the programme to the unwavering support from the supporting organisations, which enabled young people to gain valuable hands-on experience and take a vital step forward in their career development.

This year's programme featured three key highlights, namely (1) offering, for the first time, internship positions in Beijing and Shenyang, providing young people with exposure to a more diversified job market on the Chinese Mainland and enhancing their competitiveness in the job market there; (2) providing internship opportunities for secondary school students for the second consecutive year, encouraging them to explore their personal aspirations and plan their future career paths at an early stage; and (3) arranging additional internship positions as assistants to Legislative Council (LegCo) Members, enabling participants to gain practical experience and understanding of the work of LegCo Members through participation in policy research, administrative support for LegCo meetings, and community outreach, thereby fostering their interest in public service in future.

Mr Chan also took the opportunity to encourage all attending guests to cast their votes in the 2025 Legislative Council General Election to be held on December 7 to fulfil their civic responsibility and contribute to building a better Hong Kong.

Looking ahead, Customs will continue to collaborate with its business counterparts to create more summer internship opportunities for young people to deepen their understanding of the country and broaden their global horizons, thereby laying a solid foundation for their future development."
HKSAR Government holds second seminar on promotion of spirit of Fourth Plenary Session of 20th CPC Central Committee today (with photos/video),2025-11-25 21:15,2025-11-25 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500738.htm,"Upon the invitation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, with the approval of the Central People's Government, the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council invited the member of the publicity delegation, the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mr Hou Jianguo, and the member of the publicity delegation, the Deputy Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs and the Deputy Director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Rural Affairs, CPC, Mr Zhu Weidong, to visit Hong Kong to speak on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC Central Committee). The HKSAR Government today (November 25) held the second seminar on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee at the Central Government Offices.

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee, the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Zhou Ji, delivered speeches at the seminar. Mr Hou and Mr Zhu gave presentations respectively, providing in-depth explanations of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee as well as the key contents and significance of the Recommendations of the CPC Central Committee for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development. The two members of the publicity delegation also responded to questions raised by participants. Mr Lee delivered the concluding remarks.

He said, ""The Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee deliberated and adopted the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan, making top-level designs and strategic plans for our country's development over the next five years, and putting forward the major objectives and key tasks for economic and social development. It has also made important plans to support Hong Kong's development, painting a brighter future for Hong Kong. In the new era and on its new journey, Hong Kong's strategic position takes on a new meaning. The 15th Five-Year period further clarifies Hong Kong's strategic position and supports Hong Kong in consolidating and enhancing its status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, as well as in building an international innovation and technology centre. This has genuine and far-reaching significance for Hong Kong to fully leverage its unique advantages and important role of having strong support from the Motherland and close connection with the world, to promote Hong Kong's economic and social development, and to better integrate into and serve the overall national development."" Mr Lee hoped that the participants and members of the public would study in depth the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and with a more proactive, pragmatic, responsible, upright yet innovative mindset, fully grasp and integrate this spirit into their daily work and lives. In doing so, they will open up a bright future of long-term prosperity and stability for Hong Kong's economy and society, and make relentless efforts to promote high-quality development of both the country and Hong Kong as well as the building of a great modern socialist country through Chinese modernisation.

In his address, Mr Zhou said that since the 14th Five-Year Plan period, under the strong leadership of President Xi Jinping and the Central Government, our country's economic and social development has achieved new groundbreaking progress, breakthrough transformations, and historic accomplishments. Hong Kong has also addressed the shortcomings in its legal system for safeguarding national security, fully implemented the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"", and entered the best period for focusing on economic growth, pursuing development, advancing projects, and improving people's livelihoods. He believed that through this seminar, everyone would gain a deeper understanding of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee and implement it more effectively. This would help consolidate the positive momentum of Hong Kong's economic and social development, actively respond to the call of the Chief Executive and the HKSAR Government, and conscientiously fulfil citizens' responsibilities in accordance with the law by casting their sacred vote in the eighth Legislative Council General Election, thereby enhancing the governance effectiveness of the HKSAR through high-quality democracy and better fulfilling the important mission of implementing ""one Country, two Systems"" in the new era during the 15th Five-Year Plan period.

At the seminar, Mr Zhu said that the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee has drawn a blueprint for our country's development in the next five years and, standing at a new historical starting point, constitutes another full mobilisation and overall deployment to build on our momentum and continue advancing Chinese modernisation. The 15th Five-Year period holds an important position as a key link between the past and the future in the process of basically realising socialist modernisation. Our economy has a solid foundation, advantages in many areas, strong resilience, and great potential. The conditions for and underlying trend of long-term growth remain unchanged. More and more, we are seeing the strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics, China's enormous market, its complete industrial system, and its abundant human resources all coming to the fore. It is necessary to thoroughly comprehend the guiding principles and major objectives for economic and social development during the 15th Five-Year period, and fully understand the connotations and clear directions proposed by the Plenary Session on ""working for long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao"". He hoped that all sectors of the Hong Kong society would seize the major opportunities of our country's modernisation, proactively align with national strategies such as the national 15th Five-Year Plan, the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and high-quality co-operation under the Belt and Road Initiative, forge new growth drivers and competitive advantages for the economy, better perform Hong Kong's vital role as a bridge and window connecting the Chinese Mainland with the rest of the world, and better integrate into and serve the overall national development.

Mr Hou focused on introducing the strategic tasks and major measures during the 15th Five-Year period that would play a significant leading, driving, and supporting role in advancing Chinese modernisation. Combining these with Hong Kong's situation, he particularly elaborated on the contents of the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan on achieving greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology; promoting high-standard opening up;promoting coordinated regional development; and other aspects. He said that upholding open cooperation and mutual benefit and win-win outcomes is an inherent requirement of Chinese modernisation. The Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan focus on promoting broader international economic flows, advancing reform and development through greater openness and sharing opportunities and achieving common development with the rest of the world, and making plans for promoting high-standard opening up. Hong Kong is an international financial, shipping, and trade centre. By better leveraging its role as a two-way opening bridge and fully strengthening its function as ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", Hong Kong will certainly become a major channel and hub for attracting external resources, as well as a key platform for Mainland enterprises to go global, thereby playing a greater role in assisting the country's high-level opening up. The strategic plans and major measures set out in the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan on promoting the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong will surely guide and advance the implementation of ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong to open a new chapter, enabling Hong Kong to make greater contributions in the historical process of comprehensively building a modern socialist country and realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

About 500 persons from various sectors of the community, including Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress, HKSAR members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, community leaders, representatives from industrial and commercial sectors, professional sectors, education sectors, media organisations, etc., and youth representatives, attended the seminar."

政務司副司長出席Q嘜成立47周年暨准用證頒發典禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-11-25 20:33,2025-11-25 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500546.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（十一月二十五日）出席Q嘜成立47周年暨准用證頒發典禮的致辭：

尊敬的梁君彥主席（立法會主席）、林世豪主席（香港工業總會主席）、陳嘉賢主席（香港優質標誌局主席、香港工業總會副主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今晚很高興能與各位共聚一堂，出席Q嘜成立47周年准用證頒發典禮。首先，我向今晚獲頒Q嘜的機構致以真摯的祝賀！

香港工業總會（工總）轄下的香港優質標誌局由一九七八年成立至今，一直是推動優質概念的先鋒，利用不同Q嘜計劃提升公司產品、服務及環保方面的質量標準。為配合急速變化的市場需求，香港優質標誌局先後推出了新的認證計劃，包括Q STEM認證、Q-ESG認證和Q嘜優質清真計劃等。經過定期嚴格監控，這些認證計劃讓顧客在消費時，對印有Q嘜標誌的產品和已獲認證的服務及產品更具信心，Q嘜亦已成為香港家傳戶曉優質品牌的標誌。

在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，是一個充滿活力、自由開放、便利且安全的營商之地。為保持香港品牌的競爭力以及堅守追求卓越的核心價值，一個可以信賴的認證服務是重要的支撐。隨着Q嘜認證計劃涵蓋的商品和服務不斷擴展，Q嘜認證不單是香港經濟發展和提升消費者信心的重要推動力，對提升旅客在港消費的信心亦起重要作用。

行政長官在去年《施政報告》提出成立促進銀髮經濟工作組（工作組），由我擔任組長，積極應對高齡化帶來的各種挑戰，並在挑戰中抓緊發展機遇。工作組經深入探討後，已在今年五月公布30項涵蓋五大範疇的措施。正如行政長官於今年《施政報告》中提及，其中推廣「銀色品質保證」方面的工作包括由政府聯同工總制訂為銀色產品而設的Q嘜，以及與業界進一步研究更多銀色產品的「灣區標準」，便利業界為長者提供更多選擇。

我很高興工總今晚將正式發布「香港Q嘜樂悠計劃」（「樂悠Q嘜」）。這個計劃將認證樂齡產品，包括食品、日用品和科技產品等，促進業界提升銀色產品質量，為老友記及其家人／照顧者帶來信心保證。此外，我亦樂見工總將與香港社會服務聯會以「照護食」作為起始項目簽訂意向書，深化就發展銀髮經濟的合作、知識交流和行業推廣等。我期待透過各界共同努力推廣「銀色品質保證」，能夠推動本地經濟發展及提升長者的生活質素，令長者真正擁有黃金歲月。

今晚，我們亦見證了來自各行各業的傑出機構榮獲Q嘜認證，從銷售食品、電器、家居用品以至公共事業、物業管理等，涵蓋民生所需與專業服務，展現香港產業生態多元活力。今晚亦會頒發首批獲Q嘜清真認證的品牌，讓穆斯林市民和旅客更容易識別優質商戶，以及首批獲Q-Carbon認證的品牌，持續積極推廣企業使用清潔能源和可再生能源。我祝賀所有獲得Q嘜認證的機構，相信大家會繼續不斷提升其產品或服務的辨識度和品質，並激勵同行一起進步，讓香港品牌在世界舞台綻放光芒。我亦期待有更多機構加入「樂悠Q嘜」及其他Q嘜計劃的行列，讓社會各界同心協力提供更多優質的香港品牌，向世界說好香港故事。

今晚大家其實已經聽了起碼兩次呼籲，就是十二月七日記得去投票。我認為這是非常正確，我非常認同，所以相信大家都不會反對，我再講第三次，大家的掌聲給我很大信心。十二月七日的立法會換屆選舉將會舉行，大家要踴躍投票，大家都有自己公司的僱員或親朋戚友，請在鼓勵他們或提供一些便利措施，十二月七日投票，選出有能力、有幹勁、有擔當的立法會議員，以促進香港的社會經濟發展，為香港創造更美好的未來。多謝大家。"

DH conducts interdepartmental exercise on prevention and control of Ebola disease to enhance Government's response capabilities to communicable diseases and strengthen exchanges with Chinese Mainland and international community (with photos),2025-11-25 20:16,2025-11-25 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500722.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH), in collaboration with multiple government departments, today (November 25) conducted a public health exercise codenamed ""Amethyst"" to enhance their response capabilities in dealing with a case of Ebola disease and to increase awareness among stakeholders about the handling of public health emergencies. Approximately 40 representatives from the DH, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the Fire Services Department and the Civil Aid Service participated in this ground movement exercise. To strengthen exchanges with the Chinese Mainland and the international community, over 20 experts from the National Health Commission (NHC), the National Disease Control and Prevention Administration (NDCPA), Shaanxi Province, Hubei Province, Guangdong Province, Chinese Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Singapore health authorities were invited to attend as observers.

  The exercise was held at the Penny's Bay Community Isolation Facility today. Under the exercise simulation, the CHP received a notification about a manual worker suspected of having Ebola disease, prompting an immediate epidemiological investigation. Upon laboratory confirmation of the case, the CHP co-ordinated with relevant government departments according to the established mechanism to conduct on-site investigations and risk assessment, as well as to implement control measures to prevent the spread of the virus at the lodgings where the patient was accommodated. Simultaneously, the exercise simulated the transfer of the patient to isolation facilities, environmental disinfection, contact tracing, and the arrangement of quarantine.

  This ground movement exercise is the second part of the public health exercise ""Amethyst"". The first part, a table-top exercise, was completed on November 12, in which eight relevant government departments and the Hospital Authority discussed and co-ordinated the emergency response measures required in a scenario when an imported case of Ebola disease was reported in Hong Kong.

  ""This exercise was successfully completed and provided valuable opportunities for all the relevant participating units to test each individual aspect in handling public health emergencies, ensuring seamless co-ordination and efficient collaboration. It also effectively enhanced every stakeholder's awareness of prevention and control, as well as their response capabilities in dealing with cases of Ebola disease. The DH has previously conducted 32 exercises on the prevention and control of communicable diseases, including simulations of measles, plague, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and human avian influenza cases. These exercises aim to enhance the disease prevention awareness of both the community and healthcare workers and to continuously refine all public health emergency preparedness and response plans, ensuring readiness for potential outbreaks,"" the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, said.

  ""This exercise, featuring experts from various regions, presents a golden opportunity. As observers, they provided us with advice on prevention and control, enabling us to compare and align communicable disease response measures. This will help refine the Hong Kong SAR's contingency plans for preventing and controlling highly contagious diseases,"" he added.

  Ebola disease is a severe acute viral illness, with human-to-human transmission resulting from direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected people, and indirect contact with environments contaminated with such body fluids. According to information from the World Health Organization, the case fatality rates from past Ebola outbreaks range between 25 per cent and 90 per cent, and the average is around 50 per cent. Locally, viral haemorrhagic fever (including Ebola disease) is one of the statutory notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong.

宣講會上，祝衛東表示，中共二十屆四中全會擘畫了我國未來五年的發展藍圖，是新的歷史起點上乘勢而上、接續推進中國式現代化建設的又一次總動員、總部署。「十五五」時期在基本實現社會主義現代化進程中具有承前啓後的重要地位。我國經濟基礎穩、優勢多、韌性強、潛能大，長期向好的支撐條件和基本趨勢沒有變，中國特色社會主義制度優勢、超大規模市場優勢、完整產業體系優勢、豐富人才資源優勢更加彰顯。要深刻領會「十五五」時期經濟社會發展的指導方針和主要目標，把握全會提出的「促進香港、澳門長期繁榮穩定」的豐富內涵和明確指向。希望香港社會各界抓住國家現代化建設的重大機遇，主動對接國家「十五五」規劃、粵港澳大灣區建設和高質量共建「一帶一路」等國家戰略，塑造經濟發展新動能新優勢，更好發揮香港連接祖國內地同世界各地的重要橋樑和窗口作用，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

展覽分為四個展區——「美學的氛圍」、「時間的積累」、「空間的定格」和「品茶的意境」，展出藏品包括南宋的建窰黑釉兔毫斑茶盞、清代的藍地描金琺瑯彩開光雞蝶紋鼓腹壺、十八世紀的紫砂胎剔紅夔龍紋壺和玲瓏八竹壺等。

木藝家翁泳恩和竹藝家林嘉裕從館藏茶具獲得靈感及啓發，分別創作了九組和十一組作品，不僅傳承榫卯與竹編等傳統工藝，更融入當代藝術的表現手法。展品形式多樣，既有小巧、凸顯木材原始肌理的茶碗與精緻的竹雕茶具，也有高約兩米的入榫茶架和長度超過三米的竹編茶席，演繹都市人在忙裏偷閒的品茶趣味。

她們在創作過程中着重與香港的連結，以香港命名的動植物及城市和郊外風景為題材，透過溫潤的木與堅韌的竹，用作品展現她們眼中香港的獨特風貌。

茶具文物館地下活動室經翁泳恩精心打造成為茶室，讓觀眾小休及沉思。不同活動亦會在此茶室舉行，包括茶藝示範、「鬥茶」示範，以及由藝術家帶領的木和竹藝茶具工作坊。

The two artists integrate the aesthetics of the Song dynasty, with rustic simplicity and unpretentious elegance, into daily life. They delve into tea culture and uncover its intriguing connection to Hong Kong, engaging visitors in a journey that transcends tradition and modernity.

The exhibition is divided into four galleries: ""Aesthetic Ambience"", ""Accumulation of Time"", ""Frozen in Space"" and ""Art of Tea Tasting"". Exhibits include a tea bowl with hare's fur russet markings in black glaze Jian ware from the Southern Song dynasty; a globular shaped teapot with a hen and butterflies design in reserved panels on red enamel and gilt on blue ground from the Qing dynasty; a purple clay teapot encased in carved red lacquer with archaic dragons on diaper ground, and a cylindrical shaped teapot with an eight-lobed outer wall pierced with a bamboo motif from the 18th century.

Drawing inspiration from the museum's collections, wood artist Yung and bamboo artist Lam created nine and 11 sets of works, respectively. The works inherit the traditional craftsmanship of joinery and bamboo weaving, and integrate expressions of contemporary art. Their works are diverse in form, featuring small tea bowls that highlight the natural grains of wood, exquisite bamboo carved tea ware, as well as mortise tea racks approximately 2 metres tall and bamboo woven tea tables over 3m long, interpreting the enjoyment of tea drinking among urbanites who capture moments of leisure amidst their busy lives.

The artists emphasise intriguing connections with Hong Kong during their creative process. They draw inspiration from flora and fauna named after Hong Kong, as well as urban and rural landscapes. Through warm wood and resilient bamboo, they express their visions of Hong Kong's uniqueness in their works.

The tea room, meticulously constructed by Yung in the museum's Activity room on the G/F, will provide visitors with a space to relax and reflect. Various tea-related activities will also be held in the tea room, including a tea demonstration and a special ""tea contest"", as well as artist workshops on wooden and bamboo tea-ware making.

The Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware is located at 10 Cotton Tree Drive, Central (inside Hong Kong Park). For details of the exhibition, please visit the website at hk.art.museum/en/web/ma/mt-thematic-exhibition.html."

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得71宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。


政府全方位跟進
———————

就近日錄得五宗輸入個案的患者均居於青衣，中心的流行病學調查顯示，他們在潛伏期及發病後在青衣北活動的範圍有重疊，主要包括青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近。中心已把個案活動的地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），進行控蚊滅蚊行動。中心亦正就病人樣本進行基因排序及分析，並對比其他本地及輸入個案，以確定他們之間是否有關聯。由於部分確診個案報稱，在青衣自然徑行山期間曾被蚊叮咬，中心認為青衣自然徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線（2125 2373），熱線每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗，而過去兩天中心未有接獲有病徵人士致電查詢。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-25 18:15,2025-11-25 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500620.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 25), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 71 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

 Among the recently recorded imported cases, five reside in Tsing Yi. The CHP's epidemiological investigation revealed that their activities during the incubation and infectious periods overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily around Tsing Yi town centre and the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The CHP has notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the locations visited by the five patients for mosquito control operations. The CHP is also performing genomic sequencing and analysis on patient samples, comparing them with other local and imported cases, to determine whether these cases are linked. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have hiked in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area since November 1 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary. The CHP has not received any enquiries from symptomatic individuals over the past two days. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy organises Shanghai Foreign-Related Adjudication Talent Training Course in Shanghai (with photos),2025-11-25 18:14,2025-11-25 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500278.htm,"The Shanghai Foreign-Related Adjudication Talent Training Course, co-organised by the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy and the Shanghai High People's Court, was held from November 23 to 25 at the Changning campus of the East China University of Political Science and Law (ECUPL).The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, delivered a video speech at the closing ceremony of the training course today (November 25) and the President of the Shanghai High People's Court, Mr Jia Yu, also delivered a speech at the closing ceremony.

The three-day training course precisely matched with the training needs of the 70 judges from the first batch of the foreign-related adjudication talent pool from Shanghai, and invited nearly 30 core foreign-related adjudication judges from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to participate, building a collaborative training mechanism for foreign-related judicial talent in the Yangtze River Delta region. The training course focused on practical difficulties in foreign-related adjudication, including the characteristics of Hong Kong’s common law under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, its comparison and interaction with the Mainland's codified law, and practical issues such as contract law, law of evidence, judicial reviews of arbitration, ascertainment of foreign law, and drafting of judgments. The training course invited various experienced legal professionals from Hong Kong and members of the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Expert Committee to deliver lectures, assisting the participants in better understanding the basic framework and principles of common law and enhancing their ability to handle cross-border cases.

  Mr Lam said in his video speech that under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is the only region in the country implementing common law, and is the world's unique bilingual common law jurisdiction using both Chinese and English as official languages. He expressed the hope that the participants have gained a deeper understanding of the differences between the common law and civil law systems, strengthening exchanges and interactions on Hong Kong’s common law and Mainland laws. In his speech, Mr Jia also affirmed the benefits of the training course to the foreign-related adjudication talent from Shanghai and the Yangtze River Delta Region, and expressed his wish to continue collaboration efforts to organise such activities on a regular basis.

In addition, the Hong Kong Common Law Day, co-organised by the Training Academy and the ECUPL, was also held on November 24 at the Songjiang campus of the ECUPL. It brought together experts from universities, judicial and legal practice sectors in Hong Kong and the Mainland, sharing their views on common law and nurturing foreign-related talent with over 100 scholars and students, along with their practical experiences in handling cross-border foreign-related disputes. The participants have engaged in comprehensive dialogues from theory to practice, exploring the uniqueness of common law relief systems.

The Training Academy will continue to organise and improve its practical legal courses, inviting more experts from Hong Kong and the world, exploring diverse training models, and providing platforms for legal exchanges and training for Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland, and countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, with a view to consolidating Hong Kong's position as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region and enabling Hong Kong to play a greater role in the country's construction of foreign-related rule of law."

Vice President Li (Vice President for Talent and International Strategy and Chair Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, the City University of Hong Kong, Professor Li Wen-jung), Professor Ho (Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences of the City University of Hong Kong, Professor Alfred Ho), Consul General Ficarra (Consul General of Italy in Hong Kong and Macao, Mr Carmelo Ficarra), Mr Naldini (Director of Fondazione Pistoletto Cittadellarte and representative of Third Paradise, Mr Paolo Naldini), Ms Maino (Ambassador of Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (CNMI), Ms Sara Sozzani Maino), Mr Guardini (Conscious Creative Director of the Fashion to Reconnect, Mr Tiziano Guardini), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon, and a very warm welcome to ""Fashion to Reconnect: A Tale of Two Style Capitals"".

It is my tremendous pleasure to join you at this special moment, where Hong Kong and Italy meet through the powerful lenses of fashion, art and sustainability.

""Fashion to Reconnect"" is organised by the City University of Hong Kong, supported by the Consulate General of Italy in Hong Kong, and brought to life in partnership with Fondazione Pistoletto Cittadellarte, and Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, or CNMI in brief, the esteemed organiser of Milan Fashion Week. My heartfelt thanks to all our partners for making this visionary programme a reality in Hong Kong. We eagerly anticipate even closer collaborations between Hong Kong and Italy in the cultural and creative industries.

At the heart of this project is the visionary concept of the Third Paradise by Michelangelo Pistoletto-a call to rebalance artifice and nature. Hong Kong's interpretation is both ambitious and uniquely our own: six site-specific Third Paradise art installations are unfolding across five of our city's cultural landmarks. These include the Sophia Loren House in Wan Chai, Hong Kong International Airport, the main campus of the City University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, and the Hung Hom Harbourfront Promenade. These works invite everyone to experience sustainability in familiar urban spaces, reimagined through fabrics, movement, light and storytelling.

Here at ArtisTree, the ""Fashion to Reconnect"" exhibition, curated by Mr Tiziano Guardini, brings together sustainable masterpieces from 16 Italian brands and artisans with the creativity of nine Hong Kong-based designers. From couture craftsmanship to circular materials, from archive footwear to experimental silhouettes, this is a journey that elevates fashion as both an artistic medium and a social fabric.

In the coming days, we will convene a symposium, a roundtable and seminars, gathering elite professionals from Italy, Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area. These platforms are designed to exchange perspectives on sustainable fashion and cross-sector collaboration, fostering partnerships that will amplify the impact of creativity across global markets.

""Fashion to Reconnect"" is a highlight of the Hong Kong Fashion Fest 2025. Sponsored by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and organised by our industry partners, the Hong Kong Fashion Fest is transforming our city into a dazzling stage for global fashion and creative dialogue from November 22 to December 7. We are proud to ""bring in"" global excellence, while ""going out"" with Hong Kong's distinctive voice.

Finally, as we look to the future, I would like to encourage all eligible voters in Hong Kong to fulfil our civic responsibility by voting in the 2025 Legislative Council General Election on December 7. Together, we can continue to build a better Hong Kong.

Before I close, I wish to congratulate ""Fashion to Reconnect"" on a grand opening and convey my very best wishes for ""Fashion to Reconnect"" a resounding success. Thank you."

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that the value of merchandise exports grew markedly further by 17.5% in October over a year earlier. Exports to most major markets saw robust growth. Analysed by commodity, exports of most major commodities increased, particularly for exports of electrical equipment, machinery and mechanical appliances which sustained strong growth.

  Looking ahead, sustained moderate growth of the global economy, coupled with easing in external trade policy uncertainty recently and persistent demand for electronic-related products, should be conducive to Hong Kong's merchandise trade growth in the near term. The Government's ongoing effort to enhance Hong Kong’s economic and trade ties with different markets will also continue to provide support. Yet, the lingering impacts of trade barriers still warrant attention. The Government will stay vigilant.

二零二五年首十個月的商品整體出口貨值較二零二四年同期上升13.8%。同時，商品進口貨值上升13.6%。二零二五年首十個月錄得有形貿易逆差3,340億元，相等於商品進口貨值的7.3%。

經季節性調整的數字顯示，截至二零二五年十月止的三個月與對上三個月比較，商品整體出口貨值下跌1.6%。同時，商品進口貨值下跌1.9%。

按國家／地區分析

二零二五年十月份與二零二四年同月比較，輸往亞洲的整體出口貨值上升15.6%。此地區內，輸往大部分主要目的地的整體出口貨值錄得升幅，尤其是馬來西亞（升139.4%）、越南（升56.0%）、台灣（升50.2%）、印度（升31.8%）和中國內地（內地）（升9.8%）。

除亞洲的目的地外，輸往其他地區的大部分主要目的地的整體出口貨值錄得升幅，尤其是荷蘭（升56.8%）和美國（升40.5%）。

評論

政府發言人表示，十月商品出口貨值進一步大幅增長，按年上升17.5%。輸往大部分主要市場的出口均蓬勃增長。按商品類別分析，大部分主要商品的出口上升，尤其是電動設備、機械及機械用具的出口持續強勁增長。

展望未來，環球經濟維持溫和增長，加上近期外圍貿易政策的不確定性減退和對電子相關產品的需求持續，應會在短期內有利香港的商品貿易增長。政府一直致力加強香港與不同市場的經貿聯繫亦將繼續提供支持。然而，貿易壁壘的持續影響仍值得關注。政府將保持警覺。

​財經事務及庫務局局長在「信報ESG論壇2025──創新推動綠色可持續未來」致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-11-25 16:15,2025-11-25 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500528.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（十一月二十五日）在「信報ESG論壇2025──創新推動綠色可持續未來」的致辭全文：

鄭主席（《信報財經新聞》（《信報》）主席兼行政總裁鄭善強）、鄧總（《信報》總編輯鄧傳鏘）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。很高興今天有機會參與由《信報》主辦，以「創新推動綠色可持續未來」為主題的ESG論壇2025，與大家分享香港在綠色和可持續金融方面的最新發展。

正如剛才鄧總所說，這六年來，ESG（環境、社會及管治）由概念變成很具體的行動，我相信大家來不是為形象，而是看到ESG的發展對經濟、社會，甚至全球都有所禆益。

在這方面，我相信氣候變化無疑是當今全球面臨最緊迫的挑戰之一。香港是福地，雖然今年我們遇上颱風的次數破紀錄地多，但相對其他地方，我們生活上受到的影響仍然有限。颱風或極端天氣在香港以外地方造成人命傷亡、地方嚴重受破壞的新聞時有所聞。香港作為地球村的一分子如何可以為應對氣候變化出多點力呢？剛於巴西貝倫落幕的第30屆聯合國氣候變化大會（COP30）為我們帶來答案。會議再次強調綠色資金在應對氣候變化中的關鍵作用。聯合國負責氣候行動的助理秘書長指出，發展中國家更受氣溫上升影響，因此要確保它們更快、更大規模地獲得氣候融資，改善基建系統。有與會代表亦提出要在早於危機出現前增強發展中國家的抵禦能力，意味要擴大氣候融資的規模。不少地區代表都認為，合理配置財政資源是將計劃轉化為實際進展及願景轉化為具體行動的關鍵。

作為亞洲領先的國際金融中心和可持續金融樞紐，香港擁有既深且廣的資本市場，而政府亦將綠色和可持續金融列為重點工作之一，積極引導國際資本投資至不同領域的可持續發展項目，為綠色金融轉型出力。截至今年九月，香港已有超過200隻獲證監會（證券及期貨事務監察委員會）認可的ESG基金，資產管理規模超過1.1萬億港元，較三年前分別增長百分之三十二及百分之二十三。債券市場方面，去年香港的綠色和可持續債務發行總額超過840億美元。其中約430億美元的綠色和可持續債券由香港安排發行總額，自二○一八年起連續七年居亞洲區市場的首位，佔地區總額約百分之四十五。

為更有效推動綠色金融轉型，政府一直與金融監管機構（包括香港金融發展局）和持份者緊密合作，循推動創新、市場發展、培養人才和國際及區域合作四個方向推動可持續金融發展，完善香港的綠色金融生態系統。接下來，我會向大家闡述一下我們循這四個方向做了甚麼，未來又有甚麼展望。

（一）推動創新

在政府可持續債券計劃下，我們自二○一九年起已成功發行合共約2,500億港元（約320億美元）等值的政府綠色債券，涵蓋港元、人民幣、美元和歐元四個幣種和不同年期（一至30年），為多個本地綠色項目融資。另外，政府本月中第三度成功發行代幣化綠色債券，等值接近100億港元，在交收過程中更應用了人民幣及港元代幣化央行貨幣（e-CNY及e-HKD），為未來融入其他形式的數碼貨幣奠定基礎，同時促進不同數碼基建之間的互操作性，充分展示香港在結合債券市場、綠色和可持續金融，以及金融科技方面的優勢和領導地位。特區政府會通過恆常化發行代幣化債券，助力市場建立更全面的基準，擴大數字金融的更廣泛應用，鼓勵產品和服務創新。

去年，政府推出綠色和可持續金融科技概念驗證測試資助計劃，很長的計劃名字，但其實是聚焦proof of concept，提供前期資助，推動進行綠色金融科技活動的科技公司或研究機構與本地企業合作，開發處理行業痛點而市場上未有使用案例的項目，以助力有關方案商業化和完成概念驗證，計劃已批出60個綠色金融科技方案，讓有潛力的綠色和可持續金融科技於香港的商業環境中更廣泛應用。

（二）市場發展

除了政府領頭外，業界在綠色金融市場的參與亦非常重要。我們推出的綠色和可持續金融資助計劃鼓勵更多綠色融資活動在港進行，同時吸引更多金融和專業服務提供者在港開設或擴充業務，以構建綠色金融生態圈。計劃已延長三年至二○二七年，並擴大資助範圍至轉型債券及貸款，鼓勵區內相關行業更充分利用香港的轉型融資平台，逐步實現減碳目標。截至今年十一月初，我們已向超過620筆在香港發行的綠色和可持續債務工具批出超過3.9億港元資助，涉及的債務總值超過1,700億美元（超過1.3萬億港元）。

香港金融管理局（金管局）去年五月也發表了首階段的香港可持續金融分類目錄，為市場參與者作出與綠色和可持續金融相關的決策時能有據可依，從而積極引導全球長期資本為符合《巴黎協定》的經濟活動提供融資，釋除「漂綠」憂慮。首階段的分類目錄已獲銀行和企業採用。為求分類目錄能更便於使用，金管局剛就第2A階段的原型完成公眾諮詢。第2A階段的原型引入多項優化措施，包括擴闊涵蓋的行業、增加經濟活動、加入包括中期減碳目標等轉型元素，以及新增「適應氣候變化」這項環境目標，以回應日益增長的融資需求。

（三）培養人才

推動綠色發展離不開對人才的培養。在技能培訓方面，政府於二○二二年年底推出綠色和可持續金融培訓先導計劃，供本地合資格從業員、相關專業人士和修讀相關學科的學生及畢業生申請。截至本月中，由本地大學的專業進修學院、專業機構、國際培訓機構等提供的合資格培訓及資歷接近100個，並會不斷更新。我們亦已批出超過9 100宗申請，資助總額約5,200萬港元。為持續支持本地綠色金融人才的培訓，這個計劃會延長至二○二八年。

我們也透過大型會議、研討會及其他持份者交流活動，加強與綠色和可持續金融相關的技能培訓和合作。今年九月圓滿舉行的第二屆香港綠色周獲得65家國際及本地公私營機構的支持，共舉辦42場活動，吸引超過14 500位來自全球逾75個地區的商業領袖、專家與學者齊聚香港。嘉賓對於香港綠色周活動的深度以及參與機構的多元化程度都有很高評價。

（四）國際及區域合作

可持續發展依靠世界各地的通力合作。在可持續披露方面，我們積極支持國際財務報告可持續披露準則（ISSB準則）的應用，去年十二月推出香港可持續披露路線圖，就大型公眾責任實體不遲於二○二八年全面採用ISSB準則提供清晰的路徑。國際財務報告準則基金會今年六月確認香港為全球首批以全面採用ISSB準則為目標的司法管轄區。政府會繼續聯同金融監管機構及持份者，支持香港可持續披露準則的實施。

香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）國際碳交易平台Core Climate是全球唯一以港元及人民幣結算自願碳信用的交易平台。港交所今年九月更與廣州碳排放權交易中心、深圳綠色交易所及澳門國際碳排放權交易所簽署合作備忘錄。這份大灣區內碳交易所之間的首份四方協議進一步推動知識交流與分享，加強區內碳市場和綠色金融生態圈發展的合作。未來，我們會繼續致力推動產品創新發展，金管局正聯同港交所合作研究碳交易代幣化技術的應用。政府亦會聯同內地相關監管部門和機構，研究國家參與國際碳市場的相關事宜。

大家若記得，我們在本月初舉辦了香港金融科技周，每年十一月都舉辦的。在今年的金融科技周，除金融科技外，還有另一個宣布，那就是總部設於北京的亞洲基礎設施投資銀行（亞投行）宣布決定在香港設立辦事處。金立群行長（亞投行行長）宣布決定時就指出，香港一直堅實和積極地支持亞投行工作，而香港作為亞洲領先的綠色金融樞紐，更是實現經濟轉型，將保護環境的項目轉化為可投資項目的理想地。現時，亞投行已與金管局及香港按揭證券有限公司建立了戰略合作夥伴關係，透過貸款、基金投資、創投項目、基建貸款抵押證券等方式，為亞洲的可持續發展和氣候轉型調動資金，加速亞洲地區向可持續繁榮未來的轉型進程。日後，我們會繼續全力協助亞投行透過助力基礎設施融資，推動亞洲基礎設施的可持續發展，尤其是亞投行在香港設立了辦事處以後。

最後，我祝願今日的論壇圓滿成功，相信大家也會從今日的多個討論環節中對ESG與可持續發展領域的關鍵議題有更深入了解，與我們一起為全球可持續發展出力。謝謝。"
消防處在香港和潮州舉行國際水域救援技術交流會議（附圖）,2025-11-25 15:55,2025-11-25 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112400489.htm,"消防處今日（十一月二十五日）至十一月二十八日在香港和潮州舉行為期四日的國際水域救援技術交流會議，讓來自內地、香港、澳門以及鄰近亞太地區的救援人員就水域救援專業交流經驗。會議由消防工程師學會（香港分會）和中國香港消防協會協辦。

開幕典禮今日在消防及救護學院舉行，由國家消防救援局副局長徐忠舜、保安局局長鄧炳強、消防處處長楊恩健、副處長（行動）陳慶勇、副處長（公眾安全及機構策略）黃嘉榮，以及香港賽馬會董事龔楊恩慈主禮。

鄧炳強在典禮上致辭時說，氣候變化加劇令極端天氣越趨頻繁，強度亦更高。他指出水域救援是極具挑戰的高風險救援任務，是次會議的寶貴交流機會讓區內專才與前線人員加深互相了解，分享最優質的實戰經驗，令協作基礎更為穩固。他又寄望香港消防處為國家災害管理作出切實貢獻，加深國際合作，跨地域攜手守護生命。

楊恩健感謝來自亞太地區的前線水域救援專才首次雲集本港，就救援技術深入交流，以期為社會提供更優質的服務。他指出氣候變化帶來強烈颱風及嚴重水浸，讓救援人員實踐救災扶危使命更刻不容緩，因此跨地區救援協作可發揮最大的影響力。他希望是次交流讓各地救援團隊培養不斷追求進步的文化，同時展現對追求更卓越水域救援水平的共同承諾。

國際水域救援技術交流會議首兩天活動在香港舉行，讓參與者透過個人及團體實地訓練、救援工具展示、救援個案經驗分享等環節，交流水域救援技術和心得，並探討應用在所屬地區的可行性。隨後，交流團將於十一月二十七日前往潮州，參觀國家東南區域應急救援中心，了解國家如何利用先進科技令救援技術和訓練更臻完善，並到市內水浸風險較高的地點視察，了解國家在水浸事故中的應對策略。

國際水域救援技術交流會議是「香港消防處災難防控計劃」下的重點項目之一，由香港賽馬會慈善信託基金捐助。來自國家消防救援局、澳門消防局、澳門海關，以及汶萊、印尼、馬來西亞、馬爾代夫、緬甸、南韓、泰國和越南八個亞太地區國家的救援人員參與會議，一同為強化水域救援的跨地域專業合作及持續發展貢獻力量。"
FSD holds International Aquatic Rescue Technical Exchange in HK and Chaozhou (with photos),2025-11-25 15:55,2025-11-25 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112400491.htm,"âThe Fire Services Department (FSD) holds the International Aquatic Rescue Technical Exchange (IARTX) in Hong Kong and Chaozhou between today (November 25) and November 28. The four-day IARTX aims to bring together personnel of rescue teams from the Mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and neighbouring Asia-Pacific regions for experience sharing in aquatic rescue operations. The IARTX is co-organised by the Institution of Fire Engineers (Hong Kong Branch) and the China Hong Kong Fire Protection Association.

The opening ceremony, officiated by Deputy Director General of the National Fire and Rescue Administration Mr Xu Zhongshun; the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; the Director of Fire Services, Mr Andy Yeung; the Deputy Director of Fire Services (Operations), Mr Derek Armstrong Chan; the Deputy Director of Fire Services (Public Safety and Corporate Strategy), Mr Wong Ka-wing; and Steward of Hong Kong Jockey Club Mrs Ann Kung, was held today at the Fire and Ambulance Services Academy.

In his speech delivered at the ceremony, Mr Tang mentioned that the more apparent climate change has become, the more it has been causing extreme weather to be more frequent and intense. Noting that aquatic rescue has been among the most challenging and high-risk emergency operations, Mr Tang said he believes that the valuable interactions at the IARTX are essential for experts and frontline practitioners from across the region to deepen mutual understanding, share best practices and foster robust operational co-ordination. He also expressed his hope in the FSD's capability to make a concrete contribution to the country's strategies on disaster management, deepening international partnership to better protect lives across the region.

Mr Yeung welcomed the frontline aquatic rescuers and experts from the Asia-Pacific region who are converging for the first time in Hong Kong for an in-depth exchange of rescue techniques, sharing a common hope of better serving the communities. He noted that the more intense typhoons and severe flooding brought by climate change have made the mission of emergency rescue more critical than ever, and that the greatest impact can be achieved through cross-regional collaboration. He expected the exchange to foster a culture of continuous improvement among rescue teams, with their shared dedication to further excel in aquatic rescue standards being showcased.

The IARTX takes place in Hong Kong for the first two days, offering participants activities including individual and group on-site training, rescue equipment demonstrations, and experience-sharing sessions. They can share experiences on aquatic rescue operations and explore the feasibility of applying certain techniques in their own regions. On November 27, the participants will travel to Chaozhou and visit the National Southeast Emergency Rescue Center to learn about the country's efforts in enhancing rescue techniques and personnel training with advanced technologies. They will also inspect spots with higher flood risk to understand the country's rescue strategies for flooding.

The IARTX is one of the key initiatives under the Fire Services Department's Disaster Management Programme funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. Participants include rescue personnel from the National Fire and Rescue Administration, the Macao Fire Services Bureau, the Macao Customs, and representatives from eight Asia-Pacific countries, namely Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. They join hands to strengthen cross-regional professional co-operation and contribute to the continuous development of aquatic rescue operations."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on November 24 to noon today (November 25), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 76 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit.

Through risk assessment, Customs on the abovementioned dates intercepted two incoming lorries at the HZMB Hong Kong Port. After inspection, Customs officers found the batch of suspected counterfeit goods, including mobile phones, footwear, bags and accessories, inside the cargo compartments of the lorries. Two 60-year-old male drivers were subsequently arrested.

An initial investigation revealed that the batch of suspected counterfeit goods would have been transshipped to overseas regions.

The investigation is ongoing, and the arrested men have been released on bail pending further investigation.

保安局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-25 14:17,2025-11-25 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500379.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十一月二十五日）上午出席國際水域救援技術交流會議開幕典禮後會見傳媒的談話內容：

保安局局長：各位香港市民，各位記者朋友，大家好。我剛剛出席了由香港消防處主辦的國際水域救援技術交流會議。這個會議集合了來自內地、澳門、香港，還有來自八個亞太地區相關水域的救援專家一起進行會議，就着水域救援科技、技術和戰術進行交流。這個會議一共有四天，首兩天在香港，之後兩天會在內地進行一些觀察活動。

我也想趁這個機會談談，我昨天擬根據《維護國家安全條例》發出命令，禁止兩個組織在香港運作，這兩個組織是「香港議會」和「香港民主建國聯盟」。我是考慮過相關證據，覺得作出這個禁令是維護國家安全的必須行動。我亦會根據法例，在我作出最後決定前，讓他們作出申述。

這兩個組織建立的目的就是為了分裂國家和顛覆國家政權。他們推行所謂「自主」，即是「港獨」，以及推行所謂「香港憲法」，其實這就是破壞國家《憲法》的根本制度，亦破壞香港和國家的政權機關。「香港議會」較早前有19名成員離開了香港、潛逃了，我們已經通緝他們，亦根據《維護國家安全條例》將他們列為指明潛逃者。另外，他們在香港的一位成員也在較早時因涉及煽動意圖而被我們拘捕和檢控，並被判刑12個月。另外，「香港民主建國聯盟」其中四個香港成員也是被我們以「串謀分裂國家」罪拘捕並檢控，現正等候法庭程序。我也理解到這個組織的其中一個活躍成員因為呼籲人們在接着的選舉（立法會換屆選舉）中投白票和不投票，而被廉政公署以《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》通緝。

我想指出，當我正式宣布這兩個組織成為受禁組織後，任何人以這些組織的成員（身分）行事，或者意圖煽動其他人加入這些組織，或者參與這兩個組織的任何活動，或者提供任何援助，都是違法。最高判刑是罰款港幣100萬元和判監14年。我希望大家切勿以身試法。

我也想指出，除了我剛才提到有些人煽動他人投白票或不投票，違反《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》，也有些人是死心不息，想破壞這次選舉或者宣傳選舉活動的進行。到目前為止，有35宗相關罪案，大部分都是與刑事毀壞有關，即是毀壞一些宣傳物品。到目前為止，已經有29人被拘捕。我也想在此再重申一次，任何人如果以任何方法企圖影響選舉，我們必須和必定會嚴正執法。

我想講講，十二月七日的選舉，其實是彰顯了國務院在二○二一年發布的《「一國兩制」下香港的民主發展》白皮書的精神，透過完善選舉制度達致良政善治以及推進香港的發展。所以，我在此呼籲所有香港的合資格選民在十二月七日出來行使你們的權利，以及履行你們作為公民的義務，出來投票，選出愛國愛港、能夠為香港發展貢獻力量的人出任議員。多謝各位。

記者︰關於「香港議會」和「建國聯盟」禁止運作，可否說說當局有沒有發現有任何人在香港暗地裏運行或煽動其他人去做這件事？實行了這個措施之後，期望可以達到甚麼效果或增加哪方面的阻嚇力？另外，剛才也提到關於選舉有一些破壞宣傳單張、偷旗的罪行出現，當局有沒有研究過他們有甚麼企圖？有沒有組織性？又或者是否如你之前所說，一些死心不息的分子想破壞，或都是一些個別案件為主？另外，有關抹黑和杯葛投票，很多都是一些外籍人士或在國外的人士在呼籲，有沒有措施可以令他們停止這做法，或者當局有甚麼計劃阻止這些事繼續發生？

保安局局長︰剛才你提到該兩個組織其中之一的「香港議會」，我們已經就一個在香港的成員以「煽動意圖」罪將他拘捕和成功檢控，判刑12個月。至於另一個組織，即「香港民主建國聯盟」，也有四名在香港的成員已被我們以「串謀分裂國家」罪拘捕。我在此再次強調，任何人從事這些違法活動，我們必定嚴正執法。剛才我提到，到目前為止，有35宗針對選舉的刑事毁壞或偷宣傳品的罪案，共拘捕29人。到目前為止，我們相信這些案件都是個別案件，但無論你出於甚麼意圖，企圖影響選舉的話，我們必然嚴正執法，有關人士亦必然要面對法律後果。

記者︰近期社交平台上看見有人付款鼓勵投票，這做法有否違法？近期中日關係緊張，警方高層選擇不出席日本駐港總領事館舉辦的活動，那是甚麼活動？

保安局局長︰首先我想說說，《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》對於有甚麼行為可以做、甚麼不可以做，已說得很清楚，我們會根據法例行事。另外，對於我們和日本的關係，行政長官亦說得很清楚，特區政府必然會跟隨國家的政策處理，我們亦認為日本的相關行為是不適合，我們也會根據國家的政策決定如何處理下一步。

記者︰局方表示已向該兩個組織發書面通知，在局方作最終決定前作申述，申述方面會否有限期？

保安局局長︰今次我們給予七天時間讓他們作出申述。當然如果他們認為有需要，可延長時間，我們也會考慮是否合理，再決定是否要延長時間。多謝各位。"

"Speech by SCST at opening ceremony of ""Play, Pose & Pixel"" Digital Fashion Exhibition (English only)",2025-11-25 12:40,2025-11-25 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500347.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the opening ceremony of the ""Play, Pose & Pixel"" Digital Fashion Exhibition today (November 25):

Madame Drulhe (Consul General of France in Hong Kong and Macau, Ms Christile Drulhe), Mr Serge Carreira (representative of the Paris Fashion Week), Joseph (Chairman of the Hong Kong Design Centre, Mr Joseph Lo), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Bonjour. Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you at the opening ceremony of the ""Play, Pose & Pixel"" Digital Fashion Exhibition, curated by the Hong Kong Design Centre and our dear friends from the Paris Fashion Week.

  Digital fashion has surged in popularity over the past decade and is now integrated across the entire fashion chain - from design to manufacturing and retail. It saves time and materials in sample production, enables business without physical products, and transcends geographic limits with virtual try-ons. Without a doubt, it is a key trend shaping the future of fashion.

  I am delighted that the Hong Kong Design Centre is presenting this ""Play, Pose & Pixel"" Digital Fashion Exhibition in partnership with the prestigious Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, in short FHCM, the organiser of the Paris Fashion Week. This exhibition explores pioneering fashion technology and showcases the boundless possibilities of digital fashion. In fact, it stands as one of the most anticipated highlights of this year's Hong Kong Fashion Fest.

  The curatorial team behind the exhibition, FabriX, continues to surprise and inspire by merging augmented reality (AR) with the latest fashion. Today, they return with their iconic AR Try-on Kiosk, allowing users to try on digital outfits. Even if you are as short as me, you can look really good in their kiosks trying on the latest fashion. It captures selfies and collects photos of their favourite virtual fashion pieces.

  Among the seven designers featured in the virtual experience, three are emerging local Hong Kong talents, showcasing the vibrant creativity of Hong Kong's new generation of designers. This also reflects our commitment to nurturing local creators and elevating them onto the global stage.

  Before arriving in Hong Kong, the exhibition had already made a presence at the Paris Fashion Week this past September. Some of the works you see here today were first shown in Paris, including collaborations between international designers and multidisciplinary artists. Through photography, dance, 3D animation and AI, these pieces blur the lines between fashion, performance and digital arts.

  Now, for the first time, the exhibition is staged in Hong Kong. I encourage you all to explore it fully and immerse yourselves in the dynamic world of digital fashion.

  The next two weeks will be filled with fashion events across the city. Curated by various partner organisations and sponsored by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency, the Hong Kong Fashion Fest will run until December 7, offering a rich series of design experiences in multiple locations. I warmly invite you to be part of this exciting journey.

  My congratulations to the Hong Kong Design Centre for bringing this visionary fashion event to life - infusing fresh energy and innovation into our fashion scene and showcasing the achievements of Hong Kong designers. My thanks also go to the FHCM for their partnership and dedication to advancing digital fashion, inspiring the future of the fashion industry.

  Last but not least, I wish this exhibition every success. And to everyone in the audience, stay joyful and glamorous. Thank you very much."
按揭證券公司發行創紀錄的253億港元公募基準債券,2025-11-25 12:05,2025-11-25 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500282.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港按揭證券有限公司（按揭證券公司）今日（十一月二十五日）宣布，在其300億美元中期債券發行計劃下成功發行總額為253億港元（或等值33億美元）的多幣種公募基準債券。

經過一系列卓有成效的投資者路演，是次債券於二○二五年十一月十八日在香港以簿記建檔方式發行並定價。本次具有里程碑意義的發行是按揭證券公司有史以來規模最大的公募債券發行，打破了按揭證券公司於二○二四年十月創下的紀錄，當時發行了第三批社會責任債券，金額達238億港元等值。

此次發行的多幣種基準債券包括四筆分別為100億港元2年期、50億元人民幣3年期和10億美元5年期傳統債券，以及20億港元30年期社會責任債券。此次發行受到多元化的優質本地、南向債券通及國際機構投資者熱烈追捧，其中包括多邊開發銀行、政府相關基金、銀行、保險公司、強積金及退休基金、資產管理公司及私人銀行。債券發行最高峰期的合計認購金額約800億港元等值，最終配售給約250家機構投資者。

是次發行的30年期港元社會責任債券不僅是香港有史以來規模最大的30年期港元債券，也是亞太地區首筆用於支持安老按揭計劃以為香港長者提供必要融資的社會責任債券。有關發行的主要條款列載於附件。

安老按揭計劃是「HKMC退休3寶」之一，旨在為長者業主提供退休規劃方案，讓他們可以釋放其物業價值，為他們提供額外現金流，從而幫助他們在退休後維持生活質素，並滿足醫療保健和其他生活需要。截至二○二五年十月底，按揭證券公司在安老按揭計劃下收到8 776宗申請，平均物業估值約為550萬港元，平均每月年金約15,900港元。借款人的平均年齡為69歲。

香港金融管理局副總裁兼按揭證券公司執行董事李達志表示：「這次具有里程碑意義的多幣種債券發行進一步鞏固了香港作為亞洲領先的國際債券發行中心和首屈一指的離岸人民幣業務中心的地位。本次債券通過各種幣種和不同年期發行，進一步突顯了按揭證券公司在促進公募債券市場發展的角色，為其他發債機構提供了連接本地、中國內地及海外機構投資者的機會。」

按揭證券公司執行董事兼總裁鮑克運表示：「此次創紀錄的債券發行已證明其在吸引新投資者進入香港資本市場方面成效顯著，也印證了投資者對香港及按揭證券公司的堅定信心。此外，這次歷來第一筆用於支持安老按揭貸款的社會責任債券不僅促進了為長者提供可持續融資和普惠金融，也為香港的退休規劃市場發展和銀髮經濟作出了貢獻。」

按揭證券公司衷心感謝聯席全球協調行、聯席賬簿管理行、聯席牽頭行及聯席結構銀行團隊合共29家本地及國際金融機構的專業意見及廣大支持，使本次發行得以成功。參與發行的金融機構名單載於附件。

是次社會責任債券是根據按揭證券公司的《社會責任、綠色及可持續金融框架》（框架）發行。有關框架及第二方意見、本次社會責任債券的發行前第二方意見報告的詳情，請瀏覽www.hkmc.com.hk/chi/investor_relations/sustainable_finance.html。"

HKMC's record HK$25.3 billion public benchmark bond issuance,2025-11-25 12:05,2025-11-25 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500281.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) announced today (November 25) the successful issuance of its multi-currency public benchmark bonds totalling HK$25.3 billion (or US$3.3 billion equivalent) (Issuance) under its US$30 billion Medium Term Note Programme.

Following a series of effective investor roadshows, the Issuance was book-built and priced in Hong Kong on November 18, 2025. The landmark Issuance was the HKMC's largest-ever public bond offering, breaking its own record set in October 2024 when it launched its third social bonds of HK$23.8 billion equivalent.

The multi-currency benchmark bond issuance with four tranches comprises HK$10 billion 2-year, CNH 5 billion 3-year and US$1 billion 5-year bonds in conventional bond format; and a 30-year HK$2 billion bond in social bond format. The Issuance was well received by a diverse group of high-quality local, Southbound Bond Connect and international institutional investors, including multilateral development banks, government-related funds, banks, insurance companies, MPF and pension funds, asset management companies and private banks, with a combined peak orderbook of around HK$80 billion equivalent and final allocation to around 250 accounts.

The 30-year Hong Kong dollar (HKD) social bond tranche is the largest-ever 30-year HKD bond issuance in Hong Kong, and also the first-ever social bond issuance in Asia Pacific with proceeds being used to support the HKMC's Reverse Mortgage Programme (RMP) that provides essential financing for the elderly in Hong Kong. Major terms of the Issuance are highlighted in the Annex.

The RMP is one of the ""HKMC Retire 3"" products offering retirement planning solution for elderly homeowners to unlock the values of their properties to provide a supplementary cashflow, thereby helping the elderly to maintain their quality of life during retirement, and to meet healthcare and other livelihood needs. As at end-October 2025, the HKMC has received 8 776 applications under the programme with an average property value of around HK$5.5 million and average monthly payout of around HK$15,900. The average age of borrowers was 69 years old.

  Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Executive Director of the HKMCMr Howard Leesaid, ""This landmark multi-currency bond issuance has further solidified Hong Kong's position as Asia's leading international bond issuance hub and the premier offshore Renminbi business centre. The Issuance also further underscored the HKMC's role in fostering the development of public bond market across various currencies and tenors, paving the way for other issuers to better connect with local, Chinese Mainland and overseas investors.""

  Executive Director and the Chief Executive Officer of the HKMC, Mr Colin Pou,said, ""This record-breaking bond issuance has proven to be highly effective in bringing new investors to the Hong Kong capital market. It was also a testament to investors' unwavering confidence in Hong Kong and the HKMC. Moreover, the first-ever social bond tranche dedicated for reverse mortgage loans not only promoted sustainable financing and financial inclusion for the elderly, but also made contribution to the development of retirement planning market and silver economy in Hong Kong.""

The HKMC appreciates the professional advice and tremendous support from the Joint Global Coordinators, Joint Bookrunners, Joint Lead Managers and the Joint Structuring Banks, which comprised a total of 29 local and international financial institutions, in making the Issuance successful. The list of participated financial institutions is set out at the Annex.

The social bond tranche was issued pursuant to the HKMC's Social, Green and Sustainability Financing Framework (SGS Framework). Details of the SGS Framework, the Second-Party Opinion for the SGS Framework, and the Pre-issuance Second-Party Opinion report for the transaction are available at www.hkmc.com.hk/eng/investor_relations/sustainable_finance.html."
Adjustment in ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations in December 2025,2025-11-25 12:05,2025-11-25 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/25/P2025112500313.htm,"  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) today (November 25) announced an adjustment to the auto-LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations from December 1 to December 31, 2025, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts for dedicated LPG filling stations.

  A department spokesman said that the adjustment on December 1, 2025, would reflect the movement of the LPG international price in November 2025. The adjusted auto-LPG ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations would range from $3.05 to $3.96 per litre, amounting to a decrease of $0.07 to $0.08 per litre.

  The spokesman said that the auto-LPG ceiling prices were adjusted according to a pricing formula specified in the contracts. The formula comprises two elements - the LPG international price and the LPG operating price. The LPG international price refers to the LPG international price of the preceding month. The LPG operating price is adjusted on February 1 and June 1 annually according to the average movement of the Composite Consumer Price Index and the Nominal Wage Index.

  The auto-LPG ceiling prices for respective dedicated LPG filling stations in December 2025 are as follows:

Deputy Director Xu Zhongshun (Deputy Director General of the National Fire and Rescue Administration), distinguished guests, respected colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. On behalf of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), it is my great pleasure to welcome you all to Hong Kong and to the opening ceremony of the International Aquatic Rescue Technical Exchange (IARTX) 2025.

I extend a particularly warm welcome to delegation members from our national rescue teams, the Macao SAR (Special Administrative Region) rescue team, and distinguished experts from our neighbouring countries and regions across Asia Pacific. Your presence today exemplifies a shared commitment to advancing regional collaboration in disaster prevention, response and rescue.

In recent years, the realities of climate change have become ever more apparent, with extreme weather events occurring more frequently and with greater intensity, including here in Hong Kong. Against this backdrop, the HKSAR Government remains unwavering in its dedication to enhancing disaster preparedness, strengthening emergency response capabilities, and safeguarding public safety.

Aquatic rescue is among the most challenging and high-risk domains of emergency operations. Through the technical exchange platform provided by the IARTX, experts and frontline practitioners from across our region will come together for practical training, live demonstrations, thematic presentations and site visits. These valuable interactions are essential for deepening mutual understanding, sharing best practices and fostering robust operational co-ordination.

Such collaboration does more than enhance our technical capabilities, it forges the spirit of solidarity so vital in times of crisis. The knowledge and experience gained through this exchange will further empower the Hong Kong Fire Services Department to contribute effectively to our national strategies on disaster management, and will help us deepen international partnerships to better protect lives in our region.

The HKSAR Government is also steadfast in developing Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology hub. In the field of aquatic rescue, we actively promote the integration of advanced technologies, such as underwater remotely operated vehicles and side-scan sonar rescue tools, so as to enable our rescuers to work more safely, efficiently, and precisely.

Today's gathering vividly demonstrates that disaster risk knows no boundaries, and neither should our efforts to address it. Co-operation, co-ordination and cohesion are the pillars of collective resilience. I am confident that, through the collaborative spirit of the IARTX, we will forge even stronger partnerships, further strengthen our capabilities, and secure a safer future for our communities.

In closing, I wish the IARTX 2025 every success, and hope that all participants find the coming days to be both fruitful and inspiring. Thank you."

The performance featured Hong Kong-based Korean-American violinist Ruda Lee and the city's innovative ANIMA Ensemble, led by dynamic young Hong Kong conductor Vivian Ip, who is Associate Conductor of the Hong Kong Sinfonietta and the third-prize winner of the 2025 International Ferenc Fricsay Conducting Competition.

Welcoming the New York debut of the ANIMA Ensemble with Lee, the Director of the New York ETO, Ms Maisie Ho, said initiatives like this are at the heart of Hong Kong's mission to be a dynamic world-class hub where Eastern and Western cultures meet, create, and inspire.

""We are proud to provide a global platform for our extraordinary artists to share their vision with the world. This concert is a testament to the transcendent creativity emanating from Hong Kong,"" said Ms Ho. The New York ETO is the government partner of the tour.

The concert reimagined Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" across centuries and cultures through today's climate lens, exploring nature's influence on sound and emotion, and culminating in a vibrant tribute to Hong Kong's defining season - summer.

Extending the spirit of creativity and underscoring Hong Kong's commitment to global cultural exchanges, the programme also featured the premieres of the winning composition from a Rutgers University competition, ""Fool's Spring"", by Brandon DiNatale, and ""The Memory of Snow"" by Dr Scott Ordway, Associate Professor of Music and Head of Composition at Rutgers.

In addition to the Carnegie Hall performance, Lee and Ip conducted two workshop sessions at Rutgers on November 18 and 19, focusing on music sharing and artistic exchanges, with an emphasis on educational and creative dialogue between composers and performers."
