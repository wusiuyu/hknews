各位嘉賓、各位同事、各位朋友：

大家早晨！今年六月三十日，是《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》公布實施五周年的重要日子。今日，我非常高興來到消防及救護學院，與各位一同參與這個別具意義的紀律部隊及青少年團體升旗儀式。

《香港國安法》的公布實施，為香港帶來一個關鍵轉折點；為維護國家主權、安全與發展利益，以及為香港特區的長治久安，奠定了堅實的法律基礎。

在剛剛舉行的升旗儀式上，在場每一位朋友都看着迎風飄揚的國旗，聽着鏗鏘激昂的國歌。我深深感受到，大家都由心愛護我們的國家，肩負着維護國家安全的責任和使命。

五年前，香港經歷了前所未有的黑暴亂局，暴力事件不斷，市民在動亂中惶恐度日，法治核心價值遭受嚴重衝擊。《香港國安法》的公布實施，迅速有力地止暴制亂，徹底扭轉了香港的危局，令香港的法治更健全、市民權利更受保障、營商環境亦得以改善。

《香港國安法》不單止是定海神針，更是一面守護香港的堅實盾牌，守護「一國兩制」行穩致遠，保障了香港市民的根本福祉。

五年來，香港司法機構嚴格依法審理危害國家安全的案件，展現法律的公正與權威。《香港國安法》與去年三月生效的《維護國家安全條例》渾然一體、兼容互補，為香港建立一套全面而高效的維護國家安全法律制度，保障市民依法享有的權利和自由，亦讓社會能夠專注拼經濟、謀發展、惠民生。

安全與發展密不可分，只有在確保高水平安全的基礎上，才能實現經濟和社會的高質量發展。面對複雜多變的國際形勢，外部勢力的圍堵打壓，國家安全風險可以突如其來，我們絕對不能掉以輕心，必須保持高度警惕。

維護國家安全只有進行時，沒有完成時；亦是每一位香港市民的責任和義務，更是整個社會的共同使命。特區政府會持續完善國安法律體系，築牢長治久安的制度保障。我們亦會繼續全面準確貫徹「一國兩制」方針，堅定不移地維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，確保香港長期繁榮穩定。

今日在場的各大紀律部隊一直以來堅定不移地貫徹落實總體國家安全觀，致力確保國家安全和社會穩定；而各位青少年是國家的未來棟樑，是香港發展的重要支撐。我希望全社會繼續攜手同心，合力守護國家安全，為國家的繁榮穩定、為香港的持續發展貢獻力量。

最後，我祝願國家繁榮昌盛，香港再創輝煌，各位身體健康，生活愉快。多謝各位！"

政務司司長出席《香港國安法》公布實施五周年紀律部隊及青少年團體升旗儀式致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-06-22 11:14,2025-06-22 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/22/P2025062200309.htm,"​以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（六月二十二日）在《香港國安法》公布實施五周年紀律部隊及青少年團體升旗儀式的致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位同事、各位朋友：

大家早晨！今年六月三十日，是《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》公布實施五周年的重要日子。今日，我非常高興來到消防及救護學院，與各位一同參與這個別具意義的紀律部隊及青少年團體升旗儀式。

《香港國安法》的公布實施，為香港帶來一個關鍵轉折點；為維護國家主權、安全與發展利益，以及為香港特區的長治久安，奠定了堅實的法律基礎。

在剛剛舉行的升旗儀式上，在場每一位朋友都看着迎風飄揚的國旗，聽着鏗鏘激昂的國歌。我深深感受到，大家都由心愛護我們的國家，肩負着維護國家安全的責任和使命。

五年前，香港經歷了前所未有的黑暴亂局，暴力事件不斷，市民在動亂中惶恐度日，法治核心價值遭受嚴重衝擊。《香港國安法》的公布實施，迅速有力地止暴制亂，徹底扭轉了香港的危局，令香港的法治更健全、市民權利更受保障、營商環境亦得以改善。

《香港國安法》不單止是定海神針，更是一面守護香港的堅實盾牌，守護「一國兩制」行穩致遠，保障了香港市民的根本福祉。

五年來，香港司法機構嚴格依法審理危害國家安全的案件，展現法律的公正與權威。《香港國安法》與去年三月生效的《維護國家安全條例》渾然一體、兼容互補，為香港建立一套全面而高效的維護國家安全法律制度，保障市民依法享有的權利和自由，亦讓社會能夠專注拼經濟、謀發展、惠民生。

安全與發展密不可分，只有在確保高水平安全的基礎上，才能實現經濟和社會的高質量發展。面對複雜多變的國際形勢，外部勢力的圍堵打壓，國家安全風險可以突如其來，我們絕對不能掉以輕心，必須保持高度警惕。

維護國家安全只有進行時，沒有完成時；亦是每一位香港市民的責任和義務，更是整個社會的共同使命。特區政府會持續完善國安法律體系，築牢長治久安的制度保障。我們亦會繼續全面準確貫徹「一國兩制」方針，堅定不移地維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，確保香港長期繁榮穩定。

今日在場的各大紀律部隊一直以來堅定不移地貫徹落實總體國家安全觀，致力確保國家安全和社會穩定；而各位青少年是國家的未來棟樑，是香港發展的重要支撐。我希望全社會繼續攜手同心，合力守護國家安全，為國家的繁榮穩定、為香港的持續發展貢獻力量。

最後，我祝願國家繁榮昌盛，香港再創輝煌，各位身體健康，生活愉快。多謝各位！"

"SCED promotes Hong Kong's advantages as wine and liquor trading hub in Bordeaux, France (with photos)",2025-06-22 09:00,2025-06-22 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/22/P2025062200006.htm,"The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, continued his visit to Bordeaux, France, to promote the advantages of Hong Kong as a wine and liquor trading hub to the local trade.

On June 20 (France time), Mr Yau held a business roundtable and met with representatives of the trade of Bordeaux wine, Cognac and Armagnac to exchange views on the latest developments of the trade and enhance co-operation on promoting wine and liquor trading.

Mr Yau first shared with the trade the business opportunities brought about by the strong growth in the demand of wine in the vast market of Asia Pacific. He said market research revealed that China's wine market generated approximately US$31 billion in revenue in 2024 and is projected to reach US$54 billion in 2030, reflecting an annual growth rate of almost 10 per cent. He added that with Hong Kong's wine duty abolished in 2008, the city is now an international wine trading hub and one of the world's top three wine auction centres.

Turning to liquor, Mr Yau said that France remains one of Hong Kong's top liquor trading partners, In 2024, Hong Kong imported US$831 million worth of liquor, and France was Hong Kong's second-largest import market, accounting for 30 per cent of the total. Brandy continued to be a leading category, particularly through high-end retail channels catering to the Mainland market.

Mr Yau added that last October, Hong Kong took another step by introducing a two-tier liquor duty system under which the duty rate was reduced from 100 per cent to 10 per cent for the portion above HK$200. As a ""super connector"" linking the East and West, Hong Kong with its strategic location and unique advantages plays a pivotal role in the global liquor trade as a gateway to the fast-growing Asia and Mainland markets. Between 2013 and 2023, imports of spirits in Asia grew 79.3 per cent, a significantly faster rate than the global increase of 42 per cent in the same period. The Mainland is now the third-largest importer of Cognac.

Mr Yau added that Hong Kong's signature events, such as the Hong Kong International Wine & Spirits Fair and the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival, along with biennial events such as ProWine Hong Kong and Vinexpo Asia, provide French producers with unparalleled platforms to promote their brands to international buyers, distributors and liquor enthusiasts.

Mr Yau said that coupled with its premier location, free flow of capital and free port status, Hong Kong, as the world's freest economy and the third-most competitive economy globally, is the best partner for the Bordeaux wine and liquor sector to tap into the tremendous opportunities in the Asia market, notably the Mainland.

On June 21 (France time), Mr Yau took the opportunity to visit vineyards in Bordeaux to learn about their operations and promote Hong Kong's position as Asia's wine and liquor trading hub."
​商經局局長在法國波爾多推廣香港作為葡萄酒及烈酒貿易樞紐優勢（附圖）,2025-06-22 09:00,2025-06-22 09:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/22/P2025062200010.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺繼續在法國波爾多的訪問行程，向當地業界推廣香港作為葡萄酒及烈酒貿易樞紐的優勢。

六月二十日（法國時間），丘應樺與波爾多的葡萄酒、干邑和雅文邑業界代表舉行商業圓桌會議和會面，就酒業的最新發展交換意見，並促進合作以推動葡萄酒和烈酒貿易。

丘應樺與業界分享亞太區龐大市場的強勁葡萄酒需求增長所帶來的商機。他指出，市場研究顯示，在二○二四年中國葡萄酒市場的收入約為310億美元，預計二○三○年將增至540億美元，每年增長約一成。他續說，自二○○八年取消葡萄酒稅項，香港現已成為國際葡萄酒貿易樞紐及全球三大葡萄酒拍賣交易中心之一。

烈酒方面，丘應樺指法國一直是香港最大的烈酒貿易夥伴之一，二○二四年，香港進口總值8.31億美元烈酒，而法國是第二大進口市場，佔進口總值30%。拔蘭地繼續是最主要類別，特別是經服務內地市場為主的高端零售渠道進口。

他續說，去年十月，香港更進一步引進雙層烈酒稅制，把進口價200港元以上部分的稅率由100%減至10%。作為聯通東、西方的「超級連繫人」，香港憑藉其戰略位置和獨特優勢，是進入正迅速發展的亞洲和內地市場的門戶，在全球烈酒貿易扮演關鍵角色。在二○一三年至二○二三年期間，亞洲進口烈酒產品錄得79.3%增幅，遠較同期全球增長42%急速。目前，內地是干邑的第三大進口地。

丘應樺表示，香港的品牌活動，包括香港國際美酒展和香港美酒佳餚巡禮，以及兩年一度的活動例如ProWine Hong Kong和Vinexpo Asia，均為法國酒商提供無可比擬的平台，向國際買家、分銷商和烈酒愛好者推廣其品牌。

他指，香港作為全球最自由經濟體和第三位最具競爭力經濟體，加上優越地理位置、資金自由進出和自由港地位，是波爾多葡萄酒和烈酒業界拓展亞洲市場，尤其內地市場龐大機遇的最佳夥伴。

丘應樺於六月二十一日（法國時間）參觀波爾多多個酒莊，了解它們的運作，並推廣香港作為亞洲葡萄酒和烈酒貿易樞紐的地位。"

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

論壇開幕典禮在上午舉行，邀得中央港澳工作辦公室主任、國務院港澳事務辦公室主任夏寶龍擔任主禮嘉賓並發表主旨致辭。香港特別行政區行政長官、香港特別行政區維護國家安全委員會主席李家超也在典禮上發表主旨致辭。

中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任、香港特別行政區維護國家安全委員會國家安全事務顧問周霽；全國人民代表大會常務委員會（全國人大常委會）香港特別行政區基本法委員會副主任、全國人大常委會法制工作委員會副主任張勇；中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署署長董經緯；外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署特派員崔建春，以及中國人民解放軍駐香港部隊司令員彭京堂少將亦在典禮上致辭。

夏寶龍主任在致辭時表示，五年來的實踐證明《香港國安法》是捍衞「一國兩制」、維護香港繁榮穩定的「守護神」，是一部具有重大歷史意義和現實意義的好法律。他強調，香港維護國家安全面臨的形勢仍然複雜嚴峻，需要牢牢把握「一國兩制」下維護國家安全的實踐要求，維護和鞏固香港來之不易的良好局面。香港內外環境正在發生深刻變化，必須把維護國家安全貫穿「一國兩制」實踐的全過程，必須確保特別行政區管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中，必須做到維護安全和推動發展都堅定不移，必須切實保障香港居民人權自由，必須保持香港的獨特地位和優勢。

夏寶龍主任說香港特區政府和社會各界必須團結一致、擔當作為，充分發揮「一國兩制」制度優勢，並把握四個要點：一是貫徹總體國家安全觀，以高水平安全護航高質量發展；二是發揮香港內聯外通獨特優勢，以開放促進高質量發展；三是善用香港法治「金字招牌」，以法治保障高質量發展；四是維護好行政主導體制，提升特別行政區治理水平，以改革推動高質量發展。

夏寶龍主任最後表示，《香港國安法》的制定實施，是「一國兩制」實踐進程中的大事件，已經載入史冊。展望未來，這部法律必將護航「一國兩制」乘風破浪、行穩致遠，讓香港在強國建設、民族復興偉業中創造新的更大輝煌。

李家超在致辭時感謝夏寶龍主任深情回顧《香港國安法》在過去五年對回復香港穩定、實踐「一國兩制」行穩致遠的積極意義，並為香港未來的安全與發展指明方向。李家超提出四大重點，指香港特區要全面準確貫徹「一國兩制」方針，深入踐行「總體國家安全觀」；堅守法治根基，發揮香港國際化優勢；珍惜穩定局面，把握發展機遇；以及提升傳統優勢，聚力改革創新，繼續維護好國家安全，也要用好穩定的局面，全面拼經濟、謀發展、惠民生，實現以人民為中心的目的。

李家超指出，有「一國兩制」的制度保障，以及《香港國安法》保駕護航和《維護國家安全條例》融合互補，香港的發展和改革定可不斷穩步推進，發揮更大力量，為中國強國建設、民族復興偉業作出更大貢獻。

維護國家安全的使命感和自覺性有賴年輕一代傳承，方能不斷走深走實。論壇的其中一個環節是主題為「五載新希望國安我擔當」的表演，由約180名不同年齡層的學生演出。特區政府一直致力推動國家安全教育，律政司、保安局和教育局等先後舉辦多項活動，提高年輕一代的國家安全意識。保安局青少年制服團隊國安問答比賽、全港學界國家安全常識挑戰賽2024/25和「香港國安法——守護與希望」社交媒體帖文創作比賽的頒獎典禮均在論壇上舉行，表揚得獎的青少年。

「《香港國安法》護遠航創未來」啟動儀式緊接頒獎典禮後舉行，由夏寶龍主任聯同李家超、周霽、張勇、董經緯、崔建春、彭京堂少將及林定國主持啟動儀式，象徵香港社會在《香港國安法》的保駕護航下，踏上由治及興的新征程。"
HKSAR Government organises 5th Anniversary of Promulgation & Implementation of Hong Kong National Security Law Forum (with photos),2025-06-21 23:53,2025-06-22 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/21/P2025062100892.htm," This year marks the 5th anniversary of the promulgation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). The law complements and integrates seamlessly with the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance which was enacted last year, collectively forming a legal great wall to safeguard national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). At this significant moment in time, the HKSAR Government has organised the 5th Anniversary of Promulgation & Implementation of Hong Kong National Security Law Forum to look back and ahead to the development of the HKSAR's legal system in safeguarding national security, with a view to enhancing the understanding of the laws on safeguarding national security among various sectors and raising public awareness on national security.

 The Opening Ceremony of the Forum was held this morning. âThe Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xia Baolong, was invited to officiate at the ceremony and deliver a keynote speech. The Chief Executive of the HKSAR and the Chairman of the Hong Kong National Security Committee, Mr John Lee, also delivered a keynote speech at the ceremony.

 The Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR and National Security Adviser to the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR, Mr Zhou Ji; Vice-Chairperson of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Deputy Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Mr Zhang Yong; the Head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, Mr Dong Jingwei; the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR, Mr Cui Jianchun; and the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison, Major General Peng Jingtang, also delivered speeches at the ceremony.

 Mr Xia said in his speech that the implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven the law to be a ""guardian"" in defending the ""one country, two systems"" principle and in safeguarding the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. It is a good law of great historical significance and immediate importance, he said, stressing that the situation facing Hong Kong in safeguarding national security is still complex and grave, and that it is necessary to grasp the requirements of safeguarding national security under the ""one country, two systems"" principle to maintain and consolidate the hard-won situation that Hong Kong is now enjoying. Profound changes are taking place in the internal and external environments of Hong Kong. Hong Kong must safeguard national security in the full process of implementing the ""one country, two systems"" principle; ensure that the governance of the HKSAR is firmly in the hands of the patriots; be steadfast in safeguarding security and promoting development; effectively protect the human rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people, and maintain Hong Kong's unique position and advantages.

 Mr Xia said that the HKSAR Government and all sectors of society must unite and take responsibility to give full play to the institutional advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and grasp four key points: first, fully implement a holistic approach to national security to safeguard high-quality development with high-level security; second, leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages in connecting the Mainland and the world to promote high-quality development through openness; third, utilise Hong Kong's ""golden reputation"" vis-à-vis the rule of law to safeguard high-quality development; and fourth, uphold Hong Kong's executive-led system to improve governance of the SAR and promote high-quality development through reform.

 Mr Xia concluded by saying that the enactment and implementation of the HKNSL is a major event in the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and has already made its mark in history. Looking to the future, the HKNSL will surely safeguard the steady and far-reaching journey of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, enabling Hong Kong to achieve new and greater accomplishments in the grand endeavor of building a strong nation and realising national rejuvenation.

 In his speech, Mr Lee thanked Mr Xia for his heartfelt review of the positive significance of the HKNSL in restoring Hong Kong's stability and implementing the ""one country, two systems"" principle in the past five years, and for providing direction for Hong Kong's future security and development. Mr Lee put forward four main points, stressing that the HKSAR must fully and accurately implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle and thoroughly adopt a holistic approach to national security; adhere to the solid foundation of the rule of law and leverage Hong Kong's international advantages; cherish the stable situation and seize development opportunities; and enhance traditional advantages, focusing on reform and innovation. He said that the HKSAR should continue to safeguard national security and make good use of the stable situation to focus its efforts on developing a vibrant economy, achieving prosperous development and improving people's livelihoods to realise people-centered development.

 Mr Lee said that under the institutional protection of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and the safeguarding of the HKNSL, which complements and integrates seamlessly with the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, Hong Kong's development and reform will surely continue to advance steadily, thereby making greater contributions to the nation in the building of a great country and advancing toward national rejuvenation.

 The young generation plays an important role in passing down the sense of mission and self-awareness on safeguarding national security for it to be deeply rooted and realised. One of the sessions of the forum was a performance with the theme of ""Five Years of a New Horizon - Our Commitment to Safeguarding National Security"", which was performed by more than 180 students of different ages. The HKSAR Government has been committed to promoting national security education.

香港特區政府舉辦《香港國安法》公布實施五周年論壇,2025-06-21 23:53,2025-06-22 00:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/21/P2025062100889.htm,"今年是《香港國安法》公布實施五周年，《香港國安法》與去年制定的《維護國家安全條例》兼容互補，共同構築起香港特別行政區（特區）維護國家安全的法律長城。在此別具意義的時刻，香港特區政府今日（六月二十一日）特別舉辦《香港國安法》公布實施五周年論壇，回顧並展望香港特區維護國家安全法律制度的發展，提高各界對有關法律的理解和提升市民的國家安全意識。

論壇開幕典禮在上午舉行，邀得中央港澳工作辦公室主任、國務院港澳事務辦公室主任夏寶龍擔任主禮嘉賓並發表主旨致辭。香港特別行政區行政長官、香港特別行政區維護國家安全委員會主席李家超也在典禮上發表主旨致辭。

中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任、香港特別行政區維護國家安全委員會國家安全事務顧問周霽；全國人民代表大會常務委員會（全國人大常委會）香港特別行政區基本法委員會副主任、全國人大常委會法制工作委員會副主任張勇；中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署署長董經緯；外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署特派員崔建春，以及中國人民解放軍駐香港部隊司令員彭京堂少將亦在典禮上致辭。

夏寶龍主任在致辭時表示，五年來的實踐證明《香港國安法》是捍衞「一國兩制」、維護香港繁榮穩定的「守護神」，是一部具有重大歷史意義和現實意義的好法律。他強調，香港維護國家安全面臨的形勢仍然複雜嚴峻，需要牢牢把握「一國兩制」下維護國家安全的實踐要求，維護和鞏固香港來之不易的良好局面。香港內外環境正在發生深刻變化，必須把維護國家安全貫穿「一國兩制」實踐的全過程，必須確保特別行政區管治權牢牢掌握在愛國者手中，必須做到維護安全和推動發展都堅定不移，必須切實保障香港居民人權自由，必須保持香港的獨特地位和優勢。

夏寶龍主任說香港特區政府和社會各界必須團結一致、擔當作為，充分發揮「一國兩制」制度優勢，並把握四個要點：一是貫徹總體國家安全觀，以高水平安全護航高質量發展；二是發揮香港內聯外通獨特優勢，以開放促進高質量發展；三是善用香港法治「金字招牌」，以法治保障高質量發展；四是維護好行政主導體制，提升特別行政區治理水平，以改革推動高質量發展。

夏寶龍主任最後表示，《香港國安法》的制定實施，是「一國兩制」實踐進程中的大事件，已經載入史冊。展望未來，這部法律必將護航「一國兩制」乘風破浪、行穩致遠，讓香港在強國建設、民族復興偉業中創造新的更大輝煌。

李家超在致辭時感謝夏寶龍主任深情回顧《香港國安法》在過去五年對回復香港穩定、實踐「一國兩制」行穩致遠的積極意義，並為香港未來的安全與發展指明方向。李家超提出四大重點，指香港特區要全面準確貫徹「一國兩制」方針，深入踐行「總體國家安全觀」；堅守法治根基，發揮香港國際化優勢；珍惜穩定局面，把握發展機遇；以及提升傳統優勢，聚力改革創新，繼續維護好國家安全，也要用好穩定的局面，全面拼經濟、謀發展、惠民生，實現以人民為中心的目的。

李家超指出，有「一國兩制」的制度保障，以及《香港國安法》保駕護航和《維護國家安全條例》融合互補，香港的發展和改革定可不斷穩步推進，發揮更大力量，為中國強國建設、民族復興偉業作出更大貢獻。

維護國家安全的使命感和自覺性有賴年輕一代傳承，方能不斷走深走實。論壇的其中一個環節是主題為「五載新希望 國安我擔當」的表演，由約180名不同年齡層的學生演出。特區政府一直致力推動國家安全教育，律政司、保安局和教育局等先後舉辦多項活動，提高年輕一代的國家安全意識。保安局青少年制服團隊國安問答比賽、全港學界國家安全常識挑戰賽2024/25和「香港國安法 ——守護與希望」社交媒體帖文創作比賽的頒獎典禮均在論壇上舉行，表揚得獎的青少年。

「《香港國安法》護遠航創未來」啟動儀式緊接頒獎典禮後舉行，由夏寶龍主任聯同李家超、周霽、張勇、董經緯、崔建春、彭京堂少將及林定國主持啟動儀式，象徵香港社會在《香港國安法》的保駕護航下，踏上由治及興的新征程。"
HKSAR Government organises 5th Anniversary of Promulgation & Implementation of Hong Kong National Security Law Forum,2025-06-21 23:53,2025-06-22 00:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/21/P2025062100892.htm," This year marks the 5th anniversary of the promulgation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). The law complements and integrates seamlessly with the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance which was enacted last year, collectively forming a legal great wall to safeguard national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). At this significant moment in time, the HKSAR Government has organised the 5th Anniversary of Promulgation & Implementation of Hong Kong National Security Law Forum to look back and ahead to the development of the HKSAR's legal system in safeguarding national security, with a view to enhancing the understanding of the laws on safeguarding national security among various sectors and raising public awareness on national security.

 The Opening Ceremony of the Forum was held this morning. âThe Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xia Baolong, was invited to officiate at the ceremony and deliver a keynote speech. The Chief Executive of the HKSAR and the Chairman of the Hong Kong National Security Committee, Mr John Lee, also delivered a keynote speech at the ceremony.

 The Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR and National Security Adviser to the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR, Mr Zhou Ji; Vice-Chairperson of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Deputy Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Mr Zhang Yong; the Head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, Mr Dong Jingwei; the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR, Mr Cui Jianchun; and the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison, Major General Peng Jingtang, also delivered speeches at the ceremony.

 Mr Xia said in his speech that the implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven the law to be a ""guardian"" in defending the ""one country, two systems"" principle and in safeguarding the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. It is a good law of great historical significance and immediate importance, he said, stressing that the situation facing Hong Kong in safeguarding national security is still complex and grave, and that it is necessary to grasp the requirements of safeguarding national security under the ""one country, two systems"" principle to maintain and consolidate the hard-won situation that Hong Kong is now enjoying. Profound changes are taking place in the internal and external environments of Hong Kong. Hong Kong must safeguard national security in the full process of implementing the ""one country, two systems"" principle; ensure that the governance of the HKSAR is firmly in the hands of the patriots; be steadfast in safeguarding security and promoting development; effectively protect the human rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people, and maintain Hong Kong's unique position and advantages.

 Mr Xia said that the HKSAR Government and all sectors of society must unite and take responsibility to give full play to the institutional advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and grasp four key points: first, fully implement a holistic approach to national security to safeguard high-quality development with high-level security; second, leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages in connecting the Mainland and the world to promote high-quality development through openness; third, utilise Hong Kong's ""golden reputation"" vis-à-vis the rule of law to safeguard high-quality development; and fourth, uphold Hong Kong's executive-led system to improve governance of the SAR and promote high-quality development through reform.

 Mr Xia concluded by saying that the enactment and implementation of the HKNSL is a major event in the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and has already made its mark in history. Looking to the future, the HKNSL will surely safeguard the steady and far-reaching journey of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, enabling Hong Kong to achieve new and greater accomplishments in the grand endeavor of building a strong nation and realising national rejuvenation.

 In his speech, Mr Lee thanked Mr Xia for his heartfelt review of the positive significance of the HKNSL in restoring Hong Kong's stability and implementing the ""one country, two systems"" principle in the past five years, and for providing direction for Hong Kong's future security and development. Mr Lee put forward four main points, stressing that the HKSAR must fully and accurately implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle and thoroughly adopt a holistic approach to national security; adhere to the solid foundation of the rule of law and leverage Hong Kong's international advantages; cherish the stable situation and seize development opportunities; and enhance traditional advantages, focusing on reform and innovation. He said that the HKSAR should continue to safeguard national security and make good use of the stable situation to focus its efforts on developing a vibrant economy, achieving prosperous development and improving people's livelihoods to realise people-centered development.

 Mr Lee said that under the institutional protection of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and the safeguarding of the HKNSL, which complements and integrates seamlessly with the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, Hong Kong's development and reform will surely continue to advance steadily, thereby making greater contributions to the nation in the building of a great country and advancing toward national rejuvenation.

 The young generation plays an important role in passing down the sense of mission and self-awareness on safeguarding national security for it to be deeply rooted and realised. One of the sessions of the forum was a performance with the theme of ""Five Years of a New Horizon - Our Commitment to Safeguarding National Security"", which was performed by more than 180 students of different ages. The HKSAR Government has been committed to promoting national security education. The Department of Justice, the Security Bureau and the Education Bureau have organised various activities to raise awareness of national security among the young generation. The awards presentation ceremonies for the Security Bureau Youth Uniformed Groups National Security Quiz Competition, the Territory-wide Inter-school National Security Knowledge Challenge 2024/25, and the ""Hong Kong National Security Law - Safeguards and Hopes"" Social Media Post Competition were held at the forum to commend the young awardees.
