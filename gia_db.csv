"Canadian multimedia theatrical film production ""The Storyville Mosquito"" to be staged at East Kowloon Cultural Centre in February (with photos)",2026-01-06 11:00,2026-01-06 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010500289.htm,"  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department's ""Cheers!"" Series will present a multimedia film production, ""The Storyville Mosquito"", from Canada in early February. The work is a multisensory feast that is simultaneously a play, a film, and a concert. Each show is performed, filmed, projected and scored in real time with detailed miniature sets, puppetry, cinematography and a musical performance, while a movie about a mosquito's musical adventure will play live in one continuous take. This one-of-a-kind family-friendly programme is also part of the East Kowloon Cultural Centre (EKCC)'s opening season lineup.

  ""The Storyville Mosquito"" is an endearing, Chaplin-esque silent theatrical cinema experience that highlights themes of dreams, inner voices, personal growth, love and friendship. It tells the story of a young mosquito who leaves his small town in the country to seek fame and fortune in a big city and fulfil his dream of playing clarinet in a legendary jazz band at a prestigious music hall. His path appears to be full of twists and turns, but he meets new companions on the bustling streets and forms sincere friendships. Driven by his passion for music and the support of friends, the mosquito moves step by step towards his dream.

  The Hong Kong programme will be performed with the support of a 14-person team. Puppeteers, foley artists, cinematographers and technicians will simultaneously manipulate 75 handcrafted puppets of various scales and move through 20 miniature sets. The whole process will be filmed in one continuous take and projected onto the screen by eight cameras. Together with a string trio, DJ and musician P-Love (born Paolo Kapunan) will play live original music scores and sound effects on turntables, keyboards and electronics depending on the scenes. At times, classical score music will be performed, while foley or cartoon sound effects will be added to certain comedic moments. Audience members will be able to watch the movie unfold on the screen while at any moment also glancing down at the stage to see the puppeteers and cinematographers creating those scenes. In essence, they will get to see the film and the making-of simultaneously, delivering an unprecedented viewing experience.

  ""The Storyville Mosquito"", created by renowned Canadian multitalented artist Kid Koala, who also directed and composed the musical score, premiered in Montreal in 2019 before touring cities in Canada, the United States, Germany, Mexico and beyond, where it was met with widespread acclaim. The production was honoured with Outstanding Touring Production honours at the Dora Awards 2023 in Canada.

  The ""Cheers!"" Series: ""The Storyville Mosquito"" by Kid Koala (Canada) will be held at 8pm on February 6 and 7 (Friday and Saturday) at the Hall of the EKCC.

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-06 06:45,2026-01-06 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010500759.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月六日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

Employers and employees should take precautions during cold weather,2026-01-06 06:45,2026-01-06 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010500758.htm,"Attention duty announcers, radio and TV stations:

Please broadcast the following special announcement immediately, and repeat it at frequent intervals when the Cold Weather Warning is in force:

  The Labour Department reminds employers that as the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions such as reminding employees who have to work outdoors or in remote areas to wear appropriately warm clothing, and make arrangements for employees to rotate from outdoor to indoor or sheltered work sites as far as possible. Employees should take note of the weather report, wear appropriately warm clothing and be mindful of their health conditions. They should notify their supervisors and seek medical help immediately if feeling unwell, such as having cold limbs and body shivering."
CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-06 06:45,2026-01-06 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/06/P2026010500760.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 6) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

 The public may also call Dial-a-Weather (1878 200) or visit thewebsite of the Hong Kong Observatoryfor the latest weather information and forecasts, or itspage on Weather Information for Senior Citizens."
Launch of open tender for new tenancy of Central Harbourfront Event Space,2026-01-05 22:04,2026-01-05 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500761.htm,"The Development Bureau (DEVB) announced today (January 5) that an open tender by the Lands Department is underway for the new tenancy of the Central Harbourfront Event Space (Event Space), which has an area of about 3.7 hectares (location plan in Annex). The tender invitation lasts for about 6 weeks and will close on February 13. The new tenancy is expected to be awarded before April and will commence in July for a fixed term of five years. The existing tennacy will expire on June 30.

A DEVB spokesperson said, ""The Government has, by way of adopting a management model involving the letting of the Event Space to external party, driven over the years the successful hosting of a multitude of large-scale signature events, such as the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival, Art Central, Clockenflap Music & Arts Festival, etc. Such management model will be maintained under the tender exercise, but there will be enhancements in two areas to further unleash the potential of the Event Space, promote mega-event economy, and strengthen venue management with a view to enhancing visitors' experiences.""

First, the DEVB has refined the tenancy terms to encourage the tenant (i.e. the successful bidder in this tender exercise) to optimise the use of the Event Space and its prime location, and bring in a rich diversity of events. The DEVB consulted the Harbourfront Commission on these refinements last year and received support from members. Relevant terms include:


While a two-envelope approach is maintained in this tender exercise, the weighting given to the technical proposal is increased from 40 per cent in previous exercises to 70 per cent, and only 30 per cent is accorded to the price proposal. The assessment on the technical proposals would take into account not only whether the events are diverse and capable of enhancing the vibrancy of the harbourfront, but also their appeal to visitors, so as to provide on-going support for the mega-event economy;
	
The fixed term of the new tenancy is extended from three years to five years, with a view to incentivising the tenant to make long-term investments and planning as well as to deliver events with due emphasis on both quality and quantity;
	
The tenant is required to provide, within one year from the commencement of the new tenancy and on a regular basis, food and beverage facilities with a floor area of not less than 100 square metres in the northern part of the Event Space adjacent to the promenade area. Apart from synergising with the events to be held at the Event Space, the facilities would also serve visitors to the harbourfront outside the period of any particular events; and
	
The requirement will continue for the tenant to run events for the public for at least about 30 per cent of days in its annual schedule. In addition, to avoid under-utilisation of the Event Space when no events or events relatively small in scale are taking place, in case no less than about one-third of the Event Space remains unused for events or is left unrented for a period of three consecutive days or above, the tenant is required to open that portion of the Event Space for public enjoyment and leisure activities free of charge.


Second, the DEVB has beefed up the terms and requirements in the tender documents to place a heavier onus on the tenant in monitoring future event organisers and to regularise the communication and alert mechanisms, so as to enable the DEVB, as the venue owner, to intervene in a timely manner. Similar clauses have also been introduced in the tender exercise for the harbourfront event space in Hung Hom launched earlier (December 22, 2025). Such clauses include:


The tenant is required to assess the credentials and experience of the applicants, their capability in hosting events, the feasibility of the proposed events, etc., before confirming approval of venue applications from event organisers. The tenant shall submit regular assessment reports to the DEVB;
	
The tenant shall closely monitor the progress of event preparation and alert the DEVB in a timely manner, such as whether the event is in alignment with the original proposal, whether the relevant licenses or permits have been applied for and obtained in a timely manner, and whether the ticketing arrangement is proper; and
	
The tenant and event organisers are required to hold a tripartite meeting with the DEVB prior to the events to confirm the progress of the final stage preparation and the arrangements made.
	

The spokesperson said that the tenant shall organise events and manage the Event Space in accordance with the commitments made in the technical proposal of the tender submission. A clause will be added in the new tenancy to the effect that if the actual number of event days held at the Event Space as rented out each year falls short of the commitment, the tenant is required to pay a compensation amount to the Government (equivalent to 10 per cent of the monthly rent of the Event Space for each day of shortfall). The arrangement aims to ensure the tenant would fully utilise the Event Space, maximising its efficiency.

Furthermore, with the concerted efforts of various parties involved, the Government has minimised the impact of the Airport Railway Extended Overrun Tunnel project being planned by the MTR Corporation Limited on the Event Space. The aboveground facilities of the railway project will be located outside the Event Space, and the temporary works areas required during the works period will only occupy the fringe of the site, with substantial reduction in the area and duration involved. The location of the required works area has been specified in the tender documents. With the above, when the railway project commences during the five-year fixed term of the Event Space, only minimal impact is envisaged on the use and operation of the Event Space.

Details of the tender exercise and the tender documents are available on the website of the Lands Department (www.landsd.gov.hk)."
​新年假期約95萬人次旅客訪港,2026-01-05 19:10,2026-01-05 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500667.htm,"由政務司司長陳國基領導的節慶安排跨部門工作小組今日（一月五日）表示，除夕及元旦假期昨日（一月四日）圓滿結束，由二○二五年十二月三十一日至二○二六年一月四日的整體訪港旅客數目約95萬人次，比去年同期上升約40%，接待訪港旅客的各個環節運作暢順。受惠於內地「調休」安排，香港錄得的內地入境旅客超過74萬人次，比去年同期上升約48%。非內地入境旅客則有約21萬人次，增長約19%。

陳國基說：「除夕及元旦假期期間，適逢內地元旦日起一連三日為公眾假期（即一月一日至三日），加上香港舉行多項活動包括跨年倒數，吸引不少旅客來港感受節日氣氛。一系列節慶活動充分展示香港的多元魅力，深受市民大眾和旅客歡迎，市面氣氛熱鬧。」

旅客流量、口岸情況和交通及公共運輸安排

因應跨年倒數活動，香港特別行政區政府與廣東省及深圳市相關部門實施兩項特別通關安排，包括羅湖口岸旅客清關服務延長至元旦日凌晨二時，以及深圳灣口岸的旅客及客車清關服務通宵運作，以便利市民及旅客往返香港及內地歡度佳節。除夕及元旦假期期間，一月一日為內地旅客入境高峰，約有22萬內地旅客人次訪港，其間最多內地旅客使用的入境口岸為高鐵西九龍管制站，其次為落馬洲支線管制站。

為疏導除夕及元旦假期期間的旅客流量，各口岸部門加派人手，加開檢查櫃枱及通道以疏導人流和車流。市民可透過一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」，獲取各陸路管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）、落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的平均輪候時間等資訊，計劃跨境行程。保安局並於假期期間啓動緊急事故監察及支援中心，密切監察和統籌全港各區包括各口岸的公眾秩序。其間，整體口岸運作及交通維持暢順，秩序良好。

運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心亦24小時運作，全面監察全港各區包括各口岸、主要車站及不同旅客熱點的交通和公共運輸服務情況。運輸署督導本地和跨境公共運輸服務營辦商加大運力，包括增加連接各陸路口岸的巴士班次，以及加強跨境巴士服務以滿足乘客需求。此外，營辦商增派人員維持秩序，並預留足夠車輛和人手，在有需要時進一步加強服務。除夕及元旦假期期間，整體交通大致暢順。

大型活動及主要旅遊景點情況

香港旅遊發展局於除夕晚上在中環遮打道行人專用區舉行的跨年倒數活動吸引了大批市民及旅客參與。香港多區亦有舉行倒數活動，為市民及旅客帶來了濃厚的節日氣氛。相關的特別交通及人流管制安排暢順。

除夕及元旦假期期間的訪港旅客足跡遍布本港各個主要旅遊景點，包括香港迪士尼樂園、海洋公園、昂坪360纜車、山頂纜車及西九文化區等。各個主要景點均人流暢旺，秩序良好。

除夕及元旦假期期間有不少旅客到訪郊野公園景點，包括西貢萬宜水庫東壩及大欖郊野公園大棠楓香林。經各部門協調，東壩及大棠楓香林一帶秩序良好，交通大致暢順。漁農自然護理署加強宣傳，提醒旅客正確使用行山徑，注意行山安全和禮儀；同時亦透過「郊野樂行」網頁公布東壩一帶的人流資訊及「體驗自然」網頁公布大棠楓香林紅葉指數，以便旅客更好規劃行程。

政府留意到假期期間其他熱門郊遊景點和露營營地的遊人大幅增加，漁農自然護理署和食物環境衞生署（食環署）已按情況加強承辦商清潔服務，並密切監察景點和營地的衞生情況。食環署會按需要在未來的假日期間加派人手處理清潔工作。

為照顧往來西貢萬宜水庫東壩的乘客需求，運輸署要求專線小巴營辦商作靈活車輛調配，因應乘客量增加9A號線（北潭涌—萬宜水庫東壩）的班次，並配合警方實施的交通管制措施，以疏導候車乘客，整體服務大致暢順。

訪港旅行團及酒店入住率

內地入境旅行團方面，除夕及元旦假期期間共有約630個內地入境旅行團超過23 000人次訪港，當中過夜行程佔約60%。旅行團的秩序整體良好。酒店入住率普遍達90%。

陳國基特別感謝各相關政府部門、機構和業界同心協力，妥善做好接待旅客的準備工作，讓旅客和市民歡度節日，共慶新年。"
About 950 000 visitors arrive in Hong Kong over New Year holidays,2026-01-05 19:10,2026-01-05 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500670.htm,"  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, today (January 5) announced that the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays concluded smoothly yesterday (January 4), with around 950 000 visitors arriving in Hong Kong between December 31, 2025, and January 4, 2026, representing an increase of about 40 per cent over the same period last year. All aspects of receiving visitors to Hong Kong operated smoothly. Benefitting from the Mainland's ""adjusted holiday"" arrangement, Mainland inbound visitors accounted for over 740 000, representing an increase of about 48 per cent year on year. The number of non-Mainland inbound visitors was around 210 000, representing an increase of about 19 per cent.

  Mr Chan said, ""The New Year's Eve and New Year holidays coincided with a three-day New Year public holiday on the Mainland (January 1 to 3). Coupled with an array of festive activities, including the Hong Kong New Year Countdown, these events attracted visitors to experience the festive ambience in the city. The series of festive events, fully showcasing Hong Kong's multifaceted charm, were popular among local citizens and visitors and created a lively atmosphere in the community.""

Visitor flow, situation at control points, and traffic and public transport arrangements

  In view of the countdown activities, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and relevant departments of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen Municipality implemented two special boundary-crossing arrangements, including extending the passenger clearance service at the Lo Wu Control Point to 2am of the New Year's Day, as well as extending the passenger and passenger vehicle clearance services at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point to operating overnight, in order to facilitate the passenger flow between Hong Kong and the Mainland for citizens and visitors to enjoy the festive season. During the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays, Mainland inbound visitor arrivals peaked on January 1, with around 220 000 visitors arriving in Hong Kong. During this period, the Express Rail Link West Kowloon Control Point received the highest number of Mainland visitors, followed by the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point.

  To cope with the increased passenger flow during the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays, relevant departments have deployed additional manpower and operated additional counters and channels to facilitate passenger and vehicular flows. The public may visit ""Easy Boundary"", a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance, to obtain information on the average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land boundary control points (BCPs), as well as for the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge shuttle bus (Gold Bus) and the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to plan their cross-boundary trips. The Security Bureau also activated the Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre during the holidays, to closely monitor and co-ordinate public order across various districts, including various BCPs. The overall operation of the control points and traffic were smooth and in order.

  The Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre of the Transport Department (TD) also operated round the clock to holistically monitor traffic conditions and public transport services across the territory, including BCPs, major stations and various tourist hotspots. The TD steered local and cross-boundary public transport operators (PTOs) to enhance their carrying capacity, including increasing the frequency of bus services connecting various land-based BCPs and strengthening cross-boundary coach services, to meet passenger demand. In addition, PTOs deployed additional staff to maintain order and reserved sufficient vehicles and manpower to further enhance services when necessary. During the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays, the overall traffic conditions were generally smooth.

Mega events and major tourist attractions

The Hong Kong Tourism Board's countdown event held on New Year's Eve at the Chater Road Pedestrian Precinct in Central attracted a lot of residents and visitors. A variety of countdown events also took place across Hong Kong, creating a vibrant festive atmosphere for both residents and visitors. Relevant special traffic arrangements and crowd control measures were implemented smoothly.

Visitors went to various major tourist attractions in Hong Kong during the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays, including Hong Kong Disneyland, Ocean Park, Ngong Ping 360, the Peak Tram, and the West Kowloon Cultural District. All major tourist spots were operating with high patronage and in good order.

During the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays, many visitors visited attractions within country parks, including the East Dam of High Island Reservoir at Sai Kung and Tai Tong Sweet Gum Woods at Tai Lam Country Park. Through concerted efforts of various departments, orders at the East Dam and Tai Tong were well maintained, and the traffic conditions were generally smooth. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) enhanced promotional efforts on reminding visitors to use hiking trails properly and promoted hiking safety and hiking etiquette, as well as published visitor flow information of the East Dam area on the ""Enjoy Hiking"" website and red leaf index of the Tai Tong Sweet Gum Woods on the ""Nature In Touch"" website, enabling visitors to better plan their trips.

  The Government has noted a significant increase in visitors to other popular countryside attractions and campsites during the holiday period. The AFCD and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) have arranged for contractors to enhance cleaning services according to the situation and closely monitored the hygiene conditions at the attractions and campsites. The FEHD will deploy additional staff during future holidays according to needs to handle cleaning duties.

  To cater for the needs of passengers travelling to Sai Kung High Island Reservoir East Dam, the TD requested the operator to arrange flexible deployment of vehicles to enhance the service of Green Minibus Route No. 9A (Pak Tam Chung - The East Dam, High Island Reservoir) with regard to passenger demand in co-ordination with the Police's traffic control measures to ease passenger waiting times. The overall services were generally smooth.

Inbound tour groups and hotel occupancy rates

In terms of Mainland inbound tour groups, around 630 Mainland inbound tour groups brought over 23 000 visitors to Hong Kong during the New Year's Eve and New Year holidays, with around 60 per cent engaged in overnight itineraries. The tour groups were generally in good order. The overall hotel occupancy rate reached 90 per cent in general.

   Mr Chan expressed gratitude to all relevant government departments, organisations, and industry partners for their collaborative efforts in preparing to welcome visitors, providing visitors and citizens with an enjoyable holiday experience and celebrating the New Year together."
​一名入境旅客進口未完稅香煙及另類吸煙產品罪成判囚（附圖）,2026-01-05 18:40,2026-01-05 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500607.htm,"一名入境旅客因進口未完稅香煙，未有向海關人員作出申報，以及進口另類吸煙產品，違反《應課稅品條例》和《進出口條例》，今日（一月五日）在西九龍裁判法院被判處監禁六個月和罰款二千元。

海關人員於二○二五年十月十日在香港國際機場截查一名二十二歲抵港女旅客，並在其個人行李內檢獲九萬一千六百支未完稅香煙及一支另類吸煙產品，市值約三十七萬六千元，應課稅值約三十萬三千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

該名女旅客今日就違反《應課稅品條例》，被判處監禁六個月和罰款一千元，以及就違反《進出口條例》被判處罰款一千元。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

根據《進出口條例》，任何人進口另類吸煙產品即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and alternative smoking product (with photo),2026-01-05 18:40,2026-01-05 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500603.htm,"An incoming passenger was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $2,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (January 5) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing an alternative smoking product, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming female passenger, aged 22, at Hong Kong International Airport on October 10, 2025. A total of 91 600 duty-not-paid cigarettes and an alternative smoking product, with an estimated market value of about $376,000 and a duty potential of about $303,000, were seized from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

The female passenger today was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 in contravention of the DCO, and was fined $1,000 in contravention of the IEO.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
中環海濱活動空間新租約公開招標,2026-01-05 18:14,2026-01-05 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500585.htm,"發展局今日（一月五日）表示，地政總署正就佔地約3.7公頃的中環海濱活動空間（活動空間）新租約公開招標（位置見附件），約六星期的招標期至二月十三日截止。新租約預計於四月前批出並由七月開始，為期五年。目前租約將於六月三十日完結。

發展局發言人說：「一直以來，政府透過由外間團體承租該活動空間的管理模式，成就多項大型盛事，打造品牌活動，例如香港美酒佳餚巡禮、Art Central、Clockenflap Music & Arts Festival等。是次招標會保留此管理模式，但會在兩方面作出優化，以進一步釋放活動空間的潛力，推動盛事經濟，以及加強場地管理，提升訪客體驗。」

第一，發展局優化了租約條款，推動租約承租人（即是次招標的中標者）善用這個位置優越的活動空間，安排更豐富的連串活動。局方去年就優化條款諮詢了海濱事務委員會並獲委員支持，相關條款包括：

（1）是次招標繼續採用「雙信封制」，但將技術建議的評分比重由從前的百分之四十增至百分之七十，而價格建議只佔百分之三十。技術建議除考慮活動是否多元、能否提升海濱活力外，亦會考慮活動對訪客的吸引力，以繼續支持盛事經濟；

（2）新租約固定年期由三年延至五年，鼓勵承租人作長遠投資和規劃，提供質量兼備的活動；

（3）承租人需在新租約開始後一年內開始在用地以北接壤海濱長廊地帶，提供不少於100平方米樓面的恆常餐飲設施，除與場內活動互相協同外，在未有活動時亦可為海濱訪客提供方便；及

（4）每年須繼續有最少約三成日數舉辦開放予公眾參與的活動。另外，為免場地在沒有活動期間或活動相對小型的時候未被善用，如活動空間內有不少於約三分之一的範圍連續三日或以上未有舉辦活動或租出，承租人需開放該部分場地供公眾免費享用，讓公眾進行各式各樣的休閒活動。

第二，是次招標加入條款，強化租約承租人對日後活動舉辦方的監察角色，並常規化溝通預警機制，讓發展局作為場地業主適時介入。發展局早前（上月二十二日）就紅磡海濱活動空間的招標亦有引入相同條款，包括：

（1）明確要求承租人接納活動舉辦方的場地租用申請前，須先行評估申請者的背景、舉辦活動的能力、活動可行性等，並按時向發展局提交評估報告；

（2）承租人需密切監察活動籌備過程，例如活動安排是否符合原先建議、能否如期申領牌照／許可，以至門票出售安排等，並適時通報發展局；及

（3）規定承租人及活動舉辦方須在開展活動前和發展局舉行三方會議，以便確立最後階段的情況和部署。

​發言人指出，承租人須按標書中承諾的技術建議落實活動和管理場地。新租約會引入條款，規定承租人如每年出租該場地舉辦活動的日數未能達到其承諾的日數，須向政府支付補償金額（即每少一日繳交相等於月租百分之十的款項）。此安排旨在確保承租人善用活動空間，以發揮其最大效益。

另外，經過多方努力，政府已將香港鐵路有限公司計劃中的機場鐵路掉頭隧道延展段工程對活動空間的影響減至最低。該工程項目的地面設施將設於活動空間範圍以外，而施工期間的臨時工地將位處邊緣，所需面積和時間亦大幅減少，有關位置已在招標文件中指明，當工程在活動空間的五年租期內啓動，預計工程對活動空間的使用及管理影響有限。

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-05 17:30,2026-01-05 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500553.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月五日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-05 17:30,2026-01-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500554.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 5), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
HAD opens temporary cold shelters,2026-01-05 17:30,2026-01-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500523.htm,"  ​In view of the cold weather, the Home Affairs Department has opened 18 temporary cold shelters in various districts today (January 5) for people in need of the service.

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2026-01-05 16:30,2026-01-05 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500469.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月五日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在去年十二月二十八日至今年一月三日期間，中心錄得兩宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，兩名病人均有長期病患，詳情如下：


76歲女病人，居於東區；及
66歲男病人，居於西貢區。


​中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這兩宗社區感染個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

本港於二○二五年錄得167宗退伍軍人病個案，而今年（截至一月三日）未有錄得退伍軍人病個案。二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池、加濕器和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米或以下，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2026-01-05 16:30,2026-01-05 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500471.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (January 5) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From December 28 last year to January 3 this year, the CHP recorded two community-acquired LD cases. Both patients had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:


A 76-year-old female patient living in Eastern District; and
A 66-year-old male patient living in Sai Kung District.


​The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between the twocommunity-acquired cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

  One hundred sixty-seven LD cases had been recorded in 2025, while no LD cases had been recorded so far this year (as of January 3). In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpool spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or ships.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, water fountains, humidifiers and home respiratory devices that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


​The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) or less and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-05 16:23,2026-01-05 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500515.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 5) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-05 16:23,2026-01-05 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500518.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月五日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

商經局局長出席香港青年工商界專題午餐會致辭全文（只有中文）,2026-01-05 15:37,2026-01-05 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500475.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局（商經局）局長丘應樺今日（一月五日）出席香港青年工商界專題午餐會的致辭：

楊副會長（香港中華總商會副會長楊燕芝）、黃主席（香港中華總商會青年委員會主席黃進達）、各位青年工商界的領袖、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。我非常高興今日出席香港青年工商界專題午餐會，與各位具活力、有抱負、敢創新的青年企業家和工商界新一代領袖聚首一堂。這次午餐會的氣氛非常熱烈，看到大家都非常活躍、非常高興。每次與青年工商界交流，我都感受到香港經濟的生命力和未來動能，我感到自己也變得更年輕。

首先，我衷心感謝16個合辦機構的悉心籌備，讓大家交流香港經濟的新方向、新機遇，以及青年在未來產業布局中的重要位置。

近年全球政經格局急促轉變，地緣風險上升、供應鏈重新分布、國際貿易規則不斷演變，令香港面對不少挑戰。然而，這些挑戰同時亦為香港帶來新的定位和機遇。國家「十五五」規劃正全面開展，當中明確提出要鞏固並提升香港國際金融、航運及貿易中心地位。特區政府將繼續發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，堅定履行香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的核心角色，以更積極、更主動、更全面的方式對接國家「十五五」規劃，推動香港更深入地融入和服務國家發展大局。

對在座各位青年工商界朋友而言，這些政策方向不只是宏觀藍圖，更是與各個企業在市場拓展、人才策略、科技應用，以至國際定位等息息相關。

在融入國家發展方面，香港的角色比以往任何時候都更重要。商經局於上年正式啓動內地企業出海專班，旨在將香港全面融入國家「走出去」的戰略。出海專班首次把香港的外地辦事處，包括投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局（貿發局），以及香港駐內地辦事處的網絡整合起來，建立前所未有的一站式平台，協助內地企業在目前複雜多變的國際環境下，利用香港作為安全可靠、具有國際信譽的橋樑，穩妥推展海外業務。這個平台不僅能夠提升香港服務內地企業的能力，也為香港的專業服務、法律、會計、科技研發、金融服務等行業帶來龐大的合作機遇。

同時，政府會繼續在國際舞台上積極拓展香港經貿網絡，鞏固香港作為國際貿易中心的地位。香港駐吉隆坡經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦）已於上月投入運作，標誌着香港在東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）的布局再進一步。東盟市場是全球增長最快的地區之一，消費能力持續提升、企業對科技及專業服務需求殷切，對香港企業尤其是青年創業者而言，是非常值得深耕的市場。

政府亦會擴大現有東盟經貿辦的覆蓋範圍，加強與周邊亞洲國家的經貿推廣，同時研究把網絡伸延至更多具發展潛力的市場，包括中亞、中東及其他「一帶一路」沿線國家。這些地區的基建發展、專業服務需求、品牌及科技合作空間極大，相信香港能在這些新市場中發揮更大作用。

香港的經濟生態離不開中小企業，香港的企業中有98%是中小企，而青年創業者更是其中最具活力的一群。面對外圍環境持續波動，中小企在融資、成本、市場拓展方面仍存在壓力，因此《施政報告》延續並強化多項措施支援企業穩步發展，包括把中小企融資擔保計劃下八成擔保產品的申請期限延長兩年，並再次延長「還息不還本」安排一年，協助企業保持運作和增加彈性。政府亦向「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）注資14.3億元，並把資助地域範圍擴展至新增的八個市場，其中包括多個「一帶一路」沿線國家。另外，透過「BUD專項基金」——「申請易」，我們希望讓更多企業特別是青年創業者更便捷地參與海外展覽及推廣活動，加強品牌曝光，進入多元化市場。

跨境電商的興起為香港企業帶來前所未有的機會，亦是特別適合青年企業家發揮的舞台。政府未來三年會繼續在內地及東盟市場舉辦「香港好物節」，協助本地品牌展示產品與服務。政府亦會推行「創意・電商無限」計劃，旨在透過博覽會、一站式商業配對及轉介服務等專業支援，強化港商數碼營銷能力，協助青年企業更有效掌握跨境電商的趨勢。

為提升整體經貿支援的協同效應，政府將推出「經貿一站通」，把經貿辦、投資推廣署及貿發局的海外辦事處整合成功能平台，更有系統地協助中小企及初創企業「走出去」。此平台將組織更多海外商務考察團，讓青年企業家能實地了解不同市場的發展脈搏，及早把握機遇。

知識產權作為創意的無形資產，已成為推動高質量知識型經濟增長的核心動力。今年《施政報告》提出完善知識產權貿易生態，包括剛推出的知識產權融資沙盒試點計劃、提供專利評估服務和推行專利估值先導計劃等。透過這些措施，政府致力推動知識產權的融資、估值與保障機制，從而更有效發揮企業的創新價值，助力企業擴展業務和提升競爭力。

各位青年工商界朋友，「十五五」規劃聚焦高質量發展、科技創新以及更高水平的對外開放，而香港正好憑藉其國際金融、航運及貿易中心的優勢，成為國家連接全球的重要平台。香港要抓緊「十五五」規劃帶來的機遇，青年力量不可或缺。年輕一代不僅具備敏銳的科技觸覺、開放的國際視野和靈活的思維方式，更勇於嘗試新模式、新市場和新科技，是推動香港產業升級、企業數碼化與國際化的關鍵動力。當前全球經濟雖面臨諸多挑戰，但機遇同樣遍布各處，這與「十五五」規劃強調的創新驅動高度契合。只要善用香港內聯外通的獨特制度優勢，積極融入國家發展大局，香港企業定能在國際舞台上開拓更廣闊的發展空間。

在此再次感謝各合辦機構的努力，以及在座各位對香港經濟發展的支持。特區政府願與青年工商界攜手前行，把握國家發展提供的巨大機遇，推動香港再創高峰。

祝各位身體健康、事業成功，並預祝今日的午餐會圓滿成功。多謝大家。"

The monthly mean maximum temperature of 22.4 degrees, monthly mean temperature of 20.2 degrees and monthly mean minimum temperature of 18.4 degrees were 2.0 degrees, 2.0 degrees and 2.2 degrees above their corresponding normals, and all of them were the second highest on record for December. This was also the first time that no Cold Weather Warning was in force in November and December in a year since the Cold Weather Warning System commenced operation in 1999. The month was also drier than usual with a total rainfall of 6.5 millimetres, only about 23 per cent of the normal of 28.8 millimetres. The annual total rainfall of 2 558.7 millimetres was about 5 per cent above the annual normal of 2 431.2 millimetres.

 With a band of clouds covering the coast of Guangdong, the weather of Hong Kong was mainly cloudy with one or two rain patches on the first four days of the month. Under the influence of a dry northeast monsoon, the weather turned generally fine and dry on December 5 and remained so on the following four days. With the return of a cloud band, it turned mainly cloudy with one or two rain patches on December 10 and the next morning. It turned generally fine during the day on December 11 as the clouds thinned out. With plenty of sunshine, the maximum temperature at the Observatory rose to 26.0 degrees that afternoon, the highest of the month. A fresh to strong easterly airstream affected the coast of Guangdong the next day. Locally, the weather remained mainly fine and dry.

 A cold front moved across the coast of Guangdong on the late afternoon of December 13. Under the influence of its associated strong northeast monsoon, winds strengthened from the north and temperatures fell progressively. It was rather cool on the mornings of the next two days. Additionally, while one or two rain patches occurred on December 13 under the influence of a broad band of clouds, the weather turned generally fine on the night of December 14 under the influence of a dry northeast monsoon and remained so on the next three days. It was also very dry on December 14 and 15, with the relative humidity over most parts of the territory staying around 30 to 40 per cent during the day. With the return of a broad band of clouds, the weather became cloudier with one or two rain patches later on December 18 and the next day. As the cloud band thinned out, the weather turned generally fine and dry during the day on December 20.

 Under the influence of a fresh to strong northeast monsoon, it was windier on the following two days. While it was fine and dry on December 21, the weather turned mainly cloudy on December 22 due to the approach of a cloud band and remained so on the following four days. While there were one or two rain patches on the morning of December 25, with a replenishment of the northeast monsoon reaching the coast of Guangdong that morning, the local weather became dry and cool that day. It remained dry with rather cool mornings on the following two days, with the temperature at the Observatory falling to a minimum of 13.8 degrees on the morning of December 27, the lowest of the month. Under the influence of the dry northeast monsoon, the local weather turned mainly fine from December 27 to 29. With the moderation of the northeast monsoon, winds subsided on December 30, with visibility falling below 5 000 metres over parts of the territory that morning. An easterly airstream brought cloudier weather on the last day of the month.

 Three tropical cyclones occurred over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific in December 2025.

DH's Medical Device Administrative Control System receives ISO 9001:2015 certification (with photos),2026-01-05 14:38,2026-01-05 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500427.htm,"  ​The Medical Device Administrative Control System (MDACS) of the Department of Health (DH) has been awarded the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems (QMS) Certificate, developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The award ceremony was held today (January 5). The achievement of the MDACS in obtaining this international standard marks an important milestone in laying the foundation for the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) by the DH at the end of this year. This accomplishment will facilitate international recognition and foster an innovation-friendly environment.

The ceremony took place at the DH's headquarters. The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, said, ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is committed to raising regulatory standards for medical products in Hong Kong. With the establishment of the CMPR, we will consolidate regulatory functions for Western and Chinese medicines, as well as medical devices, thereby enhancing the existing regulatory regime in a holistic manner. The DH is proceeding at full speed with preparatory work, guided by three key strategies: promoting regulatory excellence, fostering innovation in pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and deepening co-operation with the Chinese Mainland and overseas countries. The ISO accreditation, which covers all aspects of the MDACS (including pre- and post-market control), will strengthen confidence among industry professionals both in Hong Kong and internationally, as well as among the general public. It will encourage more medical device manufacturers and importers to voluntarily list their medical devices with the MDACS. In the long run, it will also help facilitate a smooth transition for listed products to the statutory regulatory framework.""

  To safeguard public health, the DH has drawn on recommendations from the Global Harmonization Task Force (now known as the International Medical Device Regulators Forum) and introduced the voluntary MDACS in 2004. The system involves approving the list of medical devices to ensure their safety, quality, and performance, establishing a trader listing system, and implementing a post-market monitoring system for products.

""Currently, over 8 900 medical devices are listed under the MDACS. In response to the latest international trends in medical device regulation and to align with the establishment timeline of the CMPR, the Government is pressing ahead with legislative preparations and comprehensively reviewing the proposed regulatory framework. Legislative proposals are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council this year. Under the new framework, all medical devices supplied in Hong Kong will require registration unless exempted, ensuring compliance with relevant safety, quality, and performance standards,"" Dr Lam said.

ISO 9001 is an internationally recognised QMS standard developed by the ISO. It assists organisations in establishing consistent procedures to ensure their products and services consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and promoting sustainable business development. This standard is one of the most widely adopted quality improvement frameworks worldwide, improving operational efficiency and quality through risk-based thinking and continuous improvement.

The Medical Device Division of the DH initiated the establishment of its QMS in 2025 and obtained ISO 9001:2015 QMS certification in December of the same year. Additionally, the DH's Drug Office obtained ISO 9001 QMS certifications in 2005 for drug traders licensing procedures and inspection of undesirable medical advertisements, and in 2009 for its manufacturer licensing and quality management standard inspections. The relevant QMS will continue to be implemented after the establishment of the CMPR."

衞生署醫療器械行政管理制度獲ISO 9001：2015認證（附圖）,2026-01-05 12:40,2026-01-05 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500257.htm,"​衞生署醫療器械行政管理制度（管理制度）獲頒發國際標準化組織制定的ISO 9001：2015質量管理體系證書，頒授儀式今日（一月五日）舉行。管理制度達致國際標準，為衞生署今年年底成立的「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」（「香港藥械監管中心」）奠下其中一個重要基石，有助爭取國際認可，營造有利創新的環境。

頒授儀式在衞生署總部舉行，衞生署署長林文健醫生說：「香港特別行政區政府致力提升香港藥械的監管水平。『香港藥械監管中心』成立後，將整合西藥、中藥及醫療器械的監管職能，全面提升現行制度。衞生署正全速進行籌建工作，以三大策略為導向，包括推動優質監管、促進藥械創新，以及深化與中國內地和國際合作。今次榮獲ISO（國際標準化組織）認證，涵蓋管理制度的全部工作，包括醫療器械上市前和上市後監管，有助增強海內外業界和廣大市民的信心，鼓勵更多醫療器械製造商和進口商根據這個制度自願向衞生署表列其醫療器械，亦有助相關各方日後順利過渡至長遠的法定規管模式。」

為保障公眾健康，衞生署自二○○四年起參考全球協調醫療器械規管專責小組（現為國際醫療器械監管機構論壇）的建議，設立自願性的管理制度，透過審批表列醫療器械，確保其安全、品質和性能，並推行貿易商的制度和產品推出市場後的監察系統。

林文健醫生說：「目前已有超過8 900項醫療器械在表列制度下表列。因應近年國際間規管醫療器械的最新趨勢，同時為配合『香港藥械監管中心』的成立時間表，政府現正全力推進相關立法準備工作，全面檢討擬議規管架構，預計今年向立法會提交立法建議。在新的立法框架下，日後所有在港供應的醫療器械，如非獲豁免均須註冊，以確保符合安全、品質和性能的相關標準。」

ISO 9001是一套國際認可的品質管理系統標準，由國際標準化組織制定，旨在幫助組織建立一套一致的流程，以確保組織的產品和服務能持續滿足客戶及法規要求，最終提升客戶滿意度並促進企業永續發展。此標準是全球最具認受性的品質改善框架之一，透過風險導向思維和持續改善，提高營運效率和品質。

衞生署醫療器械科二○二五年啓動建立質量管理體系程序，同年十二月獲ISO 9001：2015質量管理體系認證。此外，衞生署藥物辦公室亦分別已於二○○五年就藥商的發牌程序及不良廣告（醫藥）的查閱，以及於二○○九年就生產商發牌及質量管理規範巡查獲ISO 9001質量管理體系認證。相關品質管理系統在「香港藥械監管中心」成立後繼續推行。"
