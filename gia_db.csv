立法會二十題：清理街道上的雜草,2026-02-04 12:20,2026-02-04 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400300.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上周浩鼎議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有市民反映，行人路邊及路磚之間不時有野草長出，影響衞生及市容，而據悉目前各政府部門均會委聘外判承辦商定期清理其管轄道路範圍內的雜草。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時由政府委聘以處理全港道路及街道旁雜草的外判承辦商數目及名單為何；相關政府部門有何機制監察該等外判承辦商的工作表現及績效；

（二）過去五年，第（一）項所述的外判承辦商中，因表現不達標而被施加處分的外判承辦商數目為何，並按其所負責的地區（以全港18區劃分）以表列出分項資料；

（三）過去五年，當局有否向個別外判承辦商增撥額外資源以協助其加強清理雜草；如有，有關項目的成效為何，並按外判承辦商所負責的地區（以全港18區劃分）以表列出分項資料；及

（四）有否考慮使用創新科技（例如無人機）定期巡視街道上的雜草黑點，以協助當局能更快速地發現有關問題並加強清理工作；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

公共行人路旁的植物按其種類（即樹木或其他植物）及所在土地的類別，按照發展局工務技術通告編號6/2015的分工由不同政府部門或私人土地業權人負責護養（包括進行適當修剪及清除雜草）。有關部門或土地業權人會適時安排修剪其轄下植物及清除雜草，避免植物過度生長，伸出行人路影響行人。

就周議員提問的各部分，經諮詢路政署、地政總署及康樂及文化事務署（康文署）後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）現時路政署透過委聘承建商為全港各區的公共道路進行道路維修保養工作，當中包括為位於一般道路旁伸出行人路並對行人構成即時危險的植物進行緊急修剪，以及清理行人路路磚雜草（承建商名單見附件一）。

路政署在合約內訂明，承建商須為合約涵蓋的所有行人路，每月進行至少一次巡查及完成所需的維修保養工作，包括按需要清理路面雜草，並提交完成跟進工作前後的現場照片作紀錄。雖然路政署並沒有就對行人構成即時危險的植物進行緊急修剪設立服務承諾，路政署在收到任何有關對行人或道路構成即時危險的查詢或投訴後，均會迅速安排跟進，並在七個工作天內給予回覆。路政署會按相關合約機制，就承建商未能按時妥善完成有關工作並提交報告，向其發出違約通知書及扣減合約款項。

路政署過去五年曾在發現承建商的行人路維修保養工作欠妥時，根據相關合約條款作出適當的跟進（例如向表現不理想的承建商發出違約通知書）。然而，由於相關跟進工作涉及各種維修工作欠妥的情況，路政署並無特別就清理行人路雜草工作質量問題的跟進工作分拆備存有關統計數據。

另一方面，地政總署負責未獲任何政府部門負責日常管理及保養的未批租及未撥用政府土地上的樹木及植物（通稱「樹草」）的管理，包括清理雜草。由於全港未批租及未撥用政府土地上的樹木及植物繁多，分布甚廣，地政總署只會在有需要情況（如收到投訴或轉介）下，按公眾安全和衞生考慮，以及按「風險為本」的原則（例如會否即時影響人命或財物安全，或引起蚊患），進行所需的清理工作。清理雜草的工作屬於地政總署整體樹草管理工作的一部分，相關的植物護養外判承辦商名單見附件二。

地政總署的承辦商會在接獲涉及雜草叢生的投訴／轉介日起計的指定日數內，先後向投訴人發出確認通知、實地視察及提交報告。署方會根據實際情況和工作優次（一般會優先移除和修剪較大風險的樹木），安排清理工作，並盡力在接獲個案後的兩個月內完成雜草清理。過去兩年，所有涉及清理雜草的5 256宗個案均能在兩個月內完成，亦沒有承辦商因效績不達標而受到懲處。

除此以外，康文署亦有兩類包括清除雜草的合約，即園藝保養服務合約及修剪雜草服務合約，其服務承辦商名單見附件三。

康文署會因應園藝保養工作的需要和性質，訂立不同合約的要求，包括要求承辦商提交附有相片的工作報告，以證明承辦商已完成工作並符合合約要求。另外，康文署負責監督的管理人員會進行定期實地巡查、突擊檢查，及與承辦商進行會議，監督承辦商及其員工的工作表現。若發現承辦商未能履行合約要求，康文署會按情況根據合約條款向承辦商發出勸諭信、失責通知書，甚至會終止合約等。

在過去五年，康文署並未因修剪雜草服務合約外判承辦商表現不達標而向其施加處分。至於園藝保養合約方面，因表現不達標而被施加處分的外判承辦商數目如下（註）：

註：有關處分以合約為單位，故未能提供分區細項。

（三）如上文所述，清理雜草工作屬有關部門的恆常工作，因此沒有涉及因清理雜草工作而撥用的額外財政資源。

（四）政府各部門對使用創新科技（例如無人機）協助監察工作持開放態度，並將考慮所涉及資源及實際成效等，以適當應用於巡視街道上的雜草黑點。

其中，路政署一直致力透過創新科技優化公共道路的維修保養。為提升巡查效率及精確度，路政署研發了結合地理空間人工智能（GeoAI）與高解像度攝影機及攝影測量技術的偵測道路欠妥系統（RDDS）。目前配備RDDS的巡路檢測車可以自動識別路面裂縫及褪色路面標記，而路政署正全力推進系統的優化與升級，將為新一代系統引入更先進的人工智能演算法「視覺轉換器」，大幅提升圖像識別的精確度與處理速度，並將偵測功能擴展至涵蓋路面雜草過度生長等情況。若路政署發現個別地點經常有路旁植物過度生長，亦會通知相關部門加強修剪植物及清理雜草或與土地業權人作適當跟進，以免出現影響行人安全的情況。"
​立法會七題：居者有其屋計劃,2026-02-04 12:20,2026-02-04 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400335.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上林筱魯議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）負責制訂和推行居者有其屋計劃（居屋）的政策，而其最終目標是鼓勵業主根據《建築物管理條例》（第344章）成立業主立案法團（法團），讓業主接管屋苑的管理責任。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於在居屋落成後和其法團組成前，房委會會擔任該等居屋的公契經理人（經理人），以為屋苑委聘合資格的物業管理服務公司，執行日常管理工作，現時仍由房委會擔任經理人的居屋數目為何，並按居屋名稱及單位數目列出分項數字；及

（二）有否了解第（一）項所述的居屋仍未成立法團的原因為何，令房委會仍需繼續擔任其經理人；如有，具體詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）一直致力完善置業階梯，並透過提供不同種類的資助出售單位，協助不同負擔能力的家庭置業，當中包括居者有其屋計劃（居屋）。為了可以即時及有序地進行物業管理，批地文件和大廈公契規定，房委會在居屋屋苑的大廈公契生效後擔任居屋屋苑的首任公契經理人，為屋苑委聘合資格的物業管理服務公司，執行日常管理工作，包括公用地方及設施的保安、清潔和維修工作，並協助業主監察物業管理服務公司的表現。同時，根據大廈公契，公契經理人須在公契生效起計九個月內召開業主會議，以成立業主立案法團（法團）或業主委員會。根據《建築物管理條例》（第344章）（《條例》）第3（2）條，委出管理委員會（管委會）的決議，須獲過半數票（包括業主親自或委任代表投的票（註））通過，以及獲總共擁有不少於百分之三十業權份數的業主支持。

就林筱魯議員的提問，我們現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年十二月三十一日，房委會過往興建的所有187個居屋屋苑當中，已有155個居屋屋苑由相關的業主透過法團或業主委員會接管屋苑的管理工作，佔全港居屋屋苑近八成半。現時，仍然由房委會擔任公契經理人的居屋屋苑共有32個，約一半都是近五年內入伙的屋苑，當中三個屋苑已成立法團或業主委員會，接管屋苑的管理工作正在進行中。其餘的29個屋苑則須獲業主於業主大會上通過決議，才能成立法團。有關屋苑的名稱及其單位數目列於附件。

（二）《條例》為法團的成立和運作提供法律框架，以便業主成立法團，更妥善管理屋苑。就管理而言，居屋與一般私人住宅樓宇無異。房委會一直以來積極協助居屋屋苑業主籌組法團，地區民政事務處亦會按需要提供協助。在法團成立之前，房委會作為公契經理人，會督導和要求物業管理公司主動與業主作日常交流以鼓勵有興趣的業主籌組法團；房委會亦會聯絡當區的民政事務處舉辦講座，介紹有關籌組法團和大廈管理的資訊，及協助有意參加管委會的業主舉行業主大會等。至於最終能否成功成立法團接管屋苑管理，則取決於個別屋苑業主的意願。

對於未能於業主大會中通過成立法團的屋苑，房委會會繼續積極了解業主的關注，並繼續透過不同渠道向業主推廣良好有效的大廈管理方法，包括與民政事務處合作舉辦講座及派發宣傳品，讓業主體會妥善管理大廈的好處，以鼓勵他們成立法團。房委會會適時檢討推行措施的成效及繼續安排成立法團的會議，以達致推動業主成立法團及接管屋苑管理的目標。

註：除公契另有規定外，業主每擁有一份業權份數，即有一票。"
LCQ7: Home Ownership Scheme,2026-02-04 12:20,2026-02-04 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400338.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Andrew Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) is responsible for formulating and implementing the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) policy. The ultimate goal of this policy is to encourage owners to form owners' corporations (OCs) in accordance with the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344), thereby enabling them to take over the management responsibilities of their HOS courts. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that, upon the completion of HOS courts and prior to the formation of their OCs, the HKHA serves as the manager under the Deed of Mutual Covenant (the manager) for those HOS courts and appoints qualified Property Services Agents to carry out the day-to-day management of the HOS courts, of the current number of HOS courts for which the HKHA still serves as the manager, with a breakdown by court name and number of units involved; and

(2) whether it has ascertained the reasons why the HOS courts mentioned in (1) have not yet formed OCs, thereby necessitating the HKHA's continued role as their manager; if so, of the specific details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) has all along been striving to enrich the housing ladder and assist households with different affordability to achieve home ownership through the provision of various types of Subsidised Sale Flats, including those under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS). To ensure prompt and orderly property management, the Land Grant and the Deeds of Mutual Covenant (DMC) stipulate that the HKHA will act as the initial DMC manager of the HOS courts after the date of the DMC. The HKHA shall appoint qualified Property Services Agents (PSAs) to undertake daily management matters, including security, cleaning and maintenance of common areas and facilities, whilst assisting owners in monitoring the performance of PSAs. In parallel, according to the DMC, the DMC Manager shall call a meeting of owners within nine months after the date of the DMC with a view to forming an Owners' Corporation (OC) or an Owners' Committee. Pursuant to section 3(2) of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) (the Ordinance), a resolution on the appointment of the management committee (MC) must be passed by a majority of votes of the owners (including votes cast by owners in person or by proxy (note)) and supported by the owners of not less than 30 per cent of the shares in aggregate.

  In response to the question raised by the Hon Andrew Lam, our reply is as follows:

(1) As at December 31, 2025, among all of the 187 HOS courts constructed by the HKHA, 155 of them have already been taken over by their respective owners through OCs or Owners' Committees for estate management, accounting for almost 85 per cent of all HOS courts in Hong Kong. Currently, the HKHA remains the DMC manager of 32 HOS courts, around half of which had intake within the recent past five years. Among these courts, three of them have established OCs or Owners' Committees with the handover of management responsibilities underway. As for the remaining 29 courts, the relevant resolution must be passed by owners at meetings of owners in order to establish an OC. The names of the relevant HOS courts and their respective numbers of units are listed in Annex.

(2) The Ordinance provides a legal framework for the establishment and operation of OCs, enabling owners to form OCs for better management of their housing estates. In terms of management, HOS courts are no different from general private residential properties. The HKHA has been proactively providing assistance to owners of HOS courts in forming OCs, and District Offices will also provide assistance as necessary. Prior to the establishment of an OC, the HKHA as the DMC Manager, will supervise and require the PSAs to proactively engage with owners through daily exchanges to encourage interested owners to organise an OC. The HKHA also liaises with the relevant District Offices to organise seminars sharing information on forming OCs as well as building management. Moreover, the HKHA also assists owners who would like to participate in the MC to hold meetings of owners. Whether an OC can be successfully formed ultimately to take over the estate management depends on the willingness of the owners of individual courts.

  As regards the courts where the establishment of an OC could not be passed at meetings of owners, the HKHA will continue to actively gauge the owners' concerns. We will also continue to promote good and effective building management practices through various channels, including organising seminars and distributing promotional materials in collaboration with District Offices, with a view to enlightening owners of the benefits of good building management and encouraging them to establish OCs. The HKHA will review the effectiveness of the implementation measures in due course and continue to arrange meetings for the formation of OCs, with the aim to promoting the establishment of OCs and enabling owners to take over the management of their estates.

Note: Unless otherwise stipulated in the DMC, each owner shall have one vote for each share of ownership they hold."
LCQ20: Clearing weeds on streets,2026-02-04 12:20,2026-02-04 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400306.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Holden Chow and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

Some members of the public have relayed that weeds often grow along pavement edges and between paving blocks, affecting hygiene and the cityscape, and it is learnt that various government departments currently engage outsourced contractors to regularly clear weeds on the roads within their purview. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current number and list of outsourced contractors engaged by the Government to handle weeds along roads and streets across the territory; the mechanism put in place by the relevant government departments to monitor the work performance and effectiveness of these outsourced contractors;

(2) of the number of outsourced contractors mentioned in (1) that were penalised for failing to meet performance standards in the past five years, with a tabulated breakdown by district for which they are responsible (broken down by the 18 districts across the territory);

(3) whether the authorities have allocated additional resources to individual outsourced contractors in the past five years to assist them in enhancing weed clearance; if so, of the effectiveness of the relevant projects, with a tabulated breakdown by district for which outsourced contractors are responsible (broken down by the 18 districts across the territory); and

(4) whether it has considered using innovative technologies (such as drones) to conduct regular inspections of weed blackspots on streets, so as to assist the authorities in identifying the relevant problems more expeditiously and enhancing clearance efforts; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Vegetation alongside public footpaths is maintained (including carrying out appropriate pruning and weed clearance) by different government departments or private lot owners in accordance with the division of labour in the Development Bureau Technical Circular (Works) No. 6/2015 depending on the type of vegetation concerned (i.e. trees or other vegetation) and the category of land on which the vegetation is located. The relevant departments or lot owners shall arrange timely pruning of vegetation under their purview and weed clearance in order to prevent excessive growth of vegetation encroaching upon footpaths, thus adversely affecting pedestrians.

In consultation with the Highways Department (HyD), Lands Department (LandsD) and Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), my reply to the various parts of the question raised by the HonHolden Chow is as follows:

(1)and (2) The HyD currently engages contractors to carry out repair and maintenance work for the public roads across all districts of Hong Kong, including carrying out urgent trimming of vegetation extending from general roadside areas into footpaths where it poses imminent danger to pedestrians, as well as clearing weeds at footpath paving blocks (a list of contractors is at Annex I).

The HyD has stipulated in each contract that the contractor is obliged to conduct at least one monthly inspection of all footpaths covered by the contract and complete necessary repair and maintenance work, including clearing weeds from the pavement as required, and submit site photos taken before and after the follow-up work for record. Although the HyD has not set any performance pledge for urgent trimming of vegetation posing imminent danger to pedestrians, the department will promptly arrange follow-up action upon receipt of any enquiry or complaint about matters posing imminent danger to pedestrians or roads, and provide a reply within seven working days. If contractor fails to complete the relevant work properly and submit the relevant report on time, the HyD will issue a Default Notice to the contractor and deduct the corresponding contract payment in accordance with the relevant contractual mechanism.

Over the past five years, the HyD has taken appropriate follow-up actions in accordance with relevant contract provisions upon identification of deficiencies in contractors' maintenance work on footpaths (e.g. issuing Default Notices to contractors with unsatisfactory performance). However, as such follow-up actions were related to various types of maintenance deficiencies, the HyD has not separately maintained statistics specifically concerning the follow-up actions related to the quality of weed clearance work at footpaths.

On the other hand, the LandsD is responsible for the management of trees and plants (collectively referred to as ""vegetation""), including weed clearance, on unleased and unallocated government land (UUGL) not under the routine management and maintenance of any government departments. Given the large number and wide distribution of trees and vegetation on UUGL across Hong Kong, the LandsD will only carry out maintenance work as necessary (such as upon receipt of complaints or referrals) having regard to public safety and public hygiene on a ""risk-based"" approach (for example, whether there is an immediate threat to life or property or a risk of mosquito infestation). Weed clearance is part of the LandsD's overall vegetation management work and a list of contractors engaged for vegetation maintenance is at Annex II.

The LandsD's contractors shall, within specified days upon receiving a complaint/referral concerning overgrown grass, issue an acknowledgement to the complainant, then conduct a site inspection and submit a report. The department will arrange clearance operations based on the actual circumstances and operational priorities (generally prioritising removal and trimming of trees that pose higher risks). The department also strives to complete weed clearance within two months upon receipt of a case. In the past two years, all 5 256 cases involving weed clearance were completed within two months, and no contractors were penalised for failing to meet the performance standards.

In addition, the LCSD has two types of contracts that cover weed clearance, namely the Horticultural Maintenance Services Contract and the Undergrowth Cutting Services Contract. The list of service contractors for these contracts is at Annex III.

The LCSD has established different contractual requirements based on the needs and nature of horticultural maintenance work, such as requiring contractors to submit work reports with photos to prove that the contractors have completed the work and met the contract requirements. In addition, supervisory personnel of the LCSD will conduct regular on-site inspections, surprise checks, and meetings with contractors to monitor the performance of the contractors and their employees. If a contractor fails to meet the contract requirements, the LCSD will issue Advisory Letters, Default Notices, or even terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms, depending on the circumstances.

Over the past five years, the LCSD has not imposed any disciplinary measures on contractors for the weed-cutting service contract due to substandard performance. As for the horticultural maintenance contracts, the number of contractors penalised for failing to meet the contract requirements is as follows (Note):




Year
No. of Contractor

Note: The penalties are based on contracts as the unit. Hence, breakdown by district cannot be provided.

(3) As mentioned above, weed clearance work is part of the regular duties of the relevant departments. Consequently, no additional financial resources have been allocated for this purpose.

(4) Government departments are open to utilising innovative technologies (such as unmanned aircraft) to assist in monitoring work and will consider their appropriate application in carrying out inspections for the black spots with weeds on streets, taking into account the resources involved and their practical effectiveness.

In particular, the HyD has been striving to enhance the repair and maintenance of public roads through the use of innovative technologies. With a view to improving inspection efficiency and accuracy, the HyD has developed the Road Defect Detection System (RDDS), which integrates geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), high-resolution cameras and photogrammetric technologies. Road inspection vehicles equipped with the RDDS can automatically identify road surface cracks and faded road markings. The HyD is pressing ahead with the enhancement and upgrading of the system, and will incorporate a more advanced artificial intelligence algorithm known as the ""Vision Transformer"" in the next-generation system, thereby substantially improving the accuracy and processing speed of image recognition, while expanding detection capabilities to cover matters such as excessive roadside vegetation growth. The HyD will alert the relevant department(s) to step up vegetation trimming and weed clearance, or follow up with the relevant lot owners as appropriate once frequent occurrence of roadside vegetation overgrowth is observed, so as to prevent situations that may affect pedestrian safety."
立法會十題：善用人工智能提升學與教效能,2026-02-04 12:15,2026-02-04 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400183.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上文頴怡議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆︰

問題：

教育局在二○二五年十二月公布推出「『智』啟學教」撥款計劃（「『智』啟學教」計劃），以支援中小學善用人工智能（AI）提升學與教效能，成功申請的學校可獲發一筆過50萬元撥款，用於購置／訂閱／租用推動AI輔助教學的AI裝置／服務，以及資助學生參加能提升其AI素養與技能相關的活動。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於教育局發出的《「『智』啟學教」撥款計劃運用指引》中，把資助教師修讀AI相關課程列為不恰當運用撥款的例子，當中的理據為何；

（二）教育局於二○二五年曾推出「『智』為學理」撥款計劃，安排中學科學科教師報讀有關AI的短期課程，但小學教師未包括在該計劃之內，當局有否推出類似計劃資助小學教師報讀AI培訓課程；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於有學界人士認為，「『智』啟學教」計劃內僅提及目標為「提升學生人工智能素養與技能」，但未有提供清晰的教學指引，當局會否訂明教學框架以供學校跟進；如會，詳情為何；及

（四）就AI素養與技能的教學，當局會否提供系統性的教學資源以支援教師及學校，例如教學資源共享平台等；如會，詳情為何？

答覆：

主席：

二○二五年《施政報告》中提出在優質教育基金預留20億元，以推進數字教育策略發展督導委員會就推動中小學數字教育提出的策略措施，涵蓋優化課程、加強教師培訓、優化數字基建，為學校提供資源支援等。教育局在二○二五年底推出的「『智』啟學教」撥款計劃（「『智』啟學教」計劃），佔上述預留撥款中約五億元，而獲批申請的公帑資助學校各獲發一筆過50萬元撥款，以支持學校按校情和校本優勢推動數字教育，為整體中小學教育數字化轉型注入核心動力。

就文頴怡議員的提問，教育局回覆如下：

優質教育基金轄下的每個計劃，均有其指定的用途，申請獲批的學校須按個別教育計劃的特定範疇使用撥款。「『智』啟學教」計劃按既定機制處理學校申請，主要資助學校購置人工智能工具與資源（包括購買軟件、硬件、訂閱平台及校本人工智能應用方案），以及資助學生參與提升人工智能素養活動，而計劃的重點是支援學校啓動或推動其校本人工智能教育計劃。

（一）獲批申請的學校須按該計劃的既定要求，完成相關的項目，包括將「發展人工智能賦能教育」項目納入學校發展計劃及／或周年計劃，以及在不同科目／課程範疇中推行人工智能輔助教學，並發展教學例子或資源等。基於「『智』啟學教」計劃上述指定撥款用途及參與學校須完成的特定項目，並不包括支援教師修讀培訓課程，故「資助教師修讀AI相關課程」列為不恰當運用撥款的例子。相關要求已於有關通函列明，亦已於簡報會中向學校人員詳細說明。

（二）教育局同樣重視中小學科學教育，加強融入創新及數字教育學習，以及相關專業教師培訓。

二○二四／二五學年推出由優質教育基金支持的「『智』為學理」撥款計劃，以初中科學科為試點，獲批申請的學校可運用撥款，安排科學科教師報讀由專上院校或相關專業機構舉辦有關人工智能輔助教學的短期課程（包括講座及工作坊），支援學校開展人工智能輔助教學。

至於小學科學科，教育局在推出此新學科時，已持續推出「開設小學科學科教師專業培訓系列」、「小學科學與科技教育系列」等課程，通過分享會、示範課、工作坊等，與教師分享和總結教學示例；分享內容包括運用人工智能製作科學概念圖、進行電腦模擬等促進教學，亦介紹如何以微控制器進行探究活動、運用「小學科學網上學習平台」等方式輔助科學學習等，以逐步提升小學教師應用人工智能及電子工具輔助教學的專業能力。這些教師培訓課程由教育局配合課程安排內容，亦會按參與者的回饋優化培訓課程。教育局未有計劃額外資助小學教師報讀外間機構舉辦的培訓課程。

（三）教育局正編訂《中小學數字教育發展藍圖》（《藍圖》），預計今年內發表。《藍圖》涵蓋推展數字教育的方向和策略，重點包括提升學生人工智能素養與技能。此外，教育局同時草擬《人工智能素養學習架構》，並就中小學運用人工智能輔助教學的實踐原則和良好做法舉隅，供學校參考，讓教師有所依循。教育局會持續聽取數字教育策略發展督導委員會及不同持份者的意見，並繼續優化《藍圖》擬稿和相關文件，以協助學校推行數字教育，達至人工智能賦能教育的目的。

（四）教育局一直致力為學校提供優質的教材，包括不同科目的學與教資源，涵蓋學校課程各學習領域及跨學科科目或範疇。因應數字教育發展趨勢，教育局「教育多媒體」平台已初步在部分短片試行推出「AI輔助教學」功能，並將根據意見持續進行開發與完善。教育局又與香港教育城（教城）持續協作，提供切合本地學校需要的一站式電子學習、閱讀及評估服務，包括通過「e悅讀學校計劃」、「學生評估資源庫（STAR）」等平台，配合為學生提供的人工智能和運算思維的網上學習平台和有關課程。此外，教城亦會引入科企的支援，以持續優化相關電子學習資源及平台，進一步達至資源共享的目的。"

Question:

  The Education Bureau (EDB) announced in December 2025 the launch of the AI for Empowering Learning and Teaching Funding Programme (the Funding Programme) to support primary and secondary schools in utilising artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance learning and teaching effectiveness. Successful school applicants will receive one-off funding of $500,000 to purchase/subscribe to/lease AI-powered devices/services that facilitate AI-assisted teaching, and to subsidise students' participation in activities that enhance their AI literacy and skills. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in the Guidelines on the Use of Funding on AI for Empowering Learning and Teaching Funding Programme published by the EDB, subsidising teachers to enrol in AI-related courses is listed as an example of improper use of the funding, of the rationale behind it;

(2) given that the EDB launched in 2025 the AI for Science Education Funding Programme to arrange for secondary school science teachers to enrol in short courses on AI, but primary school teachers were not included in the programme, whether the authorities have launched similar programmes to subsidise primary school teachers to enrol in AI training courses; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that some members of the education sector consider that the Funding Programme only mentions the objective of ""enhancing students' AI literacy and skills"", but does not provide clear teaching guidelines, whether the authorities will specify a teaching framework for schools to follow; if so, of the details; and

(4) as regards the teaching of AI literacy and skills, whether the authorities will provide systematic teaching resources to support teachers and schools, such as platforms for sharing teaching resources; if so, of the details?

Reply:

President,

  As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, $2 billion has been set aside in the Quality Education Fund (QEF) to take forward the strategic measures proposed by the Steering Committee on Strategic Development of Digital Education (Steering Committee) for promoting digital education in primary and secondary schools, which cover optimising curricula, strengthening training for teachers, optimising digital infrastructure, and providing resource support for schools. With an allocation of approximately $500 million from the above funding earmarked, the AI for Empowering Learning and Teaching Funding Programme (the Funding Programme) launched by the Education Bureau (EDB) in late 2025 disburses a one-off funding of $500,000 to each successful publicly-funded school applicant, so as to support their promotion of digital education according to their specific circumstances and school-based advantages. This serves as a core driving force for the overall digital transformation in primary and secondary schools.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Ginny Man is as follows:

  Each programme under the QEF has its designated purposes. Successful school applicants are required to use the funding for the specific areas of individual education programmes. Schools' applications are processed in accordance with the established mechanism under the Funding Programme, which mainly subsidises schools to procure artificial intelligence (AI) tools and resources (including purchase of hardware and software, as well as subscriptions to platforms and school-based AI application solutions), and subsidises students to participate in activities for AI literacy enhancement. The main purpose of the Funding Programme is to support schools in initiating or promoting school-based education programmes related to AI.

(1) Successful school applicants are required to fulfil the prescribed requirements under the Funding Programme, such as incorporating the ""Development of AI-empowered Education"" into the School Development Plan and/or Annual School Plan, and implementing AI-‍assisted teaching in different subjects/curriculum areas with development of teaching examples or learning and teaching resources. The designated purposes of the funding approved and the requirements prescribed for the participating schools under the Funding Programme do not include supporting teachers to enrol in training courses. As such, ""subsidising teachers to enrol in AI-related courses"" is listed as an example of improper use of the funding. This has been specified in the relevant circular memorandum and explained in detail to the school personnel during the briefing sessions.

(2) The EDB attaches equal importance to science education in primary and secondary schools. The EDB has stepped up efforts to integrate learning elements of innovation and digital education and enhance related professional training for teachers.

  Launched with the funding support from the QEF in the 2024/25 school year, the AI for Science Education Funding Programme was for pilot implementation in Junior Secondary Science. Successful school applicants may use the funding to enrol science teachers in short courses (including seminars and workshops) on AI-assisted teaching offered by tertiary institutions or related professional bodies, with a view to supporting the schools in taking forward AI-assisted teaching.

  As for Primary Science, since the introduction of this new subject, the EDB has been offering courses, such as Professional Teacher Training Series for Introduction of Primary Science, and Science and Technology Education Series at Primary Level, to share and consolidate teaching exemplars with teachers through sharing sessions, classroom demonstrations, workshops, etc. The sharing covers the enhancement of teaching effectiveness by, among others, using AI to generate science conceptual diagrams and employing computer simulations, as well as the ways to aid science learning, such as conducting inquiry activities with the use of microcontrollers and accessing the Primary Science Online Learning Platform, so as to progressively enhance the professional competence of primary teachers in using AI and e-tools to assist teaching. These teacher training courses are designed according to the curriculum by the EDB, and will be refined with reference to participants' feedback. At present, the EDB has no plans to further subsidise primary teachers to enrol in training courses offered by external organisations.

(3) The Blueprint for Digital Education Development in Primary and Secondary Schools, which is being formulated by the EDB, is expected to be released within this year. The Blueprint will map out the directions and strategies for implementing digital education, with a focus on enhancing the AI literacy and skills of students. Meanwhile, the EDB is also formulating an AI literacy learning framework and working on illustrations of the implementation principles and good practices for AI-‍assisted teaching in primary and secondary levels for schools' reference and teachers to follow. The EDB will continue to listen to the views of the Steering Committee and other stakeholders, as well as refine the draft Blueprint and relevant documents, with a view to supporting the implementation of digital education in schools to achieve the objective of using AI to empower education.

(4) The EDB is committed to providing schools with quality teaching materials, including learning and teaching resources for different subjects, covering the Key Learning Areas and cross-disciplinary subjects or areas of the school curriculum. In view of the trend of digital education development, the EDB Educational Multimedia platform has launched for some of its short videos a pilot ""AI-assisted teaching"" function, which will undergo continuous development and optimisation according to feedback. The EDB, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Education City (HKEdCity), has also been providing one-stop services on e-learning, e-reading and e-assessment tailored to the needs of local schools, including platforms such as the eRead Scheme and the Student Assessment Repository (STAR), to tie in with the provision of the online learning platform and courses related to AI and computational thinking for students. In addition, the HKEdCity will continue to enhance relevant e-learning resources and platforms with the support of technology enterprises to further achieve the aim of sharing resources."
實踐健康生活和定期接受癌症篩查　響應二○二六年「世界癌症日」,2026-02-04 12:10,2026-02-04 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400272.htm,"​衞生署今日（二月四日）呼籲市民，透過實踐健康生活和定期接受癌症篩查，響應二○二六年「世界癌症日」。

政府十分重視癌症防控工作，自二○○四年開始先後推出子宮頸普查計劃、大腸癌篩查計劃和乳癌篩查先導計劃，透過「早預防、早發現、早治療」，提升患者康復機會。數據顯示，子宮頸癌定期篩查的確診個案中，超過八成屬早期；大腸癌篩查計劃發現的個案逾半屬早期；而乳癌篩查先導計劃第一階段中確診的個案有97%屬早期。由此可見，定期篩查能顯著提升早期癌症個案發現率，提高治癒率。

在剔除人口年齡結構因素後，過去10年間，香港整體癌症的年齡標準化死亡率呈現穩步下降趨勢，其中男性死亡率平均每年顯著下降百分之二點八，女性死亡率平均每年下降百分之一點七。香港癌症病患五年相對存活率在過去10年間提升了10個百分點，達到56%，其中肺癌生存率的提升尤為明顯。由此可見，政府推動癌症預防和控制工作成效顯著。

衞生署衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「癌症是香港多年來的頭號殺手，二○二四年共造成超過15 000人死亡。值得留意的是，肥胖會增加多種癌症如乳腺癌、大腸癌和胰臟癌等的風險；而約四成癌症個案是可以透過採取健康生活方式預防，例如均衡飲食、恆常運動、避免吸煙和飲酒，以及保持健康體重和腰圍。」

衞生署一直推廣健康生活模式作為預防癌症的首要策略，並致力加強公眾對癌症預防和篩查的認識。徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，進行篩查前，應諮詢醫生了解篩查測試的好處和局限，以作出知情決定。市民可到衞生防護中心網頁瀏覽有關健康建議。

為預防子宮頸癌，自二○一九／二○學年起，衞生署在「香港兒童免疫接種計劃」下，為合資格小學女童免費接種人類乳頭瘤病毒（HPV）疫苗，疫苗接種率目前繼續維持於超過九成的極高水平，大大減低香港女性患上子宮頸癌的機會。衞生署並於二○二四年十二月開展一次性補種計劃，為二○○四年至二○○八年出生、尚未完成接種的合資格女性香港居民提供免費補種。目前合資格全日制中學及專上院校女生的第一劑疫苗覆蓋率分別估算為85%及68%。

為預防乙型肝炎（乙肝）病毒感染，政府自一九八八年起為所有新生嬰兒接種乙肝疫苗。現時學童疫苗接種率達99%。根據二○二○至二二年度人口健康調查，35歲以下年齡組別的乙肝感染率已低於1%。除了衞生署的服務外，基層醫療署亦將於二月七日推出「乙型肝炎共同治理計劃」，及早識別社區中的慢性乙肝患者並長期跟進，以減低他們出現肝硬化和肝癌等嚴重併發症的風險。

基層醫療署轄下的地區康健中心亦積極推廣健康人生計劃，為市民制訂不同人生階段的個人化健康策略。康健中心為會員進行健康風險評估，識別和協助持續管理與癌症有關的風險因素，並協助及轉介合資格人士至《基層醫療指南》內參與政府癌症篩查計劃的醫生。康健中心及樂妍站會為有需要市民提供預防乳癌和子宮頸癌的資訊和篩查服務。就綜合社會保障援助計劃受助人或持有有效醫療費用減免證明書的婦女，康健中心會安排她們到指定醫院管理局（醫管局）家庭醫學診所／家庭醫學綜合中心接受包括乳癌和子宮頸癌篩查的婦女預防性保健及健康促進服務。

在治療方面，醫管局則已實施一系列措施提升癌症護理服務。醫管局採取跨專業模式進行診斷服務，為疑似癌症患者提供及時檢查和診斷。醫管局已為疑似肺癌患者在三個聯網推行此服務模式，並會陸續擴展。其轄下醫院由二○二四至二○二五年度起逐步加裝直線加速器，提升癌症治療的服務量。醫管局亦擴大藥物名冊的涵蓋範圍，納入新的癌症治療藥物和擴大現有專用藥物的臨床應用範圍。醫管局以病人為中心，制訂個人化護理計劃，如「癌症個案經理計劃」和「全身性抗癌藥物治療診所服務」，以提供更好支援。

政府會繼續多管齊下推動癌症防控工作，鞏固香港在癌症研究及防控工作的領先地位，並致力優化對癌症病人的服務、為他們提供適切治療。

DH urges public to adopt healthy lifestyle and conduct regular cancer screening in support of World Cancer Day 2026,2026-02-04 12:10,2026-02-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400274.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) today (February 4) urged members of the public to adopt a healthy lifestyle and conduct regular cancer screening in support of World Cancer Day 2026.

The Government attaches great importance to cancer prevention and control. Since 2004, the Cervical Screening Programme, the Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme and the Breast Cancer Screening Pilot Programme (BCSPP) have been sequentially introduced to enhance the recovery rate of patients through ""early prevention, early detection and early treatment"". Data show that over 80 per cent of cervical cancer cases detected through regular cervical screening were in early stages. Among the colorectal cancer cases diagnosed under the Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme, over half were early-stage. Furthermore, 97 per cent of patients diagnosed in Phase I of the BCSPP were at early stages. This indicates that regular screening can significantly increase the detection rate of early-stage cancer cases, thereby improving the recovery rate.

Over the past decade, the age-standardised mortality rate for cancer has shown a steady decline after adjusting for population age structure. Specifically, the cancer mortality rate significantly decreased by 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women on average every year. The five-year relative survival rate of cancer patients in Hong Kong has increased by 10 percentage points over the past decade, reaching 56 per cent, with particularly notable improvements in lung cancer survival rates. These findings demonstrate the significant effectiveness of the Government's initiatives in advancing cancer prevention and control.

""Cancer has been the leading cause of death in Hong Kong for many years, causing over 15 000 deaths in 2024. It is worth noting that obesity increases the risk of various cancers, including breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Approximately 40 per cent of cancer cases can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle, such asa balanced diet, regular exercise, refraining from smoking and alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy body weight and waist circumference,"" the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The DH has been promoting a healthy lifestyle as the primary strategy for cancer prevention and is committed to enhancing public awareness of cancer prevention and screening.Dr Tsui reminds the public to consult their doctors to understand the benefits and limitations of screening tests in order to make an informed decision before undergoing screening. Relevant health advice is available on the website of the CHP.

To prevent cervical cancer, the DH has been providing free human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations to eligible primary schoolgirls under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme since the 2019/20 school year. A high vaccination rate of over 90 per cent has been maintained over the past few years, significantly reducing the risk of cervical cancer in Hong Kong females. The DH also launched a one-off HPV Vaccination Catch-up Programme in December 2024, offering free catch-up vaccinations to female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their HPV vaccination. At present, the estimated first-dose HPV vaccine coverage rates of eligible secondary schoolgirls and post-secondary institution female students in the first two phases are 85 per cent and 68 per cent respectively.

To prevent hepatitis B infection, the Government has been providing hepatitis B vaccines to all newborn babies since 1988. The current vaccination coverage rate among school children has reached 99 per cent. According to the Population Health Survey 2020-22, the prevalence of hepatitis B among those under 35 years old has dropped to below 1 per cent. In addition, the Primary Healthcare Commission will also launch the Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme on February 7 to identify people with chronic hepatitis B in the community at an early stage and provide long-term follow-up services, with a view to reducing their risk of having cirrhosis, liver cancer and other serious complications.

The District Health Centres (DHCs) set up by the Primary Healthcare Commission are actively promoting the Life Course Preventive Care Plan. A personalised preventive care plan is formulated to address the health needs of citizens across different life stages. DHCs identify and assist to continuously manage risk factors associated with cancers through conducting health assessments for DHC members. DHCs assist and refer eligible persons to doctors who have enlisted in the Primary Care Directory and enrolled in the government cancer screening programmes for screening. Meanwhile, DHCs and Women Wellness Satellites also provide members of the public with information related to breast cancer and cervical cancer prevention, related screening services, according to their needs. DHCs will arrange for women who are Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients or holders of valid medical fee waiver certificates to receive preventive care and health promotion services for women, including breast and cervicalcancer screenings, at selected Family Medicine Clinics or Family Medicine Integrated Centres of the Hospital Authority (HA).

The HA has implemented a host of measures to enhance cancer care services. A multidisciplinary approach is adopted for diagnostic services to provide timely investigations and diagnoses for suspected cancer patients. The HA has implemented this service model in three clusters for suspected lung cancer patients and will expand the service in phases. With the installation of new linear accelerators in HA hospitals in phases from 2024-25, the service capacity for cancer treatment will be enhanced. Meanwhile, the HA has also expanded the coverage of the Drug Formulary by incorporating new cancer treatment drugs and broadening the scope of clinical applications of existing Special Drugs. Being patient-centred, the HA has devised personalised care programmes, such as the Cancer Case Manager Programme and Systemic Anti-cancer Therapy Clinic service, to better support patients along their journey.

The Government will continue to adopt a multipronged approach to promote cancer prevention and control and consolidate Hong Kong's leading position in cancer research and prevention and control. The Government is also committed to optimising services and providing appropriate treatment for all cancer patients.

立法會十七題：推動無紙化的政策措施,2026-02-04 12:03,2026-02-04 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400305.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上李鎮強議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

政府部門一直積極推動環保政策及措施，當中包括辦公室「無紙化」。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，過去五年每年所有政府部門的總耗紙量為何（以表列出）；

（二）有否計劃協調相關政府部門及公用事業機構，安排公共服務帳單（例如水費、電費、煤氣費、差餉及稅單等）在「智方便」平台統一發放及處理；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）政府有否就推動政府及社會以「無紙化」方式通訊制訂具體的政策及計劃；如有，詳情及時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢環境及生態局和財經事務及庫務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）政府一向重視環保及減廢回收工作，環境保護署透過制定內部指引，要求各政策局／部門（局／部門）從源頭減少廢物，包括雙面使用紙張、回收再造廢紙，以及優先採用電子方式（如網頁、電郵）發布資訊，以減少使用紙張。各局／部門每年須編寫並在其網站上發布環保工作報告，闡述他們在日常運作中維持環保管理的具體行動，其中包括節約用紙的相關措施，但政府沒有就各部門的總用紙量作出年度統計。

（二）為推動電子化政務服務及減少用紙，政府透過「智方便」一站式個人化數碼服務平台加強整合公共服務帳單的發放及處理，同時支援電子支付選項，以提升公共服務效率，亦有助節省行政開支與紙張耗用，推動優化資源。

現時，「智方便」已支援超過1 300項政府及公私營機構的網上服務及電子表格，包括水務署的「水務易」、差餉物業估價署的「差餉地租單」、稅務局的「稅務易」、香港電燈有限公司（港燈）的「港燈網上通」、香港中華煤氣有限公司（中華煤氣）的「煤氣網上客戶中心」，以及中華電力有限公司的「中電One」流動應用程式。市民可透過「智方便」登入相關服務，查閱及處理各項公共服務帳單。「智方便」個人助理頁面的帳單功能亦已支援水務署的水費單及港燈的電費單繳付，此外，中華煤氣及稅務局的相關功能亦即將推出，以便利市民電子查閱及繳費，從而減少使用紙本帳單及收據，進一步推動公共服務無紙化。

（三）目前，所有政府部門已採用「智方便」為市民提供方便和一站式的電子服務。「智方便」的登記用戶已超過410萬，每日使用量超過18萬人次，實現政府服務「一網通辦」的目標。政府一直積極透過不同渠道向市民宣傳及推廣「智方便」，介紹各項服務和功能，讓他們了解「智方便」所帶來的便利，亦有助推動無紙化。

此外，數字政策辦公室聯同政府檔案處已於二○二五年年底在各部門全面推行電子檔案保管系統，使部門能夠以電子方式保存及管理檔案，提升效率，減少用紙。

在社會及企業方面，二○二五年四月十七日起，政府實施新安排，容許公司採用默示同意機制透過網站向股東發布通訊，推動本地公司以無紙化方式作出公司通訊。此外，政府亦透過推行電子投標系統，鼓勵採購無紙化。

政府各局及部門會繼續採取措施，推動政府及社會「無紙化」的通訊和業務。"
LCQ17: Policy initiatives to promote paperless practices,2026-02-04 12:03,2026-02-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020400313.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lee Chun-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

 Government departments have been actively promoting environmental protection policies and measures, including ""paperless"" practices in offices. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the total paper consumption of all government departments in each of the past five years (set out in a table);

(2) whether it has plans to co-ordinate relevant government departments and public utilities to arrange for the unified issuance and processing of utility bills (such as water, electricity and gas charges, rates and tax demand notes) on the ""iAM Smart"" platform; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the Government has formulated specific policies and plans to promote the use of ""paperless"" communication by the Government and the community; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

​In consultation with the Environment and Ecology Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The Government has all along attached great importance to environmental protection, waste reduction and recycling. The Environmental Protection Department has issued internal guidelines requiring all bureaux and departments (B/Ds) to take measures to reduce waste at source, including double-sided printing, recycling of waste paper, and prioritising the use of electronic means, such as websites and emails, for information dissemination with a view to minimising paper consumption. Each B/D is required to publish an annual environmental report on its website, setting out the actions taken to uphold environmental management in their daily operations, including relevant measures to reduce paper consumption. However, the Government does not compile annual statistics on the total paper consumption of all departments.

(2)To promote e-government services and reduce paper usage, the Government has strengthened the integration of issuance and processing of utility bills through ""iAM Smart"", the one-stop personalised digital services platform, while supporting electronic payment options. This not only improves the efficiency of public services but also helps reduce administrative costs and paper consumption, thereby optimising resources utilisation.

At present, ""iAM Smart"" supports over 1 300 online services and e-forms provided by the Government as well as public and private organisations, including the ""eWater"" service of the Water Supplies Department (WSD), the ""eRVD"" bill service of the Rating and Valuation Department, ""eTax"" of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), ""Account-On-Line"" of the Hongkong Electric Company Limited (HK Electric), the ""Towngas eService Centre"" of the Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited (Towngas), and the ""CLP One"" mobile app of the CLP Power Hong Kong Limited. Citizens can log in to relevant services via ""iAM Smart"" to view and manage various utility bills. The ""Bills"" function on the ""iAM Smart"" personal assistant page already supports payment of water and electricity bills from the WSD and HK Electric respectively. In addition, relevant functions for Towngas and the IRD will be launched soon. These initiatives facilitate electronic viewing and payment by citizens, thereby reducing the use of paper bills and receipts and further advancing the ""paperless"" delivery of public services.

(3)At present, all government departments have adopted ""iAM Smart"" to provide convenient and one-stop online services for citizens. The number of registered users has exceeded 4.1 million, with more than 180 000 daily usages, achieving the goal of providing a single portal for online government services. The Government has been actively promoting ""iAM Smart"" through various channels, introducing its services and functions to citizens with a view to helping them understand the convenience it brings, which in turn helps drive ""paperless"" practices.

In addition, the Digital Policy Office and the Government Records Service have fully implemented the electronic recordkeeping system across all departments by the end of 2025. This enables departments to store and manage records electronically, which helps enhance efficiency and reduce paper use.

As regards society and corporations, since April 17, 2025, the Government has implemented new arrangement to allow companies to adopt implied consent mechanism for disseminating corporate communication by means of website, in order to promote ""paperless"" corporate communication for Hong Kong companies. The Government also promotes ""paperless"" procurement through implementing the e-Tendering System.

Various B/Ds will continue to take measures to promote ""paperless"" communication and operations in the Government and in society."

立法會十二題：鞏固香港債券中心地位,2026-02-04 12:00,2026-02-04 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020300584.htm,"以下是今日（二月四日）在立法會會議上李惟宏議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

《2025年施政報告》提出，政府會推進鞏固香港債券中心地位，包括提升市場流動性、推動使用離岸中國國債作為不同清算所抵押品，以及在港推出離岸國債期貨等。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見指出，不少上市債券的成交薄弱，政府有何措施激活債券市場，從而提升相關債券的成交額；會否促請監管機構重新審視專業投資者的資格要求，以及降低相關債券的入場門檻，讓更多零售投資者參與債券交易；

（二）就推動使用離岸中國國債作為不同清算所抵押品，目前有否具體落實時間表；政府會否研究，推動不同清算所將抵押品的適用範圍逐步擴大至包括歐元區國債及其他經濟發達國家主權債券；

（三）政府有何措施加快落實在港推出離岸國債期貨的政策；會否考慮推出其他經濟發達國家主權債券期貨產品；及

（四）鑑於政府在二○二五至二○二六財政年度的《財政預算案》宣布，會積極探討將已發行的傳統債券代幣化，現時有關政策的實施進度為何；會否考慮在有關代幣化的過程中，引入更多零售投資者和金融中介機構參與？

答覆：

主席︰

政府一直致力推動本地債券市場的發展，務求令香港作為國際金融中心能發揮更多元化的功能。透過以創新的形式定期發行政府債券（包括機構、零售、綠色和代幣化債券等）激活市場、提升市場基礎建設，及推行發行資助（如綠色和可持續金融資助計劃）和稅務優惠（如合資格債務票據計劃）等措施，香港已發展成亞洲區的國際債券發行樞紐。以安排亞洲機構向國際發行的債券規模計算，香港從二○○八年起連續十七年為區內第一，其中十年更位居世界第一，二○二四年通過香港安排的發行規模超過1,300億美元，市場份額達到近百分之三十。其中，香港更分別佔首次債券發行市場約百分之七十，以及綠色和可持續債券發行市場的百分之四十五，印證了香港在各細分領域中均處於領先地位。此外，香港離岸人民幣債券市場近年發展蓬勃，離岸人民幣債券發行金額在二○二四年達1.07萬億元人民幣，按年上升百分之三十七，亦自二○一七年起連續七年錄得增長。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出，將持續構建領先的債券市場及蓬勃的貨幣市場。政府與金融監管機構正推展一系列措施，包括促進一級市場發行、促進二級市場流動性、擴展離岸人民幣業務及新世代基建，進一步鞏固香港作為固定收益及貨幣中心的策略性地位。證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）與香港金融管理局（金管局）於二○二五年九月聯合發布《固定收益及貨幣市場發展路線圖》（《路線圖》）詳述有關措施。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢金管局、證監會及香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所），現回覆如下：

（一）就上市債券目前的情況，截至二○二六年一月二日，港交所共有1 351隻上市債券，當中1 302隻為根據《上市規則》第三十七章向專業投資者發行的債券（第三十七章債券）。雖然第三十七章債券於港交所上市，該等債券一般主要於場外（OTC）買賣，而非在港交所內進行。此外，債券通常屬於持有至到期的投資產品，投資者購買債券往往持有至到期，因此第三十七章債券在交易所市場流通性方面可能較為有限。

有別於向零售投資者發售的債券，第三十七章提供簡化及快捷的債券上市流程，港交所採取較為寬鬆的方式進行審批。由於第三十七章並沒有訂明可上市的債券類型，當中具備特殊或複雜特徵的債券（例如屬永續性質或後償性質，或具有浮息或延遲派付利息條款的債券）均可按第三十七章上市，有關債券或未必適合零售投資者。

為了提升整體債券市場的流動性，證監會正研究由市場建立和營運的債券電子化交易平台的可行性。就此，證監會已委任外部顧問，並已開始與市場參與者、市場營運者及監管機構進行訪談。與此同時，證監會亦正積極推動在香港建立商業回購市場和中央交易對手制度，包括就有關的結算系統展開可行性研究。我們會繼續積極推展上述《路線圖》列舉的有關措施，務求從提升市場效率和交易透明度，以及減低對手方信用風險等方面，為本港債券市場的進一步發展構建穩固基礎。

（二）港交所一直致力提升香港證券及衍生品市場的活力及競爭力。香港場外結算公司自二○二五年一月起已開始接受境外投資者使用債券通持倉中的在岸國債和政策性金融債作為北向互換通的履約抵押品，並在同年三月起將安排拓展至所有衍生品交易。有關措施能夠進一步拓寬在岸人民幣債券在離岸市場作為抵押品的用途，為國際投資者提供更大的靈活性和提高資本效率，進一步增強人民幣資產的吸引力，推動人民幣國際化。港交所將繼續與市場各方緊密合作，持續檢討相關抵押品安排，在平衡各種風險下探索納入新產品，為投資者提供更多元化的抵押選擇，進一步鞏固香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐和領先風險管理中心的地位。

（三）政府、金融監管機構和港交所一直致力深化及擴大兩地資本市場互聯互通。在中央人民政府大力支持下，債券通、跨境理財通、交易所買賣基金納入互聯互通標的、互換通等多項增量擴容措施近年已相繼落實。其中，截至二○二五年十二月底，境外機構透過債券通等渠道持有內地債券的總規模超過34,000億元人民幣，債券通北向通的日均成交量二○二五年達約390億元人民幣。

隨着環球投資者對以人民幣計價產品的需求日趨殷切，香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐和風險管理中心的角色越見重要。香港特別行政區政府致力不斷豐富人民幣計價投資產品和風險管理工具，以滿足海內外投資者的需要。兩地監管機構已宣布支持在香港推出離岸國債期貨，為在港投資國債引入有效的離岸風險管理工具。相關籌備工作已大致完成，證監會會繼續與港交所緊密合作落實措施。

此外，港交所會繼續致力豐富其衍生產品庫，對於發行新產品，包括其他經濟體資產為標的的衍生品持積極開放態度。

（四）政府自二○二三年起已發行三批代幣化綠色債券，並會在日後持續發行代幣化債券，期望為市場帶來示範作用，及提供高質量的代幣化債券供應，從而推動香港代幣化債券市場的更廣泛發展。例如，於二○二五年十一月發行的代幣化綠色債券，成功擴大市場參與，發行金額達100億港元，為當時全球最大的代幣化債券發行。此批債券受廣泛環球機構投資者歡迎，包括不少首次認購代幣化債券的投資者，總認購金額超過1,300億港元等值。與以往的發行相比，安排銀行及相關數碼資產平台的直接參與者數量也有所增加。

為提升代幣化債券的吸引力及需求，金管局亦正研究代幣化債券的二級市場應用場景，例如以數碼原生債券和代幣化的已發行傳統債券作為回購融資抵押品，研究結果將會適時公布。此外，政府和金管局正共同研究現行的法律框架，以探討優化措施，從而推動代幣化技術在香港債券市的更廣泛應用。

零售投資者參與方面，金管局早前透過與國際結算銀行創新樞紐合作進行的Project Genesis完成概念認證。不過，要實現相關概念涉及法律、科技和操作等多個層面，並需要整個發行鏈不同參與者的配合。金管局亦正在評估目前形式的代幣化債券是否能夠滿足零售投資者的需求。政府及監管機構會繼續與業界溝通，探索如何有效及適當地將代幣化債券應用於零售層面。"
LCQ12: Consolidating Hong Kong's position as a bond market hub,2026-02-04 12:00,2026-02-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/04/P2026020300582.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Robert Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (February 4):

Question:

 The 2025 Policy Address proposed that the Government would further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a bond market hub, including, among others, improving market liquidity, promoting the use of offshore Chinese Government Bonds as collateral in different clearing houses, and introducing offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views pointing out that many listed bonds have weak trading volumes, what measures the Government has put in place to invigorate the bond market and thereby increase the trading volumes of such bonds; whether it will urge the regulatory bodies to re-‍examine the qualification requirements for professional investors and lower the entry threshold for such bonds, so that more retail investors can engage in bond trading;

(2) whether there is currently a specific implementation timetable for promoting the use of offshore Chinese Government Bonds as collateral in different clearing houses; whether the Government will study promoting in different clearing houses the gradual expansion of the range of acceptable collateral to include eurozone government bonds and sovereign bonds from other economically developed countries;

(3) what measures the Government has put in place to expedite the implementation of the policy to introduce offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong; whether it will consider introducing futures products of sovereign bonds from other economically developed countries; and

(4) as the Government announced in the 2025-2026 Budget that it would actively explore tokenising traditional bonds issued, of the current progress of implementing the relevant policy; whether it will consider engaging more retail investors and financial intermediaries in the relevant tokenisation process?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been striving to promote the development of the local bond market, with a view to enabling Hong Kong performing a more diversified function as an international financial centre. Through providing impetus to the market by issuing government bonds regularly in innovative ways (such as issuance of institutional, retail, green and tokenised bonds), enhancing market infrastructure, as well as issuance subsidy schemes (e.g. the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme) and tax incentive schemes (e.g. the Qualifying Debt Instrument Scheme) and others, Hong Kong has developed into a hub for international bond issuance in Asia. In terms of bonds issued internationally by Asia-based entities, Hong Kong ranked first in the region for seventeen consecutive years since 2008, with ten years ranking first globally. The volume of Asian international bonds arranged in Hong Kong totalled over US$130 billion and accounted for around 30 per cent of the market in 2024. Among these issuances, Hong Kong has captured around 70 per cent of debut issuances, and 45 per cent green and sustainable bond issuances, demonstrating our leading position in different segments. Meanwhile, offshore RMB (Renminbi) bond market in Hong Kong recorded solid development over the past few years, with offshore RMB bond issuance reaching RMB1.07 trillion in 2024, having increased by 37 per cent year-on-year and expanded for seven years in a row since 2017.

 As stated in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, we will continue to expand a world-class bond market and a vibrant currency market. The Government and financial regulators are taking forward a series of measures, including boosting issuance in primary market, enhancing liquidity in secondary market, expanding offshore Renminbi business, and next-generation infrastructure, with a view to further consolidating Hong Kong's strategic position as a leading Fixed Income and Currency (FIC) hub. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) jointly announced the Roadmap for the Development of FIC Markets (Roadmap) in September 2025 which outlined the relevant initiatives.

 After consultation with the HKMA, the SFC and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), the reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Regarding the current situation of listed bonds, as of January 2, 2026, there were 1 351 listed bonds on HKEX, of which 1 302 were issued to professional investors under Chapter 37 of the Listing Rules (Chapter 37 Bonds). While Chapter 37 Bonds are listed on HKEX, such bonds are generally traded over-the-counter rather than on HKEX. Moreover, bonds are typically held-to-maturity investment products, with investors often purchasing them with the intention of holding until maturity, therefore Chapter 37 Bonds may not have ample liquidity in the listed market.

 In contrast to bonds offered to retail investors, Chapter 37 offers a streamlined and expedient listing process for bonds under which HKEX adopts a ""light touch"" approach for vetting. Since Chapter 37 does not prescribe the type of bonds that could be listed and accordingly bonds with special or complex features (such as perpetual or subordinated bonds, or those with variable or deferred interest payment terms) could be listed under Chapter 37, relevant bonds may not be suitable for retail investors.

 To enhance the overall bond market liquidity, the SFC is studying the feasibility of an electronic bond-trading platform built and operated by market participants. In this regard, the SFC has appointed external consultants, and has begun interviews with market participants, market operators and regulatory authorities. Meanwhile, the SFC is also actively promoting the establishment of a commercial repo (repurchase) market and a central counterparty regime in Hong Kong, including conducting a feasibility study on setting up the relevant clearing system. We are committed to implementing the initiatives outlined in the Roadmap continuously, with a view to establishing a solid foundation for the further development of our bond market development, through enhancing market efficiency and transaction transparency, as well as reducing counterparty credit risk.

(2) HKEX is committed to enhancing the vitality and competitiveness of Hong Kong's securities and derivatives markets. Since January 2025, the OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited has started accepting onshore Chinese Government Bonds and Policy Bank Bonds held by offshore investors through Bond Connect as collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions, and extended the arrangement to all derivative transactions from March of the same year. The measure could further broaden the use of onshore Renminbi bonds as collateral in offshore markets, offering international investors greater flexibility and improved capital efficiency. This further enhances the attractiveness of RMB assets and advances RMB internationalisation. HKEX will continue to collaborate closely with market participants, regularly review relevant collateral arrangements, and explore incorporating new products while balancing various risks. These will provide investors with more diversified collateral options, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as a global offshore RMB business hub and a leading risk management centre.

(3) The Government, financial regulators and HKEX are committed to deepening and broadening the mutual access between the Mainland and Hong Kong capital markets. With the strong support of the Central People's Government, a series of expansion measures were implemented in recent years successively, including Bond Connect, Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect, inclusion of exchange-traded funds under mutual access, Swap Connect, etc. Notably, as of end-December 2025, the total amount of foreign holdings of Mainland onshore bonds through different channels including Bond Connect exceeded RMB3,400 billion. The average daily turnover of Northbound Bond Connect in 2025 reached about RMB39 billion.

 As global investors' demand for RMB-denominated products grows, Hong Kong's role as a global offshore RMB business hub and risk management centre becomes increasingly important. The Government is committed to continuously enriching the suite of RMB-denominated investment products and risk management tools to meet the needs of both domestic and overseas investors. The regulators of the Mainland and Hong Kong have announced their support for the launch of offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong, introducing an effective offshore risk management tool for investing in Chinese Government Bonds in Hong Kong. The relevant preparatory work has been largely completed. The SFC will continue to work closely with HKEX to implement the measure.

 In addition, HKEX will continue to expand its derivatives product suite and maintain a positive and open stance towards issuing new products, including derivatives with assets from other economies as underlying assets.

(4) The Government has issued three tranches of tokenised green bonds since 2023. Through continuous tokenised bond issuances, the Government expects to promote the broader development of Hong Kong's tokenised bond market by creating demonstrative effects and supplying the market with high quality tokenised bonds. For instance, the tokenised green bond issuance in November 2025 successfully scaled up market participation, with an issuance size of HK$10 billion, marking the world's largest tokenised bond at the time. This issuance was well received by a wide spectrum of global institutional investors, including a substantial number of first-time tokenised bond investors, reaching a total subscription amount over HK$130 billion. Compared to the previous issuances, the number of arranging banks and direct participants to the relevant digital assets platform also increased.

 To enhance the attractiveness and demand for tokenised bonds, the HKMA is also exploring secondary market applications of tokenised bonds, which include using digitally native bonds and tokenised version of existing bonds as collaterals for repo financing. Results of the study will be announced in due course. In addition, the Government is working with the HKMA to review the current legal regime and identify potential enhancements, with a view to promoting the wider adoption of tokenisation in Hong Kong's bond market.

 Regarding retail investor participation, in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub, the HKMA completed a proof-of-concept study through Project Genesis. However, implementation of the relevant concept would involve multiple aspects, including legal, technical, and operational aspects, and would require collaboration among various parties in the entire issuance chain. At the same time, the HKMA is also assessing whether the current form of tokenised bonds can meet the needs of retail investors. The Government and regulators will continue to engage with the industry to explore how tokenised bonds can be effectively and suitably applied at the retail level."

食安中心呼籲市民不要食用一批嬰兒配方奶粉,2026-02-03 22:58,2026-02-03 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300849.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（食安中心）繼續積極跟進全球不同地區因個別批次的嬰幼兒配方奶粉可能存在源自微生物蠟樣芽孢桿菌（Bacillus cereus）的物質而作預防性回收的事件。食安中心今日（二月三日）表示，早前透過食物事故監測系統得悉德國當局回收個別批次的愛他美（Aptamil）嬰幼兒奶粉產品，因為有關產品可能含有蠟樣芽孢桿菌的耐熱毒素（Cereulide）。食安中心十分關注事件並已即時作出跟進，包括聯絡本地進口商、零售商及有關當局，以及巡查市面的零售點。食安中心早前亦已在網上發布食物事故報表，讓公眾和業界知悉事件。根據今日最新調查結果，有本地零售商曾出售小量的一個受影響批次嬰兒配方奶粉。為審慎起見，有關零售商已按食安中心指示將受影響產品停售和下架，並展開預防性的回收。

產品資料如下：

產品名稱：Aptamil Profutura DUO Pre D 800g
品牌：Aptamil
包裝：八百克
來源地：德國
進口數量：54罐
此日期或之前食用：二○二七年四月二十日
零售商：Baby HK

食安中心初步調查顯示，相關進口商曾進口九箱共54罐涉事產品，當中34罐已分銷。中心已指令有關零售商將涉事批次產品停售及下架，並回收相關產品。此外，食安中心亦已隨即將20罐餘貨封存。市民可於辦公時間致電商戶熱線3586 1399查詢上述產品的回收事宜。

食安中心會繼續加強在市面抽檢嬰幼兒配方奶粉，並會繼續密切監察相關回收事宜，全力保障食物安全。食安中心已就事件通知業界及相關部門，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當跟進行動。跟進調查工作仍然繼續。

蠟樣芽孢桿菌普遍存在於環境中。如製作或貯存食品的過程欠缺衞生，可引致該菌繁殖。致吐毒素是由一些蠟樣芽孢桿菌菌株在食物中產生的耐熱毒素。進食含過量蠟樣芽孢桿菌或其耐熱毒素的食物，可能引致腸胃不適，例如嘔吐及腹瀉。

CFS urges public not to consume batch of powdered infant formula,2026-02-03 22:58,2026-02-03 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300850.htm,"​The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department continues to actively follow up on the precautionary recall of certain batches of powdered infant and young children formula in different areas worldwide due to possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus in the individual raw material. The CFS today (February 3) said it earlier noted through its Food Incident Surveillance System that certain batches of Aptamil powdered infant and young children formula are being recalled by the German authority as the products might contain Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus. The CFS has been very concerned about the incident, and has followed up immediately, including contacting the local importers, retailers and relevant authorities, as well as inspecting retail outlets in the market. The CFS has earlier published a food incident post online to inform the public and the trade of the incident. According to the latest investigation result today, a local retailer had sold a small quantity of one affected batch of the powdered infant formula concerned. For the sake of prudence, the retailer concerned has stopped sales, removed from shelves the affected product and has initiated a precautionary recall according to the CFS's instructions.

  Product details are as follows:

Product name: Aptamil Profutura DUO Pre D 800g
Brand: Aptamil
Pack size: 800 grams
Place of origin: Germany
Quantity imported: 54 cans
Use-by date: April 20, 2027
Retailer: Baby HK

  A preliminary investigation by the CFS revealed that relevant importer had imported nine boxes of 54 cans of the product concerned, among which 34 cans had been distributed. The CFS has instructed the retailer concerned to stop sales and remove from shelves the affected batch of the product concerned and to initiate a recall. Moreover, the CFS has marked and sealed 20 cans of remaining stock of the product. Members of the public may call the retailer's hotline at 3586 1399 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

  The CFS will continue to enhance surveillance of powdered infant and young children formula and to closely monitor the recall matters and remain fully committed to ensuring food safety. The CFS has alerted the trade and relevant department over the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. Follow-up investigation is ongoing.

  Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Cereulide is a heat-stable toxin produced in food by some strains of Bacillus cereus. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus or its heat-stable toxins may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

  The CFS urged members of the public not to let infants and young children consume the affected batch of the product, and to seek medical treatment for infants or young children who felt unwell after taking the product concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately.

  The CFS has established a designated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/whatsnew/powdered_formula/index.html) to facilitate public access to more information."

財政司司長出席2025年品牌選舉頒獎典禮暨晚宴致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2026-02-03 19:48,2026-02-03 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300716.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（二月三日）出席2025年品牌選舉頒獎典禮暨晚宴的致辭：

盧金榮會長（香港中華廠商聯合會（廠商會）會長兼香港品牌發展局名譽主席）、陳家偉主席（香港品牌發展局主席）、各位主禮嘉賓、各位業界同仁、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興再次出席香港品牌發展局（品牌局）的品牌選舉頒獎典禮，與各位一同嘉許和支持今年表現卓越的優秀品牌。

品牌局自二○○五年成立以來，一直積極推動香港品牌的發展，持續提升香港品牌在國際上的地位與知名度。品牌選舉頒獎典禮至今已舉辦超過二十年，成為本港商界一年一度的盛事。在此，我對廠商會、品牌局及業界同仁長期以來的努力與貢獻，表示由衷的謝意！

品牌代表着對品質與價值的堅持，這亦是我們珍而重之的香港聲譽。多年來，「香港」這個品牌在國際上廣受認同，除了在金融、專業服務等領域不斷求進、精益求精以外，更離不開優質的香港產品和服務，離不開在座各位企業家深耕細作、不懈努力。

當前，全球經貿格局正經歷深刻變化，新一輪科技創新與產業變革加速演進，新產品、新消費模式不斷湧現。在此背景下，香港品牌應如何進一步提升競爭力，在全球市場中脫穎而出呢？

在座各位都是商業翹楚和行銷專家，相信大家會有自己的答案。在此，我也想結合當前經濟與科技的發展趨勢，分享幾點觀察：

第一，把握國家擴大內需、消費升級的機遇。大家都知道，中國是製造大國，但隨着中等收入群體迅速增長，內地對高品質產品和服務的需求將大幅增加，巨大消費潛力正逐步被釋放。國務院副總理何立峰上月在世界經濟論壇上提出，中國正大力提振消費，成為消費大國，會進一步擴大進口，鼓勵全球更多優質商品進入中國市場。

在這個過程中，香港必須擁抱新的機遇。隨着內地超大規模市場進一步開放，可以預見會有更多海內外的企業會更有興趣進入內地市場。香港對內地市場的熟悉度、進入的便捷度，以至是CEPA（《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》）下的優惠待遇，是我們的獨特優勢。對於本港的品牌而言，與全球的優質產品和品牌聯乘合作、不斷創新，相信能夠開創新的增長路徑。

第二，是消費者從「功能需求」到「價值追求」的轉變。

如今的消費者不僅追求產品的功能，更重視體驗、情感連結與文化內涵。舉一個例子：近期在西九文化區舉辦的大型古埃及文明展，除了展覽本身，那隻法老貓，以至周邊的文創IP（知識產權）產品，亦同樣「爆紅」。這些產品之所以熱賣，我相信除了它們設計可愛、討人喜歡之外，亦因為它們將展覽內容和文明故事與產品緊扣，與消費者建立了情感共鳴。大家都可能已注意到，過去一兩年，文創IP，不論是動漫或遊戲，通過對文化和生活的演繹，都掀起了熱潮。

這些現象為我們帶來了一些啓示。如何為產品構建動人的「品牌敘事」，傳遞獨特的價值與體驗，打動消費者，值得花心思。

第三，積極擁抱科技發展與數字化的大趨勢。

科技不僅能提升產品的功能與品質，也是行銷和拓展市場的關鍵，其中加強發展電商業務是必由之路。事實上，香港品牌在世界各地都有相當好的口碑，東南亞是我們需要進一步開拓的市場。香港貿易發展局過去兩年舉辦的「香港好物節」，很受歡迎，貿發局今年和未來兩年會繼續舉辦這個活動，並將它由內地拓展至東盟的電商市場，支持香港產品直達這些地區的消費者。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，過去一年香港經濟穩中向好，出口表現強勁，旅客持續增加，提升了本地品牌的能見度。我期待和大家繼續勇於嘗試、敢於創新，開拓更多新產品、新體驗與新市場，讓「香港品牌」更光更亮。特區政府將繼續與業界並肩同行，全力支持大家的工作。

最後，農曆馬年將至，預祝各位龍馬精神、身體健康、財源廣進、家庭幸福！謝謝大家！"

CHP investigates two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters,2026-02-03 19:46,2026-02-03 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300720.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (February 3) investigating two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters affecting a total of six persons. The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

The clusters involve two males and four females aged between 21 and 26. They developed diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea and fever about 20 to 35 hours after having dinner at Dol Dam Gil Korean Restaurant located at Shop 20, 22, G/F, Wing Lee Building, 27-33 Kimberley Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, on January 28 and 29 respectively.

Five of the affected persons sought medical advice but did not require hospitalisation.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that pre-shucked oysters and soy sauce marinated crab were the food items that the affected individuals had in common at the aforementioned restaurant. Officers of the CHP and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch) conducted a joint investigation and examined the handling processes and food hygiene at the restaurant. Environmental samples were also collected for testing. The CFS's field investigation revealed that the affected persons may have contracted food poisoning from consuming raw food. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to suspend serving the incriminated food items and to carry out cleaning and disinfection of the premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises.

The investigation of the CHP and the CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children, are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and
Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet.

火鍋或燒烤時，確保食物已徹底煮熟才進食；
在烹煮過程中，小心處理並要徹底分開生和熟的食物；
使用兩套筷子及用具分開處理生及熟的食物；
不要光顧無牌食物檔；
飲用經煮沸的水；
高危人士（包括免疫力較低的人、長者、孕婦及幼童）患食源性疾病的風險較高，故不應進食生或未經徹底煮熟的食物；
不要試圖用鹽、醋、酒及日本芥末殺菌，因為均沒有殺菌效用；及
進食前及如廁後要洗手。

記者：昨日政府發出了新聞稿，對那位離世的社署社工表示哀悼，有報道說他是參與「一戶一社工」的社工，想確認消息是否屬實？如果他是負責「一戶一社工」的話，現在要密集處理受宏福苑大火影響居民是否對「一戶一社工」造成壓力？局方或署方會否有措施去應對？

另外，早前曾說過今個月內會提交地盤禁煙的草案給立法會，現在進度是怎樣？工會調查亦提到有工友對於早前提到15萬元的最高罰則有點擔心，你自己怎樣看？會否因為這些意見而降低最高罰款？謝謝。

勞工及福利局局長：我和署長（社會福利署署長杜永恒）都很痛心有社署社工同事離開了我們，他一向都是盡心盡責、勤奮、幹練的同事，我們心感沉痛，也第一時間對他的家屬提供了必要的支援，亦在此向他們致以最深切的慰問。

大家都知道社工同事的工作量一向都十分繁重，在宏福苑大火後，社署全體出動，署長也多次表示社署現時約有2 000位社工，而宏福苑「一戶一社工」總共對應了1 982戶居民，這等於我們要從約2 000位的社工裏，調動1 982位同事去負責「一戶一社工」。即使大家工作繁重，我們欣悉同事是全力以赴的，他們希望盡自己最大的努力幫到有需要、受影響的居民。在過程中，很多居民都寫了很多很貼心的感謝說話，過程中亦感受到社會是認同「一戶一社工」的工作，亦體諒大家的努力，所以在工作方面大家要盡力而為，在工作之餘盡力而為去幫忙。

那位不幸離世的同事，因為基本上社署是全體出動的，所以他是「一戶一社工」的一員。但希望大家體諒，因為社署第一時間已接觸離世同事的家屬，他們再三叮囑說希望保持低調，不希望這件事在公共空間有太多的討論，所以我們希望大家尊重家屬的意願。我們只可以提供這些資料，但對於同事的離去我們感到十分沉痛和難過。大家可以放心，署長和社署同事一定會全力支援離世同事的家屬。

至於第二條問題，就關於在地盤實施全面禁煙，先前我曾說過會通過修訂附屬法例實施在地盤全面禁煙。在這裡我也想藉這個機會跟大家說明，如果用我早前所說的辦法，即修訂香港法例第59章《工廠及工業經營條例》的話，那是涉及工廠和職安健條例，這條例是沒有定額罰款的，條例的罰則是用最高罰款，然後通過法庭進行判決。我們的確留意到，當政府說了初步構想後，有不少工友反映雖然同意地盤全面禁煙，這個我們是高興的，因為這和社會共識一樣，不過他們提出擔憂，表示如果最高罰款是15萬元，他們感到擔心。即使我們知道法例最高罰款是15萬元，但經過法庭的裁決後其實不一定是這個數額的，我們見過類似的判刑，要視乎它不同的類型，罰款是介乎數千或數萬元。但我們理解工友們的擔憂，所以政府現時正積極構想，希望可以盡快構想一個方案處理工友的擔憂。

即是說我們或許可以找到一個途徑，如果將來實施地盤全面禁煙後，如發現工友吸煙，罰則會是一個定額罰款，最好和現時在《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》下的罰則一樣，即三千元。如果要這樣修改，我們要多花一點時間看看怎樣做，可能不只是修改職安健條例的，其中一個可能性是要修改《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》，這可能需要配合，我們需要多點時間，做好了我們會第一時間和大家說明。我們明白有些擔憂是合理的，所以我們要多些時間想清楚當中的細節，當我們想通了細節，確保每一步都行得通，我們會盡快向大家交代。但大原則很清晰，大家都渴望看到在地盤實施全面禁煙，這個無論是社會人士，我都很欣慰見到工友都覺得應該是這樣做的，只是細節怎樣去執行，尤其是如果他不小心在地盤吸煙，相關罰則怎樣做才會令他安心，和令他覺得公允，我覺得政府要仔細考慮一下，會盡快跟大家說明。

記者：剛才局長提到那位離世的「一戶一社工」，想問那戶災民是否已經有另一位社工接手？會否出現是一名社工要兼顧兩戶災民的情況？另外想問關於照顧者，較早前醫院管理局和社署有互通平台，若照顧者入院，社署會派人跟進，但有組織關注現時服務只限於領取照顧者津貼的人，將來會否擴展到香港綜合社會保障援助（綜援）受助人或長者生活津貼的受惠人？

勞工及福利局局長：第一個問題我待會請署長講解一下，按我理解已編配了另一位社工去跟進該住戶，待會署長可補充。關於照顧者資料庫的數據安排，你剛提到現時主要針對正領取低收入照顧者津貼的人士，一旦照顧者入院，我們擔心他們可能未來得及處理好被其照顧的人士，被照顧者在家中沒人照顧，甚至飲食不繼，希望能第一時間提供協助。現時有了數據互通後已掌握得很清楚，我理解在過去一段時間有數千個這樣的互通個案，實則上有很多照顧者在入院前已安排好，但我記得有三宗受助個案，若然不是有數據互通，可能會很麻煩，因為被照顧者已完全失能，我們亦成功提供協助。

至於其他類別，他們未必是照顧者或者被照顧者，你提到的其他類別我們希望想辦法盡可能找到他們。如果他是屬於我們擔心的隱蔽類別，通過大數據的互換，可以通過關愛隊去探望，看看他們有沒有社福需要。這個安排現時已在公共屋邨進行中，我們已經有香港房屋委員會的住戶資料，如果他是年紀大，即使沒有拿綜援或長者生活津貼，是獨老或雙老住戶，我們已陸續請關愛隊作探望。若發現有社福需要會作轉介，若認為他們有需要安裝平安鐘但經濟環境不好，我們會提供資助，現時正陸續推展這項工作，先由小範圍開始，做得好再逐步擴大，譬如除了公共屋邨外，下一步就擴展到香港房屋協會的屋邨，還有俗稱的「三無大廈」，較舊的唐樓也有不少老人家居住，我們認為應該集中做這些工作，一步一步地做。或者我請署長講解一下。

社會福利署署長：多謝你剛才的問題。對於剛才你提及不幸離世的同事所照顧的宏福苑居民，大家可以放心，我們已跟這戶居民聯絡，並已安排一位新的社工去照顧他們。多謝。

記者：會否覺得這次事件響起了一個警號，就是「一戶一社工」的前線員工壓力已超出負荷，之後會不會做些甚麼去減輕前線員工的壓力呢？

勞工及福利局局長：剛剛我也說了，社工的工作繁重。發生宏福苑大火後，大家都一心一意，希望能盡力幫助這1 982戶居民。同事盡自己力量去做工夫，社署署長及管理層亦提供了很多行政的支援，幫助同事去做好工作。希望大家理解，我們推行「一戶一社工」是因為看到宏福苑大火可說是史無前例的，而受影響的1 982戶居民的需要是多元化的，如果有特定的社工幫助他們，可以令他們的復原和得到支援方面做得更好。但社工不是單打獨鬥的，我們有配對的公務員義工。除此之外，如果有特別的需要，我們和其他社福界朋友都會合作，譬如說如果住戶有很多情緒支援的需要，我們都找了一些擅長這類支援的社工，他們未必是社署的社工，可能是來自社福界非政府機構的，我們都會合作的。我覺得對我們的社工而言，最重要的是大家的體諒、認同，心裏默默支持他們，他們已經覺得很溫暖了，會努力去提供服務。謝謝。"
"Administrator of Tai Po Wang Fuk Court - Hop On - facilitates disbursement of ""Operation Building Bright 2.0"" subsidies to eligible owners",2026-02-03 19:10,2026-02-03 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300665.htm,"​The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) today (February 3) announced arrangements for the Hop On Management Company Limited (Hop On), the appointed administrator for Wang Fuk Court (WFC) in Tai Po, to facilitate the disbursement of subsidies under the Urban Renewal Authority (URA)'s ""Operation Building Bright 2.0"" (OBB 2.0) to eligible owners.

On January 6 this year, the Lands Tribunal granted an order following an application by the Government under Section 31 of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) (BMO). The ruling formally dissolved the Management Committee (MC) of the WFC Owners' Corporation (OC) and appointed Hop On as the administrator of the estate. To discharge the functions of the MC under the BMO, Hop On has since initiated a series of tasks. These include updating bank account mandates, conducting a handover with the former management company, taking possession of OC records, and clarifying the legal liabilities and entitlements of the OC and owners. Hop On is also following up on performance bond matters and examining the OC's accounts. To ensure effective communication with residents, Hop On has established an online platform (www.WFCAdmin.com.hk). Meanwhile, a dedicated team from the Home Affairs Department has maintained close liaison with Hop On to provide the necessary support.

Through co-ordination between the Development Bureau and the HYAB, the URA has departed from its standard practice of disbursing subsidies to an OC's account and releasing only 85 per cent of the funds before confirming the discharge of relevant Statutory Orders. Under this exceptional arrangement, 100 per cent of the OBB 2.0 subsidy will be issued directly by cheque to approximately 1 700 eligible owner-occupiers and elderly owner-occupiers of WFC. The subsidy amounts are $40,000 and $50,000 respectively. This streamlined approach ensures that the funds reach residents more efficiently, with Hop On facilitating the distribution of these cheques.

Under the ""one social worker per household"" mechanism arranged by the Social Welfare Department, social workers will assist in reaching out to eligible owners. Upon obtaining the owners' consent, their contact information will be shared with Hop On for follow-up. Hop On will then contact the owners to explain the distribution logistics and schedule appointments for the time and location for cheque collection.

Hop On will establish multiple collection points across various districts this month. Eligible owners can collect their cheques at their prearranged time slots at designated locations in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories (including areas near transitional housing projects where more residents currently reside). Details of the collection schedule and locations will be uploaded to Hop On's website shortly for viewing. For enquiries regarding the subsidy scheme, owners may call the URA's OBB 2.0 hotline at 3188 1188."

​政務司司長出席「愛心食肆　賞你惠食」第四輪活動啓動禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2026-02-03 18:18,2026-02-03 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300654.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（二月三日）出席「愛心食肆賞你惠食」第四輪活動啓動禮的致辭：

尊敬的張宇人議員（行政會議成員張宇人）、梁進議員（立法會議員梁進）、各位愛心食肆代表、各位嘉賓、各位老友記：

大家好！今日我很高興出席「愛心食肆賞你惠食」第四輪活動的啓動禮，與大家一同見證這個這麼有意義的活動可以延續發展。

我記得在年多前與張宇人議員討論「愛心食肆賞你惠食」這個想法，當然他非常支持，我很感謝他，轉眼間到了今天，正如司儀所說，在一年多的時間已經即將開展第四輪，不單體現了政、商、民三方面攜手的力量，更進一步連繫了長者中心與社區中的長者，真正實踐了「關愛社區彼此連繫」的精神。

這個計劃，不單讓長者可以享受到經濟實惠的餐飲，更重要的是讓他們感受到社會真摯的關懷和溫暖，而其實最重要是希望鼓勵長者走進社區、參與活動，讓他們的生活多一份熱鬧與色彩，這是最重要的目的。

令人鼓舞的是，在上一輪活動中，非長者中心會員領取優惠券的比例，由約21%上升至約26%。這個不只是數字的增長，更代表越來越多以往未曾接觸過長者中心服務的長者，開始透過這個計劃認識社區、建立聯繫——這正正是我們最希望見到的改變，亦是我們這個計劃最重要的目的，因為我們希望更多長者能夠出來社區，與朋友見面聊天，光顧一些好吃的食肆，令他們的生活更精彩。

「愛心食肆賞你惠食」自推出以來，也獲得飲食業界越來越熱烈的支持。參與的飲食集團數目由第一輪的五間，逐步增加到今次的八間，我很感謝這八間愛心食肆，在簽感謝狀的時候亦特別從心感謝它們，包括大快活集團、大家樂集團、太興飲食集團、美心集團、香港麥當勞、銀龍飲食集團、香港必勝客有限公司，以及我們的新成員——香港KFC。

同時，餐飲優惠券的數量，正如司儀所說，也持續增加，從第一輪五萬套、上一輪六萬套、至今次七萬套，我們希望讓更多有需要的長者受惠，真正感受到社會的溫暖與陪伴，當然我們希望不論參與食肆的數目、派發給長者的優惠券數量，以及優惠都能夠不斷增加。

今天現場也有來自八間長者中心的機構代表和老友記，與我們共同見證這項愛心計劃的啓航，讓這場啓動禮更有意義。

在新一輪活動，我們會繼續透過全港超過200間長者中心，將餐飲優惠券送到特別是獨居長者、雙老住戶及隱蔽長者手中，一方面我們希望傳遞社會的關懷，另一方面也與大家一同共度溫馨的新春佳節，特別是隱蔽的長者，我們非常關心他們，因為如果他們不接觸我們，有時我們都有一些困難去接觸他們。所以希望透過給他們一些優惠券，吸引他們出來，多多參與長者中心的活動，認識更多朋友，令他們生活更開心。

每位受惠長者將獲發一套共八張優惠劵，在今年二月二十日，即是年初四開始，至四月十九日期間，可以憑券以25元優惠價，享用八間飲食集團提供的指定午市或晚市餐飲。我相信25元相當優惠，希望老友記之間可以相約一起，除了打麻雀外，亦可以去吃一點東西。

在這裏，我要衷心感謝八間飲食集團的積極參與。你們的付出，不單讓這計劃能夠順利進行，更讓長者們感受到社區的溫暖；你們每一份支持，都在幫助我們共建一個更關懷、更和諧的社會。

同時，我也要特別感謝張宇人議員一直以來不遺餘力、全力推動，有時我比較忙的時候，他都會推動我推進計劃，為本地飲食集團搭建了這個支援長者的平台。這一次活動也得到梁進議員的參與和推動，以後他也會出很大力在背後支持，充分展現出大家齊心關愛長者的精神。

最後，農曆新年就快到來，我在這裏提前向大家拜個早年，祝願各飲食集團業務蒸蒸日上，大家身體健康，笑口常開，豐衣足食！多謝大家！"
School Sharing and Recognition Ceremony of Whole School Health Programme showcases success stories of Health Promoting Schools (with photos),2026-02-03 17:58,2026-02-03 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300298.htm,"  The Department of Health (DH) today (February 3) organised the second School Sharing and Recognition Ceremony of Whole School Health Programme (WSHP) to recognise 14 ""Advanced Schools"" for implementing health promotion measures. School representatives shared their experiences in implementing school-based health promotion initiatives for other schools to learn from. Currently, nearly 900 primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong participate in the WSHP. The DH expressed gratitude for the enthusiastic support from schools and encouraged those not yet participating to join as soon as possible, working together to progressively foster the school campus into a Health Promoting School (HPS) that is beneficial for living, learning and working.

At the recognition ceremony, the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""Evidence-based international research indicates that implementing the HPS framework, as advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO), can positively impact student health, such as effectively reducing the risk of smoking among students, reducing bullying cases, and improving the body mass index of students, as well as increasing their physical activity and intake of fruits and vegetables. Students with sound physical and mental health can thrive in their studies, daily lives and interpersonal relationships. They are better equipped to tackle various challenges in their academic and personal growth.

""I encourage schools to make reference to the individualised 'School Health Reportand Recommendations' compiled by the DH to proactively formulate health promotion strategies and measures. This will further promote the physical and mental health of students on campuses.""

The DH launched the HPS Programme as a pilot project in 30 primary and secondary schools between the 2019/20 and 2022/23 school years. Starting from the 2023/24 school year, the DH has regularised the HPS Programme and renamed it the Whole School Health Programme to further help schools in Hong Kong become HPS. Making reference to the HPS framework, the WSHP assists schools in systematically reviewing and formulating health promotion measures related to four major health themes (namely physical activity, healthy eating, mental health and social well-being) and six key factors (namely healthy school policies, school's physical environment, school's social environment, community links, action competencies for healthy living, and school health care and promotion services).

The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, noted in his address that the WSHP has been well received over the past two years, with the participation rate steadily increasing, and the progress is encouraging. As of today, 889 schools in Hong Kong have participated in the WSHP (including 408 primary schools, 426 secondary schools and 55 special schools). This accounts for more than 75 per cent of primary and secondary schools. The DH encourages all primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong to actively participate in the WSHP, enabling Hong Kong to ultimately achieve the WHO's vision of ""making every school a health promoting school"".

The DH distributed the ""School Health Reports and Recommendations"" to all participating schools in August 2025 and arranged for dedicated teams to provide in-depth explanations of the health reports. The vast majority of schools found the reports comprehensive and clear. They reflected student health issues and assisted schools in reviewing their school-based circumstances and formulating health promotion measures. Thus, schools can progressively become HPS, thereby enhancing the physical and mental health of their students.

  During the sharing and recognition ceremony today, representatives of three ""Advanced Schools"" (namely Lam Tai Fai College, Xianggang Putonghua Yanxishe Primary School of Science and Creativity, and Sharon Lutheran School) shared their experiences in implementing school-based health promotion. They also briefed their efforts and achievements in actively implementing health promotion measures since participating in the HPS Programme from the 2019/20 school year.

  Under the WSHP, participating schools are progressively classified as ""Pledged Schools"", ""Actions Schools"" and ""Advanced Schools"" depending on the extent of implementation of the HPS framework. Based on the checklists submitted by the participating schools in the 2024/25 school year, 14 ""Actions Schools"" have fully implemented the HPS framework, demonstrating comprehensive developments across all six key factors of HPS and have successfully upgraded to ""Advanced Schools"", bringing the total number of ""Advanced Schools"" to 25, including the existing 11 ""Advanced Schools"" (see Annex).

For more information on the list of participating schools and the WSHP, members of the public may visit the DH'sdesignated webpage.

The DH also calls upon schools that have not yet participated in the WSHP to enrol in the programme by contacting the DH's Health Promoting School Division at 3163 4574.

In addition, the Student Health Service of the DH provides free annual health assessment service for primary and secondary students, including growth monitoring, physical examinations, screenings for vision, hearing and scoliosis, etc. If health or behavioural problems are identified, healthcare professionals will provide health counselling and relevant health information and refer the students to appropriate agencies for further assessment and treatment.

Enrolment for the annual health assessment service of the 2025/26 school year is now open. Students who have not yet enrolled may submit their applications online through GovHK, or complete the application and consent forms, and submit them with the required documents to respective Student Health Service Centres by email (dh_stdhs_enrolment_exercise@dh.gov.hk), post or fax. Please refer to the Student Health Servicewebsite for details and forms."
「全校園健康計劃」學校分享會暨嘉許禮以成功範例說好「健康促進學校」故事（附圖）,2026-02-03 17:58,2026-02-03 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300303.htm,"衞生署今日（二月三日）舉辦第二屆「全校園健康計劃」（計劃）學校分享會暨嘉許禮，表彰14所落實健康促進措施的「卓越學校」，並邀請學校代表分享推行校本健康促進工作的經驗，供其他學校參考借鏡。目前，全港已有近900所中小學參與計劃。衞生署感謝學校踴躍支持計劃，並鼓勵尚未參加的學校盡快加入，攜手令校園逐步成為一個有益於生活、學習及工作的「健康促進學校」。

醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授在嘉許禮上致辭時說：「國際實證研究顯示，學校實施世界衞生組織（世衞）倡議的《健康促進學校框架》能夠為學生健康帶來正面影響，例如有效降低學童的吸煙風險、減少欺凌個案、有助改善學生的體重指數，以及增加他們的體能活動和蔬果攝取量。擁有健康身心的學生，才能在學業、生活及人際關係中茁壯成長，更好地應對學習和成長路上的各種挑戰。」

「我鼓勵學校參考衞生署為其『度身訂造』的『一校一健康報告』，積極制定健康促進策略和措施，進一步在校園推動促進學生身心健康的工作。」

在二○一九／二○至二○二二／二三學年期間，衞生署以先導計劃形式於30所中小學試行「健康促進學校計劃」。自二○二三／二四學年起，衞生署將「健康促進學校計劃」恆常化，並定名為「全校園健康計劃」，進一步協助全港學校成為「健康促進學校」。計劃參考《健康促進學校框架》，協助學校有系統地檢視及制定有關四大健康主題（即體能活動、健康飲食、精神健康和社交健康）和六大發展領域（即健康學校政策、學校環境、校風與人際關係、家校與社區聯繫、健康生活技能與實踐及學校保健與健康促進服務）的健康促進措施。

衞生署署長林文健醫生致辭時表示，計劃在過去兩年得到全港學校踴躍支持，參與率不斷提升，進展令人鼓舞。截至今日，全港已有889所學校參加了計劃（包括408所小學、426所中學和55所特殊學校），涵蓋超過七成半的中小學。衞生署鼓勵全港中小學積極參與計劃，讓香港最終可達至世衞「讓每一所學校都成為健康促進學校」的願景。

衞生署已於二○二五年八月向所有參與計劃的學校發放《學校健康報告與建議》，並安排專責團隊向學校深入講解報告的內容。絕大部分學校認為報告內容詳盡清晰，能反映學生健康問題，幫助學校檢視校本情況及制定健康促進措施，從而逐步成為「健康促進學校」，進而提升其學生的身心健康。

在今日舉行的分享會暨嘉許禮上，三所「卓越學校」（包括林大輝中學、香港普通話研習社科技創意小學及路德會沙崙學校）的代表分享了推行校本健康推廣工作的經驗，並介紹了自二○一九／二○學年參與「健康促進學校計劃」以來在校園內積極推動健康促進工作的實踐和成果。

在計劃下，衞生署根據參與學校落實《健康促進學校框架》的程度，將其分為「承諾學校」、「行動學校」和「卓越學校」三個遞進式級別。根據二○二四／二五學年由參與學校遞交的檢視表，有14所「行動學校」已全面落實《健康促進學校框架》，在六個「健康促進學校」發展領域展現全面的發展，成功晉升為「卓越學校」，連同現有的11所「卓越學校」，目前合共有25所學校成為「卓越學校」（見附件）。

市民如欲了解參與計劃的學校名單和更多相關資料，可瀏覽衞生署專題網頁。

衞生署亦呼籲尚未參加計劃的學校致電3163 4574聯絡衞生署健康促進學校科報名參與。

此外，衞生署學生健康服務為中小學生提供免費周年健康檢查服務，包括生長監測、體格檢查、視力、聽力及脊柱側彎篩查等，如發現學生出現健康或行為問題，醫護人員會為其提供健康輔導及相關健康資訊，並轉介他們到合適的機構作進一步評估和治理。

二○二五／二六學年的周年健康檢查服務現已接受報名，尚未登記的學生可以透過政府一站通提交網上申請，亦可填妥參加表格及同意書，連同所需文件透過電郵（dh_stdhs_enrolment_exercise@dh.gov.hk）、郵寄或傳真至所屬學生健康服務中心。有關詳情及表格，請瀏覽學生健康服務網頁。"

Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-03 17:30,2026-02-03 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300581.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月三日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

林珍會長（原東江縱隊港九獨立大隊老游擊戰士聯誼會會長）、羅競輝老戰士（原東江縱隊港九獨立大隊老游擊戰士聯誼會副會長）、謝祥興老戰士（原東江縱隊港九獨立大隊老游擊戰士聯誼會理事）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。很高興今日可以出席東縱港九獨立大隊教育基金會首屆理事會就職典禮。

回首日本侵華戰爭期間，日軍從中國東北開始入侵，一九四一年十二月更展開對香港的侵略，最終令香港經歷三年零八個月的黑暗歲月。自從日軍進侵華南，中國共產黨領導華南抗日游擊隊，創建東江縱隊港九獨立大隊，組織波瀾壯闊的粵港秘密大營救，積極開展敵後抗日游擊戰爭，在華南抗戰當中發揮着中流砥柱的關鍵作用。去年是抗戰勝利80周年，我們亦隆重慶祝、紀念抗戰勝利，以至是這段我們不可忘記的抗戰歷史。藉今日的機會，我再次向各位抗日英雄、老戰士致以崇高的敬意。

同時，我要感謝原東江縱隊港九獨立大隊老游擊戰士聯誼會一直致力傳承歷史，弘揚愛國精神，一直支持康樂及文化事務署的展覽、歷史研究及教育活動等。我們去年與老戰士有很多見面機會，他們與公眾親身對談，談談當年的歷史，亦無私捐贈或借出抗戰文物，以至是徽章、紀念品等，增加了公眾對抗戰歷史的認識。若大家想更加了解這段歷史，我向各位推薦現在仍然在香港抗戰及海防博物館舉行的「風雨同舟共建和平——粵港人民抗戰勝利八十周年展」，這個展覽的展期至今年七月八日。

馬年將至，我祝願國家國泰民安，各位老戰士龍馬精神，祝願珍姐早沾勿藥、身體健康，大家福氣滿滿，基金會會務蒸蒸日上，首屆理事會工作順利。多謝大家。"

Provisional statistics of retail sales for December 2025 and Whole Year of 2025,2026-02-03 16:30,2026-02-03 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300456.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released the latest figures on retail sales today (February 3).

  The value of total retail sales in December 2025, provisionally estimated at $35.0 billion, increased by 6.6% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of the value of total retail sales in November 2025 increased by 6.5% compared with a year earlier.

  Of the total retail sales value in December 2025, online sales accounted for 8.8%. The value of online retail sales in that month, provisionally estimated at $3.1 billion, increased by 30.9% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of online retail sales in November 2025 increased by 28.4% compared with a year earlier.

  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in December 2025 increased by 5.1% compared with a year earlier. The revised estimate of the volume of total retail sales in November 2025 increased by 4.4% compared with a year earlier.

  Analysed by broad type of retail outlet in descending order of the provisional estimate of the value of sales and comparing December 2025 with December 2024, the value of sales of jewellery, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts increased by 14.3%. This was followed by sales of other consumer goods not elsewhere classified (+7.5% in value); electrical goods and other consumer durable goods not elsewhere classified (+58.9%); commodities in supermarkets (+0.3%); food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco (+0.5%); medicines and cosmetics (+0.6%); motor vehicles and parts (+8.9%); books, newspapers, stationery and gifts (+6.7%); and optical shops (+5.2%).

  On the other hand, the value of sales of wearing apparel decreased by 10.3% in December 2025 over a year earlier. This was followed by sales of commodities in department stores (-4.6% in value); fuels (-12.8%); footwear, allied products and other clothing accessories (-10.0%); Chinese drugs and herbs (-2.1%); and furniture and fixtures (-7.9%).

  Based on the seasonally adjusted series, the provisional estimate of the value of total retail sales increased by 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the preceding quarter, while the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales decreased by 0.4%.

  For 2025 as a whole, the value of total retail sales was provisionally estimated at $380.5 billion, increased by 1.0% in value and remained at a similar level in volume compared with 2024. The value of online retail sales was provisionally estimated at $35.7 billion, increased by 12.8% over 2024.

  Analysed by broad type of retail outlet in descending order of the provisional estimate of the value of sales and comparing the whole year of 2025 with the whole year of 2024, the value of sales of other consumer goods not elsewhere classified increased by 6.2%. This was followed by sales of jewellery, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts (+1.9% in value); electrical goods and other consumer durable goods not elsewhere classified (+14.3%); food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco (+1.6%); medicines and cosmetics (+4.2%); and optical shops (+0.2%).

  On the other hand, the value of sales of commodities in supermarkets decreased by 0.6% in 2025 compared with 2024. This was followed by sales of wearing apparel (-3.4% in value); commodities in department stores (-0.1%); motor vehicles and parts (-24.9%); fuels (-9.7%); books, newspapers, stationery and gifts (decrease of less than 0.05%); footwear, allied products and other clothing accessories (-6.5%); furniture and fixtures (-13.9%); and Chinese drugs and herbs (-1.4%).

Commentary

  A government spokesman said that the value of retail sales continued to recover solidly in December, rising further by 6.6% over a year earlier. For 2025 as a whole, total retail sales value resumed modest growth.

  Looking ahead, improving local consumption sentiment underpinned by robust economic growth momentum, together with continued vibrant growth in inbound visitors, will continue to be favourable to retail businesses.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the revised figures on value index and value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for November 2025 as well as the provisional figures for December 2025. The provisional figures on the value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet as well as the corresponding year-on-year changes for the whole year of 2025 are also shown.

  Table 2 presents the revised figures on value of online retail sales for November 2025 as well as the provisional figures for December 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the whole year of 2025 are also shown.

  Table 3 presents the revised figures on volume index of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for November 2025 as well as the provisional figures for December 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the whole year of 2025 are also shown.

  Table 4 shows the movements of the value and volume of total retail sales in terms of the year-on-year rate of change for a month compared with the same month in the preceding year based on the original series, and in terms of the rate of change for a three-month period compared with the preceding three-month period based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The classification of retail companies follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification (HSIC) Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  These retail sales statistics measure the sales receipts in respect of goods sold by local retail companies and are primarily intended for gauging the short-term business performance of the local retail sector. Data on retail sales are collected from local retail companies through the Monthly Survey of Retail Sales (MRS). Local retail companies with and without physical shops are covered in MRS and their sales, both through conventional shops and online channels, are included in the retail sales statistics.

  The retail sales statistics cover consumer spending on goods but not on services (such as those on housing, catering, medical care and health services, transport and communication, financial services, education and entertainment) which account for over 50% of the overall consumer spending. Moreover, they include spending on goods in Hong Kong by visitors but exclude spending outside Hong Kong by Hong Kong residents. Hence they should not be regarded as indicators for measuring overall consumer spending.

  Users interested in the trend of overall consumer spending should refer to the data series of private consumption expenditure (PCE), which is a major component of the Gross Domestic Product published at quarterly intervals. Compiled from a wide range of data sources, PCE covers consumer spending on both goods (including goods purchased from all channels) and services by Hong Kong residents whether locally or abroad. Please refer to the C&SD publication ""Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Component"" for more details.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey of Retail Sales"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080003&scode=530).

  Analysed by month, it was provisionally estimated that the value of total receipts of the restaurants sector increased by 3.9%, decreased by 0.6% and decreased by 0.5% respectively in October, November and December 2025, compared with the corresponding months in 2024.

  After discounting the effect of price changes, it was provisionally estimated that the volume of total restaurant receipts increased by 2.6%, decreased by 1.8% and decreased by 1.5% respectively in October, November and December 2025, compared with the corresponding months in 2024.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that the value of total restaurant receipts resumed an increase of 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. For 2025 as a whole, the value of total restaurant receipts rose back slightly.

  Looking ahead, restaurant businesses should continue to be underpinned by improving local consumption sentiment, ongoing increase in employment earnings and sustained visible growth in inbound visitors.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the revised figures of restaurant receipts by type of restaurant and total purchases by the restaurants sector for the third quarter of 2025 as well as the provisional figures for the fourth quarter of 2025.

  Table 2 and Table 3 present the revised value and volume indices respectively of restaurant receipts by type of restaurant for the third quarter of 2025 and the provisional indices for the fourth quarter of 2025.

  Table 4 presents the year-on-year rate of change in total restaurant receipts in value and volume terms based on the original quarterly series, as well as the quarter-to-quarter rate of change based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The revised figures on restaurant receipts and purchases for the fourth quarter of 2025 (with breakdown by month) will be released through the website of C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode540.html) and relevant publications of the Department from March 20, 2026.

  The classification of restaurants follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification (HSIC) Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Quarterly Survey of Restaurant Receipts and Purchases"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080002&scode=540).

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（二月三日）公布金融科技推廣藍圖，提出推動負責任創新及進階應用金融科技。

在「金融科技2030」（註一）下，這戰略執行藍圖將透過推動高效能運算基礎設施的應用，拓展人工智能和分布式分類帳技術（DLT）的進階方案。藍圖以數據卓越和網絡韌性為基礎，旨在強化銀行業在運用先進科技時的風險管理能力。

藍圖提出一套以生態協作、技術演變以及人才培育為執行核心的框架。未來數月，金管局將推出四個旗艦項目，包括：


量子準備度指數：鑑於量子計算對依賴安全加密技術的金融業具有深遠影響，金管局將推出量子準備度指數，以評估銀行業在後量子密碼學（PQC）領域的準備情況。該指數不僅提供全面的現狀分析，亦將作為未來數年可量化的目標，協助金管局在銀行業過渡至PQC的過程中提供實務支援。




全新風險數據策略：為充分發揮人工智能和DLT在尖端應用的潛力，金管局將推行全新風險數據策略，以強化銀行業的數據管理能力。透過更完善的數據管治框架與更先進的數據基礎設施，銀行將可以更有效運用複雜的結構化及非結構化數據（註二）進行進階分析，應對不斷變化的風險環境。有關能力亦將支持金管局擴展「細緻數據匯報」計劃，進一步強化風險管理和銀行監管工作的靈活性。




金融科技網絡安全基準：金管局將與業界合作，為金融科技公司制定一套全新而標準化、業界主導的金融科技網絡安全基準，重點聚焦於人工智能和DLT等新興技術的應用。此基準旨在為金融科技公司與銀行合作時提供清晰的安全指引，從而強化整個金融科技生態圈的信任基礎與風險韌性，同時提升銀行在引入金融科技合作夥伴時的盡職審查效率。




資歷發展支援：金管局將與業界合作，提供實務指引，以提升銀行中一般金融科技使用者的技能，並輔助現有的資歷發展工作。措施將聚焦於提升「人機互動」能力，讓從業員能更清楚了解將人工智能與 DLT融入新一代金融產品與服務時所需的技能。


藍圖亦參考《金融科技成熟度調查》（註三）結果，提出一系列措施以應對挑戰金融科技進一步發展的主要因素。這些措施包括FiNETech系列、負責任創新比賽、優化Fintech Connect配對平台，以及實務工作坊。

金管局副總裁阮國恒表示：「金融業的未來將由那些能夠駕馭先進技術的推動者定義，他們不僅優化現有流程，更能重塑未來的可能性。透過鼓勵負責任創新、加強跨境協作及持續投資人才發展，藍圖提供實務指引，協助構建具韌性及前瞻性的生態圈──一個能平衡風險和機遇急速演變的未來金融系統。」

HKMA unveils Fintech Promotion Blueprint: From adoption to advancement,2026-02-03 15:47,2026-02-03 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300415.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (February 3) a Fintech Promotion Blueprint to foster responsible innovation and fintech advancement.

  Under ""Fintech 2030"" (Note 1), this tactical Blueprint focuses on more sophisticated applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technologies (DLT), enabled by the infrastructural support of High-Performance Computing. With Data Excellence and Cyber Resilience being the foundational pillars, the Blueprint aims to further strengthen the banking sector's ability to better manage risks associated with advanced technologies.

The Blueprint sets out a cohesive framework of initiatives structured around tactical dimensions of Ecosystem Collaboration, Technological Advancement, as well as Talent and Outreach. In the coming months, the HKMA will launch four flagship projects, including:


Quantum Preparedness Index: Recognising Quantum Computing's far-reaching implications for the financial industry which relies on secure encryption technologies, the HKMA will develop a Quantum Preparedness Index to assess the readiness of the banking sector for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The Index will not only offer a comprehensive current-state analysis, but also serve as a measurable target for the next few years and guide the HKMA's efforts to provide practical support throughout the PQC transition journey.




New Risk Data Strategy: To unlock the full potential of advanced AIand DLT applications, the HKMA will implement a New Risk Data Strategy designed to enhance the data management capabilities of banks.With more robust data governance frameworks and sophisticated data infrastructure, banks will be able to more effectively leverage complex structured and unstructured data (Note 2)for advanced analytics, navigating the dynamic risk landscape.These capabilities will also support the expansion of the HKMA's Granular Data Reporting initiative, strengthening the agility of risk management and banking supervision.




Fintech Cybersecurity Baseline: The HKMA will work with industry experts to establish a new, standardised, industry-led Fintech Cybersecurity Baseline for fintech solution providers, focusing on specific novel applications of AIand DLT. The baseline seeks to provide clear cybersecurity guidance for fintech solution providers partnering with banks, thereby strengthening trust and resilience throughout the ecosystem, and improving the efficiency of the due diligence process conducted by financial institutions when onboarding fintech partners.




Competency development support: The HKMA will work with the industry to provide practical guidance to enhance the skills of general fintech users, complementing existing competency support efforts.With a focus on ""human-machine interaction"" capability, the initiative aims to establish a clear view of the skills required for the advanced applications of AIand DLT in the next generation of financial products and services.


The Blueprint also introduces a series of activities to address the key challenges to further fintech advancements, as identified in the Tech Maturity Stock-take (Note 3). These initiatives include FiNETech events, responsible innovation competitions, a revamp of the Fintech Connect matching platform and practical workshops.

  Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA Mr Arthur Yuensaid, ""The future of finance will be defined by those who can harness sophisticated technology, not only to improve existing processes, but to reimagine what is possible. By embracing responsible innovation, strengthening cross-boundary collaboration, and investing in talent development, the Blueprint provides the tactical guidance we need to build a resilient and forward-looking Fintech ecosystem - one that balances the rapid evolution of both risk and opportunity.""

The full report of the Blueprint is available on theHKMA website.

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2026-02-03 15:45,2026-02-03 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300501.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on February 2 to noon today (February 3), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 127 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 201 307 samples of food imported from Japan (including 129 093 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 44 422 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

In all, 3.2 millimetres of rainfall were recorded during the month, only about 10 per cent of the normal of 33.2 millimetres for a January. The monthly mean relative humidity of 63 per cent was 11 per cent below the normal of 74 per cent, and the ninth lowest on record for January. The monthly total sunshine duration amounted to 216.1 hours, about 48 per cent above the normal of 145.8 hours. The month was also warmer than usual, with a mean temperature of 17.5 degrees, 1.0 degree above the normal of 16.5 degrees. The monthly mean maximum temperature of 20.3 degrees was 1.6 degrees above the normal of 18.7 degrees and one of the eighth highest on record.

Under the influence of the dry northeast monsoon, the weather in Hong Kong was fine during the first five days of the month, with cold mornings on January 2 and 3. With the arrival of an intense replenishment of the winter monsoon on the night of January 5, local winds strengthened from the north overnight. The local weather remained fine with cold mornings over most parts of the territory from January 6 to 10. The temperatures at the Observatory fell to a minimum of 10.9 degrees on the morning of January 7, the lowest of the month. It was also very dry during the day from January 7 to 11. The relative humidity recorded at the Observatory once fell to 17 per cent on the afternoon of January 8, the lowest on record in January since the establishment of the automatic weather station at the Observatory's Headquarters in 1984. Under clear skies and relatively weak winds, radiation cooling was significant over inland areas. There were frost reports over parts of the northeastern New Territories on the mornings from January 8 to 10.

With the setting in of a fresh to strong easterly airstream on January 12, the local weather was mainly cloudy in the morning but turned fine in the afternoon. With the moderation of the easterly airstream the next day, winds became weak and there was haze locally. Under the influence of the dry northeast monsoon, apart from one or two showers on the morning of January 15 and some haze that night, the local weather remained fine from January 14 to 19. It was also very dry during the day on January 16 and 17. With plenty of sunshine, the temperatures at the Observatory rose to a maximum of 24.8 degrees on the afternoon of January 17, the highest of the month.

Under the influence of a replenished northeast monsoon, and with a broad band of clouds covering the coast of Guangdong, the local weather turned mainly cloudy and dry from January 20 to 23 with cold mornings over most parts of the territory from January 21 to 23. With the thinning out of the band of clouds, it was dry with sunny periods during the day from January 24 to 26. With the moderation of the northeast monsoon, winds subsided later on January 26. There was some haze during the day of the next day, with the visibility in the harbour once falling below 5 000 metres. The temperatures at the Observatory rose to the month's high-level mark of 24.8 degrees again on January 27. Under the influence of weak monsoon replenishments, it was slightly cooler on the mornings of January 28 and 29. Under the influence of an easterly airstream and with a broad band of clouds covering the coast of Guangdong, the local weather was cloudy with one or two rain patches on January 29 and 30. A northeast monsoon replenishment affected southern China on the last day of the month, and the local weather became cooler gradually with a few rain patches and relatively low visibility.

One tropical cyclone occurred over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific during January 2026.

"DH organises Medical Products Regulation Symposium to familiarise trade with timetable and roadmap for Hong Kong's move towards ""primary evaluation"" of medical products (with photos)",2026-02-03 14:00,2026-02-03 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/03/P2026020300247.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) and the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) today (February 3) co-organised the Medical Products Regulation (MPR) Symposium to brief representatives from local and mainland regulatory authorities, academia, research institutions and the trade on the timetable and roadmap towards the adoption of ""primary evaluation"" of medical products in Hong Kong.

The Symposium was held under the theme of ""the Future of Medical Products Regulation"". The DH highlighted the latest developments in the regulation of medical products in Hong Kong, with a view to promoting research, development and clinical trials, thereby enabling more patients to have earlier access to advanced medical treatments and diagnostics. Representatives from the HKSTP shared the measures to promote medical products innovation, while representatives from the trade introduced the latest developments in the clinical research ecosystem.

Delivering his opening remarks, the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, said, ""The year 2026 will mark a significant milestone for the development of innovative drugs and medical device regulations in Hong Kong, China. 'The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address' announced that the Government will set up the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) in 2026, and implement the 'primary evaluation' mechanism for new drug registration in phases starting from that year, enabling Hong Kong to independently assess and approve the safety and efficacy of medical products based on clinical data, with a view to developing Hong Kong into an internationally recognised authority on medical products regulation. The establishment of the 'primary evaluation' mechanism will help expedite the development of innovative medical products, thereby achieving the goal of making good drugs and medical devices available for use in Hong Kong.""

Regarding the phased implementation of ""primary evaluation"", the initial phases will cover applications for the registration of products containing registered chemical entities with extended applications (e.g. new indications, new strengths, new posology, new dosage forms, etc). This will progressively establish a robust approval system, providing strong momentum for the development and market expansion of the healthcare industry in Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland, and beyond.

""The Government will also submit a legislative proposal on regulating medical devices this year. We encourage the trade to submit applications to list their medical devices under the Medical Device Administrative Control System early, so as to be better prepared for the transition to the future statutory framework,"" Dr Lam said.

""The DH has been closely monitoring technological developments in innovative medical devices and has issued guidance in a timely manner, such as technical reference documents for the listing of artificial intelligence medical devices, to assist the trade in understanding the relevant requirements. We firmly believe that promoting collaboration among industry, academia and research institutions is of vital importance. To this end, we have stepped up our efforts to communicate and engage with stakeholders, which is also the purpose of this Symposium. We hope that all sectors will work together to lay a solid foundation for Hong Kong's development as an international medical innovation hub, while contributing to our country's efforts to become one of the forerunners in health and medical innovation,"" Dr Lam added.

This year, with strong support from the National Medical Products Administration, the DH will host the annual meeting of the Global Harmonization Working Party (GHWP). Representatives from global medical device regulatory authorities and industry leaders will gather in Hong Kong, laying the initial foundation for the future role of the CMPR in connecting and establishing a global medical products regulatory system, and even becoming a forerunner in this field.

Additionally, the DH began offering one-on-one pre-new drug application meetings last December for potential applicants for new drugs registration through the ""1+"" mechanism. Dr Lam urged the pharmaceutical industry to actively apply, working together to achieve the goals of early consultation to enhance quality and efficiency throughout the process so that registration approval can be expedited in Hong Kong, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub. This service aims to further optimise the new drug registration approval process, and no fees will be charged for this service at this stage.

The Symposium was attended by over 700 participants today. The DH will continue to work closely with different stakeholders to refine regulatory processes and strengthen regional and international collaboration, so as to fully leverage Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder""."
