Transport Department issues first official Taxi Fleet Licence (with photos),2025-07-14 12:00,2025-07-14 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/14/P2025071400301.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (July 14) that an official Taxi Fleet Licence has been issued to SynCab Taxi (mixed fleet), operated by SynCab Service Limited, in accordance with regulation 12E(1) of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations (Cap. 374D) for a period of five years. The fleet officially commenced services today.

 The TD has approved the taxi livery design and markings of the fleet. For easy identification by passengers, all fleet taxis are required to display fleet taxi plates (see Annex) at the front and rear of the taxi bodies, and a fleet taxi certificate on the windscreens of the taxis.

 All fleets provide online hailing services. Fleet taxis may customise fares for pre-arranged journeys, charging a booking fee on top of the metered fare or charging a lump sum fare before the journey starts. Both must be agreed with the hirer in advance. The fares of fleet taxis may vary for pre-arranged journeys depending on the circumstances at the time of booking and the types of taxis requested by the passenger. For example, higher fares may be charged during peak hours or when the passenger requests a premium taxi. For street-hailing trips, fleet taxis shall charge according to the same fare schedule as general taxis.

 The TD has set up a taxi fleet thematic website. It will also introduce information of the taxi fleet service to the public and tourists through various online and offline channels, including the TD's HKeMobility mobile application, and the collaboration with the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal operator and Hong Kong Talent Engage.

 In addition, the TD has set up about 80 designated fleet taxi stopping places across 13 locations, such as the airport, certain boundary control points, the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, some Airport Express stations, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal and the Hong Kong Disneyland. Information plates will be installed at these locations. The TD will also put up signage and display panels at some of these locations, and display online hailing QR codes via leaflets and posters for the public and tourists to make their bookings.

 The TD will monitor the fleet's operations and continue to actively promote the remaining fleets to commence operations as soon as possible."

The HKMA advises the public to carefully verify documents purported to be issued by the HKMA, or institutions purported to be regulated by the HKMA. If in doubt, they may refer to the Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices, the Register of Stored Value Facility Licensees, and the List of Approved Money Brokers available on the HKMA website, or contact the HKMA (enquiry hotline: 2878 8222).

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-14 10:50,2025-07-14 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/14/P2025071400312.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference.

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.

葉華雄會長（香港泉州社團聯會會長）、黃景彬監事長（香港泉州社團聯會監事長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。我很高興通過視頻參與今天的盛會，與大家一同慶祝香港回歸祖國二十八周年，並祝賀香港泉州社團聯會成立三十六周年和第十七屆理監事就職。

習近平主席去年到福建考察時提出，要創新發展「晉江經驗」，充分激發全社會的投資創業活力。泉州正朝着這個方向邁進，推動高新技術產業與傳統產業協調發展，成效顯著。

泉州是福建省三個中心城市之一，積極參與「一帶一路」倡議，民營經濟發展蓬勃，已成為福建省以至全國經濟的重要引擎。香港作為粵港澳大灣區的中心城市之一，是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，一直是福建省最大境外投資來源地。我相信，香港和泉州未來在經貿、文化和旅遊等方面會保持廣闊的合作空間。

香港和福建同處泛珠三角區域，兩地關係密切，文化淵源深厚。從十九世紀到現在，大批泉州鄉親移居香港。他們秉持福建人勇於打拼的精神，在各行各業盡展所長，為香港繁榮穩定貢獻力量。

香港泉州社團聯會自一九八九年成立以來，一直廣泛團結和凝聚鄉親，促進泉州和香港的經貿合作和文化交流。聯會積極協辦招商引資推介會，鼓勵在港鄉親回鄉投資興業，又參與不同社會事務和慈善活動，建設香港。我肯定聯會多年來的工作和貢獻。

今年是香港回歸祖國二十八周年。多年以來，香港在國家的全力支持下，不但在面對挑戰的時候轉危為機，更一直開發不同新機遇，如今走上了由治及興的新征程。現在，香港正處於經濟轉型期，是機遇和挑戰並存的重要時期，而機遇遠大於挑戰。特區政府會把握好國家機遇，積極融入國家發展大局，深化國際交往合作，全力拼經濟、謀發展。我們會全力發揮香港作為國際金融、貿易和航運中心的優勢，通過提供國際化的營商環境和多元化的專業服務，服務來自泉州和不同內地城市的企業拓展海外市場，實現互利共贏。

我期望聯會在新一屆理監事帶領下，與特區政府攜手合作，同時繼續弘揚愛國、愛港、愛鄉的精神，為家鄉和香港的發展發揮力量，為中華民族偉大復興作出更大貢獻。

最後，我祝願泉州、香港兩地繁榮昌盛，香港泉州社團聯會竿頭日進，新一屆理監事工作順利。

謝謝大家。"
