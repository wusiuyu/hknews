本人自二○二○年四月獲中央任命為特區政府政制及內地事務局局長。多年以來一直盡心盡力做好工作，致力為特區和市民服務；但在高強度工作中，身體亦漸漸出現了情況。雖然作了不同檢查並按醫生指示服藥，但情況仍未有改善。經與家人及醫生商量後，認為目前最好的方法是放下工作，減少壓力並調理好身體。因此我在去年底完成立法會選舉任務後便思考並最終決定向行政長官作出請辭。在這裏，我再次感謝中央和行政長官多年來的信任、支持和指導，亦感謝社會各界的支持和配合。日後若有機會，我仍希望在不同崗位或範疇為社會作出貢獻。最後，再次感謝大家的關心！"

主席、各位議員：

大家好，很高興今日能夠參加新一屆公務員及資助機構員工事務委員會的會議。我與常任秘書長、公務員學院院長、幾位副秘書長和一般職系處長，將會為各位介紹本屆政府在公務員事務方面的政策措施及未來計劃。我亦期望稍後的日子，會有更多機會與各位議員就公務員事務多作溝通及互相交流意見，建立共識，和各議員在行政主導和「愛國者治港」原則下，共同發揮建設香港的力量和價值，為香港建立愛國愛港、專業高效、勇於擔當的公務員隊伍。

今天，我們為簡報會預備了一套投影片。我們會從議員及市民都十分關注的幾個重點層面，即公務員管理、優化公務員人力資源運用、鼓勵人才加入政府、強化公務員培訓、推動公務員義工服務，以及優化公務員服務條件，為各位作出簡介。

首先，我以公務員管理這項作開始。我們了解社會對公務員的期望日益提高，我們十分重視公務員管理的工作。公務員事務局已在二○二四年六月頒布更新版《公務員守則》（《守則》），闡明《憲法》和《基本法》共同構成香港特別行政區的憲制基礎及秩序、在這個基礎下公務員的憲制角色和責任，以及公務員須恪守的12項基本信念和操守準則，作為所有公務員在日常工作、決策和行為的重要指南。我們非常重視公務員的品行及操守。絕大部分公務員一向都秉持《守則》中的信念和操守行事、盡忠職守。對於少數違法違紀的公務員，政府絕不會姑息，必定嚴肅處理每宗個案。我們亦會透過持續培訓，讓公務員準確掌握《守則》對其行為和心態上的要求，盡忠竭誠服務社會。

接下來，我的團隊同事會繼續就各政策重點進行簡介。稍後，我們歡迎議員提問和給予意見。"

Speech by FS at Asian Financial Forum Global Business Summit (English only) (with photos/video),2026-01-27 11:51,2026-01-27 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/27/P2026012700244.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Asian Financial Forum Global Business Summit today (January 27):

Fred (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Professor Frederick Ma), Vice Mayor Wu Wei (Member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei), Vice Governor Tang (Vice-Governor of the People's Government of Shanxi Province, Mr Tang Zhiping), Vice Governor Wang (Vice-Governor of the People's Government of Hunan Province, Mr Wang Junshou), 張文武副董事長 (Vice Chairman and President of CITIC Group, Mr Zhang Wenwu), your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Welcome to this inaugural Global Business Summit. To government officials and business leaders joining us from around the world, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong.

  We are meeting at a pivotal moment, marked by a deep structural transformation in industrial development - driven by several powerful forces.

Global industries in transformation

  First, artificial intelligence (AI) and other frontier technologies are reshaping how products are designed, factories operate, supply chains are managed, and services are delivered. AI is not only an industry in its own right; its greatest value lies in its ability to scale across processes and supply chains, accelerating innovation in areas such as advanced manufacturing and biotechnology. It ultimately will become a defining competitive advantage.

  Second, the green transition. Around the world, most economies continue to move steadily towards carbon neutrality, with rising demand for decarbonised industrial processes and green products. The shift to renewable energy, electric vehicles and emerging solutions such as green hydrogen is creating new industrial chains and investment cycles, and better responds to consumers' aspirations for green products.

  Third, geopolitics and supply-chain reconfiguration. Geoeconomic fragmentation is reshaping economic relationships and driving businesses to diversify production networks, balancing efficiency with resilience. For businesses, the key question is far more than ""where is cheapest?"", but ""where is secure, scalable, sustainable and cost-competitive?""

China under spotlight

  Clearly, China is at the heart of these developments. It has the world's most comprehensive and complete industrial system. It is a global leader in technological innovation, such as AI, robotics and biotech. It is advancing rapidly in green transformation. In a changing geoeconomic landscape, Chinese companies are also diversifying their supply and industrial bases, and deepening participation in international industrial and supply-chain co-operation.

  It is noteworthy that in the Recommendations for the 15th Five-Year Plan, the country will continue to pursue high quality development as well as technological self-reliance. It has emphasised the deep integration of technological and industry innovation.

Hong Kong's catalytic role

  Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to turn to Hong Kong. Looking ahead, trade, finance and innovation and technology will be the three principal drivers of our economic growth.

  On innovation and technology, over the past few years, we have invested more than HK$200 billion to drive its development, and formulated a comprehensive strategy to expedite progress across the spectrum. From supporting R&D (research and development) and building the relevant infrastructure, to nurturing start-ups and attracting talent, we are strengthening Hong Kong's tech ecosystem from upstream to downstream.

  Our priority sectors are clear: artificial intelligence and data science, biotech, fintech, and new energy and new materials. These are areas where we have strong foundations and clear competitive advantages.

  A further essential piece in building a more vibrant tech ecosystem is technology enterprises. This is why this Government is determined to attract the world's leading frontier-technology enterprises to Hong Kong. Over the past three years, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises has attracted more than 100 strategic enterprises, which are expected to invest over HK$60 billion and create more than 22 000 jobs. Moreover, these companies will bring in partners across their value chains, further strengthening and broadening Hong Kong's innovation ecosystem.

  To better integrate I&T (innovation andtechnology) with industrial development, this Government has made it a priority to expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, a strategic development area comprising around one-third of Hong Kong's landmass.

  We welcome technology and industrial enterprises to establish a presence in the Northern Metropolis. Where justified, we are prepared to tailor incentive packages, which may include land grants, premium concessions, tax incentives and other facilitation measures. Everything is negotiable. Specific arrangements will be considered in light of factors such as the frontier technologies and investment to be brought in, the project's economic benefits, the jobs to be created, and the extent to which the projects will strengthen Hong Kong's innovation ecosystem.

  We are also providing for more flexible development models in the Northern Metropolis, including large-scale land disposals for high-impact projects.

  It helps that Hong Kong is an international financial centre, offering a full spectrum of funding options to support tech companies at different development stages to scale up. That includes a vibrant private equity and venture capital ecosystem. That, of course, also includes a deep and liquid stock market.

  The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has established the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, or HKIC. It provides patient capital and makes strategic investments in high-potential ventures, particularly in hard technology. HKIC is willing to co-invest in projects where justified.

  Taken together, we are leveraging finance to power tech and industry development. Our world-class financial services and international connectivity further enhance Hong Kong's overall value proposition.

Closing remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, the message I wish to leave with you today is this: Hong Kong is not just a platform that connects capital, market, projects, talent and opportunity. Hong Kong is willing to be a strategic partner to help you grow, scale up and go global.

  Thank you very much. I wish the Summit every success, and the best of health and business to you all."

  A department spokesman said that the adjustment on February 1, 2026, would reflect the movement of the LPG international price in January 2026, and the average movement of the latest Composite Consumer Price Index and Nominal Wage Index. The overall adjusted auto-LPG ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations would range from $3.32 to $4.26 per litre, amounting to an increase of $0.17 to $0.19 per litre.

  The spokesman said that the auto-LPG ceiling prices were adjusted according to a pricing formula specified in the contracts. The formula comprises two elements - the LPG international price and the LPG operating price. The LPG international price refers to the LPG international price of the preceding month. The LPG operating price is adjusted on February 1 and June 1 annually according to the average movement of the Composite Consumer Price Index and the Nominal Wage Index. The latest year-on-year rates of change of the Composite Consumer Price Index and the Nominal Wage Index are +1.4 per cent and +3.7 per cent respectively.

金管局及私隱專員公署加強合作打擊詐騙及保障個人資料（附圖）,2026-01-27 11:00,2026-01-27 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/27/P2026012600513.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

​香港金融管理局（金管局）及個人資料私隱專員公署（私隱專員公署）今日（一月二十七日）聯合公布一系列新措施，加強合作打擊詐騙，並加大力度保障個人資料免受濫用。

有見詐騙手法日趨複雜，金管局與私隱專員公署將深化合作，確保銀行的系統及管控措施能有效應對風險，並適時向銀行分享最佳做法。相關措施包括對部分銀行的反詐騙系統及管控措施進行風險為本的聯合審查，其中金管局將重點評估銀行就二○二四年十二月及二○二五年四月兩份通函中所載的反詐騙措施的落實成效，而私隱專員公署則會審視銀行為保障個人資料免受濫用及外洩而採取的資料保安措施及存取管控機制。

此外，金管局與私隱專員公署將攜手加強公眾推廣及教育，並與香港警務處（警務處）、香港銀行公會及銀行業界等主要持份者緊密合作，提升公眾防騙意識，提醒他們最新的詐騙手法及保障個人資料（包括銀行帳戶資料）的重要性。相關工作將涵蓋面向公眾及針對特定群體的宣傳活動。

鑑於詐騙手法層出不窮，市民在提供個人資料時，包括銀行帳戶資料及登入帳戶和密碼，必須保持警覺，防止相關資料被用作詐騙或洗黑錢。市民亦應留意由金管局、私隱專員公署及警務處發布的最新防騙資訊。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「打擊詐騙有助維護公眾對香港金融體系的信心，金管局一直重視相關工作。我們與私隱專員公署加強合作，是提升反詐騙生態圈更有效防範騙徒濫用本港銀行體系進行欺詐行為的重要里程碑。」

個人資料私隱專員鍾麗玲表示：「鑑於銀行每日處理大量個人資料，銀行業界必須採取嚴謹的資料保安及監控措施，以防止客戶個人資料遭到未經授權或意外的存取或濫用。私隱專員公署很高興與金管局合作，在金融業界推動防騙及保障個人資料私隱的文化。」

背景

詐騙活動日具規模、漸趨複雜。二○二五年首10個月，香港共錄得35 831宗騙案，損失金額為64億港元。為應對不斷演變的詐騙手法，金管局持續加強銀行業應對詐騙及洗錢活動的能力，並於去年四月推出多項措施，包括更廣泛使用「防騙視伏器」數據、修訂《銀行業條例》以促進銀行間訊息交換、與銀行分享反詐騙的良好做法、專題審查檢視銀行打擊詐騙措施的成效，以及加強「切勿借／賣戶口」的公眾宣傳及教育。為進一步提升反詐騙生態圈的成效，金管局與私隱專員公署深化合作打擊詐騙，並加大力度保障個人資料免受濫用。

詐騙及金融罪行往往涉及惡意使用個人資料，因此保障個人資料私隱一直是打擊詐騙工作中的重要一環。為應對騙徒不斷變化的手法，私隱專員公署持續加強公眾教育及提升公眾防騙意識。除了向各界人士舉辦防騙講座，公署推出以「咁大隻蛤乸隨街跳？」為題的全新防騙宣傳單張及海報，以提高公眾對防騙及保障個人資料的意識。相關資料已經派發至各區民政事務處、社區中心、長者中心、銀行及學校。自二○二二年起，私隱專員公署設立了「個人資料防騙熱線」（3423 6611），處理公眾就詐騙或懷疑詐騙個案的查詢。此外，私隱專員公署亦推出「防騙貼士」專題網頁，為市民提供一站式資訊平台。"

HKMA and PCPD strengthen collaboration to combat fraud and safeguard personal data (with photo),2026-01-27 11:00,2026-01-27 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/27/P2026012600522.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

​The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) jointly announced today (January 27) a series of new measures to enhance collaboration in combatting fraud and strengthening the protection against misuse of personal data.

In view of the increasing sophistication of fraud, the HKMA and the PCPD have strengthened their co-operation to ensure that banks' systems and safeguards against these risks are robust, and that best practices are shared with banks on a timely basis. These efforts will include joint risk-based examinations of selected banks' anti-fraud systems and controls, in which the HKMA will focus on assessing the effective implementation of anti-fraud measures set out in circulars issued in December 2024 and April 2025, whilst the PCPD will review the banks' data security measures and access controls that are designed to safeguard personal data against misuse and leakage.

Moreover, the HKMA and the PCPD will strengthen joint publicity and educational efforts, and work closely with other key stakeholders including the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), The Hong Kong Association of Banks and the industry, to raise public awareness of the latest scam tactics and the importance of protecting personal data, including bank account information. These efforts will include outreach activities targeting members of the public and specific segments of society.

Given the evolving nature of deception tactics, it is essential for the public to remain vigilant when providing personal data, including bank account information and login credentials, to prevent such data from being misused for deception or money laundering. Members of the public are also encouraged to stay informed about the latest fraud prevention information published by the HKMA, the PCPD and the HKPF.

  The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,said, ""Anti-fraud work has been a priority for the HKMA as it helps to uphold public confidence in the financial system of Hong Kong. The collaboration with the PCPD marks a significant milestone in enhancing the ecosystem approach in the fight against the abuse of our banking system for fraudulent purposes.""

  The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Ms Ada Chung,said, ""In light of the substantial volume of personal data handled by banks on a daily basis, it is imperative for the banking industry to adopt stringent data security and monitoring measures to prevent unauthorised or accidental access or misuse of customers' personal data. We are very pleased to collaborate with the HKMA in cultivating a culture of fraud prevention and personal data privacy protection across the financial sector.""

Background

Fraud continues to grow in scale and complexity. During the first 10 months of 2025, a total of 35 831 deception cases were reported in Hong Kong, resulting in total losses amounting to $6.4 billion. To keep pace with the evolving nature of fraud, the HKMA has continued to strengthen the banking industry's response to fraud and money laundering, with a number of measures introduced in April last year. These include expanded use of Scameter data, amendment of the Banking Ordinance to facilitate information sharing among banks, sharing of good anti-fraud practices with banks, thematic reviews on the effectiveness of banks' anti-fraud measures, and enhanced publicity and education efforts on ""Don’t Lend/Sell Your Account"". To further enhance the ecosystem approach, the HKMA is collaborating with the PCPD to combat fraud, and to strengthen the protection against misuse of personal data.

The protection of personal data privacy has always been one of the critical priorities in combatting fraud, as deception and financial crimes often involve malicious use of personal data. To address the evolving deceptive tactics employed by fraudsters, the PCPD continues to strengthen its efforts on public education and raising awareness against fraud. Apart from conducting anti-fraud talks for different stakeholders, the PCPD has published a new anti-fraud leaflet and poster with the theme ""Too Good to be True"" to enhance public awareness of fraud prevention and personal data protection. Both publications have been distributed to District Offices, community centres, elderly centres, banks and schools. Since 2022, the PCPD has set up the ""Personal Data Fraud Prevention Hotline"" (3423 6611) to handle public enquiries about fraud or suspected fraud cases from members of the public. The PCPD has also launched the webpage entitled ""Anti-Fraud Tips"", with a view to providing a one-stop information portal for members of the public."
民政及青年事務局局長在立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會政策簡報會的開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-27 10:50,2026-01-27 11:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/27/P2026012700208.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（一月二十七日）在立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會政策簡報會的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

我會先扼要談談一些民青局的工作重點，包括《行政長官2025年施政報告》有關民青局工作政策範疇的事項，聽取委員的意見和回應提問。

青年發展方面，政府十分重視青年發展。自《青年發展藍圖》於二○二二年底公布以來，民青局一直聯同各決策局持續推進青年發展工作，致力培育青年成為國家及香港未來發展的棟樑之才。

民青局一直積極推動多元化的境外青年交流和實習計劃，會繼續為青年人提供更多具特色和深度的實習及交流機會，讓他們深入認識國家發展大勢，同時放眼世界。

民青局已於去年九月成功舉辦第二屆青年發展高峰論壇，論壇以「聯通世界跨越未來」為主題，吸引了超過3 000名青年登記參加，當中有約600人來自內地及海外其他地方。

民青局於二○二三年九月成立「連青人網絡」，目前已有超過27 000名青年加入。民青局在南昌社區中心和毗鄰的通州街臨時街市設置「連青人網絡」的實體互動平台「連青‧南昌」。首階段設施已於去年十二月底投入試行營運。

政府將啟德社區隔離設施改造為「青年驛站」旅舍和青年文化藝術與體育交流空間，命名為「啟航1331」，並於去年有序投入營運，可吸引內地及海外青年來港與本港青年交流。

為更好裝備香港青年，我們會推出「青年人才培養計劃」，增加青年人對以下四個領域的認識和理解。第一，會為青年提供更多參與國際組織實習及國際會議的機會。第二，推出全新的傳媒專題內地實習計劃，為就讀傳理系的青年人提供到內地大型傳媒機構實習的機會。第三，深化本來已有的青年理財教育計劃，為青年人提供金融業及財務規劃的資訊。第四，推出全新的調解工作坊，加強青年人對調解服務及行業的理解。

為回應青年對擁有自住空間的期望，政府會繼續以多管齊下的方式推展「青年宿舍計劃」。現時計劃下推出的宿位數目已由本屆政府上任時的80個，大幅增加到超過3 700個。

家庭及婦女發展方面，我們高度重視本港家庭的健康發展及促進婦女發展的工作。

於二○二三年六月成立的「婦女自強基金」，至今已批准了超過380個項目。為回應社會對基金的熱烈反應，行政長官在去年的《施政報告》宣布將基金的年度撥款由每年2,000萬元增至3,000萬元。

民青局亦於去年（二○二五年）推出「『友』妳啟導」友師計劃，為女大學生配對女性領袖友師。計劃首屆成功招募超過50位女性領袖擔任友師，這些女性領袖包括公營機構和商業機構的總裁，這些女性領袖與80多位學員分享了她們在求學和求職方面的人生經驗。有見及首屆計劃反應熱烈，第二屆計劃的學員名額將增加五成至120個。

在家庭方面，民青局推出了「家庭教育推廣計劃」，每年撥款800萬元，資助非政府機構推行家庭教育項目，加強家庭、家教、家風的建設工作。

民青局在二○二四年十月舉辦了首屆「家庭暨婦女發展高峰會」。我們將於今年舉辦第二屆高峰會，與各界代表共同探討持續推動本港婦女和家庭發展的措施。

地區治理方面，政府於二○二三年順利落實完善地區治理方案，包括強化地區治理架構及重塑區議會，集中精力解決民生難題。

在地區工作方面，民青局及民政總署會持續透過由區議會、地區「三會」和「地區服務及關愛隊伍」（關愛隊）組成的「三駕馬車」在地區織網，緊貼地區脈搏提速提效地處理市民關注的地區大小事務，為市民生活帶來實質改善。民青局及民政總署會不斷優化合作機制，提升地區治理的效能。

支援少數族裔人士方面，政府一向致力為少數族裔人士提供適切服務和支援。民政總署於二○二六年起在服務北區及離島區的兩間少數族裔人士支援服務中心（支援服務中心）各增設一隊少數族裔關愛隊。少數族裔關愛隊亦是今屆政府推出，現有的10間支援服務中心每一間有一隊少數族裔關愛隊，這隊關愛隊與一般關愛隊有少許分別，少數族裔關愛隊會由一位註冊社工帶領少數族裔人士接觸區內少數族裔朋友，現時10間支援服務中心將設立「青年網絡」及「婦女網絡」，更好地連結青年朋友和婦女。

民政總署已於二○二五年十二月增設一間少數族裔傳譯及翻譯服務中心，亦會持續加強宣傳種族共融的信息，包括在二○二五年十月起推出介紹少數族裔文化的電台節目。

大廈管理方面，民政總署正推進多項改善大廈管理的措施，包括已於今年年初在18區區議會設立工作小組，以提升區議員處理大廈管理工作的效能；並計劃於今年下半年與物業管理業監管局合辦論壇，與各界交流及分享大廈及物業管理的最佳做法。

另外，民政總署已於去年六月推出為期一年的「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃，並取得良好的進展。視乎「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃的推展情況，民政總署會考慮將試驗計劃推廣至其他地區。

《2024年建築物管理（修訂）條例》於二○二五年七月十三日正式生效，民政總署已開展下一階段有關《建築物管理條例》（《建管條例》）的檢視工作，以期制訂進一步優化條例的建議方案。

初步擬定的五大修訂方向包括提高大型維修工程及大額採購決定的投票門檻、完善委任代表文書、利益申報制度、清晰會議程序，以及加強主管當局權力等，並會盡快向立法會提交建議修訂方向。

就宏福苑的大廈管理方面，土地審裁處已於一月六日就政府引用《建管條例》第31條提出的申請作出裁決，正式批准解散宏福苑業主立案法團的管理委員會（管委會），並委任華懋集團旗下的合安管理有限公司（合安）為該屋苑的委任管理人。管理人在此次委任中不會收取任何費用，龔如心慈善管理有限公司亦會捐出合共1,000萬元以支付管理人的相關開支。為履行在《建管條例》下管委會的職能，合安正展開一系列關鍵工作。

關愛隊方面，第一期關愛隊自二○二三年第三季全面起動至二○二五年第四季完結，合共探訪了約610 000個長者戶及有需要住戶、提供近100 000次簡單家居或支援服務，以及舉辦了約50 000項地區活動，大家都可看到關愛隊工作的成績。

第二期全港455支關愛隊已在二○二五年十月全面投入服務，循三大方向更為優化——持續無間斷、合區情區需、做更深更廣，更能照顧到小區居民的需要。截至二○二五年十二月，第二期關愛隊已合共探訪約61 000個長者戶和其他有需要住戶，並為他們提供約5 500次簡單家居或其他支援服務，以及舉辦了約2 500項地區活動。

主席，我歡迎委員就民青局的政策和工作計劃提出意見。多謝大家！"
文化體育及旅遊局局長出席立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會政策簡報會開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-27 10:00,2026-01-27 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/27/P2026012700201.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）局長羅淑佩今日（一月二十七日）出席立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會政策簡報會就文化及體育政策措施的開場發言：

多謝主席，各位議員早安。我會盡量簡短介紹。本屆政府成立文體旅局是讓我們可以統整文化、體育和旅遊事宜，目標是讓三個範疇相輔相成，協同發展，但由於歷史原因，文體旅局負責的事務現時分別由三個立法會事務委員會處理。今日我向民政及文化體育事務委員會介紹的內容主要集中文化和體育政策。

文化藝術發展

在文化藝術發展方面，我們在二○二四年十一月公布了《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，我們會繼續推動藍圖內的文創產業發展。弘揚中華文化是當中的重要工作，康樂及文化事務署（康文署）轄下弘揚中華文化辦公室積極推進中華文化節和中國通史系列展覽兩個品牌項目、設立介紹國家發展和成就的博物館及中華文化體驗館。

香港是全球三大藝術品交易中心之一。目前已有不少國際著名的畫廊、拍賣行和藝博會選址香港，其中巴塞爾藝術展香港展會（Art Basel Hong Kong）自從二○一三年首次落戶香港以來，已成為紥根香港的視覺藝術國際盛事。

文體旅局正積極強化國際藝術品交易平台，爭取與巴塞爾藝術展盡快敲定未來數年的合作安排，鞏固香港為區內唯一主辦城市的地位。我們亦會與業界就藝術品交易的稅務、融資、人才等範疇進行研究，以探討適用於香港的政策措施，預計於今年內會完成。

西九文化區管理局（西九管理局）亦會與海內外的文物和藝術品修復機構建立國際合作網路，擴展策展、文物修復及藝術行政人才培訓等。文體旅局會繼續支持西九管理局以自負盈虧方式建設和營運西九項目，透過不同長遠產業發展措施，推動建設香港文藝創意產業鏈，並優化管理局的財務可持續性。

我們已改革重塑康文署表演場地預訂措施，包括把紅館的定位改為演唱會優先，以及發展東九文化中心為長期演出及藝術科技重點場地等。康文署表演場地釐定更明確定位，加上正在興建的新文化設施，從而希望為表演藝術界提供更多場地。此外，我們已於上月公布重點演藝項目計劃的首輪結果，兩個獲選項目——「港漫武俠舞劇《風雲》無量之境」與「《麥兜故事》舞台劇」——均為香港原創IP（知識產權），展示出本地藝術人才的能力和創意。

我們將透過包括香港流行文化節、「亞藝無疆」藝術節、香港演藝博覽、香港非遺月等文藝旗艦品牌項目，吸引本地市民和遊客參與。此外，我們亦會加強推廣地區非遺特色，打造「香港處處有非遺」。

我們會藉政策創新，推進檢討藝團資助制度的工作，包括採用績效指標作評核，以及建立主要藝團的「進出機制」等，透過引入以表現和藝術水平掛鈎為標準的制度，確保資源能夠有效運用，並鼓勵藝團持續追求藝術上的卓越成就。

康文署早前選取了24項轄下的設施，邀請有興趣的機構就該些設施引入市場營運模式以提供更多元的增值活動提交意向書，包括開放作租用、在博物館閉館日出租場地舉辦商業或私人活動等，反應不俗。目前署方正整理收到的意見，計劃於今年上半年委聘專業服務承辦商以執行計劃。

體育發展

體育方面，由粵港澳三地共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會已於去年十一月和十二月圓滿舉行，寫下香港體育發展的重要里程碑。這不僅展現香港承辦大型活動、體育運動會的能力，亦為粵港澳三地合作舉辦更多大型盛事奠下穩固基礎。我們會善用這次成功經驗，加強推動大灣區內合作，為國家體育強國建設貢獻香港力量。

啟德體育園是香港體育盛事化及產業化的重要載體，在去年三月一日正式啓用後已成為大型體育及娛樂盛事的新據點。

自啓用後短短十多個月內，多項大型體育和娛樂盛事已在園區舉行。其中，啟德主場館至今已成功舉辦50場大型體育盛事和演唱會，累計吸引超過180萬觀眾人次；預計今年除了載譽歸來的體育盛事，大型演唱會亦會陸續上演。文體旅局會繼續監督好啟德體育園的營運工作，積極推動「體育+盛事」發展，鞏固香港「亞洲盛事之都」的地位。

我們會重新檢視香港大球場的定位，希望與啟德體育園發揮協同作用，包括會善用現有設施支持體育發展。事實上，我們非常歡迎體育界就可行的短期或較長期方案提交具體建議，好讓我們可多方面照顧不同項目的需要和發展。

在二○二五年，有25項賽事獲頒授「M」品牌認可。我們會繼續通過「M」品牌計劃，支持大型國際體育賽事在香港舉行，更有策略性、更有效和精準地分配資源，以支持高質素和具經濟效益的大型體育活動。政府已成功與世界級男子職業高爾夫球聯賽LIV Golf達成長遠合作安排，落實有關賽事在二○二六年和二○二七年在香港舉行。

為支持香港運動員全力備戰今年名古屋亞運會（亞洲運動會），文體旅局會確保對精英運動員的支援能緊貼運動員需要和國際體壇最新發展。香港體育學院已在二○二五年四月實施經檢討後的「精英運動員直接財政資助」，並會繼續透過「運動科研資助計劃」推展運動科學和運動醫學，利用科研成果強化運動員訓練。

在提升體育專業化方面，二○二五年十二月十一日正式啓動由律政司推出、文體旅局支持的「體育爭議解決先導計劃」，透過調解與仲裁處理體育糾紛，以公平、高效、便捷的制度保障體育產業的長遠發展。另外，中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會（港協暨奧委會）現時已和各體育總會逐步實施《機構管治守則》。

此外，文體旅局會透過體育總會支持亞洲或國際體育組織總會落戶香港，同時提供資助鼓勵體育總會積極參與亞洲和國際體育組織的有關工作，以提升香港在國際體壇的話語權、影響力及連繫能力。

港協暨奧委會將於二○二六年十二月在香港舉辦國家及地區奧委會協會全體代表大會，即ANOC大會。

未來一年，文體旅局會積極推動香港文化藝術及體育發展。我們歡迎委員多向我們提出意見。

多謝主席。"

Asian Financial Forum assembles global financial and business leaders to co-create new horizons amid evolving landscape (with photos),2026-01-26 21:04,2026-01-26 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600630.htm,"The 19th Asian Financial Forum (AFF) opened today (January 26). Featuring the theme ""Co-creating New Horizons Amid an Evolving Landscape"", the forum gathered heavyweight speakers from around the world to exchange insights on the latest developments in the financial market and to explore ways to foster co-operation among economies to gain mutual benefits in times of change.

The AFF, co-organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), has been a flagship financial event in the region. The two-day forum is expected to attract over 3 600 participants from more than 60 countries or regions. This year's AFF has brought together over 150 distinguished speakers, including government officials, representatives from central banks and regulatory bodies, financial and business leaders, scholars and economists, to discuss key financial and economic trends, as well as emerging opportunities in various facets of the financial sector, including asset and wealth management, fintech, trade finance, gold and precious metals trading, green finance, insurance and risk management. This year's forum also includes significant upgrades to its content, introducing the new Global Business Summit. The summit explores how finance empowers businesses, focusing on Mainland economic opportunities and examining how Hong Kong leverages the synergy between finance and industries to support Mainland enterprises in ""going global"" while facilitating the ""bringing in"" of international businesses.

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, when addressing the opening session of the AFF this morning, highlighted Hong Kong's prowess as an international financial hub. He said, ""Hong Kong's financial regulatory system is robust, and our financial market stands out for its deep liquidity, innovative products and world-class investor protection. We also boast a highly educated workforce, a welcoming environment for global talent and transparent financial regulations aligned with international standards.""

He stressed that these strengths are widely recognised, citing the fact that Hong Kong ranked third, globally, and first in Asia, in the most recent Global Financial Centres Index, while placing third in the 2025 World Competitiveness Yearbook, up two places over the previous year. He added that the city will focus on three fronts to further boost its status as an international financial centre. First, Hong Kong will further reinforce its existing strengths, including those in the equity market, the bond market, and the asset management and wealth management sector. Second, Hong Kong will expedite the development of new growth areas, including building an international gold trading market and commodities trading ecosystem in Hong Kong. Third, international exchanges and co-operation will remain a priority for Hong Kong, including assisting companies interested in re-domiciling to Hong Kong.

In the opening session, the Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), Mr Zou Lan said that China's financial market has developed rapidly in recent years, with its international influence and attractiveness being continuously enhanced. As Renminbi is more widely used in cross-boundary transactions, Hong Kong has emerged as the world's largest and most influential offshore Renminbi business hub. He said that as a next step to steadfastly support and further steadily advance the development of Hong Kong's offshore Renminbi market, the PBOC will focus on four key directions: first, to increase the scale of Renminbi funding arrangements to provide more ample liquidity support for Hong Kong's offshore market; second, to continue to advance financial market connectivity, enriching liquidity management and risk hedging tools for overseas investors; third, to expand the supply of offshore Renminbi sovereign bonds to enhance market liquidity; and fourth, to support the development of Hong Kong's gold market to strengthen the offshore Renminbi market function of Hong Kong.

  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, delivered welcome remarks at the keynote luncheon. He said, ""In a world where economies are reconfiguring value chains and seeking more resilient, diversified partnerships, Hong Kong stands out as a reliable, trusted, resourceful and well-positioned partner, bridging the Mainland and the world.""

  He emphasised that Hong Kong’s significance will only grow, pointing out that Hong Kong serves as a gateway for global investors to access China's innovation-driven opportunities. In the realms of finance, he highlighted two key specific areas: as the premier two-way international fundraising platform, welcoming both Mainland and international companies to list in Hong Kong to support their growth; and as the world’s leading offshore Renminbi (RMB) hub, with a wide range of RMB-denominated investment and risk management products for global investors.

  He added that at a time of global fragmentation, Hong Kong will continue to remain open for business, and welcome partners from around the world in shaping the future of Asia – and the world at large – together.
  
The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, signed today a co-operation agreement with the Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Mr Yu Wenjian, in the presence of Mr Lee; Mr Zou Lan; Member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei; and the Executive Deputy Director of the Office of the Financial Commission of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Mr Zhou Xiaoquan. The co-operation agreement marks a new milestone for deepening the co-operation between gold markets in the two places, such as establishing a high-level, collaborative governance structure for Hong Kong's gold central clearing system, opening new avenues for physical infrastructure synergy and market interconnectivity. Separately, a panel discussion on gold exchange was held in the afternoon, analysing the market developments of the global gold industry and Hong Kong's role.

Mr Hui also chaired a plenary session today themed ""Fostering Co-operation for Shared Success"". Mr Hui and the panellists shared their thoughts on how to strengthen communication and dialogue among economies and pursue shared development amid the evolving global political and economic landscape. Speakers joining this session included the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance of Slovenia, Mr Klemen Boštjančič; the Minister of Treasury and Finance of Türkiye, Mr Mehmet Şimşek; the President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Ms Zou Jiayi; and the Vice-President (East and Southeast Asia, and the Pacific) of Asian Development Bank, Mr Scott Morris.

Former President of the European Commission, former Prime Minister of Portugal, and Chairman of Advisory Board at Goldman Sachs International, Dr José Manuel Barroso, also delivered a keynote speech at the luncheon, sharing his views on the changes in global political and economic landscapes and their impact on international markets.

The 19th AFF will continue tomorrow (January 27). The inaugural Global Business Summit, co-organised by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the HKTDC, and the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, will be held. Focusing on how finance empowers businesses, the summit will cover the potential of high-growth industries such as artificial intelligence and technology, robotics, high-growth consumer products, and biopharmaceuticals and healthcare. It will also explore how Hong Kong can support Mainland enterprises going global, and the prospects of foreign enterprises entering the Mainland market. The summit will feature heavyweight speakers. Among them, Mr Chan; the Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei; and Vice Governor of the People's Government of Hunan Province Mr Wang Junshou will deliver speeches.

Business leader, investor and philanthropist Mr Paul Polman will be the speaker for the keynote luncheon tomorrow. The forum will also feature thematic workshops on topics such as artificial intelligence, sustainable banking, and family office.

​亞洲金融論壇匯聚環球財金商界翹楚  新局中協力共謀多贏（附圖）,2026-01-26 20:55,2026-01-26 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600628.htm,"第十九屆亞洲金融論壇今日（一月二十六日）開幕，今屆論壇主題為「變局中協力新局中多贏」。來自世界各地的重量級嘉賓就金融巿場的最新發展交流意見，並探討如何在變局中加強合作創造多贏。

由香港特別行政區政府及香港貿易發展局（香港貿發局）合辦的亞洲金融論壇是區內的旗艦金融盛事，一連兩天的論壇預計吸引超過3 600位來自60多個國家或地區的與會者。今屆論壇雲集逾150位傑出演講嘉賓，包括政府官員、中央銀行和監管機構代表、金融和商界領袖、學者及經濟學家，深入討論金融及經濟趨勢、不同金融領域——包括資產及財富管理、金融科技、貿易融資、黃金與貴金屬交易、綠色金融、保險與風險管理等——的新機遇。今屆論壇亦加強內容，引入全新的「全球產業峰會」，探討金融賦能產業，並聚焦探討內地經濟的機遇，以及香港如何透過金融與產業相互合作的協同效應，支持內地企業「走出去」與推動國際企業「引進來」。

行政長官李家超今早在開幕環節致辭時強調香港作為國際金融中心的實力。他說：「我們的金融監管體系穩健，金融市場更以其流動性充裕、產品創新和達世界級的投資者保障制度著稱。我們擁有具高教育程度的人才庫、廣納全球人才的開放環境，以及公開透明而與國際標準接軌的金融監管法規，讓我們引以為傲。」

他強調這些優勢廣受認可，並列舉了香港在最新的《全球金融中心指數》排名全球第三、亞洲第一；並在《2025年世界競爭力年報》中排名全球第三，比之前一年躍升兩位。他表示，香港將聚焦三大方向以進一步加強國際金融中心地位：第一，進一步提升股票市場、債券市場和資產及財富管理行業等的固有優勢；第二，加快開拓新增長點，包括在香港建立國際黃金交易市場及大宗商品交易生態圈；第三，香港將繼續全力深化國際交流合作，包括協助有興趣的公司遷冊來港。

在開幕環節上，中國人民銀行副行長鄒瀾致辭時表示，中國金融市場近年快速發展，國際影響力和吸引力不斷提升。隨着人民幣在跨境交易中被更廣泛地使用，香港已成為全球規模最大、最具影響力的人民幣離岸業務樞紐。下一步，中國人民銀行將聚焦四個重點方向，堅定支持並繼續穩步推進香港離岸人民幣市場建設：一是增加人民幣業務資金安排規模，為香港離岸市場提供更加充裕的流動性支持；二是繼續推進金融市場互聯互通，豐富境外投資者流動性管理和風險對沖工具；三是增加離岸人民幣國債供給規模，提高市場流動性；四是支持香港黃金市場建設，增強香港離岸人民幣市場功能。

財政司司長陳茂波在專題午餐會致歡迎辭時表示：「當前全球各經濟體正重新配置產業鏈和供應鏈，尋求更具韌性及多元化的合作關係。香港是可靠和可信任的夥伴，聯繫廣泛、位置得天獨厚，是連接內地與世界的橋樑。」

他強調，香港的戰略重要性會與日俱增，是國際投資者把握中國創新發展機遇的重要門戶。其中，在金融領域方面，陳茂波提到兩個重點範疇：一、香港作為首選的國際融資平台，支持內地及國際企業來港上市，支持其壯大發展；二、香港作為全球領先的離岸人民幣業務樞紐，為國際投資者提供多元化的人民幣計價投資及風險管理工具。

他指出，在地緣割裂的時代，香港將繼續堅持開放，歡迎來自世界各地的合作夥伴，並攜手共創亞洲和全球的未來。

財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇今日在李家超、鄒瀾、上海市委常委、常務副市長吳偉，及上海市委金融委員會辦公室常務副主任周小全見證下，與上海黃金交易所理事長余文建簽署合作協議。協議標誌滬港兩地黃金市場深化合作邁向新里程，包括建立香港黃金中央結算系統的高層次協作治理架構、開拓實物基礎設施協同及市場互聯互通新途徑等。另外，有關黃金交易的討論環節亦於下午舉行，分析國際黃金市場的狀況以及香港當中的角色。

許正宇今日亦主持了以「促進合作攜手共贏」為題的主題討論環節。許正宇及演講嘉賓分享經濟體如何在全球政經變局中加強溝通對話，攜手共謀發展的見解。該環節的演講嘉賓包括斯洛文尼亞副總理兼財政部長Klemen Boštjančič、土耳其國庫和財政部部長Mehmet Şimşek、亞洲基礎設施投資銀行行長鄒加怡及亞洲開發銀行副行長（東亞、東南亞和太平洋）Scott Morris。

歐洲聯盟委員會執委會前主席、葡萄牙前總理、高盛國際顧問委員會主席José Manuel Barroso博士也在午餐會上發表了主題演講，分享他對全球政治及經濟形勢變化及其對國際市場影響的見解。

第十九屆亞洲金融論壇明日（一月二十七日）繼續，並會舉行由財庫局、香港貿發局及引進重點企業辦公室合辦的首屆全球產業峰會，聚焦金融賦能產業，涵蓋人工智能與科技、機械人、高增長消費品、生物醫藥與醫療健康等高增長產業的潛力，並探討香港支持內地企業走向全球，以及外資進入內地市場的前景。峰會邀請到多位重量級嘉賓，當中陳茂波、上海市常務副市長吳偉及湖南省人民政府副省長王俊壽將會致辭。

明日的專題午餐會將由商業領袖、投資人、慈善家Paul Polman擔任演講嘉賓。論壇亦舉行人工智能、可持續銀行業、家族辦公室等專題工作坊。

DH follows up on Nipah virus infection cluster in India,2026-01-26 19:45,2026-01-26 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600674.htm,"In light of reports indicating a cluster of a Nipah virus infection in a certain region of India, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (January 26) that it has proactively sought further information from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Indian health authorities. The CHP is also conducting health screenings on inbound travellers from the affected area who exhibit suspected symptoms, with an aim of promptly referring suspected cases to hospitals for investigation. Currently, there are no imported or local cases of Nipah virus infection in Hong Kong.

   Preliminary information indicated that a hospital in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, has recorded five confirmed cases of Nipah virus infection since mid-January of this year. The cluster was mainly due to nosocomial transmission and primarily involved healthcare workers, with no reported deaths or cross-border transmissions to date. Approximately 100 close contacts have been quarantined and tested in India. The CHP's current risk assessment indicates a low risk of importation of Nipah virus into Hong Kong.

Nipah virus was first identified during outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore from 1998 to 1999, affecting pig farm workers and individuals with close contact with pigs. It can affect various animals, including pigs, horses, goats, sheep, cats and dogs. Over the past two decades, multiple outbreaks of human Nipah virus infections were recorded in Bangladesh and India, typically occurring between December and April. Transmission primarily occurs through the consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats. India's most recent outbreak occurred in Kerala in mid-2025, involving four cases.

""Nipah virus infection is an emerging zoonotic disease. Fruit bats are the natural host for the virus. The virus is mainly transmitted through direct contact with sick animals via their contaminated respiratory droplets, nasal secretions and tissues. It can also be transmitted via consuming food contaminated with urine, droppings or saliva from infected bats, usually fruits or fruit products (particularly raw date palm sap). Human-to-human transmission is also possible through close contact with contaminated secretions and excretions of infected persons. Such transmission has been reported in patients' household and healthcare settings,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Patients infected with Nipah virus can be asymptomatic. Early symptoms include flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, vomiting, sore throat and muscle aches. Other symptoms include dizziness, drowsiness and a decrease in consciousness. Severe cases may develop complications such as pneumonia, seizure, encephalitis, coma or even death. The case fatality rate ranges from approximately 40 per cent to 75 per cent. Among the patients who survive acute encephalitis, around 20 per cent of them may have persistent nerve problems. Currently, there is no specific treatment or medication for Nipah virus infection. The mainstay of treatment is limited to supportive care. Symptoms usually start to develop around four to 14 days after exposure, but onset may occur as late as 45 days.

""Hong Kong has the ability to detect infections of unknown causes and emerging infectious diseases at boundary control points and in hospitals. On the immigration level, the DH conducts medical assessments for sick travellers at all boundary control points and refers them to hospitals for medical examinations as needed. The CHP has a robust communicable disease surveillance and notification mechanism that enables medical professionals to report suspected cases. So far, no cases of Nipah virus infection have been recorded. Although there are no direct flights between Kolkata and Hong Kong, the CHP will step up health screenings for passengers arriving from India at the airport as a precautionary measure. Port Health staff have been arranged to carry out temperature screenings for travellers at relevant flight gates, perform medical assessments on symptomatic travellers and refer suspected cases with potential public health implications to hospitals for examination,"" said Dr Tsui.

Dr Tsui reminded the public to take the following measures to reduce infection risk if travel to Nipah virus-affected areas is unavoidable:

Avoid contact with wild animals or sick farm animals, especially bats, farmed pigs, horses, domestic and feral cats.
Avoid areas where bats are known to roost.
Observe good personal hygiene; wash hands frequently with liquid soap and water, especially after contact with animals or their droppings/secretions, and after taking caring of or visiting sick people.
Observe food hygiene by thoroughly washing and peeling fruits before consumption. Fruits with signs of bat bites or found on the ground should not be consumed. Avoid drinking raw date palm sap, toddy or other juice.


The CHP will monitor the situation and implement appropriate prevention and control measures based on risk assessments to safeguard public health and the well-being of citizens."
DH reiterates importance of Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme,2026-01-26 19:30,2026-01-26 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600665.htm,"​In response to media enquiries about whether adjustments to the vaccines covered by the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme (HKCIP) are needed, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 26) emphasised that all public health policies and medical advice must be based on scientific evidence. The CHP categorically rejected any suggestion to delay or discontinue the hepatitis B vaccination for newborns, as this would pose irreversible and significant public health risks to the community. Furthermore, the CHP reaffirms that vaccines under the HKCIP are one of the most effective tools for safeguarding public health and preventing and controlling infectious diseases, with their safety and effectiveness fully supported by ample scientific evidence from long-term practice. The CHP reminds parents to ensure their children receive timely vaccinations under the HKCIP to effectively protect them from contracting serious vaccine-preventable diseases.

""The Government has comprehensively and long promoted childhood immunisation. Vaccines that contribute to safeguarding children's health and overall public health have been incorporated into the HKCIP and other government vaccination programmes, such as the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Programmes. Thanks to the trust and support of parents, schools and the healthcare professionals in the HKCIP over the years, immunisation coverage has remained extremely high, successfully keeping the incidence of related childhood infectious diseases in Hong Kong at extremely low levels. With the help of vaccines, smallpox was eradicated globally in 1980, and poliomyelitis was eliminated in Hong Kong in 2000. Measles and rubella were successful eliminated in Hong Kong in 2016 and 2021 respectively,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) under the CHP regularly reviews vaccines for various preventable diseases by assessing the epidemiology in Hong Kong, the latest recommendations on immunisation from the World Health Organization (WHO), scientific developments and applications of new vaccines, updates on vaccine components, cost-effectiveness studies and the experiences of other health authorities. The SCVPD then makes recommendations to the DH from a public health perspective. The HKCIP is tailored to local epidemiological conditions and has been proven safe and effective. Its achievements in safeguarding public health are evident. Members of the public should not blindly follow practices in certain overseas regions and develop unnecessary concerns about the HKCIP's long-standing effectiveness,"" he added.

HKCIP
--------

Based on the SCVPD's recommendations, infants from birth to students of Primary Six should receive multiple vaccines and booster doses under the HKCIP to prevent 12 infectious diseases, namely tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, pneumococcal infection, chickenpox, measles, mumps, rubella (also known as ""German Measles"") and human papillomavirus infection.

Children must complete all doses according to the schedule recommended by the HKCIP to ensure adequate immune protection. Unvaccinated children lack immunity against relevant infectious diseases and are susceptible to infections such as measles and pertussis. Young children infected with these diseases may develop severe complications. Furthermore, unvaccinated children may become a conduit for transmitting infectious diseases, indirectly affecting the herd immunity of the community.

""Measles is an example of a disease that is experiencing a global resurgence due to declining childhood vaccination rates. Over the past three years, measles outbreaks have spread to multiple regions worldwide. Recently, some overseas countries have reported large numbers of measles cases. North America (including the United States and Canada) and Southeast Asia (including Indonesia, Cambodia and the Philippines) have experienced persistent outbreaks due to low vaccination coverage rates. Furthermore, Japan and Australia recorded an increase in measles cases last year. Most of the cases overseas involved individuals who had never received the measles vaccine or whose vaccination history was unknown, underscoring the importance of maintaining high overall vaccination rates and herd immunity,"" Dr Tsui said.

Hepatitis B
--------------

According to the WHO recommendations, receiving the hepatitis B vaccine at birth and completing the three-dose series on schedule are crucial measures for preventing infection and reducing the public health burden of hepatitis B.

Hepatitis B is transmitted through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. The major transmission routes include mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), through contact with blood and sexual contact. In chronic hepatitis B (CHB) endemic places, including Hong Kong, most people with CHB are infected through MTCT. The younger the age of acquiring the infection, the higher the risk of developing CHB. If a newborn is infected, there is up to a 90 per cent chance of developing CHB. CHB is the primary cause of liver cancer, cirrhosis and liver failure among the population in Hong Kong.

""Since 1988, the universal childhood hepatitis B immunisation programme has been implemented in Hong Kong. The current vaccination coverage rate among preschool children has reached 99 per cent. According to the Population Health Survey 2020-22, prevalence of hepatitis B among those under 35 years old has dropped below 1 per cent, reflecting Hong Kong's successful progress towards realising the goal of a 'hepatitis B-free generation'. The provision of hepatitis B vaccination to newborns has been instrumental in this achievement,"" Dr Tsui said.

The Government has attached great importance to the public health threat posed by viral hepatitis, and announced the Hong Kong Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2025-2030 (Action Plan) at the end of last year. Through the implementation of a series of strategies and initiatives to prevent and control viral hepatitis, the Action Plan aims to further alleviate the public health burden posed by viral hepatitis. Preventing new infections is one of the four strategic axes of the Action Plan. Under this strategic axis, sustaining the existing effective MTCT prevention measures and maintaining their high coverage rates, including neonatal hepatitis B vaccination, are crucial for eliminating new hepatitis B infections.

The DH will continue to work with the SCVPD to monitor the situation of various vaccine-preventable diseases and scientific developments of new vaccines. Experts will be consulted as required to review and update the HKCIP in a timely manner."

武延軍副主席（廣州市政協副主席）、彭徐美雲會長（廣州地區政協香港委員聯誼會會長）、各位理事、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！廣州地區政協香港委員聯誼會在一九九五年成立，剛剛度過了30歲生日。我首先恭賀聯誼會30周年生日快樂，會務蒸蒸日上。

廣州與香港血脈相連，文化一脈相承，人民情誼深厚，在政、商、民等各個領域一直都合作密切。廣州與香港都是粵港澳大灣區的中心城市，共同擔當着區域發展核心引擎的責任。

近年，港穗兩地積極推進不同的合作項目。我們共同推動南沙粵港澳重大合作平台建設，《南沙方案》自二○二二年實施以來，已在多個重點任務取得顯著成效。

南沙目前實施「港人港稅」，為在內地的港人港企帶來新發展機遇。在教育方面，香港科技大學（廣州）在南沙開校，致力培養具國際視野的創新型人才、推動科創成果轉化。在資金融通方面，香港交易所入股廣州期貨交易所，是境外機構首次獲准入股內地的期貨交易所，共同推進大灣區綠色低碳市場的發展。以至在馬產業方面，雙方共同推動馬匹跨境運輸、培育馬產業人才等的合作，推進大灣區馬匹運動轉型升級。

在去年發布的《全球創新指數》百強創新集群之中，「深圳—香港—廣州」集群首次位列全球第一，這是我們在連續五年蟬聯全球第二位後登上全新高位，反映大灣區的創新能力在國際上獲得高度肯定，彰顯穗港兩地優勢互補的成效。

特區政府全力推動香港深度參與粵港澳大灣區建設，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。我在《施政報告》指出要繼續深化粵港澳三地規則銜接和機制對接，提升人流、物流、數據流、資金流，並積極發揮香港「內聯外通」的功能，服務更多內地企業通過香港「出海」。

我有信心，港穗之間未來將迎來更高水平合作，為推進粵港澳大灣區建設帶來關鍵作用。穗港合作機遇無限，而當中不可或缺的，正是在廣州市政協和市屬十一個區政協擔任香港委員的愛國愛港力量。

廣州地區政協香港委員聯誼會成立30年以來，一直積極擔當穗港橋樑，團結各位政協委員一同為兩地發展建言獻策，我肯定你們的貢獻。我相信聯誼會將繼續發揮所長，繼續凝聚愛國愛港力量，促進穗港之間以及大灣區的雙向交流，並以優勢互補、互惠共贏的精神，助力穗港兩地高質量發展。

在此，我祝願國家富強昌盛，穗港兩地物阜民康。我亦祝賀聯誼會百尺竿頭，更進一步，迎來更多個精彩30年。我祝願在座各位身體健康、工作順利。多謝大家。"

衞生署重申「香港兒童免疫接種計劃」的重要性,2026-01-26 17:45,2026-01-26 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600487.htm,"就傳媒查詢有關「香港兒童免疫接種計劃」（「兒童免疫接種計劃」）所涵蓋的疫苗是否會作出調整，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十六日）表示，任何公共衞生政策及醫學建議必須以科學實證為本，絕不認同任何涉及延遲或取消新生兒接種乙型肝炎疫苗的建議，以免對市民健康構成不可逆轉的重大公共衞生風險。中心同時重申，「兒童免疫接種計劃」的疫苗是保障公共衞生、防控傳染病的其中一個最有效的工具，其安全性和有效性在長年實踐下，有充分的科學實證支持，提醒家長應安排子女按「兒童免疫接種計劃」適時接種疫苗，以有效保障他們避免感染多種疫苗可預防的嚴重疾病。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「政府一直全方位推動兒童疫苗接種，將有助保障兒童健康及整體公共衞生的疫苗納入『兒童免疫接種計劃』或其他政府疫苗接種計劃，例如季節性流感疫苗接種計劃。有賴家長、學校及醫護多年來對『兒童免疫接種計劃』的信賴和支持，免疫接種覆蓋率一直維持在極高水平，成功將相關兒童傳染病在本港的發病率維持在極低水平。在疫苗的幫助下，全球自一九八○年消滅天花，香港亦於二○○○年消滅小兒麻痺症，並分別於二○一六年及二○二一年成功消除麻疹及風疹。」

他續說：「中心轄下的疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會（科學委員會）就各種可預防疾病的疫苗，定期檢討本地的流行病學情況、世界衞生組織對免疫接種的最新建議、新疫苗的科學發展與應用、製劑的更新和成本效益，以及其他衞生當局的經驗，從公共衞生角度向衞生署提出建議。『兒童免疫接種計劃』切合本地的流行病學情況，並證實安全有效，對保障公共衞生的成果有目共睹，市民不應盲目仿傚個別海外地區的做法而對一直行之有效的『兒童免疫接種計劃』產生不必要的疑慮。」

「兒童免疫接種計劃」
——————————

根據科學委員會的建議，初生嬰兒至小學六年級的學生需要在「兒童免疫接種計劃」下接種多種疫苗及加強劑，以預防十二種傳染病，包括結核病、小兒麻痺症、乙型肝炎、白喉、百日咳、破傷風、肺炎鏈球菌感染、水痘、麻疹、流行性腮腺炎、風疹（又稱「德國麻疹」）和人類乳頭瘤病毒感染。

兒童必須按「兒童免疫接種計劃」建議的時間表適時完成接種所有劑次，才能確保有足夠的免疫保護。未完成接種疫苗的兒童因未具備對相關傳染病的免疫力，容易受到感染，例如麻疹、百日咳等，而幼童感染這些疾病可能導致嚴重併發症。此外，未接種疫苗的兒童可能成為傳染病傳播的途徑，間接影響社區的整體免疫力。

徐樂堅醫生說：「麻疹就是一個因兒童疫苗接種率下降而導致全球再次大規模爆發的例子。在過去三年，麻疹疫情蔓延至全球多個地區。近期部分海外國家的麻疹個案維持在高水平，其中北美洲（包括美國及加拿大）及東南亞地區（包括印尼、柬埔寨和菲律賓），因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低而出現麻疹持續爆發。另外，日本和澳洲去年錄得的麻疹個案亦有所上升。海外大部分個案未曾接種麻疹疫苗或疫苗接種史不詳，反映了維持整體高疫苗接種率及群體免疫力的重要性。」

乙型肝炎
————

根據世界衞生組織建議，於出生時接種並依時完成共三針的乙型肝炎疫苗，是一項對預防感染及減輕由乙型肝炎引致的公共衞生負擔至為重要的舉措。

乙型肝炎可透過接觸感染者的血液或體液而傳播，其主要傳播途徑包括母嬰傳播、血液傳播及性接觸傳播。在慢性乙型肝炎流行地區（包括香港），大部分患者是經母嬰傳播感染。感染時年齡越小，發展成慢性乙型肝炎的風險越高。新生兒若受感染，有高達九成機會發展為慢性乙型肝炎。慢性乙型肝炎是本港人口罹患肝癌、肝硬化和肝衰竭的主要原因。

徐樂堅醫生說：「香港自一九八八年推行普及兒童乙型肝炎疫苗接種計劃，目前學前兒童接種率達99%。根據二○二○至二二年度人口健康調查，35歲以下年齡組別的乙肝感染率已降至1%以下，反映香港正成功邁向『無乙肝新一代』的目標，為新生兒接種乙肝疫苗厥功至偉。」

政府一直關注病毒性肝炎帶來的公共衞生威脅，並於去年底公布《2025–2030年香港病毒性肝炎行動計劃》（《行動計劃》），透過落實一系列預防及控制病毒性肝炎的策略和工作，藉以進一步減輕病毒性肝炎的公共衞生負擔。預防感染是《行動計劃》四項核心策略之一，當中持續實施現行有效的母嬰傳播預防措施並維持其高覆蓋率，包括新生嬰兒的乙型肝炎疫苗接種，是預防乙型肝炎新增感染的關鍵策略。

衞生署會繼續聯同科學委員會持續監察各種疫苗可預防疾病的情況及新疫苗的科學發展，並按需要徵詢專家的意見，適時檢討及更新計劃。"
衞生署正跟進印度的尼帕病毒感染群組,2026-01-26 17:45,2026-01-26 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600552.htm,"鑑於有報道指印度個別地區出現尼帕病毒的感染群組，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十六日）表示，已主動向世界衞生組織（世衞）和印度衞生當局索取進一步資訊，並對來自有關爆發地區並出現疑似徵狀的入境旅客進行健康篩查，以盡快轉介疑似個案到醫院進行調查。目前，本港沒有錄得尼帕病毒感染的輸入或本地案例。

初步資料顯示，當地西孟加拉邦加爾各答的一間醫院自今年一月中起錄得五宗確診尼帕病毒感染個案，主要為醫院內傳播，全部涉及醫護人員，暫未有死亡個案或跨境傳播個案。當地已隔離約一百名密切接觸者，並進行檢測。目前中心的風險評估認為尼帕病毒傳入香港的風險為低。

尼帕病毒在一九九八至一九九九年在馬來西亞和新加坡發生涉及養豬場工人和與豬有密切接觸人士的爆發中首次發現，它可以影響多種動物，包括豬隻、馬、山羊、綿羊、貓和狗。過去二十年，孟加拉及印度曾多次錄得人類感染尼帕病毒的爆發，通常於十二月至四月期間發生，主要透過受果蝠污染的生椰棗汁傳播。印度對上一次爆發於去年中在喀拉拉邦發生，涉及四宗個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「尼帕病毒感染是一種新發的人畜共患疾病。果蝠是病毒的天然宿主。這種病毒主要是通過直接接觸受感染動物的呼吸道飛沫、鼻腔分泌物和組織傳播。它也可以通過食用受感染蝙蝠尿液、糞便或唾液污染的食物而傳播，通常是水果或水果產品（特別是椰棗原汁）。尼帕病毒感染也可在人與人之間傳播，主要是通過密切接觸受感染病人的分泌物和排泄物，曾在病人的家庭和醫療機構中報告。」

受尼帕病毒感染的患者可以沒有徵狀。早期徵狀包括與流感類似的徵狀，如發燒、頭痛、嘔吐、喉嚨痛和肌肉酸痛。其他徵狀包括頭暈、嗜睡和知覺下降。嚴重的病例可能會出現併發症，如肺炎、癲癇、腦炎、昏迷，甚至死亡。個案病死率約為40％至75％。在急性腦炎康復的患者中，約有20％可能持續出現神經線的問題。目前尚未有針對尼帕病毒感染的療法及藥物，治療主要限於支持療法。症狀通常在感染尼帕病毒後約四至14天開始出現，但亦可能長達45天。

徐樂堅醫生補充：「香港具備在口岸和醫院偵測不明原因感染及新發傳染病的能力。在入境層面，衞生署於各口岸持續為不適的入境人士進行醫學評估，必要時轉送醫院檢查。中心有完善傳染病監測機制及呈報系統，讓醫護人員通報懷疑傳染病個案。目前未錄得任何尼帕病毒感染個案。雖然加爾各答與香港無直航班機，為審慎起見，中心將會在機場加強對由印度抵港的航班的旅客進行健康篩檢，包括安排港口衞生人員在相關航班閘口為旅客進行體溫監測、對出現病徵的旅客進行醫學評估，並將對公共衞生有影響的感染個案轉介到醫院作醫學檢查。」

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，若必須前往受尼帕病毒影響的地方時，應採取以下措施以降低感染風險：


避免接觸野生動物或染病的農場動物，尤其是蝙蝠、養殖豬、馬、家貓和野貓。
避免前往蝙蝠棲息地。
注重個人衞生，經常用洗手液和清水洗手，特別是接觸動物或其分泌物／糞便後，及照顧或探望病人後。
注意食物衞生，在食用水果前應徹底洗淨並去皮，切勿進食可能被蝙蝠咬過或從地上撿起的水果。避免飲用生的椰棗原汁、棕櫚汁或其他果汁。


中心會跟進事件和按風險評估採取適當防控措施，保障公共衞生和市民健康。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-26 17:30,2026-01-26 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600526.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月二十六日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-26 17:30,2026-01-26 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600527.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 26), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
Speech by Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services) at International Financial Week: Development & Innovation of AI & Digital Finance (English only) (with photos),2026-01-26 17:20,2026-01-26 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600554.htm,"Following is the speech by the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services), Ms Salina Yan, at the International Financial Week: Development & Innovation of AI & Digital Finance today (January 26):

Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,

It's my great pleasure to join you all at this afternoon's parallel event of the Asian Financial Forum.

Financial stability and financial development are two sides of a coin, particularly in the digital age. Today's event on ""Development and Innovation of AI & Digital Finance"", organised by the Alliance for Financial Stability with Information Technology and the Hong Kong Institution for Infrastructural Finance, is most timely. Innovation drives our future, while a robust regulatory and security regime contributes to enduring progress.

Thanks to the continuous market reforms in Hong Kong that benchmark global competitiveness, and our unique connection to the Chinese Mainland market made possible by the successful implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong as a premier international financial centre now ranks third globally and first in Asia-Pacific in the Global Financial Centres Index. Among the specific areas, Hong Kong's ranking in fintech has leapt to first in the world. Last year, funds raised through IPOs reached $285.8 billion, an increase of 225 per cent over that of 2024, and we regained our number one ranking for IPOs funds raised in 2025. The average daily turnover was near $250 billion, an impressive increase of 90 per cent over 2024. All these testify to the resilience of the Hong Kong financial market against all odds.

In growing further the liquidity and breadth of our capital markets, Hong Kong stands ready to harness the potential brought about by technology advancement and innovations. In the financial services area, the Hong Kong SAR Government has issued three rounds of tokenised government green bonds for sustainable development over the past three years, proving with success the digitally native form of multi-currency green bonds and utilisation of central bank e-money and, in this case, e-CNY and e-HKD, in the settlement process. We have introduced legislation that allows the licensing of virtual assets trading exchanges. There are now 11 of these exchanges operating in Hong Kong, and there are more in the application process. At the moment, we are formulating legislation for the licensing regimes for the dealing and custodian services of virtual assets, after doing in-depth public consultation. Last year, as you may be aware, we also introduced and enacted the Stablecoin Ordinance that establishes a licensing regime for fiat-referenced stablecoin issuers.

One fundamental principle that applies in these innovative initiatives is ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"", with clear and transparent rules on capital requirements, fit and properness for management personnel, and the segregation treatment of client and firm money. The aim is to enable the healthy and responsible development of the digital asset sector, with solid regulation and a robust ecosystem. The Policy Statement on the Responsible Application of AI in the Financial Market that the HKSAR Government issued in October 2024 carries the same spirit. In the same vein, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched two cohorts of the Generative AI Sandbox in August 2024 and April last year, providing a risk-managed framework for banks to test AI-use cases in a responsible manner.

Again, financial stability is at the core of financial market development and innovation. With the impressive list of speakers today, I am sure we shall all benefit from their insights and wisdom. I wish the event every success and, with a warm welcome, I wish guests travelling from afar will have a good time in Hong Kong. Enjoy our vibrant city. Thank you."

Customs officers intercepted a 55-year-old female passenger on the abovementioned date at the Departure Hall at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point for Customs clearance. Upon examination, the batch of pharmaceutical injections was found around her waist and legs and covered underneath her clothes.

Customs welcomes the sentences. The custodial sentences have imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflect the seriousness of the offences.

Under the IEO, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction. Any person who exports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid export licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Primary Healthcare Commission launches Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme to provide hepatitis B screening and treatment services for higher-risk group,2026-01-26 17:12,2026-01-26 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600288.htm,"  The Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) under the Health Bureau announced today (January 26) that the Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme will be launched on February 7 to identify people with chronic hepatitis B in the community at an early stage and provide long-term follow-up services, with a view to reducing their risk of having cirrhosis, liver cancer and other serious complications. Starting from that day, eligible persons may enrol in the Scheme at District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) to receive a hepatitis B risk assessment, screening and long-term management.

  The Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme is one of the key primary healthcare initiatives put forward by the Chief Executive in his 2025 Policy Address. Making reference to the service model of the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme), the Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme subsidises eligible persons to receive chronic hepatitis B screenings and treatment, as well as liver cancer screenings, in the private healthcare sector through strategic purchasing and a co-payment model.

  The Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme targets a higher-risk group. Hong Kong residents born in or before 1988 (the introduction year of the universal childhood hepatitis B immunisation programme) with no known medical history of chronic hepatitis B nor related symptoms, while having family members (including parents, siblings and offspring) or sexual partners who contracted chronic hepatitis B being eligible to participate. They have to first register as DHC members and agree to join eHealth.

  DHC staff will arrange eligible participants to undergo a free hepatitis B surface antigen rapid diagnostic test (RDT) at DHCs, and pair them with a family doctor of their own choice. Participants with positive RDT results will be subsidised by the Government to receive further blood tests at the clinic of their chosen and paired family doctor under a co-payment model to confirm whether they are infected with the hepatitis B virus. Under the general service workflow, if the result of the participant's first blood test is positive, the family doctor will arrange a second blood test for the participant six months later to confirm the diagnosis. During the process, family doctors will promptly assess and diagnose whether a participant has chronic hepatitis B based on the participant's laboratory results and clinical conditions, with a view to providing appropriate treatment and management. During the screening phase, participants are only required to pay a co-payment fee of $180, while the Government will subsidise family doctors for up to two consultations at a total consultation fee of $136. Participants who are not diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B after a screening can continue to receive hepatitis B-related health counselling and education at DHCs to establish healthy lifestyles (see Annex for details of the screening process).

  Participants who are diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B will enter the treatment phase, with arrangements the same as those of the CDCC Pilot Scheme. Participants are entitled to a maximum of four subsidised consultations per year for follow-up service, and they have to pay a co-payment fee determined by the family doctor (Note) for each consultation. The Government has recommended a co-payment fee of $150 per consultation. The Government will provide a subsidy of $166 to family doctors for each consultation. The same basic-tier drug list of the CDCC Pilot Scheme, which includes antiviral medicines for hepatitis B treatment, will also be adopted in the treatment phase. Participants prescribed with those drugs will not be required to pay for medication. In addition, family doctors can arrange appropriate laboratory testing services for participants with clinical needs. The list of laboratory tests and related co-payment fees are the same as those under the CDCC Pilot Scheme.

  To encourage family doctors to provide whole-person and continuous care to members of the public, family doctors can offer management for chronic diseases such as prediabetes, diabetes mellitus, hypertension or hyperlipidaemia in the same consultation for participants who have also enrolled in the CDCC Pilot Scheme. Participants are only required to pay a co-payment fee for one consultation. The consultation quotas will also be calculated in a consolidated manner. The higher number of subsidised consultation quotas for the CDCC Pilot Scheme or the Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme shall prevail. As the concurrent management of the ""three highs"" and chronic hepatitis B requires a more detailed and comprehensive assessment and diagnosis, the Government will provide an additional fixed annual subsidy of $300 per participant to the family doctor if the family doctor has provided concurrent management for chronic hepatitis B and any of the ""three highs"" chronic diseases for the same participant in at least two consultation sessions within a calendar year (January 1 to December 31).

  To address the healthcare needs of the underprivileged group, if the eligible persons are recipients of the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme, recipients of the Old Age Living Allowance aged 75 or above, or holders of valid medical fee waiver certificates, DHCs will arrange for them to receive the same chronic hepatitis B screening and treatment services at 18 designated Family Medicine Clinics of the Hospital Authority. Participants may be granted a full or partial medical fee waiver based on their relevant eligibility when receiving the services.

  Members of the public may visit the CDCC Pilot Scheme's thematic website for more details of the Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme.

Note: The co-payment fee for medical consultations set by family doctors under the Hepatitis B Co-care Scheme must be consistent with the co-payment level set under the CDCC Pilot Scheme."

「乙肝共治計劃」是行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中提出的其中一項重點基層醫療措施。計劃參照「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」）的服務模式，以策略採購及共付模式，資助合資格人士在私營醫療市場接受慢性乙型肝炎篩查和治療，以及肝癌篩查。

「乙肝共治計劃」針對較高風險群組，合資格參加者為在一九八八年（初生嬰兒普及乙型肝炎疫苗注射計劃之推出年份）或以前出生、其家庭成員（包括父母、兄弟姐妹和子女）或性伴侶為慢性乙型肝炎患者，以及沒有確診患有慢性乙型肝炎且無相關病徵的香港居民。參加者須先登記成為康健中心會員並同意加入醫健通。

康健中心職員會安排合資格參加者在康健中心接受免費乙型肝炎表面抗原快速測試，並為他們配對自選家庭醫生。快速測試結果呈陽性的參加者會獲政府資助，到所配對的自選家庭醫生診所以共付模式接受進一步抽血化驗，以確認是否感染乙型肝炎病毒。在一般服務流程上，若參加者首次抽血化驗結果呈陽性，家庭醫生會於六個月後安排參加者接受第二次抽血化驗，以進一步確認。家庭醫生會在過程中根據參加者的化驗結果及臨床情況，適時診斷參加者是否為慢性乙型肝炎患者，從而提供適切的治療和管理。在篩查階段，參加者只須支付180元的共付額，而政府會資助家庭醫生最多兩次診症合共136元診症費。若參加者經篩查後確認沒有患上慢性乙型肝炎，可繼續在康健中心接受乙型肝炎相關的健康輔導及教育，建立健康生活模式（篩查過程詳見附件）。

為鼓勵家庭醫生向市民提供全人和連貫的護理，如參加者同時為「慢病共治計劃」參加者，家庭醫生可在同一次診症中同時處理他們的血糖偏高、糖尿病、血壓高或高血脂等慢性疾病，參加者只需支付一次的診症共付額。至於診症配額亦會整合計算，並以「慢病共治計劃」或「乙肝共治計劃」的較高資助診症額為準。由於一併治理「三高」和慢性乙型肝炎需要更加詳細和整全的考慮及診斷，如家庭醫生於一年內（一月一日至十二月三十一日），為同一位參加者在至少兩次診症中，同時治理慢性乙型肝炎及任何「三高」慢性疾病，政府將按每位參加者額外向家庭醫生每年定額資助300元。

為照顧弱勢社群的健康服務需要，如合資格參加者為綜合社會保障援助計劃受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受惠人，或持有有效醫療費用減免證明書，康健中心會安排他們到18間選定的醫院管理局家庭醫學診所，接受相同的慢性乙型肝炎篩查和治療服務，參加者在接受服務時可按相關資格獲全數豁免或部分減免費用。

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2026-01-26 17:00,2026-01-26 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600431.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 26) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From January 18 to 24, the CHP recorded one community-acquired LD case, involving a 77-year old female patient living in Wan Chai District who had underlying illnesses.

​​The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that this is a sporadic case. No epidemiological linkages have been established between thiscommunity-acquired case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

  As of January 24, five LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2025 and 2024, there were 167 and 135 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpool spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or ships.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, water fountains, humidifiers and home respiratory devices that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) or less and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.


​The public may visit the CHP'sLD page, theCode of Practice for Prevention of LDand theHousekeeping Guidelines for Cold and Hot Water Systems for Building Managementof the Prevention of LD Committee, and the CHP'srisk-based strategyfor prevention and control of LD.

Additionally, as smokers and alcoholics are more susceptible to LD, the Government urgesmembers of the public to quit smoking and avoid drinking. Members of the public may call the DH Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline at 1833 183, which is answered by registered nurses who provide professional counselling and referral to a wide range of free smoking cessation services. The public may also visit the smoking cessation thematic website (www.livetobaccofree.hk) for more information on smoking cessation. The DH has also launched the Pilot Alcohol Cessation Counselling Service, which provides free counselling to people identified as having probable alcohol dependence, through a subvented non-governmental organisation, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals (TWGHs). Information on the service has been uploaded to the DH'sChange for Healthwebsite. Eligible persons who are interested can call the enquiry hotline of the TWGHs (2884 9876)."

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2026-01-26 17:00,2026-01-26 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600430.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十六日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在一月十八日至二十四日期間，中心錄得一宗社區感染退伍軍人病個案，涉及一名有長期病患的77歲女病人，她居於灣仔區。

​中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至一月二十四日，今年錄得五宗退伍軍人病案。本港於二○二五年及二○二四年分別錄得167及135宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池、加濕器和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：

Speech by FS at Asian Financial Forum Keynote Luncheon (English only) (with photo/video),2026-01-26 16:08,2026-01-26 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600504.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Asian Financial Forum Keynote Luncheon today (January 26):

Dr Barroso (Former President of the European Commission and former Prime Minister of Portugal, Dr José Manuel Barroso), Fred (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Professor Frederick Ma), your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is my honour to welcome you to this year's Asian Financial Forum Luncheon.

  Let me begin by extending a very warm welcome to Dr José Manuel Barroso, who will deliver today's keynote address. Dr Barroso served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 2002 to 2004 and as President of the European Commission from 2004 to 2014. His presence here is particularly timely. At a moment when Europe stands at a geopolitical crossroads - navigating rising tensions and a shifting transatlantic dynamic - we look forward to Dr Barroso's insights on developments not only across Europe, but also for the world at large.

Reflections from Davos

  Ladies and gentlemen, we are living through an era of profound complexity and transformation. Having just returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, I can attest to the deep sense of reflection shared among global leaders. While opinions may diverge on many fronts, there is a striking convergence on one point: the world is becoming increasingly unfamiliar. Longstanding allies stand at the risk of becoming adversaries. The very principles that underpin the international order for eight decades - sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the authority of the United Nations - are being openly denounced.

  Some speak of the end of the rules-based international order. Others push for Europe's independence. Yet the underlying message is clear: countries are reassessing their economic and security relationships, seeking to build strategic resilience, and adapting to a more fragmented global environment.

  A key theme emerging from Davos was diversification - across trade, supply chains and finance. Faced with growing uncertainty, economies are striving to forge new partnerships and gain access to alternative markets.

China's opportunities

  It is against this backdrop that China's role becomes particularly relevant.

  In a world marked by volatility and unilateralism, China offers a high degree of stability and predictability. At the World Economic Forum, Vice Premier He Lifeng reaffirmed China's unwavering commitment to openness and co-operation, emphasising that reform and opening-up remain fundamental pillars of national policy. He also reiterated China's support for free trade, multilateralism, and mutual respect.

  These are not aspirational statements. They signal policy continuity and consistency, qualities that are vital for global investors and businesses.

  Looking ahead, China's development will continue to create substantial opportunities for the world. Two areas are particularly notable.

  First, China's medium-to-long-term growth trajectory remains solid and resilient. Its economy met its 5 per cent growth target last year, averaging 5.4 per cent during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, and accounted for around 30 per cent of global GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth.

  The Central authorities' focus is now on stimulating domestic demand as a key driver of sustained growth. As the middle-income population expands, so too does the appetite for high-quality goods and services. It has made clear that foreign products and services are welcome. And in fact, China has been organising the China International Import Expo since 2018. This is creating considerable opportunities for international businesses.

  Second, China is placing strategic emphasis on technological advancement. In the recommendations for the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan, science and technological self-reliance are at the forefront of national development. China's growing capabilities in AI, robotics and biotechnology have already captured global attention - and this momentum will only accelerate. With a strong focus on integrating technological and industrial innovation, China is determined to lead in critical technologies that will define the future global economy.

  Together, with a growing Southeast Asia, this part of the world is becoming as a vital source of growth, innovation, as well as business and investment opportunities.

Hong Kong's value proposition

  This naturally brings us to Hong Kong. What is our role in this evolving landscape? And what is our value proposition?

  We believe Hong Kong's significance will only grow. Hong Kong is very much the gateway for the world to access China's and Asia's opportunities, and vice versa. We have convenient and often priority access to the Mainland market, while maintaining all the characteristics that define us as an international metropolitan city: the common law system; an independent judiciary; free flow of capital, goods, people and information; a low and simple tax system; a currency pegged to the US dollar; and more. As a free port, Hong Kong remains steadfastly committed to free trade and supportive of a rules-based multilateral trading system.

  In a world where economies are reconfiguring value chains and seeking more resilient, diversified partnerships, Hong Kong stands out as a reliable, trusted, resourceful and well-positioned partner, bridging the Mainland and the world.

  In the realms of finance, allow me to highlight two key specific areas that may be of interest to you.

Two-way funding platform

  First, our role as the premier two-way international fundraising platform. Our stock market had a strong performance in the past two years, and in fact topped the IPO (initial public offering) league table last year. It continues to attract significant international interest, with more than 400 companies currently in the IPO pipeline. Many of them are Mainland enterprises engaged in frontier technologies and advanced manufacturing. These companies are choosing Hong Kong to fund and support their global expansion and supply chain diversification. A notable example is CATL, which launched the world's then largest IPO in Hong Kong last year to fund its expansion into Hungary.

  In other words, Hong Kong serves as a gateway for global investors to access China's innovation-driven opportunities.

  At the same time, we are working to bring more global companies to the Hong Kong market. For those exploring listing venues beyond the US (United States), Hong Kong offers a compelling choice. Our secondary market is deep, liquid and international. Statistics show that approximately 50 per cent of capital in our stock market comes from global institutional investors, 25 per cent from Mainland Southbound flows, and another 25 per cent from local institutional and retail investors. That is to say, by listing in Hong Kong, companies can gain access to both international and Mainland capital. 

  Hong Kong is indeed emerging as a listing hub for companies from across the globe. To drive this forward, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has since 2023 expanded its list of recognised exchanges for dual primary or secondary listings - now covering 20 markets, including those in the Middle East and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). In fact, recently, issuers from Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Singapore, and the UAE (United Arab Emirates), have chosen Hong Kong as their platform to access global capital.

  We are also strengthening connectivity with other markets through mutual listing of ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that invest in each other's market, providing investors with more choices. For example, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia each have listed two ETFs tracking each other's markets. We are also working with Korea on similar arrangements.

Offshore RMB business hub

  The second area is our position as the world's leading offshore Renminbi (RMB) business hub. This is particularly relevant today, as the use of RMB continues to grow globally - driven by two key forces.

  First, the reconfiguration of global supply chains. As more Chinese enterprises expand overseas and deepen co-operation with international partners, the cross-border use of the RMB is naturally increasing.

  Second, the growing demand for diversification. RMB assets tend to have a lower correlation with traditional global markets, making them an appealing option for investors seeking to manage risk.

  Besides, China currently accounts for around 13 per cent of global trade, but the RMB currently represents just 3 to 4 per cent of global payments via SWIFT. The potential for further expansion is significant, especially at a time when the US dollar is being weaponised.

  Hong Kong is expanding its offerings in RMB-denominated investment and risk management products, strengthening the related infrastructure, and enhancing its market liquidity. These efforts are creating more investment channels for international holders of the currency, and supporting the prudent internationlisation of the RMB.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by reflecting on Hong Kong's enduring role in a rapidly changing world.

  Hong Kong has always thrived as an open, transparent and outward-looking financial and commercial hub. We believe that prosperity is built not by erecting barriers, but by building bridges - bridges that connect capital with innovation, East with West, and ideas with impact.

  At a time of global fragmentation, Hong Kong will continue to remain open for business, welcome partners from around the world to join us in shaping the future of Asia - and the world at large.

  Thank you very much."
​運輸及物流局局長出席「慶祝高鐵直達站點再創新里程」儀式致辭（只有中文）,2026-01-26 16:05,2026-01-26 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600514.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（一月二十六日）出席「慶祝高鐵直達站點再創新里程」儀式的致辭全文：

Jeny行政總裁（港鐵公司行政總裁楊美珍）、各位議員、各位嘉賓、各位傳媒朋友、各位香港市民：

很高興應港鐵公司邀請出席今日的活動，和大家一起見證高鐵西九龍站接駁內地高鐵網絡的直達站點再次突破，正如剛才Jeny所說，會增至110個。Jeny早前跟我預告即將突破100個站點，殊不知來到這個盛會，港鐵已經再為我們帶來好消息──不只100，而是110。我們熱切期待好消息陸續有來。

這不單象徵着公共交通運輸的新里程碑，更印證和體現香港和內地的密切聯繫。大家都知道香港有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，而西九龍站接駁內地龐大的高鐵網絡，帶領香港市民和遊客到內地走遍大江南北，正正體現香港作為「超級聯繫人」的角色。

接下來，我們要更加努力。正如剛才司儀和Jeny提到，西九龍站開通後服務一直不斷改善，除了直達站點有所增加，如果大家在趕車時有留意周邊的配套設施，在入閘處、零售餐飲處甚至是底層候車處，都進行了很多硬件和軟件上的提升，充分體現以人為本、貼心、便民的安排。

在此我再次感謝國鐵集團（中國國家鐵路集團有限公司）、廣鐵集團（中國鐵路廣州局集團有限公司）和港鐵公司，三方大力將西九龍站接駁內地的高鐵服務精益求精，不斷推出多元化的旅遊路線，亦在較近的站點提供「靈活行」的產品。

除了我上星期出席「粵車南下」活動時提到的港珠澳大橋外，高鐵香港段亦同樣已開通七年，在往來人次方面，已經雙雙累計超過一億。在這個「雙破億」的里程碑下，我們會進一步優化服務，為大家帶來更多不同的旅遊產品和出行方便。除了剛才提到的更多站點，亦會多一些動臥列車，而沿線站點亦更多元化，除了一些比較近、有美食的地方，還有文化古都等旅遊城市。和大家分享一個小秘密，我和團隊經常都會乘坐高鐵到內地訪問和開會，包括即日或隔日往返；若工餘時間有機會，我都很希望和朋友、家人乘坐高鐵，享受這些較便利的旅遊產品。今日雖然沒有機會和首發團一起出發，但我期望下次有機會和大家一同感受這些富有「獲得感」的旅遊產品。

說到精益求精，我們銳意與港鐵公司和其他香港企業，聯同內地、深圳和有關當局，努力構建「軌道上的大灣區」。我們正如火如荼地籌備和興建兩條跨境鐵路──北環線支線和港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海）。除了硬體的推進，我們亦期望盡快公布新的鐵路標準。這套新鐵路標準正正可以融合和利用國家在興建高鐵時所累積的經驗，以及所達到的領先建造水平，將這套領先的鐵路標準應用於香港。我們的願景是為大灣區和國家興建鐵路時，構建和打造一套與時並進的新標準，務求做到提速、提效和減低成本。

最後，希望港鐵公司高鐵網路服務於未來新一年的乘客量節節上升。我知道高鐵團隊的同事雖然辛苦，但戰意高昂，團隊精神很好，會為我們在新一年做到「快馬加鞭迎丙午，馬力全開接萬客」。多謝大家。"

財經事務及庫務局局長於第十九屆亞洲金融論壇會見傳媒談話內容,2026-01-26 15:31,2026-01-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600467.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（一月二十六日）上午出席第十九屆亞洲金融論壇期間會見傳媒的談話內容：

財經事務及庫務局局長：各位早晨。今日最令人振奮的一定是我們財經事務及庫務局與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，強強聯手一起促進香港與上海作為國際金融中心及黃金市場的協同發展。這個也是香港建設國際黃金交易中心的重要一步。

我們與上海黃金交易所的合作主要有兩方面：一是建立高層次協作治理架構。我們已經成立了由特區（香港特別行政區）政府全資擁有的「香港貴金屬中央結算系統有限公司」，簡稱「港金結算公司」。「港金結算公司」將由我擔任董事會主席，上海黃金交易所代表出任副主席。上海黃金交易所代表將具體參與香港黃金中央清算系統準備、規則制定和機構認可等事宜，就系統建設及風險管理等提供專業意見。滬港將攜手推動結算平台高效建設，並與國際接軌。

第二方面的合作是開拓實物基礎設施協同，以及市場互聯互通新路徑。我們會和上海黃金交易所一起探索依託它們的實物倉儲管理體系，為香港本地及國際市場參與者提供實金存儲服務，也會積極推進兩地黃金市場更大程度的互聯互通，目標是構建真正一體化、高效開放的黃金生態圈。

建設可持續的黃金價值鏈，正如我剛才發言所提及，是包含多個元素——倉儲、精煉、交易、交割、清算，以及相關金融產品。今日我們也宣布了好幾項相關的新措施：

（一） 機場管理局已立項擴展在機場的倉儲設施，規模將達至千噸級別，兼顧本地儲存、交割和過境轉運需求。
（二） 去年底，我們與深圳市地方金融管理局就港深兩地開展加工貿易合作簽署了合作備忘錄，我們歡迎香港金商與深圳具備相關資格的精煉企業開展實質合作。
（三） 剛才提到的香港黃金中央清算系統計劃今年內便會試營運。
（四） 政府計劃今年上半年提交立法建議，把貴金屬納入有關基金及單一家族辦公室的優惠稅制合資格投資範圍。
（五） 成功的黃金生態圈發展一定要有巿場參與。我很高興，本星期，香港會有新的黃金基金上市。這個黃金基金最大的特色是透過本地的黃金基礎設施，進行所有實金交易及黃金儲存，亦會提供在銀行兌換實物黃金的選項。發行人還計劃推出非上巿類別，探索透過持牌數字資產交易平台分銷，連接傳統與數碼金融。
（六） 今日下午的黃金專題環節上，市場機構將公布香港可持續黃金治理框架和標準體系建設展望，務求推動合乎道德及可持續的採購、環境保護及長期責任標準。

今屆論壇另一個很值得期待的是明日舉行的全球產業峰會。亞洲金融論壇每年都在一年伊始的時候，匯聚世界各地的政府、金融和商界領袖與我們就金融發展與前景作深度討論，共同發掘新機遇。我們不單只講，更着重將其化為具體成果。所以環球投資項目對接（Deal-making）就是論壇的特色。今屆，我們更進一步地去推進金融賦能產業，明日我們首度舉辦全球產業峰會，參與的既有「走出去」的內地企業，亦有「引進來」的國際企業，峰會還會就多個近年火熱的高增長產業作討論，包括生物醫學、新能源、人工智能、機械人、高增長消費品等。

大家都看到今日會場內是人頭湧湧的，來自60多個國家的3 600多位參加者都來了，反映他們對香港的前景充滿興趣和信心。同樣對香港有長遠信心的還有遷冊來港的跨國企業。公司遷冊制度去年五月生效，市場反應十分正面。至今，我們收到超過三十宗申請。

而正正在今早，「安盛（AXA）中國有限公司」及其全資附屬公司「安盛保險（百慕達）有限公司」已正式獲公司註冊處簽發遷冊證明書，成功落戶本港，令過去八個月內累積獲批的申請增加至合共十四宗。未來，我們會繼續與公司註冊處及相關金融監管機構緊密合作，為有意遷冊來港的企業提供全面支援，吸引更多跨國企業落戶香港。

接下來，我會回答各位的提問。

記者：局長，剛剛你提到那個貴金屬交易所，尤其是黃金有儲存交割的這個。我想問一下內地的投資者怎麼可以參與？有沒有考慮去放開這個門檻給他們？

財經事務及庫務局局長：現在我們的計劃是先把香港的清算系統建立起來。正如剛才所說的，這個清算系統有兩個特點，第一，我們跟上海黃金交易所深度合作，包括董事會內，有我也有他們作為成員。

第二，我們會在實體交割，也就是倉儲這一方面，跟上海黃金交易所深度合作。下一步，當然我們也希望通過整個建設黃金生態圈的過程，能夠進一步在互聯互通有所突破。但目前為止，我們聚焦的就是黃金中央清算系統，並做好我們跟上海黃金交易所的具體合作。

記者：現在的黃金清算系統將如何與本地的黃金交易所合作？未來會否在黃金代幣化上有所嘗試？下一個問題是關於IPO（首次公開招股）的。近期市場有傳言說內地將會收緊企業來香港進行IPO，會增加限制。你覺得會否影響內地企業來香港上市這個趨勢呢？

財經事務及庫務局局長：剛才我也介紹了，我們在黃金這個領域，今天我們宣布的主要就是關於我們已經成立公司，由特區政府全資擁有，將建立黃金中央清算系統，同時跟上海黃金交易所深度合作，包括董事會的組成，也包括在倉儲服務體系方面的合作。

第二，我們在這過程內，當然也歡迎本地的、海外的黃金（市場）參與者來參與這個系統。具體上，我們現在就是在一些規則，還有政策上，會在董事會會議上定下來。具體下一個工作就是吸納各方面合資格的參與商，參與我們這個黃金市場。

第二個問題，香港目前為止，今年第一個月還未結束，我們已經迎來大概11隻新股上市，再加上350多隻正在排隊的企業（新股）來香港上市，熱情還是相當高。一直以來，我們也跟內地監管機構緊密溝通，確保香港能夠持續作為一個內地區域的，還有全球企業融資的最佳平台。

記者：結算公司（「香港貴金屬中央結算系統有限公司」）set up後會由你出任主席，那其他board members是誰？今年預計試行後，下一步計劃是怎樣？你們會怎樣吸引國際參與者參與clearing服務？

財經事務及庫務局局長：由政府全資擁有的「港金結算公司」，董事會包括我和上海黃金交易所的代表，其他代表基本上是主要銀行的代表，因為現時銀行是全球黃金市場交易和結算的主要參與者。參與的不單有本地銀行，海內外銀行亦在內，所以你看到國際性在我們整個黃金市場的構造和價值鏈方面是相當重要的，這是第一。

第二方面，你剛才問未來我們有甚麼工作要做，其實你看我們這次的整體安排，在全球大變局下，政府的信用是越來越重要的。在「一國兩制」下，國家的支持給予我們很充分的信心去把我們的黃金市場連結起來。下一步，有了結算公司後，我們在產品方面會有更多的推出，例如剛才我所說的港交所（香港交易所）黃金期貨，也包括剛才我所介紹的那個黃金基金。我們希望將整個價值鏈，由倉儲開始，包括結算和產品，都能夠豐富起來。

記者：現時跟深圳那邊一些合資格的企業在供應鏈方面的合作，會不會有一個時間表？例如上半年會在哪一個程度合作？下半年會到甚麼程度？還有粵港澳大灣區其他城市有沒有合作機會？甚至跟澳門那邊，未來會否也有機會探索這方面的合作呢？

財經事務及庫務局局長：雖然今早我們的合作協議是跟上海黃金交易所簽署，但即使是這樣，其實我們整個市場是有區域性，也有國際性的，我們希望例如大灣區（粵港澳大灣區）相關城市，在倉儲或在其他方面都能夠跟我們有所合作，又例如我們已經跟深圳市金融局（深圳市地方金融管理局）簽了協議，就是一些海外的或是香港的黃金精煉商，如果有興趣想用好深圳方面的精煉服務，可以通過香港依規合法地將黃金放進去，然後做精煉後拿出來，這些都是我們希望用好不單是跟上海合作，也包括在灣區的優勢，令我們這個黃金市場能夠結合起來。

記者：剛剛你提到跟國際間的金所有些合作，可否披露一下名字？有哪些在洽談當中？另外，人行副行長（中國人民銀行副行長鄒瀾）提到全力推進人民幣國債期貨，有沒有時間表？因為都提過數次。另外，遷冊方面目前收到超過三十宗申請，是哪一類型的公司？主要是哪些sector？

財經事務及庫務局局長：或許我先談遷冊，我們去年五月通過了法例和這套遷冊機制後，市場反應是很好的，包括主要好幾間的保險公司，也包括我剛才所說最新今早的AXA，我們亦看到很多金融機構其實都已經着手準備，甚至已經遷冊過來。

第二方面，不只是金融機構，我們也看到一些控股公司，或者其他經濟活動類型的公司，都在想這一方面的安排，甚至已經申請或獲批准，所以我剛才說有這個數量的（遷冊證明書）已經批出來。因此，你看到在大變局下，香港作為一個安全港，的確是能給予海外企業很十足的信心，將他們的業務搬過來。

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由一月二十三日中午截至今日（一月二十六日）中午，食安中心已在過去三日（包括過去的星期六及星期日）對304個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對150個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

由二○二三年八月二十四日起至今日中午，食安中心及漁護署分別檢測了共199 106個日本進口食物樣本（包括127 898個水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽樣本）及共44 020個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。"
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2026-01-26 15:30,2026-01-26 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600489.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on January 23 to noon today (January 26), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 304 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website
(www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 199 106 samples of food imported from Japan (including 127 898 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 44 020 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."
環境及生態局局長在立法會環境事務委員會政策簡報會開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-26 15:20,2026-01-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600485.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（一月二十六日）在立法會環境事務委員會政策簡報會的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

大家好。首先再次祝賀各位當選新一屆立法會議員。

環境及生態局轄下有兩個科，包括環境科及食物科，負責制定和統籌有關涵蓋氣候變化、環境保護、自然生態保育、綠色運輸、能源、改善環境衞生、保障食物安全、推進食物產業發展、促進漁農業可持續發展，以及推廣寵物友善等工作，相當廣闊。環境科的工作核心在於制訂與推行全面的環境保護政策，致力保護生物多樣性，實現碳中和目標，並推動香港成為綠色科技示範基地，使香港成為一個低碳綠色宜居的城市，邁向高質量和可持續發展。

今屆政府，我們的空氣質量不斷改善，是回歸後最好的；維港回復有多種珊瑚；維港沿岸水質和氣味大幅改善；我們設立了紅花嶺郊野公園；面積最大的北大嶼海岸公園；以及結合濕地保育、農耕作業與自然教育於一身的塱原自然生態公園，大鵬灣亦都獲選為全國美麗海灣的優秀案例。

我們扭轉了香港廢物棄置量長期上升的趨勢，廢物棄置量已經連續三年下降，回收率開始上升，第一個轉廢為能設施亦已開始投入運作。大家都關心的雙碳目標方面，香港的碳排放量持續下降，人均碳排放量只是美國的約四分之一；電動車數目三年來翻了兩翻，是二○二一年的四倍；一間電動車電池的回收設施也在建設中。為了抓住發展綠色能源的機遇，我們也制定了《香港氫能發展策略》。

放眼未來，二十屆四中全會通過的「十五五」規劃建議提出要加快經濟社會發展全面綠色轉型，建設美麗中國。綠色發展是中國式現代化的鮮明底色。要牢固樹立和踐行「綠水青山就是金山銀山」的理念，以碳達峰、碳中和為導引，協同推進降碳、減污、擴綠、增長，築牢生態安全屏障，增強綠色發展動能。

對接「十五五」規劃是我們未來的大方向和目標，這是我們的共同挑戰，但亦會帶來新機遇，邁步向前需要社會各界齊心協力。我們將繼續與各位委員共同為建設更美好的香港而努力。

接下來，我請署理常任秘書長（環境）郭慧玲女士用投影片向各位詳細報告環境科的工作、最新進展與未來重點。之後我們樂意和各位就環境科的工作交流意見。謝謝。"
