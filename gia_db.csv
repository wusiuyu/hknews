徐曉主席（中華全國青年聯合會主席）、蔡曜陽主席（香港青年聯會主席）、各位青聯會董、各位嘉賓、各位青年朋友：

大家好！我很高興以視頻形式參與香港青年聯會（青聯）的第三十三屆會慶及會董會就職典禮，並與大家一同慶祝國慶七十六周年。

青聯自一九九二年成立至今，始終秉持愛國愛港的宗旨，廣泛團結各界青年，為國家和香港培育優秀人才，是維護香港繁榮穩定的重要力量。

青聯多年來積極響應政府的青年發展工作，在青年交流與實習、創業支援與孵化、青年宿舍、共享空間等領域貢獻良多。青聯歷任會董會和成員的努力，展現了你們作為青年引路人的責任與擔當，我肯定你們的工作。

青年是社會中朝氣蓬勃、創新拼搏的新一代。特區政府一直全力啓發青年的潛能，扶持他們的成長，讓他們擁抱自己開創的未來。我在今個月發表的第四份《施政報告》，以「深化改革 心繫民生 發揮優勢 同創未來」為主題，提出一系列突破新局面的策略部署。

我在《施政報告》指出，我們將推出青年人才培養計劃，為香港青年提供更多參與國際組織實習和國際會議的機會，更好裝備香港青年，擴闊他們的國際視野及建立大局觀。

青年創意無限，勇於突破自我。我們會擴大大灣區香港青年創新創業基地聯盟的成員機構數目，民政及青年事務局亦會持續推展大灣區青年創業資助計劃和創新創業基地體驗資助計劃，為創業青年提供更全面的支援，協助他們拓展網絡，提升競爭力。

特區政府會繼續積極透過多元化的措施，為青年提供更到位的支援，鼓勵他們實現全人發展、盡展所能。我們會全力創造一個充滿機會、成就夢想的社會環境，協助青年把握香港內聯外通的優勢，實現抱負、一展所長。

青年發展工作需要持續耕耘、久久為功，社會各界的支持至關重要。我相信青聯未來會繼續與政府全力合作，為青年描繪更璀璨的未來。我期待與各位一同攜手並肩，培育香港青年成為愛國愛港、具備世界視野、有抱負和具正向思維的新一代，為實現中華民族偉大復興作出貢獻。

最後，我祝賀國家富強昌盛，並祝願青聯會務蒸蒸日上，各位工作順利。多謝大家。"

Under the theme ""Connecting the World into the Future"", the Summit has gathered officials responsible for youth policies from various regions, alongside experts and leaders of different sectors as guest speakers. The Summit attracted over 3000 young people registered to participate, including around 600 of them from the Chinese Mainland and 33 overseas countries such as the United States, Malaysia, Laos, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, which enabled them to exchange views and engage in mutual learning on issues of concern to young people.

Our Youth Development Blueprint, released in late 2022, outlines our guiding principles for advancing youth development, as well as charting a clear pathway for stakeholders everywhere. Our vision is to nurture a new generation of youth equipped with a global perspective, a positive thinking mindset, and an affection for our city and our country. Since the release of the Blueprint, more than 250 concrete actions and measures have been put forward to providing young people with wide-ranging opportunities and support.""

Mr Chan thanked all the speakers who shared their experiences and visionary ideas, inspiring the participants from around the world to think about how they can foster stronger connections across boundaries and cultures to help and learn from each other to build a better future together.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-27 17:30,2025-09-27 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700665.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 27), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 23 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

三地青少年成員以訪談和短片形式分享過往一年論壇活動的所見所感，包括在不同知名企業和政府機構等暑期實習的體驗。成員分別就不同青年相關議題，包括公共參與、推廣中國文化、網絡倫理與公民責任、說好粵港澳大灣區故事和青年社會責任等匯報，並聽取嘉賓的評語。新舊學員之後進行團建活動，透過遊戲增進彼此認識，為來年合作學習打好基礎。

保安局局長鄧炳強作總結發言時表示，過去一年「領袖論壇」成員亦取得不少成果，包括四人代表香港青年出席在北京舉行的抗日戰爭勝利80周年閱兵、一人作為中國香港青年代表赴秘魯參加2024年亞太經濟合作組織「未來之聲」計劃、七人榮獲只有20個香港地區名額的「中國大學生自強之星」等。另外，今年暑假有42位成員到知名企業或者機構實習，實習地點遍布北京、上海、南京、深圳、珠海、香港、澳門等地；亦有深圳大學10位同學來港到不同企業體驗培訓。

鄧炳強表示，為進一步強化大灣區合作的核心目標，保安局未來會派出五位政務主任，聯同五位來自深圳大學的教師，共同成為新一屆學員的輔導員，指導他們完成與大灣區合作領域有關的專題研究。他亦指部分「領袖論壇」學長正積極籌備成立學長會，期望將他們所學的社會責任感、協同合作力帶到更加多社會服務活動，成為能貢獻香港及國家的團體。

保安局於二○二二年十月成立「領袖論壇」，深化青年工作。翌年與深圳大學簽訂合作備忘錄，邀請該校同學參加「領袖論壇」的活動，去年更加入澳門保安部隊高等學校學員，進一步擴大「領袖論壇」的協作網絡，促進港深澳三地青年發展和文化交流。"

Youth members from Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Macao reflected on their experiences and learning outcomes over the past year and gave presentations on various research topics. They also outlined the development of the Leaders Forum for the coming year, along with its new members.

Addressing the audience, the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, said the Leaders Forum has organised nearly 30 diversified events over the past year, covering areas including patriotic education, national security, technology, culture and career exploration. As this year marks the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, the Leaders Forum also arranged for youth members to visit the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders in Nanjing, enabling them to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of safeguarding national sovereignty and security. Noting that he is glad to see that the Leaders Forum strives to further deepen regional co-operation, he said that apart from continuing to maintain close collaboration with Shenzhen University, the Leaders Forum also partnered with the Academy of Public Security Forces of Macao for the first time, with a view to jointly promoting interaction and exchanges among young people in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Macao.

Youth members from the three places shared their observations and reflections from the activities of the Leaders Forum in the past year through interviews and short videos, including their experiences gained from the summer internships at various renowned enterprises and government agencies. Youth members gave presentations on various youth-related research topics, including public engagement, promotion of Chinese culture, cyber ethics and civic responsibilities, telling good stories of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and social responsibilities of youth. The members received feedback from the guests. Old and new members then participated in team-building activities to know each other through games, laying a solid foundation for collaborative learning in the coming year.

Concluding the event, the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, highlighted the significant achievements of the members of the Leaders Forum last year. These included four members representing Hong Kong youth to attend the military parade in commemoration of the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War in Beijing; a member, as the youth representative of Hong Kong, China, taking part in the Voices of the Future programme organised by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Peru in 2024; and seven members being awarded the stars of self-improvement of Chinese college students, an award presented to only 20 students in Hong Kong. Mr Tang added that 42 members did summer internships in renowned enterprises or organisations in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hong Kong and Macao, and 10 students from Shenzhen University came to Hong Kong for training in different enterprises.

Mr Tang said that in order to strengthen the core objectives of co-operation in the GBA, the SB will assign five Administrative Officers, together with five teachers from Shenzhen University, to serve as mentors for the new cohort of members, guiding new members to complete thematic research projects related to GBA collaboration. He also said that the alumni of the Leaders Forum are actively preparing for the establishment of an alumni association, in the hope of bringing the sense of social responsibility and collaborative spirit they have learned to more social service activities, becoming a group that can contribute to Hong Kong and the country.

The SB established the Leaders Forum in October 2022 to deepen participation in youth work. In the following year, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Shenzhen University, and its students were invited to participate in the activities of the Leaders Forum. Last year, the Leaders Forum expanded its network by including youth members of the Academy of Public Security Forces of Macao, further promoting youth development and cultural exchanges among Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Macao."

民政及青年事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-09-27 16:01,2025-09-27 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700574.htm,"​以下是民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（九月二十七日）出席香港．青年發展高峰論壇上午環節後會見傳媒的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長︰大家好。民政及青年事務局（民青局）今日舉辦第二屆青年發展高峰論壇，論壇以「聯通世界跨越未來」為主題，是二○二五年「青年節@HK」的其中一項亮點活動。很高興今早政務司司長為我們主持了開幕環節，分享香港在青年發展上的工作方針和願景。今早的主題演講以「青年共創新力量」為主題。我們很高興可以邀請到來自國家、馬來西亞、沙特阿拉伯王國、老撾人民民主共和國、哈薩克斯坦共和國，以及聯合國教育、科學及文化組織，主管青年政策及推動青年發展的主要領導官員發表主題演講，分享青年人在推動社會發展中所擔當的重要角色，以及各地政府在促進青年發展方面的工作和政策。

今次論壇反應很熱烈，登記參加者人數超過3 000人，亦有約600位來自不同國家、城市和國家不同城市的青年來參加。這些青年朋友來自美國、馬來西亞、老撾、沙特阿拉伯、卡塔爾和國家不同城市。大家就青年關心的議題與本地青年交流和互相學習。下午還設有三場專題論壇，我們一共邀請了10多位來自不同地區的業界翹楚和社會領袖擔任演講嘉賓，他們會就科技創新、文化創意及迸發青年潛能等議題與青年分享和交流，當中更會有兩個奧運金牌運動員和大家分享。我希望參與今次論壇的青年朋友能夠把握這個跨地域的交流平台相互交流，豐富自己的體驗，並且認識香港的發展機遇，以自己所長，成為社會的參與者和貢獻者。

除了今日的論壇外，民青局亦特意為內地不同城市及海外參加者安排了一個為期三日的本地考察和交流活動，由昨日（九月二十六日）已開始，直至明日（九月二十八日）。我們會帶參加者參觀香港數碼港、香港科技園、大館、香港故宮文化博物館、海洋公園去探望熊貓、還有天壇大佛和一些青年人喜歡去的「蒲點」，亦會去一些充滿本土特色的地方，例如南豐紗廠，以增強他們對香港科技創新、文化藝術和古蹟保育等方面的認識。民青局「連青人網絡」幹事會成員和「YDC青年大使計劃」的參加者會成為交流大使，與來自內地及海外的青年朋友一同探索香港，促進互動交流，全方位推廣香港，向世界說好香港故事。

民青局作為負責青年工作的政策局，我們會繼續凝聚社會各界力量，攜手推動青年發展，亦會繼續透過舉辦論壇、各個青年內地交流和實習計劃、不同的青年活動，培養年輕人。剛才提到我們會繼續凝聚社會各界力量，在此我要特別感謝，能舉辦今次論壇，背後有很多機構、組織和參與不同青年工作的朋友。他們無論在提供資源、資金，以及工作上、組織上的協調，都給予我們大力支持。這讓人看到香港的青年朋友是非常優秀，而社會各界都願意攜手為青年朋友創造更多機會和發展平台。

​記者：局長，可否說一下今次颱風下關愛隊的工作？疏散了多少居民到不同的庇護中心呢？另外，第一期關愛隊服務已完結，第二期會開始。第一期關愛隊的績效何時會公布予公眾？第二期未來工作有甚麼展望呢？

民政及青年事務局局長：首先，我要感謝各地區的義工朋友、關愛隊成員和義工、區議員、地區「三會」成員，不少社區組織，甚至有些中資機構，他們都提供了很大協助，預防這個超強颱風和之後的工作。上星期開始，當我們知道這個颱風將會很猛烈時，政務司司長已經統籌了不同部門，超前部署做各項預備工作，包括出動關愛隊、區議員和「地區」三會成員到那些可能會受水浸影響的低窪地區，特別是一些偏遠的鄉村，呼籲市民做好防風準備，也提醒他們要及時疏散。

大澳有很多村民，有義工協助他們將傢俬及時升高，亦呼籲他們有需要時疏散到臨時庇護中心。臨時庇護中心一般是在八號風球之下才開放，但當時我們已提早在星期二（九月二十三日）早上八時開放，因為我們想方便居民在還沒大風大雨時，可以及早安全地到臨時庇護中心休息。同時，臨時庇護中心一般是在八號風球除下後便關閉，但當時考慮到天氣不穩定，我們將臨時庇護中心的開放時間延長直到三號風球除下，天氣穩定了才關閉。在這段時間我們總共開放了50個臨時庇護中心，有超過900個市民使用。為甚麼開50個中心呢？因為有些在水浸影響的低窪地區，我們希望方便居民如要疏散到臨時庇護中心時，可以鄰近他們。我們很感謝地區裏不同的學校借出校舍，也有教會組織借出教會作臨時庇護中心，當然不少得的是鄉事委員會，也借出了鄉事委員會的地方，亦動員了鄉事委員會村長、村民，一同協助進行疏散工作。

至於疏散了多少市民，數量也挺多。舉例說我們在沙頭角中心小學設立了臨時庇護中心，為甚麼我們會那裏設立？因為在小學的對面，一條馬路之隔有一間老人院位處低窪地區，曾經在颱風山竹和天鴿時遭受水浸，老人院的院友當時亦要緊急撤離。所以這次我們提早部署，也感謝學校提早借出學校，讓我們可以提早協助老人院疏散二十幾位長者。老人院的疏散不同一般疏散行動，因為老人家需要有自己的床，我們要協助拆卸床，關愛隊的隊員、鄉事會的村民和義工朋友，要逐張拆卸婆婆公公在老人院的床，將床送到臨時庇護中心再安裝。老人家在這所學校臨時中心住了兩日，然後我們再陪他們返回老人院，協助還原在老人院內的床。所以我們在這裏做了很多大型工作。

又例如在深井村，在星期三水位高的時候，我們透過民政處協調關愛隊，在暴風前，已經收集了一些村民資料，所以當我們呼籲他們疏散，那天早上水位很高時，我們已經不停聯絡那些村民。

我們亦感謝民安隊和消防員，因有些村民行動不太方便，有些是要推輪椅，甚至有些是要揹他們去到當時的學校。當時深井有一間學校借了地方來做臨時庇護中心，所以其實我們做了很多工作。

反而有些村這次疏散不多，因為我們在之前做了一些防水工作。舉例在大埔的美援新村，美援新村也是一個位於低窪的鄉村，曾經因水浸受到很嚴重的影響。當我們知道這個暴風來臨前，大埔區議員、關愛隊的成員和義工，大家知道會在星期二下午懸掛八號風球後，已在星期一下午買了一些建築材料和板，幫二十多戶居民造好臨時擋水板，工作至星期一晚上，我們很感謝他們的努力。最終村民告訴我們，這些臨時的設施發揮了作用，讓他們的家不受水浸影響，之後亦有發短訊多謝區議員和關愛隊的成員。所以在這次工作上，我們看到在社會上，大家都是群策群力，而在星期二和三，關愛隊和區議員一直提供消息，看到哪裏有塌樹就會馬上透過我們的網絡通知（民政事務）專員，聯絡相關部門及時清理。所以在八號風球後，大家看到我們很快便清理了一些阻路的塌樹。我們很感謝市民的支持和配合政府的工作，亦要多謝不同的機構、關愛隊、區議會，以及社區的力量，大家一起眾志成城，一起做好這次工作。

至於你問關愛隊第二期，其實關愛隊的第一期還未完結。當關愛隊的第一期完結之後，他們會按我們的要求，需要交一個工作報告，我們收齊和整理後，會讓公眾看到關愛隊過去一期的工作成果。而第二期關愛隊的工作，我們也希望能無縫與第一期交接，因為大家看到，無論是颱風或是之前在東區的炸彈發現事件，關愛隊和義工在社區都付出了很大力量。我們很希望第二期和第一期能夠無縫交接，不會影響社區的服務。"

Dorian (Founding Chairman of the Asian New Generation Creativity Design Association, Mr Dorian Ho), fashion designers from both Hong Kong and Korea, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello). Good afternoon. It is my tremendous pleasure to join you for LOCAL POWER 2025 Hong Kong Fashion in Seoul. Thank you for joining us today, gathering here to witness the magic of fashion design and its power to foster cultural exchange and friendship between Hong Kong and Korea.

As the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, I have been eagerly anticipating today's event. I actually had a preview earlier this month at Hong Kong's own CENTRESTAGE fashion gala, and I was deeply impressed. Today's full showcase promises to be even more captivating, featuring over 70 unique designs from 30 emerging designers and brands from Hong Kong and other cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area), alongside five of Korea's top designers.

But LOCAL POWER 2025 is more than just a fashion show. It is an exciting, interactive experience, enhanced by artificial intelligence and brought to live with live Cantopop and K-pop performances. Through this hybrid showcase, you will get a true taste of Hong Kong's vibrant and diverse creative industries.

This event is a perfect example of our commitment, as outlined in our Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, to strengthen the arts and creative ecosystem in Hong Kong. With Hong Kong's unique role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, we are proud to sponsor projects like this through our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency, CCIDA. Our goal is to present our new generation of Greater Bay Area fashion design talents to the world, enhance their international exposure and help build powerful local brands.

As a key part of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul, this groundbreaking collaboration provides a creative platform for elite designers from Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area and Korea. It elevates our cultural and creative partnership to the next level. 

Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul was officially launched yesterday, bringing 14 selected programmes - about 65 performances and activities - to Korea, from dance and music to film, Chinese painting and comics. Your participation here today provides the momentum to further connect the creative talents of Hong Kong and Korea.

Speaking of connection, I would like to extend an invitation to you all. This coming November to December, Hong Kong will be hosting the Hong Kong Fashion Fest. As our Chief Executive outlined in his Policy Address, our vision is to develop Hong Kong into Asia's leading fashion design hub. The Hong Kong Fashion Fest is our annual spotlight event, a spectacular tapestry of design happenings across the city. This year, we are taking it a step further by collaborating with Paris and Milan Fashion Weeks to promote digital and sustainable fashion. I sincerely welcome all of you to join us in Hong Kong for this extravaganza. Please stay tuned for details.

Before I close, I must express my heartfelt appreciation to the Asian New Generation Creativity Design Association and Dorian himself, for organising this project. And my gratitude also goes to today's performing artists, Mr Chu Wan-pin, and Shownu and Hyungwon of MONSTA X, as well as various supporting organisations.

I wish LOCAL POWER 2025 Hong Kong Fashion in Seoul a roaring success, and all the participating designers a rewarding and inspiring journey fashion show and the exhibition that follows.

Thank you. Kamsahamnida (Korean: Thank you)."

Fourth Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Statistical Forum successfully held (with photos),2025-09-27 13:30,2025-09-27 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092500998.htm,"The Fourth Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Statistical Forum was held yesterday (September 26) via live streaming. Under the guidance of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the forum was hosted by the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Statistics (GPBS) and jointly organised by the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Statistics and the People's Government of Huangpu District of Guangzhou Municipality. The Commissioner for Census and Statistics, Mr Leo Yu, and some C&SD statistical professionals participated in this major annual event.

This year's forum, themed ""Statistical Innovation and Technological Breakthroughs in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"", aimed to foster statistical exchange and co-operation in the GBA. It provided a platform for statistical professionals from the ""9+2"" cities to brainstorm collectively and drive innovation in statistical methods and technologies through creative thinking, jointly addressing the current complex and ever-changing environment.ãIn addition to the participation of leaders from the NBS and the GPBS, the forum brought together statistical experts from various fields, including representatives from the government statistical agencies of the ""9+2"" cities in the GBA, as well as those from higher education institutions and research institutes from the Chinese Mainland.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the forum, Mr Yu pointed out that the C&SD has consistently adhered to the guiding principles of ""upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground; establishing the new before abolishing the old"" on the path of advancing statistical reform and innovation. While upholding the spirit of professionalism in statistics, maintaining objectivity and neutrality, respecting privacy and ensuring data security, he encourages his colleagues to boldly break boundaries, actively embrace new techniques, strive for excellence, and continuously enhance the work cost-effectiveness and service quality.

Mr Yu also remarked that in today's rapidly changing digital era, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer merely a tool but a powerful force profoundly transforming our ways of working and thinking. In the field of statistics, the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of massive data are often time-consuming and labour-intensive. AI can efficiently handle repetitive tasks, freeing up the team's energy and time to focus on strategic assessment and innovative applications. Therefore, instead of replacing statistical professionals, AI will become an indispensable ""new member"" of the team, by effectively enhancing the team's ability to process and analyse data.

Senior Statistician of the C&SD Mr Ronald Chan also delivered a presentation entitled ""Strategies for application of data science in official statistics"" at one of the sessions of the forum. The staff members of the C&SD who participated in the forum unanimously expressed that this forum enabled them to acquire insights into the ongoing advancement of statistical techniques on the Chinese Mainland, and reminded them to strive for innovation and actively pursue breakthroughs in the dynamic era of big data, so as to seize opportunities and tackle challenges in the future.

The forum, held online, was attended by representatives of statistical organisations from Beijing, Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao, etc. Relevant officials from the statistical systems of the cities in the GBA, as well as experts and scholars from national think tanks and renowned universities, also shared their valuable insights on topics such as applications of data science techniques, development of statistical talent, statistical reform and innovation, economic monitoring and forecasting, etc."
第四屆粵港澳大灣區統計論壇圓滿舉行 （附圖）,2025-09-27 13:30,2025-09-27 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092500994.htm,"第四屆粵港澳大灣區統計論壇昨日（九月二十六日）以線上直播形式舉行。在國家統計局指導下，論壇由廣東省統計局主辦，並由廣州市統計局和廣州市黃埔區人民政府聯合承辦。政府統計處處長余振強與數名該處專業統計人員一同參與這項一年一度的盛事。

今年論壇的主題為「粵港澳大灣區統計創新與技術突破」，旨在促進粵港澳大灣區統計交流合作，讓「9+2」城市的統計專業人員可以集思廣益，以創新思維推動統計方法與技術的革新，攜手應󠇡對當前複雜多變的環境。除了國家統計局和廣東省統計局的領導參與，論壇亦匯聚了不同範疇的統計專家，包括來自粵港澳大灣區「9+2」城市的政府統計機構代表，以及中國內地高等院校和研究機構代表。

余振強在論壇開幕式致辭時表示，在推進統計改革與創新的道路上，統計處一直秉持「守正創新、先立後破」的工作方針。在堅守統計專業精神、保持客觀中立、尊重私隱和保障數據安全的前提下，他鼓勵同事勇於突破框架、積極擁抱新技術、追求卓越，持續提升工作成本效益和服務質量。

余振強亦闡述在當前瞬息萬變的數字時代，人工智能已經不單是一種工具，更是一股正在深刻改變工作方式和思維模式的強大力量。在統計領域中，海量數據的搜集、處理、分析和解讀往往耗時費力，而人工智能可以高效完成重複性的工作，釋放團隊更多精力和時間，專注於策略研判與創新應用。因此人工智能不但不會取代專業統計人員，反而會成為團隊中不可或缺的「新成員」，有效提升處理和分析數據的能力。

政府統計處高級統計師陳志豪亦在論壇中一個環節發表題為「數據科學在官方統計工作中的應用策略」的專題演講。參與論壇的統計處人員均表示，是次論壇讓他們了解到中國內地的統計技術正不斷深化，提醒他們在日新月異的大數據時代更要勇於創新和積極尋求突破，以迎接未來的機遇和挑戰。

是次論壇以線上形式舉辦，來自北京、廣東省、香港及澳門等的統計機構均有代表參與。大灣區各城市統計系統的相關人員，以及國家級智庫和知名高校專家學者，亦就數據科學技術的應用、統計人才培育、統計改革創新、經濟監測和預測等課題分享真知灼見。"
HKO and National Time Service Center sign agreement to strengthen collaboration in time services (with photos),2025-09-27 13:15,2025-09-27 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092600360.htm,"The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and the National Time Service Center (NTSC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences signed the first co-operation agreement at the HKO Headquarters today (September 27) to enhance collaboration in time measurement, time-keeping and time services, as well as the exchange of related experiences and technologies.

 The agreement was signed by the Director of the HKO, Dr Chan Pak-wai, and the Director of the NTSC, Dr Zhang Shougang. The Secretary for Environment and Ecology of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Tse Chin-wan, witnessed the signing ceremony.

 At the signing ceremony, Dr Chan said, ""The HKO was set up in 1883. The provision of an accurate time service, particularly for mariners, has been one of its primary responsibilities since its establishment. From astronomical observations using the transit instrument at the beginning to the introduction of pendulum clocks in the 1920s, quartz-controlled timing systems in the 1960s, and then the adoption of the caesium beam atomic clock commencing in 1980, the Observatory's timing services have continuously developed with the times. Recognising that the NTSC is the official keeper of China's Atomic Time Standard and the developer of spaceborne atomic clocks, the platform for space-ground integrated satellite navigation time service, and the high-precision ground-based time service system, now is an opportune time to strengthen close collaboration between the HKO and the NTSC from a national strategic perspective.""

 Dr Zhang said, ""The NTSC is the only specialised and comprehensive research institute in China dedicated to both the foundational and applied research in time and frequency. We are responsible for generating, maintaining, and disseminating China's National Standard Time (Beijing Time). In recent years, the deviation between the National Standard Time generated and maintained by the NTSC and the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) has remained within two nanoseconds, achieving the highest accuracy internationally. Our contribution to the calculation of the International Atomic Time ranks second globally. The Center maintains a long-standing partnership with the HKO. This time, we will further deepen our co-operation with the Observatory. Through joint timekeeping, fibre-optic time service, data sharing, and other initiatives, we will work together to enhance the accuracy and reliability of time services in Hong Kong, jointly promote the development of integrated atomic time, and further enhance our country's capability to maintain the time standard.""

 Before the signing ceremony, both sides conducted a high-level meeting to discuss the short-term and long-term plans for collaboration in time service enhancement and the target objectives. The Observatory will deploy reliable equipment and methods to acquire multiple time sources from NTSC to further enhance the reliability and resilience of local time service provision. In addition to the continual participation in the determination of UTC by providing atomic clock time data to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France, the Observatory also plans to participate in the Joint Atomic Time System of China to jointly promote the development of integrated atomic time."

合作協議由香港天文台台長陳栢緯博士與國家授時中心主任張首剛博士簽署，並由香港特別行政區環境及生態局局長謝展寰出席見證。

陳栢緯博士在簽署儀式上表示：「香港天文台在一八八三年成立，開台的重點職責之一是提供精準的授時服務，特別是為航海人員。從最初使用中星儀進行天文觀測，到一九二○年代引入的擺鐘、一九六○年代的石英報時系統，再到一九八○年開始採用銫原子鐘，天文台的授時服務隨時代不斷發展。國家授時中心是中國原子時標準的官方守護者，也是星載原子鐘、天地一體化衛星導航授時平台及高精度地基授時系統的開發者，從國家戰略的角度出發，現時是香港天文台與國家授時中心加強緊密合作的好時機。」

張首剛博士說：「國家授時中心是我國唯一的專門、全面從事時間頻率基礎研究和應用研究的科研機構，承擔著我國國家標準時間（北京時間）的產生、保持和授時發播任務。近年來，國家授時中心產生和保持的國家標準時間與協調世界時（UTC）的偏差數值保持在兩納秒以內，準確度達到國際第一，對國際原子時計算的貢獻位列全球第二。國家授時中心與香港天文台長期保持著友好的夥伴關係。此次，我們將進一步深化與香港天文台的合作，通過聯合守時，光纖授時、數據共享等方式，一同提升香港地區的時間服務的準確性和可靠性，共同推動綜合原子時的發展，增強我國時間基準的保持能力。」

簽署儀式前雙方舉行了高層會議，探討在增強授時服務方面的短期和長期合作計劃以及目標成果。天文台將部署運用可靠的設備和方法，從國家授時中心獲取多個時間源，進一步提升本地授時服務的可靠性和堅韌性。除了參與協調世界時的訂定，向位於法國的國際計量局提供原子鐘時間數據外，天文台還計劃加入中國聯綜合原子時系統，共同推動綜合原子時的發展。"
Speech by SHYA at Youth Development Summit (English only) (with photo),2025-09-27 13:02,2025-09-27 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700408.htm,"âFollowing is the speech by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, at the Youth Development Summit today (September 27):

President Xu (President of All-China Youth Federation, Mr Xu Xiao), Minister Yeoh (the Minister of Youth and Sports, Malaysia, Ms Hannah Yeoh), Deputy Minister AlMajed (the Deputy Minister of Society Development at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mr Ahmed Saleh AlMajed), Deputy Minister Keophilavong (the Deputy Secretary General of the Central Committee, Lao People's Revolutionary Youth Union, Mr Souliya Keophilavong), Vice Minister Kochetov (the Vice Minister of Culture and Information, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mr Yevgeniy Kochetov), Deputy Director-General Qu (the Deputy Director-General, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Dr Qu Xing), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all to the second edition of the Youth Development Summit, a vibrant gathering that celebrates the boundless potential of our youth under the inspiring theme of ""Connecting the World into the Future"". This theme captures our collective vision of empowering young people to forge connections across cultures and pave the way for a brighter, more interconnected tomorrow together. Last year, we launched this Summit with tremendous energy, with a view to sparking meaningful dialogues and a shared commitment to youth development as the cornerstone of the future of our city, our country and the world. This year, we take the next step together, building on that momentum to foster even deeper connections and opportunities for the next generation.

In this year's Government Work Report at the 14th National People's Congress, Premier Li Qiang called on Hong Kong to deepen international exchanges and co-operation. We embrace that call with concrete actions and plans. For our young people, it means opening doors to new horizons, where they can learn from the world and share Hong Kong's unique story with pride. For our city, it is a chance to cement our role as ""super connector"", bridging talent, ideas and aspirations across cultures and continents.

This very Summit is the embodiment of that spirit of connection and collaboration. We are joined today by distinguished officials, visionary leaders and innovators of different fields from around the globe, alongside youth delegates from diverse backgrounds. Together, you are the proof that when young minds come together, they ignite creativity, foster understanding, and drive innovation that transcends boundaries.

Central to our mission is the Youth Development Blueprint, which was released by my bureau in December 2022. Since its release, we have been taking forward youth development work alongside other policy bureaux, implementing at full steam some 160 measures set out in the Blueprint. Additionally, policy bureaux have introduced around 90 new measures to ensure that the Blueprint progresses with the times and is dynamic and responsive to the changing needs of our youth.

Across the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, bureaux and departments have various measures and initiatives in place to echo Premier Li's call, and I am proud to highlight some of our key initiatives today.

One of our core focuses is opening up the world to our youth through exchange and internship opportunities. In addition to establishing a foothold in Hong Kong, we encourage young people to explore the rich history, culture and opportunities of our country and beyond. Our multi-pronged approach ensures that young people from all walks of life can access these experiences at different stages of their development.

We offer diverse internship opportunities in the Chinese Mainland and overseas, helping young people gain hands-on insights into workplace cultures, set career goals and build networks. Last year, around 5000 young people took part in these programmes, ranging from working as interns inside world-class UNESCO heritage sites of the Palace Museum and Dunhuang Academy, to making meaningful contributions to international affairs through volunteer internships in the overseas field units of various United Nations agencies.

Beyond internships, we also have in place a wide spectrum of exchange programmes, deepening young people's understanding of our country and the world, as well as fostering meaningful exchanges between them and young people around the world. Last year, more than 30000 youth explored various provinces and cities in the Chinese Mainland, as well as 42 countries and regions across five continents. To ensure that grassroots youth would not be denied the opportunity to discover new horizons, we have especially launched a pilot scheme last year to provide additional subsidies for the underprivileged to participate in these exchange activities.

Looking ahead, as newly announced by our Chief Executive Mr John Lee in the 2025 Policy Address last week, we will launch a Young Talent Training Programme to expand opportunities for internships with international organisations and participation in global conferences. We will also introduce a new media thematic internship programme in the Chinese Mainland, which will further equip our youth to tell compelling stories on the global stage.

In addition to going global, we welcome with open arms young people from the Chinese Mainland and all over the world to visit Hong Kong. Last year, some 2800 youth participated in our inbound exchange projects. This year, we have rolled out a number of enhancement measures to further encourage two-way exchange projects, fostering dialogues and friendships between Hong Kong youth and their peers across the Chinese Mainland and globally.

The Youth Development Summit itself is a flagship event for promoting international youth exchange. For today's Summit, I am excited to share that we have gathered about 600 youth delegates from the Chinese Mainland and 33 countries. Aside from the Summit, we are also organising thematic visit programmes for them to explore Hong Kong together with local youth, which will enable them to learn more about Hong Kong's latest development in technological innovation, culture and arts, etc and promote cross-territory youth exchange.

Closer to home, we are creating vibrant spaces to spark creativity and connection. Last year, we unveiled plans to transform the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into the ""Youth Post"" hostel, a dynamic place in a beautiful setting near the Victoria Harbour, fostering cultural, arts and sports exchanges. Since its trial launch in July this year, the Youth Post has hosted exciting activities such as skateboarding performances, busking sessions, and concert after-parties tied to Kai Tak Sports Park. Some of the youth delegates joining us at this Summit are actually staying on-site, experiencing its vibrant atmosphere firsthand. With feedback from our youth, we are gearing up for its official opening this year. Over the next five years, the Youth Post plans to host around 100 diverse activities, offering affordable accommodation for youth visitors from the Chinese Mainland and abroad while fostering exchanges that inspire creativity.

Alongside promoting international youth exchange, youth engagement is also at the heart of our youth development efforts. Youth Link, a youth network we launched in September 2023, now connects over 18000 members. It bridges participants from various government youth programmes, offering them the opportunities to develop talents and build trust with the Government. Members have participated in Youth Dialogue sessions with senior government officials and outbound exchange tours, volunteered at major government events, and even attended international events. For example, several Youth Link members represented Hong Kong, China, at the official youth development programme under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) framework held in Peru in November last year, engaging in meaningful exchanges with peers across the region.

We are also expanding physical spaces for youth engagement. Youth Square, located in Chai Wan as a dedicated hub for youth development, provides a vibrant venue for young people to connect and learn through events and activities. By year-end, its first phase of renovations will unveil a new interactive space and video studio. Coupled with the ""Good Stories of Hong Kong Youth"" Programme, young people will create videos to share inspiring stories about Hong Kong, supported by training in production and filming. Similarly, in the dynamic district of Sham Shui Po, known for its rich cultural heritage and bustling creative energy, the renovations at the Nam Cheong District Community Centre and the adjacent Tung Chau Street Temporary Market will provide a lively hub for Youth Link members to connect and grow their networks. The first phase of the renovation works will be completed by the end of this year.

While our bureau spearheads many youth development initiatives, we work hand in hand with all bureaux to advance this shared mission. For example, the Education Bureau plays a vital role in broadening global horizons for students. Since the 2016/17 academic year, the Belt and Road Scholarship has encouraged outstanding students from 49 Belt and Road countries to pursue publicly-funded undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Hong Kong. Over 680 students have been awarded the scholarship to date. We are thrilled to have over 70 of these awardees with us at the Summit this morning, bringing diverse insights to our discussions. The Scheme for Subsidy on Exchange for Post-secondary Students, introduced in 2015 and later expanded to Belt and Road regions in 2016 and 2019, aids students in participating in international exchanges, internships, service programmes, and competitions, with 35 institutions participated in 2024/25. Furthermore, life-wide learning strategies, supported by a flexible curriculum and grants such as the Life-wide Learning and Sister School Grant and the Student Activities Support Grant, enable students from all backgrounds to engage in STEAM competitions and study tours outside ordinary classroom settings, cultivating informed and responsible global citizens.

Ladies and gentlemen, our young people are stepping into a world that is more interconnected yet more challenging than ever. Through these initiatives, we are equipping them not just to navigate this changing landscape but to shape it with confidence and purpose.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to the Youth Development Blueprint, scaling up partnerships and opportunities to make international exchange a transformative experience for the next generation. With the unique positioning of Hong Kong, anchored in our country and open to the world, we are determined to be the ""super connector"" our youth need. I invite you all to join us in this mission. Together, we can unlock endless possibilities for our young people and, in doing so, for our shared global future. Thank you."

Last year, more than 30000 youth explored various provinces and cities in the Chinese Mainland, as well as 42 countries and regions across five continents. To ensure that grassroots youth would not be denied the opportunity to discover new horizons, we have especially launched a pilot scheme last year to provide additional subsidies for the underprivileged to participate in these exchange activities.

Looking ahead, as newly announced by our Chief Executive Mr John Lee in the 2025 Policy Address last week, we will launch a Young Talent Training Programme to expand opportunities for internships with international organisations and participation in global conferences. We will also introduce a new media thematic internship programme in the Chinese Mainland, which will further equip our youth to tell compelling stories on the global stage.

In addition to going global, we welcome with open arms young people from the Chinese Mainland and all over the world to visit Hong Kong. Last year, some 2800 youth participated in our inbound exchange projects. This year, we have rolled out a number of enhancement measures to further encourage two-way exchange projects, fostering dialogues and friendships between Hong Kong youth and their peers across the Chinese Mainland and globally.

The Youth Development Summit itself is a flagship event for promoting international youth exchange. For today's Summit, I am excited to share that we have gathered about 600 youth delegates from the Chinese Mainland and 33 countries. Aside from the Summit, we are also organising thematic visit programmes for them to explore Hong Kong together with local youth, which will enable them to learn more about Hong Kong's latest development in technological innovation, culture and arts, etc and promote cross-territory youth exchange.

Closer to home, we are creating vibrant spaces to spark creativity and connection. Last year, we unveiled plans to transform the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into the ""Youth Post"" hostel, a dynamic place in a beautiful setting near the Victoria Harbour, fostering cultural, arts and sports exchanges. Since its trial launch in July this year, the Youth Post has hosted exciting activities such as skateboarding performances, busking sessions, and concert after-parties tied to Kai Tak Sports Park. Some of the youth delegates joining us at this Summit are actually staying on-site, experiencing its vibrant atmosphere firsthand. With feedback from our youth, we are gearing up for its official opening this year. Over the next five years, the Youth Post plans to host around 100 diverse activities, offering affordable accommodation for youth visitors from the Chinese Mainland and abroad while fostering exchanges that inspire creativity.

Alongside promoting international youth exchange, youth engagement is also at the heart of our youth development efforts. Youth Link, a youth network we launched in September 2023, now connects over 18000 members. It bridges participants from various government youth programmes, offering them the opportunities to develop talents and build trust with the Government. Members have participated in Youth Dialogue sessions with senior government officials and outbound exchange tours, volunteered at major government events, and even attended international events. For example, several Youth Link members represented Hong Kong, China, at the official youth development programme under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) framework held in Peru in November last year, engaging in meaningful exchanges with peers across the region.

We are also expanding physical spaces for youth engagement. Youth Square, located in Chai Wan as a dedicated hub for youth development, provides a vibrant venue for young people to connect and learn through events and activities. By year-end, its first phase of renovations will unveil a new interactive space and video studio. Coupled with the ""Good Stories of Hong Kong Youth"" Programme, young people will create videos to share inspiring stories about Hong Kong, supported by training in production and filming. Similarly, in the dynamic district of Sham Shui Po, known for its rich cultural heritage and bustling creative energy, the renovations at the Nam Cheong District Community Centre and the adjacent Tung Chau Street Temporary Market will provide a lively hub for Youth Link members to connect and grow their networks. The first phase of the renovation works will be completed by the end of this year.

While our bureau spearheads many youth development initiatives, we work hand in hand with all bureaux to advance this shared mission. For example, the Education Bureau plays a vital role in broadening global horizons for students. Since the 2016/17 academic year, the Belt and Road Scholarship has encouraged outstanding students from 49 Belt and Road countries to pursue publicly-funded undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Hong Kong. Over 680 students have been awarded the scholarship to date. We are thrilled to have over 70 of these awardees with us at the Summit this morning, bringing diverse insights to our discussions. The Scheme for Subsidy on Exchange for Post-secondary Students, introduced in 2015 and later expanded to Belt and Road regions in 2016 and 2019, aids students in participating in international exchanges, internships, service programmes, and competitions, with 35 institutions participated in 2024/25. Furthermore, life-wide learning strategies, supported by a flexible curriculum and grants such as the Life-wide Learning and Sister School Grant and the Student Activities Support Grant, enable students from all backgrounds to engage in STEAM competitions and study tours outside ordinary classroom settings, cultivating informed and responsible global citizens.

Ladies and gentlemen, our young people are stepping into a world that is more interconnected yet more challenging than ever. Through these initiatives, we are equipping them not just to navigate this changing landscape but to shape it with confidence and purpose.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to the Youth Development Blueprint, scaling up partnerships and opportunities to make international exchange a transformative experience for the next generation. With the unique positioning of Hong Kong, anchored in our country and open to the world, we are determined to be the ""super connector"" our youth need. I invite you all to join us in this mission. Together, we can unlock endless possibilities for our young people and, in doing so, for our shared global future. Thank you."

尊敬的施子清博士、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興出席今天的「九十禮讚翰墨華章——施子清博士書法回顧展」，與大家一同欣賞施博士數十年來用心鑽研的書法造詣，感受中華傳統文化藝術的韻味和生命力。很多謝司儀剛剛很詳細介紹了施博士早年來到香港一直到現在如何為藝術、如何為香港作出巨大的貢獻，介紹得很詳細，而且不用看稿。

施子清博士自幼熱愛書法藝術，數十年來從未停筆，他的作品先後於北京、上海、香港、澳門、廈門等地展出，並獲得中國國家博物館收藏，可見施博士於書法界的崇高地位。

所謂「獨樂樂，不如眾樂樂」，多年來施博士帶領中國書協香港分會，致力於書法藝術的推廣和傳承，他親自編寫的《書法學習教程》，成功讓書法藝術走進年輕人和普羅市民的視野，發揮藝術薰陶人心的文明價值。我要衷心感謝施博士以及中國書協一直以來的努力和熱誠。

這次書法回顧展適逢施博士九十大壽，展出120件佳作，不但展示了書法藝術的技法，更呈現中華文明的精神與面貌。我知道，今次展覽是施博士與香港故宮文化博物館的再次合作，藉着香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的獨特地位，將書法這種中華文化獨有的藝術推廣開去，讓更多人能在欣賞書法作品的同時，加深認識中華文化源遠流長的歷史和思想內涵，細閱以筆墨書寫的中國好故事。

「文化藝術」是香港未來發展其中一個關鍵詞。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有的內聯外通優勢，不但成就香港成為連接國家與國際間經貿合作的雙向平台角色，更是促使中外文明交流的重要平台。

隨着內地和香港的文化交流日益緊密，我們將積極發揮香港中外文化匯聚的特色，讓中華文化從香港出發，走進國際舞台，提升中華文化的軟實力。

去年公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為香港文化藝術與創意產業的長遠發展指明方向。我們會舉辦及支持更多大型、多元的文化藝術活動和合作，為中外文化藝術交流搭建平台，推動中華優秀傳統文化的傳承與弘揚。

書法是中華文化的重要載體，承載着民族精神，也凝聚着文化自信。本屆政府全力推展愛國主義教育，在社會厚植愛國情懷，而文化自信和自豪感，正正是凝聚我們齊心貢獻國家，建設香港的精神命脈和力量泉源。

最後，我祝願這次巡迴展覽圓滿成功，期望大家從施博士的墨寶中，細味書法藝術的魅力，並透過筆墨之道，打開探索中華璀璨文化寶藏的大門。多謝大家。"

Reporter: In the Policy Address, it says that six more Community Living Rooms (CLRs) will be set up in Hong Kong. Could you reveal when will the public could see these newly set up CLRs and when would the first one be opened according to the Government's timelines? And as for thosewhich have been in operation since 2023, does the Government intend to keep them running after the three-year program when it comes to an end?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. Right now we have nine CLRs in operation. In the Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced six more will be coming. So our plans for the coming year or so, at least six CLRs will be opened.

In terms of district, we believe we should be able to see CLRs in operation, say in the Yau Tsim Mong District, and also in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Ching. These are the areas we don't have any CLR right now. As for the existing CLRs, I think the concern is over the four CLRs that have been in operation for more than a year. In fact, for the first one in Shum Shui Po, it has been in operation more than one and a half year, so given the first agreement was that they would be provided free of charge for three years, it's inevitable that we are thinking about the renewal. We are grateful to the donors of these four CLRs, i.e. the Sino Group, the Henderson Land Group, and also the China Resources Group. They are going to provide another three years of extension of their leases. That means for these four CLRs will be provided to us free of charge together with the renovation cost for six years.

Reporter: So earlier in July, the Government has launched a pilot scheme in helping to identify families at risk. For example, when a caregiver has admitted to the hospital, the Hospital Authority (HA) would pass a message to the Social Welfare Department (SWD) who will reach out to the elderly in need. Would you also give us an update given that the program has been running for about two months now?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. Indeed, starting from mid-July this year, we are finally be able to make use of the big data available in the SWD, in the HA, and also in the Housing Department (HD). We are launching two pilots at the same time. The first one is through a data matching between the HA and the SWD. We started with around 10 000 people who were in receipt of the carer allowance schemes. Right now, we have received more than 500 alerts from the HA about the hospital admission of the carers. But only two cases require urgent support, including delivery of meal to their homes and also respite services.

Turning to another pilot we have been conducting right now is a data matching process to find out the singleton or doubleton elderly households held by the HD. We have been visiting more than 5 000 households, and out of these 5 000 households, around 400 are considered to be in need of further support. We have referred them to the relevant welfare associations and organisations to provide support and services later on."

Distinguished guests and government officials from around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning, everyone! A heartfelt welcome to Hong Kong and this second edition of the Youth Development Summit.

  I spoke at last year's inaugural edition of the Summit and was delighted with the great turnout – innovators and change-makers taking part from all over the world.

  Well, this year's Summit, I'm happy to say, is even bigger, counting more than 3 000 young leaders. You're here from Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland, from East and Central Asia, the Middle East and beyond.

  And your presence here today is a testament to the growing eagerness of young people, worldwide, to come together and learn from one another, creating prospects for a more connected and prosperous global community. And this year's theme, ""Connecting the World into the Future,"" reflects that encouraging reality.

  Your participation highlights our shared commitment to promoting youth development – in Hong Kong, across the Belt and Road regions and around the world.

  The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government attaches great importance to youth. Our Youth Development Blueprint, released in late 2022, outlines our guiding principles for advancing youth development, as well as charting a clear pathway for stakeholders everywhere.

  Our vision is to nurture a new generation of youth equipped with a global perspective, a positive thinking mindset and an affection for our city and our country.

  Since the release of the Blueprint, more than 250 concrete actions and measures have been put forward, providing young people with wide-ranging opportunities and support.

  And just 10 days ago, the Chief Executive delivered his annual Policy Address. It includes a number of measures to promote youth development. Among them, a Young Talent Training Programme will expand opportunities for our youth to attend conferences and take part in the internships of international organisations.

  There will also be a new media thematic internship programme on the Mainland, a strengthened Youth Financial Education Programme, and new professional mediation workshops to help broaden young people's international perspectives and cultivate a global mindset.

  Exchange programmes for youth will also be stepped up, encouraging young people from overseas and the mainland to visit Hong Kong on exchange. Our Youth Post hostel, open now on a trial basis, officially opens later this year, providing affordable accommodation for young people, as well as a wide range of youth-focused activities and events. The goal is to encourage exchanges between Hong Kong youth and young visitors from around the world.

  This Summit is among the Youth Development Blueprint's initiatives. It brings together 20 prominent speakers, including young entrepreneurs, athletes, business professionals from I&T (Innovation and Technology) and the creative and service industries, and government and institutional leaders. I know their passion, experience and innovative insights will inspire us all.

  To you, our youth participants, this Summit is your Summit, yours to offer, and learn about, innovative solutions, create global connections and expand your horizons.

  The future belongs to you, and by taking part in today's Summit, you are one step closer to turning your ideas into tangible realities.

  Sports, and sportsmanship, is an integral element of youth – and this Summit. Sportsmanship encourages respect, fairness, integrity and teamwork.

  The 15th National Games will be held November 9 to 21, with Hong Kong hosting the Games together with Guangdong and Macao. Hong Kong will stage eight events: basketball, beach volleyball, fencing, golf, handball, rugby sevens, track cycling and triathlon.

  I invite you all to join us, in November, for this world-class sports competition, the many cultural events accompanying it and all the excitement of Hong Kong, Asia's world city.

  I am grateful to this year's Summit speakers, and to all of you, here in Hong Kong contribute your time, energy and ideas to create a better, more connected, world. Let us remember that lasting connectivity demands more than technology or infrastructure alone can offer. Empathy, understanding and a shared purpose, are no less essential.

  I am confident that, working together, we can empower a generation that is resilient, resourceful and ready to build a bright future for all.

  I wish all a rewarding Summit and an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, the world's East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

  Thank you very much."

  Exchange programmes for youth will also be stepped up, encouraging young people from overseas and the mainland to visit Hong Kong on exchange. Our Youth Post hostel, open now on a trial basis, officially opens later this year, providing affordable accommodation for young people, as well as a wide range of youth-focused activities and events. The goal is to encourage exchanges between Hong Kong youth and young visitors from around the world.

  This Summit is among the Youth Development Blueprint's initiatives. It brings together 20 prominent speakers, including young entrepreneurs, athletes, business professionals from I&T (Innovation and Technology) and the creative and service industries, and government and institutional leaders. I know their passion, experience and innovative insights will inspire us all.

  To you, our youth participants, this Summit is your Summit, yours to offer, and learn about, innovative solutions, create global connections and expand your horizons.

  The future belongs to you, and by taking part in today's Summit, you are one step closer to turning your ideas into tangible realities.

  Sports, and sportsmanship, is an integral element of youth – and this Summit. Sportsmanship encourages respect, fairness, integrity and teamwork.

  The 15th National Games will be held November 9 to 21, with Hong Kong hosting the Games together with Guangdong and Macao. Hong Kong will stage eight events: basketball, beach volleyball, fencing, golf, handball, rugby sevens, track cycling and triathlon.

  I invite you all to join us, in November, for this world-class sports competition, the many cultural events accompanying it and all the excitement of Hong Kong, Asia's world city.

  I am grateful to this year's Summit speakers, and to all of you, here in Hong Kong contribute your time, energy and ideas to create a better, more connected, world. Let us remember that lasting connectivity demands more than technology or infrastructure alone can offer. Empathy, understanding and a shared purpose, are no less essential.

  I am confident that, working together, we can empower a generation that is resilient, resourceful and ready to build a bright future for all.

  I wish all a rewarding Summit and an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, the world's East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

  Thank you very much."

Distinguished guests and government officials from around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning, everyone! A heartfelt welcome to Hong Kong and this second edition of the Youth Development Summit.

  I spoke at last year's inaugural edition of the Summit and was delighted with the great turnout – innovators and change-makers taking part from all over the world.

  Well, this year's Summit, I'm happy to say, is even bigger, counting more than 3 000 young leaders. You're here from Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland, from East and Central Asia, the Middle East and beyond.

  And your presence here today is a testament to the growing eagerness of young people, worldwide, to come together and learn from one another, creating prospects for a more connected and prosperous global community. And this year's theme, ""Connecting the World into the Future,"" reflects that encouraging reality.

  Your participation highlights our shared commitment to promoting youth development – in Hong Kong, across the Belt and Road regions and around the world.

  The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government attaches great importance to youth. Our Youth Development Blueprint, released in late 2022, outlines our guiding principles for advancing youth development, as well as charting a clear pathway for stakeholders everywhere.

  Our vision is to nurture a new generation of youth equipped with a global perspective, a positive thinking mindset and an affection for our city and our country.

  Since the release of the Blueprint, more than 250 concrete actions and measures have been put forward, providing young people with wide-ranging opportunities and support.

  And just 10 days ago, the Chief Executive delivered his annual Policy Address. It includes a number of measures to promote youth development. Among them, a Young Talent Training Programme will expand opportunities for our youth to attend conferences and take part in the internships of international organisations.

  There will also be a new media thematic internship programme on the Mainland, a strengthened Youth Financial Education Programme, and new professional mediation workshops to help broaden young people's international perspectives and cultivate a global mindset.

  Exchange programmes for youth will also be stepped up, encouraging young people from overseas and the mainland to visit Hong Kong on exchange. Our Youth Post hostel, open now on a trial basis, officially opens later this year, providing affordable accommodation for young people, as well as a wide range of youth-focused activities and events.

Dr Tony Wong (Chairman of the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation), Mr Kim Dong-hwa (renowned Korean comics artist), esteemed comics artists from Hong Kong and Korea, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello). Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you for the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong Comics and Culture Exhibition. Today, we gather to unleash the unlimited potential of comic creations with our Korean friends and to strengthen the amicable ties between the cultural and creative industries of Hong Kong and Korea.

Comics are more than just a form of entertainment; they are a vibrant art form that captures our way of life, echoes our collective memories, and expresses our unique cultural identities. By showcasing the works of 19 Hong Kong comic artists across generations, alongside two internationally-acclaimed Korean comic artists, this exhibition initiates a powerful creative dialogue. It offers us all a wonderful opportunity to understand each other's lives and cultures more deeply.

Some of you may already be familiar with our classic, iconic characters like ""Old Master Q"" (èå¤«å­) and ""My Boy"" (çä»), who have won the hearts of generations around the globe. Today, we have brought a diverse collection of these and many more characters to meet our Korean friends. Our exhibits include exciting crossovers between contemporary comics, film, television, games, and art toys. I encourage you all to take your time to explore and enjoy the authentic humour and satirical wit of Hong Kong comics.

This exhibition is made possible with the support of my Bureau's Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and the tremendous efforts of the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation. The Federation's work is vital to our industry's growth. For instance, through its Hong Kong Comics Support Programme launched in 2021, we have nurtured new talents and publishing enterprises. This initiative has already led to the publication of 63 original comics and secured over 30 licensing agreements for foreign-language editions. This is a testament to the global appeal and competitiveness of Hong Kong, as it effectively expands their reach into overseas markets. Here today, you will see artworks from six of the award-winning artists of the Programme.

This exhibition is also a highlight of the Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul, which officially began last night. The week features 14 curated programmes with around 65 performances and activities. I sincerely hope that you will join us for these events and enjoy the array of arts and culture we have brought from Hong Kong to Korea.

In closing, I would like to congratulate the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation and all the talented comic artists from Hong Kong and Korea for making this exceptional exhibition a reality.

I wish the Hong Kong Comics and Culture Exhibition a resounding success and look forward to more fruitful collaborations between Hong Kong and Korea in the years to come.

Kamsahamnida (Korean: Thank you). Thank you."

VSB enhances regulatory measures for registered veterinary surgeons,2025-09-27 10:37,2025-09-27 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092601131.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Veterinary Surgeons Board of Hong Kong:

The Veterinary Surgeons Board of Hong Kong (VSB) announced a series of measures to enhance the regulation of the veterinary practice of the registered veterinary surgeons (RVSs) and veterinary services in Hong Kong today (September 27).

The VSB has been closely monitoring public opinions in enhancing veterinary services. As the statutory body responsible for the regulation, registration, and disciplinary control of professional activities of RVSs, the VSB is committed to ensuring that veterinary services in Hong Kong are maintained at a high standard. After carefully gauging stakeholders' views, referencing practices from other regions, and balancing the needs of all parties, the VSB has introduced the following specific measures:

(1) Increasing the transparency of veterinary profession and enhancing the disciplinary inquiry arrangement


Extending publication periods of disciplinary orders: The VSB has extended the periods of publication of disciplinary orders made after March 26, 2025. The publication period for orders involving removal of names from the register of RVSs has been extended from one year to three years; and that for other orders, from one year to two years (both with the RVSs' names published). As regards publication of orders in an anonymised manner for educational purposes, the period has been extended from three years to indefinitely;




Providing guidance for disciplinary inquiries: A set of Inquiry Committee Guidance Manual has been compiled for reference by inquiry committees when adjudicating disciplinary inquiries against RVSs;




Mandating display of veterinarians' full names at clinics and name identification in medical records: RVSs (including locum RVSs) must display their full names prominently at the entrances or within the waiting areas of the clinics at which they practise. Additionally, the treating RVSs should be identified by name in the medical records of all consultations and procedures; and




Enhancing the reporting requirements for practising addresses: RVSs (including locum RVSs) are required to report their current regular or most regular practising addresses, enabling public access to current addresses at which RVSs primarily practise.


(2) Strengthening the regulation of the profession and public education


Introducing requirements on the use of complementary/alternative treatments and substances: RVSs must ensure that the use of complementary or alternative treatments and substances is in the animals' best interest and would yield equal or better results than the sole use of the available conventional treatments or medications for the condition concerned;




Introducing requirements on governing the use of telemedicine in veterinary practice: No veterinary service shall be provided using remote means of communication, unless the veterinary surgeon has conducted a physical examination of the animal within the preceding six months that reasonably suffices to enable the veterinary service to be provided without a further physical examination of the animal;




Suggested items in seeking clients' consent: A suggested items checklist was published for reference of the veterinary profession in seeking clients' consent in treatment and care of animals; and




Enhancing publicity of the types of veterinary service: Enhancing public education and publicity to help animal owners distinguish between general and specialised veterinary practices, enabling them to make informed choices about the services they need.


(3) Increasing understanding of the current situation and need for regulating the veterinary nursing profession


Survey on the veterinary nursing profession in Hong Kong: The VSB has launched a survey on the veterinary nursing professionin August this year, aiming to gather demographic information from RVSs, veterinary nursing practitioners (such as veterinary nurses, veterinary assistants, and veterinary technicians), as well as clinic owners. Information collected includes the number of practitioners engaged in veterinary nursing, their qualifications, areas of work, and their perspectives on regulation of the veterinary nursing profession.Based on analysis of the survey findings and with reference to the situations of the profession in Hong Kong and abroad, the VSB will explore the feasibility of establishing a regulatory framework for veterinary nursing practitioners.


Part of the above measures involve amendments to the Code of Practice for the Guidance of Registered Veterinary Surgeons and the Rules of the Veterinary Surgeons Board (Registration of Veterinary Surgeons). The VSB notified RVSs of the amendments in late August this year. The amendments will take effect from September 29, 2025 and will be available on the VSB's website (www.vsbhk.org.hk/english/rules/relevant.html). RVSs should read through and acquaint themselves thoroughly with the amendments thereby avoiding the danger of inadvertently transgressing accepted codes of professional ethical behaviour which may lead to disciplinary actions.

The VSB will continue to listen to views from various sectors of the community; and safeguard the health and welfare of animals and interests of animal owners, through the development and improvement of professional standards and registration of veterinary surgeons."
財經事務及庫務局局長在波蘭深入了解「出海」企業需要（附圖）,2025-09-27 10:00,2025-09-27 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092601183.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇在結束波蘭訪問前，到訪華沙證券交易所，並與波蘭官員和商界人士會面。他也參觀了一家在波蘭蒂黑設廠的內地企業，了解「出海」企業的需要。

許正宇九月二十五日（華沙時間）到訪華沙證券交易所，與行政總裁Tomasz Bardziłowski及其他管理層會面。華沙證券交易所由波蘭財政部創立，是中歐和東歐地區的主要金融產品交易所。

會面期間，許正宇向他們介紹了香港股市強勁的發展勢頭，包括今年首八個月的每日平均成交額達270億歐元，以及背後的政策支持。他表示，香港特別行政區政府致力於加強上市平台和證券市場的廣度和深度。行政長官在剛發表的二○二五年《施政報告》中宣布一系列旨在持續強化股票市場的新舉措，包括進一步完善主板上市和結構性產品發行機制，以及推動更多海外企業來港第二上市。華沙證券交易所認為內地與香港是現今經濟的增長引擎，許正宇期待與華沙證券交易所建立更多聯繫，令兩地股票市場更多元化，包括華沙證券所有興趣的現實世界資產代幣化。

隨後，許正宇與波蘭經濟發展及科技部副部長Michał Baranowski會面，向他介紹香港在財富管理和股票巿場的亮麗表現，以及各項推動金融增長的新措施，包括建立國際黃金交易巿場，當中涵蓋由政府牽頭的香港黃金中央清算系統。

他其後與波蘭財政部副部長Jarosław Neneman、國際稅務政策署署長Cezary Krysiak和國際合作署署長Paweł Siwek會面，要求將香港從波蘭的「採用損害性稅務措施的稅務管轄區名單」（名單）中剔除。許正宇強調，香港一直全力支持國際社會提升稅務透明度和打擊逃稅的工作，而經濟合作與發展組織亦沒有發現香港有任何損害性稅務措施。

波蘭財政部注意到在按請求交換資料方面，香港已獲稅務透明化及有效交換資料全球論壇評定為大致符合國際標準，而香港也不在歐洲聯盟的稅務合作事宜觀察名單上。在考慮各項相關因素後，波蘭財政部會積極考慮將香港從名單中剔除。

許正宇亦建議波蘭與香港早日就全面性避免雙重課稅協定（全面性協定）啓動磋商。雙方均認同兩地簽訂全面性協定對促進雙邊貿易大有裨益，實屬互惠互利。

下午，許正宇與波蘭外交部副部長Wojciech Zajączkowski會面，並向他提到在同日發布的第38期《全球金融中心指數》報告中香港穩居第三位，整體評分與位列第一的紐約和第二的倫敦的分數差距，分別收窄至2分和1分。在金融科技水平方面，香港躍升至第一位，而「營商環境」、「基礎設施」及「聲譽及綜合」方面也同樣升至全球第一。波蘭和香港在各自地區扮演門戶角色，兩地可以在多個領域合作，促進內地企業進入歐洲巿場，以及歐洲企業透過香港進入亞洲和中國巿場。

許正宇也出席了由中國建設銀行舉辦的商務午餐會，與已在歐洲開展業務的多家知名內地企業管理層會面。許正宇向他們保證，香港致力於成為「引進來、走出去」的平台，支持內地企業拓展海外業務。他指出，除了世界級的專業服務和完善的金融體系外，香港還有多方面的優勢可協助企業進一步拓展業務。

同日，許正宇也拜訪了中國駐波蘭大使館公使參贊李丹鴻，向她介紹香港金融環境的最新狀況。

許正宇九月二十六日（蒂黑時間）結束波蘭之行前，造訪了三花亞威科波蘭電器設備有限公司，與該公司的管理團隊會面，並參觀了該公司位於蒂黑的廠房。蒂黑廠房是該公司在歐洲三大主要生產基地中規模最大的。

在與三花集團三花歐洲平台總經理及財務中心總監姚彬和三花亞威科歐洲行政總裁劉世峰會面時，許正宇向他們詳細介紹了香港為協助內地企業通過香港「出海」而即將推出的各項舉措，以及現有的專業服務。他亦與三花管理層深入交流，以了解內地企業在拓展海外業務過程中所遇到的挑戰。

許正宇將於九月二十七日返抵香港。"
SFST gets better grasp of needs of companies go global in Poland (with photos),2025-09-27 10:00,2025-09-27 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092601192.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, visited the Warsaw Stock Exchange and met with Polish officials and members of the business sector in Warsaw, Poland before concluding his visit to the country. He also visited a Mainland enterprise which has set up factory facilities in Tychy, Poland, to learn about the needs of the go global companies.

  On September 25 (Warsaw time), Mr Hui visited the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) and met with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr Tomasz BardziÅowski, as well as other management members. The GPW was founded by the Polish State Treasury and is a major financial instrument exchange in Central and Eastern Europe.

 During the meeting, Mr Hui introduced to them the strong momentum of Hong Kong's stock market which has an average daily turnover for the first eight months of 2025 of EUR 27 billion, and the policy support behind the success. He said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is committed to strengthening the breadth and depth of the listing platform and securities market. New initiatives were just announced by the Chief Executive in his 2025 Policy Address aiming to continuously strengthen the stock market, including further optimising the regimes for listing on the Main Board and issuing structured products, as well as encouraging more overseas enterprises to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. The GPW considers the Mainland and Hong Kong to be growth engines for economy nowadays. Mr Hui anticipated more connections could be established with the GPW to increase the diversity of both stock markets, including real-world asset tokenisation which the GPW is interested in.

 Later at a meeting with the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology of Poland, Mr MichaÅ Baranowski, Mr Hui introduced to him the stellar performance of Hong Kong in wealth management and its equity market, as well as new initiatives aiming to drive financial development, such as building an international gold trading market which will comprise a Government-led central clearing system for gold.

 He then met with the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance (MoF) of Poland, Mr JarosÅaw Neneman; the Director of the International Tax Policy Department in the MoFof Poland, Mr Cezary Krysiak; and the Director of the International Cooperation Department in the MoFof Poland, Mr PaweÅ Siwek, to request the removal of Hong Kong from Poland's ""list of jurisdictions with harmful tax practice"" (the List). Mr Hui highlighted that Hong Kong had been fully supporting international efforts in enhancing tax transparency and combating tax evasion and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had not identified any harmful tax regimes in Hong Kong.

 Noting that Hong Kong had been rated by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes as largely compliant in the international standards on exchange of information on request and is also not on the European Union’s watchlist on tax co-operation, the Polish MoF, taking into account all the circumstances, will positively consider removing Hong Kong from the List.

 Mr Hui also proposed to start negotiations on a Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (CDTA) between Hong Kong and Poland as soon as practicable. Both sides see that a CDTA could be conducive to bilateral trade activities, bringing substantial mutual benefits.

  In the afternoon, Mr Hui had a meeting with the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Wojciech ZajÄczkowski. Mr Hui told him that Hong Kong has maintained its ranking of third place globally, with the rating gaps with first place (New York) and second place (London) narrowed to two points and one point respectively in the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) 38 Report published on the same day. Hong Kong leaped to first place in the world in fintech offerings, and the rankings in the areas of ""business environment"", ""infrastructure"", and ""reputational and general"" also rose to first globally. With the gateway roles of Poland and Hong Kong in their respective regions, the two places can co-operate in various areas to facilitate Mainland enterprises to enter the European market, and European enterprises can access the Asian and Chinese markets through Hong Kong.

  Mr Hui also joined a business luncheon organised by the China Construction Bank to meet with management of various renowned Mainland enterprises which have set up a presence in Europe. He assured them that Hong Kong is determined to position itself as a platform for ""bringing in and going global"" to support Mainland enterprises in seeking overseas expansion. He noted that aside from world-class professional services and its robust financial regime, Hong Kong has much more to offer to assist enterprises to expand further.

  On the same day, Mr Hui also met with the Minister Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Poland, Ms Li Danhong, to update her on the financial landscape in Hong Kong.

  Before concluding his visit to Poland on September 26 (Tychy time), Mr Hui went for a visit to the Sanhua AWECO Polish Appliance to meet with their management team and tour its Tychy plant which is the largest among the three key manufacturing facilities of the company across Europe.

  At a meeting with the General Manager and Chief Financial Officer of the Sanhua EMEA Shared Management Platform of Sanhua Group, Mr Yao Bing, and the Chief Executive Officer of Sanhua Aweco EMEA, Mr Liu Shifeng, Mr Hui elaborated to them on the various initiatives Hong Kong will launch and the professional services available to assist Mainland companies to go global through Hong Kong. He also had a deep discussion with them to learn more about the challenges that Mainland companies have encountered during their journey of overseas expansion.

 Mr Hui will return to Hong Kong on September 27."
