Speech by CE at Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit (English only),2025-11-04 10:09,2025-11-04 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400232.htm,"Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit today (November 4):

Honourable Executive Deputy Director Xu Qifang (Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council), Honourable Director Zhou Ji (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Honourable Deputy Governor Lu Lei (Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China), Honourable Vice Minister Zhou Liang (Vice Minister of the National Financial Regulatory Administration), Honourable Vice Chairman Li Ming (Vice Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission), Honourable Acting Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR), Mr Eddie Yue (Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. Welcome to Hong Kong, to the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, now in its fourth annual edition.

  I still remember that when I addressed the inaugural Summit in 2022, a time when the world was emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, I said the event showed that Hong Kong was onstage again.

  Three years on, I'm proud to say that Hong Kong now shines on the global stage, radiating prosperity, confidence and much-needed reassurance.

  Don't just take my word for it. In September, the Canadian-based Fraser Institute ranked Hong Kong as the freest economy in the world – that's No.1 in economic freedom. Also this September, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD), in its World Talent Ranking, rated us fourth in the world and first in Asia – our highest-ever ranking in the report.

  Still with the IMD, Hong Kong finished third in its World Competitiveness Yearbook this year, up two places from 2024. And in the Global Financial Centres Index, we placed third in the world, just one point back of London, and two behind New York.

  Ladies and gentlemen, you're here, some 300 global financial leaders from all over the world, including more than 100 group chairpersons and CEOs, to see Hong Kong for yourselves. You're here, too, to get the latest financial and investment insight and intelligence, from the Summit's high-profile speakers, and to network with a world of like-minded aficionados of finance.

  I'm sure you enjoyed last night's Welcome Dinner at the Hong Kong Palace Museum, where East meets West in a dazzling integration of modern architecture and traditional Chinese cultural elements. Because more than global rankings, Hong Kong also dazzles with cultural diversity.

  The theme of this 2025 Summit, ""Trekking through Shifting Terrain"", resonates with yet another facet of Hong Kong's inimitable appeal. I'm talking about our remarkable network of prized hiking trails. You can explore them in our 25 country parks, covering about 40 per cent of Hong Kong's total land area. Waiting for you, and your hiking boots.

  Trekking through trails, marked and unmarked, shares a good many similarities with what financial leaders – all of you here today – face every day in this time of geopolitical uncertainty, market volatility and headlong technological advance.

  I'm here to tell you that there's firm footing in Hong Kong, your steadfast partner. We offer certainty and clarity, together with confidence and opportunity, for global investors and businesses seeking to diversify their assets and minimise risks.

  For the next few minutes, allow me to put a spotlight on two elements of compelling interest to all of you here: our financial markets and fintech.

  Hong Kong's financial markets remain vibrant, despite the uncertain global outlook. Our stock market has soared over 30 per cent, year-to-date, while average daily turnover has exceeded 32 billion US Dollars, nearly double that of last year.

  In the first ten months of the year, Hong Kong recorded 80 initial public offerings, raising over 26 billion US Dollars. And that, I'm pleased to say, puts us No.1 in IPO(initial public offering) fundraising worldwide.

  To maintain the momentum, we're pressing ahead with reforms to the listing regime, enabling the financing of overseas companies, enhancing trading and risk management efficiency, and promoting the trading of stocks in Renminbi.

  In September, we published a Roadmap for the Development of Fixed Income and Currency Markets. It's designed to attract primary market issuance, boost secondary market liquidity, expand our offshore Renminbi business, and develop next-generation infrastructure.

  It will offer global investors more choices, as they seek to re-allocate assets, and help companies raise funds in these mutable times.

  Meanwhile, Hong Kong is poised to become the world's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre in the next few years. To fast track that development, we are enhancing the preferential tax regimes for funds, single-family offices and carried interest, to make the sector all the more attractive.

  We are also pursuing new growth areas, including building an international gold trading market. That rides on the substantial global demand for gold as a hedging investment product and reserve asset.

  Then there's financial technology. Blockchain and artificial intelligence are reshaping financial markets at an unprecedented pace. They can bring tangible benefits to financial markets and the real economy, enhancing efficiency and reducing transaction costs.

  Hong Kong is home to more than 1 200 fintech companies. In September's Global Financial Centres Index, we ranked No. 1, globally, in fintech.

  No surprise to the 37 000 professionals here from more than 100 economies, for Hong Kong Fintech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival, which opened yesterday. It is, by the way, the 10th anniversary editions of both international gatherings, drawing in fintech and startup enthusiasts to our enterprising city.

  In June, we published our second policy statement on digital asset development, a refreshed take on our determination to establish Hong Kong as a global hub for digital assets.

  We are working with our regulators on a future-proof regulatory regime, key to enabling the healthy and sustainable development of digital assets in Hong Kong.

  Licensing aside, our sandboxes allow promising fintech applications to be tested in controlled environments. Among them, Project Ensemble explores the tokenisation of assets, and the development of common industry standards.

  The Monetary Authority will promote live transactions of tokenised assets, exploring tokenisation's potential in digital trade and other areas.

  Trekking through shifting terrain is not a recommended solitary behaviour, for companies or for economies. It's why I'm grateful for the continuing support of market leaders – of all of you here today.

  Hong Kong was built on reaching out, on seeking international partnerships and mutual opportunities. Our unique ""one country, two systems"" framework enables that, allowing Hong Kong to reach out to a world of prospects, while maintaining unparalleled access to China, our country.

  I've just returned, this Sunday, from Korea for the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. There, I had the pleasure of representing Hong Kong, China, a full and separate member of APEC, and meeting and working with leaders from a world of economies, to advance the important cause of open trade and multilateralism.

  Later today, I will depart for Shanghai to attend the China International Import Expo. Also joining the Expo will be 380 Hong Kong companies, which will promote their products and services, and put a bright spotlight on the Hong Kong brand.

  The Shanghai trip will also mark the first major promotional event by the newly established GoGlobal Task Force. The Task Force will make it easy for Mainland companies to find foreign markets and global capital, as the world looks to our country for its quality products and services.

  In finance, the term ""leverage"" refers to the use of borrowed funds for further investments. Here in Hong Kong, we leverage more than funds. We leverage our financial prowess for the benefit of investors, economies and, importantly, humanity.

  I'm pleased to note that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) announced, just yesterday, that it will set up an office in Hong Kong. The AIIB is a multilateral development bank that supports developing countries in infrastructure improvements.

  As a committed member of the AIIB, Hong Kong will do all we can to support its establishment of an office here. That includes leveraging our vibrant capital markets, world-class professional services, and diversified products. We will also help the AIIB in project financing, bond issuance, investment management, and much more.

  These examples, ladies and gentlemen, are more than business missions, meeting dignitaries and commercial operations. They are ""one country, two systems"" hard at work. They are shining examples of how the principle – how Hong Kong – helps connect the world with the Chinese market.

  My thanks to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, this Summit's main organiser, and to each and every one of you for your invaluable presence.

  When you're here, do make the most of all that Hong Kong has to offer. That includes the scenic hiking trails I've mentioned. That also includes this very hotel we're at, which I'm glad to say has just been crowned No.1 in the World's 50 Best Hotels ranking. And our many Michelin-starred restaurants and award-winning bars – one of which came first in the World's 50 Best Bars last month, recognised as the world's best bar.

  Asia's best, world's best – all here for you to experience. To eat, drink, sleep, and spend some good time in. Some good money in!

  On that note, I wish you a rewarding Summit, an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, and the best of business and investment in the coming year.

  Thank you."

Hong Kong rose to rank fourth globally in digital competitiveness,2025-11-04 09:01,2025-11-04 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400203.htm,"  In the latest World Digital Competitiveness Ranking (WDCR) 2025 published by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), Hong Kong ranked fourth globally, up further by three places after rising by three places last year.

  Among the three factors in WDCR 2025, Hong Kong continued to perform well and remained third and fifth globally in ""Technology"" and ""Knowledge"" respectively, while our ranking in ""Future readiness"" improved notably by five places to tenth. At the sub-factor level, ""Technological framework"" and ""Adaptive attitudes"" ranked first globally. ""Talent"" and ""Training and education"" ranked among the top five globally.

  A Government spokesman said today (November 4), ""The IMD's WDCR 2025 continued to recognise Hong Kong as one of the most digitally competitive economies in the world. Our country supports Hong Kong to develop into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been striving to enhance the strategic layout of I&T infrastructure, with three major I&T parks and five key research and development (R&D) institutions as the framework, so as to actively drive I&T development and cultivate new quality productive forces. With the staunch support from our country and Hong Kong's international prospects, coupled with a thriving start-up ecosystem, a free, open and fair business environment, a simple low tax system and strong policy support, Hong Kong is well positioned to attract enterprises, talent and technology from around the world, thereby laying a solid foundation for further advancing the I&T collaboration and development.""

  The spokesman added, ""The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address a series of measures aimed at implementing the development of the international I&T centre. To promote R&D, the Government is taking forward the set-up of two pilot lines by the Hong Kong Microelectronics Research and Development Institute, and will complete the preparatory work for the establishment of the Life and Health Technology Research Institute(s) and the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute within next year. To accelerate the development of 'new industrialisation', we will expedite the development of the third InnoHK research cluster, relax the application threshold for the 'New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme' and launch the 'I&T Industry-Oriented Fund' in 2026-27. The Government will also continue to promote the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science industries, guided by the strategy of 'strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach', with a view to achieving 'industries for AI' and 'AI for industries'. On infrastructure, the computing power of Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre will be ramped up this year to meet the strong demand from sectors in Hong Kong, complemented by the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme that has been launched. The Government has also put up a site of about 10 hectares at Sandy Ridge in the North District for the development of a data facility cluster for open tender. On application, the HKSAR Government will continue promote AI business applications. Besides, the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone will commence operation this year, and the Conceptual Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San Tin Technopole will also be published this year. Going forward, the HKSAR Government will continue to promote closer collaboration among the Government and the industry, academia, research and investment sectors, consolidate and enhance our competitive edge in the global market, as well as foster the cultivation of new quality productive forces."""

CHP recorded another locally acquired case of chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-11-03 22:52,2025-11-03 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300875.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 3), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) has been recorded, which is classified as a local case. The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest case information
------------------------------
The case involves a 45-year-old male living in Kwai Tsing District and working in Sheung Wan. A preliminary investigation revealed that he developed a fever, joint pain and rash on October 30. He sought medical attention at a private doctor on November 1. He was referred to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Princess Margaret Hospital and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. He is in stable condition now. His blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. A preliminary investigation revealed that the patient had no travel history in the preceding three months (including the incubation period prior to onset). The case is classified as a local case.

The investigation also revealed that the patient did not visit Wong Tai Sin during the incubation period (i.e., the location of infection for the other two locally acquired cases this year). However, there is an overlap in the patient's residence and usual activity areas with individual imported cases. The CHP will carry out genome analysis to ascertain whether it has epidemiological linkage with the imported cases confirmed in Hong Kong earlier. Investigation is ongoing.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
--------------------------------------------------------------

In response to the new local case, the CHP today has conducted inter-departmental meeting with various departments and relevant organisations, including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and Kwai Tsing District Office (KTDO), to ensure that all units implement various preventive and control measures in a speedy and orderly manner. The CHP, together with the FEHD, have inspected various locations in the vicinity of patient's residence, conducted vector investigations and mosquito control operations to minimise the risk of local transmission.

 The CHP is implementing prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to five household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. So far, they are all asymptomatic. If necessary, the CHP will arrange for laboratory testing.

The CHP urged the residents living nearby Mount Haven in Tsing Yi, Kwai Chung Plaza and Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 1. The CHP officers and relevant District Services & Community Care Teams will contact residents living in relevant districts and remind them to take note of relevant symptoms and be aware of environmental hygiene in the household.

The CHP will set up health consultation booths at Kwai Fong Estate, Cheung Hang Estate and Sheung Wan tomorrow (November 4) to provide assessments to residents with relevant symptoms. Venues will be announced in the CHP's designated webpage. The inquiry hotline (2125 2373) set up earlier will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily.

The CHP will organise an online live seminarat 8.30pm tomorrow. Doctors will explain the latest situation of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents. The CHP will also collaborate with KTDO to organise health talks for the residents at the Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi at 3pm on Wednesday (November 5), which aims to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others. Details will be announced later.

The CHP will again issue letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to be vigilant. If there is any suspected CF cases, they should contact the CHP for follow up immediately.

On the other hand, the CHP continued to follow up the local cases in Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin. Starting from October 26 till now, the CHP has conducted assessments for about 11 000 residents through the health consultation booth on the second floor of Fung Tak Shopping Centre, its inquiry hotline and door-to-door visits in Fung Tak Estate. Among them, 40 individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests. As of 5pm today, 39 samples have completed testing and are all negative for the chikungunya virus. Besides, starting from tomorrow, the health consultation booth in Fung Tak Shopping Centre will change to operate from 9am to 1pm daily.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
 The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

 As of 5pm today, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 55 confirmed CF cases this year, including three local cases and the rest are imported cases.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
ã
The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生防護中心再錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案（附圖）,2025-11-03 21:50,2025-11-03 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300811.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月三日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案，屬本地個案。中心正聯同政府多個部門採取適當防控措施，致力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名45歲男子，住所位於葵青區，工作地點位於上環。初步調查顯示，他於十月三十日出現發燒、關節痛及皮疹，十一月一日向私家醫生求醫，被轉介到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，同日獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。初步調查顯示，病人在過去接近三個月並沒有（包括發病前的潛伏期內）外遊，屬本地感染個案。

此外，調查亦顯示病人在潛伏期沒有到過黃大仙（即今年另外兩宗本地感染個案的源頭位置），但其住所和日常活動範圍與個別輸入個案有重疊的地方。中心會對病毒進行基因分析，以判斷是否與本地早前的輸入個案有流行病學關連，調查仍在進行中。

政府全方位跟進
———————

針對新增一宗本地個案，中心今日已聯同多個部門和相關機構舉行跨部門會議，包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）和葵青民政事務處，確保各單位從速而有序地落實各項防控措施。中心亦已聯同食環署人員實地視察患者家居附近一帶的地點，進行病媒調查及滅蚊，減低本地傳播的風險。

中心已按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為個案的五名家居接觸者或共同暴露於感染源頭的人士提供醫學監察及健康建議。有關人士暫時沒有出現病徵。如有需要，中心會安排化驗檢測。

中心呼籲青衣曉峰園、葵涌廣場及上環信德中心一帶居民，如於十月一日後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛症狀的人士，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和有關地區的關愛隊會接觸居於有關區域的市民，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

中心明日（十一月四日）起會在葵芳邨、長亨邨和上環設醫護站，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估，地點會在中心網頁公布，而早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）會繼續由上午九時至下午八時運作。

明晚八時三十分，中心會舉行網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的病徵、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等。星期三下午三時，中心亦會和葵青民政事務處在青衣長亨社區會堂合辦教育講座，以期加深市民對這種蚊傳疾病的認識，一同參與防控工作，護己護人。詳情稍後公布。

中心會再次發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺，如有懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱個案，立即通知中心跟進。

另一方面，中心繼續跟進黃大仙鳳德邨的本地個案。由十月二十六日至今，透過設於鳳德商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話及於鳳德邨進行上門探訪，中心已為超過11 000名居民作評估，並已安排40名出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查。截至今日下午五時，中心已完成檢驗39名市民的血液樣本，全部對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。另外，由明日起，於鳳德商場的醫護站會更改為由上午九時至下午一時運作。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

截至今日下午五時，本港今年累計錄得55宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，三宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

The course, organised by the DoJ and held for the first time in Hong Kong, aims to deepen the participants' understanding of Hong Kong's legal system and strengthen legal exchanges and practical co-operation in the GBA.

 The Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan; Deputy Director-General of the Department of Justice of Guangdong Province Mr Chen Yongkang; and Deputy Director of the Legal Affairs Bureau of the Macao SAR Government Mr Iao Hin-chit, attended the opening ceremony this morning.

  Dr Cheung emphasised at the ceremony that in order to promote the construction of the rule of law in the GBA, personnel from the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao legal departments should have an in-depth understanding of the advantages of the three jurisdictions, and pursue joint development through enhanced understanding and collaboration. This is also the consensus of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Legal Departments Joint Conference.
ã
 Dr Cheung said the legal exchanges and practical co-operation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have deepened with fruitful results since the establishment of the joint conference mechanism. The training course, organised by the three places in rotation, is also a key training project under the joint conference mechanism. The first and second courses were held in Macao and Guangzhou in 2023 and 2024 respectively, while the third course is held in Hong Kong for the first time this year.

 Dr Cheung said that the three-day course in Hong Kong, organised by the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, had three features. First, the course would focus on core topics, covering the key elements and unique advantages of Hong Kong's common law system; and the administrative, legislative and judicial systems, as well as the law drafting and formulation process of the Hong Kong SAR Government. The lectures would be delivered by senior DoJ colleagues, public officers and industry experts with rich practical experience. Second, the course would cover a variety of visits, including visits to the legislature and law enforcement agencies, arbitration institutions and attendance in court hearings, enabling participants to understand first-hand the practice of Hong Kong's legal system. Third, the course would cover sharing of practical experience on specific topic. Representatives from Guangdong, Macao and Hong Kong will share their experience in promoting family mediation mechanism during sharing sessions on family mediation practices to promote in-depth exchanges and mutual learning between the three places at the practical level.

 He encouraged the participants to raise questions and exchange actively to deepen their understanding of each other's systems and practices.

Dr Cheung said that the Academy will continue to capitalise on Hong Kong's bilingual common law system and international status and provide platforms for capacity building, knowledge and experience sharing for legal professionals including those in the GBA, and contribute to the country's construction of foreign-related rule of law."

HKSAR Government welcomes implementation of new measures to support expansion of opening up and high-quality development by Mainland authorities,2025-11-03 20:22,2025-11-03 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300801.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR Government) welcomes the announcement by the Mainland authorities today (November 3) about a series of new measures to support high-level opening up and high-quality development. These measures include the expansion of application of the exit endorsement for talents to Tianjin, Hebei Province, Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province and Anhui Province, as well as all pilot free trade zones across the country with effect from November 5, 2025; implementation of ""facial recognition"" intelligent exit-entry clearance at various ports in the Chinese Mainland, including the Huanggang, Luohu, Liantang, Futian and Wenjindu Ports in Shenzhen, as well as the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Port; facilitating the efficient cross-boundary flow of production factors within the Shenzhen Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone (HTCZ SZ Park); and the addition of four ports connecting Hong Kong as the entry ports under the 240-hour visa-free transit policy.

The talent exit endorsement has been implemented in the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) on a pilot basis since February 20, 2023, with a view to facilitating specified categories of GBA Mainland talents' travel to Hong Kong for exchanges and visits. Its scope of application was expanded to Beijing and Shanghai in May 2024. As of October 2025, more than 74 000 arrivals in Hong Kong were visitors holding the talent exit endorsement. On the solid policy foundation of promoting ""southbound and northbound"" two-way talent flow, the current measure of expanding the application of the talent exit endorsement will attract and bring more Mainland talents to Hong Kong for exchanges, thereby enhancing Hong Kong's attractiveness in pooling talents and strengthening its unique role as the country's international talent hub.

On the other hand, theHKSAR Government also welcomes the implementation of ""facial recognition"" intelligent exit-entry clearance by the Mainland authoritiesat various ports in the Chinese Mainland that are open for navigation and passage with Hong Kong. This arrangement allows travellers to complete clearance without presenting their physical travel documents, making crossâboundary travel more convenient and efficient. TheHKSAR Government will continue to enhance clearance efficiencyat the control points in Hong Kong and improve visitors' experience, capitalising on these measures.

The HKSAR Government welcomes the implementation of a series of measures at the HTCZ SZ Park, which facilitate Hong Kong-Shenzhen innovation and technology collaboration and the efficient cross-boundary flow of factors of production. The Government will continue to actively collaborate with the Mainland authorities, including introducing innovative and convenient clearance arrangements at the Hong Kong Park, thereby promoting efficient and convenient cross-boundary travel for innovation and technology talents, and further contributing to the high-quality development of the GBA.

At the same time, the HKSAR Government also welcomes the Mainland authorities to further enhance the 240-hour visa-free transit policy by adding four ports connecting Hong Kong as the entry ports under the policy, thereby attracting international visitors to take Hong Kong as their entry stop or transit point in their multi-destination travel itineraries to our country, and fully leveraging Hong Kong's position as an international tourism hub.

The HKSAR Government will continue to maintain close liaison with the Mainland authorities, with a view to facilitating exchanges through more innovative policies and enabling Hong Kong to further integrate into the national development, thereby creating stronger impetus of growth for Hong Kong and the entire GBA."

Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency fosters printing industry to enhance new quality productive forces (with photos),2025-11-03 20:05,2025-11-03 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300588.htm,"Sponsored by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) under the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, The Hong Kong Printers Association (HKPA) today (November 3) staged an international summit and symposium to discuss the latest developments of printing standardisation and colour management, with a view to enhancing new quality productive forces in the printing industry. Certificates were also presented to 19 printing companies which completed the training and were accredited under the project sponsored by CCIDA.

CCIDA funded the HKPA to organise the Colourï¼Methodï¼Master: GBA ReCreates the World's Colour project last year to promote the ""Requirements for calculation and application of Colour Tone Value (CTV) in print workflow"" (CTV standard), which was steered and composed by the Advanced Printing Technology Centre of the HKPA, and expand the scope of its application through the CTV Pilot Scheme and Production of CTV Characterisation Dataset. The CTV standard was included by the Standardization Research Center for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in the list of GBA Standards in May 2025, making it the first GBA Standard for printing industry.

Speaking at the event, the Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau, acknowledged the efforts by Hong Kong, as one of the four major printing centres in the world, in contributing to the development of the country's printing industry. He said that Hong Kong has steered the first GBA Standard of printing industry which enables the printing companies in the country to have a more effective printing colour management standard and method of our own, thereby helping improve the printing quality.

At the CTV Certificate Presentation Ceremony, Mr Lau and Assistant Commissioner for Cultural and Creative Industries Miss Yvonne Ip, presented certificates of ""CTV Certified Printer"" to 19 printing companies from the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and Malaysia which completed the training under the pilot scheme. They will help promote CTV standard in China and overseas.

Also, the Production of CTV Characterisation Dataset recruited printing companies in the GBA to generate characterisation datasets by using the CTV standard on different printing materials to expand the scope of applications.

Apart from sharing by CTV certified printers, the Global Printing Standardisation and ICC Colour Symposium today also invited printing experts from the Chinese Mainland, the United States and Germany to introduce the latest developments of printing standardisation and colour management for GBA printing companies to further enhance their productivity and product quality.

In addition, the ISO/TC 130 39th Working Groups and Plenary Meeting will be held in Hong Kong from tomorrow (November 4) to November 8 with attendance of over 60 experts from around the world with an aim to promote the development and updating of international printing standards. The event is also sponsored by CCIDA.

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-11-03 20:01,2025-11-03 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300691.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (November 3) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From October 26 to November 1, the CHP recorded two LD cases. Both patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:

A 70-year-old male patient living in Kwun Tong District, classified as a community-acquired case.
A 69-year-old male patient who travelled to the Mainland during the incubation period, classified as an imported case.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these two cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of November 1, 137 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

â
âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-11-03 20:00,2025-11-03 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300686.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（十一月三日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十月二十六日至十一月一日期間，衞生防護中心錄得兩宗退伍軍人病個案，兩名病人均有長期病患，詳情如下：


70歲男病人，居於觀塘區，屬社區感染個案。
69歲男病人，於潛伏期內曾到中國內地，屬輸入個案。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這兩宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至十一月一日，今年錄得137宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

Speech by FS at Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit Welcome Dinner (English only) (with photo),2025-11-03 19:57,2025-11-03 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300759.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit Welcome Dinner today (November 3):

Deputy Commissioner Mr Hua You (Deputy Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Eddie (Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr Eddie Yue), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

   Good evening. It is a pleasure to join you tonight at the welcome dinner for this year's Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit.

   I hope you've brought your appetite. Tonight's carefully curated menu features a fusion of culinary cultures - a hallmark of Hong Kong's unique ability to blend the best of East and West.

  Of course, the essence of this evening lies in your presence, in the international diversity you represent, and in the breadth of insight and experience you bring to the Main Summit, tomorrow morning.

  This year's theme, ""Trekking through Shifting Terrain"", aptly captures the moment we're in. From trade to finance, from geopolitics to the global economy, we are navigating uncertain, often volatile terrain.

  But before we dive into tomorrow's full schedule, allow me to say a few words about the city that hosts you tonight: Hong Kong.

  For our financial services sector, it has been a rewarding year. By firmly adhering to the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong is shining as a preferred destination for global investors, and as a two-way platform for Mainland businesses going global and international businesses tapping into the Chinese and broader Asian markets.

 Our stock market has risen by some 30 per cent, on top of the 18 per cent increase last year. IPO (initial public offering) activity is leading the world so far, with a very strong pipeline. The asset and wealth management business is flourishing, as evidenced by the expansion of several global financial institutions in the city. In the bond market - such as green and sustainable bonds - Hong Kong stands as a regional leader in Asia.

  And from tokenised assets to stablecoins, Hong Kong's fintech sector is also making its mark - setting global standards and pioneering innovations that define the financial landscape of tomorrow.

  But Hong Kong is more than just a financial centre. We are building a new engine of growth powered by innovation and technology. We know for a fact that they are central to any economy's long-term competitiveness. They are central to a more diverse economic structure and thus the resilience of our economy, and instrumental to our commitment to inclusive growth. It is also important in the context of our role in the national development strategy of developing the GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) as an I&T (innovation and technology) hub.

  We focus on four strategic sectors: AI, biotech, fintech as well as new energy and new materials.

  The carrier of this vision is the Northern Metropolis.

  Occupying one-third of Hong Kong's landmass and adjacent to Shenzhen, the Northern Metropolis will become the innovation and technology hub of Hong Kong.

  As outlined in the Policy Address by the Chief Executive this year, we are accelerating development in this new land of opportunity. Two strategic initiatives characterise our approach.

  First, policy innovation. We are dismantling barriers and embracing bold and flexible development models - such as large-scale land disposals - to fast-track our land and infrastructure development with industry development. We are also proactively attracting top-notch global and Mainland enterprises to Hong Kong by offering tailor-made incentive packages.

  Second, cross-boundary collaboration with cities in the Greater Bay Area. As you may know, Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou together form the world's top innovation cluster according to the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization).

  In particular, our partnership with Shenzhen is deepening with greater impact. For example, in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Co-operation Zone along the Shenzhen River, infrastructure investments are ramping up. This zone will be a test bed for policy breakthroughs. That includes seamless cross-boundary flow of people, capital, goods, data and even biosamples. For example, the clinical trial institutions from both the Mainland and Hong Kong now established in the Zone will accelerate clinical trials, streamline regulatory approvals, and shorten the time to market for drugs and medical devices developed there. This is particularly attractive for global AI and biotech firms that rely on access to both Mainland and international data.

  We see tremendous potential for Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area to combine the best of both Silicon Valley and the New York Bay Area - where deep-tech innovation meets global financial and commercial connectivity.

  Ladies and gentlemen - whether you manage funds or sovereign wealth, scale unicorns, or steward generational legacies - I would say Hong Kong is a land of opportunities.

  Base your regional headquarters here. Meet your clients here. And grow with us here.

  My thanks to Eddie and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for orchestrating this landmark event, and to all our supporting organisations.

  Above all, my gratitude to each and every one of you for making this Summit one of the world's must-go gatherings of financial leaders.

  I wish you all flourishing business, enduring partnerships and a memorable stay here in Hong Kong.

  Thank you and bon appetit."

反非法勞工行動拘二十一人（附圖）,2025-11-03 19:43,2025-11-03 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300725.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月二十七日至今日（十一月三日），一連八日在全港多區展開代號分別為「促進行動」及「滙力行動」的反非法勞工行動。行動中共拘捕十九名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

反非法勞工行動中，入境處特遣隊人員搜查了四十一個目標地點，包括建築地盤及裝修中單位，共拘捕十九名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工全部為男性，年齡介乎三十三歲至五十八歲，均為內地訪客。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩名男子，年齡為三十六歲及五十三歲。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"
21 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-11-03 19:43,2025-11-03 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300721.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Contribute"" and ""Rally"", for eight consecutive days from October 27 to today (November 3). A total of 19 suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD Task Force officers raided 41 target locations including construction sites and premises under renovation. Nineteen suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers were all men, aged 33 to 58. All of them were Mainland visitors, which prohibit them from taking any employment. Two men, aged 36 to 53, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

Second Mainland and Hong Kong Housing Forum held in Hong Kong (with photos),2025-11-03 18:55,2025-11-03 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300661.htm,"The second Mainland and Hong Kong Housing Forum was held in Hong Kong today (November 3). Attendees included representatives from the Housing Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD), as well as representatives of various institutions and government departments in Hong Kong. Through thematic speeches and panel discussions, the forum further promoted the exchange of innovative housing practices to enhance living standards.

In her welcoming remarks, the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, shared about the unique housing ladder in Hong Kong and introduced the work of the Housing Bureau in areas such as housing construction technology, smart estate management, and the progress of implementation of the Basic Housing Units (BHUs) Ordinance. She pointed out that to improve the living conditions of the grassroots, the HKSAR Government is actively promoting the construction of Light Public Housing (LPH) units and long-term public housing. By leveraging innovative construction technologies, the HKSAR Government aims to build a large number of units in the shortest time and with the highest efficiency, targeting the completion of 30 000 LPH units and 169 000 public housing units within the next five years. Concurrently, the HKSAR Government will strengthen the application of technology and smart management, and promote the concept of ""Well-being design"" to create more liveable estate environments. Furthermore, the Housing Bureau is also improving the grassroots' living conditions through legislation regulating BHUs.

In his remarks at the forum, Deputy Director General of the Department of Standard and Norms of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Mr Wu Luyang stated that the Ministry is thoroughly executing the Central Government's policy decisions, earnestly implementing the spirit of the central city work conference, and implementing the requirements for building ""safe, comfortable, green, and smart"" good houses. Housing construction will focus on five key aspects: good standards, good design, good materials, good construction, and good service, to guide the innovation of the real estate and construction industries, thereby achieving transformational development in the sector.

After the forum, participants visited the Better Housing Exhibition on display at Sham Mong Road Playground. This exhibition is organised and instructed by the Centre of Science and Technology Industrial Development of the MOHURD, technically supported by the smart low-carbon construction technology innovation centre and whole-house smart key laboratory of the MOHURD, allowing participants to learn about cutting-edge technologies and their practical applications in the housing sector. They then proceeded to Hoi Tat Estate for a site visit to a public housing development project.

The HKSAR Government and the MOHURD have maintained close contact to exchange information and share knowledge on various housing-related topics such as smart construction, smart property management, community building, and housing policies. The inaugural Mainland and Hong Kong Housing Forum was held last year in Hangzhou to strengthen mutual learning experiences."

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (November 3) unveiled ""Fintech 2030"", a forward-looking strategy for driving Hong Kong's fintech development, at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2025.

Marking the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's flagship fintech event, the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2025, co-organised by the HKMA and Invest Hong Kong, represented a significant milestone for Hong Kong's fintech development. The event showcased transformative innovation and charted the direction for the future of fintech in Hong Kong. The event attracted global participants from around the globe to share pioneering ideas, exchange insights on fintech developments, and establish valuable business partnerships.

In his keynote speech, the Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,outlined the vision of ""Fintech 2030"" to make Hong Kong a robust, resilient, and future-ready fintech hub. The ""Fintech 2030"" will focus on four strategic pillars, collectively known as ""DART"", with a comprehensive portfolio of over 40 initiatives, including:


Creating Next-generation Data and Payment Infrastructure: The HKMA will develop robust and future-ready infrastructure to support secure, efficient and scalable data sharing as well as bolster cross-border payment connectivity, thereby creating new opportunities for all, from unlocking credit and boosting trade finance for enterprises, to enabling more personalised financial services and facilitating easier cross-border remittances for individuals.




A New Holistic ""Artificial Intelligence x Authorized Institutions"" Strategy (AI2 Strategy): The new strategy will further drive the comprehensive and responsible adoption of A.I. across the financial sector in Hong Kong and beyond, as well as develop shared, scalable A.I. infrastructure and finance-specific models in collaboration with industry stakeholders. By leveraging A.I., the HKMA aims to boost accessibility, responsiveness, and customisation in banking services while maintaining transparency and accountability to ensure public trust.




Enhancing Business, Technology and Quantum Resilience: The HKMA is taking proactive steps to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector, including a new fintech-specific cybersecurity certification framework and a new system of early detection through real-time analysis. In shaping the future of quantum finance, the HKMA will drive industry readiness for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and building quantum-safe infrastructure for secured financial services.




Tokenisation of Finance: To build a vibrant tokenisation ecosystem in Hong Kong, the HKMA will accelerate the tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), including financial assets, and lead by example by regularising the issuance of tokenised government bonds and exploring the concept of tokenising the Exchange Fund papers. Their settlements on blockchains will be enabled by new forms of digital money, including the e-HKD, tokenised deposits, and regulated stablecoins. The HKMA will soon launch the Project Ensemble pilot to empower real-value transactions and will continue to incubate innovative tokenisation use cases in collaboration with industry stakeholders and other central banks.


Mr Yue said, ""The power of collaboration, across public and private sectors, and across borders, has set the stage for even greater success on our journey towards 'Fintech 2030'. With a clear focus under the 'DART' strategy, let us join hands in reimagining the future of finance, opening a new chapter, and pushing the boundaries towards a more sustainable and inclusive fintech ecosystem.""

The full list of the initiatives under ""Fintech 2030"" will be updated on the HKMA website. Further details of the initiatives will be announced by the HKMA in due course."

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十一月三日）於香港金融科技周2025公布「金融科技2030」，以前瞻性策略推動香港金融科技發展。

香港金融科技周是由金管局與投資推廣署合辦，為香港金融科技業界的旗艦盛事。今年踏入十周年，更標誌着香港金融科技發展的重要里程碑。香港金融科技周除了展示香港在金融科技上的創新成果，亦探討香港金融科技未來的發展方向。這項盛事吸引了來自世界各地的參與者，分享前瞻思維，交流金融科技發展見解，並建立寶貴的商務合作關係。

金管局總裁余偉文在開幕致辭，闡述了「金融科技2030」願景，旨在將香港發展成為一個穩健、有韌性與前瞻性的國際金融科技樞紐。「金融科技2030」聚焦四大重點領域，統稱「DART」，涵蓋超過40個具體項目，包括：


構建新一代數據及支付基建（Data and Payment Infrastructure）：金管局將發展穩健且面向未來的基建，以支援安全、高效及可擴展的數據共享，並加強跨境支付互聯，在多方面創造新機遇，如為企業開拓信貸渠道、促進貿易融資，以及為市民提供更個人化的金融服務及更便捷的跨境匯款等。




支持業界全方位應用人工智能（Artificial Intelligence）：金管局將推出全新「AI2」策略（註），進一步推動香港以及其他地區金融業全面並負責任地應用人工智能。金管局將與業界合作，構建可共享和擴展的人工智能基礎設施以及金融業專用模型。金管局致力透過應用人工智能，提升銀行服務的普及、便捷及個性化，同時維持透明度與責任感，以維護公眾信任。




強化業務及科技韌性，並為量子電腦時代做好準備（Resilience）：金管局將採取積極措施，包括為金融科技網絡安全制訂全新的認證架構，以及透過實時分析建立新的預警系統，加強金融體系的穩健。在規劃量子金融的未來發展時，金管局將推動業界為「後量子密碼學」做好準備，並構建具備抗量子能力的基礎設施，以保障金融服務安全。




促進金融代幣化（Tokenisation）：為推動香港蓬勃的代幣化生態系統，金管局將進一步推進現實世界資產（包括金融資產）代幣化。金管局會帶頭為資產代幣化作示範，如將代幣化政府債券的發行恆常化，並同時探討外匯基金票據及債券代幣化的可行性。這些資產在區塊鏈上的結算將透過新型數碼貨幣實現，包括數碼港元、代幣化存款及受監管的穩定幣。金管局即將推出Ensemble項目試點計劃，以支持真實交易，並繼續與業界持份者及其他央行合作，培育創新代幣化用例。


余偉文表示：「公私營及跨境合作的力量，正為我們邁向『金融科技2030』之路奠下更堅實的基礎。秉持『DART』策略的明確方向，讓我們攜手重塑金融未來，開啓新篇章，突破界限，共同推動更可持續、更共融的金融科技生態發展。」

行政長官在2025粵港澳大灣區全球招商大會致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-11-03 18:00,2025-11-03 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300292.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十一月三日）在2025粵港澳大灣區全球招商大會的視像致辭：

尊敬的黃坤明書記（廣東省委書記）、尊敬的孟凡利省長（廣東省省長）、各位企業代表、各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家好。很高興通過視頻，參與今年的粵港澳大灣區全球招商大會。這次是粵港澳三地政府第四年攜手舉辦大會，匯聚全球企業，共創灣區未來。我首先對大會順利舉行，表示熱烈祝賀。

習近平主席指出，要使大灣區成為新發展格局的戰略支點、高質量發展的示範地和中國式現代化的引領地。在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，全面融入國家發展大局，主動對接粵港澳大灣區建設，是我們責任擔當、機遇所在。

香港不僅是大灣區的積極參與者，更是內聯外通的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」。香港是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，擁有完善法律制度和國際化的營商環境，全面服務灣區所需。我在新一份《施政報告》中，提出多項策略部署，深化灣區協同發展。我希望在這裏介紹幾個重點方向。

首先，北部都會區，是推動大灣區發展的橋頭堡。北都接壤內地，幅員廣闊，既推動香港創科和產業發展，也助力大灣區城市深化協同。我親自領導北部都會區發展委員會，提升決策層次，簡化行政流程，透過專項法例與創新模式，加速產業集聚，抓緊發展機遇。

第二，河套合作區，是大灣區創科的加速器。在最新公布的《全球創新指數》，「深圳－香港－廣州」創新集群首次位列全球第一，證明灣區創科實力世界前列。河套合作區憑藉「一區兩園」優勢，全力推動兩地創科發展。香港園區第一期首三座大樓已落成，不少新興產業租戶正陸續進駐。我們也會因應市場需求，考慮以一邊建設，一邊進駐的模式，提速提效，靈活為企業提供工作空間，提升灣區創科實力。

第三，發展新興產業，賦能灣區發展的新動力。我們會制訂優惠政策包，招攬更多高增值產業落戶香港，例如在生命健康領域，積極引進更多國際和內地頂尖藥企。我們也透過河套的大灣區臨床試驗協作平台，讓藥企在港深同步開展試驗。我們同時籌備成立國際臨床試驗學院，加快培育專才。

第四，推動企業出海，香港將發揮雙向平台的核心功能。全球對「中國製造」產品需求加大，內地企業正積極開拓新興市場。香港會驅動「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台功能，我們已在本月成立內地企業出海專班，服務企業在港設立財資中心和區域總部，通過香港專業高增值服務，與企業攜手拓展海外市場。

推廣灣區機遇，是香港連繫世界、促進共贏的平台作用。特區政府會繼續透過投資推廣署的泛大灣區外來投資聯絡小組，與大灣區城市的相關部門共同推展全面的聯合外來投資業務建議，在全球舉辦交流活動，鼓勵企業把握機遇，共同譜寫灣區故事的新篇章。

粵港澳同根同源，優勢互補。特區政府會繼續與大灣區城市同心並肩，譜寫新篇，共同釋放大灣區的巨大發展潛力。

最後，我祝願本次大會圓滿成功，大灣區發展欣欣向榮，在座各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"
"Property owner of Redhill Peninsula, registered minor works contractor and its authorised signatory fined over $400,000 in total for carrying out unauthorised building works",2025-11-03 18:00,2025-11-03 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300567.htm,"âAn owner of a detached house on Redhill Peninsula, a registered minor works contractor (RMWC) and its authorised signatory (AS) were convicted by the court for carrying out unauthorised building works (UBWs) in contravention of section 14(1) of the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123) (BO) (i.e. knowingly undertaking building works without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD)). After pleading guilty at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts last Thursday (October 30), the owner was fined $110,000, while the RMWC and the AS were fined $110,000 and $70,000 respectively.

The RMWC and the AS were also convicted by the court on the same day for carrying out UBWs at another detached house on Redhill Peninsula and were fined $70,000 and $45,000 respectively. Legal proceedings against the owner of the other detached house concerned are still ongoing.

The BD conducted a large-scale operation in September 2023 to inspect houses along the coastal area of Redhill Peninsula. UBWs were found in a number of detached houses, including the aforementioned two houses. Investigations by the BD found that the owners of the two detached houses, the RMWC and its AS had knowingly carried out the UBWs without the prior approval and consent from the BD, including adding structures to the garden, living room, bedroom floors and the rooftop, thus contravening section 14(1) of the BO. Hence, the BD instigated prosecution action against the owners, the RMWC and its AS under section 40(1AA) and section 40(6) of the BO respectively in August and September last year.

""The BD has already instigated prosecution actions against 30 detached houses on Redhill Peninsula. So far, 18 cases have been convicted by the courts for contravening section 14(1) of the BO. Court hearings for the remaining cases are being rolled out,"" a BD spokesman said today (November 3).

The spokesman said that property owners should consult building professionals before carrying out building works to ensure compliance with the BO.

Pursuant to section 40(1AA) of the BO, any person who knowingly contravenes section 14(1) (i.e. commencement or carrying out any building works without having first obtained approval and consent from the BD) commits an offence and is liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $400,000 and imprisonment for two years, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues.

The Government will submit a bill to the Legislative Council to amend the BO in the first half of 2026, which will include increasing penalties for offences against serious UBWs to enhance deterrence."

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天我很高興與大家聚首一堂，一同見證東九文化中心正式揭幕。其實我來這裏之前跟羅局長（文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩）說，以前我住在這裏附近，已經一段時間沒來，今次來到見到變了一座這麼漂亮的中心，我感受特別深。

東九文化中心是香港最新的旗艦表演場地，與坐落於尖沙咀的香港文化中心一樣，都是屬於全港性的大型表演場地。這座嶄新的文化地標，不單是特區政府推動文化藝術發展的重要里程碑，更是鞏固香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心很關鍵的一環。

東九文化中心的建築設計充滿心思，設計概念象徵一個文化的核心，同時融入了舊屋邨的社區元素，在現代設計中帶出昔日牛頭角屋邨的社區歷史記憶，真正做到新舊交融，傳承創新。

東九文化中心更是全港首個以「藝術+科技」為核心的表演場地，也是一個促進創新和交流的培育基地。中心擁有5個分別可容納120至1 200位觀眾的表演設施，配備多項先進舞台設備，全面支援各類型演出需要。

為支持業界創作更多優秀作品，中心特別將劇院預留作長期演出用途，讓標誌性的製作能夠長時間演出，推動演藝產業持續發展。這一點很重要，剛才我和羅局長亦有談到，有時有些表演投入很多金錢，有很多精美的布景等，所以長時間演出才能持續。

我要特別感謝所有文化界的合作夥伴。自去年八月以來，場館已成功舉辦了20套共500場的「東九開箱」試場節目活動，超過200位藝術及科技專才參與，吸引超過13 000人次觀眾入場。這些前期工作為中心的正式啓用打下了堅實基礎。

緊接下來為期三個月的開幕季，我們將呈獻一系列本地及國際精彩演出及藝術科技節目，包括無人機舞蹈、光雕投影等，突破傳統藝術疆界，為觀眾帶來全新體驗。

今個月可說是盛事連連，除了東九文化中心正式啓用，今個星期日還有第十五屆全國運動會開幕，多項精彩賽事將在香港賽區舉行，讓市民和旅客同時參與文化與體育盛事，真正體現「以文塑旅、以旅彰文」，帶動經濟發展。

特區政府會繼續支持文化、體育及旅遊的融合發展，積極推動盛事經濟。隨着啟德體育園、東九文化中心相繼啓用，加上快將落成的西九演藝中心，以及未來在北部都會區的文化設施，將會推動文化藝術創意產業的持續發展。

東九文化中心能夠順利啓用，需要各方眾志成城。而建設一個美好社區，同樣需要大家的支持。我相信大家也知道，立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，我在這裏亦必須一提，我鼓勵各位當日踴躍投票，選出有能力、有抱負的優秀人才，讓我們一起「投入選舉，共創未來」。

最後，我祝願東九文化中心運作順利，也邀請大家一同「走進東九」，共同「探索未知、點燃夢想、創造傳奇、連結世界」。

多謝大家！"

During the trip, Professor Lam briefed the Auditor General of the CNAO, Mr Hou Kai, who led the national delegation, on the recent work of the Audit Commission and shared with other members of the delegation the latest developments of the Commission.

  INCOSAI is convened triennially. Its 25th iteration was hosted by the Accountability State Authority of Egypt, with the themes ""The Role of Supreme Audit Institutions in Auditing Central Banks and Government Activities during Financial and Economic Crises"" and ""Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Auditing"". Participants included chiefs of supreme audit institutions of various regions and representatives of relevant regional bodies and international organisations. During the Congress, the representatives delved into issues such as emerging technologies, finance and economics in the context of auditing. The dialogue covered, among others, experiences in the application of artificial intelligence in the auditing workflow, as well as the role and scope of work of audit institutions amid economic crises. 

  Professor Lam thanked the country for its support and nurturing, which enabled the Audit Commission staff to take part in INCOSAI as members of the national delegation again and benefit from the exchange of professional knowledge with audit practitioners from across the globe. Professor Lam said that the CNAO, which was still in its founding stage when it joined the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions in 1982, has grown into an important member of the global authority. The CNAO's role is set to further develop as Mr Hou was elected during this Congress as Vice-Chair of the Congress for the upcoming term. As part of the nation's audit profession, the Audit Commission is deeply motivated by Mr Hou's election. Professor Lam remarked that the Audit Commission is committed to ""better integrating into and serving in the overall national development"", as stated in the Recommendations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and will, as always, deliver its best efforts in the local public sector auditing work and make active contributions to national development by leveraging the unique advantages and important functions of Hong Kong, which has the strong support of the motherland and close connection with the world."

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction. Any person who exports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is my honour to join you at the Biopharmaceutical Session of Global Bay Area Economic Forum 2025. On behalf of the Health Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, I extend my thanks to Our Hong Kong Foundation, the Guangzhou Institute of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the Macao Foundation for convening this meaningful dialogue.

In an era of complex global dynamics, the vibrant economic Global Bay Area clusters serve as engines of innovation and growth. Today, I will articulate the role and outlook of Hong Kong, not merely as a participant, but as a critical ""super connector"" within the biomedical innovation ecosystem of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

Just two years ago, in late 2023, the HKSAR Government articulated a clear and ambitious vision to develop Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. This was a strategic imperative, supported by our nation's 14th Five-Year Plan. This vision aligns perfectly with the decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, which emphasised deepening healthcare reform and establishing robust mechanisms to support innovative drugs and medical devices. The HKSAR is uniquely positioned to advance these national priorities, with our intrinsic strengths such as our international connectivity, rule of law, high-quality and efficient healthcare systems, robust data integrity, world-leading financial centre, and life-science research backed by two of the world's top medical schools.

  We are systematically transforming that vision into tangible reality in the GBA. A world-class biomedical innovation hub requires a world-class regulatory regime. We embarked on a landmark reform towards primary evaluation for medical products. Our first step was the launch of the ""1+"" mechanism in November 2023, which allows new drugs supported by local clinical data, to be registered in Hong Kong with approval from just one reference regulatory authority, instead of two. Today, we have already approved 15 new drugs under this mechanism, with seven of them being listed on the Hospital Authority (HA) Drug Formulary, bringing real benefits to patients.

In June this year, we announced a roadmap to establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation next year, with a view to establishing the centre as an internationally recognised regulatory authority for medical products. we will start implementing ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases. To further accelerate patient access to the most advanced treatments, we will also pilot a priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs recommended by the HA for treatment of clinically urgent, severe or rare diseases. Furthermore, the HA is establishing a dedicated Office for Introducing Innovative Drugs and Medical Devices. It will proactively facilitate the entry of innovative, cost-effective treatments into Hong Kong, ensuring our patients are among the first to benefit from global breakthroughs.

The Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI), which we envisioned in 2023, is now fully operational in the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone. Operating under the innovative ""one zone, two parks"" model with our Shenzhen counterparts, BAY TRIAL (Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trials Center) in Shenzhen park, the GBAICTI combines Hong Kong's world-class clinical standards, data integrity, and international recognition with the vast patient population and diverse disease profile in the GBA.

In May this year, the GBAICTI started a partnership with the medical faculties of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and the Chinese University of Hong Kong to provide comprehensive support for over 70 new clinical trial projects in the coming year. This will effectively consolidate Hong Kong's world-class research capabilities into a unified force.

At the same time, we establish collaboration across the boundary. In July, the GBAICTI signed a pivotal MOU with its Shenzhen counterpart, the GBA International Clinical Trials Center, or BAY TRIAL, and established a unified GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform. This platform streamlines matching services through artificial intelligence, provides a one-stop platform for applications, protocol approval and execution; and builds shared talent pools. This partnership has already yielded its first major project, a cross-border Phase II clinical trial for ICVAX, a therapeutic HIV vaccine co-developed by ImmunoCure and the AIDS Institute of HKU.

  The Real-World Study and Application Centre is set to launch by the end of this year. Its core function is to systematically harness the high-quality and comprehensive real-world data from Hong Kong's public healthcare system, which covers over 11 million patient records.

The Centre will provide robust real-world evidence to support multiple functions, such as to accelerate the development, regulatory approval, and market access of innovative medical products, particularly through data integration across the GBA. A key part of this strategy is the establishment of a unified GBA Real-World Data Platform, which will standardise and connect clinical data from both sides of the boundary, creating a seamless data ecosystem.

Ladies and gentlemen, the biomedical innovation landscape is rapidly evolving, and so are we. Over the past two years, we have systematically transformed vision into infrastructure, infrastructure into capability, and capability into tangible results - 15 new drugs approved, over 70 clinical trials in the pipeline, and a regulatory body ready to serve the region and the world. But our ambition extends beyond our shores. We envision Hong Kong as the nexus where Eastern and Western medical innovation converge.

For international companies, we offer a trusted gateway: conduct trials here under globally accepted standards with patients recruited from the 86 million population in the GBA. Our legal framework, intellectual property protection, and capital mobility provide the confidence needed for bold investment. For our nation's burgeoning biotech sector, we provide the springboard to the world: leverage our ecosystem to conduct international multicentre trials, access global capital markets, and use Hong Kong registration as your passport to international markets.

Hong Kong will continue to strengthen its role as the unparalleled ""super connector"" in the global biomedical landscape, building a healthier future for the region and the world. The Government's good efforts need the support of the community. The Legislative Council (LegCo) election day, the important day, will be on December 7 this year. We will be electing a highly competent and supportive LegCo for the new term. And hopefully, the new LegCo will work with the Government together and with all the stakeholders here to drive Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. Thank you so much and I wish you a wonderful afternoon. Thank you."
紅山半島業主、註冊小型工程承建商及其獲授權簽署人因僭建被法庭定罪和判罰款共逾四十萬元,2025-11-03 16:45,2025-11-03 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300546.htm,"​一名紅山半島獨立屋業主、一名註冊小型工程承建商及其獲授權簽署人，由於進行僭建工程，違反《建築物條例》（第123章）第14（1）條（即明知未事先獲得屋宇署批准及同意便進行建築工程）被法庭定罪。涉案人士上周四（十月三十日）在東區裁判法院均表示認罪，相關業主被法院判處罰款110,000元，而相關註冊小型工程承建商及獲授權簽署人則分別判處罰款110,000元和70,000元。

有關註冊小型工程承建商及獲授權簽署人於同日亦就其在另一幢紅山半島獨立屋進行僭建工程被法庭定罪，另分別被判處罰款70,000元和45,000元。至於檢控該幢獨立屋業主的法律程序仍在進行中。

屋宇署於二○二三年九月開展大規模行動，巡查紅山半島臨海一帶獨立屋，在多幢獨立屋發現僭建物，包括上述涉事兩幢獨立屋。屋宇署調查發現，該兩幢獨立屋的業主和註冊小型工程承建商明知未事先獲得屋宇署批准及同意便進行有關建築工程，包括在花園、客廳、睡房及天台等樓層加建若干搭建物，違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條。屋宇署遂於去年八月及九月分別根據《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條和第40（6）條對業主、註冊小型工程承建商及其獲授權簽署人提出檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（十一月三日）說:「屋宇署先後向紅山半島30幢獨立屋提出檢控，目前累計因僭建違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條而被法庭定罪的個案已有18宗，法院正陸續就餘下個案展開聆訊。」

發言人表示，業主在物業進行建築工程之前，應先諮詢建築專業人士的意見，確保建築工程符合《建築物條例》的規定。

根據《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條的規定，任何人明知而違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條（即在未事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，展開或進行任何建築工程），即屬犯罪，一經定罪，最高可處罰款400,000元及監禁兩年；及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。

政府明年上半年會向立法會提交草案，修訂《建築物條例》，當中會增加嚴重僭建物罪行的罰則以加強阻嚇力。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 31 to noon today (November 3), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 342 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

   The DEVB, being the party to procure services for public works, attaches great importance to the site safety performance of all construction sites under the purview of contractors on the List, regardless of whether the sites are public works construction sites or not. The DEVB issued a notification to the contractor concerned today to suspend it from tendering for public works contracts in the buildings category with immediate effect pursuant to the regulating regime. The contractor concerned has to conduct an independent safety audit to review its safety management system. Taking cognisance of the outcome of the independent safety audit, the contractor is required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures, with a view to demonstrating that it has an effective safety management system before the lifting of the suspension from tendering can be considered. The suspension from tendering is not only confined to tender exercises within the period of suspension from tendering, but is also applicable to tender exercises with procedures initiated but not concluded.

   The Labour Department is investigating this industrial incident and will handle it in accordance with the law. Subject to the investigation findings, the DEVB may impose further regulating actions on the contractor concerned later on, including extension of the period of suspension from tendering for public works contracts and even removal from the List."

Speech by FS at Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 (English only),2025-11-03 14:00,2025-11-03 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300413.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 today (November 3):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

I'm delighted to join you today, and I know we're all looking forward to the fireside chat with the group CEOs of two of Hong Kong's leading banks — a conversation that promises to be insightful and inspiring.

But before we begin, allow me to share some points about the Government's policy vision in driving forward fintech development in Hong Kong.

In the financial sector, we firmly believe that digitalisation is a transformative force that must be embraced. It enhances efficiency, reduces costs, enables more personalised services, and plays a critical role in promoting financial inclusion.

Technologies like AI and blockchain hold immense potential — from automating processes and improving credit assessments, to strengthening compliance and enabling near-instant, low-cost payments. But with these benefits come important challenges: algorithmic bias, data privacy, investor protection, and risks to financial stability. They must all be carefully addressed.

To fully harness the power of digitalisation while managing its risks, robust governance frameworks are essential. Just as important is close collaboration between the public and private sectors to drive innovation forward.

Allow me to share three key observations from our journey in building a vibrant fintech ecosystem.

Financial inclusion as an objective

First, the ultimate goal of financial innovation is to serve the real economy and improve lives. One of the greatest promises of fintech is promoting financial inclusion. And we believe that innovative solutions and stronger data connectivity through public-private partnerships are key to unlocking this promise

A great example is the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI) launched by the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) in 2022. It enables small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to share business data with banks on a consent basis, to facilitate faster and fairer credit assessments. Today, the CDI connects 17 data providers, including government agencies, and has already supported over 71 000 loan applications amounting to more than HK$58 billion. And we're not stopping there. Work is underway to expand its scope further to include more data sets and use cases, for example, bringing trade and logistics data into financing decisions.

Financial inclusion also means convenience. The Faster Payment System (FPS) is a case in point. It has not only transformed local interbank transfers but also gone cross-boundary. The FPS is now linked with the Mainland's Internet Banking Payment System as well as Thailand's PromptPay, enabling real-time, cross-border payments for users.

We're also empowering startups as drivers of inclusive innovation. With around 1 200 fintech companies in Hong Kong, we support their growth so they can scale their solutions and prosper.

For instance, through the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, we've invested in micro-lending platforms expanding into Southeast Asia, helping deliver inclusive financial tools where the demand is accelerating.

Regulators as enablers of innovation

The second observation is that regulators can and should be enablers of innovation. In Hong Kong, our financial regulators have a dual mandate — prudent regulation and market development facilitation.

For example, over the years, we've implemented a range of regulatory sandboxes that allow innovators to test new products in a controlled environment, receive timely regulatory feedback, and refine their solutions before going to market. These sandboxes foster collaboration between regulators and innovators, often leading to the co-creation of entirely new solutions.

One area where this is especially visible is tokenisation, which is rapidly gaining traction, enabling faster, more secure and more efficient transactions.

That's why Project Ensemble was launched last year — to explore tokenised assets, platform interoperability, and common industry standards. It's a collaborative effort involving both local and international players, and it reflects our belief that experimentation must evolve together with technology. I'm glad to note that Ensemble Pilot will be rolled out, enabling real value transactions in tokenised deposits and digital assets. And tokenisation is enabling a wealth of new investment products such as tokenised money market funds.

The Government is also leading by example. Our issuance of tokenised green bonds has not only set a market benchmark, but also encouraged broader adoption of sustainable digital finance.

Responsible and sustainable innovation

Third, responsibility and sustainability are vital in financial innovation — especially in areas like digital assets and AI. While we must encourage innovation, we must also ensure its real-world applicability, investor protection, and financial stability impact.

When it comes to regulating digital assets — whether digital asset trading platforms or stablecoins — we adhere to the principle of ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"". In particular, our regulatory approach to stablecoins is clear: they are not intended for investment, but rather as a tool to facilitate cross-border transactions and real-world economic activity. That's why, under our licensing regime, approvals will be granted only to applicants that demonstrate genuine use cases backed by sustainable and robust business model.

We take a similar approach with AI. As part of the Government's broader ""AI+"" strategy, we're embedding AI across sectors, attracting global talent and enterprises, and encouraging cross-sector collaboration.

But we also recognise the risks. Last October, we issued a policy statement on the responsible use of AI in financial services. It adopts a ""dual-track"" approach: promoting adoption while addressing risks like cybersecurity, data privacy, and IP protection.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, as we mark the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong FinTech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival, we're celebrating a decade of impact, ambition and bold ideas.

These two signature events have brought together visionary entrepreneurs, global investors, policymakers, and industry pioneers from around the world — all united by a shared belief: that technology can make finance more inclusive, more efficient and more human.

By having you all, and with our concerted efforts, I'm sure that Hong Kong will grow stronger as a vibrant, future-ready hub for fintech excellence.

Thank you."

他鼓勵學員積極提問和交流，加深對彼此制度和實務做法的理解。

張國鈞博士表示，香港國際法律人才培訓學院將繼續善用香港中英雙語普通法制度和國際化格局，為包括大灣區的法律界人士提供能力建設、知識和經驗分享的平台，貢獻國家涉外法治建設。"

Through her exquisite artistry, Yeung will reveal the multifaceted expression of guzheng. This highly anticipated collaboration is not to be missed by music lovers.

  In the first half of the recital, Yeung will open with the Henan zhang piece ""Song of the Homebound Fishermen"", performed with huqin artist Chan Pik-sum. She then will take the stage alone with the modern solo ""The Ballad of Lotus Flower"", followed by ""Qin River on My Mind"", a piece infused with Shaanxi tongzhou bangzi music elements, alongside celebrated pianist Colleen Lee. Subsequently, the three musicians will combine with percussionist Abby Chan to present the world premiere of ProfessorChan's new commissioned work ""Three Realms of Awakening"" - a three-movement pieces feature guzheng in dialogue with erhu, piano and percussion, showcasing the sublime harmony of Eastern and Western soundscapes with different perspectives in Buddhist iconography.

  The second half will feature two guzheng duets with Yeung's guzheng teacher Chin King, including ""Sound of Emerald"", which is inspired by tea-picking motifs, and ""Suo-Ma"", enhanced with percussion. In addition, Yeung will present the delicate Cantonese tune ""Lament in Autumn"" on a steel-string guzheng accompanied by Chan Pik-sum on theyehu. A highlight follows as Yeung will collaborate with Lee in the Hong Kong premiere of ""A Tender Dream"", a guzheng-piano duet that gracefully transforms jazz melodies into Eastern poetic tones, weaving an elegant cross-cultural dialogue. The recital will conclude with the duo performing ""Calming Storms and Waves"", ending the evening on a profoundly expansive and reflective note.

 Yeung is currently the Education University of Hong Kong's guest instrumental tutor. She holds a master's degree in music (zheng) from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts and is a music major graduate from the University of Hong Kong. Yeung received a gold medal in the 6th International Zheng Contest (Professional Youth Group), and was featured as one of the finalists in the Young Music Makers 2017 of RTHK 4. She was also invited to perform in Bali, Singapore and Macao, and has held various solo recitals at Tai Kwun, the Hong Kong Museum of Art, the Hong Kong Palace Museum and universities in Hong Kong.

Professor Zhang Xiang (President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong), Professor Zhang Bing (Founding Director of the HKIAA and Chair of Astrophysics, Department of Physics of the University of Hong Kong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to witness the inauguration of the Hong Kong Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics today. On behalf of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to the University of Hong Kong for reaching this significant milestone.

  Hong Kong has always been a place where curiosity meets opportunity. With the establishment of the HKIAA, we are taking a vital and visionary step to position our Hong Kong at the forefront of astrophysical research and technological innovation. Astronomy and astrophysics study the stars, planets, galaxies, and the universe itself, seeking answers to fundamental questions about dark matter, dark energy, black holes, the origins of the universe, and even the possibility of life beyond Earth. Addressing these profound mysteries requires brilliant ideas, advanced technology for developing state-of-the-art telescopes, and fruitful collaboration among scientists from diverse backgrounds.

  The HKIAA will serve as a dynamic platform where scientists, researchers and students from around the world can collaborate on frontier projects that expand our understanding of the cosmos. It will strengthen Hong Kong's role as a global hub for scientific excellence, attracting top talent and fostering partnerships with leading international institutions. It will also create unique opportunities to promote collaboration on emerging industries between Hong Kong and the Mainland, especially within the Greater Bay Area.

  Astronomy and astrophysics are deeply intertwined with the aerospace industry. The former inspires the scientific vision and theoretical foundation, while the latter provides the engineering solutions such as satellites, telescopes and probes, that make explorations possible. To promote the development of aerospace science and technology, and support space economy, the Hong Kong Space Robotics and Energy Centre has been set up under the InnoHK research clusters to support the country's Chang'e-8 mission. The Innovation and Technology Support Programme Special Call on Aerospace Technology has also allocated funding of more than $100 million to support six R&D (research and development) projects of universities.

  The establishment of HKIAA aligns with the Government's vision to cultivate a thriving I&T (innovation and technology) ecosystem and provides academic and R&D support to building a robust space economy in Hong Kong. It is not just an academic study, it is about igniting the spark of innovation here on Earth. I am confident that the HKIAA will become a beacon of knowledge and discovery, illuminating the path toward a brighter and more innovative Hong Kong.

  Last but not least, December 7 is a big day for Hong Kong. Please call on your family, friends and colleagues to vote at the Legislative Council General Election together, to create a brighter future for Hong Kong. Let us embrace this new chapter with enthusiasm and chart a bold course towards the stars.

  May I wish the first HKIAA Symposium a great success. Thank you."

Bonnie (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), Ms Bonnie Chan), Mary (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong and Greater China & North Asia, Standard Chartered, Ms Mary Huen), Amy (Co-Head of Wealth Management Asia Pacific, Head and Chief Executive of UBS Hong Kong, Ms Amy Lo), distinguished women chief executives from around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a true privilege to join you at the inaugural Women Chief Executives Summit, right here in Hong Kong.

  A very warm welcome to each of you - nearly 200 C-suite leaders from across the globe. Your presence here speaks volumes about the growing leadership of women in business.

  This first Summit arrives at the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration - a bold, visionary agenda for advancing women's empowerment. Three decades later, it continues to challenge us to ask: How far have we come? And what kind of future are we building?

  The theme of this Summit is a powerful and timely response, as we work together to build a future with greater inclusivity, driven by innovation and defined by impact.

Inclusivity

  No doubt, inclusivity is the bedrock of lasting progress.

  It is my firm belief that inclusivity is best manifested when people are judged by meritocracy, by their values, by content of their character, regardless of gender, race or background.

  The journey of women in Hong Kong has been one of accelerating achievement. Women now make up more than half of our population and are transforming every arena of society.

  As highlighted in the recent KPMG report in collaboration with WCE and the Women's Foundation, Hong Kong is making great strides in expanding gender leadership in finance. Since 2018, we've seen double-digit growth in female representation both in senior leadership roles and on corporate boards.

  And I'm also pleased to note that according to the report, Hong Kong ranks top for societal acceptance of female leaders, and some 70 per cent of women feel encouraged to lead. And we are doing well in safety as well as in infrastructure for enabling work-life balance, too.

  Now, more than half of our solicitors and professional accountants are women - a leap from just 30 per cent two decades ago.

  On our campuses, nearly 60 per cent of students majoring in business and management are women. These are not just statistics - they are the future market-makers, fintech innovators, and next-generation CEOs.

  Yet, the progress may be uneven. As your report shows, some industries are moving faster than others. I believe that the key to further improvement lies in providing equal opportunities and ample exposure for both men and women, allowing their potential to be fully unleashed and abilities properly recognised and appreciated.

  That is the direction that the Government is taking.

  Our ""She Inspires"" Mentorship Programme, launched earlier this year, is a good example. It aims at cultivating the next generation of women leaders. I am pleased to share that we have already matched over 80 aspiring female university students with some 50 of Hong Kong's most accomplished women leaders.

  I see many of the mentors here today - thank you for sharing your time, experience and wisdom so generously. You are shaping the leaders of tomorrow.

  And we are just getting started. As announced in the recent Policy Address, the programme will be expanded by 50 per cent next year, bringing the next cohort to 120 mentees. 

  But let us be clear: true inclusivity cannot be achieved by government alone. It demands a whole-of-society commitment.

  I'm encouraged by the progress we're seeing. A notable example is the HKEX's mandate to phase out single-gender boards. Today, nearly all listed companies in Hong Kong have at least one female board member.

  But this should not be a matter of checking boxes. It must be a recognition that diversity is strength, instrumental to sound governance, innovation and resilience.

Resilience and creativity

  This brings us exactly to the second point - the value that women can add to an organisation.

  The point I try to make is not to stereotype men or women. They both bring a wealth of perspectives that are shaped by their respective social, cultural and professional backgrounds and experiences. It is the combination of such perspectives and experiences that will give organisations a more complete approach to problem-solving, enabling better management and performance.

  Research consistently shows that organisations with diverse leadership, including women at the helm, are more agile, more empathetic, more creative and better equipped to achieve long-term success.

  Each of you in this room is living proof. I'm sure in the ensuing discussions many of you will be able to tell how gender-diverse leadership makes a real impact.

Closing: Lighting the way forward

  Ladies and gentlemen, as we gather here, I cannot better conclude than with a quote by Sheryl Sandberg, former COO of Facebook: ""In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.""

  On that note, I wish this Summit every success, and for all of you, the best of health and business. And by the way, please do mark your diary for December 7, LegCo Election. Thank you very much."

  On our campuses, nearly 60 per cent of students majoring in business and management are women. These are not just statistics - they are the future market-makers, fintech innovators, and next-generation CEOs.

  Yet, the progress may be uneven. As your report shows, some industries are moving faster than others. I believe that the key to further improvement lies in providing equal opportunities and ample exposure for both men and women, allowing their potential to be fully unleashed and abilities properly recognised and appreciated.

  That is the direction that the Government is taking.

  Our ""She Inspires"" Mentorship Programme, launched earlier this year, is a good example. It aims at cultivating the next generation of women leaders. I am pleased to share that we have already matched over 80 aspiring female university students with some 50 of Hong Kong's most accomplished women leaders.

  I see many of the mentors here today - thank you for sharing your time, experience and wisdom so generously. You are shaping the leaders of tomorrow.

  And we are just getting started. As announced in the recent Policy Address, the programme will be expanded by 50 per cent next year, bringing the next cohort to 120 mentees. 

  But let us be clear: true inclusivity cannot be achieved by government alone. It demands a whole-of-society commitment.

  I'm encouraged by the progress we're seeing. A notable example is the HKEX's mandate to phase out single-gender boards. Today, nearly all listed companies in Hong Kong have at least one female board member.

  But this should not be a matter of checking boxes. It must be a recognition that diversity is strength, instrumental to sound governance, innovation and resilience.

Resilience and creativity

  This brings us exactly to the second point - the value that women can add to an organisation.

  The point I try to make is not to stereotype men or women. They both bring a wealth of perspectives that are shaped by their respective social, cultural and professional backgrounds and experiences. It is the combination of such perspectives and experiences that will give organisations a more complete approach to problem-solving, enabling better management and performance.

  Research consistently shows that organisations with diverse leadership, including women at the helm, are more agile, more empathetic, more creative and better equipped to achieve long-term success.

  Each of you in this room is living proof. I'm sure in the ensuing discussions many of you will be able to tell how gender-diverse leadership makes a real impact.

Closing: Lighting the way forward

  Ladies and gentlemen, as we gather here, I cannot better conclude than with a quote by Sheryl Sandberg, former COO of Facebook: ""In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.""

  On that note, I wish this Summit every success, and for all of you, the best of health and business. And by the way, please do mark your diary for December 7, LegCo Election. Thank you very much."

Honourable Deputy Governor Lu Lei (Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr Lu Lei), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. A warm welcome to this year's Hong Kong FinTech Week and StartmeupHK Festival, running concurrently for the very first time - as we enter a new era of innovation.

  This strategic alliance, on the 10th anniversary of both flagship events, creates an unparalleled opportunity to amplify innovation, technology and global collaboration on an unprecedented scale.

  Your presence this week is equally unprecedented. This year's event is the largest fintech gathering in Hong Kong's history, bringing together more than 37 000 executives, 800 speakers and 700 exhibitors from over 100 economies. Networking never looked so good.

  Hong Kong is made for collaboration. Built for innovation, for companies, entrepreneurs, investors and professionals like you - each and every one of you here today and throughout this eventful week.

  Our unique positioning is well recognised by the world. In September, Hong Kong placed third, overall, and tops in Asia, in the Global Financial Centres Index. The Index also named Hong Kong's fintech hub number one, globally.

  Not surprising, given that Hong Kong is now home to more than 1 200 fintech companies, up 10 per cent from last year. Given, too, that our fintech sector is expected to exceed US$600 billion in total revenue by 2032, with a cheering growth rate exceeding 28 per cent a year.

  More good news. In September, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster finished first in the World Intellectual Property Organisation's top 100 innovation clusters - after placing second, overall, the previous five years.

  It helps, too, that we continue to attract talented professionals. Indeed, Hong Kong placed fourth, globally, and first in Asia, in the World Talent Ranking. That's up from ninth last year, and 16th the year before. And, let me add, Hong Kong finished number one in Asia, and world's best in the percentage of science graduates.

  In this year’s World Investment Report, released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, our city moved up to third place, overall, in foreign direct investment inflows.

  And, as you know, it’s been a banner year for initial public offerings (IPO) here in Hong Kong. In the first nine months of the year, IPO fundraising had surpassed US$23 billion, underlining and bold-facing Hong Kong's revitalised status, as the world's premier listing and capital-raising venue.

  These and other international kudos reflect Hong Kong's status as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"". We help to link the markets from China, our country, with those around the globe. We help start-ups go from local prototypes to global success.

  Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong draws opportunities from both our country and the world. This dual advantage drives our connectivity and development.

  From January 2023 to September 2025, Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), our dedicated investment promotion agency, has helped more than 1 400 overseas and Mainland companies establish or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. They have brought in more than US$24 billion in foreign direct investment, creating some 20 000 jobs within the first year of their operation or expansion.

  This week, we are welcoming more than 30 Mainland and international delegations here for Fintech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival. Tomorrow, the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit returns, bringing together some 300 global financial leaders, including over 100 group chairmen or CEOs.

  Hong Kong's role in connecting Mainland and international markets has never been clearer.

  In my recent Policy Address, delivered in September, I introduced a series of initiatives to drive growth and strengthen Hong Kong's competitiveness.

  To cement our status as an international financial centre, we will deepen the equity market and expand world-class bond currency markets, while advancing the insurance and asset and wealth management sectors.

  In equities, we will support technology companies from the Mainland in fundraising, encourage overseas enterprises to pursue secondary listings here, and welcome the return of China Concept Stock companies from overseas markets, with Hong Kong as their preferred destination.

  We are committed to enhancing bond market infrastructure, establishing connections with overseas markets such as Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

  Hong Kong is proud to be the world's largest offshore Renminbi hub. We will continue to support its growing use in our economy. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will make use of the Currency Swap Agreement with the People's Bank of China to give companies longer-term Renminbi financing for trade, operations and capital expenditure.

  To strengthen asset and wealth management, we will enhance preferential tax regimes for funds, single-family offices and carried interest. The Capital Investment Entrant Scheme will also be relaxed to encourage more investors.

  In fintech, our Monetary Authority's Project Ensemble is exploring tokenisation in conventional finance, while applying the supervisory sandbox to boost innovation under prudent risk management.

  We are also accelerating the transformation of innovation and technology, focusing on key sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI), life and health sciences, new energy and aerospace.

  From building AI research clusters and enabling cross-boundary clinical trials to advancing hydrogen infrastructure, our goal is to help emerging industries scale and thrive.

  At the same time, we are strengthening collaboration with the Mainland to build a green and sustainable finance market supporting long-term development.

  We are committed to contributing to national development while deepening international exchanges and co-operation.

  The GoGlobal Task Force, announced in my latest Policy Address, was launched last month. It is designed to help Mainland businesses expand overseas using Hong Kong as their springboard. Working with InvestHK, our Economic and Trade Offices, the Trade Development Council and other governmental agencies, GoGlobal will smooth the way for Mainland companies to find foreign markets and global capital. Plenty of opportunities there for all concerned.

  In short, ladies and gentlemen, the future is bright for Hong Kong and the companies, investors and talent that work with Hong Kong.

  This year's anniversary editions of Hong Kong FinTech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival will give you a jump-start on the promising future of co-operation. This flagship event, very much like Hong Kong, connects you with a world of promising opportunities, together with the latest insights, intelligence and innovative technology.

  The main conference, today and tomorrow, features 11 targeted forums ranging from health and Insurtech to digital finance and assets, blockchain, AI, a China-Global Innovation Forum and more. And the international exhibition area spotlights finance, fintech and other advanced technology.

  I am grateful to the organisers - the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, and Invest HK, among others - together with our many supporters, for staging this vital global gathering over the past 10 years. A decade of success.

  And while you're here, with us, I urge you to invest some time exploring Hong Kong, the world's rising East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange - and good times.

  I wish you all a rewarding week and the best of fintech, start-ups and investment in the coming year.

  Thank you."

Ombudsman announces results of full investigation into mechanism regulating illegal bicycle parking caused by bicycle rental shops (with photos),2025-11-03 11:00,2025-11-03 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025103100796.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (November 3) announced the completion of a full investigation into the mechanism regulating illegal bicycle parking caused by bicycle rental shops.

The Government addresses the problem of illegal bicycle parking by having member departments of the local Working Group on Tackling Illegal Bicycle Parking, which includes the District Office (DO) of the Home Affairs Department (HAD), the District Lands Office (DLO) of the Lands Department, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and the Transport Department (TD), exercise their respective powers under the law, depending on the location and condition of the bicycles, to conduct interdepartmental joint operations as necessary to remove bicycles illegally parked on government land in accordance with established procedures. Upon receiving complaints about illegal bicycle parking, the DLO, the FEHD, and the TD refer them to the DO for follow-up in accordance with the Working Group's guidelines on joint operations for clearing illegally parked bicycles (Operation Guidelines). Joint operations are carried out by the Working Group under the co-ordination of the relevant DO.

Mr Chan said, ""The Office of The Ombudsman notes that some bicycle rental shops in Shatin persistently placed a large number of bicycles along the pedestrian walkways outside the shops (the Location), obstructing pedestrians and even posing safety concerns. The complainant notified HAD in May 2024, requesting that it take follow-up action in collaboration with other relevant departments, but the departments failed to properly address the illegal bicycle parking caused by the rental shops such that the problem persisted.

""The Office's investigation found that the Working Group had indeed established Operation Guidelines to address illegal bicycle parking, and its member departments had also exercised their powers under the law to conduct joint operations in accordance with these guidelines and established procedures. In response to the complaint, the Working Group carried out six joint operations between July 2024 and June 2025, during which nearly 1 000 statutory notices were posted and illegally parked bicycles were cleared. Following our inquiry, the Working Group specifically increased the frequency of joint operations at the Location from an average of once every two months to once a month, starting in June 2025. As a further step in addressing the problem, the Working Group identified and compiled a list of blackspots, and intensified joint operations at severely affected locations. Since August 2025, the DO has been installing signage at the blackspots within the District to remind shop operators and related parties to exercise self-discipline, raise law-abiding awareness, and comply with bicycle parking regulations.

""However, our investigation revealed that both before and after the joint operation, over 100 bicycles remained parked at the Location, indicating the persistent severity of illegal bicycle parking there. The improvement was short-lived during the enforcement period by the relevant departments, with the problem of illegal parking soon recurring,"" said Mr Chan.

""The Office considers the problem of illegal bicycle parking in Hong Kong has not been thoroughly resolved. The departments should further strengthen and implement the spirit of interdepartmental collaboration with the shared goal of addressing the issue seriously and genuinely. Regarding illegal bicycle parking, the Office has made 17 improvement recommendations for the Working Group. The Working Group has accepted all of them and will implement our recommendations.""

The recommendations for improvement include:

• continue interdepartmental collaboration and closely monitor illegal bicycle parking;

• continue conducting large-scale joint operations at the Location at least once a month;

• consider increasing the frequency of reviews on the effectiveness of joint operations from a biannual to a quarterly or even monthly basis, and adjust enforcement strategies as needed;

• during routine patrols, promptly clear or at least prioritise the removal of illegally parked bicycles that severely obstruct pedestrian walkways or pose a danger to pedestrians;

• explore the introduction of innovative smart surveillance systems, including the pilot installation of AI-enabled cameras at the Location to identify illegally parked bicycles, with a view to enhancing enforcement effectiveness;

• consider increasing the number of bicycle parking places or expanding existing facilities near the Location to better accommodate the parking needs of the public and the rental shops;

• drawing on management practices for car parks, explore the feasibility of implementing double-deck parking racks at bicycle parking places; and

• enhance communication and consultations with shop operators at the Location, and also solicit their views and explore concrete and effective improvement measures to address illegal parking.

The full investigation report has been uploaded to the website of the Office of The Ombudsman at www.ombudsman.hk for public information."

申訴專員陳積志今日（十一月三日）宣布公署完成政府就單車租賃店鋪違泊單車問題的規管機制的全面調查。

政府就處理違例停泊單車的問題，相關地區的處理違例停泊單車工作小組內各部門包括民政事務總署（民政總署）轄下的分區民政事務處（民政處）、地政總署轄下的分區地政處（地政處）、食物環境衞生署（食環署）及運輸署，會因應單車的停泊位置及情況，根據法例賦予的權力和既定程序，適時採取跨部門聯合行動，清理在政府土地上違泊的單車。如接獲有關單車違泊的投訴，地政處、食環署及運輸署會轉介民政處根據工作小組有關清理違例停泊單車的聯合行動指引處理，由當區民政處統籌工作小組進行聯合行動。

陳積志表示：「公署留意到，沙田區有單車租賃店鋪長期把大量單車放置在店鋪外的行人通道（事涉地點），對行人構成阻礙甚至潛在安全隱患。申訴人自二○二四年五月向民政總署投訴，要求該署聯同相關政府部門採取跟進行動。然而，申訴人指問題並無改善，並認為各部門沒有妥善處理單車租賃店鋪的違泊情況。」

「公署調查發現，工作小組確實已就這宗申訴的事涉地點制訂行動指引，處理單車違泊的問題，而各部門亦已按行動指引的規定，根據法例賦予的權力和既定程序採取聯合行動。就申訴人的投訴，由二○二四年七月至二○二五年六月，工作小組進行了六次聯合行動，在現場張貼總共近千張法定通知及清理違泊單車。在公署展開查訊後，工作小組更特別增加於事涉地點進行聯合行動的頻次，自二○二五年六月起，由平均每兩個月一次增加至每月一次。工作小組亦有制訂違泊黑點，針對違泊嚴重的地點增加聯合行動。民政處更進一步由二○二五年八月起，陸續在當區的違泊黑點安裝告示牌，提醒商戶及有關人士自律及加強守法意識，不要違規停泊單車。」

「然而，公署調查發現，在工作小組採取聯合行動前和行動後，事涉地點仍然放置逾百輛單車，顯示該處的單車違泊情況確實持續嚴重。有關問題只是在相關部門執法期間得到短暫改善，不久違泊問題便故態復萌。」

「公署認為在香港各處單車違泊問題並未徹底解決，各部門應更進一步全面實踐和落實跨部門協作的精神，以認真和真正解決單車違泊問題為共同目標。就單車違泊情況，公署對工作小組提出了17項改善建議。工作小組接受並會落實公署的所有建議。

公署提出的主要改善建議包括：

• 繼續進行跨部門協作，緊密監察單車違泊情況；

• 在事涉違泊地點持續執行每月至少一次的大規模聯合行動；

• 考慮由以往每半年加強至每季甚至每月在聯合行動後檢討成效，並在有需要時適當地調整執法策略；

• 在日常巡查中，如發現有嚴重阻礙行人通道或對行人構成危險的情況，考慮即時或至少優先清理違泊的單車；

• 研究引入創新科技智能監察系統，試驗在事涉地點安裝智能鏡頭，利用人工智能辨識違規停泊單車，提升執法成效；

• 考慮在事涉地點附近增加或擴闊現有的單車泊車處，便利有需要的巿民和店鋪使用；

• 參考汽車停車場的管理，研究在單車泊車處採用雙層泊架的可行性；以及

• 加強與當區商戶的溝通及諮詢，亦要聽取營運者的意見，研究就違泊情況制訂具體及有效的改善方案。
