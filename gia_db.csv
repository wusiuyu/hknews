政府修訂政府資助專上課程學額和資助申請資格,2025-07-31 13:30,2025-07-31 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100288.htm,"政府今日（七月三十一日）公布有關政府資助專上課程學額和資助申請資格的修訂：設立兩個學費類別，並修訂有關申請資格準則。有關修訂適用於二○二七／二八及以後學年（二○二七／二八學年的申請周期於二○二六年十月開始），讓受影響人士有合理時間自行作出規劃，並讓大學聯合招生處和各院校（包括大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學、香港演藝學院和職業訓練局）入學事務處有足夠時間作相應的行政安排。

政府發言人說：「根據現行收生安排，獲入境事務處（入境處）首次簽發受養人簽證／進入許可時未年滿18歲的學生，均列為本地學生。近期有意見關注部分學生並無來港居住，卻以本地學生身分申請教資會資助大學的政府資助學額，影響了升讀大學的機會及公帑運用的準確性。」

「為了釐清政府資助專上課程學額和資助申請資格，確保公帑用得其所，教育局考慮海外做法和香港實際情況，認為受養子女須居港滿兩年才符合資格申請政府資助專上課程學額。至於持有全職工作簽證／工作許可證或各項入境計劃下的簽證／進入許可的人士，將不再符合資格申請政府資助專上課程學額。」

有關修訂設立兩個學費類別。第I類別為獲資助的學費。持有下列文件的人士符合資格申請副學位、學士學位及研究院修課課程的政府資助學額：


香港永久性居民身份證、由入境處簽發並顯示持有人享有香港的入境權／居留權的其他文件，以及無條件限制逗留簽證標籤；
單程證；以及
受養人簽證／進入許可：持有人首次獲入境處簽發有關文件時未滿18歲，並須在緊接所修讀課程開課首天前的兩年內居住於香港。就第一年學額而言，為配合院校收生程序，該兩年期將由大學聯合招生處或相關院校按所修讀課程開課首天的日期而適當指明。符合居港規定與否，會在每個學年開始時或之前評定，並在該學年的餘下時間維持不變，而課程學年的首天是按該課程的開課日而定。


第II類別為不獲資助的學費，適用於不符合上述第I類別資格準則的人士，包括：


首次獲入境處簽發受養人簽證／進入許可時未滿18歲、並且不符合兩年居港規定的受養人簽證／進入許可持有人；
全職工作簽證／工作許可證持有人；
各項入境計劃下的簽證／進入許可持有人（包括優秀人才入境計劃、資本投資者入境計劃或輸入中國籍香港永久性居民第二代計劃）；以及
非本地學生（例如：學生簽證／進入許可持有人、非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排下的簽證／進入許可持有人、首次獲入境處簽發受養人簽證／進入許可時年滿18歲或以上的受養人簽證／進入許可持有人）。


第II類別人士仍可以申請報讀政府資助副學位、學士學位及研究院修課課程，惟須繳付不獲資助的學費。就不獲資助的學費水平，院校可根據既定原則，因應本身情況及課程成本，綜合考慮各種因素，自行釐訂合適的學費水平，並須收取至少足以收回所有額外直接成本的學費。相關學費水平須與非本地學生的學費水平一致。

政府會就上述修訂設立過渡安排，即在二○二七／二八學年（申請周期於二○二六年十月開始）的居港規定設為一年，二○二八／二九學年起才實行兩年的居港規定。

發言人說：「政府在制訂有關修訂時，已充分聽取社會不同意見，並取得適當平衡，相信有關修訂對真正有意來港發展的家庭影響不大。」

就居港規定而言，根據大學聯合招生辦法申請第一年學士學位課程的政府資助學額，申請人須提交以下證明﹕

（一）申請人須提供證明，顯示自己在計至所修讀課程開課當年的五月三十一日為止的兩年期內以全日制學生身分於本港開辦正規課程的學校就讀；或

（二）未能提供上文（一）項所述證明的申請人，可向入境處付費申領涵蓋該段兩年期的出入境紀錄證明，以顯示申請人在該段兩年期內，每年不多於90天不在香港。

至於其他政府資助專上課程的學額，包括教資會資助大學的副學位、高年級學士學位及研究院修課課程的政府資助學額，相關院校在審批有關申請時，亦須採取類似上文所述的做法。

以「本地學生」和「非本地學生」的定義作為基礎的政府獎學金、研究生獎學金或政府資助計劃（例如：「香港未來人才深造獎學金計劃」、「本地研究生學費豁免計劃」、「指定專業／界別課程資助計劃」，以及「為修讀香港自資學士學位課程學生提供的免入息審查資助計劃」）的申請資格準則及相關安排會作相應修訂，以確保處理方法一致。"
Government revises eligibility criteria for government-subsidised post-secondary student places and subsidies,2025-07-31 13:30,2025-07-31 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100290.htm,"  The Government today (July 31) announced the revision of the eligibility criteria for government-subsidised post-secondary student places and subsidies: introducing two categories of tuition fees and revising the eligibility criteria. The revision will apply to the 2027/28 academic year and thereafter (the application cycle for the 2027/28 academic year commencing in October 2026). This will allow the affected persons reasonable time to make their own plans and the Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS) Office and the admissions offices of various institutions (including the University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities, the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, and the Vocational Training Council) sufficient time to make corresponding administrative arrangements.

 A Government spokesperson said, ""Under the current admissions arrangements, dependant visa/entry permit holders who were below 18 years old when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the Immigration Department (ImmD) are considered local students. There has been recent concern that some of these students did not come to reside in Hong Kong but applied for government-subsidised student places at UGC-funded universities as local students, which affected opportunities for university admission and the targeted use of public funds.

  ""To clarify the eligibility criteria for government-subsidised post-secondary student places and subsidies, and to ensure the proper use of public funds, the Education Bureau, having regard to overseas practices and the practical situation in Hong Kong, considers it necessary for dependant children to reside in Hong Kong for two years before becoming eligible for government-subsidised post-secondary student places. Holders of a full-time employment visa/work permit or a visa/entry permit for various admission schemes will no longer be eligible for government-subsidised post-secondary student places.""

  Two categories of tuition fees are introduced under the revision. Category I refers to subsidised fees. Persons holding the following documents are eligible for government-subsidised student places in relation to sub-degree, undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes:


A Hong Kong permanent identity card, other documents issued by the ImmD showing the right to land/right of abode in Hong Kong, and a visa label for unconditional stay;
A One-way Permit for entry to Hong Kong; and
A dependant visa/entry permit: holders who were below 18 years old when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the ImmD, provided that they have resided in Hong Kong for two years immediately preceding the first day of their respective programmes. Regarding first-year student places, to facilitate institutions'admissions procedures, the two-year period will be specified appropriately by the JUPAS office or the institutions concerned having regard to the first day of the respective programmes. Whether the residency requirement is met is determined at or before the start of each academic yearand shall remain the same for the remainder of that academic year. The first day of the academic year of a programme is determined by the programme's start day.


  Category II refers to non-subsidised fees and applies to persons not meeting the eligibility criteria in the above-mentioned Category I. These persons include:


Dependant visa/entry permit holders who were below 18 years old when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the ImmD, and they do not meet the two-year residency requirement;
Holders of a full-time employment visa/work permit;
Holders of a visa/entry permit for various admission schemes (including the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme or the Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents); and
Non-local students (such as holders of a student visa/entry permit; holders of a visa/entry permit under the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates; dependant visa/entry permit holders who were 18 years old or above when first issued with such visa/entry permit by the ImmD).


  Category II persons may still apply for government-subsidised sub-degree, undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes but have to pay non-subsidised fees. The institutions may determine appropriate non-subsidised fee levels, following the established principles, having regard to their own circumstances and programme costs, and taking a holistic view of various factors. The levels have to be at least sufficient to recover all additional direct costs, and to be on par with those applicable to non-local students.

  The Government will put in place a transitional arrangement for the above-mentioned revision, whereby the residency requirement for the 2027/28 academic year (its application cycle commencing in October 2026) will be set at one year. The two-year residency requirement will be implemented starting from the 2028/29 academic year.

 The spokesperson said, ""When formulating the revision, the Government fully listened to various views in society and struck the right balance. The revision is not expected to have a significant impact on families with genuine intentions to come to Hong Kong for development.""

 Regarding the residency requirement for JUPAS applications for government-subsidised first-year-first-degree student places, applicants are required to provide the following proof:

(a) proof from the applicant that he or she is enrolled as a full-time student in a school offering a formal curriculum in Hong Kong for the two-year period ending on May 31 in the year in which his or her respective programme begins; or

(b) for those who cannot provide the proof in (a) above, a statement of travel records of the applicant which can be obtained at a fee from the ImmD covering the two-year period to demonstrate that the applicant is not absent from Hong Kong for a maximum of 90 days in each year of the two-year period.

  Regarding other government-subsidised post-secondary student places, including those in relation to sub-degree, senior year undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes of UGC-funded universities, the relevant institutions are required to process the applications in an approach similar to the above-mentioned one.

  The eligibility criteria and related arrangements for government scholarship, fellowship or subsidy schemes which are currently premised on the definitions of ""local students"" and ""non-local students"" (such as the Hong Kong Future Talents Scholarship Scheme for Advanced Studies, the Tuition Waiver for Local Research Postgraduate Students, the Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors, and the Non-means-tested Subsidy Scheme for Self-financing Undergraduate Studies in Hong Kong) will also be correspondingly revised to ensure consistency."
立法會：商務及經濟發展局副局長就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-31 13:03,2025-07-31 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100389.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局（商經局）副局長陳百里博士今日（七月三十一日）在立法會會議上，就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案的總結發言：

主席：

我再次感謝容海恩議員提出的動議，田北辰議員、陳曼琪議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案，以及其他共41位議員就積極拓展香港新經濟增長點的寶貴建議。以下我會作綜合回應。

加強內聯外通、招商引資

首先，我留意到很多議員都希望政府加強內聯外通方面的工作，以及進一步向海內外宣傳我們方方面面的優勢，說好香港故事。

事實上，政府一直透過不同措施提升香港的國際競爭力和吸引力。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港整體排名晉身全球首三位最具競爭力的經濟體，在「商業法規」和「稅務政策」排名更是全球第一。今次是自二○一九年後，香港首次重返全球三甲，顯示政府的施政方向整體正確，各項政策取得了成效。尤其在招商引資方面，在二○二三年至二○二五年上半年期間，投資推廣署已協助約1300間企業在港開設或擴展業務，預計帶來直接投資額超過1,600億元，並在有關企業設立或擴展業務的首年，合共創造超過19 000個職位。以上數字已超越二○二二年《施政報告》所訂的績效指標。我們會繼續加強宣傳香港的獨特優勢及新經濟增長點帶來的機遇。

而在深化與內地的聯繫方面，因應內地市場對香港的專業服務需求日漸增加，政府會繼續把握《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）下內地給予香港的優惠措施，助力香港企業和專業人才為內地市場提供優質產品和服務。例如，在CEPA框架下簽訂的《修訂協議二》增加了「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」作為便利香港投資者的措施，正好支持在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）試點城市註冊的港資企業。此外，大灣區市場在多個範疇以先行先試的方式對香港作更大程度開放，讓香港服務提供者在大灣區市場提供更多樣化的專業服務，為香港企業和專業人士，以及外來投資者帶來新商機。

在深化與國際市場的聯繫方面，儘管海外市場經濟放緩、地緣政治帶來衝擊、美國的不合理關稅措施等帶來不少挑戰和不明朗因素，政府正積極透過多元化措施開拓新興市場，鞏固香港作為國際貿易中心的地位。自二○二二年上任後，行政長官先後五次率領高級別商貿代表團兩度出訪中東和三度出訪東南亞國家聯盟（東盟），為香港開拓商機及加強與這些經濟體的關係。這些訪問成果非常理想，與東盟各國不同單位簽署接近90份合作備忘錄和協議，涉及範疇廣泛。政府會繼續加強相關工作，積極開拓新經濟增長點。另外，香港會繼續擔當好作為「一帶一路」功能平台的角色，為國家推動共建「一帶一路」作出貢獻。香港將於今年迎來「一帶一路高峰論壇」十周年，論壇訂於今年九月十日至十一日舉行。我們已主動聯繫相關機構和組織，鼓勵它們於論壇前後舉辦與「一帶一路」相關活動以加強協同效應，說好國家及香港故事。

升級轉型、推動創新

剛才，很多議員都提到政府要加大力度幫助業界升級轉型、推動創新。就這一方面，政府正推出多項措施推動高增值產業發展。為進一步推進新型工業化發展，政府已推出一系列支援計劃，包括「新型工業加速計劃」、「新型工業化資助計劃」，支持策略性產業的企業在香港設立新智能生產設施，利用創科升級轉型，轉向智能製造。政府除了將於今年內推出先導計劃為本地製造業提供配對資助，鼓勵業界引入智能生產升級轉型生產線外，亦將設立「創科產業引導基金」，加強引導市場資金投資指定策略性新興及未來產業，系統性建設創科產業生態圈。我們期望透過以上措施促進科技創新與產業創新融合發展，引領香港更好地融入國家產業創新體系。

我亦聽到議員在太空經濟方面的意見和建議，除了在開場發言所提及的措施外，政府亦希望將科研投入成果化，其中InnoHK旗下香港太空機械人與能源中心的研究成果將直接應用於嫦娥八號探月任務，成為中國牽頭建立國際月球科研站先行計劃的重要組成部分，為國家的航天發展作出貢獻。就低軌衞星的工作方面，政府希望經簡化的申請制度能吸引投資、人才和企業以香港作為發展低軌衞星業務的基地。

促進金融創新、締造領先地位

剛才亦有好幾位議員提到促進金融創新。在這方面，政府正就數字資產交易服務提供者和數字資產託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議諮詢公眾，諮詢期至八月底。參考公眾意見及市場發展，政府會訂定相關發牌制度的細節，秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則，促進香港數字資產市場健康、負責任和可持續發展。

利用自身優勢、打造產業多元化

另外，多位議員都提及香港要利用自身優勢、打造產業多元化。事實上，香港絕對有條件利用自身在金融、貿易、專業服務、文化、旅遊、體育、教育等的優勢，配合外來機遇，專門發展有長遠潛力的範疇。

就發展伊斯蘭市場方面，現時本港的金融市場有各種伊斯蘭金融產品及服務，香港金融管理局與沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金簽署諒解備忘錄，共同出資支持創設一項目標規模達10億美元的新投資基金，促進與香港和大灣區有聯繫的企業在沙特當地發展。政府將繼續推展伊斯蘭市場有關金融、經貿及旅遊發展的工作，全方位把握伊斯蘭市場的各種機遇。

在專業認證服務方面，政府會持續提升相關部門的能力，並向業界提供優質的認可服務及推出新認可服務。政府部門亦會善用本港檢測認證業界的專業服務，從而確認市面上的產品及服務符合相關標準，例如議員提及的中藥或白酒等，以保障消費者的利益和安全。

在綠色產業方面，為達致經濟及環境雙贏發展，我們會透過善用已修復堆填區，以及相關科研及技術示範基金等，協助企業在香港推展綠色科技項目。政府正協助兩間本地綠色創科公司設立生產線，利用本地回收廢料，分別升級再造高價值的無電製冷及創冷產品的核心原料，以及高增值的聲學超材料產品。我們會繼續吸引和協助企業在香港發展綠色科技項目，打造香港成為綠色科技示範基地，助力國家輸出綠色科技及產品，爭取國際市場認可及強化競爭優勢。另一方面，政府亦會積極拓寬綠色金融科技生態圈，包括透過資助計劃推動有潛力的綠色金融科技方案於香港的商業環境中更廣泛應用。

在文化創意產業方面，政府會繼續積極落實《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，完善文藝創意產業生態圈。政府已公布改革表演場地的預訂政策，當中包括香港體育館定位由體育優先改為演唱會優先，助力發展演唱會經濟。政府亦會繼續策略性地發掘和支持具產業化潛力的香港文創項目，讓香港的創作「走出去」，同時推進與內地文創品牌的合作，善用內地機遇。

在體育產業方面，政府會把握好啟德體育園的機遇。這兩個星期舉行的「香港足球盛會2025」正好見證世界級足球隊在啟德主場館作賽，不但在社會營造熾熱的體育氛圍，更吸引內地與世界各地遊客訪港觀賽，帶動消費。今年十一月至十二月，香港將與廣東和澳門首次共同承辦第十五屆全國運動會及全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，預計將吸引超過10萬人次旅客來港觀賽，直接帶動旅遊、餐飲住宿和零售等消費。我們將充分善用這項國家盛事，配合不同的旅遊產品，吸引更多內地和海外遊客來港，進一步提升體育及旅遊的協同效應和相關經濟效益。

在教育產業方面，政府會繼續舉辦國際教育會議及展覽，突顯香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位。我們會加強在全球推廣「留學香港」品牌，吸引更多優秀境外學生。政府亦已推出新一輪批地計劃及開辦課程貸款計劃，以象徵式地價批出土地及提供免息貸款，支持自資院校擴容提質。

至於就寵物經濟的建議，相關部門會在今年下旬進行住戶飼養寵物主題性統計調查，從而收集香港家庭飼養寵物的相關數據。調查結果將有助業界了解飼養寵物的最新趨勢，讓商界朋友按市場需求提供產品和服務。

結語

主席，推動經濟發展有賴官、商、民通力合作。今日我很感謝各位議員提出非常有建設性的建議，商經局和其他政策局定必仔細考慮。政府會繼續為香港企業創造有利條件，把握發展機遇，提升香港的競爭力及國際影響力，配合國家戰略發展方向。主席，我謹此陳辭。"

HKTE revamps website to enable talent's convenient search for information (with photo),2025-07-31 13:00,2025-07-31 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100234.htm,"  Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) revamped its website (www.hkengage.gov.hk) today (July 31), enabling outside talent to efficiently and precisely search for practical information on talent admission schemes, settling in Hong Kong and career development, and promoting Hong Kong's unique advantages and opportunities to attract more international talent to pursue development in the city.

  The revamped website features a new interface with core themes of ""Work"", ""Live"" and ""Thrive"". Key enhanced features include:

(1) an expanded guide to living in Hong Kong to cover 18 categories, including education, healthcare, taxation, etc;

(2) a new dedicated page for HKTE activities, providing one-stop registration services;

(3) an enhanced recruitment platform network; and

(4) the introduction of a chatbot function, providing instant feedback to enquiries from talent.

  The revamped website also provides detailed information about Hong Kong's unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle of having the strong support of the country while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world, as well as positioning for the development of the ""eight centres"", to attract international high-calibre talent to Hong Kong to seize development opportunities.

  A spokesman for HKTE stated that the revamped website has optimised the user's experience, with clearer categorisation and key information at a glance under a new interface to create a more user-friendly platform for outside talent to obtain information, providing them with the strongest support in pursuing their development in Hong Kong.

  In addition, HKTE has revamped its logo to align with the three core themes of the revamped website. The new logo incorporates the colours of the themes to highlight vibrancy and creativity, symbolising talent settling and thriving in Hong Kong while embracing opportunities."
金管局回應美聯儲議息決定,2025-07-31 12:32,2025-07-31 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100394.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）聯邦公開市場委員會經過一連兩天的會議後，在香港時間今日（七月三十一日）清晨公布維持聯邦基金利率目標區間於4.25-4.5厘。

美聯儲維持息率不變的決定符合市場預期。然而，市場普遍認為美聯儲未來的減息步伐仍然存在較大的不確定性，視乎美國通脹和就業數據的走勢，其中關稅措施以及財政政策等對經濟活動的影響尚有待觀察。

香港方面，貨幣及金融市場保持有序運作。港元供應在五月初強勁資金流入後保持充裕，其後市場對港元需求有所減少，套息交易令港匯走弱。六月底以來，港匯數度觸發「弱方兌換保證」，而最近一次是在今晨紐約交易時段觸發。港元流動性逐漸縮減，港元拆息從低位溫和上升，但仍顯著低於美息。目前港美息差對套息交易仍具吸引力，因此令港匯繼續貼近7.85水平，但與此同時，近日股票相關的港元資金需求甚殷，為港匯提供一定支持。往後視乎港元資金供求變化，以及其他不確定因素包括美聯儲貨幣政策和美息走向、股票投資市場氣氛、外圍金融市場及環球資金流向等，「弱方兌換保證」可能會再度被觸發。屆時金管局將按照聯匯制度買入港元沽出美元，銀行體系總結餘將相應下降，而港元拆息將會逐步上升。

美國未來減息的幅度和步伐存在頗大的不確定性，而香港目前的利率環境因為上述各種變數亦可能出現變化，市民在作出置業、投資或借貸決定時，需充分考慮港元息率上升的可能性，並管理相關風險。金管局會繼續密切監察市場變化，維持貨幣及金融穩定。"

The case involved unauthorised building works (UBWs) in a unit of a residential building at Tai Kok Tsui Road, including the erection of a structure of about 90 square metres on the flat roof, and the installation of three metal gates obstructing the means of escape. As the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (July 31), ""Unauthorised building works may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-31 11:20,2025-07-31 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/31/P2025073100330.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

Director of Health meets Director General of Guangzhou Municipal Health Commission to deepen collaboration between Guangzhou and Hong Kong on communicable disease prevention and control (with photo),2025-07-30 21:52,2025-07-30 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000840.htm,"The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, today (July 30) led representatives of the department to meet with Director General of the Guangzhou Municipal Health Commission, Ms Chen Bin, in Guangzhou to learn about the latest situation of Chikungunya fever (CF) in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou and the disease prevention measures, as well as share the emergency preparedness adopted in Hong Kong, to deepen thecollaboration between Guangzhou and Hong Kong on disease prevention and control.

""Thanks to the support of the National Health Commission and the Health Commission of Guangdong Province, the joint prevention and control measures of CF fully demonstrates the continuous and deepening co-operation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao on prevention and control, and emergency response for communicable diseases. Owing to the communicable disease notification mechanism established by the three places, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) has kept abreast of the latest situation of CF in Guangdong Province. To enhance co-operation among professional staff and strengthen experience sharing in epidemic prevention and control, the DH has sent two field epidemiology doctors to join the Foshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention to conduct local epidemiological investigation and epidemic control, including mosquito surveillance, anti-mosquito operations in the community and management of patients, to gain invaluable experience on prevention and control of CF,"" said Dr Lam.

To further understand the latest epidemic prevention and control situation and measures, the DH has also sent a Principal Medical and Health Officer in the field of epidemiology from the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP to visit Foshan this afternoon to exchange views on prevention measures on CF with the staff members of the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration and Foshan Center of Disease Control and Prevention.

The recent spike in CF cases in multiple regions worldwide (including neighbouring areas), and more frequently travelling among members of the public during summer holidays, pose an extremely high risk of imported cases in Hong Kong. The Government has been gearing up for emergency preparedness in response to the possible imported cases of CF, and intensifying publicity and health education across all fronts.

Public Education

The CHP will hold an online live seminar on its Facebook page from 8.30pm to 9pm tomorrow (July 31), to provide the latest information and health advices on CF, and respond to related enquiries from the public. Members of public are welcome to attend.

The CHP has set up mobile promotional booths at multiple locations across Hong Kong (including public markets, community health centres, and shopping malls) to educate the public on how to prevent mosquito-borne diseases. Details can be viewed atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html.

Members of the public may visit the CF webpage of the CHP and Travel Health Service for the latest information and health advice.

Forum for the industry

The Infection Control Branch of the CHP and the Infectious Disease Control Training Centre of the Hospital Authority jointly organised the first online forum on July 28 for healthcare professionals from the public and private medical institutions. The forum covered topics on epidemiology and latest epidemic situation in Foshan, diagnosis and clinical management of CF, as well as anti-mosquito measures. The forum enhanced healthcare professionals' knowledge on the disease and its responsive measures through sharing and explanation by experts. The CHP will organise a second forum for healthcare professionals tomorrow.

The CHP also issued letters to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel. If CF cases are detected, they should be immediately referred to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures.

Latest situation regarding CF

According to the information from the Foshan health authority, as of July 28, there were over 5 600 cases in Foshan. The majority of cases (4 890 cases) were in Shunde District. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases so far. Moreover, confirmed cases were also recorded in other cities in Guangdong Province recently. Regarding Macao, as of July 29, there were six imported cases of CF, four of them travelled toFoshan during the incubation period.

In 2019, Hong Kong recorded 11 imported cases of CF. There have been no CF cases since 2020."

四川近年在科技創新、綠色發展等領域都有長足發展，經濟活力持續提升，是國家西部地區經濟的重要引擎，也是西部大開發戰略中的核心省份。二○一八年，香港特區政府與四川省政府建立了川港合作會議機制，為兩地提供了重要的協作平台，有效深化川港合作。香港作為國際金融、貿易和航運中心，擁有強大的經貿網絡和專業的金融服務能力，能夠協助四川招商引資，並支持當地企業開拓海外市場，實現優勢互補，共同推進國家的高質量發展。

初唐文學天才王勃在送友人赴四川上任的名詩句說：「海內存知己，天涯若比鄰。」雖然四川跟香港相隔千里，但兩地人民緊密相連。為了深化川港兩地的連繫，香港四川社團總會自二○一九年成立以來，一直扮演着川港交流與合作的重要橋樑角色。總會不但致力團結在港川籍鄉賢的力量，推動川港兩地互利共贏，更積極加強兩地在經貿、文化、教育等領域的務實合作，促進民心相通。去年，總會聯同特區政府和多個地區團體，舉辦了「喜迎熊貓系列活動」，與香港市民共同慶祝香港大熊貓家庭喜添四位新成員，並藉此掀起「熊貓熱潮」，為香港旅遊發展注入新活力。對於總會的孜孜付出和卓越貢獻，我表示感謝和敬佩。

習近平主席強調，建設文化強國對中國式現代化建設和中華民族復興大業十分重要，並指出我們必須更加主動地傳播中華文化，展示中國形象，提升國家文化的軟實力。今年，總會在四川省政府的大力支持下，開展「錦繡天府安逸四川」四川非遺文化到香港展現。活動邀請多位優秀的四川藝術家來港，為我們帶來變臉、清音等極具傳統特色的表演，同時也把蜀錦、銀花絲、糖畫等非遺工藝帶到香港展出。除了今晚的演出外，總會還會於未來兩天在深水埗和啟德舉行四川非遺文化活動，讓市民近距離感受四川的文化魅力，進一步鞏固兩地人民的情誼。展望未來，我相信總會將繼續發揮同鄉社團的橋樑作用，向海外僑胞和外國友人展現川港兩地的優秀文化藝術創作，說好川港故事、說好中國故事。

最後，我祝願國家繁榮昌盛，川港兩地人和業茂，香港四川社團總會新一屆理事會執委會工作順利，「錦繡天府安逸四川」四川非遺文化走進香港演出圓滿成功！謝謝大家。"

​財政司司長發布《香港營商環境報告：一國兩制 獨特優勢》記者會開場發言及答問內容（附圖／短片）,2025-07-30 20:40,2025-07-30 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000765.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（七月三十日）下午聯同商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺和署理政府經濟顧問林幗瑛博士舉行記者會，發布《香港營商環境報告：一國兩制 獨特優勢》的開場發言及答問內容：

財政司司長：各位傳媒朋友、各位市民，大家好。

政府今日發表新一份《香港營商環境報告》，向社會各界和海內外人士、投資者介紹香港最新的營商環境和各方面優勢。這是特區政府繼二○二一年後再度發表這份報告，目的是系統地向外界清晰說明香港在社會穩定下來、走出疫情之後，這幾年持續向好的發展。這信息在當前複雜多變的地緣政治環境是重要的，讓世界各地的商界朋友及投資者，更深入了解香港不同領域的實況及機遇，充分利用香港在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的獨特優勢，以及作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的功能，為他們所帶來的龐大機遇。

報告詳列了不同的數據，闡述香港因着制度優勢與不斷提升的競爭力，進一步吸引了資金流入、企業和人才匯聚，成果顯著；在多項外商調查以至多項國際排名方面均廣受認同。這些事實全方位說明了香港開放、安全、穩定、可靠、高效和國際化的營商環境。

事實上，多組數字都反映了國際投資者對香港的信心正進一步提升，例如：

股市表現穩步向上：恒生指數繼去年上升18%後，今年以來再上升了27%，上半年每日成交額上升120%至2,400億元。今年截至七月中，港股有52隻IPO，即新股集資，集資額接近1,300億元，按年上升約6倍。
吸引海內外企業：去年，母公司在境外的香港公司接近10 000家，按年上升10%。引進重點企業辦公室自二○二二年年底以來，引進了84家重點企業，它們合共會投資約500億元，創造20 000個職位，而它們所使用的樓面面積都達到168萬平方呎；此外，在二○二三年一月至二○二五年上半年，投資推廣署亦協助了超過1 300家海內外企業在港開設或拓展業務，帶來約1,600億元投資。
吸引人才：各項引進人才計劃共收到約50萬份申請，已批出33萬個申請，約22萬人已經抵達香港。
國際排名：在瑞士洛桑國際管理發展學院的《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港連續兩年上升合共四位，登上全球第三；另外，今年初的國際金融中心排名，香港繼續位列三甲；而去年十月，加拿大菲沙研究所《世界經濟自由度2024年度報告》，香港亦都再次名列第一。而三大評級機構，最近均一致給予香港良好的信用評級和「穩定」的評級展望等。


在這幾年，國安法的實施讓香港重建安全穩定的環境，不僅保障了市民大眾的權利和自由，同時也讓香港成為更吸引國際資金和投資的安全港。

短期而言，香港的經濟在去年增長2.5%，今年首季增長3.1%。明日我們會公布第二季的本地生產總值預估數字，估計增長勢頭保持，這將是連續第十個季度增長。出口、整體投資、私人消費預計均會錄得正增長。政府通過積極推動旅遊業及盛事項目帶動消費氣氛，消費市道呈初步回穩的跡象；住宅物業市場亦趨向穩定。政府會繼續透過多項措施支援面對挑戰的行業，例如資金周轉、市場開拓、數字化轉型等，以提升其競爭力和生產力等。

總的而言，面對複雜多變的外圍環境，香港經濟結構正在升級轉型，我們看到的機遇大於挑戰。金融市場表現亮麗、創科產業快速發展，傳統行業也積極轉型升級，一些面對挑戰的行業，例如零售、餐飲等，也有穩住的勢頭。宏觀而言，有國家的支持，政府、各界和市民的共同努力，只要我們準確識變、科學應變、主動求變，必定可以取得新的突破，發展新的增長點，為香港開創新局面。

我的開場發言到此，看看大家有沒有甚麽提問。

記者：三位你們好。想先問你們三位如何評估香港下半年，甚至全年的經濟增長的前景？接下來有一些譬如是關稅措施，對於香港的營商環境會否帶來一些變數？第二，見到有不少外資來到，國際排名都有些上升，但直接貼近民生的，例如餐飲、零售，以至戲院行業，又如何受惠？謝謝。

財政司司長：多謝你。我們估計香港下半年會維持經濟增長。今年第一季本地生產總值增長3.1%，第二季的數字明天公布，大致上會維持這個勢頭。現時在地緣政治和關稅戰下，外圍環境是複雜多變，亦有很多不確定性，具體增長要同時看推動增長的「三頭馬車」：出口、消費和投資。關稅戰對出口的影響還要視乎具體措施如何。過去這段時間，內地從事出口的企業其實已經在海外，尤其是東南亞，重新布局其產業鏈和供應鏈，以緩減關稅對它們的影響。至於消費方面，我們看到的數字顯示消費是穩定下來，待會我請政府經濟顧問仔細跟大家說明。在旅客訪港方面，增長勢頭是非常好，加上特區政府一直舉辦不同盛事活動吸引旅客，我們見到上半年旅客增長數字是雙位數，尤其是國際旅客的增長更為顯著，這對於我們的市道都會有一定幫助。

目前來說，香港經濟正經歷轉型階段，在轉型階段裏，不同行業以至企業，其反應和調整進程都未必完全一樣，步伐亦未必一致。我們見到一些行業是比較好，譬如一些新興行業如創科和Web 3.0，即金融科技、數字資產這一塊；但同時亦有一些行業，尤其是傳統行業，在轉型過程中遇到一些挑戰和壓力。我們會盡力支持他們轉型：資金方面有不同的貸款擔保計劃；如果他們是出口企業則在市場推廣方面，至於本地零售和餐飲企業，我們通過不同的計劃助力它們的數碼轉型和升級，這都是希望幫助它們更快更好地適應這個轉變中的環境。

署理政府經濟顧問：我或許補充一些數據給大家。其實早前已經公布的零售業總銷貨價值（二○二五年五月份零售業銷貨額臨時統計數字）在連續下跌14個月後，今年五月已經轉跌為升，（數字）為2.4%。相關六月的數字（二○二五年六月零售業銷貨額統計）很快會作出公布，相信也會穩住勢頭。

至於食肆方面，第一季（二零二五年第一季食肆收益及購貨額臨時統計數字）的情況輕微下跌0.6%，但是初步數字顯示第二季也見到回穩，這是零售和餐飲的情況。

剛才司長也提到訪港旅客的數目，上半年錄得雙位數增長，直至七月，我們留意到首28日的數字按年上升12%，所以相關勢頭仍然維持。在這個背景下，明日會公布GDP（本地生產總值）數字（二○二五年第二季本地生產總值預先估計數字），所以在這些穩定的情況之下，以及看到現在的消費氣氛有些回穩，私人消費開支在第二季有望止跌回升。以上是我的補充，謝謝。

記者：都想延續講講零售業的話題，因為看到近年有些零售或者食肆都說他們受「內捲」這個問題所影響。其實你們在這方面怎樣可以幫助到他們零售業在現時這個經營狀況比較困難的情況之下，幫他們成功轉型？另一方面，就是講到政府很大力地推進盛事經濟，今年都見到早前的足球賽事的反應都非常好，其實你們未來明年在盛事經濟方面的計劃會是怎樣？會聚焦哪一個方面去做？以及有些坊間的意見建議你們向中央爭取明年APEC財長會議在香港舉行，政府的態度是如何？另一方面，談到剛剛銀行公布的業績都說到房地產對他們的壞帳影響其實都開始浮現出來。政府現時如何看房地產市道，除了房地產市道的走勢和對其他各個香港經濟不同環節，例如是銀行業的穩定方面，其實你們的看法是如何？多謝。

財政司司長：多謝你。零售和餐飲方面在這段時間事實上遇到壓力。在經濟轉型過程中，商戶要不斷就着市場變化、客戶喜好、對購物、餐飲等消費體驗和需求的轉變，要想不同辦法推陳出新。

我們見到市面上有個別商戶在轉型過程中做得不錯，當然，亦有一些面臨的壓力比較大。我們希望繼續多方面支持努力打拼的企業，尤其不少是中小型企業，包括剛才所說在資金周轉、以資訊科技提升其競爭力、提升效率等，以至搞旺市面的氣氛，最重要是人丁旺，氣氛好，大家就會有興趣出來消費。

這就帶到你剛才提到的盛事。今年我們安排了不少盛事活動。早前大家在啟德體育園都看過不同比賽，亦有演唱會和其他活動。未來，我們會用好這個重要的基建設施，主辦更多活動。

明年的盛事，稍後會再作公布。盛事並不單是旅遊，亦包括體育，以至其他活動。而就旅遊而言，旅客除了來購物以外，也可在港深度遊，以至主題旅遊，這些都是我們正在全力開拓的方向。

同時，我們亦鼓勵跨界別的合作，例如最近在啟德體育園的比賽，附近的酒店和食肆會合作推出項目。這類跨界別合作，令旅客有更好的體驗，覺得更物有所值。

剛才你提到一些活動的主辦，請恕我在此不就個別項目回應。總的來說，在特區政府來說，未來不同類型的盛事，不管是金融、體育、文化等，我們都會繼續大力去推動。同時，我們亦鼓勵私人機構舉辦盛事，例如旅遊事務署和旅遊發展局很樂意幫助他們舉辦不同項目，讓在活動舉辦期間來到的客人覺得更好玩、更開心，可以在香港逗留得更久，多住一兩晚。

我們鼓勵在香港的私人機構，例如金融機構以至其他機構舉辦活動。最近的動漫節，參與程度相當踴躍，參加的人士除了來自內地之外，也有不少來自東南亞，甚至遠道從歐美而來。我們希望通過不同類型的活動，「百貨應百客」，能夠多方面吸引不同人士來到香港。

我們曾與主辦單位和來到香港參加活動的朋友談起，很多人都很享受在香港的旅程，覺得這個城市除了很安全、出入很方便以外，亦是多姿多彩。

你最後關於銀行業績的問題。就本港的房地產市道而言，住宅樓宇的樓價是趨向平穩的，特別是看看最近這三個月，可以說是有輕微、約百分之零點幾的上升，總的來說平穩。

商業和辦公樓方面，可能還需要一些時間去恢復。畢竟過去一段時間，有一定的供應；另一方面，疫情之後的辦公方式，亦轉變了很多。而營商方式方面，例如銷售途徑等亦起了不少變化，例如電商的流行。

在政府而言，我們正處理這個問題，例如我們已經沒有賣商業用地，不在這個時間增加供應，給時間市場消化目前市面上的樓面面積。同時間，亦由需求方面着手。這有幾方面，一是鼓勵非政府機構，如果要用地方，同時有財力的話，可以購置辦公地方，港交所便是其中一個例子。

除此之外，在現時經濟轉型中，個別有些行業的景況不錯，大家可以見到在中環有一些大型跨國金融機構一下子便租很多層的樓面面積，尤其做財富和資產管理的金融機構。我們亦見到一些對沖基金大規模擴充辦公的地方。

此外，我們也見到有一間從事第三代互聯網的企業整幢購入兩幢大廈，一幢在銅鑼灣，另一幢在灣仔，來做第三代互聯網、金融科技方面的業務。所以，當我們努力發展經濟、招商引資，越來越多企業進駐香港的話，他們就需要用地方，這樣就可消化辦公樓面。

我剛才說，引進重點企業辦公室引進了大概80多間重點企業，總投資約500億元。我們統計過，這些企業用到約168萬平方呎的樓面；投資推廣署方面，引進公司的數量就更大。

另一方面，我們亦盡量配合市場上把寫字樓、按它們的位置和市場需要轉型做其他用途，例如一間大學在紅磡購買了整座樓來做學生宿舍等。這即是說，靈活一點以不同用途來把存貨盤活。

總括而言，我們是從供應到需求雙管齊下，處理目前的辦公樓存貨。

至於銀行業績方面，整體而言本港銀行在這兩年其實利潤相當不錯。當然，每間銀行的個別情況有點不相同，我亦不會評論個別銀行，因為不同銀行發展業務時有不同重點。但有一點都可以說的，就是整體我們銀行的壞帳撥備，其實在全球的標準來說，都是處於一個非常穩健的水平。個別有些銀行的經營利潤比較好，尤其在過往一段時間，有些銀行做資產管理、財富管理，以至因應資本市場好、股票市場暢旺，從資本市場方面賺得豐厚利潤，這樣的話就讓他們有更好的條件就着一些呆壞帳--有時也未必實際是壞帳，而是銀行想審慎一點，加大撥備，這方面也不出奇。

總的來說，即使是作出撥備之後，整體來說，銀行的資本充足率達到約21%，其實環球的標準要求都只是8%，而且它們的流動性很充裕。

從這個角度來看，我們認為金融體系、銀行體系仍然是非常穩健。我們在多年前，在二○二／二一年，差不多是COVID前，已經就商業銀行信貸在宏觀審慎方面下工夫。

記者：你好，想問對上一次是二○二一年發布這份報告，有否說為甚麼今次會選擇這個時間推出？數字說得那麼好，但其實市民好像看不到。今次發布這份報告是否想穩定民心？另外之前網誌說過現時香港在經濟轉型的階段，會幫忙轉型，有沒有一些具體措施？謝謝。

財政司司長：經濟方面，如果我們看數字，正如剛才政府經濟顧問所說，我們去年錄得經濟增長，今年第一季亦繼續增長，第二季亦會維持增長幅度，整年來說，二○二五年都維持經濟增長。但經濟正在轉型中，一是因應地緣政治，二是面對科技變革，三是數字化轉型加快，這些都使得競爭十分激烈。所以香港經濟正轉型，這是結構性轉型──包括產業結構的改變。除了國際金融中心、貿易中心外，推動我們下一步經濟增長的重要動力是創新科技，但創新科技不只是香港獨有。環顧全球，國家之間、經濟體之間的競爭，都圍繞創科的發展和應用，而這方面是需要時間來培育的。過去這段時間，我們積極培育創科產業，無論在投資和就業方面，相關增長都相當快，剛才我已用引進重點企業辦公室的數字向大家說明。但同時，一些傳統行業，譬如大家剛才所說的零售和餐飲業，事實上是有壓力的，這個我們很理解。在政府來說，我們也想方設法提供一些支援。當然最大的幫助是人流更旺、生意更好，所以我們很努力舉辦更多盛事，又爭取內地來港旅客的購物免稅額度增加，這方面我們會繼續努力看看是否可以有進一步增加的可能。而旅客來到，我們的旅遊體育文化設施等各方面是否可以更加吸引？是否可有更多不同活動，讓旅客留更長時間？有更多人逗留，在這裏的消費便更多。這是大家正在努力的方向。

至於一些受壓比較大的行業，除了剛才說的餐飲和零售，還有建造業。就建造業而言，我們認為會趨向穩定。為何這樣說？住宅物業市場現時已穩定下來，當住宅物業市場穩定下來，當目前的一些樓盤──譬如最近期一些一手樓盤，開售的市價相當「貼市」且賣得不錯──當這些動起來時，接下來二手樓樓市便會動起來。目前息口減下來的速度和幅度比大家原本想像來得慢，因為美國面對通脹等問題。但最近兩、三個月，因為外來的資金很多，使香港的資金更充裕，所以銀行同業拆息低了很多，這除了減輕了企業經營的壓力，也對住宅市場提供了一定支持。

隨着我們的經濟持續發展，市場對住宅物業自然有更大需求。企業來到這裏擴充業務，亦會衍生更大的需求。至於我剛才提到吸引人才，通過不同的輸入人才計劃，我們批了近33萬宗申請，來了約22萬人，其他人會陸續來。陸續來的也不會是自己一個人來，很多是帶同家庭來的，這些人才相對來說比較年輕，收入亦相對較高。這些都是消費力，也是我們物業市場下一階段的購買力。去年樓價下跌，但租金上升，即樓價和租金背馳，這個現象説明甚麼呢？可以這樣看，一方面，當樓價下跌，大家想買樓時會怕它未止跌，暫時不入市，所以會暫時租住。從外面移居來港的人初到來，大多是先租住，先看一下自己是否適應，另一方面是看看孩子在哪裏讀書，才決定住在哪裏。我們估計這些都會是日後的購買力。此外，一些內地來的朋友如果要買樓，會需要資金，內地的資金是否能夠調動出來，目前來說可調出來的資金相對還有一些限制，我們正努力跟相關的中央部委研究是否可以在一個合適的範圍內，就這方面有所放寬，讓內地朋友更便利地將資金調過來，又不會因此造成資本外流。如果可以這樣做的話，他們也會成為購買力的一部分。

對各位市民來說，在現時的轉型過程中，事實上有不少人的壓力很大、這點我們明白。我們都很努力，希望通過一步步的工作，當成果顯現出來的時候，大家都會受惠。現時整體失業率大約是3.5%，但收入中位數持續上升。換句話說，現時最大的挑戰就是在轉型過程裏，個別行業和部分市民未能完全受惠，因此我們會提供更多支援。這包括職業再培訓計劃，而就青年人而言，我們也有不同計劃，包括幫助他們創業、提供實習機會，希望從多方面協助大家更容易適應這個過程，也提升自己。謝謝。

"Remarks at press conference on ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"" (with photos/video)",2025-07-30 20:40,2025-07-30 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000768.htm,"  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan; the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau; and the Acting Government Economist, Dr Cecilia Lam, held a press conference on the ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"" this afternoon (July 30). Following are their remarks:

Reporter: I have some questions. First of all, this report seems that it is a wrapping up of all the measures over the past few years. So, what is the significance of this report to Hong Kong's future development? Also, amid the rising challenges such as the tariff increases, how are you going to convince foreign chambers or investors to invest in Hong Kong? The last question is about the reports of the developer of 11 Skies of the Airport City project, with some reports saying that the developer has intended to sell this mega project, because of lack of tenants and also lacklustre prospects. So what is your take on the proposal of selling 11 Skies to other parties? Thank you.

Financial Secretary: Thank you. First, the significance of this report. Over the past few years, because of COVID, a lot of overseas visitors didn't have the opportunity to visit Hong Kong. Given the geopolitical landscape, there has been some misperception about the situation of Hong Kong in the western world. . We are trying very hard to reach out to the international community, to explain to them what is really happening here in Hong Kong by sharing facts and data. The purpose of this report is to recap our developments in a concise report for distribution to them, and this report will be made available online, accessible to anyone who is interested.

 On the question of tariffs, on the question of the China-US geopolitical tension, of course, there are challenges, for example, in terms of exports, but there are also opportunities in respect of the international financial centre status of Hong Kong. For challenges on export, the direct impact is minimal because Hong Kong is basically a service economy; we don't have much manufacturing. On the other hand, the indirect impact could be significant, because we re-export for the Mainland. But over the years, we have seen a number of trends. One of them is Mainland companies realigning their industry bases and supply chains across Southeast Asia. For exports to certain markets, such as the US, a lot of the exports come from those regions. When you look at the figures - the export figures from the Mainland to the US, or from the Mainland via Hong Kong to the US - the share of US in Mainland's total export has been declining.

 From our standpoint, we are adjusting our position. In addition to doing re-export, we have shifted to provide high-value supply chain management and the related trade finance and professional services. That is our response. For opportunities, I think we should not underestimate them. Given the geopolitical landscape, it is increasingly difficult for Mainland companies to go to the US for listing. These companies, would naturally want to come to Hong Kong for listing, because by coming to Hong Kong, they can access both international and Mainland capital. This is a very interesting value proposition to them, and has been demonstrated by the figures so far this year. In fact, we have over 200 companies in the pipeline waiting for listing. But the opportunities are more than the IPO market. Say in asset and wealth management, residents in the GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) are interested in having certain assets allocated offshore. Naturally, Hong Kong is the destination. The recent improvement in February last year to the GBA Wealth Management Connect - with the implementation of those measures, we have seen significant inflow of capital from the GBA into Hong Kong. In addition, we also have observed capital flow from the Middle East and ASEAN in the asset and wealth management sector. We are quite confident that, by the year 2027 and 2028 the latest - we will overtake Switzerland in cross-border wealth management.

 Another dimension is Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" under the current geopolitical situation. We have observed Mainland companies' keen interest to go global. First, this is national policy, i.e. high-level two-way opening up. Second, there is also a need, because these companies want to utilise the production capacity they have and do more exports. What we have been pitching to them is that the best way to do it is to come to Hong Kong, set up a company, use Hong Kong as a platform as well as a brand to go overseas. In our experience in engaging the Middle East and ASEAN, the value of the ""Hong Kong brand"" is very much respected. This is one way in which we can help them. In the process, Our professional services and other service providers will benefit.

 Finally, on 11 Skies, I won't comment on individual projects. But overall, the attitude of the Government is that, given the economic transition, and given the challenges currently in the non-domestic property market, banks should be supportive to their clients and help them ride through challenges. In the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, HKMA, a working group has been set up between the Hong Kong Association of Banks and the HKMA. This working group deals with individual cases with a view to helping the communication between the banks and borrowers, so that the lenders can extend a more accommodative and facilitative approach to help borrowers who have a viable business model and have a genuine interest in carrying on their business, but are just facing a liquidity crunch. That is the overall attitude of the Government. Thank you.

Reporter: Hi Mr Chan. So, I just want to follow up on the previous question first. So what's the significance of issuing the report now, like after the previous issuance of four years ago? Like, why does the Government choose to issue the new report at present? And also, you mentioned a lot of positive signs in the markets, like the stock markets booming, and Hong Kong also saw a record capital inflows in the first half of the year. So why does the Government still remain quite conservative over an uptick of the annual GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth target for the whole year? And also, how do you see the sustainability of such momentum moving forward? And second question I also want to ask about four sectors that are facing structural changes, like you mentioned, to the retail and catering. Do you see the need to further enhance the support measures besides helping them achieve digital transformation? And finally, about the tariff truce, so the Chinese and US (United States) officials just reached agreements to extend their tariff suspension. So how do you assess the impacts on local business, and would the Government take any steps to help, perhaps exports or local businesses to take this opportunity? Thank you.

Financial Secretary: Thank you. Well, the last report was published in 2021. Over the past few years, because of COVID, a lot of overseas travellers hadn't come to Hong Kong. Given the geopolitical landscape, the perception about Hong Kong in the Western world is not entirely factual and correct. There are some misconceptions. So the purpose of this report is to show to them the current situation in Hong Kong, so that they will be able to better understand what is happening in this city. If they are interested, they are welcome to visit us to see for themselves what it is really like here and the tremendous opportunities available.

 As regards the question about the GDP estimate for the whole year, the GDP growth for the first half of this year has been positive. For the first quarter, the growth was 3.1 per cent; for the second quarter, we have maintained the momentum. But given the geopolitical landscape, there are enormous uncertainty and volatility. At this stage, we think it would be prudent to keep the current GDP estimate. There is in fact a mechanism, a defined timetable for reviewing the GDP estimate regularly. On a published timeline, the Government Economist will share with the community the economic situation, and determine at that time whether to make any revision. It's better to follow that established practice as it provides certainty to the market.

 As to supporting the retail and catering sector, we will keep an open mind. I have elaborated on the situation and how we have been trying to help, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation and if necessary, roll out measures. At this stage, we think the current support measures should stay. Let us observe for a longer time. We have been providing various support measures such as the BUD Fund (Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales) for marketing development and e-commerce. Algernon would share more about that.

Before passing to Algernon, I would say the recent discussions leading to the temporary suspension of tariff rise is, of course, a positive sign. But on the other hand, we are conscious of the fact that things can change overnight. There is still tremendous uncertainty, and consequently, volatility. So for our work, first, we need to ensure financial stability and financial security. On the other hand, stay on course, focus on what we have set out to do, and be persistent with our efforts. That includes reinforcing our relationship with traditional markets like Europe and the US, and at the same time, opening up new markets and new capital sources from the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Thank you, Algernon please.

Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development: Regarding the challenges facing the retail and food and beverage sectors, we have different measures and funding helping the retail sector, such as the BUD Fund. We are also encouraging the sectors to look for changes and transformation, and e-commerce is one of the measures that we promote. Just today, we are going to launch the Hong Kong Shopping Festival for cross-border e-commerce to allow the retail sector to do more e-commerce business. For the maximum cumulative funding of $7 million per enterprise under the BUD Fund, they can apply for $1 million for e-commerce business to arrange for promotion and advertising for e-commerce business across the border.

There are also measures to encourage tourists to come to Hong Kong. Actually, the number of tourists coming to Hong Kong is increasing. It is a positive sign that would help the retail sector. But most importantly, as mentioned by the Financial Secretary, it is time for transformation. We have to look at customer behaviour and their needs, and how we can satisfy customer demand. It is one of the major issues that we have to jointly resolve with enterprises. I have met with different chambers and associations of the retail sector. We had very good discussions on helping them to tackle the challenging situation. As mentioned by the Financial Secretary, we will keep an open mind to look at the situation and to see whether there is a need to introduce further measures to help the retail and food and beverage sectors. Thank you.

Financial Secretary: We should be very confident in Hong Kong's attractiveness as a hub for foreign businesses and talent. Over the past few years, I've been travelling a lot and also heavily engaged with the foreign business community in Hong Kong. I can summarise three key reasons why people should choose Hong Kong. First is, of course, for business reasons. Hong Kong has the proximity and sometimes priority access to the Mainland market. Depending on which sector you are in – if you are in the tech sector, say in the biotech sector, Hong Kong has an additional advantage because of our proximity to Shenzhen, and we are part of the GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) which is a technology hub. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster is very competitive in innovation.

 Apart from that, it is the capital market and the full range of funding options available here. For companies at different development stages, whether they are start-ups or others, we welcome them. In Hong Kong, we have around 4,700 start-ups, and the number represents a significant increase compared to that a few years ago. About 20 per cent of their founders come from overseas, and they come here for funding, professional advice, mentoring, and opportunities. In my discussions with the start-ups in Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, they value these as well as the innovation ecosystem very much. For start-ups, what they need are application scenarios, professional advice and funding support, and they are all available here. In Hong Kong, we have set up the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, which provides patient capital. This means that if enterprises are engaged in cutting-edge technologies, we are willing to support them from small, and help them grow and connect them with fund managers to raise funds.

The second reason is for their families and children. It is well recognised Hong Kong's law and order is excellent. We are a very safe city. Education here is also outstanding. Moreover, this is an open and multicultural society, and it is very free. We have gathered a lot of overseas professionals and foreign businessmen here.

Finally, it is about our lifestyle. Whether it is city life, F&B (food and beverage) or our countryside. So with all these, I think if we play our cards right, Hong Kong's opportunities in the future are tremendous. Thank you for attending this conference. I appreciate your time. Thank you.

​立法會：運輸及物流局局長根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 19:15,2025-07-30 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000711.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案的總結發言：

主席：

感謝各位議員剛才表達的寶貴意見，我一一細心聆聽，現在此作一個綜合的回應。

首先，今日就這兩項動議，我們的目的很簡單、很直接，就是提升道路安全和維持路面的交通暢順。在香港，道路的空間實在是有限，有私家車亦有商用車，之後我會再談及商用車。剛才有多位議員都提到自己或其他從社會上聽到的意見，作為駕駛者，當去到某些地區想泊車然後消費、吃東西，或有一些夜間的經濟活動，正因為某些地區在某些時段會有特別多的私家車使用者到訪。即使那個區域有兩條或三條行車線，亦可能會因為車位有限，有私家車或會停泊而佔用了兩條行車線，導致只得一條行車線供其他人使用，造成交通擠塞，這些情況現時在社會不時出現。

今日我聽到多位議員都對特區政府提出這個就一些定額罰款作出水平調整的動議，大部分都表示認同和理解，尤其是對於調整19項有關道路安全和導致交通擠塞相關的一些罰款額，多位議員剛才的發言都表示認同，亦都認為有需要增加阻嚇力。其中有個別議員提及希望做到有效的交通管理，以及減少路面擠塞，提升行人的過路安全。局方和署方（運輸署）未來會大力積極推動利用科技在道路和行人路過路設施上，包括交通燈實時管控，亦會有一些比較創新的設計，這是我們未來的方向。

不少議員發言關注泊車位供應。正如我在開場發言提及，接下來我想聚焦講述未來的策略，以積極回應多位議員剛才提及包括商用車方面的關注。政府過去幾年積極推展一系列短期及中長期措施，採取多管齊下的策略，全方位、默默耕耘增加泊車位，當中包括政策創新、多利用科技、推動不同部門加強合作，努力盡快優先滿足商用車輛的泊車需求。跟大家分享一下整體的數字，透過不同措施提供的泊車位總數達30 000個，商用車位佔了三分之一，而過去三年新增的泊車位則超過15 000個。泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例，以私家車為例，由二○二一年的1.09逐漸回升至現時的1.14，增長達4.6%，可見增加泊車位措施已漸見成效。

展望未來，政府預計未來兩年內新增泊車位數量將超過12 000個，包括至少700個商用車泊位。另外我們會努力在新短期租約停車場及私人項目提供更多泊位，並聚焦於增加商用車泊位，特別是剛才盧偉國議員和陳紹雄議員均提到的分區情況──較為短缺及違例泊車比較常見的地區如觀塘、葵青、黃大仙、油尖旺及深水埗。就分區做一些指標未必切實可行，我們認為必須要由源頭做起，尤其是一些商用車泊位。很多司機在一日營運之後，可能會回到所居住的地方，譬如一些公共屋邨，所以我們的策略要更加聚焦他們的居住地或者在鄰近地方尋求一些泊車位。惟土地空間真的有限，我們希望盡量靈活使用一些土地。我今日向大家強調，具體和具針對性的措施總共有八項：（i）未來在規劃新發展區時，在道路設計上配置夜間路旁商用車泊車位，供商用車夜間停泊；（ii）積極安排於現有公營房屋開放更多上落客貨處，供商用車夜間停泊，以配合普遍居於公營房屋的商用車司機需要；（iii）安排非住宅用地的附屬泊車位和上落客貨處予商用車於夜間停泊；（iv）現時全港已設有約1 800個夜間路旁泊車位，未來運輸署會加大力度，搜尋更多合適的夜間路旁泊車位，尤其是公共屋邨鄰近位置；（v）鑑於過去幾年商用車位流失主因是許多短期租約停車場被收回，未來我們在決定這些土地的用途時，會加重照顧商用車泊位需求的考量，例如我們近期再與各政府部門加強商討，爭取短期內可在短期租約停車場再增加200個商用車車位，運輸署會繼續爭取設置更多的短期租約停車場；（vi）按二○二一年修訂的《香港規劃標準與準則》的首批資助房屋將於明年陸續落成，我們預計在按照此《準則》而落成及設計的資助房屋中，提供4 800個停車位，當中包括超過200個商用車位；（vii）進一步鼓勵私人停車場採用自動泊車系統。我們計劃在二○二六年或之前，提供不少於3 000個自動化泊車位，現時有五個自動化公眾停車場的工務工程項目正處於興建階段，包括位於將軍澳、新蒲崗及深水埗，而這些系統將會提供多種不同類型的自動泊車系統，包括拼圖型、立體型和圓筒型；再加上六個分布在荃灣、大埔、深水埗、馬鞍山、油麻地的短期租約停車場；我們會爭取在今年年底至二○二九年期間落成有關項目；（viii）正如剛才多位議員提到，除了硬件，在軟件方面，我們會透過加強應用科技和數據以增加泊車位的資訊發放，大幅利用科技提升駕駛者的泊車效率和體驗，引入自動泊車系統以善用空間增加車位密度，亦希望透過應用程式提供實時空置泊車位資訊，以便利駕駛者尋找泊車位，現時已覆蓋超過700個停車場的12萬個泊位和分布全港十八區的全部兩萬多個路旁咪錶位，並透過修例容許駕駛者使用遙控泊車功能，方便他們在狹窄車位泊車。透過上述的八項措施，我很有信心並承諾會令未來香港的泊車位供應持續大為改善，至於商用車位方面，我們定下一個務實目標──未來新增商用車泊位的速率會比過往更加快。

執法方面，警務處進行交通執法時，主要考慮是確保道路安全，減少意外及傷亡，以及維持道路暢通。警務處早前已向立法會交通事務委員會報告前線人員會在不影響道路安全的前提下，視乎現場實際環境靈活判斷，或會就個別情況作酌情處理。根據警方提供的資料，警務人員除了會按照既定的執法指引，亦會視乎每宗個案的相關情況作出考慮，包括評估涉事的車輛是否會造成交通阻塞或構成危險；違例的情況會否屬於一些重點交通執法項目之中，特別是和交通擠塞相關的情況；駕駛者有沒有具備一個合理的原因，以及他們會在合乎指引的情況下適當行使酌情權，例如發出警告以代替用檢控方式處理、違例泊車如果並未造成很嚴重的阻塞，而司機亦都願意立即駛走，在這些情況下警方都有一個詳盡的指引執法。

主席，是次建議的罰款額的調整，相較過去三十多年的通脹率，加幅相對溫和。在考慮的時候，我們希望做到情理兼備，既有助加強阻嚇作用，亦保障交通安全和交通暢順，同時已充分考慮運輸業界的經營情況。收費調整永遠沒有一個好的時機，但是多年不調整的話，會令阻嚇力有所減低。我們希望透過這次修例，再配以我剛才所述的不同的措施，持續去加強道路的安全和提升交通管理上的效率。

主席，我懇請各位議員支持並通過這兩項決議案。多謝主席。"

立法會：商務及經濟發展局副局長就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 18:52,2025-07-30 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000710.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局副局長陳百里博士今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上，就「積極拓展香港新經濟增長點」議員議案的開場發言：

代主席：

我感謝容海恩議員提出這項動議，亦感謝田北辰議員、陳曼琪議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案。

中共中央總書記、國家主席習近平於二○二五年三月五日全國兩會期間發表重要講話，提出要「守牢實體經濟這個根基，堅持推動傳統產業改造升級和開辟戰略性新興產業」。特區政府一直積極配合國家的戰略方向，把握香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，在鞏固傳統優勢產業的同時，積極開拓新經濟增長點，提升香港的競爭力及國際影響力，充分扮演「超級聯繫人」與「超級增值人」的角色。今日討論的議案與政府的政策方向不謀而合，在此方向下具體工作該如何部署？

首先，我們要做好深化國際交往合作這方面的工作。香港會繼續發揮內聯外通的獨特優勢，連接內地及全球市場，同時進一步拓展「全球南方」新興市場。除了恆常的資助計劃和支援措施，政府一直努力招商引資，並為港商創造有利條件積極開拓新興市場。有關工作主要分為三方面：

第一，加強區域合作。政府正馬不停蹄地與東南亞國家聯盟、中東及「一帶一路」沿線地區展開經貿合作，包括香港於去年三月與巴林簽訂促進和保護投資協定（投資協定），而香港與卡塔爾已大致完成投資協定談判，並正與沙特阿拉伯、孟加拉國、埃及和秘魯探討簽訂投資協定。同時，我們會繼續積極聯繫《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP）成員，透過不同平台及場合進行游說，爭取盡快加入RCEP，讓香港貢獻力量，促進區域經濟融合發展。

第二，建構高增值供應鏈。因應部分供應鏈正向「全球南方」及「一帶一路」沿線國家遷移，以及內地企業積極「走出去」的趨勢，投資推廣署和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）在去年十二月已建立高增值供應鏈服務機制，聯手吸引內地企業到香港建立管理離岸貿易和供應鏈的國際或區域總部，並為在港企業提供一站式專業諮詢服務，以協助它們「走出去」重新部署其環球供應鏈。該機制有助香港深化國際交往合作，同時有助開拓新經濟增長點。

第三，推進「一帶一路」建設。香港會繼續發揮作為「一帶一路」功能平台的角色。行政長官於今年五月率領50多位香港商貿代表和內地企業代表前往卡塔爾和科威特訪問，與中東地區進一步建立政府之間的關係、開拓合作領域擴大「朋友圈」。是次出訪成果相當理想，並達成了共59項合作備忘錄和協議合作，奠定多元基礎。

除了繼續努力深化與內地及國際市場的聯繫，政府亦會加強推動不同產業、不同領域的持續發展，包括創新科技、太空經濟、低空經濟、專業認證、清真產業、金融創新、綠色產業、文創產業及體育產業等方面。

在創新科技方面，政府以產業為導向，透過一系列措施推動香港創科發展及企業升級轉型，加快建設具有香港優勢的新實體經濟，並聚焦發展生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人，以及先進製造與新能源科技等具策略性意義的創科產業。

在太空經濟方面，國務院總理李強今年在《政府工作報告》提出了因地制宜發展新質生產力，開展新技術新產品新場景大規模應用示範行動，推進包括商業航天等的新產業。為配合國家發展新機遇，政府一直透過「創新及科技基金」支持各科技範疇的研究及發展，包括支援香港的大學和研發中心進行與航天相關的電子、數據處理和材料科學等範疇的研發。此外，政府已在InnoHK創新香港研發平台下成立香港太空機械人與能源中心。另外，為了讓業界更好把握低軌衞星作為全球衞星發展的新趨勢及當中的發展機遇，政府正進行簡化申請營辦低軌衞星牌照審批的研究工作，目標是在二○二五年內完成相關工作。

在低空經濟方面，財政司副司長領導的發展低空經濟工作組正以多管齊下的策略，全力構建智慧低空經濟生態圈。在應用層面上，我們透過推行「監管沙盒」試點項目，推動無人機技術在不同領域的突破性應用。法規方面，立法會剛於七月中通過有關擴大無人機規管範圍及開放載人飛行器試驗的法例修訂工作。工作組會繼續推進低空經濟基礎建設規劃及區域融合發展。

在清真產業方面，政府透過多方面提升香港在清真市場的競爭力。在吸引資金方面，政府已修訂法例，為發行伊斯蘭債券提供一個與傳統債券相若的稅務架構，並容許在政府債券計劃下發行伊斯蘭債券。至於貿易方面，貿發局一直就重點清真市場進行研究，為港商提供實用資訊。貿發局亦一直提供不同平台推動清真市場的商機，例如每年都在其美食商貿博覽推廣不同優質清真產品和食品，以及相關產品貿易，協助餐飲業拓展網絡和業務。另外，為推動旅遊業界提升穆斯林旅遊配套，香港旅遊發展局已積極與不同機構合作，透過提升穆斯林友善的旅遊設施；為酒店、景點和會議展覽場地進行相關評級；推動餐廳參與清真認證等，從而吸引更多穆斯林旅客訪港。

在專業認證服務方面，現時本地業界提供的專業認證服務已由電子電氣產品、建築材料等傳統產業拓展到環境、社會及管治、綠色金融等新興領域。政府一直和香港檢測和認證局緊密合作，透過多元化的線上線下宣傳和研討會等活動，協助業界針對性地推廣認證服務，發掘新商機。

在金融創新方面，為促進數字資產行業的可持續發展，繼政府在二○二三年六月實施數字資產交易平台發牌制度，《穩定幣條例》亦會於八月一日正式實施，為穩定幣發行人發牌訂下法定監管制度。政府亦正就其他數字資產活動規管範疇進行公眾諮詢，務求完善有關規管，助力市場健康發展。

在綠色產業方面，政府一直透過低碳綠色科研基金和「創新及科技基金」支援本地綠色科技發展，將具實際應用潛力的科研項目轉化為具商業價值的技術或產品，並在本地生產，長遠促進香港綠色產業發展。另外，香港作為區內綠色和可持續金融中心，正積極推動金融科技和綠色金融更好結合。其中，政府在「政府可持續債券計劃」下已成功發行合共約2,400億元等值的政府綠色債券，當中包括兩批代幣化綠色債券，分別是全球首批政府代幣化綠色債券及全球首批多貨幣計價數碼原生綠色債券，充分展示香港在結合債券市場、綠色和可持續金融，以及金融創新方面的優勢和領導地位。

在文化創意產業方面，政府正致力落實於去年十一月公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為經濟發展提供動力。其中一個發展方向是完善文藝創意產業生態圈，透過建立和拓展產業平台，促進跨界別和跨領域的合作。其中，政府以產業導向原則，培育具產業化潛質的文創項目，例如在剛完結的香港動漫電玩節中設立「香港國際潮玩博覽」、資助漫畫業界年度盛事「國際漫畫家大會」及「國際漫畫展」等，展現香港作為亞洲創意之都的地位，全方位支援產業化發展。

在體育產業方面，近年香港體育產業的規模正穩步擴展。根據二○二四年八月公布的資料，體育及相關活動在二○二二年以基本價格計算的增加價值約為380億元，較五年前增加11.8%。政府除了加強對精英運動員的支援和透過「M」品牌計劃吸引國際體育盛事在香港舉行，啟德體育園的落成為推動體育和周邊產業注入新動力，在推動本港體育全面發展的同時，帶動娛樂、演出及旅遊業等相關產業的發展，對促進體育產業化和推動經濟發揮積極作用。

結語

代主席，今日的議案涵蓋多個政策範疇，政府相關政策局和部門會通力合作，為有利經濟發展的範疇致力提供合適的政策和環境，我們亦非常歡迎議員的寶貴建議。接下來，我會細心聆聽各位議員的意見，稍後在總結發言時再詳細回應。代主席，我謹此陳辭。"
立法會：署理勞工及福利局局長就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 18:18,2025-07-30 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000683.htm,"以下是署理勞工及福利局（勞福局）局長何啟明今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案的總結發言全文：

代主席：

我再次感謝顏汶羽議員提出這項議案，以及梁子穎議員提出的修正案。同時，我感謝在座議員就這項議題表逹的意見及提出的建議，我會在此簡略回應。

正如我在開場發言所說，特區政府一直採取多管齊下的策略，以培育本地人才為主，引入外來人才為輔，豐富香港的人才庫，增強香港發展動能，主動對接國家「十四五」規劃及粵港澳大灣區建設，加快融入國家發展大局。

大灣區內城市有不同的優勢和定位，在人才培養、招攬、交流等方面有廣闊的合作空間。為了共同建設粵港澳大灣區人才高地，很多政策局及部門一直就相關行業致力推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，包括律政司、發展局、教育局、環境及生態局、醫務衞生局、房屋局、財經事務及庫務局以及勞福局。各政策局及部門都非常重視和關心灣區內人才流動的情況，會與相關行業的業界人士及團體緊密聯繫，了解行業最新發展及人力需求情況，並與其他大灣區城市負責單位商議，從而制定及優化相關措施。

在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）的框架下，內地已在絕大部分的服務貿易領域對香港實施優惠和便利措施，包括放寬香港專業人士提供服務的資質要求、准許香港專業人士在內地參加考試、註冊、執業和開業，以及鼓勵雙方的專業機構進行資格互認。目前，多個服務領域已設立專業資格互認或專業資格考試的考卷豁免安排，包括建築及相關工程、證券及期貨、銀行和房地產。

在建築及相關工程服務方面，正如剛才盧偉國議員提到，發展局與內地相關部門合作，允許合資格的香港工程、建築、測量、規劃和園境五個專業範疇的企業和專業人士，無須通過資格互認，只要完成簡單的備案程序，對應內地相應的資格，便可以到大灣區內地九市直接提供服務。另一方面，發展局與廣東省及澳門合作，就建造技術工人及技術人員的技術水平建立灣區標準，並推展「一試多證」安排。未來，我們會持續優化所需配套措施，支持粵港澳三地在建造業人才培育方面的合作，助力整個大灣區的建造業邁向更高質量發展。

在金融服務領域，政府一直致力建立金融人才庫，為業界創造發展動能。在CEPA框架下，內地與香港已就不同金融服務業的專業及行業資格推出開放措施，有利於內地金融人才來港發展。除了我較早前提到有關證券、基金及期貨行業，以及銀行業的資格互認機制，在會計專業方面，香港會計師公會與中國註冊會計師協會亦設有會計專業考試科目豁免安排。

地產代理服務方面，兩地的規管機構可分別推薦合資格地產代理及房地產經紀人參加由對方專門開設的培訓課程及考試。在完成課程及通過考試後，相關人士可申請在對方管轄範圍從事相關行業的資格。

在環境保護方面，香港在環境法規、國際認證及專業管理方面具有優勢。環境保護署（環保署）一直與相關專業學會合作，為環保相關科目的畢業生及年青環境專業人士提供實習培訓。剛才盧偉國議員提到，亦感謝你的推進，環保署計劃聯同香港合資格環保專業人員學會，與內地探索建立環保專業人員認證的可行性，以促進香港與大灣區內地城市的交流和合作。

而在爭議解決服務方面，粵港澳三地法律部門亦將爭取在今年內推出大灣區仲裁員名冊，以推動粵港澳大灣區仲裁員的人才連接，構建大灣區內多元化爭議解決機制。

代主席，雖然剛剛提到我們進行了許多工作，但當然很多工作仍有待推進，包括陳祖恒議員提到實習簽證的問題、周文港議員提到的學歷互認問題、黃俊碩議員提到「開小門而關小門」的問題，以及謝偉銓議員提到單一窗口的問題均仍待解決。然而，有些議員提出的問題我們已處理，包括剛才洪雯議員提到是否可透過香港引進國際領軍人才，其實今早在立法會前廳交流會上，政務司司長亦提到我們已釐定領軍人才引進機制，若各位議員物色到世界上頂尖的行業領軍人才，歡迎告訴我們，我們會主動出擊，以期將他們引來香港。

另外，黃錦輝議員提到能否讓職專學校的學生畢業後直接來港服務，其實在現行的職專畢業生留港計劃下已有類似操作安排，我們希望有更多非本地技術專才可以來到香港就讀職業訓練局，然後在港就業及紮根。我們會繼續與內地相關機構發展並完善類似安排。

政府各政策局及部門會繼續因應各行業最新發展及人力需求情況，制定及優化相應的培訓策略和措施，提升相關行業人才的職業和專業技能。此外，職業訓練局及僱員再培訓局亦提供全面的職業專才教育及培訓服務，提升本地勞動力的整體競爭力。

優質的人才是發展的重要動能，也是世界各地爭相競逐的對象。大灣區內城市各有不同優勢和定位，香港會繼續與其他大灣區城市攜手引才、留才、育才、用才，對接國家「十四五」規劃及粵港澳大灣區建設，加快融入國家發展大局。特區政府感謝各位議員對這項議題的重視和關心，各政策局和部門會繼續與業界人士及團體保持緊密溝通，並與其他大灣區城市負責單位聯繫和商議，推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，促進區域人才流動。

多謝主席。"

有意見認為隨着《2024年保護海港（修訂）條例草案》於本年五月獲本會通過，以及當局已邀請香港鐵路有限公司研究將紅磡站南面的臨海及前碼頭用地打造成設有遊艇會的海濱新地標，九龍城區海濱可望透過連接黃埔、土瓜灣和啟德等地區而得以貫通，而海濱區更可延伸至尖沙咀和觀塘海濱長廊，是政府建立「全民海濱」的重要契機。同時，由於啟德體育園落成及啟德跑道區持續發展，海濱區將吸引大量市民及遊客，周邊區域的交通配套及接駁設施的需求將大幅增加。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有何具體方案和時間表處理現時九龍城區海濱的斷點問題，包括翔龍灣煤氣調壓站、海心公園魚尾石一帶及青洲英泥碼頭私人地段；

（二）如何評估現時啟德區（尤其是跑道區）交通配套的不足之處；有何計劃改善該區的交通連接，包括水上交通和陸路接駁，以提升區域暢達性及應對大型盛事舉辦時的人流需求；

（三）如何解決舊區與海濱之間連接不足的問題；會否與市區重建局協調，在重建項目中加強行人系統網絡，以提升舊區與海濱的連接性；

（四）當局有何初步構思善用九龍城海濱水域資源；會否考慮發展水上活動設施，以配合啟德體育園及「青年驛站」旅舍的建設；及

（五）如何評估九龍城區的歷史文化資源與海濱發展的協同效應；有何計劃將該區內的歷史文化元素融入海濱發展？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直與海濱事務委員會緊密合作，推動各項優化維港海濱的工作，為公眾營造多元、活力、暢達和共融的海濱空間。就李議員關注的尖沙咀至啟德海濱發展而言，在長約15公里的可發展海濱長廊當中，目前已駁通將近七成，二○二八年年底將駁通近八成半。此外，我們會持續提升區內的海濱設施，例如於七月中開放紅磡都市公園（第二期），最近亦建議在發展紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地時，在紅磡繞道底臨海一段進行小規模填海工程，善用修訂的《保護海港條例》（第531章）的拆牆鬆綁機制興建新行人板道以連接尖沙咀海濱長廊與紅磡海濱長廊，以及優化海濱與內陸的行人連接，加強區域暢達性。

就提問各部分，經諮詢運輸及物流局、文化體育及旅遊局、民政及青年事務局和九龍城民政事務處後，現回覆如下：

（一）就李議員提及的三個地點，發展局目前有以下構思：

（i）海心公園內魚尾石一帶的海濱：魚尾石臨海一段是維港兩岸僅存的自然海岸線之一，我們認為應予以保留，現階段沒有計劃進行填海工程。現時魚尾石後方已設有行人通道連接海心公園擴建部分的海濱長廊，我們會繼續與康樂及文化事務署探討優化現有行人通道的方案及可行性，進一步改善魚尾石一帶海濱的通達性。

（ii）土瓜灣翔龍灣對開臨海煤氣設施用地：現時該臨海位置的煤氣調壓站及用作運送煤氣原材料石腦油的碼頭仍在運作中。我們與業權人一直保持溝通，探討在不影響上述設施的情況下開通一條行人通道的可能性。土木工程拓展署正就不同行人連接方案，進行定量風險評估，目標在今年內完成。

（iii）紅磡青洲英泥碼頭一帶海濱地段：所涉部分地段的業權已分散賣出，而且部分地段按地契享有進出航道的權利，因此要打通臨海地段存在較多複雜性，較另外兩個地點需要較長時間處理。政府會先探討以非填海的方案貫通該處一帶海濱，包括如業權人有意將用地作與海濱發展相符的用途，政府樂意共同探討可行方案，以期達致共贏的局面。然而，若最終證明這些非填海方案並不可行，我們會研究在該處興建涉及小規模填海工程的行人板道的可能性。

我們會繼續採用「先易後難」的處理方式，改善以上三個海濱地點的暢達性，並把它們納入我們將在短期內展開的「東九龍海濱長廊研究」，以研究進一步貫通相關海濱段落。

（二）運輸及物流局一直因應九龍城區海濱的整體規劃及項目落成進度，持續協調各公共交通營辦商提供服務。啟德發展區一帶現時已接駁至港鐵網絡，加上附近的主幹道和連接路（包括太子道東、承啟道、承豐道等）目前有超過50條巴士及專線小巴路線，方便區內居民往返港九新界各區。運輸署亦已計劃新增兩條專營巴士路線，由啟德郵輪碼頭開出，途經啟德跑道區，分別提供直達紅磡與尖沙咀的特快服務及前往宋皇臺站及啟德站的接駁服務。此外，運輸及物流局正全力推展啟德智慧綠色集體運輸系統，以連接啟德跑道區至啟德站。該局預計今年下半年為項目招標，以期在二○二六年批出合約。水路交通方面，現時「北角—觀塘—啟德」渡輪航線，於周末及公眾假期的航班會停靠啟德跑道區。

就應對於啟德體育園舉辦大型活動的人流需求上，運輸署會與啟德體育園、活動主辦單位及公共交通營運商等保持密切聯繫，在交通管理方面及早作出準備和部署。視乎活動的規模及觀眾的需要，政府及公共交通營運商會加強鐵路服務、開辦特別巴士服務（包括本地和跨境服務），以及協調加強的士服務。

（三）一直以來，發展局會與市區重建局（市建局）溝通和協調，為重建項目加強行人系統網絡，方便市民的日常生活，為社區帶來裨益。就土瓜灣方面，市建局於今年三月委聘顧問展開「土瓜灣海濱研究」，其中一個研究目的正是加強內陸與海濱空間連接，探討藉着市區更新項目改善舊區環境和道路網絡，加強土瓜灣舊區與海濱的連接性和暢達性。市建局預計顧問團隊將於下半年提交初期研究報告及可行性研究建議。我們會就如何加強內陸與海濱之間連接，與市建局協調合作。

（四）為了善用九龍城區及其附近地區的海濱資源，政府進行了不同工作。在發展水上活動設施方面，三個位於觀塘避風塘海濱用地的水上訓練中心已投入運作，近日有不同團體在該處附近水域舉辦各式各樣的本地及國際水上運動／康樂活動／訓練課程，善用該處水體，增添九龍東海旁的活力及吸引力。

在善用水體方面，發展局轄下的起動九龍東辦事處與海事處已共同制定《共享觀塘避風塘指引》，推廣船隻及水上康樂活動於非颱風日子安全共用避風塘。此外，海事處已於二○一八年將觀塘避風塘沿觀塘海濱花園的通航區由50米擴闊一倍至約100米，以䆁放更多空間作水上康樂活動。政府亦會繼續與相關持份者如體育總會及啟德「青年驛站」的營運團體保持緊密聯繫，以善用毗鄰的維港海濱和水體資源。

（五）由政務司副司長任組長的發展旅遊熱點工作組在今年五月公布九個旅遊熱點項目，當中包括「特色社區之香港龍城深度遊」。「深度遊」項目以《九龍城寨光影之旅》電影場景展為出發點，透過包裝並推介不同具特色的旅遊路線，延伸旅客在九龍城區內的體驗。九龍城區是多元文化與新舊共融的特色社區，九龍城民政事務處將善用區內的歷史文化資源，設計別具香港特色的深度旅遊體驗。旅遊路線將涵蓋不同的歷史文化主題，例如寨城歷史、泰潮文化、歷史古蹟以及啟德機場回憶等，吸引旅客和市民沿着主題路線探索不同景點，包括牛棚藝術村和海心公園等毗鄰海濱的歷史文化景點。隨着九龍城臨海用地陸續重建發展，包括香港房屋協會的資助房屋項目，以及毗鄰的市區重建項目，將提供更多優質公共空間予市民享用，我們會邀請有關發展單位積極考慮把九龍城區內歷史文化元素融入海濱的空間。"
LCQ20: Development of harbourfront of Kowloon City District,2025-07-30 18:15,2025-07-30 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000633.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Starry Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

There are views that as the Protection of the Harbour (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed by this Council in May this year, and the authorities have invited the Mass Transit Railway Corporation Limited to conduct a study to develop the waterfront and former pier sites to the south of Hung Hom Station into a new harbourfront landmark with yacht club, it is hoped that the harbourfront of Kowloon City District can realise connectivity through linking up areas such as Whampoa, To Kwa Wan and Kai Tak, and that the harbourfront zone can even be extended to the harbourfront of Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwun Tong. This serves as an important opportunity for the Government to develop a ""Harbourfront for the People"". At the same time, given the completion of the Kai Tak Sports Park and the continuous development of the runway area of Kai Tak, the harbourfront zone will attract a large number of members of the public and tourists, and the demand for ancillary transport facilities and connection facilities in the surrounding areas will increase substantially. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific proposal and timetable for addressing the existing disconnection problem in the harbourfront of Kowloon City District, including the gas offtake station off Grand Waterfront, the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock in Hoi Sham Park, and the private section of the Green Island Cement Pier;

(2) how it evaluates the inadequacies of the existing ancillary transport facilities in Kai Tak area (especially the runway area); of the plans in place to improve transport connectivity in the area, including waterborne transport and land transport, so as to enhance the accessibility of the area and cope with the demand arising from pedestrian flow when mega events are taking place;

(3) how it will address inadequate connectivity between old districts and the harbourfront; whether it will coordinate with the Urban Renewal Authority to enhance the network of pedestrian systems in redevelopment projects, so as to enhance connectivity between old districts and the harbourfront;

(4) of the authorities' preliminary ideas on optimising the use of water resources at the harbourfront of Kowloon City; whether the development of water sports facilities will be considered for supporting the construction of the Kai Tak Sports Park and ""Youth Post"" hostel; and

(5) how it evaluates the synergy between the historical and cultural resources and harbourfront development in Kowloon City District; of the plans in place to incorporate the historical and cultural elements of the district into harbourfront development?

Reply:

President,

The Government has been working closely with the Harbourfront Commission to promote various initiatives to enhance the Victoria Harbourfront, with a view to creating a diversified, vibrant, accessible and inclusive harbourfront space for the public. Regarding the harbourfront development from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kai Tak that Dr the Hon Lee is concerned with, out of the developable promenade of approximately 15 kilometres, nearly 70 per cent has been connected so far, and around 85 per cent is expected to be connected by the end of 2028. In addition, we will continue to improve harbourfront facilities in the district, such as the opening of the Hung Hom Urban Park (Phase 2) in mid-July, as well as recent proposal to make good use of the streamlined mechanism under the amended Protection of the Harbour Ordinance (Cap. 531) to carry out small scale reclamation underneath the waterfront section of the Hung Hom Bypass when developing the sites around Hung Hom Station and waterfront areas, with a view to connecting the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront promenade with the Hung Hom waterfront promenade through construction of a new boardwalk, and also strengthening the pedestrian connectivity between the harbourfront and the inland areas for enhancing the accessibility across regions.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB), the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau and the Kowloon City District Office (KCDO), the reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Regarding the three locations mentioned by Dr the Hon Lee, the latest views of the Development Bureau (DEVB) are as follows:

(i) for the waterfront in the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock in Hoi Sham Park: We consider that being one of the only remaining natural shorelines along the Victoria Harbour, the waterfront section of Fishtail Rock should be retained and there are no plans for reclamation at this stage. Currently, there is a pedestrian connection behind the Fishtail Rock connecting to the promenade of the Hoi Sham Park Extension. We will continue to explore the options and feasibility for enhancing the existing pedestrian connection with the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, with a view to further improving the accessibility of the waterfront in the vicinity of the Fishtail Rock.

(ii) for the waterfront gas facility site off Grand Waterfront in To Kwa Wan: Currently, the gas offtake station and the jetty for transfer of naphtha, the raw material for production of gas, are still in operation. We have been liaising with the landowner to explore the possibility of providing a pathway at its lot under the condition that the operation of the above facilities would not be affected. The Civil Engineering and Development Department is conducting a quantitative risk assessment on various pedestrian connection options, with a target of completion within this year.

(iii) for the waterfront area near the Green Island Cement Pier in Hung Hom: Connecting the concerned waterfront area is more complex and requires more time to tackle than the other two locations due to the fact that the lots therein are under multiple ownership with various owners, and certain parts of these lots have access to the sea according to the relevant leases. The Government would at the moment explore non-reclamation options to connect the harbourfront area, including the case where the concerned owners intend to use the site for a purpose consistent with the harbourfront development, the Government is willing to explore feasible solutions collaboratively with a view to achieving a win-win situation. However, should the non-reclamation options be proven not feasible in the end, we will study the possibility of a boardwalk with small scale reclamation.

We will continue to adopt the approach of ""tackling the simple issues first before the difficult ones"" to improve accessibility of the three waterfront locations above, and will incorporate them into the Study on East Kowloon Harbourfront Trail to be commenced in the near future, to examine further connecting the relevant harbourfront sections.

(2) The TLB has been co-ordinating with various public transport operators to provide services in line with the overall planning and progress of the completion of the various projects along the Kowloon City harbourftont. The Kai Tak Development Area (KTDA) is now connected to the MTR network, and together with the main roads and connecting roads in its vicinity (including Prince Edward Road East, Shing Kai Road, Shing Fung Road, etc.) are currently served by over 50 franchised bus and green minibus (GMB) routes, making it convenient for residents to travel to and from different districts on the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories. The Transport Department (TD) has also planned to introduce two new franchised bus routes, which will provide express service from the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal via the Kai Tak Runway Area (KTRA) to Hung Hom/Tsim Sha Tsui direct and connecting service to Sung Wong Toi Station and Kai Tak Station respectively. In addition, the TLB is implementing the Smart and Green Mass Transit System in Kai Tak (the Project) in full swing for connecting the KTRA to the Kai Tak Station. It is targeted to invite tender for the Project in the second half of 2025 for awarding the contract in 2026. In terms of water transport, currently the ""North Point–Kwun Tong–Kai Tak"" ferry route calls at the KTRA on weekends and public holidays.

To cope with the demand arising from pedestrian flow when mega events are taking place in the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), the TD will maintain close communication with the KTSP, event organisers and public transport operators to make advance preparations and arrangements in terms of transportation management. Depending on the scale of events and the needs of the spectators, the Government and public transport operators will strengthen rail services, introduce special bus services (including local and cross-boundary services) and co-ordinate enhanced taxi services.

(3) The DEVB and the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) have all along been maintaining close communication and co-ordination to strengthen the pedestrian network in redevelopment projects, facilitating citizens' daily lives and benefiting the community. Regarding To Kwa Wan, the URA commissioned consultants in March this year to launch the To Kwa Wan Harbourfront Study. One of the study's objectives is to strengthen the connection between the inland area and the harbourfront, explore measures to improve the environment of old district and the road network through urban renewal projects, thereby enhancing the connectivity and accessibility between the To Kwa Wan old district and the harbourfront. The URA expected the consultant team to submit a preliminary study report and feasibility study proposals in the second half of this year. We will co-ordinate and join forces with the URA on exploring ways to enhance connectivity between inland areas and the waterfront.

(4) The Government has undertaken various initiatives to leverage harbourfront resources in the Kowloon City District and its adjacent areas. Regarding the development of water sports facilities, three water sports training centres at waterfront sites around the Kwun Tong Typhoon Shelter (KTTS) have come into operation. Recently, different organisations have organised a variety of local and international water sports/recreational activities/training courses at the water bodies near KTTS, effectively utilising the water bodies and enhancing the vibrancy and attractiveness of the Kowloon East waterfront.

In respect of making good use of the water bodies, the Energizing Kowloon East Office under the DEVB and the Marine Department have jointly promulgated the Guidelines for Co-using KTTS to promote water body co-use between vessels and water recreational activities in the KTTS during non-typhoon days. Besides, the Marine Department has widened the passageway in KTTS along Kwun Tong Promenade from 50 m to about 100 m in 2018 to allow more space for water recreational activities. The Government will continue to maintain close communication with relevant stakeholders, such as sports associations and the operator of the ""Youth Post"" in Kai Tak, to optimise the use of the adjacent Victoria Harbourfront and water resources.

(5) The Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, announced nine tourist hotspot projects in May 2025, among which is ""Featured community - In-depth travel in Kowloon City"". Taking the ""Kowloon Walled City: A Cinematic Journey"" Movie Set Exhibition as the starting point, this project curates and promotes several unique travel routes to enhance tourists' experience in Kowloon City District. Kowloon City District is a distinctive neighbourhood with multicultural background and the blend of old and new elements. The KCDO will leverage the historic and cultural resources in the district to design in-depth travel experiences that showcase the unique character of Hong Kong. These travel routes will feature various historical and cultural themes, such as the history of the Kowloon Walled City, Thai and Chiu Chow cultures, historic sites and the legacy of Kai Tak airport, and will encourage both tourists and the public to explore different attractions along the thematic routes, such as the Cattle Depot Artist Village and Hoi Sham Park, along with other historic and cultural attractions adjacent to the harbourfront. With the progressive redevelopment of waterfront sites in Kowloon City, including the subsidised housing projects of the Hong Kong Housing Society and the urban renewal initiatives nearby, more quality public spaces will be provided for public enjoyment. We will invite the relevant development bodies to actively consider incorporating the historical and cultural elements of the Kowloon City District into the harbourfront spaces."

LCQ14: Measures to assist young people in home ownership,2025-07-30 18:05,2025-07-30 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000565.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a written reply by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, who is undertaking the duties of the Secretary for Housing, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 In recent years, the current-term Government has actively encouraged young people to move up the housing ladder and has put in place a number of measures to assist young people in home ownership. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the applicants for the White Form Secondary Market Scheme 2024 (WSM 2024), of the number of young applicants under the Youth Scheme (WSM) and their percentage, with a breakdown by age group (i.e. aged 18 to 29 and aged 30 to 39);

(2) out of the 6 000 quota under WSM 2024, of the number of those ultimately allocated to applicants aged under 40; whether the authorities will further increase the quota for the Youth Scheme (WSM) in the light of the response received and the demand of young people for home ownership;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the respective numbers of applications for 80 per cent and 90 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage loans under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) in each of the past five years, and the respective percentages of such numbers in the total number of new mortgage loans approved each year; among the applicants for 80 per cent and 90 per cent LTV mortgage loans, of the number of young applicants aged under 40;

(4) given that the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) announced in August last year a new arrangement, in which a waiver of the owner occupancy requirement under MIP will be granted to an eligible homeowner (such as a homeowner's family expecting newborn(s), resulting in a change in housing needs) for renting out the property, whether the Government knows if HKMCI will consider enhancing such measure (such as expanding the eligibility criteria from families with newborn(s) to include families with young child or children as well), thereby enabling more young families to change residence based on family needs;

(5) as it is learnt that some young families who previously acquired mortgage loans with a high LTV ratio through MIP find it difficult to replace their properties due to property price adjustments, and some even find themselves in negative equity, thus affecting their life planning, whether the Government has conducted surveys and studies, compiled statistics, and monitored on how such situation has impacted young families, and taken timely measures to prevent the problem from worsening; and

(6) whether it will further assist young people in home ownership under the subsidised housing policies, such as adjusting the proportion of subsidised housing supply, extending the Youth Scheme to subsidised housing provided by the Hong Kong Housing Society, and increasing the annual number of applications that can be made for subsidised housing and the proportion of larger flats available, thereby making subsidised housing an important channel for young people to purchase their first home?

Reply:

President,

 Since taking office, the current-term Government has actively implemented multiple measures to ""enhance speed, quantity, efficiency and quality"" in public housing supply. With our unremitting efforts, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply has completely turned around. Coupled with 30 000 Light Public Housing units, the total public housing supply in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is 85 per cent higher than that of the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27), providing a solid foundation for citizens to live and work in contentment. The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has also been striving to enhance the housing ladder by assisting low- to middle-income families to purchase their own homes through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF), and encouraging them to move up the housing ladder as appropriate according to their own affordability.

 We notice that many young people are working hard to achieve upward mobility through accumulation of experience and savings. Among buyers of various types of SSF, young people under the age of 40 have always been the majority. For instance, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are under the age of 40. Around 80 per cent of applicants and buyers under the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are also young people under the age of 40. In fact, the selling prices of SSF are affordable for young people. Taking HOS 2024 as an example, after applying the affordability benchmarks calculation, the flats are sold at around 70 per cent of the market price. Based on the average selling price, a flat of about 380 square feet in saleable area costs only around $2.7 million. As the HA provides a mortgage default guarantee for buyers of SSF, generally, White Form buyers can secure a mortgage loan at 90 per cent of the flat price. Assuming an interest rate at 3.5 per cent and a 30-year mortgage term, young people would only need to make a down payment of about $270,000, with monthly mortgage payments of $10,900, to become homeowners.

 To further assist young people, the HA has introduced a series of measures to facilitate their flat purchase. First, starting from the next HOS sale exercise, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 with White Form status. As for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has increased the quota to 6 000 by 1 500, all of which will be allocated to young family and one-person applicants under the age of 40.

 Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), as a close partner of the Government in housing policies, also fully supports the Government's relevant housing initiatives in helping young people realise their home ownership aspirations, including the allocation of an additional ballot number to White Form young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 for the purchase of SSF. The HKHS will continue to make reference to the relevant arrangements of the HA and actively work towards the same.

 In addition, the Government also assists those higher-income persons who are not eligible for HOS and yet cannot afford private housing to achieve their home ownership aspirations through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below.

 Besides providing various types of subsidised housing, the Government has also implemented other measures to assist citizens in home purchase. The current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden. Meanwhile, to provide comprehensive support for citizens and young people who have aspirations in purchasing flats, the Government has since February 26, 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million to $4 million. As for SSF, since most units are priced below $4 million (taking HOS 2024 as an example, the average selling price is around $2.7 million), buyers may thus benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings to nearly $60,000.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:

(1) During the application period of WSM 2024, the HA received a total of around 34 000 applications. The oversubscription rate is about five times, reflecting the persistent strong demand for second hand SSF of citizens. Among all of the applications received, over 80 per cent came from young applicants opting to join the newly implemented Youth Scheme (WSM), showing that the scheme was well received by the young applicants. Regarding the number and age distribution of young applicants who opted for the Youth Scheme (WSM) under WSM 2024, please refer to Annex 1.

(2) Balloting for WSM 2024 was conducted in April 2025. The HA expects that approval letters will be issued to successful applicants in the third/fourth quarter of 2025. Within the specified period, holders of the approval letters may apply for Certificate of Eligibility to Purchase (valid for 12 months) to purchase a SSF with premium unpaid. The HA will continuously monitor factors including the quota utilisation, demand for SSF, overall market conditions, etc, to make timely adjustments to both the total number of quota and the allocations under the Youth Scheme (WSM).

(3) The MIP is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. When approving residential mortgage loans, banks have to comply with LTV requirement on owner-occupied residential mortgage lending, which is currently set at 70 per cent. With the MIP providing mortgage insurance to banks, banks can provide mortgage loans with higher LTV ratio (i.e. above 70 per cent) without incurring additional credit risk. As long as an application meets the relevant eligibility criteria, the bank can generally provide a mortgage loan of up to 80 per cent LTV ratio under the MIP. For first-time homebuyers with fixed salaries, the maximum LTV ratio can even reach 90 per cent, substantially reducing the down payment burden for homebuyers.

 The numbers of new loans drawn down under the MIP in the past five years (categorised by LTV ratio), and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 2.

 Among above new loans drawn down, the numbers of cases involving at least one homeowner aged below 40, and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (categorised by LTV ratio) (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 3.

(4) In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement). The new arrangement has been implemented for around one year smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. Under the new arrangement, in addition to the situation that the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s)/adopting child or children or the homeowner has become unemployed, any homeowner who has other special needs and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months may also submit an application to the HKMCI through a bank for renting out the self-occupied property. The existing mechanism already allows homeowners who have young children and are able to meet the self-occupancy requirement to submit applications for renting out their self-occupied properties based on their special needs. The HKMCI will consider approving the relevant applications on a case-by-case basis.

(5) The objective of the MIP is to promote home ownership and provide citizens with an additional option for financing. As the fluctuation of the property market is subject to various factors, citizens should take into consideration their needs for home ownership and repayment capability, and assess the risks carefully.

(6) As mentioned above, both the HA and the HKHS are making relentless efforts to optimise various arrangements to help young people with home ownership aspirations strive to climb onto the home ownership ladder. The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HA would adjust the ratio between public rental housing (PRH) (including Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats) and SSF from 7:3 to 6:4 in order to increase the supply of SSF. In the next five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), the HA and the HKHS will complete about 56 500 SSF. Meanwhile, the HA is implementing the arrangement announced in the 2022 Policy Address regarding the minimum floor area for new flats. The saleable area of all SSF completed from 2026-27 onwards will be no less than 26 square metres in general. Furthermore, in the latter part of the coming decade, we will reserve 10 per cent increase in floor area for public housing. We are also exploring other measures to further assist young people in purchasing SSF and the measures will be launched in a timely manner. That said, we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to young people once again to unleash their potential and create a more prosperous future, but not to limit their room for development just for the sake of meeting the eligibility criteria for PRH application. In the past five years (i.e. 2020-21 to 2024-25), the average age of non-elderly one-person applicants that were housed to PRH was 57 years old. After understanding the above opportunities and support provided by the Government for young people, young people should plan ahead of time so as to climb higher up the housing ladder."
立法會十四題：協助青年置業的措施,2025-07-30 18:05,2025-07-30 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000554.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上梁毓偉議員的提問和政務司副司長兼任房屋局局長卓永興的書面答覆：

問題：

本屆政府近年積極鼓勵青年在房屋階梯向上流動，並採取多項措施協助青年置業。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在「白表居屋第二市場計劃2024」（「白居二2024」）的申請者中，「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者的人數及其所佔百分比為何，並按年齡組別（即18歲至29歲及30歲至39歲）列出分項資料；

（二）「白居二2024」的6 000個名額中，最終編配予40歲以下申請者的數目為何；當局會否因應該計劃的反應和青年的置業需求，進一步增加青年計劃（白居二）的名額；

（三）有否統計過去五年，每年按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）下的八成及九成按揭貸款的申請數目，以及該等數目佔每年新批出按揭貸款個案總數的百分比分別為何；八成及九成按揭貸款的申請者中，有多少人屬40歲以下青年；

（四）鑑於去年八月香港按證保險有限公司（按保公司）宣布一項新安排，合資格業主（例如業主家庭將有新生嬰兒而導致住屋要求改變）可獲豁免按保計劃下的業主自住要求並將物業出租，政府是否知悉按保公司會否考慮優化有關措施（例如將受惠資格由新生嬰兒家庭擴展至涵蓋有年幼子女家庭），從而使更多青年家庭可按家庭需要轉換居所；

（五）據悉部分以往利用按保計劃申請高成數按揭置業的青年家庭，因樓價調整而難以換樓，甚至出現負資產，影響其人生規劃，政府有否調研、統計及監察有關情況對青年家庭的影響，並適時作出措施防止問題惡化；及

（六）會否在資助房屋政策方面進一步協助青年置業，例如調整資助房屋供應比例、將青年計劃擴展至香港房屋協會的資助房屋，以及增加每年資助房屋可供申請次數及大單位的供應比例等，從而使資助房屋成為青年首次置業的重要渠道？

答覆:

主席：

本屆政府自上任以來，積極推展多項針對公營房屋供應「提速、提量、提效、提質」的措施。在我們不懈努力下，公營房屋供應已扭轉了「頭輕尾重」的情況。連同30000個「簡約公屋」單位在內，未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），總體公營房屋供應量將達197000伙，較本屆政府上任時的五年期（即二○二二／二三至二○二六／二七年度），大幅增加超過85%，為市民安居樂業提供堅實的基礎。香港房屋委員會（房委會）亦一直致力完善房屋階梯，透過出售資助單位協助中低收入家庭自置居所，鼓勵他們按自己的能力選擇合適的房屋階梯上流。

我們留意到不少青年人均努力工作，透過累積經驗及儲蓄，向上流動。在各類資助出售單位的買家中，40歲以下的青年人一直佔大多數。舉例而言，成功購買一手居者有其屋計劃（居屋）單位的申請者有近一半是40歲以下；約80%的「白表居屋第二市場計劃」（白居二）申請者及買家亦是40歲以下的青年人。事實上，資助出售單位的售價亦屬青年可負擔。以「居屋2024」為例，經以負擔能力基準計算後，單位是以相當於市價的七折發售。按平均售價計算，一個實用面積約380呎單位的售價只是約270萬元。由於房委會為購買資助出售單位的人士提供按揭貸款保證，一般而言白表買家可以取得單位售價九成的按揭貸款。以上述380呎的單位為例，假設利息為3.5%和按揭還款期為30年，青年只需付出約27萬元首期和每月供款10,900元，便可成為業主。

為進一步協助青年人，房委會推出了一系列助力置業的措施。首先，由下一期居屋銷售計劃開始，房委會會為40歲以下的白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼；而在第二市場方面，房委會亦已由「白居二2024」起，增加1500個配額至6000個，並將新增配額全數撥予40歲以下的青年家庭及一人申請者。

與此同時，香港房屋協會（房協）作為政府在房屋政策方面的緊密合作伙伴，亦全力支持政府在協助青年置業的相關房屋政策措施，包括為申請購買資助出售房屋的40歲以下白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼。房協將繼續參考房委會的相關安排，並積極配合。

另外，政府亦透過「港人首次置業」（「首置」）項目，協助既不符合申請居屋資格、又未能負擔私營房屋的較高收入人士，達到他們的置業期望。除了市區重建局首兩個已推售的「首置」項目（即「煥然懿居」第一和第二座，以及「煥然懿居」第三座）共售出超過600個「首置」單位，政府正推展另外數個「首置」項目，於未來數年起合共提供約5000個「首置」單位。而過去所推售「首置」單位的申請人以及最終買家，有大約85%是40歲或以下青年。

除了提供不同類型的資助房屋外，政府亦推行了其他措施協助市民置業。本屆政府自二○二四年二月起撤銷所有住宅物業需求管理措施；香港金融管理局亦自二○二四年十月起修訂了物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將最高物業按揭成數和「供款與入息比率」上限回復至二○○九年開始實施逆周期措施以前的水平——即不論物業價值，按揭成數上限一律調整至70%，供款與入息比率上限一律調整為50%——以便利不同置業需要的人士。個別人士更可按自身需要，透過按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）借取高成數的按揭貸款，其中有固定收入的首次置業人士購置價格1,000萬元或以下的物業，按揭成數可高達90%，大大減輕首期負擔。同時，政府自二○二五年二月二十六日起調整買賣或轉讓住宅及非住宅物業須繳付的從價印花稅的稅階，將徵收100元物業印花稅適用的物業價值上限由300萬元提高至400萬元，全方位協助有意置業的市民及青年。就資助出售單位而言，由於絕大部分單位的定價均低於400萬元（以「居屋2024」為例，單位平均售價為270萬元），買家已能受惠於上述印花稅降至100元的措施，最多可以節省近60,000元。

就梁毓偉議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局，我們現回覆如下：

（一）在「白居二2024」申請期內，房委會共收到約34000份申請，超額申請約為五倍，顯示市民對二手資助出售單位的需求持續殷切。所有申請中，超過80%為選擇參加今期新推出「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者，反映計劃相當受青年申請者歡迎。有關於「白居二2024」選擇參加「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者數目及年齡分布，詳見附件一。

（二）「白居二2024」已於2025年4月攪珠，房委會預計會於二○二五年第三／四季向成功申請者發出批准信。批准信持有人可在指定日期內申請「購買資格證明書」（有效期12個月），以便購買未補價的資助出售單位。房委會會持續檢視配額使用情況、資助出售單位的需求，以及整體市場情況等因素，適時調整整體配額數量及「青年計劃（白居二）」名額。

（三）按保計劃由香港按證保險有限公司﹙按證保險公司）經營，以協助市民在香港安居置業。銀行在敍造住宅物業按揭貸款的時候，須遵守按揭成數上限的規定，而現時的按揭成數上限為70%。按保計劃則為銀行提供按揭保險，使銀行可以提供較高成數（即70%以上）的按揭貸款而毋須承擔額外的風險。在按保計劃下，只要申請個案符合相關條件，銀行一般可以提供高達80%的按揭貸款；對於首次置業的固定受薪人士，按揭成數更可達到90%。置業人士的首期負擔因而可以大大減輕。

過去五年，每年按保計劃下新取用按揭貸款宗數（以按揭成數劃分），以及該等數目佔每年新取用按揭貸款個案總數的百分比（即括號內所述數字）載列於附件二。

在上述新取用按揭貸款當中，涉及至少一名40歲以下業主的宗數，以及該等數目佔每年新取用按揭貸款個案宗數（以按揭成數劃分）的百分比（即括號內所述數字）載列於附件三。

（四）按證保險公司於二○二四年八月在按保計劃下設立新安排，按個別情況考慮批准合資格業主將自住的物業出租，以協助他們應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要（新安排）。新安排推行接近一年，運作暢順，為有特別需要的業主提供實質協助。在新安排下，除了業主家庭將有新生嬰兒／領養兒童或業主失業的情況，業主如有其他特別需要而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月，亦可透過銀行向按證保險公司申請將自住物業出租。現行機制已容許有年幼子女並滿足自住要求的業主，就其特別需要提出將自住物業出租的申請。按證保險公司會按個別情況考慮批准相關個案。

（五）按保計劃的目的是協助市民置業安居，為他們提供多一個財務安排選擇。物業市場的波動受許多不同因素影響，市民須因應自己置業的需要及還款能力作出考慮，小心評估風險。

（六）如上述所言，房委會及房協不遺餘力地優化各項安排，以協助有置業夢想的年輕人奮力向上，踏上置業階梯。行政長官已在二○二四年《施政報告》公布，房委會會調整公共租住房屋（公屋）（包括綠表置居計劃單位）和資助出售單位的比例，由七比三逐步調整至六比四，增加資助出售單位的供應。在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），房委會和房協將共有約56500個資助出售單位落成。與此同時，房委會正落實二○二二年《施政報告》中有關新建單位面積「封底」的安排，即所有於二○二六／二七年度起落成的資助出售單位一般實用面積不會少於26平方米。此外，在未來十年期的較後時間，公營房屋的單位會預留10%的面積增長。我們亦正研究其他進一步協助青年購買資助房屋的措施，並會適時推出。然而，我們希望藉此機會再次呼籲年青人，應發揮潛力創造更豐盛的未來；萬勿為了符合申請公屋資格而限制自身的發展空間。過去五年（即二○二○／二一至二○二四／二五年度），獲編配公屋單位的非長者一人申請者平均年齡為57歲。青年人在了解上述政府為青年人提供的機會及支援後，應及早規劃以在房屋階梯攀得更高。"
LCQ14:Measures to assist young people in home ownership,2025-07-30 18:05,2025-07-30 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000565.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a written reply by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, who is undertaking the duties of the Secretary for Housing, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 In recent years, the current-term Government has actively encouraged young people to move up the housing ladder and has put in place a number of measures to assist young people in home ownership. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the applicants for the White Form Secondary Market Scheme 2024 (WSM 2024), of the number of young applicants under the Youth Scheme (WSM) and their percentage, with a breakdown by age group (i.e. aged 18 to 29 and aged 30 to 39);

(2) out of the 6 000 quota under WSM 2024, of the number of those ultimately allocated to applicants aged under 40; whether the authorities will further increase the quota for the Youth Scheme (WSM) in the light of the response received and the demand of young people for home ownership;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the respective numbers of applications for 80 per cent and 90 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage loans under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) in each of the past five years, and the respective percentages of such numbers in the total number of new mortgage loans approved each year; among the applicants for 80 per cent and 90 per cent LTV mortgage loans, of the number of young applicants aged under 40;

(4) given that the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) announced in August last year a new arrangement, in which a waiver of the owner occupancy requirement under MIP will be granted to an eligible homeowner (such as a homeowner's family expecting newborn(s), resulting in a change in housing needs) for renting out the property, whether the Government knows if HKMCI will consider enhancing such measure (such as expanding the eligibility criteria from families with newborn(s) to include families with young child or children as well), thereby enabling more young families to change residence based on family needs;

(5) as it is learnt that some young families who previously acquired mortgage loans with a high LTV ratio through MIP find it difficult to replace their properties due to property price adjustments, and some even find themselves in negative equity, thus affecting their life planning, whether the Government has conducted surveys and studies, compiled statistics, and monitored on how such situation has impacted young families, and taken timely measures to prevent the problem from worsening; and

(6) whether it will further assist young people in home ownership under the subsidised housing policies, such as adjusting the proportion of subsidised housing supply, extending the Youth Scheme to subsidised housing provided by the Hong Kong Housing Society, and increasing the annual number of applications that can be made for subsidised housing and the proportion of larger flats available, thereby making subsidised housing an important channel for young people to purchase their first home?

Reply:

President,

 Since taking office, the current-term Government has actively implemented multiple measures to ""enhance speed, quantity, efficiency and quality"" in public housing supply. With our unremitting efforts, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply has completely turned around. Coupled with 30 000 Light Public Housing units, the total public housing supply in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is 85 per cent higher than that of the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27), providing a solid foundation for citizens to live and work in contentment. The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has also been striving to enhance the housing ladder by assisting low- to middle-income families to purchase their own homes through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF), and encouraging them to move up the housing ladder as appropriate according to their own affordability.

 We notice that many young people are working hard to achieve upward mobility through accumulation of experience and savings. Among buyers of various types of SSF, young people under the age of 40 have always been the majority. For instance, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are under the age of 40. Around 80 per cent of applicants and buyers under the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are also young people under the age of 40. In fact, the selling prices of SSF are affordable for young people. Taking HOS 2024 as an example, after applying the affordability benchmarks calculation, the flats are sold at around 70 per cent of the market price. Based on the average selling price, a flat of about 380 square feet in saleable area costs only around $2.7 million. As the HA provides a mortgage default guarantee for buyers of SSF, generally, White Form buyers can secure a mortgage loan at 90 per cent of the flat price. Assuming an interest rate at 3.5 per cent and a 30-year mortgage term, young people would only need to make a down payment of about $270,000, with monthly mortgage payments of $10,900, to become homeowners.

 To further assist young people, the HA has introduced a series of measures to facilitate their flat purchase. First, starting from the next HOS sale exercise, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 with White Form status. As for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has increased the quota to 6 000 by 1 500, all of which will be allocated to young family and one-person applicants under the age of 40.

 Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), as a close partner of the Government in housing policies, also fully supports the Government's relevant housing initiatives in helping young people realise their home ownership aspirations, including the allocation of an additional ballot number to White Form young family and one-person applicants aged below 40 for the purchase of SSF. The HKHS will continue to make reference to the relevant arrangements of the HA and actively work towards the same.

 In addition, the Government also assists those higher-income persons who are not eligible for HOS and yet cannot afford private housing to achieve their home ownership aspirations through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below.

 Besides providing various types of subsidised housing, the Government has also implemented other measures to assist citizens in home purchase. The current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden. Meanwhile, to provide comprehensive support for citizens and young people who have aspirations in purchasing flats, the Government has since February 26, 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million to $4 million. As for SSF, since most units are priced below $4 million (taking HOS 2024 as an example, the average selling price is around $2.7 million), buyers may thus benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings to nearly $60,000.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:

(1) During the application period of WSM 2024, the HA received a total of around 34 000 applications. The oversubscription rate is about five times, reflecting the persistent strong demand for second hand SSF of citizens. Among all of the applications received, over 80 per cent came from young applicants opting to join the newly implemented Youth Scheme (WSM), showing that the scheme was well received by the young applicants. Regarding the number and age distribution of young applicants who opted for the Youth Scheme (WSM) under WSM 2024, please refer to Annex 1.

(2) Balloting for WSM 2024 was conducted in April 2025. The HA expects that approval letters will be issued to successful applicants in the third/fourth quarter of 2025. Within the specified period, holders of the approval letters may apply for Certificate of Eligibility to Purchase (valid for 12 months) to purchase a SSF with premium unpaid. The HA will continuously monitor factors including the quota utilisation, demand for SSF, overall market conditions, etc, to make timely adjustments to both the total number of quota and the allocations under the Youth Scheme (WSM).

(3) The MIP is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. When approving residential mortgage loans, banks have to comply with LTV requirement on owner-occupied residential mortgage lending, which is currently set at 70 per cent. With the MIP providing mortgage insurance to banks, banks can provide mortgage loans with higher LTV ratio (i.e. above 70 per cent) without incurring additional credit risk. As long as an application meets the relevant eligibility criteria, the bank can generally provide a mortgage loan of up to 80 per cent LTV ratio under the MIP. For first-time homebuyers with fixed salaries, the maximum LTV ratio can even reach 90 per cent, substantially reducing the down payment burden for homebuyers.

 The numbers of new loans drawn down under the MIP in the past five years (categorised by LTV ratio), and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 2.

 Among above new loans drawn down, the numbers of cases involving at least one homeowner aged below 40, and their respective proportions to the total number of new loans drawn down (categorised by LTV ratio) (i.e. figures in the brackets) are set out at Annex 3.

(4) In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement). The new arrangement has been implemented for around one year smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. Under the new arrangement, in addition to the situation that the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s)/adopting child or children or the homeowner has become unemployed, any homeowner who has other special needs and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months may also submit an application to the HKMCI through a bank for renting out the self-occupied property. The existing mechanism already allows homeowners who have young children and are able to meet the self-occupancy requirement to submit applications for renting out their self-occupied properties based on their special needs. The HKMCI will consider approving the relevant applications on a case-by-case basis.

(5) The objective of the MIP is to promote home ownership and provide citizens with an additional option for financing. As the fluctuation of the property market is subject to various factors, citizens should take into consideration their needs for home ownership and repayment capability, and assess the risks carefully.

(6) As mentioned above, both the HA and the HKHS are making relentless efforts to optimise various arrangements to help young people with home ownership aspirations strive to climb onto the home ownership ladder. The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HA would adjust the ratio between public rental housing (PRH) (including Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats) and SSF from 7:3 to 6:4 in order to increase the supply of SSF. In the next five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), the HA and the HKHS will complete about 56 500 SSF. Meanwhile, the HA is implementing the arrangement announced in the 2022 Policy Address regarding the minimum floor area for new flats. The saleable area of all SSF completed from 2026-27 onwards will be no less than 26 square metres in general. Furthermore, in the latter part of the coming decade, we will reserve 10 per cent increase in floor area for public housing. We are also exploring other measures to further assist young people in purchasing SSF and the measures will be launched in a timely manner. That said, we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to young people once again to unleash their potential and create a more prosperous future, but not to limit their room for development just for the sake of meeting the eligibility criteria for PRH application. In the past five years (i.e. 2020-21 to 2024-25), the average age of non-elderly one-person applicants that were housed to PRH was 57 years old. After understanding the above opportunities and support provided by the Government for young people, young people should plan ahead of time so as to climb higher up the housing ladder."

政府一直強調樓宇業主應妥善保養和維修樓宇，除了可延長樓宇的壽命，亦可避免因日久失修對住戶或公眾構成危險。一般而言，大廈公契作為私人合約訂明締約各方（即業主、經理人和發展商）之間的權利和責任，包括管理樓宇公用部分和其他相關事宜，以及相關維修費用的負擔等，部分公契亦會訂明外牆的業權和管理權。實際上，業主可透過成立業主立案法團（法團）、業主委員會，以及聘用持牌物業管理公司的方式，管理大廈公用部分（包括外牆）以及其他相關事宜。

《建築物管理條例》（第344章）亦有對管理和維修物業公用部分的責任作出規定。另外，市區重建局推行的樓宇復修綜合支援計劃，為樓宇業主提供財政資助和技術支援的一站式服務，包括支援業主為樓宇公用地方進行全面復修工程。民政事務總署亦會協助及支援法團，協助他們處理樓宇的管理事宜（包括樓宇外牆維修）。

就陳議員各部分的提問，經諮詢民政及青年事務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）由於樓宇不同部分的業權及其公用部分的管理責任由公契訂明，屬於私人合約協議，政府沒有統計全港有多少幢私人大廈的外牆沒有統一的業權持有人（包括部分或整體外牆業權不完整的大廈）。

由公司持有的物業，如果該公司根據《公司條例》（第622章）或《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）完成清盤程序並面臨解散，則在緊接解散前歸屬該公司或以信託形式為該公司持有的所有財產及權利（例如包括一些仍未在市場售出的物業），即屬無主財物並歸屬政府，其中的土地物業，即為「無主物業」（包括大廈外牆）。地政總署一般會以出售方式處理上述屬無主財物並歸屬政府的大廈外牆（無主外牆）的業權（詳見第二部分）。仍未售出的無主外牆，則會由地政總署繼續管理。

截至二○二五年六月，被地政總署接管並仍由其管理的無主外牆個案共有56宗，（按區議會分區）詳情載列於附件一。由於部分由地政總署接管的無主外牆只佔外牆整體業權的一部分，地政總署會根據大廈公契，按其接管的外牆的權益份額而承擔相應的管理及維修責任。

（二）地政總署一般會以出售方式處理其接管的無主物業，但由於外牆的業權不適合在公開市場出售，署方一般會邀請相關的大廈法團以象徵式費用（即1,000元）承接無主外牆的業權。自二○一○年至今，地政總署已成功將24宗無主外牆的業權轉售相關大廈法團，有關大廈名單詳列於附件二。

至於在第（一）部分提及的56宗現由地政總署管理的無主外牆個案中，地政總署已就當中13宗正式邀請大廈法團承接業權，但尚待相關法團回覆，有關樓宇大廈名單詳列於附件三；地政總署另正就42宗安排與相關法團就轉讓事宜進行初步磋商；餘下一宗個案則因大廈未有成立法團而暫未有轉售的計劃。至今沒有法團明確拒絕地政總署就無主外牆個案發出的邀請，地政總署會繼續與相關法團磋商轉讓事宜。

若果有大廈的外牆業權不統一（即並非由單一業主或公司持有）或不完整（例如有個別業權不清），一般而言，業主須根據大廈公契，由法團或業主共同磋商及承擔有關外牆管理及維修的責任。

（三）就由地政總署管理的無主外牆而言，地政總署的責任與其他業主無異。地政總署人員會定期視察外牆的狀況，如有需要，會安排工程承辦商進行適當維修，以確保其結構安全及妥當。根據地政總署的紀錄，由地政總署管理的無主外牆過往從未出現因失修以致途人受傷的個案。

（四）屋宇署一直採取多管齊下的措施保障私人樓宇的建築安全。不論業權狀況如何，如發現樓宇包括外牆對公眾構成即時危險，署方會安排政府承建商進行緊急工程，並在完成緊急工程後向業主追討工程的相關費用、監督費及附加費。換言之，有關費用最終應該是由業主而非署方承擔。

就上述第（一）部分提及由地政總署管理的無主外牆，並沒有出現即時危險而需由屋宇署介入或代維修的個案。"
LCQ17: Repair and maintenance of external walls of buildings,2025-07-30 17:30,2025-07-30 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000592.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

Some flat owners of buildings in old districts have relayed to me that titles to the external walls of many buildings in Hong Kong are held by the original developers of those buildings. However, quite a number of these developers have ceased operations over the years following completion of the buildings. The Government has assumed ownership of the external walls of buildings held by some of such developers after their liquidation. There are also cases in which the external walls of buildings are left unattended, be turned into ""abandoned structures"" and become dilapidated. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of private buildings in Hong Kong where titles to their external walls are not unified (including buildings with incomplete titles to part or the whole of their external walls); of the number of private buildings with titles to their external walls taken over by the Government due to the fact that the developer concerned has gone into liquidation, and the government departments involved in managing such titles, together with a breakdown of the names and numbers of such buildings by District Council (DC) district;

(2) how the Government will handle the issue concerning the responsibilities for repair and maintenance of the external walls arising from private buildings with incomplete titles to their external walls and those with titles to their external walls taken over by the Government as mentioned in (1), e.g. whether the Government has transferred the titles to the external walls under its possession to the owners' corporations (OC(s)) of the relevant buildings at nominal cost; if so, of the number of successful cases of title transfer, and the number of OCs refusing acceptance of such transfer, together with a breakdown by DC district;

(3) of the measures in place to ensure structural safety of the external walls of the buildings where titles to the external walls have been taken over by the Government; whether there have been cases in the past five years where dilapidated external walls of such buildings caused injuries to pedestrians and the Government was required to assume responsibility for compensation; if so, of the details; and

(4) how the Government will handle the situation mentioned in (1) above in which the titles to the external walls of buildings are incomplete while their external walls are posing immediate danger; whether the Government has assumed any responsibility for repair and maintenance and paid for the relevant works; if so, of the total amount of repairs or maintenance costs incurred by the Government in the past, together with a breakdown by DC district?

Reply:

President,

The Government has all along been emphasising that building owners should properly maintain and repair their buildings. Apart from extending the life of their buildings, danger to the occupants or the general public arising from dilapidation can also be avoided. Generally speaking, the Deeds of Mutual Covenant (DMCs) of a building, being a private contract, stipulate the rights and obligations among the parties concerned (i.e. owners, managers and developers), including management of the common parts of buildings and other related matters, as well as bearing of the relevant maintenance costs, etc. Some DMCs also specify the titles to and the management right of external walls. In fact, owners may manage the common parts (including external walls) of their buildings and other related matters by forming owners' corporations (OCs), owners' committees and engaging licensed property management companies.

The Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) also stipulates the responsibilities for management and maintenance of the common parts of a property. Moreover, the Urban Renewal Authority has launched an all-in-one Integrated Building Rehabilitation Assistance Scheme, providing financial assistance and technical support to building owners, including support for owners to carry out comprehensive maintenance works for the common areas of their buildings. The Home Affairs Department also provides assistance and support to OCs in handling building management matters (including maintenance of the external walls of buildings).

Our reply, prepared in consultation with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan is as follows:

(1) As the titles to different parts of buildings and the responsibilities for managing their common parts are stipulated in the DMCs, which are private contractual agreements, the Government has not compiled statistics on the number of private buildings in Hong Kong where titles to their external walls are not unified (including buildings with incomplete titles to part or the whole of their external walls).

For properties owned by companies, if the company, pursuant to the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) or the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32), completes the procedures for winding up and is about to dissolve, every property and right (such as including some properties that are yet to be sold in the market) vested in or held on trust for the company immediately before the dissolution is vested in the Government as bona vacantia. Among these, land properties are ""bona vacantia properties"" (including their external walls). In general, the Lands Department (LandsD) will dispose of the titles to the external walls (bona vacantia external walls) of the aforesaid buildings which are vested in the Government as bona vacantia by way of sale (please see part (2) for details). Unsold bona vacantia external walls will continue to be managed by the LandsD.

As of June 2025, there are a total of 56 cases involving bona vacantia external walls which have been taken over and are still managed by the LandsD, the details of which (by District Council district) are set out at Annex 1. Given some of the bona vacantia external walls taken over by the LandsD only account for a portion of the overall ownership of the external walls, the LandsD will shoulder the management and maintenance responsibilities corresponding to its share of interests in the external walls in accordance with the DMCs.

(2) In general, the LandsD will dispose of bona vacantia properties that it has taken over by way of sale. However, as the titles to external walls are not suitable for sale in the open market, the LandsD will normally invite the OC of the buildings concerned to take over the ownership of bona vacantia external walls at a nominal fee (i.e. $1,000). Since 2010, the LandsD has successfully transferred the titles of 24 cases of bona vacantia external walls to the OCs of the buildings concerned by sale. A list of these buildings is set out at Annex 2.

Among the 56 cases of bona vacantia external walls currently managed by the LandsD as mentioned in part (1), the LandsD has officially invited the OCs of the buildings concerned to take over the titles of 13 cases, but the OCs have yet to respond. A list of the buildings concerned is set out at Annex 3. The LandsD is arranging initial negotiation with the relevant OCs regarding the transfer of titles for the other 42 cases. As for the remaining case, there is no plan for transfer for the time being as no OC has been formed in the building. So far, no OC has explicitly rejected the offer regarding bona vacantia external walls, and the LandsD will continue to negotiate with the relevant OCs on the transfer matters.

Generally speaking, for buildings where titles to their external walls are not unified (i.e. not held by a single owner or company) or are incomplete (e.g. individual titles are unclear), the OCs or the owners should jointly negotiate and bear the responsibilities for management and maintenance of external walls in accordance with the DMCs.

(3) For bona vacantia external walls managed by the LandsD, the department bears the same responsibilities as other owners. The LandsD staff will inspect the conditions of external walls on a regular basis and, if necessary, will arrange for works contractors to carry out repairs as appropriate to ensure their structural safety and that they are in a good state. According to the records of the LandsD, there has not been any case of injuries to pedestrians due to dilapidation of bona vacantia external walls under its management.

(4) The Buildings Department (BD) has been adopting a multi-pronged approach to ensure the safety of private buildings. Regardless of ownership status, if it is found that a building, including its external walls, poses an imminent danger to the public, the BD will arrange for government contractors to carry out emergency works and subsequently recover the relevant works costs, supervision fees, and surcharges from the owners. In other words, the relevant fees should be ultimately borne by the owners, rather than the BD.

Regarding the bona vacantia external walls managed by the LandsD mentioned in part (1) above, none of the concerned cases require intervention or repair works by the BD due to imminent danger."

The tenancy agreement of market stalls renting on a first-come, first-served basis is a three-year fixed term from October 1, with no right of renewal upon expiry of the tenancy agreement. The upset prices of the monthly rent of the stalls vary depending on their sizes, locations, vacancy periods and the reduced upset prices from the last open auction of the individual stalls. Relevant information is available on the FEHD website after the open auction.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""Bidders or applicants for the market stalls must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. To allow more people to bid for or select the stalls and increase customer choices by enhancing the diversity in terms of the variety of stalls, there will be a restriction on the number of stalls to be rented in the same market by a single tenant. Any person who is currently a stall tenant is not allowed to bid in the first round of auction for any stall in the same market, and will only be allowed to bid for one stall in the second round of auction or to select one stall in the same market on a first-come, first-served basis. The existing tenants under the new three-year fixed term tenancy scheme (i.e. those persons who became stall tenants through the market open auctions after August 2022) are allowed to bid for a stall in the auction or select a stall on a first-come, first-served basis in the same market, but shall vacate the current stall and return it to the FEHD before the effective date of commencement of the new tenancy agreement.""

âDetails of the open auctions and the public market stalls concerned (including stalls for open auction at reduced upset prices) have been uploaded to the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/tidy_market/open_auction_coming.html). Details on renting public market stalls on a first-come, first-served basis will be uploaded to the FEHD website after open auctions (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/tidy_market/FCFS/index.html). Interested bidders or applicants may visit the department website or contact the respective District Environmental Hygiene Office."
"Government releases ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"" (with photos/video)",2025-07-30 16:45,2025-07-30 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000631.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (July 30) releasedthe ""Report on Hong Kong's Business Environment: Unique Strengths under 'One Country, Two Systems'"". The report provides all sectors of the community and Mainland and overseas investors with details on Hong Kong's latest developments and strengths, comprehensively showcasing Hong Kong's open, safe, stable, efficient and internationalised business environment. The report has been uploaded to the ""Hong Kong Economy"" website: www.hkeconomy.gov.hk/en/environment/index.htm.

   A Government spokesman said, ""Following the report issued in 2021, the HKSAR Government has published another relevant report. With solid facts and data, the latest report systematically and clearly demonstrates to the world that Hong Kong's development has been picking up in recent years as social stability has been restored and the city has emerged from the pandemic. It aims to deepen the understanding of friends and investors worldwide about the latest situation in various fields in Hong Kong, encouraging them to fully leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages of having connections to both the Mainland and the world under 'one country, two systems', its role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder', and to seize new opportunities that emerge.""

  The report elaborates on Hong Kong's institutional advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement and explains the Government's policy priorities and achievements in promoting high-quality economic development, including continuously strengthening competitiveness, as well as its achievements in attracting capital inflows, pooling together enterprises and attracting talent. It also showcases Hong Kong's latest developments and potential in finance, trade, aviation, maritime, innovation and technology, intellectual property trade, and legal services, as well as culture, sports and tourism.

  The spokesman said, ""Over the past few years, the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance has restored a stable social environment in Hong Kong. This has not only protected the rights and freedoms of the general public but has also made Hong Kong a safe harbour for attracting international capital and investment. The continued inflow of capital, the promising growth of the stock market, domestic and overseas companies setting up their presence in Hong Kong, talent pursuing development in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's top rankings in numerous international rankings demonstrate that Hong Kong's open, secure, stable and efficient business environment has been widely recognised internationally, and the confidence of international investors and businesses in Hong Kong is further growing.""

  In fact, the current-term Government has achieved remarkable results in attracting enterprises, investment and talent. For example, in 2024, the number of companies in Hong Kong with parent companies located outside the territory significantly increased by about 10 per cent, reaching nearly 10 000, while the number of start-ups reached nearly 4 700, both reaching record highs. The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, established over two years ago, has attracted 84 strategic enterprises to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong, including enterprises with a market capitalisation or valuation exceeding $10 billion and engaged in cutting-edge technologies. From January 2023 to the first six months of 2025, Invest Hong Kong assisted over 1 300 overseas and Mainland companies to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong, bringing in investment of more than $160 billion.

  In terms of talent, as of June 2025, a total of nearly 500 000 applications under various talent admission schemes were received, nearly 330 000 of which were approved, and nearly 220 000 talents have arrived in Hong Kong.

  This year, the performance of Hong Kong's financial markets has steadily improved. The Hang Seng Index recorded an increase of 18 per cent last year and an increase of more than 25 per cent this year so far. The average daily turnover in the stock market for the first half of the year was around $240 billion, with an increase of around 120 per cent. According to the Securities and Futures Commission's Asset and Wealth Management Activities Survey 2024 published this month, Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business showed further growth, with total assets under management at over $35 trillion as of end-2024, representing a year-on-year gain of 13 per cent.

  The spokesman said, ""In a complex and volatile external environment, Hong Kong is experiencing economic upgrading and transformation, but there are more opportunities than challenges. With the strong support from our country and the collective efforts of the Government, various sectors and residents, Hong Kong will leverage the advantages of the 'one country, two systems' arrangement and capitalise on national development opportunities. By developing innovation and technology and new quality productive forces, and deepening international and regional exchanges and co-operation, Hong Kong will pave the way for new growth prospects."""

政府發言人表示：「特區政府繼二○二一年後，再度發表相關報告。新一份報告以扎實的事實和數據，有系統地向外界清晰說明香港這幾年在社會穩定下來、走出疫情以後，持續向好的發展，讓世界各地的朋友及投資者，更深入了解香港不同領域的實況，鼓勵他們充分利用香港在『一國兩制』下內聯外通的獨特優勢，以及『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的功能，為他們所帶來的龐大機遇。」

報告詳述香港在「一國兩制」下的制度優勢，並說明政府推動經濟高質量發展的政策重點與成果，包括持續提升競爭力，以及吸引資金流入、匯聚企業、吸納人才的成績等，並展示香港在金融、貿易、航空、航運、創科、知識產權貿易、法律服務，以及文化、體育和旅遊等領域的最新發展和潛力。

發言人說：「這幾年來，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的實施讓香港重建安全穩定的環境，不僅保障了市民大眾的權利和自由，同時也讓香港成為更能吸引國際資金和投資的安全港。從資金持續流入、股市穩步上揚、海內外企業紛紛落戶香港、人才踴躍來港發展，以至香港在多項國際排名中名列前茅等，種種事實說明香港開放、安全、穩定、和高效的營商環境在國際間獲得廣泛認同，國際投資者和企業對香港的信心正進一步提升。」

事實上，本屆政府在招商引資、吸納人才方面，成績亮麗。例如，二○二四年，有香港境外母公司的駐港公司數目大幅增長約10%，總數接近10 000間，初創企業數目則接近4 700間，兩項數字均創歷年新高。引進重點企業辦公室成立兩年多，已引進84間重點企業來港開設或擴展業務，當中包括市值或估值過百億元，並擁有行內前沿技術的企業。而投資推廣署自二○二三年一月至二○二五年上半年，協助超過1 300間內地和海外企業在港開設或擴展業務，帶來超過1,600億元的投資。

人才方面，截至二○二五年六月，各項人才入境計劃共收到近50萬宗申請，當中近33萬宗獲批，近22萬人已經到港。

今年，香港金融市場的表現也穩步向上，繼去年恒生指數上升18%，今年至今上升超過25%，股市首半年每日成交額上升120%至約2,400億元。本月證券及期貨事務監察委員會公布的《2024年資產及財富管理活動調查》顯示本港資產管理業務進一步增長，截至去年底資產管理總值超過35萬億元，按年增加13%。

發言人說：「面對複雜多變的外圍環境，香港經濟結構正在升級轉型，但機遇大於挑戰。香港有國家作為強大後盾，政府、各界和市民共同努力，用好『一國兩制』的獨特優勢，把握國家發展機遇，大力發展科技創新和培育新質生產力，深化國際和區域交往合作，必定可以發展新的增長點，為香港開創新局面。」"

立法會十題：促進虛擬資產的發展,2025-07-30 16:08,2025-07-30 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000308.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上尚海龍議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

特區政府於二○二二年及本年先後發布兩份有關虛擬資產在港發展的政策宣言，明確將香港定位為全球領先的數字資產中心，並推動多項立法及監管措施，包括通過《穩定幣條例草案》及引入虛擬資產服務提供者發牌制度（發牌制度）。然而，有業界人士關注現行政策能否在保障投資者與促進創新之間取得平衡，以及香港如何應對國際競爭（例如美國及新加坡就穩定幣建立監管框架）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見認為在現行發牌制度下，僅有10間來自本地和海外的機構獲批牌照，證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）的審批速度較新加坡等競爭對手緩慢，當局有否制訂具體時間表以進一步簡化發牌程序，以吸引更多合規企業落戶香港；會否參考國際標準（例如歐盟的《加密資產市場監管法案》），制訂更具彈性的監管沙盒機制，鼓勵金融科技試驗；

（二）當局會否在未來三年將代幣化債券的發行常規化，並擴展至其他資產類別（例如房地產或私募基金）；政府會如何解決目前跨機構代幣化標準不統一的問題，例如會否與香港金融管理局、證監會及香港交易及結算所有限公司共同訂立協調機制；及

（三）會否與內地相關機構（例如中國人民銀行數字貨幣研究所）及國際組織（例如國際貨幣基金組織）加強合作，建立跨境虛擬資產監管及反洗錢協議？

答覆：

主席：

政府於二○二五年六月發表《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》（《政策宣言2.0》）。《政策宣言2.0》建基於二○二二年十月發表的首份政策宣言，重申政府致力將香港打造成數字資產領域中的全球創新中心。

《政策宣言2.0》其中一方面的重點是優化法律與監管。一套整全的監管框架為數字資產行業的可持續發展提供穩固基礎。繼數字資產交易平台發牌制度於二○二三年六月實施後，《穩定幣條例》將於今年八月一日生效。與此同時，政府與證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）正就數字資產交易服務提供者和數字資產託管服務提供者發牌制度諮詢公眾，以期盡快訂定立法建議。在有關立法工作完成後，香港的監管框架將全面涵蓋數字資產行業的主要節點，平衡風險管理和投資者保障，同時為市場發展和金融創新提供有利條件。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢香港金融管理局（金管局），證監會及香港警務處，我現答覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年七月初，證監會已正式發牌予11個來自本地和海外的數字資產交易平台，並正處理另外九個牌照申請。證監會處理數字資產交易平台牌照申請所需的時間受多項因素影響而有所不同，例如申請人所提供的資料是否完備；申請人提供的證明文件是否齊全；及在證監會的評核過程中，申請人就提供任何進一步資料而作出回應的所需時間等。

因應處理數字資產交易平台牌照申請的實際經驗，證監會不時檢視和優化相關程序，促進申請人更有效了解證監會的監管預期，以縮短證監會評估牌照申請所需的時間。就此，證監會於二○二四年六月起推行迅速發牌程序，對被當作獲發牌的數字資產交易平台申請者進行以風險為本的現場視察，與相關申請者的高層及最終控制人就監管標準作直接溝通，縮短了批出相關牌照所需的時間。

其後，證監會於二○二五年一月起，將迅速發牌程序的適用範圍擴展至所有數字資產交易平台牌照的新申請者。在迅速發牌程序下，數字資產交易平台申請者需要先落實內部的政策、程序、系統及監控措施，然後對有關措施進行外部評估。證監會將成為協定的參與方，以監督整個外部評估過程。證監會會持續檢視數字資產交易平台牌照的申請情況，以促進更多不同背景的數字資產交易平台營運者在香港展開相關業務。

另外，為了鼓勵金融創新，金管局、證監會和保險業監管局等監管機構設有不同監管沙盒機制，讓代幣化、區塊鏈，以至生成式人工智能及保險科技等金融科技在實際應用前，在風險可控的情況下測試創新用例，並獲取監管機構的技術支持及監管意見。監管機構設計沙盒時會參考海內外經驗，以締造健康及可持續的市場環境，協助金融機構抓緊機遇，負責任地採用金融科技。

（二）政府在二○二三年和二○二四年先後兩次以代幣化形式發行綠色債券，展示了代幣化方案的效益，並獲市場歡迎。該兩此債券發行分別是全球首批政府代幣化綠色債券及全球首批多幣種數碼原生代幣化債券。政府已在二○二五至二六年度的《財政預算案》中宣布將代幣化債券發行恒常化，而金管局目前正為第三次發行作準備。

正如《政策宣言2.0》所述，政府明白傳統金融產品及現實世界資產代幣化的潛力。政府亦留意到金融機構對於將傳統金融工具代幣化的興趣日趨濃厚，而探討將證券代幣化和向客戶分銷代幣化證券的中介人亦不斷增加。事實上，證監會於二○二三年十一月發出《有關中介人從事代幣化證券相關活動的通函》及《有關代幣化證監會認可投資產品的通函》，藉此向中介人提供指引，以妥善管理代幣化技術和相關投資產品所帶來的新風險，促進代幣化市場穩健、負責任及可持續發展。

建基於上述基礎，證監會在二○二四年已經認可了首項可供香港散戶買賣的代幣化投資產品，該黃金代幣允許投資者購買實金擁有權的一部分。證監會更在二○二五年第一季度認可了亞太區首批三隻容許散戶投資的代幣化貨幣市場基金，截至二○二五年三月底，這些基金的管理資產總值超過七億元。

與此同時，透過金管局的Ensemble項目，我們積極鼓勵創新應用場景，包括代幣化傳統金融產品（如貨幣市場基金及其他基金）以及現實世界資產（如電動車充電站）的收益流。而證監會亦為Ensemble項目的主要合作夥伴，與金管局共同促進資產管理行業相關代幣化的廣泛應用。金管局亦正探索建立創新的金融市場基礎設施，並提供統一的技術基礎，促進銀行間代幣化存款的結算。

（三）香港一直積極參與國際間有關打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的工作，包括與數字資產相關的標準制訂和監管工作。其中，香港的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集制度獲負責制訂相關國際標準的財務行動特別組織確認為整體合規而有效，而在國際合作方面取得的成效尤其顯著。

目前，香港正參與財務行動特別組織轄下的虛擬資產工作小組的討論，以了解相關最新的洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險，並促進國際間在有關方面的合作。金管局亦同時牽頭金融穩定理事會對加密資產活動全球監管框架在全球各地實施情況的檢討工作。

另外，香港警務處轄下的聯合財富情報組是國際金融情報組織埃格蒙特組織的成員，與組織當中超過160個來自世界各地的財富情報單位交換資訊，合力支援跨司法管轄區的執法和交換情報工作，促進國際間有關打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集（包括涉及數字資產的案件）的執法工作。

與此同時，內地、香港特別行政區與澳門特別行政區三地與反洗錢相關的部門已建立機制，就有關工作定期交流與保持緊密協作。

財經事務及庫務局、金融監管機構和執法機構會繼續密切留意有關洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集和數字資產的風險，持續與相關的國際組織和其他司法管轄區（包括內地）的相關機構保持緊密溝通與合作。

香港亦一直就數字資產監管及發展與各地監管機構保持密切溝通。隨着全球主要地區逐步推動與數字資產相關的監管制度，香港將繼續與國際社會互相交流監管經驗，強化跨境監管合作，共同促進金融穩定和創新。"
LCQ10: Promoting virtual asset development,2025-07-30 16:08,2025-07-30 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000312.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Shang Hailong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 In 2022 and this year, the SAR Government promulgated two policy statements on the development of virtual assets (VA) in Hong Kong respectively, explicitly positioning the city as a premier global hub for digital assets and taking forward various legislative and regulatory measures. These include the passage of the Stablecoins Bill and the introduction of a licensing regime for VA service providers (the licensing regime). However, some industry participants have expressed concerns about whether the existing policies can strike an appropriate balance between investor protection and innovation promotion, and how Hong Kong will address international competition (such as the regulatory frameworks for stablecoins established by the United States and Singapore). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views that under the existing licensing regime, only 10 institutions from both local and overseas markets have been granted licences, and that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)'s approval speed lags behind that of competitors such as Singapore, whether the authorities have drawn up a specific timetable to further streamline the licensing process, in order to attract more compliant enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong; whether it will draw reference from international standards (such as the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) to develop a more flexible regulatory sandbox mechanism that encourage trials of financial technology;

(2) whether the authorities will, within the next three years, regularise the issuance of tokenised bonds and extend this to other asset classes (such as real estate or private equity funds); how the Government will resolve the current lack of uniformity in cross-institutional tokenisation standards, for example, whether it will establish a co-ordination mechanism jointly with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, SFC and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited; and

(3) whether it will strengthen co-operation with relevant Mainland institutions (such as the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China) and international organisations (such as the International Monetary Fund), in order to establish cross-boundary agreements on VA regulation and anti-money laundering initiatives?

Reply:

President,

 The Government issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong (Policy Statement 2.0) in June 2025. Building on the first policy statement released in October 2022, Policy Statement 2.0 reaffirms the Government's commitment to positioning Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in the digital asset field.

 One of the key focuses of Policy Statement 2.0 is enhancing the legal and regulatory framework. A comprehensive regulatory framework provides a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the digital asset sector. Following the implementation of the licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms in June 2023, the Stablecoins Ordinance will come into effect on August 1 this year. At the same time, the Government and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) are consulting the public on the licensing regimes for digital asset dealing service and custodian service providers, with a view to formulating the legislative proposals as soon as practicable. Upon the completion of the legislative work, the regulatory framework in Hong Kong will provide comprehensive coverage of the key nodes of the digital asset industry, balancing risk management and investor protection, while providing favourable conditions for market development and financial innovation.

 After consulting the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the SFC, and the Hong Kong Police Force, our reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) As of early July 2025, the SFC has officially granted licences to 11 digital asset trading platforms with both local and overseas background, and is processing an additional nine licence applications. The time required to process licence applications regarding digital asset trading platform varies, depending on various factors such as the completeness of the information provided by the applicants, the adequacy of the supporting documents submitted by the applicants, and the time taken by the applicants to respond to requests for further information during the SFC's assessment process.

 Based on the practical experience in processing licence applications, the SFC from time to time reviews and enhances relevant procedures to help applicants better understand the SFC's regulatory expectations, thereby reducing the time required for licence assessments. In this regard, the SFC launched a swift licensing process in June 2024, under risk-based on-site inspections would be conducted on those deemed-to-be-licensed digital asset trading platform applicants. During the process, the SFC would communicate direct with the senior management and ultimate controllers of the relevant applicants about regulatory standards, so as to reduce the time required for granting relevant licences.

 Subsequently, the SFC expanded in January 2025 the scope of the swift licensing process to include all new applicants for a digital asset trading platform licence. Under the swift licensing process, applicants are required to first establish internal policies, procedures, systems and monitoring measures, which must then undergo external assessment. The SFC acts as one of the parties overseeing the entire external assessment process. The SFC continues to review the circumstances in respect of applications for a digital asset trading platform licence, with a view to facilitating more digital asset trading platform operators from diverse backgrounds to commence business in Hong Kong.

 In addition, to promote financial innovation, regulatory authorities such as the HKMA, the SFC, and the Insurance Authority have established various regulatory sandbox mechanisms. These enable innovative use cases in tokenisation, blockchain, generative AI (artificial intelligence) and insurance technology to be tested under a risk-controlled environment before their actual application, while receiving technical support and regulatory feedback from the regulatory authorities. The design of these sandboxes has taken reference to both local and overseas experience to foster a healthy and sustainable environment for the market, helping financial institutions seize opportunities and responsibly adopt financial technologies.

(2) The Government made two issuances of tokenised green bonds in 2023 and 2024, which demonstrated the benefits of tokenisation and were well received by the market. The two issuances represented the first tokenised green bond issued by a government and the first multi-currency digitally native tokenised bonds in the world respectively. In the 2025-26 Budget, the Government announced the regularisation of tokenised bond issuance, and the HKMA is currently preparing for the third issuance.

 As highlighted in Policy Statement 2.0, the Government recognises the potential of tokenisation of traditional financial products and real-world assets. The Government has also observed growing interest among financial institutions in tokenising traditional financial instruments, and that more and more intermediaries are exploring tokenisation of securities and distributing tokenised securities. In fact, the SFC issued ""Circular on intermediaries engaging in tokenised securities-related activities"" and ""Circular on tokenisation of SFC-authorised investment products"" in November 2023, providing guidance to intermediaries on managing new risks posed by tokenisation technology and related investment products, thereby promoting the steady, responsible and sustainable development of the tokenisation market.

 Building on the above, the SFC authorised in 2024 the first tokenised investment product for retail access in Hong Kong. That is a gold token that allows investors to acquire fractional ownership of physical gold. In the first quarter of 2025, the SFC further authorised three retail tokenised money market funds, which were the first in the Asia Pacific region. As of the end of March 2025, these funds had a total of over $700 million assets under management.

 Meanwhile, through the HKMA's Project Ensemble, we are actively encouraging innovative use cases, including the tokenisation of traditional financial products (e.g. money market funds and other funds) and revenue streams of real-world assets (e.g. electric vehicle charging stations). The SFC is a key partner of Project Ensemble, and has been working with the HKMA to promote the wider adoption of tokenisation in the asset management industry. The HKMA is also exploring the development of innovative financial market infrastructure, providing a unified technical foundation to facilitate interbank settlement of tokenised deposits.

(3) Hong Kong has been actively participating in international efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including the development of standards and regulations relating to digital assets. In particular, Hong Kong's regime for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the setter of relevant international standards, as both overall compliant and effective, especially in international co-operation.

 Currently, Hong Kong is participating in the discussion of the Virtual Assets Contact Group under the FATF, so as to keep abreast of the latest related risks in respect of money laundering and terrorist financing and to foster international collaboration in this area. Meanwhile, the HKMA is leading the Financial Stability Board's review of the global implementation of the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities.

 In addition, the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit under the Hong Kong Police Force is a member of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, exchanging information with over 160 member financial intelligence units worldwide. This supports cross-jurisdiction enforcement and intelligence-sharing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including cases involving digital assets.

 At the same time, the anti-money laundering related agencies in the Mainland, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macao Special Administrative Region have established mechanisms for regular exchanges and close collaboration.

 The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, financial regulators and law enforcement agencies will continue to monitor the risks associated with money laundering, terrorist financing and digital assets. We will maintain close communication and collaboration with relevant international organisations and relevant agencies in other jurisdictions, including the Mainland.

 Hong Kong has also maintained close communication with regulators around the world on the regulation and developments of digital assets. As major regions around the world gradually implement regulatory regimes related to digital assets, Hong Kong will continue to exchange regulatory experience with the international community, strengthen cross-border/cross-boundary regulatory collaboration, and jointly promote financial stability and innovation."
LCQ5: Establishment of smart education platform and large language models,2025-07-30 16:03,2025-07-30 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000556.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon William Wong and a reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

  It has been reported that the Mainland has set up a national smart education public service platform (""smart education platform"") covering primary and secondary education, vocational education, higher education and lifelong learning to provide personalised online interactive learning materials along with round-the-clock support for students and continuing education participants. Some members of the community have suggested that the Government should prioritise the establishment of large language models (LLMs) and an education platform applicable in Hong Kong's education system and incorporate therein correct history, culture and values so as to elevate the quality of education and the depth of cultural inheritance in the territory. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the total numbers of educational institutions in Hong Kong (including universities, secondary and primary schools, and vocational education institutions) which have currently established on-premises LLMs for subject-based education;

(2) whether it has plans to develop LLMs of subject-based education with local characteristics for use by students and people pursuing further studies in Hong Kong; if so, when the development will begin; if not, whether it will consider establishing such models; and

(3) given that the Mainland has already established a smart education platform, whether the Government will consider discussing with relevant Mainland authorities the possibility of replicating the platform in Hong Kong and adapting them for use by local educational institutions at various levels, following integration with the local curriculum?

Reply:

President,

  As global digitalisation continues to progress, the Education Bureau (EDB), in line with the national strategy for invigorating the country through science and education, actively promotes education innovation and takes forward digital education in order to nurture future talents to embrace the challenges and opportunities in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the formation of the Steering Committee on Strategic Development of Digital Education, we have identified the directions and key focus areas for digital education, and are continuously optimising the curricula, strengthening relevant training for teachers, improving digital education infrastructure, enhancing learning platforms and AI technology as well as collaborating with stakeholders from various sectors, with a view to promoting the implementation of digital education and enhancing the quality of local education.

  Our consolidated reply to the question raised by Professor the Hon William Wong is as follows:

  With training in the form of deep learning of massive amounts of text data, large language models (LLMs) are able to generate natural language text and handle various natural language tasks such as text summarisation, questioning and answering, and translation. In the field of education, the application of LLMs serves as a learning and teaching aid which assists teachers in preparing lessons, setting questions and marking assignments on one hand, and help students search for information, obtain writing advice, etc on the other hand. At present, the application of LLMs in teaching is being developed and improved continuously. To effectively enhance the quality of education and the depth of cultural heritage, including incorporating proper values with respect to history and culture through the application of LLMs, it is essential for teachers to apply technology in a professional manner and make reference to resources from local, national and international online platforms, so as to flexibly adopt teaching strategies and design quality learning activities which align with the curriculum and meet the needs of students.

  In this connection, the EDB has been encouraging and supporting schools to explore and adopt diversified and appropriate teaching strategies based on their school contexts and students' learning needs, and to make good use of technology including LLMs. At the same time, schools are encouraged to nurture students' information literacy as well as proper attitudes and values towards the application of innovation and technology (I&T) which align with the aims and objectives of the school curriculum. Currently, some schools in Hong Kong are trying to develop school-based LLMs for application in learning and teaching. While the EDB supports school-based innovation, we do not require all schools to develop their own LLMs for subject-based teaching at the present stage. As such, relevant statistics are not available. To keep abreast of the times, we will closely take heed of the trends in technological development and application, strengthen the professional development of teachers, and review the application of LLMs in a timely manner.

  To promote digital transformation in education, we have allocated $500million under the Quality Education Fund for the implementation of the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme to develop e-learning ancillary facilities that meet local learning and teaching needs. There are a total of 22 funded projects in which I&T such as LLMs are deployed. The deliverables of the projects are to be released in four batches starting from mid-2025 for the use of publicly-funded schools. In fact, schools may utilise different resources such as the Composite Information Technology Grant in a flexible manner according to their school contexts for procuring different digital teaching tools and platforms to tie in with subject teaching and cater for the diverse learning needs of students in learning.

  On resources development, the EDB has been committed to providing schools with quality teaching materials, including learning and teaching resources on different subjects, the Educational MultiMedia and the EDB One-stop Portal for Learning and Teaching Resources, covering the Key Learning Areas and cross-disciplinary subjects or areas at kindergarten, primary and secondary levels. The EDB has also been collaborating with the Hong Kong Education City Limited (HKEdCity) to provide one-stop services on e-learning, e-reading and e-assessment including platforms such as the eRead Scheme and the Student Assessment Repository to meet the needs of local schools, and with the provision of the online learning platform and related courses on AI and computational thinking for students, the aim of sharing resources is achieved.

  Regarding the smart education platform developed by our country, local teachers and students at present can browse around for free without the need to register. However, as the curricula of the two places vary, Hong Kong schools need to make adaptations and relevant technical adjustments when using the platform. The EDB has already liaised with relevant authorities to gain insights into the mode of operation and types of resources provided by the platform. We will also actively study and make reference to the relevant experience of the platform, so as to explore feasible options for the enhancement of local teaching and learning resource platforms to better support learning and teaching. We will continue to strengthen professional teacher training on I&T and AI, optimise the platform of the HKEdCity, make reference to and utilise existing high-quality learning and teaching platforms, LLMs and programmes locally and from our country and overseas, encourage cross-sectoral and cross-school sharing of resources, and explore cost-effective approaches to further support the learning and teaching of digital education in Hong Kong.

  For post-secondary education, with the advent of AI, innovative and breakthrough technology in the new era, post-secondary institutions are encouraged to actively explore and experiment in teaching and learning. Amongst others, the University Grants Committee (UGC) launched the $100 million Fund for Innovative Technology-in-Education in 2023 to provide an impetus for universities to harness innovative and breakthrough technologies in transforming pedagogies and enriching student learning experiences. The eight UGC-funded universities are capitalising on the funding to continuously implement around 100 new projects, with the aim to drive transformation in pedagogies, curricula, assessments, and student development; advance digital competency comprehensively; promote technological social responsibilities and academic integrity; and foster academia-industry collaboration and enhance authentic learning experience. The goal is to nurture university students into a digitally competent and technologically responsible new generation under the digital economy. These projects are underway and expected to be completed in 2026.

  In addition, through targeted support measures, including the Enhancement and Start-up Grant Scheme for Self-financing Post-secondary Education, as well as the Quality Enhancement Support Scheme, we support universities of applied sciences and self-financing post-secondary education institutions to enhance teaching quality by seizing the opportunities arising from technological advancement and make good use of AI.

  In response to the rapid development of AI technologies, the Vocational Training Council (VTC) has also established the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology (HKIIT), which admitted its first cohort of students in the 2024/25 academic year (AY). The VTC is developing AI-enabled interactive learning materials, including introducing educational chatbots to provide students with instant learning feedback to enhance their learning outcomes. The EDB has been supporting post-secondary institutions to introduce appropriate teaching frameworks and new programmes, so as to enhance support for academic staff and students, and meet ever-changing societal needs. In the 2024/25 AY, there are about 10programmes related to AI offered by the UGC-funded universities. A number of UGC-funded universities have also offered AI-related undergraduate programmes in the 2025-28 triennium in response to the strategic directions set by the Government, for example, ""Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence"" of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and ""Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science"" of the University of Hong Kong.

  As regards the self-financing post-secondary sector, institutions have the flexibility to develop programmes that meet market demands and adjust the curricula and intake places of relevant programmes, in response to the ever-changing manpower needs of society. In the 2024/25 AY, there are a total of 15 post-secondary programmes relating to AI by 10 self-financing institutions. The HKIIT of the VTC also offers a total of 21 programmes in the 2024/25 AY, covering areas including cybersecurity, AI, and software engineering.

  In sum, the EDB will continue to encourage schools to use I&T and keep a close watch on the application and development of I&T in this field, strengthen the exchange and collaboration with partners in the Mainland and overseas to facilitate the high-quality development of digitisation of local education.

  Thank you, President."
立法會五題︰建立智慧教育平台及大語言模型,2025-07-30 16:02,2025-07-30 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000551.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上黃錦輝議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的答覆︰

問題：

據報內地已建立涵蓋中小學、職業教育、高等教育和終身學習的「國家智慧教育公共服務平台」（智慧教育平台），為學生和持續進修人士提供個人化、全天候支援的線上互動學習教材。有社會人士建議，政府應優先建立適用於香港教育體系的大語言模型及教育平台，並融入正確的歷史、文化與價值觀，藉此提升本地教育質素及文化傳承的深度。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，目前全港共有多少間學校（包括大、中及小學，以及職業教育學校）已在校內建立分科教育的大語言模型；

（二）有否計劃開發供香港學生和進修人士使用，並具本地特色的分科教育大語言模型；如有，何時開始推展；如否，會否考慮建立有關模型；及

（三）鑑於內地已設立智慧教育平台，政府會否考慮與內地相關部門商討，將該平台移植至香港，並在融合本地課程後，供本地各級學校使用？

答覆：

主席：

在全球數字化持續推進，配合國家科教興國戰略，教育局積極推動教育創新，開展數字教育，培育未來人才，迎接人工智能時代的挑戰和機遇。我們通過成立的「數字教育策略發展督導委員會」，訂定數字教育的方向和重點，持續優化課程、加強教師培訓、完善數字教育基礎建設，優化學習平台和人工智能技術等，與各界不同持份者協作，推動數字教育的實踐，提升本地教育質素。

就黃錦輝議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

大語言模型通過海量文本數據訓練的深度學習，能夠生成自然語言文本，處理各種自然語言任務，如文本摘要、問答、翻譯等。應用於教育領域，可以輔助教師備課、出題和批改作業，協助學生查索資料、獲得寫作建議等，是輔助教學工具之一。目前，大語言模型於教學上的應用正在不斷發展和完善，要藉以提升教育質素及文化傳承的深度，包括融入正確的歷史、文化價值觀等，有賴教師專業地應用科技，參考本地、國家及其他地方網上平台的資源，配合課程及對應學生需要，靈活運用教學策略，設計優質的學習活動，方能發揮作用。

為此，教育局一直鼓勵及支持學校，因應校情及學生學習需要，探索和採用多元化適切的教學策略，善用科技，包括大語言模型等，同時，配合學校課程的宗旨和目標，培養學生的資訊素養，使用創新科技的正確態度和價值觀。現時，本港部分學校正嘗試建立校本大語言模型，並應用於學與教上。教育局支持校本創新，但現階段並沒有要求所有學校自行建立與分科教學相關的大語言模型，因此，亦未有相關統計數字。我們會密切留意科技發展及應用的趨勢，做好教師專業發展，適時檢視大語言模型的應用，與時並進。

為推動教育數字化轉型，我們透過優質教育基金（基金）撥款五億，推行「電子學習配套計劃」，發展切合本地教學需要的電子學習配套。二十二個獲基金資助的項目，均採用了創新科技，當中包括大語言模型。項目的成果自二○二五年年中開始，分四批發布，供公帑資助學校使用。事實上，學校可因應校情，靈活運用不同資源，如「資訊科技綜合津貼」等，採購不同數字教學工具與平台，配合學科教學和照顧學生多元學習需要。

在資源開發方面，教育局一直致力為學校提供優質的教材，包括不同科目的學與教資源、「教育多媒體」和「教育局一站式學與教資源平台」，涵蓋幼稚園、小學和中學各學習領域及跨學科科目或範疇；又與香港教育城有限公司（教城）合作，提供切合本地學校需要的一站式電子學習、閱讀及評估服務，包括通過「e悅讀學校計劃」、「學生評估資源庫（STAR）」等平台，配合為學生提供的人工智能和運算思維的網上學習平台和有關課程，達至資源共享的目的。

至於國家開發的智慧教育平台，現時本港師生無需登記，可以免費瀏覽；然而，兩地課程不同，本港學校使用上述平台，需進行調適及作相關技術調整。目前，教育局已與智慧教育平台相關部門連繫，了解平台的運作模式與資源類型，並將積極研究及借鑑相關平台的經驗，探討可行方案，優化本地的教學資源平台，更好支援學與教。我們會繼續加強創科及人工智能教育的教師專業培訓，優化教城平台，參考及善用本地、國家及海外的優質學與教平台、大語言模型及程式等，鼓勵跨界別及跨校資源共享，探討具成本效益的模式，進一步支援本港數字教育的學與教。

在專上教育方面，隨着人工智能、創新和突破性科技的湧現，我們鼓勵專上院校在教與學上積極探索及嘗試。其中，大學教育資助委員會（教資會）於二○二三年撥款一億元，設立科教創新基金，鼓勵大學利用創新及突破性科技推進教學革新及豐富學習體驗。八所教資會資助大學正利用撥款，持續推行約100個新項目，達致推動教學法、課程、評估和學生發展的轉型；全面提升數碼素養；推廣科技社會責任和學術誠信；以及促進學術界與產業協作，增強真實學習體驗，務求培養大學生在數字化經濟環境中成為德才兼備的新世代人才等目標。目前，各項目正進行當中，預計將於二○二六年完成。

另外，我們通過針對性的支援措施，包括自資專上教育提升及啟動補助金計劃及質素提升支援計劃等，支持應用科學大學、自資專上院校把握科技發展的機遇，善用人工智能等，提升教學質素。

因應人工智能技術的快速發展，職業訓練局（職訓局）亦成立了香港資訊科技學院，於二○二四／二五學年錄取首屆學生。現時，職訓局正發展人工智能互動學習教材，包括引入教育聊天機械人，為學生提供即時學習回饋，協助他們提升學習成效。教育局一直支持院校推行適切的教學框架及新課程，加強對教學人員及學生的支持，以回應時代轉變，滿足社會需求。在二○二四／二五學年，教資會資助大學已開設約10個與人工智能相關的課程。在二○二五至二八三年期，多所教資會資助大學因應政府的策略方針，推出與人工智能相關的學士學位課程，例如：香港科技大學的「工學士（人工智能）」；香港大學的「文學士及工學學士（人工智能及數據科學）」。

至於自資專上界別，各院校可靈活開辦符合市場需要的課程，調整相關課程的內容及學額，回應社會不斷轉變的人力需求。在二○二四／二五學年，有10所自資院校開辦共15個與人工智能相關的專上課程。職業訓練局的香港資訊科技學院亦已於二○二四／二五學年開辦共21個課程，涵蓋網絡安全、人工智能、軟件工程等領域。

總而言之，教育局會繼續鼓勵學校運用創新科技，亦會密切留意這科技領域的應用與發展，加強與海內外夥伴交流合作，支持本地教育數字化的高質量發展。

多謝主席。"

立法會：署理勞工及福利局局長就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 15:56,2025-07-30 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000573.htm,"以下是署理勞工及福利局局長何啟明今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議就「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」議員議案的開場發言全文：

主席：

我感謝顏汶羽議員提出「完善灣區人才標準，促進區域人才流動」這項議案，並感謝梁子穎議員提出的修正案，讓我們可以就這個議題發表及交流意見。特區政府會仔細聆聽議員的建議。

人才是推動發展的第一資源。特區政府一直以培育本地人才為主，引入外來人才為輔，藉豐富本地人才庫滿足社會經濟發展所需。為應對殷切的人力需求，以對接國家發展新質生產力等重要戰略方向，吸引國際高端人才集聚香港，特區政府一直積極採取多管齊下的策略，在豐富本地人才庫的同時，亦致力深化香港與其他粵港澳大灣區城市人才服務工作的交流和合作，共同推動人才引進、培養和交流，促進多元人才在灣區流動，加快建設大灣區高水平人才高地。

在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA）的框架下，內地已在絕大部分的服務貿易領域對香港實施優惠和便利措施，包括放寬香港專業人士提供服務的資質要求、准許香港專業人士在內地參加考試、註冊、執業和開業，以及鼓勵雙方的專業機構進行資格互認。特區政府各政策局及部門一直與內地相關部委和廣東省政府緊密合作，並與各行業組織充分溝通，在多個專業領域，就相關行業致力推動香港與其他大灣區城市的專業人才發展、便捷兩地專業人才資格互認及強化相關標準銜接的工作，為兩地專業人員開拓更廣闊的發展空間。我想藉此機會，簡單介紹相關工作的幾個重點範疇。

在建築及相關工程服務方面，香港的專業學會和內地有關規管機構已就六個專業的職業資格簽署了互認協議。在粵港政府的共同努力下，適用於香港專業人才的職稱評價機制已於二○二三年成功制訂。試點職稱評價開創香港專業人士獲取內地職稱的創新機制，是兩地專業資格領域規則銜接的重大突破。融入內地職稱評價系統，有助香港專業人才的技術水平和資歷在內地市場獲得認可。

在金融服務領域方面，政府致力為兩地業界建立人才互通的橋樑。在CEPA框架下，內地與香港已就不同金融服務業的專業及行業資格推出開放措施，有利於內地金融人才來港發展。舉例來說，內地的證券、基金或期貨專業人員可獲證券及期貨事務監察委員會視作符合香港的牌照資格要求；而在銀行業，兩地從業人員亦可在資格互認機制下考取「雙資格」，提升專業競爭力。

法律服務方面，在CEPA《服務貿易協議》新增的大灣區內地城市先行先試的開放措施下，符合條件的香港律師和大律師在通過粵港澳大灣區律師執業考試並取得律師執業證（粵港澳大灣區）後，可以在大灣區內地九市辦理適用內地法律的部分民商事法律事務。爭議解決服務方面，政府亦與粵澳法律部門合作，發布了粵港澳大灣區調解員名冊，為整合大灣區調解人才奠定基礎。

除了上述領域，各政策局及部門均在各自範疇積極推展工作，促進其他專業人才在灣區流動，例如醫務及護理服務方面，在CEPA框架下，已有12類香港註冊醫療衞生專業人員可到內地短期執業。在資歷框架合作上，香港學術及職業資歷評審局亦協助及支援廣東省建立其終身教育資歷框架，長遠為粵港兩地資歷架構／框架的進一步交流和合作建立基礎，便利兩地在人才培訓方面的探索。

剛才介紹的，只是特區政府相關工作的一部分。政府的目標是要發揮香港「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，擔當國際人才樞紐和國家人才門戶的雙重角色，發揮「引進來、走出去」的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色，加強人才資格互認及標準銜接的工作，促進灣區人才流動，加快發展新質生產力，推動高質量發展。

主席，我會仔細聆聽議員的發言，並在總結時再就議員的意見作出回應。

多謝主席。"

LCQ21: Enhancing public rental housing management,2025-07-30 15:30,2025-07-30 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000341.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Dominic Lee and a written reply by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, who is undertaking the duties of the Secretary for Housing, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing,in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

  There are views that, in recent years, residents of public rental housing (PRH) have had differing opinions regarding the management services provided by the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA), however, the existing channels established by HA for collecting residents' opinions are not sufficiently comprehensive. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective total number of opinions submitted by PRH residents to HA through telephone hotlines, Estate Management Advisory Committees, mail, and other channels in each of the past five years, with a breakdown by the nature of the opinions submitted (e.g. PRH maintenance, environmental hygiene, and community facilities);

(2) whether the authorities have assessed the effectiveness of the existing opinion collection mechanism (e.g. the average time taken by HA to reply to opinions, the resolution rate of issues raised, and residents' satisfaction); if such an assessment has been conducted, of the specific indicators and results; if not, whether consideration will be given to establishing such an assessment mechanism;

(3) given that some elderly persons and persons with disabilities have reflected that the feedback channels established by HA are inadequate, whether HA will introduce feedback facilitation measures for specific individuals (e.g. door-to-door collection of opinions, simplified opinion collection forms, and the provision of voice input systems); if so, of the implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether the authorities have plans to develop an electronic platform to integrate opinion data related to PRH management across various districts, and to utilise artificial intelligence to analyse and identify issues of greatest public concern, as well as to predict potential problems in PRH management; if so, of the details and the estimated implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that and the difficulties involved;

(5) whether it will, with reference to standards in private property management, require HA to regularly publish consolidated analysis reports on the opinions of PRH residents across the territory regarding PRH management, which should include trends in their primary demands and the follow-up improvement measures adopted by HA in response to such opinions; and

(6) whether it will consider organising regular engagement sessions to exchange views on housing estate management with local stakeholders (including District Council members, Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, District Fire Safety Committees, District Services and Community Care Teams, owners' corporations and residents' representatives)?

Reply:

President,

  Always upholding the values of ""Caring"", the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has been committed to providing quality public rental housing (PRH) to residents. Through professional management and maintenance, we strive to create a good living environment for residents in an attentive and responsible manner. Residents of public housing are our major service targets. We attach great importance to their expectations and needs. We will continue to maintain contact with residents and local stakeholders, to collect their opinions through various channels, and to listen to their views on how to enhance the living quality of residents in public housing with a view to enhancing their sense of well-being.

  In response to the question raised by the Hon Dominic Lee, in consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the Home Affairs Department, our reply is as follows:

(1) The numbers of complaints and requests regarding estate management issues of PRH received by the HA from 2020 to 2024 are set out by year at Annex.

(2) to (6) The HA/Housing Department (HD) has been actively widening its communication channels with residents, and collecting opinions from PRH residents through both traditional and electronic means so as to enhance estate management services. The HD has placed suggestion boxes at the ground floor lobbies of domestic blocks in all estates. Apart from providing paper questionnaire surveys, the HD also printed QR code and hyperlinks to the electronic questionnaire survey on the notice for opinion collection to facilitate PRH residents to complete electronic questionnaires. Summaries of residents' opinions collected through electronic questionnaires will be distributed to residents through the Estate Newsletter published in May and November every year, so that they are informed of the concerns of other residents about the management issues in their respective estates.

  Furthermore, the HA/HD regularly conducts Tenants' Opinion Surveys to collect residents' feedback on the performance of various estate service contractors (including estate property service agents, works contractors, cleaning and security service contractors). Residents can choose to complete paper questionnaires and opinion forms, answer electronic questionnaires, have telephone interviews or face-to-face interviews to express their opinions. Residents are also welcome to exchange views with the HD's staff by making telephone calls or visiting estate management offices in person any time, or directly talk to estate staff during home visits to reflect their opinions.

  Additionally, the HD conducts the Public Housing Recurrent Survey (PHRS) biennially to collect views from households currently living in the HA's PRH estates on housing-related matters. The matters include estate management, maintenance services for estate common areas and households' premises, marking scheme for estate management enforcement, environmental facilities and initiatives in estates, as well as HA's shopping facilities and parking arrangement in estates. The survey covers all PRH estates in Hong Kong, with PRH households selected for participation in interviews through random sampling to collect the views of PRH residents on the abovementioned matters. The survey results are announced at the HA's Subsidised Housing Committee meetings and are made available for public's review. The major findings of the latest PHRS can be downloaded from the HD's website (www.housingauthority.gov.hk/en/common/pdf/about-us/housing-authority/ha-paper-library/SHC6-20241EN.pdf).

  To further promote the application of innovative technologies in PRH estate management, the HA will launch a centralised property management platform this year. By leveraging data analysis and integrating digital technology into daily management operations, the platform aims to enhance management efficiency and improve service quality. The HA has also established a dedicated co-ordination team to oversee the trial of various innovative technologies across different management areas and review operational models, including updating workflows and manuals as well as providing appropriate training to staff. We will closely monitor relevant technological developments and introduce more innovative technologies as appropriate to optimise estate management works.

  When implementing improvement works projects in existing estates, the HA places great emphasis on the views and participation of residents. To ensure that the works projects can truly meet the needs of the residents, the HD adopts various means for public consultation to extensively collect suggestions from residents and stakeholders on the improvement works projects. This helps the project team formulate detailed design proposals more effectively.

  The improvement works project at Chak On Estate in Sham Shui Po is one of the innovative attempts. The HA held the ""Let's Go Well-being Chak On"" Design Competition from January to May 2025 and invited the public to provide design proposals for the improvement works in the estate. The competition successfully attracted over 150 outstanding young designers and students to participate. They interpreted the concept of ""Well-being Design"" Guide through innovative and thoughtful designs, injecting new vitality into the communal spaces of Chak On Estate. All shortlisted teams engaged Chak On Estate residents in the co-creation processes and collected their views on the designs. Not only did the winning entries showcase the professionalism and creativity of the contestants, but they also reflected contestants' careful attention to and understanding of the residents' needs. This allowed residents to participate in the improvement works project of the estate in a novel way and enhanced their sense of belonging and pride.

  The HA has been actively promoting a caring and inclusive community and collaborates with non-governmental organisations and other government departments to organise various kinds of community building activities, strengthen mutual support among residents, and enhance community cohesion. To further deepen exchanges with local stakeholders, the HD has been organising regional estate management sharing sessions since the second quarter of this year. Local stakeholders including relevant District Council members were invited to participate in the sessions to exchange views and share their estate management experience. The HD staff also briefed the participants on the latest policies of the HA and related information, and directly listened to their suggestions and opinions on estate management.

  To further strengthen the attention and support for the elderly and the disabled, as well as to listen to their opinions, the PRH estate offices under the HA proactively assist the District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams) in promoting care activities, organising community events, and offering visits and support services for families in need (including elderly households, disabled individual, and carer households). Additionally, the HA partners with non-governmental organisations to host activities such as outreach visits every year. The LWB and the HD have strengthened their collaboration by integrating data from the Social Welfare Department's elderly service users with the HD's PRH residents' data so as to identify high-risk hidden households. In mid-July 2025, a pilot scheme was launched in Kwun Tong District and Sha Tin District, inviting the Care Teams to proactively contact and visit these elderly, disabled individual and carer households to understand their needs and introduce relevant support services, etc. This scheme enables them to strengthen their support networks, to seek assistance in emergencies or when needed, and to be heard of their views on other services and estate management.

  The HA will continuously strive to optimise the communication mechanism and measures with PRH residents, provide diverse and convenient communication channels, so as to enhance public housing management standards, build a harmonious community and strengthen the sense of well-being and belonging of PRH residents."

  From noon on July 29 to noon today (July 30), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 204 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 154 635 samples of food imported from Japan (including 101 387 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 35 096 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

問題：

有意見認為近年公共租住房屋公屋（公屋）居民對香港房屋委員會（房委會）提供的管理服務有不同意見，惟現行房委會的意見收集渠道卻未夠全面。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年公屋居民透過電話熱線、屋邨管理諮詢委員會及郵寄等途徑向房委會提交的意見總數分別為何，並按意見性質（例如公屋維修、環境衞生和社區設施等）列出分項數字；

（六）會否考慮定期組織交流會，與地區持份者（包括區議員、分區委員會、地區撲滅罪行委員會及地區防火委員會、地區服務及關愛隊伍、業主立案法團及居民代表等）交流屋苑的管理意見？

答覆：

主席：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）一直本着「關懷為本」的信念，致力為居民提供優質公共租住房屋（公屋），透過專業管理及維修保養，秉持為民盡責的基本信念，為居民締造良好的居住環境。公營房屋的居民是我們重要的服務對象，我們非常重視居民的期望及需要，我們會持續與居民及地區持份者保持聯繫，並會透過不同渠道收集居民的意見，聆聽居民及地區持份者就改善公營房屋居民生活質素方面的意見，以提升居民的幸福感。

就李梓敬議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局和民政事務總署，現回覆如下：

（一）房委會二○二○年至二○二四年接獲有關公屋管理事宜的投訴及尋求協助個案，按年載列於附件。

（二）至（六）房委會／房屋署一直積極擴闊與居民的溝通渠道，透過不同傳統和電子方式收集租戶的意見，以優化屋邨管理的服務。房屋署已在各屋邨大廈地下大堂設置意見箱，除提供意見調查的紙本問卷，亦在收集意見通告上印有二維碼和超連結，方便公屋住戶填寫電子問卷。經電子問卷收集的意見摘要，會透過每年五月和十一月出版的《屋邨通訊》向住戶發放，讓他們知悉其所屬屋邨的居民的關注事宜。

此外，房委會亦定期進行住戶意見調查收集居民對屋邨各服務承辦商（包括屋邨的物業服務公司、工程承辦商、潔淨及護衞服務承辦商）服務表現的意見。住戶可選擇填寫紙本問卷及意見書、回答電子問卷、進行電話會談或上門面談等方式表達意見。住戶亦可隨時致電或親臨各屋邨辦事處，或於職員進行家訪時與屋邨職員直接反映意見。

另外，房屋署每兩年會進行一次公營房屋住戶綜合統計調查，以蒐集現居於房委會轄下公屋住戶對房屋相關事宜的意見，當中包括屋邨管理、公用地方和住戶單位維修保養服務、屋邨管理扣分制、屋邨環保設施及工作，以及房委會商場設施和屋邨停車位安排。該統計調查涵蓋全港所有公共屋邨，以隨機抽樣方式抽選公屋單位住戶接受訪問，以收集公屋居民就上述事宜的意見。上述的調查結果會在房委會資助房屋小組委員會議公布，並讓公眾人士查閱。最新「公營房屋住戶統計調查」的主要結果可於房屋署網站下載（www.housingauthority.gov.hk/tc/common/pdf/about-us/housing-authority/ha-paper-library/SHC6-2024TC.pdf）。

為進一步推展創新科技在公共屋邨管理方面的應用，房委會會於今年內推出中央物業管理平台，透過數據分析及在日常管理引入數字科技，更有效地處理屋邨管理工作，提升服務水平。房委會亦已成立統籌專隊，協調各組別在屋邨管理的不同工作範疇試行各項創新科技及檢討管理模式，包括更新工作流程及工作手冊和向工作人員提供合適的訓練。我們會密切留意相關的技術發展，適時引進更多創新科技，以優化屋邨管理的工作。

在現有屋邨推行改善工程時，房委會非常重視居民的意見和參與。為使工程能夠真正符合居民的需求，房屋署採用了不同方式進行公眾諮詢，廣泛收集居民及持份者對改善工程的建議，以協助工程團隊能更有效制定詳細的設計方案。

深水埗澤安邨的改善工程更是其中一個創新的嘗試。房委會在二○二五年一月至五月期間舉辦了「幸福在澤安」設計比賽，邀請公眾為屋邨內的改善工程提供設計方案。比賽成功吸引了超過150位優秀的年青設計師和學生參與，他們透過創新和貼心的設計詮釋「幸福設計」指引的理念，為澤安邨的公共空間注入新活力。所有入圍團隊均通過居民參與及共創過程，收集澤安邨居民對設計的意見，得獎作品不僅展現了參賽者的專業和創意能力，更體現了他們對居民需求的細心關注和理解，讓居民以一個新的方式參與屋邨的改善工程，增加居民的歸屬感及自豪感。

房委會一直積極推動構建關愛共融社區，並會聯同非政府機構及其他政府部門，舉辦不同形式的社區建設活動，以促進鄰舍守望相助及加強社區的凝聚力。為進一步深化與地區持份者的交流，房屋署於本年第二季起，陸續在各管理分區舉辦屋邨管理分享會，邀請地區持份者包括當區區議員參與，以分享屋邨管理經驗。房屋署職員亦向他們簡介房委會最新通過的政策及相關資訊，以及直接聆聽他們有關屋邨管理的建議及意見。

為進一步加強對長者及殘疾人士的關注及支援及聆聽他們的意見，房委會轄下各公共屋邨辦事處積極協助地區服務及關愛隊伍（關愛隊）推展關愛活動，籌劃社區活動及為有需要的家庭（包括長者、殘疾人士和照顧者住戶），提供探訪及支援服務等。此外，房委會各屋邨每年均夥拍非政府機構舉辦活動包括外展探訪。勞工及福利局與房屋署已加強協作，透過整合社會福利署轄下安老服務使用者的資料及房屋署公屋住戶資料，識別高風險的隱蔽住戶，在二○二五年七月中於觀塘區及沙田區推出試點計劃，並邀請關愛隊主動接觸及探訪這些長者、殘疾人士和照顧者住戶，了解他們的需要及介紹相關的支援服務。計劃有助加強他們的支援網絡，便利他們在緊急或有需要時尋求協助，同時亦可聽取他們對其他服務及屋邨管理的意見。

房委會會繼續致力優化與公屋住戶溝通的機制及措施，提供多元便捷的溝通渠道，提升公屋管理水平，締造和諧社區及加強公屋居民的幸福感和歸屬感。"

在國際調解院籌備辦公室主任孫勁博士和發展局常任秘書長（工務）劉俊傑的陪同下，林定國和崔建春參觀國際調解院總部大樓的主大堂、會議廳、調解室和展覽區等，並聽取建築署署長李翹彥介紹大樓的活化過程和各項設施。

國際調解院總部大樓由屬二級歷史建築的舊灣仔警署改建而成，工程以保留原有主要建築特色，並採取最少和可還原改動為設計原則，配合國際調解院總部的形象及功能。國際調解院作為世界上首個專門以調解方式解決國際爭端的政府間國際法律組織，總部座落香港商業中心區的地標建築，除彰顯其獨特國際地位和配合其運作需要，同時亦得以保育和活化舊灣仔警署，彰顯香港特別行政區（特區）政府對保育和活化歷史建築的重視和決心。

在特區政府積極推進和各方配合下，總部大樓工程迅速且高效地以約一年半時間便完成，達成去年《施政報告》附篇所提及總部工程目標在二○二五年年中基本完工，讓國際調解院總部在《關於建立國際調解院的公約》生效後正式落戶香港。隨着國際調解院總部大樓竣工，總部大樓將於八月一日正式交付國際調解院籌備辦公室，為國際調解院成立和開幕作好準備。律政司將全力支持國際調解院未來的工作，相信可與香港法律樞紐內多個相關區域或國際組織發揮協同效應，鞏固香港在國家「十四五」規劃下作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的定位，助力國家推展涉外法治及推進粵港澳大灣區建設和「一帶一路」等國家戰略。"
IOMed headquarters building project completed (with photos/video),2025-07-30 15:00,2025-07-30 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000420.htm,"  With the renovation project for the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) headquarters building completed, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Cui Jianchun, visited the headquarters building today (July 30), signifying that the building is fully equipped and ready to serve as the IOMed headquarters and for other related purposes in the future.

  Accompanied by the Director-General of the IOMed Preparatory Office, Dr Sun Jin, and the Permanent Secretary for Development (Works), Mr Ricky Lau, Mr Lam and Mr Cui toured various areas including the main lobby, conference rooms, mediation rooms and exhibition areas of the headquarters. They were briefed by the Director of Architectural Services, Mr Michael Li, on the revitalisation process and facilities of the building.

  The IOMed headquarters building was converted from the Old Wan Chai Police Station, a Grade-2 historic building. The design principle of the conversion was to complement the image and functionality of the IOMed headquarters by preserving the original architectural features of the old police station while adopting minimal and reversible alterations. As the first international intergovernmental legal organisation dedicated to the use of mediation in resolving international disputes, the IOMed headquarters is located in a landmark architectural building in the central business district of Hong Kong. This not only accentuates the special international status of the IOMed and accommodates its operational needs, but also fosters the conservation and revitalisation of the Old Wan Chai Police Station, reflecting the emphasis and determination of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in preserving and revitalising historical buildings.

  With the proactive efforts of the HKSAR Government and co-operation from various parties, the headquarters building project was completed quickly and efficiently in about a year and a half, fulfilling the target set out in the supplement of last year's Policy Address, which aimed for the substantial completion of the headquarters building in mid-2025 to enable the offi­cial establishment of the IOMed headquarters in Hong Kong after the entry into force of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation. Following the completion of the project, the headquarters building will be officially handed over to the IOMed Preparatory Office on August 1 to make good preparation use for the establishment and opening of the IOMed. The Department of Justice will fully support the IOMed's future work and is confident that, by leveraging synergy with various relevant regional or international organisations within Hong Kong's legal hub, it will help consolidate Hong Kong's positioning as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region under the National 14th Five-Year Plan, and contribute to the developmentof foreign-related rule of law of the country and the promotion of national strategies such as the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative."

在國際調解院籌備辦公室主任孫勁博士和發展局常任秘書長（工務）劉俊傑的陪同下，林定國和崔建春參觀國際調解院總部大樓的主大堂、會議廳、調解室和展覽區等，並聽取建築署署長李翹彥介紹大樓的活化過程和各項設施。

國際調解院總部大樓由屬二級歷史建築的舊灣仔警署改建而成，工程以保留原有主要建築特色，並採取最少和可還原改動為設計原則，配合國際調解院總部的形象及功能。國際調解院作為世界上首個專門以調解方式解決國際爭端的政府間國際法律組織，總部座落香港商業中心區的地標建築，除彰顯其獨特國際地位和配合其運作需要，同時亦得以保育和活化舊灣仔警署，彰顯香港特別行政區（特區）政府對保育和活化歷史建築的重視和決心。

在特區政府積極推進和各方配合下，總部大樓工程迅速且高效地以約一年半時間便完成，達成去年《施政報告》附篇所提及總部工程目標在二○二五年年中基本完工，讓國際調解院總部在《關於建立國際調解院的公約》生效後正式落戶香港。隨着國際調解院總部大樓竣工，總部大樓將於八月一日正式交付國際調解院籌備辦公室，為國際調解院成立和開幕作好準備。律政司將全力支持國際調解院未來的工作，相信可與香港法律樞紐內多個相關區域或國際組織發揮協同效應，鞏固香港在國家「十四五」規劃下作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的定位，助力國家推展涉外法治及推進粵港澳大灣區建設和「一帶一路」等國家戰略。"
IOMed headquarters building project completed (with photos),2025-07-30 15:00,2025-07-30 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000420.htm,"  With the renovation project for the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) headquarters building completed, the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Cui Jianchun, visited the headquarters building today (July 30), signifying that the building is fully equipped and ready to serve as the IOMed headquarters and for other related purposes in the future.

  Accompanied by the Director-General of the IOMed Preparatory Office, Dr Sun Jin, and the Permanent Secretary for Development (Works), Mr Ricky Lau, Mr Lam and Mr Cui toured various areas including the main lobby, conference rooms, mediation rooms and exhibition areas of the headquarters. They were briefed by the Director of Architectural Services, Mr Michael Li, on the revitalisation process and facilities of the building.

  The IOMed headquarters building was converted from the Old Wan Chai Police Station, a Grade-2 historic building. The design principle of the conversion was to complement the image and functionality of the IOMed headquarters by preserving the original architectural features of the old police station while adopting minimal and reversible alterations. As the first international intergovernmental legal organisation dedicated to the use of mediation in resolving international disputes, the IOMed headquarters is located in a landmark architectural building in the central business district of Hong Kong. This not only accentuates the special international status of the IOMed and accommodates its operational needs, but also fosters the conservation and revitalisation of the Old Wan Chai Police Station, reflecting the emphasis and determination of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in preserving and revitalising historical buildings.

  With the proactive efforts of the HKSAR Government and co-operation from various parties, the headquarters building project was completed quickly and efficiently in about a year and a half, fulfilling the target set out in the supplement of last year's Policy Address, which aimed for the substantial completion of the headquarters building in mid-2025 to enable the offi­cial establishment of the IOMed headquarters in Hong Kong after the entry into force of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation. Following the completion of the project, the headquarters building will be officially handed over to the IOMed Preparatory Office on August 1 to make good preparation use for the establishment and opening of the IOMed. The Department of Justice will fully support the IOMed's future work and is confident that, by leveraging synergy with various relevant regional or international organisations within Hong Kong's legal hub, it will help consolidate Hong Kong's positioning as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region under the National 14th Five-Year Plan, and contribute to the developmentof foreign-related rule of law of the country and the promotion of national strategies such as the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative."
立法會十八題：打擊從事駕駛及送貨工作的非法勞工,2025-07-30 14:52,2025-07-30 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000314.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上黎棟國議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

據報有持《往來港澳通行證》（俗稱雙程證）人士以旅客身份，在港駕駛非法載客取酬服務車輛（俗稱白牌車）。有意見認為，現時運輸署容許持有有效旅行證件的人士申請免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照（免試簽發駕駛執照），或會助長持雙程證人士甚至持有俗稱「行街紙」的免遣返聲請人士在港非法從事駕車載客或食物外送員等取酬工作。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年每年非香港居民申請免試簽發駕駛執照的數目，並按申請人所持證件／文（即外國護照、雙程證及行街紙）列出分項數字；

（二）過去五年每年政府處理的非法勞工案件數目；當中有多少宗涉及駕車載客或食物外送員工作的案件，以及涉案人士的居留身份分別為何；及

（三）會否考慮修改免試簽發駕駛執照政策，以堵塞持有有效旅行證件的訪客或行街紙人士可免試獲發駕駛執照後非法從事駕駛及送貨工作等的漏洞？

答覆：

主席：

根據《道路交通條例》（第374章）第52（3）條，任何人不得駕駛或使用汽車，或容受或允許他人駕駛或使用汽車，以作出租或取酬載客用途，除非該車輛領有生效的出租汽車許可證。政府一向十分關注任何人利用汽車作非法出租或取酬載客的情況，並一直採取針對性執法行動，以打擊非法出租或取酬載客活動。

就「免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照」（「免試簽發」）方面，運輸署是按照《道路交通（駕駛執照）規例》（第374B章）（《規例》）第11（3）條的規定處理申請，讓持有由《規例》附表4的32國家和地方（下稱「認可國家或地方」）所簽發的駕駛執照的人士，在符合指定條件下，可無須通過本地駕駛考試而獲直接簽發香港正式駕駛執照，以駕駛四種車輛類別：私家車、輕型貨車、電單車及機動三輪車。

在申請「免試簽發」時，有關認可國家或地方所簽發的駕駛執照必須屬仍然有效或有效期屆滿不超過三年，以及是申請人在簽發國家或地方經成功完成有關的駕駛考試後而獲得的。此外，申請人必須年滿十八歲，並符合以下其中一項條件：（1）持有的駕駛執照是申請人在簽發國家或地方居住不少過六個月的期間發出；或（2）在緊接申請前申請人已持有該認可國家或地方的駕駛執照不少於五年；或（3）申請人持有該駕駛執照簽發國家或地方的護照或同等的旅行證件。

就黎議員提問的各部分，經諮詢保安局和運輸署後，現回覆如下：

（一）根據《規例》第10條，「免試簽發」申請人如不是香港居民身份證持有人，須提交屬《入境條例》（第115章）第2(1)條所界定的有效旅行證件（例如護照或同等的有效旅行證件）作為其身分證明文件。運輸署並不接納任何人以入境事務處（入境處）發出的「表格8」擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）作為提交駕駛執照申請的有效身分證明文件。如運輸署對申請人提交的證明文件有懷疑，會向相關機構查證及確認。

（三）互認駕駛資格和容讓免試簽發駕駛執照是不少國家或地方的慣常做法，而「免試簽發」亦在香港實施多年，以便利來自不同地方的市民按當地的申請條件換領相關車輛種類的駕駛執照，省卻重新考核以領取當地駕駛執照的資源和時間。如上文所述，運輸署不接納以「行街紙」作為申請「免試簽發」的有效身分證明文件。至於符合前文提及的條件的護照或同等旅行證件持有人，則可以申請「免試簽發」。事實上，持有有效香港駕駛執照和港澳居民來往內地通行證的香港居民，亦可以在廣東省免試換領內地駕照。

運輸署會繼續就駕駛執照相關事宜與有關決策局和部門合作，包括把懷疑非法載客取酬的個案轉交相關執法部門跟進，並全力配合有關的調查工作。"
LCQ18: Crack down on illegal workers engaged in driving and delivery work,2025-07-30 14:52,2025-07-30 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000383.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lai Tung-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

It has been reported that some individuals holding Exit-entry Permits for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (commonly known as Two-way Exit Permits) have been driving vehicles in Hong Kong as tourists for illegal carriage of passengers for reward (commonly known as white licence cars). There are views that the Transport Department's current practice of allowing individuals with valid travel documents to apply for direct issue of full Hong Kong Driving Licences without test (direct issue of HKDLs) may encourage Two-way Exit Permit holders, or even non-refoulement claimants holding (commonly known as going-out passes), to illegally engage in work such as driving for carriage of passengers or food delivery in Hong Kong for reward. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of non-Hong Kong residents who applied for direct issue of HKDLs in each of the past five years, with a breakdown by the type of documents/papers held by the applicants (i.e. foreign passports, Two-way Exit Permits and going-out passes);

(2) of the number of illegal worker cases handled by the Government in each of the past five years; among such cases, the number of those involving driving for carriage of passengers or food delivery, and the immigration status of individuals involved in these cases; and

(3) whether it will consider revising the policy of direct issue of HKDLs in order to plug the loophole that allows visitors holding valid travel documents or individuals with going-out passes to obtain direct issue of HKDLs and subsequently illegally engage in work such as driving and delivery?

Reply:

President,

According to section 52(3) of the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374), no person shall drive or use a motor vehicle, or suffer or permit a motor vehicle to be driven or used, for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward unless a hire car permit (HCP) is in force in respect of the vehicle. The Government has all along been very concerned about the use of motor vehicles by any person for illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward, and has been taking targeted enforcement actions to combat illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward activities.

Regarding direct issue of a Hong Kong full driving licence without test (direct issue), the Transport Department handles direct issue applications in accordance with regulation 11(3) of the Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations (Cap. 374B) (the Regulations), which allows a person holding a driving licence issued by one of the 32 countries and places specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Regulations (recognised countries or places), and provided that specified conditions are met, to be directly issued with a Hong Kong full driving licence without taking a local driving test for driving four classes of vehicles: private cars, light goods vehicles, motor cycles and motor tricycles.

To apply for direct issue, the driving licence issued by the relevant recognised country or place must still be valid or expired for not more than three years, and be obtained by the applicant after successful completion of a driving test conducted in the issuing country or place. Also, the applicant must be aged 18 years or above and meet one of the following requirements: (1) the driving licence held was issued during a period of the applicant's residence of not less than six months in the issuing country or place; or (2) the applicant has been holding the driving licence issued by the recognised country or place for not less than five years immediately prior to the application; or (3) the applicant is the holder of a passport or other equivalent travel document issued in the country or place in which the driving licence was issued.

In consultation with the Security Bureau and the Transport Department (TD), our reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Lai Tung-kwok is as follows:

(1) According to regulation 10 of the Regulations, an applicant for direct issue who is not a holder of Hong Kong identity card shall submit a valid travel document as defined in section 2(1) of the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115) (for example, a passport or equivalent valid travel document) as his/her identity document. The TD does not accept any person on recognisance holding form no. 8 issued by the Immigration Department (ImmD) as a valid identity document for submitting a driving licence application. If the TD has doubts about the supporting documents submitted by the applicant, it will verify and confirm with the relevant agencies.

According to TD's record, over the past five years, the number of direct issue applications approved by the types of identity documents other than Hong Kong identity card including passports, Exit/Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao (commonly known as Two-way Permits) etc., are tabulated below:

Note 1: Other identity documents include the Consular Corps Identity Card.

(2) The Government is committed to combatting illegal employment, with a view to protecting job opportunities for the local workforce. It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Employers, illegal workers as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115). Illegal immigrants and non-refoulement claimants, etc., who take any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establish or join in any business, are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. Besides, any person who takes up any employment, whether paid or unpaid, in contravention of a condition of stay, shall be guilty of an offence. Upon conviction, he/she is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment.

(3) Mutual recognition of driving qualifications and the issuance of driving licences without test are common practices in many countries or places, and direct issue has also been implemented in Hong Kong for many years, with a view to facilitating citizens in different places to obtain driving licences for relevant vehicle classes in accordance with local application criteria, saving the resources and time of taking assessments and obtaining local driving licences afresh. As mentioned above, the TD does not accept a recognisance form as a valid identity document for applying for direct issue. For holders of passports or equivalent travel documents that meet the conditions mentioned above, they can apply for direct issue. In fact, Hong Kong residents holding a valid Hong Kong driving licence and a Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents can also obtain a Mainland driving licence without test in Guangdong Province.

The TD will continue to collaborate with relevant policy bureaux and departments on driving licence-related matters, including referring any suspected cases of illegal carriage of passengers for reward to relevant law enforcement agencies for follow-up, fully co-operating with relevant investigations."

LCQ16: Promoting gender mainstreaming,2025-07-30 14:45,2025-07-30 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000296.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Judy Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

Since 2002, the Government has progressively implemented ""gender mainstreaming"" in its policy and programme areas, taking into account the perspectives and needs of both genders as one of the key considerations in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of legislation, policies and programmes. This ensures that both genders have equitable access to, and benefit from, society's resources and opportunities. However, there are views that a number of existing reference documents and publications relating to gender mainstreaming (e.g. the Gender Mainstreaming Guidebook and related leaflets, as well as the Gender Mainstreaming Checklist for Government staff) have not been updated for more than 10 years, and their contents may no longer keep pace with current developments. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the details of the actual examples of gender mainstreaming implemented by various policy bureaux and government departments in the past three years;

(2) whether it knows the details of the future plans of the Women's Commission to promote gender mainstreaming in various trades and industries and among the public; and

(3) whether it has plans to update the reference documents and publications relating to gender mainstreaming; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The reply to the question raised by the Hon Judy Chan is as follows:

Gender mainstreaming is a global strategy advocated by the United Nations for the promotion of women's advancement and gender equality. It aims to ensure that the needs and perspectives of women and men are considered when conducting day-to-day work and making policies, so as to ensure that women and men have equitable access to, and benefit from, society's resources and opportunities.

The Government attaches great importance in promoting gender mainstreaming within the Government by establishing a gender-sensitive decision-making process and systematically integrating gender perspectives and needs into the policy formulation process to fully implement gender mainstreaming. To assist government staff to implement gender mainstreaming, the Women's Commission (WoC) developed a Gender Mainstreaming Checklist (the Checklist), which assisted government departments to adopt gender mainstreaming in a more systematic manner by answering a series of questions. Since April 1, 2015, all Government bureaux and departments shall refer to the Checklist and apply gender mainstreaming when formulating major government policies and initiatives. To date, the Government has reviewed over 1800 policy papers, and relevant policies and initiatives have incorporated gender mainstreaming with reference to the Checklist prior to implementation, striving to ensure that the needs of women are taken into consideration. These initiatives are broad in scope, covering different policy areas and facility designs.

The Government is also committed to enhancing public servants' understanding of gender-related issues and gender mainstreaming. To this end, the Government provides training for officers of different grades and ranks regularly. Since 2001, over 17000 officers have received relevant training. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) also developed related e-learning courses for government officers' reference.

The Government and the WoC have also been working closely to promote the concept of gender mainstreaming to all sectors of society through various channels. The HYAB and the WoC organise the International Women's Day Reception every year to raise public awareness on various issues of common concern to women. The reception featured exhibition panels that introduced concepts including gender mainstreaming. Additionally, since September 2022, the WoC has been organising school talks for kindergarten and lower primary students to raise their gender awareness by introducing to students the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, promoting gender equality and challenging gender stereotype. Students are also taught on applying these concepts in daily lives. The WoC has organised 150 school talks so far.

Furthermore, the HYAB and the WoC have officially launched the ""She Inspires"" Mentorship Programme, which matches local female university students who aspire to pursue a career in the professional or business sectors with women leader mentors, and provides relevant training and activities. We will also take this opportunity to include gender-related training to let more young people understand the concept of gender mainstreaming. The HYAB and the WoC will also make good use of different platforms, including the luncheon with women leaders and the Family and Women Development Summit, to further promote gender mainstreaming to all sectors of society.

Gender mainstreaming is the United Nations' key strategy to promote women's interest and to achieve gender equality. The Government will review existing reference documents and tools related to gender mainstreaming from time to time and adjust their contents as necessary to ensure their applicability. We will also continue to publish articles or information related to gender mainstreaming and promote gender mainstreaming to the public through various channels, such as uploading articles related to gender mainstreaming to the one-stop family and women information portal launched in October 2024. The Government will continue to work hand in hand with the WoC to promote the well-being and interests of women through a three-pronged strategy, namely the provision of an enabling environment, empowerment of women through capacity building and public education."

政府自二○○二年起在政策和工作範疇逐步推行「性別主流化」，以在設計、實施、監察和評估法例、政策和計劃時，把男性及女性的觀點和需要作為其中一項主要的考慮因素，確保兩性可以同等享有及受惠於社會的資源和機會。然而，有意見認為現時多項與性別主流化相關的參考文件及刊物（例如《性別主流化手冊》與相關單張，以及供政府人員使用的性別主流化檢視清單等）已超過10年未作更新，其內容未必能跟上時代的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年各政策局及政府部門推行性別主流化的實例詳情為何；

（二）是否知悉婦女事務委員會未來就向各行業及公眾推廣性別主流化的計劃詳情為何；及

（三）有否計劃更新性別主流化相關的參考文件及刊物；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳家珮議員的提問，現回覆如下：

性別主流化是一項由聯合國提倡促進婦女權益及兩性平等的全球性策略，目標旨在促使決策者在處理日常事務及制訂政策時，把兩性的需要和觀點列為決策過程中必須考慮的因素，從而保障兩性可以公平合理地獲取和享有社會的資源和機會。

政府十分重視透過建立具性別敏感度的決策過程，於政府內推廣性別主流化，並透過在制訂政策的過程中有系統地納入不同性別的觀點及需要，有效地落實性別主流化。為了協助政府人員推行性別主流化，婦女事務委員會（婦委會）編製了性別主流化檢視清單（檢視清單），利用一系列問題，協助政府部門更有系統地在制訂政策及措施時考慮性別主流化。自二○一五年四月一日起，政府所有決策局及部門在制訂主要政府政策及措施時須參考檢視清單，應用性別主流化。政府至今檢視超過1800份政策文件，而相關政策和措施在推出前亦已參考檢視清單應用性別主流化，致力確保女性的需要被納入考慮當中。這些措施的範圍十分廣泛，涉及不同的政策範疇及設施設計等。

政府亦致力增強公職人員對性別課題和性別主流化的認識。為此，政府定期向不同職系及職級的人員提供培訓，二○○一年起至今，已有超過17000名人員接受相關培訓。民政及青年事務局（民青局）亦製作了有關的網上課程，供政府人員參考。

政府和婦委會亦一直緊密合作，透過不同途徑，向社會各界別推廣性別主流化的概念。民青局與婦委會每年舉辦國際婦女節酒會，提升公眾對婦女共同關注的課題的認識。酒會設有展板介紹包括性別主流化等的概念。另外，婦委會自二○二二年九月起為幼稚園和初小學生舉辦到校講座，旨在提升學生的性別意識，包括向學生介紹聯合國《消除對婦女一切形式歧視公約》、提倡有關男女平等，以及避免性別定型等關鍵信息，並教導學生在日常生活中實踐這些理念。至今婦委會已舉辦150場到校講座。

此外，民青局和婦委會已經正式推出「『友』妳啟導」友師計劃，為有志投身專業行業或商界的本港女大學生配對女性領袖友師，並提供相關培訓及活動。我們亦會藉此機會加入與性別課題相關的培訓，讓更多年輕人認識性別主流化的概念。民青局和婦委會日後亦會善用不同平台，包括與女性領袖午餐會、家庭暨婦女發展高峰會等，進一步向社會各界推廣性別主流化。

性別主流化作為聯合國為促進婦女權益及兩性平等而推行的重要策略，政府會不時檢視現有與性別主流化相關參考文件和工具，並按需要調整內容，以確保其適用性。我們亦會持續推出與性別主流化相關的文章或資料，通過不同途徑向公眾推廣性別主流化，例如我們已經於二○二四年十月推出的一站式家庭及婦女資訊平台，上載與性別主流化有關的文章。政府將繼續與婦委會攜手合作，通過三管齊下的策略，即提供有利的環境、增強婦女能力和推行公眾教育，以促進婦女的福祉及權益。"
立法會：醫務衞生局局長根據《輻射條例》動議的擬議決議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 14:42,2025-07-30 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000521.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上根據《輻射條例》動議的擬議決議案的開場發言：

主席：

我謹就提交各位議員傳閱的文件內所載我名下的議案，動議依照該議案通過《2025年輻射（管制輻照儀器）（修訂）規例》。

今次立法建議旨在作出技術性修訂，更新載列於現行《輻射（管制輻照儀器）規例》（第303B章）中眼睛晶狀體的職業劑量限值，以配合國際放射防護委員會International Commission on Radiological Protection，簡稱ICRP所建議的最新國際標準。這個限值是由香港輻射管理局為本地擔任輻射工作的人士所訂定的安全標準，將可更好預防從業員患上輻射引致的白內障。

ICRP是一個獨立運作的非牟利國際組織，目標是推動輻射防護科研以保障公眾福祉，其建議一向獲全球各地廣泛採納。其中，ICRP於二○一一年審視最新科學證據後，建議收緊眼睛晶狀體的職業劑量限值，由每年150毫希沃特，修改為於五年內平均每年20毫希沃特，並且在任何一年內不超過50毫希沃特。自此，這個新標準已獲多個國家／地區和國際組織陸續採用。

在香港，輻射管理局於二○一七年委託衞生署進行調查，初步顯示本地從業員普遍可遵守ICRP的新標準，並因此再委託衞生署於二○二○年諮詢持份者，包括香港醫學專科學院、公立醫院、私家醫院及放射性藥物供應商等。所有回應者均對收緊第303B章中眼睛晶狀體的職業劑量限值表示同意或不持異議。

經考慮業界回應後，輻射管理局在二○二○年十二月建議政府修例。政府亦同步籌備配套工作，確保香港業界能夠符合新標準。縱使工作進度受早前新冠疫情影響，衞生署已於二○二五年三月起為本地從業員推出眼睛晶狀體職業輻射劑量的監察服務，有助實施經修訂後的規例。輻射管理局亦於二○二五年六月十六日正式通過第303B章的修訂建議，由政府現時向立法會提交草案，以供考慮。

主席，我謹此陳辭，提出上述動議。"
立法會四題：規管電動可移動工具的使用及銷售,2025-07-30 14:30,2025-07-30 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000426.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上劉國勳議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

政府近年多番表示計劃立法規管電動可移動工具。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述立法工作的詳情和最新進展為何，以及預計有關法例何時生效；鑑於根據政府資料，過去五年涉及電動可移動工具交通意外的被捕人數不斷上升，政府會否在相關條例草案中提高該等交通意外的罰則，以加強阻嚇力；

（二）鑑於現行法例下，售賣電動可移動工具並不違法，但有意見認為該等產品的電池質量存疑，發生意外風險高，政府有否計劃規管售賣該等產品的網上和實體商店，以確保其售賣的產品符合擬議的技術和安全要求；如有，計劃詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）據報目前電動可移動工具使用者遍布各區，不少外賣員及長者均以其作日常代步工具，政府會否在平衡安全、技術標準、執法可行性及使用情況等因素後，除開放單車徑外，提供更多可供電動可移動工具行走的範圍和路段，以令有關規管安排更切合實際情況？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來對推動綠色出行的新科技秉持開放態度，同時非常重視道路安全。電動可移動工具是由機械驅動，符合《道路交通條例》（第374章）中「汽車」的定義，因此現時必須領牌才可於道路或私家路上行駛。我們留意到電動可移動工具在世界各地日趨普及，但香港人口密集，人流量高、車流量大，有需要適當規管電動可移動工具的使用，才可用作有效且安全的短途出行選項。

就劉國勳議員提問的各部分，經諮詢運輸署，現綜合回覆如下：

電動可移動工具主要包括兩類：（一）電動個人移動工具，例如電動滑板車、電動單輪車（俗稱「風火輪」）及電動平衡車等；及（二）電動輔助單車。政府正積極研究循以下幾個方向規管電動可移動工具。

首先，使用地點方面，電動可移動工具可作為短途出行和首／尾程接駁鐵路站和車站等的代步工具，讓市民有更多主動出行方式選擇。運輸署已經積極與相關部門商討，在新發展區例如洪水橋新發展區，建設全面的單車徑網絡，亦會在其他地區選取合適的單車徑，容納單車及電動可移動工具同時安全行駛，除非該些單車徑個別而言不符合特定的要求，例如闊度不足、與行人路或行車道交替頻繁等。至於電動輔助單車，基於它們的操作模式近似單車，我們計劃容許它們在所有單車徑上使用。

此外，因應電動可移動工具的設計和相關營運模式等亦有變化，運輸署於二○二三至二四年在白石角進行共享電動輔助單車試驗計劃。該計劃運作大致順暢，並顯示共享模式需要適當配套如充電池設施及充電頻率等，供政府在規劃電動可移動工具可使用路段時作參考。

至於能否開放單車徑以外的地點，政府理解市民對於電動可移動工具的接受程度不盡相同。在過去的調查中，有六成多受訪者支持在單車徑上使用經妥善規管的電動可移動工具，其餘三成則持保留意見，關注其潛在風險和現有單車徑的空間有限。政府會小心考慮不同意見，以確保道路安全。

第二，產品規管方面，為確保產品安全，運輸署正就電動可移動工具制訂技術和安全要求，並計劃要求由獲第三方機構認可的認證機構測試各產品的技術規格及電機要求。電動可移動工具的生產商或代理須向認證機構申請認證，獲認證的產品會貼上二維碼認證標籤，方便市民及執法人員辨識。至於問題中提到的電池及電子設備，我們認為有需要根據國際標準進行認證測試，例如過度充電或放電控制、短路及過熱防禦、振動和機械衝擊測試等，以確保產品安全。

為確保產品認證在香港市場切實可行，運輸署早前已諮詢業界，業界一般認為安排合理。運輸署正物色具備條件的認證機構，並聯同香港生產力促進局合作草擬產品認證安排的細節，亦會繼續仔細考慮不同持份者的角色和責任，以規管產品安全，讓市民可安心選購和適當使用。

第三，使用者方面，建議使用者必須年滿16歲及須佩戴頭盔。政府已成立包括業界代表和政府部門的工作小組，制訂《實務守則》，訂明電動可移動工具的技術細節、操作規則、安全提示及指引等。運輸署會繼續進行宣傳和教育的工作，灌輸正確的駕駛態度，讓市民安全及負責任地使用。

第四，罰則方面，我們認為罰則應與其使用風險相稱。與騎單車相似的違規行為如魯莽駕駛，可參考與單車相關的罰則，至於若干較嚴重的罪行如非法改裝，可參考與汽車相關的罰則。

因應上述四方面，政府正同時進行有關的法律草擬工作，糅合實際經驗以確保立法建議切實可行。由於議題涉及範圍廣泛，我們計劃於短期內向立法會交通事務委員會報告進展，並爭取在明年將修訂《道路交通條例》的條例草案以及新的附屬法例提交立法會審議。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Regulating use and sale of electric mobility devices,2025-07-30 14:30,2025-07-30 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000432.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lau Kwok-fan and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

In recent years, the Government has repeatedly indicated its plan to enact legislation to regulate electric mobility devices (EMDs). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the details and latest progress of the aforesaid legislative exercise, and the expected timeline for the relevant legislation to come into effect; given that according to government information, the number of persons arrested in traffic accidents involving EMDs had been continuously increasing in the past five years, whether the Government will impose in the relevant bill heavier penalties on non-compliance involving such traffic accidents, with a view to enhancing the deterrent effect;

(2) given that while the sale of EMDs is not an illegal activity under the existing legislation, there are views that the quality of the batteries of such products is questionable and the risk of accidents is high, whether the Government has plans to regulate the online and physical stores selling such products, so as to ensure that the products on sale comply with the proposed technical and safety requirements; if so, of the details of the plans; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as it has been reported that at present, EMDs are widely used in different districts, and quite a number of takeaway food couriers and elderly people use EMDs as a mode of everyday transport, whether the Government will, upon striking a balance among factors such as safety, technical standards, feasibility of law enforcement and situation of usage, provide more areas and road sections for the use of EMDs, in addition to opening up cycle tracks, so as to ensure the relevant regulatory arrangements to better align with the practical circumstances?

Reply:

President,

The Government has always adopted an open attitude towards new technologies for promoting green commuting, whilst attaching great importance to road safety. As electric mobility devices (EMDs) are mechanically propelled, they fall within the definition of ""motor vehicles"" under the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374) (the Ordinance) and must be licensed before use on roads or private roads. We note that EMDs are becoming increasingly popular around the world. However, given the dense population and high passenger and vehicular flow in Hong Kong, we consider that EMDs should be properly regulated before they can be used to provide effective and safe short-distance commuting options.

In consultation with the Transport Department (TD), my comprehensive reply to the different parts of the question raised by the Hon Lau Kwok-fan is as follows:

EMDs mainly include two categories: (a) motorised personal mobility devices such as electric scooters, electric unicycles and electric hoverboards; and (b) power assisted pedal cycles (PAPCs). The Government is actively looking into the regulation of EMDs along the following directions.

Firstly, regarding the locations for use, EMDs can serve as commuting means for short-distance travel and first-mile/last-mile connectivity to and from railway stations and stations, etc, providing the general public with more options of active transport modes. The TD has been proactively discussing with relevant departments the construction of comprehensive cycle track networks in new development areas such as the Hung Shui Kiu New Development Area, and will select suitable cycle tracks in other areas that can accommodate the safe co-use of bicycles and EMDs, except on individual basis, those cycle tracks which do not fulfil the particular requirements (e.g. insufficient width or frequent crossings with pedestrian footpath and vehicular roads). As for power assisted pedal cycles, we propose allowing them to be used on all cycle tracks since their operating mode is similar to that of bicycles.

Furthermore, given the ongoing changes in the design and operating mode of EMDs, the TD carried out a trial scheme on the shared use of power assisted pedal cycles in Pak Shek Kok from 2023 to 2024. The implementation of the trial scheme was smooth in general and the results indicate that suitable ancillary facilities (e.g. charging facilities and frequency of charging) will be needed for the operation of the shared mode. The Government will make reference to such experience when planning for the road sections for use of EMDs.

With regard to whether it is possible to open locations other than cycle tracks, the Government understands that public acceptance of EMDs varies. In previous surveys, over 60 per cent of the respondents supported the use of properly regulated EMDs on cycle tracks, while the remaining 30-odd per cent of the respondents expressed reservation, with the main concerns being the potential risks of EMDs as well as the limited space of existing cycle tracks. The Government will carefully consider the differing views to ensure road safety.

Secondly, regarding product regulation, to ensure product safety, the TD is formulating technical and safety requirements for EMDs, and plans to require third-party accredited certification bodies to test the technical specifications as well as the electrical and mechanical requirements of the various products. Manufacturers or agents of EMDs will be required to apply to the certification bodies for certification of products, and certified products will be affixed with a QR code certification label for easy identification by the public and enforcement officers. With regard to the batteries and electronic devices mentioned in the question, we consider that it is necessary for them to be certified according to international standards, e.g. over-charging or discharging control, short-circuit and overheating protection, vibration and mechanical shock tests, to ensure product safety.

To ensure that the product certification is practical in the Hong Kong market, the TD has been consulting the trade, who generally finds the proposed arrangements reasonable. The TD is identifying certification bodies that possess the relevant capabilities and is working in collaboration with the Hong Kong Productivity Council to formulate the details of the relevant certification arrangements, and will continue to give careful consideration to the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders with a view to regulating product safety, so that members of the public can feel confident when purchasing EMDs and use them properly.

Thirdly, regarding users, EMDs users must be at least 16 years old and wear a helmet. The Government has set up a working group, comprising representatives from the trade and Government departments, to formulate a code of practice to set out the technical details, operating rules, as well as safety advice and guidelines etc, regarding EMDs. The TD will continue its work on publicity and education, instilling into EMD users proper driving attitude to ensure the safe and responsible use of EMDs.

Fourthly, regarding the issue of penalties, we consider that the penalties should be proportionate to the risks of using EMDs. For violations similar to those of cycling such as reckless driving, reference can be made to the penalties related to cycling. As for certain more serious offences such as illegal modifications, reference can be made to the penalties related to motor vehicles.

Considering the aforementioned four aspects, the Government is undertaking the relevant law drafting work, and will take into consideration the actual experience to ensure the practicality of the proposal. As the topic has a wide coverage, we plan to report the progress to the Legislative Council Panel on Transport shortly, with the aim of introducing the Bill for amending the Ordinance and the new subsidiary legislation into the Legislative Council for scrutiny next year.

Thank you, President."

​立法會：運輸及物流局局長根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-30 14:26,2025-07-30 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000501.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》及《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》動議的兩項擬議決議案的開場發言：

主席：

我謹動議通過印載於議程內，以我名義提出的第一項決議案，上調《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》訂明有關違例泊車的定額罰款。我將稍後動議通過印載於議程內我的第二項決議案，上調《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》附表內與道路安全和交通擠塞有關的其中19項罪行的定額罰款。

違例泊車和大部分交通違例事項的定額罰款自一九九四年，即31年以來維持不變，而同期的消費物價指數已上升超過70%，罰款的阻嚇力或有所抵銷。縱使警務處一直按照重點交通執法項目切實執法，打擊各類型的交通罪行，保障交通安全與道路暢通，部分交通罪行，例如超速駕駛、沒有遵從道路標記、橫過連續雙白線、駕駛時使用流動電話等的執法數字，仍有上升或居高不下的趨勢，反映現行的罰款額已不足以發揮應有的阻嚇力。交通意外數字方面，在今年第一季的交通意外中，致命交通意外宗數和死亡人數均比去年同期大幅上升四成。此外，駕駛者在路旁違泊可能引致交通擠塞，甚至阻礙行人視線而影響道路安全。警務處因違例泊車而發出定額罰款通知書的數字持續高企，交通諮詢委員會在二○二五年第一季收到違泊的投訴有370宗，較去年同期增加了10%，可見市民都希望盡快改善違泊的問題。

事實上，香港的交通違例事項定額罰款水平遠較多個海外地區為低，以違例泊車為例，新加坡、倫敦和澳洲新南威爾斯州的罰款水平，折換成港元計算，最高達香港水平的10倍。至於超速駕駛，上述地區的罰款水平，最高更達香港水平的22倍。

為了恢復定額罰款應有的阻嚇力，保障交通安全和交通暢順，政府認為實有必要提高香港法例第237章內違例泊車罪行及第240章內19項有關道路安全和導致交通擠塞的罪行的罰款額。我們在今年四月就調整罰款額的建議諮詢立法會交通事務委員會。委員普遍認同調整的需要。

就違例泊車罰款的調整，有議員在交通事務委員會的討論上，建議政府增加泊車位供應及在對違例泊車執法時酌情處理。就增加泊車位供應，政府非常認同，亦一直致力增加泊車位，過往幾年積極推展一系列短、中、長期措施，在香港有限的空間、狹窄車多的道路，努力在每區盡量劃設泊車位，過程中顧及地區意見。在過去三年，全港已新增超過15 000個泊車位，當中有三分之一是商用車位，私家車的泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例上升至1.14。而未來兩年，政府預計可再增加超過12 000個泊車位，當中包括700個商用車位，加上私人發展項目和短期租約停車場的泊車位，我們會積極工作，努力推進，令本港泊車位供應持續大為改善。

在商用車輛方面，現時泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例為0.66。我們未來會繼續多管齊下增加商用車泊車位，重點措施包括積極加大力度增加路旁夜間泊車位、放寬禁區供貨車上落貨或方便小巴上落客、將部分的士站劃作的士停泊處、與房屋署繼續密切安排將現有合適的資助房屋範圍內的上落客貨處在夜間也開放給商用車停泊等。至於執法方面，警務處進行交通執法時，主要考慮是確保道路安全，以及維持道路暢順。警務人員會視乎現場實際環境靈活判斷，或會就個別情況作酌情處理，但如違泊情況影響道路安全，警務處會果斷採取執法行動。事實上，警務處就違例泊車發出的定額罰款通知書，由二○二二年的330萬張下降至二○二四年的250萬張，降幅約25%。

我們非常明白部分議員對運輸業界泊車情況的關注，然而我希望讓社會及各位議員理解，無論是商用車或私家車，違例停泊都會影響行人及其他駕駛者的視線，而商用車由於一般體積較大，如違泊迫使途人「攝車罅」，對過馬路的行人，尤其是長者及幼童，構成的風險更高。因此，政府本着保障市民生命安全的重大原則，需要對商用車和私家車違泊罰款水平的處理一致。今次違泊定額罰款的加幅較自上次修訂以來的通脹率比較實屬溫和，而政府亦會一如前述積極改善及增加泊位供應。

主席，我建議根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》第13條，將該條例訂明有關違例泊車的定額罰款，調高25%，由現時320元調高至400元，以及根據《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》第12條，將該條例附表內與道路安全和交通擠塞有關的其中19項罪行的定額罰款，調高50%，由現時的320元至1,000元不等，調高至480元至1,500元不等，生效日期訂定為二○二六年一月一日。

在動議獲立法會通過後，警務處處長將按該兩條條例的條文指明新的罰款通知書及電子罰款通知書的格式，而房屋委員會亦將對《房屋（交通違例事項）（定額罰款）附例》的指定表格，即定額罰款通知書，作出相應修訂。

主席，我謹此陳辭，希望能獲得議會支持，通過議案。多謝主席。"
立法會六題：《保障消費者防詐騙約章》,2025-07-30 14:18,2025-07-30 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000404.htm,"以下是今日（七月三十日）在立法會會議上陳振英議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的答覆：

問題：

香港金融管理局（下稱「金管局」）分別於二○二三年及去年與香港銀行公會推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章》（下稱「《約章》」）與《約章2.0》，並於今年七月聯同其他監管機構推出《約章3.0》，旨在透過與科技及電訊公司建立合作框架，共同打擊針對香港公眾的金融詐騙及欺詐行為。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，自《約章》及《約章2.0》推出至今，金管局有否檢視參與機構執行《約章》及《約章2.0》各項原則的情況及成效；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於《約章3.0》將合作主體進一步擴大至科技與電訊行業，通過跨界合作打擊金融詐騙，政府及金管局期望達到哪些具體目標，並為目標制訂了哪些績效指標；及

（三）鑑於《約章3.0》訂明，參與機構將根據其商業模式以自願方式履行約章承諾，在此前提下金管局如何確保各參與機構能有效配合政策方向，並達到整體預期成效？

答覆：

主席：

近年，釣魚訊息的詐騙手法盛行，騙徒會假扮一些知名商戶，套取市民的信用卡資料和銀行戶口資料騙取金錢。有見及此，香港金融管理局（金管局）聯同香港銀行公會在二○二三年六月推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章1.0》（《約章1.0》），旨在提高公眾對保護信用卡及個人資料的意識。全港共有23間發卡銀行和15間大型商戶參與《約章1.0》，承諾不會透過任何即時電子訊息向客戶發送超連結要求他們於線上提供個人和信用卡資料，並會通過各種渠道向公眾傳遞「提防騙案」的訊息。

因應詐騙手法擴展至偽冒各類金融機構，如銀行、證券商、保險公司或強積金（強制性公積金）受託人等，金管局在二○二四年四月推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章2.0》（《約章2.0》）。《約章2.0》獲得超過300間金融機構及商戶參與，涵蓋更多日常生活範疇，包括金融服務、餐飲、物流、運輸、旅遊、零售等。

有見詐騙情況日趨複雜，騙徒除了使用傳統的電訊工具，例如電話或手機短訊嘗試接觸受害人，亦透過網上平台犯案。國際間，各地政府與監管機構逐漸意識到科技和電訊公司在打擊詐騙和欺詐行為上的重要角色。金管局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會、保險業監管局，以及強制性公積金計劃管理局於二○二五年七月聯合推出《保障消費者防詐騙約章3.0》（《約章3.0》），以期透過與科技和電訊公司建立合作框架，共同打擊針對香港公眾的金融詐騙及欺詐行為。《約章3.0》亦得到消費者委員會、香港銀行公會、香港警務處及通訊事務管理局辦公室的全力支持。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢金管局，我現答覆如下：

（一）金管局一直有檢視《約章1.0》與《約章2.0》的執行情況。根據警方的數字，釣魚詐騙從二○二三年的4 322宗下降至二○二四年的2 731宗，涉及損失由二○二三年的1億2百萬港元下降至二○二四年的5千4百萬港元，反映《約章1.0》和《約章2.0》有助提高公眾對釣魚詐騙的認識，對防範釣魚詐騙發揮了一定成效。

（二）《約章3.0》將參與機構擴展至科技和電訊公司，標誌着金融、科技和電訊業共同合作打擊騙案的新開始。《約章3.0》旨在提升四方面的果效。第一，在舉報疑似詐騙和欺詐方面，參與機構將為用戶提供舉報功能，並為金融監管機構提供直接高效的渠道，以舉報疑似詐騙和欺詐的行為，作出適當跟進。第二，在檢查廣告商方面，參與機構將採取風險為本的方針驗證廣告商，並制訂內部政策和工具，以監察其平台上的金融產品或服務的廣告及內容。第三，在移除詐騙廣告方面，參與機構承諾切實執行其服務條款，偵測及移除違反其平台政策的金融詐騙廣告或內容。第四，在提高公眾防騙意識方面，參與機構將與金融監管機構及金融業界合作，推出各種反詐騙宣傳活動，以提高公眾防騙意識。

《約章3.0》促成的跨界別合作，將令騙徒行騙的難度增加，從而幫助市民防範騙案和減少損失。

（三）《約章3.0》涵蓋在香港經營的主要海外和內地資訊科技平台（包括即時通訊軟件、社交媒體、影音串流和搜尋引擎），以及近乎所有香港的主要電訊服務供應商，包括固定網絡營辦商、流動網絡營辦商和互聯網服務供應商。由於參與《約章3.0》的科技和電訊公司所經營的平台以及提供的服務各有不同，各平台可按情況，自身的業務範圍及商業模式，相稱地採納措施，以落實執行《約章3.0》的原則。此安排既可善用各間科技和電訊公司自身的工具和優勢進行防範詐騙和保障用戶的工作，亦可保留彈性應對不斷演變的行騙手法和犯案模式，以加強香港整體反詐騙生態圈的能力和效果。金管局聯同其他監管機構會與參與機構保持溝通，確保參與機構能因應自身的服務模式和最新的騙案手法採取有效的措施，協助市民防騙。

打擊金融詐騙需要社會各界共同努力。政府將持續採取多方面措施，優化跨界別協作，以在更好保障市民的同時，鞏固香港的金融體系安全。

謝謝主席。"
LCQ6: Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter,2025-07-30 14:18,2025-07-30 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000405.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Chun-ying and a reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 30):

Question:

 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Association of Banks, launched the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter (Charter) and the Charter 2.0 in 2023 and last year respectively. In July this year, HKMA launched the Charter 3.0 in collaboration with other regulators, with a view to jointly combatting financial fraud and scams targeting the Hong Kong public through establishing a collaborative framework with technology firms and telecommunications firms. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows if HKMA has, since the launch of the Charter and the Charter 2.0, reviewed participating institutions' implementation of the various principles under the Charter and the Charter 2.0 and the effectiveness thereof; if HKMA has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as the Charter 3.0 further extends the co-operating parties to include the technology and telecommunications sectors, so as to combat financial fraud through cross-sector co-operation, of the specific objectives which the Government and HKMA expect to achieve, and the performance indicators formulated for such objectives; and

(3) as the Charter 3.0 provides that participating institutions will fulfill Charter commitments based on their business models in a voluntary manner, how HKMA ensures, on this premise, that participating institutions can effectively dovetail with the policy direction and deliver the overall intended outcomes?

Reply:

President,

 In recent years, phishing scams have become prevalent. Scammers would pose as reputable merchants to obtain citizens' credit card and bank account details for monetary gain. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) jointly launched the ""Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter"" (Charter 1.0) in June 2023 to enhance public awareness of safeguarding credit card and personal information. All 23 card-issuing banks and 15 merchant institutions in Hong Kong participated in Charter 1.0, committing not to send instant electronic messages to customers with embedded hyperlinks to request personal and credit card information online, and to convey the message of ""Beware of scams"" to the public through various channels.

 As scammers expanded their tactics to impersonate various financial institutions, such as banks, securities firms, insurers, Mandatory Provident Fund trustees, the HKMA introduced the ""Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0"" (Charter 2.0) in April 2024. Over 300 financial institutions and merchants joined Charter 2.0, extending its coverage to more aspects of daily life, including financial services, food and beverage, logistics, transport, tourism, retail.

 Scams continue to evolve. Scammers not only use traditional telecommunications tools like phone calls or SMS to reach out to victims, but also exploit online platforms. Governments and regulators worldwide have increasingly recognised the critical role of technology and telecommunications firms in combating scams and fraud. The HKMA, the Securities and Futures Commission, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority jointly launched the ""Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 3.0"" (Charter 3.0) in July 2025, to establish a collaborative framework with technology and telecommunications firms to combat financial scams and fraud targeting the Hong Kong public. Charter 3.0 also received full support from the Consumer Council, the HKAB, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Office of the Communications Authority.

 Having consulted the HKMA, my reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The HKMA has been reviewing the implementation of Charter 1.0 and Charter 2.0. Statistics from the HKPF show that the number of phishing scams decreased from 4 322 in 2023 to 2 731 in 2024, with losses dropping from HK$102 million to HK$54 million over the same period. This reflects that Charter 1.0 and Charter 2.0 have helped raise public awareness and curb phishing scams.

(2) Charter 3.0 expands participation to include technology and telecommunications firms, marking a new chapter of cross-sector collaboration among financial, technology and telecommunications industries in combating fraud. Charter 3.0 aims to enhance effectiveness in four key areas. First, regarding reporting of suspected scams and fraud, participating firms will put in place user reporting functions and establish direct and efficient channels for financial regulators to report and follow up on suspected scams and fraud. Second, for vetting of advertisers, participating firms will adopt a risk-based approach to verify advertisers, while developing internal policies and tools to monitor the advertisements and contents on their platforms relating to financial products or services. Third, concerning removal of fraudulent advertisements, participating firms commit to enforcing their terms of service by detecting and removing financial scam advertisements or contents which violate platform policies. Fourth, for enhancing public awareness, participating firms will collaborate with financial regulators and the financial industry to launch various anti-scam campaigns to raise public vigilance against scams.

 The cross-sector collaboration enabled by Charter 3.0 will raise the barriers to execute scams, while helping the public better protect themselves against scams and reduce potential losses.

(3) Charter 3.0 covers major overseas and Mainland information technology platforms operating in Hong Kong, including instant messaging app, social media, video streaming and search engine, as well as nearly all major telecommunications service providers, including fixed network operators, mobile network operators and internet service providers. Given the diversity of platforms and services, participating firms will adopt proportionate measures based on their business scopes and models as appropriate, to implement the principles in Charter 3.0. This approach allows technology and telecommunications firms to leverage their tools and strengths to prevent scams and safeguard their users, and provide them with the flexibility to adapt to evolving tactics and patterns of scams, with a view to enhancing the capacity and effectiveness of Hong Kong's overall anti-scam ecosystem. The HKMA, together with other regulators, will maintain communication with participating firms to ensure effective measures are tailored to their service models and the latest scam tactics, thereby helping the public guard against scams.

 Combating financial scams requires collective efforts across different sectors of society. The Government will continue to implement multi-faceted measures and enhance cross-sector collaboration, so as to strengthen the security of Hong Kong's financial system while providing better protection for the public.

 Thank you, President."

（四）鑑於政府早前表示會進一步優化家族辦公室的優惠稅制，政府會否考慮擴大該優惠稅制的涵蓋範圍至聯合家族辦公室？

答覆：

主席：

家族辦公室業務是香港資產及財富管理業的重要一環。根據投資推廣署委聘的顧問所作研究，估計在二○二三年底約有2 700間單一家族辦公室在港營辦，預計很快增至3 000間。截至二○二四年年底，香港的私人銀行和私人財富管理業務中，來自家族辦公室和私人信託客戶的資產規模達15,510億港元，為資產及財富管理業和其他相關專業服務帶來龐大商機。就問題的各部分，經諮詢稅務局及投資推廣署後，現回覆如下。

（一）政府於二○二三年三月發表《有關香港發展家族辦公室業務的政策宣言》（《政策宣言》），提出八大措施，以締造具競爭力的有利環境，讓全球家族辦公室和資產擁有人的業務在香港蓬勃發展。作為其中一項支援措施，《2023年稅務（修訂）（家族投資控權工具的稅務寬減）條例》自二○二三年五月十九日起生效並適用於二○二二年四月一日或之後開始的課稅年度。由單一家族辦公室在香港管理，並符合2.4億港元的最低資產門檻及實質活動要求的家族投資控權工具（家控工具），其合資格交易可獲豁免繳付利得稅。

家族辦公室業界對《政策宣言》提出的措施，包括稅務優惠制度、「新資本投資者入境計劃」（「新計劃」）及香港財富傳承學院（財富傳承學院）的反應良好，而有興趣在港設立或擴展業務的家族辦公室數目亦有所上升。然而，由於稅務寬減制度仍屬起步階段，因此在二○二二／二三及二○二三／二四課稅年度申請稅務寬減的家控工具為數較少，而為免洩露納稅人的身分，相關數據並不宜公開。此外，由於業界需時調整營運模式以符合獲得稅務寬減的資格，現階段的申請數字未必適合作為反映稅務寬減制度成效的指標。

（二）及（三）政府積極推動家族辦公室的業務發展，增強香港資產及財富管理和相關專業界別的發展優勢，並一直與家族辦公室業界保持緊密溝通，了解家族辦公室的發展需要。投資推廣署的家族辦公室團隊（專責團隊）在二○二五年首五個月已協助50間家族辦公室在港設立或擴展業務，較去年同期上升百分之十九，另有約150間家族辦公室表示正準備或已決定在港設立或擴展業務。自專責團隊於二○二一年六月成立以來的相關數據表列如下：

經專責團隊與家族辦公室業界理解，有意或已在香港設立家族辦公室的人士普遍關注的範疇包括相關合規要求、稅務優惠及專業人才供應等。然而，專責團隊並沒有收集家族辦公室辦公空間的相關數據。一般而言，個別家族辦公室對其辦公空間的地點、私隱度、設施配套等有不同的要求，亦可能考慮營運成本及是否毗鄰專業服務機構等。

因應業界提出的意見，並為加強「新計劃」與在港設立家族辦公室兩者之間帶來協同效應，政府已於二○二五年三月一日起實施優化措施，包括容許申請人透過由《稅務條例》附表16E第2條所界定的具資格單一家族辦公室管理，並由申請人全資擁有的合資格私人公司進行「新計劃」下的投資並計入合資格投資金額內。

同時，政府致力壯大財富管理及家族辦公室人才庫，以滿足家族辦公室對專業人才的需求。我們自二○一六年起推行提升資產財富管理業人才培訓先導計劃，以培養更多業界人才。計劃至今有超過4 800宗合資格專業培訓課程的學費資助申請獲批，並為超過1 100名大專學生提供實習機會，支持業界提供更多專業培訓及學習機會，提升從業員的專業水平。此外，我們分別自二○一八年及二○二一年把「資產及財富管理專才」及「資產及財富管理合規專才」納入「人才清單」，以便利有關專業的優秀人才來港發展。政府亦於二○二三年成立財富傳承學院，以提供交流協作、知識分享和人才培訓的平台，並為資產擁有人和財富繼承者、家族辦公室業界提供相關培訓。

（四）政府已在二○二五至二六財政年度政府《財政預算案》公布進一步優化單一家族辦公室的優惠稅制的建議，包括增加單一家族辦公室享有稅務寬減的合資格交易種類，例如碳排放衍生工具／排放限額、保險相連證券、貸款及私募債權投資和數碼資產的交易等，以吸引更多家族辦公室來港落戶。政府已就優化優惠稅制的措施完成業界諮詢，並正就收集到的意見與金融監管機構商討相關優化措施。政府的目標是在今年內制訂具體方案，並於二○二六年把立法建議提交立法會審議。如獲通過，有關措施可於二○二五／二六課稅年度起生效。

現時的家族辦公室優惠稅制並不包括聯合家族辦公室所管理的家控工具，原因是聯合家族辦公室一般屬獨立的服務提供者，並非由有關家族所擁有。聯合家族辦公室或會為第三方提供投資管理服務或其他金融服務，實際上與銀行、私人銀行及資產及財富管理公司的業務無異。再者，如不同家族的家控工具由聯合家族辦公室管理，亦難以確定相關家控工具是否符合最低資產門檻和實質活動要求。我們須審慎研究將稅務優惠措施進一步擴大至聯合家族辦公室的實際效益及對財政的相關影響。

另一方面，如家控工具符合《稅務條例》下「基金」的定義並由證券及期貨事務監察委員會持牌機構（包括聯合家族辦公室）在香港進行或安排合資格交易，現已可循統一基金免稅制度就相關交易獲得稅務寬免。"

In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) for the two years of assessment 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, of the following information on the single family offices eligible for the profits tax concession under the Amendment Ordinance in each year: (i) the number, (ii) the average number of full-time employees, (iii) ‍the average operating expenditure, as well as (iv) the average amount and (v) the total amount of tax reduction received, and set out in the table below with a breakdown by the size of asset under management (AUM) (i.e. (a) $240 million to below $390 million, (b)‍ ‍$390 ‍million to below $780 million, and (c) $780 million or above);

(3) of the number of family offices that have been established in Hong Kong with the assistance or facilitation of the dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team of Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) since 2021, and the respective numbers of inquiries and follow-up cases handled; among these cases, of the common concerns of individuals who are interested in or have already established family offices in Hong Kong (set out by key areas of concern); and

(4) as the Government has earlier on indicated that it would further enhance the preferential tax regime for family offices, will the Government consider expanding the scope of the preferential tax regime to cover multi-family offices?

Reply:

President,

 Family office (FO) business is an important segment of the asset and wealth management (WAM) sector in Hong Kong. According to the research findings of the consultant commissioned by Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), there were around 2 700 single FOs operating in Hong Kong as of end-2023. The number is expected to exceed 3 000 in the near future. As of end-2024, the size of private banking and private wealth management business attributed to FOs and private trusts clients reached HK$1,551 billion, providing significant business opportunities for the WAM sector and other related professional services. In consultation with the Inland Revenue Department and InvestHK, the reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The Government issued the Policy Statement on Developing Family Office Businesses in Hong Kong in March 2023 to set out eight measures with a view to creating a conducive and competitive environment for the businesses of global FOs and asset owners to thrive in Hong Kong. As one of the support measures, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) (Tax Concessions for Family-owned Investment Holding Vehicles) Ordinance 2023 came into operation on May 19, 2023, and applies in respect of a year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2022. Family-owned investment holding vehicles (FIHVs) managed by single FOs in Hong Kong fulfilling the minimum asset threshold of HK$240 million and substantial activities requirement can enjoy profits tax exemption for qualifying transactions.

 The FO sector has responded positively to the measures set out in the Policy Statement, including the preferential tax regime, the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (New CIES) and the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy (HKAWL). The number of FOs interested in setting up or expanding their business in Hong Kong has also increased. That said, a relatively small number of applications for tax concession for FIHVs have been received in the years of assessment 2022/23 and 2023/24 as the tax concession regime is still at its early stage. In this light, it may not be appropriate to disclose relevant data to avoid disclosing the information of the taxpayers. Furthermore, since the industry needs time to adjust their operations in order to meet the eligibility requirements for tax concession, the current number of applications may not be an appropriate indicator of the effectiveness of the tax concession regime.

(2) and (3) The Government actively promotes the development of FO business and strengthens advantages in developing the WAM industry and related professional service sectors in Hong Kong. The Government has maintained close communication with the FO sector to understand the development needs of FOs. The dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team of InvestHK has already assisted 50 FOs to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong in the first five months of 2025, representing a 19 per cent increase compared with the same period last year. Separately, around 150 FOs have indicated that they are preparing or have decided to set up or expand their business in Hong Kong. The statistics since the establishment of the dedicated team in June 2021 are summarised as follows:

 For those who intend to or have set up FOs in Hong Kong, the dedicated team understands from the FO sector that their general areas of concern include compliance requirements, tax incentives and the availability of professionals, etc. However, the dedicated team does not maintain relevant statistics of the office space of FOs. Generally speaking, individual FOs have different requirements for the location, privacy and supporting facilities of their office space, and may also consider the operating costs and proximity to professional service firms, etc.

 In response to the industry's view and to enhance the synergy between the New CIES and the establishment of FOs in Hong Kong, the Government has implemented enhancement measures with effect from March 1, 2025, including allowing applicants to make investments under the New CIES through an eligible private company managed by an eligible single FO as defined in Section 2 of Schedule 16E to the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO) and wholly owned by the applicant. These investments can be counted towards the applicant's eligible investment.

 To meet the needs by FOs for professional talents, the Government is committed to expanding the talent pool in wealth management and FOs. We have since 2016 implemented the Pilot Programme to Enhance Talent Training for the Asset and Wealth Management Sector to nurture more industry talents. To date, over 4 800 applications for reimbursement of eligible professional training course fees have been approved, and the Programme has provided internship opportunities for over 1 100 tertiary students, supporting the industry to offer more professional training and learning opportunities, thereby enhancing the professional standards of practitioners. Besides, we have included ""management professionals in WAM"" and ""professionals in compliance in WAM"" under the Talent List since 2018 and 2021 respectively, so as to facilitate high-quality talents in these professions to pursue development in Hong Kong. The Government has also established the HKAWL in 2023 to provide a platform for collaboration, networking, knowledge sharing and talent development, and to provide relevant training for asset owners, wealth inheritors and the FO sector.

(4) The Government has announced in the 2025-26 Budget proposals to further enhance the preferential tax regime for single FOs, including increasing the types of qualifying transactions eligible for tax concessions for single FOs, such as transactions in emission derivatives/allowances, insurance-linked securities, loans and private credit investments, and digital assets, to attract more FOs to establish a presence in Hong Kong. The Government has completed the industry consultation on the enhancement measures on the preferential tax regimes, and is formulating the relevant enhancement measures in consultation with financial regulators based on the feedback received. The Government targets to work out the details by this year and submit the legislative proposals to the Legislative Council for consideration in 2026. If approved, the relevant measures will take effect from the year of assessment 2025/26.

 The current preferential tax regime for FOs does not cover FIHVs managed by multi-FOs as they are generally independent service providers which are not owned by the relevant families. Multi-FOs may engage in the provision of investment management services or other financial services for third parties, which are essentially no different from the business of banks, private banks and WAM companies. Furthermore, if FIHVs of different families are managed by multi-FOs, there may also be difficulties in ascertaining whether the minimum asset threshold and substantial activities requirement of the FIHVs concerned are met. We need to critically examine the actual effectiveness and related fiscal implications of further extending the tax incentives to multi-FOs.

 On the other hand, where an FIHV meets the definition of ""fund"" under the IRO and the qualifying transactions are carried out or arranged in Hong Kong by a licensed corporation of the Securities and Futures Commission (including multi-FOs), currently the relevant transactions are already eligible for tax exemption under the unified tax regime for funds."

Stall enhancement works to commence August 1 in Ap Lei Chau Market Cooked Food Centre and Luen Wo Hui Market Cooked Food Centre,2025-07-30 14:00,2025-07-30 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/30/P2025073000311.htm,"âA spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (July 30) that stall enhancement works in the Ap Lei Chau Market Cooked Food Centre and the Luen Wo Hui Market Cooked Food Centre will commence on August 1 (Friday) to improve their operating environments and enhance the dining experiences for the public. To facilitate the smooth implementation of the works, both cooked food centres will be temporarily closed with effect from the same date.

The stall enhancement works in the Ap Lei Chau Market Cooked Food Centre and the Luen Wo Hui Market Cooked Food Centre will mainly focus on upgrading the dining areas and stall portals, including beautifying or replacing ceilings, walls, floor tiles and lighting fixtures, as well as reconfiguring dining furniture, etc. The FEHD will also undertake other repair and maintenance works, including the replacement or repair of electrical and mechanical equipment and building services installations within the cooked food centres. The Ap Lei Chau Market Cooked Food Centre and the Luen Wo Hui Market Cooked Food Centre are expected to be completed by April and July next year respectively.

The Government has been implementing the Market Modernisation Programme (MMP) since 2018. Through overhaul or redevelopment projects, stall enhancement projects and minor refurbishment or improvement works, the MMP improves the operating environment of existing public markets, assists with tenants' business operations and provides a more pleasant shopping environment. The Queen Street Cooked Food Market was the first stall enhancement project under the MMP. The relevant works commenced in February 2024 and the Market resumed full operation in September of the same year. Following its reopening, the average daily footfall of the Queen Street Cooked Food Market has increased by over 10 per cent compared with that before the enhancement works. The Market has generally been operating smoothly and provides a modern and comfortable dining environment for the public. The FEHD will continue to take forward the MMP to implement projects of various scales at suitable markets, with a view to keeping public markets abreast with the times to meet public needs."
