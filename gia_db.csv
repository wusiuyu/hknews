食環署公布八月份第一批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數,2025-08-09 12:10,2025-08-09 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900279.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（八月九日）表示，為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署會加強白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數的資訊發放。

食環署早前已公布七月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，並正持續在不同監察地區展開八月份的蚊患調查。當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的地區誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊。

八月份第一批涵蓋13個監察區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數及密度指數如下：

屯門區掃管笏的指數達16.4%，食環署會按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），聯同有關部門及持份者攜手強化滅蚊工作，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

市民應採取以下措施，加強防範蚊子滋生：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除所有多餘積水，並消除滲漏源頭；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，清除盤栽墊碟裏的水；
蓋好所有盛水容器；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；及
鋪平或填補不平坦的地面及孔洞。


食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
FEHD releases first batch of gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus in August,2025-08-09 12:10,2025-08-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900280.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) announced today (August 9) that it will enhance the dissemination of gravidtrap index data to allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

The FEHD has previously announced the gravidtrap index data in July and is currently conducting mosquito infestation surveys in various survey areas for August. Once the surveys are completed in individual survey areas and the latest gravidtrap and density indices are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media.

The first batch of gravidtrap index and density index for August, covering 13 survey areas, is as follows:

The index in So Kwun Wat, Tuen Mun District, reached 16.4 per cent. In response to the recent CF situation, the FEHD has activated a mechanism that strengthen mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20% or above. The FEHD will collaborate with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation, and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

Members of public should adopt the following measures, strengthening the prevention against the breeding of mosquitoes:


Tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water in containers inside their premises;
Remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
Completely change the water in flower vases at least once a week and remove the water on the plant saucers;
Properly cover all containers that hold water;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers; and
Level irregular ground surfaces and holes.


Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
特區政府反對美國和七國集團快速反應機制成員國就特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的抹黑言論,2025-08-09 11:15,2025-08-09 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900285.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（八月九日）就美國、七國集團快速反應機制成員國（包括加拿大、法國、德國、意大利、日本、英國及歐盟）和關聯成員國就有關特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的不實和偏頗言論，表示強烈不滿和反對。

發言人指出：「《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》（《香港國安法》）和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威等自由。維護國家安全的法例只針對極少部分的危害國家安全的組織和個人。」

發言人亦指出：「警務處國家安全處已於七月二十五日公布懸紅通緝十六名潛逃者，以及已於二○二四年六月和十二月先後被指明為潛逃者的袁弓夷、霍嘉誌及蔡明達。這十九名潛逃者在境外籌組、成立或參與一個名為『香港議會』的顛覆組織，涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》罪行。法院已應警方的申請，就上述十九名在逃人士發出拘捕令。保安局局長亦已於八月四日行使《維護國家安全條例》所賦予的權力，藉在憲報刊登公告，指明上述十六名潛逃者，並指明針對這十六名有關潛逃者施行的措施。」

發言人表示：「該等潛藏境外的潛逃者被通緝和被法院發出拘捕令，並非因為他們『行使發表的自由』，而是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當。『香港議會』是一個旨在顛覆國家政權的組織，其目標包括推動『自決』、制定所謂『香港憲法』，以非法手段推翻、破壞《中華人民共和國憲法》所確立的中華人民共和國根本制度或推翻中華人民共和國中央政權機關或者特區政權機關等，因此有需要採取是次措施強烈打擊。」

「危害國家安全是非常嚴重的罪行，該類行為或活動可能造成極為嚴重的後果。特區政府有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》及其他危害國家安全罪行的人。任何外部勢力及別有用心人士，在特區政府提出相關措施後，詆毀盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區，實乃典型的虛偽『雙標』。」

「香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關的人或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與其政治立場、背景或職業無關。特區政府有責任依法追究涉嫌干犯危害國家安全罪行並潛逃海外的人。」

發言人強調：「潛逃者不要妄想潛逃離港就可以逃避刑責。他們最終都需要為其危害國家安全的嚴重犯罪行為負上責任，受到法律制裁。任何倡議某些人或組織不應就其違法行為承擔其法律後果，等同給予其犯法特權，這完全違反法治精神。」

發言人重申：「香港居民的人權和自由受《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實保障。任何外國或外部勢力企圖詆毀香港情況，只會理屈詞窮，絕不會得逞。特區政府定當繼續堅定履職，維護國家安全。」"

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-09 06:46,2025-08-09 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900004.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 9) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

InvestHK leads start-up delegation to Bangkok to attend Techsauce Global Summit 2025 and promote two-way investment (with photos),2025-08-08 22:57,2025-08-08 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800673.htm," StartmeupHK, an initiative by Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) dedicated to helping start-ups establish a presence in the city, concluded a successful business mission to the Techsauce Global Summit 2025, held from August 4 to 6 in Bangkok, Thailand.

 Led by InvestHK, the delegation of 16 start-ups fostered meaningful connections not only with Thai corporates, investors, and tech leaders, but also among themselves, highlighting opportunities for cross-border collaboration and reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a leading start-up hub.

 The Techsauce Global Summit, held annually in Bangkok, is Southeast Asia's premier technology event, uniting global tech leaders, start-ups, investors, and corporates. With a mission to position Thailand as the Digital Gateway of Southeast Asia, the summit fosters networking, knowledge exchanges, and business opportunities across diverse sectors.

 This year's event attracted thousands of participants from across Asia Pacific, creating a dynamic environment for collaboration and innovation. The delegation's visit included site visits to four major Thai companies, facilitating discussions on potential collaborations in areas such as financial technology (fintech), digital transformation, and smart city solutions.

 The Head of Investment Promotion, Bangkok, at InvestHK, Mr Panakorn Dejthumrongwat, said, ""The Techsauce Global Summit 2025 highlighted the energy and potential of Southeast Asia's start-up ecosystem. This mission was a valuable opportunity to showcase what Hong Kong offers Thai start-ups looking to scale up, while also helping Hong Kong companies connect with Thai corporates and partners. It reflects the two-way opportunities for collaboration and growth, with Hong Kong serving as both a springboard to global markets and a gateway for inbound innovation to Asia.""

Showcasing Hong Kong's start-up ecosystem

 Senior Vice President of Startups at InvestHK, Mr Chin Yung Lu joined the fireside chat ""Tech in Hong Kong, and to the World: A Market Expansion Guide"" at the summit, alongside Hong Kong fintech start-up WealthRyse's Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, Mr David Lee.

 They highlighted Hong Kong's strengths for Thai and Southeast Asian start-ups, including its open and business-friendly environment, strong common-law legal system, and proximity to Mainland China via the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area). The speakers also emphasised Hong Kong's role as a strategic launch pad for international expansion, with access to global funding, a deep talent pool and supportive government policies that foster entrepreneurship and cross-border growth.

Global Fast Track Thailand Regional Round 2025

 On August 5, the Global Fast Track Thailand Regional Round 2025 pitching session saw eight innovative start-ups take the stage to present their innovative solutions. Eazy Digital was selected as the winner for its AI-powered solutions that are reshaping the insurance and brokerage sectors.

 The company secured a coveted spot in the semi-finals of the Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025, to be held in November 2025 in Hong Kong, offering a platform to gain further exposure and investment opportunities.

Hong Kong business mission: engaging Thai corporates and start-ups

 On August 6, the delegation visited four leading Thai corporates and venture capital firms, with a focus on proptech collaboration. The meetings with Magnolia Quality Development Corporation Limited, ECG Ventures, All Seasons Property, and Asset World Corporation offered in-depth insights into each company's vision and business operations, while also highlighting potential avenues for engagement and collaboration with start-ups in their respective sectors.

 Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Inspekly, Mr Steven Cheng said, ""The mission to Bangkok, hosted by InvestHK, was a valuable stepping stone into a new market. It gave us the rare opportunity to connect directly with leading real estate developers in Bangkok - an experience many businesses aspire to. We're grateful for the exposure and meaningful connections made possible through this mission.""

 Co-founder of Green Vigor Limited, Ms Penney Chong commented, ""This was a unique opportunity to showcase our green tech to Thai real estate leaders and investors. It helped us raise international visibility and build connections that will support our future growth in the region.""

 The Business Development/Sales Lead - South East Asia of Carnot Innovations Limited, Mr TS Velan, added, ""It was an awesome Thailand business mission. Direct C-suite connections in Thailand gave a good head start for growth start-ups like us who are expanding in the Thai market and the region.""

 The StartmeupHK delegation to Techsauce Global Summit 2025 underscores Hong Kong's commitment to fostering two-way innovation and collaboration with Southeast Asia. Hong Kong's start-up landscape has exhibited remarkable growth, continuing its upward trend from 2024.

 Despite external challenges, the findings from InvestHK's 2024 Startup Survey revealed that the total number of start-ups has surged to 4,694, employing 17,651 individuals - a record high that underscores the ecosystem's vitality.

 The encouraging results reflect Hong Kong's allure for start-up founders, bolstered by several key advantages. Hong Kong offers a simple tax system with a low tax rate, provides excellent accessibility to funding and access to the vast Mainland China market, particularly through Hong Kong's role as a gateway to the Greater Bay Area.

 By leveraging its position as a global financial hub, a gateway to the Greater Bay Area, and a nurturing environment for start-ups, Hong Kong continues to attract and empower entrepreneurs to achieve global success."
CHP investigates one new case and one probable case of chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-08-08 21:40,2025-08-08 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800846.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 8) announced that one new imported case and one probable case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded, as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the recent CF cases. The CHP reminded members of the public to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

The confirmed imported case involved a 66-year-old female with underlying illnesses, living in Kwai Tsing District. Initial investigations revealed that the patient travelled alone to Foshan in Guangdong Province between July 24 and August 5, but did not recall a history of mosquito bites during the stay. She developed fever, rash and joint pain since August 6. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital yesterday (August 7) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. She is currently in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for CF virus upon laboratory testing.

Since the patient stayed in Foshan during the whole incubation period, the CHP considered that the patient was infected during travel, and the case was classified as an imported case. She has no travel collaterals, and her household contacts are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance. The CHP's epidemiological investigations is ongoing and has reported the case to the health authorities of Guangdong.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the above patient, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspection of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


Another probable case involves a 22-year-old female with good past health. She lives in Eastern District. Initial investigations revealed that she travelled oversea between July 16 and August 4 (July 16 to 28: Madagascar; July 28 to August 3: Mauritius; August 3 to 4: Malaysia), then arrived Hong Kong on August 4. She recalled a history of mosquito bites during the stay in Madagascar. She developed fever, headache and multiple joint pain in Madagascar since July 25 and rash over four limbs since July 30. Her fever had subsided before returning to Hong Kong. After returning to Hong Kong, she sought medical attention due to joint pain at the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on August 4 and was admitted for treatment on the following day (August 5). She was discharged on August 7.

The patient's blood sample collected on August 4 tested negative in nucleic acid testing, while the blood sample collected on August 5 tested positive today for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to CF virus. The case is likely a recovered case. The CHP considered that the patient was no longer infectious to mosquito upon her return to Hong Kong. The CHP will arrange for a blood sample to be collected from the patient next week for a second antibody testing. If there is a more than four-fold increase in the antibody titre against the CF virus when compared with the first specimen, the case will be classified as a confirmed case.

A total of five CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases, and another probable case has been recorded. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal.

The DH has enhanced publicity and education efforts regarding CF targeting different groups. The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, and also distributes leaflets to travellers.The Port Health Division staff members has recently reminded MTR Corporation, cross-boundary coach and ferry companies operators and the Airport Authority Hong Kong to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness of the elderly on preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, and reminding residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service has promoted information of CF prevention at more than 300 health promotion activities provided to the elderly and their carers. In addition, the Elderly Health Service has arranged for the distribution of relevant leaflets at Elderly Health Centres across the 18 districts, with a view to helping the elderly to learn about the symptoms of CF and enhance their awareness of prevention of CF. The Family Health Service has also advised pregnant women and infant carers at its Maternal and Child Health Centres about precautions for preventing CF. The Student Health Service will distribute promotional leaflets to students at its Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres so that students could learn more about symptoms of CF.

The Health Promotion Branch is committed to disseminating health information on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases (including CF) to the public through multiple channels. Measures include setting up Info Stations across various districts in Hong Kong (www.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html) and distributing relevant health messages through different online and offline platforms, with content updated as appropriate in light of the latest developments. To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into ten ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHP website. The Health Promotion Branch has also contacted stakeholders serving ethnic minority groups (such as non-governmental organisations and religious groups etc.) to distribute relevant health materials, so that more members of the public can access anti-mosquito information and work together to prevent the spread of CF.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and alsoMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

衞生防護中心調查一宗新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案及一宗可能個案（附圖）,2025-08-08 20:30,2025-08-08 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800806.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月八日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，錄得一宗新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，以及一宗可能個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。中心提醒市民，不論在本地或外遊，應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

確診輸入個案涉及一名有長期病患的66歲女子，居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於七月二十四日至八月五日，獨自到廣東省佛山市探親，但未能記起曾否被蚊叮。她於八月六日起出現發燒、皮疹及關節痛，並於昨日（八月七日）到仁濟醫院急症室求診，同日入院並在無蚊環境下接受治療，現時情況穩定。她的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於病人整個潛伏期在佛山市逗留，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人沒有其他同行人士，她的家居接觸者現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。中心正繼續流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於上述病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪的地點，加強防蚊滅蚊工作，包括：

在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


另一宗可能個案涉及一名過往健康良好的22歲女子，居於東區。初步調查顯示，她於七月十六日至八月四日外遊（七月十六日至二十八日：馬達加斯加；七月二十八日至八月三日：毛里求斯；八月三日至四：馬來西亞），並於八月四日返抵香港。她報稱在馬達加斯加旅遊期間曾被蚊叮咬，自七月二十五日起在馬達加斯加出現發燒、頭痛及多處關節痛，於七月三十日起四肢出疹，她回港前已經退燒。她回港後，因關節痛於八月四日到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院急症室求診，於翌日（八月五日）入院接受治療，並於八月七日出院。

病人於八月四日採集的血液樣本對核酸檢測呈陰性反應，而於八月五日採集的血液樣本經檢驗後，今日證實對基孔肯亞熱病毒免疫球蛋白M（IgM）抗體呈陽性反應，顯示個案可能屬於已康復個案。中心認為病人在返港時已對蚊子不具傳染性。中心會安排病人於下周再抽取血液樣本作第二次抗體檢驗，如樣本中基孔肯亞熱病毒的抗體滴度比第一次的樣本高出超過四倍，可視為確診個案。

本港今年累計錄得五宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案；以及一宗可能個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

根據世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。截至今年七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗個案，當中約90宗為死亡個案。

衞生署已加強對不同群組有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作。中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並向旅客派發宣傳單張。港口衞生科人員近日亦已提醒港鐵公司、跨境巴士和客輪公司營辦商及機場管理局等加強防控蚊患措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。長者健康外展分隊已透過超過300個為長者及照顧者提供的健康推廣活動推廣預防基孔肯雅熱的資訊。此外，長者健康服務亦安排在十八區的長者健康中心派發相關的單張，讓長者了解其症狀及加強防患基孔肯雅熱的意識。家庭健康服務亦在轄下的母嬰健康院提醒孕婦及嬰幼兒照顧者有關預防基孔肯雅熱的注意事項。學生健康服務會在轄下的學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心向學生派發宣傳單張，讓他們了解基孔肯雅熱的症狀。

FEHD enhances promulgation of gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and strengthens mosquito prevention and control measures,2025-08-08 20:15,2025-08-08 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800808.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (August 8) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in July was 8.1 per cent, at Level 2, which is lower than the 9.5 per cent in June, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was fairly extensive. Relevant government departments have persistently intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations, resulting in the improvement of overall condition of mosquito infestation this month. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the dissemination of information on gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes so that more citizens can quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation. The department will also further strengthen its mosquito control work to reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF).

In July, among the 64 survey areas, only the area gravidtrap index (AGI) of Ma Wan exceeded the alert level of 20 per cent, decreased from two survey areas in June. The relevant gravidtraps in the district concerned were mostly located in sports facilities and public places, and the FEHD has collaborated with other government departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito prevention and elimination work within 100-metre radius of the positive gravidtraps. The decreases in the monthly gravidtrap index and the number of areas with an AGI exceeding the alert level in July are attributable to the continuous and intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations by various government departments and stakeholders, and may also have been affected by factors like weather. The monthly rainfall was 601.7 millimetres in July, showing a significant increase from the 23.73 millimetres in June.

Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in July was 1.2, which represented that an average of 1.2 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas.

The FEHD has all along been regularly announcing the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD will strengthen the dissemination of information by early announcement of the latest gravidtrap index through press releases and social media platforms.

âIn addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of CF, the FEHD will extend the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI fall between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks, and in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify the nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

Since last month, the FEHD has stepped up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts to reduce the risk of transmission of CF and other mosquito-borne diseases. Following the recent imported CF cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within 250-metre radius of the residence of the patients and the places they had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding ground, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the AGI and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html)."
CHP investigates cluster of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae carrier cases,2025-08-08 20:04,2025-08-08 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800807.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (August 8) investigating a cluster of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) carrier cases involving five residents of a residential care home for the elderly (RCHE), and reminded all RCHEs to follow theGuidelines on Prevention of Communicable Diseasesin RCHE(the Guidelines) to implement measures for the detection, prevention and control of infectious diseases.

The CHP earlier received notification from the Hospital Authority (HA) that five female residents aged 68 to 93 of an RCHE in Chai Wan who attended public hospitals for underlying illnesses, had samples tested positive for CPE upon laboratory tests. All of them carry the bacteria without symptoms of infection. The CHP immediately carried out epidemiological investigations after receiving notifications from the HA. It is found that the CPE might be transmitted within the institution. The CHP is conducting screening at the RCHE concerned to identify other possible carriers.

The CHP conducted a site inspection and found that the RCHE concerned had not fully implemented the related infection control measures. The CHP advised the RCHE to implement the necessary infection control measures to further prevent transmission of the resistant bacteria within the institution, including appropriate nursing procedures, thorough environmental cleaning and disinfection, proper hand hygiene for staff and residents.

The CHP will continue to put the RCHE under medical surveillance and investigate the cluster.

Enterobacteriaceae (for example, Escherichia coli andKlebsiella) are common pathogens that can cause infections at different body sites including urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections or bacteraemia. CPE are enterobacteriaceae that produce carbapenemase- an enzyme that can deactivate carbapenems and other beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins. These bacteria are commonly resistant to multiple antibiotics, limiting therapeutic options, and may render severe clinical infections difficult to treat. The range of diseases associated with CPE varies from asymptomatic carriage to potentially life-threatening or fatal infections. The level of risk depends on which part of the body is affected by the infection and the general health of the patient.

ââProper use of antibiotics and maintaining good personal and environmental hygiene, especially hand hygiene, are important for the prevention of emergence and cross-transmission of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) like CPE. In addition, susceptible individuals such as the elderly, infants and young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immunity can lower the risk of contracting MDROs by not eating raw or undercooked foods."

衞生防護中心調查一宗產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌帶菌個案群組,2025-08-08 19:18,2025-08-08 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800752.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月八日）正調查一宗產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌帶菌個案群組，涉及一所安老院的五名院友，並提醒院舍應按照「安老院舍預防傳染病指引」執行傳染病檢測、預防和控制措施。

中心早前接獲醫院管理局（醫管局）通知，五名年齡介乎68至93歲、居於柴灣一間安老院舍的女院友，因自身疾病先後到公立醫院求診，她們的樣本經化驗後，確診帶有產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌。他們全部屬帶菌者，並沒有出現相關感染病徵。中心接獲醫管局通知後，隨即展開流行病學調查，發現該耐藥性細菌可能於院舍內傳播。中心正在院舍為接觸者進行篩查，以找出其他可能帶菌者。

中心人員已實地巡查涉事院舍，發現該院舍未有全面執行相關的感染控制措施。中心已建議院舍採取所需控制措施以預防耐藥性細菌在院內傳播，包括妥善護理程序、徹底清潔及消毒環境、員工和院友保持良好的手部衞生。

中心會繼續對該院舍進行醫學監察，亦會繼續調查個案群組。

腸道桿菌（例如大腸桿菌和克雷伯桿菌）是常見的病原體，能引致身體不同部位的感染，包括尿道炎、腹腔內部感染和菌血病。產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌產生的碳青霉烯酶酵素，可令碳青霉烯和其他β-內酰胺（如青霉素）抗生素失效。這些細菌通常對多種抗生素具有抗藥性，限制了治療的選擇，或從而導致難以治療的嚴重感染。這類細菌的帶菌者可以毫無病徵，但細菌也可引致嚴重甚至致命的感染。風險程度取決於受感染的部位和患者的健康狀況。

正確使用抗生素及注意個人和環境衞生，尤其是手部衞生，對預防多重抗藥性細菌如產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌的出現和交叉傳播至為重要。此外，老幼病孕等高危人士避免進食生或未煮熟食物，可減低感染多重抗藥性細菌的風險。"

另外，七月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點二，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一點二隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署將加強資訊發放，會通過新聞公布及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署會將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

食環署自上月起已在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，以降低基孔肯雅熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險。因應日前出現的基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，食環署已即時在病者的住所，及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
登革熱最新情況,2025-08-08 18:15,2025-08-08 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800694.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月八日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字。中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，由於在夏季期間氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況可能會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往登革熱流行地區，因此本地登革熱的風險正在上升。

由八月一日至昨日（八月七日），中心錄得三宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾到柬埔寨、菲律賓及泰國。

截至昨日，今年錄得39宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過二萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得465宗本地感染病例，於七月二十八日至八月三日的一周內已錄得157宗，其中以廣州、雲浮、中山和佛山錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

歐家榮醫生補充：「本港經常有外地傳入的登革熱個案，每年間中亦有零星的本地登革熱個案。由於香港存在白紋伊蚊，本地市民有機會受感染。炎熱多雨的季節有利蚊子迅速繁殖。如控蚊成效不足，更有爆發登革熱的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防登革熱的最佳方法。市民如從受登革熱影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

市民應繼續採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


​含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務登革熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁及YouTube頻道。"
Update on dengue fever,2025-08-08 18:15,2025-08-08 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800696.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 8) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases. The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded the public that due to the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, mosquito infestation might be aggravated in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public will travel to DF-endemic regions more frequently during the summer holiday. Therefore, the risk of DF in Hong Kong is increasing.

  From August 1 to yesterday (August 7), the CHP recorded three imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to Cambodia, the Philippines and Thailand during the incubation periods respectively.

As of yesterday, 39 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 465 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 157 cases were recorded in the week between July 28 and August 3, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Yunfu, Zhongshan and Foshan.

Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

  ""There have been frequent imported cases of dengue fever in Hong Kong, as well as occasional sporadic local cases every year. The presence of Aedes albopictus in Hong Kong makes our population vulnerable. Mosquitoes breed quickly during the hot and rainy summer months. There are risks of DF outbreaks if mosquito control is inadequate. Hence, mosquito control is of paramount importance. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. The public is reminded that eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are key to preventing DF. Those returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor,"" Dr Au added.

  Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.


âDEET-containing insect repellents are effective and the public should take heed of the tips below:


Read the label instructions carefully first;
Apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
Apply on exposed skin and clothing;
Use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
Apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
In addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."
SCS encourages non-ethnic Chinese interns to better equip themselves (with photos),2025-08-08 18:05,2025-08-08 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800486.htm,"  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, attended a sharing session on the Internship Programme for Non-ethnic Chinese (NEC) Students today (August 8). At the gathering, she listened to the students share their internship experiences and encouraged them to better equip themselves in preparation for their future career planning.

  Mrs Yeung was pleased to learn that the students had gained a deeper understanding of the work of the civil service through their internships in different bureaux and departments. She said, ""The Government attaches great importance to attracting talent from different backgrounds to join the civil service and building a diversified pool of talent to enhance the quality and efficiency of public service. In the recruitment process, all candidates are assessed on the basis of their ability, performance and character. Race is not, and has never been, a relevant consideration.""

  To encourage NEC interns to join the Government, the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) invited two NEC civil servants, Administrative Officer Mr Gurung Marco Ben and Executive Officer Ms Kaur Gurinder Deep, Diya, to share their experiences and preparation for applying for civil service jobs, as well as their daily work experiences. Born and raised in Hong Kong, both of them possess biliterate and trilingual abilities and were appointed as civil servants through the open recruitment process.

  Mrs Yeung added, ""We are glad to see more and more NECs joining the civil service and contributing to the development and prosperity of Hong Kong. We look forward to more promising young people joining the civil service and encourage them to equip themselves earlier to take on challenges.""

  The CSB has been organising the Internship Programme for NEC Students since 2019 with a view to helping young NECs accumulate work experience and strengthen their competitiveness in seeking jobs and deepening their understanding of the operation of the Government through the internship experience. Since the launch of the internship programme, more than 220 NEC students have participated in the programme, including the 44 students who joined this year, which marks a record high. The students were arranged to undertake internships in various bureaux and departments for about eight weeks and were provided with online basic workplace Chinese language self-learning resources to strengthen their Chinese learning.

  Mr Sheik Mahmood Afif, a university student studying computer engineering, participated in the internship programme this year. He assisted with the daily operations of the Smart Government Innovation Lab at the Digital Policy Office, including developing AI analysis tools. He believes the internship is highly relevant to his studies, allowing him to apply his knowledge to his work and strengthening his interest in pursuing a career in a technology-related field.

  Another intern, Miss Lama Sujata, was posted to the Festivals Office of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to provide back-end support for programme preparation. She took part in designing promotional materials, hospitality for artists, liaising with venue management, and more. She said that the internship experience has enabled her to familiarise herself with the application of design and image processing software and enhanced her knowledge of event planning, which will greatly help her future career.

  Miss Narag Kezra Leigh, a social work student, has just finished her internship at the Youth Employment Division of the Labour Department, where she assisted in promoting the Youth Employment Start, the department's youth employment resource centre. She provided support to social workers in giving talks at secondary schools and organising activities at the centre. The internship experience allowed her to better understand the employment services provided by the Government to the public, in particular for young people, and improved her interpersonal skills through interactions with service users."

楊何蓓茵欣悉同學們透過在不同政策局和部門實習，對公務員工作有更深入認識。她說：「政府十分重視吸引不同背景的人才加入公務員團隊，建立多元人才庫，提升公共服務的質素和效率。政府招聘時會按申請人的能力、表現和品格進行評核，種族從來不是考慮因素。」

為了鼓勵非華裔實習生加入政府，公務員事務局邀請兩位非華裔公務員，政務主任馬仕高和行政主任古狄雅現身說法，與實習生分享投考公務員的心得和準備工作，以及日常工作的見聞。他們均是在香港土生土長，能操兩文三語，通過公開招聘程序獲聘。

楊何蓓茵說：「我們樂見越來越多非華裔人士加入公務員的大家庭，為香港的發展和繁榮作出貢獻。我們期待更多青年人才加入公務員隊伍，並鼓勵他們盡早裝備自己，為迎接未來挑戰做好準備。」

公務員事務局自二○一九年起推出為非華裔大學生而設的政府部門實習計劃，協助年輕非華裔人士累積工作經驗和提升就業競爭力，並希望實習經驗能加深他們對政府運作的認識。實習計劃推行至今已有超過220名非華裔學生參與，包括今年參與計劃的44名學生，人數為歷年來最多。他們獲安排到不同政策局和部門進行約八星期的實習，而政府也會為他們提供網上基本職場中文自學資源，鼓勵他們學習中文。

正在大學修讀計算機工程的Sheik Mahmood Afif參加了今年的實習計劃，在數字政策辦公室協助智慧政府創新實驗室的日常運作，包括編寫電腦程式用於分析已收集的人工智能方案。他認為，實習範疇與所學息息相關，使他能學以致用之餘，亦加強他在科技相關行業發展的意向。

另一名實習生Lama Sujata獲派到康樂及文化事務署藝術節辦事處實習，支援節目籌備的後勤工作，其間參與宣傳品設計、藝人接待及場地協調等。實習經驗讓她熟習設計及影像處理軟件的應用，同時增加她對活動策劃的認識，對未來投身職場有很大幫助。

社會工作系學生Narag Kezra Leigh剛完成於勞工處青年就業科的實習，協助推廣部門轄下的青年就業資源中心「青年就業起點」的服務，包括協助社工到不同中學進行講座和籌辦中心活動。她說這次實習經驗讓她更了解政府向公眾，尤其是為青年提供的就業服務，與服務使用者交流亦讓她的人際溝通能力有所提升。"

21名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-08-08 16:43,2025-08-08 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800601.htm,"21名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於八月一日及今日（八月八日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款共88,100元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 143宗個案，而就法庭已處理的803宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及696名分間單位業主，罰款介乎400元至41,600元，合計總罰款共2,104,910元，另有340宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該21名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；（二）要求租客付還經分攤的水及／或電費時沒有出示繳費單副本及提供書面帳目；及（三）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。其中一名業主觸犯上述（一）項共16宗罪行而被判處罰款16,000元。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

如就規管租賃事宜有疑問，可致電電話熱線（2150 8303）或瀏覽估價署網頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/our_services/part_iva.html）內的相關資訊。"
21 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-08-08 16:43,2025-08-08 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800609.htm,"  Twenty-one landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7), pleaded guilty and were fined a total of $88,100 on August 1 and today (August 8) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 143 cases to date. Among the 803 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 696 SDU landlords with fines ranging from $400 to $41,600, amounting to a total of $2,104,910. In addition, 340 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 21 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; (2) failing to produce copies of the bills and provide an account in writing when requiring the tenant to pay for the reimbursement of the apportioned water and/or electricity charges; and (3) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance). One of the landlords committed 16 offences under (1) and was fined $16,000.

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon an in-depth investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to facilitate SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."

A male passenger, aged 20, arrived in Hong Kong from Lisbon, Portugal, via Paris, France, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the suspected cocaine, camouflaged as a cheese wheel and weighing about 7.7kg, in his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (August 9).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

  Compared with the grading released last week, Silverstrand Beach has been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1 and Casam Beach from Grade 3 to Grade 2. Hoi Mei Wan Beach has been changed from Grade 2 to Grade 3.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

財經事務及庫務局局長在浦銀環球財富管理平台啓動儀式致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-08 15:20,2025-08-08 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800323.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（八月八日）在浦銀環球財富管理平台啓動儀式的致辭全文：

賈紅睿行長（上海浦東發展銀行（浦發銀行）香港分行行長、浦銀國際執行董事）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。今天，我非常榮幸受邀參加浦銀環球財富管理平台啓動儀式，並為大家致辭。我謹祝賀浦發銀行，期望您們不斷優化平台服務，貢獻香港資產及財富管理業的發展。

特區政府發展資產及財富管理業的策略有三大重點，包括（一）不斷做大資產管理規模，為香港在各項國際研究中「拼排名」；（二）加強與內地及粵港澳大灣區合作，擴大香港市場覆蓋面；及（三）通過政策及項目創新提升市場競爭力。

憑藉健全的監管框架、創新的金融政策以及廣泛的全球金融網絡，香港作為國際金融中心的地位始終穩固。通過政府與業界共同努力，我們做大資產管理規模「拼排名」的工作已經取得實際成果。截至二○二四年年底，香港的資產及財富管理業務總值超過35萬億元，按年增長百分之十三，淨資金流入更急升百分之八十一。私人銀行及私人財富管理業務的增長特別亮麗，管理資產按年增長百分之十五至10.4萬億元。今年六月，香港的私募基金管理資本額已突破2,374億美元，在亞洲排名第二，僅次於內地。

此外，根據最新的《全球金融中心指數》報告，香港在「投資管理」及「融資」領域位列全球第一，充分展現其作為國際投資者首選的亞洲財富管理中心地位。依據行業統計，香港同時也是亞洲最大的對沖基金中心，並預計在未來數年內成為全球最大的跨境財富管理中心。在大家的共同努力下，我熱切期待這天的到來。

要保持業務持續增長的動力，加強與內地及粵港澳大灣區合作，擴大香港市場覆蓋面至關重要。《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》明確支持香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐、國際資產管理中心及風險管理中心的地位，並致力打造大灣區綠色金融中心以及服務「一帶一路」建設的投融資平台。在跨境金融服務方面，香港已取得顯著成果，其中包括跨境開戶服務及跨境理財通的發展等。

截至今年六月，香港銀行提供超過360個見證開戶服務網點，協助香港居民開設逾43萬個內地銀行賬戶。我們將持續推動進展，適時與內地監管當局探討增加參與銀行的可能性。

此外，跨境理財通（粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通）允許香港、澳門及廣東省內九市居民跨境投資大灣區內的理財產品。我們將持續優化相關措施，豐富投資選擇，促進三地金融市場的互聯互通，協助業界拓展商機，充分發揮跨境理財通的潛力，並鞏固香港作為國際資產管理中心的地位。截至今年六月，參與跨境理財通的個人投資者已超過16萬人，跨境匯劃金額突破1,100億元人民幣。

在「一國兩制」的框架下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，結合成熟的金融基建和自由流通的資本，成為財富擁有人尋求投資機遇的首選地點。作為全球最大的離岸人民幣業務中心，香港的互聯互通機制助力全球投資者通過香港投資內地市場。未來我們將通過各項政策及項目創新，不斷提升市場競爭力。

在銷售網絡及渠道方面，香港已經與內地及其他市場達成基金互認安排，共有81個基金獲兩地監管機構認可，累計淨認購額超過1,200億元人民幣。與此同時，內地與香港基金互認安排獲進一步優化，包括放寬互認基金客地銷售比例限制，並允許香港互認基金將投資管理職能轉授予與管理人同集團的海外資產管理機構，顯著提升基金產品的多樣性及銷售規模。

家族辦公室業務方面，我們的目標是於今年年底前，協助不少於200間家族辦公室在港設立或擴展業務，構建全球家族辦公室和資產擁有人的蓬勃生態圈。根據目前進度，我們不單會達到目標，更將會超額完成。

去年我們與彭博（彭博有限合夥企業）合作推出「香港家辦匯」計劃，聚焦四大範疇，即家族辦公室生態圈建設、行業知識分享、資訊科技支持以及慈善倡議。此外，我們今年三月舉辦了第三屆「裕澤香江」高峰論壇，以「香港——為全球，向世界」為主題，匯聚全球精英，彰顯香港作為環球家族辦公室樞紐的獨特魅力。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，香港憑藉其獨特優勢、戰略地位、穩健的金融生態系統以及全球連繫，持續鞏固其國際金融中心的領先地位。浦銀環球財富管理平台的啓動，是充分運用這些優勢、提供創新財富管理解決方案的重要一步。我衷心祝願浦發銀行此項目取得圓滿成功，並期待見證這一平台為香港乃至全球金融服務作出卓越貢獻。謝謝大家！"
New arrangement on queue ticketing for direct issue of Hong Kong Full Driving Licence/Temporary Driving Licence from August 13,2025-08-08 15:15,2025-08-08 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800518.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (August 8) that new queue ticketing requirements will be imposed on agents submitting applications for the direct issue of Hong Kong Full Driving Licence/Temporary Driving Licence at the Hong Kong Licensing Office (HKLO) at United Centre, Admiralty, starting from August 13, ensuring fair use by the public.

  Currently, applicants for ""direct issue"" may submit application documents at the counter via making online appointments or obtaining same-day queue tickets at the HKLO. To combat soliciting activities for agent services and disruption of public order after obtaining queue tickets, from August 13, apart from inputting the first four digits/letters of their identification document (ID) number (e.g. K123) into the queue ticketing system, all agents appointed to submit ""direct issue"" applications are also required to input the ID number of each of the respective applicants when obtaining a ticket. Such information will be printed on the ticket. When using counter services, counter staff will verify the ID numbers of both the ticket holder and the applicant(s) entered. If any information does not match that printed on the ticket, the ticket will be voided. All applications concerned will not be processed, and no replacement tickets will be issued.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""We have been very concerned about the queue ticketing situation at Licensing Offices and online appointments for counter services, and have adopted targeted measures to ensure licensing services are used by members of the public in need in a fair and orderly manner. The HKLO has further stepped up staff patrols to maintain the queuing order, specified the sequence of tickets for 'direct issue' on the queue barriers to prevent queue-jumping, and enhanced the queue ticketing system to strengthen verification of queuers' identity to curb the transfer of tickets. The new arrangement aims to further deter individuals from soliciting business with tickets obtained. Any acts disrupting public order will be reported to the Police for follow-up.""

  In addition, the TD will strengthen co-operation with relevant issuing authorities of driving licences and plans to check applicants' information in relation to Mainland driving licences provided via online appointments starting from September. If any information is found to be untrue, the relevant appointments will be cancelled, and such quotas will be reopened for appointment by other applicants, thereby enhancing the effective operation of the system.

  The TD will introduce the new arrangement to the public through on-site notices and staff, the website and social media, keep reviewing the effectiveness of the measures, and make timely adjustments. It will continue to promote digitalisation of licensing services so that more counters can be redeployed for processing applications necessitating handling at the counter, such as the ""direct issue"". As for general driving licensing-related counter services, their queue ticketing arrangements remain unchanged."
​男子因進口未完稅香煙及利用經更改車輛為走私用途罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-08-08 15:06,2025-08-08 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800338.htm,"一名三十二歲男子因進口未完稅香煙及利用經更改車輛為走私用途，違反《應課稅品條例》和《進出口條例》，八月六日在西九龍裁判法院被判罪成，兩項控罪各被判監禁四個月，同期執行。

香港海關透過風險評估及情報分析，於二○二四年六月十二日，在港珠澳大橋香港口岸截查一輛報稱空載的入境私家車。經查檢後，海關人員在私家車的車門、中控台、車尾及車底加裝的暗格內共檢獲三萬零八百支未完稅香煙，遂拘捕該名男司機。涉案私家車亦被檢取。案中檢獲的香煙，估計市值約十八萬元，應課稅值約十萬元。

海關歡迎裁決，認為監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬及監禁兩年。

此外，走私屬嚴重罪行，根據《進出口條例》，任何人為走私用途而更改車輛，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

海關會繼續嚴厲執法，打撃跨境走私活動。

市民如發現懷疑私煙活動，可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報。"
Man convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and making use of altered structure of vehicle for purpose of smuggling articles (with photos),2025-08-08 15:06,2025-08-08 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800339.htm,"A 32-year-old man was convicted at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on August 6 for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and making use of an altered structure of a vehicle for the purpose of smuggling articles, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO). He was sentenced to four months' imprisonment for each of the charges that will run concurrently.

Through risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Hong Kong Customs intercepted an inbound private car, declared to be empty, at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port on June 12, 2024. Upon inspection, Customs officers seized a total of 30 800 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes from the doors, console box, the rear and a compartment installed underneath the vehicle. The male driver was subsequently arrested and the private car was also seized. The estimated market value of the cigarettes seized in the case was about $180,000 and the duty potential was about $100,000.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Moreover, smuggling is a serious offence. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of making use of the altered structure of a vehicle for the purpose of smuggling articles is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Customs will continue to combat cross-boundary smuggling activities with firm enforcement action.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

現時，免試簽發申請人可經網上預約或在香港牌照事務處領取即日籌，經櫃位遞交申請文件。針對部分人士在領取即日籌後招攬代辦服務並影響現場秩序，由八月十三日起，所有獲委託遞交申請的代辦在領取即日籌時，除須於系統輸入其個人身分證明文件號碼首四位數字或字母（如K123）外，亦須同時輸入各名免試簽發申請人的身分證明文件號碼首四位數字或字母，有關資料會列印於其籌號。當使用櫃位服務時，櫃位人員會核對籌號持有人及申請人身分證明文件號碼。如任何資料與籌號所印不符，該籌即告無效，所有申請一概不獲受理，亦不會補發籌號。

運輸署發言人說：「我們一直非常關注牌照事務處輪候取籌及網上預約櫃位服務的情況，並採取針對性的措施確保有需要市民公平和有序地使用牌證服務。香港牌照事務處已派員加強巡查維持輪候取籌的秩序，並於圍欄上標示輪候籌號次序以防止插隊，並提升派籌系統以加強核對身分阻截籌號轉讓。新安排旨在再進一步遏止憑籌號招攬生意的情況。如發現有人影響公共秩序，會交警方跟進。」

此外，署方將與有關駕駛執照簽發機構加強合作，包括計劃由九月起查核經網上預約提供的內地駕駛證的申請人資料。如發現資料不真確，有關預約將會取消，名額會重新開放予其他申請人預約，提升系統有效運作。

署方會透過現場告示和人員、網頁、社交媒體等向市民簡介新安排，並持續檢視措施的成效，適時調整；同時繼續推動牌證服務電子化，從而調動更多櫃位辦理如免試簽發等必須經櫃位處理的申請。至於一般駕駛執照相關櫃位服務，取籌和輪候安排維持不變。"
