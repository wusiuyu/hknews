Remarks by SFST at 19th Asian Financial Forum media session,2026-01-26 13:04,2026-01-26 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600361.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at a media session whilst attending 19th Asian Financial Forum this morning (January 26):

Reporter: You have mentioned about keeping the communication with the Chinese Mainland IPOs. What concrete measures are being prioritised to ensure robust and sustained trading activity for new listings companies in Hong Kong, and how to make sure their quality?

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: I think one of the key things that we have tried to do is to ensure the continued quality of our own market. So you can see that in the coming year, there are a number of things that we will be pursuing.

First of all, in terms of the listing requirements, we will enhance our listing requirements to see how we can further our competitiveness in the capital market, in particular on the weighted voting rights, and the second one is on the secondary trading. We are also looking into how we can bring our clearing cycle from the current T+2 into T+1 with the market. At the same time, we are now reviewing our board lot size, and also the minimum spread of our stock market, with a view to enhancing the overall liquidity of our capital market.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"
Labour Department launches special enforcement operation targeting construction sites of new works,2026-01-26 12:38,2026-01-26 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600341.htm,"The Labour Department (LD) has launched a two-week territory-wide special enforcement operation (SEO) today (January 26) to curb unsafe work activities. This SEO targets construction sites of new works, focusing on work-at-height and high-risk work processes as well as machinery and plant (such as lifting equipment and power-operated elevating work platforms).

In view of the recent spate of serious work accidents at construction sites, the LD will immediately take stringent enforcement actions if any violations of the occupational safety and health (OSH) legislation are detected, including initiating prosecutions as well as issuing suspension notices and improvement notices.

To enhance enforcement efficiency, the LD also uses small unmanned aircraft to conduct aerial remote surveillance of construction sites. Upon detecting unsafe work practices, photos and videos will be taken immediately for evidence collection to support inspections and enforcement actions.

Under the general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, employers are obligated to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

The LD reiterates that concerted efforts of employers and employees are essential for safeguarding the OSH of construction workers and building a safety culture. Apart from conducting the SEO, the LD will continue to adopt a multipronged strategy to foster an OSH culture and prevent accidents through regular inspections, publicity and promotion, education and training as well as the use of new technologies."

Speech by CE at Asian Financial Forum (English only) (with photos/video),2026-01-26 11:25,2026-01-26 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600277.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Asian Financial Forum (AFF) today (January 26):

Honourable Director Zhou Ji of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Honourable Deputy Governor Zou Lan of People's Bank of China, Honourable Commissioner Cui Jiancun of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Honourable Executive Vice Mayor Wu Wei of Shanghai, Honourable Vice Governor Wang Junshou of Hunan, Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), government officials and distinguished guests from around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. And welcome to Hong Kong and the 19th Asian Financial Forum.

  I would first like to welcome our friends coming from around the world. I extend my warmest welcome to His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Klemen Bostjancic of Slovenia (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Slovenia), His Excellency Minister Mehmet Simsek from Türkiye (Minister of Treasury and Finance of Türkiye), as well as other officials and representatives of different countries. I also welcome Her Excellency Zou Jiayi, who has recently assumed the post of President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, for joining us here. Thank you all.

  It is a great pleasure to be with you today - and so many of you, I'm delighted to see. Over these next two days, more than 3 600 are expected - high-profile finance and business leaders, visionary investors and entrepreneurs, senior policymakers, academics, economists and many other respected decision-makers, from more than 60 countries and regions.

  The inaugural Global Business Summit is among the many highlights of this year's Forum. Designed to encourage deeper financial and industrial co-operation, it will be held throughout tomorrow, day two of the AFF.

  Both days, with their panel discussions, plenaries, thematic workshops, fireside chats and other sessions, are organised under the tagline ""Finance Empowering Business"" and overall theme, ""Co-creating New Horizons amid an Evolving Landscape"". Featuring more than 150 prominent speakers, from Hong Kong, throughout the Asian region and around the world, the Forum will inspire insight and innovation, create partnerships and explore fresh business opportunities.

  I can't think of a better way to ring in this New Year, with its daunting issues and, yes, its boundless opportunities.

  Speaking of ""boundless opportunities"", allow me a few minutes to update you on Hong Kong, what we're doing and what we're planning to realise our far-reaching financial and business promise.

  It begins with ""one country, two systems"", the unique principle that assures us of the unwavering support of China, our country, while continuing to expand our global markets and reach. This unparalleled positioning solidifies our institutional strengths: the rule of law, a judiciary that exercises its power independently, an open and transparent market, the free flow of capital and a low and simple tax regime.

  These have ensured Hong Kong thrives as a top destination for enterprises that seek to grow and develop, in an environment that's safe and convenient to do business. You don't just have to take my word for it.

  Ladies and gentlemen, as we welcome the New Year, I am pleased to announce to you all, a truly international audience, that Hong Kong has made unprecedented achievements in the past year - in attracting quality businesses to our city.

  According to our annual survey, the number of foreign- and Mainland-affiliated companies in Hong Kong was 11 070 in 2025, up 11 per cent from the year before. That's a record high number of firms with their parent companies located outside Hong Kong.

  We've seen a robust growth of companies coming from a wide range of places. For example, those from Singapore, France, Australia, the United States and Switzerland have all risen by over 11 per cent. Companies from countries in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the Middle East have also grown by some 10 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, Mainland Chinese companies here have grown a whopping 17 per cent. Together, these enterprises from around the world hired nearly 510 000 people - more than half a million - in Hong Kong, up 3 per cent from 2024.

  We do more than bring in companies - we're also good at nurturing them. Last year, the number of start-ups in Hong Kong grew to over 5 200, again a record-breaking high, and up 11 per cent from 2024. Our start-ups hired nearly 20 000 people in Hong Kong; that's a 12 per cent growth year on year. And like our companies, our non-local entrepreneurs come from a large variety of places, with half of them coming mainly from the UK, the US, France and different Asian countries, and the other half from the Mainland.

  The encouraging results represent more than a vote of confidence in Hong Kong by these businesses and entrepreneurs. They also mean our solid efforts in facilitating business establishment and operation, and in creating an enabling ecosystem for start-ups, are bearing fruit.

  As you would know, companies turn to Hong Kong for many reasons - but our prowess as a financial hub is certainly a key factor.Hong Kong's financial regulatory system is robust, and our financial market stands out for its deep liquidity, innovative products and world-class investor protection. We also boast a highly educated workforce, a welcoming environment for global talent and transparent financial regulations aligned with international standards.

  These strengths are widely recognised. We ranked third, globally, and first in Asia, in the most recent Global Financial Centres Index. And we placed third in the 2025 World Competitiveness Yearbook, up two places over the previous year.

  Over the past year, we introduced a series of measures to enhance Hong Kong's listing mechanism and stock market. The results are clearly encouraging: the Hang Seng Index surged about 30 per cent last year, while average daily turnover rose to over US$32 billion.

  And Hong Kong ranked No.1 in the world last year in initial public offerings, raising some US$36 billion.

  Hong Kong has long been recognised as a hub for asset owners and family offices. At the end of 2024, we managed more than US$4.5 trillion in assets, 11 times our GDP - a year-on-year growth of 13 per cent.

  More than 200 family offices had set up operations or expanded their business here by the end of 2025.And we are working to welcome at least 220 more family offices to establish operations or expand their business in Hong Kong by 2028.

  As the world's largest offshore Renminbi business hub, Hong Kong processes about three quarters of global offshore Renminbi payments and has the largest offshore Renminbi liquidity pool.

  Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced a Renminbi Trade Finance Liquidity Facility. It was upgraded, last October, into a Renminbi Business Facility, allowing banks to expand the use of Renminbi by their corporate customers.

  The launch, also last year, of offshore Renminbi repurchase and cross-boundary repurchase businesses has boosted Renminbi liquidity channels. These arrangements provide investors with greater convenience, and more stable support, in obtaining liquidity and accessing the onshore repurchase business.

  In international bond issuance by Asian institutions, the volume arranged by Hong Kong in 2024 totalled more than US$130 billion, accounting for about 30 per cent of the market.

  Hong Kong has an active dim sum bond market as well, with issuance volume breaking the RMB1 trillion mark in 2024 and expected to reach a similar level in 2025.

  Hong Kong is also a leading green and sustainable finance hub. In 2024, the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to about US$43 billion, capturing 45 per cent of the regional total and topping the Asian market for seven consecutive years.

  To date, we have issued government green bonds totalling US$32 billion, including retail, institutional and tokenised bonds of multiple currencies and tenors, raising funds for many local green projects.

  As of last September, we had issued over 200 ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds, with assets under management of more than US$141 billion. The number of ESG funds and assets under management increased 32 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, from three years ago.

  To boost our status as an international financial centre, we are focused on three main areas.

  First, we are working to reinforce Hong Kong's strengths. That includes deepening our equity market, expanding our bond market and advancing the asset management and wealth management sector.

  To boost our stock market, we introduced the Technology Enterprises Channel. It helps Mainland and international technology companies raise funds in Hong Kong.

  To elevate our status as one of the world's leading fundraising and investment hubs, we will optimise the Main Board's regimes for listing and issuing products.

  The HKEX (Hong KongExchanges and Clearing Limited) is working to enable electronic securities holding and trading and will put forward a proposal, in the coming months, to shorten the settlement cycle for Hong Kong's cash equities market. That, ladies and gentlemen, will create a solid foundation for the sustained growth of our capital markets.

  Rising global investor interest in Renminbi-denominated bonds highlights Hong Kong's pivotal role as a gateway for cross-boundary capital flow. And we will continue to explore measures that deepen mutual access between Mainland and Hong Kong financial markets. That includes introducing offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong and expanding interest rate derivatives under Swap Connect.

  Second, we are expediting the development of new growth areas. That very much includes building an international gold trading market and commodities trading ecosystem in Hong Kong.

  In a moment, you'll witness a bright illustration of our gold ambitions - the signing of a co-operation agreement between the Shanghai Gold Exchange and the HKSAR Government. The co-operation agreement will set in motion a cross-boundary, trade-clearing system for the precious metal.

  The HKSAR Government is also committed to expanding Hong Kong's gold storage, targeting a storing capacity of more than 2 000 tonnes in three years. That, ladies and gentlemen, will see Hong Kong's rise as a regional gold reserve hub.

  A central clearing system for gold will be established here, to provide efficient and reliable clearing services for gold transactions, in compliance with international standards.

  We will also diversify gold investment and work with the trade to form an industry organisation in Hong Kong.

  In commodities trading, we joined the London Metal Exchange's global warehousing network last January.

  To date, 15 Hong Kong warehouses have begun operations, with more than 20 000 tonnes of metals on warrant to support the Exchange's contract delivery.

  Turning to fintech, last June, we issued a second policy statement on digital assets, reinforcing the Government's commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for digital asset innovation.

  And last August, our Stablecoins Ordinance came into effect, providing a licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong.

  Last month, we published the consultation conclusions on proposed licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers. We plan to introduce a bill into the legislature later this year.

  Last November, we expanded the products and services that can be offered by licensed, virtual asset trading platforms, and we will also promote artificial intelligence business applications.

  In the carbon market, the HKEX signed an MOU last year with the Guangzhou Emissions Exchange, the Shenzhen Green Exchange and the Macao International Carbon Emission Exchange, pledging to accelerate the Greater Bay Area's carbon markets and green finance development.

  Because there's so much more that Hong Kong, a leading financial hub, could do to promote sustainability in the capital market. That, I'm glad to add, has been recognised by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, which confirmed, last June, that Hong Kong is one of the first jurisdictions to have set a target for fully adopting the Sustainability Disclosure Standards of the International Financial Reporting Standards.

  Third, international exchanges and co-operation remain a priority. We will assist companies interested in re-domiciling to Hong Kong, a world city that makes it much easier to connect with the globe and excel. Our company re-domiciliation regime, in effect since last May, has been positively received.

  To date, 14 non-Hong Kong corporations have re-domiciled to Hong Kong.

  And we are working on measures to attract more Mainland enterprises to establish Corporate Treasury Centres here.

  Ladies and gentlemen, that's just a taste of what we're doing to boost Hong Kong's status as an international business and financial centre, while ensuring a safe and stable environment for companies and investors.

  I am grateful to the organisers of the Asian Financial Forum, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the Government's Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, for once again bringing us together for finance and business - and, I trust, the many pleasures that Hong Kong, Asia's world city, offers.

  In just over three weeks, we will celebrate the Lunar New Year - the Year of the Horse.

  The horse symbolises vitality, perseverance and progress, qualities I'm sure we all look forward to realising, despite the hurdles and obstacles we face in today's non-stop geopolitical steeplechase.

  Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a rewarding Asian Financial Forum, and a healthy and prosperous Year of the Horse.

  Thank you."

That, ladies and gentlemen, will create a solid foundation for the sustained growth of our capital markets.

  Rising global investor interest in Renminbi-denominated bonds highlights Hong Kong's pivotal role as a gateway for cross-boundary capital flow. And we will continue to explore measures that deepen mutual access between Mainland and Hong Kong financial markets. That includes introducing offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong and expanding interest rate derivatives under Swap Connect.

  Second, we are expediting the development of new growth areas. That very much includes building an international gold trading market and commodities trading ecosystem in Hong Kong.

  In a moment, you'll witness a bright illustration of our gold ambitions - the signing of a co-operation agreement between the Shanghai Gold Exchange and the HKSAR Government. The co-operation agreement will set in motion a cross-boundary, trade-clearing system for the precious metal.

  The HKSAR Government is also committed to expanding Hong Kong's gold storage, targeting a storing capacity of more than 2 000 tonnes in three years. That, ladies and gentlemen, will see Hong Kong's rise as a regional gold reserve hub.

  A central clearing system for gold will be established here, to provide efficient and reliable clearing services for gold transactions, in compliance with international standards.

  We will also diversify gold investment and work with the trade to form an industry organisation in Hong Kong.

  In commodities trading, we joined the London Metal Exchange's global warehousing network last January.

  To date, 15 Hong Kong warehouses have begun operations, with more than 20 000 tonnes of metals on warrant to support the Exchange's contract delivery.

  Turning to fintech, last June, we issued a second policy statement on digital assets, reinforcing the Government's commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for digital asset innovation.

  And last August, our Stablecoins Ordinance came into effect, providing a licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong.

  Last month, we published the consultation conclusions on proposed licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers. We plan to introduce a bill into the legislature later this year.

  Last November, we expanded the products and services that can be offered by licensed, virtual asset trading platforms, and we will also promote artificial intelligence business applications.

  In the carbon market, the HKEX signed an MOU last year with the Guangzhou Emissions Exchange, the Shenzhen Green Exchange and the Macao International Carbon Emission Exchange, pledging to accelerate the Greater Bay Area's carbon markets and green finance development.

  Because there's so much more that Hong Kong, a leading financial hub, could do to promote sustainability in the capital market. That, I'm glad to add, has been recognised by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, which confirmed, last June, that Hong Kong is one of the first jurisdictions to have set a target for fully adopting the Sustainability Disclosure Standards of the International Financial Reporting Standards.

  Third, international exchanges and co-operation remain a priority. We will assist companies interested in re-domiciling to Hong Kong, a world city that makes it much easier to connect with the globe and excel. Our company re-domiciliation regime, in effect since last May, has been positively received.

  To date, 14 non-Hong Kong corporations have re-domiciled to Hong Kong.

  And we are working on measures to attract more Mainland enterprises to establish Corporate Treasury Centres here.

  Ladies and gentlemen, that's just a taste of what we're doing to boost Hong Kong's status as an international business and financial centre, while ensuring a safe and stable environment for companies and investors.

  I am grateful to the organisers of the Asian Financial Forum, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the Government's Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, for once again bringing us together for finance and business - and, I trust, the many pleasures that Hong Kong, Asia's world city, offers.

  In just over three weeks, we will celebrate the Lunar New Year - the Year of the Horse.

  The horse symbolises vitality, perseverance and progress, qualities I'm sure we all look forward to realising, despite the hurdles and obstacles we face in today's non-stop geopolitical steeplechase.

  Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a rewarding Asian Financial Forum, and a healthy and prosperous Year of the Horse.

  Thank you."

Remarks by SFST at agreement signing ceremony with Shanghai Gold Exchange (English only),2026-01-26 10:52,2026-01-26 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600219.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the agreement signing ceremony with the Shanghai Gold Exchange at the Asian Financial Forum today (January 26):

Deputy Governor Zou (Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr Zou Lan), Vice Mayor Wu Wei (Member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei), Director Zhou (Executive Deputy Director of the Office of the Financial Commission of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Mr Zhou Xiaoquan), Chairman Yu (Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Mr Yu Wenjian), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great privilege to address you today at the Asian Financial Forum. As we convene in Hong Kong, the world's leading international financial centre, we just now witnessed a defining milestone in the development of our gold market as highlighted by the previous two keynote speeches, with my bureau and the Shanghai Gold Exchange signing a landmark co-operation agreement.

Gold has long been regarded as a cornerstone of the global financial system. Its unique physical attributes, inherent scarcity, and proven safe-haven function make it irreplaceable in areas such as national reserves, asset allocation and diversification. In recent years, amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and ongoing restructuring of the international monetary system, the strategic importance of gold has become even more pronounced. Against this backdrop, deepening co-operation between Hong Kong and Shanghai in the gold sector carries profound significance.

The agreement just now signed is far more than a formal document. It represents a resolute commitment to advancing the synergistic development of Hong Kong and Shanghai as premier international financial and gold markets. It reflects our joint determination to deepen the integration and complementary strengths of Hong Kong and Shanghai, so that together we can expand our share and influence in the global gold market, and better support Renminbi (RMB) internationalisation. Guided by the principles of mutual learning, win-win co-operation, interconnectivity, mutual recognition and shared development, we will leverage the distinctive advantages of both markets to enhance transaction and delivery efficiency, and elevate our voice in international gold pricing and governance.

Two elements of this agreement stand out as particularly significant and forward-looking. First, we are establishing a high-level, collaborative governance structure for Hong Kong's new gold central clearing system. The Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Company Limited - wholly owned by the Government - will have its Board chaired by myself, while a representative from the Shanghai Gold Exchange will serve as Deputy Chairman. In that capacity, representative of the Shanghai Gold Exchange will actively participate in the Board, contributing to the preparation of the gold central clearing system, the formulation of rules, the admission of participating institutions, and the provision of expert advice on system design, risk management and other areas.

Second, we are opening exciting new avenues for physical infrastructure synergy and market interconnectivity. Our two sides will explore leveraging the Shanghai Gold Exchange's well-established physical warehousing management regime to provide secure gold management services for participants in both the Hong Kong and international markets. Building on this foundation, we aim to drive greater connectivity between on-exchange and off-exchange gold trading activities. Through the central clearing system and key participants in the emerging Hong Kong gold trading ecosystem, we will explore practical measures to deliver greater business convenience and technical alignment, enabling investors from both sides to participate more seamlessly and cost effectively in each of our own markets. These initiatives will create a truly integrated, efficient and open ecosystem that serves participants across both markets.

This co-operation agreement sits within a broader, holistic vision for Hong Kong's gold market ecosystem - one that we are developing with determination and strategic coherence, where every measure is purposefully designed to build trust among global participants and promote innovation in products, infrastructure, and practices.

We are actively supporting the Airport Authority Hong Kong and financial institutions to establish advanced gold storage facilities - building trust through secure and scalable custody solutions, while promoting innovation in logistics and physical flows. The target is to exceed 2 000 tonnes of storage capacity within three years, making Hong Kong a trusted global vault. The Airport Authority has already launched a project to expand warehousing to a thousand-tonne scale, catering to local storage, delivery and also transit requirements.

We have also strengthened regional linkages through a Memorandum of Understanding signed between my bureau and our Shenzhen counterpart - building trust via clear policy guidance, and promoting innovation in GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) supply chain integration - which provides solid support for Hong Kong gold traders to co-operate with qualified Shenzhen refining enterprises in processing trade, unlocking new value in the supply chain.

On trading and clearing, Hong Kong's government-led central clearing system for gold is on track to begin trial operations this year - building trust through enhanced transparency, robust risk mitigation, and a reliable settlement mechanism in line with global best practices, while promoting innovation in efficient market operation.

For the preferential tax regimes offered to funds and single family offices, the Government will propose including precious metals as qualifying investments. The target is to introduce the legislative proposal in the first half of this year.

We are also expanding the range of investment options - building trust with reliable, accessible vehicles backed by physical assets, and promoting innovation at the intersection of traditional and digital finance. This week, a new gold fund will list in Hong Kong. Its key features include leveraging Hong Kong's well-established gold infrastructure for physical gold trading and storage, with the option of physical gold redemption at bank. Also, the issuer plans to explore an unlisted share class for potential distribution through licensed digital asset exchanges.

Furthermore, at a gold-themed session later today at this forum, market participants will release an outlook on the development of Hong Kong's sustainable gold governance framework and standards, with a view to fostering sustainable sourcing, environmental protection, and long-term responsibility standards.

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, the signing of an agreement with the Shanghai Gold Exchange marks the dawn of a new chapter - one in which Hong Kong and Shanghai join forces to shape the future of global gold markets. Let us embrace this historic opportunity to build stronger bridges, ignite innovation and create enduring value for investors and economies alike. Thank you."

"金管局人民幣業務資金安排總額度倍增至2,000億元人民幣",2026-01-26 10:45,2026-01-26 11:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600247.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（一月二十六日）宣布，其人民幣業務資金安排的總額度將由目前的1,000億元人民幣增加至2,000億元人民幣，新額度將於二月二日起生效。

在中國人民銀行（人民銀行）的大力支持下，金管局借助與人民銀行的貨幣互換安排，在二○二五年十月推出人民幣業務資金安排，升級替代同年二月出台的人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排。這項新舉措為銀行提供穩定、成本較低的人民幣資金，讓銀行有更充裕的資金向企業客戶提供人民幣融資，支持在實體經濟中更廣泛地使用人民幣。這項安排有序地將在岸人民幣引入離岸市場，經香港輻射到世界其他地區，進一步強化香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的獨特優勢和地位。

自升級安排推出以來，銀行業界反應踴躍，1,000億元人民幣的總額度已全數分配給40家參與銀行。在新安排下，融資對象從參與銀行的企業客戶伸延至其集團的境外銀行機構的企業客戶，資金用途亦從貿易融資擴展至資本支出和營運資金定期貸款。實施以來，額度使用量持續增長，有個別參與銀行的額度使用已經達到或接近上限。安排除了服務香港的企業，更成功將離岸人民幣資金輻射到東盟、中東和歐洲等地。此外，亦有其他銀行一直積極表達參與該安排的意願。

人民幣業務資金安排總額度倍增至2,000億元人民幣後，已參與銀行可按業務需求申請增加額度，而其他有興趣參與的銀行亦可向金管局提出申請，金管局將按既定準則批出新的額度。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「我們衷心感謝人民銀行的大力支持，令人民幣業務資金安排得以不斷升級擴容。安排的總額度增至2,000億元人民幣，令金管局可以配合市場的發展需要，適時提供充足的人民幣流動性，協助銀行拓展人民幣業務，支持實體經濟健康發展，同時進一步鞏固提升香港國際金融中心和離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。我們會不時審視落實情況，包括各參與銀行的額度使用程度，聽取市場的反饋意見，按實際需要持續優化。我們亦歡迎人民銀行支持香港人民幣清算行通過發行同業存單等不同方式從境內市場獲取不同期限的流動性，這有利於香港清算行提高服務能力，也對離岸市場的流動性供應帶來正面作用。」

​人民幣業務資金安排的額度申請指引、條款及操作細節請見金管局網站。"
HKMA RMB Business Facility doubles to RMB200 billion in size,2026-01-26 10:45,2026-01-26 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600250.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

​The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (January 26) that the total size of the RMB Business Facility (RBF) will increase from the current RMB100 billion to RMB200 billion, with effect from February 2.

With the strong support of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA leveraged the currency swap arrangement with the PBoC to launch the RBF in October 2025, which replaced and enhanced the RMB Trade Financing Liquidity Facility introduced in February 2025. The RBF provides banks with a stable and relatively lower-cost source of Renminbi (RMB) funds, enabling them to offer RMB financing to their corporate clients and support the wider use of RMB in the real economy. The facility channels onshore RMB liquidity into offshore markets in an orderly manner, by adopting a ""hub-and-spoke"" model with Hong Kong as the hub, further enhancing Hong Kong's unique advantages and role as the global offshore RMB business hub.

​The RBF has received overwhelming response from the banking sector since its launch, with the RMB100 billion aggregate quota fully allocated to 40 participating banks. With the implementation of the RBF, eligible end-users have extended from corporate clients of Hong Kong banks to cover also corporate clients of the participating banks' overseas intragroup banking entities. Eligible activities have also been expanded from trade finance to cover capital expenditure and working capital term loans. With the increasing usage of the facility, some participating banks have reached or are approaching the cap of their quotas. The experience so far suggests that the RBF has not only served corporates in Hong Kong but has also successfully channelled offshore RMB funds to regions such as the ASEAN countries, the Middle East, and Europe. Meanwhile, more banks have indicated keen interest in participating in the RBF.

​The doubling of the RBF to RMB200 billion provides space to raise quota allocated to participating banks and to onboard more banks. The HKMA welcomes existing and aspiring banks to submit applications and will consider the allocation of quotas in accordance with established practice.

​Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, said, ""We are grateful to the PBoC for its strong support, which has enabled the continued upgrading and expansion of the RBF. The increase of the facility size to RMB200 billion enables the HKMA to provide timely and sufficient RMB liquidity to meet market development needs, assist banks to enhance their RMB business, support the healthy development of the real economy, and further reinforce Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and global offshore RMB business hub. We will continue to monitor the implementation of the RBF, including quota utilisation by participating banks, collect market feedback, and enhance the RBF as appropriate. We also welcome PBoC's support for the Hong Kong RMB Clearing Bank to issue negotiable certificates of deposit onshore, thereby expanding its access to liquidity across various maturities. This will strengthen the Clearing Bank's service capabilities and contribute positively to offshore RMB liquidity condition.""

The guidance to RBF quota application, terms and conditions, as well as operation procedures can be found on the HKMA website."

財庫局與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議　推動香港黃金市場高質量發展,2026-01-26 10:10,2026-01-26 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600169.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）今日（一月二十六日）在亞洲金融論壇上，與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，標誌滬港兩地黃金市場深化合作邁向新里程。財庫局同場亦公布了六項有關黃金巿場發展的新動向。

合作協議在行政長官李家超、中國人民銀行副行長鄒瀾、上海市委常委、常務副市長吳偉，以及上海市委金融委員會辦公室常務副主任周小全見證下，由財庫局局長許正宇與上海黃金交易所理事長余文建簽署。

許正宇並在簽署儀式上闡述合作協議的戰略意義和香港黃金市場的整體發展藍圖。他說：「黃金作為全球金融體系的基石之一，其獨特的物理屬性、稀缺性和避險功能，使其在各國儲備及資產多元配置中不可或缺。在地緣政治不確定性加劇、通脹壓力持續，以及國際貨幣體系重構的背景下，黃金的戰略重要性更為突顯。財庫局與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，體現我們堅定落實中央金融工作會議精神，推進高質量金融開放，促進香港與上海作為國際金融中心及黃金市場的協同發展。」

這份別具意義的合作協議重點包括兩項前瞻性安排：一是建立香港黃金中央結算系統的高層次協作治理架構。特區政府全資擁有的「香港貴金屬中央結算系統有限公司」（「港金結算公司」）董事會將由財庫局局長擔任主席，上海黃金交易所代表出任副主席。上海黃金交易所代表將在公司董事會中具體參與香港黃金中央清算系統準備、規則制定和機構認可等事宜，並就系統建設及風險管理等提供專業意見。滬港將攜手推動結算平台高效建設，並與國際接軌。

二是開拓實物基礎設施協同及市場互聯互通新路徑。雙方將探索依託上海黃金交易所實物倉儲管理體系，為香港本地及海內外市場參與者的黃金業務提供實物存儲服務，並在此基礎上帶動場內外業務的互聯互通。同時，雙方將積極推進兩地黃金市場更大程度的互聯互通，探索通過「港金結算公司」及香港黃金交易生態圈的重要參與者，為兩地投資者參與市場提供業務便利與技術支援，構建真正一體化、高效開放的黃金生態圈。

許正宇也進一步闡述政府對香港黃金市場發展的整體願景及配套措施，包括：

1. 推動香港機場管理局（機管局）及金融機構在港拓展黃金倉儲容量，以三年超越2 000噸為目標，使香港成為全球信賴的黃金儲存地。機管局已立項擴展在機場的倉儲設施，規模將達至千噸級別，兼顧本地儲存、交割和過境轉運需求；

2.財庫局已與深圳市地方金融管理局就港深兩地開展加工貿易合作簽署合作備忘錄，歡迎香港金商與深圳具備相關資格的精煉企業開展實質合作；

3.由政府全資擁有的公司所管理的香港黃金中央清算系統計劃於今年內試營運；

4. 政府計劃於今年上半年提交立法建議，把貴金屬納入有關基金及單一家族辦公室的優惠稅制合資格投資範圍；

5.本星期，香港將有一支全新的黃金基金上市，主要特色除了包括透過香港本地完善的黃金基礎設施，進行所有實金交易及黃金儲存，提供於銀行兌換實物黃金的選項，還計劃推出非上市類別，探索透過持牌數字資產交易平台分銷，連接傳統與數碼金融；和

6.市場機構在亞洲金融論壇的黃金專題環節上公布香港可持續黃金治理框架和標準體系建設展望，以推動合乎道德及可持續的採購、環境保護及長期責任標準。

許正宇強調：「我們與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，開啓香港與上海攜手塑造全球黃金市場未來的新篇章。我們將把握歷史機遇，搭建更堅固橋樑，激發創新，為全球投資者及經濟體創造持久價值。」"

The Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Company Limited, which is wholly owned by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, will have its Board chaired by the SFST while a representative from the Shanghai Gold Exchange will serve as Deputy Chairman. The representative of the Shanghai Gold Exchange will actively participate in the Board, contributing to the preparation of the system, the formulation of rules, the admission of participating institutions, and the provision of expert advice on system design, risk management and other areas. Shanghai and Hong Kong will work together to promote the efficient development of the clearing system and its alignment with international standards.

2. Opening new avenues for physical infrastructure synergy and market interconnectivity. The two sides will explore leveraging the Shanghai Gold Exchange's well-established physical warehousing management regime to provide secure gold management services for participants in both Hong Kong and international markets. The two sides aim to drive greater connectivity between on-exchange and off-exchange gold trading activities. The two sides will forge ahead broader mutual market access by exploring the provision of business convenience and technical alignment to investors from two places through the Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Company Limited and key participants in the emerging Hong Kong gold trading ecosystem, thereby creating a truly integrated, efficient and open ecosystem.

Mr Hui further elaborated on the Government's vision and supporting measures for Hong Kong's gold market development. They are:

1. Supporting the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) and financial institutions in establishing gold storage facilities, with a target to exceed 2,000 tonnes of storage capacity within three years, making Hong Kong a trusted global vault. The AAHK has launched a project to expand warehousing to a thousand-tonne scale, catering to local storage, delivery and transit requirements.

2. The FSTB has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau, laying the foundation for processing trade co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The next step is to welcome Hong Kong gold traders to engage in substantive co-operation with qualified Shenzhen refining enterprises.

3. Hong Kong's government-owned central clearing system for gold is on track to begin trial operations this year.

4. For the preferential tax regimes offered to funds and single family offices, the Government will propose including precious metals as qualifying investments. The target is to introduce the legislative proposal in the first half of this year.

5. This week, a new gold fund will list in Hong Kong. Its key features include leveraging Hong Kong's well-established gold infrastructure for physical gold trading and storage, with the option of physical gold redemption at bank. Also, the issuer plans to introduce an unlisted share class for potential distribution through licensed digital asset exchanges, bridging traditional and digital finance.

6. The release of an outlook by market participants on the development of Hong Kong's sustainable gold governance framework and standards at the gold-themed session of the Asian Financial Forum, with a view to fostering sustainable sourcing, environmental protection, and long-term responsibility standards.

Mr Hui stressed, ""The signing of this agreement with the Shanghai Gold Exchange marks the dawn of a new chapter—one in which Hong Kong and Shanghai join forces to shape the future of global gold markets. Let us embrace this historic opportunity to build stronger bridges, ignite innovation and create enduring value for investors and economies alike."""

合作協議在行政長官李家超、中國人民銀行副行長鄒瀾、上海市委常委、常務副市長吳偉，以及上海市委金融委員會辦公室常務副主任周小全見證下，由財庫局局長許正宇與上海黃金交易所理事長余文建簽署。

許正宇並在簽署儀式上闡述合作協議的戰略意義和香港黃金市場的整體發展藍圖。他說：「黃金作為全球金融體系的基石之一，其獨特的物理屬性、稀缺性和避險功能，使其在各國儲備及資產多元配置中不可或缺。在地緣政治不確定性加劇、通脹壓力持續，以及國際貨幣體系重構的背景下，黃金的戰略重要性更為突顯。財庫局與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，體現我們堅定落實中央金融工作會議精神，推進高質量金融開放，促進香港與上海作為國際金融中心及黃金市場的協同發展。」

這份別具意義的合作協議重點包括兩項前瞻性安排：一是建立香港黃金中央結算系統的高層次協作治理架構。特區政府全資擁有的「香港貴金屬中央結算系統有限公司」（「港金結算公司」）董事會將由財庫局局長擔任主席，上海黃金交易所代表出任副主席。上海黃金交易所代表將在公司董事會中具體參與香港黃金中央清算系統準備、規則制定和機構認可等事宜，並就系統建設及風險管理等提供專業意見。滬港將攜手推動結算平台高效建設，並與國際接軌。

二是開拓實物基礎設施協同及市場互聯互通新路徑。雙方將探索依託上海黃金交易所實物倉儲管理體系，為香港本地及海內外市場參與者的黃金業務提供實物存儲服務，並在此基礎上帶動場內外業務的互聯互通。同時，雙方將積極推進兩地黃金市場更大程度的互聯互通，探索通過「港金結算公司」及香港黃金交易生態圈的重要參與者，為兩地投資者參與市場提供業務便利與技術支援，構建真正一體化、高效開放的黃金生態圈。

許正宇也進一步闡述政府對香港黃金市場發展的整體願景及配套措施，包括：

1. 推動香港機場管理局（機管局）及金融機構在港拓展黃金倉儲容量，以三年超越2 000噸為目標，使香港成為全球信賴的黃金儲存地。機管局已立項擴展在機場的倉儲設施，規模將達至千噸級別，兼顧本地儲存、交割和過境轉運需求；

2.財庫局已與深圳市地方金融管理局就港深兩地開展加工貿易合作簽署合作備忘錄，歡迎香港金商與深圳具備相關資格的精煉企業開展實質合作；

3.由政府全資擁有的公司所管理的香港黃金中央清算系統計劃於今年內試營運；

4. 政府計劃於今年上半年提交立法建議，把貴金屬納入有關基金及單一家族辦公室的優惠稅制合資格投資範圍；

5.本星期，香港將有一支全新的黃金基金上市，主要特色除了包括透過香港本地完善的黃金基礎設施，進行所有實金交易及黃金儲存，提供於銀行兌換實物黃金的選項，還計劃推出非上市類別，探索透過持牌數字資產交易平台分銷，連接傳統與數碼金融；和

6.市場機構在亞洲金融論壇的黃金專題環節上公布香港可持續黃金治理框架和標準體系建設展望，以推動合乎道德及可持續的採購、環境保護及長期責任標準。

許正宇強調：「我們與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，開啓香港與上海攜手塑造全球黃金市場未來的新篇章。我們將把握歷史機遇，搭建更堅固橋樑，激發創新，為全球投資者及經濟體創造持久價值。」"

The FSTB also revealed new moves in six aspects relating to the development of gold market at the same time.

The agreement was signed by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (SFST), Mr Christopher Hui, and the Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Mr Yu Wenjian, in the presence of the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee; the Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr Zou Lan; Member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei; and the Executive Deputy Director of the Office of the Financial Commission of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Mr Zhou Xiaoquan.

Mr Hui also outlined the strategic significance of the agreement and the overall development blueprint for Hong Kong's gold market at the signing ceremony. He said, ""Gold has long been regarded as a cornerstone of the global financial system. Its unique physical attributes, inherent scarcity, and proven safe-haven function make it irreplaceable in areas such as national reserves, asset allocation and diversification. In recent years, amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and ongoing restructuring of the international monetary system, the strategic importance of gold has become even more pronounced. The agreement signed by the FSTB and Shanghai Gold Exchange represents a resolute commitment to translating the spirit of the Central Financial Work Conference, advancing quality financial opening into concrete action while fostering synergistic development of Hong Kong and Shanghai as premier international financial and gold markets.""

This significant agreement covers two major forward-looking areas of co-operation:

商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺表示：「即使面對地緣政治和環球經貿格局的轉變，香港一直積極發揮在『一國兩制』下無可比擬的獨特優勢，是海外企業開拓內地龐大市場和內地企業出海的最佳雙向跳板。加上政府推出一系列促進經濟的政策措施，包括成立內地企業出海專班、制定優惠政策包吸引高增值產業落戶、加速發展北部都會區、開設駐吉隆坡經濟貿易辦事處等，將繼續增強香港的優勢，加速為經濟注入新動力，為駐港海內外企業帶來更多機遇。」

他續說：「另一方面，香港的初創企業數目持續錄得雙位數字的百分比增長，足證香港是初創企業落戶的理想地點和環球初創企業家對香港的強大信心。初創企業可善用香港的優勢，包括匯聚國際一流的大學及科研機構、具創業精神的人才、來自全球的投資者、以及本地強大的孵化器及加速器網絡等，快速發展創科業務，一展所長。」

上述的本地調查結果充分證明海內外企業對香港前景充滿信心，而香港近期亦在多份國際機構報告中名列前茅，包括再次獲菲沙研究所評定為全球最自由經濟體，以及在聯合國貿易和發展發布的《2025年世界投資報告》中，於外來直接投資流入方面總體排名上升至第三位，印證香港作為世界公認的國際商業和投資樞紐。

Record high numbers of companies and start-ups affirm Hong Kong's incomparable business advantages,2026-01-26 09:26,2026-01-26 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600135.htm," According to the results of the 2025 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located outside Hong Kong and the 2025 Startup Survey announced by the Government today (January 26), the number of companies in Hong Kong with Chinese Mainland or overseas parent companies rose to 11 070 in 2025, while the number of start-ups in Hong Kong increased to 5 221, both reaching record highs again. The results demonstrate that Hong Kong's unique attractiveness to enterprises from around the globe continues to rise, and that the city is the ideal investment destination to set up or expand businesses.

 The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said, ""Even though geopolitics and the global economic and trade landscape are evolving, Hong Kong has been proactively demonstrating its incomparably unique advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle, as the best two-way springboard for overseas enterprises to tap into the vast Chinese Mainland market and for Chinese Mainland enterprises to go global. Together with the wide array of the latest initiatives to promote economic development, including the establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global, the formulation of preferential policy packages to attract high value-added industries to Hong Kong, the accelerated development of the Northern Metropolis, the establishment of the Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, etc, Hong Kong's advantages will continue to strengthen, thereby accelerating the injection of new impetus to our economy and providing more opportunities for both Chinese Mainland and overseas companies based in Hong Kong.

 ""On another note, the number of start-ups in Hong Kong continues to grow at a double-digit percentage rate, signifying that the city is an ideal place for start-ups to thrive, and demonstrating the great confidence that global start-up entrepreneurs have in Hong Kong. Start-ups can leverage the strengths of Hong Kong - including its concentration of internationally renowned universities and research institutes, entrepreneurial talent, and investors from around the world, as well as a strong local network of incubators and accelerators, to rapidly develop innovation and technology businesses that showcase their strengths,"" Mr Yau added.

 The results of the above two local surveys fully display the confidence of Chinese Mainland and overseas companies in Hong Kong's future development. Also, Hong Kong recently received exceptional rankings in reports by various international institutes. For example, Hong Kong was again ranked by the Fraser Institute as the world's freest economy, and moved up to third place overall in foreign direct investment inflows in the World Investment Report 2025 released by the United Nations Trade and Development. Such recognition demonstrates the world's growing awareness of Hong Kong as an international hub for business and investment.

 According to the 2025 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located outside Hong Kong jointly conducted by Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) and the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), there were 11 070 companies in Hong Kong with parent companies located outside Hong Kong in 2025, representing an increase of 11 per cent, which amounted to 1 110 companies, when compared with 2024. The number of people employed reached 509 000, recording an increase of 3 per cent year on year.

 Analysed by the location of parent company, in 2025, the Chinese Mainland was ranked first (3 090), followed by the United States and Japan (both 1 550), the United Kingdom (770) and Singapore (590).

 Analysed by major line of business in Hong Kong, among those 11 070 companies, in 2025, the import/export trade, wholesale and retail sector topped the list (5 100), followed by the financing and banking sector (2 390), and the professional, business and education services sector (1 770).

 In addition, based on the results of InvestHK's 2025 Startup Survey, start-ups in Hong Kong continued to flourish with a record high number of 5 221, up 11 per cent year on year. These start-ups engaged 19 753 persons, representing an increase of 12 per cent year on year, spanned across different sectors, including financial technology; information, computer and technology; biotechnology; education and learning; and health and medical, etc.

 The results of the two surveys have been uploaded onto the websites of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110004&scode=360) and InvestHK (www.investhk.gov.hk/en/resource-centre/?type=brochures-and-guides-general) respectively."

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-25 17:30,2026-01-25 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/25/P2026012500485.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 25), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.
