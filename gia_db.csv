Customs officers intercepted a 63-year-old incoming female passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on November 25 and seized 381 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $1,500 and a duty potential of about $1,200 from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

衞生署公布基孔肯雅熱最新情況　忠告市民不要前往青衣自然徑,2025-12-09 17:18,2025-12-09 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900603.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月九日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。本港今年累計錄得78宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，10宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。另外，考慮到相關部門近期將在青衣自然徑進行更密集的滅蚊防蚊工作，青衣自然徑將於今日晚上起暫停向公眾開放，直至另行通告為止。中心忠告市民現階段不要前往青衣自然徑，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險。

因應近期有五宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，中心昨日（十二月八日）與食物環境衞生署（食環署）、民政事務總署、渠務署、地政總署和土木工程拓展署代表舉行跨部門會議，討論進一步加強有關地點的防治蚊患工作，以保障公眾衞生和健康。

該五宗本地個案涉及兩男三女，年齡介乎49至67歲。他們於十一月中旬至十二月二日期間發病。流行病學調查顯示，五名患者的活動地點在青衣自然徑重疊，部分報稱在該徑被蚊叮咬，其中最新一宗個案於十一月二十九日到訪該徑。

中心於十一月二十日接獲首宗個案呈報後，已即時聯絡相關部門，在青衣一帶展開大規模防蚊滅蚊行動。及後，鑑於一些個案的樣本分析結果顯示相同基因序列，中心經評估後認為該自然徑風險較高，早於十一月二十三日起透過不同途徑每日呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。中心在上月底亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

特別針對青衣自然徑一帶的情況，各部門已採取一系列措施：


食環署已透過跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內的防蚊滅蚊工作。食環署已利用大型超低微量噴霧器及機械狗等工具在該處一帶進行超過40次霧化處理殺滅成蚊行動，範圍涵蓋整條自然徑及自然徑外圍。食環署亦已清理約600個潛在蚊子滋生地，在80個無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑，並設置新型捕蚊器。此外，食環署向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。同時，食環署亦到訪附近範圍內的學校和幼兒設施，提供防蚊滅蚊資訊及協助。在巡查方面，食環署已加緊巡查自然徑附近一帶的地盤工地及住宅處所，向違規的負責人提出兩宗有關蚊蟲滋生的檢控及發出八張法定消除積水通知書。
負責青衣自然徑保養維修的葵青民政事務處（葵青民政處）已指示承辦商加強防蚊滅蚊工作，包括剪草、清理去水渠、進行霧化處理，以及施放蚊油／殺幼蟲劑等。另外，民政處已在青衣自然徑的出入口、涼亭及休憩處等張貼海報，提醒訪客及行山人士使用昆蟲驅避劑及採取防護措施。葵青民政處亦透過區議員、分區委員會和關愛隊的地區網絡向區內居民持續宣傳防蚊資訊。
渠務署自十一月底起於青衣自然徑一帶完成了多次渠道清理工作，將排水設施中的沙泥及雜物清除，確保渠道暢通以防止積水及蚊蟲滋生。
荃灣葵青地政處已清除了在相關政府土地上的非法耕種植物、金屬篷和竹枝。而土木工程拓展署亦要求承建商及駐工地督導人員，巡視工地及其鄰近範圍，確保在工地採取的防蚊措施達到最佳成效。預防及滅蚊措施，包括定期巡查、清理積水及噴灑蚊油，及在工地內設置蚊子陷阱並定期檢查及更換藥餌等。


儘管相關部門在過去兩至三周已進行一連串防蚊滅蚊行動，但仍發現有曾到訪青衣自然徑的市民受感染，顯示有關地帶的感染風險依然存在。青衣自然徑屬郊野環境且覆蓋範圍甚廣，行山徑長約7 000米，與市區環境相比，控蚊工作面臨更大挑戰。該自然徑兩旁的地方均存在着各種天然病媒滋生地，包括泥土表面的水窪、落葉等，增加蚊蟲滋生風險。

各部門昨日經討論後，已敲定進一步在青衣自然徑一帶加強防控蚊患的措施。考慮到近期將在該處進行更密集的滅蚊防蚊工作，青衣自然徑將會暫停向公眾開放，直至另行通告為止。在這段期間，食環署會聯同其他部門進一步在青衣自然徑一帶加強防控蚊患措施的力度及頻次，包括持續進行霧化處理殺滅成蚊行動。

中心將再次致函全港醫生，呼籲他們密切留意患者情況。一旦病人出現相關症狀，如發熱、關節痛或皮疹等，醫生應盡快安排相關化驗。

另外，就上周公布的一宗本地個案（涉及一名居於上環的23歲女子），流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。中心繼續呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會繼續接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過於上環文娛中心正門入口處設立的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於上述受影響地區進行上門探訪，為逾2 700名在當區工作或居住的市民進行評估，而過去四日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為兩名早前出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，全部樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

Quarterly business receipts indices for service industries for third quarter of 2025,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900525.htm,"  Business receipts in value terms of many major service industries showed increases of varying magnitudes in the third quarter of 2025 when compared with the third quarter of 2024, according to the provisional figures of business receipts indices released today (December 9) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  Comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the third quarter of 2024, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the insurance (+40.7%), financing (except banking) (+31.4%), import/export trade (+24.5%) and banking (+12.9%) industries. On the other hand, the transportation industry recorded a decrease of 5.8% in business receipts index during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 99.1% year-on-year during the same period, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 4.6% year-on-year.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, business receipts in value terms of many major service industries recorded increases of varying magnitudes in the third quarter of 2025 when compared with the second quarter of 2025. In particular, a double-digit increase was recorded in business receipts index of the insurance (+23.9%) industry. On the other hand, business receipts index of the warehousing and storage industry decreased by 5.6% during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the second quarter of 2025 on a seasonally adjusted basis, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 20.0%, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 6.8%.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business receipts of many service industries increased in the third quarter of 2025 over a year earlier, with more notable increases seen for the insurance, financing (except banking), import/export trade and banking industries.

  Looking ahead, business of the service industries as a whole should continue to expand. Sustained moderate growth of the global economy, coupled with easing China-US trade tensions, should provide support to trade-related sectors. Continued improvement in local consumer sentiment, sustained growth in visitor arrivals, vibrant financial market activities, and the Government's various measures to develop the economy and diversify markets will continue to bode well for various service industries. Notwithstanding, the impact of external uncertainties on certain industries still warrants close attention.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the business receipts indices and their corresponding year-on-year rates of change in respect of selected service industries and service domains for the recent five quarters, while Table 2 shows the corresponding quarter-to-quarter rates of change in the business receipts indices for the recent five quarters based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The revised figures of business receipts indices for the third quarter of 2025 will be released at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=660-69001) on January 19, 2026.

  Data for compiling the business receipts indices are mainly based on the Quarterly Survey of Service Industries conducted by the C&SD, supplemented by relevant data provided by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

  A service domain differs from a service industry in that it comprises those economic activities which straddle different industries but are somehow related to a common theme. It may include all activities carried out by all companies in a service industry that is closely related to the domain. For a service industry that is less closely related, however, only a portion of the companies in the industry or even only part of the economic activities of the companies is related to the domain. Taking the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain as an example, it includes all services of convention and exhibition organisers, short-term accommodation services and services of travel agents, and some of the services (only those involving visitors as customers) of restaurants, retailers and transport operators.

  The classification of service industries follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into relevant industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""Quarterly Business Receipts Indices for Service Industries, Third Quarter 2025"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520).

External Direct Investment of Hong Kong in 2024,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900320.htm,"  Hong Kong's external direct investment (DI) statistics for 2024 were released today (December 9) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

Stocks of DI

  At the end of 2024, the total stock of Hong Kong's inward DI (i.e. the position of Hong Kong's DI liabilities) increased by 9.1% over a year earlier to $20,049.6 billion. Its ratio to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stood at 631% in 2024. The increase in 2024 was mainly attributable to the positive DI inflow to Hong Kong.

  As for the total stock of Hong Kong's outward DI (i.e. the position of Hong Kong's DI assets), it increased by 6.7% over 2023 to $18,890.0 billion. Its ratio to GDP was 595% in 2024. The increase in 2024 was mainly attributable to the positive DI outflow to enterprises outside Hong Kong, partly offset by the decrease resulting from exchange rate variations, as some DI assets are denominated in other currencies.

  Analysed by immediate source of investment, Chinese Mainland (the Mainland) and the British Virgin Islands (BVI) were the two largest sources for Hong Kong's inward DI, with a share of 32.7% and 30.4% respectively at end-2024. Analysed by major economic activity of Hong Kong enterprise groups (HKEGs) which had received inward DI, those engaged in investment and holding, real estate, professional and business services took up the largest share, at 68.2% at end-2024. This was followed by banking, at 11.0%; and import/export, wholesale and retail trades, at 10.5%.

  Analysed by immediate destination of investment, the Mainland and the BVI were also the two largest destinations for Hong Kong's outward DI, with a share of 52.1% and 27.6% respectively at end-2024. Analysed by major economic activity of HKEGs which had made outward DI, those engaged in investment and holding, real estate, professional and business services took up the largest share, at 78.8% at end 2024. This was followed by import/export, wholesale and retail trades, at 8.6%.

Flows of DI

  In 2024, total DI inflow amounted to $982.4 billion, larger than that of $954.9 billion in 2023. On the other hand, total DI outflow in 2024 amounted to $629.2 billion, smaller than that of $752.9 billion in 2023. Taking the inflow and outflow together, a net DI inflow of $353.2 billion was recorded in 2024.

  Analysed by immediate source of investment, the Mainland was the major source of Hong Kong's DI inflow in 2024, amounting to $466.0 billion. The BVI came next, at $237.0 billion. Analysed by major economic activity of HKEGs which had received DI inflow, those engaged in investment and holding, real estate, professional and business services attracted the largest amount in 2024, at $588.0 billion.

  Analysed by immediate destination of investment, the Mainland accounted for a predominant share of Hong Kong's DI outflow in 2024, at $372.9 billion. The BVI came next, at $198.9 billion. Analysed by major economic activity of HKEGs which had made DI outflow, those engaged in investment and holding, real estate, professional and business services took up the largest amount, at $452.9 billion.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that Hong Kong remains one of the world's major destinations for and sources of external DI. Total DI inflow and outflow continued to be significant in 2024, at $982.4 billion and $629.2 billion respectively. The stocks of overall inward and outward DI also increased further to $20,049.6 billion and $18,890.0 billion (631% and 595% of GDP) respectively at end-2024. These testify Hong Kong’s status as a prominent international centre for finance and commerce and a preferred base for multinational corporations, while also reflect strong global investor confidence in Hong Kong's economic prospects.

  Hong Kong's DI covers a large geographical spread and a wide range of economic activities, with the Mainland featuring prominently both as a source and as a destination. This underscores Hong Kong's pivotal roles as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"".

  The Government will continue to leverage on Hong Kong's unique advantages in fulfilling its role in connecting the Mainland with the world. Persistent efforts have been made in deepening Hong Kong's international connectivity on all fronts, and proactive measures have been taken in attracting more Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong as a platform to go global. The Government will also strengthen its policies for bringing in more strategic enterprises to set up in Hong Kong, thereby promoting high-quality development.

Further Information

  DI represents external investment in which an investor of an economy acquires a lasting interest and a significant degree of influence or an effective voice in the management of an enterprise located in another economy. For statistical purpose, an effective voice is taken as being equivalent to a holding of 10% or more of the voting power in an enterprise.

  According to the international statistical standards, the total stocks and flows of DI presented above are compiled based on the ""asset/liability principle"", while detailed DI figures analysed by country/territory and by major economic activity of HKEGs are based on the ""directional principle"". Owing to the adoption of different presentation principles, the total stocks and flows of DI are different from the sums of the detailed DI figures by country/territory or by major economic activity of HKEGs. However, the overall direct investment balance compiled from figures based on these two presentation principles respectively is the same.

  Tables 1 and 2 show the positions (i.e. stocks) and flows of inward DI in Hong Kong by selected major investor country/territory and by major economic activity of HKEGs respectively for 2023 and 2024. Similar statistics on outward DI from Hong Kong are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""External Direct Investment Statistics of Hong Kong 2024"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040003&scode=260).

二零二四年香港對外直接投資統計數字,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900327.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月九日）發表二零二四年香港對外直接投資統計數字。

直接投資存量

於二零二四年年底，香港外來直接投資總存量（即香港直接投資負債頭寸）較上年年底上升9.1%至200,496億元，相當於二零二四年本地生產總值的631%。二零二四年的升幅主要是由於該年內流入香港的直接投資錄得正數。

就香港向外直接投資總存量（即香港直接投資資產頭寸）而言，則較二零二三年年底上升6.7%至188,900億元，相當於二零二四年本地生產總值的595%。二零二四年的升幅主要是由於該年內流出往境外企業的直接投資錄得正數，而匯率波動導致的下跌則抵銷了部分的升幅，原因在於部分直接投資資產以其他貨幣計價。

按投資的直接來源地分析，中國內地（內地）及英屬維爾京群島是最大的兩個香港外來直接投資來源地，在二零二四年年底分別佔32.7%及30.4%。按有接受外來直接投資的香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析，從事投資及控股、地產、專業及商用服務的香港企業集團佔最大比重，在二零二四年年底達68.2%。其次為銀行，佔11.0%；以及進出口貿易、批發及零售，佔10.5%。

按投資的首個目的地分析，內地及英屬維爾京群島也是香港向外直接投資最大的兩個目的地，在二零二四年年底分別佔52.1%及27.6%。按有作出向外直接投資的香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析，從事投資及控股、地產、專業及商用服務的香港企業集團佔最大比重，在二零二四年年底達78.8%。其次為進出口貿易、批發及零售，佔8.6%。

直接投資流量

在二零二四年，直接投資總流入為9,824億元，多於二零二三年的9,549億元。另一方面，二零二四年的直接投資總流出為6,292億元，較二零二三年的7,529億元為少。把流入和流出一併計算，在二零二四年錄得3,532億元的直接投資淨流入。

按投資的直接來源地分析，內地是二零二四年香港直接投資流入的主要來源，達4,660億元。其次為英屬維爾京群島，有2,370 億元。按有接受直接投資流入的香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析，從事投資及控股、地產、專業及商用服務的香港企業集團，在二零二四年吸納了最多的直接投資流入，達5,880億元。

按投資的首個目的地分析，內地佔二零二四年香港直接投資流出的最大比重，達3,729億元。其次為英屬維爾京群島，有1,989 億元。按有作出直接投資流出的香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析，從事投資及控股、地產、專業及商用服務的香港企業集團流出的直接投資最多，達4,529億元。

評論

政府發言人表示，香港仍然是全球其中一個主要對外直接投資目的地及來源地，二零二四年繼續錄得龐大的直接投資總流入和總流出，分別達9,824億元和6,292億元。外來直接投資和向外直接投資總存量亦進一步增加，截至二零二四年年底分別達200,496億元及188,900億元（相當於本地生產總值的631%及595%）。這印證香港作為主要國際金融和商業中心的地位，以及跨國企業的首選據點，並反映全球投資者對香港經濟前景充滿信心。

香港的對外直接投資涵蓋廣闊地域及多種經濟活動，其中內地是香港對外直接投資的重要來源地及目的地。這突顯香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要角色。

政府將繼續利用香港的獨特優勢發揮「內聯外通」的角色，持續全方位深化香港的國際聯繫，並積極採取措施吸引更多內地企業以香港作為平台出海。政府亦會加強政策，吸引更多策略性企業落戶香港，促進高質量發展。

其他資料

直接投資是指某經濟體的投資者對另一經濟體內的企業所作的對外投資，並對該企業擁有持久利益及在其管理上具有相當程度的影響力或話語權。就統計計算而言，若投資者持有某企業10%或以上的表決權，便視作對該企業的管理具話語權。

根據國際統計標準，上述的直接投資總存量及流量數字是按「資產／負債原則」編製，而按國家／地區及按香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析的直接投資詳細數字則按「方向原則」編製。由於採用了不同的展示原則，直接投資總存量及流量與按國家／地區或按香港企業集團的主要經濟活動劃分的直接投資詳細數字的總和有所不同。然而，根據這兩種展示原則各自編製的數字所得出的整體直接投資差額是相同的。

二零二三年及二零二四年按選定主要投資者國家／地區及按香港企業集團的主要經濟活動劃分的香港外來直接投資頭寸（即存量）及流量的數字，分別載列於表一及表二。而香港向外直接投資的相應統計數字則載列於表三及表四。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for November 2025,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900342.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (December 9) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for November 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs decreased from 44.8 in October 2025 in the contractionary zone to 44.5 in November 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. December 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 47.5. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts for some surveyed sectors dropped in November 2025 as compared with previous month, particularly for the logistics (from 43.3 to 42.2) and import and export trades (from 45.7 to 44.7).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades decreased from 47.1 in October 2025 to 46.0 in November 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. December 2025) was 47.4.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs was broadly stable in November after having shown some visible improvement over the past several months. While the current diffusion index on business receipts eased slightly from the high in the preceding month, the index on outlook in one month's time stayed at an elevated level. Meanwhile, the overall employment situation improved slightly from the preceding month.

  Looking ahead, further solid growth of the Hong Kong economy will support local business sentiment. Nevertheless, as the uncertainties in the external environment persist, the Government will monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to companies with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent companies in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own companies rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

二零二五年十一月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900306.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月九日）發表二零二五年十一月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年十月在收縮區域的44.8下跌至二零二五年十一月的44.5，而未來一個月（即二零二五年十二月）的業務收益展望動向指數為47.5。按行業分析，一些統計調查涵蓋的行業的業務收益現時動向指數在二零二五年十一月較上月下跌，特別是物流業（從43.3下跌至42.2）及進出口貿易業（從45.7下跌至44.7）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年十月的47.1下跌至二零二五年十一月的46.0，而未來一個月（即二零二五年十二月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.4。

評論

政府發言人表示，繼在過去數月錄得明顯改善後，十一月中小企的營商氣氛大致平穩。雖然業務收益的現時動向指數從上月高位輕微下跌，但展望未來一個月情況的指數保持在高位。與此同時，整體就業情況較上月輕微改善。

展望未來，香港經濟進一步穩健增長會支持本地營商氣氛。惟外圍環境的不確定因素仍在，政府會密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指從業人數少於50人的公司。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於規模較大的公司的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己公司情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

二零二五年第三季服務行業按季業務收益指數,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900346.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月九日）發表的業務收益指數的臨時數字顯示，二零二五年第三季與二零二四年第三季比較，不少主要服務行業以價值計算的業務收益均有不同程度的升幅。

二零二五年第三季與二零二四年第三季比較，保險業（+40.7%）、金融業（銀行除外）（+31.4%）、進出口貿易業（+24.5%）及銀行業（+12.9%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，運輸業的業務收益指數同期則下跌5.8%。

按服務界別分析，電腦及資訊科技服務界別的業務收益指數同期按年上升99.1%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別的業務收益指數亦按年上升4.6%。

二零二五年第三季與二零二五年第二季比較，不少主要服務行業經季節性調整的業務收益（以價值計算）均錄得不同程度的升幅。當中，保險業（+23.9%）的業務收益指數錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，貨倉及倉庫業的業務收益指數同期則下跌5.6%。

按服務界別分析，二零二五年第三季與二零二五年第二季比較，電腦及資訊科技服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數上升20.0%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數亦上升6.8%。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第三季不少服務行業的業務收益較去年同期上升，其中保險業、金融業（銀行除外）、進出口貿易業及銀行業的升幅較為顯著。

展望未來，整體服務行業的業務應會繼續擴張。環球經濟維持溫和增長，加上中美貿易緊張局勢緩和，應會為貿易相關的行業提供支持。本地消費氣氛繼續改善、訪港旅客人次持續增長、金融市場活動暢旺，以及政府多項發展經濟及開拓多元化市場的措施，將繼續惠及各個服務行業。然而，外部不確定性對個別行業的影響仍需密切關注。

進一步資料

表1載列最近五季選定服務行業及服務界別的業務收益指數及其相應按年變動百分率，而表2則載列最近五季經季節性調整的業務收益指數按季變動百分率。

二零二五年第三季的業務收益指數的修訂數字將於二零二六年一月十九日在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/web_table.html?id=660-69001）發布。

編製業務收益指數所用的數據主要來自政府統計處進行的「服務行業按季統計調查」，並輔以香港金融管理局及香港旅遊發展局提供的有關數據。

服務界別有別於服務行業，前者包括橫跨不同行業但與某個共同主題相關的經濟活動。服務界別可能包括某個服務行業內所有公司進行的全部經濟活動，而該服務行業與該服務界別關係密切。然而，在一個與該服務界別關係不太密切的服務行業內，只有部分公司甚或只有這些公司的部分經濟活動是與該服務界別有關。以旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別為例，這界別包括所有會議展覽機構的服務、短期住宿服務及旅行社所提供的服務，以及食肆、零售商及運輸服務營辦商的部分服務（只包括以旅客為對象的服務）。

服務行業的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各類經濟統計調查，把經濟單位分類歸入合適的行業類別。

Speech by SCST at Jockey Club HKCGI Sports Governance Programme: International Symposium on Sports Governance and Integrity (English only),2025-12-09 15:48,2025-12-09 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900548.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the Jockey Club HKCGI (Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute) Sports Governance Programme: International Symposium on Sports Governance and Integrity today (December 9):

Winfried (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges), Moray (Executive Director of Security, Integrity and Information Security of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Moray Taylor-Smith), David (President of the Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute, Mr David Simmonds), Irene (Assistant Director of Corruption Prevention of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), Ms Irene Wang), Edgar (Honorary Secretary General of the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC), Mr Edgar Yang), friends from the sports sector, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon and good to see you all here today.

It has been a difficult two weeks for Hong Kong, as we collectively and gradually come out of the haze of the Tai Po fire. In times like these, it is vital for our entire community to join the Government in providing every possible support to those affected. So I must start by acknowledging the Hong Kong Jockey Club for its generous donation through the Jockey Club Emergency Relief Fund and for pledging the gross income of its November 30 race meeting to the Hong Kong Government's support fund. I also hope that the sports sector can contribute positive energy to help Hong Kong through this period.

As our Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, has stated, the Government is committed to investigating the causes of this incident and addressing the issues that it has raised across multiple fronts. Systemic reform is essential - not only in response to this tragedy, but as a principle that we must uphold in all areas of public service.

Supporting systemic reform in any organisation begins with what we term a ""good design of top-level governance structure"", for those who know Cantonese, éå±¤è¨­è¨çé«å¶å»ºè¨­. Within such a structure, principles like ""governance"" and ""integrity"" are not just important - they are indispensable. They are key to delivering results, ensuring accountability, and achieving long-term success. It is precisely for these reasons that governance within the sports sector has been a priority of mine since I assumed the role of the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism a year ago - in fact, it is this very topic that I addressed in one of my first speeches in this position.

In my remarks today, I will first outline why governance is so important from a policy perspective, then share what we have been doing to strengthen it, and finally touch on the path ahead.

First, good governance ensures integrity and accountability. A sound governance framework guides how organisations make critical decisions and establishes appropriate checks and balances. It helps build a healthy ecosystem for the sports sector, enabling national sports associations, NSAs in short, to modernise their management and operations, and to grow sustainably. As the Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute aptly states in its purpose: ""Better governance leading to better decisions for a better world"". This succinctly captures the objective of upholding strong governance.

Second, good governance fosters professionalism and impartiality. Put simply, it ensures NSAs always act in the best interests of their organisations and athletes. Senior executives must place the organisation's mission above any personal interests. This is especially important in areas such as athlete selection for representing the Hong Kong, China team - a process that, when conducted fairly, helps elevate overall athletic performance.

Third, good governance ensures public funds are used effectively and responsibly. To provide context, in the 2025-26 financial year, the budget for sports development exceeds HK$9 billion - more than double the amount from a decade ago. Of this, over HK$1 billion is dedicated to elite sports development. We have a duty to ensure that public money is spent wisely and productively. As we consider how to increase investment in sports development, a robust governance framework is an essential prerequisite. We could not possibly allocate precious additional resources to NSAs unless we are confident that there is satisfactory governance. To put it bluntly, pouring good money after bad is never an option.

Fourth, we should aspire to be a global standard-setter in sports governance. This is no small ambition. But as a modern society that takes pride in its rule of law and professional services - including the governance experts here today - I believe we should aim high.

Now let me turn to what the Government has done to promote governance in the sports sectors.

In recent years, the sports sector in Hong Kong has embarked on an important journey to enhance transparency, accountability, integrity and operational efficiency. In November 2024, under the steer of the Government, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China completed a comprehensive review of NSA operations and corporate governance standards. I would like to thank the ""three wise men"" - Dr York Chow, Mr KS Tang (Mr Tang King-shing) and Mr CN Ma (Mr Ma Ching-nam), who I believe are with us today - for their invaluable guidance throughout this process.

The SF&OC has since promulgated a code of practice covering board governance, integrity management, athlete selection, coach and umpire management, membership administration, and general administration.

Over the past year, the SF&OC has worked diligently with NSAs and key stakeholders, including the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute and the ICAC, to implement this code in full.

Some NSAs are further along in achieving full compliance than others, and I expect these NSAs to set an example for others to follow. The SF&OC has also enlisted pro bono legal support from the Law Society of Hong Kong to assist NSAs with code-related legal matters. I am also very pleased to note that the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the HKCGI will soon launch a Sports Governance Programme to equip NSA officers and executives with essential governance skills.

Ladies and gentlemen, what we are witnessing is a true team effort - one that demonstrates our shared determination to modernise Hong Kong's sports sector through updated governance practices. This will not only benefit our athletes and support the professional, sustainable development of sports, but also strengthen Hong Kong's influence in the global sports arena.

Before I conclude, I would like to thank the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the HKCGI for echoing the Government's call to enhance the corporate governance in sports. I am most encouraged by today's symposium, such a big turnout, and its excellent lineup of local and international speakers.

The SF&OC and our NSAs are entrusted with significant and exciting responsibilities in advancing sports development in Hong Kong. Their professionalism, competence and capability have never been more important. This symposium is only the beginning of a series of programmes, and I look forward to your continued support.

I wish you all a fruitful day filled with inspiration and meaningful exchange.

Thank you."

日本進口水產的檢測情況,2025-12-09 15:36,2025-12-09 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900550.htm,"因應日本政府單方面決定把福島核電站核污水排放大海，食物環境衞生署署長已發出《食物安全命令》，禁止源自日本10（都）縣的水產、海鹽和海藻食品進口本港，受禁（都）縣包括東京、福島、茨城、宮城、千葉、群馬、栃木、新潟、長野和埼玉。

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由十二月八日中午截至今日（十二月九日）中午，食安中心已對162個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對50個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

由二○二三年八月二十四日起至今日中午，食安中心及漁護署分別檢測了共186 708個日本進口食物樣本（包括121 140個水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽樣本）及共41 614個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。"
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-12-09 15:36,2025-12-09 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900551.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 8 to noon today (December 9), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 162 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 186 708 samples of food imported from Japan (including 121 140 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 41 614 samples of local catch respectively.

Public consultation on implementation of Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework and amendments in relation to Common Reporting Standard launched,2025-12-09 15:00,2025-12-09 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900283.htm,"The Government today (December 9) launched a public consultation on the implementation of the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and amendments in relation to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) promulgated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong has long been supportive of international efforts to enhance tax transparency and combat cross-border tax evasion. Since 2018, Hong Kong has been exchanging financial account information automatically with partner jurisdictions on an annual basis in accordance with the CRS developed by the OECD, which enables the relevant tax authorities to utilise such information for tax assessments, as well as for detecting and combating tax evasion.

In light of the rapid development of digital asset markets in recent years, in 2023, the OECD published CARF to provide for the automatic exchange of tax information on crypto-asset transactions with partner jurisdictions on an annual basis, and incorporated into the CRS new digital financial products and enhanced requirements regrading reporting and due diligence.

The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said,""To demonstrate our commitment to promoting international tax co-operation and combating cross-border tax evasion, as well as to fulfil our international obligations, Hong Kong will make amendments to the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (the Ordinance) for implementing CARF and the newly amended CRS. This is also of paramount importance in maintaining Hong Kong's reputation as an international financial and commercial centre.

""The Government plans to complete the necessary local legislative amendments in the coming year, with a view to commencing the automatic exchange of tax information on crypto-asset transactions with relevant partner jurisdictions starting from 2028, and implementing the newly amended CRS starting from 2029. Hong Kong will implement the automatic exchange of tax information with suitable partners, which are required to meet the standards relating to the protection of data confidentiality and security, on a reciprocal basis.""

In addition, since 2024, the OECD has been conducting the second round of a peer review on the effectiveness of Hong Kong's administrative framework for implementing the CRS. Having taken into consideration the OECD's views, the Government proposes, through amendments to the Ordinance, to introduce mandatory registration for financial institutions to enhance identification, as well as to raise the penalty levels and enhance the enforcement mechanism, in order to maintain a favourable rating in the OECD's peer reviews and maintain Hong Kong's reputation as an international financial and commercial centre.

The consultation paper is available on the website of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (www.fstb.gov.hk/tb/en/others/consultation.htm). It outlines CARF and the newly amended CRS promulgated by the OECD, and sets out in detail the abovementioned legislative proposals and relevant implementation matters (including reporting procedures, record-keeping requirements, penalty levels and enforcement, etc). Members of the public are welcome to forward their views on the proposals by post (24/F, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong) or email (carf@fstb.gov.hk) by February 6, 2026."
政府就實施加密資產申報框架和與共同匯報標準有關修訂展開公眾諮詢,2025-12-09 15:00,2025-12-09 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900284.htm,"政府今日（十二月九日）就在香港實施經濟合作及發展組織（經合組織）頒布的加密資產申報框架和與共同匯報標準有關的修訂展開公眾諮詢。

香港一直支持國際間提升稅務透明度及打擊跨境逃稅的工作。自二○一八年起，香港按經合組織制定的共同匯報標準，每年與夥伴稅務管轄區自動交換財務帳戶資料，讓相關稅務當局可運用該等資料作稅務評估，以及偵查和打擊逃稅。

隨着數碼資產市場近年急促發展，經合組織於二○二三年公布申報框架，讓夥伴稅務管轄區每年自動交換與加密資產交易相關的稅務資料，以及將新數碼金融產品及優化的申報及盡職審查規定納入共同匯報標準。

財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇表示：「為展現香港致力推動國際稅務合作及打擊跨境逃稅的決心，履行國際義務，我們會修訂《稅務條例》（第112章）（《條例》）以實施申報框架及新修訂的共同匯報標準。這舉措亦對維持香港作為國際金融和商業中心的聲譽至為重要。」

「政府計劃明年內完成所需的本地立法修訂，目標是從二○二八年起與相關夥伴稅務管轄區自動交換與加密資產交易相關的稅務資料，以及由二○二九年起實施新修訂的共同匯報標準。香港會在互惠原則下與合適夥伴自動交換稅務資料，當中，夥伴須符合與保障資料保密和安全相關的標準。」

此外，經合組織自二○二四年起就香港落實共同匯報標準的行政框架的成效展開第二輪成員相互評估。考慮過經合組織的意見後，政府建議透過修訂《條例》，強制申報財務機構登記以加強識辨，並提高罰則及優化執法機制，以期在經合組織成員相互評估中維持良好評級，鞏固香港作為國際金融和商業中心的聲譽。

諮詢文件已上載財經事務及庫務局網頁（www.fstb.gov.hk/tb/tc/others/consultation.htm）。文件介紹經合組織頒布的申報框架及新修訂的共同匯報標準，並闡述上述立法建議的詳情及相關實施事宜（包括申報流程、備存紀錄要求、罰則及執法工作等）。歡迎公眾於二○二六年二月六日或以前，以郵寄（香港添馬添美道2號政府總部24樓）或電郵（carf@fstb.gov.hk）方式，就各項建議提交意見。"

Speech by STL at Airspace Asia Pacific 2025,2025-12-09 12:46,2025-12-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900338.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Airspace Asia Pacific 2025 today (December 9):

Mr Hocquard (Director General of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), Mr Simon Hocquard), Mr Han (Director-General of theCivil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Chair of the Asia Pacific CANSO, Mr Han Kok-juan), Mr Arel (Chair of CANSO, Mr Tim Arel), Messrs Ma (Deputy Administrator of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), Mr Ma Bing, and Regional Director of Asia Pacific Office, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Mr Ma Tao), Mr Miao (Director-General of the Air Traffic Management Bureau of the CAAC, Mr Miao Xuan), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning, and to our friends from abroad, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong. It is my great honour to address the CANSO Airspace Asia Pacific 2025. With our prime location right at the heart of Asia, half of the world's population are within five hours by air. Not to mention as a premier southern gateway to the world's second largest economy - the Chinese Mainland - Hong Kong is truly the perfect place to host this remarkable event.

Backed by firm national support and strong global connectivity, Hong Kong is widely recognised as an international aviation hub. Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is a world leader in air cargo and a top international passenger airport. Last year, it handled 53 million passengers, an increase of one-third year-on-year, ranked among the top 10 busiest international passenger airports in the world. Over the first 10 months this year, HKIA already handled over 50 million passengers, representing 15 per cent growth compared to the same period last year. Cargo volume rose by 2.3 per cent year-on-year to over 4.1 million tonnes. Currently, about 140 airlines are operating, connecting us to over 200 destinations around the world. I'm very happy to say today that HKIA is just named by the 2025 World Travel Awards as the world's leading airport in terms of customer experience.

As we have turned our dual-runway into a three-runway system, we are accelerating the expansion of the aviation network. Over the past two years, we have expanded bilateral air services agreements with more than 10 countries. I am happy to tell you that just the past two months, we have managed to strike deals and detailed agreements with a handful of South American countries, namely Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Cuba, as well as Poland in Europe and Togo in West Africa. These are all countries in our major aviation partner network, including under the Belt and Road Initiative. In a way, we hope that we will extend our air connectivity to support our business and tourism sectors when dealing with all these countries.

While managing the very busy high-altitude air traffic, we are also actively exploring the opportunities presented by emerging unmanned air mobility technologies flying at the low altitude. As one of the themes of this conference, ""Seamless Airspace: Integrating Manned, Uncrewed, and Advanced Air Mobility"" is a powerful reflection of both the dynamic skies around the world. Today, allow me to take you through our journey of turning this vision of seamless integration from concept into tangible reality.

In Hong Kong, a city known for its ambition and innovation, we are building a new layer of intelligent, connected infrastructure in the airspace below 1 000 metres. We recognise that the low-altitude economy (LAE) is a very powerful convergence of aviation, digitalisation and green technology. But its success hinges on one critical factor: the safe, efficient and scalable integration of new air mobility technologies and solutions into our existing airspace system.

Our strategy to achieve this is built on a disciplined, three-phase approach, and together we mapped out a roadmap that helps us to move from very controlled testing scenarios to real-life, full-scale applications.

First, we began with conceptualisation and proof of concept. In March this year, we launched our LAE ""Regulatory Sandbox"". This initiative marked our practical starting point for integration, inviting enterprises, technology and academic institutions to establish very tightly and well-managed controlled corridors to test real-world applications. The initial results are very promising just over the past nine months. To name a few:


We have achieved a groundbreaking 18-minute cross-sea medical delivery by drone, cutting delivery time by over 60 per cent and proving the efficiency of unmanned logistics.
Partners like the MTR Corporation (MTR Corporation Limited) are integrating and implementing AI-enabled drone systems for railway infrastructure maintenance, surveillance, and preventive maintenance. In a way, they are creating a smart eye in the sky that enhances both safety and efficiency.
Crucially, over a dozen government departments are already adopting low-altitude economy applications by using drones, embedding this new opportunity into the fabric of public services and urban management.


These are not isolated trials. They are the fundamental and foundational steps in helping us to build trust, reliability and operational data for a shared airspace.

Second, we are now advancing to consolidation and complex integration through the LAE ""Regulatory Sandbox X"" scheme, which was just launched two weeks ago. ""X"" in the project's name denotes extra complexity and extended scale, so it is really limitless opportunities. Directly aligned with CANSO's theme, this phase deliberately introduces more sophisticated integration scenarios. We are heading to more challenging scenarios like cross-boundary logistics, using heavier drones and even passenger-carrying drones. Our focus will be on the key modules including an unmanned aircraft traffic management system, eVTOLs and an integrated platform.

The fundamental objective of this phase is to address a critical question before us: What creates outsized economic value while maintaining acceptable risk? It serves as our practical, real-world laboratory for pioneering the harmonisation of both air traffic and unmanned air traffic management system.

And ultimately, our path leads to a codified action plan. By the end of next year, the data and experience from these two phases of ""Regulatory Sandbox"" schemes will help us to culminate data into a comprehensive action plan. Underpinning this roadmap are two essential enablers.

First, an adaptive regulatory framework. We have actually, with the help of the past Legislative Council, already started our legislative amendment exercise. We will also embark on an exercise to map out a dedicated law to enable us to advance to a more complex and integrated low-altitude air traffic management and safety system. Compliance is our top priority. It is a guardrail from the start and absolutely will not be a checkpoint at the end. With the successful implementation of the Legislative Council General Election, we are here to work closely with our new elected Legislative Councillors in partnership so as to advance and expedite our law amendment exercise.

The second enabler is a collaborative ecosystem for regional leadership. Seamless airspace cannot be achieved in isolation. Hong Kong, with our strengths as an international financial centre and a hub for legal and insurance services, is mobilising our capital and risk-management expertise in order to provide solutions for the entire industry. Furthermore, our position in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of the Chinese Mainland gives us unrivalled access to world-class manufacturing and R&D (research and development) hubs. This synergy between Hong Kong's international standards and the region's innovation capacity creates a perfect launchpad for the low-altitude economy. We are actively engaging in global standard-setting technologies and dialogues, including those with ICAO, to ensure the frameworks we develop contribute to regional and global harmonisation.

Ladies and gentlemen, our journey follows a simple, evidence-based cadence: plan, test, learn and decide. We are building more than a low-altitude economy; we are building a blueprint for the seamless, safe, innovative and efficient airspace of the future - not just locally, but globally.

Hong Kong is fully committed to collaborating with all of you - our partners across the Asia-Pacific region and the world - to ensure that our skies remain a realm of limitless opportunities. Together, we will pioneer an airspace where manned and unmanned vehicles integrate seamlessly and safely, fuelling economic growth and connecting our communities in once unimaginable ways.

Thank you again, and I wish you a very fruitful, positive and collaborative conference today. Thank you very much."

William (Chairperson of the Advisory Board of the HKUST Li & Fung Supply Chain Institute, Dr William Fung), Victor (Chairman of Fung Investments, Dr Victor Fung), distinguished guests, friends and partners, ladies and gentlemen,

 Thank you for inviting me to this year's annual conference under the theme ""Reinvention of global supply chains"". I am joining you today as we explore the far-reaching transformations shaping global supply chains, the strategic responses from governments and businesses, and the exciting opportunities these changes present, especially for Hong Kong.

 Let me begin by expressing my sincere appreciation to the Fung Group and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for organising this high-level event and bringing together such an esteemed gathering of thought leaders, academics, and industry professionals.

Shifting global supply chain

 The global supply chain landscape is undergoing profound change, driven by several forces. Chief among them is the shifting geopolitical environment. While trade tensions between China and the United States have moderated somewhat in recent months, we must acknowledge that structural changes in their trade relationship are now deeply embedded in the global system.

 Despite a growing call for onshoring and nearshoring in developed markets, China's enduring competitive strengths ensure its continued centrality in global supply chains. Our country has maintained its position as the world's largest manufacturing economy for 15 consecutive years, commanding close to30 per cent of global manufacturing output. China possesses a comprehensive manufacturing system that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere.

 Meanwhile, regional trade co-operation is accelerating. A prime example is China's deepening economic ties with Southeast Asia. In 2024, intermediate goods made up around 67 per cent of the trade between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Total trade reached a record US$860 billion in the first 10 months of 2025, an increase of more than eight per cent year-on-year. Supply chain reconfiguration is taking place, but it is creatingcomplementary, not competitionacross the Asia-Pacific region.

 Hong Kong, as a key re-export hub, has witnessed substantial growth in this business. Our merchandise exports have recordedgrowth for 20 consecutive months, rising byover 13 per cent year-on-yearin value during the first 10 months of 2025. More significantly,exports to the Chinese Mainland increased by over 15 per cent, and to ASEAN by over 30 per cent.

 This trend will continue in the foreseeable future. China will continue to advance its agenda of high-quality development. The recent Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has laid out comprehensive recommendations for the nation's 15th Five-Year Plan, reaffirming China's commitment tohigh-level two-way opening up. A significant part of it is to strengthen economic co-operation and supply and industry chain collaboration with Belt and Road countries and the Global South at large.

 Another major force driving supply chain transformation is the growing importance of sustainability and technology. Global regulatory requirements and consumer expectations around carbon neutrality are reshaping production and logistics. Manufacturers are being called upon to meet stringent environmental standards, requiring significant investment and innovation.

 Simultaneously, technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and materials science are revolutionising production processes. These innovations support more customised, localised manufacturing models that reduce reliance on long and complex supply chains.

 In this evolving environment, the question naturally arises: What is Hong Kong's strategic role? The answer lies in our unique position and competitive advantages. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys the best of both worlds: convenient and sometimes priority access to the Mainland's vast market, and seamless connectivity with the rest of the world.

 Despite geopolitical uncertainties, Hong Kong continues to be a free port, maintaining the free movement of goods, capital, information and people. Our common law system, sound regulatory environment, low and simple tax regime, and freely convertible currency create a robust and stable foundation for international business.

 Hong Kong is well-positioned to become a hub in the reconfiguration of global supply chains, especially as Chinese enterprises expand into Southeast Asia, the Middle East and the Global South. We provide comprehensive financial, legal, advisory, logistics, and strategic support services.

 Hong Kong is increasingly recognised by Chinese enterprises asthe essential platform for establishing regional and global headquarters, fund-raising, trade financing, corporate treasury management, ESG (environmental, social and governance) compliance, offshore trading, R&D (research and development), and much more.

 A vivid example is CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited), the world's largest IPO (initial public offering) this year, which raised capital in Hong Kong to support its expansion in Hungary. It has also established a global R&D centre here in this city. Increasingly, Mainland enterprises are following this path. In fact, over 300 Mainland companies are currently in the IPO pipeline, many of which plan to use Hong Kong as a strategic base for their overseas expansion.

 Building on this momentum, both the Policy Address and the Budget over the past two years have set out a clear strategic vision for Hong Kong to develop into a high value-added, multinational supply chain management centre.

 And this year, we are going further. We have established a GoGlobal Task Force (Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global), bringing together government departments and agencies like the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as well as relevant non-governmental organisations such as the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Productivity Council, to be more coordinated in attracting and assisting Mainland enterprises to expand internationally through Hong Kong.

 Measures include, for instance, encouraging Mainland banks to establish regional headquarters in Hong Kong to support Mainland firms entering Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern markets; offering tax concessions to attract more Mainland companies to set up corporate treasury centres here; and promoting carbon auditing services, to help companies meet growing sustainability requirements.

 Looking ahead, I believe there is more Hong Kong can do in supporting or even driving supply chain reconfiguration.

 Our world-class financial institutions are uniquely positioned to develop innovative financing tools tailored for modern supply chains. These include advanced trade finance solutions, such as blockchain-based trade finance platforms that are already reducing transaction times, lowering counterparty risk, and improving transparency.

 A good example is Project CargoX, launched earlier this year by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority together with public and private sector partners. It is an initiative that leverages cargo data to streamline trade finance processes. It is now exploring partnerships with international data providers to support cross-border trade financing use cases.

 Other areas include ESG-linked lending, green bonds and other financial instruments that help support regional supply chain initiatives.

 At the same time, many start-ups from Hong Kong and the Mainland are leading in areas such as AI-driven logistics optimisation and IoT (Internet of things)-enabled supply chain visibility. Hong Kong's international business and regulatory environment provides a fertile testing ground for these cutting-edge technologies, and a global showcase for their capabilities.

 With these strengths, Hong Kong has great potential to become a global leader in next-generation supply chain solutions.

Concluding remarks

 Ladies and gentlemen, this conference brings together some of the most insightful minds and influential leaders from Hong Kong, the Mainland and around the world.

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-08 22:40,2025-12-08 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800940.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3 billion as of noon today (December 8). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.3 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

  The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance to each affected household. As of today, 1 357 cases have been processed. The living allowance is increased from $50,000 to $100,000 and will be disbursed in phases. In addition, the Support Fund will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 95 cases have been processed.

  In addition, the Government has so far disbursed an emergency subsidy of $10,000 to 1 932 households, and the relevant disbursement is largely complete.

  Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 970 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. SWD staff also paid visits to the affected residents staying in transitional housing units in Yuen Long today and distributed Octopus cards with a face value of $2,000 to facilitate their daily travels and address their imminent needs. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

  As of this morning, a total of 1 422 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 2 522 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Moreover, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 600 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 5 700 pieces of donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Handling of reported missing persons
------------------------------------------

  Officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit continued to search the area around the buildings and near the collapsed scaffolding today, which had been confirmed as safe. No human remains were found, and the number of deceased remains at 159. The Police have contacted the families of the missing persons and those who have preliminarily identified the deceased through photographs to arrange for them to undergo DNA oral swab sampling in batches starting today for scientific identification of the deceased.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

  The emergency maintenance contractors co-ordinated by the Housing Department have completed the clearance of the miscellaneous items at the surroundings of the buildings at Wang Fuk Court today. The Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau also continued to extract concrete core samples from the affected buildings today. So far, five buildings have been covered.

  The ICU has conducted inspections on the scaffoldings of the four Home Ownership Scheme courts, namely Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme. Miscellaneous items were found on some scaffoldings. The contractor is removing the items. The ICU will closely monitor the progress.

  Regarding the order to remove scaffold nets issued by the Buildings Department (BD), as of 5pm today, 227 private buildings have had their scaffold nets removed from the external walls (including two cases completed by government contractors). Work on the remaining three cases, in which the BD has accepted an extension of time, is underway and is expected to finish within this week.

  The BD is striving to announce a new set of arrangements within this week that will require scaffold nets used at construction sites to be sampled on-site and certified as compliant with the relevant standards prior to installation, so that the relevant external wall work can resume as soon as possible.

  The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 351 construction sites, issued a total of 180 written warnings and 96 improvement notices, and has taken out 25 prosecutions."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-08 22:30,2025-12-08 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800927.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月八日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得78宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，10宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

鑑於近期部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。中心繼續呼籲近期曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。熱線會繼續由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心在上月底亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

另外，就日前公布的一宗本地個案（涉及一名居於上環的23歲女子），流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

中心繼續呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會繼續接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過於上環文娛中心正門入口處設立的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於上述受影響地區進行上門探訪，為逾2 700名在當區工作或居住的市民進行評估，而過去三日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為兩名早前出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，全部樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。鑑於近日僅有零星市民前往醫護站，加上全部於上述醫護站接受抽血檢查的人士結果均為陰性，相關醫護站將由明日起停止運作。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-08 22:30,2025-12-08 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800928.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 8), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 78 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 10 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  As some confirmed CF cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. The CHP continued to urge individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which was set up earlier. The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. In late November, the CHP also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department and Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

   Meanwhile, regarding the recently announced local case involving a23-year-old female living in Sheung Wan, the epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

  The CHP continued to urge the members of the public residing and working at Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. CHP officers continued to reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind individuals to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 2 700 individuals residing or working in the district through the health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre, its enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past three days. Two individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests. All tested negative for the chikungunya virus. Since the health consultation booth has only sporadic visits recently and all individuals who underwent blood tests have returned negative results, the booth will cease operation starting tomorrow.

  Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected cannabis buds at airport (with photo),2025-12-08 21:56,2025-12-08 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800859.htm,"âHong Kong Customs yesterday (December 7) detected a drug trafficking case involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport and seized about 23 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $4.7 million. Two persons suspected to be connected with the case were arrested.

Two male passengers, aged 43 and 58, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds in the check-in suitcases possessed by them. The duo was subsequently arrested.

An investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
"DH continues to organise ""HIV Testing Month"" to promote normalisation of HIV testing",2025-12-08 21:37,2025-12-08 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800842.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (December 8) said that, with the concerted efforts of the government, the healthcare sector and non-governmental organisations, the prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection among the adult population in Hong Kong remains at 0.1 per cent, well below the global average, and the number of new HIV cases recorded also continues to decline for nine consecutive years since 2015, demonstrating the effectiveness of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) prevention and control in Hong Kong. Like last year, the DH launches ""HIV Testing Month 2025"" in December to raise public awareness and knowledge on prevention of HIV infection, and to promote normalisation of HIV testing.

The Government has attached great importance to HIV infection control and prevention. Since the first case of HIV infection reported in Hong Kong in 1984, the Government has adopted a multipronged approach to prevent and control AIDS, including the provision of free, anonymous and confidential HIV testing services to the public, and comprehensive risk assessment, counselling and support services to individuals undergoing testing. Although the prevalence of HIV infection in Hong Kong remains at a low level, the proportion of late presenters has been as high as 40 to 60 per cent in recent years. There was an even higher proportion of late presenters, up to 60 to 70 per cent, among those who do not belong to the high-risk populations.Those who do not belong to the high-risk populations may have overlooked that they still have the risk of HIV infection even though they do not have frequent high-risk sexual practices, leading to delayed testing and treatment.

The DH launched the inaugural ""HIV Testing Month"" last year in December. Around 40 per cent of the participants who received testing through various activities during the ""HIV Testing Month"" last year did not belong to the high-risk populations, and about 40 per cent were tested for the first time. Eight persons were confirmed to have HIV infection, including two late presenters. The campaign not only successfully links people who are unaware of their infection status to receive timely diagnosis and treatment, but also promotes normalisation of HIV testing that helps remove the stigma associated with HIV infection and testing. The DH encourages people who have had sex to undergo HIV testing at least once, especially individuals who do not belong to the high-risk populations. The DH emphasised that early testing allows individuals with HIV to promptly receive specialist care, and through antiretroviral therapy to achieve viral suppression and immune recovery, thereby preventing health deterioration.

""The DH, in collaboration with 26 collaborating and supporting organisations, continue to organise 'HIV Testing Month' in December this year, with a view to promoting the message 'For your health, Get tested for HIV' to more stakeholders and bodies in the community, as well as providing an enabling environment for members of the public to undergo HIV testing easily and conveniently through a variety of channels and testing modalities. Members of the public could order HIV self-test kits on the HIV Testing Service website with free shipping during the 'HIV Testing Month',"" said the Consultant (Special Preventive Programme) of the Public Health Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Bonnie Wong.

She added that the AIDS hotline (2780 2211)under the DH was operated by professionally trained nurses, offering behavioural risk assessment, counselling and arrangement of HIV antibody test. Members of the public who received HIV testing from non-government channels could also call the hotline for enquiries about follow-up or counselling services. Operating for 40 years, the AIDS hotline has received over 1 500 000 calls, provided over 500 000 counselling services, and conducted nearly 70 000 HIV antibody tests. It also features pre-recorded information in multiple languages on HIV/AIDS and sexual health for diverse ethnic groups.

Members of the public can browse the HIV Testing Service website (www.hivtest.gov.hk) to access the HIV testing calendar to learn more about and select testing resources in the community."

Court makes review decision on sentencing for violating occupational safety and health legislation,2025-12-08 19:17,2025-12-08 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800773.htm,"  âRegarding the sentencing in a fatal industrial accident, the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts today (December 8) handed down a review decision, accepting the prosecution's application for review of an earlier court sentence, increasing the fines imposed on the contractor and shortening the duration, with higher amounts for the monthly instalment of the fines.

  The case involved a fatal accident that occurred on May 7, 2022, at a residential unit under renovation in Jordan. A scaffolder, while preparing to erect a truss-out bamboo scaffold on an external wall, fell to the ground and died.

  The contractor was prosecuted by the Labour Department (LD) for the violation of the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations, and was fined $90,000 and allowed to pay the fines in 90 instalments of $1,000 per month at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on November 8, 2024.

  After the sentencing, the prosecution filed a review application with the court regarding the sentences imposed on the relevant contractor. The review hearing was brought up today before the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts. The fines imposed on the contractor were increased to $160,000 and were payable in 74 instalments of $2,000 per month after deducting the fine of $12,000 that has already been paid.

  A spokesman for the LD said that the ruling will disseminate a strong message to all contractors that they have to protect workers' safety and health at work in accordance with the laws. The prosecution will continue to pay attention to court rulings and will file review or appeal applications for cases where the sentences are manifestly inadequate and/or wrong in principle."
法庭就違反職安健法例的判刑作出覆核裁決,2025-12-08 19:17,2025-12-08 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800772.htm,"就一宗致命工業意外的判刑，觀塘裁判法院今日（十二月八日）頒布覆核裁決，接受控方就較早前法院判刑的覆核申請，提高承建商的罰款，並以一個期數較少而金額較高的方式分期繳付罰款。

衞生署續推「HIV測試月」　推動愛滋病病毒檢測普及化,2025-12-08 19:07,2025-12-08 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800760.htm,"衞生署今日（十二月八日）表示，在政府與醫護界和非政府組織的共同努力下，本港的愛滋病病毒（HIV）感染率一直遠低於全球平均水平，佔本港成年人口的千分之一，新增個案宗數亦自二○一五年起連續九年下跌，充分反映本港在愛滋病防控工作成效卓越。衞生署今年一如去年，於十二月推行「HIV測試月2025」，以提高公眾對預防HIV感染的關注和認識，促進HIV檢測普及化。

政府一向高度重視HIV感染的防控工作。香港自一九八四年呈報第一宗本地HIV感染個案以來，政府一直以多管齊下的方式應對預防及控制愛滋病，包括為市民提供免費、不記名和保密的HIV抗體測試服務，專業醫護人員亦會同時為接受測試者提供風險評估和心理輔導等全方位支援。雖然本港的HIV感染率持續處於低水平，但近年本港晚發現感染者比例偏高，約佔新感染個案的四至六成。非高風險人群的晚發現感染者比例更高，佔六至七成。非高風險人群可能誤以為沒有持續進行高風險性行為便不會感染，以至未有及時進行HIV檢測而延誤治療。

衞生署去年十二月首次推出「HIV測試月」，透過各項「HIV測試月」活動參與檢測的人士當中近四成為非高風險人群，亦有約四成參與人士是首次進行HIV檢測。八人證實感染HIV，當中兩人為晚發現感染者。活動除成功讓不清楚自身感染狀況的感染者及早接受診斷及治療外，亦推動檢測普及化，有助消除大眾對HIV感染及檢測的負面標籤。衞生署鼓勵曾進行性行為的人士，特別是非高風險人群，最少進行一次HIV檢測，並強調早測試有助受感染人士盡早接受愛滋病專科治理服務，以及透過接受抗愛滋病病毒藥物治療，更快達至抑制病毒及修復免疫系統、避免健康狀況惡化之效。

衞生署衞生防護中心公共衞生服務處顧問醫生（特別預防計劃）黃駿君醫生說：「衞生署今年再接再厲，於十二月聯同26間協辦和支持機構，繼續推動『HIV測試月』，將『HIV 測一次』的信息推廣至更多不同的社區持分者和群體，同時讓公眾透過更多不同途徑及檢測模式，輕鬆便捷地檢測愛滋病。市民於『HIV測試月』期間經HIV測試服務網站訂取HIV自我檢測套裝，可免運費。」

她補充，衞生署設有愛滋熱線2780 2211，由經過專業培訓的護士接聽，為來電者進行風險評估、心理輔導及預約抗體測試服務。市民如透過其他非政府渠道接受HIV抗體測試後，亦可致電熱線查詢後續跟進或接受心理輔導。熱線運作至今已40年，一共處理超過150萬個查詢、提供超過50萬次輔導服務，以及進行近七萬次HIV抗體測試。此外，熱線設有多語言預錄資料，讓不同族裔人士隨時查詢有關愛滋病及性健康資訊。

有興趣接受HIV檢測市民可瀏覽HIV測試服務網站（www.hivtest.gov.hk），連接到HIV測試服務網站的HIV測試月曆，了解及選擇社區上的測試資源。"
