尊敬的慎海雄台長（中央廣播電視總台台長兼總編輯）、尊敬的周霽主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任）、崔建春特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署特派員）、陳楓副署長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署副署長）、王兆兵副政委（中國人民解放軍駐香港部隊副政治委員）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好！我很高興今天出席《習近平的文化情緣》和《習近平經濟思想系列講讀》兩個節目在香港的啟播儀式，以及「紫荊綻放煥新篇——中央廣播電視總台與香港各界深化合作儀式」。首先，我熱烈歡迎慎海雄台長再次率團來到香港，並恭賀今天的啟播儀式和合作儀式順利舉行！

文化是國家的靈魂所繫，是民族團結的同心圓，是時代發展的血與脈。節目《習近平的文化情緣》透過實地探訪河北正定、福建廈門、浙江杭州、甘肅敦煌等習近平主席工作或考察過的地方，立體呈現習主席治國理政理念的深厚文化根基，同時讓香港市民加深認識中華民族源遠流長、兼收並蓄的文化底蘊，了解國家在文明探源、文化遺產保護等方面的努力。

習主席提出，我們要堅持把發展立足點放在高質量發展上，完整準確全面貫徹新發展理念，加快構建新發展格局，進一步全面深化改革，擴大高水平對外開放，推動經濟持續回升向好，保持社會和諧穩定。

今年是國家「十四五」規劃的收官之年，也是「十五五」規劃的謀篇布局之年。這次啟播的《習近平經濟思想系列講讀》節目，闡釋習主席的經濟思想內涵，以及關於推動高質量發展、新質生產力等重要論述，帶領觀眾了解國家經濟發展的戰略思維、牢記全面推進強國建設、實現民族復興的偉大使命。

中央廣播電視總台廣播覆蓋全國，全面報道國家各方面的最新發展，搭建起內地和香港民心相通的連心橋。總台的精彩節目幫助香港觀眾進一步了解國家發展的堅實步伐，為香港更好融入國家發展大局提供堅實的思想裝備。

今天，我們還將見證總台與香港有關體育、文化、旅遊等方面深化合作，結合兩地的傳播力量，助力推廣首次由廣東、香港、澳門共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，以及關於大熊貓文化、歷史文化等的主題活動和巡展，攜手推動兩地合作綻放精彩魅力。

我在今月發表的《施政報告》中，為香港主動對接國家發展戰略、實現突破新局面作出策略部署。《施政報告》強調，我們會發揮香港內聯外通的優勢服務國家，善用香港「出海」平台作用，攜手服務和引領更多企業「走出去」開拓全球業務。

特區政府將繼續與中央廣播電視總台全力合作，把香港「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢與總台覆蓋海內外的強大傳播力對接起來，發揮好世界窗口作用，向世界說好中國故事、說好香港故事。

最後，我祝願今天活動圓滿成功，在座各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

為改善路邊空氣質素及進一步保障巿民健康，環保署於二○二○年推出特惠資助計劃，以期在二○二七年年底前分階段淘汰約四萬輛歐盟四期柴油商業車輛（包括柴油貨車、非專利巴士和小型巴士）。合資格車主須在計劃推行期內，將其歐盟四期柴油商業車輛交由計劃下的登記拆車商拆毀，並於有關限期前到運輸署取消車輛登記，以及在取消車輛登記後三個月內申請特惠資助。

考慮到目前運輸業界在經營上正面對的挑戰和困難，部分於二○一○年及二
○一一年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛車主或未能於申領特惠資助的截止日期（即分別為二○二五年十二月三十一日及二○二六年十二月三十一日）前申請特惠資助，故環保署作出延長安排。

在延長安排下，於二○一○年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛，其申請資助的截止日期會延至二○二六年十二月三十一日；於二○一一年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛，其申請資助的截止日期則會延至二○二七年十二月三十一日。

環保署發言人提醒，二○一○年及二○一一年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛的車主仍須符合特惠資助計劃所訂定的其他申請資格及完成所有相關程序，並於其適用的新截止日期或之前提交特惠資助申請，方可獲批特惠資助。

此外，根據《空氣污染管制（空氣污染物排放）（受管制車輛）規例》（第311X章）（《規例》），政府將分別於二○二五年十二月三十一日及二○二六年十二月三十一日後停止為二○一○年及二○一一年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛發出／續發車輛牌照。在該日後需續領車輛牌照的相關車主，須按《規例》第6條向環保署申請豁免，以延後有關車輛的淘汰限期。

​行政長官在2025世界粵商大會致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-09-29 11:00,2025-09-29 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/29/P2025092900272.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（九月二十九日）在2025世界粵商大會的視像致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興通過視頻參與2025世界粵商大會。我首先熱烈恭賀本屆大會順利舉行！

今年是國家「十四五」規劃的收官之年，也是「十五五」規劃的謀篇布局之年。今年，習近平主席在民營企業座談會上發表重要講話，強調新時代、新征程民營經濟發展前景廣闊、大有可為，廣大民營企業和民營企業家大顯身手正當其時。

粵港澳大灣區建設是國家主席習近平親自謀劃、親自部署、親自推動的重大國家發展戰略，是引領國家高質量發展的重要引擎。大灣區人口超過8 700萬，去年經濟總量接近15萬億元人民幣。大灣區發展生機勃勃，機遇處處。

廣東是改革開放的排頭兵、先行地、實驗區，民營經濟和先進製造業發展蓬勃。粵商精神勇於創新，在海內外都建立了廣闊的商業網絡。廣東和香港山水相連、文化相通，大量港商在廣東經營企業。在推動國家發展的歷程中，在粵港商一直積極參與推動廣東的發展，拼搏向上，為廣東民營企業發展擔當重要角色，一同創造商業奇跡。

香港是廣東最大的外資來源地。去年，廣東省新設港資企業超過13000家，實際利用港商直接投資額，高達722億元人民幣，佔全省外商直接投資總額超過七成。港商投資的行業多元，已從製造業擴展到服務業。我鼓勵港商繼續把握好國家機遇，積極融入國家發展大局，深化國際交往，以香港所長，服務國家所需。

在中央的全力支持下，香港與各個大灣區城市優勢互補，共建一流灣區高質量發展。今年底由廣東、香港、澳門三地共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會），是大灣區標誌性的合作項目。本屆全運會和殘特奧會首次由粵港澳三地聯合承辦，體現粵港澳大灣區同心共進的凝聚力量，更彰顯國家對大灣區協同發展的堅定信心。

我在剛發表的第四份《施政報告》中，提出一系列深化改革的策略部署。其中，特區政府將制訂促進產業和投資的優惠政策包，吸引企業落戶香港。內地企業的戰略重心已轉向積極開拓新興市場，不再聚焦單一國家。政府會成立內地企業出海專班，主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台「出海」，為企業制訂多元方案。

香港將用好內聯外通的優勢，發揮好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色。我期待粵商、港商繼續變革求新、匯聚力量，在爭取更大發展空間的同時，積極貢獻大灣區的高質量發展。我們將與內地企業包括廣大粵商攜手共進，把海外資本「引進來」的同時，一同「走出去」開拓更多市場，對接環球買家，創造更廣大的商機。

最後，我祝願2025世界粵商大會圓滿成功，在座各位大展鴻圖。謝謝大家。"

EPD announces extension of application period for Ex-gratia Payment Scheme for Phasing Out Euro IV Diesel Commercial Vehicles,2025-09-29 11:00,2025-09-29 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/29/P2025092500496.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (September 29) announced a one-year extension to the application deadlines for the Ex-gratia Payment Scheme for Phasing Out Euro IV Diesel Commercial Vehicles for Euro IV diesel commercial vehicles first registered in 2010 and 2011.

  To improve roadside air quality and better safeguard public health, the EPD launched in 2020 an ex-gratia payment scheme to progressively phase out by the end of 2027 about 40 000 Euro IV diesel commercial vehicles (DCVs) including goods vehicles, non-franchised buses and light buses. Eligible vehicle owners should, during the implementation of the scheme, scrap their Euro IV DCVs through vehicle scrapping companies registered under the scheme. They should then go to the Transport Department to cancel the registration of their DCVs before the deadlines, and apply for the ex-gratia payment within three months after the cancellation of the vehicle's registration.

  Taking into account the challenges and difficulties the transportation industry is currently facing in its operations, some owners of Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2010 and 2011 might not be able to apply for the ex-gratia payment by the deadlines for application (i.e. December 31, 2025, and December 31, 2026, respectively), hence an extension arrangement has been made.

  Under the extension arrangement, the ex-gratia payment application deadline for Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2010 will be extended to December 31, 2026; and that for Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2011 to December 31, 2027.

  The EPD spokesman reminds the owners of Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2010 and 2011 that approval of the ex-gratia payment is still subject to the applicants meeting all other prevailing eligibility criteria and completing all necessary procedures under the ex-gratia payment scheme, and submitting the applications for the ex-gratia payment on or before the new deadlines that apply.

  Moreover, in accordance with the Air Pollution Control (Air Pollutant Emission)(Controlled Vehicles) Regulation (Cap. 311X), the Government will stop issuing/renewing vehicle licences to Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2010 and 2011 after December 31, 2025, and December 31, 2026, respectively. The vehicle owners concerned who need to apply for vehicle licence renewal after the deadlines shall apply to the EPD for exemption under Section 6 of the Regulation for extending the retirement deadlines.

  For details of the ex-gratia payment scheme and the above special arrangement, please refer to the EPD's website (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/air/prob_solutions/Phasing_out_euro_iv_comm_veh.html) or contact the EPD by calling 2651 1100 or by email to EU4dcv@epd.gov.hk."

A spokesman for the EDB said that it was envisaged that the MUSSS would benefit most Hong Kong students pursuing undergraduate studies on the Mainland with different financial needs.
  
Eligible students may apply for a means-tested subsidy (only for those students who have passed the means test) or a non-means-tested subsidy under the MUSSS. The subsidy under the MUSSS is granted on a yearly basis. The subsidised period covers the normal duration of the undergraduate programme pursued by the student concerned in the designated Mainland institution. Eligible applicants may only receive either a means-tested subsidy or a non-means-tested subsidy in the same academic year.
  
Details of the MUSSS are available on the EDB website (www.edb.gov.hk/musss). The EDB is expected to notify individual applicants of the application results in phases from the first quarter of 2026."

HKSARG strongly opposes US Department of State's 2025 Investment Climate Statements: Hong Kong,2025-09-28 22:18,2025-09-28 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800730.htm,"A spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government said today (September 28) that the United States (US) Department of State's 2025 Investment Climate Statements (the Report) contains various biased assertions regarding Hong Kong's business environment. In particular, the Report continues to maliciously smear and make unfounded and false accusations against the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO). For this, the HKSAR Government expresses strong discontent and firm opposition. The spokesman reiterated, ""The implementation of national security laws has restored a safe and stable environment in Hong Kong, not only safeguarding the rights and freedoms of the general public but also making Hong Kong a more attractive and secure destination for international capital and investment. Various data clearly demonstrate that Hong Kong's outstanding business environment remains highly appealing to enterprises and investors and capital from around the world. Our core advantages, along with the HKSAR Government's efforts in promoting economic and social development, are widely recognised by the international community. The biased and inaccurate claims made in the Report are groundless and pale in comparison to the facts.""

The spokesman continued, ""In fact, since the beginning of this year, the Hong Kong stock market has performed strongly, with the Hang Seng Index rising by around 30 per cent. Initial public offering fundraising has surged, placing Hong Kong first globally. Bank deposits have increased by around 8 per cent, reaching close to HK$19 trillion. The asset and wealth management industry saw assets under management grow by 13 per cent year-on-year to over HK$35 trillion in 2024. Hong Kong is on track to become the world's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre within the next few years. These figures demonstrate that international investors are casting their vote of confidence in Hong Kong with concrete actions.""

  ""Hong Kong continues to shine and rise in various international competitiveness rankings on economic freedom, finance, innovation and technology, education and talent. For instance, Hong Kong is recognised as the world's freest economy, one of the top three global financial centres, ranked third in global competitiveness, and, together with Shenzhen and Guangzhou, forms the world's leading innovation cluster.""

  ""According to the World Investment Report 2025 published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Hong Kong attracted US$126 billion in foreign direct investment in 2024, ranking third globally. As of last year, nearly 10 000 companies with overseas and Chinese Mainland parent companies had chosen Hong Kong as their base, marking a historic high. Among them, nearly 1 400 were from the US, registering a 9 per cent increase year-on-year. Since the end of 2022, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises has successfully brought in over 80 strategic enterprises to set up or expand their operations in Hong Kong, many of which are global leaders in cutting-edge technologies. In the first eight months of this year, Invest Hong Kong supported more than 440 enterprises in establishing or expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, representing a 14 per cent increase compared to the same period last year. Overseas and Chinese Mainland enterprises each accounted for about half of these projects. These all demonstrate that Hong Kong continues to be an ideal location for enterprises from around the world to set up and grow their businesses.""

The spokesman said, ""Under the 'one country, two systems' arrangement, the HKSAR continues to practise the common law and uphold the rule of law, and maintain a judiciary that exercises powers independently. Various surveys indicate that foreign businesses operating in Hong Kong generally express strong confidence in the city's rule of law. For example, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong's annual member survey published earlier this year showed that 83 per cent of US businesses based in Hong Kong were confident in Hong Kong's rule of law—an increase of 4 and 10 percentage points compared to 2024 and 2023, respectively. Meanwhile, 70 per cent of companies stated that their operations had not been negatively impacted by the national security laws. In fact, the legal provisions of the HKNSL and the SNSO, including their definitions, scope of application and target activities, are clearly defined. They also explicitly stipulate that property and investments within the HKSAR are protected by law. These laws in no way hinder the normal commercial activities or international exchanges of various organisations operating in Hong Kong. Judges, in handling all cases – including those involving national security – discharge their judicial duties independently and impartially, free from any interference. In the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index 2024, Hong Kong maintained a high overall ranking, ahead of the United States and certain countries that frequently make unfounded criticisms of Hong Kong's rule of law and human rights.""

The spokesman said, ""Amid the intensifying geopolitical tensions, and rising unilateralism and protectionism that disrupt the international trade system and global economic order, Hong Kong will, as always, continue to steadfastly uphold its status as a free port under the 'one country, two systems' principle. We will maintain free trade policies and a simple, low tax regime, while ensuring the free flow of capital, information, goods and talent – fully leveraging our role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder'. We will proactively integrate into the overall national development plan and align with national development strategies. In addition to consolidating our strengths in the traditional sectors, we are committed to nurturing emerging industries and expanding into new sectors. While deepening ties with established markets, we are also making great strides in enhancing our engagement with the Global South. We cordially invite enterprises and talent from around the world to invest, establish businesses, and develop their careers in the city, and to jointly seize the promising opportunities presented by Hong Kong's bright future."""
特區政府強烈反對美國國務院投資環境報告,2025-09-28 22:00,2025-09-28 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800731.htm,"特區政府發言人今日（九月二十八日）表示，美國國務院發表的《投資環境報告》（《報告》）中對香港營商環境多有偏頗的陳述，其中對《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》更是繼續惡意抹黑、作出無理失實的指控，特區政府對此表示強烈不滿和反對。發言人重申：「國安法律的實施，讓香港恢復安全穩定的環境，不僅保障了市民大眾的權利和自由，同時也讓香港成為更吸引國際資金和投資的安全港。種種數據顯示，香港卓越的營商環境對海內外企業和資金都極具吸引力，其核心優勢與特區政府推動經濟社會發展的努力，亦廣獲國際認同。《報告》中各種偏頗不實的說法，在事實面前顯得理虧無據、蒼白無力。」

「事實上，今年以來，港股表現暢旺，恆生指數上升了約30%、新股集資額大幅增長，位列全球第一；銀行存款上升約8%，接近19萬億港元。資產和財富管理業去年管理資產總值按年增長13%至超過35萬億港元，香港有望在數年內成為全球最大的跨境財富管理中心。這些數字都顯示國際投資者紛紛以實際行動對香港的營商環投下信心的一票。」

「在多項關於經濟自由度、金融、創科、教育、人才等的國際競爭力排名中，香港續創佳績、排名上升。香港是全球最自由的經濟體、世界三甲的金融中心、全球競爭力排名第三，也與深圳和廣州共同組成世界第一的創新集群。」

「根據聯合國貿易和發展會議發表的《2025年世界投資報告》，二○二四年，香港的外來直接投資流入金額高達1,260億美元，排名上升至全球第三位。截至去年，有近10 000家母公司在海外及中國內地的企業選擇香港作為基地，創歷史新高。其中，母公司在美國的公司近1 400家，同比上升9%。自二○二二年底至今，引進重點企業辦公室已吸引逾80間重點企業在香港落戶或拓展業務，其中不少是從事前沿科技的全球領軍企業。今年首八個月，投資推廣署共協助了超過440間企業在港開設或擴展業務，較去年同期增加14%，來自海外及中國內地的企業約各佔一半，證明香港繼續是海外及中國內地企業開設及擴展業務的理想地方。」

發言人指出：「在『一國兩制』下，香港特區繼續實行普通法、堅定維護法治，司法機構一直獨立行使審判權。根據各項調查，在港外商普遍對香港的法治抱有高度信心。例如，香港美國商會在今年初發表的年度會員調查顯示，有83%在港美企對香港法治有信心，比二○二四年及二○二三年分別增加4個及10個百分點；70%的企業指它們的運作沒有受到國安法律的影響。事實上，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的法律條文，包括定義、適用對象和範圍，均相當清晰，亦明確規定香港特區內的財產和投資受到法律保護，完全沒有窒礙各類組織在香港的正常商業行為和國際交流需要。法官在處理任何案件，包括涉及國家安全的案件時，均獨立公正地履行司法職務，不受任何干預。在「世界正義工程」去年公布的《2024年法治指數》，香港整體排名維持高位，繼續領先於美國和一些不時無理批評香港法治和人權狀況的國家。」

發言人指出：「當前地緣政治、單邊主義和保護主義加劇、衝擊國際貿易體系和全球經濟秩序，香港在『一國兩制』下，將一如既往堅定保持自由港的地位、實行自由貿易、簡單低稅制等政策，維持資金、資訊、貨物和人才自由流動，發揮『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的角色和功能。我們會積極融入國家發展大局、更主動對接國家發展戰略，既鞏固優勢產業，更培育新興產業和領域；在深化與傳統市場關係的同時，又努力拓展與全球南方市場的聯繫。我們歡迎海內外的企業和人才來港投資興業和發展事業，與我們共享未來亮麗的發展機遇。」"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-28 17:30,2025-09-28 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800536.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 28), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 23 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

 
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
"Emergency repair works for pressurised sewage rising main at Mills and Chung Path, Southern District, Hong Kong Island completed by DSD",2025-09-28 16:04,2025-09-28 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800485.htm,"âThe Drainage Services Department (DSD) completed the emergency repair works for a pressurised sewage main at Mills and Chung Path, Southern District, Hong Kong Island this morning (September 28). The repaired sewage main has resumed service.

During a routine inspection on September 25, the DSD found that there were multiple damage along a section of pressurized sewage main, about 60 metres long and 450 millimetres in diameter at Mills and Chung Path, Southern District, Hong Kong Island, which was caused by the passage of Super Typhoon Ragasa. The DSD immediately suspended the use of the damaged sewage main and diverted sewage to the emergency sewage treatment facilities at the Repulse Bay Main Sewage Pumping Station. The sewage underwent chemically enhanced settlement and disinfection before being discharged into the sea, while emergency repair works on the affected sewage main were carried out.

As the concerned sewage pipe is located on a natural rocky shore under Mills and Chung Path with no direct vehicular or pedestrian access, the DSD's engineering team had to build a temporary work passage and platform for carrying out emergency repair works round-the-clock. During execution of the repair works, temporary traffic arrangements were implemented on Island Road to transport construction equipment and materials.

The DSD has immediately notified the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) upon completion of the repair works today. The EPD has arranged to collect seawater samples from Deep Water Bay Beach and Repulse Bay Beach for water quality testing. The test results are expected to be available tomorrow. If the results are satisfactory, the EPD will notify the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to reopen the beaches."

署方於九月二十五日恆常巡查期間，發現一條位於香港島南區苗鍾徑下方一段直徑450毫米，長約60米的加壓污水管，因超強颱風「樺加沙」吹襲造成多處受損。署方已即時停用涉事污水管，並將污水引流至淺水灣總污水泵房旁的現有緊急應變污水處理設施，經過化學強化沉澱及消毒處理程序後，才排放出大海，並為涉事污水管進行緊急修復工程。

由於涉事污水管位於苗鐘徑下方的天然石灘，沒有行車或行人通道直達，渠務署工程團隊須搭建臨時工作通道及平台，以便24小時進行緊急修復工程。工程期間，香島道曾實施臨時交通措施，以運送建築器材和物料。

Remarks by S for Health at media session on cancer screening programmes (English only),2025-09-28 14:18,2025-09-28 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800418.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, at a media session after attending a radio programme this morning (September 28):

Reporter: As the Government is rolling out new cancer screening programmes, including hepatitis B, how many people are expected to benefit from the schemes? Is there a timetable for that? Also, as the scheme has a co-payment platform, how many per cent would be paid by the people themselves? Can you elaborate more on how AI can be utilised in this cancer screening programme?

Secretary for Health: In the Policy Address this year, the Chief Executive has announced that we will initiate some other cancer screening programmes, including using the study of artificial intelligence for the screening of lung cancer, which is in fact the number one cancer in Hong Kong. And also hepatitis B, which is the most common cause for liver cancer in Hong Kong - accounting for over 80 per cent of the cases, will also be included in the programme. The other thing is about the HPV virus - the human papillomavirus - screening for cervical cancer. These are the three programmes we will be rolling out in addition to the existing ones for collateral cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer screenings.

  Regarding the platform we will be using, for hepatitis B, for example, we will be incorporating it into our existing Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme, which is at present targeting at patients with high blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol level. We will be using the same platform and the same kind of model for co-care, and following the same situation. The percentage of subsidy of co-care will be roughly in ""half-half"", that is the concept we are going forward.

  For individual cancer screening progamme, this is a study which will be commissioned with a university. As we figure out that for cancer screening, it requires radiology most of the time. Low dose CT scan is the existing screening modality. We will be targeting at certain high-risk groups, for example, those with family history of lung cancer. These are not the smoking-related squamous cell carcinoma. We are targeting at the more recent rising incidence of adenocarcinoma of lung. We will identify high-risk groups for screening, and it will be a commissioned project, which we will start likely at the beginning of 2026.

For hepatitis B screening, we will be targeting at the high-risk population as well. These are the family members of known chronic hepatitis B carriers. As you may know, we have already initiated the universal hepatitis B vaccination for all newborns since 1988, so people who are born after 1988 would have received vaccinations. The chronic carrier rate is very low, under one per cent. On the other hand, for those born before 1988, they may not have received vaccination. In fact, the chronic carrier rate is still at the region of about 7.8 per cent. We estimate there will still be roughly over 400 000 chronic hepatitis B carriers, and 40 per cent of them are yet known - they don't know that they are carriers themselves. The most common population among those are the family members, so these are the targets that we are looking at, and that will be the programme we will be rolling out.

Reporter: Do you have an estimation like how many people are targeted for the hepatitis B screening?

Secretary for Health: For hepatitis B carriers, among the chronic carriers, we have roughly estimated that there are about 700 000 family members, and roughly about 40 per cent are eligible for screening, so we will be looking at the region of about 300 000 people. We will go by phases, and initially will be targeting at this high-risk population.

Reporter: Is there a target time for that?

Secretary for Health: We will be announcing the programme within this year, and we will be definitely incorporating it into our Chronic Disease Co-Care Platform, in which existing ones are screenings for hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. We will be mobilising our District Health Centres, all general medical practitioners and family doctors in the community, and that will help us build up a platform incorporating these parties, building up a concept of ""Family Doctor for all"". Thank you."

The officer immediately called for reinforcement to provide first-aid treatment to her. The person in custody was found unconscious at the time and was subsequently sent to a public hospital for further treatment.

A clinical psychologist of the Department will follow up on the case.

A spokesman for the Correctional Services Department said, ""The department uses all possible measures to prevent persons in custody from attempting suicide or self-harm. These measures include administrative arrangements, improvements of institution facilities, staff training and first-aid services.""

The person in custody was sentenced to imprisonment for the offence of possession of forged identity cards in April 2025."
