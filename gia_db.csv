立法會十六題：打擊販賣偽造香港證明文件,2025-09-25 12:33,2025-09-25 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500560.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據報有商戶透過內地電商平台，兜售五花八門偽造的香港通用證件，當中包括大專院校學生證、畢業證書、香港身份證、紀律部隊委任證、不同俱樂部泊車貼，甚至仿製封閉道路通行許可證（禁區紙）也可供選購。此外，有傳媒發現內地網購平台有大量商戶，售賣香港水、電、煤氣帳單、供客戶用作地址證明的造假糧單及租約，有賣家甚至在假帳單上使用真實存在的香港地址資料，更指住戶不知地址已被盜用。有意見認為，上述林林總總、難辨真偽虛假香港證明、帳單文件的販賣活動已達嚴重泛濫程度；同時，現任中國人民政治協商會議全國委員會（全國政協）副主席暨前行政長官亦在其個人社交媒體撰文指「誠信、商譽、守法意識是香港賴以為生優勢，任何假冒和香港相關東西都應下架」，並呼籲涉事內地電商平台「發財立品，不能損害全體中國商人聲譽」。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）就內地商戶違法販賣本港假證和假帳單情況，除上述全國政協副主席暨前特首親自督促外，政府有何應對政策；

（二）有否調查上述販賣假證和假帳單情況是否已導致大量不法分子在港行騙、入學、就業、開設銀行或金融帳戶或騙取社會服務及福利情況；如有，詳情為何，以及有否成功起訴個案；

（三）據報今年上半年累計近千名專上學生被騙逾一億元，港漂學生佔半數，當局有否調查或評估，眾多涉及內地來港人士被騙巨額款項案件，與在港使用假證或假帳單的關連性，例如是否有人曾在港使用偽造執法人員證件行騙，甚或有受害人以虛假證明入職公司或入讀院校後，非法轉移內地資金來港，因懼怕內地執法機關查究而墮入騙局；如有，當局曾偵破多少宗同類案件；

（四）有何措施或政策，以捍衞上述「香港賴以為生優勢」及保護本港誠信、商譽和守法意識，並設法令內地電商平台「發財立品」，杜絕所有涉及假冒本港證明文件的商品；及

（五）有否研究或評估，上述販賣假證、假文件行為猖獗，連同假冬蟲夏草種子、冒牌飲用水及冒牌牆磚等數之不盡售港的假貨品，以及眾多被揭發使用偽造學歷文件的學生和專才，對本港多年來一直奉行的「誠信制度」（honour system）帶來何等衝擊；當局日後制訂政策時，會否一改以往以信任為本的觀念，以加強防範有關不法行為？

答覆：

主席：

詐騙乃嚴重罪行。任何人干犯《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）第16A條「欺詐罪」，最高可判處監禁14年；若被控同一條例第17條「以欺騙手段取得財產」，最高可判處監禁10年。《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）第71至75條訂明製造、使用或管有虛假文書最高可判監禁14年。另外，任何人因詐騙得益而被控《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章） 第25條「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」，最高可判處監禁14年及罰款500萬元。

無論騙案發生於線上或線下、透過任何方式進行，只要涉及違法行為，政府都會嚴正執法，絕不姑息。

就議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）政府留意到近日有商戶經網上平台售賣偽造證件等疑似虛假文書。我們高度關注此等懷疑違法行為。

首先，利用虛假文書行騙或干犯上述的《盜竊罪條例》（第210章），最高可判處監禁14年。另外，根據《刑事罪行條例》（第200章），製造、出售或使用虛假文書（包括題述的偽造證件、證書、帳單、租約等）均屬嚴重罪行。任何人製造虛假文書，或在知道或相信某虛假文書屬虛假的情況下使用或管有該文書或其副本，並意圖誘使另一人接受該文書為真文書，並因而作出或不作某些作為，以致對該另一人或其他人不利，一經定罪，最高可處監禁14年。

事實上，香港警務處一直就偽造文件相關罪案嚴厲執法。二○二五年一至七月，警方共接獲546宗涉及偽造文件的案件，共拘捕337人。在二○二五年第一季，共有46宗就相關罪行提出的案件完成審訊，定罪率約為85%。

針對製造及行使虛假香港身份證的跨境罪行，警方於八月聯同香港入境事務處（入境處）及內地相關執法部門採取聯合行動，在兩地共拘捕42人，並在深圳搗破一個偽造香港身份證製造場所，搜獲60多張偽造證件製成品、製造偽證原材料及工具。

過去警方一直與內地公安機關緊密合作，並已建立情報互換機制，以打擊相關的跨境罪行。警方早前注意到懷疑有不法商人在內地網上平台出售涉及香港的偽造證件、帳單等，已即時將相關資料通報內地公安機關要求涉事平台迅速行動，移除相關帖文並作進一步跟進。警方雖暫時未觀察到這類犯案手法有明顯增長的趨勢，但我們絕不會掉以輕心。警方會持續留意這類犯案手法，並繼續與內地相關部門保持緊密合作，打擊相關罪行。

（三）新來港人士因為不熟悉本港的制度、騙案情況、求助方法等，較容易受騙，尤其是當中的內地來港就讀的學生。假冒政府人員是其中一個針對此類群組常見的詐騙技倆。就此類詐騙行為（不論是否涉及偽造政府人員工作證），警方一直嚴厲執法。警方於二○二五年一至八月接獲584宗涉及假冒政府人員的騙案，較去年同期減少10.2%，損失金額更大幅下跌64.7%，反映警方的各類防騙工作奏效。

除了執法行動外，提高市民防騙意識亦至關重要。在宣傳教育方面，警方針對不同群組制訂不同具針對性的防騙策略。警方早前與國家移民管理局、公安部刑偵局及香港入境處共同製作防騙視頻，展示騙徒假冒政府人員的犯案手法，提高新來港人士的警惕，並自二○二五年六月起在各口岸、內地出入境辦證大廳，以及小紅書、抖音等社交媒體播放。

為特別加強保護新來港學生，警方與國家反詐中心安排線上線下學生及家長分享會，並向家長派發防騙須知信息。為繼續加強他們抵港後的宣傳教育，警方早前與香港理工大學合作進行有關大學生詐騙認知的調查，收集逾3 000份回覆，發現近85%受訪者曾參與網上防騙教育套件，當中內地生參與率超過90%，而曾完成學習套件的學生遭遇詐騙而有金錢損失的比率比未曾參與者低58%。警方會繼續協調各院校安排新生參與。

自今年新學年開始，警方已走訪各大學進行反詐宣傳。警務處處長早前亦透過全港大專院校去信新來港學生及他們的家長，呼籲他們要特別留意幾類常見行騙手法，以及防範的方法，並鼓勵他們善用警方的「防騙易熱線」及「防騙視伏App」。

（四）及（五）政府致力鞏固香港購物天堂的地位。為保持消費者在香港購物的信心，香港有不同的法例保障消費者權益。香港海關（海關）是《商品說明條例》的主要執法機關，除了一直透過執法行動打擊不良營商手法，亦積極推行合規推廣及宣傳教育。就打擊網上侵權罪行，海關設有反互聯網盜版隊專責進行網絡調查，並以自動網上監察系統24小時進行網上巡邏及偵測網上的侵權活動，另外如證實有人於網上交易平台出售侵權物品，海關會要求該平台移除涉及侵權活動的帖文。

就涉及虛假陳述及欺詐行為，包括上文已詳述的涉及製造、使用或管有虛假文書的違法行為，各相關執法部門必定嚴肅跟進，將不法之徒繩之於法。

反詐工作有賴全社會（包括政府、機構及個人層面）齊心協力，共同築起反詐防線，時刻提高警覺，並採取一切可行的措施，不讓騙徒有機可乘。市民如發現有任何可疑情況，應即時向警方作出舉報，警方必定嚴肅跟進。政府亦呼籲任何人切勿因一時貪念以身試法。"
LCQ16: Combating sales of forged Hong Kong certification documents,2025-09-25 12:33,2025-09-25 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500566.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 It has been reported that some merchants offer for sale a wide variety of forged Hong Kong general certification documents, including tertiary institution student cards, graduation certificates, Hong Kong identity cards, warrant cards of disciplined services, parking permit stickers of various clubs and even counterfeit Closed Road Permits ( Closed Area Permit) on Mainland e-commerce platforms. In addition, some media have uncovered that there are numerous merchants on Mainland e-commerce platforms offering false Hong Kong utility bills for water, electricity and gas, along with fabricated pay slips and tenancies for use as proof of address. Some sellers even use genuine Hong Kong address information on such false bills. It is also pointed out that residents are unaware that their addresses have been stolen. There are views that the sale of such diverse, hard-to-verify false Hong Kong certification documents and bills has become seriously prevalent. At the same time, on his personal social media, the current Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and former Chief Executive of Hong Kong wrote that ""integrity, business reputation and law-abiding awareness are the advantages upon which Hong Kong relies for its survival. Any counterfeit Hong Kong-related items should be removed from shelves."" He also called on the involved Mainland e-commerce platforms to ""make money with integrity and not to damage the reputation of all Chinese merchants."" In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) regarding Mainland merchants' illegal sale of false Hong Kong certification documents and bills, apart from the aforesaid urge made personally by the Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC and former Chief Executive, of the Government's policies to address the issue;

(2) whether any investigation has been conducted into whether the aforesaid sale of false certification documents and bills has led to a large number of lawbreakers committing fraud, enrolling in schools, engaging in employment, opening bank or financial accounts, or obtaining social services and benefits in Hong Kong; if investigation has been conducted, of the details, and whether any successful prosecutions have been made;

(3) as it has been reported that nearly a thousand post-secondary students were defrauded of over $100 million in the first half of this year, with ""Hong Kong drifter"" students making up half of the victims, whether the authorities have investigated or assessed the connection between numerous cases involving people coming to Hong Kong from the Mainland being defrauded of substantial amounts of money and the use of false certification documents or bills, such as whether anyone used forged law enforcement credentials to commit fraud in Hong Kong, or whether any victims, after gaining employment or admission to institutions using false certification documents, illegally transferred Mainland funds to Hong Kong, thus falling into scams out of fear of investigations by Mainland law enforcement agencies; if the authorities have, of the number of similar cases detected;

(4) of the measures or policies in place to safeguard the aforesaid ""advantages upon which Hong Kong relies for its survival"" and protect Hong Kong's integrity, business reputation and law-abiding awareness, and to ensure that Mainland e-commerce platforms will ""make money with integrity"" and eliminate all goods involving false Hong Kong certification documents; and

(5) whether any research or assessment has been conducted on how the aforesaid rampant sale of false certificates and documents and countless counterfeit goods sold in Hong Kong such as false Cordyceps seeds, counterfeit drinking water and counterfeit wall tiles, as well as many students and professionals found to have used forged academic documents, have impacted the ""honour system"" upheld by Hong Kong for years; whether the authorities will change from the previous trust-based philosophy when formulating policies in the future, so as to strengthen safeguards against such illegal activities?

Reply:

President,

 Deception is a serious crime. Any person who commits the offence of ""fraud"" under section 16A of the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) is liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years, while any person charged with ""obtaining property by deception"" under section 17 of the same Ordinance is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years. Sections 71 to 75 of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) provide that the maximum penalty for making, using or possessing a false instrument is imprisonment for 14 years. In addition, any person charged with ""dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" under section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) for proceeds of deception is liable to maximum penalties of 14 years' imprisonment and a fine of $5 million.

 Regardless of whether deception takes place online or offline and the tactics used, the Government will take stern enforcement actions and there will be no tolerance as long as there are illegal activities involved.

 The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) The Government has noticed that some merchants have been selling forged certification documents and other suspected false instruments via online platforms recently. We express great concern over such suspected illegal activities.

 Firstly, using a false instrument to deceive or committing the aforesaid offences under the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. In addition, under the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200), making, selling or using a false instrument (including forged certification documents, certificates, bills and tenancies as mentioned in the question) is a serious crime. A person who makes a false instrument, or uses or possesses an instrument (or a copy of it) which is and which he knows or believes to be false, with the intention to induce somebody to accept it as genuine and, as a result, to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person's prejudice, is liable on conviction to imprisonment for up to 14 years.

 As a matter of fact, the Hong Kong Police Force has been taking stringent enforcement actions against crimes relating to forgery of documents. From January to July 2025, the Police received a total of 546 cases involving forgery of documents and arrested 337 persons. In the first quarter of 2025, trials for 46 cases initiated in respect of relevant crimes were concluded. The conviction rate was about 85 per cent.

 Targeting cross-border crimes involving the making and using of false Hong Kong identity cards (HKICs), the Police conducted an operation in collaboration with the Hong Kong Immigration Department (ImmD) and relevant law enforcement agencies of the Mainland in August, arresting a total of 42 persons in the Mainland and Hong Kong. A production base of forged HKICs was smashed in Shenzhen, where some 60 finished items of forged certification documents, as well as raw materials and tools for producing forged documents, were seized.

 The Police have all long maintained close co-operation with Mainland public security authorities and established an intelligence exchange mechanism to combat relevant cross-border crimes. The Police recently noticed and suspected that some unscrupulous merchants were selling forged certification documents and bills of Hong Kong on Mainland online platforms. Mainland public security authorities were immediately notified of such, and the platforms concerned were requested to act promptly to remove the relevant posts and take further follow up actions. While the Police have not observed a significant upward trend in this modus operandi at this stage, we will not let our guard down. The Police will continue to pay attention to such modus operandi and maintain close co-operation with relevant Mainland authorities to combat these crimes.

(3) New arrivals to Hong Kong, in particular Mainland students coming to Hong Kong for studies, are more prone to becoming victims of fraud because they are unfamiliar with Hong Kong's systems, fraud situation and ways of seeking help. Impersonating government officials is one of the common tactics employed to defraud this group. To tackle such fraudulent activities (whether forged identification cards of government officials are involved or not), the Police have been taking stringent enforcement actions. From January to August 2025, the Police received 584 fraud cases involving impersonation of government officials, which represents a decrease of 10.2 per cent from the same period last year. The monetary loss incurred has significantly dropped by 64.7 per cent, showing the effectiveness of the Police's fraud prevention efforts on all fronts.

 Besides law enforcement, raising public awareness is also of vital importance. On publicity and education, the Police have devised targeted anti-fraud strategies for various groups. In collaboration with the National Immigration Administration, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and the ImmD, the Police have produced anti-fraud video clips showing the modus operandi of fraudsters impersonating government officials, with a view to heightening the alertness of the new arrivals. Starting from June 2025, the videos are broadcast across boundary control points, exit-entry service halls in the Mainland as well as social media platforms including Xiaohongshu and Douyin.

 To provide strengthened protection particularly for students who newly arrive in Hong Kong, the Police and the National Anti-Fraud Center have jointly organised both online and offline sharing sessions for the students and their parents. Informative materials on fraud prevention have also been distributed to parents. To continue to step up publicity and education for them after their arrival, the Police have collaborated with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to conduct a survey on the awareness of fraud among university students earlier. Of the over 3 000 replies collected, it was found that nearly 85 per cent of the respondents have enrolled in the anti-scam online learning package, with the participation rate of Mainland students exceeding 90 per cent. For students who had completed the learning package, the number who fell prey to fraud and suffered monetary loss were 58 per cent lower than those who had never enrolled in the learning package. The Police will continue to co-ordinate with institutions and arrange for new students' enrolment in the learning package.

 Since the beginning of this new school year, the Police have visited various universities to carry out anti-fraud publicity campaigns. Earlier on, the Commissioner of Police has also sent a letter to the newly arrived students and their parents through all tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, urging them to pay particular attention to several common fraud tactics and advising them of ways to guard against such fraud. They are also encouraged to make good use of the Police's Anti Scam Helpline and ""Scameter+"".

(4) and (5) The Government is committed to consolidating Hong Kong's status as a shopping paradise. To maintain consumers' confidence in shopping in Hong Kong, there are various laws in Hong Kong to protect consumers' rights and interests. The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), being the principal enforcement agency of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, carries out compliance promotion as well as publicity and education in addition to enforcement actions, with a view to combating unfair trade practices. To combat online infringement crimes, the C&ED has an Anti-Internet Piracy Team in place specifically responsible for conducting online investigations. It also operates automated online monitoring systems to conduct 24-hour online patrols and detect online infringing activities. When the sale of infringing items on online trading platforms is confirmed, the C&ED will request the removal of posts involving infringing activities from the platforms.

 As regards the acts of false statement and fraud, including illegal activities involving the making, using or possessing of a false instrument as elaborated above, relevant law enforcement agencies will follow up on every case stringently to bring the criminals to justice.

 The fight against fraud counts on the concerted efforts of the entire society (on the levels of the Government, organisations and individuals) to build an anti-fraud barrier, stay vigilant at all times and take every practicable measure to leave no chance for the fraudsters. When suspicious circumstances are identified, the public should immediately report to the Police, which will take follow-up actions seriously. The Government also reminds all members of the public not to commit any offence out of momentary greed."
立法會十七題：鄉郊及偏遠景點的食肆,2025-09-25 12:30,2025-09-25 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500484.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上葉劉淑儀議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

註：獲批的申請未必是於同年遞交。

（三）在二○二二年至二○二五年八月三十一日期間，食環署共接獲四宗來自離島、北區、西貢、沙田和元朗的鄉郊景點，以及南區偏遠景點的食物業牌照申請。一宗位於沙頭角的普通食肆牌照申請已經獲批；一宗位於長沙的普通食肆牌照申請因申請人一直未有按相關部門要求清拆違規構築物，因而被視作撤消；另有兩宗位於石澳的小食食肆牌照申請仍在處理中。

（四）政府致力改善偏遠鄉郊地區的交通及通訊網絡配套。現時，不少遠離市中心的郊遊景點，已有發展成熟的公共交通服務和道路網絡連接。運輸署一直密切留意各地區的交通需求，並協調服務營辦商為不少遠離市區的郊遊景點提供公共交通服務，例如往返西貢水域附近島嶼的街渡渡輪服務，方便市民和旅客前往這些景點。至於其他較偏遠的鄉郊地方，運輸署會考慮道路網絡和實際環境和情況，盡力安排適切的公共交通服務，接載訪客前往景點的附近位置。此外，在印洲塘一帶，為改善當地鄉郊熱門景點的暢達性，在政府與當地社區共同協調下，已經在過去兩年逐步提升由沙頭角及大水坑往來荔枝窩、吉澳及鴨洲等的渡輪服務；鄉郊保育辦公室亦正研究如何改善前往谷埔的方法，期望能為村民、遊客以至當地的食肆經營者帶來裨益。

在通訊網絡方面，通訊事務管理局辦公室已於二○二五年七月推出「擴展5G網絡至鄉郊及偏遠地區資助計劃」，資助流動網絡營辦商於全港不同鄉郊地區設置約50個無線電基站。政府亦會繼續推展「擴展光纖網絡至偏遠地區鄉村資助計劃」，新建的光纖網絡將於二○二六年內完成拓展至新界及離島地區共235條鄉村，加強鄉郊地區的網絡覆蓋。

（五）為促進生態旅遊、利便訪客和協助活化荒僻村落，政府成立了跨部門的「鄉郊地區賓館及食物業牌照工作小組」，為現時位於新界偏遠鄉郊、沒有車路連接的鄉郊村落，因應偏遠鄉郊地區的獨特性，制訂一系列涵蓋城市規劃、土地、消防安全、樓宇安全及衞生等方面的牌照申請優化措施，並促成在谷埔及西貢鹽田梓的個案成功取得食物業牌照。

「工作小組」現正梳理相關便利措施的細節和執行步驟，並會將其匯編成一套《申請指引》，預計二○二五年第四季公開發布。政府會持續檢視鄉郊地區食物業牌照申領過程的優化空間，為鄉郊地區締造更友善的營商環境，支持鄉郊保育和活化的工作。"
LCQ17: Restaurants at rural and remote attractions,2025-09-25 12:30,2025-09-25 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500509.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Mrs Regina Ip and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that tourism experiences at quite a number of rural and remote tourist attractions are impacted by a lack of nearby restaurants for visitors to dine in. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the numbers of existing licensed restaurants at rural attractions in Outlying Islands, North District, Sai Kung, Sha Tin and Yuen Long, as well as at remote attractions in Southern District, together with a breakdown by licence type; if it has not kept such figures, of the reasons for that;

(2) of the respective numbers of applications received and approved by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) over the past three years for various types of restaurant licences concerning the attractions in the districts mentioned in (1);

(3) of the respective numbers of applications received, approved and rejected by the FEHD over the past three years for various types of restaurant licences concerning Shek O, Sha Tau Kok, Cheung Sha, Pui O and Pak Nai, and the reasons for application rejection;

(4) whether the Government has currently formulated measures to attract tourists to visit restaurants at rural and remote attractions, such as expediting improvements to transport and communication network facilities in those areas; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) given that the Government proposed in the 2020 Policy Address that the Countryside Conservation Office work with relevant bureaux/departments to jointly develop a set of licensing requirements and procedural guidelines designed especially for guesthouses and catering business in countryside areas, making reference to the special nature and restrictions of rural settings, of the current work progress and the expected time for introducing such requirements and guidelines?

Note: The applications approved might not be received in the same year.

(3) Between 2022 and August 31, 2025, the FEHD received four restaurant licence applications at rural tourist spots in Islands, North District, Sai Kung, Sha Tin, Yuen Long, and remote locations in Southern District. An application for a restaurant licence in Sha Tau Kok has been approved; another one in Cheung Sha was considered withdrawn due to failure of the applicant to remove unauthorised structures as required by relevant departments; and two snack shop licence applications in Shek O are still being processed.

(4) The Government attaches importance to enhancing transportation and telecommunication network in remote countryside area. At present, many hiking spots located away from the city centre are connected by well-developed public transport services and road network. The Transport Department (TD) has been closely monitoring the transport needs across various districts and coordinating with service providers to arrange public transport services for numerous hiking attractions located away from the city centre, for example, kaito ferry services to and from islands near the Sai Kung waters, to facilitate access by the public and visitors to these attractions. Regarding other more remote countryside area, the TD will consider the road network and actual situation and conditions to arrange public transport services as appropriate to transport visitors to locations near these attractions. Furthermore, in Yan Chau Tong areas, to improve accessibility to popular rural attractions, ferry services running from Sha Tau Kok and Tai Shui Hang to Lai Chi Wo, Kat O and Ap Chau, etc., have been enhanced gradually in the past two years through coordination between the Government and the local communities. The Countryside Conservation Office is also reviewing means to improve accessibility to Kuk Po. These initiatives seek to benefit villagers, tourists and local food business operators.

  On telecommunications networks, the Office of the Communications Authority launched the Subsidy Scheme to Extend 5G Coverage in Rural and Remote Areas in July 2025 to subsidise mobile network operators to establish around 50 radio base stations in various rural area across Hong Kong. In addition, the Government will continue to implement the Subsidy Scheme to Extend Fibre-based Networks to Villages in Remote Areas. The new fibre-based networks are expected to be extended to a total of 235 villages in the New Territories and outlying islands by 2026, further strengthening network coverage in rural area.

(5) To promote eco-tourism, facilitate visitors and help revitalise desolate villages, the Government set up the inter-departmental Task Force on Guesthouse and Food Business Licences in Countryside Areas and formulated a series of streamlined measures to facilitate licence applications for the countryside villages in the New Territories that have no vehicular access taking into account the uniqueness of remote countryside.These streamlined measures cover various aspects, including town planning, land, fire safety, building safety and sanitary requirements, and have facilitated the successful grant of food business licences to the operators in Kuk Po and Yim Tin Tsai, Sai Kung.

  The Task Force is sorting out the details and implementation procedures of the streamlined measures and compiling a set of Guide to Application with its official release scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025. The Government will continue to review opportunities for further enhancement of the licence application process for food business in countryside area, with a view to creating a more business-friendly environment there and promoting countryside conservation and revitalisation."
​立法會九題：便利旅行團的交通措施,2025-09-25 12:28,2025-09-25 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500542.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上姚柏良議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

關於便利旅行團的交通措施，政府可否告知本會：

（一） 鑑於有旅遊業界人士反映，香園圍口岸經常出現擠塞，影響旅客體驗，政府有否研究於今年國慶節假期前，在該口岸實施短期的交通紓緩措施，例如容許接載出境旅行團的旅遊巴士可在出境樓層落客，以避免地面公共交通交匯處出現人潮和車輛擠塞的情況；

（二） 鑑於有旅遊業界人士認為，目前大部分旅行團選擇過境的香園圍口岸的日均出入境人次已達其設計容量三倍，加快沙頭角口岸重建以便利旅行團出入境及交通往來迫在眉睫，而據悉重建後的沙頭角口岸將定位為純旅檢口岸，有關工程的具體時間表為何；

（三）鑑於今年是抗戰勝利80周年，有不少旅遊業界人士反映，沙頭角周邊的鹿頸路限制旅遊巴士駛入，阻礙旅行團參觀抗戰遺蹟，當局會否加快改善該道路的基建設施；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（四） 鑑於業界人士指出，西貢萬宜水庫東壩深受旅客歡迎，但由於該處實施交通管制，每天可簽發的29座以下旅遊巴士服務許可證配額僅限三張，而且申請手續繁複，在人流較多的周末和公眾假期批出許可證的機會極低，以致業界難以打造旅遊產品，當局會否進一步增加旅遊巴士進入東壩的配額，以便利業界規劃旅行團路線，提升生態遊旅客的體驗；及

（五）鑑於啟德體育園在大型盛事期間實施限制，持出租汽車許可證車輛及旅遊巴士（即屬遊覽服務（A01）牌照的非專營巴士）未能進入主場館範圍，不利於業界打造「盛事+旅遊」產品，政府會否放寬有關交通管制，並設立預約機制，讓該兩類牌照車輛可停靠在主場館下的旅遊巴士泊車位或園區其他合適位置，從而提升旅客體驗？

答覆：

主席：

隨着旅客來往內地與香港愈趨頻繁，政府持續密切監察各陸路邊境管制站和各區包括旅遊熱點的人流及車流情況，協調相關部門和營辦商做好人流疏導和交通管理安排。

就姚議員提問的各部分，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局、環境及生態局、保安局和運輸署後，現回覆如下：

（一）香園圍管制站（下稱「管制站」）是一個採用「人車直達」設計的通關口岸，自二○二三年二月旅檢服務啟用以來，一直深受跨境旅客歡迎，人流持續上升。管制站設有公共運輸交匯處、旅遊巴士上落客區（下稱「上落客區」）、跨境巴士上落客區、私家車上落客區及公眾停車場等配套設施，以配合跨境旅客不同的出行模式及乘車需要。其中，上落客區包括九個停車灣位，供本地非專營巴士（包括旅遊巴士）專用。

運輸署一直留意旅遊巴士在管制站使用上落客區的情況，並不時進行實地調查。該上落客區位於管制站地面樓層，根據運輸署觀察所得，現時旅遊巴士使用上落客區的安排可滿足相關旅客的需求，我們留意到載送內地旅行團前往管制站過關離港的旅遊巴士，主要集中在下午及晚上時段使用上落客區。上落客區停車位在這些時段的人潮和車流大致暢順，沒有造成擠塞的情況，而且上落客區有足夠的剩餘停車灣位供旅遊巴士使用，於今年農曆新年和五一黃金周亦足以滿足需求。就有關提問中建議進一步考慮容許本地旅遊巴士使用跨境巴士上落客區（設於管制站一樓樓層出境部分），由於該處的道路設計只能讓跨境巴士在落客後直接駛至車輛檢查亭辦理離境手續，並未設置車輛掉頭設施，故此未必適合供旅遊巴士使用。

一如既往，運輸署會與口岸部門在國慶節假期期間密切留意管制站的整體交通車流，以及旅遊巴士上落客區的運作情況，並會在有需要時加強人流管理措施和彈性處理旅遊巴士上落客安排，以確保整體運作暢順。

（二）為了提升通關效率及推動沙頭角一帶的發展，特區政府和深圳市政府於二○二四年達成共識，以「跨河建」的安排重建沙頭角口岸，即雙方同步建設橫跨沙頭角河的旅檢大樓，以河中心為界緊鄰布置各自的旅檢查驗通道。重建後的沙頭角口岸將成為純旅檢口岸，取消貨檢功能以配合落實跨境貨運「東進東出、西進西出」的布局，即跨境貨車須改用東部蓮塘／香園圍口岸和西部深圳灣口岸，其他陸路口岸則主力處理客運。重建後的沙頭角口岸並會實施「合作查驗、一次放行」的通關模式，進一步提升旅客過關體驗及效率。

香港特別行政區（特區）政府聘請的顧問公司正為沙頭角口岸重建項目進行工程可行性研究，有關研究預計於二○二五年內完成。研究範圍包括重建沙頭角口岸所涉及的土地範圍、道路及基礎設施、交通影響評估、環境和文物保育等事項。

我們了解深圳方正同步積極籌備沙頭角口岸重建項目的設計招標及相關可行性研究工作。特區政府會繼續與深圳市政府緊密合作，積極推進重建項目。

（三）鹿頸路彎多、路面狹窄，基於現場環境所限及交通安全的考慮，鹿頸路現時全日禁止重量超過5.5公噸的車輛、巴士、旅遊巴士及公共小型巴士（專線小巴例外）駛入。儘管如此，考慮到區內旅遊發展等出行需要，運輸署會因應交通情況發出禁區許可證，容許29座或以下的旅遊巴於非繁忙時段使用鹿頸路，以照顧一般旅客和旅行團的需求。為方便旅遊業界了解鹿頸路的交通安排，運輸署已透過香港旅遊業議會的網頁向業界發放申請禁區許可證手續等相關資訊。

按運輸署的評估，目前鹿頸路的容量足夠應付整體交通需求，包括申請禁區許可證的車輛需求，運輸署將繼續密切留意附近一帶的交通並作妥善安排。

（四）往萬宜水庫東壩的西貢萬宜路屬一條水務署的「維修用途通道」，主要供水務署和漁農自然護理署（漁護署）作日常運作及維修用途，大部分路段為單線雙程行車，並不適合大量車輛進入。現時市民及遊客可乘坐的士、新界專線小巴第9A號或預先取得漁護署許可的旅遊巴士前往東壩。

目前周末或公眾假期進出東壩的旅遊巴士配額為每天三個，可供持牌旅行社和學校團體向漁護署申請。自今年二月起至八月，水務署和漁護署接獲的配額申請總數共14宗，除兩宗申請因申請機構未有提供所需資料而未能成功獲批外，其餘已全數獲批出，可見相關配額尚未盡用。

為確保郊野公園的可持續綠色旅遊發展及優質遊客體驗，政府正探討各種可行措施，優化西貢東郊野公園管理及萬宜水庫東壩的交通安排。政府會因應東壩旅遊巴許可證的使用情況，適時檢視旅遊巴許可證的配額。

（五）自今年三月一日正式啓用後，啟德體育園已迅速成為大型體育和娛樂盛事的新據點。過去半年的運作，包括入場、離場及交通等各項安排贏得市民和旅客的正面評價。啟德體育園有限公司（營運公司）一直與政府（包括文化體育及旅遊局、運輸署和香港警務處等）和公共交通營運商保持緊密合作，一方面呼籲來往園區的觀眾盡量乘搭公共交通工具，避免駕駛或乘坐私家車；另一方面不斷優化大型活動期間的交通安排，包括早前推出啟德主場館和啟德體藝館部分泊車位的預約服務，以及為私家車使用者增設啟德青年運動場落車處等新安排。

啟德主場館內有合共約80個旅遊巴泊車位和上落客位，營運公司自開幕以來不斷調整使用泊位的安排。現時營運公司將它們分配作三類安排，首先主要提供予預先安排的跨境旅遊巴士之用。另外，營運公司會配合活動主辦方、售票平台和酒店業界為個別活動推出的旅遊產品，安排預先登記的旅遊巴士服務在該處接載旅客（包括過境或不過境旅客）。第三，營運公司也會與香港酒店業主聯會緊密合作，提供旅遊巴泊位予接駁酒店與啟德主場館的旅遊巴在大型活動開始前，並在預先預約的情況下於該處落客，以配合酒店住客需要。有關安排暢順有序。相關政府部門會聯同營運公司持續檢視運作情況，在不影響活動安排和附近交通的前提下，探討是否有空間擴大上述安排，並延伸至其他非專營巴士服務，進一步提升到訪人士的體驗。"
LCQ9: Facilitation measures for tour group transportation,2025-09-25 12:28,2025-09-25 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500551.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Yiu Pak-leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  Regarding facilitation measures for tour group transportation, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the tourism industry have relayed that visitor experience is negatively affected by the congestion that often occurs at the Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point (BCP), affecting visitor experience, whether the Government has studied implementing short-term traffic mitigation measures at this BCP before the National Day holidays this year, such as allowing tour coaches carrying outbound tour groups to drop off passengers at the departure level, so as to avoid the occurrence of large crowds and vehicle congestions at the ground-level public transport interchange;

(2) as some members of the tourism industry are of the view that the daily average cross-boundary passenger traffic at the Heung Yuen Wai BCP, which is currently the preferred boundary-crossing for most tour groups, has reached three times its design flow, making it an urgent priority to expedite the redevelopment of the Sha Tau Kok BCP to facilitate boundary crossing and transportation for tour groups, and it is learnt that the redeveloped Sha Tau Kok BCP will be positioned as a passenger-only clearance point, of the specific timetable for the relevant works;

(3) given that this year marks the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance, and quite a number of members of the tourism industry have relayed that the restrictions on coach access to Luk Keng Road in the vicinity of Sha Tau Kok hinder tour groups from visiting relics of the War of Resistance, whether the authorities will expedite the improvement of the road's infrastructure facilities; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) as members of the industry have pointed out that the East Dam of High Island Reservoir in Sai Kung is very popular among visitors, but the daily quota of prohibited zone permits issued to coaches with 29 seats or less is limited to only three as the traffic control arrangement, and the application procedures are cumbersome with a very low chance of obtaining an approval on weekends and public holidays when visitor flow is relatively high, making it difficult for the industry to develop tourism products, whether the authorities will further increase the quota for tour coaches entering the East Dam, so as to facilitate the industry in planning tour group itineraries while controlling visitor flow through arrangements by travel agencies to enhance the experience of eco-tourists; and

(5) given the restrictions imposed by the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) during mega events, vehicles holding hire car permits and tour coaches (i.e. non-franchised buses with tour service (A01) endorsement) cannot enter the Main Stadium area, which is not conducive to the development of ""mega event + tourism"" products by the industry, whether the Government will relax the relevant traffic restrictions and introduce a reservation system to allow these two types of licensed vehicles to park at the coach parking spaces under the Main Stadium or other suitable locations in KTSP, thereby enhancing visitor experience?

Reply:

President,

  As the flow of travellers between the Mainland and Hong Kong becomes more frequent, the Government has been closely monitoring the flow of people and vehicles at various land boundary control points (BCPs) and various districts, including tourist hotspots, and coordinating with relevant departments and operators to facilitate crowd control and traffic management arrangements.

  In consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), Environment and Ecology Bureau, Security Bureau and the Transport Department (TD), our reply to the various parts of the question as raised by the Hon Yiu Pak-leung is as follows.

(1) Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point (HYWBCP) is a BCP designed with the concept of ""direct access to people and vehicles"". Since the commissioning of passenger clearance services in February 2023, it has been well-received by cross-boundary travellers, with passenger flow continuing to rise. HYWBCP features ancillary facilities including a public transport interchange (PTI), a pick-up/drop-off (PU/DO) area for tourist coaches, a PU/DO area for cross-boundary coaches (CBCs), a private car PU/DO area, and a public car park to accommodate the different travel patterns and transport needs of cross-boundary travellers. Among others, the PU/DO area includes nine stopping places designated for domestic non-franchised buses (DNFB) (including tourist coaches).

  The TD has been monitoring the usage of the DNFB PU/DO area at the HYWBCP and conducting regular on-site inspections. Located on the ground floor of the HYWBCP, the current arrangement for coaches in using the PU/DO area meets the needs of relevant passengers based on the TD's observations. We note that tourist coaches transporting Mainland tour groups to the HYWBCP for departure primarily use the PU/DO area during afternoon and evening hours. During these periods, the flow of people and vehicles at the PU/DO area is generally smooth with no congestion. Moreover, there are sufficient spare stopping places at the PU/DO area for use by tourist coaches, which were also adequate to meet demand during the Chinese New Year and Golden Week in May this year. Regarding the suggestion in the question to further consider allowing local tourist coaches to use the CBC PU/DO area (located in the departure section on the first floor of the HYWBCP), the road design at that location only permits CBCs to proceed directly to the vehicle inspection booths for departure clearance procedures after dropping off passengers. There are no facilities for vehicles to turn around, making it unsuitable for use by tourist coaches.

  As always, the TD will closely monitor the overall traffic flow at the HYWBCP and the operation of the PU/DO area of tourist coaches during the National Day holiday period in collaboration with the port law enforcement agencies. Where necessary, measures to manage passenger flow will be strengthened and flexible arrangements for picking up/ dropping off activities of tourist coaches will be implemented to ensure smooth overall operations.

(2) To enhance clearance efficiency and promote the development of the Sha Tau Kok (STK) area, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government reached a consensus in 2024 on adopting a cross-river construction approach in the redevelopment of STK Control Point. Accordingly, the two sides will concurrently construct the passenger clearance building straddling the STK River and will take the centre line of the river as the boundary line to set up their respective passenger clearance channels immediately adjacent to each other. The redeveloped STK Control Point will become a passenger clearance-only control point, with the cargo clearance function being cancelled, in order to facilitate the implementation of the ""East in East out, West in West out"" planning strategy for cross-boundary goods traffic, i.e. cross-boundary goods vehicles will have to use the Liantang/Heung Yuen Wai Control Point in the east and the Shenzhen Bay Port in the west, while other land boundary control points will mainly handle passenger traffic. The redeveloped STK Control Point will also implement the collaborative inspection and joint clearance mode to enhance passenger clearance experience and efficiency.

  The engineering feasibility study for the STK Control Point redevelopment project is being undertaken by a consultancy firm engaged by the HKSAR Government and is expected to be completed within 2025. The scope of the study includes such matters as area of land involved for the redevelopment of STK Control Point, road infrastructure, traffic impact assessment, environmental assessment and heritage conservation.

  We understand Shenzhen side is in parallel actively preparing the design tendering and the related feasibility study for the STK Port redevelopment project. The HKSAR Government will continue to closely collaborate with the Shenzhen Municipal Government to actively take forward the redevelopment project.

(3) The Luk Keng Road contains many turns and is narrow. Owing to site constraints and traffic safety considerations, the Luk Keng Road is currently designated as a prohibited zone for vehicles with gross weight over 5.5 tonnes, buses, tourist coaches and public light buses (except for scheduled services). Notwithstanding the above, in view of travel needs associated with tourism development in the area, the TD may issue Prohibited Zone Permits, subject to traffic conditions, allowing tourist coaches with 29 seats or less to travel along Luk Keng Road during off-peak hours, with a view to meeting the needs of general visitors and tour groups. To facilitate the tourism industry to understand the traffic arrangements on Luk Keng Road, the TD has disseminated relevant information, including the application procedures of Prohibited Zone Permits, to the industry via the website of Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong.

  According to the TD's assessment, currently the capacity of Luk Keng Road is sufficient to meet the overall traffic demand, including the demand from vehicles to apply for Prohibited Zone Permits. The TD will continue to closely monitor the traffic conditions in the nearby area and make appropriate arrangements.

(4) The Sai Kung Man Yee Road leading to the High Island Reservoir East Dam is a maintenance access road managed by the Water Supplies Department (WSD), primarily used for daily operations and maintenance by the WSD and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). Most sections of the road are single-lane with two-way traffic, which is not fit for access by a large number of vehicles. Currently, members of the public and visitors can access the East Dam by taxis, the Green Minibus Route No. 9A, or tourist coaches that have obtained prior permission from the AFCD.

  At present, the number of tourist coaches permitted to access East Dam on weekends or public holidays is subject to a quota of three coaches per day for application by licensed travel agencies and school groups. From February to August 2025, the WSD and the AFCD received a total of 14 quota applications. Except for two applications that have been rejected due to the applicants' failure to provide necessary information, all other applications were approved in full, showing that the relevant quota has not been fully utilised yet.

  To ensure sustainable development of green tourism and high-quality visitor experience in country parks, the Government is exploring various feasible measures to enhance the management of Sai Kung East Country Park and traffic arrangements for High Island Reservoir East Dam. The Government will review the quota for tourist coaches for access to East Dam having regard to the utilisation rate of such permits.

(5) Since its official commissioning on March 1 this year, Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) has quickly become a new hub for mega sports and entertainment events. Over the past six months, various arrangements including admission of spectators, crowd dispersal and transportation. have been well-received by members of the public and visitors. The Kai Tak Sports Park Limited (the Operator) has all along been in close collaboration with the Government (including the CSTB, the TD, and the Hong Kong Police Force) and public transport operators. They encourage spectators traveling to the park to use public transport as much as possible and avoid driving or taking private cars. At the same time, they continuously optimise the transport arrangements, such as the recent launch of the pre-booking services for some of the parking spaces at the Kai Tak Stadium (KTS) and the Kai Tak Arena as well as the new designated drop-off point for private car users at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.

  There are approximately 80 coach parking spaces and pick-up /drop-off points in total at the KTS. The Operator has continued fine-tuning their arrangements since the opening of the KTSP. At present, the Operator has allocated them for three types of uses, with the primary use being for pre-arranged cross-boundary coaches. Besides, the Operator will facilitate the travel products for individual events offered by event organisers, ticketing platforms and the hotel industry by arranging pre-registered coach services to pick up passengers (for both cross-boundary and non-cross boundary passengers). Thirdly, the Operator will also collaborate closely with the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners to provide coach parking spaces for shuttle buses connecting hotels and the KTS before major events, allowing passengers to drop off at KTS upon prior registration to meet the needs of hotel guests. The above arrangements have been running smoothly and in an orderly manner. Relevant Government departments will continue to work with the Operator to review the operation of the above arrangements and explore the possibility of expanding the scope to cover other non-franchised bus services to further enhance visitors' experience provided that there will be no adverse impact on event arrangements and the traffic in the vicinity."
立法會十九題：攜帶海味乾貨和燕窩產品進入內地,2025-09-25 12:20,2025-09-25 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500576.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上邵家輝議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

內地農業農村部和海關總署於二○二一年修訂《中華人民共和國禁止攜帶、寄遞進境的動植物及其產品和其他檢疫物名錄》（《名錄》），當中乾製的水生動物產品不在《名錄》的禁止清單內。此外，根據《中華人民共和國限制進出境物品表》（署令第43號），海鮮乾貨如涉及瀕危和珍貴動物，均為限制進境物品，而旅客攜運行李物品進出境，應當以自用合理數量為限。可是，有本港業界人士反映，旅客攜帶海味乾貨過關到內地依然困難，而且燕窩貨品仍被禁止攜帶進入內地，因而減低訪港內地旅客購買有關貨品的意欲。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，現時過關旅客攜帶海味乾貨和燕窩貨品入境內地的實際情況為何，包括如何實施《名錄》規定，以及「自用合理數量」的具體定義；如知悉，詳情為何；如不知悉，特區政府會否向內地相關部門作詳細了解；

（二）過去五年，特區政府有否與內地當局就本港海味乾貨和燕窩貨品可獲豁免攜帶過關的安排進行磋商；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）特區政府會否與內地當局進一步磋商，包括放寬旅客攜帶海味乾貨入境的數量，以及容許旅客可攜帶經本港出售並已檢疫的燕窩貨品入境內地的方案；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

本港法例是按照《瀕危野生動植物種國際貿易公約》（《公約》）來管制動物製產品的出口。而不論是否受《公約》管制的動物製產品，政府均會提供衞生證書簽發服務，協助本地出口商符合進口國家／地方的檢疫衞生要求。

就邵家輝議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）根據內地當局於二○二一年修訂的《中華人民共和國禁止攜帶、寄遞進境的動植物及其產品和其他檢疫物名錄》（《名錄》），內地禁止攜帶或郵寄一系列動植物及其產品和其他檢疫物品入境。當中，燕窩（除經商業無菌處理的罐裝燕窩外）和水生動物產品仍被列於《名錄》內，並禁止以攜帶或郵寄方式進境內地。不涉及瀕危物種的乾製水生動物產品則不在禁止《名錄》內。現時旅客攜帶此類乾製水生動物產品往內地亦無須向政府申請許可證或衞生證書。至於個人旅客攜帶物品的限制，包括何謂「自用合理數量」，屬內地當局的事權和執法人員的判斷。

（二）及（三）就燕窩產品方面，政府和內地當局早年已經簽訂關於旅客購自香港的燕窩產品進入內地聯合檢疫管理方案。漁農自然護理署亦一直積極配合和協助燕窩業界，包括向內地當局推薦符合相關註冊要求的生產企業；以及聯同業界與內地當局舉行會議商討優化執行細節等。

政府會繼續協助本地業界出口動物製產品，並提供相關衞生證書簽發服務。至於就個人旅客攜帶物品的限制，我們亦須尊重不同地區進出口的管制和規範。政府在未來會繼續與內地當局和業界保持聯繫，積極反映業界的訴求和意見。"
LCQ19: Carrying dried seafood and bird's nest products into Mainland,2025-09-25 12:20,2025-09-25 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500581.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

In 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the General Administration of Customs of the Mainland revised the ""Catalog of Animals and Plants, Animal and Plant Products, and Other Quarantine Objects Prohibited from Being Carried, Mailed, or Delivered into the People's Republic of China"" (the Catalog), and dried aquatic animal products are not included in the prohibited list of the Catalog. Moreover, according to the ""List of the People's Republic of China of Articles Restricted from Import and Export"" (Customs Notice No. 43), dried seafood involving endangered and precious animals are articles restricted from import, and such articles carried by visitors in their luggage for import and export should be limited to reasonable quantities for personal use. However, some members of the industry in Hong Kong have relayed that Mainland visitors still encounter difficulties in carrying dried seafood for custom clearance, and bird's nest products remain prohibited from being carried into the Mainland, dampening the desire of Mainland visitors to Hong Kong to purchase such products. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the actual situation of visitors crossing the boundary carrying dried seafood and bird's nest products into the Mainland at present, including how the provisions of the Catalog are implemented and the specific definition of ""reasonable quantities for personal use""; if so, of the details; if not, whether the SAR Government will gain a detailed understanding from the relevant Mainland authorities;

(2) whether, in the past five years, the SAR Government has discussed with the Mainland authorities the arrangements for exempting Hong Kong dried seafood and bird's nest products from customs clearance; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the SAR Government will further discuss with the Mainland authorities, including relaxing the quantity of dried seafood that visitors are allowed to carry into the Mainland and the proposal to allow visitors to carry quarantine bird's nest products sold in Hong Kong into the Mainland; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Hong Kong legislation regulates the export of animal products in accordance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). For animal products (whether regulated under CITES), the Government provides sanitary certification services to assist local exporters in meeting the quarantine and sanitary requirements of importing countries/places.

The reply to the question from the Hon Shiu Ka-fai is as follows:

(1) According to the ""Catalogue of Animals and Plants, Animal and Plant Products and other Quarantine Objects Prohibited from being Carried or Mailed into the People's Republic of China"" (the Catalogue) revised by the Mainland authorities in 2021, the Mainland prohibits the carrying or mailing of a range of animals, plants, and their products, as well as other quarantine objects into the Mainland. Among others, bird's nest (except commercially sterilised canned bird's nest products) and aquatic animal products are still listed in the Catalogue and cannot be carried or mailed into the Mainland. Dried aquatic animal products not involving endangered species are not under the prohibited Catalogue. At present, passengers carrying such dried aquatic animal products to the Mainland do not need to apply for permits or sanitary/health certificates from the HKSAR Government. As regards the restriction on personal items that individual travellers can carry, including the definition of ""reasonable quantity for personal use"", falls under the jurisdiction of the Mainland authorities and the judgment of law enforcement officers.

(2) & (3) Regarding bird's nest products, the HKSAR Government and the Mainland authorities in earlier years signed a joint quarantine management plan for bird's nest products purchased by travellers in Hong Kong and brought into the Mainland. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has been actively collaborating and assisting the trade by recommending manufacturers that meet the relevant registration requirements to the Mainland authorities, and holding meetings with the trade and the Mainland authorities to discuss optimising the implementation details.

The HKSAR Government will continue to assist the local trade in exporting animal products through our services in issuing relevant sanitary/health certificates. As regards restrictions on personal items carried by individual travellers, we need to respect the import and export control and regulations of different regions. The HKSAR Government will continue to maintain communication with the Mainland authorities and the trade, and actively convey the trade's demands and views."

Special traffic and transport arrangements for Kai Tak Stadium concerts on September 27 and 28,2025-09-25 12:15,2025-09-25 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500561.htm," The Transport Department (TD) today (September 25) said that special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented to facilitate the holding of concerts at Kai Tak Stadium on the evenings of September 27 and 28. As traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, concertgoers should opt for public transport and avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

 The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the frequency of trains on the Tuen Ma Line. The last MTR train to Lo Wu Station via interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line will depart from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm. Franchised bus companies will provide 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange (route No. SP12), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and Airport (route No. A25S), and major districts across the territory.

 Concertgoers who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day may also take the KTSP's cross-boundary coach services during dispersal. Passengers should purchase tickets from the operators' online platforms in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal.

 The Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (2pm to 6.30pm) and suspended for taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid the outflux of spectators, and passengers' patience is appreciated.

 Spectators are advised to heed real-time information via the on-site broadcast and the ""Easy Leave"" platform (easyleave.police.gov.hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application and radio and television broadcasts."
SFST proceeds to Poland after concluding visit to Slovenia (with photos),2025-09-25 12:03,2025-09-25 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500394.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, met with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Slovenia, Mr Klemen BoštjanÄiÄ, again in the morning of September 24 (Ljubljana time) before proceeding to Poland for the second leg of his European visit. He said at the meeting that the visit was very fruitful, especially regarding the news that the Slovenian Government and National Assembly are deliberating on the decision to prioritise the Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (CDTA) negotiations with Hong Kong.

  ""Both the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Slovenian governments are keen to pursue a CDTA early to reduce unnecessary tax obstacles for encouraging bilateral trade and investment. The signing of the CDTA will foster closer economic ties between Hong Kong and Slovenia, and I believe that it will be welcomed by the business communities in both places.

  ""Hong Kong and Slovenia have a lot in common, both being small yet significant economically and strategically with big ambitions. We both offer a diverse economy with a stable investment environment, underpinned by openness and efficiency. That makes us each perfect gateways for each other, enabling European enterprises to enter Asian and Mainland markets through Hong Kong, and Slovenia a place through which Mainland companies can access Europe,"" he added.

  Mr Hui also highlighted to Mr BoštjanÄiÄ that Hong Kong is consolidating its status as an international asset and wealth management centre. The total assets under management in Hong Kong grew by 13 per cent year on year, reaching EUR3.81 trillion by the end of 2024. Riding on the particularly stellar performance in the private banking and private wealth management sector, more facilitation measures have been announced by the Chief Executive in his 2025 Policy Address to make Hong Kong even more attractive to family offices and global high-net-worth individuals. These measures include enriching the investment options under the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, enhancing the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and carried interest, as well as expanding the mutual access between capital markets of the Mainland and Hong Kong.

  He also met with the State Secretary responsible for Taxes, Customs Duties and Other Charges and for Improving the Efficiency of Public Spending of Slovenia, Ms Katja BoÅ¾iÄ, to discuss the next steps in the process of commencing the negotiations on the CDTA.

  In the afternoon, Mr Hui started his itinerary in Warsaw, Poland, where he visited Lenovo Technology and met with its General Manager at Lenovo Poland, Mr Wojciech Zaskorski, and other senior members of the company to learn more about the macroeconomic situation and digitalisation of Poland, as well as the needs of Mainland companies in their expansion overseas.

  Mr Hui stated that Hong Kong is striving to be the perfect platform to support Mainland companies going global. A Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global will be set up to encourage Mainland enterprises to utilise Hong Kong in expanding their businesses overseas. Hong Kong will facilitate the establishment in the city of more corporate treasury centres by Mainland companies and regional headquarters by the banking sector, particularly by Mainland banks. Hong Kong will also promote the development of carbon audit services to assist enterprises going global to meet international requirements and standards on green trade in respect of carbon emission reduction.

  He reiterated that Hong Kong has an extensive pool of professionals to serve Mainland companies on their journey towards global market expansion. Using the accounting sector as an example, he said that the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has compiled the List of accounting firms helping Mainland enterprises go global to help Mainland companies to tackle thechallenges of venturing abroad. As at mid-August, the list includes 83 Hong Kong accounting firms.

  Mr Hui will visit the Warsaw Stock Exchange on September 25 (Warsaw time) and meet with Polish government officials and members of the business sector."

「香港特別行政區政府與斯洛文尼亞政府均積極尋求早日簽訂全面性協定，減少不必要的稅務障礙，以鼓勵雙邊貿易和投資。簽署全面性協定有助香港和斯洛文尼亞建立更緊密的經濟聯繫，我相信兩地商界會對此表示歡迎。」

他補充說：「香港和斯洛文尼亞有着不少共通之處，兩地面積雖小，但同樣目光遠大，佔有重要的經濟和戰略地位。此外，兩地均擁有多元化的經濟體系，奉行開放和高效政策並具備穩定的投資環境，讓我們成為彼此的理想門戶，助力歐洲企業通過香港進入亞洲和中國巿場，與此同時，中國企業亦可由此走進歐洲巿場。」

許正宇特別向Klemen Boštjančič提到，香港正鞏固其作為國際資產和財富管理中心的地位。香港管理的資產總值在二○二四年年底達到3.81萬億歐元，按年增加13%。乘着私人銀行和私人財富管理領域亮麗的表現，行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布更多便利措施，包括豐富「新資本投資者入境計劃」下的投資選項，優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠稅制，以及擴大內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通，以加大香港對家族辦公室和全球高資產淨值人士的吸引力。

他其後亦與斯洛文尼亞主管稅務、關稅及其他費用及提升公共支出效能的部長Katja Božič會面，討論日後啓動全面性協定磋商的後續工作。

下午，許正宇展開波蘭的訪問行程，在華沙參觀聯想科技，與聯想波蘭分公司總經理Wojciech Zaskorski和其他高層會面，了解波蘭的宏觀經濟和數字化，以及內地企業拓展海外業務的需求。

許正宇表示，香港致力成為支持內地企業「走出去」的理想平台。香港將成立內地企業出海專班，鼓勵內地企業利用香港拓展海外業務。香港亦將推動更多內地企業特別是內地銀行在香港設立地區總部，並在香港設立企業財資中心。同時，香港會積極推動碳排放核算服務的發展，助力「出海」企業滿足國際對綠色貿易的減排要求和標準。

他重申，香港擁有豐富的專業人才資源，在內地企業拓展全球市場時提供可靠支援。以會計界為例，香港會計師公會編制了一份「助力中國企業『出海』會計師事務所名單」，旨在幫助內地企業應對拓展海外市場時遇到的挑戰。截至八月中，名單上已有83家香港會計師事務所。

九月二十五日（華沙時間），許正宇將訪問華沙證券交易所，並與波蘭政府官員和商界人士會面。"
​第五屆學校推薦直接錄取計劃十月接受報名,2025-09-25 12:00,2025-09-25 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500493.htm,"教育局今日（九月二十五日）宣布，第五屆學校推薦直接錄取計劃（直接錄取計劃）將開放予將應考二○二六年香港中學文憑考試（文憑試），並於同年九月升讀學士學位課程的本地中六學生報名參加。

教育局發言人說：「直接錄取計劃自二○二二／二三學年起推行，旨在認同一些在特定範疇具有過人才能，而有關才能未必能透過文憑試獲全面評核的學生。計劃讓具特殊或多元才華的學生與切合他們潛能的課程互相配對，提供機會讓本港大學考慮直接錄取。」

第五屆直接錄取計劃的提名期為二○二五年十月九日至十二月三日，有意透過計劃報讀心儀學科的學生須獲其就讀中學推薦。每間本地中學可推薦兩名在個別學科／範疇具有特殊才華及興趣的學生參與計劃。每名獲推薦的學生可報讀一個參與計劃的指定大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助學士學位課程。

參與直接錄取計劃的大學將會為所有獲推薦的學生安排面試，並於二○二六年文憑試成績公布前，向成功申請的學生發出「直接錄取」通知。

八所教資會資助大學已指定超過300個公帑資助學士學位課程參與第五屆直接錄取計劃，並為個別課程訂下不以文憑試成績為基礎的收生準則。有關直接錄取計劃的詳情及個別參與課程的具體入讀要求，已上載至計劃網頁（www.edb.gov.hk/tc/edu-system/postsecondary/policy-doc/SNDAS/index.html）。

教育局補充，直接錄取計劃旨在為具有特定過人才能的學生提供多一個升讀大學的途徑。獲推薦參與直接錄取計劃的學生須與一般中六學生一樣，同時循一般途徑透過大學聯合招生辦法報讀大學課程，並如期赴考文憑試，以免限制升學機會。

 為提倡多元卓越文化，民政及青年事務局由二○二五／二六學年起推行多元發展獎學金，由華人永遠墳場管理委員會贊助，獎勵於直接錄取計劃下獲大學錄取且在藝術、體育及╱或社會服務方面表現傑出的學生。八所教資會資助大學除了對各自經直接錄取計劃正式錄取的學生發出「直接錄取」通知外，亦可提名當中在藝術、體育及／或社會服務方面表現超卓者獲取獎學金。提名名額將根據各大學於直接錄取計劃下的收生人數按比例分配。每名獲獎者可無須通過經濟狀況審查而在四年修業期內每年獲發放10,000元獎學金。大學可自行甄選並提名獎學金計劃的獲獎者。

教育局於二○一七年十一月成立學校課程檢討專責小組，整體檢視中小學課程。專責小組於二○二○年九月向教育局提交的檢討報告中提出六個方向性建議，當中包括推行全新的直接錄取計劃，以提高大學收生靈活度。教育局接納了專責小組的建議，並由二○二二／二三學年起推行直接錄取計劃。"
Fifth cohort of School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme opens for applications in October,2025-09-25 12:00,2025-09-25 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500500.htm,"  The Education Bureau (EDB) today (September 25) announced that the fifth cohort of the School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme (SNDAS) will be open for applications by local Secondary Six students who will be taking the 2026 Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examination and commencing their undergraduate studies in September 2026.

A spokesman for the EDB said, ""Launched in the 2022/23 academic year, the SNDAS is a scheme that recognises the exceptional talents of students in specific disciplines that may not be fully assessed by the HKDSE Examination by allowing students with special and diversified talents to be matched with programmes that suit their potential. It provides opportunities for these students to be considered for direct admission to local universities.""

The nomination period for the fifth cohort of the SNDAS will run from October 9 to December 3, 2025. Students who intend to apply for their preferred programmes through the SNDAS must be nominated by their secondary schools. Each local secondary school can nominate two students with exceptional talents and interests in specific disciplines/areas, and each student nominee can apply for admission to one designated University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded undergraduate programme participating in the SNDAS.

Participating universities will arrange interviews for all students nominated for the SNDAS and make firm offers to successful students prior to the release of the 2026 HKDSE Examination results.

The eight UGC-funded universities have designated over 300 publicly funded undergraduate programmes to participate in the fifth cohort of the SNDAS and set admission criteria that are not based on HKDSE Examination results for individual programmes. Details of the SNDAS and specific admission requirements of the participating programmes have been uploaded to the scheme's website (www.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/postsecondary/policy-doc/SNDAS/index.html).

The EDB adds that the SNDAS was introduced to provide an additional pathway to university for students with exceptional talents. Those nominated for the SNDAS, like other Secondary Six students, are required to apply for admission to universities through the Joint University Programmes Admissions System in parallel and to sit for the HKDSE Examinations, ensuring they do not limit their opportunities for further studies.

  To promote a culture of multifaceted excellence, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau launched the Multi-talent Development Scholarship (MDS) in the 2025/26 academic year, funded by the Board of Management of the Chinese Permanent Cemeteries, for admittees of the SNDAS demonstrating outstanding achievements in arts, sports and/or community service on top of the firm offers made under the SNDAS. Among the students being formally admitted to their respective universities under the SNDAS, each of the eight UGC-funded universities will be invited to nominate SNDAS admittees demonstrating outstanding performance in arts, sports and/or community service for the award of the scholarships in addition to the firm offers made. The quotas of scholarship nominations will be distributed proportionally, having regard to the number of students admitted to each university by the SNDAS. Each awardee, not subject to means testing, will be granted a scholarship of $10,000 per year across his/her four-year tuition period. The universities shall enjoy the autonomy to select and nominate awardees for the MDS.

The EDB set up the Task Force on Review of School Curriculum in November 2017 to holistically review the primary and secondary curricula. The review report submitted by the Task Force to the EDB in September 2020 put forward six directional recommendations, including the implementation of a new direct admission scheme to enhance flexibility in university admissions. The EDB accepted the recommendation and introduced the SNDAS starting with the 2022/23 academic year."

A Strong Foundationamid Global Shifts

Hostingthis forumin HongKongis very timely.This year, Hong Kong has once again captured the attention of globalinvestors. In a world marked bygeopoliticaltensions and rising unilateralism, international investors are increasingly seeking to diversify their asset allocations. At the same time, Chinesetechenterpriseslike Deep Seekhave inspired renewed optimism about theregion'stechnological prowessandinvestment prospects. Capital is flowinginbecauseHong Kong isbothasafe heaven and a market offering superior returns.Our stock marketisreflectingthis momentum.

Yet, what is often less highlighted is our fixed income and currency (FIC) market, which also offerscompelling prospects. In fact,the Asianinternational bond market has been flourishing inrecent years, with issuance volumes growingon averageat 16 per cent per annumover the past 15 years. This far outpaces the global average of less than 4 per cent.

Hong Kong is a leaderinthisspace.Last year, international bond issuance here exceeded US$130 billion.In fact,in 9 out ofthe past10 years, Hong Kong toppedAsiaandcapturednearly 30%ofthe regionalmarket.Even more impressively, 45% of the region's green and sustainable bondswere arranged by us.

It helps that Hong Kong is the world's largest offshore RMB hub.We processedover RMB 3 trillioninpaymentsdailyin 2024, andmaintain the deepest RMB liquidity pool outside the Chinese Mainland. Thisis becoming a key pillarof Hong Kong's vibrant foreign exchange market, which now ranks fourth globally.

As RMB gains traction as a trade,investment andreserve currency, global investors are seeking more investmentproductsand risk managementtoolsdenominated in RMB. Hong Kong isactively seizing these opportunities.

With the strong support from the Central Authorities, Hong Kong has become the offshorecentrefor RMB sovereign bonds. The Ministry of Finance has issued RMB sovereign bonds in Hong Kong for 17 years in a row, with cumulativevalue exceeding RMB 410 billion. Moreover,Mainlandprovinces and municipalities, such as Hainan,Guangdongand Shenzhen, have also issued bonds here to support their sustainable development. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is also increasing theissuanceof RMB-denominated bonds, which account for more than 20% of all bondsthatwe have issued thus far.

The dim sum bond marketin Hong Kongis also thriving, reachingRMB 1 trillion last year, doublingthatof2021.In addition, the diversity of issuers is expanding. A notable example is the RMB 2 billion3-year bondissuedby the Development Bank of Kazakhstanearlier this month. It is the first of its kind by a government in Central Asia.

These encouraging developments areenriching Hong Kong’s fixed income ecosystem, including the growth of products like fixed income ETFs, the product suiteof whichisalsoexpanding, providing exposure to US Treasuries, Chinese government bonds, Asian bonds,green bonds, and more.

Above all, Hong Kong'sFICmarketoffers a uniquevalue preposition. Under the""one country, two systems"" framework, we uphold the free flow of capital and information.Our currencyispegged to the US dollarwith a relatively stable exchange rate, and itis freely convertible.At the same time,we have establishedmutual market access arrangements with the Chinese Mainland. Together, these strengthsgiveglobal issuers and investorsaccess to deep liquidity in an efficient, familiar and trusted environment.

Breaking New Groundin a Changing Landscape

Looking ahead, Hong Kong is committed to building an even more vibrant FIC ecosystem,one that creates lastingvalue and new opportunities for international issuers and investors.Tothis end, we are driving forwardon threefronts.

First,we areenhancing market infrastructure. This includes strengthening the platforms for custody, management and trading of FIC products, while deepening our connectivity with global financial partners.

As announced in the Policy Address last week, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will collaborate to explorecentralisedasset management and cross-collateralisationof assets on a single platform. Our goal is to develop a globally competitive, multi-asset class custodial infrastructure, presenting investors with the opportunity to better manage their assets andoptimisetheir value. For example, such assets could becollateralisedto provide liquidity and enable derivative products to be developed. This arrangementwill bemadeavailable also to assets under the various mutual market access schemes.

In parallel, theSecurities and Futures Commissionisexploring the feasibility ofcreating anelectronic bond trading platformto bebuilt and operated by market participants. It is aimed at broadeningparticipation andenhancingmarketefficiency, transparency and resilience.

On the international front, we are actively seeking cross-border collaboration on debt securities depository and settlementwith more global partners, including the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Switzerland.

Second,we arestrengthening market liquidity and expanding productofferings. We are committed to broadening theFIC productissuer base and encouraging more corporates to raisefundsthroughHong Kong's bond market.

Oneexampleisthe establishmentofacommercial repo market and a central counterparty regime, both of which willenhancesecondary market liquidity.We are also working to expand the use of offshore Chinese Government bonds as collateral across different clearing houses. In this connection, the HKMA and the SFC will jointly promote the development of a market-based CNH yield curve, particularly at the long end.

The offshore RMB market continues to present significant potential. We are activelyproviding liquidity support,exploringmore use cases of RMB and encouraging the development of RMB-denominated investment and risk management products. As part ofsuchefforts,the HKMA is providingbanks in Hong Kong witha trade finance liquidity facilityofRMB 100 billion.We willalsocontinue toexpand anddeepen mutual market access schemes with theMainland. This willfurther enrich the product offerings available to both Mainland and international investors.

Third, embracingfinancialinnovation.Tokenisationof real-world assets, including bonds and other financial instruments, isopening up exciting new frontiers in the FIC market.

We are leading by example. Over the past two years, the Government has issued two pioneering tranches oftokenisedgreen bonds, making us the first government in the world to do so. Preparation for a third tranche isalreadyunder wayandwe plan toregularisethis.

Another example, of course, istheHKMA's Project Ensemble, which provides a sandbox to test thetokenisationof traditional financial products, including money market funds and others. The SFC hasalsobeen working with the HKMA to promote the wider adoption oftokenisationin the asset management industry.

On the private market side, the SFCauthorisedAsia's first batch of threetokenisedretail money market funds earlier this year.As of June this year, these three funds reached a combined AUM of US$350 million,with a74% quarter-on-quarter growth.In July, two moretokenisedretail money market funds were approved, further demonstrating the market's growing appetite forsuch products.

The Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap

Ladies and gentlemen, later today, the SFC and the HKMA will jointly release the Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap, which outlines10initiatives across four focus areas: boosting primary market issuance, enhancing secondary market liquidity, expanding offshore RMB business, and building next-generation market infrastructure.

This roadmaprepresents a shared commitmentbetween the public and private sectors to reinforce Hong Kong's role as a premier FIC hub, ensuring that our markets remain competitive, inclusive, and globally connected.

A Call to Collaboration

The journey to building a world-class, globally competitive FIC market cannot be undertaken by any one party alone. While the Government and regulators can lay the foundation, it is the market—issuers, investors, and intermediaries—that must bring it to life.

So today, I invite all of you to join us on this journey. Let us work together to unlock the full potential of Hong Kong's FICmarkets, and to shape the future of finance in the region and beyond.

Thank you once again for joining us at this inaugural FIC Forum. I wish you all a productive, insightful, and rewarding event, and the best of business and health in the time ahead."

Hong Kong is a leaderinthisspace.Last year, international bond issuance here exceeded US$130 billion.In fact,in 9 out ofthe past10 years, Hong Kong toppedAsiaandcapturednearly 30%ofthe regionalmarket.Even more impressively, 45% of the region's green and sustainable bondswere arranged by us.

It helps that Hong Kong is the world's largest offshore RMB hub.We processedover RMB 3 trillioninpaymentsdailyin 2024, andmaintain the deepest RMB liquidity pool outside the Chinese Mainland. Thisis becoming a key pillarof Hong Kong's vibrant foreign exchange market, which now ranks fourth globally.

As RMB gains traction as a trade,investment andreserve currency, global investors are seeking more investmentproductsand risk managementtoolsdenominated in RMB. Hong Kong isactively seizing these opportunities.

With the strong support from the Central Authorities, Hong Kong has become the offshorecentrefor RMB sovereign bonds. The Ministry of Finance has issued RMB sovereign bonds in Hong Kong for 17 years in a row, with cumulativevalue exceeding RMB 410 billion. Moreover,Mainlandprovinces and municipalities, such as Hainan,Guangdongand Shenzhen, have also issued bonds here to support their sustainable development. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is also increasing theissuanceof RMB-denominated bonds, which account for more than 20% of all bondsthatwe have issued thus far.

The dim sum bond marketin Hong Kongis also thriving, reachingRMB 1 trillion last year, doublingthatof2021.In addition, the diversity of issuers is expanding. A notable example is the RMB 2 billion3-year bondissuedby the Development Bank of Kazakhstanearlier this month. It is the first of its kind by a government in Central Asia.

These encouraging developments areenriching Hong Kong’s fixed income ecosystem, including the growth of products like fixed income ETFs, the product suiteof whichisalsoexpanding, providing exposure to US Treasuries, Chinese government bonds, Asian bonds,green bonds, and more.

Above all, Hong Kong'sFICmarketoffers a uniquevalue preposition. Under the""one country, two systems"" framework, we uphold the free flow of capital and information.Our currencyispegged to the US dollarwith a relatively stable exchange rate, and itis freely convertible.At the same time,we have establishedmutual market access arrangements with the Chinese Mainland. Together, these strengthsgiveglobal issuers and investorsaccess to deep liquidity in an efficient, familiar and trusted environment.

Breaking New Groundin a Changing Landscape

Looking ahead, Hong Kong is committed to building an even more vibrant FIC ecosystem,one that creates lastingvalue and new opportunities for international issuers and investors.Tothis end, we are driving forwardon threefronts.

First,we areenhancing market infrastructure. This includes strengthening the platforms for custody, management and trading of FIC products, while deepening our connectivity with global financial partners.

As announced in the Policy Address last week, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will collaborate to explorecentralisedasset management and cross-collateralisationof assets on a single platform. Our goal is to develop a globally competitive, multi-asset class custodial infrastructure, presenting investors with the opportunity to better manage their assets andoptimisetheir value. For example, such assets could becollateralisedto provide liquidity and enable derivative products to be developed. This arrangementwill bemadeavailable also to assets under the various mutual market access schemes.

In parallel, theSecurities and Futures Commissionisexploring the feasibility ofcreating anelectronic bond trading platformto bebuilt and operated by market participants. It is aimed at broadeningparticipation andenhancingmarketefficiency, transparency and resilience.

On the international front, we are actively seeking cross-border collaboration on debt securities depository and settlementwith more global partners, including the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Switzerland.

Second,we arestrengthening market liquidity and expanding productofferings. We are committed to broadening theFIC productissuer base and encouraging more corporates to raisefundsthroughHong Kong's bond market.

Oneexampleisthe establishmentofacommercial repo market and a central counterparty regime, both of which willenhancesecondary market liquidity.We are also working to expand the use of offshore Chinese Government bonds as collateral across different clearing houses. In this connection, the HKMA and the SFC will jointly promote the development of a market-based CNH yield curve, particularly at the long end.

The offshore RMB market continues to present significant potential. We are activelyproviding liquidity support,exploringmore use cases of RMB and encouraging the development of RMB-denominated investment and risk management products. As part ofsuchefforts,the HKMA is providingbanks in Hong Kong witha trade finance liquidity facilityofRMB 100 billion.We willalsocontinue toexpand anddeepen mutual market access schemes with theMainland. This willfurther enrich the product offerings available to both Mainland and international investors.

Third, embracingfinancialinnovation.Tokenisationof real-world assets, including bonds and other financial instruments, isopening up exciting new frontiers in the FIC market.

We are leading by example. Over the past two years, the Government has issued two pioneering tranches oftokenisedgreen bonds, making us the first government in the world to do so. Preparation for a third tranche isalreadyunder wayandwe plan toregularisethis.

Another example, of course, istheHKMA's Project Ensemble, which provides a sandbox to test thetokenisationof traditional financial products, including money market funds and others. The SFC hasalsobeen working with the HKMA to promote the wider adoption oftokenisationin the asset management industry.

On the private market side, the SFCauthorisedAsia's first batch of threetokenisedretail money market funds earlier this year.As of June this year, these three funds reached a combined AUM of US$350 million,with a74% quarter-on-quarter growth.In July, two moretokenisedretail money market funds were approved, further demonstrating the market's growing appetite forsuch products.

The Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap

Ladies and gentlemen, later today, the SFC and the HKMA will jointly release the Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap, which outlines10initiatives across four focus areas: boosting primary market issuance, enhancing secondary market liquidity, expanding offshore RMB business, and building next-generation market infrastructure.

This roadmaprepresents a shared commitmentbetween the public and private sectors to reinforce Hong Kong's role as a premier FIC hub, ensuring that our markets remain competitive, inclusive, and globally connected.

A Call to Collaboration

The journey to building a world-class, globally competitive FIC market cannot be undertaken by any one party alone. While the Government and regulators can lay the foundation, it is the market—issuers, investors, and intermediaries—that must bring it to life.

So today, I invite all of you to join us on this journey. Let us work together to unlock the full potential of Hong Kong's FICmarkets, and to shape the future of finance in the region and beyond.

Thank you once again for joining us at this inaugural FIC Forum. I wish you all a productive, insightful, and rewarding event, and the best of business and health in the time ahead."

答覆：

主席：

就邱達根議員的提問，經諮詢相關決策局後，我現回覆如下。

（一）及（二）香港積極建設蓬勃的人工智能（AI）生態，在過去數年進行了周密布局及落實全方位措施。

繼去年提出「人工智能+」行動，國家在今年八月發布《關於深入實施「人工智能+」行動的意見》（《意見》），推動與經濟社會各行業及領域的深度融合。

為了推進本港AI+發展，二○二五年《施政報告》大力拓展AI應用，賦能產業，同時鞏固香港在AI科研、人才、資金、數據等方面的優勢。譬如在科研方面，我們正爭取立法會撥款10億元，於二○二六年成立「香港人工智能研發院」，促進AI上游研發、中下游成果轉化及開拓應用場景。為數30億元的「前沿科技研究支援計劃」亦即將推出，支持本地資助院校吸引AI等方面的國際科研頂尖人物來港。

在資金方面，我們將啓動「創科產業引導基金」，積極引導市場投資包括AI在內的策略性新興和未來產業；而港投公司（香港投資管理有限公司）作為政府全資擁有的「耐心資本」機構，亦會繼續投資AI企業，支持AI產業發展。

至於算力設施，數碼港人工智能超算中心將提升算力，而30億元人工智能資助計劃亦已批出十多個項目，推動科研和大規模AI應用。我們亦會於短期內推出北區沙嶺約10公頃數據園區發展用地作市場招標，提供先進算力設施，推動AI相關產業發展。

在人才培訓方面，政府在「優質教育基金」下預留20億元支援中小學數字教育，並會制定數字教育藍圖，包括訂定「AI素養」學習架構。政府亦會聯同專業團體推行AI教育先導計劃，加強教師AI培訓，並陸續推出「電子學習配套計劃」，向學校提供包括AI的數字平台及工具。

AI應用是推動「AI+」行動的重中之重。除了在公務及不同界別開拓更多AI應用場景外，我們亦會優化「數碼轉型支援先導計劃」，資助中小企應用AI方案，促進「AI產業化、產業AI化」。

（三）AI發展須以安全為舵，以應用為帆。數據作為AI技術的核心要素，其安全、開放和共享是「AI+」發展的先決條件。

我們的政策目標是促進數據「管」、「用」有機結合，平衡數據為本的AI發展的需要和風險。數字政策辦公室已發布《人工智能道德框架》、《數據治理原則》，以及《香港生成式人工智能技術及應用指引》，為開發、設計、處理及安全使用AI服務提供指引及建議，並提倡數據流通及安全應用。

針對跨境數據，我們在《促進粵港澳大灣區數據跨境流動的合作備忘錄》的基礎上推出了「標準合同」便利措施，促進數據安全有序跨境流動。我們也會積極探討內地數據合規安全流動到河套香港園區用於科研，助力AI創新。

因應AI的發展，個人資料私隱專員公署發布了各項指引，提供有關AI管治和保障個人資料私隱的建議。律政司亦將成立跨部門工作小組，檢視更廣泛應用AI所需的法律配套。

政府會繼續留意AI的發展趨勢和香港所需，採取多軌並行的策略，優化本港的數據治理，在確保安全的前提下，充分發揮AI+的發展潛力。"
LCQ2: Alignment with country's efforts in promoting artificial intelligence development,2025-09-25 11:45,2025-09-25 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500554.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Duncan Chiu and a reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  The Opinions on Deeply Implementing the ""AI+"" Initiative (""the Opinions"") issued last month by the State Council proposed accelerating implementation of six key actions and reinforcing eight fundamental support capabilities in order to enable all the people to share in the dividends of artificial intelligence (""AI"") development. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will study in depth the specific content of the Opinions and the ensuing opportunities and challenges for Hong Kong, and explore how Hong Kong should align and dovetail with the actions proposed in the Opinions, as well as its proposed drive towards reinforcing fundamental support capabilities, including formulation of specific plans and timetables, so as to support the country in achieving the objectives set out in the Opinions;

(2) whether it has reviewed Hong Kong's strategy, as well as its effectiveness, in promoting AI development, including areas requiring enhancement and optimisation in terms of policy support, technological innovation, talent training, capital chain, application scenario, community awareness and so on; and

(3) whether it will formulate comprehensive regulations for data protection and governance, including data security legislation, to ensure the secure and effective access, transmission and use of data, particularly cross-boundary data exchange and flow, and establish an internationally aligned data flow mechanism to realise Hong Kong's goal of becoming an international data hub?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the relevant bureaux, my reply to the questions raised by the Hon Duncan Chiu is as follows:

(1) & (2) Hong Kong has been taking proactive steps to build a vibrant artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, having conducted meticulous planning and implemented comprehensive measures over the past few years.

Following the launch of the ""AI Plus"" initiative last year, our motherland issued in August this year the ""Opinions on Deepening the Implementation of the 'AI Plus' Initiative"" (the Opinions), with a view to promoting the close integration of AI with various industries and sectors of the economy and society.

To advance Hong Kong's ""AI Plus"" development, the 2025 Policy Address advocates the broadening of AI applications to empower industries while consolidating Hong Kong's strengths in AI research, talent, funding and data, etc.For example, in terms of research, we are seeking a provision of $1 billion from the Legislative Council for the establishment of the Hong Kong Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute (AIRDI) in 2026, which will facilitate upstream AI research and development (R&D), midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes, as well as expansion of use cases. The $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme will also be launched shortly to help local subsidised institutions in attracting top-notch international scientific researchers in areas such as AI to Hong Kong.

In respect of financing, the Government will launch the Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund to proactively channel market capital to invest in emerging and future industries of strategic importance including AI. The Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited as a wholly government-owned ""patient capital"" institution will continue to invest in AI enterprises to support the development of the AI industry.

As regards computing facilities, Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre will enhance its computing power, and the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme has already approved over ten projects to fuel scientific research and large-scale AI applications. We will also put up for tender a site of about 10 hectares at Sandy Ridge in the North District soon for the development of a data facility cluster, providing advanced computing power facilities and promoting the development of AI-related industries.

Regarding talent development, in addition to setting aside $2 billion in the Quality Education Fund to support digital education for primary and secondary schools, the Government will formulate a Blueprint for Digital Education, including establishing an ""AI literacy"" learning framework. Besides, the Government will collaborate with professional bodies to roll out pilot schemes on AI education and enhance AI-related training for teachers. Digital platforms and tools equipped with AI will also be launched progressively under the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme for schools.

AI application is key in taking forward the ""AI Plus"" initiative. In addition to expanding AI application scenarios in public services and various sectors, we will also enhance the Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to provide small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with subsidies to apply AI solutions, thereby promoting ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"".

(3) The development of AI must be steered by safety and driven by application. As the core element of AI technology, the security, openness and sharing of data are pre-requisites for ""AI Plus"" development.

Our policy objective is to foster proper data management and data usage, balancing the needs and risks of data-driven AI development. The Digital Policy Office has released the Ethical AI Framework, the Principles of Data Governance and the Hong Kong Generative AI Technical and Application Guideline, providing guidance and recommendations for the development, design, processing and secure use of AI services, while advocating data flow and secure application.

Regarding cross-boundary data, we have introduced the ""Standard Contract"" facilitation measure based on the ""Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"" to facilitate the safe and orderly cross-boundary flow of data. We will also proactively explore the compliant and secure flow of Mainland data to the Hong Kong Park in the Loop for scientific research purposes, supporting AI application testing and innovation.

In view of the AI development, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has released various guidelines, providing recommendations on AI governance and personal data privacy protection. The Department of Justice will also establish an inter-departmental working group to review the legislation needed to support a wider application of AI.

The Government will continue to monitor AI development trends and the needs of Hong Kong, adopting a multi-pronged strategy to enhance the data governance of Hong Kong, thereby fully unleashing the development potential of ""AI Plus"" on the premise of ensuring safety."

​立法會二十二題：推廣應用學習科目,2025-09-25 11:34,2025-09-25 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500466.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上梁文廣議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆︰

問題：

應用學習作為高中課程的選修科目之一，着重實用性和與不同職業領域聯繫的學習元素，是本港中學課程連接及推動職業專才（職專）教育的重要組成部分。有意見認為，隨着國家與特區政府越來越重視職專教育，加上第二所應用科學大學（應科大）已於去年十一月成立，高中的應用學習科目與應科大有更好的結合。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）二○二五年香港中學文憑考試（文憑試）的應用學習科目考試的總報考人數為7 891人，但各科目的考生人數分布極不平均，其中最受歡迎的「甜品及咖啡店營運」考生接近1 000人，惟超過一半科目的考生人數不足100人，其中「電腦鑑證科技」更無人報考，當局有否評估某些科目較受考生歡迎或不受歡迎的原因為何；

（二）自應用學習科目設立至今，當局如何評估該科目的成效；除了其在文憑試中的報考人數外，當局有否制訂其他績效指標；

（三）當局會否考慮重新檢視應用學習科目的成效，例如該科目能否實質提升學生的求職技能，以進一步整合該科目和現有資源，從而提升課程質素；

（四）鑑於有意見認為，應用學習科目在文憑試的評核較甲類高中科目簡單，當局有否考慮應用學習科目的評核採用甲類高中科目的水平參照模式，透過五個等級（即第一至五級，第五級再細分為5*及5**）區分頂尖表現的考生；

（五）據悉本港大學在收生時對應用學習科目的比重較低或不予考慮其文憑試的成績，令該科目被視為考生的次等選擇，甚至被認為是成績較差的考生才會選擇，當局有何方法增加該科目的認受性；

（六）據悉澳洲高中生在高中職專課程中獲得的學分，可直接轉入部分大學課程，以增加學生選擇修讀職專課程的誘因，隨着新應科大的成立，當局會否考慮促進大學與中學的合作，增強應用學習科目與大學課程的銜接；及

（七）當局在應科大聯盟於去年十一月成立後，有何新的政策措施進一步推動應科大課程與行業的深度結合？

答覆：

主席：

就梁文廣議員的提問，教育局回覆如下：

（一）至（三）應用學習是有價值的高中選修科目，屬香港中學文憑考試（文憑試）乙類科目，與高中甲類（學習領域科目）和丙類（其他語言課程）科目相輔相成，豐富學生的科目選擇。應用學習課程理論與實踐並重，與職業和專業領域連繫，有助學生加深認識職業專才教育，為未來升學及就業作好準備。

應用學習由最初30個課程發展至目前近60個課程（課程一覽表見教育局網頁www.edb.gov.hk/apl/courselist2028HKDSE），涵蓋六個學習範疇，包括：
（1）創意學習；
（2）媒體及傳意；
（3）商業、管理及法律；
（4）服務；
（5）應用科學；及
（6）工程及生產。

學生可因應自身興趣、志向和能力，選修合適的課程。由於學生的學習興趣、志向和能力各有不同，不同應用學習課程的修讀人數出現差異實屬正常。

課程規劃方面，教育局秉持專業原則，綜合考慮學生需要、社會發展、資源等因素，而非僅以修讀人數作為規劃依據。教育局開辦多元化的課程，以照顧學生的不同能力、興趣和職業志向。為保證課程質素，教育局設有由課程發展議會應用學習委員會、香港學術及職業資歷評審局和香港考試及評核局（考評局）共同參與的質素保證機制，務求課程設計、教學實施及學習成果均符合既定標準。

教育局持續收集不同數據及持份者意見，以檢視應用學習課程推行成效。文憑試應用學習科目報考人數在過去五年持續上升，由二○二一年3430人大幅增加至二○二五年7891人，整體考生百分比由二○二一年佔6.6%上升至二○二五年佔14.1%（詳見附錄）。約九成考生獲得「達標」或以上成績，而考獲「達標並表現優異」（包括「達標並表現優異（I）」及「達標並表現優異（II）」）的考生百分比介乎26%至32%。此外，學校、學生、家長及課程提供機構等持份者均對應用學習表示非常滿意，認同應用學習對學生的個人成長、共通能力、行業知識和未來發展等均具正面影響。數據顯示，超過九成應用學習畢業生繼續升學，銜接不同課程，約5%投身全職或兼職工作。整體而言，應用學習的修讀人數呈上升趨勢，考生表現平穩，有助探索未來。

教育局會持續檢視及更新應用學習課程，透過與業界和學界緊密溝通，收集持份者意見，定期與課程提供機構交流，從而發展多元化且與時並進的應用學習課程，如在本年度開設與生成式人工智能、低空經濟相關的新課程，豐富學生的科目選擇。

（四）應用學習科目的課時為180小時，學習內容着重實用的學習元素，理論與實踐並重，與職業和專業領域連繫，不設公開考試，評核工作由個別課程提供機構負責。應用學習與甲類科目的課時、學習內容和評估方式不同，兩者不宜直接比較。至於應用學習的評級，教育局現正向持份者收集意見，並與考評局展開討論，探討優化應用學習成績匯報的可行性。

（五）至（七）大學收生一直按院校自主原則進行。個別院校、學系或課程將應用學習科目視為選修科目、給予額外分數或作為額外的輔助資料。以應用科學大學的應用學位課程為例，大部分課程將應用學習科目視為選修科目。教育局會繼續與專上院校溝通，推廣應用學習，以增加院校對應用學習的了解。教育局亦透過不同宣傳方式及渠道，包括舉辦課程展覽、播放電視宣傳短片和應用學習畢業生成功故事短片及舉辦家長講座等（有關資訊亦已上載教育局網頁www.edb.gov.hk/apl/ref-and-resources），加深持份者及公眾對應用學習的認識，藉以提高應用學習的認受性。

事實上，政府一直採用「職學聯通、多元發展」的策略，致力推廣職業專才教育（職專教育），並鼓勵年輕人按自己的能力和興趣選擇升學出路及加入不同行業。當中，為強化職專進階路徑，提升職專教育在學位程度的地位，政府於二○二四年二月公布成為應用科學大學的條件。其後，政府分別在二○二四年三月及十一月公布香港都會大學及聖方濟各大學，分別通過嚴謹程序及評審，成功成爲香港首兩所應用科學大學。政府會繼續推動應用科學大學發展，支持更多有能力並具決心朝應用科學大學方向發展的專上院校作出規劃，並通過在二○二四年十一月正式成立的應用科學大學聯盟，推動專上院校與業界及學界進行聯動推廣，以為不同背景的學生提供多元出路。

此外，職業訓練局（職訓局）在教育局支持下，在二○二三／二四學年起於中學推出創新概念的職專教育文憑（高中課程）先導計劃，讓高中學生在文憑試的框架下，同步修讀職專教育相關課程。先導計劃將職專元素融入文憑試的框架當中，課程內容包括職業英語和職業中文、加入延伸學習時數的相關文憑試甲類選修科、應用學習課程及其他學習經歷。學生在修畢課程後，可同時取得文憑試證書及資歷架構第三級的職專教育文憑，銜接職訓局的相關高級文憑課程，從而完善職專教育升學路徑。二○二五／二六學年的先導計劃涉及「酒店及旅遊」和「資訊科技」兩個學科範疇，共有六間中學約120名學生參與。教育局會繼續支持有關工作。"
LCQ22: Promoting Applied Learning subjects,2025-09-25 11:34,2025-09-25 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500467.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Leung Man-kwong and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 Applied Learning (ApL), as an elective in the senior secondary curriculum, emphasises practicality and focuses on learning elements linked to different vocational fields. It serves as a key component in the interface between local secondary education and vocational and professional education and training (VPET) as well as the promotion of VPET. There are views that, given the increasing emphasis placed on VPET by both our country and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, coupled with the establishment of the second university of applied sciences (UAS) in November last year, there will be better integration between ApL subjects in senior secondary education and UAS. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that, among the 7 891 candidates sitting for ApL subjects in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) 2025, the distribution of candidates across subjects was highly uneven, in which the most popular subject ""Pâtisserie and Café Operations"" attracted nearly 1 000 candidates, while more than half of the subjects recorded fewer than 100 candidates and nobody sat for the subject ""Computer Forensic Technology"", whether the authorities have assessed the reasons for the popularity or unpopularity of certain subjects among candidates;

(2) since the establishment of ApL subjects, how the authorities assess their effectiveness; apart from the number of candidates sitting for these subjects in the HKDSE, whether the authorities have formulated other performance indicators;

(3) whether the authorities will consider reviewing afresh the effectiveness of ApL subjects, such as whether the subjects can bring tangible benefits to students by enhancing their job-seeking skills, in order to further consolidate the subjects as well as the existing resources, and thereby improving the quality of the courses;

(4) as there are views that a relatively simple assessment approach is adopted for ApL subjects in the HKDSE than that of the Category A Senior Secondary subjects, whether the authorities have considered adopting the standard-referenced approach used for Category A Senior Secondary subjects in the assessment of ApL subjects and differentiating candidates with outstanding performance through five grades (i.e. level 1 to level 5, with level 5 further subdivided into 5* and 5**);

(5) as it is learnt that local universities attach relatively little importance to ApL subjects in consideration of student admission or simply disregard the results of such subjects in the HKDSE, ApL subjects are considered as an inferior option for candidates, or even be regarded as options for those with weaker academic performance, of the means through which the authorities enhance the recognition of the subjects;

(6) as it is learnt that credits earned by Australian high school students in VPET courses at upper secondary level can be directly transferred to certain university programmes, thereby increasing the incentives for students to pursue VPET education, following the establishment of the new UAS, whether the authorities will consider promoting collaboration between universities and secondary schools to strengthen articulation between ApL subjects and university programmes; and

(7) following the establishment of the UAS Alliance in November last year, of new policy initiatives put in place by the authorities to further promote the deep integration of UAS programmes with the industries concerned?

Reply:

President,

 The reply to the questions raised by the Hon Leung Man-kwong is as follows:

(1) to (3) Applied Learning (ApL) is a valued senior secondary elective subject under Category B of the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE). It complements senior secondary subjects under Category A (subjects under the Key Learning Areas) and Category C (Other Languages courses), enriching students' subject choices. ApL, putting dual emphasis on theory and practice, is linked to vocational and professional fields. It helps students enhance their understanding of vocational and professional education and training (VPET), and prepares them for further studies and career pursuits in the future.

 ApL has expanded from 30 courses at its inception to nearly 60 courses at present (please refer to the Education Bureau (EDB) website at www.edb.gov.hk/apl/courselist2028HKDSE for the list of courses). It covers six Areas of Studies, namely:
(1) Creative Studies;
(2) Media and Communication;
(3) Business, Management and Law;
(4) Services;
(5) Applied Science; and
(6) Engineering and Production.

 Students may choose to take suitable courses based on their interests, aspirations and abilities. As students' learning interests, aspirations and abilities vary, it is normal for variance in enrolment figures across different ApL courses.

 In curriculum planning, the EDB uphold professional principles and holistically consider factors such as student needs, social development and resources, rather than relying solely on the enrolment figures as the basis for planning. A variety of courses are offered to cater for students with diverse abilities, interests and career aspirations. To assure course quality, the EDB has established a quality assurance mechanism involving the Curriculum Development Council Committee on ApL, the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications, and the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA). This ensures that the course design, implementation and learning outcomes meet the set standards.

 The EDB continuously collects data and feedback from stakeholders to review the effectiveness of the implementation of ApL courses. The number of candidates entering for the HKDSE ApL subjects has continued to increase over the past five years, showing a notable increase from 3 430 in 2021 to 7 891 in 2025. The percentage of candidates taking ApL subjects has risen from 6.6 per cent in 2021 to 14.1 per cent in 2025 (see Annex for details). Approximately 90 per cent of the candidates achieved ""Attained"" or above, and the percentage of candidates achieving ""Attained with Distinction"" (including ""Attained with Distinction (I)"" and ""Attained with Distinction (II)"") ranged from 26 per cent to 32 per cent. In addition, stakeholders including schools, students, parents and course providers express high satisfaction with ApL and agree on ApL's positive impact on students' personal growth, generic skills, industry knowledge, and future development. Data shows that over 90 per cent of ApL graduates have pursued further studies, articulating to different programmes, while about 5 per cent have taken up full-time or part-time employment. Overall, the enrolment of ApL shows an upward trend; candidate performance remains stable; and the courses help students explore future pathways.

 The EDB will continue to review and renew ApL courses, gauge stakeholders' views by engaging the industry and the education sectors in close communication, and maintain regular exchanges with course providers, so as to develop diversified and up-to-date ApL courses, such as the new courses related to generative artificial intelligence and low-altitude economy introduced this year, to enrich students' subject choices.

(4) The duration of each ApL subject is 180 contact hours. The learning content focuses on practical learning elements with dual emphasis on theory and practice linked to vocational and professional fields. There is no public examination, and the assessment is administered by the respective course providers. ApL and Category A subjects differ in terms of course duration, learning content and assessment, hence making direct comparisons between the two is not appropriate. As for the grading of ApL, the EDB are collecting views from stakeholders and in discussion with the HKEAA to explore the feasibility of optimising the results reporting of ApL.

(5) to (7) University admission has been following the principle of institutional autonomy. Individual institutions, faculties or programmes may consider ApL subjects as electives, or subjects for award of extra bonus or additional information. Taking the applied degree programmes of universities of applied sciences (UAS) as an example, ApL subjects are considered as elective subjects for most of these programmes. The EDB will continue to communicate with post-secondary institutions to promote ApL and deepen their understanding of ApL. The EDB also publicise through different means and channels, including organising course exhibitions, broadcasting television announcements of public interest and videos on ApL graduates' success stories as well as arranging parent seminars (relevant information has been uploaded onto the EDB website at www.edb.gov.hk/en/apl/ref-and-resources), to deepen the understanding of ApL among stakeholders and the public, thereby enhancing the recognition of ApL.

 In fact, the Government has been promoting VPET through the strategy of fostering industry-institution collaboration and diversified development, encouraging young people to choose their articulation pathways and join different industries based on their abilities and interests. Specifically, in order to strengthen the VPET articulation pathway and enhance the status of VPET at degree level, the Government promulgated the criteria for qualifying as UAS in February 2024. Subsequently, the Government announced that the Hong Kong Metropolitan University and Saint Francis University had undergone stringent procedures and reviews and qualified as the first two UAS in Hong Kong in March and November 2024 respectively. The Government will continue to promote the development of UAS and support more post-secondary institutions that are capable and aspire to become UAS to develop along that direction and make relevant planning. Through the Alliance of UAS established in November 2024, the Government will also encourage post-secondary institutions to carry out joint promotion with the industries and the school sector to provide diversified pathways for students of different backgrounds.

 In addition, with the support from the EDB, the Vocational Training Council (VTC) has launched in secondary schools an innovative pilot project, the Diploma of Vocational Education (Senior Secondary Curriculum) (DVE(SSC)), starting from the 2023/24 academic year, to allow senior secondary school students to pursue VPET-related programmes embedded in the HKDSE curriculum. The pilot project integrates VPET elements into the HKDSE framework, covering Vocational English and Vocational Chinese, relevant Category A elective subjects of the HKDSE with additional lesson hours of extended learning, ApL courses and Other Learning Experiences. Upon completion of the programme, students will be awarded, alongside their HKDSE qualification, a DVE(SSC) at Qualifications Framework Level 3 and may articulate to relevant Higher Diploma programmes of VTC, thereby enhancing the VPET articulation pathway. In the 2025/26 academic year, the pilot project covers two subject areas, namely "" Hospitality"" and ""Information Technology"", with around 120 participating students from six secondary schools. The EDB will continue to support the relevant work."
立法會三題：監管「預製菜」食品,2025-09-25 11:33,2025-09-25 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500517.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上黃俊碩議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的答覆︰

問題：

據悉近年不少食肆為了提升效率及降低營運成本，向外採購或自行生產「預製菜」以供顧客享用。然而，現時香港並無專門監管製作、運輸和銷售預製菜，以及保障消費者相關權益的法例。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年政府接獲多少宗涉及食肆出現食物安全問題的個案，以及當中涉及預製菜食品的數目為何；

（二）鑑於國家市場監管總局等六個部門於去年聯合發布《關於加強預製菜食品安全監管促進產業高質量發展通知》，首次明確預製菜定義及範圍，強化預製菜食品安全監管，當局會否參考有關做法以加強監管預製菜食品；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有消費者認為，他們有權利在光顧食肆前知悉食肆所提供的食物是否屬預製菜，當局會否考慮規定食肆須標明屬於預製菜的食物；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

「預製菜」是一個比較新的詞語，在國際間還沒有劃一的定義，不同業界人士與消費者對何謂「預製菜」都可能有不同理解和期望。一般來說，「預製菜」泛指經加工和配製後成為製成品或半製成品的食物，包括只需翻熱即可食用的菜式。

從食物安全角度看，不論是否「預製菜」，所有在香港出售的食物都受到嚴格規管，必須符合食物安全法例的要求。本港的食物生產工場必須持有食物環境衞生署（食環署）根據《食物業規例》發出的食物製造廠牌照。若食物並非在香港生產，《食物安全條例》亦規定食物進口商和分銷商必須備存食物紀錄，確保當局能快速有效追蹤食物來源和採取相應跟進行動。

一些風險較高的進口食物會受特定法例規管，必須附有由來源地有關當局發出的衞生證明書及食環署發出的進口准許。食肆供應食物均必須符合相關法例和發牌要求。如有任何涉及食物安全的投訴或事故，食環署會按《公眾衞生及市政條例》作出調查及提出檢控。

換言之，不同種類的食品，包括一般概念的「預製菜」，從生產、進口到售賣的各個環節，均受到現行食物安全法例的監管。而為了協助業界明白有關要求，食環署出版了《食物衞生守則》，說明食物業處所根據法例和牌照條件須遵守的各項食物衞生及安全標準。該《守則》涵蓋不同種類食物的製作、處理、運送、貯存及銷售等各個範疇，並就如何符合標準提供建議和指引。

就黃議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）由二○二三年至今年八月，食環署對持牌／持證食物業處所進行了超過446 000次巡查，並就各類涉及食物安全的違規情況提出共4 215宗檢控。由於食物業處所需要符合的食物安全和環境衞生條件不會因為它是否售賣「預製菜」而有所分別，所以署方並無備存涉及「預製菜」的檢控分項數字。

此外，食物安全中心（食安中心）一直按風險為本的原則在進口、批發及零售層面抽檢食物樣本。同期，食安中心共抽取逾1 350個預製食品樣本作化學、微生物及輻射檢測，當中除一個樣本的微生物檢測結果不合格外，其餘均測試合格，合格率與食物監測計劃的整體數字相若。

（二）內地相關當局去年三月發布《關於加強預製菜食品安全監管促進產業高質量發展的通知》，提出研究制定「預製菜」食品安全標準，以及多項有關加強「預製菜」食品安全監管和促進「預製菜」產業高質量發展的工作。特區政府食安中心也於今年六月發布了《預製菜—給食物業及消費者的食物安全建議》，協助業界採取適當措施，製作和供應安全衞生的「預製菜」，例如提醒食物業應徹底烹煮及翻熱「預製菜」，並在運輸及貯存過程中保持良好的冷鏈系統，避免「預製菜」暴露於「危險溫度範圍」（即攝氏4度至60度）等。

（三）內地當局的《通知》提出大力推廣餐飲環節使用「預製菜」明示，不過這方面的建議並非強制性，而是鼓勵性質，不具約束力。從食物安全的角度來說，食肆出售的食物是否安全，與是否採用預製食材沒有關係，強制食肆為此作出標示並不會進一步改善食物安全。

至於有消費者希望在光顧食肆前知悉食肆所提供的食物是否屬「預製菜」，如前述，社會上不同人對甚麼是「預製菜」會有不同理解和期望。例如是否任何包含預製食材製作的菜式都是「預製菜」？如果一道菜式只有部分材料是預製，而其他部分都是現場即製，又是否將其歸類為「預製菜」？如果要求食肆把每道菜式的預製成分都要分列出來，又是否合理和現實上可行？這些都是我們需要考慮的因素。

事實上，食材的種類眾多，烹調方法也五花八門，並不容易為「預製菜」訂出準確清晰的定義。假如硬性規定食肆須標明屬於「預製菜」的食物，不但會難以執行，也容易引發食肆和消費者之間的爭拗。

主席，隨着加工和包裝技術進步，預製食品和食材在保鮮、殺菌、品質和口感各方面都在不斷改良。我們支持食物業界求變創新，配合市場需要，持續優化食物供應鏈。

正如我剛才所說，「預製菜」是比較新的概念，內地亦正就制定「預製菜」食品安全國家標準作出研究。有報道指國家衞健委（國家衞生健康委員會）即將就其主導的《預製菜食品安全國家標準》草案向社會公開徵求意見。我們會密切留意內地及本地有關「預製菜」的發展情況，有需要時會採取相應措施，保障市民健康及推動業界高質量發展。

多謝主席。"
"LCQ3: Regulating ""premade dishes""",2025-09-25 11:33,2025-09-25 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500522.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Edmund Wong and a reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  It is learnt that in recent years, many restaurants have purchased ""premade dishes"" from external sources or produced them in-house to enhance efficiency and reduce operating costs. However, Hong Kong currently has no dedicated legislation governing the production, transportation and sale of premade dishes, and protecting the relevant consumer rights. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of cases involving food safety problems in restaurants received by the Government in each of the past three years and, among them, the number of those involving premade dishes;

(2) as the State Administration for Market Regulation and five other ministries jointly issued the Notice of Strengthening the Regulation of the Food Safety of Premade Dishes and Promoting the High-Quality Development of the Industry last year, which for the first time clearly defines premade dishes and their scope and enhances the regulation of the food safety of premade dishes, whether the authorities will make reference to such practices in order to strengthen the regulation of premade dishes; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as some consumers are of the view that they have the right to know whether the food provided by restaurants is a premade dish before patronizing them, whether the authorities will consider requiring restaurants to label food that is a premade dish; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  ""Prepared dishes"" is a relatively new term which has yet to have a standardised international definition. Interpretations of what constitutes ""prepared dishes"" can vary among different members of the trade and consumers. Generally, ""prepared dishes"" refer to finished or semi-finished foods upon processing and cooking, including dishes that only require reheating before consumption.

  From the perspective of food safety, all food items sold in Hong Kong, regardless of whether they are ""prepared dishes"" or not, are subject to stringent regulation and they must comply with the requirements as set out in food safety legislation. Local food factories must obtain a food factory licence from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) under the Food Business Regulation. For foods not produced locally, the Food Safety Ordinance stipulates that food importers and distributors shall keep food records to ensure that the Government can trace the source of food items quickly and effectively for appropriate follow-up actions.

  Certain high-risk imported foods are subject to specific legislation and must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the competent authority of the place of origin and an import permission issued by the FEHD. Restaurants must comply with all relevant legislation and licencing requirements when serving food. In the event of food safety complaints or incidents, the FEHD will conduct investigations and institute prosecutions under the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance.

  In other words, different types of food, including ""prepared dishes"", are regulated by existing food safety legislation at all stages from production and import to sale. To assist the trade in understanding the pertinent requirements, the FEHD published the Food Hygiene Code, which spells out the food hygiene and safety standards that food premises must follow based on statutory and licencing conditions. The Code covers various aspects of production, handling, delivery, storage, and sale of different types of food, and offers recommendations and guidelines for meeting these standards.

  Regarding the questions raised by the Hon Wong, my reply is as follows:

(1) From 2023 until August of this year, the FEHD performed over 446000 inspections at licensed/permitted food premises and instituted a total of 4 215 prosecutions involving various food safety irregularities. As food premises serving or not serving ""prepared dishes"" shall meet the same food safety and environmental hygiene conditions, the FEHD does not keep separate prosecution figures specifically related to ""prepared dishes"".

  Besides, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) collects food samples for testing at import, wholesale and retail levels under a risk-based principle on an ongoing basis. During the same period, the CFS tested about 1 350 prepackaged food samples for chemical, microbiological, and radiation levels. Except for one sample with unsatisfactory result in the microbiological test, the results of all other samples were satisfactory. The satisfactory rate is comparable with the overall rate for CFS's Food Surveillance Programme.

(2) The Mainland authorities issued the Notice of Strengthening the Regulation of the Food Safety of Premade Dishes and Promoting the High-Quality Development of the Industry in March last year. The Notice proposed the formulation of food safety standards for ""prepared dishes"", along with various measures to strengthen the regulation of the food safety of ""prepared dishes"" and promote the high-quality development of the ""prepared dishes"" industry. In June this year, the CFS also released Prepared Dishes - Food Safety Advice for Food Businesses and Consumers to assist the trade in taking appropriate measures for producing and supplying safe and hygienic ""prepared dishes"". For instance, the food trade is reminded to cook and reheat ""prepared dishes"" thoroughly, and make sure that the cold chain is well maintained during transportation and storage to prevent ""prepared dishes"" from being exposed to the ""Temperature Danger Zone"" (i.e. between 4°C and 60°C), etc.

(3) The Notice issued by the Mainland authorities calls for stepping up the promotion of explicit labelling of ""prepared dishes"" in the catering sector, yet such a recommendation is an encouragement by nature. It is not mandatory with any binding effect. From the perspective of food safety, the safety of food served in restaurants does not depend on whether or not prepared ingredients are used. Imposing a mandatory labelling requirement on restaurants will not lead to further improvement in food safety.

  As for consumers who wish to know whether a restaurant serves ""prepared dishes"" before visiting, as mentioned earlier, the understanding and expectations of individuals regarding what constitutes ""prepared dishes"" differ. For instance, should any dish containing prepared ingredients be regarded as a ""prepared dish""? In some cases where only certain ingredients are prepared while the rest are made freshly on-site, should the dish still be classified as a ""prepared dish""? Is it reasonable and practical to require restaurants to list the prepared ingredients of each dish separately? These are factors that we have to take into account.

  In reality, given the wide variety of ingredients and cooking methods, it is challenging to establish a precise and clear definition of ""prepared dishes"". If a mandatory labelling requirement for ""prepared dishes"" is imposed on ""prepared dishes"", not only would it present enforcement challenges, but also potentially give rise to disagreements between restaurants and consumers.

  President, with advancements in processing and packaging technologies, prepared foods and ingredients have continued to become better in various aspects of preservation, sterilisation, quality and taste. We support the food trade's endeavours to innovate and change to meet market demands as well as to keep optimising the food supply chain.

  As I mentioned earlier, the term ""prepared dishes"" is relatively recent, and the Mainland is researching the establishment of national standards for the food safety of these dishes. There are also media reports on an upcoming plan by the National Health Commission to solicit public views on its draft legislation on National Standards for the Food Safety of Premade Dishes. We will closely monitor the development of ""prepared dishes"" both on the Mainland and locally, as well as implement suitable measures to safeguard public health and promote high-quality development of the food trade.

  Thank you, President."

答覆：

主席：

政府一直非常關注道路安全，以及車輛在行車時未有適當盛載或固定負載物而產生的道路安全問題。就陳健波議員的提問，經諮詢香港警務處（警務處）、路政署及運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）根據《道路交通（交通管制）規例》（第374G章），司機須確保負載物適當地固定或盛載在車輛上，而負載物的重量和其擺放的方法，均不可對任何人士造成危險。司機違反有關規例，如屬首次定罪，最高可處罰款五千元及監禁三個月。如屬第二次被定罪或隨後再次被定罪，最高可處罰款一萬元及監禁六個月。警務處負責就有關違規事項執法。

此外，運輸署亦根據上述規例，以及《行車隧道（政府）規例》（第368A章）、《青馬管制區（一般）規例》（第498B章）及《青沙管制區（一般）規例》（第594A章），於政府隧道、青馬管制區及青沙管制區範圍內就未有穩妥固定負載物的車輛執法。這三項附屬法例的規定和罰則，與上述第374G章所訂的大致相若。

在二○二二、二○二三及二○二四年，涉及有關載貨不穩的檢控數字分別為844宗、705宗及588宗。

（二）現時，路政署委聘承辦商每日巡查及清掃轄下快速道路（包括問題所指的吐露港公路、元朗公路和順朗路（即屯門至赤鱲角連接路南段）等），以減低路面障礙物對道路使用者造成的風險。

承辦商採用專用道路清掃車，以吸力或滾刷設備收集塵土、沙石及其他碎屑。若遇上障礙物或建築物料散落路面的情況，承辦商會即時調派額外人手和設備，以加快清理進度。路政署除定期審視承辦商的工作紀錄外，主管人員亦會不時到現場巡查，抽查清掃效果，包括路面清潔程度、沙石殘留情況及交通安全安排。路政署為清理快速道路上的障礙物訂立服務承諾，確保承辦商能迅速處理有關情況；根據紀錄，過去三年的個案全部達標。上述的處理機制，包括每日恆常巡查和清掃，以及因應實際情況即時作出清理安排，已能有效地清掃路面及清理障礙物。路政署會繼續密切監察承辦商的服務表現，提升路面清潔程度。

此外，運輸署委聘營辦商負責政府隧道的管理、營運及維修工作。在隧道範圍內的道路，例如屯門──赤鱲角隧道（即屯門至赤鱲角連接路北段），營辦商除定期清理行車道上的障礙物並以機動掃街車清掃路面外，亦會在例行巡邏期間或接獲報告時，即時處理路面障礙物或積聚沙石。營辦商近年已增加清理路面的次數。運輸署會繼續密切監察承辦商的服務表現，以保障道路安全。

（三）政府相關部門一直非常關注汽車負載物不穩固及超載，交換資訊並合作提升處理有關問題。警務處特別留意各類型貨車的違規情況，通過宣傳、教育及執法改變駕駛者的不負責任行為，保障道路使用者安全。警務處亦持續監察嚴重及致命交通意外的數據，並因應事故成因及趨勢，展開全港性專題執法行動，包括於今年九月進行的「打擊貨車違例行為」行動，以提升整體道路安全水平。

運輸署亦一直透過不同渠道進行宣傳和教育，加強貨車業界對載貨安全的認識。例如，根據《道路交通條例》（第374章）制訂《車輛載貨守則》，就載貨安全的不同範疇提供指引，包括選用適當車輛運載貨物、車上貨物擺放的正確方法等；出版《貨車運輸通訊》和與貨車業界舉行定期會議；在交通燈控制器上張貼宣傳畫貼，宣傳有關道路安全信息，提醒司機必須採取適當措施運載貨物；以及由隧道營辦商透過隧道區內可變信息顯示屏提醒司機採取適當措施，確保貨物穩妥繫牢等。

運輸署及警務處亦持續合作積極探索應用新科技，提升執法效率及加強道路安全。最近，警務處首次在非市區路段試驗使用無人機作交通錄影執法，打擊危險駕駛行為。警務處將會檢討成效，考慮擴展至其他地區或違例項目的可行性，例如負載物不穩固及超載等。

運輸署及警務處會繼續協力，聯同道路安全議會進行不同的宣傳及教育，例如出版和派發《道路安全通訊》及透過社交媒體平台發放資訊等，加強道路使用者的安全意識，提升載貨安全。"
LCQ21: Regulating use of vehicles for carriage of loads,2025-09-25 11:25,2025-09-25 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092300502.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Kin-por and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

Under the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations (Cap. 374G), a driver shall ensure that any load is properly secured to or contained on the vehicle and that its weight and the manner in which it is placed shall not cause danger to any person. However, it has been reported that construction materials or rubble carried by goods vehicles fall onto the ground from time to time, causing accidents where the windshields of moving vehicles are hit by the rubble stirred up, endangering the safety of road users. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of enforcement actions taken by the Government under Cap. 374G against breaches of the provisions governing use of vehicles for carriage of loads, and the number of prosecutions instituted, in each of the past three years;

(2) as some members of the insurance industry have relayed that there are a relatively large number of windshield damage claims involving vehicles passing through the Tuen Mun - Chek Lap Kok Link, Tolo Highway, and Yuen Long Highway, whether the authorities will consider requiring contractors to increase the frequency of cleaning on these three roads to ensure that rubble or obstacles on the ground are cleared expeditiously, thereby reducing the chances of vehicle damage; and

(3) whether it will arrange for relevant government departments, such as the Hong Kong Police Force, Highways Department, and Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, to carry out joint operations to step up efforts in combating illegal acts such as falling and scattering of objects from vehicles on the ground, as well as overloading of loads; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government all along attaches great importance to road safety and the road safety issues caused by moving vehicles with loads which are not properly contained or secured. Having consulted the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Highways Department (HyD) and the Transport Department (TD), my response to the question raised by the Hon Chan Kin-por is as follows:

(1) Under the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations (Cap. 374G), the driver shall ensure that any load is properly secured to or contained inside the vehicle and that its weight and manner in which it is placed in the vehicle shall not cause danger to any person. Any driver who contravenes the relevant regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for three months on first conviction; and to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months on second or subsequent convictions. The HKPF is responsible for law enforcement on related contraventions.

Moreover, according to the aforementioned regulations, as well as the Road Tunnels (Government) Regulations (Cap. 368A), the Tsing Ma Control Area (General) Regulation (Cap. 498B) and the Tsing Sha Control Area (General) Regulation (Cap. 594A), the TD takes enforcement actions against vehicles failing to properly secure their loads in the area of government tunnels, the Tsing Ma Control Area and the Tsing Sha Control Area. The requirements and penalties under these three pieces of subsidiary legislation are on par with those stipulated in the aforementioned Cap. 374G.

In 2022, 2023 and 2024, the number of prosecutions for insecure loading was 844, 705 and 588 respectively.

(2) Currently, the HyD engages contractors to carry out inspections and conduct road cleaning on expressways (including the Tolo Highway, Yuen Long Highway and Shun Long Road (i.e. the southern section of the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link) referred to in the question) on a daily basis to minimise the risks posed by obstacles on road surface to road users.

The contractors use specialised road sweepers equipped with suction or roller brushes to collect dust, gravel and other debris. In case obstacles or construction materials are found scattered on the road surface, the contractors will immediately deploy additional manpower and equipment to expedite the clearance process. In addition to regular review of contractors' work records, the HyD supervisory staff conduct frequent on-site inspections to assess cleaning effectiveness, including road surface cleanliness, residual sand and gravel, and road safety arrangements. The HyD also establishes performance pledges for clearing obstacles on expressways to ensure prompt contractor response. Records indicate that all cases over the past three years have met this standard. The aforementioned mechanism, consisting of daily routine inspections and cleaning, and immediate clearance arrangements in response to actual situations, is effective in cleaning road surfaces and removing obstacles. The HyD will continue to closely monitor contractors' performance to enhance road surface cleanliness.

Moreover, the TD engages operators to manage, operate, and maintain government tunnels. For road sections within tunnel areas, such as the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Tunnel (i.e. the northern section of the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link), the operator removes obstacles from carriageways and sweeps road surfaces with mechanical street sweepers regularly, and also clears road obstacles or accumulated gravel during routine patrols or upon receiving reports. The operator has increased the frequency of road surface cleaning in the recent years. The TD will continue to closely monitor the contractor's performance to ensure road safety.

(3) The relevant government departments have expressed significant concern over insecure vehicle loads and overloading, and are actively collaborating and sharing information to improve the management of these issues. The HKPF has been paying particular attention to such violations, especially those involving various types of goods vehicles, and seeks to change irresponsible driving behaviour through publicity, education and enforcement, with a view to safeguarding the safety of road users. The HKPF also continuously monitors data on serious and fatal traffic accidents and conducts territory-wide enforcement operations in response to accident causes and emerging trends. These include the ""Crackdown on Lorry Offences"" operation conducted in September this year, with the aim of enhancing overall road safety.

The TD has been conducting publicity and educational activities through various channels to enhance the goods vehicle trade's awareness of safe loading. For example, a Code of Practice for the Loading of Vehicles is compiled in accordance with the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374), which provides guidelines covering various areas of safe loading, including the use of suitable vehicles for carrying loads, proper methods of placing loads inside vehicles, etc. The TD also issues the Goods Vehicle Trade Newsletter and holds regular meetings with the goods vehicle trade. Posters are affixed on traffic signal controllers to promote road safety and remind drivers to adopt appropriate measures to secure loads. The tunnel operators display messages on variable message signs to remind drivers to secure the loads properly.

The TD and the HKPF will continue to collaborate proactively in exploring the application of new technologies to enhance enforcement efficiency and strengthen road safety. Recently, the HKPF conducted the first trial of drone-assisted traffic enforcement on non-urban road sections to combat dangerous driving. The HKPF will review the effectiveness of the trial and consider the feasibility of extending the initiative to other areas or offence types, including insecure vehicle loads and overloading.

The TD and the HKPF will continue to work with the Road Safety Council to conduct various publicity and educational programmes, such as publishing and distributing the Road Safety Bulletin, and disseminating information through social media platforms, to enhance road users' awareness of safety and safe loading."
立法會五題：保障惡劣天氣下僱員的安全和權益,2025-09-25 11:24,2025-09-25 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500512.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上郭偉强議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，現時勞工處制訂的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》（《守則》）欠缺法律效力，對「指定人員」的定義模糊，不利於保障僱員安全和權益。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，勞工處接獲僱員因惡劣天氣或「極端情況」，以致未能或及時返回工作崗位而被解僱、扣減工資、勤工獎、津貼、年假、法定假日或休息日，又或被要求以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工時的求助及投訴個案數目為何；

（二）會否就《守則》下的指定人員訂定清晰定義，要求僱主在招聘「指定人員」時清晰告知其工作安排，以及在惡劣天氣及「極端情況」出現時對工作環境作風險評估，並為仍須上班的指定人員提供膳食和交通津貼；及

（三）會否立法訂明惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下的停工安排，規定非緊急服務工種無須上班，並要求僱主不得對因該等情況缺勤或遲到的僱員扣薪或扣假；如會，立法詳情及時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

一直以來，勞工處呼籲僱主應因應行業的實際運作需要、僱員工作及往返工作地點的安全等因素，預先和僱員制定在惡劣天氣下的工作安排和應變措施。勞工處發布的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》（《守則》），已就熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及「極端情況」發出時的工作安排，包括僱員上班、提早下班、復工及遙距工作等，為僱主和僱員提供實務指引和參考示例。

《守則》提醒僱主制定有關工作安排和應變措施時，須參照以下的基本原則，包括要充分諮詢及考慮員工的意見、必須履行勞工法例下的責任及規定、以僱員的安全為首要考慮、將在工作地點當值的人數減至最少，以及體諒僱員的實際困難和需要，以情理兼備及彈性的方式處理僱員的出勤情況。

就議員提問的綜合回答如下：

在上班安排方面，僱主須按剛才所述的基本原則，訂定在惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下需要返回工作地點當值的員工，即「指定人員」。《守則》已提醒僱主須就「指定人員」的安全、交通及膳食等預早作好安排。

由於各行業職位的工作性質和營運模式，以至機構的人手調配各有不同，僱員是否需要返回工作地點或以其他方式候命及當值，須視乎實際情況。不少緊急以及與民生需要密切相關的服務，在惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下仍需維持運作及作出靈活調動，「一刀切」列明需要返回工作地點當值的工種和「指定人員」類別，實際操作上並不可行。

不同行業及工種亦有其相聯性或供應鏈的關係，環環緊扣，不能單純以個別行業及工種的一般性質決定是否屬於緊急服務。例如為醫院或院舍提供膳食的機構，假如其僱員停工，對醫院或院舍的運作可能帶來嚴重影響。另外，惡劣天氣或「極端情況」對僱員往返其工作和居住地區的影響程度各有不同。以立法方式規定在惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下的停工安排，對維持社會有效運作及盡早復常帶來負面影響，並削弱勞資雙方在工作安排上的靈活性，因此並不合適。

如僱員需要在惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下工作，根據《僱員補償條例》，在指明的惡劣天氣或「極端情況」生效期間，如僱員在其該日工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由居所前往工作地點途中，或在下班後由工作地點返回居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。另外，僱主須預先評估潛在的風險，並採取措施包括提供和維持安全的工作系統，把工作危險減至最低。如違反規定，最高可處罰款一千萬元及監禁兩年。

《僱傭條例》亦已有清晰條文保障僱員的權益。其中，僱主不可用僱員在該條例下的年假、法定假日或休息日，抵銷因惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下僱員未能上班工作的時間。僱主如無合理辯解而不遵守條例的相關規定，即屬違法。如僱員由於惡劣天氣或不受控制的環境因素影響而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位復工，僱主應體諒員工，不應因此扣薪。

勞工處目前雖沒有備存關於僱員因惡劣天氣或「極端情況」而引起的求助及投訴數字，僱傭雙方如有爭議，或僱員因惡劣天氣或「極端情況」遭遇不合理對待或合法權益受損，可向勞工處求助及申訴，勞工處勞資關係科會提供適切協助，致力調停或跟進調查。

多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Safeguarding employees' safety and interests in times of adverse weather,2025-09-25 11:24,2025-09-25 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500526.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kwok Wai-keung and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  There are views that the existing ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" (the Code) formulated by the Labour Department (LD) lacks a legally binding effect and contains an ambiguous definition of ""designated staff"", which is not conducive to safeguarding employees' safety and interests. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of requests for assistance and complaints received by the LD over the past three years from employees who were dismissed, had their wages, good attendance bonus, allowances, annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days deducted owing to their inability to resume duty or inability to resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, or were asked for additional hours of work to compensate for the loss of working hours when they were unable to report for duty;

(2) whether it will provide a clear definition of designated staff under the Code, requiring employers to clearly inform these staff members of their work arrangements upon recruitment, conduct risk assessments on the working environment in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions, and provide meal and travel allowances to designated staff who are still required to report for duty; and

(3) whether it will legislate for work suspension arrangements in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions, stipulating that employees providing non-urgent services are not required to report for duty, and requiring employers not to deduct the salary or leave entitlements of employees who are absent from or late for work under such circumstances; if so, of the legislative details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Labour Department (LD) has all along called on employers to formulate work arrangements and contingency measures under adverse weather together with their employees in advance, having regard to factors such as the actual operational needs of their industries, the safety of their employees both at work and during commuting to and from the workplaces, etc. The ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" (CoP), published by the LD, has provided practical guidelines and reference examples for employers and employees on work arrangements when tropical cyclones, rainstorm warnings and ""extreme conditions"" are in force, including reporting for duty, early release from work, resumption of work and remote work.

  The CoP reminds employers that they shall make reference to the following basic principles when formulating relevant work arrangements and contingency measures. The basic principles include fully consulting and considering employees' views, fulfilling obligations and requirements under the labour legislation, giving prime consideration to the safety of employees, keeping the number of staff required to report for duty at workplaces to the minimum, as well as taking into account employees' practical difficulties and needs, so as to handle employees' attendance matters in a considerate, sympathetic and flexible manner.

  The consolidated reply to the Member's question is as follows:

  With respect to arrangements for reporting for duty, employers shall specify employees who are required to report for duty at workplaces in times of adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"", i.e. ""designated staff"", in accordance with the aforesaid basic principles. The CoP has reminded employers that they shall make proper arrangements in respect of safety, transportation and meals, etc. for ""designated staff"" in advance.

  Owing to the diverse work nature and modes of operation of job categories across various industries and hence the differences in organisations' manpower deployment, whether employees need to return to their workplaces or remain on standby and duty in other ways depends on the actual circumstances. Many emergency services and services closely related to the livelihood need to maintain operation and make flexible adjustments during adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"". It is operationally impracticable to adopt a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach in specifying which job categories and types of ""designated staff"" should return to their workplaces to report for duty.

  Moreover, different industries and job categories have interrelated or supply chain relationships that are closely linked. It is infeasible to determine whether a service is an emergency service solely based on the general nature of an individual industry or job category. For example, the operation of hospitals or residential care homes may be severely impacted if employees of organisations providing meals to them suspend work. In addition, the impact of adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"" on employees commuting between their workplaces and residence varies. Legislating for work suspension arrangements under adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"" would pose adverse impact on maintaining the effective functioning of the society and the early resumption of normalcy, and would undermine the flexibility in work arrangements for both employers and employees. It is hence inappropriate to take the legislative approach.

  If employees have to work in times of adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"", pursuant to the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths occurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplaces, or from their workplaces back to their residence after work, within a period of four hours before or after the working hours on a day when the specified adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"" is in force. Besides, employers shall assess the potential risks in advance and implement measures, including the provision and maintenance of safe systems of work, to reduce the risks to the minimum. Contravention of the provisions is liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

  The Employment Ordinance also stipulates clear provisions to safeguard the rights of employees. Among them, employers are not allowed to use employees' annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Ordinance to offset the time when employees are unable to work due to adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"". An employer who without reasonable excuse fails to comply with relevant provisions of the Ordinance is in breach of the law. If employees are unable to report for duty at workplaces or resume work on time due to adverse weather or environmental factors beyond their control, the employers should be considerate towards the employees and should not consequently deduct their wages.

  While the LD currently does not keep figures on requests for assistance or complaints from employees arising from adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"", if there are disputes between employers and employees, or if employees encounter unreasonable treatment or infringement of their legal rights arising from adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"", they can seek help and lodge complaints with the LD. The Labour Relations Division of the LD will provide appropriate assistance, endeavouring to conciliate or conduct follow-up investigation.

  Thank you, President."

問題：

政府早前公布，截至今年七月三十一日，首批約13 000名簽證到期的「高端人才通行證計劃」（高才通計劃）人才中，近半未有申請續簽。此外，勞工及福利局局長早前接受傳媒採訪時指出，高才通計劃人才若未能成功續簽，其子女受養人便須退學離港。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述未有申請續簽的高才通計劃人才的在港就學子女受養人數目，以及當中已辦理退學申請的數目為何；

（二）政府有否設立機制，讓相關政府部門在確定高才通計劃人才未有提交續簽申請或不獲續簽後，通報其他政府部門處理有關子女受養人的就學安排；及

（三）有否考慮讓未有申請續簽的高才通計劃人才的子女保留學位，以非本地生身分繼續在港就學？

答覆：

主席：

在「一國兩制」制度優勢下，香港進出自由，一直是人才匯聚、探索機遇、洽商及交流的國際城市，而香港多元和優質的教育亦是吸引人才來港的因素之一。透過不同的人才入境計劃（包括「高端人才通行證計劃」（高才通計劃））來港人士的子女若符合入境事務處（入境處）訂明的條件，可以受養人身分申請並獲發簽證來港居留。根據現行教育政策，適齡的受養人亦合資格入讀公營學校，接受免費的中小學教育，或入讀其他學校（包括直接資助計劃學校和國際學校）。

根據《入境條例》（第115章），凡獲准在香港入境或留在香港的人士，入境處可向他們施加逗留期限及其他逗留條件。他們在留港期間須遵守入境處向其施加的逗留條件，並須於逗留期限屆滿當日或之前離開香港。受養人在香港的逗留期限一般會與其保證人的逗留期限掛鈎，若保證人不再申請或不獲准延長逗留期限，受養人就不再符合居港資格，並必須與其保證人一同於逗留期限屆滿前離港。

就議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局、保安局及入境處後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）根據現行安排，獲准以受養人身分來港居住的人士（包括但不限於各項人才入境計劃的成功申請人的受養人），可以在香港就學而無須事先獲得入境處處長批准。他們可以選擇入讀不同資助模式的中小學，而學校亦無須向教育局申報。因此，現時政府沒有備存該等受養人在港就學及退學申請的個案數字。

（三）一般而言，除擁有香港特區居留權或入境權的人士外，任何人士如欲來港就讀，均須申領入境簽證／進入許可。對於未有在高才通計劃下申請續簽的人士，其適齡就讀中小學的子女在符合有關政策規定情況下（包括已獲得相關非公營學校取錄），可向入境處申請來港就讀的簽證／進入許可。目前，相關安排不適用於包括內地的中國公民。詳情可參考相關網站:www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/visas/study.html。"
Labour Department to use small unmanned aircraft to assist in law enforcement (with photos),2025-09-25 11:05,2025-09-25 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500483.htm,"  âThe Labour Department (LD) will start using small unmanned aircraft (SUA) from October to assist Occupational Safety Officers (OSOs) in conducting inspections and enforcement actions. A special inspection exercise using SUA will also be launched to combat unsafe work activities.

  The Commissioner for Labour, Mr Sam Hui, and the Deputy Commissioner (Occupational Safety and Health), Mr Vincent Fung, attended an SUA drill earlier to understand the operation of SUA by OSOs and its effectiveness in application.

  Mr Hui said, ""OSOs can utilise SUA to conduct aerial remote site surveillance in the future. Upon detecting unsafe work practices, OSOs will be able to take photos and videos immediately for evidence collection before deploying staff to enter the sites for law enforcement. In addition, SUA will also facilitate the inspection of remote or inaccessible workplaces, thereby significantly enhancing inspection efficiency.""

  The SUA adopted by the LD is equipped with superzoom and high-resolution cameras capable of shooting remote aerial photography and videography, assisting OSOs in collecting evidence during inspections and accident investigations.

  The LD will launch a special inspection exercise using SUA in October, focusing on construction sites with working-at-height activities to curb unsafe work practices. If any violation of the occupational safety and health (OSH) legislation is detected, the LD will take stringent enforcement actions immediately, including issuing suspension notices and improvement notices as well as initiating prosecutions without prior warning.

  The LD will continue to keep in view the application of technological products, including the latest technological developments of AI systems, and keep using technology to assist in law enforcement, with a view to enhancing the deterrent effect of the legislation and further safeguarding the OSH of workers."

Question:

 The Government has announced earlier on that as of July 31 this year, nearly half of the first batch of approximately 13 000 talent with expired visas under the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) have not applied for visa extension. In addition, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare has indicated previously in a media interview that for those TTPS talent who fail to obtain visa extension, their dependant children will be required to drop out of school and leave Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of dependant children of the aforesaid TTPS talent who have not applied for visa extension studying in Hong Kong and, among them, the number of those who have applied for withdrawal from school;

(2) whether the Government has established a mechanism whereby the relevant government departments, after confirming that TTPS talent have not submitted visa extension applications or have not been granted visa extension, may notify other government departments to handle the schooling arrangement for the dependant children concerned; and

(3) whether it has considered allowing the children of TTPS talent who have not applied for visa extension to retain their school places and continue their studies in Hong Kong as non-local students?

Reply:

President,

 With the institutional advantages of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is an international city where people enjoy freedom of movement and talent gather for exploration of opportunities, negotiations and exchanges. Hong Kong's diverse and quality education is also one of the factors attracting talent to Hong Kong. Children of those who come to Hong Kong under various talent admission schemes (including the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS)) may apply for and be issued with a visa for residence in Hong Kong as dependants, provided that they meet the criteria set by the Immigration Department (ImmD). Under the existing education policy, school-age dependants are also eligible to enrol in public sector schools to receive free primary and secondary education. They may also enrol in other schools, such as Direct Subsidy Scheme schools and international schools.

 Under the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115), where permission is given to a person to land or remain in Hong Kong, the ImmD may impose a limit of stay or other conditions of stay. Such persons must comply with the conditions of stay imposed by the ImmD during their stay in Hong Kong and are required to depart Hong Kong on or before the expiry date of their limit of stay. The limit of stay in Hong Kong of dependants is normally linked to that of their sponsors. In the case that a sponsor ceases to apply for an extension of stay or the application is rejected, the dependant will no longer be eligible for residence in Hong Kong and is required to depart Hong Kong together with the sponsor before the expiry of their limit of stay.

 In consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the Security Bureau and the ImmD, the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Member is as follows:

(1) and (2) Under the prevailing arrangement, persons who are permitted to reside in Hong Kong as dependants (including but not limited to dependants of successful applicants under various talent admission schemes) are not required to obtain prior permission from the Director of Immigration for studying in Hong Kong. They can choose to enrol in primary and secondary schools of different finance types, and the schools are not required to report to the Education Bureau. As such, the Government does not have the statistics on the number of such dependants studying in Hong Kong and the number of those who have applied for withdrawal from schools.

(3) In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), he/she requires a visa/entry permit to study here. For those who have not applied for extension of stay under the TTPS, their school-age children for primary and secondary education who meet the related policy requirements (including having been admitted by relevant non-public sector schools) may apply to the ImmD for a visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR for study. At present, such arrangement does not apply to, among others, Chinese nationals of the Mainland. For details, please refer to the relevant website: www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/study.html."
Adjustment in ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations in October 2025,2025-09-25 11:00,2025-09-25 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500506.htm," The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) today (September 25) announced an adjustment to the auto-LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations from October 1 to October 31, 2025, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts for dedicated LPG filling stations.

 A department spokesman said that the adjustment on October 1, 2025, would reflect the movement of the LPG international price in September 2025. The adjusted auto-LPG ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations would range from $3.21 to $4.13 per litre, amounting to a decrease of $0.01 per litre.

 The spokesman said that the auto-LPG ceiling prices were adjusted according to a pricing formula specified in the contracts. The formula comprises two elements - the LPG international price and the LPG operating price. The LPG international price refers to the LPG international price of the preceding month. The LPG operating price is adjusted on February 1 and June 1 annually according to the average movement of the Composite Consumer Price Index and the Nominal Wage Index.

LCQ8: Combating activities relating to duty-not-paid cigarettes,2025-09-25 11:00,2025-09-25 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092300405.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Kennedy Wong and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 It has been reported that the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) indicated that a total of 12 441 cases of cross-boundary travellers smuggling cigarettes were detected in the first half of this year. Regarding the combating of activities relating to duty-not-paid cigarettes (illicit cigarettes), will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of Hong Kong residents and visitors caught smuggling or carrying excess quantities of cigarettes at various land boundary control points in the first half of this year, the changes in these figures as compared with the same period last year, and the respective quantities and values of the illicit cigarettes involved;

(2) given that according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Hong Kong received more than 20 million visitors in the first five months of this year, with Mainland visitors increasing by about 10 per cent year-on-year, whether the authorities have projected if the number of persons illegally carrying illicit cigarettes into Hong Kong will increase; if so, of the preventive measures in place; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) apart from increasing the penalty compoundable under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (Cap. 109) from $2,000 to $5,000 for bringing tobacco and other dutiable commodities into Hong Kong without proper declaration, of the publicity and educational efforts to be made by the authorities in future and the details of such efforts;

(4) it has been reported that advertisements and messages claiming to facilitate the sale and delivery of duty-not-paid illicit cigarettes to Hong Kong consumers via cross-boundary logistics channels have been posted on social media platforms, of the targeted countermeasures taken by the authorities to combat such smuggling; the number of relevant cases detected, the number of persons arrested and the dutiable value of the illicit cigarettes seized from 2024 to date;

(5) whether it has reviewed if the current staffing establishment of C&ED is sufficient to cope with the work of combating the bringing-in of illicit cigarettes; whether C&ED will consider increasing manpower to combat such contraventions; if C&ED will, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(6) whether C&ED has plans to adopt advanced and innovative technology to assist in combating illicit cigarettes in future; if so, of the details?

Reply:

President,

 Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (Cap. 109) (the Ordinance), tobacco products are dutiable commodities. Importers or manufacturers shall pay tobacco duty according to the specified rates under the Ordinance. To protect government revenue, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) has been combating smuggling and trading of illicit cigarettes on different fronts.

 Upon consultation with the Health Bureau and C&ED, my reply to Dr the Hon Kennedy Wong's question is as follows:

(1) & (2) C&ED has been adjusting their enforcement strategies to combat the smuggling of illicit tobacco into Hong Kong having regard to the actual situation. Since May this year, C&ED has been presenting the monthly statistics on the number of cases involving seizure of excessive tobacco and liquor and their relevant penalties at all boundary control points (BCPs) and issued press releases on cases involving sentencing to remind visitors of the severity and legal consequences of relevant illegal activities in order to enhance the deterrent effect.

 The respective number of Hong Kong residents and visitors arrested for smuggling or carrying excess quantities of cigarettes at land control points in the first half of 2024 and 2025 and the quantities and values of the illicit cigarettes involved are listed in the table below:

(3) The Tobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2025 (Amendment Bill) was passed by the Legislative Council on September 11, 2025 to implement a series of measures to combat illicit cigarettes, including raising the maximum penalty for relevant offences relating to duty-not-paid tobacco from a $1 million fine and two-year imprisonment to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment; listing the relevant offences under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) to enable C&ED to freeze assets associated with illicit tobacco activities; increasing the penalty for offences of failing to declare to Customs Officers compoundable under the Ordinance from $2,000 to $5,000; and requiring that cigarettes sold at a price lower than the tobacco duty be proved to be duty-paid. The above measures have taken immediate effect upon the gazettal of the Amendment Bill on September 19.

 C&ED has collaborated with relevant government departments, including the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office of the Department of Health, the Police and the Housing Department, to launch a series of publicity and educational activities. Information on the increased penalties has been disseminated to the community and the public through multiple channels, including broadcasting and publishing a new series of videos, audio clips and posters on major television channels, radios, newspapers and C&ED's official social media platforms, and publishing a series of posts on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Xiaohongshu, WeChat, etc.

 In addition to presenting the monthly statistics on the number of cases and penalties at all BCPs as mentioned above, C&ED also disseminates information on the relevant offences and penalties to visitors through promotion videos, audio clips and mega posters at all BCPs, including the airport, land control points, etc. This serves to remind visitors that carrying dutiable commodities in excess of the duty-free concessions upon immigration is illegal and of the seriousness of the offence. To enhance the awareness of visitors from the Mainland of the new penalties, C&ED has placed advertisements at prominent locations at some Mainland land control points and the handles in the train compartments of metros in the Mainland.

 C&ED will continue to visit public housing estates in various districts, trade unions, etc., to conduct interdepartmental anti-illicit cigarettepublicity and educational activities and seminars. C&ED will also put up posters and broadcast promotion videos in all the 18 districts of Hong Kong to enhance public awareness of the relevant offences and penalties.

(4) C&ED has been closely monitoring sale of illicit cigarettes on the internet and conducting cyber patrols. When suspected cases are detected, C&ED will follow up with investigation and request the relevant websites or social media platforms to block the accounts concerned and remove the relevant illicit cigarette advertisements. From January to August 2025, a total of 266 relevant advertisements have been removed.

 On combatting cross-boundary logistics smuggling, C&ED detected 766 cases from January 2024 to August 2025 and seized about 670 million illicit cigarettes in total, with a duty potential of about $2.21 billion. A total of 188 persons have been arrested.

 C&ED will strengthen intelligence gathering and closely monitor the latest updates of illicit cigarettes activities. It will continue to strengthen enforcement at BCPs to intercept the inflow of illicit cigarettes into local markets. If illegal activities are detected, C&ED will take resolute enforcement actions.

(5) and (6) C&ED has been putting forward the development of Smart Customs to enhance detection capability and clearance efficiency through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics to facilitate risk management. C&ED has fully deployed advanced non-intrusive inspection equipment, such as Computed Tomography Scanners with AI functions, auto-detection devices for X-ray checkers, Smart Under Vehicle Robots, Platform for X-ray Image Evaluation, Vehicle Inspection and Strategic Analysis System, etc., in order to combat illicit cigarettes activities more effectively. C&ED will introduce advanced equipment and innovative technologies as appropriate to continuously enhance the detection capabilities and enhance enforcement effectiveness in combatting illicit cigarette activities.

 In addition, C&ED has amended the Ordinance to implement a duty stamp system, requiring importers/local manufacturers to ensure that each package of duty-paid cigarettes is affixed with a duty stamp when being put on the market for sale. Through the application of anti-forgery features and related digital technologies, frontline officers of C&ED would be able to distinguish duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones in a more effective manner, enhancing efficiency of law enforcement. C&ED targets to implement the first phase of the duty stamp system in Q4 2026, with full implementation in Q2 2027.

 C&ED will review the staff establishment regularly and flexibly deploy resources to handle anti-illicit cigarette work."

立法會八題：打擊未完稅香煙活動,2025-09-25 11:00,2025-09-25 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092300404.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上黃英豪議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的書面答覆：

問題：

據報香港海關（海關）表示今年上半年共查獲12 441宗跨境旅客走私香煙的案件。就打擊未完稅香煙（私煙）活動，政府可否告知本會：

（一）當局於本年上半年在各陸路口岸檢獲走私／超額攜帶香煙的港人與旅客數目、該等數字與去年同期比較的變化、涉及的私煙數量和價值分別為何；

（二）鑑於根據香港旅遊發展局的資料，今年首五個月訪港旅客人次超過2 000萬，其中內地旅客按年增加約百分之十，當局有否預計違規攜帶私煙入境的人士數目會否有所增加；如會，有何預防措施；如否，原因為何；

（三）針對沒有申報下攜帶煙草等應課稅貨品進入香港的行為，除了把《應課稅品條例》（第109章）下有代價地不予檢控罪行的罰款額，由2,000元提高至5,000元，當局在未來有何宣傳教育工作，以及有關工作的詳情為何；

（四）據報有人透過社交平台發布廣告和帖文，聲稱可配合跨境物流渠道向香港消費者銷售及運送未完稅私煙，當局採取了甚麼具針對性的應對措施，以打擊透過跨境物流走私香煙的行為；二○二四年至今當局偵破相關案件數目、被拘捕人士數目和檢獲私煙的應課稅值分別為何；

（五）有否檢視目前海關的人手編制是否足夠應付打擊攜帶私煙入境的工作；海關會否考慮增加人手打擊相關違規行為；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（六）海關未來有否計劃採用先進和創新科技協助打擊私煙；如有，詳情為何？

答覆：

主席︰

根據《應課稅品條例》（第109章）（《條例》），煙草產品屬應課稅品，入口商或製造商須按《條例》的稅率繳交煙草稅。為保障政府收入，香港海關（海關）一直從不同層面打擊走私和販賣私煙活動。

就黃英豪議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局及海關後，我回覆如下︰

（一）及（二）海關一直根據實際情況調整執法策略，以防止私煙流入香港。海關自今年五月起於各口岸展示每月查獲攜帶超額煙酒案件數字及相應罰則，並針對涉及判刑的案件發放新聞稿，提醒旅客相關違法行為的嚴重性和法律後果，以加強阻嚇作用。

二○二四年及二○二五年的上半年在各陸路口岸因涉及走私／超額攜帶香煙被捕的香港居民與旅客數目、涉及的私煙數量和價值載列於下表︰

（三）立法會於二○二五年九月十一日通過《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》，推行一系列加強打擊私煙的措施，包括：將未完稅煙草相關的最高罰則由罰款100萬元及監禁兩年提高至罰款200萬元及監禁七年；把有關罪行列入《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章），容許海關凍結與違法煙草活動相關的資產；將《條例》下有代價地就未有向海關人員作出申報罪行不予檢控的罰則由2,000元提高至5,000元；以及規定售價低於煙草稅的煙支須證明已課稅。上述措施於修訂條例在九月十九日刊憲後已即時生效。

海關已聯同相關政府部門（包括衞生署控煙酒辦公室、警方和房屋署）展開了一連串宣傳教育工作，透過不同渠道向社區及市民發放有關加強罰則的資訊，包括於各大電視台、電台、報章及海關的官方社交平台播放及刊載全新一輯的短片、聲帶、海報，以及在社交媒體（例如：Facebook、Instagram、小紅書、微信等）刊登一系列帖文。

海關除了如上文提及在各口岸展示每月查獲案件數字及罰則外，亦在各入境管制站，包括機場和陸路口岸等，透過宣傳短片、聲帶和大型海報，向訪港旅客發布有關罪行和罰則的信息，提醒他們入境時攜帶超額免稅品屬違法及其嚴重性。為了提高內地旅客對新罰則的認知，海關亦在部分內地陸路口岸的顯眼位置及內地地鐵列車的拉手上放置宣傳廣告。

海關將繼續到訪各區公共屋邨、商會等進行跨部門反私煙宣傳教育活動及講座，亦會在全港十八區張貼海報和播放宣傳短片，以加強市民對相關罪行和罰則的認知。

（四）海關一直密切監察網上售賣私煙活動及進行網上巡邏。如發現懷疑個案，除跟進調查外，亦會要求有關網站或社交平台封鎖有關帳戶及移除相關私煙廣告。在二○二五年一月至八月期間，共有266個相關廣告已下架。

在打擊跨境物流走私案件方面，海關在二○二四年一月至二○二五年八月期間共偵破766宗案件，檢獲私煙約6.7億支，應課稅值約22.1億元，共拘捕188人。

海關會加強情報蒐集工作，密切留意私煙活動的最新情況，並繼續在邊境管制站加強執法力度，阻截私煙流入本地市場。如發現違法行為，海關會採取果斷執法行動。

（五）及（六）海關一直致力推進智慧海關，以提升偵測能力及清關效率，透過人工智能技術及大數據分析協助風險管理，並在各邊境管制站全面利用先進非入侵式查驗設備，例如具備人工智能的電腦斷層掃描檢查系統、X光檢查器自動偵測儀、智能車底機械人、X光影像分析支援系統、車輛查驗策略分析系統等，以更有效打擊私煙活動。海關會適時引入合適先進儀器和創新科技，持續加強偵測能力，提高執法成效以打擊私煙活動。

此外，海關已修訂《條例》以引入完稅標籤制度，規定進口商／本地製造商須確保每包已完稅香煙在市場銷售時均附貼完稅標籤，並透過應用防偽特徵及相關數碼技術，讓海關前線人員能更有效地分辨已完稅煙和未完稅煙，提升執法效率。海關預計完稅標籤制度的第一階段將在二○二六年第四季推出，並在二○二七年第二季全面實施。

海關會繼續定期檢視人手編制，並靈活調配資源處理反私煙工作。"
Speech by FS at Routes World 2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-09-25 10:38,2025-09-25 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500482.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Routes World 2025 today (September 25):

Fred (Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam), Steven (Managing Director of Routes, Mr Steven Small), Vivian (Chief Executive Officer of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mrs Vivian Cheung),distinguished guests from the aviation industry, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. A very warm welcome to Routes World 2025. It is a great pleasure to join so many distinguished leaders and professionals from across the global aviation sector. While the inclement weather may have disrupted some of your plans to explore our city, I trust it has also offered you a glimpse into Hong Kong's resilience in tackling climate challenges, and the efficiency of our world-class city management.

First of all, thank you for hosting this landmark 30th edition of Routes World in Hong Kong. Over the next couple of days, you'll be sharing insights and experiences, and exploring the future pathways for air route development. These discussions are vital not only for shaping the future of global aviation, but also for fostering deeper economic collaboration, as well as understanding and friendship among peoples. I am proud that Hong Kong is serving as the meeting point for such meaningful dialogues.

We meet at a time of remarkable momentum in global aviation. According to the IATA, global air passenger traffic grew by over 10 per cent year-on-year in 2024. And despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, regional conflicts and economic uncertainties, passenger demand is projected to rise by another 6per cent this year. Air cargo volume is also expected to grow slightly, reaching 69 million tonnes. This growth is accompanied by a positive outlook on airline revenues and profitability, supported in part by more stable fuel prices.

Much of the above expansion and vitality is led by the Asia-Pacific region, where China accounts for over 40per cent of the regional traffic. Other regions, such as the Middle East, Latin America and Africa, are also seeing significant growth.

Hong Kong is benefiting from this global boom. Last year, our airport handled 53 million passengers, an increase of 34per cent year-on-year. In the first eight months of this year, we welcomed 40 million passengers, up another 15per cent. For 14 of the past 15 years, the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) has been the world's busiest cargo airport.

Today, our airport operates over 1 000 flights daily, connecting more than 210 destinations worldwide through some 140 airlines. To meet the rising demand, we are making substantial investments in our aviation infrastructure. The commissioning of the Three-Runway System last year was a major milestone. It enables our airport to handle up to 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2035.

Complementing this is the HKIA's ""SKYTOPIA"" development plan, which will transform our airport from an aviation hub into a world-leading landmark for commerce, tourism, arts and leisure. It is indeed a visionary project, featuring art storage facilities, a state-of-the-art sportainment complex, Hong Kong's largest yacht marina, and more.

Thanks to our international connectivity, Hong Kong also serves as the preferred gateway for international travel by residents in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Currently, around 20per cent of our airport's passengers come from the GBA. With rising travel demand from this region, we see immense potential for this number to grow even further. To support this, we are enhancing the intermodal transport network in the GBA, and streamlining immigration and customs clearance procedures, to facilitate more efficient flows of passengers and cargo.

The world is changing rapidly, with geopolitics reshaping global economic dynamics and patterns of passenger travel.

  Notwithstanding this, China remains firmly committed to high-level two-way opening up, welcoming more international businesses and travellers. Its expanding unilateral visa exemption for more and more countries is a good case in point. Hong Kong’s role as a gateway to the Mainland will only grow stronger. As a matter of fact, in the first eight months of this year, travellers to Hong Kong from outside the Chinese Mainland reached 7.7 million, rising by 16per cent year-on-year.

In this connection, we are not only reinforcing ties with traditional partners in Europe and North America, but also expanding our network across the Global South, including ASEAN, the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America. We are actively working to introduce new destinations and increase flight frequencies with emerging markets, particularly for long-haul routes.

These efforts are already bearing fruit. Over the past two years, we have expanded bilateral air services agreements with more than 10 economies. In the past two months, we reached consensus with Chile and Poland respectively to work on new air services agreements that will further strengthen our connectivity with the economies in those regions.

Equally important is our commitment to sustainability. In the Policy Address delivered last week, we presented Hong Kong's vision in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). That includes developing the related industry chain in the GBA, the whole chain from upstream to downstream. This initiative will support our goal of achieving the targeted SAF consumption ratio for flights departing from the HKIA by 2030, and in becoming a leader in SAF in this region.

Ladies and gentlemen, events like Routes World provide an invaluable platform to build partnerships and foster collaboration. I invite you to make the most of the programmes and networking opportunities over the coming days.

My sincere thanks to Informa Markets and the Airport Authority Hong Kong for bringing this exceptional event to reality. Thank you all, and I wish you a productive and inspiring conference."
Speech by FS at Routes World 2025 (English only),2025-09-25 10:38,2025-09-25 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500482.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Routes World 2025 today (September 25):

Fred (Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam), Steven (Managing Director of Routes, Mr Steven Small), Vivian (Chief Executive Officer of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mrs Vivian Cheung),distinguished guests from the aviation industry, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. A very warm welcome to Routes World 2025. It is a great pleasure to join so many distinguished leaders and professionals from across the global aviation sector. While the inclement weather may have disrupted some of your plans to explore our city, I trust it has also offered you a glimpse into Hong Kong's resilience in tackling climate challenges, and the efficiency of our world-class city management.

First of all, thank you for hosting this landmark 30th edition of Routes World in Hong Kong. Over the next couple of days, you'll be sharing insights and experiences, and exploring the future pathways for air route development. These discussions are vital not only for shaping the future of global aviation, but also for fostering deeper economic collaboration, as well as understanding and friendship among peoples. I am proud that Hong Kong is serving as the meeting point for such meaningful dialogues.

We meet at a time of remarkable momentum in global aviation. According to the IATA, global air passenger traffic grew by over 10 per cent year-on-year in 2024. And despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, regional conflicts and economic uncertainties, passenger demand is projected to rise by another 6per cent this year. Air cargo volume is also expected to grow slightly, reaching 69 million tonnes. This growth is accompanied by a positive outlook on airline revenues and profitability, supported in part by more stable fuel prices.

Much of the above expansion and vitality is led by the Asia-Pacific region, where China accounts for over 40per cent of the regional traffic. Other regions, such as the Middle East, Latin America and Africa, are also seeing significant growth.

Hong Kong is benefiting from this global boom. Last year, our airport handled 53 million passengers, an increase of 34per cent year-on-year. In the first eight months of this year, we welcomed 40 million passengers, up another 15per cent. For 14 of the past 15 years, the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) has been the world's busiest cargo airport.

Today, our airport operates over 1 000 flights daily, connecting more than 210 destinations worldwide through some 140 airlines. To meet the rising demand, we are making substantial investments in our aviation infrastructure. The commissioning of the Three-Runway System last year was a major milestone. It enables our airport to handle up to 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2035.

Complementing this is the HKIA's ""SKYTOPIA"" development plan, which will transform our airport from an aviation hub into a world-leading landmark for commerce, tourism, arts and leisure. It is indeed a visionary project, featuring art storage facilities, a state-of-the-art sportainment complex, Hong Kong's largest yacht marina, and more.

Thanks to our international connectivity, Hong Kong also serves as the preferred gateway for international travel by residents in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Currently, around 20per cent of our airport's passengers come from the GBA. With rising travel demand from this region, we see immense potential for this number to grow even further. To support this, we are enhancing the intermodal transport network in the GBA, and streamlining immigration and customs clearance procedures, to facilitate more efficient flows of passengers and cargo.

The world is changing rapidly, with geopolitics reshaping global economic dynamics and patterns of passenger travel.

  Notwithstanding this, China remains firmly committed to high-level two-way opening up, welcoming more international businesses and travellers. Its expanding unilateral visa exemption for more and more countries is a good case in point. Hong Kong’s role as a gateway to the Mainland will only grow stronger. As a matter of fact, in the first eight months of this year, travellers to Hong Kong from outside the Chinese Mainland reached 7.7 million, rising by 16per cent year-on-year.

In this connection, we are not only reinforcing ties with traditional partners in Europe and North America, but also expanding our network across the Global South, including ASEAN, the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America. We are actively working to introduce new destinations and increase flight frequencies with emerging markets, particularly for long-haul routes.

These efforts are already bearing fruit. Over the past two years, we have expanded bilateral air services agreements with more than 10 economies. In the past two months, we reached consensus with Chile and Poland respectively to work on new air services agreements that will further strengthen our connectivity with the economies in those regions.

Equally important is our commitment to sustainability. In the Policy Address delivered last week, we presented Hong Kong's vision in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). That includes developing the related industry chain in the GBA, the whole chain from upstream to downstream. This initiative will support our goal of achieving the targeted SAF consumption ratio for flights departing from the HKIA by 2030, and in becoming a leader in SAF in this region.

立法會一題：監察盛事活動的質素,2025-09-25 10:00,2025-09-25 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500408.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上田北辰議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的答覆︰

問題：

據報早前於中環海濱舉行的熱氣球節活動，因未獲發相關牌照而未能安排熱氣球載客，引起市民不滿。有意見認為，事件令香港盛事之都的聲譽受損。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府表示相關部門在審批上述活動時，觀察到熱氣球運作曾出現難以穩定控制的情況，因此批出的牌照並不包括接載乘客，但其後主辦機構仍繼續以熱氣球載客活動為宣傳重點，就此政府會否採取跟進行動；

（二）據悉香港旅遊發展局網頁曾宣傳上述活動，令人誤以為該活動獲官方支持，該局在挑選活動作宣傳時的準則為何，以及會否監察有關活動的進度和質素，以避免活動出現問題時令政府尷尬；及

（三）鑑於有意見指出，過去兩年多個於政府場地舉辦的盛事活動均出現令人失望的安排，而政府於本年一月八日回覆本人的補充質詢時表示，將研究機制防止盛事活動令香港聲譽受損，至今有關工作的進展為何？

答覆：

主席：

就田北辰議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局、發展局、民政及青年事務局及運輸及物流局後，現答覆如下：

就如行政長官早前提到，政府在推動盛事及活動在港舉行時，主要有三方面的角色，包括監管、推動和場地租賃。對於政府主辦、資助或支持的活動，政府都會全力監督，確保有關活動符合法例的要求，並妥善舉行。就政府沒有資助或參與籌辦的活動，我們樂見其成，尤其是新穎有趣，受市民及旅客歡迎的活動，政府會盡量提供便利和協助，亦會協助活動的宣傳。但有一點十分重要，就是所有活動主辦機構有責任確保活動安全及穩妥進行、須符合各項所需牌照及許可的要求。對於涉及安全風險和技術要求較高的活動，政府會嚴格監管，以安全為首，並會考慮同類型活動以往在香港舉行的情況，以及主辦機構以往舉辦同類型活動的經驗及往績。

在場地租賃的角色方面，就今次香港國際熱氣球節（熱氣球節）舉行的場地中環海濱活動空間而言，政府現時以短期租約批出活動空間給承租人，再由承租人租予外間機構組織活動，務求能善用市場的靈活及創意。舉辦的活動大部分均是租用團體與承租人之間的商業安排，由承租人在符合租約和法規後自行決定。

就問題三個部分，我回覆如下：

（一）熱氣球節是一項由私人機構舉辦的商業活動，而非政府主辦、資助或支持活動。主辦機構於今年四月通知有關政府部門已承租了中環海濱活動空間舉辦熱氣球節，並希望部門能就活動所需牌照的申請事宜提供協助。主辦機構於七月八日向相關部門申請活動所需牌照（註）。過程中，相關部門與主辦機構保持緊密溝通，積極提供協助及專業意見。然而，鑑於主辦機構在八月二十日進行實地熱氣球測試的效果未如理想，安全風險顯著，相關部門經審慎並全面考慮公眾安全的情況下，於八月二十七日與主辦機構會面時通知他們，只可以在他們成功進行實地熱氣球測試後，相關部門才會考慮批准在活動中展示熱氣球的所需牌照。至於在載客熱氣球方面，由於主辦機構表示只能於活動前一至兩天再次進行測試，部門在會上清晰向主辦機構表示，由於時間倉猝，載客熱氣球的成功審批機會微乎其微，建議主辦機構盡早向外公布取消載客熱氣球的項目，並為已購票人士安排退款或作其他補償。主辦機構最後於九月三日（即活動舉辦前一天）進行另一次測試。政府相關部門經審慎並全面考慮公眾的安全情況下，於九月四日批准熱氣球在活動中展示。

消費者委員會（消委會）和香港海關（海關）在接獲有關熱氣球節的投訴後，一直密切跟進相關投訴。消委會在事件發生後已即時呼籲主辦機構考慮向受影響人士退款，並提醒持票人士應保留門票、收據等，若日後需要追討，亦可保障自身權益。消委會在得悉主辦機構宣布退款賠償方案後，已促請主辦機構加派人手，盡快處理電話查詢、與已提出退款申請的持票人士進行確認以及於承諾的限期前安排退款。消委會正繼續與主辦機構保持聯絡，跟進已接獲的投訴個案。此外，海關亦正就已接獲的舉報作出跟進。如發現有違反《商品說明條例》的情況，海關將會採取適當執法行動。

（二）香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）支持盛事活動及評估對活動的支持程度時，會考慮和平衡不同因素，包括活動能否吸引市民和旅客參與；能否在全球營造正面曝光，展示香港在文化藝術、體育等方面的獨特魅力；以及能否展示香港的策略性地位等。

為配合政府推動旅遊的工作，除了旅發局舉辦或支持的活動外，旅發局近年亦在Discover Hong Kong網站介紹政府的大型活動，以及其他機構自行舉辦的大型活動，並作出持續更新，方便旅客和市民一站式閱覽城中最新的活動資訊和規劃行程。然而，旅發局無法保證由私人機構舉辦的活動的質素。經過今次事件後，旅發局將會在網站加上清晰的活動分項或備註，令大眾能知悉活動的舉辦單位。當活動出現問題時，旅發局會就其所知作出適時的活動更新，包括立即於網站抽起有關活動。

（三）我於一月八日的立法會會議回答田議員提問時指出，我們會不斷檢視政府資助活動的合約條款，以確保資助物有所值，活動能為香港帶來增值，更加絕對不可令香港聲譽受損。事實上，我們早前已經完成檢視「M」品牌大型體育盛事和文化藝術盛事基金，並公布了加強審批機制和後續監察的措施，目標正是更精準地為吸引旅客參與的盛事提供財政支援。

至於熱氣球節的場地，即中環海濱活動空間的用地，現時租約於二○二六年六月完結，發展局正準備於今年第四季為短期租約重新招標。發展局會因應歷年的經驗，優化租約條款，既善用土地引入多元活動，亦從風險角度強化場地管理安排，包括強化租約承租人把關角色，以及加強預警通報機制，讓發展局需要時適當介入。

註：包括由民航處發出的「不定期航班服務許可證」，以及食物環境衞生署發出的「臨時公眾娛樂場所牌照」。"
LCQ1: Monitoring the quality of mega events,2025-09-25 10:00,2025-09-25 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500414.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Michael Tien and a reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

It has been reported that the hot air balloon festival held earlier on at the Central Harbourfront failed to arrange for hot air balloons to carry passengers because the relevant licences had not been granted, resulting in public dissatisfaction. There are views that the incident has damaged Hong Kong's reputation as an events capital. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as the Government has indicated that, when vetting and approving the aforesaid event, the relevant departments observed that there were instances where hot air balloons were difficult to control, and therefore the licence granted did not include the carriage of passengers, but the organiser continued to use the hot air balloon passenger activities as the focus of its publicity subsequently, whether the Government will take follow-up actions in this regard;

(2) as it is learnt that the aforesaid activity was publicised on the Hong Kong Tourism Board's website, creating the false impression that it was officially endorsed, of the criteria adopted by the Board for selecting activities for publicity, and whether it will monitor the progress and quality of the activities concerned, in order to avoid embarrassing the Government when problems with the activities arise; and

(3) as there are views pointing out that many mega events held at government venues in the past two years have made disappointing arrangements, and the Government indicated in its reply to my supplementary question on January 8 this year that it would study a mechanism to prevent mega events from damaging Hong Kong's reputation, of the progress of the relevant work so far?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau and the Transport and Logistics Bureau, our reply to the question raised by the Hon Michael Tien is as follows:

As the Chief Executive mentioned earlier, the Government plays three key roles, including regulating, promoting and venue renting, in the promotion of mega events and activities in Hong Kong. For events organised, funded or supported by the Government, the Government will do its utmost to ensure that the events comply with the legal requirement and are held properly. We also welcome events that the Government does not fund or participate in organising, especially novel and interesting events that are popular among the public and visitors. The Government will endeavour to facilitate and provide assistance, and will also help promote the events. However, it is crucial that all event organisers bear the responsibility to ensure the safe and orderly execution of their activities, and the strict compliance with all necessary license and permit requirements. For events involving high safety risks and technical requirements, the Government will strictly monitor them by prioritising safety and taking into account similar events held in Hong Kong and the organisers' experience and track record in hosting similar events in the past.

Regarding the role of venue rental, the Government currently leases the Central Harbourfront Event Space, the venue for the Hong Kong International Hot Air Balloon Festival (the Festival), to a tenant on a short-term basis. The tenant then rents the space to external organisations for hosting events, leveraging market flexibility and creativity. The majority of events held are commercial arrangements between the hiring organisation and the tenant, with the tenant making its own decisions, subject to compliance with the lease agreement and regulations.

My response to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The Festival was a commercial event organised by a private entity and was not organised, funded or supported by the Government. In April this year, the organiser notified the relevant Government departments that it had leased the Central Harbourfront Event Space for the Festival and sought assistance in applying for the necessary permits. On July 8, the organiser applied for the necessary licenses (Note) from the relevant departments. Throughout the process, the relevant departments maintained close communication with the organiser, actively providing assistance and professional advice. However, in consideration that the results of the organiser's on-site hot air balloon demonstration on August 20 were unsatisfactory and the safety risks were significant, the relevant departments, after cautious and comprehensive consideration of public safety, informed the organiser during a meeting on August 27 that, only after an on-site hot air balloon demonstration could be successfully conducted would the relevant departments consider issuing the necessary licenses to display hot air balloons at the Festival. Regarding hot air balloons for carrying passengers, as the organiser stated that it could only conduct another demonstration one to two days before the Festival, the relevant departments clearly stated to the organiser at the meeting that, due to the tight time schedule, the chance of granting approval was extremely slim, and recommended the organiser to publicly announce the cancellation of the carrying passengers part as soon as possible and arrange refunds or other compensation for those who had already purchased the tickets. The organiser eventually conducted another demonstration on September 3, the day before the Festival. After cautious and comprehensive consideration of public safety, the relevant departments approved the display of hot air balloons at the Festival on September 4.

Upon receipt of the complaints relating to the Festival, the Consumer Council and the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) have been closely following up. Shortly after the incident, the Consumer Council urged the organiser to consider offering refunds to affected persons, and reminded ticketholders to retain the tickets and receipts for protecting their rights and interests in case of future claims. After the organiser announced a refund plan, the Consumer Council has called on the organiser to deploy additional staff to expedite the handling of telephone enquiries, confirm with the ticketholders who have submitted the claims and make refund arrangement before the promised deadline. The Consumer Council continues to maintain contact with the organiser and is following up on the complaints. Furthermore, the C&ED is also following up on the reports received. The C&ED will take appropriate enforcement action in case there are violations of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.

(2) The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) considers and balances various factors when assessing the level of support for mega events, including whether the events can attract participation from the public and visitors; whether they can create positive global exposure and showcase Hong Kong's unique charm in culture, arts, sports and other areas; and whether they can demonstrate Hong Kong's strategic position.

To support the efforts on tourism promotion, in addition to events organised or supported by the HKTB, the HKTB has also been featuring major events organised by the Government and large-scale events organised by other organisations on the Discover Hong Kong website in recent years. This website is continuously updated, providing public and visitors with a one-stop access to the latest event information and itinerary planning. However, the HKTB cannot guarantee the quality of events organised by private entities. Following this incident, the HKTB will introduce clear event categorisation or annotations on its website so that the public will know who the event organiser is. If there are any issues arising from an event, the HKTB will provide timely updates to its website based on available information, including removing the events from the website in the first instance.

(3) In response to the question from the Hon Tien at the Legislative Council meeting on January 8, I stated that we would continuously review the terms of Government funded events to ensure that the funding provided was value for money, added value to Hong Kong, and did not damage Hong Kong's reputation. In fact, we had already completed the review on the ""M"" Mark Major Sports Events and the Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund, and announced measures to strengthen the vetting mechanism and subsequent monitoring, and provide more targeted financial support for events that attract tourist participation.

âAs for the venue for the Festival, the Central Harbourfront Event Space, the current tenancy will be terminated in June 2026. The Development Bureau is preparing to launch re-tendering of the short-term tenancy in the fourth quarter of this year. Based on the experience over the years, the Development Bureau will enhance the relevant tenancy terms so as to make good use of the site for activities of different kinds, while strengthening management of the venue from the perspective of risk management by, say, imposing a stronger gatekeeping role on the tenant, and putting in place an early alert and notification mechanism for timely and appropriate intervention by the Development Bureau.

Note: These include the ""Non-scheduled Service Permit"" issued by the Civil Aviation Department and the ""Temporary Places of Public Entertainment Licence"" issued by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department."

Government fully committed to minimising impact of Super Typhoon Ragasa on Hong Kong (with photos),2025-09-24 23:45,2025-09-25 00:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092401544.htm,"âSuper Typhoon Ragasa brought hurricane-force winds to many parts of Hong Kong, causing flooding in coastal and low-lying areas due to overtopping waves and storm surges. The steering committee on handling extreme weather, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, with thorough preparation and comprehensive planning, swiftly co-ordinated with various relevant government departments to minimise the impact of the typhoon on the public. As Ragasa gradually moved away from Hong Kong later this morning, various government departments, while prioritising safety, promptly initiated comprehensive recovery efforts to restore normalcy as quickly as possible.

Mr Chan visited this afternoon (September 24) a site in the Central and Western District affected by fallen trees and a landslide to inspect the clean-up and recovery progress by departments such as the Fire Services Department (FSD), the Highways Department (HyD), and the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO). He then chaired a meeting of the steering committee on handling extreme weather to receive updates from the heads of relevant bureaux and departments and comprehensively review emergency response and recovery efforts of various government departments.

Government departments are mobilising all necessary manpower and resources to expedite clearing obstacles from major roads and bus routes. According to current clean-up assessments by relevant departments, major roads and public transport are expected to reopen when the Hong Kong Observatory issues the Strong Wind Signal No. 3, allowing the city to resume normalcy.

The Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre under the Security Bureau was fully activated more than 24 hours before the Hong Kong Observatory issued the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal, ensuring the best priorities for emergency decision-making, striving to minimise the impact of the adverse weather on the public.

The Development Bureau (DEVB) is maintaining close liaison with various works departments and the Buildings Department (BD) to deploy resources of contractors to expedite the progress of the recovery work.

*Regarding flooding, 19 flooding cases have been confirmed as of 5pm today. With the efforts of the Drainage Services Department (DSD)'s emergency response teams and the assistance of the mobile powerful pumping robots, 14 cases have been resolved. The DSD is currently addressing the remaining five flooding cases and is confident of resolving them within one to two hours. The DSD conducted analysis and made deployment in advance before the onset of the super typhoon and was equipped with mobile powerful pumping robots on standby, contributing to the swift handling of possible flooding cases during the passage of the super typhoon in Hong Kong. Once all flooding cases have been resolved, the DSD will conduct inspections and carry out clearance at about 240 flood-prone locations. Additionally, the DSD will examine the drainage conditions of 80 major rivers and drainage channels to ensure their smooth operation.

*Regarding the safety of structures, the Emergency Control Centre of the BD has received a total of 25 emergency reports related to signboards and scaffoldings at construction sites, 22 of which have been resolved. The BD proactively inspected construction sites next to major roads in advance to reduce incidents caused by the super typhoon as much as possible. After the typhoon, the BD has also launched special patrols to identify potential dangers arising from loosened or damaged signboards, scaffoldings, windows and appendages along major roads and in high-risk buildings in various districts.

*Regarding landslides, as of 5pm, the GEO received a total of four reports of landslides in Sai Ying Pun, Tuen Mun, Stanley and Chung Pui. Two incidents involved slope and retaining wall failures caused by fallen trees. The GEO has arranged for geotechnical engineers to assist relevant departments for follow-up work. The Emergency Control Centre of the GEO will remain in operation to handle reports of landslide incidents received until the threat is lifted.

*Regarding fallen trees, various relevant departments will expedite the handling of them. To enhance efficiency, the DEVB earlier identified some 50 plots of government land in various districts for the departments' temporary storage of fallen trees and debris in nearby areas before sending them to landfills for disposal. After the passage of the typhoon, tree management departments will inspect trees in areas with high pedestrian and vehicular flow and take appropriate measures, including stabilising trees, removing dangling broken branches, and removing fallen or unstable trees. In case of blockage of rural roads caused by fallen trees, members of the public may seek assistance through the 1823 Mobile App, by calling 1823 or sending an email to tellme@1823.gov.hk. Cases will be referred to relevant departments for follow-up as appropriate

In addition, after typhoons and rainstorms, trees, slopes and the structures may also be affected due to a large intake of water into soil and surface layers. Members of the public should therefore remain vigilant when going outdoors and avoid prolonged stays under trees, slopes and structures with signs of concrete spalling.

The FSD, by 5pm today, handled a total of 143 reports of people trapped in lifts, 454 reports from automatic fire alarm systems, 393 reports of fallen trees and two reports of landslides. Assistance was provided to 61 people to safe places in 16 flooding incidents. The FSD has co-ordinated with various departments, including the HyD and the Transport Department (TD), for rapid clearing of fallen trees blocking major roads, ensuring the smooth flow of main roads and rescue routes remain unobstructed. Relevant work will be carried out overnight.

The Emergency Transport Coordination Centre (ETCC) of the TD has escalated its operational level and has been operating round the clock throughout the typhoon. It closely monitored traffic and transport conditions on major routes, including trunk roads, tunnels and bridges across the territory. The ETCC expedited assessment of the typhoon's impact on traffic with relevant departments and public transport operators, and steered operators to conduct site checks along their routes to ensure safe operations before gradually resuming normal services, such as railway and franchised buses. In addition, the TD conducted ongoing review of situations at various trunk roads and link roads at locations without alternative routes. This helped the prompt identification of locations affected by flooding or obstructed by objects requiring higher priority of clearance and co-ordination of clearance work of departments concerned, with a view to reopening blocked roads and fully resuming public transport services early.

The Emergency Control Centres of the HyD were activated on the morning of September 22. Officers of the HyD, together with road maintenance contractors, have been closely monitoring the latest conditions of major public roads in real time and responding promptly to emergencies caused by the inclement weather. As of 5pm, the department received approximately 1 620 reports of road incidents, including around 1 050 cases of fallen trees, around 85 cases of flooding and six reports of landslides. The department commenced patrolling major roads at 1.20pm, and the work has already been completed. Nearly 200 emergency response teams under the department also stand ready for deployment. The teams have been mobilised to remove fallen trees and obstructions on roads, to clear debris-clogged roadside drains and channels, as well as to carry out emergency cordoning-off and urgent repair works for collapsed slopes under safe conditions. The HyD will continue to make every effort to clear the remaining fallen trees and other road obstructions to restore normal traffic as soon as possible after the typhoon. In addition, the 16 pedestrian subways along Shing Mun River in Sha Tin, Lam Tsuen River and Tai Po River in Tai Po, which were temporarily closed last night due to inclement weather and storm surge, have been reopened starting from 5pm.

In view of the possible threats that Ragasa may pose to Hong Kong, the Home Affairs Department (HAD) and District Offices (DOs) had initiated relevant response measures in advance. They have co-ordinated with relevant departments and organisations to enhance preparedness, setting up sandbags and water-stop boards, among others. District Council (DC) members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams were mobilised to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to make necessary preparations. Residents in flood-prone areas were advised to stay away from their homes or stay at temporary shelters. All DOs opened temporary shelters in advance at 8am yesterday. During the tropical cyclone, a total of 50 temporary shelters were in operation with a total of about 900 residents, which is more than before. In addition, the HAD also activated a round-the-clock hotline in advance at noon on September 22 for public enquiries on the tropical cyclone and released information on the operation of temporary shelters through different channels continuously. The HAD's Emergency Co-ordination Centre began operation in the afternoon on the same day to co-ordinate work and information dissemination in 18 districts as well as promptly follow up on various incident reports.

After the typhoon, DOs will continue to co-ordinate support from other departments and organisations, and mobilise DC members, members of ""the three committees"", and Care Teams to provide appropriate assistance. This includes helping affected households, particularly households of singleton and doubleton elderly persons affected by severe flooding, remove stagnant water and restore their homes. As the weather in Hong Kong remains unstable, the temporary shelters under the HAD will continue to open during the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 to serve citizens in need until the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 is cancelled. In addition, DOs will co-ordinate with relevant departments and organisations to carry out relief work in their districts, enabling the community to resume normalcy as soon as possible to facilitate citizens' commuting to work or school.

To support government departments and the waste transfer sector in rapidly handling fallen trees and waste to restore normalcy as quickly as possible, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has been maintaining close communication with the industry during the past few days and implemented multiple measures. These include reserving sufficient temporary storage areas at the three landfills and Y·PARK for collecting and storing fallen tree waste, as well as preparing emergency sawing and wood-chipping equipment to facilitate rapid clean-up. Recyclable tree waste will be sorted out and sent to Y·PARK for recycling and reuse. Additionally, the EPD has allocated in advance manpower and machinery to ensure sufficient capacity at refuse transfer stations (RTS) and extended the operating hours of urban RTSs and the three landfills from today to September 26. Recovery works are now in full swing at the Island East Transfer Station which was affected by storm surge during the typhoon, with a view to resuming service at the soonest practicable time. The EPD will keep a close tab on the operation of waste handling facilities and flexibly redeploy resources to facilitate a swift return to normalcy.

In advance of the typhoon's approach, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has conducted inspections and cleaning of roadside gullies at flooding blackspots to minimise the risk of blockage caused by refuse and fallen leaves. The FEHD has also secured or removed some facilities such as litter containers placed in open areas, and has reminded operators of on-street hawker stalls to implement appropriate typhoon precautionary measures. Following the passage of the typhoon, the FEHD will resume street cleaning and refuse collection services as soon as possible, including deploying departmental and contractor cleaning staff to expedite the removal of refuse from major thoroughfares.

After the wind subsided, staff members of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) immediately inspected country parks for damage to facilities, fallen trees and road blockages. The AFCD also cleared fallen trees and arranged for repairs of damaged facilities to expedite the reopening of affected facilities for public use. As weather conditions remain unstable, there are still risks of flash floods, flooding, tree falls, and landslides in rural areas. The AFCD urges members of the public to refrain from outdoor activities.

During the typhoon, frontline police officers remained steadfast in carrying out their duties, taking appropriate actions based on the situation. These included urging the public to stay away from shorelines and flood-prone areas, deploying personnel to handle high-risk areas such as unstable scaffolding and precarious windows, and evacuating residents from affected areas. Officers also closely monitored traffic conditions and eased the traffic by assisting vehicles trapped by flooding or blocked by fallen trees and other obstacles. Fallen trees and other debris on roads were promptly cleared to reopen blocked roads as soon as possible.

The Housing Department (HD) Communication Centre was activated before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 was hoisted to get fully prepared in handling emergencies. During the passage of the tropical cyclone, frontline staff of the HD remained dedicated to delivering their duties and took all necessary precautionary measures. In addition, the emergency response team of the HD's construction sites stepped up vigilance and maintained close contact and collaboration with relevant government departments to promptly respond to possible emergency situations during the typhoon. They also worked with project teams and contractors to clear debris from nearby drainage outlets to effectively reduce the accumulation of muddy water on the roads in the vicinity and swiftly remove the water barriers misplaced by the strong wind to minimise traffic disruption.

The steering committee on handling extreme weather reminds the public that although the storm gradually moved away, the weather in Hong Kong remains unstable, and the public should continue to stay updated with the latest government announcements. The committee emphasises that staff from various government departments will continue to fulfil their duties, working together with various sectors to fully engage in community recovery efforts and provide appropriate support to those in need. Departmental personnel will continue to carry out relief work with contractors, enabling members of the public to resume a normal life as soon as possible."

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-09-24 20:21,2025-09-24 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092401155.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (September 24) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

陳國基今日（九月二十四日）下午到中西區一個塌樹及山泥傾瀉現場，實地視察情況，了解消防處、路政署及土力工程處等部門的清理善後進度。其後，陳國基主持應對極端天氣督導委員會會議，聽取相關局長和部門首長的最新匯報，全面檢視各政府部門最新的應急及善後工作進展。

各政府部門正投入一切所需人力和物力，加快處理主幹道及主要巴士路線的障礙物。根據目前各相關部門就不同善後工作的評估，各主要道路及公共交通預計可以在天文台改發三號強風信號時恢復通行，讓市面基本復常。

保安局轄下的緊急事故監察及支援中心於天文台發出八號烈風或暴風訊號逾24小時前已全面投入運作，確保應急決策優次獲得最佳保障，全力減低惡劣天氣對市民的影響。

發展局正與各工務部門及屋宇署保持緊密聯繫，調配承建商資源，以協助加快復常工程的進度。

＊處理水浸方面，截至今日下午五時，共有19宗確認水浸個案。經渠務署緊急應變隊伍的努力，以及強力排水機械人的協助下，已完成處理其中14宗水浸個案。現時正處理五宗水浸個案，渠務署有信心可以在一至兩小時處理妥當。渠務署在超強颱風侵襲前已預先進行分析及部署，再配合安排強力排水機械人戒備，以致可在超強颱風襲港時迅速處理可能出現的水浸個案。渠務署會於完成處理水浸個案後，巡查及清理全港約240個因渠道淤塞而容易水浸地點，以及檢查80條主要河道和渠道的排水情況，確保系統運作暢順。

＊構築物安全方面，屋宇署緊急事故控制中心共接獲25宗關於招牌及地盤棚架等緊急事故個案，至今已完成處理22宗個案。屋宇署在事前主動巡查主要街道旁的建築地盤，務求盡量減少超強颱風引致的事故個案。颱風過後，屋宇署亦已啓動特別街道巡查，以辨識各區主要街道旁及潛在風險較高樓宇的鬆脫或損毀的招牌、棚架、窗戶和構築物等。

＊山泥傾瀉方面，截至下午五時，土力工程處共接獲四宗山泥傾瀉報告，事故地點位於西營盤、屯門、赤柱和涌背，其中兩宗涉及塌樹引致斜坡和擋土牆損毀。土力工程處已安排土力工程師協助相關部門跟進事故。土力工程處的緊急控制中心會繼續運作，處理接獲的山泥傾瀉事故報告，直至威脅解除為止。

＊有關塌樹方面，各相關部門會加快處理倒塌的樹木，為了加快處理效率，發展局早前已經物色了50多幅分佈各區的政府土地，供各部門得以在就近臨時擺放這些塌樹及雜物，稍後再安排送往堆填區。在颱風過後，樹木管理部門會巡查位於人流車流高地區的樹木，採取相應措施，包括穩固樹木、移除懸吊斷枝、移除倒塌或根基不穩的樹木。倘若市民發現有塌樹堵塞鄉郊道路，可致電尋求協助。請透過手機應用程式（Tell me@1823） 、致電1823或電郵至tellme@1823.gov.hk，以便相關部門作適當跟進。

此外，颱風及暴雨過後樹木、斜坡及構建物亦可能因為泥土及表層大量吸水而受影響，市民外出時需保持警覺，盡量避免在樹下、斜坡及出現石屎剝落現象的構築物下長時間逗留。

消防處截至今日下午五時，共處理了143宗有人被困升降機報告，454宗自動報火警系統報告，393宗樹木倒塌報告，一宗山泥傾瀉報告，以及九宗水浸事故報告，當中在16宗水浸事故中共協助了61名市民到安全地方。消防處已協調路政署、運輸署等部門，盡快清理阻塞主要路段的塌樹，優先保障主幹道暢通及確保救援路線不受阻礙，並會繼續通宵進行有關工作。

運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心在颱風襲港期間一直24小時運作並提升級別，密切監察全港各區主要幹道、隧道和橋樑等重要道路的交通及運輸情況。協調中心與相關部門及公共運輸服務營辦商加快評估颱風對交通造成的影響，督導營辦商做好沿線檢視，確保安全穩妥後陸續恢復鐵路、專營巴士等正常服務。此外，署方持續檢視各主要幹道及沒有替代路線地點的連接道路清單，務求快捷分辨出須優先清理水浸和路面障礙物的位置，協調相關部門執行清理工作，盡快開通阻塞道路及讓公交服務恢復營運。

路政署緊急控制中心於九月二十二日早上已啟動，路政署人員一直聯同道路維修保養承建商實時監察主要公共道路的最新情況，迅速應對惡劣天氣引發的突發情況。截至下午五時，路政署共收到約1620宗道路事故報告，包括約1050宗塌樹、約85宗水浸和六宗山泥傾瀉報告等，本署已於下午一時二十分開始巡查主要道路工作, 並已完成。路政署轄下近200隊應急隊伍亦隨時候命，在安全情況下出動清理道路上的塌樹、障礙物及淤塞的道路集水溝和渠道，以及為倒塌的斜坡進行緊急圍封及搶修工程等。路政署會繼續全力以赴，清理餘下的塌樹及其他路面障礙，令交通在風暴過後得以迅速恢復正常。此外，因應惡劣天氣及風暴潮而於昨晚臨時封閉的沙田城門河、大埔林村河及大埔河沿岸16條行人隧道則已於下午五時開始重新開放。

因應樺加沙可能為香港帶來的威脅，民政事務總署（民政總署）及各區民政事務處（民政處）已預早啓動相關應對工作，協調相關部門和機構加強防備，設置沙包和擋水板等，亦動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊向區內易受水浸影響的居民發放最新的天氣資訊，提醒他們做好準備，以及勸喻居住水浸風險較高地區的居民及早遷離居所，或到臨時庇護中心暫避。各區民政處已提早於昨日上午八時開放臨時庇護中心，風暴期間一共開放50個臨時庇護中心，比以往開放的數目更多，期間共有約900人入住。另外，民政總署亦提前在九月二十二日中午設立了一條24小時緊急事故熱線供市民查詢熱帶氣旋消息，並持續透過不同途徑發布臨時庇護中心的運作資訊。民政總署緊急事故協調中心亦於同日下午運作，協調各區工作及傳遞信息，迅速跟進各項緊急事故報告。

在風暴過後，各區民政處會繼續協調其他部門和機構作出支援，並動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊提供適切協助，包括協助有需要的住戶，特別是受嚴重水浸影響的獨老和雙老住戶清理積水和復原受影響的家居。由於天氣仍然不穩定，民政處轄下的臨時庇護中心於三號強風信號下會繼續開放，供有需要市民入住，直至三號強風信號除下。另外，各區民政處會協調相關部門和機構於當區進行善後工作，以期讓市面盡快復常，利便市民出行、上班或上學。

環境保護署（環保署）為協助政府及業界於颱風後迅速處理塌樹及廢物以盡快復常，在過去數天一直與廢物運輸業界保持緊密溝通，並採取多項措施，包括在三個堆填區及Y·PARK [林．區]預留充足的臨時木料廢物收集區，接收及暫存塌樹廢物，並預早準備應急的鋸木及碎木機，以盡快協助清理塌樹廢物，當中可回收的樹木將被送往Y-PARK回收再造。另外，環保署在颱風襲港前已事先調配人手及機械，為廢物轉運站預留充足容量，並且在九月二十四至二十六日延長各市區廢物轉運站和三個堆填區的開放時間。在颱風期間受風暴潮影響的港島東廢物轉運站現正搶修中，將盡快重開。環保署並會繼續密切留意各廢物處理設施的運作情況並靈活調配資源，全力協助盡快復常。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）在颱風來臨前已提早巡查並清理容易出現水浸黑點的路邊集水溝渠，減少垃圾和樹葉導致溝渠淤塞的風險。食環署亦已加強固定或移走設於露天地方的廢屑箱等設施，並提醒街上小販排檔做好防風措施。颱風過後，食環署會盡快恢復街道潔淨服務及垃圾收集服務，包括調動署方及承辦商潔淨工作人員加快清理主要街道上的垃圾。

颱風過後，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）人員隨即到各郊野公園巡查，檢視設施損壞、樹木倒塌及道路阻塞的情況，並清理塌樹及安排維修損毀設施，以期盡快重新開放受影響設施供市民使用。鑑於天氣仍然不穩定，郊區仍有山洪暴發、水浸、塌樹和山泥傾瀉的風險，漁護署強烈勸諭市民取消所有戶外活動。

風暴期間，前線警務人員堅守崗位，因應情況採取適當行動，包括到場勸喻市民遠離海邊及水浸黑點、調配人手處理高風險位置，例如有機會倒塌的棚架及窗戶，以及協助受影響居民疏散。人員亦密切監察交通情況，協助受水浸或被倒樹及障礙物阻擋的車輛，疏導交通。路面上的倒樹及其他雜物被即時切割及清除，務求盡快重新開通阻塞道路。

房屋署聯絡中心於八號熱帶氣旋警告發出前已預先啓動，準備隨時處理突發事故。在熱帶氣旋襲港期間，房屋署前線同事緊守崗位，作出應對防範措施。此外，各施工地盤的緊急應變小組亦提高警覺，與相關政府部門保持緊密聯繫和協作，迅速應對颱風下可能出現的突發情況，並與工程團隊與承建商清理附近排水口雜物，有效減少泥水於附近路面積聚，以及迅速清理被強風吹至移位的水馬，避免影響附近交通及市民出行。

應對極端天氣督導委員會提醒市民，雖然風暴正遠離香港，但現時本港天氣仍然不穩定，大家應繼續留意政府發放的最新消息。委員會強調，政府各部門人員會繼續恪守職責，聯同社會各界全力進行社區復原工作，以及向有需要的市民提供適切支援。各部門人員及有關合約承建商會繼續推進善後工作，讓市民儘快回復正常生活。"

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得22宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（九月十四日至九月二十日）廣東省新增2 771宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別201宗（九月七日至十三日）及178宗（八月三十一日至九月六日）顯著增加，當中2 583宗個案在江門市錄得。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至八月，全球16個國家／地區呈報了約31萬7千宗基孔肯雅熱病例及135宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-24 17:30,2025-09-24 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400939.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 24), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 22 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 771 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (September 14 to 20), a significant increase compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 201 cases (September 7 to 13) and 178 cases (August 31 to September 6) respectively, in which 2 583 cases were recorded in Jiangmen. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also the Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."
