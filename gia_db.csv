基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-17 17:30,2026-01-17 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/17/P2026011700655.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月十七日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
​
市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-17 17:30,2026-01-17 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/17/P2026011700661.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 17), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

​The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

At around 2pm yesterday, a worker sustained injury when his left palm was severed while attempting to clear stuck debris at an operating wood chipping machine. He remained conscious and was sent to Tuen Mun Hospital for treatment. The EPD immediately deployed staff to the hospital after the incident to understand the condition of the injured and provide his family members with appropriate assistance.

  The EPD notified the Labour Department and the Police in the first instance. Staff from the Labour Department conducted on-site inspection and issued a suspension notice to the contractor, requiring suspension of operation of the concerned machinery until all improvement measures have been implemented. The EPD requested the contractor to fully co-operate with the Labour Department in its investigation, and demanded an incident report from the contractor within three days.

The safety of its facilities remains the top priority of the EPD, with close monitoring of contractors' operation in place. On the contractor's front, daily regular on-site inspections on occupational safety conditions and safety training for employees and its subcontractors are part of their requirements."

何俊亨主席（仁愛堂主席）、各位董事局成員、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

​大家好！我很高興出席今晚的仁愛堂周年慈善餐舞會，與各位一同回顧仁愛堂努力耕耘的豐碩成果，同時為仁愛堂各項福利服務籌募善款，造福社會。

今年餐舞會以「綠野仙蹤」為主題，寓意只要懷抱勇氣、智慧與愛心，就可以陪伴弱勢社群跨越困難、走向美好。這份精神，正正與仁愛堂多年來的工作互相呼應，實在別具意義。​

​仁愛堂由最初一間為貧苦大眾贈醫施藥的診所，一步步發展成為今天跨區域、跨範疇的非政府福利機構，在港九新界營運超過100個服務單位，涵蓋社會福利、教育、醫療、康體等不同領域。這一切成就，全靠歷屆董事局成員、員工和義工團隊無私的付出與堅持。

​仁愛堂一直用心服務不同界別人士。在支援基層兒童方面，仁愛堂一直積極配合政府政策，支持兒童發展基金。自二○一二年起，仁愛堂已經在屬下學校及社福單位推出八個兒童發展基金計劃，累計惠及超過700名基層兒童。

​此外，仁愛堂亦於二○二三／二四學年起協助推行在校課後託管服務計劃，於兩間小學提供約100個名額，讓有需要的小學生在安全熟悉的校園環境，接受託管及學習支援，便利家長外出工作，令雙職及單親家庭受惠。

​在安老服務方面，仁愛堂更是特區政府的重要夥伴。除了透過長者中心舉辦多元化的社區活動、講座和提供支援服務，仁愛堂亦積極參與「長者社區照顧服務券計劃」，並全力支援「灣區養老」政策發展。

​其中，仁愛堂與多間內地醫療養老集團及院舍合作，以「院舍服務 + 跨境安老 + 港式養老」的創新模式，回應國家的粵港澳大灣區民生融合政策，為香港長者提供更多養老選擇。

​我很高興知道，仁愛堂今年會全力支援屯門青福里簡約公屋居民入伙；亦會支持香港中醫醫院與仁愛堂中醫診所暨教研中心的協作，包括服務發展、診症、培訓、研究和中醫推廣等，進一步推動中醫服務普及化，惠及廣大市民。

​仁愛堂服務範疇廣泛，實在不能在這裡一一盡錄。

​各位朋友，建設關愛共融的社會，是特區政府的施政重點。我們需要像仁愛堂這樣經驗豐富、扎根社區的夥伴，與政府同心協力，為市民提供更貼心、更到位的服務。特區政府將繼續與仁愛堂保持緊密合作，一起為香港的福祉努力。

何俊亨主席（仁愛堂主席）、各位董事局成員、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

​大家好！我很高興出席今晚的仁愛堂周年慈善餐舞會，與各位一同回顧仁愛堂努力耕耘的豐碩成果，同時為仁愛堂各項福利服務籌募善款，造福社會。

今年餐舞會以「綠野仙蹤」為主題，寓意只要懷抱勇氣、智慧與愛心，就可以陪伴弱勢社群跨越困難、走向美好。這份精神，正正與仁愛堂多年來的工作互相呼應，實在別具意義。​

​仁愛堂由最初一間為貧苦大眾贈醫施藥的診所，一步步發展成為今天跨區域、跨範疇的非政府福利機構，在港九新界營運超過100個服務單位，涵蓋社會福利、教育、醫療、康體等不同領域。這一切成就，全靠歷屆董事局成員、員工和義工團隊無私的付出與堅持。

​仁愛堂一直用心服務不同界別人士。在支援基層兒童方面，仁愛堂一直積極配合政府政策，支持兒童發展基金。自二○一二年起，仁愛堂已經在屬下學校及社福單位推出八個兒童發展基金計劃，累計惠及超過700名基層兒童。

​此外，仁愛堂亦於二○二三／二四學年起協助推行在校課後託管服務計劃，於兩間小學提供約100個名額，讓有需要的小學生在安全熟悉的校園環境，接受託管及學習支援，便利家長外出工作，令雙職及單親家庭受惠。

​在安老服務方面，仁愛堂更是特區政府的重要夥伴。除了透過長者中心舉辦多元化的社區活動、講座和提供支援服務，仁愛堂亦積極參與「長者社區照顧服務券計劃」，並全力支援「灣區養老」政策發展。

​其中，仁愛堂與多間內地醫療養老集團及院舍合作，以「院舍服務 + 跨境安老 + 港式養老」的創新模式，回應國家的粵港澳大灣區民生融合政策，為香港長者提供更多養老選擇。

​我很高興知道，仁愛堂今年會全力支援屯門青福里簡約公屋居民入伙；亦會支持香港中醫醫院與仁愛堂中醫診所暨教研中心的協作，包括服務發展、診症、培訓、研究和中醫推廣等，進一步推動中醫服務普及化，惠及廣大市民。

​仁愛堂服務範疇廣泛，實在不能在這裡一一盡錄。

​各位朋友，建設關愛共融的社會，是特區政府的施政重點。我們需要像仁愛堂這樣經驗豐富、扎根社區的夥伴，與政府同心協力，為市民提供更貼心、更到位的服務。特區政府將繼續與仁愛堂保持緊密合作，一起為香港的福祉努力。

​最後，我衷心祝願仁愛堂繼往開來，服務更上一層樓；也祝願在座各位身體健康、家庭幸福。多謝大家！"

兩名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2026-01-16 19:21,2026-01-16 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600710.htm,"兩名入境旅客因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（一月十六日）在粉嶺裁判法院分別被判處監禁兩個月及十星期。

海關人員昨日（一月十五日）在羅湖管制站截查一名三十七歲抵港女旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲四千四百零三支未完稅香煙，估計市值約一萬八千元，應課稅值約一萬五千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。她今日被判監禁兩個月。

Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2026-01-16 19:21,2026-01-16 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600707.htm,"Two incoming passengers were sentenced to two months' and 10 weeks' imprisonment respectively by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (January 16) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted a 37-year-old incoming female passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (January 15) and seized 4 403 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $18,000 and a duty potential of about $15,000, from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested. She was sentenced to two months' imprisonment today.

  On the same day, Customs officers intercepted a 23-year-old incoming male passenger at the same control point and seized 5 192 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $21,000 and a duty potential of about $17,000, from his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to 10 weeks' imprisonment today.

Customs welcomes the sentences, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentences have imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflect the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
Speech by SFST at Hong Kong Federation of Insurers Cocktail Party 2026: A Grateful Beginning in Unity (English only),2026-01-16 19:05,2026-01-16 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600669.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers (HKFI) Cocktail Party 2026: A Grateful Beginning in Unity today (January 16):

Ellick (Chairman of the HKFI, Mr Ellick Tsui), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and fellow colleagues in the insurance sector,

 Good evening. As we gather here tonight at the HKFI Cocktail Party 2026, I would like to begin by wishing each of you a happy, healthy, and prosperous New Year. May 2026 bring you renewed energy, meaningful achievements, and continued success in all that you do.

 Tonight's theme, ""A Grateful Beginning in Unity"", captures the spirit of collaboration and shared purpose that has always defined our industry. Hong Kong remains one of the world's most open and dynamic insurance centres. We are currently home to around 160 authorised insurers, which 95 incorporated locally, with 65 from the Mainland and over 20 overseas jurisdictions. Remarkably, six of the world's top 10 insurers are authorised to operate here. This strong international presence reaffirms Hong Kong's position as a premier hub for insurance and risk management.

 Supported by the National 14th Five-Year Plan, we are actively strengthening our roles as an international financial centre and a global risk management centre within the ""dual circulation"" framework. As a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", Hong Kong serves as a vital two-way bridge on helping Mainland enterprises go global while attracting overseas firms to establish and grow their presence here.

 I'm delighted to share some exciting recent developments. Hong Kong now hosts six captive insurers, with two new ones established last year alone. This steady growth highlights the strong and sustained appeal of our city for captive solutions. We will continue to proactively invite Mainland and international enterprises to set up captives here, further enhancing our risk management ecosystem.

 Another significant milestone came in November last year with the establishment of an independent, commercial marine specialty risk pool. From early 2026, this pool will provide dedicated coverage for Hong Kong and Mainland vessels. It strengthens contingency protection for shipowners, unlocks new business opportunities under the Belt and Road Initiative, drives growth in our maritime and insurance sectors, and solidifies Hong Kong's status as a leading international financial and shipping centre.

 Ladies and gentlemen, these achievements are the fruit of our collective dedication and unity.

 Before I close, I must express my deep appreciation for the industry's outstanding response to the recent tragic Tai Po fire incident. All of you acted swiftly, activating claims processes and relief measures without delay, so that every affected family received timely and comprehensive support. Your actions not only eased immense hardship but also powerfully demonstrated the professionalism, solidarity, and profound social responsibility that define our sector.

 As we look to the year ahead, let us build on this grateful beginning: continuing to innovate, serve our community, and elevate Hong Kong as Asia's and the world's premier insurance and risk management hub.

 I wish you all a wonderful evening filled with meaningful connections and renewed inspiration. Thank you."
​兩名男子違規轉讓康體設施被判社會服務令,2026-01-16 18:46,2026-01-16 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600685.htm,"兩名男子涉及違規轉讓康體設施，分別被控一項「使用他人身份證」和「將身份證轉讓給他人」罪名，兩人早前承認控罪，今日（一月十六日）在沙田裁判法院分別被判處80小時社會服務令。其中一人為原租用場地人士，早前已被康樂及文化事務署（康文署）暫停預訂康體設施的資格360日。

康文署聯同執法部門於二○二四年七月十三日在維多利亞公園網球場採取聯合行動，打擊違規轉讓康體設施及其他違法行為。行動中拘捕了一名男子，涉嫌在無合理辯解下使用及管有他人身份證。及後，與案件相關的另一名男子被控一項「將身份證轉讓給他人」罪名。

康文署呼籲市民切勿違規轉讓康體設施、光顧代訂康體設施服務、使用他人身份證簽場及將自己的身份證明交予他人代簽場，以免違反康文署「康樂及體育設施使用條件」（使用條件）及觸犯法例。違反使用條件者可被暫停預訂康體設施的資格，為期360日。

此外，「SmartPLAY康體通」已加入了禁止使用電腦程式或其他自動化工具預訂場地的條件。由二○二六年一月二十一日起，如用戶違反有關條件，康文署會暫停其帳戶360日，無須給予任何預先通知。康文署再次提醒用戶必須遵守「SmartPLAY康體通」的使用條件，妥善管理SmartPLAY帳戶資料，切勿向他人透露用戶帳號及密碼；曾將SmartPLAY帳號及密碼提供予第三者的用戶，請盡快及定期更新用戶密碼，以免帳戶被盜用。

康文署會繼續打擊康樂場地的違規轉讓或炒賣，於有需要時會繼續優化「SmartPLAY康體通」，以及推出更多打擊「炒場」的措施。"
Two men involved in unauthorised transfer of bookings of recreation and sports facilities sentenced to community service orders,2026-01-16 18:46,2026-01-16 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/16/P2026011600683.htm,"  Two men involved in the unauthorised transfer of bookings of recreation and sports facilities, charged with ""using an identity card relating to another person"" and ""transferring an identity card to another person"" and having pleaded guilty to the charges earlier, were sentenced to community service orders of 80 hours respectively at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts today (January 16). One of them was the original hirer, and his booking right for the use of recreation and sports facilities had already been suspended by theLeisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) for 360 days.

  The LCSD conducted a joint operation with law enforcement agencies at the tennis courts in Victoria Park on July 13, 2024, to combat unauthorised transfer of bookings of recreation and sports facilities and other illegal activities. During the operation, one man suspected of using and possessing another person's identity card without reasonable excuse was arrested. Another man involved was subsequently charged with ""transferring an identity card to another person"".

  The LCSD appeals to the public not to engage in any unauthorised transfer of bookings of recreation and sports facilities. Users should not pay scalpers for facility bookings, use another person's identity card, or lend their own identification documents to another person for check-in to use facilities. Users breaching the LCSD's ""General Conditions of Use of Leisure and Sports Facilities"" or the law will have their rights for booking recreation and sports facilities suspended for 360 days.

  SmartPLAY has already incorporated conditions prohibiting the use of computer programmes or other automated tools to make bookings. Starting from January 21, 2026, if users breach the said conditions, the LCSD will immediately suspend their accounts for 360 days without giving any prior notice. The LCSD once again reminds users of the necessity of complying with the ""Conditions of Use of SmartPLAY"", properly managing the information of their SmartPLAY accounts, and not disclosing their user account numbers and passwords to others. Users having provided their user account numbers and passwords to a third party are advised to change their passwords as soon as possible and regularly to prevent unauthorised use of their accounts.

  The LCSD will continue to combat unauthorised transfer and touting of leisure venues and enhance SmartPLAY, as well as implement further anti-touting measures as necessary."
