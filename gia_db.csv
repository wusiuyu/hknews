尊敬的周霽主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任）、董經緯署長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署署長）、崔建春特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署特派員）、譚志偉副司令員（中國人民解放軍駐香港部隊副司令員）、李大宏董事長（香港大公文匯傳媒集團董事長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好。今天開幕的「紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年」大型巡迴展覽，有助我們銘記歷史、珍愛和平。我首先恭賀展覽順利舉行。

中國人民抗日戰爭，是中華民族團結共抗外敵持續時間最長、規模最大、犧牲最多的戰爭，全國人民以巨大民族犧牲，支撐起世界反法西斯戰爭的東方主戰場，為世界反法西斯戰爭勝利作出了貢獻。抗戰勝利，是中華民族團結奮進，邁向偉大復興的轉捩點。

八十載崢嶸歲月，八十載砥礪奮進。中華兒女不屈不撓的偉大抗戰精神，在八十年後的今天，仍然刻骨銘心。先烈以偉大犧牲保家衞國、堅守民族尊嚴，是今天國家繁榮昌盛的基石，是今天人民安居樂業的起點。

這次展覽由大公文匯傳媒集團主辦，並由內地和香港多個政府單位和抗戰組織支持和協辦，在香港會議展覽中心展出後，會在香港18區和學校進行巡展。我期望香港市民通過展覽，和特區政府與各民間團體舉辦的抗戰勝利80周年紀念活動，更全面、更立體地認識這段中華民族不能磨滅的共同記憶，這段歷史提醒我們很多人生意義。

第一，眾志成城，團結無懼艱苦的磅礡偉力。在長達14年的漫長抗戰中，面對山河淪喪、民族被踐踏，全國人民在抗日民族統一戰線下，不分你我、不分地域，全面投身抗日活動。這些人和你我一樣，從事不同的工作、有着不同的背景、處於不同的年齡。他們都懷着一顆愛國的心，在各自崗位發揮自己力量，共同支援祖國抗日。

前人的經歷啓示我們，團結合力的民族意志和愛國精神，可以以弱勝強，成功捍衞祖國的河山、民族的尊嚴，洗刷多年外侮屈辱。中華兒女在抗戰上，向世界展示了天下興亡、匹夫有責的愛國情懷和民族氣節，激勵我們自強不息、乘風破浪、奮勇前行。

第二，居安思危，築牢珍愛和平的金城湯池。80年後的今天，中華民族偉大復興道路不可逆轉。但我們必須認識清楚侵略主義、霸權主義未有真正停止，這一刻的世界，仍有很多平民深陷戰火，使人聞者心傷。

抗戰的悲壯啓示我們，在國家前進的道路上，會面對各種風險和挑戰，敵對勢力不時蠢蠢欲動，妄圖阻攔國家和平發展。我們必須時刻牢記歷史，警惕美化侵略的言論，自覺維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，以偉大抗戰精神展示的決心和勇氣，為和平構建人類命運共同體，堅持不懈奮鬥。

第三，薪火相傳，永續民族復興的歷史使命。在這場艱苦卓絕的抗爭中，香港民眾與全國同胞血脈相連，從營救文化人士、奔赴抗戰前線，到籌集運送物資、宣傳抗日信息等，香港從未缺位，一直與祖國患難與共、並肩作戰。

歷史教訓我們，要以史為鑑，珍愛和平、堅持和平，撫今追昔，珍惜先烈以鮮血換來的和平、堅定站在正義的一方。我希望大家珍惜展覽和一系列抗戰勝利80周年活動的難得機會，學習前人為民族、為國家貢獻的力量，向家人和朋友分享你們的體會，把抗戰精神代代相傳。

前事不忘，後事之師。我們必須銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平，不負先輩的犧牲和他們對和平和國家強盛的渴望，為中華民族、為世界開創更輝煌的未來。

我祝願展覽圓滿成功，在座各位平安健康、生活美滿。謝謝大家。"

為個人、家人及他人健康着想，政府呼籲吸煙人士盡快戒煙。市民可致電衞生署綜合戒煙熱線1833 183。熱線由註冊護士接聽，為吸煙人士提供專業戒煙輔導。"
房屋局就「簡約公屋」營運及管理服務合約招標（附圖）,2025-08-22 11:00,2025-08-22 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200223.htm,"​房屋局今日（八月二十二日）就「簡約公屋」項目的第九及第十份營運及管理服務合約進行招標，並鼓勵有能力和經驗的機構積極參與。

兩份合約均涉及屯門欣寶路（即屯門第54區）「簡約公屋」項目，分別負責營運及管理各約2 800個單位。整個屯門欣寶路項目共提供約5 600個單位，預計明年第三季落成。

房屋局發言人表示：「由於屯門欣寶路項目規模較大，我們將項目分拆兩份合約進行招標，讓更多有經驗、有抱負的不同機構有機會參與營運管理。」

與之前批出的合約一樣，「簡約公屋」的營運及管理服務除包括住戶事務管理、物業管理、日常保養維修，亦涵蓋社會服務，以及管理和營運一系列配套設施等範疇。為推動社會上不同持份者的參與，房屋局歡迎有能力和經驗的服務承辦商投標，包括非政府機構及持有物業管理公司牌照的機構，或是兩者合作。

為確保服務質素，房屋局會根據投標機構的管理能力、相關經驗、過往的服務表現，以及其計劃書內建議的營運和管理模式、提供的社會服務、遷出計劃的可行性、創新和資訊科技的應用等一系列因素作出技術評審，務求令「簡約公屋」的設施和服務切合居民和地區需要，再就投標價格作出綜合評審，選出最合適的機構負責營運「簡約公屋」。

房屋局至今已批出四份「簡約公屋」營運及管理服務合約，涵蓋元朗攸壆路、牛頭角彩興路及彩石里（即前聖若瑟英文中學）、屯門青福里（即屯門第3A區），以及第一期啟德世運道項目。另外，房屋局正在評審第五及第六份營運及管理服務合約的投標書，分別涉及四個改裝校舍項目，以及柴灣常安街項目。房屋局亦正為第七及第八份營運及管理服務合約招標，兩份合約均涉及第二期啟德世運道「簡約公屋」項目。

發言人說：「位於元朗攸壆路約2 100個『簡約公屋』單位已在今年六月中全面入伙，而作為第二個落成及首個位於市區的彩興路『簡約公屋』項目約2 290個單位亦預期快將完成入伙，充分反映租金便宜、配套服務齊全、居住環境更好的『簡約公屋』項目，相當受有需要的市民歡迎。房屋局剛公布二○二五年第二季公屋綜合輪候時間，一般申請者的綜合輪候時間下降0.2年至5.1年，是二○一八年第一季以來的最低位；而當中『簡約公屋』的一般申請者的輪候時間平均為2.3年，可見『簡約公屋』能快速回應急需改善居住環境家庭的需要。此外，約七成彩興路『簡約公屋』的住戶原先居住在不適切住房，例如『劏房』、天台屋和床位等，他們入住『簡約公屋』後生活即時得以大幅改善。」

有興趣投標的機構可透過房屋局網頁（www.hb.gov.hk）內相關的招標公告或進入「電子投標系統」下載招標文件，或聯絡房屋局轄下的「簡約公屋」專責小組索取招標文件，招標編號分別為HB2025/OPR-LPH-YNP1及HB2025/OPR-LPH-YNP2。

投標者須於二○二五年十月十日（星期五）中午十二時前透過「電子投標系統」提交電子投標書，或把投標書放入添馬添美道2號政府總部東翼地下公眾入口大堂的「政府總部投標箱」內遞交。逾期的投標概不受理。"

Vacancy in Yuen Long District Council,2025-08-22 11:00,2025-08-22 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082100291.htm,"The Government declared by notice in the Gazette today (August 22) the existence of a vacant ex officio member seat in the Yuen Long District Council.

The ex officio member, Mr Kwok Wing-cheong, passed away on August 2, 2025. Pursuant to section 19A(1)(a) of the District Councils Ordinance (Cap. 547), his office has become vacant."
Tenders for operation and management contracts of Light Public Housing invited (with photo),2025-08-22 11:00,2025-08-22 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200225.htm,"âThe Housing Bureau (HB) today (August 22) invites tenders for the ninth and 10th operation and management contracts of Light Public Housing (LPH), and encourages capable and experienced organisations to participate.

The two contracts, relating to the LPH project at Yan Po Road, Tuen Mun (i.e. Tuen Mun Area 54), are for the operation and management of about 2 800 units each. The entire LPH project at Yan Po Road, Tuen Mun, will provide about 5 600 units in total and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of next year.

A spokesperson for the HB said, ""Taking into account that the LPH project at Yan Po Road, Tuen Mun, is relatively larger in scale, it is divided into two separate contracts so as to encourage participation from different experienced and aspirational organisations.""

  As with the contracts already awarded, the operation and management services for the LPH not only cover occupant management, property management and daily maintenance, but also the provision of social services, as well as the management and operation of ancillary facilities, etc. To encourage participation of different stakeholders in the community, the HB welcomes tenders from all capable and experienced service providers, including non-government organisations and those with a valid property management company licence, or collaborations between them.

To ensure service quality, the HB will carry out technical assessments based on a series of factors, including the management capability, relevant experience and past service performance of the organisations, as well as the proposed modes of operation and management, social services to be provided, feasibility of exit plan and use of innovation and information technology as stated in their proposals, so that the facilities and services of the LPH can meet the needs of the residents and the local community. The tender price will then be evaluated to form a consolidated assessment to decide on the most suitable organisation for operating the LPH.

The HB has so far awarded four LPH operation and management contracts, covering the projects at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long; Choi Hing Road and Choi Shek Lane (i.e. the former St Joseph's Anglo-Chinese School), Ngau Tau Kok; Tsing Fuk Lane, Tuen Mun (i.e. Tuen Mun Area 3A); and Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 1). Separately, the HB is now evaluating tenders for the fifth and sixth operation and management contracts covering the four school conversion projects and the LPH project at Sheung On Street, Chai Wan, respectively. Tenders for the seventh and eighth operation and management contracts, both covering Phase 2 of the LPH project at Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak, are being invited.

The spokesperson said, ""The tenant intake for the first LPH project at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long, providing about 2 100 units, was fully completed in mid-June this year. The second LPH project at Choi Hing Road, which provides about 2 290 units, is the first project in an urban area with full intake expected to complete soon. This fully demonstrates that with affordable rent, comprehensive facilities and services, as well as a better living environment, LPH projects are highly popular among residents in need. The HB just announced the Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing (CWT) for the second quarter of 2025. The CWT for general applicants has decreased by 0.2 years to 5.1 years, which is the lowest since the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, the waiting time for general applicants of LPH is 2.3 years on average, showing that LPH can quickly address the urgent demand for improving living conditions of households in need. Moreover, about 70 per cent of the residents at Choi Hing Road LPH had previously resided in inadequate housing, such as sub-divided units, rooftop houses and bedspaces. Their livelihood has been greatly improved right after moving into LPH.""

Interested organisations may download the tender documents via the relevant tender notices on the HB's website (www.hb.gov.hk) or from the e-Tendering System; or contact the Dedicated Team on Light Public Housing under the HB for obtaining the tender documents. The Tender References are HB2025/OPR-LPH-YNP1 and HB2025/OPR-LPH-YNP2 respectively.

Tenderers must submit the tenders by noon on October 10, 2025 (Friday), either electronically via the e-Tendering System or by deposit in the Government Secretariat Tender Box situated at the Lobby of the Public Entrance on the Ground Floor, East Wing, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar. Late tenders will not be accepted."
Proposed installation works of Asia Link Cable - Hong Kong Bundle (ALC-HK Cable Bundle) Submarine Cable System gazetted,2025-08-22 11:00,2025-08-22 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200262.htm,"The Government proposes to allow China Telecom Global Limited to install the Asia Link Cable - Hong Kong Bundle (ALC-HK Cable Bundle) Submarine Cable System within an area of approximately 1.84 hectares of foreshore and seabed from Chung Hom Kok to the eastern boundary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

"DH's enforcement operation ""Laserflame"" against illegal smoking in statutory no smoking areas of public transport facilities and Announcement of extension of statutory no smoking areas in public transport facilities",2025-08-22 11:00,2025-08-22 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200242.htm,"The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health (DH) will conduct an enforcement operation codenamed ""Laserflame"" between next Monday (August 25) and August 30 against illegal smoking in statutory no smoking areas of public transport facilities across the territory. Officers will also publicise the relevant smoking ban regulations to members of the public.

From January 2021 to June 2025, TACO has conducted over 19 400 inspections at public transport facilities regarding smoking offences, and issued more than 9 400 fixed penalty notices/summons.

The DH also reminded the public that, effective from August 31, 10 public transport facilities (PTFs) will be newly designated as no smoking areas (NSAs), and one PTF's NSA will be revised under the Smoking (Public Health) (Designation of No Smoking Areas) (Amendment) Notice 2025.

The 10 PTFs newly designated as NSAs are:
1. Chai Wan (East) Temporary Bus Terminus;
2. Exhibition Centre Station Public Transport Interchange, Wan Chai;
3. Wong Chuk Hang Station Public Transport Facilities;
4. Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port Public Transport Interchange;
5. Kwai Tsui Estate Public Transport Interchange, Kwai Chung;
6. Pak Tam Chung Bus Terminus, Sai Kung;
7. Tuen Mun Central Bus Terminus;
8. Tung Chung Development Pier Bus Terminus;
9. Yau Oi (South) Bus Terminus, Tuen Mun (temporarily closed); and
10. Yuen Long (Tak Yip Street) Bus Terminus.

The one PTF with revised NSA is Central Ferry Piers Public Transport Interchange.

To protect public health, it is the established policy of the Government to discourage smoking, contain the proliferation of tobacco use and protect the public from second-hand smoke. The Notice was gazetted on May 30 this year and will take effect on August 31, expanding the smoking ban to 272 PTFs throughout the territory.

No-smoking signs and layout plans are put up, and demarcation lines are displayed to clearly indicate the boundaries with regard to the respective physical settings at the NSAs to remind the public of the smoke-free requirements. Plans showing the boundaries of the NSAs are available in the Land Registry, and will be uploaded to the TACO's website for public inspection.

Any person who does a smoking act in NSAs or in public transport carriers will be liable for a fixed penalty of $1,500. Tobacco and Alcohol Control Inspectors will prosecute smoking offenders without prior warning.

For the sake of the health of individuals, their families and others, the Government appeals to smokers to quit smoking as early as possible. Members of the public may call the DH's Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline on 1833 183, which is operated by registered nurses to provide professional counselling services on smoking cessation."

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-22 06:45,2025-08-22 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200123.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 22) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

倫敦經貿辦處長周雪梅於八月二十日（愛丁堡時間）兩場演出開始前向觀眾致辭，強調香港在國家《十四五規劃綱要》的支持下致力進一步提升作為中外文化藝術交流中心的地位。

周雪梅表示：「香港特別行政區政府一直積極培育本地藝術人才，並拓展國際發展機遇。同時，政府一直投放資源在世界級藝術基建，包括全新啟德體育園五萬座位的主場館，以及於二○二四年成功舉辦首屆香港演藝博覽，吸引世界各地藝術家及文化機構參與。」

周雪梅指出，香港與愛丁堡近年在文化及商貿領域聯繫日益緊密，她歡迎愛丁堡企業探索香港多元化的商機。她以去年香港實施雙層烈酒稅制為例說明香港便利營商的策略，此舉進一步推動香港成為高端酒類貿易及拍賣中心，並帶動物流、旅遊及高端餐飲等高增值行業的發展，這些發展為愛丁堡與香港之間更廣泛的合作開啟大門。

愛丁堡藝穗節於八月一日至二十五日在英國愛丁堡舉行，上演其中三個香港節目包括：一桌兩椅慈善基金會演出的《粵劇x兒童互動劇場：的的撐撐遊樂園》、「一舖清唱」的《石堅》無伴奏音樂劇場歷險，以及由萬幸聯同兩位英國音樂家Eleanor Dunsdon和Gregor Black帶來中國與蘇格蘭音樂交流表演（Waves of Tradition: A New Horizon in Scottish-Chinese Music）。三個節目不但展現香港多元文化底蘊，亦進一步鞏固香港作為國際文化交流平台的地位。"
Hong Kong performers bring East-meets-West creativity to Edinburgh Festival Fringe (with photos),2025-08-22 00:06,2025-08-22 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082100928.htm," The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, London (London ETO) supported three Hong Kong performance programmes at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2025, highlighting the city's vibrant arts scene. The performances featured the One Table Two Chairs Charitable Foundation, zheng musician Wan Xing and a cappella group Yat Po Singers.

 The Director-General of the London ETO, Miss Fiona Chau, addressed the audience before two performances staged on August 20 (Edinburgh time). She highlighted Hong Kong's vision of further enhancing its role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, as supported by the National 14th Five-Year Plan.

 ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is firmly committed to nurturing home-grown talent and expanding global opportunities for our artists. We are investing in world-class arts infrastructure, such as the new 50 000-seat stadium at the Kai Tak Sports Park, and have launched flagship events such as the inaugural Hong Kong Performing Arts Expo in 2024, which gathered leading artists and institutions from around the world,"" Miss Chau remarked.

 Noting the growing connections between Hong Kong and Edinburgh, particularly in the cultural and business sectors, Miss Chau welcomed Edinburgh enterprises to explore the diverse business opportunities that Hong Kong has to offer. She highlighted the introduction of a two-tier liquor duty system in Hong Kong last year as an example of the city's strategy to facilitate business. This initiative has encouraged the trade and auctions of high-end liquor in Hong Kong, thereby giving impetus to the development of other high value-added sectors such as logistics and storage, tourism, as well as high-end food and beverage consumption. These developments open the door for even broader collaboration between Edinburgh and Hong Kong.

 Running from August 1 to 25 in Edinburgh, the United Kingdom (UK), the Festival showcased three Hong Kong programmes: ""Cantonese Opera x Children's Interactive Theatre: Dic Dic Chang Chang Playground"" by One Table Two Chairs Charitable Foundation; ""Rock Hard – A Theatrical A Cappella Adventure"" by Yat Po Singers; and ""Waves of Tradition: A New Horizon in Scottish-Chinese Music"" by Wan and two UK musicians, Eleanor Dunsdon and Gregor Black. These performances underscored Hong Kong's vibrant cultural contributions and its role in international cultural exchanges."
Protecting children's vision health has been a long-standing commitment for DH,2025-08-21 20:50,2025-08-21 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100784.htm,"In response to media reports on the visual health of children in Hong Kong, the Department of Health (DH) today (August 21) gave the following response:

""The DH has been safeguarding the physical and psychosocial health of children, including their vision, through health promotion and disease prevention services. One of the major initiatives is to provide regular free assessment services for children in Hong Kong at different stages of their development through the Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) and the Student Health Service (SHS) Centres of the DH. These services enable the early identification of children with visual acuity problems, allowing for the timely provision of advice and intervention, including referrals to appropriate institutions for further assessment or treatment.

Pre-school children

The MCHCs of the DH offer free Pre-School Vision Screening for children aged four to five, aiming to identify those with visual problems, such as amblyopia, squint or significant refractive errors, as early as possible. When necessary, children are referred to ophthalmologists for further visual assessment and treatment to safeguard their vision and visual development. Last year (2024), more than 23 600 children, which were new cases, participated in the Pre-School Vision Screening. Among them, 15 per cent were referred to ophthalmologists for follow-up.

Primary school children

The visual acuity tests provided by the SHS are screening tests. Students will be arranged to undergo the screening service every year regardless of whether they wear glasses. The test aims to detect as early as possible visual acuity problems of the students, and whether the problems so detected have already been appropriately corrected, including wearing suitable glasses.

Those who fail the visual acuity test will be referred to optometrists of the DH's Special Assessment Service for further visual assessment. Parents of the students may also choose to consult private optometrists for assessments and follow-ups.In addition, the SHS will provide a stereoscopic vision test to Primary One students (or those at their first visit) toidentify other visual problems, including amblyopia and squint, for follow-up.

In the 2023/24 school year, around 257 000 primary school students (i.e. about 80 per cent of primary school students in Hong Kong) received free annual health assessment services, including visual acuity tests. Among them, 35.1 per cent of students wore glasses. Upon assessment, it was found that nearly 20 per cent (over 50 000 persons),who failed preliminary visual acuity test or had other eye or visual problems, required further assessment by optometrists in the SHS or private sector. Among these, about 33 000 primary students had never worn glasses.

The DH recommends primary school children aged between six and 12 years old to limit recreational screen time to less than two hours a day. The health assessment questionnaire revealed that 43.3 per cent of primary school students indicated that they spent two or more hours in using Internet or electronic screen products (including computers, tablets, smartphones, video games and television) for recreational purposes on a typical school day. The proportion was higher than in the pre-COVID years of around 30 per cent, which is a cause for concern.

Apart from reminding students of the appropriate recreational screen time, the DH has set up a webpage onHealthy Use of Internet and Electronic Screen Productsto assist parents and teachers in handling related issues.

The DH reminds students to adopt the following health tips to protect their vision when using electronic screen products:

Use proper lighting and reduce glare on the device screen;
Keep a proper distance and posture for screen viewing;

CFS urges public not to consume two kinds of French cheese suspected to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,2025-08-21 20:30,2025-08-21 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100783.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (August 21) urged the public not to consume two kinds of cheese originated from France due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The trade should stop using or selling the affected products immediately if they possess any of them.

  The product details are as follows:

Product name: Mon Ami Petit Camembert
Place of origin: France
Pack size: 125 grams
Lot numbers / use-by dates / importers:
(1) C4314092 / November 8, 2025 / JJ Global Sourcing Limited;

Place of origin: France
Pack size: 125 grams
Batch number / use-by date / importer:
(1) C5084093 / March 24, 2026 / Classic Fine Foods (Hong Kong) Limited

  ""The CFS received a notification from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the European Commission that the above-mentioned products are being recalled due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately contacted local importers to follow up. A preliminary investigation found that the above-mentioned importers had imported into Hong Kong the affected batches of the products concerned,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

  The importers concerned have stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected batches of the products and have initiated recalls according to the CFS's instructions. Enquiries can be made to the respective importers' hotlines during office hours. They are: JJ Global Sourcing Limited (Tel: 2190 2125) and Classic Fine Foods (Hong Kong) Limited (Tel: 3145 7819).

  ""Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicaemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in newborns,"" the spokesman added.

  ""In order to reduce the risk of listeriosis, susceptible populations such as pregnant women should consume freshly prepared hot food where possible, reheat chilled food until it is hot all the way through, and avoid high-risk foods, including ready-to-eat food such as cold cuts, cold smoked seafood, soft cheeses, salads, etc, or cook them thoroughly before consumption, even if they are presented as part of a dish.""

  The spokesman advised members of the public to stop consuming the affected products and seek medical treatment if they feel unwell after consuming the products concerned.

  The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."
DH urges public to work together to step up mosquito control and prevention measures amid global spread of mosquito-borne diseases,2025-08-21 20:12,2025-08-21 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100768.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that, as of 5pm today (August 21), no new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

""Although there have been no new imported cases of CF in the past six consecutive days, high temperatures and rainfall levels continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world. Members of the public must remain vigilant and take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have travel history,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

""As the new school year is about to begin, the CHP also urges educational institutions to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. Through the Education Bureau, the CHP will once again remind schools, staff and students to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus. While mosquito-borne diseases are not transmitted from person to person, but it requires the collective effort of the entire community to eliminate mosquito breeding sites in order to effectively prevent such diseases and protect one's own health and one's family members,"" Dr Tsui added.

The following is the latest situation and relevant health information on major mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and worldwide:

1. CF

Hong Kong has recorded nine imported CF cases this year, involving six males and three females aged between 8 and 79 years. Five cases involved individuals who had travelled to Foshan in Guangdong Province during the incubation periods, while four involved individuals who had travelled to Bangladesh. Three patients developed symptoms before returning to Hong Kong and the remaining six patients developed symptoms between the first and the fifth day after returning. Regarding symptoms, all patients experienced fever, and the vast majority (eight cases) reported joint pain, which typically appeared on the same day or the day after the onset of fever. The most commonly affected body parts were the wrists, elbows, knees and ankles.

The public should be aware that, in addition to Foshan in Guangdong Province, many countries worldwide are currently experiencing outbreaks of CF. Before travelling aboard, it is essential to pay attention to the situation of the destinations, and take mosquito prevention and personal protection measures. After returning to Hong Kong from affected areas, it is also necessary to continue monitoring one's health condition.

2. Dengue Fever (DF)

No DF cases were recorded in Hong Kong between August 15 and 20. There have been 41 imported DF cases recorded so far this year. Although the figure is slightly lower than the same period last year, the DF situation remains severe in Hong Kong's neighbouring regions and worldwide. Hence, the risk of continual occurrence of imported cases is still high.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades. In 2024, over 14 million cases were recorded, setting a new record high. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases. Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 586 locally infected cases so far this year, with relatively more cases in Guangzhou, Foshan, Chaozhou and Shenzhen.

DF is also transmitted to humans through the bite of female Aedes mosquitoes carrying the DF virus. Symptoms are similar to those of CF, including high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. The incubation period is usually four to seven days. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe form of DF with increased bleeding tendency; the mortality rate can be as high as 20 per cent. Patients who have a second infection with a different serotype of DF virus are more likely to result in DHF.

3. Japanese encephalitis (JE)

The CHP yesterday announced an imported case of JE, marking the first such case recorded in Hong Kong since 2020. The primary vector of JE is the Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Mosquitoes breed in areas where there is a lot of stagnant water, such as rice paddies, and become infected when they bite pigs or wild birds infected with the JE virus. The infected mosquitoes then transmit the virus to humans and animals during biting. JE is prevalent in rural areas of Asia and the Western Pacific Region, especially in hot season. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission can occur year-round, often with a peak during the rainy season.

The incubation period from infection to onset of symptoms is four to 14 days. Most patients with JE have mild symptoms, with no significant symptoms other than fever and headache. However, approximately one in every 250 infections is associated with severe illnesses characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.

4. Zika virus

No infection case of Zika virus had been recorded in Hong Kong this year. However, there were two and three imported cases recorded in 2023 and 2024 respectively, involving patients who had visited India and Thailand during incubation period. Surveillance data revealed that a relatively higher number of infection case of Zika virus have been recorded in the Southeast Asia, India and the Americas.

Aedes aegypti, which is the primary vector for Zika virus, is currently not found in Hong Kong, but other Aedes mosquito species (such as Aedes albopictus) are also considered as potential vectors. Symptoms of Zika including rash, fever, conjunctivitis, headache, muscle and joint pain, but most people infected with Zika Virus are asymptomatic. Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other congenital malformations in infants. Thus, pregnant women should pay close attention to the infection risk and adopt precautions against mosquito-borne diseases if they travel to affected areas.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on mosquito-borne diseases prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Besides, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of the mosquito-borne diseases.

Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent mosquito-borne diseases. Aedes albopictus, which is the vector for CF, DF and Zika virus, is common in Hong Kong, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus, the primary vector for JE, can also be found in Hong Kong. Members of the public should maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong.

Members of the public returning to Hong Kong from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should continue to apply insect repellent and monitor their personal health condition. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical attention immediately and inform their doctors of their travel history. The public should avoid using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), to prevent aggravating the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication.

衞生署一直致力保護兒童視力健康,2025-08-21 18:42,2025-08-21 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100694.htm,"就傳媒報道本港兒童視力健康情況，衞生署今日（八月二十一日）作以下回應：

衞生署一直透過促進健康及預防疾病服務，保障兒童身心健康，包括視力。其中一項主要措施，是透過衞生署母嬰健康院和學生健康服務中心為全港兒童在其不同階段持續提供免費的檢查服務，以及早識別有視力問題的學生，為他們適時提供意見和介入服務，包括轉介他們到合適的機構作進一步評估或處理。

學前兒童

衞生署母嬰健康院為四至五歲學前兒童提供免費的「學前兒童視力普查」服務，以便及早發現有弱視、斜視或嚴重的屈光等問題的兒童，有需要時會轉介他們到眼科專科醫生作進一步的視力評估及治療，保障兒童的視力及視覺發展。去年（二○二四年），參加「學前兒童視力普查」的兒童新症數目有超過23 600人，當中15%獲轉介至眼科專科跟進。

小學兒童

學生健康服務提供的視力測試為一項篩查檢測，不論學童有沒有配戴眼鏡，亦會獲安排每年接受篩查服務，以及早發現學生的視力問題，同時評估相關視力問題是否得到適當矯正，包括配戴合適的眼鏡。

未能通過視力測試的學生，會獲轉介到衞生署轄下健康評估服務的視光師作進一步視力評估。學生家長亦可選擇私人執業視光師為其子女作評估及跟進。此外，學生健康服務亦會為到訪的小一學生（或首次到訪的學生）提供立體視覺測試以了解學生有否其他視覺問題，包括弱視及斜視，並作出跟進。

 在二○二三／二四學年，約257 000名小學生（即全港近八成的小學生）接受免費周年健康檢查服務，包括視力測試。當中，配戴眼鏡的比例為35.1%。經檢查後發現，近20%（超過五萬人）未能通過初步視力測試、其他眼睛或視力問題，需要接受學生健康服務或私家的視光師進一步評估，其中包括約3.3萬小學生是一直沒有配戴眼鏡。

衞生署建議限制六至十二歲的小學兒童每天花少於兩小時使用電子屏幕產品作娛樂用途。根據健康評估問卷所得的資料顯示，43.3%小學生表示在一般上課日，花兩個小時或以上使用互聯網或電子屏幕產品（包括電腦、平板電腦、智能手機、視頻遊戲和電視）作娛樂用途，比例較新冠疫情前約30%為高，情況令人關注。

除了提醒學生使用電子屏幕產品的適當時間外，衞生署亦已設立「健康使用互聯網及電子屏幕產品」網頁，協助家長及教師處理相關問題。

衞生署提醒學生注意以下事項，以在使用電子屏幕產品時保護視力：


使用合適的照明並減低屏幕的光度；
觀看屏幕時，應與屏幕保持合適距離並維持良好姿勢；
適時休息：遵守20-20-20護眼守則（每20分鐘，遠望最少20呎外景物作20秒休息）；
遵守30-40-50原則：閱讀時，眼睛與電腦距離最少50厘米，與平板電腦距離最少40厘米，與智能電話距離最少30厘米；
多眨眼；及
定期檢查眼睛及保持良好觀看習慣。


二○二五／二六學年的周年健康檢查服務將於九月初透過學校接受報名。衞生署會繼續為本港兒童提供視力篩查及適當的轉介，並配合相關的健康促進活動，保障學生的視力及眼睛健康。"

蚊傳疾病全球肆虐　衞生署呼籲市民合力加強防蚊控蚊措施,2025-08-21 18:00,2025-08-21 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100654.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月二十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然本港已連續六天沒有新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，但溫度及雨量處於高水平，令多種蚊傳疾病在香港，以至全球爆發的風險持續。市民不能掉以輕心，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，應立即求醫，並通知醫生有否旅遊史。」

他續說：「由於新學年即將開始，中心亦呼籲辦學團體按照食物環境衞生署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方。中心會再次透過教育局提醒學校、教職員及學生防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。蚊傳疾病不會人傳人，但需要全城同心杜絕蚊患，方能有效預防，保障自己和家人健康。」

以下是主要蚊傳疾病在本港及全球的最新情況和相關健康資訊：

（一）基孔肯雅熱

本港今年累計錄得九宗輸入個案，涉及六男三女，年齡介乎8至79歲。五宗病例在潛伏期內曾前往廣東省佛山市，四宗病例則曾前往孟加拉國。三名病人在返港前已發病，另外六名病人在返港後的第一至五天發病。病徵方面，所有輸入個案病人均出現發燒，絕大部分（八宗）病例出現關節疼痛，通常在發燒開始的當天或一天後出現。最常受影響的部位包括手腕、肘部、膝蓋和腳踝。

市民應留意現時除廣東省佛山外，全球多國亦正爆發基孔肯雅熱疫情，外遊前必須注意當地情況，並採取防蚊和個人保護措施，從受影響地區返港後亦需繼續觀察身體狀況。

（二）登革熱

本港於八月十五日至二十日沒有錄得新增登革熱個案，今年暫時錄得41宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。數字雖然較去年同期略低，但香港鄰近地區及全球登革熱情況嚴峻，再錄得輸入個案的風險仍然相當高。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，去年（二○二四年）更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創下歷史新高。今年至今，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南已分別錄得超過二萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得586宗本地感染病例，以廣州、佛山、潮州和深圳的病例較多。

登革熱是透過帶有登革熱病毒的雌性伊蚊叮咬而傳染給人類。病徵與基孔肯雅熱類似，包括高燒、頭痛、眼窩後疼痛、肌肉及關節痛、出疹等，潛伏期通常為四至七天。登革出血熱是一種較為嚴重的登革熱病，患者有出血跡象，死亡率可高達20%。曾經感染登革熱的患者當再次感染另一類型登革熱病毒時有機會出現登革出血熱。

（三）日本腦炎

中心昨日公布一宗日本腦炎輸入個案，是本港自二○二○年以來，錄得的首宗個案。日本腦炎的主要病媒是三帶喙庫蚊。蚊子於稻田等大量積水地方繁殖，叮咬帶病毒的豬或野生雀鳥後就會受感染，再於叮咬人類或動物時將病毒傳播。日本腦炎主要流行於亞洲及西太平洋地區的郊外及農村，尤其在氣候炎熱的季節。在熱帶及亞熱帶地區，病毒傳播全年都可發生，高峰期通常為雨季。

日本腦炎由受感染至發病約為四至14日。大部分日本腦炎病人均病情輕微，除發燒及頭痛外，一般不會有其他顯著病徵，但每二百五十宗感染中便大約有一宗會出現嚴重病情，病徵包括迅速出現高燒、頭痛、頸部僵硬、喪失方向知覺、昏迷、抽搐、痙攣性癱瘓，甚至死亡。

（四）寨卡病毒

本港今年並未錄得寨卡病毒感染個案，但於二○二三年及二○二四年，分別錄得兩宗及三宗輸入個案，涉及的病人在潛伏期內分別曾到印度及泰國。監測數據顯示，東南亞地區、印度和美洲等地近年錄得較多感染寨卡病毒個案。

本港現時沒有發現主要傳播寨卡病毒的埃及伊蚊，但其他種類的伊蚊（如白紋伊蚊）亦被視為可能的病媒。寨卡病毒的病徵包括皮疹、發燒、結膜炎、頭痛、肌肉和關節疼痛等，但大部分人於感染寨卡病毒後不會出現病徵。懷孕期間如感染寨卡病毒可能會令初生嬰兒出現小頭症和其他先天性缺陷，所以懷孕婦女如前往受影響地區應加倍留意感染風險，並須做好預防蚊媒傳染病的措施。

為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是最有效預防蚊傳疾病的方法。可傳播基孔肯雅病毒、登革熱病毒及寨卡病毒的白紋伊蚊在本港很常見，而傳播日本腦炎的主要病媒蚊三帶喙庫蚊亦於本地存在。市民不論在本地或外遊，應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。

​財庫局局長主持檢討政府採購機制專責小組首次會議後會見傳媒談話內容（附短片）,2025-08-21 17:22,2025-08-21 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100614.htm,"檢討政府採購機制專責小組今日（八月二十一日）舉行首次會議，財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇、財庫局常任秘書長（庫務）黎志華和政府物流服務署署長陳嘉信在會議後會見傳媒。以下為談話內容：

財經事務及庫務局局長：各位傳媒朋友大家好，星期日我們公布以三重行動去跟進政府採購樽裝飲用水的事件。第一方面是主動邀請審計署進行審查。審計署已經開展相關工作，包括日前到政府物流服務署與物流署署長和相關人員會面。

第二方面，物流署亦加緊做好善後工作。星期一，物流署已終止相關公司（鑫鼎鑫商貿有限公司）的樽裝飲用水合約，以及另外三張與其負責人有關聯的化學品合約。物流署亦協調其他政策局和部門處理與這公司或其負責人相關的合約，全數合共兩份合約昨日已即時終止。我們會根據合約條款向有關公司追討損失。

最後一項就是成立專責小組。今日早上，由我擔任主席的檢討政府採購機制專責小組召開了第一次會議，成員包括財經事務及庫務局常任秘書長（庫務）黎志華、政府物流服務署署長陳嘉信，以及公務員事務局、商務及經濟發展局、發展局和律政司的代表。

大家看到專責小組的成員是跨局、跨部門的。我們期望借助不同範疇同事的專業經驗，從巿場運作、技術要求、法律和人事等不同角度，與我們一起審視是次招標，以此作出發點，整體去檢視採購機制和過程，加強當中不同節點上的把關能力。

會議上，我們討論了檢討的方向和範圍，包括今次招標處理過程、合約管理等方面哪些部分有所疏漏和不足。在制度層面，又可以怎樣完善招標和採購？此外，專責小組認為在檢討報告完成前，為了盡早改進政府的招標採購程序，堵塞漏洞，亦應在中期就一些重點事項，例如盡職調查、招標準則、合約管理和質量保證等各方面提出即時可行的建議方案。所以我們不會等到檢討在三個月後完結時，才有報告向市民公布，政府在中期也會有公布及有所行動。

我明白大家亦很關注會否有人需要為事件負責。現時審計署已經展開並啟動相關審查，若調查發現有人為因素或的確由疏忽引致，政府必定會根據公務員紀律機制或工作表現管理制度嚴肅處理。

現在我將時間交給常任秘書長。

財經事務及庫務局常任秘書長（庫務）：大家好。首先，我想向大家介紹政府採購政策，這是財經事務及庫務局的工作之一。政府採購政策目標是希望能以最具經濟效益的方法，為政府採購所需要的貨品或服務，價錢和質素是並重的。在這過程中，是希望能確保以公平、公開和清晰的方法進行採購。檢討政府採購機制專責小組今日召開了首次會議，我會帶領財經事務及庫務局的同事全力支持小組的工作，當優化建議落實後，我會確保政府物流服務署的同事能夠盡快和全力落實和推進這些建議。

政府物流服務署署長：多謝局長和常秘。剛才局長介紹了專責小組今日開會的工作進展，物流署會全力配合專責小組審視現有政府採購機制的工作，當檢討完成並提出相關建議，物流署定會盡力、盡快落實相關建議，以完善現行採購機制。

今次事件突顯現行的採購機制未必有足夠能力完全堵塞存心詐騙的投標者獲取政府合約。

據初步理解，懷疑涉及詐騙手段而獲取樽裝飲用水合約的公司可能是以不正當手段獲取一部分真實的文件，也有透過可能涉及偽造成分的文件，去滿足投標要求，令物流署同事在審查相關文件時，未能及時察覺可能有造假的成分。在進行今次檢討時，我們會特別注意如何能夠讓同事提高警惕，及早防範這類詐騙的情況再次發生。

由於這個涉嫌以詐騙手段謀取政府樽裝飲用水合約的案件在過去數天每日都有許多新發展，我與其他物流署同事在過去幾日一直忙於處理由今次事件所引發的一連串跟進工作，包括協助警方及其他執法部門進行調查、回應傳媒就此事的眾多查詢，也同時要處理其他就終止相關公司合約的善後安排，例如安排新供應商暫時為港島和部分離島政府辦公室供應樽裝飲用水，以及聯絡其他政府部門終止與該公司及其負責人有關連的公司的政府合約。若這些公司有獲取政府合約，也一定要同時終止。我在星期二亦與審計署同事進行了詳盡的會面，介紹現行物流署的採購機制，協助審計署審視現有的機制，以協助他們盡快完成審視的工作。

我留意到昨日有新聞報道提及審計署在二○一二年的報告中提及物流署曾就政府採購樽裝水提出三項加強質素保證措施。我在此想強調，物流署已經全面落實這三項加強質素保證措施，並已作出多方面的優化工作。

當中包括：物流署現時已在政府的招標條款中規定，如在截標日期前36個月內，投標者在過往（履行）其他政府合約時發生重大違約事件，他們提出的標書是會被取消（投標者）資格的。另外，現有的合約條文已清楚表明，要求所有樽裝水供應商提交令物流署滿意的應變計劃。第三，現有的合約文件已清楚訂明要求所有樽裝水供應商每兩個月提交由獨立認可實驗室發出的水質測試報告。

今次這個涉嫌詐騙的案件亦帶出我們有需要全面審視及完善現行的政府採購程序。正如我剛才所說，物流署會全面配合審計署及由局長領導的專責小組盡快完成有關檢討，落實相關建議，以完善現行採購機制。

最後，我想藉今日的機會表達，我十分理解今次涉及詐騙案引起社會對政府採購方面的重大關注，以及影響到政府同事對飲用供應商提供的樽裝水產生安全疑慮，就此方面，我認為我們在程序上確有不足。就此，我代表物流署向大家致歉。

記者：剛才署長說了很多跟進善後工作，可否解釋一下，第一次緊急會議為甚麼你沒有出席？善後上有甚麼要做？例如今次的合約，是否找另一間公司頂替就算？花了多少錢？另外想問局長，剛才說到初步發現可能有人詐騙，是不是在盡職調查上沒有做好？涉及一些跨境公司時，相關工作是不是有困難，需要的時間多了，而今次有疏忽呢？

財經事務及庫務局局長：首先關於星期日（八月十七日）的情況，大家都看到，星期日我們公布了三重行動，這也是我們召開緊急會議的討論結果。當時我們請了不同的同事，主要是希望能夠很具體地知道合約本身的操作情況和流程，所以我請物流署採購部門的負責人，以及他們具體負責的同事來解釋相關情況。當時物流署副署長是在場的，這是第一方面。

第二方面，你剛才所說的就是盡職調查這方面，我們希望盡快，即不用等三個月，而是在中期的時候已經有所公布。當中的重點正是你剛才所說的，這個我們現在盡快做，希望在三個月完結前，能夠將相關結果與大家分享。

政府物流服務署署長：關於我們的善後工作，我們現在是請了另一間供應商，為港島和部分離島區的辦公室提供飲用水。委託這間供應商主要是考慮到它是為港島（和部分離島區）辦公室提供飲用水的上一份合約（中標）公司，特別是它在運輸方面有能力將飲用水分派去不同的辦公室。基於這樣的考慮，加上時間很趕急，我們就找上次（中標）的公司提供飲用水。這只是一個臨時安排，我們打算再次進行正式招標，看看下次飲用水的投標者是哪些公司。在進行這個招標前，我們很希望參考審計署，以及局長領導的這個專責小組所提出的意見，看看有甚麼是我們可以納入將來的標書（要求）內，令新的招標過程更為完善。

記者：署長，局方說你有主體責任，你會怎樣問責？採購方面，導致這次「無牌水」事件的涉事公司財務狀況那麼差，而且負責人有詐騙背景都能中標，是怎麼一回事？把關那麼不嚴謹，物流署有沒有人私相授受？廉政公署會不會邀請你們一起接受調查？

政府物流服務署署長：在採購樽裝飲用水這問題上，主力是由物流署負責的，所以在這件事上，主體責任由物流署承擔，這點我們是責無旁貸的。

至於在公司審查方面，就財務審查，根據我們現行的採購規例，對於購買貨品，一般來說我們沒有對這些提供貨品的公司作出財務審查，原因是購買貨品和購買服務有點不同。例如購買清潔服務，因為公司在合約期內要聘請很多工人，或購買很多機器，才有足夠能力去落實合約要求。如果這間公司沒有足夠能力，政府也不會放心讓它執行相關合約。但購買貨品有一個不同的地方，就是現在的標準合約條款列明，一定是貨到才付款，而且是要先檢驗貨物，滿足到標書列明的細節及技術要求，我們才會付款。一般來說有三十天的付款期。加上在採購貨品方面，我們會要求供應商向政府提供大概等同合約整體價值百分之二的按金。我們收到按金後，如果發現供應商未能履行合約要求，政府可能要作出追討時，我們也有按金可以彌補追討過程中政府所承受的損失。

記者：剛才也談及一些招標流程，其實一般商業機構的做法會包括實地檢測，或親身了解相關公司的背景，其實為甚麼政府在這個招標過程，不需要這樣做呢？日後是否需要檢討，或認為有沒有漏洞呢？另外是關於一共終止了六份合約，除了飲用水的合約外，另外五份合約有否存在一些詐騙或違法的行為？昨日才終止的兩份合約，為甚麼相對另外四份合約會遲了一天才公布？

政府物流服務署署長：就我們對投標者背景的了解，在採購貨品時，我們會嚴格跟從相關守則去進行，例如我們一定要清楚了解這間公司有合格的商業登記及公司註冊證明。這次我們採購樽裝飲用水，這間公司是透過一間樽裝飲用水製造工廠去提供相關貨品，我們有透過招標條款清楚要求這些公司需提交相關製造飲用水或製造食品的執照文件。另外，由於涉及水質安全，我們也要求這些投標者提交由獨立實驗室所作的測試，證明它的水質是合乎我們的標準。另外，我們也有一個要求，若他們有ISO（國際標準化組織）認證也需提交。若這些公司提交認證文件的副本，我們也需找公證行去證明這些副本是真實無誤。如果這些公司欲夥拍另一間飲用水製造商供應相關飲用水，我們也會要求這些公司提交一份意向書，證明若這投標者獲得這份合約，相關工廠會有能力去供應飲用水給政府。

財經事務及庫務局常任秘書長（庫務）：我們第一次公布取消的四張合約，全部都是由物流署判出去的合約，所以物流署有第一手資料，我們可以即時做到這個安排。而當我們決定了整個政府要全面取消與這公司或其關聯人士相關公司的合約，我們聯絡了所有政策局及部門，截至昨日所得的信息，是有兩份合約，所以昨晚有一個新的公布。

現時我們手上的資料是共有六份合約跟這間公司或其關聯人士有關。隨着我們取消合約，相關部門會很認真審視究竟這間公司在過往一段時間提供的服務或貨品，有沒有涉及欺詐成分，或者整個流程有沒有一些可疑地方，相關部門一定會認真嚴肅地去全面跟進，如果發現到有違規違法，一定會交給執法機構跟進。

記者：首先想問，接下來政府專責小組和審計署會有一個調查報告，接下來會否公開，公開或不公開的原因是甚麼？四份合約現在都有一個終止的情況，會怎樣去做替代？再問一下有關水的事件，剛才也提到，招標過程有很多不同準則，包括價錢和技術。其實，物流署在審視這次的問題上，是基於甚麼原因去判斷這家公司，這數天以來看到那麼多問題，都依然判給這家公司，它有甚麼技術優勢，令你們覺得最終以往那些都不合適，他們是合適呢？另外就是剛才說貨到才付款，要滿足了招標細節才會付錢，那付了二千多元，你們是做了甚麼流程去核實才付那二千多元呢？

財經事務及庫務局局長：從公眾利益角度，我們一定會開誠布公的，但當然這個個案本身已有執法部門介入，在不影響的情況下，我們會公布相關的報告內容的。

政府物流服務署署長：在審批這次採購樽裝飲用水的過程，我們考慮的重點一定是要滿足到我們所訂定對於水質的要求，一定要符合香港相關法例、食物安全中心對於三個微生物含量的標準，這一點是最重要的。另外，我們亦列明，一定要他們可以證明這間工廠有生產能力可以滿足到需要，才可以讓他們進入下一輪審視。在完全滿足了我們對於這些技術層面的要求時，就會看價錢。價錢來說，一般都是價低者得。以這次投標來說，現時中標的那幾間公司都是在其個別區域，即港島區、九龍區和新界區，是價格最低的投標者。

現在提到有某部門支付了大概二千多元給鑫鼎鑫，正如早前在新聞公布內指出，我們可以從按金，因為鑫鼎鑫已給了超過一百萬元的按金，是可以從那裏扣除的。除此以外，如果由整個事件引發，譬如我們要再重新委託另一間供應商供應飲用水，若政府有財政上的損失，我們也保留追究權利。現時的替代安排其實可以參考飲用水的安排，政府在這類緊急情況下，是容許部門透過直接購買，即是不需要再安排一個招標過程去供應原先需要的產品。

Following are the remarks:

Reporter: Secretary, first of all, looking back at the tendering process so far, can you tell us what specific red flags do you think were missed and how many of those have been caught earlier? And you mentioned that there will be some improvement measures to be carried out in the mid-term of the review by the Task Force. Can you specify what do you mean by mid-term and what kind of measures will be carried out? And finally, you mentioned that the GLD is the primary party to be held responsible for the matter. Have any officials in the department been carried out any sort of disciplinary action?

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: That's exactly the purpose of my chairing the task force this morning, to make reference to this incident and to identify any systemic issues that we need to deal with at the system and also at the process level. In particular, as you highlighted in your second question, we will look at areas like in terms of the due diligence required and the issues on the contract management and also quality control. These are the relevant aspects that will be covered in our interim result, because what we would expect is that before we make the final announcement, we hopefully would like to get the result earlier than the three months that we said earlier.

CS visits Beijing (with video),2025-08-21 17:05,2025-08-21 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100626.htm,"  The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, arrived in Beijing yesterday afternoon (August 20) to begin his visit.

 Mr Chan first called on the Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang, and briefed Mr Xu on the latest developments in advancing patriotic education and the progress of organising the 15th National Games in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. The Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai, also attended the meeting.

 Mr Chan stated that since the establishment of the Working Group on Patriotic Education last year, it has formulated short-, medium-, and long-term objectives and policy measures tailored to Hong Kong's specific circumstances. The group has actively carried out extensive work and achieved remarkable results. He expressed his sincere gratitude to the Central Government for its continued care and support of the HKSAR Government's promotion of patriotic education. On the other hand, the HKSAR Government is collaborating closely with the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Macao Special Administrative Region Government on preparations for the 15th National Games, the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games, contributing to the country's efforts to become a sporting powerhouse. The Government will also leverage this opportunity to deepen co-operation with cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and jointly build a world-class bay area.

 This morning (August 21), Mr Chan attended the establishment ceremony of the Patriotic Education Base for Hong Kong and Macao Youth. With the support of the Central Government, the first Patriotism Education Base for Hong Kong and Macao Youth has been established at the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, located by the Lugou Bridge. The base aims to provide young students and teachers from Hong Kong and Macao with enhanced first-hand experience, enabling them to study and understand the country's development, helping them develop a sense of nationhood and national identity, and inspiring patriotic sentiments. The establishment of the first education base holds particular significance as it coincides with the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.

 At the establishment ceremony, Mr Chan said that the establishment of the Education Base marks an important milestone in Hong Kong's implementation of patriotic education. The Education Base will serve as a crucial platform for deepening Hong Kong and Macao youth's affection for their home and country, and their understanding of the country's history, as well as enhancing their sense of patriotism, which is highly significant in nurturing a new generation devoted to the country and ready to shoulder their mission. He expressed his hope to develop more patriotic education resources nationwide in the future, enabling more Hong Kong and Macao youth to strengthen their national and ethnic identity through site visits and cultural exchange, gain a deeper understanding of the history and achievements of the country, and work together to create a brilliant future for the motherland.

 Officials attending the ceremony today included Mr Xu; Vice Mayor of Beijing Mr Xia Linmao; Mr Chan; Mr Tsang; and the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture of the Macao Special Administrative Region Government, Ms O Lam. The Convenor of the Working Group on Patriotic Education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee, Dr Starry Lee, also attended the ceremony.

 Mr Chan and the delegation concluded their visit and returned to Hong Kong this afternoon."

He expressed his hope to develop more patriotic education resources nationwide in the future, enabling more Hong Kong and Macao youth to strengthen their national and ethnic identity through site visits and cultural exchange, gain a deeper understanding of the history and achievements of the country, and work together to create a brilliant future for the motherland.

 Officials attending the ceremony today included Mr Xu; Vice Mayor of Beijing, Mr Xia Linmao; Mr Chan; Mr Tsang; and the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture of the Macao Special Administrative Region Government, Ms O Lam. The Convenor of the Working Group on Patriotic Education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee, Dr Starry Lee, also attended the ceremony.

 Mr Chan first called on the Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang, and briefed Mr Xu on the latest developments in advancing patriotic education and the progress of organising the 15th National Games in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. The Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai, also attended the meeting.

 Mr Chan stated that since the establishment of the Working Group on Patriotic Education last year, it has formulated short-, medium-, and long-term objectives and policy measures tailored to Hong Kong's specific circumstances. The group has actively carried out extensive work and achieved remarkable results. He expressed his sincere gratitude to the Central Government for its continued care and support of the HKSAR Government's promotion of patriotic education. On the other hand, the HKSAR Government is collaborating closely with the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Macao Special Administrative Region Government on preparations for the 15th National Games, the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games, contributing to the country's efforts to become a sporting powerhouse. The Government will also leverage this opportunity to deepen co-operation with cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and jointly build a world-class bay area.

 This morning (August 21), Mr Chan attended the establishment ceremony of the Patriotic Education Base for Hong Kong and Macao Youth. With the support of the Central Government, the first Patriotism Education Base for Hong Kong and Macao Youth has been established at the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, located by the Lugou Bridge. The base aims to provide young students and teachers from Hong Kong and Macao with enhanced first-hand experience, enabling them to study and understand the country's development, helping them develop a sense of nationhood and national identity, and inspiring patriotic sentiments. The establishment of the first education base holds particular significance as it coincides with the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.

 At the establishment ceremony, Mr Chan said that the establishment of the Education Base marks an important milestone in Hong Kong's implementation of patriotic education. The Education Base will serve as a crucial platform for deepening Hong Kong and Macao youth's affection for their home and country, and their understanding of the country's history, as well as enhancing their sense of patriotism, which is highly significant in nurturing a new generation devoted to the country and ready to shoulder their mission.

​香港海關今年上半年從源頭堵截私煙取得顯著成效（附圖）,2025-08-21 17:05,2025-08-21 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100502.htm,"香港海關一直致力促進亞太區內海關合作，從源頭打擊跨境走私香煙，並接連破獲不同類型的跨境走私香煙案件，成效顯著。今年上半年，海關共偵破八十四宗大型走私香煙入口案件，檢獲約二億七千八百萬支私煙，估計市值約十二億五千萬元，應課稅值約九億二千萬元。

香港海關自去年十一月與澳洲邊防局合辦亞太區打擊私煙執法會議後，繼續積極深化區域內的合作，並因應走私形勢調整執法策略，進一步加強從源頭堵截私煙的執法力度。

今年年初，香港海關與內地海關緝私部門展開針對海上走私香煙集團的聯合雷達監控行動，破獲四宗大型海路走私香煙案件，在四艘漁船上檢獲共約四千九百萬支私煙。

今年三月至七月，香港海關與新加坡海關進行代號「截源」的聯合行動，偵破多宗海運走私香煙的大型案件，在三十三個由新加坡到港的貨櫃內檢獲共約一億零七百萬支私煙。

海關亦加強打擊空運走私香煙活動。今年上半年，海關針對航空旅客走私香煙採取特別執法行動，破獲四十四宗相關案件，拘捕四十八名旅客，檢獲共約一百四十萬支私煙。此外，海關破獲多宗空運郵包走私香煙案件，檢獲共約一千三百萬支私煙，並進行十一次監控遞送行動，拘捕七名人士。

海關會繼續與內地及其他執法機構保持緊密聯繫和加強情報交流，嚴厲打擊跨境私煙活動。

海關強調，走私屬嚴重罪行。根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。此外，根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Hong Kong Customs achieves notable results in intercepting illicit cigarettes at source during first half of 2025 (with photo),2025-08-21 17:05,2025-08-21 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100504.htm,"Hong Kong Customs has long been committed to promoting Customs co-operation in the Asia-Pacific (A/P) region to combat cross-boundary illicit cigarette activities at source. Fruitful results have been achieved, with various kinds of cross-boundary cigarette smuggling cases detected. During the first half of this year, Customs detected 84 large-scale illicit cigarette smuggling cases and seized about 278 million illicit cigarettes in total, with an estimated market value of about $1.25 billion and a duty potential of about $920 million.

Following the Regional Conference on Combating Illicit Cigarettes cohosted with the Australian Border Force in November last year, Hong Kong Customs continues to actively strengthen regional co-operation in the A/P region, and adjusts its enforcement strategies in response to evolving smuggling trends to further step up enforcement actions to curb the inflow of illicit cigarettes at source.

Early this year, Hong Kong Customs and the anti-smuggling departments of Mainland Customs mounted a joint radar surveillance operation targeting maritime cigarette smuggling syndicates, detecting four large-scale maritime illicit cigarette smuggling cases, seizing a total of about 49 million illicit cigarettes on four fishing vessels.

Between March and July this year, Hong Kong Customs and Singapore Customs mounted a joint operation codenamed ""Cutflow"" and detected multiple large-scale cigarette smuggling cases by sea, seizing a total of about 107 million illicit cigarettes in 33 sea-borne containers arriving in Hong Kong from Singapore.

Customs also reinforced enforcement actions against air smuggling of illicit cigarettes. During the first half of this year, Customs mounted a special enforcement operation against illicit cigarette smuggling activities involving air passengers, and detected 44 related cases with 48 passengers arrested and a total of about 1.4 million illicit cigarettes seized. Moreover, Customs detected multiple smuggling cases of illicit cigarettes through air parcels and seized a total of about 130 million illicit cigarettes. Eleven controlled delivery operations were conducted, and seven persons were arrested.

Customs will continue to maintain close liaison and strengthen intelligence exchanges with Mainland and other law enforcement agencies to vigorously combat cross-boundary illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction. Moreover, under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.
â
Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Utilising a cross-bureau and cross-departmental approach, the Task Force will review the existing Government procurement regime and procedures arising from the recent incident on the Government's procurement of bottled drinking water to perform its gatekeeping role effectively and remedy deficiencies.

  The Task Force is chaired by Mr Hui, with members that include the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Treasury), Mr Andrew Lai; the Director of Government Logistics, Mr Carlson Chan; and representatives from the Civil Service Bureau, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Development Bureau and the Department of Justice.

  The meeting established the direction and scope of the review, and identified certain areas of oversight or deficiencies at the organisational, systemic and implementation levels. In addition, the meeting discussed various improvement proposals.

  The Task Force also set a timetable for the upcoming work with a view to putting forward a review report on the preliminary recommendations available after three months.

  Mr Hui said, ""In order to enhance the tendering and procurement procedures at the earliest time, in the interim, we have plans to put forward ready-to-implement proposals on major areas such as due diligence, tender requirements, contract management and quality assurance to enhance gatekeeping at different aspects and remedy deficiencies."""

陳國基首先拜會中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任徐啟方，介紹香港特別行政區（特區）政府推動愛國主義教育的最新情況，以及籌辦第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）香港賽區賽事的最新進展。政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞亦有出席。

陳國基表示，自去年成立「愛國主義教育工作小組」後，小組按香港實際情況訂定了短、中、長期工作目標和政策措施，並已積極開展大量工作，成效顯著。他衷心感謝中央政府一直以來對特區政府推動愛國主義教育的關心與支持。另一方面，特區政府正積極與廣東省和澳門特區政府緊密合作，做好​十五運會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會的籌備工作，為國家體育強國建設貢獻力量，並藉此契機全力深化與粵港澳大灣區各城市的交流合作，共建一流灣區。

Consumer Price Indices for July 2025,2025-08-21 16:30,2025-08-21 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100279.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (August 21) the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for July 2025. According to the Composite CPI, overall consumer prices rose by 1.0% in July 2025 over the same month a year earlier, smaller than the corresponding increase (1.4%) in June 2025. The smaller increase in July 2025 was mainly due to the lower ceiling of rates concession in June 2025 when compared with the same month last year, whereas there was no such concession in July in both years. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in July 2025 was 1.0%, the same as that in June 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of change in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending July 2025 was 0.2%, and that for the 3-month period ending June 2025 was 0.0%. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of change were both 0.1%.

  Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.5%, 0.9% and 0.6% respectively in July 2025, as compared to 2.1%, 1.3% and 0.9% respectively in June 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.4%, 0.9% and 0.6% respectively in July 2025, as compared to 1.5%, 0.9% and 0.7% respectively in June 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending July 2025, the average monthly rates of change in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. The corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending June 2025 were all 0.0%. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending July 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.0% respectively, and the corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending June 2025 were 0.2%, 0.1% and 0.0% respectively.

  Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in July 2025 for housing (1.8%), alcoholic drinks and tobacco (1.7%), transport (1.4%), meals out and takeaway food (1.3%), miscellaneous services (1.0%), electricity, gas and water (0.7%), and miscellaneous goods (0.3%).

  On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in July 2025 for clothing and footwear (-3.3%), durable goods (-2.3%), and basic food (-0.1%).

  Taking the first 7 months of 2025 together, the Composite CPI rose by 1.6% over a year earlier. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.2%, 1.4% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.2%, 1.5%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

  For the 3 months ending July 2025, the Composite CPI rose by 1.5% over a year earlier, while the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) rose by 2.1%, 1.3% and 0.9% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.0%, 1.4%, 0.9% and 0.7% respectively.

  For the 12 months ending July 2025, the Composite CPI was on average 1.7% higher than that in the preceding 12-month period. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.2%, 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.2%, 1.4%, 1.1% and 1.0% respectively.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed modest in July. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.0% over a year earlier, same as the increase in the preceding month. Price pressures on major components were largely contained.

  Looking ahead, as pressures from domestic costs and external prices stay broadly in check, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term.

評論

政府發言人表示，七月消費物價通脹保持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數按年上升1.0%，與上月的升幅相同。主要組成項目的價格壓力大致受控。

展望將來，由於本地成本和外圍價格壓力仍大致可控，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。

Duncan (President of the Hong Kong Information Technology Joint Council and Member of the Legislative Council, Mr Duncan Chiu), é¦è¼ (Honorary President of the Hong Kong Information Technology Joint Council and Member of the Legislative Council, Professor William Wong), Tony (Chair of the Organising Committee of the Belt and Road Software Pavilion 2025, Mr Tony Hau), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to join you all today at the opening ceremony of the second edition of the Belt and Road Software Pavilion. Let me first extend my sincere thanks to the Hong Kong Information Technology Joint Council and the Chamber of Hong Kong Computer Industry for organising this important flagship event. To all our distinguished guests who have travelled from near and far, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong.

As we speak about the Belt and Road, it is worth taking a moment to reflect on the enduring spirit of the Initiative. Since it was first proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative has been guided by the core principles of connectivity, openness, mutual respect and shared prosperity. Over the years, its breadth and depth of co-operation have been continuously expanding. Beyond physical infrastructure development across continents, technological collaboration has become an increasingly vital dimension.

Recent studies show that China's technology-related investments in Belt and Road countries have grown significantly, from US$24 billion in 2023 to over US$30 billion in 2024. In just the first half of this year, such investments have already reached US$23 billion, more than doubling year on year.

We take pride in China's emergence as a global leader in innovation - particularly in cutting-edge areas such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and green tech. Chinese innovators and start-ups are making their mark on the global stage by offering solutions that not only rival the best in the world, but are also open, cost-effective and inclusive. These advancements are creating real impact, improving lives, and enabling sustainable growth in Belt and Road economies. 

In today's interconnected world, digital transformation is reshaping industries, governments and communities. At the same time, it has also brought about daunting challenges - from widening digital divide and rising cybersecurity risks, to increased technological fragmentation. These challenges cannot be addressed by any single economy alone. They demand open dialogue, deeper collaboration and cross-border partnerships.

That is why I am pleased to see events like today's to take place in Hong Kong. The Pavilion this year brings together over 120 innovation and technology enterprises from Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and beyond. From fintech and smart healthcare, to cloud computing, 5G technology and city management, this place showcases a broad spectrum of digital solutions. It is a vivid demonstration of how we can work together to harness the power of innovation and technology to uplift communities and improve lives across regions.
 
Today's event also highlights two key value propositions of Hong Kong. First, under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong remains a free and open economy with the free flow of capital, data, talent and goods. We serve as a ""super connector"", a platform that welcomes and facilitates technological exchanges, collaboration and investment. For users and partners from Belt and Road countries and the Global South, Hong Kong offers access not only to world-class technologies and expertise from across the globe, but also a full range of funding support. For solution developers and tech providers, Hong Kong offers internationally acknowledged testing grounds, professional services, and seamless access to global markets and capital.

Second, Hong Kong - together with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area - is fast emerging as the world's leading centre for I&T. I am confident that many of our homegrown innovations, which are showcased here today, will attract international interest. Indeed, many of our start-ups have already found success in overseas markets. Over the past few years, we have launched a comprehensive strategy to accelerate I&T development in four key areas: AI, biotech, fintech, and new energy and new materials. We have made substantial investments to build a vibrant eco-system. From supporting basic translational research and commercialisation, to incubating start-ups and attracting enterprises and talent, we are scaling up Hong Kong's tech ecosystem from upstream to downstream.

In terms of digital policy, over the past two years, we have put in place an action plan, covering such areas as digital infrastructure and governance, digital transformation, cross-boundary flows of data and talent development. Our vision is to unlock the full value of data, and enhance economic inclusiveness through digitalisation. In particular, Hong Kong's unique position as a convergence point for both Mainland and international data gives us a distinct advantage in developing data-driven industries such as AI and biotech.

As of last year, Hong Kong was home to around 4 700 start-ups, representing a 40 per cent increase since 2020. Notably, about 30 per cent of these start-ups were founded by entrepreneurs from outside Hong Kong, reflecting our city's global connectivity and appeal. Our tech ecosystem is open and welcoming, and we look forward to more talent from around the world to join us and thrive together.

Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot better conclude by reiterating the spirit of openness, mutual respect, collaboration and shared progress that lies at the heart of the Belt and Road Initiative. This is what this event echoes. I am confident that the event today will once again be a dynamic platform for experience sharing, knowledge exchanges and partnership-building. I wish you all a fruitful, rewarding and inspiring event, and the best of health and business for the time to come.

Thank you."

As of last year, Hong Kong was home to around 4 700 start-ups, representing a 40 per cent increase since 2020. Notably, about 30 per cent of these start-ups were founded by entrepreneurs from outside Hong Kong, reflecting our city's global connectivity and appeal. Our tech ecosystem is open and welcoming, and we look forward to more talent from around the world to join us and thrive together.

Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot better conclude by reiterating the spirit of openness, mutual respect, collaboration and shared progress that lies at the heart of the Belt and Road Initiative. This is what this event echoes. I am confident that the event today will once again be a dynamic platform for experience sharing, knowledge exchanges and partnership-building. I wish you all a fruitful, rewarding and inspiring event, and the best of health and business for the time to come.

Thank you."

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-21 15:45,2025-08-21 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100537.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 21) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

The case involved an unauthorised building structure with an area of about 390 square metres on the roof of an industrial building on Sam Chuk Street, Wong Tai Sin. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (August 21), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference.

"Film Programmes Office to launch screening programme ""!NSPIRE Series 2025: Integrating the Modern and the Traditional: Chinese Humanism and Hong Kong Cinema"" (with photos)",2025-08-21 15:35,2025-08-21 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100331.htm,"  The Film Programmes Office of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) will present the programme ""!NSPIRE Series 2025: Integrating the Modern and the Traditional: Chinese Humanism and Hong Kong Cinema"" from September 21 to October 25, showcasing 12 films highlighting humanistic values at the Cinema of the Hong Kong Film Archive (HKFA). Selected films are presented under four themes, namely ""Ethos of Family and State"", ""Spirit of the Literati"", ""The Shine of Being Woman"" and ""The Legal Dimension"", each comprising two Hong Kong films showcasing Chinese culture and one foreign film as a cultural reference.

  Under the theme ""Ethos of Family and State"", ""It Was a Cold Winter Night"" (1955), adapted from a novel by Ba Jin, depicts the conflicts and struggles of a well-educated married couple in the face of war and between old and new cultures. ""The Warlords"" (2007) features epic battle scenes as well as multifarious struggles between loyalty and politics in the Taiping Rebellion during the late Qing dynasty. The Japanese film ""The Wife's Confession"" (1961) (4K restored version) tells the story of a wife who becomes a suspect in the murder of her husband, prompting reflection on traditional marriage and female representation.

  In the theme ""Spirit of the Literati"", ""Chu Yuan"" (1977), written, directed and starring Bow Fong, expresses the patriotic poet Qu Yuan's political ideals in a solemn manner. Director Ann Hui's ""The Golden Era"" (2014) tells of writer Xiao Hong's devotion to writing during times of material scarcity and political upheaval. Based on the history of the Joseon era, the film ""The Book of Fish"" (2021) is about the encounters and friendship between an exiled scholar and a local fisherman with a desire for knowledge.

  Films in the theme ""The Shine of Being Woman"" convey the struggles of modern women. In ""It So Happens to a Woman"" (1955), Hung Sin Nui plays the role of a career woman in the 1950s when society is in the ebbs and flows of the cultures of old and new, illustrating women's struggles between family and career. ""Sisters of the World Unite"" (1991) is a story about how two sisters, played by Sylvia Chang and Sally Yeh, in their middle age with distinct personalities and fates support each other through thick and thin. In Korean film ""Bound by Chastity Rule"" (1962), a young widow becomes pregnant after falling in love with a young man working in a rural village but is separated from her lover and newborn son under the arch of chastity.

  In the theme ""The Legal Dimension"", the film ""The Adulteress"" (1962) tells the story of Xiao Bai Cai, who is defiled by the son of a local government official, and later falsely accused of adultery and murdering her husband with her former lover. In ""Lawyer Lawyer"" (1997), Chan Mong-gut, a legendary lawyer, defends his apprentice framed for a crime in a court of law, reflecting the mentality of ordinary people in a satirical way. The classic American courtroom film ""Anatomy of a Murder"" (1959)(4K restored version) revolves around a murder case with plenty of complex emotions and motives coming to light as the defence attorney unravels the intricate murder, revealing the thin line between good and evil.

政務司司長在北京聯同「愛國主義教育工作小組」組長和政制及內地事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-08-21 14:55,2025-08-21 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100490.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（八月二十一日）上午在北京出席港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地的設立儀式後，聯同「憲法和基本法推廣督導委員會」轄下的「愛國主義教育工作小組」組長李慧琼博士和政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞會見傳媒。以下是他們會見傳媒的談話內容：

政務司司長：各位傳媒朋友，大家好。我們剛才參觀了中國人民抗日戰爭紀念館，雖然時間有限，未能夠一一細看每項展品，但感受良多——對侵華罪行感到憤慨、對受難同胞承受的苦難感到很悲憤、對英勇犧牲的先烈由衷敬佩、對得來不易的和平加倍珍惜。

今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年。14年抗戰烽火連天，中華兒女在抗戰中展示出頑強鬥志、巨大的團結力量，激勵和鼓舞着我們，讓我們身為這個偉大民族和國家的一分子感到很自豪。

我們大部分人都很幸運，沒有經歷過戰火的洗禮，甚至會對和平穩定看成理所當然。但今日的國泰民安、繁榮穩定，其實是先輩用鮮血和生命換來和捍衞。透過回望抗戰歷史，緬懷先烈，我們才能夠鑑往事，知來者，讓廣大市民更加珍愛和平。珍愛和平是我們的一個重要主旨，我們並非希望要延續仇恨，而是希望大家明白我們一定要珍惜得來不易的和平，並且從中增添堅定前行、創造未來的力量。

香港特區政府非常感謝中央一直以來對在香港推動愛國主義教育的大力支持。

在中國人民抗戰勝利80周年紀念這日子，以中國人民抗日戰爭紀念館作為首個港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地，我覺得意義非常重大。因為大家知道，這個地方坐落在盧溝橋旁邊，是抗戰時一個很重要的地點。

這次設立首個港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地，是香港愛國主義教育的重要發展，對於長遠地加深港澳青少年認識國家、提升愛國精神，有重大作用和意義，亦可以讓青少年認真反思，如果國家不安全，受苦的都是老百姓；只有國家富強，才有今日的安寧幸福。我覺得這是愛國主義教育的一個重點，也是設立這個愛國主義教育基地的重點。

抗戰歷史是中華民族的共同記憶，也是最好的愛國主義教材。愛國教育是細水長流的工作，也是人心的工作。我相信沒有其他比親身感受、民心相通更有效的教育方式。

透過實地觀察國家的歷史地點和現在的發展；透過人與人之間的直接交流和體驗，才能更全面、更立體、發自內心地了解和體會我們祖國和民族的發展歷史，提升國民身分認同，堅定愛國情懷，並且自發將實現中華民族偉大復興作為使命。

特區政府的「愛國主義教育工作小組」成立一年多以來，我們很感謝李慧琼議員擔任小組的組長，做了很多很多工作。大量的工作包括加強香港師生內地交流計劃、公民考察、增加「紅色資源」參訪點、推動香港與內地姊妹學校交流等。而今天設立首個港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地更是一大突破。特區政府和「愛國主義教育工作小組」未來會繼續積極精選更多內地愛國主義教育基地和有重大意義的地點，推廣、鼓勵更多香港民眾，特別是師生和青年前往交流考察，了解國情，提升民族自豪感。我們亦要不忘歷史，砥礪前行。

我非常期望將來每一個到訪中國人民抗日戰爭紀念館以及未來更多港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地的香港民眾，能夠透過實地考察、民心互通，增強民族認同和國家認同感，凝聚起更大、更廣泛的愛國興港力量，攜手為國家發展貢獻力量，合力開創香港安寧繁榮的新局面。

我現在請「愛國主義教育工作小組」組長李慧琼分享一下感受。謝謝各位。

「愛國主義教育工作小組」組長：感謝司長。各位傳媒朋友，各位市民，大家好。今天非常激動，首先能夠參與第一個港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地的揭牌儀式。非常感謝中央政府、港澳辦、特區政府、司長、局長和各方面的努力，讓這個有意義的愛國主義教育基地可以正式揭牌，而所選擇的時間亦是有一個歷史重要的意義在其中。

今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，這個時刻我們以這個作為第一個港澳青少年的愛國主義教育基地是意義深遠。剛剛我親自去參觀、學習了這段歷史，大家傳媒朋友都有部分跟我們一起進去了解。其實該個館是非常全面地記載了十四年奮勇抗戰的歷史。

當中我們國家取得勝利是有三千五百萬人民英勇犧牲，現在的和平是得來不易。館內令我最深感受的除了是中國人民奮勇抗戰，不怕犧牲這種精神之外，大家如果有留意，有香港、澳門、台灣以至海外同胞，包括其他國家如蘇聯等等，支持這場戰爭的重要歷史和片段。而其中香港港九獨立大隊以至秘密大營救，都有獨立篇章在當中。我相信對於日後香港青少年或社會各界來到這裏感受和學習這段歷史，是會倍感親切，亦會更加了解香港從來在國家的發展以至抗戰史裏面都有着一個重要的角色。在整段抗戰歷史裏面，東江縱隊在蒐集情報、抗擊日軍以至進行秘密大營救等等方面都發揮積極的作用。十分感謝特區政府，特別是司長、局長親自帶領下，在今年抗戰勝利80周年統籌大量的活動，包括未來即將開幕的幾個重大的展覽、電影欣賞以至論壇、考察團等等。這些會讓到社會各界，特別是青少年朋友、老師等等都有機會去回顧這段歷史。

我相信未來都會有更多市民，特別是年青人可以來到這裏去學習。回顧愛國主義教育工作小組成立一年多以來，我們這兩年都展開了大量工作，亦要特別感謝政務司司長、局長，以至所有局的大力統籌，我們去年以國家的生日作為一個節點去舉辦大量活動，今年就以抗戰勝利80周年，現在我的感受就是社會都建立了一個以愛國愛港作為主流價值的一個社會氛圍，我們要繼續努力，不忘初心，讓更多社會階層年青人都可以了解歷史，學習歷史，從而為國家香港貢獻力量，我分享到此為止。

記者：今次這個基地選擇在這裏設立，其實實際上青年朋友來到這裏會獲得甚麼？有甚麼得着？另外，剛才提到應該會在全國各地有更多這類教育資源，有沒有初步選址，這類資源會在哪裏？另外，九月三日的抗日戰爭閱兵儀式，香港會派出甚麼代表，會如何在香港對接北京方面的慶祝活動？多謝。

政務司司長：首先，今日在北京這紀念館是第一個我們設立的港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地，很有意義性，因為這是在盧溝橋旁。大家都知道在歷史上盧溝橋是很有歷史性的地點 ，也是我們全國抗戰的起點。所以我覺得這裏作為一個愛國主義教育基地，能夠讓我們的年青人首先認識歷史。正如剛才所說，我們並非要延續仇恨，這並不是我們的目標。我們的目標是他們一定要銘記歷史，知道有關歷史如何發生，國家不富強時，老百姓就受苦，他們要知道這歷史。

第二，我們要緬懷先烈。我們很多前輩、先烈，為了國家安全，為了保衞國家山河犧牲了性命，或者受傷。另外，一些無辜的老百性，剛才李慧琼組長亦引述過數字，數以千萬計地無辜犧牲。所以我們要緬懷我們的先烈。

第三，我們要珍惜和平。因為我們要知道現在得來不易的和平，並不是理所當然的，所以每個年青人，特別是學生，其實每個市民都應該要知道，要好好珍惜現時我們國家發展得這麼強大，國家在方方面面都這麼好，我覺得這方面是應該值得我們去珍惜的。

最後，我們希望他們開創未來。就是懂得為國家未來作出貢獻，所以我們作為香港市民當然要做好香港，做好香港後就做好「一國兩制」，做好「一國兩制」其實就是對國家最大的貢獻。我相信我們在這方面每個市民都應該要做到。

另一方面，我們將來亦會到不同地方，物色適合作為港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地的地點，如果有的話，我們都會繼續設立這些基地。我們的目的是希望將來香港學生或者青年朋友到內地旅遊時，安排他們到這些基地看看，令他們記憶和知道我們以前的歷史。這亦是認識我們國家一個很好的平台，希望他們將來能夠對國家更有認同感，這是我們的希望。

至於九月三日，這方面政府會有安排，邀請了一部分人士上來，會由政府安排。

記者：想問昨天拜訪了港澳辦領導，港澳辦領導有沒有新的指示，或對香港有新的觀察？對你有甚麼評價？還有想問買錯水事件，有些人覺得政府的招標程序反映了不夠嚴謹或背景審查有問題，是否需要在短期內，不是等三個月，短期之內就要處理？想問曾局長，之前曾有行會成員批評你，關於同性伴侶的登記立法制度的拉票方式，形容是一個威脅，有甚麼可以回應？面對議會的強烈反對聲音，政府會否押後立法或修訂？還有想問選委會補選93席，本身的預算要花兩億多，最終現時28人選21席，每席差不多要二千萬，覺得公帑是否用得其所？

政務司司長：我先回應一下你的問題。其實這次購買飲用水事件，特區政府非常重視，大家都見到我們馬上去做工作。這次事件，我們初步調查發現有人進行詐騙，用一些虛假文件、虛假證書進行詐騙，現時警方和海關已經進行執法調查，一旦有證據顯示任何人違法，我們一定會進行檢控。另外，關於招標程序，我想你也知道，現時審計署正特別審視這個案，檢視整個招標程序中，我們有沒有不足的地方；如有的話，又會有甚麼建議，這是審計署一直進行的工作。另一方面，許正宇局長（財經事務及庫務局局長）正召開一個跨部門會議，專門針對整個招標程序有沒有地方可以改善和改良，這方面我們會認真檢視。稍後許正宇局長亦會會見傳媒，解釋一下剛才開會的情況。

我可以肯定地說，政府十分緊張這些情況，特別是詐騙，我們很重視。以後的做法、有沒有官員需要負責，其實在政府的公務員制度中，我們有一個很明確的懲處機制，我可以向你保證，政府一定會嚴格依照機制處理這件事。

政制及內地事務局局長：剛才提到的事情，其實我們局方較早前已作出回應，我們是不會就個別評論或意見去評價的。我們目前會做好我們手上的工作，我們會耐心做好我們的工作。

至於你剛才提及關於補選的支出，剛才你所提到的主要是一個預算的開支，並不是實際的開支。當然我們在實際開支方面的支出，我們會努力去控制成本，在盡量善用公帑的原則下進行，到時最終的實際開支，要到（選舉）完結之後才可以知道。多謝。"

專責小組也訂下工作時間表，以在三個月後就初步建議提交檢討報告。

許正宇表示：「為盡早改進政府的招標採購程序，在不同節點上做好把關，堵塞漏洞，我們已計劃在中期就一些重點事項，例如盡職調查、招標準則、合約管理和質量保證提出即時可行的建議方案。」"
