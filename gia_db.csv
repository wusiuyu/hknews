政府新聞處處長在成都出席「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽開幕禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-24 15:05,2025-10-24 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400427.htm,"以下是政府新聞處處長廖李可期今日（十月二十四日）在成都出席「香港—沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽開幕禮的致辭全文：

尊敬的馬聰副主任（四川省人民政府港澳事務辦公室副主任）、李明副主任（成都市人民政府港澳事務辦公室副主任）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

早上好！歡迎大家出席由香港特別行政區政府新聞處主辦、駐成都經濟貿易辦事處協辦的「香港─沉浸式之旅」展覽——成都站的開幕式。

這個展覽自二○二三年七月已經先後在印尼、泰國、馬來西亞，還有內地的廣州，跟阿聯酋迪拜舉行。今年適逢香港特別行政區舉辦「一帶一路高峰論壇」10周年，我們特別在內地三個「一帶一路」的節點城市舉行展覽：首兩站已在上海及青島圓滿舉行，吸引近30萬名民眾參觀。

今天我們很高興把巡迴展覽帶來四川省省會成都。自二○一八年川港合作會議機制成立以來，四川和香港兩地的合作和溝通一直穩步發展，兩地已就加強多個領域的合作達成共識，當中包括「一帶一路」建設及經貿；而二○二四年的數據顯示，香港是四川最大的境外投資來源地和第四大出口地區。另外，截至二○二五年五月底，在香港上市的四川省企業累計超過40家。除了頻密來往香港與成都天府國際機場的航班，香港直達成都的高鐵列車在二○二三年開通，令兩地距離越來越近，川港兩地合作更見成果。

說到四川省，我們當然要提大熊貓，因為四川是全球最大、最完整的大熊貓棲息地。大熊貓是國寶，承傳着深厚的中華文化和生態意義，同時也連繫了內地的同胞和香港市民。我們衷心感謝中央政府贈送大熊貓給香港，大熊貓「安安」、「可可」去年從位於成都的中國大熊貓保護研究中心都江堰基地來到香港展開牠們的新生活；而早年前來香港的大熊貓「盈盈」和「樂樂」也於去年誕下可愛的大熊貓龍鳳胎「加加」和「得得」。這六隻大熊貓深得香港市民和遊客喜愛，為香港帶來很多歡樂。為此，今次的展覽也特別加入大熊貓的元素，讓成都的朋友們都可以有機會認識一下我們香港的大熊貓。此外，參與我們特設的電子互動遊戲的朋友們，也可以獲得我們送出的精緻紀念品，其中包括有香港特色的大熊貓盲盒等，希望大家喜歡。

此外，成都和香港同是「體育動感之都」，高水準的體壇盛事今年在兩地也輪流舉行，先有八月國家首次承辦世界運動會，選址在成都這個歷史文化古城舉行，中國香港隊有幸參與並獲得打破過往參與世運會的佳績，而香港則於下月與廣東省和澳門特區攜手合辦第十五屆全國運動會，並且承辦八個項目。展覽為此特設體育展區，作為全運會的預熱宣傳；而十五運會及殘特奧會吉祥物「喜洋洋」和「樂融融」今天亦在場，跟大家喜迎全運。

我們期望透過今次展覽，讓更多成都朋友認識香港、到訪香港。我們會以藝術投影方式，向參觀人士展示香港的方方面面，包括「澎湃創意之都」、「國際金融中心」、「創新及科技樞紐」和「多元和綠色城市」等展區。我們亦會透過裸眼3D和互動遊戲等藝術科技，全方位展示香港的文化旅遊魅力和最新面貌。

此外，為了讓成都民眾更認識香港的文化藝術地標——西九文化區，我們邀請了香港西九文化區管理局在展覽場地同時設置展區，以打卡裝置及扭蛋遊戲等生動方式，展示文化區的特色，大家一定不要錯過。

除了是次展覽外，新聞處一直透過不同的宣傳推廣方式，讓內地同胞更了解香港的最新發展。社交媒體平台就是一個非常重要的渠道。除了在優酷、微博及微信開設「香港品牌」帳號外，我們去年也在小紅書開通了「香港政府新聞處添馬台」專業號，希望透過這個專業號，讓更多內地朋友接觸到香港的資訊，增加互動。為鼓勵到訪展覽的朋友透過我們的帳號分享參觀的體驗，我們在展覽期間亦會舉行「快拍留影」互動遊戲，頭獎和二獎的禮物是由國泰航空慷慨贊助的雙人來回成都至香港機票，而三獎共有十個名額，每人都會獲得一套六隻的大熊貓盲盒，希望大家踴躍參加。

最後，我希望川港兩地能夠繼續善用並連接「天府之國」和「東方之珠」各自的獨特優勢，在不同領域合作共贏。我更期待大家參觀展覽後來香港旅遊、就學、營商或投資。最後，我衷心感謝各位出席今天的開幕式，亦謹祝川港兩地繁榮昌盛，大家身體健康、事事順利。謝謝大家。"

有關個䅁涉及柴灣利眾街及祥利街一幢工業大廈一個改建成為迷你倉的單位。由於有關改建及加建工程並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，並且阻礙逃生途徑及消防和救援進出途徑，同時亦影響樓宇的耐火結構，違反《建築物（規劃）規例》及《建築物（建造）規例》，屋宇署分別根據《建築物條例》第24（1）及第26條向業主發出一張清拆令及一張修葺令。該業主沒有履行法定命令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

  The case involved an alteration of a mini-storage unit in an industrial building at Lee Chung Street and Cheung Lee Street, Chai Wan. As the alteration and addition works were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), and the works obstructed the means of escape and means of access for fire fighting and rescue as well as affecting the fire resisting construction of the building, contravening the Building (Planning) Regulations and the Building (Construction) Regulation, a removal order and a repair order were served on the owner under section 24(1) and section 26 of the BO respectively. Failing to comply with the statutory orders, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

  A spokesman for the BD said today (October 24), ""Unauthorised alteration works causing obstruction to the means of escape and means of access for fire fighting and rescue, or affecting the fire resisting construction of a building may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders and repair orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders and repair orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

  Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues.

Professor Lo (Co-Chair of the Program Committee of the 2025 Future Science Prize Week, Professor Dennis Lo), Mr Wang (Rotating Chairman of the 2025 Future Science Prize Donor’s Congress, Mr Victor Wang), Professor Warshel (2013 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, Professor Arieh Warshel), Ivan (Commissioner for Innovation and Technology, Mr Ivan Lee), distinguished guests and speakers, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is really my great pleasure to join you all today at the Opening Ceremony of the 2025 Future Science Prize (FSP) Week in Hong Kong.

  This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Future Science Prize - a milestone that not only celebrates a decade of scientific excellence, but also invites us to look boldly toward the horizon. I am very delighted to welcome you all for the third time here in Hong Kong as the host city of this world-class scientific gathering.

  As just introduced by our Professor Dennis Lo, the theme of this year's event ""Shining a Light on the Future of Science,"" could not be more fitting. Science is the torch that illuminates the unknown, the compass that guides us through complexity, and the engine that propels humanity forward. The five-day programmes of the FSP Week will bring together over 100 brilliant minds from around the world to explore the frontiers of knowledge, foster interdisciplinary exchange, and inspire the next generation of thinkers and innovators.

  Scientific progress is a long and winding road, it is a journey demands vision, perseverance, and collaboration. That is why the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government has made innovation and technology (I&T) a cornerstone of our development strategy. Guided by the Hong Kong I&T Development Blueprint promulgated in December 2022, we have rolled out a series of targeted initiatives and invested heavily in infrastructure, talent, R&D (research and development) and industry development to perfect the local I&T ecosystem. And I hope all our initiatives could be beneficial to all of you. Our goal is very clear: to create a fertile ground where innovative ideas can take root, grow, and flourish here in Hong Kong and to help all of you to make your dreams get realised very soon.

  Meanwhile, we are also deepening international I&T collaboration as we firmly believe that science knows no borders. Events like the Future Science Prize Week serve as vital platforms for building bridges between disciplines, cultures, and generations. Leveraging the distinctive advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland and also being closely connected to the world under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong will continue to play its role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" in fostering international I&T collaboration.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the Future Science Prize Week reflects the highest standards of academic excellence and global perspective. In just a short while, the Science Symposium will commence with a very inspiring keynote address by Professor Arieh Warshel, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. This keynote sets the tone for a week filled with intellectual rigour and visionary dialogue. Indeed, beyond the Symposium, the Future Science Prize Week offers a rich tapestry of events designed to engage, enlighten and inspire. Some highlights include the Laureates' Dialogue with the Youth and the Award Ceremony and Concerts. So I hope that you will find it very fruitful and very meaningful and also very eventful for Hong Kong.

  Taking this opportunity, I would like to also express my deepest gratitude to Professor Dennis Lo, Mr Victor Wang, Dr Harry Sham (Co-Chair of the Program Committee of the 2025 Future Science Prize Week) and also the Organising Committee for their tireless efforts in bringing this remarkable event to life. Let us seize this moment - not only to honour the achievements of our laureates, but also to reaffirm our shared belief that science is a force for good. Let us work together to illuminate the path ahead, and may the light empower us to build a better and wiser world - for ourselves and also for generations yet to come.

âLastly, may I wish you all a very rewarding and inspiring Future Science Prize Week 2025. Thank you."

Registered contractor ordered by disciplinary board to have its name removed from register for 24 months,2025-10-24 11:00,2025-10-24 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400214.htm,"  âThe Registered Contractors' Disciplinary Board (the Board) has completed a disciplinary inquiry under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) and decided that a registered general building contractor (RGBC) should be disciplined for having been convicted by a court of an offence relating to building works.

  The Board ordered the RGBC to be removed from the register of general building contractors for 24 months, with effect from the date of the Gazette. Also, the RGBC was ordered to pay a total of $63,200, being the costs incurred by the Board and the Buildings Department (BD) for conducting the inquiry.

  The Board's written decision and order issued on October 6 was published in the Gazette today (October 24). Details are available at the following links:
https://egazette.gld.gov.hk/pdf?type=egn&year=2025&volume=29&gno=43&notice_no=6671&extra=0

  The RGBC submitted a certificate to the BD in August 2020, notifying the commencement of minor works for subdividing a unit in a residential building at Sceneway Road, Lam Tin; and a completion certificate to BD in March 2021 certifying the completion of the minor works. Subsequently, the BD conducted an audit check and revealed that the carrying out of the minor works shown in the plans submitted to the BD would result in contravention of the regulations under the BO.

  The RGBC was later prosecuted, convicted and fined $4,000 at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts in June 2022, pursuant to section 40(2AAAA) of the BO. In view of the conviction of the RGBC, the BD notified the Board for its consideration of disciplinary action against the RGBC under the provisions of section 13(1) of the BO.

  A spokesperson for the BD reiterated that any registered contractor who contravenes the relevant provisions of the BO in carrying out building works, or is convicted by any court of an offence relating to building works, or has been negligent or has misconducted himself in building works, will be subject to enforcement action including criminal prosecution and disciplinary action under the BO."

  During the reporting period, the Government consulted the SCCLR on two legislative proposals, including proposals on real estate investment trust enhancements and market conduct covering listed collective investment schemes, as well as introducing a treasury share regime for Hong Kong listed companies. In addition, the Government reported to the SCCLR on the consultation conclusions and latest legislative proposals regarding the introduction of the company re-domiciliation regime in Hong Kong and promoting paperless corporate communication for local companies.

  ""Over the years, the SCCLR has long been our important partner in modernising company law to keep abreast of the times. We sincerely appreciate the invaluable advice provided by the SCCLR during the reporting period, and look forward to continue working with the SCCLR to further strengthen Hong Kong's status as an international commercial and financial centre,"" a government spokesperson said.

  The SCCLR was set up in 1984. It advises the Financial Secretary on amendments to the Companies Ordinance and the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, as well as amendments to the Securities and Futures Ordinance on matters relating to corporate governance and shareholders’ protection, as and when necessary.

  The Chairman of the SCCLR is Mr Johnny Mok, SC. Members include practitioners from relevant professions including legal, accountancy and company secretarial fields; academics; individuals from the business community; and representatives from relevant government departments and financial regulators.

  The 2024-25 annual report of the SCCLR is available at the website of the Companies Registry (www.cr.gov.hk) for public inspection."
​行政長官在灼見名家周年論壇暨十一周年慶典致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-24 11:00,2025-10-24 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400179.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月二十四日）在灼見名家周年論壇暨十一周年慶典的視像致辭：

文灼非社長（灼見名家傳媒社長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興以視頻形式，參與灼見名家論壇，祝賀這個一年一度、匯智聚力的高質量交流平台十一周年快樂。

古語有云：「集眾思，廣忠益也」。灼見名家多年來籌辦論壇，雲集政商精英、專家學者，剖析國際形勢、洞悉國家機遇、謀劃香港藍圖。大家在此集思廣益，貢獻睿智，共同激活思維，驅動社會向前。

世事如棋局局新。當前，環球格局風雲變幻，地緣政治陰霾密布。香港作為全球最自由經濟體，必須化挑戰為機遇、於變局中開新局。今日論壇以「國際新形勢下香港如何轉型」為題，正當其時，讓我們攜手思考，在施政管治、經濟產業、創科發展等領域，為香港共謀未來，凝聚動能。

習近平主席指出，「一國兩制」具有顯著制度優勢和強大生命力，是保持香港長期繁榮穩定的好制度。香港在「一國兩制」下享有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，正是我們勇於識變求變、突破轉型的最大底氣。

香港擁有國際化、市場化的營商環境，法治傳統源遠流長，稅制簡單、稅率低廉，人才通曉兩文三語，更是全球唯一擁有五間百強大學的城市。我們近年在多項國際排名屢創佳績，處處展現競爭優勢，為經濟轉型提供動力。

我們的金融中心地位，連續兩年穩居世界第三。今年，香港的整體競爭力，上升四位，晉身世界第三；人才競爭力，躍升12位，位列世界第四；安全城市排名，躋身10大至世界第七。這些客觀評級，既充分肯定「一國兩制」的成功實踐，亦反映國際社會對香港未來的信心。

今日的香港，處於由治及興的關鍵節點。改革、轉型，正是邁向經濟更強大的必經之路。我上月公布最新一份《施政報告》，以「深化改革心繫民生發揮優勢同創未來」為主題，提出多項革新措施，包括加快發展北部都會區，促進產業發展革新，融入國家發展大局，鞏固香港國際中心地位。這些突破新局面的策略部署，正是為了推動香港轉型，邁向高質量發展。

香港轉型，有新引擎。北部都會區幅員廣闊，區位優勢獨特，發展潛力巨大，是推動香港經濟發展的新引擎。特區政府定必全力以赴，搶佔先機。我親自領導北部都會區發展委員會，提升決策層次，簡化行政流程，務求突破瓶頸，達致安全、省錢、省時間的建築目標。我們也會訂立專項法例，為北都發展全面提速提效。

香港轉型，有新賽道。面對市場急變、科技飛躍，特區政府致力促進產業結構轉型，既要鞏固金融、法律等傳統優勢產業；更要培育新興創科產業，例如先進製造、生命健康科技、新能源、人工智能與數據科學，帶動經濟多元發展，創造更多優質職位。我們亦會積極招商引資，制訂促進產業和投資的優惠政策包，吸引高增值產業、高潛力企業落戶香港，注入多元活力。

香港轉型，會把握機遇。國家作為全球第二大經濟體，更好融入國家發展大局，是香港發展的最大機遇。香港是國家高水平對外開放的重要窗口，一直擔當「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色，發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台功能，深化國際交往合作。

全球貿易秩序重塑，內地企業轉向積極出海，開拓新興市場。我們成立了內地企業出海專班，吸引和服務內地企業經由香港出海，在香港設立財資中心和區域總部，共創商機、共享繁榮。

香港轉型，會鞏固優勢。香港是享譽全球的國際金融、航運、貿易中心，亦是國際航空樞紐和國際法律及爭議解決服務中心，這些亮麗成果，是我們轉型發展的重要資產。

政府會全力發揮香港制度優勢，鞏固國際中心地位，加速發展新增長點，包括建立國際黃金交易市場，建設大宗商品交易生態圈。我們也會建立通達內陸的「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系，拓展貨源和內地廣大的市場；同時加速擴展航空版圖，並加強香港法律服務，深化調解文化。

各位朋友，時局在變，機遇在前。回望過去，香港經歷多次轉型成功；展望前路，轉型使我們更為強大。我深信，只要我們團結一致，改革創新，香港定能續創高峰，譜寫新篇。

同樣需要大家團結一致的，是即將舉行的新一屆立法會換屆選舉。選舉的提名期已在今日正式開始，而十二月七日將是投票日。我希望各位愛國愛港、有心有力的朋友，都積極參與選舉，並鼓勵你身邊的家人朋友一同投入選舉，共創未來。

最後，我祝願今日論壇百花齊放、碩果纍纍，灼見名家竿頭日進，在座各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

該承建商於二○二○年八月向屋宇署呈交證明書，通知將會在藍田匯景道一幢住宅大廈的一個單位展開分間單位小型工程，及於二○二一年三月向屋宇署呈交完工證明書，確認已完成該小型工程。其後，屋宇署進行審查，發現呈交予屋宇署的圖則所顯示的小型工程一旦進行便會導致違反《建築物條例》的相關規例。

該承建商因而被檢控，並於二○二二年六月在觀塘裁判法院被裁定違反《建築物條例》第40（2AAAA）條的規定，被定罪及判罰四千元。鑑於有關定罪，屋宇署遂根據《建築物條例》第13（1）條的規定，通知紀律委員會考慮向該承建商採取紀律行動。

屋宇署發言人重申，根據《建築物條例》，若註冊承建商進行工程時違反《建築物條例》的相關條文，或就建築工程有關的罪行被法庭定罪，或在建築工程方面犯有疏忽或行為不當，屋宇署可根據該條例採取執法行動，包括刑事檢控及紀律處分。"

Applications selected for 55th personalised vehicle registration marks exercise,2025-10-24 10:21,2025-10-24 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102300627.htm,"âThe Transport Department (TD) announced today (October 24) that the application numbers of the 1 500 personalised vehicle registration mark (PVRM) applications selected by lot for the 55th exercise have been published on its website (www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/vehicle_registration_mark/pvrm_application/index.html) and posted on the notice boards of the TD's licensing offices.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""The applicants have already been sent an acknowledgement of receipt bearing an application number. They may check the list to see whether their applications have been selected. Applicants will also be notified of the ballot results by post in batches.""

The TD will later check the proposed PVRMs selected against the basic combination requirements. If, among the selected applications, more than one applicant proposes the same PVRM, only the one on which the lot falls first out of those applications will be further processed.

If the selected PVRMs meet the basic requirements, the TD will send notices by registered mail to the applicants in batches, requiring them to pay a deposit of $5,000 within the period specified in the notice. If an applicant fails to pay the deposit within that period, his or her application will be cancelled automatically and will not be further processed.

Upon receipt of the deposit, the Commissioner for Transport will determine, with the assistance of a vetting committee, whether an application should be approved or rejected. PVRMs approved in the 55th exercise will be put up for auction in batches. Auction details will be published in newspapers and on the TD's website in due course.

For enquiries, applicants can call TD Hotline at 2804 2600."
Child passengers in private cars must use Child Restraining Device from November 1 and offending drivers may be fined (with photo),2025-10-24 10:00,2025-10-24 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102300562.htm,"  The Government today (October 24) reminded local and cross-boundary private car drivers that, starting from November 1, child passengers travelling in private cars in Hong Kong must use a Child Restraining Device (CRD), such as child safety seats, to enhance passenger safety. Offending drivers will be subject to a maximum fine of $2,000.

  From November 1, unless child passengers aged below 8 reach a body height of 1.35 metres, they must use a CRD in private cars irrespective of sitting in the front or rear seats. Passengers aged 8 or above, or with a body height of at least 1.35m must either use a CRD or wear an adult seat belt. The Police may issue a Fixed Penalty Notice of $230 to offending drivers. Serious cases may be referred to the court, which can impose a maximum fine of $2,000.

  When choosing a CRD, members of the public should accord top priority to the height and/or weight range for which the product is suitable. They should also look for any markings indicating compliance with recognised national or international standards and follow the installation guidelines. For enquiries, they should consult the manufacturer or retailer on the product standards to ensure compliance with the requirements specified in the legislation. Apart from child safety seats, portable CRDs such as seat belt adjusters, wearable safety restraint vests and foldable boosters can also be used. Yet, as they do not have protective pads and seat backs on both sides, their protection capabilities in side-impact collisions are generally not as good as those of child safety seats.

  The Government has stepped up publicity and public education since February. The Transport Department (TD) has strengthened collaboration with the Police, the Education Bureau, the Information Services Department, Radio Television Hong Kong, the Road Safety Council and the Consumer Council to introduce the legal requirements through websites, infographics, videos, media, social media, parent information websites, the ""e-Bulletin for Parents"" and publicity posters on traffic signal controllers across various districts. In addition, the TD further reminded parents to purchase CRDs for early preparations as soon as possible after Easter holidays, during the Children Products Expo in the summer vacation and prior to the first school day.

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's designated webpage on CRDs (www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/crd), infographics on the Agent T Facebook page and the relevant article in the Consumer Council's CHOICE Magazine for the legal requirements and selection tips, or call the TD's hotline 2804 2600 for enquiries."
十一月一日起兒童乘私家車須用兒童束縛設備　違例司機可被罰款（附圖）,2025-10-24 10:00,2025-10-24 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102300561.htm,"政府今日（十月二十四日）提醒本地和跨境私家車司機，由十一月一日起，兒童在香港乘坐私家車時須使用兒童束縛設備，如兒童安全座椅，加強乘車安全。違例司機最高可被判罰款2,000元。

由十一月一日起，八歲以下兒童除非身高達1.35米，否則不論坐在私家車前或後座，均須使用兒童束縛設備；八歲或以上兒童或身高至少1.35米者，則須使用兒童束縛設備或佩戴成人安全帶。違例司機可被警方發出230元定額罰款通知書；如案情嚴重則可交由法庭審理，最高罰款2,000元。

在選擇兒童束縛設備時，市民應以產品適用的身高及／或體重範圍為首要考慮，留意產品是否註有顯示符合國家或國際認可標準的標記，並按指引安裝。如有疑問，應向製造或零售商查詢產品標準，以確認符合法例要求。除兒童安全座椅外，亦可選擇便攜式兒童束縛設備，如安全帶調節器、穿戴式安全約束背心、可折疊幼兒增高座位等，但由於其兩側沒有保護墊或椅背，故保護力在側面撞擊中一般不及兒童安全座椅。

政府自二月起加強宣傳及公眾教育。運輸署與警方、教育局、政府新聞處、香港電台、道路安全議會和消費者委員會加強協作，透過網頁、懶人包、短片、傳媒、社交媒體、家長資訊網站、家長電子專遞、各區交通燈控制器宣傳畫貼等介紹法例要求。此外，署方先後藉復活節假期後、暑假兒童用品博覽及開學前，提醒家長早作準備，盡快購置兒童束縛設備。

市民可參閱運輸署兒童束縛設備專頁（www.td.gov.hk/tc/road_safety/crd）、Agent T Facebook專頁懶人包，以及消費者委員會《選擇》月刊相關文章，了解法例要求和選購要點，或致電署方熱線2804 2600查詢。"
特區政府強烈譴責和反對英國「香港半年報告」,2025-10-24 01:47,2025-10-24 02:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400020.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十月二十四日）就英國發表所謂「香港半年報告：二○二五年一月至六月」中對香港特區各方面情況的失實言論和污衊抹黑，表示強烈譴責，並必須嚴厲直斥其非。

特區政府發言人說：「特區政府強烈譴責和反對英國通過所謂半年報告就香港事務說長道短，肆意以政治凌駕法治，妄圖以政治卑劣技倆干預香港依法施政。香港特區是中華人民共和國不可分離的部分，是一個在『一國兩制』下享有高度自治權、直轄於中央人民政府的地方行政區域。《中英聯合聲明》的核心要義是中國恢復對香港行使主權，沒有賦予英國干預回歸後香港事務的權利。英國對回歸後的香港無主權、無治權，也無監督權。特區政府再次強烈敦促英國認清事實，遵從國際法和國際關係的基本準則，立即停止干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」

保障權利和自由

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府堅定維護香港市民受到法律保障的權利和自由。自香港回歸祖國以來，人權一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》亦清楚訂明香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港，有關言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威的權利和自由。然而，和世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》亦清楚訂明，在有必要保障國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，可以依法限制部分權利和自由。《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條更清楚指出，新聞從業員必須遵守及執行「特別責任和義務」，包括保障國家安全或公共秩序。」

「事實上，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，本港的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。與世界其他地方一樣，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障，這點在英國法院判例中亦受到認可。」

維護國家安全相關法律

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府強烈反對英國所謂報告中針對香港特區維護國家安全相關法律的無稽和失實內容。根據《聯合國憲章》為基礎的國際法及國際關係，每個國家都會制定維護國家安全法律，這既是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。在維護國家安全方面的法律，英國最少有14部，英國政府卻將香港特區執法、檢控和司法機關依法履行職責抹黑為『損害民主權利和自由』，並繼續肆無忌憚扭曲事實加以抨擊，此舉正好顯示出其一向霸凌的行徑，實在極其醜陋、令人不齒。」

「中央二○二○年果斷制定《香港國安法》，特區政府隨即公布實施，填補了香港特區維護國家安全法律制度和執行機制的短板漏洞，效果立竿見影，止暴制亂，讓香港居民重新享有在黑暴期間被剝奪的權利和自由。《香港國安法》的公布實施成為香港『由亂到治』的分水嶺，『一法安香江』。在二○二四年，香港特區切實履行憲制責任訂立《維護國家安全條例》，完善了特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。英國不但歪曲事實、顛倒是非，亦全然漠視香港特區立法的憲制責任和實際需要，以及維護國家安全相關法律訂立後，對經濟發展和人權保障所帶來的正面效果。」

「事實上，《香港國安法》實施五年多以來，讓廣大香港市民生活和經濟活動迅速回復正常，營商環境得以恢復並不斷提升。根據《世界經濟自由度2025年度報告》，香港繼續獲評為全球最自由經濟體；香港在《2025年世界競爭力年報》的排名躍升兩位至全球第三；香港在全球國際金融中心中位列三甲，並在今年首三季首次公開招股集資額位居全球首位；香港在《2024年法治指數》的排名在全球142個國家和地區中位列23，整體排名維持高位，並繼續領先於一些不時無理批評香港法治和人權狀況的歐美國家。這些國際認可的成就都是建基於《香港國安法》及其他特區相關法律和維護國家安全工作為香港社會帶來的自由、安穩。」

「香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關人士或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與涉事人士或組織的政治立場、背景或職業無關。所有案件均是嚴格根據證據和依照法律處理；所有被告均嚴格按照香港適用法律（包括《香港國安法》），並在《基本法》及《香港人權法案》的保障下接受公平審訊。任何倡議某些人或組織不應就其違法行為承擔其法律後果，等同給予其犯法特權，這完全違反法治精神。」

「《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》下的罪行訂有適當的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區一致。香港警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛藏境外的潛逃者被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，肆意勾結外部勢力包庇其惡行。警方採取一切合法措施，強烈打擊有關潛逃行為，做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。包括英國等不少國家也會就不同的通緝犯施行措施打擊潛逃行為，然而英國在特區政府提出相關措施後，詆毀盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區，實乃典型的虛偽『雙標』。」

「留意到所謂的報告中特別提及到『黎智英案』及其他危害國家安全案件，特區政府已多次強調，由於有關案件所涉及的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不應評論有關案件以圖干預法院獨立進行審判，否則可能構成妨礙司法公正。英國必須立即停止繼續顛倒是非、公然抹黑香港特區的司法制度和審訊，企圖美化犯罪行為及向特區法院施壓。」

經完善的選舉制度

特區政府發言人指出：「經完善的香港特區選舉制度為全面落實『愛國者治港』原則提供法律保障，確保政權掌握在愛國者手中是世界通行的政治原則，任何國家或地區的人民均不會容許政權落入不愛國甚或出賣自己國家的人手中。在香港，任何背景人士，只要符合愛國者的要求和具體標準，都可以依法參加選舉，並在成功獲選後進入香港特區管治架構，為香港市民服務。」

維護司法公正和法治精神

特區政府發言人指出：「特區政府維護獨立的司法權，全力支持司法機構依法獨立行使審判權，維護司法公正和法治精神。《基本法》第二條、第十九條及第八十五條訂明，香港特區享有獨立的司法權和終審權，法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉。《基本法》第九十二條亦明文說明香港特區的法官和其他司法人員，應根據其本人的司法和專業才能選用。所有法官和司法人員須得到由本地法官和法律界人士及其他方面的知名人士組成的獨立委員會推薦，並由行政長官任命。所有獲任命的法官和司法人員會繼續緊守司法誓言，奉公守法，以無懼、無偏、無私、無欺之精神，嚴格根據法律原則，維持司法公義。建立香港特區維護國家安全的機制不會損害獨立司法權，香港特區司法制度亦繼續受《基本法》保障。法官在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，一如其他案件，都是獨立公正地履行司法職責，不受任何干涉。五年來的實踐證明，法院嚴格按照上述原則處理涉及《香港國安法》的案件。」

「律政司按《基本法》第六十三條主管刑事檢控工作，不受任何干涉，所有檢控決定是基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析後作出。再者，《香港國安法》第五條及《維護國家安全條例》第2條亦明確訂明，防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪時，應當堅持法治原則。」

「香港特區司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。法院嚴格按照證據和所有適用法律判案，案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同；而控方有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人犯罪，被告人才可被法庭定罪。」

加強國民教育

特區政府發言人指出：「學校是學生學習和成長的地方，學校有責任提供安全有序的校園環境和氛圍，防止政治干預或違法活動入侵校園，以保障學生福祉。國民教育一直是香港中小學及幼稚園課程重要部分，以加強學生對國情、歷史和文化、《憲法》和《基本法》、以及國家安全的認識，建立文化自信，提升國民身分認同，培育他們成為德才兼備，有承擔、有視野、愛國愛港的新一代。此外，教師是學生的重要楷模，肩負知識傳承、熏陶品德的重要職責，特區政府有責任確保教師的專業操守。實施包括國家安全教育在內的國民教育，是世界各地教育當局正當合理的責任，不同地方對實施國家安全教育及培養學生國民身分，包括對各自的憲法、自身歷史、文化、地理等知識，均十分重視。」

「學術自由是香港一直推崇的重要社會價值，亦是香港高等教育界賴以成功的基石。自《香港國安法》實施以來，本港學者和專上院校繼續與境外和校外合作夥伴進行正常交流活動。同時，本地專上院校已採取一系列措施，將國家安全教育納入學生的學習範圍，以履行其法定責任。各院校在課程設計上享有自主，特區政府鼓勵其就國家安全教育為學生提供多元化的學習機會。」"
HKSAR Government strongly condemns and rejects the UK six-monthly report on Hong Kong,2025-10-24 01:47,2025-10-24 02:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400022.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) strongly reprimanded and must resolutely refute the untruthful remarks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the HKSAR in the so-called six-monthly report on Hong Kong: January to June 2025 of the United Kingdom (UK) today (October 24).

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""The HKSAR Government strongly condemns and rejects the UK's attempt through a so-called six-monthly report to make misleading and irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong matters, wantonly put politics above the rule of law and attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance by despicable political manoeuvres. The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, and as a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the principle of 'one country, two systems', comes directly under the jurisdiction of the Central People's Government. The core essence of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is about China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. It did not authorise the UK to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs after its return to the motherland. The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of supervision over Hong Kong after its return to the motherland. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the UK again to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.""

Safeguarding rights and freedoms

The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) also clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc. Indeed, Article 19 of the ICCPR specifically requires that journalists must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities' including protection of national security or public order.""

""In fact, since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO, the media landscape in Hong Kong has remained vibrant. Like all other places in the world, freedom of the press and speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. The media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise government policies without any restriction, as long as this is not in violation of the law. The most crucial point, which is also recognized in the judgments of the courts of the United Kingdom, is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.""

Laws safeguarding national security

The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government strongly opposes the absurd and false contents in the UK's so-called six-monthly report with regard to the laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR. In accordance with international law and international practice based on the Charter of the United Nations, it is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. With at least 14 pieces of laws safeguarding national security in the UK, the UK Government vilified the HKSAR law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial authorities' performance of their duties in accordance with the law as 'undermining the rights and freedoms', and continued to unscrupulously distort the facts to criticize, which just shows its bullying act are utterly ugly and despicable.""

""In 2020, the Central Authorities decisively enacted the HKNSL and the HKSAR Government soon afterwards promulgated it for implementation. The HKNSL has addressed the shortcomings and plugged the loopholes in the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security of the HKSAR. Its effect in stopping violence and curbing disorder was immediate, and has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence. The implementation of HKNSL was a 'watershed moment' in Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order, as stability and safety of the city have been restored by the law. In 2024, the HKSAR fulfilled its constitutional duty by enacting the SNSO, thereby improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. Those remarks by the UK are not only totally distorting and confounding right and wrong, but they also entirely disregard the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and protection of human rights.""

""In fact, the implementation of the HKNSL in the past five years or so has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly resume to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. According to the âEconomic Freedom of the World 2025 Annual Report, Hong Kong has once again been ranked as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres and comes first in the world in terms of funds raised through initial public offerings in the first three quarters of 2025. Hong Kong ranks the 23rd out of 142 countries and jurisdictions globally in 2024 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, and remains high in the overall ranking and continues to be ahead of some European and American countries which often unreasonably criticise the rule of law and human rights situation of Hong Kong. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security.""

""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that 'laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable'. Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation. All cases are handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law. All defendants will receive fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong (including the HKNSL) and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.""

""Appropriate extraterritorial effect for the offences under the HKNSL and the SNSO fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Hong Kong Police are duty-bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security outside Hong Kong. Those absconders hiding outside Hong Kong are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security. Moreover, they continue to collude with external forces to cover for their evil deeds. It is necessary for the Police to take all lawful measures to strongly combat the acts of abscondment, and such actions are fully justified, necessary and legitimate. Quite a number of countries including the UK would also impose measures on wanted criminals to combat the acts of abscondment. It is indeed a demonstration of hypocrisy with double standards by the UK with ulterior motives that, after the HKSAR Government has announced the relevant measures, attack the HKSAR in safeguarding national security dutifully, faithfully and in accordance with the law.""

""We noticed that the so-called report specifically mentioned the case of Lai Chee-ying and other cases on offences endangering national security. The HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that as the legal proceedings involving the concerned cases are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the case in an attempt to interfere with the court to exercise judicial power independently, which might otherwise constitute perverting the course of justice. The UK must stop distorting the truth, blatantly discrediting the judicial system and trials of the HKSAR, in an attempt to glorify criminal behavior and exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR.""

Improved electoral system

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The improved electoral system of the HKSAR puts in place legal safeguards to ensure the full implementation of 'patriots administering Hong Kong'. Keeping political power in the hands of patriots is a political rule commonly adopted around the world. No one in any country or region in the world will ever allow political power to fall into the hands of forces or individuals who do not love, or even sell out or betray, their own country. In Hong Kong, regardless of one's background, whoever meets the requirements and criteria of patriots can participate in elections in accordance with the law and serve the Hong Kong public by entering into the governance structure of the HKSAR after getting successfully elected.""

Safeguarding due administration of justice and rule of law 

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government safeguards independent judicial power and fully supports the Judiciary in exercising its judicial power independently, safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law. Articles 2, 19 and 85 of the Basic Law specifically provide that the HKSAR enjoys independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication, and the courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. Article 92 of the Basic Law also clearly stipulates that judges and other members of the judiciary of the HKSAR shall be chosen on the basis of their judicial and professional qualities. All judges and judicial officers are appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of an independent commission composed of local judges, persons from the legal profession and eminent persons from other sectors. All judges and judicial officers so appointed will continue to abide by the Judicial Oath and administer justice in full accordance with the law, without fear or favour, self-interest or deceit. Establishing the mechanism for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR will not undermine the independent judicial power. Our judicial system continues to be protected by the Basic Law. When adjudicating cases concerning offence endangering national security, as in any other cases, judges remain independent and impartial in performing their judicial duties, free from any interference. The implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven that the courts have handled all the cases involving the HKNSL strictly in accordance with the above principles.""

""The Department of Justice takes charge of criminal prosecutions, free from any interference by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law. All prosecutorial decisions are based on an objective analysis of all admissible evidence and applicable laws. In addition, Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security.""

""The Judiciary exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or background of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.""

Enhancing national education

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""Schools are places for students to learn and grow. It is the obligation of schools to provide a safe and orderly school environment and atmosphere, and to maintain a campus free from political interference or illegal activities, for safeguarding students' well-being. National education has been an important part of the curriculum for primary and secondary schools as well as kindergartens, for deepening our students' understanding of the country's development, the history and culture, the Constitution and the Basic Law, as well as national security, thereby building up cultural confidence to foster a sense of national identity, and cultivating them into an able and virtuous new generation with a sense of responsibility, visions and love for the country and the city. Teachers are also important role models of their students, playing a vital role in passing on knowledge and nurturing students' character. The HKSAR Government has the responsibility to ensure the professional conduct of teachers. Implementation of national education, including national security education, is the legitimate duty of education authorities all over the world. Different places attach great importance to implementing national security education and developing their students' sense of national identity, including knowledge of their respective constitution, their own history, culture, geography, etc.""

""Academic freedom is an important social value treasured in Hong Kong and the cornerstone of our higher education sector. Since the implementation of the National Security Law, academics or post-secondary education institutions in Hong Kong continue to conduct normal exchange activities with their foreign or external counterparts. Meanwhile, post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong have taken a series of measures to incorporate national security education into students' learning in fulfilment of their statutory duty. These institutions enjoy autonomy on curriculum design, and the HKSAR Government encourages the institutions to provide students with diversified learning opportunities on national security education."""

CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as four severe paediatric influenza infection cases were recorded within four days,2025-10-23 20:44,2025-10-23 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300886.htm,"ããThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 23) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case, the fourth this week. The CHP urged schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

ããThe case involves a 14-year-old girl with good past health. She has developed a fever, cough and shortness of breath since October 21. She attended Princess Margaret Hospital today and was admitted to its paediatric intensive care unit. She is currently in serious condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with shock. The girl had not received the 2025/26 SIV yet. Her household contacts are currently asymptomatic and no influenza outbreaks have been reported at her school recently.

ããIncluding today's case, 14 severe paediatric influenza cases, including one fatal case, involving children aged 2 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year in September. Among them, 11 had good past health.

ãã""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season, and the influenza activity remains high. The CHP's latest surveillance data showed that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses during the past week (October 12 to 18) was 11.84 per cent, similar to the 12.02 per cent recorded during the preceding week. It exceeds the peak of 10.54 per cent during the winter influenza season earlier this year. Influenza A (H3) is the predominant circulating strain, accounting for nearly 90 per cent of all detected viruses, followed by influenza A (H1) accounting for nearly 10 per cent. Influenza B accounted for the remainder. The influenza admission rate in public hospitals is 0.78 cases per 10 000 population, similar to the 0.77 cases recorded during the preceding week. There has also been a continual increase in outbreaks of influenza-like illness in schools and Residential Care Homes (RCHs). As of yesterday (October 22), 608 outbreaks had been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September. Among them, 65, 323 and 220 cases occurred in kindergartens/child care centres, primary schools and secondary schools respectively,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

ãã""Based on the current level of influenza activity and trend analysis, the local influenza activity is expected to remain at a relatively high level over the next few weeks. Furthermore, viruses tend to become more active when temperatures drop. The winter influenza season in Hong Kong typically occurs between January and March. The current summer influenza season may overlap with the upcoming winter influenza season, which could lead to more hospitalisations due to influenza infection than in previous years. I urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV, to act promptly, particularly those high-risk groups such as the elderly, children, and adults with underlying illnesses and immunosuppression. Members of the public may also contact their family doctors to arrange for vaccinations,"" he added.

ããMembers of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to the Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

 Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

 In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

The FEHD also reminds the public that the newly commissioned Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance in Sha Tin has established a ""smoke-free worship"" environment. The burning of joss sticks and paper offerings is strictly prohibited throughout the premises. The public is encouraged to pay tribute with fresh flowers instead of traditional offerings.

  The newly constructed Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance at On Hing Lane, Shek Mun in Sha Tin commenced operations on September 26. With an area of about 24 000 square metres, the facility provides approximately 40 000 niches, a Garden of Remembrance for ash scattering covering about 3 110 square metres in area, and a Garden of Forever Love with 300 spaces for the placement of abortuses under 24 weeks of gestation. The services are now open for public application.

  To ensure effective enforcement of the ""smoke-free worship"" requirement, the FEHD has introduced robots equipped with artificial intelligence to serve as ""Smoke-free Ambassadors"" and ""Service Ambassadors"". ""Smoke-Free Ambassadors"" conduct daily patrols and will immediately alert staff and issue real-time broadcast warning messages to visitors upon detecting smoke or flames. Meanwhile, ""Service Ambassadors"" deliver mobile customer service and broadcasting information to visitors.

  The architectural design of the Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance fully utilises the natural terrain and environmental features of the site. Plants and trees are arranged as natural barriers through landscape design, allowing the facilities to blend harmoniously with the surroundings, creating a tranquil, solemn and people-oriented environment that is both comfortable and convenient for the public.

  The columbarium building adopts sustainable architectural design principles, incorporating natural lighting to minimise the impact on the natural landscape. The design features include a piazza, solar panels, a green rooftop and a rainwater recycling system for irrigation. The facility is also equipped with various energy-efficient installations and renewable energy technologies. Auxiliary facilities such as crutch hooks at service counters, baby care rooms, and barrier-free facilities are provided to cater to the diverse needs of visitors.

  The FEHD has long been committed to promoting green burials and encouraging environmentally friendly handling of cremated ashes. The Shek Mun Garden of Remembrance features ash scattering lawns themed with various flowers and trees to create a natural landscape, complemented by commemorative plaques that offer visitors a serene and peaceful environment to mourn their beloved ones. The site also includes farewell and memorial facilities, such as a ceremonial room adorned with floral installations themed on ""Four Seasons"", allowing families to conduct simple remembrance rituals prior to ash scattering. Additionally, the Serenity Pond, a Chinese-style imitation of a stone-textured water feature located beside the Garden of Remembrance and Garden of Forever Love, is piloting a memorial experience named ""Connect by Folding"". Family members and friends may write blessings for the deceased on flower-shaped paper, fold them, and place them into the water as a symbolic gesture to express remembrance and affection for the deceased.

  For more information about the Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance, please visit the FEHD webpage www.fehd.gov.hk.

  Furthermore, the FEHD officially commissioned a Garden of Remembrance at the Sandy Ridge Cemetery yesterday (October 22), designated for the scattering of ashes from unclaimed bodies. Four pebble-paved trenches allow FEHD staff to scatter unclaimed ashes in a dignified manner. Commemorative plaques inscribed with the corresponding year and memorial facilities are also provided for public tribute and remembrance."

CE warmly congratulates victorious conclusion of Fourth Plenary Session of 20th CPC Central Committee,2025-10-23 20:00,2025-10-23 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300825.htm,"âThe Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC Central Committee) concluded in Beijing today (October 23). The session adopted the Recommendations of the CPC Central Committee for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, extended his warmest congratulations on the victorious conclusion of the session. He said that the session holds great significance, as this year marks the conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan period and the preparatory year for the 15th Five-Year Plan.

The communique of the session stated that the session gave a highly positive assessment of the country's major achievements in development during the 14th Five-Year Plan period and outlined the main goals for economic and social development during the 15th Five-Year Plan period. The session emphasised the need to unite in a concerted endeavour to accomplish the 15th Five-Year Plan; to promote the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao; to promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and the cause of national reunification; and to contribute to the building of a global community of shared future. The session also pointed out that thoroughly studying and implementing the spirit of the session is a major political task for the entire Party and the country, both at present and in the near future.

Mr Lee was deeply inspired and encouraged by the victorious conclusion of the Fourth Plenary Session of 20th CPC Central Committee. He noted that, despite the accelerating global changes unseen in a century during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, the country has solidly strived for high-quality development, achieving groundbreaking progress, transformative changes and historic accomplishments in economic and social development. Furthermore, the country has further deepened reform comprehensively, making impressive achievements that drew global attention. The recommendations for the 15th Five-Year Plan adopted at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee will provide a top-level design and strategic blueprint for the country's development over the next five years and are of great significance and impact to Hong Kong.

""Under the 'one country, two systems' principle, Hong Kong enjoys the unique advantage of having the strong support of the country while being closely connected to the world. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, Hong Kong has been actively integrating into national development and playing an important role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder' for the world. The 15th Five-Year Plan period is crucial for the nation in building a great country and moving toward national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernisation. It also coincides with a critical period when the implementation of 'one country, two systems' enters a new stage and Hong Kong accelerates its progression from governance to prosperity. In the face of profound and complex changes in the circumstances for development, where strategic opportunities coexist with risks and challenges with increasing uncertainties and unpredictable factors, Hong Kong will identify and focus on its advantageous positioning in the country's development blueprint, proactively align with the chapters on Hong Kong and Macao in the 15th Five-Year Plan, seize the significant opportunities brought about by the country's development, and leverage its own unique advantages in national development. All sectors of the Hong Kong community should earnestly study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, give full play to the strength and value of 'patriots administering Hong Kong' and, in the nation's continuous progress of building a great country and moving toward national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernisation, fulfil Hong Kong's responsibilities, seize Hong Kong's opportunities and make Hong Kong's contributions,"" Mr Lee said."

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的14歲女童。她在十月二十一日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和氣促，今日到瑪嘉烈醫院求醫，獲安排在兒童深切治療部留醫，目前情況嚴重。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克。女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，她就讀的學校近日亦沒有出現流感爆發的情況。

計及今日的最新一宗個案，由九月開學至今，有14宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎2至17歲，其中11人過往的健康狀況良好。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港現時正處於夏季流感季節，流感活躍程度維持在高水平。中心最新監測數據顯示，過去一周（十月十二至十八日），呼吸道樣本中流感病毒檢測呈陽性的百分比為11.84%，與前一周錄得的12.02%相若，並已超越今年初冬季流感季節最高一周的10.54%。目前主要流行的病毒為甲型（H3）流感，佔整體病毒檢測接近九成，其次為甲型（H1）流感，佔接近一成，餘下則為乙型流感。公立醫院住院病人被診斷為流感的入院率為每一萬人有0.78宗入院個案，與前一周的0.77宗相若。學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發個案持續上升，截至昨日（十月二十二日），自九月開學以來，涉及學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案共有608宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（65宗）、小學（323宗）及中學（220宗）。」

他續說:「按目前流感活躍程度和趨勢分析，流感活躍程度在未來幾星期預計會維持在較高水平。另一方面，氣溫下降，病毒一般會較活躍。香港的冬季流感季節大多在一月至三月期間出現，今次夏季流感季節有可能與下一個冬季流感重疊，導致因感染流感而住院的人數較以往更多。我呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動，特別是高風險群組，例如長者、兒童，及患有慢性疾病和免疫抑制的成年人。市民亦可以聯絡自己家庭醫生安排接種。」

市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

徐樂堅醫生提醒高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-23 19:40,2025-10-23 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300829.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 23), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

 The case involves a 52-year-old male living in Kwun Tong District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Foshan in Guangdong alone between October 17 and 21. He developed joint pain since October 21. He sought medical attention at a private hospital on October 22 and Kwun Tong Family Medicine Integrated Centre on October 23. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition.

 The patient has one household contact, who is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 43 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. Among which, a patient passed away, while conditions of other patients are mild.

  Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-23 19:40,2025-10-23 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300826.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十三日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

個案涉及一名52歲男子，住所位於觀塘區。初步調查顯示，他於十月十七日至二十一日獨自到訪廣東省佛山市。他於十月二十一日出現關節痛，並於十月二十二日和二十三日先後到私家醫院和觀塘家庭醫學綜合中心求醫。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。

他有一名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於他在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得43宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。當中一名患者死亡，其餘患者病況輕微。

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：
• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：
• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

Peter (Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Dr Peter Lam), Allan (Representative of the Bordeaux Wine Council, Mr Allan Sichel), ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. A big welcome to the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival, the 13th happy edition!

We have all the ingredients for four fabulous days and nights of wining and dining under the sun and the stars. And this year, ladies and gentlemen, you can party until midnight every night.

I'm told some 150 000 people, from Hong Kong, the Mainland, the Asian region and around the world will take part in this year's Wine & Dine Festival, here to enjoy the stunning, harbour-side setting and the wide range of international and local offerings.

As the Chief Executive announced in his recent Policy Address, this year's Wine & Dine Festival is an enhanced version. More than 300 fine wine and food booths, from 31 countries and regions, are here - waiting for you and your taste buds. It's all part of the Government's efforts to showcase Hong Kong as an international culinary hub. Something we clearly don’t have to tell you.

As Peter noted, this year's Festival welcomes the return of the Grand Wine Pavilion, featuring more than 100 exceptional Old and New World wines chosen by renowned wine critic James Suckling, and offering you a rare opportunity to sample hand-picked wines and enjoy a refined tasting experience.

And, yes, Gourmet Avenue is back and bigger than ever. A dozen of this city’s top restaurants - counting 13 Michelin stars and seven Black Pearl diamonds among them - will serve up Cantonese, Chinese, French, Nordic-Japanese, pizza and more, all in one place.

Then there's the Tasting Room, where five celebrated chefs from around the world come together in a special collaboration.

I know you will enjoy it all, ladies and gentlemen. Every last memorable bite, bottle and moment of this year's Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival.

Once you have enjoyed the food and wine, we invite you to take some time to explore the rest of Hong Kong. Our city truly has it all. You can discover our vibrant arts and cultural scene, explore our rich heritage, relax in our beautiful country parks, have fun at our world-class theme parks, or enjoy fantastic shopping. There is always so much more to see and do.

My thanks to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the Bordeaux Wine Council, and all the many devoted organisers and sponsors who have contributed to the success of this spectacular festival. Together, we are making Hong Kong a true gathering place for food and wine lovers from all over the world.

And while you are enjoying the vibrant life of our city, I would like to take this opportunity to call upon all of you from Hong Kong to cast your votes in the upcoming Legislative Council election to be held on December 7. By casting your vote, you can play a part in shaping the future of this community we all love. Let us elect a team of patriotic, capable, and dedicated legislators who will work tirelessly to serve the people of Hong Kong and contribute to our country.

Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the party, beautiful Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong, the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. That certainly includes fine food and wine enjoyed in the very best of company. Cheers!"

Hong Kong Customs detects two incoming passenger drug trafficking cases at airport (with photos),2025-10-23 18:28,2025-10-23 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300585.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected two drug trafficking cases involving incoming passengers at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (October 22) and seized a total of about 16 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with a total estimated market value of about $3.2 million.

The first case involved a male passenger, aged 24, who arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 8kg of suspected cannabis buds from 16 vacuum-sealed plastic bags inside his check-in suitcase. The estimated market value was about $1.6 million. The man was subsequently arrested.

In the second case, a 35-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, on the same day. During customs clearance, Customs officers found 8kg of suspected cannabis buds from 17 vacuum-sealed plastic bags inside his check-in suitcase. The estimated market value was about $1.6 million. The man was subsequently arrested.

After an investigation, the two arrested men have each been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and the cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 24).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

行政長官熱烈祝賀中國共產黨第二十屆中央委員會第四次全體會議勝利閉幕,2025-10-23 18:20,2025-10-23 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300768.htm,"中國共產黨第二十屆中央委員會第四次全體會議（二十屆四中全會）今日（十月二十三日）於北京閉幕，全會審議通過了《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》（「十五五」建議）。行政長官李家超熱烈祝賀二十屆四中全會勝利閉幕，表示這是在國家「十四五」規劃收官、「十五五」規劃謀篇布局的關鍵節點召開的一次重要會議，意義重大。

二十屆四中全會公報指出，全會高度評價「十四五」時期國家發展取得的重大成就，並提出了「十五五」時期經濟社會發展的主要目標。全會強調，要團結起來為實現「十五五」規劃而奮鬥；促進香港、澳門長期繁榮穩定，推動兩岸關係和平發展、推進祖國統一大業，推動構建人類命運共同體。全會又指出，學習好貫徹好全會精神是當前和今後一個時期全黨全國的重大政治任務。

李家超對此感到鼓舞和振奮，表示在國家「十四五」期間，世界百年變局加速演進，但國家扎實推動高質量發展，經濟社會發展取得新的開創性進展、突破性變革、歷史性成就，並進一步全面深化改革，取得舉世矚目的成就。二十屆四中全會通過的「十五五」建議，為國家未來五年的發展作出了頂層設計和戰略擘畫，更對香港有重大影響和啓示。

李家超表示：「『一國兩制』下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢。在『十四五』時期，香港積極融入國家發展大局，發揮着聯通世界的『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的重要角色。『十五五』時期對國家以中國式現代化全面推進強國建設、民族復興偉業十分關鍵，也正值『一國兩制』實踐邁入新階段、香港加快實現『由治及興』的重要時期。面對發展環境深刻複雜變化，戰略機遇和風險挑戰並存、不確定難預料因素增多，香港會在國家發展藍圖中找準優勢定位，主動對接『十五五』規劃港澳篇章，把握國家發展帶來的重大機遇，在國家發展大局中發揮自身的獨特優勢。香港社會各界要認真學習好和貫徹好二十屆四中全會精神，發揮好『愛國者治港』的力量和價值，在國家不斷開創以中國式現代化全面推進強國建設、民族復興偉業新局面的進程中履行香港責任、把握香港機遇、作出香港貢獻。」"

大家好！今天很高興來到香港科學館，參與 「中國銀行（香港）呈獻︰國家發展成就系列──臻至完美：運動與科學的交匯」展覽開幕典禮。

首次由粵港澳三地共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會），將分別於今年十一月和十二月舉行。這是香港首次參與承辦的全國體育盛事，特區政府的各個部門積極準備、通力合作，力求將此次體育賽事辦成一個簡約、安全、精彩的盛會，並鼓勵市民以不同方式參與，燃燒起他們對運動的熱情。

為響應二○二五年全運會，今次展覽以「臻至完美：運動與科學的交匯」為主題，介紹國家體育事業的輝煌成就，展示創新科技如何協助運動員取得非凡佳績，並鼓勵大眾養成健康積極的生活方式。展覽簡介了全運會的歷史及港區賽事的項目，以科學剖析不同運動項目及其致勝關鍵。這個展覽有很高的參與性，透過逾20組的互動展品，觀眾可親身體驗多項運動項目的精粹，例如欖球的旋轉、沙灘排球的跳躍、場地單車的速度、高爾夫球的準繩、劍擊的進攻以及籃球的防守等。展場的「動感生活」專區更讓一家大小共同參與多種體適能活動，了解自己的身體機能，感受運動的樂趣。展覽亦會展示本地運動員的獎牌和裝備，讓巿民體會他們努力不懈、追求卓越的體育精神。展覽期間還會安排運動員分享心路歷程，以及有一系列的教育活動。

今次展覽是國家發展成就系列的第二個展覽，讓市民在參與這場體育盛事的同時，亦可從中認識國家在體育發展方面的卓越成就。體育發展不僅充滿由運動員的汗水和努力所成就的傳奇故事，亦是凝聚人心、激發夢想的文化傳承，更直接關係到普羅大眾的身心健康。我希望這次展覽，可以引發市民多參與體育活動，培養健康生活方式。

今次展覽得以順利舉行，我謹代表特區政府感謝中國銀行（香港）有限公司的慷慨贊助，亦感謝各個提供協助的機構，以及借出運動裝備及獎牌的運動員。希望社會各界繼續支持及熱烈參與十五運會和殘特奧會的各項相關活動，除入場親身支持香港運動員，大家還可以與家人朋友一起來科學館欣賞此次展覽，體驗各種運動項目，感受運動與科學交匯的趣味。

最後，我想為一件關乎香港市民幸福的大事，作出呼籲。高水平、有效運作的立法會，對於推動香港整體發展和提升市民福祉十分重要。第八屆立法會的選舉將在十二月七日舉行，行政長官和選舉委員會主席今早已在立法會換屆選舉啟動禮呼籲大家屆時踴躍參與投票，為香港特區良政善治、長治久安和美好的未來，盡愛國愛港者的責任，貢獻力量。多謝大家。"

海關人員於十月二十一日在香港國際機場截查一名二十九歲抵港男旅客，並在其個人行李內檢獲約二萬零七百支未完稅香煙，市值約九萬三千元，應課稅值約六萬八千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"

Customs officers intercepted the incoming male passenger, aged 29, at Hong Kong International Airport on October 21. About 20 700 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $93,000 and a duty potential of about $68,000, were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

「賽馬會連線啟程計劃」是多方合作的成果，由香港賽馬會慈善信託基金策劃及捐助、懲教署及善導會聯合策劃，並由香港大學擔任知識夥伴。

署理懲教署署長吳超覺在啟動禮上表示，懲教署一直致力加強更生工作，透過適切的更生計劃協助在囚人士改過自新。他感謝社會不同持份者對更生工作的支持。他表示，「賽馬會連線啟程計劃」應用了終止犯罪理論，並將更生服務由懲教院所延伸至社區，有助降低更生人士的重犯機會，重塑奉公守法的新身分，重新連結社會，亦支援他們回饋社會，逐步逆轉人生。

香港賽馬會慈善事務部主管（教育；青年）應鳳秀致辭時說，更生人士若得到適切的協助，能有效減低他們重犯的情況，更可讓他們轉化為社會的人才資本。香港賽馬會希望透過今次的策劃及捐助，以創新的「一條龍」模式，協助短刑期的在囚人士由院所內開始裝備自己，並在獲釋後重建自我，以便更好地融入社會，貢獻香港。

善導會執行委員會主席潘兆童法官致辭時指出，計劃與在囚及更生人士同行，為他們提供從院所到社區的無縫接軌多元支援服務，協助他們訂立目標，並逐步重建與他人的關係，使他們能融入社區，成為貢獻社會的力量。這是一項歷史性的里程碑。

香港大學社會科學學院署任院長方偉晶教授致辭時表示，計劃不僅是一個跨學科合作項目，結合不同範疇的專業知識和研究優勢，為更生人士提供全方位及多角度的支援服務，更是香港首次採用隨機對照組的科學方法評估計劃成效，為更生服務提供寶貴的實證數據，有助未來發展出更多元化及更具成效的更生概念。

「賽馬會連線啟程計劃」將於羅湖懲教所、壁屋監獄、塘福懲教所及大欖懲教所推行，為自願參與而刑期少於一年的在囚人士提供「一條龍」更生服務，當中包括透過專業社工評估，為在囚人士安排合適的個人成長小組活動，協助他們發展個人強項，建立正向價值觀和人生目標，並加強守法意識，從而強化他們改過的決心。此外，計劃亦提供就業相關的協助，並在在囚人士離開院所後持續跟進個案，透過社區活動協助他們建立正向的社交網絡，並順利融入社會。

懲教署更生服務研究組會聯同香港大學展開為期三年的研究，追蹤並研究服務使用者釋放後的更生情況。"
CSD holds Jockey Club Project ReBond kick-off ceremony (with photos),2025-10-23 18:05,2025-10-23 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300605.htm,"âThe Correctional Services Department (CSD) held the Jockey Club Project ReBond kick-off ceremony at Lo Wu Correctional Institution today (October 23), implementing a policy initiative announced by the Chief Executive in the 2025 Policy Address to provide one-stop rehabilitation services for persons in custody (PICs) serving sentences of less than one year, covering both their incarceration and post-release periods, and to track and research their rehabilitation situation.

The Jockey Club Project ReBond is a collaborative initiative created and funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, and co-created by the CSD and SideBySide with the University of Hong Kong serving as the knowledge partner.

Addressing the kick-off ceremony, the Acting Commissioner of Correctional Services, Mr Ng Chiu-kok, said that the CSD has been committed to enhancing its rehabilitative efforts to assist PICs in rehabilitating through appropriate rehabilitation programmes. He expressed gratitude to various stakeholders in society for their support in rehabilitation work. He noted that the project applies the theory of desistance, extending rehabilitation services from correctional institutions to the community. This approach will help reduce recidivism among rehabilitated persons, rebuild their law-abiding identity and reconnect them with society, as well as support them in giving back to society, thereby gradually transforming their lives.

The Head of Charities (Education & Youth Cluster) of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Ms Winnie Ying, in her address said that appropriate assistance for rehabilitated persons can effectively reduce recidivism and transform them into social talent capital. The Hong Kong Jockey Club aims to, through the project and donation, help short-term PICs equip themselves starting from within the correctional institutions and rebuild themselves after release with this innovative one-stop approach, enabling them to better reintegrate into society and contribute to Hong Kong.

In his address, the Chairperson of the Executive Committee of SideBySide, Mr Justice Poon Siu-tung, highlighted that the project seeks to accompany PICs and rehabilitated persons by providing them with seamlessly connected and diversified support services from correctional institutions to the community. It will assist them in setting goals and gradually rebuilding relationships with others, so that they can reintegrate into society and become contributors to the community. This marks a historical milestone.

The Acting Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Hong Kong, Professor Eric Fong, noted that the project is an interdisciplinary collaboration integrating expertise and research strengths across diverse fields to provide comprehensive and multidimensional support services for rehabilitated persons. Moreover, it also marks the first time in Hong Kong that a randomised control group scientific method has been adopted to evaluate the project's effectiveness, providing valuable empirical data for rehabilitation services, which will facilitate the future development of more diverse and effective rehabilitation approaches.

The Jockey Club Project ReBond will be implemented at Lo Wu Correctional Institution, Pik Uk Prison, Tong Fuk Correctional Institution and Tai Lam Correctional Institution. It provides one-stop rehabilitation services for voluntary participants serving sentences of less than one year. These include arranging suitable personal growth group activities for PICs to develop personal strengths, establish positive values and life goals, and strengthen their law-abiding awareness through assessments by professional social workers, thereby reinforcing their resolve to rehabilitate. Additionally, the project offers employment-related assistance and continues to follow up on the cases after their release from the correctional institutions. Through community activities, it helps PICs establish positive social networks and facilitates their successful reintegration into society.

Under the project, the Correctional Rehabilitation Research Unit of the CSD will collaborate with the University of Hong Kong to conduct a three-year study to track and research the rehabilitation situation of service users after their release."

Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in September 2025 was 1.0%, slightly smaller than that in August 2025 (1.1%).

On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of increase in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending September 2025 was 0.3%, the same as that for the 3-month period ending August 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of increase were 0.1% and 0.2%.

Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.5%, 0.9% and 0.8% respectively in September 2025, as compared to 1.5%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively in August 2025.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending September 2025, the average monthly rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.3%, 0.2% and 0.2% respectively. The corresponding rates of increase for the 3-month period ending August 2025 were 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.3% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of increase in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending September 2025 were all 0.1%, and the corresponding rates of increase for the 3-month period ending August 2025 were all 0.2%.

Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in September 2025 for transport (2.2%), alcoholic drinks and tobacco (2.0%), housing (1.7%), miscellaneous services (1.6%), meals out and takeaway food (1.2%), miscellaneous goods (0.4%), and electricity, gas and water (0.4%).

On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in September 2025 for clothing and footwear (-3.7%), and durable goods (-3.1%).

As for basic food, the Composite CPI in September 2025 remained unchanged over a year earlier.

Taking the first 9 months of 2025 together, the Composite CPI rose by 1.5% over a year earlier. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.0%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.5%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.0%, 1.4%, 0.9% and 0.8% respectively.

For the 12 months ending September 2025, the Composite CPI was on average 1.5% higher than that in the preceding 12-month period. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.2%, 1.5%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation remained modest in September. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.0% over a year earlier, broadly similar to the increases in recent months. Price pressures across major components were largely stable.

Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay modest in the near term, as domestic cost pressures remain contained and external price pressures are subdued.

主席：

我感謝陳學鋒議員提出的議案和四位議員提出的修正案。我們剛才亦聽取了各議員具前瞻性及啓發性的意見。接下來，我會就環境及生態局及轄下部門的範疇作出綜合回應。

保育自然生態及鄉郊旅遊發展

政府一直在尊重生態及保護環境的前提下，推動鄉郊旅遊，適度向訪客展現香港擁有的珍貴生態資源，同時盡量減低過多訪客可能對環境帶來的潛在影響，平衡保育和發展的需要。

我在開場發言時簡介了香港多姿多采的生態及鄉郊旅遊資源，以及結合鄉郊文化和漁農歷史文化的各式各樣別具特色的活動。我們希望多元化的選擇有助分流訪客，以及宣傳教育可令訪客珍惜這些資源並重視郊遊禮儀，包括愛護大自然及動植物和踐行「自己垃圾、自己帶走」。

有議員提及其他地方的經驗，例如北海道。政府致力為生態遊熱門地點提供適切的配套。在北部都會區內，未來亦會有若干具潛力的生態遊熱門地點。以三寶樹濕地公園為例，我們會在妥善保護生態和濕地生境的大前提下，適切地提供旅遊設施，包括步道、觀鳥設施、訪客中心、生態旅舍，以及交通配套等。

本地漁農美食

有議員提到，除發展休閒漁農業外，政府亦應推廣本地漁農美食。為進一步加強推廣本地漁農產品，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）計劃在二○二六年年中推出漁農產品統一新品牌，涵蓋各類本地漁農產品，並制定生產標準，以確保品質。漁護署與魚類統營處亦會積極透過不同渠道拓展本地銷售網絡。在二○二五年十月六日舉行的食物安全及環境衛生事務委員會的會議上，有議員列舉多種本地漁農產品，並盛讚由其烹製而成的佳餚。

便利措施

就議員關心的便利措施，鄉郊保育辦公室曾促成荔枝窩的民宿項目和梅子林的營地項目，以及協助在谷埔及西貢鹽田梓的個案成功取得食物業牌照。

政府透過這些寶貴經驗及跨部門合作，就位於92條偏遠鄉郊村落，制定了有關申請賓館及食物業牌照的便利措施，正如在開場發言提到，政府擬在二○二五年第四季公布申請指引，各部門就其管轄範疇處理相關申請時，會落實該指引內的相關便利措施，而鄉郊保育辦公室會繼續其給予意見的角色。

至於在鄉郊設置臨時攤位售賣傳統小食，例如茶粿，或簡單的食品和飲品，例如咖啡，該指引也載列了便利措施，讓該92條鄉郊村落的有興趣人士可簡便地申領牌照，獲發牌照者可在牌照適用期間於合規格處所製作及售賣前述的食品和飲品。

旅遊管理

有議員提到有關東壩和橋咀洲的觀察。政務司司長領導各部門做好迎接黃金周的各項安排，包括交通配套、人流管制、秩序安全、環境衞生、宣傳教育等，藉此讓訪客感受到良好的體驗。整體情況達到預期的成效。

政府亦適時在個別地點作出適切跟進，例如跨部門行動、宣傳教育及執管工作，當中包括加強勸喻持份者，傳達保護生態，愛護海洋生物，以及如何進行負責任的浮潛活動等信息。

往後，政府仍會繼續在有需要的日子預早部署應對工作。正如我在開場發言時所述，就熱門地點，漁護署正持續監察情況，適時檢視其訪客承載量，以及按需要靈活應用管理策略；此外亦正進行研究，以評估有否需要進一步加強未來的跟進工作。該研究包括考慮把一些重要的生態地點納入法定保護範圍的需要及可行性。

結語

我們會繼續以可持續方式推廣生態及鄉郊旅遊，並提供各種自然教育活動，使訪客在欣賞和享受大自然的同時，亦提升其保護生態及人文資源的意識。

我謹此陳辭。多謝主席。"
Speech by Acting SJ at Greater Bay Area Conference 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-10-23 15:46,2025-10-23 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300600.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the Greater Bay Area Conference 2025 today (October 23):

Mr Zhou (Deputy Editor-in-Chief of China Daily, Mr Zhou Li), my dear panel members, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am pleased to join you all today at the Greater Bay Area Conference.

  Hong Kong proudly serves as a dynamic bridge linking the Chinese Mainland, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and the global market. I would like to take this opportunity today to highlight three key pillars that underpin Hong Kong's leadership in this new era of collaboration: our robust legal framework, our world-class legal services and our pioneering advances in legal co-operation through the GBA framework.

First pillar

  Hong Kong's legal framework is the bedrock of financial innovation and sustainable economic development. Hong Kong's common law system offers certainty, transparency, and credibility, qualities highly prized by international investors and financial institutions. This robust legal infrastructure protects property rights and effectively enforces contracts, fostering confidence in developing advanced financial products and fintech innovations.

  We are also conscious of the need to be agile and forward-looking, responding to evolving market needs in a timely manner. For instance, recent refinements to the paperless securities markets enhance efficiency on the one hand and provide better investor protection and transparency on the other.

  Additionally, the Stablecoins Ordinance, which took effect in August, establishes a clear licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins. The Ordinance introduces rigorous safeguards against financial stability risks, promotes investor protection while encouraging financial innovation.

  These initiatives demonstrate our proactive approach in adapting our regulatory framework to new financial realities, reinforcing Hong Kong's status as the freest economy in the world and the preferred hub for both traditional and cutting-edge financing.

Second pillar

  Of course, a sophisticated financial system is only as strong as the legal expertise that supports it. This brings me to the second pillar: how Hong Kong's legal services empower Chinese Mainland enterprises to go global confidently.

  Our legal sector is robust and diverse, with about 1 700 barristers and over 11 000 solicitors across more than 900 firms, many having a strong presence on the Chinese Mainland and in other parts of the world. Furthermore, over 1 600 foreign lawyers from about 40 jurisdictions and 80 foreign firms also operate here. This extensive and diverse talent pool is consistently ranked among the world's best in practice areas like capital markets, corporate law and dispute resolution.

  Specifically, as a place of arbitration, Hong Kong is the world's second most preferred seat for arbitration and tops Asia-Pacific in the latest international survey. This is a vivid testament to the international credibility of our arbitration regime.

  Unique legal arrangements with the Chinese Mainland further strengthen our position. Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction where parties can seek interim measures like freezing orders directly from the Chinese Mainland courts and benefit from a comprehensive mechanism for reciprocal enforcement of judgments, including intellectual property cases.

  Meanwhile, Hong Kong-invested companies in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and other Chinese Mainland cities in the GBA enjoy greater flexibility in choosing Hong Kong law or Hong Kong as the place of arbitration regardless of ownership ratios. This offers the credibility and predictability of Hong Kong's common law system when investors leverage the immense opportunities in the GBA - a truly ""best of both worlds"" advantage.

Third pillar

  Building on our foundation of expertise, our third pillar is to facilitate integration and collaboration in the GBA. Taking the area of commercial dispute resolution as an example, we are actively working to set up a platform for GBA commercial mediation and arbitration. This will bring together mediation and arbitration institutions in GBA to adopt the unified GBA Standards. Currently, established GBA Standards cover mediator and arbitrator qualifications, harmonised mediation rules and a panel of mediators. By setting up a clear roster of institutions that implement the GBA standards, we send a strong signal to the market about where to find efficient and trusted dispute resolution services in the GBA.

  In conclusion, Hong Kong's stable and dynamic legal environment is a pillar of its strength as an international financial centre, and a catalyst for deeper collaboration and integration in the GBA. With a world-class financial regulatory environment, unparalleled legal expertise and effective legal co-operation with the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong solidifies our indispensable role as the premier gateway for finance, business and investments in the GBA and beyond.

  On this note, I wish the Conference a great success. Thank you very much."

Customs officers distributed promotional items to residents and introduced to them Customs' enforcement actions against illicit cigarettes and the latest amendments to illicit cigarette-related legislation, including an increase in the maximum penalty for offences related to duty-not-paid cigarettes from a $1 million fine and two-year imprisonment to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment. Customs also explained to estate security personnel how to deal with suspected illicit cigarette activities.

If public rental housing units are found to be involved in illicit cigarette crimes, Customs will notify the HD for follow-up action after the conclusion of court proceedings. Customs reminds members of the public, especially young people, not to buy or sell illicit cigarettes or distribute illicit cigarette leaflets to avoid creating a criminal record that could affect their future.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities. Also, Customs will strengthen publicity and education to remind the public not to take part in unlawful acts related to illicit cigarettes.

Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/).

Singapore ETO and Chocolate Rain bring Hong Kong creativity to Singapore through community arts exhibition (with photos),2025-10-23 15:44,2025-10-23 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300454.htm,"  The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Singapore (Singapore ETO) and the renowned Hong Kong creative brand Chocolate Rain are jointly presenting a community arts exhibition at Enabling Village, Singapore, from today (October 23) to October 26. This vibrant showcase welcomes art lovers from all walks of life and serves as a platform to foster cultural exchange between Hong Kong and Singapore.

  Led by founder Ms Prudence Mak, the Chocolate Rain team has curated a dazzling collection of exhibits that bring together the iconic landmarks and culinary delights of the two places. Visitors can marvel at giant inflatables of Hong Kong's beloved egg tarts, fish balls, and Hong Kong-style French toasts, alongside whimsical 3D figurines of Hong Kong's panda, taxi, and ferry, as well as Singapore's landmarks, the Merlion and Marina Bay Sands.

  At the opening ceremony, the Director of the Singapore ETO, Mr Owin Fung, remarked, ""Hong Kong is a city where creativity flourishes, with our cultural and creative industries gaining recognition both at home and on the international stage. As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Singapore ETO alongside the 10th anniversary of Enabling Village, this milestone provides a meaningful opportunity to share the vibrancy of Hong Kong's creativity and artistry with our friends in Singapore.""

  He added, ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is committed to advancing the city's arts, cultural, and creative industries, with the aim of positioning Hong Kong as an East-meets-West hub for international cultural exchange. By bringing our brands and creative spirit abroad, including Chocolate Rain, the Singapore ETO aspires to build closer connections, enrich cultural exchanges, and deepen mutual understanding between the people of our two communities.""

  Beyond the captivating installations, the exhibition features a series of 12 engaging DIY art and upcycling workshops conducted by Mak and her team. Participants can unleash their creativity and bring home complimentary Hong Kong-and-Singapore-themed souvenirs. Local social service agencies are also specially invited to participate, providing opportunities for persons with disabilities and their caregivers to engage in artistic creation and experience the joy of self-expression. Mr Fung and heads of social service agencies also took part in a workshop, where they experienced first-hand the joy of creating upcycled art alongside participants, and shared in the spirit of inclusiveness and creativity that the exhibition seeks to promote.

  Founded in 2000, Chocolate Rain is a Hong Kong-based creative brand dedicated to crafting unique stories and exhibitions filled with imagination and sincerity. The brand inspires young people to care for the environment, spread positive energy, and embrace their creativity. Over the years, Chocolate Rain has showcased its works across the globe, including on the Chinese Mainland and in the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia.

  The Singapore ETO and Chocolate Rain are delighted to hold the exhibition at Enabling Village with the support of its administrator SG Enable, Singapore's focal agency for disability inclusion, joining hands to foster social inclusion in the community. Enabling Village is an inclusive community space that brings together social businesses, community services, training providers, and lifestyle amenities within a welcoming environment that celebrates the abilities of all."
駐新加坡經貿辦與Chocolate Rain在新加坡舉辦社區藝術展展現香港創意（附圖）,2025-10-23 15:44,2025-10-23 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300444.htm,"香港駐新加坡經濟貿易辦事處（駐新加坡經貿辦）與香港知名創作品牌Chocolate Rain於今日（十月二十三日）至十月二十六日，共同在新加坡新協立綜合設施舉辦社區藝術展。這場繽紛多彩的展覽歡迎不同藝術愛好者參觀，藉此促進香港與新加坡之間的文化交流。

由創辦人麥雅端帶領的Chocolate Rain團隊策劃了一系列別具匠心的展品，設計融入兩地的地標和美食。參觀者可欣賞到香港經典食品如蛋撻、魚蛋、港式西多士的巨型充氣藝術品，以及別出心裁的3D模型，包括香港的大熊貓、的士和天星小輪，以及新加坡的地標魚尾獅與濱海灣金沙酒店。

在開幕禮上，駐新加坡經貿辦處長馮浩然致辭時表示：「香港是一個創意蓬勃的城市，我們的文化及創意產業不僅在本地，亦在國際舞台上獲得肯定。適逢駐新加坡經貿辦成立30周年暨新協立綜合設施成立10周年，這里程碑成就了這個契機，讓我們與新加坡朋友分享香港文化創意的多姿多彩。」

他續指：「香港特別行政區政府致力推動香港的藝術、文化和創意產業，旨在將香港發展為中外文化藝術交流中心。透過把Chocolate Rain等本地品牌與創意精神帶到海外，駐新加坡經貿辦希望藉此推動兩地建立更緊密的聯繫和文化交流，加強相互了解。」

除了引人注目的展品，展覽亦安排了一系列由麥雅端及其團隊主持，共12場的DIY藝術及舊物升級再造工作坊。參加者能盡情發揮創意，並可獲得別具香港與新加坡特色的紀念品。當地社會服務組織特別獲邀參與，為身心障礙人士及其照顧者提供藝術創作體驗和表達自我的機會。馮浩然與多個社會服務組織主管亦親身參與其中一場工作坊，與其他參加者一同體驗升級再造藝術的樂趣，體現展覽所倡導的共融與創意精神。

立法會：環境及生態局副局長就「推動鄉郊旅遊」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-23 15:18,2025-10-23 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300266.htm,"以下是環境及生態局副局長黃淑嫻今日（十月二十三日）在立法會會議就陳學鋒議員動議的「推動鄉郊旅遊」議案的開場發言：

主席：

我感謝陳學鋒議員提出的議案和劉業強議員、陳月明議員、陸頌雄議員及姚柏良議員提出的修正案，讓大家有機會在立法會討論鄉郊旅遊議題。

引言

我們重視國家提出的「綠水青山就是金山銀山」理念。《十四五規劃綱要》將「生態文明建設實現新進步」列為經濟社會發展的主要目標之一，並提出在「推動綠色發展，促進人與自然和諧共生」的目標下，推動經濟社會發展的全面綠色轉型，並建設美麗中國。

環境及生態局一直基於自然保育和環境保護的大前提，配合可持續的生態及鄉郊旅遊發展。香港擁有豐富珍貴的生態資源和濃厚獨特的鄉郊文化，我們致力保育生態，復育鄉村，保存自然及人文資源，提供相關配套，並做好宣傳教育，讓訪客的生態及鄉郊旅遊體驗是可持續的。

生態及鄉郊資源

香港郊野公園每年吸引超過1 200萬人次到訪，壯麗的山海美景享譽全球，具山海都市近在咫尺的特色。我們有香港聯合國教科文組織世界地質公園和位於《拉姆薩爾公約》指定的國際重要濕地旁的香港濕地公園等。

在二○二四年十一月二日開幕的紅花嶺郊野公園，動植物種豐富多樣，不少具保育價值，部分地方亦保存了戰時遺跡。在同年十一月九日開幕的塱原自然生態公園，有大片淡水濕地，是水鳥、兩棲動物及其他濕地物種的重要覓食、棲息和繁殖地，孕育着各類野生動物、也便利生態友善模式耕作。

日後，位處北部都會區的三寶樹濕地保育公園會結合保育、康樂旅遊和漁農業發展，除提升后海灣一帶生境質素和生物多樣性，亦會提供優質的戶外生態教育及康樂體驗，並促進水產養殖業現代化。

推廣城嶺風光

除優化現有行山徑網絡和配套設施，當中亦涉及一些戰地遺跡徑，我們亦正積極落實「四山」旅遊項目，即太平山、鳳凰山、大帽山和西貢海，以「咫尺山海、城嶺風光」為主題，深化綠色旅遊的發展，並做好配套和推廣。

我們選擇「四山」作為推廣項目時，已充分考慮這些旅遊景點的條件，包括已配備基本遊客設施，公共交通相對便利且能承載較多遊人，政府只需進行小型改善工程，對生態環境的影響預計輕微。

我們在「四山」地點改善山徑及休憩設施，增設路標和資訊牌、在山徑沿途種植本地原生賞花植物、串聯旅遊業界和鄰近旅遊點的營辦商進一步規劃當地及鄰近景點的綠色旅遊行程和發展旅遊產品等。各項措施會分階段完成，並由二○二五年下半年至二○二六年年底陸續推出。

鄉郊文化及休閒漁農業

為保育鄉郊自然生態和鄉村傳統文化，鄉郊保育辦公室的鄉郊保育資助計劃自二○一九年起至今資助了56個項目，包括荔枝窩、梅子林和谷埔，共舉辦了超過3 000個多元及創新的活動，向公眾展現偏遠鄉郊的自然美景及人文風貌。今年年初，鄉郊保育辦公室在谷埔舉辦「鄉郊豐年節：谷埔『聲—色—味』之旅」活動，匯合音樂、藝術和傳統美食，吸引公眾體驗鄉郊文化。往後，我們會繼續透過資助計劃，在印洲塘一帶鄉郊推展嶄新深度文化生態遊活動，讓公眾感受鄉郊的自然環境和文化特色，促進鄉郊復育。

另外，因應香港深厚的漁農歷史文化，政府正積極推動業界發展休閒漁農業，包括發掘和善用香港不同水域的休閒漁業元素，以及推動農場為訪客提供多元化的農業參觀體驗，發展具香港特色的活動，例如去年六月推出並持續優化的「農＋樂」農場計劃及今年九月推出的「漁＋樂」魚場計劃，並透過合適途徑作出推廣及宣傳。

相關部門的便利措施

政府亦設立了跨部門「鄉郊地區賓館及食物業牌照工作小組」，為92條偏遠鄉郊村落制訂了一系列優化措施。負責賓館發牌、食肆發牌、城市規劃、土地、樓宇安全、消防安全及環境衞生等範疇的相關決策局及部門亦參與其中。政府的目標是在二○二五年第四季公布申請指引，各部門就其管轄範疇處理相關申請時，會落實該指引內的相關便利措施，而鄉郊保育辦公室會繼續其給予意見的角色。

就修正案提到的鄉郊賓館牌照，民政及青年事務局轄下的民政事務總署會優化其現行的《申請賓館（度假營）牌照指引》，並推出新的《鄉村屋宇申請賓館牌照指引》，更清晰和具體地說明與牌照相關的樓宇和消防安全要求，便利全港鄉郊地區的民宿營運。

就修正案提到的食物業牌照，環境及生態局去年推出《墟市申請資源指南》更新版，讓舉辦墟市的團體或人士掌握相關資訊及申請程序，包括申請臨時食物製造廠牌照，以便在墟市期間在其攤檔烹製及售賣食物及飲品。

結語

基於保育生態的大前提，就熱門地點，漁護署（漁農自然護理署）正持續監察情況，適時檢視其訪客承載量，以及按需要靈活應用管理策略；此外亦正進行研究，以評估有否需要進一步加強未來的跟進工作。

接下來，我們會細心聆聽各位議員提出的觀察和建議，稍後在總結發言階段再作詳細回應。

多謝主席。"
