Good afternoon, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a privilege to address you at the 2025 Hong Kong Green Finance Association Annual Forum, themed ""Navigating Climate Finance and Geopolitics: Strategies for Transition"".

As Asia's premier international financial centre, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to channel global capital toward a sustainable future. Amid geopolitical complexities, trade uncertainties, and the urgent need for climate actions, our city is poised to lead the green transition across Asia and beyond.

Let me reaffirm Hong Kong's role as Asia's leading green finance hub. Last year, our green and sustainable debt market, encompassing bonds and loans, surpassed US$84 billion. Green and sustainable bonds alone reached US$43 billion, capturing 45 per cent of the regional market and securing Hong Kong's position as Asia's top-ranked green bond market for seven consecutive years since 2018.

To sustain this leadership, we have adopted a four-pillar strategy in partnership with financial regulators and industry stakeholders, including (i) promoting market development, (ii) fostering financial innovation, (iii) enhancing sustainability transparency, and (iv) nurturing talent and enhancing data. Allow me to elaborate on each.

First pillar: promoting market development

Our Government Sustainable Bond Programme, expanded in May last year to cover sustainability on top of green projects, drives the development of sustainable initiatives by the Government and our green bond market. As of June this year, we have issued approximately HK$240 billion equivalent in green bonds, denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi, euros, and US dollars, with tenors ranging from one to 30 years. These issuances provide a critical benchmark for other issuers in Hong Kong and the region.

The programme supports projects across nine categories, including, for example, renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation, pollution prevention and control, waste management and resource recovery, and more. To date, it has funded 116 local green projects. Our annual Green Bond Report, with the 2025 edition due this month, details the allocation of proceeds and environmental benefits, reinforcing transparency and credibility.

Bond issuances aside, we have also been developing the carbon market. The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) operates Core Climate, an international carbon marketplace enabling transparent trading of carbon credits to support global net-zero transition. It is the only platform offering settlement in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi for international voluntary carbon credits. By the end of last year, Core Climate has attracted 100 participants. Carbon credits traded on the platform are sourced from certified projects for example in forestry, solar, wind, and biomass across Asia, South America, and Africa, aiding governments and businesses in furthering their efforts for low-carbon transition.

The HKEX has also signed Memoranda of Understanding with Mainland China's carbon markets, including the Beijing and Shenzhen Green Exchanges, to share expertise and foster regional collaboration.

Also, Hong Kong has advanced our green finance ecosystem beyond green bonds and the carbon market through the development of a local green classification framework. The Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, covering 12 key economic activities, was launched last year with a view to standardising green classification, reducing greenwashing risks, and enhancing information for decision making by investors. We are engaging the industry to expand the taxonomy, and will widen the scope of sectors and economic activities to include transition elements and additional sustainable activities, reinforcing our role as a leading sustainable and transition finance hub.

Second pillar: fostering financial innovation

Innovation is central to our green finance development strategy, and will inspire more ways to tackle the global problem of climate change. Hong Kong has pioneered the world's first government-issued tokenised green bond and the first multi-currency digital bond. These initiatives demonstrate our leadership in bond markets, green finance, and fintech. Tokenised bonds enable efficient settlement, broaden investor access, enhance interoperability, and improve transparency and efficiency. Continuing the success of our earlier issuance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is preparing our third tokenised bond issuance, advancing our plans for regularised offerings.

To integrate fintech with green finance, we are expanding our green fintech ecosystem, positioning Hong Kong as a regional green fintech hub. The Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group updated the Hong Kong Green Fintech Map this year, providing a comprehensive overview of green fintech companies and services and facilitating adoption and application.

Also, we launched the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme last year, offering early-stage funding to eligible technology companies and research institutes in Hong Kong. So far 60 projects have been approved, advancing commercialisation and adoption.

As for further innovation in carbon market, the HKMA's Project Ensemble explores tokenised deposits and Central Bank Digital Currency for interbank settlement, as well as tokenisation of real-world assets including carbon credits via blockchain. We are also exploring collaborations with central bank peers on enhancing transparency and efficiency in carbon credit trading through blockchain technology.

Third pillar: enhancing sustainability transparency

As sustainable development gains global prominence, ensuring accurate and consistent sustainability information is critical for investors and market participants. In December last year, we launched the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong, outlining a clear path for large publicly accountable entities to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Sustainability Disclosure Standards by 2028.

In June this year, the IFRS Foundation recognised Hong Kong as one of the first jurisdictions to commit to fully adopting ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) standards, underscoring our dedication to transparency in capital markets. This facilitates informed investment decisions and promotes global capital flows via our trusted market.

Also, our Stock Exchange has introduced enhanced climate-related disclosure requirements, based on the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, phasing in for listed companies from the beginning of this year.

As for the support to SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in sustainability reporting, our Steering Group is enhancing the Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for non-listed companies/SMEs. Launched in 2022, the Questionnaire is intended to provide a free and easy-to-use sustainability reporting template to corporates in need, facilitating their understanding of sustainability performance and raising their sustainability profiles to lenders, investors, and supply chain clients. Taking into account industry feedback and latest market developments, the Steering Group is enhancing the Questionnaire to make it more accessible and inclusive. The 2.0 version of the Questionnaire will soon be rolled out on the website of the Steering Group. Please watch out for that. Going forward, we will collaborate with the industry further to promote the usage of the Questionnaire.

Fourth pillar: nurturing talent and enhancing data

Building a skilled workforce is essential for advancing our green finance development. We launched the Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme for local market practitioners, professionals, students, and graduates. By July this year, the scheme has a coverage of 95 programmes and qualifications, including banking, asset management, insurance, and more, from local and international providers. Over 7,600 applications have been approved, totaling more than HK$42 million in reimbursements. We will extend this scheme to 2028 to sustain our efforts in talent development.

Finally, it is important for us to enhance investor education and understanding on green finance through better data, equipping stakeholders with analytical tools and insights for informed decision-making. The Steering Group has thus launched a data portal, containing Government data sources for assessing physical risks in Hong Kong, such as historical data on catastrophe damages and tropical cyclone impact data. We encourage the use of the tools and technology to enhance data availability and understanding of the impact of climate change in Hong Kong. We also hope it would in turn facilitate development of more targeted sustainable finance and technology solutions enabled by data insights.

Before I conclude, I would like to invite all of you to engage in Hong Kong Green Week, our flagship sustainability event. This platform fosters collaboration among global stakeholders, and your active participation is vital to shaping a sustainable future.

Hong Kong's four-pillar strategy including promoting market development, fostering innovation, enhancing transparency, and nurturing talent and enhancing data, positions us well to navigate the global challenges of climate change. By driving these initiatives, we are not only maintaining our leadership but also forging a collaborative, resilient and sustainable path forward. In this regard, I definitely look forward to continue our collaboration with HKGFA and Dr Ma (Chairman and President of HKGFA, Dr Ma Jun), and I urge you to join us in this global endeavor, turning visions into actions for a greener future. Thank you."

This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

Dr. Ma (Chairman and President of HKGFA, Dr Ma Jun), Professor Li (Professor of Political Science and Founding Director of the Centre on Contemporary China and the World of the University of Hong Kong, Dr Li Cheng), Dr. Berglöf (Chief Economist, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Dr Erik Berglöf), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the eighth edition of the Hong Kong Green Finance Association Annual Forum.

 This year's Forum marks the opening of Hong Kong Green Week. This week, leading voices from global financial institutions, corporations and policy circles will engage in essential discussions on sustainable finance, climate technologies, impact investing and regional green co-operation. They'll share knowledge, experiences and explore how green transformation can create fresh opportunities, particularly in the face of a volatile geopolitical landscape.

A world of contrast

 Let me begin by acknowledging some uncomfortable realities. The urgency of the climate crisis is clearer than ever, and we are all witnessing it and feeling it first-hand, in the unprecedented heatwaves from Europe to Japan and the numerous black rainstorms that have battered our city this summer.

 This devastating reality is compounded by rising unilateralism. The US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and an overt policy shift back to fossil fuels, are disappointing. It weakens the collective commitment to climate action and, no less important, complicates the US$1.3 trillion annual climate-finance target for developing countries, reached at COP 29 (the 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).

 Still, we must not lose hope. Many countries remain firmly committed to net-zero transition, in particular our country, China, which stands by its 3060 goals. According to estimates, our country's CO2 emissions in the first quarter this year fell by 1.6 per cent year on year. This is the first time that clean-energy expansion is leading the fall in CO2 level, and that's despite rapid growth in power demand. China is expected to invest some US$820 billion in energy transition this year, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the global total.

 Moreover, its national emissions trading scheme continues to expand, now covering 70 per cent of the country's emissions, including key polluting sectors such as cement, steel and aluminium.

 Across Asia and the Global South, the progress is also encouraging. In the Asia-Pacific region, investment in energy transition, last year, surpassed US$1 trillion for the first time. That's more than double the amount invested in the Americas. ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states reaffirmed their commitment to climate resilience at their recent summit, underscoring the priority the region has accorded to climate action. For Belt and Road economies as a whole, renewable energy now constitutes 30 per cent of their total energy investments, up from less than 5 per cent just a decade ago.

 Technological advancements are also offering new hope. Beyond solar power and electric vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force.The International Energy Agency predicts that, by 2035, the widespread use of AI could reduce global energy consumption by an amount greater than the total energy usage of Mexico.

How Hong Kong can contribute

 Here in Hong Kong, we remain steadfast in our commitment to climate action. We are on track to cut our carbon emissions in half by 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This goal is anchored in four key strategies: decarbonising power generation, improving energy efficiency in buildings, promoting green transport and reducing waste.

 In power generation, we are making pleasing progress. By 2026, with the completion of enhancements to the cross-boundary Clean Energy Transmission System, the share of zero-carbon electricity in our fuel mix is expected to rise from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. We are also planning for the construction of new facilities in Tseung Kwan O to further expand our capacity to import zero-carbon energy. Upon completion of the project, the share of zero-carbon energy in our fuel mix could increase to about 60 to 70 per cent.

 Beyond fulfilling our domestic commitments, Hong Kong has much more to offer the world. As an international financial centre and an innovation hub, we are well positioned to contribute to global green transition.

On green and sustainable finance

 Hong Kong has long been Asia's frontrunner in green and sustainable finance. In 2024, we issued more than US$80 billion in sustainable debts, with green bonds accounting for around 45 per cent of the regional total. Estimated issuances of sustainable debts in the first half of 2025 reached over US$34billion, an increase of 15 per cent year on year.Over 200 ESG funds have been authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission, with an AUM (assets under management) exceeding US$140 billion, up more than 50 per cent in just three years. These figures speak volumes about our growing role as a green financing and investment hub.

 And we have been doing more than that. For example, in the area of transition finance. While it still represents a small fraction of the sustainable finance markets, it is gaining a traction and offers considerable prospects. For instance, transition bonds account for only around 3 per cent of the sustainable bonds market in the ASEAN+3 Market. Hong Kong obviously has the potential to become a transition finance hub, helping hard-to-abate sectors to decarbonise.

 Separately, last year, we issued the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, which aligns with the frameworks of both the Chinese Mainland and the European Union. Today, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) begins a public consultation to expand this taxonomy to cover transition finance. Other elements include expanding sector coverage and introducing climate change adaptation. These are pivotal to scaling up capital flows to accelerate green transformation.

 Taking a broader perspective, setting and upholding international standards are important if we are to attract and channel more investments to green and transition projects. Hong Kong is proud to contribute to the setting of the ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) reporting standards and the related disclosure framework. As confirmed by the IFRS Foundation (the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) in June this year, Hong Kong is one of the few jurisdictions in Asia with a clear roadmap for full adoption.

 We are also working to mobilise more capital across the public and private sectors. The HKMA has entered into strategic partnerships with multilateral organisations to co-invest in climate and development projects. And our vibrant venture capital and private-equity sector, plus the concentration of wealthy family offices and high-net-worth individuals, are great resources. A study shows that 87 per cent of high-net-worth investors are eager to support climate-focused investments. There is even stronger interest in transition investing than in sustainable investing.

 In this regard, there is great potential in developing innovative, climate-focused financial products that cater to market appetite. 

Expanding Green Innovation

 Beyond finance, technological innovation is the engine that will drive green transformation. On this, Hong Kong is emerging as a green technology hub. Today, more than 250 green tech companies are based in Science Park and Cyberport. These firms are developing globally competitive solutions – from smart grid to carbon capture technologies. They are expanding rapidly into the Mainland and international markets.

 And, through the coordinated efforts of the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, OASES, Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, we are attracting prime green enterprises from around the world. These companies span a wide array of technologies – from AI-driven green solutions to sustainable aviation fuel, electric mobility infrastructure and next-generation power systems.

 We are helping them to connect with Hong Kong universities and supply chains, identify more application scenarios and tap into markets across the Greater Bay Area, Asia and beyond.

 Just as I said earlier, AI can power green transition. It can help traditional industries and sectors optimise production processes and energy consumption, thereby substantially reducing their carbon footprint. Hong Kong has prioritised AI as a core industry. I'm confident that many AI solutions for decarbonisation can scale here and make a lasting impact.

Closing

 Ladies and gentlemen, there is only one earth, one planet that we all share. While the world may be facing substantial geopolitical challenges, Hong Kong is fully committed to becoming a reliable and resourceful partner in the global green transformation.

 Through forums like this, we reaffirm our commitment to collaboration and partnership. In the space of sustainable finance, technology, talent and many other areas, we can work together to turn climate challenges into rewarding opportunities.

 On this note, I wish the Forum and Hong Kong Green Week every success, and all of you the best of health and business.

 Thank you."

 Still, we must not lose hope. Many countries remain firmly committed to net-zero transition, in particular our country, China, which stands by its 3060 goals. According to estimates, our country's CO2 emissions in the first quarter this year fell by 1.6 per cent year on year. This is the first time that clean-energy expansion is leading the fall in CO2 level, and that's despite rapid growth in power demand. China is expected to invest some US$820 billion in energy transition this year, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the global total.

 Moreover, its national emissions trading scheme continues to expand, now covering 70 per cent of the country's emissions, including key polluting sectors such as cement, steel and aluminium.

 Across Asia and the Global South, the progress is also encouraging. In the Asia-Pacific region, investment in energy transition, last year, surpassed US$1 trillion for the first time. That's more than double the amount invested in the Americas. ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states reaffirmed their commitment to climate resilience at their recent summit, underscoring the priority the region has accorded to climate action. For Belt and Road economies as a whole, renewable energy now constitutes 30 per cent of their total energy investments, up from less than 5 per cent just a decade ago.

 Technological advancements are also offering new hope. Beyond solar power and electric vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force.The International Energy Agency predicts that, by 2035, the widespread use of AI could reduce global energy consumption by an amount greater than the total energy usage of Mexico.

How Hong Kong can contribute

 Here in Hong Kong, we remain steadfast in our commitment to climate action. We are on track to cut our carbon emissions in half by 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This goal is anchored in four key strategies: decarbonising power generation, improving energy efficiency in buildings, promoting green transport and reducing waste.

 In power generation, we are making pleasing progress. By 2026, with the completion of enhancements to the cross-boundary Clean Energy Transmission System, the share of zero-carbon electricity in our fuel mix is expected to rise from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. We are also planning for the construction of new facilities in Tseung Kwan O to further expand our capacity to import zero-carbon energy. Upon completion of the project, the share of zero-carbon energy in our fuel mix could increase to about 60 to 70 per cent.

 Beyond fulfilling our domestic commitments, Hong Kong has much more to offer the world. As an international financial centre and an innovation hub, we are well positioned to contribute to global green transition.

On green and sustainable finance

 Hong Kong has long been Asia's frontrunner in green and sustainable finance. In 2024, we issued more than US$80 billion in sustainable debts, with green bonds accounting for around 45 per cent of the regional total. Estimated issuances of sustainable debts in the first half of 2025 reached over US$34billion, an increase of 15 per cent year on year.Over 200 ESG(environmental, social and governance)funds have been authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission, with an AUM (assets under management) exceeding US$140 billion, up more than 50 per cent in just three years. These figures speak volumes about our growing role as a green financing and investment hub.

 And we have been doing more than that. For example, in the area of transition finance. While it still represents a small fraction of the sustainable finance markets, it is gaining a traction and offers considerable prospects. For instance, transition bonds account for only around 3 per cent of the sustainable bonds market in the ASEAN+3 Market. Hong Kong obviously has the potential to become a transition finance hub, helping hard-to-abate sectors to decarbonise.

 Separately, last year, we issued the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, which aligns with the frameworks of both the Chinese Mainland and the European Union. Today, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) begins a public consultation to expand this taxonomy to cover transition finance. Other elements include expanding sector coverage and introducing climate change adaptation. These are pivotal to scaling up capital flows to accelerate green transformation.

 Taking a broader perspective, setting and upholding international standards are important if we are to attract and channel more investments to green and transition projects. Hong Kong is proud to contribute to the setting of the ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) reporting standards and the related disclosure framework. As confirmed by the IFRS Foundation (the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) in June this year, Hong Kong is one of the few jurisdictions in Asia with a clear roadmap for full adoption.

 We are also working to mobilise more capital across the public and private sectors. The HKMA has entered into strategic partnerships with multilateral organisations to co-invest in climate and development projects. And our vibrant venture capital and private-equity sector, plus the concentration of wealthy family offices and high-net-worth individuals, are great resources. A study shows that 87 per cent of high-net-worth investors are eager to support climate-focused investments. There is even stronger interest in transition investing than in sustainable investing.

 In this regard, there is great potential in developing innovative, climate-focused financial products that cater to market appetite. 

Expanding green innovation

 Beyond finance, technological innovation is the engine that will drive green transformation. On this, Hong Kong is emerging as a green technology hub. Today, more than 250 green tech companies are based in Science Park and Cyberport. These firms are developing globally competitive solutions – from smart grid to carbon capture technologies. They are expanding rapidly into the Mainland and international markets.

 And, through the coordinated efforts of the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, OASES (Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises), Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, we are attracting prime green enterprises from around the world. These companies span a wide array of technologies – from AI-driven green solutions to sustainable aviation fuel, electric mobility infrastructure and next-generation power systems.

 We are helping them to connect with Hong Kong universities and supply chains, identify more application scenarios and tap into markets across the Greater Bay Area, Asia and beyond.

 Just as I said earlier, AI can power green transition. It can help traditional industries and sectors optimise production processes and energy consumption, thereby substantially reducing their carbon footprint. Hong Kong has prioritised AI as a core industry. I'm confident that many AI solutions for decarbonisation can scale here and make a lasting impact.

Closing

 Ladies and gentlemen, there is only one earth, one planet that we all share. While the world may be facing substantial geopolitical challenges, Hong Kong is fully committed to becoming a reliable and resourceful partner in the global green transformation.

 Through forums like this, we reaffirm our commitment to collaboration and partnership. In the space of sustainable finance, technology, talent and many other areas, we can work together to turn climate challenges into rewarding opportunities.

 On this note, I wish the Forum and Hong Kong Green Week every success, and all of you the best of health and business.

 Thank you."
CHP appeals for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions,2025-09-08 10:07,2025-09-08 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800338.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 8) appealed to members of the public for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions and urged them to maintain personal and environmental hygiene. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

  Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Burkholderia pseudomallei is widespread in soil and muddy water, particularly common in moist clay soil. Humans can become infected through contact with contaminated soil and surface water (especially through skin abrasions/wounds); inhalation of contaminated dust/water droplets; and ingestion of contaminated water. Those with underlying diseases or immunosuppression have higher risks of contracting the disease.

According to overseas literature and local data, Burkholderia pseudomallei in the soil and muddy water may be exposed to the ground after typhoons or storms, and the bacteria would spread more easily with strong wind and storms. As such, infection cases are more common after typhoons or storms.

In view of the recent disturbance caused by typhoon andconsecutive days of torrential rain, the CHP again reminded members of the public, in particular high-risk groups such as those with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water as far as practicable, to prevent melioidosis infection.

Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong and human infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year. As of yesterday (September 7), eight melioidosis infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded. In light of the cluster of melioidosis cases recorded in Sham Shui Po in 2022, the CHP and the Water Supplies Department have implemented a series of precautionary and monitoring measures, including the installation of high efficiency particulate air filters at the ventilators of all fresh water service reservoirs in Hong Kong, enhancing residual chlorine levels in drinking water, continual monitoring of residual chlorine level of fresh water in service reservoirs and consumers' taps, as well as health education and surveillance of infection cases. No abnormalities were detected from all surveillance results so far, including those conducted after typhoons and heavy rain, while the drinking water quality monitoring results have consistently been in compliance with the Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards.

Person-to-person transmission andanimal-to-human transmission are rare but may occur through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Melioidosis may present with localised infection (such as cutaneous abscess), pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, sepsis, or chronic suppurative infection. Depending on the site of infection, common symptoms of melioidosis include fever, headache, localised pain or swelling, ulceration, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, and swelling of regional lymph nodes. The CHP appealed again to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromised conditions, in order to receive appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

The CHP reminded members of the public to take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. usinggloves and wearing boots;
If exposure to contaminated water or soil is inevitable, high-risk individuals should wear a mask, gloves and boots;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover any cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soilor gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

衞生防護中心呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺預防類鼻疽感染,2025-09-08 10:06,2025-09-08 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800337.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（九月八日）呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺，保持個人及環境衞生，預防感染類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

類鼻疽是一種由類鼻疽伯克氏菌引致的疾病。類鼻疽伯克氏菌廣泛存在於土壤和泥水中，特別是濕潤的黏土。人類可能通過接觸受污染的土壤和水源（尤其是經皮膚損傷／傷口）、吸入受污染的微塵／水滴和飲用受污染的水而受到感染。長期病患者及免疫力弱人士有較大機會受感染。

根據海外文獻和本地數據，在颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令類鼻疽病菌更容易散播，令感染個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。

因應近期本港受颱風以及連日暴雨影響，中心再次提醒市民，特別是高風險群組例如長期病患者，盡量避免接觸土壤或泥水，以免受類鼻疽病菌感染。

類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得人類感染類鼻疽個案。截至昨日（九月七日），本港今年錄得八宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。因應二○二二年深水埗出現的類鼻疽群組個案，中心及水務署已採取一系列的預防及監察措施，包括在全港所有配水庫的通風口加裝高效能空氣過濾網、加強食水的餘氯含量、持續監測配水庫及用戶水龍頭食水的餘氯含量，並加強健康教育和監測感染個案。至今包括於颱風及暴雨後所進行的監測結果未有出現異常情況，而食水水質監測的結果亦一直符合香港食水標準。

類鼻疽病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可以透過接觸患者的血液或體液而傳播。類鼻疽的病人可出現局部感染（例如皮膚膿腫）、肺炎、腦膜腦炎、敗血症或長期化膿性感染。視乎感染的部位，類鼻疽常見的病徵包括發燒、頭痛、局部痛楚或腫脹、潰瘍、胸痛、咳嗽、咳血及局部淋巴結腫大。中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。

中心再次提醒市民應採取以下措施預防感染：


避免接觸受污染的土壤；
進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿著適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴；
高風險人士如不能避免接觸受污染的水或土壤，應佩戴口罩和手套，並穿上水靴
接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

HKMA launches public consultation on Phase 2A prototype of Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance,2025-09-08 09:41,2025-09-08 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090500617.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a public consultation today (September 8) on Phase 2A prototype of the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (Hong Kong Taxonomy).

The Hong Kong Taxonomy is an important market enabling tool for promoting informed decision-making in green and sustainable finance. By providing clear, transparent, and robust definitions of what constitutes green and sustainable activities, the taxonomy aims to scale up relevant capital flows while addressing greenwashing concerns.

Building on the publication of Phase 1 of the Hong Kong Taxonomy in May 2024, the HKMA has adopted a phased approach to further enhance the taxonomy, starting with Phase 2A, and progressing through subsequent phases.

The Phase 2A prototype introduces several enhancements aimed at supporting Hong Kong's decarbonisation efforts, facilitating the region's transition to a low-carbon economy, and reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre and a leading green finance hub. The prototype development has been guided by market feedback, government policies, industry needs, and the latest technological advancements.

The key enhancements made in the Phase 2A prototype include:


Expanded sector coverage: Two new sectors critical to the decarbonisation of the region and beyond, namely manufacturing and information and communications technology, have been added to the four sectors under Phase 1, increasing the total number of sectors from four to six;
Increase in economic activities: 13 new economic activities have been added, bringing the total number of economic activities from 12 to 25. Updates have also been made to the technical screening criteria of a number of activities introduced under Phase 1;
Transition elements: Transition elements, including interim decarbonisation targets, measures to support transition and sunset dates (which specify the time by which transition elements will conclude), have been added; and
New environmental objective: A new environmental objective, namely climate change adaptation, have been introduced to address the growing funding needs for managing physical risks and responding to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.


The public consultation commences today and will last until October 8, 2025. The consultation paper is available on the HKMA website. Interested parties are invited to submit their comments on or before the deadline."

勞工處發言人今日（九月八日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

  A spokesman for the LD said today (September 8) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

A key focus was the successful Top Talent Pass Scheme, which has garnered around 135 000 applications and approved nearly 109 000 since its launch in late 2022. Both Emory University and Georgia Tech are among the top eligible universities under the scheme.

On September 5, Ms Ho, accompanied by Senior Vice President of Digital Technologies and Data Infrastructure at Invest Hong Kong, Mr Marcus Woo, engaged with Atlanta-based business leaders from the innovation and technology sector at a high-level breakfast roundtable. They discussed recent developments in innovation and technology sector in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, emphasising the city's thriving startup ecosystem and strong governmental support for tech-led growth and entrepreneurship.

The visit culminated on September 6 with Ms Ho officiating at the opening ceremony of the 2025 Atlanta Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival at Lake Lanier Olympic Park.

She also met with the Mayor of Gainesville, Mr Sam Couvillon, to express her appreciation for the city's ongoing partnership.

I expect every member of the Election Committee to fulfil their responsibilities dutifully and contribute to the steadfast and successful implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

CHP urges students to receive seasonal influenza vaccination early in new school year as one case of severe paediatric influenza A infection reported,2025-09-07 20:14,2025-09-07 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700810.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 7) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection. The CHP urged the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times. Schools and parents should arrange their students and children to participate in the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) programme and receive free SIV to prevent contracting respiratory illnesses.

""Vaccination is the first line of defence against seasonal influenza, reducing the chance of serious complications or death after infection. Including the abovementioned case, there had been four severe paediatric influenza cases since the school resumed. Since January this year, the CHP has recorded 15 cases of severe influenza virus infection in children, 10 of them were unvaccinated in the 2024/25 season. Therefore, we hope that schools and parents could make concerted efforts with us and participate in the SIV outreach activities at school, or arrange for their children to visit their family doctor for the SIV at the start of the new school year to enhance their protection,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The case involved a 11-year-old boy with good past health. He developed a fever, a cough and running nose on September 5. He sought medical attention from a private doctor on September 6. He was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of Ruttonjee Hospital and subsequently transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital the same day. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A complicated with encephalopathy. He is still hospitalised and is in stable condition.
  
The boy’s household contacts, so far, are asymptomatic. He received the SIV last October. There has been no recent influenza outbreak at the school he studied.

Besides, since the start of the new school year, there has been a significant increase in the number of outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI). The CHP recorded four ILI outbreaks in schools in the last week of August (August 24 to August 30), increased to 15 outbreaks this week (August 31 to September 6). The 19 outbreaks recorded in the two weeks include kindergartens/child care centres (five cases), primary schools (nine cases) and secondary schools (five cases).

Although Hong Kong has not entered the summer influenza season so far this year, the CHP's latest surveillance data showed that local influenza activity recently indicated an upward fluctuation and slightly exceeded the baseline threshold. The CHP will cautiously monitor the trend of influenza activity in the next few weeks.

To protect their health and that of their family members, the public should continue to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene and take the following measures to prevent contracting seasonal influenza and other respiratory illnesses:


Persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) should wear surgical masks to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses; high-risk persons (e.g. persons with underlying medical conditions or persons who are immunocompromised) should also wear surgical masks when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Practise hand hygiene frequently, wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
Avoid sharing personal items;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, consider refraining from going to work or school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, perform physical activity regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

再錄得一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童新學年盡快接種流感疫苗,2025-09-07 19:38,2025-09-07 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700760.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月七日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案。中心呼籲市民時刻保持良好個人和環境衞生。學校和家長亦應盡快安排學童和子女在新學年參與季節性流感疫苗接種計劃，免費接種流感疫苗，以預防感染呼吸道疾病。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「接種流感疫苗是預防流感的第一道防線，可降低感染後出現嚴重併發症和死亡的機會。計及上述一宗個案，開學後已錄得四宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案。自今年一月起，中心累計已接獲15宗兒童感染流感病毒的嚴重個案，當中10宗未有接種二○二四／二五季度的疫苗。因此，我們希望學校和家長和我們通力合作，在新學年參與季節性流感疫苗學校外展活動或自行安排子女到家庭醫生接種流感疫苗，加強保障學童健康。」

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的十一歲男童，他自九月五日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和流鼻水，九月六日向私家醫生求醫。同日被送往律敦治醫院急症室，再被轉送到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院兒童深切治療部留醫。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發腦病變。他目前仍然留醫，情況穩定。

男童的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。他曾於去年十月接種流感疫苗。他就讀的學校近日沒有出現流感爆發的情況。

另外，新學期開始後，學校出現的流感樣疾病爆發個案顯著增加。中心錄得在學校發生的流感樣疾病爆發個案由八月最後一周（八月二十四日至三十日）的四宗爆發個案，上升至本周（八月三十一日至九月六日）的15宗爆發個案，兩周錄得的共19宗爆發個案涉及幼稚園／幼兒中心（五宗）、小學（九宗）及中學（五宗）。

雖然本港今年暫未出現夏季流感季節，但中心最新監測數據顯示，本地流感活躍程度近期呈現上升波幅，並輕微超越基線水平。中心需要留意未來數周的流感趨勢。

為保障自己和家人健康，市民應繼續保持良好個人和環境衞生，並應採取以下措施，以預防感染季節性流感或其他呼吸道疾病：


出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士應佩戴外科口罩，以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，而高危人士（如本身有健康問題或免疫力低的人士）在乘搭公共交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時亦應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
常保持雙手清潔，雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
避免與他人共用個人物品；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，考慮避免上班或上學，避免前往人多擠迫的地方，並盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常做體能活動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。

勞工處提醒僱主僱員應訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-09-07 19:20,2025-09-07 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700742.htm,"由於八號熱帶氣旋警告信號即將生效，勞工處今日（九月七日）提醒僱主應與員工訂好在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。

勞工處發言人表示：「在擬訂及執行有關安排時，除考慮機構運作需要等因素，僱主應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法，例如容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應就他們的交通、安全、膳食、休息地點等作好安排。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主應遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
LD urges employers and employees to make work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-09-07 19:20,2025-09-07 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700743.htm,"  As Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) will soon be in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (September 7) reminded employers to make work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable).
  
  An LD spokesman said, ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, apart from factors such as operational needs of establishments, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs. For example, employers may permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work.""
  
  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner, or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.
  
  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should work out arrangements for their transportation, safety, meals, rest places and more. If public transport services are suspended or limited when there is a T8 signal or higher, or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

The abilities he acquired while he was in the CAS Cadet Corps had a profound and positive impact on him, and have served him well throughout his life.

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has always put great emphasis on youth development and has launched a series of youth development programmes to help young people unleash their potential and realise their dreams. Among them, the CAS's Youth Potential Development Scheme provides young people with training and personal growth, nurturing them to become confident, self-disciplined, and effective communicators in society.

  This year's Cadet Corps Foot Drill Competition was conducted in the form of Chinese-style foot drills, aiming to strengthen their sense of belonging to the country and national identity. About 300 cadets formed into 16 teams participated in the competition. In addition, this year marks the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. The CAS also held a slogan design competition today to commemorate this anniversary, encouraging participants to showcase their creativity and express their patriotism.

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至今年七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗個案，當中約90宗為死亡個案。夏季溫度及雨量處於高水平，令多種蚊傳疾病在香港，以至全球爆發的風險持續，市民不能掉以輕心，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。」

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-07 17:30,2025-09-07 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700509.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 7), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  ""According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal. High temperatures and rainfall levels in summer continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world, and members of the public must remain vigilant. They must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

在首宗案件中，一名四十七歲男旅客於九月五日從尼日利亞拉各斯經埃塞俄比亞阿迪斯阿貝巴飛抵本港。海關人員替他清關期間發現有可疑，懷疑他體內藏有毒品，遂把他帶到醫院檢查。

經檢查後，醫生確認該名人士體內藏有異物，海關人員隨即把他拘捕。截至今日（九月七日）下午三時，被捕人士已從體內排出六十粒共重約一點三公斤的懷疑可卡因。

在第二宗案件中，兩名分別為四十一歲的女旅客及四十歲的男旅客昨日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在二人的手提行李內發現批懷疑大麻花收藏於零食包裝袋內，共重約十二公斤，兩人隨即被捕。

首宗案件仍在調查中。經調查後，第二宗案件兩名被捕人士已共同被控以一項販運危險藥物罪，案件將於明日（九月八日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。
