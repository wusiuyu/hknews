政府靈活動員確保投票日市面運作順暢及便利公務員投票,2025-11-14 13:06,2025-11-14 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400390.htm,"為確保立法會換屆選舉投票日的市面整體運作暢順，公務員事務局今日（十一月十四日）向常任秘書長及部門首長發出指示，於十二月七日在轄下部門特別設立「投票日統籌及支援中心」，並靈活調配額外人手在投票日上班，包括按部門運作需要，安排一般星期日休息的公務員於投票日當值，全力支援立法會選舉工作，同時必須採取一切可行措施，便利值班公務員投票。

公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵表示：「立法會是特區政治體制的重要組成部分，辦好第八屆立法會選舉是特區政府的重要工作，所有政府部門均有責任全力支持和配合。靈活調配額外人手在投票日上班，並為值班公務員提供一切可行措施，可確保市面有序暢順運作，市民順利投票，同時便利公務員行使他們的投票權。」

公務員事務局發言人表示，各部門會按局方發出的指示，靈活調配額外人手，動員公務員全力支援投票日的工作，達致以下目的：

（一）確保市面正常有序，防範可能出現的風險或事故，保障全港各區投票過程暢順；
（二）確保妥善監察所有公共服務、設施及重要基建暢順運作；
（三）確保部門各級聯絡及協調渠道暢通，做到「早部署、早介入」，務求盡快並有效應對任何突發問題；
（四）確保有充足人手，必要時迅速支援有需要的部門應付緊急情況；及
（五）確保有充足人手，宣傳呼籲和鼓勵社會各界及早投票。

發言人指出，投票日當日在投票站和點票中心負責選舉工作的公務員有三萬多人。此外，不同部門一向有人手在星期日值勤，包括負責維持社會秩序和治安的紀律部隊和負責在星期日向市民提供民生服務的單位，例如公眾街市、體育館和圖書館等。這些部門會按需要增加值勤人數，亦可在公眾設施設立支援協調服務點，為有需要的市民提供資訊和呼籲市民投票，而其他部門亦會靈活調配額外人手上班。

雖然投票日要上班的公務員人數較以往多，公務員事務局要求各部門必須為值班的公務員提供一切可行措施，便利公務員順利完成投票。這些措施包括：

（一）安排投票日要上班的公務員在值班期間輪流有序短暫離開工作崗位前往票站投票，包括允許值班公務員在當值時間內「先投票，後上班」，或提早下班前往投票，以節省往來的交通時間。值班公務員可按現行規定獲發補假或超時工作津貼；
（二）安排充足的替補人手，確保公共服務不受影響；
（三）安排發還往返辦公室和其所屬票站的交通費予值班期間前往投票的公務員；及
（四）安排部門的工會及義工隊在投票日鼓勵及支援有需要的同事前往所屬票站投票。

公務員事務局較早前已成立專班，督導和籌劃公務員團隊的選舉宣傳與動員工作，並要求公務員首長及其轄下政策局和部門亦成立領導專班，各自落實好宣傳與動員工作，包括接觸市民、業界和前線同事等，及推出宣傳片等。

此外，局方已向政策局和部門發出指引，述明若公務員包括工會代表在工作時間出席官方舉辦的活動（例如2025立法會「愛國者同心治港」選舉論壇）而需暫時離開工作崗位，可向其所屬部門申請，部門管方在考慮運作需要後，認為情況許可會予以批准。"

"Local premieres of films ""Golden Boy"" and ""Someone Like Me"" financed by Film Development Fund",2025-11-14 11:33,2025-11-14 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400270.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Film Development Council (HKFDC):

The local premieres of two films which have funding support from the Film Production Financing Scheme (FPFS) under the Film Development Fund (FDF), namely ""Golden Boy"" and ""Someone Like Me"", will be held tomorrow evening (November 15) and on the evening of November 17 respectively.

   ""Golden Boy"" is directed by Joe Chan, produced by Allen Chan, written by Cheng Sing-mo and Shum Shek-yin, and stars Louis Cheung. The story is about an ex-convict, Cheung Lek, who once earned the moniker ""Golden Boy"" in the boxing ring. Cheung finds himself drifting through a listless middle age until he crosses paths with a gifted child named Fong Yuen and a washed-up coach, Chow Yiu-shan. He then goes back into the ring, embarking on a journey of redemption. The film will be theatrically released in Hong Kong on November 21.

""Someone Like Me"" is directed and written by Tam Wai-ching, produced by Stanley Kwan and Catherine Kwan, and stars Fish Liew and Carlos Chan. The film is about a woman born with cerebral palsy who meets a volunteer providing sexual services for people with disabilities, creating a story that explores the morality and courage to claim one's own narrative.

Last month, the main cast and crew of ""Someone Like Me"" participated in the 38th Tokyo International Film Festival (TIFF) as part of the delegation led by the HKFDC. The film was selected for the TIFF's ""Women's Empowerment"" section and held its world premiere during the festival. It was also selected in the ""Gala Presentation"" section of the 22nd Hong Kong Asian Film Festival. The film will be theatrically released in Hong Kong on November27.

He also said he hopes that more new-generation directors will keep creating films that will gain wide recognition and commercial success."

響應「世界糖尿病日」　衞生署呼籲市民透過健康生活模式預防糖尿病,2025-11-14 11:15,2025-11-14 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400250.htm,"為響應「世界糖尿病日」，衞生署今日（十一月十四日）呼籲市民實踐健康生活模式，同時通過「早預防、早發現、早治療」，以有效減低患上糖尿病及相關併發症。透過全生命周期方式，政府推廣包括健康飲食及限制攝取油、鹽和糖，多做體能活動、避免吸煙和飲酒的健康生活模式。在慢性疾病管理方面，政府積極推廣「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」），提供便捷的糖尿病及高血壓篩查服務，以及提供血脂檢查，實現「三高全覆蓋」。

衞生署衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「糖尿病是一種常見慢性疾病，特徵為血液中葡萄糖含量過高。若控制不當可引發嚴重併發症，包括心臟病、中風、腎衰竭和失明。全球每九名成年人中就有一名糖尿病患者。衞生署的二○二○至二○二二年度人口健康調查（調查）顯示，15至84歲非住院的人口中，8.5%患有糖尿病或血糖升高，和二○一四至二○一五年度的8.4%相若；調查報告顯示每三名患者中就約有一位未意識到自身患病。在二○二四年，有442宗（臨時數字）登記死亡個案與糖尿病有關，粗死亡率為按每十萬名人口計算5.9人（臨時數字）。」

為提升市民的疾病預防意識和自我健康管理能力，基層醫療署透過各地區康健中心／地區康健站（統稱為康健中心）和家庭醫生積極推廣「健康人生計劃」。政府在二○二三年推出為期三年的「慢病共治計劃」，資助45歲或以上未曾確診患有高血壓或糖尿病的香港居民，配對家庭醫生並於私營醫療市場接受糖尿病及高血壓篩查，並於今年三月擴展至提供血脂檢查。經篩查後被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的參加者可進入治療階段，在政府資助下由自行選擇的家庭醫生繼續診治，以及按健康狀況獲處方藥物，接受專屬護士診所和專職醫療服務。今年十月十五日，已有超過16萬名市民參加了「慢病共治計劃」，約100 400人（即約六成）已完成篩查。其中約40 500人（約四成）已進入治療階段，當中包括被診斷為血糖偏高（即指糖化血紅素6.0-6.4%或空腹血糖6.1-6.9 mmol/L水平），或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的參加者。在發展以家庭醫學服務模式聚焦照顧弱勢社群的策略下，基層醫療署已由今年三月底起分階段擴展「慢病共治計劃」至醫院管理局轄下指定家庭醫學診所及家庭醫學綜合中心，為弱勢社群提供高血壓、高血糖和高血脂篩查，以及慢性疾病管理的服務。有關「慢病共治計劃」詳情，可瀏覽專題網站。

糖尿病主要分為一型、二型和妊娠期糖尿病，其中以二型糖尿病最為常見，約佔所有糖尿病個案的95%，而超重及肥胖、缺乏體能活動和遺傳為患上二型糖尿病的關鍵因素。

徐樂堅醫生說：「無論遺傳風險因素如何，改變生活模式是預防二型糖尿病或延後發病的最佳方法。市民應保持健康體重、均衡飲食並限制糖份和飽和脂肪的攝取、避免飲酒或吸煙。此外，每星期應進行最少150至300分鐘中等強度的帶氧體能活動或同等時間和強度的體能活動；步行亦是其中一項體能活動，可預防多種慢性病和減低患上二型糖尿病的風險。」

為提升市民預防糖尿病和其他非傳染病的意識，政府會繼續透過舉辦健康推廣活動，以提升市民的健康素養，加強公眾了解健康生活的重要性，協助高風險人士定期測量血糖，以及與各政府部門及社區夥伴合作，建設健康的生活環境。

DH appeals to public to adopt healthy lifestyles to prevent diabetes in support of World Diabetes Day,2025-11-14 11:15,2025-11-14 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400252.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (November 14) urged members of the public to adopt healthy lifestyles in support ofWorld Diabetes Day. The risk of developing diabetes mellitus(diabetes) and related complications can be effectively reduced through ""early prevention, early detection and early treatment"". The Government promotes a healthy lifestyle encompassing healthy eating, reducing fat, salt and sugar intake, being physically active, and refraining from smoking and alcohol consumption through a life-course approach. The Government is actively promoting the Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme to manage chronic diseases. The CDCC Pilot Scheme offers convenient screening services for diabetes and hypertension, as well as blood lipid testing, to achieve full coverage of the ""three highs"".

  ""Diabetes is a common chronic condition marked by high levels of glucose in the blood, and improper diabetic control may result in serious complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure and blindness. Globally, one in nine adults has diabetes. In Hong Kong, the Population Health Survey 2020-22 conducted by the DH observed that 8.5 per cent of non-institutionalised persons aged 15 to 84 had diabetes or raised blood glucose, which is at a level similar to the 8.4 per cent recorded in 2014-15. The Survey also showed that approximately one in every three persons with diabetes is not aware that he/she is living with the condition. In 2024, there were 442 (provisional figure) registered deaths attributed to diabetes with a crude death rate of 5.9 per 100 000 population (provisional figure),"" said the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Edwin Tsui.

The Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) promotes the Life Course Preventive Care Plan through District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) and family doctors, in order to enhance public awareness of self-health management and disease prevention. The Government launched the three-year CDCC Pilot Scheme in 2023, subsidising Hong Kong residents aged 45 and above with no known medical history of diabetes or hypertension to be paired with family doctors for diabetes and hypertension screening services in the private healthcare market. In March this year, the CDCC Pilot Scheme was expanded to cover blood lipid testing. Participants diagnosed with prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidaemia after screening can proceed to the treatment phase and will be subsidised by the Government to continue their treatment with a family doctor of their choice and, subject to their health conditions, will be provided with prescribed medication, a dedicated nurse clinic and allied health services. As of October 15 this year, over 160 000 members of the public have enrolled in the Scheme. Approximately 100 400 participants (i.e. about 60 per cent) have completed the screenings, and around 40 500 participants (i.e. about 40 per cent) have proceeded to the treatment phase, including participants who have been diagnosed with prediabetes (i.e. blood glucose level ranging from 6.0 to 6.4 per cent for glycated haemoglobin or a fasting plasma glucose level of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L.), diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidaemia. In developing the strategy to focus on caring for the underprivileged group through a Family Medicine service model, the PHC Commission has been expanding the CDCC Pilot Scheme to designated Hospital Authority Family Medicine Clinics and Family Medicine Integrated Centres in phases since end-March this year, providing underprivileged groups with hypertension, high blood glucose and hyperlipidaemia screenings, as well as chronic disease management services. More details of the CDCC Pilot Scheme can be found on the dedicated website.

Among the main types of diabetes (type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes), type 2 diabetes is the most common form, which makes up more than 95 per cent of all diabetes cases. Key factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight or obese, not getting enough exercise and genetics.

  ""Regardless of genetic risk, lifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Members of the public are urged to reach and keep a healthy body weight, eat a healthy diet and limit sugar and saturated fat intake, refrain from alcohol drinking, and avoid smoking. Moreover, the public should stay physically active with at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent amount and intensity of physical activity throughout the week. Walking as a way of conducting physical activity can also guard against various chronic diseases and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes,"" said Dr Tsui.

To raise public awareness of the prevention of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases, the Government will continue organising health promotional campaigns to enhance people's health literacy about the importance of healthy living, enabling persons at risk to have regular measurements of blood glucose. The Government will also work in close partnership with community partners to foster a health-enhancing environment.

新增一間指定駕駛學校暨駕駛考試中心,2025-11-14 10:00,2025-11-14 11:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111300613.htm,"運輸署今日（十一月十四日）公布，已根據《道路交通條例》（第374章）第88K（1）條指定元朗山下路69號作為指定駕駛學校。

該指定駕駛學校今日正式投入營運，運輸署亦會於該校設置駕駛考試中心進行駕駛考試。連同該校，本港現時共有五間政府指定的駕駛學校暨駕駛考試中心，分別位於沙田、鴨脷洲、元朗及觀塘。

運輸署發言人說，政府非常重視駕駛學校的管理及提供駕駛考試服務，以維持有效的駕駛訓練及考試系統，促進道路安全。署方已發出實務守則監管駕駛學校的運作，包括訓練路線、路面訓練時段及訓練車輛數目等。署方會密切留意駕駛學校的運作及附近路段的交通情況，並適時檢視其運作安排，以道路安全為首要目標，確保駕駛學校遵守實務守則。

政府一向採用「雙軌制」駕駛訓練政策，一方面設立駕駛學校，鼓勵在公用道路以外場地提供駕駛訓練；另一方面，維持足夠的私人駕駛教師，在公用道路上提供駕駛訓練。上述駕駛學校營辦者在得到城市規劃委員會許可後向運輸署申請營運指定駕駛學校，提供私家車、輕型貨車及電單車的駕駛訓練服務。運輸署經仔細審視各項條件，包括上址可提供駕駛訓練及考試所需的設施後，批准相關申請。任何營運者若能自行提供符合條件的用地，包括符合規劃核准用途及可容納駕駛學校基本駕駛訓練和考試設施的土地，政府會按個別申請作考慮及批核。

Additional designated driving school and driving test centre opens,2025-11-14 10:00,2025-11-14 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111300618.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (November 14) that 69 Shan Ha Road, Yuen Long, has been designated as a driving school in accordance with section 88K(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374).

  The designated driving school officially commenced operation today. The TD will also set up a driving test centre in the school for conducting driving tests. Including this school, there are now five government-designated driving schools and driving test centres in Hong Kong, located in Sha Tin, Ap Lei Chau, Yuen Long and Kwun Tong.

  A spokesman for the TD said that the Government attaches great importance to the management of driving schools and the provision of driving test services, striving to maintain an effective driver training and testing system for the promotion of road safety. The TD has issued a Code of Practice for regulating the operation of the driving schools, including training routes, on-street training hours and the number of training vehicles. With road safety being the primary objective, the TD will closely monitor the operation of driving schools and traffic conditions in their vicinities and review their operational arrangements when necessary to ensure compliance with the Code of Practice.

  The Government has long adopted a two-pronged approach in respect of driver training. On one hand, off-street driver training is promoted through the establishment of driving schools. On the other hand, the Government maintains a sufficient supply of private driving instructors for on-street driver training. The driving school's operator, after receiving approval from the Town Planning Board, applied to the TD for the operation of a designated driving school, providing driver training services for private cars, light goods vehicles and motorcycles. After a careful review of all conditions, including the availability of necessary facilities for driver training and testing, the TD approved the application. The Government will consider and approve applications from operators on a case-by-case basis, provided that they can offer sites that meet the requirements, including the permitted land use and space for accommodating basic driver training and testing facilities for a driving school.

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's website for details of designated driving schools."

文化體育及旅遊局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-13 21:55,2025-11-13 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300852.htm,"​以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（十一月十三日）晚上在深圳大運中心游泳館觀賞第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）賽事後會見傳媒的談話內容：

文化體育及旅遊局局長：非常開心，今晚詩蓓是由頭帶到尾，有餘未盡，所以她拿這面金牌，我們所有人都很開心。這是香港游泳隊在全運會歷來第一面金牌，連同早前貝俊龍在帆船的金牌，也是帆船隊第一面全運會金牌，加上（李）思穎（在公路自行車）的衞冕，港隊今屆直至現在已經有三金了。加上網球青年組我們有一面銅牌，現在有三金一銅，在金牌方面已經打破了歷屆紀錄，很值得為我們的運動員喝采和繼續支持他們。

大家也看到我們所有隊伍都出盡全力，今日我也觀看了男子22歲以下籃球比賽，雖然輸了，但打得非常好。

另外，男子（七人制）橄欖球（比賽）應該還有十分鐘左右，就會對江蘇，爭入明日的決賽，我們對他們充滿信心。

記者：今次是否第一次看何詩蓓比賽？私底下有否為她加油？你覺得她剛才表現怎樣？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：對，這是我第一次。平日在電視看直播，感覺200米好像游很久，因為播着近鏡，但原來現場觀看很快便游完，所以一直很緊張。但是因為詩蓓由頭帶到尾，我們就安心一點。我當然私下有支持（何詩蓓），公開也有支持。詩蓓還有三個項目，希望她在這個強項拿到金牌，讓她在往後的項目也繼續報捷。

記者：剛剛看到局長跟一些運動員見面，有甚麼交流？談過甚麼？有甚麼鼓勵說話？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：剛才跟泳隊運動員見面，很多其實還是中學生，剛剛在世青（世界青年游泳錦標賽）也拿了很多獎牌回來。我固然很開心見到大師姐詩蓓有這麼好的成績，同時也很開心我們有梯隊了，下面的青少年運動員也開始冒起，香港泳隊的發展將會越來越好。

記者：手球方面，早前你說過答應了他們會提供一些場地支援，是永久場地還是永久的資助？是否因為他們有成績，還是你覺得應該要給他們多點資助？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：永久（場地），大家都知道在香港來說是不容易的，但我們要解決的是燃眉之急，所以即使我現在說興建一個永久場地，也未必立刻幫助到手球隊，所以我們想的辦法會是即時幫到他們的一些辦法。我已經跟同事、體育專員和康文署（康樂及文化事務署）開會，希望很快有好消息。我們也要和（中國香港）手球總會談談，這是不是他們需要的東西，但是已經有進展了。

至於是否好成績就會幫助多一些，我想這是有一定關係的。近年我們對體育投入這麼多，運動員交出好成績，我們的投入再多一點，這也很自然的事。但是手球隊的的確確以業餘的姿態，能夠挑戰全國的職業強隊，這一方面令我們很振奮和很值得繼續支持他們。

記者：（國際奧委會終身名譽主席）巴赫提到（粵港澳）大灣區有申辦奧運會的一切條件，這是未來會考慮的發展方向嗎？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：巴赫先生對整個（粵港澳）大灣區的評價這麼高，我們很榮幸和很開心。正如我們早前也回答過大家的問題，申辦奧運的的確確不只是香港的事，也不是整個（粵港澳）大灣區的事，而是一個國家的行為。現階段我們繼續辦好全運會和殘特奧會（全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會）。當然總結經驗後，大家會知道，我們有過這次粵港澳大灣區通力合作舉辦一屆精彩的全運會，簡約、安全、精彩（的全運會），往後其實沒有事是不可能的。謝謝大家。"
"CHP recorded two cases of chikungunya fever today, one locally acquired and one imported",2025-11-13 21:36,2025-11-13 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300831.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 13), two new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) have been recorded, one locally acquired and one imported. The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest case information
------------------------------
The local case involves a 68-year-old female living in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan. A preliminary investigation revealed thatshe developed joint pain on November 10, and a fever and rash the following day. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department ofPamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on November 11. Her blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. According to preliminary information, the patient had no travel history in the past two months. The case is classified as local. The patient's residence and usual activity areas do not overlap with areas where imported or local cases have been recorded in recent months. The CHP will carry out a genome analysis to ascertain whether the patient has epidemiological linkage with other cases in Hong Kong. Investigation is ongoing.

The imported case involves an 83-year-old male living in Foshan in Guangdong. He visited Hong Kong on November 10, staying temporarily in Sham Shui Po District. He developed a fever and joint pain that day and attended the Princess Margaret Hospital yesterday (November 12). His blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. Since the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected when he was in Guangdong Province. The case is classified as imported.

The above two patients have been admitted to hospitals for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. They are currently in stable condition. The 68-year-old female patient has two household contacts and the 83-year-old male patient has one. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

As of 5pm today, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 61 confirmed CF cases this year. Four of these cases were local, and the rest were imported.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-------------------------------------------------------------
In response to the new local case, the CHP, together with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), have inspected various locations in the vicinity of patient's residence and conducted mosquito control operations today with a view to minimising the risk of local transmission.

The CHP urged the residents living nearby Tung Hei Court to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP officers and the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams will contact the local residents to remind them to be aware of relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

The CHP will set up a health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre, Yiu Hing Road, Shau Kei Wan from tomorrow (November 14) to provide assessments to residents with relevant symptoms. The inquiry hotline (2125 2373), which was set up earlier, will continue to operate daily from 9am to 6pm.

The CHP will also collaborate with the Eastern District Office to organise a health talk for local residents at the Kwan Kai Ming Memorial Chung Hok Elderly Centre of Women's Welfare Club Western District Hong Kong. The talk will take place at 5.30pm tomorrow on G/F, Hing Hong House, Hing Tung Estate. The aim is to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others.

The CHP will send another round of letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to be vigilant. If there are any suspected CF cases, they should contact the CHP for follow up immediately.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------
Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

最新個案資料
——————

本地個案涉及一名68歲女子，住所位於筲箕灣東熹苑。初步調查顯示，她於十一月十日出現關節痛，翌日出現發燒及皮疹，同日到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院急症室求醫。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。根據初步所得資料，病人近兩個月沒有外遊，屬本地感染個案。她的住所和日常活動範圍與近月的輸入或本地個案沒有重疊的地方，中心會對病毒進行基因分析，以判斷她是否與本港早前錄得的個案有流行病學關連，調查仍在進行中。

輸入個案涉及一名83歲男子，長居於廣東省佛山市。他於十一月十日訪港，暫居於深水埗區，同日出現發燒及關節痛，昨日（十一月十二日）到瑪嘉烈醫院求醫，他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。由於病人在潛伏期內身處廣東省，中心認為他是在廣東省期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。

兩名病人已獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。68歲女子和83歲男子分別有兩名和一名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

截至今日下午五時，本港今年累計錄得61宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

針對新增一宗本地個案，中心今日已聯同食物環境衞生署（食環署）人員實地視察患者家居附近一帶的地點，並進行滅蚊，減低本地傳播的風險。

中心呼籲東熹苑一帶居民，如於十月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和東區關愛隊會接觸有關居民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

明日（十一月十四日）起，中心將在筲箕灣耀興道興東商場二樓設立醫護站，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估，而早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）會繼續由上午九時至下午六時運作。

明日下午五時三十分，中心將會與東區民政事務處在興東邨興康樓地下香港西區婦女福利會關啟明紀念松鶴老人中心合辦教育講座，以期加深市民對這種蚊傳疾病的認識，一同參與防控工作，護己護人。

中心會再次發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺，如有懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱個案，立即通知中心跟進。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another fatal case of paediatric influenza infection recorded,2025-11-13 19:08,2025-11-13 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300736.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health earlier announceda case of severe paediatric influenza A infection in an 11-month-old boy. The boy was hospitalised for over two weeks and unfortunately passed away today (November 13) due to complications. The CHP reiterated its appeal to schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

  ""The boy had underlying illness. This is the second fatal case of paediatric influenza infection. Including this case, nine cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes in September, with only one having received this year's SIV prior to the onset of illness. To avoid recurrence of such tragedies, I urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly, especially high-risk groups such as children, the elderly, and adults with underlying illnesses and immunosuppression. Apart from receiving the SIV through various programmes launched by the Government, members of the public may also contact their family doctors to arrange vaccinations,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

  ""Although, according to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity began to decline in the last week of October, it still remains at a relatively high level. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Based on past experience, Hong Kong's winter influenza season typically occurs between January and March. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that a winter influenza season may occur early next year. I urge parents to arrange SIV for their children as soon as possible, and hope all sectors of society could join hands in educating parents on the importance of vaccination. This will promote a greater vaccine uptake among young children, increase the vaccination coverage rate, and strengthen protection for children,"" Dr Tsui added.

  He emphasised that although a genetically mutated influenza A (H3N2) virus strain has recently emerged in Hong Kong and many other regions, the currently used SIV remains effective against this antigenically drifted strain, as well as other influenza A and influenza B viruses. Therefore, the SIV is still one of the most effective methods to prevent influenza and its complications and can reduce the risk of serious complications or death from infection.

  Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to anAccident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

  Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

  For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

食環署今日舉辦本年度的傑出廁所事務員頒獎禮，由食環署署長吳文傑頒發獎項予獲選的廁所事務員。三位獲選的傑出男廁所事務員分別服務於沙田區馬料水海濱公廁、大埔區放馬莆公廁和油尖區科學館道公廁；而三位獲選的傑出女廁所事務員分別服務於沙田區馬料水海濱公廁、南區香港仔大道公廁和大埔區放馬莆公廁。吳文傑讚揚他們辛勤工作，敬業樂業，確保公共廁所衞生整潔和設施運作良好，讓使用者感到滿意。

食環署近年來多管齊下，提升轄下公廁的設施、管理和衞生水平，為使用者帶來更好的使用體驗。食環署積極善用科技提升公廁服務，例如已在15間公廁裝設傳感器，實時監測人流和環境參數，當偵測到異味濃度升至警報級別，系統會即時透過短訊通知負責人安排清潔；使用嶄新空氣淨化技術將污染物催化分解，從根源消除異味；並在個別公廁利用臭氧機將空氣中的氧氣轉換成臭氧，通過納米氣泡技術，有效氧化水中的細菌和病毒，防止生物膜在座廁表面形成及減低排泄物產生的異味。

To acknowledge their contributions, the FEHD recently conducted an assessment to recognise outstanding toilet attendants. After a thorough assessment, six outstanding toilet attendants were selected for commendation.

The FEHD held this year's Outstanding Toilet Attendant Award Presentation Ceremony today, where the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene, Mr Donald Ng, presented awards to the selected toilet attendants. Three male toilet attendants serving at the Ma Liu Shui Waterfront Public Toilet in Sha Tin District, the Fong Ma Po Public Toilet in Tai Po District and the Science Museum Road Public Toilet in Yau Tsim District respectively, and three female toilet attendants serving at the Ma Liu Shui Waterfront Public Toilet in Sha Tin District, the Aberdeen Main Road Public Toilet in Southern District and the Fong Ma Po Public Toilet in Tai Po District respectively were selected. Mr Ng praised the awardees for their diligence, professionalism and commitment to ensuring the hygiene and cleanliness of PTs and the proper operation of toilet facilities, bringing satisfactory experiences for the users.

In recent years, the FEHD has been enhancing the facilities, management and hygiene of PTs taking a multipronged approach to provide a better user experience for the public. The FEHD actively employs technologies to enhance the service of PTs. For instance, sensors have been installed in 15 PTs to monitor usage rates and environmental parameters in real time, so that when the concentration of odour reaches an alarming level, the system will immediately notify the responsible staff through an SMS message to arrange a cleaning. Additionally, novel air purification technologies are utilised to catalytically decompose pollutants and to eliminate the odour. Ozone generators are also deployed in individual PTs to convert the oxygen in the air to ozone. The use of nano bubble technology can effectively oxidise the bacteria and viruses in water, preventing the formation of biofilms on toilet surfaces and reducing odours generated from excreta.

The FEHD has also installed wireless broadcasting systems in approximately 200 PTs at tourist attractions or with high utilisation rates across the territory to promote the importance of toilet cleanliness and proper use of the facilities. Furthermore, public toilet cleaning services are gradually being separated from the street cleaning service contracts and procured independently under dedicated contracts. Provisions requiring toilet attendants to have received relevant vocational training with recognised qualifications are included in the new public toilet management service contracts with a view to upgrading the service standards.

The spokesman said, ""The FEHD will continue to enhance the facilities and service quality of PTs through innovative ideas, and we appeal to the public to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of public facilities and help ensure that PTs are well cared for."""

​香港海關葵涌搗破懷疑私煙貯存倉庫（附圖）,2025-11-13 18:26,2025-11-13 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300697.htm,"香港海關昨日（十一月十二日）在葵涌搗破一個懷疑私煙貯存倉庫，檢獲約二十四萬支懷疑私煙，估計市值約一百零八萬元，應課稅值約七十九萬元，並拘捕五名懷疑涉案人士。

海關透過情報分析及深入調查，發現有私煙集團利用酒店房間作私煙貯存倉庫，並於昨日下午在葵涌一間酒店內截查四名可疑男子，在他們擺放於行李車上的尼龍袋中檢獲約八萬支懷疑私煙，遂把他們拘捕。其後，海關人員押解他們到酒店內一個房間搜查，再檢獲約十六萬支懷疑私煙，並於房間內拘捕另一名男子。五名被捕男子年齡介乎二十二歲至五十二歲。

海關相信被捕人士為減低被海關偵查的風險，刻意利用酒店房間作為暫存倉庫，並以螞蟻搬家的形式分發私煙。是次行動已經成功瓦解一個利用酒店房間貯存和分發私煙的犯罪集團。海關會繼續追查私煙的來源及去向，不排除會有更多人被捕。

五名被捕男子已被落案控以「處理應課稅品條例適用的貨品」罪，將於明日（十一月十四日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。

海關強調買賣私煙同屬違法。根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"

Through intelligence analysis and after a thorough investigation, Customs discovered that a cigarette smuggling syndicate had been using hotel rooms as illicit cigarette storage centres, and intercepted four suspicious men at a hotel in Kwai Chung yesterday afternoon. About 80 000 suspected illicit cigarettes were seized from their nylon bags on a luggage cart, and they were subsequently arrested. Later, Customs officers escorted them to a room within the hotel for a search and further seized 160 000 suspected illicit cigarettes, and arrested another man in the room. The five arrested men were aged between 22 and 52.

Customs believes that the arrestees deliberately made use of hotel rooms as temporary storage centres and distributed illicit cigarettes in the mode of an ""ant-moving-home"" to reduce the risk of being detected by Customs. This operation successfully dismantled a syndicate that utilised hotel rooms for the storage and distribution of illicit cigarettes. Customs will continue to trace the source and flow of the illicit cigarettes. The likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

The five arrested men were charged with ""dealing with goods to which the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance applies"" and will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (November 14).

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that it is an offence to buy or sell illicit cigarettes. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

再有兒童感染流感離世　衞生防護中心呼籲學童盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-13 18:07,2025-11-13 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300701.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）早前公布一名11個月大男嬰感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，男嬰留院逾兩周，因併發症延至今日（十一月十三日）不治。中心再次呼籲學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「男嬰有長期病患，是今年第二宗兒童感染流感後不幸離世的個案。計及這宗個案，本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃由九月展開後已錄得九宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案，當中只有一人曾在發病前接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。為避免類似的不幸事件發生，我呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗，務必立即行動，尤其是高風險群組，例如兒童、長者、患有慢性疾病和免疫抑制的成年人。市民除了透過政府的各項計劃接種季節性流感疫苗，亦可以聯絡自己的家庭醫生安排接種。」

徐樂堅醫生續說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度在十月最後一周開始回落，但仍然處於較高水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆。根據過往經驗，香港冬季流感季節大多於一至三月出現，因此不排除明年初會出現冬季流感季節。我呼籲家長盡早安排子女參加流感疫苗接種，並希望社會各界攜手教導家長接種疫苗的重要性，以推動更多幼童接種疫苗，提高覆蓋率，加強保障小朋友。」

他強調，雖然帶基因突變的甲型流感（H3N2）病毒株近期在本港和不少地區出現，但現時使用的季節性流感疫苗對該抗原漂移病毒株、以至其他甲型和乙型流感仍具保護作用，所以接種流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

The song features nearly 70 singers and artists, including representatives from the seven local electronic media outlets. The music video of the theme song was premiered at the press conference and will continue to be broadcast across various platforms to encourage the public to cast their votes on the polling day.

It plays a vital role in accelerating Hong Kong's economic development and improving people's livelihoods. The Government once again calls on all electors to actively participate and cast their votes on the polling day to elect capable, responsible, passionate and pragmatic candidates to be new-term LegCo Members, who will work together with the Government to create a brighter future for Hong Kong."""

  ""To dovetail with the national strategy of developing 'patient capital' and further promote the effective collaboration among the Government, industry, academia, research and investment sectors, the Government has set up the ITIF to give play to the guiding and leveraging roles of government funding to channel more social capital to invest in innovation and technology (I&T) industries and support the development of emerging and future industries of strategic importance,"" a spokesman for the Commission said.

With a funding allocation of $10 billion approved by the Legislative Council, the ITIF will invest in five thematic areas, namely (a) life and health technology, (b) artificial intelligence and robotics, (c) semi-conductors and smart devices, (d) digitalisation, upgrading and transformation, and (e) future and sustainable development. In order to guide market capital participation, the Government will play the role of ""setting the stage"", in a bid to attract more strategic investors. Each of the strategic investors shall commit no less than $3 billion, as limited partners (LPs), to invest alongside the Government into sub-funds under the various thematic areas. The Government will select eligible professional fund managers to set up the sub-funds. In addition to the contributions from the Government and strategic investors, the fund managers should also bring in other market investors to participate as LPs to make a contribution to the sub-funds. The capital commitment from the Government is capped at $1 billion to each sub-fund and will not exceed 25 per cent of the fund size of each sub-fund. The overall target size of the sub-funds is at least $40 billion.

Each of the selected fund managers shall act as a general partner of the sub-funds and is responsible for setting up a limited partnership fund in Hong Kong, with a minimum fund size of $2 billion (including the contribution of the Government), raising non-government capital for the sub-fund, managing the day-to-day operations of the sub-fund, identifying investment targets according to the investment mandate, providing support to the investee companies and producing regular reports. The assessment criteria for fund managers include the applicant's background, management team's resources, investment strategy and processes, investment performance, company resources, experience and contributions, fundraising capabilities as well as fees, and would seek the advice from the Steering Committee.

Furthermore, the Government welcomes more strategic investors to participate in the ITIF, jointly promoting the development of I&T industries in Hong Kong.

外匯基金截至二○二五年九月底的財務狀況,2025-11-13 16:30,2025-11-13 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300586.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十一月十三日）公布外匯基金截至二○二五年九月底未經審計的財務狀況。

外匯基金在二○二五年首三季錄得2,740億港元的投資收入，其主要組成部分包括:


債券投資收益1,126億港元；
香港股票投資收益401億港元；
其他股票投資收益595億港元；
非港元資產外匯估值上調（註一）302億港元；及
其他投資收益（註二）316億港元。


二○二五年外匯基金支付予財政儲備存款與香港特別行政區政府基金及法定組織存款的息率為4.4%，首三季相關費用分別為123億港元（註三）及118億港元。

二○二五年九月底外匯基金的總資產為41,522億港元，較二○二四年底增加712億港元，而其累計盈餘為9,163億港元。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「踏入第三季，央行貨幣政策、地緣政治局勢及人工智能熱潮等因素共同利好投資環境。全球主要資產類別表現大致向好，其中主要股票市場指數於季內再創新高。港股受惠於資金流入，於第三季上升約12%。債市方面，雖然美聯儲在九月再次減息，但美元債券收益率依然處於較高水平，外匯基金持有的債券組合繼續獲得不錯的利息收入。不過，美元兌其他主要貨幣在第三季轉強，為外匯基金帶來一些資產外匯估值下調。總體而言，外匯基金在二○二五年首九個月錄得不俗的投資收入，各主要資產類別均實現正回報。」

他續說：「展望二○二五年餘下時間，投資環境仍然高度不明朗。雖然預期美聯儲繼續減息或會利好投資氣氛，但市場對美國經濟前景的關注仍會持續。此外，美國政府的經貿政策、貿易摩擦和地緣政治局勢的反覆變化對金融市場的影響仍然難以預測。

面對複雜多變的投資環境，金管局會繼續堅守『保本先行、長期增值』的原則，謹慎而靈活地管理外匯基金。我們會作出適當的防禦性部署，並維持高流動性，亦會持續多元化投資，致力提高外匯基金的長期投資回報，確保外匯基金能繼續有效維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。」

註一：主要為外幣資產在扣除匯率對沖部分後換算至港元所產生的估值變動。
註二：這是外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的投資的估值變動。有關數字反映二○二五年六月底的估值，尚未包括七至九月份的估值變動。
註三：未包括二○二五年度應支付予未來基金的款項。有關數字需待二○二五年的綜合息率確定後方可公布。"

二零二五年首九個月與二零二四年同期比較，香港的商品整體出口貨量及進口貨量分別上升11.3%及10.8%。

經季節性調整的數字顯示，二零二五年第三季與對上一季比較，商品整體出口貨量下跌0.8%，而商品進口貨量則大致維持不變。

二零二五年首九個月與二零二四年同期比較，商品整體出口價格及進口價格均上升1.9%。

對外商品貿易的價格變動是以對外商品貿易的單位價格指數變動反映。這指數是根據平均單位價值或個別商品的實際價格來計算。

貿易價格比率指數是根據商品整體出口價格指數與商品進口價格指數的比率計算出來。與二零二四年同期比較，這指數在二零二五年九月上升0.4%，而在二零二五年首九個月則大致維持不變。

表1載列按主要目的地劃分的商品整體出口單位價格和貨量的變動情況。

二零二五年九月與二零二四年九月比較，輸往所有主要目的地的整體出口貨量均錄得升幅：越南（46.1%）、台灣（25.6%）、印度（15.4%）、中國內地（內地）（14.8%）及美國（4.3%）。

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-11-13 16:30,2025-11-13 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300579.htm,"An incoming female passenger was sentenced to 40 days' imprisonment and fined $4,000 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (November 13) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted a 51-year-old incoming female passenger on October 12 at the Lo Wu Control Point and seized 4 381 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $17,900 and a duty potential of about $14,400 from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

gains on bonds of HK$112.6 billion;
gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$40.1 billion;
gains on other equities of HK$59.5 billion;
positive currency translation effect of HK$30.2 billion on
	non-Hong Kong dollar assets (Note 1); and
gains on other investments of HK$31.6 billion (Note 2).


Fees on placements by the Fiscal Reserves and placements by Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government funds and statutory bodies were HK$12.3 billion (Note 3) and HK$11.8 billion respectively in the first three quarters of 2025, with the rate of fee payment at 4.4 per cent for 2025.

Total assets of the Exchange Fund stood at HK$4,152.2 billion at end-September 2025, representing an increase of HK$71.2 billion from the end of 2024. Accumulated surplus reached HK$916.3 billion at end-September 2025.

The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, said, ""Stepping into the third quarter, various factors such as central bank monetary policies, the geopolitical environment and the fervor around the artificial intelligence industry were generally positive to the investment environment. Major asset classes delivered positive returns, with some leading stock market indices setting new highs during the quarter. Benefitting from capital inflows, the Hong Kong stock market also rose by 12 per cent in the third quarter. As for the bond market, while the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut its monetary policy target rate in September, US bond yields remained at relatively high levels, generating good interest income for the Exchange Fund's bond portfolio. That said, the US dollar traded stronger against other major currencies during the third quarter, resulted in a negative currency translation effect on the Exchange Fund's assets. Overall, the Exchange Fund recorded decent investment income in the first nine months of 2025, with positive returns across major asset classes.""

He added, ""The investment landscape remains highly uncertain for the rest of 2025. While expectations of further rate cuts by the US Fed may improve investment sentiment, the market's concerns about the US's economic outlook may remain. Further, the impact of the rapid changes in the US Government economic and trade policies, trade frictions and geopolitical tensions on the financial markets remains unpredictable.

In the face of the complex and volatile investment environment, the HKMA will continue to adhere to the principle of capital preservation first while maintaining long-term growth. We will continue to manage the Exchange Fund with prudence and
flexibility, implement appropriate defensive measures, and maintain a high degree of liquidity. We will also continue our
investment diversification to strive for higher long-term returns, and ensure that the Exchange Fund remains effective in achieving its purpose of maintaining monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.""

Note 1: This is primarily the effect of translating foreign currency assets into Hong Kong dollar after deducting the portion for currency hedging.
Note 2: This is the valuation change of investments held by investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. This figure reflects the valuations at the end of June 2025. Valuation changes of these investments from July to September are not yet available.
Note 3: This does not include the 2025 fee payment to the Future Fund because such amount will only be disclosed when the composite rate for 2025 is available."
DPO organises digital economy exchange activities to promote digital collaboration between Beijing and Hong Kong (with photos),2025-11-13 16:08,2025-11-13 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300533.htm,"âThe Digital Policy Office (DPO) and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology organised the Digital Economy Going Global Thematic Promotion Session in Hong Kong today (November 13). There, experts, academics and enterprise representatives from both places engaged in extensive discussions and exchanges on further promoting Beijing-Hong Kong collaboration in innovation and technology (I&T) as well as driving the digital economy. The theme of the Session was ""Beijing-Hong Kong Digital Connectivity: Building a Collaborative International Digital Economy Ecosystem"".

In her welcoming remarks, the Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Ms Lillian Cheong, shared Hong Kong's role and actions of promoting international co-operation in the digital economy. The digital economy has already become a core engine of global high-quality economic development, as well as contributing to the reshaping of the competition landscape. Technologies such as cloud computing, blockchain, big data, and AI have not only fostered countless new industries and business models, but have also enabled more efficient cross-border collaborations and an optimised allocation of global resources. Beijing, as the country's hub for technological innovation and the digital economy, has leading advantages in core technologies, industrial systems, and the creation of application scenarios. Hong Kong, leveraging the advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" framework, serves as a ""super connector"" bridging the Mainland and the world. Hong Kong's regulations with international standards, top-tier research capabilities, convergence of international talent, and its advantages in international data flow provide unique support for the cross-border movement of digital elements and international technological co-operation. The strong partnership between the two places creates an ideal situation for building a collaborative ecosystem for international co-operation.

Ms Cheong added that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government attaches great importance to AI development and identifies it as a core industry. Over the past few years, the Government has been actively planning and promoting the advancement of AI technologies and applications on multiple fronts. Ms Cheong took the opportunity to invite Chinese Mainland enterprises attending the Promotion Session to seize AI opportunities together with Hong Kong and jointly build a collaborative ecosystem for international co-operation, thereby making greater contributions to the nation's high-quality development and the building of a great country.

  Ms Cheong presented certificates to the successful enterprises of the Beijing-Hong Kong AI Application Accelerator and witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Hong Kong Cyberportand the Beijing Go Global Hub for Digital Enterprises.

The Assistant Commissioner (Mainland and Industry Collaboration) of the DPO, Ms Cari Wu, chaired a roundtable dialogue at the event on the same day, leading guests to engage in in-depth discussions and exchanges on ways to collaborate, including a future Beijing-Hong Kong co-operation mechanism, leveraging resource complementarity between Beijing and Hong Kong, and promoting enterprises going global.

Additionally, Ms Wu attended the Beijing-Hong Kong Digital Economy Enterprise Going Global Service Seminar yesterday (November 12) which was well received, drawing active participation from industry experts and insiders from both Beijing and Hong Kong. The seminar aimed to provide a collaborative platform, harnessing the wisdom and strengths of both places to explore how to integrate the policy advantages, service resources and enterprise powers of Beijing and Hong Kong to jointly construct an innovative ecosystem to expand the digital economy and go global.

At the seminar, Ms Wu shared Hong Kong's policies and efforts in assisting Chinese Mainland technology enterprises to go global. This year's Policy Address proposed the establishment of a one-stop platform, the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global, which was set up early last month and has commenced its work. Ms Wu expressed gratitude to one of the organisers of the seminar, the Hong Kong China Friendship Association, which has brought together a vast network of economic, professional services, and technology talent in Hong Kong, Macao and overseas, serving as a strong support for the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global.

In addition, the Commissioner for Digital Policy, Mr Tony Wong, held an insightful exchange session on topics such as promoting digital government, data governance and smart city development with the delegation from the Beijing Municipal Administration of Government Services and Data Administration on November 11. The delegation was led by Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Government and Party Secretary and Director of the Beijing Municipal Administration of Government Services and Data Management, Mr Shen Binhua. Mr Wong and representatives of the DPO shared Hong Kong's latest developments on digital government, data governance, digital infrastructure and the 1823 hotline service. The delegation also visited the 1823 Contact Centre to understand the centre's daily operations and its application of I&T.

The exchange session has deepened the understanding of the digital economy and digital government developments between Beijing and Hong Kong, laying a solid foundation for driving high-quality development in smart city matters across both places."

"Free horticultural education exhibition ""Exploring the Amazing Bulbous Plants"" to be held at Kowloon Park November 15 and 16 (with photos)",2025-11-13 15:30,2025-11-13 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300394.htm,"  To raise public interest in planting and promote greening, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department will organise a horticultural education exhibition entitled ""Exploring the Amazing Bulbous Plants"" this weekend (November 15 and 16) from 10am to 5pm at the Arcade and the Green Education and Resource Centre of Kowloon Park. The two-day event will also feature pot-planting activities, game stalls, workshops, talks and guided tours. All are welcome and admission is free.

 Bulbous plants generally refer to herbaceous plants with enlarged underground stems or roots that serve as storage organs. Packed with nutrients, water, and buds essential for growth, these specialised underground structures allow the plant to remain dormant during harsh conditions, such as cold winters, hot summers, or drought, and they quickly sprout and bloom when seasons return favourable. Therefore, bulbous plants are hailed as nature's ""master of energy storage"".

 Through the exhibition, members of the public can learn more about the classification, selection and pre-planting preparation, planting steps and practical tips, plant care and propagation methods of bulbous plants. Some beginner-friendly species that are easy to care for, have distinct blooming periods, and offer great visual appeal will also be introduced.

 In addition to exhibition panels, there will be hands-on workshops for creating scented sachets, bookmarks featuring compressed flowers, and plant rubbing art, alongside game stalls. Visitors can also enjoy the fun of pot planting under the guidance of horticulture instructors.

 Two talks in Cantonese, namely ""Protected Plants in Hong Kong"" and ""How to plant Bulbous Plants"", will be held at the Green Education and Resource Centre in Kowloon Park from 12.15pm to 1pm on November 15 and 16 respectively. All are welcome to participate. While admission is free, tickets are required and available at the Centre on the event day on a first-come, first served basis.
