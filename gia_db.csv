展望將來，由於本地成本及外圍價格壓力仍然溫和，整體通脹短期內應保持輕微。

According to the Composite CPI, overall consumer prices rose by 1.4% in December 2025 over the same month a year earlier, larger than the corresponding increase (1.2%) in November 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in December 2025 was 1.2%, also larger than that in November 2025 (1.0%). The larger increase was mainly due to the increases in the charges for package tours as well as inbound and outbound transport fares.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of increase in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending December 2025 was 0.2%, and that for the 3-month period ending November 2025 was 0.1%. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of increase were 0.2% and 0.1%.

  Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.5%, 1.3% and 1.4% respectively in December 2025, as compared to 1.5%, 1.1% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.0%, 1.2% and 1.4% respectively in December 2025, as compared to 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.1% respectively in November 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending December 2025, the average monthly rates of change in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. The corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending November 2025 were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending December 2025 were 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3% respectively, and the corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending November 2025 were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.1% respectively.

  Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in December 2025 for transport (4.3%), miscellaneous services (2.3%), alcoholic drinks and tobacco (2.0%), housing (1.6%), miscellaneous goods (1.2%), meals out and takeaway food (1.1%), and basic food (0.7%).

  On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in December 2025 for durable goods (-2.6%), clothing and footwear (-1.7%), and electricity, gas and water (-1.6%).

  In the fourth quarter of 2025, the Composite CPI rose by 1.3% over a year earlier, while the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) rose by 1.4%, 1.2% and 1.2% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.0%, 1.1% and 1.2% respectively.

  For 2025 as a whole, the Composite CPI was 1.4% higher than that in the preceding year. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.9%, 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.3%, 1.0% and 1.0% respectively.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed modest in December 2025. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.2% in the month over a year earlier, giving an annual increase of 1.1% for 2025 as a whole, same as the preceding year. Price pressures on various major components remained generally contained.

  Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay modest in the near term, as domestic cost and external price pressures are still mild.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (January 22) the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (Hong Kong Taxonomy) Phase 2A, marking an important step in facilitating green and sustainable capital flows and supporting the region's transition to a low‑carbon economy.

The HKMA has been developing the Hong Kong Taxonomy in phases to provide a robust and transparent framework for classifying economic activities that contribute to green and sustainable development. Following the release of Phase 1 in May 2024, the HKMA launched a public consultation on the Phase 2A prototype in September 2025 to seek views on the expanded taxonomy coverage and relevant enhancements.

The HKMA received numerous submissions from a diverse group of stakeholders, including banks, professional associations, asset managers, corporates, non-government organisations, think tank, and the public sector. Respondents generally supported the expansion in taxonomy coverage and the addition of transition elements and climate change adaptation category, and welcomed the further enhancement in clarity and practicality of the Hong Kong Taxonomy by the HKMA.

Drawing on the feedback gathered from the public consultation, the HKMA has refined the prototype for publication as the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance Phase 2A. The HKMA also released a consultation report, which summarises the consultation feedback and the HKMA's responses.

The Hong Kong Taxonomy is a living document. Development of the next phase is underway and will continue to be informed by market developments, government policies, industry priorities, and the latest technological advancements. The HKMA remains committed to actively engaging with market participants and broader stakeholders throughout the development process.

主席：

我感謝嚴剛議員、提出修正案的兩位議員及其他發言議員的寶貴意見及建議，我想就人才方面的工作扼要回應。

國家在「十五五」規劃建議中，再次明確支持港澳打造國際高端人才集聚高地，為香港人力政策指明清晰方向。為更有效推進香港人力及科技協同發展，政府成立了由政務司司長親自領導的「教育、科技和人才委員會」，從頂層統籌相關政策局，推動教育科技人才融合發展，建設國際教育及人才樞紐，全面配合國家推進科教興國的策略。

「十五五」規劃明確提出要加快建設國家戰略人才力量，引進和培育世界優秀人才。特區政府將全力配合。除加強本地人才培訓外，本屆政府亦着力招攬外來人才，豐富多元人才庫以發揮香港在「一國兩制」框架下的獨特優勢，成為國家人才戰略的重要支點。政府先後推出了多項招攬人才措施，除創新科技及工業局公布的「科技人才入境計劃」優化措施外，勞福局近兩年亦針對「優秀人才入境計劃」及「人才清單」等作出優化。各項措施反應良好，廣受外地人才歡迎。在國際管理發展學院發布的《2025年世界人才排名》中，香港全球排名創新高至第四位，充分反映本屆政府「搶人才」政策方向正確。

自二○二二年底起，逾26萬名人才抵港工作和發展，紓緩人口勞動力不足，支撐經濟持續增長。這些人才攜同超過24萬名受養家眷抵港，包括逾14萬名18歲以下子女。這批年輕一代有助優化人口結構，為香港長遠發展提供人力支撐。

展望未來，我們將繼續鞏固招攬人才的成績，透過人力推算及跟進調查，動態監察人力變化，不時檢視「人才清單」，持續優化計劃細節，吸納合適人才落戶香港。香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）除繼續為來港人才提供一站式支援外，亦積極加強海外推廣，遠赴亞太、歐洲、北美洲和中東地區舉辦宣傳活動，同時強化與內地城市合作，推廣區域發展機遇。人才辦會繼續夥拍內地城市「走出去」，合力招攬海外人才。此外，人才辦將於三月十八日及十九日舉辦「全球人才高峰會周」，進一步打造香港為國際高端人才集聚高地。

香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通國際的優勢，一直匯聚來自世界各地的多元優秀人才。政府會繼續對準香港「八大中心」戰略定位的人力需求，適時優化措施，進一步提升人才庫的多元性，為香港以至國家未來發展提供更強大的人才支撐。

多謝主席。"

主席：

首先，我感謝提出議案的嚴剛議員，亦感謝提出修正案的吳傑莊議員和梁子穎議員，以及40多位議員就推動香港特區融入和服務國家發展大局提出的寶貴意見。以下我將就創科範疇作介紹及回應。

國家在「十四五」規劃和「十五五」規劃建議有高度延續性，均明確支持香港建設國際創科中心。國家「十五五」規劃建議提出，要建設現代化產業體系，加快高水平科技自立自強，引領發展新質生產力。特區政府會全力配合國家科技創新發展策略，積極對接「十五五」規劃發展，並正如很多議員提及的，我們會進一步加強自主創新能力，聚力培育新質生產力，亦會致力推動科技創新和產業創新融合發展，構建以科技創新為主體的新實體經濟。並且我們會進一步加強粵港澳大灣區的聯動發展，更好融入和服務國家發展大局，助力國家實現高品質發展和高水平科技自立自強。

特區政府於二○二二年底公布《香港創新科技發展藍圖》，為香港五至十年間的創科發展制定了頂層設計和戰略規劃。政府在精密布局和完善政策措施的同時，會時刻立足國家科技戰略支點，與時俱進，因時制宜，例如我們圍繞國家和香港重點發展的前沿科技領域，於兩年前特別成立了香港微電子研發院，亦將於今年成立香港人工智能研發院及完成生命健康研發院的籌備工作。我們亦剛推出「前沿科技研究支援計劃」，以進一步正如很多議員都特別點出的吸引更多國際頂尖科技人才，並且加強香港原始創新和關鍵核心技術攻關能力，以香港所長更好對接國家「十五五時期」的前沿科技戰略部署，貢獻國家所需。

此外，特區政府會配合國家的創科發展和產業部署戰略，着力帶動高增值的先進製造，加快扶植新興產業，促進新型工業化，實現科技創新和產業創新融入發展。在這方面，我們先後提出了三項100億元計劃，包括大家也提及到的支持院校聯同業界將研發成果轉化的「產學研1+計劃」，亦有助力從事策略性產業的企業在香港建設新智能生產設施的「新型工業加速計劃」，以及加強引導更多市場資金共同投資於指定策略性新興和未來產業的「創科產業引導基金」。

我們亦會主動部署積極對接，包括於去年十二月就香港新型工業中長期發展展開研究，探討如何主動對接國家「十五五」規劃，融入國家新型工業化整體布局，以在國家構建現代化產業體系中發揮香港的獨特作用。同時，我們亦透過構建創科生態圈的措施，發揮香港高水平對外開放及「以產聚才」的作用，助力打造國際高端人才集聚高地。

再者，香港循着國家部署，優化調整創科布局。在科學園及數碼港這兩大創科園區的基礎上，河套香港園區已在去年底正式開園，香港正形成以三大創科園區、五大研發機構的新發展格局。其中我們着力加快河套香港園區和新田一帶創科用地的發展，兩者將形成上中下游協同發展的重要紐帶，為創科產業提供全鏈條支持，亦作為更好對接粵港澳大灣區和國家戰略發展的重大科技平台。

主席，我再次感謝多位議員就創科發展提出的寶貴意見。今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，創新科技及工業局將會堅定不移地實現香港成為國際創科中心的願景，積極融入和服務國家發展大局，為國家科技強國建設作出貢獻。本人謹此陳辭。"

主席：

感謝嚴剛議員提出的議案及吳傑莊議員和梁子穎議員的修正案，亦感謝40多位議員就議案提供的寶貴意見。就鞏固和提升香港作為國際航運中心及國際航空樞紐的地位方面，我在此作一些回應。

國家在二十屆四中全會通過的「十五五」規劃建議中再次明確表示要鞏固提升香港作為國際航運中心地位，為香港港口和航運服務的發展打下強心針。政府近年一直全速落實各項發展策略及措施以推動香港航運發展。在二○二五年，我們在多個範疇取得顯著進展，包括成立高層次的香港海運港口發展局以制訂長遠策略；成功進行液化天然氣船對船首次加注示範及多次商業化加注作業；以及完成港口社區系統的構建工作，為系統正式全面投入服務做好準備。

展望二○二六年，運輸及物流局將採取多管齊下的策略，進一步提升香港航運業的韌性及競爭力，當中包括全力構建「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系，拓展貨物腹地至內陸省市。我們將於今年內修訂相關法例，除了進一步優化現有航運業稅務優惠措施並引入大宗商品貿易商半稅優惠外，亦會進一步革新香港船舶註冊制度，提升註冊安排的靈活性，以吸引更多船舶在香港註冊。為加強香港在高增值海運服務的領先地位，我們會加大力度推廣稅務優惠，並透過新資助計劃擴大海事保險業務及人才庫。

國際航空樞紐方面，我們將循多方面推展一系列政策措施，以積極配合「十五五」規劃建議。我們會積極擴展本港航空網絡，策略性地吸引本地及非本地的航空公司開拓新航點和航班，優先聚焦具進一步發展潛力及新增長點的地區。同時，我們亦致力加強與粵港澳大灣區城市合作，完善大灣區多式聯運網絡。

低空經濟發展方面，香港會積極響應國家「十五五」規劃建議的戰略部署，致力發展低空經濟，以創新科技驅動區域協同發展。香港將充分發揮「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，全力在法例檢討、基礎設施建設、拓展應用場景等方面推動低空經濟發展。

除了推動低空經濟的本地應用外，我們亦重點推動跨境低空經濟活動。政府已主動與內地相關單位對接，並建立了合作溝通機制，就跨境低空飛行路線規劃、貨物清關機制等關鍵議題展開討論。

我們會繼續與大灣區各城市深化合作，目標是構建跨境低空網絡，促進人流、物流、資訊流的互聯互通，為大灣區的高質量發展注入新動力。

主席：

首先，我衷心感謝動議今日議案的嚴剛議員、提出修正案的吳傑莊議員和梁子穎議員，以及其他39位發言的議員，我們細心聆聽了大家意見。

國家「十四五」規劃實施以來，在中央支持下，香港國際金融中心地位持續鞏固提升。香港穩居全球第三大國際金融中心；去年首次公開招股集資額超過2,800億港元，位列全球第一；股市日均成交近2,500億港元，按年上升九成；資產管理和人民幣結算、融資等業務持續領先；互聯互通機制持續深化。今年是「十五五」規劃開局之年，財經事務及庫務局已制定中長期願景，以「鞏固優勢、創新驅動、內外聯動、安全可控」為原則，推動金融業融入和服務國家發展大局，重點有四方面：

第一，鞏固提升市場優勢。香港市場高度開放和國際化，監管接軌海外、法治穩健、人才匯聚、基建完善、資金和資訊自由流通。我們會繼續提升股票市場競爭力，便利中概股回歸、強化離岸人民幣業務樞紐，提升流動性和產品工具，並會繼續吸引家族辦公室落戶，優化稅制，以加強資產管理業務的競爭力。

第二，開創新增長點，助力實體經濟高質量發展。配合國家「金融五篇大文章」，我們會推動科技金融，協助內地科企來港融資；拓展大宗商品和黃金交易新機遇；加速發展綠色金融，深化與大灣區碳市場試點合作；並探索養老金融，依託香港資產管理及保險業的優勢，開發適配的產品。

第三，深化內外聯動。我們會以滬深港通、債券通、跨境理財通等為基礎，在「十五五」時期將繼續拓展互聯互通，包括推動房地產投資信託基金納入「互聯互通」、推出離岸國債期貨、推進人民幣櫃台納入港股通、優化快速支付系統互聯等，用好大灣區政策「試驗田」。香港也會發揮「超級聯繫人」角色，助力內地企業「走出去」、把海外企業和國際資金「引進來」，吸引企業在港設立財資中心及專屬自保公司，並透過亞洲金融論壇、裕澤香江高峰論壇等金融盛事搭建交流平台，及積極籌備二○二六年亞太經合組織財政部長會議，深化國際合作。

第四，守護金融安全。「十五五」規劃建議強調完善宏觀審慎管理體系。特區（香港特別行政區）政府與監管機構會緊密合作，優化市場監管，防範系統性風險及「黑天鵝」或「灰犀牛」事件，做好風險預案，並將加強與國家金融管理部門協同，完善跨境風險監測。

主席，我們將與立法會及各持份者共同努力，在「十五五」時期鞏固提升香港國際金融中心的地位，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

本人謹此陳辭。多謝主席。"

主席：

我感謝提出議案的嚴剛議員、提出修正案的吳傑莊議員及梁子穎議員，以及一共42位議員提出寶貴意見和建議。接下來，我會從香港作為國際貿易中心方面就議員提出的意見綜合回應。

國家「十五五」規劃正全面開展，當中明確提出要鞏固並提升香港國際貿易中心地位。特區政府會繼續以更積極、更有系統和更全面的策略招商引資，充分發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的雙角色，推動香港更深入地融入和服務國家發展大局。

特區政府成立的內地企業出海專班已經啓動，匯聚各界力量打造一站式平台，通過香港專業高增值服務，為內地企業提供全方位支援，支持內地企業在港設立財資中心和區域總部，並與企業攜手拓展海外市場，讓更多內地企業以香港作為跳板，走向世界。

除了積極支援內地企業「走出去」，香港會持續深化國際交往合作及拓展經貿「朋友圈」，同時把海外企業「引進來」。為提升整體經貿支援的協同效應，商經局已設立「經貿一站通」功能平台，讓海外經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦）、投資推廣署及香港貿易發展局透過這個平台加強協作，互補優勢，三位一體於外地推廣香港的經貿及投資工作。此外，駐吉隆坡經貿辦已於去年十二月正式投入運作，進一步深化在東南亞國家聯盟及周邊國家的經貿和投資推廣。我們會繼續研究把網絡伸延至更多具發展潛力的市場，包括中亞、中東及其他「一帶一路」沿線國家。

二○二五年《施政報告》臚列多項措施，繼續透過「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）、「中小企融資擔保計劃」和香港出口信用保險局支援中小企業。我們亦會繼續促進跨境電商的發展，包括提供財政支援、市場資訊和培訓及舉辦更多宣傳活動等。

在推動貿易文件電子化方面，「貿易單一窗口」第三階段資訊科技系統目標於今年年中開始分批推出服務，便利業界提交「企業對政府」貿易文件。此外，政府正就便利「企業對企業」貿易文件電子化的建議立法框架徵詢業界意見，並會在今年內提出立法建議。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

主席：

今天是第八屆立法會成立以來第二個正式會議，議員便迅速提出有關制訂香港特區發展願景、主動對接國家「十五五」規劃的議案，並在上周的內務委員會會議上通過成立了「香港主動對接國家『十五五』規劃工作小組委員會」。這份積極作為，充分體現議員們心繫國家發展大局和香港長遠繁榮穩定的強烈使命感。我再次感謝嚴剛議員提出議案、吳傑莊議員和梁子穎議員提出修正案，以及各位議員提出的寶貴意見和建議。從大家的發言中，我深深感受到各位對國家「十五五」規劃和香港發展的熱切關心和期待，亦聽到許多創新務實的好建議。這些意見對我們制定主動對接「十五五」規劃的具體政策措施都十分重要。

為加強主動對接國家重大戰略規劃部署，行政長官在二○二二年現屆政府成立之初便已設立了「融入國家發展大局督導組」，負責推進相關工作，協調推動跨局跨部門的政策措施。進入「十五五」時期，督導組將繼續從高層次總攬、協調和監督推動對接「十五五」規劃的各項工作，務求讓全政府各政策局和部門總動員參與對接國家的戰略部署、主動作為。

就議員所提出要為香港制定中長期規劃的建議，行政長官每年發表的《施政報告》，當中的政策方向及措施是具有連貫性的，並高度對接國家的「五年規劃」。而「融入國家發展大局督導組」亦持續指導、監督、統籌各項相關工作。另外，政府亦會就個別重點政策範疇制定發展藍圖，作為中長遠發展的規劃。我十分感謝各位議員今日就如何可以更好地對接國家「十五五」規劃及為香港制定中長遠發展願景出謀獻策，我們會持續不斷完善、優化相關機制。

「十五五」規劃建議為香港發展作出重要部署，支持香港鞏固提升和建設打造「四中心、一高地」的地位。習近平主席已明確指示我們需要錨定目標任務，堅定信心、乘勢而上，紮實推動高質量發展，進一步全面深化改革開放。我們必須要抓緊香港在國家整體發展戰略中的定位，更好服務國家所需，同時帶動香港發展。我現在將發言時間交給其他相關政策局的同事，就如何鞏固提升和建設打造「四中心、一高地」作出介紹和回應。

我謹此致辭，多謝主席。"

As traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, concertgoers should opt for public transport and avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the intervals between trains on the Tuen Ma Line. The last MTR train to Lo Wu Station interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line will depart from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm.

  Concertgoers who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day may also take the KTSP's cross-boundary coach during dispersal. Passengers should purchase tickets from the operators' online platforms in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal.

  The Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (3.30pm to 7pm) and suspended for taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal.

The case involved two unauthorised structures with a total area of about 89 square metres on the flat roof of a composite building on Un Chau Street, Sham Shui Po. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (January 22), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

Hong Kong greenhouse gas emission inventory for 2024 released,2026-01-22 10:10,2026-01-22 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200196.htm,"​The Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) released today (January 22) the 2024 greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventory for Hong Kong.

Hong Kong's GHG emissions continued their downward trend. The total GHG emissions in 2024 amounted to approximately 33.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e), representing a decrease of 3.6 per cent compared with 2023. The per capita GHG emissions continued its downward trend, reaching a new low of 4.41 tonnes CO2-e. It is 3.5 per cent lower than that in 2023 and is about a quarter of that of the United States and 60 per cent of that of the European Union. The carbon intensity was 0.011 kilograms of CO2-e per Hong Kong dollar of GDP, representing a significant decrease of about 6 per cent compared to 2023.

Hong Kong's GHG emissions peaked in 2014. Compared with the emissions peak in 2014, the total emissions, per capita GHG emissions and carbon intensity in 2024 have been reduced by about 27 per cent, 30 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.

According to the latest GHG emission inventory, the three main emission sources in Hong Kong remain to be electricity generation (61 per cent), transport (18 per cent) and waste management (8 per cent). With the gradual replacement of coal with natural gas and zero-carbon energy for electricity generation, popularisation of electric vehicles, reduction in municipal solid waste (MSW) and increase in landfill gas recovery for energy production, Hong Kong's GHG emissions from electricity generation, transport and waste management declined by 3.5 per cent, 3.7 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, compared to 2023. The reduction in GHG emissions from waste management was particularly significant. It was mainly attributable to the 3.4 per cent reduction in the quantity of MSW disposed of at landfills, and a nearly 12 per cent increase in landfill gas recovery for energy production.

To align with the country's ""dual carbon"" target to achieve the peak of carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, the Government will continue to implement the four decarbonisation strategies, namely, net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction, outlined in Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, with a view to reducing Hong Kong's carbon emissions by half from the 2005 levels before 2035 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050.

Details of the 2024 GHG emission inventory have been uploaded to the Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development website (cnsd.gov.hk/en/climate-ready/ghg-emissions-and-trends)."

按最新的溫室氣體排放清單，本地最大的三個排放源仍然為發電（61%）、運輸（18%）及廢物處理（8%）。隨着香港逐步以天然氣和零碳能源取代燃煤發電、推動電動車普及化、減少棄置都市固體廢物、以及增加使用回收堆填氣體來生產能源，這三個排放源的溫室氣體排放量比較二○二三年分別下降3.5%、3.7%及9%。廢物處理的溫室氣體排放量減幅尤為顯著，主因是於堆填區的都市固體廢物棄置量減少3.4%，以及用於生產能源的堆填氣體回收量增加近12%。

為配合國家在二○三○年前碳排放量達峰，並於二○六○年前實現碳中和的「雙碳」目標，政府會繼續積極落實《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》中「淨零發電」、「節能綠建」、「綠色運輸」和「全民減廢」四個減碳策略，以實現在二○三五年前把香港的碳排放量從二○○五年的水平減半，並在二○五○年前實現碳中和。

二○二四年溫室氣體排放清單已上載至碳中和及可持續發展網頁（cnsd.gov.hk/tc/climate-ready/ghg-emissions-and-trends）。"
Latest figures of primary healthcare services provided by Health Bureau to residents affected by Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire,2026-01-22 10:00,2026-01-22 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012100608.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced earlier the medical support provided for residents affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. At present, the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong serve as hubs to co-ordinate various primary healthcare services as needed for the affected residents. The HHB announced today (January 22) the latest figures of these services:

DHC hotlines

  Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1, 2025, (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services provided by private family doctors and Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary, and making referrals to necessary healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. The services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow-up appointments and medication refill service points, from Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts. As of January 20, the DHCs hotlines across all 18 districts have received 363 enquiries in total.

Free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners and free denture replacement services

  The HHB introduced a free family doctor service scheme, free CM consultation services, and free denture replacement services on December 4, 15, and 23, 2025, respectively to support the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents until February 28 this year. Case managers of the DHCs will arrange for them to receive up to three free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners respectively based on their individual situations and preferences, covering the provision of medication and related treatments; and at least one free dental consultation and one follow-up appointment (subject to clinical need), covering denture replacement and oral treatment services.

  As of January 20, more than 300 private family doctors have participated in the free family doctor service scheme, covering more than 450 service points that include eight private hospitals. So far, 94 referrals have been handled. As for the free CM consultation services, more than 360 CM practitioners have participated, covering more than 620 service points, and 57 referrals have been handled so far. Regarding free denture replacement services, more than 110 private dentists have participated, covering over 150 service points, and 31 referrals have been handled so far.

HA's healthcare services

  All individuals injured in the fire and admitted to public hospitals under the HA will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation. A total of 79 patients received treatment at various public hospitals due to the fire. As of January 20, 71 of them had already recovered and were discharged, and the remaining eight are in stable condition. Healthcare staff will continue to provide appropriate treatment and care to these patients.

  Moreover, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31 this year. The waivers cover in-patient services, family medicine and specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs) services (including psychiatry SOPCs), accident and emergency services, day hospitals, day procedures, community services, and Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres under the HA. As of January 20, the HA has provided necessary healthcare services to around 1 900 affected residents.

Mental health support

  The 18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline immediately deployed additional staff and strengthened training for its call handlers on the day of the fire incident to cope with the emotional distress that the public may experience due to the incident. From the time of the incident to January 20, the hotline has received over 17 000 calls, 750 of which were related to the fire incident. The WhatsApp service has handled over 800 messages, with about 50 of them concerning the fire incident. The HA's 24-hour Mental Health Direct hotline, manned by psychiatric nurses, offers professional advice and support on mental health issues to callers, including provision of risk assessments and referrals to the HA's mental health services as appropriate. As of January 20, the Mental Health Direct hotline has received 102 calls related to the fire incident, with 40 of them coming from affected citizens.

  The HHB will continue to provide comprehensive primary healthcare support to affected residents. The HHB also designed the relevant service workflow from the residents' perspective, allowing them to receive convenient and effective medical support simply through the DHCs (see Annex 2)."

FS promotes Hong Kong's advantages to global leaders in Switzerland (with photos/video),2026-01-22 09:00,2026-01-22 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200132.htm,"​The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, continued his visit to Davos, Switzerland, yesterday (January 21, Davos time) to attend activities of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting. He participated in multiple luncheons and networking sessions, and met with officials and business leaders from various regions to promote Hong Kong's advantages.

At noon, Mr Chan attended the ""2026 Davos-Caixin CEO Luncheon"" themed ""Beyond Old Models: Designing Growth That Works"" and delivered a keynote speech. In his speech, Mr Chan introduced the steady progress Hong Kong has made over the past year or two, and shared the city's development vision and strategic positioning in its three key growth engines — finance, trade as well as innovation and technology.

He highlighted that breakthroughs in technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain are driving profound industrial transformation and economic growth. All economies must embrace these developments. Under the ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is actively exploring and piloting initiatives in financial and technological innovation. With strong collaboration with neighbouring cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area that boast robust innovation and technology industrial chains, Hong Kong holds tremendous development potential and is a worthwhile investment destination.

Mr Chan also pointed out that international trade is undergoing a paradigm shift. Developed countries must be aware that the traditional development model of producing and exporting low-cost goods, previously dominant among developing economies, is evolving. Taking China as an example, the country is advancing high-level, two-way opening-up and driving its economy with a focus on expanding domestic demand. This not only injects momentum into China's high-quality development, but also creates vast market opportunities for quality goods and services from across the globe, fostering shared prosperity.

In the evening, Mr Chan attended a dinner themed ""China in Focus"" and delivered a speech sharing his views on China's development, international relations, as well as capital market developments in both the Mainland and Hong Kong.

Earlier in the day, Mr Chan also attended a business exchange session of the WEF Annual Meeting, where he interacted with nearly 100 leaders from various sectors and regions. The discussion covered topics such as the outlook for the United States and global economies, strategies to enhance economic resilience, and ways to promote growth.

Meanwhile, Mr Chan also held bilateral meetings with the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, Mr Sun Chanthol, and the Minister of State for Financial Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Mr Mohamed bin Hadi Al Hussaini. They exchanged views on the global economic and trade landscape and matters of mutual interest, and explored ways to strengthen bilateral economic and trade co-operation. Mr Chan also met with the Chairlady and Founder of medical technology company Yidu Tech, Ms Gong Yingying, yesterday to learn about the development of its AI and digital-powered clinical platform. He encouraged the company to consider expanding its business to Hong Kong.

Mr Chan will continue his visit in Davos today (January 22, Davos time)."

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-22 06:45,2026-01-22 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012100711.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十二日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

Employers and employees should take precautions during cold weather,2026-01-22 06:45,2026-01-22 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012100701.htm,"Attention duty announcers, radio and TV stations:

Please broadcast the following special announcement immediately, and repeat it at frequent intervals when the Cold Weather Warning is in force:

  The Labour Department reminds employers that as the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions such as reminding employees who have to work outdoors or in remote areas to wear appropriately warm clothing, and make arrangements for employees to rotate from outdoor to indoor or sheltered work sites as far as possible. Employees should take note of the weather report, wear appropriately warm clothing and be mindful of their health conditions. They should notify their supervisors and seek medical help immediately if feeling unwell, such as having cold limbs and body shivering."
CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-22 06:45,2026-01-22 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012100721.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 22) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

立法會：房屋局局長就「推行長者房屋政策」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-01-21 20:31,2026-01-21 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100643.htm,"以下是房屋局局長何永賢今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上就林筱魯議員動議的「推行長者房屋政策」議案的總結發言：

主席：

非常感謝林筱魯議員的議案及李鎮強議員和陳文宜議員修正的議案，還有其他今日很多位議員的發言，多謝你們關心香港長者住屋情況，亦提供了很多的寶貴意見。我會就今日聽到的意見作綜合回應和一些補充。

很多議員提及興建長者公寓、長者社區，為提供長者住宿單位，提供集居住、康樂設施與醫療護理於一身的居所。

事實上，房協（香港房屋協會）在這方面正正做了很多探討，在他們的先導項目中做了很多不同的模式。這些模式不單是樓宇的設計，還有是關乎按揭、財務安排、租務安排等。這些跟房委會（香港房屋委員會）所做的是相輔相成，很有意義，提供更多不同的答案，更多落地可行的做法。無論是帶動私人市場，或是在設計方面都可以有更多的選擇。

未來，我們都會在這方面繼續和房協一起做多些功夫。例如，房協的「長者安居樂」住屋計劃，就是用一個終身租住的模式營運，為年滿60歲的中等收入人士提供居集居住、康樂設施與醫療護理於一身的居所。目前已落成入住的三個「長者安居樂」項目，分別為將軍澳的樂頤居、牛頭角的彩頤居，以及紅磡的豐頤居，合共提供888個長者友善單位。有意見希望未來社會可以加大、更多這些可能性，或在私人市場看到這些模式是實際可行，或可以怎樣優化以配合市場運作，這個我們希望未來房協可以繼續這方面的工作。下一個位於粉嶺百和路的項目亦已經落成，將提供約260個單位。房協在乙明邨亦以新的建築方法，以「組裝合成」建築法興建長者住屋項目，叫「松悅樓」，提供了64個長者友善的單位，給一些出租的全長者寬敞戶申請。一些非資助性的項目，更加接近私人樓宇的模式，就是北角丹拿山的「雋悅」。

房委會和房協，我們怎樣去大家互相探討不同的範疇呢？在房委會方面，我們希望在我們的屋邨多點「居家安老」、「跨代共融」的模式。因為有些長者可能喜歡在比較集中的地方，多點醫療配套的地方安老，但有長者又喜歡在原本住了很久的地方居住，令到老中青幼都可以在社區裏共享一個幸福的設計。所以一些通用設計在未來的屋邨是很重要的，讓不同人士可以一起建立長者和諧的社區關係。

要建立共融社會，整體和長遠來說，劃分一些房屋或社區讓長者居住，很多長者很想用這個型式。但是，另外一些長者則希望在日常生活、出入時仍然可以見到很多小朋友、年輕人，大家閒話家常是很開心的事。所以房協和房委會，大家在不同的範疇裏一起努力，例如，房委會會把一些長者友善的元素融入房屋項目中，凝聚不同年齡的居民。房協亦有一個新想法，就是加入一些「可改動設計」，即是當一戶人一直住、直至年紀大的時候，有些設計可以改動以配合需要，例如煮飯的地方，有些位置可以改動廚櫃，令到他需要坐輪椅的時候，可以方便出入廚房。這些都是很有價值，可以說是設計的實驗。專門為長者建造的住屋項目或其他不同的模式，將居家安老的設計融入更多住宅項目，配合社會老齡化的需要，提升住戶的幸福感，在地做多點不同的設計，這個是我們未來的心意和願望。

我們重申，希望房委會和房協結合起來探討不同的模式。由小設計，到整個大廈的管理，或者是一些租住模式、財務安排，這些都希望可以在私人市場提供更多不同的選擇，亦都可以帶動私人市場的思考。可能他們見到原來這些新的設計都不是那麼貴，自然已經吸納在本身的樓宇裏，或者有些需要政府有更多的誘因帶動的，或者有些變成法例，規定一定要做，這些都是我們未來可以繼續探討的方向。

除了硬件設計，我們都聽到，軟件服務亦很重要，長者亦希望能夠更集中，以「中心為本」，的社區照顧模式。所以在公營房屋的規劃，或者將來北都的房屋規劃，我們會繼續配合不同的政策，提供一些福利設施。我們會繼續諮詢不同的部門、機構、社會福利署的意見，提供合適數量和種類的福利設施，例如長者鄰舍中心、日間護理中心等。

生活的設備是很重要的，舉幾個例子，剛才有議員都有提到，升降機真是能夠便利長者，以前可能一些舊的屋邨，或者香港的地理環境，很多都在一些山坡，高高低低。以往可能都是靠行樓梯，但隨着高齡化的社會來臨，一些依山而建的屋邨我們都開始探討。所以於二○○八年開始我們已經推行了很多加裝升降機計劃，至今已有33個公共屋邨加裝了85部升降機、還有很多自動電梯、行人天橋等，這些做法，希望我們可以在一些比較難加升降機的情況，譬如剛才有議員提到，可能我們要用樓梯機，甚至一些不是固定安裝的樓梯機，是有需要時候去租，靈活給物管使用，這些我們都會探討。這些也帶動了私人市場，希望有更多這些服務公司，給予他們生意的時候，在私人市場裏亦可以服務一些舊樓的業主。

有議員提及一些很細緻的，例如大門的密碼，還要長者拿着很多餸菜按鍵是不方便。這個希望很快大家都會聽到，我們都會試驗一些智能出入門咭。我們希望先選一些先導項目，然後再推廣至不同屋邨。所以大家看到我們無論是整體的規劃設計到很細緻的，我們未來都會不斷努力的。

到內地大灣區養老也是剛才有很多議員提及過的。我們都明白，也留意到近年很多公屋長者會選擇到內地灣區養老，是一個趨勢。移居內地後可能他們有時會擔心會不會有適應問題，為加強支援他們在粵閩兩地養老的一些長者的需要，房委會容許參加社會福利署「可攜社會保障計劃」的長者住戶，保留其原有的公屋單位，是他原本住的公屋單位，我們讓他保留不超過六個月，以往是三個月，現在延長了，給長些時間他嘗試適應。我們亦有一個機制，發出一張俗稱「回頭紙」的保證書，即是說如果將來他已交回公屋單位或刪除公屋戶籍的受助人，在符合一定資格和資源許可的情況下，如果他要回來的時候，拿着這張「回頭紙」可以重新獲編配公屋單位或恢復戶籍。

「逆按揭」亦有相當多議員提及過，在「逆按揭」方面要多推廣，或在現行的「逆按揭」裏有沒有空間再優化樓宇的年齡等。我們在未來日子都會和財經事務及庫務局、金管局（香港金融管理局）等機構多作探討。

其實今日的討論，有很多是關乎私樓的。私樓方面亦有關乎有很多不同的政策局，例如發展局、醫衞局（醫務衞生局）等。在一些醫療衞生配套或社福配套，今日都有很多的建議。我相信在照顧老人家這個範疇，事實上有很多跨政策局的合作。在未來的日子，我會和不同的政策局細心聆聽和消化，吸收大家今日的意見。

主席，我們明白大部分長者希望可以留在自己喜歡和熟悉的環境和社區生活、安老。因此，令我們的社區環境更長者友善，加入更多無障礙的設計，培養正面的跨代關係，更多的「以人為本」、貼心的服務支援，是非常重要的。締造長者友善生活環境這個課題需要全方位、跨政策和跨部門的合作。每一個人都會老，未來我們會與相關部門一起努力，多聽社會的意見，用心為我們的「老友記」服務。

多謝主席。"
立法會：政制及內地事務局局長就「制訂香港特區發展願景，主動對接國家『十五五』規劃」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-21 20:00,2026-01-21 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100557.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上就嚴剛議員動議的「制訂香港特區發展願景，主動對接國家『十五五』規劃」議案的開場發言︰

主席：

中共二十屆四中全會在去年十月二十三日審議通過了《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》（「十五五」規劃建議）。「十五五」規劃建議為國家未來五年發展作出了頂層設計、戰略擘畫，不但總結了「十四五」時期國家發展所取得的重大成就，更明確了「十五五」時期，即二○二六年至二○三○年間，國家經濟社會發展的指導思想、主要目標和重大舉措。「十五五」規劃建議提出「十五五」時期經濟社會發展的主要目標，包括為高質量發展取得顯著成效、科技自立自強水平大幅提高、進一步全面深化改革取得新突破、社會文明程度明顯提升、人民生活品質不斷提高、美麗中國建設取得新的重大進展，以及國家安全屏障更加穩固。在以上基礎上再奮鬥五年，到二○三五年實現我國經濟實力、科技實力、國防實力、綜合國力和國際影響力大幅提升，人均國內生產總值達到中等發達國家水平，人民生活更加幸福美好，基本實現社會主義現代化。

在「一國兩制」下，香港特區享有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢和重要作用，在推進國家強國建設中一直扮演重要角色。從一九九六年的「九五」規劃綱要首次提及港澳，到二○二一年「十四五」規劃綱要中的「港澳專章」，香港在國家規劃中的地位不斷提升。過去幾年，在國家的大力支持、特區政府全力推動、香港各界的不懈努力下，香港已成為首屈一指的國際金融中心、航運中心、貿易中心。香港更是位居全球第三、亞太區第一的國際金融中心。香港在其他國際報告中排名亦屢創新高，包括全球競爭力上升四位至世界第三、人才競爭力兩年共上升12位至世界第四，安全城市排名躋身十大。

「十五五」規劃建議為香港賦予了新的戰略內涵——鞏固提升和建設打造「四中心、一高地」，即國際金融、航運、貿易和創新科技中心，以及國際高端人才集聚高地。正如國家主席習近平一再強調，香港融入和服務國家發展大局是「一國兩制」的應有之義，也是特區未來發展的新路向、新空間、新動能的關鍵所在。我們必須要繼續善用「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，發揮好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要角色，全面推進金融、創科發展雙引擎建設，不斷深化國際交往合作。

現時，特區政府各個政策局及部門正積極就十五五規劃建議的內容作深入研究。待「十五五」規劃綱要於今年三月全國人大通過後，我們會積極主動做好各項具體對接的工作，以促成香港的全面發展，同時助力國家的高質量發展和高水平對外開放，推進國家強國建設、開創民族復興偉業新局面。

接下來，我和我的同事會細心聆聽各位議員的寶貴意見，共同交流如何將主動對接「十五五」規劃的工作做得更紮實、更高效。我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"

Question:

 The Mainland offices and liaison units of the Government (the Mainland offices) have been actively promoting Hong Kong's strengths, promoting exchanges and cooperation between Hong Kong and the Mainland, as well as supporting Hong Kong people and enterprises to integrate into the overall development of the country. There are views that the Mainland offices can further leverage the role as an important bridge for ""going global and attracting external investment"" in promoting Hong Kong to align with the national 15th Five-Year Plan in a more proactive manner. On supporting Hong Kong residents and enterprises pursuing development in the Mainland, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views pointing out that the Mainland offices are serving cities diverse in their characteristics, so that they have their own focus on work priorities, whether the Government has plans to formulate overall targets and establish a cross-office coordination mechanism for the Mainland offices with a view to coordinating resources more effectively as well as defining the overall service and support directions of the Mainland offices; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as the 2025 Policy Address has indicated that the Government will encourage Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong in expanding their businesses overseas, whether the Government has plans to organise Hong Kong enterprises pursuing development in the Mainland to join forces with Mainland enterprises in tapping new markets, so as to make ""Hong Kong Brands"" shine in the Mainland and overseas; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as it is learnt that the Mainland offices currently promote Hong Kong's strengths and support Hong Kong people and enterprises in the Mainland through measures such as disseminating information, organising thematic activities, promoting youth exchange, and maintaining communication and liaison with the Mainland authorities, whether the Government has plans to introduce more proactive and targeted support policies apart from the aforesaid measures; if so, of the details (including the relevant performance indicators); if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) whether the Government has plans to enhance the support for associations of Hong Kong residents and chambers of Hong Kong enterprises in the Mainland, and further strengthen the liaison with associations of Hong Kong residents and chambers of Hong Kong enterprises in the Mainland through the associations of Hong Kong residents in the Mainland sector, such as collecting views regularly, organising thematic exchanges, as well as proactively paying attention to the difficulties of Hong Kong people and enterprises in the Mainland and assisting them in resolving such difficulties; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 After consulting the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the consolidated response to the Hon Maggie Chan's question is as follows:

(1) The major responsibilities of the Mainland Offices of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government (the Mainland Offices) include enhancing liaison and communication between Hong Kong and the Central People's Government as well as the provincial and municipal governments on the Mainland to promote exchange and co-operation; telling Hong Kong's good stories on the Mainland to promote the unique characteristics of Hong Kong as well as the investment opportunities and business advantages under the national development plan and development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, so as to encourage and attract Mainland enterprises and talents to establish presence in Hong Kong; fostering youth and cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland; providing information and other appropriate support and assistance to Hong Kong residents and enterprises on the Mainland, etc.

 As for the above tasks, the Mainland Offices have set annual key performance indicators which would be published in the Policy Address and the Budget. For 2026, the Mainland Offices will organise no less than 3 400 visits to Mainland authorities or bodies, attending no less than 290 speaking occasions, conducting no less than 350 media interviews or briefings, and participating in no less than 880 business and trade meetings.

 The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, as the policy bureau of the HKSAR Government responsible for Mainland affairs, will oversee, coordinate and direct the Mainland Offices to effectively discharge their duties to ensure that they operate efficiently, and execute their work plans and provide a wide range of services in accordance with the targets.

(2) The 2025 Policy Address proposed to establish a one-stop platform by mobilising Hong Kong's overseas offices, including those under InvestHK and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), as well as the Mainland Offices, and set up the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (Task Force) to encourage Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong in expanding their businesses overseas. The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development is overseeing the work of the Task Force and coordinating with various bureaux, departments and agencies in formulating proposals for enterprises looking to go global. The Task Force will also organise various investment promotion activities across mainland provinces and municipalities to promote Hong Kong's unique advantages, and to identify and attract mainland enterprises looking to go global to set up operations in Hong Kong. When they expand their business abroad in future, these enterprises can benefit from the Government's ""Economic and Trade Express"" under which they will be better supported for overseas business missions and business matching activities through enhancement of collaboration among the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices in the overseas, InvestHK and the HKTDC.

(3) In addition to the above-mentioned promotional measures, the Mainland Offices collaborate with other Hong Kong institutions, including the HKTDC and the Hong Kong Tourism Board, etc. to formulate tailored work plans which respond to new opportunities arising from the national development, as well as the characteristics and circumstances of individual province, municipality and autonomous region. The aim is to provide appropriate support and services to Hong Kong people and businesses on the Mainland, helping them better integrate into national development strategy and develop locally. The Mainland Offices will also promote Hong Kong's advantages and tell good stories of Hong Kong. For example, we collaborate with local governments, trade associations and Hong Kong chambers of commerce to organise different types of trade promotion events, cooperation and matching sessions, thematic seminars, study tours, experience-sharing forums and gatherings for Hong Kong businessmen. Hong Kong enterprises on the Mainland and Hong Kong businessmen interested in expanding into the Mainland market will be invited to actively participate in these activities, which will not only broaden their business networks but also provide them with opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of the latest developments, policies, and development opportunities in the region concerned.

(4) The Mainland Offices have all along been striving to establish and maintain close liaison with associations, chambers of commerce, enterprises and student groups of Hong Kong people in their service areas, and proactively understand the situation of Hong Kong people working, studying and living therein and the difficulties they encountered through various economic, trade and cultural exchange activities being held from time to time. The Mainland Offices will provide appropriate support and assistance to Hong Kong people having regard to the actual situation and need, and reflect their demands to the relevant Mainland authorities. To assist Hong Kong people to better adapt to local life, the Mainland Offices have also compiled booklets of practical information on everyday life, with electronic version published on their websites and social media platforms, and provide Hong Kong residents on the Mainland with information on the latest Mainland laws and regulations, policies, major regional developments, etc. In addition, through the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development Promotion Centre located in Guangzhou, the Mainland Offices promote Greater Bay Area opportunities to Hong Kong residents and businesses developing in the Greater Bay Area cities on the Mainland and provide various practical assistance.

 Furthermore, the HKTDC visits Hong Kong enterprises on the Mainland from time to time to understand their business development needs and operational challenges, and organises relevant thematic events to provide them with trade and business support. The HKTDC has also launched the ""GoGBA one-stop platform"" and the ""GoGBA"" digital information platform to provide the business community with the latest information on the ""9+2"" city cluster of the Greater Bay Area, including policies, markets, industries, funding opportunities, and the latest developments in individual Bay Area city. A network of ""GoGBA Business Support Centres"" has also been established across all Greater Bay Area cities. In particular, the ""GoGBA Business Support Centre"" located in the concourse of Shenzhen Futian High-Speed Rail Station is jointly set up by the HKTDC, the People's Government of Futian District, Shenzhen and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in Guangdong."

主席：

就陳曼琪議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局後，現綜合回應如下：

（一）香港特區政府駐內地辦事處（駐內地辦事處）的主要職能，包括促進香港與中央政府、內地各省、市、自治區政府的聯繫和溝通，推動交流合作；在內地說好香港故事，推廣香港特色，以及香港在國家整體發展規劃和粵港澳大灣區建設下的投資機遇及營商優勢，鼓勵和吸引內地企業和人才落戶香港；促進香港與內地的青年及文化交流；為在內地的港人港商提供資訊及其他適當支援和協助等。

因應上述工作，駐內地辦事處已訂立年度的關鍵績效指標，並於年度《施政報告》及《財政預算案》中公布。就二○二六年而言，駐內地辦事處會造訪內地機關或組織不少於3 400次、出席活動發表演說不少於290次、接受傳媒訪問或舉行簡報會不少於350次、以及參加商貿會議不少於880次。

政制及內地事務局作為特區政府負責內地事務的政策局，會統籌、協調及指導各駐內地辦事處有效執行各相關工作，確保辦事處有效運作，並按目標推行各項工作計劃和提供各式服務。

（二）二○二五年《施政報告》提出整合香港的外地辦事處，包括投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局（貿發局）和駐內地辦事處，組成一站式平台，成立「內地企業出海專班」（專班），主動招攬在內地的企業善用香港平台「出海」。商務及經濟發展局局長正督導專班工作及協調各政策局、部門和機構，為「出海」企業制訂多元方案。專班亦會在內地各省市舉辦不同類型的投資推廣活動，宣傳香港的獨特優勢，物色並吸引有需要「出海」的內地企業落戶香港。這些落戶香港的內地企業日後到海外發展業務時，可受惠於特區政府設立的「經貿一站通」平台，即透過海外經濟貿易辦事處、投資推廣署及貿發局加強協作以支援它們進行海外商務考察及配對工作。

（三）除題述的各項推廣措施外，各駐內地辦事處亦會夥拍其他香港機構包括貿發局、旅遊發展局等，因應國家整體發展策略所帶來的新機遇，以及各省、市、自治區本身的特點及情況，因地制宜地制訂合適的工作計劃，為在內地的港人、港商提供適切的支援和服務，支持他們更好融入國家發展大局和在當地發展，以及在當地推廣香港的優勢，說好香港故事。例如，我們會與當地政府部門、商貿協會和香港商會合作，共同舉辦各式商貿推廣活動、合作對接會、主題研討會、考察團、經驗交流會、港商聚會等，並邀請內地港企和有意開拓內地市場的港商積極參與。有關活動不但可以擴闊商網，還可進一步了解當地的最新發展情況和各項政策措施以及發展機遇。

（四）各駐內地辦事處一直致力與駐地的港人組織、商會、企業和學生團體等建立和保持緊密聯繫，並通過不時舉辦的各類經貿文化交流活動主動了解港人在當地工作、學習和生活的情況以及所遇到的困難。駐內地辦事處會按實際情況和需要為港人提供適切的支援和協助，並就他們的訴求向內地相關部門作出反映。為協助港人更好地適應當地生活，駐內地辦事處又已編製實用生活資訊小冊子，同時以電子版本在辦事處網站及社交媒體上發布，並向內地港人提供有關內地最新法律法規、政策及重大區域發展等的資訊。另外，駐內地辦事處又透過設於廣州的粵港澳大灣區發展推廣中心，向在大灣區內地城市發展的香港居民和企業推廣大灣區機遇，並提供各種實務性的協助。

此外，貿發局亦不時拜訪內地港企，了解其業務發展需要及營運挑戰，並舉辦合適的主題活動，提供商貿支援。同時，貿發局又推出了「GoGBA一站式平台」和「GoGBA灣區經貿通」數碼資訊平台，為商界提供大灣區「9+2」城市群的最新資訊，包括政策、市場、產業、資助，以至各灣區城市的最新發展，並在各灣區城市建立了「GoGBA港商服務站」網絡，其中位於深圳福田高鐵站大堂的「GoGBA港商服務站」更是由貿發局、深圳市福田區人民政府和廣東省香港商會共同建立。"

（三）政府除了每年透過《施政報告》制訂一年期的政策規劃外，會否主動對接國家的規劃部署，長遠制訂「五年規劃」，以配合國家的宏觀發展方向？

答覆：

主席：

就吳傑莊議員的提問，經諮詢創新科技及工業局及發展局後，現回覆如下：

（一）中共二十屆四中全會在去年十月審議通過了《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》（「十五五」規劃建議）。「十五五」規劃建議為國家未來五年發展作出頂層設計、戰略擘畫，全面部署了「十五五」時期的戰略任務和重大舉措，明確從產業發展、科技創新、國內市場、經濟體制、對外開放、鄉村振興、區域發展，到文化建設、民生保障、綠色發展、安全發展、國防建設等重點領域的思路和重點工作。這些戰略任務和重大舉措，在在都為香港的未來發展帶來了無限機遇，因此我們全港各界都必須要好好把握。舉例來說，在優化區域經濟布局方面，香港要深度參與粵港澳大灣區建設，更要與內地其他區域經濟加強聯動合作，互利共贏，相互促進；在國際合作方面，香港要繼續深化國際交往合作，吸引全球高端人才與資本，發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台作用；在綠色發展方面，要推進綠色金融與碳中和實踐，助力國家生態文明建設，同時促進本港環保產業發展。至於議員關注的創新科技發展方面，政府已於二○二二年公布《香港創新科技發展藍圖》。另外，河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區）亦已在二○二五年十二月正式開幕。港深兩地會爭取試行專屬的跨境政策措施，讓人員、物資、資金、數據等重要創新要素在河套區內便捷流動，致力成為國際先進科技創新規劃試驗區，開闢制度與政策創新的試驗田，以響應在「十五五」規劃建議中對高質量發展和科技自強自立的目標要求。由此可見，對接「十五五」規劃的工作是全方位、深層次和多領域的，可說是無遠弗屆。而「十五五」規劃建議亦為香港的發展作出了重要部署，提出鞏固提升和建設打造「四中心、一高地」，即國際金融、航運、貿易和創新科技中心，以及國際高端人才集聚高地。這些部署既是香港未來長遠發展的方向和動能所在，同時亦切合國家的發展定位和有利國家的發展需要。正是以香港所長，服務國家所需。目前，特區政府各政策局及部門正積極深入研究如何在各自領域和範疇就「十五五」規劃建議作出主動對接。稍後待「十五五」規劃綱要草案在全國人大會議通過後，各政策局會全面推進相關對接工作。而行政長官領導的「融入國家發展大局督導組」亦會高層次、全方位地作出指導協調監督，以有效落實相關工作，務使特區全面對接「十五五」規劃，促成國家與香港共同的高質量發展。

（二）至於北部都會區（北都）的發展方面，北都是特區政府積極對接「十五五」規劃的重要舉措，更是引領香港未來經濟和社會發展的重要引擎，有助促進粵港澳大灣區的高質量發展。我們正全力推展北都，加快建設和引進產業。同時，如上所述，河套香港園區已於二○二五年十二月正式開園，創新科技及工業局亦已公布《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》，為新田科技城訂下清晰的發展方略。

發展局近日除了就北都首個「片區開發」項目展開招標外，亦正積極籌備「洪水橋產業園有限公司」於今年年中開始運作。發展局會於首季展開北都提速專屬法例的公開諮詢，近日亦已向業界及持份者介紹加快北都私人項目審批的行政措施。特區政府會繼續通過「對接北部都會區發展策略專班」，與深圳方面就北都的發展作緊密溝通，雙方共同磋商跨境發展建設的相關事宜。

（三）特區政府極為重視主動對接國家「五年規劃」的工作。行政長官每年發表《施政報告》，向立法會及社會各界闡述政府未來一年推出的重大政策方向及具體舉措，當中的政策舉措是有其連貫性的，並高度對接國家的「五年規劃」。事實上，自「十四五」規劃頒布以來，每年的《施政報告》均有就如何鞏固提升香港「八大中心」的地位提出相關的政策措施。政府又不時就重要政策範疇制訂發展藍圖，體現中長遠的發展規劃，例如《香港創新科技發展藍圖》和《中醫藥發展藍圖》等。這些在在都顯示特區政府非常重視特區的長遠規劃發展，而政府設立「融入國家發展大局督導組」以督導「十四五」以至「十五五」規劃，本身就是全面對接國家「五年規劃」的成熟既定機制。

「十五五」規劃將為香港帶來無限的發展機遇，特區政府必定會帶領全港各界共同努力全面主動對接好「十五五」規劃，以促進國家與香港長遠的高質量發展，既融入同時又服務國家的發展大局，並為國家的強國建設和民族的偉大復興作出貢獻。

多謝主席。"
LCQ6: Alignment with country's development plans,2026-01-21 19:44,2026-01-21 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100561.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Johnny Ng and a reply by the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

  The Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan outline the country's development in the next five years and make special arrangements to promote long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific policy options to proactively align with the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan, including how to broaden economic development and growth, accelerate the development and application of innovation and technology, and expedite the upgrading of industry structures, so as to align with the country's development;

(2) as there are views that the Northern Metropolis will be crucial to Hong Kong's economic and innovation development during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, how the Government will strengthen co-operation between the Northern Metropolis and other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, such as formulating joint policies to promote division of work in development, streamlining the administration workflows, advancing infrastructure construction, and expediting the implementation of the Northern Metropolis Action Agenda and the Conceptual Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San Tin Technopole, so as to align with the country's planning and development; and

(3) whether the Government will, apart from formulating one-year policy planning through the annual Policy Address, proactively align with the country's planning and arrangements and formulate ""five-year plans"" in the long run, so as to align with the country's macro development direction?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB) and the Development Bureau (DEVB), our reply in response to the questions raised by Dr the Hon Johnny Ng is as follows:

(1) The Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) deliberated and adopted the Recommendations of the CPC Central Committee for Formulating the 15th Five Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development (the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan) in October last year. The Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan provide top-level design and strategic blueprint for the country’s development over the next five years, comprehensively devising the strategic tasks and major initiatives during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, and clarifying the approaches and key tasks in priority areas ranging from industrial development, technological innovation, domestic market, economic system, opening-up, rural revitalisation, and regional development, to cultural construction, safeguarding people's livelihoods, green development, safe development, and national defence. All of these strategic tasks and major initiatives will bring boundless opportunities for Hong Kong's future development, and therefore all sectors of Hong Kong society must seize them firmly. For example, in terms of improving regional economic structures, Hong Kong should deeply engage in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, while strengthening interactive co-operation with other Mainland regional economies for mutual benefit, win-win results, and mutual advancement. In terms of international co-operation, Hong Kong should continue to deepen international exchanges and co-operation, attract global high-end talents and capital, and play its dual roles of assisting Mainland enterprises to ""go global"" and attracting overseas investment. In terms of green development, Hong Kong should promote green finance and carbon neutrality practices to support the country's ecological civilisation construction, while fostering the development of local environmental industries. As for the innovation and technology development that Member is concerned about, the Government announced the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint in 2022. In addition, the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone (the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park) officially opened in December 2025. Hong Kong and Shenzhen will strive for trial implementation of dedicated cross-boundary policy measures to facilitate the convenient flow of important innovation elements including personnel, materials, capital and data within the Loop, endeavouring to become a testing zone for new rules and innovation and cultivate a testing ground for institutional and policy innovation, in response to the goals and requirements for high-quality development as well as self-reliance and strength in science and technology in the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan. From the above, it can be seen that the work of aligning with the 15th Five-Year Plan is all-round, in-depth and multi-dimensional, covering extensive areas. The Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan also make important plans for Hong Kong's development, proposing to consolidate, enhance, build and develop the ""Four Centres and One Highland"", namely the international financial, shipping, trade and innovation and technology centres, as well as the highland of international top-tier talent. These plans not only represent the direction and driving force for Hong Kong's long-term development in the future, but also align with the country's development positioning and are conducive to the country's development needs, precisely leveraging Hong Kong's strengths to serve the country's needs. At present, policy bureaux and departments of the HKSAR Government are actively studying in-depth on how to proactively align with the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan in their respective scopes and purviews. After the draft outline of the 15th Five-Year Plan is adopted at the session of the National People's Congress later, the policy bureaux will take forward the relevant alignment work in full swing. The Steering Group on Integration into National Development led by the Chief Executive will also provide high-level, all-round guidance, co-ordination and supervision to effectively implement the relevant work, ensuring that the HKSAR fully aligns with the 15th Five-Year Plan and promotes high-quality development for both the country and Hong Kong.

(2) As regard the development of the Northern Metropolis (NM), it is an important measure taken by the HKSAR Government to actively align with the 15th Five-Year Plan, as well as an important engine driving Hong Kong's future economic and social development. It helps promote the high-quality development and foster more comprehensive co-operation of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We are moving full steam ahead to develop the NM, expedite the construction and attract industries. At the same time, as mentioned above, the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park already officially opened in December 2025, and the ITIB has also promulgated the Conceptual Outline of Development Plan for Innovation and Technology Industry in San Tin Technopole, setting a clear development strategy for the San Tin Technopole.

  Recently, in addition to launching the tender exercise for the first pilot area under the large-scale land disposal approach within the NM, DEVB is also actively preparing for the Hung Shui Kiu Industry Park Company Limited's commencement of operation in mid-2026. DEVB will conduct a public consultation on the dedicated legislation to accelerate the development of the NM in the first quarter, and has recently introduced to the industry and stakeholders the administrative measures to expedite approval of private projects within the NM. The HKSAR Government will continue to maintain close liaison with the Shenzhen side on matters relating to NM development through the Task Force for Collaboration on the NM Development Strategy. Both sides will conduct joint discussions on matters related to cross-boundary development and construction.

(3) The HKSAR Government attaches utmost importance to the work of proactively aligning with the country's ""Five-Year Plans"". The Chief Executive delivers the Policy Address annually, setting out to the Legislative Council and all sectors of the community the major policy directions and concrete measures to be launched by the Government in the coming year. These policy measures maintain consistency and are highly aligned with the national ""Five-Year Plans"". In fact, since the promulgation of the 14th Five-Year Plan, each year's Policy Address has included specific policy initiatives aimed at consolidating and strengthening Hong Kong's role as the ""eight centres"" outlined in the plan. The Government also formulates development blueprints from time to time for key policy areas, manifesting medium- to long-term development planning, such as the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint and the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint. All these demonstrate that the HKSAR Government attaches great importance to the long-term planning and development of the HKSAR. The establishment by the Government of the Steering Group on Integration into National Development to steer the 14th Five-Year Plan and the 15th Five-Year Plan is in itself a mature and established mechanism for comprehensively aligning with the country's ""Five-Year Plans"".

  The 15th Five-Year Plan will bring boundless development opportunities to Hong Kong. The HKSAR Government will certainly lead all sectors of Hong Kong society to work together to fully and proactively align with the 15th Five-Year Plan, so as to promote the long-term high-quality development of the country and Hong Kong, integrate into and at the same time serve the overall national development, and contribute to the country's building of a great country and the great rejuvenation of the nation.

  Thank you, President."

衞生署亦已將事件通報內地相關單位。

根據《預防及控制疾病規例》（第599A章），任何人輸入該人有理由懷疑含有傳染性病原體的任何排泄物、分泌物、血液或血液成分，必須提供衞生署的書面准許。違例者一經定罪，最高可被罰款五千元及監禁兩個月。

調查期間，衞生署發現兩間涉事的化驗所（「創新基因診斷實驗室有限公司」及「Zentrogene Bioscience Laboratory Limited」），在網上廣告中聲稱是「屬於香港衞生署認可的醫學化驗機構」，涉嫌誤導消費者。事實上，衞生署並無認可任何醫學化驗機構。此外，根據本署紀錄，另外兩間名為「香港諾華醫療」和「香港鉑雅醫療中心」的涉事機構並未根據《私營醫療機構條例》（第633章）提交診所牌照或小型執業診所豁免書申請，亦未根據《診療所條例》（第343章）註冊，其中「香港鉑雅醫療中心」自稱為「香港註冊醫療診所」。本署已就相關個案通報香港海關跟進，並已要求負責人移除所有誤導性陳述。

DH follows up on suspected illegal importation of blood samples for testing in Hong Kong,2026-01-21 19:00,2026-01-21 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100415.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) has recently received media enquiries concerning individuals who promote services on social media platforms that involve arranging blood draws for pregnant women on the Chinese Mainland and smuggling blood samples into Hong Kong for fetal gender testing. The DH today (January 21) stated that it has immediately followed up on the matter and referred relevant information regarding the two laboratories in question to the Medical Laboratory Technologists Board for appropriate actions against the registered Medical Laboratory Technologists concerned, in accordance with the Allied Health Professions Ordinance (Cap. 359). Under the Ordinance, no registered Medical Laboratory Technologist may perform tests for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment without a referral from a registered medical practitioner or other specified healthcare professional.

The DH has also notified the relevant Mainland authorities.

According to the Prevention and Control of Disease Regulation (Cap. 599A), any person who imports any excreta, secretion, blood or blood component that the person has reason to suspect contains an infectious agent should obtain prior written permission from the DH. The maximum penalty upon convictionis a fine of $5,000 and two months' imprisonment.

  Investigation by the DH revealed that the two laboratories involved - NovaGene Diagnostic Laboratory Limited and Zentrogene Bioscience Laboratory Limited - falsely claimed in online postings to be ""medical laboratories accredited by the DH"". This information is false and misleading, as the DH does not accredit any medical laboratories. Furthermore, DH records show that two other institutions, named ""Nova Medical"" and ""Hong Kong BOYA Medical Center"", have neither applied for clinic licences or letters of exemption for small practice clinics under the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance (Cap. 633), nor registered under the Medical Clinics Ordinance (Cap. 343). Despite this, ""Hong Kong BOYA Medical Center"" claimed to be a ""Hong Kong registered medical clinic"". The DH has referred these cases to the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department for follow-up and requested the removal of all misleading statements.

In addition, during the investigation, the DH found that advertisements for other services published on the websites of the relevant medical centres involved are suspected of breaching the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap. 231). The DH has issued warnings to the medical centres and ordered the immediate removal of the non-compliant advertisements.

The DH will continue to follow up on the matter seriously and take enforcement actions in accordance with the relevant regulations, in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, to safeguard public health."

政府一直積極拓展包括中東地區在內的經貿網絡，以促進香港的長遠經濟發展。其中，政府已在二○二一年十月設立香港駐迪拜經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦），並正積極與沙特阿拉伯政府跟進在利雅得開設經貿辦的計劃，以加強香港與區內貿易夥伴的經貿關係。此外，投資推廣署於二○二四年七月在埃及開羅，以及在二○二五年一月在土耳其第三大城市伊茲密爾共開設兩間顧問辦事處，致力開拓中東新興市場。

另一方面，政府會繼續積極尋求與包括中東在內的經濟體締結自由貿易協定及投資協定。我們即將與卡塔爾簽訂促進和保護投資協定，以及正分別與沙特阿拉伯和埃及探討簽訂新投資協定。

就陳勇議員的提問，經諮詢教育局、財經事務及庫務局、創新科技及工業局、政府統計處後，現回覆如下：

（一）中東地區發展迅速、充滿潛力，是「一帶一路」倡議的其中一個重要節點。

近年，多個中東國家提出發展願景藍圖，以期在能源產業以外實現經濟多元化轉型，並積極推動產業發展，包括創新科技（創科）、金融、貿易、再生能源和智慧城市，而香港在當中不少領域具備優勢，可與相關中東國家的發展戰略對接、優勢互補，為香港創科、金融、以及其他專業服務公司和初創公司帶來大量商機。

因應中東地區正提速發展，不少龐大的基建項目正全速推進，需要更多元化資金來源及創新籌融資模式。香港同時匯聚海外和內地資本，提供豐富多元和創新的金融工具，加上優秀和經驗豐富的專業服務團隊，可助力中東的提速發展，並為自身開拓更大的發展空間。此外，中東地區正積極尋求分散風險，配合全球經濟重心東移的大趨勢。香港市場國際化同時與內地市場高效互聯，運作方式及規管環境與國際最佳標準無縫銜接，是他們實現多元資產配置及財資管理的理想平台。

有鑑於此，政府一直積極拓展中東市場及建立聯繫，讓來自世界各地的投資者和市場參與者更好了解和善用香港作為國際金融中心的優勢，並為他們提供多元化的金融產品和服務。

香港金融管理局（金管局）過去數年積極向中東國家推廣香港金融體系和市場優勢，以進一步加強與中東市場的合作。例如，金管局與阿拉伯聯合酋長國（阿聯酋）、沙特阿拉伯和卡塔爾等地的中央銀行舉行雙邊會議，並簽署諒解備忘錄，涵蓋金融基建發展、可持續金融、金融科技、市場互聯互通和伊斯蘭金融等範疇。其中，金管局與沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金簽署諒解備忘錄，並共同出資支持創設一項目標規模達10億美元的新投資基金，促進與香港和粵港澳大灣區有聯繫的企業在沙特阿拉伯當地發展。另外，金管局亦正推動銀行業（尤其是內地銀行）在港設立區域總部，利用香港優勢，輻射開拓東南亞和中東等地區市場，提供更全面的跨境金融方案。

我們亦積極透過不同渠道開拓海外資金，包括深化香港與中東地區資金的雙向流動。繼二○二三年亞洲首隻追蹤沙特阿拉伯市場的交易所買賣基金（ETF）在香港掛牌上市，兩隻追蹤香港股票指數的ETF於二○二四年在沙特交易所以聯接基金方式上市，有助吸納當地資金配置港股。此外，香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）已先後與沙特證交所集團和阿布扎比證券交易所簽訂了合作備忘錄，並將沙特交易所、阿布扎比證券交易所及杜拜金融市場納入認可交易所範圍，便利在該些市場上市的企業在香港第二上市。港交所亦在二○二五年於利雅得開設辦事處，進一步促進與中東地區的聯繫。

基於中東國家的潛力，香港一直致力發揮「一帶一路」功能平台的角色，加大力度深化與中東地區的合作。近年，兩地之間的官方交流及經貿活動不斷增加，香港的不同機構與中東地區「一帶一路」國家的相關單位簽訂多份合作備忘錄及協議。其中，行政長官分別於二○二三年二月率領代表團訪問沙特阿拉伯和阿聯酋，以及於二○二五年五月率團訪問卡塔爾和科威特，兩次外訪共促成72份合作備忘錄、協議及聲明，為香港與當地開創商貿、金融、創科、可持續發展、運輸與物流、農業和教育等領域的合作商機。這些備忘錄及協議有助促進香港與中東地區全方位多領域的合作共贏，為長遠合作締造更穩固根基，從而強化雙邊經貿關係，為香港經濟注入新動力。有關合作備忘錄及協議的例子包括：

（a）香港已與巴林、約旦、科威特、沙特阿拉伯、阿聯酋和卡塔爾簽訂全面性避免雙重課稅協定，讓投資者更有效評估其跨境經濟活動的潛在稅務負擔及避免雙重課稅，從而締造更有利的營商環境，促進雙邊貿易和投資；

（b）與科威特、阿聯酋及巴林簽訂促進和保護投資協定，以進一步加強相互投資保護、增強投資者信心和擴大雙邊投資流動；

（c）與巴林、沙特阿拉伯、阿聯酋及卡塔爾簽訂關於各自「認可經濟營運商計劃」的互認安排，加強兩地國際貨物安全，促進合法跨境貨物流通，以加強雙方企業在國際市場的競爭力；以及

（d）與沙特阿拉伯簽署有關基礎建設及建築的合作諒解備忘錄，加強在相關領域的資訊交流，為香港相關專業服務進入當地市場提供支持。

在二○二一年至二○二三年（註三）間，香港對中東的金融服務出口額佔香港金融服務出口總額的比例不足0.5%。政府統計處沒有備存香港對中東的科技產品出口額佔比的統計數字。

（二）作為二○二五年《施政報告》的措施，商務及經濟發展局已設立「經貿一站通」，讓海外經貿辦、投資推廣署及香港貿易發展局按所涵蓋的地區透過建立一站式平台加強協作，發揮互補優勢，三位一體地於外地推廣香港的經貿及投資工作。「經貿一站通」會聚焦支援中小企及初創企業，主動組織相關企業等進行海外商務考察，並提供一站式的支援服務（包括安排商貿配對和其他活動），協助港商於具潛力的海外市場包括中東尋找商機。在過程中，投資推廣署會物色當地企業來港與本地業界對接，促成更多企業在港投資及開設業務，從而帶動企業和投資雙向流動。

此外，「經貿一站通」亦會進行更多推廣香港經貿及投資相關的活動及工作，透過集合三者資源，提升活動的規模和效益。

（三）行政長官在二○二三年《施政報告》提出建設香港成為「國際教育樞紐，未來人才搖籃」，並在二○二四年《施政報告》強調要致力打造「留學香港」品牌。在二○二五年《施政報告》，行政長官進一步提出為向世界推廣香港專上教育，吸引優秀學生學者來港發展，成立由教育局局長擔任主席的「留學香港專班」，與大學教育資助委員會（教資會）、創新科技及工業局、香港人才服務辦公室、專上院校、海外經濟貿易辦事處、駐內地辦事處等加強聯動，加大推廣香港專上教育。

為支持大學加強推廣「留學香港」品牌的工作，促進香港成為國際專上教育樞紐，教資會在二○二五至二○二八三年期撥款約4,000萬元予八所教資會資助大學共同參與的大學校長會國際化小組，以參與和舉辦各項海外活動，並到訪不同地方（尤其中東地區）招收海外學生。各大學均已積極拓展在內地及海外的招生活動，參與個別地區的教育博覽，善用既有的海外網絡聯繫當地的商會和企業，並為有意來港就讀的家長及學生舉行座談會等。教育局通過上述活動加強宣傳包括「一帶一路獎學金」在內的各項政策措施，以期吸引更多學生來港就學。由二○二四／二五學年起，「一帶一路獎學金」每學年的名額亦已增加至150個。在二○二四／二五學年，教資會資助大學舉辦近200次海外招生活動，不少均以「一帶一路」國家為目標，包括阿聯酋、約旦及卡塔爾。

在吸引非本地（包括中東地區）學生方面，由二○二四／二五學年起，政府資助的專上院校非本地學生限額（適用於授課課程）已由相當於本地學生學額的20%提升一倍至40%。各資助大學積極善用放寬後的限額，招收更多非本地學生來港升學。在二○二四／二五學年，學生來自超過100個國家及地區，當中約100人來自中東地區。由二○二六／二七學年起，每所資助專上院校的非本地生自費就學人數上限，由相當於本地學額數目的40%增至50%；資助研究院研究課程的超額收生自資學額上限，亦由100%增至120%。

在與中東地區的專上院校簽訂交流協議方面，教資會一直鼓勵大學提供更多境外交流的學習機會，讓學生更了解國家發展大局及世界大勢。截至二○二四年十一月底，教資會資助大學與全球各地院校一共簽訂了超過2 600份學生交流協議，其中47份涉及中東地區。

在研究合作方面，教資會與研究資助局一直積極推動香港高等教育院校與海外機構加強國際科研協作，深化國際交流並進行更多具影響力的前沿研究，以進一步提升院校的研究基礎實力。截至二○二四年十一月底，教資會資助大學與中東地區院校／機構正在進行的研究合作項目超過50個，包括以色列、阿聯酋、土耳其、沙特阿拉伯等。

此外，在二○二二年底公布的《香港創新科技發展藍圖》提出的四大發展方向包括「積極融入國家發展大局，做好連通內地與世界的橋樑」。香港的三大創科園區（即香港科學園、數碼港及港深創新及科技園）一直積極與世界各地建立合作夥伴關係。上述園區公司分別在二○二三、二○二四和二○二五年與中東地區的創科機構（例如科研機構、創投基金及科技孵化器）簽訂兩份、四份和兩份合作協議／備忘錄，以促進交流合作，協助兩地創科企業於對方地區落戶。

展望未來，三大創科園區將繼續拓展在新興市場（包括中東地區）的創科合作網絡，率領創科企業參加當地論壇及峰會，展示香港創科實力，發揮香港作為連通內地與世界的橋樑角色及優勢。

LCQ7: Promoting exchanges and co-operation with countries in the Middle East region,2026-01-21 18:50,2026-01-21 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100524.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yung and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

 It has been reported that the Government is actively taking the lead in promoting exchanges and co-operation with countries in the Middle East region, including preparations for establishing an Economic and Trade Office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In terms of financial services, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited also established an overseas office in Riyadh last year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in recent years, Hong Kong has signed a number of Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with countries along the Belt and Road in the Middle East region, whether the Government has studied what structural changes the signing of these MOUs have brought to the bilateral trade relations between Hong Kong and these countries; whether it has assessed (i) how such changes affect the long-term co-operation potential between Hong Kong and these countries in industries that enjoy advantages, such as financial services and technology products, and (ii) the specific benefits such changes bring to Hong Kong's economic development; the year-on-year growth rates of bilateral trade between Hong Kong and countries in the Middle East region, as well as their import and export values over the past three years, and the respective proportions of such exports involving Hong Kong's financial services and technology products;

(2) whether consideration will be given to consolidating the layout and resources of Hong Kong overseas offices, such as co-locating the base of such organisations as Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council in the same office building or area in countries in the Middle East region, so that Hong Kong enterprises can benefit from the one-stop services coordinated across different departments/institutions when they explore these markets; and

(3) how the Government promotes co-operation between Hong Kong and institutions and scientific research institutes in countries in the Middle East region, and of the progress and achievements made throughout the co-operation between Hong Kong and institutions and scientific research institutes in these countries so far; over the past three years, (i) the number of exchange programmes organised by Hong Kong and the institutions in these countries, as well as the number of schools and students involved, and (ii) the number of co-operation agreements signed between Hong Kong and the scientific research institutes in these countries; what plans the Government will put in place this year to promote co-operation between Hong Kong and the higher education institutions and scientific research institutes in countries in the Middle East region, and the targets it expects to achieve?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been proactively expanding its economic and trade network, including that in the Middle East region, to promote the long-term economic development of Hong Kong.Among others, the Government established the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in Dubai in October 2021, and is actively liaising with the Government of Saudi Arabia to pursue the establishment of another ETO in Riyadh with a view to strengthening Hong Kong's economic and trade relations with trading partners in the region.Moreover, Invest Hong Kong has established two new consultant offices in Cairo, Egypt in July 2024 and in Izmir, the third largest city in Türkiye in January 2025, thereby exploring the emerging market of the Middle East.

 In addition, the Government will continue to explore free trade agreements and investment promotion and protection agreements (IPPAs) with other economies including those in the Middle East. We will soon be signing an IPPA with Qatar and are exploring new ones with Saudi Arabia and Egypt respectively.

 In response to the Hon Chan Yung's question, after consulting the Education Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Innovation, Technology andIndustryBureau and the Census and Statistics Department, our reply is as follows:

(1) The Middle East region is rapidly developing and full of potential, making it one of the key links of the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI).

 In recent years, numerous Middle East countries have put forward their visionary development blueprints, with a view to driving economic diversification on top of the energy sector, and are actively advancing development in areas like innovation and technology (I&T), finance, trade, renewable energy and smart city. Hong Kong has competitive edge in many of these areas, and may align with the development strategies of relevant Middle East countries, achieve complementarity of strengths, and create tremendous opportunities for Hong Kong's I&T, financial services and other professional services sectors as well as the start-ups.

 Given that the Middle East region is accelerating its development, many of the key infrastructure projects are progressing at full speed, which calls for the need of more diversified funding sources and innovative financing models. With capitals coverage of both international and the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong offers diverse and innovative financial instruments, coupled with a pool of quality and experienced professional services, Hong Kong is also well positioned to assist in the acceleration of the Middle East's development while expanding the room for development for ourselves. Furthermore, the Middle East region is actively seeking to diversify risk, aligning with the global economic shift towards the East. Being internationalised and highly connected with the Chinese Mainland market, Hong Kong has market operations and regulatory standards that are seamlessly aligned with the best international practices. This has made us an ideal platform for diversified asset allocation and wealth management.

 In light of the above, the Government has been actively expanding the Middle East market and establishing connections to enable investors and market participants from around the world to better understand and leverage Hong Kong's strengths as an international financial centre, while providing them with a diverse range of financial products and services.

 Over the past few years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been actively promoting Hong Kong's financial system and market advantages to the Middle East countries to further strengthen co-operation with the Middle East market. For example, the HKMA has held bilateral meetings with central banks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc, and signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) covering areas such as financial infrastructure development, sustainable finance, fintech, market connectivity, Islamic finance, etc. Among these, the HKMA signed an MOU with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, anchoring a joint fund with target size of US$1 billion, to support the localisation of companies in Saudi Arabia connected to Hong Kong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Besides, the HKMA has been encouraging the banking sector, especially banks on the Chinese Mainland, to establish regional headquarters in Hong Kong, where Hong Kong's strengths can help companies expand into markets such as Southeast Asia and the Middle East, thereby providing more comprehensive cross-boundary financial solutions.

 We also actively explore attracting overseas capital through various channels, including deepening the two-way flow of capital between Hong Kong and the Middle East region. Following the listing of Asia's first exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the Saudi Arabia market in Hong Kong in 2023, two ETFs tracking Hong Kong stock indices were listed on the Saudi Exchange in the form of feeder funds in 2024, which helps attract allocation of local capital to Hong Kong stocks. In addition, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has successively signed MOUs with the Saudi Tadawul Group Holding Company and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, and incorporated the Saudi Exchange, the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and the Dubai Financial Market on its list of recognised exchanges to facilitate companies listed on these markets to secondary list in Hong Kong. The HKEX also opened an office in Riyadh in 2025 to further promote ties with the Middle East region.

 As the countries in Middle East is full of potential, Hong Kong is committed to giving full play of our role as the functional platform for the B&RI, and stepping up efforts to deepen co-operation with the Middle East region. In recent years, official exchanges, economic and trade activities between the two sides have been increasing, and various institutions in Hong Kong have signed a number of MOUs and agreements with relevant entities in the Belt and Road countries in the Middle East region. Notably, the Chief Executive (CE) led delegations to visit Saudi Arabia and the UAE in February 2023, and Qatar and Kuwait in May 2025 respectively. These visits resulted in a total of 72 MOUs, agreements and statements, creating co-operation and business opportunities for Hong Kong and the Middle East in areas including trade, finance, I&T, sustainable development, transport and logistics, agriculture and education, etc. The above MOUs and agreements are conducive in driving all-round, multi-field collaboration and bring mutual benefits to Hong Kong and the Middle East region, thereby laying a solid foundation for long-term co-operation, thus consolidating the bilateral commercial and economic relations, injecting new energy to Hong Kong's economy. The relevant examples of MOUs and agreements include:

(a) Hong Kong has signed Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements with Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, enabling investors to better assess their potential tax liabilities from cross‑border economic activities and enjoy avoidance of double taxation, thereby creating a more favourable business environment and promoting bilateral trade and investment;

(b) IPPAs were signed with Kuwait, the UAE and Bahrain to further strengthen mutual investment protection, enhance confidence of investors and expand bilateral investment flows;

(c) Mutual Recognition Arrangements on Authorized Economic Operator Programmes were signed with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar to reinforce international cargo security while facilitating legitimate cross-boundary cargo movements of the two places, and strengthen the competitiveness of enterprises from both sides in the international market; and

(d) The MOU in relation to infrastructure and construction were signed with Saudi Arabia to enhance information exchange in the relevant fields and support Hong Kong's professional services to access the market.

 For bilateral trade, according to the statistics from the Census and Statistics Department, the value of bilateral trade in goods (including imports and total exports figures) between Hong Kong and the Middle East (Note 2) during the period of 2022 to 2024 (Note 1) are listed below:

*Value in HK$ million (US$ million)

 During 2021 to 2023 (Note 3), Hong Kong's exports of financial services to the Middle East accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of Hong Kong's total exports of financial services. On the other hand, there is no collected data by the Census and Statistics Department on the share of Hong Kong's exports of technological products to the Middle East.

(2) As a measure announced in the 2025 Policy Address (PA), the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau has set up the Economic and Trade Express which enables overseas ETOs, Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council to enhance collaboration within the region under their respective coverage through a one-stop platform, capitalising on their complementary advantages to promote Hong Kong's trade and investment abroad under the trio-coordinated approach. The Economic and Trade Express focuses on supporting small and medium enterprises and start-ups by proactively organising overseas business missions for relevant enterprises with one stop supporting services (including arrangement of business matching and other activities) to assist Hong Kong enterprises to explore business opportunities in overseas markets including the Middle East. Through this process, Invest Hong Kong will identify overseas enterprises to connect with Hong Kong's business sectors, facilitating more enterprises to invest and establish operations in Hong Kong, thereby promoting two-way flow of enterprises and investments.

 In addition, the Economic and Trade Express will conduct more trade and investment promotional activities and work by pooling the resources of the trio to enhance the scale and impact of such activities.

(3) In the 2023 PA, the CE announced the development of Hong Kong into an international education hub and a cradle for future talents, and in the 2024 PA, the CE emphasised that the Government strives to establish the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand. In the 2025 PA, the CE further announced the establishment of a dedicated Task Force on Study in Hong Kong under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Education in order to further promote Hong Kong's post-secondary education globally and to attract outstanding students and scholars to come to Hong Kong. The Task Force brings together the University Grants Committee (UGC), the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Hong Kong Talent Engage, post-secondary institutions, overseas ETOs, the Mainland Offices, etc for greater promotion of higher education in Hong Kong.

 To support universities' efforts in stepping up the promotion of the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand and to facilitate the development of Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub, the UGC has provided around $40 million to the Heads of Universities Committee's Standing Committee on Internationalisation, which involves the eight UGC-funded universities, in the 2025 to 2028 triennium for participating in and organising various activities outside Hong Kong, and for visiting different places (in particular the Middle East region) to recruit overseas students. Universities have actively expanded their recruitment activities on the Chinese Mainland and overseas, participating in education fairs in specific regions, leveraging existing overseas networks to connect with local chambers of commerce and enterprises, and organising seminars for parents and students who are interested in studying in Hong Kong, etc. Through these efforts, the Education Bureau has stepped up the promotion of various policy measures, including the Belt and Road Scholarship, to attract more students to study in Hong Kong. Starting from the 2024/25 academic year, the annual quota for the Belt and Road Scholarship has been increased to 150 places. In the 2024/25 academic year, the UGC-funded universities organised nearly 200 overseas recruitment activities, many of which targeted the Belt and Road countries, such as the UAE, Jordan and Qatar.

 In attracting non-local students (including those from the Middle East region), starting from the 2024/25 academic year, the admission quota for non-local students in publicly-funded post-secondary institutions (applicable to taught programmes) has doubled from 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the local student places. The funded universities have actively made good use of the expanded quota to recruit more non-local students to pursue education in Hong Kong. In the 2024/25 academic year, these students were from around 100 countries and regions and among them, about 100 students were from the Middle East region. Starting from the 2026/27 academic year, the enrolment ceiling for self-financing non-local students of each funded post-secondary institution will be raised from the level currently equivalent to 40 per cent of the local student places to 50 per cent; and the over-enrolment ceiling of self-financing places of funded research postgraduate programmes will be increased from 100 per cent to 120 per cent.

 In signing exchange agreements with post-secondary institutions in the Middle East region, the UGC has all along been encouraging universities to provide more overseas exchange opportunities for students to gain a better understanding of national development and global trends. As of end November 2024, the UGC-funded universities signed a total of more than 2 600 student exchange agreements with institutions around the world, including 47 agreements with those in the Middle East region.

 With regard to research collaboration, the UGC and the Research Grants Council have been actively promoting stronger international research collaboration between local higher education institutions and overseas organisations, deepening international exchanges and conducting more impactful and cutting-edge research. Such efforts will help strengthen our research capacity. As at end November 2024, more than 50 ongoing research collaboration projects are being carried out by UGC-funded universities with institutions/organisations in the Middle East region, including Israel, the UAE, Türkiye and Saudi Arabia, etc.

 In addition, the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint promulgated in end-2022 set out four broad development directions, including ""to proactively integrate into the overall development of the country and consolidate our role as a bridge connecting the Chinese Mainland and the world"". Hong Kong's three major I&T parks (i.e. the Hong Kong Science Park, Cyberport and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen I&T Park), have all along been actively establishing partnerships around the world. The relevant park companies signed two, four and two collaboration agreements/MOUs with I&T institutions (e.g. research institutes, venture capital funds and technology incubators) in the Middle East region in 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively to foster exchange and collaboration, facilitating I&T enterprises from the two places to establish presence in each other's markets.

 Looking ahead, the three I&T parks will continue to expand their I&T collaboration network in emerging markets (including the Middle East region), and lead I&T enterprises to participate in forums and summits therein. This will showcase Hong Kong's I&T strengths, and further leverage Hong Kong's role and advantages as a bridge connecting the Chinese Mainland and the world.

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2026-01-21 18:35,2026-01-21 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100575.htm,"An incoming male passenger was sentenced to five months' imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (January 21) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming male passenger, aged 29, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (January 20), and seized 43 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $197,700 and a duty potential of about $144,800, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

立法會：房屋局局長就「推行長者房屋政策」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-21 18:30,2026-01-21 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100540.htm,"以下是房屋局局長何永賢今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上就林筱魯議員動議的「推行長者房屋政策」議案的開場發言：

主席：

非常感謝林筱魯議員今日提出的議案，及李鎮強議員和陳文宜議員的修正議案。

社會高齡化是全球大趨勢，香港也不例外。它所衍生的挑戰與機遇，橫跨多個政策範疇。為應對這些挑戰，行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》宣布成立社會高齡化對策工作組，由政務司副司長帶領各政策局制訂對策，涵蓋甚廣，包括安老、醫療、房屋、文化康樂、樂齡科技等範疇，目標在今年提交報告。

就林議員今天提出的議案，我會先介紹房屋局近年來積極打造宜居、共融及長者友善的生活環境所做的工作和成果，其後我會再綜合政府其他為達致「居家安老」這個一貫的安老政策的措施。

公營房屋

過去10年，居住在香港房屋委員會（房委會）公屋的60歲以上長者數目已經由54萬增加至74萬，多了20萬。提供更好的長者支援和更多的長者設施可以說是刻不容緩。

長者友善建築／屋邨設計

要達致「居家安老」，讓長者能夠在自己熟悉和有歸屬感的環境生活，房屋局和房委會一‍直秉承「關懷為本」的精神，積極探討便利長者住戶的措施。我們於二○二四年九月推出了「幸福設計」指引，該指引現已廣泛應用於多個新建屋邨及現有屋邨的改善工程。指引獲得多個境內、外的獎項，印證其創新與貢獻，包括大灣區城市設計大獎、香港規劃師學會周年大獎之銀獎、香港園境師學會年獎之優異獎等，更得到聯合國開發計劃署的報道和詳細介紹。

「幸福設計」提出八個幸福概念，當中兩個就正正是關於「樂齡安居」及「跨代共融」，為長者的需要確立了日常具體實用的設計依據。「樂齡安居」的概念着重於設計年齡友善的環境，例如於電梯內、大堂和走廊兩旁設計一些倚座、在長走廊加設扶手，增加一些清晰易明的圖像化標誌以提升方向辨識度等，不要看輕這些小小的設計改善，其實正正這些小改善可以鼓勵長者輕鬆出門，多與鄰里接觸。

「跨代共融」的概念則是創建多元共融的環境，建立能跨越幾代人的鄰里連結。例子包括在同一個休憩區設置長者康體設施，亦有兒童遊樂空間，讓爺爺嫲嫲到孫仔「老中青幼」都可在同一地方享用適合不同人士的設施。另外，房委會亦已為超過100條現有屋邨，額外增設長者康體設施及器材，供長者住戶作強身健體之用。我們在屋邨內的細節入手，引入這些以人為本的貼心設計，提供日常生活支援設施，點點滴滴地建立更多的歸屬感和幸福感。

屋邨單位內部設計

剛才提到的是屋邨小區層面的設計，而「通用設計」概念亦同樣適用於單位內部設計，讓長者能輕鬆在單位內生活，例如按住戶需要在單位入口設置斜道、擴闊浴室門口、在適當地面鋪設防滑地磚、將浴缸改為淋浴間、採用較大的開關掣和門鐘按鈕，並安裝在適合的高度、在浴室和走廊加設扶手等。如住戶只需要簡單調適，例如在浴室加裝扶手、改成淋浴間或更換推桿式水龍頭，只要通知我們，便可以直接為有需要的住戶免費安排相關工程。房委會亦會根據醫生、物理治療師或其他專業人士的意見，安排其他調適或改裝工程，務求令個別長者住戶的需要得到特別照顧。

關懷長者住戶

上述提到的是硬件方面的提升，更重要的是我們如何用心去關懷守護我們的長者。

積極關懷、主動探訪

首先，我們的前線屋邨管理人員是很重要的，他們會積極主動向長者提供到戶支援，主動上門、多探訪他們，尤其是對於非常高齡、很多90歲以上的長者住戶，我們更會增加探訪的次數；在日常管理中，前線人員亦會特別關注居於樓宇內的長者，如有需要，會主動聯絡相關社福機構提供協助。另外，我們亦會評估長者家居安全並優先安排免費的改善工程，或協助他們申請一些俗稱「平安鐘」的服務。我們會在日常管理中進一步實施強化關懷措施，例如轉介陪診、家居送餐服務等，以確保支援及時、恰當和持續到位。

每日人與人之間的接觸很重要，所以我們的物管團隊是非常重要的一環。為提升物業管理公司前線員工對長者關懷的意識，房委會亦已由去年底開始，在新的物業管理合約中增設支援長者的專項條款，明確要求物業管理公司必須參與社署（社會福利署）推行的「與照顧者同行」計劃，安排至少百分之二十的前線員工，包括物業管理主任和保安員，提供相關的培訓。我們會將參與培訓的員工比例要求逐步提升至百分之五十，讓前線人員學會一些待人處事的技巧，尤其是與長者溝通的技巧，以關懷為本、行動為實的精神去服務長者戶。

房屋署與社署亦在二○二五年六月開始以試點形式建立一個「對比機制」，將房屋署的住戶資料和社署的長者服務使用者資料作對比，以找出住在公屋而仍未接受長者支援或照顧服務的獨老或雙老住戶，然後委託關愛隊接觸及探訪這些住戶，向他們表達關愛及介紹服務例如「平安鐘」等。

社區服務和活動

在二○二六／二七年度，房委會的屋邨管理組會將支援長者納入重點項目，我們會以「邨『友』好事」，「友」是好朋友、「老友記」的「友」，作為年度主題計劃，資助屋邨舉辦跨代共融的社區服務及活動，並積極與不同政府部門及社會上的不同機構建立策略性合作計劃，務求將支援網絡擴展至全港屋邨。例如我們已主動接觸衞生署，於60個公共屋邨合作推廣一個名為「我好叻」的計劃，推廣健康飲食、經常運動及預防肥胖的信息，鼓勵長者培養健康生活習慣。剛才有議員亦提過，這些健康的生活習慣實在可以幫助我們節省很多醫療開支。

房屋署同時亦推動各屋邨與非政府機構、地區組織及企業的義工隊協作，在屋邨內提供流動健康檢查、醫療服務等。我們亦鼓勵更多居民成為義工，尤其剛才亦有議員說「青年老友記」，帶同他們的寵物一起來關心我們的屋邨長者，舉辦更多活動。房屋署邨管的前線團隊會持續協助各政府部門及機構配對服務對象、安排活動場地及協助推廣等，使各項活動能接觸更多長者，讓更多長者知道及配合他們的實際需要。

應用創新科技

未來科技應用，對於我們能更好地照顧長者真的很重要。房屋署已於二○二五年四月挑選了兩個長者居住人數較多的屋邨，即觀塘雲漢邨及何文田常樂邨，試行長者戶大門開關物聯網訊息系統，為自願參與的長者於單位大門安裝感測器，監測大門開關狀態，讓他們指定的親友掌握其出門的情況。若大門在選定的時間內未有開啓，系統會主動向其已登記的聯絡人發出手機提示信號，以便及時提供適切支援。房屋署會於二○二六年挑選另外兩條較多長者居住的公共屋邨，去進一步推展這項計劃，並會檢討成效及制定未來方向，或比對其他試行計劃，以回應長者社區日益增長的安全要求。

此外，房屋署亦會積極研究與其他社福機構及政府部門推行更多關懷長者計劃，例如房屋署已接觸長者安居協會，協助他們推展「一線通安全探測服務」試驗計劃，為約200戶獨居或雙老公屋、居屋長者戶，在室內安裝跌倒探測器，偵測跌倒或長時間無活動的緊急情況。探測器觸發後會自動連接24小時服務支援中心，職員會透過雙向通話確認長者情況；如無法確認安全，會立即通知長者指定的聯絡人，甚至報警求助。我們會繼續探討不同的樂齡科技，以強化長者居家安全。

住屋安排

在制定房屋政策方面，為配合長者的住屋需要及鼓勵年青的家庭照顧年長父母或親屬，房委會有多個針對長者優先編配公屋的安排，包括「共享頤年」、「天倫樂」及「高齡單身人士」優先配屋計劃。凡參加相關優先配屋計劃而符合資格的申請，通常會比一般家庭申請較早獲得處理。例如符合「天倫樂」優先配屋計劃的申請，可獲提早六個月處理。在過去的10年間，已有約七萬個家庭受惠於這些計劃。

房委會的資助出售單位亦推行「家有長者優先選樓計劃」，在銷售計劃預留百分之四十的新推售單位配額，予有60歲以上長者或有初生嬰兒的家庭優先選樓。「居屋2024」（「出售居者有其屋計劃單位2024」）及「綠置居2024」（「出售綠表置居計劃單位2024」），我們一共預留了近4 000個配額予以上兩個類別的家庭優先選購。

此外，房委會將推出「長者業主樓換樓計劃」，容許所有已登記的家庭成員如均年滿60歲或以上，並且擁有資助出售單位滿10年或以上的業主，可在未補價的情況下，於第二市場賣出原有單位後，再在第二市場購買一個面積較小或地區較偏遠的資助出售單位，讓合資格的長者業主選擇遷往更切合他們需要的單位後，可套現作為養老金。計劃細節預計將於今年內敲定，我們稍後會透過不同渠道向長者詳細解說。我們希望到時請各位立法會議員連同區議員和我們一起推廣有關計劃，令更多長者可以參與。

私人樓宇安排、關懷長者住戶

為了支援「居家安老」，由財政司副司長領導的「推動長者友善樓宇設計」工作組已完成制訂了一系列的方案，並已由二○二五年中起分批落實。

另外，要達致「居家安老」，需要多方面的社區安老服務和照顧支援的配合。為此，社署在全港設立215間長者地區中心和長者鄰舍中心，在地區層面為長者提供多項支援服務，並透過外展服務及社區網絡，識別有潛在服務需要的長者，並為他們提供適切援助。

總結

主席，大家可以見到政府，包括房屋局及其他很多政策局，都在多方面同心攜手，從不同層面關心和支援長者，目標是按他們的實際需要，打造一個宜居、共融及讓大家更有歸屬感的生活環境。現在我會細心聆聽各位議員的發言及提議，待會在總結時我會再作進一步的補充和回應。

多謝主席。"

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-21 17:30,2026-01-21 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100495.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 21), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

LCQ1: Promoting digital education,2026-01-21 17:30,2026-01-21 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100492.htm,"​Following is a question by the Hon Ken Wong and a reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

In recent years, the Government has actively promoted digital education with a view to fostering educational innovation. Nevertheless, there are views pointing out that considerable disparities currently exist among Hong Kong schools in promoting digital education, and that frontline teachers' confidence and capabilities in utilising digital technology in teaching also vary. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of training courses relating to digital education organised by the authorities for in-service teachers in the past academic year; whether the effectiveness of such courses in enhancing teachers' ability to apply digital technology in the classroom has been evaluated; if so, of the evaluation mechanism and the results thereof; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has plans to include artificial intelligence (AI) as a compulsory domain in teachers' continuing professional development, and to incorporate competence in digital education as a prerequisite for teachers' professional development and promotion; if so, of the details and implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it will expand the Digital Education Centre of Excellence Scheme to encourage teacher teams with successful experience to provide on-site support to other schools, so as to assist frontline teachers in integrating AI into teaching and learning; if so, of the details; if not, what alternative measures are in place to promote inter-school sharing of experience and resources?

Reply:

President,

To align with the national strategy of invigorating the country through science and education, the Education Bureau (EDB) has implemented various measures in primary and secondary schools to promote digital education, support teaching innovation and nuture innovative talent. The competence of teachers is key to the effective implementation of digital education.

​The reply to the question raised by the Hon Ken Wong is as follows:

(1) To equip teachers to embrace the opportunities and challenges brought by digital education, the EDB adopts a diversified training approach, emphasising both quality and quantity, to continuously advance teacher professional development. Across the 2024/25 and 2025/26 school year, over 70 000 training places will be provided, ensuring that all teachers in publicly-funded schools in Hong Kong have the opportunity to participate in training, thereby establishing a solid professional foundation for the implementation of digital education.
  
In the 2024/25 school year, the EDB has rolled out a series of teacher professional development activities, including organising over 430 digital education professional development programmes for teachers, offering more than 35 000 training places. The EDB has also organised a featured programme, ""AI Unleashed - Exploring the Depths for Educators"", providing 940 training places, enabling teachers to deepen their understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and its applications and broaden their horizons through thematic talks and a study tour to the Greater Bay Area. The curriculum leadership seminar organised by the EDB themed effective use of AI to promote curriculum developments in primary schools also attracted participation from over 120 primary schools with nearly 350 principals and teachers, fostering inter-school experience exchange and collaboration.
  
In addition, the Digital Education Centre of Excellence (CoE) established by the EDB promotes digital education through seminars and on-site support. The CoE organises in-service teachers to share their practices of digital education and explore the application of AI in teaching, thereby promoting peer learning. In the past year, the CoE offered over 200 training programmes for teachers with more than 14 000 training places, and nearly 140 times of on-site support services. Meanwhile, teaching demonstrations and lesson observation activities were also conducted on the campuses to share good practices in teaching. The support services of the CoE have covered more than 90 per cent of the publicly-funded primary and secondary schools, and the participating schools generally agree that the services meet their needs and help enhance teaching effectiveness.
 
Regarding the effectiveness of teacher training, in addition to conducting post-training surveys upon completion of training programmes, the EDB also provides on-site support services and organises lesson observation activities to evaluate the implementation. The EDB also invited all primary and secondary schools across the territory to take part in the Survey on Digital Education for the 2024/25 school year, with a response rate of nearly 92 per cent. The survey findings revealed that over 95 per cent of the teachers showed confidence in using e-tools to enhance teaching effectiveness; were able to grasp the essence of using e-tools to improve teaching effectiveness; and were able to make use of various e-tools to help students, inter alia, unleash their creativity and solve daily problems with technology. These findings are consistent with the usual training data, which indicate that teachers have built a good foundation in applying digital tools in teaching.

(2) With technology advancing at an unprecedented pace and societal expectations for teachers constantly rising, teachers must keep abreast of the times. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is key to the quality assurance of teaching. To this end, the EDB has established a professional development training framework for teachers, requiring all in-service teachers to complete 150 hours of CPD every three years. Within each three-year cycle, a minimum of 30 hours must be allocated to two categories of core training, namely ""Teachers' Professional Roles, Values and Conduct"" and ""Local, National and International Education Issues"", with not less than six hours spent on each category. The training framework allows teachers to utilise their training hours with openness and flexibility to participate in various activities or programmes that align with the needs of schools, students and their own professional development. AI and digital education fall under the category of ""Local, National and International Education Issues"". Currently, schools can devise school-based CPD plans according to their specific school context to facilitate teachers in fulfilling the training requirements.
 
Regarding the promotion criteria for teachers in aided schools, in addition to meeting the qualification requirements stipulated in the Codes of Aid, teachers must also complete the specified promotion training programmes within five years prior to their date of substantive promotion. The core training is provided by the EDB, and currently includes content on digital education. The elective training allows teachers to undertake relevant training based on the professional expertise required for the respective promotion posts. Given the varying contexts of different schools and the different professional duties of promotion posts, we do not recommend setting uniform and rigid criteria.

(3) Moving forward, the EDB will further expand the support services of the CoE and organise more seconded teachers to provide support in other schools. The number of resource schools has increased from 13 in the previous school year (2024/25) to 18, the number of seconded teachers has expanded from 26 to 34, and the number of support service items has increased from 16 to 23. In addition to focusing on areas such as promoting information literacy, e-assessment, using information technology to support students with special educational needs, and blended mode of learning, the support will also incorporate more AI elements, for example, how to plan the application of AI in teaching, AI in pedagogical and curriculum design, as well as AI and educational ethics.

The EDB will also implement various measures to encourage inter-school experience exchange and resource sharing. These include strengthening school-based professional support services, and supporting schools in integrating digital education tools into different Key Learning Areas/subjects. In addition, the Mainland-Hong Kong Teachers Exchange and Collaboration Programme will also facilitate cross-regional experience sharing and observation, thereby enhancing teachers' professional competence.

In addition, we will be launching progressively a new series of AI professional development programmes, which cover the core AI literacy areas required by school leaders and teachers, including ""AI Literacy courses"", ""AI+Subjects courses"", and ""AI Leadership courses"". This will enable teachers to participate in relevant training according to their needs of teaching and job positions.
 
In fact, given the varying school circumstances, the extent and pace of implementing digital education differ among schools. In addition to providing teacher training with emphasis on both quality and quantity, the EDB also encourages diverse school-based practices and promotes experience exchange and resource sharing through various school-based support and inter-school sharing activities to accelerate the pace of development of digital education.
  
In summary, building on existing strengths and foundations, the EDB will continue to optimise teacher professional training and school-based support services through a multi-pronged approach. We will also keep pace with the latest development of digital education, timely review the effectiveness and adjust strategies, to equip schools and teachers with the capacity to apply innovative technology to assist teaching, thereby fostering pedagogical innovation and enhancing learning effectiveness.

Thank you, President."

立法會一題：推動數字教育,2026-01-21 17:30,2026-01-21 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100483.htm,"​以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上黃錦良議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的答覆︰

問題：

政府近年積極推動數字教育，致力促進教育創新。然而，有意見指出，目前本港學校在推動數字教育上的差異甚大，前線教師在運用數字科技進行教學的信心及能力也有參差。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去一個學年，當局為在職教師舉辦了多少個與數字教育相關的培訓課程；有否評估該等課程對提升教師在課堂上應用數字科技的成效；如有，評估機制及結果為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）有否計劃將人工智能列為教師持續專業發展的必修範疇，以及將數字教育能力，納入為教師專業發展及晉升的必要條件；如有，詳情及推行時間表為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）會否擴大數字教育卓越中心計劃，鼓勵具成功經驗的教師團隊到其他學校提供到校支援，協助前線教師將人工智能融入教學；如會，詳情為何；如否，有何其他措施促進校際經驗及資源分享？

答覆：

主席：

配合國家科教興國戰略，教育局於中小學推行多項措施，推動數字教育，支持教學創新，培育創科人才。要做好數字教育，教師的能力是關鍵。

就黃錦良議員的提問，重點回覆如下：

（一）為裝備教師迎接數字教育帶來的機遇與挑戰，教育局通過多元培訓，質量並重，持續推進教師專業發展。二○二四／二五學年和二○二五／二六學年，一共提供七萬多個名額，讓全港所有公帑資助學校教師都有機會參與培訓，為數字教育的實施奠定札實的專業基礎。

單在二○二四／二五學年，教育局推出一系列教師專業發展活動，舉辦了430多個數字教育培訓課程，提供超過三萬五千個培訓名額，同時亦組織主題活動，例如「智啟未來：人工智能發展探索」，設940個名額，讓教師通過專題講座及大灣區學習團，加深對人工智能技術和應用的理解，拓寛視野。另外又舉辦「善用人工智能促進小學課程發展」課程領導研討會，亦吸引了超過120所小學，近350名校長及教師參與，促進校際經驗交流及協作。

另外，由教育局成立的數字教育卓越中心（卓越中心），通過講座及到校支援，支持數字教育。卓越中心組織現職教師，分享數字教育的實踐，探討人工智能在教學上的應用，促進同儕學習。過去一年，中心提供超過200個教師培訓課程，超過一萬四千個培訓名額，近140次到校支援服務；又通過開放校園，進行教學示範及觀課，推廣成功的課堂應用。目前，卓越中心的支援服務，覆蓋超過九成公帑資助中小學，參與學校普遍都認同服務切合學校需要，有助提升教學效能。

就教師培訓的成效，教育局除了在培訓課程完成後進行問卷調查外，同時亦通過到校支援和觀課等，了解實施的情況，亦於二○二四／二五學年，向全港中小學進行「數字教育調查」，學校的回覆率近百分之九十二。調查結果顯示，超過九成半教師具信心使用電子工具以提升教學效能；能掌握使用電子工具以提升教學的精髓；並能運用各種電子工具以支援學生發揮創意及運用科技解決日常生活問題等。調查結果與平日的培訓數據相符，同時亦顯示教師應用數字教學已經具備一定的基礎。

（二）科技發展一日千里，社會對教師的期望亦日益提高，教師必須與時並進。持續專業發展，正是質素保證的關鍵。為此，教育局為教師訂定專業培訓框架，要求所有在職教師，每三年完成150小時的持續專業發展。在三年周期中，劃出不少於30小時參與有關「教師專業角色、價值觀及操守」及「本地、國家及國際教育議題」兩大範疇的核心培訓，其中，每範疇須最少六小時。培訓框架容許教師開放及靈活運用進修時數，以配合學校、學生及個人專業發展需要，選擇不同的活動和課程。人工智能及數字教育屬「本地、國家及國際教育議題」範疇，目前，學校可因應校情，制定校本持續專業發展計劃，協助教師達到培訓要求。

至於資助學校教師的晉升條件，除了需要符合《資助則例》有關的資歷要求外，亦須實行在晉升日期前五年內，完成指定的晉升培訓課程。核心培訓由教育局提供，現時已包括數字教育的內容；選修培訓則由教師按晉升崗位所需的專業知識修讀相關培訓。由於校情不同，晉升崗位所負責的專業職務亦不同，我們不建議設定劃一的硬性條件。

（三）未來，教育局會進一步擴大卓越中心的支援服務，組織更多借調教師，到學校提供支援服務。目前，資源學校的數目，由上一學年（二○二四／二五）的13所增至18所；借調教師由26位擴大至34位，支援項目由16項擴展至23項。支援重點除了推廣資訊素養、電子評估、運用資訊科技支援有特殊教育需要學生、提供混合模式學習等外，亦加入了更多人工智能元素，例如如何規劃人工智能於教學上的應用、人工智能於學與教及課程設計、人工智能與教育倫理等。

教育局亦會通過不同措施，鼓勵校際經驗交流及資源共享，包括加強校本專業支援服務，支援學校將數字教育工具，引入不同的學習領域或科目。另外，亦會通過「內地與香港教師交流及協作計劃」，推進跨地域的經驗交流觀摩，提升教師專業能力。

我們亦將陸續推出新一系列的人工智能（AI）專業培訓課程，內容涵蓋學校領導與教師所需的AI素養核心範疇，包括「AI素養課程」、「AI+科目課程」和「AI領導培訓課程」等，讓教師按教學及工作崗位需要，參加相關培訓。

事實上，由於校情不一，學校推行數字教育的幅度和速度均存在差異。教育局除了提供質量並重的教師培訓之外，亦鼓勵多元化的校本實踐，並通過不同的校本支援及校際交流分享活動等，促進經驗交流及資源共享，加快數字教育的發展步伐。

總而言之，教育局會建基現有優勢和基礎，透過多重進路，持續優化教師專業培訓和校本支援服務，配合數字教育最新發展，適時檢視成效，調整策略，裝備學校及教師應用創新科技輔助教學的能力，推動教學創新，提升學習效能。

多謝主席。"
Court makes review decision on sentencing for violating occupational safety and health legislation,2026-01-21 17:15,2026-01-21 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100508.htm,"​Regarding the sentencing in a fatal industrial accident, the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (January 21) handed down a review decision, accepting the prosecution's application for review of an earlier court sentence and increasing the fines imposed on the contractor.

The case involved a fatal accident that occurred on August 19, 2023, at a construction site in Chek Lap Kok, Lantau. A worker, while carrying out electrical installation work on the false ceiling of a building under construction, received an electric shock. The worker subsequently lost consciousness and passed away on the same day.

Hip Seng Builders Limited was prosecuted by the Labour Department (LD) for violations of the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations and the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Electricity) Regulations, and was fined $261,000 at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on January 23, 2025.

After the sentencing, the prosecution filed a review application with the court regarding the sentences imposed on the relevant contractor. The review hearing was brought up today before the court. The fines imposed on Hip Seng Builders Limited were increased to $521,000.

A spokesman for the LD said that the ruling will disseminate a strong message to all contractors that they have to protect workers' safety and health at work in accordance with the laws. The prosecution will continue to pay attention to court rulings and will file review or appeal applications for cases where the sentences are manifestly inadequate and/or wrong in principle."
Hong Kong Customs and FSD mount operation against illicit fuel storage site and illegal fueling stations (with photos),2026-01-21 17:15,2026-01-21 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100405.htm,"Hong Kong Customs and the Fire Services Department (FSD) mounted a territory-wide joint operation codenamed ""Knockout"" targeting illicit fuel activities during the past two weeks (January 5 to 18), aiming to cut off the supply of illicit fuel and tackle illegal fueling activities in the downtown area. During the operation, Customs and the FSD detected eight cases and seized a total of about 7 100 litres of illegal motor spirit and 60 000 litres of diesel with an estimated market value of about $1.9 million. Seven vehicles involved in the cases were detained.

During the operation, officers of Customs and the FSD shut down three mobile illicit motor spirit fueling stations and two illicit diesel fueling stations in Kowloon Bay, Tsz Wan Shan, Tsing Yi and Tuen Mun. About 3 100 litres of illicit motor spirit, 60 000 litres of diesel and a large batch of fueling equipment were seized. Seven persons, believed to be the persons-in-charge of the illegal fueling stations, and three men who were coming for fueling, aged between 34 and 66, were involved in the cases. A total of six vehicles involved were also seized.

In addition, on January 8, 12 and 15, Customs officers dismantled one illicit motor spirit storage site and two illicit motor spirit fueling stations in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long. In the illicit motor spirit fueling station located in a tin-sheet structure in Tuen Mun, a cross-boundary truck which was unloading illicit motor spirit was intercepted. A 37-year-old non-local man, being the truck driver, and a 54-year-old non-local woman, believed to be the operator of the illegal fueling station, were arrested. A total of about 4 000 litres of illicit motor spirit, one cross-boundary truck and batches of fueling equipment were seized in the three cases.

The 12 individuals involved in the cases are suspected of dealing with or buying illicit fuel, violating various ordinances including the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Dangerous Goods Ordinance (DGO). Investigations are ongoing.

Customs will continue to collaborate with the FSD in combating illicit fuel activities. Members of the public are also urged not to patronise illegal fueling stations. The use of illicit fuel is a criminal offence, and vehicles involved may be liable to confiscation.

According to the DCO, any vehicle found conveying illicit motor spirit, as well as any tools, equipment, or articles used or intended to be used in connection with the commission of related offences, shall be liable to forfeiture whether or not any person is convicted of any offence. Anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit motor spirit commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Under the Fire Services (Fire Hazard Abatement) Regulation, it is an offence to possess or control any controlled substance for the business purpose of transferring it into vehicle fuel tanks. The DGO also provides that no person shall manufacture, store, convey or use any dangerous goods unless they possess a licence or exemption granted. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty for the first offence is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for six months. For each subsequent offence, the maximum penalty is a $200,000 fine and imprisonment for one year.

Moreover, Customs reminds cross-boundary goods vehicle drivers not to engage in any smuggling activities. Under the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO), any vehicle found to have the fittings, fabric or structure altered and used for smuggling purposes may be subject to forfeiture.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public are urged to report suspected illegal fuel activities via the Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or the FSD's 24-hour reporting hotline 5577 9666. The public may also report through the Illicit Fuelling Activities on the Fire Hazard Electronic Complaint Portal of the FSD (fhcp.hkfsd.gov.hk)."
