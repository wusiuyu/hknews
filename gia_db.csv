  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 5 to noon today (December 8), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 343 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-12-08 12:46,2025-12-08 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800446.htm,"An incoming male passenger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $2,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (December 8) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted a 31-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (December 7). About 13 900 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $62,000 and a duty potential of about $46,000, were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Professor Yang (Senior Vice-President (Innovation and Enterprise) of the City University of Hong Kong (CityU), Professor Michael Yang), Professor Noble (Technikos Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Professorial Fellow of St Hilda's College of the University of Oxford Professor Alison Noble), Professor Shum (Vice-President (Research) of CityU, Professor Anderson Shum), Professor Chan (Director of the Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-Cardiovascular Health Engineering, Professor Kannie Chan), Terry (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, Mr Terry Wong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you all today at the 2nd International Cerebro-cardiovascular Medical Innovation Summit organised by the Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-Cardiovascular Health Engineering, COCHE in short.

 Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Today's Summit provides a vital platform for interdisciplinary exchange and dialogue among world-class experts. We are happy to see the gathering of experts from different disciplines dedicated to addressing critical challenges and advancing medical innovation in cerebro-cardiovascular health - a domain that directly impacts millions of lives worldwide.

 Pursuant to the country's 14th Five-Year Plan and the 15th Five-Year Plan proposal to develop Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is committed to building a vibrant I&T ecosystem. Amongst our efforts, InnoHK stands out as a flagship I&T initiative that has successfully established a total of 30 research centres in Hong Kong, collaborating with more than 30 world-renowned universities and research institutes from 12 economies, pooling more than 3 000 researchers locally and from all over the world.

  The COCHE, one of the InnoHK centres in the area of life and health sciences and the organiser of this Summit, specialises in developing innovative technologies for the early prediction and intervention of cardiovascular diseases. With strategic partnerships with world-leading institutions including the University of Oxford and the Karolinska Institutet, the Centre has made significant advancements in AI-powered imaging, biosensing, and drug delivery systems by strategic partnership since its establishment in December 2020. This shows us how breakthroughs can be achieved through global research collaboration. Through shared datasets and cross-border clinical validation, the participating institutions integrated the Centre's technical innovation and clinical applications. Besides, students from the University of Oxford visited the COCHE in 2024 with an aim of strengthening academic exchange and cultivating future talent. Such exchanges of talents lay a fertile ground for Hong Kong to develop an international research hub.

 Building on the successes of the first two InnoHK clusters which focus on life and health sciences as well as AI and robotics, we are expediting the establishment of the third InnoHK research cluster which focus on sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing, and materials. This cluster aims to drive the development of new industrialisation in Hong Kong and promote the development of advanced technologies and the related industries.

 Ladies and gentlemen, innovation does not happen in isolation. It thrives through collaboration. As we gather here today, let us reaffirm our commitment to working together for the betterment of humanity. With the concerted efforts of the Government, academia, research institutions and industry partners, I am confident that our I&T ecosystem will not only thrive, but also strengthen Hong Kong's competitive edge. May I wish the 2nd ICMIS every success. Thank you."

立法會換屆選舉點票順利完成（附圖）,2025-12-08 09:48,2025-12-08 10:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800285.htm,"下稿代選舉管理委員會發出：

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉的點票工作於今日（十二月八日）清晨約六時順利完成。昨晚（十二月七日）十一時三十分投票結束後，點票工作隨即展開，點算了約1 317 680張地方選區選票、約76 940張功能界別選票，以及1 458張選舉委員會界別選票。

選舉管理委員會（選管會）主席陸啟康法官總結選舉時說：「是次選舉共有1 317 682名選民投票，累積投票率為31.9%。整體而言，投票和點票過程大致暢順，各項選舉安排充分體現公開、誠實和公平的原則，選管會滿意整體安排。」

選管會非常感謝參與選舉工作的決策局／部門，特別是危機管理委員會成員，包括政制及內地事務局、民政及青年事務局、保安局、香港警務處、數字政策辦公室、民政事務總署、政府新聞處、律政司、機電工程署、運輸署和香港天文台提供各方面的全力支援。另外，廉政公署和其他執法機關作出妥善安排，亦令選舉得以順利進行。選管會亦非常感謝技術諮詢委員會就核心選舉系統提供寶貴的專業意見。

是次選舉投票站數目超過600個，投票時間亦延長至16個小時，加上先導安排下多項新的投票安排措施，包括因應一些有特定需要的選民群組，如公務員、醫護人員、少數族裔居民等設立專屬投票站，同時為一些居住於安老院和殘疾人士院舍的選民提供外展投票服務，亦增加了鄰近邊境投票站的數目；在大埔火災後，選舉事務處須在短時間內為區內的三個投票站作出調整，並在政府物流服務署的全力協助，以及在「全政府動員」機制下參與的入境事務處和海關人員，於投票時段內為受影響選民安排免費接駁交通，便利有關選民前往新票站投票。以上安排均為選舉工程帶來一定的挑戰。選管會因此特別多謝選舉事務處及各投票站和點票站工作人員緊守崗位、各司其職，盡全力應付大量的工作。選管會亦感謝各決策局／部門首長為是次選舉提名選舉工作人員，並批准有關人員短暫離開工作崗位，參加選舉事務處安排的培訓及實習演練，令今次選舉暢順有序地舉行。

選管會將按法例規定檢討是次選舉安排，並於三個月內向行政長官提交報告書。

選管會最後感謝所有投票的選民利用手上神聖的一票，選出新一屆立法會；亦感謝傳媒對選舉事務的報道，以及候選人和助選團的合作，使投票和點票在公開、誠實和公平的情況下，安全、有序和高效地進行。"
Counting of votes for Legislative Council General Election completed smoothly (with photos),2025-12-08 09:48,2025-12-08 10:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800286.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Electoral Affairs Commission:

  The counting of votes for the 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE) was completed smoothly at around 6am today (December 8). The poll closed at 11.30pm last night (December 7) and the counting of about 1 317 680 geographical constituency (GC) ballot papers, about 76 940 functional constituency ballot papers and 1 458 Election Committee constituency ballot papers commenced soon afterward.

  ""For the LCGE, about 1 317 682 electors have cast their votes, with a cumulative GC turnout rate of 31.9 per cent. Overall, the polling and counting processes proceeded smoothly and all arrangements for the LCGE have reflected the principle of openness, honesty and fairness. The Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) is satisfied with the arrangements,"" the Chairman of the EAC, Mr Justice David Lok, said on the conclusion of the LCGE.

  The EAC is very thankful to the bureaux/departments (B/Ds) involved in the LCGE, especially the Crisis Management Committee members which include the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Security Bureau, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Digital Policy Office, the Home Affairs Department, the Information Services Department, the Department of Justice, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, the Transport Department and the Hong Kong Observatory for their full support in various aspects. In addition, the Independent Commission Against Corruption and other law enforcement agencies have made appropriate arrangements for the smooth conduct of the LCGE. The EAC would also like to thank the Technical Advisory Committee for their valuable professional input to the election-related mission critical systems.

  There were more than 600 polling stations in the LCGE with polling duration extended to 16 hours. Also added in the LCGE were various new electoral work under the pilot arrangements, including introducing Designated Polling Stations for the groups of electors with specific needs such as civil servants, healthcare staff and ethnic minorities residents; providing outreach polling service to electors residing in residential care homes for the elderly and persons with disabilities; as well as increasing the number of Near Boundary Polling Stations. After the fire in Tai Po, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) needed to make adjustments for three polling stations in the district within a short period of time. With the full assistance by the Government Logistics Department, and the efforts of staff members of the Immigration Department and the Customs and Excise Department under the ""government-wide mobilisation"" mechanism, free feeder transportation services were offered to the affected electors during the polling hours so that they can travel to the reallocated polling stations conveniently to cast their votes. The aforesaid arrangements posed substantial challenges to the whole election process. In this connection, the EAC extends its special thanks to the staff of the REO and the polling and counting staff for their contributions and efforts made in coping with a large amount of work in their respective positions; as well as the heads of various B/Ds for nominating electoral staff for the LCGE, and for approving them to leave their positions briefly to participate in trainings and drills arranged by the REO which enabled the election be held smoothly and orderly.

  As prescribed by the law, the EAC will submit a report on the review of the electoral arrangements of the LCGE to the Chief Executive within three months.

  Last but not least, the EAC would like to thank all electors who have voted for casting their sacred votes and electing the new Legislative Council. The EAC is also thankful to the media for reporting the electoral affairs; and candidates and their agents for their co-operation, so that the polling and counting processes were conducted openly, honestly and fairly, and in a safe, orderly and efficient manner."

CE: Government to drive reform with new-term LegCo as election successfully concludes,2025-12-08 08:19,2025-12-08 08:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800266.htm,"âThe Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, made the following statement today (December 8) after the announcement of the results of the eighth Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election:

The eighth LegCo General Election has successfully concluded, with the election results for all 90 seats announced. On behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, I would like to extend my congratulations to all LegCo Members successfully returned. I also thank the 161 candidates from different sectors, professions and backgrounds, as well as all sectors of the community, for their active participation.

The smooth and successful conduct of the election at a time when the Hong Kong community is collectively facing a difficult period carries profound significance. It demonstrates electors' support for the Government's commitment to recovery and reform following the tragedy, and for electing capable and committed LegCo Members to drive institutional reform. It showcases the spirit of unity, mutual care and support among the people of Hong Kong.

The successful conclusion of the LegCo General Election as scheduled reflects our adherence to and respect for the constitutional order and the rule of law. The election was the second LegCo General Election held after the implementation of the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"" and the improved electoral system. Candidates actively participated in 39 open election forums, engaging in a high-quality, high-standard and healthy competition based on the principle of broad representation, balanced participation and fair competition.

I thank every one of the electors who have cast their vote for actively exercising their civic rights and responsibilities. Their passion for the election at this crucial time of recovery showed their unity in the face of challenges. They have elected an eighth-term LegCo composed of patriots who love Hong Kong and possess both integrity and capability, who will work with the Government in building a better Hong Kong - a home for us all.

To facilitate electors, the Government introduced a number of pioneering arrangements in this election, including extending polling hours by two hours to 16 hours, setting up Designated Polling Stations and Outreach Polling Stations for the convenience of various groups, and establishing Near Boundary Polling Stations to facilitate electors travelling to and from the Mainland and overseas. The overall polling process was smooth. The Government will review the experience to further enhance the procedures. I thank the Electoral Affairs Commission for its comprehensive and meticulous preparations, and the participation and efforts of all staff and volunteers involved in the election. Their work have ensured the election was concluded smoothly in an open, fair, honest, safe and orderly manner.

The community has gone through this difficult period brought by the fire together.I expect the eighth-term LegCo Members to join hands with the HKSAR Government to undertake support and recovery work following the tragedy. Through initiating debates, promoting the review and updating of legislation, and driving systemic reforms, we will make Hong Kong a safer city where citizens could live with greater peace of mind.

Under the executive-led system and the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"", the executive and the legislature will further engage in constructive interaction, complementing each other with due checks and balances to open up new ground for Hong Kong through innovation and reform, continuously develop the economy, and enhance people's livelihood. I am confident that the new-term LegCo Members will actively engage with the community and various sectors, better understand public opinion, proffer their views and advice, and lead the deepening reforms of Hong Kong together with the HKSAR Government to create a shared future together."
行政長官：選舉順利舉行 政府與新一屆立法會共同推進改革,2025-12-08 08:16,2025-12-08 08:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/08/P2025120800184.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（十二月八日）在第八屆立法會選舉結果公布後，發表以下聲明：

第八屆立法會選舉已經圓滿完成，所有90席立法會議員的結果已經公布。我代表香港特別行政區政府恭賀各成功當選議員，並感謝161名來自不同界別、專業和背景的參選人和社會各界的積極參與。

在香港社會共同面對挑戰的時刻，選舉順利成功舉行具有深刻意義，體現選民支持政府災後重建和改革向前的決心，支持選出有能力、有抱負的立法會議員支援災民和善後重建，推動制度改革，亦展現出市民團結一致和互愛互助的精神。

立法會換屆選舉如期順利成功舉行，是對憲制秩序和法治精神的遵守和尊重。今次選舉是落實「愛國者治港」原則、完善選舉制度後的第二次立法會選舉，各候選人積極參與了39場公開選舉論壇，進行高質量、高水平的良性競爭，體現了廣泛代表性、均衡參與和公平競爭的原則。

我感謝每一位投票的選民積極行使公民權利和責任，在推動災後重建的重要時刻踴躍投票，團結一心面對挑戰，選出了愛國愛港、德才兼備的第八屆立法會議員，與政府共同建設更美好的香港家園。

為便利選民，政府在今次選舉推出多項先驅性安排，包括投票時間延長兩小時至十六小時，並為方便不同群組設立專屬投票站和外展投票站，又設立鄰近邊境投票站，便利往返內地及海外的選民。整體投票過程暢順，政府會總結經驗，進一步優化各環節。我感謝選舉管理委員會全面和周詳的準備，以及參與選務工作的全體人員與義工等各人的投入和付出，讓這次選舉在公開、公正、誠實及安全有序的情況下順利完成。

社會共同經歷了火災帶來的艱難時期，我期望第八屆立法會議員會與特區政府共同推動災後支援和重建工作，透過展開辯論、推動法例檢討和修訂，推行系統性改革，讓香港更安全、市民更安心。

在行政主導和「愛國者治港」原則相適應下，行政立法進一步良性互動，互相配合、互相制衡，在創新改革中打開新局面，持續發展經濟，改善民生。我深信，新一屆立法會議員將深入社區、聯繫各界，了解民情，建言獻策，與特區政府共同帶領香港深化改革，同創未來。"

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-07 22:40,2025-12-07 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700783.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
------------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3 billion as of 1pm today (December 7). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.3 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

  The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance to each affected household. As of today, 1 273 cases have been processed. The living allowance is increased from $50,000 to $100,000 and will be disbursed in phases. In addition, the Support Fund will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 90 cases have been processed.

  In addition, the Government has so far disbursed an emergency subsidy of $10,000 to 1 931 households.

  Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 970 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
------------------------------

  As of this morning, a total of 1 408 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 2 702 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Moreover, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

Relief supplies and donations
------------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received about 1 600 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items to places in need in phases. So far, over 4 800 pieces of donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Handling of reported missing persons
---------------------------------------------

  The Police have completed searches inside all seven buildings. Officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit (DVIU) continued to search the area around the buildings and near the collapsed scaffolding today, which had been confirmed as safe. No human remains were found, and the number of the deceased remains at 159. The Police are contacting the families of the missing persons and those who have preliminarily identified the deceased through photographs to arrange for them to undergo DNA oral swab sampling in batches starting tomorrow (December 8) for scientific identification of the deceased.

Investigations
-----------------

  The Fire Services Department officers assisted the DVIU in removing accumulated water from the elevator shafts of Wang Kin House, Wang Tai House, Wang Cheong House and Wang Shing House to facilitate the search operations.

Regulation and inspection work
--------------------------------------

  The emergency maintenance contractors co-ordinated by the Housing Department have largely completed the clearance of miscellaneous items at the surroundings of the buildings at Wang Fuk Court today. With the protective nets removed from the four Home Ownership Scheme courts, namely Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme, the Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau has requested registered inspectors to arrange for contractors to check on the conditions of the scaffoldings and remove waste and miscellaneous items to ensure safety on-site. The ICU will continue to conduct inspections and monitor the situations.

  Regarding the order to remove scaffold nets issued by the Buildings Department (BD), as of 6pm today, 224 private buildings have had their scaffold nets removed from the external walls. Four cases undergoing removal work have requested an extension of time, and the BD has accepted their applications. It is expected that the work will be finished within this week. The removal work of scaffold nets from the remaining two private buildings has been affected by ongoing contractual disputes between the contractors and the incorporated owners (the disputes existed prior to the Tai Po fire). The BD has arranged for government contractors to carry out the work and will recover the costs later. In addition, the Architectural Services Department has completed the removal of scaffold nets at the government buildings under its purview before the deadline.

  The BD strives to announce a new set of arrangements within this week requiring the scaffold nets used at construction sites to be sampled on-site and certified as compliant with the relevant standards prior to installation so that the relevant external wall work can resume as soon as possible.

  The 5 000 training places of Multi-skilled/Skill Enhancement courses reserved by the Construction Industry Council for workers affected by the suspension of repair work on external walls (trades including plumbing, window framing, painting and decoration, plastering, and bamboo scaffolding) will be open for application tomorrow. The courses are tuition-free. Depending on the specific trade courses and training hours, workers who complete the training and obtain qualifications can receive a maximum subsidy ranging from $14,000 to $19,000.

  The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 332 construction sites, issued a total of 170 written warnings and 95 improvement notices, and taken out 25 prosecutions."

政府公布跟進大埔火災最新情況,2025-12-07 20:55,2025-12-07 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700722.htm,"政府就大埔宏福苑火災成立的三個工作組——調查及規管工作組、緊急支援及募捐工作組，以及應急住宿安排工作組——正全力持續跟進火災的支援、善後及調查事宜，詳情如下：

經濟及福利援助
———————

截至今日（十二月七日）下午一時，政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」已收到的外界捐款約30億元，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，基金總額約為33億元，會用在協助居民重建家園，是長期和持續的支援。

政府早前宣布基金會向每戶受影響家庭發放生活津貼，截至今日已處理1 273宗個案；生活津貼金額已由五萬元增至十萬元，政府會陸續發放有關款項。另外，基金會就每名死者向家屬發放20萬元慰問金及五萬元殮葬金，截至今日已處理90宗個案。

此外，政府至今已向1 931戶派發一萬元應急補助金。

社會福利署（社署）社工目前已接觸超過1 970個受影響住戶，為超過4 900名居民登記「一戶一社工」的跟進服務。社署會與受影響住戶保持聯繫，為他們提供一切所需協助，並全力支援政府的善後工作。尚未與社署聯絡的居民，請盡快致電182 183提供聯絡方法。

住宿援助
————

截至今日上午，共有1 408名居民入住由民政及青年事務局協調的青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間；另有2 702名居民入住房屋局的過渡性房屋或香港房屋協會項目的單位。此外，大埔民政事務處現維持一所位於大埔社區中心的臨時庇護中心對外開放，供有需要人士使用；另一所位於東昌街社區會堂的臨時庇護中心，則會繼續運作至所有使用者全部遷往經安排的應急住宿為止。

物資援助／捐獻
———————

政府與資訊科技業界構建的物資捐獻網上平台繼續運作，團體及市民可於平台登記可捐贈的物資。政府至今共收到接近1 600個登記，其中約三成由機構提出，而餘下的由市民個人提出。已登記可捐獻物品種類涵蓋食品及飲品、衣物、日常生活用品、寢具、電器等多個類別。政府正透過相關政策局、政府部門和服務團體掌握居民的實際需要後進行物資配對工作，以便陸續把適用物資派送往有需要的地點。至今已有超過4 800件涵蓋不同類別的物資配送至多個地點。物資配對和分發工作會持續進行。

處理報稱失聯人士個案
——————————

警方已完成所有七幢大廈內部範圍的搜索工作。「災難遇害者辨認組」人員今日繼續在已確定安全的大廈外圍及倒塌棚架附近進行搜索，暫未有發現遺骸，死者數目維持159人。警方正聯絡失聯人士及已憑相片初步辨認遺體的家屬，安排他們由明日（十二月八日）開始分批進行脫氧核糖核酸口腔拭子採樣，以作科學鑑定辨別遺體身分。

調查工作
————

消防處人員協助「災難遇害者辨認組」抽走宏建閣、宏泰閣、宏昌閣及宏盛閣升降機槽內積水，以便進行搜查工作。

規管巡查
————

房屋署統籌的緊急維修承建商今日已大致完成清理宏福苑樓宇外圍雜物的工作。四個居屋屋苑（深水埗怡安閣、觀塘安基苑、沙田穗禾苑、深水埗清麗苑）和一個租置屋邨（柴灣峰華邨）完成拆除棚網後，房屋局獨立審查組（審查組）要求註冊檢驗人員安排承建商檢查棚架狀況、清除廢料及雜物，以確保現場環境安全。審查組會繼續巡查及監察情況。

就屋宇署發出的移除棚網命令，截至今日下午六時，224幢私人樓宇的外牆棚網已經移除，尚有四宗申請延期的個案正在進行工程，屋宇署已接受其延期申請，預計可於本周內完成。其餘兩幢私人樓宇，由於承建商與法團存在已久的合約糾紛一直未能解決（糾紛在大埔火災前已出現），影響了移除棚網的工作，屋宇署已安排政府承建商先進行所需工程，日後追回費用。此外，建築署已在限期前完成移除轄下政府建築物的棚網。

屋宇署爭取本星期內公布一套新的安排，要求工地使用的棚網在上架前就地採樣及核實是否符合標準，以便有關外牆工程可盡早恢復。

建造業議會為受暫停外牆工程影響的工人（工種包括水喉、窗框、髹漆及裝飾工、泥水，以及竹棚架）而預留的5 000個「一專多能／技術提升」培訓名額，明日（十二月八日）開始接受報名。課程免費，按不同工種的培訓課程及時數，工人完成訓練並考取資格，可獲津貼最多14,000元至19,000元不等。

勞工處繼續巡查設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工程工地的防火設施及火災應變安排，以保障工人的職業安全。截至今日下午四時，勞工處已巡查332個建築地盤，共發出170份書面警告及95張敦促改善通知書，並提出25宗檢控。"

CFS urges public not to consume a batch of imported canned shredded pork and preserved vegetable found with possibly excessive Sulfamethazine,2025-12-07 19:35,2025-12-07 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700659.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (December 7) urged the public not to consume a batch of imported canned shredded pork and preserved vegetable, as the product was found to possibly contain an excessive amount of Sulfamethazine, a veterinary drug residue. The trade should stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it.

  Product details are as follows:

Product name: Ma Ling Shredded Pork and Preserved Vegetable
Brand: Ma Ling
Place of origin: China
Net weight: 240 grams
Best-before date: April 7, 2028
Distributor: Champion Fair Limited

  A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS noted a notification from the Macao authority that the above-mentioned product was detected with an excessive amount of Sulfamethazine. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed up. A preliminary investigation found that the above-mentioned distributor had imported into Hong Kong the affected batch of the product concerned.""

  The distributor concerned has stopped sales, removed from shelves the affected batch of the product, and initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Members of the public may call the distributor's hotline at 2766 0128 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

  ""Sulfamethazine is a sulfonamide antimicrobial drug. According to the detected level of the veterinary drug residue found by the relevant authority in the sample concerned, occasional consumption will not cause adverse health effect. However, consumption on a long-term basis may cause hypersensitivity and damage to the urinary system,"" the spokesman added.

  The spokesman urged members of the public who had bought the affected batch of the product to stop consuming it. The trade should also stop using or selling the product concerned immediately.

  The CFS has alerted the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. An investigation is ongoing."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-07 18:15,2025-12-07 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700585.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 7), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 78 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 10 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  As some confirmed CF cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. The CHP continued to urge individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which was set up earlier. The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. In late November, the CHP also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department and Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

   Meanwhile, regarding the recently announced local case involving a 23-year-old female living in Sheung Wan, the epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

  The CHP continued to urge the members of the public residing and working at Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. CHP officers continued to reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind individuals to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 2 700 individuals residing or working in the district through the health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre, its enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past two days. Two individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests. One of them tested negative for the chikungunya virus, and the result for the other individual is pending.

  Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-07 18:15,2025-12-07 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/07/P2025120700583.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月七日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得78宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，10宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

鑑於近期部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。中心繼續呼籲近期曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。熱線會繼續由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心在上月底亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

另外，就日前公布的一宗本地個案（涉及一名居於上環的23歲女子），流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

中心繼續呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會繼續接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過於上環文娛中心正門入口處設立的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於上述受影響地區進行上門探訪，為逾2 700名在當區工作或居住的市民進行評估，而過去兩日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為兩名早前出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，其中一人的樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性，另一人的樣本正等候結果。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
