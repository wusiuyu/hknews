問題：

據報，近年飼養寵物的家庭數目上升，寵物相關產業迅速發展。然而，有意見指出，本港在寵物醫療、寵物友善公共設施，以及寵物產業的數據管理及政策方面仍有進一步優化空間。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於據悉，不少私營商場已設立寵物通道及休憩區等人寵共融設施，以吸引寵物主人消費，從而進一步釋放寵物經濟潛力，香港房屋委員會會否參考有關經驗，在其轄下公共屋邨商場推行寵物友善措施；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於據報，台灣桃園市、新北市等地陸續設立公立或公益性質的寵物醫療機構，並提供收費透明的基本寵物醫療服務，不僅提升寵物的健康保障，亦推動寵物經濟，特區政府有否就設立公營或半公營寵物醫療設施展開研究或政策規劃；如有，詳情如何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，備存寵物數據有助掌握寵物疫病風險，以及寵物產業的市場結構及潛力，政府會否設立全港性寵物數據管理平台，有系統地收集相關資訊（包括寵物數量、品種分布、飼養及疫苗接種紀錄，以及寵物疾病趨勢等），以為制訂寵物友善及發展寵物經濟政策提供科學依據；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳仲尼議員的提問，經諮詢房屋局，現回覆如下：

（一）隨着飼養寵物在本港越趨普遍，社會就攜帶動物進入不同場所和使用公共設施的關注亦日益增加。一般而言，政府在檢視是否進一步放寬現行安排時，需要考慮不同因素，包括個別設施的性質、配套是否到位、社會的接受程度等，以達致促進市民與動物和諧共處的政策目標。

香港房屋委員會（房委會）轄下商場主要為「鄰里商場」，設於公共屋邨／屋苑內，為當區居民提供購物便利，以照顧和配合居民日常生活的基本需要。一直以來，陪同視障人士的導盲犬在領路時可以進入房委會的商場。房委會亦已進一步推行一些寵物友善政策，例如若寵物被置於寵物袋或寵物手推車內而不構成任何衞生和環境滋擾，便可以進入商場。房委會會留意社會對寵物友善空間等設施的發展和需要，提供符合實際情況的「鄰里商場」設計。

另一方面，房委會位於油塘的大本型，屬大型區域商場，其室內空間寬敞、設有露天活動區域，以及有寬闊通道和多個位於不同位置的出入口，相比一般位於屋邨的「鄰里商場」更具條件發展為寵物友善商場。房委會會檢視是否適合在大本型進一步提供寵物友善措施，例如設置相關的人寵共融設施，以吸引飼養寵物人士前往消費和帶旺人流。

（二）漁農自然護理署（漁護署）透過公眾宣傳和教育，提醒市民在飼養寵物前必須謹慎思量，評估是否能履行飼養責任，滿足寵物在食物、住所和日常護理，以及醫療等方面的基本需求。

獸醫服務方面，根據《獸醫註冊條例》（第529章）成立的香港獸醫管理局（管理局）現時負責獸醫的規管、註冊和紀律監管，確保本港獸醫護理服務維持於高水平。管理局透過規管獸醫而收集的資料，了解獸醫服務的整體情況。自二○一五年起，註冊的獸醫數目持續上升，由二○一五年的823名註冊獸醫增加至今年四月的1 364名註冊獸醫，升幅達65%。註冊獸醫涵蓋眾多專科資格，例如小型動物的內外科、皮膚科、心臟科、腦神經科、獸醫病理學等，因此動物主人應能為其寵物找到合適的獸醫服務。市民亦可按需要購買市面上的寵物保險產品，以應對突發的醫療開支。

除私人獸醫外，香港城市大學和一些動物福利組織（如香港愛護動物協會）亦有提供獸醫服務，故此政府沒有計劃再另外設立公營寵物醫療設施。

（三）為保障公共衞生和預防動物疾病傳播，漁護署按照法例監察和規管動物活動，並評估寵物疫病風險。漁護署根據《公眾衞生（動物及禽鳥）規例》（第139A章）和《狂犬病規例》（第421A章）採用許可證制度規管活生動物進口，以預防動物疾病傳入香港。另外，漁護署透過不同牌照監管本地的動物活動，例如根據《公眾衞生（動物及禽鳥）（售賣及繁育）規例》（第139B章）下的動物售賣商牌照和繁育狗隻牌照規管出售動物及繁育狗隻活動，以及根據《狂犬病規例》要求狗隻畜養人為狗隻接種狂犬病疫苗、植入晶片和申請狗隻牌照，以預防狂犬病。

政府最近一次在二○一八年就全港住戶飼養寵物進行主題性統計調查。漁護署和政府統計處會在今年下旬再次進行統計調查，以收集香港家庭飼養寵物的趨勢和偏好的最新數據。調查結果亦有助業界了解飼養寵物的最新趨勢，讓其按市場需求提供產品和服務。"
LCQ15: Development of pet-related industries,2025-06-11 12:15,2025-06-11 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100333.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Rock Chen and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

It has been reported that the number of households keeping pets has increased in recent years, with pet-related industries developing rapidly. However, there are views pointing out that Hong Kong still has room for improvement in veterinary medical care and pet-friendly public facilities, as well as in data management and policies regarding the pet industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that a number of private shopping centres have introduced pet-inclusive facilities, such as pet accesses and pet rest areas, to attract spending from pet owners and thereby further unleash the potential of the pet economy, whether the Hong Kong Housing Authority will consider drawing on the relevant experience to implement pet-friendly measures in the shopping centres of the public housing estates under its purview; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it has been reported that public or charity-run veterinary organisations have been established one after another in Taiwan, such as in Taoyuan City and New Taipei City, to provide basic veterinary medical services at transparent charges, which not only enhance pet health protection but also boost the pet economy, whether the HKSAR Government has conducted studies or policy planning regarding the establishment of public or semi-public veterinary medical facilities; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that maintaining pet-related data can help understand the risks of pet epidemics and diseases, as well as the market structure and potential of the pet industry, whether the Government will establish a territory-wide pet data management platform to systematically collect relevant data, including the number of pets, breed distribution, keeping and vaccination records, and pet disease trends, so as to provide a scientific basis for the formulation of policies on pet-friendliness and developing the pet economy policies; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the Housing Bureau, the reply to the question from the Hon Rock Chen is as follows:

(1) As pet keeping has become increasingly common in Hong Kong, there has been more attention in society to bringing animals to enter different premises and use public facilities. In general, the Government needs to take into account different factors when considering whether to further relax existing arrangements, including the nature of individual facilities, whether ancillary facilities are in place and the degree of social acceptance, in order to achieve the policy objective of facilitating people and animals to co-exist harmoniously.

The shopping centres under the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) are mainly ""neighbourhood shopping centres"" located in public housing estates/courts. These shopping centres provide local residents with shopping convenience, with the aim of catering for their basic needs in daily life. All along, guide dogs accompanying the visually impaired have been allowed to enter the HA's shopping centres. The HA has further implemented some pet-friendly policies, such as allowing pets to enter shopping centres if they are placed in pet carrier bags or pet strollers and that no hygiene and environmental nuisance will be caused. The HA will keep in view the development and needs of the community for pet-friendly spaces and facilities, and design ""neighbourhood shopping centres"" that are in line with the actual situation.

On the other hand, the Domain located in Yau Tong is a large-scale regional shopping centre under the HA. Coupled with spacious indoor space, outdoor activity areas, wide passageways and multiple entrances at different locations, it is more equipped with the requisites for development into a pet-friendly mall than typical ""neighbourhood shopping centres"" located in housing estates. The HA will review whether it is appropriate to further provide pet-friendly measures in the Domain, such as installing relevant human-pet friendly facilities to appeal to pet owners for boosting consumption and visitor flow.

(2) The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has been carrying out publicity and public education to remind the public to consider carefully before deciding to keep pets, to assess whether one could fulfil the duties of pet ownership in meeting the pets' basic needs in diet, environment, daily care, healthcare, etc.

On veterinary services, the Veterinary Surgeons Board of Hong Kong (VSB) established under the Veterinary Surgeons Registration Ordinance (Cap. 529), is currently responsible for the regulation, registration and disciplinary control of veterinary surgeons, so as to ensure a high standard of veterinary services in Hong Kong. The VSB learns about the overall veterinary services through data gathered in the regulation of the veterinary profession. The number of registered veterinary surgeons (RVS) has been consistently on the rise since 2015, from 823 in 2015 to 1 364 in April this year, representing an increase of 65 per cent. RVS comprises many specialties, such as small animal internal medicine and surgery, dermatology, cardiology, neurology and veterinary pathology, and therefore animal owners should be able to find appropriate veterinary services for their pets. To meet unexpected medical expenses, members of the public may also purchase pet insurance products available in the market as appropriate.

Apart from private veterinarians, the City University of Hong Kong and some animal welfare organisations (such as the Hong Kong Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) also provide veterinary services and hence the Government currently has no plan to separately establish public medical facilities for pets.

(3) To safeguard public health and prevent the spread of animal diseases, the AFCD monitors and regulates animal activities in accordance with the law, and assesses the risk of pet animal diseases. The AFCD regulates the import of live animals through a permit system under the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations (Cap. 139A) and the Rabies Regulation (Cap. 421A), so as to prevent the introduction of animal diseases into Hong Kong. Furthermore, the AFCD regulates the local animal activities through various licences, for example, regulating the animal trading and dog breeding activities through the Animal Trader Licence and Dog Breeder Licence respectively under the Public Health (Animals and Birds) (Trading and Breeding) Regulations (Cap. 139B), and to require dog keepers to have their dogs vaccinated against rabies, implanted with a microchip, and to apply for a dog licence under the Rabies Regulation, for the prevention of rabies.

The Government last conducted a Thematic Household Survey on pet ownership among households across Hong Kong in 2018. The AFCD and the Census and Statistics Department will conduct another survey later this year to gather the latest data on trends and preferences in pet ownership of Hong Kong families. These findings will assist the trade to learn about the latest trend of pet ownership, for their provision of products and services according to market demand."
立法會十三題：園林廢物的處理,2025-06-11 12:08,2025-06-11 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100321.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上林筱魯議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

環境保護署（環保署）於二○二一年設立園林廢物回收中心Y·‍PARK［林·區］，目的是將回收的園林廢物轉化為有用物料，減少堆填區廢棄物及相關碳排放，其首年目標處理量約11 000公噸，隨後會逐步增至平均每年約22 000公噸。然而，政府資料顯示，其去年處理量為6 876公噸。此外，據報早前有貨車從Y·PARK［林·區］駛出，並將車上園林廢物運往新界西堆填區棄置，環保署其後解釋有關園林廢物因混雜大量雜物而未能接收。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）Y·PARK［林·區］回收園林廢物的標準為何；有否研究，近年Y·PARK［林·區］處理園林廢物數量逐步下降的原因為何，包括有否受其回收標準及園林廢物生產者自行回收再造的情況所影響；

（二）鑑於據悉，Y·PARK［林·區］的園林廢物主要來自（i）‍建築工程及（ii）日常植物保養的清理工作，有否統計二○二一年至今Y·PARK［林·區］處理（i）及（ii）的園林廢物數量分別為何；過去三年，曾運往Y·PARK［林·區］而被拒處理的園林廢物的數量為何，以及有否調查該等園林廢物的最後處理方式（例如轉化為生物炭及運往堆填區）；

（三）鑑於根據政府於二○二三年一月提交本會研究與都市固體廢物收費、回收及循環再造相關的政策事宜小組委員會的文件，位於環保園的生物炭試驗設施會將Y·‍PARK［林·區］的再造產品進一步轉化成生物炭，估計每年可處理約6 000公噸的本地木質廢料及生產約1 200公噸生物炭，自該設施運作至今，其廢料處理量及生物炭生產量為何，以及是否達標；如否，預計何時達標；及

（四）鑑於根據《香港固體廢物監察報告》，二○二三年本港園林廢物回收量為10 400公噸，而棄置量為約83 000公噸，而同年Y·PARK［林·區］的園林廢物處理量為8 609公噸，有否評估Y·PARK［林·區］的園林廢物處理量是否有改善空間；政府有否進一步的策略提升園林廢物的回收率？

答覆：

主席：

自超強颱風山竹吹襲香港後，環境保護署（環保署）在二○二一年設立臨時園林廢物回收中心Y·PARK［林‧區］，一方面收集和處理日常植物保養的清理工作和工務工程所產生的園林廢物，另一方面協助處理超強颱風等緊急事故後所產生的大量園林廢物。環保署繳付承辦商的服務費用並非以收集的園林廢物量計算，而是按照承辦商所生產的再生產品量計算，可以更準確反映Y·PARK的工作成效。

就林筱魯議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）為確保Y·PARK運作暢順和再生產品的質素，Y·PARK訂定合適的園林廢物回收標準，包括不接收受感染或被蟲蛀的木頭、難以處理的廢木如樹樁、純嫩枝、樹葉、草屑或混雜大量雜質的園林廢物。若園林廢物混雜大量雜質，有機會嚴重影響碎木的工作，例如Y·PARK的破碎機曾因為木頭內藏有鐵枝而引致機件故障，需耗費時間和人力去除鐵枝、更換零件和維修設備，甚至會導致生產線停止運作。同時，所生產的再生產品質素亦有可能因攙雜雜質而受到影響，例如，若再生產品中混入了塑膠便會限制其在園藝種植的應用。為此，Y·PARK承辦商與園林廢物產生者保持溝通，講解如何從源頭做好分類工作，以減少Y·PARK需拒收園林廢物的情況。

Y·PARK其中一個功能是協助處理超強颱風後短時間內所產生的大量園林廢物，因此在Y·PARK於二○二一年成立之初，我們要求承辦商具備足夠緩衝處理能力，首年須具備最高每日30公噸的處理量（即每年約為11 000公噸），而隨後逐步增加至每日60公噸（即每年約為22 000公噸）。然而，Y·PARK的實際園林廢物收集量受多項因素所影響，例如每年風季的颱風數目和強度、政府和私人地盤平整工程的運作和進度，以及園林廢物的質量。

（二）由二○二一年開始運作以來，截至今年四月，Y·PARK共接收約31 540公噸園林廢物，當中超過五成來自建築工程和約四成來自日常植物保養工作。環保署並未有備存被拒收的園林廢物數量記錄以及其最後處理方式的資料。

（三）環保署設立的本港首座生物炭生產試驗設施（試驗設施）原定計劃是二○二三年十一月正式投產，每年處理約6 000公噸的本地木質廢料及生產約1 200公噸生物炭為試驗設施的預計處理能力。試驗設施由二○二三年五月開始進行測試運作，期間克服了不少技術問題，以及就不同運作條件（包括處理溫度、停留時間和不同的木質原材料）進行調試，以找出最佳的運作條件，確保能以較低的能源消耗量製造出高品質的生物碳，試驗設施最終於二○二四年十月正式投產。試驗設施自進行測試運作至二○二五年四月底，已處理超過1 200公噸的本地木質廢料，轉化成超過270公噸的生物炭。試驗設施的設立是為了測試使用本地木質廢料轉化成生物炭的技術可行性，以及研究提升生物炭的質量和在本地市場的應用成效。因此，試驗設施的實際處理量會隨着測試需要而調節，亦會受到的木質廢料的供應及本地市場對生物碳的應用需求等影響。試驗設施投產只有約半年時間，環保署會總結運作經驗，以確立技術要求和市場應用後，逐步提升設施的處理量。

（四）為進一步改善Y·PARK的園林廢物處理量，環保署會多管齊下以提升園林廢物的回收率，包括：（一）環保署會持續與相關政府部門及其他園林廢物生產者保持溝通，鼓勵他們根據減少、重用和循環再造的原則，盡量把園林廢物在原地處理和循環再用，而未能原地處理或循環再用的園林廢物，可送往Y·PARK或其他合適的回收設施處理；（二）為鼓勵Y·PARK承辦商盡量將收集到的園林廢物循環再造以提升其回收率，現時合約訂明環保署繳付承辦商的服務費用是按其所生產的再生產品量計算，確保承辦商有經濟誘因；及（三）長遠而言，政府會於新界北新市鎮預留土地發展更具規模的園林廢物回收設施，以提升園林廢物處理能力。"
LCQ13: Disposal of yard waste,2025-06-11 12:08,2025-06-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100322.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Andrew Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) set up Y·PARK, a yard waste recycling centre, in 2021, with the purpose of converting recycled yard waste into useful materials to reduce disposal at landfills and associated carbon emissions. Y·PARK has a target handling capacity of about 11 000 tonnes in the first year, which would gradually increase to an annual average of around 22 000 tonnes. However, information from the Government shows that Y·PARK's throughput last year was 6 876 tonnes. Besides, earlier on some trucks were reportedly driven from Y·PARK carrying yard waste to landfills in the New Territories West for disposal, and the EPD subsequently explained that the yard waste in question was not acceptable as it contained a large amount of impurities. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of Y·PARK's criteria for the recovery of yard waste, whether it has studied the reasons for the gradual decline in the amount of yard waste handled by Y·PARK in recent years, including whether this is affected by Y·PARK's recovery criteria or the fact that yard waste producers recycle their own waste;

(2) as it is learnt that Y·PARK's major sources of yard waste are (i) ‍construction works and (ii) clearance work arising from regular vegetation maintenance, whether there is a statistical breakdown of the amount of yard waste respectively from (i) and (ii) handled by Y·PARK from 2021 to date; of the amount of yard waste that was sent to but not accepted at Y·PARK over the past three years, and whether it has looked into how such yard waste was subsequently disposed of (such as conversion into biochar and being sent to landfills);

(3) given that according to a paper submitted by the Government to the Subcommittee to Study Policy Issues Relating to Municipal Solid Waste Charging, Recovery and Recycling of this Council in January 2023, a pilot biochar plant in EcoPark, which will further convert recyclable products of Y·PARK into biochar, has an estimated capability of converting about 6 000 tonnes of local woody waste into some 1 200 tonnes of biochar annually, of the amounts of waste handled and biochar produced since the plant came into operation, and whether such amounts could meet the targets; if not, when they are expected to meet the targets; and

(4) given that according to the report on Monitoring of Solid Waste in Hong Kong, the amounts of yard waste recovered and disposed in Hong Kong in 2023 were 10 400 tonnes and some 83 000 tonnes respectively, while the amount of yard waste handled by Y·PARK in the same year was 8 609 tonnes, whether it has assessed if there is room for improvement in Y·PARK's handling capacity; whether the Government has further strategies in place to enhance the recovery rate of yard waste?

Reply:

President,

After the onslaught of Super Typhoon Mangkhut, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) set up a temporary yard waste recycling centre, Y·PARK, in 2021 to collect and process yard waste generated from regular vegetation maintenance and public construction works on one hand, and to assist in treating large quantities of yard waste generated after emergency incidents such as super typhoons on the other. The service fees paid by the EPD to the contractor are not based on the amount of yard waste received, but on the quantity of recyclable products produced by the contractor, which reflects Y·PARK's performance more accurately.

The reply to the question raised by the Hon Andrew Lam is as follows:

(1)To ensure the smooth operation of Y·PARK and the quality of the recyclable products, Y·PARK has established appropriate standards for yard waste recycling, including not accepting infected or infested wood, yard waste which is difficult to process such as tree stumps, pure twigs, leaves, grass clippings, or yard waste containing large amount of impurities. If yard waste is mixed with large amount of impurities, the chipping operations may be severely affected. For instance, Y·PARK's wood chipper experienced mechanical failures due to metal rods hidden in the wood. Time and manpower were required to remove the rods, replace parts and repair the equipment. Such incidents could even halt the production line. Meanwhile, the quality of the recyclable products produced may be affected by impurities. For instance, plastics mixed into the recyclable products would limit their use in gardening. In this regard, the contractor of Y·PARK maintains communication with yard waste producers to explain how to properly separate waste at source to reduce instances where Y·PARK has to reject yard waste.

One of the Y·PARK's functions is to assist in handling the large amount of yard waste generated in a short period of time after super typhoons. Therefore, when Y·PARK was set up in 2021, we required the contractor to have sufficient handling capacity as buffer of up to 30 tonnes per day (i.e. about 11 000 tonnes per year) in the first year and to gradually increase to 60 tonnes per day (i.e. about 22 000 tonnes per year) subsequently. Yet the actual amount of yard waste received at Y·PARK is subject to various factors such as the number and intensity of typhoons during the typhoon season each year, the operations and progress of government and private site formation projects, and the quality of the yard waste.

(2) Since its commencement of operation in 2021 up to April this year, Y·PARK has received a total of approximately 31 540 tonnes of yard waste, of which more than 50 per cent from construction works and about 40 per cent from routine vegetation maintenance. The EPD does not have the quantity of rejected yard waste and information on its final disposal means.

(3) The first Pilot Biochar Production Plant (PBPP) in Hong Kong established by the EPD was originally scheduled to commence production in November 2023, with an estimated handling capacity of processing about 6 000 tonnes of local wood materials and producing about 1 200 tonnes of biochar annually. The PBPP commenced its testing in May 2023, during which many technical issues were overcome and various operational conditions (including processing temperatures, duration, and different types of wood-based raw materials) were adjusted and tested, in order to identify the optimal operating conditions and ensure high-quality biochar can be produced with less energy consumption. The PBPP finally commenced production in October 2024. From the start of the PBPP's testing stage to the end of April 2025, the PBPP has processed over 1 200 tonnes of local wood materials from yard waste, converting them into more than 270 tonnes of biochar. The purposes of setting up the PBPP are to explore the technical feasibility of converting local wood materials from yard waste into biochar, as well as to study the quality of the biochar produced and its practical applications in the local market. As such, the actual processing quantity of the PBPP is adjusted based on testing needs and is also affected by the supply of wood materials and local market demand for biochar applications. With the PBPP entering production stage for only about six months, the EPD will consolidate operational experiences with a view to gradually increasing its processing quantity upon establishing technical requirements and market applications.

(4) In order to further enhance the yard waste processing quantity of Y·PARK, the EPD are adopting a multi-pronged approach to increase the yard waste recycling rate. Measures include: (i) the EPD will continue to liaise with relevant government departments and other yard waste producers, encouraging them to adhere to the principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle, and treat and reuse yard waste on-site as far as possible, while yard waste that cannot be treated or reused on-site could be delivered to Y·PARK or other suitable recycling facilities for treatment; (ii) to encourage the Y·PARK contractor to recycle collected yard waste as far as possible to increase its recycling rate. The current contract stipulates that the service fees paid by the EPD to the contractor are based on the quantity of recyclable products produced, providing a financial incentive to the contractor; and (iii) in the long run, the Government reserves land in the New Territories North New Town to establish a larger-scale yard waste recycling facility to enhance yard waste handling capacity."
立法會八題：公共單車泊位,2025-06-11 11:45,2025-06-11 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100275.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上李世榮議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有市民認為，政府應採取措施以確保新界區的公共單車泊位獲善用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）截至去年底，政府於新界東南區（按立法會選舉地方選區劃分）一共提供了多少個公眾單車泊位，以及負責管理該等泊位的政府部門及泊位所佔的總面積為為何；

（二）鑑於現時法例規定單車不得在泊車處連續停泊超過24小時，政府部門針對公共單車泊位的超時停泊單車的跟進機制（包括跟進行動的頻率及處理方法）為何；政府有否檢討現行公共單車泊位的管理安排；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）針對長期停泊、無人認領或被遺棄於公共單車泊位的單車，政府所採取的跨部門聯合行動的具體程序（包括涉及的政府部門及行動頻率）為何；過去三年，該等聯合行動的次數、所處理的單車數目及行動支出為何；有否評估該等行動的成效，以及有關的評估標準為何；

（四）過去三年，政府收到多少宗關於新界東南區公共單車泊位被長期佔用或用以堆放非單車物品的投訴，以及政府就該等個案所採取措施的詳情為何，包括涉及執法部門的具體分工及協作機制，以及有否備存就該等個案所引致的市容及衞生問題的跟進紀錄；及

（五）政府有否考慮以新界東南區作試點，以用者自付模式提供月租或時租的有蓋「智能單車泊位」（例如設有防盜、監控、電子鎖和感應器等裝置），並參考其他地區的智能泊位管理經驗，研究適合方案以優化本港的公共單車泊位管理；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府的政策是在道路安全及環境許可的前提下推動「單車友善」環境，在新發展區及新市鎮加設單車徑及相關設施，並改善現有設施（包括單車停泊設施），以方便市民騎單車作為康樂或短途代步用途，減少使用機動交通工具。就李世榮議員的提問，經諮詢各相關部門，現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二四年底，政府在新界東南立法會選區內，管理及提供約10 000個公眾單車泊位，佔地總面積約為11 000平方米。上述泊位一般由運輸署、房屋署、食物環境衞生署（食環署）和康樂及文化事務署管理。

（二）及（三）根據《道路交通（泊車）規例》（第374C章），在設有街燈的公共道路上，只可在指定單車泊車處停泊單車。任何人在單車泊車處連續停泊單車超過24小時，即屬犯罪，可處第1級罰款（現時為2,000元）。

現時各相關部門包括分區民政事務處、分區地政處、運輸署、警務處和食環署等，會按實際情況和需要適時採取聯合行動，清理違例停泊或棄置的單車。過去三年（即由二○二二年至二○二四年），相關部門共採取331次聯合行動，移除超過20 000輛違例停泊在公共單車泊位的單車。聯合行動次數逐年增長，而每次行動中平均清理的單車數目稍為下降，反映執法力度和阻嚇性均有提升。有關分項數字如下：

相關部門根據既定程序和法例賦予的權力進行聯合行動和執管工作。具體而言，運輸署及警務處會於聯合行動前最少14日，分別發出及張貼有關單車停泊處暫停使用的通告。由於有關地點於暫停使用期間不再屬於公眾單車泊位，在該處停泊單車可被視作非法佔用政府土地。在單車停泊處開始暫停使用當日（一般為聯合行動前兩日），警務處會遮蔽單車停泊處標誌並封閉該處。當區地政處會按照《土地（雜項條文）條例》（第28章）於行動範圍內每一輛當時仍停泊於該處的單車上張貼通知，並於適當地方張貼通告，勒令有關人士須於指定日期（即清理行動當日）前移走單車，否則相關單車會被移除。聯合行動當日，食環署會協助移除已予張貼通知但仍停放於該處的單車，並交由當區地政處接管及處置，相關人士不能贖回。有關單車停泊處會於行動後重新開放予公眾使用。
​
聯合行動的開支由各部門的整體資源承擔，未有分開計算。

（四）過去三年，就新界東南區內單車泊位，地政總署接獲於西貢區和沙田區違泊單車的投訴個案數目分別為292宗和1 572宗；而食環署並沒有接獲轄下管理範圍內的公眾單車泊位被鎖上或堆放非單車物品的投訴個案。如上文所述，政府已於過去三年進行超過300次聯合行動；另外，食環署若發現在公眾單車泊位有垃圾堆積，會即時安排承辦商清掃。

（五）政府一直致力推動智慧城市的發展，並已在多個領域引入智能技術以提升服務質素和市民生活便利性。經過政府的推動和配合，近年開始有私人發展項目引入了「智能單車泊位」系統，亦有一些私人發展項目透過在室內提供單車泊位提升管理質素。政府目前正研究將單車泊位納入為土地用途的附屬設施，要求新發展項目按其土地用途及規模，配備足夠單車泊位，相關設施會與其他用地附屬設施一樣，由該用地發展商或負責人管理和維護，以提升設施質量，進一步推動「單車友善」環境。就公眾單車停泊處方面，考慮到「智能單車泊位」涉及較高建設及維護成本，政府現階段會使用設計更為有效和易用的設施，例如雙層單車泊架，並優先投放更多資源於更迫切的交通基建項目。與此同時，我們會繼續留意「智能單車泊位」技術的發展，適時評估其在本港公共單車停泊處的適用性。"
立法會七題：使用色粉作渠管檢測,2025-06-11 11:45,2025-06-11 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100307.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上何俊賢議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

據報，本年二月十五日，屯門河水呈現大面積紅色，引起市民恐慌。經政府初步調查，懷疑有人使用紅色色粉作渠管檢測。雖然政府調查人員到場時河水已回復正常及沒有發現魚類死亡，而當日抽取的水樣本也顯示水質指數正常，但據悉類似事件也曾於二○二三年八月及二○二二年十一月分別在大埔林村河和大圍城門河發生，引起社會廣泛關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，上述類似事件的宗數為何，以及每宗事件的調查工作所涉及的政府部門、平均所涉人手、調查時間及涉及的公帑開支為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，雖然化驗結果顯示上述事件暫未對環境、水質及魚類造成影響，但事件仍對公眾造成恐慌，政府會否採取進一步行動跟進事件，以加強對公眾的保障；及

（三）現時政府有否就使用色粉作渠管檢測制訂詳細指引；如有，詳情為何，包括不遵從相關指引會否構成任何罪行或罰則；如否，會否考慮制訂指引，並完善相關通報機制，以免發生事故時引起公眾誤會或恐慌？

答覆：

主席：

就何俊賢議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）過去五年，環境保護署（環保署）共接獲21宗涉及色粉測試的查詢個案。在收到相關投訴後，環保署會盡快派員到現場進行調查，包括量度水中的溶解氧含量和酸鹼值，以及抽取水樣本作進一步化驗，以確定水體變色原因和是否受到污染。環保署亦會檢視附近有否魚類死亡或其他不尋常的情況，沿雨水渠追蹤污染源頭。視乎個別情況，渠務署也會協助追蹤調查，若發現有非法排放污水的情況，環保署會依法採取相應執法行動。有關調查水體變色是環保署綜合執法工作的一部分，調查的時間亦因應個別個案的位置和範圍而有所不同，因此並沒有相關公帑開支的分項數據。

為加強對公眾的保障，環保署會在調查有初步結果時盡快回覆投訴人和傳媒的查詢，以提高資訊透明度和釋除公眾疑慮。視乎個別情況，環保署更會在抽取水樣本翌日，再次到達現場視察情況有否發生變化，而需要作進一步的跟進。

（三）使用色粉測試是檢查污水渠有否錯誤接駁至雨水渠或滲漏的有效辦法。環保署人員進行測試檢查污水渠錯駁問題時，會盡量使用最少的染色劑量，以減低對附近河流及海灣的影響。

在業界和私人樓宇及屋苑方面，環保署、屋宇署和食物環境衞生署（食環署）已分別就使用色粉作渠管檢測制定了相關指引（可在環保署、屋宇署和食環署的網站下載），亦會透過宣傳及教育，提醒業界如物業管理公司、建築商等，使用色粉測試劑所須注意的事項和防污措施，例如檢測時須嚴格遵守色粉測試劑生產商的建議、安排人員監督、盡早通知檢測地點的物業管理公司及附近一帶的居民，以免引起公眾疑慮。上述指引屬於行政措施，但我們必須強調，色粉為可分解物質及沒有毒性，並且沒有影響水質，因此進行色粉測試沒有違反《水污染管制條例》（第358章）。

通報機制方面，我們理解色粉測試或會引起公眾誤會，所以渠務署會在進行定期色粉檢測前，在其網頁發放通知，讓市民知悉有關色粉測試的安排。這些定期測試目的是確保污水處理廠的海底排放管無損，而由於為海底排放管進行色粉測試需要用的染色劑量較多而且範圍較大，較易引起市民關注。

環保署則因應投訴和個案的特別情況，需要不時使用色粉測試以檢查污水渠錯駁問題或進行執法，但這些情況使用的染色劑量及影響範圍較少，一般都不會造成影響。"
LCQ8: Public bicycle parking spaces,2025-06-11 11:45,2025-06-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100290.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

Some members of the public are of the view that the Government should take measures to ensure that public bicycle parking spaces in the New Territories are put to good use. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the total number of public bicycle parking spaces provided by the Government in the New Territories South East (broken down by Legislative Council election geographical constituency) as at the end of last year, as well as the government departments responsible for the management of such parking spaces and the total area occupied by such parking spaces;

(2) as it is stipulated in the existing legislation that no bicycle shall be parked in a parking place for a continuous period of more than 24 ‍hours, of the follow-up mechanism adopted by government departments against bicycles parked overtime at public bicycle parking spaces (including the frequency of follow-up actions and the ways to handle such bicycles); whether the Government has reviewed the existing arrangements for the management of public bicycle parking spaces; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) of the specific procedures of the inter-departmental joint operations taken by the Government against bicycles which have been parked for a long period of time, or which are unclaimed or abandoned at public bicycle parking spaces (including the government departments involved and the frequency of such operations); the number of such joint operations, the number of bicycles handled and the expenditure incurred for such operations in the past three years; whether it had assessed the effectiveness of such operations, and of the relevant assessment standards;

(4) of the number of complaints received by the Government in the past three years about public bicycle parking spaces in the New Territories South East being occupied for a long period of time or being used for stacking non-cycling articles, as well as the details of the measures taken by the Government in respect of such cases, including the specific division of work and collaborative mechanism among the law enforcement departments involved, and whether it has kept follow-up records in respect of the cityscape and hygiene problems arising from such cases; and

(5) whether the Government has considered using the New Territories South East as a pilot district to provide covered ""smart bicycle parking spaces"" (e.g. those equipped with anti-theft devices, surveillance devices, electronic locks and sensors, etc) on a monthly or hourly basis under the user pays mode, and making reference to the experience of other regions in the management of smart parking spaces to explore suitable options to enhance the management of public bicycle parking spaces in Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

It is the Government's policy to foster a ""bicycle-friendly"" environment where road safety considerations and circumstances permit by adding cycling tracks and related facilities in new development areas and new towns as well as improving existing facilities (including bicycle parking facilities), with a view to facilitating the public use of bicycles for recreational or short-distance commuting purposes, thereby reducing the use of mechanised transport. In response to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Li, our reply in consultation with the related departments is provided as follows:

(1) As of the end of 2024, the Government is managing and providing about 10 000 public bicycle parking spaces, with a total area of about 11 000 square meters in the Legislative Council New Territories South East geographical constituency. The aforementioned parking spaces are generally managed by the Transport Department (TD), the Housing Department, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.

(2) and (3) According to the Road Traffic (Parking) Regulations (Cap. 374C), on public roads with street lighting, bicycles can only be parked at a designated bicycle parking place. Any person who parks a bicycle in a bicycle parking place for a continuous period of more than 24 hours commits an offence and is liable to a fine at level 1 (currently $2,000).

At present, related departments (including the District Offices under the Home Affairs Department, the District Lands Offices, the TD, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the FEHD) conduct joint operations as necessary based on actual circumstances and needs to remove illegally parked or abandoned bicycles. In the past three years (from 2022 to 2024), a total of 331 joint operations were conducted by the related departments, with over 20 000 illegally parked bicycles from public bicycle parking spaces being removed. The increase in the number of joint operations year by year and the slight decrease in the average number of bicycles cleared per operation have reflected the improved enforcement strength and the deterrent effect. The relevant breakdown is as follows:




Year
Number of joint operations
Number of bicycles cleared
Average number of bicycles cleared per operation


2022
89
5 969
67


2023
111
7 278
66


2024
131
7 646
58


Total
331
20 893




The joint operations and enforcement actions are conducted by relevant departments in accordance with established procedures and empowered by relevant legislations. More specifically, the TD and the HKPF will issue and post notices respectively regarding the temporary suspension of the relevant bicycle parking spaces at least 14 days prior to the joint operation. Since such areas are no longer designated public bicycle parking space during the suspension period, any bicycle parked there may be regarded as unauthorised occupation of government land. On the effective day of suspension (generally two days before the joint operation), the HKPF will cover the bicycle parking signage and close off the area. The relevant District Lands Office will post statutory notice on each bicycle still present within the operation area under the Land (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 28) and post notices at appropriate places, requiring the persons concerned to remove the bicycles by a specific date (i.e. the day of operation); otherwise the bicycles will be removed. On the day of joint operation, the FEHD will assist in removing the remaining bicycles parked in the area with notices posted, and hand them over to the local District Lands Office for taking over and disposal; the persons concerned cannot get back the bicycles. The bicycle parking spaces will be re-opened for public use after the operation.

The expenditures of joint operations are absorbed by the overall resources of the respective departments, and have not been separately identified.

(4) In the past three years, in respect of bicycle parking spaces in the New Territories South East, the Lands Department has received a total of 292 and 1 572 complaints about illegal bicycle parking in Sai Kung District and Sha Tin District respectively; and the FEHD has not received any complaint regarding the public bicycle parking spaces under FEHD's management being locked or with non-bicycle items piling up. As aforementioned, the Government conducted over 300 joint operations in the past three years; and if the FEHD detects accumulation of refuse in public bicycle parking spaces, immediate cleaning by contractors will be arranged.

(5) The Government has been committed to promoting the development of a smart city and has introduced intelligent technologies in various aspects to enhance service quality and public convenience. With the promotion and co-ordination of the Government, some private development projects have introduced ""smart bicycle parking systems"", while some have improved management quality by offering indoor bicycle parking spaces. The Government is studying to include bicycle parking spaces as ancillary facilities within land uses, requiring new development projects to provide sufficient bicycle parking spaces according to their land use and scale. These facilities, like other ancillary facilities, will be managed and maintained by the land developer or the responsible party to improve the facilities' overall quality and further foster a ""bicycle-friendly"" environment. Regarding public bicycle parking spaces, given the relatively high construction and maintenance costs of ""smart bicycle parking systems"", the Government will utilise facilities that are designed to be more effective and user-friendly, such as double-deck parking racks, and will give priority to allocating resources for more pressing transport infrastructure projects for now. Meanwhile, we will continue to keep in view the technological development of ""smart bicycle parking systems"", and assess their applicability in Hong Kong's public bicycle parking spaces in a timely manner."
LCQ7: Draining pipe testing with dye powder,2025-06-11 11:45,2025-06-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100313.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Steven Ho and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

It has been reported that on February 15 this year, the water of Tuen Mun River turned red extensively, causing panic among members of the public. The Government's initial investigation revealed that there was draining pipe testing with red dye powder. Upon arrival of the Government's investigating officers at the scene, they found that the river water had resumed normal and no fish deaths were found. They collected water samples on the same day for testing and found that the water quality indicators remained normal as well. However, it is learnt that similar incidents also occurred on Lam Tsuen River in Tai Po and Shing Mun River in Tai Wai in August 2023 and November 2022 respectively, which have aroused widespread concern in the community. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of the aforesaid similar incidents in the past five years, as well as the government department(s) involved in the investigation of each incident, the average manpower involved, the time taken for the investigations and the public expenditure involved;

(2) as there are views that although the test results have indicated that the aforesaid incident has not caused impact on the environment, water quality and fish for the time being, the incident has still caused panic among members of the public, whether the Government will take further actions to follow up the incident, so as to enhance protection for the public; and

(3) whether the Government has formulated detailed guidelines on draining pipe testing with dye powder at present; if so, of the details, including whether non-compliance with the relevant guidelines will constitute any offence or attract penalty; if not, whether it will consider formulating the guidelines and enhancing the relevant notification mechanism, so as to avoid causing misunderstanding or panic among members of the public in the event of an incident?

Reply:

President,

The reply to the question raised by the Hon Steven Ho is as follows:

(1) and (2) In the past five years, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) received a total of 21 cases of inquiries related to dye test. Upon receiving relevant complaints, the EPD will promptly dispatch personnel to conduct investigation on site, including measuring the dissolved oxygen content and pH level in the water, as well as collecting water samples for further testing to determine the cause of water coloration and whether pollution has occurred. The EPD will also check in the vicinity of the site concerned for any fish deaths or other unusual circumstances, and trace the source of pollution along the stormwater drains. Depending on individual circumstances, the Drainage Services Department (DSD) may also assist in the tracing investigation. If illegal discharges of wastewater are found, the EPD will take appropriate enforcement actions in accordance with the law. The investigation of water coloration incidents is part of the EPD's integrated enforcement efforts and the duration of investigation may also vary depending on the location and scope of individual case. Therefore, there is no breakdown of the expenditure involved.

To foster protection to the general public, the EPD will respond to inquiries from complainants and the media as soon as there are preliminary results of the investigation, in order to enhance information transparency and alleviate public concerns. Depending on individual circumstances, the EPD may also return to the site the day after collecting water samples to inspect whether there have been any changes and to further follow-up as required.

(3) Conducting dye tests is an effective method to check the sewer systems for misconnections to stormwater drains or leakage. When the EPD personnel conduct tests to examine sewer misconnection issues, they will use the minimum amount of dye possible to reduce the impact on nearby rivers and bays.

For the trades and private buildings, as well as housing estates, the EPD, the Buildings Department (BD), and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) have developed relevant guidelines for dye tests for pipe testing respectively (which can be downloaded from the websites of the EPD, the BD and the FEHD). Through promotion and education, we also remind the trades, including property management companies and building contractors, about the precautions and pollution prevention measures associated with dye tests. These include strictly adhering to the recommendations of the dye manufacturers during testing, arranging for personnel supervision, and notifying the property management company of the testing site and nearby residents in advance to avoid giving rise to public concerns. The above guidelines are administrative measures. However, we must emphasise that the dye used is a biodegradable and non-toxic substance, and does not affect water quality. In this regard, conducting dye test does not violate the Water Pollution Control Ordinance (Cap. 358).

Regarding the notification mechanism, we understand that dye test may lead to public misunderstanding. Therefore, the DSD will issue notifications on its website before conducting regular dye tests to inform the public about the arrangements for these dye tests. The purpose of these regular tests is to ensure the integrity of the submarine outfalls of sewage treatment plants. Since conducting dye tests on submarine outfalls requires a larger amount of dye and involves a wider area, it is more likely to attract public attention.

Based on the complaint and specific circumstances of the case, the EPD occasionally needs to use dye tests to check on sewage misconnection issues or carry out enforcement actions. Yet these circumstances would involve a smaller amount of dye used and a smaller impact area which in general would not cause any impact."
LCQ10: Facilitation measures for cross-boundary goods vehicles,2025-06-11 11:43,2025-06-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100227.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Yim Kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

It has been reported that the Government will announce the details of Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles within this year, and only non-commercial small passenger vehicles will be allowed to apply under the first phase of implementation. Some members of the logistics and transport industries expect the Government to make good use of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and take the opportunity of implementing Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles to enhance the relevant policy on Guangdong/Hong Kong cross-boundary Mainland goods vehicles, so as to further consolidate Hong Kong's role as the prominent hub for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and to drive the development of the Hong Kong International Airport (the airport), container terminals, and the entire logistics industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the Government will, in the course of formulating the policy on Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles, discuss with the Mainland authorities the enhancement of the relevant policy on cross-boundary Mainland goods vehicles (including the quota system coordinated by the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong), so as to facilitate cross-boundary goods vehicles in travelling between the Mainland and Hong Kong; if so, of the details, including the expected time of announcing the relevant policy;

(2) whether the Government will enhance the application process for southbound cross-boundary Mainland goods vehicles or introduce new measures, e.g. making reference to the existing system of ""closed road permits"" while streamlining the application process therein, such that a certain number of Mainland goods vehicles will be allowed to reach designated major cargo hubs in Hong Kong (including the cargo terminals of the airport and container terminals) directly via designated routes; and

(3) whether the Government will make reference to the experience of other places (e.g. the ""Green Card system"" (a kind of cross-border motor insurance card system) in Europe) and promote a mutual recognition mechanism for motor insurance among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, so as to achieve ""one insurance policy for all""?

Reply:

President,

The Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) attaches great importance to the development of modern logistics, and is committed to developing Hong Kong into an international smart logistics hub. To this end, the Government promulgated the Action Plan on Modern Logistics Development in 2023, which proposed to enhance Hong Kong's role as the gateway and key transshipment hub for cargoes to and from the Greater Bay Area (GBA) by improving multimodal transport. In particular, cross-boundary land freight transport is a major mode of freight transport between Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA, as well as an important component of the ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal transport system between Hong Kong and the Mainland. On the other hand, cross-boundary goods vehicles are also a major means for transporting daily supplies and are of crucial importance to the livelihood of Hong Kong people. Hence, the TLB has always placed strong emphasis on improving cross-boundary land freight transport arrangements. In handling matters related to cross-boundary goods vehicles, the TLB always adheres to the policy principle of ""maintaining capacity and stability"" and takes into account the views of different stakeholders, so as to ensure smooth operation and adequate capacity of cross-boundary land freight transport, thereby providing staunch support for strengthening and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international maritime centre, international aviation hub and international logistics hub.

Having consulted the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, and the Transport Department (TD), our reply to various parts of the Hon Yim's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) Cross-boundary goods vehicles are subject to the regulation of the quota system which is agreed and jointly administered by the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong. If the Mainland goods vehicles need to apply for Hong Kong permit/licence, holders of the Mainland goods vehicle quotas must first apply to the relevant Mainland authority for the Mainland Approval Notice (commonly known as MAN) for their goods vehicles. The quota holders should also apply to the TD for vehicle approval and vehicle examination for their goods vehicles; upon passing the vehicle examination, they could proceed with vehicle registration and licensing as well as apply for Closed Road Permit (CRP). The TD would issue CRPs according to the approved boundary crossing(s) recorded on the MAN so that cross-boundary goods vehicles concerned could ply between Guangdong and Hong Kong via the designated boundary crossing(s). Besides, drivers from the Mainland driving the goods vehicles concerned should hold a full Hong Kong driving licence for the corresponding vehicle class(es) (such as light, medium or heavy goods vehicles). From 2022 to April 2025, the number of cross-boundary goods vehicles with valid CRPs maintained at about 10 000, among which goods vehicles from the Mainland have increased.

Guangdong and Hong Kong have been maintaining close liaison, and will review and enhance relevant facilitation measures for cross-boundary goods vehicles as appropriate subject to the development of freight logistics, local traffic capacity and trade's responses in both places. Guangdong and Hong Kong also keep reviewing the number of quotas for cross-boundary goods vehicles from time to time. If the Mainland authorities seek to increase the quotas, Hong Kong will expedite the vetting with enhanced efficiency. Besides, the TD has enhanced the arrangement of vehicle approval for cross-boundary goods vehicles with a view to completing the relevant process with enhanced speed. In general, if all the documents required are in order and accurate, the time needed for completion of vehicle approval, examination, registration and licensing, as well as CRP application has been greatly shortened to as fast as three to four weeks.

(3) The Insurance Authority has been in discussion with relevant authorities and the insurance industry on the insurance arrangement for cross-boundary vehicles, with a view to providing facilitation and appropriate insurance products. Take Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles as an example, the Government has at the same time implemented the ""unilateral recognition"" arrangement for cross-boundary motor insurance, which allows Hong Kong private cars driving into Guangdong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge to extend the coverage of their third-party liability insurance purchased from Hong Kong insurers to the Mainland, thereby eliminating the need for separate policies in both places and facilitating travel between Guangdong and Hong Kong. The Government will continue to monitor the development of the cross-boundary freight and logistics industry, and review the relevant measures in a timely manner."
立法會十題：跨境貨車的便利措施,2025-06-11 11:43,2025-06-11 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100226.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上嚴剛議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

據報，政府將於本年內公布「粵車南下」的細節，首階段僅允許非營運小型載客汽車申請。有物流運輸業界人士期望政府善用港珠澳大橋，藉「粵車南下」實施的契機，優化粵港跨境內地貨車的相關政策，以進一步鞏固香港作為粵港澳大灣區核心樞紐的角色，並帶動香港國際機場（機場）、貨櫃碼頭和整體物流業的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）政府會否在擬定「粵車南下」政策的同時，與內地部門商討優化跨境內地貨車的相關政策（包括粵港兩地政府協調的配額制度），以便利跨境貨車往來內地與香港；若會，詳情為何，包括預計時會公布相關政策；

（二）政府會否優化南下跨境內地貨車的申請流程或推出新措施，例如參考現時「封閉道路通行許可證」制度，但簡化當中的申請流程，讓一定數目的內地貨車經指定路線直達香港指定的主要貨運樞紐（包括機場貨運站和貨櫃碼頭）；及

（三）政府會否參考其他地區的經驗（例如歐洲的「綠卡制度」（一種跨國車用保險卡制度）），推動粵港澳三地汽車保險互認機制，以實現「一險通行」？

答覆：

主席：

運輸及物流局高度重視現代物流發展，並銳意將香港打造為國際智慧物流樞紐。為此，政府於二○二三年公布《現代物流發展行動綱領》，並提出透過完善多式聯運以增強香港作為貨物來往大灣區門戶和關鍵轉運樞紐的角色。其中，陸路跨境貨運是大灣區內地城市與香港之間的主要貨運模式，亦是香港與內地的「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系的重要組成部分。另一方面，跨境貨車亦是運載民生物資的主要渠道，對於香港民生物資供應至關重要。因此，運輸及物流局一向重視改善陸路跨境貨運安排，並在處理與跨境貨車有關的事宜時，緊守「保運力、保穩定」的政策原則，以及考慮不同持分者的意見，以確保陸路跨境貨運暢通和運力充足，從而為鞏固及提升香港國際航運中心、國際航空樞紐和國際物流樞紐地位作有力支撐。

經諮詢財經事務及庫務局和運輸署，就嚴議員提問的各部分現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）來往內地與香港的跨境貨車受粵港兩地政府同意並共同管理的配額制度所規管。來自內地的貨車如需申辦香港牌證，取得內地跨境貨車配額的持有人須先向內地相關部門為其貨車申請《粵港澳機動車輛往來及駕駛人駕車批准通知書》（俗稱批文卡）；配額持有人亦須為其貨車向運輸署申請車輛評定及進行車輛檢驗，在檢驗合格後可辦理車輛登記及領牌，和申領「封閉道路通行許可證」（許可證）。運輸署會根據批文卡上通行口岸的批註，簽發許可證以讓有關跨境貨車經指定口岸往來粵港兩地。此外，駕駛有關貨車來自內地的司機亦須持有該車輛類別（例如輕型、中型或重型貨車）的香港正式駕駛執照。由二○二二年至二○二五年四月，持有有效許可證的跨境貨車數目保持約有一萬輛，當中來自內地的貨車數目有增長。

粵港雙方一直保持緊密聯繫，視乎兩地貨運物流的發展情況、本地交通承載力和業界的反應，適時檢視和優化有關跨境貨車的便利措施，並不時檢視跨境貨車的配額數目。如內地有關單位提出增加配額，港方會提效加快批核。另外，運輸署亦已優化跨境貨車的車輛評定安排，以提速完成程序。一般而言，若所有申請文件齊備及準確，由車輛評定、檢驗、登記領牌、以及申請許可證，所需時間已大幅縮短至最快三至四星期內完成。

（三）保險方面，保險業監管局一直有就跨境車輛的保險安排與有關當局及保險業界商討，致力提供便利和適切保險產品。例如就「港車北上」，政府已同步推出跨境汽車保險「等效先認」安排，讓經港珠澳大橋進入廣東省行駛的香港私家車向香港保險公司投保的責任範圍可擴大到內地的第三者責任保險，而無須分別購買兩地保單，進一步便利往返粵港兩地。政府會繼續留意跨境貨運物流業的發展，適時檢視有關措施。"

立法會十六題：香港認可經濟營運商計劃,2025-06-11 11:05,2025-06-11 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100312.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上易志明議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

根據香港海關資料，自推出香港認可經濟營運商計劃至今，有約90家企業成為認可經濟營運商（AEO），其貨物運往與香港達成AEO互認安排的16個經濟體可享有便利通關安排，有助促進貨物無縫跨境流動。然而，有意見認為，現時企業參與該計劃的比率和該計劃的覆蓋範圍未夠廣泛。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，涉及香港AEO的進出口貨量及貨值，以及其佔總貨量及貨值的百分比分別為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，為提升本地及內地貨物進出口的效率，香港必須進一步擴大互認安排的覆蓋網絡，當局與更多經濟體簽署互認安排協議的進展為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見指出，企業獲認證成為AEO除可令其享有快速的通關安排外，還有助提升企業的管理水平，而內地甚至設立培訓基地以鼓勵更多企業成為AEO，政府有何措施推動更多本地企業成為AEO？

答覆：

主席︰

就易志明議員的提問，經諮詢香港海關後，現回覆如下：

過去三年，涉及香港認可經濟營運商（AEO）的進出口貨量及貨值，以及其佔總貨量及貨值的百分比如下：

目前香港已和16個經濟體簽訂AEO互認安排，按數目計全球排名第四，僅次於中國內地、韓國及美國。香港海關一直積極拓展AEO互認安排的全球網絡，近年亦取得良好進展，先後與包括土耳其、沙特阿拉伯、柬埔寨、菲律賓、阿拉伯聯合酋長國、老撾、秘魯及智利在內的八個經濟體簽訂了互認安排的行動計劃，這標誌着雙方落實發展互認安排的重要第一步。香港海關正積極與這些經濟體的海關組織就簽訂互認安排進行商討和跟進工作。

展望將來，香港海關會持續擴展互認安排網絡，主動聯繫香港主要貿易夥伴及配合國家「一帶一路」發展策略，優先與「一帶一路」經濟體，包括東南亞國家聯盟、海灣阿拉伯國家合作委員會成員國、南美及非洲地區等商討發展互認安排，務求讓更多企業受惠。

為推動本地企業成為香港AEO，香港海關持續透過與業界、各大商會和相關合作夥伴的合作，舉辦各類型的宣傳及推廣活動，包括簡介會及展覽攤位，以提升企業對香港AEO計劃的認識。去年，香港海關於不同的大型活動期間，例如由「一帶一路」辦公室及香港貿易發展局（貿發局）合辦的「一帶一路高峰論壇」，以及由香港特別行政區政府及貿發局主辦的亞洲物流航運及空運會議，設置展覽攤位及舉行專題研討會，促進與不同領域及業界的交流。同時，香港海關亦透過網頁及社交媒體發布有關本地與全球AEO計劃發展的最新消息，擴大推廣及宣傳工作的接觸面，並加強與持份者的溝通和連繫。

為進一步提升香港AEO計劃的吸引力，香港海關積極爭取與不同的機構組織合作，為AEO提供更多優惠。其中包括與香港出口信用保險局合作，為香港AEO提供免費買家信用評估服務，協助AEO應對市場風險。此外，香港海關於二○二三年與國家海關總署和澳門海關簽訂內地、香港及澳門海關AEO互認安排下關於《深化粵港澳大灣區AEO合作的備忘錄》，透過互相推薦AEO申請、加強聯合宣傳和人員培訓等措施，深化三方海關的合作，並有助三地企業把握粵港澳大灣區的發展機遇。"
LCQ16: Hong Kong Authorized Economic Operator Programme,2025-06-11 11:05,2025-06-11 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100309.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Frankie Yick and a written reply by the the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

  According to the information of the Customs and Excise Department, since the launch of the Hong Kong Authorized Economic Operator Programme, about 90 enterprises have become Authorized Economic Operators (AEOs), and their goods transported to the 16 economies with which Hong Kong has entered into AEO mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) can enjoy customs facilitation arrangements, which is instrumental in facilitating seamless cross-boundary movement of goods. However, there are views that the current rate of enterprise participation in the Programme and the coverage of the Programme are not extensive enough. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the volume and value of imported and exported goods involving Hong Kong AEOs in the past three years, as well as their respective percentages in the total volume and value of such goods;

(2) as there are views that in order to enhance the efficiency of the import and export of local and Mainland goods, Hong Kong must further extend the coverage of the MRA network, of the progress of the authorities' entering into MRA agreements with more economies; and

(3) as there are views that apart from enabling enterprises to enjoy speedy customs arrangements, being accredited as the AEOs also helps enhance the management standards of enterprises, and the Mainland has even set up training bases to encourage more enterprises to become the AEOs, of the measures put in place by the Government to encourage more local enterprises to become the AEOs?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), the reply to the question raised by the Hon Frankie Yick is as follows:

  The volume and value of imported and exported goods involving Hong Kong Authorized Economic Operators (AEOs) in the past three years, along with their respective percentages in the total volume and value of imported and exported goods, are shown below:




Year
Volume of imported and exported goods involving Hong Kong AEOs (consignment)

2022
1.78 million

2024
3.52 million

1,318 billion
13.90%




  At present, Hong Kong has ratified AEO mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) with 16 economies, ranking fourth globally in terms of the number of MRAs after Mainland China, Korea and the United States. The C&ED has been proactively expanding the global network of AEO MRAs with good progress made in recent years. It has signed action plans for AEO MRAs with eight economies including Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Cambodia, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, Laos, Peru and Chile, marking a significant step towards the conclusion of the MRAs by both sides. The C&ED is now actively engaged in discussions and follow-up work with the customs administrations of these economies regarding the MRAs.

  Looking ahead, the C&ED will continue its efforts to expand the MRA network by actively liaising with Hong Kong's major trading partners and dovetailing with the national development strategy on the Belt and Road Initiative. Priority will be given to discussing the MRAs with Belt and Road economies, including member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, and economies in the South American and African regions, with a view to benefitting more enterprises.

  To encourage local enterprises to become Hong Kong AEOs, the C&ED has continuously collaborated with the industry, major chambers of commerce and relevant partners to organise different types of publicity and promotional events, including briefing sessions and exhibition booths, to enhance enterprises' understanding of the Hong Kong AEO Programme. Last year, the C&ED set up exhibition booths and hosted thematic seminars at major events, such as the Belt and Road Summit jointly organised by the Belt and Road Office and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), as well as the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the HKTDC, with a view to fostering exchanges with different fields and industries. In addition, the C&ED has been disseminating the latest information on the developments of local and global AEO programmes through its website and social media channels, so as to extend the reach of its publicity and promotional efforts as well as strengthen communication and engagement with stakeholders.

  To further enhance the appeal of the Hong Kong AEO Programme, the C&ED has been actively seeking co-operation with various organisations to offer more benefits to the AEOs. For instance, the C&ED collaborates with the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation to provide Hong Kong AEOs with free buyers' credit checks to help them cope with market risks. In addition, the C&ED signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Enhancing AEO Co-operation in the Greater Bay Area among Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao Customs under the AEO MRAs with the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China and the Macao Customs Service in 2023. Through such initiatives as the mutual referral mechanism on AEO applications, enhanced joint publicity and staff training, the MoU deepens the co-operation among the three customs administrations and supports enterprises of the three places to seize development opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area."

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.

HKMoA's new exhibition unveils and showcases three preeminent collections in Hong Kong for first time (with photos),2025-06-10 20:40,2025-06-10 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000317.htm,"The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) will launch the exhibition ""The Pride of Hong Kong: Three Preeminent Collections of Ancient Paintings and Calligraphies"" from June 11 to October 7, converging for the first time treasures from three world-class collections - Xubaizhai, established by the late renowned local collector Low Chuck-tiew; Chih Lo Lou, by Ho Iu-kwong; and Bei Shan Tang, by Lee Jung-sen, which are highly revered locally and internationally. Ninety-three sets of masterpieces from the Tang to the Qing dynasties will be exhibited, showcasing Hong Kong's golden age of collecting.

The exhibition, presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, is jointly organised by the HKMoA and the Art Museum of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Addressing the opening ceremony held today (June 10), the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan, said that in the mid-20th century, Chinese national treasures were featured in a large quantity in Hong Kong. Foreign art dealers and collectors were highly enthusiastic to acquire these treasures. With the resolve to retain these embodiments of Chinese heritage on home soil, the three collectors were determined to collect ancient Chinese masterpieces. The three world-class private treasured collections, namely Xubaizhai, Chih Lo Lou and Bei Shan Tang, were thus built up. Moreover, the three collectors and their families donated their invaluable collections to the HKMoA and the Art Museum of the CUHK for exhibition and educational purposes, providing the public with the opportunity to appreciate Chinese painting and calligraphy. The three collectors and their families, committed to preserving and promoting Chinese culture, have demonstrated their honourable generosity.

Other officiating guests included Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the CUHK Professor Anthony Chan; the Chief Executive Officer of Bei Shan Tang Foundation, Ms Lillian Kiang; the Chairman of the Art Sub-committee of the Museum Advisory Committee, Professor Desmond Hui; and the Museum Director of the HKMoA, Dr Maria Mok.

The three preeminent collections stand out in distinctiveness. The Xubaizhai Collection covers the major Ming and Qing schools, fully epitomising the development of Chinese painting and calligraphy traditions. Highlight exhibits include Dong Qichang's ""Landscape and Calligraphy in Running Script"", ""Illustrations for the Odes of Qi"" attributed to Ma Hezhi, Zhang Feng's ""Scholar by an Old Tree"" and Luo Pin's ""The Realm of Ghosts"".

The Chih Lo Lou Collection, under the guiding collecting principle of ""artist before his art"", emphasises works from the Ming-Qing transition. Huang Daozhou's ""Pines and Rock"", Zhu Da (Bada Shanren)'s ""Landscapes"", Wu Bin's ""Misty River and Piled Peaks"" and Jinshi's ""Poems and Essays in Running-cursive Script"" are some of the highlight exhibits.

The Bei Shan Tang Collection, rich in both paintings and calligraphies spanning a number of dynasties, especially the Ming and Qing periods, is notable for its leading masters, while some of the works are rare or the only extant pieces by the respective artists. Highlight exhibits include Wen Zhengming's ""Ci-poem for Xu Lin in Running Script"", Tao Xuan's ""Pavilion against Distant Mountains"", and Wang Chong's ""Loan Agreement in Running Script"" and ""Garden after Snow"" during the Southern Song dynasty.

The HKMoA has also invited Hong Kong artist Yau Wing-fung to draw inspiration from the varied perspectives and stylised rocks and mountains in late Ming and early Qing painter Huang Xiangjian's depictions of his reunion journeys in the three preeminent collections, and to create two installations ""To and Fro"" and ""Mirage Harmony"", which retell the unique story of the distinctive landforms of Hong Kong's 18 administrative districts from a contemporary perspective.

The exhibition will be held at the Chih Lo Lou Gallery of Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, the Wu Guanzhong Art Gallery and the Jingguanlou Gallery on the fourth floor of the HKMoA (10 Salisbury Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon). Admission is free. Sponsored by Bei Shan Tang Foundation, the exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue and an international academic lecture series. Scholars from the region and overseas will deliver talks on appreciating Chinese paintings and calligraphy, as well as the history of Chinese art collections in various places.

The exhibition is also one of the activities in the Chinese Culture Promotion Series."
香港藝術館新展覽揭幕　首次同場展出香港三大古書畫收藏（附圖）,2025-06-10 20:40,2025-06-10 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000314.htm,"香港藝術館將由六月十一日至十月七日呈獻「香江藏珍──香港三大古書畫收藏」展覽，首次讓三大世界級寶庫—包括由已故本地收藏巨擘劉作籌建立的「虛白齋」、何耀光的「至樂樓」以及利榮森的「北山堂」，同場亮相。展覽精選九十三組橫跨唐代至清代的享譽中外文化的傳世瑰寶，見證香港收藏界的輝煌時代。

展覽由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）主辦、香港藝術館和香港中文大學文物館聯合籌劃。康文署署長陳詠雯今日（六月十日）在展覽開幕典禮上致辭時表示，二十世紀中大量中國書畫及文物珍品輾轉流入香港，外國畫商和收藏家爭相搶購。三位收藏家希望將國粹留在中華大地，竭力搜羅中國歷代書畫珍品，因而創建了虛白齋、至樂樓及北山堂這三批世界級的私人珍藏。他們及其家人更將珍藏饋贈香港藝術館和香港中文大學文物館，作公開展示和教育用途，讓大眾了解鑑賞中國書畫之道。三位藏家及其家族盡心保護和推廣中華文化，彰顯化私為公的高尚情操。

其他主禮嘉賓包括香港中文大學副校長陳德章教授、北山堂基金行政總裁江馨平、博物館諮詢委員會藝術專責委員會主席許焯權教授，以及香港藝術館總館長莫家詠博士。

三大古書畫收藏各具特色。虛白齋藏品涵蓋了明清時期的主要流派，全面而清晰地反映中國書畫藝術傳統發展的脈絡。精選展品包括董其昌的《山水行書合冊》、傳為馬和之所繪的《齊風六篇》、張風的《古木高士圖》和羅聘的《鬼趣圖》等。

至樂樓以「先人品而後藝事」作為其收藏的先決條件，藏品以明末清初的書畫最為豐富。精選展品包括黃道周的《松石圖》、朱耷（八大山人）的《山水冊》、吳彬的《煙江疊嶂圖》和今釋的《行草書詩文冊》等。

北山堂的收藏書畫兼重，涵蓋歷朝，以明清之作居多，當中有孤本罕品，也有名家翰墨。精選展品包括文徵明的《行書寄金陵友人詞》、陶鉉的《幽亭遠岫圖》、王寵的《行書借券》和南宋時期的《庭園雪霽圖》等。

香港藝術館亦邀請了本地藝術家邱榮豐，以三大收藏中明末清初畫家黃向堅《尋親圖》系列中多變的視角及誇張變形的山石造境為啟發，創作兩組藝術裝置作品《迴渡》及《蜃曲》，用當代的角度重新詮釋一個獨特的香港十八區山水故事。

展覽在九龍尖沙咀梳士巴利道十號香港藝術館四樓至樂樓藏中國書畫館、吳冠中藝術廳及靜觀樓藏品廳舉行，免費入場。展覽得到北山堂基金贊助出版展覽圖錄及舉辦國際學術講座系列，邀請海內外專家學者主講，帶領觀眾從深度學術角度欣賞中國古代書畫珍品，了解各地中國書畫的收藏歷史。有關展覽及相關活動詳情，請瀏覽網頁https://hk.art.museum/tc/web/ma/exhibitions-and-events/the-pride-of-hong-kong.html。​

水務署發言人表示，《2024年水務設施（修訂）條例》（修訂條例）加強水務監督在調查懷疑濫收水費個案時取證和披露資料的權力，要求業主和其代理人等提交租約、水費收據或付款紀錄，沒有遵從要求可被視作違例，一經定罪可處罰款最高10,000元，以及可就罪行持續期間每日另處罰款最高1,000元，預期檢控個案的數量將會增加。修訂條例提高濫收水費的罰款至最高25,000元，從而打擊濫收水費的違法行為。此外，向水務監督提供虛假或具誤導性資料屬犯罪，最高刑罰為罰款25,000元及監禁六個月。

發言人強烈勸諭業主為其劏房租戶申請安裝獨立水錶，以減低違反修訂條例的風險。水務署鼓勵公眾舉報濫收水費的非法行為，以便該署跟進及調查。市民可致電水務署熱線3468 4963或透過WhatsApp專線5665 5517申請為劏房租戶安裝獨立水錶。該署WhatsApp專線亦會處理濫收劏房租戶水費事宜。此外，市民亦可致電水務署客戶諮詢熱線2824 5000舉報濫收劏房租戶水費，接通並選擇語言後，再按「7」字，便可直接向職員舉報。"
WSD-registered consumer convicted of failing to provide relevant information or documents for suspected case of overcharging for water,2025-06-10 20:25,2025-06-10 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000565.htm,"The Water Supplies Department (WSD) announced that alimited company was convicted today (June 10) of failing to comply with the Water Authority's request to provide relevant information or documents for a suspected case of overcharging for water, in contravention of regulation 47A of the Waterworks Regulations. The consumer pleaded guilty to the offence at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. The company is a WSD-registered consumer of a subdivided unit (SDU) in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.

A spokesman for the WSD said that the Waterworks (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 (the amended WWO) has strengthened the power of the Water Authority in evidence collection and information disclosure during the investigation of suspected cases of overcharging for water. The Water Authority can request the landlords, their agents, etc, to provide the tenancy agreement, receipt or payment record for charges for water. Failure to comply with such a request can be an offence, and the offender is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $10,000 and a further fine of up to $1,000 for each day the offence continues. It is anticipated that there will be more prosecution cases. The maximum penalty for overcharging tenants of SDUs for water has been raised to $25,000 to deter this illegal act. Moreover, providing false or misleading information to the Water Authority is also an offence with a maximum penalty of a $25,000 fine and six months' imprisonment.

  The WSD spokesman strongly appealed to landlords to apply for the installation of separate water meters for their SDUs, which can greatly reduce the risk of contravening the amended WWO. The WSD encourages the public to report any illegal act of overcharging SDU tenants for water for follow-up and investigation by the department. The public can call the WSD Hotline 3468 4963 or WhatsApp 5665 5517 to apply for the installation of separate water meters for SDUs. The WhatsApp hotline also handles matters relating to water overcharging in SDUs. Alternatively, the public can call the WSD Customer Enquiry Hotline 2824 5000 to report water overcharge cases.

   行動期間，漁護署人員於長洲附近水域發現一艘本地漁船涉嫌非法使用蛇籠（一種已被禁止在香港水域使用的浸籠）捕魚，遂於晚上約九時三十分截停有關船隻進行調查。漁護署其後從船上檢走一批捕魚工具（包括蛇籠和絞轆）。

   漁護署現正從涉嫌以蛇籠捕魚並違反《漁業保護條例》（第171章）的方向，調查船上一名本地船長及六名內地過港漁工。

任何人士在本港水域使用船隻捕魚時，其船隻必須已根據《漁業保護條例》登記及按其本地漁船登記證明書上所列出的捕魚方法捕魚。本地漁船登記證明書有關浸籠部分的登記條件亦指明任何摺疊式浸籠不得以任何方式與另一浸籠連接，或其任何一面伸展後的長度不得超過五米。因此，使用蛇籠捕魚亦屬違法。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款10萬元及監禁六個月。

漁護署發言人強調︰「政府一直致力打擊香港水域的非法捕魚活動，漁護署會繼續加強巡邏和嚴格執法。」"
AFCD investigates Mainland fisherman deckhands and local coxswain suspected of using snake cages for fishing (with photo),2025-06-10 20:05,2025-06-10 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000768.htm," A joint operation was conducted by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) together with the Hong Kong Police Force and Zhuhai Municipal Marine Comprehensive Law Enforcement Team in the southern waters of Hong Kong yesterday (June 9).

  During the operation, the AFCD personnel intercepted a local fishing vessel suspected of engaging in fishing using snake cages (a type of cage trap banned in Hong Kong waters) in waters off Cheung Chau at around 9.30pm for investigation. Some fishing gear (including snake cages and winches) on board was seized by the AFCD.

 The AFCD is investigating a local coxswain and six Mainland fisherman deckhands on board suspected of engaging in fishing using snake cages, in violation of the Fisheries Protection Ordinance (Cap. 171).

 Only a vessel registered under the Ordinance can be used for fishing in Hong Kong waters and only the fishing methods listed on its Certificate of Registration of Local Fishing Vessel can be employed for fishing by the vessel. The conditions of the Certificate of Registration of Local Fishing Vessel regarding cage traps also stipulate that any collapsible cage traps should not be connected in any way to another; or should not exceed five metres in any of its extended dimensions. Hence, it is unlawful to fish using snake cages. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $100,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction.

 A spokesman for the AFCD stressed, ""The Government is committed to combatting illegal fishing activities in Hong Kong waters. The AFCD will continue to step up patrols and take stringent enforcement action."""

由香港房屋委員會（房委會）主辦的「屋邨管理服務承辦商大獎2024」頒獎禮今日（六月十日）在油塘大本型舉行，共頒發90個獎項，表揚過去一年在管理房委會轄下物業有傑出表現的服務承辦商及前線員工。

房委會今年特別增設獎項，嘉許在打擊濫用公屋方面有重大貢獻的傑出前線人員，感謝他們竭力維護寶貴的公屋資源。

  房屋署副署長（屋邨管理）楊耀輝在頒獎禮上表示：「公共房屋是社會的寶貴資源，我們必須善用及合理編配給真正有住屋需要的人士。房委會一直致力打擊濫用公屋行為（『打濫』），我們鼓勵服務承辦商與我們合力維護公屋資源。」

他說：「我們已在服務承辦商評分制度中設立獎勵機制，『打濫』表現良好的服務承辦商會獲額外加分，有助增加投標和中標機會。事實上，服務承辦商前線員工在偵測個案方面給予我們同事的協助，成效十分顯著，讓我們的『打濫』工作取得理想成績。」

  二○二四年度的獎項名單中，共有17間為房委會提供物業管理、清潔、保安和停車場管理服務的承辦商獲獎；另外亦有八名物業服務經理和56名前線員工獲得嘉許。得獎名單詳見附表。

  本年度獲得「最佳公共屋邨（物業服務）大型公共屋邨組別」獎項的承辦商所管理的屋邨分別為天耀（一）及天耀（二）邨、彩園邨、厚德邨和石籬（二）邨；而獲得「最佳公共屋邨（物業服務）小型公共屋邨組別」獎項的承辦商所管理的屋邨則分別為榮昌邨、華貴邨（華愛樓）和龍逸邨。

  現時房委會轄下超過半數公共屋邨的管理工作均外判予物業管理服務承辦商負責，屋邨內很多主要的維修工作亦由服務承辦商負責監督。房委會期望借助私營機構的資源及其管理私人樓宇的經驗，持續提升公共屋邨管理服務水平，為居民提供安全和舒適的居住環境。"

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) hosted the Estate Management Services Contractors Awards (EMSC Awards) 2024 presentation ceremony at Domain in Yau Tong today (June 10). A total of 90 awards were presented to the estate management services contractors and frontline staff in recognition of their outstanding performances in managing the HA's properties last year.

  The HA introduced a new award this year to recognise the significant contributions of outstanding frontline staff on combating tenancy abuse, in appreciation of their efforts in safeguarding this valuable housing resource.

  Officiating at the presentation ceremony, the Deputy Director of Housing (Estate Management), Mr Ricky Yeung, said, ""Public housing resources are precious and should be allocated appropriately and rationally to those in genuine need of housing. The HA has been committed to combating tenancy abuse in public housing. We are encouraging services contractors to collaborate with us in safeguarding these housing resources.

  ""We have implemented a reward mechanism in the service contractor evaluation system, whereby services contractors who perform well in combating tenancy abuse will receive additional points, enhancing their bidding and contracting opportunities. Indeed, the effectiveness of the assistance provided by frontline staff of services contractors to our colleagues in detecting cases has been significant, helping our work in combating tenancy abuse achieve the desired results.""

  The EMSC Awards in 2024 went to 17 services contractors providing property management, cleaning, security and car park operating services. Eight property services managers and 56 frontline staff members were also commended. The full list of awardees is in the Annex.

  The estates managed by the winners of the Best Public Rental Housing Estate (Property Services) Large Estate award this year include Tin Yiu (I) & Tin Yiu (II) Estate, Choi Yuen Estate, Hau Tak Estate and Shek Lei (II) Estate, while the estates managed by the winners of the Best Public Rental Housing Estate (Property Services) Small Estate award include Wing Cheong Estate, Wah Kwai Estate (Wah Oi House) and Lung Yat Estate.

  Currently, the management of more than half of the HA's public rental housing estates is outsourced to property services contractors, and many major maintenance tasks in the HA estates are being supervised by them. By leveraging the private sector's resources and experience in managing private properties, the HA seeks to continuously raise the quality of its estate management services and provide a pleasant living environment for its tenants."

Mr Nick Chan (Director of the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre), Deputy Commissioner Mr Fang Jianming (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), heads of AALCO disputes resolution centres, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  A very good afternoon. It is both an honour and a privilege to stand before you today as we mark a significant milestone - the third anniversary of the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre. Over the past three years, AALCO Hong Kong has not only flourished but has also become a cornerstone of Hong Kong's reputation as a world-class destination for international dispute resolution. Today, we celebrate not just an institution, but a shared vision: a future where Hong Kong continues to maintain and strengthen our status as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

  Three years ago, AALCO's choice to establish its newest regional arbitration centre in Hong Kong reflected AALCO members' resounding confidence in our city's rule of law, legal talent, and many other unique advantages as an international financial centre and legal services and disputes resolution centre under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", and of course, also Hong Kong's location, being the heart of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) development and an important gateway of the Belt and Road Initiative.

  Since its establishment, AALCO Hong Kong has made significant contributions in enhancing Hong Kong's regional arbitration capabilities. By providing a neutral and efficient platform for dispute resolution, AALCO Hong Kong has facilitated the settlement of cross-border commercial disputes, reinforcing confidence in the legal systems of Asian and African economies.

  AALCO Hong Kong has also organised various seminars and training programmes for capacity building of dispute resolution professionals and international collaboration by working closely with governments, arbitral institutions, and legal bodies to harmonise arbitration practices across different jurisdictions, especially in the GBA and the Belt and Road regions. For example, we are very happy to see that AALCO Hong Kong supported the Second Instalment of the 7th Belt and Road Conference hosted by the Law Society of Hong Kong, which featured engaging and fruitful dialogues in promoting a peaceful dispute resolution worldwide.

  I wish to extend my deepest congratulations and gratitude to AALCO, the legal community, and all stakeholders who have supported AALCO Hong Kong's growth. This milestone is not just a proof to AALCO Hong Kong's achievements over the past three years, but also a reflection of Hong Kong's growing role as a leading hub for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. As we look ahead, the demand for arbitration and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services will grow, driven by increasing cross-border trade, Belt and Road Initiative projects, digital economy disputes, and international sports events.

  Let us reaffirm our commitment to advancing the edge of arbitration, promoting ADR, and building a more interconnected legal and dispute resolution landscape for Asia, Africa, and beyond. To conclude, I wish AALCO Hong Kong many more years of success. Thank you."

The event provided deep insights into Hong Kong's latest policy developments including family office policies and tax incentives. The session was well received, drawing participation from over 60 representatives of legal and professional firms serving high-net-worth clients. The event sparked active discussions, with participants expressing keen interest and strong confidence in the evolving role of Hong Kong's professional services sector and the future of Hong Kong's family office ecosystem.

Key topics covered included interpretation of Hong Kong's latest family office policies, comparisons with regional regimes and tax incentives, case studies and a question-and-answer session. The session aimed to enhance understanding among legal and advisory firms of Hong Kong's policy landscape, strengthen participant's positioning as cross-border advisors to ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), and facilitate the development of business networks in Hong Kong.

Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Charles Ng said, ""Hong Kong is the leading hub for asset and wealth management in Asia with over US$4 trillion in assets under management. Our city is recognised as a trusted gateway for global capital seeking access to opportunities across Asia and beyond. Our leadership is further evidenced by our standing as Asia's largest hedge fund hub and Asia's largest cross-border wealth management centre. The professional services sector plays a strategic and indispensable role in enabling this ecosystem to flourish. InvestHK is committed to working closely with legal, accounting, trust, and advisory professionals to promote policy understanding and strengthen Hong Kong's competitiveness in cross-border wealth management and succession planning.""

Legal professionals attending the event provided perspectives on Hong Kong's family office policies and the growing opportunities arising from them. The Chair of the Family Office Committee at the Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Chan Chak-ming, said, ""With increasing interest from UHNWIs in Asia, Hong Kong's forward-looking initiatives, including tax incentives and efficient market processes, solidify its position as the region's leading destination for family offices. Together with InvestHK, we aim to strengthen Hong Kong's role as a nexus for global wealth, ensuring it remains responsive to the sophisticated needs of UHNWIs while reinforcing trust and long-term confidence.""

InvestHK will continue to collaborate with industry stakeholders to support legal and advisory firms in expanding their high-end wealth services in Hong Kong, and to promote the city as a premier hub for family offices and a cross-border wealth management centre in Asia, helping Mainland and international families of UHNWIs achieve long-term goals in asset growth and succession."

ÂÂÂ ""Reversed Front: Bonfire"" was released under the guise of a game with the aim of promoting secessionist agendas such as ""Taiwan independence"" and ""Hong Kong independence"", advocating armed revolution and the overthrow of the fundamental system of the Peopleâs Republic of China established by the Constitution of the Peopleâs Republic of China. It also has an intention to provoke hatred towards the Central Authorities and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Any person or organisation who knowingly publishes the application or related content, including sharing or recommending the application to others via the Internet, may commit the offence of ""incitement to secession"" under Article 21 and the offence of ""incitement to subversion"" under Article 23 of the Hong Kong National Security Law, as well as ""offences in connection with seditious intention"" under Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

ÂÂÂ In addition, those who have downloaded the application may be regarded as in possession of a publication that has a seditious intention. Under Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, a person who, without reasonable excuse, possesses a publication that has a seditious intention, commits an offence. A person who provides pecuniary or other financial assistance or property to the application developer, including making payment through in-app purchases, with an intent to provide funding to the relevant developer for the commission of secession or subversion, also commits an offence.

ÂÂÂ With the approval of the Secretary for Security, NSD has implemented disabling action on electronic messages related to ""Reversed Front: Bonfire"" in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Implementation Rules for Article 43 of the Hong Kong National Security Law.

ÂÂÂ NSD again reminds that acts or activities endangering national security are extremely serious offences. Police will ensure that the law is observed and strictly enforced, and will take resolute actions to bring offenders to account. Members of the public should not download the application or provide funding by any means to the relevant developer. Those who have downloaded the application should uninstall it immediately and must not attempt to defy the law.

二零二五年第一季服務行業按季業務收益指數,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000379.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月十日）發表的業務收益指數的臨時數字顯示，二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第一季比較，不少主要服務行業以價值計算的業務收益均有不同程度的升幅。

二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第一季比較，金融業（銀行除外）（+32.5%）、保險業（+23.1%）、進出口貿易業（+19.4%）及銀行業（+19.0%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，地產業（-6.7%）及零售業（-6.5%）的業務收益指數同期則錄得跌幅。

按服務界別分析，電腦及資訊科技服務界別的業務收益指數同期按年上升60.2%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別的業務收益指數亦按年上升1.1%。

二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第四季比較，不少主要服務行業經季節性調整的業務收益（以價值計算）均錄得不同程度的升幅。當中，保險業（+32.5%）、進出口貿易業（+20.3%）及銀行業（+19.9%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，地產業的業務收益指數同期則下跌5.7%。

按服務界別分析，二零二五年第一季與二零二四年第四季比較，電腦及資訊科技服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數上升50.3%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數亦上升0.7%。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第一季不少服務行業的業務收益較去年同期上升。較顯著的升幅見於金融業（銀行除外）、保險業、進出口貿易業，以及銀行業。

展望未來，經濟增長應為服務行業的業務提供支持。內地經濟繼續增長和香港政府各項增強經濟動能的措施應有利服務行業的業務，儘管一些行業或會受外圍環境的不確定性及市民和旅客於本地市場的消費模式轉變帶來的持續不利因素所影響。

進一步資料

表1載列最近五季選定服務行業及服務界別的業務收益指數及其相應按年變動百分率，而表2則載列最近五季經季節性調整的業務收益指數按季變動百分率。

二零二五年第一季的業務收益指數的修訂數字將於二零二五年七月十八日在政府統計處網站(www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/web_table.html?id=660-69001)發布。

編製業務收益指數所用的數據主要來自政府統計處進行的「服務行業按季統計調查」，並輔以香港金融管理局及香港旅遊發展局提供的有關數據。

服務界別有別於服務行業，前者包括橫跨不同行業但與某個共同主題相關的經濟活動。服務界別可能包括某個服務行業內所有機構單位進行的全部經濟活動，而該服務行業與該服務界別關係密切。然而，在一個與該服務界別關係不太密切的服務行業內，只有部分機構單位甚或只有這些機構單位的部分經濟活動是與該服務界別有關。以旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別為例，這界別包括所有會議展覽機構的服務、短期住宿服務及旅行社所提供的服務，以及食肆、零售商及運輸服務營辦商的部分服務（只包括以旅客為對象的服務）。

服務行業的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各類經濟統計調查，把經濟單位分類歸入合適的行業類別。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《二零二五年第一季服務行業按季業務收益指數》報告內。用戶可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

二零二五年第一季建造工程完成量統計數字,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000354.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月十日）公布「建造工程完成量按季統計調查」的臨時結果。主要承建商於二零二五年第一季所完成的建造工程名義總值的總計為705億元，較上年同期上升1.9%。

剔除價格變動的影響後，臨時結果顯示以實質計算，主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值的總計於同期間輕微下跌0.9%。以實質計算的建造工程完成量總值，是透過適當的物價指數去平減相應的建造工程完成量名義總值至二零零零年基期的價格水平計算而成。

按建造工程類別分析，於二零二五年第一季完成的私人地盤建造工程名義總值為194億元，較上年同期下跌10.7%。以實質計算，跌幅為12.7%。於二零二五年第一季完成的公營地盤建造工程名義總值較上年同期上升17.4%至305億元。以實質計算，升幅為13.8%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第一季所完成的非地盤建造工程名義總值為206億元，較上年同期下跌3.9%。以實質計算，跌幅為5.7%。非地盤建造工程包括小規模新建工程及樓房裝飾、樓宇修葺及保養工程，和非地盤的電器設備安裝及保養工程。

按主要用途類別分析，住宅樓宇建造工程於二零二五年第一季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值為209億元，較上年同期上升5.0%。同期間，運輸工程於二零二五年第一季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值下跌19.4%至88億元。

以經季節性調整的數字按季比較，主要承建商於二零二五年第一季完成的建造工程名義總值較二零二四年第四季輕微上升0.1%。以實質計算，則下跌1.0%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第一季所完成的建造工程總值臨時數字列載於表1。二零二四年全年及第四季的修訂數字則分別列載於表2及表3。

由於分判建造工程在建造業內十分普遍，一間建造業機構可以是某一合約的主要承建商，同時亦可以是另一合約的分判承建商。主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值，只包括該等建造業機構作為主要承建商合約中所完成的建造工程，而不包括其作為分判承建商所完成的建造工程。然而，分判承建商所完成的建造工程總值，應已包括在其受聘的主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值之內。

建造業機構單位的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各經濟統計調查，把經濟單位撥歸不同的行業類別。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《建造工程完成量按季統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1090002&scode=330）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

二零二五年五月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000328.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月十日）發表二零二五年五月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年四月在收縮區域的41.2上升至二零二五年五月的42.1，而未來一個月（即二零二五年六月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.4。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但不少統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年五月較上月上升，特別是進出口貿易業（從40.2上升至41.9）及批發業（從40.0上升至41.5）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年四月的42.0上升至二零二五年五月的44.0，而未來一個月（即二零二五年六月）的新訂單展望動向指數為45.8。

評論

政府發言人表示，隨着環球貿易摩擦略見緩和，五月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均有所改善。整體就業情況亦略為好轉。

展望未來，外圍環境的不確定性會繼續影響營商氣氛。然而，本地經濟表現強韌，內地經濟持續穩步增長，應可提供有力支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for May 2025,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000333.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (June 10) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for May 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 41.2 in April 2025 in the contractionary zone to 42.1 in May 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. June 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.4. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in May 2025 as compared with previous month for many surveyed sectors, particularly for the import and export trades (from 40.2 to 41.9) and wholesale trade (from 40.0 to 41.5).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades increased from 42.0 in April 2025 to 44.0 in May 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month’s time (i.e. June 2025) was 45.8.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month's time saw some improvement in May, as the global trade tensions eased somewhat. The overall employment situation also turned slightly better.

  Looking ahead, the uncertain external environment could continue to affect business sentiment. Nonetheless, the resilient local economy and sustained steady growth in the Mainland economy should provide a solid backstop. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

Quarterly business receipts indices for service industries for first quarter of 2025,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000391.htm,"  Business receipts in value terms of many major service industries showed increases of varying magnitudes in the first quarter of 2025 when compared with the first quarter of 2024, according to the provisional figures of business receipts indices released today (June 10) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  Comparing the first quarter of 2025 with the first quarter of 2024, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the financing (except banking) (+32.5%), insurance (+23.1%), import/export trade (+19.4%) and banking (+19.0%) industries. On the other hand, decreases were recorded in business receipts indices of the real estate (-6.7%) and retail (-6.5%) industries during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 60.2% year-on-year during the same period, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 1.1% year-on-year.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, business receipts in value terms of many major service industries recorded increases of varying magnitudes in the first quarter of 2025 when compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. In particular, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the insurance (+32.5%), import/export trade (+20.3%) and banking (+19.9%) industries. On the other hand, business receipts index of the real estate industry decreased by 5.7% during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, comparing the first quarter of 2025 with the fourth quarter of 2024 on a seasonally adjusted basis, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 50.3%, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 0.7%.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business receipts of many service industries recorded increases in the first quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. More notable increases in business receipts were seen for the financing (except banking), insurance, import/export trade and banking industries.

  Looking ahead, business of the service industries should be supported by economic growth. Continued growth of the Mainland economy and the Hong Kong Government's various measures to boost economic momentum should be conducive to the businesses of the services industries, though some industries may be affected by the continued headwinds stemming from the uncertainties in the external environment and the changing consumption patterns of residents and visitors in the local market.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the business receipts indices and their corresponding year-on-year rates of change in respect of selected service industries and service domains for the recent five quarters, while Table 2 shows the corresponding quarter-to-quarter rates of change in the business receipts indices for the recent five quarters based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The revised figures of business receipts indices for the first quarter of 2025 will be released at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=660-69001) on July 18, 2025.

  Data for compiling the business receipts indices are mainly based on the Quarterly Survey of Service Industries conducted by the C&SD, supplemented by relevant data provided by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

  A service domain differs from a service industry in that it comprises those economic activities which straddle different industries but are somehow related to a common theme. It may include all activities carried out by all establishments in a service industry that is closely related to the domain. For a service industry that is less closely related, however, only a portion of the establishments in the industry or even only part of the economic activities of the establishments is related to the domain.

Construction output for first quarter of 2025,2025-06-10 16:30,2025-06-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000355.htm,"  The total gross value of construction works (GVCW) performed by main contractors in the first quarter of 2025 increased by 1.9% in nominal terms over a year earlier to $70.5 billion, according to the provisional results of the Quarterly Survey of Construction Output released today (June 10) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  After discounting the effect of price changes, the provisional results showed that the total GVCW performed by main contractors slightly decreased by 0.9% in real terms over the same period. GVCW in real terms is derived by deflating the corresponding nominal value with an appropriate price index to the price level in the base period of 2000.

  Analysed by type of construction works, the GVCW performed at private sector sites totalled $19.4 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down by 10.7% in nominal terms over a year earlier. In real terms, it decreased by 12.7%. The GVCW performed at public sector sites increased by 17.4% in nominal terms over a year earlier to $30.5 billion in the first quarter of 2025. In real terms, it increased by 13.8%.

  The GVCW performed by main contractors at locations other than construction sites amounted to $20.6 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down by 3.9% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier. In real terms, it decreased by 5.7%. Construction works at locations other than construction sites included minor new construction activities and decoration, repair and maintenance for buildings; and electrical equipment installation and maintenance works at locations other than construction sites.

  Analysed by major end-use group, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of residential buildings projects amounted to $20.9 billion in the first quarter of 2025, up by 5.0% in nominal terms over a year earlier. Over the same period, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of transport projects down by 19.4% in nominal terms to $8.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, the GVCW performed by main contractors slightly increased by 0.1% in nominal terms but decreased by 1.0% in real terms in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the fourth quarter of 2024.

  Table 1 shows the provisional figures on the GVCW performed by main contractors in the first quarter of 2025. Tables 2 and 3 show the revised figures for the whole year of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2024 respectively.

  Owing to the widespread sub-contracting practices in the construction industry, a construction establishment can be a main contractor for one contract and a sub-contractor for another contract at the same time. The GVCW performed by main contractors covers only those projects in which the construction establishment takes the role of a main contractor, but not projects in which it takes only the role of a sub-contractor. However, sub-contractors' contribution to projects should have been included in the GVCW performed by main contractors for whom they worked.

  The classification of construction establishments follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

多謝主席、各位委員。

我們今日向委員簡介推動發展休閒漁農業的各項措施的最新進展，以及政府向業界提供的支援。

政府正積極推動《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》下的各項措施，以協助業界升級轉型，邁向現代化、集約化和可持續發展，當中包括推動休閒漁農業發展。

在休閒農業方面，漁護署（漁農自然護理署）自二○二四年六月起推出了「農＋樂」農場計劃，協助主要從事商業農耕的農場提供休閒活動作為輔助業務，並在二○二五年四月進一步放寬計劃下的安排。

在休閒漁業方面，我們現時有休閒垂釣魚排，也有內陸休閒魚場。為進一步推動休閒漁業發展，漁護署計劃在今年第三季推出「漁＋樂」魚場計劃。參加計劃的魚排／內陸魚場可提供的休閒輔助活動，除了休閒垂釣外，也包括售賣自家養殖的漁產品，售賣以無火煮食方式製作以自家漁產品為主的菜式，以及舉辦與漁業教育有關的活動等。另外，為協助捕撈漁民轉型發展休閒漁業，漁護署與海事處亦正探討允許漁船作一船兩用的可行性，並會適時諮詢持份者。

今日我們在此作階段性匯報，我們會繼續透過創造有利條件，包括在法例法規方面拆牆鬆綁，為漁農民提供培訓、財政和技術支援，以及加強宣傳推廣，以協助業界發展休閒漁農業。

接下來，我請漁護署助理署長朱振華博士用投影片介紹討論文件。隨後歡迎各委員提問。多謝各位。"

蔣東強先生（中電控股首席執行官）、吳局長（廣州市商務局副局長吳偉華）、各位立法會議員、中電和航運界的朋友：

今日大家在此濟濟一堂，我衷心再次多謝中電源動特別為這次活動舉辦一個正式典禮，我很高興聯同我的團隊一同參加。正如剛才蔣先生提到，特區政府推出《綠色船用燃料加注行動綱領》（《行動綱領》）後，得到很多業界的支持和響應。

今年二月十四日的情人節，我很記得這個日子，我們首次在海上錨地完成了海上液化天然氣（LNG）加注，給予大家信心。我記得當日的天氣有一些不能預計的情況，但都能成功完成，為大家打了一支強心針。

上周在貨櫃碼頭進行首次液化天然氣加注和貨物裝卸同步作業，當時我與Frankie（立法會議員易志明）和Horace（現代貨箱碼頭集團董事總經理盧偉民）身在重慶，為大家爭貨源、拼出路、拼市場。我其實很想能夠親身參與，雖然未能身在現場，但都很關心，知道整個過程都非常順暢。我會用日子去讓我更容易記着這件事，當天是六月五日，是中國曆法廿四節氣的芒種，就讓我班門弄斧說一說，「時雨及芒種，四野皆插秧」，中電源動可能因應天氣預告而選擇了一個好日子，這詞語的意思是在當日收成第一波農作物，又為夏天來臨而陸續播種做準備，充分體現你們在六月五日的加注作業已收成了第一票貨，為往後的插秧產生了好好的啓發作用。

剛才蔣先生提到，香港作為國際航運中心，我們在船用燃料加注方面，成績非常卓越，今次活動，我們一方面為船隻卸貨，另一方面進行新能源加注，充分體現一加一大於二的協同效應。香港在加注船用燃料方面是粵港澳大灣區區內第一位、全國第二位，以及全球第七大傳統船用燃料的加注中心。這個成績其實是得來不易，我們在傳統船用燃料加注方面有一個很好的基礎，往後要打拼的是新能源加注，為減低碳排放而在航運和物流方面達至ESG（環境、社會及管治），為國際班輪公司和貨主提供綠色航運的一個選擇和方案。香港將會成為國際班輪公司、貨主和市場在綠色燃料加注、交易和同步卸貨的不二之選。

我們正非常努力地朝三個方向──包括數字化、綠色化和智慧化──去提升香港作為國際航運中心的地位，也需要業界的鼎力支持，團結一致。中電源動今次正起了一個帶領作用，統籌今次整個行動，亦有中海油（中國海洋石油）作為供應商，可見香港雖然在新能源生產或供應方面未必有相關的天然資源，但我們可以作為超級聯繫人，匯聚不同的企業，在香港產生一個蓬勃的生態圈和供應鏈。我也不是空口說白話，自我們頒布《行動綱領》後，我們的團隊和相關立法會議員與環境及生態局一直都有一些工作小組，最近也看到成績，有不少企業都有興趣，希望有一個匯聚平台，做一些企業聯繫，做成一個生態圈，以起超級聯繫人的作用。我的團隊正非常努力，相信在今個月稍後會有一些活動和儀式，到時再有好消息與大家分享，讓香港和內地相輔相成產生一個效果。

最後，我希望透過這活動和大家的廣泛宣傳，包括中電源動、中海油和現代貨箱碼頭有限公司，我們一定要踏出勇敢的第一步，用更響亮的公關宣傳方法向國際說好香港故事。香港有非常優厚的優勢，有很強的底氣，我有信心與大家攜手合作，政府願意繼續擔當一個帶領和引導的角色，在其他燃料方面，不單是液化天然氣，還有綠色甲醇和氫氣，我們今年內都會有一些實質的工作進展跟大家分享，亦希望得到大家的回饋和回報，讓我們航運中心的業務蒸蒸日上。多謝大家！"
食安中心公布第二次總膳食研究有關硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽的結果,2025-06-10 15:00,2025-06-10 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025060900503.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（六月十日）公布香港第二次總膳食研究的第二份報告。該報告就食物中的硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽含量，以及相關的膳食攝入量進行研究。結果顯示，本港整體成年人口和較年輕群組從膳食攝入硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽的分量，分別處於每日可攝入量參考範圍內和低於每日可攝入量，對一般市民的健康構成即時風險或影響的機會不大。

硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽在環境中普遍存在，亦可於動物和人體內產生。它們也會被用作食物添加劑作防腐和護色用途。硝酸鹽天然存在於植物性食物，通常以葉菜的含量最高，人類主要透過進食蔬菜攝入硝酸鹽；而亞硝酸鹽則主要來自硝酸鹽在體內轉化而成。

中心發言人說，硝酸鹽本身沒有毒性，但可被口腔中的細菌轉化為亞硝酸鹽。亞硝酸鹽可令血液中的血紅蛋白氧化成正鐵血紅蛋白，從而降低血液攜帶氧氣的能力。此外，亞硝酸鹽亦可能促成N-亞硝基化合物的形成，而部分此類化合物具有致癌性。然而，若從正常膳食中的蔬菜攝入硝酸鹽，蔬菜中的維他命C等其他生物活性物質或有助抑制內源形成N-亞硝基化合物。

根據歐洲食物安全局的評估，硝酸鹽的每日可攝入量參考範圍為每公斤體重1.05至9.4毫克。至於亞硝酸鹽，聯合國糧食及農業組織／世界衞生組織食物添加劑聯合專家委員會和歐洲食物安全局訂定的每日可攝入量同為每公斤體重0.07毫克。

這次研究共檢測187種食物的硝酸鹽和亞硝酸鹽含量，其中百分之九十七檢出硝酸鹽，百分之三十二檢出亞硝酸鹽。「蔬菜及蔬菜製品」在全部食物組別中的硝酸鹽平均含量最高，每公斤達690毫克。攝入量一般的成年人口和較年輕群組從膳食攝入的硝酸鹽絕大多數來自該食物組別，佔硝酸鹽總膳食攝入量約九成，其中單是葉菜已佔七至八成。至於亞硝酸鹽，青豆角的平均含量最高（每公斤12毫克），其次是蔬果汁、蘿蔔糕、芥蘭、椰菜和西瓜，為每公斤6.4至9.9毫克。

根據研究結果，攝入量一般和攝入量高的成年人每日從膳食攝入硝酸鹽的分量分別為每公斤體重3.8毫克和8.0毫克；較年輕群組的攝入量則分別為每公斤體重4.1毫克和8.9毫克。至於亞硝酸鹽，攝入量一般和攝入量高的成年人每日從膳食攝入亞硝酸鹽的分量分別為每公斤體重0.014至0.018毫克和0.025至0.029毫克；較年輕群組的亞硝酸鹽攝入量則分別為每公斤體重0.019至0.025毫克和每公斤體重0.038至0.045毫克。

發言人提醒市民應保持均衡飲食，每日進食最少三份蔬菜和兩份水果，並在膳食中加入更多種類的蔬菜，包括花菜、果菜、瓜菜及菇菌等。市民亦應妥善貯存和處理蔬菜，例如貯存非即時食用或出售的蔬菜在雪櫃内，烹煮前徹底清洗、按情況去皮，或以沸水烹煮代替炒菜，以減少蔬菜的硝酸鹽含量和亞硝酸鹽的形成。

香港第二次總膳食研究評估香港市民和不同人口組別從膳食攝入一些可能有潛在食物安全風險的化學物質的分量，以及評估攝入該些物質對健康帶來的風險。整項研究由二○二三年二月開始進行，預計於二○二六年年底前完成，有關其他化學物質組別的研究報告會分期公布及上載中心網頁www.cfs.gov.hk。"
CFS announces Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study findings on nitrate and nitrite,2025-06-10 15:00,2025-06-10 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025060900506.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department released the second report under the Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study today (June 10). This report examined the levels of nitrate and nitrite in food, and the associated dietary exposure. The findings showed that the dietary exposure to nitrate and nitrite among the overall adult and younger populations in Hong Kong fell within the alternative range of Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) values and below the ADI respectively, indicating the general population is unlikely to experience any immediate health risks or effects.

Nitrate and nitrite are ubiquitous in the environment and can be produced endogenously in animals and humans. They are also used as food additives for preservative and colour retention purposes. Nitrate is found naturally in plant-based foods, with the highest concentrations typically found in leafy vegetables. Human exposure to nitrate mainly comes from consumption of vegetables, while exposure to nitrite mostly results from endogenous conversion from nitrate.

A spokesman for the CFS said that nitrate itself is relatively non-toxic, but it can be converted into nitrite by bacteria in the mouth. Nitrite can oxidise haemoglobin into methaemoglobin in the blood, reducing its oxygen-carrying capacity. Nitrite may also contribute to the formation of N-nitroso compounds, some of which are carcinogenic. However, when nitrate is consumed through a normal diet containing vegetables, other bioactive substances in vegetables, such as vitamin C, may inhibit the endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds.

According to an evaluation conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the alternative range of ADI values estimated for nitrate is 1.05 to 9.4 milligrams/kilogram body weight (bw)/day. The Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives and the EFSA established the same ADI for nitrite, which is 0.07mg/kg bw/day.

Out of a total of 187 food items tested for nitrate and nitrite levels in the Study, nitrate was detected in 97 per cent of the items, while 32 per cent were found to contain nitrite. Among all food groups, ""Vegetables and their products"" had the highest mean concentration of nitrate, at 690mg/kg. For average consumers of the adult and younger populations, the vast majority of dietary sources of nitrate came from this food group, accounting for about 90 per cent of the total dietary exposure to nitrate. Among these, leafy vegetables alone contributed 70 to 80 per cent of the total daily nitrate exposure. As for nitrite, green string beans were detected with the highest mean concentration of nitrite (12mg/kg), followed by fruit and/or vegetable juice, turnip cake, Chinese kale, European variety cabbage and watermelon, with mean concentrations ranging from 6.4 to 9.9mg/kg.

According to the findings, the estimated dietary exposure to nitrate was 3.8 and 8.0mg/kg bw/day for average and high consumers of the adult population respectively. For the younger population, the estimated dietary exposure to nitrate was 4.1 and 8.9mg/kg bw/day for average and high consumers respectively. Regarding nitrite, the estimated dietary exposure was 0.014 to 0.018mg/kg bw/day and 0.025 to 0.029mg/kg bw/day for average and high consumers of the adult population respectively. For the younger population, the estimated dietary exposure to nitrite was 0.019 to 0.025mg/kg bw/day and 0.038 to 0.045mg/kg bw/day for average and high consumers respectively.

The spokesman reminded members of the public to maintain a balanced diet, consume at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruits every day and incorporate a greater variety of vegetables into their diet, including flowerhead brassica vegetables, fruiting vegetables, mushrooms and fungus. The public is also advised to store and prepare vegetables properly to reduce nitrate levels and minimise nitrite formation. For example, keep vegetables under refrigeration if not consumed or sold immediately, wash vegetables thoroughly and peel them as appropriate before cooking, or boil vegetables in water rather than stir-fry.

The Second Hong Kong Total Diet Study aims to estimate the latest dietary exposure of the Hong Kong population and various population subgroups to some chemical substances of potential food safety concern, and assess the associated health risks. The Study commenced in February 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. The reports of other groups of chemical substances will be released in phases and uploaded to the CFS webpage at www.cfs.gov.hk."

Special offers announced in celebration of HKSAR's 28th anniversary,2025-06-10 13:18,2025-06-10 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000270.htm,"  To celebrate the 28th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on July 1, the Government and different sectors of the community will launch a rich array of special offers and activities, covering areas including public transport; culture, arts and leisure; as well as dining and consumption, to share with members of the public the joy of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.

Remarks by CE at media session before ExCo (with video),2025-06-10 13:15,2025-06-10 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000388.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at a media session before the Executive Council meeting today (June 10):

Reporter: Good morning Mr Lee. So you have chaired a senior meeting and instructed officials to follow up in response to the fresh water supply to housing estates in Fanling. What do you think the Government can learn from this incident, and are there any areas that should be improved on? And secondly, with Aristo Sham being the first Hong Kong-born pianist to win the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, what does his win mean, in your opinion, and are there any plans to take this opportunity, perhaps, to review support to the industry? Thank you.

Chief Executive: In dealing with water matters, we have to ensure not just that it is safe to drink, but also that people drink it with their mind at ease. I'm highly concerned about the water matter in Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court, and that is why I held a meeting and gave four directives and 10 tasks for the relevant bureaux and departments to implement. I repeat the four directives: to trace the source; to set up an expert group to assist in the tracing; to immediately install and strengthen the filtration facilities in each and every building in Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court; and to speed up the work.

 In regard to the 10 tasks, I don't want to repeat here, because they have been well announced. And I've also asked the Deputy Financial Secretary, Michael Wong, to oversee the implementation. I see the 10 specific tasks are being implemented fast and immediately. During the past weekend, colleagues deployed additional manpower on-site to speed up the work progress. The latest progress of key areas has received positive feedback from residents. For example, we have visited a lot of households that have previously made complaints about the water quality, and from them –and from the sample water we've collected – they've indicated that they no longer see any particles in the water. They find the water clean, and they feel at ease to drink the water.

 We have also enhanced manpower at the district level to talk to people who may still have problems. This includes government officials, care teams, District Council members and the different representatives who are willing to join the government team to visit households and also talk to the different people to address their concerns. And I'm glad to hear that they have been receiving positive feedback that those who previously complained about the particles they have reported, they no longer see those particles. There may be one or two households that still reported that they had seen particles, but after flushing and some work to the taps and also cleaning the water meter, there is very clear improvement. We'll continue the work. Experience suggests that some particles or residue may remain in the pipes after entering into the building. In other words, in the same building, we're seeing a lot of households saying the water is clean – they don't see any particles anymore – but there may be one or two that still see some small particles. So these particles stay in internal pipes, probably within the households or probably within the taps or the water meter. Government colleagues are working hard to do all they can to continue to flush the pipes, flush the tap, flush the water meter. And I advise residents, they can do the same, but we'll do our best. And what is also very important is good dissemination of information, and we have been publishing the results every day on the website, and also posting the notice at the entrance of all buildings.

 I think the experience that colleagues have learned from this incident is, response should be fast. We should understand the feelings of residents in water concerns to ensure that it's not just safe, but that when they drink the water, their mind is at ease. Colleagues, of course, focus on the technical side of ensuring the water is safe. I think everybody handling this matter knows that we should, at the same time, address residents' ease of mind when we deal with water problem. And I've also instructed the Water Supplies Department to replace the pipes which are the source of the particles. They're working hard on it. My thanks to the support and advice of the expert team which has been formed, they are more or less formulating the plan to replace the pipes which are the source of the problem as soon as possible, and the Water Supplies Department will submit the plan to the Development Bureau as soon as possible.

 As regards the very good news of Aristo Sham having won the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, which is one of the highest levels of piano competitions, and Mr Aristo Sham, being born in Hong Kong – we are so proud of him, and we are so glad that he has won the competition. I think every Hong Kong resident feels proud of this excellent result. And of course, if Aristo will find time to make a few performances in Hong Kong, it will really get us even more excited and we will see if that will happen, but we'll work hard to see whether we can make it happen.

 I'm very glad that overall, the performances of a lot of artists from Hong Kong are doing well in different areas, and this is seen in a lot of good results they have achieved. The present mechanism for the Government to support performers in this field of art is through the Hong Kong Arts Development Council, and they will be looking closely at the needs to strengthen opportunities for different areas of art so as to develop talent, to develop the overall performances of those who are interested in different areas. There is an expert group, actually, in the Arts Development Council to look at the overall situation and the different areas, strengths and potentials, to examine assistance and support, including donations or subsidies in the area of developing different arts. So the mechanism is there and we will continue to make good use of the Arts Development Council to help artists in different areas to achieve their goals and realise their dreams. Thank you.

行政長官於行政會議前會見傳媒開場發言及答問內容（附短片）,2025-06-10 13:15,2025-06-10 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000389.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（六月十日）上午出席行政會議前會見傳媒的開場發言及答問內容：

行政長官：大家早晨。我宣布二○二五年《施政報告》將會於九月公布。公眾諮詢將會在下星期一，即六月十六日，正式展開。我今年較過往提前於九月發表《施政報告》，是因為今年年底會舉行立法會換屆選舉，今屆立法會會期會提早結束。提前展開今年《施政報告》的公眾諮詢，是因為我重視行政立法溝通和互動的重要性，同時讓政府有充份的時間聽取市民和社會各界的意見和建議。

我上任近三年，努力改變政府文化，建立以結果為目標的政府，推動政府工作步伐加快，主動做事。我和團隊願意聽取社會意見，令我們的措施更對接市民的需求。

去年發表的第三份《施政報告》，在不同範疇推出了共600多項政策措施，深化我上任以來的各項改革。各項措施正不斷推展，在守正創新、求進求變的同時，進一步提升和發揮香港的成功元素。

百年未見的大變局正加速演進，地緣政治錯綜複雜，保護主義、單邊主義抬頭，貿易秩序受到破壞，供應鏈受到威脅。香港面對不同挑戰，但有危亦有機。香港的機遇始終大於挑戰，香港在「一國兩制」下同時享有國家機遇和國際機遇，而國家的不斷發展更是香港的最大機遇和最強後盾。

香港經濟仍然正面擴張，今年的生產總值估計有百分之二至三的正增長。同時香港正進入經濟轉型期，有些行業會表現不錯，有些行業會面對挑戰，政府和各行業都要識變、應變、求變。我們要通過創新創造，發掘新增長點，開拓新市場、新藍海，深化國際交往合作，做大做深區域合作，全力拼經濟，謀發展，改善民生。

我和團隊將出席超過40場線上線下的諮詢會和兩場地區諮詢會，廣泛聽取不同人士的意見，包括專業界別、地區組織、政黨、不同市民等。我們會走進社區，親身接觸不同階層，聽取他們的想法。

另外，三個星期後的七月一日，就是香港回歸祖國暨特區成立二十八周年的大日子。特區政府會在全港18區舉辦百多項慶祝活動，包括升旗禮、步操匯演、嘉年華、綜藝晚會、球類比賽等多項項目。

政府和不同行業亦會推出多元化的優惠，讓巿民與親友歡渡這個喜慶日子。

第一，公共交通優惠：

＊港鐵在七月一日會以抽獎形式送出71 000張電子車票，中獎市民半年內可以任選日子，免費乘搭一程指定路線的本地車程。當日，機場快線3至11歲小童免費，60歲或以上市民半價乘搭。

＊七一當日，市民可免費乘搭天星小輪來往尖沙咀和灣仔，以及用免費乘船券乘搭五條新渡輪和富裕小輪的航線。

＊市民更可以由七月一日起連續三日免費乘搭電車。

第二，多個政府場地免費及海洋公園等提供優惠：

＊康樂及文化事務署多項室內和戶外康樂設施、科學館及太空館的常設展覽、香港濕地公園、西九文化區M+標準票的所有展覽，以及香港故宮文化博物館所有專題展覽，在七月一日全部一律免費開放。

＊香港海洋公園推出成人門票優惠，在七月三日或之前到香港海洋公園，二人同行八折，三至四人同行七折。

＊七一當日，昂坪360小童及長者來回標準纜車門票二八折，山頂纜車來回優惠套票八五折。

第三，飲食及購物優惠：

＊飲食業界鼎力支持慶祝回歸，將有超過1 000間食肆和商戶在七一提供指定菜式及餐飲品優惠。

＊食物環境衞生署（食環署）四個街市——東日街市、香港仔街市、荔灣街市、天幕街市，以及香港房屋委員會商場「共築・創業家」店鋪、油塘大本型均會推出優惠或派發禮品。

＊由七月一日至七日，在「本地魚菜直送」網店或手機app（應用程式）購買魚類統營處和蔬菜統營處特定產品，有七一折。

＊七月一日到環境保護署「綠在區區」回收，「綠綠賞」積分雙倍。

＊今年有更多企業推出七一優惠，包括多間商場、百貨公司、國貨公司，連同香港國際機場、香港科學園、數碼港商場等，提供一系列購物、餐飲、消費或泊車優惠。

＊在六月底至八月，香港旅遊發展局與多個商戶合作，推出餐飲、購物、景點、旅遊和娛樂優惠，讓市民和遊客玩得盡興。

政府今日稍後會公布各項優惠和活動的詳情，相關部門和機構亦會繼續更新相關資訊。

我感謝社會各界積極響應，為市民提供不同優惠和多元慶祝活動。我鼓勵並相信更多機構會參與其中，讓整個香港和市民共同熱烈慶祝香港回歸祖國二十八周年的大日子。多謝大家。

記者：特首，你好。第一，想問食肆等場所牌照的新規定，即是作出不利國安或者香港公眾利益的冒犯行為會被「釘牌」。想請問如何定義？做法是否針對所謂的「黃店」？以及想問問是否如湯家驊所說，用粗口罵領導人或者國家就會可能被「釘牌」？如果食肆貼「香港加油」，或者諷刺政府的字眼其實又是否可以呢？第二，消息說夏寶龍主任今個月會訪港，想問特首知否是哪一日到來？來多少天？知否夏寶龍今次訪港目的是甚麼？會否督促特區提速改革，尤其是北部都會區的發展？多謝。

行政長官：食環署在新簽發及續期牌照時加入有關維護國家安全的條款，防範和制止不利國家安全的行為，是履行維護國家安全的法律責任和義務，是恰當亦應該的。

根據《中華人民共和國憲法》，所有公民有義務維護國家安全。香港作為中國特區，市民有義務維護國家安全。根據《香港國安法》，香港行政機關有責任維護國家安全。

根據《維護國家安全條例》（《條例》），任何機構，組織和個人，都應當遵守特區維護國家安全所適用的法律。根據《條例》第8條，凡特區法律授予某人任何職能，任何人在作出執行該職能上的任何決定時，須將國家安全視為最重要的因素，並據此給予適當考慮。即是食環署按《條例》的第8條，香港的法律給予食環署職能，食環署人員在行使其職能作任何決定時，應該將國家安全視為最重要的元素而適當考慮。

所以有關的條款，已經在新增持牌條件中清楚解釋，食環署在處理新牌照或續牌申請時，會依法行事。有關條款亦在食環署的場地租約及簽發的牌照中，包括年宵攤檔和公眾娛樂場所等適用。

安全是一切發展的基石，所以我們會繼續不斷完善維護國家安全的法律和執行機制。至於在條文中提及的冒犯行為，在條款中已清晰闡釋。冒犯行為是任何構成或者導致危害國家安全的罪行，又或不利於國家安全和香港公眾利益的一些行為或者活動，是很清晰的。

另外，有關中央港澳辦、國務院港澳辦主任夏寶龍先生，他對於香港的所有事情都非常關心，而且他亦很重視去了解香港不同方面的實際情況，所以他曾經兩次來到香港調研考察，包括在二○二三年和二○二四年，每一次我都陪伴夏主任在調研考察接觸不同市民、不同人士代表等。所得出的結果都是相當好，第一，社會反應很正面；第二，夏主任表示他更加了解香港的實際情況，亦通過直接與不同代表溝通對話，掌握到大家對整體香港社會發展的一些感覺和意見。

夏主任關心香港，如果有甚麼信息關於夏主任在香港的活動，我們會適時發放，到時大家就會知道實際情況會是如何。多謝。

記者：你好，特首。想問《施政報告》方面，今年的主題會聚焦甚麼？跟以往有甚麼不同？過去一年，你定下138個KPI（關鍵績效指標），目前進度如何？是否已經全部完成？或者會否有機會在新一份《施政報告》提點某一位司局長盡快完成工作？另一方面問網約車和的士業界的爭議，有的士業界認為，如果政府願意以每個牌照500萬收回的士牌，就可以解決網約車規管的爭議，政府是否同意？或者會否真的考慮收回所有的士牌？謝謝。

行政長官：我每年都會在《施政報告》定下不同指標，不同部門在這些KPI下的表現均符合我的要求。我亦不斷檢視每個部門在訂下的指標內的工作進度。在公布《施政報告》時，我會整體向大家報告這方面的情況。目前來說，部門是達標的。

我多次強調，現時政府的施政方針是拼經濟、謀發展、改善民生，所以《施政報告》的範圍一定是朝着這三方面。《施政報告》亦會重點考慮如何強化香港一些既有優勢，如何把握好機遇，還有如何處理風險。整體來說，我上任後已經在多方面進行改革。在深化改革方面，我是重視的。在諮詢過程中，我全方位歡迎任何人在不同領域提供意見，因為《施政報告》所涵蓋的範圍都是市民和社會關心的問題，所以我希望在所有不同範圍都聽取意見。市民亦無須從我的角度考慮我的重點。如果你有考慮，我很感謝，你可以在重點方面提供意見，但市民自身有何想法、意見和需求，我亦很希望聽取他們的意見。我過去的經驗是，經過不同的諮詢會，特別是兩場地區諮詢會跟市民直接交流，亦會在落區時聽市民意見，都有一個很好的互動和交流，這個我們會努力做。我們整個團隊都很樂意聽取不同意見。

另外，有關的士的問題，我留意到相關報道。動用任何公帑，必須極度謹慎。市民對於的士服務未達要求，有很多聲音，有很多意見，的士業界必須重視。的士牌照給予的士經營特權，包括專為的士而設的的士站，只供的士使用；的士亦可以到達指定禁區接載乘客，也可隨時接載「街客」上車。這些是牌照長期容許的士使用的特權，令牌照有直接回報，亦令的士長期在經營下獲利。

的士服務同樣有社會價值，在改善服務的大前提下，的士應該繼續存在，但網約車是世界趨勢，而且這個趨勢在一些城市或地區，網約車已發展得相當成熟，我相信亦是一個不能逆轉的趨勢。因此，政府考慮利用法律方法，設立法律框架，立法規管網約平台，提供網約的士和其他點對點車輛的合法合規服務，同時保障乘客安全，亦讓的士更好發展，尤其是鼓勵車隊在網約平台的發展，提升的士管理，從而提升的士服務。法例亦會明確訂明甚麼點對點車輛屬違法，運輸及物流局已經馬不停蹄、盡快研究這方面的所有細節，最後會公布細節。我們希望屆時不論社會還是立法會都會充分討論，幫助我們在這方面完善法律，規管網約車，令無論是網約的士或其他點對點網約車輛服務均在合法、保障乘客安全的情況下進行。多謝大家。
