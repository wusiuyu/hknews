政府首八個月（即截至二○二五年十一月三十日）的財務狀況,2025-12-31 16:30,2025-12-31 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100443.htm,"政府今日（十二月三十一日）公布本財政年度首八個月（即截至二○二五年十一月三十日）的財務狀況。

本財政年度首八個月的整體開支及收入分別為4,966億港元及3,719億港元。計入發行政府債券所得1,352億港元及償還政府債券285億港元的本金後，本財政年度首八個月錄得180億港元赤字。

政府發言人表示，截至十一月份的赤字較十月份減少，主要是由於薪俸稅及利得稅等主要收入均大多在財政年度的後期收取。本財政年度的修訂預算將與二○二六至二七年度《財政預算案》同時公布。

財政儲備在二○二五年十一月三十日為6,363億港元。

Expenditure and revenue from April to November 2025 amounted to HK$496.6 billion and HK$371.9 billion respectively, resulting in a deficit of HK$18 billion after taking into account HK$135.2 billion received from issuance of Government Bonds and repayment of HK$28.5 billion principal on Government Bonds.

A Government spokesperson said that the deficit for the period ended November 2025 was lower than that ended October 2025, mainly due to the fact that some major types of revenue including salaries and profits taxes are mostly received towards the end of a financial year. The revised estimates for the current financial year will be published along with the 2026-27 Budget.

The fiscal reserves stood at HK$636.3 billion as at November 30, 2025.

海關透過情報分析及風險評估，發現不法分子意圖利用遠洋船走私貨物，遂部署執法行動，鎖定一個原定由香港出發經遠洋船運往馬來西亞的可疑貨櫃進行查驗。

海關於十二月二十三日檢查上述報稱載有金屬、伺服器板、印刷電路板、硬盤、電線等的貨櫃。經查驗後，海關人員在貨櫃內檢獲一批懷疑走私貨物，包括集成電路、電阻和散熱器。

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected smuggled goods worth about $7 million (with photos),2025-12-31 16:15,2025-12-31 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100453.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected a suspected smuggling case involving an ocean-going vessel on December 23. A batch of suspected smuggled goods with a total estimated market value of about $7 million was seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, Customs discovered that criminals intended to use ocean-going vessels to smuggle goods. Enforcement operations were thus formulated, with a suspicious container scheduled to depart from Hong Kong to Malaysia via an ocean-going vessel being selected for inspection.

Customs inspected the abovementioned container that was declared as carrying metals, server boards, printed circuit boards, hard drives, wires, etc, on December 23. Upon examination, Customs officers found a batch of suspected smuggled goods, including integrated circuits, resistors and heat sinks, in the container.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Being a government department primarily responsible for tackling smuggling activities, Customs has long been combating various smuggling activities on all fronts. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to disrupt relevant crimes.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

香港金融管理局今日（十二月三十一日）發表的統計數字顯示，認可機構的存款總額在二○二五年十一月份上升0.7%，其中港元存款及外幣存款分別上升0.2%及1.1%。由年初截至十一月底計，存款總額及港元存款分別上升10.5%及3.4%。香港人民幣存款在十一月份上升0.6%，於十一月底為10,020億元人民幣。跨境貿易結算的人民幣匯款總額於十一月份為10,330億元人民幣，而十月份為10,066億元人民幣。存款變動受多項因素影響，包括利率走勢、市場集資活動等，因此適宜觀察較長期趨勢，毋須過度解讀個別月份的波動。

十一月份貸款與墊款總額上升0.1%，由年初截至十一月底計上升1.0%。其中在香港使用的貸款（包括貿易融資）在十一月份下跌0.1%，在香港境外使用的貸款在十一月份則上升0.4%。由於港元存款上升而港元貸款下跌，港元貸存比率由十月底的73.6%，下跌至十一月底的73.2%。

十一月份港元貨幣供應量M2及M3均上升0.2%，與去年同期比較均上升4.5%。十一月份經季節因素調整的港元貨幣供應量M1上升1.2%，與去年同期比較上升14.9%，部分反映投資相關活動。貨幣供應量總額M2及M3於十一月份均上升0.9%，與去年同期比較，M2及M3均上升11.2%。

由於按月貨幣統計數字或會受到各種短期因素（例如季節性的資金需求，以及營商與投資相關活動）影響而出現波動，因此應小心詮釋統計數字。"
Exchange Fund Abridged Balance Sheet and Currency Board Account,2025-12-31 16:00,2025-12-31 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100275.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (December 31) that the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$4,106.9billion as at November 30, 2025, HK$10.7 billion lower than that at the end of October 2025. Foreign currency assets decreased by HK$9.9 billion and Hong Kong dollar assets decreased by HK$0.8 billion.

The decline in foreign currency assets was mainly due to a reduction in the month-end balances of unsettled purchase of securities, which was partly offset by proceeds from the issuance of Digital Green Bonds and RMB Institutional Government Bonds, interest income and mark-to-market revaluation of investments. The decline in Hong Kong dollar assets was mainly due to mark-to-market revaluation of Hong Kong equities.

The Currency Board Account shows that the Monetary Base at the end of November 2025 was HK$2,032.2 billion, increased by HK$5.5 billion, or 0.3per cent, from the end of October 2025. The increase was mainly due to increases in the market value of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes outstanding and the outstanding amount of Certificates of Indebtedness.

The amount of Backing Assets increased by HK$14.2 billion, or 0.6per cent, to HK$2,241.3 billion at the end of November 2025. The increase was mainly attributable to interest income and mark-to-market revaluation of investments. The Backing Ratio increased from 109.89per cent at the end ofOctober 2025to110.29per cent at the end of November 2025.

Monetary Statistics for November 2025,2025-12-31 16:00,2025-12-31 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100304.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

According to statistics published today (December 31) by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, total deposits with authorized institutions increased by 0.7 per cent in November 2025. Among the total, Hong Kong dollar deposits and foreign currency deposits increased by 0.2per cent and 1.1per cent respectively in November. In the year to end-November, total deposits and Hong Kong dollar deposits increased by 10.5per cent and 3.4per cent respectively. Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong increased by 0.6per cent in November to RMB1,002.0 billion at the end of November. The total remittance of renminbi for cross-border trade settlement amounted to RMB1,033.0 billion in November, compared with RMB1,006.6 billion in October. It should be noted that changes in deposits are affected by a wide range of factors, such as interest rate movements and fund-raising activities. It is therefore more appropriate to observe the longer-term trends, and not to over-generalise fluctuations in a single month.

Total loans and advances increased by 0.1per cent in November, and increased by 1.0per cent in the year to end-November. Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong (including trade finance) decreased by 0.1per cent while loans for use outside Hong Kong increased by 0.4per cent in November. The Hong Kong dollar loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 73.2per cent at the end of November from 73.6per cent at the end of October, as Hong Kong dollar deposits increased while Hong Kong dollar loans decreased.

Hong Kong dollar M2 and M3 both increased by 0.2per cent in November, and both increased by 4.5per cent when compared to a year ago. The seasonally-adjusted Hong Kong dollar M1 increased by 1.2per cent in November, and increased by 14.9per cent compared to a year ago, reflecting in part investment-related activities. Total M2 and total M3 both increased by 0.9per cent in November. Compared to a year earlier, total M2 and total M3 both increased by 11.2per cent.

As monthly monetary statistics are subject to volatilities due to a wide range of transient factors, such as seasonal funding demand as well as business and investment-related activities, caution is required when interpreting the statistics."

Results of Survey on Professional and Business Services relating to Intellectual Property Trading/Commercialisation released,2025-12-31 16:00,2025-12-31 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100239.htm," The Intellectual Property Department (IPD) announced today (December 31) the results of the Survey on Professional and Business Services relating to Intellectual Property Trading/Commercialisation for 2024, which showed that local manpower with high academic or professional qualifications forms a dynamic and growing talent pool in support of the provision of a variety of professional and business services relating to intellectual property (IP) trading and commercialisation (collectively referred to as IP services). IP services concern the identification, protection, management and commercialisation of IP rights, including trade marks, patents, registered designs, copyright and other rights.

 The Director of Intellectual Property, Mr David Wong, said, ""With the support of the Central Government, Hong Kong has been fully committed to developing into a regional IP trading centre. Hong Kong's pool of experienced IP service professionals is a key to safeguarding the legitimate interests of parties to IP transactions and the successful promotion of IP commercialisation. The Survey indicated that at least one-third of the establishments providing IP services collaborated with counterparts outside Hong Kong (notably on the Chinese Mainland and overseas) in their daily business. Our IP services providers are team players in both the local and global IP communities, playing the dual roles of 'super connector' and 'super value-adder' by leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantage of enjoying the strong support of the motherland and staying closely connected to the world.""

 The Survey was commissioned by the IPD to collect information on the local landscape of the provision of IP services. During the period from May to October this year, the survey successfully enumerated 751 establishments, of which 266 provided IP services during the year of 2024. It was estimated that as at the end 2024, the number of people in Hong Kong's workforce who engaged in IP services was about 4 148, up about 10 per cent from the manpower survey conducted by the IPD in 2017. Almost 80 per cent of the IP practitioners had a bachelor's degree or higher qualification, and about 70 per cent thereof possessed relevant academic and/or professional qualifications.

 In 2024, the establishments most frequently provided ""IP registration services"" (84.1 per cent) and ""IP consultation and/or advisory services"" (79.5 per cent), which accounted for the highest percentage of their income in IP services. Amongst various IP rights, ""trade marks"" (92.4 per cent) and ""patents"" (48 per cent) were most often involved in the IP services rendered and were the categories that generated the largest business receipts.

 The considerable business opportunities brought about by the high-quality development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-MacaoGreater Bay Area (GBA) also foster co-operation in IP services in the region. In 2024, about a quarter (25.7 per cent) of the establishments providing IP services in Hong Kong also provided IP services in or concerning the GBA (other than Hong Kong itself), also mostly in respect of ""IP registration services"" (85.4 per cent) and ""IP consultation and/or advisory services"" (66.7 per cent). Likewise, ""trade marks"" (96.1 per cent) and ""patents"" (50.3 per cent) were the two major types of IP rights involved in these IP services. Furthermore, nearly 30 per cent of the establishments providing IP services in Hong Kong indicated that they would consider starting to provide IP services concerning other parts of the GBA or expand their IP services business to other parts of the GBA in the next two years, indicating their active participation in driving the economic growth of GBA.

 The Survey further collected the views of the establishments providing IP services on the major challenges they faced in enhancing IP services in Hong Kong, and they generally see the need for nurturing more talent with sufficient IP knowledge and experience.

 Mr Wong said that the IPD will continue pressing ahead with supporting initiatives on various fronts to build a robust ecosystem to enhance Hong Kong's position as a regional IP trading centre.

 Members of the public are welcome to browse the summary of survey results uploaded to the website of the IPD."

外匯基金資產負債表摘要及貨幣發行局帳目,2025-12-31 16:00,2025-12-31 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100278.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十二月三十一日）公布，截至二○二五年十一月三十日，外匯基金總資產為41,069億港元，較二○二五年十月底減少107億港元，其中外幣資產減少99億港元，港元資產減少8億港元。

外幣資產減少，主要是因為已購入但未結算證券的月底餘額減少，但有關減幅因發行數碼綠色債券及人民幣特區政府機構債券所得的款項、來自投資的利息收入及投資按市價重估而被部分抵銷。港元資產減少，主要是因為香港股票按市價重估。

貨幣發行局帳目顯示，二○二五年十一月底的貨幣基礎為20,322億港元，較二○二五年十月底增加55億港元，增幅為0.3%。貨幣基礎增加，主要是由於未償還外匯基金票據及債券的市值增加及負債證明書總額有所上升。

二○二五年十一月底的支持資產總額增加142億港元至22,413億港元，增幅為0.6%。支持資產增加，主要是因為來自投資的利息收入及投資按市價重估。支持比率由二○二五年十月底的109.89%，上升至二○二五年十一月底的110.29%。

與知識產權貿易／商品化相關的專業及商業服務統計調查公布結果,2025-12-31 16:00,2025-12-31 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100240.htm,"知識產權署今日（十二月三十一日）公布「2024年與知識產權貿易／商品化相關的專業及商業服務統計調查」結果，顯示香港擁有由具高學歷或專業資格的人士組成、充滿活力且不斷增長的人才庫，能為知識產權貿易和商品化提供各類的專業和商業服務（統稱為知識產權服務）。知識產權服務涉及知識產權（包括商標、專利、註冊外觀設計、版權和其他權利）的識別、保護、管理和商品化。

知識產權署署長黃福來說：「在中央政府的支持下，香港致力發展成為區域知識產權貿易中心。香港匯聚經驗豐富的知識產權服務人才，能保障知識產權貿易各方的合法權益，是促進知識產權商品化的成功關鍵。調查結果顯示至少三分之一提供知識產權服務的機構與香港以外的同行（尤其是內地和海外的合作夥伴）合作，進行日常業務。無論在本地或全球的知識產權服務業界，我們的服務提供者都積極發揮團隊合作精神，利用香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，當好『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的雙重角色。」

調查由知識產權署委託進行，旨在收集本地知識產權服務的資訊。調查在今年五月至十月期間成功訪問751間機構，其中266間機構在二○二四年提供知識產權服務。據估計，於二○二四年年底香港勞動人口中從事知識產權服務的人數約為4 148人，較知識產權署於二○一七年進行人力統計調查時增加約10%。近80%的知識產權從業者擁有學士學位或以上學歷，其中約70%擁有相關的學術及／或專業資格。

在二○二四年，機構最常提供「知識產權註冊服務」（84.1%）和「知識產權顧問及／或諮詢服務」（79.5%），兩者在相關機構的知識產權業務收益中亦佔最高的百分比。有關知識產權服務最常涉及的知識產權類別是「商標」（92.4%）和「專利」（48.0%），兩者亦是帶來最大業務收益的類別。

粵港澳大灣區的高質量發展所帶來的龐大商機，亦促進了區內知識產權服務合作。二○二四年，在香港提供知識產權服務的機構中約有四分之一（25.7%）亦同時在大灣區內（香港以外）提供知識產權服務，或提供與大灣區（香港以外）有關的知識產權服務，其中大部分與「知識產權註冊服務」（85.4%）和「知識產權顧問及／或諮詢服務」（66.7%）有關。同樣地，「商標」（96.1%）和「專利」（50.3%）是這些知識產權服務最常涉及的類別。此外，在香港提供知識產權服務的機構中有接近30%表示會考慮在未來兩年內開始提供與大灣區（香港以外）相關的知識產權服務或把知識產權業務擴展至大灣區的其他地方，顯示它們對推動大灣區的經濟增長的積極參與。

調查進一步收集提供知識產權服務機構的意見，了解它們在提升香港知識產權服務時所面臨的主要挑戰，有關機構普遍認為需要培養更多具備充分知識產權知識和經驗的人才。

黃福來表示，知識產權署將繼續推行不同的支援措施，以構建一個健全的生態系統，提升香港作為區域知識產權貿易中心的地位。

調查結果摘要已上載至知識產權署網頁，歡迎參閲。"

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由十二月三十日中午截至今日（十二月三十一日）中午，食安中心已對339個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對50個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

由二○二三年八月二十四日起至今日中午，食安中心及漁護署分別檢測了共193 062個日本進口食物樣本（包括124 668個水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽樣本）及共42 716個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 30 to noon today (December 31), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 339 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 193 062 samples of food imported from Japan (including 124 668 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 42 716 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

中心發言人表示，中心對約一千八百個食物樣本作微生物檢測，約四千四百個樣本進行化學及輻射水平檢測。

微生物檢測包括致病原及衞生情況指標，化學檢測則包括除害劑、防腐劑、金屬雜質、染色料及獸藥殘餘等。輻射水平檢測包括從不同地區進口的食品中抽取樣本測試放射性銫和碘的含量。

檢測樣本包括約一千七百個蔬菜、水果及其製品樣本；約四百個穀類及穀類製品樣本；約七百個肉類、家禽及其製品樣本；約九百個奶類、奶類製品及冰凍甜點樣本；約九百個水產及其製品樣本；和約一千六百個其他類別的食物樣本（包括飲品、烘焙食品及零食等）。

三個不合格樣本分別為一個可能受黃曲霉毒素污染的預先包裝開心果醬樣本；一個驗出孔雀石綠的大頭魚樣本；和一個驗出沙門氏菌的切開水果樣本。

中心已跟進以上不合格樣本，包括通知涉事商戶有關化驗結果、指令有關商戶停售相關問題食物和追查問題食物來源等。

發言人提醒業界應確保其提供的食物適宜供人食用和符合法例要求，消費者則應光顧可靠的商鋪及保持均衡飲食，以減低風險。

此外，因應日本政府在福島核電站排放核污水，中心會繼續加強對日本進口食品的檢測，並會按風險評估的結果適時調整相關監測工作；中心亦會在每個工作天於專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/daily_japan_nuclear_incidents.html）公布有關日本進口食品樣本的輻射檢測結果，讓業界和市民掌握相關最新安全資訊。"

CFS announces food safety report for November,2025-12-31 15:00,2025-12-31 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100149.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (December 31) released the findings of its food safety report for last month. The results of about 6 200 food samples tested (including food items purchased online) were found to be satisfactory except for three unsatisfactory samples that were announced earlier. The overall satisfactory rate was 99.9 per cent.

A CFS spokesman said that about 1 800 food samples were collected for microbiological tests, and about 4 400 samples were taken for chemical and radiation level tests.

The microbiological tests covered pathogens and hygiene indicators; the chemical tests included testing for pesticides, preservatives, metallic contaminants, colouring matters, veterinary drug residues and others; and the radiation-level tests included testing for radioactive caesium and iodine in samples collected from imported food from different regions.

The samples comprised about 1 700 samples of vegetables and fruit and their products; about 400 samples of cereals, grains and their products; about 700 samples of meat and poultry and their products; about 900 samples of milk, milk products and frozen confections; about 900 samples of aquatic and related products; and about 1 600 samples of other food commodities (including beverages, bakery products and snacks).

The three unsatisfactory samples comprised a prepackaged pistachio paste sample suspected to be contaminated with aflatoxin; a bighead carp sample found with malachite green; and a cut fruits sample found with Salmonella.

The CFS has taken follow-up actions on the above-mentioned unsatisfactory samples, including informing the vendors concerned of the test results, instructing them to stop selling the affected food items, and tracing the sources of the food items in question.

The spokesman reminded the food trade to ensure that food is fit for human consumption and meets legal requirements. Consumers should patronise reliable shops when buying food and maintain a balanced diet to minimise food risks.

Separately, in response to the Japanese Government's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the CFS will continue enhancing the testing on imported Japanese food, and make reference to the risk assessment results to adjust relevant surveillance work in a timely manner. The CFS will announce every working day on its dedicated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/daily_japan_nuclear_incidents.html) the radiological test results of the samples of food imported from Japan, with a view to enabling the trade and members of the public to have a better grasp of the latest safety information."

政府更新香港《生物多樣性策略及行動計劃》,2025-12-31 12:12,2025-12-31 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100201.htm,"政府今日（十二月三十一日）公布更新的香港《生物多樣性策略及行動計劃》（《計劃》），闡明未來10年香港為保護自然生態和支持可持續發展將採取的策略及優先行動，保護香港的生物多樣性，也助力國家以至全球實現人與自然和諧共生。

環境及生態局發言人說：「自然生態及生物多樣性與我們生活息息相關，是實現社會可持續發展不可或缺的一部分。國家的願景是人與自然和諧共生，我們必須實踐『綠水青山就是金山銀山』的理念，聚焦建設美麗中國。」

國家在《生物多樣性公約》締約方大會第15屆會議上推動通過了「昆明—蒙特利爾全球生物多樣性框架」，提出了新的生物多樣性全球策略框架。國家生態環境部於二○二四年一月發布《中國生物多樣性保護戰略與行動計劃（2023-2030年）》。配合上述框架，政府因應香港的實際情況和條件以及聽取持份者的意見後，以二○一六年推出的首階段《計劃》為基礎，更新《計劃》並制定了下階段的工作。

更新《計劃》提出四個策略範疇，包括自然保育、深化主流化、能力建設及伙伴協作，當中共有30個優先行動及81個優先項目。政府期望繼續與社會各界合作，深化香港的生物多樣性保育工作，向可持續發展。

 更新《計劃》的四個策略範疇如下﹕

（一）自然保育

政府將透過綜合、區域性的措施保護生態系統與物種，維護及修復生物多樣性。優先行動包括︰強化保護區管理並建立濕地保護體系；修復退化生態系統及活化偏遠鄉郊；加強打擊野生動植物罪行和外來入侵物種管理；以及透過管控污染排放，維護水環境免於退化。

（二）深化主流化

政府將持續加強在社會各層面融入生物多樣性保育理念，使其成為貫穿經濟、城市與社區實踐的共同責任。例如︰非政府組織和教育機構可推展各種項目，加深大眾與大自然的連結；企業可披露生物多樣性相關風險及採取可持續作業模式；學術機構可推進知識發展及培育下一代保育人才；城市發展可融入生物多樣性保育理念，如採用「基於自然的解決方案」與野生動植物友善設計；以及各界也可透過支持可持續漁農業、生態旅遊和循環經濟，為推動生物多樣性主流化作出貢獻。

（三）能力建設

政府着重透過提升知識、專業技術與科技發展，增強香港的生物多樣性保育能力。政府將持續支持科學與跨學科研究，以探索知識與技術的前沿；並輔以評估自然現狀、推動社會知識傳播與共享、培育人才及深化專業能力等措施。同時，政府將探索建立生物多樣性資源的中心或平台，使公眾能更深入了解本港的自然瑰寶及遺產。

（四）伙伴協作

政府會致力拓展及鞏固跨地域、行業與社群的夥伴關係，守護自然環境及資源；跨境合作建構生態廊道、打擊野生動植物罪行及管理物種遷徙路徑上的棲息地；增進與國際社會的知識與專業技術交流；借鑑全球最佳實踐經驗及案例，優化現有保育方案，並提升生態資源管理；以及發揮「超級聯繫人」的優勢，促進各方合作，推進粵港澳大灣區生態文明建設，助力國家及全球在生物多樣性議題的最新倡議。

政府將繼續透過專責跨部門工作小組協調及監督更新《計劃》的實施進展。政府亦會定期向環境諮詢委員會匯報推行進度。為方便公眾了解《計劃》的實施情況，政府稍後將推出專題網站，報告工作進展。

Government updates Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan for Hong Kong,2025-12-31 12:12,2025-12-31 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100202.htm,"The Government today (December 31) promulgated the updated Hong Kong Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (BSAP), which sets out the strategies and priority actions Hong Kong will adopt over the next 10 years to protect nature and support sustainable development, to protect Hong Kong's biodiversity and thereby contribute to national and global efforts towards the goal of achieving harmony between humans and nature.

A spokesman for the Environment and Ecology Bureau said, ""Natural ecosystems and biodiversity are deeply intertwined with our well-being and are a vital part in achieving sustainable development in society. The harmonious coexistence between humans and nature is our country's vision. We must act on the concept that 'lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets and focus on building a beautiful China'"".

  At the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the country led the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework which proposed a new global strategic framework for biodiversity conservation. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China released the China National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan (2023-2030) in January 2024. To match these frameworks, and taking into account Hong Kong's actual circumstances and conditions as well as stakeholders' feedback, the Governmenthas updated the BSAP and formulated actions for the next phase, building upon the first phase of the BSAP launched in 2016.

  The updated BSAP puts forward four strategic areas, namely nature conservation, deepening mainstreaming, capacity building, and collaborative partnering, which include a total of 30 priority actions and 81 priority projects. The Government looks forward to continuing collaboration with various sectors in the community to strengthen Hong Kong's biodiversity conservation, enabling sustainable development.

The four strategic areas in the updated BSAP are as follows:

(1) Nature conservation

The Government will protect ecosystems and species through comprehensive and area-based measures to safeguard and restore biodiversity. Priority actions include: strengthening management of protected areas and establishing a wetland conservation system; restoring degraded ecosystems and revitalising remote countryside areas; stepping up enforcement against wildlife crimes and management of invasive alien species; and preventing deterioration of the aquatic environment by controlling pollution discharges.

(2) Deepening mainstreaming

The Government will continue to drive the integration of biodiversity conservation concepts into every sector of society, elevating it to a shared responsibility embedded within economic, urban and community practices. For example, non-governmental organisations and educational institutions can promote various programmes to deepen the public's connection with nature; enterprises can disclose biodiversity-related risks and adopt sustainable operating practices; academic institutions can advance knowledge and nurture the next generation of conservation talent; urban development can also integrate biodiversity conservation concepts by adopting nature-based solutions and wildlife-friendly designs. Other sectors can also contribute to mainstreaming biodiversity by supporting sustainable agriculture and fisheries, ecotourism and the circular economy.

(3) Capacity building

The Government places emphasis on enhancing Hong Kong's biodiversity conservation capacity by advancing knowledge, professional expertise and technological development. The Government will continue to support scientific and interdisciplinary research to explore the frontiers of knowledge and technology, complemented by measures to assess the status of nature, promote knowledge dissemination and sharing with the public, nurture talent, and deepen professional capabilities. At the same time, the Government will explore the establishment of a centre or platform for biodiversity resources, to enable better access by the public to natural treasures and heritage in Hong Kong.

(4) Collaborative partnering

The Government is committed to expanding and strengthening partnerships across regions, sectors and communities to safeguard the natural environment and resources; to create ecological corridors, combat wildlife crimes and manage habitats along species migration routes through cross-boundary co-operation; enhance the exchange of knowledge and expertise with the international community; learn from global best practices and case studies, optimise existing conservation measures, and enhance ecological resources management; capitalise on the role as a ""super connector"" to foster multi-stakeholder collaboration, advance ecological civilisation across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and support the latest initiatives on biodiversity on the national and global levels.

The Government will continue to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation progress of the updated BSAP through the dedicated interdepartmental working group, and report the progress to the Advisory Council on the Environment regularly. To keep the public informed about the implementation, the Government will launch a dedicated website showcasing related work progress.

The updated BSAP has been uploaded to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/conservation/Con_hkbsap/updating_bsap/updating_bsap.html)."

衞生署鼓勵一九五○至一九七六年出生的合資格人士參與大腸癌篩查計劃,2025-12-31 11:05,2025-12-31 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100227.htm,"​衞生署今日（十二月三十一日）宣布，一九五○至一九七六年出生的香港居民，將於明年一月一日起符合資格參加政府資助的大腸癌篩查計劃。衞生署呼籲所有合資格人士盡早參加計劃，同時提倡實踐健康生活來降低大腸癌風險。

計劃以公私營協作的模式推行，資助年齡介乎50至75歲、沒有大腸癌徵狀的香港居民每兩年於私營機構接受篩查。有意參加計劃的人士需先約見參與計劃的基層醫療醫生，安排進行大便免疫化學測試。如大便免疫化學測試結果呈陽性，參加者會獲轉介到大腸鏡醫生接受政府資助的大腸鏡檢查。如測試結果呈陰性，參加者應於兩年後進行覆檢。

截至今年十一月底，今年新增的參與人數已超過66 000人，總參與人數超過579 000名。15%的大便免疫化學測試結果呈陽性，其中約45 000人（7.9%）在接受大腸鏡檢查後確診大腸腺瘤，約3 800人（0.7%）確診大腸癌。分析顯示，在計劃下篩查出確診患上大腸癌的個案中，超過五成屬早期階段，顯示篩查的有效性。

目前，有超過1 200名基層醫療醫生在約2 300個診所提供服務，並有260名大腸鏡醫生參與計劃，於約790個診所進行檢查。在提供大腸鏡檢查基本服務時，大腸鏡醫生只可向參加者收取不多於1,000元的額外費用。超過70%的服務地點不會就大腸鏡檢查或切除瘜肉收取額外費用。

衞生署衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生表示：「大腸癌是本港第三常見的癌症，亦是本港致命癌症中的第二位。在二○二三年，本港錄得5 467宗大腸癌新症，佔所有癌症新症的14.4%。大腸癌篩查可及早識別高危人士及無病徵患者，讓他們能及早接受治療，顯著提高治癒率。此外，在大腸鏡檢查過程中切除大腸腺瘤，則可避免其演變成癌症。」

徐樂堅醫生呼籲合資格人士於50歲開始參加計劃，如篩查結果正常，應每兩年做一次覆檢至75歲為止。另外，實踐健康生活亦有助預防大腸癌，包括多做運動、每天吃兩份水果和三份蔬菜、保持健康體重、不吸煙和不喝酒。他亦鼓勵參加者與合資格親友一同參與計劃。

與此同時，基層醫療署亦積極推廣健康人生計劃。該計劃以預防為本、全人照護為核心，並參考最新實證，為市民制訂不同人生階段的個人化健康策略。家庭醫生及基層醫療專業人員將攜手合作，根據年齡、性別、家族病史等個人因素，提供健康生活模式指導、慢性疾病及癌症篩查，包括大腸癌篩查等服務。

符合計劃資格市民的出生年份於每年年初更新。合資格人士如欲參加計劃，須登記加入電子健康系統。詳情可瀏覽電子健康系統網頁www.ehealth.gov.hk，或致電3467 6300向申請及諮詢中心查詢。

有關計劃的詳情，可瀏覽衞生署專題網頁www.colonscreen.gov.hk或於辦公時間內致電熱線3565 6288。"
DH encourages eligible persons born between 1950 and 1976 to take part in Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme,2025-12-31 11:05,2025-12-31 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100231.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) announced today (December 31) thatHong Kong residents born between 1950 and 1976 will be eligible to enrol in the Government-subsidised Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme (CRCSP) from January 1, 2026. The DH urges all eligible persons to participate in the CRCSP as early as possible and advocates the adoption of healthy lifestyles to lower the risk of colorectal cancer.

Using a public-private partnership model, the CRCSP subsidises asymptomatic Hong Kong residents aged between 50 and 75 to undergo screening tests every two years in the private sector. Participants in the CRCSP should first attend a medical consultation provided by an enrolled primary care doctor (PCD) and receive a Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) screening arranged by the PCD. If the FIT result is positive, the participant will be referred to an enrolled colonoscopy specialist to receive a colonoscopy examination subsidised by the Government. If the FIT result is negative, the participant is advised to repeat the screening two years later.

As of the end of November 2025, over 66 000 new participants have enrolled in the CRCSP this year, bringing the total number of participants to more than 579 000. Among them, 15 per cent had positive FIT screening results, approximately 45 000 persons (7.9 per cent) were diagnosed to have colorectal adenomas, and about 3 800 persons (0.7 per cent) had colorectal cancer after colonoscopy examination. Analysis showed that more than 50 per cent of the colorectal cancer cases detected under the CRCSP were in the early stages, demonstrating the effectiveness of screening.

Currently, more than 1 200 PCDs have enrolled in the CRCSP, covering about 2 300 clinics to provide services, while 260 colonoscopy specialists have also joined the CRCSP to provide examination at about 790 clinics. The colonoscopy specialists can only charge participants a co-payment of no more than $1,000 for providing standard colonoscopy examination services, with over 70 per centof these service locations not charging any additional payment for colonoscopy and polyp removal.

""Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death in Hong Kong. In 2023, there were 5 467 newly diagnosed colorectal cancer cases, accounting for 14.4 per cent of all new cancer cases. Colorectal cancer screenings can identify people at higher risk of colorectal cancer and asymptomatic patients, and enable them to receive early treatment, thus significantly improving prognosis. Also, removing colorectal adenoma during a colonoscopy can prevent it from developing into cancer,"" said the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Edwin Tsui.

 Dr Tsui called on eligible persons to join the CRCSP starting at age 50. If the screening result is normal, rescreening should be performed every two years until age 75. In addition, adopting a healthy lifestyle can help prevent colorectal cancer; this includes exercising regularly, eating two servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables daily, maintaining a healthy body weight, and avoiding smoking and alcohol drinking. Participants are also encouraged to invite eligible relatives and friends to join the CRCSP.

 At the same time, the Primary Healthcare Commission is actively promoting the Life Course Preventive Care Plan. Based on the core principles of prevention-oriented and whole-person care, a personalised preventive care plan will be formulated to address the health needs of citizens across different life stages with reference to the latest evidence. Family doctors and primary healthcare professionals will collaborate to provide services based on age, sex, family history and other personal factors, such as advice on healthy lifestyle, chronic disease and cancer screening, which includes colorectal cancer screening.

 The years of birth for eligible persons are updated at the beginning of each year. Eligible persons who are interested in joining the CRCSP must enrol in the Electronic Health System (eHealth). Please refer to the eHealth website atwww.ehealth.gov.hkor call the Registration Office at 3467 6300 for details.

 For more information on the CRCSP, please visit the DH's thematic websitewww.colonscreen.gov.hkor call the dedicated hotline (3565 6288) during office hours."

The Platform will provide one-stop digital corporate identity authentication and related services for Hong Kong corporations established or registered under the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) and local businesses registered under the Business Registration Ordinance (Cap. 310), thereby facilitating e-business activities between Hong Kong corporations and the Government as well as other public and private organisations.

  The main functions of the Platform include digital corporate identity authentication, digital signing, pre-filling of forms and storage of digital licences and permits, etc., which facilitate Hong Kong corporations to undergo corporate identity authentication and corporate signature verification in a secure and convenient manner when using e-government services and conducting online transactions, hence alleviating the complicated procedures of submitting and verifying duplicate copies of related original documents and company chops. At the same time, it enables corporations to reuse information previously provided when using different electronic services, saving processing time and reducing human errors, hence facilitating the digital transformation of corporations.

CorpID Sandbox Programme

  The CorpID Sandbox Programme will provide participating service providers with appropriate technical support, reference documentations and simulated Application Programming Interface (API). It will also introduce suitable application scenarios enabling service providers to test the functions of the CorpID.

  Through this Sandbox Programme, government departments as well as public and private organisations can understand the API specifications related to the CorpID, and utilise these API for testing and application development, thus making adequate preparations for the adoption of the CorpID in the future.

  Service providers interested to participate can visit the CorpID Sandbox Programme website (sb.corpid.gov.hk) for registration.

  The DPO encourages the industry to actively participate in the Sandbox Programme and jointly explore the application potential of the CorpID, thereby together promoting the digital economy development of Hong Kong's digital economy and facilitating corporations to enhance business efficiency through digital transformation."

The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

The two clusters involved four males and four females aged between 3 and 69. They developed diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and fever about 10 to 29 hours after consuming takeaway scallop fried rice and poon choi purchased from a branch of the Café de Coral located at the Shop N95, 1/F (Ptn B), 1-17 Mount Sterling Mall, Mei Foo Sun Chuen, on December 21.

  The seven affected persons sought medical advice and one of them required hospitalisation. That person's stool specimen tested positive for Salmonella bacteria.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.
 
Officers of the CHP and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch) conducted a joint investigation at the restaurant. They examined the handling processes and food hygiene, and collected food and environmental samples for testing. A preliminary investigation revealed that the food concerned has a risk of cross contamination in the handling process. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to stop selling the incriminated food items, and carry out cleaning and disinfection of premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises.

  The investigation of the CHP and the CFS is ongoing.

  ""Members of the public are reminded to maintain food and environmental hygiene, which is the key to preventing food poisoning. During the festive season, some may choose to order takeaway poon choi for gatherings. The public should pay attention to the key points of food safety when consuming poon choi. Chilled poon choi should be kept at four degrees Celsius or below. And don't collect the poon choi too early. It is best to collect it half an hour to one hour before consumption. When collecting and transporting poon choi, make sure it is kept at above 60 degrees C. Before consuming poon choi, it should be reheated thoroughly till the core temperature reaches at least 75 degrees C,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

More information on thehealthy tips for enjoying poon choiandguidelines for safe production of poon choican be found on the websites of the CHP and the CFS.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:

Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and

The exhibition leads visitors to explore the literary and military achievements in the life of the formidable hero Cao Cao. The exhibition traces the discovery, excavation and verification of Cao Cao's tomb to unveil the mystery and reveal the true character of Cao Cao. Admission is free.

Cao Cao (155-220 AD) was an outstanding politician, military strategist and poet during the late Eastern Han dynasty. He laid the foundation for the establishment of the Wei state and profoundly influenced the historical trajectory of the Three Kingdoms period. In 2009, Cao Cao's tomb was discovered in Anyang, Henan Province, followed by intense debate over the authenticity of the tomb. The academic community has now confirmed Xigaoxue Tomb in Anyang as the Mausoleum of Cao Cao, and the layout of the cemetery, the burial structure and the remains and various artefacts found in the tomb form a complete chain of evidence.

Incorporating replicas of excavated artefacts and drawing upon the research of Chair Professor of Humanities at the Southern University of Science and Technology, and former researcher at the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Professor Tang Jigen, the exhibition reveals the true character of the formidable hero Cao Cao, while offering a glimpse into the social and political landscape of the late Eastern Han dynasty. In addition to panels for children and videos, visitors can explore Cao Cao's multifaceted personality through an interactive rotating cube installation that showcases well-known anecdotes. There is also a photo spot where visitors can savour the grandeur of Cao Cao's literary and military achievements.

The exhibition is organised by the CCPO, and supported by the Hong Kong Museum of History. For details of the exhibition, please visit the website: www.ccpo.gov.hk/en/programme/archaeology-of-cao-cao-exhibition.​"

七名受影響人士已求醫，其中一人須留院治理，其大便樣本驗出沙門氏菌。全部受影響人士現時情況穩定。

衞生防護中心和食物環境衞生署人員（包括食物安全中心和環境衞生部人員）已到涉事食物業處所調查，檢視食物烹調流程和衞生，並抽取食物及環境樣本作化驗。初步調查顯示有關食物在處理過程中存在交叉污染的風險。食物安全中心已即時指示有關處所暫停供應涉事食物、清潔消毒處所，及向餐廳員工提供食物安全和環境衞生教育。

衞生防護中心和食物安全中心的調查仍然繼續。

衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒：「市民應保持食物和環境衞生，預防食物中毒。節日聚會期間，不少人會選擇訂購盆菜回家享用，市民應留意盆菜食物安全要點。經冷凍處理的盆菜應保持在攝氏四度或以下；不要過早提取盆菜，於食用前半小時至一小時為合適，並於提取和運送盆菜時確保盆菜保持在攝氏60度以上，在食用前須將食物徹底翻熱至中心溫度達攝氏75度或以上。」

市民可到衞生防護中心和食物安全中心網頁參考健康享用盆菜的錦囊和製造盆菜的安全指引。

要預防經由食物傳播的疾病，市民應經常保持個人、食物及環境衞生。在外進食時，應注意以下要點：


避免進食生的海產；
小心選擇冷盤，包括自助餐的刺身、壽司及生蠔；
如需製作以未經徹底煮熟的蛋為用料的菜式時，應選用經巴士德消毒的蛋、蛋製品或蛋粉；
光顧可靠及有牌照的食肆；
火鍋或燒烤時，確保食物已徹底煮熟才進食；
在烹煮過程中，小心處理並要徹底分開生和熟的食物；
使用兩套筷子及用具分開處理生及熟的食物；
不要光顧無牌食物檔；
飲用經煮沸的水；
高危人士（包括免疫力較低的人、長者、孕婦及幼童）患食源性疾病的風險較高，故不應進食生或未經徹底煮熟的食物；
不要試圖用鹽、醋、酒及日本芥末殺菌，因為均沒有殺菌效用；及
進食前及如廁後要洗手。

​兩名入境旅客進口未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-12-30 18:00,2025-12-30 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000582.htm,"兩名入境男旅客因進口未完稅香煙及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（十二月三十日）在西九龍裁判法院各被判處監禁六個月及罰款一千元，和監禁三個月及罰款一千元。

海關人員於十一月十六日在香港國際機場截查一名二十七歲的抵港男旅客，並在他攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約五萬八千支未完稅香煙，估計市值約二十三萬七千七百元，應課稅值約十九萬一千七百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日被判處監禁六個月及罰款一千元。

另外，海關人員在上述日子於機場截查一名四十二歲的抵港男旅客，並在他攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約一萬九千支未完稅香煙，估計市值約七萬七千九百元，應課稅值約六萬二千八百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日被判處監禁三個月及罰款一千元。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-12-30 18:00,2025-12-30 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000583.htm,"​Two incoming male passengers were sentenced to six months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,000, and three months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,000 respectively by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (December 30) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 27, at Hong Kong International Airport on November 16. About 58 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $237,700 and a duty potential of about $191,700 were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,000 today.

As well, Customs officers intercepted another incoming male passenger, aged 42, at the airport on the abovementioned date. About 19 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $77,900 and a duty potential of about $62,800 were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to three months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,000 today.

Customs welcomes the sentences. The custodial sentences have imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflect the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
FSTB issues progress update on work of Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime and related disciplinary investigation,2025-12-30 17:42,2025-12-30 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000523.htm,"The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) today (December 30) issued a progress update on the report of the Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime and the disciplinary investigation of the incident on procurement of bottled drinking water. An FSTB spokesman said that subsequent to the announcement and implementation of a series of quick-win measures in October to strengthen protection against fraudulent acts, the Task Force chaired by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, has been exploring further enhancement measures and has completed its review on the existing government procurement regime. The disciplinary investigation of the incident on procurement of bottled drinking water was also completed recently. The Government is studying the investigation report and consulting the Department of Justice to determine suitable disciplinary actions to be taken. Relevant results will be announced as soon as possible and are expected to be ready next month. The results will then be announced together with the Task Force report to conclude the incident.

Furthermore, the Government Logistics Department launched an open tender today for the contract to supply bottled drinking water to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands. Following new guidelines promulgated this October, this tender exercise has strengthened relevant requirements at various stages, including preparation of tender documents, tender evaluation and contract management, to help procurement officers guard against fraudulent acts more effectively and to select a supplier competent to ensure a stable supply of bottled drinking water in accordance with contract terms."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-30 17:31,2025-12-30 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000567.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 30), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10 of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-30 17:30,2025-12-30 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/30/P2025123000563.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月三十日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————
本港今年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自十二月十日確診一宗於十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
