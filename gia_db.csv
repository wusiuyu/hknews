The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) said that due to the Tai Po fire, adjustments will be made to three polling stations in the district as follows:




Original polling stations
Reallocated polling stations upon adjustment


Tai Po Baptist Public School
Hong Kong Teachers' Association Lee Heng Kwei Secondary School


Kwong Fuk Community Hall
Sung Tak Wong Kin Sheung Memorial School


Tai Po Community Centre

Since the electors need to relocate from their original polling stations to the reallocated polling stations for casting their votes, the REO will arrange free feeder transportation services during the polling hours on the polling day to facilitate the voting by the relevant electors at the reallocated polling stations. Details of the feeder services are as below:


Between Kwong Fuk Estate, the Tai Po Kau area and Tai Po Market MTR Station, and the polling station at Hong Kong Teachers' Association Lee Heng Kwei Secondary School;
Between Kwong Fuk Estate and the polling station at Sung Tak Wong Kin Sheung Memorial School; and

Except for those electors of Wang Fuk Court who are currently residing in other districts, the REO will send a notice to affected electors in Kwong Fuk Estate, Tai Po Kau area and Tai Po Market to inform them of their reallocated polling stations. The affected electors may also check relevant voting information starting from 9am tomorrow (December 3) via ""iAM Smart"" or by logging into the Online Voter Information Enquiry System (www.voterinfo.gov.hk). Additionally, the REO will post notices in the buildings where the affected electors reside to inform them of their new polling stations, and will arrange staff to the vicinity of the original polling stations on the polling day to remind electors to proceed to their reallocated polling stations.

For those electors of Wang Fuk Court who are currently residing in other districts due to the fire, the REO will proactively notify them of their reallocated polling station arrangements through social workers under the ""one social worker per household"" service. The REO will also arrange suitable transportation to take the electors to cast their votes at the polling stations upon consulting their voting intentions.

If the affected electors have any enquiries regarding these arrangements, they are advised to call the election hotline at 2891 1001 during office hours."
Government announces updates on Task Forces' follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-02 23:33,2025-12-02 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200910.htm,"  In view of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po that resulted in multiple casualties, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, today (December 2) announced that an independent committee to be led by a judge will be established to conduct a comprehensive review to examine the cause of the fire and related issues, in order to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.

  Meanwhile, the Government continues to make full efforts in following up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the fire. The latest progress made by various bureaux and departments under the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fundraising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation - led respectively by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, and the Deputy Financial Secretary - is as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po established by the Government, as of noon today, the donations received have reached $2 billion. In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has reached around $2.3 billion. The fund will be used to assist the residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support. The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide the families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 21 cases have been processed, and disbursements are underway. In addition, the Government also announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance of $50,000 to each affected household. As of today, 104 cases have been processed, and disbursements are also underway.

  To provide immediate relief for affected residents, the Government has been offering an emergency subsidy of $10,000 per affected household since the evening of November 27. As of 4pm today, the Government had registered more than 1 930 households for the subsidy, with disbursements made to 1 916 households.

  Social workers of the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 500 affected households so far for registration of the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD also deployed social workers and clinical psychologists to accompany families in attending vigils at the scene today and provided them with emotional support. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households for provision of all necessary assistance while fully backing the support and relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

  As of this morning (December 2), 1 013 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps or hotel rooms. Another 1 607 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units of the Hong Kong Housing Society. In addition, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. As for the other temporary shelter at the Tung Cheong Street Community Hall, it will no longer accept new users but will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to the arranged emergency accommodation.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform (www.taipodonation.hk) established by the Government and the information technology sector began operation on November 30 to facilitate registration of supplies donations from organisations and members of the public. Together with the information provided by members of the public via WhatsApp earlier, the Government has so far received over 860 registrations with different kinds of donation items including food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, beddings and electrical appliances. The Government will consolidate information of all donation items and distribute supplies to residents in need as necessary.

Funeral services
------------------

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has arranged dedicated staff for each family of the deceased to assist them in making funeral arrangements at their preferred time and location. The FEHD has set up a service counter at the Fu Shan Public Mortuary and will proactively contact the families through the social workers of the SWD. Once the families have made decisions, the FEHD will follow up on the relevant arrangements promptly. The FEHD also maintains close liaison with the funeral trade to provide necessary assistance to the families.

   Besides, the Government will waive fees for columbarium and related services, and will provide $50,000 to the families of each deceased individual through the ""one social worker per household"" service to cover funeral and related expenses.

Education support
--------------------

  The school premises of Tai Po Baptist Public School (TPBPS) will remain closed for a certain period of time due to the fire. In order to facilitate early resumption of the normal teaching routine of TPBPS and provide proper care for the students, the Education Bureau (EDB) has co-ordinated with schools in Tai Po District to deploy available classrooms and has arranged for TPBPS students to attend classes by grade level at the school premises of Tai Po Government Primary School and N.T.W.J.W.A Christian Remembrance of Grace Primary School from the middle of this month. The EDB has set up a working group dedicated to implementing the above arrangements. The Government will earmark $5 million to support the operations of the above schools during the transition period and provide appropriate learning and teaching assistance for students and teachers.

Handling of reported missing persons
------------------------------------------

  The Police have earlier completed searches at five buildings and started searching the remaining two most affected buildings yesterday (December 1). Today, 330 officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit (DVIU) were deployed to continue the search. The Fire Services Department (FSD) personnel are also supporting the DVIU by forcing open doors at the scene and providing relevant information. As of 4pm today, the Police handled 13 sets of human remains in the buildings, including five sets of newly found and eight sets found by firefighters but yet to be removed. The number of the deceased has been updated to 156. The Police will continue to follow up on the reported missing persons, aiming to confirm their status and the number of casualties as soon as possible.

  The forensic pathologists from the Department of Health continued to assist personnel from the DVIU on-site in collecting evidence, making every effort to help identify the deceased. As of 4pm today, the next of kin of 116 victims have completed necessary procedures at the Fu Shan Public Mortuary.

Investigations
-----------------

  The FSD continues to take photos and gather evidence at the fire scene, and is discussing with the Lands Department to create a 3D model to assist the investigation.

  The Police have so far arrested a total of 15 people on suspicion of manslaughter, including two individuals from a construction company arrested last night, and 13 individuals from various construction companies arrested earlier. The Police have accorded top priority to the case and are gathering evidence through various channels for a thorough and in-depth investigation. The possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

  The Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau conducted a meeting with structural engineering experts and professionals from the Housing Department (HD) today to study the structure of the buildings in Wang Fuk Court in detail and formulate an action plan for the extraction of concrete cores samples for detailed analysis. Additionally, firefighters are assisting the HD with temporary reinforcement work for 13 units in Wang Cheong Court.

  The ICU today contacted representatives of Sui Wo Court, Ching Lai Court, Yee Kok Court and On Kay Court once again and noted that the registered contractors have proactively started dismantling the protective nets in the respective housing courts. The ICU will continue to monitor the situation. For Wang Chi House, the contractor of the HD will remove the plastic sheeting on the external walls as well as the protective nets after departments, including the FSD and the Labour Department (LD) have completed collecting evidence on-site.

  Relevant departments continued the special inspections of existing buildings undergoing major external wall maintenance, and took samples for testing from buildings installed with scaffold nets. As of today, the Buildings Department (BD) has taken samples from 352 private buildings and sent them for testing in batches. The Architectural Services Department has also inspected all 18 of its public works building projects and collected samples for testing. In order to enhance the accuracy of whether the relevant materials meet the fire-retardant requirements, the departments are adopting rigorous and extensive sampling methods, taking samples from different parts of the external walls of buildings. Due to the large sample size (with thousands of samples being drawn), it will take considerable time to conduct the sampling and testing, and all parties will strive to complete this as soon as possible. Apart from the two buildings where plastic sheeting was found blocking the windows as announced earlier (removed already in accordance with the Government's instructions), the BD did not find other buildings that used foam boards or plastic sheeting to block windows.

  The LD launched a territory-wide special enforcement operation on November 28, targeting the fire protection facilities and fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. This includes checking if protective screens (also known as scaffold nets) on scaffolds are in compliance with recognised standards for fire-retardant materials to safeguard the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 110 construction sites, issued a total of 70 written warnings and 46 improvement notices, and has taken out 11 prosecutions."

Polling stations

In view of the fire in Tai Po, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) will make new arrangements for three polling stations in the district.

處理報稱失聯人士個案
——————————

警方早前已完成搜索五幢大廈，昨日（十二月一日）展開餘下兩幢受災最嚴重的大廈的搜索工作，今日派出330名「災難遇害者辨認組」人員繼續相關搜索。消防處人員亦向「災難遇害者辨認組」提供協助，包括為火場單位爆門及提供資料。今日截至下午四時，警方在各大廈內處理共13具遺骸，當中包括五具新發現的遺骸及八具早前由消防人員發現但未被移離的遺骸，死者數目更新至156人。警方會繼續跟進報稱失聯人士個案，務求盡快確認他們的情況及死傷人數。

衞生署的法醫科醫生繼續在災場協助「災難遇害者辨認組」人員搜集證據，全力協助辨認逝者身分。截至今日下午四時，累計已有116名罹難者的親屬到富山公眾殮房辦理手續。

調查工作
————

消防處正繼續於火警現場進行拍照蒐證，並與地政總署探討製作3D模型以協助調查。

警方至今共拘捕15人涉嫌誤殺，包括昨晚拘捕的兩名工程公司相關人士，以及早前拘捕的13名來自不同的工程公司相關人士。警方極度重視此案件，正循多方面搜證，作出全面及深入的調查，不排除有更多人被捕。

規管巡查
————

房屋局獨立審查組（審查組）今日聯同結構工程專家及房屋署專業人員召開會議，詳細研究宏福苑相關樓宇的結構狀況，以及擬定抽取混凝土芯作詳細分析的行動計劃。消防處人員亦協助房屋署為宏昌閣13個單位進行臨時加固工作。

審查組今日亦再次聯絡穗禾苑、清麗苑、怡閣苑及安基苑，得悉各註冊承建商已開始主動拆除屋苑內的棚網，審查組會繼續監察情況。至於宏志閣，房屋署承建商會在消防處和勞工處等相關部門完成現場取證後，再拆除外牆塑料膠板和棚網等。

各有關部門繼續進行特別巡查正進行外牆大維修的現存樓宇，並向有棚網的樓宇取樣檢驗。截至今日，屋宇署已就352幢有棚網的私人樓宇抽取樣本，陸續分批送交測試，建築署亦已巡查轄下所有18個工務工程樓宇項目並取樣檢驗。為更準確檢查棚網物料是否符合阻燃要求，部門採用嚴謹及廣泛的取樣方法，從樓宇外牆不同位置抽取樣本，由於樣本數量龐大（抽取的樣本數以千計），需要較多時間進行採樣及檢測工作，各方會爭取早日完成。此外，除早前已公布發現的兩幢有塑膠板遮封窗戶的樓宇（已按政府指示移除），屋宇署暫未有再發現有發泡膠或塑膠板遮封窗戶的樓宇。

勞工處十一月二十八日起展開全港性特別執法行動，巡查設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工程工地的防火設施及火災應變安排，當中包括檢查棚架上的保護幕（俗稱「棚網」）阻燃性認可標準，以保障工人的職業安全。截至今日下午四時，勞工處已巡查110個建築地盤，共發出70份書面警告及46張敦促改善通知書，並提出11宗檢控。"

FEHD and Hong Kong Customs continue to inspect premises selling hairy crabs in various districts (with photos),2025-12-02 20:57,2025-12-02 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200721.htm,"To safeguard food safety, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and Hong Kong Customs conducted joint blitz operations in late November to inspect selling points of hairy crabs across various districts, following a similar joint operation in October. The inspections aimed to ensure that hairy crabs on sale in the market comply with relevant requirements under the laws. The FEHD and Customs also stepped up joint enforcement actions at boundary control points against suspected parallel traders bringing hairy crabs into Hong Kong for selling purpose.

A spokesman for the FEHD said today (December 2), ""During the joint blitz inspections of selling points of hairy crabs, officers from the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the FEHD and Customs officers have inspected 50 premises selling hairy crabs. The source documents and health certificates of the hairy crabs were checked to ensure that the hairy crabs sold at the premises are in compliance with the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132) as well as the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO) (Cap. 362) and are fit for human consumption. The FEHD and Customs officers also distributed promotional leaflets to the operators of the premises, reminding them to pay attention to food safety and comply with relevant requirements under the laws. During the operations, no contravention was found.""

The CFS has maintained close liaison with Customs to strengthen joint enforcement actions at boundary control points, targeting suspected parallel traders carrying hairy crabs into Hong Kong for selling purpose. Over the past six weeks, the CFS received 16 suspected cases referred by Customs, intercepted over 1 900 hairy crabs. Upon referral, the CFS immediately started follow-up investigations into the source of the crabs, whether health certificates were provided, the intended use of the crabs brought into Hong Kong, and whether the persons involved were registered as importers under the Food Safety Ordinance (Cap. 612). Follow-up actions are ongoing.

At the retail level, the FEHD also conducted blitz inspections over the past three weeks. Prosecutions were initiated against two public market stalls for selling hairy crabs without permission. The FEHD also found six online platforms holding online sale of restricted food permits that failed to display permit details on their websites as required. Verbal warnings were issued, and subsequent re-inspections confirmed compliance. The FEHD will continue monitoring and take appropriate actions.

According to the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), all food available for sale in Hong Kong, locally produced or imported, should be fit for human consumption. An offender in this regard is subject to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months upon conviction. Under the Food Safety Ordinance (Cap. 612), any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with the record-keeping requirement relating to movement of food commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months upon conviction.

Under the Food Business Regulation (Cap. 132X) (the Regulation), save with the written permission of the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene (DFEH), no person shall sell any restricted foods, including shellfish. Operators selling hairy crabs shall obtain the Shell Fish (Hairy Crab) Permit or relevant written permission granted by the FEHD; or, if the shop already holds another relevant FEHD licence (such as a fresh provision shop licence) or operates a fish stall in a market managed by the FEHD, the operator must apply for written permission. Premises holding a permit or licence must, in accordance with the law, display the permit or licence prominently. If the operator sells only through online platforms, they must apply for an online sale of restricted food permit. The website or online platform account homepage selling hairy crabs must clearly display the permit information, such as the permit number, registered address, and the types of restricted foods approved for sale. The relevant regulatory condition also stipulates that hairy crabs for sale shall be obtained from a reliable and reputable source. A copy of the health certificate issued by the relevant authority and acceptable to the DFEH shall also be kept. Under the Regulation, any person who operates an unlicensed food business or sells restricted foods without permission commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months upon conviction.

Customs reminds traders not to apply a false trade description to goods or services, or to supply or offer to supply goods or services to which a false trade description is applied. Those who violate the TDO are liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years. Customs also attaches great importance to the protection of consumer rights and will take appropriate enforcement action once activities in violation of the TDO are detected in the market.

The FEHD and Customs remind the trade not to import or put on sale hairy crabs or other food with an unknown origin, and consumers should make purchases at reputable shops with the Shell Fish (Hairy Crab) Permit or relevant written permission granted by the FEHD.

If members of the public suspect that there are operators selling hairy crabs without the relevant permits/permissions or the hairy crabs are not accompanied with health certificates, they may make a report by calling the FEHD hotline at 2868 0000 or through email (enquiries@fehd.gov.hk).

In addition, members of the public may make a report to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/) for suspected violations of the TDO."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-02 19:53,2025-12-02 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200710.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月一日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————
個案涉及一名64歲女子，居於東區。初步調查顯示，她於十一月二十一日至二十七日到訪廣東省廣州市。她在十一月三十日出現發燒及關節痛，同日到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。她的三名家居接觸者，包括一名同行到廣州市的人士，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————
本港今年累計錄得76宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，七宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就近期在青衣居住的輸入及本地個案，中心在接獲通報後已即時進行流行病學調查及把他們的活動地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），以進行控蚊滅蚊行動。鑑於部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心自十一月二十三日起呼籲近日曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線2125 2373。熱線每日上午九時至下午八時運作。中心接獲兩名有輕微病徵的人士致電查詢，並已安排他們進行抽血檢查，兩人的樣本均對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

中心上周亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。政府各相關部門已經針對所有輸入個案加強蚊媒防控措施，以及在當區進行個案主動追蹤工作，中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

​特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署已進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署亦已要求相關部門在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地。食環署同時向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-02 19:53,2025-12-02 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200712.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (December 2), the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
-----------------------------
 The case involves a 64-year-old female living in Eastern District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Guangzhou in Guangdong from November 21 to 27. She developed a fever and joint pain on November 30 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on the same day. She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has three household contacts, including one travel collateral to Guangzhou. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

As the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during the incubation period, the CHP considered that the case was infected during her travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 76 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, seven were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

Regarding the recent imported and local cases residing in Tsing Yi, the CHP initiated immediate epidemiological investigations upon notification and notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the patients' activity locations for mosquito control operations. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, since November 23, the CHP has urged individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP received enquiries from two individuals with mild symptoms and has arranged blood tests for them. Both blood samples tested negative for the chikungunya virus.

Last week, the CHP also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services. All relevant government departments have strengthened mosquito vector control measures for all imported cases and conducted active case tracing in the district. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. Pamphlets have been also distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations. The FEHD has earlier requested the relevant departments to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The FEHD also held meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to coordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water.

記者：你好，首先想請問火災後，幾乎所有候選人的宣傳工程都停止，不單候選人，對選民來說都少了渠道和時間去認識這些候選人。這麼快就要投票，會否對各方面都未有足夠時間讓他們做合適的決定？另外，會如何評估現時這個投票率？另外，政府會全力幫助災民，亦會調派公務員做幫助選舉的工作，現在又會安排公務員幫忙支援火災，人手安排方面如何？以及哪一樣事情會比較優先？另外，做選舉公務員的人手會否相應減少？多謝。

政務司司長：首先，我們都明白到，包括我們在內，我想每一位市民都對這次火災深深地覺得很悲痛、很傷心。大家都很希望盡力幫助受災的市民盡快重新生活，我想這是每一位市民的意願。

正如剛才所說，所有立法會的選舉工作要進行，我們很需要一個立法會盡快選出，因為一月一日便要履職。立法會的工作有很多方面，譬如可以匯聚、反映民意，亦要制定法律、監督政府、優化政策等。除了這些需要立法會議員的幫助外，幫助災民方面的工作亦需要立法會議員的幫助，包括有需要修改法例時，他們要幫忙審議；我們要求撥款時，亦需要立法會同意。所以我們希望能夠如期選出立法會議員，能夠盡早幫助市民，特別包括災民在內，解決問題。

當然，我們知道大家是傷痛的，但希望大家都要認清楚剛才所說的立法會選舉的重要性，希望所有合資格的選民出來投票，能夠盡早如期產生一個立法會，這最能夠幫助我們。

至於兩方面的工作有沒有互相先後，這是沒有的。在立法會選舉和幫助災民方面，是雙軌並行，並不會因為選立法會而拖慢我們對災民的幫助工作，這是絕對不會的。

人手方面亦一樣，我們有很多公務員，我們有選舉事務處和選舉管理委員會，每方面都有一套人手去做，所以人手方面是絕對足夠。我亦相信救災工作並不會影響選舉，選舉工作亦都並不會影響到救災。

記者：你好，司長。二○二○年立法會選舉以疫情為由，用《緊急法》延後立法會選舉，為甚麼這次不能用同樣方法？是否當局覺得這次事故的嚴重性沒有疫情那麼高？其實現時很多居民還未找到地方住，很多市民還未收到社工的致電，你如何可以確保受災情影響的居民和每一位受災情影響的香港人可以理性地判斷下一屆立法會選舉的議員？還是整個選舉只是一種轉移視線，淡化災情的一個方法？謝謝司長。

政務司司長：這次火災，政府的關注度、市民的關注度，我想是不容置疑，我們是全力、全心去幫助災民，希望他們盡快回復正常生活。我們覺得如期選舉，而不是將它延期，這個做法是最合適的。如期選出新的立法會議員，他們才能夠幫我們審議法案、修改法例。剛才有記者朋友問及，他們在大火之前亦有展開選舉工程，當然因為大火原因而暫停一段時間，我們希望餘下幾天的時間，透過論壇等讓選民認識候選的立法會議員，借這幾日的機會，盡量介紹他們的政綱給選民認識，所以我們覺得這次如期舉行是一個最適合的安排。

記者：你好，兩方面，首先想問，其實在現時的社會氛圍下，當局如何預測投票率？還有繼續去舉辦這些跟選舉相關的文娛活動或優惠，其實是否合適？另外想問司長，可否解釋一下，為甚麼當局堅持不成立獨立調查委員會？在這個沒有法定傳召權的情況下，當局有沒有甚麼措施或政策可以確保各機構或政府部門會配合調查？

政務司司長：我想重申，我們從來都沒有對投票率有預設目標，如果有預設目標，就是希望每一位合資格選民都出來投票，這是我們的工作目標。剛才我們亦有指出，嘉年華會、「繽紛日」等比較歡樂性的節目，我們都取消了，但一些資訊性、生活性的，我們則保留，因為始終例如選舉展覽，是有教育意義的，特別是對小朋友，他們現在未達成為選民的年齡，但我們很希望能夠透過教育，將來他們一到年齡，就可以成為選民去投票，為香港建設更好的未來。"

政務司司長：各位傳媒朋友大家好。

立法會是政府施政的一個重要合作夥伴。我們明白大家現在很關心如何能幫助受災巿民盡快重新生活，正如行政長官在今日早上指出，選出有抱負、有能力的立法會議員是大埔火災後重建路上重要的一步，當然政府對受災巿民的支援和跟進工作不會停止，與此同時，如期完成選舉，是對社會穩定的維護，更是對災後重建工作的有力支撐。新一屆議員盡早履職，亦能更快、更有效地推進包括善後支援、復原重建，以至法例檢討和改革等重要工作。

行政長官已宣布第八屆立法會換屆選舉將如期在星期日，即十二月七日進行投票。我現在就選舉的相關事宜作進一步的公布。

選舉論壇

首先是選舉論壇，自上星期三發生火災後，我們已即時暫停原訂於上星期四至星期日舉行的八場功能界別選舉論壇，這做法是希望讓社會各界聚焦救災工作。

現時立法會選舉會如期舉行，我們亦會恢復舉辦餘下的八場論壇。因應現時的情況，因為餘下的日子不多，我們會就論壇進行一些調整，適當加入候選人對支援受災居民和災後處理的一些意見，我們亦會詢問他們的意見。

論壇將於明日和後日（即十二月三日及四日）連續兩日恢復舉辦，每日四場。

票站安排

另一方面，因應今次大埔火災，選舉事務處將會重新安排區內的三個票站。受影響的主要包括宏福苑、廣福邨、大埔滘和大埔墟的選民。政制及內地事務局局長稍後會就票站安排和一般選務安排作出更詳細介紹。

選舉繽紛日、免費開放設施及優惠等

至於其他宣傳選舉的安排，因應最新的火災情況，政府不會於十二月六日舉辦「選舉繽紛日」，只會保留資訊性活動，即是於鑽石山荷里活廣場舉行的「選舉與我」巡迴展覽，其他嘉年華、同樂日，以至綜合晚會等活動一概取消。

而十二月六日及七日免費開放政府設施以及由部門提供給全港市民的優惠，很多都是免費入場的優惠將會繼續，當中包括漁護署（漁農自然護理署）的濕地公園；康文署（康樂及文化事務署）的公眾游泳池、香港科學館、香港太空館和香港藝術館的收費展覽會繼續免費開放；活化歷史建築伙伴計劃下的14個項目、法定古蹟景賢里以及元創方的免費導賞團都會繼續；環保署（環境保護署）、食環署（食物環境衞生署）和房委會（香港房屋委員會）轄下的指定商場或街市提供的不同安排等都會繼續。

而選民投票後我們會繼續派發心意謝卡以表達我們的謝意。

我呼籲選民在關注火災善後的同時，亦請於十二月七日投票日積極投票，選出有抱負、有承擔、有理想、有能力的新一屆立法會議員，與政府共同推動經濟民生發展，當然包括大埔火災的善後重建復常工作，一定要共同建設更美好的香港家園。

我現在請政制及內地事務局局長作進一步介紹。

政制及內地事務局局長：各位傳媒朋友大家好。

在選務安排方面，選舉事務處已向全港選民寄出投票通知卡，通知他們所獲編配的一般票站安排，以及已寄出列明新投票時間，即上午七時三十分至晚上十一時三十分的通知。至於其他投票站包括鄰近邊境投票站以及其他專屬及外展投票站，現時相關的登記安排仍然進行中，選舉事務處會陸續發出通知予成功登記的選民，請他們按照選舉事務處所通知的投票時間前往相關票站進行投票。

另外，因應今次大埔火災的影響，選舉事務處亦會重新安排區內的三個票站，包括大埔浸信會公立學校、廣福社區會堂及大埔社區中心。該三個原設票站將更改為香港教師會李興貴中學、大埔崇德黃建常紀念學校及羅定邦中學這三個新票站。受影響的主要包括宏福苑、廣福邨、大埔滘以及大埔墟的選民。由於有關選民須前往新的票站，我們會安排穿梭巴士以便利有關選民前往新票站進行投票。有關詳情選舉事務處今日稍後會發新聞公布通知大家。

至於受火災影響目前居住在其他地區的宏福苑居民，除公布新的票站安排外，我們亦會主動透過「一戶一社工」下的社工人員通知受災居民新的投票站安排，並會視乎他們的投票意願安排合適的交通工具接送他們前往票站進行投票。

我的報告暫時是這麼多。"
Speech by SJ at Third Legal Forum on Interconnectivity and Development (English only) (with photos/video),2025-12-02 19:25,2025-12-02 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200661.htm,"  Following are the closing remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the Third Legal Forum on Interconnectivity and Development under Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 today (December 2):

Deputy Commissioner Zhang Changwei (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), your excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

May I first express my sincere gratitude to the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for co-organising the Legal Forum with the Department of Justice (DoJ) for the third year since the launch of the event back in 2023. I would also like to thank our moderators and speakers, some of whom have travelled from afar to share their invaluable insights; as well as to all of you for participating in the Legal Forum this afternoon.

This Forum has built on the success of the past Forum which stressed on international co-operation and echoed the notion of the Global Governance Initiative (GGI) put forward by President Xi Jinping, while the core concept under the GGI is to maintain and enhance multilateralism. China is a staunch supporter of multilateralism and has made consistent contributions to the advancement of international rule of law. In this regard, we had the honour of opening the afternoon's forum with Professor Huang Jin's keynote speech on China's contribution to international rule of law.

Following the general overview by Professor Huang in his keynote speech, Session 1 looked more specifically at some examples of practising multilateralism and upholding the international rule of law. We had the benefit of learning from the experts from international organisations and from China on how private international law, international mediation and the Greater Bay Area can contribute to practising multilateralism and come up with answers to different global issues in order to uphold the international rule of law.

In this connection, Hong Kong as a global ""super connector"" and ""value-adder"", we strongly support upholding the international rule of law under multilateralism. As you may know, the headquarters of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong opened officially on October 20. The IOMed is the world's first intergovernmental international legal organisation dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation, and providing an important mechanism for upholding the principles of the Charter of the United Nations (UN). As stated by Mr Wang Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs during the Signing Ceremony of the IOMed Convention held in Hong Kong on May 30 this year, the IOMed is an actualisation of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. It fills an institutional gap in international mediation and serves as an important public good in the field of the rule of law for better global governance.

Apart from the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) of the HCCH, which has been established in Hong Kong by the Hague Conference on Private International Law since 2012. Other international intergovernmental organisations such as the Bank for International Settlements, International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation have set up offices in Hong Kong. Together with the soon-to-be-established office by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, these establishments will further support the city's strategic position as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution. Their presence in Hong Kong is also evidence of our championing multilateralism.

Alongside the physical set-up of institutions akin to building our ""hardware"", Hong Kong also takes in hand capacity building to invest in our ""software"" development. The Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, launched in last year's Hong Kong Legal Week, has been organising practical legal courses, seminars and international exchange programmes both locally and abroad to promote international legal talent exchanges. With the expert committee for the Academy (Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Expert Committee) consisting of three advisory boards, comprising 17 legal experts and scholars from renowned international, Mainland and local legal organisations and universities - and quite a few of them are also speakers at this Forum - the Academy breeds and boosts legal expertise, contributing to the country's vision in upholding the international rule of law under the multilateral paradigm.

Turning to our Session 2, we looked further down to the promotion and development of international law through emerging technologies. We had the benefit of hearing from prominent legal experts and technology experts from international organisations and universities on their insights on various emerging issues of the interface between law and technology, ranging from digitisation, cryptocurrency to artificial intelligence (AI). As technology could be a double-edged sword, bringing out convenience and advancements to our daily lives on the one hand, but causing some unforeseen risks to the future of humankind on the other hand, there is a need for the international community to come together to develope international rules that harness the benefits of emerging technologies while addressing the potential risks.

My department attaches great importance to the development in the areas of lawtech and AI. We have established the Consultation Group on LawTech Development in January this year to research and formulate specific recommendations to promote the use of lawtech. We also believe that forums and exhibitions could provide an important platform for fostering exchange and co-operation. As part of this year's Hong Kong Legal Week, we will hold the inaugural Hong Kong LawTech Fest 2025, due to take place from tomorrow till this Friday. The event will bring together legal practitioners, technology providers, experts, academics, and policymakers to explore the fast-evolving intersection of law and artificial intelligence, and to showcase the latest innovative products and services shaping legal practices. Other than exhibitions presenting innovative lawtech and Al products and services, there will be expert-led sessions on the practical application of Al and lawtech in legal practice, finishing on the last day with a main stage LawTech Conference under the theme ""The AI Era: Shaping the Legal Landscape in the 21st Century"", and you are invited to join the LawTech Fest either in person here at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, or virtually online.

We have also supported the UNCITRAL Asia Pacific Judicial Summit, which took place yesterday and concluded earlier this morning, which centred around the themes of digitalisation and the judicial handling of disputes involving the use of AI. Tomorrow morning, we will also have the HCCH Symposium to look at the operation of certain Hague Conventions in the digital age. You are also most welcome to join the Symposium.

Other than the events that I have just mentioned, my department also contributes to the shaping of international rules amidst emerging technologies by participating in various initiatives in collaboration with international organisations and other institutions. For instance, the DoJ Project Office for Collaboration with UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law), established in November 2020 in the Hong Kong Legal Hub, provides support to the initiatives of the Inclusive Global Legal Innovation Platform on Online Dispute Resolution (iGLIP on ODR), to identify possible future work in respect of online dispute resolution. Experts meet regularly to explore the possibility of developing harmonised standards to ensure the legitimacy of online dispute resolution processes. UNCITRAL in its 58th Commission Session this year endorsed the continued collaboration between UNCITRAL and the iGLIP on ODR. This is an example of proactively developing international rules with foresight, instead of responding after problems arise, in the spirit of the principle of solidarity - which calls for choices and actions to be guided by the interests of the international community as a whole.

In our rather ambitious attempt to navigate in one afternoon through the macro topics of multilateralism and emerging technologies insofar as they relate to the development of international law, I hope you have enjoyed the experts' insights and discussions at today's Legal Forum. As with most dialogues generally, we cannot realistically aim at resolving all the complex issues at one time, but rather, start the conversation and plant some seeds for thought on our minds. As we continue with our yearly exchanges through this Forum, I am confident that this incremental collective and cumulative efforts will no doubt bear fruits as we look back someday in future.

Thank you again for joining us today and I look forward to seeing you at the Forum next year, and perhaps, at the remaining events in our Legal Week."

勞工及福利局局長就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒答問內容（附圖／短片）,2025-12-02 18:50,2025-12-02 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200644.htm,"勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十二月二日）聯同菲律賓移工部部長Hans Leo J. Cacdac就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是孫玉菡的答問內容：

記者：你好，剛才局長提到225名外傭，請問是指印傭和菲傭，還是當局掌握的還有其他國籍的外傭在宏福苑工作？另外想問，剛才有提到必定會確保補償會發放到正確的人手上。現在生還的外傭，是否需要親自向你們申請補償，還是勞工處會找到他們的銀行資料並直接發放給他們？另外就工友的情況，勞工處昨日公布有五位工友身故，其實在現場應該有很多判頭和工友，勞工處現在是否掌握當時有多少名工友在場工作，以及他們的情況如何？有關工友的補助會如何發放給他們？最後，是外勞的情況。是否清楚現場有否保安員、清潔員或一些樓宇維修人員是輸入外勞，並在宏福苑工作？

勞工及福利局局長：讓我逐一回答你的問題。第一，據我們現時掌握，在宏福苑工作的外傭共有235名，當中有94名來自菲律賓以及有141名來自印尼。這一刻我們的資料顯示沒有其他國籍的外傭，但我們會持續更新資料。第二，所有有關外傭的財政支援，我們均會通過勞工處和相關的領事館──主要是菲律賓領事館和印尼領事館作發放。具體詳情我們會與領事館討論，目的是要確保我們提供給外傭的所有援助都可以發放到他們手中。如不幸身亡的，亦需確保可以發放到他們的家人手中，這是十分重要的。我尤其想跟大家分享的是，如剛剛部長所說，菲律賓的法律有相關指定。若有任何身亡，當中如何分發及得到補助，我們是需要跟從的。以菲律賓為例，需要跟從菲律賓的相關法律和做法，我覺得這樣是最妥當的。

至於工友方面，正如你所說，這一刻我們掌握到有五名工友不幸在今次大火中喪生。同時，我也想提供一些資料，對於在這次在火警生還或不受影響的工友，我們也會提供兩萬元的補助。經勞工處這刻的統計，估計共牽涉約二百多位工友，當中估計有一百六十名是建造業的工人。他們在這次大維修工程中，未必每天在這裏工作，但整個工程他也有份工作。而清潔工人應該有19名，保安員亦應該有30名。

此外，我留意到你問關於外勞。以我們的判斷，應該是沒有外勞的。大家都理解，建造業的外勞，全部均是通過發展局的計劃，在工務工程才可以合法申請配額並聘請。這個工程並不屬於工務工程，因此不應該取得任何配額。就清潔員和保安員方面，我亦沒有留意到這些公司曾經申請輸入外勞，這是我們現時掌握的數據。當然，如果有更新的資料，我們必定第一時間跟大家報告，但以我們掌握的資料，應該是沒有外勞牽涉在內。

記者：你好。首先，想請問早前有外勞和勞工團體的聯合聲明指有可疑人士用災民家屬的證件獲利，政府有否收到相關求助或發現這個情況？第二，如果有些外傭的僱主不幸在火災中身故，除了剛剛所提到的補助外，有沒有其他的支援，以及如何安排或協調他們之後的工作？

勞工及福利局局長：我想你指的是外傭。第一，我們要提醒大家，在大火災之餘，我們也留意到有一些可恥的騙徒藉此混水摸魚，大家要小心。這個我們也有和領事館仔細討論，也是為何我們一定要通過領事館派發給外傭的補助金，這是第一點。第二點是如果外傭的僱主不幸在這次大火裏身故的話，我們會彈性地、人性化地處理他們轉換僱主的要求，這個我們和入境處已經溝通了，入境處也會提供最大的幫助。事實上，入境處現時已針對外傭的身分證明文件及僱傭合約在大火中燒毀的情況提供緊急服務，讓外傭可以盡快補辦他們的身分證明文件；另外在協助外傭取回一份我們官方認可的僱傭合約方面，我們現在已經在處理了。

記者：剛才提到可能有外傭康復後想轉僱主，如有些僱主是幸存下來的，外傭轉工時是否能獲人性化的安排？可否舉例讓大家知道，外傭是否不用回到原本的國家再回港，或是有甚麼措施？

勞工及福利局局長：大原則是入境處會人性化處理受影響外傭，現時很難一刀切一概而論。大家可以放心，入境處已經向我們表示，會因應每一名外傭的具體處境，作人性化處理。請大家放心。"
Remarks by SLW at media session regarding follow-up work on fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po (with photo/video),2025-12-02 18:50,2025-12-02 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200645.htm,"  The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media today (December 2) with the Secretary for Migrant Workers of the Philippines, Mr Hans Leo J. Cacdac, regarding the follow-up work on the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Following are Mr Sun's remarks at the media session:

Reporter: Good afternoon, Mr Sun. You mentioned that there will be $800,000 offered to the deceased foreign domestic helpers. Would this be for their families? And how can the families claim this amount of money? And also, who will be responsible for the funeral expenses of the helpers who lost their lives in this tragedy? Is it still the employer in this case?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. We are working closely with the Consulate for those who are going to claim assistance from us. We will work through for the Filipinos with the PCG - the Consul Generals of the Philippines. Number one is to identify and to confirm that they are the ones, and then we are going to distribute through the Labour Department (LD) in Hong Kong where we will work with the Consulate. The key is to make sure that only the genuine family members are eligible to claim the financial assistance for those helpers who died in the incident. Rest assured, we will work closely with the Consulate to make sure that the money is distributed to the right people. I think this is very important.

  For the funeral expenses, there are two parts of it. One part is already covered by the statutory requirement. For all the standard contracts we are issuing for every domestic helper in Hong Kong, there is a standard clause to cover funeral expenses. On top of the existing legal provision, we also provide them with a one-off non-accountable $50,000 relating to their funeral. This is an additional add-on.

Reporter: Thank you, Mr Sun, for the generous support for migrant domestic workers. Indeed, the payout is generous enough. I would just like to ask if this is separate from whatever employee compensation that our migrant workers are entitled to under the law, because right now as I know it stands at more than $500,000 in case of death, and there are separate provisions for those who are injured. If they are entitled to this, will the Hong Kong LD assist them in claiming for their compensation? Thank you.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: You can rest assured, as I have made clear in my opening remarks, the LD will help them claim the entitlement under the law. As you said, for those who died, they are entitled to receive at least around $500,000 as compensation. You can rest assured that we will do our utmost to make sure they receive it. What I am saying is, apart from what is provided under the law, this time around, there will be an extra one-off financial assistance, which amounts to $250,000 for those who died.

Reporter: Thank you very much. For those migrant domestic workers among the survivors, if some of them are recovering, and for example they do not have any more employment with their employers in Tai Po, would they be given an extension of their 14-day visas in order to look for a job if they wish to continue their employment in Hong Kong?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. We have discussed this with the Immigration Department, so you can have reassurance that they will be as flexible as possible to help the workers. It depends on each and every individual case, but please be assured that we will be as flexible and helpful as possible to help those who are affected and tragically impacted."
EDB facilitates early resumption of face-to-face classes of Tai Po Baptist Public School,2025-12-02 18:27,2025-12-02 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200642.htm,"âA spokesman for the Education Bureau (EDB) today (December 2) announced that the school premises of Tai Po Baptist Public School (TPBPS) will remain closed for a certain period of time due to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po last week. In order to facilitate early resumption of the normal teaching routine of TPBPS and provide proper care for the students, the EDB has co-ordinated with schools in Tai Po District to deploy available classrooms and successfully arranged for TPBPS students to attend classes by grade level at the school premises of Tai Po Government Primary School and N.T.W.J.W.A Christian Remembrance of Grace Primary School from the middle of this month.

For the next two weeks, TPBPS has arranged for students to resume classes in various modes, including attending classes in classrooms of schools in Tai Po District and participating in learning activities in different venues. The school has announced the arrangements to the parents.

The EDB spokesman said, ""As the school sponsoring body of government primary schools, the EDB fully supports Tai Po Government Primary School in lending out its classrooms. The EDB is also very grateful for the support and co-operation of N.T.W.J.W.A Christian Remembrance of Grace Primary School in assisting affected students to resume their studies.""

勞工及福利局局長就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（附圖／短片）,2025-12-02 18:24,2025-12-02 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200618.htm,"勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十二月二日）聯同菲律賓移工部部長Hans Leo J. Cacdac就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是孫玉菡的開場發言：

非常感謝菲律賓移工部部長再次來到香港，上次我們見面是在十一月九日，當時部長來香港主持一個位於金鐘為香港菲律賓工人而設的中心，這次很感謝他再來到，我們衷誠傾談，也得到他大力支持。我向他解釋了今次宏福苑大火中不幸身故的外傭會得到我們法定的補償，初步估計超過50萬元。除此之外，他們會得到一次性20萬元慰問金及5萬元補助，我們估計在這次大火中每名不幸身故的外傭約可得到80萬元的補償。

至於在今次大火中受傷的外傭，同樣我們會提供5萬或10萬元的補助，慰問金的金額視乎其在醫院逗留的時間長短而定。除此之外，所有在這次大火中得以逃生的外傭，我們均會提供2萬元的慰問金。另外，無論是受傷或是曾經在宏福苑工作，現時是安全的外傭，我們會提供每人一張面值兩千元的八達通卡。這些我跟部長溝通了，部長也對於我們的工作表示感謝。

另外我想藉這個機會跟大家說一說，最近大家留意到宏福苑大火發生後，很多社福機構第一時間到現場，提供他們力所能及的援助，大多是現金援助。由於時間匆匆，他們很多在現場進行派發，大家都是出於一片善意，希望盡快幫助受影響的居民。但無論是善團或者政府均留意到這樣的做法，對於居民來說就要不斷填表，認為影響了他們的生活。

所以今天我和十間香港主要大的慈善團體見面，談到很多關於救災工作，以及如何派發善款的安排。大家一致同意，已經進行派發的當然先完成，將來而言大家仍有有很多不同類型的資助想派給受影響的居民，請他們全部通過「一戶一社工」處理，意味隨着「一戶一社工」的落實，其實每一名社工都掌握了要幫助的住戶的資料，即不需要再請住戶作申請。我們會有小組作對應，只要團體表明清楚其資助辦法，譬如不幸身故或受傷會提供多少資助、各類型資助為何，相關社工會按其資助條件和內容，跟住戶溝通後自動替住戶作申請，整個申請流程由社工去做。住戶只需要簽名，當資助金通過支票或不同類型的發放模式，我們的同事、社工或相關的公務員會聯絡住戶，可親自把支票送到其居住的地方，或按照他們方便的方法，替他們處理收到的善款。

當然我們理解除了我們慣常接觸的大型慈善團體以外，香港有很多不同類型的慈善團體都想出一分力，如果我們發現有團體想在現場設置攤位，或者有類近想法時，我們會第一時間打電話聯絡團體，提醒其實不需要透過現場形式要大家填表，可以通過「一戶一社工」幫助處理所有這些大家善心想幫居民的捐助和財政的支援。我藉此機會，呼籲全港不同的慈善團體，希望可以做到一站式，省卻居民要不斷填表的需要，在這方面我們希望可以盡快為他們提供最好的幫助。到此我把時間交給部長。"
Opening remarks by SLW at media session regarding follow-up work on fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po (with photo/video),2025-12-02 18:24,2025-12-02 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200610.htm," The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media today (December 2) with the Secretary for Migrant Workers of the Philippines, Mr Hans Leo J. Cacdac, regarding the follow-up work on the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Following are Mr Sun's opening remarks at the media session:

 Today the Secretary for Migrant Workers of the Philippines is coming to Hong Kong. This is the second time we have met in Hong Kong. The last time we met was on November 9 - the Secretary came to Hong Kong to officiate at the opening of the largest centre in Asia for Filipinos in Hong Kong.

 First of all, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the families of the deceased foreign domestic helpers. At the same time, I wish a very speedy recovery to all those injured in the fire. We are truly grateful for their selflessness and also their heroic acts during the fire, as many of them were taking care of the elderly, children and babies in Wang Fuk Court.

 Let me briefly sum up the support we are going to provide for those who unfortunately died or were injured. For foreign domestic helpers who died in the fire, apart from the statutory compensation, which will be over $500,000, they will also be receiving one-off financial assistance of $200,000, and another $50,000 of support. Adding all together, for foreign domestic helpers who died in the fire, they will be receiving around $800,000, roughly equivalent to US$100,000.

 For those who were injured, they will also be receiving one-off financial assistance, either $50,000 or $100,000, depending on the period of how long they are staying in the hospital. For those who survived the fire, we will also provide $20,000 to them. And for those who were injured or survived the fire, we are also providing them with an Octopus card with an amount of $2,000.

 Let me also give a quick update on the number of foreign domestic helpers in Wang Fuk Court. According to the information available to us, there are a total of 235 foreign domestic helpers working in Wang Fuk court. Among them, according to our record, 10 died in the fire, three are injured, 192 are safe now, and there are still 30 who are missing."
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-12-02 18:20,2025-12-02 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200621.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 2) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP urged parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccinations also reduce the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

  The case involves a 6-month-old girl with underlying illness. She developed a fever on November 29 and was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of North District Hospital on the same day. She was admitted to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital for treatment. Due to the worsening of her symptoms, she was subsequently transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit of Princess Margaret Hospital. She is currently in serious condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A (H1) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis is influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia and septic shock.

  The girl has not yet received the 2025/26 SIV and had no travel history during the incubation period. Two of her household contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms recently, but did not require hospitalisation.

  Including the abovementioned case, there have been 24 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including three fatal cases. The affected children were aged six months to 17 years. A total of 15 cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

  ""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity has gradually declined since late October. However, it remains above the baseline thresholds. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged six months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged six months to under two years is relatively low, at 18 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Head of Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, said.

  He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

  Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

  In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

衞生防護中心調查一宗產志賀毒素大腸桿菌感染輸入個案,2025-12-02 17:40,2025-12-02 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200571.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二日）公布，正調查一宗產志賀毒素大腸桿菌感染輸入個案，並提醒市民保持良好個人、食物及環境衞生，以預防腸道感染。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的14歲男童，他於十一月十六日出現肚瀉和腹部不適，十一月十八日向私家醫生求醫，無需入院，現時已康復。他的糞便樣本經化驗後，證實含產志賀毒素大腸桿菌。

初步調查顯示，病人於十一月十日至十五日（潛伏期內）參加學校旅行到訪印度尼西亞峇里。根據資料，參與學校旅行的其餘33名師生和病人的同住家人至今沒有出現病徵，中心正跟進他們的健康情況。中心會繼續調查個案。

過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年），中心每年錄得一至六宗產志賀毒素大腸桿菌感染個案。計及上述公布的個案，今年至今共錄得三宗產志賀毒素大腸桿菌感染個案，並沒有發現明顯上升趨勢或不尋常的群組個案。

一般而言，產志賀毒素大腸桿菌感染多與進食或飲用受污染的食品或水有關，例如生或未經充分煮熟的肉類、受污染的蔬果或未經消毒的奶製品。同時，該細菌亦可藉由糞口途徑在人與人之間傳播。來自被污染的飲用水和遊憩用水的水源性傳播均曾有報告。市民應注意個人及食物衞生。

CHP investigates imported case of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection,2025-12-02 17:40,2025-12-02 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200573.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced today (December 2) that it is investigating an imported case of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection and reminded members of the public to maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent intestinal infections.

The case involves a 14-year-old boy with good past health who developed diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort on November 16. He sought medical attention at aprivate doctor on November 18 and did not require hospitalisation. He has now recovered. His stool sample tested positive for STEC.

A preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the patient participated in a school trip to Bali, Indonesia, between November 10 and 15 (within the incubation period). According to available information, the remaining 33 students and teachers who participated in the school trip and the patient’s home contacts are asymptomatic so far. The CHP is following up on their health conditions and will continue to investigate the case.

Over the past five years (2020 to 2024), the CHP recorded one to six cases of STEC infection annually. Including the case announced above, three cases of STEC infection have been recorded so far this year. No significant upward trend or unusual cluster cases have been identified.

Generally, STEC infections are usually associated with the consumption of contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat products, contaminated fruits and vegetables, and unpasteurised dairy products. Direct person-to-person transmission through the faecal-oral route can also occur. Waterborne transmission has been reported, both from contaminated drinking water and from recreational waters. The public are advised to observe good personal and food hygiene.

About 800 Chinese Medicine (CM) experts, academics, health officials and industry representatives from Hong Kong, the Mainland, Macao and overseas attended the Conference to exchange views on the future direction of the global development of traditional medicine, clinical services and scientific research development of CM, modernisation research of traditional medicine, and Chinese medicines (CMs) standards.

Distinguished guests for the opening session included the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau; the World Health Organization Regional Director for the Western Pacific, Dr Saia Ma'u Piukala; the Director General of the Science and Technology Department of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Mr Chen Ronghu; the Deputy Director-General of the Health Commission of Guangdong Province and Director of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Bureau of Guangdong Province (TCMBGD), Mr Qiu Yahong; the Director of the Health Bureau of the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) Government, Dr Lo Iek-long; and the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam.

Before the start of the Conference, all participants stood up and observed a moment of silence to mourn the victims of the Tai Po fire. In his opening remarks, Professor Lo expressed particular condolences for the victims and the deceased fireman, as well as extended sympathies to their families and affected residents. He also paid tribute to the personnel who took part in the rescue mission, in particular firefighters, police officers and healthcare colleagues, and wished the injured a speedy recovery. ""Healthcare is vital to people's lives and well-being, as well as national security. In the face of major sudden disasters, Hong Kong's public healthcare system has taken up the primary responsibility of emergency response and treatment. The Health Bureau is co-ordinating the efforts of both public and private medical sectors to provide comprehensive healthcare protection to the injured and all affected residents,"" he stressed.

This year's Conference has its theme of ""Greater Bay Area: Traditional Medicine, Global Vision"". Professor Lo said, ""CM experts from various regions gathered at the Conference to explore fostering CM to go global with the collaborative innovation strengths of the GBA, with a view to contributing to the health of all mankind. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has long been committed to promoting the development of CM and assisting the national drive for CM to go global. Among them, two flagship institutions for CM development, namely The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) and the permanent premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute, will commence services on December 11. They will help drive the development of CM services, professional training, scientific research and innovation, standard-setting, and international co-operation, demonstrating the value and strengths of CM to the world. Furthermore, the CM Development Blueprint will also be released to set out a clear direction for CM development in Hong Kong, with a view to fostering high-quality and high-standard development of CM on all fronts.""

Themed ""Global Development of Traditional Medicine: Policy Support, Research and Innovation, and Regional Collaboration"", the plenary forum of the Conference explored how scientific innovation and cross-regional collaboration can facilitate the deeper integration of traditional medicine into modern healthcare systems. Three parallel forums were held afterwards to discuss (1) CM services, including CM-predominant clinical services and its scientific research development, standardisation of CM services, and the establishment of CMHHK; (2) modernisation research on traditional medicine, covering herbal medicine quality standards, clinical evidence for traditional medicine, and interactions between herbal and pharmaceutical substances; and (3) the development of CMs standardisation, including CMs standards research and setting, challenges in applying CMs standards in practice, and feasibility of inter-regional harmonisation. At the Conference, CMHHK signed strategic collaboration agreements with various provincial-level hospitals and international institutions, and multiple CM co-operation projects within the GBA were also signed.

At the closing session of the Conference, the Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, delivered concluding remarks. The next conference will be hosted by the Macao SAR Government.

The Conference was jointly organised by the Health Bureau, the TCMBGD, and the Health Bureau of the Macao SAR Government, with the Department of Health, the Hospital Authority and CMHHK as co-organisers."
再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-12-02 17:30,2025-12-02 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200568.htm,"​​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二日）再接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案。中心呼籲家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的六個月大女童。她於十一月二十九日出現發燒，同日被帶往北區醫院急症室求診，獲安排於雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院留院治療，因病情惡化，其後被轉到瑪嘉烈醫院兒童深切治療部留醫，目前情況嚴重。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H1）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發嚴重肺炎和敗血性休克。

女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗，於潛伏期內不曾外遊。她的兩名家居接觸者近日曾出現呼吸道病徵，病況輕微，無需住院。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得24宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的15宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度自十月下旬起逐漸下降，但仍高於基線水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，六個月至兩歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有18%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Customs officers intercepted a 48-year-old incoming female passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (December 1). A total of 37 600 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $169,000 and a duty potential of about $124,000, were seized from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

One man was arrested.

Through risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Customs officers on November 30 inspected an air consignment, declared as wash mitts and arriving in Hong Kong from France, at the airport. Upon examination, Customs officers found about 10kg of suspected ketamine concealed inside the consignment.

After follow-up investigations, Customs officers mounted a controlled delivery operation yesterday (December 1) and arrested a 44-year-old male consignee in Wong Tai Sin. The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and he will appear at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (December 3).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people, nor to release their personal data or home address to others for receiving parcels or goods.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

The monthly mean relative humidity of 60 per cent was 12 per cent below the normal of 72 per cent and one of the fourth lowest on record for November. The total rainfall for the month was 7.0 millimetres, only about 18 per cent of the normal of 39.3 millimetres. The accumulated rainfall this year up to November was 2 552.2 millimetres, about 6 per cent above the normal of 2 402.4 millimetres for the same period. The monthly mean temperature of 22.3 degrees was near the normal of 22.2 degrees. Mainly attributed to the exceptionally hot weather in September and October, the autumn of the year from September to November was much warmer than usual. The autumn mean minimum temperature of 24.4 degrees, mean temperature of 26.3 degrees and mean maximum temperature of 28.9 degrees were respectively one of the second highest, the third highest and one of the fourth highest on record for the same period.

 Under the influence of the northeast monsoon, it was dry with sunny intervals on the first two days of the month. With a band of clouds covering southern China, local weather turned cloudy with one or two light rain patches on November 3 and 4. While there were sunny periods on November 5 and 6, gloomy and rainy weather returned on November 7 with a band of clouds covering southern China. As an anticyclone aloft strengthened gradually, the weather turned generally fine during the day on November 8 and remained so in the following two days. With plenty of sunshine, the temperature at the Observatory rose to a maximum of 28.9 degrees on November 9, the highest of the month.

  Additionally, the tropical depression to the south of Guam intensified into a tropical storm on the morning of November 6 and was named Fung-wong. Fung-wong continued to move generally northwestwards and intensified progressively into a super typhoon in the following three days. It moved across Luzon on the morning of November 10 and weakened into a typhoon. Fung-wong turned to move northwards over the northeastern part of the South China Sea on November 11 and weakened gradually under the influence of the northeast monsoon. It skirted the southern part of Taiwan the next night and weakened into an area of low pressure with frontal characteristics.

 Under the combined effect of Fung-wong and the northeast monsoon, local winds occasionally reached strong force offshore and on high ground on November 10 and 11. The outer rainbands of Fung-wong brought a few light rain patches on November 11. There was also minor flooding over some low-lying areas during the high tide on the night of November 10 and the early morning of November 11. Dominated by a dry northeast monsoon, apart from the cloudier weather with a few rain patches on November 13 and the next morning, the weather in Hong Kong was generally fine and dry from November 12 to 17.

 A cold front reached the coast of southern China on the early morning of November 18. Under the influence of the associated intense northeast monsoon, the weather became appreciably cooler and windy during the day and the next day. The temperature at the Observatory dropped to a minimum of 13.2 degrees on the morning of November 19, the lowest of the month. The weather remained very dry in the following three days. The relative humidity over most parts of the territory stayed below 40 per cent on November 20 and 21. With the band of clouds thinning out, cloudy weather on November 19 and 20 turned generally fine during the day on November 21 and remained so in the following three days.

 A strong replenishment of the northeast monsoon reached the coast of southern China on November 25. The weather was generally fine and very dry on November 25 and 26. With another replenishment reaching the coastal areas of Guangdong, the weather remained generally fine and very dry on November 27 and the next two days. The relative humidity at the Observatory once fell to 16 per cent on November 27, equalling the lowest on record in November since the establishment of the automatic weather station at the Observatory's Headquarters in 1984. With a band of clouds covering southern China on the last day of the month, while the weather remained dry locally, it was mainly cloudy with one or two light rain patches at night.

 Four tropical cyclones occurred over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific in November 2025.

 Details of issuance and cancellation of various warnings/signals in the month are summarised in Table 1. Monthly meteorological figures and departures from normal for November are tabulated in Table 2."
Remarks by CE at media session before ExCo (with video),2025-12-02 15:40,2025-12-02 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200489.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at a media session before the Executive Council meeting today (December 2):

Reporter: Two questions. First, can you first confirm whether three people, including a student, a former District Councillor and a volunteer, have been arrested for sedition, and if so, what did they do that was seditious? My second question is, over the past few years, you have spoken about leading Hong Kong from chaos to order and from order to prosperity, and yet this prosperous society allowed 151 people to burn to death. Can you tell us why you deserve to keep your job?

Chief Executive: Criminals who commit offences must be taken to justice. When law enforcement agencies discover crimes, whatever their natures are, they must be dealt with in accordance with the law. Whoever they are, whatever their background is, if their acts contravene the law, law enforcement agencies must take action, and they have a duty to do so. I emphasise, I will not tolerate any crimes, particularly crimes that exploit the tragedy that we are facing now. Everybody in Hong Kong society is uniting to help those who suffer to continue their living and face up to the future. To anybody who dares to sabotage this attempt - this commitment of society - we will do anything we can to ensure that justice will be done.

  Yes, it is a tragedy; it is a big fire. Yes, we need a reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plugged so that those who are responsible will be accountable, the shortcomings will be addressed, the bottlenecks will be addressed, and we will reform the whole building renovation system to ensure that such things will not happen again.

  Nobody, of course, wants a fire to happen. We will do our best; it has been the effort of the Government, of everybody in society, of everybody involved in this area to do their best. Fires happen in different cities, despite different cities' governments and communities having tried their best. We will do our best to prevent it, but it is exactly what the Government must do now to ensure that some system failures, which may have been accumulating over years, are addressed. We need to strengthen the system. We need to reform it. We need to ensure vested interests will not be allowed to be a factor that causes this tragedy.

  There are a number of factors, and I have explained to you the different areas that we must tackle and the different issues that we have identified. We will work on each one of them - not a single one of them, but each and every one of them - and we are willing to listen to more views or opinions about what they have discovered. This will be included in the investigation and also included in the review to be conducted.

  I just want to assure you of one other thing. This is a time for everybody to unite for a good purpose, but for anybody who tries to sabotage the commitment of society, I will do all I can to ensure justice is done.

Reporter: Good morning, Mr Lee. First, can you detail more in English in terms of what is the way forward for the investigations into the fire in Tai Po? And secondly, how is the Government going to ensure that all the funds and public donations and every resource that the Government has received or the public has given would actually reach those affected and help them, including, say, foreign domestic helpers. Thank you.

Chief Executive: For investigations into this fire, there is quite a number of investigations. Because we are to ensure that justice is done, we want to ensure that we will prevent such a tragedy from happening again. So first of all, there's a serious investigation to ascertain the cause of the fire and why it developed at such a high speed, causing such serious deaths and injuries. That is being conducted by a professional team led by the Fire Services Department with law enforcement agencies, particularly the Police.

There is also an investigation into those who we have been ascertained at this level to be accountable. These include 13 people arrested by the Police for suspected manslaughter, and also 12 people arrested by the ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption) for corrupt practices which relate to this tragedy. Both investigations reveal that the responsible culprits tried to mix up substandard nets with qualified nets so as to cheat inspection and law enforcement agencies. The modus operandi of criminals change every day. They are evil. They are cunning.

But I thank the law enforcement agencies for doing all they can to overcome these challenges and keep digging, leaving no stone unturned. So I urge this joint investigation by the Police and the ICAC to proceed as fast as possible, so that those responsible should be charged in court as soon as possible. And I also want them to investigate, to see whether there will be other people involved in any related capacity, so that anybody who should be held accountable should be held accountable, and justice is seen to be done, so they will let the dead rest in peace, let society see that justice is done.

I have identified a large number of areas where issues should be addressed, because this tragic fire reflects significant lapses in the building works from construction to supervision with multiple points of failure, and we must implement systemic reform, and the issues identified include:

First, the safety requirements, standards, supervision and routine maintenance systems for building maintenance works;

Second, systemic issues in the construction process, such as inappropriate connected interests, conflicts of roles and corrupt collusion;

Third, establishing an up-to-date list of materials for which safety standards are properly set, their review and updating, the required verification and testing systems;

Fourth, examining the roles and responsibilities of regulatory personnel across all stages of the project chain, including government departments and authorised professionals;

Fifth, issues of corruption, bid-rigging and irregular tendering in building maintenance projects;

Sixth, the supervision and responsibility for the installation and effective operation of fire safety systems in buildings;

Seventh, accountability related to the above areas, in the fire in Tai Po;

Eighth, the adequacy, or otherwise, of legislation and penalties.

I call for a thorough investigation and serious reform. We will overcome the obstacles of vested interests, pursue accountability regardless of who he or she is. We must uncover the truth, ensure that justice is served, let the deceased rest in peace and provide comfort to the living.

Therefore, while criminal and fire investigations are proceeding continuously, I will establish an independent committee to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth review to reform the building works system and prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future. To ensure the committee's independence and credibility, I will invite a judge to lead its work. I shall liaise with him to define its detailed terms of reference, and at the same time, I will explore ways to assist in supporting the committee's operational efficiency such that the Government can provide more detailed information or carry out some work on its direction so as to enable it to complete its task efficiently and submit a report early to the Chief Executive with recommendations to assist the Government to make the reform.

Regarding all the donations, I must thank everybody, all the donors, for their kindness, sincerity and commitment to help us, to help Hong Kong as a whole, to help, particularly, those who suffered in this fire to recover their lives and also to ensure that they will continue to look ahead and live their lives. We'll ensure all the resources are well put on them to ensure they will live through this difficult time and also recover their new lives. We will, of course, publish clearly the account of the use of money, but there will be a lot of work that we need to do. We'll continue to talk to the victims, the families and those affected, to listen to their wishes and wants to see how we can help to ensure that they can continue to live a normal life. I sincerely urge and request every one of us to unite to help them, to unite to make the reform, to unite to take those responsible to justice, and also to create a common will to make Hong Kong a better home for everybody. Thank you.

​行政長官於行政會議前會見傳媒開場發言及答問內容（附短片）,2025-12-02 15:36,2025-12-02 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200488.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十二月二日）上午出席行政會議前會見傳媒的開場發言及答問內容：

行政長官：各位市民、各位傳媒朋友，上星期，在大埔宏福苑我們經歷了一場慘痛的奪命大火。這場火焚燒的不只是七座樓宇，還深深刺痛我們每一位香港人的心。不少人失去了身邊的親人、朋友，我們亦失去了一位英勇的消防員。

經過連續多日不分晝夜的救火和救援行動，消防人員完成了滅火和搜救工作，從火場中成功拯救了不少居民。這些生命奇跡是消防人員用生命守護回來，我首先向爭分奪秒、救命扶傷的消防人員致敬、致以無盡的感謝。我們亦感謝不同崗位各人員各司其職：醫護人員盡心盡力拯救每一位傷者；警務人員在現場維持秩序和配合救火的工作，之後全速行動，投入後續搜證、調查、遺體辨認等工作；還有不辭勞苦的前線人員、公務員和熱心市民，不同人士今次都展現出我們香港人同是一家，互愛互助、無私付出，團結一致。

火災至今已導致151人喪生，79人受傷。傷者當中，40人仍然留醫，警方已聯絡或排除了多個報稱失聯個案，現在正跟進餘下約30個失聯個案。

我們懷着極度悲傷的心情度過了過去幾日，政府建築物下半旗悼念，不少市民到政府在全港18區設立的弔唁處簽署弔唁冊悼念，到大埔獻花表達哀思。

政府全力照顧和支援受影響居民，協助他們度過最艱難時期。火災後，政府啓動庇護中心安置流離失所的大埔宏福苑居民，隨後陸續安排他們共2 500人轉移至過渡性房屋、香港房屋協會單位、青年宿舍、酒店等暫住，現在有約20名人士仍留在庇護中心。我們啓動「一戶一社工」支援受影響居民，再額外安排每戶二至三名公務員提供支援，確保每一戶都得到專人照顧、解答疑問、安撫情緒、協助做跑腿等。我和多位司局長到過渡性房屋探訪，我問候災民時，他們對政府提供的物資、服務和津貼感滿意。我亦聽到有說收到詐騙短訊，要求提供銀行戶口資料以領取津貼，我提醒他們應該找政府的「一戶一社工」或協助他們的公務員。我在這裏譴責這些卑鄙的欺騙行為。

資金支援方面，政府向每戶受影響的居民即時提供一萬元現金應急錢傍身。從本星期開始亦陸續向每戶家庭派發五萬元生活津貼。我們亦就每名死者提供二十萬元慰問金給家屬。昨天我們又宣布提供補助金五或十萬給受傷住院的人士、二萬元補助金給學生、工友和倖存的外傭。政府會和他們共渡時艱。

大火無情，人間有愛，廣大香港市民及不同機構紛紛伸出援手，用不同方式向受影響居民提供支援。政府成立「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，投入三億元啓動資金，隨後收到民間的大量捐款，包括內地同胞，基金累計總額已達到16億元。這些捐款匯聚各方的愛心、力量和期盼，政府會確保這些捐款全數用好在協助居民走出困境、重過新生活上。

我早前宣布成立三個工作組，其中的調查及規管工作組正馬不停蹄徹查真相，追究責任，為死者討回公道。消防處牽頭的跨部門調查專組，正在深入調查大火事故原因。警方已拘捕13人涉嫌誤殺，廉政公署亦就宏福苑大維修工程涉嫌貪污拘捕12人。調查證實裝修工程涉舞弊，有預謀地用不合規的非阻燃圍網和一些合規圍網混合起來魚目混珠，加上工程用了大量易燃的發泡膠，是導致火勢一觸即發，迅速蔓延的關鍵原因。我希望警方和廉署的聯合調查能早日完成，盡快把疑犯控訴到法庭，同時調查其他關連的人，把所有須負上責任的人都繩之於法。

我要求調查到底，認真改革，化悲憤為改革力量，打破利益藩籬，不論涉及任何人都一問到底，追責到底。我們要讓真相水落石出，讓公義得到伸張，讓逝者安息，讓生者安心。這場大火反映維修建築工程從施工到監督，都出現嚴重疏忽，多個環節都出現失誤的問題，我們必須作系統性改革。這些問題包括：

一、樓宇維修工程的施工安全要求、標準、監督和日常維護制度；
二、有關工程各環節有否不適當的相連利益、角色衝突、不當的合謀串連等系統問題；
三、針對樓宇維修工程，現行安全標準的用料清單是否全面，有關的驗證和檢測制度是否有效；
四、各環節的監管人員的角色和責任承擔，包括政府部門和授權負責的專業人士等；
五、大廈維修工程可能涉貪圍標，違規招標的問題；
六、大廈須配置的消防系統及其有效運作所須的監督和責任問題；
七、大火中就上述範圍的相關責任；
八、法律和懲罰的足夠性。

在刑事調查、火因調查馬不停蹄進行的同時，為防止同類悲劇再次發生，我會成立由一名法官主持的獨立委員會，審視事故的起火和迅速蔓延的原因及相關問題。

我會聯繫司法機構，邀請一名法官主持委員會的工作，研究詳細的工作範圍。同時我會研究協助委員會高效運作，包括政府如何提供更多委員會所需資料及按其要求執行某些工作，以提供更多支持，協助其盡早完成工作，向行政長官提交建議和報告，助力政府深化改革。

同時，我們的救援工作不會停頓，不會遺留任何一個人，不會放棄任何一個家庭。我們會協助受影響的家庭重建家園，盡快回復正常生活。而在災後支援和重建的關鍵時刻，我們必須放眼長遠，堅定前行，穩步推進社會的正常運作。

各位，我已作出決定，原定於十二月七日舉行的立法會選舉將如期舉行。於過去一段時期，我部署和指示了滅火救援，治理傷者，設計援助方案和制度方向，設立援助基金，推動捐獻，安置災民，指示協助家庭辦理後續事宜及就事件作全面調查等。在我思考下一步援助災民和防範同類事情發生的過程中，我想起改革征程，想起改革夥伴，我最需要的改革夥伴必然是立法會議員，他們都經歷了這次大火，感受了共同的傷痛，必然會和政府一起共同推動改革，盡職審核撥款，制訂有關法律等，選出有抱負、有能力的立法會議員是重建路上重要的一步；支援和跟進工作不會停止，改革的步伐不能停頓；我們必須前行，才能化悲痛為力量。

如期完成立法會選舉，是對憲制秩序和法治精神的遵守和尊重。選舉日期具有法定性，選舉有指定程序，必須按法律要求進行。如期完成選舉，亦是對社會穩定的維護，更是對災後重建工作的有力支撐。讓新一屆議員盡早履職，才能更快、更有效地推進包括災後的重要工作，善後支援、復原重建，和涉及的法例制定檢討和改革等，很多工作都需要經立法會審議、批准撥款和制定法律才能落實，這是對香港未來最負責任的態度。

新當選的立法會議員在經歷了這場重大悲痛後進入議會，對他們而言，是一次深刻的使命啓示。政府將與新一屆立法會帶着相同的理念和改革的意向，立即投入工作。今次大火，必然帶來種種的政策和制度反思，讓新當選的立法會議員盡快就任，能讓他們與政府攜手以修例和撥款實踐制度改革。

在災難面前，我們經歷了失去的苦澀，也要磨練前行的毅力。困難壓不倒我們，只會讓我們更堅強；挑戰阻不到前路，只會讓我們更團結。我們必須並肩前行，重建希望，在悲痛之中凝聚力量。讓我們以行動，實踐香港的團結精神，共同建設更美好的香港家園，「寫下那不朽香江名句」。多謝大家。

記者：夏主任以港澳工作領導小組副組長身分，南下深圳聽匯報，當中有甚麼含意，特首自己有否參與其中？如果有的話，議題是否包括這次大火，以至立法會選舉？夏主任會否有甚麼信息帶給香港市民？接下來選舉會如期舉行，政府同時忙於支援和善後災民，會否擔心兩方面工作難以兼顧？特別是動員公務員協助居民，人手調配上會否面對一些挑戰？

行政長官：今次的世紀大火奪去151條性命，全香港關注、中央關注，習近平主席已經表示高度重視，亦指示了全力支援香港救災救援。夏寶龍主任（中央港澳工作辦公室主任、國務院港澳事務辦公室主任）履行習近平主席救災救援的精神，派出了由農融副主任（中央港澳工作辦公室副主任、國務院港澳事務辦公室副主任）所帶領的救災援助隊到香港，我非常感謝。夏主任對香港這次災情的關心，我深切體會到，亦感謝在我們提出各種物資方面的支援、經過港澳辦的統籌後，已經有兩批來到香港，包括之前在滅火時所需，甚至現正進行的屍體辨認工作中，照明系統、無人機，甚至在醫療方面提供一些醫耗物品，例如救傷用具等，充分表現了中央高度重視這次災情，全力支援我們的工作。我亦跟夏主任溝通過，他全力支持特區政府的救災救援工作，他亦肯定了我們所做的工作，亦會繼續支援和支持我們在救災方面的工作。

至於選舉方面，我已經充分向大家講解了如期進行立法會選舉的重要性，尤其是我會全心全意推動改革。在改革過程中，最關鍵的夥伴就是立法會議員，所以盡快選出有抱負、有能力的立法會議員，共同和政府推行改革，是非常重要，所以我們會全力去做好選舉工作。但我亦強調，我們的支援工作不會停頓，協助災民的努力不會減少，只會增加。而當我們完成立法會選舉，我們更可以聚精會神，全力幫助災民，屆時的力量不只是政府、不只是有心的廣大市民，更加是真真正正在憲制上有權力的立法會議員，包括撥款、制訂法律，改革整個系統，亦要經過立法會。所以，如果我們和立法會在互相配合、互相制衡、行政主導的原則下，共同為香港建設更美好的家園，防止這些悲劇再發生，我覺得是必須的。我們會進行選舉工作，不會讓任何救援工作停頓，我們只會加快步伐。

記者：你好。宏福苑最新調查結果顯示這些不合標準的棚網樣本是在一些很難觸及的地方檢取，其實是否代表現在全港有棚網的地方，即使是之前已經取得一些證書認證，或者被政府抽查化驗是合符標準的，都不是百分百合規或者安全？剛才提到雖然樓宇工程要改革，亦都要靠市民去自律，但政府作為把關人，其實能否排除不是有巡查部門草率了，制度上是否有一些漏洞要填補？剛才說到的獨立調查委員會稍後會否公開整份報告？最快何時會有第一階段結果？第二，剛才亦有提到選舉會如期舉行，為甚麼不考慮運用現有條例給予的空間去押後？社會現在暫時都瀰漫着一個悲痛的情緒，會否擔心觀感上沒有考慮到死者家屬的感受？謝謝。

行政長官：今次調查已經發現有一些違法人士有預謀地把合規和不合規的圍網混合使用，混水摸魚。

我相信在這麼多的維修工程中，肯定有工程是合規的。調查顯示，可能有一部分的確有一些違背良心、天理不容的違法行為，我們已經拘捕了十多人涉嫌誤殺，拘捕了十多人涉嫌貪污。我們現時正作出巡查，屋宇署亦在三百多幢樓宇進行了巡查，有圍網的地方亦已經取樣。我要求發展局在取樣的樣本化驗後，盡快將結果公布。

無良的人就等於我們每日在社會見到的罪犯，全世界每個城市都有一些邪惡的人犯法，所以每個城市都存在犯罪數字，我們要努力打擊。

今次，我們認為在缺失方面涉及不同環節，剛才我說過起碼有七、八點是我認為需要處理好的事情。在檢測、監督方面，我們看到疏漏，我們看到要強化；這些正正是我所講，調查一定是一問到底、問責到底、追究責任，改革整個制度。所以我們會繼續努力進行這方面的工作。

另外，犯法的人的手法會不斷改變。過去打擊罪案時，執法部門經常面對違法分子千方百計改變犯罪手法，所以跟違法分子鬥爭、克服調查所面對的挑戰，我們應該支持所有執法人員。他們勇於面對挑戰，不斷應付層出不窮、轉變新犯罪手法的團夥、罪犯，我們應該予以支持和鼓勵。

有關我將成立的委員會，其調查、報告一定會全面公開。

另外選舉方面，我已強調過，在我們的改革路上，我們會積極推動各方面的優化，系統改革會是全面的，我需要的改革夥伴，最重要的是立法會議員。盡快選出有能力、有抱負、有擔當的立法會議員，盡早履職，審核政府的方案、改革建議和撥款等，都必須要立法會議員全力盡快工作去幫助我們。我強調救援不會停、支援工作不會停、改革步伐亦不會停，所以盡快完成選舉，對我們的改革和支援，幫助災民之處，只會更集中、更多、更到位。

Labour Department highly concerned about fatal work accident that happened in Tuen Mun yesterday,2025-12-02 14:45,2025-12-02 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200434.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) is highly concerned about a fatal work accident that happened at a construction site in Tuen Mun yesterday afternoon (December 1), in which a male worker was suspected to have been struck by a hard object ejected from a moving excavator. He was certified dead later in hospital. The LD is saddened by the death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family.

  The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending the use of the excavator involved. The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

  The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take action pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

  To prevent workers from being struck by a hard object, the LD reminds owners of mobile appliances to regularly clean the crawlers of the appliances, thoroughly clear the hard objects from the roadway, and maintain a safe distance from workers while the appliances are moving.

  The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years on conviction on indictment; or $3 million and imprisonment for six months on summary conviction.

  In regard to yesterday's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

  The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

  For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."

Speech by SJ at 6th UNCITRAL Asia Pacific Judicial Summit 2025 - Judicial Roundtable (English only) (with photo),2025-12-02 13:25,2025-12-02 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200371.htm,"  Following are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the 6th UNCITRAL Asia Pacific Judicial Summit 2025 - Judicial Roundtable under Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 today (December 2):

Your Excellencies, distinguished judges and guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Today is the second day of the 6th UNCITRAL Asia Pacific Judicial Summit – the Judicial Roundtable, I wish to extend my special thanks to UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) for the organisation of the Roundtable and the Asian Development Bank for the Russian simultaneous interpretation so that judges from the Central Asia and other Russian-speaking jurisdictions would be able to participate in the roundtable discussions.

  The format of ""Roundtable"" is to facilitate knowledge sharing and open dialogue under an inclusive environment, which would enable participants to actively engage in the discussion. The theme of the Judicial Roundtable today is ""Recent Trends in Dispute Resolution"", with two sessions discussing firstly ""Judicial Handling of Disputes involving the Use of AI"" and second, ""Interactions between Alternative Dispute Resolution and Court Proceedings"". Let me share with you some of the recent initiatives in Hong Kong in this respect.

  Hong Kong has been widely recognised as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre for many years. In the 2025 International Arbitration Survey published by Queen Mary University of London, Hong Kong is ranked the second most preferred seat of arbitration globally, and is the most preferred arbitration seat in the Asia-Pacific region. To further strengthening Hong Kong's edges in international arbitration, the Department of Justice has newly set up a Working Group on Arbitration Law Reform to review and make recommendation to amend our Arbitration Ordinance.

  Apart from promotion of arbitration in general, we are promoting arbitration in specialised fields. For instance, it is one of the policy initiatives of the Chief Executive's Policy Address this year to establish a sports dispute resolution system and to promote sports mediation and arbitration, leveraging the institutional advantages of Hong Kong in dispute resolution. The Department of Justice established the Advisory Committee on Sports Dispute Resolution, and would launch a pilot scheme on sports dispute resolution for two years, providing a dedicated mechanism for resolving sports disputes through mediation and dispute resolution.

  When it comes to international mediation, the establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) provides a platform for settlement of international disputes, which includes disputes between a government and foreign nationals and also international commercial disputes through mediation. With its headquarter situated in Hong Kong, I am sure the establishment of IOMed will not only promote dispute resolution through mediation and other means, but also create synergies with other international organisations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions, which will further consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre.

  Lasty, I would like to mention the use of technology and artificial intelligence in Hong Kong. There is currently no bespoke legislation governing AI in Hong Kong. To harness the potential benefits this new technology may bring, it is incumbent upon the Hong Kong Government to take the lead to review the relevant law so as to provide a facilitative yet properly controlled legal environment for AI's development. As mentioned in this year's Chief Executive's Policy Address, the Department of Justice will form an interdepartmental working group to co-ordinate the responsible bureaux to review the legislation needed to complement the wider application of artificial intelligence.

  On this front, we are also promoting the use of lawtech in the Hong Kong legal and dispute resolution industry. Since the establishment of the Consultation Group on LawTech Development early this year, we progressively promote technology in the legal industry by adopting a three-stage approach, with the aim of enhancing the efficiency and quality of professional services through technology. These three stages include first, raising awareness of the legal profession and lawtech education for law students; second, engaging the legal profession with lawtech products through exhibitions and market surveys to enable firms to find suitable solutions for their business growth; and thirdly, encouraging the local and international lawtech enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong, in order to foster a vibrant lawtech ecosystem. We will also periodically review the legal framework to ensure it supports and regulates new legal technologies effectively.

  To conclude, I would like to thank the moderators, speakers of today's Judicial Roundtable, and all the participants, as well as UNCITRAL for their collaboration with the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy. The Academy was launched last year which is dedicated to conduct capacity building programmes in diverse areas of law for different stakeholders in the region and beyond. This Judicial Summit co-organised by UNCITRAL and the Academy has become a key platform for capacity building for judges coming from different parts of the world.

  On this note, I wish you all a very fruitful and enlightening roundtable discussion. For those who are leaving Hong Kong after the Roundtable, I wish you a safe journey home. For those joining us online, I am very keen on seeing you joining us in person in Hong Kong at the next UNCITRAL Asia Pacific Judicial Summit in 2027. Thank you very much."

Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case involving ocean-going vessel with goods worth about $195 million seized (with photos),2025-12-02 12:43,2025-12-02 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200282.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected a suspected smuggling case involving an ocean-going vessel on November 19. A large batch of suspected smuggled goods with an estimated market value of about $195 million was seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, Customs discovered that criminals intended to use an ocean-going vessel to smuggle goods, and thereby formulated enforcement actions. A suspicious container scheduled to depart from Hong Kong to Indonesia via an ocean-going vessel was selected for inspection.

Customs inspected the container that was scheduled to be shipped to Indonesia and declared as carrying tally counters and watches on that day. Upon examination, except for the tally counters and watches placed near the container doors, Customs officers found a large batch of suspected smuggled goods in the container, including LCD display panels, medical equipment, electronic products and vehicle parts.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Being a government department primarily responsible for tackling smuggling activities, Customs has long been combating various smuggling activities at the forefront. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on relevant crimes.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
​香港海關偵破一宗利用遠洋船走私一億九千萬五百萬元貨物案件（附圖）,2025-12-02 12:43,2025-12-02 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200281.htm,"香港海關十一月十九日偵破一宗涉嫌利用遠洋船走私的案件，並檢獲大批懷疑走私貨物，估計市值約一億九千萬五百萬元。

海關透過情報分析及風險評估，發現不法分子意圖利用遠洋船走私貨物，遂部署執法行動，鎖定一個原定由香港出發經遠洋船運往印尼的可疑貨櫃進行查驗。

海關當日檢查該個運往印尼、報稱載有計數器、手錶的貨櫃。經查驗後，除了放置於靠近貨櫃門的計數器及手錶，海關人員在該貨櫃內檢獲大批懷疑走私貨物，包括液晶顯示面板、醫療設備、電子產品及汽車零件等。

案件仍在調查中，不排除會有人被捕。

海關是專責打擊走私的政府部門，一直全方位積極打擊各類走私活動。海關的執法行動絕不鬆懈，將繼續嚴厲打擊海上走私活動，積極運用風險管理及情報主導執法策略，適時開展針對性的反走私行動，全力遏止相關罪行。

走私屬嚴重罪行，根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑走私活動。"
禁止「香港議會」及「香港民主建國聯盟」在香港運作,2025-12-02 12:14,2025-12-02 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200268.htm,"保安局局長已於今日（十二月二日）行使《維護國家安全條例》（2024年第6號）（《國安條例》）第60（1）條所賦予的權力，藉在憲報刊登命令，禁止「香港議會」及「香港民主建國聯盟」在香港特別行政區（香港特區）運作或繼續運作，即行生效。有關詳情列於2025年第174號號外公告（見附件）。

保安局發言人表示：「保安局局長在較早前已根據《國安條例》第60（4）條的規定，分別向該兩個組織發出書面通知，讓該兩個組織可在命令發出前提交申述，並在提交申述期限前收到『香港議會』的申述，但在提交申述期限前並無收到『香港民主建國聯盟』的申述。」

「保安局局長經小心考慮所有相關資料，包括『香港議會』提交的申述後，合理地相信禁止『香港議會』及『香港民主建國聯盟』在特區運作或繼續運作，是維護國家安全所需者，因此已根據《國安條例》第60（1）條的規定，在憲報刊登命令，禁止該兩個組織在香港特區運作或繼續運作。」

Dr Saia Piukala（世界衞生組織西太平洋區域主任蒲慕康醫生）、陳榕虎司長 （國家中醫藥管理局科技司司長）、邱亞洪局長（廣東省衞生健康委員會副主任、廣東省中醫藥局局長）、羅奕龍局長（澳門特別行政區（特區）政府衛生局局長）、各位專家朋友：

我謹代表香港特區政府感謝共同主辦第七屆粵港澳大灣區中醫藥傳承創新發展大會的廣東省中醫藥局，以及澳門特區政府衛生局，也感謝來自內地、澳門和海外的各位嘉賓、專家學者與各界代表蒞臨香港。

近日香港大埔火災造成重大傷亡，我對遇難者和殉職消防員表示哀悼，對家屬及受災人員表示慰問，並祝願傷者可早日康復。我更要向不懼危險日以繼夜、全力投入救援的前線消防、救護、警務和醫護人員致以最崇高的敬意。中央政府的關懷，全港以至全國社會各界和民眾的支持與捐助，體現出中華民族血濃於水、團結一心。

醫療衞生關乎人民生命健康與國家安全，面對重大突發災害，本港公營醫療體系承擔應急防治主體責任，而今次火災，私營醫療界別與不同醫療專業團體也主動提出響應。醫務衞生局正統籌各界力量，務求為傷者以至所有受災居民提供全面醫療保障。特區政府會全力支援受火災影響居民，與他們一同走過艱難的日子，撫平心靈創傷，重建家園。

國家主席習近平指出：「中醫藥是中華文明的瑰寶，傳承創新發展中醫藥是件大事，要把這一祖先留給我們的寶貴財富繼承好、發展好、利用好，推動中醫藥走向世界。」事實上，中醫藥已經成為香港醫療體系的重要組成部分，香港市民一向使用中醫藥服務，信賴中醫藥服務。粵港澳大灣區民心相通，傳承創新大會既是共同推動中醫藥高質量發展的平台，亦體現出三地醫療體系親如一家，並肩守護灣區居民的生命健康的使命。這次大會首次由香港特區政府承辦，正正反映香港在發展中醫藥方面大有可為，在助力國家推動中醫藥發展也可擔當重要角色。

本屆大會以「岐黃匯聚・灣區共創・國際綻放」為主題，旨在匯聚大灣區中醫藥界的智慧與力量，共同推進中醫藥傳承創新發展。大會也重視國際參與，提供平台讓來自世界各地的與會者互動交流，共商傳統醫藥的全球發展方向，為全人類的健康貢獻力量。

香港背靠祖國雄厚的中醫藥實力，同時擁有國際化的醫療體制、規管制度、標準制訂及臨床研究的優勢。中醫藥在香港醫療體系擔當重要角色，為市民健康提供保障，形成了中西醫協作互補的創新模式。在特區政府大力推動以及中醫藥業界支持下，今年是香港中醫藥發展的豐盛之年，隨着多項重要政策和措施相繼落實，香港中醫藥發展正邁向新里程。

首先，香港中醫醫院及政府中藥檢測中心兩個旗艦機構，將於下星期十二月十一日正式投入服務。兩大旗艦機構將為香港中醫藥發展開拓新機遇，並成為推動中醫藥服務發展、專業培訓、科研創新、標準制定及國際合作的引擎。香港中醫醫院將提供門診、日間和住院服務，以純中醫、中醫為主及中西醫協作的模式，全面開展中醫六大分科以及專病項目，重點發展中醫藥不同優勢領域。醫院將匯聚本地和海內外中醫藥精英，結合跨醫療專業團隊的協作，推動中醫藥以及中西醫協作服務的創新發展。我誠意邀請各位與兩大旗艦機構交流合作，共同助力中醫藥走向世界。

此外，我們在本月將公布《中醫藥發展藍圖》，內容涵蓋完善中醫藥服務體系、強化中醫專業發展、推動中藥界全面提升、普及中醫藥文化及助力中醫藥走向世界等範疇，為中醫藥發展訂立明確的方向，推動中醫及中藥全方位、高質量及高水平發展。

立足灣區、面向世界。粵港澳同根同源，優勢互補，香港會繼續與粵港澳大灣區其他城市同心協力，攜手推動中醫藥發展，同時積極發揮香港聯通世界的窗口作用，擔當助力中醫藥走向世界的橋頭堡，貢獻國家中醫藥的高質量發展。

最後，我祝願大會圓滿成功。謝謝大家。"

Government announces updates on Task Forces' follow-up work on Tai Po fire (with photos),2025-12-02 01:38,2025-12-02 01:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120100948.htm,"The Government continues to make full efforts in following up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. As of yesterday (December 1), the latest progress made by various bureaux and departments under the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fundraising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation - led respectively by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, and the Deputy Financial Secretary - was as follows:

Financial and welfare support
------------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po established by the Government, as of 1pm yesterday, the donations received have reached $1.3 billion. In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has reached around $1.6 billion. The fund will be used to assist the residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support. The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide the families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000 and $50,000 to cover funeral costs. The first batch of 18 cases was processed yesterday, and disbursement is underway. In addition, the Government also announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance of $50,000 to each affected household. The first batch of 20 cases for the living allowance of $50,000 was processed yesterday, and disbursement is also underway.

  The Government has been offering an emergency subsidy of $10,000 per affected household since the evening of November 27. As of 4pm yesterday, the Government has registered more than 1 900 households for the subsidy, with disbursement made to 1 861 households.

  In addition, the Government will provide four special subsidies, namely the injury grant, the student grant, the subsidy for workers and the subsidy for foreign domestic helpers. The amount of the injury grant ranges from $50,000 to $100,000, while that of the student grant, the subsidy for workers and the subsidy for foreign domestic helpers is at $20,000. 

  As of yesterday morning, social workers of the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with about 1 450 affected households, and more than 3 300 affected residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" support service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households for provision of all necessary assistance while fully back the support and relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.


Accommodation support
------------------------------

  As of yesterday morning, 945 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels/camps or hotel rooms. Another 1 470 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units of the Hong Kong Housing Society. Furthermore, two shelters remain open for residents in need.

  The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, went to CONCORDIA Sheung Yue River, a transitional housing project in Yuen Long, yesterday afternoon to visit and comfort victims affected by the fire. CONCORDIA Sheung Yue River has accommodated approximately 60 families, totalling over 100 fire victims. Mr Lee emphasised that the Government attaches high importance to the well-being of affected residents, focusing not only on immediate relief aid but also their various long-term living needs.

  During the visit, Mr Lee inquired about the residents' living conditions. Some victims stated that the $10,000 emergency cash subsidy quickly distributed by the Government after the fire, along with essential supplies such as bedding and household appliances co-ordinated by welfare organisations, have provided immediate relief and substantial support during their difficult time.

  Mr Lee also inspected the temporary supplies centre, converted from an activity room which keeps daily necessities donated by various sectors. He warmly praised the staff and social workers from the welfare organisation responsible for the operation, as well as the neighbourhood residents of CONCORDIA Sheung Yue River who voluntarily assisted the newly relocated victims. He noted their swift mobilisation at critical time to provide victims with comprehensive assistance, ranging from daily essentials to emotional support.

  Mr Lee said he is deeply moved by the selfless commitment of the welfare organisation personnel and CONCORDIA Sheung Yue River neighbourhood residents, believing they embody the spirit of mutual help and solidarity of the Hong Kong society.

  Meanwhile, the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, also visited residents affected by the fire at Pok Oi Kong Ha Wai Village, a transitional housing project at Kam Sheung Road in Yuen Long, yesterday afternoon to express sympathy and care for them, and to understand their living conditions and actual needs.

Relief supplies and donations
------------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform (www.taipodonation.hk) established by the Government and the information technology sector began operation on November 30 to facilitate registration of supplies donations from organisations and members of the public. Together with the information provided by members of the public via WhatsApp earlier, the Government has so far received over 470 registrations with different kinds of donation items including food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, beddings and electrical appliances. The Government will consolidate information of all donation items and distribute supplies to residents in need as necessary.

Medical services
----------------------

  To more comprehensively support the medical needs of the injured and residents affected by the fire, the Health Bureau made the following arrangements: (1) all injured individuals admitted to public hospitals under the Hospital Authority (HA) will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation; (2) all residents (including foreign domestic helpers) of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court will be eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31, 2026, covering various HA services; and (3) the Department of Health (DH) will also put in place similar fee waiver arrangements.

Replacements of identity documents
-------------------------------------------

  As at 4pm yesterday, the Immigration Department processed about 1 090 personal document replacement applications from the affected residents. Additionally, a total of 16 applications was processed for extension of stay and provision of services related to lost visa records from affected persons.

Transport services
----------------------

  Starting from yesterday, five taxi fleets will arrange some taxis to provide free special services for residents in need, mainly to and from various locations in Tai Po district. Details are provided under the dedicated website ""Support Services for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po"" set up by the Government (www.taipofire.gov.hk).

Handling of reported missing persons
----------------------------------------------

  The Police have completed searches at five buildings and deployed again more than 600 officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit to conduct searches at structurally-safe locations in the remaining two most affected buildings yesterday. As of 4pm yesterday, the Police handled eight sets of human remains in the buildings, including five sets of newly found and three sets found by firefighters but yet to be removed. The number of the deceased has been updated to 151. The Police will continue to follow up on the reported missing persons, aiming to confirm their status and the number of casualties as soon as possible.

  The forensic pathologists from the DH continued to assist personnel from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit on site in collecting evidence, making every effort to help identify the deceased. As of 4pm yesterday, the next of kin of 90 victims have completed necessary procedures at the Fu Shan Public Mortuary.

Investigations
-----------------

   In addition to the three personnel from a construction company who were arrested earlier, the Police have arrested another 10 individuals from various construction and engineering consultancy companies on suspicion of manslaughter. The Police have accorded top priority to the case and are gathering evidence through various channels for a thorough and in-depth investigation. The possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

Regulation and inspection work
----------------------------------------

  The Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau, together with more than 100 professionals from the Housing Department, completed on November 29 and 30 the inspections of more than 1 700 units in seven buildings, including Wang Yan House, Wang Tao House, Wang Kin House, Wang Tai House, Wang Shing House, Wang Chi House and Wang Sun House as well as a few floors of Wang Cheong House. The professionals yesterday have also completed the inspection of the remaining units in Wang Cheong House.

  According to the assessment of the professionals, the structure of some units may be subject to more serious damage, but there is no imminent danger in terms of the overall structural safety in all of the buildings inspected. With the full assistance of the officers from the Fire Services Department (FSD), the emergency maintenance contractors of the Housing Bureau have completed the relevant support works so that officers of the Police Force and the FSD can immediately enter the units for evidence collection and other operations. The ICU will conduct concrete core tests as soon as possible so that more detailed assessments on the conditions of the buildings can be made.

  The ICU has conducted on-site sampling at Wang Fuk Court and four other Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) courts that have been issued notices under the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme, including Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin, Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, and On Kay Court in Kwun Tong. Samples collected from different positions of the protective nets had been sent to the Government Laboratory for testing. The ICU will further arrange visits to these HOS courts to collect samples on site for Government Laboratory tests. Should any non-compliant elements be detected, the ICU will immediately request removal of the protective nets and refer the case to law enforcement agencies for prosecutions of the relevant maintenance contractors.

  The Buildings Department (BD) continued its special inspection operation. As of yesterday, the BD has inspected 359 buildings undergoing external wall maintenance. Among them, about 300 buildings were confirmed to have installed with scaffold nets, and samples have been taken. Test results are expected to be ready in batches within this week. Apart from the two buildings where plastic sheeting was found blocking the windows as announced earlier (being removed successively at the Government's instructions), no other buildings were found using foam boards or plastic sheeting to block windows.

  The Labour Department (LD) launched a territory-wide special enforcement operation since November 28, targeting the fire protection facilities and fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. This includes checking if protective screens (also known as scaffold nets) on scaffolds are in compliance with recognised standards for fire-retardant materials to safeguard occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm yesterday, the LD has inspected 61 construction sites, issued a total of 53 written warnings and 13 improvement notices, and has taken out two prosecutions."
