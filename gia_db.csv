勞工及福利局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-06-18 14:38,2025-06-18 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800490.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（六月十八日）出席王軍霞落戶香港分享會後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：見到失業率上升會否考慮暫停輸入外勞？另外政務司司長也提到現屆政府不採用貧窮線作指標，但若不用貧窮線，會否沒有客觀標準去評估政策成效？之後如何得知政府的政策是否有效？

勞工及福利局局長：我知道大家很關心有關輸入外勞的事，大家先看香港的整體狀況，現時面對的長期趨勢，一是人口老化，二是勞動人口到二○一八年已達頂峰，勞動人口一直慢慢向下跌，香港要有足夠勞動人口支撐經濟發展，所以我們推出補充勞工優化計劃，其實建基於香港的長遠形勢，推行時的大原則是確保本地工人優先就業，這是很重要的，所以大家看到優化計劃的每一宗申請也要先進行四個星期本地招聘，勞工處才會按實質需要決定是否批出配額。

昨天勞工處推出四項措施優化計劃，背後想法是希望可切切實實確保本地工人優先就業，這包括較早前已提過的投訴專線2150 6363，任何本地工人認為是因僱主聘請外勞而被解僱，請作具名投訴，我們一定從嚴處理，如屬實會對僱主作出行政制裁。另外，僱主遞交優化計劃申請後，其後六個月內提交的其他申請一般不獲處理，因為過往紀錄有約四分之一的申請是在六個月之內重複申請，最多的個案有六次，我們認為這不太妥當，希望做得更妥善。此外亦會加強巡查，若僱主使用勞工處互動就業服務網站進行四星期本地招聘，刊登職位空缺資料時會展示僱主的名稱。以上均是要致力保障本地工人優先就業。

另一點大家也關注的是精準扶貧。我們已多次提出利用貧窮線只能作相對量度，相對一個中位數看你的收入如何，就如只看體重指數（BMI）來決定一個人是否健康，而不看其他的身體徵狀，是不太適宜的，所以我們認為香港做扶貧工作要更加精準，接下來會公布有關精準扶貧的整份報告，詳細臚列我們怎樣做好扶貧、防貧、脫貧。

香港政府在社福、教育、醫療這三大範疇的開支每年超過三千多億元，佔一般經常賬支出超過六成，香港長期對於以上三大範疇，對於扶貧、抗貧、脫貧等極關重要的項目提供大量的政府公帑資助，大家都要明白我們在這方面做很多工夫。

記者：首先想了解人才計劃，較早前指年中會公布續簽情況，大概何時會公布已處理多少宗續簽和反應，當中有否發現到有個案可能提交的資料有造假的情況？第二方面想跟進關於補充勞工優化計劃，有公司在勞工處網頁聲稱聘請售貨員但實質是請魚檔工人，這類情況會怎樣跟進處理，以及為何改善措施中沒有要求僱主刊登名稱或者聯絡方式?

勞工及福利局局長：大家都很關注人才續簽的事，尤其是高端人才通行證計劃（高才通），較早前我已作解釋，高才通第一批獲得簽證人士是二○二二年年底開始，大多數是二○二三年期間取得，我們統計從今年年中開始約有一萬宗的高才的申請到期要續簽，所以要等數目較大時再作公布會較合適，這需要多些時間，現時只是六月，到年中左右才會看到多些數目，或許到今年稍後時間或我們掌握較具體和有代表性的情況時，一定會跟大家交代分析。

第二我也有留意到有報道指勞工處網頁中聲稱和實質聘請的職位不同，我們要查證清楚，究竟這是否屬實，如屬實當然會追究相關僱主，如非實情我想提醒大家要確保說法符合事實。在翻查紀錄後得知真實狀況後，一定盡量向大家公布。但大家可以放心，我們要確確實實做到本地工人優先就業，其實每一次的四星期的招聘我們亦有提醒工會的代表，每一次都希望工會代表幫忙提醒工友有招聘機會，如合適可以去面試應徵，這是我們很認真去做的。

現在我們再進一步改善措施，就是僱主在進行四星期本地招聘時，在勞工處的招聘網站要清楚指出這次招聘目的是準備打算申請外勞配額，如大家認為工作適合自己就要積極參與，當聘請了本地工人便不會再額外聘請外勞，這是必須要清楚說明的，在整個流程中要做到公平公允，一是盡可能將工作留給本地工人，這是我們最大的意願。但另一方面如實在沒有本地人願意做，亦要給僱主一個途徑，聘請外勞以填補勞動力的缺口，我希望將這事講得清楚。就剛才提及的具體個案，我已立即請勞工處跟進作深入調查，很快會跟公布事實到底如何。勞工處互動就業服務網站其實一視同仁，網站有數以萬計的工種會作同一安排。

記者：首先想跟進今次王軍霞女士和女兒來港，特區政府扮演的角色是主動邀請還是協助處理申請？局長希望王君霞女士和她女兒成為香港人之後具體對香港有甚麼貢獻？

勞工及福利局局長：我理解是王軍霞女士是通過我們的計劃提出申請的，我知道尚海龍扮演了穿針引線的角色，這是很好的，很多時候世界上優秀的人才都關注香港，但正式通過計劃申請的話，通常是有中間人提出不如考慮香港，香港一定是具有吸引力，王女士才會考慮通過優秀人才計劃成為我們的一部分。

我個人期望王女士第一件事會幫忙做好的，是向全世界說好香港故事，因為她會到世界很多不同地方，我相信她肯定做得到，通過她這麼重要的身分，她說的話很多人會報道，而且她親身體驗香港後關於香港的評論，一定可以更好地說好香港故事。當然中長期我也很希望王女士可以為香港的體育事業或經濟發展貢獻她一分力量，我相信她一定可以做得到。"
立法會十六題：非商業團體開立銀行帳戶,2025-06-18 14:32,2025-06-18 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800210.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上陳恒鑌議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的書面答覆：

問題：

本人接獲多宗涉及非商業團體開立銀行帳戶的求助個案，當中部分「三無大廈」在成立業主立案法團（法團）後六至八個月仍無法開立銀行帳戶，導致法團無法集資運作，反觀商業機構開立帳戶平均需時僅一至二個月。有意見認為，法團開戶困難的問題已嚴重影響基層民生，與政府改善社區的目標背道而馳。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，過去三年，香港金融管理局（金管局）共收到多少宗關於非商業團體開立銀行帳戶時遇到困難（例如處理時間過長）的投訴；

（二）是否知悉，金管局有否措施簡化銀行在審批非商業團體開立帳戶（尤其是法團等社會服務類的帳戶）申請時的要求，以縮短處理時間；

（三）會否修訂《銀行業條例》（第155章）或發牌指引，明文要求銀行為社會服務機構提供便捷的開戶程序；及

（四）是否知悉，金管局會否設立指標，以加強銀行在處理法團等機構開戶申請時的積極性，或對屢遭投訴的銀行施加罰則？

答覆：

主席：

為保障銀行系統的穩健及客戶利益，銀行在與客戶建立業務關係時，均須遵守相關的法律及監管規定。不論開戶申請人是商業機構或非商業團體（包括業主立案法團（法團）），銀行為其開立帳戶前，均須對申請人進行盡職審查。

香港金融管理局（金管局）一直密切留意有關非商業團體在香港開立銀行帳戶的情況。就此，金管局不時提醒銀行業界在執行穩健管控措施的同時，也應避免對正當企業及機構（包括法團及其他非商業團體）在獲得銀行服務時造成不合理的障礙。銀行在客戶盡職審查過程中應與客戶保持良好溝通，以具透明度、合理和高效的程序妥善處理客戶的開戶申請，貫徹公平待客的原則，並且在適當的情況下靈活和務實地處理開戶申請。

就問題的四個部分，經諮詢金管局後，現回覆如下：

針對企業及機構開立銀行戶口方面，金管局已於二○二三年四月向銀行發出通函，進一步闡明相關的客戶盡職審查要求，當中亦就客戶溝通、理解市場發展及風險管控方面提供指引，並分享以往個案和良好做法供業界參考，以協助銀行在開戶方面達致有效成果和提升客戶體驗。金管局亦已要求銀行檢視其開戶程序、客戶盡職審查措施，以及提供員工培訓。

因應金管局的指引，銀行於近年推出了多項有助改善客戶辦理開戶手續的措施，涵蓋法團及其他非商業團體，包括向申請人提供開戶申請的最新進展、設立覆核機制、按客戶要求重新審視開戶申請等。金管局也透過設立專用電郵及熱線電話，收集來自公眾及相關持份者的查詢，並由金管局內的開立及維持戶口專責小組（專責小組）處理和跟進。

至於有關法團的開戶程序，法團作為根據《建築物管理條例》（第344章）成立的獨立法人組織，銀行會採納適用於與法人相關的盡職審查程序，包括要求申請人提供法團註冊的相關文件、通過開立銀行戶口及委任授權簽字人決議的管理委員會會議或法團業主大會的會議紀錄或摘錄，以及授權簽字人的身分證明文件。銀行亦會因應實際情況和風險評估需要，要求申請人提交其他資料和文件。至於開戶所需時間，則視乎個別個案的情況及申請人是否已提交所需要的資料而定。據金管局向多間主要銀行了解，銀行在收齊申請人提交所需要的資料及文件後，一般可在約兩星期內完成相關開戶手續。

金管局一直與民政事務總署（民政總署）保持緊密聯繫，並按溝通及轉介機制為有需要的法團在開立銀行戶口方面提供協助。二○二五年五月，金管局與民政總署共同與銀行業界代表會面，就法團開立銀行戶口的事宜作直接交流，包括討論有關業主成立法團後，辦理開立銀行戶口的情況。與會銀行均反應正面，亦已積極推出相關便利措施協助法團，其中包括於其銀行網頁刊載開立法團戶口的資訊；提供開戶熱線電話及銀行的聯絡方法，以方便法團就開立銀行戶口事宜向個別銀行作出查詢；由專責同事處理法團開戶查詢及申請；以及提供多個渠道及預約安排協助法團開戶。為進一步提升資訊透明度及縮短開戶所需時間，金管局、民政總署及銀行業界正合作編製開戶相關的實用資訊，讓法團更清楚了解開戶要求及預早準備開戶所需文件，以提升客戶體驗。

就金管局和上述專責小組在過去三年收到有關非商業團體就銀行處理開戶申請的投訴和求助個案數字，現表列如下：





二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年
二○二五年
			（截至五月底）


金管局收到的投訴
沒有
一宗（註一）
沒有
一宗（註二）


專責小組收到的求助個案
兩宗（註三）
兩宗（註四）
沒有

註一：銀行已妥善處理有關投訴，而投訴人與銀行溝通後沒有再尋求金管局協助。
註二：銀行正按金管局要求作出跟進。
註三：兩宗涉及法團的個案均已獲解決。
註四：分別涉及一宗法團個案及一宗其他非商業團體個案，均已獲解決。

除上述的個案外，金管局亦不時收到由民政總署及地區組織轉介的查詢，主要涉及新成立法團就開立銀行戶口的程序及要求。為此，金管局已向相關新成立法團提供適切協助，而相關新成立法團亦陸續向銀行提交開戶申請。金管局了解部分個案在法團向銀行提供所需的資料後，平均約在兩星期內成功開立銀行戶口。當中亦有個案可於一星期內完成開戶。

金管局及銀行業界已採取一系列措施，在符合相關法例及監管規定的前提下，便利各類企業和機構開立銀行戶口。我們認為目前無須就開戶事宜修訂法例或設定硬性指標。金管局會繼續就開立銀行戶口事宜與銀行業界及相關持份者保持緊密溝通和合作，確保銀行理順相關開戶流程，以提升客戶體驗。"
LCQ16: Opening of bank accounts by non-commercial organisations,2025-06-18 14:32,2025-06-18 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800211.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Chan Han-pan and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 I have received a number of requests for assistance involving the opening of bank accounts by non-commercial organisations and, among them, some ""three-nil buildings"" are still unable to open bank accounts six to eight months after the formation of owners' corporations (OCs), rendering the OCs unable to raise funds for their operation. On the contrary, it takes only one to two months on average for commercial organisations to open accounts. There are views that the difficulties encountered by OCs in opening accounts have seriously affected the livelihood of the grass roots and run counter to the Government's objective of improving the community. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the total number of complaints received by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in the past three years about non-commercial organisations encountering difficulties (e.g. excessively long processing time) in opening bank accounts;

(2) whether it knows if HKMA has put in place measures to streamline the requirements for banks in vetting and approving applications from non-commercial organisations for opening accounts (in particular social service accounts such as those for OCs), so as to shorten the processing time;

(3) whether it will amend the Banking Ordinance (Cap. 155) or the licensing guidelines to expressly require banks to provide social service organisations with convenient procedures for opening accounts; and

(4) whether it knows if HKMA will set indicators to increase banks' incentive to process applications from organisations such as OCs for opening accounts, or impose penalties on banks against which complaints have been repeatedly lodged?

Reply:

President,

 To safeguard the stability of the banking system and customer interests, banks are required to comply with the relevant laws and regulatory requirements when establishing business relationship with customers. Banks are required to conduct customer due diligence (CDD) on applicants seeking to open a bank account irrespective of whether they are commercial entities or non-commercial entities (including Owners' Corporations (OCs)).

 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been closely monitoring the situation regarding bank account opening of non-commercial entities in Hong Kong. In this connection, the HKMA reminds the banking sector from time to time that while implementing robust control measures, they should also avoid creating unreasonable barriers for legitimate businesses and entities (including OCs and other non-commercial entities) to access banking services. Banks should maintain proper communication with customers throughout the CDD process, properly handle customers' account opening applications through transparent, reasonable and efficient procedures, uphold the principle of treating customers fairly, and where appropriate flexibly and pragmatically handle account opening applications.

 After consulting the HKMA, our reply to the four parts of the question is as follows:

 The HKMA issued a circular to banks in April 2023 to provide further guidance on the CDD requirements with respect to account opening for commercial entities or non-commercial entities. The circular also sets out guidance on communication with customers, understanding of market developments and risk management, as well as shares past cases and good practices for the industry's reference, so as to assist banks in achieving effective outcomes and enhancing customer experience in account opening. The HKMA has also required banks to review their account opening procedures and CDD measures, and provide staff training.

 In response to the HKMA's guidance, banks have introduced various facilitation measures in recent years to improve the account opening process for customers, covering OCs and other non-commercial entities. These measures include providing applicants with updates on the progress of their account opening applications, establishing review mechanisms and re-examining account opening applications upon customers' request. The HKMA has also set up a dedicated email and hotline to collect enquiries from the public and relevant stakeholders, which are handled and followed up by a dedicated team within the HKMA for account opening and maintenance (the dedicated team).

 Regarding the account opening application process for OCs, as an OC is an independent body corporate set up under the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344), banks would adopt CDD measures applicable to a legal person. These include requiring applicants to provide relevant registration documents of the corporation, minutes or extracts of resolutions of the management committee meeting or general meeting of the OC regarding the approval for opening a bank account and appointment of authorised signatories, as well as the identification documents of the appointed authorised signatories. Banks may also request additional information or documents from the applicants having regard to the specific circumstances and their risk assessments. The turnaround time for account opening depends on the circumstances of individual cases, as well as whether the applicant has furnished the required information. As the HKMA understood from major banks, the account opening process could generally be completed in around two weeks upon receipt of the required information and documents from applicants.

 The HKMA has been maintaining close communication with the Home Affairs Department (HAD) and offering support to the OCs seeking assistance on bank account opening under the established communication and referral mechanism. In May 2025, the HKMA and the HAD held a meeting with representatives from the banking sector for a direct exchange on matters relating to bank account opening for OCs, including a discussion on the bank account opening situations following the establishment of OCs. The participating banks responded positively and have actively introduced facilitation measures to assist OCs, including publishing information in relation to bank account opening for OCs on banks' websites; providing hotlines and contact information for OCs to enquire about account opening related information with individual banks; assigning designated staff to handle enquiries and applications in relation to bank account opening for OCs; as well as offering multiple channels and appointment arrangements to facilitate account opening for OCs. To further enhance transparency and shorten the account opening turnaround time, the HKMA, the HAD and the banking sector are jointly compiling practical information related to bank account opening, so as to assist OCs to better understand the account opening requirements and make advance preparation for the necessary documentations, with a view to enhancing customer experience.

 The numbers of complaints and requests for assistance received by the HKMA and the aforementioned dedicated team over the past three years regarding banks' handling of account opening applications by non-commercial entities are tabulated as follows:





2022
2023
2024
2025
			(as of end-May)


Complaint received by the HKMA
None
1 case
			(Note 1)
None
1 case
			(Note 2)


Request for assistance received by the dedicated team
2 cases
			(Note 3)
2 cases
			(Note 4)
None
None



Note 1: The bank concerned properly handled the complaint, and the complainant did not seek further assistance from the HKMA after communicating with the bank.
Note 2: The bank is following up on the case as requested by the HKMA.
Note 3: Two cases concerning OCs have been resolved.
Note 4: These involved one case concerning an OC and one case concerning other non-commercial entity, both of which have been resolved.

 Apart from the above cases, the HKMA also received cases referred by the HAD and district organisations from time to time, mainly concerning the bank account opening procedures and requirements for newly formed OCs. In this connection, the HKMA has provided appropriate assistance to these newly formed OCs, and these OCs have subsequently started to proceed with their bank account opening applications. The HKMA noted that for some of these cases, bank accounts were successfully opened within about two weeks on average after the OCs provided the required information to banks. In certain cases, bank accounts were opened within one week.

 The HKMA and the banking sector have implemented a series of measures to facilitate bank account opening for various businesses and entities, while ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulatory requirements. We consider that there is currently no need to introduce legislative amendments or set fixed targets regarding account opening matters. The HKMA will continue to maintain close communication and collaboration with the banking sector and relevant stakeholders on bank account opening matters, with a view to streamlining the related account opening processes and enhancing customer experience."

Transport Department approves route expansion for autonomous vehicles pilot licence trials in North Lantau,2025-06-18 14:00,2025-06-18 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800276.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (June 18) that a pilot licence for autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been updated in accordance with section 20(3)(b) of the Road Traffic (Autonomous Vehicles) Regulation (Cap. 374AA) to expand the routes for AV trials in North Lantau.

  The applicant has been approved to conduct trials for 10 AVs during a specified time on specified road sections in Tung Chung. Three autonomous private cars can be operated in each road test at most. The specified expanded routes cover Man Tung Road, Ying Hei Road, Yi Tung Road, Tung Chung Eastern Interchange, Yu Tung Road, Chung Yan Road, Shun Tung Road, Tung Chung Waterfront Road and Wai Tung Road.

  A spokesman for the TD said that the North Lantau project, which commenced in December 2024, has made significant progress to date. The TD has expedited ongoing monitoring, proactively taken forward the project and granted approval under the new AV regulatory framework, achieving several technical advancements within months. They included scaling up the trials from a single vehicle to 10 vehicles operating simultaneously to collect multi-vehicle data, conducting designated passenger-carrying trials on specific routes after safety assessment, expanding the trial scope to roads with more complex traffic scenarios, and increasing the maximum speed limit to 50 km/h based on the trial route. This updated pilot licence further expands the trial routes, so that more useful data can be collected to evaluate AV performance in more different road conditions and communities.

  The TD's label for pilot AV shall be displayed on all pilot AVs for identification by other road users. Details of the pilot licence have been uploaded to the TD's website on AV trials.

  The TD welcomes interested organisations or enterprises to submit applications for a pilot licence and act in concert to promote the further development of autonomous driving in Hong Kong. Upon receipt of an application, the TD will consider various factors, including the design operating range and functions of the autonomous system submitted by the applicant, relevant international or national standards/guidelines, and the road test situations, based on the Code of Practice for Trial and Pilot Use of Autonomous Vehicles before approval. The TD will exercise stringent control with a view to promoting AV trials and development in Hong Kong in a safe and orderly manner."

立法會四題：推動跨境生態旅遊,2025-06-18 13:18,2025-06-18 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800366.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上李梓敬議員的提問和署理文化體育及旅遊局局長劉震的答覆：

問題：

據報，深圳大鵬半島毗鄰香港印洲塘，具豐富的生態資源，而近年深圳及香港均有意加強生態旅遊及海洋保育上的合作。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時特區政府與深圳大鵬新區相關政府部門，在生態旅遊、綠色經濟及海洋保育等方面已展開的合作項目，以及達成的合作協議的詳情為何；有否統計，過去五年，該等合作項目的具體數據及成效；

（二）有否計劃推動吉澳、東平洲至大鵬半島的跨境生態旅遊及規劃相關海上航線，包括在該等地區興建「一地兩檢」碼頭；若有，現時與深圳當局磋商的詳情和進度為何，包括技術上的可行性、預計時間表及相關配套設施等；若否，原因為何；及

（三）針對上述跨境生態旅遊航線，政府有否評估其對本港旅遊業及地區經濟的預期效益，以及在環境保育上的潛在風險為何；如有，評估結果，以及因應有關結果所制訂的政策方向為何？

答覆：

主席：

根據二○二三年公布的《北部都會區行動綱領》，位於北部都會區最東部的「藍綠康樂旅遊生態圈」由紅花嶺、蓮麻坑、沙頭角、印洲塘及沿海村落和外島等組成。區內藍綠資源豐富，包括郊野公園、海岸公園和地質公園等，並擁有很多傳統鄉鎮，具有潛力作康樂及旅遊發展。

文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）在《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》下提出推動香港獨特的世界級頂尖資源與旅遊的深度結合，打造特色鮮明、吸引力強的旅遊產品與項目，「生態＋旅遊」是其中一個推動方向。在尊重生態及保護環境的前提下，適度向訪客展現香港擁有的珍貴生態資源，同時盡量減低過多訪客可能對環境帶來的潛在影響，平衡保育和發展的需要。

環境及生態局轄下的漁農自然護理署（漁護署）把香港印洲塘具高生態價值地方劃為郊野公園、海岸公園和地質公園，以作保育及生態教育及康樂用途。

上述工作亦需顧及一些當地社區希望保持鄉郊寧靜環境的意見。

就李梓敬議員的提問，經諮詢環境及生態局、發展局、保安局及運輸及物流局後，現回覆如下︰

（一）特區政府與深圳當局在個別領域設立機制保持緊密合作。在生態保育及環境保護方面，隨着紅花嶺郊野公園去年成立，漁護署與深圳市規劃和自然資源局去年簽訂合作協議，推動建設深圳梧桐山和香港紅花嶺的生態廊道，包括聯合清除外來物種、進行生態調查、研究優化動物通道和加強宣傳教育。香港聯合國教科文組織世界地質公園亦與深圳大鵬半島國家地質自然公園合作於去年及今年在兩地舉行科普講座及展覽，提升兩地市民對深港地質歷史、地貌及地質公園的認識。

在海洋保育方面，環境保護署與深圳市生態環境局透過「大鵬灣及后海灣（深圳灣）區域環境管理專題小組」，完善污水收集和處理。經兩地的努力，大鵬灣的水質維持良好，對於保育海洋生態，特別是分布在香港東北水域的石珊瑚起了非常重要作用。

文體旅局與深圳當局一直按互利共贏的原則就旅遊領域加強合作，包括在平衡生態保育及旅遊發展的前提下，鼓勵業界設計有關生態旅遊的產品和路線。兩地旅遊業界也會安排相關的「踩線團」，以協助推廣工作。

（二）及（三）香港東北印州塘一帶擁有獨特的地質景觀、豐富的生態環境，以及歷史悠久的村落文化。漁護署與持份者及社區合作在該處設立了訪客中心、文化徑、陸路遊覽路線、跳島遊行程及海上遊覽路線等，為訪客帶來深度的綠色旅遊體驗。此外，環境及生態局轄下的鄉郊保育辦公室致力推動活化村落，並在二○二五年一月至二月在沙頭角谷埔舉辦「鄉郊豐年節：谷埔『聲─色─味』之旅」活動，結合當地的自然生態、歷史建築和鄉郊文化，讓大眾感受香港鄉郊的獨特魅力。

文體旅局透過在粵港、港深合作機制下成立的「對接北部都會區發展策略專班」下的「沙頭角合作區工作小組」，以「低密度、高質量」和深化歷史文化元素的原則，與深方推進沙頭角及附近地方（包括吉澳）的旅遊發展。文體旅局亦一直鼓勵業界開發多元化的特色旅遊產品。現時內地遊客可以便捷地經各出入境口岸入境香港參加本地行程，包括香港境內的生態旅遊路線。早前，我們聯同香港旅遊業議會積極為香港與深圳兩地業界穿針引綫，例如在去年十二月為深圳鹽田區旅遊業界舉辦沙頭角跳島「踩線團」，到訪荔枝窩、吉澳和鴨洲等景點，設計從蓮塘／香園圍口岸入境後的沙頭角跳島團。

至於問題第二部分所提及的興建一地兩檢碼頭以發展深圳東部水域與香港北部都會區的跨境航線，的確會如問題第三部分所述，牽涉眾多複雜考量，包括有關航線的長遠市場需求和區域的承載力；需要提供的基建配套，伴隨的規劃改動、以致基建投資的經濟及成本效益；需要面對的安保挑戰；以及可能對生態環境帶來的潛在影響等，需要兩地政府從長計議。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Promoting cross-boundary eco-tourism,2025-06-18 13:18,2025-06-18 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800367.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Dominic Lee and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

It has been reported that the Dapeng Peninsula of Shenzhen, which is adjacent to Yan Chau Tong of Hong Kong, possesses rich ecological resources, and both Shenzhen and Hong Kong have expressed intentions in recent years to strengthen cooperation in eco-tourism and marine conservation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the details of cooperation projects commenced and co-operation agreements reached between the SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government and the relevant government departments of Dapeng New District, Shenzhen in terms of, among others, eco-tourism, green economy, and marine conservation; whether it has compiled statistics on the specific data and effectiveness of such co-operation projects over the past five years;

(2) whether it has plans to promote cross-boundary eco-tourism from Kat O and Tung Ping Chau to the Dapeng Peninsula and devise related sea routes, including the construction of piers for ""co-location arrangement"" in such areas; if so, of the details and progress of the ongoing negotiations with Shenzhen authorities, including technical feasibility, estimated timetable, and related ancillary facilities; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the Government has assessed the expected benefits of the aforementioned cross-boundary eco-tourism routes for Hong Kong's tourism industry and local economy, as well as the potential risks involved in environmental conservation; if so, of the assessment results, and the policy directions determined in response to such results?

Reply:

President,

According to the Northern Metropolis (NM) Action Agenda announced in 2023, the Blue and Green Recreation, Tourism and Conservation Circle situated in the easternmost part of the NM comprises Robin's Nest, Lin Ma Hang, Sha Tau Kok, Yan Chau Tong as well as coastal villages and the outlying islands. With abundant blue and green resources including country parks, marine parks and geopark as well as a number of traditional rural townships, this zone has the potential for recreation and tourism development.

As set out in the Development Blueprint for Hong Kong's Tourism Industry 2.0, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) promotes in-depth integration of Hong Kong's unique world-class resources with tourism, and crafts tourism products and projects with distinctive features and strong appeal, with ""Ecology+Tourism"" being one of the development strategies. On the premises of respecting the nature and protecting the environment, we will appropriately unveil Hong Kong's precious ecological resources to visitors, and at the same time minimise the potential environmental impact due to too many visitors as far as practicable, thereby balancing the needs for conservation and tourism development.

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) under the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) has designated places of high ecological value in Yan Chau Tong as country park, marine park and geopark, for conservation and eco-education and recreation purposes.

In taking forth the above work, the wish of some local communities for maintaining a quiet countryside environment should also be considered.

Having consulted the EEB, the Development Bureau, the Security Bureau and the Transport and Logistics Bureau, a consolidated reply in response to the questions raised by the Hon Dominic Lee is as follows:

(1) The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has established mechanisms with the Shenzhen authorities for the cooperation in individual areas. On ecological conservation and environmental protection, following the establishment of the Robin's Nest Country Park last year, the AFCD and the Planning and Natural Resources Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality signed the Cooperation Agreement last year on the establishment of the ecological corridor between Shenzhen Wutong Mountain and Hong Kong Robin's Nest, including jointly removing invasive species, conducting ecological surveys, examining enhancement of animal corridors and enhancing publicity and education. The Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark also collaborated with the Shenzhen Dapeng Peninsula National Geological Natural Park to hold science lectures and exhibitions in both locations last year and this year, enabling citizens of both sides to have better understanding of the geological history, landforms, and geoparks of the two places.

On marine conservation, the Environmental Protection Department and the Ecology and Environment Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality have been improving sewage collection and treatment through the Mirs Bay and Deep Bay (Shenzhen Bay) Areas Environmental Management Special Panel. With the concerted efforts of both sides, the water quality of Mirs Bay has been kept at a good level, and it is conducive to the conservation of marine ecology, especially the hard corals in the northeast waters of Hong Kong.

The CSTB has been strengthening co-operation with the Shenzhen authorities in the tourism aspect under the principle of mutual benefits, including encouraging the trade to design eco-tourism products and itineraries on the premise of striking a balance between ecological conservation and tourism development. The travel trade of the Shenzhen and Hong Kong will also organise relevant familiarisation visits to help with the promotion work.

(2) and (3) Yan Chau Tong in the northeastern part of Hong Kong possesses unique geological landscape, rich ecology and village culture with long history. The AFCD has, in collaboration with stakeholders and the local community, established visitor centers, cultural trails, land tour routes, island-hopping itineraries, and maritime tour routes, providing tourists an in-depth green tour experience. In addition, the Countryside Conservation Office under the EEB is dedicated to revitalising villages, and held the Countryside Harvest Festival: Kuk Po 'Sound, Sight, Taste Fusion' Tour at Kuk Po in Sha Tau Kok from January to February 2025. The event blended local natural ecology, historical architecture and countryside culture, allowing the public to experience the unique charm of Hong Kong's countryside.

Through the Working Group for Sha Tau Kok Co-operation Zone set up under the Task Force for Collaboration on the Northern Metropolis Development Strategy under the Guangdong-Hong Kong and Hong Kong-Shenzhen co-operation mechanism, the CSTB collaborates with Shenzhen to promote the tourism development in Sha Tau Kok and nearby areas (including Kat O) under the overall principle of ""low density, high quality"" and through enriching its historical and cultural elements. The CSTB has also been encouraging the business sector to develop diversified tourism products. At present, Mainland visitors can conveniently enter Hong Kong through various boundary control points to join local tours, including eco-tourism itineraries in Hong Kong. Earlier on, in collaboration with the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, the CSTB actively engaged with the trade in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. For instance, the CSTB organised the Sha Tau Kok island-hopping familiarisation tour for the travel trade from Yantian District of Shenzhen in December last year, which included visits to Lai Chi Wo, Kat O and Ap Chau, etc, for designing Sha Tau Kok island-hopping tours after crossing the boundary from the Liantang/Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point.

As regards the construction of piers for ""co-location arrangement"" for developing cross-boundary ferry routes between the eastern waters of Shenzhen and the NM area of Hong Kong as mentioned in part two of the question, it will indeed involve a number of complex considerations as mentioned in part three of the question, including the long-term market demand for the ferry routes concerned and the carrying capacity of the region; the infrastructure facilities that are required, the consequential change of planning as well as the economic and cost-effectiveness of the infrastructure investment; the security challenges that will have to be faced; and the potential impacts on the ecological environment, etc. which require long-term consideration by both sides of the governments.

Thank you President."
立法會六題：保障本地勞工優先就業,2025-06-18 13:00,2025-06-18 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800270.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上陳克勤議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃）至今的批准輸入勞工人數超過五萬人。另一方面，政府最新公布的失業率為百分之三點四，是27個月以來高位。關於保障本地勞工優先就業，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於據報，有優化計劃申請企業在進行本地招聘時，設定不合理條件以排除本地應徵者，過去三年，涉及本地招聘程序違規的投訴或舉報，以及當中查明屬實的個案數目及有關處罰為何；有何機制主動核查該等招聘條件的合理性；

（二）鑑於據報，在優化計劃要求企業的外勞對本地勞工比例不得低於一比二的情況下，有企業以兼職方式聘請本地員工，或安排外勞擔任與申請不一致的崗位，政府有否了解有關情況；及

（三）過去三年，被拘捕的非法勞工人數為何，並按從事行業列出分項數字；有否評估，現行對非法勞工僱主及有關中介機構的處罰措施是否具足夠阻嚇力？

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，政府已加強輸入勞工的機制。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

就議員的提問，經諮詢保安局，現答覆如下：

（一）勞工處一直嚴謹處理每宗優化計劃的申請。僱主必須先進行四星期本地招聘，優先聘請合適的本地工人填補空缺。勞工處會審視及確認僱主在本地招聘期間所有職位空缺的聘用條件，包括入職和學歷要求、每月薪酬及工作時數。僱主在本地招聘期間經任何途徑聘用本地求職者，均不得提供遜於勞工處同意的聘用條件。

僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果並遞交招聘廣告作核對。勞工處會聯繫每名不獲僱主聘用的本地求職者，評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會施加行政制裁，中止處理有關僱主提交的輸入勞工申請，並拒絕處理僱主在隨後一年提交的其他申請。自推行優化計劃以來，勞工處沒有發現僱主違反本地招聘的規定或接獲求職者的相關投訴。

（二）為保障本地工人的就業機會，優化計劃規定有關僱主須持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例的規定，即二比一。全職僱員是指僱主直接僱用而每周總工作時數不少於35小時以經營相關業務的本地僱員，不包括兼職僱員、向僱主提供服務的外判商員工或自僱人士。同時，僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。為確保僱主不會在聘請輸入勞工後解僱本地工人，勞工處已設立投訴專線，電話號碼是2150 6363。我呼籲僱員如懷疑因僱主聘用輸入勞工而遭解僱，請致電熱線，勞工處會嚴肅跟進。如情況屬實，勞工處會對有關僱主作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准，以及拒絕處理僱主在隨後兩年提交的其他申請。

此外，優化計劃的輸入勞工必須按照政府訂定的標準僱傭合約（標準合約）條款受聘，並按標準合約所訂，在指定的工作地點擔任指定的職位及執行指定的職務。

勞工處的勞工督察不時巡查優化計劃下輸入勞工的工作地點，查核僱主有否遵守《僱傭條例》和優化計劃的規定，並要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例。僱主如違反相關規定，包括不符合人手比例的規定、安排輸入勞工擔任標準合約訂明以外的職務，勞工處會對僱主作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准，以及拒絕處理僱主在隨後最多兩年提交的其他申請。

（三）從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，僱主和非法勞工及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。《入境條例》載有不同條文，針對不同人士的相關犯罪行為。訪客、非法入境者及逾期逗留人士等均不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。協助及教唆者同罪。此外，政府於二○二一年修訂《入境條例》，增加對僱主僱用非法勞工的刑罰，最高刑罰由原來的罰款35萬元和監禁三年大幅提高至罰款50萬元和監禁10年，反映有關罪行的嚴重性。另外，任何人違反逗留條件從事任何有薪或無薪僱傭工作，即屬犯罪，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。此外，如有本港的職業介紹所或其有關連人士因違反《入境條例》被定罪，勞工處可考慮撤銷或拒絕續發有關職業介紹所的牌照。如該些人士日後申請經辦其他職業介紹所，勞工處亦會考慮拒絕發出牌照。

政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地工人的就業機會。相關執法機關會視乎行動需要、風險評估及其他考慮因素，靈活調配人手持續執行情報主導的行動，有需要時會展開聯合行動，嚴厲打擊與非法勞工相關的罪行。

根據入境事務處的紀錄，二○二二年至二○二四年，每年分別有886‍名、1304名和1268名非法勞工被拘捕。今年一月至五‍月，被拘捕的非法勞工有506名。被捕的非法勞工主要從事與餐飲、建造、清潔或零售批發行業有關的工作。"

LCQ6: Safeguarding employment priority for local workers,2025-06-18 13:00,2025-06-18 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800272.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hak-kan and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 The number of imported workers approved under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) has exceeded 50 000 to date. On the other hand, the latest unemployment rate announced by the Government is 3.4 per cent, the highest in 27 months. Regarding the safeguarding of the employment priority for local workers, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it has been reported that some applicant enterprises have set unreasonable criteria to exclude local applicants when conducting local recruitment under ESLS, of the number of complaints or reports involving non-compliant local recruitment procedures in the past three years and, among them, the number of substantiated cases and the relevant penalties; of the mechanism in place for proactively reviewing the reasonableness of such recruitment criteria;

(2) as it has been reported that since ESLS requires enterprises to maintain a manning ratio of imported labour to local labour of no less than 1:2, some enterprises have employed local workers on a part-time basis or arranged for imported workers to take up positions inconsistent with those they applied for, whether the Government has looked into such situations; and

(3) of the number of illegal workers arrested in the past three years, together with a breakdown by the trade in which they were engaged; whether it has assessed if the existing penal measures against employers of illegal workers and the intermediaries concerned have sufficient deterrent effect?

Reply:

President,

  To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government has enhanced the mechanism for importation of labour. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

 In consultation with the Security Bureau, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) The LD has all along been stringently processing each application under ESLS. Applicant employers must undertake a four-week local recruitment exercise and accord priority to employing suitable local workers to fill the job vacancies. The LD will review and ascertain the employment terms, including the entry and academic qualification requirements, monthly salary and hours of work of all job vacancies posted by employers during the local recruitment. Employers taking on local job seekers through any recruitment channels during the local recruitment shall offer them employment terms no less favourable than those agreed by the LD.

  Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results to the LD and submit recruitment advertisements for verification. The LD will contact each of the local job seekers who is not employed by the employers, and assess whether the employers have sincerity in recruiting local workers. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment, or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable reasons, the LD will impose administrative sanction of terminating the processing of the application submitted by the concerned employer for importation of labour, and refusing to process other applications submitted by the employer in the following year. Since the implementation of ESLS, the LD has not detected any employer who has violated the requirements of local recruitment or received relevant complaint from job seekers.

(2) To safeguard the employment opportunities of local workers, ESLS requires relevant employers to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 on a continuous basis. Full-time employees refer to local employees who are directly employed by an employer and work not less than 35 hours per week for operating the relevant business, excluding part-time staff, staff of sub-contractor(s) or self-employed person(s) providing services to the employer. At the same time, the employer shall not displace local workers in employ with imported workers. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. To ensure that employers will not displace local workers in employ with imported workers, the LD has set up a dedicated hotline of 2150 6363. I appeal to employees who suspect that they have been dismissed owing to the employment of imported workers to call the hotline. The LD will follow up the complaints seriously. If substantiated, the LD will impose administrative sanction on the concerned employers, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted and refusal to process other applications submitted by the employers in the following two years.

  Besides, imported workers under ESLS must be employed under the Standard Employment Contract (SEC) prescribed by the Government, and shall perform specified duties for the specified job at the specific workplace(s) stipulated in the SEC.

  Labour Inspectors of the LD inspect workplaces of imported workers under ESLS from time to time to check whether employers have complied with the Employment Ordinance and the requirements of ESLS, and require employers to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratios. If an employer violates the relevant requirements, including failing to meet the manning ratio requirement or arranging imported workers to perform duties other than those stipulated in SEC, the LD will impose administrative sanction on the employer, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted to the employer and refusal to process other applications submitted by the employer for up to two years.

(3) Engaging in illegal employment is a serious offence. Employers, illegal workers as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance (IO). The IO stipulates different provisions targeting relevant offences committed by different groups of people. Visitors, illegal immigrants, overstayers, etc, are prohibited from taking up any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Aiders and abettors are liable to the same penalties. In addition, the Government amended the IO in 2021 to increase the penalty on employers of illegal workers, with the maximum penalty significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment with a view to reflecting the gravity of such offences. Besides, any person who takes up any employment, whether paid or unpaid, in contravention of a condition of stay shall be guilty of an offence.Upon conviction, he/she is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. In addition, if local employment agencies or their persons in relation are convicted of breaches of the IO, the LD may consider revoking or refusing the renewal of license for the concerned employment agencies. If the concerned persons apply for operating other employment agencies in future, the LD may also consider rejecting the issue of license.

  The Government is committed to combatting illegal employment, with a view to protecting the job opportunities for the local workforce. Relevant law enforcement agencies will, depending on operational needs, risk assessment and other considerations, flexibly arrange sufficient manpower to continuously conduct intelligence-led operations. When necessary, they will conduct joint operations to rigorously combat crimes related to illegal employment.

  According to the records of the Immigration Department, there were respectively 886, 1304 and 1268 illegal workers arrested each year during 2022 to 2024. 506 illegal workers were arrested during January to May 2025. The illegal workers arrested were mainly engaged in work related to the catering, construction, cleaning, or retail and wholesale industries."
AFCD to hold Local Organic Watermelon Festival 2025 (with photos),2025-06-18 13:00,2025-06-18 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061700364.htm,"âThe Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) will hold the Local Organic Watermelon Festival 2025 from June 20 to feature four highlighted varieties of organic watermelons this year.

A spokesman for the AFCD said today (June 18), ""The annual Local Organic Watermelon Festival promotes local organic watermelons and other premium agricultural products, enhances sustainability of local agriculture, and provides farmers with opportunities to share their harvests and engage with the public.""

At the Local Organic Watermelon Festival 2025, four highlighted varieties of watermelons, namely Reyan 2K, Hami Yellow Flesh, Super Sweet Black Angel 168 and Diana, will be featured. The Reyan 2K, a new variety introduced this year, is oblong with green, dark striped skin, has a thin rind and intense juicy red flesh with a sweetness of around 12 degrees Brix (degrees of Brix denote the units for measuring sucrose content in solution). The Hami Yellow Flesh, also oblong with dark green, striped skin, has yellowish-orange flesh and a sweetness of around 10 degrees Brix. The Super Sweet Black Angel 168 is small and spherical with dark striped skin and green and bright crimson-coloured flesh, also with a sweetness of around 12 degrees Brix. Diana, oblong with bright striped skin in yellow, features intense red flesh and a sweetness of around 11 degrees Brix. Local organic watermelons generally have a sweetness ranging from 8 to 12 degrees Brix.

The AFCD, together with the Vegetable Marketing Organization (VMO), the Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies Ltd and the MTR Corporation Limited will co-organise the first four-day organic farmers' market of the Local Organic Watermelon Festival 2025. The public can buy local organic agricultural products at Maritime Square 1 from June 20 to June 23. The event will also feature booth games and workshops, providing recreational activities for the public.

Furthermore, the AFCD will continue to invite all regular organic farmers' markets to join the Local Organic Watermelon Festival. Starting from July, the public can purchase local organic watermelons and other seasonal vegetables and fruits at organic farmers' markets across various districts. They can also order from the VMO via the ""Local Fresh"" website (www.localfreshhk.com) and mobile application or purchase from certified organic farmers listed on the Hong Kong Organic Resource Centre Certification Limited website (www.hkorc-cert.org/en). The opening dates and times of these farmers' markets are listed in the Annex. Local organic watermelons as well as other seasonal vegetables and fruits are available for a limited time while stocks last.

Having consulted the Highways Department (HyD), my reply to the various parts of the question raised by Hon Chan Siu-hung is as follows:

(1) In the past three years (i.e. from 2022 to 2024), the total length of roads maintained by the HyD each year was 2 223, 2 239 and 2 241 kilometres respectively. The annual expenditure on maintenance of roads and associated road facilities was about $1.70 billion, $1.73 billion, and $1.66 billion respectively.

The HyD ensures the safety and reliability of the public road network by engaging road maintenance contractors under term contracts to carry out regular inspection and maintenance work. When damage to road surfaces is identified during inspections or damages to roads and ancillary road facilities are reported by the public, the HyD would arrange contractors to carry out repair works as soon as possible to defects that may pose hazard to road users. As such repairs are part of the routine road maintenance work, the HyD does not separately keep statistics on the area of such type of road surface maintained.

Moreover, for defects that do not pose immediate danger to road safety, the HyD would formulate appropriate maintenance plan and schedule for such defects after taking into account various factors, such as arranging road resurfacing at a timely juncture. In each of the past three years (i.e. from 2022 to 2024), the areas of roads resurfaced and reconstructed by HyD are about 1.55, 1.77 and 1.65 million square metre respectively.

Currently, the HyD has a total of 9 road maintenance contracts for the maintenance of all public roads in Hong Kong, details of which are at Annex.

(2) At present, the Road Maintenance Monitoring System (RMMS), which is a system that fully digitalises the monitoring and administrative work of road maintenance, has been used in all road maintenance contracts. In the past, whenever the HyD's staff identified defects in road facilities during inspection, they were required to fill in and send the relevant physical form to the contractors upon completion of the inspections. With the RMMS, staff can now log on to the system during outdoor inspections and electronically notify the contractors of the information on damage to facilities captured on site, so that contractors can receive the relevant data promptly and arrange for repair works accordingly. After completion of repair works, contractors can also use RMMS to report the work done and submit maintenance records. The adoption of RMMS can cut down on complicated paperwork and transmission time to enhance work efficiency, facilitating HyD's staff to monitor the progress of maintenance. It resulted in better maintenance record keeping as well as reduction in the use of paper. In addition, the HyD is now developing the second phase of RMMS, which will incorporate more monitoring and management functions, such as automatic alerts or warnings to contractors with unsatisfactory maintenance progress, as well as digitalised checking procedures, etc.

In terms of cost-effectiveness, with the full implementation of the first phase of the RMMS, the average time taken by the HyD's staff to handle a case of damaged road facility (from the discovery of damage to road facility to the completion of the repair works) is about 20 per cent faster than before. Subsequently, upon completion and full adoption of the second phase of the RMMS, the HyD will then consider adjusting the manpower requirements of contractors for new road maintenance works. At that time, the HyD would re-assess the savings in manpower expenditure and works cost arising from the use of RMMS, as well as the cost-effectiveness of the system.

(3) The Road Defect Detection System (RDDS) utilises high-definition cameras installed on inspection patrol vehicles to capture images of road conditions, and employs global satellite positioning technology to record the locations of such images. It then uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to automatically identify road surface cracks and discoloured road markings, instead of relying on the visual inspection by road inspectors as in the past to ensure that the detection results are objective and accurate (above 90 per cent accuracy). Contractors use inspection patrol vehicles equipped with RDDS to carry out comprehensive inspection of all roads in Hong Kong once every three months. The detection results of road defects will be displayed on a web-based maintenance platform equipped with geographic information system maps, to facilitate maintenance personnel to locate the defects and carry out repair works. Moreover, the RDDS can consolidate relevant information into defect reports for maintenance personnel to record and audit the maintenance status. With enhanced inspection accuracy and maintenance records, the required maintenance works can be completed more swiftly and efficiently. At present, the RDDS has been incorporated as a standard operating procedure for road inspection on a regular basis. With the full adoption of RDDS, the average time taken by the contractors from completion of road inspection work to submission of the relevant inspection report has been substantially reduced from 48 hours to within 24 hours. To further enhance the efficiency of road maintenance, the HyD would expand the analytical capability of the AI system of the RDDS to identify more different types of road defects, such as overgrown vegetation, as well as discoloured/obstructed/bent traffic signs on the road surface.

The Road Condition Assessment System (RCAS), which scans three-dimensional images of road surfaces, uses patrol vehicles equipped with laser scanning equipment and global satellite positioning technology to drive on a carriageway at normal speed, and can automatically identify and accurately record various types of defects on the road surface such as potholes, rutting etc. It calculates a Pavement Condition Index (PCI) for every 100 metres of the road for the reference of engineering personnel responsible for maintenance to determine whether the section of road should be prioritised for reconstruction or resurfacing works. Compared to the past when road inspectors had to conduct visual inspection and measurement on the road surface after making road closure arrangements, which only covered a few hundred meters of carriageways per day at most, RCAS enables the maintenance team to have a more comprehensive grasp of the latest conditions of all road surfaces without the need for road closures. This allows for more effective use of resources when planning road maintenance works, and also helps avoid disruption to traffic.

The HyD expects that after using RCAS to inspect all major road sections in Hong Kong, it will be able to make more effective use of resources by prioritising sections with poorer conditions for road maintenance. RCAS is still in the trial stage and is capable of inspecting about 200 km of carriageways per day. It is expected that during the one year trial period, all major road sections in Hong Kong can be inspected and the data collected will be used for establishing a web-based maintenance platform for use by engineering staff.

As RCAS is still at the trial stage, the cost-effectiveness of the technology is still being assessed. However, according to preliminary estimation, the introduction of RCAS can free up about one-fourth of the manpower of the contractors' road inspection teams to cope with the increasing road maintenance work.

(4) Since 2024, the HyD has engaged various service contractors through road maintenance contracts to participate in the development of RCAS which is used to accurately record the undulations of road surfaces and identify road defects such as potholes, to facilitate the planning of road maintenance work. The aforesaid development project is broadly divided into three stages: in the first stage, the service contractors are required to procure vehicles and install laser scanning equipment and positioning devices on the vehicles; in the second stage, the service contractors are required to develop an AI and geometric analysis algorithm system to automatically detect road defects, assess road conditions, and establish a Geographic Information System (GIS) web-based platform to disseminate the relevant information; and in the third stage, the service contractors are required to utilise this system to scan all road surfaces in Hong Kong and automatically assess road conditions, as well as upload the assessment results to the GIS web-based platform at the same time. The first and second stages have been completed, while work on the third stage has commenced and is anticipated to be completed within this year. The HyD is evaluating the effectiveness of the entire smart road conditions analysis system and would consider incorporating this technology into the standard operating procedures for future road inspections in due course.

Currently, the RDDS is used for rapid identification of cracks on road surface and discoloured road markings which facilitates maintenance staff to locate road defects and expedite the completion of the required maintenance works, thereby enhancing maintenance efficiency. Meanwhile, RCAS focuses on accurately identifying and recording various types of defects on road surfaces and their degree of deterioration. It calculates the PCI for every 100m of carriageway which will help maintenance staff to determine whether a road section should be prioritised for resurfacing works. In view of the distinctive functions of RDDS and RCAS, as well as their differences in speed and accuracy in detecting road conditions, the positioning of their applications is thus different. These two systems will be implemented in parallel at this stage. However, the HyD will continue to develop the functions of RDDS and RCAS and will not rule out the possibility of merging them in the future when their functions, speed, and accuracy become comparable.

(5) According to the requirements of the existing Small Unmanned Aircraft (SUA) Order, the ""pilot"" controlling a SUA is required to maintain visual-line-of-sight with SUA under standard operation. The HyD's Regulatory Sandbox project utilises beyond visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) technology, coupled with 4G/5G command and control links, to enable SUA to operate beyond the pilot's line-of-sight in a safer and more stable manner, up to a distance of several kilometres. This enables flexible deployment for surveying and inspecting road infrastructures and major trunk roads during emergencies, such as landslides, as well as routine operation.

In emergency situations, with the adoption of BVLOS technology, SUA can swiftly reach a remote landslide site and calculate a three-dimensional model of the slope through aerial photographs taken, which facilitates engineers to accurately measure the area and volume of landslide debris in support of slope restoration work. In addition, under extreme weather condition, SUA can be operated to fly along designated pre-set routes to quickly see whether there are any flooding, fallen trees, or other obstructions on major highways. For routine surveys and inspections, BVLOS technology can assist in the inspections in places such as cross-sea bridges, confined spaces and elevated structures that are difficult for engineering personnel to access or visually inspect. Such technology can be regularly applied to routine operations, such as surface defect inspection of bridge structures and slope restoration works.

The test flights of the Regulatory Sandbox project are conducted in stages under different scenarios, at locations including Tai Po Waterfront Pier to Sam Mun Tsai, Tseung Kwan O Tunnel Road, Tseung Kwan O Cross Bay Link, Tate's Cairn Highway, and Ap Lei Chau Bridge. These simulated flights carry out BVLOS inspections of slopes along the roads at the above locations and the related major trunk roads, with flying distances ranging from 200m to 2 000m. Among them, the HyD has already completed the trial flights at the first two test sites, with the remaining three expected to be completed in phases by the end of September 2025."
立法會十二題：公共道路的維修保養,2025-06-18 12:50,2025-06-18 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800251.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上陳紹雄議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉，路政署採用創新科技及推展數字化管理，以提升道路維修和保養工程服務的效率。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年全港公共道路的總長度、已維修公共道路總長度及用於維修公共道路的總工程費用分別為何；就該等道路維修及保養工作所批出的合約詳情（包括但不限於承建商名稱、涉及區域、合約年期、涉及道路長度及合約金額）分別為何；

（二）鑑於政府於去年三月二十七日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，路政署的目標是在二○二四年內把所有道路維修合約的大部分巡查及監督程序數碼化，相關工作的進展為何；有否評估，採用創新科技如何提高道路檢測的效率及成本效益，包括所節省的人手開支及工程成本；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於根據路政署資料，該署正採用人工智能偵測道路欠妥系統（RDDS）和激光掃描路面三維影像的路面狀況評估系統（RCAS）檢測道路情況，該兩套技術系統的應用場景、應用階段（例如處於試驗階段或已轉為恆常使用）、檢測效率及成本效益分別為何；

（四）鑑於路政署估算，引入RCAS能釋放承建商巡路隊約四分之一的人手，而該署正評估RCAS的成效，並會適時考慮將其全面應用並納入日後道路巡查的標準作業程序，相關工作的最新進展為何，以及有否研究，RDDS及RCAS兩套系統未來的應用模式是雙軌並行，或是擇一而行；及

（五）鑑於路政署是低空經濟「監管沙盒」首批試點項目的入選申請機構，該署涉及道路維修保養及勘察的試點項目（包括但不限於項目內容、應用場景、飛行路徑、航線規劃及飛行距離）的詳情為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳議員提問的各部分，經諮詢路政署後，現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年（即二○二二年至二○二四年），每年由路政署保養的道路總長度分別為2 223、2 239及2 241公里，而每年維修道路及相關道路設施的開支則分別約為17億元、17億3千萬元及16億6千萬元。

路政署透過定期合約委聘道路維修承建商進行定期巡查及維修保養工作，以確保公共道路網絡的安全和可靠性。當在巡查時發現路面有損毀或接獲市民意見指路面或附屬道路設施有破損時，路政署會安排承建商盡快對可能構成道路危險的損毀進行修復工作。由於這些修葺工作屬於日常道路維修工作的一部分，所以路政署並沒有就這類的維修道路面積分別作統計。

此外，對於不會對道路安全構成即時危險的破損，路政署會在考慮不同因素後，為該些破損制定合適的維修計劃和時間表，例如適時為路面進行重鋪工程。過去三年（即二○二二年至二○二四年），每年路政署重鋪及重建道路的面積分別約為1.55、1.77及1.65百萬平方米。

目前路政署共有九份道路維修工程合約，負責全港公共道路的維修護養，合約詳情見附件。

（二）現時，電子化道路維修監察系統（Road Maintenance Monitoring System, RMMS）已在所有道路維修工程合約中使用。RMMS是將道路維修的監察及行政工作全面電子化的系統。每當路政署工程人員在巡查時發現有道路設施受損，過去的做法是要工程人員在完成巡查後填寫並傳送有關的實體表格至承建商。通過RMMS，現時工程人員在戶外巡查時只需登入系統，便能把實地擷取有關設施受損的資料以電子方式通知承建商，承建商迅即可收到有關資料並安排維修工作。承建商在完成維修工作後亦可使用RMMS匯報完工及提交維修記錄。採用RMMS能減省繁複的文書工作及傳送時間，以提高工作效率，方便路政署工程人員監察維修進度，不但令維修保養記錄做得更妥善，亦可以減少使用紙張。此外，路政署正在開發RMMS的第二階段，將納入更多監察管理功能，例如對維修進度不理想的承建商自動發出提示或警告、電子化的審查程序等。

就成本效益方面，隨着RMMS首階段的全面使用後，現時路政署工程人員處理道路設施受損個案（從發現道路設施受損至完成有關設施的修復工作）的平均時間比過往快約20%。及後，當RMMS完成第二階段的開發且全面使用後，路政署會考慮在新道路維修工程中調整承建商在人力資源上的要求。屆時，路政署將再次評估使用RMMS可節省的人手開支及工程成本，以及系統的成本效益。

（三）人工智能偵測道路欠妥系統（Road Defect Detection System, RDDS）利用在巡路檢測車上安裝的高清相機拍攝路面情況，並用全球衛星定位技術記錄相片位置，再以人工智能技術自動識別路面裂縫及褪色路面標記，代替過往依靠巡路人員的目測，確保偵測的結果客觀而且準確（準確度達90%以上）。承建商利用配備RDDS設備的巡路檢測車，每三個月為全港的道路進行一次全面的偵測，道路欠妥偵測結果會顯示在配備地理資訊系統地圖的網絡維修平台上，方便維修人員找出欠妥位置及進行維修。此外，RDDS亦可整合有關資料作為欠妥報告，方便維修人員記錄和審核維修情況。當道路巡查的準確度及維修記錄得到提升後，就能加快完成所需的維修工程，提升維修效率。現時，RDDS已被納入為道路巡查的標準作業程序作恆常使用。在全面採用RDDS後，承建商從完成道路檢測工作至提交有關的道路檢測報告所需的時間平均由48小時大幅縮短至24小時內。為了進一步提升道路維修的工作效率，路政署將會擴展RDDS人工智能系統的分析能力，以識別更多不同類型的道路欠妥狀況，例如路面上生長過剩的雜草和褪色／受遮擋／彎曲的交通路牌等。

激光掃描路面三維影像的路面狀況評估系統（Road Condition Assessment System, RCAS）利用配備激光掃描設備及全球衛星定位技術的檢測車以正常車速在行車路上行駛，能自動識別並準確記錄路面上各種類型的缺陷，例如坑洞、車轍等，並計算出每100米行車道的路面狀況指數供負責維修的工程人員參考，決定該段路是否優先需要進行重建或重鋪工程。相對過去需要靠巡路員作封路安排後在路面上目測及量度，每天最多只能檢測數百米的行車道的速度，RCAS能在無須進行封路的情況下讓負責維修的同事更全面掌握所有路面的最新狀況，更有效地運用資源進行規劃道路維修工作，亦能避免對交通造成影響。

路政署期望利用RCAS在香港所有主要路段作檢測後，能更有效地運用資源去選擇路面狀況較差的路段以進行道路維修工作。RCAS現在仍處於試驗階段，每天能檢測約200公里的行車道，期望於一年的試用階段中能為香港所有的主要路段作檢測，並透過收集相關數據以建立有關的網絡維修平台供工程人員使用。

由於RCAS仍然處於試驗階段，技術的成本效益仍在評估當中。但根據初步估算，引入RCAS能釋放承建商巡路隊約四分之一的人手以應付日益增加的道路維修工作。

（四）路政署自二○二四年起透過道路維修保養合約，聘請不同服務承辦商參與研發RCAS，用以精確地記錄路面的起伏，並找出坑洞等路面缺損情況，協助計劃道路維修保養的工作。上述研發項目大致分為三個階段：在第一階段，服務承辦商需要購置車輛，並於車輛安裝雷射掃描及定位裝置；在第二階段，服務承辦商需開發人工智能及幾何分析算法系統，以自動偵測路面缺損並評核路面狀況，以及建立地理信息系統網絡平台發放相關資料；在第三階段，服務承辦商需利用系統掃描全港路面及自動評估路面狀況，同時將評估結果上傳到地理信息系統網絡平台。現時第一及第二階段已完成，第三階段工作亦已展開，預計今年內完成。路政署正評估整個智慧道路分析系統的成效，亦會適時考慮將該項技術納入為日後道路巡查的標準作業程序。

現時，RDDS應用於快速識別路面裂縫及褪色路面標記，方便維修人員找出欠妥位置及加快完成所需的維修工程，從而提升維修效率。RCAS則專注於精準識別並準確記錄路面上各種類型的缺陷及其破損程度，並計算出每100米行車道的路面狀況指數，有助負責維修的工程人員決定該段路是否需要優先進行路面重鋪工程。鑑於RDDS和RCAS的功能不同，偵測路況的速度和準確度有別，所以應用的定位也不同，現階段兩個系統將會雙軌並行。然而，路政署會繼續研發RDDS及RCAS的功能，並不排除在將來當兩個系統的功能、速度和準確度相若時將其合併。

（五）按現行《小型無人機令》要求，控制小型無人機的「機手」在一般標準操作下，需與小型無人機保持目視距離。路政署的「監管沙盒」項目利用超視距技術，配合4G／5G指揮與控制鏈路，讓小型無人機可以更安全及穩定地在「機手」視線範圍之外飛行，距離可達數公里，可更靈活應用在緊急情況如山泥傾瀉及常規操作下對道路基礎設施及主要幹線進行的測量和巡查。

在緊急情況下，透過採用超視距無人機技術，小型無人機能迅速到達偏遠的山泥傾瀉事故現場，並透過所拍攝的航空照片計算出斜坡的三維模型，有利工程人員準確地量度山泥面積及體積，以支援斜坡復修工作；另外，在極端天氣下，小型無人機亦能沿指定預設路線飛行，有助迅速查看主要公路上是否有水浸、倒樹或其他障礙物倒路。就日常的測量和巡查而言，超視距無人機技術可協助於跨海大橋、密閉空間以及工程人員比較難到達及目視的架空結構等地方進行檢測，能恆常應用於橋樑結構表面欠妥檢查、斜坡修復等常規作業。

該「監管沙盒」項目分階段在不同場景進行試飛，地點分別為大埔海濱碼頭至三門仔、將軍澳隧道公路、將軍澳跨灣大橋、大老山公路和鴨脷洲大橋，模擬為上述地點沿路的斜坡和相關的主要幹線進行超視距巡查，飛行距離約為200米至2 000米不等。其中，路政署已完成首兩個測試地點的試飛，餘下三個亦預期將於二○二五年九月底前分階段完成。"
立法會八題：非長者一人申請者輪候公共租住房屋,2025-06-18 12:47,2025-06-18 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800331.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上郭偉强議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

本人近月曾接觸一批基層住戶，當中有數名青年原本在「天倫樂」優先配屋計劃下輪候公共租住房屋（公屋）多年，可惜其家人在獲編配公屋前便離世，令他們只能以「非長者一人申請者」的身分繼續輪候公屋。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在二○二二年至二○二四年期間，每年（i）非長者一人申請者獲安排詳細資格審查（俗稱「見主任」）的分數、（ii）非長者一人申請者獲安排入住公屋時的最高及最低年齡，以及（iii）編配予非長者一人申請者的單位配額數量及其佔當年公屋單位總供應量的比例分別為何；

（二）鑑於《2024年施政報告》提出，二○二五／二○二六年度至二○二九／二○三○年度總體公營房屋供應量將達189 000伙，較本屆政府上任時的五年期（即二○二二／二○二三年度至二○二六／二○二七年度）增加約80%，而在過去兩年，公屋平均輪候時間已由高峰6.1年回落至5年半，政府有否計劃增加和預留公屋單位配額予非長者一人申請者；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）為了讓非長者一人申請者考慮應否持續輪候公屋，政府可否適時地向他們提供更多關於計分制的資訊，例如按照分數高低將非長者一人申請者平均劃分為10‍個組別，並公布每個組別申請者的最高及最低分數，讓非長者一人申請者知悉自己的所處組別及輪候狀況，從而協助他們評估輪候時間？

答覆:

主席：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）的宗旨是為不能負擔租住私人樓宇的人士提供公共租住房屋（公屋）。按房委會的政策，在編配公屋單位時，一般申請者（即家庭申請者及長者一人申請者）會較非長者一人申請者優先得到照顧。就郭偉强議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五年度，非長者一人申請者獲安排詳細資格審查的分數、非長者一人申請者獲安排入住公屋單位時的最高及最低年齡及非長者一人申請者佔年度實際編配的比例分別載於附件表一至表三。

（二）為了理順及訂定編配公屋予非長者一人申請者的優先次序，房委會於二○○五年九月起實施「配額及計分制」。有別於一般申請者，非長者一人申請者獲編配公屋的優先次序，並非按個別申請者加入隊伍的時間，而是取決於他在「配額及計分制」下所累積的總分數。有關分數視乎申請者的年齡、輪候時間以及是否已居於公屋而定。

房委會在二○一四年十月通過修訂「配額及計分制」，當中包括增加年齡分數，把申請時年齡每增添一歲可得的分數，由三分增加至九分，以減低盡早申請的誘因；以及給予年屆45歲的非長者一人申請者一次性額外60分，使他們的優先次序高於其他較年輕的申請者。此外，房委會亦由二○一五／一六年度起增加「配額及計分制」下非長者一人申請者的配額，由每年佔擬編配予公屋申請者單位總數的8%增加至10%，單位上限從2 000個增加至2 200個。經修訂的「配額及計分制」下，一般而言，較年長人士會較快獲得編配單位。以上增加配額單位上限的安排，已在非長者一人申請者和一般申請者的需求之間取得適當的平衡。考慮到目前社會對公屋需求仍然十分殷切，我們現階段並沒有計劃再增加「配額及計分制」下的配額。

我們並不鼓勵年青人盡早申請公屋。年青人應把握時光，努力工作，從而按自己的能力選擇合適的房屋階梯上流。事實上，非長者一人申請者的數目已由二○一五年十二月底最高位的143 700宗大幅下跌近40%至二○二五年三月底的86 300宗。同一期間，年齡為30歲以下的非長者一人申請的跌幅更為明顯，由74 500宗下跌57%至31 700宗。

政府一直透過提供不同種類的資助出售單位，鼓勵青年置業。事實上，在各資助出售單位的買家中，40歲以下青年一直佔較大比例。舉例而言，成功購買一手居者有其屋計劃（居屋）單位的申請者有近一半是40歲以下青年；另外，約80%的「白表居屋第二市場計劃」（白居二）買家是40歲以下。

在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），除了公屋／綠表置居計劃單位外，房委會和香港房屋協會將會有約56 500個資助出售單位的供應。為增加青年成功購買資助出售單位的機會，房委會會由下一期居屋起為40歲以下申請購買居屋單位的白表青年家庭及一人申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼；而在第二市場方面，房委會亦已由「白居二2024」起，增加1 500個配額至6 000個，並將新增配額全數撥予40歲以下的青年家庭及一人申請者。

（三）「配額及計分制」下的優次是取決於非長者一人申請者在計分制下所累積的總分數。為增加資訊透明度，房屋署會每月於報章刊登各分區最新的公屋編配進度，包括非長者一人申請者正獲安排詳細資格審查的申請之最低分數，以及個別申請地區內已接受配房的最低分數，並將有關資料上載至房委會／房屋署網頁（www.housingauthority.gov.hk/tc/flat-application/allocation-status/index.html），供申請者參考。

此外，「公屋申請電子服務」（eservices.housingauthority.gov.hk/eprhas）亦提供24小時網上服務，讓公屋申請者透過「智方便+」遞交公屋申請表、查詢目前申請進度、更改申請資料或詳細資格審查面晤的日期和時間等。"
LCQ8: Non-elderly one-person applicants waiting for public rental housing,2025-06-18 12:47,2025-06-18 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800355.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kwok Wai-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

  I have contacted a group of grass-roots households in recent months, several of whom are young people who have been waiting for public rental housing (PRH) under the Harmonious Families Priority Scheme for years. Unfortunately, their family members passed away before they were allocated PRH, leaving them to continue waiting for PRH as ""non-elderly one-person applicants"". In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1)of, in each year between 2022 and 2024, (i) the number of score points that non-elderly one-person applicants needed to obtain to be arranged for detailed vetting (commonly known as ""being interviewed by an officer""), (ii) the respective ages of the oldest and the youngest non-elderly one-person applicants at the time when they were allocated PRH, and (iii) the quota of PRH units for allocation to non-elderly one-person applicants and its share in the total number of PRH units supplied for that year;

(2)as the 2024 Policy Address has proposed that the total public housing supply from 2025-2026 to 2029-2030 will reach 189 000 units, which is about 80 per cent higher than that of the first five-year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-2023 to 2026-2027), and in the past two years, the average waiting time for PRH dropped from the peak of 6.1 years to the current 5.5 years, whether the Government has plans to increase the quota of PRH units reserved for non-elderly one-person applicants; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3)to enable non-elderly one-person applicants to consider whether they should continue waiting for PRH, whether the Government can provide them with more information on the Points System in a timely manner, such as by dividing the non-elderly one-person applicants into 10 groups evenly according to their score points and publishing the highest and lowest score points of applicants in each group, so that the applicants will know which group they are in and their waiting status, thereby helping them to assess their waiting time?

Reply:

President,

  The objective of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) is to provide public rental housing (PRH) to people who cannot afford private rental accommodation. It is the policy of the HA to accord priority to general applicants (i.e. family applicants and elderly-one person applicants) over non-elderly one-person applicants in the allocation of PRH flats. The reply to the Hon Kwok Wai-keung's question is as follows:

(1) From 2022/23 to 2024/25, the points for non-elderly one person applicants arranged for detailed vetting, the highest and lowest ages of non-elderly one-person applicants that were housed to PRH flats and the ratio of actual allocation for non-elderly one-person applicants to the actual annual allocation are set out in Tables 1 to 3 of the Annex respectively.

(2) In order to rationalise and prioritise the allocation of PRH to non-elderly one-person applicants, the HA implemented the Quota and Points System (QPS) since September 2005. Unlike general applicants, the priority of flat allocation to non-elderly one-person applicants is not determined by the time when the individual applicant joined the queue, but the total points accumulated by an individual applicant under QPS. The points are calculated based on the applicants' age, their waiting time and whether they are already residing in PRH.

  The HA endorsed refining QPS in October 2014. Such refinements included increasing the scale of age points from three to nine points per year of age increase at the time of application to reduce the incentive for early registration; and awarding a one-off bonus of 60 points to non-elderly one-person applicants aged 45 or above so as to accord them with higher priority over other younger applicants. In addition, starting from 2015/16, the HA has also increased the annual allocation quota for non-elderly one-person applicants under QPS from 8 per cent to 10 per cent of the total number of units to be allocated to PRH applicants, subject to a cap which was increased from 2 000 to 2 200 units. Generally speaking, elder applicants will be allocated flats faster under the refined QPS. The above arrangement of increasing the cap of allocation quota has struck an appropriate balance between the needs of non-elderly one-person applicants and that of general applicants. Considering that the demand for PRH in the society remains strong currently, we have no plan to further increase the annual allocation quota for QPS at this stage.

  We do not encourage young people to apply for PRH early. Young people should seize their time and work hard to move up the housing ladder in accordance with their abilities. In fact, the number of non-elderly one-person applicants reduced significantly by about 40 per cent from the highest level of 143 700 as at end-December 2015 to 86 300 as at end-March 2025. During the same period, the number of non-elderly one-person applicants aged below 30 recorded a sharper decline of 57 per cent, from 74 500 to 31 700.

  The Government has been encouraging young people to buy their own homes through the provision of various types of subsidised sale flats (SSF). In fact, young people aged below 40 have always accounted for a large proportion of buyers of different types of SSF. For example, nearly half of the successful applicants for first-hand Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats are young people under the age of 40; meanwhile, around 80 per cent of the buyers of White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) are under the age of 40.

  In the next five years (i.e. from 2025/26 to 2029/30), apart from PRH/ Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme flats, the HA and the Hong Kong Housing Society will have a supply of about 56 500 SSF. To increase the chances of young people in purchasing SSF successfully, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to young family applicants and one-person applicants aged below 40 with white form status for the purchase of HOS flats starting from the next HOS sale exercise onwards; for the secondary market, starting from WSM 2024, the HA has also increased the quota by 1 500 to 6 000, all of which will be allocated to young family applicants and one-person applicants aged below 40.
 
(3) The priority under QPS is determined by the total points accumulated by an non-elderly one-person applicant. To enhance the transparency of information, the Housing Department (HD) publishes the latest PRH allocation status in different districts in newspapers on a monthly basis, including the lowest point for non-elderly one person applicants being arranged for detailed vetting and the lowest point for non-elderly one person applicants having accepted public housing offers in individual application district. Such information is also uploaded to the HA/HD website (www.housingauthority.gov.hk/en/flat-application/allocation-status/index.html) for applicants' reference.

  In addition, ""e-Services for PRH Application"" (eservices.housingauthority.gov.hk/eprhas) also provides 24-hour online services for PRH applicants. Through ""iAM Smart+"", applicants can submit their PRH applications, enquire about their application status, amend the application information, and change the date and time of the detailed vetting interview, etc."
立法會二題：子女免稅額,2025-06-18 12:40,2025-06-18 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800335.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上林琳議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的答覆：

問題：

根據《稅務條例》，同住夫婦的所有合資格子女免稅額，只可由其中一方申索，而他們須自行決定由誰人提出申索。有意見認為，有關安排或令家庭內部出現爭拗。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於現代夫婦通常共同承擔照顧子女的責任（包括在經濟及照顧上），現時只可由其中一方申索子女免稅額的原因為何；

（二）有否研究修訂法例，訂明育有子女的夫婦，可平均分配或各自申索子女免稅額；如有，具體計劃及時間表為何，包括會否考慮引入預設分配機制（例如可選擇平均分配或按夫妻收入比例自動分配免稅額、賦予稅務局裁定權限，或就申索優先次序訂立明確準則）；如未有研究修例，原因為何；及

（三）在現時未有修例的情況下，政府會否考慮制訂一套子女免稅額的參考指引，例如申索次序可按家庭收入比例、主要撫養角色或過往申索慣例等處理，並加強公眾教育，以協助家庭妥善安排免稅額申索；如會，具體計劃及時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

根據《稅務條例》（第112章）（《條例》）第31條，薪俸稅納稅人如供養未婚子女，而子女在課稅年度未滿18歲；或年滿18歲但未滿25歲，並在教育機構接受全日制教育；或年滿18歲，但因身體或精神問題無能力工作，則納稅人可以在有關課稅年度申索子女免稅額。納稅人最多可就九名子女申索免稅額。由二○二三／二四課稅年度起，每名子女的免稅額為130,000元，在每名新生子女出生的課稅年度，其免稅額可獲額外增加130,000元。

就林琳議員的問題第（一）至（三）部分，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）根據《條例》第31（3）條，除非納稅人與其配偶分開居住，否則全部子女免稅額須由納稅人或其配偶其中一方申索，納稅人及其配偶須共同決定由哪一方提出所有申索。這項規定於一九八九年開始容許已婚人士選擇與配偶分開評稅或合併評稅時納入《條例》，並一直有效沿用至今，主要的考量如下：

在二○○三／○四課稅年度之前，子女免稅額會按申報的子女數目以累退制訂定，由二○○三／○四課稅年度起，第一至九名子女均可享有劃一免稅額。儘管如此，現行機制已提供足夠選項及彈性減輕夫婦的稅務負擔，加上超過六成申索子女免稅額的納稅人只就一名子女申索免稅額，我們認為無需要取消只可以由納稅人或其配偶其中一方申索子女免稅額的規定。現時，已婚人士可選擇與配偶分開評稅或合併評稅，從而節省稅款。由其中一方申索全部子女免稅額或允許雙方分開申索個別子女的免稅額，並不影響合併評稅下須繳交的稅款總額。在現行安排下，即使已婚人士及其配偶沒有主動選擇合併評稅，稅務局仍會比較二人分開評稅及合併評稅的應繳稅款。如果發現合併評稅對他們更有利，稅務局將邀請他們選擇合併評稅。此外，《條例》並無規定同一名子女的免稅額必須一直由相同的申索人申請。如納稅人及其配偶選擇分開評稅，他們可事先協商子女免稅額的申索方式，靈活地自行安排在不同課稅年度申索子女免稅額，例如輪流在不同年度申索，以符合個別家庭需要。

我們認為現行的機制行之有效，既可減輕夫婦的稅務負擔，亦為納稅人提供靈活便捷的報稅流程，讓他們可因應家庭情況作出合適的稅務安排，無需容許納稅人及其配偶分開申索子女免稅額。稅務局現時只會在夫婦分居或離婚的情況下按實際情況分攤子女免稅額。這安排有助減低納稅人的合規負擔和確保稅務局的評稅效率。

另一方面，因應每個家庭的具體情況和需要不盡相同，納稅人及其配偶可能有不同的財政及稅務安排。我們無計劃改變稅務局一般不會介入家庭事務的做法，引入預設分配機制，因為這不可能符合所有家庭的需要。

政府會繼續不時檢視各項免稅額的申索安排和水平，並因應受惠人數、政府的財政狀況和行政效率等多項因素，以考慮是否有優化的空間。

（三）稅務局現時已於其網頁提供有關子女免稅額的常見問題及參考指引。一般而言，由入息較高的一方申索子女免稅額會更有利。不過，如其中一方是以標準稅率評稅，則會由並非以標準稅率評稅的另一方申索會更為有利。網頁亦設有稅款計算機，方便納稅人及配偶輸入各自的入息款額、扣除及不同的免稅額分配情況等，以作出最合適的申索安排。此外，稅務局於每年五月發出個別人士報稅表後，會延長電話查詢服務時間，解答納稅人在填寫報稅表時遇到的問題。

多謝主席。"
LCQ2: Child allowance,2025-06-18 12:40,2025-06-18 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800340.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Nixie Lam and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 Under the Inland Revenue Ordinance, all eligible child allowances for married couples residing together can only be claimed by one of them, and they must decide on their own who should make the claims. There are views that such arrangement may give rise to disputes within the family. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that modern married couples usually share the responsibility of taking care of their children (both financially and in terms of care), of the reasons why child allowances can only be claimed by one of them at present;

(2) whether it has studied amending the legislation to stipulate that married couples with children may allocate child allowances equally or claim child allowances separately; if so, of the specific plan and timetable, including whether it will consider introducing a default allocation mechanism (such as allowing a choice of equal allocation of allowances or automatic allocation of allowances according to the ratio of the married couples' incomes, empowering the Inland Revenue Department to make rulings or setting clear criteria on the priority of making claims); if it has not studied amending the legislation, of the reasons for that; and

(3) whether, in the absence of legislative amendments at present, the Government will consider drawing up a set of reference guidelines on child allowances, e.g. the order of claims may be handled according to the ratio of family incomes, major child-rearing roles or previous claiming practices, etc, as well as stepping up public education, so as to assist families in making proper arrangements for claiming allowances; if so, of the specific plan and timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 According to Section 31 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (Ordinance), a taxpayer for salaries tax may claim child allowance for a year of assessment if he/she maintains an unmarried child who is under 18 years old; of or over 18 but under 25 years old and receiving full time education at an educational institution; or of or over 18 years old and is, because of physical or mental disability, unable to work in that year of assessment. A taxpayer may claim child allowance for up to nine children. Starting from the year of assessment 2023/24, the allowance for each child is $130,000. An additional allowance of $130,000 is granted for a newborn child during the year of assessment of the child's birth.

 My reply to parts 1-3 of the Hon Nixie Lam's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) According to Section 31(3) of the Ordinance, unless a taxpayer and his/her spouse are living apart, all child allowances must be claimed en bloc by either the taxpayer or his/her spouse. Taxpayers and their spouse should jointly decide who will claim all the child allowances. This requirement was included in the Ordinance in 1989, when married persons started to be allowed to elect separate taxation or joint assessment with their spouse, and has been in force until today. The main considerations are as follows:

 Before the year of assessment 2003/04, the amount of child allowance was determined by the number of children claimed on a regressive basis. Starting from the year of assessment 2003/04, the 1st to the 9th child are granted with a uniform allowance. Nevertheless, the prevailing mechanism already provides sufficient options and flexibility to reduce the tax burden on married persons, and more than 60 per cent of taxpayers claiming child allowances claim for only one child. We therefore consider that there is no need to abolish the requirement that only a taxpayer or his/her spouse can claim child allowance. Currently, married persons may elect separate taxation or joint assessment with their spouse for tax savings. Having all child allowances claimed by one party or allowing both parties to separately claim allowances for individual child or children does not affect the total amount of tax payable under joint assessment. Under the current arrangement, even if married persons and their spouse do not elect joint assessment on their own initiative, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) would still compare their tax payable under separate taxation and joint assessment. If joint assessment is found to be more beneficial to them, the IRD would invite them to elect joint assessment. In addition, the Ordinance does not require that the allowance in respect of the same child must always be claimed by the same claimant. If taxpayers and their spouse choose separate taxation, they may discuss in advance on how to claim the child allowance and flexibly arrange to claim the child allowance for different years of assessment, such as taking turns to claim in different years, to meet the needs of individual families.

 We find the current mechanism effective in reducing the tax burden on married persons and providing taxpayers with a flexible and convenient tax filing process, allowing them to make appropriate tax arrangements according to their family situations. There is no need to allow taxpayers and their spouse to separately claim child allowances. Currently, the IRD only apportions the child allowance based on actual circumstances for living apart or divorced cases. This arrangement helps reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers and ensure the IRD's efficiency of tax assessment.

 On the other hand, as the specific circumstances and needs of each family vary, taxpayers and their spouse may have different financial and tax arrangements. We have no plans to change the current practice of the IRD generally not intervening in family matters to introduce a default allocation mechanism, as it is unlikely to meet the needs of all families.

The Government will continue to review the claim arrangements and levels of various allowances from time to time, and consider whether there is room for enhancement based on various factors such as the number of beneficiaries, the Government's financial situation, and administrative efficiency.

(3) The IRD currently provides frequently asked questions and guidelines on child allowances on its website. Generally speaking, it is more beneficial for the party with higher income to claim child allowance. However, if one party is assessed at standard rates, it would be more beneficial for the other party who is not assessed at standard rates to claim the allowance. The website also features a tax calculator, allowing taxpayers and their spouses to input their respective income amounts, deductions, and different allowance distribution scenarios to make the most appropriate claim arrangements. Besides, after issuing individual tax returns in May of each year, the IRD will extend the service hours of telephone enquiry to answer questions from taxpayers about completing their tax returns.

Thank you, Mr President."
立法會三題：預防長者自殺,2025-06-18 12:30,2025-06-18 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800289.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上狄志遠議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

關於預防長者自殺，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，過去五年關於長者自殺的詳細數據，包括但不限於每年自殺宗數、60歲以上人士與其他年齡層人士自殺率的比較、自殺長者的性別、年齡及地區分布，以及涉及精神健康問題的個案比例；有否深入研究香港長者自殺的問題；如有，主要的自殺誘因及所佔比例，以及高危群體的特徵為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）目前有哪些針對長者心理健康及預防其自殺的具體措施，尤其針對高危長者的專門支援措施，以及有關的資源分配情況為何；有否評估該等措施的成效；如有，詳情為何；及

（三）鑑於有社福界人士建議，政府應設立「獨居長者及雙老家庭高危名冊」，政府會否考慮有關建議；如會，詳情為何，包括名冊的更新頻率、對名冊內長者所提供的支援，以及政府會否與醫院管理局及非政府組織等共享數據，以合作支援有關長者？

答覆：

主席：

長者自殺涉及多項因素，並無單一主要原因，例如情緒問題、個人健康及家庭關係等。就議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局、醫院管理局（醫管局）、衞生署和社會福利署（社署），現綜合回覆如下：

依照《死因裁判官條例》（香港法例第504章），共有20類死亡個案須向死因裁判官報告，包括自殺身亡的個案。二○二○年至二○二四年長者自殺個案的相關數據載於附件。數字顯示近年60歲或以上人士自殺身亡的個案數字大致平穩，在所有個案中的佔比略有下降。

政府近年並未就長者自殺的課題進行特定研究，但一直十分重視長者的精神健康，並推行不同措施，改善長者心理健康和防止長者自殺。舉例來說，衞生署長者健康中心為長者會員提供健康評估，包括以國際認可適用於本地長者並針對抑鬱症狀（包括自殺念頭）的健康篩查工具，及早偵測及預防長者自殺。長者健康中心的醫護人員遇有抑鬱和自殺風險的個案，會轉介至急症室即時處理。

除衞生署外，醫管局針對有自殺風險的長者，自二○○二年起推行防止長者自殺計劃，為懷疑有自殺傾向的長者提供適時和適切的精神科診斷及治療，以減低有關長者的自殺風險。在計劃下，由醫生或社工評估為有自殺風險的長者會獲轉介醫管局精神科，及早作進一步跟進、診斷及合適的治理。

此外，醫管局及社署透過七個醫管局聯網及41個長者地區中心以「醫社合作」模式，推行「智友醫社同行計劃」，加強社區層面的護理服務元素，為患有輕度或中度認知障礙症的長者在社區內提供適切的支援服務，以穩定他們的病情及減輕他們進出醫院的困擾，並讓他們的照顧者得到相關的支援。政府的「情緒通」18111精神健康支援熱線亦每日24小時向受情緒困擾的人士（包括長者）提供一站式支援服務，包括即時的精神健康支援及轉介服務。

另一方面，社署提供多元化的服務，識別及支援有情緒困擾及／或有自殺危機的長者。在主流服務方面，全港214個資助長者中心為長者及其照顧者提供關懷探訪、情緒支持及輔導等服務。全港65個綜合家庭服務中心和兩個綜合服務中心為有需要的家庭提供預防、支援和補救性服務。全港58個設於醫院及診所的醫務社會服務部亦提供輔導及支援服務，社工在處理個案時會評估受助人的自殺風險。此外，社署提供資助，委聘非政府機構在全港營辦24個精神健康綜合社區中心，提供由預防以至危機管理的一站式、以地區為本的社區支援服務。在專門服務方面，社署資助香港撒瑪利亞防止自殺會營運自殺危機處理中心，為有中度／高度自殺風險的人士提供外展、危機介入、深入輔導等服務。除社署的服務外，非政府機構生命熱線自二○○六年起獲香港賽馬會慈善信託基金資助，開展「生命共行－外展長者服務」，以外展形式及早識別受情緒困擾或有自殺風險的長者。此外，社署亦營運及資助非政府機構為受情緒困擾人士（包括有自殺傾向人士）提供熱線服務，因應受助人的需要，鼓勵及轉介他們到相關服務單位接受深入輔導服務。其中，24小時運作的照顧者支援專線182 183由專業社工為有需要的照顧者（包括年長的照顧者）提供即時諮詢和輔導、外展、緊急支援及轉介等服務。

二○二四年《施政報告》宣布，政府會研究建立跨專業、跨機構的護老者和殘疾人士照顧者資料庫。政府正研究整合分散在不同部門、機構的社福服務相關數據資料，以構建數據平台，通過共享與分析數據，推動跨部門協作和服務創新，提高服務效率，以識別及鼓勵高風險個案接受支援、即時介入自動化監測風險突然轉高的個案（例如照顧者入院）、加強醫社協作機制、開發針對性的支援計劃、優化資源分配及服務等。照顧者資料庫初步會包括來自社署、關愛隊、房屋署關於年老照顧者及低收入照顧者的資料。由於不同機構收集資料的用途未必包括為相關人士提供社福支援服務，政府正與個人資料私隱專員公署及相關部門商討如何設計數據分享方案，以便在符合《個人資料（私隱）條例》的要求下，展開相關的試點計劃。"
LCQ3: Prevention of elderly suicide,2025-06-18 12:30,2025-06-18 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800295.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Tik Chi-yuen and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

  Regarding the prevention of elderly suicide, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled detailed statistics on elderly suicide over the past five years, including but not limited to the annual number of suicide cases, the comparison of suicide rates between persons aged above 60 and other age groups, the gender, age and geographical distribution of elderly suicide victims, and the proportion of cases involving mental health issues; whether it has conducted in-depth study on the issue of elderly suicide in Hong Kong; if so, of the main triggering factors for suicide and their respective proportions, as well as the characteristics of high-risk groups; if not, the reasons for that;

(2)what specific measures are currently in place to address the mental health of the elderly and prevent suicide, particularly tailor-made support measures for high-risk elderly persons, and the allocation of resources concerned; whether it has assessed the effectiveness of such measures; if so, of the details; and

(3) given that some members of the social welfare sector have suggested that the Government should establish a ""register of high-risk singleton and doubleton elderly households"", whether the Government will consider the suggestion; if so, of the details, including the frequency of updating the register, the support provided to the elderly on the register, and whether the Government will share data with, among others, the Hospital Authority and non-governmental organisations to collaborate in supporting the elderly persons concerned?

Reply:

President,

  Elderly suicide is a multi-factorial issue with no single main cause, such as emotional problems, personal health and family relationships. In consultation with the Health Bureau, the Hospital Authority (HA), the Department of Health (DH) and the Social Welfare Department (SWD), the consolidated reply to the Member's question as follows:

  The Coroners Ordinance (Cap. 504) sets out 20 categories of deaths which should be reported to the Coroner, including suicide cases. Relevant statistics related to elderly suicide cases from 2020 to 2024 are at the Annex. Figures show that the number of suicide deaths of persons aged 60 or above has remained by and large steady in recent years, with a slight decrease in the proportion of all cases.

  While the Government has not conducted any specific study on the subject of elderly suicide in recent years, the Government all along attaches great importance to the mental health of elderly persons, and has rolled out various measures to improve the psychological health of elderly persons and prevent elderly suicide. For instance, the DH's Elderly Health Centres (EHCs) provide health assessment for their elderly members, including early detection and prevention of elderly suicide through the use of an internationally recognised screening tool for local elderly people that targets the symptoms of depression (including suicidal ideation). Healthcare professionals of the EHCs will refer cases with depression and suicidal risk to the accident and emergency departments for immediate handling.

Apart from the DH, the HA has implemented the Elderly Suicide Prevention Programme (ESPP) since 2002 to provide timely and appropriate psychiatric diagnosis and treatments for elderly people suspected to have suicidal tendency, with a view to reducing the suicidal risk of the elderly concerned. Under the ESPP, an elderly person assessed to have suicidal risk by doctors or social workers will be referred to the HA's psychiatric services for early further follow-up, diagnosis and suitable treatment.

  In addition, the HA and the SWD, through medical-social collaboration of seven HA clusters and 41 District Elderly Community Centres, implement the Dementia Community Support Scheme to enhance healthcare support at the community level. Elderly persons with mild or moderate dementia are provided with suitable support services in the community so as to stabilise their conditions and alleviate their distress in going in and out of the hospitals, and their carers also receive relevant support. The Government's ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"" offers one-stop, round-the-clock support, including immediate mental health support and referral services, for people with mental health needs (including the elderly).

  On the other hand, the SWD identifies and supports elderly persons with emotional distress and/or suicidal risks through a wide range of services. On mainstream services, there are 214 subvented elderly centres in Hong Kong providing services such as care visits, emotional support and counselling for elderly persons and their carers. The 65 Integrated Family Service Centres and two Integrated Services Centres across the territory provide preventive, supportive and remedial services to families in need. The 58 Medical Social Services Units in hospitals and clinics also offer counselling and support services, where social workers will assess the suicide risk of the service recipients when handling the cases. Besides, the SWD provides subvention to commission non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to operate 24 Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness territory-wide with one-stop, district-based community support services ranging from prevention to crisis management. In terms of specialised services, the SWD has been subventing the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong to operate the Suicide Crisis Intervention Centre, providing outreaching, crisis intervention and intensive counselling services for people with moderate or high suicide risk. Apart from the SWD's services, the NGO Suicide Prevention Services, with funding support from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, has launched the Outreach Befriending Service for the Suicidal Elderly since 2006 to early identify elderly persons suffering from emotional disturbances or with suicide risk through outreaching. Furthermore, dedicated hotline services are operated by the SWD and subvented NGOs to help persons in emotional distress (including those with suicidal tendency). Such hotline services encourage and refer the clients to relevant service units to receive in-depth counselling services that suit their needs. Among them, professional social workers of the round-the-clock Designated Hotline for Carer Support 182 183 provide immediate consultation and counselling, outreaching, emergency support and referral services, etc, for carers in need (including aged carers).

  The 2024 Policy Address announced that the Government is exploring the setting up of an inter-disciplinary and inter-organisation database on carers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities. The Government is studying the integration of data related to social welfare services scattered across different departments and organisations, with a view to building a data platform to promote inter-departmental collaboration as well as service innovation, and enhance service efficiency through sharing and analysis of data. The aim is to identify and encourage high-risk cases to receive support, intervene immediately for cases with sudden increase in risks under automatic monitoring (e.g. carers admitted to hospitals), strengthen the mechanism for medical-social collaboration, develop tailor-made support programmes, optimise allocation of resources and services, etc. The database on carers will initially include information on carers of elderly persons and low-income carers from the SWD, Care Teams and the Housing Department. As the purposes for which data are collected by different organisations may not necessarily include providing social welfare support services for the persons concerned, the Government is discussing with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data and relevant departments how to design data-sharing solutions, with a view to launching a pilot scheme in compliance with the requirements of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance."

（四）有否研究立法加強打擊利用該等數碼平台工作以獲取報酬的非法勞工？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地勞工的就業機會。從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，僱主和非法勞工以及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。《入境條例》載有不同條文針對不同人士的相關犯罪行為。訪客、非法入境者及免遣返聲請人等均不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務，協助及教唆者與非法勞工同罪。此外，政府於二○二一年修訂《入境條例》，增加了對僱主僱用非法勞工的刑罰，最高刑罰由原來的罰款35萬元和監禁三年大幅提高至罰款50萬元和監禁10年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

（二）非法勞工的情況不限於個別行業。政府一直大力打擊非法勞工，並嚴厲執法。近年市民對網上平台服務的需求有所增加（包括網上外賣及網約車服務），相關執法機關已採取相應行動以打擊非法勞工，有需要時更會展開聯合行動。就網上外賣平台方面，入境處及警務處於二○二四至二○二五年五月進行的相關執法行動中共拘捕180人，其中98名非華裔人士涉嫌非法從事外賣工作，54名本地居民涉嫌轉售或租借其外賣員平台帳戶供非法勞工使用，四人涉嫌聘用非法勞工，其餘人士因從事其他非法工作或行使虛假文書等而被捕。至於網約車方面，同期有四人涉嫌違反逗留條件而被警方拘捕。

入境處及警務處於上述行動中並無發現有集團專門透過收購香港居民的個人身分資料以註冊有關平台的工作帳戶，並以此僱用非法勞工獲利的情況。執法部門會繼續密切留意情況，不會掉以輕心。

（三）就網上外賣平台而言，入境處及警務處不時與平台公司保持溝通，並已要求平台加強戶口註冊及登錄的保安措施，包括增加驗證步驟、要求真實身分驗證等，以防止戶口持有人租借戶口予他人進行外賣工作。勞工處亦已成立包括平台公司、勞工團體及政府代表的聯絡小組，共同探討加強保障平台工作者的事宜，包括如何加強防止非法勞工從事平台送遞工作。至於網約車方面，政府一直透過不同渠道重申任何業務的營運必須守法。

（四）如前述，二○二一年修訂的《入境條例》增加了對僱主僱用非法勞工的刑罰，最高刑罰由原來的罰款35萬元和監禁三年大幅提高至罰款50萬元和監禁10年。不論是否涉及網上工作平台或其他工作模式，僱主同樣有法律責任確保僱員為合法受僱人士。政府會繼續從多方面積極打擊非法勞工，包括加強巡查及「網上巡邏」、嚴厲執法，並會加強教育宣傳，以提高市民的守法意識。

加強巡查嚴厲執法

為阻嚇僱主僱用非法勞工，勞工處的勞工督察日常巡查工作場所執行勞工法例時，會根據《入境條例》第IVB部賦予的權力，查核在工作場所內受僱僱員的身分證明文件，以及僱主備存的僱員紀錄。如發現懷疑非法受聘的勞工，會轉介相關執法部門跟進。

入境處的網絡罪案及法證調查小組，專責協助前線調查人員搜集數碼證據，加強調查案件和搜證的能力，以應對不法分子可能利用發展成熟的科技干犯入境罪行以及將來可能出現的複雜罪案。小組亦主動打擊與非法勞工有關的網絡罪案，持續進行「網上巡邏」，如發現有人利用網上社交平台或即時通訊軟件組織、安排、慫恿市民干犯聘用非法勞工等嚴重罪行，會果斷採取執法行動。

入境處及警務處會持續嚴厲打擊與非法勞工相關的罪行，並視乎行動需要、風險評估及其他考慮因素，靈活調配足夠人手，以情報主導執行打擊與非法勞工相關罪行的行動。

教育宣傳提高守法意識

為提高市民守法意識並讓僱主明白僱用非法勞工的嚴重後果，入境處不時派遣人員及宣傳車到非法勞工黑點，向僱主派發「切勿聘用非法勞工」的宣傳單張，提醒他們務必查閱求職者的香港身份證正本以核實其可否合法受僱。與此同時，入境處亦在不同社交媒體的官方帳號，積極公布最新的反非法勞工行動的執法成效並加強發放「聘用非法員工即屬違法」的信息。此外，入境處亦透過不同渠道向市民提供辨識合法受僱人士的資訊，例如入境處網頁、單張及舉辦講座等。"
LCQ10: Crackdown on illegal workers,2025-06-18 12:22,2025-06-18 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800281.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Edmund Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

It has been reported that various law enforcement agencies have recently discovered illegal workers using online car hailing or delivery platforms to work as drivers or food delivery workers, and have taken enforcement actions against them. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of illegal workers and employers of illegal workers who were prosecuted in the past three years, together with a quarterly breakdown of such figures;

(2) as it is learnt that engaging in work through digital platforms does not involve employment procedures such as job interviews, whether the authorities have assessed if the activities on such platforms are more susceptible to involving illegal workers; whether it has found any criminal syndicate specialising in acquiring the personal data of some Hong Kong residents for the purpose of registering work accounts on such platforms and subsequently making profits by employing illegal workers to provide services with these accounts; if so, of the details;

(3) whether the authorities have contacted such digital platforms to ascertain if there are loopholes in their operations from which criminal syndicates and illegal workers may benefit; if so, of the details; and

(4) whether it has studied enacting legislation to step up the crackdown on illegal workers using such digital platforms to work for reward?

Reply:

President,

The Government is committed to combatting illegal employment, with a view to protecting job opportunities for the local workforce. It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Employers, illegal workers as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance (IO). The IO has different provisions targeting relevant offences committed by different groups of persons. Visitors, illegal immigrants and non-refoulement claimants, etc, are prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Aiders and abettors as well as illegal workers are liable to the same penalties. In addition, the Government amended the IO in 2021 by increasing the penalty of employers of illegal workers, with the maximum penalty significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment with a view to reflecting the gravity of such offences. The directors, managers, secretaries, partners, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that employers of illegal workers should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

Regarding the question raised by the Hon Edmund Wong, having consulted the Labour and Welfare Bureau/Labour Department (LD), the Hong Kong Police Force (the Police) and the Immigration Department (ImmD), our reply is as follows:

(1) According to ImmD's record, the number of illegal workers prosecuted and the number of employers of illegal workers prosecuted over the past three years are tabulated below:

(2) Illegal employment is not limited to individual industries. The Government has all along combatted illegal employment and enforced the law vigorously. With an increased demand for the services provided by online platforms (including online food delivery and online car hailing) in recent years, the relevant law enforcement agencies have taken respective actions in combatting illegal employment and will conduct joint operations when necessary. Regarding the online food delivery platforms, the ImmD and the Police arrested 180 persons in relevant enforcement operations from 2024 to May 2025, 98 were non-ethnic Chinese persons suspected of working illegally as food delivery couriers, 54 were local residents suspected of selling or renting their food delivery courier accounts to the illegal workers, four were suspected of employing illegal workers and the remaining were arrested because of engaging in other illegal works or using false instruments, etc. Regarding online car hailing, four persons who were suspected of breach of condition of stay were arrested by the Police during the same period.

In the above operations, the ImmD and the Police did not identify any syndicate specialising in acquiring the personal data of Hong Kong residents for the purpose of registering work accounts on such platforms to make profits through employing illegal workers to provide services with those accounts. The law enforcement agencies will continue to closely monitor the situation and will not take this lightly.

(3) Regarding online food delivery platforms, the ImmD and the Police maintain communications with platform companies from time to time, and have already requested them to strengthen the security measures on account registration and logging in, including adding authentication steps, requesting authentication of true identity, etc, in order to prevent the account holders from renting their accounts to others for food delivery. The LD has also established a Liaison Group comprising representatives of platform companies, labour organisations and the Government to explore suitable proposals to enhance the protection for platform workers, including stepping up on prevention of illegal workers in food delivery services. Regarding online car hailing, the Government has all along emphasised through various channels that any business shall be operated in accordance with the law.

(4) As aforementioned, the IO was amended in 2021 by increasing the penalty of employers of illegal workers, with the maximum penalty significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment. Regardless of whether online working platform or other working mode is involved, employers share the same legal responsibility to ensure employees are lawfully employable persons. The Government will continue to actively combat illegal employment on various fronts, including stepping up inspections and ""cyber patrols"", taking rigourous law enforcement, and will also strengthen publicity and education, in order to raise the public's law-abiding awareness.

Stepping up inspections and rigourous law enforcement

To deter employers from employing illegal workers, labour inspectors of the LD will, through regular workplace inspections, check employees' proof of identity and employees records kept by employers under the power conferred by the Part IVB of the IO. Suspected illegal employment cases detected will be referred to relevant law enforcement agencies for follow-up.

The Cybercrime and Forensics Investigation Group (The Group) of the ImmD is dedicated to assisting frontline investigators in collecting digital evidence so as to strengthen the ability in case investigation and evidence collection, with a view to coping with criminals who may use well-developed technologies to commit immigration-related offences and some potential complicated crimes in the future. The Group has been proactively combatting cybercrimes related to illegal employment by conducting constant ""cyber patrols"". It will take resolute enforcement actions against any person who is found using social media or instant messaging software to organise, arrange or incite the public to commit serious crimes, such as illegal employment etc.

The ImmD and the Police will continue to combat illegal employment related crimes rigourously, and will, depending on operational needs, risk assessment and other considerations, flexibly arrange sufficient manpower to conduct intelligence-led enforcement operations against illegal employment related crimes.

Publicity and education to raise law-abiding awareness

In order to raise the public's law-abiding awareness and let the employers understand the serious consequences of employing illegal workers, the ImmD has deployed officers and promotional vehicles to black spots of illegal employment from time to time to distribute ""Don't Employ Illegal Workers"" leaflets to employers and remind them to inspect the original Hong Kong Identity Cards of job seekers to ascertain whether they are lawfully employable. At the same time, the ImmD has also actively published information on the effectiveness of the latest operations against illegal employment and disseminated the message of ""Employing Illegal Workers is an Offence"" through its official accounts on different social media platforms. In addition, the ImmD has provided information of identifying lawfully employable persons to the public through various channels including ImmD's website, leaflets and seminars, etc."

Announcement of sixth batch of recognised medical qualifications under Medical Registration Ordinance,2025-06-18 12:15,2025-06-18 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800207.htm,"  In accordance with the Medical Registration Ordinance (MRO), the Registrar of Medical Practitioners (i.e. the Director of Health) announced today (June 18) the sixth batch of 22 medical qualifications (see Annex 1) recognised by the Special Registration Committee (SRC). The list will be gazetted on June 20 and take effect on the same day. It will be submitted to the Legislative Council for negative vetting on June 25. Together with the first five batches of recognised medical qualifications announced, the SRC has so far recognised a total of 150 medical qualifications (see Annex 2).

  The MRO provides that non-locally trained doctors who possess recognised medical qualifications, subject to their fulfilment of certain criteria, may apply for special registration to practise in the public healthcare institutions in Hong Kong (i.e. the Hospital Authority, the Department of Health, the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong). After serving for a certain period, obtaining recognised specialist qualifications and passing the assessment, they will be granted full registration to practise in Hong Kong. For non-locally trained medical graduates who possess recognised medical qualifications but have yet to undergo an internship outside Hong Kong, subject to their fulfilment of the relevant criteria, they may take the Licensing Examination of the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) in order to apply for special registration to practise in the public healthcare institutions in Hong Kong.

立法會一題︰優化康樂及文化事務署的SmartPLAY系統,2025-06-18 12:06,2025-06-18 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800301.htm,"​以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上簡慧敏議員的提問和署理文化體育及旅遊局局長劉震的答覆︰

問題：

康樂及文化事務署（康文署）耗資五億元開發的智能康體服務預訂資訊系統SmartPLAY於二○二三年啓用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）自SmartPLAY啓用至今，政府接獲及調查了多少宗涉及租用人炒賣其租訂的設施使用時段以牟利（「炒場」）的投訴；當中按康文署罰則懲處、按法例檢控，以及被定罪的個案宗數為何；有否檢視，SmartPLAY能否有效打擊「炒場」行為，包括其抗機械人程式方案能否有效阻截以外掛程式「搶場」的行為；

（二）鑑於有市民反映，康文署場地的電子支付方式容許非租用人支付場租，令「炒場」中介可代訂場地，當局有否應對措施；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；除未成年人可由父母代訂康體設施外，有否其他可代訂的例外情況；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，目前以抽籤方式分配場地（例如草地足球場），較先到先得方式更能有效打擊「炒場」行為，當局會否研究全面以抽籤方式分配康體設施；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

康樂及文化事務署（康文署）在二○二三年十一月推出全新智能康體服務預訂資訊系統SmartPLAY，取代舊有的「康體通」電腦預訂系統。SmartPLAY系統是一體化一站式的電子服務平台，旨在方便市民透過互聯網或流動應用程式，查詢和預訂康文署的康體設施，以及報名參加各類康體活動或比賽。現時，SmartPLAY系統的登記用戶達107萬，每日完成的預訂記錄平均達28 000項。

就簡慧敏議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）康文署一直十分關注康體場地的違規轉讓或炒賣情況，以多管齊下方式打擊「炒場」活動，包括持續透過優化訂場制度、設立懲罰安排、和加強巡查。現時，SmartPLAY系統阻止「炒場」的功能包括：

（i） 採用實名登記；
（ii）在先到先得的分配機制上，加入以抽籤方式分配熱門康體設施；
（iii）要求租用人在SmartPLAY系統訂場及簽場時，須聲明承諾將在場地內使用有關設施，並不得以任何形式轉讓用場許可證。違者或觸犯《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）下的欺詐罪，一經定罪，最高可被判監禁14年；以及
（iv）加入限制，讓租訂收費或免費康樂設施的時間均不能重疊。

除了優化SmartPLAY系統外，康文署密切留意有關「炒場」的資訊，並不時巡查場地，包括進行突擊巡察，要求租用人出示身份證明文件，以便在需要時即時作出調查和跟進。若租用人未在場地使用設施，將被視為一次違規。如在60日內累積兩次違規紀錄，將禁止有關租用人預訂康文署的收費康體設施90日。自SmartPLAY系統啓用至二○二五年五月，康文署已進行超過89萬次抽樣巡查，當中超過13 000名租用人因違規而受到懲處，即90日內不能預訂康文署的收費康體設施。在二○二三年十一月至今年五月期間，康文署共接獲435宗與「炒場」相關的投訴。經調查後，康文署對50宗違規個案作出懲處。康文署會繼續監察情況，並會考慮對重複違規人士加重罰則。

此外，康文署聯同執法部門於二○二四年七月在灣仔區內的網球場展開聯合行動，打擊「炒場」及其他違法行為，並成功拘捕數名涉案人士。其中部分人士已被起訴定罪，分別被判入獄6個月及4個月，其餘案件仍在審訊或處理中。

為有效打擊濫用電腦程式租用康樂場地，SmartPLAY系統已引入新一代的網上應用系統防火牆及抗機械人技術，密切監測用戶登入情況，並採用人工智能監察用戶行為及網絡使用情況，進行自動防衛，以確保系統運作暢順。當人工智能判斷出異常操作（例如發現有不尋常的登入情況）時，系統將自動攔截。此外，康文署與承辦商一直密切監察系統運作，並不時調整系統設定。二○二五年年初，系統在繁忙時段曾攔截超過500萬個可疑程式的登入請求。康文署和承辦商將持續跟進，積極研究更多防範機械人程式預訂康樂場地的方案，以提升正常用戶的預訂體驗。

（二）SmartPLAY系統是一個需實名登記的一站式的電子服務平台，讓市民隨時通過互聯網或流動應用程式查詢和預訂康文署的康體設施，並使用電子支付訂場。由於個別用戶可能因不同情況（例如缺乏電子支付工具或餘額不足）在預訂時無法使用電子支付，因此需要他人協助，使用非租用人名下的支付方式付款完成預訂。此外，未成年（18歲以下）用戶的父母也可能需要協助，代為處理子女的帳戶預訂及付款。因此，SmartPLAY系統並不要求租用人與支付人必須為同一人，但系統是實名登記，租用人必須親身簽場，並在場使用設施。

（三）現時，康文署採用兩種方式（即先到先得方式和抽籤方式）分配其康樂設施。為方便市民規劃其運動的時間，SmartPLAY系統允許使用者以先到先得方式，在用場前7日內預訂或即場租用大部分康體設施。至於抽籤方式，雖具公平性，但需使用者提前規劃，以便在用場前14至20日內提交抽籤申請。使用者亦須留意抽籤結果和付款期限。由於兩種分配方法各有利弊，康文署曾進行問卷調查，蒐集市民對預訂和分配轄下各康體設施機制的意見。

經考慮不同設施使用者的意見，謹慎審視實際使用情況後，康文署目前只採用抽籤方式分配熱門的草地足球場，其他康體設施則沿用先到先得方式。康文署會繼續密切留意轄下各設施的使用情況，在鼓勵恆常運動的目標下，檢討相關的預訂安排。

多謝主席。"
LCQ1: Enhancing Leisure and Cultural Services Department's SmartPLAY system,2025-06-18 12:06,2025-06-18 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800305.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Carmen Kan and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD)'s intelligent sports and recreation services booking and information system, SmartPLAY, which was developed at a cost of $500 million, was launched in 2023. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of complaints it has received and investigated since the launch of SmartPLAY in relation to hirers profiting from touting their booked sessions for use of recreation and sports facilities (touting activities); among these cases, of the respective numbers of those being punished according to the LCSD's penalties, prosecuted according to the law, and convicted; whether it has examined the effectiveness of SmartPLAY in combating touting activities, including whether its anti-bot solution can effectively block plug-in programmes from snatching up booking sessions;

(2) as some members of the public have reflected that the e-payment method for the LCSD venues allows non-hirers to pay venue hire charges, making it possible for touting agents to book the venues on others' behalf, whether there are any countermeasures in place; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; apart from the fact that minors may have their parents book recreation and sports facilities on their behalf, whether there are any other exceptional circumstances where third-party bookings are permitted; and

(3) as there are views that the current approach to allocation of venues (e.g. grass soccer pitches) by ballot is more effective than the first-come, first-served approach in combating touting activities, whether the authorities will consider allocating all recreational and sports facilities by ballot; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) launched a brand new intelligent sports and recreation services booking information system named SmartPLAY in November 2023 to replace the old Leisure Link Computer Booking System. The SmartPLAY system is an integrated one-stop electronic service platform designed to facilitate the public in searching for and booking the sports and recreation facilities of the LCSD, as well as enrolling in various kinds of sports and recreation activities or competitions through the internet or mobile application. At present, the SmartPLAY system has 1.07 million registered users with 28 000 daily booking transactions on average.

My reply to the the Hon Carmen Kan's question is set out below:

(1) The LCSD has always paid close attention to unauthorised transfer or touting activities in relation to sports and recreation facilities, and adopted a multi-pronged approach to combat touting activities, including enhancing the booking system on an ongoing basis, imposing penalty arrangements, and stepping up inspections. At present, the SmartPLAY system includes the following functions to combat touting activities:

(i) adopting real-name registration;
(ii) allocating popular sports and recreation facilities by ballot in addition to the first-come, first-served allocation mechanism;
(iii) requiring hirers to declare and undertake that they will be present during the use of relevant facilities and that the user permit will not be transferred by any means when booking and signing for facilities via the SmartPLAY system. Offenders may have committed an offence of fraud under the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) and be liable to imprisonment of up to 14 years upon conviction; and
(iv) imposing restrictions to prohibit the booking of overlapping sessions of fee-charging or non-fee charging sports and recreation facilities.

In addition to enhancing the SmartPLAY system, the LCSD closely monitors information on touting and inspects venues from time to time, including conducting surprise inspections and requiring hirers to present identification documents to facilitate investigation and follow-up immediately as necessary. If a hirer is not present during the booked session, it will be counted as a breach. A hirer who has accumulated two breaches within 60 days will result in a 90-day ban on booking fee-charging sports and recreation facilities under the LCSD. Since the commissioning of the SmartPLAY system until May 2025, the LCSD has conducted over 890 000 random inspections, with more than 13 000 hirers being penalised for breaches, i.e. being suspended from booking the LCSD fee-charging sports and recreation facilities for 90 days. From November 2023 to May this year, the LCSD received a total of 435 complaints relating to touting activities. Upon investigation, the LCSD imposed penalties for 50 cases of breaches. The LCSD will continue to monitor the situation and consider imposing heavier penalties on repeated offenders.

Furthermore, the LCSD launched a joint operation with law enforcement agencies in July 2024 at tennis courts in Wan Chai District to combat touting and other illegal activities. Several individuals were arrested successfully. Some of the individuals had been prosecuted and convicted, and were sentenced to imprisonment of four months and six months respectively. Other cases are still under trial or being processed.

To effectively combat the abuse of computer programmes for booking sports and recreation facilities, a new generation of Web Application Firewall and anti-bot technology have been introduced in the SmartPLAY system to closely monitor users' log-in activities. SmartPLAY also employs artificial intelligence (AI) to oversee users' behaviour and network usage for auto-defence, ensuring smooth operation of the system. When AI detects any abnormal operation (such as unusual log-in), the system will automatically intercept suspicious access. Moreover, the LCSD, in collaboration with the contractor, has been closely monitoring the operation of the system and adjusting its settings from time to time. More than five million log-in attempts by suspected bots were intercepted by the system during peak periods in early 2025. The LCSD and the contractor will continue to follow up and actively explore more solutions to prevent bot booking of sports and recreation facilities, thereby enhancing the booking experience of normal users.

(2) SmartPLAY is a one-stop electronic service platform that requires real-name registration. It enables the public to enquire about the sports and recreation facilities of the LCSD and make bookings anytime via the internet or mobile application with e-payment options. Owing to various circumstances (such as a lack of electronic payment tools or insufficient balances therein), individual users may not be able to use e-payment when booking facilities and require the assistance of others who are not hirers to make the payment and complete the process. Besides, parents of minors (aged under 18) may need to help manage their children's accounts for booking and payment. Therefore, the SmartPLAY system does not require the hirer and the payer to be the same person. That said, real-name registration of the hirer is required and the hirer must personally check in and be present to use the facilities.

(3) Currently, the LCSD allocates its sports and recreation facilities using two methods, namely on a first-come, first-served basis and balloting. To facilitate members of the public in planning their exercise schedule, the SmartPLAY system allows users to make seven-day advance bookings or on-the-spot hires of most of the sports and recreation facilities on a first-come, first-served basis. As for balloting, although it is a fair mechanism, it requires users to make advance planning by submitting balloting applications within 14 to 20 days before the usage date. Applicants must also pay attention to the balloting results and payment deadlines. Since both allocation methods have their own merits and drawbacks, the LCSD has conducted a questionnaire survey to collect public views on the mechanisms for booking and allocating various sports and recreation facilities under its purview.

After considering the feedback from different users as well as reviewing the actual usage carefully, the LCSD currently only allocates sessions of popular turf soccer pitches by balloting, while other sports and recreation facilities continue to be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. The LCSD will continue to pay close attention to the usage of its various facilities and review relevant booking arrangements with a view to encouraging the general public to engage in regular exercise.

Thank you, President."
LCQ20: Carbon emission reduction,2025-06-18 12:00,2025-06-18 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800243.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Adrian Ho and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

In October 2021, the Government announced Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, which aims to reduce Hong Kong's carbon emissions by half from the 2005 level before 2035 and outlines four major decarbonisation strategies, namely net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will duly adjust its green policies in response to Hong Kong's actual carbon emissions in recent years to accelerate the overall pace of decarbonisation in Hong Kong and thus achieve its carbon reduction targets as scheduled;

(2) of the respective performances of various government departments over the past five years in key carbon reduction measures, such as energy saving, emission reduction, consumption and carbon emission reduction, as well as green procurement; whether government departments have set carbon reduction targets and timetables for the series of policy measures implemented in recent years, including the establishment of the Green Technology and Finance Development Committee and the implementation of the Uncertificated Securities Market initiative;

(3) as there are views that the broad participation of businesses in decarbonisation efforts is vital for Hong Kong to achieve carbon neutrality, how many businesses and organisations have, as of May this year, joined the ""Green Hong Kongï¼Carbon Audit"" campaign by signing the Carbon Reduction Charter and agreeing to undertake and implement activities in support of reducing greenhouse gas emissions; whether it has assessed the effectiveness of the participating businesses and organisations in formulating and implementing carbon reduction measures;

(4) as it is learnt that the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited established the Hong Kong International Carbon Market Council and subsequently launched an international carbon marketplace ""Core Climate"" in 2022, whether Government is aware of the current operational status of both the Council and Core Climate, as well as their respective effectiveness in promoting the implementation of decarbonisation measures among businesses in Hong Kong; and

(5) given that green transport is one of the Government's decarbonisation strategies, which includes achieving zero vehicular emissions and zero carbon emissions in the transport sector before 2050 through promoting the electrification of vehicles, and ceasing new registrations of fuel-propelled and hybrid private cars in or before 2035, whether the Government has assessed if the current progress of such efforts will enable the carbon reduction targets to be achieved on schedule?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the reply to the question raised by the Hon Adrian Ho is as follows:

(1) The Government has proposed four major decarbonisation strategies in the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, namely net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction, to lead Hong Kong to halve its carbon emissions from the 2005 level by 2035, with a view to achieving carbon neutrality before 2050. With our efforts in recent years in these four decarbonisation strategies, Hong Kong is making steady progress towards the carbon reduction target of 2035.

Hong Kong's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been on a downward trend after reaching its peak in 2014. With the gradual replacement of coal-fired power generation by natural gas and zero-carbon energy, the popularisation of electric vehicles, the reduction of municipal solid waste disposal, and the increased recovery and use of landfill gas for energy generation in Hong Kong, the total GHG emissions in 2023 were reduced by about 20 per cent from the 2005 level and about a quarter from the peak in 2014. The per capita GHG emissions in 2023 was 4.58 tonnes, which is a new low since 1990. It is nearly 30 per cent lower than those in 2005 and 2014, and is about a quarter of that of the United States and 60 per cent of that of the European Union.

Combating climate change is a long-term task. In line with the spirit of the Paris Agreement, we will review the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050 about every five years to update the strategies and targets for decarbonisation and other climate actions, and expect to release the review result in 2026.

(2) To enhance the performance of government departments in energy conservation and carbon emissions, the Government has promulgated relevant internal circulars and guidelines to require departments to perform well in the area of environmental protection in their daily operations. Specific measures include energy conservation, adoption of renewable energy (RE), waste reduction and recycling, installation of electric vehicle charging facilities, water conservation and recycling, procurement of green products and services, etc. with a view to reducing carbon emissions. These government circulars and guidelines cover environmental targets for government buildings, carbon emission management, preparation of environmental reports by government departments, as well as green procurement, etc.

The Government strives to improve the overall energy performance of government buildings and infrastructure by more than 6 per cent in 2024-25, compared to the 2018-19 baseline. To this end, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has requested all bureaux and departments (B/Ds) to provide information on the energy consumption and RE of government buildings and facilities annually, and organised briefing sessions to discuss energy performance, and provides technical advice on energy-saving measures and planning of RE projects. As at 2022-23, the Government's overall energy performance has improved by about 5.3 per cent. While the data for 2023-24 is still being compiled, based on the recent trends in energy performance, the Government is confident that the target of over 6 per cent improvement can be achieved. The Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) will continue to encourage all B/Ds to take measures to enhance energy performance and explore means to leverage innovative technologies to promote cost-effective solutions for improving energy efficiency in government buildings.

To assist government B/Ds in setting emission reduction targets and implementing emission reduction measures in a more scientific way, the Government promulgated the ""Carbon Management in Government Buildings"" circular in 2017 which requires all major government buildings to conduct regular carbon audits, the results of which should be disclosed to the public through the publication of annual environmental performance reports or other means.

Furthermore, the Government has conducted a three-year (from 2020-21 to 2022-23) energy-cum-carbon audit in about 250 government buildings, to review systematically the energy consumption equipment and systems in these buildings, collect and compile activity data on relevant emission sources to identify energy and carbon management opportunities. To further enhance the Government's carbon management efforts, we progressively extend the carbon audit practice to typical major government infrastructure, including water treatment works, sewage treatment facilities, fresh water and salt water pumping facilities, road lighting systems and ventilation systems at public transport interchanges, etc. The results of the carbon audits will not only help relevant B/Ds formulate carbon reduction strategies for the above infrastructure and similar facilities, but will also assist them in establishing a mechanism and guidelines for conducting carbon audits, which will in turn facilitate the carbon management efforts for other infrastructure in the future. The Buildings Energy Efficiency (Amendment) Bill 2025 was passed by the Legislative Council on June 11 and will come into full effect in September 2026. By then, most government buildings will be statutorily required to conduct regular energy audits. The EEB and the EMSD will provide technical support to various B/Ds to assist and encourage them to implement energy-saving opportunities identified in energy audits.

The Government has been adopting green procurement to implement environmental protection. The EEB has developed a green procurement list, setting out green specifications for the products and services commonly used by the Government, so that B/Ds may practise green procurement. In July 2021, the Government expanded the scope of green procurement by increasing the number of products and services covered in the green procurement list from 150 items to 183 items, as well as updating the green specifications of each item. In 2024, B/Ds altogether procured green products and services with a total value of $8.42 billion, which is an increase of about 19.3 per cent as compared to $7.06 billion in 2023.

The Green Technology and Finance Development Committee (Committee) was established in June 2023 under the chairmanship of the Financial Secretary to assist in the formation of an action agenda for promoting the development of Hong Kong into an international green technology and financial centre. Members include representatives from relevant policy bureaux, departments and financial regulators, as well as non-official members from finance, technology, academic, professional services sectors, etc. The Committee's discussions cover promoting the development of a green technology ecosystem, green finance, green transport, green buildings, etc., as well as promoting and publicising Hong Kong's strengths in these areas. The Committee will continue to explore accelerating the development of green technology and green finance in Hong Kong across various areas.

In April this year, the Government implemented new arrangements to allow companies to adopt implied consent mechanism for disseminating corporate communication by publication on their websites, in order to promote paperless corporate communication for listed and unlisted Hong Kong companies, thereby improving cost-effectiveness and efficiency of companies and promoting a green business environment.

(3) The Government launched the ""Green Hong Kongï¼Carbon Audit"" campaign with a view to encouraging organisations of various sectors to support greenhouse gas emission reduction activities. The participating organisations would, according to their respective situations, formulate and implement carbon reduction measures such as promoting carbon audits, establishing environmental management systems, and installing and replacing energy-efficient office equipment. Currently, over 140 organisations, including property management companies, universities, professional bodies, non-profit-making organisations and other business organisations, have joined the ""Green Hong Kongï¼Carbon Audit"" campaign. In addition to raising the awareness of participating organisations in carbon reduction and encouraging these organisations to conduct carbon audits and implement carbon reduction plans, the campaign also helps corporates prepare for addressing new climate-related disclosure requirements.

The Government launched in December last year the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong (Roadmap), injecting new impetus into the carbon management work of large publicly accountable entities (PAEs) (including large listed issuers and non-listed financial institutions carrying a significant weight). As the first step, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has introduced new climate-related disclosures requirements (New Climate Requirements) which have been developed based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S2 Climate-related Disclosures. The New Climate Requirements, covering, among others, mandating all listed issuers to disclose scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions, have been implemented in phases starting from January 2025.

To assist and facilitate sustainability reporting by corporates and financial institutions in Hong Kong, the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (Steering Group), formed by relevant Government bureaux, financial regulators and HKEX, launched the ""Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire"" for non-listed companies/ small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and GHG emissions calculation and estimation tools in collaboration with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Available for free public access on the Steering Group's website, these tools help SMEs manage their environmental footprint and encourage market participants to improve sustainable business practices.

(4) HKEX launched the Hong Kong International Carbon Market Council (the Council) in July 2022, with members comprising Mainland, Hong Kong, and international corporates and financial institutions, to facilitate the development of an efficient and effective Hong Kong-based international carbon market with best-in-class market infrastructure, products and services, promoting the transition to a low-carbon economy in the region.

Subsequently, HKEX launched the Core Climate, an international carbon marketplace, in October in the same year, facilitating effective and transparent trading of carbon credits and instruments to support the global transition to Net Zero. It offers quality carbon credits from internationally-certified projects in Asia, South America and Africa, covering forestry, solar, wind and biomass initiatives. Core Climate is currently the only carbon marketplace that offers HKD and RMB settlement for the trading of international voluntary carbon credits. The platform's participant number reached 100 by end of 2024. Core Climate has facilitated carbon credit trading by various corporates through the provision of trustworthy settlement services, enhancing efficiency and mitigating risks, including Cathay Pacific Airways Limited's settlement of 50 000 tonnes of voluntary carbon credits in December last year, fully demonstrating the important role of Core Climate in supporting corporates on their climate transition journey.

The Government will continue to work closely with the financial regulators and stakeholders to collaboratively enhance the carbon market ecosystem, expand related products and services, and optimise trading mechanisms and infrastructure to promote the orderly and healthy development of the carbon market, contributing to the decarbonisation targets of Hong Kong, our country, as well as the world.

(5) The Government is committed to promoting the use of electric vehicles (EV). The Hong Kong Roadmap on Popularisation of Electric Vehicles announced in March 2021 covers policy directions and targets in various areas in promoting the adoption of new energy transport technologies, so as to guide Hong Kong towards zero vehicular emissions before 2050. In recent years, Hong Kong has achieved remarkable results in the popularisation of EV. The number of EV was eightfold from about 14 000 five years ago to about 110 000 at the end of last year. Currently, about seven out of every ten newly registered private cars are electric private cars (e-PC), and the proportion is among the highest in the world, with a good growth momentum.

Charging network is critical to the popularisation of EV. As of March 2025, Hong Kong had nearly 100000 parking spaces equipped with charging infrastructure. There are 11180 public charging facilities, of which about 2000 are quick or fast charging facilities. We will continue to adopt a multi-pronged approach to increase charging facilities, including (i) tightening the exemption measure for calculating the gross floor area of buildings to encourage parking spaces in new private buildings to be equipped with charging infrastructure; and (ii) launching the $3.5 billion ""EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme"" to assist existing private residential buildings and housing estate car parks to install EV charging infrastructure. It is estimated that by mid-2027, more than200 000 parking spaces in private buildings will be equipped with charging infrastructure.

In terms of public charging facilities, the Government's Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis published at the end of last year listed a number of measures to continue to expand the public charging network, including converting petrol filling stations into fast charging stations or adding fast chargers, and opening up chargers in bus depots, etc. The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address also announced the launch of a $300 million incentive scheme, with the target to provide and put into service 3 000 fast chargers from 2026 to the end of 2028 to support about 160000 EV. It is expected that the incentive scheme will be launched and start to receive applications in the coming one to two months.

Furthermore, EEB has set up an interdepartmental working group to coordinate and resolve difficulties encountered by various parties in setting up charging facilities.

Through the above measures, we are confident that Hong Kong's increasingly complete charging network will further promote vehicle electrification and ultimately achieve the relevant carbon reduction goals."

答覆：

主席:

就何敬康議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局後，現回覆如下：

（一） 特區政府在《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》（《藍圖》）中提出「淨零發電」、「節能綠建」、「綠色運輸」和「全民減廢」四大減碳策略，帶領香港在二○三五年前把碳排放量從二○○五年的水平減半，以邁向二○五○年前實現碳中和的目標。隨著我們致力落實四大減碳策略，香港正穩步邁向二○三五年的減碳目標。

香港溫室氣體排放總量自二○一四年達峰後繼續呈下降趨勢。隨着香港逐步以天然氣和零碳能源取代燃煤發電、電動車普及化、減少都市固體廢物棄置量、以及增加堆填氣體回收及使用量以生產能源，二○二三年的溫室氣體排放總量比二○○五年的水平下降約百分之二十，與二○一四年排放峰值比較已下降約四分之一；二○二三年的人均溫室氣體排放量為4.58公噸，是自一九九○年的新低，比二○○五年及二○一四年均下降近三成，約是美國的四分之一及歐盟的六成。

應對氣候變化是一項長遠工作。我們會按《巴黎協定》精神，約每五年檢視《藍圖》，更新減碳和其他應對氣候變化的策略及目標，並預計於二○二六年發布檢視結果。

（二） 為加強政府部門的節能減排表現，政府內部有相關通告和指引，要求部門在日常運作中做好環保工作。具體內容包括節約能源、加強可再生能源使用、減廢回收、安裝電動車充電設施、節約用水及再用、採購環保產品和服務等措施以減低碳排放等。這些政府通告及指引涵蓋政府建築物的環保目標、碳排放管理、政府部門環保報告的制訂、以及環保採購等。

政府爭取在二○二四至二五年度將政府建築物和基建設施的整體能源表現提升超過百分之六（與二○一八至一九基準年相比）。機電工程署（機電署）每年要求各決策局和部門提供政府建築物和設施的能源消耗和可再生能源資料並舉辦簡報會與各決策局和部門就能源表現進行討論，以及為節能措施和可再生能源項目的規劃提供技術意見。截至二○二二至二三年度，政府的整體能源表現已提升約百分之五點三。雖然二○二三至二四年度的數據仍在編制中，但參考近年能源表現趨勢，我們有信心可以達到提升超過百分之六的目標。環境及生態局會繼續鼓勵各決策局及部門採取措施提升能源表現，並探討如何善用創新科技，以更具成本效益的方案推動政府建築物提升能源效益。

為協助政府決策局及部門以科學化的方式制定減排目標和推行減排措施，政府於二○一七年發布「政府建築物碳管理」通告，要求所有主要政府建築物需定期進行碳審計，並透過年度環保工作報告或以其他方式向公眾披露碳審計的結果。

此外，政府已為約250座政府建築物進行為期三年（即二○二○至二一至二○二二至二三年度）的能源暨碳排放審計，有系統地檢視建築物的能源消耗設備和系統，收集及整理相關排放源的活動數據，以找出能源管理和碳管理機會。為進一步加強政府的碳管理工作，我們把碳審計措施逐步由政府建築物推廣至具代表性的主要政府基建設施，包括濾水廠、污水處理設施、食水及海水抽水設施、道路照明設施和公共運輸交匯處的抽風系統等。碳審計的結果不但有助相關決策局及部門為這些設施以至同類型設施制定減碳策略，更可協助部門建立進行碳審計的機制和指引，方便日後為其他基建設施進行碳管理。《2025年建築物能源效益（修訂）條例草案》已在六月十一日獲立法會通過，並將在二○二六年九月全面生效。屆時，大部份政府建築物均須按法例要求定期進行能源審核。環境及生態局和機電署會向各政策局和部門提供技術支援，協助和鼓勵各部門落實在能源審核中辨識的節能機會。

政府一向實行環保採購，以落實環保理念。環境及生態局就政府經常使用的產品和服務制訂環保採購清單，當中羅列各項產品和服務的環保規格，以供政策局和部門進行環保採購。政府已於二○二一年七月擴大環保採購，把環保採購清單上所涵蓋的產品和服務由150種增加至183種，同時更新各項目的環保規格。決策局和部門於二○二四年合共採購總值84.2億元的環保產品和服務，較二○二三年的70.6億元增加約百分之十九點三。

由財政司司長擔任主席的綠色科技及金融發展委員會（委員會）於二○二三年六月成立，協助制訂行動綱領，推動香港發展為國際綠色科技及綠色金融中心。成員包括有關政策局、政府部門和金融監管機構的代表，以及來自金融、科技、學術、專業服務等界別的非官方成員。委員會討論的範疇涵蓋推動建設綠色科技生態圈、發展綠色金融、綠色運輸和綠色建築等，以及推廣和宣傳香港在相關方面的優勢。委員會會繼續就各個領域持續探討加速香港綠色科技和綠色金融的發展。

今年四月，政府實施新安排，容許公司採用默示同意機制透過網站向股東發布通訊，以推動本地上市及非上市公司以無紙化方式作出公司通訊，有助提升公司的成本效益和營運效率，並達致環保營商的目的。

（三） 政府推行「綠色香港․碳審計」活動，目的是鼓勵各界機構進行支持減低溫室氣體排放的活動。參與機構會按各自的情況，以不同的方式制訂及實行減碳措施包括推動碳審計，成立環境管理系統，以及安裝、更換節能辦公設備。現時有超過140個機構，包括物業管理公司、大學、專業團體、非牟利組織和其他商業界別的團體參加「綠色香港․碳審計」 。該活動除了提高參與機構的減碳意識，鼓勵機構進行碳審計及執行減碳計劃，亦可協助企業為應對有關氣候相關披露的新規定做好準備。

政府於去年十二月推出《香港可持續披露路線圖》，為大型公眾責任實體（包括大型上市發行人和具有重要影響力的非上市金融機構）的碳管理工作注入新動力。作為第一步，香港交易及結算所有限公司 （港交所）已引入依據《國際財務報告可持續披露準則第2號—氣候相關披露》所制定的新氣候信息披露規定，包括要求所有上市發行人均須強制披露範圍一及範圍二溫室氣體排放，新要求已於二○二五年一月起分階段實施。

為協助和便利香港企業和金融機構作可持續匯報，由相關政府政策局、金融監管機構及港交所組成的綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組）分別推出了針對非上市公司／中小企業的「氣候和環境風險問卷」；以及與香港科技大學合作推出溫室氣體排放計算和估算工具，並在督導小組網站上免費開放予公眾使用。這些工具有助中小企業管理其環保足跡，促進市場參與者改善可持續發展的作業模式。

（四） 港交所於二○二二年七月成立香港國際碳市場委員會，成員包括內地、香港及國際多家領先企業及金融機構，協助香港建設高效率的國際碳市場，提供優越的市場基礎設施、產品和服務，促進區內向低碳經濟轉型。

港交所其後於同年十月推出國際碳市場Core Climate，支持市場進行高效和透明的碳信用產品和工具的交易，協助推動全球淨零轉型。Core Climate平台上交易的優質碳信用源自經國際認證的碳減排項目，包括亞洲、南美及非洲的林業、太陽能、風能及生物質能等項目。Core Climate是目前唯一為國際自願碳信用產品交易同時提供港元及人民幣結算的碳市場。參與者數目至去年底達100個。Core Climate至今已為不少企業進行碳信用交易提供可靠的結算服務、提高交易效率及降低結算風險，當中包括去年十二月國泰航空有限公司透過Core Climate結算50 000噸自願減排量，充分顯示了Core Climate在支援企業氣候轉型過程中扮演的重要角色。

政府將繼續與金融監管機構及持份者緊密合作，共同完善碳市場生態圈、拓展相關產品服務及優化交易機制和基礎設施，促進碳市場有序健康發展，為香港、國家乃至世界的減碳目標作出貢獻。

（五） 政府致力推廣使用電動車。二○二一年三月公布的《香港電動車普及化路線圖》，涵蓋各方面推動使用新能源運輸技術的政策方向和目標，引領香港在二○五○年前達到車輛零排放。近年香港在電動車普及化方面已取得顯著成果，電動車數量由五年前約一萬四千輛擴大八倍至去年底的約11萬輛。現時每10輛新登記私家車，有約七輛是電動私家車，比例位處世界前列，增長勢頭良好。

充電網絡對推動電動車普及化非常重要。截至二○二五年三月，香港已經有近10萬個停車位備有充電基礎設施。公共充電設施則有11 180個，當中約2 000個是快速或高速充電設施。我們將繼續多管齊下增加充電設施，包括透過（一）收緊豁免計算樓宇總樓面面積的措施，鼓勵新建私人樓宇停車位配備充電基礎設施；以及（二）推行35億元的「EV屋苑充電易資助計劃」，協助現有私人住宅樓宇及屋苑停車場內的停車位安裝電動車充電基礎設施。估計在二○二七年年中前將有超過20萬個私人樓宇停車位配備充電基礎設施。

公共充電設施方面，政府在去年年底公布的《公共巴士和的士綠色轉型路線圖》羅列了多項措施，持續擴展公共充電網絡，包括將加油站改建為高速充電站或加裝高速充電樁，及開放巴士車廠的充電樁等。《行政長官2024年施政報告》亦宣布推出三億元鼓勵計劃，目標是由二○二六年至二○二八年年底提供3 000支高速充電樁並投入服務，以額外支援約16萬輛電動車。預計鼓勵計劃會於未來一兩個月內推出並開始接受申請。

此外，環境及生態局已成立了跨部門工作小組，盡力協調解決各方在設立充電設施時遇到的困難。

透過上述多項措施，我們有信心本港日趨完備的充電網絡會進一步推動車輛電動化，最終達致相關減碳目標。"
LCQ9: Holding of large-scale concerts,2025-06-18 11:32,2025-06-18 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800255.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Kennedy Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

It is learnt that a number of large-scale concerts have been held recently at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), the AsiaWorld-Expo, the Hong Kong Coliseum and the Queen Elizabeth Stadium respectively, attracting tens of thousands of local and overseas ""fans"", and large-scale music events will also be held at the KTSP's Main Stadium one after another. Some commercial tenants in Kai Tak have pointed out that their sales volume surged by three times on the days of the aforesaid concerts, while the business of some catering establishments in Kowloon City District also increased by more than 30 per cent. On the other hand, there were cases in which a large number of Mainland fans had to wait for a long time before they could cross the border via the Huanggang Port after the aforesaid concerts. In this connection, will the authorities concerned inform this Council:

(1) in view of the successive holding of large-scale music events and concerts as mega events, whether the Government has established a regular inter-departmental collaboration mechanism to assess and make preparations before the holding of each of the large-scale activities concerned, as well as to make a summary afterwards and announce the situation in a timely manner; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) given that large-scale concerts were held at the AsiaWorld-Expo and various sports venues before and after the opening of the KTSP, whether the Government has compiled statistics on the attendances of such concerts and, among them, the respective ratios of local, overseas and Mainland audiences; and

(3) whether the Government has assessed the economic benefits in promoting the growth of the hotel, catering, retail and transportation industries, etc, as well as creating job opportunities and so on during the aforesaid large-scale concerts; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Pop concerts brings substantial economic benefits and employment opportunities, creates a positive atmosphere in society and stimulates local consumption. The Government welcomes commercial organisations to hold concerts of singers and groups of Hong Kong and other places in the city. With its official commissioning in March, the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) provides Hong Kong with the largest and state-of-the-art venues, and quickly becomes a new hub for hosting major international sports and entertainment events.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Security Bureau, my reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Kennedy Wong is as follows:

(1) To offer a pleasant experience to residents and tourists participating in large-scale pop concerts, relevant departments and organisations, for example the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Transport Department (TD), event organisers, venue management, public transport operators, maintains close liaison to discuss the detailed arrangements for every large-scale pop concert. Those arrangements include conducting risk assessments, deploying manpower, formulating and implementing comprehensive plans for crowd control, information dissemination, traffic diversion and control point arrangements, with a view to ensuring that the events will take place in a safe and orderly manner with well-prepared contingency plans for any unforeseen circumstances.

For the KTSP, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau monitors and guides the Kai Tak Sports Park Limited (the operator) in the communication and collaboration with various government departments, event organisers, and public transport providers to implement different preparatory work. Based on factors such as the number of attendees, the nature, ending times, and ticketing situations of the concerts, we make corresponding arrangements as needed, such as arranging special bus routes, increasing frequency of the Mass Transit Railway services, and notifying border control points. The operator also issues press releases and publicises the latest event arrangements and venue rules on social media prior to large-scale pop concerts. After the concerts conclude, relevant departments and the operator consolidate their experience with a view to further optimising the operation of events and concerts in the future.

To facilitate the flow of passengers travelling through various boundary control points (BCPs) after large-scale events, relevant departments closely monitor the real-time situation of BCPs, make flexible deployment of manpower and operate additional counters and channels as necessary with a view to facilitating passenger and vehicular movements. Relevant departments also maintain close liaison with their Mainland counterparts to ensure smooth operations at BCPs.

Taking the traffic arrangements after the three concerts held at the KTSP, the AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE) and the Hong Kong Coliseum (HKC) on the evening of May 24 this year as an example, as it was expected that a considerable number of passengers would return to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Control Point after the concerts, the TD co-ordinated with the operators of cross-boundary coaches and Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) in advance to increase the frequency of services to divert passengers. For the traffic arrangements at the KTSP, the number of cross-boundary coaches in service that night was double that of normal days, and about 3 300 passengers who had purchased tickets in advance were diverted within one hour after the concert ended; and after increasing the frequency of the Yellow Bus, it basically completed the transportation of all passengers from San Tin Terminus to Lok Ma Chau Control Point within one hour (from 00.00 to around 01.00).

(2) and (3) According to our estimates, more than 285 performance sessions of pop concerts with over 10 000 spectators would be held throughout 2024 and first half of 2025. As a ballpark, these concerts would attract over 3.9 million spectators, including over 1.4 million tourists, whose spending is estimated to be about HK$3.4 billion, bringing a value add of about HK$1.9 billion to the Hong Kong economy.

In 2024 and 2025 (as at May 31), the attendances of all pop concerts at the Kai Tak Stadium and the Kai Tak Arena, the AWE, the HKC and the Queen Elizabeth Stadium (QES) are set out below:

Since the official commissioning of the KTSP, various renowned international and Asian bands and singers have staged a total of 15 large-scale concerts at the Kai Tak Stadium and the Kai Tak Arena, with more than half of the spectators coming from the Mainland and overseas. For pop concerts at the AWE, spectators from the Mainland and overseas take up over 30 per cent of the attendances."
立法會九題：舉行大型演唱會,2025-06-18 11:32,2025-06-18 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800252.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上黃英豪議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉，近期有多場大型演唱會分別在啟德體育園（體育園）、亞洲國際博覽館、香港體育館和伊利沙伯體育館舉行，吸引數以萬計海內外「粉絲」捧場，而體育園主場館也將陸續舉行大型音樂活動。有部分啟德商户指出，其銷售額在上述演唱會舉行當天激增三倍，而九龍城區部分餐飲場所的生意亦增長30%以上。另一方面，上述演唱會完場後亦曾發生大批內地歌迷需長時間才能經皇崗口岸過關的情況。就此，有關當局可否告知本會：

（一）因應大型音樂活動及演唱會盛事陸續舉行，政府有否建立跨部門恆常協作機制，在每項有關的大型活動舉行前進行評估和部署，並在事後作出總結和適時公布情況；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於體育園開幕前後，亞洲國際博覽館及各體育場館均有大型演唱會舉行，政府有否統計該等演唱會的入場人數，以及當中本地、外地和內地觀眾的比例分別為何；及

（三）政府有否評估上述的大型演唱會舉行期間，對推動酒店、餐飲、零售、交通等行業增長和創造就業機會等方面的經濟效益為何；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

舉辦演唱會帶來可觀的經濟效益和就業機會，亦能帶動社會氣氛，刺激本地消費。政府十分歡迎各商業機構在香港舉辦外地和本地歌星及組合的演唱會。其中，啟德體育園於今年三月正式啟用，為香港帶來規模最大和最頂尖的活動場地，並已迅速成為大型國際娛樂及體育盛事的新據點。

就黃英豪議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局和保安局，現回覆如下：

（一）為了讓參與大型演唱會的市民和旅客獲得良好體驗，各相關部門和機構（例如康樂及文化事務署、香港警務處、運輸署、活動主辦方、場地管理方及公共交通營辦商）會就每個大型演唱會保持緊密聯繫，商討各項細節安排，例如進行風險評估及人手資源部署，制定並落實人流管控、信息發布、交通疏導及口岸安排的綜合預案，以確保活動安全有序地進行，並準備充分預案應對突發情況。

就啟德體育園而言，文化體育及旅遊局一直監督和指導啟德體育園有限公司（體育園營運公司）與各政府部門、活動主辦方及公共交通營運商的溝通和合作，制定不同準備工作，包括根據演唱會人數、性質、結束時間和票務情況的因素進行評估，並按需要制定相應安排，例如開設特別巴士路線、加密港鐵服務和通報口岸。體育園營運公司亦會在大型演唱會前發放新聞稿和於社交平台上發布最新活動安排和場地守則。在演唱會結束後，相關部門和營運公司會總結經驗以進一步優化往後的運作。

為疏導大型活動完結後經各邊境管制站過境的旅客，相關部門會密切監察各管制站的實時情況，於有需要時彈性調配人手加開檢查櫃枱及通道，以疏導人流及車流。相關部門亦會與內地對應口岸的相關部門保持緊密聯繫，確保口岸運作暢順。

以今年五月二十四日晚上分別在啟德體育園、亞洲國際博覽館、香港體育館舉行三場演唱會後的交通安排為例，由於預期有相當數量的旅客在演唱會後經落馬洲／皇崗口岸返回內地，運輸署提前與跨境巴士和落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的營辦商作出協調，以加密班次疏導旅客。就啟德體育園而言，當晚投入服務的跨境巴士數量為平日的雙倍，並在演唱會結束後的一小時內完成疏導預先購票的約3 300位旅客；而皇巴經加密班次後，亦在一小時內（由凌晨零時至一時許）基本完成接載所有旅客由新田總站前往落馬洲管制站。

（二）及（三）根據我們的估計，二○二四年至二○二五年上半年會有超過285場過萬名觀眾的大型演唱會，粗略估算這些演唱會有超過390萬名觀眾；當中有超過140萬旅客，他們為香港帶來約34億元消費額，經濟增加值約19億元。

二○二四年至二○二五年（截至五月三十一日）期間，在啟德主場館和啟德體藝館、亞洲國際博覽館、香港體育館及伊利沙伯體育館舉辦的所有演唱會入場人數表列如下：

立法會十一題：人才入境計劃的申請費及簽證費,2025-06-18 11:20,2025-06-18 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800249.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上盧偉國議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

財政司司長在二○二五至二六年度的《財政預算案》中宣布，各項人才及資本投資者入境計劃將收取申請費600元，獲批申請的簽證費用則由本來劃一收費230元，按簽證／入境證逗留期限長短上調至600元（不超過180日）或1,300元（181日或以上）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，入境事務處就各項人才入境計劃簽證申請收取230元簽證費用的人數為何，並按簽證／入境證逗留期限（即七日或以下、八日至一個月、兩個月至六個月，以及六個月以上）列出分項數字；

（二）有否預計，在新收費架構下，每年繳付600元及1,300‍元簽證／入境證簽發費的人數，以及政府相應收到的申請費和簽證費總額分別為何；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見指出，新的簽證費（逗留期限不超過180‍天）加上申請費實際上是由230元增至1,200元，對於短暫來港工作的人士（例如來港一兩天為粵劇表演作樂曲拍和的樂師）影響甚大，也不利於「灣區文旅一盤棋」等文化旅遊政策目標的落實，當局會否考慮為該等短暫來港工作人士減免相關簽證費用；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

各項人才與資本投資者的入境計劃（指定入境計劃）自推出或優化以來廣受歡迎。就人才入境計劃而言，首次入境申請數目由二○二二年約58000宗激增至二○二三年超過221000宗及二○二四年約208000宗，增幅超過250%。處理此類申請需要大量行政資源。在參考海外地區類似申請的收費後，政府決定在《2025-26年度財政預算案》公布當天起，就指定入境計劃的每宗入境、改變逗留條件或延長逗留限期的申請（包括主申請人及其受養人的申請）增設600元的申請費，而簽證／入境證的簽發費則按其逗留期限長短實施兩級制收費，由原來的230元上調至600元（逗留期限180日或以下）或1,300元（逗留期限181日或以上），以反映成本及體現「用者自付」原則。

就議員的提問，經諮詢入境事務處（入境處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（三）現時七個人才入境計劃中，高端人才通行證計劃、優秀人才入境計劃、非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排、輸入中國籍香港永久性居民第二代計劃和科技人才入境計劃下首次獲批的簽證／入境證有效期一般為24個月或以上。至於與就業掛鈎的一般就業政策和輸入內地人才計劃，申請人獲批的簽證／入境證有效期一般根據其僱傭合約有效期限而定，由一天至36個月不等。

在二○二二至二三年度，各項人才入境計劃下各類型申請有約16萬宗獲入境處批准；二○二三至二四和二○二四至二五年度均有約30萬宗獲批申請。入境處沒有備存問題問及的其他分項數字，惟按日常處理經驗，在一般就業政策和輸入內地人才計劃下，超過一半的獲批申請涉及短期／一次性項目為本的工作，例如會議和表演。這些簽證／入境證的逗留期限一般為180天或以下。考慮到相關情況，政府就簽證／入境證簽發費實施兩級制，其中逗留期限不超過180日的簽證的費用定為600元，而逗留期限為181日或以上的則為1,300元。我們認為有關收費水平合理，已平衡各方面的考慮因素，包括「用者自付」原則及對相關申請者的影響，而對於入境計劃所針對的人才和資本投資者來説亦為可負擔的水平。過去數月指定入境計劃的申請和簽證／入境證簽發數目與去年同期相若，可見新收費架構並無影響香港對外來人才的吸引力。

（二）在考慮新收費架構時，政府根據二○二三年初至二○二四年八月底的相關數據，估算二○二五至二六至二○二八至二九年三個財政年度內，每年將收到約40萬宗指定入境計劃各類型申請，並發出約34萬張逗留期限為181日或以上的簽證／入境證，而逗留期限不超過180日的則為約26000張。以此為基礎，估計未來三個財政年度每年因新收費結構而產生的收入約為七億元，當中包括約2.5億元申請費及約4.5億簽證／入境證簽發費。"
LCQ11: Application fee and visa fee for talent admission schemes,2025-06-18 11:20,2025-06-18 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800250.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 The Financial Secretary announced in the 2025-2026 Budget that an application fee of $600 would be charged for various talent and capital investment admission schemes. The visa fee for approved applications would also increase based on the length of limit of stay of the visa/entry permit, rising from the original flat rate of $230 to $600 (not more than 180 days) or $1,300 (181 days or more). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of persons charged a visa fee of $230 by the Immigration Department for visa applications under various talent admission schemes over the past three years, with a breakdown by length of stay of the visa/entry permit (i.e. seven days or less, eight days to one month, two months to six months, and over six months);

(2) whether it has estimated the respective numbers of persons who will pay $600 and $1,300 visa/entry permit issuance fees each year under the new fee structure, as well as the corresponding total amount of application and visa fees received by the Government accordingly; if it has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that the new visa fee (with a limit of stay of not more than 180 days) together with the application fee, has actually increased from $230 to $1,200, which will greatly impact those coming to Hong Kong for short-term work (e.g. musicians coming to Hong Kong to compose and perform music for Cantonese opera performances for one to two days), and it is not conducive to the implementation of the policy objectives on culture and tourism, such as the integrated development of culture and tourism in the Greater Bay Area, whether the authorities will consider waiving the relevant visa fees for persons coming to Hong Kong for short-term employment; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The various admission schemes for talents and capital investors (specified admission schemes) have been well received since their introduction or enhancement. In respect of talent admission schemes, the number of applications for first entry has grown from around 58000 in 2022 to more than 221000 in 2023 and around 208000 in 2024, representing an increase of more than 250 per cent compared with 2022. Processing such applications involve substantial administrative resources. With reference to the fees charged for similar applications in overseas jurisdictions, the Government decided to, with effect from the day of the announcement of the 2025-26 Budget, introduce an application fee of $600 for each of the applications under the specified admission schemes for entry, change of conditions of stay or extension of limit of stay (including principal and dependant applications); and the visa/entry permit fees for approved applications will be increased, based on the length of the limit of stay, from the original rate of $230 to $600 (with a limit of stay of 180 days or below) or $1,300 (with a limit of stay of 181 days or more) to peg to their costs and reflect the ""user pays"" principle.

 Our reply, in consultation with the Immigration Department (ImmD), to the Member's questions is as follows:

(1) and (3) At present, among the seven talent admission schemes, the validity period of the first approved visas/entry permits under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, theQuality Migrant Admission Scheme, theImmigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates, theAdmission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents, and theTechnology Talent Admission Scheme is generally 24 months or above. For the employment-tied General Employment Policy (GEP) andtheAdmission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP), the validity period of the applicants' approved visas/entry permits is generally determined by the validity period of their employment contracts, ranging from one day to 36 months.

 In 2022-23, about 160000 applications of different types under the various talent admission schemes were approved by the ImmD; and about 300000 applications were approved in both 2023-24 and 2024-‍25. The ImmD does not maintain the other statistical breakdowns referred to in the question. However, based on the experience from day-to-day processing, more than half of the approved applications under the GEP and the ASMTP are related to short-term/one-off project-based employment, e.g. for conference and performance, with a limit of stay of 180 days or below. Taking into account the relevant circumstances, the Government introduced two tiers of visa/entry permit issuance fee, which is set at $600 for visa granted with a limit of stay of not more than 180 days, and $1,300 for those with a limit of stay of 181 days or more. We consider that the fee levels are modest, and have balanced various considerations including the ""user pays"" principle and the impact on the applicants concerned. They are affordable to talent and capital investors targeted by the admission schemes. The numbers of applications and visas/entry permits issued under the specified admission schemes in the past few months are comparable to those in the same period last year, indicating that the new fee structure has not affected Hong Kong's attractiveness to outside talent.

(2) In considering the new fee structure, the Government, based on the relevant statistics from early 2023 to end August 2024, estimated that the annual caseload for the three financial years from 2025-26 to 2028-29 would be about 400000 applications of different types under the specified admission schemes; approximately 340000 visas/entry permits would be issued for a limit of stay of 181 days or more, while around 26000 will be issued for a limit of stay of not more than 180 days. On this basis, the estimated annual revenue in the next three financial years arising from the new fee structure is around $700 million, comprising about $250 million of application fees and about $450 million of visa/entry permit issuance fees."

Question:

According to the information of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC), the working population in the Hong Kong Science Park (HKSP) has increased substantially from 13 500 to 24 000 over the past three years. Regarding the ancillary transport facilities for HKSP, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether comprehensive assessment and adjustment relating to the ancillary transport facilities in HKSP have been made by the authorities in the past three years in response to the growth of the working population in HKSP; if so, of the details; if not, whether such assessment and adjustment will be made;

(2) given that, according to the paper submitted by the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau and the Innovation and Technology Commission to the Panel on Commerce, Industry, Innovation and Technology of this Council on July 16 last year, the works of Batch 1 of Stage 2 of the Science Park Expansion Programme is expected to be completed in the first quarter of this year, whether the works have been completed, and of the details of the relevant additional transport planning support facilities;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on whether the on-time performance of the public bus and minibus routes in HKSP is up to standard; if it has compiled the statistics and the outcome is in the negative, of the measures to improve the on-time performance of the relevant services;

(4) whether it knows if HKSTPC has regularly collected feedback from the people working in and business operators in HKSP on the ancillary transport facilities in HKSP; if HKSTPC has, of the details; if not, whether HKSTPC will make the relevant arrangements;

(5) as quite a number of people working in HKSP have relayed that they have wasted considerable time waiting for buses since the waiting time for a number of public bus routes in HKSP during non-peak hours is 15 to 30 minutes, whether the authorities will discuss with the franchised bus companies to increase bus service frequencies during non-peak hours;

(6) whether it knows if HKSTPC has considered increasing the shuttle bus service frequencies for staff members working in HKSP; and

(7) as it has been reported that the Transport Department is taking forward the project on automated light buses travelling between HKSP and the MTR University Station, whether the authorities have confirmed the specific implementation timetable for the project; of the routes of the automated light buses, and whether such routes will run through the various buildings and major facilities in HKSP, so as to facilitate mobility of the people working in and visitors to HKSP?

Reply:

President,

The Transport Department (TD) has been working closely with the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) to closely monitor the transport demand of the Hong Kong Science Park (HKSP) with a view to planning suitable transportation facilities and services to facilitate the commuting of HKSP staff for work. Having consulted the TD, the Innovation and Technology Commission and HKSTPC, our reply to Professor the Hon William Wong's questions is as follows:

(1) To cater for the transportation needs of HKSP staff to commute to and from work, 20 franchised bus routes terminating or passing through HKSP are currently in service during the morning and evening peak hours on working days. Their service areas cover a wide range of districts across the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories, including Sha Tin, North District, Tai Po, Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Tsuen Wan, Kwai Tsing, Tseung Kwan O, Kwun Tong, Yau Tsim Mong, Wan Chai, Eastern District and Islands District (including the Airport). In addition, there are six franchised bus routes and five green minibus (GMB) routes providing whole-day feeder services during non-peak hours, which connect HKSP to the MTR University Station, MTR Shatin Station, Sha Tin and Ma On Shan.

The TD has all along been actively maintaining close liaison with the relevant public transport operators (PTOs) to timely adjust the services to and from HKSP in light of changes in passenger demand, so as to meet the travelling needs of passengers. In the past few years, having regard to the development of HKSP and its vicinity as well as changes in passenger demand, the TD has enhanced the transport services to and from HKSP upon discussion and co-ordination with PTOs. These include introducing new franchised bus routes, arranging for special departures and increasing services during peak hours. Details are set out at the Annex.

(2) Batch 1 of Stage 2 of the HKSP Expansion Programme involves the construction of a building primarily for wet laboratories (i.e. Building 18W), the construction of public transport facilities on the Science Park East Avenue, and improvement works at the junction of Science Park Road and Chong San Road. Relevant improvement works at the junction of Science Park Road and Chong San Road were completed and commissioned in December last year; the construction of Building 18W was completed in March 2025 and is expected to be commissioned in July 2025; while the public transport facilities are expected to be commissioned upon completion in July 2025.

The TD has discussed with franchised bus operators (FBOs) regarding the development of HKSP and will flexibly enhance the services in light of the patronage in due course (such as strengthening the service of KMB Route No. 272K).

(3) According to TD's observation, the highest occupancy rate of the current franchised bus routes serving HKSP during the busiest hours ranges from about 10 per cent to 70 per cent, illustrating that the service can meet the passenger demand. Overall speaking, FBOs have generally been able to provide services in accordance with the scheduled timetable except for circumstances beyond their control (such as delays and lost trips resulting from inclement weather, unexpected traffic congestion or other incidents).

GMB operators serving HKSP are able to deploy resources flexibly to enhance the services in response to passenger demand. In fact, the actual services of the routes concerned during peak hours are more frequent than scheduled to flexibly meet passenger demand during these periods.

(4) HKSTPC conducts transportation surveys with tenants and merchants from time to time. The latest survey was conducted in the third quarter of last year with more than 1 000 questionnaires collected. Major views included requests for lowering fares and increasing frequencies. HKSTPC will take into account relevant survey results in reviewing the operational arrangements for the employees' bus service of HKSP.

(5) As mentioned above, there are six franchised bus routes providing services to and from HKSP during non-peak hours. In fact, the TD reviews the overall demand for transportation services in HKSP from time to time. For instance, to improve the transportation services during non-peak hours, the TD rationalised the resources of two franchised bus routes (i.e. Route Nos. 272A and 272K) in January this year with a view to enhancing the off-peak services connecting HKSP to the MTR University Station. The TD will continue to monitor the operation of public transport services in HKSP and timely discuss with PTOs on service enhancement proposals having regard to the passenger demand.

(6) Given that the current patronage of the employees' bus service of HKSP is still far below its maximum carrying capacity, HKSTPC has no plans to increase the frequency of the shuttle bus service at present. Nonetheless, HKSTPC will closely monitor the operation and patronage of the shuttle bus service, and optimise the bus routes and frequencies based on actual needs and operating conditions.

(7) Since 2017, autonomous vehicle (AV) projects operating under Movement Permits issued by the TD have been conducting trials within HKSP. These trials aim to assess the technical feasibility of AV applications in Hong Kong while gathering valuable data and experience. In 2024, the Government introduced a new regulatory regime for AVs, enabling the TD to provide flexibility for AV trials while ensuring road safety, so as to foster the trials and application of more advanced AV technologies in Hong Kong. To date, the TD has issued two pilot licences for AV trials in North Lantau and the West Kowloon Cultural District, proactively driving advancements in the application of this technology and assisting the trade in taking forward the projects, including autonomous light buses running between HKSP in Sha Tin and the MTR University Station. Funded by the Smart Traffic Fund, this project is currently under development. Upon completion of the autonomous driving system development, demonstrating safe operation through the subsequent assessment by the TD, the research institution expects to conduct road trials at the public roads of HKSP after acquiring a pilot licence by the first quarter of 2026. The proposed route is already under planning and is expected to cover the MTR University Station and the major buildings/facilities within HKSP, including the Harbour View Square on Science Park East Avenue and the Enterprise Place on Science Park West Avenue. Upon successful completion of the trial projects, we anticipate that the AV technology can be progressively refined and implemented to offer enhanced transportation alternatives for both HKSP and neighbouring communities."
立法會二十二題：香港科學園的交通配套,2025-06-18 11:16,2025-06-18 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800245.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上黃錦輝議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

根據香港科技園公司（該公司）的資料，於香港科學園（科學園）園區內工作的人數在過去三年由13 500人大幅增加至24 000人。就科學園的交通配套，政府可否告知本會：

答覆：

主席：

運輸署一直與香港科技園公司（科技園公司）密切監察香港科學園（科學園）的交通需求，以規劃合適的交通配套和服務，方便科學園的職員往返園區工作。就黃錦輝議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署、創新科技署及科技園公司後，現回覆如下：

（一）為配合科學園職員上下班的交通需求，現時有20條以科學園為總站或途經科學園的專營巴士路線於工作日的上下午繁忙時段提供服務。其服務範圍覆蓋港九新界多區，包括沙田、北區、大埔、屯門、元朗、荃灣、葵青、將軍澳、觀塘、油尖旺、灣仔、東區及離島區（包括機場）。另外，非繁忙時段亦設有六條專營巴士及五條專線小巴路線提供全日的穿梭服務，分別連接科學園及港鐵大學站、港鐵沙田站、沙田及馬鞍山。

運輸署一直積極與相關公共運輸服務營辦商（營辦商）保持緊密聯繫，因應乘客需求的變化，適時調整往返科學園的服務，以滿足乘客的出行需求。過去幾年，因應科學園及鄰近地區的發展及乘客需求變化，運輸署與營辦商商討及協調後，加強了來往科學園的交通服務，包括開辦新的專營巴士路線、安排特別班次、增加繁忙時段的服務等。詳情載於附件。

（二）科學園第二階段擴建計劃第一批次工程涉及興建一座主要用作濕實驗室的大樓（即18W大樓）、在科技大道東增加公共運輸設施，以及於科學園路／創新路路口進行改善工程。科學園路／創新路路口的改善工程已於去年十二月完成並啓用；18W大樓的建築工程已於今年三月完成，預計於今年七月啓用；而相關公共運輸設施則預計於今年七月完成並啓用。

運輸署已經與專營巴士營辦商因應科學園的園區發展情況進行商討，稍後將會因應乘客量靈活提升服務（例如加強九巴第272K號線的服務）。

（三）根據運輸署監察所見，現時服務科學園的專營巴士路線於最繁忙時段的最高載客率介乎約一成至約七成，顯示服務水平能夠應對乘客需求。整體而言，除專營巴士營辦商無法控制的情況外（例如惡劣天氣、突發的交通擠塞或其他事件引致班次延誤或脫班），專營巴士營辦商大致能依照編定的時間表提供服務。

服務科學園的專線小巴營辦商亦能按乘客需求，靈活調配資源加強服務。事實上，有關路線在繁忙時段的實際班次較編定班次更加頻密，以靈活應對該時段的乘客需求。

（四）科技園公司不時向租戶及商戶進行交通意見調查，最近一次調查於去年第三季進行，共收回超過一千份問卷，主要意見包括要求降低車費和增加班次。科技園公司會參考相關調查結果，以檢討科學園職員穿梭巴士的運作安排。

（五）正如上文所述，現時非繁忙時段設有六條專營巴士路線提供往返園區的服務。事實上，運輸署不時檢視園區的整體交通服務需求。舉例來說，為改善非繁忙時段的交通服務，運輸署於今年一月整合了兩條專營巴士路線（即第272A及272K號線）的資源，以提升非繁忙時段途經科學園接駁港鐵大學站的服務。運輸署會持續監察科學園的公共運輸服務運作情況，並根據乘客需求，適時與營辦商商討加強服務的方案。

（六）鑑於現時科學園職員穿梭巴士客量與最高許可載客量仍有相當距離，科技園公司現時未有計劃增加穿梭巴士的班次，但會密切監察穿梭巴士的營運情況及乘客量，因應實際需要和營運情況，優化穿梭巴士路線及班次。

（七）科學園園區內由二○一七年開始有經運輸署發出「車輛行駛許可證」的自動駕駛車輛（自動車）項目進行，測試自動車於本港應用的技術可行性，累積寶貴數據和經驗。政府於二○二四年推出新制訂的自動車規管框架，讓運輸署在確保道路安全的前提下為自動車測試提供彈性，提速提效促進更先進的自動車技術在本港測試和應用。至今，運輸署已分別向北大嶼山及西九文化區的自動駕駛測試項目發出兩張先導牌照，積極推動相關技術應用的躍進及協助業界推展有關項目，其中包括往來沙田香港科學園與港鐵大學站的自動駕駛小型巴士項目。此項目獲智慧交通基金資助，目前系統正在研發中，研發機構在完成研發、證明可安全運作並經運輸署審核後，預計可於明年第一季獲批先導牌照，隨後安排自動駕駛小型巴士在園區進行道路測試。該小型巴士的路線已在規劃中，預計途經港鐵大學站和科學園區內各大樓及主要設施，例如科技大道東的海濱廣場及科技大道西的企業廣場等。我們期望項目經測試後，能穩步優化和應用自動車技術，為園區及周邊社區提供更多便捷的交通選擇。"

《物流業ESG發展路線圖》推出　提升行業競爭力,2025-06-18 10:30,2025-06-18 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061700572.htm,"運輸及物流局今日（六月十八日）公布《物流業ESG發展路線圖》（《路線圖》），供本港物流中小企業遵循，以達致國際上就環境、社會及管治（ESG）的要求，從而提升香港物流業的競爭力，鞏固香港作為國際物流樞紐的地位。

綠色及可持續發展是政府在二○二三年十月公布的《現代物流發展行動綱領》（《行動綱領》）中就物流業指明的發展方向之一。為推動綠色和可持續物流發展，政府在《行動綱領》中承諾為業界制訂清晰的ESG路線圖，以協助物流企業逐步達致國際ESG的要求。運輸及物流局在進行顧問研究後，參考了國際ESG標準及市場現狀，並諮詢香港物流發展局及業界不同組織和人士的意見，制訂《路線圖》。

《路線圖》涵蓋二○二五至二○二七年的三年年期，分為三個階段，供物流中小企業建立收集和報告ESG數據的能力，從而在《路線圖》年期屆滿時達致當前最嚴格的國際ESG披露要求。第一階段包括提高物流中小企業對ESG原則及國際ESG要求的認知；第二階段包括加強物流中小企業收集和記錄物流ESG數據的能力；第三階段則旨在協助物流中小企業就編製ESG報告做好準備，預計這會在ESG下一發展階段成為國際要求。

運輸及物流局發言人表示：「ESG已成為國際趨勢，其中歐盟已自今年起強制要求企業就整個供應鏈進行ESG披露，內地亦正在制訂ESG信息披露標準，並計劃於二○三○年把相關標準涵蓋包括中小企業在內的所有企業。因此，對深度融入全球供應鏈的香港物流中小企業而言，實踐ESG已不是選擇，而是為保障企業生存和保持國際競爭力而必須踏出的一步。我們期望《路線圖》能為物流中小企業提供簡單易明的指導，有助其開展ESG實踐及提升行業競爭力，從而鞏固香港作為國際物流樞紐的地位。」

發言人續說：「推廣和培訓對物流中小企業完成上述《路線圖》各階段至關重要。就此，運輸及物流局將與業界人士、商會、專業團體及培訓機構合作，並鼓勵他們提供所需的支援，共同實踐《路線圖》。」

運輸及物流局緊接將聯同物流業界持份者推動《路線圖》的實施，並會在《路線圖》到期前因應當前的國際ESG標準等因素適時檢討和更新《路線圖》，助力物流中小企業繼續合規遵守ESG。

除《路線圖》外，運輸及物流局今日亦在香港物流發展局的網頁上推出線上ESG專題資源中心，是香港物流公司獲得ESG相關資訊的一站式門戶。此外，為協助物流業中小企業邁出實踐ESG的第一步，運輸及物流局將於今年內推出一套ESG數據收集工具，利便物流業中小企有效地收集和記錄遵守國際ESG披露要求所需的物流ESG數據。

《路線圖》已上載至運輸及物流局網頁。"
Roadmap for ESG Development for Logistics Industry announced to enhance competitiveness,2025-06-18 10:30,2025-06-18 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061700577.htm,"The Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) announced the Roadmap for ESG (environmental, social and governance) Development for Logistics Industry today (June 18) for local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the logistics industry to follow for achieving compliance with international ESG requirements, with an aim to enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's logistics industry and hence Hong Kong's position as an international logistics hub.

Green and sustainable development is one of the directions that the Government has specified for the way forward for the logistics industry in the Action Plan on Modern Logistics Development announced in October 2023. To promote the development of green and sustainable logistics, the Government has committed in the Action Plan to formulating a clear ESG roadmap for the industry to assist logistics enterprises in meeting international ESG requirements progressively. Upon conducting a consultancy study, the TLB has worked out the Roadmap by taking into account international ESG standards and current market developments while working in consultation with the Hong Kong Logistics Development Council and various organisations and players in the industry.

The Roadmap covers a three-year period from 2025 to 2027 and adopts a three-stage approach for logistics SMEs to build up their capabilities to collect and report ESG data, thereby meeting the most stringent prevailing international ESG disclosure requirements by the time the Roadmap expires. The first stage involves raising logistics SMEs' awareness of ESG principles and international ESG requirements, the second stage involves equipping logistics SMEs with the capability to collect and record logistics ESG data, while the third stage aims to prepare logistics SMEs for ESG reporting, which is foreseen to be a possible international requirement in the next phase of ESG development.

A spokesperson for the TLB said, ""ESG has become an international trend, with the European Union having already made ESG disclosures along the whole supply chain compulsory for enterprises from this year onwards, and the Mainland also formulating its own ESG disclosure standards that are planned to be applicable to all companies, including SMEs, by 2030. Therefore, for Hong Kong logistics SMEs, which are well-plugged into the global supply chain, ESG adoption is no longer an option but an essential step for their survival and maintenance of their global competitiveness. We hope that the Roadmap will provide logistics SMEs with an easy-to-follow guide to embark on their ESG journey and help to enhance the competitiveness of our logistics industry, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international logistics hub.

""Promotion and training will be crucial for logistics SMEs to reach each of the aforesaid stages of the Roadmap. In this connection, the TLB will collaborate with and encourage industry players, trade associations, professional bodies and training institutions to provide necessary support to deliver the Roadmap,"" the spokesman added.

As the next step, the TLB will promote the adoption of the Roadmap in association with industry stakeholders, and will review and update the Roadmap in a timely manner ahead of its expiry with reference to the prevailing international ESG requirements, among others, to help logistics SMEs to continue to be ESG-compliant.

Apart from the ESG Roadmap, the TLB also launched today a dedicated online ESG resource centre on the website of the Council, which serves as a one-stop portal for information related to ESG for reference by logistics companies in Hong Kong. In addition, to assist logistics SMEs in starting their ESG journey, the TLB will launch within this year a set of ESG data collection tools that will facilitate effective collection and recording of logistics ESG data essential for compliance with international ESG disclosure requirements by SMEs.

The ESG roadmap has been uploaded to theTLB's website."

尊敬的吳偉副市長（上海市委常委、常務副市長）、周小全主任（上海市推進國際金融中心建設辦公室主任、上海市地方金融管理局局長）、許正宇局長（財經事務及庫務局局長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家上午好！很高興出席今天早上的《滬港國際金融中心協同發展行動方案》（《行動方案》）發布儀式。首先，我謹代表香港特區政府，向吳市長、向所有參與《行動方案》工作的滬港兩地政府部門、機構和朋友們表示最衷心的感謝！

上海與香港都是國家的國際金融中心，一直以來在國家金融改革和高水平對外開放中擔當重要的角色。這次發布的行動方案，貫徹國家關於增強上海國際金融中心競爭力和影響力和鞏固提升香港國際金融中心地位的要求，深化兩地金融市場的互聯互通，豐富彼此在多個範疇的合作和聯動發展，服務國家金融強國發展戰略，意義重大。

這次《行動方案》進一步明確了滬港合作的具體方向，包括金融市場互聯互通、跨境金融服務創新、綠色金融發展、科技金融合作等，為兩地多層次、多領域的金融合作注入了新的、更豐富的內容。其中，有幾點特別值得説明：

一是深化互聯互通的新措施。內地與香港金融市場的互聯互通，自二○一四年滬港通啓動揭開了序幕，其後不斷深化擴容。這次行動方案是在兩地堅實的合作基礎上，開創新的領域。例如，在跨境清算上的合作、在黃金產品和交易上的互聯互通、在數字人民幣跨境支付上的新應用場景，以及上海金融機構通過香港拓展再保險業務等等。可以説，滬港金融合作正在不斷架設新橋樑、拓寬行車道，互利共贏的合作前景更加亮麗。

二是突出對內地企業「走出去」的支持。行動方案提出了具體措施，通過更高效連接滬港兩地的金融機構、支付網絡，以及資金管理體系等，支持內地企業出海。在國家高水平雙向開放和當前國際地緣政治形勢下，內地企業更有興趣和需要在全球佈局供應鏈、產業鏈，開拓新市場之際，這些措施可謂正值其時。事實上，香港一直不斷推進改革，鞏固提升國際籌融資平台的競爭力和吸引力，希望能助力更多內地的優質企業走向國際發展。在中央部委的大力支持下，不斷有內地龍頭企業來港上市，今年以來香港新股集資額處於全球領先位置，股市表現在世界上名列前茅。此外，香港也提供貿易融資、供應鏈管理、現代物流、財資管理、專業諮詢等高增值服務，全方位助力內地企業成功「走出去」。

三是推動標準對接和金融創新。根據行動方案，兩地將加強在金融標準、產品創新、信息共享等領域的合作，並推動人工智能、區塊鏈等技術更廣泛應用於資產管理、保險以及支付結算等場景。同時，也致力通過金融政策來支持創科產業的發展，比如説，鼓勵保險機構將兩地新藥械納入保障範圍，促進生物醫藥產業發展。此外，上海正在加快建成具有全球影響力的科技創新高地，香港也正與粵港澳大灣區城市群建設成為功能全面的國際創科中心，我們彼此的進一步合作，將會為有關產業帶來更多金融「活水」支持。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，當前全球政經形勢紛繁複雜，金融風險多變，在這樣的形勢下，滬港兩地更需要攜手合作，共同強化金融競爭力，把握好變局中的機遇。我相信，在國家的大力支持下，香港與上海這兩個國際金融中心，強強聯手，將發揮更大的聯動和協同效益，為國家的金融強國建設貢獻更大力量，也為全球金融市場的發展注入更多中國智慧與力量。謝謝！"

二是突出對內地企業「走出去」的支持。行動方案提出了具體措施，通過更高效連接滬港兩地的金融機構、支付網絡，以及資金管理體系等，支持內地企業出海。在國家高水平雙向開放和當前國際地緣政治形勢下，內地企業更有興趣和需要在全球佈局供應鏈、產業鏈，開拓新市場之際，這些措施可謂正值其時。事實上，香港一直不斷推進改革，鞏固提升國際籌融資平台的競爭力和吸引力，希望能助力更多內地的優質企業走向國際發展。在中央部委的大力支持下，不斷有內地龍頭企業來港上市，今年以來香港新股集資額處於全球領先位置，股市表現在世界上名列前茅。此外，香港也提供貿易融資、供應鏈管理、現代物流、財資管理、專業諮詢等高增值服務，全方位助力內地企業成功「走出去」。

三是推動標準對接和金融創新。根據行動方案，兩地將加強在金融標準、產品創新、信息共享等領域的合作，並推動人工智能、區塊鏈等技術更廣泛應用於資產管理、保險以及支付結算等場景。同時，也致力通過金融政策來支持創科產業的發展，比如説，鼓勵保險機構將兩地新藥械納入保障範圍，促進生物醫藥產業發展。此外，上海正在加快建成具有全球影響力的科技創新高地，香港也正與粵港澳大灣區城市群建設成為功能全面的國際創科中心，我們彼此的進一步合作，將會為有關產業帶來更多金融「活水」支持。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，當前全球政經形勢紛繁複雜，金融風險多變，在這樣的形勢下，滬港兩地更需要攜手合作，共同強化金融競爭力，把握好變局中的機遇。我相信，在國家的大力支持下，香港與上海這兩個國際金融中心，強強聯手，將發揮更大的聯動和協同效益，為國家的金融強國建設貢獻更大力量，也為全球金融市場的發展注入更多中國智慧與力量。謝謝！"

行政長官出席民主思路「十年見證」經濟論壇暨籌款晚宴致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-06-17 21:51,2025-06-17 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700887.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（六月十七日）出席民主思路「十年見證」經濟論壇暨籌款晚宴致辭的致辭：

湯家驊召集人（民主思路召集人）、各位民主思路成員、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

我很高興出席今晚的活動，與大家一同慶祝民主思路十周年的意義時刻。我首先祝賀民主思路繼往開來，更進一步。

剛才Ronny（民主思路召集人湯家驊）說了很多關於智庫的事。其實對我來說公眾諮詢是無時不做，任何時候政府都聽意見，支持的意見聽、不支持的意見也聽、差異的意見更聽。中國有很多智慧，其中一個我很欣賞的就是「聞異則喜」，聽到有不同聲音而開心；「無異則疑」，完全好像一言堂；最重要是「辨異生智」，大家討論大家不同意的觀點，不要緊的，智慧就是這麼來的；但最重要是「求同存異」。四個都是「異」字，但是充滿智慧，亦都是我很信奉和希望大家一同履行的智慧；智庫最重要就是給我們帶來智慧。

今晚活動聚焦香港的前景與挑戰，讓我們探討香港經濟形勢以至智庫在「一國兩制」實踐的新階段下可擔當的角色。

目前，全球地緣政治風險不斷升溫，單邊主義破壞國際貿易秩序。面對複雜的外圍環境，香港積極發揮在「一國兩制」下內聯外通的優勢，在金融、貿易等領域推動全速發展，彰顯內地以至國際投資者對香港的堅定信心。今日發表的世界競爭力報告，香港又再升兩位成為世界第三，這個亦是反映投資者對香港的信心。

根據最新的數據，香港整體商品出口貨值在今年四月超過4,300億港元，按年增長近百分之十五，恒生指數今年以來累計上升了超過3 800點，升幅約兩成，在全球主要指數中表現名列前茅。股市平均成交金額大增近1.2倍，達到每日平均2,420億元。

面對世界百年未有之大變局加速演進，我們要居安思危，為未來發展發掘更多新增長點，讓增長動能生生不息。智庫在這裏有很重要角色，可以匯聚專家學者、社會賢達，為思想革新創造能量、共繪智慧寶藏。智庫不但能作出學術研討，更可為推動社會進步時提出不同意見，凝聚社會力量和共識。

我上任後成立了特首政策組，大家可能不知道我和特首政策組的密切聯繫。其實，特首政策組進行很多政策研究，它和大家一樣也是智庫。但我考慮任何智庫提出的意見時，不會只看意見，更會看其證據和邏輯，這是重要的。所以元山（黃元山博士）作為特首政策組組長，他是艱辛的，很多時候他上來時我有一些新的問題。他做得很好，但我是一個「無異則疑」的人，所以很多時候我有一些新想法希望他替我搜集更多證據。我亦很高興他們做得成績很好，而且我要求特首政策組積極與不同智庫緊密聯繫，通過實證為本的研究，促進研究轉化為實際和具體的政策措施，發揮功能。

民主思路一直通過研究與培訓，貢獻公共政策思考，培育本地人才。民主思路致力推動社會深入理解「一國兩制」，又通過特首政策組的「政策研究資助計劃」，就社會議題發表報告，協助政府制定策略。

民主思路踏入十周年，亦進入了新階段。藉這機會，我想對廣大智庫組織提出三點寄語：

第一，繼續發揮橋樑作用，推動理性對話。剛才我們聽到，連AI（人工智能）有時也有其立場，所以兩個AI給出的結果是有差異的。但是，有差異其實是好事，讓我們對每一件事情都可以提出問題。所以智庫是連結政府、學界與社會的橋樑，我期望你們加強與特區政府溝通聯繫，促進不同界別海內外有關單位進行交流合作，在體系建設、經濟、民生等領域創造智慧，促進惠民政策。

第二，研究經濟新增長點，推動社會發展。我期望各智庫多為香港發展新質生產力發表真知灼見，聚焦北部都會區、深港河套創科園等香港未來重點發展和經濟推動，以及產業引入的一些重點項目。我亦希望智庫尤其針對一些重要的策略性發展領域，尤其是生物科技、人工智能、數字經濟等創科領域提供研究和建議。

第三，持續加強培訓，培育更多愛國愛港、具備國際視野的新一代人才。我期望你們善用在學術界、政商界的網絡，助力香港青年深刻認識世界發展大勢、深入了解國家的歷史文化和最新發展，讓他們早日成長為可堪大任的棟樑之才，確保香港由新一代薪火相傳。

最後，我再次祝賀民主思路成立十周年，我期待民主思路在下一個十年，繼續助力香港發展進步。我祝願今晚活動圓滿成功，在座各位工作愉快。多謝大家！"

The case involved a 26-year-old female passenger arriving in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds in her check-in suitcase. The woman was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (June 18).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
CHP investigates cluster of influenza A infections in primary school,2025-06-17 20:58,2025-06-17 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700819.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (June 17) investigating a cluster of influenza A infectionsin a primary school in Sham Shui Po. The CHP also appeals to members of the public to remain vigilant, maintain good personal and environmental hygiene, and receive seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV).

The cluster involves 46 persons, including 41 male students aged 7 to 10, and five staff members. They developed symptoms on or after June 7. Among them, 41 persons sought medical attention and three were hospitalised. Two were subsequently discharged and one remains hospitalised. All of the patients had mild symptoms. Laboratory testing revealed that respiratory specimens of the aforesaid three hospitalised students tested positivefor influenza A virus, while rapid antigen tests revealed that 32 teachers and students also tested positivefor influenza A virus.

The personnel of the CHP had inspected the primary school twice and found that inter-class and inter-grade activities were organised in the schools, and that individual function rooms and classrooms were not adequately ventilated, and items shared among the students were not thoroughly disinfected. The CHP has provided advice to the school management on prevention of upper respiratory tract infection, including thorough cleaning and disinfection, opening windows where appropriate for better ventilation, refraining infected students from going to school, stopping inter-class and inter-grade activities, wearing masks by teachers and students during the outbreak and conducting temperature monitoring on entering school, etc. The school is currently under medical surveillance.

To prevent outbreaks of influenza and other respiratory infections, it is of prime importance that children with fever, regardless of the presence of respiratory symptoms, should not be allowed to attend school, and should consult a doctor promptly. In addition, children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses are urged to get vaccinated as early as possible to prevent seasonal influenza.

Influenza vaccination has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications, while significantly reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death from seasonal influenza. All persons aged 6 months and above (except those with known contraindications), particularly the elderly and children who have a higher risk of becoming infected with influenza and developing complications, should be vaccinated. Although the level of influenza activity has remained low since the end of the winter influenza season, sporadic outbreaks in schools and residential institutions caused by influenza viruses are still possible, especially when there are gatherings of crowd coupled with inadequate infection control measures. The number of severe cases involving adults and cases of severe paediatric influenza-associated complications recorded in the influenza season earlier this year has significantly decreased compared with the 2018/19 influenza season. It is believed that this is the result of the general public's willingness to receive the SIV.

DEVB and works departments win nine Martin Barnes Awards in UK (with photos),2025-06-17 20:50,2025-06-17 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700744.htm,"Hong Kong's excellence in delivering public works projects received international recognition. The Development Bureau (DEVB) and works departments shone at the 2025 Martin Barnes Awards Ceremony in London, the United Kingdom, on June 16 (London time), winning nine awards from the 27 awards in eight categories (see Annex), including two prestigious winner awards, among 80 entries worldwide.

A prestigious honour in the industry, the Martin Barnes Awards are presented by the New Engineering Contract (NEC) Users' Group under the Institution of Civil Engineers of the United Kingdom. The awards recognise construction projects, organisations and individuals worldwide that have demonstrated excellence in project delivery through collaborative partnership.

The two winner awards are as follows:

1. The winner award for the Climate Change Initiative category was received by the Water Supplies Department (WSD) for the implementation of Shek Wu Hui Water Reclamation Plant. In the construction and operation of Hong Kong's first large-scale regional water reclamation plant, the WSD worked with the contractor through the NEC mechanism to develop an innovative and cost-effective fully automated reclaimed water production solution that saves energy and helps reduce carbon emissions. The facility supplies water for non-potable uses in Northern District and nearby new development areas. With the production process remaining unaffected by extreme weather, it not only conserves precious water resources but also enhances the resilience of Hong Kong's water resources portfolio, thus further improving the stability of the city's water resources.

2. The winner award for Distinguished Contribution category was received by Deputy Secretary for Development (Works) Mr Tony Ho, in recognition of his outstanding performance in promoting and deepening the application of the NEC in construction projects over the years, which has nurtured a collaborative culture in the industry. His proactive promotion of the adoption of advanced technologies has also enhanced the overall performance of construction projects.

In addition to the above two winner awards, the DEVB, the Civil Engineering and Development Department, the Drainage Services Department, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, and the Highways Department also received various awards for several notable NEC entries.

The Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, extended her congratulations to the project teams on their impressive achievements. She said, ""The DEVB and works departments have been committed to promoting collaborative partnerships in the delivery of public works projects through the adoption of the NEC form, enhancing mutual trust and co-operation among different industry stakeholders. Such collaborative partnerships help accomplish the primary goals of project management and enhance management efficiency and cost-effectiveness of projects. The awards fully demonstrate that their efforts and accomplishments have been recognised internationally.""

The NEC Users' Group also held its 2025 Annual Conference on the same day. The Director of Electrical and Mechanical Services, Mr Poon Kwok-ying, was invited to attend the plenary session to exchange ideas with a group of international experts on how to lead the industry in applying innovative technologies and integrating the use of the NEC form to enhance the effectiveness of implementing infrastructure projects.

Since the DEVB introduced the NEC form for public works projects in Hong Kong in 2009, it has become a key driver in transforming the construction industry. The NEC embraces a collaborative partnership between clients and contractors, thereby enhancing project performance. While the conventional form of contracts focused more on specifying contractual obligations and responsibilities of both parties, the NEC introduces a comprehensive project management system into its contractual provisions, including an early warning mechanism, a compensation mechanism between contractual parties and action plans. It advocates for contractual parties to work together to resolve contractual problems in a proactive and collaborative manner under this management system, thereby achieving win-win situations. As of today, more than 760 public works contracts, with a total value of over HK$510 billion, have adopted the NEC form."

Task Group on New Medical School meets for second time with universities that submitted proposals (with photos),2025-06-17 20:12,2025-06-17 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700783.htm,"  The Task Group on New Medical School met separately with the three universities that have submitted proposals for the establishment of the third medical school, namely Hong Kong Baptist University, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, for the second time today (June 17) to have a focused exchange on the specific implementation plans of their proposals. Each university further presented to the Task Group its overall plan for implementing the new medical school proposal, including the curriculum content, clinical training for medical students, construction of teaching facilities, and funding arrangements, and responded to the suggestions and targeted questions raised by the Task Group after the first meeting. The Task Group will enhance speed and efficiency in expediting the assessment of the proposals, with a view to completing the assessments and providing a recommendation to the Government within this year.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""I am pleased to see that all the three universities have demonstrated a strong commitment to nurturing medical talent and developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub, as well as responded positively to the key concerns raised by the Task Group, in particular, the quality of medical education and clinical training arrangements. As President Xi Jinping said, 'Health is the most important indicator of people's happiness.' The current-term Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government strives to comprehensively deepen the reform of the healthcare system, and the new medical school will not only shoulder the mission of coping with the rapidly ageing population and the worsening shortage of healthcare manpower, but also collaborate and pursue complementary development with the two existing medical schools, with a view to contributing to the long-term enhancement of the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of Hong Kong's healthcare system.""

  The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said, ""The establishment of the new medical school is not only a development project for an individual university, but also an important step in elevating Hong Kong's position as an international hub for medical education and innovation. The 2024-2035 master plan on building China into a leading country in education newly released by our nation strives to accelerate the development of world-class universities and advanced disciplines. We expect the selected university to take on the important task of actively promoting curriculum innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration and establishing closer ties with regional partners. In addition to facilitating the overall development of the university concerned, the new medical school will also be able to nurture more healthcare talent, raise academic standard and broaden the scope of medical education and research in Hong Kong.""

  Established in October last year, the Task Group comprises seasoned local, Mainland and overseas academics in medical education and university management, professionals, representatives from the Medical Council of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, as well as representatives from the relevant government bureaux and departments. It has already set the overall direction and parameters for establishing the new medical school. In December last year, the Task Group issued a letter of invitation to all University Grants Committee-funded universities to invite local universities interested in establishing the new medical school to submit proposals, and three proposals were receivedby the deadline. The Task Group's first round of meetings with each of the three universities that have submitted proposals was conducted on May 3 this year to have in-depth discussions on the proposals."
籌備新醫學院工作組與提交建議書的大學第二次會面（附圖）,2025-06-17 20:11,2025-06-17 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700778.htm,"籌備新醫學院工作組（工作組）今日（六月十七日）分別與已提交建設第三所醫學院建議書的三間大學（即香港浸會大學、香港理工大學和香港科技大學）第二次會面，就建議書的具體落實方案作重點交流。各大學分別向工作組進一步介紹其落實新醫學院建議的整體規劃，包括課程內容、醫學生臨床訓練、教學設施建設及資金安排等，並就工作組在第一次會面後提出的意見和針對性問題作出回應。工作組會提速提效加快評估建議書的工作，預期今年內完成評核，並向政府提出建議。

醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授說：「我很高興見到三間大學均展現出培育醫療人才和發展香港成為國際醫療創新樞紐的積極承擔，並對工作組提出的重點關注事項，尤其是醫學教育質素及臨床訓練安排作出積極回應。正如國家主席習近平所說，『健康是人民幸福生活最重要的指標』，本屆香港特別行政區政府致力全面深化醫療體系改革，而新醫學院不僅肩負應對現時人口急速老化和醫療人手短缺加劇的使命，更要與現有兩所醫學院並肩前行、錯位發展，為長遠提升香港醫療體系的質素、效率和可持續性作出貢獻。」

教育局局長蔡若蓮博士指出：「新醫學院的設立不僅是個別大學的發展項目，更是提升香港作為國際醫學教育與創新樞紐的重要一步。國家最新公布的《教育強國建設規劃綱要（2024-2035年）》提出加快建設世界一流的大學和優勢學科。我們期望獲選的大學能肩負重任，積極推動課程創新、跨學科協作，並與區域內的夥伴建立更緊密的聯繫，新醫學院除促進有關大學的整體發展，亦能培育更多醫療人才，提升學術水平，拓展本地醫學教育及研究的範疇。」

工作組於去年十月成立，由具豐富醫學教學和大學管理經驗的本地和海內外學者、專業人士、香港醫務委員會和香港醫學專科學院代表，以及相關政府政策局和部門代表組成，並已制定設立新醫學院的方向及準則。工作組去年十二月向所有大學教育資助委員會資助大學發信，邀請有意成立新醫學院的本地大學提交建設第三所醫學院建議書，截止前共接獲三份建議書。工作組於今年五月三日已分別與提交建議書的三間大學首次會面，就其建議書作深入討論。"
衞生防護中心調查小學甲型流感個案群組,2025-06-17 19:48,2025-06-17 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700786.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（六月十七日）正調查深水埗一所小學的甲型流感個案群組。中心同時呼籲市民提高警覺，時刻保持個人和環境衞生，及接種季節性流感疫苗。

個案涉及46人，包括41名年齡介乎7至10歲的男學生，和五名學校職員。他們自六月七日起先後出現病徵，其中41人已經求醫，三人需留院治療，兩人其後已出院，尚有一人留醫，全部人病況輕微。三名曾入院學生的呼吸道樣本經化驗後對甲型流感病毒呈陽性反應，另有32名受影響師生曾進行快速抗原測試，對甲型流感病毒呈陽性反應。

中心人員已兩度到該小學視察，發現該校曾經舉行跨班別和跨級別活動，而且個別活動室及班房通風不足，學生共用物品亦未有徹底清潔消毒。中心人員已向校方提供有關預防上呼吸道感染的建議，包括徹底進行清潔消毒、適當開啓窗戶以保持良好通風、染病學童不應上學、停止進行跨班別和跨級別活動、師生於爆發期間佩戴口罩和進校時進行體溫監測等。該校正接受醫學監察。

為防止流感或其他呼吸道傳染病的爆發，學童如出現發熱，不論是否有呼吸道感染病徵，都不應回校上課，並應盡早求醫。此外，中心呼籲兒童、長者和長期病患者，盡早接種流感疫苗，預防季節性流感。

接種流感疫苗是其中一種最有效預防季節性流感及其併發症的方法，同時可大大減少因感染季節性流感而入院留醫和死亡的風險。所有年滿六個月或以上人士（除有已知禁忌症外），尤其是長者及兒童等有較高風險患上流感及出現併發症的人士。雖然流感活躍程度自冬季流感季節完結後維持在低水平，但流感病毒引致的學校及院舍零星爆發仍有機會出現，尤其在人群密切聚集加上感染控制措施不足的時候。今年初流感季節中的成人嚴重個案數字和兒童流感相關的嚴重併發症個案，較二○一八／一九流感季節大幅減少，我們相信正是市民願意接種季節性流感疫苗的成果。

市民可參閱中心的網頁，了解更多有關流感及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞周報的資訊。"
FEHD earnestly follows up on court ruling against eight former Principal Hawker Control Officers,2025-06-17 19:00,2025-06-17 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700719.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) emphasised today (June 17) that the FEHD attaches great importance to staff discipline and integrity and will not condone any misconduct or illegal behaviour, following the District Court's sentencing of eight former Principal Hawker Control Officers for conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. Any staff members found guilty of a criminal offence will not only be subject to court sentencing but will also face disciplinary sanctions by the department in accordance with the established civil service disciplinary mechanism. When conducting civil service recruitment exercises, civil servants must strictly comply with the relevant policies and procedures and ensure that the recruitment process is conducted according to the principles of fairness, transparency, and merits.

The FEHD will seek advice from the Civil Service Bureau to determine appropriate follow-up actions following the court judgment, including whether to consider cancelling, suspending, or reducing the pension benefits of the officers concerned under Section 29 of the Pension Benefits Ordinance (Cap. 99).

Following the incident, the FEHD has reviewed the recruitment procedures for Assistant Hawker Control Officers and introduced refinements to the modus operandi and the monitoring mechanism. Such enhancements include emphasising to recruitment board chairpersons and members that failure to uphold the principles of fairness, impartiality, and confidentiality during the selection process may result in disciplinary action or even criminal liability; adjusting the composition of recruitment boards to ensure a more balanced representation of relevant grades and enhance objectivity and diversity in the selection process; providing additional guidance to board secretaries to strengthen their role in supporting procedural fairness; and arranging for supervisory staff to observe interviews on an irregular basis and offer feedback on overall selection arrangements with a view to further ascertaining the propriety of the process.

In addition, the FEHD has strengthened integrity training for enforcement and supervisory officers at all levels, including inviting officers of the Independent Commission Against Corruption to conduct seminars on anti-corruption laws and related administrative codes to heighten staff awareness of corruption risks and the offence of misconduct in public office. The department also continues to use various channels to remind staff at all levels of the importance of upholding core civil service values and conduct at all times."

署方會諮詢公務員事務局的意見，探討因應有關人員的定罪而可能須作出的跟進行動，包括是否根據香港法例《退休金利益條例》（第99章）第29條，考慮取消、暫停支付或扣減其退休金利益。

在事件發生後，署方已檢視助理小販管理主任的招聘程序，並優化有關安排及監察機制，包括在為招聘委員會主席和成員舉辦的簡介會上，強調若遴選過程未能遵守公平、公正及保密原則，可能會導致紀律處分甚至構成刑事罪行；調整招聘委員會內相關職系人員的比例，以提升遴選過程的客觀性及多樣性；為招聘委員會秘書提供額外輔導，以加強其就維護遴選程序的公平和恰當方面的支援角色；以及安排監督人員不定時旁聽面試過程，並就整體遴選安排給予意見，以進一步完善有關程序。

同時，署方已加強對各級執法人員及督導人員的誠信培訓，包括邀請廉政公署人員舉辦講座，詳述防貪法例及相關的行政守則，以提高其對貪污風險及公職人員行為失當罪的警覺性。署方亦持續透過不同渠道，提醒各級人員時刻秉持公務員應有的價值及行為操守的必要性。"

Mr Sun emphasised that the LWB and the SWD will continue to organise activities to promote national security education and patriotism in the sector in partnership with the Connecting Hearts and encourage organisations providing subvented welfare services to make good use of the Dedicated Fund to enhance their staff's understanding of national affairs by arranging for them to join Mainland exchange tours and national studies programmes. He said that the overwhelming response from social workers on the Thousands of Hong Kong Social Workers Exploring the Motherland and Hong Kong Social Work Teaching Staff Exploring the Motherland tours is a clear indication of the sector's wish to obtain a better and more comprehensive understanding of the overall national development.

Public urged not to buy or use topical products containing undeclared controlled ingredients (with photo),2025-06-17 18:40,2025-06-17 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700709.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (June 17) appealed to the public not to buy or use four types of topical products as they were found to contain undeclared controlled drug ingredients. These products include:




Product name
Part 1 poisons found


1. Zangyao xuanduwang
Clobetasol propionate, ketoconazole and miconazole


2. King poison to itch Antibacterial cream
Clobetasol propionate, ketoconazole and miconazole


3. HE SHENG MEI LANG DU WANG
Clobetasol propionate, ketoconazole and miconazole


4. ZHONG HUA ZHEN JUN WANG Antibacterial cream
Clobetasol propionate and miconazole




Acting upon intelligence, the DH has collected samples of the above-mentioned products from a retail stall in Tuen Mun for analysis. Test results from the Government Laboratory revealed that the above products contained undeclared controlled drug ingredients, which are Part 1 poisons under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138). These products are also suspected to be unregistered pharmaceutical products. The DH, in collaboration with the Police, took enforcement action at the premises today. During the operation, a 51-year-old woman was arrested for suspected illegal sale and possession of Part 1 poisons and unregistered pharmaceutical products. The DH's investigation is still ongoing.

Clobetasol propionate is a steroid substance for treating inflammation. Inappropriate application of steroids could cause skin problems and systemic side effects such as moon face, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, adrenal insufficiency and osteoporosis. Products containing clobetasol propionate are prescription medicines that should be used under a doctor's directions and be supplied in the premises of an Authorized Seller of Poisons (i.e. a pharmacy) under the supervision of a registered pharmacist upon a doctor's prescription. Ketoconazole and miconazole are used for the treatment of fungal infections with side effects including local irritation and sensitivity reactions. Topical products containing ketoconazole and miconazole should be supplied in a pharmacy under the supervision of a registered pharmacist.

According to the Ordinance, all pharmaceutical products must be registered with the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong before they can be sold in the market. Illegal sale or possession of unregistered pharmaceutical products or Part 1 poisons is a criminal offence. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty for each offence is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment.

The DH strongly urged members of the public not to buy or use products of doubtful composition or from unknown sources.

The Honourable Commissioner Cui Jianchun (Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Mr Gary Chan (Legislative Council Member),Ms Starry Lee (Legislative Council Member), Mr Holden Chow (Legislative Council Member), Acting Secretary Lau (Acting Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau), Director Chan (Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan), consuls-general, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is great pleasure to welcome you to this special session of ""The Hong Kong Jockey Club Series: The Great Unity - Civilisation of the Qin and Han Dynasties in Shaanxi Province"" Exhibition.

President Xi Jinping has, on many occasions, made important remarks on strengthening the protection and inheritance of cultural heritage, and promoting China’s magnificent traditional culture. Hong Kong has an important role to play here: deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture and extensively connected to the international communities, we are well positioned as the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange to promote Chinese culture and history to the world and encourage mutual learning across nations and regions.

The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government established the Chinese Culture Promotion Office (CCPO) last year. The CCPO is dedicated to promoting Chinese culture and history-related activities, exchanges and collaborations, thereby enhancing the public’s cultural confidence and national identity. In collaboration with the Hong Kong Museum of History, the CCPO launched in 2024 the first flagship project - the ""General History of China Series"" - for the public to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the development of Chinese civilisation. Last year, the first exhibition in the series, ""The Hong Kong Jockey Club Series: The Ancient Civilisation of the Xia, Shang and Zhou Dynasties in Henan Province"" and the inaugural Chinese Culture Festival have attracted more than 1 million in physical attendance, including 10 000 teachers and students, in the same place that we are standing today.

Following that remarkable success, ""The Hong Kong Jockey Club Series: The Great Unity - Civilisation of the Qin and Han Dynasties in Shaanxi Province"" is the much yearned for second major exhibition in the General History of China Series. Qin and Han, spanning the 440 years from 221 BC to 220 AD, were two dynasties of immense significance. The Qin period saw the first unification of China in terms of adopting: political centralism, the system of prefectures and counties, ""li shu"" as the common written words, common currency, common weights and measures etc. Whereas the Han period saw the defeat of neighbouring and invading foreign tribes, the expansion of the national boundary, the prosperity of external trade via the Silk Road, and the adoption of Confucianism as the orthodox thinking and value etc. These developments profoundly influenced the course of China’s development for over 2,000 years.

The capital of Qin and Western Han was respectively Xianyang and Changan, which are today’s Xianyang and Xi’an in the province of Shaanxi. With the staunch and generous support of the Shaanxi Provincial Cultural Heritage Administration, about 110 sets of priceless exhibits from Shaanxi, including figures from the world-renowned terracotta army of Emperor Qin Shi-huang (ç§¦å§ç), and warrior and animal figurines of Emperor Jing (æ¼¢æ¯å¸), the sixth emperor of Western Han, are presented in this exhibition. Among the exhibits, 11 are grade-one national treasures brought to Hong Kong under the auspices of Shaanxi Province, with four on exhibition outside Mainland China for the first time. We earnestly hope that the wide array of exhibits will give our distinguished guests today a taste of the grandeur of the two dynasties and a deeper appreciation of the richness and beauty of traditional Chinese culture.

I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong SAR and the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong for organising this special viewing session. I look forward to having more exhibitions of national treasures from different Chinese provinces in Hong Kong under the General History of China Series to further introduce Chinese culture and history to the global audience.

In closing, I hope you like the exhibition and have a delightful afternoon meeting the art pieces from 2 000 years ago. Thank you very much."

Upon her arrival yesterday (June 16), Ms Chan first had a meeting with the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Transportation Commission, Mr Yu Fulin, and other officials to exchange views on issues of mutual interest, including traffic management, shipping and aviation. She also visited an all-electric ferry, which commenced operation in April, to learn about Shanghai's progress in promoting green transport.

She subsequently met with representatives of the China Shipowners' Association to give an overview of the latest developments of Hong Kong's maritime services. She encouraged Mainland shipowners and shipping enterprises to register their ships in Hong Kong. Hong Kong ranks fourth globally in shipping registration and the quality of the Hong Kong flag has long been internationally renowned, with its port detention rate consistently among the top three lowest in the world. Additionally, the Government will introduce tax concessions for commodity trading, further generating new impetus for the maritime services sector. Combined with the market influence of Mainland shipowners and the shipping sector, this initiative will reinforce the influence of the country in the international shipping community.

Ms Chan visited the Yangshan Port in Shanghai today (June 17) to gain insights into the operations of its automated terminal. She said, ""The Port of Shanghai and ports in Hong Kong are advancing in unison towards greening, digitalisation and adoption of smart technologies. The visit has deepened exchanges between the two sides on high-quality port development and allowed us to draw on Yangshan Port's experience to facilitate discussions with port operators on a roadmap for the smart transformation of Hong Kong's ports. The Port of Shanghai leverages technology to drive port development, and I look forward to further strengthening exchanges and co-operation with it in the future, consolidating and enhancing Hong Kong's strengths as the 'southern gateway' of the country.""

She continued that Shanghai and Hong Kong are both vital shipping centres to the country, ranking third and fourth respectively in the 2024 Xinhua-Baltic International Shipping Centre Development Index Report. She expressed hope that through this visit and exchanges, both cities can work together to strive toward the country's strategic goal of becoming a maritime powerhouse and explore opportunities for deeper collaboration.

Ms Chan concluded her duty visit to Shanghai and returned to Hong Kong this afternoon."

管浩鳴主席（心連心董事會主席）、彭韻僖律師Melissa（第十四屆全國政協委員）、譚贛蘭教授Annie（心連心學院院長）、范凱傑教授Alex（心連心董事）、各位嘉賓、各位同業、各位社福界的好朋友：

我很高興今天出席由勞福局、社署和心連心聯合舉辦的《香港國安法》公布實施5周年社福界分享會。剛才司儀提到，除了300位現場出席的人士外，線上還有約6 000位朋友一起參與，再一次顯示社福界十分團結，所有關於國情和《香港國安法》，當然還有關於業界的事，大家均會全力參與。

過去數年的發展，尤其是在實施《香港國安法》方面，足足見證我們社福界是其中一個做得最到位、最實際及最好的業界。今年六月三十日將是《香港國安法》在香港特別行政區公布實施5周年，時間過得很快，為響應這個重要日子，做好宣傳教育工作，勞福局及社署聯合社福界推展一系列活動，包括由六月初開始，於社福機構網站及宣傳品等，使用《香港國安法》公布實施5周年宣傳教育活動的主視覺設計key visual，以及在社福服務單位張貼宣傳海報及展示宣傳品，目的是除了管理層和社工外，希望讓前線員工和服務使用者也接觸更多關於《香港國安法》實施的資訊。另外，我跟團隊亦會在六月二十三日，與179間接受我們恆常資助的社福機構一起參觀《香港國安法》公布實施5周年專題展覽及國家安全展覽廳。我期望社福界對《香港國安法》有更深入的認識，並自覺地維護國家安全。

各位也留意到，隨着過去幾年《香港國安法》的實施，社署已將《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》列入受社署資助服務的「服務質素標準」相關文件；亦在服務規格說明書、服務協議、物料供應及採購規定等加入維護國家安全的必要條文，從實際上做好國家安全的工作。此外，在申請舉辦籌款活動包括賣旗等的指引中，均列明大家有責任去維護國家安全。去年十月社署出版的新修訂本《社會福利服務整筆撥款津助手冊》中，當中亦納入對《香港國安法》的要求，確保大家有遵守《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》的責任。不得不提的還有我們於去年完成修訂《社會工作者註冊條例》，進一步完善社會工作者註冊局（註冊局）的管治。在修訂條例修訂後，註冊局積極在維護國安方面進行大量工作，包括建立機制，確保被裁定干犯危害國家安全罪行的人士的社工註冊得到迅速及適當的處理。

在各項優化機制的基礎上，業界不斷提升維護國家安全的意識，並確保在向市民提供日常服務時，恪守維護國家安全的法律和條例。我很高興過去數年我們整體社福界，從頂層的設計到日常運作，均確保大家自覺遵守《香港國安法》的要求，並自覺在日常運作的層面確保做到維護國家安全的責任。

勞福局、社署及心連心持續推廣國家安全教育及宣揚愛國情懷。在過去一年，我們舉辦了多項國安和愛國主義教育相關活動，包括在座很多人也有參與的「二十屆三中全會精神研習班」，有約超過4 800人參與；我們舉辦的國慶社福薈萃晚宴，亦有超過1 000人參與，我也在場見到全場爆滿；與社福機構主席及總幹事參觀國家安全展覽廳，這包括所有179個津助機構；以及剛於四月舉辦的香港社福界維護國家安全研討會，線上線下共有超過8 000人參與，所有活動也彰顯我們社福界在維護國家安全方面的積極性。

社署去年五月推出專項基金，資助營辦津助福利服務的機構進行員工培訓及系統提升，當中特別預留1億元資助機構安排員工參加內地交流團及國情研習課程，加強他們對國家事務的認識。各機構透過專項基金的資助，至今已申請了20項有關認識國家事務、維護國家安全和相關法例及探訪交流的培訓項目。而大家相當熟悉的「香港萬千社工看祖國」交流團，至今已經舉辦了四團，約1 400人曾參與，參加者不單對國家的總體發展得到更深、更全面的了解，亦獲得不少專業上的啓發，並跟內地的同工有更深入的交流。

我自己亦於五月參與「香港大專社工老師看祖國」廣州交流團的首發團，首天我現場出席，這個交流團包括本港全部17所有開辦社工課程的大專機構均有代表參加，顯示學術界亦積極認識和配合我們《香港國安法》方面的工作。

今天研討會內容十分豐富，大會邀請了第十四屆全國政協委員彭韻僖律師，以及心連心董事范凱傑教授，分別與大家就《香港國安法》作主題演講。另外，我們尊敬的心連心學院院長Annie亦會以別開生面的問答遊戲方式，深入淺出地加深大家對《香港國安法》的認識。我相信透過今次的分享會，大家將會對《香港國安法》的內容和認知有更深入的了解並得到啓發。

最後，我藉此機會祝願今日的活動圓滿成功，各位身體健康、工作順利。多謝大家。"

Government announces second batch of projects supported by RAISe+ Scheme,2025-06-17 17:00,2025-06-17 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700543.htm,"The Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) announced today (June 17) the second batch of 25 projects recommended by the Steering Committee of the Research, Academic, and Industry Sectors One-plus (RAISe+) Scheme for funding support by the RAISe+ Scheme. The total funding amounts to over $1 billion.

The projects supported by the Scheme cover a wide range of innovation and technology (I&T) fields, including health and medical sciences, new materials and new energy, AI and robotics, electrical and electronic engineering, advanced manufacturing, Chinese medicine, and computer science/information technology (see Annex). These projects showcase Hong Kong's robust research and development (R&D) capability and the diverse development of its I&T ecosystem.

The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, welcomed the second batch of projects supported by the RAISe+ Scheme. He said, ""The successful approval of the second batch of projects marks the Government's continued commitment to promote commercialisation of local R&D outcomes through the RAISe+ Scheme. The Scheme fosters effective collaboration among the Government, industry, academia and research sectors, injecting new momentum into local innovation and technology development which in turn expedites the development of Hong Kong into an international I&T centre.""

The ITC will continue to work closely with the universities and industry for the smooth implementation of the projects supported by the RAISe+ Scheme, with the aspiration of nurturing more I&T projects and start-ups with potential through the Scheme, thereby further driving Hong Kong's high-quality development.

With a funding allocation of $10 billion, the RAISe+ Scheme was launched in 2023 and aims to fund at least 100 research teams, which are from universities funded by the University Grants Committee and have good potential to become successful start-ups on a matching basis. Funding support from $10 million to $100 million will be provided to each approved project. Assessment criteria include the I&T component of the project, the commercial viability of project outcomes, the technical and management capability of the team, relevance of the project with government policies or in the project's overall interest to the community, as well as the financial considerations of the project. The ITC announced the first batch of 24 projects supported by the RAISe+ Scheme in May 2024 with the total funding amounting to over $1 billion.

Details of the scheme are available on its dedicated website (www.itf.gov.hk/en/raiseplus). For enquiries, please contact the Secretariat of the scheme (Tel: 3655 5678; email: raiseplus@itc.gov.hk)."

與二零二五年二月至四月比較，在二零二五年三月至五月期間，大多數主要經濟行業的失業率（不經季節性調整）均見上升，其中建造業，零售業和地產業有相對明顯的升幅。就業不足率方面，上升主要見於建造業和運輸業。

總就業人數由二零二五年二月至四月的3 677 100人，下跌至二零二五年三月至五月的3 664 700人，減少約12 400人。同期的總勞動人口亦由3 806 500人下跌至3 800 500人，減少約6 000人。

失業人數（不經季節性調整）由二零二五年二月至四月的129 400人上升至二零二五年三月至五月的135 800人，增加約6 400人。同期的就業不足人數亦由47 600人上升至53 600人，增加約6 000人。

評論

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡評論最新失業數字時表示：「相較上一個三個月期間，二零二五年三月至五月經季節性調整的失業率微升0.1個百分點至3.5%。就業不足率亦微升0.1個百分點至1.4%。勞動人口和總就業人數分別進一步減少至3 800 500人和3 664 700人。」

展望未來，孫玉菡說：「在外圍環境持續存在不確定性，以及市民和旅客的消費模式轉變的背景下，不同行業的調整將繼續影響新增職位的速度。此外，未來數月會有新一批畢業生和離校人士投入勞工市場，或會進一步影響整體就業情況。然而，我們欣見香港經濟穩步擴張，今年實質本地生產總值增長預期為2%至3%，而且本地及外來註冊公司數目近月均創新高，反映本地及外地經營者繼續進駐香港市場。這些正面發展應會為勞工市場提供支持及維持香港經濟發展動力。」

進一步資料

失業和就業不足的統計數字，是根據持續進行的「綜合住戶統計調查」結果而編製。

統計調查所採用有關失業及就業不足的定義，緊隨國際勞工組織的建議。當中，就業人口涵蓋所有僱主、自營作業者、僱員（包括全職、兼職及散工等）和無酬家庭從業員。而按行業（或職業）劃分的失業人士是按其以前從事的行業（或職業）劃分。

二零二五年三月至五月的統計調查所用的樣本，是通過一個根據科學方法設計的抽樣系統選出，包括約26 000個住戶，共約68 000人，以代表本港人口的情況。根據這個樣本編製而成的勞工統計數字反映二零二五年三月至五月的移動三個月期間的情況。

Unemployment and underemployment statistics for March - May 2025,2025-06-17 16:30,2025-06-17 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700532.htm,"  According to the latest labour force statistics (i.e. provisional figures for March - May 2025) released today (June 17) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased from 3.4% in February - April 2025 to 3.5% in March - May 2025. The underemployment rate also increased from 1.3% in February - April 2025 to 1.4% in March - May 2025.

  Comparing March - May 2025 with February - April 2025, the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) increased across most major economic sectors, with more distinct increases observed in the construction sector, retail sector and real estate sector. As to the underemployment rate, increases were mainly seen in the construction sector and transportation sector.

  Total employment decreased by around 12 400 from 3 677 100 in February - April 2025 to 3 664 700 in March - May 2025. Over the same period, the labour force also decreased by around 6 000 from 3 806 500 to 3 800 500.

  The number of unemployed persons (not seasonally adjusted) increased by around 6 400 from 129 400 in February - April 2025 to 135 800 in March - May 2025. Over the same period, the number of underemployed persons also increased by around 6 000 from 47 600 to 53 600.

Commentary

  Commenting on the latest unemployment figures, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, said, ""Compared with the preceding three-month period, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate posted a modest uptick of 0.1 percentage point to 3.5% in March - May 2025. The underemployment rate also edged up by 0.1 percentage point to 1.4%. The labour force and total employment decreased further to 3 800 500 and 3 664 700 respectively.""

  Looking ahead, Mr Chris Sun said, ""The pace of job creation will continue to be affected by the evolvement of different industries amidst the continuing uncertain external environment and the changing consumption patterns of locals and visitors. Besides, the entry of fresh graduates and school leavers in the coming few months may further impact the overall employment situation. That said, we are delighted to see the steady expansion of the Hong Kong economy with real Gross Domestic Product in 2025 forecast to grow by 2% to 3%, and the injection of new impetus to the market by local and non-local operators as reflected by the numbers of registered local and foreign companies having reached new heights in recent months. These positive developments should render support to the labour market and sustain the momentum of Hong Kong's economic development.""

Further information

  The unemployment and underemployment statistics were compiled from the findings of the continuous General Household Survey.

  In the survey, the definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment follow closely those recommended by the International Labour Organization. The employed population covers all employers, self-employed persons, employees (including full-time, part-time, casual workers, etc.) and unpaid family workers. Unemployed persons by industry (or occupation) are classified according to their previous industry (or occupation).

  The survey for March - May 2025 covered a sample of some 26 000 households or 68 000 persons, selected in accordance with a scientifically designed sampling scheme to represent the population of Hong Kong. Labour force statistics compiled from this sample represented the situation in the moving three-month period of March to May 2025.

  Data on labour force characteristics were obtained from the survey by interviewing each member aged 15 or over in the sampled households.

  Statistical tables on the latest labour force statistics can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode200.html). More detailed analysis of the labour force characteristics is given in the ""Quarterly Report on General Household Survey” which is published four times a year. The latest issue of the report contains statistics for the quarter January - March 2025 while the next issue covering the quarter April - June 2025 will be available by end August 2025.

This marks Hong Kong's return to the global top three for the first time since 2019.

  WCY 2025 shows that Hong Kong's competitiveness improves significantly, with a total score of 99.2 out of 100 and an increase of 7.7 points, representing the largest increase among the global top 10 economies.

  Among the four competitiveness factors in WCY 2025, Hong Kong rises to second globally in ""Government efficiency"" and ""Business efficiency"". Its respective rankings in ""Economic performance"" and ""Infrastructure"" also improve to sixth and seventh globally. As regards the competitiveness sub-factors, Hong Kong tops the rankings in ""Tax policy"" and ""Business legislation"", and ranks second globally in ""International investment"", ""Education"" and ""Finance"", and third globally in ""International trade"" and ""Management practices"".

  A Government spokesperson said today (June 17), ""Having taken into account a host of factors including objective data and business opinions, the IMD's WCY 2025 has reaffirmed Hong Kong as one of the most competitive economies in the world with a continuous rise in ranking. Hong Kong's scores in overall terms and in many areas have improved in WCY 2025, showing that the HKSAR Government's policy directions are on the right course and that various policies have yielded results. In particular, 'Government efficiency' is ranked second globally, which reflects the inherent excellence and competence of civil servants, and also validates that the change in government culture led by the Chief Executive to drive result-oriented policies has borne fruit. With the efforts of civil servants and the leadership of the governing team, the Government can efficiently deliver results that benefit our people and bring them better livelihoods. In addition, our ranking in 'Business efficiency' also comes second globally, reflecting business leaders' positive views on Hong Kong's competitiveness, as well as Hong Kong's strengths including the rule of law, independent exercise of judicial power, a simple tax system with low tax rates, an efficient and transparent market, a robust financial system, a facilitating business environment aligned with international best practices, and free flow of capital, information, goods and talent, which are affirmed by the business community.""

  The spokesperson stated, ""Hong Kong's economic growth this year is forecast to be 2 per cent to 3 per cent. Against this backdrop, the number of companies registered in Hong Kong reached a new high. Hong Kong is in a period of economic restructuring. Some industries are performing very well, while others, such as the retail and catering industries, are facing challenges. The Government has announced a series of measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises, assisting them in upgrading and transforming, enhancing their brands, and exploring new markets.

  ""In the face of a complicated global economic and political landscape, Hong Kong will understand changes accurately, respond to changes scientifically, and embrace changes proactively. We will continue to actively integrate into the overall national development and align with national development strategies to consolidate our functional role as a 'super connector' and a 'super value-adder', while continuously strengthening our governance systems and governance efficacy. We will strengthen international exchanges and co-operation, expand and deepen regional trade, and explore new markets, with a view to building a vibrant economy, striving for development, and improving people's livelihoods on all fronts. With the staunch support of the country, Hong Kong is poised to achieve higher-quality and more sustainable development."""

「Martin Barnes」獎項由英國土木工程師學會轄下的新工程合約組織頒發，旨在表揚世界各地的工程項目、機構及個別人士，以夥伴協作方式推動工程項目的優秀表現，是業界極具權威的榮譽。

兩項大獎分別是：

1.「氣候變化應對方案」大獎：由水務署石湖墟再造水廠工程項目摘得。在建造及營運香港首座大型區域性再造水廠時，水務署透過新工程合約機制，與承建商共同研究一套創新而具成本效益的全自動再造水生產方案，節能之餘亦有助減碳，而其生產過程更免受極端氣候影響，為北區及鄰近新發展區供應非飲用用途的再造水，不單節省珍貴食水，亦增加本港水資源組合的韌性，進一步提升香港水資源的整體穩定性。

2.「卓越貢獻」大獎：由發展局副秘書長（工務）何英傑摘得，表揚其多年來致力於工程項目推動及深化新工程合約的應用，表現卓越，有效促進業界協作文化，並積極推動運用創新科技，以持續提升工程項目的整體表現。

除上述兩項大獎外，發展局、土木工程拓展署、渠務署、機電工程署和路政署亦憑藉多個標誌性的新工程合約項目獲得不同獎項。

發展局局長甯漢豪祝賀工務團隊取得令人振奮的成績。她說：「發展局及工務部門一直致力透過採用『新工程合約』模式，推動以夥伴協作方式推行工務工程，增強業界不同持份者之間的互信與合作，有助實現項目管理的主要目標，提升項目的管理效率和成本效益。今次獲獎，充分顯示團隊的努力和成果得到國際肯定。」

頒獎禮同日，新工程合約組織亦舉行二○二五年度會議，機電工程署署長潘國英應邀出席專題研討環節，與一眾國際專家交流，分享如何引領業界應用創新技術，融合新工程合約的運用，令基建項目推展更有成效。

「新工程合約」模式自二○○九年由發展局引入香港工務工程以來，已成為推動業界升級轉型的重要引擎。「新工程合約」倡議業主和承建商以夥伴協作精神互動，從而提升工程項目表現。傳統合約較着重在合約條款列明雙方的義務和責任，而「新工程合約」則在合約條款引入一套完整的項目管理系統，包括風險預警機制、合約方之間的補償機制和行動時間表，提倡合約各方以積極協作的態度，攜手按這套管理系統解決合約問題，達致雙贏。至今已有超過760項工務工程項目採用「新工程合約」模式，合約總值超過5,100億港元。"

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-06-17 16:05,2025-06-17 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700599.htm,"An incoming female passenger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (June 17) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the 39-year-old incoming female passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point on May 29 and seized 9 600 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $39,000 and a duty potential of about $32,000 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on June 16 to noon today (June 17), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 235 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

政務司副司長出席銀髮經濟發展聯盟成立典禮暨圓桌會議致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-06-17 15:36,2025-06-17 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/17/P2025061700593.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（六月十七日）出席銀髮經濟發展聯盟成立典禮暨圓桌會議的致辭：

李世榮議員（立法會議員）、陳學鋒議員（立法會議員）、管浩鳴議員（立法會議員）、陳沛良議員（立法會議員）、何啟明副局長（勞工及福利局副局長）、各位顧問、各位嘉賓：

今天很高興出席銀髮經濟發展聯盟（發展聯盟）成立典禮暨圓桌會議。首先，我要恭賀發展聯盟的成立，亦感謝發展聯盟、在座的專家學者、業界領袖及所有參與者，以實際行動支持特區政府在促進銀髮經濟的工作。

高齡化的情況在全球日趨嚴峻，香港的情況更是令人關注。面對人口結構轉變的新形勢，我們必須積極應對高齡化帶來的各種挑戰，並在挑戰中抓緊發展機遇，積極探索新產業、新業態，在變局中打開香港新天地。有見及此，行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》提出成立促進銀髮經濟工作組（工作組），由我及商務及經濟發展局局長分別擔任組長和副組長。經深入探討並與業界及持份者協商後，工作組早前就五大範疇公布了30項措施。

我很高興看到不同業界及持份者對於工作組推出的措施均反應正面，今日成立的發展聯盟正是一個積極回應的好例子。我了解發展聯盟正籌備推廣軟餐、推動餐飲業界採用《照護食標準指引》，以及與餐飲集團、社福機構合作舉辦軟餐食品展等。這些舉措均與工作組在促進「銀色消費」和推廣「銀色品質保證」兩個範疇下推出的措施不謀而合，在便利長者品嚐美食之餘，亦可拉動銀髮族的消費，和以認證方式增加產品和服務的認受性，從而拓展銷售。

除了促進「銀色消費」和推廣「銀色品質保證」，工作組亦在其他三個範疇推出措施，包括發展「銀色產業」、推廣「銀色財務及保障安排」和釋放「銀色生產動力」，目標是發展銀色相關的產品和服務、善用和保障長者的財政資源，以及吸引長者投入勞動市場加強社會的生產力。在推廣「銀色財務及保障安排」方面，我得悉發展聯盟曾約見銀行業，共同探討銀髮金融產品。我樂見在政府推動下，社會重視銀髮經濟的風氣漸成。銀髮經濟的發展不僅關乎長者的福祉，更關乎整個社會的可持續發展。政府需要社會各界的積極協作與行動，才能實現銀髮經濟的最大效益。

我期望工作組能與發展聯盟一同推動各項促進銀髮經濟的工作，發揮加乘作用。我相信，在發展聯盟的帶動下，各界定會繼續推出更多惠及銀髮一族的措施，把握銀髮經濟帶來的機遇，帶動整體經濟發展，並在生活各個範疇提升長者的生活質素，增加他們的獲得感、幸福感。

我再次衷心恭賀發展聯盟的成立，並祝今天的活動圓滿成功，所有參與者都能夠收穫滿滿。

謝謝大家！"

她昨日（六月十六日）抵埗後，先與上海市交通委員會主任于福林一行會面，就雙方關注的議題，包括交通運輸管理、航運、航空等交流意見，並參觀了四月開始營運的純電動渡輪，了解上海綠色交通的推展情況。

她又與中國船東協會代表會面，介紹香港海運服務業的最新發展，並鼓勵內地船東及航運企業把船舶在香港註冊。以船舶註冊地來說，香港全球第四，「香港旗」的品質一直享譽國際，港口滯留率維持在全球三甲之內。另外，特區政府將設立大宗商品貿易稅務優惠，進一步為海運服務業注入動力，結合國家船東及航運業界的市場影響力，助力加強國家在國際航運社區的影響力。

陳美寶今日（六月十七日）到上海洋山港進行考察，了解自動化碼頭的運作。她說：「上海港和香港港口不約而同地朝着綠色化、數字化、智慧化方向發展，是次考察加深了雙方就港口高質量發展的交流，亦讓我們借鏡洋山港的經驗，促進與碼頭營辦商商討香港港口邁向智能化的路線圖。上海港以科技引領港口發展，我期待日後進一步深化與上海港的交流合作，鞏固提升香港作為國家『南大門』的實力。」

她續指，上海和香港同為國家重要的航運中心，在《2024新華．波羅的海國際航運中心發展指數報告》分別位列第三及第四位，期望藉是次交流考察，共同為國家的航運強國戰略目標而努力，探討深化合作的機遇。

陳美寶已結束訪滬行程，並於今日下午返抵香港。"

張博士（香港綠色建築議會主席張天祥博士）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。感謝香港綠色建築議會的邀請，讓我有機會與各位交流，分享香港在推動綠色建築、綠色金融，以及可持續發展方面的最新進展與政策方向。

多年來，香港綠色建築議會一直致力推動本港綠色建築的標準與實踐，提升社會對可持續建築的關注與認知，並為香港這個高度城市化的地區提供具體可行的轉型方案。這些努力不單是建築層面的變革，更是香港邁向二○五○年前實現碳中和目標的重要基石。

綠色發展對金融聲譽至關重要

綠色發展已經不再是選項，而是全球共識。在這個背景下，香港綠色建築議會的工作，不僅有助於減碳，更為香港在國際排名中注入綠色動能。

根據《全球金融中心指數》（GFCI），香港在今年三月公布的最新報告中繼續穩居全球第三位，領先亞太地區。除了傳統金融實力外，環境永續的表現也日益受到重視。報告中納入了多項與綠色建築與排放相關的指標，包括「綠色未來指數」、「能源可持續性指數」以及「可持續城市指數」等，當中涵蓋了LEED（領先能源與環境設計）認證建築數目、人均碳排放、溫室氣體總排放等具體數據。

換言之，綠色建築不僅影響我們的生活質素，也關乎香港作為國際城市的整體競爭力與金融聲譽。

香港綠色資本市場處於領導地位

香港作為國際金融中心，也正積極邁向國際綠色金融中心的目標。根據最新數字，二○二四年在香港安排發行的綠色與可持續債務總額超過840億美元，當中僅綠色與可持續債券就達430億美元，連續七年居亞洲首位，佔地區總額約百分之四十五，充分反映出香港在綠色資本市場的領導地位。

我們自二○一九年推出現今名為「政府可持續債券計劃」，至今，已成功發行合共約2,400億港元的政府綠色債券，所募集的資金分配予多個環保基建與氣候適應項目，其中超過一半屬於綠色建築。我們期望通過提升建築物的可持續發展表現，減少溫室氣體排放，並減緩氣候變化。

為鼓勵更多企業參與綠色融資，我們亦推出了「綠色和可持續金融資助計劃」，截至今年五月，已批出3.4億港元資助，涵蓋超過570筆綠色與可持續債務工具，涉及金額超過1,600億美元。

培養人才與支持科技創新

綠色建築的推動離不開人才與科技的支撐。政府已延長「綠色和可持續金融培訓先導計劃」至二○二八年，資助從業員、學生及專業人士修讀相關課程。至今已批出逾7 200宗申請，資助總額超過4,000萬港元。

同時，我們亦積極推動綠色金融科技的應用。去年，我們推出全新的「綠色和可持續金融科技概念驗證測試資助計劃」，資助初創企業與研究機構開發解決行業痛點的創新方案。首輪計劃已資助39個申請者、共60個項目，每個項目獲資助15萬港元，推動方案的商業化與落地。

與國際接軌推動可持續披露生態圈

上星期，國際財務報告準則基金會（IFRS基金會）確認香港為首批以全面採用國際財務報告可持續披露準則（ISSB準則）為目標的司法管轄區，顯示香港致力提升資本市場就可持續發展的資訊透明度，便利投資者作出投資決策，促進全球資金融通。

一直以來，財庫局致力推動香港建立一個全面、透明、備受國際認可的可持續披露生態圈。去年三月，我們發表了願景宣言，明確表達香港在可持續金融發展方面的長遠目標與堅定決心。其後，香港會計師公會亦已在去年底發布《香港可持續披露準則》，全面銜接ISSB準則，並將於今年八月一日正式生效。

與此同時，我們也公布了《香港可持續披露路線圖》，為大型公眾責任實體在二○二八年前全面採用ISSB準則提供清晰的過渡安排。這些舉措不僅為企業提供明確指引，也進一步鞏固香港作為全球綠色金融領導者的角色；同時亦有助提升企業透明度與國際投資者信心，從而為綠色建築、可持續發展項目創造更多融資機會，加速實現城市低碳轉型與高質量發展。

香港可持續金融分類目錄

為協助業界識別綠色及可持續的經濟活動，並促進相關的資金融通，香港金融管理局（金管局）於去年五月發表「香港可持續金融分類目錄」，當中明確納入了由香港綠色建築議會認證的綠建環評（BEAM Plus）和「零碳就緒建築認證計劃」，推動持份者設定和實行碳中和目標。為協助銀行和業主判斷擬進行的建設或翻新項目是否符合金管局分類目錄標準，香港綠色建築議會推出了「綠色金融分類目錄合格申報服務」，以支持這些綠色金融倡議。

結語

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，建築是城市的骨架，而綠色建築則是我們未來生活質素的保障。香港的綠色金融發展與綠色建築推動息息相關，兩者相輔相成。透過政府和業界的協作，我們有信心香港不單止繼續在國際舞台上鞏固其國際金融中心的地位，更能成為綠色城市的典範，為我們的下一代建構一個可持續、更宜居的家園。謝謝大家。"
