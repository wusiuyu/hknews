CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-02-01 02:34,2026-02-01 02:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/01/P2026020100075.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (February 1) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-02-01 02:34,2026-02-01 02:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/01/P2026020100074.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月一日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-31 17:30,2026-01-31 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/31/P2026013100377.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月三十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-31 17:30,2026-01-31 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/31/P2026013100373.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 31), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
一名入境旅客處理未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2026-01-31 17:00,2026-01-31 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/31/P2026013100581.htm,"​一名入境男旅客因處理未完稅香煙以及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（一月三十一日）在西九龍裁判法院被判處監禁五個月，以及罰款一千五百元。

海關人員昨日（一月三十日）在香港國際機場截查一名四十三歲的抵港男旅客，並在他的個人行李內檢獲約四萬五千支未完稅香煙，估計市值約十八萬六千元，應課稅值約十五萬元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/tc/）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2026-01-31 17:00,2026-01-31 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/31/P2026013100584.htm,"​An incoming male passenger was sentenced to 5 months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (January 31) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming male passenger, aged 43, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (January 30), and seized about 45 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $186,000 and a duty potential of about $150,000, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
政務司副司長出席「樂齡消費一站通」啓動禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-01-31 16:45,2026-01-31 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/31/P2026012700695.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（一月三十一日）出席「樂齡消費一站通」啓動禮的致辭：

陳錦榮主席（消費者委員會主席）、米雪姐（星級嘉賓）、Maggie（商務及經濟發展局常任秘書長黃少珠）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位在此觀看活動的市民：

  大家好！今天非常高興，與大家一同見證消費者委員會（消委會）的「樂齡消費一站通」正式啓動。

香港到二○四六年將進入人口高齡化的高峰期，屆時超過三成人口年齡都在65歲或以上。隨着人口高齡化，銀髮經濟相關的產品和服務會不斷增加。長者在不同的消費範疇有很大的潛力，例如飲食、健康護理等。特區（香港特別行政區）政府和社會各界必須未雨綢繆，既要回應長者日常生活和消費上的需要，亦要把握銀髮經濟帶來的新機遇。

要將機遇化為成果，有賴多方面的合作。特區政府在二○二四年成立「促進銀髮經濟工作組」，並在去年五月就五個範疇提出30項措施，五個範疇分別是促進「銀色消費」、發展「銀色產業」、推廣「銀色品質保證」、推廣「銀色財務及保障安排」和釋放「銀色生產動力」。行政長官亦在去年施政報告中，公布成立「社會高齡化對策工作組」，由我出任組長，成員包括政府全部15個政策局，探討如何善用社會資源和市場力量，推動跨界別合作，並與政府政策措施發揮協同作用，以制定適合對應高齡化的措施。

促進「銀色消費」的其中一項重要工作，是保障年長消費者的權益。消委會在香港家傳戶曉，在這方面的工作是舉足輕重、無出其右。今天正式推出的「樂齡消費一站通」，是消委會就保障年長消費者權益的工作的一項重要里程碑。平台的內容十分豐富多元：一方面結合不同種類產品和服務的資料，讓長者、其家人和照顧者，透過簡單易用的介面，輕鬆找到可靠的資訊和合適的消費選擇；另一方面，平台亦會適時發放消費提示，提高銀髮一族「精明消費」的意識。

在此，我呼籲社會各界，在推出產品和服務時，積極加入銀髮經濟元素，讓年長消費者可享有更多元化的選擇。同時，我亦希望各界貫徹「樂齡消費一站通」的理念，向銀髮一族提供的資訊，能夠切合他們的喜好和需求之餘，同時也是準確及時、簡單易明，讓銀髮一族可以緊貼市埸產品和服務的資訊，放心消費。

我衷心感謝消委會及各位合作夥伴的努力。讓我們一起連結各界的力量，共同促進「銀髮消費」。馬年在即，我在此恭祝各位在馬年工作也好、事業也好，一馬當先、一馬平川。多謝大家。"

大家好！我很榮幸出席今天的「心連大地攝影會陳俊濠永遠榮譽會長攝影藝術暨會員作品展」開幕典禮。

正如司儀所說，濠哥是我很好的朋友。他最令我尊敬的，不單只是他卓越的攝影藝術，還有他的為人，和他做朋友是一流的。他也是很愛國的，所以我對他非常尊重。他所舉辦的展覽，無論舉辦多少次我都會來。已故的陳俊濠會長曾經說過，「攝影是藝術，也是橋樑」。同樣是攝影愛好者的我，深感認同這句說話。就好像今天展出的每一幅作品一樣，不單止記錄了山河美景，也見證了發展的歷程、人民的生活。每一個鏡頭下的畫面，其實都好像一座橋樑，連繫着人與人、心與心。

心連大地攝影會自二○○九年成立以來，始終秉持「愛國愛港，以影會友，回饋社會」的宗旨，用鏡頭表達愛國之心，用行動貢獻社會。

你們透過記錄真實影像，讓更多人認識祖國、親近祖國，更透過慈善攝影展，帶動社會支持內地公益項目，正如會長所說，他們做了很多很多的工夫。匯聚社會愛心，真正體現了愛國者的情懷。在這裏，我衷心感謝你們的付出與努力。

推動愛國主義教育，是本屆特區（香港特別行政區）政府其中一項重要工作。我一直相信，愛國精神，需要在心中播種，以真情灌溉，才能生根發芽、茁壯成長。

正所謂「潤物細無聲」，要把愛國主義教育做好做強，便要將它融入市民生活、觸動人心，而跨越言語、直達情感的藝術創作，正正是承載愛國精神的重要方式。

香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心，政府一直積極推動文化藝術和人文交流合作。我期望這次攝影作品展，不單止讓大家看見鏡頭下的美景，更能成為一座「心橋」，成為促進交流的起點，啓發更多更多的合作。

Remarks by S for Health at media session on Medical Council of Hong Kong,2026-01-31 15:55,2026-01-31 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/31/P2026013100489.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, at a media session after attending a radio programme this morning (January 31):

Reporter: On review of the Medical Council's complaint system, has your Bureau identified any issues that led to delays in dealing with complaints so far, and in what ways would the Bureau deal with such issues to ensure fair and timely trials at the Council? Thank you.

Secretary for Health: We take it very seriously about the recent incidents about the delay in the handling of all these complaint cases and disciplinary hearings. We have requested the Medical Council (Medical Council of Hong Kong) to provide us with the review of the mechanism and provide us with some suggestions and recommendations for the areas of improvement. At the same time, after we received the Medical Council's review, we also sought additional information. We are going through the Medical Council's review report as well as the additional information. We have certainly identified some areas that have to be addressed and improved. These involve certain areas which may require the amendment of the Medical Registration Ordinance. The Medical Council's hearing, in a way, is a judicial procedure, and the handling of all these complaint cases is between the complainants and the defendants, so it has to make sure the procedural justice. But sometimes there is delay because of allowing sufficient and reasonable time for both sides to provide information. One potential delay is in seeking expert reports. It is because all these complaint cases involve medical procedures and the opinion from experts on particular areas, especially for certain complicated medical procedures, requires time. The delay caused by this will certainly not be addressed by the amendment of the Medical Registration Ordinance, so we have to look into the details and address all these pressure points and delays, so that we will ensure that similar cases will not happen again. We are looking into every area including an amendment of the Medical Registration Ordinance which we will be submitting to the LegCo (Legislative Council) - first of all, to the Panel on Health Services for a discussion in February and then possibly submitting the amendment to the LegCo in April this year.

​醫務衞生局局長會見傳媒談公營醫療收費改革和醫委會,2026-01-31 15:55,2026-01-31 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/31/P2026013100488.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（一月三十一日）上午出席電台節目後會見傳媒的談話內容：

醫務衞生局局長：早晨，我想首先談公營醫療收費改革。急症室的數據非常清楚顯示，醫療收費改革對我們關切的「貧、急、重、危」四類病人當中的急症類（危殆／危急）的病人有很大改革意義，令真正危急的病人在急症室可得到更好的治療。另一方面，對真正有醫療需要而經濟方面有困難的市民，其實減免制度亦能幫助他們，從以往每年約14 000名，現時最新數字已增加至約12萬名，一個月之內已有約12萬人成功申請，包括有五萬多人獲批最長18個月的減免，有足夠的證明文件，另外一些未有足夠的證明文件，我們都批出臨時三個月減免，這能幫到一些有經濟需要的人士。至於另一重保障，「一萬元封頂」方面，今日剛過推行收費改革的30日「滿月」，已有第一個較重症的病人，非常不幸，一直在醫院需要接受治療，已用了超過一萬元，而其收費由達到一萬元當日開始，所有的費用已獲豁免，這對全香港750萬市民是一個很大的保障，無須經濟審查，但仍需病人作申請，確保其不是基於非醫學原因接受治療。

記者：想問醫委會改革審訊延誤的原因，以及你如何看外界認為要新加入一些業外委員﹖就黎生黎太的小朋友腦癱案，初步調查是否覺得醫生有責任﹖

醫務衞生局局長：醫委會（香港醫務委員會）的功能其實並不只在於投訴和紀律聆訊，它是一個法定機構，負責醫生註冊、兩間醫學院，以至未來第三間醫學院課程是否符合標準、執業試的執行、有限度註冊、特別註冊，以至醫生守則和健康狀況是否適合執業等，這是很複雜的功能，很多方面需要有專業知識，所以貿然純粹因為投訴和紀律聆訊而減少醫生委員和增加非業內委員，對醫委會並不是一個很好的處理方法。就投訴個案的延誤，並不是牽涉醫生委員做了甚麼，很多是有不同的延誤原因，從被投訴醫生的角度，延誤亦為他們帶來很大損傷，許多被投訴的醫生都不想有延誤，因為每次有投訴後，該醫生在許多方面都會受到影響和掣肘，他們大都想盡快釐清責任問題，到底有錯還是沒有錯，都要有一個判決，其實是還雙方公道，亦希望市民明白，處理投訴過程需要有專家意見。

在處理投訴和紀律聆訊方面，除了32個醫務委員會成員外，其實醫委會設有審裁員，而無論初步偵訊委員會，還是研訊小組，其成員不單在32個醫務委員會的委員內挑選，另外是有一些審裁員的。審裁員現時包括48位醫生和36位非業界成員，他們由不同機構提名，包括非業界的委員，有香港律師會、香港大律師公會、香港會計師公會，以至社會服務團體等，每一個提名六個人，這些都是負責在偵訊委員會和研訊小組評定醫生有沒有專業失德的行為，所以這個審裁員的制度，其實已經能夠處理大家關注有否業外人士在研訊過程中參與。初步偵訊委員會的組成是四名醫生和三名業外委員（／審裁員），而研訊小組的組成是三名醫生和兩名業外委員（／審裁員），兩者都有業外委員（／審裁員）參與，至於如何繼續優化這過程，在今次的法例修訂中，我們會充分去考慮。

記者：有關公營醫療收費改革，昨日有議員提到在加價幅度上未必有充分諮詢立法會，經過之前公營殮房收費作了改動，收費改革現時已過了30日「滿月」，在過程中，是否認為收費幅度和各種安排已反映社會各界的意見﹖

醫務衞生局局長：公營醫療收費改革中醫管局（醫院管理局）的收費是根據醫管局的條例，也是既往十多年來都是兩年檢討一次，只不過很多時候檢討後沒有改動，所以市民會覺得為甚麼我們現在才提出兩年，其實這是既有的機制。檢討收費已經考慮了很多的不同因素，我們在檢討之後提出的方案時，有諮詢不同的委員。這次我們看到收費改革落地30天、一個月，剛剛「滿月」，數據顯示已初步達致到我們的目標，正如我剛才講，急症室對急症方面有明顯改善，亦是我們的方向，能夠令公共資源得到更好的運用。至於「貧」方面，我剛才的數字亦顯示，更多人能夠在減免機制得到幫助，我們預計「一萬元封頂」亦對一些重症病人有幫助。另外，在危疾方面，如癌症病人，他們現在有些自費的藥物，我們亦希望通過今次的收費改革給予他們一重保障。已經有些例子，就是一些癌症病人，舉例，同事跟我說，一個肺癌病人本身是一個二人家庭，其收入不是很充裕，但是這些藥物在以往的制度下，病人每年要付差不多四萬元，但是在新收費制度下，豁免的程度提高，資助額高了，自付的費用只要數千元，對病人而言，是一個很大的幫助。這些就是我們在改革做到的事情，希望令這些貧困、急症、重病，以及危疾的病人，可以得到更精準的資助。

"S for S encourages graduates to fulfil duties with ""iron will, compassion and insights"" (with photos)",2026-01-31 13:28,2026-01-31 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/31/P2026013100336.htm,"The Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, inspected the passing-out parade of 15 probationary inspectors and 248 recruit police constables at the Hong Kong Police College today (January 31) and witnessed them embark to perform the sacred duties of the Police.

Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Tang said that while times and circumstances, criminal modus operandi and investigative methods are ever-changing, the mission of the Police, their loyalty towards the country and Hong Kong, their determination to safeguard the rule of law, and their pledge to serve the community stand firm and unaltered. He said that police officers, facing various unknowns and challenges daily, should embody three capabilities: ""iron will, compassion and insights"".

 ""Iron will"" - when confronted with threats and pressure, police officers should remain dedicated and unwavering, committed to resolutely safeguarding national security and upholding the rule of law in Hong Kong. He mentioned that in 2019, many Force members, despite being attacked by rioters and their family members being threatened, remained unyielding and steadfast at their posts, which demonstrated their impregnable ""iron will"".

 ""Compassion"" - Police officers should enforce the law with impartiality and integrity, while also being compassionate, empathetic and citizen-oriented. He cited that in the aftermath of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, officers searched for the deceased at the devastating fire scene with their bare hands, striving to keep the bodies intact and recover their identity so their families could bid a proper farewell. ""Compassion"" is embodied through respecting life, being empathetic for suffering, and upholding professionalism.

 ""Insights"" - In the face of evolving criminal modus operandi and the volatile external environment, police officers should cultivate the ability to foresee opportunities, plan ahead and break new ground. He stated that the Force must leverage new technologies, fresh knowledge and innovative thinking, collaborate across sectors and embrace change. To be future-ready, the Force should possess the insights to identify and adapt to changes, with the devotion to consciously serve the country, the wisdom to uphold principles while pursuing innovation, and the vision to stay vigilant even in times of peace.

Mr Tang said that the Force never stands alone, for it is supported by the staunch backing of the motherland, various departments of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and all sectors of society. He said he endeavours to safeguard Hong Kong alongside police officers.

保安局局長勉勵學員以「鐵骨、仁心、慧眼」履行職責（附圖）,2026-01-31 13:25,2026-01-31 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/31/P2026013100330.htm,"保安局局長鄧炳強今日（一月三十一日）出席香港警察學院結業會操，檢閱15名見習督察及248名學警，見證他們正式開始履行警察的神聖職責。

鄧炳強致辭時說，時代和環境在變，犯罪模式和查案方式亦在變，不變的是警察的使命、對國家和香港的忠誠、維護法治的決心，以及服務社會的承諾。他指，警務人員每日面對很多未知和挑戰，需具備「鐵骨、仁心、慧眼」三個要素。

「鐵骨」——警務人員面對威脅和壓力依然恪盡職守、絕不退縮，守護國家安全及香港法治。他提到二○一九年時，很多警隊同袍為守護香港，即使被暴徒襲擊、家人受威嚇，依然寸步不讓、緊守崗位，正是展現堅不可摧的「鐵骨」。

「仁心」——警務人員鐵面無私，執法剛正，但亦要有溫度，將心比己、以民為本。他舉例說，早前大埔宏福苑火災後，人員在環境惡劣的災場內徒手挖掘，力求保持遺體完整，為逝者找回身分，讓家人可以好好道別，正是實踐尊重生命、共情苦難、持守專業的「仁心」。

「慧眼」——警務人員面對層出不窮的犯罪手法和變幻莫測的外圍環境，需能洞察先機、超前部署、敢於破局。他指，警隊要善用新科技、新知識、新思維，協同各方力量，積極求變。警隊面向未來，需具備識變應變的「慧眼」，有自覺服務國家大局的擔當、守正創新的智慧和居安思危的遠見。

鄧炳強指，警隊從不孤單，因背後有強大祖國、特區政府各部門及社會各界的堅實力量支持；他仍然與警務人員並肩守護香港，一起奮鬥。

最後，他引用國家主席習近平的話，指維護國家安全和社會穩定，守護人民幸福和安寧，是人民警察的神聖職責。他勉勵學員秉持「鐵骨為魂，仁心為本，慧眼為導」，實踐「心有所信，方能行遠」的理念，履行警隊「忠誠勇毅、心繫社會」的使命。"
