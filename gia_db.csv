食環署一直致力提供有效率而莊嚴得體的火葬服務。署方的服務承諾是在申請人提出申請翌日起計的十五天內能提供火化時段，而署方過去多年均完全達到上述服務承諾的標準。目前，由明日（十一月十一日）至十一月二十五日期間，在不同火葬場合共有約350節火化時段可供市民預約。申請人可於任何時間透過網上預約，或在辦公時間親身提交申請。基本上每宗預約申請均可即時獲編配火化時段，沒有出現任何申請人不獲編配十五天內火化時段的個案。

不同日子和火葬場的服務需求有所不同。一般而言，假日及位於市區火葬場的火化時段需求較大。食環署一直密切留意火化時段的整體供應，令申請人在相關的十五天期間有火化時段預約。

食環署近年積極提升各項殯葬服務的水平。舉例而言，食環署已推出「墳場及火葬場服務平台」（服務平台）（app.fehd.gov.hk/ccsp），簡化電子申請程序及提供個人化服務。市民可透過服務平台提交所有由署方管理的墳場及火葬場服務的申請，包括火葬服務、公眾骨灰龕位編配、墳場服務、綠色殯葬、流產胎火化或安放、免費海上追思活動及建立「無盡思念」網站（預早規劃篇）。

海關人員於十一月八日和十一月九日在落馬洲支線管制站分別截查一名三十八歲抵港男旅客及一名四十五歲抵港女旅客。海關人員在該名男旅客所攜帶的個人行李內檢獲六千零一十二支未完稅香煙，估計市值約二萬四千六百元，應課稅值約一萬九千八百元。另外，海關在該名女旅客的個人行李內檢獲二千九百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約一萬二千二百元，應課稅值約九千八百元。該兩名旅客隨即被捕。

該名男旅客今日就違反《條例》被法庭判處監禁六星期和罰款四千元，而該名女旅客被判監禁四星期零六日。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Customs officers intercepted a 38-year-old incoming male passenger on November 8 and a 45-year-old incoming female passenger on November 9 at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point. Customs officers seized 6 012 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $24,600 and a duty potential of about $19,800, from the male passenger's personal baggage. In addition, 2 981 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $12,200 and a duty potential of about $9,800, were seized from the female passenger's personal baggage. They were subsequently arrested.

The male passenger was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and fined $4,000, while female passenger was sentenced to four weeks and six days' imprisonment, by the court today for contravening the DCO.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."

記者：首先問旅遊界方面，現時只在馬會做了一年多的江旻憓成功參選。她早前向選舉主任提交關於密切聯繫的申述，選舉主任之後有否與她的公司——即是馬會核證相關的內容？有沒有與業界進一步了解她與旅遊業的關係？或根據她單方面的陳述而作出裁定？提名顧問委員會有沒有給予意見？另一個問題，上屆立法會提名期結束後，用了七日時間確認選舉候選人的資格，今屆只用四日，這麼快是否因為趕着舉辦選舉論壇？現時不少候選人有其他地區公職，例如區議員、三會、關愛隊等，會否擔心他們在選舉期間，又或者日後當選後很難分身去履行這些職務以及很難完成市民的期望？會否建議他們辭去這些公職，集中立法會的工作？

政務司司長：首先，每一個候選人，即161位候選人已經過審核，他們是完全符合參選的資格。161位人士均（符合資格）參選。當然，我們不會評論個別個案。

在審核中，所有參選人均會遞交一份申請表格，選舉主任在看過後，若認為他是符合資格，便會把他的意見提交資審會（候選人資格審查委員會）作出審核，再根據具體情況評核他是否符合資格，所以我想再重申一次，所有161位參選人士，他們均符合資格，其資格亦都被確定。

每次選舉時，我們都希望資格審核的工作能夠盡快完成。為甚麼要盡快完成？因為希望可給予更多時間讓候選人盡快展開選舉工程，目的希望讓選民能夠有更多和充分的時間了解每一位候選人的政綱、抱負和貢獻，在投票日時可以作出一個適合的選擇。

每一次我們均盡快完成，事實上，並非到截止才做，每次收到（提名）時均盡快去做。161份的提名中，絕大部分在（再）上星期已經遞交，我們一直都在做這方面的工作。當完成時，我們就盡快馬上公布。

所有立法會議員，如果他有另一份工作，要懂得分配時間，當然要以不影響立法會工作為目的，候選人如果將來成為立法會議員時，他應該要好好分配時間。

記者：你好。想問為甚麼不等待候選人通過資格審查才抽籤？是否時間緊迫？亦想問有團體在立法會選舉當日提供優惠，例如只要持有投票心意卡前往餐廳便會有折，想問這些行為會否觸犯法例？會否犯法呢？謝謝。

政務司司長：其實抽籤和資格審查是沒有一個必然的先後次序的。事實上，上一屆都是一樣，抽了籤才公布資格審查的結果。其實抽籤的主要目的是希望盡早方便候選人作好選舉工程的準備。這很重要，因為有時候他們說，如果知道了候選人編號，都可以早些印製宣傳品、擬定稿件，節省一點時間，我們覺得這是合理的。當然我們也提醒過他們，在未曾公布資格審查（結果）時，最好不要用這編號，要等他們資格審查通過了才用。但作好準備，我們覺得是沒有問題的。一切的做法都是方便他們盡早做好選舉工程、方便市民和選民盡早了解他們的政綱，這是我們的目標。

至於我們常常說，希望鼓勵香港的合資格選民去投票，我很多謝很多公營或私營企業都很支持政府的工作，提供很多便利給其員工。我也很多謝他們的支持，也很多謝他們提供便利。因為的而且確，有些員工因為要上班或其他原因投不到票，如果僱主可以提供便利，我覺得這是好事。其實在選舉上，剛才你提到會不會有犯法的問題，其實法例上在選舉條例中很清楚寫明哪些犯法，哪些不犯法。其實最主要的一點是你提供甚麼優惠、甚麼便利措施也好，你不可以叫他投某一個候選人；你沒有提議的話，就沒有問題。例如，你投了票，我就會讓你放假，而不是你投某一個候選人才可以放假，這個當然在法律上有很明確的規定。所以，再一次多謝社會上大家都很支持，大家一起同心合力做好這次選舉，讓我們想投票的市民、選民，能夠很方便、很順利地投票，這目的就是我們想達到的。

記者：想問選舉論壇安排方面，因為有些候選人透露，原先剛過去的周末應要開始舉行選舉論壇，但就因為某些原因而需要押後。想問是否因為一些資格審查意外地用了較多的時間？或為何會有此時間安排上的失誤？第二條想問公眾質疑某些候選人跟業界的聯繫。會否擔心這些質疑的聲音會影響公眾對於今次選舉的信心或認受性的問題？

政制及內地事務局局長：首先回應你的問題，關於你說選舉論壇的時間是延誤或失誤，這個我不同意。其實我們這個論壇一直都在籌備當中，當然在籌備過程裏面，我們很多時候要了解一下候選人的時間，看看甚麼時間方便，還有我們有很多場地上、各方面的安排，其實我們一直以來都在積極籌備中。未曾正式敲定安排之前，我們都沒有正式發出通知去邀請候選人或者選民去出席。所以到現在整個安排上，我們是敲定了，我們今天就正式向大家公布那個情況，以至在稍後時間會有新聞公布正式發給大家，包括那些安排詳情，讓大家知道，我們才會正式邀請候選人及相關的選民出席論壇。

政務司司長：我回答你最後一條問題，就是關於參選人的資格問題。其實在資格審查委員會，我們很嚴謹地按照法例，對每一位候選人的資格進行審查。我再重申，161位候選人的資格是得到認可、認同。另外，我亦想大家明白，香港的選舉制度非常公平、公正。每一位選民進入投票站投票的時候，都是百分之一百為其個人意願，他投哪一位是個人意願。所以候選人將來當選時，也是選民的選擇，也是一個很自由的選擇。所有（選民）投了哪一位，是絕對保密的。我相信，就我們的選舉制度來說，我不覺得其認受性會有懷疑。

Speech by SFST at Accounting and Financial Reporting Council Regional Regulatory Forum Dinner Reception (English only),2025-11-10 20:05,2025-11-10 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/10/P2025111000701.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council Regional Regulatory Forum Dinner Reception today (November 10):

David (Chairman of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council (AFRC), Dr David Sun), Janey (Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of the AFRC, Ms Janey Lai), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is my honour to join you all tonight at this dinner reception. First of all, I extend a warm welcome to all guests who have gathered here from near and far. Your presence and active participation in this forum send a strong message of confidence and firm support for Hong Kong's capital markets, reflecting the deep trust placed in our city as a leading international financial centre.

Hong Kong's accounting profession underpins its position as a global financial hub, with a robust and highly regulated community of practitioners. There were over 48 000 certified public accountants, of whom around 5 000 held practicing certificates authorising them to sign auditors' reports, at end of October this year. Supporting this talent pool are approximately 1 200 registered audit firms and 700 corporate practices overseen by the AFRC. This strong professional infrastructure not only ensures rigorous financial oversight but also enhances Hong Kong's competitive edge in cross-boundary wealth management and international capital markets.

This evening is not only a celebration of dedication and expertise but an opportunity to reflect on the pressing issues that shape the future of our financial markets and profession. Over the course of today's fruitful discussions, we have explored critical aspects of governance that help to build trust and strengthen the resilience of our capital markets. These conversations remind us of the vital role that robust frameworks and ethical leadership play in sustaining market integrity and investor confidence.

Sustainability reporting in Hong Kong

Equally prominent were the dialogues on sustainability disclosure, emphasising how stakeholder engagement is essential to cultivating transparent and reliable reporting. As Hong Kong intensifies its commitment to sustainable finance, clear and meaningful communication remains fundamental to driving real progress and fostering trust from our investors. On this front, we introduced the ""Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong"" last December. This initiative aims to guide key public interest entities toward full adoption of the International Sustainability Standards Board Standards by 2028, establishing a consistent global framework for sustainability reporting.

  The AFRC has played a significant role in promoting sustainability assurance. The AFRC's forthcoming public consultation on a proposed local regulatory framework for sustainability assurance represents an important step forward, underscoring our dedication to aligning Hong Kong's regulations with global standards and advancing the profession's development.

The forum has also highlighted quality challenges that the accounting and auditing sectors face in pursuit of long-term sustainability. Maintaining high professional standards is the backbone of our industry's credibility, and addressing these challenges requires continuous vigilance, innovation, and collaboration. Another interesting topic covered at the forum was the profound impact of technological breakthroughs, especially artificial intelligence (AI), on accounting and auditing practices. The AI revolution presents both extraordinary opportunities and complex risks. Navigating this new landscape demands that we adapt our skills, frameworks, and regulatory approaches to ensure that technology enhances confidence in financial reporting.

Hong Kong's strategic response

Hong Kong stands ready to meet these challenges head-on. We recognise that strengthening governance, improving disclosure as well as embracing innovation are not standalone goals but interconnected efforts vital for our sustained success as an international financial centre. Hong Kong has consistently benefited from strong national backing and extensive global connections. Through sustained efforts to enhance our financial infrastructure, Hong Kong has secured the top position in the Infrastructure pillar of the Global Financial Centres Index 38. These achievements demonstrate the confidence investors have in our financial markets and further solidify Hong Kong's position as a key ""super connector"" linking Chinese Mainland with international markets.

Building on our strong regulatory foundations, we continue to refine policies to improve transparency and accountability, while embracing the major trends, such as fintech and green finance, to keep pace with the development of the market. For instance, we are proactively seizing the vast potential of fintech by building on the momentum of Project Ensemble, which facilitates live trading of tokenised assets and standardising the issuance of tokenised bonds.

The AFRC has a crucial part to play, which expertise, diligence, and integrity underpin the trust that global investors place in our markets. As new technologies reshape workflows and new sustainability expectations redefine disclosure norms, the role of the AFRC will grow even more indispensable in safeguarding the reliability of our financial ecosystem.

Hong Kong's future as a premier financial hub depends on our ability to merge tradition with innovation, uphold rigorous quality standards, and promote open engagement between all market participants. The insights shared today will guide us in thinking deeper about professional development agendas, ensuring that Hong Kong continues to offer a world-class platform for capital formation.

In closing, let me express my excitement to the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council for convening this important forum. My sincere thanks to all speakers, panelists, and attendees for your commitment to advancing excellence in governance, sustainability, quality, and technology within accounting and finance. Let tonight be an occasion to strengthen our connections, inspire new ideas, and renew our shared dedication to building a trusted and forward-looking financial market.

Last but not least, I encourage all financial market participants to actively participate in the coming Legislative Council General Election on December 7 by casting your votes. It is of utmost importance for accelerating the development of Hong Kong's economy and our markets. Thank you."
衞生防護中心調查一宗懷疑與草酸鈣針晶體有關的食物中毒個案,2025-11-10 19:40,2025-11-10 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/10/P2025111000749.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十日）正調查一宗懷疑進食野生芋頭而中毒的個案，並提醒市民切勿食用自行採摘的野生植物，以免因誤食含草酸鈣針晶體的蔬菜而中毒。

個案涉及一名54歲女子，她昨日（十一月九日）在家中進食野生芋頭後，隨即出現咀唇腫脹和喉嚨痛。她同日到博愛醫院急症室求診，需留院治療，現時情況穩定。臨床診斷為懷疑草酸鈣針晶體中毒。

初步調查顯示，病人的家人在元朗新田一個花圃採摘野生芋頭，她在家自行烹煮食用，其家人未有食用。中心調查仍在繼續。

芋頭是配製菜式和甜品的常用食材。然而，一些外形近似芋頭的植物（如海芋）含有毒素，包括草酸鈣針晶體。誤食含草酸鈣針晶體的植物會刺傷和刺激皮膚及黏膜，如舌頭、口腔與咀唇麻痺和灼熱，以及舌頭或咀唇腫脹。進食意外混有含草酸鈣針晶體植物的蔬菜亦可能引致食物中毒。

在進食蔬菜或芋頭時，市民應留意以下事項：


切勿採食野生植物；
從可靠的供應商購買蔬菜或芋頭；及
取走混雜在食用蔬菜中的其他植物，並在煮食前徹底洗淨蔬菜。


​市民可參閱食物環境衞生署食物安全中心有關「慎防誤食海芋中毒」，以及「與草酸鈣有關的食物中毒」網頁，了解詳情和健康建議。"
CHP investigates suspected food poisoning case related to calcium oxalate raphide,2025-11-10 19:40,2025-11-10 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/10/P2025111000751.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (November 10) investigating a case of suspected food poisoning caused by eating wild taro and reminded the public not to consume self-picked wild plants in order to avoid poisoning by accidental consumption of vegetables containing calcium oxalate raphide.

 The case involves a 54-year-old woman who developed swollen lips and a sore throat shortly after consuming wild taro at home yesterday (November 9). She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Pok Oi Hospital on the same day and was admitted for treatment. She is now in stable condition. The clinical diagnosis was suspected calcium oxalate raphide poisoning.

 Preliminary investigations revealed that the patient's family member picked wild taro from a flower bed in San Tin, Yuen Long. She cooked and consumed it at home, while her family members did not eat it. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

 Taro is a popular ingredient used in dishes and desserts. However, some plants look like taro (e.g. giant alocasia) but contain toxins, including calcium oxalate raphide. Accidental consumption of plants containing calcium oxalate raphide can cause stinging and irritation of the skin and mucous membranes, such as numbness and a burning sensation of the tongue, mouth and lips, and swelling of the tongue and lips. Consumption of vegetables accidentally mixed with calcium oxalate raphide-containing plants may also cause food poisoning.

 Members of the public should take heed of the following when consuming vegetables or taro:


Do not pick and consume wild plants;
Purchase vegetables or taro from reliable suppliers; and
Remove any plants mixed with edible vegetables for consumption and wash them thoroughly before cooking.

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-11-10 19:20,2025-11-10 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/10/P2025111000737.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (November 10) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From November 2 to 8, the CHP recorded two imported and one community-acquired LD cases. The two imported cases are epidemiologically linked and all three patients involved had underlying illnesses.

  The first two cases involve a 74-year-old male patient and a 63-year-old female patient who are family members living together. During their incubation periods, the patients joined a package tour to Tianjin and Beijing from October 26 to 30. Investigations revealed that these two cases are epidemiologically linked and are classified as imported cases. The CHP is proactively contacting individuals who joined the same package tour in order to provide assessments and medical surveillance. The CHP has reported the cases to the health authority of the Chinese Mainland.

  The remaining case is a community-acquired case, involving a 58-year-old male patient living in Sha Tin District.

  The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure.

  As of November 8, 140 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

  Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

  Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

  Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

â
  âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-10 18:50,2025-11-10 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/10/P2025111000690.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月十日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得59宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，三宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，近期基孔肯雅熱疫情呈持續下降趨勢。過去一周（十一月二日至八日）廣東省新增107宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十月二十六日至十一月一日）的259宗顯著下降。上周個案主要分布在深圳市（30宗）、江門市（23宗）、佛山市（21宗）及珠海市（10宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應葵青區近期錄得一宗本地個案，中心人員已進行風險評估，並和有關地區的關愛隊向曉峰園和附近的居民、葵涌廣場及上環信德中心一帶超過10 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的單張，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

由十一月三日至今日下午五時，中心透過各醫護站、熱線電話及於區內進行上門探訪和問卷調查，已為超過14 000名在較高風險地區居住或工作的市民進行評估，並為當中14名出現輕微病徵的市民抽血檢查，全部結果為陰性。過去三天未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。鑑於近日僅有零星市民前往青衣長亨社區會堂和葵芳邨近葵明樓的醫護站，加上全部於上述醫護站接受抽血檢查的人士結果均為陰性，相關醫護站將由明日起停止運作，而早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）則會繼續每日由上午九時至下午六時運作。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-10 18:50,2025-11-10 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/10/P2025111000691.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 10), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 59 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, three were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the recent outbreak of CF has shown a sustained downward trend. There were 107 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (November 2 to 8), showing a significant decrease compared to the previous week (October 26 to November 1), which reported 259 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Shenzhen (30 cases), Jiangmen (23 cases), Foshan (21 cases) and Zhuhai (10 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  In light of the recent recording of a locally acquired case in Kwai Tsing District, the CHP conducted a risk assessment and collaborated with relevant District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention to over 10 000 households in Mount Haven and the surrounding areas, Kwai Chung Plaza, Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan and the vicinity to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  From November 3 to 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 14 000 individuals residing or working in higher-risk districts through health consultation booths, along with its enquiry hotline, door-to-door visits and questionnaire surveys conducted in the districts concerned. The CHP has arranged blood tests for a total of 14 persons who had mild symptoms, and all tested negative. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past three days. Since the health consultation booths at Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi and Kwai Fong Estate (near Kwai Ming House) have only sporadic visits recently and all individuals who underwent blood tests have returned negative results, these two booths will cease operations starting tomorrow. The previously established enquiry hotline (2125 2373) will continue to operate daily from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


   The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

   Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-11-10 18:45,2025-11-10 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/10/P2025111000686.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（十一月十日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十一月二日至八日期間，衞生防護中心錄得兩宗輸入及一宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，其中兩宗輸入個案有流行病學關連。三名病人均有長期病患。

首兩宗個案分別涉及一名74歲男病人及一名63歲女病人，他們為同住家人，於潛伏期內十月二十六日至三十日參加一個旅行團前往天津及北京。調查顯示這兩宗個案有流行病學關連，屬輸入個案。中心正主動聯絡參加同一旅行團的人士，提供評估及醫學監察。中心亦已把個案通報中國內地衞生當局。

另一宗個案涉及一名58歲男病人，居於沙田區，屬社區感染個案。

衞生防護中心流行病學調查仍在繼續，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。

截至十一月八日，今年錄得140宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

各位傳媒朋友大家好。

根據《基本法》附件一和附件二，候選人資格審查委員會（資審會）負責審查並確認選舉委員會委員候選人、行政長官候選人和立法會議員候選人的資格。資審會就有關人士是否符合「擁護《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區基本法》」和「效忠中華人民共和國香港特別行政區」的法定要求和條件作出決定。

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉提名期由十月二十四日開始，直至上星期四，即十一月六日結束。10個地方選區、28個功能界別和選舉委員會界別的選舉主任在提名期內共收到161份提名表格。

其實自提名期由十月二十四日開始，在整個提名期內，候選人資格審查的工作都在一直同步進行，而資審會亦已在今日開會，完成對所有參選人的資格審查核實工作，確認全部161名參選人均符合「擁護《基本法》」和「效忠香港特區」的法定要求和條件，並裁定他們的提名為有效。

作為資審會主席，我感謝資審會各委員及秘書處過去一段時間的努力，以及各選舉主任辦公室、選舉事務處和相關部門的充分配合，令審查工作得以順利完成，並且盡早公布獲有效提名的候選人名單，這個做法是希望各候選人可以盡早展開選舉工程。

十二月七日舉行的立法會換屆選舉對「一國兩制」行穩致遠、特區良政善治，以及市民福祉都極為重要。正如行政長官所說，立法會選舉是香港邁向「由治及興」進程中的一件大事；是香港加快發展經濟、改善民生的大事；是關乎你我、關乎每一位香港市民的大事。

我留意到近期社會各界都主動積極響應行政長官和選舉管理委員會主席的呼籲，共同推動社會各界眾志成城投入選舉，鼓勵所有選民在投票日行使公民權利和履行公民責任，而不同機構、企業、組織和團體亦響應負起社會責任，鼓勵屬下員工積極投票，並為員工投票提供便利措施。我在此多謝他們。

現時距離十二月七日投票日有大約一個月的時間。我期望各候選人把握機會，展現抱負，同時展示香港的優質競選文化，以專業、公平的態度比政綱、比理念、比承擔、比貢獻，展現良性競爭以及正面、優質的選舉文化，體現香港的高質量民主。

我亦衷心希望廣大市民認真了解各候選人的理念和政綱，並在十二月七日投票日積極行使手中神聖的選票，為香港、為自己選出愛國愛港、立場堅定、有能力、有抱負、有擔當的新一屆立法會議員，為香港的長期繁榮發展，為市民的幸福福祉，為國家的富強和建設、民族復興作出貢獻。

特區政府將繼續與選舉管理委員會緊密合作，全力辦好十二月七日的立法會選舉，確保選舉公平、公正、誠實和安全有序地進行。

接下來，我請曾國衞局長跟大家講講有關選舉論壇的安排。多謝大家。"

一名三十三歲入境男旅客於九月十四日從日本東京飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在他的個人行李內檢獲約一萬一千支未完稅香煙及約四萬零二百件另類吸煙產品，市值共約十六萬五千元，應課稅值約三萬六千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日就違反《應課稅品條例》及《進出口條例》被法庭判處監禁四個月及罰款一千五百元。

此外，海關人員於十一月八日在香港國際機場截查一名四十五歲抵港男旅客，並在他的個人行李內檢獲約四萬六千支未完稅香煙，市值約十八萬八千元，應課稅值約十五萬一千元。該名抵港旅客隨即被捕。他今日在法庭就違反《應課稅品條例》，被判處監禁二十四星期和罰款二千元。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Four incoming male passengers convicted and jailed for possessing and dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and for importing alternative smoking products (with photos),2025-11-10 18:15,2025-11-10 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/10/P2025111000599.htm,"Four incoming male passengers were sentenced from 14 weeks to four months' imprisonment and fined from $1,500 to $2,000 respectively by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (November 10) for possession and dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes, failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

A 33-year-old incoming male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Tokyo, Japan, on September 14. During Customs clearance, Customs officers seized about 11 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 40 200 alternative smoking products, with a total estimated market value of about $165,000 and a duty potential of about $36,000, from his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to four months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,500 by the court today for contravening the DCO and IEO.

In addition, Customs officers intercepted a 45-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on November 8. About 46 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $188,000 and a duty potential of about $151,000, were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to 24 weeks' imprisonment and fined $2,000 for contravening the DCO by the court today.

Two incoming male passengers, aged 36 and 45, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday (November 9). About 16 000 and 21 000 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from their personal baggage respectively. The estimated market value was about $67,000 and $88,000, and the duty potential was about $54,000 and $71,000 respectively. The two persons were arrested immediately. As a result, they were sentenced to 14 weeks' imprisonment with a fine of $2,000, and 16 weeks' imprisonment with a fine of $2,000 respectively, for contravening the DCO by the court today.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

徐衛剛部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部部長）、凌浩先生（香港寬頻主席兼執行董事）、李昕先生（香港寬頻執行董事兼行政總裁）、葉成輝博士（香港寬頻集團總裁及營運總裁）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。今日我很高興與大家一起見證香港寬頻成立25周年這個重要的里程碑。

香港作為區域電訊樞紐，憑藉世界級的光纖網絡基建、對外電訊設施，以及卓越的通訊技術和客戶服務，一直在全球電訊市場中穩佔領先地位。現時香港的5G用戶約900萬，本港的住戶滲透率長期保持在97%以上，其中超過八成的住戶已接駁光纖網絡。香港在電訊市場上所取得的成就，實有賴各個電訊商的努力不懈及精益求精的服務精神。

香港寬頻在香港扎根四分之一世紀，在過去25年來，一直致力發展本地固網市場，為市民及企業提供高質、高效的電訊服務，並不斷透過創新的服務推動各行各業高增值發展。電訊服務現已成為廣大市民日常生活及企業運作中不可或缺的部分，而光纖網絡及技術更是未來發展智慧城市的重要基石，我期待香港寬頻能夠繼續秉承「沒有最好，只有更好」的精神服務社會，助力香港企業創出新高度。

電訊服務的創新與香港新經濟增長點息息相關。行政長官在早前發表的《施政報告》提到，特區政府將制訂《發展低空經濟規劃行動綱領》，透過制度創新與技術突破，推動香港成為低空創新應用的核心樞紐。在通訊方面，通訊事務管理局剛於十月底推出低空經濟活動專用頻譜，進一步支援無人機安全高效運行，支持低空經濟生態圈的建設。我留意到香港寬頻亦積極推動低空經濟的發展，並在上月與內地的研究所簽署戰略合作框架協議，共同探索低空經濟、智慧城市及物聯網等領域的商業化應用，響應國家「空天地海一體化」發展戰略。

此外，香港寬頻一直致力於科技創新，例如去年啓動的「香港寬頻創科生態聯盟」，匯聚了創科人才、行業領袖及技術資源，不但有助香港及內地企業應對數碼化挑戰，並幫助本地企業進軍粵港澳大灣區及「一帶一路」沿線市場。這些舉措與政府推動電訊領域持續高增值發展的目標不謀而合，為香港電訊業的未來發展持續注入新動力。

我衷心感謝香港寬頻過去25年來積極配合特區政府的政策，致力推動科技創新及保障通訊網絡安全穩健發展。我相信香港寬頻的領導層將帶領香港寬頻繼往開來，展開嶄新篇章，與香港社會「連繫你我．風雨同路」，為未來通訊業發展作出更大貢獻。

最後，我亦呼籲大家緊記在十二月七日立法會選舉的大日子，積極履行公民責任，投下你手中重要的一票。大家亦可鼓勵你的家人和朋友踴躍投票，選出為香港繁榮穩定發展貢獻的立法會議員。十二月七日，投入選舉，共創未來！多謝各位。"

They also promoted the LegCo Election to the market vendors at the Municipal Services Building.

Mrs Yeung, the Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Clement Leung, and the deputy secretaries formed a team to visit colleagues at the Hong Kong and Islands Prosecution and Licensing Section and the Wan Chai District Environmental Hygiene Office of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, as well as the Wan Chai District Leisure Services Office, the Lockhart Road Sports Centre and the Lockhart Road Public Library of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.

These civil servants interact most frequently with the public and serve as frontline service providers. I hope that each civil servant in every department at all levels clearly receives the message of voting together and demonstrates team spirit. Civil servants have a duty to lead by example, support the LegCo Election, and vote for their preferred representatives.""

Mrs Yeung also took the opportunity to explain to civil servants working on shifts that they will not be prevented from voting due to their shift schedule, as departments will co-ordinate voting schedules with colleagues. She said, ""Departments will also provide appropriate arrangements to allow colleagues to have a brief leave from their posts to vote at their designated polling stations. If colleagues are not on duty that day, I also encourage them to seize the opportunity and bring along family members to vote early.""

尊敬的龔楊恩慈副主席（公益慈善研究院副主席兼香港賽馬會慈善信託基金信託人）、王躍工副院長（故宮博物院副院長）、李焯芬教授（團結香港基金轄下中國文化研究院理事會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好。我很高興今日應香港賽馬會慈善信託基金邀請來到大館，出席「Hello！故宮」大篷車進校園的啓動儀式。我感謝故宮博物院和中國文化研究院的悉心籌備、香港賽馬會和公益慈善研究院的鼎力支持，推出「Hello！故宮」大篷車進校園計劃，推動中華文化與教育普及化。

弘揚中華文化是發展香港文化政策的重要方向，政府設立弘揚中華文化辦公室（弘揚辦），專責統籌康文署（康樂及文化事務署）內與中華文化和歷史相關的活動、交流和合作，包括每年舉辦中國通史系列展覽，以及「中華文化節」，全面推廣豐富多元的中華文化。弘揚辦也與教育局緊密合作，定期推出中國歷史文化系列教師培訓班，內容涵蓋歷史文化、藝術、科技、非物質文化遺產等範圍，以協助教師推廣中華文化。

除了學校教育以外，弘揚辦更推出一系列的社區活動，例如「中華文化•公園遊蹤」系列，透過遊覽和考察本港富中華文化特色的公園，帶領公眾認識不同朝代的歷史和建築文化。截至九月底，康文署今年已經推出超過50項推廣中華文化和歷史的活動，吸引超過70萬人次參加。

此外，康文署轄下非物質文化遺產辦事處也不時舉辦不同的互動展覽和教育活動，將非遺文化帶進校園和社區，包括今年六月再次推動走訪香港各區學校及公眾地方，全新設計的非遺專車「移動非遺」。

「Hello！故宮」大篷車進校園計劃理念與我們推廣中華文化的政策方向一致，我們透過沉浸式的數字化體驗，讓同學們了解故宮的建築、文化和宮廷生活，從小培養他們對於中華優秀傳統文化的認識和欣賞能力，提高他們的國民身分認同。此外，計劃透過藝術與科技的融合，活靈活現地呈獻北京故宮博物院珍貴的文物，並用體驗車或體驗箱的方式進入不同的學校，以生動有趣多變的形式走近青少年，是一個將中華優秀傳統文化進行創造性轉化、創新性發展的好例子。

我相信「Hello！故宮」大篷車進校園計劃將激發我們年輕一代學習中華文化的興趣，並啓發他們親身看看故宮珍藏瑰寶。我鼓勵大家也可以參觀在西九文化區的香港故宮文化博物館，不同專題和特別展覽展示故宮文物，加深公眾理解輝煌燦爛的中華文明。培育藝術人才也是香港故宮文化博物館的一個重要使命，透過舉辦不同類型和主題的學習項目，例如藝術表演、電影放映會、工作坊，讓青年以不同體驗方式學習歷史文化意涵，親身體驗傳統文化之美。

中華文化擁有超過五千年的歷史，絢爛繽紛、博大精深，是世界文明的瑰寶，我希望故宮大篷車走遍全港的學校，啓發更多年輕人對中華文化好奇心，培養年輕文化傳承者，並深化他們的愛國情懷。

推動中華文化傳承發展需要社會各界一起投入，建設一個美好社區，同樣需要各方共同努力。香港立法會換屆選舉將於今年十二月七日舉行，我鼓勵大家行使公民權利，在選舉當日踴躍投票，一起「投入選舉，共創未來」。

最後，我衷心再次感謝主辦單位故宮博物院和中國文化研究院的精心策劃，以及香港賽馬會、公益慈善研究院、大館和社會各界對本次計劃的大力支持。我祝願計劃圓滿成功，謝謝大家。"

Subsequently, a 37-year-old male consignee suspected to be connected with the case was arrested.

Customs officers yesterday (November 9) conducted a follow-up investigation in Sham Shui Po, further arresting a 59-year-old woman who was suspected to be connected with the case.

The arrested man and woman have been released on bail pending investigation.

Customs reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items in and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

盧金榮博士（香港中華廠商聯合會會長）、陳家偉先生（香港品牌發展局主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。今日很榮幸出席由香港品牌發展局舉辦的《香港．新質品牌力》電子書首發儀式。首先，我祝賀香港品牌發展局成立二十周年，感謝他們多年來為推動本地品牌發展作出卓越貢獻。

二十年來，香港品牌發展局致力提升品牌競爭力，對推動本地企業品牌建設不遺餘力。近年全球市場環境不斷變化，香港品牌亦面對前所未有的挑戰與機遇。《香港．新質品牌力》電子書的出版，正好與大家總結過去、迎接未來——透過深入剖析本地企業如何在創新、數碼化轉型及國際市場中求新求變，為大家提供寶貴的經驗分享。

政府一直支持本地企業發展品牌，通過多項資助計劃和措施，加強各地消費者對香港品牌的認識。當中，「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）扮演關鍵角色。今年《施政報告》公布，政府將向「BUD專項基金」注資14.3億元，進一步擴大資助地域範圍，涵蓋包括「一帶一路」國家在內的八個新增經濟體，為更多中小企提供資助及支援，幫助他們拓展品牌及市場。

隨着全球電子商務的快速發展和消費習慣的轉變，電商平台已成為企業提升品牌影響力的重要渠道。因此，政府積極推動本地企業的數碼轉型，協助他們將品牌走向更廣闊的舞台。當中「創意．電商無限」計劃旨在透過資助和專業支援，幫助企業建立及優化電商平台，加強數碼營銷能力，讓香港品牌在數碼經濟浪潮中把握機遇，實現持續增長。

在國家的支持下，我們正積極融入粵港澳大灣區發展。大灣區是香港品牌的試驗場，我們鼓勵本地企業利用區內蓬勃的消費市場及人才資源，建立跨界合作，以提升香港品牌知名度。未來三年，我們將繼續在內地和東南亞國家聯盟電商市場舉辦「香港好物節」，為香港企業提供良好的展示及推廣平台，擴大品牌影響力和市場覆蓋。

正如古語所言：「書中自有黃金屋」，《香港．新質品牌力》電子書的發布，正是匯聚本地企業心血與創新成果的結晶，深信它必定為行業發展帶來積極影響。展望未來，我們將繼續與業界攜手，深化品牌建設及推動多元化發展，並透過政策、資源配套及人才培育，助力香港品牌穩步前行，開創更輝煌的篇章。

最後，我在此呼籲，立法會選舉將於十二月七日舉行，請大家投下你手中寶貴的一票，並鼓勵親友及同事踴躍投票，履行公民責任之餘，亦為香港的未來出一分力。十二月七日，讓我們投入選舉，共創未來！謝謝大家。"

å°æ¬çé­å©·å©·å¯é¨é· (Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance, Ms Guo Tingting), çæ¾èç§æ¸é· (Secretary-General of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Wang Songmiao), David (Chairman of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council (AFRC), Dr David Sun), Janey (Chief Executive Officer of the AFRC, Ms Janey Lai), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am delighted to join the AFRC Regional Regulatory Forum. This second edition has brought together some 400 participants - regulators, industry leaders and academics - from across nine economies. To those who have travelled from abroad, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong. We treasure your participation, and look forward to meaningful exchanges of perspectives and regulatory collaboration.

  The theme of the forum today, ""Accounting for the Future"", carries a clever dual meaning: What lies ahead for the accounting profession? And how must the profession evolve to truly account for the future?

  We are living through a time of profound transformation in which the accounting profession is being reshaped. Technological advancement, especially artificial intelligence (AI), transforms the work and value of accountants. Meanwhile, the growing global focus on sustainability is expanding the remit of audit and assurance. How can we embrace AI and ensure the integrity of AI-assisted processes? And how can we ensure the relevance and credibility of sustainability reporting?

Hong Kong's path

  As an international financial and business centre, Hong Kong must be at the forefront of these developments. And a world-class financial hub must be built on the highest standards of professional integrity too. These are vital for capital to flow with confidence, for markets to function effectively, and for economic activity to flourish.

  For Hong Kong, there is an additional dimension amid today's evolving geoeconomic landscape. That is our role to connect China with the world and to serve as a two-way platform for capital and businesses. The recent Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee laid out China's development roadmap under the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan, reaffirming the country's commitment to high-level, two-way opening up. In essence, China is welcoming more investments and foreign businesses into the country, and at the same time, encouraging Mainland enterprises to go global to reconfigure their supply chain and industry chain, as well as deepen international industrial collaboration.

  Many of these Mainland enterprises are choosing to ""go global"" through Hong Kong. They are leveraging our full suite of financial and professional services, from trade finance, supply chain and treasury management, to cross-border tax advisory and ESG (environmental, social and governance) consulting. This growing momentum is reflected in our capital markets. Hong Kong currently leads the world in IPO (initial public offering) fund raising, and there are over 300 companies in the pipeline waiting to be listed on our Stock Exchange.

  In this context, Hong Kong is not just a ""super connector"" but also a ""super value-adder"". We play a vital bridging role, helping Mainland enterprises connect with international markets and converge Mainland standards with the global ones. Our professional services sector will help them navigate increasingly complex regulatory environments, and communicate with global investors and other stakeholders, for example in the areas of financial reporting, corporate governance and sustainability.

  Ladies and gentlemen, all these developments are placing higher expectations on our accounting and auditing professionals – demanding an unwavering commitment to the highest standards, uncompromising professional integrity, a heightened sense of social responsibility, and greater versatility in skills and expertise.

  I'm pleased to note that our industry and regulator are working together to advance the development of the profession. In Hong Kong, regulators are enablers of progress and innovation. As David eloquently illustrated with the ""chopsticks principle"", the AFRC has a dual mandate of prudent regulation and market development facilitation.

  Allow me to supplement two points. First, the philosophy of promoting regulation and development side by side is a core and unique strength of our regulation. Regulators are required to maintain close engagement with stakeholders, and address their challenges and pain points while staying alert to emerging growth opportunities.

  Second, about policy co-ordination. As you know, we do not adopt a single super-regulator approach. Each sector has its own regulator, for example, the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) for the banks and the SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) for the securities brokers. But we have established a co-ordination mechanism that regularly brings regulators together to share market insights and intelligence, and to address cross-sectoral issues or emerging issues that may not readily fall onto the shoulder of a particular regulator. This mechanism ensures that our regulatory frameworks remain agile, forward-looking and responsive to market situations, and facilitate market innovation.

  On the global stage, when it comes to regulation, Hong Kong has always been at the forefront of international best practices. But we do more than just that - we also contribute. We take part in various international committees and contribute our perspectives and experiences in standard setting, education and capacity building. For example, in the area of sustainability reporting, the CEO of the SFC co-chairs the IOSCO (International Organization of Securities Commissions) Sustainable Finance Task Force’s Workstream on Corporate Reporting, which plays a pivotal role in the development and implementation of the ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board)disclosure standards.

Embracing the future: sustainability, AI and talent

  Looking ahead, the accounting profession in the region must rise to the challenges of today and tomorrow, and capture the opportunities arising. Three issues stand out: sustainability, technology and talent.

  First, sustainability. While the US (United States) is rolling back its climate commitments, many others - including China - are moving full steam ahead. In Hong Kong, we remain firmly committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, by a multipronged strategy: net-zero electricity generation, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction.

  And our accounting profession is making significant strides in advancing sustainability reporting. With the ISSB now setting a global baseline for corporate disclosure, Hong Kong is moving decisively in the same direction. In December last year, we launched Hong Kong's Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure, setting a clear path for large publicly accountable entities to fully adopt the ISSB standards by 2028. In June, the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) recognised us as one of the first jurisdictions with a clear and credible roadmap.

  The AFRC's upcoming public consultation on a local sustainability assurance framework marks another important step forward.

  Second, technology, particularly AI. The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government embraces AI and is driving its advancement through a twin-engine strategy: developing AI as a core industry, and promoting ""AI+"", i.e. AI as an enabler to upgrade and transform traditional sectors.

  The transformative power of AI is formidable. It brings tremendous potential, but at the same time, its use must be matched with a strong sense of responsibility. That's why we are building strong governance frameworks for the responsible adoption of AI.

  In financial services, we have issued a policy statement on the ethical use of AI. For the accounting profession in particular, the AFRC will assess the emerging opportunities and potential risks associated with the use of AI by audit firms. Guidance will be developed to enhance awareness and support AI deployment.

  Finally, talent. While the accounting profession is evolving rapidly, one truth remains unchanged - and has become even more vital: its future success depends on people.

  Like many jurisdictions around the world, Hong Kong faces a persistent shortage of accounting talent. To address this, the AFRC and HKICPA (Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants) are working closely with academic and professional institutions on a number of education and professional development initiatives. And as a stop-gap measure, we welcome talent from outside Hong Kong to join us. In March this year, we included accounting professionals in our Talent List to make it easier for qualified non-local accountants to come to work in Hong Kong.

  Over the longer term, we will continue to invest in building a vibrant future for the accounting profession, providing practitioners with continuous upskilling to further enhance their strategic and advisory capabilities. This will help them better seize the opportunities on the horizon.

  Fellow accountants and friends, just as crucial is work-life balance. Let's also work to cultivate a culture that supports sustainable, fulfilling career paths, making the profession more attractive and rewarding for the next generation.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, in answering the questions for ""Accounting for the Future"", perhaps I can borrow a quote from Mahatma Gandhi: ""The future depends on what you do today.""

  Hong Kong stands ready to work with you all today - to shape that future together.

  I wish you a successful and inspiring Forum, and continued good health and business in the time ahead. Thank you."
