Housing Department responds to Ombudsman's direct investigation report,2025-08-07 12:00,2025-08-07 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700219.htm,"  Regarding a report released by the Office of the Ombudsman today (August 7) on its direct investigation into ""Housing Department's Management of Public Housing Estates: Air-conditioner Dripping"", the Housing Department (HD) expressed appreciation to the Ombudsman for recognising the pro-active attitude and initiative of the Housing Authority/HD in implementing enhancement measures in managing water dripping from air-conditioners in public housing estates to continuously improve the effectiveness of estate management.

  The HD has implemented multiple measures to address the issue of water dripping from air-conditioners in public housing estates. These include the launching of the Installation Programme of Condensation Drain-pipe for Air-conditioners in 2006 to put in place condensation drain pipes in public rental housing (PRH) flats to facilitate the discharge of condensation water from air-conditioners. Since 2008, water dripping from air-conditioners has been included in the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement in Public Housing Estates (Marking Scheme), with follow-up actions handled through daily patrols and inspections by special operation teams. In addition, the HD adopts information technology, including the trial use of the ""Mobile Application System for Daily Patrol"" which enables frontline security personnel and building supervisors to report cases of water dripping from air-conditioners in real time for swift follow-up actions. The HD is also actively exploring the use of professional technological equipment to assist in identifying the source of water dripping.

  The number of complaints regarding water dripping from air-conditioners received by the HD has significantly decreased by 93 per cent, from approximately 18 900 cases in 2005 to an average of about 1 300 cases per year from 2022 to 2024, accounting for 0.16 per cent of about 800 000 PRH households and clearly reflecting that the effectiveness of the multiple measures implemented by the HD in the handling of cases for water dripping from air-conditioners.

  The HD has further implemented enhanced measures in December 2024 by giving five days for concerned households to rectify any water dripping problem from their air-conditioners, failing which, action would be taken immediately under the Marking Scheme. Meanwhile, enforcement efficiency has been improved by allowing security supervisors in all public housing estates to issue ""Notification Slips"" to offending households on the spot. The HD will continue to strengthen staff training and supervision of outsourced property management companies.

  Furthermore, the HD will continue to strengthen publicity and education for PRH households through various channels, reminding residents to regularly maintain and repair air-conditioners. Since households sometimes may not be aware of water dripping from their air-conditioners, the HD encourages affected individuals to provide information and work together to identify the source of water dripping.

  ""We would like to thank the Ombudsman for the affirmation and recognition of our efforts, and appreciate its valuable views on the current mechanisms and measures. We accept the relevant recommendations and will continue to streamline our workflow, thereby ensuring such cases can be detected and addressed promptly,"" an HD spokesman said."
​房屋署回應申訴專員公署主動調查報告,2025-08-07 12:00,2025-08-07 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700216.htm,"就申訴專員公署今日（八月七日）發表「房屋署對公共屋邨的管理：冷氣機滴水」的主動調查報告，房屋署感謝公署肯定香港房屋委員會／房屋署在執管公共屋邨的冷氣機滴水問題的積極性，並主動採取優化措施，持續提升公共屋邨管理效能。

房屋署已實施多項措施針對公共屋邨冷氣機滴水事宜，包括早於二○○六年推行冷氣機去水管安裝計劃，為公屋單位裝置冷氣機去水管，方便租戶將冷氣機冷凝水排走；自二○○八年起將冷氣機滴水納入屋邨管理扣分制（扣分制）的規管，並透過日常巡查及特遣隊巡查跟進租戶冷氣機滴水的情況。此外，房屋署運用資訊科技，包括於屋邨推出「巡邏易」試驗計劃，讓前線護衞職員及樓宇監督透過專用手機程式實時報告冷氣機滴水的情況，以便迅速跟進；亦積極探討使用專業科技器材，協助查找滴水源頭。

房屋署接獲冷氣機滴水的投訴宗數已大幅下降百分之九十三，由二○○五年約18 900宗下降至二○二二至二○二四年每年平均約1 300宗，佔約80萬公屋租戶的0.16%，反映房屋署已實施的多項措施有效處理冷氣機滴水個案。

房屋署在二○二四年十二月起更進一步實施優化措施，給予租戶五天限期處理冷氣機出現滴水情況，否則會即時採取扣分制措施；並同時提升執管效能，所有公共屋邨的保安監督人員可即場向違規租戶發出「違例事項通知書」。房屋署會繼續加強職員培訓，以及對外判物業管理公司的監管。

此外，房屋署會繼續透過不同渠道加強公屋住戶的宣傳教育，提醒租戶定期保養和維修冷氣機。由於租戶有時候並不容易察覺自己單位的冷氣機滴水，房屋署鼓勵受影響的人士提供資料，攜手合作找出滴水源頭。

房屋署發言人說：「我們感謝公署對我們工作的肯定和認同，亦感謝公署對現行機制和措施提供寶貴意見。我們接納有關建議，並會繼續優化工作流程，從而及早發現並處理這些個案。」"
Office of The Ombudsman announces results of direct investigation operation into Housing Department's handling of air-conditioner dripping in public housing estates (with photo),2025-08-07 11:00,2025-08-07 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080600680.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (August 7) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the Housing Department (HD)'s handling of air-conditioner dripping in public housing estates, with 15 major recommendations for improvement made to the HD.

Over 780 000 households, comprising about 2 million residents, live in 195 public housing estates under the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA). The HD and its property services agents (PSAs) are responsible for the daily management of these estates, which encompasses a wide array of duties. Proper management of public housing is a crucial livelihood issue. Following the Office of The Ombudsman's direct investigation operation into illegal parking in public housing estates completed in March this year, this direct investigation operation deals with air-conditioner dripping.

Mr Chan said, ""Over the years, the HD has made extensive efforts to successfully alleviate the problem of air-conditioner dripping through the implementation of the air-conditioner drain-pipe installation programme, and inclusion of such misdeeds under the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement. The number of complaints received by the HD dropped by 93 per cent from around 18 900 in 2005 to an average of around 1 300 from 2022 to 2024. This remarkable accomplishment merits recognition and appreciation.""

However, air-conditioner dripping remains a typical problem every summer. The HD must step up its efforts to ensure a hygienic and quality living environment for residents. Among the public housing estates under HKHA, the property management of around two-thirds are outsourced to the HD's PSAs (known as outsourced estates), and the remaining one-third are directly managed by the HD (known as directly managed estates).

Between 2022 and 2024, outsourced and directly managed estates received 2 826 and 1 049 complaints respectively about air-conditioner dripping. During those years, related complaints rose by 45.5 per cent in outsourced estates and 20.1 per cent in directly managed estates. In 2024, 10.6 per cent of the complaints in outsourced estates were repeated complaints, compared to 6.3 per cent in directly managed estates. These figures reflect that directly managed estates outperformed outsourced estates, where outsourced estates had a higher increase in the number of complaints and a higher percentage of repeated complaints. In terms of the proportion of complaints over the number of households, outsourced estates recorded percentages of 0.17 per cent, 0.20 per cent and 0.24 per cent in 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively while directly managed estates recorded percentages of 0.12 per cent, 0.12 per cent and 0.14 per cent during the same period.
There are two categories of misdeeds under the Marking Scheme: those incurring a warning prior to the allotment of penalty points, and those resulting in an immediate point allotment. Air-conditioner dripping falls into the former category. The Office's investigation revealed that in air-conditioner dripping cases, the HD's PSAs often issued reminder letters to non-compliant tenants before enforcing the Marketing Scheme. These letters were merely advisory in nature. During the Office's inquiry and investigation, initially the HD had not yet formulated guidelines on issuing reminder letters. Between 2022 and 2024, the HD's PSAs issued an average of two reminder letters per complaint, which was more than tenfold of those issued in directly managed estates. There were cases which revealed that despite the repeated issuance of reminder letters, the dripping problem still occurred. As the HD's PSAs might not be required to report the number of reminder letters issued to the HD, the HD can hardly verify whether its PSAs are issuing too many reminder letters or mishandling air-conditioner dripping complaints.

The Office's investigation also found that the HD's operational guidelines for handling air-conditioner dripping cases are too brief, focusing only on the procedures for enforcing the Marking Scheme without clear instructions for frontline staff on such aspects as complaint investigations, source detections, air-conditioner testing and its duration, dealing with unco-operative tenants and arranging follow-up inspections. The Office considers the absence of proper guidelines might have resulted in inconsistent handling by frontline staff, as evidenced in some cases.

The Office is pleased to note that during its inquiry and investigation, the HD has, since December 2024, implemented enhanced measures under the Marking Scheme, such as launching standardised ""advisory letters"", granting a uniform grace period of five days and formulating guidelines for issuing advisory letters and follow-up actions etc.

Mr Chan said, ""Nothing about people's livelihoods is trivial. Air-conditioner dripping probably causes not only hygiene-related nuisances but also noise disturbances. From an estate management perspective, it is incumbent on the HD to thoroughly enforce the Marking Scheme in order to address the dripping problems and resolve such complaints promptly. The Office considers it undesirable for the HD to be unable to ascertain in the past whether its PSAs were issuing too many reminder letters and handling cases inconsistently. The Office recommends that the HD explore ways to formulate measures for monitoring the issuance of advisory letters and case reporting to strengthen its supervision of its PSAs, as well as to record the details and follow-up actions in relation to air-conditioner dripping complaints more systematically. The HD should also beef up its operational guidelines and expedite the adoption of innovative technologies to improve its ability to trace the sources of dripping. Furthermore, the Office recommends that the HD consider collaboration with other government departments (such as the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)) to foster exchanges of experiences across their respective areas of responsibility.""

Overall, the Office has made 15 major recommendations for improvements. It is pleased to note that all the recommendations have been agreed by the HD.
The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the HD include:

• explore the formulation of measures for monitoring the issuance of advisory letters and case reporting to strengthen its supervision of its PSAs;

• explore how to record the details and follow-up of dripping complaints more systematically to facilitate monitoring;

• consider enhancing its operational guidelines for handling air-conditioner dripping cases, enabling estate management staff to work in clarity and effectively;

• beef up the operational guidelines with clear procedures for frontline staff to investigate the source of dripping, including making every effort to enter suspected flats for air-conditioner testing where there is no other way to verify the source of dripping, for example, when the source cannot be determined through external observation, standardising the durations for testing, and specifying follow-up actions when the source remains unidentified;

• draw up operational guidelines and notices in designated format for cases where the source of dripping has not been determined;

• consider requiring its PSAs to include in their monthly reports the number of advisory letters issued and any repeated cases to facilitate problem detection and follow-up;

• expedite and broaden the adoption of innovative technologies to strengthen its ability to detect dripping air-conditioners; and

• consider collaborating with other government departments (such as the FEHD) to explore opportunities of conducting large-scale inspections as well as publicity and education campaigns, with a view to increasing public engagement and boosting awareness of proper air-conditioner maintenance.

​申訴專員公署公布就房屋署處理公共屋邨冷氣機滴水的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2025-08-07 11:00,2025-08-07 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080600678.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（八月七日）宣布公署完成房屋署處理公共屋邨冷氣機滴水的主動調查行動，並向房屋署提出共15項主要改善建議。

超過78萬住戶、約200萬居民居住於香港房屋委員會（房委會）轄下的195條公共屋邨。屋邨的日常管理由房屋署或其聘任的外判服務承辦商負責，管理範疇眾多，公屋管理是否妥善，屬重要民生事宜。繼公署今年三月完成有關公共屋邨違例泊車的主動調查行動後，是項主動調查行動處理的是冷氣機滴水。

陳積志表示：「房屋署多年來做了大量相關工作，透過推行冷氣機去水管安裝計劃以及將冷氣機滴水不當行為納入屋邨管理扣分制，成功將冷氣機滴水的問題大幅改善。房屋署收到的投訴，由二○○五年的約18 900宗下降至近三年（即二○二二至二○二四年）每年平均約1 300宗，下降幅度高達93%，工作成果值得肯定和讚賞。」

然而，冷氣機滴水滋擾始終是每年夏天的常見問題，房屋署有責任更妥善處理，為居民締造衞生和優質的居住環境。現時房委會轄下的公共屋邨之中，約三分之二的物業管理工作由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商承辦（外判邨），其餘三分之一則由房屋署直接管理（直管邨）。

外判邨與直管邨於二○二二至二○二四年期間，分別接獲2 826宗和1 049宗冷氣機滴水投訴。外判邨的冷氣機滴水投訴個案數字從二○二二年至二○二四年上升45.5%，而直管邨的冷氣機滴水投訴個案數字則上升20.1%。於二○二四年，外判邨的重複投訴佔10.6%，而直管邨則為6.3%。這些數字均顯示直管邨情況較佳，而外判邨的投訴升幅或重複投訴百分比，均表現稍遜。若以投訴所佔戶數計算，外判邨的冷氣機滴水投訴個案數字，於二○二二年、二○二三年及二○二四年0.17%、0.20%和0.24%﹔而直管邨於該三年接獲投訴的宗數則佔0.12%、0.12%和0.14%。

扣分制下的不當行為可分為先警告後扣分及即時扣分兩類，冷氣機滴水屬先警告後扣分的違規事項。公署發現，就冷氣機滴水個案，房屋署的外判服務承辦商在執行扣分制之前，不時會向違規租戶發出僅屬勸諭性質的提示信，而公署查訊及調查初期，房屋署沒有為發出提示信制訂指引。在二○二二至二○二四年期間，外判邨的外判服務承辦商就每宗投訴平均發出兩封提示信，數目超過直管邨的十倍。有個案顯示，外判服務承辦商多次發出提示信，未能有效令違規租戶糾正冷氣機滴水的問題。而由於由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商未必須向房屋署呈報提示信數目，該署無法確定外判服務承辦商有否濫發提示信或對冷氣機滴水個案處理不當。

公署調查亦發現，房屋署有關處理冷氣機滴水個案的工作指引比較簡略，只列明執行扣分制的程序，但未有詳述前線人員應如何調查投訴、確定滴水源頭、測試冷氣機及所需時間、處理租戶不合作的情況、安排覆查等。公署認為，正如部分個案顯示，在欠缺適切指引下，前線職員或會處理不一。

公署欣悉，在公署查訊及調查期間，房屋署於二○二四年十二月實施扣分制加強措施，例如統一勸諭信、給予一律五天的寬限期，以及就發出勸諭信及跟進行動訂立指引等。

陳積志表示：「民生無小事，冷氣機滴水可能造成環境衞生滋擾，亦有可能產生噪音滋擾。從屋邨管理角度而言，房屋署有責任貫徹執行扣分制，遏止冷氣機滴水問題及如有相關投訴應盡快解決。公署認為，房屋署無法確定其外判服務承辦商有否濫發提示信及處理不一的情況並不理想。公署建議，房屋署應研究制訂有關發出勸諭信和報告個案的監管措施，加強對其外判服務承辦商的監管，以及研究如何更有系統記錄冷氣機滴水投訴個案的詳情及跟進行動。房屋署亦應加強工作指引，並加快引入創新科技，強化查找冷氣機滴水源頭的能力。此外，公署亦建議房屋署考慮與其他政府部門（例如食物環境衞生署（食環署））協作，就不同範疇互相交流經驗。」

整體而言，公署提出共15項主要改善建議。公署欣悉，房屋署同意公署提出的所有改善建議。

公署向房屋署提出的主要改善建議包括：

• 研究制訂有關發出勸諭信和報告個案的監管措施，加強對由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商的監管；

• 研究如何更有系統記錄冷氣機滴水投訴個案的詳情及跟進行動，以便利監管；

• 考慮優化處理冷氣機滴水個案的工作指引，讓屋邨管理人員可更清晰及有效工作﹔

• 於工作指引明確訂明前線人員應如何調查滴水源頭，包括在沒有其他方式核實的情況下，例如當無法從外觀察確定滴水源頭，盡可能進入懷疑滴水的單位測試冷氣機，並訂定冷氣機測試的時間標準，以及找不到滴水源頭的話，其後續跟進的程序；

• 就處理未能鎖定滴水源頭的情況，訂立工作指引和制訂指定格式的通告文件﹔

• 考慮要求由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商在每月報告標示發出勸諭信的數目，以及有否重複個案，以便較易察覺問題及跟進﹔

• 加快及繼續引入創新科技，強化查找冷氣機滴水源頭的能力；及

• 考慮與其他政府部門協作（例如食環署）探討可否配合進行大規模的巡查行動及宣傳教育活動，藉以增加迴響，提升市民妥善維修保養冷氣機的意識。

FEHD collaborates with relevant departments and stakeholders to strengthen post-rain mosquito control and elimination efforts,2025-08-06 21:16,2025-08-06 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600837.htm,"In response to the prolonged rain on recent days, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will continue to collaborate with relevant departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito control and elimination efforts. These include removing stagnant water at construction sites and locations with higher mosquito infestation risks, and eliminating adult mosquitoes. The FEHD also urges members of the public and stakeholders, including property management companies and construction sites, to step up inspections and remove stagnant water in their areas to prevent and control mosquito infestation.

âA spokesman for the FEHD said today (August 6) that, repeated heavy rain may wash away pesticides previously applied in the environment and lead to increased water accumulation. Sites where stagnant water and mosquito breeding were once detected may now have shifted. The FEHD is therefore continuing to work with relevant departments and stakeholders to intensify inspections of high-risk locations prone to water accumulation after heavy rains, including construction sites, works sites and spots that have previously recorded high gravidtrap indices. If stagnant water is found to be a potential mosquito breeding ground, it will be removed immediately. Larvicides such as temephos sand granules will be applied to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and ultra-low volume fogging operations will be carried out in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.
â
âThe FEHD has also collaborated with District Councils, District Offices, and relevant stakeholders to strengthen publicity and education efforts, and to conduct joint clean-up operations targeting mosquito breeding blackspots (such as public areas in ""three-nil"" buildings) in the districts to further curb mosquito breeding.

August is Hong Kong's rainy season, and hot, rainy weather fosters rapid mosquito breeding. The FEHD reminds members of the public and stakeholders to continue mosquito prevention efforts and remove stagnant water to reduce mosquito breeding opportunities. Effective mosquito control requires the collaborative efforts of the public and all sectors.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and promptly take special mosquito prevention and control measures at home and in other environments during heavy rain. These measures include:


Check home environment (outdoor and open areas in particular) for stagnant water, which can easily lead to mosquito problems;
Check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks, to prevent stagnant water;
âCover water containers such as buckets and basins; and
Check and clean areas prone to stagnant water at least weekly to prevent mosquito breeding.


âPerson-in-charge of property management companies and schools should take the following measures to prevent mosquito breeding caused by rain:


Inspect common areas of the property/school for large areas of stagnant water, and arrange for the removal of stagnant water and filling of sunken areas;
Check drain gates and outlets for blockage by dead leaves or rubbish, and keep drains clear;
Check umbrella stands, umbrella tubes, and air-conditioner drip trays to prevent stagnant water;
âProperly dispose of water containers and place rubbish in covered bins;
âAfter heavy rain, manhole keyhole fillers, adhesive tape, or plastic keyhole covers may be washed away by rainwater. These should be refilled with sand or covered with plastic keyhole covers or adhesive tape; and
Inspect green areas including flower pots, flower beds or gardening areas, and remove stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding.


âConstruction site managers should also conduct early assessments and implement effective measures to prevent mosquito infestations. These measures include:


Inspect the construction site during and after heavy rain to ensure there is no stagnant water that could breed mosquitoes. If large areas of stagnant water are present, they should be emptied as soon as possible using tools like a pump;
âCheck water barriers or other items (such as canvas for covering) for stagnant water. Bamboo scaffolding should have its end caps sealed with fine sand or drilled through to prevent water accumulation; and
If stagnant water is difficult to remove, apply larvicides such as temephos sand granules as appropriate.


âMembers of the public may refer to the FEHD's webpage on mosquito prevention and control (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html), and should constantly pay attention to the information regarding chikungunya fever released by the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health. The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems."
CHP investigates three new imported chikungunya fever cases,2025-08-06 20:50,2025-08-06 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600823.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 6) announced that three new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded, all of which were imported cases, as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the recent CF cases. The CHP reminded members of the public to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

The first case involves a 79-year-old female with good past health living in Southern District. Initial investigations revealed that the patient travelled to Foshan in Guangdong Province to visit relatives between July 1 and 31, and did not recall any history of mosquito bites during the stay. She developed fever and joint pain since August 4. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital yesterday (August 5) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. The patient is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for CF virus upon laboratory testing.

Since the patient stayed in Foshan during most of the incubation period, the CHP considered that the patient was infected during travel, and the case was classified as an imported case. She has no travel collaterals nor household contacts. The CHP's epidemiological investigations is ongoing and has reported the case to the health authorities of Guangdong.

The second and third case involve a 55-year-old man with underlying illnesses and his 10-year-old son with good past health. They live in Kwai Tsing District. Initial investigations revealed that both patients travelled to Bangladesh between July 12 and August 3, and arrived Hong Kong on August 3. The boy recalled a history of mosquito bites during the stay while his father did not recall any history of mosquito bites. The 55-year-old man developed fever and joint pain in Bangladesh since July 27. After returning to Hong Kong, he sought medical attention at Tsing Yi Cheung Hong General Out-patient Clinic on August 4 and was referred to Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital. He was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. The boy developed similar symptoms in Bangladesh since August 1. He sought medical attention at the Hong Kong Adventist Hospital - Tsuen Wan on the day returning to Hong Kong and was admitted. He was transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital yesterday for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. Both patients are now in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for CF virus upon laboratory testing.

Since they stayed in Bangladesh during the whole incubation period, the CHP considered that both patients were infected during travel, and the cases were classified as imported cases. The patient's two household contacts, who are also their travel collaterals, are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance. The CHP's epidemiological investigations is ongoing and has reported the cases to the health authority of Bangladesh.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the patient, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspection of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


A total of four CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

Despite severe or fatal cases caused by CF is rare and the symptoms are milder than that of Dengue Fever, and most patients recover on their own, as local mosquitoes have not carried the CF virus, the Government strives to prevent CF from becoming endemic in Hong Kong, and has adopted multi-pronged emergency preparedness, including strengthening public education and publicity, stepping up control measures at boundary control points, enhancing local testing capabilities, arranging mosquito-free environment for treatments, conducting epidemiological investigations and risk assessments for confirmed cases, intensifying mosquito prevention and control measures, etc. The Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP is equipped with sufficient testing capabilities. The CHP has, in collaboration with the Hospital Authority, further enhanced the local testing capabilities to ensure that in the event of an outbreak, suspected cases could be tested as soon as possible with an aim of early detection and diagnosis.

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs. Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxesin covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Install mosquito screens on windows and doors if necessary, or use mosquito screens or nets in indoor areas;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.

Emergency relief fund for farmers and fishermen affected by rainstorm disaster,2025-08-06 20:25,2025-08-06 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600802.htm,"Local farmers and fishermen who suffered serious losses caused by the recent rainstorm disaster can register with the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) from tomorrow (August 7) for assistance from an emergency relief fund. According to the application guideline of the emergency relief fund, the application deadlines for affected farmers and fishermen are August 15 and September 17 respectively.

An AFCD spokesman said today (August 6) that an appropriate amount of the relief funding would be released to affected eligible farmers and fishermen according to established criteria.

""After each typhoon or natural disaster, AFCD staff will contact farmers, fishermen and fish farmers to assess the resultant damage to their farmland areas, fishing vessels, fish rafts and fish ponds. Depending on the extent of the damage, the department may launch an operation to provide some relief to affected persons."" the spokesman said.

The department's preliminary investigation has revealed that about 300 hectares of farmland in the New Territories and some fishing vessels were affected by the rainstorm disaster.

Affected farmers who need to apply for the fund can submit their applications in person at the Agricultural Extension Office of the AFCD at 5/F, Yuen Long Government Offices, 2 Kiu Lok Square, Yuen Long, or submit their applications online (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/agriculture/agr_loan/agr_loan_erf/agr_loan_erf.html).

24 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-08-06 19:45,2025-08-06 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600780.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Swordfish"" for four consecutive days from August 2 to 5, targeting foreign domestic helpers (helper) who breached their conditions of stay. A total of 24 persons, including 18 suspected illegal workers and six suspected employers, were arrested.

  During the operation, ImmD investigators raided 66 target locations including restaurants, retail stores, guest houses, and commercial and residential buildings. The 18 suspected illegal workers comprised four men and 14 women, aged 19 to 54. Among them, three persons were current helpers, six persons were overstaying ex-helpers, three persons were permitted to stay in Hong Kong on visitor status, five persons were found to be holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong, and one person was an imported worker. ImmD investigators found most of the suspected illegal workers at restaurants performing various jobs, including dishwashing, cooking, waiters and waitresses. Meanwhile, six suspected employers, aged 38 to 49, were in charge of the involved companies or restaurants and suspected of employing the suspected illegal workers.

  ""Helpers should only perform domestic duties for the employers specified in the contracts. They should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employers should not require or allow the helpers to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

  The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  Under the laws of Hong Kong, any person who makes false representation to an Immigration officer commits an offence. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, subject to the maximum penalty of a fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years. The spokesman continued that conspiracy to defraud is a serious offence. Under the Crimes Ordinance, offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."
反非法勞工行動拘二十四人（附圖）,2025-08-06 19:45,2025-08-06 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600781.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於八月二日至八月五日一連四日在全港各區展開代號「劍魚」的反非法勞工行動。在該項打擊外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在港違反逗留條件的行動中，入境處共拘捕24名人士，包括18名懷疑非法勞工及六名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的人士。

行動中，入境處人員一共搜查了66個目標地點，包括酒樓、餐廳、零售商店、賓館、商業大廈及住宅單位等。被捕的18名懷疑非法勞工為四男十四女，年齡介乎19至54歲。當中三名為現職外傭、六名為逾期逗留的前外傭、三名為以訪客身份逗留在港人士、五名為持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）人士、以及一名為輸入勞工。大部分被捕的非法勞工當時在酒樓或餐廳從事各種不同工作，如洗碗、烹飪及侍應等。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的六名人士，年齡介乎38至49歲，他們均為涉案公司或餐廳的相關負責人。

入境處發言人說：「外傭只可以為合約上訂明的僱主料理家務。外傭不得受僱於其他人士擔任任何職務，包括兼職家務工作。僱主亦不得要求或容許傭工為其他人士擔任任何工作。」

入境處發言人強調：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

根據現行法例，任何人士向入境事務處職員作出虛假申述，即屬違法。違例者會被檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款港幣十五萬元及入獄十四年。串謀詐騙是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，根據《刑事罪行條例》最高可處監禁十四年。

此外，入境處發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"

All of the second batch of 75 PIC students of the Ethics College, including 60 male PICs from Pak Sha Wan Correctional Institution and 15 female PICs from Lo Wu Correctional Institution, have successfully completed the programme.

Addressing the graduation ceremony, Head of Charities of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Ms Winnie Ying extended her heartfelt congratulations to the graduates. She expressed her appreciation to the PIC students for their relentless efforts and for overcoming limitations during their studies, demonstrating their determination and ability in pursuing a better future through actions. She said that the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust donated funds to the CSD in 2023 to establish the Jockey Club Education Fund for Rehabilitation to support the operation of the Ethics College and assist PICs in continuing their education. This initiative represents community support for PICs, with the hope that through education, PICs who aspire to pursue studies can equip themselves and reintegrate into society.

The Vice President (Research and Institutional Advancement) of the Hong Kong Metropolitan University, Professor Ricky Kwok, teachers from the Li Ka Shing School of Professional and Continuing Education of the Hong Kong Metropolitan University, and volunteer mentors shared their thoughts on stage and encouraged PICs to maintain their passion for learning and a positive attitude, so that they can contribute to society with the knowledge and skills they have acquired.

Moreover, a band composed of PICs delivered a music performance at the ceremony to express their gratitude to their families and correctional officers for their support in the course of PICs' rehabilitation.

衞生防護中心調查三宗新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案,2025-08-06 19:07,2025-08-06 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600756.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月六日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，錄得三宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案，全部為輸入個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。中心提醒市民，不論在本地或外遊，應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

首宗個案涉及一名過往健康良好的79歲女子，居於南區。初步調查顯示，病人曾於七月一日至三十一日到廣東省佛山市探親，但未能記起曾否被蚊叮。她於八月四日開始出現發燒和關節痛，昨日（八月五日）到瑪麗醫院急症室求診，同日入院並在無蚊環境下接受治療，現時情況穩定。她的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於病人潛伏期大部分時間在佛山市逗留，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人沒有其他同行人士或家居接觸者。中心正繼續流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

第二宗及第三宗個案涉及一名有長期病患的55歲男子及其過往健康良好的10歲兒子，他們居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，兩名病人於七月十二日至八月三日到孟加拉國旅遊，八月三日返抵香港。男童報稱旅遊期間曾被蚊叮咬，而其父親未能記起曾否被蚊叮。該名55歲男子於七月二十七日在孟加拉國出現發燒和關節痛，返港後於八月四日到青衣長康普通科門診診所求診，獲轉介到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，同日入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。而男童於八月一日在孟加拉國出現類似病徵，返港後於同日到香港港安醫院—荃灣求診及入院治療，昨日被轉送瑪嘉烈醫院在無蚊環境下接受治療。兩人現時情況穩定。他們的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於他們整個潛伏期在孟加拉國逗留，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人的另外兩名家居接觸者亦為同行人士，現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。中心正繼續流行病學調查，並已把個案通報孟加拉國衞生當局。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於個案病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪的地點，加強防蚊滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


本港今年累計錄得四宗基孔肯雅熱個案，均屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

雖然基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，而病徵亦較登革熱輕微，大部分病人可以自行痊癒，但由於本地蚊媒未帶有基孔肯亞熱病毒，政府會全力預防基孔肯亞熱在本地扎根，已積極採取多項應急準備，包括：全面加強宣傳教育工作、加強口岸防控措施、提升本地檢測能力、安排患者在無蚊環境接受治療、就確診個案進行流行病學調查及風險評估、加強病媒調查及滅蚊等。中心的公共衞生化驗服務處具備充足的檢測能力。中心會為公立及私家醫院的基孔肯雅熱懷疑病例進行檢測。中心已聯同醫院管理局進一步提升本地檢測能力，確保本港一旦出現爆發，懷疑個案可盡快進行化驗，以達致早發現、早診斷。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。市民應繼續採取的措施:


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
如有需要，可於門窗裝上防蚊網，或在室內地方使用隔蚊簾或蚊帳；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
食環署聯同各相關部門及持份者加強雨後控蚊滅蚊工作,2025-08-06 19:05,2025-08-06 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600766.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）因應連日天雨，會繼續聯同各相關部門及持份者加強控蚊滅蚊工作，包括清除地盤及蚊患風險較高地點的積水、殺滅成蚊等，亦呼籲市民及持份者包括物業管理公司及建築地盤等，加強檢查及清除所屬地方的積水以防治蚊患。

食環署發言人今日（八月六日）表示，連場大雨過後在環境中施放的殺蟲劑會被沖走，各處積水亦增多，過往曾發現的積水及蚊子滋生地可能已轉移位置，食環署正繼續聯同各相關部門及持份者加強巡視區內大雨過後容易積水的風險較高地點，包括建築地盤、工地和過往誘蚊器曾錄得較高指數的地點。如發現有積水造成潛在蚊子滋生地會即時清理，並會於未能即時清除的積水處施放蚊沙等殺幼蟲劑，及於成蚊棲息處如茂密的樹木、陰暗隱蔽的地點及荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署亦已聯同各區區議會、分區民政事務處及各有關持份者加強宣傳教育，以及就區內的蚊子滋生衞生黑點（例如三無大廈的公共地方）開展聯合清理行動，以進一步遏止蚊子滋生。

八月正值香港的雨季，炎熱多雨的天氣有利蚊子迅速繁殖。食環署提醒市民及持份者須繼續防蚊工作，清除積水以減低蚊子滋生的機會。要有效防治蚊患，市民及各界的攜手合作不可或缺。

市民大眾應繼續保持警覺，於大雨期間及早於家居及其他環境採取特別防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括：


檢查家居環境（尤其戶外露天地方）會否出現積水容易導致蚊患；
檢查家居用品（尤其存放於戶外露天地方），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
蓋好水桶、水盆等貯水容器；及
最少每星期檢查及清理容易積水的地方，以阻斷蚊子的繁殖。


物業管理公司及學校的負責人應採取下列措施，以防止天雨導致蚊子滋生：


巡視物業／學校的公共地方會否出現大範圍積水，安排清理積水及把凹陷的地面填平；
檢查渠閘及渠口會否被枯葉或垃圾等堵塞，保持溝渠暢通；
檢查雨傘架、雨傘筒和冷氣機托盤，避免出現積水；
妥善棄置儲水容器，將垃圾放在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
大雨過後沙井蓋匙孔的填補物、膠紙或膠匙孔蓋等或會被雨水沖走，須重新以沙填補，或以膠匙孔蓋或膠紙覆蓋好；及
巡視綠化地帶包括花盆、花圃或園藝種植區等，清除積水以免造成蚊子滋生。


建築地盤的負責人亦應及早作出評估，以及切實執行有效措施以預防蚊患，當中包括：


於大雨期間及大雨過後巡視地盤範圍，確保沒有積水滋生蚊蟲。如出現大範圍積水，應盡快以水泵等工具將積水抽走；
檢查水馬或其他物品（例如遮蓋用的帆布）有否積水；竹棚的竹端用幼沙填塞或把竹端鑽穿，以防積水；及
若有積水難以清除，應適當施用蚊沙等殺幼蟲劑。


市民可參考食環署有關防控蚊患的網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html#），亦應持續留意衞生署衞生防護中心發出有關基孔肯雅熱的資訊。如有發現蚊患情況，請致電1823。"

青年發展委員會舉行第十九次會議（附圖）,2025-08-06 17:00,2025-08-06 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600615.htm,"政務司司長陳國基今日（八月六日）主持青年發展委員會第十九次會議。

會議上，民政及青年事務局（民青局）介紹了兩項培育青年人正向思維的資助計劃，即民青局青年正向思維活動資助計劃和民青局青年歷奇訓練活動資助計劃的情況。各委員欣悉計劃能協助青年全人發展，幫助他們提升自信，以積極的態度面對生活中的挑戰，繼而培育他們成為有擔當、有理想，願意為國家、為香港未來建設的新一代。

此外，房屋局介紹了一系列協助青年人置業，上進上流的措施。當中包括香港房屋委員會（房委會）由「白表居屋第二市場計劃2024」起增加1 500個配額並全數撥予40歲以下的青年申請者、為購買「居者有其屋計劃」單位的青年人分派多一個抽籤號碼等。各委員認為有關措施可鼓勵青年人選擇合適的房屋階梯上流，實踐置業夢想。

房屋局亦介紹了「共築・創業家」計劃。為鼓勵和支持青年實踐創業夢想，房委會於二○二四年推出此項創新計劃，在其轄下商場向青年提供為期7個月的免租金商舖，以供試行創業；隨後更將此理念擴展至私營商場，進一步推出「共築・創業家2.0」計劃，邀請商界夥伴攜手支持青年創業，並向計劃參加者於首階段完結後提供三年階梯式租金優惠。各委員認為，此計劃不僅能藉着年青人的活力與創新意念，為社區注入更多元化的購物體驗，更能有效地帶動商場人流，實現多方共贏的局面。

陳國基表示：「本屆政府十分重視青年發展，我期待繼續與各委員攜手並肩，以《青年發展藍圖》作為切入點，引領社會各界培育廣大青年成為愛國愛港、具備世界視野、有抱負和具正向思維的新一代。」"
衞生防護中心調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案,2025-08-06 17:00,2025-08-06 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600557.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月六日）正調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案，同時提醒市民時刻注意個人和環境衞生，以減低被傳染這種嚴重疾病的風險。

個案涉及一名57歲男子。他於七月三十一日在家中暈倒，同日經救護車送往明愛醫院急症室，並留院治療，翌日被轉送至廣華醫院。他的腦脊液樣本經化驗後，證實對腦膜炎雙球菌呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為腦膜炎。病人現時情況危殆。

初步調查顯示，病人潛伏期內沒有外遊，他的家居接觸者至今沒有出現病徵。中心已向其密切接觸者派發預防性藥物並繼續進行調查。

侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染是法定須呈報傳染病，截至今日，中心今年共錄得八宗個案。

腦膜炎雙球菌感染是由腦膜炎雙球菌所引起，主要經由直接接觸帶菌者的呼吸道分泌物（包括口鼻分泌物）而傳播。當細菌入侵血液（腦膜炎雙球菌血症）或包圍腦部及脊髓的內膜（流行性腦膜炎）時，可引致嚴重病症。腦膜炎雙球菌血症的病徵包括突發性發燒、劇烈頭痛、皮膚出現瘀斑及休克，嚴重者甚至會致命。流行性腦膜炎的病徵包括發高燒、劇烈頭痛、頸部僵硬及嗜睡，亦會有嘔吐、畏光或皮疹等情況出現，若情況嚴重更可造成腦部損害或死亡。

中心呼籲市民採取以下預防措施以預防腦膜炎雙球菌感染：


用梘液和清水正確洗手，尤其在雙手被呼吸道分泌物污染時，如打噴嚏後。當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，可用酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應掩着口鼻，用紙巾包裹痰涎，棄置於有蓋的垃圾桶內，並即時洗手；
避免到人多擠迫的地方；
避免與出現發燒或劇烈頭痛病徵的病人作親密接觸；
前往高危地區前，應諮詢醫生有關接種腦膜炎雙球菌疫苗的詳情；及
從高危地區返港後若感到不適，應立即求診，並告知醫生近期曾到訪的地區。


市民可參閱衞生防護中心網頁以取得更多有關腦膜炎雙球菌感染的資料。"
Youth Development Commission convenes 19th meeting (with photos),2025-08-06 17:00,2025-08-06 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600616.htm,"The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, chaired the 19th meeting of the Youth Development Commission (YDC) today (August 6).

At the meeting, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) introduced two funding schemes nurturing youth positive thinking, namely, the HYAB Funding Scheme for Youth Positive Thinking Activities and the HYAB Funding Scheme for Youth Adventure Training Activities. Members appreciated that the funding schemes are conducive to young people's whole-person development, enhancing their confidence, and helping them face challenges in life with a positive attitude, thereby nurturing them to become a new generation with a sense of responsibility and an aspiration and willingness to contribute to the development of the country and Hong Kong.

Furthermore, the Housing Bureau (HB) introduced a series of measures to help young people purchase their own flats and achieve upward mobility. These include different measures of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) to further assist young people, such as increasing the quota by 1 500 starting from the White Form Secondary Market Scheme 2024, all of which were allocated to young applicants aged below 40, allocating an extra ballot number to young people for the purchase of Home Ownership Scheme flats, etc. Members considered relevant measures effective in encouraging young people to move up the appropriate housing ladder and realise the dream of home ownership.

The HB also reported on the Well Being · Start-Up Programme. To encourage and support young people in pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams, the HA launched in 2024 the innovative programme to offer rent-free shops in its shopping centres for a seven-month period for young people to trial their business plans, and subsequently extended this vision to private shopping centres by launching the Well Being · Start-Up 2.0 Programme, inviting the commercial sector to collaborate in supporting young entrepreneurs and offering participants a three-year staged rental at discounted market rents after the first phase of the programme. Members concurred that this programme not only provides the community with more diverse shopping experiences through the vitality and innovative ideas of young people, but also effectively increases patronage in shopping centres, creating a win-win situation for all stakeholders.

CHP investigates case of invasive meningococcal infection,2025-08-06 17:00,2025-08-06 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600559.htm,"ããThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 6) is investigating a case of invasive meningococcal infection, and reminds the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of contracting this serious disease.

ããThe case involved a 57-year-old male, who collapsed at home on July 31. He was sent by ambulance to the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre and was admitted for treatment on the same day. He was transferred to Kwong Wah Hospital on the following day. His cerebrospinal fluid specimen tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was meningitis. The patient is now in a critical condition.

ããAn initial investigation revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. His household contacts have remained asymptomatic so far. The CHP has distributed preventive drugs to his close contacts and will continue the investigation.

ããMeningococcal infection is one of the statutory notifiable diseases. As of today, the CHP has recorded eight cases this year.

ããMeningococcal infection is caused by a bacterium known as meningococcus. It is mainly transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, of infected persons. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream (meningococcaemia) or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord (meningococcal meningitis). Meningococcaemia is characterised by a sudden onset of fever, an intense headache, purpura, shock and even death in severe cases. Meningococcal meningitis is characterised by high fever, severe headache, stiff neck followed by drowsiness, vomiting, fear of bright light, or rash; it can cause brain damage or even death.

ããTo prevent meningococcal infection, members of the public are advised to take the following measures:


Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly, especially when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing, and clean hands with alcohol-based handrub when they are not visibly soiled;
Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, hold the saliva with a tissue, dispose of nasal and mouth discharge in a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands immediately;
Avoid crowded places;
Avoid close contact with patients who have a fever or severe headache;
Consult doctors about meningococcal vaccination before travelling to high-risk areas; and
Seek medical advice if you become ill after returning from high-risk areas, and discuss your recent travel history with your doctor.

保安局局長在立法會《2025年監獄（修訂）規則》小組委員會會議開場發言（只有中文）,2025-08-06 16:21,2025-08-06 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600570.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（八月六日）出席立法會《2025年監獄（修訂）規則》小組委員會會議的開場發言：

主席:

首先，我非常感激小組委員會盡責履職，在暑假休會期間仍召開會議審議《2025年監獄（修訂）規則》。這項附屬法例已經在七月七日獲保安事務委員會的支持下，於七月十五日提交行政會議，並在七月十八日刊登憲報當日即時生效，及早防範和化解國家安全隱患。

在我跟大家介紹這項附屬法例前，我想指出，根據《5.28決定》（《全國人民代表大會關於建立健全香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制的決定》）和《香港國安法》的相關規定，香港特區有責任持續穩步完善維護國家安全的法律體系，達到持續有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動。加上《監獄規則》已實施超過70年，我們有必要檢視其是否切合維護國家安全和現代監獄管理的需要。在這個大前提下，保安局修訂《監獄規則》。

我們修訂《監獄規則》的政策原意包括以下三項：

（一）維護國家安全、持續鞏固懲教人員執行職務的法律基礎；
（二）強化懲教署執法效能；及
（三）令《監獄規則》更合時宜。

為達致這次修例的政策目的，我們就《監獄規則》的相關條文賦權懲教署可基於特定的目的，因應不同的情況對相關安排施加有需要的限制或禁止，防止有人濫用《監獄規則》的制度危害國家安全，對監獄的保安、秩序和紀律構成威脅，或妨礙在囚人士改過自新。這些特定目的，下稱「主要目的」，包括：

（一）維護國家安全；
（二）防止或偵查刑事罪行；
（三）令在囚人士改過自新；
（四）保障任何個人的人身安全；及
（五）維持監獄的保安、秩序和紀律。

圍繞上述政策原意，我們的修例方案涵蓋以下主要範疇。

首先，我們完善探訪在囚人士的制度，清楚反映立法原意，訂明除《監獄規則》另有規定外，任何在囚人士不得接受未獲懲教署署長授權的人的探訪；同時清楚訂明探訪的法定目的，必須是為了幫助相關在囚人士改過自新或為其重投社會作準備，而透過該探訪可以令有關的在囚人士能夠與其家庭或社會維持聯繫，或會為該位在囚人士帶來精神或物質上的支援，以達致上述的法定目的。懲教署有權拒絕任何不符合法定目的的探訪。同時，懲教署可為「主要目的」，而就某探訪施加限制等，以確保探訪制度受到有效規管。

考慮到懲教署署長可以根據法例，授權某人探視某名在囚人士，所以我們認為沒有必要保留《監獄規則》第51條（與因欠繳款項而被監禁的人為籌措欠款與朋友會晤相關的條文），和第205條（與候審在囚人士為籌措保釋而會見其親戚或朋友相關的條文）；換言之，署長可運用其權力授權某人為協助因欠繳款項而被監禁的人籌措欠款，或為協助候審在囚人士籌措保釋，而與相關的在囚人士探訪。因此，我們認為廢除上述條文是適當的。

在專職教士的探訪方面，我們賦權懲教署可就具體情況，考慮是否有需要為「主要目的」對個別專職教士和在囚人士的接觸或舉行的宗教活動施加限制或禁止等，以期強化監獄的保安和管理，並有效防範國家安全風險。值得注意的是，這項修訂並非要妨礙在囚人士行使宗教自由或參與宗教儀式，他們仍可接受其他專職教士探訪或參與未受限制或符合相關條件的專職教士活動。因此，在囚人士的宗教自由繼續得到充分保障。

第二，參照《維護國家安全條例》的相關措施，我們修訂《監獄規則》，讓懲教署可以為維護國家安全等特定情況所需，而根據裁判官發出的手令限制在囚人士與個別法律代表的聯繫，以更好維護國家安全和司法公正。由於機制允許在囚人士諮詢另一名由其選擇的法律代表，在囚人士依然享有秘密法律諮詢和選擇律師的權利，而法院會確保在法律程序的進行中，在囚人士會獲得公平審訊。

與此同時，參照上述因應危害國家安全等特定情況，可向裁判官申請就在囚人士與個別法律代表的聯繫施加適當限制的機制，我們對《監獄規則》作出修訂，就候審在囚人士和上訴人為進行辯護或上訴的目的，接受註冊醫生探訪訂定類同的機制，令懲教署可因應危害國家安全等特定情況向裁判官申請手令，就有關的探訪施加適當限制，而有關機制都會加入類同的程序保障。同樣地，相關的候審在囚人士或上訴人可為進行辯護或上訴的目的諮詢其他由其選擇的註冊醫生。

第三，是有關為在囚人士供應衣物的制度，和有關候審在囚人士穿着私人衣服和自備食物的制度。為令制訂在囚人士衣物準則的考慮因素更明確，我們清晰訂明懲教署為在囚人士供應制服的制度的目的，即為確保在囚人士的安全、舒適、健康和衞生；保障囚犯私隱；確保囚犯穿着合乎體統；確保在囚人士進行指定工作或其他活動時穿着得宜；和維持監獄的保安、秩序和紀律。

另外，基於監獄管理的實際需要，避免未獲授權物品被引入監獄的風險，我們廢除候審在囚人士可進食「私飯」和穿着私人衣服的制度。懲教署將繼續確保所有在囚人士的基本生活需求得到滿足，同時維護監獄的安全和秩序。

第四，我們在提出上述修訂的同時，亦修訂其他相關條文，清晰訂明懲教署人員行使與監獄管理相關的權力時，考慮的因素包括維護國家安全、維持監獄的保安、秩序和紀律等「主要目的」。這些修訂包括：在囚人士發出和收受信件的規定；審查在囚人士收發的信件；處置來自監獄以外的刊物；中止某名在囚人士與其他在囚人士交往；和向候審在囚人士供應消遣品的安排。

第五，我們強化懲教署的執法效能。參考涉及執法機關的法例，我們在《監獄規則》訂立類近的機制，防止有人抗拒或阻撓懲教署人員執行職務，確保他們可以執行確保安全羈押在囚人士、維持監獄保安和監獄運作的職責。違者即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處第1級罰款，即2,000元和監禁六個月。為配合相關機制，我們亦賦權懲教署人員可使用按理屬必需的武力去拘捕妨礙他們執行職務、作出或協助在囚人士逃走、參與騷亂等對監獄保安或人身安全構成嚴重威脅的行為的人，並可扣留被捕人，直至付交警務人員羈押，和賦權懲教署人員可以在按理屬必需的範圍內使用槍械以制止任何人作出剛才提及的違法行為。

懲教署人員在任何情況下使用武力或槍械都會嚴格遵守《監獄規則》的相關規定；一如任何可能需要使用武力或槍械的執法人員，懲教署亦制訂清晰的內部指引和武力使用階梯原則，同時配合充足的培訓，確保懲教人員只會在按理屬必需的範圍內，依法使用武力制止有關的違法行為和作出拘捕。

我們亦釐清懲教署人員為確保在囚人士在移送時或在監獄以外受合法羈押時得以穩妥地被羈押，可使用任何由行政長官批准的機械束縛器具，例如手銬、腳鐐等。

第六，我們同時亦作出令《監獄規則》更合時宜的修訂，包括：

（一）因應重塑後的區議會重回《基本法》下作為非政權性的區域諮詢和服務組織的定位，我們更新《監獄規則》內「指明的人」涵蓋的範圍，剔除「區議會議員」，使「指明的人」涵蓋的範圍限於其職責為有需要處理在囚人士就懲教署或其人員提出的申訴。修例後，懲教署會按《監獄規則》有關信件的一般條文，處理在囚人士與區議會議員之間的信件：即他們與在囚人士之間的書信不再享有免被開啓、搜查或閱讀的特權；及

（二）我們會廢除與體罰和死刑有關的過時條文。

我想強調，在提出修訂時，我們已充分考慮《基本法》，包括有關人權的條文。雖然在囚人士不會基於監禁而喪失所有《基本法》保障的權利，但他們所享有的權利並不等同於非在囚人士。當他們行使這些權利和自由時，必須受到基於維護國家安全、維護監獄保安、紀律和秩序等合法目的的需要而有所限制。

在制訂這次修例方案時，我們考慮到其他司法管轄區的法例都遵從這些基本原則，從而賦權當局因應某些合法目的對在囚人士的權利作出合理的限制。而且，正如我一直強調，修例方案內不同的條文，在其他實行普通法的司法管轄區，包括美西方國家等亦有類近的法律要求。特區政府的方案對任何基本權利和自由可能造成的限制，均基於上述的基本原則，並且屬合理、必需和相稱，並相應制訂適當的保障措施，在維護國家安全、保障公共安全及公眾秩序，和保障個人權利和自由之間取得合理平衡。

主席，香港特區有責任持續穩步完善維護國家安全的法律體系，「早一日，得一日」有效維護國家安全。修訂《監獄規則》在有效維護國家安全、持續鞏固懲教人員執行職務的法律基礎和強化懲教署執法效能方面有必要性。

現在歡迎各位議員發表意見。多謝主席。"

The restaurant, located at Shops A and B on the ground floor of Career Court on 56-58 Tonkin Street, was ordered to suspend business from today (August 6) to August 19.

""Two convictions for the above-mentioned breach were recorded against the restaurant licensee in May and June this year. A total fine of $7000 was levied by the court, and 30 demerit points were registered against the licensee under the department's demerit points system. The contraventions resulted in the 14-day licence suspension,"" a spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said.

The licensee concerned had a record of two convictions for the same offence in March and June last year. A total fine of $7,050 was levied, and 30 demerit points were also registered, leading to a seven-day licence suspension during September last year.

The spokesman reminded licensees of food premises to comply with the FBR, or their licences could be suspended or cancelled.

Licensed food premises are required to exhibit their licence and a sign at a conspicuous place of the premises, indicating that the premises has been licensed. A list of licensed food premises is available on the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/licensing/licence-foodPremises-search.html)."
