Launching ceremony of second-term Care Teams held today (with photos),2025-10-24 19:00,2025-10-24 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400608.htm,"âThe Home Affairs Department (HAD) today (October 24) held a launching ceremony for the second-term District Services & Community Care Teams (Care Teams) at the Central Government Offices. The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, accompanied by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, officiated at the ceremony.

At the launching ceremony, Mr Lee said that when he ran in the Chief Executive Election in 2022, he proposed in his election manifesto to set up Care Teams in the 18 districts. Care Teams had already become an integral part of the Government's efforts to improve district governance. Under the enhanced district governance structure, the District Councils, the ""three district committees"", and Care Teams each have well-defined roles while maintaining close co-ordination and synergy in helping those in need. This governance structure enables the Government services to be rooted in the community, reach out to the public and accurately and effectively provide relief measures and solutions. Each Care Team actively provided and organised caring and community activities, reached out and helped the underprivileged, disseminated government information, and assisted the Government in providing relief in times of incidents and emergencies. Mr Lee said the Care Teams serve without seeking reward and without fear of hardship, embodying the spirit of care and compassion.

To further support the work of Care Teams, the Government has set up three additional Care Teams in accordance with district needs and enhanced the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the second-term of service, enabling Care Teams to provide services and activities better tailored to district needs. Under a regularised mode of operation and with increased government funding, the second-term service of Care Teams will further extend the community support network. The Government will also enhance training for Care Teams and facilitate them to strengthen ties and co-operation with government departments, public utilities and district organisations. Mr Lee expressed his hope that the Care Teams would continue to carry forward the spirit and strength of unity, mutual support, resilience and inclusiveness.

Other officiating guests included the Under Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Mr Clarence Leung, and the Director of Home Affairs, Ms Priscilla To. District Officers of the 18 districts, who are the commanders of Care Teams in their districts, and the representative of all 455 Care Teams also attended the ceremony.

The first-term of Care Team services has completed and all KPIs have been met. Care Teams have made around 610 000 visits to elderly households and other households in need, provided close to 100 000 times of basic home or other support services, organised around 50 000 district-level activities, and their achievements are evident to all.The HAD and District Offices will consolidate the reports of the Care Teams in the first term and let the public know their achievements.

The second-term service of Care Teams will run till September 30, 2027. Building on the established district networks, Care Teams will continue to deepen and broaden their services to further enhance people's sense of satisfaction and well-being."

The theme for this year is ""A Decade of Collaboration Drives Energy Transitions for a Green Future "". At the High-level Dialogue Session titled ""Building a Forward-Looking Framework for Global Clean Energy Cooperation"", Mr Tse shared Hong Kong's strategies and progress in promoting regional energy collaboration.

Mr Tse introduced to the attendees the four major decarbonisation strategies outlined by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, namely net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport, and waste reduction, leading Hong Kong towards carbon neutrality.

  ""In terms of net-zero electricity generation, Hong Kong has gradually phased out coal for daily electricity generation since 1997 and aims to increase the share of zero-carbon energy in the fuel mix for electricity generation to about 60 per cent. We are also committed to measures such as ceasing new registration of fuel-propelled private cars before 2035 and moving away from the reliance on landfills for municipal solid waste management, aiming to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035 and carbon neutrality before 2050,"" Mr Tse said.

He also mentioned that the HKSAR formulated the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong last year to seize the opportunities brought about by the global development of hydrogen energy and create an environment conducive to the development of hydrogen energy in Hong Kong in a prudent and orderly manner. He said that he was looking forward to continuing to strengthen communication and collaboration with all parties involved in the development of new energy.

Mr Tse added that, Hong Kong, as the world's third-most competitive international financial centre and international centre for green and sustainable finance, can become a hub for green technologies and products, and provide professional services for green development worldwide to work together to promote regional low-carbon green transformation.

After the meeting, Mr Tse signed the Cooperation Arrangement on Promoting Interconnectivity of Charging Facilities in the Greater Bay Area with Deputy Administrator of the National Energy Administration of China Mr Song Hongkun.

Under the Arrangement, the Environment and Ecology Bureau and the NEA will establish a joint working group to develop a roadmap for the demonstration project of the new electric vehicle charging technology, called ChaoJi, in Hong Kong and confirm the implementation details, which include conducting technical discussions with experts on the research, development, and certification of relevant adapters, as well as preparing for the next stage of work.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Mr Tse said, ""By collaborating with the National Energy Administration to implement the Arrangement, the introduction of a pilot scheme in Hong Kong using the ChaoJi charging standard will help the HKSAR to address the issue of different electric vehicle charging standards between the two places in the long run, promote the construction of supporting infrastructure for new energy vehicles, and enhance the interconnectivity and green low-carbon transportation development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, as well as to showcase the technical standard advantages of ChaoJi to the world, aiding the global advancement of China's electric vehicle technology and charging standards.

Mr Tse will return to Hong Kong tomorrow (October 25)."

Mr Chung (Deputy Minister of the International Legal Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, Mr Chung Hong-sik), Mr Jeong (Executive Director of the Trade Promotion Group of the Korea International Trade Association, Mr Jeong Hee-cheol), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is my great honour and pleasure to welcome you all to the 2nd Joint Legal Workshop organised by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, the Department of Justice of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, the Korea International Trade Association and the Korea In-House Counsel Association. Our theme today is ""Strengthening Business and Legal Cooperation: Korea and Hong Kong"". Building on the success of our first legal workshop held in Hong Kong in July last year, this event marks a significant step forward in our ongoing partnership.

Korea has always been a close partner of Hong Kong. In 2024, Korea was Hong Kong's fifth largest trading partner. The total merchandise trade between Hong Kong and Korea reached HK$355.9 billion in 2024, representing a nearly 20 per cent increase from the previous year. This reflects the deepening economic exchanges and expanding opportunities between our two regions.

To facilitate these increasing exchanges and the exploration of these opportunities, and to safeguard the rights and interests of all relevant stakeholders, it is plain and obvious that reliable, high-quality and user-friendly legal and dispute resolution services are indispensable. This is precisely what Hong Kong may and can offer.

Under the fundamental principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction in the People's Republic of China. It is also the only bilingual common law jurisdiction in the world using both English and Chinese. We have an independent judiciary with the power of final adjudication, business-friendly civil and commercial laws familiar to the international community, and a large pool of lawyers with extensive international experience and expertise in different areas. These legal professionals provide seamless, one-stop services across a wide range of matters covering the whole business cycle, from the formation of a business entity (including the raising of capital by public listing) to the realisation of profits derived from a business venture.

Fair and efficient dispute resolution services constitute an essential component of risk management. Apart from traditional litigations, alternative dispute resolution including arbitration and mediation have become increasingly important in international trade and investment. Hong Kong has all along been well regarded as one of the top international arbitration centres in the world. According to the 2025 International Arbitration Survey conducted by Queen Mary University of London, Hong Kong ranks as the second most preferred seat for arbitration globally and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2024, 76.4 per cent of the arbitrations submitted to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre were international in nature.

Turning to mediation, the establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong demonstrates the city's unique advantages and opportunities in international mediation. The IOMed is the world's first intergovernmental international legal organisation dedicated to resolving international disputes, including disputes between a country and another country, a country and foreign nationals, as well as international commercial disputes, through mediation. The headquarters of IOMed has been established in Hong Kong, and IOMed formally opened a few days ago on October 20. We are also excited to share the news that we will construct the Hong Kong International Legal Service Building, adjacent to the IOMed headquarters, to house international legal and dispute resolution services institutions so as to further support Hong Kong's strategic position as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution.

A unique and significant advantage enjoyed by Hong Kong is its close connection with the legal system in the Chinese Mainland. Up to the present, Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland have signed nine mutual legal assistance arrangements, including mutual recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments as well as arbitral awards; and the grant of interim measures in arbitrations, which is extremely useful in practice. All in all, Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services may be conveniently used to facilitate the exploitation of investment and business opportunities in the Chinese Mainland. This is why we say Hong Kong indeed serves as a gateway between China and the rest of the world.

Looking ahead, the Department of Justice is eager to continue building on the strong foundation of partnership we have with Korea. On this basis, I would like to take the opportunity to invite all of you to join us at our annual flagship event — Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 — which will be held from December 1 to 5, 2025, in Hong Kong.

Last but not least, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our co-organisers of the workshop, the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, the Korea International Trade Association and the Korea In-House Counsel Association for their efforts in making this workshop possible; and, of course, all our distinguished speakers who will share their valuable insights in the two panel discussions. I wish you all a very productive and inspiring session ahead. Thank you."

The two passengers concerned were both convicted and sentenced to 10 weeks' imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (October 24) for contravening the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) (Cap. 60).

Customs officers intercepted the two male passengers, both aged 28, on September 20 at the Arrival Hall at HKIA for Customs clearance. Upon examination, the pharmaceutical injections were found inside their respective personal baggage.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds the public not to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong.

Under the IEO, any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

這次考察活動由中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室主持和統籌，我們非常感謝他們這次這麼細緻統籌這個活動；同時感謝北京市人民政府、河北省人民政府的精心安排。

這次香港特區代表團一行40多人，考察了北京城巿副中心，還有雄安新區。我們考察的內容包括他們的規劃建設和產業發展的經驗。我們希望通過這次考察，有助加速推動北部都會區（北都）的招商引資和發展工作。

代表團除了特區政府的官員和相關部門的代表外，也有多個非官方機構和工商金融界的代表，更有香港八家大學的高層管理人員一起參加。在過去兩、三天的時間，我們在北京城市副中心和河北雄安新區，考察了12個地點，涵蓋了商務區域、科創基地、交通樞紐、大學校區、文化設施、以至便民的綜合服務中心等。我們也參觀了亮馬河和京杭大運河的北京段，了解它們保育、活化與發展之間並存且相互促進的發展模式。

這次考察，對香港可以說是深有啓發。我想提出三點。

第一是兩個區充分展示了非常磅礴的規劃視野，以「一張藍圖繪到底」的戰略定力，加上強大的統籌力和執行力，讓建設和發展全速推進。經過充分論證，把好方向，抓準定位，就全力、全速去做。兩個區的基建，建設速度和質量都讓人感到讚嘆，這裏面涉及不單是硬體的建設，更重要是規劃和建設之間的統籌和全過程高效管理，也包括體制的改革創新。在香港，我們正在推動北部都會區的發展，在行政長官《施政報告》中，提出成立北都發展委員會，下面設有三個工作組，我們也希望通過優化頂層設計，抓緊落實，讓北都的發展加快貫徹落實。未來如何進一步加快北都的產業發展，剛才我說到我們去考察兩個區，它們的經驗能為我們提供很多具體的參考。

第二是北京城巿副中心和雄安新區，兩個區的「片區開發」、產業布局、招商引資的經驗，為我們提供了重要的參考。我們看到在這兩個區的建設中，政府主導規劃，市場和企業亦積極配合推動和落實，公私營攜手聯動，把產業群聚好，把人才引進來。

第三是如何建設更有溫度的社區，這兩個區除了着重提供發展空間，基礎建設以人民為中心，重視為市民創造優質的生活環境。比如說，北京城市圖書館、亮馬河和大運河的工程等，都成為北京市民喜歡、很好的文化和休閒區域；人民大學通州校區的建設，就運用數據推出了許多人性化的設計和安排。

此外，我們正為北部都會區大學城積極謀劃，這次參觀了兩家大學在北京副中心和雄安新區的校區，它們在區域規劃布局、校園建設以至智慧校園管理等方面，也給我們提供了很好的經驗。

北京城市副中心跟雄安新區是京津冀協同發展的新的「兩翼」。在香港、粵港澳大灣區的發展，北部都會區是一個重點平台，一方面作為香港未來發展招商引資的重要載體，同時也是香港在粵港澳大灣區之中，發揮貢獻國家發展大局的重要平台。這次參考兩個地方的經驗，讓我們對下一步推動香港跟深圳以至大灣區兄弟城市的優勢互補、聯動發展，提供很好的參考。在「一國兩制」下，香港也可以為北京城市副中心和雄安新區提供我們獨特的支持。香港是一個很國際化的大都會，除了國際金融中心以外，我們也匯聚了國際人才、數據、信息，這些對北京與河北的企業出海發展也提供支持。兩地的企業出海的時候，我們很歡迎他們以香港作為首選的平台，用好我們在資金、人才、數據、專業服務等方面優勢，支持它們在海外成功發展。

接下來，我們請代表團的其他成員發言，謝謝。

記者：財爺，你好，想問參觀了副中心和雄安新區後，對北部都會區的建設有沒有新想法或調整？這兩個地方的建設是非常高速和高質量，但人們搬進來和要徹底發展，其實都需要較長時間。參觀後，預計北部都會區建成後要多久才能達到預期的效果和功能？

財政司司長：今次到此考察，當然它們給予我們一些新的看法，同時在香港推進北部都會區的發展，做法跟這邊也是高度契合，例如引進企業的範疇。在香港，推動創科發展的四大範疇，一個是人工智能和數據科學，另一個是醫療科技、生命健康。這次參觀的兩個地方，都是在這兩個範疇重點吸引企業，所以印證了大家對於創科帶來的變革，創科大潮未來的發展的認識和掌握是一致的。至於可以互相借鏡的地方，就是我們如何去吸引這些企業。在香港，剛才提到行政長官設立了北部都會區發展委員會，他親自掛帥當主席，轄下設有幾個小組去抓落實。其中包括在我的小組會研究招商引資時，做法是否可以創新一點；又例如在「片區開發」時，「片區開發」的內容亦可以是很有彈性，很多方面的。假設一個相當有實力的龍頭企業，來到時不只是投資，都會帶其產業鏈的上、中、下游的其他企業一起來，是一個產業群聚的情況，這個我們都非常歡迎。

在政策方面，包括如何批地；會否有些人才，如果本港尚未能及時培育，人才方面的需要要如何配合；以至特區政府會否作一些共同投資，表示企業符合我們的政策方向，亦是我們大力支持的範疇。我們可以作為一個小股東參與其中，確保其發展方向符合我們產業發展等。所以在推動企業落戶發展產業，我們是多方面、很有彈性的。

記者：司長，你好。這次的考察由港澳辦主導，他們有沒有在參觀當中提供甚麼指示？例如北部都會區應該如何發展。剛才你提到，北部都會區很着重頂層設計，回到香港後會否有更多思考，可能政府要更為主導發展計劃多一點，而非讓市場自由定奪？四中全會提到要發展新興產業，例如氫能、生物製造，在北部都會區發展時是否會配合？有新的想法？

財政司司長：在今次這個考察中，我們非常感謝中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室幫助我們組織安排，中間有大量協調統籌的工作。在考察期間，港澳辦徐啟方主任（中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室分管日常工作的副主任徐啟方）亦有陪同我們一起，亦在過程中解釋一些內地的做法，大家互相有交流。

至於在北部都會區的發展中，香港的空間規劃，譬如哪些地方用作甚麼用途、哪些用作發展產業、哪些用作保育、哪些是文化旅遊產業等，這個香港一直以來都有做，而且做得相當不錯。如果說有甚麼我們要加把勁的地方，就是假設某個空間規劃是用作產業發展，應用作哪種產業發展？在規劃空間的時候，有時我們會留多些彈性，較少很具體地說。近年我們則多講一點，譬如在落馬洲河套區，我們認為可與深圳合作，充分利用雙方的優勢，在當中，香港國際化的優勢十分明顯；而內地的優勢是應用場景，以及比較全面的生產鏈，大家聯動發展。

現時最重要的是為北部都會區訂定發展甚麼產業後，更積極主動地去看看哪些企業是我們的目標企業，邀請他們來。以至有些企業聞說香港北部都會區的發展，它想過來發展，這個包括內地企業，亦包括歐洲企業，例如製藥公司。

在過程當中，大家會商討落地條件和他們引進的項目、投資多大、帶領多少人、未來發展規模為何。我們在這方面會與他們鎖得比較實，在過程中會研究其整體對香港的貢獻，我們才會落實給他們某些優惠條件。大致上會這樣做。

四中全會提出了國家未來發展的重點方向。我們同時亦必須認識，香港是一個很細小的地方，只有七百多萬人，但我們有優勢——「一國兩制」下的國際化等各樣優勢。我們要推進發展時，主要是兩大方向，用好我們優勢。第一個是香港的優勢產業，我們要繼續鞏固提升自身長處，例如國際金融中心和貿易中心。

然而，在這個過程中，部分傳統優勢產業可能都要轉營，譬如國際金融中心，並不限於股市。例如綠色可持續金融，這是未來一個很大的發展方向；例如資產管理、財富管理，這是另外一個發展方向。在國際貿易方面，我們都可以鞏固提升，例如做區域供應鏈的管理。

第二個方向，就是培育新產業，令整個經濟結構能夠多元化。當經濟結構較多元化。無論外間的經濟周期如何，我們的應對都比較有靭性。同時，亦為我們的市民提供較多優質的就業選擇和機會。創科是我們的選擇，當中有四大範疇：人工智能大數據、生命健康和醫療健康、金融科技，以及新材料和新能源。這四大範疇中，目前來說，在人工智能大數據和醫療健康生命科技方面，優勢更明顯，海內外企業的興趣更大，這方面我們會加速推動。

培育創科能夠對我們的GDP（本地生產總值）作出更明顯的貢獻，當然需要一些時間，但我相信大家見到在過去一段時間，香港社會上擁抱創科的氛圍大有改善。大學收錄的同學，讀數理的亦多了很多；在招商引資的過程中，吸引到的重點企業都以創科企業為主。情況大致上是這樣。

多謝大家今日抽時間到來，多謝各位。"

Among the fifth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 12 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas in October, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released five batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 44 survey areas. Among these 44 survey areas, 32 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Twelve other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

十月份第五批涵蓋12個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及九個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共五批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共44個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這44個監察區中，32個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有12區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。
​
食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
"""Immersive Hong Kong"" roving exhibition opens in Chengdu (with photos)",2025-10-24 16:52,2025-10-24 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400453.htm,"  The ""Immersive Hong Kong"" roving exhibition, organised by the Information Services Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government to showcase the diversity and latest developments of Hong Kong through interactive art technology, opened in Chengdu today (October 24).

  Co-organised with the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Chengdu, the exhibition, themed ""Hong Kong - Where the World Looks Ahead"", invites visitors from Chengdu and throughout Sichuan Province to explore the unique opportunities and potential for tourism, education, business and investment in Hong Kong.

  The exhibition enables visitors to delve into different virtual scenes representing the city, with a creative twist. The five thematic zones are ""Financial Bridgehead"", ""I&T Brain Bank"", ""Blossoming Creativity"", ""Diversity and Greenery"" and ""Buzzing Sports Action"". They feature multiple interactive art projections, light box installations and naked-eye 3D displays, representing the distinctive appeal of Hong Kong.

  Visitors may also enjoy Hong Kong's vibrant and colourful skyline, illustrated by Hong Kong artist Messy Desk (Jane Lee), at a photo corner in the venue. Promotional videos and digital panels presenting information about the city, as well as insights from Chinese Mainland companies about their experiences in Hong Kong are also on display, highlighting why the city is one of the most desirable places to visit, study, live, work and invest.

  Speaking at the opening ceremony today, the Director of Information Services, Mrs Apollonia Liu, noted that this year marks the 10th anniversary edition of the Belt and Road Summit organised by the HKSAR. As such, three node cities along the Belt and Road on the Mainland were selected to hold the exhibition. The first two stops were successfully held in Shanghai and Qingdao respectively, attracting a total of almost 300 000 visitors.

  ""We are delighted to bring the roving exhibition to Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan,"" Mrs Liu said. ""Since the establishment of the Hong Kong/Sichuan Co-operation Conference mechanism in 2018, the co-operation and communication between Sichuan and Hong Kong have been strengthening steadily. The two places have reached consensus on strengthening various co-operation areas, including the economic, trade, and the Belt and Road Initiative. Data from 2024 shows that Hong Kong is Sichuan's largest source of external investment and the fourth-largest export area. As of May 2025, more than 40 Sichuan enterprises have been listed in Hong Kong.""

  Mrs Liu added that Sichuan is the world's largest and most complete habitat for giant pandas. The giant panda is a national treasure that embodies profound Chinese culture and ecological significance, connecting compatriots from the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong citizens. The six giant pandas in Hong Kong, including four from Chengdu and a pair of twins born to two of them, are beloved by both residents and tourists. As such, the exhibition has incorporated elements of the giant panda for visitors in Chengdu to learn more about the pandas in Hong Kong.

  Mrs Liu pointed out that Hong Kong and Chengdu are both sports event hubs, staging high-quality events this year. In August, Chengdu hosted the 2025 World Games for the first time, while Hong Kong will cohost the 15th National Games with Guangdong and Macao next month. The ""Buzzing Sports Action"" thematic zone of the exhibition serves as pre-event publicity for the National Games.

  To enhance Chengdu residents' understanding of Hong Kong's arts and cultural landmark - the West Kowloon Cultural District, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority has also set up a display area at the venue. It showcases the unique features of the cultural district through engaging ways such as a photo corner and a capsule toy game.

  A Hong Kong pop music concert by SENZA A Cappella will also be staged at the exhibition venue this weekend.

  Mrs Liu expressed hope that the exhibition would spark the interest of friends from Chengdu to learn more about Hong Kong and visit the city. She also said she hopes that Sichuan and Hong Kong would continue to leverage on and integrate their unique advantages to foster win-win co-operation outcomes in various fields.

  During the exhibition, visitors can take part in an interactive game, ""Snap a cool shot @Immersive Hong Kong"", with exciting prizes on offer. Prizes include two pairs of round-trip business or economy class air tickets from Chengdu to Hong Kong sponsored by Cathay Pacific, and sets of six giant panda figurines. Visitors playing digital interactive games at the exhibition can also receive souvenirs.

  The exhibition is being held at the MixC, a major shopping centre in Chengdu, until November 2. Admission is free.

  Chengdu is the eighth stop of the exhibition, following successful events in seven cities on the Chinese Mainland, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Middle East between July 2023 and July 2025.

  Supporting organisations of the exhibition include the Belt and Road Office of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Hong Kong Talent Engage, Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Kai Tak Sports Park and the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority.

  More information on the exhibition is available on thededicated pageon the Brand Hong Kong website and theHong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Chengdu website."
「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽在成都舉行（附圖）,2025-10-24 16:49,2025-10-24 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400431.htm,"由香港特別行政區政府新聞處（新聞處）舉辦的「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽今日（十月二十四日）在成都展開，利用互動藝術科技，展示香港的多元面貌和最新發展。

展覽主題為「香港─實踐理想，開創未來」，由新聞處與香港特別行政區政府駐成都經濟貿易辦事處合辦，旨在讓成都以至四川省民眾通過展覽，探索香港在旅遊、教育、營商和投資方面的獨特機遇和潛力。

「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽設有五個主題展區，分別為「國際金融中心」、「創新及科技樞紐」、「澎湃創意之都」、「多元和綠色城市」及「體育動感之都」，各有代表香港的虛擬場景，為參觀者提供沉浸式體驗，透過多重互動藝術投影、燈箱和裸眼3D裝置，呈現香港的獨特魅力。

參觀者亦可透過香港本地藝術家Messy Desk（李美欣）的插畫設計，在拍照區感受香港充滿活力和璀璨的海濱面貌。展覽場地同時播放香港宣傳短片和設有數碼展板，介紹香港多項資訊，以及內地企業在香港的體驗，向參觀者展示香港作為全球最適合旅遊、就學、居住、工作和投資的城市之一所具備的元素。

新聞處處長廖李可期在今日舉行的開幕禮上致辭時表示，今年適逢香港特別行政區舉辦「一帶一路高峰論壇」10周年，新聞處特別在內地三個「一帶一路」的節點城市舉行展覽：首兩站已在上海及青島圓滿舉行，吸引近30萬名民眾參觀。

她說：「今天我們很高興把巡迴展覽帶來四川省省會成都。自二○一八年川港合作會議機制成立以來，四川和香港兩地的合作和溝通一直穩步發展，兩地已就加強多個領域的合作達成共識，當中包括『一帶一路』建設及經貿；而二○二四年的數據顯示，香港是四川最大的境外投資來源地和第四大出口地區，另外截至二○二五年五月底，在香港上市的四川省企業累計超過40家。」

廖李可期又指，四川是全球最大、最完整的大熊貓棲息地，而大熊貓不但是國寶，承傳着深厚的中華文化和生態意義，同時也連繫了內地同胞和香港市民。在香港的六隻大熊貓，包括來自成都的四隻大熊貓和由其中兩隻誕下的龍鳳胎，深得市民和遊客喜愛，今次的展覽也特別加入大熊貓的元素，讓成都的朋友們都可以有機會認識一下香港的大熊貓。

在體育方面，她說成都和香港同是「體育動感之都」，高水準的體壇盛事今年在兩地輪流上演，繼成都八月首次承辦世界運動會後，香港亦將於下月與廣東省和澳門攜手合辦第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）。展覽為此特設體育展區，作為全運會的預熱宣傳。

為了讓成都民眾更認識香港的文化藝術地標——西九文化區，香港西九文化區管理局同時在展覽場地設置展區，以打卡裝置及扭蛋遊戲等生動方式，展示文化區的特色。

本周末更有香港無伴奏合唱組合SENZA A Cappella在展覽場地獻唱精彩的香港流行歌曲。

廖李可期希望透過展覽讓更多成都朋友認識香港、到訪香港，並期望川港兩地能繼續善用並連接各自的獨特優勢，在不同領域合作共贏。

此外，展覽期間亦會舉行「酷遊香港─沉浸式之旅」快拍留影互動遊戲，勝出者有機會獲得由國泰航空贊助的雙人來回成都至香港的商務或經濟客艙機票，以及一套六隻的大熊貓盲盒。現場參與電子互動遊戲的人士，亦可以獲得精緻紀念品。

展覽於成都大型商場萬象城舉行，免費入場，展期至十一月二日。

成都是巡迴展覽的第八站，此前已於二○二三年七月至二○二五年七月期間在內地、東南亞國家聯盟和中東共七個城市成功舉行。

是次展覽的支持機構包括商務及經濟發展局「一帶一路」辦公室、香港人才服務辦公室、國泰航空、香港貿易發展局、香港旅遊發展局、啟德體育園及香港西九文化區管理局。

Business expectations for the fourth quarter of 2025,2025-10-24 16:30,2025-10-24 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102300777.htm,"The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (October 24) the results of the Quarterly Business Tendency Survey for the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2025.

Business Situation

For all surveyed sectors taken together, the proportion of respondents expecting their business situation to be better (13%) in Q4 2025 over the preceding quarter is slightly lower than that expecting it to be worse (15%).

When compared with the results of the Q3 2025 survey round, the proportion of respondents expecting a better business situation in Q4 2025 is 13%, higher than the corresponding proportion in Q3 2025 (10%). At the same time, the proportion of respondents expecting a worse business situation had decreased from 18% in Q3 2025 to 15% in Q4 2025.

Analysed by sector, respondents in quite a number of the surveyed sectors expect their business situation to decrease on balance in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025. In particular, significantly more respondents in the construction sector expect their business situation to be worse in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025. On the other hand, in the retail, financing and insurance and accommodation and food services sectors, more respondents expect their business situation to be better, as compared to those expecting it to be worse.

The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. In this type of survey on expectations, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the future accords with the underlying trends. The enumeration period for this survey round was from September 2, 2025 to October 10, 2025.

Volume of Business / Output

Analysed by sector, the number of surveyed sectors with respondents expecting their volume of business/output to decrease on balance in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025 is broadly the same as the number of surveyed sectors expecting their volume of business/output to increase. In particular, more respondents in the construction, information and communications and manufacturing sectors expect their volume of construction output/business/production to decrease in Q4 2025 over Q3 2025. On the contrary, in the real estate, retail, accommodation and food services and financing and insurance sectors, more respondents expect their volume of business/sales to increase, as compared to those expecting it to decrease.

Employment

Respondents in quite a number of the surveyed sectors expect their employment to remain broadly unchanged in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025. However, more respondents in the retail and professional and business services sectors expect their employment to decrease in Q4 2025 over Q3 2025. In the manufacturing and real estate sectors, on the other hand, more respondents expect their employment to increase, as compared to those expecting it to decrease.

Selling Price / Service Charge

Respondents in most of the surveyed sectors expect their selling prices/service charges to remain broadly unchanged in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025. However, significantly more respondents in the construction sector expect their tender prices to go down in Q4 2025 over Q3 2025.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that the overall near-term business outlook among large enterprises improved for the fourth quarter of 2025. The hiring appetite was largely steady on the whole.

Looking forward, the spokesman said that local business sentiment will be well underpinned by the sustained expansion in various segments of the Hong Kong economy, notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainties in the external environment. The Government will monitor the situation closely.

Further Information

The survey gathers views on short-term business performance from the senior management of about 560 prominent companies in various sectors in Hong Kong with a view to providing a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for predicting the short-term future economic performance of the local economy.

The survey covers 10 major sectors in Hong Kong, namely manufacturing; construction; import / export trade and wholesale; retail; accommodation and food services (mainly covering services rendered by hotels and restaurants); transportation, storage and courier services; information and communications; financing and insurance; real estate; and professional and business services sectors.

Views collected in the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own companies rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in, and are limited to the expected direction of quarter-to-quarter change (e.g. ""up"", ""same"" or ""down"") but not the magnitude of change. In collecting views on the quarter-to-quarter changes, if the variable in question is subject to seasonal variations, respondents are asked to provide the expected changes after excluding the normal seasonal variations.

Survey results are generally presented as ""net balance"", i.e. the difference between the percentage of respondents choosing ""up"" and that choosing ""down"". The percentage distribution of respondents among various response categories (e.g. ""up"", ""same"" and ""down"") reflects how varied their business expectations are. The ""net balance"", with its appropriate sign, indicates the direction of expected change in the variable concerned. A positive sign indicates a likely upward trend while a negative sign indicates a likely downward trend. However, the magnitude of the ""net balance"" reflects only the prevalence of optimism or pessimism, but not the magnitude of expected change, since information relating to such magnitude is not collected in the survey.

Furthermore, owing to sample size constraint, care should be taken in interpreting survey results involving a small percentage (e.g. less than 10%) of respondents in individual sectors.

Chart 1 shows the views on expected changes in business situation for the period Q4 2024 to Q4 2025.

Table 1 shows the net balances of views on expectations in respect of different variables for Q4 2025.

The survey results are published in greater detail in the ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey, Q4 2025"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110008&scode=300).

二零二五年第四季業務展望,2025-10-24 16:30,2025-10-24 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102300770.htm,"政府統計處今日（十月二十四日）發表二零二五年第四季業務展望按季統計調查的結果。

業務狀況

綜合是項統計調查所涵蓋的行業而言，預期二零二五年第四季的業務狀況較上一季為佳的受訪者（13%）比預期較差者（15%）所佔的比例略低。

與二零二五年第三季統計調查的結果比較，預期二零二五年第四季的業務狀況較上一季為佳的受訪者的比例為13%，較二零二五年第三季的相應比例（10%）為高。同時，預期業務狀況較上一季為差的受訪者的比例由二零二五年第三季的18%下降至二零二五年第四季的15%。

按行業分析，在不少涵蓋行業中，受訪者總體而言預期二零二五年第四季的業務狀況較二零二五年第三季為差。尤其在建造業中，有顯著較多的受訪者預期二零二五年第四季其業務狀況較二零二五年第三季為差。另一方面，在零售業、金融及保險業，以及住宿及膳食服務業中，預期其業務狀況較佳的受訪者則比預期較差者為多。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。就這類有關展望的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對將來的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這一輪統計調查的訪問期由二零二五年九月二日至二零二五年十月十日。

業務／產出量

按行業分析，受訪者總體而言預期二零二五年第四季的業務／產出量較二零二五年第三季下降的行業數目，與預期業務／產出量上升的行業數目大致相同。尤其在建造業、資訊及通訊業，以及製造業中，有較多的受訪者預期二零二五年第四季其建造工程完成量／業務量／生產量較二零二五年第三季下降。相反，在地產業、零售業、住宿及膳食服務業，以及金融及保險業中，有較多的受訪者預期其業務量／銷售量較二零二五年第三季上升。

就業

在不少涵蓋行業中，受訪者總體而言預期二零二五年第四季的從業人數較二零二五年第三季大致維持不變。然而，在零售業和專業及商用服務業中，有較多的受訪者預期二零二五年第四季其從業人數較二零二五年第三季下降。另一方面，在製造業和地產業中，預期其從業人數上升的受訪者則比預期下降者為多。

貨品售價／服務收費

在大部分涵蓋行業中，受訪者總體而言預期二零二五年第四季的貨品售價／服務收費較二零二五年第三季大致維持不變。然而，在建造業中，有顯著較多的受訪者預期二零二五年第四季其投標價格較二零二五年第三季下降。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第四季大型企業的整體短期業務前景有所改善。招聘意欲總體大致平穩。

展望未來，發言人指出，儘管外圍環境的不確定因素持續，香港經濟多個環節持續擴張，將為本地營商氣氛提供有力支持。政府會密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

這項統計調查搜集香港各行業中約560間大規模公司的高級管理人員對短期業務表現的意見，以在最短時間內，就預測本地不久將來的經濟表現提供快捷的參考。

這項統計調查涵蓋香港十個主要行業，分別是製造業，建造業，進出口貿易及批發業，零售業，住宿及膳食服務業（主要包括酒店及餐館提供的服務），運輸、倉庫及速遞服務業，資訊及通訊業，金融及保險業，地產業，以及專業及商用服務業。

統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己公司情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見；以及只限於預期季度間變動的方向（如「上升」、「不變」或「下降」），而並非變動的幅度。搜集季度間變動的意見時，如有關項目受季節性影響，受訪者會提供撇除正常季節性變動後的預期變動。

統計調查結果一般以「淨差額」表示，即填報「上升」的公司百分比減去填報「下降」的公司百分比。填報不同回應組別（如「上升」、「不變」及「下降」）的公司的百分比分布反映他們對業務展望的差異程度。「淨差額」的正負符號反映該項目的預期變動的方向。正數反映有關項目有可能上升的趨勢，而負數則反映有可能下降的趨勢。不過，正或負數值只反映受訪者樂觀或悲觀的普遍程度，而非預期變動的幅度，因這項統計調查並沒有搜集有關該幅度的資料。

此外，由於樣本規模有所局限，在個別行業中，涉及小數值的公司百分比（如小於10%）的統計調查結果，須謹慎闡釋。

圖1顯示於二零二四年第四季至二零二五年第四季期間有關業務狀況預期變動的意見。

  Compared with the grading released last week, Butterfly Beach and Deep Water Bay Beach have been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1. Middle Bay Beach and Silverstrand Beach have been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2, and Approach Beach from Grade 2 to Grade 3.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 23 to noon today (October 24), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 173 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 52 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

政府新聞處處長在成都出席「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽開幕禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-24 15:05,2025-10-24 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400427.htm,"以下是政府新聞處處長廖李可期今日（十月二十四日）在成都出席「香港—沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽開幕禮的致辭全文：

尊敬的馬聰副主任（四川省人民政府港澳事務辦公室副主任）、李明副主任（成都市人民政府港澳事務辦公室副主任）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

早上好！歡迎大家出席由香港特別行政區政府新聞處主辦、駐成都經濟貿易辦事處協辦的「香港─沉浸式之旅」展覽——成都站的開幕式。

這個展覽自二○二三年七月已經先後在印尼、泰國、馬來西亞，還有內地的廣州，跟阿聯酋迪拜舉行。今年適逢香港特別行政區舉辦「一帶一路高峰論壇」10周年，我們特別在內地三個「一帶一路」的節點城市舉行展覽：首兩站已在上海及青島圓滿舉行，吸引近30萬名民眾參觀。

今天我們很高興把巡迴展覽帶來四川省省會成都。自二○一八年川港合作會議機制成立以來，四川和香港兩地的合作和溝通一直穩步發展，兩地已就加強多個領域的合作達成共識，當中包括「一帶一路」建設及經貿；而二○二四年的數據顯示，香港是四川最大的境外投資來源地和第四大出口地區。另外，截至二○二五年五月底，在香港上市的四川省企業累計超過40家。除了頻密來往香港與成都天府國際機場的航班，香港直達成都的高鐵列車在二○二三年開通，令兩地距離越來越近，川港兩地合作更見成果。

說到四川省，我們當然要提大熊貓，因為四川是全球最大、最完整的大熊貓棲息地。大熊貓是國寶，承傳着深厚的中華文化和生態意義，同時也連繫了內地的同胞和香港市民。我們衷心感謝中央政府贈送大熊貓給香港，大熊貓「安安」、「可可」去年從位於成都的中國大熊貓保護研究中心都江堰基地來到香港展開牠們的新生活；而早年前來香港的大熊貓「盈盈」和「樂樂」也於去年誕下可愛的大熊貓龍鳳胎「加加」和「得得」。這六隻大熊貓深得香港市民和遊客喜愛，為香港帶來很多歡樂。為此，今次的展覽也特別加入大熊貓的元素，讓成都的朋友們都可以有機會認識一下我們香港的大熊貓。此外，參與我們特設的電子互動遊戲的朋友們，也可以獲得我們送出的精緻紀念品，其中包括有香港特色的大熊貓盲盒等，希望大家喜歡。

此外，成都和香港同是「體育動感之都」，高水準的體壇盛事今年在兩地也輪流舉行，先有八月國家首次承辦世界運動會，選址在成都這個歷史文化古城舉行，中國香港隊有幸參與並獲得打破過往參與世運會的佳績，而香港則於下月與廣東省和澳門特區攜手合辦第十五屆全國運動會，並且承辦八個項目。展覽為此特設體育展區，作為全運會的預熱宣傳；而十五運會及殘特奧會吉祥物「喜洋洋」和「樂融融」今天亦在場，跟大家喜迎全運。

我們期望透過今次展覽，讓更多成都朋友認識香港、到訪香港。我們會以藝術投影方式，向參觀人士展示香港的方方面面，包括「澎湃創意之都」、「國際金融中心」、「創新及科技樞紐」和「多元和綠色城市」等展區。我們亦會透過裸眼3D和互動遊戲等藝術科技，全方位展示香港的文化旅遊魅力和最新面貌。

此外，為了讓成都民眾更認識香港的文化藝術地標——西九文化區，我們邀請了香港西九文化區管理局在展覽場地同時設置展區，以打卡裝置及扭蛋遊戲等生動方式，展示文化區的特色，大家一定不要錯過。

除了是次展覽外，新聞處一直透過不同的宣傳推廣方式，讓內地同胞更了解香港的最新發展。社交媒體平台就是一個非常重要的渠道。除了在優酷、微博及微信開設「香港品牌」帳號外，我們去年也在小紅書開通了「香港政府新聞處添馬台」專業號，希望透過這個專業號，讓更多內地朋友接觸到香港的資訊，增加互動。為鼓勵到訪展覽的朋友透過我們的帳號分享參觀的體驗，我們在展覽期間亦會舉行「快拍留影」互動遊戲，頭獎和二獎的禮物是由國泰航空慷慨贊助的雙人來回成都至香港機票，而三獎共有十個名額，每人都會獲得一套六隻的大熊貓盲盒，希望大家踴躍參加。

最後，我希望川港兩地能夠繼續善用並連接「天府之國」和「東方之珠」各自的獨特優勢，在不同領域合作共贏。我更期待大家參觀展覽後來香港旅遊、就學、營商或投資。最後，我衷心感謝各位出席今天的開幕式，亦謹祝川港兩地繁榮昌盛，大家身體健康、事事順利。謝謝大家。"

Professor Lo (Co-Chair of the Program Committee of the 2025 Future Science Prize Week, Professor Dennis Lo), Mr Wang (Rotating Chairman of the 2025 Future Science Prize Donor’s Congress, Mr Victor Wang), Professor Warshel (2013 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, Professor Arieh Warshel), Ivan (Commissioner for Innovation and Technology, Mr Ivan Lee), distinguished guests and speakers, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is really my great pleasure to join you all today at the Opening Ceremony of the 2025 Future Science Prize (FSP) Week in Hong Kong.

  This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Future Science Prize - a milestone that not only celebrates a decade of scientific excellence, but also invites us to look boldly toward the horizon. I am very delighted to welcome you all for the third time here in Hong Kong as the host city of this world-class scientific gathering.

  As just introduced by our Professor Dennis Lo, the theme of this year's event ""Shining a Light on the Future of Science,"" could not be more fitting. Science is the torch that illuminates the unknown, the compass that guides us through complexity, and the engine that propels humanity forward. The five-day programmes of the FSP Week will bring together over 100 brilliant minds from around the world to explore the frontiers of knowledge, foster interdisciplinary exchange, and inspire the next generation of thinkers and innovators.

  Scientific progress is a long and winding road, it is a journey demands vision, perseverance, and collaboration. That is why the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government has made innovation and technology (I&T) a cornerstone of our development strategy. Guided by the Hong Kong I&T Development Blueprint promulgated in December 2022, we have rolled out a series of targeted initiatives and invested heavily in infrastructure, talent, R&D (research and development) and industry development to perfect the local I&T ecosystem. And I hope all our initiatives could be beneficial to all of you. Our goal is very clear: to create a fertile ground where innovative ideas can take root, grow, and flourish here in Hong Kong and to help all of you to make your dreams get realised very soon.

  Meanwhile, we are also deepening international I&T collaboration as we firmly believe that science knows no borders. Events like the Future Science Prize Week serve as vital platforms for building bridges between disciplines, cultures, and generations. Leveraging the distinctive advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland and also being closely connected to the world under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong will continue to play its role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" in fostering international I&T collaboration.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the Future Science Prize Week reflects the highest standards of academic excellence and global perspective. In just a short while, the Science Symposium will commence with a very inspiring keynote address by Professor Arieh Warshel, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. This keynote sets the tone for a week filled with intellectual rigour and visionary dialogue. Indeed, beyond the Symposium, the Future Science Prize Week offers a rich tapestry of events designed to engage, enlighten and inspire. Some highlights include the Laureates' Dialogue with the Youth and the Award Ceremony and Concerts. So I hope that you will find it very fruitful and very meaningful and also very eventful for Hong Kong.

  Taking this opportunity, I would like to also express my deepest gratitude to Professor Dennis Lo, Mr Victor Wang, Dr Harry Sham (Co-Chair of the Program Committee of the 2025 Future Science Prize Week) and also the Organising Committee for their tireless efforts in bringing this remarkable event to life. Let us seize this moment - not only to honour the achievements of our laureates, but also to reaffirm our shared belief that science is a force for good. Let us work together to illuminate the path ahead, and may the light empower us to build a better and wiser world - for ourselves and also for generations yet to come.

âLastly, may I wish you all a very rewarding and inspiring Future Science Prize Week 2025. Thank you."

Registered contractor ordered by disciplinary board to have its name removed from register for 24 months,2025-10-24 11:00,2025-10-24 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400214.htm,"  âThe Registered Contractors' Disciplinary Board (the Board) has completed a disciplinary inquiry under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) and decided that a registered general building contractor (RGBC) should be disciplined for having been convicted by a court of an offence relating to building works.

  The Board ordered the RGBC to be removed from the register of general building contractors for 24 months, with effect from the date of the Gazette. Also, the RGBC was ordered to pay a total of $63,200, being the costs incurred by the Board and the Buildings Department (BD) for conducting the inquiry.

  The Board's written decision and order issued on October 6 was published in the Gazette today (October 24). Details are available at the following links:
https://egazette.gld.gov.hk/pdf?type=egn&year=2025&volume=29&gno=43&notice_no=6671&extra=0

  The RGBC submitted a certificate to the BD in August 2020, notifying the commencement of minor works for subdividing a unit in a residential building at Sceneway Road, Lam Tin; and a completion certificate to BD in March 2021 certifying the completion of the minor works. Subsequently, the BD conducted an audit check and revealed that the carrying out of the minor works shown in the plans submitted to the BD would result in contravention of the regulations under the BO.

  The RGBC was later prosecuted, convicted and fined $4,000 at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts in June 2022, pursuant to section 40(2AAAA) of the BO. In view of the conviction of the RGBC, the BD notified the Board for its consideration of disciplinary action against the RGBC under the provisions of section 13(1) of the BO.

  A spokesperson for the BD reiterated that any registered contractor who contravenes the relevant provisions of the BO in carrying out building works, or is convicted by any court of an offence relating to building works, or has been negligent or has misconducted himself in building works, will be subject to enforcement action including criminal prosecution and disciplinary action under the BO."

紀律委員會命令該承建商在刊憲當日起計二十四個月內，從一般建築承建商的名冊中除名，以及須支付紀律委員會及屋宇署合共六萬三千二百元的研訊費用。

該承建商於二○二○年八月向屋宇署呈交證明書，通知將會在藍田匯景道一幢住宅大廈的一個單位展開分間單位小型工程，及於二○二一年三月向屋宇署呈交完工證明書，確認已完成該小型工程。其後，屋宇署進行審查，發現呈交予屋宇署的圖則所顯示的小型工程一旦進行便會導致違反《建築物條例》的相關規例。

該承建商因而被檢控，並於二○二二年六月在觀塘裁判法院被裁定違反《建築物條例》第40（2AAAA）條的規定，被定罪及判罰四千元。鑑於有關定罪，屋宇署遂根據《建築物條例》第13（1）條的規定，通知紀律委員會考慮向該承建商採取紀律行動。

​行政長官在灼見名家周年論壇暨十一周年慶典致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-24 11:00,2025-10-24 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400179.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月二十四日）在灼見名家周年論壇暨十一周年慶典的視像致辭：

文灼非社長（灼見名家傳媒社長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興以視頻形式，參與灼見名家論壇，祝賀這個一年一度、匯智聚力的高質量交流平台十一周年快樂。

古語有云：「集眾思，廣忠益也」。灼見名家多年來籌辦論壇，雲集政商精英、專家學者，剖析國際形勢、洞悉國家機遇、謀劃香港藍圖。大家在此集思廣益，貢獻睿智，共同激活思維，驅動社會向前。

世事如棋局局新。當前，環球格局風雲變幻，地緣政治陰霾密布。香港作為全球最自由經濟體，必須化挑戰為機遇、於變局中開新局。今日論壇以「國際新形勢下香港如何轉型」為題，正當其時，讓我們攜手思考，在施政管治、經濟產業、創科發展等領域，為香港共謀未來，凝聚動能。

習近平主席指出，「一國兩制」具有顯著制度優勢和強大生命力，是保持香港長期繁榮穩定的好制度。香港在「一國兩制」下享有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，正是我們勇於識變求變、突破轉型的最大底氣。

香港擁有國際化、市場化的營商環境，法治傳統源遠流長，稅制簡單、稅率低廉，人才通曉兩文三語，更是全球唯一擁有五間百強大學的城市。我們近年在多項國際排名屢創佳績，處處展現競爭優勢，為經濟轉型提供動力。

我們的金融中心地位，連續兩年穩居世界第三。今年，香港的整體競爭力，上升四位，晉身世界第三；人才競爭力，躍升12位，位列世界第四；安全城市排名，躋身10大至世界第七。這些客觀評級，既充分肯定「一國兩制」的成功實踐，亦反映國際社會對香港未來的信心。

今日的香港，處於由治及興的關鍵節點。改革、轉型，正是邁向經濟更強大的必經之路。我上月公布最新一份《施政報告》，以「深化改革心繫民生發揮優勢同創未來」為主題，提出多項革新措施，包括加快發展北部都會區，促進產業發展革新，融入國家發展大局，鞏固香港國際中心地位。這些突破新局面的策略部署，正是為了推動香港轉型，邁向高質量發展。

香港轉型，有新引擎。北部都會區幅員廣闊，區位優勢獨特，發展潛力巨大，是推動香港經濟發展的新引擎。特區政府定必全力以赴，搶佔先機。我親自領導北部都會區發展委員會，提升決策層次，簡化行政流程，務求突破瓶頸，達致安全、省錢、省時間的建築目標。我們也會訂立專項法例，為北都發展全面提速提效。

香港轉型，有新賽道。面對市場急變、科技飛躍，特區政府致力促進產業結構轉型，既要鞏固金融、法律等傳統優勢產業；更要培育新興創科產業，例如先進製造、生命健康科技、新能源、人工智能與數據科學，帶動經濟多元發展，創造更多優質職位。我們亦會積極招商引資，制訂促進產業和投資的優惠政策包，吸引高增值產業、高潛力企業落戶香港，注入多元活力。

香港轉型，會把握機遇。國家作為全球第二大經濟體，更好融入國家發展大局，是香港發展的最大機遇。香港是國家高水平對外開放的重要窗口，一直擔當「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」角色，發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台功能，深化國際交往合作。

全球貿易秩序重塑，內地企業轉向積極出海，開拓新興市場。我們成立了內地企業出海專班，吸引和服務內地企業經由香港出海，在香港設立財資中心和區域總部，共創商機、共享繁榮。

香港轉型，會鞏固優勢。香港是享譽全球的國際金融、航運、貿易中心，亦是國際航空樞紐和國際法律及爭議解決服務中心，這些亮麗成果，是我們轉型發展的重要資產。

政府會全力發揮香港制度優勢，鞏固國際中心地位，加速發展新增長點，包括建立國際黃金交易市場，建設大宗商品交易生態圈。我們也會建立通達內陸的「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系，拓展貨源和內地廣大的市場；同時加速擴展航空版圖，並加強香港法律服務，深化調解文化。

各位朋友，時局在變，機遇在前。回望過去，香港經歷多次轉型成功；展望前路，轉型使我們更為強大。我深信，只要我們團結一致，改革創新，香港定能續創高峰，譜寫新篇。

同樣需要大家團結一致的，是即將舉行的新一屆立法會換屆選舉。選舉的提名期已在今日正式開始，而十二月七日將是投票日。我希望各位愛國愛港、有心有力的朋友，都積極參與選舉，並鼓勵你身邊的家人朋友一同投入選舉，共創未來。

最後，我祝願今日論壇百花齊放、碩果纍纍，灼見名家竿頭日進，在座各位工作順利。謝謝大家。"

十一月一日起兒童乘私家車須用兒童束縛設備　違例司機可被罰款（附圖）,2025-10-24 10:00,2025-10-24 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102300561.htm,"政府今日（十月二十四日）提醒本地和跨境私家車司機，由十一月一日起，兒童在香港乘坐私家車時須使用兒童束縛設備，如兒童安全座椅，加強乘車安全。違例司機最高可被判罰款2,000元。

由十一月一日起，八歲以下兒童除非身高達1.35米，否則不論坐在私家車前或後座，均須使用兒童束縛設備；八歲或以上兒童或身高至少1.35米者，則須使用兒童束縛設備或佩戴成人安全帶。違例司機可被警方發出230元定額罰款通知書；如案情嚴重則可交由法庭審理，最高罰款2,000元。

在選擇兒童束縛設備時，市民應以產品適用的身高及／或體重範圍為首要考慮，留意產品是否註有顯示符合國家或國際認可標準的標記，並按指引安裝。如有疑問，應向製造或零售商查詢產品標準，以確認符合法例要求。除兒童安全座椅外，亦可選擇便攜式兒童束縛設備，如安全帶調節器、穿戴式安全約束背心、可折疊幼兒增高座位等，但由於其兩側沒有保護墊或椅背，故保護力在側面撞擊中一般不及兒童安全座椅。

政府自二月起加強宣傳及公眾教育。運輸署與警方、教育局、政府新聞處、香港電台、道路安全議會和消費者委員會加強協作，透過網頁、懶人包、短片、傳媒、社交媒體、家長資訊網站、家長電子專遞、各區交通燈控制器宣傳畫貼等介紹法例要求。此外，署方先後藉復活節假期後、暑假兒童用品博覽及開學前，提醒家長早作準備，盡快購置兒童束縛設備。

Child passengers in private cars must use Child Restraining Device from November 1 and offending drivers may be fined (with photo),2025-10-24 10:00,2025-10-24 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102300562.htm,"  The Government today (October 24) reminded local and cross-boundary private car drivers that, starting from November 1, child passengers travelling in private cars in Hong Kong must use a Child Restraining Device (CRD), such as child safety seats, to enhance passenger safety. Offending drivers will be subject to a maximum fine of $2,000.

  From November 1, unless child passengers aged below 8 reach a body height of 1.35 metres, they must use a CRD in private cars irrespective of sitting in the front or rear seats. Passengers aged 8 or above, or with a body height of at least 1.35m must either use a CRD or wear an adult seat belt. The Police may issue a Fixed Penalty Notice of $230 to offending drivers. Serious cases may be referred to the court, which can impose a maximum fine of $2,000.

  When choosing a CRD, members of the public should accord top priority to the height and/or weight range for which the product is suitable. They should also look for any markings indicating compliance with recognised national or international standards and follow the installation guidelines. For enquiries, they should consult the manufacturer or retailer on the product standards to ensure compliance with the requirements specified in the legislation. Apart from child safety seats, portable CRDs such as seat belt adjusters, wearable safety restraint vests and foldable boosters can also be used. Yet, as they do not have protective pads and seat backs on both sides, their protection capabilities in side-impact collisions are generally not as good as those of child safety seats.

  The Government has stepped up publicity and public education since February. The Transport Department (TD) has strengthened collaboration with the Police, the Education Bureau, the Information Services Department, Radio Television Hong Kong, the Road Safety Council and the Consumer Council to introduce the legal requirements through websites, infographics, videos, media, social media, parent information websites, the ""e-Bulletin for Parents"" and publicity posters on traffic signal controllers across various districts. In addition, the TD further reminded parents to purchase CRDs for early preparations as soon as possible after Easter holidays, during the Children Products Expo in the summer vacation and prior to the first school day.

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's designated webpage on CRDs (www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/crd), infographics on the Agent T Facebook page and the relevant article in the Consumer Council's CHOICE Magazine for the legal requirements and selection tips, or call the TD's hotline 2804 2600 for enquiries."
HKSAR Government strongly condemns and rejects the UK six-monthly report on Hong Kong,2025-10-24 01:47,2025-10-24 02:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400022.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) strongly reprimanded and must resolutely refute the untruthful remarks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the HKSAR in the so-called six-monthly report on Hong Kong: January to June 2025 of the United Kingdom (UK) today (October 24).

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""The HKSAR Government strongly condemns and rejects the UK's attempt through a so-called six-monthly report to make misleading and irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong matters, wantonly put politics above the rule of law and attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance by despicable political manoeuvres. The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, and as a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under the principle of 'one country, two systems', comes directly under the jurisdiction of the Central People's Government. The core essence of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is about China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. It did not authorise the UK to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs after its return to the motherland. The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of supervision over Hong Kong after its return to the motherland. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the UK again to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.""

Safeguarding rights and freedoms

The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) also clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc. Indeed, Article 19 of the ICCPR specifically requires that journalists must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities' including protection of national security or public order.""

""In fact, since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO, the media landscape in Hong Kong has remained vibrant. Like all other places in the world, freedom of the press and speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. The media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise government policies without any restriction, as long as this is not in violation of the law. The most crucial point, which is also recognized in the judgments of the courts of the United Kingdom, is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.""

Laws safeguarding national security

The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government strongly opposes the absurd and false contents in the UK's so-called six-monthly report with regard to the laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR. In accordance with international law and international practice based on the Charter of the United Nations, it is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. With at least 14 pieces of laws safeguarding national security in the UK, the UK Government vilified the HKSAR law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial authorities' performance of their duties in accordance with the law as 'undermining the rights and freedoms', and continued to unscrupulously distort the facts to criticize, which just shows its bullying act are utterly ugly and despicable.""

""In 2020, the Central Authorities decisively enacted the HKNSL and the HKSAR Government soon afterwards promulgated it for implementation. The HKNSL has addressed the shortcomings and plugged the loopholes in the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security of the HKSAR. Its effect in stopping violence and curbing disorder was immediate, and has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence. The implementation of HKNSL was a 'watershed moment' in Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order, as stability and safety of the city have been restored by the law. In 2024, the HKSAR fulfilled its constitutional duty by enacting the SNSO, thereby improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. Those remarks by the UK are not only totally distorting and confounding right and wrong, but they also entirely disregard the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and protection of human rights.""

""In fact, the implementation of the HKNSL in the past five years or so has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly resume to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. According to the âEconomic Freedom of the World 2025 Annual Report, Hong Kong has once again been ranked as the world's freest economy. Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres and comes first in the world in terms of funds raised through initial public offerings in the first three quarters of 2025. Hong Kong ranks the 23rd out of 142 countries and jurisdictions globally in 2024 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, and remains high in the overall ranking and continues to be ahead of some European and American countries which often unreasonably criticise the rule of law and human rights situation of Hong Kong. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security.""

""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that 'laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable'. Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation. All cases are handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law. All defendants will receive fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong (including the HKNSL) and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.""

""Appropriate extraterritorial effect for the offences under the HKNSL and the SNSO fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Hong Kong Police are duty-bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security outside Hong Kong. Those absconders hiding outside Hong Kong are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security. Moreover, they continue to collude with external forces to cover for their evil deeds. It is necessary for the Police to take all lawful measures to strongly combat the acts of abscondment, and such actions are fully justified, necessary and legitimate. Quite a number of countries including the UK would also impose measures on wanted criminals to combat the acts of abscondment. It is indeed a demonstration of hypocrisy with double standards by the UK with ulterior motives that, after the HKSAR Government has announced the relevant measures, attack the HKSAR in safeguarding national security dutifully, faithfully and in accordance with the law.""

""We noticed that the so-called report specifically mentioned the case of Lai Chee-ying and other cases on offences endangering national security. The HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that as the legal proceedings involving the concerned cases are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the case in an attempt to interfere with the court to exercise judicial power independently, which might otherwise constitute perverting the course of justice. The UK must stop distorting the truth, blatantly discrediting the judicial system and trials of the HKSAR, in an attempt to glorify criminal behavior and exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR.""

Improved electoral system

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The improved electoral system of the HKSAR puts in place legal safeguards to ensure the full implementation of 'patriots administering Hong Kong'. Keeping political power in the hands of patriots is a political rule commonly adopted around the world. No one in any country or region in the world will ever allow political power to fall into the hands of forces or individuals who do not love, or even sell out or betray, their own country. In Hong Kong, regardless of one's background, whoever meets the requirements and criteria of patriots can participate in elections in accordance with the law and serve the Hong Kong public by entering into the governance structure of the HKSAR after getting successfully elected.""

Safeguarding due administration of justice and rule of law 

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government safeguards independent judicial power and fully supports the Judiciary in exercising its judicial power independently, safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law. Articles 2, 19 and 85 of the Basic Law specifically provide that the HKSAR enjoys independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication, and the courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. Article 92 of the Basic Law also clearly stipulates that judges and other members of the judiciary of the HKSAR shall be chosen on the basis of their judicial and professional qualities. All judges and judicial officers are appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of an independent commission composed of local judges, persons from the legal profession and eminent persons from other sectors. All judges and judicial officers so appointed will continue to abide by the Judicial Oath and administer justice in full accordance with the law, without fear or favour, self-interest or deceit. Establishing the mechanism for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR will not undermine the independent judicial power. Our judicial system continues to be protected by the Basic Law. When adjudicating cases concerning offence endangering national security, as in any other cases, judges remain independent and impartial in performing their judicial duties, free from any interference. The implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven that the courts have handled all the cases involving the HKNSL strictly in accordance with the above principles.""

""The Department of Justice takes charge of criminal prosecutions, free from any interference by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law. All prosecutorial decisions are based on an objective analysis of all admissible evidence and applicable laws. In addition, Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security.""

""The Judiciary exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or background of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.""

Enhancing national education

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""Schools are places for students to learn and grow. It is the obligation of schools to provide a safe and orderly school environment and atmosphere, and to maintain a campus free from political interference or illegal activities, for safeguarding students' well-being. National education has been an important part of the curriculum for primary and secondary schools as well as kindergartens, for deepening our students' understanding of the country's development, the history and culture, the Constitution and the Basic Law, as well as national security, thereby building up cultural confidence to foster a sense of national identity, and cultivating them into an able and virtuous new generation with a sense of responsibility, visions and love for the country and the city. Teachers are also important role models of their students, playing a vital role in passing on knowledge and nurturing students' character. The HKSAR Government has the responsibility to ensure the professional conduct of teachers. Implementation of national education, including national security education, is the legitimate duty of education authorities all over the world. Different places attach great importance to implementing national security education and developing their students' sense of national identity, including knowledge of their respective constitution, their own history, culture, geography, etc.""

""Academic freedom is an important social value treasured in Hong Kong and the cornerstone of our higher education sector. Since the implementation of the National Security Law, academics or post-secondary education institutions in Hong Kong continue to conduct normal exchange activities with their foreign or external counterparts. Meanwhile, post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong have taken a series of measures to incorporate national security education into students' learning in fulfilment of their statutory duty. These institutions enjoy autonomy on curriculum design, and the HKSAR Government encourages the institutions to provide students with diversified learning opportunities on national security education."""
特區政府強烈譴責和反對英國「香港半年報告」,2025-10-24 01:47,2025-10-24 02:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/24/P2025102400020.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十月二十四日）就英國發表所謂「香港半年報告：二○二五年一月至六月」中對香港特區各方面情況的失實言論和污衊抹黑，表示強烈譴責，並必須嚴厲直斥其非。

特區政府發言人說：「特區政府強烈譴責和反對英國通過所謂半年報告就香港事務說長道短，肆意以政治凌駕法治，妄圖以政治卑劣技倆干預香港依法施政。香港特區是中華人民共和國不可分離的部分，是一個在『一國兩制』下享有高度自治權、直轄於中央人民政府的地方行政區域。《中英聯合聲明》的核心要義是中國恢復對香港行使主權，沒有賦予英國干預回歸後香港事務的權利。英國對回歸後的香港無主權、無治權，也無監督權。特區政府再次強烈敦促英國認清事實，遵從國際法和國際關係的基本準則，立即停止干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」

保障權利和自由

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府堅定維護香港市民受到法律保障的權利和自由。自香港回歸祖國以來，人權一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》亦清楚訂明香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港，有關言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威的權利和自由。然而，和世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》亦清楚訂明，在有必要保障國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，可以依法限制部分權利和自由。《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條更清楚指出，新聞從業員必須遵守及執行「特別責任和義務」，包括保障國家安全或公共秩序。」

「事實上，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，本港的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。與世界其他地方一樣，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障，這點在英國法院判例中亦受到認可。」

維護國家安全相關法律

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府強烈反對英國所謂報告中針對香港特區維護國家安全相關法律的無稽和失實內容。根據《聯合國憲章》為基礎的國際法及國際關係，每個國家都會制定維護國家安全法律，這既是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。在維護國家安全方面的法律，英國最少有14部，英國政府卻將香港特區執法、檢控和司法機關依法履行職責抹黑為『損害民主權利和自由』，並繼續肆無忌憚扭曲事實加以抨擊，此舉正好顯示出其一向霸凌的行徑，實在極其醜陋、令人不齒。」

「中央二○二○年果斷制定《香港國安法》，特區政府隨即公布實施，填補了香港特區維護國家安全法律制度和執行機制的短板漏洞，效果立竿見影，止暴制亂，讓香港居民重新享有在黑暴期間被剝奪的權利和自由。《香港國安法》的公布實施成為香港『由亂到治』的分水嶺，『一法安香江』。在二○二四年，香港特區切實履行憲制責任訂立《維護國家安全條例》，完善了特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。英國不但歪曲事實、顛倒是非，亦全然漠視香港特區立法的憲制責任和實際需要，以及維護國家安全相關法律訂立後，對經濟發展和人權保障所帶來的正面效果。」

「事實上，《香港國安法》實施五年多以來，讓廣大香港市民生活和經濟活動迅速回復正常，營商環境得以恢復並不斷提升。根據《世界經濟自由度2025年度報告》，香港繼續獲評為全球最自由經濟體；香港在《2025年世界競爭力年報》的排名躍升兩位至全球第三；香港在全球國際金融中心中位列三甲，並在今年首三季首次公開招股集資額位居全球首位；香港在《2024年法治指數》的排名在全球142個國家和地區中位列23，整體排名維持高位，並繼續領先於一些不時無理批評香港法治和人權狀況的歐美國家。這些國際認可的成就都是建基於《香港國安法》及其他特區相關法律和維護國家安全工作為香港社會帶來的自由、安穩。」

「香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關人士或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與涉事人士或組織的政治立場、背景或職業無關。所有案件均是嚴格根據證據和依照法律處理；所有被告均嚴格按照香港適用法律（包括《香港國安法》），並在《基本法》及《香港人權法案》的保障下接受公平審訊。任何倡議某些人或組織不應就其違法行為承擔其法律後果，等同給予其犯法特權，這完全違反法治精神。」

「《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》下的罪行訂有適當的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區一致。香港警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛藏境外的潛逃者被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，肆意勾結外部勢力包庇其惡行。警方採取一切合法措施，強烈打擊有關潛逃行為，做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。包括英國等不少國家也會就不同的通緝犯施行措施打擊潛逃行為，然而英國在特區政府提出相關措施後，詆毀盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區，實乃典型的虛偽『雙標』。」

「留意到所謂的報告中特別提及到『黎智英案』及其他危害國家安全案件，特區政府已多次強調，由於有關案件所涉及的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不應評論有關案件以圖干預法院獨立進行審判，否則可能構成妨礙司法公正。英國必須立即停止繼續顛倒是非、公然抹黑香港特區的司法制度和審訊，企圖美化犯罪行為及向特區法院施壓。」

經完善的選舉制度

特區政府發言人指出：「經完善的香港特區選舉制度為全面落實『愛國者治港』原則提供法律保障，確保政權掌握在愛國者手中是世界通行的政治原則，任何國家或地區的人民均不會容許政權落入不愛國甚或出賣自己國家的人手中。在香港，任何背景人士，只要符合愛國者的要求和具體標準，都可以依法參加選舉，並在成功獲選後進入香港特區管治架構，為香港市民服務。」

維護司法公正和法治精神

特區政府發言人指出：「特區政府維護獨立的司法權，全力支持司法機構依法獨立行使審判權，維護司法公正和法治精神。《基本法》第二條、第十九條及第八十五條訂明，香港特區享有獨立的司法權和終審權，法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉。《基本法》第九十二條亦明文說明香港特區的法官和其他司法人員，應根據其本人的司法和專業才能選用。所有法官和司法人員須得到由本地法官和法律界人士及其他方面的知名人士組成的獨立委員會推薦，並由行政長官任命。所有獲任命的法官和司法人員會繼續緊守司法誓言，奉公守法，以無懼、無偏、無私、無欺之精神，嚴格根據法律原則，維持司法公義。建立香港特區維護國家安全的機制不會損害獨立司法權，香港特區司法制度亦繼續受《基本法》保障。法官在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，一如其他案件，都是獨立公正地履行司法職責，不受任何干涉。五年來的實踐證明，法院嚴格按照上述原則處理涉及《香港國安法》的案件。」

「律政司按《基本法》第六十三條主管刑事檢控工作，不受任何干涉，所有檢控決定是基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析後作出。再者，《香港國安法》第五條及《維護國家安全條例》第2條亦明確訂明，防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪時，應當堅持法治原則。」

「香港特區司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。法院嚴格按照證據和所有適用法律判案，案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同；而控方有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人犯罪，被告人才可被法庭定罪。」

加強國民教育

特區政府發言人指出：「學校是學生學習和成長的地方，學校有責任提供安全有序的校園環境和氛圍，防止政治干預或違法活動入侵校園，以保障學生福祉。國民教育一直是香港中小學及幼稚園課程重要部分，以加強學生對國情、歷史和文化、《憲法》和《基本法》、以及國家安全的認識，建立文化自信，提升國民身分認同，培育他們成為德才兼備，有承擔、有視野、愛國愛港的新一代。此外，教師是學生的重要楷模，肩負知識傳承、熏陶品德的重要職責，特區政府有責任確保教師的專業操守。實施包括國家安全教育在內的國民教育，是世界各地教育當局正當合理的責任，不同地方對實施國家安全教育及培養學生國民身分，包括對各自的憲法、自身歷史、文化、地理等知識，均十分重視。」

「學術自由是香港一直推崇的重要社會價值，亦是香港高等教育界賴以成功的基石。自《香港國安法》實施以來，本港學者和專上院校繼續與境外和校外合作夥伴進行正常交流活動。同時，本地專上院校已採取一系列措施，將國家安全教育納入學生的學習範圍，以履行其法定責任。各院校在課程設計上享有自主，特區政府鼓勵其就國家安全教育為學生提供多元化的學習機會。」"

CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as four severe paediatric influenza infection cases were recorded within four days,2025-10-23 20:44,2025-10-23 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300886.htm,"ããThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 23) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case, the fourth this week. The CHP urged schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

ããThe case involves a 14-year-old girl with good past health. She has developed a fever, cough and shortness of breath since October 21. She attended Princess Margaret Hospital today and was admitted to its paediatric intensive care unit. She is currently in serious condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with shock. The girl had not received the 2025/26 SIV yet. Her household contacts are currently asymptomatic and no influenza outbreaks have been reported at her school recently.

ããIncluding today's case, 14 severe paediatric influenza cases, including one fatal case, involving children aged 2 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year in September. Among them, 11 had good past health.

ãã""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season, and the influenza activity remains high. The CHP's latest surveillance data showed that the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses during the past week (October 12 to 18) was 11.84 per cent, similar to the 12.02 per cent recorded during the preceding week. It exceeds the peak of 10.54 per cent during the winter influenza season earlier this year. Influenza A (H3) is the predominant circulating strain, accounting for nearly 90 per cent of all detected viruses, followed by influenza A (H1) accounting for nearly 10 per cent. Influenza B accounted for the remainder. The influenza admission rate in public hospitals is 0.78 cases per 10 000 population, similar to the 0.77 cases recorded during the preceding week. There has also been a continual increase in outbreaks of influenza-like illness in schools and Residential Care Homes (RCHs). As of yesterday (October 22), 608 outbreaks had been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September. Among them, 65, 323 and 220 cases occurred in kindergartens/child care centres, primary schools and secondary schools respectively,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

ãã""Based on the current level of influenza activity and trend analysis, the local influenza activity is expected to remain at a relatively high level over the next few weeks. Furthermore, viruses tend to become more active when temperatures drop. The winter influenza season in Hong Kong typically occurs between January and March. The current summer influenza season may overlap with the upcoming winter influenza season, which could lead to more hospitalisations due to influenza infection than in previous years. I urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV, to act promptly, particularly those high-risk groups such as the elderly, children, and adults with underlying illnesses and immunosuppression. Members of the public may also contact their family doctors to arrange for vaccinations,"" he added.

ããMembers of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to the Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

 Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

 In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance commissioned (with photos),2025-10-23 20:17,2025-10-23 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300569.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (October 23) reminds grave sweepers to pay attention to special traffic and transport arrangements that will be implemented during the Chung Yeung Festival. The FEHD also reminds the public that the newly commissioned Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance in Sha Tin has established a ""smoke-free worship"" environment. The burning of joss sticks and paper offerings is strictly prohibited throughout the premises. The public is encouraged to pay tribute with fresh flowers instead of traditional offerings.

  The newly constructed Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance at On Hing Lane, Shek Mun in Sha Tin commenced operations on September 26. With an area of about 24 000 square metres, the facility provides approximately 40 000 niches, a Garden of Remembrance for ash scattering covering about 3 110 square metres in area, and a Garden of Forever Love with 300 spaces for the placement of abortuses under 24 weeks of gestation. The services are now open for public application.

  To ensure effective enforcement of the ""smoke-free worship"" requirement, the FEHD has introduced robots equipped with artificial intelligence to serve as ""Smoke-free Ambassadors"" and ""Service Ambassadors"". ""Smoke-Free Ambassadors"" conduct daily patrols and will immediately alert staff and issue real-time broadcast warning messages to visitors upon detecting smoke or flames. Meanwhile, ""Service Ambassadors"" deliver mobile customer service and broadcasting information to visitors.

  The architectural design of the Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance fully utilises the natural terrain and environmental features of the site. Plants and trees are arranged as natural barriers through landscape design, allowing the facilities to blend harmoniously with the surroundings, creating a tranquil, solemn and people-oriented environment that is both comfortable and convenient for the public.

  The columbarium building adopts sustainable architectural design principles, incorporating natural lighting to minimise the impact on the natural landscape. The design features include a piazza, solar panels, a green rooftop and a rainwater recycling system for irrigation. The facility is also equipped with various energy-efficient installations and renewable energy technologies. Auxiliary facilities such as crutch hooks at service counters, baby care rooms, and barrier-free facilities are provided to cater to the diverse needs of visitors.

  The FEHD has long been committed to promoting green burials and encouraging environmentally friendly handling of cremated ashes. The Shek Mun Garden of Remembrance features ash scattering lawns themed with various flowers and trees to create a natural landscape, complemented by commemorative plaques that offer visitors a serene and peaceful environment to mourn their beloved ones. The site also includes farewell and memorial facilities, such as a ceremonial room adorned with floral installations themed on ""Four Seasons"", allowing families to conduct simple remembrance rituals prior to ash scattering. Additionally, the Serenity Pond, a Chinese-style imitation of a stone-textured water feature located beside the Garden of Remembrance and Garden of Forever Love, is piloting a memorial experience named ""Connect by Folding"". Family members and friends may write blessings for the deceased on flower-shaped paper, fold them, and place them into the water as a symbolic gesture to express remembrance and affection for the deceased.

  For more information about the Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance, please visit the FEHD webpage www.fehd.gov.hk.

  Furthermore, the FEHD officially commissioned a Garden of Remembrance at the Sandy Ridge Cemetery yesterday (October 22), designated for the scattering of ashes from unclaimed bodies. Four pebble-paved trenches allow FEHD staff to scatter unclaimed ashes in a dignified manner. Commemorative plaques inscribed with the corresponding year and memorial facilities are also provided for public tribute and remembrance."

Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance commissioned,2025-10-23 20:17,2025-10-23 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300569.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (October 23) reminds grave sweepers to pay attention to special traffic and transport arrangements that will be implemented during the Chung Yeung Festival. The FEHD also reminds the public that the newly commissioned Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance in Sha Tin has established a ""smoke-free worship"" environment. The burning of joss sticks and paper offerings is strictly prohibited throughout the premises. The public is encouraged to pay tribute with fresh flowers instead of traditional offerings.

  The newly constructed Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance at On Hing Lane, Shek Mun in Sha Tin commenced operations on September 26. With an area of about 24 000 square metres, the facility provides approximately 40 000 niches, a Garden of Remembrance for ash scattering covering about 3 110 square metres in area, and a Garden of Forever Love with 300 spaces for the placement of abortuses under 24 weeks of gestation. The services are now open for public application.

  To ensure effective enforcement of the ""smoke-free worship"" requirement, the FEHD has introduced robots equipped with artificial intelligence to serve as ""Smoke-free Ambassadors"" and ""Service Ambassadors"". ""Smoke-Free Ambassadors"" conduct daily patrols and will immediately alert staff and issue real-time broadcast warning messages to visitors upon detecting smoke or flames. Meanwhile, ""Service Ambassadors"" deliver mobile customer service and broadcasting information to visitors.

  The architectural design of the Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance fully utilises the natural terrain and environmental features of the site. Plants and trees are arranged as natural barriers through landscape design, allowing the facilities to blend harmoniously with the surroundings, creating a tranquil, solemn and people-oriented environment that is both comfortable and convenient for the public.

  The columbarium building adopts sustainable architectural design principles, incorporating natural lighting to minimise the impact on the natural landscape. The design features include a piazza, solar panels, a green rooftop and a rainwater recycling system for irrigation. The facility is also equipped with various energy-efficient installations and renewable energy technologies. Auxiliary facilities such as crutch hooks at service counters, baby care rooms, and barrier-free facilities are provided to cater to the diverse needs of visitors.

  The FEHD has long been committed to promoting green burials and encouraging environmentally friendly handling of cremated ashes. The Shek Mun Garden of Remembrance features ash scattering lawns themed with various flowers and trees to create a natural landscape, complemented by commemorative plaques that offer visitors a serene and peaceful environment to mourn their beloved ones. The site also includes farewell and memorial facilities, such as a ceremonial room adorned with floral installations themed on ""Four Seasons"", allowing families to conduct simple remembrance rituals prior to ash scattering. Additionally, the Serenity Pond, a Chinese-style imitation of a stone-textured water feature located beside the Garden of Remembrance and Garden of Forever Love, is piloting a memorial experience named ""Connect by Folding"". Family members and friends may write blessings for the deceased on flower-shaped paper, fold them, and place them into the water as a symbolic gesture to express remembrance and affection for the deceased.

  For more information about the Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance, please visit the FEHD webpage www.fehd.gov.hk.

  Furthermore, the FEHD officially commissioned a Garden of Remembrance at the Sandy Ridge Cemetery yesterday (October 22), designated for the scattering of ashes from unclaimed bodies. Four pebble-paved trenches allow FEHD staff to scatter unclaimed ashes in a dignified manner. Commemorative plaques inscribed with the corresponding year and memorial facilities are also provided for public tribute and remembrance."
CE warmly congratulates victorious conclusion of Fourth Plenary Session of 20th CPC Central Committee,2025-10-23 20:00,2025-10-23 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300825.htm,"âThe Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC Central Committee) concluded in Beijing today (October 23). The session adopted the Recommendations of the CPC Central Committee for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, extended his warmest congratulations on the victorious conclusion of the session. He said that the session holds great significance, as this year marks the conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan period and the preparatory year for the 15th Five-Year Plan.

The communique of the session stated that the session gave a highly positive assessment of the country's major achievements in development during the 14th Five-Year Plan period and outlined the main goals for economic and social development during the 15th Five-Year Plan period. The session emphasised the need to unite in a concerted endeavour to accomplish the 15th Five-Year Plan; to promote the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao; to promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and the cause of national reunification; and to contribute to the building of a global community of shared future. The session also pointed out that thoroughly studying and implementing the spirit of the session is a major political task for the entire Party and the country, both at present and in the near future.

Mr Lee was deeply inspired and encouraged by the victorious conclusion of the Fourth Plenary Session of 20th CPC Central Committee. He noted that, despite the accelerating global changes unseen in a century during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, the country has solidly strived for high-quality development, achieving groundbreaking progress, transformative changes and historic accomplishments in economic and social development. Furthermore, the country has further deepened reform comprehensively, making impressive achievements that drew global attention. The recommendations for the 15th Five-Year Plan adopted at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee will provide a top-level design and strategic blueprint for the country's development over the next five years and are of great significance and impact to Hong Kong.

""Under the 'one country, two systems' principle, Hong Kong enjoys the unique advantage of having the strong support of the country while being closely connected to the world. During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, Hong Kong has been actively integrating into national development and playing an important role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder' for the world. The 15th Five-Year Plan period is crucial for the nation in building a great country and moving toward national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernisation. It also coincides with a critical period when the implementation of 'one country, two systems' enters a new stage and Hong Kong accelerates its progression from governance to prosperity. In the face of profound and complex changes in the circumstances for development, where strategic opportunities coexist with risks and challenges with increasing uncertainties and unpredictable factors, Hong Kong will identify and focus on its advantageous positioning in the country's development blueprint, proactively align with the chapters on Hong Kong and Macao in the 15th Five-Year Plan, seize the significant opportunities brought about by the country's development, and leverage its own unique advantages in national development. All sectors of the Hong Kong community should earnestly study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, give full play to the strength and value of 'patriots administering Hong Kong' and, in the nation's continuous progress of building a great country and moving toward national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernisation, fulfil Hong Kong's responsibilities, seize Hong Kong's opportunities and make Hong Kong's contributions,"" Mr Lee said."
四日內四宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-10-23 19:57,2025-10-23 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300834.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月二十三日）再接獲一宗嚴重個案，是本周第四宗。中心敦促學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的14歲女童。她在十月二十一日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和氣促，今日到瑪嘉烈醫院求醫，獲安排在兒童深切治療部留醫，目前情況嚴重。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克。女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，她就讀的學校近日亦沒有出現流感爆發的情況。

計及今日的最新一宗個案，由九月開學至今，有14宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎2至17歲，其中11人過往的健康狀況良好。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港現時正處於夏季流感季節，流感活躍程度維持在高水平。中心最新監測數據顯示，過去一周（十月十二至十八日），呼吸道樣本中流感病毒檢測呈陽性的百分比為11.84%，與前一周錄得的12.02%相若，並已超越今年初冬季流感季節最高一周的10.54%。目前主要流行的病毒為甲型（H3）流感，佔整體病毒檢測接近九成，其次為甲型（H1）流感，佔接近一成，餘下則為乙型流感。公立醫院住院病人被診斷為流感的入院率為每一萬人有0.78宗入院個案，與前一周的0.77宗相若。學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發個案持續上升，截至昨日（十月二十二日），自九月開學以來，涉及學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案共有608宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（65宗）、小學（323宗）及中學（220宗）。」

他續說:「按目前流感活躍程度和趨勢分析，流感活躍程度在未來幾星期預計會維持在較高水平。另一方面，氣溫下降，病毒一般會較活躍。香港的冬季流感季節大多在一月至三月期間出現，今次夏季流感季節有可能與下一個冬季流感重疊，導致因感染流感而住院的人數較以往更多。我呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動，特別是高風險群組，例如長者、兒童，及患有慢性疾病和免疫抑制的成年人。市民亦可以聯絡自己家庭醫生安排接種。」

市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

徐樂堅醫生提醒高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-23 19:40,2025-10-23 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300826.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十三日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

個案涉及一名52歲男子，住所位於觀塘區。初步調查顯示，他於十月十七日至二十一日獨自到訪廣東省佛山市。他於十月二十一日出現關節痛，並於十月二十二日和二十三日先後到私家醫院和觀塘家庭醫學綜合中心求醫。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。

他有一名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於他在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得43宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。當中一名患者死亡，其餘患者病況輕微。

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：
• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：
• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-23 19:40,2025-10-23 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300829.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 23), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

 The case involves a 52-year-old male living in Kwun Tong District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Foshan in Guangdong alone between October 17 and 21. He developed joint pain since October 21. He sought medical attention at a private hospital on October 22 and Kwun Tong Family Medicine Integrated Centre on October 23. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition.

 The patient has one household contact, who is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 43 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. Among which, a patient passed away, while conditions of other patients are mild.

  Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water.

Speech by CS at 2025 Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival opening ceremony (English only),2025-10-23 19:24,2025-10-23 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/23/P2025102300820.htm,"Following is the speech by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, at the opening ceremony of the 2025 Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival today (October 23):

Peter (Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Dr Peter Lam), Allan (Representative of the Bordeaux Wine Council, Mr Allan Sichel), ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. A big welcome to the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival, the 13th happy edition!

We have all the ingredients for four fabulous days and nights of wining and dining under the sun and the stars. And this year, ladies and gentlemen, you can party until midnight every night.

I'm told some 150 000 people, from Hong Kong, the Mainland, the Asian region and around the world will take part in this year's Wine & Dine Festival, here to enjoy the stunning, harbour-side setting and the wide range of international and local offerings.

As the Chief Executive announced in his recent Policy Address, this year's Wine & Dine Festival is an enhanced version. More than 300 fine wine and food booths, from 31 countries and regions, are here - waiting for you and your taste buds. It's all part of the Government's efforts to showcase Hong Kong as an international culinary hub. Something we clearly don’t have to tell you.

As Peter noted, this year's Festival welcomes the return of the Grand Wine Pavilion, featuring more than 100 exceptional Old and New World wines chosen by renowned wine critic James Suckling, and offering you a rare opportunity to sample hand-picked wines and enjoy a refined tasting experience.

And, yes, Gourmet Avenue is back and bigger than ever. A dozen of this city’s top restaurants - counting 13 Michelin stars and seven Black Pearl diamonds among them - will serve up Cantonese, Chinese, French, Nordic-Japanese, pizza and more, all in one place.

Then there's the Tasting Room, where five celebrated chefs from around the world come together in a special collaboration.

I know you will enjoy it all, ladies and gentlemen. Every last memorable bite, bottle and moment of this year's Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival.

Once you have enjoyed the food and wine, we invite you to take some time to explore the rest of Hong Kong. Our city truly has it all. You can discover our vibrant arts and cultural scene, explore our rich heritage, relax in our beautiful country parks, have fun at our world-class theme parks, or enjoy fantastic shopping. There is always so much more to see and do.

My thanks to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the Bordeaux Wine Council, and all the many devoted organisers and sponsors who have contributed to the success of this spectacular festival. Together, we are making Hong Kong a true gathering place for food and wine lovers from all over the world.

And while you are enjoying the vibrant life of our city, I would like to take this opportunity to call upon all of you from Hong Kong to cast your votes in the upcoming Legislative Council election to be held on December 7. By casting your vote, you can play a part in shaping the future of this community we all love. Let us elect a team of patriotic, capable, and dedicated legislators who will work tirelessly to serve the people of Hong Kong and contribute to our country.

Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the party, beautiful Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong, the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. That certainly includes fine food and wine enjoyed in the very best of company. Cheers!"
