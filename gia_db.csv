日本進口水產的檢測情況,2026-01-08 15:33,2026-01-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800526.htm,"因應日本政府單方面決定把福島核電站核污水排放大海，食物環境衞生署署長已發出《食物安全命令》，禁止源自日本10（都）縣的水產、海鹽和海藻食品進口本港，受禁（都）縣包括東京、福島、茨城、宮城、千葉、群馬、栃木、新潟、長野和埼玉。

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由一月七日中午截至今日（一月八日）中午，食安中心已對187個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對50個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

由二○二三年八月二十四日起至今日中午，食安中心及漁護署分別檢測了共195 185個日本進口食物樣本（包括125 537個水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽樣本）及共43 118個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。"
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2026-01-08 15:33,2026-01-08 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800527.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on January 7 to noon today (January 8), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 187 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 195 185 samples of food imported from Japan (including 125 537 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 43 118 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."
風雨連場的二○二五年,2026-01-08 15:30,2026-01-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800327.htm,"根據世界氣象組織的初步評估，二○二五年正邁向成為全球有記錄以來第二或第三暖的一年。年內北極及南極的海冰覆蓋範圍持續遠低於平均水平。其中，北極海冰覆蓋範圍的全年最高值是自有衛星記錄以來的最低。二○二五年極端天氣事件影響全球多處，包括東亞、歐洲及地中海東部的熱浪；西南亞及亞馬遜盆地的嚴重乾旱；南亞、尼日利亞西部、剛果民主共和國、南非東開普省及美國德克薩斯州由極端降雨引致的水浸；以及熱帶氣旋在菲律賓、中國、越南、泰國、緬甸、莫桑比克、馬達加斯加、加勒比地區、馬來西亞及印尼帶來的嚴重破壞及重大傷亡。高溫、乾燥及大風天氣亦加劇了肆虐歐洲、韓國及美國加州的山火。

二○二五年一月至十月，赤道太平洋中部及東部海面溫度接近正常，該區海面溫度於二○二五年十一月至十二月徘徊在低於正常及接近正常水平。

本港方面，由於全年12個月均較正常溫暖，包括平均氣溫破紀錄的十月，二○二五年為有記錄以來第六暖的一年，全年平均氣溫達24.3度，較一九九一至二○二○年正常值（註一）高0.8度。而全年平均最高氣溫27.1度及平均最低氣溫22.4度分別為自一八八四年有記錄以來其中一個第五高及其中一個第六高。二○二五年的酷熱天氣（註二）日數及熱夜（註三）數目分別為53天及54天，兩者皆是有記錄以來的第三多。而極端酷熱天氣（註四）日數為四天，是有記錄以來其中一個第五多。

天文台於一月二十七日錄得全年最低氣溫10.6度。全年寒冷天氣（註五）日數為六天，較一九九一至二○二○年正常值少9.2天。此外，這亦是自一九九九年寒冷天氣警告系統開始運作以來，首次年內十一月及十二月均沒有發出寒冷天氣警告。

雖然二○二五年上半年的累積雨量為有記錄以來第五低的444.4毫米，但由於七月至九月出現連場大雨，全年總雨量為2 558.7毫米，較一九九一至二○二○年正常值2 431.2毫米多約百分之五。雨量主要集中在七月至九月，其間雨量佔全年總雨量超過百分之八十。天文台曾發出16次紅色暴雨警告及五次黑色暴雨警告，兩者皆打破各自的全年紀錄。二○二五年的雷暴日數為37天，較一九九一至二○二○年正常值少約5.3天。

由於上半年及十一月的相對濕度遠較正常低，二○二五年平均相對濕度為百分之七十三，較正常值的百分之七十八低百分之五，是自一九四七年以來與一九六三年並列最低。二○二五年濕度較低主要原因是一月至四月及十一月華南的東北季候風較正常乾燥。此外，五月及六月副熱帶高壓脊較正常強，而且向西延伸幅度較大，抑制了本港降雨，導致這兩個月的天氣相對乾燥。

二○二五年共有35個熱帶氣旋影響西北太平洋及南海，較長期（一九六一年至二○二○年）平均的約30個多。全年有14個熱帶氣旋達到颱風或以上強度（註六），接近長期平均的約15個，當中有五個熱帶氣旋達到超強颱風強度（中心附近最高10分鐘持續風速達到每小時185公里或以上）。本港方面，年內有14個熱帶氣旋引致天文台需要發出熱帶氣旋警告信號，為長期年平均約六個的兩倍以上，是自一九四六年以來最多。受七月颱風韋帕及九月超強颱風樺加沙影響，年內天文台需要兩度發出十號颶風信號，平了一九六四年的紀錄。在九月強烈熱帶風暴塔巴影響本港期間，天文台曾發出八號烈風或暴風信號。

年內影響本港的熱帶氣旋數目破紀錄的主要原因是夏季及秋季西北太平洋海面溫度較正常高及副熱帶高壓脊向西延伸幅度較大，有利西北太平洋及南海的熱帶氣旋移向南海北部，提高了影響包括香港在內的華南沿岸的機會。

The year's weather 2025 - a stormy 2025,2026-01-08 15:30,2026-01-08 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800329.htm,"  Globally, 2025 is on track to be the second or third warmest year on record according to the World Meteorological Organization's preliminary assessment. Over the Arctic and Antarctica, sea-ice extent remained well below average during the year. In particular, the Arctic annual maximum sea-ice extent was the lowest in the satellite record. Extreme weather events affected many parts of the world in 2025, including heatwaves in East Asia, Europe, and the eastern Mediterranean; severe droughts in southwest Asia and the Amazon basin; severe flooding triggered by extreme rainfall in South Asia, western Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Eastern Cape of South Africa, and Texas in the United States; and severe damages and heavy casualties inflicted by tropical cyclones in the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Mozambique, Madagascar, the Caribbean, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Rampant wildfires, exacerbated by high temperatures, dry and windy conditions, also wreaked havoc in Europe, the Republic of Korea, and California in the United States.

  Sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific were near normal from January through October 2025, then lingered between below normal and near normal in November and December 2025.

  In Hong Kong, with all 12 months warmer than usual, including the record-breaking monthly mean temperature in October, 2025 was the sixth warmest year on record, with the annual mean temperature reaching 24.3 degrees, 0.8 degrees above the 1991-2020 normal (Note 1). The annual mean maximum temperature of 27.1 degrees and the annual mean minimum temperature of 22.4 degrees were respectively one of the fifth highest and one of the sixth highest since records began in 1884. There were 53 very hot days (Note 2) and 54 hot nights (Note 3) in Hong Kong in 2025, both ranking the third highest on record. There were also four extremely hot days (Note 4), ranking one of the fifth highest on record.

  The lowest temperature recorded at the Observatory in the year was 10.6 degrees on January 27. The number of cold days (Note 5) in the year was six days, 9.2 days less than the 1991-2020 normal. Moreover, this was also the first time that no Cold Weather Warning was in force in November and December in a year since the Cold Weather Warning System commenced operation in 1999.

  While the accumulated rainfall recorded in the first half of the year was only 444.4 millimetres, the fifth lowest on record for the same period, with outbreaks of heavy rain during July to September, the annual total rainfall in 2025 was 2 558.7 millimetres, about 5 per cent above the 1991-2020 normal of 2 431.2 millimetres. The rainfall was concentrated during July to September, and the total rainfall during these three months contributed more than 80 per cent of the annual rainfall. There were 16 Red Rainstorm Warnings and five Black Rainstorm Warnings, breaking the respective highest annual numbers on record. The number of days with thunderstorms reported in Hong Kong was 37 days in 2025, 5.3 days less than the 1991-2020 normal.

  With the relative humidity well below normal in the first half of the year and in November, the annual mean relative humidity of 73 per cent in 2025 was 5 per cent below the normal of 78 per cent and on par with 1963 as one of the lowest on record since 1947. The low humidity in 2025 is mainly attributed to the drier-than-usual northeast monsoon over southern China from January to April and in November. The stronger-than-normal and more westward extending subtropical ridge in May and June, which suppressed the precipitation in Hong Kong, also contributed to the relatively drier weather in these two months.

  A total of 35 tropical cyclones occurred over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea in 2025, more than the long-term (1961-2020) average of about 30. There were 14 tropical cyclones reaching typhoon intensity (Note 6) or above during the year, similar to the long-term average of about 15, and five of them reached super typhoon intensity (with maximum 10-minute wind speed of 185 kilometres/h or above near the centre). In Hong Kong, 14 tropical cyclones necessitated the issuance of tropical cyclone warning signals, more than double the long-term average of about six in a year, the highest annual number since 1946. The Hurricane Signal No. 10 was issued twice in the year during the passages of Typhoon Wipha in July and Super Typhoon Ragasa in September, tying the previous record in 1964. The No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal was issued during the passage of Severe Tropical Storm Tapah in September. 

  The record-breaking number of tropical cyclones affecting Hong Kong in the year is mainly attributed to higher-than-normal sea surface temperature over the western North Pacific and the more westward extending subtropical ridge during the summer and autumn, which favoured the tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea moving towards the northern part of the South China Sea, increasing the chance that they would affect the coast of southern China, including Hong Kong.

New requirements for mandatory fitting and wearing of seat belts and placing of mobile telecommunications devices while driving to be implemented from January 25 (with photos/videos),2026-01-08 13:11,2026-01-08 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800216.htm,"  The Government today (January 8) reminded members of the public that, starting from January 25, all public transport and commercial vehicles' seated passengers must wear seat belts, and all drivers must not place more than two mobile telecommunications devices (MTDs) in front of them during driving, further enhancing road, passenger and driving safety.

  All passenger's seats in public and private buses, rear passenger's seats in private light buses and goods vehicles (GVs), and driver's seats and all passenger's seats of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) must be equipped with seat belts in these vehicles first registered on or after January 25. Drivers and passengers occupying the seats of these vehicles (whether newly registered or not), where seat belts are fitted, are required to wear them. Studies show that wearing seat belts will reduce the risk of death and serious injury of drivers and passengers in head-on collisions by about 40 per cent and 70 per cent respectively.

  Offending vehicle owners, drivers or passengers will be liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to three months. All passengers occupying seats shall be responsible for wearing seat belts. Among them, any driver who still drives with a passenger aged under 15 seated in the rear seat of a GV or the passenger's seat of an SPV without wearing a seat belt will be subject to a maximum fine of $2,000.

  The Government noted that the transport trades are ready for the new requirements. In franchised buses, all seats in newly procured buses have been equipped with seat belts. Together with existing double-deck buses retrofitted with seat belts on the upper-deck seats by operators under government subsidy, to date, around 3500 buses are now equipped with seat belts, representing about 60 per cent of the entire fleet in Hong Kong.

  In addition, from the same day onwards, any driver must not place more than two MTDs (i.e. mobile phones, tablet computers or laptop computers) in front of them during driving. The diagonal length of each screen must not exceed 19 centimetres. The MTDs must not obstruct the driver's view of the road and traffic, as well as any mirror, device or camera-monitor fitted for viewing the roads. Offenders will be liable to a maximum fine of $2,000.

  The Government has stepped up publicity and public education since November 2025. The Transport Department (TD) has strengthened collaboration with the Police, the Education Bureau, the Information Services Department, the Road Safety Council and the transport trades including public transport operators to introduce the legal requirements through websites, videos, media, social media, the ""e-Bulletin for Parents"" and publicity posters on traffic signal controllers across various districts. Franchised bus operators have also strengthened publicity and broadcast inside compartments and at bus stops to alert passengers to the new requirement of wearing seat belts.

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's webpage on the new requirements on seat belts (www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/sb) and placing MTDs during driving (www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/mtd) or the Agent T Facebook page (www.facebook.com/AgentT.hk), or call the hotline 28042600 for details."
一月二十五日起實施強制安裝和佩戴安全帶及駕駛時放置流動電訊裝置新規定（附圖／短片）,2026-01-08 13:11,2026-01-08 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800199.htm,"政府今日（一月八日）提醒市民，由一月二十五日起，所有公共交通工具和商用車座位乘客均須佩戴安全帶；此外，任何司機在駕駛時均不可在前方放置多於兩部流動電訊裝置，進一步加強道路、乘車和駕駛安全。

由一月二十五日起，所有新登記的公共及私家巴士的所有乘客座位，私家小巴和貨車的後排乘客座位，以及特別用途車輛的司機和所有乘客座位，均須安裝安全帶。乘坐這些車輛時，如座位已安裝安全帶，不論車輛是否新登記，司機和座位乘客均須佩戴。研究顯示，佩戴安全帶可減低司機和乘客在迎頭相撞意外中死亡和重傷的風險分別約四成和七成。

違例車主、司機或乘客最高可處罰款5,000元及監禁三個月。所有乘客須為佩戴安全帶自行負責。其中，15歲以下乘客如在貨車後座或特別用途車輛乘客座位未佩戴安全帶但司機仍駕駛車輛，司機最高可處罰款2,000元。

政府欣悉運輸業界已為新規定準備就緒。其中，所有新購專營巴士的座位已配備安全帶，連同營辦商在政府資助下為現役雙層巴士上層座位加裝安全帶，至今約有3500輛巴士配備有安全帶，佔全港巴士約六成。

此外，由同日起，任何司機駕駛時不可在前方放置多於兩部流動電訊裝置，即流動電話、平板或手提電腦，而每部裝置的屏幕對角不可超過19厘米長。裝置不能阻礙司機目視道路及交通情況，以及對觀察路況用的鏡、裝置或攝像顯示器的視線。違例者最高可處罰款2,000元。

政府自去年十一月起加強宣傳及公眾教育。運輸署與警方、教育局、政府新聞處、道路安全議會、運輸業界包括公共運輸服務營辦商等加強協作，透過網頁、短片、傳媒、社交媒體、家長電子專遞、各區交通燈控制器宣傳畫貼等介紹法例要求。專營巴士營辦商亦已在車廂和巴士站加強宣傳和廣播，提醒乘客注意佩戴安全帶的新規定。

市民可參閱運輸署有關安全帶（www.td.gov.hk/tc/road_safety/sb）和駕駛時放置流動電訊裝置（www.td.gov.hk/tc/road_safety/mtd）新規定的網頁、AgentTFacebook專頁（www.facebook.com/AgentT.hk），或致電熱線28042600了解詳情。"

特首夫人（行政長官夫人、香港耀能協會贊助人李林麗嬋）、彭太（香港耀能協會董事會主席彭徐美雲）、各位耀能協會的朋友、各位展能藝術家、各位嘉賓：

早晨！很高興來到香港耀能協會這個以「愛聚‧共融」為主題的慈善藝術展啓動禮。剛踏入二○二六年，首先祝願各位新年進步、健康平安、所願皆成！

今日的展覽展出百多件包括繪畫、陶瓷及手織布藝等藝術作品，每件都承載着展能藝術家的才智與心血，獨一無二，展現了他們的想像力、創造力和克服障礙的堅毅精神。藝術無疆界，它超越傷健，觸動人心，是推動社會多元共融的重要一環。

多年來政府持續投入資源，加強康復服務，以今個財政年度為例，康復服務的預算開支達126億元。但除了資金以外，協助殘疾人士發展所長，讓社會更充分欣賞他們的潛能，也非常重要，這也有助他們更好融入社會。

去年七月，社會福利署便分階段將庇護工場轉型為綜合職業康復服務中心，優化其服務和訓練模式，讓殘疾人士按其興趣、才華及能力接受切合市場需要的技能訓練，預計將惠及約一萬人。我們會持續檢視和優化這些政策和措施，讓服務更貼合殘疾人士和社會的需要。

香港耀能協會植根香港超過60年，自一九六三年成立以來一直致力為不同年齡和殘障的人士提供多元化的康復服務，協助他們發揮潛能和融入社會。我知道協會有84個服務單位和專項計劃，每年服務約29 000個家庭。協會的八間綜合職業康復服務中心，支持殘疾人士通過進階培訓提升技能，並致力透過不同的活動，幫助他們展現才華。

在此，我衷心感謝香港耀能協會的團隊和所有合作夥伴以及義工們的貢獻和努力，同時向每一位參展的展能藝術家致意。我們會和大家一起繼續努力，共同建設一個共融美好的社會！

最後，預祝藝術展圓滿成功，也再次祝願大家愉快健康。多謝大家！"

Three private lots will be temporarily occupied until January 11, 2030, starting from the expiry of a three-month period from the date of affixing the notices (i.e. April 9, 2026). The Government will closely liaise with the relevant land owners and affected parties, and properly handle their compensation matters.

The Government executed the Part 1 Project Agreement of the NOL Project (comprising both the NOL Main Line and the NOL Spur Line) with the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) in July 2025 to commence works on the NOL Main Line that are more ready and time-critical. The Government also required the MTRCL to carry out the detailed planning and design of the NOL Spur Line including relevant statutory procedures in parallel. The NOL Main Line will become the public transportation backbone for multiple new development areas in the Northern Metropolis and connect the existing Tuen Ma Line and East Rail Line, forming a railway loop linking the New Territories and the Kowloon urban area. This will substantially enhance the coverage and resilience of the railway network and also unleash the development potential of the Northern Metropolis.The NOL Spur Line, as a cross-boundary bifurcation of the NOL Project, would connect the metro networks of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, offering both local commuting functions within Hong Kong as well as cross-boundary railway services."
申訴專員公署公布就政府防治山泥傾瀉工作及對政府斜坡管理的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2026-01-08 11:00,2026-01-08 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010700680.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（一月八日）宣布申訴專員公署完成就香港特別行政區政府的防治山泥傾瀉工作及對政府斜坡的管理的主動調查行動，並向土木工程拓展署（土拓署）、地政總署、路政署、水務署及建築署提出合共32項主要改善建議。

公署於二○二四年十一月十四日宣布就政府對斜坡安全的監察及規管進行主動調查行動。考慮到課題的廣泛性及複雜性，並為更有效聚焦課題所涵蓋的不同範疇，公署決定以系列形式，分別進行兩項主動調查行動。公署今日宣布已完成的首項主動調查行動，深入剖析政府的防治山泥傾瀉工作及對政府人造斜坡的管理；而將於稍後公布結果的第二項主動調查行動，則會集中審研當局對斜坡維修責任的鑑辨及對私人人造斜坡的風險管理工作。

陳積志表示：「香港山多平地少，且人口稠密，加上近年出現極端天氣愈趨頻密，嚴重山泥傾瀉的風險確是重大隱患，對市民的日常生活，以至生命財產，都可能構成威脅。」

「土拓署自一九七七年成立土力工程處以來，透過全方位的斜坡安全系統，致力強化斜坡抵禦惡劣天氣的能力。現時本港斜坡的山泥傾瀉風險已較早年大幅降低。這是土拓署過去數十年巨大努力所得的成果，公署對該署的工作予以高度嘉許。公署亦欣悉，現屆政府積極制訂多項前瞻性措施，透過超前準備、加強預警、果斷應急和迅速復原這四大應對策略，持續強化整體應對極端天氣的能力；同時大力應用創新科技，包括開發『智慧斜坡記錄冊』，令防治山泥傾瀉的工作與時並進。」

「全球氣候變化正日漸加劇，本港在斜坡安全方面將要面對新的挑戰及危機，土拓署需繼續抱持推陳出新及精益求精的精神，為斜坡安全監察及規管工作更努力把好關。對於四個負責維修最多政府斜坡的部門（包括地政總署、路政署、水務署及建築署），公署認為這些部門已按其職能及土拓署發出的技術指南，維修及保養轄下政府斜坡；亦有在山泥傾瀉事故發生後，安排緊急視察及維修。雖然如此，公署認為各部門在針對天然山坡及政府人造斜坡的安全管理，以至跨部門協作方面，仍有進一步提升的空間。」

全港約六成土地面積由天然山坡覆蓋，另有大量人造斜坡。截至二○二四年十二月，全港有約61 000個已登記的人造斜坡，政府人造斜坡佔38 600多個，私人人造斜坡則有15 800多個，另有6 300多個混合責任人造斜坡。在調查期間，公署的調查人員審視了大量數據（包括本港自一九八九年起超過35年的山泥傾瀉事故數據、土拓署自二○一○年起開展長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃的相關工程及研究數據等），以及超過50宗涉及天然山坡或政府人造斜坡的山泥傾瀉事故。除詳細審閱文件外，調查人員亦隨同部門人員進行了七次實地視察，深入了解土拓署防治山泥傾瀉及進行斜坡維修審核的工作，以及各斜坡維修部門如何為轄下政府人造斜坡進行維修檢查。

本港近十年（二○一五至二○二四年）每年錄得平均約214宗山泥傾瀉事故，較一九八九至二○一四年的每年平均約300宗，下跌接近三分之一。就天然山坡而言，這類斜坡一般無需定期檢查及維修，土拓署透過長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃，篩選構成較大潛在山泥傾瀉風險的天然山坡，進行風險緩減工程。在二○一五至二○二四年發生的山泥傾瀉事故中，有接近兩成半涉及天然山坡。公署審視自二○○八年起發生的九宗嚴重山泥傾瀉事故，發現多數涉及天然山坡，而且大部分在事故發生前未被納入長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃，或即使已被納入該計劃，但所處的優次較低而在事故前未被納入計劃的顧問合約，以展開實際的工程研究及設計。

至於政府人造斜坡，在二○一五至二○二四年發生的山泥傾瀉事故中，超過四成涉及政府人造斜坡，涉及私人人造斜坡的則約為5%。政府人造斜坡的數量顯著高於私人人造斜坡，因此涉及政府人造斜坡的事故數字較高，屬可以理解。然而，撇除兩類人造斜坡的實際事故數目差異後，公署發現，在二○二○至二○二四年，政府人造斜坡發生山泥傾瀉事故的比率（註1）（按年介乎0.1%至0.6%）仍高於私人人造斜坡（按年介乎0.03%至0.3%），相差介乎一至三倍不等。無可否認，不論政府人造斜坡，還是私人人造斜坡，按年發生山泥傾瀉事故的比率均低於1%，屬甚低水平，而接近八成發生於政府人造斜坡的山泥傾瀉事故，所涉及的均是「人命後果類別」級別（註2）較低的第二和第三級。雖然如此，公署認為對於政府人造斜坡發生事故的比率高於私人人造斜坡的情況，仍是值得當局持續關注。

此外，公署審視了自二○一四年起多宗涉及政府人造斜坡的較嚴重山泥傾瀉事故個案，發現部分斜坡在首次發生事故起計的三年內，便重複發生事故，個別斜坡更曾在五年內，於斜坡的不同部分發生四次事故。雖然該些重複發生山泥傾瀉事故的政府人造斜坡均不屬「人命後果類別」級別最高的第一級，亦不一定每次山泥傾瀉都屬大型事故，但在接連出現事故的情況下，難免會令人對該些斜坡的潛在事故風險，以至結構安全產生疑慮。

陳積志表示：「公署欣悉在調查期間，土拓署主動提出改善措施，包括由二○二五年起的三年內，逐步增加長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃的年度目標，每年進行風險緩減工程的天然山坡會由30個增加至40個；鞏固政府人造斜坡的年度目標，則由150個增加至200個。土拓署亦已識別了三個與筲箕灣耀興道的地質狀況相似的天然山坡，納入計劃進行評估及風險緩減工程。該署亦會重點審視對市民生活有較大潛在影響的人造斜坡，特別是位於唯一行車通道旁的斜坡，有系統地納入計劃進行鞏固工程。」

「綜合上述調查所得，公署認為，土拓署應採取措施進一步提升斜坡的安全管理。同時，各部門應持續深化協作，促進意見交流及經驗分享，令防治山泥傾瀉工作做得更加精準到位。最後，雖然現時的山泥傾瀉風險比數十年前大幅降低，但面對斜坡老化及極端暴雨的威脅，當局絕對不能鬆懈，必須居安思危。防治山泥傾瀉工程對確保斜坡安全十分關鍵，工程進行期間難免會為市民帶來不便，需要市民諒解。我期望市民支持政府的防治山泥傾瀉工作，合力保障公眾安全。」

整體而言，公署就長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃的執行、對天然山坡及政府人造斜坡的安全管理、科技應用，以及跨部門協作，向土拓署、地政總署、路政署、水務署及建築署提出共32項主要改善建議。公署欣悉，上述部門均接納公署提出的所有改善建議。

公署向各個部門提出的主要改善建議包括：


土拓署應積極研究加快為三個已納入長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃、與筲箕灣耀興道的地質狀況相似的天然山坡，開展風險緩減工程的可行性；
土拓署應繼續定期審視現行揀選天然山坡納入長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃的考慮因素有否進一步優化的空間，讓當局能及早識別具潛在風險的天然山坡；
土拓署應繼續關注和審視政府人造斜坡與私人人造斜坡在發生事故的比率是否出現重大差異，並了解箇中原因，以及在有需要時制訂合適的應對措施；
若土拓署審視後發現部門對政府人造斜坡的維修保養工作有進一步提升的地方，則應繼續以技術指引的方式訂明，讓負責維修斜坡的部門有所依循；
土拓署應繼續定期檢視現時就揀選政府人造斜坡納入長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃進行鞏固工程的考慮因素有否優化的空間（例如更有彈性地按實際情況提升重複發生山泥傾瀉事故的斜坡在計劃內的優次）；
土拓署應繼續透過逐步增加的斜坡監測及管理數據，配合人工智能及大數據分析，提升當局對防治山泥傾瀉工程及斜坡維修審核的管理，以及部署山泥傾瀉事故後的應對工作；
土拓署應研究將涉及政府人造斜坡事故的調查及善後工作等納入斜坡維修審核範圍，以期從多角度審視斜坡維修部門的工作有否進一步提升的空間，以汲取經驗，防患於未然；以及
各相關部門（包括地政總署、路政署、水務署及建築署）可一同透過土拓署正在建立的中央斜坡維修資料庫，多利用「智慧斜坡記錄冊」作數據分析，掌握最新的斜坡維修狀況、分享常見的維修保養問題、評估暴雨對斜坡的影響，從而協助部門計劃日常維修檢查和於惡劣天氣後的特別巡查工作，藉以提升效率。

Ombudsman announces results of direct investigation operation into Government's work on landslide prevention and mitigation and management of government slopes (with photos),2026-01-08 11:00,2026-01-08 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010700691.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (January 8) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the work of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on landslide prevention and mitigation as well as management of government slopes, with 32 major recommendations for improvements made to the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), the Lands Department (LandsD), the Highways Department (HyD), the Water Supplies Department (WSD) and the Architectural Services Department (ArchSD).

  On November 14, 2024, the Office of The Ombudsman (the Office) announced the launch of a direct investigation operation into the Government's monitoring and regulation of slope safety. Given the extent and complexity of the topic, the Office decided to initiate two direct investigation operations under a series approach to focus on the different aspects involved more effectively. While the first direct investigation operation announced by the Office today examines in detail the Government's landslide prevention and mitigation work, and its management of government man-made slopes, the second operation to be completed and announced later will focus on the authorities' determination of slope maintenance responsibility and risk management of private man-made slopes.

  Mr Chan said, ""Hong Kong is densely populated and characterised by its hilly terrain and scarcity of land. Coupled with the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events, the risk of severe landslides is indeed a significant hazard, posing potential threats to the public's daily activities, lives and property.

  ""Since the establishment of the Geotechnical Engineering Office in 1977, the CEDD has endeavoured to enhance slope resilience against severe weather through a comprehensive slope safety system. The landslide risk in Hong Kong has been substantially lowered compared with the early years. This is an achievement as a result of the CEDD's immense efforts over the past decades. The Office highly commends the CEDD's work. We are also pleased to note that the current-term Government has introduced multiple forward-looking measures to continuously strengthen the overall capacity in coping with extreme weather through four key strategies, namely advance preparedness, enhanced early warning, decisive emergency response and speedy recovery. Meanwhile, the current-term Government vigorously applies innovative technologies, including the development of a Smart Slope Catalogue, to ensure that landslide prevention and mitigation work keep pace with the times.

  ""As global climate change intensifies, slope safety in Hong Kong will face new challenges and risks. The CEDD should continuously keep up with an innovative spirit and strive for excellence, in order to safeguard the monitoring and regulation of slope safety. As regards the four departments with maintenance responsibility for the majority of government man-made slopes (namely the LandsD, the HyD, the WSD and the ArchSD), we consider these departments to have carried out slope maintenance and repairs in accordance with their respective purview and the technical guide issued by the CEDD, and have arranged emergency inspections and repairs after landslide incidents. Nevertheless, we still find room for improvement on the part of all departments concerned in the safety management of natural hillside catchments and government man-made slopes, as well as interdepartmental collaboration.""

  Around 60 per cent of Hong Kong's land area is covered by natural hillsides. There are also a vast number of man-made slopes. As of December 2024, there were around 61 000 registered man-made slopes across Hong Kong, comprising around 38 600 government man-made slopes, 15 800 private man-made slopes and 6 300 man-made slopes with mixed maintenance responsibility. During the investigation, investigators of the Office examined a large volume of data (including Hong Kong's landslide data from more than 35 years since 1989, and data on relevant works and studies undertaken by the CEDD since 2010 under the Landslip Prevention and Mitigation Programme), as well as more than 50 landslide incidents involving natural hillside catchments or government man-made slopes. In addition to scrutinising documents, investigators also shadowed departmental staff in conducting seven site visits to acquire a comprehensive understanding on the CEDD's work on landslide prevention and mitigation, and slope maintenance audits, as well as how various maintenance departments carry out maintenance inspections to government man-made slopes under their purview.

  Over the past decade (2015 to 2024), an annual average of around 214 landslides was recorded in Hong Kong, nearly one-third below the annual average of around 300 landslides between 1989 and 2014. While natural hillside catchments generally do not require regular inspections or maintenance, the CEDD identifies those with higher potential risks for inclusion in the Programme to carry out risk mitigation works. Between 2015 and 2024, nearly 25 per cent of landslides involved natural hillside catchments. Upon review of nine serious landslides that occurred since 2008, the Office found that most involved natural hillside catchments. A majority of them had not been included in the Programme before the incidents, or even if they had already been so included, they were accorded a relatively low priority such that the actual study and design of the works had yet to commence by a consultancy contract of the programme before the incidents.

  As for government man-made slopes, among the landslides that occurred between 2015 and 2024, more than 40 per cent involved government man-made slopes and around 5 per cent involved private man-made slopes. As there are far more government man-made slopes than private ones, the higher number of incidents involving government man-made slopes is understandable. However, discounting the actual difference in the number of incidents involving the two kinds of slopes, the Office found that the failure rate (Note 1) of government man-made slopes (annual rate from 0.1 to 0.6 per cent) was still higher than that of private man-made slopes (annual rate from 0.03 to 0.3 per cent) by one to three times between 2020 and 2024. Undeniably, the failure rates of both government and private man-made slopes remained at a very low level of less than 1 per cent each year. In addition, the consequence-to-life category (Note 2) of nearly 80 per cent of the government man-made slopes with landslides was either the lower category 2 or 3. Nevertheless, the Office considers that the higher failure rate of government man-made slopes compared to private ones still warrants the Government's continuous attention.

  Furthermore, having reviewed those relatively more serious landslides involving government man-made slopes since 2014, the Office found that some of the slopes recorded repeated landslides within three years since the first incident, and that a particular slope even recorded four landslides at different parts within five years. Although the consequence-to-life category of all these government slopes with repeated landslides was not the highest category 1, and not every incident was large in scale, the recurrence of incidents inevitably raises concerns about the potential risks and structural safety of these slopes.

  Mr Chan said, ""The Office is pleased to learn that during our investigation, the CEDD proactively proposed improvement measures, including increasing the annual targets of the Programme progressively within three years from 2025, with the number of natural hillside catchments for risk mitigation works increased from 30 to 40 and that of government man-made slopes for upgrading works increased from 150 to 200. The CEDD has also identified three natural hillside catchments with similar geological conditions as Yiu Hing Road, Shau Kei Wan and included them in the Programme for assessment and risk mitigation works. In addition, the department will prioritise man-made slopes with greater potential impact on people's livelihood, especially those adjacent to the sole vehicular access, and systematically include them in the Programme for upgrading works.

  ""Summing up our findings, we recommend that the CEDD adopt measures to further enhance slope safety management. Meanwhile, all relevant departments should continue to deepen collaboration, foster exchanges of views and sharing of experiences so that their landslide prevention and mitigation work can be carried out more precisely and effectively. Finally, although the current landslide risk is substantially lower than decades ago, the authorities must remain vigilant in the face of slope degradation and the threat of extreme rainfall, and be well prepared for tough times. Landslide prevention and mitigation works are crucial for slope safety, yet call for the public's understanding for the inconvenience inevitably caused during the works period. I appeal to members of the public to support the Government's landslide prevention and mitigation work and work together to safeguard public safety.""

  Overall, the Office has made 32 recommendations to the CEDD, the LandsD, the HyD, the WSD and the ArchSD regarding the implementation of the Programme, safety management of natural hillside catchments and government man-made slopes, application of technologies and interdepartmental collaboration. The Office is pleased to note that the departments above have accepted all the recommendations.

  The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the departments include:


The CEDD should actively explore the feasibility of expediting risk mitigation works for the three natural hillside catchments already included in the Programme which have similar geological conditions as Yiu Hing Road, Shau Kei Wan;
The CEDD should continue with its regular review on any room to optimise the current selection criteria of natural hillside catchments for inclusion in the Programme, so that those with potential risks can be identified earlier;
The CEDD should continue to take note of any considerable differences in the failure rates between government and private man-made slopes, examine the underlying causes and formulate proper counter-measures where necessary;
If its examination reveals any areas for improvement in the maintenance of government man-made slopes on the part of the maintenance departments, the CEDD should continue to issue technical guidelines for their compliance;
The CEDD should continue with its regular review on any room to optimise the current selection criteria of government man-made slopes for inclusion in the Programme for upgrading works (for example, allowing more flexibility in prioritising slopes with repeated landslides under the programme according to actual circumstances);
The CEDD should continue to enhance the management of landslide prevention and mitigation works and slope maintenance audits as well as the planning of post-landslide response actions through the gradual increase of slope monitoring and management data, coupled with AI and big-data analytics;
The CEDD should explore expanding the scope of slope maintenance audits to include post-incident investigations and response actions involving government man-made slopes, with a view to reviewing the performance of maintenance departments from multiple perspectives and identifying possible areas for improvement, thereby learning from experience and nipping landslide risks in the bud; and
All relevant departments (including the LandsD, the HyD, the WSD and the ArchSD) may make use of the Centralised Slope Maintenance Database being developed by the CEDD and the Smart Slope Catalogue for data analytics to monitor the latest situations of slope maintenance, share common maintenance issues, and assess the impact of heavy rainfall on slopes. This should facilitate their planning of routine maintenance inspections and special inspections after adverse weather events, leading to higher efficiency.


  The full investigation report is available on the website of the Office of The Ombudsman at www.ombudsman.hk for public information.

Note 1: (Number of government or private man-made slopes with landslides/Total number of government or private man-made slopes) × 100 per cent.

Note 2: The consequence-to-life category reflects the potential severity of casualties in the event of slope failure. It is classified into three levels from highest to lowest: category 1, category 2 and category 3."

Latest figures of primary healthcare services provided by Health Bureau to residents affected by Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire,2026-01-08 10:00,2026-01-08 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010700579.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced earlier the medical support provided for residents affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. At present, the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong serve as hubs to co-ordinate various primary healthcare services as needed for the affected residents. The HHB announced today (January 8) the latest figures of these services:

DHC hotlines

  Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1, 2025, (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services provided by private family doctors and Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary, and making referrals to necessary healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. The services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow‑up appointments and medication refill service points, from the Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts. As of January 6, the DHCs hotlines across all 18 districts have received 265 enquiries in total.

Free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners and free denture replacement services

  The HHB introduced a free family doctor service scheme, free CM consultation services, and free denture replacement services on December 4, 15, and 23, 2025, respectively to support the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents until February 28 this year. Case managers of the DHCs will arrange for them to receive up to three free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners respectively based on their individual situations and preferences, covering the provision of medication and related treatments; and at least one free dental consultation and one follow-up appointment (subject to clinical need), covering denture replacement and oral treatment services.

  As of January 6, more than 300 private family doctors have participated in the free family doctor service scheme, covering more than 450 service points that include eight private hospitals. So far, 78 affected residents have been arranged to receive free family doctor consultations. As for the free CM consultation services, more than 360 CM practitioners have participated, covering more than 620 service points, and 30 residents have been arranged to receive the services so far. Regarding free denture replacement services, more than 100 private dentists have participated, covering over 130 service points, and 23 residents have been arranged to receive free denture replacement services so far.

HA's healthcare services

  All individuals injured in the fire and admitted to public hospitals under the HA will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation. A total of 79 patients received treatment at various public hospitals due to the fire. As of January 6, 69 of them had already recovered and were discharged, and the remaining 10 are in stable condition. Healthcare staff will continue to provide appropriate treatment and care to these patients.

  Moreover, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31 this year. The waivers cover in-patient services, family medicine and specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs) services (including psychiatry SOPCs), accident and emergency services, day hospitals, day procedures, community services, and Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres under the HA. As of January 6, the HA has provided necessary healthcare services to around 1 700 affected residents.

Mental health support

  The 18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline immediately deployed additional staff and strengthened training for its call handlers on the day of the fire incident to cope with the emotional distress that the public may experience due to the incident. From the time of the incident to January 6, the hotline has received over 12 800 calls, around 700 of which were related to the fire incident. The WhatsApp service has handled over 600 messages, with about 50 of them concerning the fire incident. The HA's 24-hour Mental Health Direct hotline, manned by psychiatric nurses, offers professional advice and support on mental health issues to callers, including provision of risk assessments and referrals to the HA's mental health services as appropriate. As of January 6, the Mental Health Direct hotline has received 94 calls related to the fire incident, with 34 of them coming from affected citizens.

  The HHB will continue to provide comprehensive primary healthcare support to affected residents. The HHB also designed the relevant service workflow from the residents' perspective, allowing them to receive convenient and effective medical support simply through the DHCs (see Annex 2)."

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-08 06:45,2026-01-08 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800094.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月八日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

Employers and employees should take precautions during cold weather,2026-01-08 06:45,2026-01-08 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800091.htm,"Attention duty announcers, radio and TV stations:

Please broadcast the following special announcement immediately, and repeat it at frequent intervals when the Cold Weather Warning is in force:

  The Labour Department reminds employers that as the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions such as reminding employees who have to work outdoors or in remote areas to wear appropriately warm clothing, and make arrangements for employees to rotate from outdoor to indoor or sheltered work sites as far as possible. Employees should take note of the weather report, wear appropriately warm clothing and be mindful of their health conditions. They should notify their supervisors and seek medical help immediately if feeling unwell, such as having cold limbs and body shivering."
CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-08 06:45,2026-01-08 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800093.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 8) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

 The public may also call Dial-a-Weather (1878 200) or visit thewebsite of the Hong Kong Observatoryfor the latest weather information and forecasts, or itspage on Weather Information for Senior Citizens."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-07 18:00,2026-01-07 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700602.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月七日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​​​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-07 18:00,2026-01-07 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700603.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 7), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​​​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

香港房屋委員會（房委會）轄下財務小組委員會（小組委員會）今日（一月七日）在會議上通過二○二五／二六年度的修訂預算及二○二六／二七年度的建議預算。

根據最新的預算和財政預測，預計房委會將有足夠的財政資源，應付截至二○二九／三○年度的經常開支及資本開支。

小組委員會主席麥萃才博士在會議後表示：「隨着新公營房屋項目數量增加，在二○二六／二七年度後，建築開支將繼續上升。為確保房委會的長期財務可持續性，房委會已盡力開源節流。署方已成立了『項目促成辦公室』，協調各部門加快完成公營房屋建築工程及提升公營房屋項目的成本效益。此外，房委會會在二○二六／二七及二○二七／二八年度，每年削減2%的經常開支。」

麥萃才博士補充：「房委會會繼續探討不同的開源措施，例如公營房屋供應將逐步邁向公共租住房屋／綠表置居計劃與其他資助出售單位六比四的比例。房委會仍需增加來自出售居者有其屋計劃單位的收入來應付上升的建築開支。」

麥萃才博士指出：「基於不同因素的影響，這些財政的預測在未來幾年將無可避免地變動，並將會在下一輪預算更新。房委會會保持警覺，密切監察並檢視收入與開支的情況。」

房委會將於本月十九日舉行的公開會議上審議預算及財政預測，然後呈交行政長官批准。"
HA to consider Budget for 2026/27,2026-01-07 17:35,2026-01-07 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700309.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Housing Authority:

 At a meeting today (January 7), the Finance Committee (FC) of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) endorsed the 2025/26 Revised Budget and the 2026/27 Proposed Budget.

 Under the latest budgets and financial forecasts, it is envisaged that the HA will have the necessary financial resources to meet its recurrent and capital expenditures up to 2029/30.

 The FC Chairman, Dr Billy Mak, said after the meeting, ""The HA's construction expenditure will continue to rise beyond 2026/27 due to the increase in the number of new public housing projects. To ensure its long-term financial sustainability, the HA has made every effort to reduce construction costs in response to rising expenditure as much as possible. A Project Facilitation Office has been established to co-ordinate various departments to facilitate the completion of public housing projects and to enhance cost-effectiveness in public housing construction. In addition, the HA will trim its annual recurrent expenditure by 2 per cent for both 2026/27 and 2027/28.""

 Dr Mak added, ""The HA will continue to explore various revenue-enhanced/cost-saving measures, for example, advancing the public housing supply in the direction towards a 60:40 ratio between public rental housing/the Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme and other subsidised sale flats to increase its income from sale of Home Ownership Scheme flats to cope with the rising construction expenditure.""

 Dr Mak said, ""These financial forecasts will inevitably be changed over the next few years due to various factors. They will be updated in the next round of the budgeting exercise. The HA will no doubt stay vigilant and monitor closely, and review its income and expenditure situations.""

 The HA will hold an open meeting on January 19 to examine the budgets and financial forecasts. The budgets will be submitted to the Chief Executive for approval thereafter."

二○二五年十二月份白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數維持於低水平,2026-01-07 17:00,2026-01-07 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700341.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（一月七日）公布，二○二五年十二月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之零點二，較十一月份的百分之零點九為低，繼續處於最低的一級水平，顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

去年十二月份，全部64個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平，大部分地區更為百分之零。另外，去年十二月份的白紋伊蚊密度指數為一，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁www.fehd.gov.hk。

食環署發言人表示：「食環署與相關政府部門已持續深化在各自管轄範圍的防蚊滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊子滋生地、施放殺幼蟲劑、以霧化處理方式殺滅成蚊，並於適當位置設置捕蚊器等。食環署亦為政府部門提供專業意見和技術支援，協助他們迅速制訂和實施有效的滅蚊措施，同時加強公眾宣傳教育。在各方共同努力和合作下，去年十二月份的指數維持低水平。雖然指數維持於低水平，但蚊子在冬季仍會繁殖和活動，食環署會持續監察各區的蚊患情況，並採取迅速有效的防治措施。」

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署已加強資訊發放，並通過新聞公報及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

為降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險，食環署繼續在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，並在病者的住所及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境以徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

​白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。此外，根據世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。去年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至去年十二月初，全球40個國家／地區共錄得超過50萬宗個案。截至去年十二月二十五日，本港錄得59宗外地傳入的登革熱個案；而去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。鄰近地區登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"
Monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in December 2025 remains at low level,2026-01-07 17:00,2026-01-07 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/07/P2026010700342.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (January 7) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in December 2025 was 0.2 per cent, lower than the 0.9 per cent recorded in November, which remained at the lowest Level 1, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the areas surveyed was not extensive.

In December last year, all 64 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index (AGI) lower than the alert level of 20 per cent, and most of the areas recorded zero per cent. Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in December last year was one, which represented that an average of one Aedes albopictus adult was found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department website at www.fehd.gov.hk.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""The FEHD has continued to intensify mosquito prevention and control work with relevant government departments in areas under their purview, including eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and placing mosquito trapping devices at suitable locations. The FEHD has also provided government departments with professional advice and technical support to assist them in swiftly formulating and implementing effective anti-mosquito measures while strengthening publicity and education at the same time. Under the concerted efforts and collaboration of various parties, the index in December last year remained at a low level. Although the index remains at a low level, the breeding and activity of mosquitoes will not stop in winter. The FEHD will continue to monitor the mosquito infestation in all districts and will conduct prompt and effective mosquito prevention and control work.

The FEHD currently makes regular announcements on gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD has strengthened information dissemination by promptly announcing the latest gravidtrap indexes through press releases and social media.

In addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF), the FEHD has extended the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI falling between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks and, in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together to take mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

To reduce the risk of transmission of CF and dengue fever (DF), the FEHD continues to step up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts and conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within a 250-metre radius of the residence of patients and the places patients had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

​Aedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit DF and CF. DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. Furthermore, according to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks last year, and as of early December last year, over 500 000 cases had been reported in 40 countries/regions worldwide. As of December 25 last year, Hong Kong recorded 59 imported DF cases; among the 82 confirmed CF cases recorded last year, 11 were local cases and the rest were imported. The DF and CF activities in neighbouring areas have remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."
