This exhibition illustrates the facts of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the role of the Communist Party of China as the mainstay during the War of Resistance, the support of Hong Kong in the national campaign, and the significance and contribution of the China theatre and the world's anti-fascist battlefield. Admission is free.

The exhibition features 183 pieces of War of Resistance relics, including 82 pieces from the collection of the National Museum of China being showcased in Hong Kong. Around 60 exhibits are on display for the first time. Among them, eight exhibits are grade one national treasures. Other exhibits include precious relics on loan from local cultural institutions, museums and private collectors, supplemented by the HKMH's collections and other historical photos and footage.

  Addressing the opening ceremony today (August 26), the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, said that each artefact, historical image, photograph, and document in this exhibition serves as a testimony to the history of the War of Resistance, restoring the historical truth of that period. It comprehensively showcases the pivotal role of the Chinese Communist Party during the war and highlights Hong Kong's contributions to the national resistance. It also demonstrates the deep bond between the people of Hong Kong and the nation. Mr Chan said he sincerely invites members of the public, especially young people, to visit this meaningful exhibition, to join hands in commemorating this piece of deeply moving history, cherish the hard-won peace, and work together to create a better future.

  Other officiating guests included the Secretary General of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Wang Songmiao; the Deputy Administrator of the National Cultural Heritage Administration Mr Sun Deli; the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law; the Secretary of the CPC Committee of the National Museum of China, Mr Yang Fan; the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive, Bank of China (Hong Kong), Mr Sun Yu; the Steward of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mrs Ann Kung; the Convenor of the Working Group on Patriotic Education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee and Legislative Council Member, Dr Starry Lee; the Permanent Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Ms Vivian Sum; the Chairman of the History Sub-committee of the Museum Advisory Committee, Professor Joshua Mok; and the Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan.

  The exhibition is divided into seven sections, namely ""Japanese Aggression Against China"", ""National War of Resistance"", ""Strong Support from Overseas Chinese"", ""Hong Kong's Joint Resistance"", ""The Fall of Hong Kong"", ""Substantial International Support"", and ""Great Victory"", to showcase comprehensively the history of the 14-year arduous resistance against aggression during the War of Resistance. Precious grade-one national treasures including an armband of the Southbound Protest Group from Peking University, and ""On Protracted War"" by Mao Zedong, disguised as ""Wenshi Tongyi"" (Comprehensive meaning of literature and historiography) will be exhibited. Other highlight exhibits include an ink painting, ""Nanmin Xing"" (Refugees' walk), by artist Peng Youren; an iron plate with the commemorative inscription by patriot Huang Yanpei ""Tiehua he banban, zhong you zhan shi xue""(The iron is stained with the blood of soldiers), created after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai; a letter of gratitude from representatives of the Eighth Route Army to the Hong Kong Branch of the Bank of China and a watercolour painting ""Song of the Pipa"" by renowned Chinese painter Xu Beihong for fundraising for the War of Resistance, etc.

  The museum also reconstructs the scene of the Marco Polo Bridge signifying the Incident of July 7, 1937, and an internment camp during the fall of Hong Kong in the exhibition. As well, it features a multimedia installation, ""Suffering of Hong Kong"", artworks by renowned Chinese painter Ye Qianyu, which records atrocities committed by the Japanese army during the occupation of Hong Kong and the suffering endured by the people of Hong Kong. Highly noteworthy are over 20 interactive programmes, from which the audience can learn about the major historical figures and events relating to wartime Hong Kong, and hear the historical speeches delivered after the victory of the War of Resistance.

  An interactive zone is set up in the main lobby on the first floor, enabling members of the public, especially students, to have a correct understanding of the history of the War of Resistance through multimedia displays and interactive installations such as a spatial history interactive map.

  To tie in with the exhibition, the HKMH will launch a series of free programmes including public lectures, screenings, workshops, field trips, outreach programmes, exhibition guided tours as well as extended exhibitions and activities in collaboration with public libraries. The museum will also provide downloadable worksheets for schools to assist teachers and students in studying the history of the War of Resistance from a cross-subject perspective.

The exhibition is supported by the National Cultural Heritage Administration, jointly presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the National Museum of China, solely sponsored by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. It is supported by the strategic partner (Hong Kong) of the National Museum of China: Bank of China (Hong Kong), in collaboration with the Chinese Culture Promotion Office, with special thanks to the Hong Kong Chronicles Institute and Bauhinia Culture (Hong Kong) Limited.

Bonsoir.It is a real pleasure to join you all tonight at the magnificent Hong Kong Palace Museum for what is truly a historic occasion — the first-ever world-class fencing exhibition held at this iconic cultural landmark.

Tonight, this extraordinary venue is being reimagined — not only as a home to treasured artefacts and rich heritage, but also as a vibrant stage for athletic excellence. This seamless integration of sports and culture sends a powerful message: that athletic mastery, like a fine work of art, reflects discipline, passion, skillsand beauty.

This evening's fencing showcase also brings back fond memories of the Paris Olympics, where the fencing matches were staged under the grandeur of the Grand Palais. We are reminded of the pride and glory brought to Hong Kong by our elite fencers — Ka Long(Cheung Ka-long), Vivian(Vivian Kong), and many others. Their achievements have inspired a generation of young athletes, and I'm confident that tonight will spark even more dreams and passion for this elegant and powerful sport.

And tonight's celebration goes beyond sport. Just now we enjoyed themusicperformance by a group of students from the DBS(Diocesan Boys' School). This event indeed deepens the bonds between Hong Kong and France, through the universal languages of sport, music and mutual respect, and adds colour to our vibrant ties already in business, art and fashion.

This fencing exhibition match is also part of a broader celebration leading up to the 15th National Games, which will be co-hosted for the first time by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao this November. With just 75 days to go, preparations are well underway. Hong Kong is honoured to host eight elite competition events, one mass participation event, and to take part in the organisation of two cross-boundary competitions.

In December, we will also co-host the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games, reaffirming our commitment to the belief that sports are for everyone.

The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government is working hand in hand with our partners in Guangdong and Macao to deliver a National Games that is simple, safe and wonderful. We want to create an unforgettable experience, not only for the athletes but also for every resident and visitor.

And when I speak of ""visitors"", they include supporters and spectators not just fromourcountry but also from around the world.

November will be a busy season for Hong Kong, with a series of top-notch MICE(meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions)events, including the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, FinTech Week, the Hong Kong Fashion Fest, the Wine and Spirits Fair, the Hong Kong Maritime Week, and many more. We warmly welcome more international visitors to join us not only for these events but also the National Games, to experience the excitement of top-level competitions while enjoying Hong Kong's cuisine, culture, hospitality and all that our city offers.

Indeed, this is a unique opportunity to showcase the energy and dynamism of both Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, in addition to the immense business opportunities available across this fast-growing region.

Ladies and gentlemen, my heartfelt gratitude to Youth We Go, the Consulate-General of France, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, and all partners and supporting organisations for making this exceptional event possible.

To all our elite fencers tonight — we salute your spirit and skills, and wish you an exhilarating performance.

Let's enjoy the thrilling matches ahead. Thank you very much.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-26 20:04,2025-08-26 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600752.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 26), two new imported cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

The first case involves a 10-year-old boy living in Sha Tin District. An initial investigation revealed that he travelled to Foshan, Guangdong Province, on August 16. During his stay, he was bitten by mosquitoes. He returned to Hong Kong on August 20 and developed a fever, a rash and joint pain on August 24. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince of Wales Hospital yesterday (August 25) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. His three household contacts, including a person who travelled to Foshan with the boy, are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Another case involves a 31-year-old female living in Sham Shui Po District. An initial investigation revealed that she travelled to Indonesia from August 8 to 23. During her stay, she was bitten by mosquitoes. She developed a fever on August 23, and when she returned to Hong Kong on the next day (August 24), she developed joint pain. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital yesterday and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. Her four household contacts are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the two patients stayed in Foshan and Indonesia respectively during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected during travels. Both cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigations are ongoing and it has reported the cases to the health authorities of Guangdong Province and Indonesia respectively.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 11 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 336 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (August 17 to 23), a significant decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 1 387 cases (August 3 to 9) and 830 cases (August 10 to 16) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. However, we must remain vigilant and continue to adopt a multipronged approach to prevent local transmissions. As the new school year is about to begin, the CHP yesterday issued a letter to schools again, urging them to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. They should also remind the staff members and students to enact mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that they must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-26 19:40,2025-08-26 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600742.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月二十六日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。

最新個案資料

首宗個案涉及一名居於沙田區的10歲男童。初步調查顯示，他於八月十六日起到廣東省佛山市，期間曾被蚊叮咬。他在八月二十日回港，八月二十四日起出現發燒、皮疹及關節痛。他昨日（八月二十五日）到威爾斯親王醫院急症室求診，獲安排入院，在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。他的三名家居接觸者現時都沒有出現病徵（包括一名與男童一同到佛山市的人士），並正接受醫學監察。

另一宗個案涉及一名居於深水埗區的31歲女子。初步調查顯示，她於八月八日至二十三日到印度尼西亞，期間曾被蚊叮咬。她八月二十三日出現發燒，翌日（八月二十四日）回港，並出現關節痛。她昨日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求診，獲安排入院，在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。她的四名家居接觸者現時都沒有出現病徵，並正接受醫學監察。

由於上述兩名病人於潛伏期分別身處佛山和印度尼西亞，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，均屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案分別通報廣東省和印度尼西亞衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得11宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月十七日至二十三日）廣東省新增336宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別為1 387宗（八月三日至九日）及830宗（八月十日至十六日）明顯減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然如此，我們不能掉以輕心，必須繼續多管齊下，避免出現本地傳播。由於新學年即將開始，中心於昨日再次發信予學校，呼籲他們按照食物環境衞生署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，務必提醒教職員及學生，應時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。」

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

尊敬的王松苗秘書長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室秘書長）、孫德立副局長（國家文物局副局長）、楊帆書記（中國國家博物館黨委書記）、孫煜副董事長（中國銀行（香港）副董事長兼總裁）、龔楊恩慈董事（香港賽馬會董事）、李慧琼組長（「憲法和基本法推廣督導委員會」轄下「愛國主義教育工作小組」組長）、莫家豪教授（博物館諮詢委員會歷史專責委員會主席）、各位蒞臨現場的抗戰老戰士、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我非常高興今天來到香港歷史博物館，參加由康樂及文化事務署與中國國家博物館聯合舉辦，香港賽馬會慈善信託基金獨家贊助的「萬眾一心維護和平——紀念抗戰勝利八十周年展覽」的開幕典禮。

從一九三一年「九一八事變」開始，中華民族以血肉之軀，築起鋼鐵長城，抵禦外敵，展開了長達14年的艱苦抗戰。我們的革命先烈，以堅定的民族意志和愛國精神，頑強抗敵，每一寸山河國土都見證了中華民族的堅毅不屈意志。全國各民族、各階級的團結抗爭，不單只捍衞了家園，更奠定了世界反法西斯戰爭勝利的堅實基礎，最終成就了輝煌的勝利篇章。

今天開幕的紀念抗戰勝利八十周年展覽，展出180多件抗戰文物，當中包括八件來自中國國家博物館珍藏的國家一級文物，極為珍貴。每一件文物、歷史影像、照片和文獻都是抗戰歷史的見證，還原了抗戰時期的歷史真相，全面展現中國共產黨在抗戰期間的中流砥柱角色，以及香港在全民族抗戰的貢獻，展示香港同胞與祖國人民血脈相連的深厚情誼。

這次展覽得以成功舉辦，有賴國家文物局和中國國家博物館的鼎力支持，以及香港賽馬會慈善信託基金的慷慨贊助。在這裏，我代表特區政府，表達我們誠摯的感謝。另外，我也衷心感謝中國銀行（香港）、香港地方志中心和紫荊文化集團的大力協助，讓展覽得以順利舉行。

下星期，我們將迎來莊嚴而意義深遠的中國人民抗日戰爭勝利紀念日。我誠摯邀請廣大市民，特別是青年朋友前來參觀這個別具意義的展覽，讓我們共同緬懷這段可歌可泣的抗戰歷史，珍視來之不易的和平，攜手開創更美好的未來。

除了這個展覽，特區政府也正舉辦形式多樣的紀念和教育活動，包括抗戰遺址考察、研討會、專題講座、電影放映會、書展和圖片展等；我們也正在修繕在全港各區的中共抗戰遺址，讓市民更深刻、更全面地認識抗戰歷史和抗戰勝利的重大意義，提升家國情懷和民族精神。

特區政府推出了抗戰勝利八十周年紀念網站，我希望各位市民到網站了解更多不同活動的詳情，參加更多抗戰勝利相關紀念活動，銘記歷史、緬懷先烈。

要認識國家，除了回顧歷史，也可以透過參與國家重大盛事，體現愛國情懷。第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會將會分別在十一月及十二月在廣東、香港、澳門三地舉行，香港賽區首批涵蓋四項賽事的門票，將於後天八月二十八日開始發售。

香港市民現在已經可以到官方票務網站或微信小程序進行實名註冊開戶登記，並於八月二十八日起購票。我邀請大家在參加不同的抗戰勝利紀念活動之餘，踴躍參與全國運動會，一同入場支持國家及香港的運動員，見證他們努力的成果，也見證國家體育發展的偉大成就。

最後，我祝願展覽圓滿成功，各位身體健康、生活愉快。謝謝大家。"

尊敬的藍岸副社長（《香港商報》常務副社長、執行總編輯）、謝興二級巡視員（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部二級巡視員）、各位立法會議員、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好！今天非常高興出席由香港商報承辦的「2025粵港澳大灣區新質生產力暨高質量發展成果巡展」。今次巡展以「賦能新質生產力 推動高質量發展」為主題，正好契合國家新發展格局和香港新發展方向和動能的戰略部署。「新質生產力」是以科技創新為主導驅動，為生產力培力增能，具有高科技、高效能、高質量的特徵。發展「新質生產力」是國家全面把握新一輪科技革命和產業變革的戰略方向，是高質量發展的核心支撐，對國家的全面持續性發展至關重要。

而粵港澳大灣區建設則是國家主席習近平親自謀劃、親自部署、親自推動的重大國家戰略，是推動區域一體化、引領國家高質量發展的重要引擎。

在中央的全力支持下，香港特區與其他大灣區城市優勢互補，緊密合作，共建灣區高質量發展。而香港擁有「一國兩制」的制度優勢，高度法治化、市場化、國際化的營商環境，更是世界上唯一匯聚中國優勢和國際優勢於一身的世界級城市，最能夠擔當內地和全球市場「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，在灣區發展中發揮着「引進來、走出去」的重要雙向平台作用。

在中央的大力支持和粵港澳三地的共同努力下，灣區建設至今已是成果豐碩，碩果纍纍，正如今天成果展的展示，一批批成功的政策大大促進了灣區的一體化進程和高質量發展，例如在促進跨境人員流動方面，「港車北上」、人才「南下、北上」便利、大灣區青年創新創業和就業等計劃相繼出台，深受各界歡迎；而大灣區律師執業考試、建築及工程相關專業人員的備案制度，以及「港資、港法、港仲裁」等，亦大大便利香港專業服務業開拓大灣區的內地市場。

在推動物流發展方面，香港機場管理局與東莞共同推展「海空貨物聯運」，大大提高了跨境航空貨物中轉的效率；而機管局按市場化規則入股珠海機場，更推動了兩地高端航空產業的合作和發展。

至於金融市場互聯互通方面，「跨境理財通」自推出以來穩步發展，為三地金融機構創造了新機遇，亦有助內地金融市場進一步開放。而深圳市政府和廣東省政府等在香港發行離岸人民幣地方政府債券，更進一步鞏固了香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。

這些都是大灣區致力推動規則銜接和機制對接的典型例子，而實際上灣區融合發展的領域可說是無遠弗屆，合作項目更是不勝枚舉，包括「跨境支付通」、「港澳藥械通」、「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」、「廣東院舍照顧服務計劃」、「灣區標準」、高等院校合作、生態保育合作、應急救援合作等等，這些創新政策都對促進粵港澳大灣區高質量發展和香港企業和人才用好灣區機遇，發揮了關鍵作用。

與此同時，香港近年亦積極培育和發展本地的「新質生產力」，以創新科技為引領，結合政府政策和產業協同，逐步構建具香港特色的高質量發展新格局。特區政府更大力推進河套香港園區的建設，強化科研成果轉化，推動新型工業化，並全方位支援初創企業，成功促進微電子、高端製造、中醫藥科技等多元產業升級，加快形成創科生態圈。這些成果不但大大提升了本地產業的競爭力，更為香港經濟注入澎湃動能，並助力國家「新質生產力」的蓬勃發展。

展望將來，特區政府會繼續以識變、應變、求變的精神，勇於擔當，敢於創新，善於作為，積極推動粵港澳三地高水平互聯互通，並持續深化三地的規則銜接和機制對接，爭取更多惠港利民、促進灣區融合發展的政策突破。同時，我們也會繼續充分發揮我們背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，將一些創新和與世界接軌的先進管理理念和做法引進灣區，進而輻射全國，助力國家進一步深化改革和高水平對外開放，從而達致國家對大灣區「一點兩地」的全新戰略定位要求，為國家的強國建設、民族復興偉業，以及香港的長期繁榮發展作出新的更大貢獻。

最後，我祝願今次巡展圓滿成功，並祝各位嘉賓身體健康、事業順利、家庭幸福。多謝大家！"

八月份第八批涵蓋九個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及四個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，除了深水埗區長沙灣的第一階段誘蚊器指數，其餘都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共八批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共51個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這51個監察區中，有33個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有12區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

至於第八批公布的指數高於10%的深水埗區長沙灣，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。長沙灣誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、學校及公共屋邨，各相關部門及持份者正積極跟進控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

​收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the eight batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering four survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent, except the First Phase Gravidtrap Index for Cheung Sha Wan in Sham Shui Po District.

The FEHD has so far released eight batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August 2005, covering 51 survey areas. Among these 51 survey areas, 33 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained at a low level. Twelve other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Among the eighth batch of indexes released, Cheung Sha Wan in Sham Shui Po District recorded an index over 10 per cent. In accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation that strengthens mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20 per cent or above, the FEHD is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. In particular, the gravidtrap data for Cheung Sha Wan indicated that areas with more mosquito problems included parks, schools and public housing estates. The relevant departments and stakeholders are actively following up on the mosquito control work. The FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap indexes in this area to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:


tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest Gravidtrap Index and the Density Index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#).

Enforcement collaboration between HKMA and SFC - SFC reprimands and fines HSBC HK$4.2 million for disclosure failures in research reports,2025-08-26 16:59,2025-08-26 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600480.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has reprimanded and fined The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) HK$4.2 million for breaching the disclosure requirement when publishing research reports on Hong Kong-listed securities over an eight-year period (Notes 1 to 3).

Following a self-report by HSBC, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the SFC, conducted an investigation. Both regulators found that HSBC had failed to disclose and/or made incorrect disclosures regarding its investment banking relationships with various companies covered in research reports published between 2013 and 2021. These issues, which were caused by deficiencies in HSBC's data recording and mapping across systems, are estimated to have affected disclosures in over 4 200 research reports on Hong Kong-listed securities.

The SFC considers that HSBC has failed to ensure compliance with the disclosure requirement and the accuracy of disclosures in its research reports by acting with due skill and care, as well as implementing effective systems and controls.

In deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC has taken into account all relevant circumstances, including:

there have been no evidence of client losses resulting from the disclosure issues;
HSBC has conducted reviews to identify the root causes and extent of the breaches;
HSBC has taken steps to enhance its systems and controls to prevent future breaches; and
HSBC's co-operation with the HKMA and the SFC in resolving the concerns identified in the investigation.


A copy of the Statement of Disciplinary Action is available on the SFC website.

Note 1: This press release is issued jointly by the SFC and the HKMA.
Note 2: HSBC is registered to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts), Type 4 (advising on securities), Type 5 (advising on futures contracts), Type 6 (advising on corporate finance) and Type 9 (asset management) regulated activities under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.
Note 3: Paragraph 16.5(d) of the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the Securities and Futures Commission provides that a firm that has an investment banking relationship with the issuer or the new listing applicant should disclose that fact in the research report."
金管局與證監會合作執法行動----滙豐因研究報告的披露缺失而遭證監會譴責並罰款420萬港元,2025-08-26 16:59,2025-08-26 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600479.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港上海滙豐銀行有限公司（滙豐）因在過去八年於發表關於香港上市證券的研究報告時違反披露規定，遭證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）譴責並罰款420萬港元（註一至三）。

在滙豐自行作出匯報後，香港金融管理局（金管局）與證監會合作展開調查。兩家監管機構發現，滙豐在二○一三年至二○二一年期間發表的研究報告中，沒有披露及／或錯誤地披露其與多家公司之間的投資銀行業務關係。這些問題源於滙豐在系統之間的數據紀錄和配對存在缺失，估計令超過4 200份關於香港上市證券的研究報告的披露受到影響。

證監會認為，滙豐沒有以適當的技能和小心審慎的態度行事，亦沒有設立有效的系統及監控措施，以確保遵守披露規定及其研究報告中披露內容的準確性。

證監會在決定採取上述紀律處分時，已考慮到所有相關情況，包括：

沒有證據顯示客戶因有關披露問題而蒙受損失；
滙豐已進行審查，以識別有關違規行為的根本原因及範圍；
滙豐已採取措施以改善其系統及監控措施，防止日後發生違規行為；及
滙豐與金管局及證監會合作解決在調查中所識別的關注事項。

  Over the same period of comparison, increases were registered in the values of imports of most principal commodity divisions, in particular ""electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances, and electrical parts thereof"" (by $39.6 billion or +21.9%) and ""telecommunications and sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment"" (by $22.2 billion or +49.8%).

  For the first seven months of 2025 as a whole, increases were registered in the values of total exports of most principal commodity divisions, in particular ""electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances, and electrical parts thereof"" (by $180.6 billion or +14.8%) and ""office machines and automatic data processing machines"" (by $127.4 billion or +44.4%).

  Over the same period of comparison, increases were registered in the values of imports of most principal commodity divisions, in particular ""electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances, and electrical parts thereof"" (by $190.9 billion or +15.7%) and ""office machines and automatic data processing machines"" (by $120.3 billion or +53.1%).

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that merchandise exports performance held up well in July. The value of merchandise exports grew visibly further by 14.3% over a year earlier. Exports to the Mainland and a majority of other Asian markets grew notably further, while those to the United States and the European Union continued to fall.

  Looking ahead, steady economic growth in Asia, in particular the Mainland, as well as Hong Kong's enhanced economic and trade ties with different markets, should continue to provide support to Hong Kong's merchandise trade performance. Yet, the United States' elevated tariff rates and lingering uncertainty surrounding its tariff policy may begin to weigh on international trade flows in the near term. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and stay vigilant.

二零二五年首七個月的商品整體出口貨值較二零二四年同期上升12.7%。同時，商品進口貨值上升13.2%。二零二五年首七個月錄得有形貿易逆差2,186億元，相等於商品進口貨值的7.0%。

經季節性調整的數字顯示，截至二零二五年七月止的三個月與對上三個月比較，商品整體出口貨值大致維持不變。同時，商品進口貨值上升2.2%。

按國家／地區分析

二零二五年七月份與二零二四年同月比較，輸往亞洲的整體出口貨值上升19.3%。此地區內，輸往大部分主要目的地的整體出口貨值錄得升幅，尤其是台灣（升91.9%）、馬來西亞（升80.7%）、新加坡（升42.5%）、越南（升42.1%）、菲律賓（升16.5%）和中國內地（內地）（升16.1%）。

評論

政府發言人表示，七月商品出口表現堅挺。商品出口貨值按年進一步顯著增長14.3%。輸往內地和大部分其他亞洲市場的出口進一步明顯增長，輸往美國和歐盟的出口則繼續下跌。

展望未來，亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，以及香港與不同市場日益緊密的經貿聯繫，應繼續為香港的商品貿易表現提供支持。然而，美國高企的關稅水平及其關稅政策持續的不確定性，或會在短期內開始影響國際貿易流向。政府會繼續密切監察情況，並保持警覺。

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 25 to noon today (August 26), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 202 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 160 649 samples of food imported from Japan (including 105 207 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 36 450 samples of local catch respectively.

僱主因違反《僱員補償條例》被判罰款六萬元,2025-08-26 15:27,2025-08-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600449.htm,"海迅人力資源有限公司因違反《僱員補償條例》的規定，被勞工處檢控。該公司今日（八月二十六日）在粉嶺裁判法院承認控罪，被判罰款合共六萬元。

上述公司僱用的一名送貨工人於二○二三年十一月二十三日工作期間，被一輛剷車撞倒，導致雙腳踝骨折。該公司沒有按照《僱員補償條例》的規定，在僱員暫時喪失工作能力期間，在正常發薪日或不遲於其後七天內向僱員支付按期付款，款額為僱員遭遇意外時每月收入與暫時不能工作期間每月收入差額的五分四。

勞工處發言人表示：「有關裁決向所有僱主發出強烈信息，他們有責任遵從《僱員補償條例》的規定，在法定期限內支付按期付款給因工受傷僱員。」

發言人續說：「勞工處不會容忍上述違法行為，並會嚴厲執法，竭盡所能保障僱員的法定權益。」"
"Employer fined $60,000 for contravening Employees' Compensation Ordinance",2025-08-26 15:27,2025-08-26 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600459.htm,"  Hi-Speed Human Resources Limited was prosecuted by the Labour Department (LD) for violating the requirements under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance (ECO). The company was convicted today (August 26) at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts and fined $60,000.

  A delivery worker employed by the company was hit by a forklift while working on November 23, 2023, causing bilateral ankle fractures. The company failed to pay periodical payments to the injured employee during his period of temporary incapacity on normal paydays or within seven days thereafter as required by the ECO, the amount of which should have been at the rate of four-fifths of the difference between the employee's monthly earnings at the time of the accident and his monthly earnings during the period of temporary incapacity.

  ""The ruling helps disseminate a strong message to all employers that they have to pay periodical payments to employees who sustain injuries at work within the statutory time limit stipulated in the ECO,"" an LD spokesman said.

  ""The LD will not tolerate these offences and will continue to make dedicated efforts in enforcing the law and safeguarding employees' statutory rights,"" the spokesman added."
衞生防護中心公布二○二五年上半年本地愛滋病情況,2025-08-26 14:30,2025-08-26 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600252.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月二十六日）公布，本港在二○二五年上半年接獲180宗感染人類免疫力缺乏病毒（愛滋病病毒）和47宗愛滋病新增個案。鑑於晚發現感染者的比例持續偏高，衞生署鼓勵市民進行愛滋病病毒抗體測試，同時恆常及正確使用安全套，以減低感染愛滋病病毒的風險。

新增的180宗愛滋病病毒感染個案涉及140男40女，年齡介乎20至75歲。調查發現，超過九成半個案透過性接觸受感染，當中超過一半（57%）透過同性或雙性性接觸受感染，其餘的是透過異性性接觸受感染。本港新增愛滋病病毒感染個案連續九年下跌。而和去年同期（185宗）相比，新增個案輕微減少百分之三。自一九八四年有統計以來，本港愛滋病病毒感染呈報個案累計為12 583宗。

新增的愛滋病個案方面，涉及33男14女。自一九八五年有統計以來，本港愛滋病確診呈報個案累計為2 604宗，最常見的愛滋病界定疾病為肺囊蟲肺炎。

中心的公共衞生服務處特別預防計劃顧問醫生黃駿君醫生說：「本港的愛滋病病毒感染率持續維持在0.1%，遠低於全球水平，而新增感染個案數字亦持續下跌，充份反映本港在愛滋病防控工作取得成效。」

「然而，晚發現感染者的比例由去年同期的48%上升至58%，情況值得關注。近年晚發現感染者的比例維持在四至六成。中心深入分析數據後，發現高風險人群（例如男男性接觸者和性工作者等）的晚發現感染者比例約為四至五成，而非高風險人群的晚發現感染者則更高，達至六至七成。中心相信，非高風險人群可能忽略了即使沒有經常進行高風險性行為亦有感染愛滋病病毒的風險，以至未能及時進行檢測和治療。」

晚發現指感染者於確診愛滋病病毒感染時，其CD4淋巴細胞（一種免疫細胞）處於非常低的水平（少於200細胞／微升），或已發病為愛滋病患者，代表感染者未能在感染病毒初期及早發現並開始接受治療。

晚發現不單增加出現機會性感染及患上癌症的風險，更令死亡率較其他愛滋病病毒感染個案高出十倍。此外，由於晚發現感染者體內病毒仍然活躍，亦增加愛滋病病毒在社區傳播的風險。

黃駿君醫生說：「性接觸仍然是最主要的愛滋病病毒傳播途徑，市民應恆常及正確使用安全套，以減低感染愛滋病病毒的風險。此外，進行愛滋病病毒抗體測試亦是防控愛滋病的重要一環。為及早發現感染狀況，曾進行性行為人士應最少進行一次愛滋病病毒檢查，以掌握自身健康狀況，有較高感染風險的人士（例如沒有正確使用安全套、注射毒品等）更應定期進行測試。」

市民可透過以下途徑進行愛滋病病毒抗體測試：


在HIV測試服務網站（www.hivtest.gov.hk）或致電愛滋熱線（2780 2211）預約接受免費、不記名及保密的愛滋病病毒抗體測試；或
於HIV測試服務網站預訂愛滋病病毒自我檢測套裝，有口腔液或血液（指尖採血）檢測套裝兩款可供選擇，然後到自行選擇的提取點領取。全港設有多個檢測套裝提取點。


黃駿君醫生強調，愛滋病病毒感染是一種可以控制的慢性疾病。若確診感染，應盡早接受愛滋病專科治理服務及抗愛滋病病毒藥物治療，以抑制病毒及改善健康狀況。及早接受抗愛滋病病毒藥物治療，可有效避免發病成為愛滋病患者及預防其他併發症，大幅改善其存活率。感染者接受治療後如能持續抑制病毒以達至無法檢測的水平，亦不會透過性接觸傳播愛滋病病毒——即「測不到＝傳不到」。

CHP announces local HIV/AIDS situation for first half of 2025,2025-08-26 14:30,2025-08-26 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600426.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced today (August 26) that a total of 180 new cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and 47 new cases of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the first half of 2025 in Hong Kong. In response to the persistently high proportion of late presentation, the DH encouraged the public to undergo HIV antibody testing and to use condoms regularly and correctly to minimise the risk of HIV infection. 

  The 180 new HIV cases involve 140 men and 40 women aged between 20 and 75. Investigations revealed that over 95 per cent of the cases were infected through sexual contact, of which more than half (57 per cent) were acquired via homosexual or bisexual contact, and the rest were acquired via heterosexual contact. The number of new cases of HIV infection in Hong Kong has declined for the ninth consecutive year. Compared to the same period last year (185 cases), the number of new HIV cases has slightly decreased by 3 per cent. The cumulative total of locally reported HIV infections since 1984 is 12 583.

  The new AIDS cases include 33 men and 14 women. Since 1985, a cumulative total of 2 604 AIDS cases has been reported in Hong Kong. The most common AIDS-defining illness was Pneumocystis pneumonia.

   ""The prevalence of HIV infection among the general public in Hong Kong remained at 0.1 per cent, well below the global average, and the number of new HIV cases recorded also continues to decline, demonstrating the effectiveness of AIDS control and prevention in Hong Kong,"" said the Consultant (Special Preventive Programme) of the Public Health Services Branch of the CHP of the DH, Dr Bonnie Wong.

  ""However, the proportion of late presenters rose from 48 per cent from the same period last year to 58 per cent, which warrants attention. In recent years, the proportion of late presenters has been as high as 40 to 60 per cent. The CHP has conducted in-depth analyses and found that the proportion of late presenters among high-risk populations (such as men who have sex with men and sex workers) was around 40 to 50 per cent, while there was an even higher proportion of late presenters up to 60 to 70 per cent among those who do not belong to high-risk populations. The CHP believed that those who do not belong to high-risk populations may have overlooked they still have the risk of HIV infection even though they do not have frequent high-risk sexual practices, leading to delayed testing and treatment,"" said Dr Wong.

  Late presenters refer to individuals with a very low CD4 cells (one kind of immune cell) count (less than 200 cells/mm3) or those who have already progressed to AIDS at the time of HIV diagnosis. Late presentation indicates that these individuals were not diagnosed and put on treatment in a timely manner at an earlier stage of infection.

  Late presentation can lead to an increased risk of opportunistic infections and malignancies, leading to a tenfold increase in mortality rate when compared with other people infected with HIV. In addition, as a result of an unsuppressed viral load, late presenters contribute to an increased risk of HIV transmission in the community.

  ""Sexual transmission remained the major mode of HIV transmission. Members of the public should use condoms consistently and properly to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV. Moreover, undergoing HIV antibody testing is also essential in AIDS control and prevention. For early detection of infection, people who have had sex should get HIV testing at least once to keep track of their health status, and that people with higher risk of infection (such as those who do not use condoms properly and injecting drug users) should undergo regular screening,"" said Dr Wong.

Members of the public can undergoHIV antibody testing through the following:


reserve a free, anonymous and confidential HIV antibody test by visiting the HIV Testing Service website (www.hivtest.gov.hk) or calling the AIDS Hotline (2780 2211); or
order HIV self-test kits (oral fluid-based or blood-based (finger prick) testing kits) on the HIV Testing Service website, and collect the self-test kits at the pick-up location chosen. There are various pick-up locations in Hong Kong.


Dr Wong stressed that HIV infection is a manageable chronic disease. People with HIV should seek specialist care and receive HIV treatment as soon as possible to achieve viral suppression and health restoration. Early HIV treatment with antiretroviral drugs can effectively prevent the progression to AIDS and other complications, increasing the chance of survival significantly. Moreover, those who achieve an undetectable level of virus in blood while on treatment will not transmit the virus through sex, i.e. Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U).

Speech by FS at AI Global Talents Connect (English only) (with photos/video),2025-08-26 11:55,2025-08-26 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600304.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at AI Global Talents Connect today (August 26):

Clara (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, Ms Clara Chan), Professor Huang (Chairman, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, Professor Huang Tiejun), Dr Wang (President, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, Dr Wang Zhongyuan), distinguished guests and students, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning, and welcome to Hong Kong. It is a pleasure to join you today for the inaugural AI Global Talents Connect, hosted by the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited (HKIC) and the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI). This landmark occasion brings together some of the world's most brilliant minds in artificial intelligence - researchers, innovators, entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

AI is fundamentally reshaping industries, economies and societies, and ultimately, the global economy's competitive landscape. Its impact is both far-reaching and accelerating. Unlike many other technologies, where breakthroughs may take years, advances in AI often unfold within months. And its rapid progress has transformative promise across every sector. At the same time, it presents complex challenges around ethics, governance and responsibility for the society. For example, how can we prevent algorithm bias? How can we address concerns about job displacement? How can we ensure the safe and responsible development of AI, and that the red lines are not crossed? They demand collective wisdom and global co-operation.

Given the geopolitical landscape, technological fragmentation is intensifying. Nevertheless, no single country or region can - or should - dominate technological innovation. More breakthroughs will emerge from open dialogue, knowledge exchange and cross-border collaboration among scientists, innovators, engineers, entrepreneurs and businesses.

In this context, building an open, collaborative and inclusive community for AI is vital. Not only is it the key to advancing science and technology, it is also essential to attracting and retaining global talent, which is the driving force behind every innovation. 

Here in Hong Kong, we are fully committed to that vision. We have prioritised AI as a core industry for future development, a key enabler to upgrading our traditional industries and sectors. And we are leveraging our unique strengths across multiple dimensions.

First, in technology. Hong Kong is home to some of the world's top academic institutions. We take pride that three of our universities rank among the global top 20 in artificial intelligence and data science. These institutions are producing cutting-edge research and nurturing next-generation talent.

We have also been making significant, long-term investments in industry research and development. That includes the Hong Kong Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute, which we aim to establish next year. It will put emphasis on translating research into real-world applications, in areas such as healthcare, finance, logistics, education, and more.

Second, access to capital. As Asia's premier international financial centre, Hong Kong provides tech start-ups and companies at various stages with a full spectrum of funding options, from angel and venture capital to private equity, patient capital and IPOs (initial public offerings). By connecting global capital with promising and mature projects, we will create a dynamic environment where great concepts and ideas can scale and thrive.

Third, data advantage. Under our ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong guarantees the free flow of information and data. At the same time, we will introduce mechanisms for cross-boundary flow of data from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong for research and development purposes, under clear safeguards and robust data-security protocols. This will enable Hong Kong to serve as a unique convergence point of Mainland and international data, and a testing field for different applications. These are valuable assets in the age of AI.

Fourth, and most important, talent. Hong Kong's international and cosmopolitan culture, high quality of living, simple and low tax regime, and world-class education system make it an attractive destination for global talent.

But to ensure an abundant influx of AI talent, we want to raise our visibility and global standing in AI. That's why, in this year's Budget, I proposed the organisation of a young scientist forum on AI. I am delighted to see it come to life today, thanks to the joint efforts of the HKIC and the BAAI.

This forum is underpinned by two fundamental elements: openness and cross-disciplinary collaboration. It welcomes scientists, policymakers, investors and entrepreneurs from across geographies, whether they come from the Mainland, Asia, North America, Europe, or beyond. We believe this platform will catalyse intellectual exchanges, spark new ideas, and foster more partnerships in the AI space.

I’m pleased to note a further milestone: the Qingyuan Club, one of the BAAI's most important interdisciplinary initiatives, is being brought to Hong Kong with the support of the HKIC.

The Beijing Qingyuan Club has gathered many of China's top AI scientists, including leading contributors in large language models and embodied intelligence. The establishment of the Hong Kong Qingyuan Club marks another step forward in our ambition to become a global AI hub.

I very much hope that the Club will contribute to Hong Kong's AI ecosystem in three key areas.

First, pioneering frontier technologies. This, of course, includes engaging in more cutting-edge AI research and applications. This will entail more partnerships with academic institutions, investors, start-ups and tech firms so that we build a more vibrant and robust AI ecosystem together.

Second, contributing to global exchanges on AI. Technologies and applications aside, it would also be important to participate in the global dialogue about the future of AI, in particular its safe and responsible development.

Third, nurturing talent. Leverage your networks to attract, connect and cultivate AI talent, especially young innovators who will shape the future of the industry.

Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to the discussions, collaborations and partnerships that will emerge from today's global gathering. Let us work together to build a future where AI transforms societies for the better, and where Hong Kong plays a pivotal role in that journey.

Thank you very much."

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-26 11:34,2025-08-26 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600279.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 26) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Dr Plipat (Asia Pacific Regional Director of the World Justice Project, Dr Srirak Pilpat), Mr Justice Macrae (Vice President of the Court of Appeal of the High Court, Mr Justice Andrew Macrae), Mr Maurellet, SC (Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, Mr José-Antonio Maurellet), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. I am very pleased and honoured to have the chance of speaking at today's conference co-organised by the World Justice Project (WJP) and the Hong Kong Bar Association, which is the first time the WJP organises such an event in Hong Kong. Before we hear from our eminent speakers, let me try to set the scene.

 The interrelationship between the rule of law and absence of corruption is universally recognised. In the United Nations Declaration of the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law dated September 19, 2012, member states recognised the negative impact of corruption, which obstructs economic growth and development, erodes public confidence, legitimacy and transparency, and hinders the making of fair and effective laws, as well as their administration, enforcement and adjudication; at the same time, they also stressed the importance of the rule of law as an essential element in addressing and preventing corruption.

 Hong Kong is perhaps one of the best places to hold a conference on this important topic. Ever since 2015, Hong Kong has always been ranked within the top 10 in the factor component of ""Absence of Corruption"" under the WJP Rule of Law Index. This factor component takes into account three forms of corruption, namely bribery, improper influence by public or private interests, and the misappropriation of public funds or other resources. These three forms of corruption are examined with respect to government officers in the executive branch, the judiciary, the military, the police, and the legislature.

 Corruption was widespread and a major social problem in Hong Kong in the 1960s and early 1970s. However, in a few decades' time, Hong Kong has become one of the least corrupt places in the world. In my view, Hong Kong's successful transformation in such a short time can be attributed to three main factors: first, our comprehensive legal framework; second, strong and independent law enforcement agencies and judiciary; and third, a deep anti-corruption culture in society.

Comprehensive legal framework

 First, as to our anti-corruption law, even though bribery has always been a common law offence and the first Hong Kong anti-corruption statute was made back in 1898 namely, the Misdemeanors Punishment Ordinance, the most important development was undoubtedly the enactment of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) in 1971. POBO introduced novel offences and wide powers of investigations. For example, s.10 of POBO creates the offence of ""possession of unexplained property"", which imposes upon a public office holder the burden of giving a satisfactory explanation if he maintains a standard of living above that which is commensurate with his present or past emoluments, or if he is in control of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his past or present emoluments.

 In addition to POBO, which is general in nature, there are other more specific anti-corruption statutes, such as the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance, which prohibits corrupt conduct and illegal conduct at elections.

 Apart from statutory offences, the common law offence of misconduct in public office (MIPO) is a powerful anti-corruption legal tool. In the judgment of our Court of Final Appeal (CFA) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) v Hui Rafael Junior (2017) 20 HKCFAR 264, the CFA held that this common law offence may include solicitation or acceptance of a bride. The following acts and omissions have been held to constitute the offence: failing to disclose a relationship with a company and showing preferential treatment to that company by permitting it to tender for government contracts despite lacking the requisite experience; accepting free sexual favours provided by prostitutes controlled by the owner of a nightclub; obtaining and using the personal particular of patients of a public hospital to advertise the commencement of a private medical practice. The essence of the offence is the abuse of public trust by the officer. Hence, in that case, the CFA upheld the conviction against the defendant who, in anticipation of his appointment to a senior public office, received large sums of money from others as a ""general sweetener"" for favourable inclination while in office.

 Criminal offences, whether under the common law or statutes, are supplemented by causes of action under our civil law, in particular, the law of constructive trusts, which may be used to compel corrupt public officials to disgorge illegal benefits derived from corruption. The common law principle was laid down by the Privy Council in its landmark opinion in AG for Hong Kong v Reid [1994] 1 AC 324, where it was held that bribe money received by a high-ranking government official, and the overseas property acquired thereafter by him and his wife with the bribe money, were held on constructive trust for the Hong Kong Government, and had to be given over to the Government on the ground that an employer obtains a proprietary interest in a bribe received by his employee.

 In addition to the general duty to obey the relevant laws, public officers are obliged to comply with relevant codes of conduct in this respect which form part and parcel of their employment contracts. For example, the Civil Service Code requires all civil servants to stay vigilant against corrupt practices, observe the highest standards of conduct and guard against possible breach of POBO and MIPO; they should ensure that no actual, perceived or potential conflict of interest will arise between their official duties and private interests; they should not use their official position to further personal interests or the private interest of others; they should not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any advantage of a gift which would influence, or might reasonably be seen to influence, the discharge of their duties and responsibilities. The Code for Officials under the Political Appointment System contains similar provisions; and because they will have access to highly sensitive information, they are also required to declare their investments and interests and such declarations will be made available for public inspection.

 Importantly, while the WJP places emphasis on absence of corruption in the public sector, the laws of Hong Kong are equally strict insofar as corruption in the private sector is concerned. Section 9 of POBO makes it an offence for a person to offer an agent, or for an agent to solicit or accept, an advantage in return for him doing an act in relation to his principal's affairs or business. ""Agent"" includes any person employed by or acting for another. The Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Fung Hok Cheung [2008] 5 HKLRD 846 rejected the argument that a principal/agent relationship will only arise when a fiduciary relationship exists between those two persons; and held that the word ""agent"" should be given its natural and ordinary meaning not restricted by the principles of agency developed in the common law of contract. The civil remedies based on constructive trust that I have mentioned a moment ago are equally applicable to agents receiving brides in the private sector.

Strong and independent law enforcement agencies and judiciary

 Let me turn to the second key factor. No matter how comprehensive the laws are, they can only achieve their intended purposes if they can be, and are in fact, enforced effectively. While many law enforcement agencies are involved, the turning point insofar as the Hong Kong experience is concerned must be the establishment of the IndependentCommission Against Corruption in 1974. Apart from being given very wide investigation and related powers, the most crucial feature is its independence. S.5(2) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Ordinance provides expressly that ""The Commissioner shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person other than the Chief Executive.""

 Having regard to the fact that Hong Kong is an international financial centre, it is worth mentioning that the Securities and Futures Commission, an independent statutory body set up pursuant to the Securities and Futures Commission Ordinance responsible for the regulation of Hong Kong's securities and futures markets, has a strong focus on tackling corruption, particularly related to market manipulation and other financial misconduct.

 The significant contributions made by our strong and independent judiciary must, of course, not be overlooked. The judgments that I have referred to are good examples where our courts developed important jurisprudence in relevant areas of the law, and ensured that they would be fairly and properly applied.

Deep anti-corruption culture

 The third key factor, namely, a deep anti-corruption culture in society is, in my view, probably the most critical one. Many fellow citizens belonging to the older generations of Hong Kong were once victims of corruption: for example, in the old days, even hospital amahs would ask for ""tips"" before giving patients a glass of water. Most naturally, they would share their painful experiences with the younger generations. Today, as a result of the tremendous efforts made by the Hong Kong people collectively, Hong Kong has become one of the least corrupt places in the world. Hong Kong's global competitiveness has risen back to the third place in the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking 2025; and most importantly for the present purpose, Hong Kong's ranking of ""Bribery and corruption do not exist"" as one of the criteria under the competitiveness factor ""Government Efficiency"" is the fourth in the world, and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. Hong Kong people, of course, cherish and are proud of these achievements. We have zero-tolerance to corruption; and are very proactive in reporting and assisting in the investigation of suspected corruption cases. I would venture to suggest that anti-corruption has already become an integral part of the ""genetic makeup"" of Hong Kong people.

The future

 While there is no room for complacency, I have full confidence that HongKong's fight against corruption will go from strength to strength in future. Putting aside the fact that the anti-corruption culture is already ingrained in our society, another very important reason is that the comprehensive legal framework as well as our strong and independent institutions are well preserved by the Basic Law pursuant to the fundamental and long-lasting principle of ""one country, two systems"". For example, the Basic Law provides constitutional guarantees that the common law system shall continue; the judiciary shall have independent judicial power including that of final adjudication; and the Commission against Corruption shall function independently and be accountable to the Chief Executive.

International co-operation

 Lastly, let me turn to international co-operation, it is essential in the fight against corruption. The United Nations (UN) Convention Against Corruption is applicable to Hong Kong; and Hong Kong is an active member of relevant international organisations such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In the past decade, the Department of Justice has processed over 2 800 mutual legal assistance requests and more than 40 surrender cases that concern offences covered by the UN Convention.

 Another important aspect of international co-operation is capacity building and experience sharing. International independent non-government organisations such as the WPJ clearly play an important role in this respect. Today's conference serves as a prime example and an excellent starting point in our collaboration with WJP in this respect, and I therefore look forward to more collaborations between the WJP and Hong Kong in future. On this note, I wish you all a very constructive and enjoyable conference. Thank you."

For example, s.10 of POBO creates the offence of ""possession of unexplained property"", which imposes upon a public office holder the burden of giving a satisfactory explanation if he maintains a standard of living above that which is commensurate with his present or past emoluments, or if he is in control of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his past or present emoluments.

 In addition to POBO, which is general in nature, there are other more specific anti-corruption statutes, such as the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance, which prohibits corrupt conduct and illegal conduct at elections.

 Apart from statutory offences, the common law offence of misconduct in public office (MIPO) is a powerful anti-corruption legal tool. In the judgment of our Court of Final Appeal (CFA) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) v Hui Rafael Junior (2017) 20 HKCFAR 264, the CFA held that this common law offence may include solicitation or acceptance of a bride. The following acts and omissions have been held to constitute the offence: failing to disclose a relationship with a company and showing preferential treatment to that company by permitting it to tender for government contracts despite lacking the requisite experience; accepting free sexual favours provided by prostitutes controlled by the owner of a nightclub; obtaining and using the personal particular of patients of a public hospital to advertise the commencement of a private medical practice. The essence of the offence is the abuse of public trust by the officer. Hence, in that case, the CFA upheld the conviction against the defendant who, in anticipation of his appointment to a senior public office, received large sums of money from others as a ""general sweetener"" for favourable inclination while in office.

 Criminal offences, whether under the common law or statutes, are supplemented by causes of action under our civil law, in particular, the law of constructive trusts, which may be used to compel corrupt public officials to disgorge illegal benefits derived from corruption. The common law principle was laid down by the Privy Council in its landmark opinion in AG for Hong Kong v Reid [1994] 1 AC 324, where it was held that bribe money received by a high-ranking government official, and the overseas property acquired thereafter by him and his wife with the bribe money, were held on constructive trust for the Hong Kong Government, and had to be given over to the Government on the ground that an employer obtains a proprietary interest in a bribe received by his employee.

 In addition to the general duty to obey the relevant laws, public officers are obliged to comply with relevant codes of conduct in this respect which form part and parcel of their employment contracts. For example, the Civil Service Code requires all civil servants to stay vigilant against corrupt practices, observe the highest standards of conduct and guard against possible breach of POBO and MIPO; they should ensure that no actual, perceived or potential conflict of interest will arise between their official duties and private interests; they should not use their official position to further personal interests or the private interest of others; they should not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any advantage of a gift which would influence, or might reasonably be seen to influence, the discharge of their duties and responsibilities. The Code for Officials under the Political Appointment System contains similar provisions; and because they will have access to highly sensitive information, they are also required to declare their investments and interests and such declarations will be made available for public inspection.

 Importantly, while the WJP places emphasis on absence of corruption in the public sector, the laws of Hong Kong are equally strict insofar as corruption in the private sector is concerned. Section 9 of POBO makes it an offence for a person to offer an agent, or for an agent to solicit or accept, an advantage in return for him doing an act in relation to his principal's affairs or business. ""Agent"" includes any person employed by or acting for another. The Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Fung Hok Cheung [2008] 5 HKLRD 846 rejected the argument that a principal/agent relationship will only arise when a fiduciary relationship exists between those two persons; and held that the word ""agent"" should be given its natural and ordinary meaning not restricted by the principles of agency developed in the common law of contract. The civil remedies based on constructive trust that I have mentioned a moment ago are equally applicable to agents receiving brides in the private sector.

Strong and independent law enforcement agencies and judiciary

 Let me turn to the second key factor. No matter how comprehensive the laws are, they can only achieve their intended purposes if they can be, and are in fact, enforced effectively. While many law enforcement agencies are involved, the turning point insofar as the Hong Kong experience is concerned must be the establishment of the IndependentCommission Against Corruption in 1974. Apart from being given very wide investigation and related powers, the most crucial feature is its independence. S.5(2) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Ordinance provides expressly that ""The Commissioner shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person other than the Chief Executive.""

 Having regard to the fact that Hong Kong is an international financial centre, it is worth mentioning that the Securities and Futures Commission, an independent statutory body set up pursuant to the Securities and Futures Commission Ordinance responsible for the regulation of Hong Kong's securities and futures markets, has a strong focus on tackling corruption, particularly related to market manipulation and other financial misconduct.

 The significant contributions made by our strong and independent judiciary must, of course, not be overlooked. The judgments that I have referred to are good examples where our courts developed important jurisprudence in relevant areas of the law, and ensured that they would be fairly and properly applied.

Deep anti-corruption culture

 The third key factor, namely, a deep anti-corruption culture in society is, in my view, probably the most critical one. Many fellow citizens belonging to the older generations of Hong Kong were once victims of corruption: for example, in the old days, even hospital amahs would ask for ""tips"" before giving patients a glass of water. Most naturally, they would share their painful experiences with the younger generations. Today, as a result of the tremendous efforts made by the Hong Kong people collectively, Hong Kong has become one of the least corrupt places in the world. Hong Kong's global competitiveness has risen back to the third place in the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking 2025; and most importantly for the present purpose, Hong Kong's ranking of ""Bribery and corruption do not exist"" as one of the criteria under the competitiveness factor ""Government Efficiency"" is the fourth in the world, and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. Hong Kong people, of course, cherish and are proud of these achievements. We have zero-tolerance to corruption; and are very proactive in reporting and assisting in the investigation of suspected corruption cases. I would venture to suggest that anti-corruption has already become an integral part of the ""genetic makeup"" of Hong Kong people.

The future

 While there is no room for complacency, I have full confidence that HongKong's fight against corruption will go from strength to strength in future. Putting aside the fact that the anti-corruption culture is already ingrained in our society, another very important reason is that the comprehensive legal framework as well as our strong and independent institutions are well preserved by the Basic Law pursuant to the fundamental and long-lasting principle of ""one country, two systems"". For example, the Basic Law provides constitutional guarantees that the common law system shall continue; the judiciary shall have independent judicial power including that of final adjudication; and the Commission against Corruption shall function independently and be accountable to the Chief Executive.

International co-operation

 Lastly, let me turn to international co-operation, it is essential in the fight against corruption. The United Nations (UN) Convention Against Corruption is applicable to Hong Kong; and Hong Kong is an active member of relevant international organisations such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In the past decade, the Department of Justice has processed over 2 800 mutual legal assistance requests and more than 40 surrender cases that concern offences covered by the UN Convention.

 Another important aspect of international co-operation is capacity building and experience sharing. International independent non-government organisations such as the WPJ clearly play an important role in this respect. Today's conference serves as a prime example and an excellent starting point in our collaboration with WJP in this respect, and I therefore look forward to more collaborations between the WJP and Hong Kong in future. On this note, I wish you all a very constructive and enjoyable conference. Thank you."

「新國風」民族舞劇《李清照》九月以宋詞雅韻舞動「中華文化節」（附圖）,2025-08-26 11:00,2025-08-26 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082500249.htm,"由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）策劃的「中華文化節2025」，將於九月呈獻由上海歌舞團打造的「新國風」民族舞劇《李清照》。此劇作為海派的守正創新之作，以現代視角和藝術形式呈現宋代著名女詞人李清照的曠世才情與跌宕人生，重新詮釋宋代藝術之美，與當代觀眾同頻共振，感受中華優秀傳統文化的博大精深和獨特魅力。此節目為「國風國韻飄香江」系列節目之一。

《李清照》全劇以15個詞牌名為引，透過舞蹈藝術將膾炙人口的詩詞意境串聯起李清照人生的不同階段：從早年在詞壇嶄露頭角的「爭渡，爭渡，驚起一灘鷗鷺」，到上元燈節遇見第一任丈夫趙明誠的一眼萬年；因靖康之變而激出愛國情懷而寫的「生當作人傑，死亦為鬼雄」，到喪夫後哀婉悲苦的「尋尋覓覓，冷冷清清，淒淒慘慘戚戚」；南渡後遭第二任丈夫張汝舟矇騙而寫下「物是人非事事休，欲語淚先流」，最後將目光投向家國天下，「欲將血淚寄山河，去灑東山一抔土」，李清照決定校勘著述《金石錄》，賡續中華文脈。

此劇的創作團隊選取「汝瓷」作為塑造李清照一生的關鍵意象，因汝瓷在燒製過程中由平坦光潔至開片後產生裂紋，恰如李清照的人生。其詞風以宋室南渡為界，從婉約到豪邁的轉變也體現在此劇的舞風中，通過古典舞的韻律與現代舞的創新相融合，傳遞詩詞中的文學意蘊和家國情懷，同時呈現宋韻文化、非物質文化遺產（非遺）和民俗，例如李清照與趙明誠在初相識時的雙人舞便巧用古典舞中的「小五花」表達二人的羞澀和試探；「滾燈舞」一段則汲取中國各地滾燈的表演元素創新編排而成，煥發非遺傳統文化的生命力。

這部秉承海派文化精緻唯美之風的舞劇，舞台美術汲取了宋代美學的精髓，設計簡約雅致，注重對留白的使用，通過月洞門、窗格、桌椅、几案、硯台、筆墨、汝瓷、香爐、茶具、棋盤等道具，勾勒出一幅雅致的宋代生活美學圖景。由於李清照下半生在江南度過，江南的園林、建築特點和民俗風情都在作品中呈現。場景中不少的道具都能從古畫典籍中找到出處，再利用三維打印技術而成，以現代科技煥發中華優秀傳統文化。

舞台調度方面則巧妙地融合舞者的肢體語言與色彩的互動。劇中大量運用中華傳統色，例如以素淨淡雅的「汝瓷」天青色作為主角李清照的主色調，抒情獨舞段則採用清冷色調，市井和朝堂場景則色彩艷麗，上元燈節一段更以藤黃、花青渲染出節日氣氛。音樂方面，宋曲的清靈配上江南絲竹的韻律，並巧妙地融合西方音樂元素，立體呈現宋代之美，江南之韻。

此劇的主創團隊陣容強大，包括由上海歌舞團團長王延擔任製作人兼藝術監製，另邀得知名編舞張帝莎、劉小荷聯袂執導，著名劇作家喻榮軍擔任編劇，集合作曲郭好為、舞美設計胡艷君等業界頂尖人物與一眾優秀青年藝術家精心打造，舞團首席演員周曉輝和榮典‧首席演員王佳俊分別飾演李清照和趙明誠。此劇自去年十月在第二十三屆中國上海國際藝術節開幕式首演以來，好評如潮，並入選二○二四年度國家藝術基金資助項目。

上海歌舞團自1979年成立以來，創作眾多藝術精品，包括舞劇《霸王別姬》、《朱䴉》和《永不消逝的電波》等，並曾獲「五個一工程」獎、文華大奬、國家舞台藝術精品工程、中國舞蹈「荷花獎」金獎等榮譽。藝團曾於全球多個國家及地區演出，在國內外贏得高度讚譽。

明月耀香江——上海歌舞團：舞劇《李清照》九月二十六日及二十七日（星期五及六）晚上七時三十分在香港文化中心大劇院上演。票價分220元、280元、340元、420元及500元，門票現於城市售票網（www.urbtix.hk）發售。電話購票請致電3166 1288。由即日起，購買指定「中華文化節」舞台演出節目、中國戲曲節2025「戲曲電影欣賞」及《大師傳藝‧尋古知新》講座系列可享團體購票或套票優惠。查詢節目詳情及購票優惠，請致電2268 7323，或瀏覽www.ccf.gov.hk/tc/programme/city-under-the-moon-dance-drama-azure-after-the-rain。

"New Chinese-style dance drama ""Azure After the Rain"" to fly high at Chinese Culture Festival with elegance of Song poetry in September (with photos)",2025-08-26 11:00,2025-08-26 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082500286.htm,"  The Chinese Culture Festival (CCF) 2025, organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), will present the new Chinese-style dance drama ""Azure After the Rain"" by the Shanghai Dance Theatre in September. As a Shanghai-style work that preserves traditions while embracing innovation, the production reinterprets the unparalleled literary talent and tumultuous life of the famous Song dynasty poetess Li Qingzhao, as well as the artistic elegance of the Song dynasty from contemporary perspectives and art forms. The performances resonate with today's audiences, allowing them to experience the profound richness and unique allure of fine traditional Chinese culture. This is one of the programmes of the Chinese Performing Arts Hong Kong Season Series.

  ""Azure After the Rain"" unfolds through 15 titles of ""cipai"" (classical poetic song tunes), weaving Li's life journey with dance interpretations of her iconic verses. It begins with Li's early literary fame captured in ""Struggling to get out, struggling to get out, I startled a whole sandbar of egrets into flight"", then depicts her love at first sight with her first husband Zhao Mingcheng during the Lantern Festival. The upheaval of the Catastrophe of Jingkang ignites Li's patriotic defiance with ""In life be a hero among men, in death be a champion among ghosts"", while mournful widowhood finds expression in ""Searching, hunting, seeking, looking, so chilly and yet so clear, distressed, dismal, and forlorn"". After remarrying the deceitful Zhang Ruzhou during the southern migration, her betrayed heart inspired ""The objects are right, the people wrong, everything is over now! About to speak, tears first flow"". The finale transcends personal sorrow as she gazes upon war-torn lands, expressing ""Take my blood-stained tears to those hills and rivers, and sprinkle them on a clod of East Mountain soil"". Li resolved to compile and critique the ""Catalogue of Inscriptions on Metal and Stone"", and to continue the Chinese literary legacy.

  The creative team of the production has chosen Ru porcelain as the key motif embodying Li's life journey, as the cracks that emerge during the firing process - from smooth glaze into a web of intricate fissures - mirror the trajectory of her life. The shift in her poetic style, from lyrical tenderness to bold intensity following the Song dynasty's migration to the south of the Yangtze River, is also reflected in the choreography of the dance drama. By blending the cadence of classical dance with modern dance's innovative expressiveness, the production conveys the literary essence and patriotic sentiments embedded in Li's verses, while showcasing the cultural aesthetics of the Song dynasty, intangible heritage and folk traditions. For instance: the duet between Li and Zhao upon their first encounter ingeniously incorporates the classical dance technique ""xiaowuhua"" (a fluttering hand movement), to convey the timid yet profound connection. Meanwhile, the ""rolling lantern dance"" segment integrates performance elements of rolling lantern (gundeng) traditions from across China, revitalising the cultural vitality of this intangible heritage.

  This dance drama, embodying the refined elegance of Shanghai-style culture, draws inspiration from the aesthetic essence of the Song dynasty. Its stage design is minimalist yet sophisticated, emphasising the artistic use of negative space. Through set pieces such as moon gates, lattice windows, chairs and tables, scholar's desks, inkstones, brushes, Ru porcelain, incense burners, tea sets and chessboards, it sketches an elegant tableau of Song-era living aesthetics. As Li spent the latter half of her life in Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River), the work incorporates the region's garden architecture, structural motifs and folk customs. Many props are meticulously sourced from classical paintings and historical texts using 3D printing technology, bridging modern technology with fine Chinese traditional culture to revitalise its legacy.

  In terms of stage choreography, the production seamlessly blends dancers' movements with dynamic colourful interplay, and extensively employs traditional Chinese hues. For instance, the serene celadon (azure after the rain) tone of Ru porcelain serves as the dominant tone for Li, while her introspective solos adopt cooler shades. Bustling market and court scenes burst with vibrant colours, and the Lantern Festival sequence dazzles with vine-yellow (tenghuang) and flower-blue (huaqing) tones to evoke festive exuberance. For music, the ethereal melodies of Song-era tunes intertwine with the rhythmic textures of Jiangnan silk-and-bamboo music, subtly infused with Western elements, creating a multidimensional homage to the charms of the Song dynasty and Jiangnan.

  The creative team boasts an all-star lineup: Shanghai Dance Theatre's director Wang Yan serves as producer and artistic supervisor, joined by acclaimed choreographers Zhang Disha and Liu Xiaohe as chief directors, with renowned playwright Yu Rongjun, composer Guo Haowei, set designer Hu Yanjun, and more, which is a collaboration of industry luminaries and emerging talent. The production stars the troupe's chief dancer Zhou Xiaohui, and chief dancer with honour and glory Wang Jiajun, portraying Li Qingzhao and Zhao Mingcheng, respectively. Since its premiere as the opening programme of the 23rd China Shanghai International Arts Festival in October last year, the production has garnered acclaim and was selected as a 2024 China National Arts Fund support project.

  Since its establishment in 1979, the Shanghai Dance Theatre has produced numerous artistic masterpieces, including the dance drama ""Farewell to My Concubine"", ""Crested Ibises"", ""The Eternal Wave"", and more. The troupe has been honoured with prestigious awards such as the Five One Project Award, the Wenhua Grand Award, the National Fine Stage Arts Project Award and the Gold Award of the China Dance Lotus Award. The troupe has performed in many countries and regions worldwide, earning widespread acclaim both domestically and internationally.
