Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-14 06:45,2025-09-14 07:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400009.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 14) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

On July 31, the CFS noted that a batch of Korean cake product was found to contain mould. The CFS immediately initiated an investigation and confirmed that the affected batch of product had not been imported into Hong Kong. A food incident post was published online on the same day to inform the public.

The CFS also promptly established direct communication with the Korean authority regarding the matter. On September 12, the CFS received a notification from the Korean authority that another batch of the imported product (Orion FISH SHAPED CAKE, 6PCS, 174 grams, best before December 9, 2025) might be affected by mould. The CFS immediately contacted and instructed the distributor to stop sales, remove from shelves the affected product and initiate a recall. A press release was also issued today.

The delegation attended a seminar on advantages of Hong Kong's common law system and met with local leaders to promote Hong Kong's legal and other professional services, with a view to strengthening the co-operation between Hong Kong and Xinjiang and jointly contributing to the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative.
  
  Mr Lam yesterday afternoon (September 12) attended a seminar on the role of Hong Kong's common law system in contributing to the development of the Belt and Road Initiative and a networking dinner organised by the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Xinjiang Lawyers Association, participants included Xinjiang's business and legal representatives. At the seminar, legal representatives from the delegation addressed key legal issues in cross-border business operations, and explained how Hong Kong's legal services can help safeguard cross-border investment and trade, while representatives from the financial sector highlighted Hong Kong's advantages as a financing platform for enterprises. Other delegates also shared relevant case studies and practical experiences. Mr Lam said that Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction in China, and possesses unique strengths of internationalisation, high standards, and strong credibility in its common law system. As an international legal and dispute resolution services centre, Hong Kong's professional service teams are capable and willing to leverage their expertise to contribute to Xinjiang's high-quality development.
  
  During the seminar, the DoJ and the Department of Justice of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region signed a framework agreement for legal service co-operation. Under the agreement, the department of justice of the two places will foster exchanges and business co-operation between Xinjiang and Hong Kong's legal sector. Additionally, the Hong Kong Bar Association signed a memorandum of co-operation with the Xinjiang Lawyers Association to strengthen the collaboration between Xinjiang lawyers and Hong Kong barristers, promoting further professional exchanges and co-operation between the legal professions of Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

Customs officers intercepted the incoming 31-year-old female passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (September 12) and seized 10 381 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $42,000 and a duty potential of about $34,000 from her personal baggage.

The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

At the invitation of the congress organiser, Dr Lam delivered a keynote speech on the theme of ""Openness, Co-operation, Co-construction and Sharing"". ""HKSAR's health indicators and healthcare quality rank among the world's best. Facing challenges such as aging population, technological advancement, and shifts in lifestyles and environmental conditions, institutional and technological innovation in healthcare will be the best way to ensure the sustainable development of medical services. In alignment with the strategies for healthcare reform and innovation outlined in the 'Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address', the Department of Health (DH) of the HKSAR will officially establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of next year (2026), the Centre will consolidate regulatory functions for Western and Chinese medicines, as well as medical devices, and enhance the existing regulatory regime in a holistic manner. Furthermore, the DH will implement 'primary evaluation' for new drug registration in phases beginning next year, with full implementation by 2030. This initiative will reduce Hong Kong's reliance on overseas regulatory authorities for 'secondary evaluation' (i.e. applicants must provide approval from the drug regulatory authorities of at least two reference places for registration in Hong Kong). The initiative will also help the HKSAR to develop an internationally renowned medical products regulatory authority, drive the development of the local healthcare and biotechnology industries, and enable the public to benefit from the latest scientific research. Patients will have earlier access to innovative medical products that have been proven to be safe and effective, achieving the goal of making effective drugs and medical devices available in Hong Kong,"" he said.

""Thanks to the strong support of the nation and leveraging the advantages of 'One Country, Two Systems', the HKSAR has been accepted as an observer by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). We will now actively pursue membership to promote the recognition of registration approvals in Hong Kong internationally, continuously injecting strong momentum into the development of the healthcare industries in Hong Kong and the Mainland,"" Dr Lam added.

Dr Lam's visit to Beijing was at the invitation of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission (BJHC) to attend the 2025 China International Fair for Trade in Services. During his stay, he led a delegation from the DH to meet with relevant public health and medical products regulatory institutions in Beijing to deepen exchanges and collaboration. Additionally, over the past three days (September 10-12), the delegation called on the National Health Commission (NHC), National Disease Control and Prevention Administration (NDCPA), the Department of Medical Emergency Response and the Department of Medical Administration. They were received by the Vice Minister of the NHC and the Administrator of the NDCPA, Professor Shen Hongbing. The delegation also called on the Health and Quarantine Department of the General Administration of Customs, the National Center for Mental Health and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

During these meetings, the delegation and the Mainland officials engaged in in-depth discussions on a wide range of public health issues, including joint prevention mechanism in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area; the latest developments in communicable disease surveillance; vaccination programmes; chronic disease prevention and control; cancer screening and prevention; port health quarantine measures; mental health promotion; professional exchange initiatives; and enhancing the regulation of drugs and medical devices. The DH also signed agreements with the BJHC and the Beijing Municipal Disease Prevention and Control Administration. These agreements lay a solid foundation for deepening future co-operation, and the sharing of experiences, resources and achievements.

""Thanks to the strong support of the nation and leveraging the advantages of 'One Country, Two Systems', the HKSAR has been accepted as an observer by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). We will now actively pursue membership to promote the recognition of registration approvals in Hong Kong internationally, continuously injecting strong momentum into the development of the healthcare industries in Hong Kong and the Mainland,"" Dr Lam added.

Dr Lam's visit to Beijing was at the invitation of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission (BJHC) to attend the 2025 China International Fair for Trade in Services. During his stay, he led a delegation from the DH to meet with relevant public health and medical products regulatory institutions in Beijing to deepen exchanges and collaboration. Additionally, over the past three days (September 10-12), the delegation called on the National Health Commission (NHC), National Disease Control and Prevention Administration (NDCPA), the Department of Medical Emergency Response and the Department of Medical Administration. They were received by the Vice Minister of the NHC and the Administrator of the NDCPA, Professor Shen Hongbing. The delegation also called on the Health and Quarantine Department of the General Administration of Customs, the National Center for Mental Health and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

During these meetings, the delegation and the Mainland officials engaged in in-depth discussions on a wide range of public health issues, including joint prevention mechanism in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area; the latest developments in communicable disease surveillance; vaccination programmes; chronic disease prevention and control; cancer screening and prevention; port health quarantine measures; mental health promotion; professional exchange initiatives; and enhancing the regulation of drugs and medical devices. The DH also signed agreements with the BJHC and the Beijing Municipal Disease Prevention and Control Administration. These agreements lay a solid foundation for deepening future co-operation, and the sharing of experiences, resources and achievements. The capacity and accessibility of medical and health service systems in both places will also be greatly enhanced.

The DH delegation concluded its visit to Beijing today and returned to Hong Kong."

今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。雖然廣東省基孔肯雅熱的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

本港今年累計錄得16宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。​

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-13 17:30,2025-09-13 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/13/P2025091300595.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 13), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other regions that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, etc. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 16 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

林文健醫生應大會邀請，圍繞「開放合作共建共享」主題發表演講。他說：「香港特區的健康指標及醫療質效在世界均處於領先之列。面對人口老齡化、科技進步、生活模式及環境變化等挑戰下，醫療衞生方面的制度及科技創新和發展將是確保醫衞服務可持續發展的不二之選。配合行政長官於二○二四年《施政報告》中有關醫療衞生改革創新的各項策略，衞生署明年（二○二六）年底前將正式成立『香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心』（『藥械監管中心』），整合西藥、中藥及醫療器械的監管職能，全面提升現行制度。此外，衞生署自明年起分階段實施『第一層審批』新藥註冊機制，目標在二○三○年全面推行，突破香港長期依賴海外藥監機構『第二層審批』的局限（即藥物須獲至少兩個參考地方機構批准方能申請在港註冊），助力香港特區發展藥械領域的國際權威監管機構，推動本地醫療及生物科技產業的發展，同時亦讓市民受惠於最新科研成果、讓病人及早獲得經實證安全有效的創新藥械，實現『好藥港用、好械港用』。」

他續說：「感謝國家鼎力支持，築基於一國兩制的優勢，香港特區獲國際醫藥法規協調會議接納成為觀察員，現將積極申請加入成為會員，進而可進一步推動創新藥物審批結果國際互認，為香港和國家的醫療健康產業發展不斷注入強大動力。」

林文健醫生這次到北京，是應北京市衞生健康委員會（北京衞健委）邀請，出席二○二五年中國國際服務貿易交易會，期間並分別率領署方代表團與北京市衞生及藥械監管相關部門會晤，深化交流協作。除此以外，代表團在過去三日（九月十至十二日）分別拜訪了國家衞生健康委員會（國家衞健委）、國家疾病預防控制局、醫療應急司、醫政司，並獲國家衞健委副主任、國家疾病預防控制局局長沈洪兵接見。代表團亦會晤了中國海關總署衞生檢疫司、國家心理健康和精神衞生防治中心、中國疾病預防控制中心等。該些會面中，交流雙方就廣泛的公共衞生議題作深入討論，包括粵港澳大灣區聯防聯控的工作、傳染病監測的最新發展方向、疫苗接種計劃、慢性疾病防控、癌症篩查防治、港口衞生檢疫措施、精神健康推廣、專業人員交流計劃，及提升藥品器械規管等。衞生署更與北京市衞健委和北京市疾病預防控制局簽署協議，為日後深化合作、共享經驗資源和成果等築牢基礎，對提升雙方醫療衞生服務體系的能力和可及性等，有莫大裨益。

衞生署代表團今日結束北京的行程返港。"

Winfried（香港賽馬會行政總裁應家柏）、Kenneth（立法會議員霍啟剛）、小曼（香港青年協會總幹事徐小曼）、劉翀先生（香港小童群益會總幹事）、方炎閑小姐（凝動香港體育基金董事會成員）、各位嘉賓、各位球員、各位教練、各位現場的小球員們、各位觀眾朋友：

大家早晨。很高興今日可以出席香港青年協會（青協）、凝動香港體育基金，和香港小童群益會共同舉辦的賽馬會越戰越強籃球計劃的啓動禮。

青協和小童群益會是在香港扎根數十年的機構，它們一直致力促進青少年和兒童的全面發展。十多年前成立的凝動香港體育基金專注於為基層和有特殊教育需要的中小學生提供體育培訓。雖然這三個機構各有不同的服務重點，但它們共同的核心理念同樣是守護和扶育我們的下一代，讓他們茁壯成長，日後成為社會的中堅力量。

因此，我今日特別高興，亦特別感謝賽馬會慈善信託基金慷慨捐款，支持這三個機構共同展開越戰越強籃球計劃。這個計劃像剛才Winfried所說，除了是體育訓練外，其實是一個全面的成長平台，通過由教練、社工、運動心理學家組成的專業團隊，為不同年齡和水平的學員，提供度身訂造的訓練和個人成長計劃。計劃包括海外交流學習的機會，讓青少年在參與籃球運動中建立健康的生活模式，培養積極進取的人生態度。這個計劃充分整合和凝聚多方力量，發揮強大的協同效應，為香港未來注入更多動力和希望。

提到體育活動，剛才Winfried已經提過，我們今年十一月和十二月粵港澳會合辦第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，這兩場盛會將是香港有史以來最大規模的體育盛事。我們非常感謝香港賽馬會鼎力支持，成為香港賽區的唯一合作夥伴。事實上，馬會亦是我們不同體育項目的最大合作夥伴。我們將承辦全運會八個競賽項目，其中包括籃球男子22歲以下組別的籃球賽，（賽事）將於十一月十日至二十日在香港體育館，即紅館舉行。剛才運動員亦告訴我，他們亦有份參與。屆時，香港隊將與12支內地頂尖球隊角逐殊榮。我希望在座各位熱愛籃球的朋友踴躍購票入場，現在已可以開始購票，屆時不但可以觀賞全國最高水平的籃球賽事，最重要是可以為香港隊的運動員打氣，得享主場之利，讓他們感受到籃球的精彩、刺激，運動員亦感受到全個社會都大力支持和鼓勵他們。

今日的賽馬會越戰越強籃球計劃為期三年，有三萬多的年輕人受惠。祝願賽馬會越戰越強籃球計劃好像其名字一樣，越戰越強，取得圓滿成功，各位學員亦可以盡展潛能、越戰越強。

多謝大家。"
