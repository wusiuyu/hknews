政務司司長主持節慶安排跨部門工作小組會議（附圖）,2026-02-06 17:10,2026-02-06 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600565.htm,"政務司司長陳國基今日（二月六日）主持節慶安排跨部門工作小組會議，全面統籌並督導各政府部門就內地春節黃金周期間（即二月十五日至二十三日）接待訪港旅客的預備工作。保安局局長鄧炳強、文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩、運輸及物流局副局長廖振新、環境及生態局副局長黃淑嫻，以及其他相關政府部門的代表出席會議。

陳國基說：「一連九日的內地春節黃金周即將來臨，不同慶祝活動將會接連舉行，為市民及旅客帶來濃厚的節日氣氛。預計內地春節黃金周期間訪港旅客會明顯增加，香港特別行政區（特區）政府會做好接待訪港旅客預備工作，包括積極協調及統籌口岸和交通配套，並與相關機構及旅遊業界保持緊密聯繫，做好人流管理、信息發布、公共交通及各口岸安排，確保各項接待旅客的環節能運作暢順，為訪港旅客提供優質體驗。」

旅客流量估算及預備工作

按照入境事務處（入境處）的估算，預計一連九日的內地春節黃金周期間，約有143萬內地旅客經各海、陸、空管制站進入香港，每日平均訪港人次較去年內地春節黃金周增加約百分之六。

根據旅遊業監管局（旅監局）和業界的估算，在內地春節黃金周期間預計有2 200個旅行團入境香港，日均入境團數對比去年內地勞動節及國慶黃金周有明顯增長。各個主要旅遊景點已制定特別方案，以應付預期增加的人流。預計內地春節黃金周期間香港市面將會更加熱鬧暢旺，為各行各業帶來機遇。

內地春節黃金周期間，全港各區將舉行一系列豐富的慶祝活動，包括二月十七日（年初一）舉辦的大年初一國泰新春國際匯演之夜，以及在二月十八日（年初二）的農曆新年煙花匯演。香港警務處會安排足夠警力，按需要實施相應的人群管理措施和特別交通安排，確保所有慶祝活動安全有序地進行。而各區民政事務處亦會密切留意區內的旅客人流情況，並按實際情況通報相關部門，以加強相關地點的管理安排。

協調口岸和交通及公共運輸配套

特區政府經審慎考慮相關情況，包括香港今年農曆新年假期期間大型活動的舉行時間及相關安排，以及二〇二四年農曆新年延長個別口岸通關時間的經驗，並經與內地相關部門溝通協調，決定在今年農曆新年假期期間維持現行通關時間。落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋口岸會如常24小時通關。特區政府呼籲旅客提前規劃行程，並在參與各項本地農曆新年慶祝活動後留港過夜，充分體驗香港各區豐富多元的慶祝活動，感受香港獨特的城市魅力。

口岸部門已減少前線人員休假，以便彈性調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱、臨時櫃枱及通道以疏導人流及車流。由警務處、入境處、香港海關及相關部門成立的跨部門聯合指揮中心，會於二月十四日（星期六）至二月二十三日（星期一）啓動，實時監察口岸現場情況，並與內地口岸部門透過已建立的口岸熱線及即時通報機制保持緊密聯繫，於有需要時作出迅速應變及調動，靈活調配各管制站人手，確保陸路口岸運作暢順。保安局亦會在內地春節黃金周期間啓動緊急事故監察及支援中心，密切監察和統籌各口岸的公眾秩序。中心並會在有需要時協調跨部門的跟進行動，以迅速應對各種突發情況。

公共運輸安排方面，運輸署已主動聯繫各相關公共運輸營運商加大運力，並在進出境高峰期間預留足夠備用車輛及人手以應對乘客的出行需求；其中，香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）將於二月十三日（星期五）至二十三日（星期一）期間重點加強東鐵綫不同時段的列車服務，而大部分本地鐵路線會於二月十六日（星期一，年廿九）提供通宵服務，並因應二月十七日（年初一）的花車巡遊及二月十八日（年初二）的煙花匯演加強服務，以方便本地市民和旅客出行。運輸署亦會配合口岸安排，已協調相關營運商加強連接各邊境管制站的交通服務，包括增加港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）的班次至最高峰時約一分鐘一班、增加落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的班次至最密約兩分鐘一班，以及增發跨境直通巴士配額以加強服務；並制定預案，在有需要時於港珠澳大橋口岸、落馬洲／皇崗口岸及深圳灣口岸實施特別交通管理安排，包括啓動公共交通專用通道，確保公交服務暢順。另外，在二月十七日（星期二，年初一）至二月十九日（星期四，年初三）凌晨，加設九巴第N73號特別巴士服務（港鐵上水站往新田），在東鐵綫前往羅湖站的服務結束後，接載乘客轉乘皇巴，經24小時通關的落馬洲／皇崗口岸前往內地。

運輸署的緊急事故交通協調中心於內地春節黃金周期間24小時運作，全面監察全港各區（包括旅客熱點）、各邊境管制站和主要車站的交通和公共運輸服務情況，並適時採取措施，應對服務需求，並透過各種渠道發放最新的交通消息。

因應內地春節黃金周期間到訪西貢萬宜水庫東壩及鹹田灣等營地的旅客數量或會明顯增加，警方已作出針對性的部署，包括調派軍裝人員於旅客抵達及離開之高峰時段在北潭涌、西貢萬宜路及東壩的策略性位置進行交通及人流管制；漁農自然護理署（漁護署）繼早前加建圍障及豎立警告牌等安全措施外，亦會在有需要時於萬宜地質步道─破邊洲段入口實施臨時人流管制措施，避免景點過度擠擁；而運輸署已與專線小巴營辦商協調，因應乘客量增加第9A號線（北潭涌—萬宜水庫東壩）的小巴班次。另外，政府已加強於鹹田灣、西灣及浪茄灣的管理工作，以鹹田灣的營地及公廁為例，漁護署及食物環境衞生署會在今個周末（二月七日及八日）及在二月十四日至二十三日期間聯合採取特別管理安排，包括每日安排人手清潔營地及清理垃圾桶和安排廁所事務員值勤，加強營地巡邏及宣傳教育，以及安裝網絡攝錄機以監察公廁外圍的清潔情況。

旅行團管理及保障旅客安排

旅監局已提醒接待內地入境旅行團的旅行代理商盡量分散入境時間，並協調景點等相關單位採取適當分流措施，做好人流和旅遊巴的管理工作，為旅客帶來良好旅遊體驗。旅監局亦會巡查入境旅行團註冊商店較多的地區，以及向旅客和導遊提供協助，以保障入境旅行團旅客的權益。此外，警方會繼續加強執法，打擊的士司機濫收車資、拒載等違法行為，海關亦會加強巡查接待旅客的店鋪，打擊不良營商手法。
​
為確保旅遊景點，如尖沙咀海傍及山頂等一帶交通暢順，警方將會加強執法，打擊造成交通擠塞的相關罪行，以及對造成嚴重阻塞或即時危險的違泊車輛，在沒有事前警告的情況下票控及即時拖走。

天氣預報

由於內地春節黃金周期間本港仍是冬季，預料本港間中會受季候風影響而氣溫下降，但受暴雨或熱帶氣旋等惡劣天氣影響的機會不大。香港天文台會盡早發放相關天氣資訊，旅客出遊前請留意天文台的九天天氣預報及最新天氣警告信息。

資訊發布

為便利旅客規劃行程，跨部門工作小組及相關部門會加強資訊發布，包括最新入境旅客數字、各邊境管制站情況、活動資訊、交通安排及最新天氣信息等，方便市民及旅客按最新情況規劃行程。

香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）已推出一站式新春節慶專頁（www.discoverhongkong.com/tc/what-s-new/events/chinese-new-year.html），匯聚全港主要的賀歲活動及內地春節黃金周期間的實用資訊，包括主要旅遊景點開放時間、輪候時間、各項特色慶祝活動詳情，以及各項公共交通、過境服務安排等資訊，方便旅客提早計劃新春行程，深入體驗香港的節慶文化。旅發局亦加強在內地宣傳，透過與內地熱門平台及人氣網紅合作，推廣香港地道美食及新春特色體驗，吸引更多內地旅客訪港消費，提升整體旅遊體驗。

市民及旅客亦可瀏覽保安局推出的一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound），一次過取得各陸路邊境管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及港珠澳大橋過境穿梭巴士和落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士的平均輪候時間等有用資訊，以便計劃行程及減省等候時間。"

  The Award Scheme is a biennial flagship event for the local T&C industry. This year, both applications and awardees reached record highs, reflecting the industry's support for and acknowledgement of the importance of manpower development. A total of 71 awards were presented to 46 outstanding T&C bodies in talent training and professional development, and 25 T&C practitioners in recognition of their striving for continuous learning and commitment to service excellence.

The success of the industry depended on the participation and collaboration of its practitioners to build a better society.

  The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, spoke highly of the T&C industry's contributions to Hong Kong's economy and innovation and technology development. He said that the professional integrity of the T&C industry has forged the prestigious brand of ""Tested in Hong Kong, Certified in Hong Kong"".

He said he hopes the industry will continue to contribute its professional expertise to the development of Hong Kong and the country.

  Since its first launch in 2021, the Award Scheme includes two categories of awards - the Testing and Certification Manpower Development Corporate Award and the Excellent Testing and Certification Professional Award. There are two tiers of awards, i.e. the Platinum Award and the Gold Award under the Corporate Award category. As regards the Professional Award category, it encompasses two sub-groups of the Senior Professional and Junior Professional respectively.

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and importing prohibited articles not under and in accordance with import licence (with photo),2026-02-06 17:10,2026-02-06 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600473.htm,"​An incoming male passenger was sentenced to two months' imprisonment and fined $2,000 by the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts today (February 6) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing prohibited articles not under and in accordance with the import licence, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

 Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 42, at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point on February 5. About 2 174 duty-not-paid cigarettes and five tablets of pharmaceutical products labelled as containing Part I Poisons, with a total estimated market value of about $11,000 and a duty potential of about $7,100, were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

 Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

 Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

 Under the IEO, any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

 Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
CS chairs interdepartmental working group meeting on festival arrangements (with photos),2026-02-06 17:10,2026-02-06 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600576.htm,"  The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, today (February 6) chaired a meeting of the interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements to holistically co-ordinate and steer the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland (i.e. from February 15 to 23). The Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law; the Under Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mr Liu Chun-sun; the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, and representatives from other relevant government departments also attended.

  Mr Chan said, ""We are approaching the nine-day Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. Various celebration activities will take place to create a rich New Year ambience for residents and visitors. We estimate a notable increase in visitor arrivals during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will make good preparations for receiving visitors, including diligently co-ordinating the ancillary arrangements of boundary control points (BCPs) and transportation, as well as maintaining close liaison with relevant organisations and the travel trade to prepare well for crowd management, information dissemination and arrangements of public transportation and BCPs, with a view to ensuring the smooth operation of various aspects in receiving visitors and offering a high-quality experience to them.""

Estimated visitor flow and preparatory work

  According to the Immigration Department (ImmD)'s estimate, around 1.43 million Mainland visitors will visit Hong Kong via various sea, land and air control points during the nine-day Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. Compared with last year's Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, the daily average visitor arrivals will increase by about 6 per cent.

  According to the estimate of the Travel Industry Authority (TIA) and the trade, it is anticipated that 2 200 inbound tour groups will visit Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, with the average daily number of inbound tour groups notably higher than that of last year’s Labour Day and National Day Golden Week of the Mainland. Major tourist spots have formulated special arrangements to handle the estimated increase in people flow. The Hong Kong community is expected to become more vibrant and highly patronised during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, bringing opportunities to various sectors.

  There will be a rich array of activities across the territory during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. Major events include the Cathay International Chinese New Year Night Parade on February 17 (Lunar New Year's Day) and the Lunar New Year Fireworks Display on February 18 (the second day of Lunar New Year). The Hong Kong Police Force will ensure sufficient police manpower to implement corresponding crowd management measures and special traffic arrangements as necessary for the events to be conducted in a safe and orderly manner. District offices will also closely monitor the flow of visitors within their respective districts and notify relevant departments having regard to the actual circumstances with a view to strengthening management of the relevant spots.

Co-ordinate control points, traffic and public transport facilities

  The HKSAR Government has given due consideration to the relevant circumstances, including the schedules and arrangements of mega events in Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year holiday this year, as well as the experience of extending the operating hours of individual BCPs during the 2024 Chinese New Year, and decided, in discussion with relevant Mainland authorities, to maintain the existing operating hours of the BCPs during this year's Chinese New Year holiday. The Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Port will maintain a 24-hour operation as usual. The HKSAR Government appeals to visitors to plan ahead for their itineraries and stay overnight after participating in various local celebratory activities for the Chinese New Year to fully enjoy the rich and diverse celebratory activities to be held across various districts in the city and experience Hong Kong's unique city charm.

  Relevant departments have minimised leave for frontline officers to enable flexible deployment of manpower and operation of additional counters, temporary counters and channels, with a view to diverting passenger and vehicular flow. The Inter-departmental Joint Command Centre set up by the Police, the ImmD, the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), and other relevant departments will be activated from February 14 (Saturday) to February 23 (Monday) to monitor the real-time situation at various control points. The Joint Command Centre will maintain close liaison with the Mainland port authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanism and take timely contingency actions as necessary to flexibly deploy manpower at BCPs to ensure smooth operation of the land control points. The Security Bureau will activate the Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland to closely monitor and co-ordinate the public order situation at various BCPs and facilitate interdepartmental follow-up actions where necessary to respond promptly to various kinds of emergencies.

  For public transport arrangements, the Transport Department (TD) has proactively approached various public transport operators to enhance their capacity and reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet the travel needs of visitors during peak periods. Among them, the MTR Corporation Limited will significantly enhance the service of the East Rail Line at different periods during the period between February 13 (Friday) and February 23 (Monday). Most local railway lines will operate overnight on February 16 (Monday, Lunar New Year’s Eve). Services on the relevant railway lines will be strengthened after the Night Parade on February 17 (Lunar New Year’s Day) and the Fireworks Display on February 18 (the second day of Lunar New Year) for the convenience of residents and visitors. The TD will also cater for the arrangements of BCPs and has co-ordinated with relevant operators to enhance transportation services connecting various BCPs, including increasing the frequency of HZMB shuttle bus (Gold Bus) to about one minute during peak hours, and Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to about two minutes at its highest frequency, as well as increasing the quota of cross-boundary coaches to strengthen services, and formulating a contingency plan by implementing special traffic control measures as necessary, including providing a dedicated passage for public transport vehicles at the HZMB Port, the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Shenzhen Bay Port to ensure smooth public transport services. Furthermore, in the early hours from February 17 (Tuesday, Lunar New Year's Day) to February 19 (Thursday, the third day of Lunar New Year), after the service hours of the East Rail Line trains to Lo Wu Station, special bus service of KMB Route No. N73 (MTR Sheung Shui Station to San Tin) will be provided to carry passengers to interchange to the Yellow Bus for their journey to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port, which operates round-the-clock.

  The Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre of the TD will operate 24 hours a day during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland to closely monitor the traffic conditions and public transport services in all districts (including tourist hotspots), BCPs, and major stations across Hong Kong and take prompt measures to address service demands and disseminate the latest traffic updates through various channels.

  In view of the anticipated large number of tourists visiting Sai Kung High Island Reservoir East Dam and campsites including Ham Tin Wan Campsite during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, the Police have taken targeted measures, including deploying uniformed officers at strategic locations at Pak Tam Chung, Sai Kung Man Yee Road and East Dam, for traffic and crowd management during peak visitor arrival and departure periods. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), in addition to safety measures implemented earlier such as adding barriers and putting up warning signs, will implement temporary crowd control measures at the entrance of the High Island Geo Trail - Po Pin Chau Section when necessary to prevent overcrowding at the site. The TD has co-ordinated with the operator to enhance the service of GMB Route No. 9A (Pak Tam Chung - High Island Reservoir East Dam) subject to passenger demand. Furthermore, the Government has strengthened management efforts at Ham Tin Wan, Sai Wan, and Long Ke Wan. For instance, at the campsite and public toilets in Ham Tin Wan, the AFCD and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department will jointly implement special management arrangements this weekend (February 7 and 8) and from February 14 to 23. These measures include deploying staff daily to clean the campsite and empty trash bins, assigning toilet attendants on duty, enhancing campsite patrols and public education, and installing network cameras to monitor the cleanliness of the areas around the public toilets.

Management of tour groups and protection of visitors

  The TIA has reminded travel agents receiving Mainland inbound tour groups to stagger arrival times as far as possible, and co-ordinate with relevant parties including attractions to adopt appropriate diversion measures to enable proper management of visitor flows and tour buses, with a view to offering a pleasant travel experience to visitors. The TIA will also conduct inspections in districts where relatively more registered shops for inbound tour groups are located, and offer assistance to visitors and tourist guides to protect inbound tour group visitors' rights. Additionally, the Police will continue to step up enforcement actions against the illegal acts of taxi drivers including overcharging and refusing hire. The C&ED will also step up inspection of shops serving visitors to combat unfair trade practices.

  To ensure smooth traffic flow in tourist areas such as the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront and the Peak, the Police will step up enforcement actions against offenses causing traffic congestion. Illegally parked vehicles that cause serious obstruction or pose an immediate danger will be ticketed and towed away immediately without prior warning.

Weather forecast

  As Hong Kong will still be in winter during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, it is expected that the city may occasionally experience temperature drops due to the monsoon. The chances of being affected by severe weather such as heavy rain or tropical cyclones are relatively low. The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) will release relevant weather information as early as possible. Travellers are advised to check the HKO’s nine-day weather forecast and the latest weather warnings before travelling.

Information dissemination

  To assist visitors in planning their itineraries, the interdepartmental working group and relevant departments will strengthen information dissemination, including the latest inbound visitor arrivals, the situation at various BCPs, information on events, transport arrangements, and latest weather forecast, to enable residents and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation.

  The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) has launched a one-stop Chinese New Year festive webpage (www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/what-s-new/events/chinese-new-year.html), which consolidates major Chinese New Year events in Hong Kong and practical information for the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. The webpage includes information about the opening hours and waiting times of major tourist attractions, information on unique celebratory activities, and updates on public transport and cross-border service arrangements, enabling visitors to plan their trips in advance and experience Hong Kong’s festive culture in depth. The HKTB has also stepped up promotions on the Mainland by partnering with popular platforms and influencers to showcase authentic local delicacies and unique Chinese New Year experiences to attract more Mainland visitors to visit and spend in Hong Kong and enhance their overall travel experiences.

  Residents and visitors may visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, to obtain useful information on ""Easy Boundary"" in one go, including the respective average waiting times for passengers and private cars at land BCPs, as well as for the HZMB cross-boundary shuttle bus and the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus, to plan their trips and save waiting times."

二月份第一批涵蓋27個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數，全部均為0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

與上月（即二○二六年一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這27個監察區中，全部監察地區的指數均下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自二○二五年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區62個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。在監察期間，食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the first batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 27 survey areas in February, all were 0 per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

Among these 27 survey areas, all recorded a decrease or remained unchanged as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month (i.e. January 2026), representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August 2025, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever (DF). At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 62 survey areas of the community, with a surveillance period of two weeks. During the surveillance period, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

運輸及物流局局長在《運輸策略藍圖》記者會開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-06 16:46,2026-02-06 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600541.htm,"​以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（二月六日）在《運輸策略藍圖》（《藍圖》）記者會的開場發言：

各位市民、各位傳媒朋友：

交通運輸是現代都市的基石，關係着經濟發展，大灣區融合，更重要是市民生活的日常。我們團隊按最新的土地規劃，考慮最新的科技發展，制訂了《運輸策略藍圖》，定出未來的工作目標、策略和方向，制定短、中、長期的措施，為香港的經濟發展謀動力，令市民的生活更便捷。

《藍圖》以「政策創新」與「技術創新」的「雙創新」思維，前瞻未來二十多年的發展願景。我們將繼續以鐵路為骨幹，並會提升公共交通服務及促進運輸發展進一步邁向智能化、靈活化；亦會促進跨境交通，加強人流與物流的互聯互通。

《藍圖》所訂的三大主題與六大策略架構共提出25項具體建議，稍後同事會作較詳細的介紹。最重要的是，在勾劃宏觀、前瞻的布局的同時，亦要令市民感受到，我們可以回應市民需要、增加便利，以及日常出行時所關注的事項。在此，我想先特別提出今年內我們的10項重點措施：

（一）首先是基建，我們會強化本地和跨境運輸基建，在「八縱八橫」的運輸基建布局下，首要在今年內全線開通六號幹線，全力推展一系列鐵路及主要道路項目。我們亦會開展研究港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海）南向延伸方案，加上在策略地點如洪水橋、新田、紅磡等規劃多元化、最新的運輸交匯樞紐，連通港九新界、市區及北部都會區各個經濟和居住區域，帶動經濟發展、促進人員往來及加快貨物暢通流動；

（二）第二亦與「八縱八橫」相關，我們會研究擴大過海交通容量不同方案的可行性，包括現有倡議的走線或擴建現有隧道等；

（三）在啟德、東九龍及洪水橋／厦村新發展區推展智慧綠色集體運輸系統。啟德的項目將於今年內批出合約，而東九龍及洪水橋／厦村新發展區的項目（第一階段）亦會於今年內招標；

（四）公共交通方面，本港公交系統「世一」，每日接近九成出行人次使用公交出行。我們會善用科技，為乘客提供更具效率的公交服務。我們會於今年內推出「需求導向智慧公交」的試行路線，目的是在現行公交服務之上，透過靈活調派車輛，照顧乘客需求。我們會與專營巴士公司一同探討不同應用場景，例如在偏遠地區或是客流較分散的時段提供加強服務；

（五）在個人化點對點服務方面，預計首批持牌網約車平台最快可於今年第四季開始營運，讓的士與網約車並存互補；

（六）對駕駛者來講，我們會致力透過「一地多用」提供泊車位、自動泊車系統等一系列措施增加車位供應。我們正推進在今年內達成我們於去年定下兩年間新增逾12 000個私家車及商用車位的目標。我們亦將展開新一輪泊車位供求研究，全面檢視尤其是商用車的停泊情況及需求，長遠做到「商用車輛，夜有所泊」；

（七）科技應用方面，我們將緊貼大數據和人工智能發展，推動數字化交通管理，令市民出行更具效率。我們會籌備市區內首個交通管理平台試點應用項目，向公眾提供更多、更實時的交通資訊以規劃行程；

（八）成立由運輸署署長主持的自動駕駛車輛應用促進工作組，跨部門聯同行業持份者審視自動車項目的進度與需求，訂立自動駕駛載客營運路線圖，並就自動車的測試地點及車輛類別，以及為配合自動車邁向商業營運所需要的牌證安排提供督導。最重要的是，我們會在今年內努力爭取陸續推出多個跨區項目，包括「航天走廊」載客服務、積極推進在東涌、機場及啟德等項目邁向無人化；

（九）積極布局低空經濟，制訂《發展低空經濟規劃行動綱領》，構建具國際競爭力的低空經濟生態圈，促進現代運輸發展。「監管沙盒」中多於20個較為成熟、風險相對較低的項目，例如無人機進行外牆清洗、電纜、鐵路設施檢視等會進入實際運作；及

（十）我們務求做到人車兼顧，因此更會便利行人，令出行體驗更佳、更省時。我們擴展實時燈號調節，以人工智能分析路口的即時車流和行人流量，計算最合適的燈號時間，加強路口運作效率；亦會在全港更多地點設立對角行人過路處，減少行人通過十字路口的時間。

以上是《藍圖》下今年的重點工作。《藍圖》以宏觀視野為香港未來20年的發展提供動力之外，我亦希望每位市民能夠在當中感受到我們以一個字，就是「人」作為核心思想，期望令大家在不久的將來，便可在日常的生活細節中，感受到更完善的交通網絡、更貼心的公交服務和更易行的城市環境所帶來的好處。

整體而言，《藍圖》的制定響應國家策略，對接「十五五規劃」建議，透過宏觀的基建布局，結合科技創新，吸引國家交通科企來港，共同構建香港未來的運輸體系，以支撐本港的金融、航運、貿易中心的高效運作，連接全球，促進區域協同發展，以及發揮本港內聯外通優勢的戰略使命。

我現在請運輸署助理署長梁世豪介紹重點策略和其他比較仔細及長遠的建議。請梁助理署長，謝謝。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on February 5 to noon today (February 6), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 259 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

四個泳灘的水質被評為良好（一級），兩個為一般（二級）。

一級泳灘包括：



清水灣第二灣泳灘
黃金泳灘


深水灣泳灘
銀線灣泳灘




二級泳灘包括：



更生灣泳灘
麗都灣泳灘




比較上周公布的泳灘等級，更生灣泳灘由一級轉為二級。

環保署發言人說：「這些泳灘水質的轉變屬一般泳灘細菌水質的正常變動。」

環保署根據海水中的大腸桿菌水平，將泳灘水質評定為四個等級，包括良好（一級）、一般（二級）、欠佳（三級）及極差（四級）。泳灘等級是根據最近五次水樣本中大腸桿菌的幾何平均數而計算。

環保署發言人提醒市民，雖然泳灘的等級反映泳灘於一般情況下的水質，但泳灘的水質在大雨期間及過後或會暫時受到影響，泳客應該避免在風暴或大雨後三天內前往泳灘游泳。

環保署會在每個周末前公布各泳灘等級摘要。市民可於環保署網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach_chi）查閱根據最新數據評定的泳灘等級，或致電環保署泳灘水質熱線2511 6666查詢。市民亦可透過環保署的泳灘水質預測專題網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/BWQForecast），獲取各開放予公眾使用的泳灘的每日最新水質預測資訊。"
Grading of beach water quality released,2026-02-06 16:00,2026-02-06 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600494.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (February 6) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open year round for swimming.

  Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1) and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, Casam Beach has been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."
環保署利用創新聲學超材料減少噪音影響　提升工程效率（附圖）,2026-02-06 15:55,2026-02-06 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600274.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）今日（二月六日）表示，透過與路政署協作，將由塑膠回收再造成的創新聲學超材料應用於路政署在大埔運頭角里的一項道路重鋪工程，顯著減少工程噪音對鄰近居民的影響，成功將原先施工時間由三晚壓縮至一整天。

由於受日間的交通限制，一般道路維修工程往往需要在深夜或假日封路才可進行，而環保署亦會根據《噪音管制條例》發出建築噪音許可證，要求承建商在施工時必須盡量減低建築噪音對附近環境的影響。因此，道路工程的計劃和時間表須配合臨時交通措施，並受到手提破碎機等產生較大噪音的機動設備一般只能在平日午夜前才可運作的限制，令工程每天的規模變得相當有限。若以傳統方法施工，有關大埔運頭角里的道路重鋪工程需要三晚分階段完成。

在環保署、路政署、相關部門與承建商的協調下，大埔運頭角里的工程採用了先進的靜音電動破碎機及聲學超材料隔音罩，成功降低地面破碎工作噪音高達15分貝（A），大幅減低工程對鄰近居民及社區的影響，滿足居民生活及各種社區活動的需要。

該段約三百米長的道路於二月一日（星期日）從上午八時至晚上十時完成相關工作，包括刨去路面舊瀝青、打鑿、清理、重鋪及壓平等，施工一整天後於晚上十時重開有關路段，相比原先需要三晚完成，提升效率之餘亦減少連續數天影響居民作息。此外，聲學超材料隔音罩較傳統的隔音罩輕巧，易於移動，而其三面百葉的設計亦能確保良好的通風，保障工人的健康安全，並顯著改善施工環境。

工程期間，環保署一直與各持份者，包括當區區議員、附近居民、教會、老人院、警方等保持緊密聯繫，最後成功展示了一種多方共贏的模式，鄰近居民及社區團體均對這次道路重鋪工程反應正面。

在發展稠密的香港都市內進行道路維修工程面臨諸多挑戰，展望未來，環保署將繼續與工程項目倡議者攜手合作，在道路工程中更廣泛地應用這項創新技術，我們期望在未來可利用此技術把必要的晚間道路維修工程由多晚盡量壓縮至在假日一整天內完成，以期對市民的影響減至最低。"
EPD utilises innovative acoustic metamaterials to reduce noise impact and enhance project efficiency (with photos),2026-02-06 15:55,2026-02-06 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600279.htm,"The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (February 6) said that, together with the Highways Department (HyD), they have collaboratively implemented the innovative acoustic metamaterials made from recycled plastics in an HyD road resurfacing work on Wan Tau Kok Lane in Tai Po. The new innovative acoustic metamaterials significantly minimised noise impact on nearby residents and hence compressed the construction work period from the originally three nights to one whole day.

 Due to daytime traffic constraints, road maintenance works are generally conducted at night or on general holidays during road closure. The EPD will issue a construction noise permit under the Noise Control Ordinance, requiring contractors to minimise the construction noise impact on the surrounding environment during construction works. As a result, the planning and scheduling of road works must co-ordinate with temporary traffic arrangements and the limitation imposed by noisy powered mechanical equipment, such as handheld breakers that can generally only operate before midnight on weekdays, which further limit the daily project scale. Three nights are needed to complete the road resurfacing work in phases on Wan Tau Kok Lane by traditional construction methods.

 Through co-ordination among the EPD, the HyD, relevant departments and the contractor, the construction work on Wan Tau Kok Lane in Tai Po adopted advanced quiet electric handheld breakers and an acoustic metamaterial enclosure. This successfully reduced the noise levels from road breaking work by 15 decibels A, significantly minimising the impact of the project on nearby residents and the community, thus meeting the needs of residents' daily lives and various community activities.

 The construction work on the approximately 300-metre-long road was completed on February 1 (Sunday), from 8am to 10pm, encompassing processes such as removing the previous asphalt surface, breaking, cleansing, resurfacing and compacting, and the road section concerned was reopened at 10pm after a whole day of construction. This not only improved work efficiency compared to the original plan, which required three nights, but also minimised the impact on residents' lives over several days of construction. In addition, the acoustic metamaterial enclosure was lighter and more movable than the traditional enclosure, and the three-side louver design ensured good ventilation, enhancing workers' health and significantly improving the construction environment.

 Throughout this project, the EPD maintained close communication with stakeholders, including local district council members, nearby residents, churches, homes for the elderly, and the Police. This collaboration successfully demonstrated a win-win model, and local residents and community groups responded positively to this road resurfacing work.

 In Hong Kong's densely developed urban environment, roadworks present numerous challenges. Moving forward, the EPD will continue to collaborate with project proponents to widely apply the innovative technology in road projects, aiming to reduce necessary nighttime roadworks from several nights to one whole day on general holidays and minimise public impact."

大家好！我很高興出席由香港檢測和認證局舉辦的第三屆檢測認證人力發展嘉許計劃頒獎典禮。

香港檢測和認證局成立於二○○九年，跨越十五載。在此，我衷心感謝黃主席以及前任主席的卓越領導，局方成員及業界人士的共同努力，憑藉檢測認證業的專業誠信，鑄就了「香港檢測‧香港認證」這塊金漆招牌，多年來在支援香港的貿易、工業和其他服務業的發展擔當着重要角色。

邁向新一年，國家「十五五」規劃建議繼續明確支持香港建設國際創科中心。香港要緊密對接國家的發展戰略，因地制宜發展新質生產力，多管齊下實現香港新型工業化，檢測及認證正是創科產業鏈的重要一環。特區政府正積極構建科技產業體系，加上社會及業界對優質檢測及認證服務的需求與日俱增，香港的檢測及認證業有極大發展潛力。

人才是推動行業創新與持續發展的核心要素，檢測認證業也不例外。香港是全球唯一擁有五所百強大學的城市，更擁有全球頭四所最國際化大學；香港在世界人才排名也節節上升，兩年內上升共12位至世界第四，在亞太地區更位列榜首。這些數據不但是香港發展創科的底氣，亦是香港作為國際高端人才集聚高地的最佳證明。

科技創新、產業創新有賴檢測認證業的實質支撐，而業界能持續發展，離不開在座各位的專業和勤奮。今天榮獲檢測認證人力發展機構獎的機構，每一家都在人才培育方面樹立了典範。通過營造有利於人才成長的環境，不僅留住了核心力量，更激發了企業的創新與活力。而企業的蓬勃成長，又會持續創造更多優質崗位，吸引更多優秀人才加入業界，由此形成一個自我強化、良性循環的行業生態圈。這正是我們推動檢測認證業走向可持續發展的重要路徑。

在「一國兩制」的獨特優勢下，香港一直發揮着「超級聯絡人」和「超級增值人」的獨有角色。「深圳—香港—廣州」集群在《2025年全球創新指數》百強創新集群排名榮獲全球第一，彰顯大灣區在全球創新科技領域的領先地位及強大的協同創新動力。我鼓勵業界除了專注本地業務，亦要放眼灣區。我深信業界定能把握機遇，進一步鞏固香港作為區域內領先檢測認證中心的地位，協助企業將產品與服務推向全球市場，既豐富香港的產業生態，也為我們的經濟發展注入新動能。

最後，我衷心祝賀所有得獎機構和從業員，今天的嘉許，見證了你們的卓越成就。我希望業界繼續將香港的檢測認證事業推向新的高度，令香港內聯外通的獨特優勢，助力企業「引進來、走出去」，引領發展新質生產力，為構建高質量科技產業體系貢獻專業力量。謝謝！"

邁向新一年，國家「十五五」規劃建議繼續明確支持香港建設國際創科中心。香港要緊密對接國家的發展戰略，因地制宜發展新質生產力，多管齊下實現香港新型工業化，檢測及認證正是創科產業鏈的重要一環。特區政府正積極構建科技產業體系，加上社會及業界對優質檢測及認證服務的需求與日俱增，香港的檢測及認證業有極大發展潛力。

人才是推動行業創新與持續發展的核心要素，檢測認證業也不例外。香港是全球唯一擁有五所百強大學的城市，更擁有全球頭四所最國際化大學；香港在世界人才排名也節節上升，兩年內上升共12位至世界第四，在亞太地區更位列榜首。這些數據不但是香港發展創科的底氣，亦是香港作為國際高端人才集聚高地的最佳證明。

科技創新、產業創新有賴檢測認證業的實質支撐，而業界能持續發展，離不開在座各位的專業和勤奮。今天榮獲檢測認證人力發展機構獎的機構，每一家都在人才培育方面樹立了典範。通過營造有利於人才成長的環境，不僅留住了核心力量，更激發了企業的創新與活力。而企業的蓬勃成長，又會持續創造更多優質崗位，吸引更多優秀人才加入業界，由此形成一個自我強化、良性循環的行業生態圈。這正是我們推動檢測認證業走向可持續發展的重要路徑。

在「一國兩制」的獨特優勢下，香港一直發揮着「超級聯絡人」和「超級增值人」的獨有角色。「深圳—香港—廣州」集群在《2025年全球創新指數》百強創新集群排名榮獲全球第一，彰顯大灣區在全球創新科技領域的領先地位及強大的協同創新動力。我鼓勵業界除了專注本地業務，亦要放眼灣區。我深信業界定能把握機遇，進一步鞏固香港作為區域內領先檢測認證中心的地位，協助企業將產品與服務推向全球市場，既豐富香港的產業生態，也為我們的經濟發展注入新動能。

最後，我衷心祝賀所有得獎機構和從業員，今天的嘉許，見證了你們的卓越成就。我希望業界繼續將香港的檢測認證事業推向新的高度，令香港內聯外通的獨特優勢，助力企業「引進來、走出去」，引領發展新質生產力，為構建高質量科技產業體系貢獻專業力量。謝謝！"

The Board ordered the RSC to be fined $855,000 in total. Also, the RSC was ordered to pay $103,600 in total, being the costs of the Board and the Buildings Department (BD) for conducting the inquiries.

The Board's written decisions and orders issued on January 27 were published in the Gazette today (February 6). Details are available at the following links:

Case 2 : egazette.gld.gov.hk/pdf?type=egn&year=2026&volume=30&gno=06&notice_no=788&extra=0

The first case involved a fatal incident that occurred at a construction site in the West Kowloon Cultural District on January 24, 2022. A worker, while assisting in the repair of a crawler-mounted crane, was trapped between the boom of the crane and a bored pile casing in the vicinity. The worker sustained severe injuries and passed away on the same day. The RSC was prosecuted by the Labour Department (LD) for violation of the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance (FIUO) and the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Safety Management) Regulation.

Upon completion of the disciplinary inquiry, the Board ordered the RSC to be fined $619,000 and to pay a total of $48,800 being the costs of the Board and the BD for conducting the inquiry.

The second case involved a fatal incident that occurred at a construction site in Quarry Bay on January 13, 2020.

Government sells Tseung Kwan O site for purpose of electric vehicle fast charging station,2026-02-06 11:00,2026-02-06 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020500277.htm,"The Government announced today (February 6) the sale of Tseung Kwan O Town Lot No. 137 at No. 100 Po Hong Road, Tseung Kwan O, New Territories, for conversion to a fast charging station (FCS) for electric vehicles (EVs) through public tendering. The tender invitation will close on April 17, 2026.

A spokesperson for the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) said, ""To promote the green transformation of vehicles and to achieve zero vehicular emissions before 2050, the Government announced that there would be no new registration of fuel-propelled private cars (including hybrid vehicles) in 2035 or earlier. To cope with the rapid demand for charging facilities due to the increase in EVs, the Government has expedited the expansion of a high-quality charging network for different types of EVs (including commercial EVs). The Government also sold through open tender four petrol filling station (PFS) sites in Kowloon Bay, Fo Tan, Tai Po and Tsing Yi for FCS purposes. The area for retail use in the site of this sale is larger than that of a conventional PFS, allowing operators more flexibility to use such area to meet the needs of EV drivers. The Government will, subject to actual market needs, select suitable PFS sites for conversion into FCSs in a timely manner.""

Tseung Kwan O Town Lot No. 137 has a site area of 2 640 square metres and is designated for EV FCS purposes. Land sale documents, including the forms of tender, tender notice, conditions of sale and sale plan of the lot, are now available on the Lands Department (LandsD) website (www.landsd.gov.hk) for downloading. The sale plan is available for inspection by the public from today until the close of the tender. The sale plan in hard copy form may also be purchased from today until the close of the tender at the Survey and Mapping Office of the LandsD, 6/F, North Point Government Offices, 333 Java Road, North Point, Hong Kong. The particulars of the tender have also been gazetted today.

The spokesperson continued, ""In order to encourage owners of taxis and public light buses to expedite the adoption of electric taxis (e-taxis) and electric public light buses (e-PLBs), and by reference to the current arrangement of dedicated liquefied petroleum gas filling stations, a charging ceiling price mechanism will be established for e-taxis and e-PLBs at designated FCSs. The operators of designated FCSs cannot charge a price that is higher than the ceiling price to be announced by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on a monthly basis. The charging price for other EVs will be determined by the market. For details about the calculation of charging ceiling prices for e-taxis and e-PLBs, please refer to the EEB website (www.eeb.gov.hk/en/resources_publications/guidelines/index.html).""

Details of the charging ceiling price will be posted at designated FCSs when they are in operation and announced regularly on the EPD website (www.epd.gov.hk) to enable trade practitioners to monitor the changes in charging prices."

CHP reminds public not to consume raw oysters and observe food safety as norovirus-related food poisoning cases surged recently,2026-02-05 21:20,2026-02-05 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500813.htm,"In view of the recent surge in norovirus food poisoning cases related to consumption of raw oysters, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (February 5) urged the public to stay vigilant, maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times, and avoid consuming high-risk foods like raw oystersto prevent foodborne diseases.

Recent surge in norovirus-related food poisoning cases
--------------------------------------------

""Food poisoning cases have increased significantly in the recent month, rising from one case a week on average in late December last year to four cases a week on average in January. A total of 16 cases have been recorded in the first five days of February. Since January 18, the CHP has so far recorded 23 food poisoning cases, affecting 69 persons. Among which, 20 cases (87 per cent) were related to norovirus, affecting 57 persons. Epidemiological investigation showed that all cases were related to raw oyster consumption. The places of origin of the raw oysters include Korea, France, Ireland, Spain, etc. Among the affected persons, five persons were hospitalised for treatment. All are in stable condition. The CHP has notified the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) to follow up on the food poisoning cases,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""As oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater, pathogens can accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Raw and partially cooked oysters are considered a high-risk food. Persons who consume undercooked or contaminated oysters may contract food-borne diseases such as norovirus, hepatitis A virus or other bacteria. In view of the drastic increase in food poisoning cases related to consumption of raw oysters recently, members of the public, especially pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, shall stay vigilant and avoid consumption of raw oysters or partially cooked bivalve shellfish to prevent infection,"" Dr Tsui explained.

""In addition to food poisoning, norovirus can also cause acute gastroenteritis (AGE). The CHP reminded members of the public that AGE outbreaks have been steadily increasing since early January through press release last week. The latest data showed that, this year (as of February 4), a total of 29 AGE outbreaks in institutions and schools were recorded, involving a total of 206 persons. Laboratory testing indicated that over 60 per cent were caused by norovirus. Furthermore, according to the CHP's sentinel surveillance data, the AGE activity level has also shown an upward trend recently in Family Medicine Clinics, private medical practitioner clinics and child care centres/kindergartens. In addition, there have been increases in the norovirus activity in other popular travel destinations for Hong Kong citizens, including Japan and Korea. Members of the public should remain vigilant and maintain personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of being infected while travelling,"" Dr Tsui added.

New food poisoning clusters
------------------------------------

The CHP is investigating two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters affecting a total of four persons. The clusters involve one male and three females aged between 28 and 38. They developed abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and fever about 20 to 42 hours after having dinner at Odelice located at Shop No. 628, 6/F, New Town Plaza Phase 1, 18 Shatin Centre Street, Shatin on January 31 and February 1 respectively.

Three of the affected persons sought medical advice, and one of them required hospitalisation.A stool specimen from this patient tested positive for norovirus.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that raw oyster was the food item that the affected individuals had in common at the aforementioned restaurant. Officers of the FEHD (including personnel of the CFS and the Environmental Hygiene Branch) conducted an investigation and examined the handling processes and food hygiene at the restaurant. Food samples were also collected for testing. The CFS's field investigation revealed that the affected persons may have contracted food poisoning from consuming raw food. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to suspend serving the incriminated food items and to carry out cleaning and disinfection of the premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises.

The investigation of the CHP and the CFS is ongoing.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------------

Norovirus infection typically causes food poisoning and AGE with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, low-grade fever and malaise. The symptoms are usually self-limiting and most people will get better within one to three days.

In general, norovirus is more active in winter (around December to March). As norovirus is highly contagious, individuals may become infected after being exposed to even a small amount of norovirus. The virus can be transmitted through various means, such as eating contaminated food, contacting with the vomit or excreta of infected persons, and contacting with contaminated objects. In settings where people are staying close together such as schools, elderly homes etc., there is a possibility of a large-scale outbreak.

""As the Lunar New Year holiday is approaching, members of the public have more opportunities to have parties with food delivery services or hotpot. To prevent food poisoning, apart from maintaining personal hygiene, they should also consume thoroughly washed and cooked food. For shellfish, the shells should be well scrubbed and the internal organs be removed before consumption. To prevent AGE and norovirus infection, members of public should perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet. Wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds, then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer. Since alcohol is not effective in killing norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water,"" said Dr Tsui.

In addition, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children, are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and
Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet.

諾如病毒相關的食物中毒個案近期顯著上升　衞生防護中心提醒市民避免進食生蠔及注意食物安全,2026-02-05 20:50,2026-02-05 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500796.htm,"鑑於近期與進食生蠔相關的諾如病毒食物中毒個案顯著上升，衞生署衞生防護中心今日（二月五日）呼籲市民提高警覺，時刻保持個人、食物及環境衞生，避免進食生蠔等高風險食物，預防經由食物傳播的疾病。

諾如病毒食物中毒個案近期顯著增加
——————————————

衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「近月錄得的食物中毒個案顯著增加，由去年十二月底每周錄得平均一宗個案，上升至上月每周平均四宗，本月首五天更急增至16宗個案。自一月十八日至今，中心已錄得23宗食物中毒個案（共影響69人），當中20宗（87%）與諾如病毒相關（共影響57人）。流行病學調查發現全部個案與食用生蠔有關。生蠔的產地包括韓國、法國、愛爾蘭、西班牙等。受影響人士當中，有五人須留院治理，全部情況穩定。中心已通知食物環境衞生署食物安全中心跟進食物中毒個案。」

徐樂堅醫生解釋：「由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有病原體，這些物質便會在蠔的體內積聚。生或未徹底煮熟的蠔是高風險食物，進食受污染及未經煮熟的蠔，可能感染經由食物傳染的疾病，例如諾如病毒、甲型肝炎病毒或其他細菌。鑑於近日與進食生蠔相關的食物中毒個案大幅上升，市民應提高警覺，盡量避免進食生蠔或未徹底煮熟的雙殼類海產，尤其是孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士及肝病患者，以預防受到感染。」

徐樂堅醫生續說：「除了食物中毒，諾如病毒亦是引致急性腸胃炎的主要原因之一。衞生防護中心上星期已透過新聞公報，提醒市民急性腸胃炎爆發個案數字自一月初起持續上升。最新數據顯示，今年（截至二月四日）暫時已錄得29宗院舍和學校的急性腸胃炎爆發個案，涉及206人。實驗室的檢測顯示超過六成是諾如病毒引致。此外，根據中心的傳染病定點監測數據，家庭醫學門診、私家醫生診所及幼兒中心／幼稚園的急性腸胃炎活躍程度近期亦呈上升趨勢。此外，其他香港人的旅遊熱點近日的諾如病毒活躍程度亦持續上升，包括日本及韓國。市民外遊時要提高警覺，注意個人、環境及食物衞生，以減低受感染的風險。」

新增食物中毒個案群組
——————————

中心今日正調查兩宗有流行病學關連的食物中毒個案群組，共涉及四人。涉及一男三女，年齡介乎28至38歲。他們分別於一月三十一日及二月一日在沙田新城市廣場一期六樓628號鋪Odelice晚膳，約20至42小時後出現腹痛、噁心、嘔吐、腹瀉和發燒等病徵。

其中三人已求醫，一人須留院治理，其糞便樣本經化驗後，證實對諾如病毒呈陽性反應。全部受影響人士目前情況穩定。

初步調查顯示，受影響人士於上述食肆進食的共同食物為生蠔。食物環境衞生署人員（包括食物安全中心和環境衞生部人員）已到涉事餐廳調查，檢視食物處理流程和衞生，並抽取食物樣本作化驗。食物安全中心現場調查發現受影響人士可能進食了生的食物引致食物中毒。食物安全中心已即時指示有關餐廳暫停供應涉事食物、清潔消毒處所，及向餐廳員工提供食物安全和環境衞生教育。

衞生防護中心及食物安全中心的調查仍然繼續。

市民應採取預防措施
—————————

諾如病毒常引致食物中毒及急性腸胃炎，症狀包括噁心、嘔吐、腹瀉、腹痛、輕微發燒及不適。大部分患者一般會自行痊癒，症狀通常在一至三天內有所改善。

一般來說，諾如病毒在冬天（約十二月至三月期間）較為活躍。由於病毒具高度傳染性，受影響人士即使接觸少量病毒，亦有機會受感染。病毒可透過進食受污染的食物、接觸受感染人士的嘔吐物或排泄物，及接觸受污染的物件等不同途徑傳播，在人多聚集的地方，如學校、安老院舍等，有機會導致大規模爆發。

徐樂堅醫生說：「農曆新年假期將至，市民較多機會舉行派對安排食物到會或火鍋，要預防食物中毒，除了注意個人衞生，所有食物亦必須徹底清潔並煮熟後方可食用；處理貝類海產時，須洗淨外殼並去除內臟，才可進食。要預防急性腸胃炎及諾如病毒感染，必須經常保持雙手清潔，尤其在處理食物或進食前及如廁後。洗手時應以梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手。」

此外，市民應經常保持個人、食物及環境衞生。在外進食時，應注意以下要點：


避免進食生的海產；
小心選擇冷盤，包括自助餐的刺身、壽司及生蠔；
如需製作以未經徹底煮熟的蛋為用料的菜式時，應選用經巴士德消毒的蛋、蛋製品或蛋粉；
光顧可靠及有牌照的食肆；

"​食安中心指示業界暫停進口及在港出售韓國Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd.供應的生蠔",2026-02-05 20:20,2026-02-05 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500749.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（食安中心）今日（二月五日）指示業界暫停進口韓國Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd.供應的生蠔。業界如持有受影響產品，應立即停止使用或出售。

食安中心發言人說：「食安中心近日接獲衞生署衞生防護中心有關食物中毒個案的通報後，隨即派員在食肆和供應商層面跟進調查，發現個案所涉人士曾進食由韓國Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd.供應的生蠔。為審慎起見，食安中心即時指示業界暫停進口及在港出售由韓國Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd.供應的生蠔。」

食安中心已要求有關供應商及食肆即時停止供應和出售受影響生蠔，並正追查有關產品的分銷情況。業界如持有有關產品，亦應立即停止使用或出售。

發言人指出，由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水的方式進食，如果養殖或採蠔的水域水質帶有病原體，這些物質便會在蠔的體內積聚。生或未徹底煮熟的蠔是高風險食物，孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士和肝病患者等容易受感染的人士，應避免進食生蠔。

食安中心已通知韓國當局有關事宜，亦會知會本地業界，並繼續跟進事件及採取適當行動，以保障食物安全和市民健康。調查仍然繼續。"

The trade should stop using or selling the affected product immediately should they possess it.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS, upon recent notification by the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health of food poisoning cases, conducted follow-up investigations at both the restaurant and supplier levels, and found that the cases involved consumption of raw oysters supplied by Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd. from Korea. For the sake of prudence, the CFS has immediately instructed the trade to suspend the import into and sale within Hong Kong of raw oysters supplied by Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd. from Korea.""

The CFS has also instructed the supplier and restaurants concerned to stop supplying and selling the affected raw oysters immediately, and is tracing the distribution of the product concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the product concerned immediately should they possess it.

The spokesman pointed out that as oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater, pathogens can accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Raw or partially cooked oysters are high-risk foods. Susceptible groups, such as pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, should avoid eating raw oysters.

The CFS has informed the Korean authorities of the matter and will also notify the local trade. It will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. An investigation is ongoing."

Health Bureau welcomes Ombudsman's direct investigation operation report,2026-02-05 18:28,2026-02-05 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500629.htm,"The Health Bureau (HHB) welcomed the recommendations made to the Government and the Department of Health (DH) in the Office of The Ombudsman (Ombudsman)'s direct investigation operation report entitled ""Effectiveness of Administrative Support Provided for Complaint Handling by Secretariat of Medical Council of Hong Kong under Department of Health, and Department of Health's Regulatory Role"" (Report) released today (February 5). The HHB expressed gratitude to the Ombudsman for putting forward a series of pertinent and useful observations and views on strengthening the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) as the statutory regulatory body for the medical profession. With reference to the Ombudsman's views and the Report, the HHB will formulate detailed proposals to amend the Medical Registration Ordinance (MRO), with a view to enabling the MCHK and its Secretariat to discharge their duties of upholding doctors' professional conduct and continuously enhancing medical professional standards more effectively under the principle of professional autonomy.

Since the Ombudsman announced the launch of a full investigation on November 5 last year, the HHB and the DH have been fully co-operating with the Ombudsman's investigation. Although the MCHK as a statutory professional regulatory body fell outside the scope of the Ombudsman's investigation, the HHB and the DH have, in respect of matters covered by the investigation, liaised and communicated with the MCHK, and provided relevant information to the Ombudsman to facilitate the investigation and formulation of improvement measures. Many of the measures recommended in the Report on the support provided by the DH and the Secretariat of the MCHK for the complaint handling mechanism of the MCHK, as well as the Ombudsman's series of observations and views on the current regulatory framework for the medical profession, align with the HHB's overarching directions in reviewing the MRO, namely to ensure that the legislation for healthcare professions keeps pace with the times, meets societal needs and the public interest, and to enable the MCHK to discharge its various statutory functions more effectively, including its function in handling complaints.

Meanwhile, in response to the request made by the Secretary for Health in October last year, the MCHK has completed its review on improving the complaint handling mechanism and submitted a report and supplementary information to the HHB. In January this year, the HHB commenced a series of consultations on amending the MRO, meeting with patient groups, the two local medical schools, the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, the Hong Kong Medical Association and other medical professional bodies. The HHB also visited the MCHK yesterday(February 4) to exchange views with members on the amendment to the MRO. The HHB will further take into account the Ombudsman's Report and the views of various stakeholders, and will formulate proposals to amend the MRO having regard to the operational needs of the MCHK. The HHB will also propose measures to strengthen the functions of the Secretariat of the MCHK under the DH. The HHB will brief the Panel on Health Services of the Legislative Council (LegCo) shortly on the proposed directions and enhancement proposals for the MRO, with a target of introducing an amendment bill into the LegCo in the first half of this year."
入境處聯同內地執法機關搗破跨境偽證集團（附圖）,2026-02-05 18:14,2026-02-05 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500509.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）聯同廣東省公安廳出入境管理總隊及珠海市公安出入境管理部門，展開跨境聯合行動，成功搗破一個跨境偽證集團，共拘捕119人並檢獲大量偽證製造設備及偽造證件。

內地執法機關於去年八月發現涉及組織內地居民來港從事非法工作的重要線索。入境處迅速與內地執法機關展開深入調查，成功鎖定一個專門招攬內地居民來港從事非法工作的跨境偽證集團。該集團於內地設置製作偽證據點，並將僞造香港身份證寄送至內地不同城巿，然後由集團成員將偽證運送至香港。之後，再由集團在港主腦將這些偽證分發予非法勞工，並安排宿舍及協助他們尋找工作。

入境處調查人員於二○二五年十月至二○二六年一月展開代號「銳鋒」的執法行動，突擊搜查38個目標地點，包括16個住宅單位以及22個工作地點。在行動中成功拘捕102人，年齡介乎32至74歲，當中包括兩名為主腦及骨幹人員的集團成員、83名懷疑非法勞工及涉案人士，以及17名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。該兩名集團成員分別為一名39歲內地居民及一名57歲香港居民。而83名被捕的懷疑非法勞工及涉案人士為23男60女，包括一名香港居民以及82名內地居民，年齡介乎32至70歲。此外，入境處調查人員在行動中檢獲40張偽造香港身份證及24張偽造香港身份證副本。入境處相信透過是次大規模聯合行動，已成功瓦解該跨境偽證集團。目前相關調查仍在進行中，入境處不排除將有更多涉案人士被拘捕。

內地方面，執法機關成功搗破兩個製作偽證據點，共拘捕17名集團骨幹成員，並檢獲三台偽證製造設備。

入境處發言人說：「根據現行香港法例，任何人士如使用或管有偽造香港身份證乃屬違法，一經定罪，最高罰款為十萬元及監禁十年。任何人無合法權限或合理辯解而將身份證轉讓給他人即屬犯罪，一經定罪，最高罰款為十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人警告：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。而根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

Cross-boundary forgery syndicate smashed by Immigration Department and Mainland authorities (with photos),2026-02-05 18:14,2026-02-05 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500511.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a cross-boundary joint operation with the Exit and Entry Administration Corps of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department and the Immigration Authority of Zhuhai Municipal Public Security Bureau and successfully neutralised a cross-boundary forgery syndicate, resulting in the arrest of a total of 119 persons and the seizure of a large amount of forgery equipment and forged documents.

  In August last year, the Mainland authorities unearthed crucial intelligence related to a syndicate arranging Mainlanders to take up illegal employment in Hong Kong. The ImmD immediately collaborated with the Mainland authorities to conduct an in-depth investigation and successfully identified a cross-boundary forgery syndicate specialising in recruiting Mainlanders to take up illegal employment in Hong Kong. The syndicate had set up forgery workshops on the Mainland for producing forged documents and shipped the forged Hong Kong identity cards to different cities of the Mainland. Syndicate members would transport the forged Hong Kong identity cards into Hong Kong. The syndicate mastermind in Hong Kong would then distribute the forged Hong Kong identity cards to the illegal workers, provide them with accommodation and assist them in seeking employment.

  ImmD investigators launched an operation code-named ""Sharpspear"" from October 2025 to January 2026. They raided a total of 38 premises, including 16 residential premises and 22 working places, and arrested a total of 102 persons, including two syndicate members comprising a mastermind and a core member, 83 suspected illegal workers and persons involved in the case and 17 suspected employers, aged 32 to 74. The two syndicate members are one Mainland resident aged 39 and one Hong Kong resident aged 57. The 83 arrested suspected illegal workers and persons involved in the case comprise 23 men and 60 women, consisting of one Hong Kong resident and 82 Mainlanders, aged 32 to 70. ImmD investigators also seized 40 forged Hong Kong identity cards and 24 copies of forged Hong Kong identity cards. Through this large-scale joint operation, the cross-boundary forgery syndicate has been neutralised. The investigation is still ongoing, and more persons involved in the case may be arrested.

  On the Mainland side, two forgery workshops were smashed and a total of 17 syndicate core members were arrested, and three pieces of forgery equipment were seized.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Under the laws of Hong Kong, anyone who uses or possesses a forged identity card commits an offence. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, a maximum penalty of a fine of $100,000 and 10 years' imprisonment. Any person who without lawful authority or reasonable excuse transfers to another person a Hong Kong identity card commits an offence. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, a maximum penalty of a fine of $100,000 and 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman warned, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties. As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

自公署於去年十一月五日宣布進行全面調查以來，醫衞局及衞生署一直全面配合公署調查，雖然醫委會作為法定專業規管機構在公署調查範圍之外，但局方和署方均就調查所涉及的事宜與醫委會進行了解和溝通，並向公署提供相關資料以助調查及提出改善措施。主動調查行動報告就衞生署及醫委會秘書處支援醫委會處理投訴機制作出不少建議措施，以及公署就現行醫療專業規管制度提出的一系列觀察及意見，均與醫衞局檢討《條例》確保醫護專業法例與時並進，符合社會需要和公眾利益，以優化醫委會令其能更有效履行各項法定職能，包括處理申訴職能的大方向吻合。

與此同時，因應醫衞局局長去年十月提出的要求，醫委會已就完善投訴處理機制完成檢討並向醫衞局提交報告及𥙷充資料。醫衞局於今年一月就修訂《條例》開展一系列的諮詢，會見病人組織、兩所本地醫學院、香港醫學專科學院、香港醫學會及其他醫學界的專業團體，昨日（二月四日）亦到訪醫委會就修訂《條例》與委員進行交流。醫衞局將進一步參考公署報告及各持份者的建議，並按醫委會的運作需要制訂修訂《條例》建議，亦會提出措施強化衞生署醫委會秘書處職能。醫衞局稍後會向立法會衞生事務委員會介紹建議方向和完善《條例》方案，目標在今年上半年向立法會提交《條例》修訂草案。"

衞生署回應申訴專員公署主動調查行動報告,2026-02-05 17:35,2026-02-05 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500598.htm,"就申訴專員公署（公署）今日（二月五日）發表「衞生署轄下香港醫務委員會（醫委會）秘書處就投訴處理所提供的支援及成效、衞生署的相關監管」的主動調查行動報告，衞生署回應如下：

政府感謝公署對醫委會工作的關注及提出寶貴意見，並接納和會積極跟進公署的建議，致力協助醫委會優化投訴處理機制，提升工作效率，改善服務質素。

醫委會是根據香港法例第161章《醫生註冊條例》（《條例》）成立的法定機構，按法例賦予的權力處理與醫生專業發展相關的事宜，維持醫療水平及保障病人。一向以來，衞生署向醫委會提供秘書處人手或其他資源，以支援醫委會按照《條例》及相關附屬法例履行職責。

公署在報告中對醫委會現行投訴處理機制及進度表示關注，並提出多項改善建議，當中部份涉及修訂現行法例。就此，醫務衞生局早前已表示會因應醫委會提交的檢討報告及其運作需要而提出修訂《條例》，以確保制度與時並進，符合社會需求。

至於公署提出的其他涉及醫委會及其秘書處行政安排的建議，衞生署會邀請醫委會參考公署的建議，以檢視及完善現有安排。就秘書處的整體行政支援績效、人手及資源需求、以及人事表現管理等方面，衞生署日後會進一步加強與醫委會溝通，以提升秘書處的工作效率。

衞生署強調，香港醫生專業奉行專業自主的原則。政府將透過修訂法例，以及其他行政和資源上的支援，協助醫委會履行其法定職責，進一步提升醫生的專業水平和道德操守，以維護公眾及病人的利益。"
DH responds to Ombudsman's direct investigation operation report,2026-02-05 17:35,2026-02-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500599.htm,"​Regarding the report on the direct investigation operation released by the Office of The Ombudsman today (February 5) on the ""effectiveness of administrative support provided for complaint handling by Secretariat of Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK) under Department of Health (DH), and DH's regulatory role"", the DH responds as follows:

The Government appreciates the Ombudsman's attention to the work of the MCHK and its valuable suggestions. The Government accepts and will actively follow up on the recommendations in the report, striving to assist the MCHK in optimising its complaint-handling mechanism, enhancing operational efficiency, and improving service quality.

The MCHK is a statutory body established under the Medical Registration Ordinance (MRO) (Cap. 161) to handle matters relating to the professional development of medical practitioners, maintain healthcare standards and protect patients in accordance with the powers conferred by legislation. The DH has consistently provided the MCHK with Secretariat staff or other resources to support the MCHK in fulfilling its duties under the MRO and relevant subsidiary legislation.

In its report, the Ombudsman expressed concerns about the MCHK's current mechanism and the progress in complaint handling, and put forward a number of recommendations for improvement, some of which will involve legislative amendments. In this regard, the Health Bureau had previously indicated that it would propose amendments to the MRO in response to the report submitted by the MCHK and its operational needs in order to ensure that the mechanism keeps pace with the times and meets the needs of society.

Regarding other recommendations made by the Ombudsman concerning the administrative arrangements of the MCHK and its Secretariat, the DH will invite the MCHK to review and refine the existing arrangements based on the Ombudsman's recommendations. Furthermore, the DH will strengthen communication with the MCHK regarding the Secretariat's overall performance of administrative support, staffing and resource requirements, as well as performance management of Secretariat staff to enhance the Secretariat's operational efficiency.

The DH stressed that the medical professioninHong Konghave all along upheld the principle of professional autonomy. The Government will assist the MCHK in discharging its statutory duties through legislative amendments, and other administrative and resource support, thereby further enhancing the professional standards and conduct of doctors to safeguard the interests of public and patients."

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-05 17:30,2026-02-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500558.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 5), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Sixth-term Commission on Poverty convenes fifth meeting,2026-02-05 17:30,2026-02-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/05/P2026020500488.htm,"The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, chaired the fifth meeting of the sixth-term Commission on Poverty (CoP) this afternoon (February 5).

At the meeting, members were briefed by a university research team on the review results of Targeted Poverty Alleviation Schemes. Members were pleased to note that the Strive and Rise Programme, the Pilot Programme on Community Living Room, and the School-based After School Care Service Scheme have achieved their key performance indicators, with certain indicators exceeding expectations. This reflects the schemes' positive impact on service beneficiaries' living standards and personal development, and further affirms the direction of the strategy of targeted poverty alleviation and its effectiveness. The review findings will be incorporated into the proposed Report on Impact of Targeted Poverty Alleviation Strategy in Hong Kong.

Members also noted that the Report will quantify at a macro level the social value transferred to households that benefit from regular housing, health, education, and welfare measures. Such an analysis would reflect in a more comprehensive manner the Government's efforts and effectiveness in alleviating poverty.

The Government will prepare the Report according to the timetable and consult the CoP with a view to releasing it in mid-2026."
