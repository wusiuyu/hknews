勞工處發言人今日（八月六日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-08-06 11:46,2025-08-06 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600325.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 6) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

CE: Promoting multifaceted co-operation between Hong Kong and Macao to leverage collaborative strength of two Special Administrative Regions (with photos),2025-08-05 19:30,2025-08-05 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500893.htm,"The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, led representatives of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government to visit Macao today (August 5), where he met with the Chief Executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region, Mr Sam Hou-fai, and visited local infrastructure facilities.Representatives of the HKSAR Government included the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan; the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai; the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau; the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan; and the Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Ms Carol Yip.

Mr Lee met with Mr Sam for an in-depth discussion on promoting Hong Kong's co-operation with Macao on various fronts and the high-quality development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Mr Lee said he is pleased to meet Mr Sam again following Mr Sam's earlier visit to Hong Kong. He said that establishing the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin demonstrates the key strategic planning to enrich the practice of ""one country, two systems"", benefitting Macao's long-term prosperity and stability and integration into the overall national development. Noting that Hong Kong and Macao are the country's special administrative regions that enjoy distinctive advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Mr Lee said that the two cities enjoy close geographical ties, with frequent people-to-people and cultural exchanges, alongside solid economic and trade relations, while Hong Kong and Macao have been working closely in such areas as economy, cross-boundary infrastructure, tourism and culture.

Mr Lee pointed out that Hong Kong and Macao are both integral parts of the GBA and will continue to promote the development of the GBA together. By firmly upholding the principle of ""one country"" and leveraging the benefits of ""two systems"", Hong Kong and Macao will achieve complementarity and jointly seize development opportunities, and continue to strengthen co-operation between the two cities, contributing to the promotion of the high-quality development of the GBA.

Mr Lee and the officials also visited the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin. They first toured the Traditional Chinese Medicine Cultural Experience Center of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Science and Technology Industrial Park of Cooperation between Guangdong and Macao to learn about the integration of traditional Chinese medicine and the cultural tourism industry. They then visited the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin Planning Exhibition Hall, which features over 600 exhibits on new products and technologies. Mr Lee discussed and exchanged views with attending officials on the management, construction, development models and achievements of the Cooperation Zone.

Mr Lee and the officials returned to Hong Kong in the afternoon."

Government departments drive all-out efforts to cope with rainstorm impacts,2025-08-05 18:22,2025-08-05 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500853.htm,"A Government spokesman said today (August 5) that the persistent rainstorm has caused flooding and landslides across extensive areas of Hong Kong. Relevant government departments have responded promptly, making every effort to minimise the impacts of the heavy rain.

Since late last night (August 4), the Government's Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre has been operating continuously, with directorate officers from relevant departments closely monitoring the situation across Hong Kong in real time. They have been swiftly co-ordinating responses and actions, remaining on high alert and efficiently orchestrating all government departments to fully mobilise in addressing flooding, landslides, fallen trees, and road blockages, striving to minimise the impact of adverse weather on the public.

The Drainage Services Department (DSD) has been maintaining close liaison with the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and making preparations. The DSD activated the Emergency Control Centre at 10.35pm last night and deployed emergency response teams to proactively inspect flooding-prone locations, including Chai Wan and Wong Tai Sin. Various locations experienced flooding due to the heavy rainfall. The DSD mobilised a total of 180 emergency response teams, involving about 620 personnel and several powerful pumping robots, including three Mobile Powerful Pumping Robots, and worked closely with other works departments to handle flooding cases and clear drainage channels across the territory. As of 3pm today, 29 flooding cases have been confirmed, with 24 of them resolved, including the case at Queen Mary Hospital. The affected roads have mostly resumed normal operation. The DSD emergency response teams are working at full capacity to handle the remaining flooding cases.

The Emergency Control Centre of the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO) was activated soon after the HKO issued a landslip warning. As of 2.30pm today, a total of 15 reports of landslides were received in areas including Sai Kung, Tai Po, Kwai Chung, Lantau, Southern, Mid-levels, Wan Chai, Sha Tin and Peng Chau. The GEO has arranged inspections of the reported landslide locations and contacted relevant departments for necessary emergency slope works.

During rainstorm warnings, the Fire Services Department, by 4pm today, handled a total of 42 reports of people trapped in lifts, 175 reports from automatic fire alarm systems, 36 reports of fallen trees, seven reports of landslides, and 69 reports of flooding incidents. Among these, assistance was provided to six people to safe places in two of the flooding incidents.

The Urban and New Territories Emergency Control Centres of the Highways Department were activated after the Red Rainstorm Warning Signal was in force last night to co-ordinate the handling of road emergencies, including clearing debris at road sections in Southern District, Tai Po and Sai Kung where landslides occurred, with the goal of reopening at least one traffic lane for public use as soon as possible while continuing to follow up urgent slope repair works; and quickly clearing roadside gullies blocked by muddy water and debris in various districts where flooding occurred, with affected road sections reopened immediately afterwards.

The Emergency Transport Coordination Centre (ETCC) of the Transport Department (TD) continues to operate round the clock and escalated its operational level when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is in force to closely monitor the traffic and transport conditions of important routes including trunk roads, tunnels and bridges across the territory. The ETCC expedites assessment of the impact of the rainstorm on traffic and maintains close liaison with relevant departments and public transport operators to steer and co-ordinate public transport services to meet passenger demand.

The TD conducts ongoing review of various trunk roads and link roads in locations without alternatives, aiming to promptly identify locations affected by flooding or obstructed by objects requiring higher priority clearance. This facilitates the clearance work of departments concerned, with a view to reopening blocked roads and resuming public transport services, thereby minimising impact on the public's commute.

During the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, frontline police officers remained steadfast in assisting members of the public affected by the heavy rain across multiple districts. They also handled vehicles stranded due to flooding and cleared blocked drains in rural areas to ensure smooth traffic flow.

The Government urges members of the public to stay away from slopes as the landslip warning is still in force. Drivers should avoid driving in hilly areas or parking their vehicles below slopes. Residents living close to slopes should stay in rooms furthest from the slopes or on high floors if possible. When a notification to evacuate is received, members of the public should follow rescuers' instructions and move immediately to a safe shelter. If they witness a landslide, they should leave immediately and call the Police when safe to do so.

The Home Affairs Department (HAD) has so far opened a total of 15 temporary shelters for people in need. The Emergency Co-ordination Centre of the HAD has been in operation since the early hours to co-ordinate work and information dissemination in 18 districts as well as prompt follow-up on various incident reports. District Offices have immediately initiated relevant response measures, including co-ordinating with other departments and organisations to provide support. They have also mobilised District Council members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to pay attention to safety.

The Housing Department (HD) Communication Centre was promptly activated to handle emergencies after the Red Rainstorm Warning Signal was in force. As of 4pm, the Centre received 49 enquiries from residents, which were immediately relayed to relevant teams for follow-up to provide swift assistance. This included a case of temporary power failure in a block of Kwai Shing West Estate, where power supply has since been resumed after emergency repair. Frontline staff of the HD also remained dedicated to their duties, taking precautionary measures against the heavy rain and stepping up patrols. The overall operation of housing estate facilities remained unaffected. The HD will continue to work with other departments to ensure the safety of public housing residents.

Hong Kong's weather conditions remain unstable. The Government reminds the public to stay updated on the latest weather and traffic reports. Government departments will continue to make every effort to carry out coping measures and relief work, while Care Teams will provide ongoing support to members of the public in need."

A male passenger, aged 20, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds concealed inside vacuum-sealed bags in his check-in suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (August 6).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案,2025-08-05 17:30,2025-08-05 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500709.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月五日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱個案，屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。除基孔肯雅熱外，市民亦需提防登革熱，兩者同樣可由本地普遍存在的白紋伊蚊傳播。今年登革熱持續在眾多鄰近旅遊地點流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過20 000宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得308宗本地感染病例。

 市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）已加強確診病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪地點的防蚊滅蚊工作。同時，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today,2025-08-05 17:30,2025-08-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500708.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 5) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the recent CF case. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of one CF case has been recorded in Hong Kong this year, which is an imported case. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Apart from CF, members of the public should also stay vigilant against dengue fever (DF), as both can be transmitted by the Aedes albopictus, which is ubiquitous in Hong Kong. DF continues to be prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations this year. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases. Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 308 locally infected cases so far this year.

If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has intensified anti-mosquito measures at the residence of the confirmed patient and the locations visited after the onset of illness. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces as well as removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The latest gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas are available on the department website at:www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Ovitrap_Index_Update.html#.

The CHP will collaborate with the FEHD to hold an online live seminar on itsFacebook pagetonight from 8pm to 8.30pm, to provide information and health advice on preventing mosquito bites and controlling mosquito breeding, as well as addressing related public enquiries. Members of the public are welcome to attend.

​政府各部門全力應對暴雨對本港造成的影響,2025-08-05 17:16,2025-08-05 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500721.htm,"政府發言人今日（八月五日）表示，本港廣泛地區持續受到暴雨影響，多區出現水浸及山泥傾瀉，各相關部門迅速應對，全力將暴雨影響減至最低。

自昨晚（八月四日）深夜起，政府的緊急事故監察及支援中心一直持續運作，由各相關部門的首長級人員實時密切監察全港市面的情況，迅速作出協調應變及行動，嚴陣以待並高效統籌協調各政府部門全力出動，處理水浸、山泥傾瀉、塌樹和道路阻塞等情況，致力減低惡劣天氣對市民的影響。

渠務署一直與天文台保持密切聯繫並作好準備，於昨晚十時三十五分啓動緊急事故控制中心，並派出緊急應變隊伍主動巡查過去容易水浸的地點，包括柴灣及黃大仙。由於持續暴雨，多個地方出現水浸，渠務署共派出180隊緊急應變隊伍，動用約620人及多部強力排水機械人，包括三部「龍吸水」，與其他政府工務部門緊密合作，在全港各區處理水浸個案及清理渠道。至今日下午三時，已確認29個水浸個案，並完成處理其中24個個案及清除水浸，當中包括瑪麗醫院的水浸個案，受水浸影響的道路亦得以大致回復正常運作。渠務署緊急應變隊伍正全力處理餘下地點的水浸個案。

土力工程處亦於天文台發出山泥傾瀉警告後，迅速啓動緊急控制中心。截至今日下午二時三十分，土力工程處接獲共15宗位於西貢、大埔、葵涌、大嶼山、南區、半山、灣仔、沙田及坪洲等地區的山泥傾瀉報告；已安排人員視察山泥傾瀉事故地點，並已聯絡相關部門安排所需的斜坡緊急工程。

在暴雨警告信號期間，消防處截至今日下午四時共處理了42宗有人被困升降機報告、175宗自動報火警系統報告、36宗樹木倒塌報告、七宗山泥傾瀉報告，以及69宗水浸事故報告；在其中兩宗水浸事故共協助了六名市民到安全地方。

路政署轄下的市區和新界緊急控制中心在昨晚紅色暴雨警告信號生效後啓動，協調處理緊急道路事故的工作，包括在南區、大埔和西貢等發生山泥傾瀉的路段清理山泥，以盡快開通最少一條行車線予公眾使用，並繼續跟進斜坡緊急復修工作；以及在各區出現水浸的路段，迅速清理受泥水和雜物造成淤塞的路旁集水溝後，即時重開受影響路段。

運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心在黑色暴雨警告信號生效期間繼續24小時運作，並提升級別，密切監察全港各區主要幹道、隧道和橋樑等重要道路的交通及運輸情況。協調中心加快評估暴雨對交通造成的影響，並與相關部門和公共運輸服務營辦商緊密溝通，督導和協調公共運輸服務，應對乘客需求。署方持續檢視各主要幹道及沒有替代路線地點的連接道路清單，務求快捷分辨出須優先清理水浸和路面障礙物的位置，便利相關部門執行清理工作，盡快開通阻塞道路，盡早全面恢復公交服務，將對市民出行的影響減至最低。

在黑色暴雨警告信號生效期間，前線警務人員堅守崗位，在多區協助受暴雨影響的居民，處理因水浸被困的車輛和清理鄉郊淤塞的渠口，疏導交通。

政府呼籲市民，山泥傾瀉警告現時仍然生效，市民應遠離斜坡；駕駛人士亦應避免駛經山區或在斜坡下停泊車輛。居住在靠近斜坡地方的市民，應盡量留在遠離斜坡的房間，並盡量逗留在較高的樓層。如市民收到通知需要疏散，應配合救援人員的指示，即時撤離到安全地方暫避。如市民發現所處地點附近發生山泥傾瀉，應立即離開，並在安全的情況下報警。

此外，民政事務總署至現時合共開放了15個臨時庇護中心，供有需要市民入住。民政事務總署緊急事故協調中心已由凌晨時分開始運作，協調各區工作及傳遞信息，迅速跟進各項緊急事故報告。各區民政事務處亦已啓動相關應對工作，包括協調其他部門和機構作出支援，並動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊向區內易受水浸影響的居民發放最新的天氣資訊，提醒他們注意安全。

房屋署聯絡中心於紅色暴雨警告信號發出後迅速啓動，處理突發事故。截至今日下午四時，聯絡中心收到49宗住戶查詢，已即時通知相關組別跟進處理，迅速提供協助。其中葵盛西邨一座大廈短暫停電的個案，經搶修後現時電力供應已恢復。房屋署前線同事亦緊守崗位，作出應對暴雨防範措施，加強巡查，各屋邨設施整體運作未受影響。房屋署會繼續與各部門協作，保障公共屋邨居民的安全。

現時本港天氣仍然不穩定，政府提醒市民留意最新天氣消息及交通情況報告。政府各部門人員會繼續全力進行應對及善後工作，而關愛隊亦會繼續向有需要市民提供支援。"
