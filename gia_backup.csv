一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-08-09 19:40,2025-08-09 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900692.htm,"​一名入境旅客因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（八月九日）在粉嶺裁判法院被判處監禁八星期及罰款一千五百元。

海關人員於八月八日在落馬洲支線管制站截查一名五十八歲抵港女旅客，在她身上共檢獲九百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約四千元，應課稅值約三千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-08-09 19:40,2025-08-09 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900691.htm,"An incoming passenger was sentenced to eight weeks' imprisonment and fined $1,500 at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (August 9) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted an incoming female passenger, aged 58, at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on August 8. A total of 981 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $4,000 and a duty potential of about $3,000 were seized. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案（附圖）,2025-08-09 18:30,2025-08-09 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900582.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月九日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得五宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案，以及一宗可能個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

鑑於香港出現多宗輸入個案，存在經蚊子引致二代本地傳播的風險。衞生防護中心今日將再發信提醒醫生，為臨床症狀符合基孔肯雅熱的患者安排檢測，不論其旅遊史。根據臨床判斷，亦應考慮為有任何基孔肯雅熱症狀並有到訪受影響地區旅遊史的患者進行檢測。中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測，以確保及早診斷。

衞生署已加強對不同群組有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作。中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並向旅客派發宣傳單張。港口衞生科人員近日亦已提醒港鐵公司、跨境巴士和客輪公司營辦商及機場管理局等加強防控蚊患措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。長者健康外展分隊已透過超過300個為長者及照顧者提供的健康推廣活動推廣預防基孔肯雅熱的資訊。此外，長者健康服務亦安排在十八區的長者健康中心派發相關的單張，讓長者了解其症狀及加強防患基孔肯雅熱的意識。家庭健康服務亦在轄下的母嬰健康院提醒孕婦及嬰幼兒照顧者有關預防基孔肯雅熱的注意事項。學生健康服務會在轄下的學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心向學生派發宣傳單張，讓他們了解基孔肯雅熱的症狀。

健康促進處致力透過不同途徑向市民宣傳預防蚊子傳播的疾病（包括基孔肯雅熱）的健康信息，包括於全港各區設置資訊站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/other/events/476.html），透過不同的線上及線下渠道發放有關健康資訊，並適時根據最新情況更新內容。為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。健康促進處亦聯絡與少數族裔相關的持份者（如提供服務的非政府機構及宗教團體等），向他們派發相關健康資料，讓更多市民獲得防蚊的資訊，共同預防基孔肯雅熱的傳播。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

中心建議市民使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食物環境衞生署（食環署）呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today (with photos),2025-08-09 18:30,2025-08-09 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900586.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 9) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the CF cases in recent days. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of five CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases, and one probable case has been recorded. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

In view of the occurrence of multiple imported cases in Hong Kong, the risk of secondary local transmission via mosquitoes exists. The CHP will issue a letter again to remind doctors to arrange testing for patients with clinically compatible presentations of CF regardless of travel history. Testing should also be considered for patients with any symptoms of CF and a travel history to affected areas, based on clinical judgment. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing to ensure rapid diagnosis.

The DH has enhanced publicity and education efforts regarding CF targeting different groups. The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, and also distributes leaflets to travellers. The Port Health Division staff has recently reminded MTR Corporation, cross-boundary coach and ferry companies operators, and the Airport Authority to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness of the elderly on preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, and reminding residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service has promoted information of CF prevention at more than 300 health promotion activities provided to the elderly and their carers. In addition, the Elderly Health Service has arranged for the distribution of relevant leaflets at Elderly Health Centres across the 18 districts, with a view to helping the elderly to learn about the symptoms of CF and enhance their awareness of prevention of CF. The Family Health Service has also advised pregnant women and infant carers at its Maternal and Child Health Centres about precautions for preventing CF. The Student Health Service will distribute promotional leaflets to students at its Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres so that students could learn more about symptoms of CF.

The Health Promotion Branch is committed to disseminating health information on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases (including CF) to the public through multiple channels. Measures include setting up Info Stations across various districts in Hong Kong (www.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html) and distributing relevant health messages through different online and offline platforms, with content updated as appropriate in light of the latest development. To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into ten ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHP website. The Health Promotion Branch has also contacted stakeholders serving ethnic minority groups (such as non-governmental organisations and religious groups) to distribute relevant health materials, so that more members of the public can access anti-mosquito information and work together to prevent the spread of CF.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The CHP recommends that the public properly use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients to effectively prevent mosquito bites. The following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."

HKSAR Government opposes slanderous remarks by the United States and members of G7 Rapid Response Mechanism on HKSAR's lawful act to pursue wanted persons endangering national security absconding from Hong Kong,2025-08-09 12:53,2025-08-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900338.htm,"In response to the untrue and biased remarks made by the United States and members of the Group of Seven Rapid Response Mechanism (G7 RRM) (including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union) and G7 RRM associate members regarding the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)'s lawful act to pursue wanted persons endangering national security absconding from Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government today (August 9) expressed strong dissatisfaction and opposition.

A spokesman said, ""Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong National Security Law) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press and of publication, and the freedoms of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, enjoyed by Hong Kong residents under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applicable to the HKSAR are protected in accordance with the law. Legislation that safeguards national security only targets a very small number of organisations and individuals that endanger national security.""

The spokesman also pointed out, ""The National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force announced on July 25 that 16 absconders, and Yuan Gong-yi, Fok Ka-chi and Choi Ming-da, who were specified as absconders in June and December 2024, had been put on wanted list. These 19 absconders are suspected of having committed offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law by organising, establishing, or participating in, outside the HKSAR, a subversive organisation named the 'Hong Kong Parliament'. The court has, upon application by the Police, issued arrest warrants against these 19 persons at large. The Secretary for Security had, on August 4, exercised the powers conferred by the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance to specify the above 16 persons as absconders, and specified the measures to be applied against the 16 relevant absconders by notices published in the Gazette.""

The spokesman said, ""Those absconders hiding outside Hong Kong are wanted and subject to arrest warrants issued by the court, not because they 'exercised freedom of expression', but because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security there. The 'Hong Kong Parliament' is an organisation aiming to subvert the state power. Its objectives include promoting 'self-determination', promulgating the so-called 'Hong Kong Constitution', and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People's Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of the central power of People's Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR, etc. with unlawful means. We therefore have taken such measures to make a significant impact.""

""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. Such acts and activities could bring very serious consequences. The HKSAR Government has the responsibility to pursue, in accordance with the law, persons suspected of having committed offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law or other offences endangering national security outside Hong Kong. It is indeed a demonstration of hypocrisy with double standards by any external forces or people with ulterior motives that, after the HKSAR Government has announced the relevant measures, attack the HKSAR in safeguarding national security dutifully, faithfully and in accordance with the law.""

""The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation. The HKSAR Government has the responsibility to pursue those who are suspected to have committed offences endangering national security and absconded overseas in accordance with the law.""

""Absconders should not think they can evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong. Ultimately, they will be liable for their acts constituting serious offences endangering national security and be sanctioned by the law. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law,"" the spokesman stressed.

The spokesman reiterated, ""The Constitution and the Basic Law steadfastly safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents. Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's situation will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail. The HKSAR Government will continue to unwaveringly discharge its duty in safeguarding national security."""
FEHD releases first batch of gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus in August,2025-08-09 12:10,2025-08-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900280.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) announced today (August 9) that it will enhance the dissemination of gravidtrap index data to allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

The FEHD has previously announced the gravidtrap index data in July and is currently conducting mosquito infestation surveys in various survey areas for August. Once the surveys are completed in individual survey areas and the latest gravidtrap and density indices are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media.

The first batch of gravidtrap index and density index for August, covering 13 survey areas, is as follows:

The index in So Kwun Wat, Tuen Mun District, reached 16.4 per cent. In response to the recent CF situation, the FEHD has activated a mechanism that strengthen mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20% or above. The FEHD will collaborate with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation, and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

Members of public should adopt the following measures, strengthening the prevention against the breeding of mosquitoes:


Tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water in containers inside their premises;
Remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
Completely change the water in flower vases at least once a week and remove the water on the plant saucers;
Properly cover all containers that hold water;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers; and
Level irregular ground surfaces and holes.


Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

屯門區掃管笏的指數達16.4%，食環署會按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），聯同有關部門及持份者攜手強化滅蚊工作，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

市民應採取以下措施，加強防範蚊子滋生：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除所有多餘積水，並消除滲漏源頭；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，清除盤栽墊碟裏的水；
蓋好所有盛水容器；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；及
鋪平或填補不平坦的地面及孔洞。


食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
特區政府反對美國和七國集團快速反應機制成員國就特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的抹黑言論,2025-08-09 11:15,2025-08-09 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900285.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（八月九日）就美國、七國集團快速反應機制成員國（包括加拿大、法國、德國、意大利、日本、英國及歐盟）和關聯成員國就有關特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的不實和偏頗言論，表示強烈不滿和反對。

發言人指出：「《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》（《香港國安法》）和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威等自由。維護國家安全的法例只針對極少部分的危害國家安全的組織和個人。」

發言人亦指出：「警務處國家安全處已於七月二十五日公布懸紅通緝十六名潛逃者，以及已於二○二四年六月和十二月先後被指明為潛逃者的袁弓夷、霍嘉誌及蔡明達。這十九名潛逃者在境外籌組、成立或參與一個名為『香港議會』的顛覆組織，涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》罪行。法院已應警方的申請，就上述十九名在逃人士發出拘捕令。保安局局長亦已於八月四日行使《維護國家安全條例》所賦予的權力，藉在憲報刊登公告，指明上述十六名潛逃者，並指明針對這十六名有關潛逃者施行的措施。」

發言人表示：「該等潛藏境外的潛逃者被通緝和被法院發出拘捕令，並非因為他們『行使發表的自由』，而是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當。『香港議會』是一個旨在顛覆國家政權的組織，其目標包括推動『自決』、制定所謂『香港憲法』，以非法手段推翻、破壞《中華人民共和國憲法》所確立的中華人民共和國根本制度或推翻中華人民共和國中央政權機關或者特區政權機關等，因此有需要採取是次措施強烈打擊。」

「危害國家安全是非常嚴重的罪行，該類行為或活動可能造成極為嚴重的後果。特區政府有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》及其他危害國家安全罪行的人。任何外部勢力及別有用心人士，在特區政府提出相關措施後，詆毀盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區，實乃典型的虛偽『雙標』。」

「香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關的人或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與其政治立場、背景或職業無關。特區政府有責任依法追究涉嫌干犯危害國家安全罪行並潛逃海外的人。」

發言人強調：「潛逃者不要妄想潛逃離港就可以逃避刑責。他們最終都需要為其危害國家安全的嚴重犯罪行為負上責任，受到法律制裁。任何倡議某些人或組織不應就其違法行為承擔其法律後果，等同給予其犯法特權，這完全違反法治精神。」

發言人重申：「香港居民的人權和自由受《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實保障。任何外國或外部勢力企圖詆毀香港情況，只會理屈詞窮，絕不會得逞。特區政府定當繼續堅定履職，維護國家安全。」"

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-09 06:46,2025-08-09 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900004.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 9) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

 Led by InvestHK, the delegation of 16 start-ups fostered meaningful connections not only with Thai corporates, investors, and tech leaders, but also among themselves, highlighting opportunities for cross-border collaboration and reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a leading start-up hub.

 The Techsauce Global Summit, held annually in Bangkok, is Southeast Asia's premier technology event, uniting global tech leaders, start-ups, investors, and corporates. With a mission to position Thailand as the Digital Gateway of Southeast Asia, the summit fosters networking, knowledge exchanges, and business opportunities across diverse sectors.

 This year's event attracted thousands of participants from across Asia Pacific, creating a dynamic environment for collaboration and innovation. The delegation's visit included site visits to four major Thai companies, facilitating discussions on potential collaborations in areas such as financial technology (fintech), digital transformation, and smart city solutions.

 The Head of Investment Promotion, Bangkok, at InvestHK, Mr Panakorn Dejthumrongwat, said, ""The Techsauce Global Summit 2025 highlighted the energy and potential of Southeast Asia's start-up ecosystem. This mission was a valuable opportunity to showcase what Hong Kong offers Thai start-ups looking to scale up, while also helping Hong Kong companies connect with Thai corporates and partners. It reflects the two-way opportunities for collaboration and growth, with Hong Kong serving as both a springboard to global markets and a gateway for inbound innovation to Asia.""

Showcasing Hong Kong's start-up ecosystem

 Senior Vice President of Startups at InvestHK, Mr Chin Yung Lu joined the fireside chat ""Tech in Hong Kong, and to the World: A Market Expansion Guide"" at the summit, alongside Hong Kong fintech start-up WealthRyse's Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, Mr David Lee.

 They highlighted Hong Kong's strengths for Thai and Southeast Asian start-ups, including its open and business-friendly environment, strong common-law legal system, and proximity to Mainland China via the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area). The speakers also emphasised Hong Kong's role as a strategic launch pad for international expansion, with access to global funding, a deep talent pool and supportive government policies that foster entrepreneurship and cross-border growth.

Global Fast Track Thailand Regional Round 2025

 On August 5, the Global Fast Track Thailand Regional Round 2025 pitching session saw eight innovative start-ups take the stage to present their innovative solutions. Eazy Digital was selected as the winner for its AI-powered solutions that are reshaping the insurance and brokerage sectors.

 The company secured a coveted spot in the semi-finals of the Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025, to be held in November 2025 in Hong Kong, offering a platform to gain further exposure and investment opportunities.

Hong Kong business mission: engaging Thai corporates and start-ups

 On August 6, the delegation visited four leading Thai corporates and venture capital firms, with a focus on proptech collaboration. The meetings with Magnolia Quality Development Corporation Limited, ECG Ventures, All Seasons Property, and Asset World Corporation offered in-depth insights into each company's vision and business operations, while also highlighting potential avenues for engagement and collaboration with start-ups in their respective sectors.

 Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Inspekly, Mr Steven Cheng said, ""The mission to Bangkok, hosted by InvestHK, was a valuable stepping stone into a new market. It gave us the rare opportunity to connect directly with leading real estate developers in Bangkok - an experience many businesses aspire to. We're grateful for the exposure and meaningful connections made possible through this mission.""

 Co-founder of Green Vigor Limited, Ms Penney Chong commented, ""This was a unique opportunity to showcase our green tech to Thai real estate leaders and investors. It helped us raise international visibility and build connections that will support our future growth in the region.""

 The Business Development/Sales Lead - South East Asia of Carnot Innovations Limited, Mr TS Velan, added, ""It was an awesome Thailand business mission. Direct C-suite connections in Thailand gave a good head start for growth start-ups like us who are expanding in the Thai market and the region.""

 The StartmeupHK delegation to Techsauce Global Summit 2025 underscores Hong Kong's commitment to fostering two-way innovation and collaboration with Southeast Asia. Hong Kong's start-up landscape has exhibited remarkable growth, continuing its upward trend from 2024.

 Despite external challenges, the findings from InvestHK's 2024 Startup Survey revealed that the total number of start-ups has surged to 4,694, employing 17,651 individuals - a record high that underscores the ecosystem's vitality.

 The encouraging results reflect Hong Kong's allure for start-up founders, bolstered by several key advantages. Hong Kong offers a simple tax system with a low tax rate, provides excellent accessibility to funding and access to the vast Mainland China market, particularly through Hong Kong's role as a gateway to the Greater Bay Area.

 By leveraging its position as a global financial hub, a gateway to the Greater Bay Area, and a nurturing environment for start-ups, Hong Kong continues to attract and empower entrepreneurs to achieve global success."
CHP investigates one new case and one probable case of chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-08-08 21:40,2025-08-08 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800846.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 8) announced that one new imported case and one probable case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded, as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the recent CF cases. The CHP reminded members of the public to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

The confirmed imported case involved a 66-year-old female with underlying illnesses, living in Kwai Tsing District. Initial investigations revealed that the patient travelled alone to Foshan in Guangdong Province between July 24 and August 5, but did not recall a history of mosquito bites during the stay. She developed fever, rash and joint pain since August 6. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital yesterday (August 7) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. She is currently in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for CF virus upon laboratory testing.

Since the patient stayed in Foshan during the whole incubation period, the CHP considered that the patient was infected during travel, and the case was classified as an imported case. She has no travel collaterals, and her household contacts are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance. The CHP's epidemiological investigations is ongoing and has reported the case to the health authorities of Guangdong.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the above patient, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspection of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


Another probable case involves a 22-year-old female with good past health. She lives in Eastern District. Initial investigations revealed that she travelled oversea between July 16 and August 4 (July 16 to 28: Madagascar; July 28 to August 3: Mauritius; August 3 to 4: Malaysia), then arrived Hong Kong on August 4. She recalled a history of mosquito bites during the stay in Madagascar. She developed fever, headache and multiple joint pain in Madagascar since July 25 and rash over four limbs since July 30. Her fever had subsided before returning to Hong Kong. After returning to Hong Kong, she sought medical attention due to joint pain at the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on August 4 and was admitted for treatment on the following day (August 5). She was discharged on August 7.

The patient's blood sample collected on August 4 tested negative in nucleic acid testing, while the blood sample collected on August 5 tested positive today for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to CF virus. The case is likely a recovered case. The CHP considered that the patient was no longer infectious to mosquito upon her return to Hong Kong. The CHP will arrange for a blood sample to be collected from the patient next week for a second antibody testing. If there is a more than four-fold increase in the antibody titre against the CF virus when compared with the first specimen, the case will be classified as a confirmed case.

A total of five CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases, and another probable case has been recorded. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal.

The DH has enhanced publicity and education efforts regarding CF targeting different groups. The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, and also distributes leaflets to travellers.The Port Health Division staff members has recently reminded MTR Corporation, cross-boundary coach and ferry companies operators and the Airport Authority Hong Kong to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness of the elderly on preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, and reminding residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service has promoted information of CF prevention at more than 300 health promotion activities provided to the elderly and their carers. In addition, the Elderly Health Service has arranged for the distribution of relevant leaflets at Elderly Health Centres across the 18 districts, with a view to helping the elderly to learn about the symptoms of CF and enhance their awareness of prevention of CF. The Family Health Service has also advised pregnant women and infant carers at its Maternal and Child Health Centres about precautions for preventing CF. The Student Health Service will distribute promotional leaflets to students at its Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres so that students could learn more about symptoms of CF.

The Health Promotion Branch is committed to disseminating health information on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases (including CF) to the public through multiple channels. Measures include setting up Info Stations across various districts in Hong Kong (www.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html) and distributing relevant health messages through different online and offline platforms, with content updated as appropriate in light of the latest developments. To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into ten ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHP website. The Health Promotion Branch has also contacted stakeholders serving ethnic minority groups (such as non-governmental organisations and religious groups etc.) to distribute relevant health materials, so that more members of the public can access anti-mosquito information and work together to prevent the spread of CF.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and alsoMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

Over 300 representatives from 10 government departments and relevant organisations participated in the exercise, including personnel from the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong), the HKPF, the Department of Health, the Hospital Authority, the Fire Services Department, the Immigration Department, the Civil Aid Service, the Auxiliary Medical Service, the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China Limited and the Hong Kong Association for Conflict and Catastrophe Medicine.

The Police will continue to maintain close collaboration with relevant government departments and stakeholders, review contingency plans and make comprehensive preparations for the upcoming 15th NG to ensure public safety and the smooth running of the events.
