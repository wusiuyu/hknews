​香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十一月十二日）宣布旗下迅清結算控股有限公司（迅清結算控股）引入香港交易所及結算有限公司（香港交易所）為策略性股東，以優化香港資本市場的金融基建，並支持本港固定收益及貨幣市場生態系統的長遠發展。

由金管局管理的外匯基金於二○二五年十月成立迅清結算控股，旨在全資擁有於去年成立以協助金管局執行香港中央證券存管平台——債務工具中央結算系統（CMU）的營運及業務發展工作的迅清結算有限公司（迅清結算）。為進一步支持香港資本市場的多元和可持續發展，迅清結算控股引入香港交易所為策略性股東，後者將以認購新股形式，持有迅清結算控股的20%股權。交易完成後，外匯基金及香港交易所將分別持有迅清結算控股的80%和20%股權。

透過此次合作，金管局與香港交易所將憑藉其資源、科技、人才及專業知識的結合，推進香港的交易後證券基礎設施發展成為區內主要的中央證券存管平台（CSD）。合作亦有助CMU的持續商業化，以及擴大投資者CSD服務、託管資產類別及抵押品管理服務等業務發展，提升香港跨資產類別的結算效率。

金管局總裁及迅清結算控股董事會主席余偉文表示：「金管局、迅清結算及香港交易所的策略性合作是香港金融基建發展的一個重要里程碑，為推動CMU發展成為多元資產平台奠定基礎，讓投資者可一站式管理股票及債券，同時促進中國內地、香港與國際市場之間高效的雙向投資流動。我們期待與香港交易所和迅清結算攜手，共同發揮協同效應，開創更多新機遇，進一步鞏固香港作為領先的國際金融中心、全球風險管理中心和全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。」

香港交易所集團行政總裁陳翊庭表示：「我們非常高興能與金管局及迅清結算合作，推動香港固定收益及貨幣生態圈的下一階段增長。發展固定收益及貨幣業務是香港交易所重點業務戰略之一，這項投資展現了我們致力構建多元化且充滿活力的多元資產類別生態圈，並有助於促進市場的長遠穩健發展。隨着全球投資者越來越關注亞洲機遇，香港交易所將與監管機構及市場參與者緊密合作，進一步提升香港作為全球債券融資、風險管理及離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位，發揮香港作為全球固定收益及貨幣中心的潛力。」

根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》，金管局仍是CMU的擁有者及營運者。與CMU會員的合約及與其他系統建立的聯網仍屬金管局。"
Opening speech by SEE at COP30 China Pavilion's Side Event (English only),2025-11-12 08:00,2025-11-12 08:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/12/P2025111200062.htm,"âFollowing is the opening speech by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, at the China Pavilion's Side Event: ""Converging Innovation in Hong Kong: Forging a Resilient City and a Global Green Finance Hub"" of the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, on November 11 (Belém time):

Mr Van Begin (Secretary General of ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, Mr Gino Van Begin), Dr Lam (Chairman of the Council for Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development, Dr Lam Ching-choi), Mr Marguccio (Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Sustainable Energy for All, Mr Stefano Marguccio), Ophelia (Vice-Chairperson of Friends of the Earth (HK)), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is my honour and pleasure to meet you at the China Pavilion. On behalf of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), may I extend our warmest welcome to you all.

Like you, I have travelled all the way to Belém, the gateway to the Amazon River, to explore solutions for the climate crisis.

As a Special Administrative Region of China, Hong Kong has taken early actions to reduce carbon. We stopped the building of coal-fired power plants in 1997 and have been gradually shifting to natural gas and nuclear power.

Hong Kong reached carbon peak in 2014. Compared to the peak, the carbon emissions have reduced by about a quarter now; per capita emissions have reduced by about 30 per cent to below 4.5 tonnes per year, which is about a quarter of that of the United States (US) and 60 per cent of the European Union.

To progress further, Hong Kong has set an interim target to half the peak emission before 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050.

To achieve these targets, Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050 has put forward a four-pronged strategy: to go for net-zero carbon electricity supply; to promote energy saving and green buildings; to promote green transport; and to achieve zero landfilling of wastes, which is necessary to reduce methane.

By 2035, Hong Kong will stop using coal for power generation; increase the share of zero carbon electricity supply to over 60 per cent; stop the selling of conventional fuelled private cars, including hybrids; and stop landfilling of municipal wastes.

As at today, the use of coal for electricity generation has been reduced to about 15 per cent, around 60 per cent of the electricity supply is by natural gas, and 25 per cent by nuclear. Last year we also published a hydrogen development strategy to build a framework conducive to the development of hydrogen in a prudent and orderly manner.

We are progressing well also on promoting green transport. Out of 10 newly registered private cars, seven are now electric. We are also developing a public charging network based on super-fast charging technologies. Furthermore, an electric vehicle battery recycling facility is coming into operation next year.

To go for zero landfilling, Hong Kong has made tremendous efforts in the last three years which has successfully reduced waste disposal by 10 per cent. Quantities of material recycled have increased by 30 per cent.

On waste treatment, the first large scale waste to energy facility is coming into operation this month and the second one is being tendered for completion by 2030.

Recognising the importance of green fuels, we are working with authorities in Chinese Mainland to develop a production base for sustainable aviation fuel in the Greater Bay area. In parallel, we are also gearing up to develop Hong Kong into a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre.

Hong Kong is a leading international financial centre and Asia's sustainable finance hub. We can help channelling international capital to support the low carbon green transition.

Our capital market offers a wide range of green and sustainable investment products. As of June 2025, over 200 ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds were authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission, with assets under management over HK$1.1 trillion.

In 2024, the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to around US$43 billion, capturing around 45 per cent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years.

As of October 2025, the Hong Kong SAR Government has issued green bonds totalling about US$31 billion equivalent. These bonds covered Hong Kong dollar, Renminbi, Euro and US dollar, providing important benchmarks for potential issuers in Hong Kong and in the region.

Accurate, consistent and relevant information about sustainability-related matters is vital. We have implemented the Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards, fully aligned with the global baseline set by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

Hong Kong's Core Climate, is currently the only carbon marketplace offering settlement in both Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi for international voluntary carbon credits.

We welcome and encourage enterprises worldwide to utilise Hong Kong's capital market and financial services for raising international capital for their sustainable projects.

Ladies and gentlemen, to tackle the challenge of climate change, international co-operation is critical. This is why all of us are gathering here.

The low carbon green transition is a difficult journey and yet has opened up many new collaboration opportunities.

Hong Kong looks forward to working hand in hand with all of you to build a climate resilient and sustainable future for our next generations.

Thank you."

政制及內地事務局局長：今日我們辦了兩場選舉論壇，分別是新界西南和新界東北。兩場論壇的情況，安排上都理想，無論候選人的表現，包括其團隊打氣的情況，以至整體向選民交代政綱和對不同議題的看法，我們認為，透過論壇都得以向觀眾和選民充分展示，讓他們看見。這方面亦提升了社會的關注度，達致我們預期的效果。

記者：局長，候選人之間的火花多些，社會關注度會否再提高？接下來會否微調論壇的設置，例如互相質詢環節會否加大？

政制及內地事務局局長：當然，在我們設計的不同論壇環節上，我們是希望可以透過互動環節令大家加深對候選人的認識，包括其政綱和就不同議題的看法、理想、理念和抱負等。我們發覺透過不同的環節的設定，的而且確做到這個效果。當然，在辯論環節方面，我們希望大家透過不同環節的互動，令大家更明白對方的看法。

記者：候選人互相詢問是否你們想要的效果？30秒就「叮」，很多候選人未講完就被「叮」，這個情況有否需要改善？

政制及內地事務局局長：我們希望透過辯論環節加強互動，大家可以不停交換意見。說到底，我們希望有良性競爭，良性地互相交換意見，這點才是最重要。

記者：但30秒，候選人連問問題都不夠時間，之後會否優化這個安排？

政制及內地事務局局長：今日是頭兩場，接下來我們會因應經驗再看安排上是否需要作出適當調整。

記者：聽聞候選人收到指示，不能參加傳媒舉辦的論壇，是否屬實？會否不利於選舉氣氛？

政制及內地事務局局長：這點我不評論，我未聽到有這個情況。

記者：選舉問題上，偏向引用《施政報告》內政府的施政方向，有沒有看見一眾候選人對於《施政報告》的政策都全收下，沒有提出反對，你怎樣看？

政制及內地事務局局長：其實我們設定問題時，希望是比較全港性、大家都關心的問題，很多都是大家想候選人能提供其專業意見的問題；在辯論環節，有較多是地區性大家關心的問題。在設定上我們希望透過不同環節，讓他們比對政綱，對地區的看法，或對全港性、大家比較關心的問題，都有綜合性表達的看法 。

記者：長者中心和殘疾人士的支援中心，有兩萬元津貼，給他們交通服務去投票。推行這個安排是否想推高投票率？背後原意是甚麼？

政制及內地事務局局長：我們希望令大家都能行使投票權，希望盡量便利，令大家都可以有效地行使投票權。"
SCED hosts cocktail reception to give update on overseas ETOs' and Mainland Offices' ongoing efforts in promoting strengths and opportunities of Hong Kong (with photos),2025-11-11 20:57,2025-11-11 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100750.htm,"  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, today (November 11) hosted a cocktail reception for about 200 guests, including members of the Executive Council, officials from the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR, representatives from consuls in Hong Kong, chambers of commerce, major trade associations and the arts and cultural industries, as well as relevant government board and committee members, to update them on the ongoing efforts of the overseas Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) and the Mainland Offices in promoting Hong Kong's diverse strengths and opportunities.

 The reception was held during the return of the Heads of the 14 ETOs and five Mainland Offices (HETOs) to Hong Kong for the annual meeting of HETOs.

 Speaking at the reception, Mr Yau said that despite the persistent uncertainties in the global economy and trade arising from intensifying geopolitical tensions, Hong Kong continued to demonstrate resilience. The ETOs, being the frontline representatives of the HKSAR Government responsible for promoting trade and investment ties between Hong Kong and its major trading partners, as well as the official representative to safeguard Hong Kong's economic and trade interests abroad, play a more critical role than ever.

 Mr Yau said that to further leverage Hong Kong's unique advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, this year's Policy Address has put forward an array of initiatives to proactively explore new economic growth areas to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness and international influence. He briefed the guests on the measures that are particularly relevant to the work of the ETOs and the Mainland Offices, including the establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global to provide one-stop customised support services to Mainland enterprises venturing overseas through Hong Kong; proactively supporting local small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups in exploring high-potential markets and the organisation of overseas business missions through the new functional platform ""Economic and Trade Express""; as well as formulating packages of preferential policies covering land grants, land premiums, financial subsidies and tax incentives to attract high value-added industries and high-potential enterprises to set up businesses in Hong Kong, particularly in the Northern Metropolis.

 Mr Yau added that to further expand Hong Kong's circle of friends in trade, the Government has been actively seeking to co-operate with trading partners to deepen Hong Kong's international economic and trade networks through forging free trade agreements (FTAs), investment agreements and memoranda of understanding. In particular, the Government has been proactively seeking Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest FTA. In addition, the Chief Executive visited 12 Belt and Road countries in the past three years. Principal officials of the HKSAR Government also conducted various visits with the essential support provided by the ETOs and the Mainland Offices to strengthen the economic and trade network of Hong Kong.

 Mr Yau emphasised that the Government will continue to expand the network of ETOs to cover emerging markets with high economic potential. He shared with the guests that the Hong Kong ETO in Kuala Lumpur will commence operation this year, and the coverage of the ETOs in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region will be expanded to further deepen Hong Kong's work on economic and trade promotion in ASEAN and neighbouring countries.

 Looking forward, Mr Yau noted that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Meeting in 2026 will be held in Shenzhen, which will help promote the vast opportunities in the GuangdongâHong KongâMacao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Hong Kong will continue to fully participate in the GBA development and actively consolidate the city's position as an international trade centre and a regional intellectual property trading centre.

 In concluding, Mr Yau called on all sectors to continue supporting the work of the ETOs and the Mainland Offices. He also took the opportunity to appeal to all members of the organisations and associations to cast their votes on the polling day of the Legislative Council General Election on December 7, exercising their civic rights to elect a new term of responsible, visionary and capable members of the Legislative Council."
商經局局長舉辦酒會介紹駐海外經貿辦及內地辦事處持續推廣香港優勢及機遇的工作（附圖）,2025-11-11 20:57,2025-11-11 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100641.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（十一月十一日）舉行酒會，招待約200位嘉賓，包括行政會議成員、中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區（特區）聯絡辦公室官員、中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特區特派員公署官員、駐港領事和商會、主要貿易組織及文化藝術界的代表，以及相關政府委員會的成員，向他們介紹香港駐海外經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦）及內地辦事處持續推廣香港多元優勢和機遇的工作。

是次酒會是在十四個經貿辦和五個內地辦事處的主管返港出席駐海外及駐內地辦事處主管周年大會期間舉行。

丘應樺在酒會上致辭時表示，儘管地緣政治局勢緊張為全球經濟和貿易帶來持續不明朗因素，香港繼續展現韌力。經貿辦作為特區政府的前線代表，負責推動香港與主要貿易夥伴的貿易和投資關係，亦是維護香港在外經貿利益的官方代表，其角色較以往任何時候都更為重要。

丘應樺表示，為進一步善用香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，今年《施政報告》公布一系列積極開拓新經濟增長點的政策措施，以提升香港的競爭力和國際影響力。他向來賓簡介當中與經貿辦和內地辦事處工作尤其相關的措施，包括成立內地企業出海專班，為經香港拓展海外業務的內地企業提供一站式、量身訂造的支援服務；透過新設的「經貿一站通」功能平台，積極支援香港的中小企業和初創企業開拓高潛力市場及組織海外商務考察；以及制訂涵蓋批地、地價、資助或稅務減免優惠的優惠政策包，吸引高增值產業和高潛力企業落戶香港，特別是北部都會區。

丘應樺續說，為進一步擴展香港的貿易「朋友圈」，政府一直積極尋求與貿易夥伴合作，透過簽訂自由貿易協定、投資協定和諒解備忘錄，擴闊香港的國際經貿網絡。其中，政府一直積極尋求香港盡早加入作為全球規模最大自由貿易協定的《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》。此外，行政長官在過去三年訪問12個「一帶一路」國家，特區政府主要官員亦多次外訪，以加強香港的經貿網絡，經貿辦和內地辦事處均為該些外訪提供所需支援。

丘應樺強調，政府會繼續擴大經貿辦網絡，以涵蓋新興及具高經濟潛力的市場。他與來賓分享，特區政府駐吉隆坡經貿辦將於今年內投入運作，並會擴大東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）地區經貿辦的覆蓋範圍，以進一步深化香港在東盟及鄰近地區的經貿推廣工作。

展望未來，丘應樺指，二○二六年亞太區經濟合作組織領導人非正式會議將於深圳舉行，將有助推廣粵港澳大灣區的龐大機遇，香港會繼續全力參與大灣區發展，並積極鞏固香港作為國際貿易中心和區域知識產權貿易中心的地位。

丘應樺在總結時，呼籲各界繼續支持經貿辦和內地辦事處的工作。他亦藉此機會鼓勵各組織及團體的成員於十二月七日立法會換屆選舉投票日投票，行使公民權利，選出新一屆有承擔、有遠見和有才能的立法會議員。"
入境處打擊外傭違反逗留條件拘二十一人（附圖）,2025-11-11 20:20,2025-11-11 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100756.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十一月四日至今日(十一月十一日)一連八日在全港各區展開代號「劍魚」的反非法勞工行動。在該項打擊外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在港違反逗留條件的行動中，入境處共拘捕二十一人，包括十四名懷疑非法勞工及七名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的人士。

行動中，入境處人員一共搜查了四十七個目標地點，包括餐廳、酒樓、零售店舖、燒烤場、活動場地、外傭中介公司及商業大廈單位等。被捕的懷疑非法勞工分別為三男十一女，年齡介乎二十七至五十一歲。當中五名為現職外傭、四名為逾期逗留的前外傭、兩名為持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）人士、一名輸入勞工、一名訪港旅客及一名非法入境者。被捕的非法勞工主要在從事洗碗及清潔等工作，調查亦發現有現職外傭在合約傭主的活動場地或燒烤場從事合約以外的工作。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的七名人士為兩男五女，年齡介乎三十至七十四歲，他們均為涉案公司或餐廳的相關負責人或被捕外傭的合約傭主。

入境處發言人說：「外傭只能根據合約附錄的「住宿及家務安排」為僱主料理家務。外傭不得受僱於其他人士擔任任何職務，包括兼職家務工作。僱主亦不得要求或容許傭工為其他人士擔任任何工作。」

入境處發言人強調：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

此外，入境處發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰會由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

Immigration Department arrests 21 persons during operations targeting foreign domestic helpers who breached conditions of stay (with photos),2025-11-11 20:20,2025-11-11 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100723.htm,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Swordfish"", for eight consecutive days from November 4 to 11, targeting foreign domestic helpers (helper) who breached their conditions of stay. A total of 21 persons, including 14 suspected illegal workers and seven suspected employers, were arrested.

During the operation, ImmD investigators raided 47 target locations including restaurants, retail shops, barbecue site, activity venues, employment agencies, and commercial building units. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised 3 men and 11 women, aged 27 to 51. Among them, 5 persons were current helpers, 4 persons were overstaying ex-helpers, 2 persons were holders of recognizance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong, 1 person was imported worker, 1 person was visitor, and 1 person was illegal immigrant. ImmD investigators found most of the suspected illegal workers performing dish washing and cleaning, etc. During the operation, ImmD investigators also apprehended current helpers suspected of performing non-contractual duties at an activity venue and a barbecue site. Meanwhile, seven suspected employers, comprising two men and five women, aged 30 to 74, were in charge of the involved companies or restaurants and suspected of employing the suspected illegal workers and contractual employers of the arrested current helpers.

""A helper should only perform domestic duties for the employer as listed in the ""Schedule of Accommodation and Domestic Duties"" attached to the Contract. The helper should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employer should not require or allow the helper to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

The spokesman warned that, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.

The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

3億歐元的四年期債券為2.512%


繼二○二三年及二○二四年兩次成功發行數碼綠色債券後，是次發行是香港特區政府在推動債券代幣化進程上的又一個里程碑，不僅保留了以往發行的主要創新特性，包括以數碼原生形式發行、為投資者提供透過傳統市場基建參與買賣的選項，以及將綠色債券披露融入數碼資產平台，亦在以下範疇應用更多創新技術並取得突破：


將數碼貨幣應用於交收程序：港元及人民幣債券的一級發行除設有傳統交收方式外，也引入了以代幣化央行貨幣交收的選項，有助進一步縮短交收時間、降低成本及對手方信用風險，亦是全球首批在交收程序中應用人民幣及港元代幣化央行貨幣的數碼債券。




擴大規模：是次發行金額達100億港元，四個幣種的債券總認購金額超過1,300億，為目前全球最大的數碼債券發行。此外，發行年期延長至最多五年，以滿足投資者對更長年期數碼債券的需求。與以往的發行相比，安排行和數碼資產平台直接參與者數量上升，投資者數量更顯著增加。在投資者類別方面，是次發行繼續吸引廣泛的環球機構投資者認購，涵蓋資產管理公司、銀行、保險公司、私人銀行及其他機構，包括眾多首次認購數碼債券的投資者。




加強全球標準的採用：是次所有幣種的債券發行均有採用數字代幣標識符（DTIs）（註一），即由國際標準化組織的ISO 24165標準定義的數碼代幣全球識別標準。這批債券的DTIs與其國際證券識別編碼及發行人的法律實體識別編碼直接連結，將這批債券融入全球標準的整體架構。




此外，在第二次數碼債券發行的基礎上，本次發行深化了國際資本市場協會的債券數據分類術語​（註二）的採用，以便利傳統資本市場與數字產業不同交易方與系統之間持續交換發行資訊，從而提升互操作性，並推動端對端自動化。


財政司司長陳茂波表示：「特區政府這次發行的第三批數碼綠色債券，發行總額創新高，達100億港元，認購熱烈，反映市場對相關代幣化產品的支持；同時，也應用了多項創新技術，進一步推動以金融科技賦能債券以及綠色和可持續金融市場發展。特區政府會通過恆常化發行代幣化債券，助力市場建立更全面的基準，擴大數字金融的更廣泛應用，鼓勵產品和服務創新。」

財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇表示：「這是政府發行的第三批代幣化債券，也是《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》公布將發行代幣化政府債券常規化後首次。香港的獨特優勢讓我們在推動傳統金融邁進數字資產時代方面盡佔先機。這次發行結合我們既有的金融服務優勢，將進一步鞏固香港作為領先綠色及可持續金融中心的地位。」

香港金融管理局總裁余偉文表示：「自二○二三年以來，我們致力於每次香港特區政府數碼債券的發行中進一步擴大市場規模並尋求創新，以實現香港成為全球數字資產中心的願景。是次發行應用了代幣化央行貨幣，為未來融入其他形式的數碼貨幣奠定基礎，並促進不同數碼基建之間的互操作性，發揮彼此之間的協同效應。我們很高興看到市場參與度顯著增加，更多銀行及首次認購數碼債券的投資者踴躍參與是次發行，反映本港數碼債券市場規模正在逐步擴大。」

HKSAR Government's Third Digital Green Bonds Offering,2025-11-11 20:19,2025-11-11 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100724.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (the HKSAR Government) today (November 11) announced the successful pricing of around HK$10 billion worth of digital green bonds (Digital Green Bonds) denominated in HK dollars (HKD), Renminbi (RMB), US dollars (USD) and euro (EUR) under the Government Sustainable Bond Programme.

Following a virtual roadshow from November 3 to 7, the Digital Green Bonds were priced on November 10 as follows:


HKD2.5 billion 2-year tranche at 2.5 per cent
RMB2.5 billion 5-year tranche at 1.9per cent
USD300 million 3-year tranche at 3.633per cent
EUR300 million 4-year tranche at 2.512per cent


The latest issuance marks another milestone on the HKSAR Government's bond tokenisation journey, following the two successful issuances in 2023 and 2024. While retaining the key innovative features of the previous issuance, including issuing in a digitally native format, providing the option of investor access via traditional market infrastructure, and integrating green bond disclosures with the digital assets platform, the latest issuance has also introduced innovative features and achieved breakthroughs in the following areas:


Integration of digital money in the settlement process:For both the HKD and RMB tranches, the option to settle via tokenised central bank money was introduced alongside traditional settlement rails in the primary issuance process, which helped further reduce settlement time, costs and counterparty credit risk.This also marks the first digital bond offering in the world that integrates tokenised central bank money in the form of e-CNY and e-HKD in the settlement process.
	
Expanding scale: This issuance achieved a record issuance size of HK$10 billion, with the total subscription amount across four currency tranches reaching over HK$130 billion, marking the largest digital bond issuance in the world to date. Additionally, the tenor was extended to up to five years, addressing investor demand for longer-term digital bonds. Alongside an increase in the number of direct participants to the digital assets platform and arranging banks, compared to the previous issuance, the number of investors also expanded markedly. In terms of investor type, the issuance continued to attract subscriptions by a wide spectrum of institutional investors globally, covering asset managers, banks, insurance companies, private banks and others, including a substantial number of first-time investors in digital bonds.




Advancing adoption of global standards: Digital Token Identifiers (DTIs) (Note 1), a global identification standard for digital tokens defined by the International Organisation for Standardisation's ISO 24165 standard, were obtained for all tranches of the issuance.The DTIs for this issuance are directly linked to the bonds' International Securities Identification Numbers and to the issuer's Legal Identity Identifier, embedding the bonds in the wider framework of global standards.


Additionally, building on the second digital bond issuance, this issuance expanded on the adoption of the International Capital Market Association's Bond Data Taxonomy(BDT) (Note 2), with the aim of facilitating the consistent exchange of issuance information between different transaction parties and systems in traditional capital markets and the digital industry, thereby improving interoperability and fostering end-to-end automation.

  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, said, ""The HKSAR Government's third issuance of digital green bond attracted overwhelming subscription, with the issuance amount reaching a new high of HK$10 billion, reflecting the market support for tokenised products. A number of innovative features have also been introduced to further promote fintech empowerment in the development of bond market as well as green and sustainable finance market. The Government will regularise the issuance of tokenised bond, support the establishment of comprehensive benchmarks, and promote innovative products and services for a wider application of digital finance.""

  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""This is the third batch of tokenised green bond issuance by the Government, and the first after the announcement of the Government's Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong to among other things regularise the issuance of tokenised Government bonds. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to connect traditional finance to the digital asset era. Riding on our established strengths in financial services, this issuance will further consolidate Hong Kong's status as a leading green and sustainable finance hub.""

  The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,Mr Eddie Yue, said, ""With each issuance of the HKSAR Government's digital bonds since 2023, we have sought to further scale the market and explore new innovations, to reinforce the vision for Hong Kong to become a global hub for digital assets. The integration of tokenised central bank money in this issuance lays the foundation for future integration with other forms of digital money, fostering interoperability and unlocking new synergies across different digital infrastructures. We are also pleased to see a significant increase in market participation, with more banks and first-time digital bond investors actively participating in this issuance, a clear reflection of the progress made in scaling our digital bond market.""

National Security Interactive School Drama - Campus Chef Challenge officially launched (with photos),2025-11-11 18:06,2025-11-11 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100262.htm,"âThe Security Bureau (SB) today (November 11) held the launching ceremony and premiere for the National Security Interactive School Drama - Campus Chef Challenge, with some 400 guests, school principals, teachers and primary school students attending. The interactive drama was organised by the SB and supported by the Education Bureau. Performed by a professional theatre troupe, national security education for primary school students was conducted through the interesting stories of ""Andy and Security Bear"" and an interactive format, with a view to strengthening students' awareness of safeguarding national security of their own accord. The interactive school drama will also be staged at primary schools in various districts across Hong Kong.

Addressing the ceremony, the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, said that key concepts of national security should be learned from an early age. The drama incorporated scenarios that primary students may encounter in their daily lives, as well as interactive elements, allowing students to learn important concepts of national security and law-abidingness in a relaxed atmosphere. He added that the SB will arrange for the school drama to be performed publicly next year to further embed the idea that ""security brings prosperity"" into the community.

Also officiating at the ceremony, the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said the Education Bureau (EDB) has consistently collaborated with the SB to actively support schools in promoting and deepening national security education. The interactive school drama is an innovative idea that can introduce the concept of safeguarding national security in a light-hearted and interesting way, and facilitate the promotion of national security education in schools in a diverse manner. She expressed hope that the education sector would actively arrange performances at schools. Looking ahead, the EDB will continue to work in partnership with the SB to enable national security education to take root on campuses.

Set against the background of ""Andy and Security Bear"", the national security comics launched by the SB that have been well received by students, the National Security Interactive School Drama - Campus Chef Challenge brings out important national security concepts and messages through relatable storylines in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. By adding interactive elements, the drama allows students to join the main characters, Andy and Security Bear, through questions and answers as well as interactive games, to deepen the understanding of the importance of safeguarding national sovereignty and security and fight against misconduct that endangers national security. The interactive drama, produced by Spring-Time Experimental Theatre, will be performed in at least 20 primary schools across the city in the coming months following its formal launch today.

Taking the opportunity of the premiere, Mr Tang, Dr Choi, and performers also encouraged the public to fulfil their civic responsibility by casting their votes in the Legislative Council General Election to be held on December 7, to elect patriotic and capable people to contribute to Hong Kong's future development together."

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-11 17:49,2025-11-11 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100631.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 11), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 59 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, three were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the recent outbreak of CF has shown a sustained downward trend. There were 107 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (November 2 to 8), showing a significant decrease compared to the previous week (October 26 to November 1), which reported 259 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Shenzhen (30 cases), Jiangmen (23 cases), Foshan (21 cases) and Zhuhai (10 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  In light of three locally acquired cases recorded at the end of last month and early this month, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 25 000 individuals residing or working in higher-risk districts through four health consultation booths, along with its enquiry hotline, door-to-door visits and questionnaire surveys conducted in the districts concerned. The CHP has arranged blood tests for a total of 56 persons who had mild symptoms, and all tested negative. The enquiry hotline (2125 2373) continues to operate daily from 9am to 6pm to provide assessments for individuals residing or working in higher-risk districts.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
  âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

十一月份第一批涵蓋15個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

與上月（即二○二五年十月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這15個監察區中，13個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有兩區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the first batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 15 survey areas in November, all were below 10 per cent.

Among these 15 survey areas, 13 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index the previous month, i.e. October 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Two other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
二零二五年十月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-11-11 16:30,2025-11-11 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100241.htm,"政府統計處今日（十一月十一日）發表二零二五年十月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年九月在收縮區域的43.8上升至二零二五年十月的44.8，而未來一個月（即二零二五年十一月）的業務收益展望動向指數為47.5。按行業分析，大部分統計調查涵蓋的行業的業務收益現時動向指數在二零二五年十月較上月上升，特別是飲食業（從38.8上升至40.7）及零售業（從42.8上升至44.5）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年九月的46.5上升至二零二五年十月的47.1，而未來一個月（即二零二五年十一月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.6。

評論

政府發言人表示，十月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均進一步改善，延續自踏入下半年以來的上升趨勢。整體就業情況維持穩定。

展望未來，香港經濟進一步穩健增長，將為本地營商氣氛提供有力支持，然而持續的各種外圍不確定因素仍需留意。政府會密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指從業人數少於50人的公司。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於規模較大的公司的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己公司情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for October 2025,2025-11-11 16:30,2025-11-11 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100274.htm,"The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (November 11) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for October 2025.

The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 43.8 in September 2025 in the contractionary zone to 44.8 in October 2025, whereas the one-month’s ahead (i.e. November 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 47.5. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts for majority of the surveyed sectors rose in October 2025 as compared with previous month, particularly for the restaurants (from 38.8 to 40.7) and retail trade (from 42.8 to 44.5).

The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades increased from 46.5 in September 2025 to 47.1 in October 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month’s time (i.e. November 2025) was 47.6.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month’s time both improved further in October, sustaining the uptrend since entering the second half of the year. The overall employment situation remained stable.

Looking ahead, local business sentiment will be well underpinned by further solid growth of the Hong Kong economy, yet the ongoing external uncertainties still warrant attention. The Government will monitor the situation closely.

Further information

The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to companies with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent companies in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own companies rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-11-11 16:25,2025-11-11 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/11/P2025111100543.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on November 10 to noon today (November 11), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 162 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 179 155 samples of food imported from Japan (including 116 720 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 40 210 samples of local catch respectively.

政制及內地事務局局長：我覺得這次論壇，暫時第一場來說，不論是氣氛，或者候選人的表現、大家的動員、互動都很好，亦都達致我們的目標，希望可以令到選民或市民更加了解。我看到候選人都有充分時間，將他們的政綱以至就不同議題的觀點都可以向大家展示到，我相信這有助於選民考慮他們的選擇。

記者：出席者都說覺得透過這個論壇可以了解多點候選人的政綱。會不會接下來三十多場的形式都是一樣的？還有會不會覺得大家反應踴躍，對於投票率都有一個目標？

政制及內地事務局局長：大致上來說，我們這個論壇會因應實際情況、選區或者界別，會設有不同的環節，大致上都會包括自我介紹，又或者就不同議題的觀點的表達，大致都會包含這些，盡量都希望大家可以比較充分地了解到候選人本身的政綱，以至對很多問題的看法。

記者：想問為甚麼會有中途離場不能回去的安排？因為我剛才看到很多老人家因為想去廁所，怕不能返回便不敢去？

政制及內地事務局局長：這個我們會繼續優化安排的，在這點上我們會視乎情況。畢竟這是我們的第一場，在接下來的場次，我們會因應經驗更加做好這個安排。

記者：今次的設定，候選人只講政綱，會否覺得候選人沒甚麼互動，例如互相質詢？

政制及內地事務局局長：我們今次希望第一，就是有一個優質的選舉文化，大家盡量比政綱、比能力、比承擔、比貢獻。至於環節的設計，一方面固然是希望大家可以就不同議題提出觀點。我相信在不同的組合或者不同的選區界別、不同的候選人之間的互動，會產生不同的作用。

記者：見剛才支持者反應都踴躍，會否對投票率有個目標？

政制及內地事務局局長：今次我們辦這個論壇，其中一個主要目的就是希望提高社會的關注度。在社會關注度提高的同時，我相信大家踴躍去投票的情況一定會提升的。

記者：局長，我剛才看到候選人的表現，其實他們都很少會互相問問題或者辯論，會不會覺得不太滿意，沒有做到論壇的效果呢？

政制及內地事務局局長：我相信在不同選區的論壇中有不同的候選人，大家會產生不同的化學作用，我不擔心這件事。我相信大家一方面固然可以在良性競爭、優中選優的情況下，大家可以有良性的互動，讓大家表達他們的政綱以至看法，這個我並不擔心。謝謝大家。"

記者：怎樣派票去吸引多些市民？會不會在門口外直接派給大眾？

政制及內地事務局局長：因為我們很多時候要預先安排好，所以很多事情我們之前會有安排，盡量讓多些市民入場，可以看到。

記者：對於今天入場的人數，你怎麼看呢，是否滿意？

今天是我們舉行第一場的選舉論壇。目前來說，我們這次看到的情況，今天入場的情況非常順利，入場的觀眾也非常踴躍，亦有很多助選團，氣氛亦很濃厚。我們希望透過這次的選舉論壇，可以令到選民、市民、大家對候選人的政綱和各方面的情況更加掌握，從而在他們的投票選擇方面，可以作出一個好的選擇。

政制及內地事務局局長：都不會的。我們在（開始）之前會跟他們講好了整個安排的流程和情況。我們相信那些助選團都可以有序地進行助選工作。

記者：那如果之後真的有點混亂，會否考慮在之後的論壇取消助選團打氣的環節？

政制及內地事務局局長：目前來說，我們看那個情況是比較順利和有序的。

記者：有沒有限定他們要帶多少人入場？

政制及內地事務局局長：有的。他們全部都有限定的人數。我們會做到盡量公平，每一次的候選人安排都是公平的，每一位候選人，包括他們的助選團人數都有限定。

記者：有沒有說可以帶多少人來撐場？

政制及內地事務局局長：現在暫時來說，我們這次地方（選區）來說可以帶50個。

記者：剛才你說氣氛都踴躍，暫時來說一切都順利。有沒有甚麼呼籲？下個月就是投票日。還有如何看投票率？

政制及內地事務局局長：當然，這方面我經常強調，立法會選舉對香港的良政善治是極為重要的，對每一位市民來說都是一件大事。我當然希望全港市民大家都能夠踴躍支持投票，在投票日能夠踴躍地去投票，這是我們最大的目標。多謝大家。"
