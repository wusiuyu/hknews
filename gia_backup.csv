​立法會二十二題：支援公共租住房屋租戶,2025-07-09 16:05,2025-07-09 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900451.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）立法會會議上黃國議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉本港過去曾發生多宗公共租住房屋（公屋）住戶在其單位內死亡，但長時間未被他人發現的個案，更有遺體被發現時已化成骸骨；亦有照顧者在公屋單位內猝死，但其同住親屬因精神上無行為能力或其他原因而未能向外求助及報警而被迫「伴屍」。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去十年每年房屋署人員在進行家訪或執行收回單位工作（例如破門入屋）時，發現有人在相關單位內死亡的個案宗數為何；

（二）過去十年每年社會福利署（社署）因跟進公屋住戶的福利服務事宜時，發現有人在相關單位內死亡的個案宗數為何；

（三）據悉在公屋住戶連續欠租兩個月後，房屋署會多次透過電話聯絡、書面通知或進行家訪等方式嘗試聯絡相關住戶，房屋署在多次嘗試仍未能成功聯絡該等住戶後，將以何準則決定需否轉介其他部門跟進或報警；

（四）就未能成功聯絡住戶的個案，房屋署會否考慮在更短時間內向警方尋求協助，以決定是否向該等單位採取進一步行動（例如破門入屋）；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（五）鑑於有意見認為不同部門間若能夠加強合作，有助及早發現公屋單位內的死亡個案，甚至挽回人命，房屋署、社署、民政事務總署及警方會否考慮設立資料互通及合作機制；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（六）會否推動和鼓勵地區服務及關愛隊伍（關愛隊）、管理公司及公屋租戶設立「報平安」制度，讓獨居或有需要的公屋租戶可自願參與；

（七）鑑於房屋署正試行「長者住戶大門開關訊息系統」，為自願參與的長者住戶安裝系統，以協助長者指定的親友了解住戶進出居所的情況，當局未來會否將該計劃擴展至非長者公屋住戶；會否推動和鼓勵關愛隊及管理公司成為「指定聯絡人」之一，以便快速跟進相關住戶的情況；及

（八）鑑於香港工會聯合會與香港中華煤氣有限公司合作推出「燃點生活護聯網」計劃，利用智能煤氣錶實時觀測長者的用氣習慣，當局會否借鑒該計劃，聯同商界及社會團體推出其他計劃讓照顧者可查看長者的情況，以提升他們的家居安全？

答覆：

主席：

房屋署的屋邨管理人員會透過日常管理工作接觸公共租住房屋（公屋）租戶，主動了解他們在公屋單位的住用情況，並會特別關注獨居長者，按需要適時轉介個案予其他政府部門及社福機構以提供援助。

就黃國議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局和民政事務總署，現回覆如下：

（一）、（二）及（五）過去十年（即二○一五至二○二四年），房屋署在轄下公屋單位內錄得自然身故的個案數目載列於附件。上述的個案主要透過房屋署日常管理工作（例如巡樓、家訪、收房行動等），或由住戶的親友或鄰居等人士通知屋邨辦事處，或由其他政府部門包括警方及社會福利署（社署）或社福機構轉介發現。房屋署並沒有備存獲悉個案的途徑的分項統計數字。

現時，房屋署和社署設有跨部門的轉介機制處理公屋租戶房屋援助的特別個案，並在總部及地區層面成立聯絡小組，定期檢視和改善房屋援助個案的合作機制。房屋署亦正與勞工及福利局緊密聯繫，在保障個人資料私隱的前提下，提供公屋住戶資料，以便勞工及福利局建立資料庫跟進隱蔽及需要照顧的長者個案。

（三）及（四）根據《房屋條例》（第283章）第19（1）（b）條，當香港房屋委員會（房委會）向租戶發出「遷出通知書」，須給予租戶最少一個月期限的遷出通知終止租約。在通知期屆滿後，如佔用人仍未主動交回單位，房屋署才可按《房屋條例》派員到單位執行收回單位行動。就公屋租戶欠租而言，房屋署在發出「遷出通知書」前，會先採取一系列行動，包括透過家訪、電話或面談，與欠租租戶溝通。若仍無法聯繫欠租租戶，房屋署職員會嘗試聯絡其親友和聯絡人。而部分長者住客並沒有留下任何的親友或其他可聯絡的人士，對於這一類獨居獨身住戶，我們會盡量採用其他方式嘗試與他們接觸，包括將便條透過門縫放進單位內及放入信箱通知住戶盡快聯絡屋邨辧事處、着保安員留意住戶的進出大廈情況，以及記錄住戶的水電用量等，以更緊密的留意他們的情況。如租戶因經濟困難而欠租，房屋署可按其意願及資格，轉介其至社署跟進，或協助其申請「租金援助計劃」。若多番嘗試後仍未能聯絡租戶或其任何親友，房屋署會向其他部門查詢，例如向社署查詢租戶是否其照顧個案及最新情況；或向入境事務處查詢有關租戶的出入境紀錄等；如有需要亦會向警方尋求協助。此外，若房屋署職員在進行日常管理工作時發現可疑個案（如單位傳出異味），會即時通知警方採取適當行動，包括按情況破門入屋。

（六）、（七）及（八）為鼓勵物業管理公司及護衞服務承辦商更主動協助有需要的公屋租戶，凡投標者在競投物業管理服務合約或護衞服務合約時，能提供關懷租戶的有效建議，例如設立義工團隊，提供義工服務給邨內社區、探訪長者或有需要人士／家庭等，在評審標書時會獲得額外分數，增加其中標的機會。此外，房屋署每年舉辦「屋邨管理服務承辦商大獎」，並設有「最佳護衞員工」選舉，以嘉許在工作上有良好表現及積極協助邨內有需要住戶的服務承辦商和護衞員，藉以鼓勵他們主動關懷屋邨內的住戶。

房屋署在今年四月開始，在觀塘雲漢邨及何文田常樂邨，試行「長者住戶大門開關訊息系統」計劃，為自願參與的長者住戶安裝系統，讓他們指定的親友，掌握有關長者進出居所的情況，及時提供適切支援。房屋署會積極研究與其他政府部門及社福機構推行其他類似計劃的可行性，以推展至其他公共屋邨，惠及更多住戶。

另外，房委會亦向合資格長者住戶提供津貼安裝「平安鐘」，讓住戶遇到緊急事故時可以迅速求助。需要安裝「平安鐘」而非領取綜合社會保障援助的長者租戶，可向房委會申領緊急警報系統津貼。津貼計劃於二○二一年二月起擴展至流動設備，包括具備緊急警報系統的手機和手錶、安裝專用應用程式的智能電話及其他產品等，以便長者租戶自行選購適合的緊急警報系統。津貼計劃推行以來已批出約26000宗申請。房屋署亦已在部分屋邨的暢通易達洗手間內以試點形式安裝智能監測跌倒系統，以偵測跌倒、暈厥或停留過久等情況。

房委會轄下各公共屋邨辦事處積極協助關愛隊推展關愛活動，籌劃社區活動及為有需要的家庭（包括長者戶）提供探訪及服務等。此外，房委會各屋邨每年均夥拍非政府機構舉辦活動，活動範疇包括外展探訪，以識別獨居及隱蔽租戶，為他們提供支援服務，例如送飯服務、家居維修服務和清潔、出外就醫的接送服務等，以幫助他們維持基本生活需要、擴闊社交圈子及提供情緒支援。

房委會會繼續推行上述各項措施，並會適時作出檢討，致力配合住戶的需要。"
LCQ22: Support for public rental housing tenants,2025-07-09 16:05,2025-07-09 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900452.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Kingsley Wong and a written reply by Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

It has been learnt that a number of cases involving deaths of public rental housing (PRH) tenants in their own PRH flats occurred in Hong Kong in the past, in which the deaths of such tenants remained unknown for a long time, and there were even cases where their bodies had been reduced to skeletons by the time they were discovered; and there were also cases in which carers died suddenly in their PRH flats, but the relatives living with them were forced to ""stay with the dead bodies"" as their relatives were unable to seek assistance and report to the Police due to mental incapacity or other reasons. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of cases in each of the past 10 years, in which staff of the Housing Department (HD) found people dead in the flats concerned during home visits or flat recovery work (e.g. breaking into the flats concerned);

(2) of the number of cases in each of the past 10 years, in which the Social Welfare Department (SWD) found people dead in the flats concerned in the course of following up the welfare service matters of PRH tenants;

(3) it is learnt that, following the default on rental payment for two consecutive months by PRH tenants, HD will make several attempts to contact the tenants concerned by means of telephone, written notification or home visits, etc., of the criteria adopted by HD for determining whether it is necessary to refer the cases to other departments for follow-up or to report to the Police after repeated unsuccessful attempts to contact the tenants;

(4) regarding cases in which HD is unable to contact the tenants successfully, whether HD will consider seeking assistance from the Police within a shorter period of time, so as to decide if further actions will be taken in respect of the tenants concerned (e.g. breaking into the flats); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) as there are views that enhanced cooperation among different departments will facilitate early detection of death cases in PRH flats and even save lives, whether HD, SWD, the Home Affairs Department and the Police will consider setting up a mechanism for information sharing and cooperation; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(6) whether it will promote and encourage the District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams), management companies and PRH tenants to set up a system for assuring safety, so that PRH tenants who live alone or need relevant support may participate on a voluntary basis;

(7) given that HD has launched the pilot scheme of Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households to equip the elderly households who have voluntarily participated in the scheme with the system which allows designated relatives or friends to keep track of the movement of the elderly in and out of their flats, whether the authorities will extend the scheme to cover non-elderly PRH tenants in the future; whether they will promote and encourage the Care Teams and management companies to become one of the designated contact persons, so as to expeditiously follow up the situation of the tenants concerned; and

(8) given that the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions and the Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited have joined forces to launch the Gas Guardian Care Network programme, which utilises smart meters to monitor the gas usage patterns of the elderly in real-time, whether the authorities will make reference to the programme and launch other projects in collaboration with the business sector and community organisations to enable carers to check the condition of the elderly, so as to enhance home safety of the elderly?

Reply:

President,

The estate management staff of the Housing Department (HD) will contact public rental housing (PRH) tenants through daily management work, proactively understanding their living conditions in PRH units and will pay special attention to elderly residents living alone. Cases will be referred to other government departments and social welfare organisations as needed to provide assistance.

In response to the question raised by the Hon Kingsley Wong, in consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the Home Affairs Department, our reply is as follows:

(1), (2) and (5) In the past 10 years (i.e. 2015 to 2024), the number of natural deaths recorded in PRH units under the HD is listed in the Annex. These cases are mainly discovered through the HD's routine management work (such as patrols, home visits, flat recovery operations, etc.), or were reported by the tenants' relatives, friends, or neighbours to the estate offices, or referred by other government departments including the police and the Social Welfare Department (SWD) or social welfare organisations. The HD does not maintain statistical breakdowns of the means by which these cases are discovered.

At present, the HD and the SWD have established an inter-departmental referral mechanism to handle special cases of housing assistance for PRH tenants. Liaison groups have been formed at both the headquarters and regional levels to regularly review and improve the cooperation mechanism for housing assistance cases. The HD is also closely collaborating with the LWB and is providing information of PRH tenants under the premise of protecting personal data privacy, with a view to facilitating the LWB to develop a database for following up on hidden and needy elderly individuals.

(3) and (4) According to Section 19(1)(b) of the Housing Ordinance (Cap. 283), when the Housing Authority (HA) serves a notice-to-quit to tenant, at least one month's notice for termination of tenancy should be given. Upon expiry of the notice, if the occupier still does not voluntarily surrender the unit, the HD can then deploy staff to proceed flat recovery action in accordance with the Housing Ordinance. For rent arrears cases, a series of actions will be taken initially by the HD before serving notice-to-quit, including communicating with tenants through home visits, phone calls or face-to-face interviews. If the tenants still cannot be reached, HD staff will try to reach their relatives and emergency contacts. For some singleton elderly tenants who live by themselves and have not provided any relatives or other contact persons, we will make every effort to contact them through alternative means, including slipping notes through the door gap and into the letter box to ask the tenants to contact the estate office as soon as possible, instructing security guards to monitor the tenants' entry into and exit from the building, and recording their water and electricity consumption to more closely monitor their situation. If the tenants are in rent arrears due to financial difficulties, cases may be referred to the SWD for follow-up or be provided with assistance to apply for Rent Assistance Scheme, subject to their consent and fulfilment of eligibilities. If the tenants or any of their relatives still cannot be reached despite multiple attempts, the HD will inquire with other departments such as the SWD to check if the tenants are their care cases and their latest situation; or the Immigration Department to check the tenants' immigration records, etc.; and will seek assistance from the police if necessary. In addition, if HD staff discover suspicious cases during daily management work (e.g. unusual odours emanating from the unit), they will notify the police immediately to take appropriate action, including breaking into the unit as necessary.

(6), (7) and (8) In order to encourage property management companies and security service contractors to be more proactive in assisting PRH tenants in need, we give bidders who can provide effective suggestions for caring the tenants, e.g. establishing volunteer teams to provide volunteer services to the community in the estate and to visit the elderly or individuals/ families in need, etc., additional marks during the tender evaluation, thereby increasing their chances of winning the bid. In addition, the HD organises the annual Estate Management Services Contractor Awards and the Best Security Staff election to commend service contractors and security personnel who have performed well and actively assisted needy residents in the estate. This aims to encourage them to go the extra mile and take the initiative to care for the estates' PRH residents.

Starting from April this year, the HD launched the pilot scheme of Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households in Wan Hon Estate in Kwun Tong and Sheung Lok Estate in Ho Man Tin. The elderly households who voluntarily participate in the scheme are equipped with the system which allows designated relatives or friends to keep track of the movement of the elderly in and out of their flats so as to provide timely support when needed. The HD will actively explore the feasibility of implementing other similar schemes in collaboration with other government departments and social welfare organisations, with a view to benefitting more elderly households in other PRH estates.

In addition, the HA also provides subsidies to eligible elderly tenants for the installation of emergency alarm system (Safety Bell), allowing the tenants to seek help timely in case of emergencies. Elderly tenants who require to install Safety Bell but are not receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance can apply for the Emergency Alarm System (EAS) Grant from the HA. Since February 2021, the grant has been extended to mobile devices, including mobile phones and watches equipped with EAS, smartphones with dedicated EAS mobile app installed and other products, allowing elderly tenants to purchase suitable emergency alarm system products on their own. Since the implementation of the grant scheme, approximately 26000 applications have been approved. The HD has also installed fall detection systems in accessible toilets in some housing estates on a pilot basis to detect situations such as falls, fainting, prolonged stays, etc.

The estate offices under the HA actively assist the Care Teams in promoting care activities, organising community events and providing visits and services to families in need (including elderly households). In addition, the HA collaborates with non-governmental organisations annually to organise activities in various PRH estates. These activities include outreach visits to identify elderly singleton and hidden elders, providing them with support services such as meal delivery, home repair and cleaning services, escort service for medical appointments, etc., so as to help them maintain basic living needs, expand their social networks and provide emotional support.

The HA will continue to implement the aforementioned measures and will conduct timely reviews, striving to meet the needs of tenants."
《保障消費者防詐騙約章3.0》,2025-07-09 16:00,2025-07-09 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070800442.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 3.0,2025-07-09 16:00,2025-07-09 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070800441.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the Insurance Authority (IA) and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) today (July 9) announced the launch of the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 3.0 (the Charter 3.0). This joint effort is fully supported by the Consumer Council, the Hong Kong Association of Banks, the Hong Kong Police Force, and the Office of the Communications Authority.

Building on the success of the Charters 1.0 and 2.0, launched in 2023 and 2024 respectively, the Charter 3.0 represents a significant step forward in anti-scam actions by establishing a collaborative framework between financial regulators and technology firms and telecommunications firms in combatting financial fraud and scams targeting the Hong Kong public. The Charter 3.0 introduces six key principles (see Annex), focusing on the reporting of suspected financial fraud and scams, checking of advertisers, internal monitoring processes, enforcement of terms of service, and collaboration on public education and awareness.

During the launch event, executives from financial regulators, technology firms and telecommunications firms engaged in productive discussions on the latest trends of financial fraud and scams as well as their collaborative efforts for the common purpose of combatting such fraud and scams.

The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, said, ""The fight against financial fraud and scams and to protect the public requires a united front, bringing together the public and private sectors, as well as the community at large. The Charter 3.0 represents a significant milestone in this endeavour, harnessing the collective strength of the financial, technology, and telecommunications industries to better safeguard the public.""

The Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Ms Julia Leung,added, ""The Charter 3.0 is a meaningful step forward, bringing in major technology and telecommunications companies to join the fight against online scams. It is our shared responsibility to disrupt these threats at their source. This initiative not only echoes global governments and regulators' call to action but also positions Hong Kong as a leader in safeguarding the financial world's digital future. Together, we are building a safer, more responsible online landscape that prioritises vigilance, collaboration, and public trust.""

The Chief Executive Officer of the IA, Mr Clement Cheung,said, ""The Charter 3.0 represents the outcome of collaborative efforts made by key stakeholders in forging a robust and resilient alliance to prevent financial fraud and scams. The IA will leverage on this platform to strengthen public education and empower policy holders so that they can safeguard effectively against the increasingly sophisticated plots concocted by swindlers.""

The Managing Director of the MPFA, Mr Cheng Yan-chee,said, ""MPF is the valuable retirement reserve accumulated by the working population. The MPFA will not tolerate any fraudulent activities that undermine their retirement savings in MPF. We are pleased to see financial regulators, enforcement agencies and relevant organisations together with major technology and telecommunications companies under the Charter 3.0 stepping up efforts in combatting scams and enhancing anti-scam awareness in the community. We urge the working population to stay vigilant and join hands with us by proactively reporting suspected scams to safeguard their MPF interests."""
​立法會十題：市民擁有自置居所,2025-07-09 15:55,2025-07-09 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900414.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上洪雯議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於一九九八年發表《香港長遠房屋策略白皮書》，為提升市民擁有自置居所訂立具體指標，以期在二○○七年年底前，全港七成家庭能擁有自置居所，但政府於二○○二年因重新定位其房屋政策而放棄該目標。而政府於二○一四年公布新的《長遠房屋策略》（《策略》）後，至今也再無提出訂立家庭自置居所比率的目標。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計過去10年，每年（a）擁有自置居所的住戶數目、（b）其自置居所的類型（包括（A）私營房屋、（B）資助出售房屋，以及（C）臨時房屋），以及（c）持有按揭的住戶數目為何；如有統計，按不同年齡組別（即（i）35歲以下、（ii）35歲至45歲以下、（iii）45歲至55歲以下、（iv）55歲至65歲以下，以及（v）65歲或以上）以下表列出分項數字；如沒有統計，原因為何；

（四）目前有哪些具體措施鼓勵市民自置居所，以及有關措施的效果為何？

答覆:

主席：

香港的房屋政策一直是社會發展的重要基石。本屆政府從土地供應着手，在各環節提量、提速、提效、提質。在這三年不懈努力下，公營房屋（包括公共租住房屋（公屋）和資助出售單位）落成量已完全扭轉了「頭輕尾重」的情況。連同「簡約公屋」在內，未來五年（二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度）總體公營房屋（亦包括公屋和資助出售單位）供應量將達197 000伙，較本屆政府上任時的五年期（二○二二／二三至二○二六／二七年度）大幅增加了85%。此外，我們亦成功將輪候公屋的時間封頂，由高峰6.1年下降至5.3年。「居者有其屋計劃」（居屋）的超額認購倍數已由「居屋2019」最高的62倍大幅下降至「居屋2024」的14倍。展望未來，隨着各個公營房屋（包括公屋和資助出售單位）及「簡約公屋」項目陸續落成，公屋綜合輪候時間會逐步下降。因此，我們更有「底氣」提供更多資助出售單位，進一步滿足市民的置業需求。

現時，約一半的住戶居住在自己擁有的物業。對大部分市民而言，置業是人生重要的決定，涉及多方面的考慮，例如家庭及子女生育計劃、對更獨立的現代生活方式的追求等。對於未能負擔私樓的中低收入人士而言，資助出售單位是他們實現置業夢想非常合適的第一步，因此我們一直致力完善房屋階梯，透過提供不同種類的資助出售單位，回應不同收入家庭的置業願望，鼓勵各個階層的市民按自己的能力上進上流。

就洪雯議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局和政府統計處，我們現回覆如下：

（一）和（二）有關過去10年本港家庭住戶自置居所及相關的人口和社會經濟特徵的統計數據，可參考政府統計處「2016年中期人口統計」及「2021年人口普查」的結果。按戶主年齡組別及房屋類型劃分的自置居所家庭住戶數目列於附件一。在對上的五年間，自置居所家庭住戶數目及擁有資助出售單位的住戶數目分別上升了超過80 000戶和近30 000戶，升幅分別達6%及7%，反映更多家庭擁有了自己的物業。自置居所家庭住戶的每月收入中位數，和每月按揭供款及借貸還款中位數列於附件二。

值得注意的是，在二○一六年至二○二一年間，每個居屋銷售計劃平均只推售約4 200個單位，超額認購倍數平均高達約43倍。然而，本屆政府非常有決心解決香港的房屋問題，因此在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），除了公屋／綠表置居計劃（綠置居）單位外，香港房屋委員會（房委會）和香港房屋協會將會有約56 500個資助出售單位落成，即每年平均約11 000個單位，是本屆政府上任前的2.6倍。

（三）及（四）正如上述所言，本屆政府非常有決心解決香港的房屋問題，我們亦十分關心青年人。因此，我們推出多項政策措施，從供應、編配以及財務安排多方面協助市民（特別是青年人）實現置業夢想。自本屆政府上任以來，已有超過33 000個申請者購買資助出售單位，可見以往十多年來中低收入家庭置業難的情況，已經在本屆政府各個團隊齊心一致努力造地建屋下，被大力扭轉。隨着資助出售單位的供應未來會進一步增多，以後十年市民就更能感受到擁有自置居所後所帶來的幸福感和獲得感，更多家庭得以在這個城市安居樂業。

此外，在供應方面，行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》中已公布，房委會會調整公屋（包括綠置居）和資助出售單位的比例，由七比三逐步調整至六比四，增加資助出售單位的供應。在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），房委會和香港房屋協會將會有約56 500個資助出售單位落成。正如上述所指，我們相信由政府主導持續穩定地供應資助出售單位，可帶動整個房屋階梯的流轉，協助有需要的人士按各自的需要和能力實現置業夢想。

我們同時提出一系列政策措施，透過一套完整的「組合拳」滿足不同市民的住屋需要和訴求，包括將居屋綠白表比例由現時四比六調整至五比五，讓更多有意購買居屋的公屋租戶向上流；並透過優化銷售安排增加青年及屢次向隅者等人士購買資助出售單位的機會。

房委會已由「居屋2024」起，落實二○二三年《施政報告》公布推出的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」。在「居屋2024」新推售單位中，預留約四成單位作配額（即2 900個單位），供參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」和「家有長者優先選樓計劃」的合資格申請者攪珠和優先選樓。在「居屋2024」申請期內，房委會共收到約106 000份申請表，其中約50 000份屬家庭申請者，當中參加「家有長者優先選樓計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」的申請共有約19 000份，佔家庭申請者約四成。未能在「居屋2024」中成功選購單位的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」合資格家庭，只要他們的子女在日後推出的資助出售單位銷售計劃的申請截止日期時為三歲或以下，仍可參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」而獲優先選樓。此外，房委會繼「綠置居2024」後，亦會由下一期居屋銷售計劃開始，為前兩次曾連續向隅而未能成功購買單位的申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼，以增加他們成功購買資助出售單位的機會。參考「居屋2024」的數字，假設一切因素（包括申請者人數、年齡等）不變，屢次向隅的合資格「家有初生優先選樓計劃」家庭在獲得額外一個抽籤號碼後，購買單位的成功率將提升約60%。

房委會亦一直在定價及財務安排等方面協助中低收入家庭置業。首先，政府在二○一八年修訂了資助出售單位的定價機制。資助出售單位定價是以申請人的負擔能力為計算基礎，與私人房屋市場脫鈎。在現時定價機制下，至少75%推售的單位，可讓入息水平達家庭每月入息中位數的非業主住戶家庭，動用不超過其每月入息40%作按揭供款。若以負擔能力計算的售價與評定市值比較，最新一期的綠置居及居屋分別等於以評定市值的六折及七折出售。

另外，房委會於二○二四年放寬資助出售單位的按揭貸款安排，包括將按揭保證期由最長30年延長至最長50年，及將按揭還款期由最長25年延長至最長30年，以便一、二手買家向參與提供該等單位按揭貸款的銀行和認可財務機構取得按揭貸款。在有關安排落實後，剩餘按揭保證期超過十年的居屋／綠置居單位由約14%大幅增至約98%。截至二○二五年五月，二手資助出售單位平均每月成交宗數約360宗，比落實前12個月的平均每月成交宗數約230宗，顯著上升約六成。此外，第二市場按揭還款期由最長25年延長至最長30年後，於第二市場購買資助出售單位而申請按揭的買家當中，有超過一半以上的個案的還款期為25年或以上。由此可反映以上措施成功活化第二市場和促進第二市場資助出售單位的流轉。

在第二市場方面，房委會亦已由「白表居屋第二市場計劃（白居二）2024」起，大幅增加1 500個配額至6 000個，並將新增配額全數撥予40歲以下的青年家庭及一人申請者。「白居二2024」的所有申請中，超過八成，即約28 000份申請為選擇參加「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者，反映有關計劃深受青年人歡迎。

此外，政府亦透過「港人首次置業」（「首置」）項目，協助既不符合申請居屋資格、又未能負擔私營房屋的較高收入人士，回應他們的置業期望。除了市區重建局首兩個已推售的「首置」項目（即「煥然懿居」第一和第二座，以及「煥然懿居」第三座）共售出超過600個「首置」單位，政府正推展另外數個「首置」項目，於未來數年起合共提供約5 000個「首置」單位。而過去所推售「首置」單位的申請人以及最終買家，有大約八成半是40歲或以下青年。我們相信這項措施可以協助另外一批收入較高但仍未能負擔私營房屋的中層青年人置業，給他們更多不同的選擇。

因應整體樓市情況的變化，本屆政府自二○二四年二月起撤銷所有住宅物業需求管理措施；香港金融管理局亦自二○二四年十月起修訂了物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將最高物業按揭成數和「供款與入息比率」上限回復至二○○九年開始實施逆周期措施以前的水平，即不論物業價值，按揭成數上限一律調整至七成，供款與入息比率上限一律調整為五成，便利不同置業需要的人士。個別人士更可按自身需要，透過按揭保險計劃借取高成數的按揭貸款，其中有固定收入的首次置業人士購置價格為1,000萬港元或以下的物業，按揭成數可高達九成，大大減輕首期負擔。

此外，為減輕購買較低價值物業人士的負擔，政府自二○二五年二月二十六日起調整買賣或轉讓住宅及非住宅物業須繳付的從價印花稅的稅階，將徵收100元物業印花稅適用的物業價值上限由300萬元提高至400萬元，對有意置業的人士有一定幫助。就資助出售單位而言，絕大部分定價都低於400萬元，買家已能受惠於上述印花稅降至100元的措施，最多可以節省達五萬九千多元。而根據稅務局的資料，在二○二五年三月至五月，住宅物業價值在300萬元以上至400萬元之間加蓋印花的買賣合約宗數共3 780宗，相比去年同期（二○二四年三月至五月）的2 183宗，顯著上升了超過七成之多。

我們會繼續按物業市場的發展、不同市民的置業需求等各項因素，持續檢視各項安排是否有優化的空間。"
LCQ10: Home ownership by public,2025-07-09 15:55,2025-07-09 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900439.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 The Government published A White Paper on Long Term Housing Strategy in Hong Kong in 1998, formulating specific indicators to enhance home ownership by the public, with a view to achieving a home ownership rate of 70 per cent by 2007. However, the Government abandoned this target as it re-positioned its housing policy in 2002. Following the announcement of the new Long Term Housing Strategy (LTHS) in 2014, the Government has not set any targets for the home ownership rate for households to date. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics for each year over the past 10 years on (a) the number of owner-occupied households, (b) the type of their owner-occupied flats (including (A) private housing, (B) subsidised sale flats, and (C) temporary housing), and (c) the number of households having mortgages; if so, set out in the table below a breakdown by age group (i.e. aged (i) below 35, (ii) 35 to below 45, (iii) 45 to below 55, (iv) 55 to below 65, and (v) 65 or above); if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics for each year over the past 10 years on the median monthly income and the median value of monthly mortgage repayment of local owner-occupied households; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as there are views that home ownership can enhance people's sense of belonging to community and foster strong work values, but according to a research brief published by the Legislative Council Secretariat in March 2021 and data from the Census and Statistics Department, the overall local home ownership rate and the home ownership rate among young people aged below 35 have both declined in recent years, whether the authorities will consider setting a home ownership rate afresh in LTHS in the future; if not, of the reasons for that; and

(4) of the specific measures that are currently in place to encourage home ownership in the community, and the effects of such measures?

Reply:

President,

 Hong Kong's housing policy has all along been an important cornerstone of social development. The current-term Government put in place measures to enhance quantity, speed, efficiency and quality in land production. With our unremitting efforts in the past three years, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply (including public rental housing (PRH) and subsidised sale flats (SSF)) has completely turned around. Coupled with Light Public Housing (LPH), the total public housing supply (including also PRH and SSF) in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is a significant increase of 85 per cent as compared with the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27). In addition, we have successfully capped the waiting time for PRH, which has reduced from the peak of 6.1 years to 5.3 years. The oversubscription rate of Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) has also dropped from the peak of 62 times in HOS 2019 to 14 times in HOS 2024. Looking ahead, with the completion of various public housing (including PRH and SSF) as well as LPH projects, the Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing will gradually decline. Therefore, we have more confidence to provide more SSF to further meet the home ownership aspiration of the public.

 Currently, about half of the households are residing in accommodations that they own. For most people, buying a property is a major life decision involving many considerations, such as family and childbearing plans as well as the pursuit of a more independent and modern lifestyle, etc. For low- to middle-income persons who cannot afford private housing, SSF is a very suitable first step in realising their dream of home ownership. In this regard, we have all along been striving to enhance the housing ladder through the provision of various types of SSF in response to the home ownership aspiration of households with different income and encourage citizens from all walks of life to move up the social ladder according to their abilities.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), our reply to the questions raised by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong is as follows:

(1) and (2) Results of the 2016 Population By-census and the 2021 Population Census conducted by C&SD provide statistics regarding home ownership and related demographic and socio-economic characteristics of Hong Kong's domestic households in the past decade. The number of owner-occupier domestic households by age group of household head and type of housing are listed in Annex 1. Over the past five years, the number of owner-occupier households and households owning SSF increased by over 80 000 and nearly 30 000 respectively, representing growth rates of 6 per cent and 7 per cent. This reflects a rising trend of homeownership among families. The median monthly income and the median mortgage payment and loan repayment of owner-occupier domestic households are listed in Annex 2.

 It is worth noting that between 2016 and 2021, only an average of about 4 200 flats were put up for sale under each HOS sale exercise, and the oversubscription rate was as high as about 43 times on average. However, the current-term Government is very determined to tackle the housing problem in Hong Kong. As a result, in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), in addition to PRH/Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH) flats, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HS) will have a completion of about 56 500 SSF, averaging about 11 000 units annually. This is 2.6 times of the annual output before the current-term Government took office.

(3) and (4) As stated above, the current-term Government is very determined to resolve housing problem in Hong Kong and we also care about our young people. Therefore, we have introduced a number of policy measures to assist citizens (especially young people) in realising their home ownership aspiration through various aspects, such as supply, allocation and financial arrangements. Since the current-term Government took office, more than 33 000 applicants have purchased SSF, and the difficulties faced by low- and middle-income families in acquiring their own properties over the past decade or so have been clearly reversed by the concerted efforts of the various teams of the current-term Government in providing more land and housing. With the increasing supply of SSF in the coming years, more residents will experience the happiness and sense of fulfillment brought by homeownership over the next decade, enabling more families to settle securely and thrive in our city.

 In addition, in terms of supply, the Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HA would adjust the ratio between PRH (including GSH units) and SSF to gradually adjust the ratio from 7:3 to 6:4 in order to increase the supply of SSF. In the next five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), the HA and the HS will complete about 56 500 SSF. As stated above, we believe that a continuous and stable supply of SSF led by the Government is conducive to the upward mobility along the housing ladder and it will help those in need realise their dream of owning a home according to their respective needs and abilities.

 At the same time, we have also proposed a series of policy measures to meet the housing needs and demands of different citizens, including revising the ratio between Green Form and White Form in respect of HOS flats from the current 4:6 to 5:5 so as to allow more PRH tenants who would like to purchase HOS flats to move upwards; and increasing the chance of young people and applicants who have made repeated attempts to purchase SSF by optimising the sales arrangements.

 Starting from HOS 2024, the HA has implemented the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme which was announced in the 2023 Policy Address. A quota of about 40 per cent of the new flats for sale (i.e. 2 900 flats) under HOS 2024 were set aside for eligible applicants under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme and the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members for balloting and priority flat selection. During the application period of HOS 2024, the HA received a total of around 106 000 applications. Among them, around 50 000 came from family applicants, in which around 19 000 applied under the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members and Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme, representing around 40 per cent of family applicants. If eligible families applying under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme fail to purchase a flat under HOS 2024, they may still apply under the Scheme for priority flat selection as long as their children are aged three or below on the closing day of the application of subsequent SSF sale exercises. In addition, following GSH 2024, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to applicants who had failed to purchase a flat in the last two consecutive sale exercises starting from the next HOS exercise, so as to increase their chances of success in purchasing SSF. Based on the figures of HOS 2024, assuming all factors remain constant (including the number of applicants, their age, etc), the success rate of eligible families applying under the of Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme in purchasing a flat will increase by about 60 per cent, after obtaining an extra ballot number.

 The HA has also been assisting low- to middle-income families in purchasing homes through pricing and financial arrangements. First of all, the Government revised the pricing mechanism of SSF in 2018. The pricing of SSF is calculated on the basis of applicants' affordability, which is delinked from the private housing market. Under the current pricing mechanism, at least 75 per cent of the flats for sale can allow non-owner occupier households earning the median monthly household income to spend no more than 40 per cent of their monthly income on mortgage payment. Based on affordability calculations, the selling prices of the flats offered under latest GSH and HOS sale exercises were set at 60 per cent and 70 per cent of their assessed market value respectively.

 On top of this, the HA relaxed mortgage arrangements for SSF in 2024, including extending the maximum mortgage default guarantee from 30 years to 50 years and extending the maximum mortgage repayment period from 25 years to 30 years to enable purchasers of first-hand and second-hand SSF to obtain mortgage loans from banks and authorised financial institutions participating in the provision of mortgage loans for such flats. After the implementation of relevant arrangements, the number of HOS/GSH flats with a residual guarantee period of more than 10 years increased substantially from about 14 per cent to about 98 per cent. As at May 2025, the average number of transactions of second-hand SSF was about 360 per month, which was about 60 per cent higher than the average number of transactions of about 230 per month in the 12 months before the implementation. Besides, after extending the maximum mortgage repayment period for flats sold under the secondary market from 25 years to 30 years, among buyers who applied for mortgages to purchase SSF in the secondary market, more than half of the cases have a repayment period of 25 years or more. This shows that the above measures have successfully revitalised the secondary market and facilitated the turnover of SSF in the secondary market.

 For the secondary market, starting from White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) 2024, the HA has also significantly increased the quota by 1 500 to 6 000, all of which will be allocated to young family applicants and one-person applicants aged below 40. Of all the applications for WSM 2024, more than 80 per cent (i.e. about 28 000 applications) were from young applicants who chose to participate in Youth Scheme (WSM), reflecting that the scheme is well received by young people.

 In addition, the Government also responds to the home ownership aspirations of higher-income persons who are not eligible for the HOS and yet cannot afford private housing through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below. We believe that this initiative may help another batch of youngsters from the middle class with higher income yet still cannot afford private housing achieve home ownership with more available options.

 Having regard to changes in the overall situation of the property market, the current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden.

 Furthermore, to ease the burden on buyers of properties at lower values, the Government has since 26 February 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million and $4 million, facilitating those who wish to purchase flats. As most SSF units are priced below $4 million, buyers may benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings up to over $59 000. According to the information from the Inland Revenue Department, there were 3 780 duly stamped sale and purchase agreements for residential properties valued between $3 million and $4 million from March to May 2025, which represents a significant increase of over 70 per cent as compared to the same period last year (March to May 2024) where 2 183 sale and purchase agreements were duly stamped.

 We will continue to review whether there is room to optimise various relevant arrangements having regard to factors including developments of the property market, the home ownership needs of different citizens, etc."

立法會：房屋局局長動議二讀《簡樸房條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-07-09 15:35,2025-07-09 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900601.htm,"以下是房屋局局長何永賢今日（七月九日）在立法會會議動議二讀《簡樸房條例草案》的發言全文：

主席：

我謹動議二讀《簡樸房條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

香港是一個國際大都會，多年來在社會、經濟、民生發展方面都取得顯著成就。我們期盼香港在繁榮發展的過程中，市民能夠分享當中的成果。但香港過去一段長時間在土地發展過程中受到不同的阻礙，引致房屋供應不足，這個困局導致部分市民被迫居住於環境惡劣的分間單位，俗稱「劏房」，這些苦不堪言的情況是我們不忍心見到的，尤其是老人家、小朋友和身體健康有問題的基層市民。

就此，本屆政府自上任以來採取實際行動，切實地排解民生憂難，推出多項創新、突破的房屋政策，過去三年的努力得以扭轉房屋供應不足的困境，為居於不適切居所的市民提供更多選擇，幫助他們盡快改善生活環境，包括持續「提速、提量、提效、提質」，大幅增加公營房屋，包括出租公屋和資助出售房屋的供應、突破性地推出「簡約公屋」、持續推展過渡性房屋等。這些措施都令輪候公屋的「劏房」戶可更快「上樓」，為解決「劏房」問題提供實際的空間和「底氣」。根據統計處及我們進行的調研，全港有約十一萬個分間單位，其中約七成多的情況並不是大家常常在媒體報道中見到那樣惡劣的，七成多當中很多都有窗、有獨立廁所及大於八平方米；預計只有約三成左右住戶居於較為劣質的「劏房」，這些住戶不僅面對擁擠的生活環境，亦要承受單位內結構安全、消防安全，以及衞生問題等風險。作為負責任的政府，我們積極面對社會這個「痛點」，為全面有序解決劣質「劏房」這個「老大難」問題籌謀對策。

行政長官在二○二三年成立「解決劏房問題」工作組，就全面處理「劏房」問題進行深入調研和提出建議方案。經考慮工作組的報告後，行政長官在去年《施政報告》宣布以立法方式制訂全新的「簡樸房」規管制度，日後住宅分間單位必須符合最低標準，並獲認證為「簡樸房」方可合法出租，以確保分間單位提供合理和安全的居住環境。

房屋局在去年十二月就「簡樸房」規管制度進行了為期約兩個月的持份者諮詢，並分別在去年十二月和今年三月諮詢了立法會房屋事務委員會。立法會議員和持份者普遍認同「簡樸房」規管制度的框架。現時的立法方案已反映了諮詢期間收到的主要意見，包括就政府收取的認證費用提供「早鳥」減免優惠，即早登記早申請的話，費用就可以全免、寬容處理在「簡樸房」登記申請期間被發現遲交分間單位租賃管制下所要求的「租賃通知書」（表格AR2）、放寬登記資格、延長寬限期、放寬窗戶要求，以及增加可進行核證的專業人士範疇等。在此，我衷心感謝各持份者提供貼近民情和合乎現實情況的寶貴意見。

《條例草案》旨在為落實「簡樸房」條例規管制度提供法律依據，訂明住宅樓宇分間單位須符合關於內部面積不少於八平方米，以及樓底淨高度、消防安全、結構安全、照明及通風、廁所、供水點和水電錶，合共八個範疇的居住環境最低標準，並取得「簡樸房」認證，方可合法出租作居住用途。

作為落實「簡樸房」規管制度的過渡安排，《條例草案》會由明年三月一日起生效計，提供48個月的過渡期。這包括由二○二六年三月一日起推展為期12個月的登記制度，讓現存分間單位先進行登記，便可取得由二○二七年三月一日起計為期36個月的寬限期至二○三○年二月二十八日，以逐步進行改造工程和申請「簡樸房」認證。同時，《條例草案》會訂明寬限期屆滿前六個月為倒數期，即二○二九年九月一日至二○三○年二月二十八日，其間禁止已登記但沒有有效認證的分間單位訂立新租賃，以「倒迫」的方法令分間單位的營運者盡快進行改造工程或認證申請，而不是拖延至寬限期的最後一刻。

確立「簡樸房」規管制度，會為市場經營出租分間單位提供清晰的法定標準和要求，新進場的營運者遵從有關標準後便可合法經營，而現有營運者可透過在寬限期內，安排逐步改造糾正，以符合法例要求，使分間單位的供應長遠可以在合理安全的前提下，滿足市場需求。在推行「簡樸房」規管制度的過程中，劣質「劏房」會逐漸被市場淘汰，或在日後的執法行動中被取締。

為達致一定的阻嚇作用，《條例草案》會訂明非法出租的相關罪行，包括：在登記期結束後，即由二○二七年三月一日開始，住宅單位內有兩個或以上的分間單位獨立出租作住宅用途，但沒有有效登記及「簡樸房」認證，相關營運者即屬違法；以及在倒數期期間，即二○二九年九月一日至二○三○年二月二十八日，將已登記但沒有有效「簡樸房」認證的分間單位在倒數期內簽定新租約作住用用途，相關營運者亦屬違法。

視乎違法行為的嚴重程度和個別案情，上述營運者一經定罪，最高可處罰款三十萬元及監禁三年，而刑事責任不會涉及租客。

縱使現存分間單位的質素有非常惡劣的，但也有較優質的，以滿足社會上不同的居住需要。畢竟現時全港有約十一萬住宅樓宇分間單位，涉及約二十二萬名居民，政府會以務實、以民為本的宗旨，並配合未來「簡樸房」及公營房屋的供應，在登記期完結後，即二○二七年三月一日起，有序地對違法出租無登記及無認證的分間單位，採取執法行動。

為確保受影響的分間單位住戶不會流離失所，政府會透過社工隊協助他們尋找其他居所搬遷，亦會靈活調配房屋資源，如過渡性房屋、臨時收容中心、中轉房屋等，為有需要的住戶暫時提供安置。考慮到部分居於分間單位的住戶並不符合公屋申請資格，房屋局最近提出在過渡性房屋新增「丙類租戶」類別，為受「簡樸房」規管條例下的執法行動、改造工程等影響、並且有迫切安置需要，以及通過社工隊小心評估的分間單位住戶，提供短暫居所。然而，我們必須再次清楚強調，即使受影響住戶正輪候傳統公屋，他們不會因執法行動而獲提早編配公屋單位，以免對其他輪候公屋人士造成不公平。

房屋局會全力配合立法會的審議工作，爭取立法會盡快通過《條例草案》，以期二○二六年三月一日推行「簡樸房」規管制度，為告別劣質「劏房」踏出具有重大意義的一步。

要全面告別劣質「劏房」，我們必須要有破釜沉舟的決心。作為「解決劏房問題」工作組的組長及副組長，黃偉綸副司長和我過去多次透過探訪分間單位的住戶、與持份者交流，並持續與政府不同部門理順和協調「簡樸房」規管制度的方案，我們深深體會到劣質「劏房」問題的複雜性和迫切性。在行政長官和財政司副司長的帶領下，加上社會各界普遍支持「簡樸房」規管制度，我相信香港必定能逐步走出劣質「劏房」問題的困境，讓社會上所有人，包括最基層市民，都能在合理、安全的生活環境下活得有尊嚴、有自信，可以好好地和他們的家人一起在社會上籌劃更美好的未來。

我謹此陳辭。多謝主席。"
立法會九題：規管醫療器械,2025-07-09 15:30,2025-07-09 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900329.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上林哲玄議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

目前本港僅設自願性的「醫療器械行政管理制度」（該制度），並未立法規管。另一方面，據悉有商戶在網上宣傳及推銷平行進口隱形眼鏡，但該等產品的包裝盒上沒有醫療儀器標籤，或標籤有改動痕跡（例如「唯一識別標籤」被剪去或遮蓋），以致難以辨認產品是否屬有問題批次，品質無從保證。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於在該制度下隱形眼鏡屬第II級醫療器械，政府就隱形眼鏡產品所實施的進口及銷售（包括網上銷售）管制為何；

（二）過去三年政府接獲有關平行進口隱形眼鏡的舉報及求助數目，以及該等個案的分類（例如包裝標籤不當、用後感到不適等）為何；有否對擅自改動隱形眼鏡（包括平行進口隱形眼鏡）包裝資訊的商人採取執法行動；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於政府於去年六月表示，正全面檢討醫療器械的擬議立法架構，政府會否就規管醫療器械的製造、進口、質量檢定、銷售和售後跟進之修例工作訂立明確時間表；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就林哲玄議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局、香港海關和衞生署後，醫務衞生局現綜合回覆如下：

香港現時尚未訂立專門法例規管醫療器械，惟視乎有關產品的特性和特點，一些產品已受現行法例規管，如《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章）、《消費品安全條例》（第456章）及《商品說明條例》（第362章）等。

為保障公眾健康，衞生署自二○○四年起參考全球協調醫療器械規管專責小組（現為國際醫療器械監管機構論壇）的建議，設立自願性的「醫療器械行政管理制度」（「管理制度」），推行醫療器械及貿易商的表列制度，以及產品推出市場後的監察系統。

按照現時的「管理制度」，隱形眼鏡通常獲分類為第II級（中低風險）的一般醫療器械；如需在「管理制度」下表列，須獲證明能符合國際間採納的「醫療器械安全和性能基本原則」要求。至於貿易商（包括本地負責人、本地製造商、進口商及分銷商）的表列制度方面，貿易商亦須符合相關要求，包括持有有效商業登記證、維持供應醫療器械的品質管制系統，以至遵從產品推出市面後的管制，為醫療器械的安全負上責任。除此以外，「管理制度」設有呈報系統，專責處理與已表列醫療器械相關的事件報告，以期及早發現安全警號，提高對使用者的保障。

另一方面，香港海關負責執行《消費品安全條例》及《商品說明條例》。在香港供應予私人使用的消費品，如不受其他法例規管，其產品安全受《消費品安全條例》及其附屬法例《消費品安全規例》規管，包括提問所述的隱形眼鏡。

《消費品安全條例》規定製造商、進口商及供應商須確保其供應的消費品合乎合理的安全程度；而《消費品安全規例》規定就消費品的包裝或標籤上的警示或警告，須以中文及英文表達，並且必須清楚可讀。至於《商品說明條例》涵蓋貨品及服務，禁止商戶對消費者作出某些不良營商手法，包括虛假商品說明、誤導性遺漏、具威嚇性的營業行為、餌誘式廣告宣傳、先誘後轉銷售行為及不當地接受付款，對實體及網上商戶的營業行為同樣適用。

由二○二二年至二○二四年，香港海關並無接獲隱形眼鏡產品安全的投訴，惟接獲六宗涉嫌違反《商品說明條例》的投訴。經調查後，五宗投訴因證據不足而予以結案，餘下一宗個案仍在調查中。

展望將來，衞生署已公布於二○二六年年底成立「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」，而規管醫療器械將納入其工作範疇。政府現正全力推進相關立法準備工作，因應近年國際間規管醫療器械的最新趨勢，全面檢討擬議立法架構，預計明年向立法會提交立法建議，配合中心的成立時間表。一經立法，日後所有在港供應的醫療器械，如非獲豁免均須註冊，以確保符合安全、品質和性能的相關標準。"
LCQ9: Regulation of medical devices,2025-07-09 15:30,2025-07-09 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900330.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon David Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

  At present, Hong Kong has only put in place a voluntary Medical Device Administrative Control System (the System), and there is no legislation to regulate such devices. On the other hand, it is learnt that some merchants are promoting and marketing parallel-imported contact lenses on the Internet, but these products do not have any medical device labelling on their packaging boxes, or the labelling shows signs of alteration (e.g. ""the unique device identifier"" has been cut off or covered), thus making it difficult to identify whether the products belong to problematic batches, and the quality of such products cannot be guaranteed. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that contact lenses is a class II medical device under the system, of the Government's control over the importation and sale (including online sale) of contact lens products;

(2) of the number of reports and requests for assistance received by the Government in the past three years in relation to parallel-imported contact lenses, as well as the categories of such cases (e.g. improper packaging labels, discomfort after use, etc.); whether it has taken law enforcement actions against merchants who have made unauthorised alterations to the packaging information of contact lenses (including parallel-imported contact lenses); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as the Government indicated in June last year that it was conducting a comprehensive review of the proposed legislative framework for medical device regulation, whether the Government will draw up a concrete timetable for introducing legislative amendments to regulate the manufacture, importation, quality assurance, sale and post-sale follow-up of medical devices; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) and the Department of Health (DH), the Health Bureau provides a consolidated reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon David Lam as follows:

  While there is not yet specific legislation to regulate medical devices in Hong Kong, some products are already regulated by existing pieces of legislation, such as the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138), the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance (CGSO) (Cap. 456) and the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO) (Cap. 362) etc., depending on the characteristics and features of the products concerned.

  To safeguard public health, the DH has made reference to the recommendation of the Global Harmonization Task Force (now known as the International Medical Device Regulators Forum) and introduced the voluntary Medical Device Administrative Control System (MDACS) since 2004, under which a listing system for medical devices and traders as well as a post-market monitoring system for the products are put in place. 

  According to the prevailing MDACS, contact lenses are usually categorised as Class II (low-moderate risk) general medical devices. To apply for listing under the MDACS, a medical device must be proven to have met the requirements under the Essential Principles of Safety and Performance of Medical Devices that are adopted internationally. As for the listing system for traders (including local responsible person, local manufacturers, importers and distributors), traders must meet relevant requirements including holding a valid business registration certificate, maintaining a quality management system for supply of medical devices, and complying with post-market control for the products in order to hold them accountable for the safety of medical devices. Besides, a dedicated reporting system has been set up under the MDACS to handle the reporting of incidents pertaining to listed medical devices, with a view to enhancing protection for users via early detection of safety alerts.

  On the other hand, the C&ED is responsible for enforcing the CGSO and the TDO. The safety of consumer goods which are supplied for private use in Hong Kong, if not covered by other legislation, is subject to the regulation of the CGSO and its subsidiary legislation namely the Consumer Goods Safety Regulation (CGSR). This covers contact lenses as mentioned in the question.

  Pursuant to the CGSO, manufacturers, importers and suppliers should ensure that the consumer goods they supply are reasonably safe. The CGSR stipulates that any warning or caution marked on the package of consumer goods must be in both the English and the Chinese languages in a legible and conspicuous manner. Covering both goods and services, the TDO prohibits specified unfair trade practices deployed by traders against consumers, including false trade descriptions, misleading omissions, aggressive commercial practices, bait advertising, bait-and-switch and wrongly accepting payment, which are applicable to the commercial practices of both physical and online traders.

  From 2022 to 2024, the C&ED did not receive any complaint on the product safety of contact lenses, but received six complaints of suspected contravention of the TDO. Upon investigation, five cases were closed due to insufficient evidence, with the remaining one under investigation.

  Looking ahead, the DH has announced the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) by the end of 2026, with regulation of medical devices as part of its purview. The Government is taking forward preparatory work for the relevant legislation at full steam having regard to the latest international trends in regulation of medical devices in recent years, and will comprehensively review the proposed legislative framework. It is expected that the legislative proposal could be submitted to the Legislative Council within the next year so as to dovetail with the timetable for establishing the CMPR. Upon legislation, all medical devices supplied in Hong Kong, unless otherwise exempted, must be registered, thereby ensuring the compliance with relevant standards in safety, quality and performance."
政務司副司長出席「IMPACTable」同桌同餐　星展隨行軟餐品嚐午宴致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-07-09 15:29,2025-07-09 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900376.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（七月九日）出席「IMPACTable」同桌同餐星展隨行軟餐品嚐午宴的致辭：

王首毅總領事（新加坡駐香港總領事王首毅）、陳文宜行政總裁（香港社會服務聯會行政總裁）、陳依依董事總經理（星展銀行（香港）董事總經理兼集團推廣策略及傳訊部主管）、鍾凌峰營運總監（稻香集團營運總監）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位老友記：

  大家好！今天很高興出席星展基金會「IMPACTable」軟餐試食活動。感謝星展基金會、在座的業界領袖及所有參加者，以實際行動讓更多朋友認識軟餐食品，為市場創造銀髮商機。

銀髮經濟涵蓋的層面非常廣泛，包括衣食住行、健康護理、休閒娛樂、金融服務等。面對人口結構轉變的新形勢，我們必須積極應對，並在挑戰中抓緊發展機遇。此所以行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》提出成立促進銀髮經濟工作組（工作組），由我出任組長。

根據政府統計處的統計調查數據並按通脹調整，二○二四年60歲或以上長者的估算每月消費開支，除住屋開支外，食品開支佔最大部分，達26%（約3,100元），可見銀髮飲食市場的潛力龐大。為此，工作組於五月底就五大範疇公布的30項措施中，多項正正與推動銀髮友善飲食有關，包括：推出「老友記‧食好啲」活動，帶動飲食業界提供適合長者的餐膳體驗和飲食優惠；商經局（商務及經濟發展局）亦聯同香港社會服務聯會（社聯）支援商界推廣「照護食」的標準；以及推動食品製造業界提供迎合長者需要及喜好的預先包裝食品等。其中，應商經局邀請，工商組織於上個月舉行「銀髮經濟研討會」，來自不同領域的專家與業界分享銀髮市場潛力及實踐經驗，鼓勵食品製造商創造更多銀髮友善食品，促進行業的整體發展。

工作組自成立以來已開展推動軟食的工作，例如在「照護食」方面，去年十一月，我見證由社聯和香港中華廠商聯合會簽署「照護食灣區標準」合作備忘錄，助力業界研發更多不同口味的「照護食」。我很高興知道今年內應該可將「照護食」正式納入「灣區標準」清單，成為第一個由香港業界提出及制定的銀髮經濟領域「灣區標準」。

我亦樂見在工作組的帶領和推動下，商界因應銀髮一族的需要相繼推出長者友善餐飲和優惠，並與不同機構合作，籌備一連串推廣活動，將軟餐的概念在社區廣泛宣傳。今日的活動便是一個非常好例子。

我很支持星展基金會資助The Project Futurus成立「同桌同餐吞嚥友善餐廳計劃」，致力發展及推廣咀嚼及吞嚥友善的飲食文化，協助志同道合的餐廳添置製作軟餐的設備、提供專業培訓，甚至共同設計及改良餐單。

我亦感謝稻香集團參與計劃，於旗下四間鍾菜館推出「同桌同餐吞嚥友善饗宴」，涵蓋九道色、香、味俱全的經典中式美饌 ，為有咀嚼及吞嚥困難人士提供安全且優質的精緻用餐選擇。我知道鍾菜館更安排「同桌同餐大使」駐場，協助顧客點選菜單，銀色產品和服務都做足100分。

各位，銀髮經濟市場龐大，消費群體不只本地的老友記，更包括海內外的年長旅客。發展銀髮經濟不僅關乎長者的福祉，更有利商界拓展銷售，推動社會的可持續發展。我們需要社會各界積極協作與行動，才能實現銀髮經濟的最大效應。我期待各界陸續推出各項惠及銀髮一族的措施，把握銀髮經濟帶來的機遇，共同努力提升銀髮的生活質量及推動本港經濟發展。

最後，祝大家用餐愉快，每一口美食都為你帶來健康和滿足。多謝大家。"
立法會五題：法律科技及人工智能的應用,2025-07-09 15:25,2025-07-09 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900441.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳曼琪議員的提問和署理律政司司長張國鈞博士的答覆：

問題：

據悉律政司一直積極推動法律界提升對法律科技，以及人工智能（AI）的應用。有意見認為政府應積極研發於普通法領域應用AI工具（例如由香港生成式人工智能研發中心所研發的大語言模型），以提高法律界的運作效率及競爭力。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）目前有否研發應用於普通法領域的大語言模型；如有，具體詳情及推展時間表為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）有否計劃定期與內地舉辦法律科技及AI高峰論壇或國際展覽，以促進內地與香港在法律科技上的交流合作；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；有否計劃引進內地的法律科技將之應用於香港普通法領域，並助力內地在法律方面的AI服務產品拓展至香港及海外；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）有何措施確保香港中小型律師事務所能受惠於法律科技及AI的發展，例如提供技術支援、設立「法律科技設備」免稅額，以及資助其購置法律科技相關設備？

答覆：

主席：

（一）由香港科技大學牽頭的跨校合作研究中心──香港生成式人工智能研發中心（HKGAI）已開發了香港首個基於DeepSeek模型進行全參數微調的本地人工智能大語言模型「HKGAI V1」。HKGAI基於該本地大語言模型開發了多個適用於不同公務領域的垂直應用，包括生成式人工智能文書輔助應用程式「港文通」，以及與法律相關的「港法通」。律政司現正參與「港文通」的試用計劃，並會在檢討成效之後積極考慮參與「港法通」的試用。與此同時，香港中文大學法律學院最近亦與人工智能軟件公司合作，在粵語大模型的基礎上共同開發法律資訊AI模型，推動法律制度和行業的數碼化轉型。而香港理工大學孵化企業智法數科（WiseLaw Digital Technology）最近亦發布了其人工智能賦能法律產學研創新成果。律政司將根據試用成果、市場科技發展、法律業界及社會需求，以及相關資源配置等因素，與HKGAI及其他相關政府部門或機構展開合作，致力研究及推動人工智能在法律領域的進一步應用，尤其是與香港法律相關的大型語言模型。

（二）律政司十分重視法律科技及人工智能領域的發展，並認為舉辦相關論壇或展覽是促進交流合作的重要平台。目前，律政司正積極籌備相關活動，目標是今年內舉辦首個大型活動，面向全球海內外的參與者，打造一個多元開放的交流平台，促進各地智慧與經驗的共享。

目前，我們留意到內地有不少法律科技企業發展成熟。由於內地法律科技現時主要針對內地法律體系設計，未必能簡單直接地引入香港的普通法市場。然而，我們非常鼓勵內地法律科技企業落戶香港開拓本地法律市場，開發提供適合香港普通法市場的AI產品，並利用香港作為跳板開拓海外其他普通法地區的市場。

（三）為推動法律科技的發展，律政司於二○二五年一月正式成立推動法律科技發展諮詢小組（諮詢小組），邀請業界及各方持份者共同研究和制訂有關法律科技的政策措施。諮詢小組成員涵蓋法律及爭議解決業界、法律學院及法律科技業界等，當中亦有中小型律師事務所的代表，確保政策能符合業界的需要。

諮詢小組特別關注到中小型律師事務所在推動法律科技應用上的挑戰。除經濟因素外，我們理解中小型律師事務所普遍對法律科技的認識不足，且傳統執業模式較少依賴科技，影響了他們採用新技術的意願。

針對此情況，律政司接納了諮詢小組的建議，計劃分三階段，循序漸進推動法律界應用科技：

（1）第一階段：法律科技的認識和教育

推動法律科技政策的首個階段目標是要提高法律業界對法律科技的認識，並了解應用法律科技可為業界帶來的好處及應具備的風險管理意識，藉以改變業內一些固有思維模式及習慣。為此，律政司現正舉辦一系列與法律科技相關的圓桌會議和活動，以提高業界對法律科技的認識，並促進法律業界和法律科技專家交流和分享，令業界能夠規劃可行的法律科技應用方案。

律政司也意識到讓法律學生瞭解法律科技的重要性，會透過法律教育及培訓常設委員會的平台，與法律教育及培訓工作的持份者研究在法律教育課程內加強有關法律科技的培訓。律政司亦計劃起草及發布路線圖，以協助法律業界開展法律科技應用之路；律政司亦計劃發布道德及安全指引，讓法律業界在使用法律科技時遵循。

（2）第二階段：推動業界認識法律科技產品

律政司有意籌劃舉辦法律科技產品博覽，讓法律業界接觸和體驗市場上不同的法律科技產品，找出適合其業務發展的法律科技解決方案。

此外，我們亦正考慮進行市場調查，為法律業界統整在市場上提供的法律科技產品清單，為法律業界提供較為全面的資訊作參考。

（3）第三階段：推動業界使用法律科技

律政司會鼓勵本地及海內外法律科技企業在本地巿場發展，建立香港的法律科技生態系統。律政司將審視上述策略的成效，並在適當時間以政策措施推動業界使用法律科技，並會不時檢討現行法律制度，以更好地支持和規管創新和新興法律科技的發展。

透過上述策略，我們希望能有效提升法律業界對法律科技的認識和應用，從而提升工作效率和專業服務質素，鞏固香港作為亞太區國際法律服務及爭議解決中心的地位。

多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Application of legal technology and artificial intelligence,2025-07-09 15:25,2025-07-09 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900443.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Maggie Chan and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 It is learnt that the Department of Justice has been actively promoting the application of legal technology (lawtech) and artificial intelligence (AI) in the legal sector. There are views that the Government should actively develop AI tools (e.g. large language model developed by the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center) for application in areas of the common law, so as to enhance the operational efficiency and competitiveness of the legal sector. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has currently developed large language models for application in areas of the common law; if so, of the specific details and the implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has plans to organise lawtech and AI summits or international exhibitions with the Mainland on a regular basis, so as to promote exchanges and co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong in lawtech; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; whether it has plans to introduce lawtech from the Mainland and apply it in areas of Hong Kong common law, as well as promote the Mainland's AI legal service products to Hong Kong and overseas; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the measures in place to ensure that small and medium-sized law firms in Hong Kong can benefit from the development of lawtech and AI, such as providing technical support, introducing a tax allowance for ""lawtech equipment"" and subsidising their procurement of lawtech-related equipment?

Reply:

President,

(1) The Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Center (HKGAI), an inter-school co-operative research centre led by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, has developed the first local large language model (LLM) based on DeepSeek technology with full parameter fine-tuning – ""HKGAI V1"". The HKGAI has developed multiple vertical applications for various public service sectors based on this local LLM, including the generative artificial intelligence (AI) document assistance application ""HKPilot"" and the legal-related ""LexiHK"". The Department of Justice (DoJ) is currently participating in the pilot use of ""HKPilot"" and is considering participating in the trial of ""LexiHK"" after reviewing its effectiveness. At the same time, the Faculty of Law of the Chinese University of Hong Kong has recently collaborated with an AI software company to develop a legal information AI model based on the Cantonese LLM to facilitate the digital transformation of the legal system and industry. WiseLaw Digital Technology, a company incubated by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, has also recently announced its innovation achievement in legal AI products. The DoJ will collaborate with the HKGAI and other relevant government departments or institutions based on the trial results, market technology development, the needs of the legal sector and the community, and related resource considerations to examine and promote the further application of AI in the legal sector, especially LLMs related to Hong Kong law.

(2) The DoJ attaches great importance on the development of areas of lawtech and AI, and believes that forums and exhibitions provides an important platform for fostering exchange and co-operation. Currently, the DoJ is actively preparing related activities, aiming to hold the first large-scale activity open to global participants, creating a diverse and open exchange platform to promote the sharing of wisdom and experience from various regions.

 We note that there are currently a number of well-developed lawtech enterprises in Mainland China. Since Mainland lawtech is now primarily designed for the Mainland legal system, it may not be directly applicable to Hong Kong's common law market. However, we strongly encourage Mainland lawtech enterprises to set up in Hong Kong to explore the local legal market, develop AI products suitable for the Hong Kong common law market, and use Hong Kong as a springboard to develop markets in other common law jurisdictions overseas.

(3) To promote the development of lawtech, the DoJ established the Consultation Group on Lawtech Development (Consultation Group) in January 2025, and invited the industry and various stakeholders to jointly study and formulate policy measures related to lawtech. The Consultation Group members include representatives from the legal and dispute resolution sectors, law schools, and the lawtech industry, including representatives from small and medium-sized law firms, ensuring that the policies will suit the needs of practitioners.

 The Consultation Group notes in particular the challenges faced by small and medium-sized law firms in promoting the use of lawtech. In addition to economic factors, we understand that small and medium-sized law firms often have limited understanding of lawtech, and traditional practice models tend to rely less on technology, which affects their willingness to adopt new technologies.

 In response to this situation, the DoJ has accepted the suggestion of the Consultation Group and plans to promote the use of technology in the legal industry progressively in three stages:

(1) Phase 1: Lawtech awareness and education

 The aim of the first stage of the policy on promoting lawtech is to change certain ingrained mindsets and practices within the legal profession by raising their awareness of lawtech, and helping them to understand the benefits of the use of lawtech that can bring to the profession and the risk management awareness that the profession should have. To this end, the DoJ is organising a series of lawtech-related roundtables and events to raise the profession's understanding of lawtech and to facilitate the exchange and sharing of information between the profession and lawtech experts to enable them to plan for viable adoption of lawtech.

 The DoJ is also aware of the importance of educating law students about lawtech, and will work with stakeholders in legal education and training to strengthen training related to lawtech in legal education curricula through the Standing Committee on Legal Education and Training platform. The DoJ plans to draft and publish a roadmap to assist the legal profession in embarking on their path to technology applications. The DoJ also plans to issue ethical and security guidelines for the legal profession to follow when using lawtech.

(2) Phase 2: Promoting the profession's engagement with lawtech products

 The DoJ intends to organise an exhibition of lawtech products to enable the legal profession to access and experience a variety of lawtech products available in the market and to identify lawtech solutions suitable for their business development.

 In addition, we are considering conducting a market survey to consolidate a list of lawtech products available in the market in order to provide more comprehensive information to the legal sector for reference.

(3) Phase 3: Promoting the use of lawtech in the legal profession

 The DoJ will encourage local and overseas lawtech enterprises to establish and grow in the local market, thereby fostering Hong Kong's lawtech ecosystem. The DoJ will review the effectiveness of the above strategies and take policy measures to promote the use of lawtech in the legal profession as appropriate. The DoJ will also review the existing legal framework from time to time in order to better support and regulate the development of innovative and emerging legal technologies.

 Through these strategies, we hope to effectively enhance the awareness and use of lawtech by the legal profession, thereby enhancing the efficiency and quality of professional services and strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international legal services and dispute resolution centre in the Asia-Pacific region.

 Thank you, President."

主席：

我動議二讀《2025年立法會（權力及特權）（修訂）條例草案》。

因應立法會完善立法會議員履職制度和引入《立法會議員守則》（《守則》），立法會建議修訂《立法會（權力及特權）條例》（《條例》），對因違反《守則》而根據《議事規則》被暫停職務的立法會議員施加財政處分。

立法會議事規則委員會和內務委員會已通過支持制定《守則》，進一步完善立法會議員的履職制度，包括清楚訂明對立法會議員行為操守和履職的要求、改善立法會議員利益申報機制，以及就立法會議員各類不當行為設立處分機制。當中，立法會建議向違反《守則》並查明屬實的議員施加不同程度的處分，包括涉事議員可以被暫停立法會職務，並且在停職期間不會獲發議員酬金及津貼。

根據現行《條例》，只有在議員作出極不檢點行為而被暫停職務的情況下，其停職期間的酬金及津貼才會被扣起。為落實立法會的建議，特區政府應立法會要求提交本《條例草案》，擴大財政處分的適用範圍，涵蓋議員因其他違反《守則》行為而被暫停職務的情況。修訂同時賦予立法會彈性，容許日後根據《議事規則》批准的其他理由，扣起被暫停職務議員的酬金及津貼。

政府樂見立法會以更高的標準加強自我監督和自我完善，並提升運作透明度。立法會引入《守則》，符合社會對立法會議員的期望。

如果議員支持及早日通過《條例草案》，有關的修訂建議就能在第八屆立法會任期開始當日生效，配合立法會完善議員的履職制度，為下一屆立法會能繼續貫徹「愛國者治港」原則、更好發揮立法會的憲制職能奠定良好的基礎。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

Government revises traffic-related fees and fixed penalties,2025-07-09 15:15,2025-07-09 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900404.htm,"The Government announced today (July 9) a proposal to adjust four traffic-related fees, including tunnel tolls, licence fees for electric private cars, the maximum fee level of parking meters, and fixed penalties for traffic offences.

The spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The 2025-26 Budget announced that the Government would focus on reviewing traffic charges and fixed penalties that have not been adjusted for many years. Our overall considerations are to enhance traffic management and maintain public fiscal discipline, reflecting the principles of 'cost recovery' and 'user pays'.""

To this end, the Government has formulated a total of four legislative amendments:

(1) Road Tunnels (Government) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulation 2025 - Adjustment of tunnel tolls

Adopting a science-based approach, the Government has reviewed the tolls for government tunnels and major roads, in the order of priority, adhering to four charging principles: traffic management needs, efficiency first, public transport first, and ""user-pays"". After comprehensively considering these four principles and the specific circumstances of each tunnel and major road, it has been decided to propose increasing the tolls for the Aberdeen Tunnel and Shing Mun Tunnels, and to introduce a toll for the use of the Central Kowloon Bypass. The new tolls for the Aberdeen Tunnel and Shing Mun Tunnels will be effective on September 21, 2025, while toll collection for the Central Kowloon Bypass will commence when it is fully commissioned in 2026. The toll scheme is summarised as follows:





Current toll
			(Fixed toll for all vehicles throughout the day)
Proposed toll
			(Fixed toll for all vehicles throughout the day)


Aberdeen Tunnel
$5
$8


Shing Mun Tunnels
$5
$8


Central Kowloon Bypass
			(Yau Ma Tei Section Tunnel)
/
$8




The spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The tolls for the Aberdeen Tunnel and Shing Mun Tunnels have not been adjusted for 34 years, during which time inflation has exceeded 130 per cent, resulting in operational deficits. The $8 toll is expected to have a minimal impact on traffic, and the adjusted tolls will enable the tunnels to achieve break-even in operations. On the other hand, the Central Kowloon Bypass will alleviate the current traffic congestion on major trunk roads in Kowloon, offering a shorter route with higher speeds, making it highly attractive to drivers. If no toll is charged for the use of the Central Kowloon Bypass, it is expected that its utilisation rate will approach a saturation point shortly after its commissioning. Taking into account the views of the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Transport (TP) and the community, and in order to attract more motorists to use the bypass and hence achieve an effective traffic diversion, the Government is proposing an $8 toll. The proposed toll level will effectively divert approximately 20 per cent of the overall traffic from saturated major roads in Kowloon, while reserving about 15 per cent of spare capacity of theCentral Kowloon Bypass to accommodate future traffic growth. It will also recover nearly 80 per cent of basic operational costs; and according to the efficiency-first principle, the fees payable by commercial and public transport vehicles will be consistent with the moderate toll charged for smaller private cars.""

The spokesperson continued, ""We have also reviewed other government tunnels and trunk roads in accordance with the four major principles. In summary, taking into account the traffic management needs and traffic flow of other government tunnels and trunk roads, the traffic flow of alternative routes, as well as future transport infrastructure projects related to each route, such as the commissioning of new alternative routes, we recommend maintaining the current tolling arrangements for the time being and reviewing them again at an appropriate time.""

(2) Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulation 2025 - Rationalising the licence fee structure and levels for electric private cars

The existing licence fees for electric private cars are charged by vehicle unladen weight, and the licence fees for fuel-propelled private cars are about six times more than that for electric private cars. The Government proposes to revise the annual licence fee structure for electric private cars by charging licence fees based on their rated power. A five-tier licence fee structure for electric private cars based on their rated power will be introduced, and the fee levels will be suitably adjusted, which would take five phases over six years to complete, to align with technological advancements and practices in other regions. The new licence fee structure will take effect from November 1, 2025, and will apply to newly registered electric private cars, while existing electric private cars will be granted a four-month grace period. Details are as follows:

# Exclusive of the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Fund levy (at $114 per vehicle annually).
			* The fee for a licence for four months is 35 per cent of that for an annual licence, plus an additional fee of $30.




Licence fee concessions will be offered to eligible disabled electric private car owners (see note).

The spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""Taking into account the views of the LegCo TP, the adjustment of electric private cars licence fees will be implemented in five phases to provide the public with a longer adaptation period. Upon adjustments, the new annual licence fee levels for electric private cars will still be 25 per cent (fifth tier) to 40 per cent (first tier) lower than the current licence fees for fuel-propelled vehicles, to continue encouraging motorists to switch to electric vehicles and promote environmental protection. According to the current type distribution of licensed electric private cars, 99 per cent of the vehicles fall within the first, second and third tiers, while the proportions of vehicles in the fourth and fifth tiers are only 1 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. As electric vehicles become increasingly popular, with a wider range of brands and models available on the market, and given that electric vehicles have lower energy, repair and maintenance costs compared to fuel-propelled vehicles, we expect that electric vehicles will remain appealing to motorists even after the rationalisation of annual licence fee structure and levels.""

(3) Road Traffic (Parking) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 - Adjustment of parking meter charges

To optimise the use of limited parking resources, the Government proposes to increase the maximum fee for metered parking from $2 per 15 minutes to $4 per 15 minutes, viz. a maximum fee of $16 per hour to increase the turnover of vehicles using metered parking spaces to meet the short-term parking needs of motorists. The new charges for metered parking spaces will take effect from September 28, 2025. The fees for metered parking spaces for goods vehicles, buses and coaches will be maintained at the existing level.

(4) Proposed Motion for Resolutions under the Fixed Penalty (Traffic Contraventions) Ordinance (Cap. 237) and the Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance (Cap. 240) - Adjustment of fixed penalties for traffic offences

To enhance traffic safety and ensure a smooth traffic flow, the Government proposes to increase the fixed penalty for illegal parking from the current $320 to $400 (a 25 per cent increase). The fixed penalties for 19 other traffic offences related to road safety and traffic congestion (details in the Annex) will be increased from the current range of $320 to $1,000 to a new range of $480 to $1,500 (a 50 per cent increase). The penalty amounts for other traffic offences will remain unchanged.

The spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The fixed penalty levels for illegal parking and most of the traffic contraventions have remained unchanged for 31 years, and their deterrent effect may have been offset by inflation during this period. In fact, the fixed penalty levels of traffic contraventions in Hong Kong are much lower than those of various overseas regions. We have observed that the numbers of certain traffic offences continue to trend upwards or remain at a persistently high level. Adjusting the penalty amounts for these traffic offences will help enhance the deterrent effect, thereby safeguarding traffic safety and maintaining smooth traffic flow. At the same time, the Government will strive to increase the supply of parking spaces to meet parking demand as far as possible.""

The Road Tunnels (Government) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulation 2025, the Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulation 2025, and the Road Traffic (Parking) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 will be gazetted on July 18 and tabled at the LegCo on July 23 for negative vetting. As for the penalties for traffic violations under the Schedules to the Fixed Penalty (Traffic Contraventions) Ordinance (Cap. 237) and the Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance (Cap. 240), the LegCo may amend them by resolution under positive vetting. The Secretary for Transport and Logistics will move a motion at the LegCo meeting on July 30 to pass the resolutions. The regulatory details and effective dates are specified in respective amendment regulations and the proposed resolutions, and relevant information is set out in the LegCo brief issued by the Government today.

Note:No licence fee shall be payable where the rated power of an electric private car owned by an eligible disabled person does not exceed 75 kilowatts. Where the rated power of the electric private car exceeds 75 kilowatts, the annual licence fee payable shall be calculated by the deduction from the prescribed annual licence fee payable in respect of its rated power which does not exceed 75 kilowatts."

立法會一題：人口肥胖問題,2025-07-09 14:45,2025-07-09 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900415.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳健波議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

政府於二○一八年推出《邁向2025：香港非傳染病防控策略及行動計劃》，列出須在二○二五年或之前實現的防控非傳染病目標，當中包括「制止糖尿病及肥胖問題上升」。然而根據衞生署的《2020至2022年度人口健康調查報告書》，本港15歲至84歲人士中有百分之二十二屬超重，百分之三十二點六屬肥胖，較二○一四至二○一五年度數據有所增加，顯示肥胖問題有上升趨勢。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）政府最新掌握的肥胖人口相關數據，以及其與二○一八年所訂目標的差距為何；衞生署就本港肥胖人口進行調查的頻率及下次調查時間為何；

（二）政府就制止肥胖問題上升採取了甚麼措施；有否檢視該等措施的成效，以及其未能有效制止肥胖問題上升的原因；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）國家衞生健康委員會去年推動「體重管理年」三年行動，目標把肥胖率年均增幅下降一成，政府有何措施配合有關政策？

答覆：

主席：

肥胖是一個全球性的問題。根據世界衞生組織（世衞）的數據，由一九九○年到二○二二年，全球肥胖流行率增加一倍多，並在新冠疫情期間惡化。香港特別行政區政府一直密切關注肥胖問題，並於二○一八年發表《邁向2025︰香港非傳染病防控策略及行動計劃》（《策略及行動計劃》），重點關注包括肥胖問題等非傳染病和其共通行為風險因素（例如不健康飲食、缺乏體能活動），從而全方位推廣健康生活模式。

就陳健波議員的提問，經諮詢相關政策局及部門後，我現在回覆如下：

（一）《策略及行動計劃》參考了世衞《2013至2020年防控非傳染病全球行動計劃》，其中一個目標是制止18至84歲人士糖尿病及肥胖問題的上升，即與二○一四／二○一五年度比較，二○二五年或之前相關比率無增長。

衞生署大約每五年進行一次人口健康調查，其間亦會進行健康行為調查作恆常監測。陳健波議員所引用數據是最近一次人口健康調查，即二○二○至二二年度進行。當時18至84歲人士的超重及肥胖普遍率為51.3%，高於二○一四／一五年度的47%（註），但當時正值新冠疫情期間，市民的生活模式經歷重大轉變，包括缺少體能活動和有一些不良的飲食習慣。2025/26年度人口健康調查預計將於今年第三季正式開始，並於二○二六年年尾有結果。政府會以有關數據，檢視《策略及行動計劃》的目標及成效。

事實上，我們留意到相關情況在新冠疫後有顯著改善的跡象，例如：

（ｉ）2020-22年度人口健康調查結果顯示24.8%的18歲或以上人士體能活動量不足，當時是新冠疫情期間，而有關數字於二○二三年度健康行為調查已經有所改善，數字為14.8%。

（ｉｉ）衞生署學生健康服務的數據亦顯示，中小學生肥胖及超重的問題在疫後有明顯改善。普遍率由二○二一／二二學年的21.2%下降至二○二三／二四學年17.9%，是自二○一○／一一學年以來的最低。相關數據載於附件。

（二）肥胖問題源於由食物及飲料中攝取的熱量超過正常身體機能和日常活動消耗的熱量。奉行健康生活模式，控制飲食及增加運動是降低肥胖風險的關鍵。衞生署一直以貫穿人生歷程和環境為本的方式，推行全民的介入措施和計劃，例如：

（ｉ）「全校園健康計劃」下編製「一校一健康報告」以針對性校本措施，改善中小學生體能活動和飲食。現時有超過800間學校參與，涵蓋近七成全港中小學。

（ｉｉ）「好心情@健康工作間」計劃向僱主和僱員推廣健康飲食、體能活動及心理健康。現時有超過3 400間機構參與，涵蓋超過82萬名僱員。

（ｉｉｉ）「星級有營食肆」運動，鼓勵食肆提供少鹽、少糖、少油及多蔬果的菜式，並協助市民實踐健康飲食。現時有超過1 300家食肆參與。

（ｉｖ）「日行萬步」活動令更多市民認識步行對身心健康的益處。去年我們與深圳市和珠海市一起舉辦的活動，有約一萬名市民參加。

基層醫療方面，地區康健中心積極推廣「健康人生計劃」，為不同年齡層的市民建立健康生活模式及自我健康管理的意識，而新設立的「樂研站」亦為婦女提供體重管理健康教育。

其他政策局及部門亦致力營造有利環境，推動市民建立健康生活，相關工作包括：

（ｉ）教育局先後開展「躍動校園活力人生」計劃及「MVPA60獎勵計劃」，鼓勵學生盡早建立恆常參與體能活動的習慣。

（ｉｉ）環境及生態局推動減糖，其轄下的降低食物中鹽和糖委員會與不同部門和飲食業界協作，包括推行預先包裝食品標籤計劃（預先包裝食品「鹽╱糖」標籤計劃）以協助消費者辨認「低糖」產品。

（ｉｉｉ）康樂及文化事務署舉辦多元化的康體活動，以在社區和校園推廣「普及體育」的文化，更加自二○○九年起，每年舉辦全民運動日。

（三）在「一國兩制」框架下，醫務衞生局與國家衞生健康委員會（國家衞健委）保持緊密聯繫，上述的《策略及行動計劃》亦配合國家的健康政策。政府會繼續參考世衞的《防控非傳染病全球行動計劃》，以及國家衞健委制訂的多角度體重管理方針，提升公眾有關健康生活重要性的意識，積極與持份者和社區夥伴密切合作，以營造更有利健康的環境。

多謝主席。

註：體重指標的定義為體重（公斤）除以身高（米）的平方。其單位為公斤／平方米（kg/m2）。根據本港成年人超重和肥胖定義，體重指標介乎23至25以下屬超重，而體重指標達25或以上則屬肥胖。有關普遍率為年齡標準化普遍率。"
LCQ1: Obesity in the population,2025-07-09 14:45,2025-07-09 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900418.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Kin-por and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

  In 2018, the Government launched the ""Towards 2025: Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent and Control Non-communicable Diseases in Hong Kong"", setting out the targets for preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases to be achieved by 2025, which include ""halting the rise in diabetes and obesity"". However, according to the Department of Health's ""Report of Population Health Survey 2020-2022"", 22 per cent of the people in Hong Kong aged 15 to 84 are overweight and 32.6 per centare obese, which is an increase as compared with the 2014-2015 data, indicating that obesity is on the rise. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest data relating to the obese population available to the Government, and the gap between such data and the target set in 2018; the frequency of surveys on the obese population in Hong Kong conducted by the Department of Health and the timing of the next survey;

(2) of the measures taken by the Government to halt the rise in obesity; whether it has reviewed the effectiveness of such measures and the reasons for their failure to effectively halt the rise in obesity; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) the National Health Commission launched a three-year ""Weight Management Year"" initiative last year, aiming to reduce the average annual increase in obesity rate by 10 per cent, of the measures put in place by the Government to tie in with the relevant policy?

Reply:

President,

  Obesity is a global problem. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the global prevalence of obesity has increased by more than doubled from 1990 to 2022, and the situation worsened during the COVID-19 epidemic. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has all along been closely monitoring the obesity problem and launched the ""Towards 2025: Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent and Control Non-communicable Diseases in Hong Kong"" (SAP) in 2018 with a focus on non-communicable diseases (including obesity) and their common behavioural risk factors (such as unhealthy diet and physical inactivity), to comprehensively promote a healthy lifestyle.

  In consultation with relevant bureaux and departments, my reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Kin-por is as follows:

(1) The SAP has made reference to the WHO's ""Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases 2013-2020"", and one of the objectives is to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity among individuals aged 18 to 84, viz. ensuring that by 2025 or earlier, the prevalence rates do not increase compared to 2014-15.

  The Department of Health (DH) conducts Population Health Survey (PHS) approximately every five years with Health Behaviour Survey (HBS) conducted in between as regular surveillance. The figures quoted by the Hon Chan Kin-por are from the latest PHS (i.e. conducted in 2020-22). The prevalence of overweight and obesity among people aged between 18 and 84 at that time was 51.3 per cent, which was higher than 47 per cent in 2014/15 (Note). However, that was during COVID-19 epidemic where there were significant changes in the living habits of our citizens, including lack of physical activities and having some unhealthy eating habits. The 2025/26 PHS is expected to be commenced in the third quarter this year with the findings expected to be available in end-2026. The Government will review the objectives and effectiveness of the SAP by referencing the relevant data.

  In fact, we have noticed significant improvements in related situations post-COVID-19 epidemic, for example:

(i) The PHS 2020-22 showed that 24.8 per cent of individuals aged 18 or above performed an insufficient level of physical activity and that was during the COVID-19 epidemic, The relevant figure has already improved in the HBS 2023 to 14.8 per cent.

(ii) Data from the Student Health Service of the DH also showed that the problem of obesity and overweight among primary and secondary students showed significant improvement after the epidemic, with prevalence decreased from 21.2 per cent in the 2021/22school year to 17.9 per cent in the 2023/24 school year, which was the lowest since the 2010/11 school year. Relevant statistics are at Annex.

(2) The fundamental cause of obesity is the amount of calories consumed from food and drinks exceeds the amount of calories expended in normal body functions and daily activities. Leading a healthy lifestyle, including managing diet and increase physical activities, is the key to reducing the risk of obesity. The DH has adopted a life-course and settings-based approach and implemented population-wide intervention measures and programmes, for example:

(i) Under the Whole School Health Programme, health reports are compiled for each participating school to recommend targeted school-based measures to improve physical activities and meals of primary and secondary students. Currently, over 800 schools have participated in the Programme, covering nearly 70 per cent of primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong.

(ii) The ""Joyful@Healthy Workplace"" programme promotes healthy eating, physical activities and mental health to employers and employees. Currently, over 3 400 organisations have participated in the programme, covering more than 820 000 employees.

(iii) The ""EatSmart Restaurant Star+"" campaign encourages restaurants to offer less salt, sugar and oil with more vegetables and fruit dishes to assist citizens in practicing healthy eating. Currently, over 1 300 restaurants have participated in the campaign.

(iv) The ""10 000 Steps a Day"" Campaign raises public awareness of the physical and mental health benefits of walking. Last year, about 10 000 citizens participated in the event we organised together with Shenzhen and Zhuhai.

  As regards primary healthcare, the District Health Centres actively promote the Life Course Preventive Care Plan to establish healthy lifestyle patterns and raise self-health management awareness among citizens of different age groups. The newly established Women Wellness Satellites will also provide weight management health educational activities for women.

  Other bureaux and departments are also committed to creating a favourable environment to encourage citizens to establish healthy lifestyles. Related efforts include:

(i) The Education Bureau launched the ""Active Students, Active People"" Campaign and the ""MVPA60 Award Scheme"" to encourage students to develop the habit of regular physical activity at an early stage.

(ii) The Environment and Ecology Bureau promotes sugar reduction. Its Committee on Reduction of Salt and Sugar in Food collaborates with various departments and the food and beverage industry, including the implementation of the ""Salt/Sugar"" Label Scheme for Prepackaged Food Products to help consumers identify ""low-sugar"" products.

(iii) The Leisure and Cultural Services Department offers diversified recreation and sports programmes to promote ""Sport for All"" culture in the community and at schools. It has been organising the Sport For All Day annually since 2009.

(3) Under the Framework of ""one country, two systems"", the Health Bureau maintains close contact with the National Health Commission (NHC). The aforementioned SAP is also aligned with the national health policy. The Government will continue to enhance public awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle with reference to the WHO's Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases and the multi-faceted weight management guidelines formulated by the NHC, actively collaborate with stakeholders and community partners to create a more health-conducive environment.

  Thank you, President.

Note: Body mass index (BMI) is defined as weight (kilogram) divided by the square of height (metre). Its unit of measurement is kilogram/metre2 (kg/m2). Based on the definition of overweight and obesity for adults adopted in Hong Kong, a BMI from 23 to less than 25 is regarded as overweight, while a BMI of 25 or more is considered obese. Relevant prevalence is age-standardised prevalence."
立法會六題：公共交通工具的非禮案,2025-07-09 14:36,2025-07-09 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900395.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上林新強議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的答覆：

問題：

近年公共交通工具不時發生非禮案，引起公眾關注。另一方面，有意見指出在車廂擁擠的情況下，人與人之間的肢體接觸難以避免，或可能被誤會為非禮行為。此外，社會對公共交通工具的安全度、舒適度，以及乘客間互相尊重的期望也不斷提高。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，警方每年接獲多少宗在公共交通工具上發生的非禮案件，以及該數目佔在公共交通工具上發生的案件總數的百分比為何；該等非禮案件中，有多少宗成功定罪；是否知悉法庭審理該等非禮案件平均需時多久；及

（二）會否考慮在各大型公共交通工具（例如港鐵及專營巴士）設立女士或男士專用的區域或車廂；如會，實施時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

​警方非常重視並會全力調查每宗涉及性罪行的案件，特別是發生在公共交通工具上的相關罪行。目前發生在公共交通工具上的性罪行主要為非禮案件，即《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）的猥褻侵犯罪，一經循公訴程序定罪，可處監禁10年。此外，也有發生窺淫及俗稱「影裙底」的非法拍攝或觀察私密部位案件，兩者在《刑事罪行條例》的最高刑罰均為監禁五年。

警方會繼續加強在相關地區的軍裝及便衣巡邏，並與公共運輸機構緊密合作，協力打撃在公共交通工具發生的非禮及相關罪行。警方亦會加強宣傳教育工作，提高市民的警覺性，以及鼓勵市民遇有罪案發生，應挺身舉報。

就議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局後，我現回覆如下：

（一）過去五年，警方接獲有關交通工具／轉乘處／車站發生的性罪行，包括《刑事罪行條例》的猥褻侵犯罪、窺淫及非法拍攝或觀察私密部位罪報案宗數，佔所有在公共交通工具上的案件約7%至21%不等。詳情可參閱附件。就二○二五年首五個月而言，警方共接獲141宗相關報案，佔所有在公共交通工具／轉乘處／車站發生的案件總數約14%。

政府未有就上述性罪行的定罪數字以案發地點作分項統計，亦沒有備存法院審理這類案件所需時間的相關統計數字。

（二）至於會否在各大型公共交通工具（例如港鐵及專營巴士）設立女士或男士專用的區域或車廂，涉及多項考慮因素。本港的公共交通系統每天載客量超過1 100萬人次，其中港鐵和專營巴士是最主要的出行途徑，每日的乘客人次分別超過500萬人次和370萬人次。

港鐵是世界上其中一個服務最頻密的鐵路系統。在二○二四年，重鐵列車及輕鐵共行駛逾271萬班次，繁忙時間列車服務可達約每兩分鐘一班。

港鐵公司有參考一些海外經驗，但經評估後認為不適宜在港鐵網絡設立女士或男士專用車廂。現時繁忙時間，港鐵系統月台（尤其在轉線車站）普遍出現人潮，港鐵公司須善用月台和車廂空間以疏導人流。設置專用車廂會對車站及月台的客流管理，以及列車車廂之間的客流造成影響。此外，港鐵大部分列車車廂屬開放式設計，在運作上難以控制乘客遵循有關安排。因此港鐵公司現階段沒有計劃設置專用車廂。

為防止鐵路非禮罪行，港鐵公司已在車站張貼海報，加強宣傳防止非禮罪行信息，並鼓勵乘客不要啞忍，當遇事或發現有非禮罪案發生時，要挺身而出盡快報警，或通知車站職員。港鐵車站職員已接受適當訓練，以協助警方打擊罪行。此外，港鐵公司與警方亦有定期召開防止罪案會議，交換最新罪案趨勢及情報，商討針對性策略打擊罪案，並會與警方合作舉辦宣傳活動，包括每年定期舉辦的反罪惡宣傳活動，以提高乘客的防罪意識。

至於專營巴士方面，不少路線於繁忙時段均有較高的載客率。由於車廂空間有限，而且乘客須使用車廂內同一通道上落車，在車廂內設置專用區域會影響巴士的載客效率，而且在運作上亦難以控制乘客遵循有關安排。專營巴士公司亦會和警方合作，加強打擊相關罪行。"
LCQ6: Indecent assault cases on public transport,2025-07-09 14:36,2025-07-09 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900394.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lam San-keung and a reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

In recent years, there have been sporadic cases of indecent assault on public transport which arouse public concern. On the other hand, there are views that physical contact between individuals is difficult to be avoided in crowded vehicle compartments and could be mistaken for indecent assault. Moreover, society's expectations for safety, comfort and mutual respect among passengers on public transport are increasing. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of indecent assault cases occurred on public transport that the Police received in each of the past five years, and the percentage of these cases out of the total number of cases occurring on public transport; the number of convictions among these indecent assault cases; whether it knows the average time taken by the courts to adjudicate these indecent assault cases; and

(2) whether it will consider introducing women-only or men-only zones or compartments on public transport mass-carriers (e.g. the MTR and franchised buses); if so, of the implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Police attach great importance to all cases involving sexual offences and are dedicated to investigating each of them thoroughly, with particular focus on offences taking place on public transport. At present, sexual offences occurred on public transport are mainly indecent assault cases (i.e. offence of indecent assault under the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200)), for which offenders shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for 10 years. There are also cases of voyeurism and unlawful recording or observation of intimate parts (commonly known as ""upskirt photography""), both of which carry a maximum penalty of five years of imprisonment under the Crimes Ordinance.

The Police will continue to strengthen patrols by uniformed and plain-clothes officers in relevant areas, and will work closely with public transport operators to jointly combat indecent assault and its related offences on public transport. In parallel, the Police will step up publicity and education efforts to enhance public awareness and encourage members of the public to report crimes.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) In the past five years, the number of reports received by the Police on sexual offences occurred on public transport/interchanges/transport stations, including offences of indecent assault, voyeurism and unlawful recording or observation of intimate parts under the Crimes Ordinance, accounted for about seven per cent to 21 per cent of all offences occurred on public transport. Please refer to the Annex for details. For the first five months of 2025, the Police received a total of 141 relevant reports, which accounted for about 14 per cent of the total number of offences occurred on public transport/interchanges/transport stations.

The Government maintains neither a breakdown on the number of convictions of the above sexual offences by place of occurrence nor relevant statistics on the time taken by courts to adjudicate such cases.

(2) As to whether women-only or men-only zones or compartments shall be introduced on various mass public transport modes (such as MTR and franchised buses), a number of considerations are relevant. The public transport system in Hong Kong carries a total patronage of more than 11 million passenger trips daily, with the MTR and franchised buses being the main travelling means handling over 5 million and 3.7 million passenger trips per day respectively.

The MTR is one of the railway systems with the most frequent services in the world. In 2024, the heavy rail and light rail operated over 2.71 million trips, with train services reaching about one train in every two minutes during peak hours.

The MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) has made reference to some overseas experience but assessed that it would not be appropriate to introduce women-only or men-only compartments in the MTR network. At present, during peak hours, the MTR system is generally crowded at platforms (especially at interchange stations), and the MTRCL has to make good use of the space on platform as well as inside train compartment to ease the passenger flow. Introducing dedicated train compartments would affect the management of passenger flow at stations and platforms, as well as the flow of passengers between train compartments. In addition, most of the MTR train compartments are of open design and it is operationally difficult to control passengers to follow the arrangement. Therefore, the MTRCL has no plan at this stage to introduce dedicated train compartments.

To prevent crimes of indecent assaults in the railway premises, the MTRCL has put up posters at stations to step up the promotion of anti-crime messages on indecent assaults. Passengers are encouraged not to remain silent, and report incidents or crimes of indecent assaults immediately to the Police or station staff. The MTR station staff are properly trained to assist the Police in combating crimes. In addition, the MTRCL and the Police hold regular anti-crime meetings to share information about the latest crime trend and intelligence, and to deliberate on specific strategies to combat crimes. The MTRCL also organises publicity activities in collaboration with the Police (including regular anti-crime publicity activities organised annually) so as to raise passengers' anti-crime awareness.

In respect of franchised buses, many routes have high occupancy rates during peak hours. As there is limited space in the compartments and passengers board and alight in the same aisle, setting up dedicated areas inside the compartments will affect the passenger-carrying efficiency of buses. In addition, it will be operationally difficult to ensure that passengers follow the arrangements. Franchised bus companies will co-operate with the police to enhance efforts in combating crimes."
立法會十七題：打擊網上投資詐騙,2025-07-09 14:30,2025-07-09 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900265.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上梁美芬議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

根據政府於今年六月回覆本會議員質詢時所提供的數據，今年首四個月警方共錄得1 534宗網上投資騙案，涉及騙款金額約10.2億元。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）已針對三種常見的投資騙局展開防騙宣傳教育，政府有否制訂具體措施支持證監會的反詐騙宣傳活動，以提高公眾對投資騙局的警覺性；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）有否計劃加強與證監會的合作，更新和強化投資者教育，以確保投資者能夠有效識別及防範新興的投資風險和不斷演變的詐騙手法和科技；及

（三）針對證監會推出的「咪做水魚」反詐騙宣傳活動，政府有否進一步的策略或投放更多資源，以擴大該活動的影響力，使更多投資者能夠受益並避免成為網上投資騙案的受害者，如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府十分重視投資者教育，一直致力支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及轄下的投資者及理財教育委員會（投委會），透過不同形式和渠道加強公眾的理財能力。就問題的各部分，經諮詢保安局、證監會及香港金融管理局（金管局），我現回覆如下。

（一）及（二）二○二五年首五個月，警方合共錄得1 849宗網上投資騙案，涉及金額約為12.4億元。政府十分重視投資者的保障，持續致力透過宣傳及執法兩大方向打擊網上投資騙案。

宣傳方面，政府聯同證監會及其轄下的投委會，一直致力提升投資者的金融防騙能力，提高大眾對相關金融產品的認知，並提醒投資者注意數碼理財的風險。

投委會於二○二五年三月聯同不同持份者舉辦的「香港理財月」以「反呃防騙理財抗逆」為主題，透過跨媒體宣傳向不同社群分享防騙資訊，全方位推廣防騙訊息。宣傳短片於宣傳期內共錄得2 060萬瀏覽次數。針對日新月異的科技及不斷演變的詐騙手法，投委會亦透過不同的金融防騙教育資訊、動畫短片、網上講座等資源，教育公眾防範投資騙案，包括「唱高散貨」、社交媒體投資群組、欺詐交易應用程式或投資平台、偽冒身分、深度偽造（Deepfake）技術及釣魚短訊等。投委會的網站也設有網上防騙遊戲及反詐騙測試，讓公眾在有趣互動的遊戲中學習防騙知識。

投委會於二○二四年三月推出全港首個數碼體驗模式的「理財教育體驗館」，以沉浸式和互動方式為更多市民提供投資及防騙教育。館內設有多個以防騙為主題的互動遊戲，讓訪客學習辨識和應對各種金融陷阱。截至二○二五年六月底，已有超過26 500人次到訪體驗館，絕大部分訪客表示體驗館提升了他們的防騙知識。

另一方面，金管局聯同銀行推出了名為「智安存」的保護措施，為客戶的銀行存款提供多一重的保護。「智安存」讓客戶可將部分銀行存款分隔，不能經由網上及其他渠道轉出，並在動用受保護的存款時，需要到銀行分行由職員進行額外核實程序。所有零售銀行將於今年年底前全面推出「智安存」服務。

針對網上投資騙案的執法方面，由於現時本港大部分騙案利用傀儡戶口收款，打擊傀儡戶口是打擊詐騙產業鏈的有效方法。二○二五年首五個月，警方就涉及各類型騙案及洗黑錢的罪行共拘捕3 028人，當中約七成被捕人士是傀儡戶口持有人。警方亦自二○二三年年底起，就涉及傀儡戶口的案件向法庭申請引用《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）第27條加重刑罰，以加強阻嚇力。有被定罪的傀儡戶口持有人刑期加幅超過三成。

香港警務處亦於二○二五年四月至五月聯同澳門特別行政區、馬來西亞、馬爾代夫、新加坡、南韓及泰國警方，進行反詐騙跨境合作平台「FRONTIER+」的首次聯合行動，攜手打擊跨境詐騙犯罪活動。行動成功識別並瓦解多個跨境詐騙網絡，共拘捕1 858人，涉及9 268宗包括投資騙案在內的詐騙案。此外，有見網上投資騙案在二○二五年年初有所增加，香港警方在過去數月不時舉辦記者會，並透過不同渠道加強宣傳，提醒市民保持警惕。

（三）證監會在二○二四年十二月新推出了「咪做水魚」反詐騙宣傳活動，以提醒公眾防範常見的欺詐手法。該活動以證監會的原創卡通角色「水魚」為主角，因其個性衝動又輕易信人，故容易成為投資騙局的受害者。

配合證監會聚焦宣傳公眾應提防的三種常見騙局（網戀投資騙局、偽冒名人陷阱，以及投資「教室」詐騙），證監會推出了一首以「水魚」為主角的原創主題曲及音樂短片，推出後約三個月已吸引超過一百萬次觀看次數。截至二○二五年六月底，證監會已在「水魚」的社交平台上發布了約50篇帖文，吸引超過1 500名追蹤者，並獲得超過423 000名獨立用戶瀏覽。

為了進一步透過「水魚」宣傳防騙訊息，證監會已製作以「水魚」為主題的通訊軟件貼圖，以輕鬆幽默的方式傳遞防騙訊息。除了不同的線上和線下廣告，證監會於二○二五年五月至六月透過港鐵站廣告和電視資訊娛樂節目，加強「咪做水魚」反詐騙宣傳活動，估計觀看人次超過160萬。

事實上，政府一直積極提高市民對各類型騙案的認知以防受騙。警方自二○一七年七月成立「反詐騙協調中心」，協調警隊各相關部門的打擊及預防詐騙工作，並推出了「防騙易18222」24小時電話諮詢熱線、主動識別騙案受害人的「騙案預警」計劃等措施。

此外，警方自二○二○年六月起推出防騙吉祥物「提子」，以親民互動的方式解釋騙徒的最新犯案手法及提供簡單易明的防騙訊息，並在過去五年舉辦多項「提子」防騙宣傳活動。隨着相關宣傳工作的推廣及社會各界的努力下，騙案數字的按年增幅已由二○二○年的近九成，放緩至去年的百分之十一點七，反映市民的防騙意識有所提升。

未來，政府將繼續支持相關機構及持份者合作推出針對性的宣傳活動，以提升公眾的防騙意識。"
LCQ17: Combating online investment scams,2025-07-09 14:30,2025-07-09 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900268.htm," Following is a question by Professor the Hon Priscilla Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 According to the data provided by the Government in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council in June this year, the Police recorded a total of 1 534 cases of online investment scams involving an amount of about $1.02 billion in the first four months of this year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has launched anti-scam publicity and education programmes targeting three common investment scam scenarios, whether the Government has formulated specific measures to support SFC's anti-scam publicity programmes, so as to raise public vigilance against investment scams; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has plans to strengthen its co-operation with the SFC to update and enhance investor education, so as to ensure that investors can effectively identify and guard against emerging investment risks as well as evolving fraudulent practices and technologies; and

(3) whether it has devised further strategies or allocated additional resources to extend the impact of the ""Don't be Sucker"" anti-scam publicity campaign launched by the SFC, so as to enable more investors to benefit from the campaign and avoid becoming victims of online investment scams; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Government attaches great importance to investor education, and is committed to supporting the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and its subsidiary, the Investor and Financial Education Council (IFEC), in enhancing the financial literacy of the public through various means and channels. In consultation with the Security Bureau, the SFC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), my reply to the various parts of the question is as follows.

(1) and (2) In the first five months of 2025, there were 1 849 cases of online investment scams recorded by the Police, involving about $1.24 billion. The Government accords high priority to investor protection, and strives to combat online investment scams through two main directions, namely promotion and enforcement.

 On promotion, the Government, together with the SFC and the IFEC, has been striving to enhance investors' anti-financial scam capabilities, raise the public's knowledge in relevant financial products, and remind investors of the risks associated with digital finance.

 In March 2025, the IFEC in collaboration with various stakeholders organised the ""Hong Kong Money Month"" with the theme of ""Guard against Fraud Thrive with Resilience"" to comprehensively promote anti-scam messages by publicising anti-scam information targeting different segments of the community through cross-media promotion. The promotion videos recorded a total of 20.6 million views during the promotion period. In the face of ever-changing technology and evolving fraud tactics, the IFEC has also introduced various anti-financial scam education resources, animated videos, online seminars, etc to educate the public on safeguarding against investment scams including ""ramp and dump"" schemes, social media investment groups, fraudulent trading apps or investment platforms, impersonation scams, deepfake technology and phishing messages, etc. The IFEC website also features fraud prevention online games and an anti-scam online quiz, enabling the public to gain anti-scam knowledge through engaging and interactive games.

 The IFEC launched Hong Kong's first digital financial education experiential learning centre, the IFEC FinEd Hub, in March 2024 to offer investment and anti-scam education to a wider audience through immersive and interactive learning experiences. The FinEd Hub features various interactive anti-scam games for visitors to learn how to identify and respond to various financial scams. As of end-June 2025, the FinEd Hub has recorded over 26 500 visits, with the vast majority of visitors indicating that their visit had enhanced their anti-scam knowledge.

 On the other hand, the HKMA has introduced ""Money Safe"" with banks to provide an extra layer of security to customers' bank deposits. ""Money Safe"" enables customers to segregate a portion of their deposits maintained at banks, protecting them from fund outflows through online and other channels. When releasing the protected deposits, customers would need to undertake extra verification process by staff at bank branches. All retail banks will fully implement ""Money Safe"" by the end of this year.

 As regards enforcement actions against online investment scams, given that most fraud cases in Hong Kong currently involve the use of stooge accounts for receiving funds, targeting such accounts is an effective way to disrupt the fraud value chain. In the first five months of 2025, the Police arrested a total of 3 028 persons in connection with various fraud and money laundering offences, about 70 per cent of whom were holders of stooge accounts. Since the end of 2023, the Police have also applied to the courts to invoke section 27 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) to seek enhanced penalties for cases involving stooge accounts, so as to strengthen deterrence. There have been cases where convicted stooge account holders received sentences increased by more than 30 per cent.

 The Hong Kong Police Force, together with the police authorities of the Macao Special Administrative Region, Malaysia, Maldives, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand, has also conducted the first joint operation under the anti-fraud cross-boundary co-operation platform ""FRONTIER+"" to jointly combat cross-boundary fraud criminal activity. The operation successfully identified and dismantled multiple cross-boundary fraud syndicates, resulting in the arrest of 1 858 persons and involving 9 268 fraud cases, including investment fraud. In addition, noting the increase in online investment scams at the beginning of 2025, the Hong Kong Police have, over the past few months, held press conferences from time to time and stepped up publicity through various channels to remind the public to remain vigilant.

(3) The SFC launched a new anti-scam campaign ""Don't be Sucker"" in December 2024 to caution the public against common tactics used in fraudulent schemes. An original cartoon character ""Shui Yu"", symbolising an impulsive and gullible personality that easily fall prey to investment scams, debuted in the campaign.

 Complementing the SFC's focused promotion of three common scams that the public should avoid (namely online romance scams, impersonation, and deceptive tips from financial influencers), the SFC has rolled out an original campaign theme song and a music video featuring ""Shui Yu"", which has recorded over one million views within about three months since its launch. As of end-June 2025, the SFC has published about 50 posts on the social media platform of ""Shui Yu"", which has attracted more than 1 500 followers and over 423 000 views by unique users.

 To further promote anti-scam messages through ""Shui Yu"", the SFC has produced ""Shui Yu""-themed messaging app stickers to spread anti-scam messages in a light-hearted way. Apart from various online and offline advertisements, the SFC extended the ""Don't be Sucker"" anti-scam publicity campaign through MTR station commercials and a TV infotainment programme in May to June 2025, garnering more than 1.6 million views in estimate.

 In fact, the Government has been proactively enhancing public awareness of various kinds of scams. The Police have set up the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre since July 2017 to consolidate the efforts of the Police in combating and preventing scams, and have introduced various initiatives including the 24-hour enquiry hotline ""Anti-Scam Helpline 18222"", and the ""Upstream Scam Intervention"" scheme to actively identify potential scam victims.

 In addition, the Police have introduced an anti-scam mascot ""The Little Grape"" since June 2020 to explain the latest tactics of scammers and disseminate simple anti-scam messages in a friendly and interactive manner. Various ""TheLittle Grape"" anti-scam promotional campaigns have also been organised over the past five years. Thanks to these initiatives and the collective efforts of the community, the annual growth rate of scam cases has significantly decelerated from nearly 90 per cent in 2020 to 11.7 per cent last year, indicating a rise in public awareness of scam prevention.

 Going forward, the Government will continue to support relevant organisations and stakeholders in collaboratively launching targeted promotion activities to raise the anti-scam awareness of the public."
立法會三題：路旁環保斗,2025-07-09 14:20,2025-07-09 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900416.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳沛良議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的答覆︰

問題：

有意見認為非法佔用公共道路的路旁環保斗不單影響道路使用者安全，也構成環境衞生問題。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年香港警務處和地政總署就路旁環保斗所採取的執法行動資料，包括接獲的投訴或轉介個案數目、張貼法定通知或向營運商發出警告，以及移走環保斗的數目；當中提出檢控，以及被定罪的個案宗數和有關判罰分別為何；

（二）現時四幅供業界存放環保斗用地的使用情況為何；鑑於政府於二○二三年五月回覆本會質詢時表示，位於將軍澳第137區的存放環保斗用地將成為新社區的一部分，政府將適時作出安排，有關安排的進展為何，包括會否尋覓其他用地供環保斗業界營運；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為規管路旁環保斗涉及多個政府部門，政府會否考慮由指定部門全權負責以提高執法效率；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

建築工地、進行修葺的樓宇及店舖裝修工程等，都會產生建築廢料，然後運往政府的堆填區或填料庫處理。以往沒有環保斗的日子，不少建築地盤和裝修工程產生的廢物在等待運送時需要堆放在路旁，破壞環境整潔衞生之餘，也對附近居民和行人造成滋擾，甚至影響道路安全。環保斗可以存放較大量的廢物，特別是建築廢料。使用環保斗，可以避免廢物四處擺放，有助維持環境整潔衞生和道路安全，亦有助從事建築和裝修的業界人士以較整潔有序的方式處置廢物。

環保斗主要是放置在使用的場地，例如建築地盤、裝修工地、商場、住宅屋苑，或鄰近的指定地點，用以收集在附近樓宇進行裝修或建築工程產生的建築廢料。不在使用中的閒置環保斗，則需要尋找地方放置。根據與業界的問卷調查，香港約有1 500個環保斗，當中約一半需要地方放置，但全港現時只有四幅用地，可以用作存放總共330個閒置環保斗，這導致一些營運者將環保斗擺放在路旁或其他不適當的地方。

環保斗的管理涉及多個政策局和部門。政府通過「管理路旁環保斗聯合工作小組」（工作小組），協調環境及生態局、發展局、運輸及物流局、環境保護署、地政總署、運輸署、路政署、警務處、食物環境衞生署及民政事務總署等部門進行加強管理路旁環保斗的工作。由於放置在路旁的環保斗也是一個地區關注的問題，政務司副司長亦透過跨部門會議，與各相關政策局及部門跟進有關事宜。

就陳沛良議員的提問，經諮詢警務處和地政總署，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）現時，警方根據《簡易程序治罪條例》（第228章）處理涉及路旁環保斗的投訴。警方在過去五年合共接獲5913宗涉及環保斗的投訴。警方執法人員會在現場評估實際情況，在找到環保斗營運者時發出勸喻及／或警告，當中大部分的環保斗在接獲勸喻及／或警告後數小時內由營運商自行移走。另由警方僱用承辦商將環保斗移走的個案數目共五宗。警方以傳票方式作出檢控及定罪的個案數目共18宗，有關人士已被法庭判以罰款300元至9,000元。

地政總署在過去五年合共接獲3674宗涉及環保斗的投訴。當中經部門（包括警務處）轉介的個案平均佔總體約3%，餘下97%為市民投訴。在接到投訴／轉介起兩個工作日內，地政總署會進行實地視察，並根據《土地（雜項條文）條例》（第28章）第6條張貼通知，要求相關人士在不少於一整天的指定限期前，移走環保斗及停止佔用該政府土地，否則會由地政總署的承辦商移走。過去五年，地政總署共移走了27個環保斗，而其餘的環保斗都在限期屆滿前被有關人士自行移走。

（二）正如上述，香港估計約有1 500個環保斗，考慮工作輪轉等因素，業界估計每天約有600至700個閒置環保斗需要地方擺放。現時政府透過短期租約機制，為業界提供四幅用地用作存放閒置環保斗，分別位於百勝角、將軍澳第137區填料庫旁、屯門小冷水和毗鄰青衣青南街的用地，合共提供330個泊位。其中，位於百勝角的用地可存放約110個環保斗；位於將軍澳第137區填料庫旁的用地可存放約120個環保斗；位於屯門小冷水的用地可存放約80個環保斗；而位於青衣青南街的用地可存放約20個環保斗。

為配合將軍澳第137區未來發展成住宅社區，按照目前的工程時間表，用作存放環保斗的短期租約用地預計最早須於二○二六年第二季歸還。另一方面，政府已完成位於大嶼山青洲灣的用地的公開招標程序，初步預計該用地可存放約100個環保斗，預計於今年內批出。為協助改善一些營運者將環保斗擺放在路旁或其他不適當的地方的情況，工作小組會努力尋找其他及更多合適用地以短期租約方式租予環保斗營運業界存放閒置環保斗。

（三）管理在路旁擺放環保斗的工作，涉及不同部門的工作和法例，政府通過工作小組，協調有關部門的工作，是有其原因和需要。政府會多管齊下，尋求更有效的管理辦法改善環保斗不當擺放的問題。現階段，政府會針對違規放在路旁並且對道路安全造成風險的個案加強執法行動。

多謝主席。"
LCQ3: Roadside skips,2025-07-09 14:20,2025-07-09 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900417.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Pui-leung and a reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

There are views that roadside skips unlawfully occupying public roads not only affects the safety of road users, but also poses environmental hygiene problems. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the information on the enforcement actions taken by the Hong Kong Police Force and the Lands Department against roadside skips in the past five years, including the number of complaints or referrals received, the number of statutory notices posted or warnings issued to operators, as well as the number of skips removed; among them, the number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted and the number of convicted cases, as well as the relevant penalties imposed;

(2) of the current utilisation situations of the four sites made available for use by the trade for storing skips; as the Government indicated in its reply to a question raised by this Council in May 2023 that the skip storage site in Tseung Kwan O Area 137 would become part of the new community, and that the Government would make arrangements in due course, of the progress of the relevant arrangements, including whether alternative sites will be identified for the operation of the skips trade; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that the regulation of roadside skips involves a number of government departments, whether the Government will consider assigning a designated department to take full responsibility so as to improve enforcement efficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Construction waste is generated from construction sites, buildings under maintenance and shops under renovation, which is then transported to landfills or public fill banks for handling. Before skips emerged in the market, most construction waste from construction and renovation sites were piled up at roadside before it was collected for delivery. This not only affected the environmental hygiene, but also caused nuisance to residents and pedestrians, and even affected the road safety. Skips could store relatively large quantity of waste, in particular, construction waste. Using skips can avoid waste being placed everywhere and help maintain a clean and hygienic environment and road safety. It also helps the construction and renovation industry handle construction waste in a neat and orderly way.

Skips are primarily placed at site of use, such as construction sites, renovation sites, shopping malls, housing estates and designated locations nearby, to collect construction waste generated by construction or renovation works in the buildings nearby. Skips that are not being used need to be stored. According to the result of a questionnaire survey with the trade, there are about 1 500 roadside skips in Hong Kong. Among these, about half of them need to be stored while there is only storage space for 330 skips on four pieces of land provided. Under such a circumstance, some skip operators may place the skips at roadside or other improper locations.

Management of skips involves various bureaux and departments. Through the Joint Working Group on Management of Roadside Skips (Working Group), the Government coordinates the work on enhancing management of roadside skips among the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Environmental Protection Department, the Lands Department (LandsD), the Transport Department, the Highways Department, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, and the Home Affairs Department. Since skips placed on at roadside is also a problem of district concern, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration also looks into this problem with the bureaux and departments concerned through inter-departmental meetings.

In response to the question raised by the Hon Chan Pui-leung, in consultation with the HKPF and the LandsD, a consolidated reply is as follows:

(1) Currently, the HKPF handles complaints involving roadside skips in accordance with the Summary Offences Ordinance (Cap. 228). Over the past five years, the HKPF has received a total of 5913 complaints about skips. Police officers will, in light of the circumstances at the scene, make assessments and issue advice and/or warnings to the skip operators concerned if found. In most cases, the operators would remove the skips on their own within hours after receiving the advice and/or warning, with five cases requiring the HKPF to engage contractors to remove the skips. A total of 18 cases were prosecuted under police summons and were convicted. The convicted persons were fined between $300 and $9,000 by the court.

Over the past five years, the LandsD has received a total of 3674 complaints concerning skips. Among these complaints, 3 per cent were referred by other departments (including the HKPF), and the other 97 per cent were lodged by the public. Within two working days upon receiving a complaint or referral, the LandsD will conduct an on-site inspection and post a notice according to Section 6 of the Land (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 28) requiring the person concerned to remove the skip and to stop occupying the government land before the specified deadline no less than one clear day, otherwise it will be removed by the LandsD's contractor. Over the past five years, the LandsD has removed a total of 27 skips, with the remaining removed by relevant persons on their own before the deadlines.

(2) As mentioned above, there are about 1 500 skips in Hong Kong. Considering factors such as job rotations, the trade estimates that about 600 to 700 idling skips would require space for storage each day. At present, the Government has provided four sites to the trade for storage of idling skips through short-term tenancy mechanism. These sites are located at Pak Shing Kok, an area next to the Tseung Kwan O Area 137 (TKO 137) Fill Bank, Siu Lang Shui in Tuen Mun, and adjacent to Tsing Nam Street in Tsing Yi respectively, altogether providing storage space for a total of 330 skips. The site at Pak Shing Kok can store about 110 skips; the site next to the TKO 137 Fill Bank can store about 120 skips; the site at Siu Lang Shui in Tuen Mun can store about 80 skips; and the site at Tsing Nam Street in Tsing Yi can store about 20 skips.

To tie in with the future residential development of TKO 137, according to the current development timetable, the site leased to the trade under short-term tenancy for storing skips is expected to be returned in the second quarter of 2026 the earliest. Meanwhile, the Government has completed the open tendering process for a site at Tsing Chau Wan on Lantau Island, which is initially expected to accommodate approximately 100skips and to be awarded within this year. To further improve the situation that some skip operators placed their skips at roadside or other improper locations, the Working Group also strives to find more suitable sites for skip storage by the trade through short-term tenancy tenders.

(3)The management of roadside skips involves works of different departments and various pieces of legislation. Hence, the Government has its reason and need to coordinate relevant departments' work through the Working Group. The Government is adopting a multipronged approach and looking for more effective ways to improve the problem of improper placement of skips. At the current stage, the Government focuses on enhancing enforcement on illegally placed skips that pose safety risk to road users.

Thank you, President."
Speech by FS at Korea-Hong Kong Business Luncheon (English only) (with photos/video),2025-07-09 14:08,2025-07-09 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900535.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Korea–Hong Kong Business Luncheon held in Seoul, Korea, today (July 9):

Mr Joo Yong-tae (Deputy Mayor for Economy, Seoul), Mr Kevin Lee (Director of the International Trade Division of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Annyeonghaseyo. Good afternoon. It is both a pleasure and honour to be here with you today in Seoul.

 Let me begin by extending my warmest greetings and heartfelt appreciation to the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry and our ETO (Economic and Trade Office) colleagues for organising this luncheon.

Hong Kong: good for business

 Allow me to start by offering a brief snapshot of where Hong Kong stands today.

 Hong Kong has been back on a path of growth following the global challenges of the pandemic. In 2024, we recorded a GDP growth of 2.5 per cent. This year, despite continued global uncertainties from tariff war to geopolitical tensions, our economy recorded a 3.1 per cent growth in the first quarter. Our merchandise exports continued to register strong double-digit growth.

 Foreign businesses continue to cast a vote of confidence in our city. In 2024, the number of overseas and Mainland companies operating in Hong Kong reached an all-time high at nearly 10 000. American and European companies rose by around 10 per cent, while Korean companies rose by 9 per cent year on year. 

 Hong Kong continues to shine in international rankings. We are among the world’s top three global financial centres. The latest IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Ranking places us as the third most competitive economy worldwide. Last October, the Fraser Institute reaffirmed our position as the world’s freest economy. These accolades are no coincidence. They are the result of persistent hard work to drive our competitiveness forward, backed by transparent, consistent and predictable policies, market openness and global connectivity.

 A critical foundation of our success is a stable and secure environment. This year marks the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law. It restores law and order in Hong Kong and provides confidence to the international business community. Indeed, a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce (in Hong Kong) in January this year showed that (more than) 80 per cent of its members expressed confidence in Hong Kong’s rule of law. And 70 per cent reported that the National Security Law had no impact on their business operations.

 Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong continues to be an open, diverse and international city. We are a free port, uphold a freely convertible currency pegged to the US dollar, ensure the free flow of capital, goods, information and talent, and practise the common law system.

 President Xi Jinping and the Central Government of China have made clear that the ""one country, two systems"" framework is here to stay for the long term.

 Investor confidence is reflected in hard data. Our stock market, for example, rose by 18 per cent last year, and has gained another 20 per cent this year. Initial public offerings (IPOs) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have raised about US$16 billion so far this year, making Hong Kong the top IPO venue globally to date. The total bank deposits grew by 7 per cent last year and another 7 per cent this year, now exceeding US$2.3 trillion, six times our GDP.

The Greater Bay Area

 Meanwhile, Hong Kong is the international gateway to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, or GBA, which is an economic powerhouse with 87 million people and a combined GDP of US$2 trillion. With a per capita GDP of US$23,000, or US$40,000 on a purchasing power parity basis, the GBA is not just a manufacturing base, but also a sophisticated, high-growth consumer market.

 The region is deeply interconnected. High-speed rail puts us just 15 minutes from Shenzhen and 45 minutes from Guangzhou. With seven international airports and a combined annual passenger throughput of over 200 million, the GBA sits within a five-hour flight radius of half the world’s population. Hong Kong International Airport, the world’s busiest cargo airport, now operates with a third runway and is gearing up to handle 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2035.

 The GBA is also a cradle of innovation. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster ranks second globally in innovation, and has done so for five consecutive years. Hong Kong excels in basic research, anchored by five universities ranked among the world's top 100. Three of them are in the global top 20 for data science and AI; our two medical schools are ranked among the top 40. Meanwhile, Shenzhen and Guangzhou lead in commercialisation and advanced manufacturing. Together, the GBA is like fusing the financial power of New York with the innovation energy of Silicon Valley.

Opportunities for Korean businesses

 So, what does this mean for Korean businesses?

 First, Hong Kong’s financial markets offer unparalleled connectivity and liquidity. We serve as a two-way platform, connecting international capital with Mainland markets and vice versa. Through our Connect Schemes, including Stock Connect, Bond Connect, and ETF (Exchange-traded Fund) Connect, and more, Mainland investors can access Hong Kong’s markets, while global investors can access the Mainland through Hong Kong.

 The recent surge in our stock market reflects two important trends. First, the rebalancing act of international investors to diversify risks out of global economic uncertainty, particularly in the US; and second, optimism about China's technology prowess demonstrated by DeepSeek and others. Korean investors have already taken note. And they are apt in taking actions. In February this year, we saw the highest level of Korean investment into our stock market in over three years.

 Beyond the stock market, asset and wealth management is another area where we are seeing rapid growth. Hong Kong now manages over US$4 trillion in assets. With a growing ecosystem of related financial services, we are on track to become the world’s largest cross-border wealth management hub by 2028. For Korean firms in private banking and asset management, the opportunities are significant. Indeed, many American and European asset and wealth managers have been expanding their hiring and office accommodation in the city.

 Hong Kong also serves as a powerful springboard for Korean goods, not just into the GBA or the Chinese Mainland, but across the entire ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region. As a duty-free port with seamless customs clearance and unmatched connectivity, Hong Kong offers Korean exporters a fast, cost-effective and reliable route to high-growth markets. From electronics and cosmetics to food products and fashion, Hong Kong is your launchpad.

 In innovation and technology, Hong Kong is making strategic and forward-looking moves. We are placing particular emphasis on the development of key sectors such as artificial intelligence and biotech. In addition to our world-class research capabilities, Hong Kong is where Mainland and international data converge. This is a distinct competitive advantage for data-intensive industries. 

 Our close collaboration with other cities in the GBA is further accelerating this momentum. Along our boundary with neighbouring Shenzhen, we are developing a joint innovation and technology park, where we are piloting innovative policies to facilitate the seamless flow of data, talent, capital and even biosamples. We have also established joint clinical trial centres to expedite drug development and streamline cross-boundary regulatory approvals. For Korean tech and pharmaceutical firms seeking expansion and collaboration opportunities, Hong Kong is your ideal location.

The pleasures of life

 Beyond business, Hong Kong is a city alive with culture, diversity, and global connectivity. We are a true melting pot of East and West. Korean culture, from K-pop to kimchi, has found a warm and enthusiastic following in Hong Kong. And we are glad that more and more Korean visitors are coming to our city to see for themselves our vibrancy. In the first half of this year, Hong Kong welcomes more than half a million of Korean visitors, a 25 per cent increase year on year.

 The pleasures of life are part of our fabric. With more than 200 Michelin-recognised restaurants, hiking trails minutes from the city, and a coastline that rivals the best in the region, Hong Kong offers not only opportunity, but quality of life. Above all, Hong Kong remains one of the safest cities in the world, a place you can walk freely, day or night.

 And we are just getting started. The newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park offers a world-class, multipurpose venue for sport and entertainment events. In January next year, we’re excited to welcome BLACKPINK to our stage. And who knows, NewJeans and aespa may not be far behind!

 Ladies and gentlemen, I hope I've been able to offer you a fresh perspective on Hong Kong, not just as a financial centre or trade hub, but as a dynamic, welcoming city filled with opportunity, energy and creativity. A city where Korean businesses, investors and talents can thrive.

 If I may, let me now share a short video that captures the vibrancy, openness and possibilities of Hong Kong today.

 That is Hong Kong - dynamic and welcoming. A city that means business, and a city that celebrates life. We look forward to welcoming you soon, to Hong Kong.

 Kamsahamnida. Thank you very much."

Meanwhile, Shenzhen and Guangzhou lead in commercialisation and advanced manufacturing. Together, the GBA is like fusing the financial power of New York with the innovation energy of Silicon Valley.

Opportunities for Korean businesses

 So, what does this mean for Korean businesses?

 First, Hong Kong’s financial markets offer unparalleled connectivity and liquidity. We serve as a two-way platform, connecting international capital with Mainland markets and vice versa. Through our Connect Schemes, including Stock Connect, Bond Connect, and ETF (Exchange-traded Fund) Connect, and more, Mainland investors can access Hong Kong’s markets, while global investors can access the Mainland through Hong Kong.

 The recent surge in our stock market reflects two important trends. First, the rebalancing act of international investors to diversify risks out of global economic uncertainty, particularly in the US; and second, optimism about China's technology prowess demonstrated by DeepSeek and others. Korean investors have already taken note. And they are apt in taking actions. In February this year, we saw the highest level of Korean investment into our stock market in over three years.

 Beyond the stock market, asset and wealth management is another area where we are seeing rapid growth. Hong Kong now manages over US$4 trillion in assets. With a growing ecosystem of related financial services, we are on track to become the world’s largest cross-border wealth management hub by 2028. For Korean firms in private banking and asset management, the opportunities are significant. Indeed, many American and European asset and wealth managers have been expanding their hiring and office accommodation in the city.

 Hong Kong also serves as a powerful springboard for Korean goods, not just into the GBA or the Chinese Mainland, but across the entire ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region. As a duty-free port with seamless customs clearance and unmatched connectivity, Hong Kong offers Korean exporters a fast, cost-effective and reliable route to high-growth markets. From electronics and cosmetics to food products and fashion, Hong Kong is your launchpad.

 In innovation and technology, Hong Kong is making strategic and forward-looking moves. We are placing particular emphasis on the development of key sectors such as artificial intelligence and biotech. In addition to our world-class research capabilities, Hong Kong is where Mainland and international data converge. This is a distinct competitive advantage for data-intensive industries. 

 Our close collaboration with other cities in the GBA is further accelerating this momentum. Along our boundary with neighbouring Shenzhen, we are developing a joint innovation and technology park, where we are piloting innovative policies to facilitate the seamless flow of data, talent, capital and even biosamples. We have also established joint clinical trial centres to expedite drug development and streamline cross-boundary regulatory approvals. For Korean tech and pharmaceutical firms seeking expansion and collaboration opportunities, Hong Kong is your ideal location.

The pleasures of life

 Beyond business, Hong Kong is a city alive with culture, diversity, and global connectivity. We are a true melting pot of East and West. Korean culture, from K-pop to kimchi, has found a warm and enthusiastic following in Hong Kong. And we are glad that more and more Korean visitors are coming to our city to see for themselves our vibrancy. In the first half of this year, Hong Kong welcomes more than half a million of Korean visitors, a 25 per cent increase year on year.

 The pleasures of life are part of our fabric. With more than 200 Michelin-recognised restaurants, hiking trails minutes from the city, and a coastline that rivals the best in the region, Hong Kong offers not only opportunity, but quality of life. Above all, Hong Kong remains one of the safest cities in the world, a place you can walk freely, day or night.

 And we are just getting started. The newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park offers a world-class, multipurpose venue for sport and entertainment events. In January next year, we’re excited to welcome BLACKPINK to our stage. And who knows, NewJeans and aespa may not be far behind!

 Ladies and gentlemen, I hope I've been able to offer you a fresh perspective on Hong Kong, not just as a financial centre or trade hub, but as a dynamic, welcoming city filled with opportunity, energy and creativity. A city where Korean businesses, investors and talents can thrive.

 If I may, let me now share a short video that captures the vibrancy, openness and possibilities of Hong Kong today.

 That is Hong Kong - dynamic and welcoming. A city that means business, and a city that celebrates life. We look forward to welcoming you soon, to Hong Kong.

 Kamsahamnida. Thank you very much."
​政府調整交通相關費用和定額罰款,2025-07-09 13:32,2025-07-09 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900333.htm,"政府今日（七月九日）宣布，建議調整四項與交通相關的費用，包括隧道收費、電動私家車牌照費、停車收費錶最高收費，以及交通違例事項定額罰款。

運輸及物流局發言人說：「二零二五至二六年度《財政預算案》公布政府會重點檢視多年未曾調整的交通收費和定額罰款。我們的總體考量是提升交通管理，以及維持公共財政紀律，以體現『收回成本』和『用者自付』原則。」

為此，政府制定合共四項法例修訂：

（一）《2025年行車隧道（政府）（修訂）（第2號）規例》──調整隧道收費

政府以科學為本，以四大原則按優次檢視了政府隧道和主幹道的收費，包括交通管理需要、效率優先、公共交通優先，以及「用者自付」。在綜合考慮上述四項原則和每條隧道和主幹道的具體情況，決定建議調高香港仔隧道和城門隧道的隧道費，並就使用中九龍繞道徵收隧道費。香港仔隧道和城門隧道的新收費將於二○二五年九月二十一日生效；中九龍繞道將於二○二六年全線通車時，開始實施收費。詳情如下：





現行隧道費
			（所有車輛全日劃一收費）
建議隧道費
			（所有車輛全日劃一收費）


香港仔隧道
5元
8元


城門隧道
5元
8元


中九龍繞道（油麻地段隧道）
／
8元




運輸及物流局發言人說：「香港仔隧道和城門隧道已34年未有調整收費，至今通脹已超過百分之一百三十，隧道出現營運虧損。調整收費至8元對交通造成的影響輕微，隧道營運可因此達致收支平衡。另一方面，中九龍繞道將紓緩現時九龍主要幹道的交通，路程短、車速高，對駕駛者的吸引力甚大。如中九龍繞道不予收費，預計剛開通使用率便將接近飽和。考慮到立法會交通事務委員會及回應社會意見，並吸引更多駕駛者使用，以達致有效分流，政府現提出8元收費。相關收費水平將有效分流九龍區內主要繁忙道路整體約百分之二十的車流之餘，亦能為繞道保留約百分之十五的剩餘容車量以應付未來交通增長，並可收回近八成的基本營運成本；而按效率優先原則，商用車輛和公交車輛須繳付的費用與體積較小的私家車的溫和收費一致。」

發言人續指：「我們亦已按上述四項原則逐一審視其他政府隧道及主幹道。總括而言，考慮到其他政府隧道及主幹道的交通管理和流量、替代路線的交通流量，以及與每條路線相關未來的交通基建配套，例如新的替代路線落成，我們建議暫時維持它們現有的收費安排，適時再作檢視。」

（二）《2025年道路交通（車輛登記及領牌）（修訂）（第4號）規例》──理順電動私家車牌照費架構和水平

現時，電動私家車的牌照費按車輛淨重收費，電動私家車的牌照費與燃油私家車的牌照費之間的差距為約六倍。政府建議調整電動私家車每年牌照費的收費架構，改以電動私家車的額定功率收取牌照費，把電動私家車的牌照費結構按額定功率分為五個層級，並適當地調整牌照費水平，調整進程會分五階段在六年間進行，以配合科技發展和緊貼其他地區做法。新牌照費架構將於二○二五年十一月一日起實施，適用於新登記的電動私家車，而現有電動私家車可獲四個月寬限期。詳情撮述如下：

			＊四個月的牌照費用為相關每年牌照費的百分之三十五，以及附加費30元。




擁有電動私家車的合資格傷殘人士會獲得電動私家車牌照費寬減安排（註）。

運輸及物流局發言人說：「考慮到立法會交通事務委員會的意見，電動私家車的牌照費調整分五階段逐步實施，讓市民有較長的適應期。新的電動私家車牌照費水平完成調整後，與現時燃油車的牌照費比較，仍會低百分之二十五（第五層級）至百分之四十（第一層級）不等，以繼續鼓勵駕駛者轉用電動車，推動環保。按現時登記電動私家車的類型分布，有百分之九十九的車輛處於第一、二及三層級；而處於第四及第五層級的車輛數目比例僅分別為百分之一和百分之零點一。隨着電動車日趨普及，市場上有越來越多電動車品牌和型號選擇，同時電動車燃料費用及維修保養費較燃油車低，我們預計在新措施下，電動車仍維持吸引力。」

（三）《2025年道路交通（泊車）（修訂）規例》──調整停車收費錶收費

為妥善運用有限的泊車位資源，政府建議調整使用停車收費錶泊車位（俗稱「咪錶」）的最高收費，由每15分鐘2元調整至每15分鐘4元，即每小時最高收費為16元，以加快停車收費錶泊車位的流轉，滿足駕駛者短期泊車需求。新收費將於二○二五年九月二十八日起實施。至於貨車、巴士及旅遊巴士泊車位的現有收費錶收費水平，一律維持不變。

（四）根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》（第237章）和《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》（第240章）動議的擬議決議案──調整交通違例事項定額罰款

為加強保障交通安全和交通暢順，政府建議違例泊車的定額罰款額由現時320元調高至400元（調整幅度為百分之二十五），其他與道路安全和交通擠塞相關的十九項（詳見附件）違例事項的定額罰款額由現時的320元至1,000元不等，調高至480元至1,500元不等（調整幅度為百分之五十）。其他交通罪行的罰款額則維持不變。

運輸及物流局發言人說：「違例泊車和大部分交通違例事項的定額罰款已31年未曾調整，罰款額的阻嚇力或因期間的通脹而有所抵銷；而事實上，香港的交通違例事項的定額罰款水平遠較多個其他地區為低。我們注意到部分交通罪行數字仍有上升或居高不下的趨勢。調整相關交通罪行的罰款額有助提高阻嚇力，加強保障道路安全和暢順。與此同時，政府會致力加大泊車位供應，以盡量滿足泊車需求。」

《2025年行車隧道（政府）（修訂）（第2號）規例》、《2025年道路交通（車輛登記及領牌）（修訂）（第4號）規例》，以及《2025年道路交通（泊車）（修訂）規例》將於七月十八日刊憲，並於七月二十三日提交立法會進行先訂立後審議的程序。至於《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》（第237章）和《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》（第240章）附表的交通違例事項的罰則，立法會可藉決議修訂（按先審議後訂立的程序），運輸及物流局局長將於七月三十日的立法會會議上動議通過決議。有關立法建議和生效日期分別在各修訂規例及擬議決議案中訂明，相關資料載列於政府於今日發出的立法會參考資料摘要。

註：如合資格傷殘人士名下電動私家車的額定功率不超過75千瓦，則無須繳付牌照費。如其額定功率超過75千瓦，其應繳每年牌照費為其額定功率層級訂明的每年牌照費減去額定功率不超過75千瓦的電動私家車所應繳的每年牌照費。"

答覆：

主席：

為應對院舍人手不足和新增的人手需求，以及協助院舍業界提升服務質素，政府二○二三年六月推出「院舍輸入護理員特別計劃」（「特別計劃」），在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，適度容許安老院及殘疾人士院舍輸入護理員。「特別計劃」推出時設有7000個輸入配額，包括原有經「補充勞工計劃」已輸入的約4000名護理員。有關名額於二○二四年上半年接近用罄。政府在檢視業界對護理員的需求和人手供應情況後，同年七月公布把配額上限提高至15000個，在隨後三年分批提供予院舍申請。

就議員的提問，綜合社會福利署（社署）、勞工處及政府統計處（統計處）的資料及數據，現答覆如下：

（一）至（三）過去三年全港安老院及殘疾人士院舍所聘用的本地及輸入護理員人數載於附件一。「特別計劃」首五輪的申請和審批結果詳情載於附件二，其中約400宗個案遭拒絕，不獲批的主要原因包括該輪申請可獲分配的配額已用罄或申請不符合「特別計劃」的規定。第六輪申請在二○二五年五月六日截止，社署正處理約500個新配額申請。

社署有五名人員專責推行「特別計劃」，包括社會工作主任職系、行政主任職系及文書職系的人員。為保障本地勞工的就業機會，社署會抽查申請參與「特別計劃」的院舍所遞交的「本地招聘確認書」，確保院舍已經通過社署署長指定途徑招聘本地人手，但未能填補空缺。至二○二五年三月，社署共抽查約300份院舍本地招聘記錄，佔申請總數超過一成，沒有發現院舍蓄意或存心提交不正確資料，該段期間也沒有院舍遭行政制裁。

（四）至（六）勞工處共有37名勞工督察負責巡查輸入勞工的工作地點及僱主在香港為輸入勞工提供的居所。過去兩年，勞工督察共進行4407次有關輸入護理員的巡查（包括補充勞工計劃／優化補充勞工計劃以及「特別計劃」下的個案），包括2298次僱傭地點巡查及2109次居所巡查。巡查如發現輸入勞工的僱傭權益受損，勞工處會立即跟進調查。視察巡查過程中收到的投訴已計入整體投訴個案數字。

自二○二三年六月推出「特別計劃」至二○二五年五月，勞工處和社署共接獲47宗懷疑院舍違反法例或「特別計劃」規定的投訴。投訴事項主要涉及工資（包括工資回扣及短付工資）及工作安排。上述投訴個案中，有八宗涉及院舍涉嫌以輸入護理員取代在職本地護理員，其中七‍宗投訴已完成調查，並沒有發現違規事項，而餘下一宗仍在調查中。同期，勞工處成功檢控一名在「特別計劃」下聘用輸入護理員的僱主，該僱主違反《僱員補償條例》，未有投購有效的僱員補償保險，被法庭判處罰款2,500元。社署正審視有關個案，會按情況考慮施加行政制裁。

自「特別計劃」推出至今，投訴、檢控及定罪個案的數字按年表列如下：

（七）「特別計劃」規定，本地護理員的薪金必須不低於輸入護理員，而輸入護理員的薪金不得低於統計處最新編製的護理員每月工資中位數（註一）。護理員每月中位工資根據統計處在五月至六月期間進行的「收入及工時按年統計調查」所搜集的數據編製而成，統計處多年來均沿用此方式統計不同行業的工資中位數。就院舍護理員的工資中位數而言，抽樣的院舍包括津助／合約和私營／自負盈虧安老院。

鑑於津助／合約院舍一般可提供更好的薪酬待遇吸引本地求職者，政府推出「特別計劃」時，規定這類院舍須採用較低的輸入護理員比例，即每聘請兩名全職本地員工才可申請輸入一名外地護理員（即2：1），而私營／自負盈虧院舍的適用比例則為1：1。至二○二五年六月底，社署向院舍業界共批出約8300個配額（包括續約配額），當中津助／合約院舍所佔的配額約兩成，而私營／自負盈虧院舍則佔近八成。此外，根據「特別計劃」的規定，僱主只可在未能招聘本地護理員的情況下申請輸入外地護理員。院舍業界普遍認為申請輸入護理員的門檻和實際成本不低。獲准輸入護理員的僱主須為輸入護理員提供住宿。輸入護理員如生病或受傷，無論是否因受僱而引致，僱主須提供免費醫療服務。如僱主為輸入護理員提供膳食，則必須是免費的。院舍亦須為每名輸入護理員每月繳付$400「僱員再培訓徵款」。

註一：根據統計處最新數字，二○二四年護理員每月中位工資為$15,120元（以最近的十位數顯示）。"

(3)since the implementation of the Special Scheme, of the following information on the spot checks conducted by the authorities on applicant RCHs in accordance with the mechanism of spot checks of local recruitment records during the processing of each round of application: (i) the staffing establishment and strength of personnel conducting the spot checks, (ii) the number of RCHs which had been requested by the Social Welfare Department in its letters to submit detailed local recruitment records, and (iii) their percentage in the total number of applicant RCHs; whether the authorities had found malpractices such as RCHs being suspected of having provided false information or withheld any information during such spot checks; if so, of the details, including the number and nature of the cases, and whether the authorities had imposed administrative sanctions on or instituted prosecutions against the RCHs concerned, together with a breakdown by type of RCHs and their mode of operation;

(4)given that according to the requirements of the Special Scheme, RCHs must not displace their existing local care workers with imported care workers and they must comply with the specified ratio of local employees to imported care workers, of the number of RCHs alleged or substantiated to have breached the aforesaid requirements since the implementation of the Special Scheme, as well as the details of the relevant follow-up actions (including the number of cases in which written warnings were issued to and administrative sanctions were imposed on non-compliant RCHs), together with a breakdown by type of RCHs and their mode of operation;

(5)since the implementation of the Special Scheme, of the following information on the authorities' inspections of the workplaces and accommodations of imported care workers provided by employers in Hong Kong: (i) the staffing establishment and strength of personnel conducting the inspections, (ii) the number of inspections conducted, (iii) the number of workplaces inspected and (iv) the number of accommodations provided by employers which were inspected;

(6) since the implementation of the Special Scheme, of the respective numbers of complaints involving the exploitation of labour rights of imported care workers received by the Government (i) during the inspections mentioned in (5) and (ii) through other channels, and the main nature of such complaints; the respective numbers of administrative sanctions imposed on or prosecutions instituted against the RCHs concerned by the authorities in respect of the complaints received by ways of (i) and (ii), together with a breakdown by type of RCHs and their mode of operation; among the prosecutions instituted, the number of convicted cases and the average penalty imposed; and

(7) as there are views pointing out that the median wage currently stipulated for imported care workers in RCHs under the Special Scheme is lower than the market level, and that the remuneration of local care workers employed by subvented RCHs is in general much higher than the median wage, resulting in less motivation for RCHs to employ local workers, whether the authorities will consider stipulating appropriate median wages for imported care workers in RCHs with different modes of operation, so as to enhance protection for local care workers concerned; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 To address the manpower shortage and new manpower demand in residential care homes (RCHs), and to assist the RCH sector in enhancing their service quality, the Government, on the premise of safeguarding the employment priority for local workers, launched the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for RCHs (the Special Scheme) in June 2023 to allow residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) and residential care homes for persons with disabilities (RCHDs) to import care workers on an appropriate scale. The Special Scheme set 7000 importation quotas when launched, including around 4000 care workers previously imported through the Supplementary Labour Scheme (SLS), and the relevant quotas were nearly exhausted by the first half of 2024. The Government, having reviewed the demand for and supply of care workers in the sector, announced in July of the same year that the quota ceiling would be adjusted to 15000 for RCHs to apply for by batches in the following three years.

 Our reply to the Member's questions, with consolidated information and data of the Social Welfare Department (SWD), Labour Department (LD) and Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), is as follows:

(1) to (3)The number of local and imported care workers employed by the RCHEs and the RCHDs in Hong Kong in the past three years are set out at Annex 1. The details of the first five rounds of applications and approval results under the Special Scheme are set out at Annex 2, with about 400 rejected cases mainly because the quotas available for that round of applications were exhausted, or the applications did not comply with the requirements of the Special Scheme. The sixth round of applications ended on May 6, 2025, and the SWD is processing the applications for around 500 new quotas.

 There are five staff members in the SWD designated to implement the Special Scheme, including the Social Work Officer grade, the Executive Officer grade and the Clerical grade. To safeguard job opportunities of local care workers, the SWD will conduct random checks on the ""Confirmation of Local Recruitment"" submitted by the RCHs that apply for joining the Special Scheme, with a view to ensuring that they have conducted local recruitment through channel(s) specified by the Director of Social Welfare but have been unsuccessful in filling the vacancies. Up to March 2025, the SWD has conducted random checks on about 300 local recruitment records of the RCHs, accounting for more than 10 per cent of the total number of applications, and found no case of RCH's intentionally or knowingly submitting inaccurate information. Nor has any RCH been imposed administrative sanction during that period of time.

(4) to (6)The LD's Labour Inspectors (LIs) inspect the workplaces of imported workers and the accommodation provided by employers in Hong Kong for imported workers. The establishment and strength of the LIs responsible for the above work is 37. In the past two years, LIs have carried out a total of 4407 inspections relating to imported care workers (including cases under the SLS/Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) and the Special Scheme), including 2298 workplace inspections and 2109 accommodation inspections. Should suspected deprivation of imported workers' rights and benefits be detected during inspection, the LD will promptly conduct follow-up investigation. Complaints received during the inspections are counted towards the overall number of complaint cases.

  Since the launch of the Special Scheme in June 2023 and up to May 2025, the LD and the SWD have received a total of 47 complaints against the RCHs suspected to have breached the law or the requirements of the Special Scheme. The complaints mainly involved wages (including wage rebates and underpayment of wages) and work arrangements. Among them, there were eight complaints received about the displacement of serving local care workers by imported care workers, of which the Government has completed investigation of seven cases and no irregularities were found. The remaining one case is still under investigation. During the same period, the LD successfully prosecuted an employer that had engaged imported care workers under the Special Scheme. The employer violated the Employees' Compensation Ordinance by failing to take out employees' compensation insurance policies and was fined $2,500 by the court. The SWD is examining the case concerned and will consider imposing administrative sanctions as appropriate.

  Since the launch of the Special Scheme, the number of complaint, prosecution and conviction cases per year are tabulated as follows:

(7) The Special Scheme requires that the salary of local care workers must not be lower than those offered to imported care workers, while the salary of imported care workers must not be lower than the latest median monthly wage of care workers (Note 1) as compiled by the C&SD. The median monthly wage of care workers are compiled based on the data obtained from C&SD's Annual Earnings and Hours Survey conducted between May and June. The C&SD has been compiling statistics on the median wages of various industries based on this approach over the years. In respect of the median wage of care workers at RCHs, institutions being sampled include subvented/contract and private/self-financing RCHEs.

  As subvented/contract RCHs can generally offer better remuneration packages to attract local job-seekers, the Government has stipulated that these types of RCHs should adopt a lower ratio of imported care workers when launching the Special Scheme. They are only allowed to, for every two full-time local staff employed, apply for importing one non-local care worker (i.e. 2:1) whereas private/self-financing RCHs can apply to import one non-local care worker for every full-time local employee (i.e. 1:1). Up to end June 2025, the SWD has approved a total of about 8 300 quotas (including contract renewal quotas) for the RCH sector, of which the quotas for subvented/contract RCHs accounted for about 20 per cent while those for private/self-financing RCHs accounted for nearly 80 per cent. In addition, under the Special Scheme, employers may only apply for importation of care workers if they are unable to recruit local care workers. The sector generally opined that the threshold and actual cost of applying to import care workers are not as low. Employers who are allowed to import care workers must provide accommodation for the imported care workers. If an imported care worker becomes ill or injured, regardless of whether that is work-related, his or her employer is required to offer free medical services. The meals for imported care workers, if so provided by an employer, must be free of charge. The RCHs also must pay a monthly ""Employee Retraining Levy"" of $400 per imported care worker. 

Note 1: According to the latest figure of C&SD, the median monthly wage of care workers in 2024 was $15,120 (rounding to the nearest tenth)."

立法會四題：釋放「銀色生產動力」,2025-07-09 12:30,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900299.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上林振昇議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

政府於今年五月公布各項促進銀髮經濟措施，有意見認為在釋放「銀色生產動力」方面，當局應推出更多措施協助基層長者解決就業困難和改善待遇。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於不少基層長者反映在目前輸入勞工政策下，僱主傾向聘用較年輕外勞，令長者的工作機會減少，特別是「補充勞工優化計劃」涵蓋的工種，政府會否考慮收緊該計劃，例如就所有工種設立配額上限，以提升長者就業機會；

（二）鑑於有年長求職者反映，即使符合職位要求，但有僱主表明因其年齡較大而拒絕聘請，當局會否積極研究立法，打擊職場年齡歧視；及

（三）政府於二○二三年建議提高僱主為65歲或以上僱員作強積金自願性供款的稅務扣減，鼓勵其為年長僱員供款以增加銀髮族的退休儲蓄，並在二○二四年《施政報告》提出將有關措施納入促進銀髮經濟工作組的工作內，有關措施的推展進度為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府推行一系列措施，協助求職人士就業。因應中高齡人士的就業需要，政府提供多元化的就業支援，以及推廣長者友善僱傭措施，鼓勵及協助他們重返或留任職場，釋放年長人士的勞動力。

勞工處於去年七月十五日推出為期三年的「再就業津貼試行計劃」，鼓勵連續三個月或以上沒有從事獲酬工作的40歲或以上人士，重投就業市場。每名合資格參加者連續完成12個月工作可獲發最高20,000元再就業津貼。計劃的反應十分理想。截至今年六月已錄得超過45000名參加者及接近23000宗就業個案，其中涉及60歲或以上的參加人數及就業個案數目約佔總數的四分之一。與上述計劃相輔相成，勞工處亦通過「中高齡就業計劃」下的培訓津貼鼓勵僱主聘請40歲或以上人士並提供培訓，讓中高齡人士提升工作技能。

就議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）後，現答覆如下：

（一）在保障本地勞工優先就業的前提下，政府適度容許僱主申請輸入勞工，補充本港勞動力。勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

勞工處推行優化計劃時，致力保障本地勞工優先就業。優化計劃的申請僱主必須進行四星期本地招聘，以不低於當時市場相類職位的每月工資中位數，優先聘請合適的本地工人填補空缺。優化計劃規定，僱主在本地招聘期間經任何途徑招聘本地求職者，均不得提供遜於勞工處同意的聘用條件，亦不可向求職者附加任何年齡、性別等限制性要求。優化計劃亦規定僱主須持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例二比一的規定。同時，僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工，保障本地工人的就業機會。

為進一步加強保障本地工人優先就業，勞工處已於六‍月十七日實施新措施，包括由當日起獲通過初步甄別並進行四星期本地招聘的優化計劃申請，勞工處會在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料時，展示申請公司的名稱，增加本地招聘的透明度，鼓勵求職人士應徵有關職位。

勞工處會檢討優化計劃的經驗與成效，包括計劃的涵蓋範圍、運作和實施安排；促進及確保本地工人（包括年長人士）優先就業的措施；保障輸入勞工權益的措施；以及其他有關計劃的規定及事項。政府在檢討過程中會充分考慮及平衡持份者的意見，從而擬定優化計劃及後的安排。

（二）政府致力消除任何歧視觀念或行為。在就業範疇，政府鼓勵僱主依據「不論年齡，唯才是用」的原則，按照合理和劃一的甄選準則評估應徵者或僱員的工作能力。根據政府統計處曾進行的統計結果顯示，絕大多數受訪者並不認為年齡是影響僱傭方面的重要因素，反映香港就業市場年齡歧視的問題並不顯著。

政府會繼續通過宣傳及推廣平等就業機會的信息，促進和保障平等就業機會，並加強培訓和再培訓，提高不同年齡人士的就業能力。

（三）鼓勵僱主為其65歲或以上的僱員作更多強制性公積金（強積金）自願性供款的稅務優惠建議，目的是鼓勵更多年長僱員在65歲後考慮繼續留在勞動市場，既可為經濟增長作出貢獻，又可增加退休儲蓄。鑑於有意見認為此單一措施的成效不大，建議與其他銀髮措施結合，以產生協同效應，就此，《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出將此項建議納入促進銀髮經濟工作組（工作組）的工作內。工作組經審視後，認為有關建議複雜化了強積金的政策目標，其就有關僱員領取自願性供款所設的限制亦令建議的效用存疑。就鼓勵長者加入勞動市場方面，工作組在今年五月二十七日公布的30項促進銀髮經濟的措施中，已提出多項有助釋放「銀色生產動力」的針對性措施，例如為後50人士推出優先培訓顧問諮詢服務、檢討「再就業津貼試行計劃」及「中高齡就業計劃」，以及加強推廣長者友善僱傭措施，政府認為應集中資源落實上述措施，以更聚焦和直接地促進年長人士就業。"
"LCQ4: Unleashing ""silver productivity""",2025-07-09 12:30,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900300.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Lam Chun-sing and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 In May this year, the Government announced various measures to promote the silver economy. There are views that in terms of unleashing ""silver productivity"", the authorities should introduce more measures to help grass-roots elderly to overcome employment difficulties and improve employment conditions. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as quite a number of grass-roots elderly persons have relayed that under the existing labour importation policies, employers tend to hire younger imported workers, resulting in fewer job opportunities for the elderly, particularly for the job categories covered by the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme, whether the Government will consider tightening such scheme, for example, by setting quota ceilings for all job categories, so as to enhance employment opportunities for the elderly;

(2) as some elderly job seekers have relayed that even if they met the job requirements, some employers explicitly indicated that they refused to hire them due to their advanced age, whether the authorities will actively study the enactment of legislation to combat age discrimination in the workplace; and

(3) given that the Government proposed in 2023 to increase tax deduction for Mandatory Provident Fund voluntary contributions made by employers for their employees aged 65 or above to encourage them to make contributions for mature employees, with a view to increasing the retirement savings of the silver-haired group, and proposed in the 2024 Policy Address to put the relevant measure under the work of the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy, of the progress of taking forward the relevant measure?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been implementing various measures to assist job seekers in securing employment. Taking account of the employment needs of older and middle-aged persons, the Government provides diversified employment support and promote elderly-friendly employment practices to encourage and assist them to re-enter or remain in the employment market, and to unleash the labour force of older persons.

 On July 15 last year, the Labour Department (LD) launched the three-year Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme to encourage persons aged 40 or above who have not been in paid work for three consecutive months or more to re-join the employment market. Each eligible participant who has worked for 12 months continuously will be provided with a re-employment allowance up to $20,000. Response to the Scheme is very favourable. As at June this year, over 45 000 participants and nearly 23 000 placements were recorded. About a quarter of the participants and placements are persons aged 60 or above. In tandem with the above Scheme, the LD, through the training subsidy of the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged, encourages employers to hire persons aged 40 or above and provide them with training to uplift the work skills of older and middle-aged persons.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) On the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government suitably allows employers to apply for importation of workers to replenish the labour force in Hong Kong. The LD has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

 When implementing the ESLS, the LD is committed to safeguarding employment priority for local workers. Applicant employers of the ESLS must undertake a four-week local recruitment exercise and give priority to employing suitable local workers to fill the vacancies at a salary not lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market. The ESLS requires that employers taking on local job seekers through any recruitment channels during the local recruitment period must not offer employment terms less favourable than those agreed by the LD, nor can they impose on job seekers any restrictive requirements such as age or gender. The ESLS also requires employers to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 on a continuous basis. At the same time, employers shall not displace serving local workers with imported workers. To protect the employment opportunities of local workers, employers should retrench imported workers first in the event of redundancy.

 To further strengthen the protection of employment priority for local workers, the LD implemented new measures on June 17, including displaying the names of applicant companies on the Interactive Employment Service website when publishing the job vacancies in respect of the ESLS applications which pass the initial screening and commence the four-week local recruitment process after that date to increase the transparency of local recruitment and encourage job seekers to apply for relevant jobs.

The LD will review the experience and effectiveness of the ESLS, including the Scheme's coverage, operation and implementation arrangements, measures to promote and ensure employment priority for local workers (including older persons), measures to protect the rights and benefits of imported workers, as well as other requirements and matters relating to the ESLS. The Government will take full account of and balance the views of stakeholders during the review when mapping out the future arrangements of the ESLS.

(2) The Government is committed to eliminating all forms of discriminatory ideas and behaviours. In the realm of employment, the Government encourages employers to adopt the principle of ""Count on Talent, Not Age in Employment"" when assessing the abilities of candidates or employees, and use reasonable and standardised selection criteria. According to the results of a survey conducted by the Census and Statistics Department, the vast majority of respondents did not view age as an important factor affecting employment, reflecting that age discrimination is not a major problem in Hong Kong's employment market.

 The Government will continue to promote and uphold equal employment opportunities by disseminating and advocating the message of fairness in employment, as well as strengthening training and retraining to enhance the employability of individuals across all age groups.

(3) The proposed tax initiative to employers to make more Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) voluntary contributions for their employees aged 65 or above aims to encourage more mature employees to consider staying in the labour force and continue to contribute to economic growth after reaching age 65 while increasing their retirement savings. Given that there were views on the limited effect for this standalone measure and recommendations that this measure should be combined with the other initiatives on silver economy for creating synergy, the Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address announced that this proposal would be included in the work of the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy (Working Group). Upon review, the Working Group considered that the proposal has complicated the policy objective of MPF, and the restriction on employees receiving voluntary contributions also casts doubt on the effectiveness of the proposal. In terms of encouraging the elderly to join the labour force, the Working Group has already rolled out various targeted measures to help unleash ""silver productivity"" as part of the 30 measures for promoting silver economy announced on May 27 this year, such as accord priority to post-50s for receiving training consultation service, reviewing the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme and Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged, and stepping up the promotion of elderly-friendly employment practices. The Government considers that resources should be concentrated on the aforementioned measures to promote employment of older persons in a more focused and direct manner."
立法會二十題：提升通關效率,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900358.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳仲尼議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據報本年六月二十一日及二十二日期間，本港各陸路口岸出現嚴重擠塞，香園圍／蓮塘口岸、深圳灣口岸及港珠澳大橋香港口岸須實施人潮管制措施，而六月二十二日晚透過「港珠澳大橋港車北上不設配額計劃」（「港車北上」計劃）出行的港車回港時更造成珠海公路嚴重擠塞。此外，有意見認為「港車北上」計劃部分車輛未有按照預約時段出行，影響口岸的通關效率。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否檢視上述期間陸路口岸嚴重擠塞的主要原因為何（例如是否與中小學考試季節完結、天氣轉好或有深圳商場舉辦活動等因素有關）；政府有否設立跨部門聯合預警機制，結合一般學校的校曆和日程、天氣預報及深圳商業活動資訊，提前評估及預測口岸人流；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）據報上述期間香園圍／蓮塘口岸實施人潮管制及深圳灣口岸出現回港人潮高峰時，當局並無透過官方渠道發布實時提示，政府有否檢討現有的資訊發布機制；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）為避免日後發生上述同類的嚴重擠塞情況，政府會否考慮推行新措施，例如制訂臨時人流管制方案或增加口岸人員配置，以提升通關效率；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）自「港車北上」計劃實施以來，有多少名車主因未按預約時段出行或未有預約而被處罰（按處罰措施（包括拒絕讓車輛前往廣東省、暫停預約出行資格及撤銷獲發的相關牌證）列出）；當局有否檢討現行處罰機制的成效，以及會否考慮調整該機制以進一步確保「港車北上」計劃車輛按時出行？

答覆：

主席：

就陳仲尼議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局後，現回覆如下：

（一）隨着內地與香港合作日益頻繁，民間交流也更見緊密。我們樂見不少港人喜歡在周末或長假期期間到內地旅遊，也喜聞內地訪港旅客人數呈上升趨勢，內地與香港人民的雙向奔赴亦帶動兩地經濟效益。

​今年六月二十一日及二十二日的周末，在各陸路口岸錄得約569 000出境人次（星期六）和約586 000入境人次（星期日），當中約八成為港人，與今年一般周末的平均出境人次及入境人次相比分別多約22%及18%。

港人周末北上已成習慣，加上出行十分便利，亦無須預先計劃行程，市民可因應不同原因，以及視乎當日天氣或個人喜好即興出行。上述周末出入境人數較一般周末為多，估計原因包括可能與學校考試季節完結及周末天氣轉好有關。

出境及入境的繁忙時段分別為星期六上午九時至下午三時，以及星期日下午四時至午夜十二時，與一般周末港人北上的出行習慣相若。至於車流方面，星期六經港珠澳大橋出境的私家車車次為9 662，當中「港車北上」佔68%，而於星期日回港的車次則為9 432，與今年一般周末的出入境車次相比多約25%。

我們留意到港珠澳大橋香港口岸及香園圍管制站在出入境最繁忙的數小時期間，輪候時間較一般長。各口岸相關部門包括入境事務處（入境處）、香港海關、警務處及運輸署等，已備有跨部門合作機制，就不同節日及大型活動，實時監察口岸情況。因應上述周末的口岸繁忙情況，口岸部門已即時啓動應變機制，透過緊密協調，靈活調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱和通道，並採取適當人流管控及交通疏導措施，以維持口岸秩序，讓擠塞情況得以有序疏導。

運輸署一向與本地和跨境公共運輸服務營辦商保持緊密聯繫，並會協調營辦商因應過境高峰期而彈性調整連接各陸路口岸的公共交通服務班次，以應付期間的交通需求。在上述周末，各公共交通營辦商一直密切留意口岸繁忙時段的旅客數量的變化，在乘客需求特別殷切的時段加密班次，並已加派人手協助乘客和維持車站秩序，以加快疏導旅客。

（二）政府已透過不同官方及非官方的渠道，包括電台廣播、網頁及社交平台等線上媒體發布資訊，協助市民及旅客預早計劃行程，盡量避免在繁忙時間過關。其中，市民可瀏覽入境處網頁，查看各邊境管制站的估計輪候過關狀況，以及運輸署的流動應用程式「香港出行易」，或運輸署網頁 （hkemobility.gov.hk/tc/traffic-information/live/cctv），查閱大橋香港口岸出境及入境客車通關廣場的交通快拍。市民亦可以瀏覽深圳和珠海當局相關網頁和小程式等，同時了解內地方的口岸通關狀態。

警方會繼續實時監察各口岸，在個別口岸出現嚴重擠塞的時候，適時透過媒體或社交媒體向市民發布最新信息，包括呼籲市民更改行程（如轉乘其他交通公具或經其他口岸出入境等），以疏導人流車流。

此外，運輸署的緊急事故交通協調中心每日24小時運作，密切監察全港各區，包括各口岸及主要車站的交通情況及公共運輸服務，並透過不同渠道發放最新交通資訊。市民可留意電台、電視台及「香港出行易」發放的最新交通消息。

（三）港人周末北上已成常態，而內地與香港人民的雙向奔赴亦是未來趨勢，因此我們需要作好準備，提升口岸部門的應對能力及口岸通關便利化水平，以應對不斷上升的通關需求。

口岸部門會強化合作機制，時刻監察各管制站的實時情況，與內地口岸部門透過已建立的口岸熱線及即時通報機制保持緊密聯繫，確保口岸運作暢通。

就有關港珠澳大橋香港口岸的交通及車流，警方會因應情況加派警員到口岸主要幹道實地觀察交通情況，提醒駕駛者遵守道路標記、小心駕駛，確保行車安全及道路暢通。當車輛駛至通關廣場並出現飽和情況時，警方亦會適時實施交通管制措施，以維持現場秩序。

此外，為進一步提升香園圍管制站的通關能力，管制站離境大堂正進行優化工程，工程完成後離境大堂的e-道會由原來的14條增加至18條。優化工程期間，離境大堂部分櫃枱需暫停使用，入境處因此靈活調配資源，於離境大堂增設四個臨時櫃枱，務求將優化工程的影響減至最低。我們會研究進一步增加e-道數目。

正如前文所述，內地與香港人民的雙向奔赴是未來趨勢，我們需要提升口岸通關能力，以應對持續增長的旅客流量。其中，特區政府正與深圳市政府全力推進皇崗口岸重建項目。重建後的新皇崗口岸會採用「一地兩檢」安排及「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式，為跨境旅客提供更大便利。新皇崗口岸將設置134條「合作查驗」自助通道及68個傳統人工櫃枱，較現時落馬洲口岸的39條傳統e-道及45個傳統人工櫃枱配置大為提升，其設計通關流量約為每日20萬人次。對比現時每天平均約37 000人次進出的落馬洲口岸，重建後的新皇崗口岸相信可應付兩地未來的通關需求。

（四）「港車北上」的申請條款及條件中列明，如有關參加者違反出行安排（包括沒有事先預約或未有在指定時間內出行），粵港政府相關部門可拒絕讓有關車輛經大橋前往廣東省，並可能暫停其預約出行的資格，甚或撤銷其獲發的相關牌證。現時，運輸署定期把「港車北上」預約出行的資料傳送予口岸部門，以配合部門於大橋香港口岸的日常工作。運輸署亦一直與內地相關部門保持緊密聯繫，不時抽查「港車北上」車輛的過境紀錄以檢視遵守條款及條件的情況。"
立法會二十一題：保障本地勞工就業,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900312.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陸頌雄議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

根據行業輸入勞工計劃及補充勞工優化計劃（「優化計劃」）的一般規定，僱主須符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工的人手比例為二比一（該人手比例），而優化計劃亦規定僱主必須先進行四星期本地招聘，優先聘請合適的本地工人填補空缺。但有工友反映，有僱主利用相關政策漏洞，在向勞工處提交輸入勞工申請後，解僱本地勞工或將他們由全職轉為兼職，更有部分僱主無意招聘本地勞工。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府於上月十八日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，僱主在完成四星期本地招聘程序後，勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人，自優化計劃推出至今，勞工處聯繫不獲聘用的本地工人的次數和相關僱主拒絕聘用他們的理由為何；勞工處以何標準評估僱主拒絕招聘的理由是否合理；

（二）會否主動調查僱主有否向本地求職者提出「過分要求」（即招聘門檻過高及工作量大但薪酬偏低等）；如會，勞工處已進行的調查次數和跟進措施為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）有何機制監察僱主有否嚴格執行四星期本地招聘的規定；會否要求僱主在申請優化計劃前，必須將該等職位空缺資料刊登至勞工處「互動就業服務」網站，並至少保留四星期；

（四）二○二三年至今，勞工處（i）因僱主所提交的資料未符合該人手比例而拒絕輸入勞工申請的宗數，以及（ii）接獲懷疑僱主未有持續遵從該人手比例的投訴宗數、跟進情況和相應罰則分別為何；

（五）二○二三年至今，勞工處以（a）突擊和（b）非突擊方式（i）巡查有輸入勞工的工作場地次數，及（ii）發現並就違反該人手比例規定作出跟進的個案宗數，並以下表列出分項數字；及

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，政府已加強輸入勞工的機制。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）為保障本地勞工優先就業，優化計劃的申請僱主必須先進行四星期本地公開招聘，以不低於市場相類職位的每月工資中位數，優先聘請合資格的本地工人填補空缺。僱主完成本地招聘程序後，勞工處會聯繫每名不獲僱主聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情，並確定僱主匯報不聘用的原因是否與事實相符及合理，從而評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人。最常見不獲聘用的原因為求職者未達入職要求，例如沒有相關工作技能及缺乏相關經驗。視乎情況，勞工處會多次聯繫每名不獲聘用的求職者，跟進面試的結果。

（二）及（三）勞工處嚴謹處理每宗優化計劃的申請，為每個申請職位進行初步甄別，審視職位空缺的聘用條件，包括職責範圍、入職和學歷要求、工作地點、每月薪酬及工作時數等，確保僱主擬提供的薪金達到每月中位工資及招聘條件合理。

通過初步甄別後，僱主須以勞工處同意的招聘條件就申請職位進行四星期本地招聘，其間勞工處會在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料，為有關空缺進行就業選配，並將空缺資料發布給勞工顧問委員會委員、相關職工會及培訓機構，以便他們轉介合適的本地求職人士應徵。僱主須同時在本地報章或其他招聘平台刊登招聘廣告，優化計劃規定，僱主在本地招聘期間經任何途徑招聘本地求職者，均不得提供遜於勞工處同意的聘用條件，亦不可向求職者提出任何年齡、性別等限制性要求或其他未獲勞工處同意的入職要求。

僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果並遞交招聘廣告作核對。勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會中止處理有關申請。勞工處亦會向僱主施加行政制裁，拒絕處理他們在隨後一年提交的其他申請。

（四）優化計劃規定僱主須持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例二比一的規定（人手比例規定）。全職僱員是指僱主直接僱用而每周總工作時數不少於35小時以經營相關業務的本地僱員，不包括兼職僱員、向僱主提供服務的外判商員工或自僱人士。二○二三年九月四日至二○二五年六月，勞工處拒絕29宗涉及未符合人手比例規定的輸入勞工申請。此外，每宗申請獲批的輸入勞工數目亦須符合上述的人手比例。

二○二三年九月四日至二○二五年四月期間，勞工處沒有收到有關僱主不符合人手比例規定的投訴，而二○二五年五月至六月期間則收到31宗這類投訴，勞工處正進行調查，包括巡查輸入勞工的工作地點及查核有關的僱傭紀錄。如證實僱主違反規定，會施加行政制裁，拒絕處理僱主在隨後一年提交的其他申請。

（五）及（六）二○二三年、二○二四年及二○二五年一至五月，勞工處的勞工督察分別到輸入勞工的工作地點及僱主在香港為輸入勞工提供的居所進行5695 次、5417次及2873次巡查，保障輸入勞工的僱傭權益。勞工處不會在巡查工作場所前預先通知有關場所的負責人。

由今年六月十七日起，勞工處實施一系列加強保障本地工人優先就業的新措施，包括在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴；在「互動就業服務」網站刊登優化計劃本地招聘的職位空缺資料時，展示申請公司名稱；進行特別巡查行動，到聘用輸入勞工的企業查核僱主有否持續符合人手比例規定；以及按違規風險，要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例。

為保障本地工人的就業機會，優化計劃規定僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職的本地僱員，並須持續符合人手比例規定。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。如證實僱主違反優化計劃的規定，勞工處會作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准、拒絕處理僱主其後的輸入勞工申請（禁制期最長兩年）等。"

Question:

  According to the general requirements of the sector-specific labour importation schemes and the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS), employers shall fulfil a manning ratio of 2:1 for full-time local employees to imported workers (the manning ratio), and the ESLS also requires applicant employers to undertake a four-week local recruitment exercise and accord priority to employing suitable local workers to fill the job vacancies. However, some workers have reflected that some employers have taken advantage of the loopholes in the relevant policies to dismiss local workers or switch them from full-time to part-time after submitting their labour importation applications to the Labour Department (LD), and some employers even have no intention of recruiting local workers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on 18th of last month, the Government indicated that upon completion of the four-week local recruitment procedures, the LD would contact each of the local job seekers who was not employed by the employers and assess whether the employers are genuinely committed to recruiting local workers, of the number of contacts made by the LD with job seekers who were not employed since the launch of the ESLS, and the reasons for the relevant employers' refusal to employ them; the criteria adopted by the LD for assessing the validity of the employer's reasons for refusal to recruit;

(2) whether it has taken the initiative to investigate if employers have made ""excessive demands"" on local job seekers (i.e. excessively high recruitment thresholds and heavy workload but relatively low salary, etc); if so, of the number of investigations conducted by the LD and the follow-up actions taken; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) of the mechanism in place to monitor whether employers have strictly adhered to the requirement for conducing four-week local recruitment; whether employers will be required to, before applying for the ESLS, publish the job vacancies on the LD's Interactive Employment Service website and retain for at least four weeks;

(4) since 2023, (i) of the number of labour importation applications rejected by the LD due to the failure of the information submitted by the employers to meet the manning ratio; and (ii) of the number of complaints received by the LD regarding employers allegedly failing to continuously meet the manning ratio, the follow-up actions and the corresponding penalties;

(5) since 2023, of the respective numbers of (a) surprise and (b) non-surprise inspections conducted by the LD (i) at workplaces with imported workers, and (ii) cases detected and follow-up actions taken in respect of non-compliance with the manning ratio requirement, with a breakdown as set out in the table below; and

(6) of the measures in place to combat the non-compliant acts under various labour importation schemes in order to prevent abuse of the labour importation policy; whether employers will be required to report to the LD the number, name, working hour, wage and so on of their local employees and imported workers on a monthly basis after their labour importation applications have been approved; if so, of the details; if not, not reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government has enhanced the mechanism for importation of labour. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023, to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

  The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) To safeguard the employment priority for local workers, applicant employers of the ESLS must undertake a four-week local open recruitment and accord priority to employing qualified local workers to fill the vacancies at a salary not lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market. Upon employers' completion of the local recruitment procedures, the LD will contact each of the unsuccessful local job seekers to verify the interview details and confirm if the reasons for not employing the job seekers as reported by the employers are consistent with the facts and reasonable, so as to assess whether the employers have sincerity in recruiting local workers. The most common reason for job seekers not being employed is failing to meet the entry requirements, such as not having relevant work skills and lacking relevant experience. Depending on the circumstances, the LD will contact each unsuccessful job seeker several times to follow up on the interview results.

(2) and (3) The LD stringently processes each application under the ESLS, and conducts initial screening for each applied post and reviews the employment terms, including the scope of duties, entry and academic requirements, work locations, monthly salary and hours of work, to ensure that the salary offered by an employer meets the median monthly wage and the recruitment terms are reasonable.

  After passing the initial screening, employers shall adopt the recruitment terms as agreed by the LD and undergo four-week local recruitment. During this period, the LD will publish the job vacancies on the Interactive Employment Service website, conduct job matching for relevant vacancies and disseminate the vacancy information to members of the Labour Advisory Board, relevant trade unions and training institutions to facilitate their referrals of suitable local job seekers for application. Employers shall in parallel place recruitment advertisements in local newspaper(s) or on other recruitment platform(s). The ESLS requires that employers taking on local job seekers through any recruitment channels during the local recruitment period must not offer employment terms less favourable than those agreed by the LD, nor can they impose on job seekers any restrictive requirements such as age or gender, or other entry requirements not approved by the LD.

  Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results and submit the recruitment advertisements to the LD for verification. The LD will contact each of the local job seekers who is not employed to verify the interview details. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable grounds, the LD will terminate the processing of the relevant application. The LD will also impose administrative sanction on the employer and refuse to process any other application(s) submitted by the concerned employer in the following year.

(4) The ESLS requires relevant employers to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 (manning ratio requirement) on a continuous basis. Full-time employees refer to local employees who are directly employed by an employer and work not less than 35 hours per week for operating the relevant business, excluding part-time staff, staff of subcontractors or self-employed persons providing services to the employer. From September 4, 2023, to June 2025, the LD refused 29 applications for labour importation that failed to meet the manning ratio requirement. In addition, the number of imported workers approved for each application must also comply with the manning ratio mentioned above.

  From September 4, 2023, to April 2025, the LD did not receive any complaint against employers for non-compliance with the manning ratio requirement. As for the 31 related complaints received between May and June 2025, the LD is conducting investigation, including inspecting the workplaces of imported workers and verifying relevant employment records. If violation of the requirement is substantiated, the LD will impose administrative sanction and refuse to process other application(s) submitted by the employer in the following year.

(5) and (6) In 2023, 2024 and from January to May 2025, Labour Inspectors of the LD conducted 5 695, 5 417 and 2 873 inspections respectively to workplaces of imported workers and imported workers' accommodation provided by employers in Hong Kong to protect the employment rights of imported workers. The LD will not give prior notice to the responsible persons of relevant premises before conducting workplace inspections.

  Since June 17 this year, the LD has implemented a series of new measures to strengthen the protection of the employment priority for local workers, including launching an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers for suspected breaches of the requirements of the ESLS, displaying the names of applicant companies when publishing job vacancies on the Interactive Employment Service website, launching a special inspection campaign to check whether establishments employing imported workers have continuously met the manning ratio requirement, and requiring employers to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratios based on a risk-based approach.

  To safeguard the employment priority for local workers, the ESLS requires employers not to displace local workers with imported workers and meet the manning ratio requirement on a continuous basis. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. If there is evidence substantiating violation of the requirement of the ESLS, the LD will impose administrative sanction on the employers, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted and refusal to process other applications submitted by the employers (debarment period up to two years), etc."
LCQ20: Enhancing clearance efficiency,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900357.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Rock Chen and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

It has been reported that serious congestion occurred at various land boundary control points (BCPs) in Hong Kong on June 21 and 22 this year, and crowd management measures had to be implemented at the Heung Yuen Wai/Liantang Control Point, the Shenzhen Bay Port and the Hong Kong Port of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. On the night of June 22, Hong Kong vehicles travelling under the ""Quota-free Scheme for Hong Kong Private Cars Travelling to Guangdong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge"" (""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme) even caused serious congestion on the Zhuhai Highway when they returned to Hong Kong. In addition, there are views that some vehicles under ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme have not travelled according to the reserved time slot, thus affecting the clearance efficiency at BCPs. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has reviewed the main reasons for the serious congestion at land BCPs during the aforesaid period (e.g. whether it was related to factors such as the end of the examination seasons of primary and secondary schools, the improvement of the weather or activities organised by shopping malls in Shenzhen); whether the Government has put in place an inter-departmental joint early warning mechanism which incorporates school calendars and daily schedules of schools in general, weather forecasts as well as information on commercial activities in Shenzhen, so as to make advance assessments and forecasts on the passenger flow at BCPs; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it has been reported that during the aforesaid period when crowd management was implemented at the Heung Yuen Wai/Liantang Control Point and when there were the peak hours for people returning to Hong Kong at the Shenzhen Bay Port, the authorities did not issue real-time alerts through official channels, whether the Government has reviewed the existing information dissemination mechanism; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) in order to avoid the aforesaid similar serious congestion in the future, whether the Government will consider implementing new measures, such as formulating temporary crowd management plans or deploying additional BCP personnel to enhance clearance efficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) of the number of vehicle owners who have been penalised since the implementation of the ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme for failing to travel according to the reserved time slot or failing to make a reservation (set out by penalty measure, including refusing to allow their vehicles to travel to Guangdong Province, suspending their eligibility for making another reservation and revoking the relevant licences issued to them); whether the authorities have reviewed the effectiveness of the existing penalty mechanism, and whether they will consider adjusting the mechanism to further ensure that vehicles under the ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme will travel according to the reserved time slot?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau, a reply to the questions raised by the Hon Rock Chen is as follows:

(1) With the increasing co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong, exchanges at the community level have also intensified. We are pleased to learn that many Hong Kong residents like travelling to the Mainland during weekends or long public holidays, and are glad to learn that the number of Mainland visitors to Hong Kong is on an upward trend. The two-way travel between residents of the Mainland and Hong Kong has also brought economic benefits to both places.

During the weekend of June 21 and 22 this year, around 569 000 outbound passenger trips (Saturday) and around 586 000 inbound passenger trips (Sunday) were recorded at various land boundary control points (BCPs), of which about 80 per cent were Hong Kong residents, representing an increase of about 22 per cent and 18 per cent compared with the average numbers of outbound and inbound passenger trips during normal weekends this year.

Northbound travel has become a weekend routine for Hong Kong residents. Since travelling is very convenient and there is no need for advance planning, residents can make impromptu trips for different reasons, such as weather conditions on the day or individual preference. The reasons for the relatively higher numbers of inbound and outbound passenger trips in the aforementioned weekend as compared with normal weekends may include the end of the school examination season and improved weather conditions during the weekend.

The peak hours for outbound and inbound passenger traffic were from 9am to 3pm on Saturday, and from 4pm to midnight on Sunday, which are similar to the northbound travel pattern of Hong Kong residents at normal weekends. As for the vehicular flow, the number of outbound trips for private cars via the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge (HZMB) on Saturday was 9 662, among which those under the ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme (the Northbound Travel Scheme) accounted for 68 per cent, while the number of inbound trips on Sunday was 9 432, which was about 25 per cent higher than the numbers of outbound and inbound trips at normal weekends this year.

It is noted that the waiting time during the peak hours of cross-boundary traffic at the HZMB Hong Kong Port and Heung Yuen Wai (HYW) BCP was longer than usual. Relevant departments at various BCPs, including the Immigration Department (ImmD), the Customs and Excise Department, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), etc. have put in place an inter-departmental co-operation mechanism to monitor the real-time situations at BCPs during different festive occasions and mega events. In view of the heavy traffic at the BCPs over the aforementioned weekend, relevant departments had immediately activated the contingency mechanism. Through close co-ordination and flexible deployment of manpower, operation of additional clearance counters and kiosks, and implementation of appropriate crowd control and traffic diversion measures to maintain order at the BCPs, congestion was alleviated in an orderly manner.

The TD has always maintained close liaison with local and cross-boundary public transport operators, and would co-ordinate with them to flexibly adjust the frequency of public transport services connecting each BCP during peak cross-boundary travel periods in order to meet the travel needs. During the above-mentioned weekend, public transport operators closely monitored changes in the number of passengers, increased the service frequency during periods of particularly high passenger demand, as well as deployed additional staff to assist passengers and maintain order at the stations, with a view to expediting the dispersal of passengers.

(2) The Government has disseminated information through various official and unofficial channels, including radio broadcasts, websites, and online media such as social media platforms, to assist residents and passengers in planning ahead and avoid making their journeys during busy periods as far as possible. Passengers may visit the ImmD's website to check the estimated waiting time of each BCP, and the TD's ""HKeMobility"" mobile application or the TD's website (hkemobility.gov.hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access the snapshots of traffic conditions at outbound and inbound vehicle clearance plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port. They may also browse the relevant websites and mini programmes, etc. of the Shenzhen and Zhuhai authorities to know more about the clearance status of BCPs in the Mainland.

The HKPF will continue to monitor the real-time situations at various BCPs and disseminate the latest information to the public timely through the media or social media in the event of serious congestion at individual BCP, including appealing to the public to adjust their itineraries (e.g. switching to other modes of transport or using other BCPs for boundary crossing) in order to ease passenger and vehicular flows.

Moreover, the TD's Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre operates 24 hours a day to closely monitor traffic conditions and public transport services in different areas of Hong Kong, including various BCPs and major stations, and will disseminate the latest traffic information through various channels. Members of the public can check the latest traffic news released by radio, television, and the ""HKeMobility"".

(3) Northbound travel over weekends has become a norm for Hong Kong residents, and the two-way travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong is also a future trend. We therefore need to get well-prepared, and enhance the responsiveness of relevant departments as well as the level of clearance facilitation at the BCPs in order to cope with the increasing demand for clearance services.

The departments at the BCPs will enhance the co-operation mechanism, constantly monitor the real-time situations at various BCPs, and maintain close liaison with the Mainland port authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanisms to ensure smooth operation of the BCPs.

With respect to the traffic and vehicular flow at the HZMB Hong Kong Port, the HKPF will, depending on the circumstances, deploy additional police officers to the major roads of the port for on-the-spot observation of traffic conditions, and remind drivers to comply with road markings and drive with care, with a view to ensuring road safety and smooth traffic. When the vehicles enter the clearance plaza and its maximum capacity is reached, the HKPF will also implement traffic control measures in a timely manner to maintain order on the spot.

In addition, to further increase the handling capacity of the HYW BCP, enhancement works are being carried out at its passenger departure hall. Upon completion of the works, the total number of e-Channels in the passenger departure hall will be increased from 14 to 18. As some of its traditional counters have to be closed temporarily in the course of the enhancement works, the ImmD has flexibly deployed resources to set up four temporary counters in the passenger departure hall to minimise the impact of the enhancement works. We will also explore the possibility of further increasing the number of e-Channels.

As stated above, the two-way travel between residents of the Mainland and Hong Kong is a future trend. We need to enhance the handling capacity of BCPs in order to meet the increasing passenger traffic. In particular, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is collaborating with the Shenzhen Municipal Government to press ahead with the redevelopment project of the Huanggang Port in full steam. The redeveloped new Huanggang Port will implement the co-location arrangement and the ""collaborative inspection and joint clearance"" mode to provide greater convenience for cross-boundary passengers. The new Huanggang Port will be equipped with 134 ""collaborative inspection"" automated channels and 68 traditional manual counters, representing a significant increase compared to 39 traditional e-channels and 45 traditional manual counters currently available at the Lok Ma Chau (LMC) Control Point. Its design flow is about 200 000 passenger trips per day. Compared to the LMC Control Point which now serves a daily average of about 37 000 passenger trips, it is believed that the redeveloped new Huanggang Port can meet the future demand for clearance services between the two places.

(4) As stipulated in the terms and conditions of ""the Northbound Travel Scheme"", if any participants violate the travel arrangements (including travelling without booking in advance or not travelling within the specified period), the relevant departments of the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments may refuse to allow relevant vehicles to travel to Guangdong Province via the HZMB, and may suspend their travel booking eligibility, or even revoke the relevant permits. At present, the TD regularly shares the booking information on ""the Northbound Travel Scheme"" with relevant departments at the Hong Kong Port to facilitate their daily operations at the HZMB Hong Kong Port. The TD has also been maintaining close liaison with the relevant Mainland authorities, and conducting spot checks on the cross-boundary records of vehicles under ""the Northbound Travel Scheme"", with a view to reviewing the situation of compliance with the terms and conditions."

問題：

為協助按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）下的業主應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要，香港按證保險有限公司（按證保險公司）於去年八月宣布一項新安排，合資格業主可按個別情況獲豁免按保計劃下的業主自住要求，並獲批准申請將物業出租，惟須符合下述三項條件之一：（i）業主家庭將有新生嬰兒或領養兒童，導致住屋要求改變；（ii）業主失業，因而需要更具彈性的住屋或財務安排；或（iii）業主有其他特別需要出租物業，而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月。此外，申請獲得批准的業主須承諾在豁免生效期間，業主及其同為按保計劃下債務人的配偶或同居伴侶不會在香港購入其他住宅物業。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉按證保險公司分別根據條件（i）、（ii）及（iii）接獲及批准了多少宗豁免業主自住要求的申請；及

（二）會否考慮優化現行安排，進一步協助按保計劃下有意另覓居所的業主，豁免他們在香港購入其他住宅物業的限制，為期最多12個月，讓他們在購入新物業後，有時間處理按保計劃下的物業；如否，原因為何

答覆：

主席：

按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）由香港按證保險有限公司﹙按證保險公司）經營，以協助市民在香港安居置業。按證保險公司於二○二四年八月在按保計劃下設立新安排，按個別情況考慮批准合資格業主將自住的物業出租，以協助他們應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要（新安排）。

就問題的兩個部分，經諮詢按證保險公司後，現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年六月底，按證保險公司就新安排共收到約1 800宗申請。當中共有1 697宗申請獲批，其餘申請為不符合申請條件而被拒絕的個案或正在處理的申請。獲批申請的分類如下：




申請原因
宗數


業主家庭將有新生嬰兒或領養兒童，導致住屋要求改變
336
			（20%）


業主失業，因而需要更具彈性的住屋或財務安排
41
			（2%）


業主有其他特別需要出租物業，而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月
1 320
			（78%）


總數
1 697
			（100%）




（二）由於按保計劃旨在促進市民安居置業，業主自住要求仍然是該計劃的主要合資格準則。新安排屬特殊措施，以協助有特別需要人士。事實上，按保計劃本質上屬保險產品，信貸風險仍是其主要考慮因素之一。如果在按保計劃下允許獲准出租物業的業主在未出售原有物業的情況下購入其他住宅物業，相關業主很可能需要在原有的高成數按揭貸款之外承擔更多融資負債。這將會為按保計劃帶來額外的信貸風險。

新安排推行接近一年，運作暢順，並為有特別需要的業主提供實質協助。按證保險公司暫無計劃調整新安排，未來會不時根據市場情況檢視按保計劃。"
LCQ8: Arrangement for approving property lettings under Mortgage Insurance Programme,2025-07-09 12:15,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070800733.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Louis Loong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 In order to help homeowners under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances, the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMC) announced in August last year a new arrangement, in which a waiver of the owner occupancy requirement under MIP will be granted, on a case-by-case basis, to an eligible homeowner applying for renting out the property subject to the fulfilment of one of the following three conditions: (i) the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s) or adopting child(ren), resulting in a change in housing needs; (ii) the homeowner has become unemployed and requires more flexible housing or financial arrangements; or (iii) the homeowner has other special needs to rent out the property, and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months. In addition, homeowners whose applications are approved will be subject to undertakings that so long as the waiver is in effect, they or their spouses or cohabitants who are also obligors under the MIP should not purchase any additional residential properties in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the respective numbers of applications received and approved for waiver of the owner occupancy requirement by HKMC on the basis of the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii); and

(2) whether consideration will be given to the enhancement of the existing arrangement to provide further assistance to homeowners under MIP who wish to seek alternative accommodation by waiving their restriction on purchasing additional residential properties in Hong Kong for a period of up to 12 months, so as to give them a window of time to dispose of their properties under MIP upon acquisition of new properties; if not, of the reason for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement).

 After consulting the HKMCI, our reply to the two parts of the question is as follows:

(1) As of end-June 2025, the HKMCI has received about 1 800 applications for the new arrangement. Among them, 1 697 applications were approved, while the remaining applications were either rejected for not meeting the eligibility requirements or are under processing. The breakdowns of the applications approved are as follows:




Reason for application
Number


The homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s) or
			adopting child(ren), resulting in a change in housing needs
336
			(20%)


The homeowner has become unemployed and requires more
			flexible housing or financial arrangements
41
			(2%)


The homeowner has other special needs to rent out his/her property, and has been residing in the relevant property for
			not less than 12 months
1 320
			(78%)


Total
1 697
			(100%)




(2) As the aim of the MIP is to promote home ownership, the owner occupancy requirement remains a key eligibility criterion of the MIP. The new arrangement is an exceptional measure that seeks to assist those with special needs. In fact, the MIP by nature is an insurance product, with credit risk being one of the key factors of consideration. If homeowners who have been given consent to rent out their properties under the MIP are allowed to purchase additional residential properties without having sold their existing ones, it is likely for the respective homeowners to take on extra financing liabilities on top of their current high loan-to-value ratio mortgage loans. This will bring additional credit risk to the MIP.

 The new arrangement has been launched for around one year and operating smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. The HKMCI has no plan to make changes to the new arrangement at the moment, and will keep the MIP under review from time to time in the light of the market circumstances."
立法會十四題：海洋公園登山纜車,2025-07-09 12:00,2025-07-09 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900337.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上田北辰議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

根據海洋公園公司的資料，二○二三至二四年度海洋公園的總入場人次多達314萬，而據悉園內可讓搭乘遊客欣賞沿途景色的登山纜車極受歡迎。然而，本人近日收到不少市民反映，雖然該園設有兩組來回、合共四線的登山纜車，但園方在大部分周末及公眾假期僅開放其中一組共兩線供遊客使用，導致輪候纜車時間最少半個小時，大大影響遊客的體驗及對香港觀感。本人得悉纜車操作員需具備高空拯救技能及考取牌照，園方因人力資源所限，以致未能在全年所有周末及公眾假期（約120天）全面開放四線登山纜車服務。就此，政府可否告知本會，是否知悉：

（一）園方有否評估在全年所有周末及公眾假期（共約120天），開放所有登山纜車線服務所需的額外人手為何；及

（二）園方會否考慮從內地或其他地區招聘具經驗的纜車操作員，以應付日益增加的遊客需求；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

海洋公園（公園）的登山纜車是公園的標誌性設施，多年來為訪客提供獨特的遊樂體驗。現時公園共設兩組纜車，每組包括登山和下山路線各一，車程每程約13分鐘，每組每小時最多接載4 000名訪客。除登山纜車外，在二○○九年九月投入服務的海洋列車（列車）亦為訪客提供登山和下山的另一選擇。列車車程每程約四分鐘，每小時可運載高達一萬名訪客。由於列車能同時接載更多訪客，而每程時間亦較短，可為訪客提供更快捷往返兩個園區的服務，因此列車現時是往返公園山下及山上園區的主要交通工具。登山纜車則已逐漸成為園內的景點體驗設施，是公園最受歡迎的遊樂體驗設施之一。

就田北辰議員的提問，經諮詢公園，現回覆如下：

公園一直根據《架空纜車（安全）條例》（第211章）操作及保養纜車，以確保纜車服務的安全及可靠程度達至法例要求。除了每天進行例行機件檢查及運作測試，纜車系統須經多項定期檢查及預防性維修保養，例如纜塔頂滑輪組維修、車廂及後備發電機組檢查及保養等，方可運載乘客。為了確保纜車系統安全運作，纜車操作員及纜車控制員須持有由政府機電工程署發出的相關牌照，以確保他們具備所需的技能、專業知識和資歷。有意於公園考取纜車操作員牌照的人士須於訓練期間，在持牌控制員及操作員的指導下接受纜車系統日常運作、救援、維修保養、於纜車塔頂工作等一系列的訓練，並累積最少一年的在職經驗，才符合資格考取相關牌照，考獲牌照後仍須在纜車控制員的監督下方可操作纜車。而有意於公園考取纜車控制員牌照的人士則須先取得纜車操作員牌照，並在其後累積最少一年的實際經驗，同時具備執行大型部件更換和快速故障處理的能力，才符合資格考取相關牌照。

公園的纜車團隊現時共有七名纜車操作員及九名纜車控制員。在二○二四／二五財政年度（註），公園為訪客提供342日纜車服務，當中56日提供兩組纜車服務，其餘日子則提供一組纜車服務。公園現時另有九名在職員工正接受培訓和考取專業資格。倘若公園全年無間斷營運纜車，並於所有週末及公眾假期共約120日提供兩組纜車服務（天氣不許可或更換纜索等大型工程除外），公園需額外物色及增聘16名合適的新員工，讓他們接受培訓，以及累積所須的在職經驗後考取相關牌照。

為了向訪客提供優質的遊樂體驗，在纜車操作方面，公園一直積極透過內部培訓及對外招募增加人手。除了刊登網上招聘廣告，公園亦定期舉辦招聘日，為有意加入的應徵者提供即場面試，並向獲取錄的員工提供入職獎金、高空工作律貼、救援津貼、生日假期、工作周年假期等福利，務求招募更多合適人手投入相關工作。然而，纜車操作及維修的工作性質比較專門，而過去員工流失率亦高，公園已察悉難在本地勞工市場招聘有意入行的合適入才。有見及此，除了繼續積極於本地進行招聘工作外，公園自二○二四年九月起透過勞工處的「補充勞工優化計劃」，從內地招聘具三年以上纜車相關經驗的技術人員。上述九位現時正接受公園纜車系統培訓和考取專業資格的在職員工中，四位是透過計劃從內地招募的技術人員。

公園一直按恰當運用資源的原則，考慮不同因素，包括當天是平日或假期、天氣情況、園內推廣活動、特備節目地點及時間等，以安排每天的纜車服務應付預測的入場人數。

註：公園的財政年度由每年的七月一日至來年的六月三十日。在二○二四／二五財政年度，因休園日公園共12日沒有開放。另外，由於需要進行纜車維修保養及受颱風影響，該年度公園另有11日並沒有提供纜車服務。"
LCQ14: Ocean Park Cable Car,2025-07-09 12:00,2025-07-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900349.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Michael Tien and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

According to information from the Ocean Park Corporation, the total visitor numbers of Ocean Park (OP) in 2023-24 reached 3.14 million. It is learnt that the Cable Car is an immensely popular attraction that offers visitors the opportunity to relish scenic views during their journey. However, quite a number of members of the public have recently relayed to me that while the OP Cable Car is a two-lane ropeway system comprising two sets of round-trip cable cars with a total of four lanes, the OP only operates one set of two-lane ropeway for visitors on most weekends and public holidays, and as a result the waiting time for cable cars is at least half an hour, which has significantly undermined visitors' experience and their image of Hong Kong. I have learnt that as cable car operators are required to have high-angle rescue skills and obtain a licence, the OP is unable to put all four cable car lanes into full operation on all weekends and public holidays throughout the year (approximately 120 days) due to limited manpower resources. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council whether it knows:

(1) whether the OP has assessed the additional manpower required to operate all the cable car lanes on all weekends and public holidays throughout the year (approximately a total of 120 days); and

(2) whether the OP will consider recruiting experienced cable car operators from the Mainland or other regions to cope with the growing visitor demand; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Cable Car at Ocean Park (OP) is an iconic attraction of the OP. For many years, it has been providing visitors with a unique recreational experience. The OP has two sets of cable car ropeways, each comprising an ascent route and a descent route. Each one-way ride takes about 13 minutes and each set of ropeway is capable of transporting up to 4 000 visitors per hour. Apart from the Cable Car, the Ocean Express (OE), a train launched in September 2009, provides an alternative means for travelling between the lower and upper parks of the OP, carrying up to 10 000 passengers per hour and taking about 4 minutes for each one-way ride. As the OE has a higher passenger capacity and shorter travel time, it has become the primary mode of transportation offering quicker travelling for visitors between the OP's lower and upper parks. On the other hand, the Cable Car has gradually turned into an attraction to enrich visitor experience and is one of the most popular facilities of the OP.

In consultation with the OP, the reply to the question raised by the Hon Michael Tien is as follows:

The OP has been operating and maintaining the cable cars in accordance with the Aerial Ropeways (Safety) Ordinance (Cap 211) to ensure the safety and reliability of the cable car service in compliance with the statutory requirements. In addition to daily routine mechanical inspections and operational testing, the cable car system has to undergo a number of regular inspections and preventive maintenance (e.g. sheave maintenance at the top of the cable car trestles, inspection and maintenance of the cabins and back-up power generator, etc.) before it is deemed suitable for passenger service. To ensure safe operation of the cable car system, cable car operators and controllers are required to hold relevant licences issued by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department to ensure that they possess the necessary skills, professional knowledge and qualifications. Prospective cable car operators who wish to apply for the relevant licence at the OP have to undergo a series of training on the cable car system's daily operation, rescue, repair and maintenance, work on cable car trestles under the guidance of licensed controllers and operators during the training period, and accumulate at least one year of on-the-job experience, in order to be eligible for applying the licence. After obtaining the licence, they can only operate the cable car under the supervision of a cable car controller. Those who intend to obtain a cable car controller licence at the OP have to first acquire a cable car operator licence, accumulate at least one year of practical experience thereafter, and demonstrate the ability to perform large-scale component replacement and rapid fault handling before they are qualified to apply for the relevant licence.

The OP's cable car team currently consists of seven operators and nine controllers. In its 2024/25 financial year (Note), the OP provided visitors with 342 days of cable car service, including dual-ropeway service for 56 days and single-ropeway service for the remaining days. Currently, nine existing staff members of the OP are undergoing training and obtaining professional qualifications. If the OP were to operate the cable car continuously throughout the year and provide dual-ropeway cable car service on all weekends and public holidays for a total of about 120 days (except for extreme weather or major works such as cable replacement, etc.), the OP would need to identify and recruit an additional 16 new staff members to undergo training and accumulate the necessary on-the-job experience for applying for the relevant licences.

To provide visitors with quality recreational experience, the OP has been actively seeking to increase the manpower of its cable car operations through internal training as well as external recruitment. Apart from online job advertisement, the OP organises recruitment days on a regular basis and offers on-site interview opportunities for prospective candidates. Successful candidates are provided with benefits such as new joiner bonus, work-at-height allowance, rescue allowance, birthday leave, anniversary leave, etc, in order to recruit more suitable candidates to join the relevant job. However, as the job nature of cable car operations and maintenance are relatively specialised and the turnover rate is high, the OP finds it challenging to recruit suitable candidates from the local labour market. In light of this, apart from the continuing active local recruitment, the OP has been recruiting technical staff with at least three years of cable car-related experience from the Mainland since September 2024 under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme of the Labour Department. Of the nine existing staff members who are currently receiving training and acquiring professional qualifications, four were recruited from the Mainland through the Scheme.

As a practice, in determining the cable car service to be provided to cater for the projected number of visitors each day, the OP will abide by the principle of proper utilisation of resources and take into account various factors, including whether the day is a weekday or a holiday, weather conditions, in-park promotional activities, and the location and schedule of special events, etc.

Note: The OP's financial year (FY) starts on every July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. In FY 2024/25, the park was closed for 12 days due to its dark day arrangement. And, owing to cable car maintenance and typhoon, the cable car service was suspended for another 11 days."

答覆：

主席：

勞工處推行「中高齡就業計劃」，鼓勵僱主聘請40歲或以上人士並提供在職培訓。僱主聘用每名60歲或以上失業或已離開職場的求職人士，並為他們提供在職培訓，可獲發每月最高5,000元的在職培訓津貼，為期六至12個月；而聘用每名40歲至59歲失業求職人士的最高在職培訓津貼金額則為每月4,000元，為期三至六個月。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二四年，「中高齡就業計劃」每年分別錄得2260宗、3340宗、2707宗、3873宗及4443宗合資格就業個案，涉及937名、1266名、1169名、1420名及1559名僱主。

（二）及（三）勞工處致力提供多元化的就業服務，促進中高齡人士就業。勞工處的十所就業中心為中高齡人士提供就業支援及專項服務，包括優先就業轉介服務和就業講座。中心的就業主任亦為他們提供個人化的就業諮詢、求職配對服務，以及培訓／再培訓課程的資料。此外，勞工處「互動就業服務」網站已設立「年長求職人士專頁」、「兼職職位專頁」，方便中高齡人士獲取最新就業資訊和尋找合適空缺。

為配合政府「促進銀髮經濟工作組」釋放「銀色生產動力」的目標，勞工處二○二五年將會舉辦約60場適合中高齡人士的大型或地區性專題招聘會，較去年的場次增加一倍。中高齡求職人士在招聘會可即場申請職位及面試，加快求職過程。

勞工處二○二四年七月十五日推出為期三年的「再就業津貼試行計劃」（再就業計劃），鼓勵連續三個月或以上沒有從事任何獲酬工作的40歲或以上人士投入就業市場。截至二○二五年六月，再就業計劃已錄得超過45000名參加者及接近23000宗就業個案，遠超原定在推行計劃三年期間可惠及6 000名就業人士的目標。其中，涉及60歲或以上的參加人數及就業個案數目約佔總數的四分之一。勞工處歡迎聘請再就業計劃參加者的僱主同時參加「中高齡就業計劃」。

勞工處將於二○二六年第一季就再就業計劃進行中期檢討，配合「中高齡就業計劃」，探討進一步促進中高齡人士就業的措施。

由於就業個案的數目受經濟、勞工市場及求職人士個人情況等因素影響，為勞動人口參與率制定關鍵績效指標並不合適。

（四）政府一直鼓勵僱主「不論年齡、唯才是用」，並按企業的情況採納長者友善僱傭措施，例如延長僱員的工作年齡、提供靈活的工作安排，以及締造適合長者工作的環境等，讓更多年長人士繼續或再就業。

勞工處會繼續進行宣傳推廣，並推行就業計劃，鼓勵僱主聘用中高齡人士。由於企業聘用員工的考慮及情況不同，政府目前沒有計劃以立法方式規管企業僱用長者員工。"

Question:

 To support the employment of elderly persons, the Labour Department has implemented the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged (EPEM) to provide employers with on-the-job training allowance to encourage them to engage unemployed job seekers aged 40 or above. On supporting the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of employers involved in the placements eligible for joining the EPEM in the past five years;

(2) whether it will formulate performance indicators for the EPEM, such as setting separate targets for the participation rates of persons aged 40 to 59, 60 to 64 and 65 or above in the total labour force, and review in a timely manner the effectiveness of the EPEM in promoting the employment of elderly and middle-aged job seekers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether it will allocate additional resources to enhance the existing measures to support the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons and provide targeted employment support, including organising different types of thematic job fairs (e.g. job fairs on part-time jobs specially designed for elderly and middle-aged persons), enhancing employment training for elderly persons, as well as providing personalised employment counselling and job-matching services, thereby assisting elderly and middle-aged persons in re-‍entering the workforce in a holistic manner; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) whether it will consider drawing reference from the practices of neighbouring countries and formulating, by way of legislation, guidelines for employers on the re-employment of elderly persons, as well as designing suitable job types and setting remuneration according to the abilities of elderly persons, thereby regulating the responsibility of enterprises in employing elderly staff; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Labour Department (LD) implements the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged (EPEM) to encourage employers to hire persons aged 40 or above, and provide them with on-the-job training (OJT). Employers engaging job seekers aged 60 or above who are unemployed or have left the workforce and providing them with OJT will receive a maximum OJT allowance of $5,000 per month per employee for six to 12 months; while engaging unemployed job seekers aged 40 to 59 will receive a maximum OJT allowance of $4,000 per month per employee for three to six months.

 In response to the Member's question, the reply is provided as follows:

(1) From 2020 to 2024, the EPEM recorded respectively 2260, 3340, 2707, 3873 and 4443 eligible placements in each year, involving 937, 1266, 1169, 1420 and 1559 employers.

(2) and (3) The LD is committed to providing diversified employment services to promote the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons. The ten job centres of the LD provides elderly and middle-aged persons with employment support and dedicated services, including priority job referral service, employment briefings. Employment officers of the centres also provide personalised employment advisory and job matching services, as well as information on training/re-training courses to them. Moreover, the LD has set up the Dedicated Webpage for Elderly Job Seekers and the Dedicated Webpage on Part-time Jobs on the Interactive Employment Service website, so as to facilitate elderly and middle-aged persons to obtain the latest employment information and search for suitable vacancies.

 To tie in with the target of unleashing ""silver productivity"" put forth by the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy, the LD will stage about 60 large-scale or district-based thematic job fairs suitable for elderly and middle-aged persons in 2025, doubling the number of fairs compared to last year. Elderly and middle-aged job seekers can submit job applications and attend interviews on the spot to expedite the job seeking process.

 The LD launched the three-year Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme (REA Scheme) on July 15, 2024 to encourage persons aged 40 or above, who have not been in paid work for three consecutive months or more, to join the employment market. As at June 2025, over 45000 participants and nearly 23000 placements were recorded, far exceeding the original target of benefiting 6000 employed persons during the three-year implementation period. Of which, about one quarter of the participants and placements involved persons aged 60 or above. The LD welcomes employers taking on the participants of the REA Scheme to join the EPEM.

 The LD will conduct a mid-term review on the REA Scheme in the first quarter of 2026, along with the EPEM, to explore further measures to encourage the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons.

 As the number of placements may be affected by various factors such as the economy, labour market situation and the personal circumstances of job seekers, it is inappropriate to set key performance indicators for the labour force participation rate.

(4) The Government has been encouraging employers to follow the principle of ""Count on Talent, Not Age in Employment"" and, having regard to the individual circumstances of their enterprises, to adopt elderly-friendly employment practices such as extending the working life of employees, providing flexible work arrangements, fostering an environment conducive to elderly employment, so as to facilitate more older persons to stay in or rejoin the labour market.

 The LD will continue to conduct publicity and promotional activities as well as implement employment programmes to encourage employers to hire elderly and middle-aged persons. Owing to the varied considerations and circumstances of enterprises in recruiting staff, the Government currently has no plan to regulate the employment of older employees through legislation."
立法會十五題：國際調解院,2025-07-09 11:45,2025-07-09 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900342.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上林健鋒議員的提問和署理律政司司長張國鈞博士的書面答覆：

問題：

在國家的支持下，國際調解院的總部正式落戶香港，並預計於本年年底或明年年初投入運作。此外，33個國家於本年五月三十日簽署《關於建立國際調解院的公約》。有意見認為由於國際調解院是首個把總部設在香港的政府間國際組織，將進一步加強香港作為「亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心」的定位。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否估算國際調解院將為香港帶來的效益，或訂立成效指標（例如新增調解員、翻譯員和研究員等崗位的數量，以及新進駐的國際組織、非政府機構和學術機構的數量）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否考慮作出相關估算和訂立成效指標；

（二）是否知悉國際調解院有否已制訂調解員的具體選拔條件，以及相關指引和審查機制，以保證調解員可提供具合理專業水平的調解服務；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及何時完成制訂；及

（三）據報所有國家，不限於簽約國，均能使用國際調解院的服務，但有意見認為由於法律具有高度區域性（即不同司法管轄區使用不同法律體系和制度），爭議雙方對法理的理解不同，令他們期望調解服務可達致的成果可能大相徑庭，國際調解院總部會否訂立協調政策，以保障其調解服務可達致來自不同司法管轄區的爭議方均感到滿意的合理水平？

答覆：

主席︰

就林健鋒議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（三）國際調解院落戶香港，有助吸引世界各地人士來港以調解及其他方式解決爭議，加強香港作為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。國際調解院落戶香港更可吸引更多國際組織、非政府組織和學術機構進駐，進一步鞏固香港的國際地位和知名度。預期為香港帶來正面的經濟效益。國際調解院的落戶會為香港創造更多就業機會，如調解員、翻譯員、研究員和行政人員等，並吸引國際法律專業人士和學者來港，有助推動法律實務、研究和國際司法合作的發展，加強香港的國際法律網絡。座落在灣仔的國際調解院總部，將不但促進香港的國際法律和爭議解決服務發展，而且吸引更多國際會議和展覽等相關活動在香港舉行，繼而促進酒店、餐飲和運輸物流等其他行業的發展。

國際調解院要待《關於建立國際調解院的公約》通過、簽署和生效後才會正式成立，而其總部才得以正式落戶香港特區。國際調解院尚未開始運作，現階段未能提供具體詳情。正如其他政府間國際組織，國際調解院將會是獨立的國際組織，其運作政策和決定（包是否或如何訂立成效指標或協調政策），會由國際調解院自行安排和訂立。

（二）《關於建立國際調解院的公約》第四章（第十九至二十三條）規定了國際調解院的調解員名單的具體事宜，包括調解員的指派，調解員的資質和任期等。《公約》條文請見www.international-mediation.org/basic-documents。"
LCQ15: International Organization for Mediation,2025-07-09 11:45,2025-07-09 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900351.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Jeffrey Lam and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

With the support of our country, the headquarters of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) has been formally established in Hong Kong and is expected to come into operation by the end of this year or early next year. In addition, 33 countries signed the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (the Convention) on May 30 this year. There are views that as IOMed is the first international inter-governmental organisation setting up its headquarters in Hong Kong, the position of Hong Kong as ""the leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific Region"" will further be strengthened. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has estimated the benefits to be brought to Hong Kong by IOMed or set the relevant performance indicators (e.g. the numbers of additional positions, such as mediators, translators and researchers, etc, to be created, as well as the numbers of international organisations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions which will establish a new presence in Hong Kong); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will consider making the relevant estimations and setting performance indicators;

(2) whether it knows if IOMed has formulated the specific selection criteria for mediators, as well as the relevant guidelines and review mechanism, so as to ensure that mediators are able to provide mediation services at a reasonable professional standard; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and when such formulation will be completed; and

(3) while it has been reported that all countries, not limited to the signatories of the Convention, have access to the services of IOMed, there are views that given the nature of the law which is highly specific to a particular region (i.e. different jurisdictions have different legal systems and regimes), the outcome which can be achieved through mediation services may significantly fall short of expectation of the parties to a dispute since legal concepts may subject to different interpretations by different parties, whether the headquarters of IOMed will formulate co-ordination policies to ensure that its mediation services will bring a reasonable level of satisfaction to the parties to disputes from different jurisdictions?

Reply:

President,

In response to the enquiry raised by the Hon Jeffrey Lam, the consolidated reply is as follows:

(1) and (3)The establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong will assist in attracting people from all over the world to come to Hong Kong to resolve disputes through mediation and other means, strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre. IOMed also attracts more international organisations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions to settle in Hong Kong, which further consolidate Hong Kong's international status and reputation. It is expected to bring positive economic benefits to Hong Kong. The establishment of IOMed will create more employment opportunities for Hong Kong, such as mediators, translators, researchers and administrative staff. This also attracts international legal professionals and scholars to Hong Kong, which will help promoting the development of legal practice, research and international judicial co-operation, and strengthening Hong Kong's international legal network. The IOMed headquarters being located in Wan Chai will not only promote the development of Hong Kong's international legal and dispute resolution services, but also attract more international conferences and exhibitions and other related activities to be held in Hong Kong, thereby promoting the development of other sectors such as hotels, catering and transportation logistics.

âIOMed will be officially established with its headquarters to be formally set up in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region following the adoption, signing and entry into force of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation. IOMed has not yet commenced its operation and hence no further details may be provided at the present stage. Same as other international inter-governmental organisations, IOMed will be an independent international organisation, which will make its own policy and decision for its operation (including whether and how to set any key performance indicator or any co-ordination policy).

(2)Chapter IV (Articles 19 to 23) of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation governs the Panel of Mediators of IOMed, including designation of mediators, qualifications of mediators and their term of office. Please see www.international-mediation.org/basic-documentsfor the Articles under the Convention."

問題：

據報每逢啟德體育園（體育園）舉辦演唱會和大型賽事，不少私家車違法停泊在體育園周邊區域的道路，造成交通嚴重堵塞，並對其他道路使用者構成危險。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）警方在體育園周邊區域針對涉及違法駕駛者所採取的執法行動為何，以及有否評估該等行動的成效；

（二）鑑於體育園在舉辦演唱會和賽事期間會暫停開放私家車泊車位及上落客位，政府會否考慮調整有關安排，在大型活動期間開放該園的私家車泊車位及上落客位予公眾使用；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）有否研究在體育園鄰近地方興建多層停車場，以解決該區域泊車位不足問題；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就楊永杰議員關於啟德體育園周邊泊車安排的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局、警務處及運輸署，我現綜合回覆如下：

（一）警務處一直密切監察啟德體育園周邊道路在舉行大型活動期間的交通情況。如果發現有司機違例泊車，造成交通嚴重阻塞，或對其他道路使用者構成危險，警務處除了會對有關人士和車輛採取執法行動外，亦會按情況在不予警告下即時把車輛拖走。

自啟德體育園由本年三月開幕至六月中旬期間，園區曾舉辦七項大型活動，活動總日數為十九日。期間，警務處共發出190張定額罰款通知書及拖走15輛違例車輛。

警務處將繼續根據「重點交通執法項目」打擊交通違例行為，確保道路暢順及保障道路使用者安全。


（二）及（三）目前，啟德體育園區共提供約600個私家車泊車位供日常前往園區的駕駛者使用。在大型活動舉行期間，考慮到園區附近一帶的交通較為繁忙，為配合人流及交通管理，政府一直呼籲前往園區的觀眾乘搭公共交通工具，避免駕駛或乘坐私家車。因應活動的規模，運輸署會協調公共交通營辦商調整公共交通服務，在相關時段加密港鐵屯馬綫的班次、按需要加強巴士服務或安排特別巴士路線等，配合活動進行期間額外的交通需求。

運輸署亦就園區交通事宜與文化體育及旅遊局、其他相關部門及啟德體育園有限公司保持緊密溝通，商討進一步優化安排。在汲取各個大型活動的經驗和私家車使用者的意見後，為提供更佳便利，園區已於今年六月起在大型活動期間開放啟德主場館的士上落客區供的士上落客之用，亦增設啟德體藝館泊車位預約服務。有需要的駕駛者可預先購買啟德體藝館停車場泊車證和提前預約，以在大型活動期間使用部分泊車位。此外，園區附近亦有其他泊車地點，例如距離約10至15分鐘步程的兩個購物商場共提供約1 300個私家車泊位。駕駛者可透過運輸署的「香港出行易」程式，查閱園區及上述兩個商場泊車設施的可用車位實時資訊。

如上所述，啟德體育園區及鄰近商場共提供約1 900個私家車泊位。運輸署會與啟德體育園有限公司緊密聯繫，善用現有泊車設施並持續優化園區的泊車安排。運輸署亦會持續監察區內整體泊車需求，並與相關部門適時檢討，確保交通配套與區域發展相配合。"

Question:

It is reported that whenever concerts and major games are held at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), many private cars are illegally parked on roads around KTSP, causing severe traffic congestion and posing dangers to other road users. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the enforcement actions taken by the Police against persons involved in driving offences in areas surrounding KTSP, and whether the effectiveness of such actions has been assessed;

(2) given that private car parking spaces and pick-up/drop-off areas at KTSP are temporarily closed when concerts and games are held there, whether the Government will consider adjusting such arrangements to allow public access to private car parking spaces and pick-up/drop-off areas at KTSP during major events; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it has conducted studies on constructing a multi-storey car park in the vicinity of KTSP to address the shortage of parking spaces in the area; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

After consulting the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), my consolidated response to the questions raised by the Hon Yang Wing-kit regarding the parking arrangements around the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is as follows:

(1) The HKPF has always been closely monitoring the road traffic conditions around the KTSP during major events. When illegal parking activities causing severe traffic congestion or endangering other road users are spotted, the HKPF will take enforcement action against the motorists and vehicles involved and, where appropriate, tow the vehicles away without prior warning.

Since the commissioning of the KTSP in March up to mid-June this year, the venue has hosted seven major events spanning 19 days, during when the HKPF issued a total of 190 fixed penalty notices and towed away 15 illegally parked vehicles.

The HKPF will continue to combat traffic offences in accordance with the Selected Traffic Enforcement Priorities to ensure smooth traffic flow and protect the safety of road users.

(2) and (3) At present, the KTSP provides about 600 private cars (PC) parking spaces for the daily use of motorists. During major events, in view of heavier traffic in KTSP's vicinity and in order to facilitate crowd and traffic management, the Government always encourages visitors to use public transport, avoid driving or taking PCs. Having regard to the scale of the event, the TD will co-ordinate with public transport operators to adjust public transport services, enhancing the interval between trains of the MTR Tuen Ma Line during such occasions, enhacing bus services or arranging special bus services as needed to meet the additional traffic demand during the event period.

The TD also maintains close communication with the CSTB, other relevant departments, and Kai Tak Sports Park Limited regarding traffic issues around the KTSP, and discusses further enhancements to traffic arrangements. Drawing on the experience of various large-scale events and feedback from PC users, the KTSP has, since June this year, opened the taxi pick-up/drop-off area at Kai Tak Stadium for taxi use and introduced a parking space booking service for PC users at Kai Tak Arena to enhance convenience. Motorists with parking needs may purchase parking voucher in advance to reserve parking spaces at the Kai Tak Arena car park during major events. In addition, there are other parking spaces available near the KTSP, including two shopping malls within a 10 to 15-minute walk that collectively offer about 1 300 PC parking spaces. Motorists may check real-time parking vacancy information of car parks at the KTSP and the above two shopping malls via TD's ""HKeMobility"" mobile application.

As mentioned above, the KTSP and the nearby shopping malls together offer a total of about 1 900 PC parking spaces. The TD will maintain close liaison with Kai Tak Sports Park Limited for making optimal use of the exitsing parking facilities and continuing to enhance the parking arranagements in the KTSP. The TD will also continue to monitor the overall parking demand in the district, and conduct timely review with relevant departments to ensure the transport facilities keep pace with the district development."
Government invites tenders for short-term tenancy in Ma On Shan for fee-paying public car park with installation of automated parking system,2025-07-09 11:00,2025-07-09 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900264.htm,"  The Government today (July 9) invites tenders for a short-term tenancy (STT) of one lot of government land at Po Tai Street in Ma On Shan (STT No. STTST0065) to be used for a fee-paying public car park, with the installation of an automated parking system (APS) as the sixth APS project at a government STT site so far. The tenancy is for a fixed term of seven years and renewable thereafter on a half-yearly basis.

  A spokesman for the Transport Department said that the application of APS can utilise space more effectively and increase parking efficiency, alleviating the public demand for parking spaces. The Government is actively taking forward APS projects in suitable STT car parks. The first three APS projects at Hoi Shing Road in Tsuen Wan, Pak Shek Kok in Tai Po and Tung Chau Street in Sham Shui Po have already commenced services, providing about 180 automated parking spaces in total. The APS project at the STT car park at Hoi Wang Road in Yau Ma Tei is expected to be commissioned this year. In addition, APS will also be installed at the STT car park at Lok Wah Street in Tsz Wan Shan and the above project at Po Tai Street in Ma On Shan, and tendering is under way.

  Regarding the tender for the Ma On Shan project, under the tenancy agreement, the successful tenderer is required to erect, construct and install an APS at the site within 15 months from the commencement date of the tenancy, providing not less than 104 automated parking spaces out of a total minimum of 247 parking spaces.

  The Tender Document can be obtained from the Lands Department website (www.landsd.gov.hk) or the following offices:

1. The Survey and Mapping Office, Lands Department, 6/F, North Point Government Offices, 333 Java Road, North Point; and

  Prospective tenderers must pay attention to all the requirements set out in the tender notice and the tenancy agreement of the tender document.

  Tenders must be deposited in the Public Works Tender Box situated at Room 503, 5/F, Low Block, Queensway Government Offices, 66 Queensway, Hong Kong, before noon on August 22 (Friday). Late tenders will not be accepted."

Speech by FS at Hong Kong - Korea Capital Markets Conference (English only) (with photos/video),2025-07-09 10:52,2025-07-09 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900263.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong – Korea Capital Markets Conference held in Seoul, Korea today (July 9):

Mr Seo (Chairman of the Korea Financial Investment Association, Mr Seo Yoo-seok), Greg (Managing Director and Head of Markets, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Mr Gregory Yu), Ms Ding Chen (Chief Executive Officer of CSOP Asset Management Limited), ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo. Good morning.

It is a great honour and pleasure to be here with you today in Seoul. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to CSOP Asset Management and all the co-organisers for bringing together such a distinguished gathering. I am especially pleased to see so many esteemed representatives from Korean institutional investors, securities firms, asset managers, regulators, and, of course, our colleagues from Hong Kong's financial community.

Hong Kong: what's up

Allow me to begin with a snapshot of Hong Kong's current position, as reflected in international rankings. This year, Hong Kong is once again ranked among the world's top three financial centres. We were also named as the world's third most competitive economy by Switzerland's IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook. Last year, the Fraser Institute of Canada reaffirmed our status as the world's freest economy. Our city continues to enjoy positive credit ratings from all three major international agencies—Fitch, Standard & Poor's, and Moody's—with stable outlooks.

These accolades are not symbolic. They reflect the resilience of our financial markets and the confidence international investors place in Hong Kong. Last year, our stock market rose by 18 per cent, and it has already gained another 20 per cent so far this year. Initial public offerings (IPOs) have raised about $16 billion this year to date, making Hong Kong the world's leading IPO venue so far this year. Meanwhile, total bank deposits grew by 7per cent last year, i.e. about US$13 billion, and again by around 7per cent this year, now surpassing US$2.3 trillion, about 6 times our GDP. Our asset and wealth management sector currently manages around US$4 trillion, and is on track to become the world's top cross-border wealth management centre by 2028.

These positive developments are driven by our strong fundamentals, a steadily growing China and the shifting global financial landscape. At the core of Hong Kong's success are our enduring values: openness, diversity, international character and global connectivity. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong preserves its free port status, with the free flow of capital, information, goods and talent. We uphold the common law system with an independent judiciary. In our Court of Final Appeal, there are six overseas non-permanent judges coming from the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and New Zealand. In the Rule of Law Index of the World Justice Report, Hong Kong ranks among the global top 25, and in the top 10 for free of corruption. Our currency is pegged to the United States (US) dollar and remains freely convertible. The Linked Exchange Rate System functions smoothly despite geopolitical fragmentation, and capital flow volatility.

The Central Government of China has repeatedly reaffirmed time and again that the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement for Hong Kong is not for expediency; it is here to stay for the long term. As a two-way gateway between the Chinese Mainland and the world, Hong Kong plays a unique and indispensable role for the country's high-level two-way opening up.

Indeed, over the past few years, we have gone through some challenges. But once again Hong Kong has restored political stability as well as law and order, and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.

Global dynamics and investment trends

Looking ahead, the global political, economic and financial environment are undergoing profound transformations, and this morning I would like to highlight just three key points. First, the geopolitical climate and the policy uncertainty in the United States. These conditions are expected to persist for some time, and have prompted investors to reassess risk, diversify capital allocations and seek markets that offer both resilience and growth. In this context, Hong Kong stands out as a safe harbour for global capital, providing policy consistency, predictability and strategic access to China and the broader Asian region.

Recent data underscores this momentum. The rally in our stock market since last year has been fuelled by both Mainland and international capital. In February this year, Korean investors made their highest monthly net investment in Hong Kong equities in three years. Very good foresight. And they were not alone. Since September last year, waves of capital from the US and Europe had also poured in, as global investors realised that they had under-allocated to the Greater China market.

We expect continued momentum, especially as more high-quality Mainland tech companies choose Hong Kong over US listings. We are also prepared for the return of Chinese concept stocks from the US.

The geopolitical recalibration is not temporary. It will also go beyond the financial market. Economies in our region are already calling for deeper collaboration across trade, manufacturing, supply chains and investment. This presents exciting opportunities for deeper collaboration between Hong Kong and Korea – two of Asia's most dynamic and sophisticated financial ecosystems.

The second point is the rapid acceleration of technological innovation, an area where Asia holds tremendous promise. For example, in China, we are seeing major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, electric vehicles, green technologies and advanced manufacturing. Open-source AI models such as DeepSeek are emerging as scalable, cost-effective solutions with wide-ranging applications. Increasingly, Chinese firms are turning to Hong Kong to raise capital to support the expansion of their global footprint.

  A recent example is CATL, the world's leading EV (electric vehicle) battery manufacturer, which completed the world's largest IPO so far this year in Hong Kong. The funds raised will support its expansion into Europe, including a new plant in Hungary. Currently, over 200 major Mainland companies are in the pipeline for listing in Hong Kong. Many of them are China's technology and new economy companies.

International investors are increasingly leveraging Hong Kong to take advantage of China's tech sector development. This trend is reflected in the performance of the Hang Seng Tech Index, which has gained more than 40per cent over the past year, driven by renewed investor interest and optimism.

The third point is the increasing importance of cross-border market connectivity. A unique strength of Hong Kong's capital market is our ""Connect Schemes"" with the Chinese Mainland, including Stock Connect, Bond Connect, ETF Connect, and more. These schemes are significant in two ways. First, they allow Mainland Chinese capital to flow into Hong Kong's markets, making us a convergence point for international and Mainland liquidity. Second, they offer trusted and familiar channels for international investors to access the Chinese markets. Today, over 70per cent of A-share holdings by international investors were acquired through the Northbound Stock Connect, and about two-thirds of Mainland cross-border bond transactions are conducted using Bond Connect.

Beyond the Chinese Mainland, we are also expanding mutual market access with other regions. A great example is our growing partnership with Saudi Arabia. In the past two years, we have listed ETFs in our respective stock markets. By the way, one ETF listed on Saudi's market tracking Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was issued by CSOP. It is now the largest ETF in the Middle East.

Indeed, our Exchange-Traded Products (ETP) market is booming. As of May 2025, Hong Kong hosts more than 210 ETPs with over US$65 billion in AUM (assets under management), a 10per cent increase year-on-year. Daily trading volumes had more than doubled compared to 2024, exceeding US$5 billion. This year, there have been 24 new product launches, including the cross-listing of the world's fifth-largest ETF from the US earlier this year.

We are actively encouraging global ETPs to enter the Hong Kong market, whether through direct cross-listings or master-feeder structures. Our ETF ecosystem is becoming more diverse and global, with growing demand for thematic products across stocks, fixed income, commodities, currencies and digital assets. In digital assets, Hong Kong leads Asia with 10 ETPs, including both spot and futures-based ones. Their AUM registered a 74per cent growth year-on-year in the first half of 2025, and a 33per centrise in daily turnover.

Some Korean firms are already active in our ETP market as issuers and market makers. We believe it is now the opportune moment to deepen our collaboration in this space through cross-listings, reciprocal arrangements and master-feeder partnerships.

Our HKEX colleagues will elaborate on these exciting opportunities shortly.

Finally, let me now turn to digital assets, a frontier where Hong Kong is taking bold and forward-looking steps to become a global hub. Our approach is pragmatic, risk-based and innovation-friendly. We believe digital assets will play a transformative role in de-intermediation and cross-border settlement. That said, we are also clear-eyed: appropriate regulatory safeguards are essential.

We have launched a licensing regime for Virtual Asset Trading Platforms, guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"". Sound regulation, we believe, is not a constraint, but a catalyst for sustainable innovation. So far, we have licensed 11 VATPs, with balanced requirements on custody, anti-money laundering and investor protection.

We also support tokenisation across traditional finance, from green bonds to asset-backed security tokens and structured products.

Building on this foundation, we have passed legislation for stablecoins, which will come into effect on August 1. Our goal is to support stablecoins that serve real-world use cases, reducing transaction costs and enabling faster, safer cross-border payments.

Hong Kong's digital asset ecosystem continues to thrive, and many Web3 innovators are choosing to base themselves in our city. We see tremendous potential for Korean innovators and investors as well.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot better conclude by highlighting the compelling advantages we offer to Korean investors: no dividend tax, no capital gains tax, a low profits tax at only 16.5 per cent, trading in multiple currencies, including HKD, USD and RMB, and trading hours aligned with the Asian time zone.

Above all, we are entering a new era for Asia. Geopolitics, technological innovation and regional integration are converging. While they present challenges, they also create unprecedented opportunities. Hong Kong stands ready to be your partner, offering stability in uncertain times, unparalled access to the world's fastest-growing markets, and a platform built on transparency, trustworthiness and innovation.

Together, Hong Kong and Korea can build stronger bridges, unlock new investment frontiers, and shape the future of finance in Asia and beyond.

Kamsahamnida. Thank you."
Speech by FS at Hong Kong - Korea Capital Markets Conference (English only) (with photos),2025-07-09 10:52,2025-07-09 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900263.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong – Korea Capital Markets Conference held in Seoul, Korea today (July 9):

Mr Seo (Chairman of the Korea Financial Investment Association, Mr Seo Yoo-seok), Greg (Managing Director and Head of Markets, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Mr Gregory Yu), Ms Ding Chen (Chief Executive Officer of CSOP Asset Management Limited), ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo. Good morning.

It is a great honour and pleasure to be here with you today in Seoul. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to CSOP Asset Management and all the co-organisers for bringing together such a distinguished gathering. I am especially pleased to see so many esteemed representatives from Korean institutional investors, securities firms, asset managers, regulators, and, of course, our colleagues from Hong Kong's financial community.

Hong Kong: what's up

Allow me to begin with a snapshot of Hong Kong's current position, as reflected in international rankings. This year, Hong Kong is once again ranked among the world's top three financial centres. We were also named as the world's third most competitive economy by Switzerland's IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook. Last year, the Fraser Institute of Canada reaffirmed our status as the world's freest economy. Our city continues to enjoy positive credit ratings from all three major international agencies—Fitch, Standard & Poor's, and Moody's—with stable outlooks.

These accolades are not symbolic. They reflect the resilience of our financial markets and the confidence international investors place in Hong Kong. Last year, our stock market rose by 18 per cent, and it has already gained another 20 per cent so far this year. Initial public offerings (IPOs) have raised about $16 billion this year to date, making Hong Kong the world's leading IPO venue so far this year. Meanwhile, total bank deposits grew by 7per cent last year, i.e. about US$13 billion, and again by around 7per cent this year, now surpassing US$2.3 trillion, about 6 times our GDP. Our asset and wealth management sector currently manages around US$4 trillion, and is on track to become the world's top cross-border wealth management centre by 2028.

These positive developments are driven by our strong fundamentals, a steadily growing China and the shifting global financial landscape. At the core of Hong Kong's success are our enduring values: openness, diversity, international character and global connectivity. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong preserves its free port status, with the free flow of capital, information, goods and talent. We uphold the common law system with an independent judiciary. In our Court of Final Appeal, there are six overseas non-permanent judges coming from the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and New Zealand. In the Rule of Law Index of the World Justice Report, Hong Kong ranks among the global top 25, and in the top 10 for free of corruption. Our currency is pegged to the United States (US) dollar and remains freely convertible. The Linked Exchange Rate System functions smoothly despite geopolitical fragmentation, and capital flow volatility.

The Central Government of China has repeatedly reaffirmed time and again that the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement for Hong Kong is not for expediency; it is here to stay for the long term. As a two-way gateway between the Chinese Mainland and the world, Hong Kong plays a unique and indispensable role for the country's high-level two-way opening up.

Indeed, over the past few years, we have gone through some challenges. But once again Hong Kong has restored political stability as well as law and order, and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.

Global dynamics and investment trends

Looking ahead, the global political, economic and financial environment are undergoing profound transformations, and this morning I would like to highlight just three key points. First, the geopolitical climate and the policy uncertainty in the United States. These conditions are expected to persist for some time, and have prompted investors to reassess risk, diversify capital allocations and seek markets that offer both resilience and growth. In this context, Hong Kong stands out as a safe harbour for global capital, providing policy consistency, predictability and strategic access to China and the broader Asian region.

Recent data underscores this momentum. The rally in our stock market since last year has been fuelled by both Mainland and international capital. In February this year, Korean investors made their highest monthly net investment in Hong Kong equities in three years. Very good foresight. And they were not alone. Since September last year, waves of capital from the US and Europe had also poured in, as global investors realised that they had under-allocated to the Greater China market.

We expect continued momentum, especially as more high-quality Mainland tech companies choose Hong Kong over US listings. We are also prepared for the return of Chinese concept stocks from the US.

The geopolitical recalibration is not temporary. It will also go beyond the financial market. Economies in our region are already calling for deeper collaboration across trade, manufacturing, supply chains and investment. This presents exciting opportunities for deeper collaboration between Hong Kong and Korea – two of Asia's most dynamic and sophisticated financial ecosystems.

The second point is the rapid acceleration of technological innovation, an area where Asia holds tremendous promise. For example, in China, we are seeing major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, electric vehicles, green technologies and advanced manufacturing.

  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

"Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao hold ""open to inclusive, progress together"" joint press conference for NG, NGD and NSOG in Guangzhou (with photos)",2025-07-08 23:00,2025-07-08 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800759.htm,"âThe Guangdong Provincial Executive Committees for the 15th National Games (NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG), the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) (NGCO) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Preparatory Office for the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG in Macao (Preparatory Office in Macao) today (July 8) held a press conference on the topic of ""open to inclusive, progress together"" in Guangzhou to introduce the details of preparation progress for the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG, and the upcoming operational work plan among the three places.

  âThe Director of the Office of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG and Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, Mr Huang Mingzhong; the Head of the NGCO, Mr Yeung Tak-keung; and the Head of the Preparatory Office in Macao, Mr Pun Weng-kun, addressed the conference, highlighting the collaborative progress of the three places. Hong Kong cyclist Wong Kam-po and Macao martial arts athlete Li Yi also shared their aspirations.

  âMr Huang said at the press conference that the cohosting of the 15th NG by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, under the steer of the central ministries including the General Administration of Sport of China and the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has built an innovative co-ordination mechanism. Through close liaison and co-ordination, alignment has been reached in six key areas: cross-boundary events, port clearance, manpower and vehicle accreditation, food safety, green initiatives, and competition schedule. The three places have pioneered a ""three-place three-integration"" cohosting approach - integrated communication, direction, and operation.

  âMr Yeung said, ""Hong Kong firmly adheres to the principles of 'green, inclusive, open and clean' while implementing the requirement of organising a 'simple, safe and wonderful' event. We maintain strict budget control, optimise resource allocation, and prudently scale events to ensure practical preparations."" He highlighted that the cross-boundary athletics marathon and road cycling events, which will be co-organised by Hong Kong, are signature events of the 15th NG, requiring meticulous tripartite planning and co-ordination in route design and expedited clearance for athletes, spectators and vehicles. This cross-boundary collaboration enhances the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)'s overall competitiveness and fosters people-to-people exchanges in the GBA. Wong said that with the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge as the race course, the cross-border road cycling race is an iconic event with beautiful scenery and a challenging course as well.

  âMr Pun said that preparations for the 15th NG have entered the countdown phase. They will collaborate with different sectors of society to strengthen the organisational work for the events, enhancing the atmosphere of community-wide participation in the 15th NG. This includes ongoing visits to communities and schools, connecting with promotional activities for culture, tourism, and sports, and launching franchised products in Macao.

  âVarious franchised products were also showcased at the press conference, with designers explaining their creative concepts. Hong Kong will soon set up sales points in various districts to sell a variety of franchised products related to the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG, including products with unique Hong Kong features.

Miss Law emphasised the potential for Hong Kong and Bordeaux to collaborate in enhancing each other's attractiveness as global tourism destinations.

Miss Law also met with France's Minister for Tourism, Ms Nathalie Delattre, to explore ways to strengthen tourism connectivity between Hong Kong and France. She highlighted Hong Kong's unique offerings, including its gastronomy, arts, sports, traditional festivals, mega events and stunning outdoors as key attractions for French audiences. Miss Law introduced the 2025 Hong Kong Wine and Dine Festival, scheduled for October, as an excellent opportunity for Bordeaux wines to gain greater visibility. Ms Delattre reaffirmed the strong relationship between Hong Kong and France with regards to wine and other fields, and expressed her commitment to fostering collaboration in bilateral tourism.

Miss Law was given a guided tour of La Cité du Vin, Bordeaux's iconic cultural centre and wine museum dedicated to promoting the universal culture of wine. The immersive and sensory exhibits provided an inspirational exploration of wine's journey from ancient civilisations to modern-day winemaking. Miss Law was impressed by its creative storytelling and remarked on the potential for similar initiatives to promote cultural heritage in Hong Kong.

On July 8 (Bordeaux time), Miss Law visited two Bordeaux wineries, Château L’if and Château Le Pin, where she deepened her understanding of Bordeaux's winemaking traditions and explored potential synergies to incorporate Bordeaux wines into Hong Kong's wine tourism initiatives.

After his arrival, he visited the Bank of Korea, the country's central bank, and met with its Governor, Mr Rhee Chang-yong, to exchange views on developments in finance, trade and economic landscapes of the two places, in the region and around the globe, as well as monetary and interest rate policies and investment trends. During the meeting, Mr Chan shared the latest developments in Hong Kong, particularly the continuous capital inflow to Hong Kong's financial system, reflecting international investors' confidence in Hong Kong in the current international environment. He stated that Hong Kong maintains a free and open economic and financial system and the Linked Exchange Rate System under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. Hong Kong's unique advantage of being connected to the Mainland and the world, as well as its highly internationalised characteristics, is further attracting more international participants and capital to enjoy opportunities brought by developments in China. Hong Kong's international ties are continuously deepening.

Thereafter, he visited the Korea Investment Corporation (KIC) and met with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Park Il-young. The KIC was established by the Korean government in 2005, responsible for managing part of the country's foreign exchange reserves and other public funds for overseas investments. Currently, over US$200 billion of assets are under its management. During the meeting, both sides had an in-depth exchange of opinions on various issues of mutual concern, such as trends of investment markets, asset allocation strategies and digital asset developments.

Mr Chan shared recent developments in Hong Kong's economic and financial markets and its important role in connecting capital and investors from China and around the globe. He said that Hong Kong's capital market is closely connected to the Mainland's innovation and technology (I&T) ecosystem. The recent stock market is vibrant, with many leading Mainland I&T enterprises having listed or planning to list in Hong Kong. To international investors, Hong Kong serves as a highly effective gateway to tap into I&T opportunities in Greater China. He welcomed Korean capital to better use the Hong Kong market to allocate international investments and jointly seize the vast business opportunities of I&T developments.

In the evening, Mr Chan had dinner with leaders in Korea's digital asset industry, where he shared Hong Kong's developments and opportunities in digital assets. He also encouraged the local industry to actively participate in the Hong Kong market and jointly explore and expand more applications and developments in digital assets.

Mr Chan will continue his visit to Seoul tomorrow (July 9), including attending a seminar on the capital markets of Hong Kong and Korea, as well as a business luncheon jointly organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Tokyo and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, where he will introduce Hong Kong's new advantages and opportunities to the Korean financial and business sectors."
行政長官會同行政會議批准北環線項目第一部分的財務安排（附圖）,2025-07-08 19:09,2025-07-08 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800439.htm,"行政長官會同行政會議今日（七月八日）批准北環線項目第一部分的財務安排。運輸及物流局與香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）隨後簽訂第一部分項目協議。

北環線項目是支撐香港未來發展的重點運輸基建。北環線主線將成為北部都會區多個新發展區的公共運輸骨幹，配合沿線發展新增人口的運輸需求，提供高效可靠的鐵路服務。而與深圳透過港深跨界軌道基礎設施建設專班攜手推進的北環線支線，則會作為北環線的跨境分支連通港深地鐵網絡，接入新皇崗口岸並提供便捷的「一地兩檢」通關模式，助力香港更好融入國家發展。

為加快推展北環線項目，政府早前與港鐵公司簽訂古洞站項目協議時，已同時要求港鐵公司預留就北環線主線進行詳細規劃及設計和部分前期工程的相關預算。現時相關詳細規劃及設計工作包括法定程序已大致完成，前期工程亦已經開展。

政府發言人表示：「北環線項目的策略價值重大。政府發揮敢於破局的決心，果斷作出了三大突破，為項目提速提效。」

「第一，我們以全盤規劃、分段推展的策略推進北環線項目，將北環線支線連同主線合併作為一個項目進行規劃，以實現協同效益並節省成本。項目再分成兩部分推展以加快進度。現階段簽訂的第一部分項目協議可立即推動項目進展，並同步進行北環線支線的詳細規劃及設計和法定程序。」

「第二，秉持不斷創新的精神，我們正推行多項降低成本和加快建造的策略，並會成熟一項推一項，包括因應項目的跨境元素善用內地方式和能力建造，並在路政署設立專責小組處理審批，精簡項目整體流程和加快程序。這些措施不但可助提高跨境的北環線支線的建造效率，亦有望在一定程度上惠及北環線主線。」

「第三，按照以結果為目標的思維，我們通過引入與鐵路建造相關的內地標準、做法和資源提升建造效率，將北環線支線的規劃大幅提前，目標是與主線在二○三四年或之前同步開通，即較北環線支線原先估計的時間表提早約兩年。」

政府在獨立審核顧問的協助下，已嚴謹審視港鐵公司就北環線項目第一部分提供的財務預算，核實的項目預算約為314億元（按二○二五年七月價格計算）。

行政長官會同行政會議批准，採用「鐵路加物業」模式向港鐵公司批出錦上路站第二期、粉嶺北第13區（東）及第16區、古洞北第22區（東）、第26區（西）、第14區及第15區，和新田第4D區、第6A區及第2A區的用地作住宅及商業用途發展，將來會從按「設有鐵路」基礎評定的十足市值地價中，扣除一筆總數為390億5,000萬元的固定總額（按付款當日價格計算），作為對港鐵公司推展北環線項目第一部分的財務資助。

政府今日與港鐵公司簽訂的第一部分項目協議，會立即啓動較成熟和較迫切的工程，包括北環線主線當中由錦上路站通往牛潭尾車廠連接隧道和由新田站通往古洞站的兩段土木及結構工程，同時要求港鐵公司同步進行北環線支線的詳細規劃及設計，包括環境評估和鐵路方案刊憲等法定程序，並爭取以最快的速度完成。當相關法定程序完成後，便會盡快簽訂第二部分項目協議落實餘下的工程和營運安排。"

Chief Executive in Council approves financial arrangement for Part 1 of Northern Link Project,2025-07-08 19:08,2025-07-08 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800440.htm,"The Chief Executive in Council approved today (July 8) the financial arrangement for Part 1 of the Northern Link (NOL) Project. The Transport and Logistics Bureau and the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) have executed the Part 1 Project Agreement (PA) subsequently.

The NOL Project is a key transport infrastructure in support of the future development of Hong Kong. The NOL Main Line would become the public transportation backbone for multiple new development areas in the Northern Metropolis, providing efficient and reliable railway services to meet the transport demand from new population along the railway alignment. The NOL Spur Line, which is being taken forward together with Shenzhen through the Task Force for Hong Kong-Shenzhen Co-operation on Cross-Boundary Railway Infrastructure, would be a cross-boundary bifurcation of the NOL linking the metro networks of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, connecting to the new Huanggang Port through convenient co-location clearance arrangements and facilitating Hong Kong's better integration into the national development.

To expedite the implementation of the NOL Project, the Government already required the MTRCL to reserve relevant budget to undertake the detailed planning and design as well as part of the advance works for the NOL Main Line when executing the PA of the Kwu Tung Station with the MTRCL earlier. The relevant detailed planning and design including statutory procedures have been substantially completed and the advance works have also commenced.

A Government spokesman said, ""The NOL Project embodies significant strategic value. With a strong determination to break new ground, the Government has resolutely decided to make three major breakthroughs to enhance the speed and efficiency of the project.

  ""Firstly, we would take forward the NOL Project through a holistic planning and staged implementation strategy, planning the NOL Spur Line in combination with the NOL Main Line as one project to achieve synergies and realise cost savings. The project would be implemented under a two-part approach to expedite progress. The execution of Part 1 PA at this juncture could propel the project forward immediately, and in parallel carry out the detailed planning and design as well as statutory procedures for the NOL Spur Line.

  ""Secondly, in the spirit of innovating continuously, we are pursuing various strategies for reducing cost and accelerating project delivery, which would be implemented as soon as ready. Such strategies include leveraging Mainland approaches and capabilities in construction on account of the cross-boundary element of the project, and setting up a dedicated team in the Highways Department to handle building submissions in a manner which streamlines the overall project workflow and expedites procedures. These initiatives will not only improve the construction efficiency of the cross-boundary NOL Spur Line, but may also benefit the NOL Main Line to a certain extent.

  ""Thirdly, adopting a result-oriented mindset, we would improve the construction efficiency through adopting railway-related Mainland standards, practices and resources, substantially bringing forward the planning of the NOL Spur Line. The target is to commission the NOL Spur Line together with the NOL Main Line by 2034 or earlier, which is about two years earlier than what was originally envisaged.""

The Government, supported by an independent checking consultant, has critically examined the financial estimates provided by the MTRCL in relation to Part 1 of the NOL Project, and verified that the capital cost estimate is about $31.4 billion (in July 2025 prices).

The Chief Executive in Council approved the grant of sites at Kam Sheung Road Station Phase 2; Fanling North Area 13 (East) and Area 16; Kwu Tung North Area 22 (East), Area 26 (West), Area 14 and Area 15; as well as San Tin Area 4D, Area 6A and Area 2A to the MTRCL for residential and commercial development under the ""Rail-plus-Property"" model. A total fixed lump sum of $39.05 billion (in money-of-the-day prices) would be deducted from the full market value land premium of the sites assessed on a ""with-railway"" basis in the future as funding support to the MTRCL in implementing Part 1 of the NOL Project.

The execution of the Part 1 PA between the Government and the MTRCL today would immediately kick-start works that are more ready and time-critical, including the civil and structural works of two sections of the NOL Main Line from the Kam Sheung Road Station to the intersection with the approach tunnels to Ngau Tam Mei Depot and from the San Tin Station to the Kwu Tung Station. The MTRCL is required to carry out the detailed planning and design of the NOL Spur Line simultaneously, including statutory procedures relating to the environmental impact assessment and railway scheme gazettal, and strive for completion as early as possible. The Part 2 PA would be executed to finalise the arrangements for the remaining works and operation as soon as possible after completion of the relevant statutory procedures."

LegCo will continue to fully support the development of charitable initiatives in Hong Kong and work collectively to build a fairer, more inclusive and caring society.

A total of 40 members attended the tea reception."
Opening remarks by Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services) at Deloitte's Digital Asset Forum (English only) (with photos),2025-07-08 18:40,2025-07-08 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800687.htm,"  Following are the opening remarks by the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services), Ms Salina Yan, at the Deloitte's Digital Asset Forum ""Digital Assets in Focus - Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance in Hong Kong"" today (July 8):

Eliza (Senior Advisor of Deloitte China Dr Eliza Chan), Duncan (Legislative Council member (Technology and Innovation) Mr Duncan Chiu), Robert (Hong Kong Digital Asset leader of Deloitte China, Mr Robert Lui), friends from the digital asset sector, ladies and gentlemen,

 The Forum today is very timely, as we are standing at a pivotal moment when economies worldwide are striving to chart the course for digital assets and oversight of their use. Hong Kong has been working diligently to stay ahead of the curve in building an ecosystem for the healthy development of the digital asset sector.

 As you know, back in 2022, we announced our first policy statement on digital assets, or virtual assets at the time, setting out our vision to create that comprehensive ecosystem under the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"". Then in June 2023, we put in place a licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms. Now we have a total of 11 licensees with local and international backgrounds. Nine exchange-traded funds with digital underlying assets have also been listed. In May this year, with the support of the Legislative Council, we enacted the Stablecoins Ordinance, making Hong Kong one of the few economies in the world to have a comprehensive law in place on stablecoin issuance. The Ordinance is scheduled to come into effect on August 1, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will begin to accept licence applications.

 This solid groundwork serves as a springboard for the next phase of digital asset development in Hong Kong. The ""LEAP"" framework or metaphor embodied in the second policy statement issued on June 26 conveys a proactive and forward-looking approach. To recap, ""L"" stands for legal and regulatory streamlining, ""E"" for expanding the suite of tokenised products, ""A"" for advancing use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and ""P"" is people and partnership development. These are linked to Hong Kong's unique advantages as an international financial centre, including our comprehensive legal system, sophisticated financial market and infrastructure, close connection with the international markets, and a wealth of professional talents.

 A lot of you are interested in the application scenarios or the ""E"" and ""A"" in the statement. A lot can be said on this. For now, I believe that as a well-developed financial market with a wide range of financial instruments and assets available for trading, Hong Kong has great potential to promote tokenisation of RWA (Real-World Assets). For example, Hong Kong is in a very good position to develop tokenised government bonds, building on our two landmark tokenised government green bond issuances in the past two years and Hong Kong's status as a leading bond issuance hub in Asia. The first batch totalling HK$800 million issued in 2023 was the first tokenised green bond issued by a government entity. The second batch, issued in 2024 denominated in Renminbi, Hong Kong dollars, Euro and US dollars and totalling close to HK$6 billion equivalent, was the world's first multi-currency digitally native green bonds. As announced in the 2025-26 Budget, the Government will regularise the issuance of tokenised bonds.

 I am sure that there are many good ideas about RWA out there in the marketplace. To encourage market participation in developing use cases, thanks to Cyberport, a funding scheme has been launched to support the development of high-impact applications with potential to serve as future use case benchmark.

 On the legal regulatory front or ""L"", right on the next day following the promulgation of the second policy statement, we launched a public consultation on the licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers. This is another big step in making the regulatory regime comprehensive, thus enabling us to manage the risks and harness the potential in different activities along the digital asset value chain, from issuance, trading and dealing, to post-trade custodian service. The two-month consultation period will end in late August. Do let us have your views.

 On the people and partnership front or ""P"", we value stakeholder engagement, and we walk the talk. At the policy level, the Financial Secretary is chairing the Task Force on Promoting Web3 Development. At the regulator level, the Securities and Futures Commission has established a consultative panel focusing on market and regulatory issues. The panel just held its second meeting yesterday. Fora like the one today will certainly provide useful feedback for our work.

 Our policy stance on digital assets is clear. We strive to embrace financial innovations so as to capture their potential benefits, but at the same time we need to put in risk management guardrails with emphasis on investor protection and user education. With this, we look forward to hearing your feedback, and I wish you fruitful discussions. Thank you."

他在抵埗後到訪韓國的中央銀行——韓國銀行，並與行長李昌鏞會面，就兩地、區域和全球的金融、貿易和經濟形勢、貨幣和利率政策、資金流向等議題交換意見。陳茂波在會面上向對方分享了香港的最新情況，特別是資金持續流入香港的金融體系，反映了國際投資者在當前國際形勢下對香港的信心。他指出，香港在「一國兩制」下維持自由開放的經濟和金融體系、聯繫匯率制度，香港內聯外通的獨特優勢和高度國際化的特色，正進一步匯聚更多國際參與者和資金到港，分享中國發展的機遇。香港的國際聯繫正不斷深化。

隨後，他到訪韓國主權投資基金——韓國投資公社，與社長及首席執行長朴日英等會面。韓國投資公社於二○○五年成立，負責管理該國部分的外匯儲備和其他公共資金，用以投資海外項目，目前其管理的資產超過2,000億美元。會面期間，雙方就多個共同關心的議題，包括投資市場的走向、資產配置策略、數字資產發展等，深入交換意見。

陳茂波向對方分享了香港經濟和金融市場最近的發展情況，以及連接中國與全球資本和投資者的重要角色。他指出，香港的資本市場和創投圈緊密連接內地的創科生態，最近新股市場興旺蓬勃，多家內地具領導地位的創科企業已來港或計劃來港上市，對國際投資者而言，香港是參與大中華地區創科機遇的高效門戶。他歡迎韓國資金更多利用香港市場配資國際投資，共同把握創科發展的龐大商機。

陳茂波晚上與韓國數字資產行業的領袖共進晚餐，分享香港在數字資產領域的發展及機遇，並歡迎當地業界更積極參與香港市場，共同探索及開拓更多數字資產的應用及發展。

行政長官在去年的《施政報告》宣布成立發展旅遊熱點工作組，由我擔任組長，並由文化體育及旅遊局局長擔任副組長。工作組的目標是希望加速發掘、推動旅遊熱點項目，透過不同政府單位、組織和持份者的協作，加快項目的起動，豐富香港的旅遊選項、增加香港作為旅遊城市的吸引力。

工作組自成立以來，收集了社會各界不同意見，並審視和討論了多個方案。經考慮後，我們在今年五月二十日公布九個在短期內推出的旅遊熱點項目，分別為：香港工業品牌旅遊、維園市集、添馬紫花風鈴木及簕杜鵑園、特色社區之香港龍城深度遊、特色社區之舊城中環深度遊、開放舊油麻地警署、紀律先鋒巡禮、「四山」旅遊及發展前紅磡鐵路貨運碼頭。

上述項目涵蓋的種類包括工業遊、文化遊、美景遊、深度遊、「打卡」遊、生態遊等，地理上則分布港九新界，體現「香港無處不旅遊」的特色。九個項目中，我們預計七個項目可於今年內推出。

由於九個項目的內容已載述在文件第4至18段，我不擬重複講述。我和同事樂意聽取委員的意見和回答各位的提問。多謝主席。"

十五運會組織委員會辦公室主任、廣東省人民政府副秘書長黃明忠、全運會統籌辦主任楊德強和十五運會及殘特奧會澳門賽區籌備辦公室主任潘永權分別在會上發言，分享粵港澳三地聯動辦會的階段成果。香港單車運動員黃金寶和澳門武術運動員李禕亦有出席簡介會，分享他們對十五運會的期盼。

黃明忠在發布會上表示，粵港澳三地攜手共同承辦十五運會，在國家體育總局、中央港澳辦等國家部委的指導下，建立了具開創性的粵港澳聯絡機制。通過高密度的溝通協商，在六大重點領域達成共識，包括跨境賽事、口岸通關、人車證件、食品安全、綠色辦賽和賽事日程。三地探索出一個「三地三同」的聯合辦賽模式，也就是「同頻溝通、同心決策、同步執行」。

楊德強表示：「香港賽區一直遵循『綠色、共享、開放、廉潔』的辦賽理念，按照『簡約、安全、精彩』的辦賽要求，嚴格做好預算管理，節約成本，控制賽事規模，務實做好各項籌備工作。」他又提到，由香港協辦的田徑馬拉松及公路自行車賽事將會是今屆全運會的亮點。兩個跨境賽事從比賽路線的設計到運動員、觀眾和車輛的快速通關，每一個細節都需要三地政府的共同籌劃和密切配合。這種跨地域的合作模式，不僅提升了大灣區的整體競爭力，亦同時促進大灣區民心交流。黃金寶表示，以港珠澳大橋作賽道舉辦跨境公路自行車賽具標誌性，風景不但優美，賽道亦充滿挑戰。

潘永權表示，全運會籌備工作已進入倒數階段，將與社會各界聯手做好賽事的組織工作，並加強營造全民全運的城市氛圍，包括繼續走訪社區和學校、聯動其他文、旅、體活動進行宣傳、推出澳門賽區特許紀念商品等。

粵港澳三地亦即場展示多款特許經營商品，並由設計師闡述其創作理念。香港賽區稍後將陸續在全港不同地區設銷售點，售賣十五運會和殘特奧會的紀念商品，包括具香港特色的特許紀念商品。

金管局關於離岸人民幣債券回購業務的優化安排,2025-07-08 17:15,2025-07-08 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800614.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月八日）公布有關離岸人民幣債券回購業務（註一）的優化安排，以進一步便利「債券通」（北向通）投資者參與離岸人民幣債券回購業務。具體優化措施包括：

1.支持抵押品債券在回購期間再使用（註二）：

二○二五年二月十日正式推出以來，市場反應積極正面。業務初期，參與機構透過離岸回購交易取得的抵押債券只限於在債務工具中央結算系統（CMU）平台鎖定管理，在回購期間不能再使用。經總結落實以來的經驗和充分考慮市場建議，並與內地監管機構溝通，這次優化措施將按照國際慣例，允許抵押券在回購期間再使用，以提升抵押品使用效率，進一步降低市場機構的融資成本，提升流動性管理效率。

四個使用場景：（a）再次進行離岸回購交易；（b）作為金管局人民幣流動資金安排下的抵押品；（c）作為香港場外結算公司（OTCC）的履約抵押品和（d）通過「債券通」（北向通）進行現券交易。參與機構應遵守各業務場景的相關業務規則和操作規程進行抵押品再使用（例如：若抵押品在回購期間再使用於新的離岸回購交易，則應遵循下述關於離岸人民幣債券回購業務的最新安排要求）。

2.支持外幣結算（包括港元、美元和歐元）：

離岸人民幣回購業務僅限於以人民幣單幣種結算。經本次優化後，可進一步支持多幣種外幣結算，包括港元、美元和歐元，以便利參與機構按實際需要，以持有的在岸人民幣債券持倉進行多幣種資金融通，豐富流動性管理工具，也有助於提升在岸債券的吸引力。

這兩項優化措施旨在對標國際市場慣例、提升市場操作便利，以進一步拓展離岸回購市場的深度和廣度，完善離岸人民幣流動性市場化安排機制，並提升在岸人民幣債券在離岸市場作為抵押品的使用。

上述優化措施將於二○二五年八月二十五日正式啓動。

離岸人民幣債券回購業務的最新安排要求

為便於優化措施的順利推出，現就離岸人民幣債券回購交易，包括利用通過另一宗回購交易取得的抵押債券進行的回購交易，最新安排說明如下：

二、合資格債券：

三、做市商安排：

四、交易及結算安排：

（a）主協議：允許機構間自行選擇回購協議文本（例如全球回購主協議（GMRA）或中國銀行間市場交易商協會（NAFMII）的債券回購交易主協議等）。

有關債券過戶和結算安排的操作詳情將由CMU稍後公布。金管局將繼續密切監察市場情況，確保市場運作穩定有序；並與業界保持溝通，適時檢視進一步優化調整措施，以支持離岸人民幣業務的穩健蓬勃發展。

Enhancement Arrangements for Offshore RMB Bond Repurchase Business announced by HKMA,2025-07-08 17:15,2025-07-08 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800606.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 8) enhancements to the offshore RMB bond repurchase (repo) business (Note 1), to facilitate the participation of Northbound Bond Connect investors in repo business. In particular, the enhancements include:

1. Supporting the rehypothecation of bond collaterals during the repo period (Note 2):

The offshore RMB repo business has been well received by the market since its official launch on February 10, 2025. In this initial phase, the bond collaterals acquired by participating institutions are locked and managed by the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) platform and cannot be re-used during the repo period. In consultation with relevant Mainland authorities and taking into account industry feedback, we will allow rehypothecation of bond collateral during the repo period, bringing this into alignment with international market practice. The enhancement will facilitate more efficient use of collaterals, reduce the financing costs for market participants, and enhance the efficiency of liquidity management.

In particular, bond collaterals can be re-used during the repo period in four specific use cases: a) for re-use in offshore repo transactions; b) as collateral for the HKMA's RMB Liquidity Facility; c) as margin collateral at OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited (OTCC); and d) for cash bond trading through Northbound Bond Connect. Participating institutions shall follow relevant policies and operational rules for the respective use cases when re-using the collateral (for instance, if the collateral is re-used in a new offshore repo transaction during the repo period, the participating institution should follow the latest arrangements of offshore RMB repo business as set out further below).

2. Supporting cross-currency repo (including HKD, USD and EUR):

At present, offshore RMB repo can only be settled in RMB. With the enhancement, settlement in other currencies (including HKD, USD and EUR) will be supported, with a view to facilitating participating institutions' multi-currency funding activities by collateralising onshore RMB bond holdings, enriching their liquidity management tools, and hence increasing the attractiveness of onshore bonds.

These two enhancement measures aim to adopt international market best practices and enhance operational efficiency. They will further expand the depth and breadth of the offshore repo market, improve the market-based mechanism for offshore RMB liquidity management, and broaden the use of onshore RMB bonds as collateral in the offshore market.

The above arrangements will be officially launched on August 25, 2025.

Latest Arrangements of Offshore RMB Repo Business

To facilitate the smooth implementation of the enhancement measures, the latest arrangements for offshore RMB repo transactions (including repo transactions conducted using bond collateral acquired through a repo transaction) are set out as follows:

1. Participating Institutions:

All existing Northbound Bond Connect investors, including CMU members and offshore investors with CMU sub-accounts opened through Hong Kong custodian banks that are CMU members.

2. Eligible Bonds:

Bonds held by participating institutions under Northbound Bond Connect, and bond collaterals acquired through offshore repo transactions, regardless of bond type.

3. Market Maker Arrangement:

The 11 Primary Liquidity Providers designated by the HKMA (Note 3) will serve as market makers. Each repo transaction must involve at least one of these market makers as a counterparty.

4. Transaction and Settlement Arrangements:

(a)Master Agreement: Participants may choose their own repo agreement template (e.g., Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) or National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII)'s Bond Repurchase Master Agreement, etc.).

(b)Trading Arrangement: Transactions may be conducted:


bilaterally over-the-counter;
in the same manner as existing Northbound Bond Connect transactions, and via the linkage between the infrastructures in the onshore and offshore markets;
through offshore electronic trading platforms; or
through onshore electronic trading platform.


(c)Settlement Arrangement: Settlement will be completed under the Repo Service by CMU. Settlement currencies include RMB, HKD, USD and EUR.

5.Data Reporting:

Market makers are required to report repo transaction data (Note 4) to the HKMA on the same day of the transaction for market monitoring purpose. The HKMA will further communicate with the market makers to finalise the reporting requirements and submission channels.

The operational details for bond transfer and settlement will be announced by CMU separately. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor market conditions to ensure orderly market operations. The HKMA will also maintain communication with the industry and review and adjust the arrangements as appropriate to support the robust and sustainable development of offshore RMB business.

Note 1: The HKMA announced the launch of offshore RMB bond repo business on January 13, 2025 (please refer to the HKMA press release). This measure was implemented on February 10, 2025.

Note 2: Operational details will be announced by CMU later. Currently, the rehypothecation of bond collateral is only applicable to repo transactions settled in the Delivery versus Payment model. The timeline for CMU's tri-party repo service to support the rehypothecation of bond collateral will be notified separately in due course.

Note 3: Including 1) Agricultural Bank of China Limited, 2) Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited, 3) Bank of Communications Co., Ltd., 4) BNP Paribas, 5) China CITIC Bank International Limited, 6) China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited, 7) Citibank, N.A., 8) Hang Seng Bank Limited, 9) The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, 10) Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Limited and 11) Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited.

Note 4: The specific information to be reported includes: names of the trading institutions (including both the repo party and the reverse repo party), total amount of funds borrowed by the repo party, bond name, bond code, repo term, total face value, repo rate, transaction/first settlement date, settlement amount, trading platform/means, default-related information etc."

駐成都辦主任袁嘉諾、省港澳辦主任姚紅娟，以及省科協副主席呂建軍首先向來賓和傳媒致歡迎詞。袁嘉諾表示：「國家『十四五』規劃明確支持香港建設國際創新科技中心。陝西省是國家重要的科技工業基地，在能源化工、裝備製造、航空航天等領域實力雄厚。香港和陝西均非常重視創科產業發展，近年來高層互訪頻繁。期待通過深度對接讓香港在稅制、金融、全球網絡等方面的優勢，與陝西的產業根基和創新活力結合，實現『雙向奔赴』。」

姚紅娟亦表示，將積極推動並不斷深化陝港兩地經貿投資，特別是科技創新和新質生產力代表產業的合作交流，協助兩地企業充分把握發展機遇，實現優勢互補。呂建軍隨後於現場致辭。

本次交流會亮點之一，是香港投資推廣署與西安高新區管委會於活動現場簽署合作備忘錄，攜手支持陝西創科企業借港出海，拓展國際市場，標誌陝港兩地在推動中西部地區企業國際化發展方面邁出堅實一步。

西安高新區是國務院首批批准成立的國家級高新區之一。二○二四年，在國家高新區綜合評價中排名全國第五位、位居中西部第一位。區內重點發展光電子資訊、智慧製造、生物醫藥、汽車、新材料新能源等創新產業，成功建立汽車產業、電子資訊兩個千億級產業集群。目前，該區已發展成全球規模最大的閃存晶片生產基地及新能源汽車生產基地。

根據合作備忘錄，西安高新區管委會將鼓勵區內企業利用香港作為拓展海外業務的基地。投資推廣署將提供香港營商環境和政策資訊，以及就企業在港投資和營運提供支援。此次簽署合作備忘錄標誌雙方將建立穩定協作機制，結合香港國際金融中心的獨特優勢與西安高新區的創新動能，助企業連接全球資源，搶佔國際市場先機。

投資推廣署華西地區企業出海專組／招商引才／投資推廣總監干杉立，與西安高新區科技創新局局長高雲天分別代表香港投資推廣署與西安高新區管委會簽署該備忘錄。干杉立簽約後表示：「在發展新質生產力、貢獻國家高品質發展方面，陝港有極大的合作機遇。作為連接內地與國際市場的重要橋樑，香港一直致力為內地創新企業提供全方位支援。希望進一步發揮兩地互補優勢，協助園區內的優質企業借港出海，共同開拓創新合作新機遇。」

投資推廣署創新及科技總裁黃煒卓在推廣香港創科機遇主題演講時表示：「我們擁有多項發展創科的優勢，包括頂尖學術研究與人才庫、世界級研發基礎設施、健全的知識產權保護，以及特區政府的堅定支持。二○二四年，投資推廣署協助的創科公司數量增至120間在香港拓展業務，是該署支援最多的行業，反映出國際對香港創科發展的信心與肯定，也進一步印證香港作為『雙向門戶』的戰略角色。近期，香港創科領域在多方面值得關注，例如首批低空經濟「監管沙盒」試點項目在香港落實，成為推動香港發展的嶄新動力。另外，香港新藥審批機制更新，加速新藥上市進程。我希望陝西省高新科技企業能把握香港多元化機遇，拓展海外市場。」

InvestHK signs MOU with Xi'an Hi-Tech Zone to foster Shaanxi-Hong Kong partnership in empowering enterprises' global expansion (with photos),2025-07-08 16:35,2025-07-08 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800266.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) today (July 8) cohosted the ""Shaanxi-Hong Kong Collaboration: Leveraging Hong Kong Strengths to Support Shaanxi Tech Companies in Going Global"" seminar in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, in collaboration with the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government and the Shaanxi Association for Science and Technology. The event was also co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Chengdu (CDETO), the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's Shaanxi Liaison Unit, Shaanxi Province Xixian New Area Development and Construction Management Committee, and the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone Management Committee.
  
  The Director of the CDETO, Mr Enoch Yuen; the Director-General of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Shaanxi Provincial Government, Ms Yao Hongjuan; and Vice President of the Shaanxi Association for Science and Technology Mr Lv Jianjun delivered welcome remarks to guests and the media. Mr Yuen said, ""The National 14th Five-Year Plan explicitly designates Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology hub, while Shaanxi serves as a key national base for technology and industry, with strong capabilities in energy and chemical engineering, equipment manufacturing, and aerospace, among others. Both Hong Kong and Shaanxi place great importance on the development of the innovation and technology industry, and frequent high-level exchanges between the two places have continued to deepen in recent years. We look forward to deeper collaboration, leveraging Hong Kong's strengths in taxation, finance, and global connectivity, while combining them with Shaanxi's strong industrial foundation and innovative vitality, to achieve a mutually beneficial partnership.""
  
  Ms Yao stated that efforts will be made to actively promote and deepen economic, trade, and investment co-operation between Shaanxi and Hong Kong, particularly in the fields of innovation and technology, as well as new quality productive forces. These efforts aim to help enterprises in both regions seize development opportunities and achieve complementary advantages. Mr Lv also delivered remarks at the event.
  
  One of the key highlights of the event was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between InvestHK and the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone Management Committee, marking a solid step forward for Shaanxi and Hong Kong in promoting the international development of enterprises in the central and western regions.
  
  Xi'an High-tech Zone is one of the first national high-tech zones approved by the State Council. In 2024, Xi'an High-tech Zone ranked fifth in the country and first in the central and western regions in the comprehensive evaluation of national high-tech zones. The zone focuses on developing innovative industries such as optoelectronic information, smart manufacturing, biomedicine, automobiles, new materials and energy. It has successfully built two ""hundred-billion-level industrial clusters"" in the automobile industry and electronic information. At present, the zone has become the world's largest production base for flash memory chips and new energy vehicles.
  
  Under the MOU, the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone Management Committee will encourage enterprises in the zone to utilise Hong Kong as a base for expanding overseas business. InvestHK will provide enterprises with information on the business environment and policies in Hong Kong, as well as support services for companies investing and operating in Hong Kong. The signing of this MOU establishes a structured collaboration framework, combining Hong Kong's unique strengths as an international financial centre and Xi'an High-Tech Zone's innovation capabilities to empower enterprises in accessing global resources efficiently and seizing early opportunities in international markets.
  
  The Head of the Go Global Unit/Business and Talent Attraction/Investment Promotion of Western China of InvestHK, Mr Jason Gan, and the Director of the Science and Technology Innovation Bureau of the Xi'an High-Tech Industries Development Zone, Mr Gao Yuntian, signed the memorandum of co-operation on behalf of their respective sides. Mr Gan said after the signing, ""There are tremendous opportunities for co-operation between Shaanxi and Hong Kong in developing new quality productive forces and contributing to China's high-quality development. As a vital bridge between the Mainland and international markets, Hong Kong has long been committed to providing comprehensive support for Mainland innovation-driven enterprises. We hope to further leverage the complementary advantages of the two places to assist high-quality enterprises in the zone to go global via Hong Kong, and work together to explore new innovative co-operation.""
  
  The Head of Innovation & Technology of InvestHK, Mr Andy Wong, delivered a keynote speech and highlighted Hong Kong's competitive edge in the I&T sector. ""We possess a number of competitive advantages in developing innovation and technology, including world-class academic research and talent, cutting-edge R&D infrastructure, robust intellectual property protection, and the strong support of the HKSAR Government. In 2024, InvestHK supported 120 innovation and technology companies to set up or expand in Hong Kong, making it the top sector among those we assisted. This reflects the international community's confidence in and recognition of Hong Kong's I&T development, and further affirms the city's strategic role as a two-way platform between the Mainland and global markets. Hong Kong's innovation and technology sector has recently made remarkable progress in several areas. For example, the first batch of regulatory sandbox pilot projects for the low-altitude economy has been launched, serving as a new engine for Hong Kong's future development. In addition, the city's new drug approval mechanism has been updated to accelerate the market entry of new pharmaceuticals. I sincerely hope that I&T enterprises in Shaanxi will seize the diverse opportunities offered by Hong Kong to expand into international markets,"" he said.

  Senior Manager of the Leasing and Operations Department of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park Limited Mr Tandy Tan and Associate Director of the Research and Innovation Office of Hong Kong Polytechnic University Mr Victor Zhao also shared the opportunities of the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Center and highlighted Hong Kong's R&D capabilities in empowering new quality productive forces raised from Hong Kong universities. Deputy Director of the Science, Technology Innovation and New Economy Bureau, Shaanxi Province Xixian New Area Ms Han Ping also shared the latest developments on Shaanxi's I&T industry construction centre.
  
  This event featured a panel discussion with industry leaders from professional services in Hong Kong, especially in financial professional services. Guest speakers from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, HSBC and Deloitte Tax shared insights on how Hong Kong's financial and professional services can accelerate Mainland firms' global expansion.
  
  The seminar included a dedicated exchange session to provide on-site consulting services for corporate representatives interested in expanding to Hong Kong. The event attracted 190 representatives from Shaanxi enterprises, institutions and local media."

大家午安。我今日很高興出席授旗儀式，為即將出戰第32屆世界大學生運動會的健兒壯行助威。

大學生運動會是僅次於奧運會的綜合性世界運動會，歷屆比賽均是高手雲集、競爭激烈，今屆比賽亦不例外。來自150個國家及地區的頂尖學生運動員，將會齊聚德國萊茵魯爾，在18個運動項目展開連場精彩的對決，實在令人非常期待。

今年，中國香港將會派出75名健將出戰10個項目。經過長年累月的刻苦訓練，我相信各位運動員早已蓄勢待發。我今日看見你們每一個精神抖擻、鬥志高昂，相信你們抵達德國後，必定會迅速適應當地的時差、氣候和環境，以最佳狀態迎戰各地好手，力爭超越上屆四金、一銀、七銅的成績。

憑藉「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，在這次大學生運動會中，香港運動員能夠以「中國香港」的名義征戰國際體育賽場，實在意義非凡。希望你們珍惜和把握國家為我們提供的寶貴機會，展現精湛的技術和永不言敗的精神，將我們的香港獅子山下精神發揮到極致，為香港和祖國爭光。

特區政府在今年三月完成精英體育資助制度的檢討，並公布由四月起上調每月資助金額，減輕精英運動員的經濟壓力，讓他們更專注於訓練，向體壇高峰邁進。未來，政府會持續為本地運動員創造更優越的條件，助力他們在地區及國際賽場上發光發亮。

在此，我衷心感謝中國香港大專體育協會、各所大專院校、香港體育學院，以及教練、醫療團隊和後勤人員的悉心努力。你們的悉心栽培和鼎力支援，讓本地體壇得以新秀輩出，為長遠發展奠下良好根基。當然，我們也要多謝香港賽馬會對於體育事業的鼎力支持，希望他們會再接再勵，令運動員有更好的發揮。

今日授予代表團的旗幟，不僅是國家地區的象徵，更承載着全港市民的期許。希望各位運動員發揮出色，旗開得勝，滿載而歸！多謝各位。"

因應立法會完善立法會議員履職制度、引入《立法會議員守則》（《守則》）和對《議事規則》作出相應修訂，政府將按立法會建議提交《條例草案》，以修訂《立法會（權力及特權）條例》（第382章）（《條例》），向因違反《守則》而根據《議事規則》被暫停立法會職務的立法會議員施加財政處分。

政府發言人說︰「政府支持立法會完善議員履職制度的建議。現時《條例》有關立法會議員在停職期間須扣起其酬金及津貼的規定，只適用於因議員作出極不檢點行為的情況。根據立法會建議，議員日後因違反《守則》並根據《議事規則》被暫停立法會職務，其停職期間的酬金及津貼同樣須被扣起。修訂亦為立法會提供彈性，以處理立法會將來因根據《議事規則》所批准的其他理由被暫停立法會職務的議員須扣起酬金及津貼的情況。《條例草案》如獲立法會通過，會與《守則》和經修訂的《議事規則》一併於第八屆立法會起生效。」

「政府充分肯定立法會就加強自我監督和自我完善，並增加立法會運作的透明度而採取的措施。《條例》的修訂有助立法會不斷求進，為『愛國者治港』創造更大價值。」

《條例草案》將於明日（七月九日）提交立法會作首讀。"

In light of the Legislative Council (LegCo)'s improvement to the system on the performance of duties by LegCo Members, the introduction of the Code for Members of the Legislative Council, and corresponding amendments to be made to the Rules of Procedure (RoP), in accordance with the LegCo's proposal, the Government will introduce the Bill, which aims to amend the Legislative Council (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance (Cap. 382) to provide for imposing financial penalties on LegCo Members suspended under the RoP from the service of the LegCo due to a breach of the Code.

""The Government supports the LegCo's proposal on improving the system on the performance of duties by Members. At present, the deprivation of LegCo Members' remuneration and allowance in respect of the period of suspension provided under the Ordinance is only applicable to cases of engaging in grossly disorderly conduct. According to the LegCo's proposal, in future, Members who have breached the Code and are suspended under the RoP will also be subject to the same deprivation of remuneration and allowance. The amendments will also provide flexibility to the LegCo to cater for deprivation of remuneration and allowance of Members suspended from the service of the LegCo for other reasons under the RoP as approved by the LegCo in future. Once the Bill is passed by the LegCo, it will take effect starting from the Eighth-Term LegCo in tandem with the Code and the amended RoP.

  ""The Government fully appreciates the initiatives taken by the LegCo to enhance self-regulation and self-improvement as well as transparency of the LegCo's operation. The amendments to the Ordinance will facilitate the LegCo in striving for continual improvement, thereby optimising the contribution of 'patriots administering Hong Kong',"" a Government spokesman said.

The Bill will be introduced into the LegCo for first reading tomorrow (July 9)."
