Flexible handling of Government fees and bills of residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po,2025-12-03 21:25,2025-12-03 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300817.htm,"âIn view of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the Chief Executive has instructed all government departments to be considerate to the residents of Wang Fuk Court, and to provide as much support as possible to them by flexibly handling relevant government fees and bills.

Following this principle, the Immigration Department has waived service charges for residents to replace their identity documents; all injured individuals admitted to public hospitals under the Hospital Authority will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation; and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department will waive fees for columbarium and related services.

A Government spokesperson said today (December 3), ""In order to ease the financial burden on residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po and the families of the deceased during this difficult time, we will waive the affected property owners' and residents' unsettled balance of tax payable for the year of assessment 2024/25 and the provisional tax payable for the year of assessment 2025/26. In other words, they will not need to settle the tax demand notes issued for the year of assessment 2024/25. We will also pay the Government rent on behalf of the affected property owners and residents and waive the rates for domestic tenements that became inhabitable due to the fire.  

""In addition, we will waive the residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po the water and sewage charges of July to November this year. Regarding electricity tariffs and telecommunications service fees, we appreciate the relevant organisations which have offered various support services to the residents of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. For instance, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited has waived the electricity tariffs of November for the affected customers and will arrange deposit refunds to them as soon as possible. Various telecommunications operators have also provided assistance to the affected customers such as offering services fee waivers, free rental of smart phones and free pre-paid SIM cards. In addition, Sinopec (Hong Kong) Gas Company Limited has offered a full waiver of liquefied petroleum gas bills of November for all affected customers."""
發展局局長會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）,2025-12-03 20:55,2025-12-03 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300792.htm,"保安局局長鄧炳強與發展局局長甯漢豪今日（十二月三日）會見傳媒。以下是甯漢豪的開場發言︰

大家好，除了剛才保安局局長交代警方的行動外，屋宇署和房屋局的獨立審查組今日分別去了報道中提及的四個有關屋苑，包括私人屋苑、居屋和租置屋苑涉事承建商的地方，檢取了相關文件。這四個屋苑也分別在早前或今日進行了棚網採樣工作。

基於現時最新情況，我們看到真的懷疑有人在文書上造假，為了保障公眾安全和免除我們現時做大廈維修的業主、住戶心裏的忐忑，政府認為應該從嚴處理。所以我現在宣布，所有現時正進行大維修的樓宇，包括所有公營、私營樓宇和政府大樓，如果它的外牆設有棚網，都需要即時將棚網下架。負責巡查有關項目的各個部門會立即聯絡相關承建商，指示他們在未來三個工作天，即是在今個星期六或之前，完成這個棚網下架的工作。如果個別個案未能做到，他們要預先通報相關的審查部門，由部門審視是否有合理的理由可以作出通融。

根據我們現時的估計，目前如果是私營樓宇正在做大維修而還有棚網的，大約有二百多幢。如果是公營房屋或者是政府大樓的維修項目，大約有十幾宗。這些個案的棚網下架後，屋宇署會爭取在下星期發出新的作業守則，要求所有棚網的物料送到工地時就地採樣，經過指定的檢測所檢測並確定合格後，才可以再上架。因為我們知道這些棚網下架後，就正進行維修的項目，大家都會心急，希望盡快可以恢復外牆工程，所以我們爭取屋宇署下星期就發出有關指引，而其實署方剛才已經立即與業界開始商討這個指引的一些細節。

大家可能會問，接下來幾天這些棚網下架之後，會不會當中有一些不符規的就可以被「放生」。大家可以放心，其實自從這次慘劇發生後，早幾天不同部門，包括屋宇署、房屋局獨立審查組和建築署，分別去了三百多幢正在進行大型維修項目的大樓採樣。以屋宇署的採樣為例，他們做了三百幢私人樓宇。其實每一幢樓宇都是用很嚴謹的方法，在上、中、下，包括一些很高的位置，由棚架師傅幫我們拿了一些樣本下來。所以三百幢樓宇本身已經有數以千計的樣本，現時陸續送去我們指定的化驗所作檢驗。如果遲些化驗報告出來，顯示有一些棚網不符合標準，我們都會追究到底，按我們的《建築物條例》和其他刑事相關的條例去跟進處理。"
CHP recorded another locally acquired case of chikungunya fever,2025-12-03 20:37,2025-12-03 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300774.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 3), the CHP has recorded one new local case of chikungunya fever (CF). The CHP is collaborating with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) to implement appropriate prevention and control measures to minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest case information
------------------------------

The case involves a 23-year-old female living in Queen's Road West in Sheung Wan. A preliminary investigation revealed thatshe developed joint pain on November 27, followed by rash and a fever over the next two days respectively. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department ofQueen Mary Hospital on December 1 and was admitted for treatment. Her blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. She is now in stable condition. The patient's household contact is currently asymptomatic. The CHP is implemented prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to the household contact concerned. If necessary, the CHP will arrange for laboratory testing.

The preliminary investigation also revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. The case is classified as local. Her residence and usual activity areas do not overlap with areas where imported or local cases have been recorded in the recent month. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 77 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, eight were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------------

In response to the new local case, the CHP, together with the FEHD, have inspected various locations in the vicinity of patient's residence and conducted vector investigations andmosquito control operations today with a view to minimising the risk of local transmission.

The CHP urged the members of the public residing and working in Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. The CHP officers will reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind them to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

 Starting tomorrow (December 4), the CHP will set up a health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre from 9am to 6pm to provide assessments to individuals with relevant symptoms. The enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which was set up earlier, will continue to operate daily from 9am to 8pm.

In addition, the CHP will send letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to be vigilant. If there are any suspected CF cases, they should contact the CHP for follow up immediately. The CHP will also inform primary care doctors in Central and Western District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned.

On the other hand, as some confirmed CF cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP continued to urge individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the aforesaid enquiry hotline.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. Pamphlets have been also distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations. The FEHD has earlier requested the relevant departments to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The FEHD also held meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to coordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

各位香港市民、各位記者朋友。

我現在會與發展局局長就懷疑有屋苑維修時使用的棚網涉及行使虛假文書的情況作出報告。警方到目前為止已經就兩宗案件，分別牽涉到柴灣的峰華邨和炮台山的富澤花園，展開調查。

這兩個屋苑的棚網都宣稱是由「山東宸旭化纖繩網有限公司」生產，並宣稱分別獲得由「國家勞動保護用品質量監督檢驗中心」或「濱洲市檢驗檢測中心」發出的棚網阻燃合格檢測報告。但是根據調查所得，「國家勞動保護用品質量監督檢驗中心」並無發出相關證書，至於「濱洲市檢驗檢測中心」，暫時仍無法聯絡，而該公司留下的所有聯絡方法均為空號。

特區政府已經正式立案，會繼續調查，以及嚴肅處理，不論誰犯法都一定會追究到底。現時案件已交由港島總區重案組負責跟進調查。我們預計將會有更多類似案件展開調查。

特區政府已經與內地相關單位聯繫，他們會全面配合我們的調查。除了與內地有關單位聯絡調查之外，在本港方面，我們亦會循棚網由誰提供，以及仍有甚麼其他地方使用過這些棚網展開調查。

現在我交給發展局局長向大家報告。"

衞生防護中心再錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案,2025-12-03 20:25,2025-12-03 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300758.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月三日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱本地個案。中心正聯同食物環境衞生署（食環署）採取適當防控措施，以減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名23歲女子，住所位於上環皇后大道西。初步調查顯示，她於十一月二十七日出現關節痛，其後兩日先後出現皮疹及發燒。她於十二月一日到瑪麗醫院急症室求醫，獲安排留院治療，她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。她有一名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，中心已按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為該名家居接觸者提供醫學監察及健康建議。如有需要，中心會安排化驗檢測。

初步調查顯示，病人在潛伏期內不曾外遊，屬本地感染個案。她的住所和日常活動範圍與近月的輸入或本地個案沒有重疊的地方，流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

本港今年累計錄得77宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，八宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

針對新增一宗本地個案，中心今日已聯同食環署人員實地視察患者家居附近一帶的地點，並進行病媒調查及滅蚊，減低本地傳播的風險。

中心呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

明日（十二月四日）起，中心將於上午九時至下午六時在上環文娛中心正門入口處設立醫護站，為出現相關症狀的市民作評估。而早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）會繼續由上午九時至下午八時運作。

 此外，中心會發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺，如有懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱個案，立即通知中心跟進。中心亦會透過基層醫療署通知中西區的基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

另一方面，鑑於近期部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心繼續呼籲近期曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電上述查詢熱線。

​特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署已進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署亦已要求相關部門在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地。食環署同時向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

連續兩日錄得兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-12-03 18:45,2025-12-03 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300663.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月三日）再接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案。中心再次敦促家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的11歲女童。她於十二月一日出現發燒、咳嗽和神智模糊，同日被帶往伊利沙伯醫院急症室求診，需留院治理，情況一度嚴重。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H3）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發腦病變。她目前仍然留醫，但情況已轉趨穩定。

初步調查顯示，女童居於海外，於十一月二十日到港。女童不曾接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得25宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的16宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度自十月下旬起逐漸下降，但仍高於基線水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會再度上升，加上北半球大部分地區的流感活躍程度持續增加或已處於高水平，市民如計劃外遊，應及早接種疫苗，因為接種疫苗後身體約需兩星期產生抗體，以對流感病毒提供足夠保護作用。由於流感可引致嚴重併發症，中心建議所有年滿6個月或以上的人士接種季節性流感疫苗，特別是孕婦、長者、兒童及長期病患者等高危人士。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as severe paediatric influenza infection cases recorded in two consecutive days,2025-12-03 18:45,2025-12-03 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300662.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 3) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP reiterated its appeal to urge parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccinations also reduce the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves an 11-year-old girl with underlying illness. She developed a fever, cough and confusion on December 1 and was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital on the same day, where she was admitted for treatment. She was in serious condition at one point. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis is influenza A infection complicated with encephalopathy. She remains hospitalised, but her condition has become stable.

A preliminary investigation revealed thatthe girl lives overseas and arrived in Hong Kong on November 20. She has not yet received the 2025/26 SIV. Her household contacts are currently asymptomatic.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 25 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including three fatal cases. The affected children were aged from 6 months to 17 years. A total of 16 cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity has gradually declined since late October. However, it remains above the baseline thresholds. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may increase again. Moreover, influenza activity has continued to increase or reached a high level in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Members of the public who intend to travel should get vaccinated early as it takes about two weeks after receiving SIV for antibodies to develop in the body and provide adequate protection against influenza virus infection. Since influenza can cause serious complications, the CHP recommends that all persons aged 6 months or above receive the SIV, particularly high-risk individualssuch as pregnant women, the elderly, children and those with underlying illnesses,"" the Head of Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially for children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, they should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

政府發言人今日（十二月三日）說：「為了在這艱難時期減輕大埔宏福苑居民和在意外中死亡人士的家屬的經濟負擔，我們將寬免受影響業主及居民二○二四／二五課稅年度的應繳稅款餘額，以及二○二五／二六課稅年度的應繳稅款，換言之他們無需繳交就二○二四／二五課稅年度發出的稅單。我們亦將為受影響業主及居民代繳地租，以及寬免因火災而不能使用住宅的差餉。」

「此外，我們會豁免大埔宏福苑居民於今年七月至十一月的水費及排污費。至於電費及電訊服務費用，我們感謝相關機構已為大埔宏福苑的居民提供不同支援服務，例如：中華電力有限公司已豁免受影響客戶十一月的電費，並向有關客戶盡快安排退還電力賬戶按金；而不同電訊商亦為受影響的客戶提供豁免服務費用、免費借用手機及免費電話儲值卡等支援。此外，中石化（香港）石油氣有限公司已豁免受影響客戶十一月的氣費。」"

Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 36, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (December 2). About 33 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $152,000 and a duty potential of about $112,000, were seized from his personal baggage.

In addition, Customs officers intercepted a 38-year-old female passenger at the airport yesterday, and seized about 38 200 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $172,000 and a duty potential of about $126,000, from her personal baggage.

The two incoming passengers were subsequently arrested. They were both sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $500 by the court today.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Speech by DSJ at Capital of Mediation event (English only) (with photos),2025-12-03 18:25,2025-12-03 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300661.htm,"  Following are the closing remarks by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the Capital of Mediation event under Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 today (December 3):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. Allow me to conclude this afternoon's enriching dialogue and meaningful exchanges with a few words.

  As a true advocate for alternative dispute resolution, the Government has been making consistent and focused efforts in enhancing the culture of communication and understanding within society. Since the introduction of the ""Deepening Mediation Culture"" initiative in the 2023 Policy Address, we have stepped up the promotion of mediation and arbitration services, solidifying Hong Kong's position at the forefront of both global and regional dispute resolution. As this session's theme suggests, Hong Kong is well positioned as the Capital of Mediation.

  From the two panel discussions, with the valuable contributions and sharing from our speakers, we covered the role of mediation from both international and local standpoints. From dealing with inter-state disputes, commercial conflicts, and financial matters to community frictions, it has been shown that mediation can play a crucial role at the national level as well as in various aspects of our daily lives.

  From a global perspective, as a prominent international financial centre, Hong Kong provides not only extensive financial services but also specialised financial-related dispute resolution services. Mediation, in particular, plays a critical role in addressing complex multi-borders financial disputes by offering a fair and efficient resolution process focusing on reaching a solution acceptable to all. This capability reinforces confidence among external investors and businessmen, reassuring them that their interests and property are well protected in Hong Kong.

  On a local level, disputes are more diverse and seldom carry a clear price tag. Issues that impact our daily lives, such as water seepages, noise complaints from shared walls, or disagreements over communal facilities, can be equally stressful and disruptive. Unlike commercial disputes where parties' relationship is primarily contractual, these community conflicts involve people whose lives are closely intertwined, making amicable resolutions even more critical. In these cases, mediation has proven to be the most effective way to restore harmony; indeed, conflicts could well escalate and move from one matter to another if they are not peacefully resolved efficiently. Beyond resolving disputes, mediation also builds trust and encourages collaboration, hence fostering a long-term amicable relationship in the neighbourhood. By offering mediation skills training to property management staff, we trust we can greatly enhance the effectiveness of early intervention in community disputes. We hope after each amicable dispute resolution, the neighbours can continue to treat each other with courtesy and enjoy each other's company in the community.

  Looking ahead, I would like to share some upcoming developments on local mediation. As mentioned in this year's Policy Address, the Government will continue to strengthen the accreditation and disciplinary systems for the mediation profession. Since the establishment of the Working Group on Mediation Regulatory System in 2024, a systematic review of Hong Kong's regulatory framework for the mediation profession has been conducted, resulting in the formulation of seven preliminary recommendations. The Working Group will continue to work on proposing suitable measures for enhancing the sustainable development of the mediation regulatory system.

  Following the completion of the 15th National Games cohosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, we have witnessed the immense potential for growth in the sports landscape in the region. This provides Hong Kong with new opportunities for even more collaboration and development. With this growth comes the need for a neutral, fair and efficient dispute resolution mechanism to address any conflicts that may arise in areas of sports and related business. In this regard, the Department of Justice will soon launch the Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution to promote and support the sustainable development of the sports industry in Hong Kong.

Import of poultry meat and products from areas in Ireland and Japan suspended,2025-12-03 18:25,2025-12-03 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300489.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (December 3) that in view of a notification from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) about an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in County Cavan in Ireland, and a notification from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan about an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Tottori Prefecture in Japan, the CFS has instructed the trade to suspend the import of poultry meat and products (including poultry eggs) from the above-mentioned areas with immediate effect to protect public health in Hong Kong.

A CFS spokesman said that Hong Kong has currently established a protocol with Ireland for the import of poultry meat but not for poultry eggs. According to the Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong imported about 20 tonnes of frozen poultry meat from Ireland, and about 1 540 tonnes of frozen poultry meat and about 219.73 million poultry eggs from Japan in the first nine months of this year.

""The CFS has contacted the Irish and Japanese authorities over the issues and will closely monitor information issued by the WOAH and the relevant authorities on the avian influenza outbreaks. Appropriate action will be taken in response to the development of the situation,"" the spokesman said."
Speech by DSJ at Capital of Mediation event (English only) (with photos/video),2025-12-03 18:25,2025-12-03 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300661.htm,"  Following are the closing remarks by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the Capital of Mediation event under Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 today (December 3):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. Allow me to conclude this afternoon's enriching dialogue and meaningful exchanges with a few words.

  As a true advocate for alternative dispute resolution, the Government has been making consistent and focused efforts in enhancing the culture of communication and understanding within society. Since the introduction of the ""Deepening Mediation Culture"" initiative in the 2023 Policy Address, we have stepped up the promotion of mediation and arbitration services, solidifying Hong Kong's position at the forefront of both global and regional dispute resolution. As this session's theme suggests, Hong Kong is well positioned as the Capital of Mediation.

  From the two panel discussions, with the valuable contributions and sharing from our speakers, we covered the role of mediation from both international and local standpoints. From dealing with inter-state disputes, commercial conflicts, and financial matters to community frictions, it has been shown that mediation can play a crucial role at the national level as well as in various aspects of our daily lives.

  From a global perspective, as a prominent international financial centre, Hong Kong provides not only extensive financial services but also specialised financial-related dispute resolution services. Mediation, in particular, plays a critical role in addressing complex multi-borders financial disputes by offering a fair and efficient resolution process focusing on reaching a solution acceptable to all. This capability reinforces confidence among external investors and businessmen, reassuring them that their interests and property are well protected in Hong Kong.

  On a local level, disputes are more diverse and seldom carry a clear price tag. Issues that impact our daily lives, such as water seepages, noise complaints from shared walls, or disagreements over communal facilities, can be equally stressful and disruptive. Unlike commercial disputes where parties' relationship is primarily contractual, these community conflicts involve people whose lives are closely intertwined, making amicable resolutions even more critical. In these cases, mediation has proven to be the most effective way to restore harmony; indeed, conflicts could well escalate and move from one matter to another if they are not peacefully resolved efficiently. Beyond resolving disputes, mediation also builds trust and encourages collaboration, hence fostering a long-term amicable relationship in the neighbourhood. By offering mediation skills training to property management staff, we trust we can greatly enhance the effectiveness of early intervention in community disputes. We hope after each amicable dispute resolution, the neighbours can continue to treat each other with courtesy and enjoy each other's company in the community.

  Looking ahead, I would like to share some upcoming developments on local mediation. As mentioned in this year's Policy Address, the Government will continue to strengthen the accreditation and disciplinary systems for the mediation profession. Since the establishment of the Working Group on Mediation Regulatory System in 2024, a systematic review of Hong Kong's regulatory framework for the mediation profession has been conducted, resulting in the formulation of seven preliminary recommendations. The Working Group will continue to work on proposing suitable measures for enhancing the sustainable development of the mediation regulatory system.

  Following the completion of the 15th National Games cohosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, we have witnessed the immense potential for growth in the sports landscape in the region. This provides Hong Kong with new opportunities for even more collaboration and development. With this growth comes the need for a neutral, fair and efficient dispute resolution mechanism to address any conflicts that may arise in areas of sports and related business. In this regard, the Department of Justice will soon launch the Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution to promote and support the sustainable development of the sports industry in Hong Kong.

  Lastly, this evening, the mediation lecture will explore an emerging area of dispute resolution - entertainment. Our distinguished lecturer, Professor Sungkee Hong, has come all the way from the Republic of Korea to share distinctive perspectives on this topic.

  As we conclude today's session, we would like to impress upon all of you to take mediation into action and to create a community grounded in understanding, collaboration, and lasting harmony. Thank you."

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for joining us today to discuss Hong Kong's unique and visionary status as the Capital of Mediation.

Hong Kong as the Capital of Mediation is not merely an aspirational slogan but a status built upon a foundation of strong national backing and a distinct identity: rooted in history, reinforced in practice, and recognised in policy. The 14th FiveâYear Plan expressly supports Hong Kong's development as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the AsiaâPacific region. This national endorsement provides the momentum for us to leverage our unique position and project our robust rule of law globally.

Hong Kong's development in mediation began with the Civil Justice Reform initiated in the early 2000s and the pioneering work of the Working Group on Mediation headed by the then Secretary for Justice. These early efforts marked a decisive cultural shift in our legal landscape - from litigation being viewed as the default mechanism for dispute resolution towards embracing mediation as a primary, preferred approach that serves the interests of all parties involved. Today, Hong Kong has built an exceptionally mature mediation culture, anchored by comprehensive legal infrastructure. Effective since January 2013, the Mediation Ordinance provides a robust regulatory framework for mediation, ensuring that it remains a process characterised by confidentiality, flexibility, and reliability. Complementing this is the innovative Apology Ordinance, introduced in 2017, which facilitates reconciliation by allowing expressions of apology without admitting liability. These developments have been powered by concerted efforts across the Department of Justice, the Judiciary, and other key institutions to make amicable settlement the preferred path to justice.

The Hong Kong Judiciary also plays a vital role in promoting mediation as a key dispute resolution tool. Through initiatives like Practice Direction 31 and the establishment of Integrated Mediation Offices, our Judiciary encourages parties to resolve conflicts efficiently and amicably. This supportive stance reflects Hong Kong's commitment to fostering a culture of settlement, reducing litigation costs, and enhancing access to justice.

With a solid and longstanding foundation in mediation, amplified by strong national support, Hong Kong excels as an international mediation hub and as a ""super-connector"" between the Chinese Mainland and the international community. We serve as a neutral bridge between common law and civil law systems, not in theory but in practice. Under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), for example, we have established a specialised mediation mechanism for cross-boundary investment disputes, giving Hong Kong investors and Mainland enterprises an efficient and culturally attuned channel to resolve differences and facilitating integration and building commercial trust along the way.

To ensure this ecosystem thrives from the ground up, the Department of Justice vigorously promotes a ""mediate first"" culture. Key initiatives include the ""Mediate First"" Pledge campaign, which encourages businesses to explore to adopt mediation as a first resort in resolving disputes; the bi-annual Mediation Week, which raises public awareness in sector-specific use of mediation; and a government-wide policy requiring mediation clauses to be incorporated in government contracts. Together with a strong and growing pool of over 2 300 accredited mediators, these efforts are building a dynamic, self-reinforcing mediation culture.

And we carry this story to the world. Through targeted delegations and duty visits across Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, we are not just promoting our services; we are sharing successes, forging new partnerships, and issuing a compelling invitation to the world to collaborate with us in advancing the future of dispute resolution. This is a commitment to building a global community grounded in harmony and constructive problem-solving, the exact principles that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to model and lead as the Capital of Mediation.

In addition to the above initiatives and developments, what has set Hong Kong apart from any other mediation centres in the world and made it the Capital of Mediation is by hosting the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) headquartered right here. The IOMed is the world's first intergovernmental legal organisation exclusively dedicated to mediation as a means for the peaceful resolution of international disputes - filling an important institutional gap that previously existed in global mediation.

Since the signing ceremony of the IOMed Convention held in Hong Kong on May 30 this year attended by around 400 representatives from 85 countries across Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe including officials at the ministerial level from over 30 signatories, as well as high officials from around 20 international organisations, the Convention has already come into effect in August with the IOMed commencing actual operations on October 20 this year. Within just five months, the IOMed achieved the milestones of signing, coming into effect, and beginning operations - an exceptionally rapid pace in the history of international organisation establishment. This fully demonstrates that the establishment of the IOMed is in line with the trend of the times and has received widespread support and positive responses from the international community.

The IOMed will mediate disputes between states or between a state and foreign investors, and international commercial disputes based on the will of relevant parties. Its establishment signals a new era for mediation. It institutionalises mediation at the international level, providing a treaty-based framework that enables states and private parties to engage in bespoke, voluntary mediation processes with the assurance that the outcomes are respected.

As Foreign Minister Wang Yi aptly remarked at the IOMed signing ceremony, Hong Kong was chosen and trusted by the international community to host the IOMed for our unparalleled strengths in international mediation, our affinity to the motherland and connection to the world, our enabling business environment, and highly developed legal system.

The value of mediation and the role of Hong Kong will be further highlighted during the discussion to follow. Today's discussion will start with the keynote address by Mr Alberto Ninio, the General Counsel of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, who will tell us how multilateral development banks and international organisations could engage with mediation. The first session will then examine mediation's rising significance in international disputes, both between states and among private entities, and how tailored frameworks could facilitate the process, as illustrated by the IOMed Mediation Rules. The second session will turn the spotlight to our city's own initiatives, including government efforts to deepen mediation culture and diverse community mediation applications.

As we embark on today's discussions, let us remember the spirit that underpins the Capital of Mediation - a spirit of collaboration, respect, and relentless pursuit of peaceful solutions that benefit all.

Thank you."

The exercise aims to enhance emergency response mechanisms and cross-sectoral collaboration capabilities between Hong Kong, China and neighbouring regions to jointly tackle public health emergencies.

This year, the exercise simulated a scenario on human outbreaks of a novel influenza A infection related to dairy farms, with sustained human-to-human transmissions and further spread to many countries. More than 30 countries and areas in the WPRO region participated in the exercise. During the exercise, the WHO provided information on the scenario to the representatives of the participating countries and areas via videoconferencing and email. Representatives from the DH and other government departments thoroughly discussed the scenario, including the immediate responses, prevention and control measures, and the relevant co-ordination required in Hong Kong, rapidly adjusting the planning according to the evolving scenario. The exercise host of the WPRO concluded the exercise with a debriefing to review the exercise's achievements and explore with participants how to further enhance cross-regional emergency response and collaboration mechanisms.

""Emerging infectious diseases have long posed significant public health threats worldwide. With frequent international population mobility today, emerging respiratory viruses can spread across regions in a short period of time through contact with patients’ secretions or droplets, potentially causing a global pandemic. As a major international transportation hub, Hong Kong faces a significant risk of importation of emerging respiratory infectious diseases. The exercise provided us with a valuable opportunity to strengthen communication and information sharing mechanisms between Hong Kong, China and the WHO WPRO, as well as national focal points of various countries. It also further enhances the cross-departmental collaboration mechanism against emerging respiratory diseases. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) will consolidate the experience gained from this exercise, to opportunely review existing mechanisms in a timely manner, and make more forward-looking arrangements to comprehensively safeguard public health,” the Head of the Communicable Disease Branch, the CHP of the DH, Dr Albert Au, said.

Since 2008, the WPRO has conducted the Exercise Crystal annually to help member countries and regions prevent and respond to cross-regional public health risks affecting population worldwide. Meanwhile, the WPRO maintains close communication with focal points responsible for enforcing the International Health Regulations to ensure that the regions are familiar with the response mechanism to public health emergencies. Being one of the focal points between Hong Kong, China and the WHO, the CHP has actively participated in the exercise for years."

Among the seventh batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering five survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering 13 survey areas in November, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released seven batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in November 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 49 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. October 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Fifteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

十一月份第七批涵蓋五個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及13個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十一月共七批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，49個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有15區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

今年演習模擬乳牛牧場出現一種新型甲型流行性感冒爆發的情景，持續在人與人之間傳播，並進一步擴散至多個國家。西太平洋區域辦事處轄區內30多個國家和地區參與演習。其間，世衞透過視訊及電郵，向參與國家和地區的代表發放模擬情景訊息。衞生署和其他政府部門代表就模擬情景進行深入討論，包括本港應即時採取的應變、防控措施及相關協調工作，並根據情景發展迅速調整部署。世衞西太平洋區域辦事處的演習主持最後作出總結，檢視演習成果，並與參與者交流意見，探討如何進一步完善跨地域應急和協作機制。

衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生說：「新發傳染病一直為全球帶來重大公共衞生挑戰。現時國際人口流動頻繁，新發呼吸道疾病病毒可以透過接觸患者的分泌物或飛沫，在短時間內跨地域迅速傳播，造成全球大流行。香港作為國際交通樞紐，外來傳入新發呼吸道傳染病的風險不容忽視。是次演習為我們提供了一個寶貴機會，強化中國香港與世衞西太平洋區域辦事處及各國聯絡對口單位的溝通和信息通報機制，亦有助進一步提升本港應對新發呼吸道疾病的跨部門協作機制。中心將整合是次演習經驗，適時審視現行機制，以便作出更前瞻性部署，全面保障公眾健康。」

世衞西太平洋區域辦事處自二○○八年起，每年舉辦水晶演習，協助成員國和地區預防及應對跨地域及影響世界各地人口的公共衞生風險，同時與各地負責執行《國際衞生條例》的聯絡單位保持緊密溝通，確保各地區熟習應對公共衞生突發事件的機制。中心作為中國香港與世衞的聯絡對口單位之一，多年來一直積極參與演習。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 2 to noon today (December 3), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 218 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 185 192 samples of food imported from Japan (including 120 260 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 41 314 samples of local catch respectively.

 Members of the public participating in the online bidding should take note of the following important points:

(1) Bidders should register in advance as an E-Auction user by ""iAM Smart+"" equipped with the digital signing function; or by using a valid digital certificate and an email address upon completion of identity verification.

(2) Bidders are required to provide a digital signature to confirm the submission and amount of the bid by using ""iAM Smart+"" or a valid digital certificate at the time of the first bid of each online bidding session (including setting automatic bids before the auction begins) to comply with the requirements of the Electronic Transactions Ordinance.

(3) If a bid is made in respect of a VRM within the last 10 minutes before the end of the auction, the auction end time for that particular VRM will be automatically extended by another 10 minutes, up to a maximum of 24 hours.

(4) Successful bidders must follow the instructions in the notification email issued by the TD to log in to the E-Auction within 48 hours from the issuance of the email and complete the follow-up procedures, including:

(6) Successful bidders will receive a notification email around seven working days after payment has been confirmed and can download the Memorandum of Sale from the E-Auction. The purchaser must apply for the VRM to be assigned to a motor vehicle registered in the name of the purchaser within 12 months from the date of issue of the Memorandum of Sale. If the purchaser fails to do so within the 12-month period, in accordance with the statutory provision, the allocation of the VRM will be cancelled and a new allocation will be arranged by the TD without prior notice to the purchaser.

 The TD has informed all applicants who have reserved the Ordinary VRMs for this round of auction of the E-Auction arrangements in detail by post.

  The Preamble of the Constitution clearly stipulates that ""realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" is a fundamental task for our country. Fully implementing the Constitution is the primary task and foundational work for advancing the country's overall law-based governance and building a socialist state under the rule of law, and has laid a solid foundation for developing socialist modernisation and realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This year's seminar will be conducted on the theme of ""The Constitution and the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation"". The seminar will feature a keynote speech and a panel discussion.

Speech by SJ at Symposium of HCCH Regional Office for Asia and Pacific on Private International Law (English only) (with photo),2025-12-03 11:33,2025-12-03 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300305.htm,"Following are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) on Private International Law under Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 today (December 3):

Dr Christophe Bernasconi (Secretary-General of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH)), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

I am honoured to join you all today at the Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific on Private International Law, co-organised by the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy of my department, as part of the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

In fact, this is the very first time that we co-organised an event with the HCCH during Hong Kong Legal Week. The HCCH is our long-standing partner and we have worked very closely with the HCCH for decades. With the staunch support of the Central People's Government, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been actively participating in the working groups, meetings and activities of the HCCH as part of the Chinese delegation since 1997. Through a standing arrangement with the HCCH, Hong Kong legal talent from both the private and public sectors have the opportunity to be seconded to the Permanent Bureau of the HCCH at the Hague, obtaining valuable insights into the work of the HCCH in the field of private international law.

In 2012, the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific of the HCCH was set up in the HKSAR. Since its establishment, ROAP has played a significant role in increasing awareness and understanding of the importance of the HCCH and its instruments among states and stakeholders, as well as contributing to the smooth implementation and operation of the HCCH's instruments in the Asia-Pacific region.

Today’s Symposium is another example of our long-standing collaborations with the HCCH. We are joined here today by esteemed speakers from different parts of the Asia-Pacific region, who will share their insightful views on topics relevant to the theme of today's Symposium - ""Transnational Litigation & Apostille: Innovating Practices under the HCCH Conventions"".

Hong Kong has long valued the work of the HCCH; a total of nine HCCH instruments are currently applicable to the HKSAR, including the Apostille, Service and Evidence Conventions, which will be discussed in today's Symposium. Back in 1965, the first HCCH Convention which applied to Hong Kong was the Apostille Convention, which is now one of the most widely applied multilateral treaties in the area of legal co-operation with over 125 contracting parties, followed by the Service Convention in 1970 and the Evidence Convention in 1978. Under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", these HCCH Conventions continue to apply to the HKSAR since 1997.

As the timing would suggest, these HCCH Conventions were concluded at a time which is vastly different from today. To adapt to the rapid and ever-evolving technological advancements over the years, the HCCH has developed various innovating practices to facilitate and streamline the functioning of the HCCH's Conventions in this digital age.

These innovating practices include the electronic Apostille Programme (e-APP), which is aimed at supporting the electronic issuance and verification of Apostilles around the world. The HKSAR has also implemented the e-APP in recent years, which will be discussed by Registrar Kwang from the High Court of the HKSAR (Registrar of the High Court, Mr Simon Kwang) during the first panel discussion later today. With respect to the use of digital means under other HCCH Conventions, taking of evidence by video link has been implemented in the HKSAR for some years. In fact, video-conferencing facilities have been used for remote hearings for suitable civil cases of the High Court since April 3, 2020. I will leave further discussion to our experts at the second panel who will share their insights on how digital means could further enhance efficiency in litigation support under various HCCH Conventions.

Ladies and gentlemen, today's theme is timely as we explore how innovating practices, including digital means, can streamline cross-border document circulation and enhance efficiency in litigation support in the context of the HCCH's Conventions. I hope today's Symposium will allow us all to engage in meaningful exchanges and drive forward the future of private international law. Thank you."

Speech by SJ at Symposium of HCCH Regional Office for Asia and Pacific on Private International Law (English only) (with photo/video),2025-12-03 11:33,2025-12-03 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300305.htm,"Following are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) on Private International Law under Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 today (December 3):

Dr Christophe Bernasconi (Secretary-General of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH)), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

I am honoured to join you all today at the Symposium of the HCCH Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific on Private International Law, co-organised by the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy of my department, as part of the Hong Kong Legal Week 2025.

In fact, this is the very first time that we co-organised an event with the HCCH during Hong Kong Legal Week. The HCCH is our long-standing partner and we have worked very closely with the HCCH for decades. With the staunch support of the Central People's Government, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been actively participating in the working groups, meetings and activities of the HCCH as part of the Chinese delegation since 1997. Through a standing arrangement with the HCCH, Hong Kong legal talent from both the private and public sectors have the opportunity to be seconded to the Permanent Bureau of the HCCH at the Hague, obtaining valuable insights into the work of the HCCH in the field of private international law.

In 2012, the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific of the HCCH was set up in the HKSAR. Since its establishment, ROAP has played a significant role in increasing awareness and understanding of the importance of the HCCH and its instruments among states and stakeholders, as well as contributing to the smooth implementation and operation of the HCCH's instruments in the Asia-Pacific region.

Today’s Symposium is another example of our long-standing collaborations with the HCCH. We are joined here today by esteemed speakers from different parts of the Asia-Pacific region, who will share their insightful views on topics relevant to the theme of today's Symposium - ""Transnational Litigation & Apostille: Innovating Practices under the HCCH Conventions"".

Hong Kong has long valued the work of the HCCH; a total of nine HCCH instruments are currently applicable to the HKSAR, including the Apostille, Service and Evidence Conventions, which will be discussed in today's Symposium. Back in 1965, the first HCCH Convention which applied to Hong Kong was the Apostille Convention, which is now one of the most widely applied multilateral treaties in the area of legal co-operation with over 125 contracting parties, followed by the Service Convention in 1970 and the Evidence Convention in 1978. Under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", these HCCH Conventions continue to apply to the HKSAR since 1997.

As the timing would suggest, these HCCH Conventions were concluded at a time which is vastly different from today. To adapt to the rapid and ever-evolving technological advancements over the years, the HCCH has developed various innovating practices to facilitate and streamline the functioning of the HCCH's Conventions in this digital age.

These innovating practices include the electronic Apostille Programme (e-APP), which is aimed at supporting the electronic issuance and verification of Apostilles around the world. The HKSAR has also implemented the e-APP in recent years, which will be discussed by Registrar Kwang from the High Court of the HKSAR (Registrar of the High Court, Mr Simon Kwang) during the first panel discussion later today. With respect to the use of digital means under other HCCH Conventions, taking of evidence by video link has been implemented in the HKSAR for some years. In fact, video-conferencing facilities have been used for remote hearings for suitable civil cases of the High Court since April 3, 2020. I will leave further discussion to our experts at the second panel who will share their insights on how digital means could further enhance efficiency in litigation support under various HCCH Conventions.

Ladies and gentlemen, today's theme is timely as we explore how innovating practices, including digital means, can streamline cross-border document circulation and enhance efficiency in litigation support in the context of the HCCH's Conventions. I hope today's Symposium will allow us all to engage in meaningful exchanges and drive forward the future of private international law. Thank you."

Speech by SFST at Insurtech Insights Asia 2025 (English only),2025-12-03 10:59,2025-12-03 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/03/P2025120300262.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Insurtech Insights Asia 2025 today (December 3):

Kristoffer (CEO of Insurtech Insights, Mr Kristoffer Lundberg), distinguished guests, industry leaders, ladies and gentlemen,

  Welcome again to Hong Kong, and it is a privilege of mine to address all of you today at Insurtech Insights Asia 2025. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the organisers for convening this gathering of innovators who are redefining the boundaries of insurance through technology. This gathering is far more than an event; it is a powerful catalyst for collaboration, imagination, and the bold ideas that will shape the future of risk management across Asia and beyond.

  Hong Kong has long been recognised as one of the world's premier international financial centres. Our strategic position at the heart of Asia, our robust legal system, our deep pool of global talent, and our unwavering commitment to market development have together created a uniquely fertile ecosystem for the insurance sector.

  Today, we host 160 authorised insurers incorporated in Hong Kong, the Mainland, and overseas countries. Six of them are indeed among the world's top 10 insurance groups. Last year, total gross premiums surpassed HK$637 billion, while the industry contributed 3.5 per cent to our GDP (Gross Domestic Product). More tellingly, Hong Kong recorded the highest insurance density in Asia and the second highest globally at over US$8,700 per capita, and an insurance penetration rate of 18.2 per cent - the highest in the world. These are not mere statistics or numbers; they are proof of the trust that individuals, families, and enterprises place in Hong Kong as their preferred centre for managing risk.

  Yet we are not content to rest on these achievements. Under the National 14th Five-Year Plan, the Central Government has endorsed Hong Kong's development as a risk management hub. We are determined to fulfil our role as the ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"" - a two-way springboard that propels Mainland enterprises onto the global stage while inviting international players like all of you to seize the vast opportunities of our nation and the region.

  Technology - particularly insurtech - is the engine that will accelerate this vision. Artificial intelligence, digital distribution, open ecosystems, and resilient cyber infrastructure are no longer optional enhancements; they are fundamental to building an insurance sector that is smarter, faster, more inclusive, and more responsive to the needs of a new generation.

  Earlier this year, our Insurance Authority, whose Chairman and CEO are both here today, completed a survey on AI adoption across our industry. The findings are both encouraging and instructive. Twenty per cent of insurers have already formulated formal AI strategies and are actively implementing solutions. Over half of them are in exploratory or pilot phases, while 40 per cent plan to increase investment over the next two years. Larger insurers are leading deployment, medium-sized firms are formulating strategies, and smaller players are carefully assessing pathways forward. Indeed, generative AI is already transforming customer communication through intelligent chatbots, accelerating information retrieval, and streamlining claims management. Encouragingly, we see a clear shift: from purely internal process optimisation towards powerful customer-facing applications and distribution support.

  These developments, however, also highlight challenges that we must tackle collectively: the availability of skilled AI talent, data quality and availability, budget constraints, regulatory compliance, and the integration of new systems with legacy infrastructure. In response, our Insurance Authority is pursuing a balanced, two-pronged strategy that provides regulatory clarity while actively nurturing innovation.

  On the regulatory front, we will soon issue updated supervisory guidance on the use of AI, ensuring that innovation is always accompanied by fairness, accountability, transparency, and also robust policyholder protection. Industry consultation on the revised guidance will commence by early next year.

  On the development front, I am delighted to highlight the launch in August of the AI Cohort Programme. Seven leading insurers have pledged as core participants, committing to establish an AI Centre of Excellence right here in Hong Kong - a regional hub that will drive innovation, nurture talent through structured capability-building initiatives, and foster knowledge-sharing across the industry and with regulators. The programme provides shared resources, regulatory-compliant testing environments, and matchmaking between insurers and cutting-edge technology providers like all of you. Regular seminars and case-sharing sessions will disseminate best practices and accelerate adoption. Indeed, a core participant will sign a Memorandum of Understanding with Cyberport to leverage its supercomputing resources and AI ecosystem for collaborative proof-of-concept projects in areas such as fraud detection, claims automation, and personalised customer engagement.

  This spirit of experimentation is further embodied in our insurtech-enabling initiatives. Since introducing the Fast Track for virtual insurers, the Insurance Authority has authorised four digital insurers - two in life and two in non-life business. These virtual insurers have been growing in terms of in-force policies and revenue premiums, demonstrating that fully digital models can indeed scale rapidly while maintaining the highest standards of consumer protection.

  The Insurtech Sandbox has also been a resounding success. As of March this year, 43 applications have been approved - many involving remote video onboarding, intermediary-free digital sales of life products, and streamlined application processes. These controlled experiments allow us to test bold ideas in a safe environment, gather real-world evidence, and refine regulation in step with innovation.

  We are equally committed to open ecosystems. The Insurance Authority is working closely with the industry on more than 30 Open API (Application Programming Interfaces) use cases spanning the entire insurance value chain. By fostering interoperability, we are laying the foundation for a truly connected insurance marketplace that benefits consumers and distributors alike.

  In an increasingly digital world, cyber resilience is non-negotiable. In January this year, our Insurance Authority introduced the revamped Guideline on Cybersecurity and the Cyber Resilience Assessment Framework (C-RAF). This framework empowers insurers to assess their own risk exposure and control maturity and to develop targeted remediation plans. It represents a mature, forward-looking approach that keeps pace with evolving threats while preserving flexibility for institutions of different sizes and sophistication.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the initiatives I just said, including AI guidance and the Cohort Programme, virtual insurers, sandbox, Open API, and cyber resilience, are not just isolated measures. Together, they form a coherent, future-oriented framework that positions Hong Kong as Asia's insurtech capital.

  And we are backing this framework with concrete policy support across the broader risk management landscape: the extended Pilot Insurance-linked Securities Grant Scheme, the new risk-based capital regime, the forthcoming review of infrastructure investment capital charges, the newly established commercial marine specialty risk pool, and our continuing efforts to attract captive insurers and international players to our market.

  Hong Kong always stands ready. We offer the deepest insurance market in Asia, a regulatory regime that is both rigorous and responsive, a vibrant technology ecosystem, and an unshakeable commitment to innovation with integrity.

  Let us seize this moment together. Let us harness insurtech to create an insurance industry that is not only more efficient, but also more inclusive, more sustainable, and more capable of protecting the aspirations of customers across our nation and our region. In recent days, our community has been reminded of the profound importance of this mission through a very tragic fire incident, a heartbreaking event that has touched us all. The swift and compassionate response from our insurance sector - facilitating claims processes with efficiency and empathy - has provided vital support to those affected, underscoring the sector's enduring role as a pillar of societal resilience. We stand in solidarity with the families and communities impacted, drawing strength from our shared commitment to safeguard one another in times of adversity like this. I encourage our industry to continue this noble tradition of service, innovating not just for growth, but to fortify the bonds of trust and security that define a caring society. Thank you very much. I wish Insurtech Insights Asia 2025 every success and very much look forward to the ideas shared by Kristoffer and more insights that will emerge from the discussions today. Thank you."

His Excellency Massimo Ambrosetti (Ambassador of Italy to the People's Republic of China), Mr Joseph Lo (Chairman of the Hong Kong Design Centre), Ms Sophia Chong (Executive Director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning.

I would like to extend a warm welcome to all of you especially those of you who have travelled near and far to join us at the grand opening of this year's Business of Design Week (BODW). While I come here with a heavy heart following the recent fire in Tai Po, it gives me much comfort to see that Hong Kong does not face its challenges alone. Thank you for being here today – while our city continues to grieve and bravely confront the aftermath of the fire. Your presence is a meaningful gesture of the support indeed.

Debuting in 2002, the BODW is Hong Kong's flagship annual design event. It has been sponsored for many years by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and its predecessor, CreateHK. In the last two decades, it has grown into a globally acclaimed platform that fosters international exchange and business collaboration. True to its legacy, this year's edition offers a series of thought-provoking programmes, centred around the theme ""Curiosity Ignites Design Innovation"" – reflecting how curiosity fuels creativity across arts, architecture, and manufacturing.

Over the next three days, more than 50 world renowned creative and business leaders will share insights on how curiosity drives creativity and paves the way toward a more sustainable and inclusive future. Masters from various design disciplines will guide us on a journey to rediscover how good design enhances our quality of life – and reimagine how it can help shape a better tomorrow.

This year, we have the privilege to welcome Italy once again as our partner country, building on our successful collaborations in 2007 and 2017. As 2025 also marks the 55th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Italy, this reunion at the BODW is both timely and meaningful. It also reaffirms Hong Kong's role as an East meets‍ West centre for international cultural exchange.

I would like to thank the Hong Kong Design Centre for delivering yet another outstanding BODW programme – one that strengthens Hong Kong's standing as a global design hub. Italy, a country globally celebrated for its design, aesthetics and creativity, will continue to inspire us as we reinforce our role as the creative capital of Asia.

Before I close, I would once again like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for your friendship and for the care you have shown Hong Kong. May you enjoy an inspiring and rewarding creative journey throughout this year's BODW. Thank you."

Original polling stations
Reallocated polling stations upon adjustment


Tai Po Baptist Public School
Hong Kong Teachers' Association Lee Heng Kwei Secondary School


Kwong Fuk Community Hall
Sung Tak Wong Kin Sheung Memorial School


Tai Po Community Centre

Since the electors need to relocate from their original polling stations to the reallocated polling stations for casting their votes, the REO will arrange free feeder transportation services during the polling hours on the polling day to facilitate the voting by the relevant electors at the reallocated polling stations. Details of the feeder services are as below:

Except for those electors of Wang Fuk Court who are currently residing in other districts, the REO will send a notice to affected electors in Kwong Fuk Estate, Tai Po Kau area and Tai Po Market to inform them of their reallocated polling stations. The affected electors may also check relevant voting information starting from 9am tomorrow (December 3) via ""iAM Smart"" or by logging into the Online Voter Information Enquiry System (www.voterinfo.gov.hk). Additionally, the REO will post notices in the buildings where the affected electors reside to inform them of their new polling stations, and will arrange staff to the vicinity of the original polling stations on the polling day to remind electors to proceed to their reallocated polling stations.

For those electors of Wang Fuk Court who are currently residing in other districts due to the fire, the REO will proactively notify them of their reallocated polling station arrangements through social workers under the ""one social worker per household"" service. The REO will also arrange suitable transportation to take the electors to cast their votes at the polling stations upon consulting their voting intentions.

If the affected electors have any enquiries regarding these arrangements, they are advised to call the election hotline at 2891 1001 during office hours."
Government announces updates on Task Forces' follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-02 23:33,2025-12-02 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/02/P2025120200910.htm,"  In view of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po that resulted in multiple casualties, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, today (December 2) announced that an independent committee to be led by a judge will be established to conduct a comprehensive review to examine the cause of the fire and related issues, in order to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.

  Meanwhile, the Government continues to make full efforts in following up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the fire. The latest progress made by various bureaux and departments under the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fundraising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation - led respectively by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, and the Deputy Financial Secretary - is as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po established by the Government, as of noon today, the donations received have reached $2 billion. In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has reached around $2.3 billion. The fund will be used to assist the residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support. The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide the families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 21 cases have been processed, and disbursements are underway. In addition, the Government also announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance of $50,000 to each affected household. As of today, 104 cases have been processed, and disbursements are also underway.

  To provide immediate relief for affected residents, the Government has been offering an emergency subsidy of $10,000 per affected household since the evening of November 27. As of 4pm today, the Government had registered more than 1 930 households for the subsidy, with disbursements made to 1 916 households.

  Social workers of the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 500 affected households so far for registration of the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD also deployed social workers and clinical psychologists to accompany families in attending vigils at the scene today and provided them with emotional support. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households for provision of all necessary assistance while fully backing the support and relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

  As of this morning (December 2), 1 013 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps or hotel rooms. Another 1 607 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units of the Hong Kong Housing Society. In addition, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. As for the other temporary shelter at the Tung Cheong Street Community Hall, it will no longer accept new users but will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to the arranged emergency accommodation.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform (www.taipodonation.hk) established by the Government and the information technology sector began operation on November 30 to facilitate registration of supplies donations from organisations and members of the public. Together with the information provided by members of the public via WhatsApp earlier, the Government has so far received over 860 registrations with different kinds of donation items including food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, beddings and electrical appliances. The Government will consolidate information of all donation items and distribute supplies to residents in need as necessary.

Funeral services
------------------

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has arranged dedicated staff for each family of the deceased to assist them in making funeral arrangements at their preferred time and location. The FEHD has set up a service counter at the Fu Shan Public Mortuary and will proactively contact the families through the social workers of the SWD. Once the families have made decisions, the FEHD will follow up on the relevant arrangements promptly. The FEHD also maintains close liaison with the funeral trade to provide necessary assistance to the families.

   Besides, the Government will waive fees for columbarium and related services, and will provide $50,000 to the families of each deceased individual through the ""one social worker per household"" service to cover funeral and related expenses.

Education support
--------------------

  The school premises of Tai Po Baptist Public School (TPBPS) will remain closed for a certain period of time due to the fire. In order to facilitate early resumption of the normal teaching routine of TPBPS and provide proper care for the students, the Education Bureau (EDB) has co-ordinated with schools in Tai Po District to deploy available classrooms and has arranged for TPBPS students to attend classes by grade level at the school premises of Tai Po Government Primary School and N.T.W.J.W.A Christian Remembrance of Grace Primary School from the middle of this month. The EDB has set up a working group dedicated to implementing the above arrangements. The Government will earmark $5 million to support the operations of the above schools during the transition period and provide appropriate learning and teaching assistance for students and teachers.

Handling of reported missing persons
------------------------------------------

  The Police have earlier completed searches at five buildings and started searching the remaining two most affected buildings yesterday (December 1). Today, 330 officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit (DVIU) were deployed to continue the search. The Fire Services Department (FSD) personnel are also supporting the DVIU by forcing open doors at the scene and providing relevant information. As of 4pm today, the Police handled 13 sets of human remains in the buildings, including five sets of newly found and eight sets found by firefighters but yet to be removed. The number of the deceased has been updated to 156. The Police will continue to follow up on the reported missing persons, aiming to confirm their status and the number of casualties as soon as possible.

  The forensic pathologists from the Department of Health continued to assist personnel from the DVIU on-site in collecting evidence, making every effort to help identify the deceased. As of 4pm today, the next of kin of 116 victims have completed necessary procedures at the Fu Shan Public Mortuary.

Investigations
-----------------

  The FSD continues to take photos and gather evidence at the fire scene, and is discussing with the Lands Department to create a 3D model to assist the investigation.

  The Police have so far arrested a total of 15 people on suspicion of manslaughter, including two individuals from a construction company arrested last night, and 13 individuals from various construction companies arrested earlier. The Police have accorded top priority to the case and are gathering evidence through various channels for a thorough and in-depth investigation. The possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

  The Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau conducted a meeting with structural engineering experts and professionals from the Housing Department (HD) today to study the structure of the buildings in Wang Fuk Court in detail and formulate an action plan for the extraction of concrete cores samples for detailed analysis. Additionally, firefighters are assisting the HD with temporary reinforcement work for 13 units in Wang Cheong Court.

  The ICU today contacted representatives of Sui Wo Court, Ching Lai Court, Yee Kok Court and On Kay Court once again and noted that the registered contractors have proactively started dismantling the protective nets in the respective housing courts. The ICU will continue to monitor the situation. For Wang Chi House, the contractor of the HD will remove the plastic sheeting on the external walls as well as the protective nets after departments, including the FSD and the Labour Department (LD) have completed collecting evidence on-site.

  Relevant departments continued the special inspections of existing buildings undergoing major external wall maintenance, and took samples for testing from buildings installed with scaffold nets. As of today, the Buildings Department (BD) has taken samples from 352 private buildings and sent them for testing in batches. The Architectural Services Department has also inspected all 18 of its public works building projects and collected samples for testing. In order to enhance the accuracy of whether the relevant materials meet the fire-retardant requirements, the departments are adopting rigorous and extensive sampling methods, taking samples from different parts of the external walls of buildings. Due to the large sample size (with thousands of samples being drawn), it will take considerable time to conduct the sampling and testing, and all parties will strive to complete this as soon as possible. Apart from the two buildings where plastic sheeting was found blocking the windows as announced earlier (removed already in accordance with the Government's instructions), the BD did not find other buildings that used foam boards or plastic sheeting to block windows.

  The LD launched a territory-wide special enforcement operation on November 28, targeting the fire protection facilities and fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. This includes checking if protective screens (also known as scaffold nets) on scaffolds are in compliance with recognised standards for fire-retardant materials to safeguard the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 110 construction sites, issued a total of 70 written warnings and 46 improvement notices, and has taken out 11 prosecutions."

A Government spokesperson said today (December 2) that the Chief Executive has announced that the 8th Legislative Council General Election will be held as scheduled for December 7 (Sunday). Following are the latest arrangements regarding the election:

Election forums

Following the outbreak of the fire last Wednesday (November 26), the Government has immediately suspended eight functional constituency election forums, originally scheduled for last Thursday (November 27) through Sunday (November 30), to allow various sectors of society to focus on disaster relief work. As the Legislative Council election will now proceed as scheduled, the eight remaining forums will resume. In light of the current situation, the forums will be adjusted to allow time for candidates to express opinions on supporting work for affected residents and post-disaster recovery. The forums will take place on two consecutive days, tomorrow and the day after (December 3 and 4), with four forums each day.

Polling stations

In view of the fire in Tai Po, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) will make new arrangements for three polling stations in the district. The arrangements will mainly affect voters of Wang Fuk Court, Kwong Fuk Estate, Tai Po Kau and Tai Po Hui. For details, please refer to the press releaseissued separately by the REO today.

Election Fun Day, free admission to facilities and offers

In light of the latest blaze situation, the Government will not hold the Election Fun Day on December 6. Only informative activities will be kept, i.e. ""Election and Me"" roving exhibition to be held at Plaza Hollywood in Diamond Hill. Other carnivals, fun days as well as variety show will be cancelled. The free admission to various facilities arranged by the Government and the offers provided by departments for all members of the public on December 6 and 7 will continue. Details can be found in the attachment. In addition, voters will continue to be presented a thank-you cardas a token of the Government's gratitude to them."
