勞工及福利局局長就輸入勞工及就業支援會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-06-28 16:01,2025-06-28 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/28/P2025062800549.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（六月二十八日）下午出席2025年第二季香港國際人才職業博覽會後，就輸入勞工及就業支援會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：局長，想問近來出現結業潮，今早有議員表示失業人數增加，外勞亦佔據了就業位置，建議當局考慮外勞煞停機制作調整，你們會否考慮？另外，高才通簽證今年中大約有一萬宗到期，現時有否續簽的最新數字？

勞工及福利局局長：我知道大家最近關心香港經濟正處於轉型期，有些行業如金融、貿易等表現很好，當然另外有些行業面對不同情況，包括有些企業結業，大家因而關心勞工權益。在此我想重申，政府輸入勞工政策的最大原則，是保障本地工人優先就業，但若本地工人無法填補企業經營缺口，輸入勞工是其中一個替補辦法令企業繼續經營及擴張。其實輸入勞工只佔整體勞動力約百分之一。我明白大家較關心飲食業的情況。飲食業與其他行業一樣，僱主若要申請輸入勞工，必須先進行四星期本地招聘。若本地求職者增加，或許僱主大部分申請的輸入勞工職位就可由本地人出任，我們可不必批出有關輸入勞工申請，或批出遠較原先申請為低的數目。

另外我亦想和大家分享，以飲食業為例，有些崗位不管經濟怎樣均長期面對人手短缺，譬如洗碗工，多年來均難以聘請足夠人手，輸入勞工在這些工種會扮演較大角色。又以廚師為例，視乎負責哪種菜式，我留意到近期香港出現許多非傳統粵菜系列，如外省菜或其他國家菜式。這些餐廳若要成功經營，難免要聘請一些地道廚師，通過輸入勞工計劃，可令有關企業發展得更快，藉此為本地工人創造更多職位。因此我認為我們應繼續秉持輸入勞工原則，即在確保本地工人優先就業的前提下，容許企業有需要時輸入一定數量非本地勞工。

記者：現時面對飲食業結業潮，昨日亦有戲院宣布結業，本地勞工失業情況增加，會否推出政策協助他們就業？

勞工及福利局局長：我們尤其關心中年至銀齡人士的就業情況，亦很鼓勵大家再就業。我們自去年起推出再就業津貼試行計劃，針對40歲以上、離開職場三個月或以上的人士，若找到工作重投職場完成超過六個月全職工作，可領取最高一萬元津貼；做足一年更可領取最高二萬元津貼。這計劃很成功，我們仍在持續推行，亦希望通過這些計劃協助中高齡人士重投職場。當然，勞工處亦有舉辦其他就業展覽及一系列協助求職的服務，我們會繼續全力推行。"

Speech by FS at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort 20th Anniversary Party - The Most Magical Party of All (English only)(with photos),2025-06-28 13:19,2025-06-28 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/28/P2025062800468.htm,"âFollowing is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort 20th Anniversary Party - The Most Magical Party of All today (June 28):

Jill (President and Managing Director, Disney Parks International, Ms Jill Estorino), everyone,

  Good morning. What a pleasure it is to join you all today to kick off the party celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort!

  For the last two decades, this magical resort has become not only a beloved destination for local, Mainland, and international guests, but also a place where stories come alive and dreams take flight. It has captured the hearts of millions, young and old, and become an enduring symbol of joy, creativity and imagination.

  I still vividly remember that special day in November 2023, when Elsa and Anna graciously invited me to open the World of Frozen. It was truly an unforgettable moment to be part of such a magnificent launch. Since then, I've heard that it has quickly become a favourite among guests from all over the world - especially visitors from Southeast Asia - who have embraced the magic of Arendelle with great enthusiasm.

  Indeed, since opening its gates in 2005, Hong Kong Disneyland has gone through an incredible journey of expansion and transformation, from just four themed lands to eight now. Last year, the Resort welcomed a record-breaking 7.7 million visitors — which is a testament to the enduring appeal and global draw of Disney's magic in Hong Kong.

  And the excitement doesn't stop there. I'm delighted to note that even more extraordinary adventures are on the horizon, with upcoming additional attractions of Pixar and Marvel. These new experiences will continue to delight guests and ensure that the Resort remains a must-visit destination for years to come.

  Hong Kong Disneyland holds a special place in our city's rich collection of tourist attractions. It is a landmark destination, essential to our reputation as a world-class travel hub. But in today's fast-changing world, maintaining that status means we must always stay ahead: innovating and reinventing to meet the changing tastes and expectations of visitors from around the globe.

To keep strengthening the appeal of Disneyland, we look beyond the Resort's gates. More collaboration, more diverse offerings, and more creative partnerships with communities and businesses to create a more immersive and enriched experience for visitors coming to Hong Kong.

The same thinking applies to the tourism sector at large. Through mega events, cultural and sports activities, and new attractions, we are confident that tourist arrivals will continue to rise. But turning numbers into lasting economic impact requires innovation in our offerings.

  And if there's one thing Disneyland has taught us over the years, it's that imagination is the key. It's what fuels the magic behind every story, every ride, every smile. I have no doubt that, with boundless creativity and forward-thinking vision, we will continue to see Hong Kong Disneyland sparkle with even more Disney magic.

  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being part of this celebration. Here's to endless possibilities, boundless imagination and the continuing success and happiness.

  Have a truly magical day!"

Awards presented for Water Safety Campaign slogan and graphic design competitions (with photos),2025-06-28 13:01,2025-06-28 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/28/P2025062700540.htm,"  To enhance public awareness of water safety, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and the Hong Kong China Life Saving Society (HKLSS) jointly organised the Water Safety Campaign 2025. The prize presentation ceremony for its slogan and graphic design competitions for primary and secondary school students was held at the Kowloon Park Arcade today (June 28). Game stalls were also set up at the entrance lobby of the Kowloon Park Swimming Pool's spectator stands to promote water safety.

 Addressing the ceremony, LCSD Assistant Director (Leisure Services) Ms Fung Miu-ling said that beaches are one of Hong Kong's precious natural resources, and oceans are also rich in animal and plant species. To raise the public's safety awareness, the theme of this year's two competitions is ""Some marine organisms may be hazardous to humans. Be vigilant when encountering them"".

 The response to both competitions was enthusiastic. The standard of entries was high, fully demonstrating the creativity and artistic talents of the students. The organisers have used the winning slogans (in Chinese) and graphic designs from both sections to produce two posters for the campaign.

 Last year, the attendance at public beaches and swimming pools under the LCSD was more than 21 million. Ms Fung appealed to members of the public to take heed of water safety advice while enjoying swimming. She reminded the public that before participating in water sports activities, they should pay attention to their physical conditions and check the weather forecast to determine whether everything is suitable for such activities. If they choose to swim at beaches, they should go to the gazetted public ones managed by the LCSD and swim when lifesaving services are provided. People should not conduct any water sports activities during inclement weather.

 The LCSD also thanked the HKLSS for its continued efforts over the years in promoting and organising lifesaving training courses, examinations and competitions, as well as nurturing lifeguards. These efforts have enabled lifesaving services to be maintained at aquatic venues across the city to keep swimmers safe.

  The HA spokesperson reminds the public to stay vigilant on personal and environmental hygiene during the holidays to avoid spreading diseases. Members of the public who develop respiratory symptoms should wear masks and seek medical advice promptly. Non-emergency patients should avoid using accident and emergency (A&E) services and instead seek treatment at GOPCs, private doctors or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es. Members of the public can visit the Health Bureau's Primary Care Directory www.pcdirectory.gov.hk to choose a family doctor and view related clinic service information.

房屋局局長在北京拜訪國務院港澳辦及國家住房和城鄉建設部（附圖）,2025-06-28 10:30,2025-06-28 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/28/P2025062700365.htm,"​房屋局局長何永賢昨日（六月二十七日）在北京進行今次訪問的最後一天行程，拜訪國務院港澳事務辦公室（國務院港澳辦）及國家住房和城鄉建設部。

何永賢先拜訪國務院港澳辦副主任農融，匯報房屋局的工作，包括加強打擊濫用公屋，確保公營房屋資源得以善用，至今已收回約8 700個公屋單位。「簡約公屋」方面，於二○二七年度完成興建約30 000個單位的目標進度良好，其中首個位於元朗攸壆路的「簡約公屋」項目約2 100個單位已順利100%全面入伙，位於牛頭角彩興路的項目約2 300個單位即將於今個月底開始分階段入伙，其餘項目亦正全速推進。房屋局將在七月向立法會提交《簡樸房條例草案》作首讀和二讀，並爭取在今年內完成立法，力求全面落實「簡樸房」的規管工作，讓香港社會告別劣質「劏房」，「早一日得一日」讓基層市民有合理和安全的居住環境。房屋局會持續不斷地優化房屋政策，突破掣肘，做到惠民生、添幸福。

隨後，她亦拜訪了國家住房和城鄉建設部部長倪虹，介紹房屋局的工作以及香港引入內地先進建築科技方面的實際應用情況和成果。她表示，今年房屋局透過一系列活動及外訪，包括十一月在香港舉行的國際性研討會，向世界展示內地和香港建築科技的最新發展，充分發揮香港「內聯外通」的獨特優勢，擔當「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，希望到時世界各地的朋友都可以參加年底由香港主辦的研討會。

何永賢總結這次行程時表示：「是次訪問不僅有機會在亞太住房研究網絡2025年大會上，向不同地區的專家和學者展示香港與內地建築業協同發展的成果, 亦加強香港與內地就智能建造、智慧物業管理、社區建設和房屋政策等方面的交流。此外，為呼應房屋局今年『共築．智能』的主題，是次行程亦加深了解內地先進科技的最新發展。我鼓勵業界以公營房屋為實驗平台，實踐新技術，研發『一地適用，世界通行』的創新建築科技和智慧管理技術，為市民提供幸福居所。」

何永賢昨晚已返抵香港。"
S for Housing calls on Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of State Council and Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development in Beijing (with photos),2025-06-28 10:30,2025-06-28 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/28/P2025062700367.htm,"âThe Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, called on the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) of the State Council and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development yesterday (June 27) on the last day of her visit to Beijing.

Ms Ho first called on Deputy Director of the HKMAO of the State Council Mr Nong Rong, and reported on the work of the Housing Bureau (HB). These include intensified efforts to combat tenancy abuse to ensure the prudent use of public housing resources. Around 8 700 public rental housing units have been recovered so far. On Light Public Housing (LPH), the progress of constructing about 30 000 units in 2027 is good. The intake of the first LPH project with about 2 100 units at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long, has been 100 per cent completed smoothly, while the project at Choi Hing Road, Ngau Tau Kok, with about 2 300 units, will commence intake in phases by the end of this month. The remaining projects are also pressing ahead at full speed. The HB will introduce the Basic Housing Units Bill into the Legislative Council for the first and second readings in July, and strive to complete the legislative work within this year, so as to ensure full implementation of the regulatory work for eradicating substandard subdivided units in Hong Kong and provide a reasonable and safe living environment for the grassroots, the earlier the better. The HB will continue to refine housing policies with sustained efforts, break through constraints to improve people's livelihood, and enhance their well-being.

She then called on the Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, Mr Ni Hong, introduced the work of the HB, and shared the adoption of advanced construction technologies from the Mainland in Hong Kong and the outcomes. She mentioned that the HB will organise a series of activities and visits this year, including an international symposium to be held in Hong Kong in November, to showcase to the world the latest developments of construction technologies in Mainland China and Hong Kong. The HB will fully capitalise on Hong Kong's unique advantages of connecting with both the Mainland and the rest of the world and play the role of a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"". She expressed hope that friends from around the world could attend the symposium to be hosted by Hong Kong at the end of this year.

Concluding the visit, Ms Ho said, ""The visit not only provided an opportunity to showcase the achievements of the collaborative development of Hong Kong and the Mainland construction industries to experts and scholars from different regions at the Asia-Pacific Network for Housing Research 2025 Conference; it also strengthened exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland on smart construction, smart property management, community building and housing policies. In addition, echoing the Housing•I&T initiative of the HB this year, this trip enabled us to gain a better understanding of the latest developments of advanced technologies on the Mainland. I encourage the industry to use public housing as a testing ground for trials of new technologies, and to research and develop innovative construction technologies and smart management technologies that are locally applicable and globally accepted, in order to provide a better living environment for our people.""

Ms Ho returned to Hong Kong last night."

勞工處發言人今日（六月二十八日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-06-28 00:56,2025-06-28 01:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/28/P2025062800049.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (June 28) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

醫務化驗師管理委員會（委員會）於昨日（六月二十六日）與培訓機構及專業團體代表舉行會議，就委員會二○二四年關於課程大綱標準檢討及修訂作詳細說明及溝通。於學時總數維持不變的原則下，修訂四個基本範疇，即臨牀微生物及感染學、解剖病理學、化學病理學及血液學的每項最少臨牀檢驗實習時數要求，調整為50小時。騰出的200小時將可提供更彈性的安排，允許培訓機構靈活分配至新興和急速發展的醫務化驗科目，例如臨牀免疫學、人工智能、分子技術及基因組檢測等，及／或加強學生在基本範疇和新範疇的臨牀檢驗實習。

委員會在會議上重申，整體最少學時總數維持不變，而將此安排視為削減培訓時數實屬誤解。更新後的培訓要求旨在為培訓機構提供靈活性，促進現有及新課程綱要的持續過渡和完善，讓學生在應對迅速發展的醫療技術挑戰時更具競爭力，同時維持專業水平。

根據《輔助醫療業條例》（第359章）及《醫務化驗師（註冊及紀律處分程序）規例》（第359A章）（條例及規例），委員會具有法定職能促進醫務化驗師從業員在專業實務及專業操守方面達到足夠水平。條例及規例明確規訂，所有醫務化驗師必須具備不少於三年在監督下執業的資歷後，當中包括密集在職培訓，方可獨立執業以確保病人安全。

委員會已邀請各培訓機構提交其最新的醫務化驗師培訓課程綱要以供審批。委員會將繼續與醫務化驗師業界、培訓機構及醫護專業保持溝通，以確保病人安全及提升專業水平。"
Medical Laboratory Technologists Board meets representatives of training institutions and professional associations,2025-06-27 21:47,2025-06-27 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700728.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Medical Laboratory Technologists (MLT) Board:

âA meeting was held by the MLT Board yesterday (June 26) with representatives of training institutions and professional associations to provide detailed explanations and communicate on the decision of the MLT Board in 2024 about the review and amendment of accreditation criteria of programmes, in maintaining the total required hours for training, to amend the minimum hours for clinical practice/attachment in the major four basic areas, namely ""Clinical Microbiology & Infection"", ""Anatomical Pathology"", ""Chemical Pathology"" and ""Haematology"" to 50 hours each, with the released 200 hours for training institutions to flexibly allocate to new and rapidly evolving medical laboratory science subjects, such as clinical immunology, artificial intelligence, molecular techniques and genetic testing etc., and/or to perform enhanced clinical practice/attachment in the four basic areas as well as in the new areas.

The MLT Board reiterated at the meeting that the overall minimal training hours would remain unchanged, and it was a misunderstanding to perceive the arrangement as cutting down training hours. The updated training requirement would facilitate training institutions with the flexibility to enable continuous transition/improvement of the curriculum both in existing and new programmes, to better prepare our students for the challenge of quickly evolving medical technologies, while maintaining professional standards.

Under the Supplementary Medical Professions Ordinance (Cap. 359) and the Medical Laboratory Technologists (Registration and Disciplinary Procedure) Regulations (Cap. 359A) (Ordinance and Regulations), the MLT Board was empowered to promote adequate standards of professional practice and conduct among members of the profession. The Ordinance and Regulations specified that all MLTs must obtain at least three years of post-qualification experience involving intensive on-the-job training under supervision before they could practise independently to ensure patients' safety.

The MLT Board had invited institutions to submit their updated curriculum on the training of MLT for approval. The MLT Board will continue to communicate with the MLT industry, training institutions and healthcare professions to ensure patient safety and enhance professional standard."

Charles (Yang) (Council Chairman of the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts(HKAPA), Mr Charles Yang), Professor Anna Chan (Directorof theHKAPA), å¼µå¿è¯å¯ä¸»ä»» (Deputy Director-General of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the People's Government of Guangdong Province Mr Zhang Zhihua), ææ¬å¯é¨é· (Deputy Director-General of the Department of Publicity, Cultural and Sports Affairs of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Lin Nan), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is both an honour and a privilege to join you tonight in celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.

Allow me to begin by extending my warmest congratulations to the Academy. For four decades, you have stood as a pillar of performing arts education and creative innovation in Hong Kong, shaping the artistic landscape of our city and beyond.

Since its founding in 1984, the Academy has played a vital role in nurturing generations of world-class talent in performing arts and arts technology. From drama to music, and from dance to film and television, your graduates have brought to life a rich tapestry of performances and productions that have captivated audiences, enriched our cultural fabric, and deepened public appreciation for arts and culture.

The many acclaimed film makers nurtured by the Academy is a compelling example. Their works and productions have defined Hong Kong cinema and extended its influence far beyond the territory, being recognised as a cultural force across the region and around the world.

Today, the global entertainment industry is massive and rapidly evolving. It is also a multi-billion dollar business. In recent years, we have seen the rise of cultural powerhouses from this part of the world like Korea. And the Mainland is emerging as an important player as well. Despite changing market trends and challenges, Hong Kong producers continue to shine. The recent success of local productions, such as ""Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In"" ãä¹é¾åå¯¨ä¹ååãand ""The Last Dance"" ãç´·å°çã, stands as a testament to the enduring strength of our creative industries. It tells that we can capture the hearts of local, Mainland and international audiences with quality productions. It is the innovative spirit, artistic excellence, and a bold embrace of new technologies that will drive the future of the industry.

Meanwhile, for performing arts, our unique connectivity with the Greater Bay Area, together with world-class performing venues offers unparalleled opportunities for our arts groups and performers. Opportunities to expand their reach, build their brands, and step confidently onto the regional and global stage. Seizing these opportunities requires not only talent and capital, but also vision, passion and an unwavering commitment to excellence.

In fact, a flourishing arts and creative sector is not only a powerful engine of economic growth, but also an important pillar of soft power.

In a world increasingly marked by fragmentation and conflicts, we must ask ourselves: do we need more confrontation, or more dialogue? More isolation, or greater understanding? I believe the answer is clear to all of us. And in this connection, arts and culture are a profound and irreplaceable means of fostering mutual understanding, empathy and unison.

Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to contribute to this global dialogue. With our openness, diversity and international character, there is no better place than Hong Kong to be an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. And through your work - your performances, your productions, your stories - I am sure the perspectives of Hong Kong, and of our country, will be better shared by the world. 

In advancing these strategic goals, the Academy has been, and will continue to be, an important partner.

That is why, in the 2022 Policy Address, the Government entrusted the Academy with an important new mission: to deepen its role in talent development for the Greater Bay Area, and to broaden its educational footprint through the establishment of a new campus in the Northern Metropolis. This initiative reflects both our confidence in the Academy's capabilities and our shared aspiration to elevate performing arts across the region.

As the Academy looks to the future, let us remember: talent is the key to our continued success - and indeed the success of any institution, industry and society.

I have every confidence that the Academy will remain true to its founding mission, and continue to cultivate the next generation of artists not only with skills and creativity but also with vision, heart and passion.

And I have every confidence too, that the Academy will rise to the challenges and capture the opportunities ahead, strengthen its international presence, and flourish as a premier performing arts institution - not only in Asia, but on the world stage.

On this note, I wish the entire Academy community - your dedicated faculty, talented students and accomplished alumni - every success as you continue your pursuit of artistic excellence with passion, purpose, and pride.

Once again, my heartfelt congratulations to the Academy. May you continue to inspire, innovate and illuminate. And may the next chapter of your journey be even more brilliant than the last. Thank you."

Immigration Department holds launching ceremony of illustrated book on consular protection and outbound travel safety and exhibition on 20th anniversary of 1868 Assistance Hotline (with photos),2025-06-27 21:27,2025-06-27 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700764.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) held a launching ceremony of an illustrated book on consular protection and outbound travel safety and an exhibition on the 20th anniversary of the 1868 Assistance Hotline at the Immigration Headquarters in Tseung Kwan O today (June 27).

  Guests attending the launching ceremony included the Director of Immigration, Mr Benson Kwok; Olympic diving gold medallist Ms Guo Jingjing; the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk; the Director-General of the Consular Department of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs(OCMFA) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Wei Wenxiu, representatives from the Education Bureau (EDB), as well as representatives and students from schools in Tseung Kwan O.

  Speaking at the launching ceremony, Mr Kwok said that consular protection has always been the most solid backing for Hong Kong people travelling abroad. With the full support of the OCMFA and the Chinese diplomatic and consular missions overseas, the Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit (AHU) of the ImmD is committed to providing practicable assistance to Hong Kong residents in distress outside Hong Kong. At the same time, the ImmD attaches great importance to promoting outbound travel safety. Over the years, it has collaborated with the OCMFA from time to time to organise various publicity activities to raise people's awareness of outbound travel safety, while enhancing their understanding of national consular protection and the work of the AHU.

  To promote consular protection provided by the country and reach a wider audience, the ImmD has published an illustrated book for children, featuring 1868 Ambassador Ah Bong, the AHU's mascot. The book aims to help primary and kindergarten students recognise the importance of consular protection, thereby strengthening their sense of belonging to the country. It will be distributed to over 1500 primary schools and kindergartens across the territory, and its electronic version will also be uploaded to the ImmD and EDB webpages for teachers' reference and use.

  This year marks the 20th anniversary of the 1868 Assistance Hotline. Starting today until July 25, the ImmD will be hosting an exhibition on the ground floor of the Immigration Headquarters to introduce the public to the consular protection provided by the country and the services of the 1868 Assistance Hotline, together with relevant information on outbound travel safety. The exhibition will be open to the public free of charge from 8.45am to 4.30pm, Monday to Friday, and from 8.45am to 11.30am on Saturday (except public holidays)."

海關人員於昨日（六月二十六日）在落馬洲支線管制站截查該名四十三歲抵港女旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲一千三百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約五千六百元，應課稅值約四千五百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

 Customs officers intercepted the incoming 43-year-old female passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point yesterday (June 26) and seized 1 381 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $5,600 and a duty potential of about $4,500 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

 Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

 Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

The exhibition will run at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre from tomorrow (June 28), featuring significant Tang dynasty artefacts unearthed on the Mainland and in Hong Kong to showcase the inclusiveness, diversity and openness of the prosperous Tang dynasty, and introduce Hong Kong's pivotal role in the Maritime Silk Road.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, said that, as one of the celebration activities of the 28th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland, this is the largest joint exhibition, in terms of profile, scale and quantity of artefacts on display, since the signing of the Framework Agreement on Deepening Exchange and Cooperation in the Field of Heritage Architecture and Archaeology between the DEVB and the National Cultural Heritage Administration in 2022. The exhibition marks a move towards a higher level of mutual co-operation. Hong Kong is an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. She is eagerly anticipating that the exhibition can showcase the culture of the majestic Tang dynasty to members of the public and friends from all over the world.

Other officiating guests at the ceremony were Deputy Administrator of the National Cultural Heritage Administration Mr Qiao Yunfei; the Secretary General of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Wang Songmiao; the Permanent Secretary for Development (Works), Mr Ricky Lau; the Director of Art Exhibitions China, Mr Tan Ping; the Chairman of the Antiquities Advisory Board, Professor Desmond Hui; and the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Built Heritage Conservation, Professor Douglas So.

The exhibition is divided into eight sections on the administrative system and governance of the Tang dynasty, the planning of Chang'an city, the life of people, religious beliefs, literati elegance, craftsmanship, prosperous scenes along the Silk Road and Maritime Silk Road, and Hong Kong's role as a node on the Maritime Silk Road in the Tang dynasty. It features 269 significant pieces/sets of artefacts from 28 museums and cultural institutions in 10 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities on the Mainland (including 49 pieces/sets of grade-one cultural relics) and 29 pieces/sets of important artefacts unearthed in Hong Kong and dated to the Tang dynasty.

Among the key exhibits are two paintings, namely the ""Scroll depicting Emperor Minghuang playing polo"", which is a Song dynasty depiction of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (Minghuang) playing polo with his concubines on horseback; and the hanging scroll of Li Bai's ""Chun Ye Yan Tao Li Yuan Xu"" (preface to the spring night banquet in the peach and plum garden) on kesi (cut silk) depicting the refined life of Tang dynasty literati. These paintings will only be displayed during the first two months (June 28 to August 27). Other key exhibits include a sancai teaware set with a seated figurine revealing the image of Lu Yu, China's sage of tea; a gold jie comb (hair comb accessory) carved in openwork from a thin piece of gold; a painted figurine of a dancing black man with exotic charm; the ""Lun Yu Zheng Xuan Zhu"" (the Analects with annotation by Zheng Xuan) copied by Bu Tianshou, which has been included in the first batch of the National Catalogue of Precious Ancient Books; and a crimson gold walking dragon used in ritual ceremonies, which will be displayed throughout the entire exhibition period.

The exhibition also displays significant Tang dynasty artefacts unearthed at Chek Lap Kok, Tung Chung and San Tau on Lantau Island in Hong Kong, including ceramic ware, iron weapons, bronze belt ornaments, silver chai hairpin, glass ring, fragment of silver piece, Kai Yuan Tong Bao (circulating treasure from a new era) and Qian Yuan Zhong Bao (heavy treasure of Qian Yuan reign) bronze coins, to illustrate the role of Hong Kong in the Maritime Silk Road.

The exhibition will run at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park, Haiphong Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, from tomorrow to December 31 with free admission.

Caritas Medical Centre announces sentinel event,2025-06-27 19:20,2025-06-27 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700746.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for Caritas Medical Centre (CMC) announced a sentinel event today (June 27):

A 48-year-old female patient with good past health was admitted to the hospital's surgical ward on June 17 for abdominal pain. The patient underwent an abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast on June 18 which indicated early appendicitis, mild colitis and a small paratubal cyst on the right side.

On the same night, the patient was arranged for an emergent minimally invasive laparoscopic appendectomy operated by a higher surgical trainee. During the operation, oozing from the surgical site was noted, and the small paratubal cyst was torn during the procedure. The on-call Associate Consultant was called in. The Associate Consultant arrived and consulted the Obstetrics and Gynaecology team at Princess Margaret Hospital, where it was confirmed that a cystectomy was not required as the bleeding had stopped. The patient remained in stable condition after the operation and continued to receive close observation and treatment. The excised tissue was sent to the pathology department for examination.

On the afternoon of June 23, the patient developed a low-grade fever with increasing abdominal pain and afterwards underwent an abdominal CT scan with contrast again. The report revealed the appendix remained intact and the pathology report, which was available in the late evening of June 25, showed that the excised tissue was a fallopian tube instead of the appendix.

The hospital is very concerned about the incident and met with the patient and her family on the following morning (June 26) to explain the details of the incident and to offer their sincerest apologies. Subsequently, the patient underwent an operation to have the inflamed appendix removed. The operation was uneventful. The hospital will continue to closely monitor her post-operative recovery.

The preliminary investigation suggests the doctor involved mistook the fallopian tube for the appendix due to tissue adhesion near the surgical site.

âThe CMC once again extended sincere apologies to the patient, and has requested the Department of Surgery to review the arrangements and handling of laparoscopic surgeries, including staffing deployment, task assignment, supervision and coaching. Training for frontline healthcare staff will also be strengthened to ensure proper management of every procedure-related detail to safeguard patient safety.

The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority Head Office via the Advance Incident Reporting System. A root cause analysis panel will be formed to investigate the incident thoroughly. The investigation and recommended improvement measures will be completed within eight weeks.

The Root Cause Analysis Panel members are as follows:

Chairperson
Dr Sara Ho
Service Director (Quality and Safety), Hong Kong East Cluster

Vivian（香港機場管理局（機管局）行政總裁張李佳蕙）、機管局同事、各位機場同業：

今日在此濟濟一堂，很高興見到大家。今日是我云云眾多工作之中最期待的一個，因為一想到機場便自自然然很開心、很興奮，不只想起去旅行，工作也很開心。

今日主題很好，因為今次是三跑道落成之後的新時代中，在擴容和提升運力後，機管局和勞工處再一次舉辦職業博覽會。剛才我匆匆經過展覽攤位，覺得和一般在勞工處舉辦的招聘博覽會不同，這不僅是一個招聘，而且是展示香港國際機場和香港作為國際航空樞紐的實力。

說到實力，雖然大家也很熟悉，但正如行政長官經常勉勵我，好東西不怕多說，所以我也要在大家面前再講一次，亦希望透過傳媒讓市民大眾掌握到我們的實力，因為國際機場是我們的「金漆招牌」，是很多同業多年來的努力。

我首先說說貨運。我們第14年作為全球最繁忙貨運機場的首位，這是得來不易的。即使近來不同傳媒，包括本地或海外傳媒，問及我關於在關稅影響下，對我們的航空航運，以至物流有何影響，其實我想由數字已經看到，首五個月，每月貨運量都非常亮麗，平均達到40萬公噸。我很希望我們今年會很有把握再下一城，當然這需要大家一起努力及支持。

說到客運，我們都很努力，因為疫情後，雖然我們開關比一些機場慢，但復蘇的速度簡直好像火箭那樣快。我們回看首五個月的客運量已經達到2 500萬，而這數字同比增長超過20%，近來單日高峰，大概是復活節期間，達到近20萬人次，每日1 100架次。試想一個這麼繁忙的機場需要多少人手呢？雖然我們現在說科技、無人駕駛，盡量多自動化，但是在機場裏，不只是操作運輸或物流、航空貨運，其實滿載都是人和人之間的關係，所以正正需要吸引多元化的人才。

除了我們「金漆招牌」的數據，另一方面我認為很值得鼓舞是機管局你們的領導，給予社會前瞻性的發展路向，就是發展機場城市SKYTOPIA。SKYTOPIA給予我們發展的契機，尤其對於人才方面，不只管理的崗位，屆時SKYTOPIA是包羅萬有，會有零售、餐飲、文化創意、旅遊、展覽，及各種科技創新、遊艇經濟的項目。以後機場再招聘時，不知道你可以怎樣再增加攤位，最好就是透過科技、動畫，讓大家感受到這簡直是一個很大的發展空間，而吸引的人才都要靠我們大家繼續培育。

很高興見到Simon（香港國際航空學院校長李天柱）今日在場，我們對香港國際航空學院都很期待，希望你們可以訓練、培育，更可以留住人才。但不只是靠你們，政府亦有海運及空運人才培訓基金。透過這個基金，我們希望助力不同培育機構、大學或職業學校的培訓項目，為我們加速培育多方面人才。

即將有一個很開心的項目，就是香港國際航空學院最近與全球首屈一指的飛機拆解和部件公司——就此，我希望日後有更多確實的數字和故事，可以大力宣傳——很開心的是首先就與他們簽署備忘錄，讓年青人看到有新領域可以開拓，亦正正為我們作為香港國際航空樞紐作多元化和深化發展。

剛才Vivian講了很多關於作為在機場島工作的一分子，在全方位、一條龍方面有甚麼配套。除了幼兒服務、運動室、canteen很出名的奶茶及下午茶餐外，我有一項感受特別深、亦是我的弱項，就是運動。我看到這幾年透過你們一條龍的配套設施，訓練了很多體育精英，無論長跑、短跑，甚至是電競。我認為吸引年青人，希望大家能一邊工作、一邊發掘體育潛能，是一個賣點——可能遲些你們再發掘唱歌、跳舞等——各方面都可以幫助大家吸引年青人，最重要是我們給予他們希望及活力。

我們要匯聚人才，不只在機場島，與機場有關的行業是各式各樣，超越了機場島以外的地方。今日我很希望透過職業博覽會接下來三日活動，進一步讓同業互相交流，當然亦很希望有實質成果，就是吸引到有人簽約，亦很希望透過我們的努力——未來一年是辛苦的，會有很多工作給大家機場同業去做，因為大家開拓了這麼多的領域，需要承傳，我們要有年青的一代去接棒。我們亦希望有多元化的人才，豐富我們的思路，令未來發展路向更加豐富、多元和更有活力，以服務香港和國家作為己任。多謝大家。"
明愛醫院公布一宗醫療風險警示事件,2025-06-27 18:40,2025-06-27 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700709.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

明愛醫院發言人今日（六月二十七日）就一宗醫療風險警示事件有以下公布：

一名四十八歲過往健康良好的女病人，在六月十七日因腹痛入住本院外科病房。病人在六月十八日進行腹部電腦掃描造影檢查，報告顯示病人患有早期闌尾炎、輕微結腸炎，右側輸卵管旁有一細小囊腫。

同日晚上，病人獲安排緊急進行手術，由一名正接受進階外科專科訓練的醫生，使用腹腔鏡進行微創闌尾切除手術。在手術進行期間，手術位置曾出現滲血，在處理過程中輸卵管旁囊腫亦出現撕裂情況，主刀醫生即時請示當值的副顧問醫生。該名副顧問醫生隨即到達手術室參與手術。在諮詢瑪嘉烈醫院婦產科醫生意見後，確認成功止血後毋須把囊腫切除。病人在完成手術後情況穩定，繼續留院接受觀察及治療；而被切除的組織亦送交病理部進行病理化驗。

六月二十三日下午，病人出現低燒並腹痛加劇，隨後醫生安排病人再次進行腹部電腦掃描造影檢查，報告顯示闌尾仍然存在；而於六月二十五日傍晚發出的病理化驗報告顯示日前被切的組織為輸卵管，而非闌尾。

本院非常關注事件，翌日（六月二十六日）早上馬上向病人及家屬解釋事件和表達衷心歉意，隨即安排為病人切除發炎的闌尾。手術順利完成，醫護團隊會持續密切監察病人術後的康復進度。

初步調查懷疑由於手術部位附近一帶有組織粘連，導致醫生把輸卵管誤認為闌尾。

明愛醫院對病人再次表達衷心歉意，已要求外科部門重新檢視有關腹腔鏡手術的安排及處理，包括人手安排、工作分配及督導指引，加強對前線醫護人員的培訓，確保妥善處理手術相關的各項細節，以保障病人安全。

院方已透過早期事故通報系統向醫院管理局總辦事處通報事件，並會成立根源分析委員會作詳細調查，於八星期內完成報告並提出改善建議。

根源分析委員會成員名單如下︰

Revised arrangements under Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme to be implemented starting tomorrow,2025-06-27 18:05,2025-06-27 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700682.htm,"The Social Welfare Department (SWD) announced today (June 27) that it will implement revised arrangements under the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme starting from tomorrow (June 28), in which Injury Grant and Interim Maintenance Grant of the Scheme will be merged into Compassionate Grant (CG).

An applicant eligible for CG will receive $330 per day for a maximum of 60 days of sick leave. Subject to meeting other relevant eligibility criteria, a CG applicant must obtain certification from a registered medical practitioner (including a registered Chinese medicine practitioner) that his/her injury requires hospitalisation for no less than seven days or sick leave for at least seven days. An applicant can only apply for CG once within two years. The SWD will adjust the assistance amount of CG annually in accordance with the established mechanism.

An SWD spokesman said that the Government has no intention to alter the original policy intent of the Scheme. The revised arrangements, approved by the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council today, aim to enhance the Scheme so that it can provide modest but timely relief to victims of traffic accidents in a sustainable manner, help victims overcome short-term financial difficulties, ensure proper use of public resources, and prevent abuse and fraudulent behaviour. For persons with financial difficulties or other welfare needs, the SWD will provide them with appropriate support, including referring them to apply for the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance or other assistance.

The revised arrangements will apply to the applications involving traffic accidents that happened at or after 00.00 hours tomorrow. Victims of traffic accidents that happened before 00.00 hours on June 28, 2025, can still apply for Injury Grant and Interim Maintenance Grant under the Scheme, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility criteria.

The arrangements for the other three grants under the Scheme, namely Burial Grant, Death Grant and Disability Grant, will remain unchanged.

Details of the Scheme are available on the SWD's website (www.swd.gov.hk/en/pubsvc/socsecu/trafficacc)."

海關人員於五月二日在香港國際機場截查一名二十八歲抵港女旅客，並在她攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約二十一公斤未完稅雪茄，市值約二十四萬六千元，應課稅值約九萬元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買未完稅煙草，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

Customs officers intercepted a 28-year-old incoming female passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on May 2. About 21 kilograms of duty-not-paid cigars, with an estimated market value of about $246,000 and a duty potential of about $90,000 in total, were seized from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys duty-not-paid tobacco commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en)."

教育局局長蔡若蓮博士擔任主禮嘉賓，她致辭時表示，香港作為中西薈萃的國際大都會，需要大量掌握良好兩文三語能力的人才，發揮作為超級聯繫人的重要角色，同時鞏固作為亞太區乃至全球的國際教育樞紐的地位。而要落實國家「十四五」規劃中香港發展「八大中心」的定位，抓住「一帶一路」和粵港澳大灣區發展的機遇，也必須掌握好兩文三語。在「一國兩制」之下，兩文三語便成為香港教育的優勢之一。

她表示，教育局和語常會多年來一直攜手推廣兩文三語，近年推出的措施包括透過運用語文基金，資助教師參加普通話水平測試，鼓勵教師提高普通話水平；向學校發放推廣自主學習英語及普通話的一筆過津貼，提升學生自主學習能力及兩文三語水平。期望「兩文三語運動」在大家同心協力下，能增強香港的語言和人才資本，讓香港發揮「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的優勢。

在典禮上，語常會主席陳黃麗娟博士感謝2025年「兩文三語運動大使」張敬軒、各方機構和各界人士的支持，令「兩文三語運動2025」圓滿成功。她特別感謝張敬軒及來自不同界別的人士透過短片分享學習語言的心得與個人經歷，展現兩文三語如何在個人和職業發展中發揮關鍵作用。她亦感謝社區合作夥伴推出既引人入勝又別具意義的比賽和活動、各校積極參與「一分鐘短片製作比賽」，以及教育界和各行各業的合作夥伴在製作兩文三語宣傳短片上的協助。

陳黃麗娟博士指出，學生語文大使將在推動提升社區語言能力方面擔當重要角色。語常會將繼續與教育局、合作夥伴及重點行業攜手推動語言學習，致力提升香港市民的語言能力。

在典禮上，大會頒發了「一分鐘短片製作比賽」的獎項。得獎作品由學生精心製作，融入充滿活力的創意元素，充分展現其兩文三語的能力，並有效推廣香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心和國際教育樞紐的角色。

一眾社區合作夥伴，包括循道愛華村服務中心社會福利部、聰穎教育慈善基金及香港教育工作者聯會，邀請活動優勝者在典禮上表演或分享。有關內容豐富有趣，學生展現了出色的語言能力，充分體現運用兩文三語的精髓，熱烈氣氛為典禮增添喜悅與活力，亦為「兩文三語運動2025」畫上圓滿句號。

閉幕暨頒獎典禮在香港青年協會大廈舉行，約400位來自商界、文化藝術界、社區團體的嘉賓，以及老師、家長和學生出席。有關典禮及「兩文三語運動2025」的詳情，可瀏覽語常會網頁（scolarhk.edb.hkedcity.net/tc/Biliteracy_and_Trilingualism_Campaign），或語常會的社交媒體專頁。"

  To promote the sustainable development of Hong Kong's DA ecosystem while protecting investors and managing risks, the Government and financial regulators have been closely monitoring market developments and maintaining dialogue with industry stakeholders to continuously review and enhance Hong Kong's regulatory framework for DA activities.

  In this regard, the FSTB conducted a public consultation between February and April last year on the legislative proposals for establishing a licensing regime for DA over-the-counter service providers. Based on the feedback received, the FSTB, in collaboration with the SFC, has revised the legislative proposals. By launching the public consultation today, the FSTB and the SFC seek to gather views from stakeholders on the framework and key elements of the revised legislative proposals.

  The revised legislative proposals cover the licensing regime for DA dealing service providers and the licensing regime for DA custodian service providers. Under the two proposed licensing regimes, the SFC will be the standard setter, responsible for formulating regulatory requirements applicable to licensed and registered DA dealing and custodian service providers.Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will be the frontline regulator for banks and stored value facilities (SVFs) registered to provide the relevant services. Both the SFC and the HKMA will be provided with the powers to implement the regimes in accordance with the statutory requirements.

  The key elements of the proposed licensing regimes are as follows:

(1) Licensing Regime for DA Dealing Service Providers

* Any person who carries on a business of providing DA dealing services in Hong Kong will have to be licensed by or registered with the SFC;

*Irrespective of whether the relevant DA dealing services are provided through a physical outlet and/or other platforms, both simple dealing services (e.g. smaller-scale conversions between different DAs or between DAs and fiat money) and more complex services (e.g. brokerage activities, block trading activities, and other activities of advisors or asset managers) will fall under the scope of the licensing regime;

*Licensed or registered providers of DA dealing services will need to meet fit-and-proper criteria and comply with a range of regulatory requirements, including those related to financial resources, knowledge and experience, risk management, financial reporting and disclosure, conduct of business, information and notifications, record keeping, proper protection of client assets, and investor protection safeguards; and

*The licensing regime will be fully implemented on the date the relevant statutory provisions come into effect, with no deeming arrangement.

(2) Licensing Regime for DA Custodian Service Providers

*Any person carrying on a business in Hong Kong of providing DA custodian services will have to be licensed by or registered with the SFC. The provision of DA custodian services as a business will be defined as - by way of business, the safekeeping of (i) DAs on behalf of clients; or (ii) instruments enabling transfer of DAs of clients (including but not limited to private keys) on behalf of clients; and

*Same as DA dealing services, licensed or registered providers of DA custodian services will need to meet fit-and-proper criteria and comply with a range of regulatory requirements, including those related to proper protection of client assets, financial resources, knowledge and experience, risk management, financial reporting and disclosure, conduct of business, information and notifications, and record keeping. Similarly, the licensing regime will be fully implemented on the date the relevant statutory provisions come into effect, with no deeming arrangement.

  The consultation papers are available on the webpages of the FSTB and the SFC:

*Licensing Regime for DA Dealing Service Providers (www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/en/publication/consult/doc/VADEALING_consultation_paper_en.pdf / apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/consultation/doc?refNo=25CP6)

*Licensing Regime for DA Custodian Service Providers (www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/en/publication/consult/doc/VACUSTODY_consultation_paper_en.pdf/ apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/consultation/doc?refNo=25CP7)

  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""We have the public consultation on the establishment of licensing regimes for DA dealing and custodian service providers launched today, right after our release of the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong yesterday. By this, we want to deliver an important message to the public that while we are striving to build Hong Kong into a premier global hub for DAs, upholding investor protection is still our utmost concern. The proposed licensing regimes will lay a solid foundation for us to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for DAs with investor and customer protection at its core. The move will also help realise our vision to build Hong Kong's DA ecosystem into a highly trusted one that will flourish sustainably and responsibly in a risk-managed manner, thereby delivering concrete benefits to the real economy and financial markets.""

  The Chief Executive Officer of the SFC, Ms Julia Leung, said, ""The proposed introduction of the regulatory regimes for dealers and custodians would complete a digital asset ecosystem that is both safe and vibrant for institutional and retail investors. In balancing industry growth with robust investor protection, we join hands with the Hong Kong SAR Government to build Hong Kong into a trusted and sustainable platform that taps into global liquidity. We will also stay committed to close collaboration with our industry stakeholders to broaden participation and further raise the vibrancy of Hong Kong's ecosystem.""

  The FSTB and the SFC welcome views from the public and stakeholders on the proposed licensing regimes. Submissions should be sent by post (24/F, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong) or by email to the FSTB on or before August 29, 2025:

* Licensing Regime for DA Trading Service Providers: vadealing-consult@fstb.gov.hk
* Licensing Regime for DA Custodian Service Providers: vacustody-consult@fstb.gov.hk

  During the consultation period, the FSTB and the SFC will also meet with relevant sectors to gather feedback.

Note: The term ""digital asset"" includes ""virtual asset"". As ""virtual asset"" is a legally defined term under the existing Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615), the term ""virtual asset"" is still adopted in the consultation papers in this public consultation. The Government will review whether another term should be used in the legislation in lieu of ""virtual asset"" so as to better reflect the nature of this asset class, and align with the understanding across international markets.

CHP investigates measles infection case epidemiologically linked to earlier cluster,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700678.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (June 27) is investigating a case of measles infection and reminded the public that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles.

The case involved a 29-year-old female who is a family member of the two epidemiologically linked measles infection cases announced by the CHP recently. During the contact tracing, the CHP found that the mother of the six-month-old baby boy, who had been infected with measles earlier, developed a sore throat around June 9. She later developed a cough and transient fever. The CHP arranged for her to attend Kwong Wah Hospital for testing. Her blood sample tested positive for antibodies of measles virus upon laboratory testing. She has recovered now.

An epidemiological investigation revealed that the female patient was not certain whether she had ever received measles vaccination.The CHP continues to investigate the cases to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that no epidemiological linkages have been established between these three cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

""The incubation period of measles (i.e. the time from infection to onset of illness) is seven to 21 days. Symptoms include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. When such symptoms appear, people should wear surgical masks, stay home from work or school, avoid crowded places and contact with unvaccinated people, especially those with weak immune systems, pregnant women and children under 1 year old. Those who suspect they are infected should consult their doctors as soon as possible and inform healthcare workers of their history of exposure to measles,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""Under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, the overall immunisation coverage in Hong Kong has been maintained at a very high level through the immunisation services provided by the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres and School Immunisation Teams. As evidenced by the findings on vaccination coverage of primary school students and the territory-wide immunisation surveys conducted regularly by the DH, the two-dose measles vaccination coverage has remained consistently high, well above 95 per cent, and the local seroprevalence rates of measles virus antibodies reflect that most people in Hong Kong are immune to measles. However, Hong Kong, as a city with a high volume of international travel, still faces the potential risk of importation of the measles virus and its further spread in the local community. Hence, a small number of people who have not completed a measles vaccination (such as non-local-born people including new immigrants, foreign domestic helpers, overseas employees and people coming to Hong Kong for further studies) are still at risk of being infected and spreading measles to other people who do not have immunity against measles, such as children under 1 year old who have not yet received the first dose of the measles vaccine,"" he added.

People born before 1967 could be considered to have acquired immunity to measles through natural infection, as measles was endemic in many parts of the world and in Hong Kong at that time. People born in or after 1967 who have not yet completed the two doses of measles vaccination or whose measles vaccination history is unknown, should consult their family doctors as soon as possible to complete the vaccination and ensure adequate protection against measles.

The number of measles cases in some overseas countries remains at a high level this year. The outbreaks in North America (including the United States and Canada), Europe and neighbouring areas (including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines) are ongoing due to the relatively low vaccination rate. Furthermore, an increasing number of measles cases have also been recorded in Japan and Australia this year. For those who plan to travel to measles-endemic areas, they should check their vaccination records and medical history as early as possible. If they have not been diagnosed with measles through laboratory tests and have never received two doses of measles vaccine or are not sure if they have received a measles vaccine, they should consult a doctor at least two weeks prior to their trip for vaccination.

Besides being vaccinated against measles, members of the public should take the following measures to prevent infection:


Maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
Keep hands clean and wash hands properly;
Wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharge properly;
Clean used toys and furniture properly; and
Persons with measles should be kept out of school till four days from the appearance of a rash to prevent the spread of the infection to non-immune persons in school.

EDB and SCOLAR organise Closing cum Award Presentation Ceremony of Biliteracy and Trilingualism Campaign 2025,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700247.htm,"The Education Bureau (EDB) and the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR) held the Closing cum Award Presentation Ceremony of the Biliteracy and Trilingualism Campaign 2025 today (June 27) to celebrate the success of activities in promoting biliteracy and trilingualism across various sectors of society over the past six months.

Officiating at the ceremony, the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said in her speech that Hong Kong, as an international metropolis where East meets West, requires a large pool of biliterate and trilingual talent to demonstrate its important role as a ""super connector"". This is also crucial to consolidating its status as an international education hub in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. She emphasised that mastering biliteracy and trilingualism is essential for realising Hong Kong's development of the ""eight centres"" as outlined in the National 14th Five-Year Plan, and for seizing opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Under ""one country, two systems"", biliteracy and trilingualism stands as one of the advantages of education in Hong Kong.

She said that over the years, the EDB and SCOLAR have been working together to promote biliteracy and trilingualism. Measures introduced in recent years include encouraging teachers to improve their Putonghua proficiency by utilising the Language Fund to sponsor them to take the Putonghua Proficiency Test. In addition, a one-off grant has been provided to schools for implementing the promotion of self-directed language learning (English and Putonghua) initiative, helping students to enhance their self-directed learning capabilities and biliterate and trilingual skills. It is hoped that, through collective efforts, the Campaign will strengthen Hong Kong's language and talent capital, enabling the city to leverage its advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world.

At the ceremony, the Chairperson of SCOLAR, Dr Anissa Chan, expressed gratitude to the Biliteracy and Trilingualism Campaign 2025 Ambassador, Hins Cheung, and organisations and individuals from various sectors for their support, which contributed to the success of the Campaign. She particularly thanked Hins Cheung and individuals from diverse professional fields for sharing language-learning insights and personal experiences through short videos, illustrating how their biliterate and trilingual abilities have played a crucial role in their personal and career development. She also thanked community partners for organising engaging and meaningful competitions and activities, schools for enthusiastically participating in the One-minute Video Production Competition, and partners from the education sector and various industries for their assistance in producing the videos to promote biliteracy and trilingualism.

Dr Chan pointed out that the Student Language Ambassadors will play a key role in enhancing language proficiency in the community. SCOLAR, in partnership with the EDB, programme partners and key industries, will continue to promote language learning with a view to enhancing the language abilities of Hong Kong citizens.

Awards of the One-minute Video Production Competition were presented at the ceremony. The award-winning works, produced by students, integrated vibrant creative elements, showcasing their proficiency in biliteracy and trilingualism. They effectively promote Hong Kong's position as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange and as an international educational hub.

Community partners, including the Methodist Epworth Village Community Centre Social Welfare, the Smart Education Charitable Foundation and the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, invited winners of their respective activities and competitions to perform or share insights at the ceremony. Their performances were engaging and rich in content. Students demonstrated outstanding language skills and mastery of biliteracy and trilingualism. The vibrant atmosphere infused the ceremony with joy and dynamism, marking a successful conclusion to the Campaign.

The ceremony was held at the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups Building, with around 400 attendees, including guests from the business sector, arts and cultural sector, and community organisations, as well as teachers, parents and students.

​財庫局和證監會就規管數字資產交易及託管服務的立法建議進行諮詢,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700368.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）今日（六月二十七日）就設立數字資產（即諮詢文件內所指的「虛擬資產」）（註）交易和託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議，展開聯合公眾諮詢。公眾諮詢為期兩個月至二○二五年八月二十九日為止。

為保障投資者和管控風險，並同時促進香港數字資產生態圈的可持續發展，政府與金融監管機構一直密切留意市場的發展情況，並與業界緊密溝通，以持續檢視和優化香港對數字資產活動的規管框架。

就此，財庫局在去年二月至四月就數字資產場外交易服務提供者設立發牌制度的立法建議進行公眾諮詢。因應收集到的意見，財庫局聯同證監會調整了立法建議，並藉今日展開的公眾諮詢，就其框架和主要內容收集各持份者的意見。

經調整的立法建議涵蓋數字資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度，以及數字資產託管服務提供者的發牌制度。在擬議的兩個發牌制度下，證監會將擔當標準制訂者，負責制訂適用於持牌和註冊數字資產交易和託管服務提供者的規管要求，而香港金融管理局（金管局）則會擔當前線監管機構，監管已註冊為可提供相關服務的銀行及儲值支付工具。證監會和金管局會獲賦權，以根據法定要求實施該制度。

擬議的發牌制度重點如下：

（一）數字資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度

＊任何人如在香港從事提供數字資產交易服務的業務，須獲證監會發牌或註冊；

＊不論有關的數字資產交易服務是透過實體店及／或其他平台提供，其涵蓋範圍均包括：簡單的交易服務（例如規模較小、涉及不同數字資產之間的兌換服務；以及數字資產與法定貨幣之間的兌換服務），以及較複雜的服務（例如經紀活動、大宗交易活動，以至顧問或資產管理人從事的其他活動）；

＊提供數字資產交易服務的持牌人或註冊人需要符合適當人選的評定準則，以及一系列的規管要求，包括：財政資源、知識和經驗、風險管理、財務匯報和披露、業務操守、資料及通知、備存記錄、妥善保障客戶資產和保障投資者的措施等；及

＊發牌制度將於相關法律條文生效當日全面實施，不設「被當作已獲發牌」的安排。

（二）數字資產託管服務提供者的發牌制度

＊任何人如在香港經營提供數字資產託管服務的業務，須獲證監會發牌或註冊。提供數字資產託管服務的業務的定義是，以業務形式代客戶保管（i）數字資產；或（ii）能轉移客戶數字資產的工具，包括但不限於私人密鑰；及

＊與數字資產交易服務一樣，經營提供數字資產託管服務的業務的持牌人或註冊人需要符合適當人選的評定準則，以及一系列的規管要求，包括：妥善保障客戶資產、財政資源、知識和經驗、風險管理、財務匯報和披露、業務操守、資料及通知，和備存記錄等。同樣，發牌制度會在相關法律條文生效當日全面實施，不設「被當作已獲發牌」的安排。

諮詢文件已上載至財庫局和證監會的網頁：

＊數字資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度（www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/tc/publication/consult/doc/VADEALING_consultation_paper_tc.pdf ／apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/TC/consultation/doc?refNo=25CP6）

財庫局局長許正宇表示：「我們昨日剛發表了《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》，今日隨即便就設立數字資產交易和託管服務提供者發牌制度展開公眾諮詢，正正是要向公眾傳達一個重要的信息，那就是我們在全力建設香港成為全球領先數字資產中心的同時，也必定會為投資者提供充分保障。擬議的發牌制度可為我們提供穩固並以投資者和消費者保障為核心的基礎去構建全面的數字資產規管框架。此舉將貫徹我們致力讓香港的數字資產生態圈在一個風險可控的環境下持續及負責任地蓬勃發展的理念，從而以高巿場可信度為本港的實體經濟和金融巿場帶來實質效益。」

證監會行政總裁梁鳳儀表示：「是次就交易服務和託管服務提供者引入監管制度的建議，將能構建完整的數字資產生態系統，對於機構與零售投資者來說，這系統既安全可靠又活力充沛。為平衡行業發展和穩健的投資者保障，本會與香港特別行政區政府攜手合作，致力將香港打造成一可靠、可持續發展且結合全球流動性的平台。我們亦會與業界持份者竭力保持緊密合作，以擴大市場參與，使香港的市場生態得以更蓬勃地發展。」

財庫局和證監會歡迎公眾及持份者就擬議的發牌制度提供意見，並於二○二五年八月二十九日或以前透過郵遞（香港添馬添美道2號政府總部24樓）或電郵方式將意見送交財庫局：
＊數字資產交易服務提供者的發牌制度：vadealing-consult@fstb.gov.hk
＊數字資產託管服務提供者的發牌制度：vacustody-consult@fstb.gov.hk

財庫局和證監會在諮詢期間也會與相關業界會面，收集意見。

註：「數字資產」一詞包含「虛擬資產」。由於「虛擬資產」一詞在現行的《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》（第615章）中有其法律定義，因此是次公眾諮詢的諮詢文件會沿用「虛擬資產」一詞，但政府將檢視在法例上應否使用其他詞語取代「虛擬資產」以更好反映此資產類別的性質，並與國際市場的理解保持一致。

​教育局和語常會舉行「兩文三語運動2025」閉幕暨頒獎典禮,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700246.htm,"教育局和語文教育及研究常務委員會（語常會）今日（六月二十七日）舉行「兩文三語運動2025」閉幕暨頒獎典禮，總結過去半年攜手在社會各個領域積極加強推展兩文三語活動的豐碩成果。

教育局局長蔡若蓮博士擔任主禮嘉賓，她致辭時表示，香港作為中西薈萃的國際大都會，需要大量掌握良好兩文三語能力的人才，發揮作為超級聯繫人的重要角色，同時鞏固作為亞太區乃至全球的國際教育樞紐的地位。而要落實國家「十四五」規劃中香港發展「八大中心」的定位，抓住「一帶一路」和粵港澳大灣區發展的機遇，也必須掌握好兩文三語。在「一國兩制」之下，兩文三語便成為香港教育的優勢之一。

她表示，教育局和語常會多年來一直攜手推廣兩文三語，近年推出的措施包括透過運用語文基金，資助教師參加普通話水平測試，鼓勵教師提高普通話水平；向學校發放推廣自主學習英語及普通話的一筆過津貼，提升學生自主學習能力及兩文三語水平。期望「兩文三語運動」在大家同心協力下，能增強香港的語言和人才資本，讓香港發揮「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的優勢。

在典禮上，語常會主席陳黃麗娟博士感謝2025年「兩文三語運動大使」張敬軒、各方機構和各界人士的支持，令「兩文三語運動2025」圓滿成功。她特別感謝張敬軒及來自不同界別的人士透過短片分享學習語言的心得與個人經歷，展現兩文三語如何在個人和職業發展中發揮關鍵作用。她亦感謝社區合作夥伴推出既引人入勝又別具意義的比賽和活動、各校積極參與「一分鐘短片製作比賽」，以及教育界和各行各業的合作夥伴在製作兩文三語宣傳短片上的協助。

陳黃麗娟博士指出，學生語文大使將在推動提升社區語言能力方面擔當重要角色。語常會將繼續與教育局、合作夥伴及重點行業攜手推動語言學習，致力提升香港市民的語言能力。

在典禮上，大會頒發了「一分鐘短片製作比賽」的獎項。得獎作品由學生精心製作，融入充滿活力的創意元素，充分展現其兩文三語的能力，並有效推廣香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心和國際教育樞紐的角色。

一眾社區合作夥伴，包括循道愛華村服務中心社會福利部、聰穎教育慈善基金及香港教育工作者聯會，邀請活動優勝者在典禮上表演或分享。有關內容豐富有趣，學生展現了出色的語言能力，充分體現運用兩文三語的精髓，熱烈氣氛為典禮增添喜悅與活力，亦為「兩文三語運動2025」畫上圓滿句號。

閉幕暨頒獎典禮在香港青年協會大廈舉行，約400位來自商界、文化藝術界、社區團體的嘉賓，以及老師、家長和學生出席。有關典禮及「兩文三語運動2025」的詳情，可瀏覽語常會網頁（scolarhk.edb.hkedcity.net/tc/Biliteracy_and_Trilingualism_Campaign），或語常會的社交媒體專頁。"
​衞生防護中心調查一宗與早前群組個案有關連的麻疹個案,2025-06-27 17:30,2025-06-27 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/27/P2025062700631.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（六月二十七日）正調查一宗麻疹個案，並提醒市民接種疫苗是預防麻疹的最有效方法。

個案涉及一名29歲女子，是中心日前公布兩宗有流行病學關連麻疹個案的家人。中心進行接觸者追蹤時，發現早前確診感染麻疹的一名六個月大男嬰的母親約於六月九日出現喉嚨痛，其後並出現咳嗽和短暫發燒，遂安排她到廣華醫院接受檢測。病人的血液樣本經檢測後，證實對麻疹病毒抗體呈陽性反應。她目前已康復。

流行病學調查顯示，女病人未能確定曾否接種麻疹疫苗。中心會繼續調查上述三宗有流行病學關連的麻疹個案，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查未發現這三宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「麻疹的潛伏期（即由感染後到發病的時間）為七至21日。麻疹病徵包括發燒、皮膚出現紅疹、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼紅等。當出現相關病徵，市民應戴上外科口罩，停止上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方和避免與未有免疫力人士接觸，尤其是抵抗力弱人士、孕婦及未滿一歲的兒童。懷疑受感染的人士應盡早向醫生求診及告知醫護人員有麻疹接觸史。」

他續說：「在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下，透過衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院及學童免疫注射小組提供的免疫接種服務，本港整體免疫接種覆蓋率一直維持在非常高水平。根據小學學童的免疫接種覆蓋率及衞生署定期進行全港免疫接種覆蓋調查顯示，兩劑麻疹疫苗接種的整體覆蓋率一直維持在95%以上，而本地麻疹病毒抗體的血清陽性率反映絕大部分香港市民對麻疹已有免疫力。然而，香港作為國際旅遊頻繁的城市，仍面對輸入麻疹病毒及其在本地社區進一步傳播的潛在風險。少數未完成接種麻疹疫苗的人士（例如非本地出生人士，包括新移民、外傭、海外僱員及來港升學人士）仍有機會受感染，並把麻疹傳播給其他未具備麻疹免疫力人士，例如一歲以下尚未接種第一劑麻疹疫苗的幼兒。」

在一九六七年前出生的市民，由於當時麻疹在全球多個地方及香港仍屬風土病，故可視為透過自然感染而對麻疹具備免疫力。一九六七年或以後出生而尚未完成接種兩劑麻疹疫苗或對麻疹疫苗接種史不詳的人士，應盡快諮詢家庭醫生以完成接種，以確保市民對麻疹有足夠保護力。

今年部分海外國家的麻疹個案維持在高水平，其中北美洲（包括美國及加拿大）、歐洲及鄰近地區（包括越南、柬埔寨和菲律賓），因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低而出現麻疹持續爆發。另外，日本和澳洲今年錄得的麻疹個案亦有所上升。因此，計劃前往麻疹流行地區的市民，應及早檢視自己的疫苗接種紀錄及病歷，若以往未經化驗確診感染麻疹，以及從未或不確定曾否接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，應在出發前最少兩星期諮詢醫生接種疫苗。

除接種麻疹疫苗外，市民應採取以下措施預防感染麻疹：

• 維持良好的個人及環境衞生；
•保持室內空氣流通；
•保持雙手清潔，並用正確的方法洗手；
•雙手被呼吸系統分泌物弄污後（如打噴嚏後）應立即洗手；
•打噴嚏或咳嗽時要掩着口鼻，並妥善清理口鼻排出的分泌物；
•徹底清潔用過的玩具和家具；及
•病患者在出疹後的四日內不應上學，避免將疾病傳染給未有免疫力的人。

She particularly thanked Hins Cheung and individuals from diverse professional fields for sharing language-learning insights and personal experiences through short videos, illustrating how their biliterate and trilingual abilities have played a crucial role in their personal and career development. She also thanked community partners for organising engaging and meaningful competitions and activities, schools for enthusiastically participating in the One-minute Video Production Competition, and partners from the education sector and various industries for their assistance in producing the videos to promote biliteracy and trilingualism.

Dr Chan pointed out that the Student Language Ambassadors will play a key role in enhancing language proficiency in the community. SCOLAR, in partnership with the EDB, programme partners and key industries, will continue to promote language learning with a view to enhancing the language abilities of Hong Kong citizens.

Awards of the One-minute Video Production Competition were presented at the ceremony. The award-winning works, produced by students, integrated vibrant creative elements, showcasing their proficiency in biliteracy and trilingualism. They effectively promote Hong Kong's position as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange and as an international educational hub.

Community partners, including the Methodist Epworth Village Community Centre Social Welfare, the Smart Education Charitable Foundation and the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, invited winners of their respective activities and competitions to perform or share insights at the ceremony. Their performances were engaging and rich in content. Students demonstrated outstanding language skills and mastery of biliteracy and trilingualism. The vibrant atmosphere infused the ceremony with joy and dynamism, marking a successful conclusion to the Campaign.

The ceremony was held at the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups Building, with around 400 attendees, including guests from the business sector, arts and cultural sector, and community organisations, as well as teachers, parents and students.
