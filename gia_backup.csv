FEHD orders two fresh provision shops in Mong Kok to suspend business for 14 days,2026-02-19 15:00,2026-02-19 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/19/P2026021200348.htm,"  The Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene has ordered two fresh provision shops in Mong Kok to suspend business for 14 days, as the licensees repeatedly breached the Food Business Regulation (FBR) by extending their business areas illegally.

  The two shops, located at Shop 30 and Shop 29 on the ground floor at 15-19 Cheung Wong Road respectively, were ordered to suspend business from today (February 19) to March 4.

  ""Two convictions for the above-mentioned breach were recorded against the shop licensee of Shop 30 in November last year. A total fine of $5,200 was levied by the court, and 30 demerit points were registered against the licensee under the department's demerit points system. While in September and November last year, two convictions for the above-mentioned breach were recorded against the shop licensee of Shop 29. A total fine of $5,000 was levied by the court, and 30 demerit points were registered against this licensee under the department's demerit points system. The contraventions resulted in the 14-day licence suspension for these two shops,"" a spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said.

  The licensee of Shop 30 had a record of two convictions for the same offence in July last year. A total fine of $6,000 was levied, and 30 demerit points were also registered. While in October 2024 and April last year, the licensee of Shop 29 had a record of two convictions for the same offence. A total fine of $4,500 was levied, and 30 demerit points were also registered. The breaches led to business suspensions of both shops for seven days during last September and June respectively.

  The spokesman reminded licensees of food premises to comply with the FBR, or their licences could be suspended or cancelled.

  Licensed food premises are required to exhibit their licence and a sign at a conspicuous place of the premises, indicating that the premises are licensed. A list of licensed food premises is available on the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/licensing/licence-foodPremises-search.html)."

Ladies and gentlemen, good evening, and welcome to Hong Kong's Chinese New Year Fireworks display.

Tonight's spectacular fireworks show, bursting with symbolic Chinese New Year images, will light up Victoria Harbour for 23 thrilling minutes.

The fireworks' thundering sound will also echo the spirit of the Year of the Horse, now in its second auspicious day.

It's a sound that captures the essence of what we say in Chinese: 萬馬奔騰 – literally, ""ten thousand horses galloping forward"" – a powerful image of energy, momentum, and shared progress.

My thanks to the Hong Kong Jockey Club for sponsoring tonight's fireworks extravaganza.

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-18 17:30,2026-02-18 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/18/P2026021800366.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 18), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.
	

The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

​
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-18 17:30,2026-02-18 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/18/P2026021800364.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月十八日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球正值冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
