Government undertakes comprehensive follow-up on Tai Po fire (with photos/video),2025-11-27 23:59,2025-11-28 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700980.htm,"âA Government spokesman said today (November 27) that, in view of the No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po that has caused multiple casualties, the Chief Executive convened another cross-departmental meeting this morning to co-ordinate all policy bureaux and departments, actively advancing the response efforts in four key areas: extinguishing the fire and rescuing trapped residents, treating the injured, providing post-incident support, and conducting a comprehensive investigation.

  In terms of rescue efforts, among the eight buildings in Wang Fuk Court, the fires in seven affected blocks are largely under control. The Fire Services Department (FSD) is continuing its full effort to complete the search and rescue and firefighting operations on the remaining floors. During the fire, the FSD received 346 requests for assistance and has handled 296 of them.

  On medical support, the Primary Healthcare Commission co-ordinated professionals from the public and private medical sectors, including over 250 doctors and more than 250 other healthcare professionals from the private sector, to set up medical stations at all temporary shelters. The medical stations provide appropriate medical assistance for residents in need from 8am to 8pm daily, including basic medical assessments and referral services, treatment of mild injuries, drug prescriptions (including necessary medication refills based on one's medical history), and psychological support, with a view to assisting in managing non-emergency medical needs.

  As for post-incident support, the Chief Executive has instructed the Civil Service Bureau to activate the ""Government-wide Mobilisation"" mechanism to ensure sufficient manpower for all necessary follow-up actions. Meanwhile, all government-organised celebratory events will be cancelled or postponed, and officials will reduce attendance at non-essential public activities to focus on relief and recovery efforts. The Government will arrange memorial activities, including flying flags at half-mast at government buildings, holding memorial services and setting up condolence books to allow the public to express their sorrow and condolences. Further details will be announced later.

  To meet the short- and medium-term accommodation needs of affected residents, the Government has opened nine shelters, which are currently being used by over 500 residents. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau has contacted youth hostels and hotels, which will provide around 1 000 units for affected residents to stay in immediately for one to two weeks. The Government is also co-ordinating resources for transitional housing and dedicated rehousing units from the Hong Kong Housing Society, with an estimated 1 800 units to be made available later to meet the accommodation needs of the affected residents.

  In addition, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) has mobilised social workers, clinical psychologists and support staff to provide ""one social worker per household"" assistance to affected residents, including emotional support, financial assistance, and residential care and occasional child care services. The SWD will maintain close liaison with relevant government departments to provide all necessary assistance to those affected.

  The Education Bureau (EDB) immediately contacted the school heads associations in Tai Po and schools near Wang Fuk Court to co-ordinate class suspension arrangements for the affected schools. It also deployed staff to the temporary shelters to provide emotional support for affected students. The EDB will maintain close communication with the school heads associations and schools in the district, and continue to provide them with necessary assistance and support services.

  Starting tonight, the Government will provide an emergency cash subsidy of HK$10,000 to each affected household to offer immediate relief. At the same time, the Government has established the ""Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po"", allocating HK$300 million as start-up capital to assist residents and support all relevant work. The fund began accepting donations from 7pm this evening. Its designated bank accounts at the Bank of China (Hong Kong) are: HKD donation account 012-875-2-190159-7 and foreign-currency donation account 012-875-2-190160-7, enabling contributions from all sectors of the community to support the victims.

  As for funeral arrangements for the deceased, if affected residents require cremation services or columbarium niches, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department will make special arrangements and provide full support.

  Regarding investigations, Police arrested two male directors and a male engineering consultant of a construction company in the small hours today. They are being detained for further enquiries. Police have also seized for further inspection materials at the scene that may not have met regulatory standards. Once the fire is extinguished and on-site safety is confirmed, Police will co-ordinate with the FSD to gather evidence and conduct a thorough investigation to ascertain the cause of the fire.

  Separately, the Buildings Department (BD) and the Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau today issued a letter to all registered building professionals and registered contractors requiring them to review relevant records or test certificates relating to fire retardant properties of the protective nets and the like used in scaffolds for ongoing projects (buildings under construction or existing buildings under maintenance). They must submit a report to the BD within seven days, after which the BD will conduct audit checks. At the same time, the Architectural Services Department (ArchSD) has required contractors of building projects under public works contracts to review and submit the above-mentioned information within seven days. The ArchSD will also conduct audit checks.

  The BD also launched today a special operation to inspect in batches all existing buildings that are currently undergoing external wall renovations with scaffolding and protective nets. The BD will proactively check the records or test certificates relating to fire retardant properties of the protective nets and the like used in scaffolds, and collect samples for testing. Regarding sample testing, the Government is also appealing for assistance from the Mainland to enhance testing capacity.

  The registered contractor responsible for the maintenance works at Wang Fuk Court is currently involved in 11 other private residential building projects. The BD inspected the relevant sites today and will take any appropriate follow-up action.

  In addition, the Development Bureau (DEVB) today met with the industry to discuss the roadmap for advancing the replacement of bamboo scaffolding with metal scaffolding. At the meeting, the DEVB also requested the industry's co-operation with the above-mentioned inspection and audit checks. The BD will review the relevant requirements, guidelines and legislation regulating the erection of scaffolding (whether metal or bamboo) and associated protective nets, and will consider whether there is a need for strengthening or enhancement.

  As at 8pm today, the No. 5 alarm fire in Tai Po has resulted in 65 deaths and 77 injuries, including one fireman among the deceased. To better co-ordinate the follow-up actions, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has established three working groups, namely an inspection and regulatory working group led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, an emergency assistance and fundraising group led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, and an emergency residential arrangement working group led by the Deputy Financial Secretary, and has been actively taking forward the relevant work."
SDEV meets with construction industry on special inspections and regulatory review,2025-11-27 23:59,2025-11-28 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700986.htm,"The No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po has caused multiple casualties and the relevant departments are conducting a comprehensive investigation. The Development Bureau (DEVB), together with the Buildings Department (BD), met with the construction industry today (November 27) to discuss the follow-up actions related to the sector.

Chaired by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, the meeting was attended by representatives from the Construction Industry Council, contractors' associations, subcontractors' associations, trade contractors' associations, and labour unions. Ms Linn explained the follow-up inspections by the relevant departments (Notes) and requested the industry to cooperate.

Ms Linn also noted that the BD will review the requirements, guidelines, and regulations concerning scaffolding and protective nets, and will listen to the views of the industry.

Ms Linn further said that although the tragedy is suspected to have been caused by non-compliance from some industry practitioners rather than the use of bamboo scaffolds, bamboo scaffolds are indeed less fire-resistant than metal scaffolds. While the use of bamboo scaffolds has a long history in Hong Kong and offers more flexibility in adapting to certain narrow streets and building environments compared to metal scaffolds, the Government considers it necessary to develop a roadmap to switch to metal scaffolds as soon as possible under suitable worksite conditions. This aims to reassure the public and to provide better safeguards for construction safety. Industry representatives expressed understanding and support, agreeing to formulate an action plan with a clear direction that is not ""one-size-fits-all"". The next step is to identify work scenarios most suitable for switching to metal scaffolds (for example, new building projects and maintenance works at existing buildings along wider streets), followed by setting an ambitious roadmap for projects fitting those scenarios to switch to metal scaffolds. In formulating the roadmap, three factors should be taken into account, namely, the capacity of bamboo scaffolders and specialist contractors during the transition; the need for a stable source and sufficient supply of metal scaffolds to ensure adequacy; and the arrangements for transportation and storage of metal scaffolds.

Ms Linn said that the Government will consider providing assistance to the industry in terms of training and other resources during the process. The DEVB will put forward a proposal as soon as possible, based on the aforementioned consensus, for further discussion with the industry.

Notes:

The BD and the Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau (HB) today launched a special operation, issuing circular letters to registered building professionals and contractors. They are required to review the records or test documents for materials, such as scaffolds protective nets, used in ongoing projects, regardless of whether the buildings are under construction or are existing ones under maintenance. The review should include an assessment of the condition of the materials and their compliance with the standards and requirements for fire retardant performance. A report must be submitted to the BD within seven days, after which the BD will conduct audit checks. Meanwhile, the Architectural Services Department (ArchSD) has required contractors of building projects under public works contracts to review and submit the above-mentioned information within seven days. The ArchSD will also conduct audit checks.
	
The BD and the ICU of the HB, with the latter responsible for Home Ownership Scheme courts, today launched a special operation targeting existing buildings undergoing major external wall maintenance, where scaffolds protective nets were erected. Inspections will be conducted in batches for all such projects to proactively check records or relevant test documents for materials such as scaffolding protective nets regarding their fire retardant performance. Samples will also be collected for testing.

Labour Department launches special enforcement operation targeting fire safety in construction sites,2025-11-27 22:58,2025-11-27 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700949.htm,"âThe Labour Department (LD)'s spokesman today (November 27) said that the department is highly concerned about the No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po, yesterday (November 26). The LD is saddened that the fire has caused multiple casualties and expresses its deepest sympathies to the victims' families and the injured persons.

  The LD will launch a two-week territory-wide special enforcement operation tomorrow, targeting the fire protection facilities and fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. This includes checking if protective screens (also known as scaffold nets) are in compliance with recognised standards for fire-retardant materials to ensure work safety. Meanwhile, the LD will also work with the Buildings Department to inspect buildings undergoing major external wall repairs with large-scale bamboo scaffolds erected so as to ensure that scaffold nets installed on the scaffolds comply with the requirements of relevant Code of Practice/Guidance Notes.

  If any violations of the legislation are detected during the inspection exercise, occupational safety officers of the LD will take rigorous enforcement actions, including issuing suspension notices and improvement notices, and taking out prosecutions without prior warning, in order to deter unsafe operations.

Due to the recent dry weather, the LD strongly urges and warns all contractors that they should take notice of the fire risk of the site, particularly the need to enhance the fire safety of the bamboo scaffold, to ensure relevant materials are in compliance with the fire safety standards and clear up the debris regularly; smoking at site areas is strictly prohibited. While conducting hot work processes (such as welding and flame-cutting which may produce sparks), the safety measures devised from relevant risk assessment should be strictly followed, and sufficient and effective firefighting equipment should be in place. Contractors should further step up fire safety management to prevent fire incidents, ensure the safety of construction sites and workers and avoid recurrence of yesterday's tragic fire in Tai Po .

The LD also appeals to employers to be considerate to employees who are unable to work as usual due to the impact of the Tai Po fire, and to provide flexible work arrangements wherever possible to help them through this difficult period. Employers and employees may call the dedicated hotline 2929 4054 in case of enquiries on employment-related matters."
發展局局長就特別巡查及制度檢視工作與業界會面,2025-11-27 22:25,2025-11-27 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700926.htm,"大埔宏福苑五級大火導致多人傷亡，相關部門正進行全面調查。發展局聯同屋宇署今日（十一月二十七日）與建造業界會面，商討與業界相關的跟進工作。

會議由發展局局長甯漢豪主持，與會者包括建造業議會、承建商商會、分包商商會、行業承造商會及工會代表。甯漢豪向他們闡述有關部門的跟進巡查工作（註），要求業界積極配合。

甯漢豪亦向他們表示，屋宇署會檢視棚架及相關保護網等裝置的要求、指引及法規，並聽取業界的意見。

另外，甯漢豪表示，雖然今次慘劇懷疑是業內有違規行為而造成，而並非純粹因為使用竹棚架，但竹棚的耐燃性始終不及金屬棚架，縱然使用竹棚架在香港有長久歷史，相對金屬棚架亦可較靈活配合某些狹窄街道及樓宇環境，為令社會安心及為建造業安全施工提供更好的保障，政府認為應該擬定路線圖，以便在合適工地環境下盡快改用金屬棚架。與會業界代表均對此方向表示理解及支持，同意製定「非一刀切」但方向清晰的行動綱領，包括下一步工作需要識別何種工作情景比較適合轉用金屬棚架（例如新建樓宇及位處街道比較寬闊的現樓維修），接着為符合該等情景的工程項目轉用金屬棚架訂定一個比較進取的路線圖，並在擬定路線圖時考慮以下三個要素：竹棚工人和竹棚專門承建商在轉型過程中的承受能力、金屬棚架的來源要有穩定供應，確保供應充裕、金屬棚架的運輸和儲存安排。

甯漢豪表示，政府在過程中會研究在培訓和其他資源方面向業界提供協助。發展局會根據上述共識盡快提出方案，並與業界進一步商討。

This platform will allow relevant organisations and members of the public to register the items they can donate, enabling the Government to better consolidate the information and distribute the supplies to residents in need when necessary. The platform is expected to be completed within the coming days. At this stage, organisations and members of the public can register their details and the supplies they can donate via WhatsApp at 9213 2388, so that the Government can consolidate the information and contact the relevant parties when needed."

記者：特首你好。希望這場火能盡快撲熄，但我們要面對這件事。今日勞工處最新回覆傳媒，確認其實去年已收到宏福苑居民投訴有關棚網的防火問題，最近一次是在十一月二十日做過一次巡查，也只發出書面提醒。經歷了那麼長時間，有居民發現到問題，但是為甚麼不執法、不即時處理呢？居民也很想問，這次是否一宗人禍？會否有官員或公務員需要問責下台？謝謝。

行政長官：我成立三個工作組，其中一個工作組就是針對調查和規管的工作。我亦委派了政務司司長去督導所有的工作。我們有兩方面要主力聚焦。第一，這事件發生了，有哪些行為需要負責。警務處的調查已經由刑事方向展開。另外，在規管制度方面，我們怎樣可以更加強化，有沒有法例需要修訂；整個規管系統，怎樣可以確保將來這些不幸事件不再發生，這些就是工作組會全面推行的。我亦會審視所有過去有關這方面所提出的一些要求和問題。每一項都由這個工作組全面去跟進。但是，我們在這方面要實事求是，以科學為本，特別是我們針對不同物料的要求。一般來說，我們的要求都是符合國際標準的，但是有哪些地方可以強化，而且我們有監管制度、巡查制度、審批制度、驗證制度等等，工作組就要循這方向進行工作。

記者：剛才特首未有提到關於選舉的安排，現在會否延期？根據立法會的條例，最多只能延長十四日。會否延期多過十四日，或好像二○二○年般動用緊急法呢？

行政長官：有關選舉工程，我們已經暫停了。我今早在醫院向大家說，首要的任務就是要做好今次我們的應急和救援工作。我們會在第一階段的統籌工作完成後，全面審視整個情況，決定選舉是繼續怎樣進行。

記者：你好。請問港澳辦工作小組赴港協助開展救助工作，請問含義為何？會負責甚麼角色？會否反映特區政府在工作上有些不足？謝謝。

行政長官：第一，習近平主席高度關心這件事，我非常多謝習主席。我們國家「一方有難、八方支援」這精神，我相信無論在國內或香港，都是全面體會。過去發生了這場大火後，見到香港市民亦是「一方有難、八方支援」，大家都想多做一點，盡量將我們的傷痛時間縮短，將我們的傷亡情況減低，將我們的痛苦盡快撫平，我想大家都是本着這個心。

在習主席的高度重視和關心下，不同單位都很熱烈地支持香港特區的救援工作。中央港澳辦派了工作組來支援香港的救援工作，正正就是出於大家希望盡快將我們的救援工作完成。社會共渡時艱，化悲痛為建設香港的力量，我們是希望盡快復原。

亦因為這樣，我們一向以來建立了大灣區應急行動機制。這次不同鄰近城市的領導，自從發生火災後，都發了很多訊息，表示支持，亦表示任何我們需要的援助，他們都會提供。我們亦多謝不同的內地無論是省、市等單位，表示了他們在這方面的關心和支持。

我們一向在大灣區應急行動機制裏，有一些儀器、工具或化驗的協作，所以我們覺得這次是很好的資源讓我們可以運用。我們亦都制訂了一份清單，而這清單我們都覺得是實事求是。雖然就算沒有這些工具或資源，我們都會做好這件事，但我覺得將其效率和時間，盡量加速加快，確保能夠盡快共渡時艱，這亦展現了我們的積極性，以及盡快為大家撫平傷痛。本着大愛精神、本着大家有艱難的時候一起施以援手，我覺得這是我們很偉大的關愛精神的展現。

記者：想問因為屋宇署有關阻燃保護網的指引其實一直都存在，剛剛特首說會即時進行一個全港的巡查。其實過去屋宇署有否做定期的巡查？例如今次宏福苑那麼大型的工程，有沒有事前去巡查過？還是沒事發生就不會巡查？這次算不算後知後覺？有關剛剛調查的問題，會否包括政府部門的人員？例如剛剛有記者提到，曾經接獲投訴的勞工處相關的負責人會否都是調查的對象？

行政長官：我們在工程方面，無論是地盤安全、用料安全、管理安全方面，都有一個系統和機制，亦有不同的措施去規管和強化。香港工程數量很多，所以在不同方面會用多元化的的規管方法。有些我們要求專業人士履行其專業責任，對於某些工作，他去承擔責任，負起規則訂立、標準訂立和實際操作的一些要求。他作為一個專業人員負這個責任，我們在一些管理方面的機制，會發揮專業人士的作用。我當然期望，也要求專業人士履行好我們給予其重要的社會責任。但是如果履行不佳，我們當然要追究責任，也有巡查機制，按着不同方面的一些工程作出巡查，但是涉及的環節那麼多，我們在整體的監管機制裏要如何強化？當然，現在就是成立工作小組，它需要系統化地審視多種工程涉及的不同工業安全元素，我們都是系統化地進行研究工作及跟進工作。這些肯定會納入工作小組。過去巡查的工作不斷進行，但是哪些環節要增加、哪些環節要強化、哪些抽查要再增加資源？這些工作小組都會一一研究。多謝大家。

記者：特首，想問每次都是最後才多謝消防，是否不重視他們的付出？

行政長官：我想講清楚，我是非常感謝所有參與這次救援工作的人士、所有官員。當然消防處的同事是不眠不休，全力以赴，大家都看到，我與處長亦有不斷接觸和溝通，很明確表示可以動用所有資源給予消防處的工作，配合他們盡快完成任務。我今日到現場考察時，亦衷心感謝所有人士，包括消防同事和現場參與工作的人士。公務員在現時不同崗位正參與不同的工作，每一位都是全心盡力，在如此艱難的時候，大家同心做好這件事，令我們可以盡快過渡這個艱難時期。我亦多次感謝社會人士，無論是義工或供應物資，或將他們所知道的一些困難個案，轉告有關部門。

在一個這麼艱難的時候，當然有問題提出，我們亦要認真解決，因此我成立工作組，系統性處理因時間關係可能已經累積的問題，我們更要強化。在這方面，三個工作組任重道遠，我亦希望大家共同團結一致，將我們的悲痛轉化為建設的力量，大家令社會可以正常運作、令社會可以早日復原。多謝大家。"

行政長官就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（二）（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-11-27 21:02,2025-11-27 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700791.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（十一月二十七日）聯同政務司司長陳國基、政務司副司長卓永興、財政司副司長黃偉綸、保安局局長鄧炳強、民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟、勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡和消防處處長楊恩健，就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的開場發言：

政務司司長：謝謝行政長官。

按行政長官指示，我會主持一個調查及規管工作組，處理火災後的調查及規管巡查工作。我們一方面透過全面調查，包括警方的刑事調查，以及房屋局獨立審查組就建築物外牆保護材料是否符合認可阻燃標準進行調查，徹底查出火警起因，並且依法、依規追究責任。調查結果會按階段公布。

另一方面，我們透過巡查、規管工作，盡快排除隱患，確保全港所有正在進行大型維修的屋苑的棚架及建築物料安全，亦可以令現在居住於這些屋苑的居民，以及他們的家人安心。

我現在會向各位簡介相關工作。

在調查工作方面，警方已經以涉嫌誤殺罪拘捕三名男子，並大規模搜查三名被捕人的住所及公司，檢走大量與案件有關的證據，包括招標文件、僱員名單，以及14台電腦和三人的手機作進一步調查。警方亦於火警現場檢走懷疑不合標準的發泡膠板等證物作進一步檢驗。

當火警撲滅及現場環境安全後，警方將聯同消防人員進入現場搜證，並大規模檢視現場一帶的閉路電視以搜集證據。

在規管巡查方面，屋宇署及房屋局獨立審查組，以及建築署，今日已啓動特別行動，就正在進行中的工程，無論是興建新樓宇或是現樓維修，要求註冊建築專業人士及承建商，覆檢棚架保護網等物料的紀錄和測試文件，包括狀況是否良好，是否符合阻燃性能的標準和要求，一定要在七日內向部門提交報告。初步估計涉及數以百計的個案。部門會抽查個案，並抽取樣本進行測試。

就正進行外牆維修，而有棚架保護網的樓宇，屋宇署今日已啓動特別行動，分批巡查全部涉及私人樓宇的項目，主動檢查棚架保護網等物料的阻燃性能紀錄及相關測試文件，同樣會抽取樣本進行測試。

對於另外四個正在進行外牆維修的居屋屋苑，房屋局審查組亦已經在今日緊急分派多組專業人員隊伍，到現場視察外牆棚架並採樣測試，確保承辦商所採用的棚架保護網合乎相關規定。

在樣本測試方面，政府亦正尋求內地協助，以增加測試容量，加快進度。

負責宏福苑維修的註冊承建商，現時涉及另外11項私樓工程，屋宇署今日會巡查有關地盤，要求提交阻燃性能的測試文件，並抽樣進行測試，以及視察現場有否不恰當的作業情況，並作適當跟進行動。

發展局今日已經與業界會面，商討推進金屬棚架取代竹棚架的路線圖。雖然使用竹棚架在香港有長久歷史，相對金屬棚架亦可較靈活配合狹窄街道環境，好像比較方便一些，但竹棚架在耐燃方面始終不及金屬棚架。為安全起見，政府認為應該盡快在合適工地環境下全面改用金屬棚架，並為此與業界一起作好準備，多些討論和研究，包括培訓工人及協助轉型。局方亦在會面中要求業界配合上述的巡查和覆檢工作。

屋宇署亦會檢視搭建棚架，無論金屬棚或竹棚，及相關保護網的要求、指引及法例規管，考慮是否有需要加強或優化目前的規管。

另外，我們衷心感謝中央和鄰近大灣區城市的支持。特區政府已根據資源共享機制，尋求內地支援，以強化火警調查和火災的善後工作。

我們非常感謝廣東消防救援總隊及深圳市消防支隊，借用八架配備熱成像功能的勘察無人機及能提供長期供電的兩架無人機，這些裝備有效幫助消防處加強火災現場勘察和緊急調派的工作。

我們會進一步聯繫內地機關尋求提供可以幫助我們搬運證物的裝置，正如剛才行政長官提及，例如外骨架助力器，有助消防人員負重上樓梯；和機械化運輸帶等。我們亦會統籌醫衞局（醫務衞生局）所需的醫療物資，包括專門解毒劑和嚴重燒傷專用的醫療耗材，以及發展局在盡量增加樣本測試容量方面，希望內地提供我們所需的協助。

我的匯報到這裏為止。謝謝大家。

政務司副司長：以下我會講講緊急支援及募捐工作組的相關措施。

第一，社會福利署（社署）會採取「一戶一社工」的措施，安排每戶一名專業社工，全程照顧及跟進，為居民安排所需福利，並與其他部門及單位協調，陪伴住戶度過艱難時刻。社署社工其實從昨日起已一直在現場聯絡受影響住戶，如住戶有需要，亦可主動聯絡社署職員。

第二，火災後，居民大多身無長物，需要一些緊急的金錢去應急，支付必需的日常開支，以解燃眉之急。就此，政府會向每一個受影響住戶派發一萬元的應急錢，我們預備了現金今日優先發放給在各庇護中心暫住的宏福苑居民。各庇護中心和大埔民政諮詢服務中心亦會接受其他宏福苑居民的應急錢申請，盡快發放。此外，我們正想方設法為災民提供公共交通優惠，方便出行，事成便會盡快公布。

第三，如行政長官剛才所言，政府已成立「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，我們投入了三億元作為起動資金，協助居民及支持各項相關工作。支援基金在今晚七時起開始接受個人及機構的捐款，港元捐款是中銀香港戶口號碼是012-875-2-190159-7及其他貨幣捐款戶口號碼是012-875-2-190160-7。

在物資捐贈方面，目前我們已經收到很多捐贈，物資基本充足。如果我們仍要社會捐贈，我們會作出宣布。

第四，今次重大事故導致大量人命傷亡，如果災民在殯葬上對火化服務及骨灰龕位有要求，食物環境衞生署會加速處理、全力配合。

最後，行政長官已經指示公務員事務局啓動「全政府動員」機制。所有政策局及部門需要安排足夠人手，隨時為需要額外人手的行動提供支援。例如，當災場解封時，政府會動員公務員，協助重返家園的災民，進行清理、收拾等工作。

我的簡報完畢。

財政司副司長：政府明白受火災影響的居民，在應急住宿上，有非常迫切的需要，行政長官指示成立應急住宿安排工作組，由我擔任組長，成員包括民青局（民政及青年事務局）、房屋局、發展局及勞福局（勞工及福利局）等的局長。小組目前的工作主要有兩方面。

第一，社署社工會聯絡不同住戶，了解他們的情況和需要。作為一個即時的緩衝安排，透過民青局同事的努力，政府已經物色到接近1 000個單位，這些單位位於不同的青年宿舍或酒店之內，可以讓受影響居民留宿起碼一至兩個星期。社署社工會盡快安排相關居民入住。這些青年宿舍和酒店在香港不同地區，以青年宿舍來說，例如有位於深水埗的南昌匯、位於元朗的保良局李兆基青年綠洲、位於啟德的啟航1331等；而酒店方面就包括屯門黃金海岸酒店、香港富麗敦海洋公園酒店、沙田帝逸酒店、灣仔木棉花酒店、荃灣如心酒店等。我知道酒店數目正在增加中，大家都想幫手。詳情民青局稍後會提供進一步的訊息。

關於後續的過渡安排，主要以政府的過渡性房屋，以及房協（香港房屋協會）的專用安置屋邨單位為主，我們估計初步合共可提供接近1 800個單位。這些單位有水電，可供煮食，單位內亦有淋浴設施。這些單位亦位於香港不同地區，包括大埔、葵青、元朗、柴灣、黃大仙、深水埗等等。社署社工會聯絡受影響住戶，按個別的需要及情況，作適當的入住安排。詳情房屋局稍後會有公布。我的匯報到這裏為止。

行政長官：接下來我請勞福局局長和民青局局長，向大家講解一下他們在各自範疇推進的工作，我亦請了保安局局長和消防處處長來此，如果大家有關於這些方面的問題提出，他們都可以回答。我首先請勞福局局長。

勞工及福利局局長：各位，除了剛提到會安排「一戶一社工」去跟進外，我們在現場留意到有體弱的長者，以及殘疾人士，我們已按他們的需要和意願安排暫託。至於年輕人和小孩，我們亦利用了於大埔的資源為他們提供託管安排，確保他們得到良好照顧。在醫院方面，醫務社工亦會為家屬提供一切可行的支援。此外，整個社福界都已經聯合動起來，會動用社福界所有資源，為有需要的災民提供各式各樣的社福支持。

民政及青年事務局局長：我先簡介各方面的工作，首先是庇護中心，剛才行政長官提及現時仍有九個庇護中心開放，這些庇護中心會開放至居民的臨時問題可以得到解決為止。在庇護中心開放期間，18區的關愛隊會輪流當值協助居民，尤其剛才政務司副司長和行政長官也提及，很多市民在火警逃生時可能沒有帶錢，或甚麼也沒有帶，他們需要一些應急錢，所以政府會為每個受影響的宏福苑住戶提供一萬元應急錢，今晚稍後我們便可為現時已登記入住庇護中心的住戶，提供每戶一萬元現金。其他未登記入住庇護中心的住戶，可以在明日或今晚稍後時間到庇護中心登記，我們會盡快發放每戶一萬元的應急錢給大家，希望在大家徬徨時，能有點錢傍身幫忙。

剛才行政長官也提及，政府會成立「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，行政長官決定投放三億元作為起始基金。在過去這段日子，我們一直都收到很多商界或不同界別的朋友，表示他們想資助或捐助，我們得到中銀（香港）的幫忙，今天馬上開了一個戶口。剛才行政長官也提到戶口號碼，我再說一次：中銀（香港），戶口號碼是012-875-2-190159-7。今晚七時，很快就可以接受捐款，如果大家想支持我們，幫助居民，大家可以捐款到這戶口。

另外，現時在各個庇護中心，我們都很感謝大家，很熱心地捐出不同物資，現時的物資都已足夠應付。我們知道大家想繼續幫忙，現在也有一些科技界朋友，希望可以創立平台供大家登記，稍後如果我們透過這些科技界朋友設計到一個平台，便可以供大家登記，但在這段時間，我想庇護中心需要先處理大家早前捐出的物資，我們希望可以有序地去安排物資。

在過去一日，我們透過不同的私營機構和慈善團體物色到1 000個房間，包括青年宿舍和在啟德的青年驛站。我們知道在網上有很多朋友說要開放青年驛站，開放啟德，甚至表示要幫忙做義工。這些工作我們已經準備好，很多謝大家的幫忙和熱心，但正如剛才孫局長所說的，我們會有「一戶一社工」，透過社工協助這些住戶搬入臨時住宿，而長遠亦有社工跟進他們的住屋和其他的福利需要。

少數族裔關愛隊也到各個庇護中心，了解是否有少數族裔市民有需要，我們暫時還沒有看到。我們暫時有這些報告，在接下來的日子，民青局和民政署的團隊一定會緊守崗位，協助我們大埔宏福苑的居民，渡過這個艱難的時間，也希望所有市民能夠繼續支持和配合我們各方面的工作，多謝大家對受影響居民的關心和支持。"
行政長官就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（二）（只有中文）,2025-11-27 21:02,2025-11-27 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700791.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（十一月二十七日）聯同政務司司長陳國基、政務司副司長卓永興、財政司副司長黃偉綸、保安局局長鄧炳強、民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟、勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡和消防處處長楊恩健，就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的開場發言：

政務司司長：謝謝行政長官。

按行政長官指示，我會主持一個調查及規管工作組，處理火災後的調查及規管巡查工作。我們一方面透過全面調查，包括警方的刑事調查，以及房屋局獨立審查組就建築物外牆保護材料是否符合認可阻燃標準進行調查，徹底查出火警起因，並且依法、依規追究責任。調查結果會按階段公布。

另一方面，我們透過巡查、規管工作，盡快排除隱患，確保全港所有正在進行大型維修的屋苑的棚架及建築物料安全，亦可以令現在居住於這些屋苑的居民，以及他們的家人安心。

我現在會向各位簡介相關工作。

在調查工作方面，警方已經以涉嫌誤殺罪拘捕三名男子，並大規模搜查三名被捕人的住所及公司，檢走大量與案件有關的證據，包括招標文件、僱員名單，以及14台電腦和三人的手機作進一步調查。警方亦於火警現場檢走懷疑不合標準的發泡膠板等證物作進一步檢驗。

當火警撲滅及現場環境安全後，警方將聯同消防人員進入現場搜證，並大規模檢視現場一帶的閉路電視以搜集證據。

在規管巡查方面，屋宇署及房屋局獨立審查組，以及建築署，今日已啓動特別行動，就正在進行中的工程，無論是興建新樓宇或是現樓維修，要求註冊建築專業人士及承建商，覆檢棚架保護網等物料的紀錄和測試文件，包括狀況是否良好，是否符合阻燃性能的標準和要求，一定要在七日內向部門提交報告。初步估計涉及數以百計的個案。部門會抽查個案，並抽取樣本進行測試。

就正進行外牆維修，而有棚架保護網的樓宇，屋宇署今日已啓動特別行動，分批巡查全部涉及私人樓宇的項目，主動檢查棚架保護網等物料的阻燃性能紀錄及相關測試文件，同樣會抽取樣本進行測試。

對於另外四個正在進行外牆維修的居屋屋苑，房屋局審查組亦已經在今日緊急分派多組專業人員隊伍，到現場視察外牆棚架並採樣測試，確保承辦商所採用的棚架保護網合乎相關規定。

在樣本測試方面，政府亦正尋求內地協助，以增加測試容量，加快進度。

負責宏福苑維修的註冊承建商，現時涉及另外11項私樓工程，屋宇署今日會巡查有關地盤，要求提交阻燃性能的測試文件，並抽樣進行測試，以及視察現場有否不恰當的作業情況，並作適當跟進行動。

發展局今日已經與業界會面，商討推進金屬棚架取代竹棚架的路線圖。雖然使用竹棚架在香港有長久歷史，相對金屬棚架亦可較靈活配合狹窄街道環境，好像比較方便一些，但竹棚架在耐燃方面始終不及金屬棚架。為安全起見，政府認為應該盡快在合適工地環境下全面改用金屬棚架，並為此與業界一起作好準備，多些討論和研究，包括培訓工人及協助轉型。局方亦在會面中要求業界配合上述的巡查和覆檢工作。

屋宇署亦會檢視搭建棚架，無論金屬棚或竹棚，及相關保護網的要求、指引及法例規管，考慮是否有需要加強或優化目前的規管。

另外，我們衷心感謝中央和鄰近大灣區城市的支持。特區政府已根據資源共享機制，尋求內地支援，以強化火警調查和火災的善後工作。

我們非常感謝廣東消防救援總隊及深圳市消防支隊，借用八架配備熱成像功能的勘察無人機及能提供長期供電的兩架無人機，這些裝備有效幫助消防處加強火災現場勘察和緊急調派的工作。

我們會進一步聯繫內地機關尋求提供可以幫助我們搬運證物的裝置，正如剛才行政長官提及，例如外骨架助力器，有助消防人員負重上樓梯；和機械化運輸帶等。我們亦會統籌醫衞局（醫務衞生局）所需的醫療物資，包括專門解毒劑和嚴重燒傷專用的醫療耗材，以及發展局在盡量增加樣本測試容量方面，希望內地提供我們所需的協助。

我的匯報到這裏為止。謝謝大家。

政務司副司長：以下我會講講緊急支援及募捐工作組的相關措施。

第一，社會福利署（社署）會採取「一戶一社工」的措施，安排每戶一名專業社工，全程照顧及跟進，為居民安排所需福利，並與其他部門及單位協調，陪伴住戶度過艱難時刻。社署社工其實從昨日起已一直在現場聯絡受影響住戶，如住戶有需要，亦可主動聯絡社署職員。

第二，火災後，居民大多身無長物，需要一些緊急的金錢去應急，支付必需的日常開支，以解燃眉之急。就此，政府會向每一個受影響住戶派發一萬元的應急錢，我們預備了現金今日優先發放給在各庇護中心暫住的宏福苑居民。各庇護中心和大埔民政諮詢服務中心亦會接受其他宏福苑居民的應急錢申請，盡快發放。此外，我們正想方設法為災民提供公共交通優惠，方便出行，事成便會盡快公布。

第三，如行政長官剛才所言，政府已成立大埔宏福苑援助基金，我們投入了三億元作為起動資金，協助居民及支持各項相關工作。支援基金在今晚七時起開始接受個人及機構的捐款，港元捐款是中銀香港戶口號碼是012-875-2-190159-7及其他貨幣捐款戶口號碼是012-875-2-190160-7。

在物資捐贈方面，目前我們已經收到很多捐贈，物資基本充足。如果我們仍要社會捐贈，我們會作出宣布。

第四，今次重大事故導致大量人命傷亡，如果災民在殯葬上對火化服務及骨灰龕位有要求，食物環境衞生署會加速處理、全力配合。

最後，行政長官已經指示公務員事務局啓動「全政府動員」機制。所有政策局及部門需要安排足夠人手，隨時為需要額外人手的行動提供支援。例如，當災場解封時，政府會動員公務員，協助重返家園的災民，進行清理、收拾等工作。

我的簡報完畢。

財政司副司長：政府明白受火災影響的居民，在應急住宿上，有非常迫切的需要，行政長官指示成立應急住宿安排工作組，由我擔任組長，成員包括民青局（民政及青年事務局）、房屋局、發展局及勞福局（勞工及福利局）等的局長。小組目前的工作主要有兩方面。

第一，社署社工會聯絡不同住戶，了解他們的情況和需要。作為一個即時的緩衝安排，透過民青局同事的努力，政府已經物色到接近1 000個單位，這些單位位於不同的青年宿舍或酒店之內，可以讓受影響居民留宿起碼一至兩個星期。社署社工會盡快安排相關居民入住。這些青年宿舍和酒店在香港不同地區，以青年宿舍來說，例如有位於深水埗的南昌匯、位於元朗的保良局李兆基青年綠洲、位於啟德的啟航1331等；而酒店方面就包括屯門黃金海岸酒店、香港富麗敦海洋公園酒店、沙田帝逸酒店、灣仔木棉花酒店、荃灣如心酒店等。我知道酒店數目正在增加中，大家都想幫手。，詳情民青局稍後會提供進一步的訊息。

關於後續的過渡安排，主要以政府的過渡性房屋，以及房協（香港房屋協會）的專用安置屋邨單位為主，我們估計初步合共可提供接近1 800個單位。這些單位有水電，可供煮食，單位內亦有淋浴設施。這些單位亦位於香港不同地區，包括大埔、葵青、元朗、柴灣、黃大仙、深水埗等等。社署社工會聯絡受影響住戶，按個別的需要及情況，作適當的入住安排。詳情房屋局稍後會有公布。我的匯報到這裏為止。

行政長官：接下來我請勞福局局長和民青局局長，向大家講解一下他們在各自範疇推進的工作，我亦請了保安局局長和消防處處長來此，如果大家有關於這些方面的問題提出，他們都可以回答。我首先請勞福局局長。

勞工及福利局局長：各位，除了剛提到會安排「一戶一社工」去跟進外，我們在現場留意到有體弱的長者，以及殘疾人士，我們已按他們的需要和意願安排暫託。至於年輕人和小孩，我們亦利用了於大埔的資源為他們提供託管安排，確保他們得到良好照顧。在醫院方面，醫務社工亦會為家屬提供一切可行的支援。此外，整個社福界都已經聯合動起來，會動用社福界所有資源，為有需要的災民提供各式各樣的社福支持。

另外，現時在各個庇護中心，我們都很感謝大家，很熱心地捐出不同物資，現時的物資都已足夠應付。我們知道大家想繼續幫忙，現在也有一些科技界朋友，希望可以創立平台供大家登記，稍後如果我們透過這些科技界朋友設計到一個平台，便可以供大家登記，但在這段時間，我想庇護中心需要先處理大家早前捐出的物資，我們希望可以有序地去安排物資。

在過去一日，我們透過不同的私營機構和慈善團體物色到1 000個房間，包括青年宿舍和在啟德的青年驛站。我們知道在網上有很多朋友說要開放青年驛站，開放啟德，甚至表示要幫忙做義工。這些工作我們已經準備好，很多謝大家的幫忙和熱心，但正如剛才孫局長所說的，我們會有「一戶一社工」，透過社工協助這些住戶搬入臨時住宿，而長遠亦有社工跟進他們的住屋和其他的福利需要。

少數族裔關愛隊也到各個庇護中心，了解是否有少數族裔市民有需要，我們暫時還沒有看到。我們暫時有這些報告，在接下來的日子，民青局和民政署的團隊一定會緊守崗位，協助我們大埔宏福苑的居民，渡過這個艱難的時間，也希望所有市民能夠繼續支持和配合我們各方面的工作，多謝大家對受影響居民的關心和支持。"

今日凌晨，我在威爾斯親王醫院會見傳媒時講述了政府正在四方面積極推動應對今次大火事件的工作，首先是滅火和救援被困的居民，第二是救治傷者，第三是支援善後，第四是全面調查。

今早，我召開了跨部門會議，統籌全體政策局和各部門全面跟進火災的應對工作，並聽取司局長匯報其範疇下所推進的工作和最新進展。接着的工作會聚焦在以下幾方面。

我下午到了火災現場，視察最新情況，亦聽取了消防處和現場人員的匯報。

首先，我說說滅火和救援方面的最新情況。到目前為止，大埔宏福苑全部七座大廈的火勢，基本上受控。到目前為止，大火已造成55人死亡。在火勢逐步受控的情況下，消防員已經成功拯救了55人。縱然現場環境複雜，無論如何消防員的拯救工作不會停頓，全力以赴。

有關受影響居民的應急住宿安排，到目前為止，我們已開放了9個庇護中心，目前有超過500名居民正使用。我們亦正統籌公私營力量，動用所有資源為居民提供所需的應急住宿支援，民政及青年事務局物色到接近1 000個單位作即時緩衝安排，這些單位位於不同的青年宿舍或酒店之內，可以讓受影響居民留宿起碼一至兩個星期。而後續安排則主要以政府的過渡性房屋，以及房協的專用安置屋邨為主，初步合共可提供約1 800個單位，照顧災民住宿的即時需要。

另外，政府已經動員社工、臨床心理學家、教育心理學家等支援人員，為受影響的居民、學生提供協助，包括情緒支援、經濟援助、院舍及幼兒暫託照顧等。

我們亦已安排「一戶一社工」，為各個受影響家庭及有需要人士提供適切支援。社會福利署會與各政府部門保持緊密聯繫，為受影響居民提供一切所需協助。

我們亦統籌了公私營醫療界別專業人員，包括來自私營界別的超過250位醫生和超過250位其他醫護專業人員，於所有臨時庇護中心設立醫療站。醫療站每日上午八時至晚上八時為有需要的居民提供適切醫療協助，包括基本醫療評估和轉介服務、處理輕微創傷，甚至是處方藥物，包括根據病歷提供所需的藥物補充，我們亦會提供心理支援，以協助處理非緊急醫療需求。

至於死難者的殮葬安排，食物環境衞生署會特事特辦，提供全面協助，按家屬意願，以專項形式加快處理，另外亦有機構已表示會提供免費殯葬服務。

在調查及規管工作方面，警務處、消防處所成立的專案小組已經全面展開工作。警方凌晨拘捕三名男子涉嫌誤殺，他們是負責屋苑大廈維修的工程公司負責人，目前仍被扣查。警方今早亦到現場搜證調查。政府化驗所全力配合調查工作。

政府亦已即時進行分批巡查全港正進行外牆大維修而有搭建棚架保護網的樓宇。發展局亦已經與業界會面，商討推進金屬棚架取代竹棚架的路線圖。

政府會開設一個專門網頁，發布有關這件事情的最新消息。

我再次感謝習近平主席對今次事件的高度重視，內地不同單位都表示很願意支持我們，我很感謝他們。特區政府已正在草擬一份物資和支援的清單，我們會通過中央港澳工作辦公室和我們的應急機制，希望內地單位提供協助。這些清單的內容包括甚麼？例如：勘察無人機，亦有可以幫助消防員爬上多層梯級的助力器，也有運輸輸送帶，如可以供應給我們將讓我們在多方面的工作可以更快捷。

在醫療方面，我們亦希望能提供例如是在醫療方面的解毒劑，以及處理燒傷的醫療耗材，我們亦希望能提供一些實驗室測試材料。這個清單我們在擬備中，我們會盡快向港澳辦和經過我們的應急機制希望可以盡快取得，以增加我們的救援工作。

我亦多謝中央港澳辦工作小組已經抵港協助我們開展救援工作，這亦表示中央對香港的關愛和國家「一方有難、八方支援」的精神。

我知道大家都對事件感到極度悲痛，我們正在經歷一場集體傷痛，在這個艱難時刻，我們更加需要堅強面對，共度時艱。

我希望社會各界將哀痛和關愛轉化為建設力量，我們共同維持社會正常運作，讓社會可以早日復原。因應今次事件，我宣布以下幾個安排。

第一，未來這段期間，所有政府主辦的慶祝活動將會取消或延期，而政府官員會減少出席非必要的公開活動，聚焦處理支援善後工作。我們亦將舉辦悼念活動，稍後會公布詳情。

第二，我們會成立「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，政府會投入三億元，為受影響居民提供援助。我亦知道很多熱心人士和機構想提供幫助，亦表示希望可以作出一些捐輸。我們已經設立了一個戶口，這個是在中銀香港的戶口，戶口號碼是012-875-2-190159-7，今晚七時開始接受大家透過戶口捐贈。我們會確保這個基金會用在大埔宏福苑的援助工作。為了即時幫助受影響居民，我們會在今晚即時向每戶災民派發一萬元應急補助金，以解燃眉之急。

第三，由於之後的支援工作有可能需要大量人手，政府已經啓動公務員動員機制，我們會通知所有部門人員隨時候命，提供支援。事實上，亦有很多公務員表示他們希望參與工作，尤其是當災場受控解封之後，災民重返家園，進行清理、收拾時，除了消防人員和警務人員提供需要的幫助外，我們會動員公務員陪同這些災民，提供協助。

第四，為全面確保我們的工作可以積極推展，我會成立三個工作組，第一個是調查及規管工作組，由政務司司長做組長；第二個是緊急支援及募捐工作組，由政務司副司長做組長，第三個是應急住宿安排工作組，由財政司副司長做組長。這三個工作組會按照我的要求，積極推展工作。稍後我會請他們向大家講述工作細節。

我在此希望再次向不眠不休投入救援工作的消防人員、警務人員、醫護人員和前線人員等致謝。有消防員不幸殉職，是我們重大損失，所以我們亦會全力支援因公殉職同事的家人，提供一切協助。我亦在此再次感謝很多熱心人士主動做不同的義務工作，甚至是提供很多物資，這個亦都反映了我們香港大愛無疆，「一方有難、八方支援」的守護精神。在此，我再次多謝大家。我首先請政務司司長向大家說說其工作組的工作。"

The trade should stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it.

Product details are as follows:

Product name: Pure Pistachio Paste Deluxe 100%
Brand: Convivia
Place of origin: Italy
Net Weight: 200 grams
Best-before date: February 17, 2027
Retailer: UK Store by HKTVmall

  ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from an online vendor for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that it contained aflatoxin at a level of 15 micrograms per kilogram,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

Under the Harmful Substances in Food Regulation (Cap 132AF), the maximum concentration for aflatoxin in any other food is 10 micrograms per kilogram.

The CFS has informed the online vendor and retailer concerned of the unsatisfactory test result. The vendor concerned has stopped sales and removed the affected batch of the product from shelves. The retailer concerned has initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 3145 6888 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

The World Health Organization (WHO)'s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified naturally occurring aflatoxins as carcinogenic to humans, and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives advised that intake of aflatoxins should be reduced to levels as low as reasonably possible although no health-based guidance value has been set. Aflatoxins can lead to liver cancer after long-term ingestion, and the risk for hepatitis B carriers is relatively high.

The spokesman urged members of the public who had bought the affected product to stop consuming it. To avoid excessive intake of mycotoxins, people should maintain a balanced and varied diet to minimise the risk from a small range of food items, and to avoid consuming food that looks mouldy or damaged.

The CFS has alerted the trade, continuing to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."
食安中心呼籲市民不要食用一款可能受黃曲霉毒素污染的預先包裝開心果醬,2025-11-27 20:14,2025-11-27 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700704.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（十一月二十七日）呼籲市民不要食用一款預先包裝開心果醬，因為有關產品可能受黃曲霉毒素污染。業界如持有受影響批次產品，應立即停止使用或出售。

產品詳情如下：

產品名稱：Pure Pistachio Paste Deluxe 100%
品牌：Convivia
來源地：意大利
淨重量：200克
此日期前最佳：二○二七年二月十七日
零售商：英式超市 by HKTVmall

中心發言人說：「中心透過恆常食物監測計劃，從一間網上商店抽取上述樣本進行檢測。結果顯示樣本每公斤含十五微克黃曲霉毒素。」

根據《食物內有害物質規例》（第132AF章）的規定，任何其他食物黃曲霉毒素的可容許最高濃度為每公斤食物含十微克。

中心已知會涉事網上商店及零售商上述不合格化驗結果，並指令其將受影響批次產品停售及下架。有關零售商已按中心指示展開回收，市民可於辦公時間致電其熱線3145 6888，查詢上述產品的回收事宜。

天然存在的黃曲霉毒素已被世界衞生組織屬下的國際癌症研究機構確認對人類致癌。聯合國糧食及農業組織／世界衞生組織聯合食物添加劑專家委員會雖然沒有為其製訂健康參考值，但建議在合理的情況下，應將黃曲霉毒素的攝入量減到最少。長期攝入黃曲霉毒素可能會引致肝癌，對乙型肝炎帶菌者更會構成較大的風險。

發言人呼籲市民如曾購買受影響產品，應停止食用。為避免攝入過多霉菌毒素，市民應保持均衡及多元化的飲食，減低因偏食某幾種食物引致的風險，並避免食用發霉或受損的食物。

中心已知會業界、繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-11-27 20:01,2025-11-27 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700739.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 27) recorded another severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP urged parents to arrange for their children to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 2-year-old girl with good past health. She developed a fever, vomiting and loose stool since November 25. She was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital yesterday (November 26) and was admitted. Due to shock and deterioration of general condition, she was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of the hospital, and is being arranged to transfer to Hong Kong Children's Hospital for further treatment. She is currently in critical condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with shock, encepathopathy and multi-organ failure.

The girl had not yet received the 2025/26 SIV and had no travel history during the incubation period. One of her household contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms recently, but did not require hospitalisation and has recovered.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 22 severe influenza cases involving children so far this summer influenza season, including two fatal cases. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years. A total of 13 cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine.

""According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity has gradually declined since late October. However, it remains above the baseline thresholds. As the weather turns cooler, influenza activity may still fluctuate. Moreover, a winter influenza season may occur early next year. Therefore, I once again urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV to do so promptly. Compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, there have been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases this season. Currently, among children aged below 18 years, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, at nearly 17 per cent only. Parents should not hesitate and should contact their family doctors as soon as possible to arrange for their children, as well as themselves and other family members, to receive the SIV,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

Additionally, as some victims have inhaled toxic gases, the Hyper-baric Oxygen Therapy Centre at Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital has enhanced its staffing to provide hyper-baric oxygen therapy for injured patients as needed.

""With the large number of casualties requiring medical care, the HA has been closely coordinating and monitoring the mobilisation of hospital beds and manpower across different hospitals, particularly beds of intensive care unit, to ensure adequate resources for appropriate treatment of the injured. The HA extends its gratitude to all healthcare staff on duty for their dedicated care of the injured, especially those who were off-duty or cancelled their leave to return to hospitals to assist in treating the casualties,"" the spokesperson said.

In addition to enhanced staffing at public hospitals to care for the injured, the Family Medicine clinics of the HA have also strengthened their services to support affected residents. Those with medical needs can directly visit Family Medicine clinics for assistance.

再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-27 18:53,2025-11-27 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700694.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十七日）再接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案。中心呼籲家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的兩歲女童。她於十一月二十五日出現發燒、嘔吐及糞便稀爛，昨日（十一月二十六日）被帶到基督教聯合醫院急症室求醫並入住該院，及後因休克及身體狀況轉差，轉到該院兒童深切治療部接受治療，現正獲安排轉到香港兒童醫院接受進一步治療，目前情況危殆。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H3）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克、腦病變和多重器官衰竭。

女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗，於潛伏期內不曾外遊。她的一名家居接觸者近日曾出現呼吸道病徵，病況輕微，無需住院及已康復。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得22宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括兩宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的13宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度自十月下旬起逐漸下降，但仍高於基線水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近17%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得72宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

近期錄得的輸入個案中，有五名患者居於青衣。中心的流行病學調查顯示，他們在潛伏期及發病後在青衣北活動的範圍有重疊，主要包括青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近。中心已把個案活動的地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），進行控蚊滅蚊行動。中心亦正就病人樣本進行基因排序及分析，並對比其他本地及輸入個案，以確定他們之間是否有關聯。由於部分確診個案報稱，在青衣自然徑行山期間曾被蚊叮咬，中心認為青衣自然徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線（2125 2373），熱線每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗，而過去四天中心未有接獲有病徵人士致電查詢。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；

Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

 Among the recently recorded imported cases, five reside in Tsing Yi. The CHP's epidemiological investigation revealed that their activities during the incubation and infectious periods overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily around Tsing Yi town centre and the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The CHP has notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the locations visited by the five patients for mosquito control operations. The CHP is also performing genomic sequencing and analysis on patient samples, comparing them with other local and imported cases to determine whether these cases are linked. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have hiked in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area since November 1 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary. The CHP has not received any enquiries from symptomatic individuals over the past four days. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Frederick (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Professor Frederick Ma), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Ciao. Good morning.

Thank you for observing a moment of silence with us together, for the 55 lives lost in a tragic fire that took place in Hong Kong yesterday. Our hearts and thoughts are with all the victims and their families. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is now doing as much as we can to help all those who are affected by this very unfortunate incident.

To officially begin this Symposium, may I first express our heartfelt thanks to the magnificent city of Milan - Italy's fast-beating economic heart, and one of the world's foremost fashion and design capitals, home of elegance, enterprise, for hosting this event. My thanks also go to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for putting this Symposium together.

A tale of two cities, two economies

For long, Hong Kong and Italy have much in common. We share a passion for creativity, craftsmanship, and elegance. Italian style has captured our hearts.

Our two cities are gateways connecting continents, blending Eastern and Western ingenuity. And we both thrive on openness, creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.

Our economic partnership is flourishing and remarkably diverse, too. In 2024, bilateral merchandise trade reached €7.2 billion. Some 200 Italian companies, from world-beating brands to leading players in banking, insurance, logistics and chocolate, have their regional headquarters, offices or operations in Hong Kong.

Think business, do business, with Hong Kong

Today's symposium is not just about thinking business. It's about doing business. Together.

We've brought with us an 80-strong delegation of Hong Kong business leaders spanning finance, innovation, technology, logistics, and the creative industries. I invite you to rise. Yes, they're here to explore opportunities with you, and to invite you to consider the vast possibilities Hong Kong, Asia's world city, can offer you.

For the next few minutes, allow me to explain why Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to be your long-term partner.

One country, two systems: our enduring strength

Hong Kong's unique strength is premised on our ""one country, two systems"" framework. It gives us the best of both worlds: seamless access to the Chinese Mainland's vast market, and unfettered connectivity with the world, with unparalleled opportunities for business and investment. We are a market economy upholding the common law system with a strong tradition of rule of law, a low and simple tax regime and business practices aligning with the highest international standards.

We are a free port, maintaining a free flow of goods, capital, information and people.

And the ""one country, two systems"" framework is here to stay for the long term, a position reiterated time and again by President Xi Jinping and affirmed at high-level state and party meetings in Beijing.

The rule of law is a defining feature of our city. Our judiciary exercises its powers independently, and the Court of Final Appeal sits in Hong Kong, with six non-permanent judges from overseas common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

Hong Kong also offers robust intellectual property protection. Our legal framework is fully compliant with WTO standards, and our High Court has specialist judges for IP cases. That makes Hong Kong a city you can count on to protect your innovations and creative work. And that, I know, is essential to Italian businesses, where design is both a profession and a passion.

Where Hong Kong stands today

The Hong Kong economy has, again, had a good year.

In international reports, Hong Kong continues to be ranked the world's freest economy, and we are consistently among the top three global financial centres. The IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook this year placed us third, globally. And all three major international credit rating agencies have reaffirmed our strong standing.

Hong Kong is also the gateway to the GBA - the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a fast-growing, young and affluent market with an increasingly global outlook.

The GBA has a combined GDP of €1.8 trillion, a population of 87 million, and a per capita GDP of about €20,000. It is a vast and promising market for Italian goods and services, offering opportunities from luxury and lifestyle to technology and healthcare.

The Greater Bay Area is also a global leader in innovation and technology. This year, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster was named the world's number one innovation cluster by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

These and other fundamental strengths make Hong Kong a prime springboard for Italian businesses eager to realise opportunities in China and across Asia.

Hong Kong: a leading IFC

Let me highlight a few areas that I believe will be particularly attractive to Italian businesses, starting with finance.

Hong Kong is one of the world's leading international financial centres. Some 70 of the world's top 100 banks and six of the top 10 global insurance companies operate in our city.

Our stock market, with a market capitalisation of €5.3 trillion, and the Hang Seng Index up by more than 25 per cent to date, is among the world's best performers this year.

We have a singular advantage: the ""Connect Schemes"" – that provide mutual-market access between Hong Kong and the Mainland. For international investors, it is a trusted avenue for accessing the Mainland's capital market. More than 70 per cent of China A-shares' foreign holdings, for example, were acquired through our Stock Connect Scheme.

Italian companies like Prada and Ferretti are already listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and I encourage more Italian companies to pursue dual listings on both Borsa Italiana and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Through our Southbound Connect, Italian companies can tap into Mainland liquidity, gaining a level of access no other international financial centre can provide.

We also invite Italian companies and banks to issue Renminbi bonds in Hong Kong. Our vibrant bond market offers multi-currency options, including USD, euro and RMB. Italian banks can use Hong Kong's Renminbi clearing and settlement system for trade settlement and other Renminbi-denominated financial transactions. That can only enable more efficient trade between Italy and China.

International innovation and technology hub

Hong Kong is also rapidly developing as an international hub for innovation and technology. We focus on four key areas: artificial intelligence, biotech, fintech, and new energy and new materials.

Our academic and research capabilities are world-class. Five of our universities are ranked among the global top 100. Three are ranked in the top 20 globally for AI and data science, and two of our medical schools are among the world's top 25.

We are now building a more complete innovation value chain, one that integrates basic research, commercialisation and advanced manufacturing. To that end, we are attracting strategic enterprises, either world leaders in their fields or companies engaged in cutting-edge technologies. Over the past three years, we have welcomed more than 100 strategic enterprises to Hong Kong, including four of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies. They are establishing R&D centres, expanding their operations in Hong Kong and investing in our shared future.

Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport welcome Italian start-ups and innovators. Our I&T centres provide a range of services, from incubation, funding, professional advisory to market development support.

The Northern Metropolis, an area bordering Shenzhen and covering one-third of Hong Kong's landmass, will be the heart of our I&T future. The San Tin Technopole, a cluster similar to the Milan Innovation District, will rise as one of its innovation hubs.

We are working closely with Shenzhen, in a co-operation zone along the border. Within that zone, Mainland capital, talent, goods, data and even biosamples will move freely to Hong Kong, giving companies access to both international and Mainland data, a significant advantage for artificial intelligence, bio and pharmaceutical companies looking to tap the vast Chinese market.

I invite Italian innovators and companies, particularly those in life sciences, precision engineering, advanced manufacturing, and luxury tech, to establish R&D centres and operations in this Northern Metropolis. There, they can collaborate with tech companies from Hong Kong and the Mainland, along with start-ups, universities and research institutions.

Culture and creativity

Finally, let me speak about culture and creativity, an area close to the Italian heart.

Hong Kong is Asia's cultural hub and a rising design hub. Our West Kowloon Cultural District has emerged as a world-class arts and cultural centre. It features M+ Museum, Asia's global museum of contemporary visual arts, design and architecture, as well as the Hong Kong Palace Museum, with more than 900 treasures from Beijing's Palace Museum.

Business of Design Week, or BODW, opening next Monday, has become Asia's most anticipated design event, bringing together creative minds from around the world to showcase their innovation and design excellence.

And we thank Italy for being so kind as the BODW's Partner Country again this year. Italian contributions to furniture design, textile innovation, the intersection of design with technology and sport, and much more will be featured at the Design Week.

Closing remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunities there for us are both wide-ranging and far-reaching, whether you are in luxury goods, industrial design, fintech, biotech, healthcare, logistics or the creative industries.

Italian businesses can tap into Asia's dynamism through Hong Kong and our connectivity, financial services, innovation and cultural bridges.

You'll hear about that, and much more, in today's panel discussions and the plenary session beginning in just a few minutes.

Let us think business - and do business - together. Build a rewarding future. Together.

Grazie mille. Thank you very much."

The survey did not cover labour-only sub-contractors that mainly supplied labour to work on a job-to-job basis, owing to practical consideration in data collection. The employment figures above mainly covered direct employees of the construction companies and did not reflect the labour input through the sub-contracting activities of labour-only sub-contractors.

Apart from the construction sector, the survey also enumerated companies engaged in real estate activities; and architectural, surveying and engineering services.

The case involved three roller shutters at the front/rear doors and the removal of the protected lobby and wall separating the premises from the carpark of an industrial building at Shing Wan Road, Sha Tin. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owners were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (November 27), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

The Government's Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre was activated immediately and officers from relevant departments closely monitored the situation in real time, co-ordinating efforts to strive to alleviate the impact of the fire.

Various government departments and units are making every effort on multiple fronts: the top priority is extinguishing the fire and rescuing trapped residents; the second is treating the injured; the third is providing postâincident support, offering assistance to the families of the deceased, the injured, and affected residents; and the fourth is conducting a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire.

The Fire Services Department (FSD) received reports at 2.51pm yesterday that a fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po.

The Housing Bureau and the Housing Department have also been maintaining close contact with the Home Affairs Department and the Social Welfare Department to provide full assistance to the affected residents, including arranging the residents of Wang Fuk Court and Kwong Fuk Estate in need to reside in transitional housing, interim housing or transit centres.

The Tai Po District Office (TPDO) has opened eight temporary shelters for residents in need and has arranged shuttle bus services for residents. As at 9.30pm yesterday, about 900 persons are using the shelters. The TPDO will continue to closely monitor the situation and open more shelters as necessary.

The TPDO has deployed all 19 Care Teams across the district to provide support, while the Sha Tin District Office (STDO) nearby and its Care Teams have also provided cross-district support. Care Teams in other districts will also be mobilised to provide appropriate support. The TPDO, STDO and North District Office have also set up interdepartmental help desks at Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital and North District Hospital to provide assistance and handle public enquiries. The TPDO will provide assistance to families of the deceased and injured in their applications for the Emergency Relief Fund or the Special Aid Fund, as well as liaise with various assistance funds operated by other charitable organisations.

The Social Welfare Department has deployed social work officers and supporting staff to the help desks and shelters for provision of assistance to the residents. Besides, the Civil Aid Service also mobilised over 100 personnel to assist with the operation of the temporary shelters. In addition, medical social workers are also providing emotional support to the injured persons and their families. Through liaison by the TPDO, the Hong Kong Red Cross deployed personnel to the temporary shelters to provide emotional support and medical assistance to people in need. The Health Bureau has also arranged for the ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"" to step up its manpower to handle calls from people with needs for emotional support in relation to the fire. Moreover, support information on coping with stress or negative emotions has also been posted to ""Shall We Talk"" social media channels.

The Buildings Department (BD) has long been implementing strict requirements on the use of fire retardant protective nets, screens, tarpaulins, plastic sheeting and the like for scaffolds to prevent the spread of fire should a fire occur. Last month, the BD issued a circular letter to all registered building professionals and registered contractors, urging them to inspect and ascertain that the protective net and the like used in their construction projects are in compliance with the recognised standards in terms of fire retardant capability.

Wang Fuk Court is a sold property under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS). The works are carried out by Prestige Construction & Engineering Company, Limited, a registered contractor hired by the Incorporated Owners of the HOS court. The Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau (ICU) exercises building control over the works in accordance with the Buildings Ordinance. Regarding the fire incident, the ICU will conduct an investigation. If any violations of the requirements of the Buildings Ordinance are found, the case will be referred to the BD for handling in accordance with the ordinance, including prosecution or disciplinary proceedings.

In response to the fire incident, the BD and the ICU will also carry out special operations targeting ongoing construction projects. Registered building professionals and registered contractors will be required to review relevant records or test certificates relating to fire retardant properties of the protective nets and the like used in scaffolds, and submit their reports to the relevant departments.

As at midnight, the fire has resulted in 36 deaths and 36 injuries, including one fireman among the deceased. The FSD is making every effort to extinguish the fire, which is gradually under control. Staff from various government departments will continue to fulfil their duties diligently, fully engaging in response and relief work, as well as providing appropriate support to citizens in need."
行政長官探望大埔五級火警傷者和受影響居民後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-11-27 03:57,2025-11-27 04:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700082.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（十一月二十七日）聯同保安局局長鄧炳強、醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授、民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟和消防處處長楊恩健，在探望大埔五級火警傷者和受影響居民後會見傳媒。以下是他們會見傳媒的談話內容：

行政長官：對於昨日下午在大埔宏福苑發生的五級大火導致多人傷亡，我感到極度難過。到目前為止，這場大火已造成36人死亡，有279名人士失聯，仍然在醫院留醫有29人，其中七人危殆。我對死者致以深切哀悼，對死者家屬和傷者致以深切慰問，我們會提供一切可行的支援。

習近平主席對於今次的大火高度重視，第一時間了解火災救援和人員傷亡的情況，向我轉達他對遇難人員和殉職消防員的哀悼、對遇難者家屬和受災人員的慰問，並且要求中央港澳辦和香港中聯辦支持特區政府，全力以赴撲滅火災。我衷心感謝習近平主席的關心，亦感謝港澳辦和中聯辦向我提出會全力支持。

到目前，在消防人員的不斷努力之下，現場的情況逐漸受控。目前為止，消防處處長評估他們有足夠人手和能力控制並撲滅火災。我將會請消防處處長向大家講解這方面。

我今日到訪了大埔社區中心的臨時庇護中心，探望了疏散後到這個庇護中心的居民。庇護中心裏有86個家庭，共169人。庇護中心為他們服務的，包括醫生和護理人員、民政事務處的同事、社會福利署的人員、警務處的人員、紅十字會的一些緊急救護人士，亦有關愛隊。我探望他們的時候，其中有一對夫婦，丈夫七十多歲，他向我講述當時他的情況。他當時剛出門買東西，買東西回來就看到火災了。另外大約十多位進入庇護中心的人士，我也安慰他們，表示我們會提供所有他們希望的任何服務。稍後我會請麥美娟局長向大家講解這方面，我們支援有需要幫助人士的各種工作。

我極度重視今次事件，我已經指示政府各個部門和單位全力進行多方面的工作。首先的工作，最首要的工作就是撲滅這次火災和救援被困的居民。第二是救治傷者，第三是支援善後，接着，我們會做全面的調查。

在滅火和救援被困居民方面，消防處調動了共140多輛消防車和60多輛救護車，動員的消防員和救護員共800多人，也使用了無人機了解災場的情況。我指示了消防處動用所有需要的資源和人力，全速撲救這次大火。我也告訴消防處，政府所有資源都會全力支持今次撲滅火災的工作。現場的火勢逐步受控，現在有三棟樓宇從外看已經沒有火光，另外有四棟我們看到有零星的火光。稍後消防處處長會向大家講解他們撲滅這場火災所做的工作。

第二方面是救治傷者。醫管局已經啓動了重大事故控制中心，統籌和協調安排了九間公立醫院的急診室作出戒備。其中，新界東醫院聯網三間急症醫院，包括那打素醫院、威爾斯親王醫院、北區醫院，包括急診室和其他部門，例如深切治療、燒傷科等不同部門的同事都全力以赴進行救援。

北區醫院派出一隊醫療隊，威爾斯親王醫院亦派出一名醫療控制主任前往現場作分流及提供緊急治理。由於涉及多名燒傷傷者，瑪麗醫院和威爾斯親王醫院的燒傷中心及東區尤德夫人那打素醫院高壓氧治療中心都已經準備就緒，隨時接收受傷、需要診治的人員。我已經要求醫管局統籌，全力救治傷者。稍後我會請盧局長向大家講解救治的工作。

第三方面是支援善後，向死者家屬、傷者以及受影響的居民提供援助。大埔民政事務處已經開放了八個庇護中心，民政處也已經安排穿梭巴士接載居民，直至九時半，庇護中心使用的人數大約是900人。民政處會密切監察情況，按需要繼續開放更多的庇護中心。大埔區已經派出全區的關愛隊支援，也動員了沙田區的關愛隊，民安隊也動員了人手配合庇護中心的工作。大埔民政處和沙田民政處已經在那打素醫院、威爾斯親王醫院和北區醫院設立了跨部門的援助站，為受影響的居民提供協助。大埔民政處會協助有需要的死傷者家屬申請緊急救援基金或特別援助基金，亦會為他們聯絡其他慈善組織的各類援助基金。

社會福利署已即時安排社工和支援人員到現場救援站及各庇護中心，為居民提供協助。另外，醫務社工正為傷者及相關家屬提供情緒支援。經民政處聯絡，香港紅十字會亦已全面派員提供情緒支援及簡單醫療服務。稍後我會請麥美娟局長跟大家講解這方面的工作。

第四方面是全面調查事件，查出火警起因。警務處、消防處已經成立了專案小組全面調查。這件事件一定會提交給死因裁判法庭。

另外，房屋局獨立審查組會就建築物的外牆保護材料是否符合認可阻燃標準進行調查，採集樣本作化驗，如有任何情況，我們會依法、依規追究責任。

另外，屋宇署及房屋局獨立審查組會採取特別行動，針對正進行中的工程，要求註冊建築專業人士及承建商，全面覆核棚架保護網等用料符合阻燃性標準，提交報告。另外，屋宇署和房屋局會主動抽查地盤有關的保護幕和保護網是否符合安全要求，會抽樣進行測試。

這次的重大災難，政府會全面動員、全力以赴，向我剛才說的四個方向推展工作，首要的是將現場的大火全面控制，將它完全撲滅。現在我首先請盧局長說明一下醫治方面的工作。有請盧局長。

醫務衞生局局長：我報告一下關於醫院管理局（醫管局）在災難發生後，已啓動重大事故控制中心，同時動員醫管局九間有急症室的醫院作戒備，特別是新界東的三間醫院，包括威爾斯親王醫院、北區醫院和雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院作為重點收治病人，但後來因為病人數量較多，我們現時總共有九間醫院有收治病人。送入醫管局的病人共有37人，其中有四位搶救無效死亡，另外有四位輕傷病人在治療後已經出院，現時仍有29名病人在醫院內，其中七位危殆、13位仍然嚴重。他們大部分最嚴重的是吸入性氣道創傷，因為在火災中有許多熱空氣令其氣道受損，許多人需要在深切治療部靠呼吸機治療，另一些是燒傷，亦有個別病人一氧化碳中毒，因為在密閉空間內產生了一氧化碳，其中有一位病人已經轉送到東區醫院的高壓氧治療艙接受高壓氧治療，我們預計可能仍會有兩個病人需要同樣治療而要轉去東區醫院。

另一方面，我們亦啓動了有燒傷組或燒傷中心的醫院，包括瑪麗醫院、廣華醫院，它們都會在適當時候接收一些燒傷的病人作跟進治療。另一方面，除了照顧這些已入院的病人外，我們亦要照顧其他災民，很多災民都有一些醫療上的需要，特別是一些長者，他們未有攜帶隨身的藥物。我們在第一個臨時庇護中心，已經由雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院派遣醫護人員為他們處理，如果他們有藥物方面的需要，我們會適當地給予幫助。另一方面，我們看到庇護中心亦不止一個，我們現在交了給基層醫療署去統籌，不論公營和私營的一些醫護人員，我們都收到很多私營醫療機構提出自願加入提供支援，我們會由基層醫療署作協調統籌工作，務求令每一個庇護中心都會有醫療團隊作支援，為中心的災民提供適當的醫療服務。

另一方面，考慮到火災可能引致很多情緒方面的一些困擾、情緒方面的問題，我們亦已經指示18111「情緒通」熱線增加人手。在過去數小時，我們已經看到「情緒通」熱線收到的求助電話有明顯上升的趨勢，所以我們會加大人手，務求提供適切的支援給一些受到火災引起情緒困擾的病人及市民。市民如果受到災情影響，有情緒困擾或有壓力，亦可以在我們的「Shall We Talk」（「陪我講Shall We Talk」）社交網站找到一些關於情緒壓力的支援資料。我向大家的報告到此為止。

行政長官：剛才我也探望了在這所醫院的五位病人。有三位是燒傷的，有一位較為嚴重，燒傷了三成。我非常感謝醫院醫生和護理人員很悉心地照顧他們。他們做了手術，正在休息，所以我跟醫生了解他們的情況之後，我便不打擾他們了。另外有兩位應該是吸入了一些濃煙或很熱的空氣而需要療養。我也聽取了醫院總監向我匯報整體這次應急和醫治方面，整個系統的運作和他們配置的人手。他們很關心每一位病人，也很適切地對他們提供所有可行的幫助，所以非常感謝他們。

另外，我也會見了殉職消防員的家屬，對他們致以深切的慰問，也表示我們會全力提供任何可以幫助他們度過這個艱難時期的所有支援。消防處所有同事也對於殉職的消防員同事感到很難過，所以我除了鼓勵醫院各個醫護人員以外，我也提出，如果有其他需要，政府可以動用的資源，可以向我提出。接着，我請麥美娟局長和大家談談庇護中心的工作。

民政及青年事務局局長：我代表民青局（民政及青年事務局）和民政總署（民政事務總署）的團隊向死者的家屬和傷者致以最深切的慰問。我們知道這段時間大家非常徬徨，我們的團隊一定會陪着大家度過這段艱難的時間。這個時候大家會很徬徨，剛才特首表示現時已在大埔區開放八個臨時庇護中心，動用了全區19隊關愛隊，約200多人，另外我們亦動員了沙田區的關愛隊。這次重大事件，我們會動員全港十八區的關愛隊，因為其他區的關愛隊隊員都非常關心事件，希望可以出一分力，所以我們會動員全港十八區的關愛隊，為有需要的市民提供一切支援。另外，當區區議員和民政處同事亦在庇護中心當值，稍後我們會協助這些家庭申請緊急援助，其實有些家庭已做了登記。在過去幾小時，不斷有慈善團體、私人機構或公營機構向我們提出捐贈物資和捐款協助這些受影響的市民，我們會統籌這方面的工作，也會協助有需要的市民登記。

另外，我們也明白這次重大事件，市民在心理或精神上會有困擾，所以社署（社會福利署）的同事除了在庇護中心提供情緒支援，也會提供情緒支援的服務予當區市民。我們希望大家如果受到精神困擾，甚至可能你不是住在當區，如果你看到新聞，感受到精神困擾，請大家和我們聯絡，我們一定會向大家提供支援。

就短期的住宿問題，我們已聯同房屋局提供過渡性房屋，也有慈善機構，甚至酒店業界，還有民青局旗下的青年宿舍，我們會動用所有可動用的房間，為受影響的市民提供短期住宿安排。總而言之，我們一定會盡所有力量，動用所有可動用的資源，陪伴市民度過難關。

行政長官：接着，我請保安局局長和消防處處長談談在現場的火災撲滅工作和現時我們開展了調查工作的首階段發現。

保安局局長：首先，我要對殉職的消防人員、受傷人士和家屬致以深切哀悼和慰問。在這次行動中，除了消防同事外，我們亦出動了大約100名民安隊隊員，以及大約1 000名警務人員。警務人員的工作除了維持秩序外，亦協助疏散，還有維持交通，還有就着一些失聯人士和受傷人士設立一個調查小組。

消防同事在滅火和救援過程中，我們發現有關大廈外牆的保護網和保護膜、一些防水的帆布和一些塑膠布，它們受火後，其蔓延程度是遠比一些合規格的物料猛烈，蔓延速度亦較快，我們覺得這是不尋常的。另外，我們亦在沒有受波及的屋苑大廈中，發現有玻璃窗被貼上一些發泡膠板。這些發泡膠板當遇熱時會很容易蔓延，我們亦覺得這是不尋常的。就着這兩方面不尋常的情況，我們會作出深入調查。警方和消防處已組成一個聯合隊伍，除了就着火警方面作出調查外，亦會循刑事方向作出調查。至於救援詳情，我交由消防處處長補充。

消防處處長：我談談現在救火的情況。剛才行政長官也有提到，現在有七座樓宇牽涉當中，有一座沒有被波及。我們看到現在的情況，當中有三座樓宇（的火勢）已初步受到控制；有四座樓宇看到裏面還有零星火種。現在我們的同事正一步一步推進，大致已到達大部份樓宇的十七、十八樓。

現在現場有888名消防人員進行灌救，我們相信現在的消防力量足以應付。不過我們現在面對的困難是本身大廈樓宇面積有限，有一些樓宇我們已派駐20多輛車輛的消防人員入內進行灌救。你可以想像到樓宇面積不是很大，每層其實也有很多消防員，我們已經把面積可以容納的消防員人數投放下去。

還有，我們需要一層一層進行滅火，完成了一層，我們就會向上推進去做滅火、救援的工作。至於剛剛局長提到，我們在救火期間，甚至在一座未起火的樓宇發現窗戶的通風位置被發泡膠板封住。這些發泡膠板的易燃性很高和火勢蔓延得很快，所以我們覺得這些發泡膠板的出現不尋常，所以我們把事件交由警方作進一步調查是否有刑事成分。

暫時我們的救火過程是一步一步有進展的，我們希望盡快可以達至所以樓層都可以進行滅火和救援的工作。我的簡報到這裏。

記者：明白消防一直都很用心救援，但是由下午起火，到現時為止，火勢其實始終都是未撲滅，總體來說，救援進度都是不理想？剛才提到發泡膠和棚架方面，是否未有辦法確定起火成因是甚麼？

行政長官：在我交給消防處處長前，這些調查工作，第一，我們一定有全面的調查，亦要基於科學證據，但剛才保安局局長提出的一些疑點，警方已經決定展開刑事調查。我相信在這些火警中，需要做大量的實驗室工作，這方面我們可以投入的資源都會投入，確保調查加快，我亦很有信心，在消防處和警務處全情投入下，會盡快將每個可能調查的線索都完全跟進起來。接下來我請消防處處長講解一下救火工作。

消防處處長：謝謝行政長官。談到我們的進度，我們面對的困難是我們到達現場的時候發現有很多樓層起火。正如剛才所說，我們見到（火場）裏面有一些發泡膠，令到火警蔓延速度加快，而引致火種經過走廊燒進一些單位，裏面會產生一些濃煙和熱力，所以我們的同事要由地下一層一層去推進、去進行滅火、救援的行動。我們現在，正如我剛才所說，大部分的樓層已經去到十七、八樓，我們要慢慢地替換人手，一層一層地去推進滅火工作。

記者：會否考慮向內地部門包括消防尋求支援呢？因為有片段見到消防已在口岸準備，政府會否有甚麼顧慮？

行政長官：首先，我很感謝習近平主席對這件事件的高度重視，亦要求了中央港澳辦和中央政府駐香港聯絡辦公室，提供任何特區政府所需要的支援，我亦收到周邊城市領導的聯絡，他們很熱心，如果我們需要任何協助，他們都會提供。我亦在整個救火過程中，不斷與消防處處長就這些問題探討。基於現時我們對於現場的火災情況逐步受控，剛才都看到，有幾座已經在外面看不到火種，有些則看到零星。剛才處長告訴大家，相信不久的時間後就可以全面控制火場。這方面我很感謝周邊城市不同單位的熱心，希望盡量幫助我們，解決這次大家都是非常痛心的一場火災，我們很感謝他們。我亦對於消防處每一位消防員盡心盡力，撲滅這次火災，我很感謝他們的努力工作。

記者：國家主席習近平高度重視這次火災事件，第一時間了解火災救援和人員傷亡的情況。特區政府亦已經啓動了應急救援機制，目前特區政府如何跟中央各部門進行密切溝通，做好下一階段的救援工作？

行政長官：我今日不斷收到周邊城市領導人或救火單位的聯繫，我和消防處處長在討論救火方面進度時，起初的確看到火勢是很猛烈，消防處有系統地部署救火工作，現時火勢逐步受控。當然，每一位曾經接觸我的周邊城市領導或有關單位，我都會聯絡他們，將我們的現時情況告訴他們，他們都很關心。我們有其他需要，例如醫療方面，如有大量傷者，需要甚麼醫療設備，甚至其他工具，他們都很願意提供，我和他們會保持聯絡，我亦在此再次感謝內地不同政府部門對我們的支持，亦再次感謝習主席對這件事件的高度重視和關心。

記者：你好，想問因為今次受災的一些住戶相信都已經損失慘重，以及重新安置都可能需要一些時間，想問預計會用多少時間來對他們進行支援？以及例如給予相關撫恤金等方面預計會使用多少錢？重新安置方面需要多少時間？謝謝。

行政長官：我想現在最重要就是醫治和他們的住宿，這方面麥局長剛才已經交代我們整體在現有政府資源中，我們可以提供甚麼安排給他們。這方面我們會繼續加大力度，明天我都會舉行一個跨部門會議，將我們所有資源統整，將我們不同災民的需求，我們都會做一個清單，看看我們如何全面配合他們。我亦都多謝有很多善心人，聯絡我、不同局長、司長，他們很願意提供幫助，幫助受火災影響的居民。我們統整所有這方面的需求和我們的資源，盡量幫助他們。

長遠來說，要經歷今次這麼大的傷痛，我相信在心靈方面的支援都是很重要，我們會組織專家團隊看看這方面我們怎樣可以做到最能幫助每一位人士的需要。我們亦都知道有很多志願團體表示他們都會提供一志自願服務，我們會凝聚所有力量，大家共同幫助受影響的居民渡過這次難關。

記者：你好，火警是今天下午大約三時發生，但都見到很多政策部門在黃昏時段還在社交網站宣傳一些關於選舉事宜，想問當局覺得這個做法是否恰當？選舉會否因應這次事件延期？謝謝。

行政長官：我們已經暫停去宣傳和推廣選舉的工作，論壇亦會暫停。目前來說整個政府都會全程投入處理今次這宗大型災難事件，所以我們目前心中首要的工作就是處理好今次這宗事件，其他事情在我們統整好工作，幾日後再作決定。但我亦希望大家知道，我們做每一件事都是以香港整體利益為依歸，所以我們會作全面審視。選舉的確亦是我們一件重要的工作，但目前來說，最重要的工作就是處理好今次火災撲滅事件，以及我們之後對需要援助的災民提供最適切和最全面的幫助。多謝大家。"
