"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-08-02 06:51,2025-08-02 07:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200188.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 2) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

EEB meets with trade representatives on the latest situation of chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-08-01 22:09,2025-08-01 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100938.htm," The Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) today (August 1) met with trade representatives on mosquito and pest control matters, to share with them the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF) and related counter measures and to strengthen co-operation among the Government, businesses and the community while encouraging various sectors to continue to adopt effective mosquito prevention and control measures so as to safeguard public health.

 The EEB has all along been concerned about the latest situation of CF and relevant preventive and control measures. The EEB has been collaborating with various government bureaux and departments and stakeholders of different trades to actively follow-up on mosquito prevention and control work. This morning, the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, Assistant Director (Operations) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) Mr Peter Poon and representatives from related departments visited Po Lam Estate, Po Tsui Park and their nearby areas in Tseung Kwan O before the meeting, to inspect the enhanced efforts to prevent CF in the community.

 The survey area inspected today recorded gravidtrap indices reaching Level 3 alert level in May this year, indicating extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The FEHD has been collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to continuously strengthen mosquito prevention and control work in areas under their purview, including eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and ensuring that mosquito trapping devices at appropriate locations are operating properly. The gravidtrap indices for this survey area in June and July have dropped to Level 2.

 The Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, together with representatives from the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health and the FEHD, met trade representatives this afternoon to brief them the latest situation of CF, the current situation in places outside Hong Kong, collaboration on disease prevention and control between the Mainland and Hong Kong, as well as risk assessment of Hong Kong, control measures at boundary control points, emergency preparedness, publicity and education efforts, etc.

 The representative of the FEHD reported to the meeting the most updated situation of gravidtrap indices. As at July this year, the gravidtrap indices for Aedes albopictus in June was 9.5 per cent, which was lower than the same period in 2023 and 2024 (16.4 per cent and 14.0 per cent respectively), with the overall situation remained at a relatively low level. From January 1 to July 31 this year, the gravidtrap indices in seven surveyed areas were higher than 20 per cent, reaching Level 3 alert level, indicating extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Based on the latest gravidtrap Index for Aedes albopictus, the FEHD, together with relevant government departments and stakeholders, has implemented targeted mosquito prevention and control measures. They continuously strengthen efforts under their purview, primarily focusing on environmental management to reduce mosquito breeding sites, supplemented by biological and chemical methods to kill mosquito larvae or adult, as well as eliminating adult mosquitoes in their habitats (such as dense bushes) by conducting fogging operations. The FEHD also provides technical advice and guidance to reduce the number of Aedes albopictus in densely populated areas, thereby lowering the risk of diseases transmitted by these mosquitoes. The gravidtrap indices in the seven surveyed areas have also shown a decline.

 To prevent the spread of CF, the FEHD has actively implementing the following mosquito control measures:


Convening special meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to co-ordinate frontline departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito control, and to allocate resources to carry out targeted and sustained mosquito control actions based on the gravidtrap index and locations with higher risks;
Enhancing inspections at construction sites, works areas and private residences. Enforcement actions will be taken against violations involving mosquito breeding;
Collaborating with departments such as the Housing Department (HD) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to strengthen inspections in public areas, public housing estates and parks. Upon detection of mosquito breeding grounds, immediate actions will be taken;
Inviting the HD and property management companies to conduct mosquito control campaigns in housing estates and encourages resident participation;
Working with the District Offices to assist in mosquito prevention and control at locations with infestation issues, such as ""three-nil"" buildings;
Issuing letters to the property management and pest control industry to remind them the implementation of mosquito prevention and control measures, and organising seminars to disseminate the latest information on CFand mosquito prevention;
Strengthening public education and publicity through promotional videos, posters and leaflets to remind the public to adopt mosquito control measures; and
Enhancing dissemination of the Area Gravidtrap Index for Aedes albopictus to raise awareness among citizens in districts with higher readings.


âIn addition to the introduction of effective mosquito prevention and control measures by the FEHD, Link and the Hong Kong General Building Contractors Association also shared experience on mosquito prevention by slideshows. Participants will continue to motivate their members and staff to enhance mosquito prevention and control measures after the meeting, as well as to display the Government's publicity and education materials at their venues.

 Representatives from different sectors (including markets/licensed hawkers, property management, catering, construction, hotels and camping) presented mosquito prevention and control measures in the meeting, and expressed they will share the relevant information with other stakeholders.

 The effectiveness of mosquito control relies on the concerted efforts and active participation of stakeholders from various sectors, including pest control operators in both public and private sectors, venue management and the general public. The Government will continue to collaborate with stakeholders and the industry to prevent CF.

 The meeting, chaired by Miss Wong, was attended by representatives from 18 organisations or institutions, including:

(a) stakeholders participating regularly: The Hong Kong Housing Society, Link, People's Place, the Hong Kong Property Services Alliance, the Hong Kong Association of Property Management Companies, the Hong Kong Association of Property Services Agents, the Hong Kong Institute of Housing, the Pest Control Personnel Association of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Pest Management Association, the Federation of Hong Kong, Kowloon, New Territories Hawker Associations, the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, the Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management, the Institute of Dining Professionals, the Association of Restaurant Managers, the Hong Kong Japanese Food and Cuisine Association, the Hong Kong General Building Contractors Association; and

Booking arrangements for Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles to be enhanced to provide convenience for flexible travel,2025-08-01 21:28,2025-08-01 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100928.htm," The Transport Department (TD) announced today (August 1) that, to provide convenience to members of the public in travelling under Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles (the Scheme) more flexibly, the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong have after discussion mutually agreed to enhance the booking arrangements for travelling under the Scheme.

 A spokesman for the TD said, ""From September 1, 2025 onwards, bookings will not be required for vehicles travelling to Guangdong Province via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) under the Scheme on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, except specified dates. Booking is required on specified dates, including Hong Kong or Mainland public holidays and the day before, toll-free days of the HZMB and other dates specified by the authority. Booking is also required on Mondays and Thursdays to Sundays. The Scheme's eligibility, application procedures and balloting remain unchanged.""

 The TD will update the website later to set out dates in the coming six months when bookings are not required. Dates in the following month when bookings are not required will be announced on the first calendar day of each month via the Specified Dates Booking System for applicants' reference. Existing arrangements of accepting bookings for specified dates in the following month from the 15th calendar day of each month will also remain unchanged.

 Of note, travellers planning to travel on specified dates are required to complete the reservation before noon on the day before travel via the Specified Dates Booking System, so that they may travel during the reserved time slot. To ensure the Scheme's smooth operations, if any vehicle is found travelling on specified dates without prior reservation, travelling beyond the reserved time slot or absent after booking, the TD will strictly enforce the penalty, including suspension of its booking eligibility for a period of time, revocation of its Closed Road Permit (CRP), or even suspension of the CRP holder's eligibility to re-apply for the Scheme.

 The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong will continue to monitor the Scheme's operations and maintain close liaison to review and enhance its arrangements in a timely manner. Applicants may refer to the Scheme's thematic website (www.hzmbqfs.gov.hk) for details later."
Health Bureau responds to enquiries regarding Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme,2025-08-01 21:18,2025-08-01 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100915.htm,"  In response to media enquiries regarding the Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme, the Health Bureau provides the following response today (August 1):

  The Government launched the three-year CDCC Pilot Scheme in November 2023, subsidising Hong Kong residents aged 45 or above without diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) or hypertension (HT) to be paired with family doctors for DM and HT screening services in the private healthcare market to achieve the policy objective of ""early prevention, early identification and early treatment"". In March this year, the Pilot Scheme was expanded to include blood lipid testing, achieving full coverage of the ""three highs"". Participants diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT, or hyperlipidaemia after screening can proceed to the treatment phase and will be subsidised by the Government to continue their treatment with a family doctor of their choice, and subject to their health conditions, be provided with prescribed medication and dedicated nurse clinic and allied health services. The Pilot Scheme reinforces the ""Family Doctor for All"" concept and expands the community healthcare network through the District Health Centres (DHCs)/DHC Expresses as resources hubs.

  The CDCC Pilot Scheme has been well received since its launch. Halfway through its three-year pilot phase, over 140000 citizens have already enrolled (as of July 23, 2025), and the number of participants continues to rise. It is expected that the target of having around 200 000 participants during the pilot period can be achieved earlier than expected. Currently, among the approximately 35 600 participants diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT, or hyperlipidaemia, over 95 per cent of them had chosen to continue receiving follow-up treatments from their family doctors.

  The Government commissioned a local university in the first quarter of 2024 to conduct a study to assess the progress in meeting various targets and the overall performance of the Pilot Scheme. Preliminary analysis indicated that participants' health conditions improved overall after receiving health counseling and medical treatment under the Pilot Scheme. Statistics revealed that after six months of participating in the Scheme, the average glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of participants diagnosed with DM dropped by about 1.0 per cent, while the average systolic blood pressure of participants diagnosed with HT decreased by about 15.0 mmHg. The findings demonstrated the positive effects of continual health management and professional support on disease control. The study team recruited a total of 614 participants from 18 DHCs/DHC Expresses for a questionnaire survey. Survey results showed that participants were satisfied with the Pilot Scheme; the overall satisfaction score was 82.5 (out of 100), and the satisfaction score towards the first family doctor consultation service was 76 (out of 100). Furthermore, in terms of HT and DM management, 96.1 per cent of participants with HT and 98.0 per cent of participants with DM reported imrpovements in self-health management capabilities.

  To address the primary healthcare needs of the underprivileged groups, the Government expanded the CDCC Pilot Scheme to selected General Out-patient Clinics (GOPCs) under the Hospital Authority (HA) in phases since late March this year, providing screening and management services of the ""three highs"" (DM, HT and hyperlipidaemia) for the underprivileged groups (including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above, or holders of valid Certificate for Waiver of Medical Charges). The first phase of the service was launched in seven GOPCs in late March 2025 and extended to 14 GOPCs in the end of June 2025 to provide the relevant services. The Government and the HA are planning to extend the services to have GOPCs in all 18 districts to provide the relevant services by the end of this year.

  The Government is reviewing the Pilot Scheme's effectiveness and optimisation strategies, and will expand the Scheme based on the experience gained from the pilot phase, with a view to deepening the initiative by transforming it into a CDCC Platform. The Government will use hepatitis B screening and management as a pilot arrangement, leveraging the Platform to further expand and integrate primary healthcare services, and gradually extend it to cover more types of chronic diseases having regard to considerations such as scientific evidence and resource utilisation. More health empowerment elements and preventive care programmes will also be added to establish a more systematic and coherent integrated primary healthcare community network."

Honourable Consul General Ong Siew Gay (Consul General of Singapore in Hong Kong),Chairman Lawrence Chia (Chairman, Singapore Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong)), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. I'm honoured to be here at the SG60 Gala Dinner organised by the Singapore Chamber of Commerce (Hong Kong) to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Singapore.

This year also marks the 35thanniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Singapore and China. This milestone gives another meaning and significance to this year's celebration.

Just two days ago, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR Government attended Singapore's 60th National Day Reception and underlined the deep and long-standing ties that bind our two economies, our two cultures and peoples.

Hong Kong and Singapore have long enjoyed close and cordial bilateral trade and economic relations. To note, Singapore is Hong Kong's fourth-largest trading partner and our largest ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) partner in merchandise trade, as well as the fifth-largest destination of our outward investment. The fact that the Chief Executive led a high-level business delegation to Singapore two years ago highlights the importance we place on strengthening our partnership with Singapore.

Hong Kong is keen to contribute further to regional integration through our early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). We are encouraged by the favourable responses we have received from RCEP members, and we are grateful to Singapore for lending support to our formal accession request.

I look forward to much more collaboration between Hong Kong and Singapore down the road. Under the great concept of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong, being a Special Administrative Region of China, benefits from national programmes such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. At the same time, Hong Kong has been accorded the position of the ""eight centres"" in the National 14th Five-year Plan, which has opened up a whole host of new opportunities for various industries in Hong Kong, ranging from finance, I&T, trade, aviation, logistics to arts and cultures. These opportunities are not only for Hong Kong, but are also open to overseas companies - including of course Singapore companies - which can use Hong Kong as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world.

Singapore and Hong Kong bear a lot of resemblance. We are geographically small, and our population is not big. What's more is that our people are hardworking and possess characteristically good entrepreneurial spirit and a global perspective. And we are good-natured and friendly people. I have no doubt the friendship between Singapore and Hong Kong will grow stronger and stronger, for us to shine together, today and tomorrow.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take the opportunity to bid farewell, once again, to Consul-General Ong Siew Gay, who will be returning to Singapore next week. Siew Gay, you have been such a dear friend and partner, not only to the Hong Kong SAR Government but also to the whole Hong Kong community. Thank you for your immense contribution, and we wish you the best in your new journey.

Tonight, with dinner, wine, dancing and entertainment, as well as a charity auction and lucky draw, and even a supper of Singaporean hawker fare, this will surely be a night to remember.

  So, enjoy the party. Best wishes to Singapore and Singaporeans in Hong Kong! Thank you very much."

醫務衞生局回應有關「慢病共治計劃」的查詢,2025-08-01 20:02,2025-08-01 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100866.htm,"就傳媒有關「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」）的查詢，醫務衞生局今日（八月一日）回應如下：

政府在二○二三年十一月推出為期三年的「慢病共治計劃」，資助45歲或以上未被確診患有糖尿病或高血壓的香港居民，配對家庭醫生並於私營醫療市場接受糖尿病及高血壓篩查服務，以達致「早預防、早發現、早治療」的政策目標。先導計劃於今年三月擴展至包含血脂檢查，實現「三高全覆蓋」。經篩查後被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的參加者可進入治療階段，並在政府資助下由自行選擇的家庭醫生繼續為其診治，以及按個人健康狀況獲處方藥物，接受專屬護士診所和專職醫療服務。先導計劃強化「一人一家庭醫生」概念，並以地區康健中心／站為樞紐，擴闊社區醫療網絡。

「慢病共治計劃」自推出後反應良好，三年先導期一半已有超過14萬名市民參加（截至二○二五年七月二十三日）且參加人數持續上升，預料能較預期時間提早達致先導期約20萬市民參加的目標。目前被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的約35 600位參加者中，超過九成半選擇由家庭醫生繼續跟進治療。

政府已於二○二四年第一季委託本地大學進行研究，評估計劃各項目標的實現程度和整體表現。初步研究分析顯示，參加者在接受計劃安排的醫療輔導和治療後，健康狀況普遍改善。數據顯示，在參與計劃後的六個月，糖尿病患者的平均糖化血紅素（HbA1c）下降約1.0%；高血壓患者的平均收縮壓降低約15.0mmHg，反映持續健康管理和專業支援對疾病控制的積極作用。研究團隊從18間地區康健中心／站招募了614名參與者進行問卷調查。調查結果顯示，參與者對「慢病共治計劃」表現滿意，其中的整體印象評分達82.5分（滿分100分），而首次家庭醫生診症服務的評分則為76分（滿分100分）。此外，在高血壓及糖尿病管理方面，分別有96.1%的高血壓參與者及98.0%的糖尿病參與者在病人自強能力方面有所改善。

為照顧弱勢社群的基層醫療需要，政府於今年三月底分階段擴展「慢病共治計劃」至醫院管理局（醫管局）轄下指定普通科門診診所，為弱勢社群（包括綜合社會保障援助計劃受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受惠人或持有有效醫療費用減免證明書人士）提供「三高」（即高血壓、高血糖和高血脂）篩查和護理服務。首階段服務已於二○二五年三月底在七間普通科門診診所開展，並由六月底起增加至14間普通科門診診所提供相關服務。政府及醫管局計劃於今年底擴展至全港十八區均有普通科門診診所提供有關服務。

政府正展開檢討「慢病共治計劃」的成效及優化的方向，並會以先導計劃的經驗作為基礎而擴大計劃，深化發展為「慢性疾病共同治理平台」（平台）。政府將以乙型肝炎篩查治理為試點，透過平台繼續推展及整合基層醫療服務，根據科學實證和資源運用等考慮因素，逐步覆蓋更多慢性疾病病種，並加入更多健康賦能的元素和預防性護理項目，建立一個更有系統和連貫性的社區基層醫療網絡。"

​律政司司長出席物業管理業監管局「物業守護者」形象設計比賽頒獎典禮暨物業管理業持續專業發展講座致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-08-01 19:29,2025-08-01 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100788.htm,"以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（八月一日）出席物業管理業監管局「物業守護者」形象設計比賽頒獎典禮暨物業管理業持續專業發展講座的致辭：

黃江天博士（物業管理業監管局主席）、各位物管業界朋友、各位嘉賓、各位同事：

大家好，我十分高興今日出席由物業管理業監管局舉辦的「物業守護者」形象設計比賽頒獎典禮暨物業管理業持續專業發展講座。

隨着香港物管業發牌制度全面實施兩周年，我們很高興見證物管業界朝向專業化及優質化的穩步發展。今日，我亦很高興認識新朋友「物管俠」——這位形象鮮明的「代言人」可因應工作需求，化身不同角色，應對各類物管服務。這種靈活變換的設計，象徵着物管從業員因應不同需求提供適切服務的專業精神。

目前，全港已有超過15 000名持牌物管從業員，他們每天穿梭於各區樓宇之間，不僅處理日常管理事務，更需經常擔當着業主、租戶與住戶之間的溝通橋樑，協助化解各類鄰里之間的糾紛。所以我認為今日持續專業發展講座的主題非常配合物管從業員的實際工作需要。這次講座的主題是「物管業界調解樓宇糾紛」。剛剛播放完的短片非常精彩，稍後亦有幾位重量級講者參與專題論壇，分享他們的經驗和真知灼見，我希望先為大家作熱身、「開個頭」。

首先，我認為調解是特別適合處理涉及物業管理的糾紛，這是因為這類糾紛擁有以下四個特點。一是業主、租戶或住戶之間是一個長期持續的關係，不會亦不可能因爭議出現而馬上或短期內終結，簡單來說就是即使有爭執，大家仍然是左鄰右里，「朝見口、晚見面」，如何盡快解決糾紛、修補關係至為重要。事情拖得越久越難解決，因為雙方更容易變得情緒化，失去耐性，亦要為解決糾紛投放更加多時間，甚至金錢。

二是解決這類糾紛往往需要爭議雙方暫且放下對對方的不滿，互相合作。例如樓下住戶投訴樓上單位漏水，雙方都需要同意先讓對方盡早進入自己單位進行必須的檢測，以確定漏水的原因，再尋找雙方均接受的處理方式。

三是這類糾紛大部分不涉及大量金錢，甚至只是一些意氣之爭。例如住戶投訴鄰居在走廊或電梯大堂擺放大量雜物，阻礙出入、有礙觀瞻，甚至影響走火通道。這些爭議不能用錢解決，也不值得花錢解決。

四是這類爭議往往涉及並非黑白分明的簡單問題，而是經常涉及沒有清晰客觀標準的合理性問題。例如住戶投訴鄰居晚上產生噪音，是否構成違反大廈公契及一般法律原則的滋擾，取決於一籃子因素包括造成聲音的原因、音量、持續時間等等因素後，再決定是否構成不合理違法行為。

基於以上物管糾紛的特徵，顯而易見，必須採取非對抗性，經濟、快捷，鼓勵合作，同時修補關係的解決方式。傳統對抗性解決爭議方式例如訴訟或仲裁明顯不適合，相反，調解正正完全符合上述條件。

以調解解決物管糾紛並非新鮮事，早在二○○九年，土地審裁處已發出實務指引，明確鼓勵涉及建築物管理爭議的各方，無論在提出訴訟之前或之後，嘗試透過調解以消除分歧；如爭議本可以藉着比訴訟花費少又更快捷有效的途徑得以解決，而任何一方卻不合理地及不真誠地去嘗試採取此途徑，則審裁處在裁定仲費時會以此行為作為考慮因素。

律政司一直積極推廣以調解解決各類爭議， 例如「調解為先」承諾書活動已成為律政司兩年一度的盛事，旨在鼓勵公司、機構及個人簽署承諾書，承諾先考慮採用調解解決爭議，然後才嘗試其他爭議解決方法或在法庭進行訴訟。至今超過1 000間公司、機構或個人已簽署「調解為先」承諾書，當中包括19間物業管理公司和14名物業管理經理。我亦在此誠邀各位共同響應這項深具意義的倡議，加入簽署「調解為先」承諾書的行列。

更重要是二○二四年《施政報告》確立深化調解文化的長遠政策。為落實深化調解文化的施政方針，律政司聯同環境及生態局和食物環境衞生署共同推出社區調解先導計劃，特別針對物業管理人員設計社區調解培訓課程，將調解理念深入社區。在此，我要特別感謝物業管理業監管局的鼎力支持，協助招募物業管理人員參加培訓課程。計劃的首輪培訓課程已於七月七日正式啓動。

課程由認可調解員教授，內容兼具理論與實務。培訓第一部分的講座向物業管理人員教授調解的基本概念與核心原則，涵蓋調解特性及優點、調解員的角色等課題，並探討在調解過程中應用的不同技巧。課程亦有介紹社會上不同的調解計劃。若物業管理人員嘗試調解後問題依然存在，物管人員可在適當情況下轉介給合適的第三方調解機構。在培訓的第二部分，我們特別設計了情境模擬實務演練，讓學員能夠實際運用所學的調解技巧。課程精心安排了多種常見的社區糾紛案例進行模擬調解，例如住戶拒絕配合滲水初步檢查所引發的衝突，以及因水管維修問題導致的鄰里爭執等實際情境。透過這種高度互動的教學方式，學員得以在仿真的環境中，親身體驗調解過程的各個環節。

計劃自啓動以來，已成功舉辦兩期培訓，共47名人士參與。參與的物業管理人員都展現出高度熱誠，亦對培訓提供了寶貴的意見及作出非常正面的評價。我們計劃在明年三月前再舉辦多四次同樣的培訓。

當物業佔用者之間出現糾紛或對管理有不滿，一般來說，都必定首先找管理處幫忙或作投訴。物管從業員職責所在，無可避免地要嘗試扮演「和事佬」的角色。但是，我認為令物管從業員了解如何以調解方式處理物管糾紛，目的並非要訓練他們成為專業調解員，而是要令他們掌握調解技巧，以便在日常工作中運用協助解決爭議。固然，物管從業員對於相關法律，特別是《建築物管理條例》和有關物業的大廈公契必須有充分認識和理解，但這並不足夠。調解最重要的技巧之一是讓爭議雙方感覺「和事佬」是公正持平，不偏幫任何一方，這樣方能得到雙方的信任，讓他當「和事佬」主持公道，否則就會變成「兩邊不討好」。 其次，「和事佬」必須耐心聆聽雙方陳述，找出真正關鍵爭議點，盡量緩和氣氛，收窄分歧，嘗試提出實際可行解決方案供雙方考慮，將大事化小、小事化無，這需要良好的溝通技巧。

剛才短片中，黃博士提倡的調解「三心兩意」十分有意思，值得點讚。「三心」是同理心、齊心、耐心，「兩意」是誠意加創意。但我比較多心，再送多三個「心」給你們，就是信心、放心和開心。首先，律政司和其他相關部門和團體必定會積極合力提供高質培訓，增加物管從業員處理物管糾紛的信心；大家有信心，必然能更有效履行職責，這樣所有業主、租戶與住戶對物業管理都一定會更放心；自自然然，大家都會在同一大廈或屋苑內不論工作或生活都會變得更開心。

在香港這個崇尚法治的社會，解決物業管理糾紛最終必須依據法律辦事，但要處理的實在是有着密切關連人與人之間的關係。所謂「遠親不如近鄰」，鄰里間和睦相處、保持良好關係十分重要，調解是以「人性化、和為貴、向前看」的原則，修補及維持這一特殊持久關係。我對各位物管從業員充滿信心，相信必定能肩負重任，協助建造一個更和諧的社會和香港。最後，我祝願各位今天能滿載而歸，工作順利，身體健康。謝謝。"
反非法勞工行動拘十六人（附圖）,2025-08-01 18:45,2025-08-01 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100765.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於七月二十八日至昨日（七月三十一日）一連四日在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，分別是代號「促進行動」、「機靈行動」和「曙光行動」，與及聯同香港警務處執行的「風沙行動」。行動中共拘捕十五名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

入境處特遣隊人員在反非法勞工行動中搜查了一百二十八個目標地點，包括工業大廈、住宅單位及餐廳，共拘捕九名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為七男兩女，年齡介乎二十七歲至五十五歲。當中一名女子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為一名五十四歲女子。

此外，在「曙光行動」中，入境處調查人員於網上巡邏期間發現觀塘一間食肆懷疑安排旅客表演舞蹈及雜技，隨即派員於七月二十八日展開行動，在他們於該餐廳進行表演時將其拘捕。被捕的非法勞工為兩男四女，均為內地訪客，年齡介乎二十至二十五歲。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
16 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-08-01 18:45,2025-08-01 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100748.htm,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Contribute"", ""Greenlane"" and ""Twilight"", and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Windsand"", for four consecutive days from July 28 to yesterday (July 31). A total of 15 suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested.

During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD Task Force officers raided 128 target locations including industrial buildings, residential apartments and restaurants. Nine suspected illegal workers and one suspected employerwere arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised seven men and two women, aged 27 to 55. Among them, one woman was a holder of a recognisance form, which prohibits her from taking any employment. One woman, aged 54, was suspected of employing the illegal worker and was also arrested.

 In addition, during operation ""Twilight"", ImmD investigators found during a cyber patrol that a restaurant was allegedly offering dance and acrobatic performances by visitors. Investigators initiated an operation on July 28 immediately and arrested the suspects while they were performing at the restaurant. The arrested illegal workers comprised two men and four women, aged 20 to 25, all Mainland visitors.

An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."

 This press release summarises the decisions of the Communications Authority (CA) following its 144thmeeting held in July 2025.

CA approves renewal application for non-domestic television programme service (non-domestic TV) licence from WarnerMedia Asia Pacific (HK) Limited
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The CA approved the application from WarnerMedia Asia Pacific (HK) Limited for renewal of its non-domestic TV licence for 12 years, from October 1, 2025, to September 30, 2037 (both dates inclusive). Currently, there are nine non-domestic TV licensees providing around 150 satellite television programme channels for the Asia-Pacific region.

CA accepts commitments offered by China Mobile Hong Kong Company Limited (CMHK) in relation to proposed acquisition of HKBN Ltd by CMHK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The CA announced today (August 1) its decision to accept the commitments offered by CMHK in relation to the proposed acquisition of HKBN Ltd by CMHK (Proposed Transaction), and not to commence an investigation under the Competition Ordinance (Cap. 619) (CO).

 CMHK announced the Proposed Transaction on December 2, 2024, which falls within the scope of the Merger Rule under the CO. After conducting a competition assessment of the Proposed Transaction, the CA identified a competition issue on fixed local access network that would likely arise from the Proposed Transaction, and communicated such concern to CMHK.

 In May 2025, CMHK offered a set of commitments to the CA to address the potential competition concern arising from the Proposed Transaction (Proposed Commitments). On May 29, 2025, the CA issued a notice inviting representations from the industry and interested parties regarding its intended acceptance of the Proposed Commitments. Among others, a concern about mobile backhauls was raised by the industry in their representations. In response, CMHK offered a set of revised commitments to the CA (Revised Commitments). Having carefully considered the representations received, the Revised Commitments offered by CMHK and all relevant information, the CA is satisfied that the Revised Commitments are sufficient to effectively address the potential competition concerns arising from the Proposed Transaction. Therefore, the CA has decided to accept the Revised Commitments and not to commence an investigation on the Proposed Transaction. For more details on the CA's decision, please refer to the CA Statement released today."

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2025-08-01 17:55,2025-08-01 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100717.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 1) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases and updated the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF). Due to the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, mosquito infestation might be aggravated in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public travel more frequently during summer holidays to regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. As a result, the risks of imported cases and local transmission of mosquito-borne diseases increase.

Dengue fever

From July 25 to yesterday (July 31), the CHP recorded three imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to India, the Philippines and Thailand respectively during the incubation periods.

As of yesterday, 36 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases. In 2023, 62 imported cases of DF were recorded.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 308 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 102 cases were recorded in a week between July 21 and 27, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Yunfu, Foshan and Zhongshan.

Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Chikungunya fever

From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases. There have been no CF cases in Hong Kong since 2020.

According to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of early June this year, over 220 000 cases had been reported in 14 countries/regions worldwide (including the Mainland, Taiwan and Singapore which are popular tourist destinations for Hong Kong citizens). Of these cases, about 80 were fatal. Moreover, according to the information from the Foshan health authority, as of July 30 there were over 6 500 cases. The majority of cases (5 660 cases) were in Shunde District. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases. As well, confirmed cases were also recorded in other cities in Guangdong Province recently. Regarding Macao, six imported cases of CF were recorded since mid-July, and four of them travelled to Foshan city during the incubation periods.

Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been carrying out joint prevention and control of communicable disease involving the three places in accordance with the well-established liaison and communication mechanism. The CHP will continue to work closely with the health authorities in Guangdong Province and Macao, and will take appropriate preventive and control measures according to risk assessment to prevent the spread of CF in Hong Kong and protect public health.

""Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are the most effective measures to protect against mosquito-borne diseases. Members of the public returning from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. Members of the public should closely observe personal health conditions, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrange appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage,"" said the Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au.

The CHP held the first online live seminar yesterday (July 31), to provide the latest information and health advice on CF, and respond to related enquiries from the public. The CHP will hold the second online seminar next week on its Facebook page to talk about anti-mosquito measures and mosquito proliferation. Details will be announced later on the CHP's social media accounts. Members of public are welcome to attend.

The CHP has issued letters to all schools and institutions (including residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities) in Hong Kong to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and remind operators to adopt preventive measures to avoid mosquito bites.

Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:

Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxesin covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Install mosquito screens on windows and doors if necessary, or use mosquito screens or nets in indoor areas;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.


The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the chikungunya fever page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram Account andYouTube Channel."
環境及生態局就近期基孔肯雅熱的情況與業界會面（附圖）,2025-08-01 17:55,2025-08-01 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100636.htm,"環境及生態局（環境局）今日（八月一日）就防治蚊蟲事宜與業界代表會面，分享基孔肯雅熱的最新情況及應對措施，加強政商民合作，推動業界積極落實防治蚊患措施，以保障市民健康。

環境局一直關注基孔肯雅熱的最新發展及有關的防控工作，與各決策局及部門和業界持份者通力合作，積極跟進防治蚊患的工作。環境局局長謝展寰今日早上，於會議前先連同食物環境衞生署（食環署）助理署長（行動）潘炳揚及相關部門代表，到將軍澳的寶林邨、寶翠公園及附近一帶，視察地區加強預防基孔肯雅熱的工作。

今日視察的監察地區曾於今年五月錄得誘蚊器指數達第三級警戒級別，代表白紋伊蚊分布廣泛。食環署已聯同相關部門及持份者持續在各自管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊子滋生地、施放殺幼蟲劑、以霧化處理方式殺滅成蚊，以及確保在適當位置設置的捕蚊器妥善運作等。該監察地區其後六月及七月的誘蚊器指數已回落至較低的第二級別。

環境局副局長黃淑嫻聯同衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）人員及食環署人員今日下午與業界代表會面。會上，中心向與會者介紹基孔肯雅熱最新情況、香港以外地方的情況、內地與香港聯防聯控工作，以及香港的風險評估、口岸防控、應急準備及宣傳教育等工作。

食環署亦向與會者匯報最新誘蚊器指數的情況，截至今年七月，白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數曾在六月份錄得9.5%，較二○二三年及二○二四年同期（分別為16.4%及14.0%）為低，整體保持較低水平。在今年一月一日至七月三十一日期間，64個監察地區中，有七個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數曾高於百分之二十，達第三級的警戒級別，表示該監察地區白紋伊蚊的分布廣泛。因應誘蚊器調查結果，食環署已聯同相關部門及持份者採取針對性防蚊滅蚊措施，持續在各自管轄範圍內加強工作，主要以環境防治為基礎以減少蚊子滋生的地點，並輔以生物及化學方式殺滅蚊子幼蟲或成蚊，亦會在成蚊棲息地（例如茂密的叢林）進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，食環署並會提供技術意見及指導，以減低白紋伊蚊在人流密集地方的數量，從而減低經由白紋伊蚊傳播疾病的風險。該七個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數亦見回落。

為防範基孔肯雅熱的傳播，食環署積極採取以下防控蚊患措施：


在各分區召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」特別會議，協調前線部門及各持份者加強滅蚊，根據指數或風險較高的地點，調配資源採取具針對性和持久性的防蚊滅蚊行動；
加強巡查建築地盤及工地，以及私人住宅，對發現蚊子滋生的違規情況採取執法行動；
聯同房屋署及康樂及文化事務署等不同部門在公共地方、公共屋邨、公園等加強巡查，如發現蚊子滋生地，會即時採取行動；
邀請房屋署及物業管理公司在屋邨及屋苑進行滅蚊運動，並鼓勵居民參與；
聯同各區民政事務處，協助有蚊蟲滋生情況的地方如三無大廈進行防蚊滅蚊工作；
已向物業管理及防治蟲鼠業界發信，提醒業界落實防治蚊患的措施，以及通過舉辦講座，向業界講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況及防蚊資訊；
持續加強公眾教育及宣傳，通過宣傳短片、海報及單張等途徑，提醒市民採取措施防治蚊患；及
加強發布各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，提高指數較高地區市民的防蚊意識。


此外，除食環署介紹有效的防治蚊患措施外，領展及香港建築業承建商聯會亦透過其投影片分享其防治蚊患的實戰經驗。與會者在會後將繼續推動其會員及員工做好防治蚊患措施，以及讓政府的宣傳教育資料在其場地展示。

來自不同界別（包括街市／持牌小販、物業管理、餐飲業、建造業、酒店業及營舍業等）的業界代表，在會議上介紹防蚊滅蚊工作，並表示會與其持份者分享有關資料。

防治蚊患要做得好，實有賴各界的持份者，包括公營和私營機構的防治蟲鼠從業人員、場地管理者及市民大眾的通力合作和積極參與。政府會繼續聯同各持份者及業界攜手合作，防範基孔肯雅熱。

是次會議由黃淑嫻主持，共有18個組織或機構參與，包括：

（一）恆常參與的持份者：香港房屋協會、領展、民坊、香港物業服務聯盟、香港物業管理公司協會、香港物業服務公司協會、香港房屋經理學會、香港蟲害控制從業員協會、香港殺蟲業協會、港九新界販商社團聯合會、香港餐飲聯業協會、香港餐務管理協會、稻苗飲食專業學會、現代管理（飲食）專業協會、香港日本食品及料理業協會、香港建築業承建商聯會；以及

HKSAR Government opposes smears by EU against Police's lawful enforcement actions,2025-08-01 17:38,2025-08-01 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100697.htm," The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (August 1) strongly opposes and disapproves of the slanderous remarks by the European Union (EU) on the HKSAR's lawful act to pursue wanted persons who have endangered national security and absconded from Hong Kong.

 A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. No country will watch with folded arms on acts and activities that endanger national security. The 'Hong Kong Parliament' is an organisation that aims to subvert state power; its objectives include promoting 'self-determination', promulgating the so-called 'Hong Kong Constitution', and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People's Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of the central power of the People's Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR with unlawful means, thereby suspected of committing the offence of 'Subversion' contrary to Article 22 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). Thus, the Police applied to the court for arrest warrants in accordance with the law and placed the persons on a wanted list. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts, including those involving collusion with foreign or external forces, is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.

 ""Extraterritorial effect for offences under the HKNSL and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Hong Kong Police are duty-bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security outside Hong Kong. Those absconders hiding outside Hong Kong are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security. Moreover, they continue to collude with external forces to cover for their evil deeds. It is necessary for the Police to take all lawful measures to strongly combat the acts of abscondment, and such actions are fully justified, necessary and legitimate.

 ""We have to stress that both the HKNSL and the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press and of publication, and the freedoms of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, enjoyed by Hong Kong people under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applicable to the HKSAR are protected in accordance with the law.Nonetheless, just as in other places in the world, many of the rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that certain rights and freedoms including the freedom of expression may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for the protection of national security, public safety, public order, the rights and freedoms of others, etc. Regarding an extremely small minority of organisations and individuals endangering national security, the HKSAR Government will not condone their criminal acts and will not give up pursuing them, including adopting all practical measures to bring those fugitives endangering national security who have absconded from Hong Kong to justice.""

 The spokesman emphasised, ""Absconders should not think they can evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong. Ultimately, they will be held liable for their acts constituting serious offences endangering national security and be punished by the law. No country or organisation should harbour criminals nor try to exonerate these people with different excuses.""

 The spokesman reiterated,""The HKSAR Government will, as always, resolutely, fully and faithfully implement theHKNSL, the SNSO and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, while upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people in accordance with the law, to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly demands that the EU immediately stop acting against international law and basic norms of international relationsand interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs."""

中心發言人說：「中心透過恆常食物監測計劃，從屯門新墟街市一檔戶抽取上述樣本進行檢測，結果顯示樣本含有橙黃二。中心已知會涉事檔戶上述違規事項，並指令其停售有關食品。」

發言人續說：「橙黃二是一種工業染料，常用於羊毛、皮革、紙張和化妝品，是本港法例不准在食物中使用的染色料。」

根據《食物內染色料規例》（第132H章），擬供出售給人食用的食物，不得含有並非准許染色料的添加染色料。違例者一經定罪，最高可處罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。

The CFS is following up on the incident.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a stall at San Hui Market in Tuen Mun for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained Orange II. The CFS has informed the stall concerned of the above-mentioned irregularity and instructed it to stop selling the food product concerned.""

  ""Orange II, an industrial dye commonly used in wool, leather, paper and cosmetic products, is not permitted to be used in food in Hong Kong,"" the spokesman added.

According to the Colouring Matter in Food Regulations (Cap. 132H), no food intended for sale for human consumption shall contain any added colouring matter which is not a permitted colouring matter. Offenders may be liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment upon conviction.

The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. An investigation is ongoing."

"Interactive multimedia theatre ""Home"" from Netherlands to stage in August (with photos)",2025-08-01 17:28,2025-08-01 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100592.htm,"  The International Arts Carnival (IAC), a summer arts festival organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, will stage the interactive multimedia theatre ""Home"" by Mime Wave from the Netherlands in August. Combining theatre, animation and music, the programme leads audiences of all ages to explore the true meaning of home in a heartwarming story.

 ""Home"" is inspired by the creator Anastasiia's own journey from Ukraine to the Netherlands. The story revolves around Anastasiia and her dog Djonnik, whose house is carried away by a storm. While searching for a new home, they meet and listen to stories of a number of animal friends, including a giraffe living in a skyscraper and a penguin in an ice house, and eventually discover the true meaning of home. Through engaging storytelling, vibrant animation and gentle music, audiences are encouraged to reflect on home not being about just four walls, but also as an irreplaceable bond in everyone's heart.

 The performance schedule is as follows:

Date and time: August 9 (Saturday), 2.30pm and 4.30pm
           *August 10 (Sunday), 11am and 3pm
Place:       Hong Kong Cultural Centre Studio Theatre
Ticket price:  $320 (free seating)

* For the more relaxed performances on August 10, lighting and sound will be adjusted to a softer level. The house rules will also be relaxed, allowing audience members to make noise and freely enter or exit the theatre at any time during the show. A designated chill-out area outside the theatre will be available for those who need a break.

Date and time: August 16 (Saturday), 2.30pm and 4.30pm
Place:       Sha Tin Town Hall Cultural Activities Hall
Ticket price:  $280 and $320

二○二五年第二季中小企貸款狀況調查,2025-08-01 17:06,2025-08-01 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100692.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（八月一日）公布二○二五年第二季「中小企貸款狀況調查」結果。調查顯示，中小企信貸狀況大致保持穩定。

關於中小企對銀行貸款批核取態（即難易程度）的觀感，撇除回答「沒意見／不知道」的受訪者，65%認為銀行在二○二五年第二季貸款批核的取態與六個月前相比「沒有分別」或「較容易」，低於前一季的75%（附件圖1）。35%認為銀行的有關取態「較困難」，而上一季度則為25%。貸款較困難的觀感並不一定反映中小企在借貸上遇到實質困難，而是可以受多項因素（如媒體／新聞報道、生意經營狀況及親友的意見等）所影響。

在已獲批貸款的受訪者中，1%表示銀行對其貸款的取態有所「收緊」，較前一季的5%下降（附件圖2）。在本調查中，貸款收緊的含義包括各種可能，例如降低備用信貸額和貸款額、信貸利率上升、增加抵押品要求或縮短貸款年期等。因此，受訪者表示銀行對其貸款的取態並不直接反映銀行實際對中小企的貸款投放。

調查亦收集有關中小企新貸款申請的結果。3%受訪者表示曾於二○二五年第二季向銀行申請新貸款。在已知申請結果的受訪者中，表示申請完全成功或部分成功的受訪者佔67%，低於前一季的79%（附件圖3）。

由於季內有已獲批貸款的中小企及有申請新貸款的中小企數目較少，分別僅佔受訪中小企的16%及3%，調查結果容易出現較大波動，詮釋時需要注意。

關於「中小企貸款狀況調查」

鑑於中小企對香港經濟的重要性，以及過去幾年中小企可能面對融資困難，金管局委託香港生產力促進局由二○一六年第三季起進行是項調查。調查按季進行，每次涵蓋約2 500間不同行業的中小企。調查結果有助從需求角度了解中小企獲得銀行貸款的狀況。

讀者需要小心詮釋調查結果。正如其他意見調查一樣，調查期間可能會出現特殊事件影響到受訪者的觀感，令調查結果變得波動。讀者在詮釋調查結果時應同時參考其他經濟及金融資訊。此外，收集所得意見僅反映受訪者對不同季度之間預期變動的趨勢（例如「收緊」、「沒有改變」或「放寬」），而並非具體變動的幅度。

本調查詳細列表及技術資料，載於香港生產力促進局網站（smecc.hkpc.org）。"
Survey on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' Credit Conditions for Second Quarter 2025,2025-08-01 17:06,2025-08-01 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100694.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (August 1) the results of the Survey on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)' Credit Conditions for the second quarter of 2025. According to the survey, SMEs' credit conditions remained broadly stable.

Regarding SMEs' perception of banks' credit approval stance relative to 6 months ago, excluding respondents who answered ""no idea/don't know"", 65 per cent perceived a ""similar"" or ""easier"" credit approval stance in the second quarter of 2025, down from 75 per cent in the previous quarter (Chart 1in the Annex). 35 per cent perceived a ""more difficult"" credit approval stance, compared to 25 per cent in the previous quarter. The perception of a more difficult credit approval stance may not necessarily reflect actual difficulties faced by SMEs in obtaining bank credit as the perception could be affected by a number of factors, such as media/news reports, business conditions and opinions of relatives and friends.

Among respondents with existing credit lines, 1 per cent reported a ""tighter"" banks' stance, down from 5 per cent in the previous quarter (Chart 2in the Annex). In this survey, a tighter stance on existing credit lines denotes a range of possible measures or arrangements, such as reducing unused and used credit lines, raising the interest rate, imposing additional collateral requirements, or shortening loan tenor. Therefore, respondents' indication of banks' stance on existing credit lines may not directly reflect banks' supply of credit to SMEs.

The survey also gauged the results of new credit applications from SMEs. 3 per cent of the respondents reported that they had applied for new bank credit during the second quarter of 2025. Among the respondents who had already known their application outcomes, 67 per cent reported fully or partially successful applications, down from 79 per cent in the previous quarter (Chart 3in the Annex).

Owing to small sample sizes of SMEs with existing credit lines (16 per cent of surveyed SMEs) and with new credit applications (3 per cent of surveyed SMEs) during the quarter, the results could be prone to large fluctuations, and hence should be interpreted with care.

About Survey on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)' Credit Conditions

In light of the importance of SMEs to the Hong Kong economy and concerns about potential funding difficulties facing SMEs over the past few years, the HKMA has appointed the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) to carry out this survey, starting from the third quarter of 2016. This survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, covering about 2 500 SMEs from different economic sectors each time. The results of this survey can help monitor the development of SMEs' access to bank credit from a demand-side perspective.

The results of this survey should be interpreted with caution. Similar to other opinion surveys, views collected in this survey may be affected by changes in sentiment due to idiosyncratic events that occurred over the survey period, which can make the results prone to fluctuations. Readers are advised to interpret the results together with other economic and financial information. In addition, views collected are limited to the expected direction of inter-quarter changes (e.g. ""tighter"", ""no change"" or ""easier"") without providing information about the magnitude of these changes.

Detailed tables and technical information of this survey are published on the website of the HKPC (smecc.hkpc.org)."
蚊傳疾病登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況,2025-08-01 17:00,2025-08-01 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100612.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月一日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字和基孔肯雅熱最新情況。由於在夏季期間氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況可能會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往蚊傳疾病流行的地區，因此出現蚊傳疾病輸入個案及本地傳播的風險有所增加。

登革熱

由七月二十五日至昨日（七月三十一日），中心錄得三宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內分別曾到印度、菲律賓和泰國。

截至昨日，今年錄得36宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。二○二三年則錄得62宗外地傳入個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過二萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得308宗本地感染病例，於七月二十一日至二十七日的一周內已錄得102宗，其中以廣州、雲浮、佛山和中山錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

基孔肯雅熱

本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至十一宗個案，全部為外地傳入個案。由二○二○年至今，沒有錄得確診基孔肯雅熱的個案。

世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱個案。截至今年六月初，全球14個國家／地區共錄得超過22萬宗個案（包括內地、台灣、新加坡等香港人的旅遊熱點），當中約80宗為死亡個案。另外，根據佛山衞生當局資訊，截至七月三十日佛山市已錄得超過6 500宗個案，絕大部分個案在順德區錄得（5 660宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。此外，廣東省其他城市近日亦出現確診個案。澳門方面，自今年七月中起共錄得六宗基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，其中四名患者於潛伏期內曾到佛山市。

粵港澳三地一直按照行之有效的聯絡溝通機制，對涉及三地的傳染病進行聯防聯控工作。中心會繼續和廣東省、澳門的衞生當局保持緊密聯繫，按照風險評估採取適當的防控措施，預防基孔肯雅熱在本港傳播，保障市民健康。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生說：「不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施，防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防蚊傳疾病的最佳方法。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。」

中心於昨日（七月三十一日）舉行首場網上直播講座，講解有關基孔肯雅熱的最新資訊及健康建議，並回應市民的相關查詢。中心下星期會在Facebook專頁舉行第二場網上直播講座，講述防蚊措施及蚊患情況。詳情稍後會於中心的社交媒體帳號公布，歡迎市民參與。

中心已就基孔肯雅熱去信全港學校及院舍（包括安老院舍及殘疾人士院舍），以提供最新流行病學資訊，並提醒負責人採取預防措施以防止蚊子叮咬。

市民應繼續採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
如有需要，可於門窗裝上防蚊網，或在室內地方使用隔蚊簾或蚊帳；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。

Public housing resident convicted by court for making false statements,2025-08-01 17:00,2025-08-01 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100360.htm,"A public rental housing (PRH) resident was suspected of contravening the Housing Ordinance and was charged with three counts of making a false statement, including falsely declaring that she did not own any property. The woman was convicted in Fanling Magistrates' Courts on July 30 and was sentenced to fines and imprisonment, a spokesman for the Housing Department (HD) said today (August 1).

The PRH resident living in Yung Shing Court in Fanling failed to declare in the Income and Assets Declaration Forms in 2022 that she owned landed property in Hong Kong. Furthermore, she declared in her application for Sale of Home Ownership Scheme Flats in 2023 that she did not have any domestic property in Hong Kong. An investigation by the HD revealed that she had owned a domestic property in Tai Po and a non-residential property in Tuen Mun at the material time. The HD recovered the subject PRH flat in March 2024.

Having considered the gravity of the offence and the precious PRH resources involved, the PRH resident was convicted of three charges amounting to a total fine of $54,000, plus imprisonment for two months (suspended for 12 months) on each of the charges, to run concurrently.

PRH residents are reminded that households living in PRH, as well as those applying for subsidised housing, should dutifully declare all their income, assets, and properties. All PRH households should accurately complete their Income and Assets Declaration Forms, read the content and completion guidelines of the Declaration Forms carefully and compute their income and assets in accordance with the methods specified.

The HD will continue to adopt multipronged measures to combat the abuse of PRH in a comprehensive manner."

Provisional statistics of restaurant receipts and purchases for second quarter of 2025,2025-08-01 16:30,2025-08-01 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100383.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released the latest provisional figures on restaurant receipts and purchases today (August 1).

  The value of total receipts of the restaurants sector in the second quarter of 2025, provisionally estimated at $27.1 billion, increased by 0.8% over a year earlier. Over the same period, the provisional estimate of the value of total purchases by restaurants increased by 2.7% to $8.8 billion.

  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total restaurant receipts decreased by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2025 compared with a year earlier.

  Analysed by type of restaurant and comparing the second quarter of 2025 with the second quarter of 2024, total receipts of Chinese restaurants decreased by 3.8% in value and 5.2% in volume. Total receipts of non-Chinese restaurants increased by 5.7% in value and 5.1% in volume. Total receipts of fast food shops increased by 2.1% in value and 0.7% in volume. Total receipts of bars decreased by 2.5% in value and 4.1% in volume. As for miscellaneous eating and drinking places, total receipts decreased by 0.7% in value and 2.6% in volume.

  Based on the seasonally adjusted series, the provisional estimate of total restaurant receipts increased by 0.2% in value and 0.6% in volume in the second quarter of 2025 compared with the preceding quarter.

  Comparing the first half of 2025 with the same period in 2024, total restaurant receipts increased by 0.1% in value but decreased by 1.1% in volume.

  To facilitate further understanding of the short-term business performance of the restaurants sector, statistics in respect of the restaurant receipts and purchases in individual months of the reference quarter are also compiled.

  Analysed by month, it was provisionally estimated that the value of total receipts of the restaurants sector increased by 0.9%, increased by 1.8% and decreased by 0.5% respectively in April, May and June 2025, compared with the corresponding months in 2024.

  After discounting the effect of price changes, it was provisionally estimated that the volume of total restaurant receipts decreased by 0.2%, increased by 0.7% and decreased by 1.6% respectively in April, May and June 2025, compared with the corresponding months in 2024.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that restaurant receipts resumed a mild increase in the second quarter of 2025. The value of total restaurant receipts increased by 0.8% over a year earlier, or by 0.2% over the preceding quarter on a seasonally adjusted comparison.

  Looking ahead, domestic consumption sentiment will continue to be supported by the continued growth of the economy, increase in employment earnings, and the buoyant local stock market. The Government's proactive efforts in promoting tourism and mega events should also benefit the business.

  Compared with the grading released last week, Clear Water Bay First Beach, Middle Bay Beach and Silverstrand Beach have been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

The theme for this year's Conference was ""The sustainable skies of the Asia-Pacific region: towards increased economic prosperity and social well-being by air transportation of people and goods in the region"". The five-day Conference, with over 350 participants from 47 member states, administrations and international organisations, concluded on a high note today (August 1). Discussion and information papers covering a wide range of subjects, including aviation safety, air navigation, aviation security, aviation and the environment, aviation technologies, as well as regional co-operation were submitted by aviation authorities and industry organisations to the Conference.

Among the three papers submitted to the Conference by the CAD, one of them was themed ""Development of Low-Altitude Economy"" to share Hong Kong's efforts of leveraging advanced air mobility technologies to develop the low-altitude economy in Hong Kong while safeguarding aviation and public safety. The other two papers presented the CAD's experiences in upholding aviation safety and aviation security requirements for sustainable air cargo operations, and discussed the collaborative achievements in the commissioning of the Three-Runway System at Hong Kong International Airport to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the aerodrome remained unaffected throughout the project. The papers received recognition and support from delegates.

During their stay in Sendai, the CAD delegation attended side meetings with representatives from different aviation authorities and industry organisations such as the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Airports Council International and the International Air Transport Association. Views on matters of mutual interest were shared, and ways to strengthen co-operation were explored with the aim of facilitating aviation developments.

The CAD will continue to maintain close co-operation with its aviation partners and continue to support the ICAO's global aviation development initiatives."

特區政府發言人表示：「危害國家安全是嚴重的罪行，沒有國家會對危害國家安全的行為和活動袖手旁觀。『香港議會』是一個旨在顛覆國家政權的組織，其目標包括推動『自決』、制定所謂『香港憲法』，以非法手段推翻、破壞《中華人民共和國憲法》所確立的中華人民共和國根本制度或推翻中華人民共和國中央政權機關或者特區政權機關等，涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》第二十二條『顛覆國家政權罪』，警方遂依法向法院申請拘捕令，並通緝有關人士。任何倡議某些人或組織不應就其違法行為，包括勾結外國或境外勢力的違法行為，受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，這完全違反法治精神。」

「《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》下的罪行訂有適當的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區一致。香港警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛藏境外的潛逃者被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，肆意勾結外部勢力包庇其惡行。警方採取一切合法措施，強烈打擊有關潛逃行為，做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。」

「我們必須強調，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威等自由。然而，和世界其他地方一樣，很多權利和自由並非絕對，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》也清楚訂明，在有必要保障國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，可以依法限制部分權利和自由，包括言論自由。針對極少部分危害國家安全的組織和個人，特區政府對其犯罪行為絕不姑息，一定追究到底，並採取一切可行方法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全的人士。」

發言人強調：「潛逃者不要妄想潛逃離港就可以逃避刑責。他們最終都需要為其危害國家安全的嚴重犯罪行為負上責任，受到法律制裁。任何國家或組織亦不應包庇犯罪分子，或以不同藉口嘗試為這些人開脫。」

發言人重申：「特區政府會一如既往堅定不移、全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府強烈要求歐盟立即停止不符合國際法和國際關係基本準則的行為，立即停止干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」"

文化體育及旅遊局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-08-01 13:33,2025-08-01 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100408.htm,"​以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（八月一日）出席「CHIIKAWA DAYS」大型特展開幕典禮後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：想問局長，昨晚阿仙奴對熱刺的球賽氣氛如何？另外，有關啟德體育園的草地狀況，現在有沒有解決方法？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：昨晚（球賽）的氣氛真的很興奮，現在仍未興奮完。我昨晚看到的不論是阿仙奴——紅色的球迷，還是熱刺——白色的球迷，都盡力為自己的球隊打氣。他們亦各出奇謀，又有旗、打氣棒及牌，最主要是我看到兩隊的球員均十分欣賞場館，又不知道是否因為有冷氣，比賽都特別落力，所以我相信大家都盡興而歸。及至晚上，我跟我的團隊在球賽完結後到九龍城宵夜，雖然是一個星期四夜晚，翌日早上要上班，但亦看見了很多朋友。我還遇見有一枱來自四川的遊客，有大人有小朋友，他們就很興奮，更說已來（香港）超過十次，並會繼續來港，覺得香港很好玩。不用我們去說，而是真實的，不論是我們本地或是外地的球迷，參與了我們的盛事，或者像今天我們這個盛事（「CHIIKAWA DAYS」大型特展），大家現在看到人們都在排隊入場中，氣氛都是好的。我們這個夏天會繼續有更多盛事，亦會持續這個熱鬧的氣氛。

在草地方面，昨日談了很多。其實主要是因為我們過去兩星期的天氣的確不穩定，我們有十號風球、黑雨。我們在晚上留意到情況，已關上了天幕，處理了水的控制。但大家可能都留意到我曾在社交媒體發文，我們亦用了紫外光燈照草地，希望（草地）生長得更好、更茂密、更綠，但始終天氣的狀況不似預期；加上利物浦那場球賽，之後就是昨晚的球賽，還有數場練習，草地使用頻密。昨晚我除了特別在賽前跟黃威和張炎有去視察草地外，亦於賽事完結後在頒獎時，特別注意草地，看看有否泥頭凸起，會否有很多洞。我自己目測所見，到中圈都沒有這些情況，龍門口可能會有較多泥沙，但這是正常。我們會請啟德（體育園）方面努力檢視，在香港的氣候，以及在香港啟德體育園主場館除了進行球賽、亦會舉行大型音樂會的情況下，我們如何將草地保養得更好。

記者：財政司司長發布的營商環境報告（《香港營商環境報告：一國兩制 獨特優勢》），局長之前回應過旅遊方面，在文化體育方面是否也有信心香港發揮到獨特營商優勢？具體會如何發揮？剛剛提到鼓勵業界使用IP（知識產權）拓展商機，具體有何計劃幫助業界？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：IP方面，文創處（文創產業發展處）一直有不同資助，也有很多不同計劃，主要在培養人才方面，也提供足夠的支援，就如今日的活動，我們也是支持贊助機構。另外在產業方面，也帶動了旅遊很多，今年上半年旅客人數非常多，已經超過2 400萬人次，是（百分比）雙位數字的增長。除此之外，大家問及文化體育，文體旅是深度融合的，所以體育方面，正如昨晚大家所見，香港足球盛會2025兩場大型比賽帶動了我們整個經濟，除了買票入場外，周邊產業，如大家所見，買球衣、買文創產品，以及旁邊的餐飲、零售、交通等都帶到了很多商機。

文化方面亦一樣，我們現正進行中的有中華文化節，我們每年會有香港藝術節，接下來亦會有「亞藝無疆」藝術節，以及很多博物館（活動），成為吸引旅客很大的一個賣點。這些都會令更多旅客對香港有興趣，接着他們會來香港，甚至多留一下。這除了靠政府用好中央的惠港政策之餘，亦要靠本地商家，如何動腦筋，多走一步。例如最近幾個晚上，有盛事活動時，商戶都會較夜才關門。他們跟我說，情況十分理想，生意做多了，我想這些都是推動香港經濟和營商環境進一步發展，多謝大家。"

我先分享幾句，我覺得這個致辭也太嚴肅吧。很多謝SK （AllRightsReserved（ARR）創辦人及創意總監林樹鑫）、Celia （宏利香港及澳門首席市場總監林沛）、Jeny（香港鐵路有限公司常務總監楊美珍）、Peter（香港旅遊發展局主席林建岳博士）、Randi（香港麥當勞行政總裁黎韋詩），還有很多贊助（活動）的朋友、嘉賓，還有很多傳媒朋友，大家都好像我一樣興奮，可能因為昨晚觀看完阿仙奴對熱刺，今早一早便要出動，都是值得，看Chiikawa是很開心的。所以，今日大家都很高興來到由AllRightsReserved舉辦的「CHIIKAWA DAYS」大型特展開幕典禮。

其實近年來，很多文化、IP（文化知識產權）在全球各地，當然包括香港，掀起一股熱潮，（成為）炙手可熱的話題。這些IP與香港旅遊業息息相關。除了政府積極推動文創產業發展外，我們為業界提供支援和培養創意人才，亦鼓勵業界善用香港的IP資源去拓展商機，產業化非常重要。因為這些相關IP入面包含的產品活動能夠吸引來自世界各地的旅客，為他們帶來豐富嶄新的旅遊體驗，其中一個例子，我想在座朋友都去過，就是剛結束的動漫電玩展，看見（市民）在黑雨都風雨不改，排隊入場搶購心頭好，亦吸引了本地和海外無數的忠粉撐場。

今日活動的主辦單位——剛才大家都見過SK——ARR多年來在香港推出不少IP活動，我記得自己在這幾年，過去一年先後前往「100%多啦A夢&FRIENDS」巡迴展覽，亦是在這個場地，今年展覽由上層搬到地下，（地方）更大更好。另外，「PANDA GO！香港遊」亦是大家很歡迎的一個項目，吸引大家瘋狂前來打卡、參觀。除了感到很開心外，也會好像我那樣，重拾多年童真和一些童年記憶等，亦為香港的藝術文化增添新的大都會色彩。

今次特展是今年夏天最令人期待的IP主題盛事之一。展覽有創新元素，亦有本地特色，我想大家在網上已經開始看如何搶購以點心呈現出來的不同Chiikawa人物。我自己最喜歡的就是「鮮蝦腸粉」和「臘腸卷」，因為我喜歡「小八」，所以我覺得「鮮蝦腸粉」和「臘腸卷」最有趣，但其他如「糯米雞」、「蝦餃」、「燒賣」，其實都很可愛。我剛剛在展覽走了一圈，大家有機會可以看看裏面有不同的場景讓市民「打卡」。我剛才說的「蝦餃」、「燒賣」亦在裏面「食」的場景可以看到。另外，還有「衣」、「住」、「返工」，大家都知道Chiikawa可能是說一些上班的comment（留言），說進大家的心坎裏，稍後大家都可以透過這一枝「棒」獲得驚喜。所以，我希望今次這場展覽吸引世界各地的粉絲和旅客來港朝聖，我知道今日前來的傳媒朋友當中，有一些也是來自香港以外，歡迎你們。希望你們可以親身感受Chiikawa和香港豐富多元、中西薈萃的美食文化。

展望將來，我希望社會各界及一眾優秀的藝術家繼續攜手合作，讓更多具獨特IP元素的創意產業可以落戶香港，進一步鞏固我們作為國際文化大都會及國際旅遊樞紐的地位，政府亦會大力支持。

我衷心祝願「CHIIKAWA DAYS」大型特展圓滿成功。多謝大家。"

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。今天，我非常榮幸受邀參加第十屆黃金時代展覽暨高峰會，並為大會致開幕辭。我感謝黃金時代基金會舉辦是次活動，亦向各位嘉賓的蒞臨表示熱烈的歡迎和衷心的感謝！

本次高峰會的主題聚焦於發掘銀髮經濟的潛力，探討財務規劃、強積金（強制性公積金）與投資策略的最新進展與政策方向。這不僅是一個交流的平台，更是一次我們共同探索如何釋放銀髮經濟潛力的機會，為香港長者構築更穩健的未來。

積極應對高齡化挑戰，推動銀色財務保障

全球人口高齡化是一個不可逆轉的趨勢，香港亦面對同樣情況。根據政府統計處的數據，65歲及以上長者人口比例預計將從二○二一年的百分之二十點五上升至二○四六年的百分之三十六。換言之，到二○四六年，大約每三位香港人中就有一位是長者。面對人口結構的轉變，香港政府致力於推廣銀色財務及保障措施，協助長者善用財富與理財工具，提升退休生活後的財務保障。

不少香港長者擁有一定的財富積累，為銀髮經濟的發展奠定了堅實基礎。政府的目標是通過全面的政策和措施，幫助長者有效管理財務資源，確保他們在退休後能夠享有穩定的生活及充足的經濟保障。

強積金制度：為退休儲蓄提供堅實後盾

今日我看到很多金融界別的機構在場，包括銀行、保險公司。我相信部分是要來賣廣告的，我們政府也要賣廣告。

我第一個要賣廣告的是強積金制度。香港退休保障的核心支柱是離不開強積金的。截至去年年底，全港由60歲及以上人士持有的強積金帳戶約有150萬個，總資產達1,800億港元，佔強積金總資產的百分之十四。為提升強積金的投資效益與靈活性，政府與強制性公積金計劃管理局（積金局）持續擴闊投資選擇並優化回報。針對市民對收費及投資選擇的關注，各強積金計劃現已引入預設投資策略，實現環球分散投資、自動調整風險水平，並設收費上限，為市民提供更便捷及易於採用的長期退休儲蓄方案。

積金易平台：一站管理、惠及銀髮

另一個在強積金制度下比較大的進展是積金易平台。去年六月推出的積金易是強積金制度自二○○○年成立以來最具里程碑意義的改革之一。積金易通過標準化、精簡化和自動化行政流程，大幅提升強積金制度的運作效率，降低行政成本，讓市民可一站式管理強積金帳戶，更為便利。這不僅為退休儲蓄帶來即時且實質的益處，還降低了服務提供者的入行門檻，可吸引更多企業參與，促進市場競爭與行業發展。

積金易善用金融科技，解決強積金制度的長期痛點，進一步鞏固其作為市民退休保障支柱的角色，對銀髮一族而言，無疑是更安心的保障。積金易更有助優化養老金融產業鏈，為銀髮經濟注入新動能，創造更多商機，推動香港成為養老金融的區域領先者。大家如果還未下載積金易流動應用程式，我呼籲各位盡快下載。

HKMC退休3寶：把「磚頭、保單、存款」變「長糧」

第二個我想為其賣廣告的是「HKMC退休3寶」。香港按揭證券有限公司自二○二一年中推出「HKMC退休3寶」，包括安老按揭計劃、保單逆按計劃及香港年金計劃，協助巿民將多年努力工作而儲下的「磚頭、保單、存款」變為「長糧」，讓大家能用好其「退休3寶」，為退休生活提供靈活且穩定的收入來源，填補市場缺口。這三項產品均以提供即時、穩定及終身收入為目標，協助長者管理退休後的財務風險。

安老按揭計劃

其中，安老按揭計劃讓物業業主釋放住宅價值，讓他們既可獲得每月固定收入，也可繼續居住在原有居所直至終老，無需還款。截至今年六月，該計劃累計批出逾8 400宗申請，每宗平均每月年金約16,200港元，借款人平均年齡68歲，超過一半申請者選擇終身收取年金。

保單逆按計劃

而保單逆按計劃則允許借款人以壽險保單作為抵押，轉化身故賠償價值為即時現金流。每月年金金額固定，協助退休人士靈活運用財富。當借款人百年歸老後，貸款機構會以壽險保單的身故賠償金額清還貸款，如身故賠償金額超過貸款總結欠，貸款機構會把多出的餘額退還給其後人。如有不足，將由按證保險公司承擔。

香港年金計劃

香港年金計劃則為退休人士提供終身年金，市場反應熱烈。自香港年金公司成立至今年六月，保費申請總額達239億港元。今年首六個月，保單數量約11 500張，保費總額約54億港元，較去年同期增長四倍，反映市場對年金產品的強勁需求。

結語

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，銀髮一族為香港的繁榮發展貢獻了畢生心血，而銀髮經濟則為他們的退休生活提供了堅實保障。政府與業界將繼續攜手，通過優化銀色財務與保障措施，推動銀髮經濟的蓬勃發展，為長者創造更優質的退休生活。讓我們共同努力，打造一個更具活力與包容性的銀髮未來！謝謝大家。"

盧會長（香港中華廠商聯合會（廠商會）會長盧金榮博士）、施主席（廠商會副會長兼廠商會展覽服務有限公司主席施榮恆）、各位嘉賓：

大家好。很高興出席今年的「工展會購物節」開幕禮。

要做好零售，離不開三大要素：有人、有場、有貨。談到人流，除了本地消費者，旅客亦是重要人流來源，令人鼓舞的是香港旅客數字有顯著上升，去年全年訪港旅客量按年上升三成至近4 500萬人次，而今年上半年訪港旅客約2 400萬人次，按年再增加12%，反映香港旅遊業復蘇勢頭良好，為零售消費市場帶來更多商機。政府會繼續發揮香港國際旅遊樞紐角色，吸引更多旅客來港，進一步提振零售業。

另外，銷售平台亦相當重要。「工展會購物節」是一個結合食、買、玩的盛事，自二○二一年首度登場以來深受市民和遊客好評，不僅讓普羅大眾盡情享受購物樂趣，更為港商提供推廣和銷售產品的平台，讓企業有更多機會接觸消費者、提升品牌影響力。

同時，政府在過去兩年積極鼓勵企業發展電子商貿（電商）業務以拓展更多銷售渠道。當中我們透過香港貿易發展局舉行的第二屆「香港好物節」，同樣於今日登場，協助港商把握內地電商平台的豐富客源和流量，提升品牌及產品在內地的知名度。今年，我們有近260個品牌參與，以優惠折扣、直播帶貨和線上線下不同渠道進行推廣，若內地的朋友在實體「工展會購物節」「掃貨」後仍意猶未盡，可以繼續在「香港好物節」平台上選購香港優質產品。

要吸引及留住消費者的最終都是產品本身，「工展會購物節」匯聚琳琅滿目的產品，能為消費者帶來豐富的購物體驗，尤其香港品牌一直深受消費者信賴和喜愛。我亦藉此機會感謝廠商會及香港品牌發展局一直不遺餘力推廣香港品牌發展，鼓勵企業透過建立自家品牌增加競爭力，以在充滿挑戰的市場環境中突顯優勢，並為香港經濟注入新動能。

最後，我預祝廠商會今屆「工展會購物節」丁財兩旺，各位開心購物、活動圓滿成功。多謝。"
天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-08-01 11:33,2025-08-01 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100320.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月一日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-01 11:33,2025-08-01 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025080100323.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 1) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

The new limit will take effect on January 1, 2026.

  The Legislative Council approved on July 30 the Amendment Regulation made by the RBHK in accordance with the Radiation Ordinance (Cap. 303) upon stakeholder consultation, which lowers the occupational eye lens dose limit specified in the Radiation (Control of Irradiating Apparatus) Regulations (Cap. 303B) from 150 millisieverts in a year to 20 millisieverts in a year, averaged over defined periods of five years, with no single year exceeding 50 millisieverts.

  The technical amendment aims to align with the latest international standard recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, with a view to better protecting practitioners from developing radiation-induced cataracts. The Radiation Health Division of the Department of Health has earlier introduced a monitoring service on occupational eye lens radiation doses for local practitioners to assist the industry in complying with the new limit.

  The RBHK is established under section 3 of the Radiation Ordinance to carry out functions in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance and its subsidiary legislations, including the adoption of statutory dose limits for persons employed in radiation work."

  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

Government expands drug list of Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme,2025-08-01 10:00,2025-08-01 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/01/P2025073100584.htm,"  The Health Bureau announced today (August 1) that the Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme) has expanded the coverage of its basic-tier drug list from 59 items to 114 items starting from today. The expansion provides participating family doctors with more drug choices to cater for the different clinical prescription needs of participants in the Scheme.

  The basic-tier drug list of the CDCC Pilot Scheme covers commonly used drugs for treating chronic diseases (such as anti-hypertensive drugs, lipid-regulating and anti-diabetic drugs) and episodic illnesses. Under government subsidy, participants prescribed with drugs on the list will not be required to pay for such medication. The drugs on the list form the foundation of the community drug formulary to be launched in the future. The Government reviews the basic-tier drug list from time to time to better meet the clinical needs of participants. Having reviewed the actual needs of participants, the Government included 55 additional drug items in the basic-tier drug list starting from August 1, covering antidepressants and drugs for the management of chronic hepatitis B, osteoporosis and thyroid disorder. Additionally, more drugs were added to address health problems associated with episodic illnesses, such as drugs for relieving asthma exacerbation, gout, nausea and vertigo. The expanded drug list now covers 114 basic-tier drug items, up from 59 items previously, providing family doctors with greater flexibility to cater for the clinical needs of participants. The latest basic-tier drug list is set out in the Annex.

  The Government launched the CDCC Pilot Scheme in November 2023, providing subsidised diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT) screening services in the private healthcare sector to Hong Kong residents aged 45 or above with no known medical history of DM or HT, with a view to achieving ""early prevention, early identification and early treatment"". On March 28 this year, the scope of screening under the Scheme was expanded to include blood lipid testing to achieve full coverage of the ""three highs"". Participants diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT or hyperlipidaemia after screenings can proceed to the treatment phase and will be subsidised by the Government to continue their treatment with self-selected family doctors, and subject to their health conditions, be offered prescribed medication and follow-up care at dedicated nurse clinics and allied health services.

  The CDCC Pilot Scheme has been well received since its launch, with over 140 000 participants enrolled in the Scheme to date. As of July 23 (provisional figures), about 85 000 participants have completed the screenings, of which around 34 000 (i.e. about 40 per cent) have been diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT or hyperlipidaemia and have proceeded to the treatment phase. The Government will continue to promote the CDCC Pilot Scheme to encourage citizens to prevent and manage chronic diseases proactively, thereby enhancing the overall health of the general public.

  For more details of the CDCC Pilot Scheme, members of the public may visit its dedicated website (www.primaryhealthcare.gov.hk/cdcc/en/) or call the hotline at 2157 0500. Dedicated staff of the hotline will answer calls from 9am to 9pm from Mondays to Saturdays."

「慢病共治計劃」設有基本藥物名單，涵蓋治療慢性疾病的常用藥物（如抗高血壓、調節血脂和降血糖的藥物），以及治療偶發性疾病的常用藥物。在政府資助下，獲處方名單所列藥物的參加者無須支付任何藥費。名單所列藥物將會是未來推出的社區藥物名冊的基礎部分。為更切合參加者的臨床需要，政府不時審視該基本藥物名單。經檢視參加者的實際需求後，政府由八月一日起在基本藥物名單增添55項藥物，包括抗抑鬱藥、用於治療慢性乙型肝炎、骨質疏鬆症及甲狀腺疾病藥物。此外，名單亦增加更多針對與偶發性疾病相關健康問題的藥物，如紓緩哮喘和痛風、緩解噁心和眩暈的藥物。擴大後的名單所涵蓋的基本藥物總數會由原來的59項增加至114項，為家庭醫生提供更大彈性，以照顧參加者的臨床需求。最新的基本藥物名單詳見附件。

政府於二○二三年十一月推出「慢病共治計劃」，資助45歲或以上未曾確診患有糖尿病或高血壓的香港居民，在私營醫療市場接受糖尿病及高血壓篩查服務，以達致「早預防、早發現、早治療」。計劃於今年三月二十八日擴展至包含血脂檢查，實現「三高全覆蓋」。經篩查後被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的參加者可進入治療階段，並在政府資助下由自行選擇的家庭醫生繼續為其診治，以及按個人健康狀況獲處方藥物，接受專屬護士診所和專職醫療服務跟進。

「慢病共治計劃」自推出以來反應良好，至今已有超過14萬名市民參加計劃。截至七月二十三日（臨時數字），約85 000人已完成篩查，其中約34 000人（即約四成）被診斷為血糖偏高、患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂，並已進入治療階段。政府會繼續推廣「慢病共治計劃」，鼓勵市民積極預防及管理慢性疾病，從而提升全民健康。

Those who have provided mobile phone numbers or email addresses would have received related messages. All SMS messages issued by the REO will start with the prefix '#REO' in the sender ID for identification,"" a spokesman for the REO said.

Prompt reply to reminding letters if requested

 Electors who have been included in the omissions lists will receive reminding letters from the REO to confirm their eligibility.

For any enquiries, members of the public may call the REO's hotline (2891 1001) during office hours by August 25.
