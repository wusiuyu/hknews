文化體育及旅遊局局長出席「第十五屆全國運動會香港賽區義工計劃」誓師典禮致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-09-14 19:36,2025-09-14 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400574.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（九月十四日）出席「第十五屆全國運動會香港賽區義工計劃」誓師典禮的致辭全文：

Raymond（香港賽馬會公司事務執行總監譚志源）、黃江天先生（義務工作發展局副主席）、郭永亮先生（香港志願者協會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位義工朋友：

大家下午好。今日很開心，其實這個已是我今日出席的第三個與體育有關的活動，但來到這裏仍然非常興奮，因為見到大家。今日是第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會和第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）香港賽區義工誓師典禮。今日的典禮標誌着超過16 000位義工正式獲得委任，組成一支香港歷來最大的義工團隊，為即將到來的全運會服務。

十五運會和殘特奧會，大家都知道是首次由粵港澳三地共同承辦。而香港特區能夠承辦，既是國家對我們的信任與認可，也體現香港積極融入國家發展大局。

剛才播放的短片，大家可能找到自己出現在片段，但將來你們會在更多影片、更多場合出現。剛才回顧了我們自去年七月開始，招募、遴選和培訓義工的過程。我們現在組成這支龐大的義工團隊，有超過1 000位是15至17歲的青少年朋友，這裏有沒有15至17歲的義工？還是今日大人多些？拍手的我也視你為15至17歲，心態年輕便行了，對吧？另外，在15 000位成人義工當中，有學生、在職朋友、家庭主婦、銀髮一族及已退休的朋友，其中最年長的一位已年過80歲。這一方面體現了香港的確是個很長壽的城市，80歲也做全運會義工；第二方面體現了無論是甚麼年齡和背景，只要大家都抱持相同理念和熱誠去服務，都可以用實際行動支持十五運會和殘特奧會這兩項國家體育盛事。

隨着義工朋友正式獲得委任，我希望大家以最真誠態度參與義工服務，尊重及遵守義工守則，全力支持十五運會和殘特奧會。正如今屆志願服務口號「為你，更精彩」所傳遞的信息一樣，透過你們每一位的參與，將令十五運會和殘特奧會更加精彩。你們的使命不僅在於為賽事提供支持，更重要在於用你們的笑容、細心與專業展示香港最美好的一面，讓從全國各地來到參賽的運動員和觀賽的觀眾感受到香港的好客之道。我曾說過，希望香港人人都是旅遊大使，16 000位義工就是香港「排頭兵」的旅遊大使，我們的希望就在大家身上。我也希望透過今次的好客之道，將香港更進一步融入大灣區，作出更大貢獻。

在此，我要特別感謝香港賽馬會。香港賽馬會是香港賽區的唯一合作夥伴，提供4億5 000萬元贊助以支持賽事的籌辦，而其中約1億2 100萬元將用於義工計劃，包括義工培訓、開發信息管理系統、津貼、膳食，以及大家今日所穿、很漂亮的制服等。除提供資助外，大家今日都見到馬會的朋友，包括譚（志源）總監，都穿了一件很醒目的紅色衣服，這件紅色衣服是馬會義工隊的制服。馬會義工隊亦參與我們的義工團隊，在不同崗位為十五運會和殘特奧會提供服務，我們衷心感謝馬會的鼎力支持。

同時，我也要感謝義務工作發展局和香港志願者協會兩間協作機構。他們在過去一年多以來，策劃和推展整個義工計劃，勞苦功高。大家剛才所見的義工招募、培訓，以及義工的調配和管理，為我們整個義工團隊提供堅實的支援，確保每位義工朋友都能發揮最大潛力。

最後，大家剛才都看到，評審其實是一項很艱辛的工作，有時可能悶悶的，也肯定需要很多精神。我要衷心感謝近200位義務評審以及所有參與義工計劃的團體，他們在很短的時間內，會見三萬多名個人及團體義工申請人，從中選出最合適的這16 000位義工，協助組成我們這支充滿幹勁和熱誠的義工團隊。

各位義工朋友，包括今日在座的，以及未必在我們當中但一定會看到這個典禮的，或稍後會聽到這個信息的各位義工朋友，今日的授旗與宣誓不僅僅是一個儀式，更是一份承諾、一份榮譽。外面的裝置其實有你們的名字，每一位朋友的名字都印了出來，名字在上面，是一份你們應該得到的榮耀。成功舉辦大型盛事，絕對有賴你們的參與和付出，希望我們攜手努力，將這場屬於國家、屬於香港，也屬於每一位市民的體育盛事辦得更加精彩！多謝大家。"
"Over 16 000 volunteers officially appointed for 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG (with photos) ",2025-09-14 19:01,2025-09-14 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400620.htm,"âThe National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) (NGCO) today (September 14) held a pledging ceremony for the volunteers of the 15th National Games (NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG) in Hong Kong, with over 16 000 volunteers officially appointed to serve for the Hong Kong competition region at the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG. They will form the largest-ever volunteer team in Hong Kong, providing services across various roles for the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG. These roles cover services for arrival, departure and hotel reception, spectator services, guest reception, anti-doping support and presentation ceremony support etc.

The ceremony was held at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium. The officiating guests included the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law; the Permanent Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Ms Vivian Sum; the Head of the NGCO, Mr Yeung Tak-keung; the Executive Director, Corporate Affairs, the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Raymond Tam; Vice-Chairman of the Agency for Volunteer Service Dr James Wong, and the Chairman of the Hong Kong Volunteers Association, Mr Andy Kwok. At the ceremony, nearly 1 800 volunteer representatives took an oath under the witness of officiating guests, committing to upholding their services at the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG with dedication. They were presented with flags. The gold medallist in the Women's Individual Épée event at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games and a member of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Volunteer Team, Vivian Kong, and former Hong Kong athlete, Leung Kwok-shing, were appointed as the Volunteer Ambassadors at the ceremony.

Speaking at the ceremony, Miss Law said that the volunteer team comprises more than 1 000 youths aged 15 to 17, together with over 15 000 adult volunteers from diverse age groups and backgrounds, the eldest being over 80 years old. They share the same philosophy and passion for services to support the two national mega sports events with devoted actions. She also expressed gratitude to the Hong Kong Jockey Club for its sponsorship in supporting the organisation of the competition events, including volunteer training, development of the information management system, allowances, catering, and uniforms. She also thanked the Agency for Volunteer Service and the Hong Kong Volunteers Association for planning and implementing the entire volunteer programme, including recruitment and training, thereby providing solid support to the entire volunteer work.

The first performance at the event was a Combi Latin Dance 3-Dance by Hong Kong wheelchair dancers Matthew Yu and Pandora Choi, who had just won gold medals in the Combi Latin Dance 3-Dance and 5-Dance competitions at the mass participation para dance sport competition of the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG. The Hong Kong Dance Company performed ""Fencing"", a dance inspired by the elite sport of fencing. Fencer Ryan Choi and table tennis athlete Doo Hoi-kam shared how volunteers assisted athletes during international competitions, enabling them to focus on their performance. Ryan Choi also sang live to encourage the volunteers who will be serving at the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG.

The volunteer nickname of the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG is Little Dolphin, signifying that volunteers from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao are friendly, lovely, motivated, intelligent and united like dolphins. The volunteer service slogan is ""Be more wonderful for you"". While ""you"" represents the events of the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG, as well as everyone who witnesses, participates in and supports the Games, ""wonderful"" is one of the requirements for hosting the Games. It also embodies athletes' excellent performances and volunteers' contributions to the Games.

The first batch of tickets for the Hong Kong competition region of the 15th NG, covering four competition events, namely beach volleyball, handball (men), basketball (men's U22) and rugby sevens, went on sale late last month. The second batch of tickets, covering the remaining four competition events, namely track cycling, golf, triathlon and fencing, will be available for sale in late September.

The Commissioner of Correctional Services, Mr Wong Kwok-hing, officiated at the ceremony. Other guests included members of the CSPL Honorary Advisory Committee and representatives from schools participating in the school-based CSPL programme. More than 100 trainees and their family members attended.

Addressing the ceremony, Mr Wong said that since the launch of the Rehabilitation Pioneer Project (RPP) in 2008, the CSD has been dedicated to promoting community education. In 2018, the youth uniformed group Rehabilitation Pioneer Leaders (RPL) was established, for which diverse community education activities and trainings were organised. To emphasise their relationship with the CSD and highlight their unique professional characteristics, the RPP and RPL were renamed as the Correctional Services Pioneer Project (CSPP) and CSPL respectively, representing a new chapter in the Department's community education initiatives.

Moreover, the Department also hosted a promotion ceremony for CSPL trainees today. With their outstanding performances over the years, 64 trainees were promoted this year following the completion of stringent assessments. Among them, three trainees were promoted to Senior Leaders, eight were promoted to Intermediate Leaders, and 53 were promoted to Advanced Leaders. Mr Wong extended his congratulations to the promoted trainees and encouraged them to pass on their knowledge and experiences to new members, guiding new recruits in their collective development, fostering team spirit, and contributing to society.

At the ceremony, CSPL trainees shared their experiences from participating in the programme. They mentioned that the training broadened their horizons and helped them discover their potential. They aspired to actively give back to society, promote the values of inclusiveness and being law-abiding, and work together to build a better Hong Kong.

To support the long-term development of the CSPL, the CSD appointed 15 correctional officers from various sections of the Department with specialised skills or experiences in youth work this year to serve as volunteer mentors. This initiative aims to inject new momentum into the programme, driving the programme toward professional and systematic development.

With the official launch of the CSPP and CSPL, the CSD will continue to, through organising diverse activities, disseminate to young people the messages of safeguarding the country and home, leading a law-abiding and drug-free life as well as supporting offender rehabilitation."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-14 18:06,2025-09-14 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400573.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 14), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

The case involves a 46-year-old female living in Tung Chung. Preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Jiangmen in Guangdong on September 6, during which she was bitten by mosquitoes. She returned to Hong Kong on the same day. She developed a fever, joint pain and a rash from September 11. She went to Jiangmen on the same day and attended a local hospital there before returning to Hong Kong on September 12. She attended Queen Elizabeth Hospital on September 13 and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing by the Hospital Authority.

  Four people who accompanied the patient to Jiangmen on September 6 and another household contact of her (who did not travel to Jiangmen with her) are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

  Since the patient stayed in Jiangmen during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 17 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 201 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (September 7 to 13), similar to the previous two weeks, which reported 178 cases (August 31 to September 6) and 225 cases (August 24 to 30) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other regions that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, etc. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also the Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-14 17:29,2025-09-14 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400559.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月十四日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。

最新個案資料

病人為46歲女子，住所位於東涌。初步調查顯示，她於九月六日到訪廣東省江門市，期間曾被蚊叮咬，同日回港。她由九月十一日開始出現發燒、關節痛和皮疹，同日前往江門當地的醫院求醫，翌日（九月十二日）回港，於九月十三日到伊利沙伯醫院求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。醫院管理局的化驗結果顯示她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

與病人於九月六日同行到江門的四名人士，及病人的另一名家居接觸者（沒有同行到江門市），現時都沒有出現病徵，全部正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期曾身處江門市，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，均屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得17宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（九月七日至十三日）廣東省新增201宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別178宗（八月三十一日至九月六日）及225宗（八月二十四日至三十日）相若。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。雖然廣東省基孔肯雅熱的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

在首宗案件中，一名七十五歲男旅客九月十二日從墨西哥墨西哥城經日本東京飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在其寄艙行李箱的咖啡豆包裝內發現該批懷疑冰毒，重約三公斤，估計市值約一百萬元，遂把他拘捕。

在第二宗案件中，一名二十五歲男旅客和一名二十五歲的女旅客昨日從泰國曼谷經上海飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在男旅客的其中一個寄艙行李箱內發現該批收藏於真空包裝袋的懷疑大麻花，重約十公斤，估計市值約二百一十萬元，兩人隨即被捕。

首宗案件的被捕人士已被控以一項販運危險藥物罪，而第二宗案件的兩名被捕人士則共同被控以一項販運危險藥物罪，以上三名被捕人士將於明日（九月十五日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

Hong Kong Customs detects two drug trafficking cases involving passengers at airport (with photos),2025-09-14 15:47,2025-09-14 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400436.htm,"âHong Kong Customs on September 12 and yesterday (September 13) detected two drug trafficking casesinvolving air passengers at Hong Kong International Airport and seized a total of about 3 kilograms of suspected methamphetamine and about 10 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with a total estimated market value of about $3.1 million. Two males and one female were arrested.

In the first case, a 75-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Mexico City, Mexico via Tokyo, Japan, on September 12. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected methamphetamine, weighing about 3 kilograms with an estimated market value of about 1 million concealed in the coffee beans packages in his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

In the second case, a male passenger and a female passenger, both aged 25 arriving in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand via Shanghai yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found a batch of suspected cannabis buds, weighing about 10 kilograms with an estimated market value of about $2.1 million, concealed in vacuum-sealed bags inside one of the check-in suitcases of the male passenger. The two persons were subsequently arrested.

The arrested person in the first case has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. Two arrested persons in the second case have been jointly charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. Two cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (September 15).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.
