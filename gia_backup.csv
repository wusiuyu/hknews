Hospital Authority's statement regarding calibration certificate for vibration sensor used in hospital redevelopment and expansion projects,2025-12-10 23:26,2025-12-10 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000866.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) issued the following statement today (December 10) regarding the calibration certificate for vibration sensor used in hospital redevelopment and expansion projects:

The HA yesterday (December 9) reported to the police a suspected case of forged calibration certificate for vibration sensor for further investigation. A subcontractor named Novox Limited (Novox) submitted the calibration certificate to the main contractor, China Railway Construction Group Co.,Ltd (CRCC), for the expansion project of the Lai King Building in Princess Margaret Hospital (LKB). And the certificate was submitted to HA through the main contractor. Subsequent verification by the HA confirmed that the calibration certificate was not issued by the Guangdong Zhongzhenghang Metrology Testing Co., Ltd as listed on the certificate.

The HA takes this matter very seriously thus actively reporting to the Police. The HA has also instructed the main contractor to rigorously follow up and thoroughly investigate the incident. The HA has also requested the main contractor to suspend the work of the subcontractor, Novox Limited (Novox) and the HA reserves all rights to pursue legal action against any breach of hospital construction contract.

Vibration sensors are installed at hospital redevelopment and expansion sites to ensure that vibrations generated by construction works do not affect hospital operations and medical services. Apart from installing vibration sensors at hospital construction sites, the project team will also deploy portable instruments for manual monitoring where necessary. The vibration sensors are generally calibrated annually by the contractor to ensure the accuracy of the monitoring data. The contractor is also required to provide a certificate after the calibration.

The spokesperson for the HA emphasized, ""These monitoring instruments serve a precautionary purpose. In parallel, the main contractor also use portable instruments for manual monitoring. We are also closely monitoring the feedbacks by our stakeholders. Should any healthcare staff report any service disturbance from the construction work, regardless of whether the vibration levels exceed specified limits, the hospital will prioritize patient safety and medical services by immediately suspending the relevant construction work. Over the past six months, the HA has not received any reports of medical services being suspended due to vibrations caused by hospital construction.""

The spokesperson added that the HA has conducted a preliminary assessment of the incident that there was no impact on medical services nor patient safety.

The HA is highly committed to ensuring the safety and management of hospital construction projects. All hospital construction contracts specify reference levels for acceptable vibration levels to ensure the impact of construction on hospital operations and medical services is minimized. The HA will investigate the relevant projects comprehensively, to verify all surveillance data and the process of data upload. The HA also strictly requires contractors to implement measures ensuring all works comply with relevant regulations. Regular inspections by the construction consultants are conducted to monitor contractors' adherence to the requirements and verify compliance standards.

Novox was a subcontractor of vibration monitoring hired by the main contractors in various hospital redevelopment and expansion projects (including the LKB expansion project), whereas BEWIS Sensing Technology LLC (BEWIS) was the subcontractor of Novox in vibration sensor supply and equipment calibration.

On October 27, HA received notification from BEWIS stating that the contractual relationship with Novox has already been terminated. After redeiving such information, the HA immediately inquired the main contractors of all relevant hospital construction projects, requiring them to ensure that all projects remain unaffected. The HA also instructed the construction consultants and main contractors to reassess the performance of projects undertaken by Novox. Main contractors were reminded to strengthen supervision to ensure project quality meets standards and contractual requirements. The HA has also required all main contractors to commission accredited testing centers to recalibrate vibration sensors and submit certificates.

OnNovember 15, the HA subsequently received five calibration certificates by Novox from the main contractor of LKB. Among all, four of the calibration were conducted on October 28, 2025, while the remaing one was conducted on November25, 2024. Meanwhile, the HA received a relevant enquiry from HK01 on November 18. For the sake of prudency, the HA particularly tried to verify the authenticity of the certificate with the accredited testing centers. On December 8, the HA received notification through CRCC that the relevant authority had not issued such calibration certificate and suspected that the document was forged.

Currently, apart from the LKB, Novox has also undertaken vibration monitoring projects for other hospitals, including Kwong Wah Hospital, Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital, Grantham Hospital, and North District Hospital. Novox has also been appointed by various main contractors on real time noise and vibration monitoring system and the online monitoring platform, as well as noise and dust meters. In view of the abovementioned incidents, the HA will comprehensively review and trace all hospital construction projects and services commissioned by Novox, and the certificates submitted by Novox. The HA has zero tolerance on fraudulence. If any fraudulent activity is discovered, the matter will definitely be referred to the police for further investigation and damages will be claimed."

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-10 22:20,2025-12-10 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000839.htm,"The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.1 billion as of noon today (December 10). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.4 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

The Government earlier announced that a living allowance from the Support Fund will be provided to each affected household and the amount has been increased from $50,000 to $100,000. As of today, 1 717 cases have been processed. In addition, the Government will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 109 cases have been processed. The allowance will be disbursed in phases.

Moreover, the Government announced today that a new special one-off grant of $100,000 under the fund will be provided to flat owners of all the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court.

Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Accommodation support

Another 2 677 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Separately, the temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre has ceased operation as users in the shelter have all relocated to the emergency accommodations arranged by the Government for affected residents. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall remains in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 700 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 16 300 pieces of donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Regulation and inspection work
----------------------------------

Upon liaison with the Police, the Housing Department will start removing the burnt scaffolding on the external walls of Wang Cheong House, Wang Tai House and Wang Sun House this Friday (December 12). The Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau today continued to conduct further strengthening works in a small number of units that may be subject to more serious damage, including concrete grouting and erecting temporary props.

The ICU has inspected the scaffolding at the four Home Ownership Scheme courts, namely Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme. The contractor concerned has completed removing all the miscellaneous items on the scaffolding.

The order to remove scaffold nets issued by the Buildings Department (BD) has all been complied with. The BD will announce a new set of arrangements within this week that will require scaffold nets used at construction sites to be sampled on-site and certified as compliant with the relevant standards prior to installation, so that the relevant external wall work can resume as soon as possible.

The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 404 construction sites, issued a total of 210 written warnings and 104 improvement notices, and taken out 25 prosecutions."

醫院管理局就醫院重建及擴建工程監測震動儀器校正證明的聲明,2025-12-10 21:46,2025-12-10 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000735.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（十二月十日）就醫院重建及擴建工程的監測震動儀器校正證明作出以下聲明︰

醫管局昨日（十二月九日）向警方報告一宗懷疑偽造監測震動儀器校正證明的事件，交由警方作進一步調查。有關儀器校正證明由瑪嘉烈醫院荔景大樓擴建工程總承建商轄下一個分判商諾和工程公司呈交總承建商中鐵建設集團有限公司，再經總承建商呈交醫管局。其後經醫管局核查確認，該校正證明並非由證明書上所列的廣東中正航計量檢測有限公司所發出。

醫管局非常重視事件，已主動向警方報案，以及責成工程總承建商嚴肅跟進及徹查事件，並已要求總承建商暫停有關分判商諾和工程公司的工作。醫管局對違反醫院工程合約條款保留一切法律追究權利。

醫院在進行重建或擴建工程期間，會採取不同的措施監測震動的情況，以確保醫院工程所產生的震動不會對醫院運作及醫療服務構成影響。除在醫院工程地盤裝設監測震動儀器外，在有需要時亦會安排工程人員以手提儀器作監測。有關監測震動儀器一般會由承建商每年校正一次，確保監測數據準確無誤，承建商在校正後亦需提供認可的儀器校正證明。

醫管局發言人強調︰「有關監測震動儀器屬於預防性質，總承建商現時仍然會以手提儀器作監測。與此同時，我們亦會密切監察醫院工程附近使用者的反饋。如有醫護人員反映工程產生的震動影響服務，不論震動幅度有否超出規定，醫院均會以病人安全及醫療服務作為首要考慮，立即暫停有關工程。過去半年，醫管局沒有接獲任何醫院工程因為產生震動而需要暫停醫療服務的報告。」

發言人補充，醫管局已初步評估事件，沒有對醫療服務及病人安全造成影響。

醫管局非常重視轄下醫院工程的安全及管理，所有醫院工程合約均有訂明工程造成震動可承受參考水平，以確保工程不會對醫院運作及醫療服務構成影響。本局並將全面調查有關工程，重新核實包括有關工程的監測數據，以至上載數據的過程等。本局亦有嚴格要求，規定承建商必須採取措施，確保所有工程符合相關規定。本局的工程顧問會定期巡查，監督所有承建商執行相關規定的情況，以及核實相關標準。

諾和工程公司是多個醫院重建及擴建工程（包括瑪嘉烈醫院荔景大樓擴建工程）總承建商的其中一個負責包括震動監測的分判商，而北微傳感科技則為諾和工程公司提供震動監測儀器及相關儀器校正服務的分判商。

醫管局先於十月二十七日接獲北微傳感科技通知，指稱北微傳感科技與諾和工程公司的合約關係已經終止。在收到有關資訊後，醫管局即向各相關醫院建造工程的總承建商查詢，要求所有總承建商確保工程項目不受影響。醫管局亦同時責成各工程顧問及總承建商再次審視諾和工程公司承辦項目的表現；同時提醒總承建商必須做好監督工作，確保工程項目的質素符合標準及合約要求。本局亦要求所有總承建商委託合資格的專業檢測中心校正震動監測儀器及提交證明。

本局其後於十一月十五日接獲瑪嘉烈醫院荔景大樓總承建商提交，諾和工程公司早前向該總承建商呈交的五份校正證明，其中四份校準日期為二○二五年十月二十八日及一份校準日期為二○二四年十一月二十五日。期間本局於十一月十八日接獲「香港01」相關的查詢。基於審慎考慮，本局與校正證明書上所列負責認證的檢測機構確認相關校正證明的真確性。本局在十二月八日收到總承建商提交有關測試機構的函件，指出該機構並沒有發出有關校正證明，懷疑文件為偽造。

現時除了瑪嘉烈醫院荔景大樓外，諾和工程公司亦有承接其他醫院的監測震動工程，包括廣華醫院、聖母醫院、葛量洪醫院及北區醫院。諾和工程公司同時亦受聘於不同的總承建商，提供實時噪音及震動監測以及上載資料系統，以及噪音及沙塵監測計量儀器。因應上述事件，本局將會徹底全面檢視及追查所有醫院工程中與諾和工程公司有關的工程和服務，以及至目前為止收到所有與諾和工程公司有關的檢測證書。本局對造假行為採取零容忍態度，一旦發現造假行為，必定會交由警方進一步調查以及追討相關損失。

DH recorded another local case of chikungunya fever involving Tsing Yi Nature Trails and advises public not to visit the area,2025-12-10 20:57,2025-12-10 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000713.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 10), the CHP has recorded one new local case of chikungunya fever (CF), involving a patient who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails during the incubation period. The Tsing Yi Nature Trails is currently closed until further notice. The relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails. To avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering the mosquito control operations, members of the public should not enter the area.

Latest case information
------------------------------
 The case involves a 40-year-old male living in Tuen Mun District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he developed joint pain and a fever on December 4 and 5 respectively, followed by rash on December 7. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Tuen Mun Hospital yesterday (December 9) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

 The patient had no travel history during the incubation period. The case is classified as local. He hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails with 11 persons on November 30, and reportedly suffered mosquitoe bites there. Other than that, the CHP found no overlap between his activities during the incubation period and the locations visited by earlier confirmed cases. The CHP considered that the patient likely contracted the infection while hiking near Tsing Yi Nature Trails on that day, and that there is an epidemiological linkage between this case and the recent local cases in Tsing Yi. His household contact and the 11 hiking companions are currently asymptomatic. The CHP has implemented prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to the household contacts concerned. If necessary, the CHP will arrange for laboratory testing. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

 Hong Kong has recorded a total of 79 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Regarding some local cases of CF who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the CHP held an interdepartmental meeting with representatives from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), the Home Affairs Department, the Drainage Services Department (DSD), the Lands Department, and the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) on December 8, to further confirmed measures to strengthen mosquito prevention and control in the vicinity of the Tsing Yi Nature Trails.

The CHP continues to urge individuals not to visit the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373). The CHP yesterday issued another letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department and Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


ââThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

â
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生署再錄得一宗涉及青衣自然徑的基孔肯雅熱本地個案　忠告市民暫時不要到青衣自然徑,2025-12-10 20:00,2025-12-10 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000668.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月十日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱本地個案，患者亦曾在潛伏期內到過青衣自然徑。該自然徑目前已暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門近期會在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心再次忠告市民不應擅進，以免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名40歲男子，住所位於屯門區。初步調查顯示，他於十二月四日及五日先後出現關節痛及發燒，十二月七日出現皮疹，昨日（十二月九日）到屯門醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

病人在潛伏期內不曾外遊，屬本地感染個案。他於十一月三十日曾與11人到青衣自然徑遠足，據病人表示，其間他曾被蚊叮咬。除此以外，中心未發現他在潛伏期內的其他活動地點與早前確診個案曾到訪的地點有重疊。中心認為病人較大機會是於青衣自然徑一帶遠足時受感染，與近期青衣的本地個案有流行病學關連。他的家居接觸者及11名當日一同遠足的人士暫時沒有出現病徵。中心已按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為相關人士提供醫學監察及健康建議。如有需要，中心會安排化驗檢測。流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

本港今年累計錄得79宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

CHP investigates food poisoning cluster,2025-12-10 19:55,2025-12-10 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000677.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (December 10) investigating a food poisoning cluster affecting 31 persons. The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

The affected individuals, including 20 males and 11 females aged between two and 75, attended a Chinese wedding banquet at the Grand Ballroom of the New World Millennium Hong Kong Hotel, located at 72 Mody Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, on December 6. They developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea about two to 27 hours after dining.

One affected person sought medical advice.None of the affected individuals required hospitalisation and they are currently in stable condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the affected persons consumed several common food items at the aforementioned premises, including suckling pigs. Officers of the CHP and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch, conducted an investigation at the hotel. They inspected the food handling process and food hygiene. The CFS' field investigation revealed that the suckling pigs were prepared too early in advance, and may have been cross contaminated by raw food during storage. The suckling pigs were not thoroughly reheated either. The CFS instructed the hotel concerned to immediately stop serving the incriminated food items, clean and disinfect the premises, and provide food safety and environmental hygiene education to the staff. Food and environmental samples were collected for testing.

The investigation of the CHP and CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and
Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet.

During the operation, FEHD officers raided a licensed FPS at Yan King Road in Tseung Kwan O, and seized about 264 kilograms of suspected frozen beef and about 256kg of prepackaged frozen beef, which have been immediately marked and sealed for further investigation. Beef samples were also collected for the detection of preservatives. Prosecutions will be initiated should there be sufficient evidence. The licensee of the FPS is suspected of breaching the licensing conditions for the display and sale of frozen meat as fresh meat, and the FEHD is proceeding with the cancellation of the FPS's licence.

Prosecution was initiated against the licensee of the FPS for the dirty condition of the premises. Two verbal warnings were also given to the licensee for non-compliance with the relevant licensing conditions for failing to provide delivery notes for inspection and improper storage of frozen beef.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""The selling of chilled or frozen meat disguised as fresh meat breaches the licensing conditions and poses food safety risks. Such operations are unfair to other compliant businesses.""

The spokesman added, ""Anyone selling chilled or frozen meat without permission commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment on conviction. The FEHD will continue to conduct regular inspections at licensed FPSs and market meat stalls and will deal with complaints promptly. In detecting any irregularities, the department will carry out investigations promptly and take appropriate enforcement action. In addition, the FEHD also proactively investigates suspected violations from time to time and conducts surprise inspections and enforcement actions as necessary. If there is sufficient evidence, prosecutions will be initiated, and follow-up action will be taken against breaches of licensing conditions or tenancy agreements. The licences of those FPSs breaching licensing conditions may be cancelled, while the tenancies of market meat stalls breaching tenancy agreements may be terminated.""

The spokesman emphasised the FEHD's deep concern and strong commitment to combating the sale of chilled or frozen meat disguised as fresh meat through stringent enforcement actions."

They had exchanges with representatives from about 70 Mainland enterprises and industry associations to deepen the enterprises' understanding of the advantages of Hong Kong's professional services and promote Hong Kong to be their preferred platform for going global.

The exchange event was co-organised for the first time by the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the the Qianhai Authority of Shenzhen. This marked the second time Dr Cheung has led a cross-professional delegation for such direct exchanges with Mainland enterprises, following his visit to Guangzhou to meet with senior executives of Guangdong enterprises in June, to promote the role of Hong Kong's professional services in supporting Mainland enterprises to expand overseas.

Dr Cheung said that the 15th Five-Year Plan, focusing on high-quality development and expanding the scope of high-level opening up, presents Hong Kong with historic opportunities. Noting that Hong Kong's internationalised professional services perfectly complement the country's development needs, he encouraged the professional service sectors to seize the enormous business opportunities brought by Mainland enterprises in going global to create strong impetus for growth and achieve mutual benefits.

Dr Cheung mentioned that it is clearly stated in the 2025 Policy Address that Hong Kong should capitalise on its role as a platform for ""going global"" in which he is tasked to promote Hong Kong's legal services and to collaborate with other professional service sectors, such as accounting and finance, to support Mainland enterprises wishing to expand overseas.

Members of the DoJ's Advisory Group of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Lawyers and representatives from Hong Kong's accounting sector gave thematic presentations on the framework enhancement for Mainland enterprises in going global and cross-cultural compliance, as well as on leveraging Hong Kong's professional services such as accounting and taxation services for better planning and risk management. After that, delegation members held roundtable discussions on common legal issues faced by enterprises expanding overseas - such as investment planning, trade barriers, intellectual property protection, corporate compliance, and cross-border dispute resolution - and engaged in free exchanges on different topics with Mainland enterprise representatives from various industries.

Dr Cheung said that the visit marked an important step for Hong Kong's professional services sectors to work together with Mainland enterprises to go global together. He highlighted four key features of this event. The first feature is the diverse professional backgrounds of participants, including accountants, barristers, lawyers from Mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and international law firms, as well as Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) practising lawyers. The second feature is the broad expertise of delegation members, covering professional fields such as corporate investment, financing, compliance, intellectual property protection, and cross-border dispute resolution, showcasing Hong Kong's comprehensive capabilities in supporting Mainland enterprises' overseas development. The third features is the large participation of Mainland enterprises covering various potential industries, including finance, information technology, manufacturing, retail, and cultural and sports entertainment that have participated in this activity. The fourth feature is that this marked the first time for Shenzhen and Hong Kong to jointly organise such a collaborative event aiming to explore more effective modes for connecting Mainland enterprises with Hong Kong's professional services.

To deepen the understanding of the latest developments in the judicial system and the handling of foreign-related civil and commercial cases on the Mainland, the delegation also visited the First Circuit Court of the Supreme People's Court and the Shenzhen Centre for Foreign Law Ascertainment which serves as a comprehensive legal service platform designed to assist Mainland enterprises in going global.

Dr Cheung and the delegation returned to Hong Kong after the event in the evening."

It is preliminarily suspected that the incident involved an illegal fuelling station. The EPD is conducting follow-up and enforcement actions in collaboration with the relevant departments.

  Upon receiving reports from members of the public and the Drainage Services Department (DSD) on December 8, the EPD immediately initiated investigations and follow-up actions. The EPD and the DSD quickly placed oil absorption materials at multiple locations along the nullah to contain the spread of oil, and conducted clean-up operations to mitigate environmental impact and safeguard the surrounding ecosystem. In-situ water quality monitoring was carried out, and the results confirmed that the water quality parameters remained within the normal range, with no fish deaths detected.

  Based on the EPD's further investigation, the oil spill incident was suspected to be related to an illegal fuelling station on Tin Ha Road, Yuen Long. The department is currently collecting evidence with a view to instituting prosecutions against those responsible parties for the illegal discharge. The case relating to the illegal fuelling station has also been referred to relevant departments for follow-up action.

  An EPD spokesman said that the department will not tolerate any acts of environmental pollution and will take stringent enforcement actions against those who violate environmental legislation. The EPD will continue to closely monitor the water quality of the Tin Shui Wai Nullah and, in collaboration with the DSD, carry on with clean-up operations in the nullah."

Following are Mr Cheuk’s remarks:

Reporter: Does the Government intend to redevelop the Tai Po site, and how will authorities settle the affected residents in the long run? And how much, in number terms, from the fund will be needed to do so? And as of today, how much is left in the $3.4 billion fund, and how can the fund’s transparency be assured? And how is the progress on forming the independent committee? The government mentioned it was looking for a judge a few days ago. So when will the committee start working and investigating? Can you tell us the timeline? Thank you.

Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration: I try to respond to your questions, not particularly in the order you asked those questions. I think the forming of the independent committee is being very vigorously pursued. And I think at the appropriate juncture, the Government will make the announcement.

  As regards how much is left in in our Support Fund (Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po) for helping the persons affected by the fire, I just mentioned that so far, our commitment is about $460 million. So we have about $2.8 billion left in the Support Fund. And what's your first and second question?

Reporter: The intention of the Tai Po site. Will it be redeveloped as considered?

Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration: I also did mention that the Chief Executive has asked the Deputy Financial Secretary to look into the long-term housing and accommodation needs of the victims of this fire. So I think there are obviously many possibilities, and there are different options, many factors to consider, and I think the ultimate use of the fire site will depend on what are the propositions that we come up with. So it has to await that side of the work to be complete.

根據信託聲明，「援助基金」設有督導委員會。督導委員會由我領導，就基金的運作等事宜作出建議，並督導和監察基金轄下援助項目的設立和推行情況。督導委員會由各有關政策局的局長和部門首長組成，成員包括：民政及青年事務局局長、勞工及福利局局長、教育局局長、房屋局局長和醫務衞生局局長等。庫務署署長擔任「援助基金」的會計師，負責現金流管理及備存會計帳目和記錄。基金的帳目將按照香港法例第1044章的規定呈交審計署署長進行審計，而「援助基金」的報告也會提交立法會省覽。

督導委員會以至全政府都會本着同一宗旨，就是確保籌集所得的善款都用得其所，全數用於協助居民應付困境，並提供中長期的支援，協助他們重過新生活、重建家園。因此，各政策局及部門為「援助基金」提供的行政支援及執行「援助基金」項目的相關開支，將由有關政策局或部門自行承擔，不會向基金要求回撥成本。

對各界善長及普羅市民的慷慨捐獻，我們深表感謝。至今收到的31億元善款，是來自26萬3千多宗捐款。當中，一萬元以下的捐款有約27萬7千宗（應為25萬7千宗），500萬元以上的捐款有約170宗，佔31億元捐款中的17億元。政府會於下星期起處理向捐款者發放捐款收據的事宜，詳情我們稍後公布。一如其他慈善捐款，上述對「援助基金」的捐獻是可以獲得稅務寬減。為感謝各善長和方便市民，今次稅務局會特事特辦，五萬元或以下的捐款，若以轉帳方式過戶至基金戶口，只要保留有關捐款記錄，以作核實，亦可獲稅務寬減。

在今日督導委員會的正式會議上，我們通過了一項特別補助予宏福苑業主，就是向每個單位的業主發放一次性的10萬元補助。現時在「援助基金」下推出的支援主要是以住戶為對象，部分住戶是租戶而非業主。我們在過去一段時間探訪和接觸受影響居民的過程中，了解到有業主依靠出租宏福苑單位的收入應付日常開支，火災令他們失去這筆收入，亦有業主早前亦投入了一定資金為單位進行裝修和維修，因此也有損失和現金流壓力。有關資助以宏福苑單位為對象，因此即使有單位有超過一名業主，我們以每戶計算，補助額都是10萬元。

剛才說過，截至今日「援助基金」的總額約為34億元，我想告知大家，各項已經公布緊急援助項目（包括剛公布給業主的特別補助）的承擔額約為4億6千多萬元。就向受災人士發放款項方面，我們向死者家屬發放20萬元慰問金及5萬元殮葬金的數目是106宗、向每戶受影響家庭發放10萬元生活津貼的數目是1 617宗、向每名受傷人士發放5萬至10萬元受傷補助的數目是64宗，另外發放2萬元補助給宏福苑外藉家庭傭工、學生和工友的數目，分別是63、220和110宗。

除緊急援助外，正如剛才所說，「援助基金」也會提供中長期的支援予居民，協助他們走出困境和重過新生活。各相關政策局及部門會在這方面繼續進行研究，並適時向督導委員會提交建議。我的匯報到此。

記者：想問之前政府為死者家屬提供20萬元慰問金和為每戶受影響住戶提供10萬元生活津貼，會否考慮提高金額？謝謝。

政務司副司長：我先回答，再看看麥局長有沒有補充。我們其實在過去這段日子提出了各項補助金，亦已經因應居民的需要而發放，這是一個持續的過程，如果我們繼續接觸時發現他們有其他需要，我們會考慮需要支援的方案。

記者：剛才說了一些數字，可否有一個確實的數字反映現時市民的捐款用了多少錢？未來的安排為何？會否向公眾交代如果有錢剩下，如何安排善後的支援？多謝。

政務司副司長：剛才所說的承擔額，為4億6千多萬元。這個金額未用完，我們看到各方面派發補助金的進展是良好的。至於你覺得如果有用剩的（捐款），會如何處理？我們不斷強調，我們給予受災居民的支援是持續的，並會涉及中長期的支援。大家亦知道，行政長官已指派應急住宿安排工作組，研究宏福苑居民的長期住屋和居住的問題。在這方面，我們亦要看看屆時會有甚麼方案出來，如果有此需要時，基金會如何作出配合。

記者：你好，想請教外界有人關注，這次火災，政府都有大量援助，但如果日後不幸再有火災發生，其實政府的援助機制會否都是一樣，還是今次只是因應這件事件特事特辦？正常機制是如何？另外，剛剛有提過其實今次再有一個新（補助）發放給業主，想知道短期的支援措施是否就是這麼多？整個基金會否說是預留多少成資金用作中長期的援助？謝謝。

政務司副司長：其實火災發生到現在，時間都不是很長，我們一直推出幫助市民的援助措施。是否現在已經做得差不多？我不可以這樣說，一定會因應新的問題、新的需要，我們要適時提供協助。至於你說我們現在的種種安排，或將來有類似的情況會怎樣，這是一個假設性問題。這次確實有很多事情特事特辦，但我相信每一件事，如果有這麼不幸的事情發生，我們都要按當時的情況處理。

民政及青年事務局局長︰我想補充，大家要記得這次火警發生至今，政府以往在處理事故時，有既定機制或援助機制，這些是一般會有的，但是我想大家都同意，今次規模之大，受影響人數之多，對社會造成的影響，故政府今次採取了很多、如剛才政務司副司長所說的特事特辦，亦用了很多方法盡快、彈性幫助受影響的居民和災民。至於將來，最重要是怎樣預防這些不幸的事故再次發生，我們要避免、預防，而不是去想將來怎樣再處理。這就是為何特首在成立三個工作小組時，其中一個是調查和規管的工作組，調查規管工作做得好，就希望不會再發生不幸事故。

而這次大家看到整個政府不同部門，正如政務司副司長剛才介紹，無論是基金的處理，我們得到庫務署等不同部門快速的協助，處理二十多萬個捐款交易，我們要怎樣去處理那些個案等等，無論是社會福利署的社工同事，又或是勞工處，又譬如教育局，所有牽涉的同事，大家都很彈性地處理盡快發款的方法。所以簡單來說，面對將來，我們第一時間一定要想，怎樣避免再有這些事故發生。第二，在處理這次火警時，整個善後工作，我們已用了超出一般的處理方法。政府固然對事故有既定機制，但這次我們要做的已超出了一般做法。同事和不同部門都是多走一步，希望幫助受影響居民。

Remarks by DCS at media session (with video),2025-12-10 17:18,2025-12-10 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000542.htm,"  The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, together with the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, met the media today (December 10) on the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Following are Mr Cheuk’s remarks:

Reporter: Does the Government intend to redevelop the Tai Po site, and how will authorities settle the affected residents in the long run? And how much, in number terms, from the fund will be needed to do so? And as of today, how much is left in the $3.4 billion fund, and how can the fund’s transparency be assured? And how is the progress on forming the independent committee? The government mentioned it was looking for a judge a few days ago. So when will the committee start working and investigating? Can you tell us the timeline? Thank you.

Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration: I try to respond to your questions, not particularly in the order you asked those questions. I think the forming of the independent committee is being very vigorously pursued. And I think at the appropriate juncture, the Government will make the announcement.

  As regards how much is left in in our Support Fund (Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po) for helping the persons affected by the fire, I just mentioned that so far, our commitment is about $460 million. So we have about $2.8 billion left in the Support Fund. And what's your first and second question?

Reporter: The intention of the Tai Po site. Will it be redeveloped as considered?

Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration: I also did mention that the Chief Executive has asked the Deputy Financial Secretary to look into the long-term housing and accommodation needs of the victims of this fire. So I think there are obviously many possibilities, and there are different options, many factors to consider, and I think the ultimate use of the fire site will depend on what are the propositions that we come up with. So it has to await that side of the work to be complete.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"
"DH's Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute opens its permanent premises, offering free guided tours of Chinese Medicines Herbarium and medicinal plant garden starting tomorrow (with photos)",2025-12-10 17:05,2025-12-10 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000355.htm,"âThe permanent premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI) under the Department of Health (DH) will commence phased operations tomorrow (December 11). Equipped with advanced technology and equipment, the new premises will enhance the ability to develop Chinese medicines (CM) testing methods and standard development capabilities, supporting the comprehensive and high-quality development of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong. The Chinese Medicines Herbarium, which opens in the first phase, showcases approximately 3 500 CM specimens, including a number of precious specimens gifted to Hong Kong by the national authorities. Together with the outdoor medicinal plant garden, the Shennong Herbal Garden, these facilities will be available for group reservations for free guided tours starting tomorrow.

The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, said, ""Established in 2017, the GCMTI under the DH is dedicated to establishing internationally recognised reference standards for CM and their testing methods. Through technology transfer, the GCMTI shares its achievements to assist the industry in adopting advanced technologies to enhance CM product quality and strengthen quality control in production. The opening of the permanent premises will allow for more efficient use of resources. This will further promote the enhancement of CM quality in Hong Kong, strengthen local and international co-operation and exchange, and promote high-quality development of Chinese medicine to go global.""

The permanent premises of the GCMTI are located at 3 Pak Shing Kok Road in Tseung Kwan O, adjacent to The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong, representing two flagship institutions for the development of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong. The new building features the following four key components:

1. State-of-the-art laboratories
Equipped with four specialties of advanced laboratories and over 3 300 pieces of laboratory equipment and information technology equipment, the laboratories will utilise cutting-edge technology to support the development of innovative, faster, more accurate, and highly versatile testing methods for CM.

2. International Collaboration and Training Centre
Featuring multidisciplinary training and technology transfer laboratories, the new premises are designed to strengthen exchange and collaboration with relevant Mainland and international organisations in the field of CM testing technologies. It also serves as a training base for DH to support its role as the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine.

3. Chinese Medicines Herbarium and Laboratories (CMHL)
The CMHL will exhibit about 3 500 specimens. Among them are over 300 representative and precious specimens from various regions, gifted by the National Medical Products Administration. These include giant wild Astragali Radix and Cistanches Herba. Through the systematic display of these specimens, visitors will be able to understand the complete lifecycle of CM, from source plants and Chinese medicinal materials to decoction pieces ready for clinical applications and proprietary Chinese medicines (pCm), thereby enhancing public knowledge of and interest in CM. The CMHL has a special design that allows visitors to observe the work inside the laboratories. Schools and groups interested in visiting may make reservations via email at gcmti@dh.gov.hk starting from tomorrow.

4. Shennong Herbal Garden
Covering approximately 700 square metres, this medicinal plant garden showcases around 180 species of medicinal plants, with a storyline on Lingnan region's ""Local Herbal Tea"" and ""Seasonal Soup"". It aims to promote Chinese medicine culture and knowledge while actively advocating healthy lifestyles. Currently, the Shennong Herbal Garden is only open for school and group reservations (same reservation method as above), with public access to be announced later.

One of the GCMTI's key accomplishments is the implementation of the Hong Kong Chinese Materia Medica Standards, covering reference standards for over 340 Chinese Materia Medica (CMM) to date. Supported by the GCMTI's Advisory Committee, the GCMTI has also completed dozens of thematic projects that utilise cutting-edge technologies, including the development of versatile testing methods for chemical markers in pCm, micro-morphological identifications of CM, and the establishment of a three-dimensional (3D) image database for traceable medicinal materials through photogrammetry. The phased commissioning of the new building's facilities marks a comprehensive upgrade of the DH in CM testing, standard setting and technology transfer.

Dr Lam added, ""With the new premises, our multidisciplinary team of experts will continue to actively promote the inheritance and innovative development of Chinese medicine, deepening its integration into the national development strategy in Chinese medicine and fostering the comprehensive, high-quality development of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong. This new facility will not only serve as a hub for CM testing and standard setting but will also bear the important responsibility of disseminating Chinese medicine culture. Through the CM specimens, the Shennong Herbal Garden and professional guided tours, we will bridge the gap between the public and Chinese medicine.""

Specimens of the GCMTI and its global-first 3D CMM images can be viewed at the Digital Herbarium for Chinese Medicines (www.cmherbarium.gov.hk)."
十一月份白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數持續處於低水平,2025-12-10 17:00,2025-12-10 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000313.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（十二月十日）公布，十一月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之零點九，較十月份的百分之二點二為低，反映相關政府部門持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，使本月的整體蚊患情況較上月有所改善。此外，食環署已加強白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數的資訊發放，讓更多市民可更快掌握蚊患情況，並會繼續進行控蚊工作，以進一步降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱的傳播風險。

十一月份，全部64個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平。十一月份的每月誘蚊器指數及分區誘蚊器指數的回落，是由於各政府部門及持份者持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，亦有機會受天氣等因素影響。十一月份的總雨量為7.0毫米，較十月份的31.2毫米及九月份的528.7毫米大幅下降。整體而言，十一月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之零點九，屬於一級水平（顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布並不廣泛），各相關部門及持份者仍會持續進行控蚊工作。

另外，十一月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點一，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一點一隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。雖然指數維持於低水平，但蚊子在冬季仍會繁殖和活動，食環署會持續監察各區的蚊患情況，並採取迅速有效的防治措施。

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署已加強資訊發放，並通過新聞公報及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

為降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱等蚊傳疾病的傳播風險，食環署繼續在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，並在病者的住所及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署今年繼續分三期進行全港滅蚊運動，第三期滅蚊運動已於十月二十四日結束。其間，食環署各分區辦事處針對區內一些受關注的地點，例如公眾街巿、熟食中心、小販巿場、單幢式樓宇、街道和後巷、大廈的公用地方、村屋、建築地盤、空置土地及路旁工地等，進行一連串的清除積水及防治蚊患行動。為進一步加強滅蚊的成效，食環署已聯同相關部門，於五月七日起展開第二期全城防蚊及滅蚊行動，除繼續第一期工作，包括清除潛在蚊子滋生地外，食環署呼籲私人物業管理公司及早維修處所，以減少蚊子滋生地，並開始定期以超低微量噴灑方式殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境以徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。此外，根據世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至九月，全球40個國家／地區共錄得超過44萬宗個案。鄰近地區登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"
Monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in November remains at low level,2025-12-10 17:00,2025-12-10 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000310.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (December 10) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index (MGI) for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in November was 0.9 per cent, lower than the 2.2 per cent recorded in October. This reflects the continued efforts by relevant government departments to intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations, resulting in the improvement of the overall mosquito infestation situation this month. In addition, the FEHD has strengthened the dissemination of information on the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes so that more citizens can quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation. The department will continue its mosquito control work to further reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

  In November, all 64 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index (AGI) lower than the alert level of 20 per cent. The decreases in the MGI and the AGI are attributable to the continuous and intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations by various government departments and stakeholders, and may also have been affected by factors such as weather. The monthly rainfall was 7.0 millimetres in November, showing a substantial decrease from the 31.2mm in October and 528.7mm in September. Overall, the MGI for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in November was 0.9 per cent, at Level 1 (indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was not extensive). Relevant departments and stakeholders will persistently intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations.

  Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in November was 1.1, which represented that an average of 1.1 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas. Although the index remains at a low level, the breeding and activity of mosquitoes will not stop in winter. The FEHD will continue to monitor the mosquito infestation in all districts, and will conduct prompt and effective mosquito prevention and control work.

  The FEHD currently makes regular announcements on gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD has strengthened information dissemination by promptly announcing the latest gravidtrap indexes through press releases and social media.

  In addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of CF, the FEHD has extended the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI falling between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks and, in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together to take mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

  To reduce the risk of transmission of CF and DF, the FEHD continues to step up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts and conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within a 250-metre radius of the residence of patients and the places patients had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

  The FEHD has continuously conducted a three-phase Anti-mosquito Campaign this year. The third phase of the territory-wide campaign was concluded on October 24. During the period, the district offices of the FEHD targeted areas that had drawn particular concern, such as public markets, cooked food centres, hawker bazaars, single-block buildings, streets and back lanes, common parts of buildings, village houses, construction sites, vacant sites and road works sites, to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work. To further enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control, the FEHD and relevant government departments have carried out the second phase of the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations since May 7. In addition to continuing the work of the first phase, including eliminating potential mosquito breeding grounds, the FEHD urges private property management companies to attend to their premises as soon as possible to minimise mosquito breeding places and to begin eradicating adult mosquitoes by means of regular ultra-low volume fogging operations.

  The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  Aedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit DF and CF. DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. Furthermore, according to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of September, over 440 000 cases had been reported in 40 countries/regions worldwide. The DF and CF activities in neighbouring areas have remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 9 to noon today (December 10), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 201 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

A spokesman for the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) said, ""The MSSY is one of the key initiatives for youth development as set out in the Chief Executive's 2022 Policy Address and the Youth Development Blueprint. To engage more young people in public affairs and enhance their interaction with and trust in the Government, action has been taken to expand the MSSY, with a view to increasing the number of participating advisory committees from around 60 in 2022 to no less than 180 within the current term of the Government. At present, about 650 posts are held by young people who have been appointed to various advisory and statutory bodies of the Government, directly or indirectly, through the MSSY. The overall ratio of youth members in these bodies has increased from 7.8 per cent in end-2017 to 15.5 per cent in end-2024.""

The MSSY has received an enthusiastic response since its launch. From the Pilot Scheme to Phase 8 of the MSSY, a total of about 14 000 applications have been received so far. The list of appointees has been uploaded to thewebsiteof the HYAB.

The MSSY Phase 9 is now open for application. The participating committees for the MSSY Phase 9 are as follows:

"Extending Closed Road Permit validity period and adjusting fees from January 1, 2026",2025-12-10 12:33,2025-12-10 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000332.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (December 10) that, starting from January 1, 2026, all submitted applications for a Closed Road Permit (CRP) for cross-boundary vehicles will be issued with a longer validity period to better align with the validity period of respective cross-boundary quotas or up to 60 months at most, whichever is shorter, providing additional convenience and efficiency for cross-boundary travel as quota holders need not apply for annual renewals.

  In addition, from the same day, the CRP fees will also be adjusted based on the cost-recovery principle:




Vehicle type
Fee per month for CRP valid for less than 12 months
			($) (Note)
Flat rate fees for CRP valid for 12 to 60 months
			($)


Private car
62
744


Goods vehicle or bus
49
588



Note: Any part of a month counting as one month

  For applications received on or before December 31, 2025, the validity period of the CRP issued will remain no more than 12 months, and the CRP fees will be kept at the existing levels.

  To streamline processes, from January 1, 2026, cross-boundary private cars permitted to use more than one land-based boundary control point (BCP) will be issued with a single CRP covering all BCPs concerned.

  A spokesman for the TD said that the Government is committed to enhancing the CRP arrangements to bring greater convenience to cross-boundary travellers. Under the new arrangements, most CRP holders will benefit from less frequent renewals and a lower aggregated amount of CRP fee payable. Of note, vehicles approved to participate in the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles, the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles or other designated cross-boundary driving schemes have been exempted from applying for CRPs and will not be affected by the fee adjustment.

  For enquiries, members of the public may call the TD's hotline at 2804 2600 for details."
二○二六年一月一日起封閉道路通行許可證延長有效期並調整收費,2025-12-10 12:10,2025-12-10 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000319.htm,"運輸署今日（十二月十日）公布，為進一步便利跨境車輛出行，由二○二六年一月一日起，所有遞交的跨境車輛封閉道路通行許可證（許可證）申請將可獲發較長有效期，以更有效配合個別跨境配額的有效期，最長可達60個月（以較短者為準），讓配額持有人無需每年為許可證續期，提高效率。

此外，由同日起，許可證費用亦會按收回成本的原則調整：




車種
少於12個月的許可證每月費用
			（元）（註）
12至60個月的許可證劃一費用
			（元）


私家車
62
744


貨車或巴士

588



註：不足一個月當作一個月計

至於在二○二五年十二月三十一日或之前接獲的申請，獲發的許可證有效期維持不多於12個月，並按現行水平收費。

The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 750 square metres on the roof of an industrial building on Hung To Road, Kwun Tong. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (December 10), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

Coin Collection Programme,2025-12-10 11:00,2025-12-10 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000251.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

âThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (December 10) announced a new service schedule of the two ""Coin Carts"" under the Coin Collection Programme, for the period of January5, 2026 up to March22, 2026. The schedule and other details of the Programme are shown on the HKMA webpage (coincollection.hkma.gov.hk).

Since the launch of the Programme in October 2014 up to November30, 2025, the two Coin Carts had carried out 1 427 000 transactions, collecting 1 088 million coins with a total face value of HK$1,755 million during the period. The collected coins are re-circulated to meet demand.

The Coin Carts provide service at locations that are convenient to the public without affecting the normal flow of traffic and pedestrians. Locations that have suitable power supply facilities, such as the Leisure and Cultural Services Department mobile library service locations, are preferred so as to reduce the need for using the Coin Carts' own stand-by generators. This makes the Programme more environmentally friendly. In selecting the service locations, the HKMA has taken into consideration comments and suggestions given by district councils and members of public; and has consulted the Transport Department and the Hong Kong Police Force as necessary.

The two Coin Carts collect coins from members of public in the 18 districts of Hong Kong on a rotating basis. Under normal circumstances each Coin Cart will stay at a location for a week, subject to availability of the parking space and the maintenance schedule of the Cart. Service hours are from 10am to 7pm. Each vehicle is equipped with two coin counting machines and operational staff will be present to provide assistance. An electrical wheelchair lift is available for use. Users can choose to exchange coins for banknotes or adding value to their stored value facilities, such as Octopus Cards or e-wallets (including AlipayHK, Octopus Wallet, Tap&Go and WeChat Pay). There is also a Community Chest donation box inside each vehicle. The coin collection service is free of charge.

The HKMA will review the Programme from time to time; and will regularly update the service schedule to give advance notice to the public."

Professor Teng (President of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), Professor Teng Jin-guang), Professor Yang (Director of PAAI of PolyU, Professor Yang Qiang), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 On this day of the opening of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Academy for Artificial Intelligence, I am pleased to witness another accomplishment of the PolyU, one of the city's leading tertiary institutions, in promoting global collaboration and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI).

 The country's Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan reaffirm Hong Kong's strategic position as the international innovation and technology centre. Our vision to become a global hub for AI development was underscored in the 2025 Policy Address delivered by our Chief Executive, with promotion of AI being top of our agenda, taken forward through multi-pronged measures on key enablers, including talent, data, industry applications, and more.

 Talents are vital in driving the growth of AI. Supported by landmark programmes such as the AIR@InnoHK research cluster, Hong Kong has gathered over a thousand AI and robotic experts worldwide. New initiatives like the Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme fortify our talent pool by attracting world-class scholars and scientists to Hong Kong and provide a nurturing and thought-provoking environment to foster technological breakthroughs in frontier fields, including AI and quantum information.

 Data is indispensable to AI training and innovation. Secure and trusted flow of data is key. With Hong Kong's unique position under ""One Country, Two Systems"", we are privileged to leverage our distinct advantages in being a meeting point of voluminous amount of data from different places and use cases.

 On this front, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding two years ago in June 2023 with the Cyberspace Administration of China on cross-boundary data flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Specific measures were launched to promote the secure and orderly transfer of personal data within the GBA, facilitating more transparent cross-border flow and use of data.

 Besides, the Government is exploring with relevant Mainland authorities to establish a mechanism to allow cross-boundary flow of research data from the Mainland to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, thereby supporting, among others, the development of AI and application of big data.

 In parallel, we endeavour to broaden the impact of AI across industries by realising potentials through practical AI applications. Closely following the national strategy of ""AI+"" unveiled last year, the Government's pursuit of the dual objectives of ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"" seeks to embed AI application in both public and private sectors. 

 Taking on the leading role to implement AI in public services, the Digital Policy Office of the Government is introducing AI solutions in areas such as data analytics, customer service and document processing, ensuring that applications are both extensive and secure. Where strong business cases exist, government departments are also encouraged to develop their own tailored AI solutions. 

 On infrastructure, we are also forging ahead to set up the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute (AIRDI) next year. With the mission to link up the academia, industry and government on AI innovation and skill development, the AIRDI will encourage research and breakthroughs in the field of AI, take forward the transformation of research and development outcomes, and enrich application scenarios. I am also happy to share with all of you that a site at Sandy Ridge of Northern Metropolis has also been put to tender in the market for the development of a data facility cluster. We hope this will further strengthen Hong Kong's position as a regional digital infrastructure hub, and advance the development of a digital economy and smart city initiatives.

 With AI influencing every segment of our society, the inauguration of the PolyU Academy for AI marks not just a milestone, but a new chapter in our city's united efforts to expedite the AI development. I am confident that this Academy could inspire ideas, foster collaboration and fuel Hong Kong's AI ecosystem. Thank you."
Speech by SITI at PolyU Academy of Artificial Intelligence Inauguration (English only),2025-12-10 10:40,2025-12-10 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000238.htm,"  Following is a speech by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, at the PolyU Academy of Artificial Intelligence (PAAI) Inauguration today (December 10):

Professor Teng (President of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), Professor Teng Jin-guang), Professor Yang (Director of PAAI of PolyU, Professor Yang Qiang), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 On this day of the opening of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Academy for Artificial Intelligence, I am pleased to witness another accomplishment of the PolyU, one of the city's leading tertiary institutions, in promoting global collaboration and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI).

 The country's Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan reaffirm Hong Kong's strategic position as the international innovation and technology centre. Our vision to become a global hub for AI development was underscored in the 2025 Policy Address delivered by our Chief Executive, with promotion of AI being top of our agenda, taken forward through multi-pronged measures on key enablers, including talent, data, industry applications, and more.

 Talents are vital in driving the growth of AI. Supported by landmark programmes such as the AIR@InnoHK research cluster, Hong Kong has gathered over a thousand AI and robotic experts worldwide. New initiatives like the Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme fortify our talent pool by attracting world-class scholars and scientists to Hong Kong and provide a nurturing and thought-provoking environment to foster technological breakthroughs in frontier fields, including AI and quantum information.

 Data is indispensable to AI training and innovation. Secure and trusted flow of data is key. With Hong Kong's unique position under ""One Country, Two Systems"", we are privileged to leverage our distinct advantages in being a meeting point of voluminous amount of data from different places and use cases.

 On this front, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding two years ago in June 2023 with the Cyberspace Administration of China on cross-boundary data flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Specific measures were launched to promote the secure and orderly transfer of personal data within the GBA, facilitating more transparent cross-border flow and use of data.

 Besides, the Government is exploring with relevant Mainland authorities to establish a mechanism to allow cross-boundary flow of research data from the Mainland to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, thereby supporting, among others, the development of AI and application of big data.

 In parallel, we endeavour to broaden the impact of AI across industries by realising potentials through practical AI applications. Closely following the national strategy of ""AI+"" unveiled last year, the Government's pursuit of the dual objectives of ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"" seeks to embed AI application in both public and private sectors. 

 Taking on the leading role to implement AI in public services, the Digital Policy Office of the Government is introducing AI solutions in areas such as data analytics, customer service and document processing, ensuring that applications are both extensive and secure.
