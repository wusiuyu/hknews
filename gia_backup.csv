今屆陸家嘴論壇以「全球經濟變局中的金融開放合作與高質量發展」為主題。許正宇昨日出席了論壇的開幕式暨全體大會，而今日則在香港金融發展局與上海巿金融穩定發展研究中心聯合發布《新時期滬港國際金融中心協同發展報告》的研討會上致辭。

許正宇昨日參與全體大會四：《深化上海與香港國際金融中心合作發展》的專題研討環節時說：「憑藉『滬深港通』的成功基礎，內地與香港金融巿場互聯互通近年不斷增量擴容，多個項目相繼落實，包括『債券通』、交易所買賣基金納入互聯互通標的及『互換通』等。各個項目不但豐富境內外投資者的產品選擇，更有利吸引更多資金流入兩地的資本市場，推進市場的長遠發展。」

「與此同時，香港需要進一步增強離岸人民幣市場功能，便利來自世界各地的市場參與者使用人民幣。為此，我們會在加強離岸人民幣流動性、增加產品、完善基礎設施和開拓新市場四個方面加大力度。」

在談及穩定幣和央行數碼貨幣時，許正宇指出，穩定幣利用私營機構的創新能力，結合金融體系和實體經濟，為數字經濟創造新用例。香港的穩定幣監管框架兼顧創新與系統性風險防範，包括建立透明的儲備資產制度、訂明獨立第三方機構進行定期審計的要求和建立風險評估機制等。另外，香港金融管理局目前正與業界進行批發層面央行數碼貨幣的初期研究工作。

「未來，我們期望與上海在金融創新、綠色金融等方面加強合作，發揮協同效應。」

昨日上午，許正宇代表香港特別行政區政府與上海市簽署了《滬港國際金融中心協同發展行動方案》，以推動協同發展，進一步形成上海和香港兩個金融中心「雙樞紐」格局，更好推動人民幣國際化，共同助力金融強國建設。方案內容涵蓋多項舉措，包括支持上海清算所加強與香港銀行和在港境外中資銀行的合作，支持以上海為總部的內地銀行和金融機構在港設立區域總部和推動香港的轉數快系統與內地的網上支付跨行清算系統互聯等。

在上海期間，許正宇亦到訪多個金融機構，包括上海黃金交易所、上海清算所和上海期貨交易所，又與中國銀行（香港）副總裁王化斌和交通銀行行長張寶江會面，就推動香港黃金市場發展、強化離岸人民幣中心功能、促進與內地金融衍生品和期貨巿場協同發展等討論和交流，探討合作空間和模式。

許正宇今日下午返港。"
SFST attends Lujiazui Forum to foster collaborative development of Shanghai and Hong Kong (with photos),2025-06-19 15:03,2025-06-19 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900322.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, attended the 2025 Lujiazui Forum and related events in Shanghai yesterday (June 18) and today (June 19). Addressing a seminar titled ""Collaborative Development of Shanghai and Hong Kong International Financial Centres"" today (June 19), he said that Hong Kong and Shanghaiare unlocking many more new opportunities for collaborative development with their positions as the country's ""dual engine"" financial centres, providing strong support for the country's ""dual circulation"" strategy. Mr Hui also met with relevant heads of financial institutions during his stay in Shanghai.

This year's Lujiazui Forum is themed ""Financial Opening-up and Cooperation for High-Quality Development in a Changing Global Economy"". Mr Hui attended the opening ceremony and plenary session of the Forum yesterday and addressed today's seminar where the Hong Kong Financial Services Development Council and the Shanghai Research Center for Financial Stability and Development jointly released a research report on the ""Synergistic Development of Shanghai and Hong Kong as International Financial Centres in the New Era"".

Speaking at the Plenary Session IV titled ""Deepening the Cooperation between Shanghai and Hong Kong as International Financial Centers"" yesterday, Mr Hui said, ""Riding on the solid foundation of Stock Connect, mutual-market access between financial markets on the Mainland and Hong Kong has been expanding in scope and capacity. Programmes such as Bond Connect, the inclusion of Exchange Traded Funds into Stock Connect, and Swap Connect have been implemented. These programmes enhance not only the product offering for domestic and foreign investors but also the attraction for more capital influx into the capital markets of the two places, promoting long-term development of the markets.

""At the same time, Hong Kong needs to further enrich the offerings of its offshore Renminbi (RMB) market to facilitate the adoption of RMB by global market participants. To this end, we will step up efforts in four areas, namely enhancing offshore RMB liquidity, increasing products, improving infrastructure, and expanding new markets.""

When talking about stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), Mr Hui pointed out that by utilising the innovative capabilities of private institutions, stablecoins are meant to create and implement new use cases for the digital economy with the integration of the financial system with the real economy. Hong Kong's stablecoin regulatory framework takes into account both innovation and systemic risk prevention, covering the establishment of a transparent reserve asset system, the introduction of independent third-party institutions for regular audits, and the establishment of risk assessment mechanisms. Separately, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is currently engaging the industry to carry out initial exploration on wholesale CBDCs.

""In future, we anticipate closer collaboration with Shanghai in areas such as financial innovation and green finance to achieve synergy effects.""

Yesterday morning, Mr Hui signed the Action Plan for Collaborative Development of Shanghai and Hong Kong International Financial Centres on behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government with Shanghai to promote collaborative development, with a view to furtherforming a ""dual hub"" landscape of the two financial centres of Shanghai and Hong Kong, for better promotion of the internationalisation of RMB, thus contributing to a joint effort to building the country into a financial powerhouse. The Action Plan covers a number of measures, including supporting the Shanghai Clearing House (SHCH) to strengthen co-operation with Hong Kong banks and offshore Chinese banks in Hong Kong, supporting Mainland banks and financial institutions headquartered in Shanghai to set up regional headquarters in Hong Kong, and pressing ahead with the linkage of the Faster Payment System in Hong Kong with the Internet Banking Payment System on the Mainland.

During his stay in Shanghai, Mr Hui also visited several financial institutions, including the Shanghai Gold Exchange, the SHCH, and the Shanghai Futures Exchange, and met with Deputy Chief Executive of the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Mr Wang Huabin, and the President of Bank of Communications, Mr Zhang Baojiang, to discuss and exchange views to explore opportunities and models for co-operation regarding matters such as promoting gold market development in Hong Kong, enhancement to the offerings of the offshore RMB centre, and fostering collaborative development with the Mainland in financial derivatives and futures markets.

Mr Hui will return to Hong Kong this afternoon."

金管局回應美聯儲議息決定,2025-06-19 12:20,2025-06-19 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900319.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）聯邦公開市場委員會經過一連兩天的會議後，在香港時間今日（六月十九日）清晨公布維持聯邦基金利率目標區間於4.25-4.5厘。

美聯儲維持息率不變的決定符合市場預期。今次會後發表的點陣圖顯示，美聯儲有可能於今年內減息共50基點。然而，市場普遍認為美聯儲未來的減息步伐仍然存在較大的不確定性，視乎美國通脹和就業數據的走勢，以及關稅措施和其他經濟政策對經濟活動的影響。

香港方面，貨幣及金融市場保持有序運作。港元匯率在五月初走強並觸發聯繋匯率制度下的「強方兌換保證」，金管局按照聯匯制度從市場買入美元、沽出港元。銀行體系總結餘因此相應上升，使拆息回落。港美息差擴闊引發套息交易，令港元在過去數周逐步走近「弱方兌換保證」的7.85水平。港元市場和拆息往後的走向存在較多的變數，特別是套息交易、港元資金供求如資本市場活動及其他季節性因素等都對其有所影響。倘若套息交易持續，可能會令港元匯率進一步走弱，甚至可能觸發「弱方兌換保證」，屆時金管局將按照聯匯制度買入港元沽出美元，銀行體系總結餘將相應下降，而港元拆息將會逐步回升。

美國未來減息的幅度和步伐存在頗大的不確定性，而香港目前的利率環境因為上述各種變數而可能出現變化，市民在作出置業、投資或借貸決定時，需充分考慮港元息率可能回升的可能性，並管理相關風險。金管局會繼續密切監察市場變化，維持貨幣及金融穩定。"
HKMA's Response to US Fed's Interest Rate Decision,2025-06-19 12:20,2025-06-19 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900315.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Federal Open Market Committee of the United States Federal Reserve (the Fed) announced early today (June 19, Hong Kong time) after its two-day meeting that it had decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25-4.5 per cent.

The policy decision is in line with market expectations. The ""dot plot"" released following the meeting indicated that the Fed might cut rates by a total of 50 basis points before year end. However, the market generally considers that the pace of future rate cuts remains quite uncertain as it is dependent on US inflation and labour market data developments, as well as the impact of tariff and other economic policies on economic activities.

In Hong Kong, the monetary and financial markets have continued to operate in an orderly manner. The Hong Kong dollar strengthened in early May and triggered the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking under the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS). The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) sold Hong Kong dollars to the market in exchange for US dollars in accordance with the LERS. As a result, the Aggregate Balance increased, and thus bringing down interbank interest rates. The interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar widened, incentivising carry trades, leading to the easing of the Hong Kong dollar towards the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking level of 7.85 over the past few weeks. Going forward, the outlook for the Hong Kong dollar market and for interbank rates remains uncertain due to various factors, including carry trades, the supply-demand conditions for Hong Kong dollars created by capital market activities, as well as other seasonal factors. If carry trades are to persist, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate may weaken further, and may even trigger the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking. In such a case, the HKMA would then sell US dollars in exchange for Hong Kong dollars in accordance with the LERS, leading to a corresponding decline in the Aggregate Balance, hence driving Hong Kong dollar interbank rates to gradually increase.

The extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty, and the prevailing interest rate environment in Hong Kong may evolve due to the various factors mentioned above. The public should take into account the possibility of a rebound in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, and to properly manage the associated risks when making decisions about property purchase, investment or borrowing. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor market developments and maintain monetary and financial stability."
香港高等教育體系表現卓越　彰顯政府措施成效,2025-06-19 11:40,2025-06-19 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900297.htm,"教育局發言人今日（六月十九日）表示，在政府全力推動教育樞紐建設及一系列政策措施支持下，香港高等教育體系表現優異，根據國際高等教育機構Quacquarelli Symonds（QS）公布的二○二六年世界大學排名，大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學繼續位列頂尖，共有五所大學躋身世界百強，比例為全球最高（56%），成績令人鼓舞，這是對高等院校團隊努力不懈、持續追求卓越的肯定，也印證政府長期致力投資教育，提升高等院校競爭力的成果。

根據最新QS世界大學排名，香港大學躍升六位至全球第11名，香港中文大學上升四位至第32名，而香港科技大學上升三位至第44名。香港理工大學和香港城市大學同樣取得佳績，分別位列第54名和第63名。

香港在多項關鍵指標均見卓越表現，香港院校在「國際教職員比例」和「國際學生比例」方面表現遠勝國際平均水平，六所大學的「國際教職員比例」位列全球首50位。此外，香港院校在「教職員論文引用率」方面表現非常突出，香港城市大學在這項指標位居全球第二。

事實上，香港教育體系在多項國際排名取得優異成績，充分反映香港作為國際人才樞紐的吸引力。國際管理發展學院近日發布《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港在教育領域排名全球第二。此外，昨日（六月十八日）公布的二○二五年度泰晤士高等教育世界大學影響力排名評估全球各大學在實現聯合國17個可持續發展目標的表現，香港多間大學在不同範疇取得佳績，其中嶺南大學更首次在「優質教育」分項排行全球第一，成績斐然。

發言人說：「這些成就充分肯定政府全力透過教資會支持院校不斷革新優化，發揮一流大學優勢，並配合院校擴容提質，推行一系列政策招攬全球優秀人才的成效。對有意到香港高等院校求學或進行研究的海外專才，我們將盡最大努力提供協助便利，包括因應實際需要爭取更多非本地生名額。政府並會持續推動八所教資會資助大學的國際化及多元化發展，不僅增強香港的發展動能，更為國家建設作出積極貢獻。」

發言人強調，政府通過多項措施，包括獎學金計劃等，全方位吸引各地優秀人才和培育本地人才，以香港所長貢獻國家所需。由二○二四／二五學年起，教資會資助大學錄取非本地學生限額由20%提升一倍至40%，使非本地本科生收生人數比例從二○二三／二四學年的19.9%上升至23.2%。政府將進一步促進八所教資會資助大學協同合作，包括支持院校共同成立的大學校長會國際化小組繼續在全球推廣「留學香港」品牌。

發言人補充，政府亦會繼續致力促進本地大學研究人員與團隊加強國際交流及聯繫，推動他們拓展與海外同儕的研究網絡合作空間。

政府十分重視大學教與學的質素，投放大量資源推動香港教育更高質量發展。政府在二○二五至二○二八的三年期內向教資會資助大學提供的整體補助金，其中約78%均用於支援教學用途，而教資會為教與學所設的教學發展及語文培訓補助金亦增至約9.2億元，較二○二二至二○二五的三年期增加1億元。補助金的核心主題與時並進，配合教與學最新的發展趨勢及社會需求，包括在教育中融合生成式人工智能和創新技術，分享教與學的卓越實踐，以及加強學生的福祉與個人成長。教資會轄下質素保證局最新的質素核證結果亦再次肯定教資會資助大學為學生提供的高質素教育體驗。

為配合國家「十四五」規劃，政府會充分把握在粵港澳大灣區發展帶來的龐大機遇，透過教資會轄下研究資助局（研資局）支持八所大學教資會資助大學進行各類型尖端研究計劃。研資局設有20多個研究基金和獎學金計劃，每年資助超過1 500個新項目。這些措施均有助營造更蓬勃的科研環境，進一步鞏固香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位。"
立法會：署理商務及經濟發展局局長就「提振本地消費市場，為經濟注入發展動力」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-06-19 11:31,2025-06-19 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900301.htm,"以下是署理商務及經濟發展局局長陳百里博士今日（六月十九日）在立法會會議上，就「提振本地消費市場，為經濟注入發展動力」議員議案的開場發言：

主席：

我感謝何敬康議員提出這項動議，讓政府有機會聆聽各位議員對提振本地消費市場的想法和建議。對於何議員的動議，政府十分認同。

《提振消費專項行動方案》涵蓋八方面30項重點任務，帶出的重點是要刺激本地消費。消費，既與宏觀經濟息息相關，是經濟增長的重要引擎；又與千家萬戶緊密相連，是人民追求美好生活的最終體現。我們必須一方面發掘新的消費增長領域，在消費產品和服務供給方面提質擴容，促進潛在需求轉化為實際的消費行動；另一方面持續強化市民在生育、教育、就業、醫療養老等領域的社會保障和支援，消除影響消費決定的障礙，讓市民可以安心樂意消費。

順應經濟轉型抓緊發展機遇

在現今複雜多變的經濟環境下，政府深切明白企業在發展業務的過程中無可避免會面臨巨大挑戰。在維持固有優勢的同時，我們需要在本質上反思和改革，尋找新的發展方向，才能化挑戰為機遇。特區政府致力提供可靠和便利的營商環境和支援，並且透過促進盛事經濟和銀髮經濟等，讓業界和企業把握經濟轉型帶來的機遇，引領它們推出不同的措施吸引不同層面的消費者，當中尤其包括非本地旅客和銀髮一族消費者。

我很高興香港零售管理協會在本月初舉行的年度香港零售高峰會，以「破局求變」為主題，呼籲業界擁抱市場變化，積極探討近期政府政策為香港零售業開啓的新商機與潛力，例如盛事經濟、銀髮經濟，以及內地來港人才帶來的新機遇，靈活調整業務策略，實現真正效益。商務及經濟發展局局長在高峰會致辭，並留意到主辦機構在專題討論環節，邀請了各行業的專家領袖和成功企業分析最新的市場發展趨勢，以及分享企業如何有效善用這些機遇，制定切實可行的策略或轉變其商業模式，以滿足消費者需求並拓展業務。我欣悉零售業界「破局求變」的實際行動。

旅遊亦是香港經濟的重要一環。除旅遊業本身外，亦可以拉動酒店、餐飲、零售、交通等行業。香港素有盛事之都的美譽，今年三月啟德體育園的啓用更成為多項大型體育和娛樂盛事的新據點，為進一步推動盛事經濟創造條件。

除了盛事，香港每年均舉辦多場大型國際會議和展覽（會展）活動，涵蓋不同行業／主題包括電子、珠寶、禮品、鐘錶、燈飾等。這些會展活動不僅吸引本地消費者，亦帶來高消費商務旅客，令酒店、餐飲、零售、娛樂等多個行業受益，為香港經濟帶來重大貢獻。在二○二五年，香港兩個大型會展專用場地（即香港會議展覽中心和亞洲國際博覽館）預計合共舉辦超過140場會議和180場展覽，包括香港書展、世界航線發展大會2025、香港國際時尚匯展等大型國際會展活動。這些活動推動香港會展業發展，為商務旅客提供了一個高效的交流平台。香港貿易發展局將於八月主辦的美食博覽、家電‧家居‧博覽、香港國際茶展等展覽，亦會展示香港的多樣化產品，吸引大量市民和旅客的關注，進一步推動消費市場的活躍。

盛事和會展活動以外，政府亦主張業界和企業要充分了解不同年齡層的消費者亦有不同的需要和喜好，才可令他們更有意欲消費。香港高齡人口不斷增長，形成龐大的消費潛力。行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》提出成立促進銀髮經濟工作組，循五個範疇制定發展方案。工作組於今年五月落實推出30項措施，其中11項是促進「銀色消費」的措施。我們希望從五大方向，包括展覽及零售優惠、電子商貿、推廣銀髮友善飲食、銀髮高峰會及保障年長消費者權益等方式，多方面助力業界開拓銀髮市場，拉動銀髮族的消費。

聚焦提升消費能力和信心

在協助企業過渡經濟轉型和把握發展機遇之餘，提升居民消費能力和信心是提振消費的根本。因此，特區政府亦重視協助市民增加收入、減輕負擔和加強公共服務保障。

首先，就業是民生之本，除可為市民帶來收入，改善生活，亦可推動消費，促進經濟發展。政府致力提供適切的就業支援及培訓服務，協助本地勞工就業及持續就業，釋放勞動力，同時維持勞動人口的消費力。

就業以外，加強醫療和教育等生活保障除了能夠提高市民生活品質，亦是增強市民的消費意願不可或缺的重要一環。各相關決策局將繼續努力，增加市民的獲得感和幸福感，我亦會仔細聆聽議員的意見，把意見帶回相關決策局，並在總結發言時作出回應。

結語

主席，本港零售業和餐飲業近年因市民及旅客消費模式的轉變而有不同程度的影響是不爭的事實。不過，從整體數據方面，相關行業的表現開始呈回穩跡象。零售業方面，總銷貨價值的按年跌幅持續收窄，四月僅輕微下跌2.3%，以今年首四個月計每月平均總銷貨價值約309億元。餐飲業方面，食肆總收益價值在今年第一季按年僅微跌0.6%，季內每月平均值約93億元。我們有信心，政府透過繼續提倡盛事經濟和銀髮經濟等不同的政策，可讓業界和企業把握經濟轉型帶來的機遇，吸引更多旅客和本地市民的消費，從而進一步為本地經濟發展提供支持。

主席，今日在席的政府同事亦包括文化體育及旅遊局副局長和勞工及福利局副局長，我們會仔細聆聽各位議員對議案的意見，稍後在總結發言時再作詳細回應。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"

其後，羅淑佩拜訪上海市體育局局長徐彬，並進行工作午餐，分享香港推動體育發展的工作進展和成果。徐彬局長表示，文化、體育及旅遊發展空間很大，而體育切磋是兩地交流的橋樑，也可以促進經濟的拉動和社會的發展。羅淑佩說，近年中國香港運動員在國際賽事上的成績斐然，提升了市民對體育的關心和運動員的支持；而香港特區政府正密鑼緊鼓籌備今年十一月及十二月與廣東及澳門三地共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，希望透過今次交流，汲取上海曾經舉辦相同活動的經驗，進一步完善籌備工作。

下午，羅淑佩參觀中國共產黨第一次全國代表大會紀念館（中共一大紀念館），並與中共一大紀念館黨委書記、館長薛峰會面。中共一大紀念館是中國共產黨第一次全國代表大會會址，在一九二一年宣告了中國共產黨的誕生，意義非凡且重大。羅淑佩表示，香港特區政府也正在籌備一個介紹國家發展和成就的博物館，以及有關抗戰勝利八十周年的展覽，此行特意取經，為未來相關項目作更好的準備。

羅淑佩傍晚出席「2025上海西九文化周」開幕典禮及晚宴。她致辭時表示，香港和上海可謂血脈相連、氣質相通，皆是中西文化交融的典範、耀眼的東方明珠。兩地在經濟、文化與全球化的進程中，積極深化國際交往合作，共同為中華民族的偉大復興做好排頭兵的角色。

羅淑佩又指出：「西九文化區管理局今天啓動『上海西九文化周』，是第一次把一系列展覽、表演藝術節目、文化交流活動帶到香港以外。這不但是落實特區政府推動香港頂尖文化藝術創意項目『走出去』的重要里程碑，向外展示香港的多元藝術成就，更能夠吸引海內外朋友到訪香港，親身體驗我們的活力和魅力。」

「2025上海西九文化周」的特別支持機構包括上海市文化和旅遊局、上海市人民政府港澳事務辦公室、香港特區政府文化體育及旅遊局，以及香港特區政府駐上海經濟貿易辦事處。

SCST visits Shanghai (with photos),2025-06-18 21:22,2025-06-18 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800240.htm," The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, visited Shanghai today (June 18). In the morning, she went to the Shanghai Museum on People's Square and was given a guided tour of a well-received exhibition, ""On Top of the Pyramid: The Civilization of Ancient Egypt"". During her visit, Miss Law met with Deputy Director of the Shanghai Museum Mr Huang He. She thanked the Shanghai Museum for its support of Hong Kong over the years, while Mr Huang shared experiences in developing and designing creative products. Miss Law said Hong Kong could learn a lot from the Shanghai Museum in developing cultural and creative industries. Miss Law expressed hope that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) and the Shanghai Museum will strengthen their cultural co-operation in the future, contributing cultural content to the country's modernisation and promoting cultural prosperity.

 After that, Miss Law called on the Director of the Shanghai Administration of Sports, Mr Xu Bin, and had a working lunch together, during which she shared with him Hong Kong's progress and achievements in promoting sports development. Mr Xu said there is huge room for developing culture, sports and tourism, while sports exchanges serve as a bridge between the two places and can also boost economic and social developments. Miss Law said that Hong Kong, China athletes achieved excellent results in international competitions in recent years, which helps lift citizens' interests in sports and support for athletes. Miss Law added that Hong Kong is preparing at full steam for the 15th National Games and the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games to be cohosted with Guangdong and Macao this November and December. Through today's exchange, Miss Law said she hopes to learn from Shanghai's experiences in hosting same events and further improve the preparatory work.

 In the afternoon, Miss Law visited the Memorial Hall of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China and met with the Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of the Memorial, Mr Xue Feng. The Memorial is the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held in 1921, in which the founding of the CPC was announced, bearing great significance. Noting that the HKSARG is setting up a museum to introduce the country's developments and achievements and preparing exhibitions related to the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Miss Law said the visit was arranged intentionally to seek guidance, with an aim to make better preparations for the relevant projects in the future.

 In the evening, Miss Law attended the opening ceremony and dinner of WestK Shanghai Week 2025. Speaking at the event, she said that Hong Kong and Shanghai are connected by blood and share common traits, as they are both exemplars of the fusion of Eastern and Western cultures and dazzling Pearls of the Orient. The two places actively deepen international exchanges and co-operations in areas of economy, culture and globalisation, serving as pioneers in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

 Miss Law also said, ""The West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD) is an important cultural infrastructure investment of the HKSARG. After many years of development, the WKCD has transformed from a blueprint into reality today and become one of the largest cultural hubs in the world, featuring performing arts venues with our country's staunch support. The Hong Kong Palace Museum, which opened in 2022, and the M+ museum, which commenced operation in 2021, have become world-class museums blending traditional and contemporary arts and cultures.""

 ""The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA) kick-started WestK Shanghai Week today. It is the first time a series of exhibitions and performing arts programmes and cultural exchange activities have been brought outside Hong Kong. It is not only an important milestone of the HKSARG driving top-notch arts, cultural and creative programmes to go global, but also showcases Hong Kong's diverse arts achievements and further attracts local and overseas visitors to experience Hong Kong's vibrancy and appeal firsthand,"" Miss Law added.

 Supporting organisations of WestK Shanghai Week 2025 include the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau of the HKSARG, and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai of the HKSARG.

 This morning, Miss Law visited the ""WestK x MANNER"" limited-edition art collaboration themed store, jointly rolled out by the WKCDA and Shanghai's beloved coffee brand MANNER COFFEE. The store invited Hong Kong's renowned illustrator Don Mak to craft exclusive designs inspired by the Victoria Harbour skyline, WKCD panoramas and iconic Hong Kong urban motifs, demonstrating the creative charm of integrating culture, creative industry and tourism.

 Upon arrival yesterday (June 17), Miss Law had a working lunch with representatives of the management of Shanghai Shendi Group to exchange information on the latest tourism situation in Shanghai and Hong Kong. She also visited the Shanghai Disney Resort to learn about its operation and development. Miss Law said that the Shanghai Disney Resort and the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort are iconic attractions in the two places, which play vital roles in driving regional tourism and economic development.

 Miss Law will depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong tonight."
Government's response to temporary stay granted by Court about decision to remove Aggressive Construction Company Limited from register,2025-06-18 20:45,2025-06-18 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800801.htm,"In response to the grant by the Court of First Instance of the High Court today (June 18) of an interim-interim stay of execution of the Building Authority's (BA) decision to remove the Aggressive Construction Company Limited (ACCL) from the register of general building contractors, the Development Bureau (DEVB) said that to consider further steps, the Buildings Department (BD), in its capacity as the BA, would study the written judgment to be handed down by the Court shortly together with its legal team. Meanwhile, the BD will prepare for the appeal hearing with full effort.

The BA refused the registration renewal application of ACCL on May 22, 2025 and decided to remove its name from the register of general building contractors on June 20. ACCL has appealed against the decision and applied for a stay of execution of the decision. The Court of First Instance of the High Court today granted an interim-interim stay of execution of the decision. The hearing of the appeal and application for stay of execution is tentatively scheduled for August 26 and 27.

The spokesman for the DEVB said, ""As the Court has granted an interim-interim stay of execution of the decision, ACCL will not be removed from the register of general building contractors on June 20. During the period pending further hearings, if there are still construction activities on the project sites undertaken by ACCL, the project owners concerned will act in accordance with the contracts and continue to monitor the construction sites and the performance of the contractor. If the contractor's performance fails to meet the contractual requirements, the project owners will handle the matter in accordance with the contract and reserve the right to take follow-up actions. The BD and project owners will also step up monitoring and surprise inspections to safeguard site safety. In fact, since the performance of ACCL in respect of the public works project of the Chai Wan Government Complex was far below the contractual requirements, the Government as the project owner has terminated the contract in accordance with the contractual mechanism and taken over the construction site on June 15. The Government will endeavour to arrange in the near term for a new contractor to take over and finish the remaining works."""

尊敬的解冬副市長（上海市副市長）、唐英年主席（西九文化區管理局董事局主席）、鍾曉敏局長（上海市文化和旅遊局局長）、各位來賓、各位朋友：

大家晚上好。我很榮幸今日來到上海，和各位一起為「2025上海西九文化周」主持開幕。

兩年前，我以運輸署署長的身分到訪上海，參觀上海的新能源汽車發展和智慧交通管理，獲益良多；這次再到上海，崗位已經改變，考察的內容完全不同，這一次讓我能聚焦學習我非常感興趣的文化藝術領域，格外的興奮。

香港跟上海可謂血脈相連、氣質相通，都是東西文化交融的典範。兩座城市都是國家重要的國際樞紐，都是耀眼的東方明珠，在中外人文交流中扮演橋樑的角色。儘管當前世界地緣政治複雜多變，我們兩個城市依然在經濟、文化與全球化的進程中，積極深化國際交流合作，一同為中華民族的偉大復興做好「排頭兵」的角色。

國家《十四五規劃綱要》明確支持香港發展成為中外文化藝術交流中心。為實現國家賦予香港的重要定位，香港特區政府去年公布了《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為實現香港未來的文化藝術和創意產業發展訂下清晰的願景和發展的方向，當中西九文化區管理局是我們的其中最重要的策略夥伴，發揮不可或缺的作用。

西九文化區是香港特別行政區政府最重要的文化基建投資。經過多年的發展，今日的西九文化區已經從藍圖變為現實，成為全球最具規模的文化樞紐之一，擁有表演藝術場地、得到國家大力支持，在二○二二年開館的香港故宮文化博物館，和二○二一年開始投入運作的M+，都是世界級博物館，糅合傳統與當代文化藝術。每年，西九文化區傾力呈獻最優秀的文化藝術節目，不但廣受香港市民的歡迎，更已經成為訪港遊客必訪的文化旅遊目的地，推動文旅融合。

為響應香港特區行政長官李家超在去年《施政報告》提出的政策，西九文化區管理局領頭建設香港文藝創意產業鏈，加強文化藝術創意項目產出，管理局今天啓動的「2025上海西九文化周」，是第一次把一系列展覽、表演藝術節目、文化交流活動帶到香港以外。這不但是落實特區政府推動香港頂尖文化藝術創意項目「走出去」的重要里程碑，向外展示香港的多元藝術成就，更能夠吸引海內外朋友到訪香港，親身體驗我們的活力和魅力。

事實上，香港跟上海的文化合作真是多不勝數。過去兩年，香港主要和中小型藝團在上海演出了接近30場音樂、話劇、舞蹈表演。文化交流有來有往，我們現在正熱切期待上海的朋友在今年八月的中華文化節把傳統江南絲竹音樂帶給香港的觀眾。再加上今日這個前所未有的滬港文化盛宴，我相信我們將進一步激發兩地的文化連結，促進藝文界的創新對話與合作，共同努力建立五光十色、百花齊放、多彩多姿的文化氛圍。

剛才我提到西九文化區在文旅融合的角色。特區政府在其他範疇也會繼續秉承國家「以文塑旅、以旅彰文」的方向，發展和豐富自身的香港文化內涵，豐富旅客的旅遊體驗，落實貫徹中央國務院港澳事務辦公室夏寶龍主任指導的「香港無處不旅遊」理念。我知道上海同胞特別熱愛旅遊，我歡迎你們多來香港走走逛逛、吃吃香港點心，還有剛才提到的菠蘿包、乾炒牛河，看看大熊貓。我們香港上下發揮熱情好客的精神，一定會讓大家樂而忘返，念念不忘，一來再來。

最後，我代表特區政府，向上海市人民政府對「2025上海西九文化周」的大力支持致以最衷心的感謝。我也感謝西九文化區管理局主辦和所有台前幕後工作人員，為這一次盛會的成功舉辦付出的心力、努力。

我祝願「2025上海西九文化周」圓滿成功，讓滬港兩地文化交流譜寫新篇章。謝謝各位。"
CHP investigates confirmed Mpox case,2025-06-18 19:57,2025-06-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800768.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (June 18) that it is investigating a confirmed Mpox (also known as Monkeypox) case, and urged the public to be vigilant and avoid close physical contact with persons suspected of contracting Mpox. Meanwhile, high-risk target groups are advised to receive Mpox vaccinations.

The case involves a 20-year-old male. He developed skin ulcer and swollen lymph nodes on June 10 and attended the Yau Ma Tei Male Social Hygiene Clinic of the DH on June 16. He is in stable condition and is being isolated at Princess Margaret Hospital.

  An initial investigation revealed that he had not received Mpox vaccination. He had a history of high-risk exposure in Hong Kong during the incubation period, but no epidemiological linkages have been established between this case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong. The CHP is continuing its epidemiological investigations of the case and will report it to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The WHO held a special meeting on Mpox early this month and confirmed that Mpox remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The WHO continued to appeal to member statesto enhance surveillance and prevention and control measures forMpox, in order to reduce the spread of Mpox.Hong Kong has put in place the Preparedness and Response Plan for Mpox (the Plan) since June 2022 and activated the alert response level under the Plan after the first confirmed case of Mpox in September of the same year. The CHP has implemented a series of measures (including enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, public education and vaccination) which have been effective in preventing local outbreaks of Mpox in the past three years.

Since 2022, a total of 76 Mpox cases (62 local and 14 imported) have been recorded in Hong Kong, of which eight cases were recorded this year. All patients were male. Epidemiological investigations revealed that most cases had history of high-risk sexual behaviours, including having sex with strangers or without wearing condoms when having sex. Hong Kong has not yet detected any new Mpox strain (Clade Ib) cases.

The CHP reminded high-risk target groups to receive Mpox vaccinations in order to lower the risk of infection or the possibility of having more severe symptoms after infection. In addition, persons who experience Mpox symptoms (including rashes, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion, muscle pain, and severe headaches) or suspect themselves of being infected are advised to seek medical attention and receive treatment at once. They should not engage in activities with others that may expose others to their skin rash or body fluids. Members of the public should maintain good personal and hand hygiene to prevent virus transmission or infection through contact. They should also avoid close physical contact with persons or animals suspected of being infected.

The CHP has set up an Mpox telephone hotline (2125 2373), which operates from Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm, excluding public holidays. Those who suspect or are concerned that they may have had high-risk contact with confirmed cases, particularly men who have sex with men or those who have sexual practices with strangers, can use the hotline to make enquiries and receive relevant health advice.

Furthermore, the DH provides vaccination services to high-risk groups of Mpox. The following high-risk target groups are eligible for Mpox vaccinations on a voluntary basis:


individuals with high-risk sexual practices, e.g. having multiple sexual partners, sex workers, or having a history of sexually transmitted infection within the past 12 months;
healthcare workersresponsible forcaring forpatients with confirmed Mpox;
laboratory personnel working with zoonotic pox viruses; and
animal care personnel with high risk of exposure in case of Mpox occurrences in animals in Hong Kong.


The high-risk target groups can receive Mpox walk-in vaccinations at any of the DH's Social Hygiene Service Clinics (SocHS) (namely Chai Wan SocHS, Wan Chai Male SocHS, Wan Chai Female SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Male SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Female SocHS, Yung Fung Shee SocHS, Fanling SocHS and Tuen Mun SocHS) and the DH's Yau Ma Tei Integrated Treatment Centre.

Meanwhile, the DH's Kowloon Bay Integrated Treatment Centre and the Hospital Authority's Special Medical Clinics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital also provide Mpox vaccination services for their clients.

政府回應法庭暫緩將精進建築除名的決定,2025-06-18 19:43,2025-06-18 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800754.htm,"就高等法院原訟法庭今日（六月十八日）暫時批准精進建築有限公司（「精進建築」）申請暫緩執行建築事務監督將其從「一般建築承建商名冊」除名的決定，發展局表示屋宇署作為建築事務監督會與法律團隊研究法庭稍後頒下的書面判決，以考慮進一步行動。與此同時，署方會全力準備上訴聆訊。

建築事務監督於二○二五年五月二十二日拒絕「精進建築」的註冊續期申請，並決定於六月二十日將其從「一般建築承建商名冊」中除名。「精進建築」日前就上述決定提出上訴並申請暫緩執行決定。高等法院原訟法庭今日暫時批准暫緩執行決定的申請。上訴及暫緩執行決定申請聆訊暫定於八月二十六及二十七日進行。

發展局發言人表示：「由於法庭暫時批准暫緩執行除名的決定，因此『精進建築』不會在六月二十日從『一般建築承建商名冊』除名。在等候進一步聆訊期間，如『精進建築』承辦的發展項目地盤仍有建築活動，相關項目擁有人會根據合約行事，繼續監督建築地盤和承建商的表現。如承建商的表現不符合合約要求，項目擁有人會按合約處理，並保留跟進權利。屋宇署和項目擁有人亦會加強監察和突擊巡查，保障地盤工地安全。事實上，由於『精進建築』在柴灣政府大樓工務工程的表現遠低於合約要求，政府作為項目擁有人已按合約機制終止合約，於六月十五日收回該建築地盤，並爭取短期內安排新承建商接手完成餘下工程。」"
立法會：創新科技及工業局副局長就「以新質生產力激發香港中小型企業蓬勃發展，積極對接國家高質量『出海』戰略」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-06-18 19:39,2025-06-18 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800752.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局副局長張曼莉今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上，就「以新質生產力激發香港中小型企業蓬勃發展，積極對接國家高質量『出海』戰略」議員議案的總結發言：

代主席：

感謝提出議案的陳祖恒議員，亦感謝提出修正案的嚴剛議員及29位議員提供寶貴的意見。就議員提到幾個與創新科技（創科）相關方面，包括發展新質生產力、推動企業採用科技升級轉型，善用香港檢測認證等專業服務及生產性服務業的能力，助力我們的企業「出海」，以及吸引更多優秀科技企業落戶香港及幫助他們利用香港獨特的優勢拓展海外市場，我希望在此作重點回應。

我們認同不少議員提及加快發展新質生產力，推動企業（包括中小企業）結合科技升級轉型的重要性。為此，特區政府撥款五億元予數碼港，在去年推出「數碼轉型支援先導計劃」，協助涵蓋餐飲、零售、旅遊及個人服務業的中小企更好應用數碼科技。計劃目前已批出逾5 400宗申請。有獲資助的零售店表示，計劃能幫助他們提升營運效率、擴展顧客群，生意額也有所增長。此外，正如吳永嘉議員有提到，在推動新質生產力的路上，工業亦都要加速轉型。我們去年優化了「新型工業化資助計劃」，積極鼓勵本港傳統製造業利用創科升級轉型，轉向智能製造。政府亦將在今年內推出「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」，以配對形式向每家在港營運生產線的企業提供最多25萬元的資助，協助他們為現有生產線引進先進技術。而這些不論是數碼轉型、技術及生產力的提升，其實也是企業蓬勃發展及「走出去」的基礎和本錢。

另一方面，正如李慧琼議員及陳紹雄議員等也有提到，香港的檢測和認證業信譽昭著，亦都是我們助力企業「出海」的一張皇牌。憑着業界專業、高效靈活的服務和「香港檢測‧香港認證」的品牌，可有效協助企業提升其產品的品質和安全；加上香港擁有完善的知識產權保護制度及成熟的國際網絡，結合起來能讓企業更好地對外展示其產品的質量，從而協助企業「走出去」。政府會繼續支持香港檢測和認證局，進一步提高香港檢測和認證服務的專業水平，致力提升業界發出檢測認證結果的國際認受性，從而更好地配合國家高質量「出海」的發展策略。

另一方面，有不少議員也提及，香港要積極引進海內外優秀的創科企業落戶，以及希望協助這些落戶企業連同本地的企業利用香港獨特的優勢「併船出海」。我在這裏向各位議員匯報，截至今年四月，我們已經與超過200家來自海內外有潛力或具代表性之創科企業洽談好於香港落戶或擴展業務，當中更有不少引進的創科企業除了已拓展業務外，亦已申請或已成功在香港交易所上市。此外，我們的創科公營機構，包括大家熟悉的香港科技園公司（科技園公司）、數碼港及香港生產力促進局（生產力局）亦會繼續大力支持創科企業開拓不同市場。例如：科技園公司及數碼港現正積極拓展海外市場的合作夥伴網絡，為其園區創科企業、我們本地不同的創科中小企、初創可以提供更好的支援，以協助他們有更好的網絡，更高效地進軍國際市場，並橋接海內外資金。

另外，亦有很多議員提到「出海」的服務。在這方面，我們的生產力局亦率先佈局，成立「出海服務中心」The Cradle，既推廣本港的先進技術的方案及產品，亦為企業「出海」提供一站式涵蓋產品開發、ESG及檢測服務、海外市場推廣、國際化技術標準對接、知識產權管理、乃至海外法規等一站式技術支援、對接及專業服務，助力企業「併船出海」。當然，很多議員提到除了「出海」，我們亦積極透過不同佈局，支援我們的企業同時間拓展大灣區以至內地龐大市場的發展機遇。

代主席、各位議員，我們會繼續與各持份者緊密合作，聆聽議會及業界意見，積極支持以新質生產力激發香港的創科及中小企業蓬勃發展，充分利用香港的優勢，對接國家高質量「出海」戰略，為香港、為國家貢獻高質量發展。本人謹此陳辭。"
衞生防護中心調查一宗猴痘確診個案,2025-06-18 19:20,2025-06-18 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800748.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（六月十八日）表示，正調查一宗猴痘確診個案，並提醒市民提高警覺，避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人士作密切身體接觸，同時強烈建議高風險目標群組人士接種猴痘疫苗。

個案涉及一名20歲男子。他於六月十日開始出現皮膚潰瘍和淋巴結腫大，六月十六日到衞生署油麻地男性社會衞生科診所求診。病人情況穩定，現於瑪嘉烈醫院進行隔離。

初步調查顯示，他沒有接種猴痘疫苗，於潛伏期內曾在香港有高風險接觸。沒有資料顯示此個案與本港早前錄得的其他猴痘確診個案有流行病學關連，中心會繼續就個案進行流行病學調查，並將個案通報世界衞生組織（世衞）。

世衞本月初就猴痘舉行了特別會議，確認猴痘疫情仍然是國際關注的突發公共衞生事件。世衞繼續呼籲成員國加強對猴痘的監測及防控措施，以減低猴痘疫情的蔓延。香港自二○二二年六月起已制定猴痘準備及應變計劃，並於同年九月出現首宗猴痘確診個案後，啓動該計劃下的戒備級別。中心實施的一系列措施（包括加強個䅁監測、接觸者追蹤、公眾教育和疫苗接種等）在過去三年有效防止猴痘在本地出現爆發。

自二○二二年起至今，本港共錄得76宗猴痘個案（62宗本地個案和14宗輸入個案），當中八宗於今年錄得，全部病人均為男性。流行病學調查顯示，絕大部分個案曾進行高風險性行為，包括與陌生人發生性行為或在沒有配戴安全套的情況下進行性行為。香港至今未有發現新型猴痘病毒株（分支Ib型）的個案。

中心提醒高風險目標群組人士應接種猴痘疫苗，以減低感染或感染後出現較嚴重病徵的機會。此外，出現猴痘症狀（包括皮疹、發燒、發冷、淋巴結腫大、疲乏、肌肉痛及劇烈頭痛等）或懷疑自己受感染的人士應立即求醫並接受治療，不應與其他人進行可能接觸到皮疹或體液的活動。市民亦應時刻保持良好個人及手部衞生，預防經接觸傳播或感染病毒，並避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人或動物作密切身體接觸。

中心設有猴痘電話熱線（2125 2373），逢星期一至五（公眾假期除外）上午九時至下午五時運作。任何人懷疑或憂慮曾與確診病人有高風險接觸，尤其是男男性接觸者或曾與陌生人發生性行為，可致電熱線查詢及獲取相關的健康建議。

此外，衞生署為高風險群組提供接種猴痘疫苗服務，以下高風險目標群組人士可以自願形式接種猴痘疫苗：


曾進行高風險性行為，例如擁有多名性伴侶、性工作者、過去十二個月有性傳播感染史；
負責照顧猴痘確診病人的醫護人員；
處理動物傳染痘病毒的實驗室人員；及
當本港動物出現猴痘個案時有較高暴露風險的照顧動物人員。


高風險目標群組人士可於衞生署轄下全部社會衞生科診所（柴灣社會衞生科診所、灣仔男性社會衞生科診所、灣仔女性社會衞生科診所、油麻地男性社會衞生科診所、油麻地女性社會衞生科診所、容鳳書社會衞生科診所、粉嶺社會衞生科診所和屯門社會衞生科診所）及衞生署油麻地綜合治療中心接種猴痘疫苗，無須預約。

衞生署九龍灣綜合治療中心，以及醫院管理局伊利沙伯醫院和瑪嘉烈醫院的特別內科診所亦會為到診者提供猴痘疫苗接種服務。

LCQ5: Measures to monitor condition of water mains,2025-06-18 19:10,2025-06-18 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800714.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Yung Hoi-yan and a reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

 The earlier fresh water quality incidents at Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court, as well as the water mains burst incident in Tuen Mun, have aroused public concern about the condition of water mains. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the staff establishment and work details of the working group established in connection with the water quality incidents at Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court, including the estimated number of times that the water tanks will be cleansed and the water quality will be tested, as well as the expenditures involved; whether the group will investigate if the incidents involved human negligence; of the total number of enquiries or requests for assistance from residents on water quality problems received by the offices of the two housing estates/housing courts so far;

(2) as the Water Supplies Department has indicated that it will replace all pipes in Hong Kong which are still coated with bitumen, of the distribution of the pipes concerned in various districts in Hong Kong at present, the names of the housing estates/housing courts involved, as well as the timetable for the relevant pipe replacement work; whether it has plans to inspect the fresh water supply systems of all housing estates/housing courts in Hong Kong to ascertain that they will not accumulate bitumen, resin or other impurities; if so, of the details (including the timetable, the manpower and the expenditure involved); if not, the reasons for that, and the measures in place to prevent similar incidents; and

(3) whether it has plans to enhance the application of technology and artificial intelligence to conduct 24-hour continuous monitoring and analysis of the conditions of water mains and water quality, so as to identify abnormalities in water mains at an early stage and carry out repairs; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 My reply to the questions raised by the Hon Yung Hoi-yan is as follows:

(1) The Government is highly concerned about the incident of bitumen sediments found in the fresh water at Queen's Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court. After receiving reports of black spots in the water at the end of May, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) and the Housing Department (HD) immediately formed a joint working group to conduct a joint investigation on the incident and formulate measures to resolve the issue. The working group is co-led by the Director of Water Supplies and the Deputy Director (Estate Management) of the HD, with members including 11 staff such as in-service engineers and property management professionals responsible for the operation of the water supply facilities and estate management in that area. The WSD has cleaned 11 times for the water mains under its management and maintenance, while the HD has conducted six and three times of cleaning of the water pipes and water tanks under its management respectively. The HD has also installed 22 screen filters at the water inlet of each building and the estates. The WSD continues to collect water samples from the estates for testing. So far, all samples have complied with the Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards.

 Since the establishment with promotion of the 24-hour hotline on June 7, the Government has received a total of about 700 enquiries. In addition, the WSD has received over 1 500 requests for flushing water meters through various channels, including street counters and home visits organised by the members of District Council, the three district committees and the Care Teams, and the WSD has completed the flushing of water meters within one to two days. Currently, most of the residents reported an improvement in water quality and follow-up action is not required.

 The WSD believes that the black sediments in the fresh water originated from a 400-metre-long steel water main at the upstream water supply network at Ping Che Road. This water main uses bitumen as an inner lining serving as a protective coating, and the sediment is likely residue that was flushed into the inside service of the estates before the installation of screen filters at the WSD's water mains by the end of 2022. We have set up an expert group consisting of the Chairman and two members of the Drinking Water Safety Advisory Committee (DWSAC) to assist with the traceability work. The expert group believes that the above assessment is reasonable. The WSD will submit an investigation report of the incident to the DWSAC for review in the near term.

 Learning from this experience, we should be able to make improvement in the aspects of the explanation process and handling time. We are now working at full steam on the various tasks and the expenditure involved is part of the expenditure of relevant departments in providing service, making it difficult to be separated out for the time being.

(2) Similar to Hong Kong, water mains with bitumen lining as protection still exist in the water supply systems of some advanced cities. The material is prone to peeling after prolonged use. The WSD has ceased applying bitumen lining on fresh water mains since 2005. At present, we have conducted further classification of water pipes that still contain this type of lining. Only about 230 km are fresh water distribution mains, representing roughly 3.9 per cent of Hong Kong's total fresh water distribution mains. The distribution of their locations is set out at Annex of the reply.

 While the bitumen used in water supplies facilities is inert and insoluble in water, any peeled tiny particles in the water supply can still cause worries among the public. To address this situation, the WSD has installed over 1 000 screen filters in the related water supply network taking into account the amount of peeling, complaint cases and population supplied with the water, etc. These filters effectively prevent peeling materials from entering the inside service of the buildings. The WSD is reviewing the necessity of installing additional screen filters at suitable locations, and revising the guidelines to advise property management companies on the methods to maintain water mains and screen filters.

 To expedite the decommissioning of the water mains with bitumen lining at Ping Che Road related to Queen's Hill incident, the WSD has explored to adopt an out-of-the-box approach over the past week by using exposed temporary water mains. They, together with the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the contractor, collaborate with the Transport Department, the Hong Kong Police Force and the North District Office on inter-departmental and collaborative basis to formulate traffic arrangements. Despite busy traffic conditions and narrow work space of the site, through collective efforts, the WSD will immediately commence the project and work around the clock to complete the temporary water mains by early July. In other words, this section of bitumen lining steel water mains will decommission from early July onwards. The WSD will also strive to replace the exposed temporary water mains with a permanent underground water mains by the end of this year.

 Last year, the WSD obtained funding approval from the Legislative Council for replacing or rehabilitating about 20 km (Note) of steel mains with bitumen lining on the inner wall. In response to this incident and ageing water mains burst, the WSD will submit short and medium term proposals for water mains replacement to the DEVB for review. We expect to discuss this at the meeting of the Panel on Development next month.

(3) The WSD will expand the monitoring area of Water Intelligent Network (WIN) to include fresh water trunk mains and all fresh water distribution mains. The sensors used for monitoring the water flow and pressure will also be upgraded to expedite the identification and repair of water mains with potential burst risk. The entire project is expected to be completed in 2027. We have asked the WSD to explore the possibility of early completion.

 The WSD will collaborate with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to set up the joint laboratory of ""In-line Robot"" this August to conduct high-precision inspections of water mains.

 As regards the monitoring of water quality, the WSD has installed 24-hour online water quality monitoring systems in some key reservoirs and water treatment works. In addition, the WSD randomly collects water samples from some 28 000 consumers' taps in Hong Kong for testing every year. The sampling ratio, testing methods, and parameters covered adhere to international standards. The WSD has also commenced a study since 2023 to construct more water quality monitoring points in the water supply network in the following few years to enhance the alert capability. The study is expected to be completed within this year.

 Thank you, President.

代主席：

我感謝陳祖恒議員提出的議案、嚴剛議員提出的修正案，以及其他29位議員提出的建議和想法。接下來，我會就議員提出的意見作綜合回應。

正如剛才很多位議員都提及當下環球市場出現東升西降的變化，特別是內地企業發展迅速而市場龐大，我們處於最有利的位置，能同時爭取北上和南下的商機。

在招商引資方面，今年首四個月內，投資推廣署共協助了223間內地和海外企業，較去年同期增長13%。我們會繼續聯同相關機構、商會及專業團體積極向內地及海外潛在投資者及企業推廣香港的獨特優勢和大灣區建設及「一帶一路」倡議等帶來的機遇，吸引更多企業落戶香港。

此外，香港貿易發展局（貿發局）在舉辦國際展覽會議和投資推廣活動時，會安排環球投資項目對接環節及商貿配對服務，提供香港設計、品牌管理、文化創意、授權等專業服務的對接機會，助力內地企業拓展海外市場。貿發局將於二○二五年在內地舉辦融資沙龍，吸引內地企業來港上市，並組織行業考察前往中東及東南亞國家聯盟，協助香港各界與內地企業併船出海。

在金融領域合作方面，我們會繼續把握香港在「一國兩制」下金融體系的獨特優勢和國家對大灣區金融開放創新的支持，透過各種措施開拓新市場及吸引新資金，例如香港交易及結算所有限公司和證券及期貨事務監察委員會剛於今年五月推出「科企專線」，向特專科技和生物科技公司在提交上市申請前提供專門指引；在過去一年，政府先後在北京、上海和寧波舉辦了投資香港推介大會上市專場，向內地企業介紹香港上市的程序和便利措施；香港會計師公會也整合了一份涵蓋超過80家專門助力內地企業出海的香港會計師事務所名單。

知識產權署會持續聯繫內地、地區和國際組織，推廣香港作為區域知識產權貿易中心的角色，並與貿發局及持份者合作，透過商貿考察團、研討會推廣知識產權貿易及專業服務，包括與貿發局舉辦年度的亞洲知識產權營商論壇。貿發局亦會增加商務配對活動和提供更多知識產權貿易的市場資訊，加強支援本地原創作品打入內地及國際市場。

同時，商經局亦繼續透過專業服務協進支援計劃，鼓勵合資格的團體及機構善用計劃資源，以促進本港專業服務的發展。至今，已有超過120個項目獲得主計劃資助，涵蓋多個專業範疇，從能力提升課程到國際交流活動，為業界創造更多機遇。這些項目有助鞏固香港作為國際專業服務樞紐的領先地位，進一步為本港的中小企業帶來商機。

因應內地市場的需求持續增長，特區政府會繼續把握CEPA（《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》）下內地給予香港的優惠措施，助力香港企業和專業人才為內地市場提供優質產品和服務。在服務貿易方面，大灣區市場在多個範疇以先行先試的方式對香港作更大程度開放，讓香港服務提供者在大灣區市場提供更多樣化的專業服務，推動大灣區服務貿易的發展。

為協助中小企業發展跨境電子商貿（電商）等新業態、新模式，除了我在開場發言時提到的「電商易」之外，我們亦透過貿發局推行「電子商務快綫」、舉辦第二屆「香港好物節」等，加強協助企業提升品牌曝光度，開拓境外電商市場。同時，我們會透過四個中小企服務中心加強向企業發放電商資訊，工業貿易署今年亦會推出營商導師計劃，加強支援中小企業發展品牌和拓展電商銷售的網絡。

結語

代主席，儘管全球貿易格局和地緣政治不斷變化，為香港經濟帶來不明朗因素，政府會積極鞏固香港作為國家南大門的地位，發揮內聯外通的獨特優勢，透過「立足本地、聯動灣區、拓展國際」的策略，加大力度深化國際交往合作，在複雜多變的全球貿易格局下，力求化危為機，善用我們聯通國家與世界雙向平台的重要角色，吸引更多內地和海外企業落戶香港發展，同時協助香港企業開拓內地市場的商機，以增強香港經濟的發展動能。

代主席，我謹此陳辭。"

  According to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615), the Regime came into effect on April 1, 2023. Any person who is seeking to carry on a business of dealing in precious metals and stones, and engage in any transaction(s) (whether making or receiving a payment) with a total value at or above HK$120,000 in Hong Kong is required to register with Hong Kong Customs and fulfil his/her anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing statutory obligations as appropriate. All dealers in precious metals and stones must successfully obtain a relevant registration before they can carry out any cash or non-cash transaction(s) with a total value at or above HK$120,000.

  For non-Hong Kong dealers fulfilling the prescribed conditions (including those who come to Hong Kong to participate in exhibitions), although they are exempt from registration, they are required to submit to Hong Kong Customs a cash transaction report for any cash transaction(s) (whether making or receiving a payment) with a total value at or above HK$120,000 carried out in Hong Kong within one day after the transaction, or before the dealer or the person acting on behalf of the dealer leaves Hong Kong, whichever is earlier.

  Non-Hong Kong dealers can make an online submission of a cash transaction report via the Regime's webpage at www.drs.customs.gov.hk by accessing the Dealers in Precious Metals and Stones Registration System. They can also download the related form at www.drs.customs.gov.hk/download/drsform/CED418_Form%208_Cash%20transaction%20report.pdf and then submit the report in person at Hong Kong Customs' booth at the JGA.

Customs officers intercepted two incoming male passengers, both aged 44, at Hong Kong International Airport on March 11. A total of about 57 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 68 200 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $440,000 and a duty potential of about $190,000 in total, were seized from their personal baggage. They were subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

立法會：勞工及福利局局長就《2025年僱傭（修訂）條例草案》恢復二讀辯論發言全文（只有中文）,2025-06-18 18:00,2025-06-18 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800662.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上就《2025年僱傭（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）恢復二讀辯論的發言全文：

主席：

《2025年僱傭（修訂）條例草案》今日得以恢復二讀辯論，我首先感謝法案委員會主席葉劉淑儀議員、副主席梁子穎議員、法案委員會其他委員，以及立法會秘書處的全力配合和支援，讓《條例草案》的審議工作順利完成。另外，我亦非常感謝今日共有16位議員發言，在剛才的二讀辯論中表達他們的意見。

《條例草案》修訂《僱傭條例》下「連續性合約」規定的工作時數，即大家統稱的工時門檻。現行規定，俗稱「4-18」，即僱員如連續受僱於同一僱主四星期或以上，而每星期工作18小時或以上，已沿用多年。基於勞動市場的變化，以及為了讓僱員更容易享有《僱傭條例》下全面的權益，政府於二○二二年啓動檢討有關規定。勞工顧問委員會（勞顧會）深入討論後，於二○二四年二月就檢討達成共識。按勞顧會達成的共識修訂「連續性合約」規定，是《行政長官2024年施政報告》公布的其中一項重要的勞工支援措施。

《條例草案》修訂《僱傭條例》附表一有關「連續性合約」規定的工時門檻，包括兩個主要元素：一、每星期的工時門檻由18小時降低至17小時；二、提供另一個以指定四星期工時合計為一個計算單位的方法，如僱員某星期的工時及緊接過去三星期的合計工時達68小時，則即使該星期的工時少於17小時，該星期亦會被計算在連續性僱傭合約內。

修訂後《僱傭條例》的其他條文會繼續應用，僱員現時獲取各項法定權益的資格仍然維持不變，現時已符合「連續性合約」規定的僱員亦不受影響。

這次修訂降低「連續性合約」規定的工時門檻，並在計算工時方面加入彈性，讓僱員更容易符合修訂後的「連續性合約」規定，同時減少僱員因偶爾在某星期工時低於門檻便中斷連續性受僱的情況。符合新規定的僱員，如同時滿足條例相關條件，例如年資，便可享有各項法定僱傭福利，包括法定假日薪酬、有薪年假等。另外，隨着較短工時僱員的權益得到改善，我們相信有助吸引更多人投入勞動市場。法案委員會委員普遍支持《條例草案》的修訂建議。

在今日的辯論中，我聽到各位議員提出幾個關注點：第一點以勞工派議員為主，擔心僱主會想辦法規避「連續性合約」的新規定。這裏我想表達一個意見，但凡任何規定總有方法被繞過，問題是成本和難度有多高，所以修訂新的「4-68」規定，僱主要付出更高成本才可不符合這個要求，讓更多僱員受惠。我非常認同委員會主席葉劉淑儀所說的一個例子，她提到有不少的僱員尤其是婦女，提出認為不公允的地方——其上班時間並不短，但由於要四個星期連續計算，認為僱主到了第四個星期就把工時降到17小時或以下，故此一直無法成為「連續性合約」，因而享受不到其認為應有的僱員福利。

勞顧會討論了這麼長時間，這也正是邵家輝議員提到，大家就這點磋商了很久，但最後都秉承互諒互讓的精神而達成協議。我認為這牽涉大家認為是否公道。尤其是在調整工時方面，很多時僱主佔比較主導的地位，僱員是相對被動的身分，所以僱員希望我們在法例下面多給予他們保障，不要出現不公平狀況。我理解實剛才邵家輝指如果由僱員主導，他們又可以想辦法令自己「着數」，但這個是假設由僱員說了算，但現實上並不是。在實質的工作場景中，僱主僱員是互動的，無一方佔全部主動，所以大家一定要抱着互諒互讓的精神，即使在現時「4-18」規定下，如果全由僱員說了算，邵家輝議員所說的情景同樣可以發生。為何現時沒有發生呢？是因為調整工時安排時，僱主有一定的主導性，不會讓僱員在現有條件下得到所有好處，現時即使由「4-18」變「4-68」，也沒有改變以上的情況。

為何我會說這麼長？因為我很少見勞工派議員那麼苦口婆心地勸邵議員和其黨友，請大家支持經過勞顧會多年磋商，難得達成共識的意見。我在這裏也參與其中，苦口婆心勸邵議員和各位黨員，想一想由「4-18」變「4-68」是經過很長時間的商討，在勞顧會中爭論了很久。今日大家所說不同的情景——對方如何出蠱惑，另一方又會如何應對——通通都談過了。勞顧會的勞方和資方代表是同等比例，在這麼艱難的狀況下大家也可以談攏，為何來到議會卻不可接受勞顧會磋商已久的方案？我明白大家可能認為現時營商環境比較困難，但法律的修訂並非用於一時三刻，法例的修訂是千秋萬世的。

我們花了這麼多時間，希望香港不斷進步，在可行範圍內，香港作為一個先進發達的社會，是否應該對勞方僱員作一些合理的關顧？尤其是大家覺得，原以為長期替你工作，明明每個月的總工時很長，但當中總有一個星期叫僱員減少工作，突然關注讓僱員的休息時間，那是否對僱員公平呢？我只想提出這個看法，這個看法正正在勞顧會上談了很久，開端是由我本人擔任勞工處處長時，到我做了局長，新處長上任，大家一直在談這個問題。政府樂見勞顧會中勞資雙方互諒互讓，從對方的角度去想問題，然後達成共識。老實說這個方案資方要讓步、勞方同樣都要讓步，只有雙方各讓半步，大家才可以結伴走。

我希望今日是一個真正的辯論，大家各抒己見，我真的很希望通過辯論，如果仍然有異議的議員，還有幾分鐘時間，大家想一想是否應該顧全大局，顧及勞顧會花了這麼多時間商討，從一個互諒互讓的角度去決定如何投今日的一票。我希望通過這次的辯論，大家可以為香港的整體利益作出表態。

另外，我知道大家都非常關心平台工作者。目前，平台工作者大多數並非僱員的身分，因為他們並不符合僱員的定義要求，是屬於一個新形態的工作。就大家都關心的平台工作者，我們已同一時間開展工作，尤其針對他們最關注的範疇──在他們發生意外後的補償及後續處理，我們會做好工夫的。但是他們大多數的身分不是僱員，如果他的工作形態是僱員的話，即使他們是平台工作者，一樣是受僱傭條例的保障。

主席，我相信今日大多數議員和政府都有共同目標，就是讓《條例草案》盡早獲得通過。如獲立法會通過，修訂條例會在刊憲後六個月的首個星期日生效，讓僱主和僱員有充分時間作好準備。其間政府會經各途徑宣傳和解說，並會以淺白易明的方式向公眾解釋修訂條例，提高僱主及僱員對修訂條例的認識。政府亦會在修訂條例實施後，監察勞資關係的變化和情況。

我懇請各位議員支持及通過政府提出的《條例草案》，讓我們盡快展開下一階段的工作，讓「打工仔」早日受惠。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

立法會十四題：公共與私營場所的家庭友善設施,2025-06-18 17:20,2025-06-18 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800557.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上顏汶羽議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉，平等機會委員會的研究團隊對香港商場及政府處所進行了育嬰及哺乳設施的審核，結果顯示部分商場和政府處所尚未設置育嬰及哺乳室，並且部分現有育嬰空間的面積未符合屋宇署《在商業樓宇提供育嬰間及哺集乳室》作業備考（作業備考）的建議面積。關於公共與私營場所的家庭友善設施，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，公共與私營場所中育嬰及哺乳設施的數量、分布情況、所佔面積比例，以及當中設施符合作業備考建議面積的比率，並按全港18區分項列出相關數據；

（二）是否已就促進公共場所設置育嬰及哺乳設施的相關措施展開研究，包括強制要求新建的公營設施（例如圖書館、公園、海灘、體育場館等）設置育嬰及哺乳設施，並推動現有公營設施進行適當改建和加裝育嬰及哺乳設施；若是，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）除提供建築面積寬免外，有否考慮通過政策優惠措施，鼓勵私營場所提供育嬰及哺乳設施，以及家庭友善車位，並利用行政措施或立法長遠推動該等設施的建設；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

國際文獻及研究顯示，母乳是嬰兒最理想的食物。母乳既安全衞生，亦含有抗體，有助於預防許多常見的兒童疾病。餵哺母乳的兒童在智力測驗中表現較佳，而且較少機會出現超重或肥胖等情況，日後罹患糖尿病的機會亦較低。

政府一直循多方面致力推廣、維護及支持母乳餵哺。政府於二○一四年成立了「促進母乳餵哺委員會」，成員包括來自相關的醫護專業團體、學術界及參與推廣母乳餵哺的組織代表，就加強推廣、維護和支持母乳餵哺有關的策略及行動計劃提供具體建議，目標是提高母乳餵哺的持續性，並令母乳餵哺成為社會大眾接受的育嬰模式。此外，政府一方面推動公共場所成為「母乳餵哺友善場所」，支持授乳母親隨時餵哺孩子或擠母乳，另一方面亦積極在母嬰健康院及公立醫院推行「愛嬰醫療機構」認證，以加強對出院後授乳母親的專業支援。現時，共有15間母嬰健康院獲「愛嬰醫療機構」認證。此外，全港八間設有婦產科的公立醫院和一間私家醫院已獲認證為「愛嬰醫院」。

就顏汶羽議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署、醫院管理局（醫管局），以及相關政策局和政府部門後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）根據衞生署的紀錄，截至二○二五年六月十五日，設於政府部門或公共機構處所內的育嬰間共有422間（分項數字載於附件一及二），當中包括不同類別的場所，例如醫院、母嬰健康院、文康設施、社區會堂及屋邨商場等。

為推廣私人商業樓宇設置育嬰間，屋宇署於二○○九年二月發出有關《在商業樓宇提供育嬰間設施》作業備考，並已於二○一八年十一月更新，鼓勵在私人商業樓宇內設置供公眾使用的育嬰間和供員工使用的哺集乳室。此外，屋宇署於二○二四年六月更新了綠色建築環境評估認證及總樓面面積豁免的要求，容許尋求認證的發展項目透過設置育嬰間及哺集乳室爭取認證評分及總樓面面積豁免。

（二）及（三）政府一直積極透過各種不同政策措施，推動更多公共和私營場所設置育嬰及哺乳設施。

政府已在二○○八年八月制定《育嬰間設置指引》，鼓勵在政府管理的公共場所設置育嬰間。為加強設置育嬰及哺乳設施，自二○一九年初起，政府規定於新落成政府處所設置供公眾和員工使用的育嬰及哺乳設施。其中，就問題第二部分提及的公營設施，康樂及文化事務署已按相關規定將育嬰間設定為標準設施，在策劃新的大型文娛康樂設施和進行場地改善工程時增設有關的育嬰設施。

另外，政府已自二○一七年起，在新推售的商業用地（不包括酒店專屬用地）的賣地條件列出詳細的規定，包括在該等商業發展項目須設置的育嬰間及／或哺乳設施的面積和數目。截至二○二五年五月底，政府已在八幅新商業用地的賣地條件中加入相關要求。

與此同時，政府會繼續聯同社會各界緊密合作，加強醫護界對授乳母親的專業支援之餘，透過不同途徑在社區加強宣傳母乳餵哺，以期推動社會積極支持母乳餵哺的文化和創造便利母乳餵哺的友善環境。重點工作包括：

（i） 衞生署轄下正提供服務的29間母嬰健康院中已有15間獲得「愛嬰醫療機構」認證，其餘的母嬰健康院亦已陸續開展認證程序。母嬰健康院會訂立嬰兒餵哺政策及行動計劃、為員工提供相關培訓，以及持續監察母乳餵哺支援措施的落實情況等。衞生署會繼續加快為母嬰健康院取得「愛嬰醫療機構」認證，以加強醫療機構及人員對哺乳母親的專業支援；

（ii） 繼續與「促進母乳餵哺委員會」下的工作小組跟進相關工作，以加強及鞏固產科醫院（包括公立和私營醫院）的母乳餵哺友善措施；

（iii） 鼓勵實施「母乳餵哺友善工作間」政策，並已為僱主和僱員推出指引，提供支持母乳餵哺的具體建議，以便在職母親返回工作崗位後繼續餵哺母乳；以及

（iv） 透過大眾傳播媒介、社交媒體及大型活動等加強宣傳和倡導母乳餵哺。其中，衞生署在二○二四年十一月與醫管局、香港私家醫院聯會、聯合國兒童基金香港委員會和愛嬰醫院香港協會舉辦了大型母乳哺育研討會。本地和外地專家聚首一堂，與公私營醫療機構的代表、醫護專業人員及其他持分者分享有關母乳餵哺的不同議題，包括政策和專業支援。

為進一步支持母乳餵哺，政府於《行政長官2023年施政報告》提出在二○二五年成立母乳庫及建立母乳捐贈機制，為未能由其親生母親餵哺母乳的嬰幼兒提供母乳，尤其減低早產及重病嬰兒患上重症的機會。設於香港兒童醫院的香港母乳庫於二○二五年一月六日投入服務，同年四月獲得ISO 22000認證，並在二○二五年三月向全港九間設有新生兒深切治療部的公立醫院供應經處理的捐贈母乳。現時已有230多名登記母乳捐贈者，並收集超過900公升母乳，供應予極早產及患有危疾的初生嬰兒，讓他們獲得最佳營養。同時，公立醫院的新生兒深切治療部已向共120名有臨床需要的嬰兒派發經處理的捐贈母乳。

經諮詢相關政策局及政府部門，現時政府並無以泊車位作為家庭友善設施的相關定義及措施。"
LCQ14: Family-friendly facilities in public and private premises,2025-06-18 17:20,2025-06-18 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800570.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

  It is learnt that the research team of the Equal Opportunities Commission has conducted an access audit of babycare and lactation (B&L) facilities in shopping malls and government premises in Hong Kong, with the findings revealing that some shopping malls and government premises has not yet provided B&L rooms, and some existing babycare areas do not comply with the suggested size set out in the Buildings Department's Practice Note on ""Provision of Babycare Rooms and Lactation Rooms in Commercial Buildings"" (Practice Note). As regards family-friendly facilities in public and private premises, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the number, distribution and floor area ratio of B&L facilities in public and private premises, and the proportion of such facilities that complies with the suggested size in the Practice Note, together with a breakdown of such figures by the 18 districts across the territory;

(2) whether it has already commenced a study on measures to promote the provision of B&L facilities in public premises, including introducing mandatory requirements for newly-built public facilities (e.g. libraries, parks, beaches, sports venues) to provide B&L facilities, and motivating existing public facilities to renovate and retrofit B&L facilities as appropriate; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether, in addition to providing floor area ratio concessions, it has considered implementing policy incentives to encourage private premises to provide B&L facilities and family-friendly parking spaces, as well as using administrative measures or legislation to promote the development of such facilities in the long term; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  International literature and researches showed that breastmilk is the ideal food for infants. Breastmilk is safe, clean and contains antibodies which can help prevent many common childhood illnesses. Breastfed children perform better in intelligence tests, are less likely to be overweight or obese, and are less prone to have diabetes later in life.

  The Government has all along been promoting, protecting and supporting breastfeeding through a multi-pronged approach. The Government has set up a Committee on Promotion of Breastfeeding in 2014. Members include representatives from relevant professional healthcare bodies, academia as well as representatives of the organisations that have participated in the promotion of breastfeeding. The Committee provides specific recommendations on strategies and action plans to strengthen the promotion, protection and support for breastfeeding. Its objectives are to enhance the sustainability of breastfeeding and promote breastfeeding as the norm for babycare widely accepted by the general public. In addition to fostering the establishment of Breastfeeding Friendly Premises in public places such that breastfeeding mothers can breastfeed their children or express milk anytime, the Government also implements the Baby-Friendly Health Facility accreditation in the Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) and public hospitals to enhance the professional support to breastfeeding mothers after discharge from hospitals. At present, a total of 15 MCHCs have been accredited as Baby-Friendly Health Facilities. Besides, all eight public hospitals with obstetrics departments and one private hospital were accredited as Baby-Friendly Hospitals.

  In consultation with the Department of Health (DH), the Hospital Authority (HA), as well as relevant policy bureaux and government departments, the consolidated reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu is as follows:

(1) According to the DH's record, as at June 15, 2025, there were a total of 422 babycare rooms in the premises of government departments or public organisations (a breakdown of the numbers are at Annexes 1 and 2), which include various types of venues, such as hospitals, MCHCs, cultural and recreational facilities, community halls and shopping centres of housing estates.

  To promote the provision of babycare rooms in private commercial buildings, the Buildings Department (BD) issued the Practice Note on the Provision of Babycare Rooms in Commercial Buildings in February 2009 and had made further updates in November 2018 to encourage the provision of babycare rooms for the public and lactation rooms for staff in private commercial buildings. In June 2024, the BD updated the requirements for Building Environmental Assessment Method Plus certification and gross floor area (GFA) concessions to allow development projects seeking certification to secure the points and GFA concession through the provision of babycare rooms and breastfeeding rooms.

(2) and (3) The Government has been actively promoting the provision of more babycare and breastfeeding facilities in both public and private premises through various policy measures.

  The Government developed the Advisory Guidelines on Babycare Facilities in August 2008 to encourage the provision of babycare rooms in public venues managed by the Government. To enhance the provision of babycare and breastfeeding facilities, the Government mandated the provision of babycare and breastfeeding facilities in the newly completed government premises since early 2019. Regarding the public facilities mentioned in part 2 of the question, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department has included babycare rooms as a standard provision in accordance with relevant requirements, and will provide babycare facilities in planning for new major cultural and recreational facilities, as well as venue renovation works.

  Additionally, since 2017, the Government has included requirements for the provision of babycare rooms and/or lactation rooms in the Conditions of Sale of new commercial land sale sites (excluding land designated for hotel use only). The Conditions of Sale specify detailed requirements, including the area and number of babycare rooms and/or lactation rooms that shall be provided in these commercial development projects. As at the end of May 2025, the Government incorporated these requirements in the Conditions of Sale of eight new commercial sites.

  Meanwhile, the Government will continue to work closely with various sectors of the society to strengthen the professional support for breastfeeding mothers in the healthcare sector while stepping up publicity on breastfeeding in the community through various channels, with a view to fostering a proactive culture of support for breastfeeding in the community and creating a friendly environment conducive to breastfeeding. Key initiatives include –

(i) among the 29 MCHCs currently providing services under the DH, 15 of them have been accredited as Baby-Friendly Health Facilities. Accreditation procedures have also commenced gradually for the remaining MCHCs. The MCHCs will formulate infant feeding policies and action plans, provide training for staff members, continue monitoring the implementation of breastfeeding support measures, etc. The DH will continue to expedite the accreditation of Baby-Friendly Health Facilities for MCHCs to strengthen the professional support offered by the healthcare institutions and staff members to breastfeeding mothers;

(ii) continuing to follow up on the relevant work with the working group under the Committee on Promotion of Breastfeeding to enhance and reinforce the breastfeeding-friendly measures at hospitals with obstetrics departments (including public and private hospitals);

(iii) encouraging the implementation of the Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace policy with guidelines issued for employers and employees with specific advice on supporting breastfeeding to support working mothers to continue breastfeeding after returning to work; and

(iv) stepping up publicity and advocacy for breastfeeding through mass media, social media platforms, large-scale events, etc. Among others, the DH, in collaboration with the HA, the Hong Kong Private Hospitals Association, the Hong Kong Committee for United Nations Children's Fund, and the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative Hong Kong Association, organised the large-scale Breastfeeding Symposium in November 2024, which brought together local and overseas experts to share with representatives of the public and private healthcare sectors, healthcare professionals and other stakeholders the various issues related to breastfeeding, including policies and professional support.

  To further support breastfeeding, the Government put forward in the Chief Executive's 2023 Policy Address the establishment of a breast milk bank and the related mechanism for breast milk donation in 2025. Such arrangement aims to provide breast milk for infants and young children who cannot be breastfed by their biological mothers, and especially, to minimise the chance of severe illness in premature and severely-ill babies. The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank, located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital, commenced operations on January 6, 2025, obtained ISO 22000 certification in April of the same year, and began supplying pasturised donor breast milk to all nine public hospitals in Hong Kong with neonatal intensive care units in March 2025. Currently, there are more than 230 registered breast milk donors. Over 900 litres of breast milk have been collected, providing optimal nutrition for extremely premature and severely-ill newborn babies. Meanwhile, neonatal intensive care units in public hospitals have already distributed pasturised donor breast milk to 120 infants with clinical needs.

  Meanwhile, having consulted the relevant policy bureaux and government departments, the Government currently does not have any relevant definitions and measures on the use of parking spaces as family-friendly facilities."
立法會十三題：醫藥分家,2025-06-18 17:15,2025-06-18 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800564.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上邵家輝議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉，全球有不少地方已實施醫藥分家制度（即醫生負責診症和處方，而患者憑處方到社區藥房配藥）多年。有意見認為，此制度有提升用藥安全和專業分工、避免用藥受局限、推動患者分流、減少利益衝突，以及降低醫療成本等正面作用。然而，有本港的藥房和藥劑業界及社會人士爭取香港實施有關制度逾廿年，政府至今未有確切回應。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否研究，現時內地和海外有哪些地方已經實施或正計劃實施醫藥分家制度及其效益；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，本港公營及私營醫院已實施由醫生負責診症和處方、藥劑師負責配發藥物的安排，而藥劑師作為市民服用藥物前的最後專業把關者，已將與藥物有關的醫療事故風險大大減少，當局仍未將有關安排擴展至醫療系統各層面（包括讓病人憑公立醫院醫生或私人執業醫生的處方於合資格社區藥房配藥）的原因為何；

（三）過去10年，有否研究或採取具體行動，以在本港實施醫藥分家制度；如有，詳情（包括多年來未有在香港實施相關制度的原因）為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）會否參考其他已實施醫藥分家制度的地方的成功經驗，盡早在香港實施該制度；如會，詳情和實施時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就邵家輝議員提問的各部分，經諮詢衞生署、基層醫療署和醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現回覆如下：

一般而言，「醫藥分家」是指一般情況下只容許醫生為病人作出診斷病症和開出處方，而配發藥物給病人的工作則必須另行由註冊藥劑師或其監督下的配藥員進行。換言之，實施「醫藥分家」安排即表示需要把配藥這項醫生一直以來可以負責的工作，以法定形式指定由註冊藥劑師分開施行，同時規定醫生（包括家庭醫生）診所如無註冊藥劑師不得安排配藥。

政府留意到部分歐美國家和鄰近地區（包括韓國和中國台灣地區）有實施「醫藥分家」模式，主要目標是讓醫生和藥劑師能專注其專業範疇，希望藉此提升用藥安全。然而，這些地方仍有特定情況容許醫生提供藥物給就診病人，這些地方的實行經驗亦顯示「醫藥分家」可能降低市民配藥的便利性，有機會使醫療成本上升，並對市民求醫習慣帶來重大改變。事實上，世界各地的醫療體系（包括診症和配藥的分工）均有所不同，必須結合當地的專業發展、社會需求和城市規劃來制定合適的政策，因地制宜，平衡專業分工與便民需求，才能有效優化醫療資源分配，提升整體醫療服務效率與安全性。

現時香港的公營醫院、公營診所及私家醫院均一直採取由醫生負責診症和處方，藥劑師負責配發藥物的安排，以切合實際需要。在私家醫生診所方面，病人亦有權選擇要求私家醫生開出處方，由病人自行到社區內的持牌藥房由藥劑師配發藥物。政府一向十分重視私營診所的配藥安全。為確保對病人的保障，香港醫務委員會制定的《香港註冊醫生專業守則》（《守則》）包括有關向病人配處藥物的規定。根據現行的《守則》（二○二二年十月修訂）第9.2節規定，醫生如為病人配處藥物，醫生本人有責任確保藥物符合處方內容並已妥為標籤，然後才發給病人。醫生應該訂立適當的程序，並參照香港醫學會發出的《良好配藥操作手冊》的規定，確保藥物妥為標籤及配處。

香港醫療專業水平高，現行法例及相關醫療人員規管措施一直以來有效保障藥物安全。在考慮任何改變診症和配藥的安排時，應着重醫生、藥劑師和其他醫療專業人員之間的合作，並以病人的福祉為依歸。在香港實施「醫藥分家」對於現時醫療系統內醫生的角色、醫護專業人力需求及配套設施，以至基層醫療服務安排和成本效益等有深遠影響，必須從長計議。

政府現時沒有計劃強制實行「醫藥分家」，但會在推動基層醫療改革時令社區內家庭醫生和其他醫護專業，在提供全面和連貫的基層醫療服務上加強協作，包括繼續實施一系列「醫藥協作」安排，利用好社區內的持牌藥房和藥劑師，進一步便利市民診症配藥、降低醫療成本，並確保求醫用藥的安全性，同時讓市民可選擇其配藥安排。具體例子包括：

（1）藥劑師在基層醫療系統中一向在不同層面發揮積極作用，包括支援家庭醫生監察藥物依從性，以及與護士等醫護專業在促進健康和健康教育上合作，以互補協作的模式協助預防和管理疾病、推廣藥物安全、戒煙和疫苗接種。目前社區的專業藥劑服務及藥物配發服務亦未盡其用，藥劑師於基層醫療的角色亦有待加強。政府正按《基層醫療健康藍圖》推動建立以社區為本的跨醫療專業團隊，當中會加強藥劑師在跨專業醫護管理的角色，同時會推動社區藥房的發展，讓市民可以選擇在社區接受藥物諮詢服務，達致「小病在社區」的目標，具體措施包括：

（i）政府正籌備於二○二五年第四季制訂社區藥物名冊，以及於二○二六年第四季分階段推出社區藥房計劃，讓市民可選擇透過家庭醫生和社區藥房，更便捷地獲得價格相宜的基層醫療藥物，藥劑師亦會在過程中定期檢視病人的用藥劑量和療效，從而改善病人的用藥情況及減少藥物浪費；

（ii）基層醫療署正擬訂《基層醫療社區藥房指引》，建立社區藥房的服務標準和質素保證，以及規範社區藥房與基層醫療服務提供者的協作模式；基層醫療署亦將會安排為藥劑師、藥劑系學生和專業人員提供培訓課程，並把該課程納入香港藥劑業及毒藥管理局未來認可持續進修的要求，為制定涵蓋藥劑師的《基層醫療指南》作準備；以及

（iii）地區康健中心會與社區藥房組成網絡，加強社區藥物配發和藥劑諮詢服務，強化地區康健中心作為基層醫療服務樞紐的同時，也為市民提供專業的藥劑服務。

（2）現行醫管局的藥物送遞服務下，病人可以就診後安排把藥物送遞至家中或指定地址，或到醫管局協作藥房領取藥物，使用者需支付藥物費用及送遞費。當社區藥房計劃推出後，計劃下的藥劑師亦可為合資格的醫管局病人提供指定藥物名單中的藥物覆配服務，包括有需要時服用的藥物和一些治療慢性疾病的藥物，並可分期向病人配發，而病人只需要付醫管局的藥物費用，無需額外支付送遞費。

（3）藥物管理是病人護理的重要一環。在「醫健通+」五年發展計劃下，政府會通過醫健通平台的數據連接，整合不同醫護提供者的藥物紀錄及相關醫療服務。政府亦會研究推出電子處方，實現醫護提供者、藥房及相關持份者之間安全、實時和雙向的藥物紀錄連接，從而提高處方準確性、流程效率及藥物安全。為配合有關發展，政府今年已向立法會提交《2025年電子健康紀錄互通系統（修訂）條例草案》，為經由醫健通簽發或認證的電子醫療文件提供清晰法律框架，並在合適的情況下，讓政府指定醫健通作為某些醫療文件的單一簽發平台，以便集中管理和支援使用流程。

在上述的社區藥物名冊和社區藥房計劃下，「醫健通+」作為支援基層醫療服務的重要平台，將擔當醫管局、社區藥房及相關醫護提供者之間的關鍵橋樑。政府會配合未來社區藥房及基層醫療服務的協同發展，連結及整合醫管局及不同醫護提供者的藥物紀錄，支援藥物處方及配藥等藥物管理流程。另外，上述《基層醫療指南》分支指南內的服務提供者均需要參與醫健通，促進數據互通以提升醫療服務的連貫性。

（4）就第二層及第三層醫療涉及醫院和專科服務，政府一直致力提高私營醫療服務收費透明度，讓市民按其需要作出醫療決定前，已能掌握更充分的價目資料，事先預備所需的費用。醫務衞生局於今年五月九日向立法會衞生事務委員會簡介初步立法建議及長遠優化措施，包括推動醫療服務範圍及收費項目標準化，涵蓋監察藥物的處方和收費情況。政府正陸續約見持份者，包括醫療衞生界、保險業界、病人組織和學術機構等，就構思詳情進行更深入諮詢，以期於二○二六年提交規例草案，逐步落實相關優化措施。"
LCQ13: Separation of prescribing from dispensing of drugs,2025-06-18 17:15,2025-06-18 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800567.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

  It is learnt that the system of separating prescribing from dispensing of drugs (SPD) (i.e. doctors are responsible for consultation and prescription while patients go to community pharmacies for dispensing of drugs with their prescriptions) has been implemented worldwide for many years. There are views that such a system has the positive effects of enhancing drug safety and professional segregation of duties, avoiding limitations in the use of drugs, promoting patient triage, reducing conflicts of interests and lowering healthcare costs, etc. However, despite local pharmacies and the pharmaceutical trade as well as members of the community have been striving for implementing the system in Hong Kong for more than two decades, the Government has not given definite responses so far. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has studied which places in the Mainland and overseas have already implemented or are currently planning to implement SPD and its effectiveness;

(2) as there are views pointing out that the arrangement of doctors being responsible for consultation and prescription and pharmacists for dispensing drugs has already been implemented in public and private hospitals in Hong Kong, and that pharmacists, who are the last professional gatekeepers for members of the public before taking drugs, have greatly reduced the risk of drug-related medical incidents, of the reasons for not extending the arrangement to all levels of the healthcare system by the authorities (including allowing the dispensing of drugs in qualified community pharmacies to patients with prescriptions by doctors in public hospitals or private medical practitioners);

(3) whether it studied or took specific actions in the past decade to implement SPD in Hong Kong; if so, of the details (including the reasons for not implementing the relevant system in Hong Kong over the years); if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) whether it will make reference to the successful experience of other places where SPD has been implemented, with a view to implementing the system in Hong Kong as early as possible; if so, of the details and implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Department of Health (DH), the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) and the Hospital Authority (HA), the reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai is set out below.

  Generally, ""Separation of Prescribing from Dispensing of Drugs"" (SPD) means that, under normal circumstances, doctors are only allowed to diagnose and prescribe medicines for patients, while the role of drug dispensing must be carried out separately by registered pharmacists or dispenser under registered pharmacist's supervision. In other words, implementation of SPD arrangement statutorily designates drug dispensing, which has all along been able to be performed by doctors, to be separately performed by registered pharmacists, and at the same time requires that drug dispensing cannot be carried out in doctor (including family doctor) clinics without the presence of a registered pharmacist.

  The Government notes that some European and American countries, as well as neighbouring regions (including Korea and China's Taiwan region), have adopted the mode of SPD. The main objective is to enable doctors and pharmacists to focus on their professional areas, with a view to enhancing medication safety. Nevertheless, there are specified exemptions in these places that allow doctors to supply medicines to patients who attend medical consultations. Meanwhile, the implementation experience of these places also shows that SPD may potentially reduce the convenience of the public in obtaining medications, increase medical cost, and bring about significant changes in people's healthcare-seeking habits. In fact, healthcare systems (including the division of labour between consultation and dispensing drugs) vary across the world. It is crucial to formulate appropriate policies in the light of local professional development, social needs and city planning. By taking into account the local conditions and balancing the division of labour among various professions with public convenience, the distribution of healthcare resources can be effectively optimised, and the efficiency and safety of healthcare services can be enhanced as a whole.

  At present, public hospitals, public clinics as well as private hospitals in Hong Kong have adopted the arrangement that doctors are responsible for consultation and prescription, while pharmacists are responsible for the dispensing of drugs, to meet the practical needs. As regards private doctor clinics, patients have the right to request prescriptions from private doctors and have their drug dispensed by pharmacists at licensed pharmacies in the community. The Government has always attached great importance to the safety of drug dispensing in private clinics. For patient protection, the Code of Professional Conduct (the Code) formulated by the Medical Council of Hong Kong includes provisions regarding the dispensing of drugs to patients. According to section 9.2 of the current Code (revised in October 2022), if a doctor dispenses medicine to patients, it is the doctor's personal responsibility to ensure that the drugs are dispensed strictly in accordance with the prescription and are properly labelled before they are handed over to the patients. Doctors should establish suitable procedures and observe the provisions of the Good Dispensing Practice Manual issued by the Hong Kong Medical Association to ensure that drugs are properly labelled and dispensed.

  Hong Kong has a high standard of medical professionalism, and the existing legislation and the relevant regulatory measures for healthcare personnel have been effective in safeguarding drug safety. When considering any changes in consultation and drug dispensing arrangements, emphasis should be placed on the co-operation among doctors, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals, and the well-being of patients should be the primary consideration. The implementation of SPD in Hong Kong will have far-reaching implications on the role of doctors in the current healthcare system, the manpower demand for healthcare professions and the ancillary facilities, as well as the arrangement and cost-effectiveness of primary healthcare services, etc, which must be considered on a long-term basis.

  The Government currently has no plan to make SPD mandatory, but will enable family doctors and other healthcare professions in the community to enhance their collaboration in the provision of comprehensive and coherent primary healthcare services while taking forward primary healthcare reform, including continuing to implement a series of ""medical-pharmaceutical collaboration"" arrangements to make good use of the licensed pharmacies and pharmacists in the community. This will further facilitate the public's access to medical consultation and dispensing of medicines, reduce medical cost, ensure the consultation and medication safety, and provide the public with choices of drug dispensing arrangements. Specific examples include:

(A) Pharmacists have been playing an active role in the primary healthcare system at different levels, including supporting family doctors in monitoring drug compliance, and collaborating with healthcare professions such as nurses in health promotion and health education to assist in the prevention and management of diseases, promotion of drug safety, smoking cessation and vaccination under a complementary and collaborative model. However, the existing professional pharmaceutical services and drug dispensing services in the community are not fully utilised, and the role of pharmacists in primary healthcare could be enhanced. The Government is promoting the establishment of community-based multi-disciplinary healthcare teams in accordance with the Primary Healthcare Blueprint, in which the role of pharmacists in multi-disciplinary healthcare management will be enhanced. At the same time, the Government will also promote the development of community pharmacies so that members of the public can choose to receive drug counselling services in the community, thereby achieving the goal of ""treating mild cases in the community"". Specific measures include:

(i) The Government is preparing to develop a community drug formulary in the fourth quarter of 2025 and will launch the community pharmacy programme (CPP) by phases starting from the fourth quarter of 2026 to enable the public to obtain affordable primary healthcare drugs more conveniently through family doctors and community pharmacies. In the process, pharmacists will also regularly review the dosage and efficacy of the drugs taken by patients to improve their use of medication and reduce drug wastage;

(ii) The PHC Commission is formulating the Guideline of Practice for Community Pharmacy to establish service standards and quality assurance for community pharmacies, and to standardise the collaborative model between community pharmacies and primary healthcare service providers. The PHC Commission will also arrange training courses for pharmacists, pharmacy students and professionals, which will be incorporated into the requirements of the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong for recognising continuing education in the future , in preparation for the formulation of the Primary Care Directory (PCD) which will cover pharmacists; and

(iii) The District Health Centres (DHCs) will form a network with community pharmacies to enhance the dispensing of drugs in the community and pharmaceutical consultation services, so as to strengthen the role of DHCs as a hub for primary healthcare services, while at the same time providing professional pharmaceutical services to members of the public.

(B) Under the current HA medication delivery service, patients can arrange to have their medications delivered to their home or a specified address, or choose to collect them at a pharmacy in collaboration with the HA after their consultation. Users are required to pay for the medications and the delivery fee. After implementation of the CPP, pharmacists under the CPP will also be able to provide eligible HA patients with drug refill services for drugs on the designated drug list, including drugs to be taken when needed and drugs for chronic diseases, and may dispense the drugs in batches to patients. Patients are only required to pay the HA's medication fees with no additional delivery fees.

(C) Medication management is a vital part of patient care. Under the five-year development plan of ""eHealth+"", the Government will integrate the medication records and related healthcare services of various healthcare providers through data connectivity on the eHealth platform. The Government will also explore the introduction of ePrescription to enable secure, real-time and bi-directional connectivity of medication records among healthcare providers, pharmacies and relevant stakeholders, thereby enhancing prescription accuracy, process efficiency and medication safety. To support the relevant development, the Government has submitted the Electronic Health Record Sharing System (Amendment) Bill 2025 to the Legislative Council this year to provide a clear legal framework for electronic medical documents issued or authenticated through eHealth. Where appropriate, the Government may designate eHealth as the only platform for issuance of certain medical documents to facilitate centralised management and support usage process.

  Under the community drug formulary and CPP mentioned above, as an essential platform for supporting primary healthcare services, ""eHealth+"" will serve as a critical bridge between the HA, community pharmacies and relevant healthcare providers. The Government will support the future co-ordinated development of community pharmacies and primary healthcare services by connecting and integrating the medication records of the HA and various healthcare providers, facilitating medication management processes such as medication prescription and drug dispensing. In addition, service providers in the aforementioned sub-guidelines of the PCD are required to register with eHealth to facilitate data sharing, with a view to enhancing the continuity of healthcare services.

(D) For secondary and tertiary healthcare involving hospital and specialist services, the Government has been striving to enhance price transparency of private healthcare services, such that citizens could gain access to more comprehensive price information before making medical decisions according to their needs and better prepare for their expenses. On May 9, 2025, the Health Bureau briefed the Panel on Health Services of the Legislative Council on the preliminary legislative proposals and long-term enhancement measures, including the promotion of standardisation of the scope of healthcare services and chargeable items, covering the monitoring of drug prescription and charging. The Government is progressively engaging with stakeholders, including the healthcare sector, the insurance industry, patient organisations and academic institutions, to conduct more in-depth consultation on the details of the ideas, with a view to introducing the draft regulation in 2026 and implementing relevant enhancement measures by phases."

  The Lujiazui Forum is an international high-level dialogue platform that discusses major issues in the financial sector. This year, the forum was jointly organised by the Shanghai Municipal Government, the People's Bank of China, the National Financial Regulatory Administration, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Themed ""Financial Opening-Up and Cooperation for High-Quality Development in a Changing Global Economy"", the forum has brought together government officials, financial regulators, industry leaders, renowned think tanks and scholars from multiple countries to discuss topics such as global monetary policy, capital market development, financial technology and innovation, and inclusive finance. The plenary session this afternoon will include a session on deepening the co-operation and development of Shanghai and Hong Kong as international financial centres.

  Mr Chan, as one of the key guests, attended the forum's opening ceremony and morning plenary session.

  Before the opening ceremony, Mr Chan and the Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei, jointly witnessed the signing of the Action Plan for Collaborative Development of Shanghai and Hong Kong International Financial Centres, by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, and the Director-General of the Shanghai Office for Advancing International Financial Center Development and Director of the Shanghai Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau, Mr Zhou Xiaoquan.

  The Action Plan covers six areas with a total of 38 measures, including deepening the interconnectivity between Mainland and Hong Kong financial markets, enhancing the linkage and co-operation of the two places' capital markets, supporting eligible Shanghai enterprises to list and raise funds in Hong Kong, and strengthening collaboration in areas such as commodity trading, reinsurance, green finance and fintech. The aim is to further leverage the financial opening up, development and risk management advantages of the two cities, enhance cross-boundary and offshore financial co-operation, and promote the co-ordinated development of the two international financial centres.

  In his speech at the ceremony, Mr Chan said that the Action Plan further specifies the directions of co-operation between Hong Kong and Shanghai, thereby injecting new and richer content into multi-level and multi-field financial collaboration. It includes, first, new measures to deepen financial interconnectivity; second, highlighting support for Mainland enterprises to go global; and third, promoting standard alignment and financial innovation. With strong support from the country, Hong Kong and Shanghai, as two international financial centres, will join forces to create greater synergy and collaborative benefits, thus making greater contributions to the country's development as a financial powerhouse while also injecting Chinese wisdom and strength into the development of the global financial market.

  Yesterday (June 17), upon arriving in Shanghai, Mr Chan attended an international exchange dinner hosted by the China Finance 40 Forum. Attendees included leaders from domestic and international financial institutions, regulatory bodies, think tanks and academia. At the dinner, Mr Chan shared how Hong Kong is striving to promote high-quality financial development amid global political and economic changes. This includes advancing financial market reforms to better attract global capital to support the development of the real economy, supporting the prudent advancement of Renminbi internationalisation, embracing financial innovation including digital assets, and providing comprehensive, high value-added services for Mainland enterprises' international development. The goal is to better contribute to the country's financial reform and high-level opening up while creating opportunities for global investors and businesses.

  Mr Chan departed for Hong Kong around noon today."
立法會：署理商務及經濟發展局局長就「以新質生產力激發香港中小型企業蓬勃發展，積極對接國家高質量『出海』戰略」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-06-18 16:40,2025-06-18 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800592.htm,"以下是署理商務及經濟發展局（商經局）局長陳百里博士今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上，就「以新質生產力激發香港中小型企業蓬勃發展，積極對接國家高質量『出海』戰略」議員議案的開場發言：

主席：

我感謝陳祖恒議員提出這項動議，亦感謝嚴剛議員提出的修正案，讓我們與各位議員交流，以新質生產力激發香港中小企業蓬勃發展和對接國家高質量出海戰略。兩位議員的建議與政府的政策方向同出一轍。

環球市場持續波動，加上美國的單邊主義加深對全球市場的衝擊。但有危便有機，國家推動新質生產力發展，內地企業在高新科技的領域更是領先世界，香港會把握好機遇，加快創科發展以配合國家的戰略方向，同時充分發揮好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色連接內地與全球市場，吸引內地具潛力的企業到港，善用香港的環球網絡和國際金融中心的功能。同時，政府會鼓勵港商更深更廣地開拓內地業務，把握國家雙循環策略帶來的龐大商機。

從近期各項數據可見，環球投資者對香港的信心正在增強。二○二四年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司總數達9 960間，其中內地駐港公司佔比最多，約有2 600間。商經局轄下的投資推廣署在去年協助了539間企業在港開設和擴展業務，按年增長超過四成，而與新質生產力相關的創新及科技業佔榜首，有120間之多。

因應環球地緣政治和貿易格局劇變，加上部分供應鏈正向「全球南方」及「一帶一路」沿線國家遷移，投資推廣署和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）已在去年底設立高增值供應鏈服務機制，吸引內地企業到港建立管理離岸貿易和供應鏈的國際或區域總部，以及提供一站式諮詢服務，協助內地企業出海。

商經局「一帶一路」辦公室協助中小企業與內地企業聯手開拓「一帶一路」商機。行政長官於五月率領由香港和內地企業代表組成的代表團前往卡塔爾和科威特訪問，與中東地區進一步建立政府之間的關係，成功推動多方面的成果，務實推動內地企業夥拍香港專業服務業，一同開拓環球機遇。

同時，貿發局透過大型國際會議、訪問團及外展活動，介紹香港機遇及作為雙向投資平台的角色，促進香港與內地企業、專業服務團隊和「一帶一路」沿線國家項目擁有者的合作。

在標準認證方面，三地認證機構等在工業消費品、農食產品和服務業等領域，建基於粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）共通執行的「灣區標準」，已開展高端的品質認證活動。政府會繼續推動有關「灣區標準」和「灣區認證」的工作，促進粵港澳三地互聯互通和融合發展。

香港致力為內地企業提供多元（例如銀行、證券、會計等）的金融專業服務和有效的投融資渠道。我們會繼續善用香港與內地和國際市場的連通優勢，強化全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐功能、深化兩地金融市場互聯互通，並對接國家高質量出海戰略，致力深化與「全球南方」新興市場的聯繫。

律政司推出並落實各項措施提升香港法律及爭議解決服務的國際競爭力。現時，已有超過560名港澳律師取得大灣區律師執業證，可在大灣區內地九市代理民商事案件。在CEPA（《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》）《服務貿易協議》下，「港資港法」措施的適用範圍由深圳前海擴展至深圳市及珠海市，而「港資港仲裁」措施則由內地自貿區進一步涵蓋大灣區內地九市。此外，粵港澳三地法律部門已發布統一的大灣區調解員名冊，大灣區仲裁員名冊的制定工作也正在有序推進中，進一步完善大灣區多元糾紛解決機制，讓企業更便利獲取商事仲裁和調解的服務。

在律政司支持下，大灣區線上爭議解決協作平台的主題網站於二○二四年七月正式推出，提供一站式有關大灣區內爭議解決服務的資訊，讓大灣區城市群中的主要仲裁、調解機構能有效作線上談判及業務合作，實現對大灣區仲調資源的整合。

國家知識產權局與世界知識產權組織共同確定香港生產力促進局為新一批技術與創新支持中心（TISC）的籌建機構。香港的TISC會聚焦向本地初創企業和中小企業提供優質的知識產權資訊及服務，協助它們開發創新潛力，創造、保護、管理和商品化其知識產權。

政府亦會積極協助中小企業利用大灣區為最佳切入點，拓展內地的內銷市場，把握龐大商機，包括透過貿發局的「GoGBA一站式平台」，舉辦各項活動和提供資訊，協助港商在大灣區建立人脈和促進商機。

此外，「BUD專項基金」（「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」）資助企業發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展營銷，在40個已與香港簽署自由貿易協定及／或促進和保護投資協定的經濟體發展業務。我們亦推出了「電商易」，鼓勵企業推行電子商貿項目，促進新質生產力和新業態融合發展。

結語

政府已積極展開上述各項工作，並會因應社會經濟情況和業界需要，不時檢討各項措施，以期協助企業（特別是中小企業）更好應對複雜多變的營商環境，同時促進外來投資，鼓勵更多內地企業落戶香港，以增強香港的經濟發展動能。

主席，我希望先聆聽各位議員對陳祖恒議員動議的意見，稍後在總結發言的時候作詳細回應。今日在席的政府同事亦有政制及內地事務局副局長和創新科技及工業局副局長，他們兩位稍後亦會就其政策局轄下的政策範疇作補充。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

The strong lineup showcased the strength and new blood of the Hong Kong film industry.

In his speech at the Hong Kong New Power Project Showcase Project Pitching Session of the SIFFORUM today (June 18), Mr Mak said that the Hong KongSpecial Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) has always been committed to fostering development of Hong Kong's film industry by supporting film productions and nurturing talent through various funding schemes, encouraging new filmmakers to create high-quality works and explore further and broader markets. In organising this project pitching session, the HKSARG hopes to enhance the visibility of Hong Kong's emerging filmmakers and foster investment partnerships, joining forces on all fronts to drive the high-quality development of Hong Kong and Mainland film industries.

To provide a platform to showcase upcoming Hong Kong film projects in development or production, and facilitate co-operation and investment, five new film projects were presented at the Hong Kong New Power Project Showcase Project Pitching Session, namely ""The Marriage Drive"", ""Open Fire"", ""Altarage"", ""Prison of Love"" and ""The Excreman - On the Road"", with project teams sharing their creative ideas and market potential of their projects with investors and filmmakers in attendance. Special guest mentors, including the Chief Executive Officer of Bona Film Group Co Ltd, Mr Jiang Defu; Senior Vice President of iQiyi Pictures, Mr Ya Ning; and director Anselm Chan were also invited to give professional advice to the project teams.

The CCIDA and the FDC also organised the Making Waves - Navigators of Hong Kong Cinema film programme, presenting seven Hong Kong films at the SIFF, including ""Montages of a Modern Motherhood"", ""An Abandoned Team"", ""Four Trails"" and the restored edition of four classics ""Father and Son"", ""Shanghai Blues"", ""The System"" and ""PTU"". Director Oliver Chan, actors Tam and Lo of ""Montages of a Modern Motherhood"", and director Robin Lee of ""Four Trails"" participated in the post-screening discussions of their films."

《條例草案》修訂「連續性合約」規定的工作時數（工時）門檻，包括將每星期的工時門檻由18小時降低至17小時；及提供另一個以指定四星期工時合計為一個計算單位的方法，如僱員某星期的工時及緊接過去三星期的合計工時達68小時，則即使該星期的工時少於17小時，該星期亦被視為在連續性僱傭期內。

政府發言人說：「自《僱傭條例》實施至今，『連續性合約』規定的工時門檻一直維持在每星期18小時。這次修訂降低『連續性合約』規定的工時門檻，並在計算工時方面加入彈性，減少僱員因偶爾在某星期工時低於門檻便中斷連續性受僱的情況。」

發言人補充：「修訂後《僱傭條例》的其他條文會繼續如常應用，僱員現時享有各項法定權益的資格維持不變，已符合現行『連續性合約』規定的僱員不受影響。」

《2025年僱傭（修訂）條例》將於六月二十七日刊憲。經修訂的「連續性合約」規定將於二○二六年一月十八日起適用，其間政府會經不同途徑宣傳和解說，並會以淺白易明的方式向公眾解釋修訂條例，提高僱主及僱員對修訂條例的認識。"

  The Bill revises the working hours threshold of the ""continuous contract"" requirement, which includes lowering the weekly working hours threshold from 18 hours to 17 hours; and providing an alternative of using the aggregate working hours in a specified four-week period as a counting unit in which a week with less than 17 working hours will still be regarded as a continuous employment period if the sum of the working hours of that week and those of the three weeks immediately preceding it reaches 68 hours.

  A Government spokesman said, ""Since the implementation of the EO, the working hours threshold of the 'continuous contract' requirement has been maintained at 18 hours per week. This amendment exercise lowers the working hours threshold of the 'continuous contract' requirement and introduces flexibility in the calculation of working hours, reducing the circumstances of disrupting the continuity of an employee's employment because the working hours of a week occasionally fall below the threshold.

  ""After the amendments, other provisions of the EO will continue to operate as they currently do, and existing eligibility criteria for employees to enjoy various statutory benefits will remain unchanged. Employees who have met the current 'continuous contract' requirement will not be affected,"" the spokesman added.

  The Employment (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 will be gazetted on June 27, 2025. The revised ""continuous contract"" requirement will be effective from January 18, 2026, onwards. In the meantime, the Government will publicise and brief the public on the Amendment Ordinance through various channels, presenting it in layman's terms to enhance employers' and employees' understanding."

（ii）戶主購置資助出售房屋；
（iii）租戶因違反租約（例如屋邨管理扣分制下兩年內被扣分數累計達十六分或欠租）而遷出；
（iv）租戶未有按規定交回或拒絕交回有關入息及資產的申報表而遷出；
（v）租戶的家庭入息／總資產淨值超過「富戶政策」指明的限額而遷出；
（vi）租戶有成員擁有香港住宅物業而被要求遷出；

答覆：

主席：

就葛珮帆議員的提問，我們現回覆如下：

（一）過去五個財政年度（即二○二○／二一至二○二四／二五年度），香港房屋委員會（房委會）收回的公共租住房屋（公屋）單位數目按其原因載列於附件一。

（二）房委會按照既定的配額政策及計劃，編配新建成及回收後經翻新的公屋單位，以配合各類別申請者的需求。我們會把大部分的單位編配予公屋申請者，並會密切監察其他類別（例如體恤安置類別）的實際編配數字，以確保任何在其他編配類別下多出預計需求的單位會在年度終結前編配予公屋申請者。過去五個財政年度實際編配予公屋申請者和其他類別申請者的回收公屋單位數目載列於附件二。

（三）過去五個財政年度，房委會發出「遷出通知書」的數目，上訴委員會（房屋）接獲的上訴個案數目，以及經上訴委員會（房屋）審理的上訴個案數目和裁決結果按類載列於附件三。

（四）按房委會現行的「批出新租約政策」，公屋戶主離世或遷出後，單位的租約可批予名列於戶籍內的戶主配偶。若戶籍內並無戶主的在生配偶，現居單位內的其中一位認可家庭成員，只要通過定於「富戶政策」水平的「全面經濟狀況審查」及「住宅物業權審查」，便可獲批新租約。在過去五個財政年度，因原戶主離世或遷出而批出的新租約個案約有32 000宗。房屋署沒有備存拒絕批出新租約申請和批出新租約個案中曾獲批增加戶籍成員的統計數字。

（五）過去五個財政年度，房委會批准刪除公屋家庭成員戶籍的個案平均每年約44 000宗，當中約16 700宗為離世或入住安老院舍個案，其餘約27 300宗因遷出或其他原因而獲批刪除戶籍。房屋署並沒有備存獲批准刪除戶籍的個案中多少屬於「富戶」的統計數字。

（六）過去五個財政年度，房委會轄下需要繳交倍半及雙倍淨租金另加差餉的公屋租戶數目載列於附件四。"

Reply:

President,

  In response to the questions raised by the Hon Elizabeth Quat, our reply is as follows:

(1) In the past five financial years (i.e. 2020/21 to 2024/25), the numbers of public rental housing (PRH) units recovered by the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA), categorised by reasons for recovery, are listed in Annex 1.

(2) Based on the established allocation policies and programmes, the HA allocates newly completed and refurbished recovered PRH units to meet the needs of applicants under various categories. We will allocate most of the units to PRH applicants and closely monitor the actual allocation figures of other categories (e.g. Compassionate Rehousing) to ensure that any units in excess of the estimated demand under other categories would be allocated to PRH applicants by the end of the year. In the past five financial years, the actual numbers of recovered PRH units allocated to PRH applicants and applicants under other categories are tabulated in Annex 2.

(3) In the past five financial years, the numbers of Notices-to-quit issued by the HA, the numbers of appeal cases received by the Appeal Panel (Housing), and the numbers of appeal cases heard by the Appeal Panel (Housing) as well as the rulings are set out by category in Annex 3.

(4) According to the HA's existing Policy on Grant of New Tenancy (GNT), upon the death or moving out of the principal tenant of a PRH unit, the tenancy can be granted to his/her spouse who has been listed in the tenancy. If there is no surviving spouse listed in the tenancy, one of the authorised family members currently living in the unit can be granted a new tenancy, provided that the Comprehensive Means Test and Domestic Property Test set at the level of Well-off Tenants Policies are passed. In the past five financial years, there were approximately 32 000 GNT cases approved upon the death or moving out of the original principal tenant. The Housing Department (HD) does not keep statistics on the number of rejected applications for GNT and the number of approved GNT cases which involved addition of household members.

(5) In the past five financial years, the HA approved an average of about 44 000 cases per year on the deletion of family members from PRH tenancies. Among these cases, around 16 700 cases arose from death or admission to elderly homes, while the remaining of about 27 300 cases resulted from moving out or other reasons. The HD does not keep statistics on the number of aforesaid cases which involved ""well-off tenants"".

(6) In the past five financial years, the numbers of PRH tenants under the HA required to pay 1.5 or double net rent plus rates are listed in Annex 4."
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-06-18 15:30,2025-06-18 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800544.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on June 17 to noon today (June 18), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 232 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 144 654 samples of food imported from Japan (including 95 061 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 33 040 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."
LCQ18: Bona vacantia properties,2025-06-18 15:30,2025-06-18 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800494.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Doreen Kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

There are views that along with the demographic changes in Hong Kong, it is expected that the number of bona vacantia properties will continue to increase, which could pose potential challenges to the allocation and management of social resources. It has been reported that in recent years, some gangs have exploited bona vacantia properties to obtain benefits illegally, such as by committing unlawful alienation of the properties, using them for loans or even applying for adverse possession of them, indicating that there are gaps in the regulation of bona vacantia properties. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific number of bona vacantia properties currently under the management of the Lands Department (i.e. those properties originally held by a company that has been dissolved under the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32) or the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622)); the details of the Government's disposal of such properties in the past five years (including the progress of disposal);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of bona vacantia properties in Hong Kong which were once held in personal names; whether the Government has currently put in place a relevant mechanism to dispose of such properties; if not, whether it will consider introducing dedicated measures or mechanisms to prevent such bona vacantia properties from being used for unlawful acts; if so, of the details, and whether the Government will impose administrative charges in the process of disposing of such bona vacantia properties and set clear charging standards in this regard; and

(3) as there are views that the management of bona vacantia properties (including those bona vacantia properties which were once held by private individuals or companies) involves the powers and responsibilities of a number of government departments, whether the Government has put in place a cross-departmental co-ordination mechanism to enhance the efficiency of such work; if not, whether it has plans to further strengthen the cross-departmental collaboration on such work?

Reply:

President,

Bona vacantia properties (BVPs) generally refer to some real properties originally owned by individuals or companies, but the individual owners of properties subsequently dies and no one claims the estate, or the companies were liquidated and dissolved. In accordance with the prevailing laws, real properties owned by individuals or companies are handled by different ordinances to ensure that the rights and interests of the legal owners or successors of the properties will not be infringed and that the properties are properly handled when they become BVPs.

Regarding the properties owned by individuals, the Probate and Administration Ordinance (Cap. 10) provides the jurisdiction of the court to handle matters relating to probate and administration of deceased's estates, including the handling of unclaimed estates of a deceased person. If unclaimed estates involve property assets, the property will be disposed of in an appropriate manner, including sale.

For properties owned by companies, in the course of winding up and dissolution, liquidators will sell properties owned by the companies to pay off outstanding liabilities. If a company, pursuant to the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) or the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32), completes the procedures for winding up and is about to dissolve, every property and right (such as including some properties that are yet to be sold in the market) vested in or held on trust for the company immediately before the dissolution is vested in the Government as bona vacantia. If such bona vacantia property is a land property, it will be managed by the Lands Department on behalf of the Government.

In the past five years (from June 2020 to May 2025), records from the Land Registry show that the number of sales and purchase agreements for building units in Hong Kong was close to 260 000, while the Lands Department received about 50 new cases of BVPs. It can be seen that BVPs only account a very small portion of the overall property market.

In response to the question raised by the Hon Doreen Kong, our reply in consultation with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau is as follows:

(1) As of now, the Lands Department has taken over 411 BVPs previously owned by companies, of which about 30 per cent cases are residential units, industrial units, shops and parking spaces. The remaining 70 per cent are the parts jointly owned with other property owners but inseparable, most of which have no market value and cannot be sold, such as external walls, rooftops, platforms, other common parts. As BVPs, especially the abovementioned 30 per cent cases, often involve unclear ownership, encumbrances or the need to first handle problems such as occupation of units, the Lands Department will carefully clarify the relevant legal rights and seek legal advice after receiving referrals from the Companies Registry, other government departments and the Court, etc. After confirming that the property is a BVP, the Lands Department will notify the Land Registry to add a remark that the property has been vested in the Government as bona vacantia, and choose the most appropriate means to dispose of the property. Generally speaking, if the BVPs are suitable for sale in the market (the appropriate cases among the abovementioned 30 per cent cases), the Lands Department will sell the property by tender. In the past five years (from June 2020 to May 2025), the Lands Department received about 50 new cases of BVPs. The Lands Department also sold 16 BVPs through tendering process in the past five years. As for the properties that cannot be sold (i.e. the abovementioned 70 per cent cases), these will continue to be managed by the Lands Department on behalf.

(2) Section 16 of the Probate and Administration Ordinance (Cap. 10) stipulates the cases in which the Official Administrator, assisted by the Probate Registry, is entitled to administer the unclaimed estate of a deceased person as granted by the Court. If the unclaimed estate concerned involves property asset, the property will be disposed of as appropriate. For any unclaimed balance of deceased's estate, including the money received from the sale of properties, the Official Administrator shall cause an advertisement to invite any claims to be made in accordance with section 23B of the Ordinance. If at the expiration of a period of five years from the date of first publication of such advertisement, the Official Administrator is of the opinion that no claim can reasonably be expected against the estate, the balance of the estate will be transferred to the general revenue of the Government.

Regarding the property fraud issue that the Hon Doreen Kong is concerned about, the current number of cases is still at a low level. Nevertheless, in response to some past fraud cases, the Land Registry will continue to maintain contact and collaboration with the Hong Kong Police Force to exchange information on suspected fraudulent transactions to prevent registrations for properties suspected to have been acquired through fraudulent means. The Property Alert service of the Land Registry will also send email notifications to registered users when the instruments for the sale or mortgage of properties are delivered to the Land Registry for registration.

Besides, the Legislative Council is scrutinising the Registration of Titles and Land (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2025. Under the Land Titles Ordinance (Cap. 585), the title registration system will be implemented on newly granted land first and the Land Registry will be empowered to take measures to reduce the risk of property fraud. Adverse possession will also not be applicable to newly granted land.

(3) As mentioned above, it is not common for BVPs to arise. For BVPs previously owned by companies, the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) currently in force has clearly stipulated the circumstances under which the Government will take over BVPs, and the Lands Department, which is responsible for taking over BVPs, also has a well-established mechanism to properly handle these properties. Therefore, we believe that there is no need to set up an inter-departmental mechanism."
立法會十八題：無主物業,2025-06-18 15:30,2025-06-18 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800493.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上江玉歡議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，隨着香港人口結構變化，預計無主物業的數量將持續增加，對社會資源分配和管理構成潛在挑戰。據報，近年有團夥利用無主物業謀取不法利益，例如將物業非法轉讓或用作借貸，甚至申請逆權管有，顯示無主物業的監管出現缺口。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時地政總署管理的無主物業（即該等本由某公司持有，而該公司已根據《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）或《公司條例》（第622章）解散的物業）的具體數目為何；過去五年，政府處置該類物業的詳情（包括處理進展）為何；

（二）有否統計，全港曾由私人名義持有的無主物業數目；政府目前有否相關機制處理該類物業；若否，會否考慮建立專項措施或機制以防範利用該等無主物業進行不法行為；若有，詳情為何，以及政府在處理該等無主物業的過程中，會否徵收行政費用及訂定清晰的收費標準；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，管理無主物業（包括曾由私人或公司持有的無主物業）涉及多個政府部門的權責，政府有否制訂跨部門協調機制以提升有關工作的效率；若否，有否計劃就有關工作進一步加強跨部門協作？

答覆：

主席：

無主物業一般指一些原本由個人或公司持有的物業，但該物業擁有人後來去世而無人申索其遺產，又或者該公司被清盤和解散。根據現行法律，個人或公司持有的物業會按不同法例處理，以確保物業的合法擁有人或承繼人的權益不會被侵犯，以及當物業成為無主物業後獲得妥善處理。

就個人持有的物業而言，《遺囑認證及遺產管理條例》（第10章）賦予法院處理與遺囑認證及遺產管理相關事宜的管轄權，包括處理無人申索的遺產。若無人申索的遺產中涉及物業資產，該物業會按適當方式處置，包括出售物業。

由公司持有的物業，在其清盤及解散過程中，清盤人會出售公司持有的財產，以償還未清的債項。如果某公司根據《公司條例》（第622章）或《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）完成清盤程序並面臨解散，則在緊接解散前歸屬該公司或以信託形式為該公司持有的所有財產及權利（例如包括一些仍未在市場售出的物業），即屬無主財物並歸屬政府。若該些無主財物屬土地物業，會由地政總署代政府處理。

過去五年（由二○二○年六月至二○二五年五月），土地註冊處的紀錄顯示全港樓宇單位買賣合約的數量接近26萬份，地政總署接收到約50宗無主物業的新個案，可見無主物業只佔整體物業市場一個極小的比例。

就江玉歡議員的提問，經諮詢民政及青年事務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）現時地政總署已接管411個曾由公司持有的無主物業，約三成個案為住宅單位、工廈單位、商鋪和車位，其餘七成為與其他物業業權人共同擁有但不能分割的部分，大多沒有市場價值和未能出售，例如外牆、天台、平台、其他公用部分等。由於無主物業尤其上述三成個案多牽涉業權不清、產權負擔或需先處理單位被佔用等問題，地政總署在收到來自公司註冊處、其他政府部門和法庭等的轉介後，會先小心釐清有關的法律權益並徵詢法律意見，確定物業為無主物業後，便會通知土地註冊處備註物業屬無主財物並歸屬政府，並選擇最適合的處理方式處置有關物業。一般而言，無主物業如適合在市場出售（上述三成個案中的合適個案），地政總署會以招標方式出售有關物業。過去五年（由二○二○年六月至二○二五年五月），地政總署接收到約50宗新個案。地政總署在過去五年亦通過招標程序出售16個無主物業。至於未能出售的物業（上述七成個案），則繼續由地政總署代為管理。

（二）《遺囑認證及遺產管理條例》（第10章）第16條列明了遺產管理官在遺產承辦處的協助下，有權根據法庭授權處理無人申索的遺產的情況。若無人申索的遺產中涉及物業資產，該物業按適當方式處置。就死者遺產中無人申索的餘額，包括出售物業所得的款項，遺產管理官須根據《遺囑認證及遺產管理條例》第23B條刊登廣告，邀請有權申索的人士提出申索。在首次刊登該廣告的日期起計五年屆滿時，遺產管理官如在合理情況下預期不會有人申索有關遺產，則該遺產餘額將會轉撥入政府一般收入。

江玉歡議員關注的物業欺詐問題，目前個案數目仍屬低水平。儘管如此，針對過往一些詐騙個案，土地註冊處會持續與香港警務處保持聯繫與協作，互通涉嫌詐騙交易的資訊，以阻止為涉嫌以欺詐手段而獲得的物業處置註冊。土地註冊處的「物業把關易」服務亦會在出售或抵押物業的文書交付土地註冊處註冊時向已登記的用戶發出電郵通知。

此外，立法會正審議《2025年業權及土地的註冊（雜項修訂）條例草案》，在《土地業權條例》（第585章）下新批土地會先行實施業權註冊制度，並賦權土地註冊處採取措施以減低物業詐騙的風險，而逆權侵佔亦不適用於新批土地。

（三）如上文所述，出現無主物業的情況並不普遍。就曾由公司持有的無主物業，現行的《公司條例》（第622章）已清楚訂明在甚麼情況下政府會接管無主物業，而負責接管的地政總署亦有行之有效的機制妥善處理這些物業。因此，我們認為無須設立跨部門機制。"
立法會七題：打擊電話騙案的措施,2025-06-18 15:30,2025-06-18 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800499.htm,"以下是今日（六月十八日）在立法會會議上邱達根議員的提問和署理商務及經濟發展局局長陳百里博士的書面答覆：

問題：

近年，特區政府採取多元措施，積極打擊電話騙案，包括推出電話智能卡實名登記制（實名登記制）和香港警務處的「防騙視伏App」、要求本地電訊商就新啓動流動電話儲值卡播放提示和攔截可疑來電等，以及與內地和國際執法機構加強合作。然而，有意見指出，本地電話騙案未見減少趨勢，對市民日常生活造成不便和困擾。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）本年一月至五月，警方接獲的電話騙案數目，以及該等案件涉及的金額、受害人數目和年齡分布為何；

（二）自實名登記制推出以來，共有多少張電話儲值卡因相關客戶未能提供合乎登記要求的資料而被拒絕登記；電訊商共取消了多少張未合規的電話儲值卡登記紀錄，並按不合規原因列出分項數字及百分比；

（三）有否估算在實名登記制下，有多少張已登記的電話儲值卡曾經在市場上轉售；針對有關轉售行為，當局現時有何應對措施，以及如何跟進市民購入及使用早已被他人登記的電話卡的個案；

（四）鑑於二○二四年《施政報告》提及，政府會向本會提交禁止轉售已實名登記的電話智能卡的法例修訂建議，以進一步完善實名登記制，有關工作的最新進展及立法時間表為何；

（五）警方自二○二三年二月推出「防騙視伏App」至今，累計的下載次數、向用戶發出的可疑來電警示，以及要求電訊商攔截的本地和非本地可疑電話號碼數目分別為何；對於該等可疑及被攔截的電話號碼，警方的後續跟進詳情及結果為何；及

（六）有否全面檢視政府推出的各項打擊電話騙案措施的成效；若有，結果為何，以及有何措施應對電話騙案數目未見減少的情況，包括會否調整現有打擊電話騙案的整體策略、推出相關的優化措施及新措施等？

答覆：

主席：

通訊事務管理局辦公室（通訊辦）一直從電訊服務的角度制定並實施一系列源頭防範措施，以配合香港警務處加強打擊電話詐騙。就邱達根議員的提問，經諮詢保安局、通訊辦及警方後，現綜合回覆如下：

電話智能卡實名登記制（實名登記制）於二○二三年二月起全面實施，規定所有在本地發出及使用的電話智能卡（包括上台月費服務和電話儲值卡）均須於啓動服務前完成實名登記。在實名登記制下，通訊辦已要求電訊商定期抽查已登記的電話卡資料及加強核查懷疑個案，並將涉嫌違法個案交予警方處理。被抽查的用戶如未能按所屬電訊商指示核實登記資料，有關電話儲值卡會被取消登記而不能繼續使用。截至今年四月底，約471萬張電話儲值卡因客戶未能提供合乎登記要求的資料（包括以身分證明文件副本進行登記及填寫的資料與身分證明文件不一致等）而被拒絕登記，另外有約340萬張未能遵從合規要求的電話儲值卡（包括在電訊商進行抽查時未能按照要求進行身分核實及懷疑使用偽冒證件進行登記等）被取消登記。根據電訊商提供的資料，大部分取消登記的原因是由於相關用戶未按要求提交登記用的身分證明文件作核實。通訊辦並沒有備存相關取消登記原因的分項資料。

為加強實名登記制的有效實施，通訊辦亦已要求電訊商以「智方便」作為香港身份證持有人在實名登記制下的預設登記方式，而非持有香港身份證人士的實名登記資料亦會進行人手核查。現時，在實名登記制下提供虛假資料及／或虛假文件，或會構成刑事罪行。通訊辦並沒有備存已登記電話儲值卡市場轉售的資料。

另外，警方於二○二三年二月推出手機應用程式「防騙視伏App」，協助市民分辨可疑網上平台帳戶、收款帳戶、電話號碼、電郵地址及網址等，並提供防騙提示。截至今年四月底，「防騙視伏App」已錄得逾96萬次下載，搜尋器已錄得840萬次搜尋，向市民作出100萬次預警。現時「防騙視伏App」已經升級至備有自動偵測功能，應用程式內可疑來電警示及可疑網站偵測的功能會自動辨識詐騙來電和詐騙網站，如發現潛在詐騙或網絡安全風險，會即時發出通知，提醒用戶不要接聽或瀏覽。截至今年四月底，「防騙視伏App」已透過自動功能向市民發出逾80萬次可疑來電及網站警示。在通訊辦的協調下，警方及主要電訊商已建立機制，電訊商會根據警方提供的詐騙紀錄盡快攔截涉嫌進行詐騙的電話號碼及可疑網頁連結。截至今年四月底，已有超過50 000個網頁連結及約9 000個本地及非本地電話號碼被攔截。警方亦會積極調查與這些涉嫌詐騙的電話號碼相關的案件。

除了上述措施，通訊辦亦要求電訊商攔截以「+852」為開首的可疑來電、就其他以「+852」開首的境外來電向所有流動用戶發送話音提示或文字訊息、就新啓動流動電話儲值卡播放提示，以及推行「短訊發送人登記制」以協助市民識別短訊發送人的身分。通訊辦亦有持續進行市場巡查及加強公眾宣傳活動，並在今年一月推出防電騙地區大使計劃，委任超過300位區議員及其議員辦事處人員參與出任防電騙地區大使，並自今年五月起聯同防電騙地區大使透過地區活動進一步加強宣傳有關防電騙的訊息。

就電話騙案趨勢方面，警方於今年一至四月期間共接獲1816宗電話騙案，每月平均為454宗，比二○二四年第四季的每月平均（即951宗）大幅下跌52.3%，所涉及損失約3.2億港元，涉及共1759名受害人，年齡介乎15歲至97歲。就去年初開始出現的假冒客服電話騙案，經警方的重點打擊，今年首四個月的月平均數，較去年七月高峰的約1110宗下跌至約190宗，跌幅超過八成。有關騙案趨勢可見政府打擊電話騙案的成效。

政府會繼續多管齊下打擊電話騙案，以保障市民利益。就打擊電話詐騙的措施及實名登記制，政府正參考有關實施的整體經驗，以及警方提供有關犯罪集團使用電話儲值卡的騙案趨勢等資料，檢視有關措施的成效及實名登記制的整體運作，包括審視電話儲值卡數目上限、禁止轉售已實名登記的電話智能卡或利用他人資料牟利進行實名登記的安排等，並計劃於今年諮詢立法會相關事務委員會的意見。"

LCQ7: Measures to combat telephone fraud,2025-06-18 15:30,2025-06-18 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/18/P2025061800498.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Duncan Chiu and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Dr Bernard Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 18):

Question:

  In recent years, the HKSAR Government has adopted diversified measures to actively combat telephone fraud, including introducing the Real-name Registration Programme for Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) Cards (RNR Programme) and the Hong Kong Police Force's ""Scameter+"" and requiring local telecommunications service providers (TSPs) to play a voice alert message for calls made from newly activated pre-paid SIM (PPS) cards and block suspicious calls, as well as strengthening co-operation with Mainland and international law enforcement agencies. However, there are views pointing out that local telephone fraud cases have not shown a decreasing trend, causing inconvenience and disturbance to the public in their daily lives. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of telephone fraud cases received by the Police from January to May this year, as well as the amount of money involved in such cases, the number of victims and their age distribution;

(2) of the total number of PPS cards which have been rejected as the clients failed to provide information in compliance with the registration requirements since the introduction of the RNR Programme; the total number of the registration records of non-compliant PPS cards which have been cancelled by the TSPs, together with a breakdown and percentage by reason for non-compliance;

(3) whether it has estimated the number of registered PPS cards resold in the market under the RNR Programme; of the authorities' countermeasures currently in place against the resale practice concerned, and how they follow up cases of members of the public purchasing and using PPS cards that have long been registered by other persons;

(4) as the 2024 Policy Address has mentioned that the Government would introduce a legislative amendment proposal into this Council to prohibit the resale of registered SIM cards with a view to further enhancing the RNR Programme, of the latest progress of such work and the legislative timetable;

(5) of the accumulated downloads of ""Scameter+"" since its launch by the Police in February 2023 and the respective numbers of call alerts issued to users and local and non-local suspicious telephone numbers which the TSPs have been required to block; of the details and outcome of the Police's follow-up actions in respect of such suspicious and blocked telephone numbers; and

(6) whether it has comprehensively reviewed the effectiveness of the various measures introduced by the Government to combat telephone fraud; if so, of the results, and the measures in place to cope with the situation where the number of telephone fraud cases has not decreased, including whether it will adjust the existing overall strategy for combating telephone fraud, as well as introduce relevant enhancement measures and new measures?

Reply:

President,

  The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) has been devising and implementing a series of preventive measures from the perspective of telecommunications services to assist the Hong Kong Police Force (Police) in combating phone deception at the source. In response to the question raised by the Hon Duncan Chiu, having consulted the Security Bureau, OFCA and the Police, our consolidated reply is as follows:

  The Real-name Registration Programme for SIM Cards (RNR Programme) has been fully implemented since February 2023, requiring that all SIM cards issued and used locally (including SIM service plans and pre-paid SIM cards (PPS cards)) must complete real-name registration before service activation.Under the RNR Programme, OFCA has requested telecommunications service providers (TSPs) to conduct regular sampling checks on registered SIM card information, to step up verification of suspicious cases, and to refer cases suspected of violating the law to the Police for handling. If the users subject to sample checks are unable to verify their registered information in accordance with the instructions of the respective TSPs, the relevant PPS cards will be deregistered and cannot be used thereafter. As at end-April this year, around 4.71 million PPS cards were rejected for registration as the clients failed to provide information in compliance with the registration requirements (including cases where registration was done using a copy of an identity document and the information provided was inconsistent with the identity document, etc). Besides, the registration records of about 3.4million non-compliant PPS cards have been deregistered (including cases where users failed to verify their identities as required during the TSPs' sampling checks and were suspected of using forged documents for registration, etc). According to the information provided by the TSPs, the majority of deregistration was due to users failing to submit required identity documents for verification as required. OFCA does not maintain information on specific reasons for deregistration by breakdown.

  To enhance the effective implementation of the RNR Programme, OFCA has required the TSPs to adopt ""iAM Smart"" as the default registration method for Hong Kong identity card (HKID) holders. For non-HKID holders, their real-name registration information will be manually verified. Currently, provision of false information and/or false documents under the RNR Programme may constitute a criminal offence. OFCA does not maintain information on the resale of registered PPS cards in the market.

  In addition, the Police launched the mobile application ""Scameter+"" in February 2023 to help members of the public distinguish suspicious online platform accounts, payment accounts, phone numbers, email addresses, websites, etc, and to provide the public with anti-fraud tips. As at end-April this year, ""Scameter+"" had recorded over 960000 downloads, 8.4 million searches in its search engine and 1 million alerts issued to members of the public. ""Scameter+"" has now been upgraded and is equipped with automatic detection functions. The Call Alert function and the Website Detection function within the mobile application will automatically identify scam calls and fraudulent websites. If potential fraud or cyber security risk is detected, ""Scameter+"" will issue a real-time notification, reminding users not to answer the call or browse the website. As at end-April this year, ""Scameter+"" had issued over 800000 warnings about suspicious calls and websites to the public through its automatic function. Under OFCA's co-ordination, the Police and major TSPs have established a mechanism where the TSPs will, based on the fraud records provided by the Police, block the telephone numbers suspected to be involved in deception cases and intercept suspicious website links as soon as possible. As at end-April this year, more than 50000 website links and about 9000 local and non-local phone numbers have been successfully blocked. The Police will also actively investigate cases related to these suspected scam phone numbers.

  Apart from the above-mentioned measures, OFCA has also required the TSPs to intercept suspicious calls starting with ""+852"", send voice alerts or text messages to all mobile users for overseas calls prefixed with ""+852"", and play voice alerts for newly activated PPS cards, as well as has launched the SMS Sender Registration Scheme to assist members of public in distinguishing the identity of the SMS senders. OFCA has also been conducting continuous market surveillance and strengthening publicity activities, as well as has launched the District Anti-Phone Deception Ambassador Scheme in January this year, appointing over300District Council members and staff members of their ward offices as District Anti-Phone Deception Ambassadors. Starting from May this year, OFCA has collaborated with District Anti-Phone Deception Ambassadors through community activities to further promote anti-scam messages.

  For telephone deception trends, the Police recorded a total of 1816telephone deception cases between January and April this year, averaging 454 cases per month and representing a significant 52.3 per cent decrease compared to the monthly average of 951 cases in the fourth quarter of 2024. The financial losses associated amounted to approximately HK$320 million, involving a total of 1759victims aged between 15 and 97. For telephone deception cases involving impersonation of customer service emerged since early last year, after focused enforcement efforts by the Police, the monthly average for the first four months this year dropped to approximately 190 cases, recording a decrease of over 80 per cent from the peak of about 1110 cases in July 2024. These trends highlight the effectiveness of measures implemented by the Government in combating phone deception.

  The Government will continue to adopt a multi-pronged approach to combat phone deception and protect the interests of the public. Regarding anti-phone deception measures and the RNR Programme, with reference to the overall implementation experience and the Police's provision of scam trends on criminal groups using PPS cards, the Government is reviewing the implementation effectiveness of relevant measures and overall operation of the RNR Programme, including reviewing the limit on the number of PPS cards, the arrangement for prohibiting the sale of registered SIM cards or using information of others to conduct real-name registration for profit making, etc. The Government aims to consult relevant Legislative Council Panel within this year."
