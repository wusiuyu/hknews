"Speech by SCST at opening ceremony of City University of Hong Kong's ""City Quest"" programme (English only)",2025-07-12 13:08,2025-07-12 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071200377.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the opening ceremony of City University of Hong Kong's ""City Quest"" programme today (July 12):

Chairman Ngai (Council Chairman of City University of Hong Kong (CityU), Mr Michael Ngai), å±ç¸½ (Vice President and Chairman of the Group Technology Committee, Xiaomi Corporation, Mr Qu Heng), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to be in the CityU today for the opening ceremony of the ""City Quest å°‍åè¨"" programme.

Today, we gather here to mark the official launch of a visionary community engagement programme that embodies the spirit of ""tourism is everywhere"",ãé¦æ¸¯ç¡èä¸æéã. I was particularly impressed that this programme is inviting every member of the public to become a storyteller of our city through the ""hands"" by sharing personal narratives about Hong Kong, through the ""feet"" by becoming docent ambassadors and through the ""eyes"" by capturing the beauty of Hong Kong. This resonates with what I have been advocating ever since assuming the post as Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, which is ""Everyone is a tourism ambassador"", ãäººäººé½æ¯æéå¤§ä½¿ã.

With the travel patterns and traveller preferences progressing into more in-depth explorations, the Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, as led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, with myself as Deputy Leader, has recently announced nine hotspot projects to offer new and more in-depth tourist experiences, with one project in Old Town Central and the other in Kowloon City. The Old Town Central project will take the Central to Mid-Levels Escalator as a conduit connecting various offerings in the vicinity to guide visitors to explore the beauty of our alleys and streets. On the other hand, the Kowloon City project features the ""Kowloon Walled City: A Cinematic Journey"" Movie Set Exhibition as the starting point to extend visitors' experience further in the district. Through these projects, we encourage visitors to experience Hong Kong's authentic local flavour from widened perspectives. I am confident that the ""City Quest"" programme will complement our hotspot projects to curate more fascinating experiences to a wider audience, thereby bringing more visitors to the unique beauty of Hong Kong.

Hong Kong is an international tourist city with significant advantages in developing city walk routes, with our diverse gourmet food, high accessibility and efficient transportation system. I wish the ""City Quest å°å‍è¨"" programme a success and would love to see more efforts of this kind from different stakeholders in the community in promoting the Hong Kong neighbourhoods.

Before I close, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to City University of Hong Kong and its partners for organising this meaningful programme to promote Hong Kong from fresh perspectives. Thank you very much."
Speech by CS at Student of the Year Awards 2024/25 Presentation Ceremony (English only) (with photos),2025-07-12 12:47,2025-07-12 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071200358.htm,"Following is the speech by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, at the Student of the Year Awards 2024/25 Presentation Ceremony today (July 12):

Catherine (Chief Executive Officer of the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Ms Catherine So), Dr Lake Wang (Executive Director, People and Organisational Development of the Hong Kong Jockey Club), Tammy (Editor-in-Chief of the South China Morning Post, Ms Tammy Tam), Advisory Board members, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. And what a great morning this is for Hong Kong. Today, we celebrate our secondary schools and the exceptional professionalism and dedication of principals, teachers and support staff. We also thank parents for their endless support. And, most importantly, we honour the students among us today - the winners and finalists of this 44th annual Student of the Year Awards.

This year, over 840 students from 177 schools were nominated. And that, I'm delighted to say, is a new record high for the Awards.

Rewarding excellence is no easy task, yet Hong Kong is fortunate to have so many deserving students.

The judging panel had the tough task of bringing all those impressive nominations down to 40 finalists for the Awards' 10 student categories, including the Grand Prize.

The Government is firmly committed to youth development.

The Youth Development Blueprint for Hong Kong, released in late 2022, outlines our guiding principles for promoting long-term youth development. Its original 160-plus measures have been expanded, since then, to about 250, in an ongoing effort to ensure that the Blueprint evolves to meet the changing needs of our youth.

Our vision is to raise a new generation of youth instilled with a global perspective, a positive mindset and a deep love for our city and our country.

That demands a community-wide effort, including valued partnerships with organisations like the SCMP and the Jockey Club, working closely with educational institutions and families, to create an enabling environment for the youth of Hong Kong.

This year's theme, ""Building Tomorrow: Growth Through Action"", reflects that shared vision.

My congratulations to each and every one of this year's awardees and finalists. Remember, this city, together with your proud parents, your school, teachers and mentors, and so many others who have helped you along the way, believe in you and look forward to your future with great expectations.

I am grateful to the South China Morning Post and the Hong Kong Jockey Club for organising this prestigious event year after year and, in doing so, putting a brilliant spotlight on education, our youth and Hong Kong.

My thanks, too, to the Awards' judges, nearly 40 in all, for their invaluable time and expertise, and their compelling commitment to excellence.

Ladies and gentlemen, I know you will all enjoy this memorable day in the life.

Thank you."
醫務衞生局局長在南京出席第十三屆南京肝膽外科肝移植學術研討會（附圖）,2025-07-12 12:04,2025-07-12 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071100682.htm,"醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（七月十二日）出席於南京舉行的第十三屆南京肝膽外科肝移植學術研討會，與來自世界各地的肝移植專家分享香港在器官移植方面的最新發展和香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）與內地在器官捐贈及移植方面的合作。

盧寵茂教授在開幕式上致辭時說︰「香港和內地肝膽外科領域的合作由來已久，我亦親身見證了兩地專家攜手完成多例複雜肝移植手術、實現技術和資源的深度融合，這正好是『一國兩制』框架下醫療合作的良好示範。近年，香港與內地在器官捐贈與移植方面也有突破。二○二二年十二月及今年二月，兩例跨境心臟捐贈成功挽救兩名嬰兒的生命，充分體現內地與香港血濃於水、共同以生命至上的原則和信念拯救生命。隨着經驗累積，香港與內地有關緊急請求器官移植的渠道和流程已理順和規範化，特區政府會繼續探索將機制恆常化的安排。」

他亦分享香港防治肝病方面的最新情況。他說︰「自一九八八年開始，香港為所有新生嬰兒接種乙肝疫苗，大幅降低年青一代的感染率。行政長官在去年公布的《施政報告》中亦提出推行乙肝篩查以防治肝癌，若能及早識別患者，將有利於『早發現、早治療』，以減低患上併發症，包括肝硬化和肝癌的風險。」

研討會由江蘇省抗癌協會、江蘇省醫師協會和江蘇省醫學會聯合舉辦。會議雲集國際肝病專家和學者，以及來自世界各地的高級衞生官員。

盧寵茂教授隨後到江蘇省人民醫院（南京醫科大學第一附屬醫院）參觀，以及與該院院長劉雲教授交流和分享提升醫院管理和服務的經驗。他表示︰「醫院管理局（醫管局）正採納由深圳市衞健醫院評審評價研究中心制定的《國際醫院評審認證標準（中國）》（2021版）（《國際標準》），於轄下的公營醫院重啓醫院認證計劃，透過獨立的醫院認證專業機構，客觀地評估醫院在各方面的表現，藉此提升醫療機構的質素和保障病人安全。此外，醫管局亦按照國家認證標準於屯門醫院建設首間中風中心，以及分別於瑪麗醫院和威爾斯親王醫院建設胸痛中心，以優化相關的專科診症流程，改善治療效果，從而提升病人存活率。」

盧寵茂教授補充：「特區政府未來會繼續積極推動《國際標準》評審認證計劃以及胸痛中心和中風中心的建立，有關工作不單有助粵港澳大灣區醫療融合，令香港融入國家發展大局，亦能充分發揮香港『背靠祖國、聯通世界』的優勢，向國際社會展示國家醫院評審認證標準的卓越性。」

衞生署助理署長（藥物）陳凌峯、醫管局質素及安全總監黃立己醫生和港島西醫院聯網總監李德麗醫生陪同盧寵茂教授出席今日的活動。他們將於今日下午返港。"
Secretary for Health attends 13th Nanjing Academic Symposium on Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation in Nanjing (with photos),2025-07-12 12:04,2025-07-12 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071100679.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor LoChung-mau,attended the 13th Nanjing Academic Symposium on Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation in Nanjing today (July 12) to share with liver transplant experts from around the world Hong Kong's latest developments in organ transplantation, and the work of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in co-operation with the Mainland on organ donation and transplantation.

  In his address at the opening ceremony, Professor Lo said, ""Hong Kong and the Mainland have a long-standing collaboration in hepatobiliary surgery. I have personally witnessed experts from both places jointly performing a number of complex liver transplant surgeries, achieving in-depth integration of technology and resources, which is an exemplary model of medical co-operation under the 'one country, two systems' framework. In recent years, Hong Kong and the Mainland have also made breakthroughs in organ donation and transplantation. In December 2022 and February this year, two cases of cross-boundary heart donation successfully saved the lives of two infants, exemplifying to the fullest the inseparable ties between the Mainland and Hong Kong as well as our shared principle and mission in protecting and saving lives. With the accumulation of experience, the channels and procedures for handling urgent cross-boundary organ transplant requests have now been streamlined and standardised. The HKSAR Government will continue to explore arrangements for regularising this mechanism.""

  He also shared the latest developments in the prevention and control of liver disease in Hong Kong. He said, ""Since 1988, Hong Kong has provided universal hepatitis B vaccination for all newborns, significantly reducing infection rates among younger generations. As outlined in last year's Policy Address, the Chief Executive also proposed to implement hepatitis B screening to prevent liver cancer. If patients can be identified at an early stage, it will facilitate 'early identification and early treatment', thereby effectively reducing risks of developing complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer.""

  The conference was jointly organised by the Jiangsu Anti-cancer Association, the Jiangsu Medical Doctor Association, and the Jiangsu Medical Association. The conference brought together international experts and scholars in liver disease, as well as senior health officials from around the world.

  Professor Lo then visited the Jiangsu Province Hospital (the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University), where he exchanged views and shared experiences on enhancing hospital management and services with the President of Jiangsu Province Hospital (the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University), Professor Liu Yun. He said, ""The Hospital Authority (HA) is adopting China's International Hospital Accreditation Standards (2021 Version) developed by the Shenzhen Hospital Accreditation Research Centre to resume the hospital accreditation programme at its public hospitals. Through independent professional hospital accreditation organisations, various aspects of hospital performance are assessed in an objective manner, with a view to enhancing the quality of healthcare institutions and safeguarding patient safety. Moreover, the HA seeks to optimise the diagnosis process of the relevant specialties and improve the treatment outcomes through the establishment of the first stroke centre at Tuen Mun Hospital, as well as chest pain centres at both Queen Mary Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital in accordance with national accreditation standards, thereby enhancing the survival rate of patients.""

  Professor Lo added, ""The HKSAR Government will continue to promote the accreditation programme under the Standards as well as the establishment of chest pain centres and stroke centres. These initiatives will not only improve healthcare integration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and support Hong Kong's integration into national development, but also leverage Hong Kong's advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, so as to demonstrate the excellence of the national hospital accreditation standards to the international community.""

  The Assistant Director of Health (Drug), Mr Frank Chan; the Director (Quality and Safety) of the HA, Dr Michael Wong, and the Cluster Chief Executive of Hong Kong West Cluster of the HA, Dr Theresa Li, accompanied Professor Lo to attend today's functions. They will return to Hong Kong this afternoon."

  Mr Lee said, ""This is the first meeting for the new term (second term) of CECA members. I warmly welcomed the three new members of the CECA, namely Dr Zhu Min, who served as the Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund and the Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, along with two enterprises of Hangzhou's ""Six Little Dragons"" - the founder of BrainCo, Mr Han Bi-cheng, and the founder of Unitree Robotics, Mr Wang Xing-xing, for attending the meetings in Hong Kong. During the meeting, they emphasised that Hong Kong is bestowed with its unique advantages of connecting with both the Mainland and the world, excellent education and research capabilities, and advantageous geographical location, and it is also an international financial centre with free flow of capital. These advantages would greatly attract Mainland enterprises to list in Hong Kong and use Hong Kong as the gateway to go global. ""

  The CECA conducted in-depth discussions on a range of important issues under three major themes:


Economic advancement and sustainability – including how to consolidate Hong Kong's position as the international financial, shipping and trade centres amid geopolitical changes and economic restructuring.
Innovation and entrepreneurship – including how to promote the upgrading and transformation of traditional industries, proactively nurture emerging industries, expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, and proactively attract capital and talents to assist in the development of innovation and technology in Hong Kong.
Regional and global collaborations – including how to leverage the opportunities of our motherland and deepen international exchanges and co-operation, strengthen ties with countries along the Belt and Road and explore emerging markets such as the Middle East, the ASEAN, South America, and Central Asia in order to seek new opportunities, and to provide high quality professional services to Mainland and international enterprises, amid an everâchanging geopolitical landscape and constantly increasing uncertainties.


  Mr Lee said members of the Council are all distinguished and eminent leaders in their respective fields or internationally renowned scholars, experts or entrepreneurs. He thanks all members for actively providing him with valuable insights and wise counsel regarding the current situation and vision for future developments of Hong Kong. These contributions have provided important references for the overall development strategies of Hong Kong and the upcoming Policy Address.

 The three meeting sessions were chaired by the Chief Executive.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""The US has blatantly and repeatedly breached the international law and the basic norms underpinning international relations, andvainlyinterfered with the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong matters by extending again the so-called 'national emergency with respect to Hong Kong'. Such act is arbitrary and unreasonable. The US has time and again made skewed remarks about Hong Kong's situation and imposedtheso-called 'sanctions' on Hong Kong, attempting to interfere with Hong Kong's law-based governance and undermine the city's rule of law as well as its prosperity and stability. Their despicable plots are doomed to fail.

""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. No country will watch with folded armsonacts and activities that endanger national security. With at least 21 pieces of lawssafeguarding national securityin the US, the US exposed theirdouble standardsas theypointed fingers at the HKSAR's legal system and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, whiletotally disregarding the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development andtheprotection of human rights.""

The Department of Justice of the HKSAR is in charge of criminal prosecutions under Article 63 of the Basic Law, with all its prosecutorial decisions made on an objective analysis of all admissible evidence and applicable laws. Everyone charged with a criminal offence will receive fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong (including theHKNSL andtheSafeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO)) and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.""

""Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city havebeen robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The legal framework in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR is in line with relevant international human rights standards. TheHKNSL and the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to the HKSAR are protected in accordance with the law.""

The spokesman reiterated,""The HKSAR Government will, as always, resolutely, fully and faithfully implement theHKNSL, the SNSO and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, whilst upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'.

發展局局長就二○二五年七月至九月季度賣地計劃會見傳媒談話內容（附短片）,2025-07-11 20:30,2025-07-11 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100639.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（七月十一日）就二○二五年七月至九月季度賣地計劃會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：之前政府賣地都試過流標，今次是否擔心有流標的風險？如何看現時整體市況？

發展局局長：首先大家都見到，我們近幾個季度推售的土地，都是揀選一些規模不是太大，都是位處一些成熟社區，亦都不會有太複雜的土地平整或其他工程的需求。過去幾個季度，無論在大圍或再早前在小瀝源都有些土地成功售出，所以對於今個季度，剛才我提到荃灣這幅土地，我們都是持樂觀態度。至於你第二個問題，說到現時樓市的情況，雖然我們做土地供應，我時常都說，不可以只看當前樓市的情況。不過如果我們看數據，最近這幾個月，似乎私人房地產市場亦都慢慢向上。如果大家看我們拿去土地註冊處註冊的土地交易個案，亦有上升趨勢，租務市場亦很堅穩，所以我們覺得，似乎我們的房地產市場，現時慢慢都有向好的表現。

記者：北都那三個片區，之前都說過最快下半年就會推出招標。其實現時有沒有初步的標書條款可以分享一下？另外，今個月底截標的元朗及洪水橋／厦村的多層產業大樓，目前的環境是怎樣，會否因為市況而延期，以及條款有沒有更新？

發展局局長：兩個問題，第一個是關於我們在北部都會區三個試點的片區，我們仍然爭取在今年內，相信會是接近年底時，即第四季，我們希望可以推出起碼一幅來招標。我相信首兩幅應該都會是在洪水橋和粉嶺北那兩幅，因為新田科技城的片區我們尚未完成徵地工作。

你剛才問到我們第一、二幅如果今年推出，招標的條款是甚麼，現時我未能跟大家講到一些具體細節，因為我們仍在分析收回來的意向書，稍後我們可能還需要跟市場有一些溝通。但我相信都會很快，現時已經是七月，一踏入第四季，當我們真的招標，招標前都會有一些公布。

剛才你第二個問題問到，我們有兩幅多層產業大樓的用地在元朗和洪水橋。這幅用地如果大家記得，對於政府來說，我們都是初試啼聲，因為我們第一次拿土地出來興建產業大樓，也有所要求，希望部分樓面，兩成至三成不等，在建成後有一段期間租給政府，以幫助受發展影響的棕地作業。這對我們來說是一個新嘗試。過去一段時間，其實我們先後做過市場的意向徵集，也有正面的回應，亦因應市場給予的一些意見，我們有一、兩次都調整了招標條款，亦將截標時間延後，所以經過這些調整，我們當然希望市場有積極回應，但因為始終距今我們截標的時間很短，我不太適宜在此作一些估算，以免影響市場運作。

記者：關於今季推出的荃灣地皮，剛才提到有少量樓面是GIC設施，其實是哪類型設施？以往推地，有些地因為有GIC設施，可能影響最後招標反應，你會否擔心這幅地有這個情況？這幅地在賣地表的地皮來說，單位數目較多，有七百多個單位，局長剛才提到市況慢慢向上，是否因為市況轉好而推出較大幅的地皮，現時是否一個較合適時間考慮一些較大幅的地皮，將來可再推出招標。另外，有一幅洪水橋地皮完成換地，是今季土地供應的主要來源，另外五幅補地價地皮是否都是來自北都？早前說洪水橋地皮的住宅樓面可再考慮，現時進展如何？

發展局局長：首先第一個問題，我們推售的這幅荃灣住宅用地，的確要求有少量樓面做社福設施。我剛才提到，其實樓面相對少，940平方米，相對於作住宅樓面的39 000平方米，是相當少量。而具體的社福設施，應該包括一個社工服務隊，有時照顧長者需要一個服務隊，有一個基地，這個社工服務隊的辦公樓面，另外亦有一個特殊幼兒中心，但我強調兩個設施加起來其實都是很少量，我相信對這幅地的吸引力不會有影響，它本身有正面的吸引力。

至於你剛才問到，這幅地皮可提供大約780個單位，相信算是大的。其實今年我們有甚麼土地放在賣地表，大家都看到，在市區、成熟社區用地有好幾幅，這一幅我們近日完成改劃，仍有幾幅的改劃工作進行中，因為未完成程序，所以難以在今季考慮推出。隨着市況，我們一直會留意，會選擇合適土地在接下來幾季推出。你剛才問到洪水橋今季有一幅原址換地成功了並已計入。在洪水橋這個地方，仍有其他換地申請正在處理中，主要涉及一些商業用地，我們早前將截止完成日期延後至今年年尾，因為想給予我們一些時間檢視那幾幅商業用地，是否需要容許其改變少許用途，讓其增加住宅樓面，我們的檢視工作進行當中。

你亦問到今季有六個完成地契修訂項目，除了剛才提及一個洪水橋項目外，還有一個在九龍區發祥街，之前是倉儲用地；另外一個在元朗，應該涉及農地；再另外三個是一些很小型，在市區、九龍區的用地。但我今天不會談細節，因為大家都知道地契修訂完成後——現時仍有些手續——完成後，我們會在土地註冊處和地政總署有一個整全公布。

記者：今年上半年，你說供應量達標百分之四十五，你估計全年會否都有信心達標？近期拆息回落，還有很多利好樓市的因素，但見到政府近期可能只推出一些中小型或者一幅單數住宅地，以現時去看，你認為未來的趨勢，政府是否傾向這樣試水溫，還是也有條件可以多推一些土地或者較大幅的地皮？另外，近期樓市有好轉，你對地價前景有何看法？

發展局局長：首先，有沒有信心達標，我們每年定一個目標，都希望朝着那個目標進發，但始終我們每一季推多少地，推哪些地都的確要看市場走勢和經濟情況。現階段來看，我認為應該都是平穩的，因為去到年度中間，我們大約做到百分之四十五。所以，如果這個趨勢繼續，我認為情況是審慎樂觀的。你第二個問題與剛才另一個問題有點相似，我們慢慢會不會再推出較大型或者一季多推一幅土地，我們都會看情況而行，我現在不排除這個可能性。至於地價方面，我們任何時候都說，政府賣地會有個底價，而我們的底價必定要與市場狀況有所配合。所以，現階段我較難估計全年地價收入，因為有一點值得大家留意，地價收入不只看賣地，當然還有很多地契修訂的補地價，以及有一些豁免書申請，即如在農地建構一些構築物都要支付豁免費用，這些加起來才會組成地價，所以在這裏，我認為不太適宜做一個揣測。

Government announces quarterly land sale programme for July to September 2025,2025-07-11 20:11,2025-07-11 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100692.htm,"The Government announced today (July 11) the quarterly land sale programme for the second quarter of 2025-26, i.e. July to September 2025.

The Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, said in the second quarter of 2025-26, the Government will put up for tender a residential site at the junction of Wing Shun Street and Texaco Road, Tsuen Wan. The site is able to provide floor space of around 39 000 square metres and can provide about 780 flats. It is selected from the Annual Land Sale List announced in February this year and situates in a mature neighbourhood with comprehensive surrounding facilities and traffic network. The rezoning procedures for the site from ""Government, Institution and Community"" use to ""Residential"" use have recently completed.

Furthermore, residential land supply this quarter will also stem from private development and redevelopment projects requiring lease modification, of which six cases are expected to complete the land administration procedures in the second quarter, providing a total supply of around 4 170 flats. These cases include a land exchange case at Hung Shui Kiu Area 34B under the Enhanced Conventional New Town Approach and earlier announced by the Development Bureau (2 300 flats). The project situates in an area of high development potential in the Northern Metropolis and would foster the development of the area along with the planning of Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area. It is worth noting that as at the second quarter of this financial year, the land supply from this source has exceeded the full-year estimation in the beginning of the year, reflecting increasing activities in the market.

Ms Linn said that, taking into account the site to be put up for tender by the Government and the six cases of lease modification, the total private housing land supply in the second quarter of this financial year would support the development of around 4 950 units. Together with the supply from the first quarter, the total private housing land supply of the first half of this financial year is expected to support some 6 000 units, which is around 45 per cent of the annual target of private housing supply. This figure has not yet reflected private development projects not requiring lease modification from the second quarter, as such figures are only available at a later stage. The Government considers the land supply for this financial year reasonable, and expects to maintain stable land supply in this year.

As regards the private housing land supply for 2024-25, taking into account private development and redevelopment projects not requiring lease modification captured in the fourth quarter, the actual supply is adjusted upwards to around 10 030 flats, which is around 75 per cent of the supply target.

The Government will continue to sustain our effort in rolling out land in a prudent and pragmatic manner, and flexibly adjust our land disposal strategy according to market situation, in order to meet the development needs of society.

The list of the site to be tendered in July to September 2025 is in the Annex. The actual tender timetable will be drawn up taking into account the progress of necessary preparatory work. The Lands Department will announce the detailed land sale arrangements before the site are put up for tender."
政府公布二○二五年七月至九月季度賣地計劃,2025-07-11 20:10,2025-07-11 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100691.htm,"政府今日（七月十一日）公布二○二五至二六年度第二季度（即二○二五年七月至九月）的賣地計劃。

發展局局長甯漢豪表示，二○二五至二六年度第二季度，政府會以招標方式出售一幅位於荃灣永順街與德士古道交界的住宅用地。用地樓面面積約39 000平方米，可提供約780個單位。用地選自本年二月公布的年度賣地表上，位於成熟社區，周邊配套齊全，交通網絡完善。用地的規劃程序早前完成，由「政府、機構及社區」改劃為「住宅」用途。

另外，今季其他住宅用地來源包括需要進行地契修訂的私人發展及重建項目，暫時預計有六個項目有望於第二季完成土地行政手續，合共可提供約4 170個單位。其中包括發展局早前公布的洪水橋34B區「加強版傳統新市鎮發展模式」下的一宗換地個案（2 300個單位），該項目位處北部都會區發展潛力極高的區域，配合洪水橋╱厦村新發展區的規劃，將可促進區內發展。值得留意的是，本年度截至第二季來自此來源的項目已超過年初全年估算，反映市場活動有上升趨勢。

甯漢豪表示，綜合政府推售一幅土地及六宗地契修訂個案，本年度第二季的私人房屋土地供應預計可支持興建約4 950個單位。連同第一季的供應，本年度上半年的私人房屋土地供應，預計合共可提供約6 000個單位，是本年度供應目標的百分之四十五。這個數字尚未反映第二季度來自無須修訂地契的私人發展個案供應，因為這類數字一般要較後才有統計。政府認為本年度供應至今尚算理想，預計全年能維持平穩的土地供應。」

至於二○二四至二五年度的私人房屋土地供應，計及第四季度無須修訂地契的私人發展及重建項目，該年度的實際供應調高至約10 030個單位，為供應目標約七成半。

政府會繼續審時度勢、有節有度及務實地向市場推出土地，並會因應市況靈活調整推地策略，以照顧社會發展的需要。

二○二五年七月至九月招標的政府用地資料載於附件。實際招標時間表視乎所需籌備工作的進度，地政總署將於用地招標前公布出售用地的詳細安排。"

By referring the payment dispute to adjudication, an adjudicator, as an independent third party, will determine the payment dispute and the costs of adjudication proceedings payable by each party. To protect the interests of parties to adjudication, and ensure that the adjudication determination can be effectively enforced, the Ordinance allows parties to adjudication, under specific circumstances, apply to the Court for set aside or enforcement of the relevant determination. Under the Ordinance, both the Court of First Instance and the District Court have jurisdictions to hear set aside applications and enforcement applications.

  ""The Ordinance was gazetted on December 27, 2024, and will come into full operation on August 28 this year, with great support from the industry for the upcoming implementation of adjudication provisions under the Ordinance. The Rules provide for the practice and procedure relating to set aside applications and enforcement applications, to facilitate effective handling of relevant applications in the Court, ensuring that adjudication determinations are upheld swiftly and providing parties to adjudication with legal certainty. The formulation of the Rules has taken full account of the views of legal profession, construction industry stakeholders and the Judiciary,"" a spokesman for the Development Bureau said.

ããThe Rules will be tabled at the Legislative Council on July 16 for negative vetting. Subject to the completion of the necessary legislative process, the Rules will come into effect on September 5 this year."

This event brings together energetic young innovation and technology (I&T) talents at the Hong Kong Science Park, and I am thrilled to be part of it.

  This year, we celebrate a remarkable milestone - the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong Techathon+. Over the past decade, this platform has transformed into a vibrant and dynamic launch pad for young innovators and entrepreneurs. Since its inception in 2015 as a collaboration between Hong Kong Science Park and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong Techathon+ has gathered thousands of young talents to transform bold and creative ideas into potential start-ups. Today, we are proud to see the initiative expanded to include 15 higher education institutions in Hong Kong, along with over 30 partnering institutions and organisations from across the Mainland, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia and the United States. Notable global partners like Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford and NUS (National University of Singapore), have lent their strength to this journey, making Techathon+ not just local, but a truly international event.

  Over the years, Hong Kong Techathon+ has welcomed over 7 000 participants and 2 000 start-up projects. It is inspiring to see that some alumni have achieved remarkable success, including recognition in Forbes Asia's 30 Under 30 list. We are excited to have many of them back to celebrate this milestone with us.

  Riding on the success of Techathon+, Hong Kong Science Park, together with the 15 local co-organising institutions, has initiated the GUIN to promote Hong Kong's leading position as a hub of research and academic excellence. This powerful network connects local and international universities, fostering multilateral collaborations in talent nurturing, start-up incubation and research translation. It also aligns with the Government's vision to create a vibrant I&T ecosystem and enlarge the I&T talent pool.

  Hong Kong enjoys a unique advantage of having strong support from the motherland and a close connection with the world, converging global innovation resources, including high-calibre talents. The Government is committed to developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre. Notable progress has been made. Over the past two years, for example, we have attracted over 200 I&T enterprises with high potential and representativeness to set up or expand their businesses here. To all the young talents present today, I encourage you to seize this opportunity to collaborate, innovate and push the boundaries of what is possible.

  In closing, I wish Hong Kong Techathon+ 2026 a resounding success. I look forward to seeing your innovative ideas take flight. Thank you very much."

梁唐青儀會長（同心同根會創會會長、同心同根萬里行2025活動召集人暨團長）、盧頌揚副處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室青年工作部副處長）、顧笑洋女士（同心同根萬里行2025榮譽團長）、各位嘉賓、各位青年朋友：

大家好！今天很高興出席同心同根萬里行2025授旗禮，見證各位啓程踏上這個別具意義的交流之旅。

同心同根萬里行是香港青少年制服團體攜手籌辦的大型內地交流活動，自二○○二年首次舉行以來，一直為香港青少年提供前往內地不同城市實地考察及交流的機會。在此，我感謝主辦機構以及所有相關單位歷年來的悉心策劃，帶領青年成員走遍祖國進行考察，不但增強了青年對祖國國情及國家發展的了解，更強化他們維護國家安全的意識與責任感，意義深遠。

國家主席習近平強調「青年興，則香港興」。青年是國家與香港未來的棟樑，特區政府非常重視青年工作，並在二○二二年公布了《青年發展藍圖》，整全地勾劃未來青年發展工作的理念、願景及方針。《藍圖》推出至今已制訂約250項具體行動和措施，並已完成當中近100項措施，以致力培育廣大青年成為愛國愛港、具備世界視野、有抱負的新一代。同心同根萬里行的宗旨與《藍圖》的政策方針高度契合，致力於傳承愛國愛港精神、深化家國情懷，為青年日後建設香港、貢獻國家奠定堅實基礎。

各位青年朋友，你們參加今次以齊魯海上歷史文化之旅為主題的考察交流團，將前往北京、威海、煙台及青島，行程包括觀看天安門廣場升旗儀式及參觀國家大劇院，深入了解祖國歷史文化和國情；還會參訪多個在企業、航天、國防教育等領域具代表性的設施，親身感受國家發展脈搏。

我鼓勵你們好好把握這次交流機會，細心觀察、感受，體驗內地不同城市的風土人情，認識中華文化的深厚底蘊和國家發展的驕人成就。同時，我也期望大家在旅途上能珍惜與內地青年朋友交流的機會，向他們說好香港故事，相互學習並建立真摰的友誼；回港後亦請大家多與身邊的同學、朋友和家人分享所見所聞、所感所悟，令到今次旅程的收穫能啓發更多人，讓家國情懷得以薪火相傳。

我衷心感謝在座各位對青年發展的支持，並期望同心同根會和各制服團體繼續與政府並肩前行，扶掖香港青年展現潛能，實現理想，培育香港青年成為胸懷家國，又具國際視野的棟樑之才。

最後，我祝同心同根萬里行2025圓滿成功，亦祝各位青年朋友在今次旅程中收穫豐富，滿載而歸！多謝大家。"
特區政府強烈譴責美國假借所謂「國家緊急狀態」抹黑香港,2025-07-11 19:18,2025-07-11 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100677.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（七月十一日）強烈譴責美國政府假借延長所謂「國家緊急狀態」，再次以政治凌駕法治，妄圖以卑劣政治技倆詆毀香港特區依法防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的工作。

特區政府發言人表示：「美國一再公然違反國際法和國際關係的基本準則，透過再度延長所謂『針對香港局勢宣布的國家緊急狀態』，肆意干預中國內政和香港事務，實屬蠻橫無理。美國一再妄議香港情況，繼續對香港實施所謂『制裁』，妄圖干預香港依法施政、破壞香港法治和社會繁榮穩定，其卑劣圖謀注定不會得逞。」

「危害國家安全是嚴重的罪行，沒有國家會對危害國家安全的行為和活動袖手旁觀。在維護國家安全方面的法律，美國就最少有21部。美國卻對香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制指手畫腳，全然漠視香港特區訂立相關法律的憲制責任和實際需要，以及在維護國家安全的相關法律訂立後，對經濟發展和人權保障所帶來的正面效果，是實實在在的雙重標準。」

發言人指︰「《香港國安法》實施五年多以來，香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關的人或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與其政治立場、背景或職業無關。香港特區律政司按《基本法》第六十三條主管刑事檢控工作，所有檢控決定均是基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析後作出。所有被告均嚴格按照香港適用法律（包括《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》），並在《基本法》及《香港人權法案》的保障下接受公平審訊。」

「自香港回歸祖國以來，人權一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。香港特區維護國家安全的法律框架，與相關國際人權標準一致。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由。」

發言人重申︰「特區政府會一如既往堅定不移、全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府強烈要求美國立即停止不符合國際法和國際關係基本準則的行為，立即停止干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」"

CHP investigates case of invasive meningococcal infection,2025-07-11 19:15,2025-07-11 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100661.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (July 11) is investigating a case of invasive meningococcal infection, and reminds the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of contracting this serious disease.

The case involved a 63-year-old female, who presented with fever and vomiting on July 9. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital and was admitted for treatment on the same day. Her blood specimen tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was meningococcaemia. The patient is now in stable condition.

  An initial investigation revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. Her household contacts have remained asymptomatic so far. The CHP will distribute preventive drugs to her close contacts, and continue the investigation.

  Meningococcal infection is one of the statutory notifiable diseases. As of today, the CHP has recorded seven cases this year.

Meningococcal infection is caused by a bacterium known as meningococcus. It is mainly transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, of infected persons. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream (meningococcaemia) or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord (meningococcal meningitis). Meningococcaemia is characterised by a sudden onset of fever, an intense headache, purpura, shock and even death in severe cases. Meningococcal meningitis is characterised by high fever, severe headache, stiff neck followed by drowsiness, vomiting, fear of bright light, or rash; it can cause brain damage or even death.

To prevent meningococcal infection, members of the public are advised to take the following measures:


Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly, especially when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing, and clean hands with alcohol-based handrub when they are not visibly soiled;
Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, hold the saliva with a tissue, dispose of nasal and mouth discharge in a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands immediately;
Avoid crowded places;
Avoid close contact with patients who have a fever or severe headache;
Consult doctors about meningococcal vaccination before travelling to high-risk areas; and
Seek medical advice if you become ill after returning from high-risk areas, and discuss your recent travel history with your doctor.


The public may visit the CHP'swebsitefor more information on meningococcal infection."
衞生防護中心調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案,2025-07-11 19:15,2025-07-11 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100632.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月十一日）正調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案，同時提醒市民時刻注意個人和環境衞生，以減低被傳染這種嚴重疾病的風險。

個案涉及一名63歲女子。她於七月九日開始出現發燒和嘔吐，同日到瑪麗醫院急症室求醫，需留院治療。她的血液樣本經化驗後，證實對腦膜炎雙球菌呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為腦膜炎雙球菌血症。病人現時情況穩定。

初步調查顯示，病人潛伏期內沒有外遊，她的家居接觸者至今沒有出現病徵。中心會向其密切接觸者派發預防性藥物並繼續進行調查。

侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染是法定須呈報傳染病，截至今日，中心今年共錄得七宗個案。

腦膜炎雙球菌感染是由腦膜炎雙球菌所引起，主要經由直接接觸帶菌者的呼吸道分泌物（包括口鼻分泌物）而傳播。當細菌入侵血液（腦膜炎雙球菌血症）或包圍腦部及脊髓的內膜（流行性腦膜炎）時，可引致嚴重病症。腦膜炎雙球菌血症的病徵包括突發性發燒、劇烈頭痛、皮膚出現瘀斑及休克，嚴重者甚至會致命。流行性腦膜炎的病徵包括發高燒、劇烈頭痛、頸部僵硬及嗜睡，亦會有嘔吐、畏光或皮疹等情況出現，若情況嚴重更可造成腦部損害或死亡。

中心呼籲市民採取以下預防措施以預防腦膜炎雙球菌感染：


用梘液和清水正確洗手，尤其在雙手被呼吸道分泌物污染時，如打噴嚏後。當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，可用酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應掩着口鼻，用紙巾包裹痰涎，棄置於有蓋的垃圾桶內，並即時洗手；
避免到人多擠迫的地方；
避免與出現發燒或劇烈頭痛病徵的病人作親密接觸；
前往高危地區前，應諮詢醫生有關接種腦膜炎雙球菌疫苗的詳情；及
從高危地區返港後若感到不適，應立即求診，並告知醫生近期曾到訪的地區。


市民可參閱衞生防護中心網頁以取得更多有關腦膜炎雙球菌感染的資料。"
Remarks by SDEV on quarterly land sale programme for July to September 2025 (with video),2025-07-11 19:13,2025-07-11 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100641.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, at a media session today (July 11) on the quarterly land sale programme for July to September 2025:

Reporter: Why is the Tsuen Wan land plot rolled out this time and what are the Government's expectations on this quarter's land sales? And secondly, what is the Government's strategy in terms of this fiscal year's land sales, given that only two plots are rolled out in the first two quarters? Is the Government confident in terms of the land-buying appetite of the private market and reaching the initial revenue goal?

Secretary for Development: First of all, we are rolling out this site in Tsuen Wan in the second quarter of this year because it is a readily available site. We have recently completed the resuming process for this site, and we have taken into account the fact that this is not a particularly large site, and it is relatively still small in scale and located in a mature urban area with good transport connections. So we think this kind of site will be of interest to the developers in the current climate of the property market.

As regards your second question regarding the overall supply for the second quarter, taking into account this Tsuen Wan site and together with six other cases involving lease modifications, we should be able to turn out land capable of supplying close to 5 000 flats, to be more exact, it is 4 950 units in this quarter. So it is a pretty good figure, actually, counting by a quarter. If we take into account also the supply from the first quarter, together it will reach about 6 000 units, about 45 per cent of our annual target for this year. So as a mid-term anticipated outturn, I think it suggests that we are moving in a stable manner towards our annual target.

Reporter: What is the likelihood of seeing some small and medium developers in Hong Kong facing loan defaults amid a downward trend in both the residential and commercial real estate market? And how will that affect the property market and also the sentiment in land bidding?

Secretary for Development: You have two questions. On the first one, about the financial situation of the SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) or the developers which are SMEs, I think I am not in a position to comment on the financial position of our developers in general. But looking at the lease modification figures that I have announced just now, we do have six lease modification cases, and not all are what we call major developers, some are small scale. So we can see that the market is actually still moving in quite a healthy manner, with some lease modifications taking place and some other processing. So I would not take a too-pessimistic attitude towards the financial situation of our SME developers.

On your second question, I think the property market has picked up a bit, if we look at the volume of transactions registered in the Land Registry. But again, I have to emphasise that, for the Development Bureau, we are rolling out land for the future development and the future needs of Hong Kong. So we cannot just look at the current movements in the property market. We also have to look ahead. And I think that overall, we are taking a prudent approach for our land sale programme.

在與江蘇省衞健委主任譚穎會面時，盧寵茂教授介紹香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）在推動中醫藥國際傳承創新及公立醫院高質量發展方面的工作。

盧寵茂教授說︰「特區政府正積極發展香港成為中醫及中藥國際化的橋頭堡，並推動香港中醫藥高質量、高水平及全方位發展。蘇港兩地在中醫藥學術傳承和人才交流上已建立了深厚基礎，隨着香港中醫醫院及政府中藥檢測中心永久大樓兩項旗艦項目於今年年底分階段投入服務，將有助兩地在中醫藥服務、人才培訓和檢測研究等領域進一步深化合作。」

在公立醫院高質量發展方面，盧寵茂教授強調特區政府會繼續積極推動更多公立醫院參與《國際醫院評審認證標準（中國）》（2021版）評審認證，以保持香港特區高標準的醫院管理及服務，以及與國家醫療衞生服務體系接軌。除了分別於去年十二月及今年三月成功通過評審並獲得相關認證的東區尤德夫人那打素醫院和威爾斯親王醫院外，醫院管理局將於今年內在瑪麗醫院、基督教聯合醫院及屯門醫院推行認證計劃，並計劃於二○二六年前分別在七個醫院聯網內各有一間大型急症醫院實行。透過公立醫院參加相關認證可向國際示範國家醫院認證標準，由香港擔當窗口角色，助力國家標準走向國際。就此，雙方亦探討推動兩地更多醫院採用相關認證標準，以提升國家標準的影響力。

盧寵茂教授早前亦參觀總部設於南京的先聲藥業。他向企業高層人員介紹特區政府在發展香港為國際醫療創新樞紐方面的措施，包括優化藥物及醫療器械（藥械）審批制度和推動臨床試驗的產業發展。

他表示︰「行政長官在二○二三年及二○二四年《施政報告》中宣布，會發展香港成為國際醫療創新樞紐。我們將於明年年底前成立『香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心』，推動加快新藥械的臨床應用。此外，特區政府亦會善用設於河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區的『粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所』，與深圳園區的『粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗中心』共同構建一站式臨床試驗協作平台。」

盧寵茂教授鼓勵內地藥廠善用「1+」新藥審批機制及明年開始分階段推行的「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制，將新研發藥物引入香港以應付本地醫療需要，並透過香港走向國際。他亦歡迎內地藥廠來港開展臨床試驗，充分發揮香港特區所具備的多項獨特優勢，從而促進先進生物醫藥技術的轉化和臨床應用。

盧寵茂教授明日將在南京出席第十三屆南京肝膽外科肝移植學術研討會和參觀當地一間醫院。"
Secretary for Health commences visit to Nanjing (with photos),2025-07-11 19:00,2025-07-11 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100575.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, arrived in Nanjing this afternoon (July 11) to meet with the Jiangsu Commission of Health to keep deepening collaboration and exchange on healthcare-related areas with the Mainland.

  During the meeting with the Commissioner of the Jiangsu Commission of Health, Ms Tan Ying, Professor Lo introduced the efforts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in promoting the international inheritance and innovation of Chinese medicine, as well as the high-quality development of public hospitals.

  Professor Lo said, ""The HKSAR Government is committed to developing Hong Kong into a bridgehead for the internationalisation of Chinese medicine and promoting the high-quality and high-standard development of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong on all fronts. Jiangsu and Hong Kong have established a solid foundation in Chinese medicine academic inheritance and talent exchange. By the end of this year, the two flagship projects, namely the Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) and the permanent Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute building, will commence services in phases. This will further strengthen the co-operation between the two places in the areas of Chinese medicine services, talent development and testing research.""

  Regarding the high-quality development of public hospitals, Professor Lo emphasised that the HKSAR Government will continue to promote the accreditation of more public hospitals under the China's International Hospital Accreditation Standards (2021 Version), with a view to maintaining the high standard of hospital management and services in the HKSAR while aligning with the national healthcare service system. Apart from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital, which have been successfully accredited in December last year and March this year respectively, the Hospital Authority will launch the accreditation programme at Queen Mary Hospital, United Christian Hospital and Tuen Mun Hospital this year, and plans to implement the programme at one major acute hospital under each of the seven hospital clusters by 2026. The participation of public hospitals in the relevant accreditation programme can serve as a demonstration to the international community of the national hospital accreditation standards, with Hong Kong acting as a gateway to facilitate the national standards going global. In this connection, both sides also explored ways to further encourage more hospitals in the two places to pursue accreditation under the relevant standards to amplify the impact of national standards.

  Professor Lo also visited Simcere Pharmaceutical Group headquartered in Nanjing earlier. He introduced the senior management of the company to the initiatives put forward by the HKSAR Government in developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub, including strengthening the approval regimes for drugs and medical devices, as well as promoting the development of the clinical trial industry.

  He said, ""The Chief Executive announced in his 2023 and 2024 Policy Addresses to develop Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. We will set up the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of next year to accelerate the clinical use of new drugs and medical devices. Moreover, the HKSAR Government will make full use of the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute located in the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, and working in collaboration with the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trials Center in the Shenzhen Park to jointly establish a one-stop clinical trial collaboration platform.""

  Professor Lo encouraged Mainland pharmaceutical companies to make good use of the ""1+"" mechanism and ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration, which will be rolled out in phases starting next year, to introduce newly developed drugs into Hong Kong to meet local healthcare needs and access international markets through Hong Kong. He also welcomed Mainland pharmaceutical companies to conduct clinical trials in Hong Kong, fully leveraging the multiple unique advantages of the HKSAR to facilitate the translation and clinical application of advanced biomedical technologies.

  Professor Lo will attend the 13th Nanjing Academic Symposium on Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation and visit a local hospital in Nanjing tomorrow."

各位傳媒朋友，大家好。今日我向大家介紹政府在今個財政年度第二季度，即七月至九月的賣地計劃。

政府在第二季會以招標方式推出一幅位於荃灣永順街與德士古道交界的住宅用地。這幅住宅用地可建住宅樓面面積大約39 000平方米，可提供約780個單位，另外我們亦會在這幅用地要求少量社福設施，大約940平方米。這幅用地選自二月公布的年度賣地表，土地位於成熟社區，周邊配套亦相當齊全，交通網絡很完善。這幅用地早前已經完成法定規劃程序，由政府、機構用途轉為住宅用途。

而今季其他住宅用地來源包括一些需要地契修訂的私人發展及重建項目，暫時預計有六個這類項目可以於今季完成土地行政手續，合共可提供約4 170個單位。值得留意的是，單是本季度的這些地契修訂項目已經超越了我們就這個來源的全年估算，可見土地發展市場都有相當活動。而這些地契修訂項目內，我剛才說有六個項目，包括發展局早前公布在洪水橋第34B區「加強版傳統新市鎮發展模式」下的一個換地個案，這是比較大宗的換地個案，涉及2 300個單位。該項目位處北部都會區發展潛力極高的洪水橋區域，配合該區的規劃，將可促進區內發展。

綜合以上我提到政府推售一幅土地及六宗地契修訂個案，本年度第二季的私人房屋土地供應預計可支持興建約4 950個單位。如果我計及第一季的供應，我們本年度上半年的私人房屋土地供應，預計可以合共提供約6 000個單位，是本年度供應目標的約百分之四十五。這個數字尚未反映第二季度來自一些不需要修訂地契的私人土地個案供應，因為這類數字一般要較後才有統計。到目前為止，我認為本年度供應尚算理想，我們預計全年能夠維持平穩的土地供應。

另外，我亦想藉此機會向大家交代上個財政年度經修訂後的實際供應，因為現時已到七月，上一個財政年度於三月尾完結，我上一次作交代是二月尾的時候，所以未有最終的數字。相對今年二月記者會時公布的估算，在上財政年度第四季度我們錄得多一宗較大型而無須修訂地契的私人重建項目，約有1 100個單位，所以去年二○二四至二五財政年度的私人房屋土地供應現時可調整為約10 030個單位，為該年度供應目標約七成半。

我們會繼續審時度勢、有節有度及務實地向市場推出土地，並會因應市況靈活調整我們的推地策略，照顧社會發展的需要。看看大家有甚麼提問。"

 The DEVB, being the party to procure services for public works, attaches great importance to the site safety performance of all construction sites under the purview of contractors on the List, regardless of whether the sites are public works construction sites or not. The DEVB issued a notification to the contractor concerned today to suspend it from tendering for public works contracts in the roads and drainage category with immediate effect pursuant to the regulating regime. The contractor concerned has to conduct an independent safety audit to review its safety management system. Taking cognisance of the outcome of the independent safety audit, the contractor is required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures, with a view to demonstrating that it has an effective safety management system before the lifting of the suspension from tendering can be considered. The suspension from tendering is not only confined to future tender exercises but is also applicable to tender exercises with procedures initiated but not concluded.

 The Labour Department is investigating this industrial incident and will handle it in accordance with the law. Subject to the investigation findings, the DEVB may impose further regulating actions on the contractor concerned later on, including extension of the period of suspension from tendering for public works contracts and even removal from the List."

尊敬的陳廳長（廣東省司法廳廳長陳旭東）、邱副局長（澳門特別行政區政府法務局副局長邱顯哲）、各位嘉賓：

大家好。我在此代表香港特區律政司感謝廣東省司法廳的邀請，讓我們一起參與這個對調解工作非常重要的活動，一同見證粵港澳三地共同實踐大灣區的調解機制對接、規則銜接、人才連接。

粵港澳大灣區有着「一國、兩制、三法域」的獨特法律環境。自二○一九年九月粵港澳大灣區法律部門聯席會議制度確立以來，律政司與廣東省司法廳及澳門特區行政法務司在大灣區法律建設工作上緊密合作，多年來在調解方面成果豐碩，促進大灣區法治化建設。

除了大灣區調解平台制定的《粵港澳大灣區調解員資格資歷評審標準》、《粵港澳大灣區調解員專業操守最佳準則》及《粵港澳大灣區跨境爭議調解示範規則》之外，去年十二月公布的《粵港澳大灣區調解員名冊（2024年）》更是標誌着大灣區調解機制對接的里程碑。這次共有146位大灣區調解員通過評審，其中48位經廣東評審認可，49位經澳門評審認可，餘下的49位經香港評審認可，為大灣區調解員隊伍注入新動力。

我藉此由衷祝賀48位廣東省的大灣區調解員獲認可加入《粵港澳大灣區調解員名冊》。你們有着卓越的專業水平，是行業中的翹楚，在每天的調解工作中努力幫當事人化解爭議。今日的頒證儀式是對你們成就的肯定，也希望激勵各位繼續為推進大灣區調解的發展貢獻力量。

我知道今日除了是廣東省大灣區調解員的頒證儀式，也是召開廣東商事調解工作會議的重要日子。廣東省司法廳一直在健全調解制度、統籌合作機制和建立專業調解隊伍等方面不遺餘力，十分值得我們學習。

粵港澳三地在調解方面的合作越趨緊密，攜手推動大灣區高質量發展，值得鼓舞。去年五月，廣東省高級人民法院印發了《關於吸納港澳調解組織成為粵港澳大灣區特邀調解組織的試點方案》，四個香港調解組織被納入首批特邀調解組織，在廣東省內的指定法院開展了試點工作，共同建立大灣區爭議解決人才庫。

調解能促進訴訟各方之間的溝通與理解，解決糾紛，保持各方良好關係，促進社會和諧。我再次祝賀今日獲頒證書的廣東省粵港澳大灣區調解員，期待粵港澳三地在大灣區法治建設方面的進一步合作，為大家帶來更多機遇。預祝這次活動圓滿舉行，謝謝。"

About 4.1 kilograms of suspected methamphetamine with an estimated market value of about $2.3 million was seized.

A 23-year-old non-local male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, yesterday. During Customs clearance, six bags of suspected methamphetamine, weighing about 4.1kg in total, were found in six boxes camouflaged as snacks inside his carry-on suitcase. The male was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (July 12).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

大家下午好。今日很榮幸應香港文聯邀請，為「中華文化節2025」《了不起的甲骨文》展覽擔任主禮嘉賓。

香港特區政府去年公布《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，以弘揚中華傳統優秀文化為重要的發展方向。去年我們首度舉辦的「中華文化節」，大獲好評，成績令人鼓舞。我們很高興香港文聯今年繼續大力支持，組織旗下多個分會和香港文化藝術界的精英，為本屆「中華文化節」籌辦十項精彩活動，包括重點節目之一，就是今日的《了不起的甲骨文》展覽。

甲骨文是中華民族珍貴的文化遺產，這個商周時期的成熟文字系統，對漢字的發展影響深遠。甲骨文的內容涵蓋傳統習俗、天文、地理、曆法等，是我國傳統文化的寶庫。這次展覽設有三個各具特色的展區，以「從甲骨文到現代漢字」展示漢字的演變為重心，並透過甲骨文藝術展及甲骨文科技展帶來多元體驗，以別具新意的形式呈現古老文字。這次展覽也特別安排了研討會、講座、導賞等一連串活動，通過互動交流，讓市民從多角度認識甲骨文。

河南是甲骨文的故鄉，香港文聯邀請到河南省人民政府新聞辦公室、河南日報社、河南省文化和旅遊廳、河南省文物局，以及安陽市人民政府擔任這次展覽合辦單位，也得到中國文字博物館和河南博物院大力支持，令整個展覽內容生色不少，我在此向各個合辦及支持單位，還有我們的中聯辦致以衷心的謝意。我也期待待會和大家一同參觀這批珍貴資料和體驗多元的呈現方式。

我期望市民和社會各界繼續踴躍參與，共同推動中華文化的傳承。最後，我祝願這次展覽和其他由香港文聯籌辦的節目圓滿成功。謝謝大家。"

房屋局就「簡約公屋」營運及管理服務合約招標,2025-07-11 14:30,2025-07-11 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100272.htm,"房屋局今日（七月十一日）就兩份「簡約公屋」項目的營運及管理服務合約進行招標，並鼓勵有能力和經驗的機構積極參與。

兩份合約均涉及第二期啟德世運道「簡約公屋」項目，分別負責營運及管理約4 500及3 200個單位。第二期啟德世運道項目共提供約7 700個單位，預計明年第三季落成。

房屋局發言人表示：「由於第二期啟德世運道項目規模較大，我們將項目分拆兩份合約進行招標，讓更多有經驗、有抱負的不同機構有機會參與營運管理。」

與之前批出的合約一樣，「簡約公屋」的營運及管理服務除包括住戶事務管理、物業管理、日常保養維修，亦涵蓋社會服務，以及管理和營運一系列配套設施等範疇。為推動社會上不同持份者的參與，房屋局歡迎有能力和經驗的服務承辦商投標，包括非政府機構及持有物業管理公司牌照的機構，或是兩者合作。

為確保服務質素，房屋局會根據投標機構的管理能力、相關經驗、過往的服務表現，以及其計劃書內建議的營運和管理模式、提供的社會服務、遷出計劃的可行性、創新和資訊科技的應用等一系列因素作出技術評審，務求令「簡約公屋」的設施和服務切合居民和地區需要，再就投標價格作出綜合評審，選出最合適的機構負責營運「簡約公屋」。

房屋局至今已批出四份「簡約公屋」營運及管理服務合約，涵蓋元朗攸壆路、牛頭角彩興路及彩石里（即前聖若瑟英文中學）、屯門青福里（即屯門第3A區），以及第一期啟德世運道項目。另外，房屋局正在評審第五及第六份營運及管理服務合約的投標書，分別涉及四個改裝校舍項目，以及柴灣常安街項目。

發言人說：「首個位於元朗攸壆路的『簡約公屋』項目，約2 100個單位已於六月中全面入伙。而第二個落成、首個位於市區的牛頭角彩興路項目，第一期約1 000個單位亦剛於六月三十日開始入伙。隨着『簡約公屋』項目陸續入伙，可為有需要人士提供更好的居住環境、更全面的生活配套、更低的租金、更大的生活空間，以至一系列的社會服務和支援。政府樂見更多社會上有迫切住屋需要的人士在『簡約公屋』直接而切實的援助下，得以即時大幅改善生活環境及質素，他們的幸福感和獲得感亦有所提升。同時，『簡約公屋』正好為有需要的『劏房』租戶提供適切的住屋選擇。」

Tenders for operation and management contracts of Light Public Housing invited,2025-07-11 14:30,2025-07-11 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100275.htm,"âThe Housing Bureau (HB) today (July 11) invites tenders for two operation and management contracts of Light Public Housing (LPH), and encourages capable and experienced organisations to participate.

The two contracts, relating to Phase 2 of the LPH project at Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak, are for the operation and management of about 4 500 and 3 200 units respectively. Phase 2 of the LPH project at Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak, will provide about 7 700 units in total and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of next year.

A spokesperson for the HB said, ""Taking into account that Phase 2 of the LPH project at Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak, is relatively larger in scale, it is divided into two separate contracts to encourage participation from different experienced and aspirational organisations.""

Same as the contracts already awarded, the operation and management services for the LPH projects not only cover occupant management, property management and daily maintenance, but also the provision of social services as well as the management and operation of ancillary facilities, etc. To encourage participation of different stakeholders in the community, the HB welcomes tenders from all capable and experienced service providers, including non-government organisations and those with a valid property management company licence, or collaborations between them.

To ensure service quality, the HB will carry out technical assessments based on a series of factors, including management capability, relevant experience and past service performance of the organisations, as well as the proposed modes of operation and management, social services to be provided, feasibility of an exit plan and use of innovation and information technology as stated in their proposals so that the facilities and services of the LPH projects can meet the needs of the residents and the local community. The tender price will then be evaluated to form a consolidated assessment to decide on the most suitable organisation for operating the LPH projects.

The HB has so far awarded four LPH operation and management contracts, covering LPH projects at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long; Choi Hing Road and Choi Shek Lane (i.e. the former St Joseph's Anglo-Chinese School), Ngau Tau Kok; Tsing Fuk Lane, Tuen Mun (i.e. Tuen Mun Area 3A); and Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 1). Separately, the HB is now evaluating tenders for the fifth and sixth operation and management contracts covering four school conversion projects and an LPH project at Sheung On Street, Chai Wan, respectively.

The spokesperson said, ""The tenant intake for the first LPH project at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long, providing about 2 100 units, was fully completed in mid-June. The second LPH project at Choi Hing Road, Ngau Tau Kok, also being the first LPH project in urban area, has commenced its tenant intake on June 30 for Phase 1, which provides about 1 000 units. With gradual tenant intake of the LPH projects, the people in need can be provided with an improved living environment, more comprehensive living facilities, and more living space at a lower rent as well as a series of social services and support. The Government is pleased to see more people with the most pressing housing needs in society being able to improve their living environment and quality significantly and immediately through the direct and practical assistance provided by LPH. Their sense of well-being and fulfilment has also been enhanced. At the same time, the LPH projects can suitably serve as an adequate housing option for the tenants of subdivided units in need.""

Interested organisations may download the tender documents via the relevant tender notices on the HB's website (www.hb.gov.hk) or from the e-Tendering System; or contact the Dedicated Team on Light Public Housing under the HB for obtaining the tender documents. The tender references are HB2025/OPR-LPH-OA2 and HB2025/OPR-LPH-OA3 respectively.

Tenderers must submit the tenders by noon on August 29, 2025 (Friday), either electronically via the e-Tendering System or by deposit in the Government Secretariat Tender Box situated at Lobby of the Public Entrance on Ground Floor, East Wing, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar. Late tenders will not be accepted."
署理醫務衞生局局長在立法會衞生事務委員會會議就提升公營醫療服務的最新進展的開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-11 14:05,2025-07-11 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100415.htm,"​以下是署理醫務衞生局局長李夏茵醫生今日（七月十一日）在立法會衞生事務委員會會議就提升公營醫療服務的最新進展的開場發言：

主席：

​接下來，我會向立法會衞生事務委員會簡介提升公營醫療服務的最新進展。

​香港擁有高水平的醫療專業和高效率的醫療系統，不過隨着人口老化，慢性疾病急速上升，加上公營醫護人手短缺及醫療科技進步所帶來的種種成本上升和治療機遇，為香港醫療系統帶來很多結構性挑戰。因此，醫院管理局（醫管局）積極配合醫務衞生局推動系統性改革。

​回顧本屆政府上任初期，整個公營醫療體系需要集中資源應付新冠病毒疫情。隨着疫情逐漸緩和及復常，以及各項防疫措施於二○二三年年初撤銷，公營醫療服務已全面復常。不僅如此，醫管局更着力透過逐步落實六個重點：（一）優化公營醫療服務；（二）建設重點疾病中心；（三）推動醫療服務╱藥械創新；（四）促進跨境合作及交流；（五）加強醫護人手，以及（六）推進公營醫療收費改革，共六個範疇的政策措施，提升公營醫療服務的質素和效率。

​在優化服務方面，醫管局在普通科門診正分階段加入慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃及婦女健康服務，為弱勢社群提供相關服務。另外，醫管局亦採取了多項措施，成功縮短內科、耳鼻喉科及骨科專科門診輪候時間超過10-20%，並進一步優化專科門診的分流制度和轉介安排。醫管局亦加強了白內障手術，單計今年上半年完成的手術數量已較去年同期增加約2 000宗，亦縮短了手術的輪候時間。另外值得一提的是醫管局自二○二三年四月在中央援港應急醫院推出「日間放射診斷服務先導計劃」，至今年五月共為超過49 000名病人提供服務，各項放射診斷的輪候時間中位數由122-129星期大幅縮短至25-55星期。此外，醫管局亦落實了整合兒科服務、在香港兒童醫院開展更多先進醫療服務，以及持續發展中西醫協作服務、重啓醫院認證計劃等措施。

​第二個重點是重點疾病中心。為了提高診斷效率，並加快病人接受治療的時間，醫管局正積極建設重點疾病中心，包括胸痛中心、中風中心、神經系統疾病及心血管疾病的綜合醫療中心，以及中毒控制中心。當中瑪麗醫院胸痛中心自建立「綠色通道」後，其緊急個案「到院至灌流時間」中位數已由過往的105分鐘大幅縮短至63分鐘；中風中心方面，自運行「綠色通道」後，屯門醫院的中風病人由抵達急症室至「開始靜脈溶栓治療時間」中位數由二○二四年頭兩季的45分鐘下降至二○二五年第一季的31分鐘，而瑪麗醫院則由63.5分鐘下降至53分鐘。

​第三個重點關於創新。為了推動臨床研究發展，提升醫療服務的質素與創新，醫管局成立了「中央臨床研究及創新辦公室」，與「粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所」及其他科研機構展開合作；並設立了「聯網臨床研究支援辦公室」，支援員工參與臨床研究。醫管局亦加強集中藥械採購及加快引入創新藥械，一方面提升採購效率，另一方面為病人帶來更多安全、具療效及成本效益的治療選擇。

​第四個發展重點是跨境合作。「大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃」已於去年十一月推出，安排以「點對點」模式於指定醫院之間直接運送有特定需要及臨床狀況合適的病人到香港，無需在口岸轉換救護車，從而減低病人在運送過程的風險。截至今年六月底，粵港澳三地已成功將12名病人運送到香港公立醫院接受治療。

​第五個發展重點在醫護人手方面，除了加強吸引和挽留本地醫療人才外，醫管局亦致力在全球各地招聘合適的非本地培訓醫療人才，包括醫生、護士及專職醫療人員。醫管局亦積極與大灣區及多個內地省市擴展醫療人才交流計劃，同時安排了轄下百多名醫護人員前往廣東、北京和上海等地的醫院作雙向交流。截至二○二五年五月底，共有309名非本地培訓醫生在醫管局工作或交流，順利達成相關的項目指標。

​最後，醫管局一直有序落實《施政報告》各項政策措施及指標，並會繼續按目標推進各項政策措施，包括透過公營醫療收費改革，引導市民善用醫療資源、減少浪費和濫用，以至運用改革所得將全數投放公營醫療，加強對「貧、急、重、危」病人的醫療保障，以提升公營醫療服務的整體表現和運作效率，並希望維持其可持續性。

​正如習近平主席說：「改革永遠在路上，改革之路無坦途」，醫務衞生局會聯同全港市民，堅定走向醫療改革的路，建設「健康香港」。

​多謝主席。"
