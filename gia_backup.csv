律政司司長在立法會司法及法律事務委員會會議就香港國際法律人才培訓學院的發展及其能力建設項目的進展開場發言（只有中文）,2025-09-15 12:00,2025-09-15 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/15/P2025091500344.htm,"​以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（九月十五日）在立法會司法及法律事務委員會會議上，就香港國際法律人才培訓學院的發展及其能力建設項目的進展的開場發言：

主席、各位委員︰

感謝委員會邀請我和我的同事出席今天的會議。我將會向主席及各位委員概述律政司香港國際法律人才培訓學院的工作及其能力建設項目的進展，歡迎主席及各位委員就學院的工作和未來發展給予意見。

學院於二○二四年十一月八日香港法律周期間正式啟動成立。學院自啟動成立以來，已積極開展和推出多個能力建設項目，為香港本地、國家和國際的法律和爭議解決業界提供不同形式和不同主題的法律實務培訓。

在學院啟動短短幾個月時間，已經拓展了面向國際的培訓交流，與多個國際組織建立互信合作，在本地和其他地區合辦多元化的項目，當中包括今年三月與聯合國國際貿易法委員會在香港合辦氣候變化與國際貿易法會議；五月在中美洲多明尼加共和國舉行的2025世界法律大會期間組織「通過能力建設促進國際法律合作」專題研討會；七月與國際統一私法協會在羅馬合辦「香港：通往亞太區的門戶」專題研討會，以及於八月與聯合國國際貿易法委員會在韓國仁川舉辦亞太經合組織的「運用國際工具以法律方式實現貿易端到端數位元化工作坊」。

針對內地部委和機構的需求，學院亦加強與相關部委交流合作，提供了量身定制的培訓項目，包括率先在今年一月與國家最高人民法院在香港合辦香港普通法司法實務研修班、二月與國家司法部在香港合辦全國涉外仲裁人才培訓班（香港），為學院培訓項目打響頭炮，更在五月移師內地，在西安舉辦香港普通法與爭議解決實務培訓。

本地業界除了可一起參與以上的培訓項目外，學院更針對本地業界設立專門的培訓，包括今年六月在香港為本地律師和爭議解決業界人士舉辦為期兩天的2025年內地民商事法律實務課程，及七月與外交部駐港公署合作「香港青年國際法律人才帶路行」，安排本地年青律師參訪北京和喀什與「一帶一路」倡議相關的國家機關、法律機構、國際組織、高新技術企業等。

根據上述項目參加者的反饋，學員對學院培訓內容和教學質素表示高度肯定，認為課程實用且具啟發性。學員們普遍反映，這些培訓對他們的專業發展有幫助，並期待學院未來能提供更多類似的培訓機會。

未來，學院將繼續與本地、內地及國際法律專業機構和單位保持緊密的合作，致力推出更多元化、更深入和更廣泛的實務培訓項目，為不同機構的需求量身定制課程。

學院現正計劃和籌備的培訓項目包括今年九月二十四日在香港舉辦打擊洗黑錢和反貪動向講座；十月邀請約30位中國企業法律顧問來香港參加中國企業出海法律實務培訓班；十一月在香港舉辦第三屆三地法律部門人員同堂培訓班和在上海與高級人民法院合辦上海涉外審判人才研修班，並再次與聯合國國際貿易法委員會合作在十二月初香港法律周2025期間舉辦第六屆聯合國國際貿易法委員會亞太司法高峰會2025等，為香港本地、國家和國際法律業界提供實務培訓。

學院將持續發揮香港中英雙語普通法的獨特優勢，致力鞏固香港作為亞太區國際法律及解決爭議服務中心的樞紐地位，打造成為全球的法治人才高地，為「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠注入法治動能，並在國家涉外法治建設中更好發揮作用。

總括而言，學院的工作彰顯了律政司在培養法律專業人才方面的長期努力與成果。我們期待聽取各位委員的指導和意見。

​多謝主席。"

逾200間家辦落戶香港　財庫局和投資推廣署攜手超前完成績效指標,2025-09-15 11:52,2025-09-15 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/15/P2025091500301.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）今日（九月十五日）宣布，在政府大力推動下，至今經投資推廣署協助來港落戶或擴展業務的家族辦公室（家辦）數目已突破200間，超前完成二○二二年《施政報告》所訂立的績效指標，令香港作為亞洲領先的跨境私人財富管理中心及全球家族辦公室樞紐的地位更為穩固。

為強化本港資產及財富管理業這重要的金融增長領域，行政長官於二○二二年在其首份《施政報告》便提出在二○二五年年底前推動不少於200間家辦在港設立或擴展業務的明確目標。財庫局隨後於二○二三年三月發表政策宣言，展示政府積極完善家族辦公室和資產擁有人的生態圈的決心，並透過推出八大措施，包括提供稅務優惠、引入「新資本投資者入境計劃」、設立香港財富傳承學院等，為開拓家族辦公室相關產業打造最具競爭力的有利環境。

同時，投資推廣署的FamilyOfficeHK專責團隊也擴大職能，並建立新的家族辦公室服務提供者網絡，集合各相關專業服務領域的團隊，為家辦提供更全面的服務和協助。專責團隊亦在世界各地加強宣傳和舉辦以家辦為主題的活動，包括在內地、歐洲和東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）等地區進行路演，並在全球主要市場發表專題文章，主動與有意在港落戶的超高資產淨值人士接洽。而政府每年舉辦的旗艦家辦活動「裕澤香江」高峰論壇亦匯聚眾多全球具影響力的家辦決策人來港。

有見「新資本投資者入境計劃」自推出以來甚受相關客戶群青睞，政府今年三月更優化該計劃，進一步增強香港對全球高淨值人士來港投資及落戶的吸引力。相關優化措施包括申請人透過具資格單一家辦管理並由申請人全資擁有的私人公司所持有的獲許投資資產亦可計算入合資格投資金額內。在符合該入境計劃其他要求的前提下，投資者如在香港連續通常居住七年或以上，並符合《入境條例》訂明的其他相關規定，便可依法申請成為香港永久性居民。

過去兩年多來，八大措施聯合產生強大吸引力。經投資推廣署協助來港落戶或擴展的家辦自二○二二年至今已逾200間，此數字還未涵蓋自行或透過本港專業服務網絡而落戶的家辦，故此香港作為家辦樞紐的實際發展規模其實更為可觀。而作為亞洲最大的跨境財富管理中心，香港的資產管理總值於二○二四年年底也突破35萬億港元，按年增長13%，淨資金流入更大幅上升逾80%至7,050億港元，反映香港作為國際資產配置中心的魅力持續增強。

財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇表示：「經過政府兩年多來的積極推動和在政策層面營造穩定、具可預測性的有利發展環境，家辦已銳變為本港金融業的重要一環。香港匯聚家辦所需的優越條件，包括國際化的專業服務和優質宜居的生活環境，亦具備發展綠色投資、藝術品及慈善事業等業務的有利優勢，為家族辦公室構建多元且完善的生態圈。投資推廣署能夠提前實現引進200間家族辦公室的目標，正是充分展現香港在私人財富及資產管理方面的強大競爭優勢。我們將繼續優化政策措施，包括進一步優化基金、單一家辦和附帶權益的優惠稅制，延續家辦發展的增長勢頭。」

投資推廣署署長劉凱旋表示：「作為全球第二大的跨境財富管理中心，香港是投資者首選的財富管理樞紐。作為策略性投資者，家辦積極參與本地創科及初創企業投資，助力推動香港創新經濟的可持續發展。投資推廣署除了積極吸引更多家辦落戶香港，亦致力構建資本對接平台，推動金融與科技雙引擎發展。透過資本投入帶動科研創新，進一步吸引耐心資本，形成良性循環，為香港的多元經濟注入持續動能。」

投資推廣署家族辦公室環球總裁方展光表示：「香港擁有逾百年私人財富管理的深厚根基，是全球高淨值家族設立及營運家辦的理想據點。隨着本地家辦生態圈持續蓬勃發展，這股動能正有效帶動資本市場、專業服務及人才發展形成良性循環。完善的傳承規劃能有效避免家族爭產糾紛，維護企業治理與社會形象。我們致力協助更多家族建立完善的傳承機制，實現財富與價值觀的世代傳承。」

展望未來，政府會進一步優化基金、單一家辦和附帶權益的優惠稅制。而投資推廣署也會繼續與商會、行業協會及家辦服務提供者網絡攜手，深化國際交往合作，以及持續擴展推廣工作，提升全球對以香港這個區內領先家族辦公室樞紐的認知度。"
FSTB and InvestHK jointly attract over 200 family offices to Hong Kong and achieve early completion of KPI,2025-09-15 11:52,2025-09-15 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/15/P2025091500314.htm,"  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) announced today (September 15) that under the vigorous promotion by the Government, over 200 family offices have set up operations or expanded their business in Hong Kong with the facilitation of Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK). This also marks an achievement of early completion of the key performance indicator set in the 2022 Policy Address well ahead of schedule, signalling that the city's standing as Asia's leading cross-border private wealth management centre and hub for global family offices is firmly anchored to a greater extent.

  To strengthen this key growth segment of the asset and wealth management industry, the Chief Executive in his first Policy Address put forward a clear target of facilitating no fewer than 200 family offices in establishing or expanding their operations in Hong Kong by the end of 2025. Subsequently, the FSTB published in March 2023 a policy statement to demonstrate the Government's commitment to enhancing the ecosystem for family offices and asset owners. The policy statement outlined eight policy measures, including offering tax concessions, introducing the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (New CIES), and establishing the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy, with a view to curating a conducive and competitive environment for the businesses of family offices.

  At the same time, the dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team of InvestHK expanded its role and launched a new Network of Family Office Service Providers to serve as a platform for family offices to access the expertise of various professional services so as to provide comprehensive services and facilitation. The dedicated team also stepped up promotion and hosted activities under the theme of family offices around the globe, including running roadshows in Mainland China, Europe, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, publishing featured articles in major markets worldwide, and taking a proactive approach with ultra-high-net-worth individuals interested in establishing a presence in Hong Kong. As the annual flagship event for family offices, the Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit organised by the Government also brought to the city many influential global family office principals.

  Considering the positive response from the targeted client base to the New CIES, the Government made enhancements to the Scheme this March to further raise the city's appeal to global high-net-worth individuals seeking to invest and settle in Hong Kong. Relevant enhancements include that investments in permissible investment assets made through a private company wholly owned by an applicant and managed by an eligible single family office can be counted towards the value of the applicant's eligible investments. Subject to the fulfilment of other requirements of the scheme, an entrant may apply in accordance with the law to become a permanent resident of Hong Kong if he or she meets the requirement of having ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years and other relevant provisions of the Immigration Ordinance.

  Over the past two years or so, the eight policy measures together have created a strong attractive force. Since 2022 until now, more than 200 family offices have established or expanded their presence in Hong Kong with support from InvestHK. The reported figure does not cover family offices that have established themselves independently or through support from the city's professional services network. In other words, the actual scale of Hong Kong's development as a family office hub is even more substantial. Furthermore, as the largest cross-border wealth management centre in Asia, Hong Kong's total assets under management surpassed $35 trillion as of end-2024, a year-on-year increase of 13 per cent, with net fund inflows surging by over 80 per cent to $705 billion, reflecting the growing appeal of Hong Kong as an international asset allocation hub.

  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""Upon the active promotion and policy support by the Government in fostering a stable and predictable environment conducive to development over the past two years or so, family offices are now an important component of Hong Kong's financial industry. Hong Kong is a place where favourable conditions for family offices converge, ranging from world-class professional services and a high-quality, liveable lifestyle to strong advantages for the development of sectors such as green investments, art and philanthropy. All these contribute to a diverse and well-rounded ecosystem for family offices. The fact that InvestHK has surpassed the milestone of attracting 200 family offices ahead of schedule is a testament to this city's strong competitive advantage in private wealth and asset management. We will continue to refine our policy measures, such as further enhancing the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and carried interest, to keep up the growth momentum of the family office sector.""

  The Director-General of Investment Promotion, Ms Alpha Lau, noted, ""As the world's second-largest cross border wealth management centre, Hong Kong is a preferred destination for investors. As strategic investors, family offices actively invest in local innovation and technology as well as start-ups, contributing to the sustainable growth of Hong Kong's innovation economy. In addition to actively attracting more family offices to set up in Hong Kong, InvestHK is also committed to building a capital matching platform to promote the dual development of finance and technology. Through capital investment that fuels research and innovation, the expanded innovation and technology ecosystem can attract more patient capital, creating a virtuous cycle that injects sustained momentum into Hong Kong's diversified economy.""

  The Global Head of Family Office at InvestHK, Mr Jason Fong, added, ""Hong Kong has a strong foundation in private wealth management for over 100 years and serves as an ideal hub for global high-net-worth families to establish and operate family offices. As Hong Kong's family office ecosystem continues to thrive, it is creating a reinforcing cycle that fuels the development of capital markets, professional services, and talent. Robust succession planning plays a critical role in mitigating family disputes over inheritance, enhancing corporate governance and preserving the family's reputation. We are dedicated to assisting more families in establishing a robust succession mechanism, enabling the smooth transfer of both wealth and values across generations.""

  Moving forward, the Government will enhance the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and carried interest. Meanwhile, InvestHK will keep up its work with chambers of commerce, industry associations, and the Network of Family Office Service Providers to deepen international collaboration, as well as expanding outreach to raise global awareness of Hong Kong as a leading family office hub.

徐小林副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室協調部副部長）、郭志華會長（香港中小型企業聯合會會長）、蔡宏興總監（市區重建局行政總監）、莊偉茵總裁（中華電力有限公司企業發展總裁）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好，很高興能夠來到九龍城，與大家一起見證《小街道大聯盟》地膽推介龍城篇的展開！

首先，很多謝香港中小型企業聯合會再次聯同社區和不同機構，將「小街道大聯盟」的意念，推展到不同地區，透過聯動小區或街道內中小微商戶推出優惠，吸引區內外人士和遊客，帶動消費和人流，讓區內的商戶能夠「齊齊有生意」。

去年，「小街道大聯盟」在中西區以懷舊為主題，趁聖誕及農曆新年旺季，向旅客「講故仔」，介紹中西區歷史與藝術，同時推介本地以至世界不同的美食。Andrew（香港中小型企業聯合會會長郭志華）告訴我，活動令參與的小區商戶整體增加約兩成生意額，成效不錯。

我知道，今年「小街道大聯盟」由中西區，走到灣仔及九龍城。暑假時，就以文學建築為題，在灣仔舉行；緊接現在九月、十月，就來到九龍城。九龍城是一個非常有特色的地方，充滿歷史故事，見證香港歲月和社會發展。來到這裏，我最大的回憶就是啟德舊機場，因為我加入政府前就是在航空公司工作，仍然記得飛機在這個小區低飛的情景，當然還有附近不少出名的潮州菜館及泰菜館。今日會場都布置了這些香港獨有風貌的「打卡位」，以及美食車仔檔，我相信今次地膽推介龍城篇的內容會非常豐富。

我希望各位今日能夠玩得開心，盡情消費，並多多透過不同的社交平台為小商戶宣傳和推介，讓更多市民及遊客看到龍城新舊風貌，品嚐九龍城特色美食。

「小街道大聯盟」起了非常好的示範作用，鼓勵商界積極與各界攜手合作，發掘機遇。我感謝商會、市區重建局和中華電力有限公司對地區經濟和發展的支持，祝願活動在九龍城順利舉行，商會亦繼續將「小街道大聯盟」帶到不同的地區，發掘各區的特色，聯動商戶，刺激消費，帶動整體經濟。謝謝。"
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-15 11:10,2025-09-15 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/15/P2025091500311.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 15) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

行政長官在第三屆粵港澳大灣區發展工商大會致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-09-15 11:00,2025-09-15 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/15/P2025091500239.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（九月十五日）在第三屆粵港澳大灣區發展工商大會的視像致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興以視頻參與第三屆粵港澳大灣區發展工商大會。

繼澳門和香港以後，本屆工商大會落地另一個大灣區中心城市——廣州。本屆大會在中國國際貿易促進委員會和粵港澳三地政府的努力下，再次匯聚各地的政商界代表共商大灣區建設。首先，我熱烈祝賀本屆大會順利舉行！

粵港澳大灣區建設是習近平主席親自謀劃、親自部署、親自推動的重大國家戰略，是引領國家高質量發展的重要引擎。

作為大灣區中心城市之一，香港一直與大灣區各城市優勢互補，緊密合作。香港積極發揮「一國兩制」下內聯外通的優勢，以高度法治化、市場化、國際化的營商環境，和世界前列的專業服務，擔當「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台角色。

在中央的大力支持和粵港澳三地的共同努力下，大灣區建設成果豐碩。其中，「港車北上」和快將落實的「粵車南下」，以及促進人才「南下、北上」雙向流動的便利措施，為人員流動帶來更大便利。

在推動物流發展方面，香港與東莞共同推展「海空貨物聯運」，結合香港航空物流優勢和東莞土地及人力資源優勢，大大提高跨境航空貨物中轉的效率。

此外，在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》，也就是CEPA框架下的《服務貿易協定》第二份修訂協議，已在今年三月實施。協議支持落實「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」在大灣區多個城市擴展；同時進一步為香港企業和專業人士開闢更廣闊的空間，拓展內地市場。

在金融方面，「跨境理財通」措施自啓動以來持續發展和優化、新推出的「跨境支付通」聯通兩地支付系統，奠定了粵港澳金融合作發展的基石，進一步促進大灣區市場一體化建設。

展望未來，香港會繼續積極推動粵港澳三地高水平互聯互通，深化三地的規則銜接和機制對接，促進人流、物流、資金流、信息流的高效流動。香港會攜手各大灣區城市，為國家的強國建設、民族復興偉業作出更大、更新的貢獻。

今天的大會以「賦能大灣區共拓新機遇」為主題，聚焦國際供應鏈協同創新、全球貿易風險應對、跨境金融合作、商事法律合作和人工智能產業等議題進行深入探討，團結灣區力量應對當前全球經貿格局的挑戰，意義重大。

我期待各位工商界的朋友在大會中就大灣區高質量發展建言獻策，共同為大灣區建設注入新動能，開拓更多新機遇。

最後，我祝願本次工商大會圓滿成功，國家發展繁榮昌盛，大灣區發展欣欣向榮！謝謝大家。"

文化體育及旅遊局局長出席「第十五屆全國運動會香港賽區義工計劃」誓師典禮致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-09-14 19:36,2025-09-14 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400574.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（九月十四日）出席「第十五屆全國運動會香港賽區義工計劃」誓師典禮的致辭全文：

Raymond（香港賽馬會公司事務執行總監譚志源）、黃江天先生（義務工作發展局副主席）、郭永亮先生（香港志願者協會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位義工朋友：

大家下午好。今日很開心，其實這個已是我今日出席的第三個與體育有關的活動，但來到這裏仍然非常興奮，因為見到大家。今日是第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會和第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）香港賽區義工誓師典禮。今日的典禮標誌着超過16 000位義工正式獲得委任，組成一支香港歷來最大的義工團隊，為即將到來的全運會服務。

十五運會和殘特奧會，大家都知道是首次由粵港澳三地共同承辦。而香港特區能夠承辦，既是國家對我們的信任與認可，也體現香港積極融入國家發展大局。

剛才播放的短片，大家可能找到自己出現在片段，但將來你們會在更多影片、更多場合出現。剛才回顧了我們自去年七月開始，招募、遴選和培訓義工的過程。我們現在組成這支龐大的義工團隊，有超過1 000位是15至17歲的青少年朋友，這裏有沒有15至17歲的義工？還是今日大人多些？拍手的我也視你為15至17歲，心態年輕便行了，對吧？另外，在15 000位成人義工當中，有學生、在職朋友、家庭主婦、銀髮一族及已退休的朋友，其中最年長的一位已年過80歲。這一方面體現了香港的確是個很長壽的城市，80歲也做全運會義工；第二方面體現了無論是甚麼年齡和背景，只要大家都抱持相同理念和熱誠去服務，都可以用實際行動支持十五運會和殘特奧會這兩項國家體育盛事。

隨着義工朋友正式獲得委任，我希望大家以最真誠態度參與義工服務，尊重及遵守義工守則，全力支持十五運會和殘特奧會。正如今屆志願服務口號「為你，更精彩」所傳遞的信息一樣，透過你們每一位的參與，將令十五運會和殘特奧會更加精彩。你們的使命不僅在於為賽事提供支持，更重要在於用你們的笑容、細心與專業展示香港最美好的一面，讓從全國各地來到參賽的運動員和觀賽的觀眾感受到香港的好客之道。我曾說過，希望香港人人都是旅遊大使，16 000位義工就是香港「排頭兵」的旅遊大使，我們的希望就在大家身上。我也希望透過今次的好客之道，將香港更進一步融入大灣區，作出更大貢獻。

在此，我要特別感謝香港賽馬會。香港賽馬會是香港賽區的唯一合作夥伴，提供4億5 000萬元贊助以支持賽事的籌辦，而其中約1億2 100萬元將用於義工計劃，包括義工培訓、開發信息管理系統、津貼、膳食，以及大家今日所穿、很漂亮的制服等。除提供資助外，大家今日都見到馬會的朋友，包括譚（志源）總監，都穿了一件很醒目的紅色衣服，這件紅色衣服是馬會義工隊的制服。馬會義工隊亦參與我們的義工團隊，在不同崗位為十五運會和殘特奧會提供服務，我們衷心感謝馬會的鼎力支持。

同時，我也要感謝義務工作發展局和香港志願者協會兩間協作機構。他們在過去一年多以來，策劃和推展整個義工計劃，勞苦功高。大家剛才所見的義工招募、培訓，以及義工的調配和管理，為我們整個義工團隊提供堅實的支援，確保每位義工朋友都能發揮最大潛力。

最後，大家剛才都看到，評審其實是一項很艱辛的工作，有時可能悶悶的，也肯定需要很多精神。我要衷心感謝近200位義務評審以及所有參與義工計劃的團體，他們在很短的時間內，會見三萬多名個人及團體義工申請人，從中選出最合適的這16 000位義工，協助組成我們這支充滿幹勁和熱誠的義工團隊。

各位義工朋友，包括今日在座的，以及未必在我們當中但一定會看到這個典禮的，或稍後會聽到這個信息的各位義工朋友，今日的授旗與宣誓不僅僅是一個儀式，更是一份承諾、一份榮譽。外面的裝置其實有你們的名字，每一位朋友的名字都印了出來，名字在上面，是一份你們應該得到的榮耀。成功舉辦大型盛事，絕對有賴你們的參與和付出，希望我們攜手努力，將這場屬於國家、屬於香港，也屬於每一位市民的體育盛事辦得更加精彩！多謝大家。"

They will form the largest-ever volunteer team in Hong Kong, providing services across various roles for the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG. These roles cover services for arrival, departure and hotel reception, spectator services, guest reception, anti-doping support and presentation ceremony support etc.

The ceremony was held at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium. The officiating guests included the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law; the Permanent Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Ms Vivian Sum; the Head of the NGCO, Mr Yeung Tak-keung; the Executive Director, Corporate Affairs, the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Raymond Tam; Vice-Chairman of the Agency for Volunteer Service Dr James Wong, and the Chairman of the Hong Kong Volunteers Association, Mr Andy Kwok. At the ceremony, nearly 1 800 volunteer representatives took an oath under the witness of officiating guests, committing to upholding their services at the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG with dedication. They were presented with flags. The gold medallist in the Women's Individual Épée event at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games and a member of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Volunteer Team, Vivian Kong, and former Hong Kong athlete, Leung Kwok-shing, were appointed as the Volunteer Ambassadors at the ceremony.

Speaking at the ceremony, Miss Law said that the volunteer team comprises more than 1 000 youths aged 15 to 17, together with over 15 000 adult volunteers from diverse age groups and backgrounds, the eldest being over 80 years old. They share the same philosophy and passion for services to support the two national mega sports events with devoted actions. She also expressed gratitude to the Hong Kong Jockey Club for its sponsorship in supporting the organisation of the competition events, including volunteer training, development of the information management system, allowances, catering, and uniforms. She also thanked the Agency for Volunteer Service and the Hong Kong Volunteers Association for planning and implementing the entire volunteer programme, including recruitment and training, thereby providing solid support to the entire volunteer work.

The first performance at the event was a Combi Latin Dance 3-Dance by Hong Kong wheelchair dancers Matthew Yu and Pandora Choi, who had just won gold medals in the Combi Latin Dance 3-Dance and 5-Dance competitions at the mass participation para dance sport competition of the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG. The Hong Kong Dance Company performed ""Fencing"", a dance inspired by the elite sport of fencing. Fencer Ryan Choi and table tennis athlete Doo Hoi-kam shared how volunteers assisted athletes during international competitions, enabling them to focus on their performance. Ryan Choi also sang live to encourage the volunteers who will be serving at the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG.

The volunteer nickname of the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG is Little Dolphin, signifying that volunteers from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao are friendly, lovely, motivated, intelligent and united like dolphins. The volunteer service slogan is ""Be more wonderful for you"". While ""you"" represents the events of the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG, as well as everyone who witnesses, participates in and supports the Games, ""wonderful"" is one of the requirements for hosting the Games. It also embodies athletes' excellent performances and volunteers' contributions to the Games.

The first batch of tickets for the Hong Kong competition region of the 15th NG, covering four competition events, namely beach volleyball, handball (men), basketball (men's U22) and rugby sevens, went on sale late last month. The second batch of tickets, covering the remaining four competition events, namely track cycling, golf, triathlon and fencing, will be available for sale in late September. For ticket purchases and competition schedules, please visit the 15th NG official ticketing website (ticket.baygames.cn).

黃國興致辭時表示，懲教署自二○○八年推行「更生先鋒計劃」以來，積極推動社區教育，並於二○一八年成立青少年制服團隊「更生先鋒領袖」，舉辦多元化社區教育活動及訓練。為強調與懲教署的關係，並彰顯其獨有專業特色，兩者分別易名為「懲教先鋒計劃」及「懲教先鋒領袖」，標誌着署方在社區教育上邁進新里程。

此外，署方今日亦為「懲教先鋒領袖」學員舉辦升級禮。本年度，64名學員憑着多年來的出色表現並通過嚴格的考核後獲晉升，當中三名學員晉升為高級領袖、八名晉升為中級領袖，以及53名晉升為進階領袖。黃國興祝賀獲晉升的學員，並期望他們能以學長身分薪火相傳，帶領新成員共同成長，發揮團隊精神，為社會貢獻力量。

典禮上，多名領袖學員分享參與計劃的得着。他們表示訓練讓他們拓展視野、發掘潛能，更立志未來積極回饋社會，推廣共融與守法價值，共建更美好香港。

為配合「懲教先鋒領袖」的長遠發展，署方今年委任15名來自懲教署不同組別、具備專業技能或青年工作經驗的懲教人員擔任義務導師，為團隊注入新動力，以推動計劃邁向專業及系統化發展。

隨着「懲教先鋒計劃」及「懲教先鋒領袖」正式啓動，懲教署將繼續透過多元化活動，向青少年傳遞「愛護家國、奉公守法、遠離毒品、支持更生」的重要信息。"

Addressing the ceremony, Mr Wong said that since the launch of the Rehabilitation Pioneer Project (RPP) in 2008, the CSD has been dedicated to promoting community education. In 2018, the youth uniformed group Rehabilitation Pioneer Leaders (RPL) was established, for which diverse community education activities and trainings were organised. To emphasise their relationship with the CSD and highlight their unique professional characteristics, the RPP and RPL were renamed as the Correctional Services Pioneer Project (CSPP) and CSPL respectively, representing a new chapter in the Department's community education initiatives.

Moreover, the Department also hosted a promotion ceremony for CSPL trainees today. With their outstanding performances over the years, 64 trainees were promoted this year following the completion of stringent assessments. Among them, three trainees were promoted to Senior Leaders, eight were promoted to Intermediate Leaders, and 53 were promoted to Advanced Leaders. Mr Wong extended his congratulations to the promoted trainees and encouraged them to pass on their knowledge and experiences to new members, guiding new recruits in their collective development, fostering team spirit, and contributing to society.

At the ceremony, CSPL trainees shared their experiences from participating in the programme. They mentioned that the training broadened their horizons and helped them discover their potential. They aspired to actively give back to society, promote the values of inclusiveness and being law-abiding, and work together to build a better Hong Kong.

To support the long-term development of the CSPL, the CSD appointed 15 correctional officers from various sections of the Department with specialised skills or experiences in youth work this year to serve as volunteer mentors. This initiative aims to inject new momentum into the programme, driving the programme toward professional and systematic development.

With the official launch of the CSPP and CSPL, the CSD will continue to, through organising diverse activities, disseminate to young people the messages of safeguarding the country and home, leading a law-abiding and drug-free life as well as supporting offender rehabilitation."
Hong Kong Customs detects drug trafficking case involving incoming passenger at airport (with photo),2025-09-14 18:24,2025-09-14 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400419.htm,"âHong Kong Customs detected a drug trafficking case involving an incoming air passengers at Hong Kong International Airport today (September 14) and seized about 25 kilograms of suspected cocaine with an estimated market value of about $18 million.

The case involved a 38-year-old male passenger arriving in Hong Kong from New York, United States, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cocaine from his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

After an investigation, the arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug and the case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (September 15).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-14 18:06,2025-09-14 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400573.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 14), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

The case involves a 46-year-old female living in Tung Chung. Preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Jiangmen in Guangdong on September 6, during which she was bitten by mosquitoes. She returned to Hong Kong on the same day. She developed a fever, joint pain and a rash from September 11. She went to Jiangmen on the same day and attended a local hospital there before returning to Hong Kong on September 12. She attended Queen Elizabeth Hospital on September 13 and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing by the Hospital Authority.

  Four people who accompanied the patient to Jiangmen on September 6 and another household contact of her (who did not travel to Jiangmen with her) are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

  Since the patient stayed in Jiangmen during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 17 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 201 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (September 7 to 13), similar to the previous two weeks, which reported 178 cases (August 31 to September 6) and 225 cases (August 24 to 30) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other regions that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, etc. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also the Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-14 17:29,2025-09-14 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/14/P2025091400559.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月十四日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。

最新個案資料

病人為46歲女子，住所位於東涌。初步調查顯示，她於九月六日到訪廣東省江門市，期間曾被蚊叮咬，同日回港。她由九月十一日開始出現發燒、關節痛和皮疹，同日前往江門當地的醫院求醫，翌日（九月十二日）回港，於九月十三日到伊利沙伯醫院求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。醫院管理局的化驗結果顯示她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

與病人於九月六日同行到江門的四名人士，及病人的另一名家居接觸者（沒有同行到江門市），現時都沒有出現病徵，全部正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期曾身處江門市，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，均屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得17宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（九月七日至十三日）廣東省新增201宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別178宗（八月三十一日至九月六日）及225宗（八月二十四日至三十日）相若。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。雖然廣東省基孔肯雅熱的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
