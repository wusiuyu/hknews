Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-27 17:30,2025-09-27 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700665.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 27), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 23 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Youth members from Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Macao reflected on their experiences and learning outcomes over the past year and gave presentations on various research topics. They also outlined the development of the Leaders Forum for the coming year, along with its new members.

Addressing the audience, the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, said the Leaders Forum has organised nearly 30 diversified events over the past year, covering areas including patriotic education, national security, technology, culture and career exploration. As this year marks the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, the Leaders Forum also arranged for youth members to visit the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders in Nanjing, enabling them to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of safeguarding national sovereignty and security. He said he was glad to see that the Leaders Forum strives to further deepen regional co-operation, he said that apart from continuing to maintain close collaboration with Shenzhen University, the Leaders Forum also partnered with the Academy of Public Security Forces of Macao for the first time, with a view to jointly promoting interaction and exchanges among young people in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Macao.

Youth members from the three places shared their observations and reflections from the activities of the Leaders Forum in the past year through interviews and short videos, including their experiences gained from the summer internships at various renowned enterprises and government agencies. Youth members gave presentations on various youth-related research topics, including public engagement, promotion of Chinese culture, cyber ethics and civic responsibilities, telling good stories of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and social responsibilities of youth. The members received feedback from the guests. Old and new members then participated in team-building activities to know each other through games, laying a solid foundation for collaborative learning in the coming year.

Concluding the event, the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, highlighted the significant achievements of the members of the Leaders Forum last year. These included four members representing Hong Kong youth to attend the military parade in commemoration of the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War in Beijing; a member, as the youth representative of Hong Kong, China, taking part in the Voices of the Future programme organised by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Peru in 2024; and seven members being awarded the stars of self-improvement of Chinese college students, an award presented to only 20 students in Hong Kong. Mr Tang added that 42 members did summer internships in renowned enterprises or organisations in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hong Kong and Macao, and 10 students from Shenzhen University came to Hong Kong for training in different enterprises.

Mr Tang said that in order to strengthen the core objectives of co-operation in the GBA, the SB will assign five Administrative Officers, together with five teachers from Shenzhen University, to serve as mentors for the new cohort of members, guiding new members to complete thematic research projects related to GBA collaboration. He also said that the alumni of the Leaders Forum are actively preparing for the establishment of an alumni association, in the hope of bringing the sense of social responsibility and collaborative spirit they have learned to more social service activities, becoming a group that can contribute to Hong Kong and the country.

The SB established the Leaders Forum in October 2022 to deepen participation in youth work. In the following year, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Shenzhen University, and its students were invited to participate in the activities of the Leaders Forum. Last year, the Leaders Forum expanded its network by including youth members of the Academy of Public Security Forces of Macao, further promoting youth development and cultural exchanges among Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Macao."

保安局局長鄧炳強作總結發言時表示，過去一年「領袖論壇」成員亦取得不少成果，包括四人代表香港青年出席在北京舉行的抗日戰爭勝利80周年閱兵、一人作為中國香港青年代表赴秘魯參加2024年亞太經濟合作組織「未來之聲」計劃、七人榮獲只有20個香港地區名額的「中國大學生自強之星」等。另外，今年暑假有42位成員到知名企業或者機構實習，實習地點遍布北京、上海、南京、深圳、珠海、香港、澳門等地；亦有深圳大學10位同學來港到不同企業體驗培訓。

鄧炳強表示，為進一步強化大灣區合作的核心目標，保安局未來會派出五位政務主任，聯同五位來自深圳大學的教師，共同成為新一屆學員的輔導員，指導他們完成與大灣區合作領域有關的專題研究。他亦指部分「領袖論壇」學長正積極籌備成立學長會，期望將他們所學的社會責任感、協同合作力帶到更加多社會服務活動，成為能貢獻香港及國家的團體。

保安局於二○二二年十月成立「領袖論壇」，深化青年工作。翌年與深圳大學簽訂合作備忘錄，邀請該校同學參加「領袖論壇」的活動，去年更加入澳門保安部隊高等學校學員，進一步擴大「領袖論壇」的協作網絡，促進港深澳三地青年發展和文化交流。"

民政及青年事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-09-27 16:01,2025-09-27 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700574.htm,"​以下是民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（九月二十七日）出席香港．青年發展高峰論壇上午環節後會見傳媒的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長︰大家好。民政及青年事務局（民青局）今日舉辦第二屆青年發展高峰論壇，論壇以「聯通世界跨越未來」為主題，是二○二五年「青年節@HK」的其中一項亮點活動。很高興今早政務司司長為我們主持了開幕環節，分享香港在青年發展上的工作方針和願景。今早的主題演講以「青年共創新力量」為主題。我們很高興可以邀請到來自國家、馬來西亞、沙特阿拉伯王國、老撾人民民主共和國、哈薩克斯坦共和國，以及聯合國教育、科學及文化組織，主管青年政策及推動青年發展的主要領導官員發表主題演講，分享青年人在推動社會發展中所擔當的重要角色，以及各地政府在促進青年發展方面的工作和政策。

今次論壇反應很熱烈，登記參加者人數超過3 000人，亦有約600位來自不同國家、城市和國家不同城市的青年來參加。這些青年朋友來自美國、馬來西亞、老撾、沙特阿拉伯、卡塔爾和國家不同城市。大家就青年關心的議題與本地青年交流和互相學習。下午還設有三場專題論壇，我們一共邀請了10多位來自不同地區的業界翹楚和社會領袖擔任演講嘉賓，他們會就科技創新、文化創意及迸發青年潛能等議題與青年分享和交流，當中更會有兩個奧運金牌運動員和大家分享。我希望參與今次論壇的青年朋友能夠把握這個跨地域的交流平台相互交流，豐富自己的體驗，並且認識香港的發展機遇，以自己所長，成為社會的參與者和貢獻者。

除了今日的論壇外，民青局亦特意為內地不同城市及海外參加者安排了一個為期三日的本地考察和交流活動，由昨日（九月二十六日）已開始，直至明日（九月二十八日）。我們會帶參加者參觀香港數碼港、香港科技園、大館、香港故宮文化博物館、海洋公園去探望熊貓、還有天壇大佛和一些青年人喜歡去的「蒲點」，亦會去一些充滿本土特色的地方，例如南豐紗廠，以增強他們對香港科技創新、文化藝術和古蹟保育等方面的認識。民青局「連青人網絡」幹事會成員和「YDC青年大使計劃」的參加者會成為交流大使，與來自內地及海外的青年朋友一同探索香港，促進互動交流，全方位推廣香港，向世界說好香港故事。

民青局作為負責青年工作的政策局，我們會繼續凝聚社會各界力量，攜手推動青年發展，亦會繼續透過舉辦論壇、各個青年內地交流和實習計劃、不同的青年活動，培養年輕人。剛才提到我們會繼續凝聚社會各界力量，在此我要特別感謝，能舉辦今次論壇，背後有很多機構、組織和參與不同青年工作的朋友。他們無論在提供資源、資金，以及工作上、組織上的協調，都給予我們大力支持。這讓人看到香港的青年朋友是非常優秀，而社會各界都願意攜手為青年朋友創造更多機會和發展平台。

​記者：局長，可否說一下今次颱風下關愛隊的工作？疏散了多少居民到不同的庇護中心呢？另外，第一期關愛隊服務已完結，第二期會開始。第一期關愛隊的績效何時會公布予公眾？第二期未來工作有甚麼展望呢？

民政及青年事務局局長：首先，我要感謝各地區的義工朋友、關愛隊成員和義工、區議員、地區「三會」成員，不少社區組織，甚至有些中資機構，他們都提供了很大協助，預防這個超強颱風和之後的工作。上星期開始，當我們知道這個颱風將會很猛烈時，政務司司長已經統籌了不同部門，超前部署做各項預備工作，包括出動關愛隊、區議員和「地區」三會成員到那些可能會受水浸影響的低窪地區，特別是一些偏遠的鄉村，呼籲市民做好防風準備，也提醒他們要及時疏散。

大澳有很多村民，有義工協助他們將傢俬及時升高，亦呼籲他們有需要時疏散到臨時庇護中心。臨時庇護中心一般是在八號風球之下才開放，但當時我們已提早在星期二（九月二十三日）早上八時開放，因為我們想方便居民在還沒大風大雨時，可以及早安全地到臨時庇護中心休息。同時，臨時庇護中心一般是在八號風球除下後便關閉，但當時考慮到天氣不穩定，我們將臨時庇護中心的開放時間延長直到三號風球除下，天氣穩定了才關閉。在這段時間我們總共開放了50個臨時庇護中心，有超過900個市民使用。為甚麼開50個中心呢？因為有些在水浸影響的低窪地區，我們希望方便居民如要疏散到臨時庇護中心時，可以鄰近他們。我們很感謝地區裏不同的學校借出校舍，也有教會組織借出教會作臨時庇護中心，當然不少得的是鄉事委員會，也借出了鄉事委員會的地方，亦動員了鄉事委員會村長、村民，一同協助進行疏散工作。

至於疏散了多少市民，數量也挺多。舉例說我們在沙頭角中心小學設立了臨時庇護中心，為甚麼我們會那裏設立？因為在小學的對面，一條馬路之隔有一間老人院位處低窪地區，曾經在颱風山竹和天鴿時遭受水浸，老人院的院友當時亦要緊急撤離。所以這次我們提早部署，也感謝學校提早借出學校，讓我們可以提早協助老人院疏散二十幾位長者。老人院的疏散不同一般疏散行動，因為老人家需要有自己的床，我們要協助拆卸床，關愛隊的隊員、鄉事會的村民和義工朋友，要逐張拆卸婆婆公公在老人院的床，將床送到臨時庇護中心再安裝。老人家在這所學校臨時中心住了兩日，然後我們再陪他們返回老人院，協助還原在老人院內的床。所以我們在這裏做了很多大型工作。

又例如在深井村，在星期三水位高的時候，我們透過民政處協調關愛隊，在暴風前，已經收集了一些村民資料，所以當我們呼籲他們疏散，那天早上水位很高時，我們已經不停聯絡那些村民。

我們亦感謝民安隊和消防員，因有些村民行動不太方便，有些是要推輪椅，甚至有些是要揹他們去到當時的學校。當時深井有一間學校借了地方來做臨時庇護中心，所以其實我們做了很多工作。

反而有些村這次疏散不多，因為我們在之前做了一些防水工作。舉例在大埔的美援新村，美援新村也是一個位於低窪的鄉村，曾經因水浸受到很嚴重的影響。當我們知道這個暴風來臨前，大埔區議員、關愛隊的成員和義工，大家知道會在星期二下午懸掛八號風球後，已在星期一下午買了一些建築材料和板，幫二十多戶居民造好臨時擋水板，工作至星期一晚上，我們很感謝他們的努力。最終村民告訴我們，這些臨時的設施發揮了作用，讓他們的家不受水浸影響，之後亦有發短訊多謝區議員和關愛隊的成員。所以在這次工作上，我們看到在社會上，大家都是群策群力，而在星期二和三，關愛隊和區議員一直提供消息，看到哪裏有塌樹就會馬上透過我們的網絡通知（民政事務）專員，聯絡相關部門及時清理。所以在八號風球後，大家看到我們很快便清理了一些阻路的塌樹。我們很感謝市民的支持和配合政府的工作，亦要多謝不同的機構、關愛隊、區議會，以及社區的力量，大家一起眾志成城，一起做好這次工作。

至於你問關愛隊第二期，其實關愛隊的第一期還未完結。當關愛隊的第一期完結之後，他們會按我們的要求，需要交一個工作報告，我們收齊和整理後，會讓公眾看到關愛隊過去一期的工作成果。而第二期關愛隊的工作，我們也希望能無縫與第一期交接，因為大家看到，無論是颱風或是之前在東區的炸彈發現事件，關愛隊和義工在社區都付出了很大力量。我們很希望第二期和第一期能夠無縫交接，不會影響社區的服務。"

Dorian (Founding Chairman of the Asian New Generation Creativity Design Association, Mr Dorian Ho), fashion designers from both Hong Kong and Korea, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello). Good afternoon. It is my tremendous pleasure to join you for LOCAL POWER 2025 Hong Kong Fashion in Seoul. Thank you for joining us today, gathering here to witness the magic of fashion design and its power to foster cultural exchange and friendship between Hong Kong and Korea.

As the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, I have been eagerly anticipating today's event. I actually had a preview earlier this month at Hong Kong's own CENTRESTAGE fashion gala, and I was deeply impressed. Today's full showcase promises to be even more captivating, featuring over 70 unique designs from 30 emerging designers and brands from Hong Kong and other cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area), alongside five of Korea's top designers.

But LOCAL POWER 2025 is more than just a fashion show. It is an exciting, interactive experience, enhanced by artificial intelligence and brought to live with live Cantopop and K-pop performances. Through this hybrid showcase, you will get a true taste of Hong Kong's vibrant and diverse creative industries.

This event is a perfect example of our commitment, as outlined in our Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, to strengthen the arts and creative ecosystem in Hong Kong. With Hong Kong's unique role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, we are proud to sponsor projects like this through our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency, CCIDA. Our goal is to present our new generation of Greater Bay Area fashion design talents to the world, enhance their international exposure and help build powerful local brands.

As a key part of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul, this groundbreaking collaboration provides a creative platform for elite designers from Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area and Korea. It elevates our cultural and creative partnership to the next level. 

Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul was officially launched yesterday, bringing 14 selected programmes - about 65 performances and activities - to Korea, from dance and music to film, Chinese painting and comics. Your participation here today provides the momentum to further connect the creative talents of Hong Kong and Korea.

Speaking of connection, I would like to extend an invitation to you all. This coming November to December, Hong Kong will be hosting the Hong Kong Fashion Fest. As our Chief Executive outlined in his Policy Address, our vision is to develop Hong Kong into Asia's leading fashion design hub. The Hong Kong Fashion Fest is our annual spotlight event, a spectacular tapestry of design happenings across the city. This year, we are taking it a step further by collaborating with Paris and Milan Fashion Weeks to promote digital and sustainable fashion. I sincerely welcome all of you to join us in Hong Kong for this extravaganza. Please stay tuned for details.

Before I close, I must express my heartfelt appreciation to the Asian New Generation Creativity Design Association and Dorian himself, for organising this project. And my gratitude also goes to today's performing artists, Mr Chu Wan-pin, and Shownu and Hyungwon of MONSTA X, as well as various supporting organisations.

I wish LOCAL POWER 2025 Hong Kong Fashion in Seoul a roaring success, and all the participating designers a rewarding and inspiring journey fashion show and the exhibition that follows.

Thank you. Kamsahamnida (Korean: Thank you)."

第四屆粵港澳大灣區統計論壇圓滿舉行 （附圖）,2025-09-27 13:30,2025-09-27 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092500994.htm,"第四屆粵港澳大灣區統計論壇昨日（九月二十六日）以線上直播形式舉行。在國家統計局指導下，論壇由廣東省統計局主辦，並由廣州市統計局和廣州市黃埔區人民政府聯合承辦。政府統計處處長余振強與數名該處專業統計人員一同參與這項一年一度的盛事。

今年論壇的主題為「粵港澳大灣區統計創新與技術突破」，旨在促進粵港澳大灣區統計交流合作，讓「9+2」城市的統計專業人員可以集思廣益，以創新思維推動統計方法與技術的革新，攜手應󠇡對當前複雜多變的環境。除了國家統計局和廣東省統計局的領導參與，論壇亦匯聚了不同範疇的統計專家，包括來自粵港澳大灣區「9+2」城市的政府統計機構代表，以及中國內地高等院校和研究機構代表。

余振強在論壇開幕式致辭時表示，在推進統計改革與創新的道路上，統計處一直秉持「守正創新、先立後破」的工作方針。在堅守統計專業精神、保持客觀中立、尊重私隱和保障數據安全的前提下，他鼓勵同事勇於突破框架、積極擁抱新技術、追求卓越，持續提升工作成本效益和服務質量。

余振強亦闡述在當前瞬息萬變的數字時代，人工智能已經不單是一種工具，更是一股正在深刻改變工作方式和思維模式的強大力量。在統計領域中，海量數據的搜集、處理、分析和解讀往往耗時費力，而人工智能可以高效完成重複性的工作，釋放團隊更多精力和時間，專注於策略研判與創新應用。因此人工智能不但不會取代專業統計人員，反而會成為團隊中不可或缺的「新成員」，有效提升處理和分析數據的能力。

政府統計處高級統計師陳志豪亦在論壇中一個環節發表題為「數據科學在官方統計工作中的應用策略」的專題演講。參與論壇的統計處人員均表示，是次論壇讓他們了解到中國內地的統計技術正不斷深化，提醒他們在日新月異的大數據時代更要勇於創新和積極尋求突破，以迎接未來的機遇和挑戰。

是次論壇以線上形式舉辦，來自北京、廣東省、香港及澳門等的統計機構均有代表參與。大灣區各城市統計系統的相關人員，以及國家級智庫和知名高校專家學者，亦就數據科學技術的應用、統計人才培育、統計改革創新、經濟監測和預測等課題分享真知灼見。"

While upholding the spirit of professionalism in statistics, maintaining objectivity and neutrality, respecting privacy and ensuring data security, he encourages his colleagues to boldly break boundaries, actively embrace new techniques, strive for excellence, and continuously enhance the work cost-effectiveness and service quality.

Mr Yu also remarked that in today's rapidly changing digital era, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer merely a tool but a powerful force profoundly transforming our ways of working and thinking. In the field of statistics, the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of massive data are often time-consuming and labour-intensive. AI can efficiently handle repetitive tasks, freeing up the team's energy and time to focus on strategic assessment and innovative applications. Therefore, instead of replacing statistical professionals, AI will become an indispensable ""new member"" of the team, by effectively enhancing the team's ability to process and analyse data.

Senior Statistician of the C&SD Mr Ronald Chan also delivered a presentation entitled ""Strategies for application of data science in official statistics"" at one of the sessions of the forum. The staff members of the C&SD who participated in the forum unanimously expressed that this forum enabled them to acquire insights into the ongoing advancement of statistical techniques on the Chinese Mainland, and reminded them to strive for innovation and actively pursue breakthroughs in the dynamic era of big data, so as to seize opportunities and tackle challenges in the future.

The forum, held online, was attended by representatives of statistical organisations from Beijing, Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macao, etc. Relevant officials from the statistical systems of the cities in the GBA, as well as experts and scholars from national think tanks and renowned universities, also shared their valuable insights on topics such as applications of data science techniques, development of statistical talent, statistical reform and innovation, economic monitoring and forecasting, etc."

HKO and National Time Service Center sign agreement to strengthen collaboration in time services (with photos),2025-09-27 13:15,2025-09-27 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092600360.htm,"The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and the National Time Service Center (NTSC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences signed the first co-operation agreement at the HKO Headquarters today (September 27) to enhance collaboration in time measurement, time-keeping and time services, as well as the exchange of related experiences and technologies.

 The agreement was signed by the Director of the HKO, Dr Chan Pak-wai, and the Director of the NTSC, Dr Zhang Shougang. The Secretary for Environment and Ecology of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Tse Chin-wan, witnessed the signing ceremony.

 At the signing ceremony, Dr Chan said, ""The HKO was set up in 1883. The provision of an accurate time service, particularly for mariners, has been one of its primary responsibilities since its establishment. From astronomical observations using the transit instrument at the beginning to the introduction of pendulum clocks in the 1920s, quartz-controlled timing systems in the 1960s, and then the adoption of the caesium beam atomic clock commencing in 1980, the Observatory's timing services have continuously developed with the times. Recognising that the NTSC is the official keeper of China's Atomic Time Standard and the developer of spaceborne atomic clocks, the platform for space-ground integrated satellite navigation time service, and the high-precision ground-based time service system, now is an opportune time to strengthen close collaboration between the HKO and the NTSC from a national strategic perspective.""

 Dr Zhang said, ""The NTSC is the only specialised and comprehensive research institute in China dedicated to both the foundational and applied research in time and frequency. We are responsible for generating, maintaining, and disseminating China's National Standard Time (Beijing Time). In recent years, the deviation between the National Standard Time generated and maintained by the NTSC and the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) has remained within two nanoseconds, achieving the highest accuracy internationally. Our contribution to the calculation of the International Atomic Time ranks second globally. The Center maintains a long-standing partnership with the HKO. This time, we will further deepen our co-operation with the Observatory. Through joint timekeeping, fibre-optic time service, data sharing, and other initiatives, we will work together to enhance the accuracy and reliability of time services in Hong Kong, jointly promote the development of integrated atomic time, and further enhance our country's capability to maintain the time standard.""

 Before the signing ceremony, both sides conducted a high-level meeting to discuss the short-term and long-term plans for collaboration in time service enhancement and the target objectives. The Observatory will deploy reliable equipment and methods to acquire multiple time sources from NTSC to further enhance the reliability and resilience of local time service provision. In addition to the continual participation in the determination of UTC by providing atomic clock time data to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France, the Observatory also plans to participate in the Joint Atomic Time System of China to jointly promote the development of integrated atomic time."
Speech by SHYA at Youth Development Summit (English only) (with photo),2025-09-27 13:02,2025-09-27 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700408.htm,"âFollowing is the speech by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, at the Youth Development Summit today (September 27):

President Xu (President of All-China Youth Federation, Mr Xu Xiao), Minister Yeoh (the Minister of Youth and Sports, Malaysia, Ms Hannah Yeoh), Deputy Minister AlMajed (the Deputy Minister of Society Development at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mr Ahmed Saleh AlMajed), Deputy Minister Keophilavong (the Deputy Secretary General of the Central Committee, Lao People's Revolutionary Youth Union, Mr Souliya Keophilavong), Vice Minister Kochetov (the Vice Minister of Culture and Information, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mr Yevgeniy Kochetov), Deputy Director-General Qu (the Deputy Director-General, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Dr Qu Xing), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all to the second edition of the Youth Development Summit, a vibrant gathering that celebrates the boundless potential of our youth under the inspiring theme of ""Connecting the World into the Future"". This theme captures our collective vision of empowering young people to forge connections across cultures and pave the way for a brighter, more interconnected tomorrow together. Last year, we launched this Summit with tremendous energy, with a view to sparking meaningful dialogues and a shared commitment to youth development as the cornerstone of the future of our city, our country and the world. This year, we take the next step together, building on that momentum to foster even deeper connections and opportunities for the next generation.

In this year's Government Work Report at the 14th National People's Congress, Premier Li Qiang called on Hong Kong to deepen international exchanges and co-operation. We embrace that call with concrete actions and plans. For our young people, it means opening doors to new horizons, where they can learn from the world and share Hong Kong's unique story with pride. For our city, it is a chance to cement our role as ""super connector"", bridging talent, ideas and aspirations across cultures and continents.

This very Summit is the embodiment of that spirit of connection and collaboration. We are joined today by distinguished officials, visionary leaders and innovators of different fields from around the globe, alongside youth delegates from diverse backgrounds. Together, you are the proof that when young minds come together, they ignite creativity, foster understanding, and drive innovation that transcends boundaries.

Central to our mission is the Youth Development Blueprint, which was released by my bureau in December 2022. Since its release, we have been taking forward youth development work alongside other policy bureaux, implementing at full steam some 160 measures set out in the Blueprint. Additionally, policy bureaux have introduced around 90 new measures to ensure that the Blueprint progresses with the times and is dynamic and responsive to the changing needs of our youth.

Across the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, bureaux and departments have various measures and initiatives in place to echo Premier Li's call, and I am proud to highlight some of our key initiatives today.

One of our core focuses is opening up the world to our youth through exchange and internship opportunities. In addition to establishing a foothold in Hong Kong, we encourage young people to explore the rich history, culture and opportunities of our country and beyond. Our multi-pronged approach ensures that young people from all walks of life can access these experiences at different stages of their development.

We offer diverse internship opportunities in the Chinese Mainland and overseas, helping young people gain hands-on insights into workplace cultures, set career goals and build networks. Last year, around 5000 young people took part in these programmes, ranging from working as interns inside world-class UNESCO heritage sites of the Palace Museum and Dunhuang Academy, to making meaningful contributions to international affairs through volunteer internships in the overseas field units of various United Nations agencies.

Beyond internships, we also have in place a wide spectrum of exchange programmes, deepening young people's understanding of our country and the world, as well as fostering meaningful exchanges between them and young people around the world. Last year, more than 30000 youth explored various provinces and cities in the Chinese Mainland, as well as 42 countries and regions across five continents. To ensure that grassroots youth would not be denied the opportunity to discover new horizons, we have especially launched a pilot scheme last year to provide additional subsidies for the underprivileged to participate in these exchange activities.

Looking ahead, as newly announced by our Chief Executive Mr John Lee in the 2025 Policy Address last week, we will launch a Young Talent Training Programme to expand opportunities for internships with international organisations and participation in global conferences. We will also introduce a new media thematic internship programme in the Chinese Mainland, which will further equip our youth to tell compelling stories on the global stage.

In addition to going global, we welcome with open arms young people from the Chinese Mainland and all over the world to visit Hong Kong. Last year, some 2800 youth participated in our inbound exchange projects. This year, we have rolled out a number of enhancement measures to further encourage two-way exchange projects, fostering dialogues and friendships between Hong Kong youth and their peers across the Chinese Mainland and globally.

The Youth Development Summit itself is a flagship event for promoting international youth exchange. For today's Summit, I am excited to share that we have gathered about 600 youth delegates from the Chinese Mainland and 33 countries. Aside from the Summit, we are also organising thematic visit programmes for them to explore Hong Kong together with local youth, which will enable them to learn more about Hong Kong's latest development in technological innovation, culture and arts, etc and promote cross-territory youth exchange.

Closer to home, we are creating vibrant spaces to spark creativity and connection. Last year, we unveiled plans to transform the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into the ""Youth Post"" hostel, a dynamic place in a beautiful setting near the Victoria Harbour, fostering cultural, arts and sports exchanges. Since its trial launch in July this year, the Youth Post has hosted exciting activities such as skateboarding performances, busking sessions, and concert after-parties tied to Kai Tak Sports Park. Some of the youth delegates joining us at this Summit are actually staying on-site, experiencing its vibrant atmosphere firsthand. With feedback from our youth, we are gearing up for its official opening this year. Over the next five years, the Youth Post plans to host around 100 diverse activities, offering affordable accommodation for youth visitors from the Chinese Mainland and abroad while fostering exchanges that inspire creativity.

Alongside promoting international youth exchange, youth engagement is also at the heart of our youth development efforts. Youth Link, a youth network we launched in September 2023, now connects over 18000 members. It bridges participants from various government youth programmes, offering them the opportunities to develop talents and build trust with the Government. Members have participated in Youth Dialogue sessions with senior government officials and outbound exchange tours, volunteered at major government events, and even attended international events. For example, several Youth Link members represented Hong Kong, China, at the official youth development programme under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) framework held in Peru in November last year, engaging in meaningful exchanges with peers across the region.

We are also expanding physical spaces for youth engagement. Youth Square, located in Chai Wan as a dedicated hub for youth development, provides a vibrant venue for young people to connect and learn through events and activities. By year-end, its first phase of renovations will unveil a new interactive space and video studio. Coupled with the ""Good Stories of Hong Kong Youth"" Programme, young people will create videos to share inspiring stories about Hong Kong, supported by training in production and filming. Similarly, in the dynamic district of Sham Shui Po, known for its rich cultural heritage and bustling creative energy, the renovations at the Nam Cheong District Community Centre and the adjacent Tung Chau Street Temporary Market will provide a lively hub for Youth Link members to connect and grow their networks. The first phase of the renovation works will be completed by the end of this year.

While our bureau spearheads many youth development initiatives, we work hand in hand with all bureaux to advance this shared mission. For example, the Education Bureau plays a vital role in broadening global horizons for students. Since the 2016/17 academic year, the Belt and Road Scholarship has encouraged outstanding students from 49 Belt and Road countries to pursue publicly-funded undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Hong Kong. Over 680 students have been awarded the scholarship to date. We are thrilled to have over 70 of these awardees with us at the Summit this morning, bringing diverse insights to our discussions. The Scheme for Subsidy on Exchange for Post-secondary Students, introduced in 2015 and later expanded to Belt and Road regions in 2016 and 2019, aids students in participating in international exchanges, internships, service programmes, and competitions, with 35 institutions participated in 2024/25. Furthermore, life-wide learning strategies, supported by a flexible curriculum and grants such as the Life-wide Learning and Sister School Grant and the Student Activities Support Grant, enable students from all backgrounds to engage in STEAM competitions and study tours outside ordinary classroom settings, cultivating informed and responsible global citizens.

Ladies and gentlemen, our young people are stepping into a world that is more interconnected yet more challenging than ever. Through these initiatives, we are equipping them not just to navigate this changing landscape but to shape it with confidence and purpose.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to the Youth Development Blueprint, scaling up partnerships and opportunities to make international exchange a transformative experience for the next generation. With the unique positioning of Hong Kong, anchored in our country and open to the world, we are determined to be the ""super connector"" our youth need. I invite you all to join us in this mission. Together, we can unlock endless possibilities for our young people and, in doing so, for our shared global future. Thank you."

尊敬的施子清博士、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興出席今天的「九十禮讚翰墨華章——施子清博士書法回顧展」，與大家一同欣賞施博士數十年來用心鑽研的書法造詣，感受中華傳統文化藝術的韻味和生命力。很多謝司儀剛剛很詳細介紹了施博士早年來到香港一直到現在如何為藝術、如何為香港作出巨大的貢獻，介紹得很詳細，而且不用看稿。

施子清博士自幼熱愛書法藝術，數十年來從未停筆，他的作品先後於北京、上海、香港、澳門、廈門等地展出，並獲得中國國家博物館收藏，可見施博士於書法界的崇高地位。

所謂「獨樂樂，不如眾樂樂」，多年來施博士帶領中國書協香港分會，致力於書法藝術的推廣和傳承，他親自編寫的《書法學習教程》，成功讓書法藝術走進年輕人和普羅市民的視野，發揮藝術薰陶人心的文明價值。我要衷心感謝施博士以及中國書協一直以來的努力和熱誠。

這次書法回顧展適逢施博士九十大壽，展出120件佳作，不但展示了書法藝術的技法，更呈現中華文明的精神與面貌。我知道，今次展覽是施博士與香港故宮文化博物館的再次合作，藉着香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的獨特地位，將書法這種中華文化獨有的藝術推廣開去，讓更多人能在欣賞書法作品的同時，加深認識中華文化源遠流長的歷史和思想內涵，細閱以筆墨書寫的中國好故事。

「文化藝術」是香港未來發展其中一個關鍵詞。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有的內聯外通優勢，不但成就香港成為連接國家與國際間經貿合作的雙向平台角色，更是促使中外文明交流的重要平台。

隨着內地和香港的文化交流日益緊密，我們將積極發揮香港中外文化匯聚的特色，讓中華文化從香港出發，走進國際舞台，提升中華文化的軟實力。

去年公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為香港文化藝術與創意產業的長遠發展指明方向。我們會舉辦及支持更多大型、多元的文化藝術活動和合作，為中外文化藝術交流搭建平台，推動中華優秀傳統文化的傳承與弘揚。

書法是中華文化的重要載體，承載着民族精神，也凝聚着文化自信。本屆政府全力推展愛國主義教育，在社會厚植愛國情懷，而文化自信和自豪感，正正是凝聚我們齊心貢獻國家，建設香港的精神命脈和力量泉源。

最後，我祝願這次巡迴展覽圓滿成功，期望大家從施博士的墨寶中，細味書法藝術的魅力，並透過筆墨之道，打開探索中華璀璨文化寶藏的大門。多謝大家。"

政務司司長出席「九十禮讚　翰墨華章----施子清博士書法回顧展」致辭（只有中文）,2025-09-27 12:36,2025-09-27 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700387.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（九月二十七日）出席「九十禮讚翰墨華章——施子清博士書法回顧展」的致辭：

尊敬的施子清博士、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興出席今天的「九十禮讚翰墨華章——施子清博士書法回顧展」，與大家一同欣賞施博士數十年來用心鑽研的書法造詣，感受中華傳統文化藝術的韻味和生命力。很多謝司儀剛剛很詳細介紹了施博士早年來到香港一直到現在如何為藝術、如何為香港作出巨大的貢獻，介紹得很詳細，而且不用看稿。

施子清博士自幼熱愛書法藝術，數十年來從未停筆，他的作品先後於北京、上海、香港、澳門、廈門等地展出，並獲得中國國家博物館收藏，可見施博士於書法界的崇高地位。

所謂「獨樂樂，不如眾樂樂」，多年來施博士帶領中國書協香港分會，致力於書法藝術的推廣和傳承，他親自編寫的《書法學習教程》，成功讓書法藝術走進年輕人和普羅市民的視野，發揮藝術薰陶人心的文明價值。我要衷心感謝施博士以及中國書協一直以來的努力和熱誠。

這次書法回顧展適逢施博士九十大壽，展出120件佳作，不但展示了書法藝術的技法，更呈現中華文明的精神與面貌。我知道，今次展覽是施博士與香港故宮文化博物館的再次合作，藉着香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的獨特地位，將書法這種中華文化獨有的藝術推廣開去，讓更多人能在欣賞書法作品的同時，加深認識中華文化源遠流長的歷史和思想內涵，細閱以筆墨書寫的中國好故事。

「文化藝術」是香港未來發展其中一個關鍵詞。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有的內聯外通優勢，不但成就香港成為連接國家與國際間經貿合作的雙向平台角色，更是促使中外文明交流的重要平台。

隨着內地和香港的文化交流日益緊密，我們將積極發揮香港中外文化匯聚的特色，讓中華文化從香港出發，走進國際舞台，提升中華文化的軟實力。

去年公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，為香港文化藝術與創意產業的長遠發展指明方向。我們會舉辦及支持更多大型、多元的文化藝術活動和合作，為中外文化藝術交流搭建平台，推動中華優秀傳統文化的傳承與弘揚。

Reporter: In the Policy Address, it says that six more Community Living Rooms (CLRs) will be set up in Hong Kong. Could you reveal when will the public could see these newly set up CLRs and when would the first one be opened according to the Government's timelines? And as for thosewhich have been in operation since 2023, does the Government intend to keep them running after the three-year program when it comes to an end?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. Right now we have nine CLRs in operation. In the Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced six more will be coming. So our plans for the coming year or so, at least six CLRs will be opened.

In terms of district, we believe we should be able to see CLRs in operation, say in the Yau Tsim Mong District, and also in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Ching. These are the areas we don't have any CLR right now. As for the existing CLRs, I think the concern is over the four CLRs that have been in operation for more than a year. In fact, for the first one in Shum Shui Po, it has been in operation more than one and a half year, so given the first agreement was that they would be provided free of charge for three years, it's inevitable that we are thinking about the renewal. We are grateful to the donors of these four CLRs, i.e. the Sino Group, the Henderson Land Group, and also the China Resources Group. They are going to provide another three years of extension of their leases. That means for these four CLRs will be provided to us free of charge together with the renovation cost for six years.

Reporter: So earlier in July, the Government has launched a pilot scheme in helping to identify families at risk. For example, when a caregiver has admitted to the hospital, the Hospital Authority (HA) would pass a message to the Social Welfare Department (SWD) who will reach out to the elderly in need. Would you also give us an update given that the program has been running for about two months now?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. Indeed, starting from mid-July this year, we are finally be able to make use of the big data available in the SWD, in the HA, and also in the Housing Department (HD). We are launching two pilots at the same time. The first one is through a data matching between the HA and the SWD. We started with around 10 000 people who were in receipt of the carer allowance schemes. Right now, we have received more than 500 alerts from the HA about the hospital admission of the carers. But only two cases require urgent support, including delivery of meal to their homes and also respite services.

Turning to another pilot we have been conducting right now is a data matching process to find out the singleton or doubleton elderly households held by the HD. We have been visiting more than 5 000 households, and out of these 5 000 households, around 400 are considered to be in need of further support. We have referred them to the relevant welfare associations and organisations to provide support and services later on."
Speech by CS at Youth Development Summit (English only) (with photos/video),2025-09-27 11:00,2025-09-27 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700320.htm,"âFollowing is the speech by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, at the Youth Development Summit today (September 27):

Distinguished guests and government officials from around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning, everyone! A heartfelt welcome to Hong Kong and this second edition of the Youth Development Summit.

  I spoke at last year's inaugural edition of the Summit and was delighted with the great turnout – innovators and change-makers taking part from all over the world.

  Well, this year's Summit, I'm happy to say, is even bigger, counting more than 3 000 young leaders. You're here from Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland, from East and Central Asia, the Middle East and beyond.

  And your presence here today is a testament to the growing eagerness of young people, worldwide, to come together and learn from one another, creating prospects for a more connected and prosperous global community. And this year's theme, ""Connecting the World into the Future,"" reflects that encouraging reality.

  Your participation highlights our shared commitment to promoting youth development – in Hong Kong, across the Belt and Road regions and around the world.

  The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government attaches great importance to youth. Our Youth Development Blueprint, released in late 2022, outlines our guiding principles for advancing youth development, as well as charting a clear pathway for stakeholders everywhere.

  Our vision is to nurture a new generation of youth equipped with a global perspective, a positive thinking mindset and an affection for our city and our country.

  Since the release of the Blueprint, more than 250 concrete actions and measures have been put forward, providing young people with wide-ranging opportunities and support.

  And just 10 days ago, the Chief Executive delivered his annual Policy Address. It includes a number of measures to promote youth development. Among them, a Young Talent Training Programme will expand opportunities for our youth to attend conferences and take part in the internships of international organisations.

  There will also be a new media thematic internship programme on the Mainland, a strengthened Youth Financial Education Programme, and new professional mediation workshops to help broaden young people's international perspectives and cultivate a global mindset.

  Exchange programmes for youth will also be stepped up, encouraging young people from overseas and the mainland to visit Hong Kong on exchange. Our Youth Post hostel, open now on a trial basis, officially opens later this year, providing affordable accommodation for young people, as well as a wide range of youth-focused activities and events. The goal is to encourage exchanges between Hong Kong youth and young visitors from around the world.

  This Summit is among the Youth Development Blueprint's initiatives. It brings together 20 prominent speakers, including young entrepreneurs, athletes, business professionals from I&T (Innovation and Technology) and the creative and service industries, and government and institutional leaders. I know their passion, experience and innovative insights will inspire us all.

  To you, our youth participants, this Summit is your Summit, yours to offer, and learn about, innovative solutions, create global connections and expand your horizons.

  The future belongs to you, and by taking part in today's Summit, you are one step closer to turning your ideas into tangible realities.

  Sports, and sportsmanship, is an integral element of youth – and this Summit. Sportsmanship encourages respect, fairness, integrity and teamwork.

  The 15th National Games will be held November 9 to 21, with Hong Kong hosting the Games together with Guangdong and Macao. Hong Kong will stage eight events: basketball, beach volleyball, fencing, golf, handball, rugby sevens, track cycling and triathlon.

  I invite you all to join us, in November, for this world-class sports competition, the many cultural events accompanying it and all the excitement of Hong Kong, Asia's world city.

  I am grateful to this year's Summit speakers, and to all of you, here in Hong Kong contribute your time, energy and ideas to create a better, more connected, world. Let us remember that lasting connectivity demands more than technology or infrastructure alone can offer. Empathy, understanding and a shared purpose, are no less essential.

  I am confident that, working together, we can empower a generation that is resilient, resourceful and ready to build a bright future for all.

  I wish all a rewarding Summit and an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, the world's East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

  Thank you very much."

Dr Tony Wong (Chairman of the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation), Mr Kim Dong-hwa (renowned Korean comics artist), esteemed comics artists from Hong Kong and Korea, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello). Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you for the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong Comics and Culture Exhibition. Today, we gather to unleash the unlimited potential of comic creations with our Korean friends and to strengthen the amicable ties between the cultural and creative industries of Hong Kong and Korea.

Comics are more than just a form of entertainment; they are a vibrant art form that captures our way of life, echoes our collective memories, and expresses our unique cultural identities. By showcasing the works of 19 Hong Kong comic artists across generations, alongside two internationally-acclaimed Korean comic artists, this exhibition initiates a powerful creative dialogue. It offers us all a wonderful opportunity to understand each other's lives and cultures more deeply.

Some of you may already be familiar with our classic, iconic characters like ""Old Master Q"" (èå¤«å­) and ""My Boy"" (çä»), who have won the hearts of generations around the globe. Today, we have brought a diverse collection of these and many more characters to meet our Korean friends. Our exhibits include exciting crossovers between contemporary comics, film, television, games, and art toys. I encourage you all to take your time to explore and enjoy the authentic humour and satirical wit of Hong Kong comics.

This exhibition is made possible with the support of my Bureau's Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and the tremendous efforts of the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation. The Federation's work is vital to our industry's growth. For instance, through its Hong Kong Comics Support Programme launched in 2021, we have nurtured new talents and publishing enterprises. This initiative has already led to the publication of 63 original comics and secured over 30 licensing agreements for foreign-language editions. This is a testament to the global appeal and competitiveness of Hong Kong, as it effectively expands their reach into overseas markets. Here today, you will see artworks from six of the award-winning artists of the Programme.

This exhibition is also a highlight of the Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul, which officially began last night. The week features 14 curated programmes with around 65 performances and activities. I sincerely hope that you will join us for these events and enjoy the array of arts and culture we have brought from Hong Kong to Korea.

In closing, I would like to congratulate the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation and all the talented comic artists from Hong Kong and Korea for making this exceptional exhibition a reality.

I wish the Hong Kong Comics and Culture Exhibition a resounding success and look forward to more fruitful collaborations between Hong Kong and Korea in the years to come.

Kamsahamnida (Korean: Thank you). Thank you."

獸醫管理局會繼續聆聽社會各界的意見，透過制訂和提升專業標準及獸醫註冊制度，保障動物的健康與福利及動物主人的利益。"
VSB enhances regulatory measures for registered veterinary surgeons,2025-09-27 10:37,2025-09-27 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092601131.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Veterinary Surgeons Board of Hong Kong:

The Veterinary Surgeons Board of Hong Kong (VSB) announced a series of measures to enhance the regulation of the veterinary practice of the registered veterinary surgeons (RVSs) and veterinary services in Hong Kong today (September 27).

The VSB has been closely monitoring public opinions in enhancing veterinary services. As the statutory body responsible for the regulation, registration, and disciplinary control of professional activities of RVSs, the VSB is committed to ensuring that veterinary services in Hong Kong are maintained at a high standard. After carefully gauging stakeholders' views, referencing practices from other regions, and balancing the needs of all parties, the VSB has introduced the following specific measures:

(1) Increasing the transparency of veterinary profession and enhancing the disciplinary inquiry arrangement


Extending publication periods of disciplinary orders: The VSB has extended the periods of publication of disciplinary orders made after March 26, 2025. The publication period for orders involving removal of names from the register of RVSs has been extended from one year to three years; and that for other orders, from one year to two years (both with the RVSs' names published). As regards publication of orders in an anonymised manner for educational purposes, the period has been extended from three years to indefinitely;




Providing guidance for disciplinary inquiries: A set of Inquiry Committee Guidance Manual has been compiled for reference by inquiry committees when adjudicating disciplinary inquiries against RVSs;




Mandating display of veterinarians' full names at clinics and name identification in medical records: RVSs (including locum RVSs) must display their full names prominently at the entrances or within the waiting areas of the clinics at which they practise. Additionally, the treating RVSs should be identified by name in the medical records of all consultations and procedures; and




Enhancing the reporting requirements for practising addresses: RVSs (including locum RVSs) are required to report their current regular or most regular practising addresses, enabling public access to current addresses at which RVSs primarily practise.


(2) Strengthening the regulation of the profession and public education


Introducing requirements on the use of complementary/alternative treatments and substances: RVSs must ensure that the use of complementary or alternative treatments and substances is in the animals' best interest and would yield equal or better results than the sole use of the available conventional treatments or medications for the condition concerned;




Introducing requirements on governing the use of telemedicine in veterinary practice: No veterinary service shall be provided using remote means of communication, unless the veterinary surgeon has conducted a physical examination of the animal within the preceding six months that reasonably suffices to enable the veterinary service to be provided without a further physical examination of the animal;




Suggested items in seeking clients' consent: A suggested items checklist was published for reference of the veterinary profession in seeking clients' consent in treatment and care of animals; and




Enhancing publicity of the types of veterinary service: Enhancing public education and publicity to help animal owners distinguish between general and specialised veterinary practices, enabling them to make informed choices about the services they need.


(3) Increasing understanding of the current situation and need for regulating the veterinary nursing profession


Survey on the veterinary nursing profession in Hong Kong: The VSB has launched a survey on the veterinary nursing professionin August this year, aiming to gather demographic information from RVSs, veterinary nursing practitioners (such as veterinary nurses, veterinary assistants, and veterinary technicians), as well as clinic owners. Information collected includes the number of practitioners engaged in veterinary nursing, their qualifications, areas of work, and their perspectives on regulation of the veterinary nursing profession.Based on analysis of the survey findings and with reference to the situations of the profession in Hong Kong and abroad, the VSB will explore the feasibility of establishing a regulatory framework for veterinary nursing practitioners.


Part of the above measures involve amendments to the Code of Practice for the Guidance of Registered Veterinary Surgeons and the Rules of the Veterinary Surgeons Board (Registration of Veterinary Surgeons). The VSB notified RVSs of the amendments in late August this year. The amendments will take effect from September 29, 2025 and will be available on the VSB's website (www.vsbhk.org.hk/english/rules/relevant.html). RVSs should read through and acquaint themselves thoroughly with the amendments thereby avoiding the danger of inadvertently transgressing accepted codes of professional ethical behaviour which may lead to disciplinary actions.

The VSB will continue to listen to views from various sectors of the community; and safeguard the health and welfare of animals and interests of animal owners, through the development and improvement of professional standards and registration of veterinary surgeons."
財經事務及庫務局局長在波蘭深入了解「出海」企業需要（附圖）,2025-09-27 10:00,2025-09-27 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092601183.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇在結束波蘭訪問前，到訪華沙證券交易所，並與波蘭官員和商界人士會面。他也參觀了一家在波蘭蒂黑設廠的內地企業，了解「出海」企業的需要。

許正宇九月二十五日（華沙時間）到訪華沙證券交易所，與行政總裁Tomasz Bardziłowski及其他管理層會面。華沙證券交易所由波蘭財政部創立，是中歐和東歐地區的主要金融產品交易所。

會面期間，許正宇向他們介紹了香港股市強勁的發展勢頭，包括今年首八個月的每日平均成交額達270億歐元，以及背後的政策支持。他表示，香港特別行政區政府致力於加強上市平台和證券市場的廣度和深度。行政長官在剛發表的二○二五年《施政報告》中宣布一系列旨在持續強化股票市場的新舉措，包括進一步完善主板上市和結構性產品發行機制，以及推動更多海外企業來港第二上市。華沙證券交易所認為內地與香港是現今經濟的增長引擎，許正宇期待與華沙證券交易所建立更多聯繫，令兩地股票市場更多元化，包括華沙證券所有興趣的現實世界資產代幣化。

隨後，許正宇與波蘭經濟發展及科技部副部長Michał Baranowski會面，向他介紹香港在財富管理和股票巿場的亮麗表現，以及各項推動金融增長的新措施，包括建立國際黃金交易巿場，當中涵蓋由政府牽頭的香港黃金中央清算系統。

他其後與波蘭財政部副部長Jarosław Neneman、國際稅務政策署署長Cezary Krysiak和國際合作署署長Paweł Siwek會面，要求將香港從波蘭的「採用損害性稅務措施的稅務管轄區名單」（名單）中剔除。許正宇強調，香港一直全力支持國際社會提升稅務透明度和打擊逃稅的工作，而經濟合作與發展組織亦沒有發現香港有任何損害性稅務措施。

波蘭財政部注意到在按請求交換資料方面，香港已獲稅務透明化及有效交換資料全球論壇評定為大致符合國際標準，而香港也不在歐洲聯盟的稅務合作事宜觀察名單上。在考慮各項相關因素後，波蘭財政部會積極考慮將香港從名單中剔除。

許正宇亦建議波蘭與香港早日就全面性避免雙重課稅協定（全面性協定）啓動磋商。雙方均認同兩地簽訂全面性協定對促進雙邊貿易大有裨益，實屬互惠互利。

下午，許正宇與波蘭外交部副部長Wojciech Zajączkowski會面，並向他提到在同日發布的第38期《全球金融中心指數》報告中香港穩居第三位，整體評分與位列第一的紐約和第二的倫敦的分數差距，分別收窄至2分和1分。在金融科技水平方面，香港躍升至第一位，而「營商環境」、「基礎設施」及「聲譽及綜合」方面也同樣升至全球第一。波蘭和香港在各自地區扮演門戶角色，兩地可以在多個領域合作，促進內地企業進入歐洲巿場，以及歐洲企業透過香港進入亞洲和中國巿場。

許正宇也出席了由中國建設銀行舉辦的商務午餐會，與已在歐洲開展業務的多家知名內地企業管理層會面。許正宇向他們保證，香港致力於成為「引進來、走出去」的平台，支持內地企業拓展海外業務。他指出，除了世界級的專業服務和完善的金融體系外，香港還有多方面的優勢可協助企業進一步拓展業務。

同日，許正宇也拜訪了中國駐波蘭大使館公使參贊李丹鴻，向她介紹香港金融環境的最新狀況。

許正宇九月二十六日（蒂黑時間）結束波蘭之行前，造訪了三花亞威科波蘭電器設備有限公司，與該公司的管理團隊會面，並參觀了該公司位於蒂黑的廠房。蒂黑廠房是該公司在歐洲三大主要生產基地中規模最大的。

在與三花集團三花歐洲平台總經理及財務中心總監姚彬和三花亞威科歐洲行政總裁劉世峰會面時，許正宇向他們詳細介紹了香港為協助內地企業通過香港「出海」而即將推出的各項舉措，以及現有的專業服務。他亦與三花管理層深入交流，以了解內地企業在拓展海外業務過程中所遇到的挑戰。

許正宇將於九月二十七日返抵香港。"
SFST gets better grasp of needs of companies go global in Poland (with photos),2025-09-27 10:00,2025-09-27 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092601192.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, visited the Warsaw Stock Exchange and met with Polish officials and members of the business sector in Warsaw, Poland before concluding his visit to the country. He also visited a Mainland enterprise which has set up factory facilities in Tychy, Poland, to learn about the needs of the go global companies.

  On September 25 (Warsaw time), Mr Hui visited the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) and met with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr Tomasz BardziÅowski, as well as other management members. The GPW was founded by the Polish State Treasury and is a major financial instrument exchange in Central and Eastern Europe.

 During the meeting, Mr Hui introduced to them the strong momentum of Hong Kong's stock market which has an average daily turnover for the first eight months of 2025 of EUR 27 billion, and the policy support behind the success. He said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is committed to strengthening the breadth and depth of the listing platform and securities market. New initiatives were just announced by the Chief Executive in his 2025 Policy Address aiming to continuously strengthen the stock market, including further optimising the regimes for listing on the Main Board and issuing structured products, as well as encouraging more overseas enterprises to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong. The GPW considers the Mainland and Hong Kong to be growth engines for economy nowadays. Mr Hui anticipated more connections could be established with the GPW to increase the diversity of both stock markets, including real-world asset tokenisation which the GPW is interested in.

 Later at a meeting with the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology of Poland, Mr MichaÅ Baranowski, Mr Hui introduced to him the stellar performance of Hong Kong in wealth management and its equity market, as well as new initiatives aiming to drive financial development, such as building an international gold trading market which will comprise a Government-led central clearing system for gold.

 He then met with the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance (MoF) of Poland, Mr JarosÅaw Neneman; the Director of the International Tax Policy Department in the MoFof Poland, Mr Cezary Krysiak; and the Director of the International Cooperation Department in the MoFof Poland, Mr PaweÅ Siwek, to request the removal of Hong Kong from Poland's ""list of jurisdictions with harmful tax practice"" (the List). Mr Hui highlighted that Hong Kong had been fully supporting international efforts in enhancing tax transparency and combating tax evasion and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had not identified any harmful tax regimes in Hong Kong.

 Noting that Hong Kong had been rated by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes as largely compliant in the international standards on exchange of information on request and is also not on the European Union’s watchlist on tax co-operation, the Polish MoF, taking into account all the circumstances, will positively consider removing Hong Kong from the List.

 Mr Hui also proposed to start negotiations on a Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (CDTA) between Hong Kong and Poland as soon as practicable. Both sides see that a CDTA could be conducive to bilateral trade activities, bringing substantial mutual benefits.

  In the afternoon, Mr Hui had a meeting with the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Wojciech ZajÄczkowski. Mr Hui told him that Hong Kong has maintained its ranking of third place globally, with the rating gaps with first place (New York) and second place (London) narrowed to two points and one point respectively in the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) 38 Report published on the same day. Hong Kong leaped to first place in the world in fintech offerings, and the rankings in the areas of ""business environment"", ""infrastructure"", and ""reputational and general"" also rose to first globally. With the gateway roles of Poland and Hong Kong in their respective regions, the two places can co-operate in various areas to facilitate Mainland enterprises to enter the European market, and European enterprises can access the Asian and Chinese markets through Hong Kong.

  Mr Hui also joined a business luncheon organised by the China Construction Bank to meet with management of various renowned Mainland enterprises which have set up a presence in Europe. He assured them that Hong Kong is determined to position itself as a platform for ""bringing in and going global"" to support Mainland enterprises in seeking overseas expansion. He noted that aside from world-class professional services and its robust financial regime, Hong Kong has much more to offer to assist enterprises to expand further.

  On the same day, Mr Hui also met with the Minister Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Poland, Ms Li Danhong, to update her on the financial landscape in Hong Kong.

  Before concluding his visit to Poland on September 26 (Tychy time), Mr Hui went for a visit to the Sanhua AWECO Polish Appliance to meet with their management team and tour its Tychy plant which is the largest among the three key manufacturing facilities of the company across Europe.

  At a meeting with the General Manager and Chief Financial Officer of the Sanhua EMEA Shared Management Platform of Sanhua Group, Mr Yao Bing, and the Chief Executive Officer of Sanhua Aweco EMEA, Mr Liu Shifeng, Mr Hui elaborated to them on the various initiatives Hong Kong will launch and the professional services available to assist Mainland companies to go global through Hong Kong. He also had a deep discussion with them to learn more about the challenges that Mainland companies have encountered during their journey of overseas expansion.

 Mr Hui will return to Hong Kong on September 27."
環境及生態局局長在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會政策簡報會就《行政長官2025年施政報告》相關措施開場發言（只有中文）,2025-09-27 09:36,2025-09-27 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700258.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（九月二十七日）上午在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會政策簡報會就《行政長官2025年施政報告》相關政策措施的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

相信大家都已經閱讀了文件，所以我只簡單介紹《行政長官2025年施政報告》中有關環境及生態局食物科的措施，讓大家多點時間討論。

推廣寵物友善

推廣寵物友善方面，香港有不少住户飼養寵物，衍生龐大消費需求。食環署（食物環境衞生署）會讓食肆申請容許狗隻進入，而獲批食肆也會有明確標識。食環署會就執行細節諮詢業界，以期在二○二六年年中批出首輪申請，屆時市民和業界將有更多選擇，我們亦希望為餐飲業帶來新商機。

我們會持續優化進口貓狗的檢疫安排，亦鼓勵業界提升寵物相關服務的水平。在加強管理獸醫服務方面，漁護署（漁農自然護理署）一直跟香港獸醫管理局探討各項優化措施，包括延長在管理局網站刊登紀律制裁命令的時間等，關於這些優化措施，管理局今日稍後便會作公布。

支援業界發展

支援業界方面，今年的施政報告有不少措施支援中小企。其中，小販、食物業、漁農業、酒牌的牌照及許可證費用會豁免一年，預計逾六萬個持牌人受惠。

今年第四季開始，食環署將會統籌相關部門採用新的「會審」機制，以精簡的程序加快審批食肆露天座位申請；簡單直接的個案我們估計大約一個月就能完成。

政府會積極協助「香港食品」銷售到內地，並預留香園圍口岸一帶土地，推動食品產業發展，包括食品批發、加工和交易，長遠發展為具特色的食品產業園，希望推廣「食品製造＋旅遊」的概念。

我們並會繼續推動經濟多元發展。我們會持續推展《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》下的措施。明年年中更會為本地漁農產品建立統一新品牌，提高產品辨識度和品牌價值。

環境衞生

此外，我們會繼續改善環境衞生的工作，包括推出優化處理樓宇滲水問題的檢測程序，加快要求業主履行妥善保養物業的責任；同時大力推動以協商和調解方式解決滲水糾紛。

我的簡介到此，希望大家繼續支持我們的工作。我和同事樂意回應大家的提問。"
天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-09-27 09:17,2025-09-27 09:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700247.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月二十七日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-27 09:17,2025-09-27 09:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/27/P2025092700251.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 27) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Opening remarks by STL at Routes World 2025 Host Party (English only) (with photo),2025-09-26 22:12,2025-09-26 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092601127.htm,"Following are the opening remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Routes World 2025 Host Party today (September 26):

Chairman Peter (Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Dr Peter Lam), Chairman Fred (Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam), Steven (Managing Director of Routes, Mr Steven Small), Michael (Executive Vice President - Commercial Development of Informa Markets, Mr Michael Duck), Vivian (Chief Executive Officer of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mrs Vivian Cheung), ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome you all to Hong Kong! I am so glad that we are able to change the welcoming reception to a farewell reception. Otherwise, I will not be able to see all of you and participate in this memorable event. Thank you again, Vivian.

I think most of you have had a very enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, despite some disruption brought by the super typhoon. But on the other hand, I am sure you have had a taste of our famous subtropical cyclone. You can also get a glimpse of the city's super efficiency and resilience in getting back to normal, including our beloved International Airport. I can share with you a few tips on how we can get back to normal after a severe typhoon.

With advanced preparations and the concerted efforts of different Government departments and the Airport Authority Hong Kong, we made different precautionary measures and advanced preparations. As far as the airport is concerned, we had devised a lot of contingency plans to ensure a sustainable and continual operation of the International Airport. Although we had to make a few adjustments to the incoming and outgoing flights, passenger safety is of utmost importance. On the other hand, for this round of severe weather, Vivian and her team had put in little gimmicks like dishing out some popcorns; candies; some goodies including blankets, water, to let our passengers, who might have to stay in the airport for a little while, feel the warmth and comfort that Hong Kong gives them.

Back to the Routes World 2025 today, which is the theme of this event, I am very thankful for the adaptiveness and also efficiency in making all sorts of adjustments to the arrangements, making the event a great success. With such a large crowd of guests and participants standing in front of me today, it reminds me of a part of our Chinese history. A great Chinese Admiral Zheng He (é­å), who was well-known of his voyage, travelled to the modern-day Kenya, transforming all his routes into a vast network expansion which also facilitated the exchange of ideas. In many ways, I think all of you are making history today like he did. You are connecting and the event has brought together more than 2 500 participants from all over the world in renowned aviation industry to Hong Kong.

I know that over the past two days, there have been more than 9 000 meetings going round throughout the event, mapping out some new routes, fostering new friendships and new partnerships with different partners around the globe. In a way, we are making history, and we are shaping a new future for not only our skies, we also shape a new future for our economies and communities. Hong Kong is very ready and has prepared to welcome international conferences and events like Routes World. In fact, we look forward to having more of this kind of events in Hong Kong, to showcase our role as a world-class hub, not only for aviation, but also for innovation, idea exchange and collaboration.

Looking ahead, I would like to announce two things in which we can create new growth for aviation development in Hong Kong. First of all, the Hong Kong Government will lead the Airport Authority in developing negotiations and discussions with our major aviation partners, to bring together some new air services agreements. On the other hand, I know that the Airport Authority, with Fred and Vivian's leadership, has been putting in place a very visionary and energetic outreach team to discuss different business potentials for new airlines coming to Hong Kong. Secondly, I would like to tell you that today the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has just announced the creation and establishment of a new advisory committee, the Advisory Committee on Development of International Aviation Superhub. With this terminology, you can see the importance Hong Kong Government is attaching to develop Hong Kong into not just a normal aviation hub, but an international aviation superhub. With all of you here today assembling, I hope that we can work together to establish new alliance, to foster new relationships and overcome the various challenges posed by the changes in the global landscape, supply chain disruptions or airspace restrictions.

Apart from all this business routine, I would like to appeal to you to take a bit of your time this evening, and take a look at the environment surrounding you today. We are here in this magnificent M+ venue, where history and modernity converge. I am very grateful for the organiser, Informa Markets and also the Airport Authority Hong Kong, for making this event so memorable, and making this farewell event happened. Please don't forget to take your time to look at the magnificent Hong Kong skyline, in which the sky tonight is extremely clear, perhaps because the severe storm has just passed. No matter what storms are ahead of us, we will eventually see a clear blue sky. Thank you very much for attending this farewell event, and I hope you are having an enjoyable evening. Once again, welcome you all to Hong Kong!"

The DSD immediately suspended the use of the damaged sewage main and diverted sewage to the emergency sewage treatment facilities at the Repulse Bay Main Sewage Pumping Station, where the sewage undergoes chemically enhanced settlement and disinfection before discharging into the sea. The DSD is currently carrying out emergency repair works and anticipates the works to be completed by this Sunday. The repaired sewage main will then resume service.

Moreover, the DSD has been collecting sea water samples for testing from Deep Water Bay Beach and Repulse Bay Beach since yesterday and will continue so daily after works completion, and will publish daily the test results on its website (www.dsd.gov.hk/EN/What_s_New/What_s_New/news31011.html), thereby allowing public access to the latest information. The DSD has reported to the Environmental and Ecology Bureau the incident yesterday, and will continue to closely monitor the water quality of the concerned beaches together with the Environmental Protection Department.

Due to the necessary inspection and clearance works of damage and miscellaneous articles caused by Super Typhoon Ragasa, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) announced that some gazetted beaches nearby (including Deep Water Bay Beach and Repulse Bay Beach) were temporarily closed. Members of the public are advised not to swim at Deep Water Bay Beach and Repulse Bay Beach or the nearby waters to safeguard their health. The DSD will continue to closely liaise with the LCSD.

The DSD commenced the construction and rehabilitation of sewage rising mains in Southern District in January this year, so as to construct about 8.8 kilometres of sewage rising mains connecting the Repulse Bay Main Sewage Pumping Station, to the sewerage system at Ap Lei Chau Bridge Road, including the construction of about 1.5 km subsea twin pressurised sewer to replace the above concerned pressurised sewage main, to enhance the overall stability of the sewage system."

署方已即時停用有關污水管，並將污水引流至淺水灣總污水泵房旁的現有緊急應變污水處理設施，經過化學強化沉澱及消毒處理程序後，才排放出大海。署方現正為受損污水管進行緊急修復工程，預計於本週日完成，屆時經修復的污水管亦會重新投入使用。

此外，署方已從昨日起直至修復工程完成之後，每日於深水灣泳灘及淺水灣泳灘抽取海水樣本進行水質化驗，並會透過渠務署網頁（www.dsd.gov.hk/TC/What_s_New/What_s_New/news31011.html）發布有關化驗結果，讓公眾查閱。署方已於昨日通報環境及生態局，並會繼續聯同環境保護署密切監測相關泳灘水質。

由於需要檢視及處理超強颱風「樺加沙」引致的破壞及清理雜物，康樂及文化事務署（康文署）已暫停開放附近刊憲泳灘（包括深水灣泳灘及淺水灣泳灘）。為保障健康，公眾人士請勿在深水灣泳灘及淺水灣泳灘或附近海域游泳。署方會繼續與康文署保持緊密聯繫。

署方已於今年一月展開南區污水泵喉建造及修復工程，以建造約8.8公里長的污水泵喉連接淺水灣總污水泵房至鴨脷洲橋道的污水收集系統，當中包括建造約1.5公里長的海底雙管加壓管道取代涉事的加壓污水管，以加強有關地區污水收集系統的穩定性。"

​​鮮活快線是由粵港兩地政府共同推出，旨在充分利用香港國際機場和港珠澳大橋的優勢，以創新監管模式，簡化鮮活食品的清關流程，便利外地的鮮活食品經香港「引進來」內地消費市場，同時亦助力內地優質的鮮活食品「走出去」海外巿場，發揮香港作為「超級聯繫人」及「超級增值人」的作用，以促進粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）的經貿發展。鮮活快線已由今年四月開始分階段進行試運，來自世界各地載有水果、冰鮮及活海鮮的空陸聯運貨物已順利使用此「綠色通道」經香港迅速中轉至珠海。

​陳子達於儀式上致辭時表示，鮮活快線能夠成功落實是有賴粵港兩地政府的努力及合作，迎難而上，拆牆鬆綁，才可以把兩地相關法規銜接，簡化清關程序，包括取得海關總署的支持於港珠澳大橋珠海公路口岸興建配備有先進溫控設施的指定監管場地、兩地海關採用嶄新思維及利用科技以簡化鮮活食品的中轉清關安排，並獲得食環署的支持豁免該計劃下空陸聯運轉運貨物食物進口商登記要求，為業界降本增效，令鮮活快線成為連接內地與世界各地的重要橋樑，強化香港作為國際物流樞紐的核心角色。陳子達強調香港海關將會繼續推進和深化與內地於不同範疇的高水平合作，共同為大灣區建設和國家發展貢獻重要力量。

是次開通儀式共有近二百名嘉賓出席，包括拱北海關代表、中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室代表、珠海市商務局代表、香港特別行政區政府官員、立法會議員、機管局代表、多國領事、物流業協會、物流業界和鮮活食品進出口商代表。"

ââThe Air-Land Fresh Lane, jointly launched by the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments, aims to utilise the strengths of Hong Kong International Airport and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) to facilitate overseas fresh products imported into the Mainland while empowering high-quality fresh products from the Mainland to go global by adopting a new regulatory model to streamline customs clearance for fresh products. This leverages Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" to promote economic and trade developments in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Since April this year, the Air-Land Fresh Lane has commenced its trial operations by phases; air-to-land consignments of fruits, chilled and live seafood originating from different parts of the world were smoothly imported into Zhuhai via Hong Kong through this ""green channel"".

Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Chan said that the successful implementation of the Air-Land Fresh Lane was attributed to the concerted efforts and co-operation of the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong. By overcoming difficulties and removing barriers one by one, relevant regulations were able to be aligned between the two sides and have clearance procedures simplified, including securing the support from the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China to set up a designated inspection site at the HZMB Zhuhai Port with advanced temperature-controlled facilities, adopting a new mindset and advanced technology to streamline the clearance of fresh food transshipment, and gaining the support from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department to exempt the air-to-land food transshipment under this scheme from the food importer registration requirement. With these measures, the scheme will not only help the industry lower the operating cost but also enhance the overall efficiency, making it become a key bridge connecting the Mainland with global markets and fostering Hong Kong's role as an international logistics hub. Mr Chan also stressed that Hong Kong Customs will continue to promote and deepen high-level collaboration with the Mainland across different areas, thereby contributing to the developments of the GBA and the country.
â
Nearly 200 guests attended the launching ceremony, including representatives of Gongbei Customs, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, and Zhuhai Municipal Bureau of Commerce, officials of the HKSAR Government, a Legislative Council Member, representatives of the AAHK, foreign consuls, and representatives from logistics associations, logistics and fresh food trade sectors."

Deputy Minister Yu (Deputy Minister for Public Communication, Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Republic of Korea, Mr Yu Byung-cha), Chief Executive Mr Park (Chief Executive Officer of National Theater of Korea, Mr Park In-gun), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening, Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello). Welcome to the opening ceremony of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul. I am absolutely delighted to be here with you to share and experience the unique cultural glamour of Hong Kong, right here in the heart of Seoul.

Throughout my career – from transport to tourism, sports and culture – my focus has always been on connecting people. I have always believed that the most empowering journeys are not just about physical experiences, but about the sentimental, transcendent memories we create. This evening, we gather at this beautiful destination to do just that, to foster shared cultural aspirations that will become our lasting memories.

Visiting Seoul feels familiar; I sense a kindred spirit in this dynamic metropolis. Our two cities share a common rhythm – a passion for creativity, reinvention, and for telling stories that move us. Whether it is a K-drama that tugs at your heartstrings or a Hong Kong film that lingers in your memory long after the credits roll, our two cities know how to create stories that resonate far beyond our borders.

Since signing the Memorandum of Understanding on Cultural Co-operation in 2004, Seoul and Hong Kong have built more than partnership; we have developed a deep friendship. Many of you here have brought immense joy to Hong Kong through the ""Festive Korea"" events each autumn. Now, it is our genuine pleasure to return that warmth with Hong Kong Week in Seoul.

Hong Kong Week in Seoul is more than a simple showcase; it is an invitation for all of us to experience Hong Kong in full dimension. Through the horizontal lens of dance, music, film, fashion, visual arts and comics, and the vertical depth of our pop culture, contemporary creations, and shared nostalgia, we offer you a vibrant portrait of our city.

Cantopop ballads and the golden age of Hong Kong cinema have profoundly influenced my own life. I know firsthand how culture lives in and shapes the human heart. That is why I am so excited for you to experience it all: the elegance of our orchestras, the energy of our dancers, our cinematic classics, and the neon-soaked soundscapes of our city.

Today's opening performance by the Hong Kong Ballet exemplifies this spirit. They will present a reimagined Romeo and Juliet in 1960s Hong Kong, blending classical ballet with the fluid power of kung fu. It is bold, poetic, and unmistakably Hong Kong. Our unique strength lies in our deep-rooted, East-meets-West culture.

Throughout the festival, you will see this fusion brought to life by our incredible arts groups – from the Hong Kong Dance Company and City Contemporary Dance Company to the Labora Terry Arts. You will hear it in the music of the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and the Asian Modern Symphony Orchestra. And you will feel it in the creative sparks flying between students from the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts and Sungkyunkwan University.

For film and visual arts lovers, we offer a vibrant mix, from Chinese paintings and comics to a cinematic tribute under the stars at ImagineLand@Seoul. You will be treated to iconic soundtracks from both Hong Kong films and K-dramas, culminating in the screening of An Autumn’s Tale, a timeless classic that is still touching the soft parts of the audience’s hearts in the best way. And with extension activities such as post-screening talk, we hope to give you a deeper understanding of Hong Kong cinema.

But we are going beyond the screen. We are bringing Hong Kong film and fashion together in the Local Power exhibition and fashion show. We invite you to let your imagination take flight on a creative journey that fuses AI technology with pop music of Hong Kong and Korea, featuring designs from Hong Kong, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and Korean designers – showcasing the innovation and unique style of Asia's new generation.

Speaking of storytelling, I must mention our Hong Kong Comics and Culture Exhibition. We will showcase works from different eras, featuring classic Hong Kong comic characters and crossover projects that blend media formats, displaying the martial arts theme and distinctive humour that define Hong Kong comics.

Beyond the stages and screens, I hope this festival inspires you to see Hong Kong for yourself. I hope you will come to walk through our distinct districts, sip Hong Kong-style milk tea in a cha chaan teng, and take in our skyline from the Star Ferry. Our culture lives not just in theatres, but in our streets, our food, our people and even in our newest Kai Tak Sports Park, the Main Stadium of which can host 50 000 spectators under a retractable roof.

Before I close, I must extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korea, and to every partner and artist for your support and contribution. Without you, this vision could not have become a reality.

I wish Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul a resounding success. Now, let us enjoy this evening together, and celebrate the bridges we are building – between our cities, between our cultures, and between our hearts.

Kamsahamnida (Korean: Thank you). Thank you."
CHP investigates case of invasive meningococcal infection,2025-09-26 19:36,2025-09-26 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600970.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 26) is investigating a case of invasive meningococcal infection, and reminds the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of contracting this serious disease.

ããThe case involves a 15-year-old boy with good past health. He presented with a fever, headache, vomiting and petechiae over his four limbs yesterday (September 25). He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital today and was admitted for treatment. He is now in a stable condition. His cerebrospinal fluid specimen tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was meningitis.

Preliminary investigation revealed that his household and school contacts have remained asymptomatic so far. The CHP has distributed preventive drugs to his family member and will continue to monitor the health status of the patient's family members and classmates. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

Meningococcal infection is a statutory notifiable disease. Including this case, the CHP has recorded nine cases this year.

Meningococcal infection is caused by a bacterium known as meningococcus. It is mainly transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, of infected persons. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream (meningococcaemia) or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord (meningococcal meningitis). Meningococcaemia is characterised by a sudden onset of fever, an intense headache, purpura, shock and even death in severe cases. Meningococcal meningitis is characterised by high fever, severe headache, stiff neck followed by drowsiness, vomiting, fear of bright light, or rash; it can cause brain damage or even death.

To prevent meningococcal infection, members of the public are advised to take the following measures:


Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly, especially when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing, and clean hands with alcohol-based handrub when they are not visibly soiled;
Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, hold the saliva with a tissue, dispose of nasal and mouth discharge in a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands immediately;
Avoid crowded places;
Avoid close contact with patients who have a fever or severe headache;
Consult doctors about meningococcal vaccination before travelling to high-risk areas; and
Seek medical advice if you become ill after returning from high-risk areas, and discuss your recent travel history with your doctor.

Pilot project on e-trade document between Hong Kong and ASEAN (with photos),2025-09-26 19:02,2025-09-26 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600631.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, today (September 26) highlighted that Hong Kong strives to explore collaboration opportunities between the single windows of the city and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to promote cross-boundary digital and paperless trade in the region.

 During the discussions at the ninth ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) - Hong Kong, China (HKC) Consultation in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Mr Yau said that HKC has been promoting the digitalisation of business-to-government trade documents and is developing the Trade Single Window (TSW) in three phases to provide a one-stop electronic platform for the trade to submit various trade documents for trade declaration and cargo clearance.

 Acknowledging ASEAN as HKC's second-largest trading partner, Mr Yau noted that HKC is keen to explore the possibility of exchanging trade documents through a collaboration between the ASEAN Single Window and HKC's TSW. As the first step, HKC and ASEAN will explore taking forward a pilot project of exchanging the electronic Certificate of Origin.

 He said he looks forward to the implementation of the pilot project, adding that HKC will continue to work closely with ASEAN and ASEAN member states to explore further collaboration.

 Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the TSW in Hong Kong are already in full service and are well received by the trade. The Government is now pressing ahead with the development of the information technology system of TSW Phase 3 and targets to roll out the services by batch from mid-2026. Upon the full implementation of the TSW, it will have the technical capability to connect with the single windows of other economies or other commercial systems.

 As mentioned in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, Hong Kong strives to explore opportunities for connecting the TSW with the single windows of other economies. Therefore, on top of exploring connectivity with the ASEAN Single Window, Hong Kong has been actively working with the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China to connect the TSW with the Mainland's International Trade Single Window to continue to provide the Mainland-Hong Kong ""Single Submission for Dual Declaration"" Scheme for cargo after the rollout of TSW Phase 3, allowing more enterprises to benefit from the convenience of completing Customs declarations for both the Mainland and Hong Kong sides by making a single submission of road cargo information. Both sides will continue to explore the feasibility of expanding the Scheme to cover other trade documents and transport modes.

 Meanwhile, Mr Yau and the Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry of Malaysia, Mr Tengku Zafrul Aziz, met at a bilateral meeting at the margins of the AEM-HKC Consultation and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Co-operation in Digital Trade to encourage and promote bilateral co-operation in digital trade, including electronic commerce, paperless trade and single window interoperability.

 ""Malaysia is an important trading partner of Hong Kong. The MOU is a demonstration of our longstanding and close relationship, and our desire to further collaborate in areas like digital trade in order to bring mutual economic benefits to our people,"" Mr Yau said."
香港與東盟電子貿易文件先導計劃（附圖）,2025-09-26 19:02,2025-09-26 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600641.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（九月二十六日）強調，香港致力開拓與東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）就單一窗口的合作機遇，以促進區內跨境數字貿易及無紙化貿易的發展。

丘應樺在馬來西亞吉隆坡出席第九屆中國香港─東盟經貿部長會議的討論環節時表示，香港一直推動「企業對政府」貿易文件數字化，並正分三階段實施「貿易單一窗口」，提供一站式電子平台，供業界提交各項貿易文件作報關及貨物清關之用。

丘應樺表示，東盟是香港第二大貿易夥伴，香港銳意探討透過雙方的單一窗口系統之間的協作以交換貿易文件的可能性。作為第一步，香港與東盟會探討推行一項交換電子產地來源證的先導計劃。

他表示期待落實先導計劃，並指香港會繼續與東盟及其成員國緊密合作，探討加強協作。

香港「貿易單一窗口」的第一及第二階段已全面投入服務，並深受業界歡迎。政府正全力推進第三階段的資訊科技系統開發工作，目標是於二○二六年年中起分批推出服務。「貿易單一窗口」全面實施後，將具備技術能力與其他經濟體的單一窗口或其他商業系統連接。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》提到，香港致力探討「貿易單一窗口」與其他經濟體的單一窗口連接的機會。因此，除了尋求與東盟的單一窗口連接外，香港亦積極與國家海關總署合作，推動香港「貿易單一窗口」與內地的國際貿易單一窗口連接，以期在「貿易單一窗口」第三階段推出後，延續內地與香港貨物「一單兩報」計劃，讓更多企業受惠於道路貨物資料「一次錄入，雙向共用」的便利。雙方將繼續探討擴展計劃至涵蓋其他貿易文件及運輸模式的可行性。

在經貿部長會議期間，丘應樺亦與馬來西亞投資、貿易及工業部長Tengku Zafrul Aziz舉行雙邊會面，並簽署數字貿易合作諒解備忘錄，以鼓勵和推動雙方就數字貿易的合作，包括電子商貿、無紙化貿易及單一窗口對接。

丘應樺說：「馬來西亞是香港的重要貿易夥伴。是次簽署合作諒解備忘錄彰顯了雙方長久以來的緊密聯繫，以及我們銳意加強在數字貿易等領域的合作，為兩地人民帶來共同經濟裨益。」"

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening everybody. Annyeonghaseyo (Korean: Hello)!

It is a great pleasure to welcome you all, to the opening ceremony of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul. Since 2019, Hong Kong Week has been a flagship festival organised by the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government, bringing the vibrancy of Hong Kong's arts and culture to international audiences. Having previously staged in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Bangkok, we are glad to now enter the festival's fifth edition, here in Seoul.

For good reasons. Seoul, a dynamic city that celebrates both history and modernity, is committed to fostering innovation, economic development and cultural exchange.

Hong Kong is an international financial, shipping and trade centre. We are also fast developing as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange and an international innovation and technology hub. Our deep connectivity with Korea spans across business, investment, technology and culture, and creates immense opportunities for collaboration and mutual growth.

Hong Kong and Korea, I'm pleased to say, have flourished through our competence, and proficiency, in embracing heritage while driving the transformative capability of different arts forms.

Korea's rich cultural landscape, mesmerising traditional mask dance performances, musical storytelling, as well as its globally popular K-Pop and K-dramas, reflect our appreciation for both tradition and creativity, in breadth and in depth.

Similarly, Hong Kong's arts scene seamlessly blends classical and contemporary influences, establishing a unique identity that resonates with the aspirations of the international stage. These shared values render Hong Kong and Seoul natural partners in artistic collaboration, cultural exchange and creative dialogue.

A city of remarkable cultural richness, Seoul provides an outstanding setting for our Hong Kong Week this year.

This year's Hong Kong Week features an eclectic array of programmes, from Chinese and Western music, and traditional and contemporary dance, to new and restored Hong Kong films, and thought-provoking exhibitions. With performances staged by flagship arts groups as well as emerging young talents, this festival transcends an artistic showcase, and it will bring every participant on a fulfilling arts and cultural journey, filled with fascinating Hong Kong and Korean elements. An integration of our two vibrant cities.

Ladies and gentlemen, our Hong Kong Week will continue to shine on the global stage by deepening collaborations, building new partnerships, inspiring new creations and solidifying connections.

We will continue to foster our friendly relations with Seoul and Korea, not only in the area of arts and culture, but also in business, technology, finance, and more. I warmly invite your exploration of all that Hong Kong offers, through visiting our city, through investments, or through the many opportunities of professional and cultural exchanges we provide.

My sincere gratitude goes to our dedicated partners, especially the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korea, for the tremendous support for making Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul a huge success.

I wish everyone an enjoyable evening! Thank you. Gamsahamnida (Korean: Thank you)."
衞生防護中心調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案,2025-09-26 19:00,2025-09-26 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600950.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月二十六日）正調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案，同時提醒市民時刻注意個人和環境衞生，以減低被傳染這種嚴重疾病的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的15歲男童。他昨日（九月二十五日）開始出現發燒、頭痛、嘔吐及四肢瘀斑，今日到伊利沙伯醫院急症室求醫，需留院治療，現時情況穩定。他的腦脊液樣本經化驗後，證實對腦膜炎雙球菌呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為腦膜炎。

初步調查顯示，他的家人和同學暫時沒有出現病徵。中心已向其家人派發預防性藥物，並監察病人的家人及同班同學的健康情況。中心會繼續調查個案。

侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染是法定須呈報傳染病。計及上述個案，中心今年錄得九宗個案。

腦膜炎雙球菌感染是由腦膜炎雙球菌所引起，主要經由直接接觸帶菌者的呼吸道分泌物（包括口鼻分泌物）而傳播。當細菌入侵血液（腦膜炎雙球菌血症）或包圍腦部及脊髓的內膜（流行性腦膜炎）時，可引致嚴重病症。腦膜炎雙球菌血症的病徵包括突發性發燒、劇烈頭痛、皮膚出現瘀斑及休克，嚴重者甚至會致命。流行性腦膜炎的病徵包括發高燒、劇烈頭痛、頸部僵硬及嗜睡，亦會有嘔吐、畏光或皮疹等情況出現，若情況嚴重更可造成腦部損害或死亡。

中心呼籲市民採取以下預防措施以預防腦膜炎雙球菌感染：


用梘液和清水正確洗手，尤其在雙手被呼吸道分泌物污染時，如打噴嚏後。當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，可用酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應掩着口鼻，用紙巾包裹痰涎，棄置於有蓋的垃圾桶內，並即時洗手；
避免到人多擠迫的地方；
避免與出現發燒或劇烈頭痛病徵的病人作親密接觸；
前往高危地區前，應諮詢醫生有關接種腦膜炎雙球菌疫苗的詳情；及
從高危地區返港後若感到不適，應立即求診，並告知醫生近期曾到訪的地區。


​市民可參閱衞生防護中心網頁以取得更多有關腦膜炎雙球菌感染的資料。"

Around 1 600 teachers commended at Teachers' Day ceremony (with photos),2025-09-26 18:50,2025-09-26 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600893.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Committee on Respect Our Teachers Campaign:

Organised by the Committee on Respect Our Teachers Campaign (CROTC), the Salute to Teachers 2025 - Teachers' Day Ceremony was held today (September 26). The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, officiated at the ceremony and paid tribute to teachers for wholeheartedly nurturing talent with dedication to professionalism in education. Around 1 600 teachers are commended this year.

Speaking at the ceremony, the Chairman of the CROTC, Mr Wong Kam-leung, expressed his gratitude to the teachers for not only passing on knowledge but also cultivating students' affection for their home and country and shaping their character, all accomplished with patience, love, and wisdom. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Respect Our Teachers Campaign, and the CROTC has steadfastly upheld its mission and will continue to join together in promoting the traditional culture of respect for teachers.

Dr Choi expressed gratitude that the Respect Our Teachers Campaign, over the past 30 years, has not only united various sectors of society in their respect and support for teachers but also promoted the fine tradition of respecting teachers and education in Chinese culture, instilling positive energy into Hong Kong's education. She remarked that a professional and conscientious teaching force is the key to the success of Hong Kong education. Hong Kong's leading position in global competitiveness not only reflects the resilience and innovative vitality of its economy but also highlights the high-quality development of its education system and the professional leadership and strength of its teaching force.

She highlighted that the Education Bureau is committed to building a team of high-quality teachers and strongly supporting both teachers and principals in enhancing their professionalism. She emphasised the importance of promoting the cultivation of teachers' morality and ethics, and fostering the spirit of outstanding educators. She encouraged all teachers to regard outstanding educators as role models, to uphold the original aspiration of nurturing students, to drive innovation in teaching, and to strengthen professional exchange. With the teachers being good educators to children and exemplary role models to their peers, more outstanding individuals with virtues and talents can be nurtured.

The CROTC has been organising the Teachers' Commendation Scheme annually since 1995. With this year marking its 30th session, the scheme aims to foster a culture of respect for teachers. Under the scheme, secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and special schools may each nominate two teachers who have demonstrated commitment and excellence in teaching. Over 39 500 teachers have been commended in previous years.

Other officiating guests at the ceremony today included the Acting Permanent Secretary for Education, Ms Ida Lee; the Chairperson of the Curriculum Development Council, Professor Isabella Poon; and the Chairman of the Committee on Home-School Co-operation, Mr Eugene Fong."
商經局局長出席第九屆中國香港--東盟經貿部長會議（附圖）,2025-09-26 18:36,2025-09-26 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600670.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺與馬來西亞投資、貿易及工業部長Tengku Zafrul Aziz今日（九月二十六日）在馬來西亞吉隆坡共同主持第九屆中國香港—東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）經貿部長會議，討論香港與東盟《自由貿易協定》（《自貿協定》）及《投資協定》的實施情況相關事宜，並就香港與東盟未來經濟合作方向等議題交換意見。

香港與東盟《自貿協定》及《投資協定》於二○一七年簽訂，是雙方夥伴關係蓬勃發展的重要支柱。自兩份協定簽訂以來，香港與東盟的商品貿易增加38%，而香港向東盟的直接投資亦增加42%。

丘應樺在會議上發言時，呼籲尚未完成所需內部程序以實施《修訂香港與東盟〈自貿協定〉的第一議定書》的東盟成員國加快進度，以期讓商號更好地利用《自貿協定》，從而促進各締約方的經貿關係發展。

此外，他期望早日簽訂《修訂香港與東盟〈投資協定〉的第一議定書》，為雙方投資者提供更可預測和更具確定性的市場准入，以進一步釋放協定的潛力。

《自貿協定》下新一輪的經濟和技術合作工作計劃今年展開。工作計劃旨在透過技術協助、知識轉移和信息分享活動，協助《自貿協定》的締約方提升能力，今年接獲43份項目建議書，反應十分正面。

丘應樺說：「值得一提的是，多份建議書均聚焦工作計劃下的新重點範疇，包括競爭、可持續經濟發展，以及在香港和東盟成員國日益受關注的議題，例如推廣清真食物。這反映區內的需求不斷轉變，以及我們共同致力深化彼此之間的經濟和技術合作。」

丘應樺亦藉此機會在會上重申香港已準備好盡早加入《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP），並感謝東盟一直支持香港加入協定。他期望早日就成立香港的「加入工作組」取得實質進展，並通過相關職權範圍。

談及香港與東盟的未來經濟合作方向，丘應樺指數字經濟已成為經濟發展的重要支柱。他與東盟成員國分享香港支持中小型企業把握電商機遇的舉措，指「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」是香港其中一項為中小型企業而設的資助計劃，其下的「電商易」讓企業於700萬港元（約89.7萬美元）的累計資助上限中，靈活運用最多100萬港元（約12.8萬美元）在東盟經濟體推行電商項目。

丘應樺亦強調維護多邊貿易制度的重要性，以及香港堅定維護世界貿易組織（世貿組織）的公信力和效率。

他續說：「作為細小、開放及外向型經濟體，我們十分珍視以世貿組織為核心的非歧視性、以規則為本的多邊貿易制度，並視之為抗衡保護主義和無理措施的最佳屏障。尤其在此動盪時期，多邊貿易制度對確保全球供應鏈暢順運作至關重要。」

在經貿部長會議期間，丘應樺分別與Tengku Zafrul Aziz和東帝汶商業與工業部長Filipus Nino Pereira舉行雙邊會議，就共同關注的議題交換意見。他亦與東盟秘書長高金洪博士會面，討論多項經貿議題，並介紹香港就尋求盡早加入RCEP的準備工作。"
"SCED attends 9th ASEAN Economic Ministers - Hong Kong, China Consultation (with photos)",2025-09-26 18:36,2025-09-26 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600668.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, and the Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry of Malaysia, Mr Tengku Zafrul Aziz, cochaired the 9th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Ministers - Hong Kong, China (HKC) Consultation in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, today (September 26) to discuss issues relating to the implementation of the ASEAN-HKC Free Trade Agreement (AHKFTA) and the ASEAN-HKC Investment Agreement (AHKIA), and exchange views among others on the future direction of ASEAN-Hong Kong economic co-operation.

 The AHKFTA and the AHKIA signed in 2017 have served as the key pillars of the flourishing ASEAN-Hong Kong partnership. Since the signing of the agreements, Hong Kong's trade in goods with ASEAN has increased by 38 per cent and the city's outward direct investment to ASEAN has risen by 42 per cent.

 Speaking at the meeting, Mr Yau appealed to those ASEAN member states which have not yet completed their internal procedures to further expedite the processes for the implementation of the First Protocol to Amend the AHKFTA, so as to allow traders to better utilise the free trade agreement and in turn, further drive growth in the economic and trade relations among the parties.

 In addition, he said he looks forward to the early signing of the First Protocol to Amend the AHKIA, with a view to further unlocking the potential of the agreement through greater predictability and certainty in market access for investors of the two sides.

 This year also marks the new cycle of the Economic and Technical Cooperation (ECOTECH) Work Programme under the AHKFTA. The programme aims to build the capacities of the parties of the AHKFTA through technical assistance, knowledge transfer and information sharing activities. It received very positive responses with 43 project proposals submitted this year.

 ""Notably, several proposals focus on new priority areas of the ECOTECH Work Programme, such as competition and sustainable economic development, as well as topics that have been receiving increasing attention in Hong Kong and the ASEAN member states, such as promotion of Halal food. This demonstrates the region's evolving needs and the shared commitment to deepen economic and technical co-operation between us,"" Mr Yau said.

 At the meeting, Mr Yau took the opportunity to reiterate Hong Kong's readiness for early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and thank ASEAN for the continued support to Hong Kong's accession bid. He said he looks forward to having concrete progress in the establishment of an accession working group for Hong Kong soon, along with the adoption of the related terms of reference.

 Turning to the future direction of ASEAN-Hong Kong economic co-operation, Mr Yau noted that the digital economy has become a key pillar of economic development. He shared with ASEAN member states Hong Kong's support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to seize the opportunities brought about by e-commerce. Through the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales, one of the funding schemes for SMEs in Hong Kong, enterprises can flexibly make use of a maximum funding of HK$1 million (around US$128,000) within their cumulative funding ceiling of HK$7 million (around US$897,000) to implement e-commerce projects in ASEAN economies under the E-commerce Easy.

 Mr Yau also stressed the importance of upholding the multilateral trading system (MTS) and Hong Kong's commitment to maintain the credibility and efficiency of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

 ""As a small, open and externally oriented economy, we deeply value the non-discriminatory, rules-based MTS, with the WTO at its core, as our best safeguard against protectionism and arbitrary measures. Particularly in these turbulent times, the MTS is fundamental in ensuring the smooth functioning of global supply chains,"" he added.

 On the sidelines of the meeting, Mr Yau held bilateral meetings with Mr Tengku Zafrul Aziz, and the Minister of Commerce and Industry of Timor-Leste, Mr Filipus Nino Pereira, to exchange views on issues of mutual interest. He also met with the Secretary-General of ASEAN, Dr Kao Kim Hourn, to discuss various trade and economic issues, and brief him on Hong Kong's preparatory work in seeking early accession to the RCEP."
Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in GBA to be extended to designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha,2025-09-26 18:30,2025-09-26 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600858.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced today (September 26) that the Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in the Greater Bay Area will be extended to Zhuhai People's Hospital (ZHPH) and the Nansha Division of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, with a view to offering residents of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) with high-quality, efficient and convenient cross-boundary medical transfer arrangements.

 To ensure the smooth implementation of relevant arrangements, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, in collaboration with the People's Government of Zhuhai Municipality, conducted a drill today to assess the simulated transfer of patients under the cross-boundary ambulance arrangements. The drill was conducted smoothly in general, and it is expected that the Pilot Scheme can be extended to Zhuhai by the end of this year.

 In his recent Policy Address, the Chief Executive has proposed to extend the cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements with the governments of Guangdong and Macao in an orderly manner, including two-way transfers and expansion to cover designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha. Following liaison between the HHB and Zhuhai and Nansha, the designated hospitals of the two places have been identified as ZHPH and the Nansha Division of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University respectively. Today's drill mainly aimed at testing the routing of the cross-boundary ambulance between ZHPH and the designated hospital in Hong Kong (i.e. Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH)), as well as the immigration arrangements. After departure from ZHPH, the designated Zhuhai cross-boundary ambulance travelled to PMH via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Zhuhai Port and later returned to Zhuhai via the HZMB.

 The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""With the support of various national ministries, the HKSAR Government, in collaboration with the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, and the Macao Special Administrative Region Government, officially launched the one-year Pilot Scheme on November 30 last year. Through the concerted efforts of the HKSAR Government and the People's Government of Zhuhai Municipality, today's drill was conducted successfully to streamline the flow of direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer. We will continue to review the effectiveness and operational experience of the Pilot Scheme, with the medical needs, safety and interests of patients as the prime concerns, as well as to press ahead with the objective of extending the arrangements in an orderly manner, including implementing two-way transfers and expansion to cover Nansha as set out in the Policy Address.""

 The overall operation of the Pilot Scheme has been smooth since its implementation. A total of 16 patients were transferred from the designated sending hospitals in Shenzhen and Macao (i.e. the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital and the Conde S. Januario Hospital of Macao) to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong. According to professional medical assessment, patients of the above cases have a need for continuous hospitalisation for treatment. Their conditions were relatively stable, but they were unable to return to Hong Kong on their own and were unsuitable for transfer to Hong Kong ambulances via the existing boundary control points."

醫衞局局長盧寵茂教授表示：「在國家多個部委支持下，香港特區政府聯同廣東省和深圳市人民政府，以及澳門特區政府於去年十一月三十日正式推出為期一年的試行計劃。在香港特區政府與珠海市人民政府的共同努力下，兩地今日成功進行演練，理順跨境直通救護車運送流程。我們會持續檢視試行計劃的成效及運作經驗，以病人的醫療需要、安全和利益作首要考慮，並繼續積極推進《施政報告》提出有序擴展安排的目標，包括實施雙向轉運，以及擴展至南沙區。」

The cross-boundary bond repurchase (repo) business, jointly advocated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the People's Bank of China (PBoC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange was officially launched today (September 26).

Relevant Mainland financial authorities/regulators jointly issued the ""Notice to Further Supporting Overseas Institutional Investors in Conducting Bond Repo Business in China's Bond Market"" today. Under this policy measure, all overseas institutional investors already investing in the onshore bond market, including Bond Connect investors, will be allowed to participate in the onshore repo business and to remit the RMB liquidity thus obtained for offshore use. This measure is another important policy initiative following the launch of the offshore RMB repo business by the HKMA in February this year. It will provide more stable liquidity support for Hong Kong's offshore RMB market, and effectively lower the RMB funding cost. The cross-boundary repo and offshore RMB repo businesses will complement each other in addressing offshore investors' needs of asset allocation and liquidity management. It will help activate offshore investors' onshore bond holdings and further enhance the attractiveness of onshore bonds, thereby promoting the use of RMB as an investment and funding currency in the international markets.

  TheChief Executive of the HKMA,Mr Eddie Yue, said, ""We are pleased to launch the cross-boundary repo business. This is one of the key initiatives on which the HKMA and the PBoC have been working closely, to continuously enhance the Bond Connect business. This measure will bolster offshore RMB liquidity in Hong Kong, increase overseas investors' interest in allocating to RMB assets, and promote more diversified development of offshore RMB businesses. This in turn will help consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and an offshore RMB business hub."""

Ms Chan and the delegation were received and welcomed by the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, Mr Peng Qinghua, at the Great Hall of the People. They then met with officials of the Ministry of Education. Ms Chan said that this year marks the 80th Anniversary of the Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. It was profoundly meaningful to travel to Nanjing and Beijing with representatives from the education sector before National Day, visiting the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, and the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the Marco Polo Bridge in Beijing, commemorating and remembering the nation's martyrs and bearing in mind the profound inspiration of ""taking history as a mirror and cherishing peace"".

Ms Chan expressed gratitude to the Ministry of Education, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Department of Education of Jiangsu Province and various Mainland units for their strong support, facilitating the smooth conduct of the exchange programme.

This year, the delegation comprised around 130 participants from the education sector, including representatives from tertiary education institutions and professional education organisations, as well as principals, vice-principals and teachers from primary and secondary schools and kindergartens. The delegation began a six-day visit on September 22. Apart from visiting significant sites of the War of Resistance in Nanjing and Beijing and observing the flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square, they also toured the Regional University-Industry Technology Transfer Center (Jiangsu), Peking University, Nanjing University, primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and an innovation technology enterprise to learn about the latest national developments in education and innovation technology and strengthen exchanges with Mainland educators, broadening professional horizons.

Ms Chan and the delegation will conclude their visit and return to Hong Kong tomorrow (September 27)."
InvestHK leads delegation to Europe showcasing Hong Kong's strengths as leading family office hub (with photos),2025-09-26 18:15,2025-09-26 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/26/P2025092600735.htm,"  The Global Head of Family Office at Invest Hong Kong, Mr Jason Fong, yesterday (September 25) concluded a European mission spanning London, Zurich, Geneva and Milan, where he led a delegation to highlight Hong Kong's strengths as a leading global family office hub. This trip has prompted greater interest among European families and professionals in exploring the opportunities available in Hong Kong.

  During the visit, Mr Fong and the delegation held a series of in-depth exchanges with European family offices, family representatives, asset owners, wealth managers and professional service providers. These engagements included roundtables, panel sessions, high-level forums, investor luncheons and one-on-one meetings. The meetings highlighted Hong Kong's advantages as Asia's leading international financial centre - an open-architecture capital market. The robust legal system in Hong Kong and the unique positioning under ""one country, two systems"" showcase the city as the ideal hub for European investors seeking to access Chinese Mainland and Asian markets.

  Mr Fong said, ""As a true international financial centre and Asia's largest cross-border wealth management hub, Hong Kong offers unparalleled advantages for global families seeking long-term and diversified growth. With the Government's dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team and a comprehensive suite of facilitation measures, we welcome European families to establish a presence in Hong Kong, expand their businesses, and capture the immense growth opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Mainland.""

  The Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Strela Capital GmbH, Ms Ekaterina Tattersall, pointed out, ""Switzerland has long been recognised as a trusted hub for cross-border asset management in Europe, and Hong Kong plays an equally vital role in the Asian region. Both markets boast robust regulatory frameworks, deep financial expertise, and global connectivity as their core advantages. For us, Hong Kong is an indispensable extension of our global wealth strategy.""

  The Director of Bernina Bioinvest, a private investment company focused on early-stage biotech and medtech, Dr Bettina Ernst, said, ""Hong Kong's growing life sciences ecosystem - combining academic research, clinical networks, and capital - makes it a compelling base for early-stage biotech and medtech innovation. For investors like us, the city's regional connectivity and regulatory openness create practical pathways from laboratory ideas to clinical and commercial milestones. Hong Kong sits at a valuable intersection of talent, research, and partnerships across Asia, which is an excellent location for investing in innovation. For early-stage biotech and medtech companies, access to universities, clinicians, and cross-border collaborators helps accelerate validation and scale, which is essential for translating science into patient impact.""

  The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Wings Securities Limited, Mr Cliff Ip, one of the members of the Hong Kong delegation to Europe, said, ""This trip was an exciting step in strengthening the connection between Hong Kong and European family offices. It opened doors for vibrant exchanges of investment ideas and sparked strong enthusiasm on both sides to explore co-investment opportunities. Embracing diversification across Hong Kong, Chinese Mainland, Asia and Europe is proving to be one of the powerful strategies for enhancing portfolio resilience. With world-class infrastructure, a strong talent pool, and resolute government support for the development of the family office sector, Hong Kong has firmly established itself as an essential player in the global family office dialogue.""

  ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" emphasises continued growth and support for the family office sector, including further enhancing preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme."
