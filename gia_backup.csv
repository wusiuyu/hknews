海關早前接獲舉報，指一間位於新蒲崗的婚禮佈置公司未能提供顧客已購買的婚禮佈置服務。海關人員隨即展開調查，發現該公司早前突然結業，已預購婚禮佈置服務的顧客因而無法使用有關服務，而該公司亦未有向顧客退還款項。

經跟進調查後，海關人員今日採取執法行動，拘捕涉案婚禮佈置公司的一名四十歲男東主。

案件仍在調查中，被捕男子現正保釋候查。

海關一直高度關注事件，並呼籲受影響的市民向海關提供資料。截至今日下午三時，海關共接獲一百六十六名市民舉報，涉及約一百九十萬元的婚禮佈置服務合約。

海關提醒商戶須遵守《條例》的規定，而消費者於購買服務時亦應光顧信譽良好的商戶，在作出預繳式消費決定前要謹慎考慮。

根據《條例》，任何商戶在接受付款時，意圖不供應有關產品或意圖供應與有關產品有重大分別的產品，或沒有合理理由相信能在指定或合理的時間內供應有關產品，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁五年。

Hong Kong Customs arrests male owner of wedding decoration company suspected of engaging in unfair trade practices in sale of services ,2025-06-20 17:15,2025-06-20 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000578.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (June 20) arrested a male owner of a wedding decoration company suspected of engaging in wrongly accepting payments in the sale of services, in contravention of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO).

Customs earlier received information alleging that a wedding decoration company in San Po Kong failed to provide wedding decoration services purchased by customers. Customs officers immediately conducted an investigation and found that customers who had purchased prepaid wedding decoration services were unable to use the services after the company suddenly suspended the business earlier. The company also failed to arrange refunds to the customers.

After a follow-up investigation, Customs officers today conducted an enforcement operation and arrested a 40-year-old male owner of the wedding decoration company connected with the case.

An investigation is ongoing, and the arrested man has been released on bail pending further investigation.

Customs has been paying close attention to the incident and called on members of the public affected by the incident to provide information. As of 3pm today, Customs had received 166 complaints, involving wedding decoration contracts amounting to about $1.9 million.

Customs reminds traders to comply with the requirements of the TDO. Consumers are also reminded to procure services at reputable shops and think prudently before making decisions for consumption with prepayment.

Under the TDO, any trader commits an offence if, at the time of acceptance of payment, the trader intends not to supply the product or intends to supply a materially different product, or there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the trader will be able to supply the product within a specified or reasonable period. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the TDO to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 80 80 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk), or by filling in an online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

During an anti-illicit cigarette operation conducted in Po Tin Estate, Tuen Mun, on April 22, Customs officers arrested a man, aged 37 and claiming to be unemployed, for engaging in illicit cigarette distribution activities, and seized about 23 000 illicit cigarettes from his private vehicle. The vehicle was also detained.

During another anti-illicit cigarette operation conducted in Tin Ching Estate, Tin Shui Wai, yesterday afternoon (June 19), Customs officers spotted the same man, who was on bail, suspected of distributing illicit cigarettes. Upon interception, 19 000 illicit cigarettes were found inside another private vehicle of the man. Customs officers then arrested the man again and seized the private vehicle.

A total of about 42 000 illicit cigarettes were seized, with an estimated market value of about $189,000 and a duty potential of about $139,000, from the two cases.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Hong Kong's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position statistics for first quarter of 2025,2025-06-20 16:30,2025-06-20 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000358.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (June 20) the preliminary Balance of Payments (BoP) and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics of Hong Kong for the first quarter of 2025. This release also included the preliminary External Debt (ED) statistics of Hong Kong for the same period.

I. Balance of Payments

  Hong Kong recorded a BoP deficit of $85.4 billion (10.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) in the first quarter of 2025. Reserve assets correspondingly decreased by the same amount. This was against a BoP surplus of $31.4 billion (3.8% of GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Current account

  The current account recorded a surplus of $125.2 billion (15.7% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2025. This reflects that Hong Kong's savings was greater than its investment, enabling Hong Kong to accumulate external financial assets (such as equity securities or debt securities) as a buffer against global financial volatilities. Compared with the current account surplus of $95.3 billion (12.4% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2024, the increase in surplus was mainly due to the increases in net inflow of primary income and services surplus.

  The goods deficit decreased to $3.0 billion in the first quarter of 2025, compared with $6.2 billion in the same quarter of 2024. Over the same period, the services surplus increased from $44.7 billion to $54.9 billion. The primary income inflow and outflow amounted to $521.3 billion and $441.6 billion respectively, thus yielding a net inflow of $79.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, compared with a net inflow of $61.3 billion in the same quarter of 2024.

Financial account

  An overall increase in financial non-reserve assets amounting to $245.8 billion (30.7% of GDP) was recorded in the first quarter of 2025, compared with an overall increase of $102.5 billion (12.3% of GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2024. The overall increase recorded in the first quarter of 2025 was due to the net increases in other investment, portfolio investment and direct investment, partly offset by the net decrease in financial derivatives.

  In the first quarter of 2025, reserve assets decreased by $85.4 billion, as against an increase of $31.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.

II. International Investment Position

  At the end of the first quarter of 2025, both Hong Kong’s external financial assets and liabilities stood at a very high level, amounting to $54,485.1 billion (17.0 times of GDP) and $37,562.2 billion (11.7 times of GDP) respectively, a typical feature of a prominent international financial centre.

  Hong Kong's net external financial assets (i.e. assets minus liabilities) amounted to $16,922.9 billion (5.3 times of GDP) at the end of the first quarter of 2025, compared with $15,872.9 billion (5.0 times of GDP) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. Hong Kong's net external financial assets to GDP ratio is one of the largest in the world, which provides the economy with a strong cushion against sudden external shocks.

III. External Debt

  At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Hong Kong's gross ED amounted to $14,948.8 billion (4.7 times of GDP). Compared with $14,830.0 billion (also 4.7 times of GDP) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, gross ED increased by $118.8 billion. This was mainly attributable to the increases in ED of other sectors and ED of the banking sector, partly offset by the decrease in debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending).

  As one of the world's major financial centres, Hong Kong has a significant amount of ED held against the local banking sector arising through normal banking businesses. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, 53.3% of Hong Kong's ED was attributable to the banking sector. Other ED mainly consisted of ED of other sectors (29.3%) and debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending) (16.2%).

Further information

  BoP is a statistical statement that systematically summarises, for a specific time period (typically a year or a quarter), the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world (i.e. between residents and non-residents).

  IIP is a balance sheet showing the stock of external financial assets and liabilities of an economy at a particular time point. The difference between the total value of external financial assets and liabilities is the net IIP of the economy, which provides a measure of net financial claims on non residents plus gold bullion held as monetary gold.

  Gross ED, at a particular time point, is the outstanding amount of those actual current, and not contingent, liabilities that are owed to non-residents by residents of an economy and that require payment of principals and / or interests by the debtors at some time points in the future.

  Table 1 presents Hong Kong's BoP. Table 2 presents the detailed current account and capital account, while Table 3 presents the detailed financial account. Table 4 shows Hong Kong's IIP, and Table 5 shows Hong Kong's ED.

  Statistics on BoP, IIP and ED for the first quarter of 2025 are preliminary figures, which are subject to revision upon the availability of more data.

  The latest statistical tables of BoP (including seasonally adjusted current account), IIP and ED can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode260.html). Analysis of the statistics, together with the conceptual and methodological details, are presented in the publication Balance of Payments, International Investment Position and External Debt Statistics of Hong Kong, First Quarter 2025 published by the C&SD.

Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in May 2025 was 1.0%, also smaller than that in April 2025 (1.3%). The smaller increase was mainly due to the decreases in inbound and outbound transport fares as well as the charges for package tours.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of change in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending May 2025 was -0.1%, the same as that for the 3-month period ending April 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of change were 0.1% and 0.0%.

  Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.8%, 1.6% and 1.2% respectively in May 2025, as compared to 2.6%, 1.8% and 1.6% respectively in April 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.3%, 0.8% and 0.8% respectively in May 2025, as compared to 1.4%, 1.1% and 1.2% respectively in April 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending May 2025, the average monthly rates of change in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were all -0.1%. The corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending April 2025 were -0.2%, -0.1% and -0.1% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending May 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.0% respectively, and the corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending April 2025 were all 0.0%.

  Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in May 2025 for electricity, gas and water (19.7%), housing (2.9%), transport (2.2%), miscellaneous services (1.4%), meals out and takeaway food (1.3%), miscellaneous goods (0.5%), and alcoholic drinks and tobacco (0.5%).

  On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in May 2025 for clothing and footwear (-5.3%), durable goods (-2.3%), and basic food (-1.4%).

  Taking the first 5 months of 2025 together, the Composite CPI rose by 1.7% over a year earlier. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.4%, 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.2%, 1.5%, 1.1% and 1.0% respectively.

  For the 3 months ending May 2025, the Composite CPI rose by 1.8% over a year earlier, while the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) rose by 2.4%, 1.6% and 1.3% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

  For the 12 months ending May 2025, the Composite CPI was on average 1.8% higher than that in the preceding 12-month period. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.3%, 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.1% and 1.1% respectively.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed modest in recent months. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.0% over a year earlier in May, giving an increase of 1.2% in the first five months of the year. Price pressures on various major components were contained in general.

  Looking ahead, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term. Pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check. The Government will monitor the situation closely.

The time series on the year-on-year rates of change in the CPIs before and after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures are shown in Table 2. For discerning the latest trend in consumer prices, it is also useful to look at the changes in the seasonally adjusted CPIs.

二零二五年第一季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸統計,2025-06-20 16:30,2025-06-20 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000369.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月二十日）發布二零二五年第一季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸的初步統計數字，並一併發布同期的香港對外債務的初步統計數字。

I. 國際收支平衡

香港於二零二五年第一季錄得854億元的國際收支赤字（相當於本地生產總值的10.7%），而儲備資產相應地減少同等數額。二零二四年第四季則錄得314億元的盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的3.8%）。

經常賬戶

二零二五年第一季的經常賬戶錄得1,252億元盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的15.7%），這反映香港儲蓄多於投資，令其累積對外金融資產（例如股本證券或債務證券），在環球金融波動時提供緩衝。與二零二四年第一季的953億元經常賬戶盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的12.4%）比較，盈餘增加主要是由於初次收入淨流入和服務貿易盈餘增加所致。

貨物貿易赤字由二零二四年第一季的62億元減少至二零二五年同季的30億元。同期，服務貿易盈餘由447億元增加至549億元。二零二五年第一季的初次收入流入和流出分別為5,213億元和4,416億元，從而產生797億元淨流入，而二零二四年同季則錄得613億元淨流入。

金融賬戶

二零二五年第一季非儲備金融資產錄得2,458億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的30.7%），而二零二四年第四季則錄得1,025億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的12.3%）。二零二五年第一季的整體增幅源自其他投資、證券投資和直接投資淨增加，而金融衍生工具淨減少則抵銷了部分的整體增幅。

二零二五年第一季儲備資產減少854億元，而二零二四年第四季則增加314億元。

II. 國際投資頭寸

在二零二五年第一季季末，香港的對外金融資產和負債總值均處於很高的水平，分別為544,851億元（相當於本地生產總值的17.0倍）和375,622億元（相當於本地生產總值的11.7倍），這是一個重要國際金融中心常見的特點。

在二零二五年第一季季末，香港的對外金融資產淨值（即資產扣除負債）達169,229億元（相當於本地生產總值的5.3倍），而二零二四年第四季季末則為158,729億元（相當於本地生產總值的5.0倍）。香港的對外金融資產淨值與本地生產總值的比率是世界最大之一，為香港經濟面對突如其來的外來衝擊發揮強大的緩衝作用。

III. 對外債務

在二零二五年第一季季末，香港的對外債務總額為149,488億元（相當於本地生產總值的4.7倍）。與二零二四年第四季季末的148,300億元（亦是相當於本地生產總值的4.7倍）比較，對外債務總額增加1,188億元，主要是由於其他界別的對外債務和銀行界別的對外債務增加所致，而直接投資債務負債（公司間借貸）的減少則抵銷了部分的增幅。

作為世界其中一個主要金融中心，香港有大量源於本地銀行界別、透過日常的銀行業務而產生的對外債務。在二零二五年第一季季末，銀行界別的對外債務佔整體的53.3%。其他的對外債務主要包括其他界別的對外債務（29.3%）和直接投資的債務負債（公司間借貸）（16.2%）。

其他資料

國際收支平衡是一項統計報表，有系統地撮錄在一個指定期間內（一般是一年或一季）某經濟體與世界各地之間（即居民與非居民之間）進行的經濟交易。

國際投資頭寸是顯示一個經濟體在某特定時點的對外金融資產及負債存量的資產負債表。對外金融資產及負債總值的差額為該經濟體的國際投資頭寸淨值，等於對非居民的淨金融債權加上作為貨幣黃金持有的金塊。

對外債務總額指一個經濟體的居民在某特定時點欠非居民的實際現有（而並非或有）未償還負債款額。負債人並須於將來某些時點償還本金及／或利息。

表1展示香港國際收支平衡。表2展示詳細的經常賬戶及資本賬戶，而表3則展示詳細的金融賬戶。表4展示香港的國際投資頭寸，而表5則展示香港的對外債務。

二零二五年第一季的國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計數字均屬初步數字，日後將根據更新資料修訂。

最新的國際收支平衡（包括經季節性調整的經常賬戶）、國際投資頭寸及對外債務的統計表可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/scode260.html）下載。相關統計數字的分析和概念及方法，載列於政府統計處出版的《香港國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計（2025年第1季）》內。用戶可以在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040001&scode=260）下載該刊物。

Speech by DCS at Canada Day Reception (English only) (with photos),2025-06-20 16:02,2025-06-20 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000553.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, at the Canada Day Reception today (June 20):

Consul General Reeves (Consul General of Canada to Hong Kong and Macao, Mr Charles Edwin Reeves), Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon! It is a great pleasure to be here with you, in honour of Canada Day, the country's 158th anniversary.

  Today, we stand together to celebrate the deep and longstanding connections between the people of Canada and the Hong Kong SAR, who have forged strong ties from business and commerce to social, culture and family.

  Less than two months ago, Canada held its federal election. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Canada on smoothly holding the election and returning its 24th Prime Minister. I am delighted to note that, just two weeks ago, Prime Minister Carney (Prime Minister of Canada, Mr Mark Carney) spoke on the phone with Premier Li Qiang of our country. Both leaders emphasised the enormous potential in China-Canada co-operation and their determination to reset bilateral ties. This augurs well for the bilateral relations between the two nations and between Canada and Hong Kong in the foreseeable future.

  And there is so much to work together for - from safeguarding free trade and the multilateral trading system, to promoting sustainable development and building ties in any number of sectors. For this promising agenda, Hong Kong definitely has a role to play and contribute. Under the great concept and national policy of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong, as a Special Administrative Region of China, benefits from national programmes such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Another good example is the country according Hong Kong the position of the ""eight centres"" in the National 14th Five-year Plan, which has opened up a wide array of new opportunities for the relevant sectors in Hong Kong, such as finance, I&T, trade, aviation, logistics, arts and cultures and so on. The opportunities are not only for Hong Kong; they are also open to overseas companies, including Canadian enterprises, which use Hong Kong as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world.

  Canada has a strong presence in Hong Kong. There are about 100 Canadian firms maintaining offices in Hong Kong across a broad spectrum of sectors, of which 20 are financial institutions, and some - such as Manulife and Sun Life - have been doing business in the city for more than 100 years. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, with over 2 400 members, is also the largest Canadian Chamber outside Canada.

  We thank the Canadian community and businesses for placing importance on Hong Kong. I am pleased to say that, in spite of the many changes in the external environment, Hong Kong has maintained its resilience and robustness. We still rank as the world's freest economy in the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report; our IPO (initial public offering) market is bustling with the highest number of IPOs recorded worldwide last month, recording $76 billion raised from new share offerings so far in 2025; we are the largest offshore RMB business hub, handling 80 per cent of offshore RMB transactions; and just this week, we are ranked the world's third most competitive economy in the 2025 IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Ranking. In short, Hong Kong remains a favourable place to do business.

  In addition to doing businesses, it is heartening to see that our co-operation bears fruit in other areas such as arts and culture. Last September, our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency organised a delegation to the Toronto International Film Festival, to promote location filming in Hong Kong; and six Hong Kong films were screened at the ""Making Waves - Navigators of Hong Kong Cinema"" touring film programme in Montreal in October. And in April this year, six Canadian films and co-productions were screened at the 49th Hong Kong International Film Festival. 

  I look forward to making more waves, to more Hong Kong-Canadian co-operation - not only in film and the creative industries, but also in business and finance and every other sector, for our economies, our communities and our flourishing future.

  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having me on this joyous occasion. Happy Canada Day!

  Thank you very much."

HKMA and PBoC launch Payment Connect,2025-06-20 15:56,2025-06-20 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000306.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced today (June 20) the launch of Payment Connect on June 22, 2025. A launch ceremony for Payment Connect was held in Beijing today. The Governor of the PBoC, Mr Pan Gongsheng; Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council Mr Wang Linggui;and the Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,attended the ceremony and delivered remarks. The ceremony was officiated by Deputy Governor of the PBoC Mr Lu Lei. Representatives from system operators and participating institutions from the Mainland and Hong Kong also attended the ceremony.

Payment Connect refers to the linkage between the Mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS) (Note 1)and Hong Kong's Faster Payment System (FPS) (Note 2), which supports secure, efficient and convenient real-time cross-boundary payment for residents and institutions in both places. By simply inputting the recipient's mobile number or account number, residents in both places can make instant small-value cross-boundary remittances.

  Mr Yue said, ""Payment Connect is one of the key initiatives in strengthening co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong. The connection between the faster payment systems in both places enhances the efficiency of cross-boundary payments, supporting trade activities and personnel exchange. This development will further promote Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre and offshore Renminbi business hub. Payment Connect will cater to the daily needs of residents in both places for cross-boundary remittances and payments.

香港金融管理局（金管局）及中國人民銀行（人民銀行）今日（六月二十日）公布將於二○二五年六月二十二日推出「跨境支付通」。今天雙方於北京舉行「跨境支付通」啓動儀式，人民銀行行長潘功勝、中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室副主任王靈桂、金管局總裁余偉文出席並致辭，由人民銀行副行長陸磊主持。兩地負責營運系統和參與服務的機構代表均有出席。

「跨境支付通」是內地的網上支付跨行清算系統（IBPS）（註一）與香港快速支付系統「轉數快」（註二）的互聯，為兩地居民及機構提供安全、高效和便捷的即時跨境支付服務。兩地居民可以透過輸入收款方的手機號碼或帳戶號碼，進行即時小額跨境匯款。

余偉文表示：「『跨境支付通』是內地與香港合作的重要舉措之一，通過連接兩地快速支付系統實現互聯互通，有效提升跨境支付效率，便利經貿活動和人員往來，有利於鞏固和提升香港國際金融中心及離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。『跨境支付通』可以更好滿足兩地居民對跨境匯款和支付的需求，惠及民生所需，亦標誌著香港轉數快在拓展跨境支付方面取得進一步成果。」

「跨境支付通」推出初期，兩地分別有六家參與機構（附件），服務會陸續推出並逐步加入更多參與機構。

註一：內地網上支付跨行清算系統（IBPS），是由中國人民銀行指導清算總中心建成的內地快速支付系統，支持用戶通過開戶銀行的手機銀行、網上銀行辦理實時跨行零售支付業務。使用者可通過系統足不出戶辦理跨行帳戶管理、資金匯劃、資金歸集等業務，並可即時獲取業務處理結果。

註二：金管局於二○一八年九月推出快速支付系統「轉數快」，系統連接銀行及儲值支付工具營運商，讓市民可以隨時隨地利用收款人的手機號碼或電郵地址，進行跨行即時資金轉帳。"

丘應樺首先與初創企業網絡La French Tech Bordeaux和波爾多當地科技初創企業的代表舉行商業圓桌會議，介紹香港的初創生態圈最新情況，以及有利初創和企業蓬勃發展的友善營商環境。

丘應樺指，香港的初創社群近年錄得可觀發展和日趨多元化。二○二四年，香港有近4 700間初創企業，創歷史新高，較二○二三年增加約一成。初創企業創辦人的背景尤其多元，當中約28%創辦人來自香港境外。如此令人鼓舞的成績，足證香港憑藉簡單低稅制、世界級金融服務，以及聯通內地和國際商機等關鍵優勢，對創業家甚具吸引力。

丘應樺表示，香港特別行政區政府致力發展香港成為領先的創新科技樞紐，初創企業擔當重要角色。他鼓勵波爾多的初創社群來港擴展業務，善用香港作為進軍內地和亞洲龐大市場門戶的戰略位置。

  Mr Yau first held a business roundtable with representatives of La French Tech Bordeaux, a start-up network, and Bordeaux-based technology start-ups to update them on Hong Kong's latest start-up ecosystem and business-friendly environment for start-ups and entrepreneurs to thrive.

  Mr Yau highlighted that Hong Kong's start-up community has seen remarkable growth and diversification in recent years. In 2024, the number of start-ups in the city reached a record high of approximately 4 700, up about 10 per cent from the previous year. The founder base is notably diverse, with around 28 per cent of start-up founders coming from outside Hong Kong. The encouraging result is a testament to Hong Kong's attractiveness to innovators, assisted by several key advantages such as a low and simple tax system, world-class financial services and the accessibility to both Mainland and international business opportunities.

  He said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is firmly committed to positioning Hong Kong as a leading innovation and technology hub where start-ups play a pivotal role. He encouraged Bordeaux's start-up community to expand their operations into Hong Kong, leveraging the city's strategic position as a gateway to the vast markets on the Mainland and in Asia.

  Mr Yau also paid a courtesy call on the Mayor of Bordeaux, Mr Pierre Hurmic, to brief him on Hong Kong's latest initiatives to drive economic development, such as the reduction of liquor duty, and exchange views on forging closer bilateral relations in various areas such as start-ups, and wine and liquor industries.

  In the evening, Mr Yau attended the Bordeaux Wine Festival, the leading wine event in France, to learn about the latest developments of Bordeaux wine and liquor.

  Mr Yau will continue his visit to Bordeaux."

The areas of collaboration may include the promotion of a public-private partnership approach, collaboration with foreign investment, smart construction and innovative technologies, technical capability building and professional knowledge exchanges, thereby enhancing productivity, cost management and project performance of the construction industry in both places, as well as laying a foundation for seeking further collaboration in the future.

  On June 19 (Riyadh time), Mr Lau visited two major development projects, Qiddiya and Diriyah Gate, in Riyadh of Saudi Arabia and met with senior members of the projects to learn about the planning and progress of the work. They also shared experiences in taking forward major infrastructure projects.

During his visit to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha and Riyadh, Mr Lau called on local officials, visited major infrastructure development projects and met with industry representatives to exchange views on issues related to infrastructure development, including the achievements of the introduction of advanced construction materials and technologies from the Mainland to Hong Kong. He said that Hong Kong would serve as a ""super connector"" between the Mainland and the rest of the world, support and take forward the development of the Belt and Road Initiative with a view to making significant contributions to the high-quality development of the country.

Mr Lau concluded his visit on June 19 (Riyadh time) and returned to Hong Kong today (June 20)."
運輸及物流局局長在立法會交通事務委員會就檢視隧道收費開場發言（只有中文）,2025-06-20 14:34,2025-06-20 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000397.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（六月二十日）在立法會交通事務委員會就檢視隧道收費的開場發言全文：

主席、各位委員：

就今日的議題，我相信大家都很關注及踴躍。讓我先講幾句，然後邀請運輸署同事以簡單的投影片，提綱挈領，就該檢視與大家分享。

今日我們就二零二五至二六年《財政預算案》演辭提及的政府隧道及主幹道收費檢視的分析結果，諮詢委員，聽取意見，同時藉此機會報告三條過海隧道實施分時段收費後的交通情況及成效。

議題一：隧道及主幹道收費檢視

我們之前推行三隧分流和大欖隧道（新收費方案），在議會內外向很多議員和社會論述時，聽到很清晰的意見，就是希望政府可以全面、整全地有一致性的原則，就政府隧道和主幹道收費給予社會一個清晰的方向。

總括而言，政府按四大原則釐定隧道收費，包括交通管理需要、公交優先、效率優先及「用者自付」，同時亦會慎重考慮市民的負擔能力。

根據四大原則，我們按優次檢視收費基礎和水平，綜合考慮各條隧道及主幹道的個別具體情況，權衡各個原則的比重。我們今日提出的建議，就是先行調整香港仔隧道及城門隧道，以及就即將開通的中九龍繞道徵收適量的隧道費，以達致有效的交通管理，而同時合乎「用者自付」的營運原則。

（一）香港仔隧道及城門隧道

我們進行了比較。香港仔隧道、城門隧道相比其替代路線行程一般較短及便捷，而兩者的替代路線目前仍有剩餘容量應付車流，加上兩條隧道已34年沒有調整收費，其營運和維修成本有所增加。以二○二四至二五年為例，香港仔隧道的營運赤字已高達1,800萬元，而城門隧道的營運赤字亦高達5,200萬元。假設所有車種全日劃一收費由5元調整至8元，預計對交通管理影響輕微，同時可達致維持收支平衡，所以我們認為有必要、亦有空間優先調整這兩條隧道的收費。

（二）中九龍繞道

即將開通的中九龍繞道會分階段開通，首先於今年年底開通油麻地隧道段，亦爭取大約在明年年中可望開通九龍灣隧道段。中九龍繞道的功能是紓緩現時九龍主要幹路的交通擠塞情況。例如，九龍灣至油麻地的行車時間由現時約30分鐘大大縮減至約五分鐘，因為使用中九龍繞道的路程短、車速高，節省燃料費和時間，預計對用家有非常大吸引力。我們預計中九龍繞道剛開通時繁忙時段的使用率已接近飽和。我們今次在文件內羅列了經檢視的三個收費情景供大家聚焦討論：（i）免費；（ii）固定17元收費，以達致收支平衡；（iii）固定10元收費。

在此我想解釋多些有關我們對交通管理的評估。政府於二○一七年籌備中九龍繞道工務工程項目時，我們估算繞道在不收費的情景下，繁忙時段行車量／容車量比率達約0.9。根據最新二○二六年的預計人口估算，中九龍繞道附近一帶，包括九龍東及將軍澳的總人口比當年估算上升約6%，最新的交通數據亦顯示九龍東西走向主要道路車流量亦比當年上升約15%。因此我們最新評估顯示，中九龍繞道開通時，車流會比當年預計為高，預計在繁忙時間達到0.97，即一開通，繁忙時間使用率會接近飽和。因此，從交通管理角度而言，我們有需要重新審視透過收費為中九龍繞道預留空間的需要；例如在10元收費情景之下，有關行車量／容車量比率約為八成，對新開通的道路是相對健康的情況。

再者，我們自二○二三年開始實施「易通行」，應用了科技，於是可以大大克服在市區密集的地方，例如中九龍繞道附近，未必有空間預留位置作收費廣場。的確科技給予我們靈活性，有更多空間和彈性，透過有效的交通管理措施，包括收費，推行有效的交通管理方案。

中九龍繞道項目投入了大量資源興建，至於營運和維護方面也會比一般道路為高，因為它全長八公里，其中七公里都是隧道，通風大樓、照明設施，以至交通管理信號系統，都會比一般道路為高。徵收10元隧道費的情景之下，約收回九成基本營運費用。綜合以上考慮，我們認為就中九龍繞道徵收適量費用不但可預留約兩成剩餘容量作很需要的、交通管理上的緩衝空間，以應付交通增長，同時能夠分流九龍中多條繁忙幹道的兩成交通，亦可在充分顧及市民的負擔能力的前提下，在一定程度上收回成本。

10元收費情景是希望在四大原則之下作出平衡，亦希望達到情理兼備。同事稍後會就每個情景的預期交通效果和收入情況向大家分享，我在此先不詳述。

至於其他隧道及主幹道，我們一樣應用了剛才所羅列的四大原則，就每條隧道和主幹道逐一審視。我們在會議文件中已羅列我們的考慮。總括而言，我們建議就每組隧道及主幹道，在期望日後會有更充分的交通配套，例如新替代路線及其他交通管理條件較成熟和優良的前提下，暫時維持現有安排，適時再作檢視。

（三）立法時間表

我們希望藉此機會與大家充分討論，爭取於今個立法年度內向立法會提交各附屬法例修訂。香港仔隧道和城門隧道的新收費預計可於立法會完成審議後一個月內實施；至於中九龍繞道，我們爭取於二○二六年年中全線開通，同步開始收費。

議題二：三條過海隧道的檢視

政府自二○二三年十二月起在三條過海隧道實施分時段收費，目的是遏抑和分散繁忙時段的交通需求，藉此理順過海交通，善用三條過海隧道的容車量。新收費實施後，整體過海隧道擠塞情況有所紓緩，隧道口附近非隧道交通明顯改善，有效達到預期的政策目標。

以西隧（西區海底隧道）為例，全日（車流量）增加19%，達到10萬4千架次；紅隧（紅磡海底隧道）全日車流量減少9%，達到9萬6千架次；東隧（東區海底隧道）亦下降7%，現時全日7萬3千架次。至於這些隧道的車龍——因為對駕駛者來說，排隊、車流比較明顯及相關——我們看到紅隧現時繁忙時間車龍縮減了一公里，東隧縮減了0.5公里，西隧輕微增加了0.4公里。

正正因為三隧分流的效果非常顯著，我相信委員都觀察到西隧的繁忙時間車流比以前明顯增加，在西隧港島出口有需要在道路作出理順。現時我們正如火如荼進行工程，在港島出口左邊增建一條行車線，明年工程完成後可令西隧南行的車流更暢順。由於看到現時分流效果顯著，西隧的車流一路增加，亦要在交通硬件設施作出配套安排，我們審視後建議暫時維持各車種收費和繁忙時段安排，讓我們可繼續持續密切監察交通情況，適時調節。

接下來，我想邀請運輸署同事以數張投影片為大家詳細介紹。希望稍後與大家互動交流，盡量回答議員的關注和意見。多謝主席。"

  The Bill seeks to amend the Betting Duty Ordinance (Cap. 108) and relevant subsidiary legislation to provide for a regulatory framework for basketball betting, which includes granting the power to the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs to issue a licence for conducting basketball betting and to impose licensing conditions; the calculation and collection of betting duty (which is charged at 50 per cent of the net stake receipts, same as that for the football betting duty); and expanding the functions of the Betting and Lotteries Commission to cover matters relating to the regulation of basketball betting.

A spokesman for the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau said, ""As a matter of policy, the Government does not encourage gambling. The Government adopts a multipronged strategy to address gambling-related problems, including law enforcement against illegal gambling activities, public education on the harms of gambling addiction, provision of counselling and support services for people in need, as well as regulation of gambling activities through legislation. On the regulation of gambling activities through legislation, the policy objective of providing authorised gambling outlets is to address the public demand for certain gambling activities,preventing people from turning to illegal operators.""

The spokesman added, ""If the Bill is enacted, we will, by making reference to the current regime of horse race betting and football betting, issue a licence for basketball betting to the Hong Kong Jockey Club, and to impose licensing conditions so as to minimise the negative impact of gambling on the public, especially on young people.

  ""We will continue to closely collaborate with the Ping Wo Fund Advisory Committee to strengthen publicity and counselling for young people. To this end, in addition to the existing four funded counselling centres, we will allocate additional resources to establish a new centre dedicated to providing counselling and support services for youth. Public education efforts will also be strengthened to emphasise to young people that participating in illegal gambling or placing bets with an illegal bookmaker is already a criminal offence.""

The Bill will be introduced into the Legislative Council for first reading on July 2."

《條例草案》旨在修訂《博彩稅條例》（第108章）及相關附屬法例，訂立籃球博彩的規管框架，包括賦權民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長發出營運籃球博彩的牌照並施加牌照條件、博彩稅的計算和徵收方法（即徵收淨投注金的50%，與現時足球博彩稅率相同），以及擴大博彩及獎券事務委員會的職能以涵蓋與籃球博彩相關的監管事宜。

民青局發言人表示：「政府一貫的政策是不鼓勵賭博。針對賭博問題，政府採取多管齊下的策略，包括透過執法打擊非法賭博活動、透過公眾教育宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害、為有需要人士提供輔導和支援服務，以及透過法例規管賭博活動。在透過法例規管賭博活動方面，政府提供合法賭博途徑的目的，在於回應市民對某些賭博活動的需求，以免他們轉向非法的經營者下注。」

發言人補充：「若《條例草案》獲通過，我們將會參考現時賽馬和足球博彩的模式，向香港賽馬會發出籃球博彩牌照，並制定相關牌照條件，以進一步減少賭博對市民（尤其是青少年）的不良影響。」

「我們亦會繼續與平和基金諮詢委員會緊密合作，加強對青少年的宣傳及輔導工作。為此，在現時資助的四間輔導中心以外，我們會增撥資源，設立專注於為青少年提供輔導及支援服務的新中心。我們亦會加強透過公眾教育提醒青少年，參與非法賭博，向非法收受賭注者投注已屬違法。」

Basic Housing Units Bill gazetted,2025-06-20 09:20,2025-06-20 09:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000014.htm,"â  The Government gazetted today (June 20) the Basic Housing Units (BHUs) Bill (the Bill), which seeks to introduce a regulatory regime for the letting of subdivided units (SDUs) in residential buildings for ensuring the provision of reasonable and safe living conditions in SDUs, thereby tackling the ""long-standing, big and difficult"" issue of substandard SDUs in an orderly and comprehensive manner. The Bill will be introduced into the Legislative Council (LegCo) for first and second readings on July 9.

 The Bill requires SDUs in residential buildings to comply with a set of minimum standards of living conditions, including internal floor area, headroom, fire safety, structural safety (i.e. loading), lighting and ventilation, toilet, water supply point, as well as water and electricity meters, and to obtain BHU recognition before they are allowed to be let out for habitation. There would be criminal liability on the person who lets out unrecognised SDUs, while the tenants concerned will not be held liable.

 A Government spokesperson said, ""As a transitional arrangement to implement the BHU regulatory regime progressively, the Government will set up a 12-month registration system for residential flats with pre-existing SDUs, under which a 36-month grace period will be provided to SDUs in registered flats for carrying out necessary alteration works and making applications for BHU recognition. Unregistered SDUs, registered SDUs with grace period expired, as well as new SDUs entering the market must apply for recognition as up-to-standard BHUs before they can be lawfully let out for habitation.""

 The spokesperson added, ""Since the establishment of the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units in October 2023, the Government has extensively consulted various stakeholders on the handling of the SDU issue. A two-month stakeholder consultation exercise was conducted in December 2024 on the legislative proposals for the BHU regulatory regime. The LegCo Panel on Housing was also consulted in December 2024 and March 2025 respectively. During the period, nearly 40 engagement sessions were organised with nearly 700 participants met, and a total of some 2 200 written submissions of views (including around 1 600 template submissions) were received. Stakeholders generally supported the policy objective and legislative framework of the BHU regulatory regime. The Bill has suitably reflected the views received. Overall speaking, stakeholders and society have responded positively to the legislative proposals.""

  The Government will make every effort to facilitate the LegCo's scrutiny work and strive for the LegCo's passage of the Bill as soon as possible, with a view to rolling out the BHU regulatory regime in March 2026, which represents a significant milestone in eradicating substandard SDUs."
《簡樸房條例草案》刊憲,2025-06-20 09:20,2025-06-20 09:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000013.htm,"​政府今日（六月二十日）在憲報刊登《簡樸房條例草案》（《條例草案》），旨在為出租住宅樓宇分間單位引入規管制度，以確保分間單位能提供安全和合理的居住環境，全面有序處理劣質「劏房」這個「老大難」的問題。《條例草案》將於七月九日提交立法會進行首讀及二讀。

《條例草案》要求住宅樓宇分間單位須符合一系列有關居住環境的最低標準，包括內部樓面面積、樓底淨高度、消防安全、結構安全（即荷載）、照明及通風、廁所、供水點及水電錶等，以及取得「簡樸房」認證，方可合法出租作居住用途。如有人將未獲認證的分間單位出租便要負上刑事責任，而相關租客則不會涉及法律責任。

政府發言人表示，作為逐步落實「簡樸房」規管制度的過渡安排，政府會為現存分間單位所處的住宅單位設立為期12個月的登記制度，並給予為期36個月的寬限期，讓已登記住宅單位內的分間單位進行所需的改造工程和申請「簡樸房」認證。沒有登記的分間單位、已登記但寬限期屆滿的分間單位，以及新進入市場的分間單位，均須申請認證成為合標準的「簡樸房」，方可合法出租作居住用途。

發言人補充：「政府自二○二三年十月成立『解決劏房問題』工作組以來，就解決『劏房』問題廣泛諮詢不同持份者，並於二○二四年十二月就『簡樸房』規管制度立法建議進行了為期兩個月的持份者諮詢，以及分別在二○二四年十二月和二○二五年三月諮詢立法會房屋事務委員會，其間合共舉辦了近40場會議、與近700人次會面，以及收到約2 200份書面意見（當中包括約1 600份範本意見書）。持份者普遍認同「簡樸房」規管制度的政策目標和立法框架，《條例草案》已適當地反映了收到的意見。整體來說，持份者及社會對立法反應正面。」

政府會全力配合立法會的審議工作，爭取立法會盡快通過《條例草案》，以期在二○二六年三月推行「簡樸房」規管制度，為告別劣質「劏房」踏出具有重大意義的一步。"

Josephine (Chair of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, Ms Josephine Orgill), Consul-General Gareth Williams (Consul-General of Australia to Hong Kong and Macao), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is a pleasure to be with you tonight as we celebrate the 37th anniversary of AustCham in Hong Kong.

Let me begin by extending my heartfelt congratulations to you all. For nearly four decades, you have evolved from a casual lunch club into the largest offshore Australian Chamber of Commerce.

And through your Community Awards, you not only honour excellence in sustainability, women's leadership, sports, entertainment and entrepreneurship; you have also strengthened the vibrant ties between Hong Kong and Australia.

We value your friendship, your contributions and your wise counsel over the years.

Tonight's celebration brings back fond memories of my visit to Australia last September. I was moved by the energy, the innovation and the genuine enthusiasm of Australian businesses to deepen collaboration with Hong Kong. The potential for partnership is vast and growing.

  Trade and investment are cornerstones of our relationship. Since the Hong Kong–Australia Free Trade Agreement and the Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement came into force in 2020, our economic ties have continued to flourish. The merchandise trade between us grew by 5 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter this year.

And we have a diverse and vibrant community of about 160 Australian companies in Hong Kong who have contributed to the dynamism of the city's business scene and economic progress. And the 10 000 Australian nationals residing in Hong Kong, who have brought with them experience and expertise in various fields ranging from finance and education to legal services, construction engineering and more.

For example, I trust you would be proud of the significant involvement of Australian companies in the building and management of our world-class Kai Tak Sports Park.

As a staunch advocate of free trade, Hong Kong is eager to contribute more to regional trade and economic integration. Our application to join RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, underscores that commitment. We are grateful for AustCham's support all the way, and we look forward to Australia's active endorsement as well.

In a world challenged by rising unilateralism and protectionism, like-minded economies must come together. Hong Kong and Australia share a firm commitment to a rules-based multilateral trading system. That shared belief is the foundation for stronger co-operation and mutual prosperity.

Of course, our ties go beyond trade. Our people-to-people exchanges are thriving. In the first five months of this year, nearly 200 000 Australian visitors came to Hong Kong, a 35 per cent increase year-on-year. These visits not only help promote mutual understanding, but also lay the foundation for long-term collaboration in business and beyond.

  Ladies and gentlemen, looking into the future, Hong Kong continues to offer a world-class and unique platform for Australian companies seeking access to the vast Chinese Mainland market.

  Our commitment to the ""one country, two systems"" framework remains firm and steadfast. This is the foundation that underpins our competitiveness. As consistently acknowledged in various international rankings, Hong Kong continues to perform well in government efficiency, business environment, rule of law, infrastructure and connectivity, quality education, lifestyle and more. These strengths have made Hong Kong a highly attractive destination for global businesses.

Indeed, in recent months we have seen a notable inflow of international capital into Hong Kong. Our stock market is gaining momentum, and bank deposits have risen by over 7 per cent last year, and another 4 per cent so far this year, reaching HK$18 trillion. These are strong indicators of renewed confidence in our markets and the opportunities offered by this city.

In March, a new amendment to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) came into force. This brings good news for Australian businesses. Two key highlights: first, Australian companies established in Hong Kong can benefit from immediate priority access to the Mainland market. Second, they can opt for common law and choose Hong Kong as the place of arbitration for eligible contracts within the Greater Bay Area.

Hong Kong is also charting an ambitious path forward. From major infrastructure projects like the Northern Metropolis, to innovation and technology development, to deeper economic integration with the Greater Bay Area, the opportunities are vast. We warmly welcome our Australian friends to be part of this exciting journey.

「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽在上海舉行,2025-06-19 20:20,2025-06-19 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900286.htm,"由香港特別行政區政府新聞處（新聞處）舉辦的「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽今日（六月十九日）在上海展開，利用互動藝術科技，展示香港獨有的魅力和活力。

展覽主題為「香港─實踐理想，開創未來」，由新聞處與香港特別行政區政府駐上海經濟貿易辦事處（駐滬辦）合辦，歡迎上海和長三角地區民眾親臨參觀，探索香港在旅遊、教育、營商和投資方面的獨特機遇和潛力。

「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽設有五個主題展區，分別為「國際金融中心」、「創新及科技樞紐」、「澎湃創意之都」、「多元和綠色城市」及「體育動感之都」，各有代表香港的虛擬場景，為參觀者提供沉浸式體驗，透過多重互動藝術投影、燈箱和裸眼3D裝置，呈現香港各方面的魅力。

參觀者亦可透過香港本地藝術家Messy Desk（李美欣）的插畫設計，在拍照區感受香港充滿活力和璀璨的海濱面貌。展覽場地同時播放香港宣傳短片和設有數碼展板，介紹香港多項資訊，以及內地企業在香港的體驗，向參觀者展示香港作為全球最適合旅遊、就學、居住、工作和投資的城市之一所具備的元素。

新聞處處長廖李可期在今日舉行的開幕禮上致辭時表示，巡迴展覽今年於內地三個「一帶一路」重要節點城市舉行，首站是上海，其後是青島和成都。

她說：「香港跟上海是國家的兩顆明珠，分別是粵港澳大灣區及長三角經濟圈的核心城市。多年來，滬港兩地的交流合作成果豐碩。以經貿為例，香港既是上海的主要出口市場，亦是上海最大的外商投資來源地。」

廖李可期補充說，滬港兩地的文化藝術交流亦淵源深遠。她表示，香港西九文化管理局與多個上海藝文機構合作呈獻的「2025上海西九文化周」正在舉行，並得到上海市政府鼎力支持，向上海觀眾展現香港文藝發展的嶄新面貌。她期待是次「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽達至聯乘效應。

廖李可期亦介紹是次展覽的亮點，包括特別設置「體育動感之都」展區，作為香港與澳門及廣東省在今年十一月合辦第十五屆全國運動會的預熱宣傳，以及首次加入國寶大熊貓的場景，讓大家可以透過裸眼3D展示和互動遊戲等藝術科技，與國寶一同體驗香港作為「盛事之都」的活力。

她期望藉着這個展覽吸引内地的朋友認識香港、到訪香港的興趣，以至日後前來香港經商投資、就業創業，為香港進一步注入發展動能。

此外，兩位才華橫溢的香港青年音樂家──口琴演奏家何卓彥及鋼琴演奏家駱敬武──將於六月二十一日在展覽場地獻上精彩的爵士樂演奏，讓參觀人士體驗香港文化。

展覽期間亦會舉行「酷遊香港─沉浸式之旅」快拍留影互動遊戲。兩名勝出者可獲得由國泰航空贊助的豐富獎品，頭獎為雙人來回上海至香港商務客艙機票，二獎為雙人來回上海至香港經濟客艙機票。

展覽於上海大型港資商場新天地時尚一期舉行，展期至六月二十九日，參觀者可免費入場。

上海是巡迴展覽的第六站。此前新聞處於二○二三年七月至二○二五年一月期間在內地、東南亞國家聯盟和中東數個城市，成功舉行這個巡迴展覽。

除駐滬辦外，是次展覽的支持機構亦包括商務及經濟發展局「一帶一路」辦公室、香港人才服務辦公室、國泰航空、香港貿易發展局、香港旅遊發展局、​啟德體育園及香港西九文化管理局。

"""Immersive Hong Kong"" roving exhibition opens in Shanghai",2025-06-19 20:20,2025-06-19 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900277.htm,"The ""Immersive Hong Kong"" roving exhibition, organised by the Information Services Department (ISD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to showcase the charm and vibrancy of Hong Kong through interactive art technology, opened in Shanghai today (June 19).

  Co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai (Shanghai ETO) and with the theme of ""Hong Kong - Where the World Looks Ahead"", the exhibition invites visitors from Shanghai and the Yangtze River Delta to explore the unique opportunities and potential for tourism, education, business and investment in Hong Kong.

  The exhibition enables visitors to delve into different virtual scenes representing the city, with a creative twist. The five thematic zones, namely ""Financial Bridgehead"", ""I&T Brain Bank"", ""Blossoming Creativity"", ""Diversity and Greenery"" and ""Buzzing Sports Action"", feature multiple interactive art projections, light box installations and naked-eye 3D displays, representing the multifaceted appeal of Hong Kong.

  Visitors may also enjoy Hong Kong's vibrant and colourful skyline, illustrated by Hong Kong artist Messy Desk (Jane Lee), at a photo corner in the venue. Promotional videos on Hong Kong and digital panels with information about the city, as well as insights from Mainland companies about their experiences in Hong Kong, are also on display, explaining why the city is one of the most desirable places to visit, study, live, work and invest.

  Speaking at the opening ceremony today, the Director of Information Services, Mrs Apollonia Liu, said that the exhibition will be held in three Mainland key node cities along the Belt and Road with Shanghai as the first stop, followed by Qingdao and Chengdu.

  She said, ""Hong Kong and Shanghai are two pearls of the country, one being the core city in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the other being the leading city in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration. There have been many fruitful outcomes from Shanghai-Hong Kong co-operation over the years. Taking economic and trade ties as an example, Hong Kong is Shanghai's major export market and Shanghai's largest source of investment outside Mainland China.""

Mrs Liu added that Shanghai and Hong Kong enjoy close arts and cultural ties, noting that the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority is also staging their WestK Shanghai Week 2025 in co-operation with a number of arts institutions in Shanghai and with the staunch support of the Shanghai Municipal Government to showcase the new landscape of Hong Kong's arts and cultural development. She looked forward that WestK Shanghai Week 2025 would achieve a synergistic effect with the ""Immersive Hong Kong"" roving exhibition.

  Introducing the highlights of the exhibition, Mrs Liu said that the thematic zone ""Buzzing Sports Action"" was especially set up to serve as pre-event publicity for the 15th National Games to be co-hosted by Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macao in November this year. She also said that China's national treasures, giant pandas, are featured in naked-eye 3D displays and interactive games for the first time, inviting visitors to experience the vibrancy of Hong Kong as an ""events capital"".

Mrs Liu hoped that the exhibition could attract friends from the Mainland to learn more about Hong Kong and spark their interest in visiting the city, and come to Hong Kong in future for business and investment, employment and entrepreneurship, injecting impetus to the further growth of Hong Kong.

To give Shanghai audiences a taste of Hong Kong's cultural offerings, a jazz performance by two young Hong Kong music talents, harmonicist Cy Leo and pianist Freeman Lok, will be staged at the exhibition venue on June 21.

  An interactive game, ""Snap a cool shot @Immersive Hong Kong"", which will be held during the exhibition period, will offer attractive prizes sponsored by Cathay Pacific for two winners. The winner of the Grand Prize will receive a pair of round-trip business class air tickets from Shanghai to Hong Kong, while the runner-up will receive a pair of round-trip economy class air tickets of the same itinerary.

The exhibition is being held at Xintiandi Style I, a major Hong Kong-based shopping centre in Shanghai, until June 29. Admission is free.

Shanghai is the sixth stop of the exhibition, following its successful staging by the ISD in cities on the Mainland, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Middle East between July 2023 and January 2025.

  In addition to the Shanghai ETO, other supporting organisations of the exhibition include the Belt and Road Office of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Hong Kong Talent Engage, Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the Kai Tak Sports Park and the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority.

At the ceremony, the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat, said that Hong Kong Customs, as the gatekeeper of Hong Kong, strives to intercept contrabands from entering or transhipping through Hong Kong. Despite the immense daily flow of people and goods, Hong Kong Customs, with the unfailing support from the industries, is confident in facing any challenges and maintains efficient enforcement. Meanwhile, Customs will continue to roll out various trade facilitation measures and proactively deepen the multilateral co-operation with other administrations, in its capacity as the Vice-Chair for the Asia/Pacific Region of the World Customs Organization, to formulate policies that will facilitate customs clearance. All these show Customs is committed to standing with industries in the face of different challenges and building a conducive business environment.

The awardees this year came from various sectors, including express couriers, logistics companies, shipping agencies, container terminal operators, co-working space operators, and trademark representatives. The diversity of stakeholders showcases the close co-operation and connection between Customs and different enterprises. The department will continue to collaborate with industries and uphold the mission of safeguarding the gate of Hong Kong and facilitating legitimate trade."

衞生防護中心更新抗菌素指引　倡議醫生恰當處方抗菌藥物（附圖）,2025-06-19 17:48,2025-06-19 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900341.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（六月十九日）正式推出名為《效果》的新版抗菌素指引（只備英文版），讓全港醫生為住院病人處方抗菌藥物時作為參考，避免過度使用抗菌藥物，導致抗菌素耐藥性的問題加劇。

中心的顧問醫生（抗菌素耐藥性）馬紹強醫生說：「鑑於抗菌素耐藥性情況不斷演變，中心聯同多位專家，根據本地抗菌素耐藥性數據，並按照最新的國際和本地文獻修訂了指引，供醫生參考，以便可以更精準地處方抗菌藥物。中心今日特別舉辦了一場論壇，為超過150名與會的公私營醫護人員介紹指引的主要更新內容，包括常見傳染病的治療藥物、針對已知病原體的抗菌藥物，及預防手術感染的藥物建議。新版指引亦闡述了個別抗菌藥物的建議劑量和不良反應。」

除了為業界舉辦論壇外，中心今日亦已去信全港醫生，呼籲他們參考新指引，為有需要的病人處方合適的抗菌藥物，以進一步遏止耐藥問題擴散，並保障現有治療方法的有效性。

馬紹強醫生說：「抗菌素耐藥性是指微生物（如細菌、病毒）演變成能抵抗原本有效的藥物。感染耐藥性細菌的病人的患病時間會因而延長，甚至會增加死亡風險，而濫用和過度使用抗生素，是導致產生耐藥性細菌的主要因素。《效果》自一九九九年首次制訂以來，成為醫護人員重要的參考指引，有助減少不必要或不適當的抗菌藥物處方。同時，指引已成為公立醫院推行「抗生素導向計劃」的關鍵基礎，亦能便利往後在私家醫院提升相應的措施。最新監測資料顯示，本港「謹慎使用類」抗菌素（世界衞生組織認定為較大機會引發耐藥性的抗菌素）佔全港抗菌素的供應量，從二○一六年的40.3%降至二○二四年的34.6%，顯示醫生相對較少處方廣譜抗生素，有助應對抗菌素耐藥性的問題。」

政府一直高度重視應對抗菌素耐藥性的必要性，於二○二二年發表第二份《香港抗菌素耐藥性策略及行動計劃》（《行動計劃》），為二○二三年至二○二七年制訂應對抗菌素耐藥性威脅而採取的策略，工作措施包括檢討和更新《效果》抗菌素指引，並提醒醫生按照指引和基於實證為病人處方抗菌素。

今次已是推出《效果》以來第六次更新，由中心、醫院管理局、香港大學李嘉誠醫學院、香港中文大學醫學院、香港醫學會及香港私家醫院聯會合作編製。中心謹此向總編輯何栢良醫生、胡德超醫生及編輯委員會成員表達謝意。

中心同時呼籲市民遵照以下建議，與醫護人員合力消弭抗菌素耐藥性的問題：


若染上傷風、感冒或2019冠狀病毒病，應就醫，切勿在沒有處方的情況下，自行到藥房購買抗生素服用；
不要向醫生要求抗生素。只有在醫生建議下，才服用抗生素，並須完成整個療程。即使症狀有所改善，也不應自行停用抗生素；
留意和遵循藥物袋上註明的注意事項，採取適當的感染控制措施，例如經常保持手部衞生、出現呼吸道症狀時佩戴外科口罩、妥善消毒和覆蓋所有傷口，以防止服用抗生素時耐藥菌以「人傳人」方式傳播；
接種季節性流感疫苗和2019冠狀病毒病疫苗，是預防二次感染細菌的有效方法，從而減少使用抗生素，避免出現抗菌素耐藥性；
注意從即食食品中感染抗藥性細菌的風險。服用抗生素或抗酸劑的人，以及高危人士（例如孕婦、嬰幼兒、長者和免疫力弱的人），應避免食用生或未經徹底煮熟的即食食品；及
在廚房處理食物時，應保持良好的衞生習慣，減少耐藥性細菌交叉感染的風險。

CHP updates antimicrobial guidelines and urges doctors to prescribe antimicrobials appropriately (with photos),2025-06-19 17:48,2025-06-19 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900342.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (June 19) launched a new edition of antimicrobial guidelines entitled the Interhospital Multi-disciplinary Programme on Antimicrobial ChemoTherapy (IMPACT) Guidelines. These guidelines serve as a reference for doctors when prescribing antimicrobial drugs for inpatients, aiming to prevent overuse which may aggravate antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

""In view of the evolving AMR situations, the CHP in collaboration with experts updated IMPACT based on local AMR data and the latest international and local literature for reference of doctors so that antimicrobials can be prescribed in a more accurate manner. The CHP organised a forum today to introduce the major updates of the guidelines, including the empirical therapy of common infections, antimicrobials for known pathogens and recommendations for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis to over 150 participating healthcare professionals from the public and private sectors. Recommended dosing and adverse reactions for certain antimicrobials are also set out in the updated guidelines,"" said the Consultant (Antimicrobial Resistance) of the Infection Control Branch of the CHP, Dr Edmond Ma.

In addition to the forum for the medical field, the CHP also issued a Letter to Doctors today, urging them to refer to the new guidelines and prescribe the appropriate antimicrobials to patients in need. This will help curb the spread of drug resistance and safeguard the effectiveness of existing treatments.

Dr Ma added, ""AMR occurs when microorganisms (such as bacteria and viruses) evolve and become resistant to previously effective medications.When patients are infected with drug-resistant bacteria, their illness may be prolonged, and their risk of death may even increase. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics are the major drivers of drug-resistant bacteria. Since the first edition of the IMPACT Guidelines was launched in 1999, it has become an important reference for healthcare professionals, helping to minimise unnecessary or inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobials. At the same time, it has become a key foundation for launching the Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme in public hospitals and will facilitate the enhancement of relevant measures in private hospitals in the future. According to the latest surveillance data, the proportion of antimicrobials in the Watch category (i.e. antimicrobials considered by the World Health Organization to be at a higher risk of developing drug resistance) in the total supply of antimicrobials in Hong Kong decreased from 40.3 per cent in 2016 to 34.6 per cent in 2024, indicating that doctors are prescribing relatively fewer broad spectrum antibiotics to help combat AMR.""

The Government has been placing great importance on addressing the necessity of combating AMR. In 2022, the Government published the second Hong Kong Strategy and Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (Action Plan), outlining strategies to tackle the threat of AMR from 2023 to 2027.The measures include reviewing and updating IMPACT, and reminding doctors to prescribe antimicrobials to patients in accordance with guidelines and scientific evidence.

The IMPACT set of guidelines, now in its 6th edition, are a collaborative effort among the CHP, the Hospital Authority, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Medical Association and the Hong Kong Private Hospitals Association. The CHP would like to express its sincere gratitude to the Editors, Dr Ho Pak-leung, Dr Wu Tak-chiu, and the other members of the Editorial Board.

The CHP also urged members of the public to work with healthcare professionals to eliminate AMR by observing the following:


Consult a doctor when having a cold, flu or COVID-19. Do not buy antibiotics without a prescription at community pharmacies;
Do not demand antibiotics from doctors. Only take antibiotics when advised by doctors and complete the whole course of treatment even if symptoms have improved;
Follow health advice stated on the prescription bag and adopt appropriate infection control measures such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing a surgical mask when having respiratory symptoms, and disinfecting and covering all wounds properly to prevent person-to-person spread of resistant bacteria when taking antibiotics;
Receive seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines as effective means to prevent secondary bacterial infection, hence reducing the use of antibiotics and occurrence of AMR;
Be aware of the risk of acquiring resistant bacteria from ready-to-eat (RTE) food. People taking antibiotics or antacids, and high-risk populations (such as pregnant women, infants and young children, the elderly and people with weakened immunity) are of higher risk and should avoid eating raw or undercooked RTE foods; and
Observe good hygienic practices in the kitchen when handling food to minimise the risk of cross-contamination by resistant bacteria.

留意和遵循藥物袋上註明的注意事項，採取適當的感染控制措施，例如經常保持手部衞生、出現呼吸道症狀時佩戴外科口罩、妥善消毒和覆蓋所有傷口，以防止服用抗生素時耐藥菌以「人傳人」方式傳播；
接種季節性流感疫苗和2019冠狀病毒病疫苗，是預防二次感染細菌的有效方法，從而減少使用抗生素，避免出現抗菌素耐藥性；
注意從即食食品中感染抗藥性細菌的風險。服用抗生素或抗酸劑的人，以及高危人士（例如孕婦、嬰幼兒、長者和免疫力弱的人），應避免食用生或未經徹底煮熟的即食食品；及
在廚房處理食物時，應保持良好的衞生習慣，減少耐藥性細菌交叉感染的風險。

CHP updates antimicrobial guidelines and urges doctors to prescribe antimicrobials appropriately,2025-06-19 17:48,2025-06-19 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/19/P2025061900342.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (June 19) launched a new edition of antimicrobial guidelines entitled the Interhospital Multi-disciplinary Programme on Antimicrobial ChemoTherapy (IMPACT) Guidelines. These guidelines serve as a reference for doctors when prescribing antimicrobial drugs for inpatients, aiming to prevent overuse which may aggravate antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

""In view of the evolving AMR situations, the CHP in collaboration with experts updated IMPACT based on local AMR data and the latest international and local literature for reference of doctors so that antimicrobials can be prescribed in a more accurate manner. The CHP organised a forum today to introduce the major updates of the guidelines, including the empirical therapy of common infections, antimicrobials for known pathogens and recommendations for surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis to over 150 participating healthcare professionals from the public and private sectors. Recommended dosing and adverse reactions for certain antimicrobials are also set out in the updated guidelines,"" said the Consultant (Antimicrobial Resistance) of the Infection Control Branch of the CHP, Dr Edmond Ma.

In addition to the forum for the medical field, the CHP also issued a Letter to Doctors today, urging them to refer to the new guidelines and prescribe the appropriate antimicrobials to patients in need. This will help curb the spread of drug resistance and safeguard the effectiveness of existing treatments.

Dr Ma added, ""AMR occurs when microorganisms (such as bacteria and viruses) evolve and become resistant to previously effective medications.When patients are infected with drug-resistant bacteria, their illness may be prolonged, and their risk of death may even increase. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics are the major drivers of drug-resistant bacteria. Since the first edition of the IMPACT Guidelines was launched in 1999, it has become an important reference for healthcare professionals, helping to minimise unnecessary or inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobials. At the same time, it has become a key foundation for launching the Antimicrobial Stewardship Programme in public hospitals and will facilitate the enhancement of relevant measures in private hospitals in the future. According to the latest surveillance data, the proportion of antimicrobials in the Watch category (i.e. antimicrobials considered by the World Health Organization to be at a higher risk of developing drug resistance) in the total supply of antimicrobials in Hong Kong decreased from 40.3 per cent in 2016 to 34.6 per cent in 2024, indicating that doctors are prescribing relatively fewer broad spectrum antibiotics to help combat AMR.""

The Government has been placing great importance on addressing the necessity of combating AMR. In 2022, the Government published the second Hong Kong Strategy and Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (Action Plan), outlining strategies to tackle the threat of AMR from 2023 to 2027.The measures include reviewing and updating IMPACT, and reminding doctors to prescribe antimicrobials to patients in accordance with guidelines and scientific evidence.

The IMPACT set of guidelines, now in its 6th edition, are a collaborative effort among the CHP, the Hospital Authority, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Medical Association and the Hong Kong Private Hospitals Association. The CHP would like to express its sincere gratitude to the Editors, Dr Ho Pak-leung, Dr Wu Tak-chiu, and the other members of the Editorial Board.

The CHP also urged members of the public to work with healthcare professionals to eliminate AMR by observing the following:


Consult a doctor when having a cold, flu or COVID-19. Do not buy antibiotics without a prescription at community pharmacies;
Do not demand antibiotics from doctors. Only take antibiotics when advised by doctors and complete the whole course of treatment even if symptoms have improved;
Follow health advice stated on the prescription bag and adopt appropriate infection control measures such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing a surgical mask when having respiratory symptoms, and disinfecting and covering all wounds properly to prevent person-to-person spread of resistant bacteria when taking antibiotics;
Receive seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines as effective means to prevent secondary bacterial infection, hence reducing the use of antibiotics and occurrence of AMR;
Be aware of the risk of acquiring resistant bacteria from ready-to-eat (RTE) food. People taking antibiotics or antacids, and high-risk populations (such as pregnant women, infants and young children, the elderly and people with weakened immunity) are of higher risk and should avoid eating raw or undercooked RTE foods; and
Observe good hygienic practices in the kitchen when handling food to minimise the risk of cross-contamination by resistant bacteria.
