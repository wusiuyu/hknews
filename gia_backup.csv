After winning the Smart Business Grand Award with ""SMore ViMo - AI Vision Model Development & Deployment Platform"", the SmartMore Corporation Limited also claimed the highest honour of this year's competition.

Addressing the presentation ceremony, Mr Chan said, ""The Hong Kong ICT Awards sets new benchmarks for excellence, inspires both seasoned professionals and budding talent to expand their imagination, push the boundaries of technology, and create innovative solutions to address society's pain points and challenges.""

Noting that a Best Use of AI Award was featured again across all eight categories of this year’s Hong Kong ICT Awards, Mr Chan pointed out the growing importance of AI in every sector. He said that’s why the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has made AI a focus of its innovation and technology strategy, to develop it as a core industry, and to promote it as an enabler to upgrade traditional sectors.

The Hong Kong ICT Awards aims to recognise and promote outstanding local Information and Communications Technology ICT innovations and applications. It has been well-received as an annual flagship event of the local industry since its debut in 2006. In addition to encouraging and recognising local innovation, the Awards also serve as a springboard to help the winners and their products enter the Chinese Mainland and overseas markets.

The Chairman of the Grand Judging Panel and the President of Hong Kong Metropolitan University, Professor Paul Lam, congratulated the awardees and praised their outstanding innovative projects and ideas, which demonstrate excellence in enhancing the quality of life and delivering benefits to society.

Professor Lam said, ""This year’s awardees have leveraged innovative ideas and cutting-edge technologies, combined with industry expertise, to present practical and creative solutions for an array of commercial and social challenges. I look forward to witnessing the successful implementation of their ideas. I am confident that they will profoundly benefit both businesses and communities, creating a positive impact on society.""

Speech by FS at Awards Presentation Ceremony of the Hong Kong ICT Awards 2025 (English only) ,2025-11-21 19:40,2025-11-21 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100767.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Awards Presentation Ceremony of the Hong Kong ICT Awards 2025 today (November 21):

Professor Paul Lam (Chairman of the Grand Judging Panel of the Hong Kong ICT Awards 2025 and the President of Hong Kong Metropolitan University, Professor Paul Lam), è¬å¯§å¯é¨é· (the Deputy Director-General of the Youth Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Ms Wan Ning), Professor Sun Dong (Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong), ladies and gentlemen,

  Good evening. I'm pleased to join you once again for the annual HKICT Awards Presentation Ceremony.

  Tonight, we celebrate the remarkable achievements of innovators whose contributions in ICT are making a real difference for us, across the Government, public sectors, businesses and the society at large.

  These pioneers have made public services better and more accessible, enhanced business competitiveness, and driven breakthroughs in various areas ranging from digital entertainment and fintech to smart business and smart mobility. Their efforts are delivering benefits to our community.

  In just a few minutes, we will honour these outstanding achievers. But the significance of the Hong Kong ICT Awards extends far beyond recognition. It sets new benchmarks for excellence, inspires both seasoned professionals and budding talent to expand their imagination, push the boundaries of technology, and create innovative solutions to address society's pain points and challenges.

  This year, once again, a ""Best Use of AI Award"" is featured across all eight categories, highlighting AI's growing importance in every sector. Indeed, few forces today are as transformative as AI. That's why the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has made AI a focus of our innovation and technology strategy, to develop it as a core industry, and to promote it as an enabler to upgrade traditional sectors.

  Our approach is built on six key pillars: computing power, algorithms, data, real-world application scenarios, capital and talent. Together, a vibrant and interconnected ecosystem will be formed to enable AI applications to scale and deliver maximum impact.

  Hong Kong, together with the Greater Bay Area, holds a unique strength: it is where high-end manufacturing capabilities and cutting-edge AI innovation simultaneously reside. This is an advantage not even possessed by Silicon Valley. It means that AI solutions developed in the GBA can be tested, applied and validated seamlessly in real-world industrial settings.

  Ladies and gentlemen, our innovation and technology ecosystem is thriving. The Northern Metropolis is fast emerging as a major hub for the I&T sector, and we are expediting its development. Just yesterday, we released the Conceptual Outline for the Innovation and Technology Industry in San Tin Technopole, with specific initiatives to unleash its full potential. Meanwhile, the development of a data facility cluster at Sandy Ridge is also progressing, with tendering for advanced computing power facilities already launched in October.

  To the students and young innovators among us: innovation and technology is a career worth pursuing, not only for the opportunities it offers, but also for the impact you can make. It is a force for good, capable of transforming lives, economies and societies. The most rewarding moments often come when your ideas make a real difference for the world.

  Now, Hong Kong's start-up ecosystem is more vibrant than ever. We are home to over 4,700 startups, rising by 40 per cent compared to five years ago. Many are residing in Science Park and Cyberport, which provide them with incubation, funding and market development support. From digital entertainment and fintech to smart mobility and smart living, innovators and startups in Hong Kong are thriving not only locally, but are also making their mark across regional and global markets.

  I'm very pleased that you are part of this exciting journey. The opportunities ahead are boundless for you to seize.

  Finally, allow me to extend my sincere appreciation to the organisers of the event, and to the distinguished judges who have so generously contributed their time and expertise.

  Congratulations once again to all the award winners. Your achievements inspire us all, and you are at a new starting point to make an even greater impact for the good of humanity.

  Before I close, allow me to remind everyone of an important upcoming event -December 7, the Legislative Council Election. By casting your vote, we together will help shape a more prosperous future for Hong Kong.

  I wish you good health and continued success, and a most enjoyable evening. Thank you very much."

Import of poultry meat and products from areas in Belgium and Germany suspended,2025-11-21 18:43,2025-11-21 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100490.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (November 21) that in view of notifications from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) about outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Limburg Province in Belgium, and the District of Verden of the State of Niedersachsen and the District of Recklinghausen of the State of Nordrhein-Westfalen in Germany, the CFS has instructed the trade to suspend the import of poultry meat and products (including poultry eggs) from the above-mentioned areas with immediate effect to protect public health in Hong Kong.

A CFS spokesman said that according to the Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong imported about 30 tonnes of frozen poultry meat from Belgium, and about 60 tonnes of frozen poultry meat from Germany in the first nine months of this year.

""The CFS has contacted the Belgian and German authorities over the issues and will closely monitor information issued by the WOAH and the relevant authorities on the avian influenza outbreaks. Appropriate action will be taken in response to the development of the situation,"" the spokesman said."
反非法勞工行動拘四十五人（附圖）,2025-11-21 18:30,2025-11-21 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100655.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十一月十四日至昨日（十一月二十日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「圍網行動」、「曙光行動」、聯同勞工處進行的「彩虹行動」以及聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」。截至昨日，行動中共拘捕三十三名懷疑非法勞工及十名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及兩名涉嫌逾期逗留人士。

於「圍網行動」中，入境處調查人員發現有被解僱、或提前終止合約的外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在香港逾期逗留，並從事非法工作。經過深入調查及情報分析，成功鎖定及搜查多個目標地點，包括餐廳、酒樓和食物製造廠等，共拘捕二十四名懷疑非法勞工、八名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及兩名涉嫌逾期逗留人士。被捕的懷疑非法勞工分別為一男二十三女，年齡介乎二十二至五十二歲。當中十三名為逾期逗留的前外傭、十名為持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）人士及一名逾期逗留的訪港旅客。被捕的懷疑非法勞工主要從事洗碗、清潔及廚房雜工等工作。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為七男一女，年齡介乎二十七至六十四歲。

於其他反非法勞工行動中，調查人員亦搜查了多個目標地點，包括按摩店、裝修中單位及零售店等，共拘捕九名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為七男兩女，年齡介乎三十七至六十歲，當中兩男一女涉嫌行使及管有懷疑偽造身份證或他人身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩名女子，年齡分別為五十二及六十五歲。

有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

45 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-11-21 18:30,2025-11-21 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100661.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Blockade"" and ""Twilight"", a joint operation with the Labour Department codenamed ""Rainbow"" and joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"" from November 14 to yesterday (November 20). A total of 33 suspected illegal workers, 10 suspected employers and two overstayers were arrested.

  During operation ""Blockade"", ImmD investigators discovered that foreign domestic helpers (FDHs), whose employment contracts were prematurely terminated, have been overstaying in Hong Kong while taking up illegal employment. After a thorough investigation and intelligence analysis, the ImmD successfully identified and raided multiple target locations, including restaurants and food production plants. Twenty-four suspected illegal workers, eight suspected employers and two overstayers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised one man and 23 women, aged 22 to 52. Among them, 13 persons were overstaying former FDHs, 10 persons were holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong, and one person was an overstayer who was permitted to enter Hong Kong on a visitor status. The arrested illegal workers included dishwashers, cleaners and kitchen workers etc. Seven men and one woman, aged 27 to 64, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  During other anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations including massage parlours, renovation flats and retail stores etc. Nine suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised seven men and two women, aged 37 to 60. Among them, two men and one woman were also suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card or an identity card related to another person. Two Hong Kong female residents, aged 52 and 65, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or an identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit the ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡、香港金融管理局（金管局）副總裁陳維民、中銀香港副董事長兼總裁孫煜和中國工商銀行（亞洲）董事長兼執行董事劉亞干博士一同見證社署署長杜永恒、中銀香港個人金融產品部總經理周國昌和中國工商銀行（亞洲）機構業務部總經理殷勤軍簽署合作備忘錄。

孫玉菡表示很高興見到社署和兩家重要銀行合作，推出跨境發放可攜現金援助的全新安排。今日的儀式正式確立政府與兩家銀行的合作，以落實二○二五年《施政報告》的措施，便利在粵閩兩省養老的香港長者。他衷心感謝中銀香港和中國工商銀行（亞洲）以企業社會責任推進此跨境項目，在專業服務及資源方面全力支持。他亦十分感謝金管局大力推動，與銀行業界和內地監管當局緊密協調，促成新服務順利推出。

在粵閩兩省養老的香港社會保障受惠長者可申領政府的可攜現金援助，包括綜合社會保障援助（綜援）長者廣東及福建省養老計劃的綜援金，以及公共福利金計劃之廣東計劃和福建計劃的長者生活津貼和高齡津貼。現時現金援助由社署存入長者的香港銀行帳戶。近年，社署和金管局推出不同措施，便利香港長者在內地遙距辦理匯款及提款。

Social Welfare Department collaborates with banks to take forward cross-border disbursement arrangements for portable cash assistance (with photos),2025-11-21 18:28,2025-11-21 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100301.htm,"  The Social Welfare Department (SWD) signed today (November 21) Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with the Bank of China (Hong Kong) (BOCHK), and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) (ICBC (Asia)) respectively to establish a collaborative arrangement for the cross-border disbursement of portable cash assistance.

  The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun; Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Mr Darryl Chan; the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive of the BOCHK, Mr Sun Yu; and the Chairman and Executive Director of the ICBC (Asia), Dr Liu Yagan, witnessed the signing by the Director of Social Welfare, Mr Edward To; the General Manager, Personal Banking Product Department of the BOCHK, Mr Arnold Chow; and the Head of Institutions Department of the ICBC (Asia), Mr Yin Qinjun.

  Mr Chris Sun was pleased to see the SWD and the two major banks collaborate to launch a new arrangement for the cross-border disbursement of portable cash assistance. The ceremony today formally establishes the partnership between the Government and the two banks to implement the initiative outlined in the 2025 Policy Address to facilitate Hong Kong elderly recipients retiring in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the BOCHK and the ICBC (Asia) for taking forward this cross-border initiative with full support in professional services and resources, in realisation of their corporate social responsibility. He thanked the HKMA for its tremendous efforts and close co-ordination with the banking sector and regulatory authorities on the Mainland to facilitate the smooth launch of this new service.

  Hong Kong elderly recipients of social security who are residing in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces can apply for the Government's portable cash assistance, including the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) amount under the Portable CSSA Scheme, and the Old Age Living Allowance and the Old Age Allowance under the Guangdong Scheme and Fujian Scheme of the Social Security Allowance Scheme. Currently, the cash assistance is deposited into the Hong Kong bank accounts of the elderly recipients by the SWD. In recent years, the SWD and the HKMA have introduced various measures to facilitate remote remittances and withdrawals for Hong Kong elderly persons on the Mainland.

  To provide further convenience for the elderly concerned, the SWD will collaborate with the BOCHK and the ICBC (Asia) to launch a new service that allows Hong Kong elderly recipients of social security retiring in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces to opt to receive portable cash assistance from the SWD directly through their Mainland bank accounts with the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

  The new service for cross-border disbursement of portable cash assistance is expected to be officially launched in mid-next year. The SWD will announce further details in due course."

陳維民副總裁（香港金融管理局副總裁）、孫總裁（中國銀行（香港）副董事長兼總裁孫煜）、劉董事長（中國工商銀行（亞洲）董事長兼執行董事劉亞干博士）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

我很高興今日能親身見證社會福利署（社署）與中國銀行（香港）（中銀香港）和中國工商銀行（亞洲）簽署合作備忘錄。社署和兩家銀行首次攜手合作，實現直接跨境發放可攜現金援助，優化現金福利支付模式，目的是為居住內地的香港長者提供更大便利。

香港與內地持續深化合作，積極融入國家發展大局，當中尤以粵港澳大灣區作為重點。其中，促進跨境人流和資金流高效互通，是提升民生福祉的關鍵工作。

近年來，相信大家都有留意，兩地在跨境合作方面進行了大量工作，以社福為例，早年比較着重現金福利的可攜性，雖然聽起來好像較技術性，但其實大家都耳熟能詳，一個是綜援（綜合社會保障援助），涵蓋最窮困的長者；另一個是大家俗稱的「生果金」（高齡津貼）；以及大家都很關心的長者生活津貼。這三項現金福利其實早已實現了可攜性，但如果仔細看技術安排，其實每次是由社署將福利金匯到長者在香港的銀行戶口，長者自行在其銀行辦理匯款到內地使用。聽起來好像很流暢，但其實最理想的辦法是直接將他的福利金匯到他在内地的戶口，這是最簡單，也對長者來說是最大便利、最有好處的。

這次合作其實是要突破重要的最後一里路，我們非常感謝中銀香港、中國工商銀行（亞洲），在他們的大力支持下，再加上香港金融管理局的大力協助，終於可以實現這個重要的變化。聽起來好像小事一宗，但對於長者來說是大事一件，小事意義大，所以今日你看到參與見證的都是粒粒皆星的，兩間銀行的香港一把手，還有陳維民副總裁都親自來見證這件事，這亦顯示這件事意義非凡之處。

另外，我亦藉這個機會介紹一下，除了現金福利可攜之外，在實質服務提供方面，我們都用好了香港和大灣區之間的互補關係。相信大家都有留意廣東院舍照顧服務計劃（計劃）在過去數年發展迅速，到今日已經有24間，在大灣區不同城市的養老院都參與了這個計劃，為超過700位香港長者提供院舍服務。這個只是開始，我們相信隨着大家愈來愈了解大灣區在養老方面所發揮的作用，更多符合資助資格的香港長者會參與計劃。我們知道很多是自費到內地的，因為選擇較多，政府亦樂意提供協助和便利。兩間銀行提供的直接匯款到內地服務是免費的，這是非常重要。在這裏也多謝兩間銀行為社會責任作了很大的貢獻。

這項服務預計會在明年年中正式推出，政府會大力宣傳，令在內地養老的香港長者可以享受到這個便利。當然所有良好的政策都需要各界協助、合作，很高興見到商界在這次活動中給予大力支持。

要建設美好香港，重要的是有一個良好的行政立法關係，十二月七日就是立法會選舉，我相信大家都會全力支持。但我也想藉這個機會再一次呼籲各位，在十二月七日投下你神聖的一票或兩票，希望大家都用好你手上的選票，為香港的未來投下你神聖的一票，多謝大家。"

Noting that this year's NG is jointly hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao for the first time, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, expressed gratitude to the Central Government's trust and the General Administration of Sport of China's support, and congratulated Hong Kong, China athletes' on their historic achievements at the 15th NG. Mr Lee commended their excellent performance and perseverance, and thanked various sectors of the community for their support to the 15th NG and the athletes.

Mr Lee said, ""Since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has participated as a host city for the first time in this country's highest-level and largest-scale multisport event, marking a significant milestone in its sports development. The eight competition events and one mass participation event Hong Kong hosted, along with two cross-boundary events it co-hosted, aiming for the highest standards in preparations, were completed successfully. This fully demonstrated the close collaboration among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and reflected the country's firm support in collaborative developments in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), laying a solid foundation for hosting more major international mega events in the GBA.

""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) sent its largest-ever delegation to this year's NG. We are thrilled that Hong Kong athletes gave their utmost in the competitions and fully demonstrated their abilities, achieving historic results with a total of 19 medals, including nine gold, two silver, and eight bronze medals in sailing, cycling, tennis, swimming, rugby, triathlon and fencing. Their perseverance, outstanding performances, and professional sportsmanship have won them warm applause and high regard, making the people of Hong Kong and myself deeply encouraged, moved, and proud.

""Hong Kong athletes have excelled in multiple events at this year's NG. In addition to their training efforts, their success is also attributed to the selfless contributions of coaches from the Hong Kong Sports Institute, relevant National Sports Associations and their affiliated clubs, medical personnel and support teams. I recognise and appreciate their contributions. I would also like to thank various sectors of the community for their support and assistance to the 15th NG, ensuring the smooth running of events in the Hong Kong competition region. The enthusiastic cheers and applause from Hong Kong citizens, who wholeheartedly supported the athletes, have further boosted the community's passion for sports.""

Mr Lee remarked that the HKSAR Government has been sparing no effort in promoting sports development through the policy objectives of promoting sports in the community, supporting elite sports, maintaining Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events, enhancing professionalism, and developing sports as an industry. The HKSAR Government will leverage the successful experience of the 15th NG and continue to promote sports development through different initiatives. These include strengthening support for athletes, stepping up publicity in the community, leveraging advantages of the Kai Tak Sports Park, and attracting more international sports events to Hong Kong to drive the city's ""sports + mega events"" development. Hong Kong will further deepen co-operation with GBA cities, which will complement each other's strengths to jointly advance the development of sports and the sports industry in the GBA.

The 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games will be held from December 8 to 15, with Hong Kong hosting four competition events and one mass participation event. Mr Lee said that Hong Kong will continue to do its utmost in hosting the events to conduct a simple, safe and wonderful Games with Guangdong Province and Macao. He expressed his confidence that various sectors of society will continue to support Hong Kong athletes to shine in the events and showcase their indomitable spirit."

During the operation, Customs detected 29 related cases and seized a total of 120 000 suspected counterfeit goods, with a total estimated market value of about $65 million.

Amid the huge demand during the Double 11 Festival shopping period, Customs discovered that a large quantity of counterfeit and infringing goods were transshipped overseas via Hong Kong. Through intelligence analyses and comprehensive investigations, Customs officers during the abovementioned period carried out strike-and-search operations at logistics companies in Kwai Chung, Tsing Yi, Yuen Long, Tsuen Wan and Hong Kong InternationalAirport, and detected 29 cases. A total of about 120 000 suspected counterfeit goods, including watches, footwear, clothing, electronic goods and glasses with a total estimated market value of about $65 million were seized.

Investigations of the abovementioned cases are ongoing.

Customs appeals to consumers to purchase goods at reputable shops or websites and to check with the trademark owners, copyright owners or authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt to avoid buying counterfeit or infringing goods.

Customs reminds practitioners in the logistics industry to comply with the requirements of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO) and to check with the trademark owners or authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt when handling cargoes. The department also reminds traders or online sellers not to sell counterfeit or infringing goods and to be cautious and prudent in merchandising since selling counterfeit or infringing goods is a serious crime and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions.

Customs will continue to step up inspections and conduct intelligence-led enforcement to vigorously combat different types of counterfeit and infringing goods activities.

Under the TDO, any person who imports or exports or sells or possesses for sale any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Among the fourth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering four survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas in November, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released four batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in November 2025, covering 35 survey areas. Among these 35 survey areas, 27 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. October 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Eight other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

十一月份第四批涵蓋四個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及九個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十一月共四批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共35個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這35個監察區中，27個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有八區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

"DH urges members of public to maintain hygiene amid high level of activity of hand, foot and mouth disease",2025-11-21 16:00,2025-11-21 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100501.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 21) issued another letter to doctors and schools, updating them on the latest situation regarding hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and reminding them to watch for related symptoms among schoolchildren as the localactivity of HFMD has increased in recent days. Schools shouldreportany HFMD outbreak to the CHP immediately.

The CHP's latest surveillance data showed that the number of HFMD outbreaks in institutions/schools recordedhas gradually increased, from 17 outbreaks affecting 50 persons in the week between October 26 and November 1, to 20 outbreaks (affecting 53 persons) and 25 outbreaks (affecting 61 persons) per week in the recent two weeks (i.e. November 2 to 8 and November 9 to 15 respectively). During the first five days of this week (November 16 to 20), 16 outbreaks affecting 40 persons have been reported. Among the 78 HFMD outbreaks recorded from October 26 to November 20, 82 per cent (64 outbreaks) occurred in child care centres/kindergartens (CCC/KG) and primary schools.

Additionally, the CHP's sentinel surveillance based atCCC/KGandprivate medical practitioner clinicsrevealed that the HFMD consultation rates have remained high since late October of this year. There was also an upsurge in consultation rates for HFMD in the Accident and Emergency Departments of public hospitals last week.

""HFMD is a common disease in children caused by enteroviruses (EVs) such as Coxsackie virus and EV71. HFMD occurs year-round in Hong Kong, with peak seasons generally occurring from May to July and from October to December. Given that the activity of HFMD remains at a high level, parents should stay alert to the health conditions of their young children. While most HFMD patients have mild symptoms, three cases of severe paediatric enterovirus infection have been recorded so far this year, requiring hospitalisation. While all patients have recovered and been discharged, I hope that the public will not take this disease lightly,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

""Schools and institutions have a higher chance of encountering outbreaks as HFMD can spread more easily among young children who have closer contact with each other. Schools are reminded to follow theGuidelines on Prevention of Communicable Diseaseson preventive and control measures as well as management of outbreaks, which should be reported to the CHP for prompt follow-up. Management of venues with play facilities should also refer to the CHP'sPublic Health Advice for Play Facilitieson appropriate infection control in activities involving young children under6 during the peak season of HFMD,"" he added.

HFMD patients usually experience fever, poor appetite, tiredness and sore throat in the early stages of the illness. One to two days after the onset of fever, painful sores may develop in the mouth and often become ulcers. Most patients recover on their own within seven to 10 days.

 Dr Tsui stressed that alcohol does not effectively kill some viruses causing HFMD, for example, EV71. Therefore, alcohol-based handrubs should not be a substitute for washing hands with liquid soap and water.

To prevent HFMD, members of the public (especially those in the management of schools and institutions) should take heed of the following preventive measures:


Maintain good air circulation;
Keep hands clean and wash hands properly. Wash hands before meals, after going to the toilet, when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing, or after handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;
Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;
Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as furniture, toys and commonly shared items with 1:99 diluted household bleach (mixing one part of household bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite with 99 parts of water), leave for 15 to 30 minutes, and then rinse with water and keep dry;
Use absorbent disposable towels to wipe away obvious contaminants such as respiratory secretions, vomitus or excreta, and then disinfect the surface and neighbouring areas with 1:49 diluted household bleach (mixing one part of bleach containing 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite with 49 parts of water), leave for 15 to 30 minutes and then rinse with water and keep dry;
Avoid going to overcrowded places;
Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rashes have subsided and all vesicles have dried and crusted; and
Parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of sick children.


The CHP's weekly publication, EV SCAN, is issued every Friday to report the latest local situation of HFMD. Members of the public may also visit the CHP'spagefor more information onHFMD and EV71 infection."
本地手足口病活躍程度處於高水平　衞生署呼籲市民注意衞生,2025-11-21 16:00,2025-11-21 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100469.htm,"本地手足口病活躍程度近日持續上升，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十一日）再度向醫生和學校發信，呼籲他們留意手足口病的最新情況和學童有否出現相關症狀。學校如出現爆發個案，應盡快向中心呈報。

中心的最新監測數據顯示，院舍／學校的手足口病爆發個案由十月底（十月二十六日至十一月一日）一周的17宗（涉及50人），逐步上升至最近兩周（十一月二日至八日及十一月九日至十五日）的分別20宗（涉及53人）及25宗（涉及61人）。本周首五天（十一月十六日至二十日）中心已錄得16宗爆發個案，涉及40人。在十月二十六日至十一月二十日錄得的78宗爆發個案中，百分之八十二（64宗）的個案在幼兒中心、幼稚園和小學發生。

此外，中心的幼兒中心／幼稚園傳染病及私家醫生診所定點監測數據顯示，自今年十月下旬起，手足口病的求診率維持在高水平。上周公立醫院急症室手足口病的求診率亦顯著上升。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「手足口病是一種常見於兒童的疾病，通常由腸病毒（如柯薩奇病毒和腸病毒71型）引起。香港全年均會出現手足口病，高峰期一般為五月至七月及十月至十二月。鑑於手足口病活躍程度維持在高水平，家長應密切留意年幼子女的健康情況。雖然大部分手足口病患者的病徵都輕微，但今年至今共已錄得三宗兒童腸病毒感染嚴重個案，病人需要留院治理，雖然他們均已康復出院，但我希望市民不要掉以輕心。」

他續說：「幼童在學校和院舍內有較多密切接觸，令疾病更易傳播並較大機會出現爆發個案。學校須按照『預防傳染病指引』執行預防和控制措施，以及處理爆發個案。如有爆發個案，應呈報衞生防護中心適時跟進。遊戲場地管理人亦應參考中心發出的『遊戲設施的公共健康指引』，在手足口病高峰期舉辦涉及六歲以下幼童的活動時，做好適當的感染控制措施。」

手足口病患者在病發初期通常會出現發燒、食慾不振、疲倦和喉嚨痛。發燒後一至兩天口腔可能會出現疼痛的瘡，然後形成潰瘍，病人一般在七至10日內可自行痊癒。

徐樂堅醫生強調，酒精未能有效殺死一些引起手足口病的病毒，例如腸病毒71型，所以酒精搓手液並不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手。

要預防感染手足口病，市民（特別是學校及院舍人員）應採取以下措施：


保持空氣流通；
保持雙手清潔，並用正確方法洗手。飯前、如廁後、雙手被呼吸系統分泌物弄污後（如打噴嚏後），以及處理尿片或其他被糞便沾污的物品後，都應立即洗手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時要掩着口鼻，並妥善清理口鼻排出的分泌物；
經常清潔和消毒常接觸的物品表面，如傢俬、玩具和共用物件。使用1比99稀釋家用漂白水（即把1份含5.25%次氯酸鈉的漂白水與99份清水混和）消毒，待15至30分鐘後，用水清洗並抹乾；
用吸水力強的即棄抹巾清理可見的污物，如呼吸道分泌物、嘔吐物或排泄物，然後用1比49稀釋家用漂白水（即把1份含5.25%次氯酸鈉的漂白水與49份清水混和）消毒被污染的地方及鄰近各處，待15至30分鐘後，用水清洗並抹乾；
減少到人多擠迫的地方；
病童應留在家中，直至發燒及紅疹消退，以及所有水疱結痂後才回校上課；及
家長應與學校保持密切聯繫，讓校方知悉病童的最新情況。


中心逢星期五會透過周報《腸病毒透視》匯報本地手足口病的最新情況。市民亦可參閱中心的專頁，了解更多有關手足口病及腸病毒71型感染的詳情。"

EPD ensures water quality for 15th National Games triathlon competition and Cross Harbour Race (with photos),2025-11-21 15:40,2025-11-21 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100480.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) is committed to protecting and enhancing the water quality of Victoria Harbour through strengthened monitoring, inspections, and interdepartmental collaboration, ensuring its compliance with the stringent standards required for international competitions.

  A spokesman for the EPD said today (November 21) that the 15th National Games triathlon competition was successfully held November 15 and 16 at the Central Harbourfront Event Space and Victoria Harbour, with beautiful scenery and excellent water quality in full compliance with the water quality requirements for the triathlon competition, underscoring the effectiveness of the EPD's efforts in water quality improvement and management. In preparation for the Cross Harbour Race to be held tomorrow (November 22), the department continues to strengthen relevant measures to ensure the event proceeds smoothly in a clean and high-quality water environment.

  As the core area of Hong Kong, Victoria Harbour once suffered from poor water quality due to sewage discharge caused by rapid population growth and commercial activities. To restore the harbour's cleanliness, the Government launched in 2001 the largest environmental infrastructure project in Hong Kong's history - the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS). The project comprised construction of deep tunnels conveying the sewage generated from both sides of the harbour to the Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works for centralised chemically enhanced primary treatment and disinfection before discharge. Following the full operation of HATS in late 2015, sewage from both sides of the harbour has been properly treated. This has resulted in a significant reduction in pollutants in the harbour, including reduction of E. coli levels by more than 90 per cent. In recent years, the overall Water Quality Objectives compliance rate for Victoria Harbour has increased to over 90 per cent.

  In addition to HATS, the Government has also taken vigorous actions to resolve near-shore pollution problems. In recent years, efforts have been stepped up to investigate sewer misconnections along different districts of Victoria Harbour, and undertook rapid repairs of ageing sewers and rectification of misconnections. Through interdepartmental collaboration, as at the end of 2024, the overall pollution load at highly polluted stormwater drainage outfalls along the harbour, including in areas such as Tsuen Wan, Sham Shui Po and Kowloon City, had been reduced by about 87 per cent, surpassing the key performance indicator set in the 2022 Policy Address, which aimed to reduce by half the pollution load at stormwater drainage outfalls with serious pollution problems on both sides of Victoria Harbour by the end of 2024.

  The Cross Harbour Race, suspended since 1979 due to poor water quality, was resumed in 2011 and returned to the central part of Victoria Harbour in 2017. In recent years, the harbour's water quality has remained good and stable, allowing the 2024 World Triathlon Cup - Hong Kong, the 2024 Asia Triathlon U15 & Youth Championships, Asia Cup Hong Kong, and the 2025 Asia Triathlon Sprint Championships Hong Kong to be successfully staged at the Central and Wan Chai promenade.

  In readiness for national and international mega events, a cross-departmental government team, including the EPD, undertook preparations a year ahead of the official competitions. Measures included enhanced monitoring of the water quality of the racecourse in the harbour and collecting seawater samples for testing of important water quality parameters. For effective planning and implementation of various pollution interception and water quality improvement measures, the EPD also proactively used advanced smart technologies (including the new generation of a 3D hydrodynamic and water quality model) and analysed the latest weather data to simulate and predict the detailed water quality and hydrological conditions of the racecourse during race events. Meanwhile, the EPD, Drainage Services Department and Buildings Department have been promptly rectifing ageing public sewer and sewer misconnections. Various sewage interception and odour mitigation measures have been implemented along the Central and Wan Chai harbourfront. The EPD has been conducting comprehensive pollution investigations in various districts along the shoreline for intercepting pollutants at sources from entering Victoria Harbour. From 2022 up to October 2025, about 1 700 expedient connection surveys were carried out in the major catchments of the Central and Wan Chai harbourfront. In addition, over 4 500 manholes were inspected and more than 1 100 water samples were analysed. Monitoring instruments have been employed to proactively track odour levels at the harbourfront. Working with the Marine Department, the EPD strengthened monitoring of harbour cleanliness and stepped up the removal of floating refuse, ensuring that race events took place in excellent water quality and a clean environment. Over the past year, repeated sampling tests have confirmed that Victoria Harbour's water quality fully met the stringent standards required for the 15th National Games triathlon competition.

  ""Athletes in the 15th National Games triathlon competition and the Cross Harbour Race competing with confidence in Victoria Harbour is the clearest recognition of Hong Kong's water quality improvements by both athletes and the public. The successful staging of these two major sporting events in excellent water quality and a clean environment also stands as a testament to the Government's untiring efforts in water quality enhancement. The EPD will continue to work closely with relevant departments to advance sewage infrastructure, strengthen pollution control, and implement improvement measures, ensuring the ongoing protection and enhancement of the water quality of Victoria Harbour. These efforts will enable more water sports to be safely held in this world-class harbour and waters nearby, offering Hong Kong people a better living environment and leisure experience,"" the spokesperson added."

41名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-11-21 15:30,2025-11-21 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100532.htm,"41名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於十一月十四日及今日（十一月二十一日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款介乎800元至6,000元，合計罰款共82,200元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 318宗個案，而就法庭已處理的983宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及860名分間單位業主，合計總罰款共2,621,210元，另有335宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該41名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；及（二）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

41 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-11-21 15:30,2025-11-21 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100528.htm,"  Forty-one landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $800 and $6,000, amounting to a total of $82,200, on November 14 and today (November 21) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 318 cases to date. Among the 983 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 860 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,621,210 in fine. In addition, 335 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 41 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon a comprehensive investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to enable SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."

Government announces results of invitation for joint proposals to operate pilot scheme on sports dispute resolution,2025-11-21 15:00,2025-11-21 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100321.htm,"The Department of Justice (DoJ) today (November 21) announced the results of the invitation for joint proposals for the operation of a pilot scheme on sports dispute resolution. The AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre and the eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre have been selected to serve respectively as the administering body and the technology provider of the pilot scheme.

The pilot scheme is set to operate for a period of two years. It will provide a dedicated mechanism for resolving sports disputes through mediation and arbitration. The administering body will administer the pilot scheme and provide institutional support for the conduct of mediation and arbitration, including compiling specific mediation and arbitration rules, recruiting and appointing mediators and arbitrators, devising fee structures with the mediators and arbitrators and the parties, and administering the mediation and arbitration proceedings. The technology provider will provide the technological infrastructure and support required for the operation of the pilot scheme, with a view to promoting wider use of lawtech and online dispute resolution.

It is one of the policy initiatives of the Policy Address to establish a sports dispute resolution system and promote sports mediation and arbitration, leveraging the institutional advantages of Hong Kong in dispute resolution. The DoJ established the Advisory Committee on Sports Dispute Resolution, comprising representatives from the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong early this year. It also invited proposals from interested dispute resolution institutions and online dispute resolution institutions for the operation of the pilot scheme in June. The Advisory Committee then conducted a rigorous review of the proposals received based on a set of published assessment criteria.

The assessment criteria cover a wide range of aspects, including the proponents' institutional infrastructure and expertise in providing sports disputes resolution services and technology platforms for dispute resolution services; corporate governance; a mechanism for avoiding conflict in handling cases; local and regional networks for promoting sports dispute resolution; experience in training, public education and promotion related to sports dispute resolution; and acceptance of the requirement that only a reasonable filing fee will be charged to the parties in specified subsidised cases for dispute resolution services provided under the pilot scheme.

âThe pilot scheme will be launched by the end of this year, and the two selected institutions will immediately commence relevant preparation work. The DoJ will announce further details of the pilot scheme in due course."

Andrea（《香港01》行政總裁蘇曉婷）、馮先生（《香港01》首席媒體戰略官馮德雄）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

我很榮幸再次獲邀擔任金融科技前瞻研討會暨01金融科技卓領大獎頒獎禮的主禮嘉賓。

《香港01》連續第五年舉辦這項研討會，可以說是見證了香港金融科技的蓬勃發展。雖然今日談的是前瞻，但在談未來之前，也讓我們一起看看倒後鏡，了解過去五年的情況。五年前，為早着先機，政府成立了由我親自領導的金融科技項目執行統籌小組，整全地檢視及督導金融科技發展，確保政策及監管制度可以更有前瞻性。我們也透過多項計劃培訓金融科技人才，以及鼓勵金融創新和加快科技轉型。到二○二二年，我們發表首份虛擬資產在港發展的政策宣言，明確表述政府發展相關行業和生態圈的政策和方針。二○二三年，數字資產交易平台發牌制度開始實施。同年以及接着的二○二四年，政府先後兩次發行代幣化綠色債券，而香港金融管理局（金管局）亦於二○二四年推出Ensemble項目沙盒，聯同證監會（證券及期貨事務監察委員會）及Ensemble項目架構工作小組的其他成員共同測試不同代幣化用例。來到今年二○二五年，證監會二月發布了「ASPIRe」路線圖，加強數字資產巿場的安全性、創新和增長。六月，政府發表《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》（《政策宣言2.0》），更具體就構建值得信賴和着重創新的數字資產生態圈提出不同措施。

凡此種種，你可以看到政府一直積極推動金融科技發展的部署和決心。我們的努力在國際上也得到高度認可，今年九月發布的《全球金融中心指數》報告就評選香港的金融科技水平為全球第一。

本月初舉行的香港金融科技周 x StartmeupHK創業節2025吸引了超過45 000與會者，超過120個經濟體，匯聚1 000多位演講嘉賓，超過800家參展商，以及30多個內地及國際貿易代表團出席，創下歷史新高。相較五年前，無論是與會者人數，還是參展商人數都翻倍。這都印證我們的措施有效拓展香港的國際影響力，對國際金融科技投資者和人才都充滿吸引力，進一步鞏固香港作為亞洲領先金融科技樞紐的地位。

今年研討會的主題是「數字資產新紀元──機遇、挑戰與香港的領航之路」。在現今全球數字資產市場持續演化、傳統金融步入數字資產時代的背景下，這個主題實在非常切合時宜。

要做到在金融科技領域領航，我認為先要明白一個很重要的三元關係，那就是技術、應用場景和潛在風險這三大核心要素在推動金融科技發展進程中的重要性，這樣我們才能夠掌握到如何領航。

大家首要關注的一定是科技。金融科技依賴前沿技術的創新，大數據、人工智能、區塊鏈、雲計算、自動化等技術的突破為金融服務帶來更高的效率。以數字資產為例，它正是通過區塊鏈技術，賦能更高效和更低成本的金融交易及金融服務，成為金融科技重要且具發展潛力的一環。科技突破帶來的不僅是高效，也包括個性化服務和安全保障。《政策宣言2.0》開宗明義便指出，政府決心推動香港邁向成為全球數字資產領域的領導者，但原則是以風險管理及保障投資者為先，從而構建值得信賴和着重創新的數字資產生態圈。

三元關係的第二個元素是應用場景。要促進生態圈蓬勃發展，豐富的應用場景必不可少，否則技術都只會淪為空談。香港目前有超過1 200間金融科技公司，比我兩年前來這活動時的數量足足增長了約百分之二十。二○二三年當年我們約有1 000間金融科技公司。這些公司的業務越見多元化，涵蓋移動支付、跨境理財、人工智能金融服務顧問、財富及投資管理、合規科技、保險科技（InsurTech）和供應鏈金融等各個範疇。我們預期場景的多樣化會加速技術的普及和應用，賦能更多場景，推動普惠金融和綠色金融的擴展。其實今日的得獎者正正就提供了很多很好的應用場景，令金融科技有所應用。

譬如代幣化產品，政府便擔當領頭角色，繼二○二三年及二○二四年後，剛於上星期發行第三批代幣化綠色債券，發行總額創新高，達100億港元。是次發行是目前全球規模最大的代幣化債券發行，保留了以往發行的主要創新特性，包括以數碼原生形式發行、為投資者提供透過傳統市場基建參與買賣的選項，以及將綠色債券披露融入數字資產平台。與此同時，是次發行亦引入以人民幣及港元代幣化央行貨幣交收的選項，是全球首批在交收程序中應用這兩種代幣化央行貨幣的數碼債券。

另外，財庫局與金管局正共同推進就現行法例對於代幣化債券適用性的研究，以推動香港債券市場採用代幣化技術，詳情明年上半年便會公布。

金管局的Ensemble項目上星期亦正式進入試行階段，以EnsembleTX為名，聚焦推動市場參與者在代幣化貨幣市場基金交易中使用代幣化存款，即時管理流動性與資金需求。Ensemble項目從概念驗證升級為在可控的試行環境中進行真實交易，是香港推動代幣化進程的一個重要里程碑。EnsembleTX明年會持續運行，為下一階段創新奠定堅實基礎。試行環境會逐步升級優化，推動香港更廣闊的代幣化生態系統的持續發展。證監會將繼續與金管局緊密合作，推動代幣化技術在金融業內的進一步實際應用。

而政府最新的舉措就是與深圳市地方金融管理局在前日（十一月十九日）聯合發布行動方案，結合香港在金融科技領域的領先優勢與深圳的產業金融強項，從多方面加強兩地合作，當中包括推動深圳金融機構在港成立子公司、共建聯合孵化器、推動數字人民幣應用場景持續創新、共同培育金融科技人才等。我們的目標是在二○二七年年底前，落地超過20個深港跨境數據驗證平台金融領域應用場景，充分發揮深港兩地在金融科技的優勢，攜手打造全球金融科技中心。

伴隨着技術和場景的拓展，金融科技也會遇上三元關係中的第三元素，那就是風險，例如是資料安全與私隱保障、系統性風險、合規風險、網路安全威脅和操縱市場等問題。這正是三元關係中的最後一個但不容忽視的元素。風險管理不足可能限制技術和場景的健康發展，但若處理得當，技術創新就能不斷增強風險識別和管理能力。

因此，《政策宣言2.0》的重點之一便是優化法律與監管，為數字資產行業的可持續發展提供穩固基礎。繼前年實施數字資產交易平台發牌制度，《穩定幣條例》今年八月亦正式實施，訂下具法律效力的穩定幣發行人發牌監管制度。

作為國際金融中心，香港在進行規管時一如全球其他已發展經濟體的做法，都是秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則。在此原則下，在交易平台和穩定幣以外，我們亦正着力建立有關數字資產交易和託管服務提供者的發牌制度，目標於明年向立法會提交條例草案。在立法工作完成後，香港的監管框架將能全面涵蓋數字資產行業的主要節點，平衡風險管理和投資者保障，同時為市場發展和金融創新提供有利條件。

除此之外，金融監管機構亦定期檢討及優化數字資產的監管框架，例如證監會本月初剛發出兩份新通函，容許持牌虛擬資產交易平台與其海外關聯虛擬資產交易平台共享全球掛盤冊，令本地投資者更有效利用全球市場流動性，以及擴大虛擬資產交易平台就各類型的數字資產可提供的產品及服務範疇，以便利行業發展。

由此可見，金融科技的三元關係實際上是一個相互促進、相互牽制的系統，只有在技術安全、場景創新和風險控制之間找到平衡點，才能實現可持續、健康的行業發展。

現時，香港在「一國兩制」下發揮「防火牆」和「試驗田」的功能，憑藉內聯外通、國際化和多元包容等優勢，配合適當監管及清晰的路線圖，穩慎推進數字資產行業的發展。政府會把持好這三元關係的平衡點，與金融監管機構繼續着重風險為本，持續優化和建立一套既切合本地情況，又依循國際標準和慣例的監管制度，促進香港數字資產市場健康、負責任和可持續發展，進一步鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位。

除了討論金融科技及數字資產的發展，剛才Andrea也提到一件很重要的事，就是十二月七日舉行的第八屆立法會選舉。剛才我說的內容也談到數字資產和金融科技的工作都離不開立法，所以這方面與你們絕非無關的事，而是與各位的業務發展和香港的未來息息相關。十二月七日的選舉是香港完善選舉制度後的重要一步，對鞏固「一國兩制」行穩致遠，以及推動特區的良政善治，具有深遠意義。我呼籲各位在十二月七日行使公民權利，踴躍投票，選出理想人選，攜手推動香港，包括金融科技的穩步向前發展。

最後，我衷心祝願今日的研討會及頒獎禮圓滿成功，多謝各位！"

Speech by CE at Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon (English only) (with photos),2025-11-21 14:05,2025-11-21 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100392.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Hong Kong Association of Banks Distinguished Speaker Luncheon today (November 21):

Ms Mary Huen (Chairperson of the Hong Kong Association of Banks), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. I am pleased to join you, once again, for this Distinguished Speaker Luncheon. It brings together Hong Kong's financial industry leaders here today to share insights and intelligence on a wide variety of industry issues and developments.

  The Association now represents 149 high-profile member banks from 33 countries and regions. More than a tradition, this event is – and you are – a powerful testament to the vitality and ambition of Hong Kong's banking sector.

  Evidence of our collective progress is clear and compelling. From the beginning of the year to this September, bank deposits in Hong Kong went up more than 10 per cent, totalling some 2.4 trillion US Dollars.

  And Hong Kong continues to shine on the global stage, recently ranked again world's no. 1 in economic freedom by the Canadian-based Fraser Institute. We placed third in the World Competitiveness Yearbook, and third again in the Global Financial Centres Index.

  These and a good many other achievements demonstrate the resilience of our market and the dynamism you, our financial leaders, bring to Hong Kong. They reflect the confidence the international community places in our financial system, the rule of law and our future.

  A central pillar of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government's strategy for advancing Hong Kong's economic growth, is the strategic expansion of our international network.

  My participation, three weeks ago, in the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Economic Leaders' Meeting in Korea and the China International Import Expo in Shanghai underscore the immense value of these global partnerships.

  To better capitalise on Hong Kong's global connections, we launched the GoGlobal Task Force last month. This concerted, cross-sectoral Task Force will help to connect Mainland companies with global markets. Connecting Mainland companies with global markets is a key of my government's strategy this year and the years ahead. This will attract international capital and companies to Hong Kong.

  The initiative is designed to strengthen Hong Kong's position as the premier gateway for two-way investment and trade, reinforcing our role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

  Expanding our international network also means intensifying our focus on the economies of Southeast Asia. I am pleased to note that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is collaborating with your Association, as well as the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries. Together, you will lead delegations comprising banking representatives and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to explore business opportunities in key markets of the region.

  I'm also pleased to know that the Association is working to expand its connectivity, with ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) a particular focus this year.

  In boosting these connections, we open new markets. No less important, we build lasting economic ties to fuel Hong Kong's long-term growth.

  Of paramount importance to that bright future are our SMEs, which form the backbone of Hong Kong's economy. Supporting our 360,000 SMEs is critical to Hong Kong's overall development. To ensure that they thrive in this period of global economic uncertainty, we have introduced a wide variety of support measures.

  They include extending the application period for the 80 per cent Guarantee Product under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme for two years, with a one-year extension of the principal moratorium arrangement.

  I encourage banks to adopt a flexible and accommodating approach in processing loans by companies with a repayment ability. Together, we will work to ensure that temporary cash-flow challenges do not stifle or deter promising businesses.

  To fast-track that promising growth, we will also put the spotlight on driving innovation and efficiency. To promote digital trade, the Monetary Authority will develop a roadmap for Project CargoX by year's end, working with the Airport Authority Hong Kong and the Transport and Logistics Bureau's Port Community System. The Project will promote the use of authentic multi-modal cargo data in banking workflows, to reduce credit costs and processing times for both banks and SMEs.

  We are, as well, injecting 1.43 billion Hong Kong Dollars into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales, expanding its geographical scope to eight more economies, including Belt and Road countries. Concurrently, we are enhancing Cyberport's Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme. This will provide matching subsidies for SMEs adopting essential AI and cybersecurity solutions, future-proofing their operations in an increasingly digital world.

  A thriving market cannot be built on economic policies alone, however. It requires a foundation of trust and security. This is why our joint commitment to promoting anti-fraud education and combating financial crime is vital.

  As digital threats intensify, the banking sector's frontline role in educating and protecting customers, especially the elderly and other vulnerable groups, is an invaluable social safeguard.

  We welcome the Monetary Authority's ongoing development of relevant guidelines in collaboration with the industry. And the Association's establishment of the Anti-Fraud Education Taskforce, which has conducted over 110 outreach activities targeting different groups of the community, is encouraging.

  The Banking (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 began operation this month, to enhance the ability of banks to combat fraud through wider information sharing. The collaborative work between the Monetary Authority and the Police, using tools like the ""Scameter"" search engine, is also hampering criminal networks.

  Hong Kong takes a hard line against fraud and money laundering. Since the end of 2023, we have been applying to the courts, under relevant legal provisions, to seek enhanced penalties for cases involving stooge accounts. At last count, the sentences of 169 stooge account holders have risen, with terms of imprisonment ranging from 21 to 75 months. That's up at least 10 per cent and, in some cases, over 30 per cent than before.

  The Association's vigilance at the counter, together with your educational campaigns and collaboration with law enforcement, contribute substantially to the integrity and stability of Hong Kong's entire financial system.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the Government is committed to opening new markets, creating supportive environments for SMEs and ensuring a safe operating landscape. But the path to economic and market growth is a collective one.

  The active participation of the Association, and the banking sector in general, is essential to the development and progress of our great city. Your expertise and commitment are the very engines of Hong Kong's long-term prosperity.

  Also vital to Hong Kong's development is the upcoming Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election. The LegCo is vested with the power of enacting laws, examining and approving government budgets, and debating issues concerning public interests. I am glad to note that different banks and financial corporations have responded, positively, to the Government's call for action, and are providing facilitation measures to staff for voting in the election. I appeal to all of you, and your friends and families, to cast your vote on December 7th. Together, we will create a brighter future for Hong Kong.

  On that note, I wish you the best of business in the coming year. Thank you very much!"

環保署致力維護及改善維港水質　確保十五運會鐵人三項比賽和維港渡海泳順利舉行（附圖）,2025-11-21 12:58,2025-11-21 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100314.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）一直致力維護及改善維多利亞港（維港）的水質，透過加強監測、巡查及跨部門協作，確保水質符合相關國際比賽的嚴格標準。

環保署發言人今日（十一月二十一日）表示，第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）鐵人三項比賽於本月十五至十六日在中環海濱活動空間及維港順利完成，賽事期間水質優良，沿岸環境優美，十五運會鐵人三項賽的水質要求全面達標，充分展現環保署在水質改善及管理方面的成效。為迎接明日（十一月二十二日）舉行的維港渡海泳，環保署持續加強相關措施，務求賽事在水質優良及環境潔淨下順利舉行。

維港作為香港的核心區域，過去曾因人口和商業活動急劇增加帶來的污水排放而導致水質欠佳。為了讓維港重回潔淨，政府二○○一年進行了香港歷來最龐大的環保基建項目——「淨化海港計劃」，建設深層隧道把維港兩岸產生的污水輸往昂船洲污水處理廠進行中央化學強化一級處理及消毒後再作排放。「淨化海港計劃」於二○一五年底全面啓用後，維港兩岸的污水均得到妥善處理，海中污染物大幅下降，其中大腸桿菌含量降低逾九成。近年來，維港的水質指標整體達標率已上升至超逾90%。

除「淨化海港計劃」外，政府亦積極針對解決近岸污染問題，近年持續加強調查維港沿岸各區的污水渠錯駁，並快速修復老化污水渠及糾正污水渠管錯駁。在跨部門的共同合作下，截至二○二四年年底，在維港兩岸包括荃灣、深水埗及九龍城等地區有嚴重污染問題的雨水排水口的整體污染量已減少約87%，超越二○二二年《施政報告》訂立的績效指標（即在二○二四年年底前將維港兩岸相關地區有嚴重污染問題的排水口的污染量減半）。

曾因水質欠佳而自一九七九年起停辦的渡海泳，已於二○一一年起復辦，賽事更自二○一七年遷回維港中部舉行。近年維港水質保持良好穩定，2024三項鐵人世界盃—香港、2024年亞洲三項鐵人U15及少年錦標賽暨香港亞洲盃和2025年亞洲三項鐵人半奧運距離錦標賽—香港，相繼於中環和灣仔海濱成功舉行。

為全力支持全國及國際盛事，包括環保署在內的政府跨部門團隊早於正式賽事的一年前已展開籌備工作，包括加強維港賽道一帶近岸水域水質監測，並採集海水樣本檢測各項重要水質參數。環保署亦運用先進智慧科技（包括新一代的三維水動力和水質模型）及分析最新的天氣數據，詳細模擬預測賽事舉行時賽道的水質及水文狀況，以更有效部署和執行各項截污和水質改善措施。同時，環保署、渠務署與屋宇署提速提效修復老化污水渠及糾正污水渠管錯駁，於中環和灣仔沿岸一帶加設各項截污及氣味改善措施；為了堵截污染物流入維港，環保署持續於維港沿岸各區進行廣泛性污染源調查。自二○二二年至今年十月底，在中環和灣仔海濱重點集水區共進行了約1 700次污水渠錯駁調查，共檢查超過4 500個沙井，化驗了超過1 100個水樣本，及積極利用監測儀器定期於海濱進行氣味監測。環保署並聯同海事處加強監察海面潔淨情況及清理海漂垃圾，以確保賽事在水質優良及環境潔淨的情況下進行。過去一年，多次檢測均顯示維港水質全面符合全運會鐵人三項比賽的嚴格水質標準。

發言人說：「十五運會鐵人三項賽事和維港渡海泳的選手能安心盡情地在維港水域中參賽，正是運動員及市民對香港水質改善最直接的肯定。這兩項體壇盛事能在維港水質優良及環境潔淨情況下順利進行，也是政府多年來大力推動水質改善工作的豐碩成果。環保署會繼續與相關部門緊密合作，推動各項污水基建、污染管制及水質改善措施，持續維護和改善維港水質，讓更多水上活動得以在這片世界級海港及水域安全舉行，為市民帶來更優質的生活環境及休閒體驗。」"
​政務司司長在深圳出席十五運會總體運行情況新聞發布會（附圖／短片）,2025-11-21 12:10,2025-11-21 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100348.htm,"第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）組織委員會（組委會）副主任、香港特別行政區（特區）政府政務司司長陳國基今日（十一月二十一日）在深圳出席由十五運會組委會舉辦的新聞發布會，與國家體育總局、廣東省和澳門特區相關官員一同介紹十五運會的總體運行情況。 

陳國基在會上指出，今屆全國運動會（全運會）是廣東、香港、澳門三地在體育協作的創新實踐，展現了粵港澳大灣區共同發展的無限可能。全運會成功舉辦，不僅提升香港舉辦大型體育盛事的能力，更可推動大灣區城市的深度融合與協作，促進大灣區內的民心交流，為三地合作協辦大型盛事奠定堅實基礎，進一步提升大灣區的整體競爭力，共同為國家發展作出貢獻。 

就如何藉全運會的勢頭進一步推展香港體育產業的發展，陳國基表示，這次是香港自回歸祖國以來第八次參加全運會，亦是成績最好的一屆，一共取得9金2銀8銅，共19面獎牌。這些成績除了反映運動員的能力不斷提升外，也印證了香港在精英運動員培訓和體育政策方面的方向正確，同時展現特區政府與香港社會各界多年來攜手推動體育發展的成果。

陳國基說， 特區政府一直投放大量資源支持體育發展。二○二五至二六年度對香港體育學院的撥款預算超過10億港元，支援體院培訓超過1 600名精英運動員。除了提供實體訓練資源之外，政府也不斷完善對精英運動員的支援，包括提升運動員的直接資助金額，讓運動員可以在更穩定的經濟環境下專注訓練。

他續說，有着十五運會香港賽區各項賽事成功舉辦的經驗，特區政府會繼續積極吸引更多國際體育盛事在香港舉行，進一步推展香港體育事業，提高專業水平和向產業化方向發展，並借助大型盛事推動體育旅遊、周邊支援服務及相關創新服務，建構更完整的體育產業生態。特區政府亦會繼續加強在社區和學校層面推廣體育運動，增加和優化體育及康樂設施，鼓勵社會各界共同建立熱愛體育的文化。

陳國基說：「香港運動員在十五運會中創下歷史性佳績，為香港的體育發展帶來黃金機遇。特區政府會與社會各界齊心協力，將全運會的佳績轉化為長遠動力，進一步提升香港體育水平，加強推動全民運動的文化，讓體育成為凝聚社會、豐富文化生活的重要力量，達致『全運惠民』的理念。」

就舉辦全運會為香港帶來的正面影響，陳國基說，十五運會的圓滿舉辦不僅提升了整個大灣區包括香港的國際形象，更在基礎設施、人才培養和區域協作等多方面為香港帶來豐碩且深遠的成果，而這些成果將在十五運會完成後持續發揮積極作用，為香港的長遠發展注入新的動力。

他舉例說，在場館設施方面，啟德體育園等標誌性世界級設施，已成為推動香港體育與旅遊產業發展的重要平台。啟德體育園在十五運會期間成功舉辦七人制橄欖球、男子手球、擊劍等項目，展現舉辦國際大賽的能力。可容納五萬觀眾的主場館更顯著提升香港舉辦大型賽事的競爭力，進一步鞏固香港作為盛事之都的地位。

他續說，全運會的成功充分展示了香港在賽事組織和管理方面的能力。在賽事籌備過程中，香港培養了一批具備國際視野的專業人才，他們將持續在各相關領域發揮關鍵作用，推動和支撐香港體育事業的發展。此外，是次香港賽區共委任超過16 000名義工，組成了歷來最龐大的賽事義工團隊，充分展現市民對體育事業的積極參與和支持。這股強大的社會力量為香港體育的長遠發展奠定了堅實的社會基礎。

陳國基表示，全運會顯著提升了大灣區的整體國際形象和影響力，進一步鞏固香港在國際體育版圖上的地位，對促進旅遊、匯聚人才等方面帶來積極作用和實質效益。隨着全運會的成功舉辦，這些豐碩成果將轉化為推動香港發展、促進區域融合的強大動力，同時推動大灣區內的文化交流和經貿合作。

陳國基說：「香港會繼續與國家體育總局緊密合作，進一步推動粵港澳大灣區體育產業聯動發展，吸引更多大型賽事落戶香港和大灣區，為共建一流灣區、為國家體育強國的建設，貢獻香港力量。」

CS attends press conference on overall operations of 15th National Games in Shenzhen,2025-11-21 12:10,2025-11-21 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100350.htm,"  Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th National Games (NG) and Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, attended a press conference held by the Organising Committee of the 15th NG in Shenzhen today (November 21). Mr Chan, along with relevant officials from the General Administration of Sport of China (GASC), Guangdong Province and the Macao Special Administrative Region, introduced the overall operations of the 15th NG.

  Mr Chan stated at the press conference that this year's NG represents an innovative practice of sports collaboration among Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao, showcasing the infinite possibilities for the joint development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The successful hosting of the NG not only enhances Hong Kong's ability to host large-scale sporting events but also promotes deep integration and collaboration among GBA cities. It fosters people-to-people exchanges within the GBA and lays a solid foundation for the three places to cohost mega events, further enhancing the overall competitiveness of the GBA and jointly contributing to the country's development.

  Regarding how to further develop Hong Kong's sports industry by leveraging the momentum of the NG, Mr Chan noted that this marks the eighth time Hong Kong has participated in the NG since its return to the motherland, and it is also the most successful edition, with a total of 19 medals: nine golds, two silvers and eight bronzes. This not only reflects that the skills of athletes have been on the rise but also shows that Hong Kong is moving in the right direction in training elite athletes and formulating policies on sports developments. At the same time, it demonstrates the results of the joint efforts of the Government and various sectors of the community in promoting the development of sports over the years.

  Mr Chan said, the HKSAR Government has allocated abundant resources to support sports development. The Government has designated over $1 billion for the Hong Kong Sports Institute in 2025-26 to support its training for over 1 600 elite athletes. In addition to physical training resources, the Government continuously enhances support for elite athletes, including increasing the direct financial subsidies for athletes, allowing them to focus on training within a more financially stable context.

  He added, with the successful experience of hosting various events of the 15th NG in the Hong Kong competition region, the HKSAR Government will continue to actively attract more international mega sports events to Hong Kong, further promote the local sports industry, enhance professional levels and move towards industrialisation, as well as leverage large-scale events to boost sports tourism, related support services and relevant innovative services, with a view to building a more comprehensive sports industry ecosystem. The HKSAR Government will also continue to step up its promotion of sports at the community and school levels, increase and optimise sports and recreational facilities, and encourage all sectors to jointly cultivate a strong sporting culture.

  Mr Chan said, ""Hong Kong athletes have achieved historic results in the 15th NG, presenting a golden opportunity for Hong Kong's sports development. The HKSAR Government will work together with all sectors to convert the success of the NG into long-term momentum, further improving local sports standards and promoting a culture of 'sports for all'. This will position sports as a vital force in uniting society and enriching cultural life, aiming to achieve the goal of 'benefitting ordinary people'.""

  Regarding the positive impacts of hosting the NG for Hong Kong, Mr Chan said that the successful completion of 15th NG not only elevated the international image of the entire GBA, including Hong Kong, but has also resulted in substantial and lasting benefits in areas such as infrastructure, talent development and regional collaboration. These outcomes will continue to exert positive influence after the conclusion of the 15th NG, injecting new momentum into Hong Kong's long-term development.

  He cited that in terms of venues and facilities, iconic world-class facilities such as the Kai Tak Sports Park have become significant platforms for promoting Hong Kong's sports and tourism industries. The Kai Tak Sports Park successfully hosted events such as rugby sevens, handball (men) and fencing during the 15th NG, demonstrating its ability to host international competitions. Kai Tak Stadium, which accommodates 50 000 spectators, significantly enhances Hong Kong's competitiveness in hosting large-scale competitions, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as a hub for international mega events.

  He added that the success of the NG has fully showcased Hong Kong's capabilities in event organisation and management. During the preparation process, Hong Kong cultivated a group of professionals with a global perspective, who will continue to play key roles in related fields, promoting and supporting the development of Hong Kong's sports industry. In addition, the Hong Kong competition region has appointed over 16 000 volunteers, forming the largest-ever event volunteer team, which extensively demonstrates the public's active participation and support for the sports industry. This powerful social force has established a solid societal foundation for Hong Kong's long-term development of sports.

  Mr Chan noted that the NG has significantly enhanced the overall international image and influence of the GBA, further solidifying Hong Kong's status within the international sports arena. This has generated positive effects and tangible benefits in areas such as tourism promotion and talent attraction. With the successful hosting of the NG, these productive achievements will greatly contribute to Hong Kong's development and foster regional integration as powerful momentum, while promoting culture exchanges and trade collaboration in the GBA.

  Mr Chan said, ""Hong Kong will maintain close co-operation with the GASC to further promote the joint development of the sports industry in the GBA and attract more major events to be held in Hong Kong and the GBA, thereby contributing to building a world-class bay area and the country's efforts to become a sporting powerhouse.""

  Officials attending today's press conference included Deputy Director of the GASC Mr Tong Lixin; Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG and Standing Committee member of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, Mr Wang Xi; Mr Chan; and Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG and Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture of the Macao Special Administrative Region Government, Ms O Lam."

  Regarding the positive impacts of hosting the NG for Hong Kong, Mr Chan said that the successful completion of 15th NG not only elevated the international image of the entire GBA, including Hong Kong, but has also resulted in substantial and lasting benefits in areas such as infrastructure, talent development and regional collaboration. These outcomes will continue to exert positive influence after the conclusion of the 15th NG, injecting new momentum into Hong Kong's long-term development.

  He cited that in terms of venues and facilities, iconic world-class facilities such as the Kai Tak Sports Park have become significant platforms for promoting Hong Kong's sports and tourism industries. The Kai Tak Sports Park successfully hosted events such as rugby sevens, handball (men) and fencing during the 15th NG, demonstrating its ability to host international competitions. Kai Tak Stadium, which accommodates 50 000 spectators, significantly enhances Hong Kong's competitiveness in hosting large-scale competitions, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as a hub for international mega events.

  He added that the success of the NG has fully showcased Hong Kong's capabilities in event organisation and management. During the preparation process, Hong Kong cultivated a group of professionals with a global perspective, who will continue to play key roles in related fields, promoting and supporting the development of Hong Kong's sports industry. In addition, the Hong Kong competition region has appointed over 16 000 volunteers, forming the largest-ever event volunteer team, which extensively demonstrates the public's active participation and support for the sports industry. This powerful social force has established a solid societal foundation for Hong Kong's long-term development of sports.

  Mr Chan noted that the NG has significantly enhanced the overall international image and influence of the GBA, further solidifying Hong Kong's status within the international sports arena. This has generated positive effects and tangible benefits in areas such as tourism promotion and talent attraction. With the successful hosting of the NG, these productive achievements will greatly contribute to Hong Kong's development and foster regional integration as powerful momentum, while promoting culture exchanges and trade collaboration in the GBA.

  Mr Chan said, ""Hong Kong will maintain close co-operation with the GASC to further promote the joint development of the sports industry in the GBA and attract more major events to be held in Hong Kong and the GBA, thereby contributing to building a world-class bay area and the country's efforts to become a sporting powerhouse.""

  Officials attending today's press conference included Deputy Director of the GASC Mr Tong Lixin; Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG and Standing Committee member of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, Mr Wang Xi; Mr Chan; and Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG and Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture of the Macao Special Administrative Region Government, Ms O Lam."

Results of Primary One discretionary places to be released November 24,2025-11-21 11:30,2025-11-21 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100157.htm,"  The results of Primary One discretionary places for September 2026 will be released next Monday (November 24) by all government and aided primary schools.

  A spokesman for the Education Bureau (EDB) said today (November 21), ""There are 37581 children applying for discretionary places in government and aided primary schools this year, of whom 19656 will be offered a place in these schools. Among them, a total of 9477 children are applicants with sibling(s) studying or with parent(s) working in the schools that they have applied to, whereas the remaining 10179 are selected according to the Points System.""

  Parents who have already activated their POA e-platform (ePOA) account are reminded to check the results via the ePOA from 10am next Monday. Parents can also bring the parent's copy of the paper Application Form for Primary One Admission (POA) and check the results of their discretionary place application between 9am and 5pm on that day at the school to which they have applied.

  Parents whose children have been offered a discretionary place are advised to note carefully the registration arrangements of the schools concernedand the documents required for registration, such as the parent's copy of the paper Application Form for POA or the electronic application record in the ePOA, as well as the specified number of photographs of their children. They should register their children next Wednesday (November 26) or Thursday (November 27) at the school to which they have applied during school hours.

  ""Parents who cannot register for their child on the above dates should notify the person-in-charge of the school in advance to make alternative arrangements. Otherwise, they will be deemed to have given up their discretionary place,"" the spokesman said.

  Under the POA System, each government or aided primary school may make use of about 50 per cent of its total Primary One places as discretionary places. The remaining approximately 50 per cent of the total places will be reserved for Central Allocation at a later stage.

  ""Parents of applicant children who have failed to secure a discretionary place or who have opted for Central Allocation only will be informed by the EDB in writing in mid-January 2026 to make choices of schools for Central Allocation via ePOA from January 19 to 25 or at a designated Central Allocation Centre on January 24 or 25. We encourage parents to register with 'iAM Smart+' (www.iamsmart.gov.hk/en/reg.html) as early as possible and activate their ePOA account using 'iAM Smart+' for more convenient and faster electronic services.

  ""For applications for participation in POA 2026 made after January 25, parents are required to approach the School Places Allocation Section of the EDB to complete the necessary procedures. The EDB will separately arrange a Primary One place for the applicant children in June 2026,"" the spokesman said.

  ""Parents should note that once their children have been allocated a Primary One place, they cannot take part in the POA System again in the future,"" he added."

Professor Liu (Director General of the Bureau of International Cooperation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Professor Liu Weidong), Professor Boey (President and University Distinguished Professor of the City University of Hong Kong, Professor Freddy Boey), Professor Luo (Co-Chair of the International Summit of AI for Science 2025, Professor of the Hong Kong Institute of Science & Innovation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Professor Luo Jiebo), Professor Ma (Co-Chair of the International Summit of AI for Science 2025, Director of the Hong Kong Institute of AI for Science of the City University of Hong Kong, Professor Ma Weiying), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you all today at the International Summit of AI for Science 2025, cohosted by the Hong Kong Institute of Science and Innovation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the City University of Hong Kong.

  The theme of today - ""Empowering Breakthroughs at the Intersection of AI and Science"" - underscores the pivotal role of AI as a catalyst for innovation and technology (I&T) development. From life sciences to material sciences, AI is accelerating discovery. It is not merely a tool but a transformative force that reshapes the very paradigms of scientific research and technological revolution, as well as industry transformation. Today's summit is a collective exploration of how AI can define the boundaries of human knowledge.

  Hong Kong is proud to stand at the forefront of this transformation. The Hong Kong SAR Government has identified AI as a key industry for future growth and has set out clear goals for the development of AI. With a focus on ""strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach"", we introduce multidimensional policies to promote the development of AI in Hong Kong, in line with the national ""AI+"" initiative and consistent with the global development path of AI.

  Amongst others, InnoHK is a major government I&T initiative to foster global research collaboration. The InnoHK platform has successfully established collaborations with more than 30 world-renowned universities and research institutes. On the AI and robotics side, we have so far brought together a total of 16 R&D (research and development) centres and laboratories and over 1 700 leading research talents locally and globally to drive breakthroughs in robotics and enhance Hong Kong's AI capabilities. We are delighted that the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics established by the Hong Kong Institute of Science and Innovation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences also participated in this important initiative, with a focus on innovative integration of AI and life sciences. Besides, we are working on the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute in 2026, which will facilitate upstream AI R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes, as well as expansion of application scenarios.

  According to the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2025 by the International Institute for Management Development, Hong Kong ranked fourth globally, rising three spots from the previous year. The new ranking is based on improvements in ""technology"", ""knowledge"", and ""future readiness"", with the city achieving the top global spot in ""technological framework"" and ""adaptive attitudes"". This achievement reaffirms our progress in developing Hong Kong into a global digital hub.

  We are excited to learn that the International Summit of AI for Science is a platform that connects Hong Kong with top international research talent to promote global collaboration and exchange among scientists. Many brilliant minds from all over the world have come together today to share their expertise across various fields and exchange ideas on AI. In this connection, I congratulate the Hong Kong Institute of Science & Innovation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the City University of Hong Kong for organising this Summit.

  Last but not least, may I invite all voters to cast your votes in the upcoming Legislative Council election on December 7. This is important for Hong Kong. I wish today's event every success. Thank you."

​政務司司長在深圳出席第十五屆全國運動會總體運行情況新聞發布會開場發言（只有中文）,2025-11-21 11:05,2025-11-21 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100294.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十一月二十一日）在深圳出席第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）總體運行情況新聞發布會的開場發言：

各位媒體朋友：

大家好！第十五屆全國運動會將於今晚將舉行閉幕式，為歷史上首次由粵港澳三地攜手主辦的體育盛事劃上完美句號。

首先，我們衷心感謝中央對香港特區政府的高度信任，讓香港有機會以東道主身分，參與國家水平最高、規模最大的全國性大型綜合運動會。

粵港澳三地早在兩年多前便開始緊密聯繫和建立聯絡機制，全力推動十五運會的籌備工作。香港賽區成功舉辦了十五運會的八個競賽項目，包括沙灘排球、男子手球、男子22歲以下組籃球、七人制橄欖球、高爾夫球、場地自行車、鐵人三項和撃劍，以及一個群眾賽事活動保齡球，賽事在八月二十二日至十一月二十日期間舉行，共誕生39面競賽項目金牌和六面群眾賽事活動金牌。

十五運會期間，有超過1 600名運動員在香港賽區競賽，加上約1 000名代表團官員、500名技術官員和800多名傳媒代表註冊採訪，共約近4 000人參與香港賽區賽事。

我們在賽事組織、安保交通、接待住宿、宣傳票務等做了充分準備，並平穩有序地完成相關工作。我們特別注重賽風賽紀，運動員亦表現出良好的紀律和體育精神。各廣播機構和新聞媒體對十五運會的精彩賽事和相關宣傳活動進行廣泛報道，吸引大量市民親赴比賽場地或透過電視或網上觀賽，在全港形成熾熱的運動氣氛，多項精彩的賽事和運動員的優異表現都成為全城熱話。

作為東道主之一，香港市民可現場觀看國家最高水平運動員作賽，同時近距離感受運動員奮勇向上、自強不息的精神，這不單有助激發市民對體育運動的熱情，更有助加強市民對體育的關注，推動全民運動的文化，達致「全運惠民」的理念。

香港賽區的各個比賽場地附近都設有「比賽村」，讓市民嘗試和體驗不同的運動項目，希望他們藉着觀賽和參與，埋下「體育熱誠」的種子，即使在全運會（全國運動會）結束後，市民對體育運動依然充滿激情。

今屆全運會香港特區派出歷來規模最大的代表團參加，總人數達1 800人，其中包括602名運動員參與28項競賽項目，以及760名運動員參與23項群眾賽事活動。

香港運動員也不負眾望，在競賽項目中，共取得9金2銀8銅一共19面獎牌，創下了香港特區自回歸以來參加全運會的最佳成績。這除了是運動員、教練和專業支援團隊的努力外，也是特區政府近年持續增加投放資源，推動香港體育發展和支援運動員的成果。對於香港運動員的卓越表現，我們深感驕傲。他們能夠與全國精英在這個國家級的競技舞台上同場較量、交流學習，提升競技實力，實在獲益良多。市民在觀賽之餘，也加深對國家體育發展和全國頂尖運動員的認識，培養市民特別是年輕一代的愛國情懷和對國家和民族的自豪感。

體育強則中國強，國運興則體育興。國家正全力建設體育強國，透過體育提高人民健康水平，同時展示國家的軟實力。粵港澳大灣區首次聯合辦賽的成功經驗，不僅是一個重要里程碑，讓世界看到國家的實力，也是香港回歸祖國28周年，「一國兩制」成功實踐的有力證明。

今屆全運會是三地在體育協作的創新實踐，展現了粵港澳大灣區共同發展的無限可能。其中香港協辦的兩項跨境賽事——公路自行車男子個人賽和田徑馬拉松，向世界展示大灣區合辦大型賽事的條件和能力。粵港澳三地充分利用各自的獨特優勢，發揮1+1+1大於3的協同效應，是一次集三地所長的完美結合。

這次全運會的成功舉辦，不僅提升香港舉辦大型體育盛事的能力，更可推動大灣區城市的深度融合與協作，促進大灣區內的民心交流，為三地合作協辦大型盛事奠定堅實基礎，進一步提升大灣區的整體競爭力，共同為國家發展作出貢獻。謝謝大家。"
Mainland semiconductor materials technology start-up uses Hong Kong as headquarters to scale up operations (with photo),2025-11-21 11:05,2025-11-21 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112000468.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) announced today (November 21) that Dynano Semiconductor Technology Company Limited (Dynano Semiconductor) from the Mainland has officially established its foothold in Hong Kong as its headquarters. It aims to efficiently integrate the Chinese Mainland's manufacturing capacity, Hong Kong's international capital, and overseas cutting-edge technology, creating a synergistic model of ""research and development (R&D) in Hong Kong, pilot production in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), and access globe markets"".
  
  Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK Ms Loretta Lee welcomed Dynano Semiconductor's official establishment in Hong Kong. She said, ""By setting up its headquarters in Hong Kong, Dynano Semiconductor has taken a significant step in expanding their overseas operations. It also highlights Hong Kong's increasingly important role as an innovation and technology hub and international business centre. I wish them great success and hope they leverage Hong Kong to explore more overseas markets.""
  
  The Chief Technology Officer of Dynano Semiconductor, Professor Huang Mingxin, indicated that Dynano Semiconductor, as one of the first projects in the HKU Techno-Entrepreneurship Academy, has already laid a solid foundation in research. The start-up plans to leverage Hong Kong's geographic advantage to tap into European and Japanese markets, using the city as a ""transformation hub"" to commercialise its research results.

各位媒體朋友：

大家好！第十五屆全國運動會將於今晚將舉行閉幕式，為歷史上首次由粵港澳三地攜手主辦的體育盛事劃上完美句號。

首先，我們衷心感謝中央對香港特區政府的高度信任，讓香港有機會以東道主身分，參與國家水平最高、規模最大的全國性大型綜合運動會。

粵港澳三地早在兩年多前便開始緊密聯繫和建立聯絡機制，全力推動十五運會的籌備工作。香港賽區成功舉辦了十五運會的八個競賽項目，包括沙灘排球、男子手球、男子22歲以下組籃球、七人制橄欖球、高爾夫球、場地自行車、鐵人三項和撃劍，以及一個群眾賽事活動保齡球，賽事在八月二十二日至十一月二十日期間舉行，共誕生39面競賽項目金牌和六面群眾賽事活動金牌。

十五運會期間，有超過1 600名運動員在香港賽區競賽，加上約1 000名代表團官員、500名技術官員和800多名傳媒代表註冊採訪，共約近4 000人參與香港賽區賽事。

我們在賽事組織、安保交通、接待住宿、宣傳票務等做了充分準備，並平穩有序地完成相關工作。我們特別注重賽風賽紀，運動員亦表現出良好的紀律和體育精神。各廣播機構和新聞媒體對十五運會的精彩賽事和相關宣傳活動進行廣泛報道，吸引大量市民親赴比賽場地或透過電視或網上觀賽，在全港形成熾熱的運動氣氛，多項精彩的賽事和運動員的優異表現都成為全城熱話。

作為東道主之一，香港市民可現場觀看國家最高水平運動員作賽，同時近距離感受運動員奮勇向上、自強不息的精神，這不單有助激發市民對體育運動的熱情，更有助加強市民對體育的關注，推動全民運動的文化，達致「全運惠民」的理念。

香港賽區的各個比賽場地附近都設有「比賽村」，讓市民嘗試和體驗不同的運動項目，希望他們藉着觀賽和參與，埋下「體育熱誠」的種子，即使在全運會（全國運動會）結束後，市民對體育運動依然充滿激情。

今屆全運會香港特區派出歷來規模最大的代表團參加，總人數達1 800人，其中包括602名運動員參與28項競賽項目，以及760名運動員參與23項群眾賽事活動。

香港運動員也不負眾望，在競賽項目中，共取得9金2銀8銅一共19面獎牌，創下了香港特區自回歸以來參加全運會的最佳成績。這除了是運動員、教練和專業支援團隊的努力外，也是特區政府近年持續增加投放資源，推動香港體育發展和支援運動員的成果。對於香港運動員的卓越表現，我們深感驕傲。他們能夠與全國精英在這個國家級的競技舞台上同場較量、交流學習，提升競技實力，實在獲益良多。市民在觀賽之餘，也加深對國家體育發展和全國頂尖運動員的認識，培養市民特別是年輕一代的愛國情懷和對國家和民族的自豪感。

體育強則中國強，國運興則體育興。國家正全力建設體育強國，透過體育提高人民健康水平，同時展示國家的軟實力。粵港澳大灣區首次聯合辦賽的成功經驗，不僅是一個重要里程碑，讓世界看到國家的實力，也是香港回歸祖國28周年，「一國兩制」成功實踐的有力證明。

今屆全運會是三地在體育協作的創新實踐，展現了粵港澳大灣區共同發展的無限可能。其中香港協辦的兩項跨境賽事——公路自行車男子個人賽和田徑馬拉松，向世界展示大灣區合辦大型賽事的條件和能力。粵港澳三地充分利用各自的獨特優勢，發揮1+1+1大於3的協同效應，是一次集三地所長的完美結合。

Two registered specialist contractors disciplined for offences relating to building works,2025-11-21 11:00,2025-11-21 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112100207.htm,"âThe Registered Contractors' Disciplinary Board (the Board) has completed disciplinary inquiries under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) on two fatal site incidents and decided that the two Registered Specialist Contractors (RSC) concerned should be disciplined for having been convicted by a court of offences relating to building works.

The Board's written decisions and orders issued on November 10 were published in the Gazette today (November 21). Details are available at the following links:

Case 1: egazette.gld.gov.hk/pdf?type=egn&year=2025&volume=29&gno=47&notice_no=7299&extra=0
Case 2: egazette.gld.gov.hk/pdf?type=egn&year=2025&volume=29&gno=47&notice_no=7298&extra=0

The first case involved a fatal incident that occurred on October 19, 2021, at a construction site for foundation works in Shap Sze Heung, New Territories. While a team of workers was carrying out wire rope replacement work of a crawler-mounted crane, one of them was hit by a swinging wire rope and passed away later that day. The RSC was prosecuted by the Labour Department (LD) for violation of the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations (CSSR) and the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Safety Management) Regulation. The RSC was convicted and fined $37,000 at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts on June 24, 2022. In view of the convictions of the RSC, the Buildings Department (BD) notified the Board for its consideration of disciplinary action against the RSC under the provisions of section 13(1) of the BO.

Upon completion of the disciplinary inquiry, the Board ordered the RSC to be fined $220,000 and to pay a total of $50,300 being the costs of the Board and the BD for conducting the inquiry.

The second case involved a fatal incident that occurred on March 23, 2020, at a slope maintenance site in Yau Yat Chuen, Kowloon Tong. A worker, while carrying out slope maintenance work, fell from a height of about 3 metres from the top of a retaining wall to the ground. He sustained a serious head injury and passed away on the same day. The RSC was prosecuted by the LD for violation of the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance and the CSSR. The RSC was convicted and fined $42,000 at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts on December 21, 2020. In view of the convictions of the RSC, the BD notified the Board for its consideration of disciplinary action against the RSC under the provisions of section 13(1) of the BO.

Upon completion of the disciplinary inquiry, the Board ordered the RSC to be fined $124,000 and to pay a total of $58,500 being the costs of the Board and the BD for conducting the inquiry.

A spokesperson for the BD reiterated that any registered contractor who contravenes the relevant provisions of the BO in carrying out building works, or is convicted by any court of an offence relating to building works, or has been negligent or has misconducted themselves in building works, will be subject to enforcement action including criminal prosecution and disciplinary action under the BO."
Government sells Tsing Yi site for purpose of electric vehicle fast charging station,2025-11-21 11:00,2025-11-21 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/21/P2025112000242.htm,"The Government announced today (November 21) the sale of Tsing Yi Town Lot No. 203 at No. 183 Tsing Yi Road West, Tsing Yi, New Territories, for conversion to a fast charging station (FCS) for electric vehicles (EVs) through public tendering. The tender invitation will close on January 30, 2026.

A spokesperson for the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) said, ""To promote the green transformation of vehicles and to achieve zero vehicular emissions and carbon neutrality before 2050, the Government announced that there would be no new registration of fuel-propelled private cars (including hybrid vehicles) in 2035 or earlier. To cope with the rapid demand for charging facilities with the increase of EVs, the Government has expedited the expansion of the charging network for different types of EVs (including commercial EVs). The Government also sold through open tender three petrol filling station (PFS) sites in Kowloon Bay, Fo Tan and Tai Po for FCS purposes. The Government will, subject to actual market needs, select suitable PFS sites for conversion into FCSs in a timely manner. In addition, the area for retail use in the site of this sale is larger than that of a conventional PFS, allowing operators more flexibility to use such area to meet the needs of EV drivers.""

Tsing Yi Town Lot No. 203 has a site area of 1 973.9 square metres and is designated for EV FCS purposes. Land sale documents, including the forms of tender, tender notice, conditions of sale and sale plan of the lot, are now available on the Lands Department (LandsD) website (www.landsd.gov.hk) for downloading. The sale plan is available for inspection by the public from today until the close of the tender.

  The Council on Human Reproductive Technology (Council) today (November 21) issued a notice in the Gazette notifying the publication of the amended Code of Practice on Reproductive Technology and Embryo Research (Code), requiring licensed centres to provide those storing their gametes or embryos for own use with additional counselling services.

  The Human Reproductive Technology (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 (Amendment Regulation) will come into effect on December 1, removing the statutory storage periods of gametes and embryos for own use under the Human Reproductive Technology (Licensing) Regulation (Cap. 561A) to enable members of the public to make their own decisions on the storage duration of their gametes or embryos depending on their health and other conditions, with a view to better realising reproductive autonomy.

  In connection with the Amendment Regulation, the Council amended the Code, requiring persons who have stored their gametes or embryos for their own use for five years or more to receive additional counselling services before storage can be extended. During counselling, licensed centres are required to provide information regarding the medical risks associated with the relevant procedures and risks of pregnancy at an advanced maternal age, etc. There will be a one-year grace period for the relevant arrangements, whereby persons concerned only need to complete the counselling services and procedures of extension of storage within one year after the commencement of the amended Code, or before their first storage extension, whichever is later. The amended Code would come into effect on the same day (December 1) as the Amendment Regulation.

  The amended Code is available on the website of the Council (www.chrt.org.hk)."

CFS instructs trade to suspend import of ByHeart powdered infant formula with possible contamination of Clostridium botulinum,2025-11-20 22:37,2025-11-20 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000833.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (November 20) said that, in view of the latest announcement by the manufacturer of ByHeart powdered infant formula yesterday (November 19) that Clostridium botulinum was found in unopened cans of ByHeart powdered infant formula, while no affected products were available for sale in Hong Kong, the CFS has immediately implemented precautionary measures and instructed the trade to suspend import of the relevant ByHeart powdered infant formula.

The CFS, through its Food Incident Surveillance System, noted notices issued by the Food and Drug Administration of the United State (US) earlier that ByHeart powdered infant formula is being voluntarily recalled due to possible contamination with Clostridium botulinum. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed up with major local importers and retailers. Investigation found that the affected products had not been put on sale in Hong Kong. Earlier the CFS has also published food incident post to remind the public and the trade.

Product details of the affected powdered infant formula are as follows:

Product names:
(1) ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans
(2) ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula Anywhere Pack™
Brand: ByHeart
Place of origin: US
Batch: All batches and packages

The spokesman said, ""Although the US manufacturer concerned has initiated a recall of the affected products, for the sake of prudence, the CFS urges travellers to immediately stop consuming the affected products if they have bought any of them.""

Infant botulism is caused by the ingestion of the Clostridium botulinum spores that germinate and grow in the intestine of infants and release toxin. A very small amount of toxin can cause illness. The onset of symptoms generally follows a period of normal development. Early symptom is constipation, followed by poor feeding, lethargy, weakness, pooled oral secretions, and wail or altered cry. Loss of head control is striking. Infant botulism ranges from mild illness with gradual onset to sudden infant death. While most cases require hospitalisation, fatal cases are rare (case fatality rate less than 1 per cent).

""The CFS has contacted the US authorities over the incident and will continue to closely monitor information issued by the relevant authorities and take appropriate action. Follow-up work is ongoing,"" the spokesman said."

食安中心指示業界暫停進口疑受肉毒桿菌污染的ByHeart嬰兒配方奶粉,2025-11-20 21:38,2025-11-20 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000800.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（十一月二十日）表示，鑑於ByHeart嬰兒配方奶粉的製造商昨日（十一月十九日）發布的最新公告，指在未開封的ByHeart嬰兒配方奶粉中檢出肉毒桿菌，雖然受影響產品沒有在本港出售，中心已即時實施預防措施，指示業界暫停進口相關ByHeart嬰兒配方奶粉。

中心早前透過食物事故監測系統，得悉美國食品藥物管理局發出通告，指ByHeart嬰兒配方奶粉可能受肉毒桿菌污染而進行自願回收。中心得悉事件後，已即時聯絡本地主要進口商和零售商跟進。調查顯示受影響產品沒有在本港出售，中心早前亦已發布食物事故報表，提醒公眾和業界。

受影響嬰兒配方奶粉的產品資料如下：

產品名稱：
（一）ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans
（二）ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula Anywhere Pack™
品牌：ByHeart
原產地：美國
批次：所有批次及包裝

發言人說：「雖然有關的美國製造商已在當地回收受影響產品，但為審慎起見，中心呼籲外遊的市民如曾購入有關產品，應立即停止食用。」

嬰兒肉毒中毒是由嬰兒攝入肉毒桿菌孢子所致，這些孢子在其腸道內發芽和生長，繼而釋出毒素致病。極微量的毒素已足以引致肉毒中毒。嬰兒發病前身體仍有一段時間發育正常，至病徵出現時早期是便秘，繼而出現餵哺困難、無精打彩、虛弱無力、口腔分泌物增多，以及哭聲微弱，最明顯的是無法控制頭部。嬰兒肉毒中毒起初可能病情輕微，但隨着病情進展，可致猝死。雖然大部分患者均需接受住院治療，但致命的情況較罕見（死亡率不足百分之一）。

發言人說：「中心已就事件聯絡美國當局，並會繼續密切留意有關當局發出的相關消息及採取適當跟進行動。跟進工作仍然繼續。」"

最新個案資料
——————
個案涉及一名63歲男子，住所位於葵青區。初步調查顯示，他於十月二十九日到訪廣東省深圳市。他於十一月中旬出現發燒，並於昨日（十一月十九日）出現關節痛及皮疹，同日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

病人的一名家居接觸者曾與他一同到深圳市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於個案在病發前約兩星期曾前往受基孔肯雅熱影響的地方旅遊，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————
本港今年累計錄得65宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-20 20:47,2025-11-20 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/20/P2025112000720.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 20),the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
------------------------------
 The case involves a 63-year-old male living in Kwai Tsing District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Shenzhen in Guangdong on October 29. He developed a fever in mid-November, and presented with joint pain and rash yesterday (November 19). He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital on the same day, and admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

 The patient has one household contact, who travelled with him to Shenzhen. She is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 As the patient has visited CF-affected areas for travel about two weeks before the onset, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 65 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

In light of the local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of the patient's residence to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 950 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past five days. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus. The operating hours of the booth will be adjusted based on actual needs. Please refer to the CHP'swebpagefor the actual operating hours of the health consultation booth.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
