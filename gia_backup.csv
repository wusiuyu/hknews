行政長官讚揚中國香港運動員在殘特奧會表現卓越,2025-12-15 17:18,2025-12-15 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500581.htm,"全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）今日（十二月十五日）閉幕。行政長官李家超讚揚中國香港運動員在殘特奧會表現卓越，展現非凡鬥志和優秀體育風範，祝賀他們獲得佳績。

李家超說：「中國香港代表團以歷來最大規模參加今屆殘特奧會，他們充分發揮個人毅力和團隊精神，創出歷史佳績，在跆拳道、田徑、乒乓球、游泳、硬地滾球、輪椅擊劍、羽毛球、特奧田徑、特奧滾球、特奧游泳、特奧籃球、特奧足球、特奧乒乓球、特奧羽毛球，以及大眾項目輪椅舞蹈賽事中，取得51金49銀40銅共140面獎牌，成績令人鼓舞。運動員奮力拼搏、克服障礙、超越自我，展現香港永不言敗、堅毅不屈的精神。」

「殘特奧會是國家最高水平的綜合殘疾人士體育盛會，今屆由粵港澳三地首次聯合承辦，當中香港承辦四個競賽項目和一個大眾項目，我感謝中央的信任、中國殘疾人聯合會和國家體育總局的支持。憑藉第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）的寶貴經驗，粵港澳三地繼續發揮資源共享、優勢互補的協同效應，同心合力完成傳遞平等、融合、共享的殘特奧會。」

「我感謝社會各界對殘特奧會的支持，尤其香港體育學院（體院）、中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會、中國香港殘疾人奧委會、各相關體育總會和體育機構的教練團隊、醫療人員和支援團隊的努力和付出，協助香港運動員盡展所長，讓香港賽區項目順行舉行，推動傷健共融，加強社會對殘疾運動的支持。」

李家超表示，特區政府不遺餘力推動殘疾體育發展。在二○二四至二五年度，政府在殘疾人士體育發展的實際開支超過1.4億元，支援殘疾運動員的開支佔殘疾體育發展整體開支八成以上；在二○二五年至二六年度，政府對體院的撥款預算超過10億元，用以支援體院培訓精英運動員，包括殘疾人精英運動項目。政府通過持續增加資源、優化培訓階梯，鼓勵更多殘疾人士投身運動員行列、發揮所長，提升大眾對殘疾運動的認識和支持。

李家超說，十五運會和殘特奧會圓滿舉行，展現香港和粵港澳大灣區舉辦大型體育盛事的能力。特區政府已與國家體育總局、廣東省人民政府、澳門特區政府簽署了《關於加強體育合作、促進融合發展的協議》，會在有關戰略框架下，延續團結精神，進一步推動粵港澳大灣區深化合作，積極落實大灣區體育融合發展。"
"CE commends Hong Kong, China athletes for outstanding performance in 12th NGD and 9th NSOG",2025-12-15 17:18,2025-12-15 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500585.htm,"ããThe 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG) conclude today (December 15). The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, commended Hong Kong, China athletes for their outstanding performance in the Games, showcasing remarkable determination and excellent sportsmanship, and extended his congratulations on their achievements.

 Mr Lee said, ""The Hong Kong, China Delegation participating in the 12th NGD and 9th NSOG was the largest ever. The athletes fully demonstrated personal perseverance and team spirit, achieving historic and encouraging results with a total of 140 medals, including 51 gold, 49 silver, and 40 bronze medals in taekwondo, athletics, table tennis, swimming, boccia, wheelchair fencing, badminton, NSOG athletics, NSOG bocce, NSOG swimming, NSOG basketball, NSOG football, NSOG table tennis and NSOG badminton, and a mass participation event of para dance sport. They strove hard, overcame obstacles, and surpassed their personal bests, showcasing Hong Kong's indefatigable and indomitable spirit.

 ""The 12th NGD and 9th NSOG are the country's highest-level multisport event for persons with disabilities. Noting that this year's Games were jointly hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao for the first time with Hong Kong hosting four competition events and one mass participation event, I express my gratitude to the Central Government for its trust, and to the China Disabled Persons' Federation and the General Administration of Sport of China (GASC) for their support. Building on the valuable experience of the 15th National Games, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao continue to leverage their synergies through resource sharing and complementary strengths to work in concert to deliver the 12th NGD and 9th NSOG under the principle of equality, integration and sharing.

 ""I would like to thank all sectors of society for their support for the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG, especially the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, and the China Hong Kong Paralympic Committee, as well as the coaching teams, medical personnel, and support teams from relevant National Sports Associations and sports organisations. Their efforts and contributions have assisted Hong Kong athletes in showcasing their talents and enabled the smooth running of events in the Hong Kong competition region, promoting harmony between disabled and non-disabled individuals and enhancing society's support for disability sports.""

 Mr Lee said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government is fully committed to promoting the development of disability sports, noting that the Government's actual expenditure on sports development for persons with disabilities exceeded $140 million in the year of 2024-25, with over 80 per cent of the expenditure supporting athletes with disabilities. The Government has designated over $1 billion for the HKSI in the year of 2025-26 to support its training for elite athletes, including those for elite disability sports. The Government will encourage more persons with disabilities to pursue careers as athletes and showcase their talents through continuously increasing resources and enhancing the athlete training ladder, with a view to raising the public's awareness of and support for disability sports.

 Mr Lee remarked that the successful conclusion of the 15th National Games, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG demonstrated the capabilities of Hong Kong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in organising large-scale sports events. The Hong Kong SAR Government, the GASC, the People's Government of Guangdong Province, and the Macao SAR Government have signed an agreement on strengthening of sports co-operation and promotion of integrated development to carry forward the spirit of unity under the strategic framework, with a view to deepening co-operation within the GBA and actively implementing integrated sports development in the area."
FEHD summarises efforts to combat dripping air conditioners this year,2025-12-15 17:04,2025-12-15 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500611.htm,"  A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (December 15) that the department has been adopting a multipronged approach to tackle dripping air conditioner issues. The FEHD stepped up inspections and enforcement across districts in Hong Kong this summer. By combining publicity and education, the application of innovative technology and adjustments to operational strategies, the measures have achieved notable results.

  The spokesman said, ""As of November 30, the FEHD had handled accumulatively about 8 500 dripping air conditioners this year, a number that had risen by approximately three times compared to 2023, and recorded an increase of more than 30 per cent compared with the same period last year. The problem of dripping air conditioners has shown considerable improvement at locations identified as black spots.

  ""Given the vast number of air conditioners across Hong Kong, dripping air conditioners remain common and pose considerable challenges to the department's enforcement efforts. The FEHD will build on this year's experience to formulate more effective strategies and measures. These include the additional use of AI image recognition technology to automatically detect dripping sources, as well as strengthening collaboration with the property management sector to tackle the problem of dripping air conditioners and improve the living environment for the public,"" the spokesman added.

  The FEHD adopted a new operational strategy this year. In addition to sustaining the effort in handling public complaints, FEHD officers proactively conducted door-to-door inspections and took enforcement action at about 300 key follow-up locations with dripping air conditioners across districts. Thirty dripping blackspots causing significant nuisance to the public, including bus stops, minibus stops and pedestrian passages, were also targeted, with enforcement actions conducted at least once a week. To address the prevalence of dripping issues during night-time and early morning hours, the department reallocated manpower for investigations, shifting from the previous 70 per cent daytime and 30 per cent night-time distribution to 30 per cent daytime and 70 per cent night-time.

  By leveraging innovative technology, the FEHD also collaborated with the Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre under the Innovation and Technology Commission to develop the Dripping Air Conditioner Investigation System, which has achieved remarkable results while being used in all districts. Equipped with infrared night-vision recording, the system can quickly identify the source of dripping at night or in low-light conditions. With a detection range of up to 120 meters, it can cover buildings of around 40 stories high, significantly reducing the time required for investigation and evidence collection. Building on the existing Dripping Air Conditioner Investigation System, the FEHD plans to develop AI recognition technology to automatically detect dripping locations and accurately pinpoint sources, thereby significantly improving investigation accuracy and enhancing the work efficiency. The department aims to begin implementing the new technology in the summer next year.

  The FEHD also strengthened publicity and education in collaboration with District Council members, members of the local community and property management companies. Leaflets and posters were distributed, promotional materials were displayed at bus stops, and feature videos were released through social media, radio and television, reminding the public to check their air conditioners regularly and promptly address any dripping issues to avoid creating a nuisance.

  In addition, the FEHD recently collaborated with the Property Management Services Authority to develop the Best Practice Guide on Handling Dripping Air Conditioners, providing guidance for licensed property management companies and property management personnel. In parallel, the FEHD continues to promote the Scheme of Participation by Property Management Agents in Tackling Dripping Air-conditioners, inviting property management agents of private housing estates to assist in handling related complaints. Currently, about 290 private housing estates participate in the Scheme, handling an average of over 4 000 cases annually.

  The FEHD calls on all sectors to work together. Property management companies should repair and maintain building drainage systems regularly and remind residents to check and repair their air conditioners. Members of the public should check and maintain their air conditioners regularly and take immediate action if water dripping happens in order to prevent causing a nuisance. For more information, please refer to the leaflet on the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/library/aircon/Pamphlet_water_dripping_from_air_conditioner.pdf)."
食環署總結今年打擊冷氣機滴水工作,2025-12-15 17:04,2025-12-15 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500614.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（十二月十五日）表示，署方持續以多管齊下方式打擊冷氣機滴水問題，今年夏季在全港各區加強巡查及執管，並結合宣傳教育、創新科技應用及行動策略調整，取得一定成效。

發言人說:「截至十一月三十日，食環署今年累計已處理約8 500部冷氣機的滴水問題，較二○二三年多出約三倍，與去年同期比較亦增加超過三成。當中，在署方鎖定的黑點，冷氣機滴水問題有顯著改善。」

發言人續指：「全港冷氣機數目龐大，滴水情況相當普遍，署方的打擊工作面對一定挑戰。署方會總結今年經驗，制訂更有效的策略和措施，包括進一步利用人工智能影像識別技術自動偵測滴水位置，和加強與物業管理業合作，致力打擊冷氣機滴水問題，改善市民生活環境。」

食環署今年採取全新行動策略，除繼續處理市民投訴外，署方人員主動出擊，以「洗樓」形式重點跟進各區約300個冷氣機滴水地點，亦鎖定30個對市民造成較大滋擾的黑點，包括巴士站、小巴站及行人通道等，展開每星期最少一次的執法行動。因應滴水問題多在夜間及清晨出現，署方亦調整調查人手分配，由以往日間七成、夜間三成，改為日間三成、夜間七成。

食環署亦積極應用創新科技，與創新科技署轄下物流及供應鏈多元技術研發中心合作研發冷氣機滴水調查系統，今年在各區應用成效顯著。該系統配備紅外線夜視錄像功能，能在夜間或低光環境下快速鎖定滴水源頭，偵測範圍達120米，足以覆蓋約40層高的大廈，大幅縮短調查取證時間。食環署計劃在現有冷氣機滴水調查系統的基礎上，開發人工智能影像識別技術，自動偵測滴水位置，精準定位源頭，以大幅提升調查準確性，並提高工作效率，期望於明年夏季開始應用。

食環署亦與各界協作加強宣傳教育，包括與區議員、地區人士及物業管理公司派發宣傳單張和海報、在巴士站張貼宣傳海報，並透過社交媒體、電台及電視台等發布專題短片，呼籲市民定期檢查冷氣機，及早處理滴水問題，以免造成滋擾。

此外，食環署與物業管理業監管局共同制定「處理冷氣機滴水問題」良好作業指南，為持牌物業管理公司及物業管理人員提供相關指引。署方亦持續推廣物業管理公司協助處理冷氣機滴水事故計劃，邀請私人屋苑的物管公司協助處理相關投訴，目前已有290多個私人屋苑參與，平均每年處理逾4 000宗個案。

食環署呼籲各界攜手合作，物業管理公司應定期維修及保養大廈排水系統，並提醒住戶進行檢查維修。市民應定期檢查及保養冷氣機，並在出現滴水情況時立即處理，避免造成滋擾。更多資訊可參閱食環署網頁上的小冊子（www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/library/aircon/Pamphlet_water_dripping_from_air_conditioner.pdf）。"

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-12-15 16:45,2025-12-15 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500608.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (December 15) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From December 7 to 13, the CHP recorded one imported LD case, involving a 72-year-old male patient who had underlying illnesses.He travelled to the Chinese Mainland during the incubation period.

âThe CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that it is a sporadic case. No epidemiological linkages have been established between this case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of December 13, 157 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpool spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or ships.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, water fountains, humidifiers and home respiratory devices that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

â
âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) or less and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

 The late Senior Fireman, Mr Ho Wai-ho, was born in 1987. He joined the FSD as a fireman in 2016, with his meritorious service being recognised.

 Throughout his nine years of service with the FSD, Senior Fireman Ho fully demonstrated himself as an industrious, polite and dedicated member who was eager to provide guidance to newcomers. He was well-respected by his colleagues. His solid professional competence, high efficiency and sound judgement were amply displayed in a number of firefighting and rescue operations.

  While responding to a firefighting and rescue operation at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po on November 26, 2025, Mr Ho sustained serious injuries and sadly lost his life in the line of duty. The fire was later upgraded to a No. 5 alarm fire. His tragic death is a great loss not only to the FSD, but also to the community at large. Being courageous, selfless and dedicated, he will no doubt stay in the minds of Hong Kong people forever. In recognition of his fearless dedication in confronting the fire, the FSD has conferred the honorary title of Senior Fireman (Posthumous) on the late Mr Ho.

  Aged 37, Senior Fireman Ho is survived by his parents, an elder brother, a younger brother, and his fiancée."
Volume and price statistics of external merchandise trade in October 2025,2025-12-15 16:30,2025-12-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500407.htm,"  Further to the external merchandise trade statistics in value terms for October 2025 released earlier on, the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (December 15) the volume and price statistics of external merchandise trade for that month.

  In October 2025, the volume of Hong Kong's total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 14.6% and 15.7% respectively over October 2024.

  Comparing the first ten months of 2025 with the same period in 2024, the volume of Hong Kong's total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 11.6% and 11.3% respectively.

  Comparing the three-month period ending October 2025 with the preceding three months on a seasonally adjusted basis, the volume of total exports of goods and imports of goods decreased by 2.1% and 2.3% respectively.

  Changes in volume of external merchandise trade are derived from changes in external merchandise trade value with the effect of price changes discounted.

  Comparing October 2025 with October 2024, the prices of total exports of goods and imports of goods increased by 2.4% and 2.3% respectively.

  As regards price changes in the first ten months of 2025 over the same period in 2024, the prices of total exports of goods and imports of goods both increased by 2.0%.

  Price changes in external merchandise trade are reflected by changes in unit value indices of external merchandise trade, which are compiled based on average unit values or, for certain commodities, specific price data.

  The terms of trade index is derived from the ratio of price index of total exports of goods to that of imports of goods. Compared with the same periods in 2024, the index increased by 0.2% in October 2025, whereas it remained virtually unchanged in the first ten months of 2025.

  Changes in the unit value and volume of total exports of goods by main destination are shown in Table 1.

  Comparing October 2025 with October 2024, increases were recorded for the total export volume to all main destinations: Vietnam (52.6%), Taiwan (43.0%), the USA (39.1%), India (21.8%) and Chinese Mainland (the Mainland) (7.3%).

  Over the same period of comparison, the total export prices to all main destinations increased: Taiwan (4.7%), India (3.7%), the Mainland (2.5%), Vietnam (1.3%) and the USA (0.8%).

  Changes in the unit value and volume of imports of goods by main supplier are shown in Table 2.

  Comparing October 2025 with October 2024, increases were recorded for the import volume from all main suppliers: Vietnam (175.6%), the Mainland (18.2%), Singapore (13.9%), Japan (3.4%) and Taiwan (1.8%).

  Over the same period of comparison, the import prices from all main suppliers increased: Singapore (6.2%), Taiwan (5.6%), Vietnam (2.3%), Japan (1.3%) and the Mainland (0.4%).

Provisional statistics on index of industrial production and producer price index for manufacturing and waste management sectors for third quarter of 2025,2025-12-15 16:30,2025-12-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500525.htm,"  According to the provisional results of a survey released today (December 15) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the index of industrial production for manufacturing industries as a whole increased by 5.4% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with a year earlier, following a year-on-year increase of 0.9% in the second quarter of 2025. The corresponding producer price index increased by 7.7% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with a year earlier, following a year-on-year increase of 4.0% in the second quarter of 2025.

  The index of industrial production for sewerage, waste management and remediation activities decreased by 1.4% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with a year earlier, as against a year-on-year increase of 1.7% in the second quarter of 2025. The corresponding producer price index slightly increased by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with a year earlier, following a year-on-year increase of 1.6% in the second quarter of 2025.

  Indices of industrial production reflect changes in the volume of local industrial output after discounting the effect of price changes. The price changes are measured by the producer price indices compiled from data on producer prices of selected industrial goods/services collected in the same survey.

  Comparing the industrial production in respect of major manufacturing industries in the third quarter of 2025 with that a year earlier, increases in output volume were recorded mainly in the metal, computer, electronic and optical products, machinery and equipment industry (+6.1%), the food, beverages and tobacco industry (+2.5%), and the paper products, printing and reproduction of recorded media industry (+1.0%). On the other hand, a decrease in output volume was recorded in the textiles and wearing apparel industry (-5.2%).

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the index of industrial production for manufacturing industries as a whole increased by 4.6% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the second quarter of 2025.

  Producer price indices reflect changes in the prices of local output. They measure changes in the actual prices (net of any discounts or rebates allowed to buyers, plus any surcharges) received by producers for their output. Transportation and other incidental charges are not included.

  Comparing the third quarter of 2025 with a year earlier, increases in producer prices were recorded for all major manufacturing industries. The metal, computer, electronic and optical products, machinery and equipment industry had the largest increase in producer price (+14.6%), followed by the textiles and wearing apparel industry (+2.7%), the paper products, printing and reproduction of recorded media industry (+1.5%), and the food, beverages and tobacco industry (+1.0%).

  Table 1 shows the year-on-year percentage changes in the indices of industrial production for manufacturing and waste management sectors by selected industry grouping. Table 2 shows the year-on-year percentage changes in the producer price indices for manufacturing and waste management sectors by selected industry grouping.

Hong Kong's Gross National Income and external primary income flows for the third quarter of 2025,2025-12-15 16:30,2025-12-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500501.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (December 15) the preliminary statistics on Hong Kong's Gross National Income (GNI) and related figures for the third quarter of 2025.

  Hong Kong's GNI, which denotes the total income earned by Hong Kong residents from engaging in various economic activities, increased by 1.5% in the third quarter of 2025 over a year earlier to $908.2 billion at current market prices. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), estimated at $853.7 billion at current market prices in the same quarter, recorded a 4.8% increase over a year earlier. The value of GNI was larger than GDP by $54.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, which was equivalent to 6.4% of GDP in that quarter, mainly attributable to a net inflow of investment income.

  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, Hong Kong’s GNI increased by 0.2% in real terms in the third quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. The corresponding GDP in the same quarter increased by 3.8% in real terms.

  Hong Kong's total inflow of primary income, which mainly comprises investment income, estimated at $576.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025 and equivalent to 67.5% of GDP in that quarter, recorded a decrease of 7.4% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, total primary income outflow, estimated at $521.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025 and equivalent to 61.1% of GDP in that quarter, also decreased by 3.8% from a year earlier.

  As for the major components of investment income inflow, direct investment income (DII) decreased by 4.9% from a year earlier, mainly due to the decrease in earnings of some prominent local enterprises from their direct investment abroad. Portfolio investment income (PII) recorded a significant decrease of 10.6% from a year earlier, mainly attributable to the decrease in dividend income received by resident investors from their holdings of non-resident equity securities.

  Regarding the major components of investment income outflow, DII decreased by 4.1% from a year earlier, mainly due to the decrease in earnings of some prominent multinational enterprises from their direct investment in Hong Kong. PII increased by 7.6%, mainly attributable to the increase in interest payout to non-resident investors from their holdings of resident debt securities and the increase in dividend payout to non-resident investors from their holdings of resident equity securities.

  Analysed by country/territory, the Chinese Mainland continued to be the largest source of Hong Kong's total primary income inflow in the third quarter of 2025, accounting for 40.7%. This was followed by the British Virgin Islands (BVI), with a share of 16.0%. Regarding total primary income outflow, theChinese Mainland and the BVI remained the most important destinations in the third quarter of 2025, accounting for 36.0% and 18.4% respectively.

Further Information

  GDP and GNI are closely related indicators for measuring economic performance. GDP is a measure of the total value of production of all resident producing units of an economy. GNI denotes the total income earned by residents of an economy from engaging in various economic activities, irrespective of whether the economic activities are carried out within the economic territory of the economy or outside.

  Figures of GNI and primary income flows analysed by income component from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2025 are presented in Table A, while selected major country/territory breakdowns of primary income inflow and outflow for the same quarters are presented in Tables B(1) and B(2) respectively.

  Statistics on GDP and GNI from 2023 onwards and primary income flows for 2025 are subject to revision when more data are incorporated. In the light of the latest information available, annual and quarterly figures of GNI and external primary income flows for 2024 have been revised, such that the corresponding figures presented in Tables A and B are revised figures.

扣除其間價格變動的影響後，二零二五年第三季的香港本地居民總收入較上年同期實質上升0.2%，而本地生產總值在同季實質上升3.8%。

二零二五年第三季的香港初次收入（主要包括投資收益）總流入為5,761億元，較上年同期下跌7.4%，相當於該季本地生產總值的67.5%。與此同時，二零二五年第三季的初次收入總流出亦較上年同期下跌3.8%至5,215億元，相當於該季本地生產總值的61.1%。

就投資收益流入的主要組成部分而言，直接投資收益較上年同期下跌4.9%，主要是因為部分本地大型企業在外地的直接投資收益減少。證券投資收益較上年同期錄得10.6%的顯著跌幅，主要是由於本地投資者獲取的非本地股權證券的股息收益減少。

就投資收益流出的主要組成部分而言，直接投資收益較上年同期下跌4.1%，主要是由於部分大型跨國企業在本地的直接投資收益減少。證券投資收益上升7.6%，主要是由於非本地投資者獲取的本地債務證券的利息收益增加及非本地投資者獲取的本地股權證券的股息收益增加。

按國家／地區分析，二零二五年第三季，中國內地繼續是香港初次收入總流入的最主要來源地，佔當季總流入的40.7%。其次是英屬維爾京群島，佔16.0%。在初次收入總流出方面，中國內地及英屬維爾京群島在二零二五年第三季繼續是最主要目的地，分別佔當季總流出的36.0%及18.4%。

Amid a perilous environment, the baby elephant not only needs to learn to skilfully control its trunk but also to master the survival techniques passed down through generations to withstand threats from predators and relentless sandstorms.

The Namib Desert in Africa is the oldest desert on Earth, with extremely arid landscapes. A remarkable herd of desert elephants demonstrates extraordinary survival skills. Led by the experienced matriarch, these elephants forge powerful mother-daughter bonds that last a lifetime, with mothers nursing their young for up to seven years. ""Little Foot"" must master her trunk, a combination of nose and upper lip with over 150 000 muscle bundles, while learning unique desert adaptations like taking sand baths that serve as natural sunscreen and parasite protection. As hidden dangers lurk across the desert wilderness, the baby elephant must stay close to the herd to avoid being left alone and becoming prey to predators such as lions. She also needs to develop life-saving skills from her mother - sensing subtle ground vibrations to detect approaching sandstorms and finding hidden water sources beneath the desert - wisdom that determines survival in this unforgiving land.

The screening times of this 40-minute show are 5pm on weekdays, and 11am, 3.30pm and 8pm on weekends and public holidays.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 12 to noon today (December 15), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 403 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

衞生署醫院牙科服務整合至醫院管理局,2025-12-15 15:00,2025-12-15 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500276.htm,"衞生署和醫院管理局（醫管局）今日（十二月十五日）公布，衞生署轄下醫院牙科服務將於二○二六年二月六日與醫管局轄下口腔頜面外科服務合併，並由醫管局接辦。

行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》中提出全面審視醫療體系的定位和目標，改革醫管局、衞生署和基層醫療署的職能和分工。衞生署將專注其公共衞生職能，履行其監管和執法角色。為落實有關政策方向，衞生署的臨床服務正逐步整合至醫管局或基層醫療署。

繼早前醫管局接辦衞生署轄下醫學遺傳服務，該署醫院牙科服務將於明年二月六日起交由醫管局管理。事實上，現時衞生署醫院牙科服務轄下七間口腔頜面外科及牙科診所均位於以下醫管局公立醫院，主要為住院病人、有特殊口腔護理需要的患者及牙科急症患者提供口腔頜面外科專科及牙科專科診治：


瑪麗醫院；
東區尤德夫人那打素醫院；
伊利沙伯醫院；
瑪嘉烈醫院；
屯門醫院；
威爾斯親王醫院；及
北區醫院。


上述診所將於原址繼續提供服務，並與現時醫管局於六間公立醫院的牙科及口腔頜面外科服務合併，有助進一步理順和優化整體服務安排。

為確保醫管局接辦服務後病人獲得連貫性的照顧，所有病人於二○二六年二月六日或以後於上述七間口腔頜面外科及牙科診所的排期╱覆診期紀錄，以及儲存於該七間診所的個案及病人醫療紀錄，包括臨床紀錄、X光紀錄、臨床照片及牙模等，將一併移交醫管局。如病人或其家屬不同意將個案及相關醫療紀錄轉交醫管局以繼續跟進和處理，請於二○二六年一月十六日或之前，致電3153 4044或以電郵（hds_enquiry@dh.gov.hk）通知衞生署，以便作出相關安排。

退出安排的病人如已預約於明年二月六日或之後應診，其覆診期將會被取消；而日後若要到醫管局的牙科及口腔頜面外科求診，須遞交新轉介信以作預約，並根據醫管局安排繳付新症的診症費用。所有被病人拒絕轉交醫管局的醫療紀錄，將會由衞生署在服務轉移後按照其檔案管理政策處理及銷毀。如有任何查詢，歡迎聯絡衞生署。"
Integration of Hospital Dental Service of Department of Health into Hospital Authority,2025-12-15 15:00,2025-12-15 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500282.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) and the Hospital Authority (HA) today (December 15) announced that the Hospital Dental Service (HDS) currently provided by the DH will be integrated with the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS) Service under the HA from February 6, 2026, and the service will be taken up by the HA.

  As outlined in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"", a comprehensive review of the positioning and objectives of the healthcare system is under way, involving reforms of the functions and division of responsibilities among the HA, the DH and the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission). The DH will focus on its public health functions and executing its regulatory and enforcement roles. To implement this policy direction, the clinical services of the DH are being gradually integrated with either the HA or the PHC Commission.

  Following the earlier transfer of the DH's Clinical Genetic Service to the HA, the DH's HDS will be managed by the HA startingFebruary 6next year. In fact, the seven Oral Maxillofacial Surgery and Dental Clinics (OMS&DCs) under the DH's HDS are all located within the following HA public hospitals, primarily providing specialist oral maxillofacial surgery and dental treatment for hospital in-patients, patients with special oral healthcare needs, and dental emergencies:


Queen Mary Hospital;
Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital;
Queen Elizabeth Hospital;
Princess Margaret Hospital;
Tuen Mun Hospital;
Prince of Wales Hospital; and
North District Hospital.


  These clinics will continue to operate at the original sites and integrate with the existing OMS service in six public hospitals provided by the HA. This will help further streamline and optimise the overall service delivery.

  To ensure continuity in patient care upon the transfer of service, all scheduled/follow-up appointment records for patients at the aforementioned seven OMS&DCs for dates on or afterFebruary 6, 2026, along with the cases and relevant medical records stored at these clinics, including clinical records, X-ray records, clinical photos, and dental casts, will be transferred to the HA. If patients/family members do not agree to have their cases and relevant medical records transferred to the HA, they should contact the DH by phone at3153 4044or by email (hds_enquiry@dh.gov.hk)on or beforeJanuary 16, 2026, to facilitate the necessary arrangements.

  Patients who opt out of the arrangements should note that their follow-up appointments scheduled on or afterFebruary 6next year will be cancelled. Should they require future consultations at the HA's dental and OMS services, a new referral letter will be required for appointments, and new case consultation fees will be charged according to the HA's arrangements. Medical records that patients/family members refuse to transfer to the HA will be disposed of and destroyed by the DH in accordance with its record management policy after the service transfer. For enquiries about the arrangements, please contact the DH."

法庭將黎智英和三間被告公司的案件，以及早前已承認控罪的八人的關連案件，一併押後至二○二六年一月十二日聽取求情，然後公布判刑日期。

行政長官李家超表示︰「法庭裁定黎智英及《蘋果日報》相關三間公司罪名成立，確認黎智英利用《蘋果日報》勾結外國或境外勢力，危害國家安全。」

「黎智英長期利用旗下媒體《蘋果日報》肆意製造社會矛盾、挑撥社會對立，煽動仇恨、美化暴力，公然乞求外國制裁中國、制裁香港特區、招引外部干預。黎智英損害國家根本利益和香港市民福祉，其行可恥，其心歹毒。黎智英恣意妄為的罪行是在眾目睽睽下進行，證據確鑿，法庭的定罪判決彰顯了法律的正義，維護了香港的核心價值。法律從不容許任何職業或背景的人假借人權、民主和自由之名，公然傷害自己的國家及同胞。香港特區有責任維護國家安全，會堅決打擊危害國家安全的行為和活動。香港是法治社會，特區政府有法必依、違者必究、執法必嚴，我們會全力防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，履行這天經地義的責任。」

李家超強調：「特區政府旗幟鮮明，司法機構理直氣壯，無懼任何威嚇，堅定履行維護國家安全的責任。」

法庭審判不偏不倚

特區政府發言人指出：「法庭就本案頒下的裁決理由長達855頁，完全公開供公眾查閱，鉅細無遺地説明法庭對相關法律原則和證據的分析，以及裁定黎智英和三間被告公司有罪的理由。法庭在裁決理由中清楚表明，黎智英並非因其政治觀點或信念受審。法庭的定罪裁決有理有節，充分展現法庭嚴格依照法律和證據作出裁決，不受任何干涉，更絕無任何政治考慮。」

法庭於裁決理由中清楚指出，黎智英長年對中國懷有怨憤和憎恨。遠在《香港國安法》實施前，黎智英已經構思美國可以利用哪些手段制衡中國。當二○一九年的示‍威演變成抗爭運動，黎智英及《蘋果日報》是‍走在抗爭運動最前線的其中一員。案中大量文件證據支持控方證人的證供屬誠實可靠，包括黎智英的即時通訊軟件記錄，證明Mark Simon積極為他安排與美國高層官員、國會議員、政客等會面，表達希望美國對中國和香港特區實施制裁、封鎖和敵對行動；黎智英指示《蘋果日報》高層發起一人一信行動，藉此爭取美國對中國實施制裁。

法庭指出，《香港國安法》實施後，雖然黎智英請求制裁的言行變得含蓄和隱晦，但是不論在《香港國安法》實施前或後，他的唯一意圖就是，即使要犧牲中國和香港特區人民的利益，也要謀求中國共產黨倒台。法庭認為黎智英作證時多處自相矛盾、前後不一、閃爍其詞和不足為信，法庭拒絕接納他的證供。黎智英是三項控罪所指的串謀的首腦，他的所作所為顯示他意圖實施該等串謀，對中國和香港特區的國家安全構成威脅和傷害。

外部勢力攻擊抹黑不攻自破

特區政府發言人續指︰「特區政府留意到在『黎智英案』的執法、檢控、審判各個階段，均有來自四方八面的抹黑攻擊、干預施壓，特別是以美西方為首的外部勢力一直不斷抹黑香港特區的執法行動和司法程序，又以卑劣政治操弄和謊言企圖美化黎智英及其團夥的犯罪行為，更以所謂的『制裁』恫嚇法官、檢控官、執法人員及其他特區政府官員，試圖干預香港特區法院依法進行審判，作出妨礙司法公正和破壞法治的行為。任何合理、明辨是非的人，只要詳細了解法庭今天頒下的裁決理由，都會認同法庭審判不偏不倚；外部勢力的卑鄙圖謀終會徒勞無功，不攻自破。」

發言人強調︰「對於外部勢力的惡意攻擊，特區政府必須嚴正反駁。首先，法庭的審訊公開、公平、公正。法庭經過總共多達156日的公開聆訊，審視了多達2 220項證物、超過80 000頁文件，14名控方證人的證詞，黎智英本人更出庭作供多達52天。這些都是黎智英和其他被告經過公平審訊後才被裁定有罪的清楚證明。」

「一些別有用心的人將本案的犯罪行為與新聞自由混為一談，外部勢力借本案和其他危害國家安全犯罪案件炒作詆譭香港特區的法治和人權狀況。但事實是，香港居民享有《基本法》和《香港人權法案》保障的新聞和言論自由。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括新聞、言論、出版等自由。但與世界其他地方一樣，新聞從業員和其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。根據《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條、《歐洲人權公約》以及相關判例確立的原則，傳媒及新聞從業員在發布言論、資訊和文章時，必須遵守和履行「特別責任和義務」，包括保障國家安全或公共秩序；新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由的保障。」

「此外，本案公開審訊中，揭示了黎智英多次親自勾結外國勢力，乞求對中央和香港特區政府的制裁、封鎖和敵對行動。『黎智英案』與新聞自由完全無關，各被告只是多年來利用新聞報道為幌子，行禍國害港之實。」

黎智英羈押期間得到適切待遇及醫療照顧

「外部勢力更一直無視客觀事實，肆意抹黑懲教署，包括多番指黎智英在獄中沒有得到妥善醫療、宗教服務，及一直被所謂『單獨囚禁』，妄圖利用這些捏造指控影響法庭。但正如特區政府多次駁斥，懲教署一直致力為所有在囚人士，不論身分，提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境；懲教署處理黎智英的有關事宜，均採取以上安排，與其他在囚人士無異。」

「特別是在醫療服務方面，黎智英羈押期間所獲得的醫療服務完備。懲教署為在囚人士提供的醫療服務由衞生署與醫院管理局提供，一般情況會由進駐懲教院所的醫護人員提供檢查及治療，而按個別在囚人士的需要，亦會將個案轉介到醫院管理局轄下的專科部門跟進。專業的醫護人員會為病人提供最適切的醫療服務，對所有在囚人士亦一視同仁。代表黎智英的資深大律師亦有向法庭清楚表明，懲教院所為黎智英每日安排醫療檢查，黎智英對懲教院所內獲得的醫療服務無任何投訴，法官表示懲教署值得稱讚。」

「宗教服務方面，懲教署亦有安排專職教士按黎智英的意願提供宗教服務，包括領聖餐。至於所謂『單獨監禁』，事實是懲教署署長根據《監獄規例》可作出有關囚犯不應與其他囚犯交往的安排，其中一個目的，是保障囚犯人身安全與福祉。有關黎智英的安排，一直根據黎智英本人的意願，並由懲教署經考慮所有相關因素後依法安排的。」

「懲教署亦設有一系列機制，例如透過太平紳士定期巡視的安排，確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。如在囚人士有所不滿，可透過署內或者署外不同途徑，例如向申訴專員作出申訴。」

國家安全風險仍須嚴防

「『黎智英案』審訊期間，外部敵對勢力一直藉本案抹黑攻擊特區政府依法履行維護國家安全的重要職責，甚至對中央和特區政府的官員實施所謂『制裁』。同時，潛逃海外的反中亂港分子，包括指明潛逃者及通緝犯，在外部勢力的包庇下繼續從事危害國家安全的行為和活動，繼續到處叫囂。此外，外部勢力和其代理人繼續透過『軟對抗』，煽動市民對中央和特區政府的憎恨。此等情況在在反映香港特區仍然面對國家安全風險，絕對不能掉以輕心。」

「維護國家安全只有進行時，沒有完成時。在地緣政治風險不斷升溫、外部勢力和反中亂港分子仍持續為香港特區帶來國安風險挑戰的今天，特區政府必定繼續在《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的堅實保障下，堅定不移維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，持續完善相關法律制度和執行機制，以有效應對不斷變化的國安風險形勢，以高水平安全護航高質量發展，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。」"

法律從不容許任何職業或背景的人假借人權、民主和自由之名，公然傷害自己的國家及同胞。香港特區有責任維護國家安全，會堅決打擊危害國家安全的行為和活動。香港是法治社會，特區政府有法必依、違者必究、執法必嚴，我們會全力防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，履行這天經地義的責任。

我強調特區政府旗幟鮮明，司法機構理直氣壯，無懼任何威嚇，堅定履行維護國家安全的責任。

法庭的判辭總共有800多頁。政府會詳細研究判辭，稍後會再作更全面的聲明。我現在出發到北京述職。多謝大家。"

性罪行定罪紀錄查核機制擴大至涵蓋志願工作者,2025-12-15 09:30,2025-12-15 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121200595.htm,"為進一步加強對兒童及精神上無行為能力人士的保護，政府今日（十二月十五日）起擴大性罪行定罪紀錄查核機制涵蓋範圍至志願工作者。同時，政府亦增設三間指定警署，為合資格申請人提供24小時套取指紋服務。

政府發言人說：「志願工作者包括但不限於義教老師、義務運動教練等。查核機制仍屬自願性質，由招募機構自行評估風險後考慮查核需要，並由合資格申請人辦理申請。」

為進一步便利申請人，除位於灣仔警察總部的性罪行定罪紀錄查核辦事處及現有的六間指定警署（北角、油麻地、牛頭角、屯門、沙田及荃灣）外，警務處增設三間指定警署（將軍澳、上水和大嶼山北（東涌）），以提供24小時套取指紋服務。合資格申請人可透過網上平台遞交申請及預約前往提交指紋。

政府自二○一一年底推行查核機制，讓僱主查核從事與兒童或精神上無行為能力人士有關工作的人士，有否任何指明列表中的性罪行刑事定罪紀錄。在推行時，查核機制的合資格申請人涵蓋向機構或企業應徵與兒童或精神上無行為能力人士有關工作的準僱員、合約續期僱員，以及由外判機構派往其他機構或企業提供有關工作的僱員。

香港法律改革委員會（法改會）於二○二二年五月發表《性罪行檢討中的判刑及相關事項》，建議擴大查核機制涵蓋範圍至所有現有僱員、自僱人士和志願工作者。

為加強對兒童或精神上無行為能力人士的保障並回應法改會的建議，政府已由二○二四年底實施擴展計劃的第一階段，把查核機制的涵蓋範圍擴展至準自僱人士，並推出首階段優化措施，包括推出網上申請、24小時套取指紋服務及延長查核申請的有效期至36個月，以方便申請人。

發言人說：「政府會參考在首兩個階段將查核機制涵蓋範圍擴大至準自僱人士和志願工作者的相關經驗，適時考慮將涵蓋範圍擴展至所有現有僱員及自僱人士，以達成最終目標。屆時會再公布詳情。」"
Sexual Conviction Record Check Scheme expanded to cover volunteers,2025-12-15 09:30,2025-12-15 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121200598.htm,"To further strengthen the protection of children and mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs), the Government expanded the Sexual Conviction Record Check (SCRC) Scheme to cover volunteers today (December 15). Meanwhile, three additional designated police stations were introduced to provide eligible applicants with a 24-hour fingerprint taking service.

A spokesperson for the Government said, ""Volunteers include, but are not limited to, volunteer teachers and volunteer sports coaches. The SCRC Scheme remains voluntary in nature. The recruiting organisations may decide whether the SCRC is necessary after assessing the risks. Applications are to be submitted by the eligible applicants.""

In addition to the existing SCRC Office at the Police Headquarters in Wan Chai and the six existing designated police stations (North Point, Yau Ma Tei, Ngau Tau Kok, Tuen Mun, Sha Tin and Tsuen Wan), the Police designated three additional police stations to provide a 24-hour fingerprint-taking service, namely Tseung Kwan O, Sheung Shui and Lantau North (Tung Chung) to further facilitate the making of applications. Eligible applicants can submit applications through the online applications platform and make appointments for fingerprint taking.

The Government implemented the SCRC Scheme at the end of 2011 to enable employers to check whether persons undertaking child-related or MIPs-related work have any criminal conviction records against a specified list of sexual offences. When it was launched, the SCRC Scheme covered prospective employees, contract renewal staff and staff assigned by outsourced service providers to other organisations or enterprises, who apply for child-related or MIP-related work to organisations or enterprises.

In May 2022, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong (LRC) published a report on Sentencing and Related Matters in the Review of Sexual Offences, which recommended the expansion of the SCRC Scheme to all existing employees, self-employed persons and volunteers.

To enhance the protection to children and MIPs, and respond to the LRC's recommendations, the Government expanded the scope of the SCRC Scheme at the end of 2024 as phase 1 to cover prospective self-employed persons. A series of measures has been implemented at the same time to enhance the SCRC Scheme, including the launch of online applications, the introduction of a 24-hour fingerprint-taking service and the extension of the validity period to 36 months, bringing greater convenience to applicants.

""The Government will review the relevant experiences in expanding the scope of the SCRC Scheme to prospective self-employed persons and volunteers in the first two phases, and consider expanding the scope to cover all existing employees and self-employed persons at a suitable juncture, thus achieving the ultimate goal. Details will be available nearer the time,"" the spokesman said."

Starting from tomorrow until February 28, 2026, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) can receive up to three free CM consultation services, including the provision of medication and related treatments based on their clinical needs, through the arrangement of the District Health Centres/ District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong. The scope of free CM consultation services covers health conditions that may arise after the fire, such as emotional changes, insomnia, palpitations; coughing, wheezing, dry throat, and itchy throat; physical weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, dyspepsia; as well as pain and musculoskeletal injuries.

  Meanwhile, PHC Commission has earlier announced the establishment of a free family doctor service scheme to support the affected residents. Serving as hubs, the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have arranged case managers to follow up on the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents comprehensively. Based on the situations of individual cases and the preferences of affected residents, case managers will pair them with private sector family doctors participating in the scheme or the Hospital Authority's Family Medicine Out-patient Services.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

   As of this morning, a total of 1 390 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 3 235 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS).

   Currently, there is still an abundant supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer term accommodation. The transitional housing and HKHS projects in different districts can altogether provide around 400 units at the moment. Besides, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide an immediate supply of around 800 units.

   In consideration of the extremely urgent situation of the residents affected by the fire incident, a special arrangement of a full rent exemption has been made earlier by the Housing Bureau to provide accommodation support to those affected residents moving into transitional housing or HKHS projects. In other words, if needed, the affected residents can stay for a longer period of time. The Government will continue to support the affected residents in terms of accommodation, and the residents in need do not have to worry about the relevant rental expenses or the duration of stay.

   In addition, staff from the operating organisations of transitional housing and HKHS, as well as volunteers have been working around the clock to furnish the units with essential supplies, striving to meet the needs of the residents. Taking Kai Fook Kui in Kai Tak as an example, each unit is equipped, upon move-in, with furniture and appliances such as bed frames, mattresses, cooking stoves and water heaters. Furthermore, thoughtful members of the community have donated toys and musical instruments for children and elderly in need, bringing them warmth and care.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 800 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, about 23 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-14 17:30,2025-12-14 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/14/P2025121400465.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 14), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 79 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and the relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373). All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
