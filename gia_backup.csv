DoJ establishes high-level preparatory group for aligning with 15th Five-Year Plan (with photos),2026-02-20 18:05,2026-02-20 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000515.htm,"  The Department of Justice (DoJ) announced today (February 20) the establishment of its high-level preparatory group for aligning with the 15th Five-Year Plan. The preparatorygroup will commence preparatory work for the upcoming release of the National 15th Five-Year Plan, making more comprehensive, precise and detailed strategic arrangements for the 15th Five-Year Plan and proactively leveraging the role of Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services in national development.

  The preparatorygroup is chaired by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and vice-chaired by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan. Members include the Law Officer (Civil Law), the Solicitor General, the Law Officer (International Law), and the Director of Administration and Development of the DoJ. The secretaries of the Group are the Principal Government Counsel of the Legal Enhancement and Development Office and the Director of the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Office.

  Thepreparatory group convened its first meeting today to discuss the DoJ's key areas of development, staffing and resource allocation under the 15th Five-Year Plan. Once the contents and details of the 15th Five-Year Plan are released, the preparatory group will be converted into a working group to advance various tasks of proactively aligning with the 15th Five-Year Plan. As directed by the Chief Executive, Hong Kong's five-year blueprint in aligning with the country's 15th Five-Year Plan will be completed within this year, furtherpromoting Hong Kong's better integration into and contribution to the overall national development.

  Mr Lam said that as the inaugural year of the 15th Five-Year Plan begins, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan, which set out Hong Kong's strategic position as the ""three centres and a hub"", to consolidate and enhance the city's status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, and to support Hong Kong in building itself into an international hub for high-calibre talent. In promoting the development of the rule of law, the recommendations include accelerating the development of a foreign-related legal system and capabilities, and improving mediation, arbitration, and litigation mechanisms for international commercial disputes. In the 15th Five-Year Plan, Hong Kong can strive to play its role by showcasing its strengths in internationalised, high-standard, and highly credible legal and dispute resolution services, and by actively contributing to the training of international legal talent. By proactively aligning with the 15th Five-Year Plan, Hong Kong will further contribute to the country's efforts in promoting the foreign-related rule of law and in building a higher-level of rule of law in China."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-20 17:30,2026-02-20 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000484.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月二十日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球正值冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-20 17:30,2026-02-20 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000485.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 20), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.
	

The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

​
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

(Approved for Issue by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on February 4, 2026)

Report on Currency Board Operations (October 9 – December 29, 2025)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Currency Board Sub-Committee (Sub-Committee) noted that the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) traded within a range of 7.7673 – 7.7900 against the US dollar (USD) during the review period. The HKD strengthened in mid-October, supported by demand for dividend payments and continued net inflows from the Southbound Stock Connect, and eased in mid-November amid softened interest rates before firming towards the year-end on seasonal demand. While HKD interbank rates (HIBORs) generally tracked their USD counterparts under the Linked Exchange Rate System, they were also influenced by the local supply and demand of HKD funding. HIBORs generally eased during October and November, driven by equity-related demand, before firming again towards the year-end on seasonal factors. Meanwhile, with the decrease in the target range for the US federal funds rate in Q4, many banks reduced their Best Lending Rates by 12.5 basis points in early November and did not further cut the rates in December, with the Best Lending Rates in the market ranging from 5.000 per cent – 5.500per cent at the end of the review period. The Convertibility Undertakings were not triggered and the Aggregate Balance was stable at around HK$54 billion. No abnormality was noted in the usage of the Discount Window. Overall, the HKD exchange and interbank markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.

The Sub-Committee noted that the Monetary Base increased to HK$2,040.65 billion at the end of the review period. In accordance with the Currency Board principles, all changes in the Monetary Base had been fully matched by changes in foreign reserves.

The Report on Currency Board Operations for the review period is atAnnex.

Monitoring of Risks and Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------------
The Sub-Committee noted that in the US, while the trade truce and government reopening eased market jitters, the economy continued to face challenges stemming from a ""K-shaped"" consumption divergence, concerns over the sustainability of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and a weakening labour market. In Asia, while export diversification and the AI boom had so far supported economic growth, lingering trade policy uncertainty and potentially large propagation effects of the US trans-shipment tariffs continued to pose headwinds for the region's economic outlook.

The Sub-Committee noted that in the Chinese Mainland, economic growth moderated in October and November 2025. However, the recent China-US trade truce should help ease the downward pressures on China's near-term exports and real GDP growth. In the face of a profoundly complex environment, China would build a modern industrial system, enhance technological self-reliance, and boost consumption in the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026-2030).

The Sub-Committee noted that in Hong Kong, the economy continued to grow in Q4 2025, underpinned by solid growth in merchandise exports and further stabilisation in retail sales. Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy was projected to grow at a moderate pace in 2026, supported by ongoing demand for tech products and improved business sentiment amid eased trade tensions and interest rate cuts. Meanwhile, the housing market recovered further alongside easing financial conditions, whereas the commercial real estate markets continued to face challenges of high vacancy rates.

Outlook for Hong Kong's Financial and Monetary Conditions
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sub-Committee noted a paper that examined global economic outlook and monetary policy environment, and the implications for Hong Kong's financial and monetary conditions."

貨幣發行委員會（委員會）獲悉，於報告期內，港元兌美元在7.7673至7.7900之間上落。港元匯率在十月中因受到股息派發需求及港股通南向資金持續錄得淨流入支持而轉強，至十一月中隨着利率回軟而轉弱，接近年底時因季節性需求再度轉強。在聯繫匯率制度下，港元銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率走勢，同時亦受本地港元資金供求情況影響。在股市相關需求帶動下，港元銀行同業拆息在十月至十一月期間大致回落，接近年底時因受到季節性因素影響而再度上升。與此同時，隨着美國聯邦基金利率目標區間在第四季下調，多間銀行於十一月初將其最優惠貸款利率調低12.5基點，於十二月則未有進一步調低利率。於報告期末，市場上的最優惠貸款利率介乎5.000厘至5.500厘之間。報告期內兌換保證沒有被觸發，總結餘維持穩定，約為540億港元。貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。整體而言，港元外匯及銀行同業市場交易繼續暢順有序。

委員會獲悉，於報告期末時貨幣基礎增加至20,406.5億港元。貨幣基礎的所有變動與外匯儲備的變動完全一致，符合貨幣發行局制度的原則。

報告期內貨幣發行局制度的運作報告載於附件。

對風險及不穩定因素的監察
————————————

委員會注意到，美國方面，盡管貿易休戰及政府重啓令市場憂慮有所緩和，但「K型」消費分歧、對人工智能熱潮持續性的憂慮，以及勞工市場放緩，仍繼續對經濟帶來挑戰。亞洲方面，雖然迄今出口多元化及人工智能熱潮支撐區內經濟增長，但貿易政策的持續不確定性及美國對轉運貨品徵收關稅可能引發較大的連鎖反應，仍繼續對區內經濟前景構成下行壓力。

委員會注意到，中國內地經濟增長在二○二五年十月及十一月放緩。然而，最近的中美貿易休戰應有助減輕中國短期內出口及實質國內生產總值增長的下行壓力。面對極度複雜的環境，中國將在「十五五」時期（二○二六年至二○三○年）建設現代化產業體系、提高科技自立自強及促進消費。

委員會注意到，香港經濟於二○二五年第四季持續增長，受惠於商品出口穩健增長及零售進一步回穩。展望未來，預期香港經濟在二○二六年將以溫和步伐增長，當中科技產品的持續需求，以及貿易摩擦緩和及減息令營商氣氛改善均帶來支持。另一方面，隨着金融狀況變得較寬鬆，住宅市場進一步復蘇，而商用物業市場則繼續面對高空置率的挑戰。

二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月失業及就業不足統計數字,2026-02-20 16:30,2026-02-20 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000263.htm,"根據政府統計處今日（二月二十日）發表的最新勞動人口統計數字（即二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月的臨時數字），經季節性調整的失業率由二零二五年十月至十二月的3.8%上升至二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月的3.9%。就業不足率在該兩段期間則保持不變，維持於1.7%的水平。

與二零二五年十月至十二月比較，在二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月期間，各行業的失業率（不經季節性調整）及就業不足率變動不一，但幅度普遍不大。失業率（不經季節性調整）的上升主要見於保險業、建造業，以及金融業；而下跌則主要見於運輸業，以及清潔及同類活動業。

總就業人數由二零二五年十月至十二月的3 667 000人，下跌至二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月的3 665 900人，減少約1 100人。二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月的總勞動人口為3 804 300人，與二零二五年十月至十二月的數字（3 805 200人）大致相若。

二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月的失業人數（不經季節性調整）為138 400人，與二零二五年十月至十二月的數字（138 200人）大致相若。就業不足人數方面，二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月的數字為65 100人，與二零二五年十月至十二月的數字（64 800人）大致相若。

評論

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡評論最新失業數字時表示：「二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月經季節性調整的失業率較上一個三個月期間微升0.1個百分點至3.9%。與此同時，就業不足率維持在1.7%不變。勞動人口與上一個三個月期間的水平大致相若。同期總就業人數稍微下跌。」

展望未來，孫玉菡說：「香港經濟持續增長的勢頭應有助支持整體勞工市場。然而，一些行業的就業情況或會在經營環境的挑戰下繼續受壓。」

進一步資料

失業和就業不足的統計數字，是根據持續進行的「綜合住戶統計調查」結果而編製。

統計調查所採用有關失業及就業不足的定義，緊隨國際勞工組織的建議。當中，就業人口涵蓋所有僱主、自營作業者、僱員（包括全職、兼職及散工等）和無酬家庭從業員。而按行業（或職業）劃分的失業人士是按其以前從事的行業（或職業）劃分。

二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月的統計調查所用的樣本，是通過一個根據科學方法設計的抽樣系統選出，包括約26 000個住戶，共約67 000人，以代表本港人口的情況。根據這個樣本編製而成的勞工統計數字反映二零二五年十一月至二零二六年一月的移動三個月期間的情況。

統計調查是向樣本中各住戶內每名15歲或以上的成員進行訪問，以搜集有關勞動人口特徵的資料。

Unemployment and underemployment statistics for November 2025 - January 2026,2026-02-20 16:30,2026-02-20 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000273.htm,"  According to the latest labour force statistics (i.e. provisional figures for November 2025 - January 2026) released today (February 20) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased from 3.8% in October - December 2025 to 3.9% in November 2025 - January 2026. The underemployment rate remained unchanged at 1.7% in the two periods.

  Comparing November 2025 - January 2026 with October - December 2025, movements in the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) and underemployment rate in different industry sectors varied, but the magnitudes were generally not large. Increases in the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) were mainly seen in the insurance sector, construction sector and financing sector while decreases were mainly seen in the transportation sector and cleaning and similar activities sector.

  Total employment decreased by around 1 100 from 3 667 000 in October - December 2025 to 3 665 900 in November 2025 - January 2026. The labour force in November 2025 - January 2026 was 3 804 300, about the same as that in October - December 2025 (3 805 200).

  The number of unemployed persons (not seasonally adjusted) in November 2025 - January 2026 was 138 400, about the same as that in October - December 2025 (138 200). The number of underemployed persons in November 2025 - January 2026 was 65 100, about the same as that in October - December 2025 (64 800).

Commentary

  Commenting on the latest unemployment figures, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, said, ""The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged up by 0.1 percentage point over the preceding three-month period to 3.9% in November 2025 - January 2026. Meanwhile, the underemployment rate remained unchanged at 1.7%. The labour force was broadly on a par with the level in the preceding three-month period. Over the same period, total employment saw a marginal decrease.""

  Looking ahead, Mr Sun said, ""The sustained growth momentum of the Hong Kong economy should help buttress the overall labour market. Nonetheless, the employment situations in some sectors may continue to be under pressure amid their challenging operating environments.""

Further information

  The unemployment and underemployment statistics were compiled from the findings of the continuous General Household Survey.

  In the survey, the definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment follow closely those recommended by the International Labour Organization. The employed population covers all employers, self-employed persons, employees (including full-time, part-time, casual workers, etc.) and unpaid family workers. Unemployed persons by industry (or occupation) are classified according to their previous industry (or occupation).

  The survey for November 2025 - January 2026 covered a sample of some 26 000 households or 67 000 persons, selected in accordance with a scientifically designed sampling scheme to represent the population of Hong Kong. Labour force statistics compiled from this sample represented the situation in the moving three-month period of November 2025 to January 2026.

  Data on labour force characteristics were obtained from the survey by interviewing each member aged 15 or over in the sampled households.

  Statistical tables on the latest labour force statistics can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode200.html). More detailed analysis of the labour force characteristics is given in the ""Quarterly Report on General Household Survey"" which is published four times a year. The latest issue of the report contains statistics for the quarter July - September 2025 while the next issue covering the quarter October - December 2025 will be available by end February 2026. Users can also browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1050001&scode=200).

24名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2026-02-20 16:30,2026-02-20 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000461.htm,"24名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於二月六日及今日（二月二十日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款介乎600元至8,800元，合計罰款共67,800元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 488宗個案，而就法庭已處理的1 108宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及973名分間單位業主，合計總罰款共2,929,260元，另有380宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該24名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；（二）要求租客付還經分攤的水及／或電費時沒有出示繳費單副本及提供書面帳目；（三）沒有提供租金收據予租客及（四）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

24 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2026-02-20 16:30,2026-02-20 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000464.htm,"  Twenty-four landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $600 and $8,800, amounting to a total of $67,800, on February 6 and today (February 20) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 488 cases to date. Among the 1 108 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 973 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,929,260 in fines. In addition, 380 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 24 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; (2) failing to produce copies of the bills and provide an account in writing when requiring the tenant to pay for the reimbursement of the apportioned water and/or electricity charges; (3) failing to provide the tenant with a rent receipt; and (4) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon a comprehensive investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to enable SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."
"Property owner fined over $60,000 for not complying with removal order",2026-02-20 16:09,2026-02-20 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000447.htm,"​An owner was convicted and fined $65,230 in total, of which $50,230 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, at the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts today (February 20) for failing to comply with a removal order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

The case involved an unauthorised structure of about 9 square metres on the flat roof of a composite building on Yuen Long Tung Tai Street. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today, ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

有關個䅁涉及元朗東堤街一幢商住大廈平台上一個面積約九平方米的搭建物。該僭建物並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向業主發出清拆令。該業主沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"

四個泳灘的水質被評為良好（一級），兩個為一般（二級）。

一級泳灘包括：



清水灣第二灣泳灘
黃金泳灘


深水灣泳灘
銀線灣泳灘




二級泳灘包括：



更生灣泳灘
麗都灣泳灘




比較上周公布的泳灘等級，更生灣泳灘由一級轉為二級。

環保署發言人說：「這些泳灘水質的轉變屬一般泳灘細菌水質的正常變動。」

環保署根據海水中的大腸桿菌水平，將泳灘水質評定為四個等級，包括良好（一級）、一般（二級）、欠佳（三級）及極差（四級）。泳灘等級是根據最近五次水樣本中大腸桿菌的幾何平均數而計算。

環保署發言人提醒市民，雖然泳灘的等級反映泳灘於一般情況下的水質，但泳灘的水質在大雨期間及過後或會暫時受到影響，泳客應該避免在風暴或大雨後三天內前往泳灘游泳。

環保署會在每個周末前公布各泳灘等級摘要。市民可於環保署網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach_chi）查閱根據最新數據評定的泳灘等級，或致電環保署泳灘水質熱線2511 6666查詢。市民亦可透過環保署的泳灘水質預測專題網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/BWQForecast），獲取各開放予公眾使用的泳灘的每日最新水質預測資訊。"

Grading of beach water quality released,2026-02-20 16:00,2026-02-20 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000270.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (February 20) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1) and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, Casam Beach has been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."

Total lunar eclipse in Hong Kong on evening of March 3,2026-02-20 15:00,2026-02-20 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026021600335.htm,"A total lunar eclipse will occur in Hong Kong on the evening of March 3 (Tuesday). The total eclipse process can be directly observed with unaided eyes at places with an unobstructed view to the east, if weather permits.

The lunar eclipse will begin before moonrise. The moonrise time will be 6.22pm, when part of the moon has already entered the Earth's umbra. The moon will be completely engulfed in the umbra at 7.04pm, marking the beginning of the total eclipse phase. The maximum eclipse will occur at 7.34pm, and the moon will begin its exit from the umbra at 8.03pm. The total eclipse phase will last for 59 minutes. During the period, the moon will not completely disappear from sight but will appear dull red. This is the result of the blue light component of the sunlight being scattered by the Earth's atmosphere and the remaining red light being refracted onto the lunar surface. The entire process of the lunar eclipse will end at 10.25pm.

今次月食會在月出前開始，因此月亮會帶食而出。當晚月出時間為下午六時二十二分，月出前部分月球已經進入地球本影。下午七時零四分月球完全進入地球本影，即月全食開始。食甚時間為下午七時三十四分，至下午八時零三分月球開始離開地球本影。月全食階段歷時五十九分鐘，期間月亮不會從視線中完全消失，而是會呈現暗紅色。這是因為太陽光中藍色的波段在經過地球大氣層時被散射，剩餘的紅光再被折射到月球表面上。整個月食的過程會在下午十時二十五分完結。

尊敬的張勇副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李永勝副特派員（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、Carlson（香港交易及結算所有限公司主席唐家成、Bonnie（香港交易及結算所有限公司集團行政總裁陳翊庭）、Starry（立法會主席李慧琼）、Kelvin（證券及期貨事務監察委員會主席黃天祐博士）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

早晨！今天是大年初四，香港交易所馬年首日開市。先跟大家拜年，恭祝各位龍馬精神、萬事勝意、身體健康、財源廣進！

剛過去的蛇年，承接着龍年的氣勢，恒生指數累計上升接近6 500點，升幅32%，也是連續兩年上升，以點數及幅度計，去年是歷來表現最好的蛇年。IPO（首次公開招股）和後續籌資額均表現亮麗，股票市場的流動性亦顯著提升，資金來源也相當國際化。

蛇年港股表現突出，勢頭良好，讓我們對今年抱有更大的期盼。事實上，回顧過去四個馬年，有三個都是升市，而且都是錄得雙位百分比的升幅。總的來説，我對今年丙午馬年的市況是審慎樂觀的，因為我們資本市場的發展具備了馬的好幾個特質。

一是「駿馬奔騰，跨越險阻」。去年外圍環境風高浪急，但香港堅持自由開放的投資環境、穩定的經貿金融政策，讓我們成為了資金的安全港，國際投資者紛紛增加對香港市場的配置。展望今年，國際環境仍然複雜多變，波動在所難免。但是只要我們堅持做對的事，秉持開放、公平的市場環境、不斷推動市場的改革、做好市場的基建和發展、管理和應對好各種風險，我們的市場必能像駿馬一樣，跨越險阻，向前邁進。

二是「快馬加鞭，力爭上游」。科技變革正在加速演進，AI（人工智能）、生命科技，以至是量子計算等，正重塑經濟體的競爭力，也將深刻影響股票市場的發展和估值。香港股市過去幾年作了多輪的改革，支持新科技公司上市，配合新經濟發展。我們會繼續推動市場改革，例如檢視「同股不同權」的框架，吸引更多未來的創科企業來港上市。

與此同時，特區政府也會與監管機構、交易所和業界共同探索更多提升市場發展的新舉措，進一步豐富產品種類、提升交易機制，強化香港作為領先籌融資平台的競爭力。例如發展債券與股票互通的存託管理系統，推動跨產品、跨市場及跨範疇的抵押品互通，提升其流動性，並推動更多創新產品的推出。

三是「馳騁千里，大道致遠」。香港在「一國兩制」下有着內聯外通的獨特優勢。展望未來，國家「十五五」規劃將擴大高水平對外開放，香港作為國際金融中心，連接各地發行人、投資者與項目的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色必將更加突顯。

在國家和中央相關部委的堅實支持、特區政府、金融監管機構和業界的共同努力下，更多內地企業將通過香港融資「出海」，全球布局產供鏈；同時，互聯互通機制持續深化擴容，也將為本港資本市場引來更大的流動性。

另一方面，我們亦積極拓展與海外市場的聯繫，開拓新市場、匯聚新資金、引進新投資者。從爭取更多海內外發行人來港上市，到推動與海外市場ETF（交易所買賣基金）的互掛，一系列舉措將全面提升香港股票市場的廣度、深度與國際吸引力。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，有國家的大力支持，加上特區政府、監管機構和業界的通力合作，只要我們目標清晰，準確識變、科學應變、主動求變，並積極搶抓機遇，香港這匹金融駿馬，在百駿競逐的激烈競爭之中，定必一馬當先！

最後，衷心感謝各位金融界朋友過去一年的努力和貢獻，以及對特區政府工作的支持。恭祝各位馬年繼續一馬當先、鴻圖大展、龍馬精神、馬到功成！

  Now allow me to say a few words in English.

  Today marks the first trading day of the Year of the Horse. It’s a timely moment to reflect on the past and look ahead for the opportunities before us.

  We had a successful Year of the Snake, with the Hang Seng Index rising by nearly 6 500 points, up by 32 per cent. IPO (initial public offering) and follow-on fundraising were both robust. Market liquidity improved markedly, and sources of capital were highly diversified.

  I remain cautiously optimistic for the year ahead. Like a fine horse, our market will continue its resilience and vigour despite all the challenges. We will continue to accelerate reforms to support innovative and high-growth companies as well as overseas companies to list in Hong Kong. We will also fully leverage Hong Kong’s unique role as a two-way platform under the “one country, two systems” framework: deepening connectivity with both the Mainland and international markets, broadening our product offerings, attracting more global issuers and investors, and enhancing our financial infrastructure.

  With the strong support from our country and close collaboration across the Government, regulators and the industry, I’m confident that Hong Kong’s capital market will continue to advance with strength and vitality. Thank you, and best wishes for a prosperous Year of the Horse."

The Notice aims to amend Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Pesticides Ordinance (Cap. 133), listing two types of pesticides called carbosulfan and fenthion (ultra-low-volume formulations at or above 640 grams of active ingredient per litre) respectively, in order to give effect to the amendment to the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade in 2025 (the amendment) to list these two pesticides in its Annex III. The amendment to the Pesticides Ordinance will tighten the regulatory regime regarding these two pesticides, thereby safeguarding public health and protecting the environment. The Government will table the Notice at the Legislative Council on February 25, 2026.

A spokesman for the Environment and Ecology Bureau said, ""Carbosulfan and fenthion (ultra-low-volume formulations at or above 640g active ingredient per litre) are already regulated by pesticide permit conditions under the Pesticides Ordinance. Any person who imports, manufactures, sells, supplies, is in possession of or uses, etc, such pesticides must hold a valid permit. After carbosulfan and fenthion (ultra-low-volume formulations at or above 640g active ingredient per litre) are listed in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Pesticides Ordinance, their exports will be further restricted.""

The Convention is an international treaty for safeguarding human health and protecting the environment. The Convention, which implements a prior informed consent procedure in the international trade of specified hazardous chemicals, aims to promote shared responsibility and co-operative efforts among parties to the Convention, with a view to protecting human health and avoiding potential harm to the environment caused by such chemicals. The treaty entered into force in the People's Republic of China in 2005 and has been applicable to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region since 2008. The amendment entered into force for all Convention parties, including the People's Republic of China, on October 22, 2025.

The Notice published in the Gazette today stipulated that the amendment to the Pesticides Ordinance will enter into force in Hong Kong on April 17, 2026. Any person who exports, imports, manufactures, sells, supplies, possesses or uses, etc, carbosulfan and fenthion (ultra-low-volume formulations at or above 640g active ingredient per litre) without holding a pesticide permit commits an offence. Offenders will be liable to a fine at level 5 ($50,000) and imprisonment for one year upon conviction."

張德熙主席（香港黃金交易所主席）、各位香港黃金交易所的董事及仝人、各位來賓、各位傳媒朋友︰

恭喜發財！今日大年初四，我很高興可以與張德熙主席及各位香港黃金交易所的董事，一起主持香港黃金交易所新春開市的儀式。首先，我在此向各位拜年，祝大家馬年進步、萬事如意、財源廣進！

回顧過去一年，儘管外圍環境受到地緣政治的不確定因素影響，在國家的堅實支持與及政府和社會各界的共同努力下，香港資產市場表現進一步改善、資金持續流入，訪港旅客人數增加，整體出口和固定資本投資表現良好，本地消費亦趨穩定，二○二五年全年實質本地生產總值錄得3.5%的增長，較二○二四年2.6%的增長加快，並連續第三年錄得擴張。

香港金融服務業的不同板塊去年既鞏固優勢，亦持續增長。香港去年的首次公開招股（IPO）集資額排名世界第一，股票市場去年日均交投量接近2,500億港元，跟之前一年比較增長約九成。在不同金融範疇包括亞洲國際債券發行量，跨境財富管理規模，對沖基金規模，保險密度等香港繼續排名亞洲第一。在香港註冊成立的證監會認可基金在二○二五年錄得的淨資金流入約450億美元，較二○二四年增加約1.2倍; 香港銀行客戶整體存款於二○二五年增長達11.8%，而香港保險業二○二五年首三季臨時統計毛保費總額達到6,370億港元，按年上升32.5%。

為進一步多元發展我們的國際金融業務，特區政府正全力推動香港成為國際黃金交易中心，吸引黃金現貨在港進行儲存、清算及交割，帶動投資交易、衍生產品、倉儲、保險、貿易和物流等產業鏈的蓬勃發展。我們現以三年超越2 000噸為拓展在港黃金倉儲的目標，打造香港成為區域黃金儲備樞紐。我們正積極推動金商在港建立或擴建精煉廠，並已與深圳市地方金融管理局簽署合作備忘錄，依法依規支持香港金商通過加工貿易合作方式採用在深圳設立的黃金精煉設施，精煉黃金後出口至香港作交易及交割用途。我們將大力策動滬港黃金市場合作，並已在上月的亞洲金融論壇與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，未來共同參與並擴大國家在國際黃金市場中的份額及價格影響力。財庫局亦已成立由特區政府全資擁有的公司作為香港黃金中央清算系統的管治機構，目標是清算系統在今年內開展試營運。在推動大宗商品交易方面，現時已有15個倫敦金屬交易所認可的倉庫在香港營運。我們會支持業界設立更多認可倉庫。港交所亦會深化與廣州期貨交易所及內地其他大宗商品市場的聯通發展。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，政府將繼續推動政策優化、金融基建及科技創新，吸引更多國際資金與人才，讓香港發揮像馬一樣剛健雄壯、自強不息的特質，進一步強化香港作為「超級聯繫人」及「超級增值人」的角色，主動對接「十五五」規劃，融入和服務國家發展大局，鞏固及提升香港作為國際金融中心的地位。在此，我祝願香港黃金交易所業務蒸蒸日上、交投暢旺；祝大家一馬當先、龍馬精神、馬到功成、馬年大吉，謝謝。"
New York ETO marks Year of the Horse in New York (with photos),2026-02-20 03:59,2026-02-20 04:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026021900614.htm,"​The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in New York (New York ETO) welcomed the Year of the Horse at its annual Hong Kong Spring Reception in New York on February 18 (New York time), attended by more than 400 guests from the academic, business, cultural, government, media, non-profit and think tank sectors.

In her welcoming remarks, the Director of the New York ETO, Ms Maisie Ho, highlighted the steadfast economic and trade ties between Hong Kong and the United States. In 2025, the number of American companies in Hong Kong has increased by 11 per cent, reflecting continued confidence in the city's open and dynamic business environment. The latest survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong also showed rising optimism, with most firms planning to maintain or expand their investment in the coming year.

Ms Ho noted that Hong Kong's economy has demonstrated resilience, with advance estimates projecting GDP growth of 3.5 per cent in 2025. The city continues to attract global business and investment. In 2025, Hong Kong ranked first worldwide in IPO fundraising, raising US$37.4 billion across 119 listings, including two of the five largest IPOs globally. As at end-2025, Hong Kong was home to over 3 380 single-family offices, an increase of more than 25 per cent over two years.

Building on its strong economic momentum, Hong Kong is pressing ahead with the development of the Northern Metropolis to drive innovation-led growth. At the same time, the city is reinforcing its position as an international education hub – attracting outstanding students and global talent, while showcasing our world-class universities and research excellence.

To further deepen engagement across New York and the eastern United States, Ms Ho said the New York ETO will continue working closely with Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council through the Economic and Trade Express platform. Together, they will step up joint trade and investment promotion activities, identify new market opportunities, and support both Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland enterprises in expanding their global footprint.

  ""The horse symbolises vitality, resilience and momentum,"" said Ms Ho. ""Galloping into the Year of the Horse, Hong Kong embraces new opportunities with agility and determination. We will continue to transform ourselves amid global shifts, while maintaining our competitive edge as a premier hub for business, finance, trade and innovation, and foster partnerships and global connections worldwide.""

The reception featured a musical programme blending elements of Chinese New Year, the Year of the Horse and Western instruments. The pieces were composed by renowned Hong Kong composer Elliot Leung and performed by New York-based young musicians from Hong Kong. Mr Leung's work will also be featured in the upcoming New York Philharmonic's Lunar New Year Gala, showcasing Hong Kong's creative contributions on the international stage."

香港駐紐約經貿辦處長何美智致歡迎辭時表示，香港與美國之間一直保持穩固的經濟及貿易聯繫。駐港美國公司數目在二〇二五年增加百分之十一，反映企業持續看好香港開放且蓬勃的營商環境。香港美國商會的最新調查亦顯示市場氣氛更趨樂觀，大多數企業計劃於來年繼續或擴大在港投資。

何美智指出，香港經濟展現強韌性，初步估計二〇二五年本地生產總值錄得百分之三點五的增長，持續吸引全球企業和投資。二〇二五年，香港在全球首次公開招股集資額排名第一，共完成119宗上市，集資額達374億美元，其中包括全球五大首次公開招股中的兩宗。截至二〇二五年底，香港共有超過3 380間單一家族辦公室，較兩年前增長逾百分之二十五。

在穩健的經濟動力基礎上，香港正全力推進北部都會區發展，以創新帶動增長。同時，香港正鞏固其國際教育樞紐地位，吸引優秀學生和全球人才，並展現香港的世界級大學及卓越的科研實力。

為進一步深化與紐約以至美國東部地區的聯繫，何美智表示，香港駐紐約經貿辦將透過「經貿一站通」平台，繼續與投資推廣署和香港貿易發展局緊密合作，㩦手合辦貿易和投資推廣活動，發掘市場新機遇，以及支持香港和中國內地企業拓展全球業務。

何美智說：「馬象徵活力、韌性和動力。踏入馬年，香港將以靈活與決心迎接新機遇，在全球變局中持續蛻變，同時保持作為國際商業、金融、貿易及創新樞紐的競爭優勢，並促進全球夥伴合作和聯繫。」

酒會上，來自香港、現居紐約的年輕音樂家以西方樂器演奏多首由香港著名作曲家梁皓一創作、融合農曆新年和馬年元素的樂曲。紐約愛樂樂團於即將舉行的農曆新年音樂會上亦會演奏梁皓一的作品，向國際舞台展示香港的創意實力。"
