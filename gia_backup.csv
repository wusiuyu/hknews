產品資料如下：

產品名稱：紅茶雪糕
品牌：Kochi Ice
來源地：日本
淨容量：115毫升
此日期前最佳：二○二七年四月十八日
進口商：新大和（香港）有限公司

中心發言人說：「中心透過恆常食物監測計劃，在進口層面抽取上述樣本進行檢測。結果顯示，該樣本的大腸菌群含量為每克一百四十個，超出法例上限。」

根據《冰凍甜點規例》（第132AC章），任何供出售的冰凍甜點，每克不可含有多於一百個大腸菌群。違法者一經定罪，最高可處罰款一萬元及監禁三個月。大腸菌群含量超出法例標準，顯示產品的衞生情況欠理想，並不表示會引起食物中毒。

發言人說：「中心已知會涉事進口商上述違規事項。有關進口商已按中心指示將受影響產品停售和下架，並展開回收工作。市民可於辦公時間致電其熱線2647 1138，查詢有關產品的回收事宜。中心會暫時撤銷較早前簽發予有關進口商銷售該款產品的批准。」

Imported prepackaged frozen confection sample detected with coliform bacteria counts exceeding legal limits,2025-07-28 19:52,2025-07-28 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800731.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (July 28) that a sample of prepackaged frozen confection imported from Japan was detected with coliform bacteria count exceeding the legal limit. Some of the product concerned have entered the market. The importer concerned has stopped sale and removed from shelves the affected product, and has initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. The CFS is following up on the incident.

Product details:

Product name: Black Tea Ice Cream
Brand: Kochi Ice
Place of origin: Japan
Net volume: 115ml
Best-before date: April 18, 2027
Importer: Shin Tai Ho (Hong Kong) Company Limited

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample at the import level for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained 140 coliform bacteria per gram, exceeding the legal limit.""

Under the Frozen Confections Regulation (Cap. 132 AC), frozen confection for sale should not contain more than 100 coliform bacteria per gram. The maximum penalty for offenders is a fine of $10,000 and three months' imprisonment upon conviction. The fact that the coliform count exceeded the legal limit indicated that the hygienic conditions were unsatisfactory, but did not mean that consumption would lead to food poisoning.

""The CFS has informed the importer concerned of the irregularities. The importer concerned has stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected product, and has initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2647 1138 during office hours for enquiries about the recall of the product concerned. The CFS will temporarily suspend the permission to import for sale of the product concerned granted earlier to the importer,"" the spokesman said.

The CFS will inform the Japanese authority of the incident, and will continue to follow up on the case and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."

​運輸及物流局局長出席香港金融管理局數據峰會2025致辭（只有中文）,2025-07-28 19:08,2025-07-28 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800664.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（七月二十八日）出席香港金融管理局數據峰會2025的致辭全文：

Eddie（香港金融管理局總裁余偉文）、Fred（香港機場管理局主席林天福）、Mary（香港銀行公會主席禤惠儀）、Howard（香港金融管理局副總裁李達志）、各位金融界和銀行界的朋友：

多謝Eddie的邀請，很榮幸出席今日二○二五年數據峰會，亦是運輸及物流局首次參加這個峰會，別具意義。

剛才參觀展覽攤位時，銀行界、金融界和物流界提出了很多共通點，Eddie的開幕致辭證明了這點，給予我們很多正面的能量。運輸及物流局負責推動香港對內和對外的交通和運輸物流的工作，而推動社會的發展「power」很重要。說到「power」，我們局方最近常說綠色能源。我今日不跟大家談能源，而是談數據。正如Eddie所說，誰主宰數據、掌握數據，誰就可以定義未來。數據真是很「powerful」。

國家支持香港作為金融中心、航運中心、物流中心「三個中心」的戰略定位。我們常說這「三個中心」都非常重要，亦是我們的傳統優勢。其實三者之間息息相關、環環相扣，而數據可以作為三者的連繫。我們現時面對關稅戰、全球貿易和供應鏈都受不明朗因素影響、全球經濟格局都在逐漸重塑中。我們經常跟航空、物流、航運界別的業界說要團結一致，亦要有破局精神，要在現時很大的挑戰之中尋求突破。金融中心支撐物流和貨運方面的發展，而貿易中心亦靠機場或貨櫃碼頭的運作承載貨物，所以三者的確是缺一不可。

今日很開心看到香港金融管理局推動數據升級轉型，亦邀請了運輸及物流局和我們的業界參與你們的Project CargoX。剛才參觀攤位，我感受到有很多業界都在推動這方面的發展。Project CargoX正正是透過數據進行跨界協作，藉着數據協助例如中小企突破以往貿易和物流融資時的痛點。

我們經常說需要打通數據和貨物流通，航空方面，我知道Fred稍後和大家分享在航空方面如何做到關於數字和數據的平台，他們在這方面一直領先。我經常向Fred表示我很羨慕，為何在港口和航運物流不可以做類似的東西？究竟是甚麼令我們裹足不前？我們的業界一直很希望可以做到這一方面，今年我們做到了。我們成功在立法會取得撥款，由政府注資、政府牽頭、政府帶領，作為擔當衝破這一步。我們成功取得撥款後，在今年下半年會積極構建整個系統，但過去一兩年我們已就所有基建和系統的連接進行試驗及試點，所以在某些物流供應鏈上，我們已和業界有實戰經驗。二○二六年即明年的一月，我們就會構建好系統供業界使用。剛才大家如果有機會經過我們的攤位，可以了解到我們不會等構建完畢才讓業界使用。事實上，透過這個系統，我們的數據會有三個特點：第一，整個貨物追蹤會透明化；第二，因為系統是政府構建及營運，業界可以不用擔心數據外洩、又或擔心競爭者的情況，政府會主持公道，Let's do it；第三，透過數據在平台進行連接，我們希望做到貨物追蹤，從而助力貿易融資，利用區塊鏈技術，可以在平台上追蹤例如冷鏈貨物由出發點至目的地期間的實際的位置、以至溫度管控的資訊。

剛才很多銀行界朋友在展覽攤位向我們提及可以協助中小企貿易及融資，我在這方面不一一重覆，但在物流和航運界別而言，我們的確要關顧中小企。中小企很多時候要是處理一票貨的流轉，但融資時現時大都是用紙本證明，這不單令成本增加，審批時間亦長，以後資訊和數據便可取代紙本驗證。我們抓緊時間，負責營運這個系統的代辦LSCM（物流及供應鏈多元技術研發中心）已和業界有更進一步的試驗計劃和應用場景，亦有業界已經加入推動和試驗增值功能，包括貨流驗證和融資，進一步減省信貸成本和縮短審批程序。

另外值得一提的是，剛才展覽攤位提到跨境物流。我們在取得PCS（港口社區系統）的撥款後，已經第一時間進一步加深跨境或者區域協作。我們很希望能連通世界，所以已率先在五月和廣東省電子口岸管理有限公司簽訂合作備忘錄，將港口社區系統與廣東的電子口岸辦公室對接，方便日後業界「一單兩報」。在航運來說，他們可以預先填報、預先報關，整個流程就可以更快。

大家不得不知，雖然我們說港口吞吐量面對不少挑戰，但在國際航運綜合實力來說，香港位居第四，這不只包含吞吐量，更是質素和效率，及高端海運服務。我想藉今日的機會做兩個宣傳：第一，我們接下來在航空和航運方面會有「鐵海陸江」的概念，將距離香港非常遠的貨物透過香港與世界接軌。我們可以透過鐵路接通海運或陸運，現時不少內陸城市例如成都、重慶以至廣西已加強跨境電商甚至快檢，通過高鐵連接駁船來港。內地現時亦積極建構運河，將貨物運到樞紐機場和港口，所以透過今日所說的數據平台，特別是PCS，將可以促進多式聯運。

第二，在航運或航空方面，我們會邁向低碳和零碳。我們會建立平台，將內地新能源供應商和香港的船務運作或融資匯聚起來。最近，我們和國家商務部已經建構了平台，將不同持份者或企業連在一起。我很希望Project CargoX或「商業數據通」的概念可以放在綠色金融，不單金融產品可以更豐富和多元化，在航空和航運方面都可以助力我們作為國際航空樞紐和國際航運中心的發展。

我希望大家稍後有時間的話可以參觀LSCM的攤位，我亦希望多謝今日在座的物流業界朋友，沒有他們的支持，我們不可以這麼快取得撥款及建構這個系統。多謝大家。"
SED expresses deep sorrow over passing of Dr Hu Hung-lick,2025-07-28 18:55,2025-07-28 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800649.htm,"The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, today (July 28) expressed deep sorrow over the passing of the President of Hong Kong Shue Yan University, Dr Hu Hung-lick, and extended her heartfelt condolences to his family.

Dr Choi said, ""Dr Hu dedicated himself to education. Together with the late Dr Chung Chi-yung, they established Shue Yan College in 1971, striving to promote the popularisation of higher education and nurturing numerous young talent for society over the past half century. In 2006, Shue Yan College was officially renamed as Hong Kong Shue Yan University and became the first private university in Hong Kong, which was an important milestone in the local higher education. Guided by the motto of 'cultivating virtues of benevolence; broadening horizons and knowledge', Dr Hu cultivated students with both moral integrity and benevolence. His educational philosophy and enthusiasm have benefited generations of students, making him a true role model for the education sector.""

Dr Choi firmly believes that the selfless contributions and noble spirit of this educational pioneer will be remembered fondly by all."

是次演習有超過100名海關、入境事務處及消防處人員參與。演習模擬海關人員根據情報，在青衣海關驗貨場對一個可疑貨櫃進行查驗時，發現一名懷疑與恐怖組織有關的非法入境者匿藏其中。當海關人員進一步檢查櫃內貨物時，發現當中所載的危害物質出現洩漏。海關人員隨即啓動部門緊急應變計劃，並即時通報跨部門反恐專責組及相關部門。入境事務處接獲通知後，迅速出動流動鑑證戰術車到場，鑑證該懷疑非法入境者所持的旅行證件。消防處人員接報後亦迅速到場，調派危害物質專隊處理有關危害物質及進行洗消程序。

是次演習不單提升前線人員的反恐意識和處理反恐情報的能力，更加強了各部門在應對涉及恐怖活動緊急事件時的協作與溝通，切實保障市民生命財產及維護國家安全。"
Inter-departmental counter-terrorism intelligence handling and hazardous material incident exercise conducted (with photos),2025-07-28 18:45,2025-07-28 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800637.htm,"Hong Kong Customs, in collaboration with the Immigration Department (ImmD) and the Fire Services Department (FSD), conducted a joint counter-terrorism intelligence handling and hazardous material incident exercise codenamed ""TREADING SEA"" this afternoon (July 28) at the Tsing Yi Customs Cargo Examination Compound.

Over 100 officers from Hong Kong Customs, the ImmD and the FSD participated in the exercise. The exercise simulated a situation where Customs officers, acting on intelligence, inspected a suspicious container at the Tsing Yi Cargo Examination Compound and discovered an illegal immigrant suspected of being connected to a terrorist organisation hiding inside the container. During further inspection of goods inside the container, a leakage of hazardous material was found. Customs officers swiftly activated the departmental contingency response plan and notified the Inter-departmental Counter Terrorism Unit and relevant government departments. The ImmD promptly deployed their Mobile Identification Tactical Unit to the scene to verify the authenticity of the travel documents held by the illegal immigrant. FSD officers also attended the scene shortly upon being summoned, and the Hazardous Materials Team was deployed to carry out decontamination procedures and handle the hazardous material.

This exercise not only enhanced frontline officers' counter-terrorism awareness and their capabilities to handle counter-terrorism intelligence, but also strengthened inter-departmental coordination and communication in responding to terrorism-related emergencies, thereby protecting the lives and property of citizens as well as safeguarding national security."
發展局向港島南區一個政府工務工程建築工地致命工業事故的承建商及分包商作出規管行動,2025-07-28 18:44,2025-07-28 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800605.htm,"發展局發言人今日（七月二十八日）表示，就七月二十七日在港島南區一個政府工務工程建築工地發生的致命工業事故，涉事承建商是發展局認可公共工程承建商名冊內的承建商，而涉事分包商則是認可公共工程物料供應商及專門承造商名冊內的承建商。

局方作為政府工務工程服務採購方，一向十分重視認可名冊內的承建商在其轄下所有建築工地的安全表現。局方今日已按規管機制向涉事承建商及分包商發出通知，分別即時暫停涉事承建商建築類別及涉事分包商升降機、自動梯及乘客輸送帶裝置類別的工務工程投標資格。承建商及分包商須進行獨立安全審核，以檢視其安全管理系統，並按獨立安全審核結果提交改善方案及完成落實改善措施。待局方審視及確信其具備有效安全管理系統，才會考慮恢復其投標資格。有關暫停投標資格的規管行動不單適用於未來的招標，也適用於已經投標但尚未批出的工程合約。

勞工處現正就這宗工業事故進行調查並會依法處理，局方往後會因應調查結果，按需要對涉事承建商及分包商採取進一步規管行動，包括延長暫停投標資格的期限，甚至從認可名冊內除名。"
Development Bureau imposes regulating action on contractors and subcontractor involved in fatal industrial incident at public works construction site in Southern District on Hong Kong Island,2025-07-28 18:44,2025-07-28 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800609.htm,"   A spokesman for the Development Bureau (DEVB) said today (July 28) that regarding the fatal industrial incident that happened on July 27 at a public works construction site in Southern District on Hong Kong Island, the contractors concerned were on the List of Approved Contractors for Public Works (the List) and the subcontractor concerned was on the List of Approved Suppliers of Materials and Specialist Contractors for Public Works (the Specialist List).

   The DEVB, being the party to procure services for public works, attaches great importance to the site safety performance of all construction sites under the purview of contractors on the List and the Specialist List. The DEVB issued notifications to the contractors and subcontractor concerned today to suspend the contractors and subcontractor from tendering for public works contracts in the buildings category and the lift, escalator and passenger conveyor installation category respectively with immediate effect pursuant to the regulating regime. The contractors and subcontractor concerned have to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system. Taking cognisance of the outcome of the independent safety audit, the contractors and subcontractor are required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures, with a view to demonstrating that they have an effective safety management system before the lifting of the suspension from tendering can be considered. The suspension from tendering is not only confined to future tender exercises, but is also applicable to tender exercises with procedures initiated but not concluded.

   The Labour Department is investigating this industrial incident and will handle it in accordance with the law. Subject to the investigation findings, the DEVB may impose further regulating actions on the contractors and subcontractor concerned later on, including extension of the period of suspension from tendering for public works contracts and even removal from the List and Specialist List."
就「創新及科技基金」資助計劃的精簡及整合措施,2025-07-28 18:00,2025-07-28 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800456.htm,"創新科技署（創科署）今日（七月二十八日）宣布，將精簡並整合「創新及科技基金」（基金）下的資助計劃，以更聚焦地推進新型工業化及支持發展新質生產力。

創科署一直配合社會及經濟發展的步伐，持續優化基金，為本地創科生態的未來發展注入動力。自本屆政府於二○二二年七月上任以來，創科署已在基金下推出「產學研1+計劃」和「新型工業加速計劃」，並成立「香港微電子研發院」。同時，本屆政府亦即將推出「創科產業引導基金」、「前沿科技研究支援計劃」及「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」。

為更有效支援企業把握新型工業化帶來的機遇，透過相關資助計劃實現升級轉型，創科署將整合基金下三項推進新型工業化的資助計劃（即「新型工業化資助計劃」、「新型工業化及科技培訓計劃」，以及於今年內推出的「製造及生產線『升』級支援先導計劃」）為「新型工業化支援計劃」。在新計劃下，三項資助計劃的目的及基本運作模式將維持不變。

此外，在檢視基金下各項資助計劃的政策目標及資助對象後，創科署將會精簡並整合以下資助計劃：

（一）整合「投資研發現金回贈計劃」及「創新及科技支援計劃」：兩項資助計劃均旨在資助本地研究及發展（研發）中心、大學及其他指定公營科研機構與公司合作，進行應用研發項目，把研發成果轉移至本地業界，協助行業升級轉型，提升競爭力。鑑於兩項資助計劃的目的與資助對象大致相同，在整合措施實施後，本地公營科研機構可繼續透過「創新及科技支援計劃」與公司合作進行應用研發項目。

（二）「專利申請資助計劃」與現有資助計劃融合：「專利申請資助計劃」旨在資助從未擁有任何專利及從未接受該計劃資助的本地註冊公司和香港永久居民為其發明申請專利。鑑於基金下各項現有研發相關的資助計劃（即「創新及科技支援計劃」、「內地與香港科技合作資助計劃」，以及「企業支援計劃」）已為大學、科研機構及企業的研發項目提供專利註冊費資助，創科署認為「專利申請資助計劃」已達成在香港培育專利發展文化的目標。

上述資助計劃的資源整合、資助上限和比例的調整安排，將於二○二五年八月一日零時零分起生效，有關詳情載於附件。連同創科署先前向立法會工商及創新科技事務委員會報告的精簡措施，基金下的資助計劃數目在整合後將變為10項。

以上資助計劃的詳情載於基金網頁（www.itf.gov.hk）。如有查詢，請聯絡計劃的秘書處（電話：3655 5678；電郵：enquiry@itf.gov.hk）。"

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (July 28) Issue No. 26 of Complaints Watch, which highlights the latest banking complaint trends, emerging topical issues, and areas that Authorized Institutions (AIs) should be alert to. Complaints Watch is a semi-annual publication aimed at promoting proper standards of conduct and prudent business practices among AIs.

In the first half of 2025, the HKMA received 1,889 banking complaints, representing an increase of 33 per cent compared to the same period last year. The primary contributor to this rise was a 54 per cent increase in complaints related to the operation of banking accounts. The HKMA has reminded AIs to strengthen their communication with customers in order to minimise inconvenience. Some good practices are shared in this latest issue of the Complaints Watch (see the feature article about ""Handling complaints concerning operation of banking accounts""). This issue of Complaints Watch also contains another feature article about ""Designing banking products from the customer's perspective"".

The Complaints Watch is available on the HKMA website."
Funding schemes under Innovation and Technology Fund to be streamlined and consolidated,2025-07-28 18:00,2025-07-28 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800457.htm,"âThe Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) announced today (July28) that it would streamline and consolidate funding schemes under the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) with a view to promoting new industrialisation and supporting the development of new quality productive forces in a more focused manner.

  The ITC has been continuously enhancing the ITF to keep pace with social-economic developments and to inject impetus into the future development of the local innovation and technology ecosystem. Since the current-term Government took office in July 2022, the ITC has launched the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme and the New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme under the ITF, as well as established the Hong Kong Microelectronics Research and Development Institute. In addition, the current-term Government will soon launch the Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund, the Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme and the Pilot Manufacturing and Production Line Upgrade Support Scheme (Manufacturing+).

In order to more effectively support enterprises in seizing opportunities brought by new industrialisation to upgrade and transform through relevant funding schemes, the ITC will consolidate three funding schemes under the ITF which promote new industrialisation (namely the New Industrialisation Funding Scheme, the New Industrialisation and Technology Training Programme, and the Manufacturing+ to be launched this year) into the New Industrialisation Support Scheme. Under the new scheme, the objectives and modus operandi of the three schemes will remain unchanged.

Furthermore, after reviewing the policy objectives and beneficiaries of the various funding schemes under the ITF, the ITC will streamline and consolidate the following funding schemes:

(1) Consolidating the Research and Development Cash Rebate Scheme and the Innovation and Technology Support Programme (ITSP): Both funding schemes aim to support local research and development (R&D) centres, universities and other designated local public research institutes to collaborate with enterprises in conducting applied R&D projects with a view to transferring R&D outcomes to local industries, thereby assisting the industry to upgrade and transform, as well as to enhance its competitiveness. Given that the objectives and beneficiaries of the two funding schemes largely overlap, local public research institutes may continue to collaborate with enterprises for applied R&D projects through the ITSP after the consolidation measures take effect.

(2) Integrating the Patent Application Grant (PAG) into existing funding schemes: PAG aims to subsidise locally incorporated companies and Hong Kong permanent residents which/who have neither owned any patent nor received funding from PAG before to apply for patents for their own inventions. Given that existing R&D-related funding schemes under the ITF (namely ITSP, Mainland-Hong Kong Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme and Enterprise Support Scheme) have already been subsidising patent registration fees for R&D projects by universities, research institutions and enterprises, the ITC considers that PAG has achieved its goal of fostering a patent development culture in Hong Kong.

âThe consolidation of resources, adjustments to funding ceilings and ratios for the aforementioned funding schemes will take effect from August 1, 2025, at 0.00am. Relevant details are available in the Annex. Together with the streamlining measures previously reported by the ITC to the Panel on Commerce, Industry, Innovation and Technology of the Legislative Council, the number of funding schemes under ITF will be 10 after the consolidation.

Details of the aforementioned funding schemes are available on the ITF website (www.itf.gov.hk). For enquiries, please contact the secretariats of the schemes (tel: 3655 5678; email: enquiry@itf.gov.hk)."

Customs officers distributed promotional items to residents at the Estate and promoted to them Customs' enforcement actions against illicit cigarettes and the Government's proposal to amend the existing legislation to increase penalties for illicit cigarette-related offences, as well as provided estate security personnel with information on what to do when a suspected illicit cigarette activity is found.

If public rental housing units are found to be involved in illicit cigarette crimes, Customs will notify the HD for follow-up action after the conclusion of court proceedings. Customs reminds members of the public, especially young people, not to buy or sell illicit cigarettes or distribute illicit cigarette leaflets to avoid creating a criminal record that could affect their future.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities. Also, Customs will strengthen publicity and education to remind the public not to take part in unlawful acts related to illicit cigarettes.

Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Data Summit 2025,2025-07-28 16:40,2025-07-28 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800336.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) successfully co-organised the Data Summit 2025 today (July 28). The Summit attracted around 800 senior executives and industry professionals from almost 100 public and private organisations, including government departments, banks, data specialists and partners of Commercial Data Interchange (CDI).

Themed ""Empowering business and trade through advanced data infrastructure"", the Summit explored how data infrastructure can enhance trade finance processes and facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending, thereby fuelling trade and commerce growth. The keynote addresses and panel discussions of the Summit focused on four key areas, including Project CargoX on trade finance, open government data, SME credit insights and cross-boundary data validation. 15 CDI partner institutions also showcased cutting-edge commercial data innovations and use cases through interactive exhibition booths, fostering industry collaboration and experience sharing.

At the Summit, the HKMA presented the latest developments and future roadmap of CDI, with key highlights including:

  1. Project CargoX

The Expert Panel has welcomed new members (see Annex) to further enhance the digital ecosystem for trade finance; and




Six CargoX pilot banks (Note 1), participating in the Transport and Logistics Bureau's new trial phase of the Port Community System, have preliminarily validated the effectiveness of using cargo data to verify trade authenticity. This, in turn, helps streamline trade finance process and strengthen risk management. More innovative use cases are underway.


  2.Open government data

The HKMA, the Government's Digital Policy Office (DPO) and the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) are collaborating closely on the planned connection with the CEDB's Trade Single Window Phase 3, which is targeted for roll-out in phases in 2026, via the linkage between CDI and Consented Data Exchange Gateway. This will enable users to authorise the sharing of their import and export declaration data with participating banks, with a view to expediting loan approvals; and




The DPO's Digital Corporate Identity (CorpID) Platform is set to launch progressively from end-2026. The HKMA will explore and design the application of CorpID for electronic signing in CDI, with the aim of streamlining the corporate authorisation process.


  3.Credit insights

The HKMA is advancing a proof-of-concept (PoC) project on Commercial Credit Reference Agency (CCRA) 2.0, enabling the CCRA operator to build a corporate credit scoring model. Initial findings from the nine pilot banks (Note 2)indicate that the new model can effectively streamline the loan application process and reduce borrowing costs for SMEs.


  4.Cross-boundary data validation

CDI successfully linked with the Shenzhen-Hong Kong cross-boundary data validation platform (the platform) (Note 3)in April this year. Banks have successfully connected to the new arrangement for the purposes of processing personal and corporate loan applications.


  The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,said, ""The HKMA remains dedicated to advancing Hong Kong's data infrastructure in partnership with heavyweight strategic stakeholders in the data ecosystem. By continuously fostering data interconnectivity and unlocking the potential of both traditional and alternative data, we empower financial institutions, data providers and SME traders to benefit from streamlined and efficient processes brought by data sharing. Looking ahead, our next-generation CDI data infrastructure will continue to optimise trade finance processes, spur trade and commerce innovation, as well as support SME growth, ultimately contributing to the development of the real economy.""

  The Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan,said, ""The theme of this year's Data Summit aptly aligns with the country's strategic positioning of Hong Kong to consolidate its role as the three key centres of finance, trade, and shipping, using data as a key connector. The Transport and Logistics Bureau is developing the Port Community System in full steam to connect all stakeholders across the cargo shipment process and integrate sea, land, and air transport data to materialise full transparency of cargo status. We will continue to support the industry in leveraging the system to explore more use cases for financing, further facilitating cargo, trade and capital flows.""

  The Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam,said, ""Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is the world's number one cargo airport, a position we have held 14th times since 2010. To further enhance our competitiveness, we must continue to leverage the power of technology, and digitalisation of the air cargo supply chain is one of the key steps to achieve greater efficiency and enable value-added services. The Airport Authority's HKIA Cargo Data Platform, anchored on advanced technologies such as blockchain and smart contract, provides a trusted, intelligent platform that facilitates secured, seamless and paperless information exchange, efficient cargo process and innovative business solutions. Leveraging our platform's cargo data and in collaboration with the HKMA's CDI, we are able to facilitate SMEs' financing process and enhance credit risk management. We welcome continuous development in this area and anticipate further opportunities for collaboration with the HKMA and other business partners to develop Hong Kong into the region's leading e-commence fulfillment centre.""

  The Chairperson of the HKAB, Ms Mary Huen,said, ""As Hong Kong undergoes economic restructuring, the banking industry is committed to providing SMEs with flexible and convenient financing to support their upgrading and transformation so as to remain competitive. The HKAB encourages its member banks to actively participate in the latest CDI-related initiatives led by the HKMA, including the PoC studies of Project CargoX and CCRA 2.0 as well as cross-boundary data validation pilot. The initiatives will streamline loan approval processes and improve credit risk management by leveraging government and industry data. We look forward to collaborating further with the HKMA and the relevant government departments to enhance the digital ecosystem of trade finance, with the objective of jointly strengthening our support to SMEs and promoting Hong Kong's economic development.""

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-07-28 16:30,2025-07-28 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800445.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (July 28) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From July 20 to 26, the CHP recorded five community-acquired LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


An 88-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Kwai Tsing District;
A 61-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Sha Tin District;
A 60-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Sha Tin District;
A 68-year-old male patient with good past health living in Kwai Tsing District; and
An 81-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Yau Tsim Mong District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that all five cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of July 26, 90 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

  A Government spokesman said that merchandise exports performance remained resilient in June. The value of merchandise exports grew noticeably further by 11.9% over a year earlier. Exports to the Mainland and most other Asian markets continued to expand visibly, while those to the United States and the European Union fell.

  Looking ahead, the sustained steady growth in various Asian economies in particular the Mainland economy, as well as Hong Kong's enhanced economic and trade ties with different markets, should continue to support merchandise trade performance. Nonetheless, the outlook of global trade policy is still uncertain. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and stay vigilant.

Number of service points for Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme in Guangzhou increases to four,2025-07-28 16:03,2025-07-28 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800266.htm,"The Government announced today (July 28) that the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (GPHCM) in Guangzhou will accept eligible Hong Kong elderly persons to use Elderly Health Care Vouchers (EHCVs) to pay for outpatient healthcare services at designated departments starting from July 31.

""The GPHCM is the fourth service point in Guangzhou and the second Chinese medicine hospital under the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme (Pilot Scheme), providing eligible elderly persons with additional choices in healthcare services. In January 2024, the GPHCM and the Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong signed a Strategic Collaboration Agreement to promote talent exchange and scientific research collaboration, etc. The GPHCM has been an invaluable partner to Hong Kong in promoting the high-quality development of Chinese medicine,"" said a Government spokesman. With this additional service point, the number of service points in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) Mainland cities where EHCVs can be used will increase to 16, benefitting more than 1.78 million eligible Hong Kong elderly persons. Apart from the GPHCM, the other three service points in Guangzhou are The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University; Nansha Division of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, and Guangdong Clifford Hospital.

At the GPHCM, EHCVs are applicable for outpatient healthcare services provided by 10 designated departments, namely the Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Surgery, Department of Ophthalmology, Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck, Department of Stomatology, Department of Orthopedics, Department of Gynecology, Department of Dermatology, Department of Breast, and Department of Acupuncture.

The arrangements for shared use of EHCVs between spouses and the EHCV Pilot Reward Scheme under the EHCV Scheme are equally applicable to the GPHCM. When an elderly person receives designated primary healthcare outpatient services for health checks, preventive health services, and follow-up/monitoring of long-term conditions at the designated departments, the EHCV spending for that service encounter can be accumulated for the allotment of rewards. Further information and patient visit procedures are set out in the Annex.

The fees for the healthcare services provided by the pilot medical institutions are denominated in Renminbi. Medical institutions will make EHCV claims for elderly persons, and the EHCV amount deducted in Hong Kong dollars will be calculated according to a monthly updated voucher conversion factor under the EHCV Scheme. The monthly voucher conversion factor under the EHCV Scheme will be displayed at the cashier offices of the medical institutions for reference by the elderly persons.

""Elderly persons cannot use EHCVs together with national medical insurance to pay for the fees of the same healthcare service encounter. The scope of using EHCVs on the Mainland is the same as that in Hong Kong, which does not include inpatient services, prepaid healthcare services and day surgery procedures. EHCVs cannot be used solely for the purchase of goods, medication, medical equipment or products, nor can they be redeemed for cash,"" the spokesman reminded.

Hong Kong elderly persons should register with eHealth before using EHCVs at any designated service point in the GBA. To facilitate Hong Kong citizens in using electronic health records (eHRs) across the boundary in a secure manner and to enhance the continuity of healthcare services, the ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" and ""Personal Folder"" functions of the eHealth mobile application (eHealth App) will be extended to the GPHCM starting from the service launch day of the Pilot Scheme (i.e. July 31). In addition, elderly persons can also use the eHealth App to check their EHCV balance and usage record, as well as access at any time important information such as their medications, allergies and adverse drug reactions stored in the eHealth App. If elderly persons wish to use EHCVs at the GBA medical institutions but have not yet registered with eHealth, the medical institutions will instantly register them for eHealth upon their consent so that they can use EHCVs right away.

If elderly persons suspect that the participating medical institutions have violated the EHCV Scheme rules, they can call the EHCV Scheme hotline (2838 2311) to provide relevant information and details to the Health Care Voucher Division of the Department of Health (DH). All suspected cases of violation of the EHCV Scheme rules will be strictly dealt with by the DH. Furthermore, each participating GBA medical institution has set up an enquiry and complaint hotline. Elderly persons can also offer their views to the relevant medical institution or file complaints against the medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme to the health authority at the provincial or city level if necessary. Members of the public can visit the following thematic website (www.hcv.gov.hk/en/hcv_gba_pilot_scheme/index.html) for more information.

The Government is actively taking forward the implementation of the Pilot Scheme in the remaining five medical institutions included in the Pilot Scheme. It is expected that the relevant arrangements will be launched gradually in the second half of this year. Together with the two service points operated by the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, eligible elderly persons can use EHCVs at a total of 21 service points in the GBA Mainland cities."
「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」在廣州市服務點增至四個,2025-07-28 16:00,2025-07-28 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800264.htm,"政府今日（七月二十八日）公布，位於廣州市的廣東省中醫院將於七月三十一日起接受合資格香港長者使用長者醫療券（醫療券）支付指定科室的門診醫療護理服務費用。

政府發言人表示：「廣東省中醫院是『長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃』（『試點計劃』）下廣州市內第四個服務點，亦是第二間開展服務的中醫院，為合資格長者提供更多醫療服務選擇。該院於二○二四年一月與香港中醫醫院簽署戰略合作協議，以促進人才交流及科研協作等，一直是香港推動中醫藥高質量發展的重要合作夥伴。」計及這個新增的服務點，大灣區內地城市可以使用醫療券的服務點將增至16個，讓超過178萬名合資格的香港長者受惠。除了廣東省中醫院外，廣州市另外三個服務點為－－中山大學附屬第一醫院、中山大學附屬第一醫院南沙院區，及廣東祈福醫院。

在廣東省中醫院，醫療券將適用於其10個指定科室的門診醫療護理服務，包括內科、外科、眼科、耳鼻咽喉頭頸科、口腔科、骨科、婦科、皮膚科、乳腺科及針推康復。

醫療券計劃下的配偶共用醫療券安排和「長者醫療券獎賞先導計劃」同樣適用於廣東省中醫院。長者使用醫療券在指定科室接受健康檢查、預防疾病、跟進／監測慢性疾病門診服務等特定基層醫療服務，該次服務所使用的醫療券金額可累積計算以賺取獎賞。更多的資料及就醫流程列於附件。

試點醫療機構的醫療服務收費以人民幣結算。醫療機構會為長者申報使用醫療券，並按醫療券計劃下每月更新的換算率計算需扣除的港元醫療券金額。醫療機構會於收費處標示計劃下每月的指明換算率，供長者參考。

發言人提醒：「長者不可同時使用醫療券和國家醫療保險支付同一次醫療服務的費用。在內地使用醫療券的適用範圍跟在香港一樣，不包括住院服務、須預先繳費的醫療服務及日間手術程序。醫療券亦不可用於單純購買物品、藥物、醫療儀器和用品，更不可兌換現金。」

香港長者在任何一個大灣區服務點使用醫療券，均須先登記加入醫健通。醫健通流動應用程式中的「跨境健康紀錄」及「個人資料夾」功能，亦將於「試點計劃」服務開展當日（七月三十一日）起擴展至廣東省中醫院，便利香港市民安全地跨境使用電子健康紀錄，以獲取更連貫的護理服務。此外，長者亦可利用醫健通流動應用程式查閱醫療券餘額和使用紀錄，以及隨時取覽儲存至醫健通的個人藥物紀錄、敏感及藥物不良反應等重要資料。如長者欲於大灣區的指定醫療機構使用醫療券，但尚未加入醫健通，醫療機構在取得長者同意後，會即時為長者登記醫健通，以便長者可隨即使用醫療券。

長者如懷疑參與計劃的醫療機構違反醫療券計劃的規定，可致電醫療券計劃熱線（2838 2311）向衞生署醫療券事務科提供相關資料及詳情。衞生署會嚴肅跟進所有懷疑違反醫療券計劃規定的個案。此外，每間大灣區試點醫療機構均設有查詢或投訴熱線。長者亦可向相關醫療機構提出意見，或在有需要時向省或市級衞生當局就「試點計劃」醫療機構作出投訴。市民可參閱以下專題網頁了解更多資料（www.hcv.gov.hk/tc/hcv_gba_pilot_scheme/index.html）。

政府正積極與餘下五間獲納入「試點計劃」的醫療機構推進準備工作，預計相關的醫療機構可於今年下半年內陸續開展相關安排，連同香港大學深圳醫院的一院兩點，合資格長者可以在大灣區內地城市合共21個服務點使用醫療券。"

Dr Hu dedicated himself to the university and served as its President until his passing, commanding the respect and love of the university's staff, students and alumni. Dr Hu devoted substantial financial resources and personal effort to the development of Hong Kong's post-secondary education, nurturing generations of virtuous talent for Hong Kong.

多謝主席、各位委員。

建設低碳綠色宜居的城市是世界大趨勢，國家二十大報告也表明要堅持「綠水青山就是金山銀山」的理念，推動綠色發展，所以香港特區也應該朝着建設低碳綠色宜居社區的方向來規劃發展，以滿足未來社會、環境及經濟的需要和期望。

我們認為一個低碳綠色宜居的社區需要最少具備智慧、綠色及具抗禦力等三個元素，透過穩健的城市規劃、創新及科技應用、明智運用資源、有生命力的企業，以及綠色低碳生活文化，達致人與自然和諧共生的可持續社區。

政府在過去已就規劃低碳綠色宜居社區累積了豐富的經驗，例如在洪水橋／厦村新發展區在城市規劃、城市設計和綠色基建等各方面引入了可持續發展及以人為本的策略，以提高效率、節約能源、增加廢物循環再用和綠化面積，以及減少碳排放。

總結以往經驗，環境及生態局聯同發展局正計劃制訂《規劃新發展區的通用綠色框架》，為政策局及部門就規劃新發展區時提供指引。本文件旨在介紹政府就制訂《綠色框架》的初步構想，並徵詢委員的意見，以集思廣益，再為《綠色框架》作草擬及定稿。

接下來我請同事簡介文件的內容。"

Given the sudden change of events and the absence of the Deputy Financial Secretary from Hong Kong, the Government has decided that the post of Secretary for Housing will be taken up by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, MrCheuk Wing-hing, for those three days.

To enhance governance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, the current-term Government created three Deputy Secretaries of Departments to strengthen co-ordination of work across bureaux. The acting arrangement fully demonstrates the positive role of the Deputy Secretaries of Departments in facilitating the Government's effective operation, reflecting the current-term Government's philosophy of improving governance through systematic enhancements, as well as the flexibility and team spirit of Principal Officials in making concerted efforts with one another."

醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（七月二十八日）表示：「雙軌發展途徑是突破香港公共醫療機構及醫學院既有聘用安排的新措施，為從事醫教研工作的複合型專才提供更適切的專業發展途徑，度身訂造與其工作性質相稱的聘任和臨床工作安排，以及晉升階梯。同時，亦為他們的教研工作提供更多支援，包括授予大學教授頭銜。有關安排體現了醫管局和本地兩所醫學院為培訓及挽留醫教研人才攜手合作，突破制度的條框。」

「醫生的臨床工作與教學和研究密不可分。臨床工作所提供的數據和經驗是醫學研究的重要基礎，而最新的研究成果應用於臨床實踐亦可進一步提升臨床服務的質與量，兩者相輔相成。我期望雙軌發展途徑能讓更多有志參與醫教研工作的醫生實現抱負，在為病患提供臨床服務的同時，亦為香港醫療研究和創新貢獻力量。」

Under this pathway, doctors aspiring to engage in medical, teaching and research work would hold positions at both the HA and the designated university, and could flexibly allocate their time between clinical services, teaching and research work as needed.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said today (July 28), ""The dual-track development pathway is a new initiative that goes beyond the existing employment arrangements in Hong Kong's public healthcare institutions and medical schools. It provides a more fitting professional development pathway for composite talent engaged in medical, teaching and research work, with tailor-made appointment and clinical work arrangements and a promotion ladder commensurate with the nature of their work. It also provides stronger support for their teaching and research duties, including conferring the title of university professor. This arrangement signifies a breakthrough of institutional framework through collaboration between the HA and the two local medical schools to train and retain medical, teaching and research talent.

  ""A doctor's clinical work is inextricably linked with teaching and research. The data and experience from clinical work are an important foundation for medical research, while the clinical application of the latest research results can further enhance the quality and quantity of clinical services. The two are complementary. I hope that the dual-track development pathway will enable more doctors who aspire to engage in medical, teaching and research work to realise their ambitions and contribute to Hong Kong's medical innovation and research while providing clinical services to patients.""

  He continued, ""The establishment of a dual-track development pathway creates a more favourable environment for nurturing clinical, teaching and research talent. This complements the various reforms within our healthcare system put forward by the HHB in recent years, including preparing for the establishment of the 'Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation', setting up the 'Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute', promoting clinical trials, and planning for the establishment of a third medical school. All these initiatives will consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub. I also hope this new measure will attract more non-locally trained doctors who are interested in clinical research and innovation to come to Hong Kong, to further strengthen the medical talent pool for the benefit of the public.""

  The HA and the two medical schools have started the relevant recruitment work progressively. To date, five doctors have been officially selected to participate in the dual-track development pathway. Among them, four doctors from the Hong Kong Children's Hospital were appointed by the medical school of HKU, focusing on the research and treatment of various diseases covering paediatric malignant tumours, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, neonatal intensive care, differences in sex development in children, sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular disease in the young, paediatric hematology and oncology, and the development of simulation-based learning and skills training. Another doctor from the Department of Intensive Care of the New Territories East Cluster was appointed by the medical school of CUHK, focusing on the diagnosis, treatment, research and professional training in pain management and intensive care. Furthermore, various doctors from the New Territories East Cluster are expected to join the medical school of CUHK through the dual-track development pathway within this year, further expanding the talent pool for the integration of teaching and clinical work."

響應「世界肝炎日」　乙肝「早驗早處理」,2025-07-28 12:10,2025-07-28 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800298.htm,"衞生署今日（七月二十八日）表示，經過政府三十多年來的推動和努力，香港乙型肝炎（乙肝）感染率已大幅降低，並逐步邁向「無乙肝新一代」的目標。

每年七月二十八日為「世界肝炎日」，衞生署今年特別以「廿分之一係咪你乙肝早驗早處理」為口號，提醒市民若不確定是否患有慢性乙型肝炎，應及早進行測試。早發現、早治療可有效減低乙肝所引發的嚴重肝臟疾病的風險。

衞生署衞生防護中心公共衞生服務處特別預防計劃顧問醫生黃駿君醫生表示：「香港於七○年代的乙肝感染率高逾10%，自八○年代起，政府採取多項有效免費預防措施，包括為所有孕婦進行乙肝篩查、為患有乙肝的孕婦所生的嬰兒注射乙肝免疫球蛋白、自一九八八年起為所有新生嬰兒接種乙肝疫苗、近年增設向患有乙肝且病毒量高的孕婦提供抗病毒藥物，以及為母親是乙肝患者的嬰兒在接種乙肝疫苗後安排血清測試。現時，35歲以下年齡組別的乙肝感染率已少於1%，香港正邁向『無乙肝新一代』的目標。」

乙型肝炎可分急性或慢性，嚴重情況會引發肝衰竭、肝硬化或肝癌。衞生署根據2020-22年度人口健康調查的結果推算，全港整體人口仍有約5.6%（即約41萬人）患有慢性乙肝。調查發現35至84歲人士的乙肝感染率明顯較高，達7.8%，主要原因是於一九八八年前出生，未受惠於普及兒童乙肝疫苗接種計劃。調查亦發現，近四成患者沒有察覺自己患有慢性乙肝，並有約七成患者沒有接受任何跟進治療。慢性乙肝是一種終身感染，可以潛藏數以十年也不引起任何症狀，若沒有接受治療，約15%至40%的患者長遠會出現肝硬化和肝癌等嚴重肝臟疾病。肝癌是本港第三位致命癌症，每年約1 400人死於肝癌；而約八成肝癌新症患者患有慢性乙肝。

衞生署藉「世界肝炎日」呼籲所有香港市民關注慢性乙肝這個可以導致肝硬化及肝癌的「幕後黑手」。市民如不確定是否乙肝患者，特別是較高感染風險人士，例如不曾接種疫苗者、家庭成員（如父母、兄弟姊妹及子女）或性伴侶為慢性乙肝患者等，應及早進行測試，了解自己的身體狀況，並採取適切預防措施，包括接種乙肝疫苗。

乙肝測試除透過傳統靜脈抽血化驗外，現時亦可透過指尖採血快速測試，於15至30分鐘內獲得結果。乙肝測試於不同醫療機構均有提供，個別機構更設有流動檢測服務。市民如欲進行乙肝測試，可諮詢家庭醫生了解詳情及收費。

如確診患有慢性乙肝，應諮詢醫生的建議並定期接受跟進和檢查，以實踐「早驗早處理」。現今治療乙肝的抗病毒藥物能有效抑制病毒的複製，大大減低患者出現肝硬化和肝癌等併發症的風險。

另外，二○二四年《施政報告》提出在社區推行以風險為本的乙肝篩查，及早識別在社區的患者，並提供持續管理。基層醫療署正研究相關安排，詳情將適時公布。此外，政府今年內將公布《2025-2030年香港病毒性肝炎行動計劃》，制訂措施以進一步減輕病毒性肝炎的公共衞生負擔。

為加強公眾及醫護人員對肝炎風險的認知，衞生署和社區夥伴分別推出多項宣傳活動，以期將信息滲透不同人口群組，包括：

透過多元渠道宣傳健康資訊，例如報章專欄、電台訪談及社交媒體等；
於地區康健中心舉辦線上及實體健康講座；
於全港多區舉行流動健康推廣展覽；以及
由非政府組織（包括亞洲肝炎會、香港乙肝基金會、香港肝壽基金及香港肝臟移植協康會等）舉辦社區公眾教育活動，向市民講解乙型肝炎防治知識，提供快速測試及風險評估等服務。

DH appeals for early testing and management of hepatitis B in support of World Hepatitis Day,2025-07-28 12:10,2025-07-28 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800288.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (July 28) said that with the Government's promulgation and efforts over the past three decades, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Hong Kong has been significantly reduced and is moving progressively towards the goal of a ""hepatitis B-free generation"".

World Hepatitis Day is designated on July 28 every year. This year, the DH has adopted the slogan ""1 in 20: Test and Manage Hep B Early"" to remind members of the public to undergo testing early if they are uncertain whether they are having chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Early identification and management can effectively lower the risk of serious liver diseases caused by CHB.

  ""The prevalence of HBV infection in Hong Kong was over 10 per cent in the 1970s. Since the 1980s, the Government has implemented various effective and free preventive measures, including universal antenatal screening for hepatitis B, administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin for babies born to mothers with hepatitis B, universal neonatal hepatitis B vaccination since 1988, use of antivirals for pregnant women with CHB and high viral load, and post-vaccination serologic testing arranged for babies born to mothers with hepatitis B in recent years. Currently, the prevalence of HBV infection is less than 1 per cent among those under 35 years old. Hong Kong is moving towards the goal of a 'hepatitis B-free generation'"", said the Consultant (Special Preventive Programme) of the Public Health Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Bonnie Wong.

Hepatitis B infection can be acute or chronic. Severe cases of hepatitis B infection can lead to liver failure, cirrhosis or liver cancer. As derived from the findings of the Population Health Survey (PHS) 2020-22 conducted by the DH, about 5.6 per cent (about 410 000 people) of the Hong Kong population have CHB. The survey found that the prevalence of HBV infection among participants aged 35 to 84 was significantly higher at 7.8 per cent, mainly because those born before 1988 had not benefited from the universal childhood hepatitis B immunisation programme. The survey also found that nearly 40 per cent of people with CHB were not aware of their conditions and about 70 per cent of people with CHB did not receive any medical follow-up. CHB is a lifelong infection that often shows no symptoms for decades. Without treatment, about 15 to 40 per cent of the patients with CHB may develop serious liver diseases like cirrhosis or liver cancer in the long run. Liver cancer is Hong Kong's third leading cause of cancer deaths, which claimed around 1 400 lives every year. About 80 per cent of primary liver cancer patients have CHB.

The DH, in support of World Hepatitis Day, urges members of the public in Hong Kong to pay attention to CHB, which is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. People who are not sure whether they have CHB, especially those at higher risk of infection, such as those who have not received vaccination, or whose family members (including parents, siblings and offspring) or sexual partners have CHB, are advised to undergo early testing to review their health condition and take appropriate preventive measures, including receiving hepatitis B vaccination.

Apart from the traditional venous blood sampling, rapid test for hepatitis B using blood drop from a finger-prick is also available and the result will be available in 15 to 30 minutes. Hepatitis B testing is available at different healthcare organisations, and some even offer mobile testing services. Members of the public may consult their family doctors for details and the charges if they wish to have hepatitis B testing.

If you are diagnosed with CHB, in line with the principle of ""test and manage early"", you should consult your doctor for advice and receive regular follow-ups and examinations. Current antiviral medications for hepatitis B can inhibit virus replication effectively and thereby greatly reduce the risk of complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Separately, the 2024 Policy Address announced a risk-based hepatitis B screening in the community for early identification of people with CHB in the community, and to provide subsequent management. The Primary Healthcare Commission is exploring the relevant arrangement and details will be announced in due course. In addition, the Government will announce the Hong Kong Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2025-2030 within this year, to promulgate measures to further alleviate the public health burden of viral hepatitis.

To raise the public and healthcare workers' awareness of the risk of hepatitis, the DH and community partners have respectively launched a number of publicity campaigns to disseminate the messages to different population groups, including:

promoting health information through multiple channels, such as newspaper columns, radio interviews and social media;
organising online and physical health seminars in District Health Centres;
organising roving exhibitions on health promotions in various districts across the territory; and
organising community public education activities by non-governmental organisations (including Asiahep Hong Kong Limited, Hong Kong Hepatitis B Free Foundation, the Hong Kong Liver Foundation and the Hong Kong Liver Transplant Patients' Association) to educate the public on the prevention of hepatitis B, and provide services such as rapid testing and risk assessment.

  The TD has approved the taxi livery design and markings of the four fleets. For easy identification by passengers, all fleet taxis are required to display fleet taxi plates at the front and rear of the taxi bodies, and a fleet taxi certificate on the windscreens of the taxis.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""All fleets provide online hailing services. Passengers can book their journeys through the fleets' mobile applications or other online hailing channels. Fleets also provide customer service hotlines to handle passengers' enquiries and complaints. Further, all fleet taxis provide multiple electronic payment means, while safety devices including dash cameras, in-vehicle cameras and global navigation satellite systems as well as the driver monitoring system have been installed to provide convenience for passengers and ensure driving safety.""

  Fleet taxis may customise fares for pre-arranged journeys, charging a booking fee on top of the metered fare or charging a lump sum fare before the journey starts. Both must be agreed upon with the hirer in advance. The fares of fleet taxis may vary for pre-arranged journeys depending on the circumstances at the time of booking and the types of taxis requested by the passenger. For example, higher fares may be charged during peak hours or when the passenger requests a premium taxi. For street-hailing trips, fleet taxis shall charge according to the same fare schedule as general taxis.

  The TD has set up a taxi fleet thematic website. It also introduces information about the taxi fleet service to the public and tourists through various online and offline channels, including the TD's HKeMobility mobile application, and collaboration with the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal operator and Hong Kong Talent Engage.

  In addition, the TD has set up about 80 designated fleet taxi stopping places across 13 locations, such as the airport, certain boundary control points, the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, some Airport Express stations, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal and Hong Kong Disneyland. Information plates have been installed at these locations. The TD has also put up signage and display panels at some of these locations, and displayed online hailing QR codes via leaflets and posters for the public and tourists to make their bookings."

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-28 11:30,2025-07-28 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800283.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-28 06:45,2025-07-28 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800013.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 28) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；

The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) has the following statement today (July 27) regarding an industrial accident at Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) redevelopment project construction site:

The site management of the contractor immediately called Fire Services Department to rescue the worker, who was then sent to the Accident and Emergency Department of QMH for emergency treatment. The worker was certified dead upon arrival at the Accident and Emergency Department.

The HA expresses deep sorrow over this incident and extends its sincere condolences to the deceased worker's family. The HA has directed the ArchSD to ensure that the contractor provides appropriate assistance to the family and supports them in handling the family member's after-death arrangements.

The HA is very concerned about the incident. Since the lifts involved in the project have not yet undergone all required works and adjustments, and have not been handed over for use and management by QMH. The HA is aware that site staff from the ArchSD immediately contacted and followed up with the contractor after the accident. The contractor has been urged to take the incident seriously and to adopt all necessary measures as soon as possible to ensure site safety. The contractor has also been requested to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report to the ArchSD and the HA as soon as possible to prevent similar accidents from happening again.
