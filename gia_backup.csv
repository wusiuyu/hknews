Committee Members of the Tsinforn C. Wong Memorial Scholarship, distinguished guests, alumni, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is my honour and great pleasure to join you all tonight at the ""Stars of Tomorrow 2025 – When Dreams Come True"" Gala Opening, celebrating the 65th Anniversary of the esteemed Jean M. Wong School of Ballet. My warmest congratulations to the School on this remarkable milestone.

  ""Stars of Tomorrow"" has long been a platform showcasing the brilliance of elite young ballet dancers. This year, the performance is centred on the remarkable journey of the School Principal, Ms Wong. It is a fitting tribute to both this landmark anniversary and to Ms Wong's unparalleled contributions to the world of ballet in Hong Kong. I am confident that students from both the Jean M. Wong School of Ballet and the Hong Kong International Summer Dance School 2025 will unleash their potential to present a captivating and inspiring production. With every gravity-defying jeté and every precise spin, we witness not just technical mastery, but also the strong passion of these budding talents.

Tonight's celebration, however, would not be possible without the unwavering efforts of those who have nurtured these rising stars. Among them, we must extend our deepest gratitude to Ms Wong, a true pioneer and pillar of ballet education, who founded the very first ballet school in Hong Kong run by a Chinese-speaking native.

For more than six decades, Ms Wong has been a luminous beacon, guiding generations of dancers and choreographers in her school. She has not only finessed their skills on stage but also instilled in them the values intrinsic to ballet — discipline, perseverance, and an unrelenting will to excel, equipping her students with this precious asset to thrive in all their endeavours in life. Her profound impact on the local art scenes have rightfully earned her widespread acclaim.

As we mark this significant milestone of the School, we must also acknowledge the vital role played by The Tsinforn C. Wong Memorial Scholarship, established by Ms Wong in honour of her dear father. The scholarship empowered aspiring dancers and choreographers to pursue their dreams, ensuring that talent and passion are not hindered by financial constraints. I encourage all scholarship recipients to embrace the spirit of this scholarship, and pass on the essence of ballet to those around you for many more years to come.

In closing, my heartfelt congratulations once more to the Jean M. Wong School of Ballet on 65 years of artistic excellence. May Ms Wong's story inspire all of us to chase our dreams with courage and determination. Thank you."

A man was arrested yesterday (August 15).

Customs on August 11 inspected a seaborne consignment, declared as sandals, arriving in Hong Kong from Thailand at the Kwai Chung Customhouse. Upon inspection, Customs officers found the batch of suspected heroin concealed in the heels of a batch of sandals.

Customs officers subsequently mounted a controlled delivery operation yesterday and arrested a 62-year-old man suspected to be connected with the case in Cheung Sha Wan.

An investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people, nor to release their personal data or home address to others for receiving parcels or goods.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-16 17:30,2025-08-16 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600550.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月十六日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心提醒市民應採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後。若出現發燒或急性關節痛等病徵，應立即就醫並通知醫生相關旅遊史，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。

本港今年累計錄得九宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，目前，市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證的快速測試產品，供市民自行測試基孔肯雅熱。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。市民亦不應自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

他補充，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食物環境衞生署（食環署）呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-16 17:30,2025-08-16 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600549.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 16), no new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures, especially upon returning to Hong Kong from regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Individuals experiencing symptoms such as fever or acute joint pain should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors of their travel history. Do not attempt self-testing, as this may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of nine confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminded members of the public that currently, there are no rapid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for public use in self-testing for CF. People should promptly seek medical advice if they suspect they are infected with CF and should not conduct testing on their own as this may delay proper clinical treatment. He also urged the public not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example, increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication.

He also added that members of the public should adopt precautions during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 andpicaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âIn addition, the FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
勞工及福利局局長就高端人才入境計劃會見傳媒談話內容,2025-08-16 14:22,2025-08-16 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600426.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（八月十六日）上午出席電視台節目訪問後，就高端人才通行證計劃會見傳媒的談話內容：

勞工及福利局局長：早晨各位，看看大家有甚麼問題。

記者：局長，對於有學者指出對高端人才通行證計劃（高才通）的續簽率不太滿意，請問政府對此續簽率是否滿意？有社會聲音認為續簽率較低，請問如何回應？另外，前特首梁振英在社交媒體指政府的考慮不夠長遠，未來七年後人才有機會取得香港永久居民身分，政府有否預計該等人口的數量？梁振英亦指出，其後他們在內地所生的子女亦可獲得香港永久居民身分，政府有否預計未來申請人口對本港醫療、教育和福利的影響？

勞工及福利局局長：首先，昨天我們公布了首批高才通續簽的數字。截至今年七月三十一日，首批一萬三千多宗已經到期的高才通簽證，其續簽率是54%。我們認為是理想的，亦符合預期。高才通推出之初，我們亦講得非常清楚，高才通並非以工作為本，而是以人才為本，讓人才先來港探索機會。若人才認為環境良好、合適，便會選擇留下來，是一個相互選擇的過程。這個既是對香港的一個考驗，對人才而言亦是一個考驗。就54%的申請續簽比率而言，我們覺得是理想的。我們可用英國的類似計劃作參考，他們稱它為Graduate Visa，讓於英國畢業的海外學生留在英國工作。他們的申請續簽率約是46%。事實上，香港的續簽率是稍勝於英國，我們認為這個是相當好的。

另外，在這54%申請續簽的高才中，質素可是相當高的，包括他們的收入或是工作範疇，即是我們最需要的創科、金融、商貿。此外，他們大部分很年輕，50%以上是低於40歲。香港正面對人口老化，我們的勞動人口已經過了高峰。若大家想作參考，本港每年踏入65歲的人口約12萬，同時每年踏入22歲的人口約六萬。一個是踏入「老友記」的年齡，另一個則是踏入大學畢業後適合加入社會工作的年齡。意思是，若我們甚麼都不做，我們每年淨損失的勞動人口是六萬。多了12萬名長者，但只有六萬名年輕人出來工作，我們會損失了六萬勞動人口。所以，如果香港不下工夫，我們的勞動人口會進一步縮減。我們需要針對性地引進可以幫助香港發展的人才。我們有兩個方向，一個是以有工作為本，這是從前專才計劃一直沿用的，人才獲聘後才可來港；另一方面，我們很想讓一些人才來香港探索，即使人才來港後未有工作，基於他自身能力和強大的人際網絡，他或許未必從事一份現成的工作，反之可能會創造新的工種、甚或開創一間全新的公司。過去兩年我們看到這情況在高才通當中是越來越多。我覺得這個是對香港好的。

另外大家會關心，他拿了高才通身分，是不是就成為香港永久居民──並不是這樣的。高才通首兩年的簽證，僅僅是給他一個機會去探索。他要成為香港永久居民，還要再經過兩關。他要經歷兩次的續簽，要有工作或自己成立了有具體業務的公司，才可以通過獲得兩次續簽。因此，他們並非取得高才通第一個簽證後，便等於成為香港永久居民。事實上，他們每位都具備實力，是其他很多城市給予房屋及金錢去爭奪的人才，並不會貿然為了來港而做出他認為對他沒有好處的事。我們看到，會攜帶子女來港的高才，均是有信心和把握獲得續簽，才願意讓子女來港讀書。大家都要將心比己，他在原居地有好學校、讀得很好，貿然來港兩年後，若主申請人未能成功續簽，受養人簽證亦會過期，小朋友便要離開回到原居地，原有的學校是否重新收生亦是未知。我覺得大家都要想想他的安排。我們現在看到的是，會帶小朋友來港讀書的高才都是很有信心，有工作讓他能夠成功續簽，他才來港。

當然長遠而言，香港是不夠年輕人，我們不夠學生。所以，無論他是用高才、專才，或是透過其他種種計劃來港，過去現在都是相同，我們都歡迎他來港。關鍵點是，他要跟從香港的規矩，依法循規。若他來港成為香港一分子，我們應當歡迎，香港一直是個多元開放的城市。我知道大家很關心這課題，所以在高才續簽方面，我們都做得相當仔細，都是一步一步跟進。本地人是一個大基礎盤，在本地人人口基數不足之際──尤其是年輕人口少的時候──我們能通過人才計劃，為我們的經濟發展注入更多動力。

記者：最近留意到，現階段的資助大學入學學額競爭很大，而跟進行家剛剛問到的問題，政府有否預視未來七年後，若本港多了一些高才真正成為永久性居民，在資源方面可以如何支撐未來人口的需求，尤其現時已看到競爭已經開始增大？

勞工及福利局局長：統計署已於前天發表最新中期人口數字，我們看到人口有輕微增長。此增長只是輕微的，正如我之前所說，撇除外來人口，香港每一年死亡人數比出生人數多。若我們如果甚麼都不做，我們人口是會縮少的。正如我所說，每年踏入65歲的人口有約12萬；而踏入22歲的人口則是一半，只有六萬。所以，每年我們淨減六萬勞動力比較強的的勞動人口。而隨着引入人才和其他計劃，人才來港補充了我們的勞動力。我明白大家對於社會的運作都有不同的看法，但希望大家公道地去看，我們每一項制度，無論是教育或種種的社會服務，都是有規有矩的。而且，我們不只是針對高才子女，我們亦安排很多循不同計劃從歐美地區來的人才，我們都一樣為他們提供公平、一致的安排。只要他是跟從香港的規矩，並通過努力實現到自己升學的理想，我覺得大家應該擁有一個公平的跑道。此外，現在香港的教育資源投放其實很大，有很多不同的選擇，讓我們的年輕人可以實現自己的理想。我們會持續關注人才計劃下的大家關心的事項，並進一步去跟進。這次是第一次我們完成續簽並和大家分享數據。將來若有更多數據，我們亦會跟大家分享。

Partial termination of a contract for bottled drinking water for government offices,2025-08-16 13:53,2025-08-16 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600398.htm,"The Government Logistics Department (GLD) stated that it had partially terminated a contract for the supply of bottled drinking water to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands starting from today (August 16).

In June this year, the GLD awarded the contract to Xin Ding Xin Trade Co., Limited (XDX). According to the contract, XDX is to supply bottled drinking water, branded ""XinLe"" and manufactured by æ¨ç¾æ°ï¼å»£æ±ï¼é£²ç¨æ°´æéå¬å¸å»£å·åå¬å¸ (available in Chinese only), to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands starting from late June this year for a period of 36 months.

Having received information on XDX's business operation recently, the GLD was not satisfied that XDX would still be capable of performing the contract, and decided to partially terminate the said contract starting from today (August 16) in accordance with contract terms. The GLD will follow up seriously and take follow-up action including whether to terminate the contract. The GLD has also referred the case to Police for investigation.

To ensure the supply of drinking water, the GLD has arranged for AS Watson Group (HK) Limited to supply bottled drinking water temporarily, branded ""COOL"" and manufactured by the company, to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands starting from next week.

The GLD has been monitoring contractual performance of the suppliers of bottled drinking water for government offices, with a view to ensuring stable supply of bottled drinking water in compliance with stipulated technical specifications according to contract terms and ensuring the safety of drinking water. Suppliers are required to submit test reports issued by independent accredited laboratories every two months to prove that the drinking water provided by them complies with the requirements under the technical specifications. The GLD also extracts samples of drinking water for testing from time to time throughout the contract period. In this regard, the GLD has earlier conducted a test of bottled drinking water samples in government offices, which confirmed that the bottled drinking water from all suppliers complied with the safety standards for bottled drinking water.

Following the expiry of the original contracts, the GLD conducted an open tender in March this year to select suitable suppliers of bottled drinking water for government departments. As regards the three successful tenderers and the brands of drinking water to be supplied pursuant to their tenders, the information is set out as follows:

Reporter: Can you comment on the fatal accident at the MTR depot yesterday? Do you view this as an isolated incident or do you believe it warrants a broader examination of MTR's safety protocols and oversight? And my second question is, what future strategies will be implemented to attract more talents to Hong Kong and are there plans to provide clearer pathways to long-term residency for successful Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) applicants, especially for those contributing significantly to the economy? Thank you.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. We are very concerned about the fatal industrial accident happened yesterday. The Labour Department has already issued a suspension order, and also we are looking into the whole accident. At this moment, we do not have anything further to provide, but just to make sure we will look into the whole accident strictly in accordance with our rules and the relevant laws. If there is any body or institution that eventually, through investigation, has to be held accountable for the whole accident, we will pursue in accordance with the law.

  Secondly, on talents, yesterday I shared the latest visa renewal outcome with the public. We are making full use of the whole spectrum of talent admission schemes available to us, including the schemes targeting those already had a job offer before arriving in Hong Kong. And also, for talents under the TTPS, where we only require them to prove either they are high-earners, or graduates from one of the top 100 universities in the world. We are encouraged by the visa renewal outcome of the TTPS. We are going to further step up our promotion, so that we are going to attract more talents to Hong Kong to help us grow our economy. Thank you very much."

大家早上好！開場白一定是我今日非常高興出席遊艇旅遊及遊艇經濟圓桌會議，與業界翹楚共聚一堂，但是我入到來才發現今日其實真的好像我初上任時所說，我原來是見老朋友、交新朋友。當然在座有些新朋友我今日第一次認識，但是老朋友有很多，包括我以前任職運輸署時的老朋友都到來，有些在我任職房屋署時認識的老朋友又來了，但原來他們都與今日的題目相關。還有一些就是我當年做旅遊事務副專員時已經與我一起並肩作戰的戰友都在座。我這個講辭寫得比較客氣，嚴肅正規，我想今日雖然有傳媒在場，但都是好朋友談談政策，如何做好這個政策，所以我覺得可以稍為輕鬆一點，因為我輕鬆一點，大家稍後發言也可以輕鬆一點，我可以聽到更多真知灼見。

其實遊艇旅遊去年，剛才盧主席也提到，行政長官在《施政報告》中提出，要以創新思維打造香港成為首選旅遊目的地。文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）於去年十二月三十日公布了《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》，當中特別強調要拓展海島旅遊，善用海濱資源。大家都亦聽過中央港澳工作辦公室夏寶龍主任（中央港澳工作辦公室主任、國務院港澳事務辦公室主任夏寶龍）提及過香港的旅遊資源、海島資源非常珍貴，我們應該用好。香港亦是「無處不旅遊」，我們這些本來已有的瑰寶，如何用好它們，是我們要思考的地方。所以致力推動遊艇旅遊成為我們推動高增值旅遊的重要一環。

剛才盧主席也提到，香港有263個島嶼和1 180公里的海岸線，我們的海岸線和島嶼資源是得天獨厚，具備發展遊艇旅遊的天然優勢。非常感謝經民聯提出的七項建議，涵蓋政策、基建、出入境、產業配套等各個方面，為推動香港與大灣區遊艇旅遊，以至其他地方來到香港的遊艇旅遊合作發展提供了寶貴方向。

文體旅局全力支持遊艇旅遊的發展，因為這與拓展和促進香港高增值旅遊活動的政策目標一致。在硬件配套方面，去年《施政報告》提出在三個地點，即香港仔避風塘擴建部分、前南丫石礦場和紅磡站臨海用地增加泊位設施。就香港仔避風塘擴建部分和前南丫石礦場用地，發展局今年較早時候已經邀請市場提交意向書，並正整理及分析蒐集到的意見。至於紅磡站臨海用地，政府早前已公布初步土地用途建議，並進行公眾諮詢。三個項目一共可帶來共近600個遊艇泊位，當早兩個地點更位於較市區的部分，紅磡和香港仔。我知道大家都希望新泊位設施能早日落成，政府的目標與大家是一致的。發展局已公開表示會盡快敲定發展參數和要求，進行各項技術評估和相關法定程序。如項目按傳統模式招標，招標會加快，政府也會積極考慮其他能加快流程的發展模式。

除了由政府主導的項目外，政府亦支持香港機場管理局擴大「機場城市」（SKYTOPIA）的發展，充分利用機場島及香港口岸人工島毗鄰的海域發展遊艇港灣，提供大概500個遊艇泊位及配套設施，並設有多元化的水上休閒及康樂設施；並同時在機場島東岸與港珠澳大橋香港口岸人工島之間的海域內發展機場城市灣畔，提供海灣度假酒店，以及毗鄰大概70個遊艇停泊位置。

當然，要興建遊艇停泊設施，我們需要相關的專業知識，除了碼頭設計外，剛才盧主席也提到，我們不是很多周末下雨，有時更打風下大雨。今早謝展寰局長（環境及生態局局長謝展寰）在電台也略略提到，我們現在在極端天氣頻繁下，很多時做填海和其他工程都要考慮如何設計，讓我們應對極端天氣時更有把握和及早預案。因此，防波堤、水流、電力和供水等設施，我們都很需要研究。

另外與泊位租務有關的議題，因為我們都很重視產業化，若建了泊位但不能提供經濟利益給香港，我想就不是最好的做法。因此，要完全發展用地的商業潛力，提議的遊艇停泊設施也需與岸上的零售、餐飲及娛樂設施結合起來，為訪客提供更多元的旅遊體驗。在發展這些新項目時，整個政府都會與業界保持溝通，務求項目發展能貼近市場需要，滿足真正用家的要求。

要推動遊艇旅遊，除增加遊艇停泊設施以解決泊位不足的問題外，也需要有到位的配套和便利措施配合。剛才盧主席提過的遊艇出入境、船員簽證、以至維修保養等的安排及配套設施都是重要的。就此，我知道業界已經透過不同渠道向政府表達意見。雖然涉及不同政策局和部門的工作，但本屆政府「one Government」、政府一體的原則好好實踐出來，所有相關政策局及部門會積極了解業界對發展遊艇旅遊及相關配套設施的意見和改善建議，考慮推出適切的拆牆鬆綁、便利措施，推動遊艇旅遊。

文體旅局希望隨着遊艇泊位增加，香港可吸引包括大灣區在內和祖國其他港口城市，以至世界各地港口城市的遊艇擁有人都可來到香港。遊艇旅遊有助吸引旅客來港消費和逗留，他們除可在船上欣賞世界著名的維多利亞港和到訪我們二百多個島嶼外，我們更期望他們上岸消費和活動，為香港商戶帶來新商機，亦為香港帶來更大經濟效益。我們會繼續全力支持粵港澳大灣區遊艇旅遊的發展和合作，以拓展和促進香港高增值旅遊活動，發揮香港「一程多站」示範核心區的角色。我們期待與業界和在座各位一同攜手，多用、用好香港美麗多樣的海島資源，讓全球旅客體驗香港近在咫尺的世界級大自然之美。

接下來，我希望聆聽業界在推動遊艇旅遊方面的寶貴意見，謝謝大家。"
暫停政府辦公室樽裝飲用水合約,2025-08-16 11:09,2025-08-16 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600266.htm,"政府物流服務署（物流署）表示，已由今日（八月十六日）起暫停供應港島和部分離島政府辦公室的樽裝飲用水合約。

物流署今年六月批出合約予鑫鼎鑫商貿有限公司（鑫鼎鑫）。根據合約，鑫鼎鑫由今年六月底起為港島和部分離島的政府辦公室提供由樂百氏（廣東）飲用水有限公司廣州分公司製造的「鑫樂」品牌樽裝飲用水，合約為期36個月。

物流署因應近日取得有關鑫鼎鑫的營運資料，未能信納鑫鼎鑫能繼續履行合約，遂決定根據合約條款由今日（八月十六日）起暫停有關合約。物流署會繼續嚴肅跟進，以採取進一步行動，包括是否終止有關合約。物流署亦已將事件交予警方調查。

為確保飲用水的供應，物流署已安排屈臣氏集團（香港）有限公司在下星期內開始暫時為港島和部分離島政府辦公室供應其製造的「COOL清涼」品牌樽裝飲用水。

物流署一直持續監察政府辦公室樽裝飲用水供應商履行合約的情況，確保供應商按合約條款穩定供應符合指定技術規格的樽裝飲用水以確保飲用水安全。供應商須每兩個月提交由獨立認可實驗室發出的測試報告以證明其提供的飲用水符合技術規格要求，而物流署亦會在合約期內不時抽取飲用水樣本作測試。就此，物流署早前已抽驗政府辦公室樽裝飲用水，證實所有供應商提供的樽裝飲用水均符合樽裝飲用水安全標準。

因應原有合約屆滿，物流署於今年三月透過公開招標，揀選合適供應商為政府部門供應樽裝飲用水。中標的三間公司及按其標書供應的飲用水品牌資料如下：

Lai Chee-ying has been receiving appropriate treatment during his detention,2025-08-15 23:32,2025-08-15 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081501009.htm,"âThe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (August 15) strongly condemns the out-of-context and fact-twisting reports on the court hearing of the case of Lai Chee-ying made by some foreign media including the US-based Cable News Network (CNN). Such reports attempt to mislead the public into believing that Lai Chee-ying did not receive the medical care he needed, in order to smear Lai Chee-ying's case under the Hong Kong National Security Law, as well as his custodial arrangements and the medical care services provided to him. Their aim to smear and undermine Hong Kong's rule of law is despicable and violates the professional conduct of journalists.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government stressed, ""During today's open court hearing, senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying clearly presented to the court that the correctional institutions arrange daily medical checkups for Lai Chee-ying and that there had been no complaints at all regarding the medical care he receives there. The Court commended the Correctional Services Department (CSD) while the Department of Justice stated that the prosecution is equally concerned about Lai Chee-ying's health and well-being. Therefore, the CSD has arranged for a professional medical team to be on standby on the spot, ready to respond to any emergency immediately if needed. External forces and anti-China media chose to turn a blind eye to these facts, and continued to repeat lies and engage in despicable operations. We must sternly denounce their wrongdoings.

""Before attending court, Lai Chee-ying has been certified by medical doctors that he was physically and mentally fit for court hearing. In fact, doctors stationed at correctional institutions and specialists from the Hospital Authority regularly follow-up on Lai Chee-ying's health conditions. As revealed during the hearing today, in view of Lai Chee-ying's claims of heart palpitations, after a visiting specialist from the Hospital Authority conducted a detailed examination on him on August 7, no abnormality was found. That said, as precaution, the specialist recommended prescribing medication to Lai Chee-ying to be taken as and when needed, and that he should wear a cardiac monitoring device, but Lai Chee-ying declined the advice of the specialist. On August 13, the CSD arranged for another detailed examination by a specialist from the Hospital Authority. The specialist again recommended that Lai Chee-ying wear a device to monitor his cardiac condition, which Lai Chee-ying accepted in the end. The Hospital Authority and the CSD immediately made such arrangements within a short period of time.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""The CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and that an environment with good ventilation, appropriate and timely medical support as well as healthy and nutritious meals are provided. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of persons in custody (PICs) are protected.""

""Facts speak louder than eloquence. The medical care received by Lai Chee-ying in custody is adequate and comprehensive. The CSD supports PICs with medical services provided by the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority. In general, examination and treatment are conducted by medical staff stationed in CSD facilities. Based on the needs of individual PICs, cases will be referred to specialist departments under the Hospital Authority for further follow-up. Hong Kong's medical standards are highly regarded worldwide. Professional medical staff provide the most suitable medical services to patients as soon as possible, and PICs are treated equally. The CSD and relevant units also adopt the above arrangements when handling matters related to Lai Chee-ying, which are no different from those applicable to other PICs,"" the spokesman pointed out."
Labour Department highly concerned about fatal work accident that happened in Siu Ho Wan today,2025-08-15 23:16,2025-08-15 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081501004.htm,"The Labour Department (LD) is highly concerned about a fatal work accident that happened at a train depot in Siu Ho Wan this noon (August 15), in which a male worker was hit by a reversing engineering train. The LD is saddened by the death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family.

 The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued a suspension notice to the employer concerned, suspending the operation of the engineering train. The employer cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

 The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the relevant duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

 To protect the traffic safety of workers in train depots, the LD reminds employers to take adequate safety precautions, including providing and maintaining safe walkways away from trains and demarcating designated walkways for workers by suitable barriers and warning notices; and providing all workers concerned with the necessary safety instruction and training and ensuring that workers adhere to the relevant safety precautions.

 The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

 In regard to today's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

 The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

 For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."
