雙方在會上商討推進實施「粵車南下」以及優化「港車北上」等工作。陳美寶表示：「自二○二三年七月一日推展『港車北上』政策以來，已有超過10萬輛車曾參加『港車北上』，港珠澳大橋的使用量亦屢創新高，今年五月的雙向車流量達45萬車次，即每日平均約15 000車次。今次的會議定於『港車北上』這個創新政策迎來兩周年的日子舉行，實在別具意義。」

她續指，粵港雙方一直致力推動各項跨境通行措施，促進粵港澳大灣區的人員進一步融合。兩地政府在過去兩年不斷優化「港車北上」安排，亦正積極為「粵車南下」的安排，包括使用兩個鄰近大橋香港口岸的自動化停車場到港轉機，或辦理入境手續進入香港，以及為粵車入境香港市區作仔細商討，在有序可控的情況下，為廣東省旅客提供選擇，回應市民雙向奔赴的殷切期盼，亦為香港帶來嶄新旅客群，惠及各行業。陳美寶亦順道參觀由運輸署安排在當地的驗車中心，了解相關運作，以期為「粵車南下」做好準備。

陳美寶已結束訪粵行程並於下午返港。"

The Commissioner for Transport, Ms Angela Lee, also joined the visit.

During the meeting, both sides discussed ways to promulgate the implementation of the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles (the Southbound Travel Scheme) and optimise the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles (the Northbound Travel Scheme). Ms Chan said, ""Since the launch of the Northbound Travel Scheme on July 1, 2023, over 100 000 vehicles have participated in the scheme. The usage of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) has also recorded new highs, with its two-way vehicular flow reaching a total of 450 000 vehicles in May 2025, i.e. a daily average of about 15 000 vehicles. Holding this meeting on the second anniversary of the innovative Northbound Travel Scheme is indeed very meaningful.""

She continued that Guangdong and Hong Kong have been committed to promoting various cross-boundary transport measures to strengthen greater integration of people in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Over the past two years, the governments of both sides have been enhancing the arrangements for the Northbound Travel Scheme while proactively preparing for the Southbound Travel Scheme, including the use of two automated carparks near the HZMB Hong Kong Port for passengers to transfer flights in Hong Kong or go through immigration clearance to enter Hong Kong, as well as allowing Guangdong vehicles to enter Hong Kong urban areas. Under orderly and controllable circumstances, the Southbound Travel Scheme aims to provide options for tourists from Guangdong Province, meeting the keen expectations of the public on two-way travel and bringing new visitor segments to Hong Kong, which will benefit various industries. Ms Chan also took the opportunity to visit a local vehicle examination centre arranged by the Transport Department to learn about its operation, making good preparations for the Southbound Travel Scheme.

âMs Chan concluded her duty visit to Guangzhou and returned to Hong Kong this afternoon."

 Upon further investigation, Police believed the woman had been to a unit on Castle Peak Road, Cheung Sha Wan, accompanied by a foreign man suspected to be involved in the case before her disappearance. Some bloodstains were found in the unit. Chemical examination showed that the bloodstains belonged to the 49-year-old woman.

 Police arrested a 25-year-old foreign woman on June 25 in Sham Shui Po, believed that she assisted the man fled after the case. She was laid a holding charge with one count of “assisting an offender"" and the case was mentioned at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts on June 27.

"HyD signs investigation, design and construction consultancy agreement for Hong Kong section of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link (Hung Shui Kiu-Qianhai) (with photo)",2025-06-30 15:58,2025-06-30 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000356.htm,"  The Highways Department (HyD) today (June 30) signed an investigation, design and construction consultancy agreement with the AtkinsRealis - AECOM Joint Venture for the Hong Kong section of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link (Hung Shui Kiu-Qianhai) (HSWRL). The professional team formed by the Joint Venture comprises an engineering design consultant from the Mainland, Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute (Group) Company Limited; a local financial consultant, KPMG Advisory (Hong Kong) Limited, and professional members in various other disciplines. The HyD will work with the Joint Venture to take forward the investigation and design work for the project at full steam.

â  A spokesman for the HyD said, ""Construction of the HSWRL is a crucial initiative in support of thorough implementation of the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). It enhances the infrastructure connectivity in the GBA and facilitates Hong Kong’s better integration into national development. The HSWRL will connect the metro networks in the western regions of Hong Kong and Shenzhen. A trip from Hung Shui Kiu to Qianhai will only take approximately 15 minutes, which will help to foster the 'one-hour living circle' in the GBA and facilitate convenient cross-boundary commerce, work, living, study and travelling activities of the residents of the two places. The HSWRL is also an important transport infrastructure promoting the development of the Northern Metropolis, catering to the local travelling demand in the Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area as well as Lau Fau Shan, Tsim Bei Tsui and Pak Nai areas. We aim to have the project ready for tendering in 2027, so that the detailed design and construction works can commence promptly, striving to achieve completion of construction works in 2034, followed by integrated testing and commissioning to realise the common goal of the governments of Hong Kong and Shenzhen to commission the HSWRL in 2035.""

â  The HSWRL is approximately 18.1 kilometres long (with the Hong Kong section and the Shenzhen section being about 7.3 km long and 10.8 km long respectively). The alignment will start from the west of Hung Shui Kiu Station under construction on the Tuen Ma Line, passing through Ha Tsuen and Lau Fau Shan, crossing Deep Bay and connecting to Qianhai via Shenzhen Bay Port. It is an underground railway line comprising a total of five stations, with three stations in Hong Kong (located in Hung Shui Kiu, Ha Tsuen and Lau Fau Shan respectively) and two stations in Shenzhen (located in Shenzhen Bay Port and Qianhaiwan respectively). Hong Kong and Shenzhen have agreed to establish the co-location of the immigration and customs facilities in Shenzhen and the depot will be located at Ha Tsuen.

â  The project provides opportunities for Hong Kong and Shenzhen to draw on each other's strengths and experiences in taking forward railway projects, so as to further enhance the efficiency and quality of railway development and strive for excellence. The HyD endeavours to explore ways to combine Hong Kong's flexibility and versatility with the Mainland's strengths in infrastructure development. Through ""dual-innovation"" in policy and technology, the HyD will explore different implementation approaches with the goal to reduce construction cost and compress construction time."
HA appeals to public for two patients requiring urgent liver transplants,2025-06-30 15:56,2025-06-30 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000488.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

 The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) today (June 30) made the following appeal regarding two patients whose condition requires urgent liver transplants:

 Two patients who require urgent liver transplants are currently hospitalised at Queen Mary Hospital and are in critical condition. One of the patients has been experiencing severe hepatic and renal failure, entering the state of hepatic coma. He has developed hepatorenal syndrome and severe complications due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently in the Adult Intensive Care Unit due to his critical condition. He is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation to maintain life. The other patient has been experiencing severe liver failure and severe damage to his kidney function. He has developed severe complications due to hepatorenal syndrome. Both patients are clinically assessed as requiring urgent liver transplants and are listed at the top of the liver transplant waiting list, according to the blood groups.

 In response to the urgent appeal from the patients' families, the HA appeals to members of the public to proactively support organ donation and consider donating the organ of a deceased relative to rekindle the lives of others.

 In view of the critical condition of the patients, in addition to proactively searching for suitable livers locally, the HA will also seek assistance from the Mainland through the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government as soon as possible. When a patient who is willing to donate an organ passes away and no suitable patient is identified to receive the organ on the Mainland, the cross-boundary organ donation and matching mechanism will facilitate a transplant in Hong Kong to bring hope to a critically ill patient.

 The spokesperson emphasised that when a suitable liver is found, the HA will strictly follow the relevant organ transplant regulations and make an application with the authorities to ensure that all procedures comply with relevant standards and regulatory requirements. The HA will arrange transplant operations that aim to save the patient's life as soon as possible.

 For critically ill patients with organ failure, an organ transplant is often the only hope to extend their lives. When the families of deceased patients show a selfless act of love and donate the deceased person's organs to save dying patients, it not only gives critically ill patients the hope of life, but also eases the hardship of their families. The HA appeals to the public to pass on their great love, blessing and care to those who are still fighting for their well-deserved lives."

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（六月三十日）就兩名急須換肝病人的情況作以下呼籲︰

兩名急須換肝的病人現時在瑪麗醫院留醫，情況危殆。其中一名病人肝腎功能嚴重衰竭，進入肝昏迷狀態，並出現肝腎症候群和肝性腦病的嚴重併發症，目前在成人深切治療部留醫，需要依靠人工呼吸機維持生命；另一名病人肝臟功能嚴重衰竭，腎功能亦嚴重受損，出現肝腎症候群的嚴重併發症。兩名病人經臨床評估後判斷急需接受肝臟移植，現時位列於各自血型的肝臟移植輪候名冊的首位。

醫管局響應病人家屬的緊急呼籲，希望市民踴躍支持器官捐贈，積極考慮捐出離世親人的器官，遺愛人間。

鑑於有關病人的情況十分危急，醫管局除了積極在本地為病人尋找合適的肝臟外，亦已準備通過香港特別行政區政府向內地尋求協助。當內地出現願意捐贈器官的病人離世後，而在當地沒有合適病人接受作移植，可協調將器官跨境捐贈到香港作配對移植，為危急病人帶來重生希望。

發言人強調，當尋獲合適的肝臟時，醫管局將嚴格按照相關的器官移植法規，從速向監管機構作出申請，確保所有程序符合有關標準及法規要求，並會盡快安排移植手術，為病人帶來重生的希望。

對於器官衰竭的危急病人，器官移植是他們延續生命的唯一希望。離世病人及家屬施予無私大愛，捐出遺體器官救助性命垂危的病人，不單給予危急病人重生的希望，更讓病人家屬在艱難中得以解困。醫管局呼籲市民，發揮大愛與關懷精神，讓愛承傳，為正在奮力求生的病人送上祝福和重生的希望。"

Marine Department officers to use body-worn video cameras in discharging duties in Hong Kong waters (with photo),2025-06-30 15:30,2025-06-30 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000329.htm," A spokesperson for the Marine Department (MD) said today (June 30) that starting from tomorrow (July 1), frontline officers of the Harbour Patrol Section in all districts of the department will fully use body-worn video cameras to more effectively assist in investigations and enhance their ability to collect evidence when performing their duties in Hong Kong waters, as well as to record on-site sea situations during major events at sea to ensure marine safety.

 Between January and June this year, the MD conducted a field trial in the waters around Victoria Harbour to evaluate the effectiveness of using body-worn video cameras. The evaluation of the test results showed that frontline officers'use of body-worn video cameras in discharging their duties can help enhance the capability and accuracy of evidence collection, providing practical information for future investigations. It can also enable frontline officers to discharge their duties in a more effective manner.

 To optimise the use of body-worn video cameras, the MD has formulated the relevant guidelines. When carrying out their duties, the MD frontline officers are required to wear uniforms and mount the body-worn video cameras in a conspicuous position on their bodies. They should give any person concerned reasonable and public advance notice before commencing the recording as far as practicable.

 The MD takes all necessary steps to comply with the requirements of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) when handling the collected personal data. Any video footage that carries no investigative or evidential value, or that constitutes no other legitimate purpose, will be deleted 31 days after the date it was recorded, to ensure that no excessive personal data are kept.

申領或續期本地合格證明書的新要求今日起全面實施,2025-06-30 15:05,2025-06-30 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000319.htm,"海事處今日（六月三十日）宣布，由即日起實施申領或續期本地合格證明書的申請人必須提交由認可醫生簽發的健康證明書的新要求。

《商船（本地船隻）（證明書及牌照事宜）規例》（第548D章）規定所有本地船隻的操作人員均必須持有本地合格證明書。

為提高海上安全，海事處現修改申領或續領本地合格證明書的資格，引入健康證明書要求，以確保本地合格證明書持有人體格適合操作船隻。有關健康證明書的要求涵蓋兩類人士：第一類涉及所有新申請或續領任何級別的本地合格證明書的人士；第二類只涉及操作載客船（即第I類別船隻）以及運載氣體、有毒液體物質、石油等運輸船（即第II類別內指定類型船隻）（統稱「高風險船隻」）的船長和輪機操作員。

所有新申請本地合格證明書及續領本地合格證明書的人士，在提交申請表時，均須向海事處一併提交由認可醫生所簽發的健康證明書。本地合格證明書一經發出，其有效期在持有人年屆65歲時方告失效。本地合格證明書持有人在年屆65歲後，如欲續期其證明書，將須每三年接受並通過健康評估。當持有人年滿71歲後，則須在每年通過健康評估後，方可續期。

考慮到操作高風險船隻的海上安全風險相對較高，所有操作高風險船隻的船長和輪機操作員須每五年接受一次健康評估，以確保其身體情況適合操作有關船隻。操作高風險船隻人員在獲發健康證明書後，須向海事處提交該證明書副本以作記錄。海事處會在有關高風險船隻的運作牌照上附加牌照條件，以實施相關健康證明書要求。

海事處已就有關新安排及細節要求廣泛諮詢業界，並獲得各持份者，包括立法會經濟發展事務委員會、本地船隻諮詢委員會、商會、工會以及漁民聯會支持。海事處將會繼續以不同渠道向本地合格證明書持有人宣傳新要求。

New requirement for application for or revalidation of local certificates of competency fully implemented today,2025-06-30 15:05,2025-06-30 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000320.htm," The Marine Department (MD) announced today (June 30) a new requirement for application for or revalidation of local certificates of competency (CoC), whereby a medical fitness certificate issued by a recognised medical practitioner must be submitted with immediate effect.

  The Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (Certification and Licensing) Regulation (Cap. 548D) stipulates that all local vessel operators must hold a valid local CoC.

  To enhance marine safety, the MD has revised the eligibility criteria for applying for or revalidating local CoCs by introducing a medical fitness certificate requirement to ensure that holders of local CoCs are physically fit to operate vessels. The medical fitness requirement involves two categories of persons: Category I covers all applicants for the initial issuance or revalidation of any grade of local CoCs; Category II only covers coxswains and engine operators in charge of passenger vessels (i.e. Class I vessels) and vessels carrying gases, noxious liquid substances, oil, etc (i.e. Class II vessels with designated types) (collectively referred to as ""high-risk vessels"").

  All applicants for issuance and revalidation of local CoCs are required to submit to the MD a medical fitness certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner recognised by the MD together with the application form. Once issued, a local CoC will remain valid until the holder reaches the age of 65. Holders of local CoCs who wish to revalidate their CoCs after reaching the age of 65 will have to undergo and pass a medical assessment every three years. After reaching the age of 71, a holder must pass a medical assessment every year in order to revalidate the CoC.

  Considering the relatively higher marine safety risks associated with operating high-risk vessels, all coxswains and engine operators of high-risk vessels are required to undergo a medical assessment every five years to ensure that they are physically fit to operate the relevant vessels. Operators of high-risk vessels must submit a copy of the medical fitness certificate to the MD for record after obtaining the certificate. This requirement will be implemented by the MD through adding a new licensing condition to the Operating Licences of relevant high-risk vessels.

  The MD has already conducted extensive consultations with the industry regarding the new arrangements and detailed requirements, and has received support from various stakeholders, including the Legislative Council Panel on Economic Development, the Local Vessels Advisory Committee, trade associations, trade unions, and fishermen's associations. The MD will continue to promote the new requirements to local CoC holders through various means.

  For details about the latest requirements for application for or revalidation of local CoC, including the list of recognised medical practitioners, the medical assessment form, the examination rules for local CoCs and the relevant MD Notice, please visit the MD's website."
環境及生態局局長在立法會環境事務委員會會議就《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》開場發言（只有中文）,2025-06-30 15:00,2025-06-30 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000517.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（六月三十日）下午在立法會環境事務委員會會議，就《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

環境保護是我們的國策，也是香港長遠可持續發展的關鍵。今年四月二十三日，習近平主席在氣候和公正轉型領導人峰會上表明：「無論國際形勢如何變化，中國積極應對氣候變化的行動不會放緩，促進國際合作的努力不會減弱，推動構建人類命運共同體的實踐不會停歇。」

為配合國家的「雙碳」目標，香港力爭在二○三五年前把碳排放量減半，並務求在二○五○年前實現碳中和。香港的碳排放總量在二○一四年已達峰，並持續呈下降趨勢。二○二三年，香港溫室氣體排放總量較二○一四年峰值下降約四分之一。香港人均排放是美國人的三成，歐盟的六成。

今屆政府通過推動源頭減廢及擴大回收網絡，成功扭轉廢物棄置量多年來長期不斷上升的趨勢。都市固體廢物的棄置量自二○二一年至二○二四年減少了共7.5%。廢物回收率也由二○二○年的28％，上升至二○二三年的33％。首座轉廢為能設施I•PARK1亦將於年底啓用。推動綠色運輸方面，過去五年，電動車數目增加約八倍，現時新登記私家車，十輛中約有七輛是電動車，增速位於世界前列。

主席，因應外部環境變化，香港的經濟正在急速轉型，與粵港澳大灣區的發展亦逐漸密不可分。邁向碳中和，必須能夠與經濟發展並行，才可以成功。展望未來，我們會把經濟轉型和邁向碳中和，化挑戰為機遇，通過發展新質生產力，大力推動發展新能源、無廢大灣區、綠色金融，以及低碳綠色技術和產業。

接下來我請同事介紹《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》的工作進展。"
海事處推出綠色船用燃料加注獎勵計劃以鼓勵相關發展,2025-06-30 15:00,2025-06-30 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000357.htm,"海事處今日（六月三十日）宣布推出綠色船用燃料加注獎勵計劃，以促進香港發展成為高質量的綠色船用燃料加注中心。

國際海事組織已設定進取的目標，力求在二○五○年前後實現國際航運淨零碳排放。在國際海事組織的關鍵政策推動下，國際海運業綠色轉型的趨勢不可逆轉，低碳燃料以至零碳燃料的使用迅速普及。

為配合及鼓勵航運業綠色轉型，政府於二○二四年十一月十五日公布了《綠色船用燃料加注行動綱領》，訂立明確的目標，以及五大綠色導向的策略和十項行動，以支持香港發展綠色船用燃料加注及交易。《行動綱領》中提出的其中一項行動是設立綠色船用燃料加注獎勵計劃，鼓勵於香港開展綠色船用燃料加注業務的先行企業。

考慮到公司開展綠色船用燃料加注業務前須作出投資進行風險評估等準備工作，而且先行企業將為開拓行業發展鋪路並積累寶貴經驗，政府將向這些企業提供獎勵。該計劃以液化天然氣和綠色甲醇為目標，對於每間先行企業在海事處接受其風險評估後一年內完成的首兩次液化天然氣或綠色甲醇加注操作，每次操作將可獲得50萬元的獎勵。在計劃推出前已完成相關評估及／或加注操作的先行企業也合符資格在計劃下獲得獎勵。就每種獲認可的綠色船用燃料所發放的獎勵金額最高為200萬元，獎勵將以先到先得的方式發放。詳情請參閱附件中的《綠色船用燃料加注獎勵計劃簡介》。

海事處發言人表示：「中國香港作為國際海事組織的聯繫會員，一直致力於支持其減排目標。同時，發展香港綠色船用燃料加注能力能發揮本港港口現有的獨特優勢，包括位於中國最南端、毗鄰國際航道的位置，以維持香港作為主要加注港口和國際海運中心的地位。計劃有助於鼓勵先行企業及早在香港開展綠色船用燃料加注業務，並有助於為先行企業與後來者締造公平的競爭環境。」

Marine Department launches Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Incentive Scheme to encourage relevant development,2025-06-30 15:00,2025-06-30 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000367.htm," The Marine Department (MD) announced today (June 30) the launch of the Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Incentive Scheme to facilitate the development of Hong Kong into a high-quality green maritime fuel bunkering centre.

 The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set an ambitious target to reach net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by or around 2025. Under the key policy drive of the IMO, the international maritime industry is now undergoing an irreversible green transformation, and the use of low- or even zero-carbon fuels is quickly gaining popularity.

 To complement and encourage the green transformation of the shipping industry, the Government promulgated the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering on November 15, 2024, setting out clear targets, five green-centric strategies and 10 actions to support the development of green maritime fuel bunkering and trading in Hong Kong. One of the actions proposed in the Action Plan is to set up a Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Incentive Scheme, which serves to encourage pioneer companies to develop green maritime fuel bunkering business in Hong Kong.

 Considering that certain investments in preparatory work, including risk assessments by companies, are required before carrying out green maritime fuel bunkering, and the pioneer companies will help kick-start the industry development by paving the way and accumulating invaluable experience, incentives will be granted to these companies. Under the current tranche of the Scheme, which targets liquefied natural gas (LNG) and green methanol, an incentive of $500,000 will be granted to each pioneer company for each of its first two LNG or green methanol bunkering operations completed within one year from the MD's acceptance of its risk assessment. Pioneer companies that have already completed the relevant assessments and/or bunkering operations before the Scheme launch are also eligible to receive incentives under the Scheme. The maximum amount of incentive for each type of recognised green maritime fuel is $2,000,000, and incentives will be disbursed on a first-come, first-served basis. Details are set out in the Introduction of the Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Incentive Scheme in the Annex.

 A spokesperson for the MD said, ""Hong Kong, China, as an associate member of the IMO, has long been committed to supporting the IMO's emission reduction target. At the same time, the development of green maritime fuel bunkering capabilities in Hong Kong will allow us to capitalise on the existing unique advantages of our port, including our location at the southernmost tip of China next to the international fairway, to maintain our positioning as a major bunkering port and international maritime centre. The Scheme will help encourage pioneer enterprises to start green maritime fuel bunkering businesses in Hong Kong early, as well as help level the playing field between pioneers and late joiners.""

  ""The MD has established a dedicated team that provides one-stop services to companies interested in setting up green shipping-related businesses in Hong Kong. At the same time, we also provide clear guidelines and support to companies interested in conducting green maritime fuel bunkering operations in Hong Kong, to facilitate their smooth completion of the relevant assessments and pre-bunkering procedures,"" the spokesperson continued.

 The application form of the Scheme has been uploaded onto the MD's website. Application forms will also be provided to relevant applicant companies by the Green Maritime Fuel Team of the MD upon request. For details, please contact the Green Maritime Fuel Team of the MD via email: greenfuel@mardep.gov.hk."
CFS announces food safety report for May,2025-06-30 15:00,2025-06-30 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025062700551.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (June 30) released the findings of its food safety report for last month. The results of about 6 400 food samples tested (including food items purchased online) were found to be satisfactory except for six unsatisfactory samples that were announced earlier. The overall satisfactory rate was 99.9 per cent.

A CFS spokesman said that about 2 000 food samples were collected for microbiological tests, and about 4 400 samples were taken for chemical and radiation level tests.

The microbiological tests covered pathogens and hygiene indicators; the chemical tests included testing for pesticides, preservatives, metallic contaminants, colouring matters, veterinary drug residues and others; and the radiation-level tests included testing for radioactive caesium and iodine in samples collected from imported food from different regions.

The samples comprised about 1 600 samples of vegetables and fruit and their products; about 500 samples of cereals, grains and their products; about 600 samples of meat and poultry and their products; about 1 300 samples of milk, milk products and frozen confections; about 900 samples of aquatic and related products; and about 1 500 samples of other food commodities (including beverages, bakery products and snacks).

The six unsatisfactory samples comprised two mushroom samples and a prepackaged dried lily bulb sample detected with metallic contaminants exceeding the legal limit, a white radish sample and a melon sample detected with pesticide residues at levels exceeding the legal limit, and a pig ear sample found to contain Salmonella.

The CFS has taken follow-up actions on the above-mentioned unsatisfactory samples, including informing the vendors concerned of the test results, instructing them to stop selling the affected food items, and tracing the sources of the food items in question.

The spokesman reminded the food trade to ensure that food is fit for human consumption and meets legal requirements. Consumers should patronise reliable shops when buying food and maintain a balanced diet to minimise food risks.

Separately, in response to the Japanese Government's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the CFS will continue enhancing the testing on imported Japanese food, and make reference to the risk assessment results to adjust relevant surveillance work in a timely manner. The CFS will announce every working day on its dedicated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/daily_japan_nuclear_incidents.html) the radiological test results of the samples of food imported from Japan, with a view to enabling the trade and members of the public to have a better grasp of the latest safety information."

Good morning and a big welcome to Hong Kong. It gives me great pleasure to join you today for the opening ceremony of the 26thAIPS Asia Congress. First of all, I would like to thank AIPS Asia and the Hong Kong Sports Press Association for bringing this important event to Hong Kong for the first time.

This year 2025 marks a landmark chapter for Hong Kong as a premier sports events hub. In March, we proudly opened theKai Tak Sports Park, a world-class sports infrastructure. I am sure some of you have already attended thrilling international sports events like the iconic Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, as well as the fascinating concerts that took place at the Kai Tak Stadium. In four weeks’ time, the Hong Kong Football Festival 2025 will bring Liverpool (FC) vs AC Milan, and the first ever North London Derby outside London, Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur, to the Kai Tai Stadium. These sold-out matches of course promise to be an extravaganza for football fans in this part of the world.

In November this year, Hong Kong will join hands withGuangdong Province and MacaoSAR (Special Administrative Region) to co-host the15th National Games of the People's Republic of China. You know, to quote Ma Long, our ping pong captain of China, for many of the sports, ping pong in particular, winning a National Games gold medal is harder than winning an Olympic gold, because the athletes usually have the accolade of a world champion somewhere. All these events are more than just games and competitions. They showcase Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events and create a festive atmosphere all through our city.

To all our sports journalist friends here, we are going to keep you busy. You will be our partners to capture the many thrilling moments on the stage as well as the compelling human stories behind. Your work will bring all these events to life for audiences around the world, and I look forward to seeing you all at our sports venues, chronicling these defining moments.

Before I close, I cordially invite you to immerse yourself in the unique charm and the iconic attractions of Hong Kong during your stay. I wish the Congress every success and I eagerly anticipate seeing your coverage of our mega events on your platforms. Thank you very much."

《香港國安法》實施五周年 以高水平安全護航高質量發展,2025-06-30 10:30,2025-06-30 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025062900718.htm,"​今日（六月三十日）是《香港國安法》公布實施五周年，香港特別行政區（特區）政府發言人表示，這是重要的日子，因為過去五年來，《香港國安法》為香港實現由亂到治的重大轉折；為維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，奠定了堅實的法律基礎，更是「一國兩制」事業的重要里程碑。

發言人說︰「國家安全是頭等大事，是國家生存與發展的根本前提。香港回歸後一段長時間，在維護國家安全方面處於『不設防』狀態，反中亂港分子及外部敵對勢力不斷挑戰『一國兩制』的原則底線，甚至妄圖奪取香港管治權。從二○一二年『反國教』、二○一四年非法『佔中』、二○一六年旺角暴動，以至二○一九年六月起持續十多個月的『黑暴』和港版『顏色革命』，為香港帶來前所未見的危機，對香港社會、經濟和營商環境造成嚴重破壞，令廣大市民惶恐終日。」

「中央在香港危急關頭果斷出手，全國人民代表大會在二○二○年五月二十八日通過相關決定，並由全國人民代表大會常務委員會在二○二○年六月三十日制定《香港國安法》，將其列入《基本法》附件三，由香港特區在本地公布實施，填補了香港特區維護國家安全法律制度和執行機制的短板漏洞，發揮定海神針的作用，止暴制亂，效果立竿見影，成為香港『由亂到治』的分水嶺，『一法安香江』。」

「其後，憑着特區政府連同立法會及社會各界的努力，香港特區切實履行憲制責任，去年成功完成《基本法》第二十三條本地立法，訂立《維護國家安全條例》，並在二○二四年三月二十三日刊憲生效，完善香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制，與《香港國安法》兼容互補、渾然一體，為香港築牢維護國家安全的堅實屏障。」

發言人強調︰「五年來的實踐證明，《香港國安法》是捍衛『一國兩制』、維護香港繁榮穩定的『守護神』，是具有重大歷史意義和現實意義的好法律。《香港國安法》與其他香港特區維護國家安全的法律均堅持法治原則，同時依法保護權利和自由。今天，香港的營商環境持續改善，位居全球最自由經濟體的榜首、國際金融中心地位穩佔世界第三、世界競爭力排名重返三甲，可見香港正在『由治及興』的大道上全速前進。」

「香港特區維護國家安全的法律保障人權。尊重和保障人權的原則具體細緻地貫穿和體現於《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的條文及相關法律的實施過程。《香港國安法》第四條及《維護國家安全條例》第2條均明確訂明，香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港特區居民根據《基本法》和《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》、《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港的有關規定享有的包括言論、新聞、出版的自由，結社、集會、遊行、示威的自由在內的權利和自由。香港特區維護國家安全法律的各項規定均符合國際標準，在維護國家安全和保障人權自由之間取得合理平衡。」

「事實上，香港特區法治堅實強韌，深受國際社會認可。香港特區執法部門嚴格根據證據和依照法律採取執法行動。律政司在《基本法》第六十三條的保障下主管刑事檢控工作，不受任何干涉，並嚴謹和客觀地按照《檢控守則》以證據和適用法律就每宗案件作出獨立的檢控決定。《基本法》第二條、第十九條及第八十五條明確規定，香港特區享有獨立的司法權和終審權，法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉。所有案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同。同時，《香港國安法》第五條及《維護國家安全條例》第2條亦明確訂明，防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪時，應當堅持法治原則，包括罪刑法定、無罪推定、一事不再審等原則，並保障犯罪嫌疑人、被告人和其他訴訟參與人依法享有的辯護權和其他訴訟權利。」

「每個國家都會制定維護國家安全法律，這不僅是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》清楚訂明構成有關危害國家安全罪行的元素和刑罰，精準針對佔極少數從事危害國家安全的行為和活動的個人和組織，保障廣大市民的人身和財產安全，奉公守法的人不會從事危害國家安全的行為和活動，不會誤墮法網，根本無需擔心。事實上，自《香港國安法》公布實施以來，社會迅速回復穩定，加上《維護國家安全條例》生效，香港特區居民和在香港的其他人的權利和自由得到更有效保障，經濟持續向好。」

發言人重申：「維護國家安全只有進行時，沒有完成時。中央在二○二五年五月十二日發布的《新時代的中國國家安全白皮書》提到，有域外勢力加大插手中國事務，企圖透過所謂香港問題對中國進行圍堵、打壓、遏制。在地緣政治風險不斷升溫的今天，特區政府必定繼續在《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的堅實保障下，堅決維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，持續完善相關法律制度和執行機制，以更有效應對不斷變化的國安風險挑戰；以及深化宣傳教育，讓每位市民都自覺維護國家安全，從而形成抵禦外部干預的社會基礎，以高水平安全護航高質量發展，不斷譜寫『一國兩制』實踐新篇章。」"
Ensuring high-quality development with high-level security: Hong Kong National Security Law heralds fifth anniversary,2025-06-30 10:30,2025-06-30 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025062900720.htm,"âToday (June 30) marks the fifth anniversary of the promulgation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). A spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government said, ""this is a significant day because over the past five years, the HKNSL has enabled Hong Kong to make a major transition from chaos to order and has laid a solid legal foundation for safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests. This in itself is an important milestone in the undertaking of ""one country, two systems"".

The spokesman said, ""National security is a top priority as it forms the basis for a country's existence and development. After reunification, Hong Kong had long been 'undefended' in terms of safeguarding national security. Anti-China elements and external forces continuously challenged the bottom line of the principle of 'one country, two systems', and even attempted to seize the power of governance. Unprecedented crises have been brought to Hong Kong by the 'anti-national education' incident in 2012, the illegal 'Occupy Central' movement in 2014, the Mong Kok riot in 2016, the 'black-clad violence' and Hong Kong version of the 'colour revolution' which lasted for more than ten months since June 2019, severely damaging Hong Kong's societal, economic and business environment and caused the public to live in fear.""

   ""The Central Authorities acted decisively at a critical moment for Hong Kong. On May 28, 2020, the National People's Congress (NPC) made a relevant decision on the basis of which, the NPC Standing Committee enacted, on June 30, 2020, the HKNSL which was then listed under Annex III to the Basic Law for local promulgation and implementation in the HKSAR. The HKNSL has addressed the shortcomings and plugged the loopholes in the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security of the HKSAR, playing the role of a stabilising force that immediately stopped violence and curbed disorder. The implementation of HKNSL was a 'watershed moment' in Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order, as stability and safety of the city have been restored by the law.""

   ""Thereafter, with the concerted efforts of the HKSAR Government, the Legislative Council and all sectors of the community, the HKSAR fulfilled its constitutional duty last year by completing the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law. The Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) took effect upon gazettal on March 23, 2024, improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security. The HKNSL and the SNSO are compatible and complementary, building a strong line of defence to safeguard national security in Hong Kong.""

The spokesman emphasised, ""The implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven the law to be a 'guardian' in upholding the principle of 'one country, two systems' and in safeguarding the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. It is an important and timely piece of legislation with profound historical significance. The HKNSL and other laws in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR firmly adhere to the principle of the rule of law while protecting the rights and freedoms in accordance with the law. At present, the business environment has continuously improved. Hong Kong ranks first as the world's freest economy and third among global financial centres, and has returned to the top three in the world in terms of competitiveness, demonstrating that Hong Kong is moving full steam ahead along the path of 'advancing from stability to prosperity'.""

   ""The laws for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR protect human rights. The principles of respecting and protecting human rights, as clearly and comprehensively set out, are embodied in the provisions of the HKNSL and the SNSO as well as in the manner in which they are implemented. Both Article 4 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. The various provisions of the laws for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR are in line with international standards, striking a reasonable balance between safeguarding national security and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.""

   ""In fact, the HKSAR has a solid, resilient foundation of the rule of law that is well-recognised by the international community. The law enforcement agencies of the HKSAR have been strictly taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and in accordance with the law. The Department of Justice of the HKSAR, by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law, controls criminal prosecutions, free from any interference. Independent prosecutorial decisions for each case are made in a rigorous and objective manner, strictly based on evidence and applicable laws and are in accordance with the Prosecution Code. Articles 2, 19 and 85 of the Basic Law specifically provide that the HKSAR enjoys independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication, and the courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the occupation, political stance or background of the persons involved. In addition, Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security, including the principles of conviction and punishment only by the application of the law, the presumption of innocence, the prohibition of double jeopardy, and the right to defend oneself and other rights in judicial proceedings that a criminal suspect, defendant and other parties in judicial proceedings are entitled to under the law.""

   ""It is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. The HKNSL and the SNSO clearly define the elements and penalties of the related offences endangering national security, precisely targeting an extremely small minority of people and organisations committing in acts and activities that endanger national security, while protecting the lives and property of the general public. Law abiding persons will not engage in acts and activities that endanger national security and will not unwittingly violate the law, and therefore have no reason to be concerned. As a matter of fact, since the promulgation and implementation of the HKNSL, stability has been quickly restored in society. With the SNSO in effect, the rights and freedoms of the HKSAR residents and of other persons in Hong Kong are even better protected while the economy of Hong Kong is picking up.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""Safeguarding national security is an ongoing and endless commitment. As mentioned in the 'White Paper on China's National Security in the New Era' published by the Central Authorities on May 12, 2025, external forces have meddled more in China's affairs, with an attempt to blockade, suppress and contain China through the so-called 'Hong Kong issues'. Today, as geopolitical risks continue to escalate, the HKSAR Government will strive steadfastly to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and improve the relevant legal system and enforcement mechanisms under the robust protection of the HKNSL and the SNSO, so as to address the evolving national security risks and challenges more effectively. We will also ramp up our efforts in publicity and education to arouse public awareness in safeguarding national security, thereby forming a societal shield to fend off external intervention, ensuring high-quality development with high-level security, continuously composing a new chapter in the practice of 'one country, two systems'.""

HKSAR Government responds to media enquiries on relaxation of import control measures on Japanese food products by the Mainland,2025-06-30 00:56,2025-06-30 01:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000054.htm,"In response to media enquiries about the relaxation of import control measures on Japanese food products by the Mainland, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government issued the following statement today (June 30):

The General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China issued on June 29, 2025 the ""Notice on Conditional Resumption of the Import of Aquatic Products from Certain Regions in Japan"" (the Notice), announcing that the import of some aquatic products of Japanese origin will be resumed with immediate effect, except for 10 metropolis/prefectures. According to the Notice, the import must comply with the relevant national laws and regulations, and food safety standards, and that the Japanese authority must effectively discharge its official regulatory responsibilities.

In response to the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water from Fukushima into the sea by the Japanese government, the HKSAR Government has since August 24, 2023 banned the import of aquatic products from 10 higher-risk metropolis/prefectures, including Tokyo, Fukushima, Chiba, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Gunma, Miyagi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, to safeguard food safety and protect public health in Hong Kong.

The duration and scale of the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station are unprecedented. Therefore, we must act in a prudent manner.

The HKSAR Government has been maintaining communication with the Japanese authority on the relevant issues, including requesting Japan to provide information on the latest development and scientific evidence concerning the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water, to assess whether there are conditions for relaxing the current precautionary measures. The HKSAR Government will make a public announcement if there is any policy adjustment."

Daryl（香港創新基金主席黃永光）、Regina（行政會議非官守議員召集人葉劉淑儀議員）、萬寧副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室青年工作部副部長）、Mr David Taji（日內瓦國際發明展評審團主席 Mr David Taji-Farouki） 、各位評審、各位嘉賓、各位校長、老師、同學：

大家下午好！我非常高興再次出席由香港創新基金主辦的香港創科展2024-2025頒獎典禮。今年的創科展已經來到第四屆，我感謝大會的悉心籌備，讓本屆活動延續過往的活力與創意，為更多的學生搭建一個向大眾展現創意和追求科學卓越的舞台。

今天，日內瓦發明展的評審主席Mr Taji Farouki再次親臨現場支持香港創科展，now please allow me to say a few words to David. David, I am so happy to see you again in today’s event. Thank you so much for your continuous support to Hong Kong’s innovation and technology development. I am confident that you are impressed by our young generation on their innovation and enthusiasm. I wish you a pleasant experience in today’s event and a wonderful stay in Hong Kong!

今年大會一共接獲近600份參賽作品，踴躍程度為歷年之冠。剛才我在參觀展區的時候，也深深感受到同學們的創意與熱情。今年的作品很多都聚焦社會需求，例如幫助弱勢群體的智能裝置、提升生活便利的環保設計，以及運用人工智能解決實際問題的方案，你們的作品不僅貼合「大想頭齊創新」的主題，同時充分體現了「科技向善」的理念。同學們將課堂所學到的科學知識與現實生活中的觀察相結合，並通過多次測試，把理論、數據和創新意念轉化為實體應用方案，這正是一個創科夢想由萌芽到茁壯的過程。

任何創新產品都必須通過嚴格的專業驗證和標準測試，才能推出市場並獲得消費者信任。今年創科展特別增設的「檢測和認證專項獎」正好加強學生理解檢測和認證在創科過程中的角色及重要性，希望同學們在激發創意的同時，將控制質量和標準的觀念融入設計當中，同時要注重產品的可靠性和安全性，以體現科技發展中「以人為本」的核心價值。我看到現場許多同學的作品已經展現出商品化的潛力，希望你們能繼續努力加以優化，讓創新意念真正服務社會。

香港正全速全力發展成為國際創新科技中心，特區政府在《香港創新科技發展藍圖》明確提出普及創科文化為八大發展策略之一。很多人覺得創科是科學家、研究員和科技專家的事，但其實創科也可以很「貼地」，與你我的日常生活也息息相關。我們希望通過更多像香港創科展的創科盛事和科普活動，提升社會的創新氛圍，並為年輕人提供一個讓創意萌芽生根的平台。

在此，我要特別感謝所有指導老師和家長，你們的支持和鼓勵是同學們不斷前進的動力。各位同學，創科之路充滿挑戰，但也充滿無限可能。請謹記：科技可以改變世界，而科技由你們掌握。希望你們保持這份衝勁和好奇心，繼續探索、不斷突破，為香港乃至全球的創科發展貢獻力量。

最後，我祝賀所有得獎隊伍，也感謝每一位參與的同學、老師和家長。讓我們攜手努力，共同書寫香港創科的新篇章。多謝大家！"
