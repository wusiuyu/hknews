SEE inspects enhanced preventive work in Wong Tai Sin against chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-10-27 22:44,2025-10-27 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700774.htm,"The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, accompanied by the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene, Mr Donald Ng; Assistant Director (Operations) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Mr Tsoi Ka-wai, and representatives from relevant departments, inspected the enhanced preventive work against chikungunya fever (CF) in Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin and the surrounding area this afternoon (October 27).

Mr Tse said Hong Kong recorded 18 locally acquired cases of dengue fever spread by mosquitoes in 2018. With the concerted mosquito prevention and control efforts by the government and various sectors, the transmission chain was successfully interrupted. He encouraged FEHD staff to intensify mosquito control measures to contain the spread of the CF.

FEHD officers briefed Mr Tse that the FEHD deployed officers today to inspect in the vicinity of the first local chikungunya fever case patient's residence and found mosquito breeding and stagnant water in a residential estate. As a result, they instituted a prosecution and issued a statutory notice to the relevant property management company in accordance with Section 27 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), requiring the company's responsible person to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. The FEHD also inspected nearby construction sites and found mosquito breeding and stagnant water, and hence instituted a prosecution and issued four statutory notices to the relevant contractors.

In addition, the FEHD has inspected schools, elderly homes, and childcare facilities in the surrounding area and has installed new mosquito traps in the relevant schools to further strengthen mosquito prevention and control.

Mr Tse said the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures. The Environment and Ecology Bureau convened the interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee special meeting to advise relevant departments to strengthen anti-mosquito measures in the areas under their purviews. The district offices of the FEHD will also hold interdepartmental meetings at the district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures.

He appealed to members of the public to fully support and co-operate with the Government's work, including seeking medical advice or contacting the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health if they had a fever, rash or joint pain. Members of the public should also inspect their homes; property management personnel should also inspect public areas within buildings and housing estates, such as flower beds, refuse rooms, and rooftops, to thoroughly eliminate stagnant water, preventing mosquito breeding.

While attending a continuing professional development seminar held by the Property Management Services Authority today, Mr Ng called on the industry to work hand in hand with the Government to enhance mosquito prevention and control measures within their managed properties."

There will be a total of 200 torchbearers, with 50 torchbearers in each city. The torch relay launching ceremony will be held at 9am that day in Shenzhen, followed by starting ceremonies in Hong Kong, Macao and Guangzhou at 9.30am, where torch relay will start simultaneously. Representatives of the four cities will return the flame to Guangzhou after the torch relay. A flame-gathering ceremony will be held at around 5pm in the Guangdong Olympic Sports Center, bridging the torch relay at the venue and the lighting of the main torch at the 15th NG opening ceremony.

 The Head of the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong), Mr Yeung Tak-keung, together with representatives from the Hong Kong Police Force and the Transport Department, held an interdepartmental press conference today (October 27) to give briefing on the route of torch relay in Hong Kong and the relevant transportation arrangements.

 Torch relay in Hong Kong will start at 9.30am on November 2. The total route length is approximately 10 kilometers, divided into five segments, with the running distance accounting for about 3.8 kilometers. Starting from the Central Government Offices in Tamar,the Hong Kong route passes through the Central and Western District Promenade (Central Section), the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade, the Monument in Commemoration of Return of Hong Kong to China and Golden Bauhinia Square. For the second section, torchbearers will cross the Victoria Harbour by Star Ferry and take part along the Tsim Sha Tsui route. They will start from Star Ferry Bus Terminus in Tsim Sha Tsui in Salisbury Road to Mody Lane, passing by the Hong Kong Cultural Centre and Hong Kong Museum of Art. Torchbearers of the fourth section will take an open-top bus to the bus terminal at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP). After entering KTSP, the torchbearers of the fifth section will pass by the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground and the Kai Tak Sports Avenue before arriving at the Kai Tak Sports Park Central Square. The last torchbearer will then light the cauldron and the closing ceremony will take place.

 To facilitate the holding of the torch relay, road sections of the Central and Western District Promenade (Central Section), Golden Bauhinia Square and Wan Chai Temporary Promenade will be temporarily closed during the event. Moreover, special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented by the Police and Transport Department during the event.

Road traffic control measures

During the torch relay, road closures and special traffic arrangements will be implemented in the areas of Wan Chai North, the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront, and around the Kai Tak Sports Park.

Restricted Flying Zone

 The Police will set up a temporary restricted flying zone (RFZ), extending two kilometres outwards from the route of the torch relay from 8.30am to 11.40am on November 2. No small unmanned aircraft, except those authorised, will be permitted to enter the zone. Details of the temporary RFZ will be shown on the electronic portal for small unmanned aircraft ""eSUA"".

Public transport arrangements

 To facilitate the temporary road closures and traffic control measures to be implemented by the Police at Wan Chai North and Tsim Sha Tsui on the morning of the Hong Kong leg of the 15th National Games torch relay, 52 franchised bus routes and five green minibus (GMB) routes operating in the affected road sections in the vicinity of Expo Drive East in Wan Chai, Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier Bus Terminus, Nathan Road and Salisbury Road will adjust their services starting from the first departure on that day. Among them, KMB Route No. 8P (Laguna Verde – Tsim Sha Tsui (Circular)) will be suspended. The remaining affected bus and GMB routes will require temporary diversion or suspension/relocation of relevant stops within the affected areas. Normal operations will resume gradually after roads reopen. Relevant public transport operators will issue notices to inform affected passengers of the service adjustment details.

 According to the route of the torch relay, the torch will be passed to the Kai Tak Sports Park via ferry and an open-top bus, with temporary control measures along the route. Subject to the actual situation, there may be temporary service adjustment from around 9.45am to 10.30am in the Wan Chai – Tsim Sha Tsui ferry route. In addition, the overall traffic at Wan Chai North, West Kowloon and East Kowloon will be busier. The Transport Department urges members of the public and visitors travelling to the affected areas to plan their trips in advance and allow sufficient time for their journeys. They are advised to use railway services as far as possible and avoid driving to the affected road sections.

ããMr Yeung said, the entire Hong Kong relay route is designed to highlight the unique cultural and sporting characteristics of the city. The torchbearers include representatives from various sectors, including sports, sponsors, volunteers, the youth, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities. The detailed list of torchbearers will be announced in due course. Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao cohosted a press conference in Guangzhou this morning. Mr Yeung addressed in the press conference that the biggest highlight of the 15th NG torch relay is the collaborative progress of the three places and the relay among the four cities. The unique feature of the joint hosting of the 15th NG by the three places has been fully demonstrated, from the lighting of the ""source flame"" in Nansha, Guangzhou by the representatives of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau earlier this month to the simultaneous torch relay events in four locations on November 2."
Update on chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-10-27 22:17,2025-10-27 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700766.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 27), the CHP has recorded three new cases of chikungunya fever (CF). The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest cases information
------------------------------
ãã The first case involves a 55-year-old female living in Wong Tai Sin. Following the first local case yesterday (October 26), the CHP conducted active case finding and noted that she is a staff of a school at Fung Tak Estate. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Shanwei in Guangdong between October 11 and 12. Several days after returning to Hong Kong, she visited Shenzhen in Guangdong alone on October 19. She developed a fever, rash and joint pain on October 24. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital yesterday evening. The CHP immediately arranged the patient for testing upon receiving notification. Her travel companions to Shanwei and three household contacts are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance. Since the patient stayed at two affected places (including Shenzhen and the vicinity of Fung Tak Estate), her source of infection has yet to be confirmed. The CHP will carry out genome analysis to ascertain whether it has epidemiological linkage with the confirmed local case yesterday. Investigation is ongoing.

The second case involves a 67-year-old male living in Tung Chung. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Foshan in Guangdong alone between September 29 and October 24. He developed a fever and joint pain on October 23. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of North Lantau Hospital the following day upon returning Hong Kong. He has three household contacts who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

ããThe third case involves a 76-year-old female living in Tseung Kwan O. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Guangzhou and Huizhou in Guangdong alone between October 17 and 26. She developed a fever and joint pain on October 22 and sought medical attention at a hospital in Guangdong. She returned to Hong Kong on October 26 and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital. She has two household contacts who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

ãã All three patients were admitted to the hospitals for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and are in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. Since the abovementioned 67-year-old male and 76-year-old female stayed in Guangdong Province during their incubation period, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigations are ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Government's comprehensive actions on prevention and control of CF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ãã The CHP is implementing prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. If they present with relevant symptoms, the CHP will arrange for laboratory testing. The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams (Care Teams) have distributed questionnaires and promotional leaflets to about 8 000 households in the district, and will continue to contact the residents, disseminate information, and understand and follow up their health conditions. The CHP has also issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and remaining them to be vigilant.
ãã ã

ãã The CHP and Wong Tai Sin District Office (WTSDO) organised a public health talk at the at Fung Tak Estate Community Centre at 8pm tonight to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others. Besides, the online seminar held by the CHP last night attracted over 4 100 total views.

ãã In addition, the CHP has set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and a health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre from yesterday, where assessments have been provided to residents with relevant symptoms. As at 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessment for about 1 300 residents, with seven individuals presenting relevant symptoms received blood tests. While awaiting laboratory results, they will follow the CHP's advice to use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients for effective prevention of mosquito bites. The hotline and health consultation booth will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily.

ãã The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year. In fact, overall mosquito infestation indices this year are lower than that of the previous years. The mosquito infestation index in September was 2.5 per cent, which decreased significantly from 9.5 per cent in June. The index available for October also remains at a low level. Regarding the investigation area of the local case, the latestarea gravidtrap index (AGI) in October was 1.7 per cent, while the AGI in September was 0.9 per cent, indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive. Among which, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, these measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


ãã The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures. The Environment and Ecology Bureau held Steering Committee meeting this afternoon to lead relevant departments to step up mosquito prevention and elimination measures; the district offices of the FEHD will hold interdepartmental meetings at district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------

âãã Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

ãã According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 868 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 19 to 25), showing a decrease compared to the previous week (October 12 to 18), which reported 2 086 cases. Most of the cases (199 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (130 cases), Guangzhou (124 cases) and Shenzhen (102 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.


Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

ãã Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

ãã Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
ãã The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

ãã To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

ãã The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況（附圖）,2025-10-27 21:39,2025-10-27 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700696.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十七日）下午五時，中心錄得三宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

最新個案資料
——————

首宗個案涉及一名55歲女子，住所位於黃大仙。昨日（十月二十六日）確診首宗本地個案後，中心透過主動查找懷疑個案時，得悉該個案是鳳德邨一間學校一名員工。初步調查顯示，她於十月十一日至十二日到訪廣東省汕尾市，返港數天後，再於十月十九日獨自到訪廣東省深圳市。她於十月二十四日出現發燒、皮疹及關節痛，昨日傍晚到廣華醫院急症室求醫，中心接獲通報後即時安排患者進行檢測。與她一同行到訪汕尾市的人士及她的三名家居接觸者暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。由於患者在潛伏期內曾在兩個受影響地點（包括深圳市及鳳德邨範圍）活動，她的感染源頭有待確定，中心會對病毒進行基因分析，以判斷是否與昨天確診的本地個案有流行病學關連，調查仍在進行中。

第二宗個案涉及一名67歲男子，住所位於東涌。初步調查顯示，他於九月二十九日至十月二十四日獨自到訪廣東省佛山市。他於十月二十三日出現發燒及關節痛，翌日回港到北大嶼山醫院急症室求醫。他有三名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

第三宗個案涉及一名76歲女子，住所位於將軍澳。初步調查顯示，她於十月十七日至二十六日獨自到訪廣東省廣州市及惠州市。她於十月二十二日出現發燒及關節痛，於當地醫院求醫。她於十月二十六日回港，並到將軍澳醫院急症室求醫。她有兩名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

三名病人均獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定，他們的血液樣本均對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。由於上述67歲男子及76歲女子於潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

政府全方位防控基孔肯雅熱

中心正按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為個案的家居接觸者或共同暴露於感染源頭的人士提供醫學監察及健康建議，如他們出現相關病徵，中心會安排化驗檢測。中心人員和當區關愛隊已向當區約八千戶民居派發問卷及宣傳單張，並會繼續聯絡居民發放資訊，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心亦已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

今日晚上八時，中心和黃大仙民政事務處在鳳德社區中心合辦教育講座，以期加深市民對這種蚊傳疾病的認識，一同參與防控工作，護己護人。而中心昨晚舉行的網上講座，總觀看人次超過4 100。

另外，中心由昨日起設立熱線（電話：2125 2373）及在鳳德商場二樓設立醫護站，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估。截至今日下午五時，中心已為約1 300居民作評估，其中七名出現相關症狀的市民接受抽血檢查，等候化驗結果期間，他們會按中心建議，使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊。熱線及醫護站會繼續每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。事實上，今年整體蚊患指數較往年為低，九月份的蚊患指數為2.5%，較六月份高峰的9.5%明顯下降，而十月份已有的指數亦同樣處於低水平。在這個本地個案的調查區域，最新十月的分區指數為1.7%，九月的指數為0.9%，顯示白紋伊蚊分布並不廣泛。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。環境及生態局今日下午已召開督導委員會會議，指導各相關部門在其所屬範疇內加強防蚊滅蚊；食環署各分區辦事處亦會在地區層面召開跨部門會議，進行風險評估，並落實各項針對性措施。


最新監測數據
——————

​自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

 根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月十九日至二十五日）廣東省新增868宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十月十二日至十八日）的2 086宗顯著下降。上周大部分個案（199宗）在江門巿錄得，其次為佛山（130宗）、廣州（124宗）及深圳（102宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。

Special meeting of Pest Control Steering Committee convened to strengthen interdepartmental preventive work against chikungunya fever (with photo),2025-10-27 20:20,2025-10-27 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700644.htm,"In response to the first locally acquired case of chikungunya fever (CF) recorded yesterday (October 26), the Environment and Ecology Bureau convened the interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee (PCSC) special meeting today (October 27), to urge relevant departments to strengthen anti-mosquito measures in the areas under their purviews. The district offices of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will also hold interdepartmental meetings at the district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures.

In the special meeting, the PCSC was briefed by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health, the FEHD, the Home Affairs Department (HAD), the Housing Department (HD), etc. regarding the first local CF case, and discussed further measures to prevent CF from taking root locally and urged departments to strengthen mosquito elimination work in areas under their purviews.

Details of the local CF case

Representatives from the CHP explained to the attendees the details of the local CF case and the CHP's risk assessment. As at October 26, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 47 CF cases this year, including one local case recorded yesterday and 46 imported cases. Except for one male patient with chronic diseases who passed away, the remaining cases were with mild symptoms. The CHP recorded the first local CF case on October 26. Given that the activity areas of the local case patient are primarily within Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin, the CHP cannot rule out the possibility that unidentified infected patient(s) in the area may have transmitted the virus to mosquitoes in the estate, leading to her infection.

In light of the first local case, the CHP will initiate infection control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong. This includes providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. The CHP will arrange for laboratory testing if they presented with relevant symptoms. Besides carrying out questionnaire surveys, the CHP has set up a health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre, where assessments will be provided to residents with relevant symptoms from yesterday. The CHP has also set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and conducted online and physical seminars.

The CHP, together with the FEHD, have inspected various locations in the vicinity of patient's residence, conducted vector investigations and mosquito control operations to minimise the risk of local transmission. Furthermore, the CHP has issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to stay vigilant.

Prevent the spread of CF

In the meeting, the representative of the FEHD reported to the PCSC the situation of mosquito proliferation since the beginning of this year. The overall gravidtrap indices (GI) for Aedes albopictus from July to September 2025 (8.1 per cent in July, 5.3 per cent in August and 2.5 per cent in September) were below 10 per cent and remained at a relatively low level.

The FEHD also reported to the PCSC the situation of mosquito infestation in the investigation area of the local case, as well as follow-up actions have been, or will be done, by the FEHD in response to the local case including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


 To prevent the spread of CF, the FEHD has been proactively implementing the following mosquito prevention and control measures:


Convening special meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to co-ordinate frontline departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito control, and to allocate resources to carry out targeted and sustained mosquito control actions based on the GI and locations with higher risks;
Enhancing inspections at construction sites, works areas and private residences. Enforcement actions will be taken against violations involving mosquito breeding;
Collaborating with departments such as the HD and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) to strengthen inspections in public areas, public housing estates and parks. Upon detection of mosquito breeding grounds, immediate actions will be taken;
Inviting the HD and property management companies to conduct mosquito control campaigns in housing estates and encourage resident participation;
Working with the District Offices to assist in mosquito prevention and control at locations with infestation issues, such as ""three-nil"" buildings;
Issuing letters to the property management and pest control industry to remind them the implementation of mosquito prevention and control measures, and organising seminars to disseminate the latest information on CFand mosquito prevention.The Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene today reminded the property management trade to properly carry out mosquito control measures in venues under their management;
Strengthening inspections of schools and facilities for the elderly and children, reminding and assisting them in mosquito prevention;
Strengthening public education and publicity through promotional videos, posters and leaflets to remind the public to adopt mosquito control measures; and
Enhancing dissemination of the area GI for Aedes albopictus to raise awareness among citizens in districts with higher readings.


During the Chung Yeung Festival period, the FEHD will enhance the cleaning and mosquito prevention efforts at public cemeteries and columbaria. The FEHD urged the public to co-operate by clearing stagnant water and refuse after tomb-sweeping to prevent mosquito breeding. Containers such as lunch boxes, drink cans, plastic bags and buckets for burning incense should also be removed. Furthermore, managers of private cemeteries have also been notified and urged to implement corresponding mosquito prevention measures.

The Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, and the Chairperson of the PCSC, Miss Diane Wong, urged at the meeting all departments to contact their stakeholders to initiate appropriate infection control measures with a view to preventing the further spread of CF. The FEHD also urged all departments to further strengthen anti-mosquito measures and carry out intensive mosquito control operations in areas under their purview. In additions, inspections will be conducted on a sampling basis, situations that worth concern will be reported to senior management, aiming to ensure that the mosquito infestation is properly addressed.

The Government also urged members of the community to stay vigilant and carry out personal protective measures, as well as implement mosquito control measures at their household, work place and nearby environment, so as to prevent further transmission of CF.

The meeting today was chaired by Miss Wong. Government bureaux, departments and organisations attending the meeting were the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department; the Architectural Services Department; the Civil Engineering and Development Department; the Development Bureau; the Department of Health; the Drainage Services Department; the Education Bureau; the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department; the Environmental Protection Department; the FEHD; the Government Property Agency; the Hospital Authority; the HAD; the HD; the Highways Department; the Information Services Department; the Lands Department; the LCSD; the Marine Department; the Social Welfare Department and the Water Supplies Department."
防治蟲鼠督導委員會召開特別會議　加強跨部門防控基孔肯雅熱（附圖）,2025-10-27 19:42,2025-10-27 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700606.htm,"因應本港昨日（十月二十六日）錄得首宗感染基孔肯雅熱的本地個案，環境及生態局今日（十月二十七日）召開政府跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會（委員會）特別會議，敦促各相關部門在其所屬範疇內加強防蚊滅蚊；食物環境衞生署（食環署）各分區辦事處亦會在地區層面召開跨部門會議，進行風險評估，並落實各項針對性措施。

委員會在特別會議上就首宗本地基孔肯雅熱感染個案聽取了衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）、食環署、民政事務總署（民政總署）、房屋署等匯報，並商討進一步的措施，以全力防止基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根，以及促請各部門在其管轄範疇內加強滅蚊工作。

本地基孔肯雅熱感染個案詳情

中心代表向各與會者講述本地基孔肯雅熱感染個案的詳情及其風險評估。本港今年（截至十月二十六日）累計錄得47宗基孔肯雅熱個案。當中包括於十月二十六日錄得的1宗本地個案及46宗輸入個案。除了一名有長期病患的男患者病逝之外，其餘個案均為輕症。中心於十月二十六日錄得首宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案。鑑於患者的活動範圍主要局限於黃大仙鳳德邨內，因此，中心不排除有未確診的患者在區內，將病毒傳播給邨內的蚊蟲，導致患者受感染。

針對首宗本地個案，中心會聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取跟進防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響，包括為個案的家居接觸者或共同暴露於感染源頭的人士提供醫學監察及健康建議，如他們出現相關病徵，中心會安排化驗檢測。除進行問卷調查外，中心於十月二十六日起在鳳德商場二樓設醫護站，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估，亦已設立查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373），以及舉行網上及實體教育講座。

中心亦已聯同食環署人員實地視察患者家居一帶的地點，進行病媒調查及滅蚊，減低本地傳播的風險。此外，中心已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

防止基孔肯雅熱傳播

在會議上，食環署代表向委員會匯報今年初至今的蚊患情況。二○二五年七月至九月的整體白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數（七月為8.1%；八月為5.3%及九月為2.5%），全部指數均低於10%，保持在較低水平。

另外，食環署亦向委員會匯報本地個案的調查區域的蚊患情況，以及食環署針對本地個案已採取或將會採取的跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑和清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


為防範基孔肯雅熱的傳播，食環署積極採取以下防控蚊患措施：


在各分區召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」特別會議，協調前線部門及各持份者加強滅蚊，根據指數或風險較高的地點，調配資源採取具針對性和持久性的防蚊滅蚊行動；
加強巡查建築地盤及工地，以及私人住宅，對發現蚊子滋生的違規情況採取執法行動；
聯同房屋署及康樂及文化事務署等不同部門在公共地方、公共屋邨、公園等加強巡查，如發現蚊子滋生地，會即時採取行動；
邀請房屋署及物業管理公司在屋邨及屋苑進行滅蚊運動，並鼓勵居民參與；
聯同各區民政事務處，協助有蚊蟲滋生情況的地方如「三無大廈」進行防蚊滅蚊工作；
已向物業管理及防治蟲鼠業界發信，提醒業界落實防治蚊患的措施，以及通過舉辦講座，向業界講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況及防蚊資訊，包括食環署署長今日與物管業界的會面中，亦再次提醒大家須做好其負責範圍的防蚊滅蚊工作；
加強巡查學校以及長者和幼兒設施，提醒和協助他們防蚊；
持續加強公眾教育及宣傳，通過宣傳短片、海報及單張等途徑，提醒市民採取措施防治蚊患；及
加強發布各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，提升指數較高地區市民的防蚊意識。


重陽節期間，食環署會加強轄下各公眾墳場及骨灰安置所的潔淨及防治蚊患工作，並呼籲市民合作，掃墓後要清除積水及清理垃圾，避免蚊蟲滋生；飯盒、飲品罐、膠袋及化寶鐵桶等容器亦要妥善清理；亦已通知私人墳場負責人，促請他們採取相應的防蚊措施。

環境及生態局副局長兼委員會主席黃淑嫻在會上促請政府各部門與其持份者聯絡，採取適當防控措施，以防止基孔肯雅熱進一步蔓延。食環署亦在會上呼籲各部門在其管轄的範圍內，進一步加強防治蚊患工作和進行密集式滅蚊的工作。食環署會抽樣進行視察並將值得關注的情況向高層匯報，務求令蚊患情況獲得適切處理。

政府亦呼籲市民大眾不要掉以輕心，必須做好個人防護措施，以及家居、工作及附近環境的防蚊滅蚊措施，以防止基孔肯雅熱進一步蔓延。

今日的會議由黃淑嫻主持，出席的決策局、政府部門及機構代表有：漁農自然護理署、建築署、土木工程拓展署、發展局、衞生署、渠務署、教育局、機電工程署、環境保護署、食環署、政府產業署、醫院管理局、民政總署、房屋署、路政署、政府新聞處、地政總署、康樂及文化事務署、海事處、社會福利署和水務署。"

清潔服務公司持牌人因僱用非法勞工被判入獄,2025-10-27 19:05,2025-10-27 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700595.htm,"一名清潔服務公司持牌人因僱用不可合法受僱的人被定罪，於上星期四（十月二十三日）在沙田裁判法院被判入獄六個月。

入境事務處（入境處）調查人員於二○二三年三月二十九日的反非法勞工行動中，在觀塘一個住宅屋苑內拘捕兩名從事清潔工作的非法勞工。該兩名被捕非法勞工為越南籍女子，年齡為四十三及五十歲。其中一名越南籍女子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），另一名越南籍女子則為非法入境者。該兩名非法勞工早前在沙田裁判法院被判入獄，分別被判監禁十五及十六個月。

跟進調查發現該兩名非法勞工均受僱於同一清潔服務公司，調查人員其後拘捕該清潔服務公司的持牌人。該持牌人為一名香港永久性居民男子，年齡為四十九歲，他因並未在聘用僱員前採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱，被控兩項「僱用不可合法受僱的人」的控罪。經審訊後，兩項控罪均被判監禁四個月，部分刑期同期執行。他於上星期四（十月二十三日）在沙田裁判法院合共被判監禁六個月。

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

Cleaning service company licensee jailed for employing illegal workers,2025-10-27 19:05,2025-10-27 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700596.htm,"  A cleaning service company licensee was convicted of charges of being an employer of a person who was not lawfully employable and was jailed for six months by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts last Thursday (October 23).

  During an anti-illegal workers operation conducted by the Immigration Department (ImmD) on March 29, 2023, two Vietnamese females, aged 43 and 50, were arrested for working as cleaning workers in a residential estate at Kwun Tong. Among them, one Vietnamese woman was a holder of a recognisance form, which prohibits her from taking any employment and another Vietnamese woman was an illegal immigrant. The illegal workers were jailed by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts earlier and were sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months and 16 months respectively.

  A further investigation revealed that the illegal workers were employed by the same cleaning service company, and thus the licensee of the cleaning service company was arrested. The licensee is a Hong Kong permanent resident, male, aged 49. He is charged with two counts of ""employing a person who is not lawfully employable"" as he did not take all practicable steps to ascertain whether the applicant was lawfully employable prior to employment. After the trial, the licensee was sentenced to four months of imprisonment on both charges, with part of the sentencesto run consecutively, resulting in a total of six months' imprisonment by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts last Thursday (October 23).

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

Brian (Co-Chief Executive of The Bank of East Asia, Limited (BEA), Mr Brian Li), Adrian (Co-Chief Executive of BEA, Mr Adrian Li), Mr Haagmann (member of the Executive Board of Union Investment, Mr André Haagmann), Janet (Chief Executive Officer of BEA Union Investment, Ms Janet Li), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my great honour to address you today at BEA Union Investment's 18th Anniversary Celebration. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to BEA Union Investment for hosting this distinguished gathering and for your remarkable 18 years of outstanding performance in serving Hong Kong's asset management sector. It is a privilege to join you in celebrating this milestone, and to reflect on the bright future ahead for Hong Kong's asset and wealth management industry.

Hong Kong's strength in asset and wealth management

 Over the past years, we have witnessed remarkable performance for the asset and wealth management sector of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has firmly established itself as Asia's leading fund management hub, with our asset and wealth management business reaching an impressive HK$35 trillion last year, equivalent to 11 times of our GDP (Gross Domestic Product). This growth was driven by an 81 per cent surge in net fund inflows, fueled by facilitating policies that have attracted new capital for management in our city. Notably, 54 per cent of these assets were sourced from investors outside the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong, reinforcing our status as an international wealth management hub. This momentum has continued into this year, with Hong Kong-domiciled SFC (Securities and Futures Commission)-authorised funds recording net inflows of HK$270 billion in the first half of the year. Also, in the latest Global Financial Centres Index, Hong Kong maintained the top three positions globally in the ""banking"", ""investment management"", ""insurance"" and ""finance"" sectors, underscoring our position as Asia's premier asset and wealth management hub as recognised by international investors.

 The robust fund management ecosystem in Hong Kong is a cornerstone of our ambition as a global financial centre, attracting diverse capital and expertise that promote economic growth and innovation. The presence of world-class fund managers strengthens our position as a centre for international investment, connecting Asia with global markets. Our city is home to over 650 private equity firms, managing over US$230 billion in capital as of June this year, making Hong Kong the second-largest private equity hub in Asia. Also, Hong Kong hosts at least 2 700 single family offices, and we are Asia's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre. Market research indicates that we are on track to become the global leader for cross-boundary wealth management in a few years' time.

Progressive regulatory reforms on asset and wealth management

 Our regulatory framework continues to evolve in support of this vibrant industry. In February this year, regulators issued a circular clarifying requirements for authorising closed-ended funds that invest mainly in private and less liquid assets, such as private equity, private credit, and infrastructure equity or debt. This encourages sizable alternative asset funds, particularly those with regular income streams, to list in Hong Kong. Additionally, the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Schemes Authority clarified in May this year that MPF funds may invest in approved listed private equity funds, providing greater flexibility in their fund allocation choices.

 To enhance operational efficiency, regulators have issued a circular to streamline suitability assessments for sophisticated professional investors. This initiative simplifies processes, improves client experiences, and facilitates more seamless transactions, ensuring that sophisticated professional investors can operate and allocate assets with agility in our dynamic market. These measures reflect Hong Kong's unwavering commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment catering to the needs of global wealth management.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate BEA Union Investment once again on 18 years of excellence and leadership in Hong Kong's wealth management industry. Your success is a testament to the strength and dynamism of our financial ecosystem. Hong Kong's forward-thinking policies and strategic vision position our city as the ultimate destination for wealth management. I invite global investors, family offices, and financial institutions to leverage our robust platform to achieve their wealth preservation and growth objectives. Together, let us continue to build a vibrant and prosperous future for Hong Kong as the world's leading wealth management hub.

 Before I conclude, I encourage all financial market participants to actively participate in the coming Legislative Council General Election on December 7 by casting your votes. It is of utmost importance for accelerating the development of Hong Kong's economy and our markets. Thank you."
Public and visitors urged to plan cross-boundary trips early for Chung Yeung Festival holiday,2025-10-27 17:54,2025-10-27 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700524.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (October 27) said that, in anticipation of a large number of members of the public, vehicles and Mainland visitors travelling between Hong Kong and the Mainland or Macao via various land-based boundary control points (BCPs) during the Chung Yeung Festival holiday (October 29), the public and visitors are urged to plan their trips early and allow sufficient travelling time.

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators (PTOs) to strengthen their services on that day, including:


Increasing the frequency of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) shuttle bus (Gold Bus) to an average of about one minute during peak hours, if needed;
Increasing the frequency of the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to an average of about two minutes during peak hours, if needed;
Increasing the quota of cross-boundary coaches to strengthen services;
The frequency of local franchised bus B routes connecting various land-based BCPs will also be increased to a level higher than that of normal weekends, and the operators concerned will reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet passenger demand; and
The MTR Corporation Limited will enhance the train services of the East Rail Line between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau at different times on that day to provide convenience for the travelling public and visitors.


  It is anticipated that the waiting time for public transport services including the Gold Bus and the franchised bus B routes may be longer. Passengers should make their journeys during non-peak hours, observe order while queuing and heed advice from on-site Police and staff of PTOs concerned. Passengers of cross-boundary coaches are also advised to reserve their coach tickets in advance.

  Of note, motorists are advised that, subject to actual traffic conditions, special traffic arrangements may be implemented at the Lok Ma Chau Control Point and the Shenzhen Bay Port on that day to allow smooth access for public transport vehicles to the above control points. Cross-boundary private cars may need to queue up for crossing the BCPs. Motorists should pay extra attention to variable message signs and traffic signs along the roads. In case of traffic congestion, they should remain patient and follow the instructions of on-site Police.

  For the HZMB, to plan their journeys ahead, members of the public can make use of the TD's HKeMobility mobile app or website (hkemobility.gov.hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access snapshots of traffic conditions at inbound and outbound vehicle plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port. They can also check real-time situations of the vehicle clearance plaza of the Zhuhai Port through the WeChat official accounts ""hzmbzhport"" or ""zhuhaifabu"" (traffic-info.gzazhka.com:5015/#/) (Chinese only). Moreover, motorists are reminded to always comply with the traffic control measures implemented by the Zhuhai authority when driving on the HZMB Main Bridge. Vehicles shall not occupy the emergency lane unless instructed by the Zhuhai authority.

  The public and visitors may visit the one-stop information platform on immigration clearance ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound) launched by the Security Bureau or the TD's HKeMobility mobile app for the latest information on various land-based BCPs more conveniently. The TD will provide information on the service and waiting time of the Gold Bus, the Yellow Bus and MTR on the platform. Members of the public are advised to check the latest traffic news through radio and television broadcasts, the TD's website and the HKeMobility."

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-10-27 16:45,2025-10-27 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700494.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（十月二十七日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十月十九日至二十五日期間，衞生防護中心錄得三宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案。詳情如下：


83歲女病人，有長期病患，居於東區；
54歲男病人，過往健康良好，居於元朗區；及
75歲男病人，有長期病患，居於東區。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這三宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至十月二十五日，今年錄得135宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-10-27 16:45,2025-10-27 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700495.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 27) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From October 19 to 25, the CHP recorded three community-acquired LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


an 83-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Eastern District;
a 54-year-old male patient with good past health living in Yuen Long District; and
a 75-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Eastern District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these three cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of October 25, 135 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

â
âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

Hong Kong Customs detects two smuggling cases involving river trade vessel and ocean-going vessel with goods worth about $200 million seized (with photo),2025-10-27 16:40,2025-10-27 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700510.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected two suspected smuggling cases involving a river trade vessel and an ocean-going vessel on October 3 and 7 respectively. Large batches of suspected smuggled goods with a total estimated market value of about $200 million were seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, a river trade vessel departing from Hong Kong for Macao was selected for inspection on October 3. Upon examination, Customs officers aboard the vessel found a large batch of suspected smuggled goods, including suspected controlled shark fins, cigars, mobile phones and suspected pharmaceutical products.

Moreover, Customs officers inspected five containers that were scheduled to be shipped to Taiwan and declared as carrying frozen food on October 7 and found 150 tonnes of donkey skin in the five containers upon examination.
Investigations are ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Being a government department primarily responsible for tackling smuggling activities, Customs has long been combating various smuggling activities at the forefront. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on relevant crimes.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

評論

政府發言人表示，九月商品出口貨值繼續顯著增長，按年上升16.1%。輸往內地和大部分其他亞洲市場的出口蓬勃增長，輸往美國和歐盟的出口亦溫和增長。同時，大部分主要商品的出口上升，尤其是電動設備、機械及機械用具的出口繼續強勁增長。

展望未來，環球經濟持續擴張，應會繼續支持香港的商品貿易表現。政府一直致力加深香港與不同市場的經貿聯繫亦有幫助。然而，美國貿易政策將繼續為國際貿易流向的短期前景帶來不確定性。政府會密切監察情況，並保持警覺。

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that the value of merchandise exports continued to grow visibly by 16.1% in September over a year earlier. Exports to the Mainland and most other Asian markets saw robust growth, and exports to the United States and the European Union also grew moderately. Meanwhile, exports of most major commodities increased, particularly for exports of electrical equipment, machinery and mechanical appliances which continued to see strong growth.

  Looking ahead, Hong Kong's merchandise trade performance should continue to be underpinned by the sustained expansion in the global economy. The Government's ongoing endeavour in enhancing economic and trade ties with different markets also helps. Yet, the United States' trade policy will continue to cast uncertainties on the near-term outlook of international trade flows. The Government will monitor the situation closely and stay vigilant.

The Hospital Authority (HA) held the ""Health in Your Hand - HA Go Just One Click Away"" campaign launching ceremony today (October 27), marking the beginning of a new large-scale promotional initiative to encourage the public to download the HA Go mobile application for easier access to public hospital services.

The launching ceremony took place at the HA Head Office and across seven hospital clusters. During the ceremony, the HA Chairman, Mr Henry Fan, presented designated uniforms to the representatives of the HA Go volunteer team. The latest promotional video for HA Go was also premiered at the event, aiming to enhance the public's understanding of the diverse functions of HA Go, enabling them to manage their health with just one click.

The HA Chief Executive, Dr Libby Lee, said, ""Since its launch in 2019, HA Go has been well-received by the public. With HA Go, citizens can access various public hospital services more conveniently, quickly and smoothly, while also helping them manage their personal and family health more effectively. We will continue to enhance the functions of HA Go, aiming to make it an essential 'health manager' on every citizen's smartphone.""

As of the third quarter of this year, HA Go has recorded over 4.12 million downloads, with more than 3.25 million registered full members and over 370 000 registered carers.

Mr Fan said, ""The HA's promotion of HA Go marks a significant milestone in the development of Hong Kong's public healthcare services.""

Mr Fan added, Hong Kong is advancing from stability to prosperity. I urge citizens not only to download and use HA Go, but also to care about Hong Kong's future. Let us fulfill our civic responsibilities by voting in the Legislative Council General Election on December 7, electing capable LegCo members to jointly promote the development of Hong Kong and build a better public healthcare system together.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 24 to noon today (October 27), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 347 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website

The application deadline is February 28, 2026.

The QESS is a major support measure to promote the healthy and sustainable development of the self-financing post-secondary education sector, with the aim of enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the sector. It accepts applications under three project categories, namely theme-based projects, open-ended projects and industrial attachment projects.

Applicants in the category of theme-based projects may set their own themes, provided that the projects are conducted in a collaborative manner, i.e. planned and undertaken by more than one eligible institution, to foster closer collaboration and synergy among institutions and benefit the sector as widely as possible.

The applicants in the category of open-ended projects need to submit applications in relation to the relevant areas of the QESS funding. The main areas include:

(1) improving the overall learning experience and language proficiency of students;

(2) developing and improving teaching methodologies and practices, including the development of assessment strategies;

(3) strengthening and improving quality assurance and related measures; and

(4) enhancing student support and career guidance services, including support for non-Chinese speaking students and students with special educational needs.

As regards the category of industrial attachment projects, applicants can submit proposals within the following areas:

(1) incorporating quality assured work-based learning and assessments into programme curricula through close partnerships with industries;

(2) sourcing more industrial attachment opportunities within and/or outside Hong Kong, and/or enhancement of relevant institutional support for students; and

(3) organising visits or short-term training/courses conducted within and/or outside Hong Kong for students, which are directly relevant to industrial attachments.

All non-profit-making education institutions offering full-time locally accredited self-financing sub-degree or bachelor's degree (including top-up degree) programmes are eligible to apply. Other related bodies such as the federations of these education institutions and quality assurance agencies may also apply. All applications will be considered by the Sub-committee on Support Measures established under the Committee on Self-financing Post-secondary Education.

Since its launch in 2012, the QESS has approved over 120 projects with a total grant of about $455 million. In the 2024/25 round of applications, five out of 33 applications were approved, with a total earmarked grant of about $23 million, which aim to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced teaching resource hub for the sector; develop an AI-powered virtual laboratory platform for healthcare education; establish an industry-university partnerships office; enhance students' emotional wellness and resilience; and provide non-local students with holistic support.

Further details of the QESS, including the scope of various project categories and the application procedures, are available at the Concourse for Self-financing Post-secondary Education (www.cspe.edu.hk/en/qess-project.html)."

  An FEHD spokesman said that the annual FMP New Year Fair will be held for 15 consecutive days from February 17 to March 3 next year. A total of 21 dry goods stalls and six wet goods stalls will be put up for auction, with upset prices of $780 and $770 respectively.

  The open auction will be held at the Assembly Hall, 2/F, Lai Chi Kok Government Offices, 19 Lai Wan Road, Lai Chi Kok, Kowloon, on November 10 (Monday), from 2pm until the completion of the auction.

  Bidders for FMP New Year Fair stalls must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. Anyone can bid for more than one stall. A bidder must pay the bid price and register in person with his or her own name as the licensee of the stall immediately after successfully bidding for a stall. The bidder is also required to sign at once a licence agreement with the FEHD, or he/she will forfeit the rights to operate the stall.

  The FMP New Year Fair will be made available to the licensees three days in advance of the fair (from February 14 to 16, 2026) for the setting up of stalls. In the event of any unforeseeable incident that will cause a reduction of the whole licence period (including the duration for setting up stalls and the business period of the fair), the Government has the right to postpone the commencement date and shorten the duration of the period. The bidding price (licence fee) paid will be refunded to the successful bidder on a pro-rata basis without interest.

  The FEHD reminded licensees that the stalls are solely for the purpose of selling and promoting the sale of the permitted commodities, and no other activities are allowed in the licensed area. If the FEHD considers that any activity conducted by the licensee to publicise, promote, display, show, sell or gift any permitted commodities in the venue is unlawful, contrary to the interest of national security, immoral or incompatible with the object of the FMP New Year fair, the FEHD is entitled to direct the licensee to stop conducting such activity and the licensee must immediatelycomply with such direction.

  Stall licensees should not destroy, damage or abandon any unsold commodities at or in the vicinity of the stall. They must completely remove the stall structure and all paraphernalia, together with all refuse, debris and unsold commodities (whether damaged or not) before 6pm on March 3, 2026.

  According to the licence agreement, except inside designated stalls, licensees must not keep, store or use any compressed helium cylinders in the licenced area. Whereas licensees of the designated stalls may keep, store or use helium cylinders in the licenced area, the quantity of helium should be such that a licence is not required pursuant to the Dangerous Goods (Application and Exemption) Regulation 2012 (Cap. 295E), i.e. equivalent to 150 litres of helium. Sales of floating LED glowing balloons and aquarium fish by stall licensees are prohibited at the FMP Fair.

  In addition, as stated in the licence agreement, the height of dry goods stalls must not exceed three metres from ground level. The height ofwet goods stalls must not exceed 4.5m from ground level. For wet goods stalls with a height of more than 3m from ground level, the licensee must, at their own cost, provide the FEHD with the original certificate issued by an authorised person, a registered structural engineer, or a competent person under the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations (Cap. 59I) to certify the structural safety of the structure in the licensed area before the fair is opened to the public. The licensee must also affix a copy of the aforesaid certificate on the structure of the stall. Also, each corner and anchor point of the marquee (if any) shall be securely fastened using appropriate ballast weights, such as sandbags or purpose-designed marquee water weights. During the period when the Strong Monsoon Signal is in force or is to be issued, the licensee shall immediately inspect the stall and adopt reinforcement measures as necessary.

  Successful bidders shall comply with all the stipulations and provisions set out in the licence agreement. Otherwise, the department is entitled to terminate the agreement and the licensee shall immediately vacate the stall.

  Details of the 2026 FMP New Year Fair, such as the public notice, the location and layout of the fair venue, commodities allowed for sale at the fair stalls, open auction arrangements and relevant rules, and a sample of the licence agreement, are available on the FEHD's website (www.fehd.gov.hk).

"LCSD to hold vocal lecture series ""The Human Voice in 4 Parts"" in January next year",2025-10-27 14:30,2025-10-27 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700288.htm,"  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department will launch a vocal lecture series entitled ""The Human Voice in 4 Parts"" on four consecutive Wednesdays in January next year. Curated and hosted by voice pedagogue Chan Siu-kwan, each of the four lectures will feature one of the four main voice types (namely bass, alto, soprano and tenor) in Western classical music. Accompanied by selected excepts from Western opera works, the speaker will examine the roles portrayed by each voice type, and introduce the respective iconic legends along with their vocal features, guiding audiences to understand and appreciate the unique charm of different voice types.

  Details of each lecture are as follows:

Lecture 1: Bass
-----------------------
Date: January 7 (Wednesday)

  Two of the lowest male voice types are the bass and the baritone. In this lecture, drawing on performance excerpts of renowned singers such as baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky and bass Boris Christoff, the speaker will analyse the moments when these two voice types assign to take the leading male roles in opera.

Lecture 2: Alto
-----------------------
Date: January 14 (Wednesday)

  The speaker will examine why mezzo-sopranos and altos are often cast as supporting roles such as mothers, ladies-in-waiting or villainesses in opera, alongside the moments when these two voice types assume leading roles. This lecture will also introduce the ""castrati"", a dark chapter in music history, and the countertenors.

Lecture 3: Soprano
-----------------------
Date: January 21 (Wednesday)

  Through a selection of compelling excerpts, the speaker will explore why female leads in opera are predominantly performed by sopranos. Recordings of celebrated performances by divas such as Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland will be presented to illustrate what composers expect of the prima donna.

Lecture 4: Tenor
-----------------------
Date: January 28 (Wednesday)

  In the Romantic period, male leads in opera are mainly dominated by tenors. By featuring treasured recordings of Nicolai Gedda and Luciano Pavarotti, who was hailed as the ""King of High-Cs"", among others, this lecture will delve into the unique charm of the tenor voice.

  Chan is an eminent vocalist and expert in choral singing in Hong Kong. She currently teaches voice at the music departments of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Baptist University. She also serves as the vocal advisor of the Hong Kong Children's Choir. Chan often gives vocal masterclasses, and conducts vocal workshops for singers and choir conductors, in addition to serving as adjudicator in singing competitions.

  All lectures will be conducted in Cantonese and will start at 7.30pm at the Lecture Hall of the Hong Kong Space Museum. Each lecture will run for about one hour and 30 minutes.

âThe Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson today (October 27) announced that a total of 15 Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs), including Family Medicine Integrated Centres (FMICs), will provide public holiday Family Medicine Outpatient Services on the Chung Yeung Festival holiday (October 29) (see table below). Members of the public can make appointments through the telephone appointment system or the ""Book FMC"" function on the ""HA Go"" mobile application.

As influenza activity remains at a high level, the HA spokesperson appeals to members of the public to receive vaccinations early. Public hospitals and outpatient clinics of the HA have started providing seasonal influenza vaccinations to eligible persons to dovetail with the Government Vaccination Programme 2025/26. Eligible patients may receive vaccinations at their scheduled follow-up appointments at clinics. Patients with distant follow-up appointment dates may visit or contact the respective clinics for necessary arrangements.

Meanwhile, the HA spokesperson reminds the public to stay vigilant about personal and environmental hygiene during the holidays to avoid spreading diseases. Members of the public who develop respiratory symptoms should wear masks and seek medical advice promptly. Non-emergency patients should avoid using Accident & Emergency services and instead seek treatment at FMCs and FMICs, private doctors or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es. Members of the public can visit the Health Bureau's Primary Care Directory www.pcdirectory.gov.hk to choose a family doctor and view related clinic service information.

消防處嚴陣以待並作出特別行動部署，包括於剛過去的周末設立高級指揮室，以加強各行動單位之間的協調和應對山火的能力，以及透過靈活調配內部資源，增加前線人手及消防車輛應對突發事故。

消防處經評估後鎖定新界北區八個山火熱點，聯同民眾安全服務隊，額外調配超過200名前線人員，組成巡邏小隊在熱點巡邏，提醒市民注意火種，並在可行情況下快速撲滅初期火勢，防止山火蔓延。

另一方面，消防處積極集合地區力量進行防火宣傳，透過消防處社區聯動網絡與地區防火委員會加強聯繫，並聯同消防處社區應急先鋒名譽會長會及消防處社區應急先鋒，由剛過去的周末開始，於多個掃墓熱點及鄉郊地區向市民推廣防火安全教育。

在科技應用方面，消防處除使用搭載揚聲器的無人機於掃墓熱點廣播防火信息外，亦首次應用兩個低空經濟「監管沙盒」項目，包括運用可負載30公斤的大型無人機運送滅火工具，如背泵及山草拍等，提升行動效率；另外亦使用無人機搭配自動化無人機機場，在郊野地區自動定期巡邏，並配合人工智能技術以偵測早期火災，有助救援人員能更早掌握現場情況及作出相應部署。

數據顯示，大部分山火都因人為疏忽引起，因此防止山火實有賴各方通力合作。消防處提醒市民切勿留下火種或燃燒野草，一同為防止山火出一分力。"

  Secondary One to Secondary Four students from underprivileged families, particularly those living in subdivided units, may submit applications through the Programme's mobile application starting today and approach their schools or the non-governmental organisations that assist the Government in implementing the Programme (see Annex) for enquiries if they are interested. Applications will close on November 16.

  The Programme is formulated and implemented by an interdepartmental task force led by the Chief Secretary for Administration. Through tripartite collaboration among the Government, the business sector and the community, the Programme provides focused support for Secondary One to Secondary Four students from underprivileged families, particularly those living in subdivided units. The Programme comprises three key elements, including mentorship, personal development plans and financial support. Through a one-year intensive foundation training that includes mentorship and a structured programme covering orientation, basic training, mentor-mentee interaction, diverse group activities, Mainland study and exchange tours, etc, the Programme will help mentees broaden their horizons, reinforce self-confidence, develop a positive outlook on life, explore more possibilities for personal development, set goals for the future and strive for upward mobility.

  In addition, each mentee will be provided with start-up financial support of $5,000 under the Programme. Mentors will assist and guide mentees in developing positive financial planning concepts and implementing their personal development plans. Upon successful completion of the Programme, a scholarship of $5,000 will be awarded to the mentees for their personal pursuits by applying the financial planning concepts that they have learned.

  Upon successful completion of the one-year intensive foundation training of the Programme, mentees will automatically become members of the Alumni Club where they will continue to expand their social network and horizons by participating in diverse activities and job tasting/internship programmes.

FSD's special operations deployment for hill fires during Chung Yeung Festival (with photos),2025-10-27 12:00,2025-10-27 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102400600.htm,"âThe Fire Services Department (FSD) today (October 27) announced the special operations deployment for hill fires during the Chung Yeung Festival. It also urged members of the public to avoid leaving ignition sources when paying tribute to ancestors at graveyards or visiting the countryside to prevent hill fires.

The FSD is fully prepared and launched the special operations deployment, including setting up a High Command in the past weekend to strengthen co-ordination and the capability to respond to hill fires among operational units. Additionally, through flexible allocation of internal resources, extra frontline staff and fire services appliances were deployed to handle emergencies.

The FSD identified eight hill fire hotspots in North District in the New Territories after assessment. Over 200 additional frontline staff from the FSD and the Civil Aid Service were deployed to form patrol teams to patrol these hotspots. The teams served to remind the public to be cautious with fire, and to quickly extinguish initial fires to prevent the spread of hill fires where feasible.

Meanwhile, the FSD actively collaborated with the community on fire prevention publicity. With the strengthened ties with the District Fire Safety Committees through the FSD Community Collaboration Network, and in collaboration with the FSD Community Emergency Responder Honorary Presidents' Association and FSD Community Emergency Responders, the department disseminated fire safety messages to the public at various graveyards and rural areas over the past weekend.

In terms of technology application, apart from using drones equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast fire prevention messages at graveyards, the FSD also utilised two low-altitude economy Regulatory Sandbox projects for the first time. The department deployed a 30-kilogram payload capacity drone to transport fire-fighting equipment such as flexible backpack pumps and fire beaters to enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, drones and automated drone docks were deployed to conduct regular autonomic patrols in the countryside to achieve early fire detection by leveraging AI technology. The equipment enabled rescuers to appraise the onsite situation more promptly and make deployments accordingly.

As data revealed that most hill fires are caused by human negligence, preventing hill fires relies on the collaborative efforts of various parties. The FSD reminds the public not to leave any ignition sources or to burn weeds in order to prevent hill fires."
申訴專員全面調查滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處就滲水問題的處理（附圖）,2025-10-27 11:00,2025-10-27 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700239.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（十月二十七日）宣布展開全面調查，詳細審研滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處（滲水辦）就滲水問題的處理。

滲水成因複雜，包括因樓宇結構或裝置出現問題，又或樓宇欠缺適當保養而引致。若滲水造成滋擾影響公眾衞生、構成樓宇結構安全風險，政府便會考慮行使法例賦予的權力介入。政府成立滲水辦，目標是透過為市民提供一站式服務處理滲水的舉報，加快調查及找出滲水源頭，並提高解決滲水問題的成功率。

公署接獲申訴，指稱因上層單位在平台僭建引致下層單位滲水，但滲水辦未有適時進行滲水調查，屋宇署發出清拆令逾年但僭建物仍未清拆，以致問題持續。

陳積志表示：「巿民大眾都希望有個安穩舒適的居所。但滲水問題一直以來都會為巿民帶來不少困擾。根據政府的統計資料，在二○二二、二三及二四年三年間，滲水辦接獲的樓宇滲水投訴個案分別為39 555宗、45 033宗和47 299宗。公署亦經常接獲巿民就滲水問題提出申訴。另外，有資料顯示屋宇署在發出清拆令後未有適時要求業主遵辦，以致可能因僭建而引致的滲水持續。因此，我決定展開這項全面調查，詳細審研滲水辦就滲水問題的處理，包括納入屋宇署處理引致滲水的僭建物調查的程序，探討當中有否改善空間，並提出適切改善建議。公署亦十分關注滲水辦的整體運作，將以系列形式深入探討滲水辦的調查行動過程及成效，包括滲水辦對顧問公司的監管。」

Ombudsman probes handling of water seepage cases by Joint Office for Investigation of Water Seepage Complaints (with photos),2025-10-27 11:00,2025-10-27 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700244.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (October 27) announced the launch of a full investigation into the Joint Office for Investigation of Water Seepage Complaints (JO)'s handling of water seepage cases.

  The causes of water seepage are complex. It may result from defective building structures or installations, or from a lack of proper maintenance. If the seepage poses a nuisance, public health hazard or a potential risk to building safety, the Government may consider exercising its statutory powers to intervene. To enhance efficiency in handling reports of water seepage, the Government has established the JO to provide the public with a one-stop service. The objective is to expedite investigations for identifying the source of seepage more effectively, and improve the success rate in resolving seepage problems.

  The Office noted from complaint handling that unauthorised building works (UBWs) on a flat roof of an upper flat have caused water seepage in the lower flat. However, the JO did not conduct an investigation into the seepage problem in a timely manner. Although the Buildings Department (BD) issued a removal order over a year ago, the UBWs have yet to be demolished, resulting in the continued seepage problem.

  Mr Chan said, ""It is Hong Kong people’s common hope that they should be able to enjoy a well-maintained and comfortable living environment, but water seepage problems undoubtedly cause much inconvenience and distress to affected residents. According to government statistics, in 2022, 2023 and 2024 the number of complaints about water seepage in buildings received by the JO was 39 555, 45 033 and 47 299 respectively. Also, complaints from the public regarding unresolved seepage problems are common. In addition, there is information indicating that the BD did not promptly enforce compliance with removal orders issued against UBWs, resulting in persistent seepage problems potentially caused by the UBWs. In this light, I have decided to launch a full investigation into the JO's handling of water seepage cases, including the BD’s procedures for handling UBWs that may lead to water seepage, to identify areas for improvement and to put forward appropriate recommendations. We are also very concerned about the overall operation of the JO and will launch a series of reviews to probe deeply into the JO's investigation operation process and effectiveness, including the JO's monitoring of its consultants.""

  The Ombudsman welcomes views from members of the public on this topic. Written submissions should reach the Office by November 27, 2025:

Part A ""Taxi Operation"" will include new questions relating to the series of new measures introduced for enhancing taxi service quality (e.g. taxi fleet regime and the Taxi-Driver-Offence Points system). The questions on prominent locations and route identification have been substantially reduced and simplified in consideration of the development of navigation technology. Part B ""Road Users' Code"" will include knowledge on road traffic regulations and safe driving. The Written Test is conducted in the form of multiple-choice questions, and the total number of questions has been adjusted from 90 to 75, while the passing criteria and time allowed for each part remain unchanged. To score an overall pass result, a candidate must meet the passing criteria in both Parts A and B.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""The further enhanced Taxi Written Test will better align with the practical needs of the taxi trade while maintaining the level of assessment, ensuring that taxi drivers possess the necessary professional knowledge and qualities. We hope that more newcomers will be attracted to join the taxi industry to foster the healthy development of the taxi trade in the long run. Furthermore, following the passage of the bill on ride-hailing service, taxi driving licence holders can apply for a ride-hailing vehicle driving permit in future without having to sit an additional test.""

  The TD has issued letters to the taxi trade introducing the scope of the new Written Test, and distributed the updated Guide to Taxi Written Test and Taxi Operation Booklet to candidates concerned. Candidates can refer to the TD's website and book a Taxi Written Test online via GovHK."
