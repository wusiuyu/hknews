​一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙及進口另類吸煙產品罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-07-23 16:10,2025-07-23 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300571.htm,"一名入境女旅客因管有未完稅香煙，未有向海關人員作出申報，以及進口另類吸煙產品，違反《應課稅品條例》和《進出口條例》，今日（七月二十三日）在西九龍裁判法院被判處監禁五個月和罰款一千元。

海關人員於五月十一日在香港國際機場截查一名四十九歲的抵港女旅客，並在她的個人行李內共檢獲四萬支未完稅香煙及六千四百支另類吸煙產品，估計市值共約十八萬三千元，應課稅值共約十三萬二千元。該名抵港旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

根據《進出口條例》，任何人進口另類吸煙產品即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and importing alternative smoking products (with photo),2025-07-23 16:10,2025-07-23 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300569.htm,"An incoming female passenger was sentenced to five months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (July 23) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming female passenger, aged 49, at Hong Kong International Airport on May 11. Forty thousand duty-not-paid cigarettes and 6 400 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $183,000 and a duty potential of about $132,000 in total, were seized from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
立法會十七題：學生內地交流計劃,2025-07-23 16:00,2025-07-23 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300354.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上吳秋北議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆：

問題：

早前有傳媒報道，有香港學生在參加內地交流團（交流團）時出現不同情況的問題，引發市民對交流團質素的疑慮，亦可能影響家長及師生北上交流的意願。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）自學生內地交流計劃開展以來，教育局共資助了多少間中小學校，以及有多少名中小學生參與；該計劃的成效為何；

（二）教育局有否向各學校提供挑選交流團的承辦機構的招標準則；如有，詳情為何；當局就交流團的衞生和住宿安全等範疇有何審查機制，以及有否制訂指引，列明承辦機構應對事故能力的要求；及

（三）據悉教育局曾指出若交流團的質素欠佳，當局將不會再邀請相關承辦機構入標，當局有否根據承辦機構舉辦交流團的紀錄作挑選準則，以及相關挑選機制的成效為何；當局有否機制定期檢視和優化交流團的安排（例如行程安排和揀選愛國主義教育的行程）；有否承辦機構因其紀錄欠佳而被教育局在可舉辦交流團的名單上剔除；如有，詳情為何？

答覆：

主席：

自二○○四／○五學年開始，教育局每年均會配合國家的最新發展和學校課程，為學生提供內地交流的機會，包括籌辦及資助學校舉辦不同主題的學生內地交流計劃，每年提供約十萬個資助名額，足夠讓每名學生在中小學階段最少各獲一次到內地交流的機會。教育局委託外間機構承辦初中及高小學生「同根同心」內地交流計劃、中學生「同行萬里」內地交流計劃等，提供交通、膳宿和交流活動等服務；為更好地照顧師生，每團均會安排持牌專業醫護人員或持有效急救證書的領隊同行。學校亦可向教育局申請資助，包括初中及高小學生交流活動資助計劃──「赤子情 中國心」及「高中學生交流活動資助計劃」兩項計劃，按校本及學生學習需要自行設計內地交流活動。學生內地交流計劃配合課程學習元素，涵蓋多元化的學習主題，包括歷史、文化、經濟、科技等，讓學生通過參與上述不同計劃，從多角度親身體會國家不同方面的發展，鞏固和深化課堂學習，以加深他們對國家的認識，提升國民身份認同。學生內地交流活動舉辦以來，學習成效顯著。此外，為配合高中公民與社會發展科（公民科）的落實，教育局於二○二三年四月開展公民科內地考察。內地考察屬於公民科課程的重要組成部分，所有修讀本地課程的高中學生會獲全額資助，參與一次由教育局籌辦的公民科內地考察。學生完成公民科內地考察後，必須進行專題研習，並以個人習作形式向學校呈交報告。

就吳秋北議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）學生內地交流計劃由學生自願報名參加，一直受學校、家長及學生歡迎。由二○一四／一五至二○一八／一九五個學年，中小學生參與人次由約五萬增加至超過七萬。隨着香港與內地恢復全面通關，教育局於二○二三／二四學年重啓學生內地交流計劃，學校反應積極，學生參與人數約六萬八千，與疫情前的水平相若。二○二四／二五學年的情況更令人鼓舞，逾八萬名中小學生已報名參與學生內地交流計劃，可見計劃廣受學校歡迎；學校會按校情及學生學習需要決定出發日期。在二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五學年，參與內地交流計劃的學生人數如下：




學年
學生人數
			（下捨入最接近的百位數）


2022/23
600


2023/24+
68200


2024/25++
81000



+ 修訂去年預算所得的實際數字
++ 臨時數字（實際數字於出發後確定）

此外，教育局於二○二三年四月起開展公民科內地考察，過去三個學年（二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五學年）累計已安排超過140 000名高中學生和15 000名教師參與。教育局持續優化公民科內地考察的規模和安排，行程由二○二二／二三學年22個一至三天廣東省行程，增加至二○二四／二五學年28個一至五天行程，涵蓋11個省份和直轄巿，讓學生於內地考察期間參與不同類型的學習活動；並安排部分行程在當地綜合實踐活動基地或其他參訪點進行體驗式學習活動。在二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五學年，參加公民科內地考察的學生人數如下：




學年
學生人數
			（下捨入最接近的百位數）


2022/23

49 900


2024/25++
50 400



+ 修訂去年預算所得的實際數字
++ 臨時數字（實際數字於出發後確定）

總括而言，中小學生內地交流計劃和公民科內地考察對學生的裨益無容置疑。根據問卷調查結果，師生評價十分正面，他們普遍認為內地交流及考察有助延展課堂所學，加深學生對國家歷史、文化、科技發展等方面的了解，培養對國家的歸屬感，提升國民身份認同；通過兩地學生進行交流，建立友誼；亦有助學生認識國家高速發展的情況，有利他們掌握未來發展機遇。

（二）及（三）在挑選內地交流及考察團承辦機構方面，教育局一直按政府的既定程序進行採購及審批工作，依據公平、公開和公正的原則採購服務；承辦機構必須具備舉辦學生內地交流及考察的相關經驗；評審標書時，教育局會同時考慮技術（包括創新建議）及價格因素，並不一定是價低者得。

教育局以學生安全和健康為首要考慮，設有恆常機制保障學生參與內地交流及考察期間的安全；例如承辦機構須按教育局要求，為內地交流和考察活動訂定不同緊急情況的應變守則和安排，如惡劣天氣、意外事故、證件遺失、身體不適等，並由教育局審核。每個行程出發前，教育局要求承辦機構與學校妥善溝通，並安排到校簡介會，講解有關行程、注意事項，以及如何應對突發情況等，亦向師生派發手冊和個人名牌，當中載有應對緊急事故的資訊（如內地緊急求助電話、隨團工作人員資料及聯絡電話），以便參加者於行程期間查閱。教育局設有學生安全通報機制，承辦機構於行程期間每天須報告各團狀況。此外，教育局與承辦機構定期舉行會議、派員出席活動以評估內容的適切性和收集參加者的意見、進行問卷調查，以及透過面談及活動後分享會等評鑑參加者對活動的意見，以持續優化及開拓不同主題的內地交流及考察活動。我們亦會定期檢討承辦機構的表現，通過實地考察、工作報告等方式監察承辦機構的工作進度和落實情況。如遇承辦機構表現欠佳，教育局會按既定機制處理；根據現有紀錄，沒有承辦機構因其紀錄欠佳而被教育局在可舉辦交流及考察團的名單上剔除。

就早前的學生內地交流及考察團當中，有個別學校的學生出現腸胃炎徵狀的事件，我們已與相關內地機構／單位嚴肅和迅速跟進，為有關學校提供適切支援，包括在取得家長同意下安排不適的學生前往當地就醫、為他們調動房間以防止交叉感染，以及提供消毒用品及消毒旅遊巴。為安全起見，雖然未能核實病源，我們已即時要求有關承辦機構停用懷疑涉事餐廳，並要求所有為學生內地交流計劃及公民科內地考察團提供膳食的餐廳暫停供應生冷食品、已煮熟的貝類海鮮等。各團均已在順利完成行程後回港。

同時，我們亦隨即成立學生內地考察專責小組，適時優化交流及考察活動的安排，包括直接與各內地部門及單位聯繫，定期安排對接會議，以完善不同設施和安排，加強保障學生安全；與承辦機構建立共識，強化突發事件的通報機制，如遇事故，盡快了解事態發展，提供適切支援，並再次提醒他們在行程安排、住宿和膳食等方面，均須有更周詳的計劃和應變措施；更新出發前到校簡介會的簡報和指引等，提升教師和學生的衞生及安全意識；以及與衞生署衞生防護中心密切聯繫，於「薪火相傳」國民教育活動系列網站（www.passontorch.org.hk）不時更新由教育局及衞生署提供的預防及控制疾病最新資訊，提醒全港中小學於出團前須瀏覽及掌握有關資訊。為讓隨團教師掌握交流團的最新資訊，教育局定期舉辦簡介會暨分享會，推廣不同學校的良好做法，並提供應對緊急情況的示例，以供學校參考。

在推展愛國主義教育方面，《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出由二○二四／二五學年起，在學生內地交流及考察活動提供不少於30個「紅色資源」行程，教育局已作相應配合，分別於學生內地交流計劃30個行程和公民科內地考察11個行程加入相關的參訪點，包括歷史遺址、博物館、專題紀念館等及學習活動。為進一步加強愛國主義教育，並配合《香港國家安全教育課程框架》（2025）的推行及紀念抗戰勝利80周年，由二○二五／二六學年起，學生內地交流計劃和公民科內地考察「紅色資源」行程將分別增加至33個和15個，以助學生了解革命故事和革命先輩的奮鬥足跡，培育民族精神。教育局會持續蒐集不同持份者意見，檢視學生內地交流及考察活動的成效和優化有關安排，並透過學校探訪、視學、收集學生作品（包括照片、短片和學生感言）、與教師和學生訪談等途徑，了解學生內地考察的學習成效和向公眾分享學生學習成果。

教育局一直積極籌辦各類型的學生內地交流及考察活動，讓廣大學生受惠，並普遍獲得學校的支持與肯定，學生學習成果亦有目共睹。我們期望持份者繼續支持學生內地交流及考察活動；教育局亦會秉承初心，持續提升學生內地交流計劃的質素，與各持份者攜手締造更豐碩的成果。"
立法會五題：烈酒稅,2025-07-23 16:00,2025-07-23 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300546.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上黃英豪議員的提問和署理商務及經濟發展局局長陳百里博士的答覆：

問題：

政府自去年十月起將進口價高於200元的烈酒，200元以上部分的稅率由百分之一百降至百分之十。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計調低烈酒稅率後，至今烈酒的進口及轉口貨值和貨量的變化，以及該等數據與下調稅率前的比較為何，並按烈酒類別（例如中國白酒、威士忌和拔蘭地）列出分項數字；

（二）鑑於政府表示下調烈酒稅的目的是促進香港成為高價烈酒貿易中心，並帶動餐飲、酒店、物流倉儲等行業發展，政府有否評估政策實施後有否達到預期成效；會否研究進一步下調烈酒稅率；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）衞生署有否在烈酒稅率下調後進行人口健康調查，統計飲用烈酒的15歲或以上人口比例數字；會否加強有關飲酒與健康的宣傳教育工作，以預防市民出現酒精依賴、酗酒和暴飲等問題；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就黃英豪議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局、政府統計處（統計處）及香港海關後，現綜合回覆如下：

現時，香港的烈酒稅適用於作本地銷售或其他用途的烈酒，而出口及經香港轉口到其他地區的烈酒則無需繳付烈酒稅。因此，調低烈酒稅率措施對進口供本地使用的烈酒有較直接影響，而烈酒轉口貿易則較受全球經濟狀況及地緣政治等宏觀因素影響。

根據香港海關提供的統計數字，由去年十月十六日調低高端烈酒稅率後至今年六月底的八個半月，進口並已完稅的烈酒貨量（按升計算）和其價值與調低烈酒稅率前八個半月比較均有上升，其中烈酒進口貨量上升逾兩成，而價值則大幅上升近九成，反映政府引進的雙層稅制有效鼓勵高價烈酒貿易。有關已完稅的烈酒貨量和價值在下調烈酒稅率前後的比較，以及按烈酒種類劃分的細分統計數字載於附件一供議員參考。

另一方面，由於轉口烈酒無需繳付烈酒稅，香港海關沒有備存轉口烈酒價值的統計數字。而由統計處提供的資料已載於附件二。

由於調低烈酒稅率的措施實施時間尚短，其在各方面的成效仍有待觀察。對於部分業界希望政府可進一步下調烈酒稅，我們希望重申，降低烈酒稅的目的，是鼓勵業界在香港進行高價值烈酒的貿易拍賣，藉此帶動物流和儲庫、旅遊和高端美食消費等高增值產業的發展。與此同時，我們亦應謹慎地避免因調低烈酒稅而導致市民增加飲用烈酒，因而衍生其他問題。

政府推出有關措施時，已充分平衡推動經濟發展、維持公共財政穩健及保障公眾健康等不同的政策考慮。我們會密切留意烈酒貿易的發展，適時檢討措施成效。任何進一步調整均需審慎考慮各方面的影響，並從長計議。政府現階段未有計劃再次調整烈酒稅。

事實上，政府一直非常關注酒精帶來的相關危害，特別是針對酒精依賴、酗酒和暴飲，並於二○一八年推行《邁向2025：香港非傳染病防控策略及行動計劃》，訂下於二○二五年或之前實現的九項本地目標，當中包括「減少酒精相關危害」。政府會繼續以風險為本的方式，透過宣傳、教育、治療和支援服務，減低酒精相關危害。其中，衞生署資助非政府機構推出「戒酒輔導服務先導計劃」。先導計劃由二○二四年四月八日起提供服務，為期兩年，向懷疑有酒精依賴的香港居民提供免費輔導服務。衞生署亦於二○二二年起開展「認清酒害」宣傳教育運動，加強市民認識飲酒的健康風險，並提供線上飲酒行為風險評估、個人化健康建議、自助工具和健康教育資源等，鼓勵飲酒人士為健康着想改變自己的飲酒行為。

另外，衞生署每約五年進行一次人口健康調查，期間亦進行健康行為調查作恆常監測，了解香港市民的健康狀況，包括飲酒行為。過去人口健康調查與飲酒行為相關的數字載於附件三。2025/26年度人口健康調查預計於今年第三季正式開始，並於二○二六年尾有結果，會反映烈酒稅局部調低後的情況。"

Question:

 Since October last year, the Government has reduced the duty rate for liquor with import price over $200 from 100 per cent to 10 per cent for the portion above $200. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the changes in the value and volume of imports and re-exports of liquor to date after the reduction in the duty rate on liquor, and how such data compare with those prior to the reduction, together with a breakdown by type of liquor (e.g. Chinese baijiu, whisky and brandy);

(2) as the Government has indicated that the reduction in the duty rate on liquor aims to promote the development of Hong Kong into a trading hub for high-end liquor and boost the growth of various industries such as catering, hotel, logistics and warehousing, whether the Government has assessed if the policy has achieved the expected effects after its implementation; whether the Government will study a further reduction in the duty rate on liquor; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the Department of Health has, after the reduction in the duty rate on liquor, conducted a population health survey to compile statistics on the proportion of the population aged 15 or above who have consumed liquor; whether it will step up its efforts to publicise and educate the public about the health effects of alcohol, in order to prevent problems such as alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse and binge drinking; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Health Bureau, the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) and the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), the consolidated reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Kennedy Wong is as follows:

 Currently, liquor duty in Hong Kong is levied on liquor for local sales or other uses, while liquor for export or re-export through Hong Kong to other regions is not subject to duty. As such, the liquor duty reduction has a more direct impact on liquor imported for local consumption, whereas the re-export trade of liquor is more influenced by macro factors such as global economic conditions and geopolitics.

 According to the statistics from the C&ED, during the 8.5-month period from the reduction of the duty rate on high-end liquor on October 16 last year to the end of June this year, both the volume (in litre) and value of duty-paid liquor import increased as compared with the 8.5-month period prior to the liquor duty reduction. Of these, the import volume of liquor rose by more than 20 per cent, while its value went up significantly by nearly 90 per cent, reflecting that the two-tier system introduced by the Government is effective in boosting high-end liquor trading. A comparison of the volume and value of duty-paid liquor before and after the reduction in liquor duty rate, as well as detailed statistics breakdown by type of liquor, is provided in Annex I for Members' reference.

 On the other hand, as liquor duty is not levied on re-exported liquor, the C&ED does not maintain statistical data on the value of liquor re-export. The information provided by the C&SD is set out in Annex II.

 As the liquor duty reduction has only been implemented for a short period, its effectiveness in various aspects remains to be observed. Regarding the suggestion from some members of the trade that the Government should further reduce the duty on liquor, we would like to reiterate that the purpose of lowering liquor duty is to encourage the trade and auctions of high-end liquor in Hong Kong, thereby giving impetus to the development of other high value-added sectors such as logistics and storage, tourism as well as high-end food and beverage consumption. At the same time, we are also mindful of the need to avoid increasing liquor consumption among the public as a result of reducing liquor duty, thereby leading to other problems.

 When introducing the relevant measures, the Government has fully balanced different policy considerations such as promoting economic development, maintaining stable public finances and protecting public health. We will closely monitor the development of the liquor trade and review the effectiveness of the measures in a timely manner. Any further adjustments will require careful consideration of the impact on different aspects with prudent planning. The Government currently has no plan to further adjust the duty rate on liquor.

 In fact, the Government has been attaching great importance to the harms brought by alcohol, in particular alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse and binge drinking. In 2018, the Government launched the ""Towards 2025: Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent and Control Non-communicable Diseases in Hong Kong"", setting out nine local targets, with ""reduce harmful use of alcohol"" being one of them, to be achieved by 2025. The Government will continue to adopt a risk-based approach to reduce alcohol-related harm through publicity, education, treatment and support services. Among which, the Department of Health (DH) has launched the Pilot Alcohol Cessation Counselling Service (Pilot Programme) through subvention to a non-governmental organisation. The Pilot Programme was launched on April 8, 2024, and will last for two years to provide free counselling service for Hong Kong residents identified to have probable alcohol dependence. The DH has also launched a publicity and education campaign named ""Understanding Alcohol Harm"" since 2022 to enhance the public's understanding of the health risks associated with alcohol consumption; and provides online risk assessment of drinking behaviour, personalised health advice, self-help tools, health education resources, etc to encourage drinkers to change their drinking behaviour for the sake of their health.

 In addition, the DH conducts the Population Health Survey (PHS) approximately every five years with the Health Behaviour Survey conducted in between as regular surveillance to understand the health status of the Hong Kong population, including drinking behaviours. Figures relevant to drinking behaviours in past PHSs are set out in Annex III. The 2025/26 PHS is expected to commence in the third quarter this year with the findings to be available in end-2026, which would reflect the situation after the partial reduction of duty on liquor."
LCQ17: Mainland exchange programmes for students,2025-07-23 16:00,2025-07-23 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300362.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Stanley Ng and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

The media earlier reported that some Hong Kong students had developed problems of different natures while participating in Mainland exchange tours (exchange tours), which has aroused public concerns about the quality of the exchange tours and may have an impact on the willingness of parents, teachers and students to go north for exchange. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the total number of primary and secondary schools that have been subsidised by the Education Bureau (EDB) and the number of primary and secondary students who have participated since the implementation of the Mainland exchange programmes for students; the effectiveness of the programmes;

(2) whether the EDB has provided various schools with the tendering criteria for selecting the service providers of exchange tours; if so, of the details; the review mechanism in place to examine areas such as health and accommodation safety of the exchange tours, and whether guidelines have been drawn up to specify the requirements for the capability of service providers to respond to incidents; and

(3) it is learnt that the EDB has pointed out that if the quality of the exchange tours was poor, the service providers concerned would not be invited to submit bid again by the authorities, whether the authorities have used the service providers' records of the exchange tours as the selection criterion, and of the effectiveness of the relevant selection mechanism; whether the authorities have put in place a mechanism to regularly review and enhance the arrangements for the exchange tours (e.g. the itinerary arrangements and selection of itineraries for patriotic education); whether any service providers have been removed from the list of potential service providers for exchange tours by the EDB due to poor track record; if so, of the details?

Reply:

President,

Since the 2004/05 school year, the Education Bureau (EDB) has been providing students with Mainland exchange opportunities in line with the country's latest developments and the school curriculum every year. This includes organising Mainland exchange programmes (MEPs) of different themes for students and subsidising schools to organise such programmes. Approximately 100 000 subsidised quotas are provided each year to ensure that every student has the opportunity to join at least one MEP each in their primary and secondary stages. The EDB has commissioned external organisations to provide services (e.g. transportation, meals, accommodation and exchange activities) for programmes such as the Mainland Exchange Programme for Junior Secondary and Upper Primary Students and the Mainland Exchange Programme for Secondary School Students, etc. To take better care of students and teachers, every tour will be accompanied by a licensed medical professional or a tour escort holding a valid first aid certificate. Schools may also apply for subsidies from the EDB under two programmes, namely the Junior Secondary and Upper Primary School Students Exchange Programme Subsidy Scheme: ""Understanding Our Motherland"" and the Senior Secondary School Students Exchange Programme Subvention Scheme, to design their own Mainland exchange activities according to school-based needs and students' learning needs. MEPs for students align with learning elements of the curriculum and cover diversified learning themes, including history, culture, economics, science and technology. Through participation in the various programmes mentioned above, students can gain first-hand experience of the development of our country from multiple perspectives, and consolidate and deepen classroom learning. This will in turn enhance their understanding of the country and their sense of national identity. Mainland exchange activities for students have delivered remarkable learning outcomes since their launch. Furthermore, to tie in with the implementation of the senior secondary subject of Citizenship and Social Development (CS), the EDB has launched CS Mainland study tours since April 2023. As Mainland study tours form an integral part of the CS curriculum, all senior secondary students studying the local curriculum will receive a full subsidy once to participate in CS Mainland study tours organised by the EDB. After completing their CS Mainland study tours, students have to conduct project learning and submit a report to the school in the form of an individual project.

Our reply to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Ng is as follows:

(1) With student participation on a voluntary basis, MEPs for students have all along been well received by schools, parents and students. During the five school years (s.y.) from the 2014/15 to 2018/19 s.y., the number of primary and secondary student participants increased from approximately 50 000 to more than 70 000. With full resumption of normal travel between Hong Kong and the Mainland, the EDB resumed MEPs for students in the 2023/24 s.y., and the responses from schools were positive, with around 68 000 students participating, which was comparable to its pre-pandemic level. The response in the 2024/25 s.y. is even more encouraging, with over 80 000 primary and secondary students already enrolled in MEPs for students, showing that the programmes are highly popular among schools. Schools will decide on the departure dates based on their school context and students' learning needs. The numbers of students participating in MEPs from the 2022/23 to the 2024/25 s.y. are as follows:




School year
Number of students
			(rounded down to the nearest hundred)


2022/23
600


2023/24+
68200


2024/25++
81000



+ Actual figures revised from last year's estimates
++ Provisional figures (actual figures to be confirmed after departure)

In addition, following the launch of CS Mainland study tours since April 2023, the EDB has arranged for a cumulative total of more than 140 000 senior secondary students and 15 000 teachers to take part in the study tours in the past three school years (from the 2022/23 to 2024/25 s.y.). The EDB has continued to enhance the scale of and arrangements for CS Mainland study tours. With respect to the number of routes, there is an increase from 22 one-to-three-day tours in the Guangdong Province in the 2022/23 s.y. to 28 one-to-five-day tours in the 2024/25 s.y., covering 11 provinces and municipalities, so as to enable students to participate in various types of learning activities during CS Mainland study tours. Experiential learning activities are arranged in the activity bases for students' comprehensive practice or other visiting spots as part of the itinerary. The numbers of students participating in CS Mainland study tours from the 2022/23 to 2024/25 s.y. are as follows:




School year
Number of students
			(rounded down to the nearest hundred)


2022/23
43 300


2023/24+
49 900


2024/25++
50 400



+ Actual figures revised from last year's estimates
++ Provisional figures (actual figures to be confirmed after departure)

In conclusion, it is without doubt that MEPs for primary and secondary students and CS Mainland study tours are beneficial to students. According to the results of questionnaire survey, feedback from teachers and students on these programmes are very positive. They generally consider that Mainland exchange and study tours have extended classroom learning and deepened students' understanding of our country's history, culture and technological development, etc, thereby instilling in them a sense of belonging to our country and enhancing their sense of national identity; facilitated friendship building through exchanges between local and Mainland students; and enhanced students' understanding of the rapid development of our country to help them seize future development opportunities.

(2) and (3) In selecting service providers for Mainland exchange and study tours, the EDB has all along been following the established government procedures of services procurement, with assessment and approval made under the principles of fairness, openness and impartiality. Service providers are required to have relevant experiences in organising Mainland exchange and study tours for students. During tender evaluation, the EDB will take into account both technical factors (including pro-innovation proposals) and price factors, and may not necessarily award contracts to the lowest bidders.

With the safety and health of students as the prime concern, the EDB has established a regular mechanism to safeguard the safety of students during Mainland exchange and study tours. For instance, the service providers are required by the EDB to formulate for its scrutiny contingency guidelines and arrangements for handling various emergency situations encountered in Mainland exchange and study tours, such as inclement weather, accidents, loss of identity documents and physical discomfort. Prior to departure of each tour, the service providers are required to communicate properly with the schools and arrange on-site briefings to go through the itinerary, points to note and ways to cope with emergencies, etc. Handbooks and name badges containing information about dealing with emergency incidents (e.g. emergency telephone numbers in the Mainland, and particulars and contact numbers of the accompanying staff) will be distributed to teachers and students for persual during the tour. The EDB has put in place a notification mechanism on the safety of students, through which the service providers are required to report on a daily basis the situation of each of the tours during the course of the journey. In addition, the EDB gauges participants' feedback of these programmes by holding regular meetings with the service providers, deploying staff to attend the programmes to assess the appropriateness of the content and collecting views of the participants, conducting questionnaire surveys, and evaluating the opinions of the participants towards the programmes by arranging interviews and post-tour sharing sessions. Such efforts are conducive to the continuous enhancement and exploration of diverse themes for Mainland exchange and study tours. We will also regularly review the performance of the service providers concerned and monitor the progress and implementation of their work through field inspections and work reports, etc. Any cases of unsatisfactory performance of service providers will be handled by the EDB according to the established mechanism. According to existing records, no service provider has been removed from the list of potential service providers for exchange and study tours by the EDB due to poor track records.

Regarding the incidents in which students of individual schools had developed gastroenteritis symptoms during the Mainland exchange and study tours for students conducted earlier, we seriously and promptly followed up with relevant Mainland organisations/units to provide appropriate support for the schools concerned, including arranging for those students feeling sick to see a local doctor upon parental consent, reallocating rooms for them to prevent cross-infection, providing antiseptic products and arranging disinfection of the coaches. For the sake of safety, while the source of the outbreak could not be verified, we had immediately requested relevant service providers to stop patronising the suspected eatery, and required all those which offered catering service for MEPs for students and CS Mainland study tours to temporarily stop serving raw and undercooked food and cooked shellfish, etc. All the tours concerned had returned to Hong Kong after successful completion of their journey.

Meanwhile, we have promptly set up a dedicated task force for student Mainland study tours to enhance the arrangements for exchange and study activities in a timely manner. Efforts include directly liaising and arranging regular collaboration meetings with Mainland departments and units, with a view to improving various facilities and arrangements to further ensure students' safety. We have also reached a consensus with service providers on strengthening the notification mechanism for unforeseen incidents. In the event of an incident, the service providers should get to know the situation as soon as possible, keep abreast of its developments, and provide appropriate assistance. They have also been reminded that there should be more detailed planning and contingency measures for the itinerary, accommodation and catering arrangements, etc. The information presented and guidelines for the pre-departure on-site briefings have also been updated to enhance the hygiene and safety awareness of teachers and students. Moreover, we will maintain close liaison with the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health (DH) to update from time to time the latest information on disease prevention and control provided by the EDB and the DH on the ""Passing on the Torch"" National Education Activities Series website (www.passontorch.org.hk/en), and remind all primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong to check out and get familiar with such information before setting off for the tours. To enable accompanying teachers to get hold of the latest information on exchange tours, the EDB will regularly organise briefings and sharing sessions to promote the good practices of different schools and provide illustrative examples on how to respond to emergencies for the schools' reference.

On promoting patriotic education, it was mentioned in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" that starting from the 2024/25 s.y., at least 30 routes with ""red resources"" would be provided through the Mainland exchange and study tours for students. The EDB has made corresponding arrangements to incorporate relevant visiting spots, including historical sites, museums and thematic memorial halls, as well as learning activities, into 30 routes of MEPs and 11 routes of CS Mainland study tours respectively. To further strengthen patriotic education, and tie in with the launch of the Curriculum Framework of National Security Education in Hong Kong (2025) and mark the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance, starting from the 2025/26 s.y., the number of routes with ""red resources"" to be provided through MEPs and CS Mainland study tours for students will be increased to 33 and 15 respectively to facilitate students' understanding of the revolutionary stories and arduous struggles of our revolutionary predecessors and foster their national spirit. The EDB will continue to gauge views from different stakeholders for reviewing the effectiveness of and enhance the arrangements for the Mainland exchange and study tours for students. The EDB will also keep in view the learning effectiveness of the Mainland exchange and study tours for students through school visits and inspections, collection of student work (including photographs, video clips and student reflections), interviews with teachers and students, etc, and will share students' learning outcomes with the public.

The EDB has all along been actively organising for the benefit of students various kinds of Mainland exchange and study tours, which have gained general support and recognition from schools. The learning outcomes of students are also remarkable. We are looking forward to the continuous support from relevant stakeholders for the Mainland exchange and study tours for students. We will also adhere to our original aspiration and continue to enhance the quality of MEPs for students, and join hands with various stakeholders to achieve more fruitful outcomes."

LCQ2: Increasing Government revenue from land premium,2025-07-23 15:48,2025-07-23 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300549.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Rock Chen and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Development, Mr David Lam, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

Land premium is one of the major revenue sources of the Government. However, there are views pointing out that the current high inventory of new private residential units has reduced developers' willingness to bid for land, apply for payment of land premium and redevelop old buildings. This has led to significant fluctuations in public finances. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will consider introducing targeted measures to lower the initial investment costs for developers' projects, e.g. enhancing the additional conditions for land sales and splitting up sites for sale, etc, as well as stepping up publicity to attract more local and overseas developers to invest in land, thereby increasing the revenue from land premium; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it will re-launch the ""Application List"" system (i.e. the Government puts land up for sale hinges on whether there is any developer triggers a certain piece of land) in order to strike a balance between market demand and the Government's dominant position; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) apart from lowering the application threshold for compulsory sale for the redevelopment of old buildings, will the Government consider adjusting the upper limits of plot ratios in various districts to attract developers to participate in the redevelopment of old buildings by raising the plot ratios of sites earmarked for redevelopment; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government land revenue primarily comes from premium generated from land sales, private treaty grants and lease modifications. The market sentiment can be affected by economic and property market conditions, resulting in fluctuations in land revenue. The Government's policy objective is to maintain a sustained and stable land supply to support society and industry development in Hong Kong. The Government will continuously create land and roll out such land to the market in an orderly manner in light of the latest situation.

Regarding various parts of the Hon Chen's question, the Development Bureau (DEVB)'s reply is as follows:

Firstly, regardless of external environment or property market conditions, the Government will strive to enhance the attractiveness of land sale sites. When formulating the annual land sale list and deciding when to dispose of individual sites to the market, the Government has been closely monitoring market conditions and listening to the views of the industry and potential investors. In recent years, the Government has introduced smaller-scale residential sites located in mature neighbourhood with simple tender terms. The market response has been positive, with all four residential sites successfully tendered out in the previous financial year (2024-25).

Apart from individual land sale sites, we are mindful of the need to alleviate the financial pressure on developers participating in projects of larger scale. Last December, the Government conducted an expressions of interest exercise for three pilot areas under large-scale land disposal in the Northern Metropolis (NM). We have invited the market to provide views on, among other things, various financial arrangements including payment of premium by instalment with certain interest rate. We would liaise with the banking sector on any facilitating arrangements for developers to finance the NM projects. To enhance development incentives of the developers, we will consider allowing land owners to voluntarily surrender land planned to be resumed by the Government in the NM to offset the premium payable for in-situ land exchange or large-scale land disposal in new development areas. In addition, we are exploring wider application of the ""pay for what you build"" approach, which allows developers to pay premium for lease modifications that is determined based on the actual floor area and actual use, thereby reducing their development costs.

On publicity, we held the Enterprise Participation in Northern Metropolis Development Event last November. Over 80 enterprise representatives attended and signed a Memorandum of Understanding about supporting and participating in the NM development. During the ceremony, 35 enterprise representatives also signed agreements among them to collaborate in the NM development, with a total investment of over $100 billion, demonstrating strong confidence and interest in the NM.

We also joined hands with other bureaux, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES) and Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) in promoting the NM and facilitating the development of various industries therein. In particular, OASES is tasked with attracting high-potential and representative strategic enterprises from around the globe, and has announced four batches of 84 strategic enterprises that have set up or expanded their businesses in Hong Kong, many of which have also expressed interest in establishing their presence in the NM. InvestHK, on the other hand, is committed to assisting Mainland and overseas enterprises to set up and expand in Hong Kong by providing one-stop support services. Last year, InvestHK assisted over 500 enterprises to set up or expand in Hong Kong, including those which have expressed interest in the land for industries in the NM. OASES, InvestHK and the Northern Metropolis Co-ordination Office under the DEVB will further collaborate to follow up on the needs of those enterprises interested in setting up businesses in the NM.

Secondly, under the prevailing system, the Government will announce the Land Sale List in advance on a yearly basis, and also the land tender programme on a quarterly basis based on considerations such as policy needs, market conditions and other sources of supply. We consider that the current system enables the Government to assume the lead in land disposal, thereby ensuring that it can increase the supply of land in a stable and prudent manner. At present, the Government has no intention to re-launch the ""Application List"" system, nor does it have any plan to implement a dual-track approach of land sale and adopting the ""Application List"" system, so as not to cause disruption to the Government's strategy and pace regarding land disposal and send confusing signals to the market. If developers are interested in particular sites, they may express their interest to the DEVB through various channels for its reference.

As one of the Government's measures to encourage the private sector to participate in the redevelopment of old buildings, the Land (Compulsory Sale for Redevelopment) (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 (the Amendment Ordinance) was implemented last December to lower the compulsory sale application thresholds and facilitate multiple adjoining-lot compulsory sale applications. Since the implementation of the Amendment Ordinance, the Lands Tribunal has received four compulsory sale applications.

The Government has also implemented other measures in recent years to incentivise the private sector to participate in the redevelopment of old buildings, so as to expedite the pace of urban renewal. For example, we have been progressively implementing the recommendations proposed in the District Study for Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok completed in 2021, including piloting the transfer of plot ratio within the same district and permitting interchangeability of domestic and non-domestic plot ratio, with a view to enhancing the financial viability of redevelopment projects. For the ongoing district studies for Sham Shui Po and Tsuen Wan being undertaken by the Urban Renewal Authority (URA), we would explore the feasibility of adjusting the maximum plot ratio of individual district, as well as increasing the maximum plot ratio of individual old building site upon redevelopment. The URA will submit the Master Renewal Plans to the Government in the second half of this year. Moreover, the DEVB is studying the use of newly developed land to drive large-scale urban redevelopment projects, including considering cross-district transfer of unutilised plot ratio be allowed from old districts to new development areas, and reducing the density of old districts. We will complete the relevant study and put forward preliminary recommendations within this year."
立法會六題：高鐵「靈活行」,2025-07-23 15:35,2025-07-23 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300211.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上張欣宇議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

香港鐵路有限公司（下稱「港鐵公司」）於二○二三年八月為往返廣深港高速鐵路香港西九龍站與福田站的乘客推出「靈活行即日變更車次安排」（下稱「靈活行」），並於去年三月十八日起將該服務擴展至往來深圳北站班次。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉現時適用於「靈活行」的班次數目及其佔所有途經福田站及／或深圳北站班次的百分比，以及該等班次中，使用「靈活行」乘客的平均佔比為何；

（二）是否知悉在二○二三年八月至去年三月十七日，以及去年三月十八日至今，適用於「靈活行」的班次於平日、周末及公眾假期的平均載客率分別為何；及

（三）據悉廣深城際鐵路今年三月全面推行電子客票「當日一次有效」服務，旅客購票後可在乘車日全天乘坐同方向、同等級列車而無需辦理改簽，政府會否要求港鐵公司研究將該票務模式套用至「靈活行」，以便利旅客出行；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

​自廣深港高速鐵路（高鐵）香港段於二○一八年九月二十三日投入服務起，特區政府和高鐵香港段的營運者，即香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司），一直致力提升高鐵服務和優化各項營運安排，務求充分發揮高鐵的社會經濟效益及與全國高鐵網絡互聯互通的優勢。高鐵香港段連接現時超過四萬七千公里的國家高鐵網絡，西九龍站的直達內地站點由開通初期的44個，增加超過一倍至現時96個，包括11個短途站點和85個長途站點；每天開行的班次亦由開初的166班，增至現時至少208班。除了陸續增加站點外，港鐵公司亦積極和內地鐵路單位探討各項多元化的高鐵列車服務和產品，便利旅客和滿足他們不同的需要。當中包括為短途旅客的行程安排提供更大彈性的「靈活行」即日變更車次安排（「靈活行」）；為經常往返兩地的旅客提供車票優惠的多程票，包括「30日定期票」及「20次計次票」；以及為長途旅客提供多一種出行體驗的「夕發朝至」臥鋪列車。無論是短途、長途、商務、旅遊、探親，高鐵均能滿足旅客的不同需要，推動兩地越趨頻繁的來往。

就張欣宇議員的提問，經諮詢港鐵公司，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）「靈活行」於二○二三年八月十四日首次推出，為一項嶄新的票務安排，讓往返西九龍站與福田站的乘客靈活變更即日的車次。旅客除了可按照「一般改票」安排在列車出發前免費改票一次之外，亦可於乘車當日透過「靈活行」額外變更最多三次乘車車次。此安排於二○二四年三月十八日起擴展至直接往返西九龍站與深圳北站，以及經停福田站往返深圳北站為終點站的班次。「靈活行」適用的班次亦設有「無預留座位」安排，以提供較大空間和彈性讓乘客調動車次。

根據港鐵公司提供的資料，由二○二五年七月一日起，西九龍站每日有109班列車經停或以福田站為起點／終點站，當中74班列車可使用「靈活行」，佔總數近七成；另外有167班列車經停或以深圳北站為起點／終點站，當中60班列車可以使用「靈活行」，佔總數約四成。整體而言，「靈活行」適用的列車班次共有98班。

據港鐵公司評估，在引入「靈活行」安排後，有關列車班次的整體乘客量有所增加，說明「靈活行」是有助吸引更多旅客乘搭高鐵的其中一個因素。首階段「靈活行」適用班次的載客率平均約四成，在第二階段擴展至深圳北站後，載客率亦維持相若；當中在周末和公眾假期的相關載客率平均近六成。在「靈活行」適用的列車班次中，使用「靈活行」的乘客平均佔該等班次總乘客量近一成。

（三）香港和內地兩地人員往來越趨頻繁，高鐵香港段開通，實現了大灣區「一小時生活圈」，而「靈活行」服務更能便利旅客彈性出行，是高鐵香港段服務的一大突破。特區政府和港鐵公司亦一直積極檢視如何進一步為旅客帶來更大的便利。

據我們了解，中國鐵路廣州局集團有限公司於二○二五年三月在運行於廣州市和深圳市之間的廣深城際鐵路，推出電子客票「當日一次有效」服務。簡單而言，乘客憑「當日一次有效」車票，可以按自己出行需要選擇乘坐當天任何一班同方向、同等級的列車。這安排省卻了乘客改簽車票班次的手續，可以更加彈性選乘不同列車，為乘客帶來更大便利。

在廣深城際鐵路推出這項票務安排後，港鐵公司隨即與內地相關單位，了解在高鐵香港段引入類似安排的可行性。特區政府認同港鐵公司繼續探討便利旅客出行的不同措施。我們知悉港鐵公司最近已積極與內地相關單位研究有關安排的細節，當中亦會顧及到高鐵香港段所涉及的通關流程、票務安排、列車營運安全等考慮。

特區政府和港鐵公司會與內地鐵路單位及相關部門保持溝通及協調，持續提升高鐵香港段的服務，繼續為旅客提供便捷、舒適的服務。

多謝主席。"

LCQ6: Flexi-trip Arrangement for High Speed Rail,2025-07-23 15:35,2025-07-23 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300275.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Gary Zhang a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

The MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) launched in August 2023 the Same-day Flexi-trip Arrangement (Flexi-trip) for passengers travelling between Hong Kong West Kowloon Station and Futian Station of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link. The service has been extended to include train trips running to and from Shenzhenbei Station since March 18 last year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the current number of Flexi-trip-applicable train trips, its percentage in the total number of train trips running via Futian Station and/or Shenzhenbei Station, and the average proportion of passengers utilising Flexi-trip among such train trips;

(2) whether it knows the average occupancy rates of Flexi-trip-applicable train trips during weekdays, weekends and public holidays respectively from August 2023 to March 17 last year, and from March 18 last year to the present; and

(3) as it is learnt that the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Intercity Railway fully implemented the electronic ticket ""valid once throughout the ticketed date"" services in March this year, allowing passengers who have purchased their tickets to travel on trains of the same direction and of the same class throughout the ticketed date without having to alter tickets, whether the Government will require MTRCL to study applying this ticketing model to Flexi-trip so as to facilitate passenger travel; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Since the commissioning of the Hong Kong Section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL) on September 23, 2018, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government and the operator of the XRL Hong Kong Section, i.e. the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL), have all along been committed to enhancing the services and operational arrangements of the XRL, with a view to fully realising its socio-economic benefits and the advantages of interconnectivity with the national high-speed rail network. The XRL Hong Kong Section connects with the national high speed rail network, which currently spans over 47 000 kilometres. The number of Mainland destinations directly accessible from West Kowloon Station has more than doubled from 44 in the initial commissioning to 96, including 11 short-haul destinations and 85 long-haul destinations. The number of train trips operated per day has also increased from 166 in the initial stage to at least 208 currently. Apart from gradually introducing more destinations, the MTRCL has been actively exploring the provision of diversified XRL train services and products with the Mainland railway authorities, with a view to providing convenience to passengers and meeting their different needs. Of these, there are Same-day Flexi-trip Arrangement (Flexi-trip Arrangement) that provides greater flexibility in journey planning for short-haul travellers; multiple journey tickets, such as the 30-day Ticket and 20-ride Ticket, for frequent travellers commuting between the two places; and sleeper train service running in the mode of evening departures and morning arrivals that provides an alternative travelling experience to long-haul travellers. The XRL caters for the different needs of travellers ranging from short-haul and long-haul trips to business, leisure, and family visits, facilitating more frequent flow of people between the two places.

In consultation with the MTRCL, my consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Gary Zhang is as follows:

(1) and (2) The Flexi-trip Arrangement, first introduced on August 14, 2023, was a new ticketing arrangement, allowing passengers travelling between West Kowloon Station and Futian Station to flexibly alter their train trips on the same day. Apart from altering their tickets once for free before train departure through the General Ticket Alteration arrangement, passengers are also allowed to alter their train trips for up to three times on the day of travel through the Flexi-trip Arrangement. Since March 18, 2024, the arrangement has been extended to cover direct trains running between West Kowloon Station and Shenzhenbei Station, and trains departing from or terminating at Shenzhenbei Station that call at Futian Station. ""Non-reserved Seats"" are also available for train trips covered by the Flexi-trip Arrangement to provide more room and flexibility to passengers in altering their train trips.

According to the information provided by the MTRCL, starting from July 1, 2025, there is a daily total of 109 train trips at West Kowloon Station calling at, departing from or terminating at Futian Station, with 74 of these train trips open for the Flexi-trip Arrangement, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of the total; and 167 trains calling at, departing from or terminating at Shenzhenbei Station, with 60 of these trains open for Flexi-trip Arrangement, accounting for about 40 per cent of the total. Overall, Flexi-trip Arrangement is applicable to a total of 98 train trips.

Based on the MTRCL's assessment, after the introduction of the Flexi-trip Arrangement, the overall patronage of the relevant train trips has increased, suggesting that Flexi-trip Arrangement is one of the factors attracting more passengers to take the XRL. The average loading of the Flexi-trip Arrangement-applicable train trips was about 40 per cent for the first phase, and remained at similar level after the extension of the arrangement to Shenzhenbei Station in the second phase, among which the related loading was nearly 60 per cent on average during weekends and public holidays. Of the train trips applicable for Flexi-trip Arrangement, passengers using Flexi-trip Arrangement account for an average of nearly 10 per cent of the total patronage of these trips.

(3) With the increasingly frequent flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland, the commissioning of the XRL Hong Kong Section has realised the ""one-hour living circle"" in the Greater Bay Area. The Flexi-trip Arrangement further facilitates the flexible travel of visitors, marking a significant breakthrough in the services of the XRL Hong Kong Section. The HKSAR Government and the MTRCL have been actively reviewing how to further bring greater convenience to visitors.

As we understand, the China Railway Guangzhou Group Company Limited introduced the ""Same-day One-time Valid"" electronic ticket service on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Intercity Railway running between Guangzhou and Shenzhen in March 2025. In short, passengers with a ""Same-day One-Time Valid"" ticket can choose to take any train of the same direction and class on the same day according to their travel needs. This arrangement saves passengers the hassle of altering their train ticket, enabling more flexibility in choosing different trains and bringing greater convenience to passengers.

Upon introduction of such ticketing arrangement at the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Intercity Railway, the MTRCL approached the relevant Mainland authorities to explore the feasibility of introducing a similar arrangement in the XRL Hong Kong Section. The HKSAR Government supports the MTRCL to continue exploring various measures to facilitate passengers' travel. We understand that the MTRCL has recently been actively studying the details of the relevant arrangements with relevant Mainland authorities, with due consideration to factors such as the clearance procedures, ticketing arrangements, train operation safety involved in the XRL Hong Kong section, etc.

The HKSAR Government and the MTRCL will maintain communication and co-ordination with the Mainland railway authorities and the relevant departments to continuously enhance the services of the XRL Hong Kong Section, with a view to providing convenient and comfortable services to passengers.

Thank you, President."
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-07-23 15:35,2025-07-23 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300566.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 22 to noon today (July 23), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 154 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit.

答覆：

主席：

就郭玲麗議員提問，經徵詢醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）至（六）推動戒煙是控煙策略的重要一環，衞生署負責協調本港提供的戒煙服務。衞生署除了設有綜合戒煙熱線處理有關戒煙的一般查詢和提供專業輔導，亦與本地大學合作設立熱線，特別為年輕的吸煙人士提供電話輔導服務。二○二二年至二○二四年間，衞生署綜合戒煙熱線分別處理了7 404個、9 684個和9 297個查詢，滿意度調查結果顯示超過九成受訪的服務使用者對服務整體滿意。

戒煙服務方面，衞生署與非政府機構合作，提供免費和便捷的社區為本戒煙服務，包括輔導和由西醫（包括免費郵遞戒煙藥物服務）或中醫診症，以及為少數族裔、新移民、青少年和工作間的吸煙人士提供特定服務。衞生署會安排轉介吸煙者接受本港各類戒煙服務，包括上述社區為本戒煙服務或由醫管局轄下診所提供的戒煙服務。醫管局轄下的戒煙診所亦會幫助醫管局病人（特別是患有慢性疾病的患者）戒煙。戒煙服務提供者會為接受戒煙治療的吸煙人士提供52周的跟進服務，以評估他們的戒煙情況。衞生署亦推出「戒煙達人」應用程式，戒煙人士可透過應用程式評估其尼古丁的依賴程度、訂下戒煙計劃、記下戒煙進度和取得對抗煙癮的貼士，協助維持無煙生活。

二○二二年至二○二四年間，20 389名、27 709名和28 559名吸煙人士分別透過醫管局轄下的戒煙診所或社區為本戒煙服務接受戒煙服務（詳見附件）。服務使用者於開始戒煙後52周成功戒煙的比率（即服務使用者匯報自己錄得過去七天沒有吸煙的百分比）由20%至60%不等（註），與海外國家的數字相若，而衞生署和醫管局未有備存有關成功戒煙人士的復吸煙率相關數據。

政府於去年六月宣布「控煙十招」，當中建議加強戒煙服務。現時戒煙服務已經擴展至全港十八區的地區康健中心／地區康健站，以便利戒煙者尋找最適合和便捷的戒煙方法。衞生署亦於今年資助多三個中醫戒煙服務提供者（由一個增至四個）營運以輔導和針灸戒煙為主的戒煙診所。社區為本戒煙服務下中西醫戒煙服務預計每年可用服務名額分別增至約2 600和4 000個。

戒煙是一個具動態性的過程，成效會受社會和環境因素影響，例如過去數次增加煙草稅的經驗顯示，加稅幅度越大，致電戒煙熱線人數越多。另一方面，宣傳教育工作對協助吸煙人士成功戒煙尤為重要，因此「控煙十招」亦建議加強宣傳教育。衞生署致力推廣無煙文化，包括於大眾媒體和宣傳活動推動戒煙。該署自二○二一年推出「六月．戒煙月」活動，及後開始向有吸煙習慣的人士免費提供一星期戒煙藥物（尼古丁替代療法）試用裝，鼓勵吸煙人士嘗試戒煙和增加戒煙成功率，更新增中醫戒煙耳穴貼試用計劃，大部分試用耳穴貼的吸煙者認為有助於紓緩退癮徵狀。每年「六月．戒煙月」活動推行後，戒煙熱線電話查詢數字均明顯上升，可見吸煙人士的戒煙意欲有所上升。

戒煙對任何年齡的吸煙人士均帶來裨益。目前已有多種被證實有效的戒煙療法，研究顯示通過輔導和藥物治療，戒煙成功率會大大增加。通過個人化和具針對性的戒煙服務，醫護人員將更有效協助吸煙者戒除煙癮，同時幫助政府更精準地推動戒煙。政府會繼續支援有意戒煙人士，亦會按需要持續投放資源加強戒煙服務和宣傳推廣工作，守護市民的健康。

（七）二○二三年主題性住戶統計調查（主題性調查）結果顯示，本港習慣每日吸食傳統捲煙的15歲及以上人士中，超過九成是受家人、朋友或其他人影響而開始吸煙。有鑑於此，政府一直積極進行公眾教育工作，推廣無煙環境。衞生署與香港吸煙與健康委員會、非政府機構和醫護專業人員合作針對年輕人宣揚無煙信息，包括聯同地區服務團體透過戒煙比賽、健康講座、訓練計劃和劇場節目，並透過互動教材和活動教室，向學生揭示煙草業推銷煙草產品的伎倆，以及教導他們抵抗朋輩壓力以拒絕染上吸煙習慣的技巧。

主題性調查結果顯示，越年輕的組別吸食加味煙的比率越高，而首次吸煙時吸食加味煙的比率亦接近七成。科學證據說明添加了味道如薄荷或水果味的煙會降低對煙草危害的意識，增加非吸煙人士（特別是青少年）開始吸煙的機會，並令他們的煙癮更深和更難戒除。另外，醫務衞生局委託香港大學公共衞生學院於二○二三年進行有關學生吸煙情況的學校統計調查結果發現有吸食電子煙的中學生和吸食傳統捲煙的中學生比率相若（分別為1.1%），顯示電子煙在吸煙產品當中受年輕人群組歡迎。有研究指出電子煙可成為吸傳統捲煙的入門途徑。就此，「控煙十招」當中包括禁止加味傳統吸煙產品、禁止管有另類吸煙產品，以及禁止向18歲以下人士提供傳統吸煙產品和另類吸煙產品等。

政府會繼續深化戒煙工作，並探討各項中、長期控煙措施，以循序漸進、多管齊下的方式，全方位杜絕煙草製品對社會的禍害，保障市民的健康，邁向「無煙香港」。

註：不同戒煙計劃的服務對象和治療方法（例如：輔導、藥物治療、中醫針灸等）有異，因此所錄得的戒煙率亦有所不同，吸煙人士應選擇最切合個人需要的戒煙服務／方法，以期成功戒煙。"
LCQ12: Smoking cessation support services and tobacco control education,2025-07-23 15:30,2025-07-23 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300337.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lillian Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that among the many tobacco control measures implemented by the Government in recent years, smoking cessation support services and education are of great importance. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the number of persons served by the smoking cessation clinics under the Hospital Authority in each month of the past three years, as well as such persons' success rate of quitting smoking;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the relapse rate for the persons who successfully quit smoking as mentioned in (1), and whether it has provided them with follow-up and support services; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) of the following information on the provision of community-based smoking cessation services by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) subvented by the Department of Health in the past three years: the names of such NGOs, the types of services provided, the number of participants in the smoking cessation services and, among them, the numbers of those who completed the smoking cessation service programme and successfully quit smoking, as well as those who failed to complete the entire service programme;

(4) whether it has conducted survey on the levels of satisfaction of smoking cessation service users with the various smoking cessation support services (such as smoking cessation counselling services, medications, and smoking cessation services with Chinese medicine and acupuncture) and collected relevant feedback; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) whether it has compiled statistics on the ratios of different smoking cessation treatments used in Hong Kong at present;

(6) whether it has compiled statistics on and assessed the relationship between the allocation of public resources and the effectiveness of smoking cessation services; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(7) whether it has studied and analysed the reasons for smoking among minors and adults respectively; if so, of the details, and how its future tobacco control education and publicity strategies will tie in with the findings of the relevant studies; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Hospital Authority (HA), the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Lillian Kwok is as follows:

(1) to (6) Promoting smoking cessation is an important pillar under the tobacco control strategy. The Department of Health (DH) is responsible for co-ordinating smoking cessation services in Hong Kong. In addition to operating the Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline that handles general enquiries and provides professional counselling on smoking cessation, the DH also collaborates with local universities for setting up hotlines to provide telephone-counselling services especially for young smokers. From 2022 to 2024, the Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline of the DH handled 7 404, 9 684, and 9 297 enquiries respectively. Satisfaction survey results revealed that over 90 per cent of the service recipients interviewed were satisfied with the service in general.

  On smoking cessation service, the DH collaborates with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in providing free and accessible community-based smoking cessation services including counselling service and consultations by doctors (with free postal services of smoking cessation medication) or Chinese medicine practitioners, and designated services for smokers from different ethnicities, as well as immigrant, teenager and workplace smokers. The DH arranges referrals for smokers to access various local smoking cessation services, including the aforementioned community-based smoking cessation services or those provided by clinics under the HA. The smoking cessation clinics under the HA will also assist HA's patients (especially those with chronic diseases) in quitting smoking. Smoking cessation service providers provides smokers receiving smoking cessation treatment with 52-week follow-up services to assess their quit status. The DH also launched the ""Quit Smoking App"", through which smokers can assess their nicotine dependence level, set quit plan, record quitting progress and get tips on how to deal with smoking craving, which would help maintain a smoke-free life.

  From 2022 to 2024, 20 389, 27 709, and 28 559 smokers received smoking cessation services respectively through HA's smoking cessation clinics or community-based smoking cessation services (see Annex). The quit rates of service users (i.e. the percentage of service users who self-reported to have stayed quit in the past seven days) at 52 weeks after the quit date ranged from 20 per cent to 60 per cent (Note), which are comparable to those in overseas countries. The DH and HA do not maintain relevant data on the relapse rates among successful quitters.

  The Government announced in June last year ""10 measures for tobacco control"", which include strengthening smoking cessation services. Currently, smoking cessation services have been extended to cover all District Health Centres (DHCs)/DHC Expresses across 18 districts in Hong Kong with a view to facilitating quitters in finding the most suitable and convenient way to quit smoking. The DH has also subvented three more Chinese medicine smoking cessation service providers (from one to four in total) starting from this year to operate smoking cessation clinics with an emphasis on counselling and acupuncture. The available service quotas for Chinese and Western medicine smoking cessation services under the community-based smoking cessation services are expected to increase to approximately 2 600 and 4 000 per annum respectively.

  Smoking cessation is a dynamic process, and its effectiveness is influenced by social and environmental factors. For example, past experience from increasing tobacco duty shows that the greater the tax hike, the larger the number of calls received by the smoking cessation hotline. On the other hand, publicity and educational efforts are critical to assisting smokers to quit smoking successfully. Therefore, it is recommended under the ""10 measures for tobacco control"" to also strengthen publicity and education. The DH is committed to promoting a smoke-free culture, including promoting smoking cessation through mass media and promotional campaigns. The DH has launched the Quit in June campaign since 2021, and subsequently started distributing one-week trial packs of smoking cessation drugs (nicotine replacement therapy) to smokers for free with a view to encouraging smokers to attempt quitting and increasing the success rate, as well as introduced a trial programme on the use of Chinese medicine ear-point patches for smoking cessation. Most of the smokers who have tried the ear-point patches consider them useful in relieving the withdrawal symptoms. Following the Quit in June campaign each year, the number of calls to the smoking cessation hotline has significantly increased, indicating an uptick in smokers' intentions to quit.

  Smoking cessation is beneficial to smokers of any age. There is a wide range of smoking cessation therapies that have been proven effective. Studies show that counselling and pharmacotherapy can boost the quit rate substantially. Through personalised and targeted smoking cessation services, healthcare professionals can better assist smokers in quitting smoking, and at the same time help the Government to promote smoking cessation more precisely. The Government will continue to support smokers intending to quit smoking and allocate resources as needed to strengthen smoking cessation services as well as publicity and promotional efforts, thereby safeguarding public health.

(7) The results of the Thematic Household Survey (THS) in 2023 showed that among the daily smokers of conventional cigarettes aged 15 and above in Hong Kong, over 90 per cent started smoking due to the influence of family, friends, or others. As such, the Government has actively engaged in public education for promoting a smoke-free environment. The DH, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health, NGOs and healthcare professionals, have targeted young people on promoting anti-smoking messages, including organising smoking cessation competitions, health talks, training programmes and theatre programmes with local service groups; and through interactive teaching materials and mobile classrooms, revealing to students the tactics used by the tobacco industry to promote tobacco products and equipping them with the skills to resist picking up smoking habit when under peer pressure.

  The findings of the THS showed that the younger the age group, the higher the rate of smoking flavoured cigarettes, and nearly 70 per cent smoked flavoured cigarettes when they first smoked. Scientific evidence shows that flavoured cigarettes, such as menthol or fruit-flavoured cigarettes, reduce the awareness of the hazards of tobacco and increase the chances of non-smokers (especially teenagers) to start smoking, as well as making them more vulnerable to continuing with the smoking habit and harder to quit. Besides, the findings of the school-based surveys on smoking pattern of students as commissioned by the Health Bureau and conducted by the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong in 2023 revealed that the ratio of secondary school students who currently smoke electronic cigarettes to those who smoke conventional cigarettes was similar (1.1 per cent each), indicating that e-cigarettes, among other smoking products, are particularly popular amongst the younger generation. Research suggests that e-cigarettes can serve as a gateway to smoking conventional cigarette. In this connection, the ""10 measures for tobacco control"" include banning flavoured conventional smoking products, banning the possession of alternative smoking products (ASPs), as well as prohibiting the provision of conventional smoking products and ASPs to persons aged below 18.

  The Government will continue to step up the work on smoking cessation and explore various tobacco control measures in the medium and long term in order to eliminate the hazards posed by tobacco products on the society in all aspects and protect the health of the community under a progressive and multi-pronged approach with a view to moving towards a tobacco-free Hong Kong.

Note: The quit rates recorded by different smoking cessation programmes vary due to differences in target groups and treatment methods (for example counselling, pharmacotherapy and Chinese medicine and acupuncture). Smokers should choose the smoking cessation service/method that best suits their personal needs in order to quit smoking successfully."

LCQ3: Village land and Small House Policy,2025-07-23 15:00,2025-07-23 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300484.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Junius Ho and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Development, Mr David Lam, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

Article 40 of the Basic Law stipulates that the lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the ""New Territories"" shall be protected by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. According to the Court of Final Appeal's judgment in 2021, all components under the Small House Policy are lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories. However, there are views that the existing Small House Policy, which has been in force for over 50 ‍years, has become outdated in terms of its implementation and details. Regarding village land and the Small House Policy, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has recently reviewed the Small House Policy for indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) given that according to the paper submitted by the Government to the Panel on Development of this Council in December last year, the Government has commenced a consultancy study on how to promote urban-rural integration in the entire Northern Metropolis, which will include formulating guidelines on implementation of urban-rural integration, of the progress of the relevant work and the specific measures in place to promote village participation in development, so as to unleash land potential; and

(3) given that some members of the community have put forward a proposal for ""ding"" buildings, which involves pooling the rights and interests of various indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories in building small houses (commonly known as ""ding"" rights) to develop modern apartment buildings, whether the Government will take this proposal into consideration?

Reply:

President,

The New Territories Small House Policy has been implemented since 1972, to allow a male indigenous villager aged 18 years old or above who is descended through the male line from a resident in 1898 of a recognised village in the New Territories to apply for permission to erect, for once in his lifetime, a small house for himself on a suitable site within his own village.

In response to the respective parts raised by Dr the Hon Ho, our reply is as follows:

(1) The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ruled on the judicial review of the Small House Policy in 2021, confirming that all components under the Small House Policy, namely Free Building Licence, Private Treaty Grant and Land Exchange, are lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories within the meaning of Article 40 of the Basic Law. In view of the historical background of the Small House Policy, having been in operation for many years, and that the CFA has upheld its lawfulness and compatibility with the Basic Law, we currently have no plans to review the relevant policy.

That being said, we appreciate the needs for eligible New Territories indigenous villagers to build small houses. Since 2021, the Government has streamlined the procedures for processing small house applications with a view to expediting approvals under the existing policy framework, including processing procedures under various aspects in parallel, simplifying the procedures for handling objections and conducting face-to-face meetings with applicants for direct discussion.

The above measures have gradually shown results. The average number of small house applications processed by the Lands Department (LandsD) each year increased to more than 2 500 cases in the years from 2022 to 2024, surpassing its performance pledge of 2 300 cases, while the number of applications approved per year also increased from over 500 in 2022 to over 800 in 2024, representing an increase of more than 55 per cent.

In addition, to expedite the development of small houses, the LandsD implemented in January this year, on a pilot basis, a self-certification scheme at the District Lands Office (DLO), Yuen Long, which allows lot owners to appoint registered professionals at their own expense to prepare and submit the relevant documents for self-certification of compliance of relevant approval requirements, thereby leveraging the resources in the industry and expediting the approval process. The LandsD will also streamline and expedite the approval process for applications submitted under the scheme with the target of completing the processing of cases within 10 weeks upon receipt of all required documents. The LandsD has extended the coverage of the scheme to DLO, North in July this year.

(2) The Northern Metropolis (NM) possesses many historical and traditional rural townships and precious natural ecology, which are embedded with rich historical and cultural resources. ""Urban-rural integration"" is one of the key focuses in the development of the NM. In planning new development areas, we will preserve the layout and appearance of traditional villages. Through proper planning to soften the urban-rural interface, we can integrate new development areas and the rural areas in harmony. The villagers will also benefit from new transport and other infrastructure and facilities, as well as new and diverse employment opportunities. With a view to bringing new business opportunities to villages and facilitating visitors to experience the rural culture, we are exploring further facilitation measures under the prevailing Small House Policy to encourage an appropriate provision of village shops, restaurants and home-stay lodging facilities. We will also appropriately conserve and revitalise historical buildings and provide venues for carrying out traditional activities to promote cultural heritage. By combining tourism resources such as natural ecology and historical buildings, we can promote ""tourism is everywhere"" and enrich the rural living experience.

The Government has engaged a consultant to formulate the policies and approaches to further promote ""urban-rural integration"" in the development of the NM. During the process, various stakeholders including the villagers would be consulted. We will report the progress to the Legislative Council at an appropriate juncture.

(3) The intent of the Small House Policy is to enable the habitation of indigenous inhabitants in low-density village environments. The permission of ""ding"" buildings or high-density development is not compatible with the policy intention. The existing legislation has also set out clear rules regarding development of small houses. In accordance with the Buildings Ordinance (Application to the New Territories) Ordinance (Cap. 121), a small house shall neither contain more than three storeys nor exceed a height of 8.23 metres (27 feet) and the maximum roofed-over area of the house shall not exceed 65.03 square metres (700 square feet). From a planning perspective, land originally planned for low-rise and low-density development may not be suitable for high-rise and high-density development.

Hence, whether seen from either the policy, legal or planning perspective, the ""ding"" building proposal will represent a significant deviation from or change to the prevailing arrangements for small houses. Separately, the Government is taking forward the development of the NM in full force. The NM closely relates to the overall public interest and, upon its full development, will supply 3 000 hectares of land with 500 000 new housing units for members of the public from all walks of life, and provide substantial land for industry development and create diverse employment opportunities. Development of the NM is both a consensus of our society and the priority of the Government. Given its controversy, we therefore do not consider it appropriate to consider the ""ding"" building proposal at this juncture, as doing so will invariably spark discussion and divert the Government's efforts and resources.

Thank you, President."

立法會二十題︰培育環境、社會及管治人才,2025-07-23 14:25,2025-07-23 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300399.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上陳紹雄議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆：

問題：

近年環境、社會及管治（ESG）成為全球發展核心策略，香港亦積極推動《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》（《藍圖》）及綠色和可持續金融的發展。據報有研究顯示全港僅百分之二十七的中學在學校發展計劃提及可持續發展、氣候及生物多樣性相關的內容，反映本港培養ESG人才與公民意識方面仍有不足之處。而根據2023年人力推算報告，勞工及福利局亦預算ESG屬於未來就業市場必備知識。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於《藍圖》表示當局會在學校層面提升教師對氣候變化的知識，學校可在不同科目加強相關的學習內容，但上述研究結果顯示該等工作的成效似乎未能達致，當局有否評估學校在氣候變化和生物多樣性等方面的教育成效為何；

（二）當局有否考慮再加強中學對ESG（例如氣候行動和社會責任等）方面的教育，並制訂跨學科的教學指引；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於《藍圖》曾提及大專院校的課程需增潤與氣候變化、低碳技術和綠色金融等相關的學習內容，當局有否評估相關學院課程能否達到培訓ESG人才的需求；如何確保學生具備ESG素養以迎合未來職場需求，助力香港發展為區域綠色金融中心；及

（四）針對本港目前就業市場的勞動人口，當局有否計劃推廣ESG教育普及化，協助市民增加ESG方面的知識，以應付未來的就業市場需要；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳紹雄議員的提問，經諮詢環境及生態局、勞工及福利局、以及財經事務及庫務局後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）教育局十分重視推動可持續發展教育，一直提倡學校以「多重進路」、「互相配合」方式，通過不同科目和跨學科學習，以及全方位學習活動，幫助學生加深對可持續發展的認識，實踐綠色生活。相關的學習元素，包括氣候行動、生物多樣性、可再生能源、節能減廢、善用資源、企業的社會責任等，已蘊含於各學科的課程指引，例如小學人文科、小學科學科、中學的地理科、科學科、生物科、企業、會計與財務概論課程、公民與社會發展科及部分應用學習課程等。

可持續發展教育是中小學價值觀教育的重要一環，貫穿不同學科教育範疇。《價值觀教育課程架構（試行版）》的學習期望建議包括「積極實踐環保的生活習慣，鼓勵和支持身邊的人一起參與」、「具備國際視野，關心世界環境議題及可持續發展所面對的挑戰」，鼓勵學生承擔保護環境的責任，培養他們尊重、感恩和關愛大自然等正確價值觀和態度。

為支援教師進行可持續發展教育，教育局持續舉辦不同的教師專業發展課程，通過實地考察及講座，加深他們對可持續發展教育及相關課題的認識，提升教學能量。自二○二○／二一學年至今，教育局已舉辦近200場相關培訓活動，逾12 300教師人次參與。教育局亦與香港電台第三台合作，在製作的英語學習節目""In the Common Room""中，加入探究環境、社會及管治（ESG）議題的環節""Savvy Earth Savers""，為教師提供英語教學資源，推動可持續發展教育。

教育局亦舉辦多元化的學生活動，如標語及海報設計比賽、繪畫及攝影比賽、繪本創作比賽等，幫助學生了解可持續發展的理念和重要性，豐富他們的學習經歷。為進一步推動可持續發展教育，教育局在本學年首次舉辦「2024／25邁向碳中和學生校園大使培訓計劃」，與不同政府部門、綠色團體及商界攜手舉辦形式多樣的體驗式學習活動，包括銀行參訪、考察珊瑚保育、探索綠色建築等，加深學生對綠色金融及智能綠建的認識，了解海洋生物多樣性的重要性。建基首年舉辦大使計劃的經驗，教育局會繼續與不同持份者合作，為學生提供更多學習機會，讓他們進一步認識政府和社會各界為香港達成碳中和目標而作出的努力。

在校本管理下，學校制訂學校發展計劃時，須配合辦學宗旨、教育最新發展，以及考慮校情，以釐定清晰的發展方向和聚焦的重點發展工作。學校推動可持續發展教育多年，進展良好，普遍已恆常推展相關工作，如有新的發展重點、策略或措施，會按情況載於學校發展計劃內。

此外，相關政策局和部門也一直積極推動多項教育及宣傳計劃，增進學生對可持續發展的認識，包括：

（i）環境及生態局通過可持續發展學校外展計劃和可持續發展學校獎勵計劃，舉辦不同類型及題材的講座、工作坊、實地考察和互動話劇等活動，向中學生推廣可持續發展的理念和實踐，同時表揚學校和學生在社區推廣可持續發展方面的努力。在二○二四／二五學年，可持續發展學校外展計劃以廚餘減廢與回收為主題，共有231間學校參與，合共約有82 000名師生參與。

（ii）環境保護署（環保署）透過「惜食香港運動」的宣傳教育活動，再配合「大嘥鬼」的角色，鼓勵學生從源頭減少廚餘，培養惜食習慣。運動為學校提供免費講座，講解廚餘的挑戰、減量方法和回收計劃等，以提升學生對廚餘議題的認識。在二○二四／二五學年，環保署已為46間幼稚園、中小學舉辦講座，受惠學生接近一萬人。

環保署也在二○二四年推出「回收@校園」活動，透過向全港中小學校提供多元化教材、推廣配套和教師培訓，協助學校和教師把減廢回收的知識融入日常教學，鼓勵學生善用學校和社區的回收設施，並帶動家人一起實踐資源分類回收。「回收@校園」活動項目自推出以來反應熱烈，至今共有約550間中小學參與計劃，涵蓋約35萬名學生。此外，在二○二五年一月至五月間，環保署聯同「綠在區區」營辦團體已合共舉辦超過460場學校參與或合辦的減廢回收宣傳活動，提升學生的環保意識。

（iii）渠務署一直透過舉辦污水處理設施導賞活動，支援學校推廣環境保護教育。舉例來說，學生可透過參觀渠務署昂船洲污水處理廠和沙田污水處理廠等設施，了解污水處理流程、能源效益設計和氣候變化應對措施。

（三）教育局一直支持專上院校參考政府不同政策部門提出的人力需求建議，開辦配合香港社會和經濟需要的專上課程。為了迎合持續發展而不斷轉變的社會需要，大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學近年開設多個與「環境、社會、治理」相關的資助課程，培育學生成為可持續發展與綠色金融的人才。在二○二四／二五學年，已開設約40個本科及研究生課程。教育局及教資會將繼續鼓勵大學培育人才以應對增長、轉型及未來挑戰，滿足香港未來發展的人才需求。各自資院校亦可靈活開辦符合市場需要的課程，以及調整相關課程的內容及學額，以回應社會不同界別不斷轉變的人力需求，並提供多元的升學出路。

（四）各政策局及部門因應各行業最新發展及人力需求情況，提供相應的本地人才培訓計劃，充實本地的人力資源。

政府於二○二二年推出了「綠色和可持續金融培訓先導計劃」（先導計劃），供本地合資格從業員、相關專業人士和修讀相關學科的學生及畢業生申請。現時，合資格培訓課程及資歷達94個，當中包括與銀行服務、資產管理，以及保險業等相關的綠色和可持續金融培訓及資歷，由本地大學的專業進修學院、專業機構、國際培訓機構等提供，並會不斷更新。截至二○二五年五月，已有超過7 200宗發還款項申請獲成功審批，涉及的總資助金額超過4,000萬元。為持續支持本地綠色金融人才的培訓，先導計劃會延長至二○二八年。

此外，由相關政府政策局、金融監管機構，以及香港交易及結算所有限公司組成的綠色和可持續金融跨機構督導小組（督導小組）於二○二二年十月推出可持續金融實習計劃，為學生創造更多本地的相關實習機會。督導小組成員亦定期舉辦培訓座談會和論壇，並邀請金融監管機構的代表和來自學界及業界的專家作講解，以加深大學生和業界對可持續金融的了解。

環保署一直支持本港環境專業的持續發展，讓環境相關的服務和產業能透過專業化提升水平和公信力。環保署正探討與「香港合資格環保專業人員學會」合作，提供ESG相關培訓，以配合ESG領域快速發展和不斷增加的人才需求。此外，持續進修基金下培訓機構因應市場發展和需要開辦相關課程，目前主要由大專院校提供，而僱員再培訓局亦有提供相關課程。"
"LCQ20: Nurturing environmental, social and governance talents",2025-07-23 14:25,2025-07-23 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300401.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Siu-hung and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

  In recent years, environmental, social and governance (ESG) has become a core strategy for global development, and Hong Kong has also been actively promoting Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050 (Plan) and the development of green and sustainable finance. It has been reported that according to a study, only 27 per cent of the secondary schools in Hong Kong have included references to matters relating to sustainable development, climate and biodiversity in their school development plans, reflecting that there are still inadequacies in the nurturing of ESG talents and civic awareness in Hong Kong. According to the Report on 2023 Manpower Projection, the Labour and Welfare Bureau has also envisaged that ESG will be deemed essential knowledge in the future employment market. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is stated in the Plan that the authorities will broaden school teachers' knowledge about climate change, and that schools may strengthen the relevant learning materials in different subjects, but the findings of the aforesaid study have revealed that such efforts seem to have failed to achieve the intended results, whether the authorities have assessed the effectiveness of schools' education on climate change and biodiversity, etc;

(2) whether the authorities have considered further strengthening education on ESG (e.g. climate actions and social responsibilities) in secondary schools, and formulating interdisciplinary teaching guidelines; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as the Plan has mentioned the need to incorporate learning materials relating to climate change, low-carbon technologies and green finance, etc, into the curricula in tertiary institutions, whether the authorities have assessed if the relevant curricula in the institutions can satisfy the need to train ESG talents; how to ensure that students are equipped with ESG literacy to meet the needs of the future job market, thereby facilitating the development of Hong Kong into a regional green finance centre; and

(4) regarding the workforce in the local employment market at present, whether the authorities have plans to promote the popularisation of ESG education, thereby assisting members of the public in enhancing their ESG knowledge to address the needs of the future employment market; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Regarding the question raised by the Hon Chan Siu-hung, the consolidated reply, after consulting the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Labour and Welfare Bureau, and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, is as follows:

(1) and (2) The Education Bureau (EDB) attaches great importance to promoting education for sustainable development (ESD). It has been encouraging schools to adopt a ""multi-pronged and co-ordinated"" approach to enhance students' understanding of sustainable development (SD) and encourage them to practise green living through different subjects, cross-curricular learning and life-wide learning activities. The relevant learning elements, which include climate action, biodiversity conservation, renewable energy, energy saving and waste reduction, making good use of resources and corporate social responsibilities, have been incorporated in the curriculum guides of various subjects, such as Primary Humanities and Primary Science at the primary level, and Geography, Science, Biology, Business, Accounting and Financial Studies, Citizenship and Social Development as well as some Applied Learning courses at the secondary level.

  ESD is an important component of values education across different subjects in primary and secondary school education. The Values Education Curriculum Framework (Pilot Version) lists ""actively practising green living as well as encouraging and supporting joint efforts from people around"" and ""possessing a global perspective as well as being concerned about global environmental issues and the challenges in attaining sustainable development"" as the expected learning outcomes, encouraging students to take responsibility for environmental conservation and nurturing in them proper values and attitudes, such as respecting, be thankful to and caring about nature.

  To support teachers in implementing ESD, the EDB has organised various teacher professional development programmes. Field studies and seminars have been conducted to deepen teachers' understanding of ESD and related topics as well as enhance their teaching capacity. Since the 2020/21 school year, the EDB has conducted nearly 200 relevant training activities with the number of teacher participation exceeding 12 300. The EDB has also collaborated with Radio Television Hong Kong Radio 3 to produce the ""Savvy Earth Savers"" segment featured in the English learning programme ""In the Common Room”. The segment explores environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and provides teachers with English learning and teaching resources for promoting ESD.

  The EDB has also organised diversified student activities, such as slogan and poster design competitions, drawing and photo-taking competitions and picture book creation competitions, to help students understand the rationale and importance of sustainable development as well as enrich their learning experiences. To further promote ESD, the EDB launched the ""Achieving Carbon Neutrality Student Ambassador Training Scheme 2024/25"" for the first time in this school year. Through the collaborative efforts with different government departments, green groups and the business sector in organising diversified experiential learning activities, such as bank visit, coral conservation field trips and green building tours, the EDB aims to deepen students' understanding of green finance and intelligent green buildings and the importance of marine biodiversity. Building on the first year's experience with the ambassador scheme, the EDB will continue to collaborate with different stakeholders to provide students with more learning opportunities to further increase their understanding of the efforts of the Government and various sectors of society in achieving the target of carbon neutrality in Hong Kong.

  Under school-based management, when formulating the School Development Plan (SDP), schools have to set out a clear direction for development and focused priority tasks, which should be in line with the school's vision and mission, the latest education development, as well as the school context. Schools have been promoting ESD for years with good progress, and have generally taken forward relevant work as the routine ones. If there are new development focuses, strategies or measures, they will be included in the SDP as appropriate.

  Besides, the relevant bureaux and departments have also been actively implementing various education and publicity programmes to enhance students' understanding of SD, including:

(i) The Environment and Ecology Bureau has organised a range of seminars, workshops, field trips and interactive dramas, etc, on various topics through the Sustainable Development School Outreach Programme (Outreach Programme) and the Sustainable Development School Award Programme, so as to promote the concept and practice of SD among secondary students, and at the same time recognise the efforts of schools and students in promoting SD in the community. In the 2024/25 school year, under the theme of Food Waste Reduction and Recycling, the Outreach Programme attracted the participation of 231 schools, encompassing about 82 000 teachers and students.

(ii) The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has been conducting promotional and educational activities through the Food Wise Hong Kong Campaign, along with the Big Waster mascot, to encourage students to reduce food waste at source and cultivate food wise habits. The Campaign provides free seminars to schools on topics such as food waste challenges, reduction methods, and recycling schemes, to enhance students' awareness of the food waste issue. In the 2024/25 school year, the EPD organised seminars for 46 kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, benefiting nearly 10 000 students.

  In 2024, the EPD also launched the ""We-recycle@School"" Activity (the Scheme). Through providing a variety of teaching materials, support and teacher training to primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, the Scheme assists schools and teachers in integrating waste reduction and recycling knowledge into daily teaching, encourage students to make good use of recycling facilities in schools and the community, and motivate their family members to practise resource separation and recycling together. Since its launch, the Scheme has received an overwhelming response, with the participation of about 350 000 students from around 550 primary and secondary schools. In addition, from January to May 2025, the EPD organised in collaboration with GREEN@COMMUNITY operators over 460 publicity activities on waste reduction and recycling involving or co-hosted by schools, thereby raising environmental awareness among students.

(iii) The Drainage Services Department (DSD) has been supporting schools in promoting environmental protection education through organising guided tours at sewage treatment facilities. For instance, students can learn about the sewage treatment process, energy efficiency design and the measures in combating climate change through visits to the DSD's facilities such as the Stonecutters Island Sewage Treatment Works and the Sha Tin Sewage Treatment Works.

(3) The EDB has all along supported post-secondary institutions offering post-secondary programmes that meet the social and economic needs of Hong Kong, having regard to different policy bureaux' and departments' recommendations on manpower needs. In response to the ever-changing social needs for sustainable development, the University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities have offered various funded programmes relevant to ""Environment, Society and Governance"" in recent years, to nurture students to become talents in sustainable development and green finance. In the 2024/25 academic year, there are about 40 programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The EDB and the UGC will continue to encourage universities to nurture talents for growth, transformation and future challenges, and meet Hong Kong's future development's talent needs. Self-financing institutions also have the flexibility to develop programmes that meet market needs, and adjust the curricula and intake places of relevant programmes, in response to the ever-changing manpower needs of different sectors of society, and provide diversified articulation pathways.

(4) Bureaux and departments take forward sector-specific talent training programmes in response to the latest industry development and manpower situation to enrich the local human resources.

  The Government launched in 2022 the Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme (Pilot Scheme) for application by local eligible market practitioners and related professionals as well as students and graduates of relevant disciplines. There are currently 94 eligible programmes and qualifications, including green and sustainable finance programmes and qualifications related to banking services, asset management, insurance industry, etc. These are provided by the professional and continuing education schools of local universities, professional institutions, international training providers, etc, and the list will continue to be updated. As of May 2025, over 7 200 reimbursement applications were approved, involving a total reimbursement amount of over $40 million. To continuously support local green finance talent training, we will extend the Pilot Scheme to 2028.

  Besides, the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group (Steering Group) formed by relevant Government Bureaux, financial regulators and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited launched in October 2022 the Sustainable Finance Internship Initiative to create more relevant local internship opportunities for students. Members of the Steering Group also regularly offer training seminars and forums, at which representatives from financial regulators as well as experts from the academia and industry are invited to share insights to deepen university students and industry's understanding of sustainable finance.

  The EPD has all along been supporting the continuous development of environmental professions in Hong Kong, so that the standards and credibility of environment-related services and industries can be enhanced through professionalisation. The EPD is exploring collaboration with the Hong Kong Institute of Qualified Environmental Professionals to provide ESG-related training, with a view to addressing the rapid development and growing demand for talents in the ESG field. Besides, relevant courses are offered by course providers under the Continuing Education Fund in response to market development and needs, which are currently mainly provided by higher education institutions, and the Employees Retraining Board also provides relevant courses."

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-23 14:03,2025-07-23 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300492.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 23) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

立法會四題：政府服務合約下受僱的非技術員工,2025-07-23 13:00,2025-07-23 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300421.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上謝偉銓議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的答覆：

問題：

有物業管理業界人士反映，政府服務合約下受僱的非技術員工中，不少屬清潔工及保安員的基層職位員工是按法定最低工資或略高於該水平的薪酬支薪，由於政府服務合約一般為期三年並屬「全包制」，在法定最低工資改為「一年一檢」後，政府服務承辦商或會因該工資在合約期內多次上調而出現虧蝕。此外，雖然補充勞工優化計劃現已容許輸入物管業勞工，但據悉相關政府服務合約卻不容許承辦商聘用外勞。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時有多少名政府服務合約下受僱的非技術員工，是按法定最低工資或高於該工資水平不足百分之十的薪酬支薪；

（二）會否考慮優化政府服務合約下受僱的非技術員工的支薪安排，改由政府承擔因法定最低工資上調而增加的額外薪酬開支，而無須由承辦商「包底」承擔有關政策風險；及

（三）會否考慮放寬政府服務合約不得聘用外勞的限制？

答覆：

主席：

就謝偉銓議員的提問，本局諮詢勞工及福利局和四個主要以服務合約形式僱用非技術員工的政府部門（即食物環境衞生署、康樂及文化事務署、政府產業署和房屋署）後，現回覆如下：

（一）政府近年已推行一系列優化措施，以保障外判非技術員工的薪酬待遇。四個主要部門經招標批出的服務合約共涉及43 000多名外判非技術員工，服務合約承辦商對相關員工的「承諾時薪」中位數約為55元，較現行法定最低工資水平（即42.1元）高約三成，同時亦較二○二四年政府統計處就「物業管理、保安及清潔服務」行業中涵蓋非技術工人及服務人員組別的市場中位數（即51元）高約百分之八。

在這43 000多名員工中，約百分之九十九的「承諾時薪」較法定最低工資水平高出至少百分之十（即至少46.3元）；餘下百分之一（約400名）員工的「承諾時薪」則高於法定最低工資水平平均約百分之七。由於「承諾時薪」是承辦商於投標時承諾向非技術員工支付的時薪下限，員工的實際時薪可能會高於此數，而合約期間服務承辦商亦可能因應市場情況上調員工薪酬。

（二）正如我剛才所述，由於四個主要部門約百分之九十九的外判非技術員工的時薪水平均較法定最低工資高出至少百分之十，因此除非法定最低工資水平在短時間內有十分顯著的升幅，否則政府服務承辦商純因法定最低工資上調而增加員工薪酬的可能性會很低。以今年五月生效的法定最低工資為例，由兩年前生效的每小時40元調升至每小時42.1元，升幅約為百分之五。

法定最低工資在「一年一檢」新機制下的調整會較以往頻繁，但由於新機制採用「方程式」調整，而調整的基礎是公開及客觀，企業因此可及早作出規劃，故服務承辦商在投標時應能就其提出的「承諾時薪」作出更有把握的估算。

政府一直要求服務承辦商與香港其他僱主一致，須向僱員提供符合香港法例和僱傭合約的薪酬待遇，包括提供不低於法定最低工資水平的時薪。服務承辦商在投標時會考慮與成本有關的因素，包括物料價格、租金、工資等，並適當地反映在投標價內。基於這些投標部署屬商業決定，政府沒有計劃補貼服務承辦商因為最低工資水平調整而增加的經營成本。

（三）在保障本地勞工優先就業的大前提下，政府適度容許僱主申請輸入勞工，補充本港勞動力。勞工處自二○二三年九月起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（「優化計劃」），容許「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位可輸入勞工，為期兩年。截至今年六月底，在「優化計劃」下申請輸入清潔員和保安員的人數共約23 000人，而獲批輸入的人數共約7 000人。根據政府統計處發布的《2024年收入及工時按年統計調查報告》，「物業管理、保安及清潔服務」行業中涵蓋非技術工人及服務人員的組別約有十九萬人，「優化計劃」下獲批輸入的清潔員和保安員數目佔上述人數少於百分之四。

政府外判服務合約就非技術員工的薪酬待遇安排與「優化計劃」的安排在多方面均有所不同。具體而言，政府服務承辦商必須以不低於合約訂明的「承諾工資」聘用非技術員工，而「優化計劃」則規定輸入勞工的薪酬不得低於本地工人擔任相類職位的每月中位工資。此外，政府外判服務合約就其他聘用條件（如合約酬金、在八號或以上颱風信號生效時工作的工資安排）均有規定。

我們會與勞工處保持聯繫，了解本地勞工市場中相關非技術勞工的供求情況（包括輸入勞工的情況），並在確認出現勞工短缺的情況及保障本地勞工優先就業的原則下，研究容許於政府外判服務合約輸入勞工的執行安排，包括處理承辦商在合約中需提供的「承諾工資」與輸入勞工的工資差異，以及協調不同制度的監察機制，以確保有效運用公帑並妥善監察服務承辦商。我們必須重申，政府任何輸入勞工的安排，必須在保障本地勞工優先就業的前提下執行。勞工處亦會嚴格把關，嚴謹處理每宗申請。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Non-skilled workers employed under government service contracts,2025-07-23 13:00,2025-07-23 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300422.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Tony Tse and a reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

Some members of the property management sector have relayed that quite a number of non-skilled workers employed under government service contracts, particularly those at junior levels such as cleaners and security guards, are paid the statutory minimum wage (SMW) or slightly more than that level. As government service contracts usually last for three years and are on an all-inclusive basis, the change in the SMW rate arrangement to annual reviews may result in government service contractors incurring losses due to repeated upward adjustments to the SMW rate during the contract period. Furthermore, while the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme now allows the importation of labour for the property management sector, it is learnt that the relevant government service contracts do not allow contractors to employ imported labour. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of non-skilled workers employed under government service contracts who are currently paid SMW or at a rate that is less than 10 per cent above SMW;

(2) whether it will consider enhancing the pay arrangements for non-skilled workers employed under government service contracts, so that the Government will bear the additional pay costs arising from the upward adjustments to SMW, instead of requiring contractors to ""underwrite"" relevant policy risks; and

(3) whether it will consider relaxing the restriction that prohibits the employment of labour under government service contracts?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the Labour and Welfare Bureau and the four major government departments which employ non-skilled workers under service contracts (i.e. the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Government Property Agency and the Housing Department), our reply to the question raised by the Hon Tony Tse is as follows:

(1) The Government has implemented a series of enhancement measures in recent years to protect the remuneration of outsourced non-skilled workers. The service contracts awarded by the four major departments through tendering involve more than 43 000 outsourced non-skilled workers. The median ""committed hourly wage"" offered by the service contractors to the relevant workers is about $55, which is about 30 per cent higher than the prevailing Statutory Minimum Wage (SMW) rate (i.e. $42.1) and about 8 per cent higher than the median market rate (i.e. $51) of the ""Estate management, security and cleaning services"" industry covering the group of elementary occupations and service workers in 2024 published by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

Among the some 43 000 workers, about 99 per cent are entitled to a ""committed hourly wage"" that is at least 10 per cent higher than the SMW rate (i.e. at least $46.3), and the remaining 1 per cent (about 400 workers) are entitled to a ""committed hourly wage"" that is about 7 per cent higher than the SMW rate on average. As the ""committed hourly wage"" is the minimum hourly wage that the contractors commit to pay to their non-skilled workers during the tendering process, the actual hourly wage of the workers may be higher than this rate, and the service contractors may increase their wage level during the contract period in light of market conditions.

(2) As mentioned just now, the hourly wage of about 99 per cent of outsourced non-skilled workers under the four major departments is at least 10 per cent higher than the SMW rate. Hence, unless there is a very significant increase in the SMW rate within a short period of time, it is unlikely that government service contractors would have to pay more to their workers solely because of an increase in the SMW. For example, the SMW increased by about 5 per cent from $40 per hour (which took effect two years ago) to $42.1 per hour (effective from May this year).

Under the new ""annual review"" mechanism, the SMW will be subject to more frequent adjustments than before. However, as the new mechanism adopts a ""formula"" for adjustment under an open and objective basis, enterprises can make early planning. Therefore, service contractors should be able to make more informed estimates when proposing the ""committed hourly wage"" in their tender submissions.

The Government has all along required service contractors to provide their employees with remuneration in compliance with the legislation in Hong Kong and employment contracts (including the provision of hourly wage not lower than the SMW rate), which is no different from other employers in Hong Kong. When submitting tenders, service contractors would take into account cost-related factors including material costs, rent, wages, etc., and reflect them in the tender prices as appropriate. As these bidding strategies are commercial decisions, the Government does not plan to subsidise the increased operating costs incurred by the service contractors due to adjustment of SMW rate.

(3) On the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government suitably allows employers to apply for importation of workers to replenish the labour force of Hong Kong. The Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 2023, which allows labour importation for 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts under the Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years. As at end of June this year, the number of cleaners and security guards applied for importation under the ESLS was about 23 000, and about 7 000 workers were approved for importation in total. According to C&SD's 2024 Annual Earnings and Hours Survey, there were about 190 000 workers in the ""Estate management, security and cleaning services"" industry covering the group of elementary occupations and service workers. The number of cleaners and security guards approved for importation under the ESLS accounted for less than 4 per cent of the above number.

The remuneration for non-skilled workers under government outsourced service contracts is different from that under the ESLS on various fronts. Specifically, government service contractors must pay non-skilled workers at a rate not lower than the ""committed wage"" as stipulated in the contracts, while the ESLS requires that imported workers be paid no less than the median monthly wages of local workers in comparable positions. Moreover, requirements on other employment terms are in place under government outsourced service contracts (such as the provision of gratuity and wage arrangement for working when the typhoon signal no. 8 or above is hoisted).

We will maintain communication with LD to keep abreast of the demand and supply of the relevant non-skilled workers in the local labour market (including the situation on labour importation), and explore implementation arrangements to allow importation of labour in government outsourced service contracts upon ascertaining the occurrence of labour shortages under the principle of ensuring employment priority for local workers. The arrangements include addressing the discrepancy between the ""committed wage"" to be provided by contractors under contract requirements and the wages for imported workers, as well as co-ordinating the monitoring mechanisms across different systems, so as to ensure effective use of public money and proper monitoring of service contractors. We have to reiterate that any arrangement by the Government on importation of labour must be implemented on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers. LD will also play a robust gate-keeping role and stringently process each application.

Thank you, President."
立法會二題：增加政府的地價收入,2025-07-23 12:57,2025-07-23 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300417.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上陳仲尼議員的提問和署理發展局局長林智文的答覆：

問題：

地價收入是政府的其中一個主要收入來源。然而，有意見指出目前私人住宅新盤庫存高企，發展商入標投地、申請補地價及進行舊樓重建的意欲低迷，令公共財政收入波動很大。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否考慮推出針對性措施以降低發展商項目發展的前期投資成本，例如優化賣地附加條款和拆細地皮出售等，並加強宣傳吸引更多本地及境外發展商投地，從而增加地價收入；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（二）會否重新推行勾地制度（即政府推售土地取決於有否發展商提出購買某幅土地），以平衡市場需求與政府主導權；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）除降低舊樓重建強制售賣的申請門檻外，政府會否考慮調整各區地積比率上限，透過提高舊樓重建土地的地積比率，吸引發展商參與舊樓重建；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府土地收入主要來自政府賣地、私人協約方式批地及契約修訂，市場出價會受經濟環境和房地產市場情況影響，有升有跌。政府的政策目標是維持持續及穩定的土地供應，促進香港社會和產業發展。政府會持續造地，並會審時度勢、有節有度地將用地推出市場。

就陳議員問題的各部分，謹回覆如下：

第一，不論外圍環境或物業市道如何，政府會盡力提升用地的吸引力。在制定年度賣地表和決定何時將土地推出市場時，政府一直密切留意市況，並聆聽潛在投資者和業界的意見。政府近年便因應市場情況推出一些規模較小、位處成熟社區、招標條款較為簡單的住宅用地。市場對此反應正面，上一個財政年度（二○二四至二五年）推出的四幅住宅用地均成功售出。

除個別出售的地塊外，我們亦關注如何紓緩發展商參與較大規模項目的開發資金壓力。政府在去年十二月就北部都會區（北都）三個「片區開發」試點進行市場意向徵集，當中邀請了業界就不同的財務安排表達意見，包括分期繳付投標金額，並按一定利率支付利息。我們會與銀行業界商討能否便利發展商為北都項目作出融資安排。同時，我們正探討容許土地業權人透過主動交回政府在北都計劃徵收的土地，以扣減或抵銷該業權人在新發展區進行原址換地或「片區開發」所需繳付的金額，增加發展商的發展意欲。我們亦正研究更廣泛應用「按實補價」概念，容許發展商按實際興建樓面面積及實際用途釐定補地價金額，減低企業的發展成本。

宣傳方面，我們於去年十一月舉辦了企業參與北都會發展活動，有超過80間企業代表出席並簽署支持及參與北都發展的意向書，同場亦有35間企業的代表簽署企業之間與北都發展有關的項目協議，總投資金額超過1 000億元，顯示出對北都發展的信心和興趣。

我們亦與其他政策局、引進重點企業辦公室（引進辦）及投資推廣署等合作，共同推廣北都，以及促進不同產業在北都發展。其中，引進辦負責引進全球具高潛力和代表性的重點創科企業，並先後公布四批共84間在香港設立或擴展業務的重點企業，當中有不少企業均對落戶北都表達興趣。投資推廣署則致力協助內地及海外企業來港開業及擴展，為其提供一站式的支援服務；去年幫助超過500家企業在港設立或擴張，包括對北都產業用地有興趣的公司。引進辦、投資推廣署及發展局轄下的北部都會區統籌辦事處三方會合作，跟進有興趣落戶北都的企業的需要。

第二部分，在現行制度下，政府每年預先公布賣地表，並會每季因應政策需要、市場環境及其他來源的供應等，公布季度推售的土地。我們認為目前的制度能讓政府掌握推售土地的主導權及節奏，確保政府得以穩定、審慎地增加土地供應。政府現時無意重推勾地制度，亦沒有打算賣地和勾地雙軌並行，以防打亂政府推地的策略和步伐，及為市場製造混亂信息。如果發展商對個別用地有興趣，可透過不同渠道向發展局反映，供局方參考。

作為政府鼓勵私營機構參與舊樓重建的一項措施，《2024年土地（為重新發展而強制售賣）（修訂）條例》（《強拍（修訂）條例》）已於去年十二月實施，降低了強拍申請門檻和利便相連地段的強拍申請。《強拍（修訂）條例》生效至今，土地審裁處已接獲四宗強拍申請。

政府近年亦推出其他措施，鼓勵私營機構參與舊樓重建，加快城巿更新的步伐。例如我們逐步落實於二○二一年完成的《油麻地及旺角地區研究》所提出的建議，包括同區試行地積比率轉移及容許住用和非住用地積比率互換，以提高重建項目的財務可行性。在市區重建局（市建局）已展開的深水埗和荃灣的地區研究中，我們會探討調整個別地區地積比率上限和提高個別舊樓地盤重建時的最高地積比率的可行性，市建局將在今年下半年提出更新大綱藍圖。此外，發展局正研究利用新開發土地推動大型舊區重建項目，包括考慮容許將舊區未用盡地積比率跨區轉移至新發展區，同時減低舊區密度。我們會在今年內完成相關研究並提出初步建議。"
​立法會三題：鄉村土地及小型屋宇政策,2025-07-23 12:53,2025-07-23 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300420.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上何君堯議員的提問和署理發展局局長林智文的答覆：

問題：

《基本法》第四十條訂明「新界」原居民的合法傳統權益受香港特別行政區的保護。根據終審法院於二○二一年的裁決，小型屋宇政策的所有環節屬於新界原居民合法傳統權益。然而，有意見認為現行的小型屋宇政策已實施超過50年，在執行和細則上已過時。關於鄉村土地及小型屋宇政策，政府可否告知本會：

（一）政府近期有否檢討新界原居民的小型屋宇政策；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於根據政府於去年十二月提交本會發展事務委員會的文件，政府已就整個北部都會區發展如何推動「城鄉共融」展開顧問研究，並會就落實城鄉共融制訂指引，相關工作的進展為何，以及有何具體措施推動鄉村參與發展，以釋放土地活力；及

（三）鑑於有社會人士提出「丁廈」概念，即集合鄉村眾新界原居民興建小型屋宇的權益（俗稱「丁權」）合建為現代化大樓，政府會否考慮該建議？

答覆：

主席：

新界小型屋宇政策由一九七二年起實施，讓年滿十八歲和父系源自一八九八年時為新界認可鄉村居民的男性原居村民，得以一生一次向當局申請批准，在其所屬鄉村內的合適土地建造一所小型屋宇自住。

就何議員提問的各個部分，我回覆如下︰

（一）終審法院於二○二一年就小型屋宇政策司法覆核案件作出裁決，確認小型屋宇政策的所有環節，即免費建屋牌照、私人協約及換地安排，均屬於《基本法》第40條內的新界原居民合法傳統權益。考慮到小型屋宇政策有其歷史背景，經已實施多年，而終審法院亦已確認其合法合憲，我們現時沒有計劃檢討有關政策。

不過，我們理解合資格的新界原居村民對興建小型屋宇的需求。在現有政策框架下，政府自二○二一年起透過精簡處理小型屋宇申請的程序以加快審批申請，包括同步處理不同範疇的流程、簡化處理反對意見的程序及採用會議形式與申請人面對面直接商討等。

上述措施已漸見成效。地政總署於二○二二年至二○二四年每年處理小型屋宇的申請宗數上升至平均超過2 500宗，超過署方服務承諾水平的2 300宗，而每年獲批准的宗數，亦由二○二二年的500多宗，增至二○二四年的800多宗，增幅超過五成半。

此外，為加快小型屋宇發展，地政總署於今年一月在元朗地政處以先導形式，推行自行核證計劃，讓地段業權人可以選擇自費委聘註冊專業人士，擬備並提交自行核證完成完工證規定事項的相關證明書，從而善用業界資源加快審批，亦為計劃下提交的申請精簡和加快審批流程，目標是在收到所有所需文件後10個星期內完成處理，署方已於今年七月把計劃的適用範圍擴展至北區地政處。

（二）北部都會區（北都）擁有不少歷史悠久的傳統鄉鎮和珍貴的自然生態，蘊含豐富的歷史和人文資源。「城鄉共融」是北都發展的重要內容之一，所以規劃新發展區時我們會保留傳統鄉村布局和面貌，並通過妥善規劃柔化城鄉界面，使新發展區與鄉郊融合調和。村民亦能受惠於新的交通和其他基建設施，以及新增多元的就業機會。為鄉村帶來新商機和便利訪客體驗鄉村文化，我們將在現行小型屋宇政策下探討更多拆牆鬆綁措施，鼓勵適量提供鄉村店鋪、食肆及民宿設施。我們亦會適當地保育和活化歷史建築和提供場地進行傳統活動，傳承文化。結合自然生態與歷史建築等旅遊資源，我們更可以推動無處不旅遊，豐富鄉郊生活體驗。

政府已委託顧問進行研究，就北都發展如何進一步推動「城鄉共融」制定政策和方向，過程中亦會諮詢包括村民在內的不同持份者。我們會適時向立法會匯報進度。

（三）小型屋宇政策的初衷是讓原居民在低密度的鄉郊環境聚居，容許「丁廈」或以高密度方式發展與此政策原意不符。此外，現行法例對發展小型屋宇有明確規定。按《建築物條例（新界適用）條例》（第121章），小型屋宇不得超過三層及不得高於8.23米（27呎），而上蓋面積不得超過65.03平方米（700平方呎）。在規劃層面方面，本來規劃作低層、低密度屋宇發展的土地，亦未必適合用作發展高層、高密度樓宇發展。

由此可見，不論是政策、法律或規劃層面，「丁廈」建議均大幅偏離或改動現行小型屋宇安排。另外，政府正全力以赴推進北都發展。北都關乎整體社會利益，全面發展會提供3 000公頃土地，以承載50萬個新住宅單位供不同背景和階層市民居住，亦會提供大量用地拓展產業，以及創造多元就業機會。發展北都是社會共識，亦是政府優次，而「丁廈」有其爭議性，在社會內引發討論會分散政府精力和資源，因此我們不認為現時應就「丁廈」予以考慮。

多謝主席。"

問題：

據報近日不少交通意外發生後，肇事司機選擇不顧而去或拒絕提供司機個人資料。有意見認為肇事司機採取該等行為的原因是相關交通違例事項的罰則較輕，能藉以規避危險駕駛引致他人傷亡等較嚴重的罪行，反映當局在打擊交通違例上存有法律漏洞。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年因涉及交通意外而（i）被捕、（ii）被起訴、（iii）經審訊後被定罪及認罪的人數分別為何，並按肇事司機所涉的違例事項列出分項數字（包括但不限於（a）不小心駕駛、（b）危險駕駛引致他人身體受嚴重傷害、（c）危險駕駛引致他人死亡、（d）交通意外後沒有停車、（e）交通意外後沒有報案，以及（f）交通意外後拒絕提供司機資料等）；

（二）鑑於根據《道路交通條例》（第374章）（《條例》），拒絕提供被懷疑曾犯《條例》所訂罪行的司機的個人資料的最高罰則為罰款一萬元及監禁六個月，而危險駕駛引致他人死亡的最高罰則為罰款五萬元及監禁十年，如屬首次被定罪，可被取消駕駛資格至少五年，如屬再次被定罪，則可被取消駕駛資格至少十年或終身，有意見認為兩項罪行的罰則差距極大，或間接鼓勵肇事司機拒絕提供個人資料以規避嚴重罪行，政府有否計劃提高拒絕提供司機個人資料的罰則和最高刑罰，以加強阻嚇性；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）據悉如涉事車輛的登記車主為有限公司，而相關人士在交通意外發生後拒絕提供司機個人資料，其罰則只限於罰款而無人須被監禁，政府有否計劃檢視有關車輛登記人在交通意外發生後的責任，例如會否要求涉事車輛的公司負責人（包括董事、總經理或公司秘書等）須就交通意外負責，以及會否研究賦權運輸署署長拒絕發出車輛牌照予多次干犯《條例》第63（1）條的公司車主；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（四）鑑於《刑事訴訟程序條例》（第221章）附表8列明罪行的罰款級數，但有意見認為該附表的上一次修訂是在一九九四年，考慮到現時的社會環境和經濟變化，未能充分反映一些罪行（包括違反交通法例的行為）的嚴重性，政府有否計劃檢討該附表和提高相應罰款金額；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）鑑於根據《裁判官條例》（第227章），裁判法院的最高刑罰一般為監禁兩年和罰款十萬元；而當法庭同時處理兩項或以上的可公訴罪行時，由裁判官判處的監禁刑期合計最高為三年，政府會否同步檢視該條例，研究擴大裁判官可判予監禁和罰款權力，以確保裁判官在審判較嚴重罪行（包括違反交通法例的行為）時可給予具阻嚇性的刑罰；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

警務處沒有備存「被起訴」、「經審訊定罪」或「認罪人數」等分項統計數字。

（二）及（三）根據《道路交通條例》（第374章）（《條例》）第63（1）、（2）及（3）條及和63B（2）及（3）條，如某車輛的司機被懷疑已觸犯《條例》所訂罪行，或某車輛在道路上引致有意外發生，警務人員可在有關指控罪行或意外發生當日後的六個月內，要求任何人提供涉事司機的個人詳情及（如有的話）他與該涉事司機的關係。《條例》第63B（5）和（7）條訂明，如任何人違反第63B（2）或（3）條即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處第三級罰款（即一萬元）及監禁六個月，除非該人士證明他不知道，及假使有作出合理努力，亦不會能夠確定涉事司機的個人詳情。

政府認同車主對其名下登記的車輛由何人駕駛應負有一定程度的責任，但登記車主實際上亦未必能完全掌握其車輛所有的運作資料。因此現時《條例》第63B條亦加入免責辯護條款，讓登記車主在某些情況下就其名下登記的車輛所引致的事故免除提供司機資料的責任，以作出適當平衡。

警務處一直嚴正和有效執法，致力把違例人士繩之於法，在調查交通意外時，除根據《條例》第63條要求登記車主提供可能涉及該交通意外的司機的資料外，也會根據案件性質，採用不同方式搜證，例如透過附近的防盜攝錄、行車記錄儀的錄像，甚至指紋等嘗試鎖定涉事司機。換言之，即使警務處未能從登記車主獲得可能涉及該交通意外的司機的資料，仍可透過其他辦法查找意外成因，對懷疑違法的人士提出檢控。

政府會繼續聽取持份者的意見，適時檢視法例。

（四）《刑事訴訟程序條例》（第221章）附表8訂有不同級數的罰款額，適用於不同條例罰款條文。各局和部門會不時因應其政策考慮，檢視和建議調整相應法例下的罰則，以確保罰則足以反映罪行的嚴重性。政府亦會適時就有關的罰款等級表作出檢視。

（五）裁判法院進行聆訊的控罪範圍包括簡易程序罪行和可公訴罪行，其中可公訴罪行的最高刑罰一般為監禁兩年和罰款十萬元。政府可因應相關政策，適當地在訂立或修訂個別法例時，賦權裁判官在該些法例下可判處的最高刑罰，以達致增加阻嚇力的效果，而不用對《裁判官條例》（第227章）進行相應修訂。現時，某些條例已賦權裁判官可就單一罪行最高判處監禁三年和罰款五百萬元。另外，雖然所有刑事案件的程序都在裁判法院開始，但較嚴重的可公訴罪行可移交區域法院或高等法院原訟法庭審理。區域法院的判刑上限為監禁七年，原訟法庭則可判處有關法例條文訂明的最高刑罰。這機制一直行之有效。

現時不同層級的法院（包括裁判法院）各有不同的司法管轄權，使法院之間的案件按性質、嚴重程度和複雜程度等因素，得以合理地分配，以確保司法工作的效能。任何對調整個別層級的法院（包括裁判法院）司法管轄權的建議，必須經審慎全面檢討，並廣泛諮詢持份者，方可作任何決定。主要考慮因素包括不同層級法院間司法管轄權的界定、如何確保各級法院具備適切司法人手及法律支援以應付相關案件，以及法庭整體的資源、設施和配套安排等。"
立法會二十一題：吸引人才與資本來港的計劃,2025-07-23 12:40,2025-07-23 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300295.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上葛珮帆議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

本港現行設有九項主要吸引人才與資本來港的計劃，包括「高端人才通行證計劃」（高才通計劃）、「一般就業政策」、「輸入內地人才計劃」、「優秀人才入境計劃」、「非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排」、「輸入中國籍香港永久性居民第二代計劃」、「新資本投資者入境計劃」、「科技人才入境計劃」及「職專畢業生留港計劃」（該等人才入境計劃）。此外，當局於去年六月一日起實施「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃），以提供入境便利予獲認可主辦機構邀請／保證來港參與有利香港特別行政區發展的指定短期活動。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）去年六月至上月，當局接獲該等人才入境計劃的申請及獲批宗數，以及涉及的收入分別為何；

（二）自高才通計劃推行至今，每年獲批來港的申請人的所屬地區或國家的分布為何；

（三）過去三年，每年透過該等人才入境計劃獲批來港的申請人中，從事創新科技範疇的人數分別為何，並按該等人才入境計劃列出分項數字；

（四）過去五年，每年透過一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃獲批來港從事短期工作的人數，以及其行業／界別的分布分別為何；除該兩項計劃外，政府會否研究推出其他措施或計劃，讓非香港居民可申請來港從事短期工作（即逗留期限不超過180日）；

（五）自短期訪客計劃推行以來，獲批來港的申請人數、所屬地區或國家的分布，以及其指定界別的分布分別為何；

（六）當局有否計劃擴大短期訪客計劃中「認可主辦機構」及／或「指定界別」的清單；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（七）據悉美國政府近年推出一系列新政策，包括收緊簽證制度及大幅縮減研究經費等，導致大量當地科研人員（尤其是華人科學家）考慮離開美國，政府有何措施（包括會否推出具針對性的人才入境計劃或措施）支援本地大學盡力吸引該等海外頂尖科學家來港發展？

答覆：

主席：

政府正推行多項吸引人才與資本投資者的入境計劃，積極吸納專業人才、企業家及高資產人士，豐富本地人才庫及吸引更多新資金落戶香港，提升香港的整體競爭力，促進本地經濟多元化及創新發展。

就議員的提問，經諮詢保安局、教育局、創新科技及工業局、財經事務及庫務局及入境事務處（入境處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）自去年六月一日，截至今年六月底，「高端人才通行證計劃」（高才通計劃）、「一般就業政策」、「輸入內地人才計劃」、「優秀人才入境計劃」（優才計劃）、「非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排」、「輸入中國籍香港永久性居民第二代計劃」以及「科技人才入境計劃」共接獲逾19萬宗申請，當中近14萬宗獲批。有關分項統計數字載於附件一。「職專畢業生留港計劃」要待首批合資格全日制高級文憑課程學生於二○二六年年中起畢業後才開始接受申請。

在「新資本投資者入境計劃」下，投資推廣署負責審查申請是否符合有關財務規定，入境處則負責審批簽證‍／進入許可、延長逗留期限和無條件限制逗留的申請。去年六月一日至今年六月底，入境處共接獲1295宗「新資本投資者入境計劃」的申請，當中673宗獲批。入境處沒有備存提問涉及各項計劃申請及簽證費用所得收入的統計數字。

（二）以吸納高收入人士或頂尖學府學士畢業生為目標的高才通計劃自二○二二年底推出以來反應十分踴躍。截至今年六月底，共收到約135000宗申請，當中近109000宗獲批，有約四成（約32000名）B類及C類的申請者畢業於海外頂尖大學的學士課程。高才通計劃的獲批個案按申請人及其合資格大學所屬地區的分項統計數字載於附件二。

（三）過去三年，「一般就業政策」及「輸入內地人才計劃」下分別約76000及57000宗獲批申請中，從事創新科技（創科）相關範疇工作的獲批申請人數目分別為1654及4006。優才計劃下，過去三年成功通過甄選程序的獲批個案約有27000宗，當中8021名申請人背景來自創科相關範疇。至於旨在吸納科技人才來港從事研發工作的「科技人才入境計劃」，過去三年共有334位申請人獲批，全數從事創科範疇工作。

就高才通計劃，入境處於二○二三年三月一日調整申請流程，要求有工作經驗的申請人必須申報其職業所屬的界別。自二○二三年三月起至今年六月底，近十萬宗獲批申請當中有26211名申請人申報其過去工作屬創科相關範疇。

提問中的其他人才入境計劃下，申請人申請來港時無須已在港覓得工作，在首個簽證有效期間，申請人如在港受聘或開辦／參與業務，亦無須通知入境處。鑑於計劃的性質，「新資本投資者入境計劃」並不要求申請人申報其職業背景。入境處沒有備存其他計劃獲批申請人剛來港時從事行業的統計資料。

（四）過去五年，「一般就業政策」接獲逾112000宗申請，逾103000宗申請獲批，當中約63000宗為聘用期少於12個月的短期職位。「輸入內地人才計劃」過去五年共收到近88000宗申請，超過77000宗獲批，約31000宗獲批申請為短期職位的個案。兩個計劃下獲批擔任短期職位的個案按行業／界別的分項統計數字載於附件三。

企業若有職位空缺並面對本地招聘困難，便可經由上述兩項就業掛鈎入境計劃提出申請，聘用具備香港所需而又缺乏的特別技能、知識或經驗的外來人才來港從事短期或長期工作。

為方便營商和促進相關界別發展，並提升香港的國際形象，政府亦已於二○二二年六月推出為期兩年的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利先導計劃」（先導計劃），並於二○二四年六月把先導計劃恆常化為「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）。在先導計劃／短期訪客計劃下，獲政府相關決策局／部門認可的機構可向界別內相關的非本地人才發出邀請信，獲邀人士可以訪客身分來港參與指定短期活動，而無須向入境處申請工作簽證／進入許可。他們每次來港可在不超過連續14個曆日期間參與指定短期活動，並可就該指定活動收取報酬。

上述計劃已能滿足本地企業聘請外來人才來港從事短期工作的需要。目前無意再推出供非香港居民申請來港短期工作的新措施或計劃。

（五）及（六）短期訪客計劃目前涵蓋十二個界別，涉及共400多個認可機構。截至二○二五年三月底，先導計劃／短期訪客計劃已合共惠及近34000名非本地人才，便利他們以訪客身分來港參與各項短期盛事及活動。按界別及受惠人士來源地的統計數字載於附件四。

保安局表示，為確保計劃與時並進，政府不時審視先導計劃／短期訪客計劃的涵蓋範圍，務求使計劃能夠持續有效地達致相關政策目標。自先導計劃推出以來，政府分別兩次在二○二三年二月以及二○二四年六月擴大計劃，在原有十個指定界別外，增加「金融」及「發展與建築」兩個新界別，並新增認可機構至現時400多個。政府會繼續留意短期訪客計劃的實施情況和相關部門及業界的意見，適時檢討計劃的涵蓋範圍。

（七）因應目前全球教育格局變化，教育局已即時呼籲全港所有大學，為受影響的學生學者提供便利措施，維護他們的正當合法權益。至於受影響的科研人員，教育局一直鼓勵各院校按多元人才政策，吸引頂尖人才。教育局樂見本港各大學均積極回應及密切留意情況，充分善用政府支持本地專上院校擴容提質的便利措施。政府會繼續留意事態發展，並按他們的需要通盤考慮支援方案，包括逐步增加香港博士研究生獎學金計劃名額，吸引更多傑出學者來港，發揮香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的角色。

同時，政府致力推動香港發展成為國際創科中心，一直多管齊下吸引世界各地的創科人才來港，並提供更多優質就業職位和發展機遇。舉例而言，「InnoHK創新香港研發平台」（InnoHK研發平台）已匯聚本地和全球各地約2 500名科研人員。政府已開展建設第三個InnoHK研發平台「SEAM@InnoHK」，聚焦可持續發展、能源、先進製造及材料，相信可匯聚更多人才。

此外，政府於二○二五年五月獲立法會撥款30億元設立「前沿科技研究支援計劃」，旨在支持由大學教育資助委員會資助的八所大學以配對資助形式，吸引國際頂尖科研人員在港進行前沿科技研究及提升科研基礎設施。是項計劃預計在二○二五年九月推出。政府亦已預留60億元，資助本地大學在香港設立生命健康研發院，促進本地與海內外跨大學／科研機構和跨學科的合作，並吸引頂尖學者和科學家來港。

現時，國際頂尖學者、科學家和科研人員可按其情況透過合適的人才入境計劃申請來港，無需再另設人才入境計劃。如符合「人才清單」上的相關專業資格，他們亦可在透過相關計劃申請來港時獲得入境便利。眾多計劃中，「科技人才入境計劃」尤以輸入非本地科技人才到港從事研發工作為目標，合資格公司的人才入境申請可獲快速處理。"
LCQ21: Schemes for attracting talents and capital to Hong Kong,2025-07-23 12:40,2025-07-23 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300298.htm," Following is a question by the Hon ElizabethQuatand a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

 At present, there are nine schemes mainly for attracting talents and capital to Hong Kong, including the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS), the General Employment Policy (GEP), the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP), the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates, the Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents, the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, the Technology Talent Admission Scheme and the Vocational Professionals Admission Scheme (such talent admission schemes). In addition, the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (the STV Scheme) was introduced on June 1 last year to provide immigration facilitation to visitors invited/sponsored by authorised host organisations for undertaking specified short-term activities which are beneficial to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of applications received and approved by the authorities under such talent admission schemes from June to last month, as well as the respective incomes involved;

(2) of the distribution of the regions or countries of applicants admitted to Hong Kong each year since the implementation of the TTPS;

(3) among applicants admitted to Hong Kong through such talent admission schemes in each of the past three years, of the respective numbers of those who were engaged in the area of innovation and technology, with a breakdown by such talent admission schemes;

(4) of the respective numbers of persons who were approved to take up short-term employment in Hong Kong through the GEP and the ASMTP in each of the past five years, as well as the respective distribution of their industries/sectors; apart from these two schemes, whether the Government will explore the introduction of other measures or schemes to enable non-Hong Kong residents to apply for short-term employment in Hong Kong (i.e. the limit of stay is not more than 180 days);

(5) of the respective numbers of applicants admitted to Hong Kong since the implementation of the STV Scheme, the distribution of their regions or countries and their designated sectors;

(6) whether the authorities have plans to expand the list of authorised host organisations and/or designated sectors under the STV Scheme; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(7) as it is learnt that the introduction of a series of new policies by the United States (US) Government in recent years, including tightening the visa regime and substantially reducing research funding, has led to a large number of local scientific researchers (especially Chinese scientists) considering leaving the US, of the Government's measures (including whether it will introduce targeted talent admission schemes or measures) to support local universities in striving to attract such top-notch overseas scientists to Hong Kong for development?

Reply:

President,

  The Government has been implementing various admission schemes to attract talents and capital investors, actively trawling for professionals, entrepreneurs and individuals with substantial assets. This is to enrich the local talent pool and bring in more new capital to Hong Kong, so as to enhance Hong Kong's overall competitiveness, and promote the diversified and innovative development of the local economy.

  Our reply to the Member's question, in consultation with the Security Bureau (SB), the Education Bureau (EDB), the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, and the Immigration Department (ImmD), is as follows:

(1) Since June 1 last year and up to end-June this year, more than 190 000 applications were received under the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS), the General Employment Policy (GEP), the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP), the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS), the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates, the Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents, and the Technology Talent Admission Scheme (TechTAS). Among them, nearly 140 000 applications were approved. A breakdown of the relevant statistics is at Annex 1. The Vocational Professionals Admission Scheme will only begin to accept applications from mid-2026 onwards upon graduation of the first batch of students from eligible full-time Higher Diploma programmes.

  Under the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (New CIES), Invest Hong Kong is responsible for assessing whether the applications fulfil the relevant financial requirements, and the ImmD is responsible for assessing the applications for visa/entry permit, extension of stay and unconditional stay. From June 1 last year to end-June this year, the ImmD received a total of 1 295 applications under the New CIES, of which 673 were approved. The ImmD does not maintain the statistics on the income generated from applications and visa fees under various schemes mentioned in the question.

(2) The TTPS, which aims to attract individuals with high-income or bachelor's degree graduates from top universities, has received enthusiastic responses since its launch in end-2022. As at end-June this year, about 135 000 applications were received, of which nearly 109 000 were approved. About 40 per cent (about 32 000) applicants in Categories B and C graduated from bachelor's degree programmes offered by top overseas universities. The breakdown of the numbers of the applications approved under the TTPS by regions of the applicants and the eligible universities from which they graduated is at Annex 2.

(3) In the past three years, among the around 76 000 and 57 000 applications approved under the GEP and the ASMTP respectively, the numbers of approved applicants working in innovation and technology (I&T) related fields are 1 654 and 4 006 respectively. Under the QMAS, among the around 27 000 approved cases which successfully passed the selection exercise in the past three years, 8 021 applicants were in I&T-related fields. As for the TechTAS, which aims to attract technology talents to come to undertake research and development work in Hong Kong, a total of 334 applicants were approved in the past three years, all working in the I&T field.

  Regarding the TTPS, the ImmD adjusted the application procedures on March 1, 2023, requiring applicants with work experience to declare the sectors of their occupations. From March 2023 to end-June this year, 26 211 applicants out of nearly 100 000 approved applications declared that their previous occupations were in I&T-related fields.

  For other talent admission schemes referred to in the question, applicants are not required to have secured offers of employment in Hong Kong upon application, nor are they required during the validity period of the first visas to notify the ImmD after they are employed or have established/joined in business in Hong Kong. Given the nature of the scheme, the New CIES does not require applicants to declare their occupational backgrounds. The ImmD does not maintain the statistics on the industries engaged by successful applicants under other schemes when they first arrived in Hong Kong.

(4) In the past five years, over 112 000 applications were received under the GEP with over 103 000 approved. Of which, about 63 000 concerned short-term positions with contract duration of less than 12 months. The ASMTP received nearly 88 000 applications in the past five years. Of which, more than 77 000 were approved, and about 31 000 applications concerned short-term positions. The breakdown of the numbers of cases approved for short-term positions under the two schemes by industry/sector are at Annex 3.

  Enterprises with job vacancies and facing difficulties to fill the vacancies in local recruitment may apply under the above two employment-tied schemes to employ outside talents with special skills, knowledge or experience not readily available in Hong Kong to take up short-term or long-term employment in Hong Kong.

  With a view to facilitating business, promoting the development of the relevant sectors and raising Hong Kong's international profile, the Government also launched the Pilot Scheme on Immigration Facilitation for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (Pilot Scheme) in June 2022, and regularised the Pilot Scheme to the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) in June 2024. Under the Pilot Scheme/STV Scheme, organisations authorised by the relevant government bureaux or departments can issue invitation letters to relevant non-local talents in their sectors. Invited persons may come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas or entry permits from the ImmD. They may participate in the specified short-term activities for up to 14 consecutive calendar days during each trip to Hong Kong, and receive remuneration for the specified activities concerned.

  The above schemes have already met the needs of local enterprises in recruiting outside talents to take up short-term employment in Hong Kong. There is no plan now to introduce more measures or schemes for non-local residents to apply for short-term positions in Hong Kong.

(5) and (6) At present, the STV Scheme covers 12 sectors with a total of some 400 authorised organisations. As of end-March 2025, the Pilot Scheme/STV Scheme had benefited a total of nearly 34 000 non-local talents, facilitating their entry into Hong Kong as visitors to participate in various short-term events and activities. The statistics by sector and the beneficiaries' place of origin are at Annex 4.

  The SB indicates that to ensure the scheme keeping pace with the times, the Government reviews the coverage of the Pilot Scheme/STV Scheme from time to time, with a view to ensuring that it can continue to effectively achieve the relevant policy objectives. Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the Government expanded the scheme twice in February 2023 and June 2024, by adding two new sectors, namely ""Finance"" and ""Development and Construction"", to the original 10 designated sectors, with the addition of authorised organisations to over 400 at present. The Government will continue to monitor the implementation of the STV Scheme and the views of relevant departments and the sectors, as well as to review the coverage of the STV Scheme in a timely manner.

(7) In the light of the changes in the global higher education landscape, the EDB has promptly called on all universities in Hong Kong to introduce facilitation measures for affected students and scholars with a view to safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests. As for the affected researchers, the EDB has all along been encouraging various institutions to attract top-notch talents in accordance with their diversified talent policies. The EDB is pleased to see that the local universities have been responding proactively and closely monitoring the situation, and have fully utilised the Government's facilitation initiatives that support the capacity expansion and quality enhancement of post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong. The Government will continue to keep an eye on the development and, having regard to their needs, consider support measures in a holistic approach, including gradually increasing the number of places under the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme to attract more top scholars to Hong Kong, so as to give full play to Hong Kong's role as an international post-secondary education hub.

  Meanwhile, the Government is committed to promoting Hong Kong's development into an international I&T centre and has been adopting a multi-pronged approach in providing more quality employment and development opportunities to pool together global I&T talents. For instance, the InnoHK Research Clusters (InnoHK) have pooled together about 2 500 researchers locally and from all over the world. The Government is taking forward the establishment of the third InnoHK research cluster, SEAM@InnoHK, focusing on sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing and materials, which is expected to bring in more talents.

  Besides, the Government has secured funding approval from the Legislative Council in May 2025 for the establishment of the $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme (FTRSS), which is aimed at supporting, through matching funds, the eight universities funded by the University Grants Committee to attract international top-notch researchers for conducting research projects on frontier technology in Hong Kong and enhance basic research facilities. It is the plan to launch the FTRSS in September 2025. The Government has also set aside $6 billion to support local universities to set up Life and Health Technology Research Institute(s) to foster multi-disciplinary co-operation among universities/research institutions from Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, and attract top-notch scholars and scientists to Hong Kong.

  At present, top international scholars, scientists and researchers can apply for entry into Hong Kong under suitable talent admission schemes according to their own circumstances. There is no need to set up a separate talent admission scheme. If meeting the relevant professional qualifications in the Talent List, they can also enjoy immigration facilitation when applying for entry into Hong Kong under the relevant schemes. Among the various schemes, the TechTAS specifically targets the admission of non-local technology talents to Hong Kong for research and development work, and processes applications from eligible companies expeditiously."
LCQ19: Combating traffic offences,2025-07-23 12:40,2025-07-23 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300325.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Yung Hoi-yan and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

It has been reported that after the occurrence of traffic accidents recently, many drivers who caused the accidents chose to hit and run or refused to provide the drivers' personal particulars. There are views that the reason for the drivers who caused the accidents taking such actions is the lighter penalty for the relevant traffic offences, thereby enabling them to circumvent more serious offences such as causing casualties by dangerous driving, which reflected the existence of legal loopholes in the authorities' efforts to combat traffic offences. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of persons who were (i) arrested, (ii) prosecuted, (iii) convicted after trial and on own plea for being involved in traffic accidents in each of the past five years, together with a breakdown by the offenses involving the drivers concerned (including but not limited to (a) careless driving, (b) causing grievous bodily harm by dangerous driving, (c) causing death by dangerous driving, (d) failing to stop after a traffic accident, (e) failing to report after a traffic accident, and (f) refusing to provide the driver's information after a traffic accident);

(2) given that under the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374) (the Ordinance), the maximum penalty for refusal to give information on the driver of a vehicle suspected of having committed an offence under the Ordinance is liable to a fine of $10,000 and an imprisonment for six months, whereas the maximum penalty for dangerous driving causing death is a fine of $50,000 and an imprisonment for 10 years; disqualification from driving for not less than five years on first conviction and not less than 10 years or life on subsequent conviction, there are views that the disparity in the penalties between the two offences is significant, which may indirectly encourage drivers who caused accidents to circumvent serious offences by refusing to give personal particulars, whether the Government has plans to increase the penalties and maximum penalty for refusal to give a driver's personal particulars, so as to enhance the deterrent effect; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) it is learnt that if the registered owner of the vehicle concerned is a limited company and the relevant person refused to give the driver's personal particulars after the traffic accident, the penalty is only limited to a fine and no one has to be imprisoned, whether the Government has plans to review the responsibility of the registrant of the vehicle concerned after a traffic accident, e.g. whether it will hold the responsible individuals of companies of the vehicle involved (including director, general manager or company secretary) responsible for the traffic accident, and whether it will study empowering the Commissioner for Transport to refuse to issue licences to owners of company vehicles who have repeatedly committed offences under section 63(1) of the Ordinance; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) given that Schedule 8 to the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap. 221) sets out the level of fines for offences, but there are views that the Schedule was last revised in 1994 and has failed to adequately reflect the severity of some of the offences (including behaviour in contravention of traffic legislation) taking into account the current social environment and economic changes, whether the Government has plans to review the Schedule and increase the corresponding amounts of fines; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) given that under the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap. 227), the maximum sentence Magistrates' Courts can impose is generally two years' imprisonment and a fine of $100,000; and maximum three years' imprisonment where there are two or more indictable offences being dealt with by the courts at the same time, whether the Government will review the Ordinance and study expanding the Magistrates' power to impose imprisonment and fine in parallel, so as to ensure that they can impose deterrent penalties when more serious offences (including contravention of traffic legislation) are being adjudicated; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

President,

After consulting the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Department of Justice, and the Judiciary Administration, my consolidated reponse to the questions raised by the Hon Yung Hoi-yan on combating traffic offences is as follows:

(1) The numbers of arrests related to the offences mentioned in the question from 2020 to 2024 are listed in the table below. Apart from the initial figures, which may have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers have remained generally stable in recent years.

The HKPF does not maintain a breakdown of statistical data for ""prosecutions"", ""convictions through trial"", or ""guilty pleas"".

(2) and (3) In accordnance with sections 63(1), (2) and (3) and 63B(2) and (3) of the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374) (the Ordinance), if the driver of a vehicle is suspected of having committed an offence under the Ordinance, or an accident occurs owing to the presence of a vehicle on a road, a police officer may, within six months after the date of the alleged offence or accident, demand any person to provide the personal particulars of the driver involved and the relationship (if any) of the person to the driver concerned. Sections 63B(5) and (7) of the Ordinance provide that any person who contravenes section 63B(2) or (3) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine at level 3 (i.e. $10,000) and to imprisonment for six months, unless the person proves that he did not know, and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained, the personal particulars of the driver involved.

The Government agrees that a registered vehicle owner should have a certain degree of responsibility with regard to who drives the vehicle registered under his name. However, the registered owner may not actually have full control of all operational information of his vehicle. Therefore, the current section 63B of the Ordinance provides a defence provision to exempt registered vehicle owners from the responsibility of providing driver information in respect of the vehicle concerned under certain circumstances to strike a proper balance.

The HKPF has consistently enforced the law strictly and effectively, striving to bring offenders to justice. When investigating traffic accidents, apart from requiring the registered vehicle owner to provide information on the driver who may have been involved in the accident under section 63 of the Ordinance, the HKPF will, depending on the nature of the case, use various methods to gather evidence. These methods include analysing footage from nearby security cameras, dash cameras, or even fingerprints to identify the driver involved. In other words, even if the HKPF cannot obtain information of the driver who may have been involved in the accident from the registered owner, there are still ways for the HKPF to find out the cause of the accident through other means and to prosecute the suspected offender.

The Government will continue to pay heed to stakeholders' views and review the legislation when appropriate.

(4) Schedule 8 to the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap. 221) sets out different levels of fines applicable to penalty provisions under various ordinances. Bureaux and departments will from time to time review and propose adjustments to penalties under relevant legislation based on their policy considerations to ensure that the penalties reflect the severity of the offences. The Government will review the fine levels table as appropriate.

(5) The scope of charges heard in the Magistrates' Courts includes summary offences and indictable offences, with the maximum penalty for indictable offences generally being imprisonment for two years and a fine of $100,000. The Government may, in accordance with relevant policies, empower magistrates to impose maximum penalties under specific legislation when enacting or amending such laws to enhance deterrent effect, instead of amending the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap. 227). Currently, certain ordinances already authorise magistrates to impose a maximum penalty of up to three years' imprisonment and a fine of $5 million for a single offence. In addition, while all criminal proceedings commence in the Magistrates' Courts, more serious indictable offences may be transferred to the District Court or the Court of First Instance of the High Court for trial. The District Court has a sentencing limit of up to seven years' imprisonment, while the Court of First Instance may impose the maximum penalty prescribed by the relevant legislative provisions. This mechanism has been operating effectively.

Currently, different levels of courts (including the Magistrates' Courts) have distinct judicial jurisdictions, allowing cases to be reasonably allocated based on their nature, severity, and complexity to ensure the efficiency of judicial operations. Any proposals to adjust the judicial jurisdiction of individual court levels (including the Magistrates' Courts) should go through a comprehensive and prudent review and an extensive consultation with stakeholders, before any decisions are made. Key considerations include the demarcation of judicial jurisdiction among different court levels, ensuring that each level of courts has adequate judicial manpower and legal support to handle relevant cases, as well as the overall resources, facilities, and supporting arrangements of the courts."
​立法會七題：科技與生活科課程,2025-07-23 12:38,2025-07-23 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300289.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上梁子穎議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆︰

問題：

科技教育學習領域課程於二○一六至一七學年於初中級別全面實施，「科技與生活」是其中一個涵蓋的知識範圍。在初中階段，不少學校以科本學習模式，透過包括家政科等學科實施有關學習元素單元。而在高中階段，科技與生活科是選修科目之一，學生可選擇修讀關於「衣」（即「服裝、成衣與紡織」）或「食」（即「食品科學與科技」）的學習範疇，該等學習範疇可作為學生終身學習的基礎，為能力及性向不同的學生提供多種途徑，切合他們不同階段的需要，發展個人興趣。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（四）據悉部分學校不再開辦初中家政科或高中科技與生活科課程，政府有否了解有學校維持開辦和不再開辦該等課程的原因分別為何；當局有否其他教育資源或計劃，鼓勵學生深入學習食物或衣飾方面的知識，進一步鞏固其在初中時所掌握的共通能力，並助其建構新知識，從而培養他們終身學習的能力；如有，具體詳情為何，以及學校對該等教育資源或計劃的反應為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

科技教育是學校課程八個學習領域之一，當中包括六個必須涵蓋的知識範圍，而其中一個知識範圍為「科技與生活」。初中學生必須學習有關「科技與生活」知識範圍的學習元素；而高中學生可選修科技與生活科。

有關梁子穎議員的書面查詢，回答如下：

（一）及（二）在初中階段，所有學生必須修讀「科技與生活」知識範圍的學習內容，學校可就着學生需要，以不同方式推行課程。學校可透過獨立科目或以模組形式等涵蓋相關學習內容。根據學校提交資料，約有340間學校採用「家政科」或「科技與生活科」作為科名，以學科模式教授「科技與生活」知識範圍。亦有學校以模組形式落實「科技與生活」知識範圍的學習內容，透過落實相關內容推動及實施STEAM（科學、科技、工程、藝術和數學）教育，以突破學科的界限，擴闊學習的覆蓋面。為支援部分在初中未能全面提供「科技與生活」知識範圍學習內容的學校，教育局藝術與科技教育中心提供相關課程，讓學生參與，以切合學生需要。

高中方面，學生可選擇修讀「食品科學與科技」或「服裝、成衣與紡織」學習範疇。根據教育局二○二二／二三及二○二三／二四學年的「高中科目資料調查」，以及香港考試及評核局二○二三及二○二四年「香港中學文憑考試報考統計」（目前以上調查／統計尚未有二○二四／二五學年的數據），有關學校在推行科技與生活科的情況如下：

教育局沒有備存問題中有關每區學校初中修讀家政／科技與生活科，以及高中階段開辦科技與生活科的進一步分項數字。

（三）根據政府二○二四年九月的統計數字，全港約有440間公營及直接資助計劃的中學；而家政科／科技與生活科的教師人數約有430位，年齡介乎21至66歲，中位數為46歲。至於只任教初中／高中，以及同時任教初中和高中的教師數目，教育局未有備存。

（四）就落實科技教育「科技與生活」知識範圍，學校可因應其辦學宗旨及目標、教職員的專長、學生的背景及學習需要，於初中採用不同的課程推行模式，以及於高中決定是否開辦科技與生活科。

除高中科技與生活科，高中課程還包括約60個應用學習課程，當中不少與科技教育相關的，如時裝形象設計、甜品及咖啡店營運、西式食品製作、食品科技及營養，為學生提供更多元化的選擇。

教育局每年均為教授「科技與生活」知識範圍的教師提供專業培訓，包括研討會、工作坊及網上培訓；二○二四／二五學年共提供了17個相關的培訓項目，以增強教師規劃及實踐課程。同時，教育局通過專業社群活動，焦點小組討論，促進同儕交流，提升教師教學能量。教育局亦與專上院校和專業團體／機構合作，包括中華廚藝學院，為教師提供實踐和體驗的機會，以提升其創意及教學效能。

此外，相關的優質教育基金主題網絡計劃於本學年（二○二四／二五）啓動，為期三個學年，以「發展中學科技與生活科和家政科校本課程」為題，提升教師教授有關時裝設計元素的策略，協助學校發展具創新且切合學生需要的校本課程，以優化課程的推行及促進教師專業發展，並於本學年舉辦學生比賽及展覽，向公眾展示學生學習成果，反應良佳。

學與教資源方面，教育局持續更新「科技與生活」知識範圍相關的資源，如食品科學基礎、時裝設計基礎及形象塑造，為教師提供參考內容，以延展學生學習，提升學生進行探究的能力，並鞏固其共通能力。教育局每年亦出版「科技與生活科通訊」（www.edb.gov.hk/tc/tl/leaflets）及製作短片，為教師和學生提供相關的升學及就業資訊。

另一方面，教育局持續檢視「科技與生活」知識範圍的學習元素，如在課程中加強創新科技的應用及可持續發展學習元素；並透過與不同持份者協作，推展教師專業培訓，以切合學生學習需要。"

Question:

The Technology Education Key Learning Area Curriculum was fully implemented at the junior secondary level in the 2016-2017 school year, with ""Technology and Living"" as one of the covered knowledge contexts. At the junior secondary level, many schools adopt a subject-based learning approach, implementing relevant learning element modules through subjects such as Home Economics. At the senior secondary level, Technology and Living is one of the elective subjects, in which students may choose to study learning strands related to ""clothing"" (i.e. ""Fashion, Clothing and Textiles') or ""food"" (i.e. ""Food Science and Technology""). These strands serve as a foundation for students' lifelong learning by providing a range of pathways for students with varying abilities and aptitudes, meeting their needs at different developmental stages and supporting the development of personal interests. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information regarding secondary schools in each of the 18 districts across the territory that have offered the subject of Home Economics at the junior secondary level (i.e. Secondary One to Three) over the past three school years: (i) the name, (ii) the financing mode (i.e. government, Direct Subsidy Scheme, private or subsidised) and (iii) the type (i.e. boys' school, girls' school, or co-educational school) of the school, (iv) the number of students enrolled in the subject each year (set out by gender), (v) whether the subject of Technology and Living (Fashion, Clothing and Textiles strand) was offered at the senior secondary level, (vi) whether the subject of Technology and Living (Food Science and Technology strand) was offered at the senior secondary level, and (vii) whether the school is equipped with Home Economics room facilities (set out in Table 1);

(4) as it is learnt that some schools no longer offer the junior secondary Home Economics subject or the senior secondary Technology and Living curriculum, whether the Government has examined the reasons why some schools have continued to offer such subject or curriculum while other have discontinued them; whether the authorities have other educational resources or programmes in place to encourage students to delve deeper into knowledge related to food or clothing, further consolidate the generic skills they acquired at the junior secondary level, and assist them in constructing new knowledge, thereby nurturing their lifelong learning capabilities; if so, of the specific details, and how schools have responded to such educational resources or programmes; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Technology Education is one of the eight Key Learning Areas of our school curriculum. It covers six compulsory knowledge contexts, one of which is Technology and Living. Junior secondary students are required to study the learning elements relating to the knowledge context of Technology and Living, while senior secondary students may take Technology and Living as an elective subject.

The reply to the written question raised by the Hon Dennis Leung is as follows:

(1) and (2) While it is compulsory for all students to study the learning content of the knowledge context of Technology and Living at the junior secondary level, schools may implement the curriculum in different modes subject to the needs of their students. The relevant learning content may be presented in the form of a separate subject or covered in different modules, etc. According to the information submitted by schools, there are about 340 schools teaching the knowledge context of Technology and Living as a separate subject with ""Home Economics"" or ""Technology and Living"" as the subject name. Some schools adopt a modular approach to teach the learning content of the knowledge context of Technology and Living, promoting and implementing STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) education through the relevant content, breaking subject boundaries, and expanding learning coverage. To support some schools which are unable to provide all the learning content of the knowledge context of Technology and Living at the junior secondary level, the Arts and Technology Education Centre under the Education Bureau (EDB) offers relevant courses for students to cater for their needs.

At the senior secondary level, students can choose either the ""Food Science and Technology (FST)"" strand or the ""Fashion, Clothing and Textiles (FCT)"" strand. According to the Survey on Senior Secondary Subject Information conducted by the EDB in 2022/23 and 2023/24 school years, as well as the 2023 and 2024 Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) entry statistics compiled by the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (data of the 2024/25 school year for the above survey and statistics are not available for the time being), the implementation of the subject of Technology and Living in schools is as follows:

*Including Secondary Four to Six students

The EDB does not have further breakdown of the number of schools in each district offering Home Economics/Technology and Living at the junior secondary level and Technology and Living at the senior secondary level, as mentioned in the question.

(3) According to government statistics, as at September 2024, there are about 440public sector and Direct Subsidy Scheme secondary schools across the territory with around 430 Home Economics/Technology and Living teachers aged 21 to 66, with the median age of 46. Regarding the number of teachers who only teach in junior/senior secondary level, and those who teach in both junior and senior secondary levels, the EDB does not maintain such data.

(4) Regarding the implementation of the knowledge context of Technology and Living in Technology Education, schools may adopt different modes of implementing the curriculum at the junior secondary level and decide whether to offer Technology and Living at the senior secondary level, having regard to the school missions and objectives, the expertise of staff, as well as the background and learning needs of their students.

In addition to senior secondary Technology and Living, the senior secondary curriculum includes around 60 Applied Learning courses, many of which are related to Technology Education, such as Fashion Image Design, Pâtisserie and Café Operations, Western Cuisine, Food Technology and Nutrition, providing students with more diversified choices.

The EDB provides professional training including seminars, workshops and online training for teachers teaching the knowledge context of Technology and Living every year. A total of 17 relevant training programmes have been offered in the 2024/25 school year to strengthen teachers' capability in curriculum planning and implementation. Meanwhile, the EDB promotes peer exchange through professional community activities and focus group discussions, thereby enhancing teachers' teaching capacity. The EDB also co-operates with tertiary institutions and professional bodies/organisations, including the Chinese Culinary Institute, to provide teachers with the opportunity to practise and experience, with a view to boosting their creativity and enhancing their teaching effectiveness.

In addition, a relevant project with the theme of ""Developing School-based Secondary School Home Economics and Technology and Living Curriculum"" has been launched this school year (2024/25) under the Quality Education Fund Thematic Networks. With a duration of three school years, the project aims to enhance teachers' strategies in teaching the element of fashion design, and assist schools in developing an innovative school-based curriculum that caters for the needs of students, so as to optimise its implementation and facilitate professional development of teachers. Student competitions and exhibitions are also organised in the current school year to showcase the learning outcomes of students, and have received positive feedback from the public.

Regarding learning and teaching resources, the EDB continues to update the resources related to the knowledge context of Technology and Living, such as Basic Food Science, Fashion Design Basics and Image Building, to provide content for teachers' reference, with a view to extending students' learning, enhancing their exploration abilities and strengthening their generic skills. The EDB also publishes the ""Technology and Living Newsletter"" (www.edb.gov.hk/en/tl/leaflets) and produces video clips annually to provide teachers and students with relevant information on further studies and employment.

On the other hand, the EDB reviews on an ongoing basis the learning elements of the knowledge context of Technology and Living, such as strengthening the application of innovation and technology and the learning element of sustainable development in the curriculum. The EDB also promotes professional training for teachers through collaboration with different stakeholders in order to meet students' learning needs."
LCQ16: Conservation of geopark in Sai Kung,2025-07-23 12:25,2025-07-23 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300299.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

There are views that the geopark in Sai Kung (geopark), as part of Hong Kong's precious natural and geological heritage, has ecological conservation, scientific research and tourism education values. However, it has been reported that with the increase in the number of tourists recently, the pollution problem of the geopark has been worsening, posing challenges to the natural environment and the sustainable development of scenic areas. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current numbers and distribution of litter bins and waste separation facilities in the geopark, as well as the frequency of waste removal and conveyance at such facilities; in view of the waste disposal pressure arising from the surge in the number of tourists, whether the Government has specific plans to increase the number of temporary cleansing facilities, optimise the waste conveyance routes or introduce smart waste monitoring equipment to enhance the efficiency of disposal; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has launched publicity and educational measures on the conservation of the geopark (such as by placing publicity notices in the geopark and producing guidebooks); whether it will make use of multimedia to step up multilingual publicity and introduce interactive environmental education experience projects, and publicise ""Leave No Trace"" tourism through travel agencies and at the entrances of scenic areas; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) regarding littering in the geopark, of the relevant law enforcement manpower and frequency of inspections at present, as well as the number of relevant prosecutions instituted in the past three years; whether it will consider installing additional surveillance devices at the key areas where littering is often detected; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether the Government will establish an interdepartmental working group (comprising the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Environmental Protection Department, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, etc) to co-ordinate the geopark's waste management; whether it will promote tripartite co-operation among the Government, environmental groups and local villagers/business operators in handling refuse in the geopark, such as by encouraging business operators in neighbouring areas to take part in the cleaning work, recruiting community volunteers to go to the geopark for cleaning on a regular basis, or introducing an ""Environmental Contribution Award Scheme"" to attract the input of community resources; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) in the light of the ecological sensitivity of the geopark, whether the Government has plans to assess its visitor carrying capacity, and formulate measures such as booking of time slots or limiting visitor flows to strike a balance between visitor demand and environmental conservation; whether the Government will, in the long run, devise a Development Strategy for Hong Kong Geopark and incorporate waste management into its contents, while formulating systematic improvement proposals by combining ecological restoration, low-carbon tourism facilities (e.g. setting up distribution points for degradable rubbish bags) and the environmental impact assessment mechanism; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

President,

Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark (Hong Kong Geopark) consists of two geological regions, the Northeast New Territories Sedimentary Rock Region and Sai Kung Volcanic Rock Region. Most of the geopark attractions are located within country parks and special areas, and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) is responsible for the regular management work. In response to the question raised by Hon Stanley Li, a detailed reply is provided as follows:

(1) The AFCD has been committed to keeping the country parks clean and educating the public to cherish nature. Since 2015, through the ""take your litter home"" campaign, visitors have been encouraged to cultivate a sense of stewardship towards the natural environmental. To tie in with this initiative, litter bins and recycling bins along hiking trails have been removed since the end of 2017, while litter collection facilities are retained at recreational sites (e.g. barbecue sites and campsites) for use by visitors if needed. The AFCD collects litter from recreational sites, hiking trails and public toilets. The litter is then either transported to landfills or handed over to recycling service contractors for processing. The AFCD would flexibly adjust the arrangement for and frequency of litter collection and handling according to actual needs at different locations in country parks, as well as the usage and hygiene conditions of popular sites. In particular, during long holidays and weekends, the AFCD would strengthen relevant cleaning work. In response to the recent upsurge of visitors at some popular Hong Kong Geopark attractions, the AFCD has enhanced cleaning and management efforts, and the environmental conditions at these sites remain generally good.

(2) In regard to the issue of countryside litter, it is crucial to promote the message of reducing waste at source and caring for nature to the public. The AFCD has organised a variety of education activities, such as roving exhibitions, nature interpretation services, etc, to raise public awareness on responsible hiking practices. These messages have also been disseminated through multimedia, such as online videos (website: www.youtube.com/@HongKongCountryParks) and social media channels (Hong Kong Country Parks Facebook: www.facebook.com/hongkongcountryparks), in a lively manner to continuously raise the public's awareness. Posters, promotion banners and signages have been displayed at suitable locations in Hong Kong Geopark and at the entrances and exits of hiking trails to remind visitors to take their litter away and observe hiking etiquette. In collaboration with the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, seminars and field trips have been organised for tourist guides to enhance their understanding of Hong Kong Geopark attractions, and the message of ""take your litter home"". The AFCD has also co-operated with the Economic and Trade Offices in the Mainland and the Forestry Administration of Guangdong Province to publicise relevant messages through social media channels in the Mainland, and will continue to promote the relevant messages of ""leave no trace"" through various channels and initiatives.

(3) According to the Country Parks and Special Areas Regulations (Cap. 208A), anyone who litters in country parks or special areas commits an offence and is liable to prosecution. Upon conviction, the offender may be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned for three months. In addition, under the Fixed Penalty (Public Cleanliness and Obstruction) Ordinance (Cap. 570), any person who violates the above offence may be subject to a fixed fine of $3,000. Currently, about 150 AFCD staff conduct regular patrols and law enforcement actions in country parks and special areas over the territory. Patrols and law enforcement are part of the regular management work of country parks, and there is no detailed breakdown of the manpower and the number of patrols conducted at each country park and special area for combatting littering offences. The number of patrols conducted, prosecution instituted and fixed penalty notice issued for littering by the AFCD in country parks and special areas across the territory over the past three years are tabulated as follows:




Year
Number of patrol
Number of prosecution (within Hong Kong Geopark)
Number of fixed penalty notice (within Hong Kong Geopark)


2022
13 024

2023
13 891
0 (0)
8 (0)


2024
14 266

7 (1)




In light of the recent upsurge of visitors at Hong Kong Geopark Sai Kung High Island Reservoir East Dam, the AFCD has been enhancing efforts in reminding visitors to keep countryside clean by displaying banners at suitable locations, including entrances and exits of hiking trails, and using local and Mainland social media platforms (e.g. Xiaohongshu), as well as taking law enforcement actions against littering and other offences within country parks. The AFCD will continue to review and adjust the patrolling arrangements in country parks from time to time in the light of actual circumstances, and arrange special operations or utilise technology such as smart surveillance when necessary to strengthen law enforcement work against illegal activities within country parks.

(4) Most Hong Kong Geopark attractions are located within the country parks, and the cleaning work is conducted by the AFCD. When litter is identified in public areas outside the country parks, it will be referred to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) for cleanup. The AFCD has been working closely with various stakeholders to conserve the geological heritage and natural environment of Hong Kong Geopark. This includes assisting villages around the attractions of the park to follow up on environmental hygiene issues. To raise awareness among the youth about protecting the natural environment, the AFCD has invited students to collect litter during field trips to Hong Kong Geopark. In addition, the AFCD has encouraged and co-ordinated volunteer cleanup activities in Hong Kong Geopark. Since last year, over 20 such activities have been organised.

(5) Important geological and ecological sites of Hong Kong Geopark are protected under legislation including the Country Parks Ordinance and the Marine Parks Ordinance. The main objectives of Hong Kong Geopark are nature conservation, education and sustainable development. When planning and establishing Hong Kong Geopark in the early years, the Government formulated guiding principles to avoid the construction of facilities that would adversely affect the environment. The planning of suitable facilities depends on the actual conditions of different attractions, including their capacity to accommodate higher number of visitors and their ecological sensitivity. For example, sites with higher visitor carrying capacity such as the High Island Reservoir East Dam and Sharp Island, visitor facilities to facilitate visit and education purposes are provided therein; for areas that require preservation in their natural state, such as the coastline along Fa Shan of High Island, the Ung Kong Group and the Ninepin Group, visitor facilities like public piers or trails are avoided, and visitors are encouraged to enjoy sightseeing there by boat tours instead.

In response to the recent surge in visitor numbers at popular attractions within Hong Kong Geopark, the AFCD is reviewing the carrying capacity of these popular sites and will develop management strategies, such as co-ordinated traffic control measures with relevant authorities, and enhanced visitor management measures when necessary to prevent overcrowding. During peak hiking seasons, the AFCD will also increase the frequency of patrols, enhance cleaning and management efforts, and strengthen the promotion of hiking etiquette to ensure visitor safety and protection of nature, thereby achieving the co-existence of ecotourism and nature conservation."

答覆：

主席：

香港聯合國教科文組織世界地質公園（香港地質公園），由新界東北沉積岩園區及西貢火山岩園區兩個地質區域組成，大部分景點位於郊野公園及特別地區範圍內，由漁農自然護理署（漁護署）負責日常管理工作。就李世榮議員的提問，現詳細回覆如下：

（一）漁護署一直致力保持郊野公園清潔，並教育公眾愛護郊野，包括於二○一五年起推廣「自己垃圾自己帶走」，從而建立公眾對自然環境負責任的態度。為配合這項措施，自二○一七年底起，漁護署已移除所有郊野公園山徑上（包括香港地質公園）的垃圾箱及回收箱，只保留康樂場地（例如燒烤及露營地點）的廢物收集設施，供公眾在有需要時使用。漁護署日常主要在轄下的康樂場地、遠足山徑以及洗手間等收集垃圾，然後運往堆填區或交予回收服務承辦商處理。各地點清潔、收集及運送垃圾的安排按實際需要而定，亦會視乎訪客量及衞生狀況等適時調整，特別在長假期及周末，會於熱門郊遊地點加強相關清潔工作。因應近期香港地質公園內一些受歡迎景點遊人增加，漁護署已加強清潔及管理工作，當地的環境狀況大致良好。

（二）針對郊野垃圾的問題，宣傳源頭減廢和愛護自然的訊息至關重要。漁護署推出一連串公眾教育活動，例如透過巡迴展覽、導賞服務，向公眾宣傳負責任的遠足郊遊行為，以及透過多種媒體，例如網上短片（網頁﹕www.youtube.com/@HongKongCountryParks）及社交媒體（香港郊野公園Facebook﹕www.facebook.com/hongkongcountryparks），用生動的方式持續提升市民相關意識。漁護署亦於香港地質公園內合適位置及行山徑出入口張貼海報、宣傳橫額及提示牌，提醒市民帶走垃圾及遵守郊遊禮儀。此外，漁護署和香港旅遊業議會合作，為導遊舉辦講座及實地考察，除了介紹香港地質公園的景點，亦宣傳「自己垃圾自己帶走」的訊息；亦透過與駐內地的經濟貿易辦事處和廣東省林業局等合作，於内地社交媒體宣傳相關訊息。漁護署會繼續透過不同渠道和方法，推廣山野無痕的相關訊息。

（三）根據《郊野公園及特別地區規例》（第208A章），任何人在郊野公園或特別地區亂拋垃圾，即屬違法，可被檢控，違例者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款10,000元及監禁三個月。另外，根據《定額罰款（公眾地方潔淨及阻礙）條例》（第570章），違反上述罪行的人士亦可被定額罰款3,000元。現時漁護署共有約150名人員在全港郊野公園及特別地區進行日常巡邏及執法等工作。巡邏及執法為管理郊野公園日常工作的一部分，漁護署並沒有就每個郊野公園及特別地區負責打擊亂拋垃圾行為的人手及巡邏次數分別作出統計。過去三年，漁護署在全港郊野公園及特別地區的巡邏次數，以及就亂拋垃圾的行為提出檢控及發出定額罰款通知書的個案宗數表列如下︰




年份
巡邏次數
檢控個案（涉及香港地質公園範圍內 ）

因應近期有較多遊人前往香港地質公園西貢萬宜水庫東壩一帶郊遊，漁護署已透過於現場合適位置及行山徑出入口展示宣傳橫額、於本地及内地社交媒體（如小紅書）加強呼籲遊人保持郊野清潔，以及採取適當執法行動以打擊亂拋垃圾等違例行為。漁護署會繼續按實際情況調整巡邏安排，並在有需要時安排特別行動或應用智能監控等科技，以加強針對郊野公園違例行為的執法工作。

（四）大部分地質公園景點位於郊野公園內，由漁護署負責清潔工作；如在位於郊野公園外的公眾地方發現垃圾，會轉介食物環境衞生署安排清理。漁護署與各持份者緊密合作，致力保育香港地質公園範圍內的地質遺跡與生態環境，包括協助園內景點附近村落跟進環境衞生工作。漁護署亦舉辦活動，邀請學生到香港地質公園進行戶外考察，並沿路收集垃圾，提升青年對愛護自然環境的意識。此外，漁護署亦有鼓勵及協調義工到香港地質公園進行潔淨行動。去年至今上述兩類活動已舉辦超過20多次。

（五）香港地質公園重要的地質和生態地點已受到《郊野公園條例》和《海岸公園條例》等法例保護。地質公園以自然保育、教育和可持續發展為主要目的。政府早年在規劃及設立香港地質公園時，已訂定原則，避免增設任何不利於園內環境的設施，並按園內不同景點的實際情況，包括地方是否可容納較高遊客量、生態環境的敏感性等，規劃適切的配套設施。例如，政府在遊客承載量較高的地方，如萬宜水庫東壩、橋咀洲等，設有訪客設施，以便遊覽和作教育用途；為保存自然景觀，政府在糧船灣花山海岸、甕缸群島和果洲群島等地點，沒有設置配套設施，改為推廣以海路漫遊。

因應近期香港地質公園部分熱門景點遊客量的增加，漁護署正檢視園內熱門郊遊地點的遊客承載量，並會採取適當的管理策略，例如按需要與相關部門協調交通管制措施，及在有必要時加強遊人管理等，確保景點不會過度擠擁；亦會於郊遊旺季加強巡查、清潔及管理、就郊遊禮儀進行更廣泛的宣傳教育等，從而加強保障遊客安全及保護生態，確保生態旅遊與自然環境保育並存。"
立法會十三題：交通燈倒數計時器,2025-07-23 12:15,2025-07-23 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300340.htm,"​以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上周浩鼎議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

運輸署於二○二三年在東涌達東路與美東街交界的燈控行人過路處裝設新款行人交通燈倒數器（新款倒數器）以進行測試，當綠色人像燈號亮起時會開始倒數，讓行人可以掌握整個綠色人像燈號的剩餘時間。根據該署委託大學所進行的初步調查數據，在上述行人過路處安裝新款倒數器後，有效減少行人在綠色人像燈閃動完結前仍未完成橫過馬路的情況。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述測試至今所得的數據是否足以支持當局在更多地點裝設新款倒數器；如是，計劃裝設該倒數器的地點名單為何；如否，落實推展該倒數器的考慮準則及門檻為何；

（二）除上述在東涌的試點外，政府曾在哪些燈控行人過路處進行其他行人倒數器測試；會否考慮在該等燈控行人過路處推展新款倒數器以加快收集數據；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於政府於去年七月十日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，行車交通燈倒數計時器的效益在世界各地未有一致定論，或會因駕駛者對倒數器的反應不一而增加路口前後車輛相撞的風險，當局會否考慮仿效新款倒數器的測試方式，於適合地點測試行車交通燈倒數計時器，以獲取有用數據；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就周浩鼎議員有關測試行人交通燈倒數器（行人倒數器）的提問，經諮詢運輸署，我現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）運輸署於二○二三年底在東涌達東路與美東街交界的行人過路處裝設新款行人倒數器作為試點。新款行人倒數器改為由綠色人像燈號亮起期間開始倒數，讓行人較易掌握綠色人像燈號的剩餘時間。運輸署委託一間本地大學研究新款裝置對行人過路行為的影響及成效，結果顯示行人在綠色人像燈閃動完結前完成橫過馬路的情況對比早前試驗的有輕微改善。

為進一步收集新款行人倒數器在不同路況下的成效數據，運輸署正安排擴展測試，並揀選16個過路處（位置見附件）以進行測試。這些過路處在行人流量、過路距離及行人地區習慣等方面均有所不同，預計擴展的測試會提供更全面的數據以評估新款倒數器在不同情景和行人習慣下的成效。此外，運輸署亦會安排在其中四個試點同時加入行人紅燈倒數的功能，以了解對行人等候過路行為的影響，協助制定下一步的方向。

運輸署正安排陸續在各測試地點安裝新款行人倒數器，並會收集及分析相關數據，預計二○二六年中會有初步結果。

（三）運輸署一直留意行車交通燈倒數器在世界各地的應用及效益，並檢視倒數器是否既能提升道路使用者的出行體驗，亦可以在香港的燈控路口安全運作。運輸署參考內地多個城市和海外的實際應用經驗，發現各地現時就行車交通燈倒數器的安全性未有一致定論，部分原因是駕駛人士對倒數顯示的反應不盡相同，例如部分駕駛者知悉綠燈快要完結時，會選擇減慢車速及準備停車，但亦有部分駕駛者會選擇加速以通過路口，因而增加路口前後車輛相撞的風險。

基於以上情況及保障道路安全的大前題，運輸署會繼續密切留意有關裝置在未來的技術發展及應用經驗，審慎考慮其在香港的適用性。"
LCQ13: Traffic light countdown device,2025-07-23 12:15,2025-07-23 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300341.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Holden Chow and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

The Transport Department (TD) installed a new type of pedestrian traffic light countdown device (the new countdown device) at the signalised junction of Tat Tung Road and Mei Tung Street in Tung Chung in 2023 for testing. The new countdown device starts counting down when the ""green man"" light is on, such that pedestrians can gauge the total time remained of the ""green man"" light. According to the preliminary data collected from the survey conducted by a local university commissioned by the TD, after installation of the new countdown device at the aforesaid pedestrian crossing, the situation where pedestrians were unable to finish crossing the road before the flashing ""green man"" light ends has greatly improved. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the data obtained so far from the aforesaid test is sufficient to support the authorities' installation of the new countdown devices at more locations; if so, of the list of locations at which the authorities plan to install such countdown devices; if not, the criteria considered by the authorities and the thresholds for taking forward the implementation of such countdown devices;

(2) apart from the aforesaid trial location in Tung Chung, of the signalised pedestrian crossings at which the Government has previously installed other pedestrian countdown devices for testing; whether it will consider implementing the new countdown devices at such signalised pedestrian crossings to expedite the collection of data; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as the Government indicated in its reply to a question from a Member of this Council on July 10 last year that there was no worldwide general consensus on the merits concerning the effectiveness of vehicular traffic light countdown device, and that motorists' responses to the time displayed on the countdown device might be very diverse, resulting in a higher risk of head-rear collision between vehicles, whether the authorities will consider following the testing method adopted for the new countdown device and installing the vehicular traffic light countdown devices at suitable locations for testing, so as to obtain useful data; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

After consulting the Transport Department (TD), my response to the questions raised by the Hon Holden Chow on pedestrian traffic light countdown device (pedestrian countdown device) is as follows:

(1) and (2) In late 2023, the TD installed a new type of pedestrian countdown device at the pedestrian crossing of Tat Tung Road and Mei Tung Street in Tung Chung for testing purposes. The device begins its countdown when the ""green man"" signal appears, helping pedestrians better assess the total green time remained. The TD collaborated with a local university to evaluate the device's impact and effectiveness on pedestrian behaviour. Results indicate a slight improvement in the number of pedestrians completing their crossings before the flashing ""green man"" signal ends, compared to previous trials.

To further collect data on the device's effectiveness under varying road conditions, the TD is arranging to expand the trial, selecting 16 additional crossings (locations listed in Annex) for testing that feature diverse pedestrian flows, crossing distances, and local pedestrian habits. This broader trial is expected to yield richer data for assessing the device's performance across multiple scenarios and behaviours. Additionally, four of the trial sites will be equipped with a red-light countdown feature to evaluate its impact on pedestrian waiting behaviour, which will inform the direction of the next phase.

The TD is progressively installing the new pedestrian countdown device at the selected trial sites and will collect and analyse the corresponding data. Preliminary results are anticipated by mid-2026.

(3) The TD has been monitoring the global application and effectiveness of vehicular traffic light countdown devices, evaluating their potential to improve the travelling experience for road users while ensuring safe operation at signalised junctions in Hong Kong. Drawing on the experiences of various cities in the Mainland and abroad, the TD found no prevailing consensus regarding the safety of such devices. A key reason is the varied driver responses - while some drivers may slow down and stop as the green signal nears its end, others may accelerate to pass through the junction, increasing the risk of head-rear vehicle collisions.

Given the circumstances above and the overriding priority of road safety, the TD will continue to closely monitor future technological developments and the practical applications of such devices. Their suitability for use in Hong Kong will be considered with prudence and care."

LCQ8: Combating illegal rental activities,2025-07-23 11:58,2025-07-23 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300288.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Shang Hailong and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

 It has been reported that the Police neutralised a rental fraud syndicate several months ago, involving at least 150 victims and approximately HK$13 million in losses. Through an apartment management company, the syndicate recruited local individuals as agents (""principal tenants"") with high commissions on websites or social media platforms, luring talent admitted to Hong Kong under talent admission schemes and students that were ""drifters in Hong Kong"" to prepay one year's rent before defrauding the victims of their rent using fake tenancy agreements. There are views that the incident highlights gaps in the current regulatory framework for the property rental market. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will consider improving the current regulatory framework for domestic tenancies in response to the aforementioned case in which ""principal tenants"" allegedly defrauded tenants through illegal means, so as to protect the rights and interests of landlords and tenants;

(2) whether it will require the Estate Agents Authority to strengthen random inspections of property rental advertisements on Mainland and local social media platforms to root out advertisements containing fraudulent or misleading content;

(3) whether the authorities will collaborate with the relevant Mainland authorities and Hong Kong's higher education institutions to develop ""guidelines on fraud prevention in the local rental market"", which will be distributed to relevant individuals after the Immigration Department issues visas under the Top Talent Pass Scheme and before students' arrival in Hong Kong;

(4) whether the Police will strengthen co-operation with social media platforms to promptly remove and follow up on residential property rental advertisements containing fraudulent content; and

(5) how the Police will strengthen efforts to combat activities where lawbreakers entice students to participate in rental scams using high commissions; whether penalties be increased to serve as a deterrent?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has noted recent illegal rental activities perpetrated by fraud syndicates targeting new arrivals in Hong Kong. Through the social media, criminals impersonating owners of residential units contact new arrivals searching for rental units. The criminals falsely claim that they can sublet the units to the new arrivals at a discounted price and lure them into paying rent. Unfamiliar with Hong Kong's tenancy system and ways of seeking help, the new arrivals are prone to fall victims to the fraudsters.

 The Government has paid close attention to these rental-related scams. In this connection, the Government combats these activities through a multi-pronged approach, including strengthening monitoring work to ensure compliance of property rental advertisements, conducting targeted law enforcement actions and stepping up publicity and education.

 In consultation with the Housing Bureau, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) The Government's policy on the private residential rental market is to maintain a stable environment and minimise unnecessary intervention, with a view to facilitating free operation and steady development of the market. The Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) provides a framework for legal tenancy matters. Part IV of Cap. 7 is applicable to general domestic tenancy, where landlords and tenants may draw up the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreements as mutually agreed, and execute the tenancy arrangements in accordance with the spirit of the contracts. The ""principal tenants"" mentioned in the question, who deceived the sub-tenants by illegal means, may have committed fraud-related offences, which are regulated under the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) and the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455). Furthermore, the Estate Agents Ordinance (Cap. 511) regulates companies and individuals engaged in the estate agency trade. Estate agents and salespersons must comply with Cap. 511 and its subsidiary legislation. They should also comply with the Code of Ethics and Practice Circulars issued by the Estate Agents Authority (EAA). Persons who fail to do so may be liable to disciplinary action. If a licensee is convicted of a criminal offence, the EAA may suspend or revoke the licence of such a person.

(2) The EAA has all along been conducting cyber patrols to closely monitor online advertisements on the sale and letting of properties in Hong Kong (including those posted on social media platforms in the Mainland and Hong Kong), and examine whether they comply with the provisions of the Estate Agents Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation, such as whether the advertisements contain any false or misleading information. The EAA has stepped up these efforts in recent years. A total of 862 random checks on online property advertisements were conducted in the first half of 2025, representing an increase of 21 per cent compared to the same period last year. In case of any suspected non-compliance, the EAA will conduct follow-up investigations. Cases involving criminal elements (such as suspected fraud) will be referred by the EAA to law enforcement agencies for follow-up actions.

(3) To raise the vigilance of new arrivals to Hong Kong against rental-related scams, the Police and the EAA work jointly with relevant Mainland authorities and local stakeholders (including tertiary institutions) to provide new arrivals with online and offline information on rental-related fraudulent activities both before and after their arrivals, so as to help them identify and guard against the scams.

Pre-arrival information

 To enable new arrivals to learn about Hong Kong's tenancy system and the fraudsters' common deception tactics as early as possible, the Police have disseminated anti-fraud promotional materials specifically tailored for new arrivals through social media platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Douyin. In addition, the Police have produced a video clip in collaboration with the National Immigration Administration, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and the Hong Kong Immigration Department (ImmD). Adopting a first-person perspective of the new arrivals, the video clip demonstrates the modus operandi of fraudsters, with a view to raising the awareness of the new arrivals. The National Immigration Administration will also arrange for the viewing of these videos by the prospective new arrivals during their visa application process. Meanwhile, these videos are disseminated across border control points, exit-entry service halls in the Mainland as well as social media platforms including Xiaohongshu and Douyin.

 To strengthen protection of students who newly arrive in Hong Kong, the Police, in collaboration with the National Anti-Fraud Center, have organised both online and offline sharing sessions specifically for Mainland students coming to Hong Kong for studies and their parents. Additionally, anti-fraud information, including details on rental-related scams and ways of seeking help, has been distributed to parents.

Post-arrival information

 To ensure that new arrivals stay vigilant after arriving in Hong Kong, the Police distribute anti-fraud booklets and leaflets to them through the six regional public service counters of the ImmD, the Labour and Welfare Bureau and major tertiary institutions across Hong Kong. These materials include methods to prevent rental scams.

 Additionally, to broaden the reach of the information, the Police collaborate with relevant industries, including the real estate sector, the banking sector and telecommunications service providers, to distribute anti-fraud promotional packages to new arrivals. These promotional materials are updated from time to time, so as to remind new arrivals to be aware of the latest scam tactics, including rental-related scams.

 Furthermore, the EAA is committed to educating consumers on the salient points pertaining to renting and purchasing properties. In view of the fraudulent cases relating to property purchase or rental encountered by new arrivals in recent years, in addition to the promotional measures jointly rolled out with the Police, the EAA has, since the beginning of 2025, been actively collaborating with the Hong Kong Talent Engage, Economic and Trade Offices in the Mainland, the Consumer Council, higher education institutions, non-governmental organisations supporting new arrivals and local media to provide new arrivals with information on renting and purchasing properties in Hong Kong. An online public seminar, which was broadcast live on local and Mainland social media platforms, was also organised to enhance new arrivals' knowledge on the procedures for renting and purchasing properties in Hong Kong as well as fraud prevention. The EAA has put up a number of online advertisements through the Mainland's media network, and has participated in a seminar organised by the Hong Kong Talent Engage, reminding consumers that they should appoint licensed estate agents to better protect their own interests. In this connection, the EAA website provides the Licence List (www.eaa.org.hk/en-us/Licence-list), through which the public can input the full name or licence number of an agent to ascertain whether the agent is holding a valid licence. Moreover, the EAA distributes booklets such as ""A Guide to Tenancy"" and ""Tenancy Guide for Non-local Students in Hong Kong"" to various collaborating units. The public may also download these publications from the EAA website (smart.eaa.org.hk/publications) for reference. In future, the EAA will continue with its proactive publicity and education efforts through various channels and means, including preparing the launch of a new educational website, with a view to enhancing publicity on the steps and points to note when renting and purchasing properties in Hong Kong, so as to raise the anti-fraud awareness amongst the general public and new arrivals.

(4) The Police have been maintaining close collaboration with social media platforms. Should suspected fraudulent (including rental-related) content be found, the Police will request the platforms concerned to immediately remove the content and take appropriate follow-up actions. During the period between January and May this year, the platforms concerned have reviewed and removed over 33 000 items of fraudulent content at the request of the Police.

(5) As mentioned in the introduction of our reply, the Government has been paying close attention to the above-mentioned rental-related scams and adopting a multi-pronged approach, which includes enhanced targeted enforcement actions, to combat these activities. For example, in February this year, the Police carried out the Operation Black Fire, during which a criminal syndicate manipulated by triads involving ""fake estate agents"" was smashed. A total of 14 persons, including a syndicate mastermind, a licensed estate agent and 12 syndicate members, have been arrested so far. The fraud syndicate was involved in over 270 cases, with crime proceeds amounting to approximately HK$30 million. While the Police are continuing with their investigation, one of the arrested persons has already been charged with one count of ""conspiracy to defraud"", and more of them may be charged.

 Lawbreakers enticing students to participate in rental scams using commissions may have committed fraud-related offences, including the offence of ""fraud"" under section 16A and the offence of ""obtaining property by deception"" under section 17 of the Theft Ordinance, and are liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years and 10 years respectively. In addition, under section 159C of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200), a person who has committed the offence of ""conspiracy to defraud"" is liable on conviction to imprisonment for up to 14 years, while a person charged with ""dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" under section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance for proceeds of deception is liable to maximum penalties of 14 years' imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million. Depending on the nature and gravity of the case, the Police may also apply to the court for invocation of section 27 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance to seek enhanced sentences and thus strengthen deterrence. Members of the public are urged not to commit the offence out of greed.

 In conclusion, the Government will continue to adopt a multi-pronged approach to stringently combat rental scams, and raise the new arrivals' vigilance against related scams through enhanced publicity and education."
​立法會八題：打擊不法租賃的行為,2025-07-23 11:58,2025-07-23 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300291.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上尚海龍議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據報警方在數月前瓦解一個租屋詐騙集團，涉及至少150名受害人及約1,300萬港元的損失；該集團透過一間公寓管理公司，在網站或社交平台以高佣金方式招攬本地人士為代理人（俗稱「二房東」），引誘人才入境計劃下來港的人才及「港漂」學生預繳一年租金，並以假租約騙取受害人的租金。有意見認為有關事件反映現行樓宇租貸市場監管存在漏洞。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否因應上述有關「二房東」涉嫌以不法手段詐騙租客的個案，考慮完善現行租賃住宅的規管架構，以保障業主與租客的權益；

（二）會否要求地產代理監管局加強抽查內地和本地社交平台上的樓宇出租廣告，以杜絕帶有詐騙和混淆成分的廣告；

（三）當局會否與內地相關部門及本港高等院校合作制訂「本地租屋防騙指南」，在入境事務處向相關人士批出高端人才通行證計劃簽證後及學生來港前，向他們派發該指南；

（四）警方會否加強與社交平台合作，即時下架和跟進涉及詐騙內容的住宅租賃廣告；及

（五）警方將如何加強打擊不法分子以高佣金方式利誘學生參與租賃詐騙的行為；會否提高相關刑罰以作阻嚇之用？

答覆：

主席：

政府留意到近日有詐騙集團針對新來港人士作出的不法租賃行為。有不法分子冒充住宅單位業主，透過社交媒體接觸欲租住單位的新來港人士，向他們訛稱可以優惠價格將單位轉租予他們，誘騙他們的租金。新來港人士由於不熟悉香港的租賃制度及求助方法，容易讓騙徒有機可乘。

政府高度關注上述與租賃相關的詐騙行為。就此，政府採取多管齊下的方法去打擊，包括加強監察有關物業租賃的廣告是否合法合規、作出針對性的執法行動及加強宣傳教育。

就議員的提問，經諮詢房屋局後，現回覆如下：

（一）政府就私人住宅租務市場方面的政策，是維持穩定的環境，減少不必要的干預，讓市場能自由運作和平穩發展。《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）為合法租賃事宜提供框架。第7章第IV部適用於一般住宅租賃，業主與租客可以根據雙方的意願自由擬定租約的內容及條款，並按照合約精神履行租約下的租賃安排。至於問題中提及有「二房東」以不法手段詐騙分租客，可能干犯欺詐相關罪行，現時已有《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）和《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）作出規管。另外，《地產代理條例》（第511章）對從事地產代理工作的公司和個人作出規管。地產代理及營業員必須遵守第511章、其附屬法例，以及地產代理監管局（地監局）發出的操守守則及執業通告，違者可能受到紀律處分。倘若持牌人因干犯刑事罪行而被定罪，其牌照可能會被地監局暫時吊銷或撤銷。

（二）地監局一直進行網絡巡查，以密切監察有關香港物業買賣及租賃的網上廣告（包括於內地和香港社交平台上發布的廣告），並檢視它們是否符合《地產代理條例》及其附屬法例的規定，例如是否載有虛假或誤導性資料。地監局近年已加強巡查工作，二○二五年上半年共抽查網上物業廣告862次，較去年同期增加21%。如發現懷疑違規個案，地監局會作出跟進調查；而如果個案涉及刑事成分（例如涉嫌詐騙），會轉介執法部門跟進。

（三）為提高新來港人士對租賃相關詐騙行為的警覺性，警方及地監局與內地相關部門及本地持份者（包括各大專院校）合作，為新來港人士在來港前後，以線上線下雙軌模式，提供防範租賃相關詐騙行為的資訊，幫助他們識別和防範騙案。

來港前的資訊

為了讓相關人士在來港前及早掌握香港的租賃制度及了解騙徒慣用的行騙技倆，除了透過在小紅書、抖音等社交媒體上發放專門為新來港人士製作的防騙宣傳資料外，警方亦與國家移民管理局、公安部刑偵局及香港入境事務處（入境處）共同製作視頻，以新來港人士的第一視覺，展示騙徒的犯案手法，提高新來港人士的警惕。國家移民管理局亦會安排準備來港的人士於申請簽證時觀看相關視頻，亦會在各口岸、內地出入境辦證大廳，以及小紅書、抖音等社交媒體播放。

為特別加強保護新來港學生，警方與國家反詐中心安排線上線下針對內地來港就讀的學生及家長的分享會，並向家長派發防騙須知信息，包括與租賃相關的詐騙行為及求助方法。

來港後的資訊

為讓新來港人士抵港後繼續保持警惕，警方透過入境處六個總區公眾服務站、勞工及福利局及全港各大專院校向新來港人士派發防騙宣傳小冊子及單張，當中包括防範不法租賃騙案的方法。

此外，為拓寬接觸面，警方與相關業界合作，包括透過地產、銀行業界及電訊商等向新來港人士分發防騙宣傳包，並會不時更新防騙宣傳材料，提醒新來港人士防範最新騙案手法，包括租賃相關詐騙行為。

另外，地監局一直致力教育消費者在租樓及買樓時需注意的事項。針對近年有新來港人士遇上有關購買或租賃樓宇的騙案，除與警方合作宣傳外，地監局亦自二○二五年初起積極與香港人才服務辦公室、駐內地的經濟貿易辦事處、消費者委員會、多間高等院校、協助新來港人士的非政府機構及本地媒體等合作，向新來港人士提供有關在港租樓及買樓的資訊，以及舉辦網上公開講座，在本地及內地社交平台同步直播，以便新來港人士掌握在港租樓買樓的步驟及防騙方面的知識。地監局亦透過內地媒體網絡發放多則網上廣告，以及參與由香港人才服務辦公室舉辦的講座，提醒消費者應委託持牌地產代理，加強自身的保障。就此，地監局的網站亦提供「牌照目錄」（www.eaa.org.hk/zh-hk/Licence-list），讓公眾可輸入代理全名或牌照號碼，核實代理是否持有有效牌照。另外，地監局亦向各合作單位派發《安心租屋指南》及《非本地學生在香港租屋指南》等小冊子，公眾亦可於地監局網站（smart.eaa.org.hk/zh-hant/刊物）下載這些刊物以作參考。未來地監局會繼續積極透過不同渠道和形式進行宣傳和教育工作，包括正籌備推出一個新的教育網站，以加強宣傳在香港租樓和買樓的步驟及注意事項，提高市民及新來港人士的防騙意識。

（四）警方一直與社交平台保持緊密協作，如發現有涉及懷疑涉及詐騙（包括與租賃相關）的內容，會要求有關平台即時移除內容，並採取適當的跟進行動。在今年一至五月，有關平台已按警方要求，檢視及移除超過三萬三千個詐騙內容。

（五）正如在回覆的前言所述，政府一直高度關注上述與租賃相關的詐騙行為，並採取多管齊下的方法去打擊，包括加強針對性執法，例如今年二月，警方進行「黑火行動」，搗破一個由黑社會操控的「假地產中介」犯罪集團，至今共拘捕14人，包括一名集團主腦、一名持牌地產代理及12名骨幹成員。該詐騙集團涉及超過270宗案件，騙款金額約三千萬港元。警方的調查仍然繼續，其中一人已被控一項「串謀欺詐」罪，不排除有更多人被起訴。

就有不法分子以佣金利誘學生參與租賃相關的詐騙行為，可能干犯欺詐相關罪行，包括《盜竊罪條例》第16A條「欺詐罪」及第17條「以欺騙手段取得財產」，最高可判處監禁分別為14年及10年。此外，根據《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）第159C條，干犯「串謀詐騙罪」者一經定罪最高可判處14年監禁。任何人因詐騙得益而被控《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》第25條「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」，最高可判處監禁14年及罰款500萬港元。視乎個案的性質及嚴重程度，警方亦會向法庭申請引用《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》第27條加重刑罰，以加強阻嚇力。任何人士切勿因一時貪念以身試法。

總括而言，政府會繼續以多管齊下的方法嚴厲打擊不法租賃騙案，並持續加強宣傳教育，提升新來港人士防範相關詐騙行為的意識。"
​立法會十題：街渡渡輪服務,2025-07-23 11:55,2025-07-23 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300285.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上易志明議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

根據政府於本年六月提交本會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會的文件，漁農自然護理署正與海事處探討允許領有第III類別牌照的漁船「一船兩用」（即容許該類船隻進行捕魚活動之餘，在符合特定條件及安全操作的前提下，亦可接載遊客出海進行休閒漁業活動）的可行性。然而，有街渡服務營辦商對此表示憂慮，指出港人北上消費已導致其乘客量持續下降，擔心「一船兩用」措施將進一步收窄其營運空間。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，過去三年各條固定班次的街渡渡輪服務航線的載客量，以及同期新增或取消了多少條街渡渡輪服務航線；

（二）政府如何確保「一船兩用」措施不會對現時持有第I類別牌照的街渡服務營辦商造成衝擊；

（三）鑑於有經營固定班次的街渡服務營辦商反映，在面對乘客量持續下降，以及保險費、維修費、燃油費及員工薪酬等營運成本不斷上升的情況下，他們已陷入經營困境，當局有何措施支援街渡服務業界；及

（四）為解決街渡服務面對的困境並促進其長遠發展，當局會否設立專案小組跟進；如會，詳情為何；如否，當局會如何推動街渡服務的持續發展，並促進其配合政府發展海島遊？

答覆：

主席：

大部分街渡渡輪並非市民大眾日常使用的公共交通工具，當中不少主要為旅遊或康樂性質，營運規模較小且屬非常規服務，為往返本港較偏遠及一般不能經由陸路到達的地點提供水路運輸。截至二○二五年六月三十日，全港共有14條固定班次的街渡航線，以及55條按需求而定的街渡航線。

就易志明議員的提問，經諮詢環境及生態局與旅遊事務署後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）過去三年（二○二二至二○二四年），固定班次的街渡渡輪航線載客量載於附件。

同期固定班次的街渡渡輪航線分別新增及減少了五條，現時航線數目為14條。減少的航線當中，「坪洲—愉景灣（經聖母神樂院）」航線（PC 6）於二○二三年由固定班次的街渡渡輪航線轉為持牌渡輪航線。

（二）根據《商船（本地船隻）（證明書及牌照事宜）規例》（第548D章），第III類別船隻只可用作捕魚及有關用途，不得載客。

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）正探討容許持有第III類別牌照的漁船在符合特定條件和安全標準的前提下，接載遊客出海進行休閒漁業或推廣本地漁業文化的活動（即「一船兩用」）的可行性，以協助捕撈漁民轉型發展休閒漁業。探討方向包括漁船改裝的標準和保險等事宜，並會適時諮詢持份者。

漁護署的初步構思是「一船兩用」的定位為推動休閒漁業發展及推廣漁業文化，擬議活動須具漁業元素，例如以特定漁具進行捕魚示範、手釣教室、漁民文化導賞活動、漁業工作坊等，而非單純載客出海或海島遊等。「一船兩用」活動與街渡接載乘客前往固定地點的定位並不相同。

（三）及（四）政府的一貫政策是公共運輸服務應由私營機構按商業原則經營，以提升效率及成本效益。政府在過去基本上對公共運輸服務並無提供直接資助。

大部分街渡渡輪服務（包括固定班次的街渡渡輪航線）每日接載的乘客量普遍較少，需求亦會因天氣及假日等因素影響而較不穩定。故此，運輸署對街渡渡輪服務的監管較具彈性，以便利營辦商因應市場需求及營運狀況調整經營模式及策略。舉例而言，運輸署容許營辦商因應需求而調整班次、票價及時間表，亦免除其提供經審核的財務資料的要求等。

此外，政府長者及合資格殘疾人士公共交通票價優惠計劃（二元優惠計劃）自二○二二年二月二十七日起擴展至獲運輸署批准參與計劃的街渡航線。現時有13條提供固定班次服務的街渡渡輪航線獲納入二元優惠計劃內，便利更多受惠人士使用有關的街渡服務。

就配合發展海島遊方面，運輸署一直與相關部門（包括旅遊事務署）保持緊密溝通，以評估乘客和遊客就海上交通服務的需求，並會因應特定地區的交通需求，主動邀請營辦商開辦特定的航線。例如，運輸署曾於二○二三年主動邀請營辦商開辦「西貢—滘西村／糧船灣」及「沙頭角—荔枝窩／鴨洲／吉澳」街渡渡輪航線，以配合有關地區因旅遊而衍生的需求。

此外，運輸署積極統籌政府部門，就街渡渡輪相關事宜（包括停靠點設施、船隻牌照、航線規劃等）提供協助。運輸署會繼續與渡輪營辦商聯繫，便利營辦商申辦合適可行的新街渡渡輪航線，並密切跟進其營運情況及實際需要，包括與其他部門召開會議，以商討適當措施促進其長遠發展。"
LCQ10: Kaito ferry services,2025-07-23 11:55,2025-07-23 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300286.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Frankie Yick and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

According to a paper submitted by the Government to the Panel on Food Safety and Environmental Hygiene of this Council in June this year, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department is exploring with the Marine Department the feasibility of allowing ""dual uses"" of Class III fishing vessels (i.e. allowing such vessels to carry out fishing activities and, subject to certain conditions and prerequisites for safe operations, to carry passengers at sea for leisure fishing). However, some operators of kaito services have expressed concern about this, pointing out that there has been a continuous decline in their patronage as a result of Hong Kong people going north for spending, and they are worried that the ""dual uses of vessels"" will further reduce their room for operation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the patronage of each of the regular kaito ferry service routes in the past three years, as well as the number of kaito ferry service routes added or cancelled during the same period;

(2) how the Government ensures that the ""dual uses of vessels"" will not impact operators of kaito services currently holding Class I licences;

(3) as some operators of regular kaito services have relayed that they are in dire straits in the face of the continuous decline in patronage and continuous increases in operating costs such as insurance premiums, maintenance costs, fuel costs and staff salaries, of the measures put in place by the authorities to support the kaito service sector; and

(4) whether, in order to resolve the plight of kaito services and facilitate their long-term development, the authorities will set up a special task force to follow up; if so, of the details; if not, how the authorities will promote the sustainable development of kaito services and facilitate their alignment with the Government's efforts to develop island tourism?

Reply:

President,

Most kaito ferry services are not public transport services used by the general public daily. Many of them are mostly intended for tourism or recreational purposes and operate on a relatively small scale, offering non-regular services and providing waterborne transport services to remote locations in Hong Kong that are generally inaccessible by land. As at June 30, 2025, there were 14 regular and 55 subject-to-demand kaito ferry routes in Hong Kong.

In consultation with the Environment and Ecology Bureau and the Tourism Commission, my consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Frankie Yick is as follows:

(1) The patronage of the regular kaito ferry routes in the past three years (2022 – 2024) is at Annex.

During the same period, there were respectively five additional and reduced regular kaito routes, and there are 14 routes at present. Among the reduced routes, the ""Peng Chau – Discovery Bay (via Trappist Monastery)"" route (PC 6) was changed from a regular kaito route to a licensed ferry route in 2023.

(2) According to the Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (Certification and Licensing) Regulation (Cap. 548D), vessels licensed as Class III vessels can only be used for fishing and related purposes, and not for carrying passengers.

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) is exploring the feasibility of allowing Class III fishing vessels to carry passengers at sea for leisure fishing or activities promoting local fishing culture (i.e. ""dual uses of vessels""), subject to certain conditions and safety prerequisites, with a view to facilitating capture fishermen to switch to and develop leisure fisheries. The directions for exploration include matters relating to modification standards for fishing vessels and insurance, and stakeholders will be consulted in a timely manner.

The AFCD's initial concept of the positioning of ""dual uses of vessels"" is to promote the development of leisure fisheries and fishing culture. Proposed activities should include fisheries-related elements, such as fishing demonstrations using specific gear, handlining tutorials, guided tours of fishermen's culture and fisheries workshops, rather than simply carrying passengers for sea cruising or island excursions. The positioning of ""dual uses of vessels"" activities is different from that of kaito ferries providing fixed-route services.

(3) and (4) The Government's established policy is that public transport services should be run by the private sector in accordance with commercial principles to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness. In the past, there was basically no direct subsidy from the Government for public transport services.

The daily patronage of most kaito ferry services (including regular kaito ferry routes) is generally low, with unstable demand due to factors such as weather and holidays. As such, the Transport Department (TD)'s monitoring of kaito ferry services is relatively flexible for facilitating the operators to adjust their business models and strategies in response to market demand and operating conditions. For instance, the TD allows operators to adjust frequencies, fares and timetables subject to demand, and exempts them from the requirements to provide audited financial information, etc.

Also, the Government Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme for the Elderly and Eligible Persons with Disabilities (the $2 Scheme) has been extended to cover kaito routes approved by the TD since February 27, 2022. Currently, 13 regular kaito ferry routes are covered by the $2 Scheme, thereby facilitating more beneficiaries to use the relevant kaito services.

With regard to aligning with the development of island tourism, the TD has maintained close communication with relevant departments (including the Tourism Commission) to assess passengers and tourists' demand for waterborne transport services, and has proactively invited operators to operate specific routes in view of the traffic demand at certain areas. For example, in 2023, the TD took the initiative to invite operators to operate the ""Sai Kung – Kau Sai Village/High Island"" and ""Sha Tau Kok – Lai Chi Wo/Ap Chau/Kat O"" kaito ferry routes to meet the tourism-driven demand at relevant areas.

In addition, the TD actively co-ordinates government departments to provide assistance on matters relating to kaito ferries (including berthing facilities, vessel licensing and route planning). The TD will continue to liaise with ferry operators to facilitate their applications for operating suitable and feasible new kaito ferry routes, and closely follow up on their operation situation and actual needs, including convening meetings with other departments to discuss appropriate measures to facilitate the long-term development of kaito ferry services."

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月二十三日）宣布硬幣收集計劃下兩輛「收銀車」新的服務日程表，羅列了從二○二五年八月十八日至二○二五年十月二十六日的服務地點。日程表及其他有關資訊載於金管局網頁（coincollection.hkma.gov.hk） 。

硬幣收集計劃自二○一四年十月份推出至二○二五年六月三十日期間，兩輛「收銀車」已進行了1 374 000宗交易，收集了共十億五仟二百萬枚硬幣，總面值十六億九仟一百萬港元。收集到的硬幣會回流市面滿足市民需要。

「收銀車」在既方便市民又不阻礙交通和行人的地點服務市民，並盡可能利用有合適電力供應裝置的地方，例如康樂及文化事務署流動圖書館服務點，從而減少使用收銀車的備用發電機，符合環保原則。在揀選服務地點的過程中，金管局考慮了區議會及市民提出的意見和建議，亦有按需要徵詢運輸署及警務處。

兩輛「收銀車」在全港18區輪流服務，向市民收集硬幣，一般情況下，視乎「收銀車」停駐地點的情況及車輛維修安排，每輛「收銀車」會在同一地點停留一星期，服務時間由上午十時至晚上七時。每輛車內有兩部硬幣點算機，並有人員協助，亦設有電動輪椅升降台。市民可將硬幣轉換成鈔票或增值至儲值支付工具，例如八達通卡或電子錢包（包括支付寶香港、八達通銀包、拍住賞及WeChat Pay），或將款項放入車內的公益金捐款箱。硬幣收集服務不收費用。

金管局會不時檢討計劃成效，並按時更新服務日程表以便預早通知市民。"
Coin Collection Programme,2025-07-23 11:42,2025-07-23 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300322.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (July 23) announced a new service schedule of the two Coin Carts under the Coin Collection Programme, for the period of August 18, 2025 up to October 26, 2025. The schedule and other details of the Programme are shown on the HKMA webpage (coincollection.hkma.gov.hk).

Since the launch of the Programme in October 2014 up to June 30, 2025, the two Coin Carts had carried out 1 374 000 transactions, collecting 1 052 million coins with a total face value of HK$1,691 million during the period. The collected coins are re-circulated to meet demand.

The Coin Carts provide service at locations that are convenient to the public without affecting the normal flow of traffic and pedestrians. Locations that have suitable power supply facilities, such as the Leisure and Cultural Services Department mobile library service locations, are preferred so as to reduce the need for using the Coin Carts' own stand-by generators. This makes the Programme more environmentally friendly. In selecting the service locations, the HKMA has taken into consideration comments and suggestions given by district councils and members of public; and has consulted the Transport Department and the Hong Kong Police Force as necessary.

The two Coin Carts collect coins from members of public in the 18 districts of Hong Kong on a rotating basis. Under normal circumstances each Coin Cart will stay at a location for a week, subject to availability of the parking space and the maintenance schedule of the Cart. Service hours are from 10am to 7pm. Each vehicle is equipped with two coin counting machines and operational staff will be present to provide assistance. An electrical wheelchair lift is available for use. Users can choose to exchange coins for banknotes or adding value to their stored value facilities, such as Octopus Cards or e-wallets (including AlipayHK, Octopus Wallet, Tap&Go and WeChat Pay). There is also a Community Chest donation box inside each vehicle. The coin collection service is free of charge.

The HKMA will review the Programme from time to time; and will regularly update the service schedule to give advance notice to the public."

政制及內地事務局局長在立法會《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》委員會會議開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-23 11:26,2025-07-23 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300293.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（七月二十三日）在立法會《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》委員會會議的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

十分感謝陳勇主席今日召開法案委員會首次會議，審議《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》）。這份草案充分展示特區政府的堅定立場：一是恪守司法裁決的積極義務責任、二是捍衞我們傳統婚姻的堅定立場、三是致力平衡社會整體利益的管治擔當。

首先，正如我在二讀《條例草案》時表示，特區政府堅決維護法治的決心從不動搖。按照終審法院的裁決，政府有積極義務，須於兩年內建立替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，並制定伴隨的適當權利和責任。這份《條例草案》正是我們充分展示對法治的堅守，從不因為議題具爭議性而有所動搖。《條例草案》的目的十分清晰，就是設立一個替代框架，使同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，保障其私生活權利不受侵擾，同時制定承認同性伴侶關係而賦予的核心權利和責任。

特區政府深切明白部分議員與市民的憂慮，擔心《條例草案》若獲得通過，將衝擊「一夫一妻、一男一女」的傳統婚姻制度。我在此再次鄭重重申：特區的婚姻自由僅限於異性結合，這是《基本法》和《香港人權法案》的明確規定，終審法院亦已作出清晰的裁決確認，絕沒有轉寰的餘地。而我們現時建議推出的同性伴侶關係登記機制，與目前的「一夫一妻、一男一女」婚姻制度絕不能混為一談。而作為負責任的政府，我們亦早已開宗明義表示，特區政府維護傳統婚姻的決心堅如磐石。

在履行積極義務的同時，特區政府亦積極尋求社會的最大公約數。終審法院明確表示，特區政府與立法機關在制定相關法律承認機制和所賦予的核心權利和義務時，絕對有彈性的酌情空間。而在精準對焦法院判詞所提及滿足同性伴侶的「基本社會需求」的同時，我們亦盡力避免任何可能觸及婚姻傳統制度受影響或引發社會重大爭議的情況。《條例草案》中建議所包含的權利，旨在解決同性伴侶在現實生活中因缺乏法律身分承認和保障而導致出現的重大困難，從而滿足他們的「基本社會需求」，而制定承認機制的登記必須條件亦是充分考慮了香港的實際情況、社會整體利益和公眾期望，取其平衡，盡量為各方所接受。

主席，以上我扼要重申了政府立法的因由和重要原則。提交《條例草案》是為了履行我們在終審法院裁決下的積極義務，並恪守香港核心的法治精神。我深信各位議員必定能夠以理性持平、實事求是的態度，專業審議《條例草案》，妥善落實我們在《香港人權法案》下的積極義務。我們歡迎委員就《條例草案》提出具體建議，以優化和完善方案。今日除了我和政制及內地事務局的同事外，亦有律政司的代表，我們樂意聽取各位委員的意見和建議，並解答各位委員就《條例草案》的關注和提問。

多謝主席。"
立法會二十二題：體育場館的減廢措施,2025-07-23 11:20,2025-07-23 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300287.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上江玉歡議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）將於本年十一月在粵港澳三地舉行，其一大亮點是深入踐行綠色辦賽理念，致力於打造全國運動會歷史上首屆碳中和賽事。然而，有意見認為啟德體育園（體育園）作為新落成的國際級旗艦場館，其減廢措施仍有進一步完善空間。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於體育園過去以保安為由，禁止觀眾於體育賽事攜帶任何容器入場，並拒絕提供重用杯，但據報在多場於該園舉行的大型體育賽事中，企業包廂及貴賓席卻出現各種禁攜容器，當局有否檢視為何出現標準不一的情況，以及未來會如何確保相關規定的公平性和一致性；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，體育園於本年四月舉辦演唱會期間容許觀眾攜帶塑料或硅膠水瓶及杯入場，但未有於舉辦體育活動期間實施有關安排，令本地及海外觀眾無所適從，（i）上述安排未有於不同類型活動統一實施的原因為何，以及（ii）政府會否要求體育園清晰界定實施上述安排的活動類別及具體理由；

（三）鑑於有意見認為本港在重用容器系統方面已有成熟經驗，很多大型商場、連鎖餐飲企業及多項大型活動（例如以往在香港大球場舉行的香港國際七人欖球賽）均成功實踐「以重用代替即棄」的安排，有效減少廢物量，而據悉體育園亦以「永續」（即致力融合有利於可持續發展的營運方案，並加強資源利用）作為其中一項核心價值，該園至今未推行重用容器系統的原因為何；及

（四）在十五運會中，香港賽區場館（包括體育園及其他賽事場地）將如何具體落實「綠色、共享、開放、廉潔」辦賽理念中的「綠色」元素，以打造出粵港澳大灣區具示範作用的十五運會場館？

答覆：

主席：

啟德體育園是香港歷來最大型的體育基建，對政府推動體育和盛事經濟的發展至為重要。在今年三月一日正式啟用後，啟德體育園已迅速成為多項大型體育和娛樂盛事的新據點。

啟德體育園有限公司（營運公司）致力為到園區參加大型體育和娛樂盛事的人士帶來良好體驗，繼續做好活動安排和場地保安等重要工作的同時，亦不斷優化園區的日常管理和運作，包括在園區推動環保低碳的措施等。

就江玉歡議員的提問，在諮詢環境保護署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）為確保舉辦大型活動時的安全和秩序，所有進入啟德體育園各個場地參加活動的人士必須遵守營運公司訂明的場地規則，以及因應活動主辦單位的需求而制定的入場條款，例如不可攜帶外來食品和飲料、長雨傘、玻璃或金屬容器等進入場館。所有入場觀眾，包括在包廂和嘉賓席的觀眾，都須遵守同樣的規則和條款。

個別活動的主辦單位可能會因應其活動的性質和安排，在營運公司的批准下在指定區域為主辦單位的嘉賓提供特別的餐飲安排。營運公司會在不影響活動安全的前提下考慮相關要求。特別餐飲安排亦只適用於指定區域，例如容許在包廂內使用玻璃杯；在指定區域以外，例如到包廂外相連觀眾席的範圍觀賞節目時，包廂使用者仍須遵守場地規則，包括不可使用玻璃杯。

（二）因應體育賽事和娛樂活動不同的性質和風險，營運公司為這兩個類別的活動訂明了不同的場地規則。

體育賽事的本質是競技性，當參賽隊伍相互較勁和對陣時，尤其在競爭激烈的情況下，球迷之間的互動較容易引發衝突。因此，觀眾在觀看體育賽事時一般不可攜帶任何容量的水瓶及容器（不論有否附帶蓋子）進入場館，目的是防止有人將水瓶或容器向場內其他觀眾或球員投擲，以確保場內人士的安全。事實上，香港另一個主要大型體育場地香港大球場和其他國際體育場館在進行體育賽事時亦有因應保安理由實施相類似的要求。

至於娛樂活動（如演唱會），由於不涉及參賽隊伍相互較勁和對陣，引發觀眾衝突的機會較低，營運公司和主辦單位一般會容許觀眾攜帶容量不超過600毫升的塑料或硅膠水瓶／杯入場，但不得附有瓶／杯蓋及任何液體。

營運公司在大型活動舉行前會透過營運公司的網頁和其他方式（如社交媒體、新聞稿或主辦單位的活動指南）發放該活動相應的場地規則和入場條款，讓準備到場的觀眾清楚了解有關安排，並提前做好準備。營運公司過去亦有解釋不同入場規則的詳情和考慮。

（三）營運公司積極推動可持續發展，在確保安全、衞生和高效營運的前提下，多管齊下配合政府推動環保的工作。

在秉持惜物減廢和資源循環的目標下，啟德體育園內設置廢物分類和回收設施，並安裝廢物分解系統，把廚餘、紙杯及其他紙製容器轉化為堆肥材料，轉化的堆肥材料全數可用於園區內各處的植物作施肥之用，體現綠色管理和資源循環再用的理念。為進一步推動環保，營運公司在場館內使用的紙杯均屬經環保認證的可降解紙杯，一方面推動「走塑」文化和減少觀眾使用塑膠餐具，另一方面能保障衞生標準，提升觀眾體驗。

在制定上述場館管理措施時，營運公司已進行研究，並參考香港和其他地區的做法。就使用可重用塑膠容器的建議，營運公司詳細考慮後認為運送和清洗可重用容器等過程會產生額外的碳排放及運用其他資源，加上重用塑膠容器不可降解，既不能「走塑」，亦削弱了啟德體育園推動減碳和資源循環再用的效果；而使用可降解紙杯則能充分配合和善用上文解釋的啟德體育園廢物分解系統，整體的減碳效果相對較佳。

文化體育及旅遊局和環境保護署將繼續與營運公司保持緊密聯繫，讓參與啟德體育園大型活動的觀眾在獲得良好體驗的同時，推動園區持續加強在環保方面的工作。

（四）為貫切「簡約、安全、精彩」的辦賽要求和「綠色、共享、開放、廉潔」的辦賽理念，粵港澳三地將共同努力為第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會達致碳中和目標。全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室已就此制定「綠色全運」工作方案，並已聘請專業檢測機構，就建立碳中和架構與協作機制、碳排放測算與核算、推動公眾參與綠色推廣及碳補償與認證等方面開展相關的工作。香港賽區的綠色減碳措施包括：使用現有的體育設施及場地辦賽；在比賽場館進行節能減碳措施及使用更多可再生能源，如塗上無電製冷塗層及安裝太陽能板等，以減少場館的耗電；倡導綠色出行及透過贊助取得新能源汽車提供接送服務；推廣綠色住宿；加強使用電子渠道宣傳及電子工具作文件分享，以推廣無紙化辦賽；加強分類和回收固體廢物；以及在比賽場地設置綠色及環保的展覽和遊戲，以推廣及介紹綠色全運的辦賽理念。"
立法會九題：優化輸入勞工政策,2025-07-23 11:20,2025-07-23 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300276.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上周小松議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

關於優化輸入勞工政策，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據報有僱主透過「假招聘」（例如在面試後以不符合要求拒絕聘用合適的本地求職者）營造「本地請不到人」的假象，以便其向政府申請輸入勞工，亦有不良僱主透過各種方式剝削其聘請的輸入勞工而出現「廉價外勞」問題，有意見指出該等違規做法嚴重影響本地工友就業，政府會否考慮設立黑名單制度，定期公布查明屬實違反輸入勞工規定的公司資料（包括公司名稱、所屬行業、違規事項的性質和日期、涉及的輸入勞工計劃及當局的跟進行動等），以加強監察和提高阻嚇力；

（二）會否研究設立行政罰款制度的可行性，向違反輸入勞工相關規定（包括聘用輸入勞工後，便減少本地員工的工時或將其解僱等）的僱主處以嚴厲罰款，以增強阻嚇力；

（三）鑑於有意見指出目前「補充勞工優化計劃」的常見職位表內部分工種（特別是飲食業工種）的每月中位工資均低於市場水平，或會拖低從事相關工種的本地工友工資，甚至削弱僱主聘用本地工友的意欲，當局會否檢視和優化釐定該職位表內工資中位數水平的方法，使有關水平更能貼近市場水平；

（四）鑑於有意見認為政府統計處定期發布有關本地勞工市場的統計數字（包括勞動人口數目、失業率、就業不足率、就業人士的每月就業收入等）未有將輸入勞工的數據分開處理，以致該等統計數字難以有效反映輸入勞工政策對本地勞動市場（包括本地工友就業和薪酬）的影響，當局會否探討定期統計並發布已撇除輸入勞工因素的相關勞工市場數字；及

（五）會否考慮定期主動公布輸入勞工的數據（包括按輸入勞工計劃類別、行業和工種劃分的申請、獲批和已到港工作的輸入勞工數目，以及聘用輸入勞工的企業數目和其名稱、所涉行業和聘請本地僱員與輸入勞工人數），以便社會更好地了解輸入勞工政策的推行情況？

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，政府適度容許僱主申請輸入勞工。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九‍月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

就議員的提問，經諮詢政府統計處後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）為保障本地勞工優先就業，優化計劃的申請僱主必須先進行四星期本地公開招聘，以不低於市場相類職位的每月工資中位數，優先聘請合資格的本地工人填補空缺。僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果並遞交招聘廣告作核對。勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情，並確定僱主匯報不聘用的原因是否與事實相符及合理，從而評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會中止處理有關申請。勞工處亦會向僱主施加行政制裁，拒絕處理有關僱主在隨後一年提交的其他申請。同時，獲批准輸入勞工的僱主，必須與輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約，並支付不低於相類職位中位工資的薪金，防止輸入勞工成為廉價勞工，損害本地工人的就業機會。

由今年六月十七日起，勞工處實施一系列加強保障本地工人優先就業的新措施，包括在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴；在「互動就業服務」網站刊登優化計劃本地招聘的職位空缺資料時，展示申請公司名稱，提高本地招聘的資訊透明度；進行特別巡查行動，到聘用輸入勞工的企業查核僱主有否持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例二比一的規定；按違規風險，要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例；以及拒絕處理同一僱主在遞交申請後六個月內提交的其他申請等。此外，勞工處於七月推出額外措施，加強監察申請僱主進行本地招聘的安排，確保本地招聘過程公正和真誠。

優化計劃亦規定僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職的本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。如有足夠證據證明僱主違反有關規定，勞工處會作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准、拒絕處理僱主其後兩年的輸入勞工申請等。

輸入勞工待遇方面，政府高度重視保障他們的僱傭權益。輸入勞工同樣受香港勞工法例的保障，政府採取多管齊下的策略，包括要求僱主及輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約，規定工資以自動轉帳方式直接存入輸入勞工的香港銀行戶口；突擊巡查輸入勞工的工作場所；舉辦僱傭權益簡介會確保輸入勞工了解其僱傭權益等。對於輸入勞工懷疑被剝削事件，政府已成立跨部門專責小組跟進，調查是否涉及刑事成分。如有足夠證據，執法部門會作出檢控行動。此外，勞工處於今年一月推出「輸入勞工支援計劃」，加強向懷疑被剝削的輸入勞工提供支援，包括個案諮詢、跟進及輔導，協助被僱主解僱的輸入勞工安排臨時住宿及申領相關津貼等。

（三）經諮詢相關政府決策局／部門／培訓機構／專業團體及參考優化計劃較常審理的申請職位資料，勞工處編製優化計劃下的常見職位表（包括相關職位的職責範圍、學歷要求、年資、每日正常工作時數及每月中位工資），當中每月中位工資主要由政府統計處在指定統計月份內就相關在職勞動人口所賺取的工資資料而釐定。勞工處會繼續密切留意本地勞工市場及相關數據，持續檢視優化計劃的運作和實施安排，致力保障本地工人優先就業。

（四）政府統計處通過定期進行抽樣統計調查，編製及發布本港勞動人口、就業、失業及就業不足等勞工統計數字，反映整體勞動人口（包括在港的輸入勞工）的最新狀況。由於在港的輸入勞工只佔本港勞動人口極少數，相關細分數字存在很大的抽樣誤差，考慮到統計數字的準確性，難以分拆輸入勞工的因素獨立發布。

（五）政府定期向勞工顧問委員會匯報輸入勞工計劃的實施情況和相關數據，並繼續密切留意本地勞工市場及各行業人力情況的變化，持續檢視各行業輸入勞工計劃及優化計劃的運作和實行安排，確保保障本地工人優先就業的措施得以落實。"
LCQ9: Improving labour importation policy,2025-07-23 11:20,2025-07-23 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300280.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chau Siu-chung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

 Regarding the improvement of labour importation policy, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it has been reported that some employers have engaged in ""bogus recruitment"" (e.g. rejecting suitable local job seekers after interviews on the grounds that they do not meet the requirements) in order to create the false impression of difficulties in local recruitment, so as to justify applications to the Government for labour importation, while some unscrupulous employers have exploited the imported labour they employed through various means, resulting in the issue of ""cheap imported labour"", and there are views pointing out that such non-compliant practices severely undermine employment opportunities for local workers, whether the Government will consider establishing a blacklist system to regularly publish information on companies involved in substantiated cases of violation of labour importation regulations (including company names, the industries to which they belong, nature and dates of violations, the labour importation schemes involved, and follow-up actions taken by the authorities), so as to enhance monitoring and increase deterrence;

(2) whether it will study the feasibility of introducing an administrative penalty system to impose heavy fines on employers who violate regulations related to imported labour (including reducing the working hours of local employees or dismissing them after recruiting imported labour) in order to enhance deterrence;

(3) as there are views pointing out that the median monthly wages for some job categories (particularly those in the catering industry) on the List of Common Posts under the current Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme are below market levels, which may bring down the wages for local workers in related job categories and even discourage employers from recruiting local workers, whether the authorities will review and refine the methodology for determining the median wage levels on the List to better align them with market levels;

(4) as there are views that local labour market statistics (including size of labour force, unemployment rate, underemployment rate and monthly employment earnings of employed persons) regularly published by the Census and Statistics Department do not process data on imported labour separately, making it difficult for such statistics to effectively reflect the impact of labour importation policy on the local labour market (including the employment and wages of local workers), whether the authorities will consider regularly compiling and publishing relevant labour market statistics that exclude the factor of imported labour; and

(5) whether the authorities will consider proactively and regularly publishing statistics on imported labour (including the numbers of applications, approvals and arrivals to Hong Kong for work, broken down by labour importation scheme, industry and job category, as well as the number and names of enterprises employing imported labour, the industries involved, and the number of local employees and imported workers), so that society can better understand the implementation of the labour importation policy?

Reply:

President,

 To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government suitably allows employers to apply for importation of workers. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

 In consultation with the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) To safeguard employment priority for local workers, applicant employers of the ESLS must undertake a four-week local open recruitment and accord priority to employing qualified local workers to fill the job vacancies at a salary not lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market. Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results and submit recruitment advertisements to the LD for verification. The LD will contact each of the unsuccessful local job seekers to verify the interview details and confirm if the reasons for not employing the job seekers as reported by the employers are consistent with the facts and reasonable, so as to assess whether the employers have sincerity in recruiting local workers. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable grounds, the LD will terminate the processing of the relevant application. The LD will also impose administrative sanction on the employer and refuse to process any other application(s) submitted by the employer concerned in the following year. In parallel, employers approved to import workers are required to sign a Standard Employment Contract (SEC) with imported workers, and shall pay a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position to prevent the imported workers from becoming ""cheap labour"" and undermining the employment opportunities of local workers.

 Since June 17 this year, the LD has implemented a series of new measures to strengthen the protection of the employment priority for local workers, including launching an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers for suspected breaches of the requirements of the ESLS, displaying the names of applicant companies when publishing job vacancies for local recruitment under the ESLS on the Interactive Employment Service website to increase the information transparency of local recruitment, launching a special inspection campaign to check whether establishments employing imported workers have continuously met the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1, requiring employers to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratios based on a risk-based approach, and refusing to process other application(s) submitted by the same employer within six months after the employer submitted an application under the ESLS. Besides, the LD launched additional measures in July to strengthen monitoring of employers' local recruitment arrangements to ensure fairness and authenticity in the local recruitment process.

 The ESLS also requires employers not to displace local workers with imported workers. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. If there is sufficient evidence substantiating violation of the relevant requirements, the LD will impose administrative sanction, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted to the employer and refusal to process applications for labour importation submitted by the employer in the following two years.

 With regard to the treatment of imported workers, the Government attaches great importance to protecting their employment rights and benefits. Imported workers also enjoy the protection of labour laws in Hong Kong. The Government adopts a multi-pronged strategy, including requiring employers and imported workers to sign the SEC, requiring that wages be paid directly into imported workers' bank accounts in Hong Kong by automatic payment, conducting surprise inspections to workplaces of imported workers, and organising briefings on employment rights to ensure imported workers understand their employment rights and benefits. For cases of suspected exploitation of imported workers, the Government has set up an inter-departmental task force to follow up and investigate whether criminal elements are involved. If there is sufficient evidence, law enforcement agencies will take out prosecution. In addition, the LD launched the Imported Workers Support Scheme in January this year to strengthen support for imported workers who are suspected of being exploited, including case consultation, follow-up and guidance, as well as assisting imported workers whose employment has been terminated by their employers to arrange temporary accommodation and apply for relevant subsidies.

(3) In consultation with relevant government bureaux/ departments/ training bodies/ professional organisations and making reference to details of the applied posts commonly processed under the ESLS, the LD complies the List of Common Posts under the ESLS (including the scope of duties, academic requirements, years of experience, normal working hours per day, and median monthly wages of relevant posts). Among others, the median monthly wages are mainly determined by the C&SD's data of wages earned by relevant employed labour force in the specified survey reference month. The LD will continue to closely monitor the local labour market and relevant statistics, and continuously review the operation and implementation arrangements of the ESLS, striving to safeguard the employment priority for local workers.

(4) To reflect the latest conditions of the overall labour force (including imported workers in Hong Kong), the C&SD conducts regular sample surveys to compile and disseminate statistics on the labour force, employment, unemployment and underemployment, etc, in Hong Kong. As imported workers in Hong Kong only constitute a very small proportion of the labour force, the relevant breakdowns will have significant sampling error. Taking into account the accuracy of the statistics, it is difficult to segregate the factor of imported workers and publish the statistics separately.

(5) The Government reports regularly to the Labour Advisory Board on the implementation and relevant statistics of the labour importation schemes, and will continue to closely monitor changes in the local labour market and the manpower situation of different industries, and from time to time review the operation and implementation arrangements of the sector-specific labour importation schemes and the ESLS to ensure measures for safeguarding employment priority for local workers are implemented."
LCQ22: Waste reduction measures in sports stadiums,2025-07-23 11:20,2025-07-23 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300290.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Doreen Kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

The 15th National Games (NG) will be held in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in November this year. One of the key highlights of the Games is the thorough implementation of green initiatives in organising the event, and the endeavour to make it the first carbon-neutral event in the history of NG. However, there are views that the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), which is a newly-opened international flagship stadium, still has room for improvement in its waste reduction measures. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the KTSP previously prohibited audience from bringing any containers into sport events for security reasons and declined to provide reusable cups, but it has been reported that various types of prohibited containers were found in the corporate boxes and VIP seats during several major sport events held in the Park, whether the authorities have reviewed why there were such inconsistencies in the standards, and how they will ensure the fairness and consistency in the relevant requirements in the future;

(2) as there are views pointing out that while the KTSP allowed audience to bring plastic or silicone water bottles and cups into the venue during concerts held in April this year, relevant arrangements were not made for sport events which had left local and overseas audience at a loss, (i) of the reasons why the aforesaid arrangements were not implemented consistently for different types of events, and (ii) whether the Government will request the KTSP to clearly define the types of events for which the aforesaid arrangements are to be implemented and the specific justifications;

(3) as there are views that Hong Kong has mature experience in reusable container systems, and that the arrangement of ""reuse instead of disposal"" has been successfully implemented in many large shopping centres, restaurant chains and major events (e.g. the Hong Kong Sevens held at the Hong Kong Stadium in the past), which are effective in reducing the amount of waste, and it is learnt that the KTSP has also adopted ""sustainability"" (i.e. striving to integrate operational solutions conducive to sustainable development, and optimising resource usage) as one of its core values, of the reasons for not implementing the reusable container systems in the KTSP so far; and

(4) how the stadiums in Hong Kong (including the KTSP and other competition venues) will specifically implement the element of green initiatives under the principles of ""green, inclusive, open and clean"" during the 15th NG, so as to create exemplary venues for the 15th ‍NG in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area?

Reply:

President,

The Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is the largest sports infrastructure in HongKong's history and is crucial for the Government's promotion of the development of sports and mega event economy. With its official commissioning on March 1 this year, the KTSP has quickly established itself as a new hub for hosting major sports and entertainment events.

The Kai Tak Sports Park Limited (the Operator) is committed to providing an enjoyable experience for visitors attending major sports and entertainment events at the KTSP. While ensuring proper implementation of areas of importance such as event arrangements and venue security, the Operator is also dedicated to optimising the daily management and operations of the KTSP, including promoting environmentally friendly and low-carbon measures.

In consultation with the Environmental Protection Department (EPD), my reply to the questions raised by the Hon Doreen Kong is as follows:

(1) To ensure safety and order when staging large-scale events, all visitors entering the venues of the KTSP must comply with the venue rules set out by the Operator, as well as the conditions of entry stipulated in response to the requirements of event organisers. For instance, outside food and drinks, long umbrellas, glass or metal containers etc, are prohibited from being brought into the venues. All spectators, including those in suites and VIP areas, must adhere to the same rules and conditions.

Depending on the nature and arrangements of the event, individual organisers may arrange for special catering services for their guests in designated areas, subject to the Operator's approval. The Operator will consider such requests provided that they do not affect the safety of the events. Such special catering services will apply to designated areas only. For example, the use of glass containers is only allowed inside the suite area. When enjoying the event at the balcony seats of the suite, suite users still need to follow the same venue rules, including the prohibition on using glass containers.

(2) In view of the varying nature and risks between sports and entertainment events, the Operator has established different venue rules for the two event categories.

The essence of sports events is competitiveness. When competing teams are battling against each other, especially in intense situations, the interaction among the fans could more easily lead to confrontations. Therefore, spectators at sports events are generally not allowed to bring water bottles or containers of any size (whether capped or not) into the venues so as to prevent such bottles or containers from being thrown at other spectators or players, thereby ensuring the safety of everyone inside the venue. In fact, another major sports venue in Hong Kong, namely the Hong Kong Stadium, as well as other international sports stadiums also stipulate similar requirements during sports events for security reasons.

For entertainment events (such as concerts), since there is no competition between battling teams, the likelihood of conflict among the audience is lower. The Operator and event organisers generally allow spectators to bring empty plastic or silicone reusable bottles/cups not larger than 600millilitres with bottle/cups caps and liquids removed.

The Operator will disseminate relevant rules and conditions of entry through its website and other channels (such as social media, press releases, or event guides from the organisers) before the staging of large-scale events to ensure that spectators are well-informed to facilitate their preparation in advance. The Operator has indeed explained the details and considerations of different rules and entry conditions in past events.

(3) The Operator is dedicated to promoting sustainable development. While ensuring safety, hygiene and effective operations, the Operator has been collaborating with the Government to promote environmental protection through a multi-pronged approach.

Adhering to the objectives of ""Use Less, Waste Less"" and resources circulation, the KTSP has placed waste separation and recycling facilities as well as installed a waste decomposition system to convert food waste, paper cups, and other paper containers into compostable materials. All the compost produced can be used as fertiliser for plants within the precinct, showcasing the concepts of green management and resources circulation. To further promote environmental protection, all paper cups used by the Operator in the KTSP are certified biodegradable. This promotes a plastic-free culture, reducing the use of plastic tableware by spectators on one hand, while helping to maintain hygiene standards and enhance audience experience on the other.

The Operator has conducted research and made reference to practices in Hong Kong and other regions when formulating the above venue management measures. On the suggestion of using reusable plastic containers, after careful consideration, the Operator concluded that the processes involved in transporting and cleaning these reusable containers would generate additional carbon emissions and consume other resources. In addition, as reusable plastic containers are not biodegradable, they do not support the plastic-free initiative and undermine the KTSP's efforts in promoting carbon reduction and resources circulation. In contrast, the use of biodegradable paper cups aligns well with and makes good use of the above-mentioned waste decomposition system at the KTSP, leading to a better overall carbon reduction outcome.

The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the EPD will continue to maintain close communication with the Operator to further promote environmental protection work at the KTSP, while ensuring that spectators attending major events continue to have an enjoyable experience.

(4) To adhere to the principle of ""simple, safe and wonderful"", and the philosophy of being ""green, inclusive, open and clean"" in organising the Games, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao will make joint efforts in achieving the goal of carbon neutrality for the 15th National Games, the 12thNational Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympics Games. The National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) has formulated a ""Green National Games"" action plan and engaged a professional carbon auditing agency to carry out the related works such as establishing a carbon-neutral framework and collaborative initiatives, conducting comprehensive carbon emission measurement and accounting, promoting public participation in green initiatives and managing carbon offset and certification. The green and carbon-reduction measures in Hong Kong include using existing sports facilities and venues for the Games; implementing energy-saving strategies and increasing renewable energy use at competition venues (for example, applying electricity-free cooling coating and installing solar panels); advocating green transportation and securing new energy vehicles for shuttle services through sponsorship; promoting environmentally friendly accommodation; strengthening the use of digital publicity and document sharing to minimise paper use; enhancing waste separation and recycling; and setting up green exhibitions and games at competition venues to promote the concept of ""Green National Games""."
LCQ11: Mechanism of direct issue of Hong Kong full driving licence,2025-07-23 11:15,2025-07-23 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300268.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Dennis Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

Under the existing legislation, a person holding an overseas driving licence issued by a recognised country or place may be directly issued with a Hong Kong full driving licence without taking a local driving test (direct issue of driving licence). It has been reported that queuing gangs have recently been blatantly offering facilitation service for direct issue of driving licence in the vicinity of the Hong Kong Licensing Office of the Transport Department (the Licensing Office) and on social media platforms (such as Xiaohongshu, etc), and some individuals have been transferring their same-day queue tickets after waiting in line early in the morning at the Licensing Office, raising suspicions of abuse of services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the aforementioned facilitation service is illegal;

(2) whether it has reviewed if the existing legislation is adequate in combating the suspected abuse of services and transfer of queue tickets as mentioned above; if so, of the details;

(3) of the measures the Government will adopt to combat the suspected abuse of services and transfer of queue tickets as mentioned above, including whether it will consider conducting decoy operations on social media platforms (such as Xiaohongshu) or at the Licensing Office; if so, of the details; and

(4) given the current significant demand for direct issue of driving licence, whether the authorities will consider optimising the existing ticket distribution mechanism or application process (including the existing system of online appointment booking for services), so as to shorten applicants' waiting time and enhance overall efficiency?

Reply:

President,

The Transport Department (TD) implements direct issue of a Hong Kong full driving licence without test (""direct issue"") in accordance with regulation 11(3) of the Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations (Cap. 374B) (the Regulations), which allows a person holding a driving licence issued by one of the 32 countries and places specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Regulations (recognised countries or places) to be directly issued with a Hong Kong full driving licence without taking a local driving test for driving private cars, light goods vehicles, motor cycles and/or motor tricycles, provided that specified conditions are met.

According to the Regulations, to apply for ""direct issue"", the driving licence issued by the relevant recognised country or place must still be valid or expired for not more than three years, and be obtained by the applicant after successful completion of a driving test conducted in the issuing country or place. Also, the applicant must be aged 18 years or above and meet one of the following requirements: (1) the driving licence held was issued during a period of the applicant's residence of not less than six months in the issuing country or place; or (2) the applicant has been holding the driving licence issued by the recognised country or place for not less than five years immediately prior to the application; or (3) the applicant is the holder of a passport or other equivalent travel document issued in the country or place in which the driving licence was issued.

A consolidated reply to the various parts of the question raised by Dr the Hon Dennis Lam is as follows:

(1) to (3) For the convenience of the general public, the TD, as in the case of other licensing services, allows applicants for ""direct issue"" to choose to submit their applications and supporting documents in person or by authorised persons (including family members, friends, etc) based on their own needs. To meet the eligibility criteria of ""direct issue"" under the Regulations, an applicant or his/her authorised person should, when submitting an application, produce the relevant original copies of various supporting documents which are authentic and accurate (including a valid driving licence issued by the recognised country or place, the applicant's passport/other travel document, proof of address or Certificate of Driving Licence Particulars, etc) for on-site inspection by TD staff. The TD has been processing the applications in a stringent manner to ensure that all applications are correctly approved.

Currently, applicants for ""direct issue"" may use counter services and submit application documents through making online appointments or obtaining same-day queue tickets at the Licensing Offices. As regards obtaining same-day queue tickets, in order to maintain the good order of queuing, the TD has further stepped up staff patrols, set up additional barriers to separate those queuing up for the tickets for ""direct issue"" and those for the tickets for general driving licensing services, and demarcated designated areas for queuing. In addition, in relation to ""direct issue"", the TD will specify the sequence of queuing tickets to prevent situations such as queue-jumping. The TD has been posting notices and deploying staff and security guards to provide on-site assistance as appropriate. Any acts found to be disrupting public order will be reported to the Hong Kong Police Force for follow-up.

To strengthen verification of the identity of queuers, the TD has enhanced the queue ticketing system for same-day queue tickets to ensure that a person using the same identification document (ID) can only obtain one queue ticket for each time slot. The counter staff will conduct strict checking of the ID number of the user and ascertain that the queuer is the one who uses the counter services, so as to curb transfer of queue tickets. Once an unauthorised transfer of queue ticket is found, all relevant queue tickets will become void immediately and the applications will not be processed.

To address the issue of individuals touting facilitation services after obtaining same-day queue tickets, the TD will further enhance the queue ticketing system from mid-August 2025, whereby all queuers will be required to input both the ID numbers of their own and those of the applicants for ""direct issue"", which will then be printed on the tickets. When a ticket holder uses the counter services, the counter staff will verify his/her ID numbers and those of the applicant. If either of these ID numbers does not match with those printed on the ticket, the ticket will become void and the application will not be processed. This enhanced arrangement will deter individuals from touting with the same-day queue tickets obtained. The TD will publicise the latest operational arrangement of the queue ticketing system on its website and announce the relevant information through social media. The TD staff will post notices on-site and provide assistance to members of the public at the venue.

(4) The TD has been highly concerned about the situation of queue ticketing and online appointments, and has implemented targeted enhancement measures. Apart from the aforementioned enhanced arrangements for same-day queue tickets, in terms of online appointments, the TD will strengthen its co-operation with the relevant issuers of driving licences. For example, starting from September 2025, applicants' information in relation to Mainland driving licences provided via online appointments will be checked. If the information is found to be untrue, the relevant online appointment will be cancelled and the quota will be reopened for appointment by other applicants. The relevant measures will ensure the enhancement of effective operation of the system.

The TD will keep in view of the effectiveness of the aforementioned enhancement measures and make timely adjustments to the relevant arrangements, as well as continue to promote the digitalisation of licensing services, thereby allocating more counters for processing applications which require counter services such as ""direct issue""."
​立法會十一題：免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照的機制,2025-07-23 11:15,2025-07-23 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300266.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上林順潮議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

根據目前法例，持有認可國家或地區簽發的海外駕駛執照的人士，可無須通過本地駕駛考試，獲直接簽發香港正式駕駛執照（免試簽發駕駛執照）。據報近日有「排隊黨」公然在運輸署香港牌照事務處（該牌照處）附近及社交平台（例如小紅書等）兜售免試簽發駕駛執照代辦服務，並有人清早在該牌照處輪候領取即日籌號後轉讓，懷疑濫用服務。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述代辦服務是否違法；

（二）有否檢視現行法例是否足以打擊上述懷疑濫用服務及轉讓籌號的行為；如有，詳情為何；

（三）政府將採用甚麼方法打擊上述懷疑濫用服務及轉讓籌號的行為，包括會否考慮在社交平台（例如小紅書）或該牌照處進行「放蛇」行動；如會，詳情為何；及

（四）鑑於目前免試簽發駕駛執照有龐大需求，當局會否考慮優化現行的派籌機制或申請流程（包括現時網上預約服務系統），以縮短申請者的等候時間並提升整體效率？

答覆：

主席：

運輸署按照《道路交通（駕駛執照）規例》（第374B章）（《規例》）第11（3）條的規定執行免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照（「免試簽發」），讓持有由《規例》附表4載列的32個國家和地方（認可國家或地方）所簽發的駕駛執照的人士，在符合指定條件下，可無須通過本地駕駛考試而獲直接簽發香港正式駕駛執照，以駕駛私家車、輕型貨車、電單車及／或機動三輪車。

根據《規例》，在申請「免試簽發」時，有關認可國家或地方簽發的駕駛執照必須仍然有效或有效期屆滿不超過三年，以及是申請人在簽發國家或地方經成功完成有關的駕駛考試後而獲得的。此外，申請人必須年滿十八歲，並符合以下其中一項條件：（1）持有的駕駛執照是申請人在簽發國家或地方居住不少於六個月的期間發出；或（2）在緊接申請前申請人已持有該認可國家或地方的駕駛執照不少於五年；或（3）申請人持有該駕駛執照簽發國家或地方的護照或同等的旅行證件。

就林順潮議員的問題各部分，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）至（三）為便利市民，如同其他牌證申請服務，運輸署接受「免試簽發」申請人按需要選擇親身或委託代理人（包括家人、朋友等）遞交申請及證明文件。為符合《規例》下就「免試簽發」的資格要求，不論是申請人或其代理人均須在遞交申請時提供多項真實及準確的相關證明文件正本（包括認可國家或地方發出的有效駕駛執照、申請人護照／其他旅遊證件、居住證明或駕駛執照細節證明書等證明文件），供運輸署職員即場審核。運輸署一直以嚴謹的方式處理申請，確保每份獲批的申請均屬正確。

現時，「免試簽發」申請人可經網上預約或在牌照事務處領取即日籌以使用櫃位服務，遞交申請文件。有關領取即日籌方面，為維持輪候秩序，運輸署已進一步派員加強巡查，並增設圍欄分隔輪候「免試簽發」籌號及其他一般駕駛執照服務籌號的人士，和劃分指定輪候位置。此外，就「免試簽發」，該署會指明輪候籌號次序，以防止插隊等情況。運輸署一直有張貼告示，及派職員及保安人員在場提供適切協助。如發現有影響公共秩序的行為，會交由警務處跟進。

為加強核對取籌人士身分，運輸署已提升即日籌的派籌系統，確保使用同一身分證明文件的人士在每一個時段只可取一籌。櫃位人員會嚴格核對使用者的身分證明文件號碼，確保取籌人士與櫃位服務使用者為同一人，以阻截籌號轉讓。如發現有違規轉讓，所有相關籌號即告無效，申請概不受理。

為針對有部分人士在領取即日籌後兜售代辦服務，運輸署將於二○二五年八月中起再進一步優化派籌系統。屆時，所有取籌人士於輸入其個人身分證明文件號碼之餘，亦須同時輸入「免試簽發」申請者的身分證明文件號碼，而有關資料會列印於籌號上。使用櫃位服務時，櫃位職員將核對該籌號的持有人及申請人的身分證明文件號碼。如任何身分證明文件號碼與籌號上列印的不符，該籌號即告無效，有關申請亦不獲受理。有關優化安排可遏止任何人在取籌後憑籌號兜攬生意。運輸署會於網頁公布有關派籌輪候系統的最新運作安排，並會透過社交媒體公布有關信息。運輸署人員會在場張貼告示，並會安排向在場的市民提供協助。

（四）運輸署一直非常關注輪候取籌及網上預約的情況，並採取針對性的優化措施。除上述關於即日籌的優化安排外，在網上預約方面，運輸署將加強與有關駕駛執照簽發機構的合作，例如由二○二五年九月起查核經網上預約提供的內地駕駛證的申請人資料，如發現資料不真確，有關網上預約將會被取消，名額會重新開放予其他申請人預約。有關措施可確保提升系統有效運作。

運輸署會持續檢視上述優化措施的成效，適時調整相關安排，並繼續推動牌證服務電子化，從而調動更多櫃位辦理如「免試簽發」等必須經櫃位處理的申請。"
LCQ15: Off-school STEAM courses,2025-07-23 11:00,2025-07-23 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300277.htm,"âFollowing is a question by Professor the Hon William Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

It is learnt that many parents have enrolled their children in STEAM (i.e. ‍Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) courses conducted outside of school, hoping to cultivate their children's interest in these relevant disciplines. However, there are views pointing out that, in order to increase enrolment within the same class sessions, certain course providers overlook the differences in learning abilities among students of varying ages and employ identical teaching materials for pupils from Primary One to Primary Six. Such practices call into question the effectiveness of teaching and learning. Furthermore, it has been reported that, in recent days, a three-year-old child participating in a STEAM interest class at an external organisation sustained scald injuries from hot milk in the course of an experiment. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of requests for assistance or complaints received by the authorities regarding off-school STEAM courses/interest classes over the past three years; the main subject matters of such requests and complaints, and the specific follow-up measures taken by the authorities;

(2) whether the authorities will formulate a safety management protocol for off-school STEAM courses by drawing reference from guidelines such as the Safety Handbook for Primary Science and the Handbook on Safety in Science Laboratories; if so, of the specific standards of such a protocol and the timetable for its implementation; if not, whether the authorities will expeditiously commence a study to enhance the safety standards for off-school STEAM courses so as to prevent further accidents; and

(3) whether the authorities have finalised an accreditation system for teachers, teaching materials and curricula to be established for off-school STEAM courses, and delineated the appropriate age ranges for students to participate in such courses; if so, of the specific accreditation standards and the implementation timetable; if not, whether the authorities will expeditiously commence a study to establish an accreditation system for off-school STEAM courses, with a view to assisting parents in choosing suitable courses for their children?

Reply:

President,

According to sections 3(1) and 10 of the Education Ordinance, any institution, organisation or establishment which provides for 20 or more persons during any one day or 8 or more persons at any one time, any nursery, kindergarten, primary, secondary or post secondary education or any other educational course by any means is required to be registered or provisionally registered as a school. Private schools which offer educational courses such as tutorial, commercial, computer, language courses and courses for repeaters are all categorised as private schools offering non-formal curriculum (PSNFCs). Subject to compliance with specified conditions under the Education (Exemption) Private Schools Offering Non-formal Curriculum) Order, PSNFCs are exempt from certain requirements of the provisions of Education Ordinance and Education Regulations relating to fees, employment of teachers and teachers' qualifications, principals, holidays and hours of instruction.

In response to Professor the Hon William Wong's questions, the reply is as follows:

(1) In the past three years, the Education Bureau (EDB) has not received any requests for assistance or complaints relating to participation in off-school STEAM courses provided by schools other than those offering formal curriculum.

(2) and (3) The Safety Handbook for Primary Science and Handbook on Safety in Science Laboratories, issued by the EDB, provide references and guidelines for safety matters of Primary Science and secondary science laboratories respectively. They assist schools, when arranging science learning activities and experiments, in aspects such as safety management, risk assessment, equipment storage, etc, so as to ensure the safety of teachers and students. In addition to schools implementing the Primary Science curriculum and secondary science subject curricula, other registered schools offering non-local/non-formal curricula may also refer to these guidelines.

PSNFCs mainly provide tutorial services to students receiving formal school education, which constitute an optional rather than mandatory service. For this type of school, the main role of the EDB is to ensure its compliance with the requirements on school premises safety, hygiene, accommodation, teachers' qualifications, and collection of fees under the Education Ordinance. In this connection, the EDB has no intention to set up a certification system for the STEAM courses offered by these PSNFCs.

It should be noted that all schools are responsible for ensuring compliance with relevant ordinances and regulations when arranging science activities and experiments, including the Education Regulations (particularly regulations 21, 24, 26, 27, 31, 32 and 33), the Education Ordinance, the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, and regulations related to dangerous goods and disposal of chemical waste."

根據《教育條例》第3（1）及第10條，任何院校、組織或機構，只要其於任何一天向20人或多於20人或於任何時間同時向八人或多於八人提供幼兒、幼稚園、小學、中學或專上教育或以任何方式提供任何其他教育課程，即須註冊或臨時註冊為學校。所有開辦補習班、商科、電腦、語文課程及重讀生課程等教育課程的私立學校，均屬於提供非正規課程的私立學校。而提供非正規課程的私立學校只要符合《教育（豁免）（提供非正規課程的私立學校）令》中所指明的條件，便可豁免於《教育條例》及《教育規例》中有關費用、僱用教員及教員資格、校長、假期及授課時間等條文的管限。

就黃錦輝議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年，教育局並沒有接獲有關接受提供正規課程學校以外的校外STEAM課程的求助或投訴個案。

（二）及（三）教育局編訂的《小學科學科安全手冊》和《科學實驗室安全手冊》，分別為小學科學科和中學科學實驗室的安全事宜提供參考和指引，協助學校在安排科學學習活動及實驗時，於安全管理、風險評估、器材存放等方面有所依循，以保障師生安全。除推行小學科學科及中學各科學科目課程的學校，其他提供非本地課程／非正規課程的註冊學校亦可參考這些指引文件。

非正規課程的私立學校多為接受正規學校教育的學生提供私營補習服務， 而這只是一種可供選擇而非絕對需要的服務。對於這類學校，教育局的工作重點是確保這些學校符合《教育條例》有關校舍安全、衞生、學生容額、師資及收費等方面的規定。因此，教育局並無意為這些非正規課程的私立學校所舉辦的STEAM課程設立認證制度。

惟須注意，所有學校在安排科學實驗活動時，均有責任確保遵行相關條例及規例，包括《教育規例》（尤其是第21、24、26、27、31、32及33條）、《教育條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》，以及有關危險品和化學廢物處置的規例。"

According to the investigation, the unauthorised party had cyberattacked the system by making countless attempts at the mid-night of July 20 and the following day to access and retrieve information through the address book function of EC-Ship system. Hongkong Post had activated the blocking mechanism immediately after the abnormal activities being detected by its system and disabled the operation of the EC-Ship account which was involved in the cyberattacks at once. During the above-mentioned blockage and interception of these cyberattacks, the concerned accounts' address books information, including the senders' and recipients' person/company names, addresses, and/or phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses, was being accessed and retrieved.

Hongkong Post has sent emails to inform all affected account holders today and reminded them to remain vigilant, and to immediately inform relevant persons of their address books about this incident and remind them to be vigilant. The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) has initiated investigation into the incident and Hongkong Post will fully cooperate with the HKPF in the investigation, and will closely monitor the situation of the involved information.

Hongkong Post has been following established Government procedures on information and cybersecurity. The Digital Policy Office (DPO) is also in close communication with Hongkong Post on the incident, noting that it has taken immediate actions by promptly blocking the cyberattacks and enhancing the security measures of the system. The services concerned have resumed normal and account holders involved can continue to use the services.

The spokesman for Hongkong Post said that the global cybersecurity landscape was evolving, with various forms of cyberattacks emerging continuously. Hongkong Post would actively seek advice from the DPO to continuously enhance the cyber resilience level and cybersecurity risk management, to safeguard the information security of users and to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

Hongkong Post reiterates that it will not send embedded hyperlinks via emails, SMS messages or social media pages for collecting personal information or requesting for payment. Hongkong Post wishes to alert members of the public again to refrain from clicking on any embedded links or providing any personal or financial information such as credit card information, or making any payment to suspicious emails or SMS messages alleged to be sent by Hongkong Post.

僱主／承建商及僱員須注意在暴雨下工作時的電力安全,2025-07-22 20:01,2025-07-22 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200797.htm,"鑑於天文台已發出暴雨警告，勞工處提醒僱主及承建商，當僱員在進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置時，須採取所需的工作安排及適當安全措施，以保障僱員的工作安全。

勞工處發言人今日（七月二十二日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

如有任何有關職業安全及健康的問題，可致電2559 2297，與勞工處職業安全主任聯絡。"
"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-07-22 20:01,2025-07-22 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200798.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (July 22) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

CHP investigates case of severe paediatric enterovirus infection,2025-07-22 19:45,2025-07-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200765.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (July 22) investigating a case of severe paediatric enterovirus (EV) infection, and reminded the public to observe good hand, personal and environmental hygiene.

 The case involves a 5-year-old girl with good past health. She developed fever, headache and vomiting on July 18 and sought medical attention from a private doctor on the following day. On July 21, she was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital and was admitted for treatment. She remains hospitalised.

 A laboratory test of her cerebrospinal fluid specimen was positive for EV. The clinical diagnosis was meningitis.

 Preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the patient had travelled to the Mainland with four travel collaterals during the incubation period. One of her travel collaterals developed a cough and runny nose on July 18 and sought medical attention from a private doctor, while the other travel collaterals remained asymptomatic. Her household contacts have remained asymptomatic for the time being. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

 EV infection is transmitted by direct contact with the nasal and throat secretions of an infected person. Children with EV infection should stay at home until they have recovered to avoid infecting other children. The public should be vigilant and observe the following preventive measures:


Wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet and changing diapers;
Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing;
Maintain good indoor ventilation; and
Thoroughly clean toys or appliances contaminated by nasal or oral secretions.

"Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao collaborate to prevent and control mosquito-borne disease, Chikungunya fever",2025-07-22 19:45,2025-07-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200757.htm,"In response to recent cases of Chikungunya fever (CF) recorded in Foshan of Guangdong and Macao, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 22) said that Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been carrying out joint prevention and control of communicable disease involving the three places in accordance with the well-established liaison and communication mechanism. The CHP will continue to work closely with the health authorities in Guangdong Province and Macao, and will take appropriate preventive and control measures according to risk assessment to prevent the spread of CF in Hong Kong and protect public health.

Collaboration of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao on disease prevention and control

""Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been working closely in communicable disease prevention and control, emergency response, and the co-operation mechanism for disease prevention and control. Owing to the communicable disease notification mechanism established by the three places, the CHP has kept abreast of the latest situation of CF in Guangdong Province. Although no confirmed CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong so far this year, the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer is expected to aggravate mosquito infestation in Hong Kong. Additionally, people travel more frequently during summer holidays, including to regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Consequently, there is an increased risk of imported cases and local transmission of mosquito-borne diseases, such as CF and dengue fever. Members of the public are advised to take precautionary and personal protection measures against mosquitoes, both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Measures to cope with risk of importation of mosquito-borne disease

Dr Tsui added that, in order to cope with the risk of imported case of mosquito-borne disease, the CHP's Port Health Division has stepped up inspections at the boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. The Port Health Division also conducts temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever will be assessed on health conditions and referred to hospitals for follow up when necessary. The CHP will also maintain close liaison with relevant stakeholders, such as airlines and the travel industry, to provide the latest disease information and health advice in a timely manner.

In addition, the CHP has issued a letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel. If CF cases are detected, they should be immediately referred to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism, so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures.

In view of the recent outbreak of CF in neighbouring areas, the Hospital Authority (HA) has reminded healthcare professionals to be vigilant in early identification of patients for timely diagnosis and management of patients. Its hospitals and clinics have also been reminded to step up mosquito control measures to prevent mosquito breeding. The CHP will continue to work closely and maintain communication with the HA to make timely response. Once a suspected case is detected, the HA will activate the surveillance and notification mechanism and report the case to the CHP immediately.

The DH will continue to step up health education on mosquito-borne diseases, including disseminating travel health advice to travellers and enhancing public education on the prevention of CF through various online and offline channels. The interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee will convene a meeting tomorrow (July 23) to review the latest situation of mosquito proliferation and the anti-mosquito work of departments, and to plan for the anti- mosquito work for the future.

Information on CF

The symptoms of CF are similar to those of dengue fever. Patients with CF typically presented with fever and joint pain. Other common symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. While most patients recover on their own, in some cases, joint pain may persist for several months or even years. The mortality rate of CF is generally lower than that of dengue fever. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year. All of which were imported cases. There have been no CF cases in Hong Kong since 2020.

According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of early June this year, over 220 000 cases had been reported in 14 countries/regions worldwide (including the Mainland, Taiwan and Singapore which are popular tourist destinations for Hong Kong citizens). Of these cases, about 80 were fatal.

According to the announcement of the Foshan Municipal Health Bureau, as of July 20, there were 2 285 CF confirmed cases in Foshan. The majority of cases (2 158 cases) were in Shunde District, primarily in Lecong, Beijiao and Chencun towns; 69 cases in Chancheng District, primarily in Shiwan Town, Zumiao and Zhangcha Street; and 58 cases in Nanhai District, primarily in Guicheng Street. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases so far. Regarding Macao, the first CF case this year was recorded on July 18. The patient travelled to Shunde during the incubation period and was classified as an imported case."

By listing in Hong Kong, companies can tap into overseas markets and accelerate their global expansion. The event attracted over 110 corporate representatives to participate and received enthusiastic feedback. Participants learned about Hong Kong's unique advantages in supporting global business expansion and expressed strong interest in future opportunities.
  
  Prominent leaders from professional service organisations and corporates, including the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), Deloitte China, and China International Capital Corporation Limited, spoke at the seminar. They provided in-depth insights into Hong Kong's listing process and competitive advantages, discussed financial and tax planning strategies, and explored post-listing international business development opportunities. Representatives from Mainland enterprises already listed in Hong Kong also shared their success stories. They highlighted how they have successfully leveraged Hong Kong's unique advantages to go public and scale into global markets.
  
  In his welcome remarks, Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Arnold Lau said, ""As an international financial centre, Hong Kong is having the strong support of the country while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle. In the first half of 2025, IPO fundraising in Hong Kong exceeded $107 billion, ranking first globally. Notably, consumer goods, retail, and services accounted for 34 per cent of Main Board listings, reflecting strong market vitality. Over the past two and a half years, Invest Hong Kong has supported more than 1 300 companies in establishing a presence in Hong Kong, bringing in over $160 billion in investment, a clear reflection of international enterprises’ confidence in and recognition of Hong Kong’s business environment. This year marks the 25th anniversary of both Invest Hong Kong and the HKEX. We will continue to work closely together to support enterprises from listing to global expansion, contributing to the nation's dual circulation strategy.""
  
  Vice President, Global Issuer Services of the HKEX, Ms Maria Yuan, provided an introduction of Hong Kong's listing regulations, processes and policies, mapping the route for companies to list in Hong Kong.
  
  During the panel discussion, the Capital Market Services Group (HK) Leader, Southern Region of Deloitte China, Mr Robert Lui, said, ""Hong Kong's mature capital market, stable valuations, and ample liquidity, combined with its simple, low-tax regime, are favourable factors for businesses to build competitive financial and tax structures. For Mainland F&B companies, listing in Hong Kong not only helps boost brand visibility but also leverages the city's pivotal roles as both a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder', accelerating overseas expansion."""

The two clusters involved seven males and one female aged between 23 and 25, who developed abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting, about four to 36 hours after having meals at Deluxe King Japanese Restaurant at 9/F, CTMA Centre, 1 Sai Yeung Choi Street, Mong Kok, on July 10 and 19 respectively.

  Of those affected, two persons sought medical advice. None of them required hospitalisation.

A preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the affected persons had consumed common food, including sashimi and raw oysters. Upon notification, staff of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) had conducted joint investigation with staff of the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the CHP on the same day (July 21) at the restaurant, examined the handling process and food hygiene, and collected food and environmental samples for testing.

The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to suspend serving the incriminated food items with immediate effect and carry out cleaning and disinfection of the premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises.

The investigation of the CHP and CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;

粵港澳三地聯防聯控　加強防控蚊傳疾病基孔肯雅熱,2025-07-22 19:00,2025-07-22 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200734.htm,"就廣東佛山及澳門近期先後錄得基孔肯雅熱個案，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十二日）表示，粵港澳三地一直按照行之有效的聯絡溝通機制，對涉及三地的傳染病進行聯防聯控工作。中心會繼續和廣東省、澳門的衞生當局保持緊密聯繫，按照風險評估採取適當的防控措施，預防基孔肯雅熱在本港傳播，保障市民健康。

粵港澳三地聯防聯控

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「粵港澳三地在傳染病防控、緊急應變及聯防聯控等方面一直合作無間。中心根據三地建立的傳染病通報機制，充分掌握廣東省近日基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。雖然本港今年暫時未錄得基孔肯雅熱的確診個案，但隨着夏季氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況預料會加劇，加上市民在暑假期間會較頻繁外遊，包括前往蚊傳疾病流行的地區，因此出現蚊傳疾病（如基孔肯雅熱、登革熱）輸入個案及本地傳播的風險增加。因此，市民不論在本地或外遊時，都應時刻做好防蚊控蚊及個人保護措施。」

為應對蚊傳疾病輸入風險的措施

徐樂堅醫生補充，為應對蚊傳疾病輸入的風險，中心港口衞生科已在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒旅客進行健康評估及在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。中心亦會與航空公司和旅遊業界等持份者保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議。

此外，中心已去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。

醫院管理局（醫管局）鑑於鄰近地區近期出現基孔肯雅熱爆發情況，已提醒醫護人員提高警覺，及早識別患者，以便適時診斷和治理病人，並已提醒醫院及診所加強控蚊措施，防止蚊蟲滋生。醫管局會繼續與中心緊密合作和保持溝通，作出適時應變。一旦發現疑似病例，醫管局會啓動監察及通報機制，即時向中心通報個案。

衞生署會繼續加強蚊傳疾病的健康教育工作，包括向旅客發布旅遊健康建議，並會透過線上及線下的不同渠道加強關於預防基孔肯雅熱的公眾教育。政府跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會將於明日（七月二十三日）召開會議，檢視蚊患最新情況及各部門的防治蚊患工作，並部署未來的防蚊工作。

基孔肯雅熱的資訊

基孔肯雅熱的病徵與登革熱相似，病人通常會出現發燒和關節痛。其他常見病徵包括肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、疲倦和紅疹。大部分病人可以自行痊癒，但個別病人的關節痛會持續數月甚至數年。基孔肯雅熱的死亡率一般較登革熱為低。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為外地傳入個案，由二○二○年至今，沒有錄得確診基孔肯雅熱的個案。

世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱個案。截至今年六月初，全球14個國家／地區共錄得超過22萬宗個案（包括內地、台灣、新加坡等香港人的旅遊熱點），當中約80宗為死亡個案。

根據佛山市衞生健康局公布，截至七月二十日，當地錄得2 285宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，絕大部分（2 158宗）出現在順德區，主要集中在樂從鎮、北滘鎮和陳村鎮；另外禪城區有69宗，主要集中在石灣鎮、祖廟和張槎街道；南海區亦有58宗，主要集中在桂城街道。所有患者症狀輕微，暫時沒有錄得嚴重或死亡個案。澳門方面，當局在七月十八日錄得當地今年首宗基孔肯雅熱個案，患者於潛伏期到過順德，被列為輸入個案。"

One local man and one non-local man were arrested.

Acting upon intelligence, Customs officers earlier targeted a 37-year-old local man and a 50-year-old non-local man and initiated a financial investigation. It was revealed that the duo smuggled cash out of Hong Kong, and conducted stablecoin and fiat currency transactions with a doubtful fund source at a frequent and fast pace, which was highly incommensurate with their background and financial status. They were suspected of participating in money laundering activities.

Following in-depth investigations, Customs officers this morning raided four residential premises and two companies and seized a batch of items suspected to be connected with the case, including mobile phones, tablets and bank cards. The two men, who claimed to be self-employed and unemployed respectively, were arrested for ""dealing with property known or reasonably believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offence"" (commonly known as money laundering) under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO).

An investigation is ongoing. The two arrested persons have been released on bail pending further investigation. The likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

Under OSCO, a person commits an offence if he or she deals with any property knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that such property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and imprisonment for 14 years while the crime proceeds are also subject to confiscation.

Members of the public may report any suspected money laundering activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."

The Task Force announced in November last year a series of specific proposals for elderly-friendly building design and consulted the stakeholders. Stakeholders from the elderly, professional, developer and other sectors generally supported the proposals and provided valuable suggestions for refining the design proposals.

Having considered the views of the stakeholders, the Task Force has refined the proposals announced earlier after balancing various factors, including the needs of the elderly and other users, as well as the practical operational considerations in application by the market and the industry. The key requirements of the proposals to be implemented are as follows:

(1) promoting spatial accessibility to enhance the mobility of the elderly, e.g. provision of an automatic door at the main entrance of residential buildings, adopting wider common corridors and wider main doors of individual units, allowing the addition of lift towers to existing buildings, and using slip-resistant materials;
(2) encouraging the adoption of adaptive design in residential units to facilitate subsequent modifications, such as widening internal corridors and doors, using sliding doors for toilets, and installing grab rails/shower seats in bathrooms, etc;
(3) enhancing elderly well-being, e.g. providing fitness or other facilities for the elderly in recreational spaces, and providing shelters for resting facilities at communal outdoor spaces, etc; and
(4) facilitating the adoption of gerontechnology and Internet of Things, e.g. providing high-speed Internet access in home and public spaces, supporting the installation of smart card systems, motion sensors, etc.

âPlease refer to the summary table at the Annex for the detailed proposals.

Apart from new private residential buildings, composite buildings and commercial premises often patronised by the elderly (e.g. shopping complexes and clinics, etc), the above proposals are also applicable to alterations and additions to existing buildings of these building types. As for public housing developments and government buildings, the Government will also endeavor to adhere to the proposals. The proposals comprise both encouraged features and mandatory requirements, and the proposals will be implemented in two phases. For the encouraged features (including promoted features through incentives and the recommended best practices), the Buildings Department (BD) has administratively updated the practice notes and the ""Design Manual: Barrier Free Access"" for implementation. As for the mandatory design requirements, the Government will implement them through amendments to the Building (Planning) Regulations in the first half of 2026.

In addition, to encourage and facilitate the industry to adopt the recommended best practices for elderly-friendly building design, the DEVB, in collaboration with the HKGBC and the BSL, has launched the Elderly-friendly Building accreditation scheme. The scheme is voluntary and applicable to both new and existing buildings. Buildings that have adopted the specified recommended best practices, as assessed by the BSL, are eligible for the Elderly-friendly Building certification issued by the HKGBC. To promote participation in the accreditation scheme, the Elderly-friendly Building certification can be one of the ""specific standards"" for granting gross floor area (GFA) concessions by the BD (Note). In addition, the accreditation scheme also dovetails with the work of the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration to promote the development of the silver economy.

The accreditation scheme is open for application from today. Please visit the website (www.beamsociety.org.hk/en/BEAM-Plus/BEAM-Plus-Theme-Certification) for details and to apply (beamplusadmin.my.salesforce-sites.com/), or call 3610 5700 to enquire about the details of the scheme from the BSL.

A Government spokesman said, ""After more than a year's effort, the Task Force on Promoting Elderly-friendly Building Design has formulated the final proposals and accomplished its mission. The Government is grateful to stakeholders for their support in promoting elderly-friendly building design and looks forward to facilitating and encouraging the industry to actively incorporate elderly-friendly building design elements into their buildings according to their own circumstances through various means to support ageing in place and make Hong Kong a livable city recognised by the silver hair market.""

Note: Starting from June 30, 2024, building projects are normally required to attain the ""Anticipated Gold"" rating in the BEAM Plus in order to be eligible for GFA concessions for green/amenity features. If a project can only achieve the ""Anticipated Silver"" or ""Anticipated Bronze"" rating, it has to demonstrate compliance with one or more of the specific standards stipulated by the BD in order to be eligible for GFA concessions. Currently, the specific standards include (a) enhanced greening provision; (b) health and well-being; (c) enhanced natural ventilation; (d) adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in plan submissions; and (e) adoption of multi-trade integrated mechanical, electrical and plumbing in building services (MiMEP)."
SCS encourages Administrative Service summer interns (with photos),2025-07-22 18:26,2025-07-22 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200523.htm,"  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, met and shared experiences with over 50 tertiary students participating in the Administrative Service Summer Internship Programme today (July 22). She encouraged them to apply for civil service positions such as the Administrative Officer (AO) post, and to use their professional knowledge to serve the community, benefit people's livelihood and contribute to the development of Hong Kong.

  This year, the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) has arranged for the interns to discuss and submit policy proposals in various areas including transport, planning and development, social enterprises, district affairs, the silver economy, etc, based on their observations and insights gained after working in different bureaux or departments. The CSB will submit these proposals to the bureaux or departments where the interns were assigned to for their reference.

  At the gathering, Mrs Yeung listened to the sharing by interns on both their work experiences and proposed policy initiatives during their internships. Drawing on her nearly 40 years of service in the civil service, she shared valuable insights as an AO and encouraged students to actively enrich themselves, plan ahead for their future and contribute to the development of the country and Hong Kong.

  She said, ""I am aware that this round of the Programme has received a record number of applications, attracting more than 300 applications from tertiarystudents in Hong Kong, mainland China and overseas. From your sharing, I can genuinely feel your passion for public service. I would like to take this opportunity to call on young people who are dedicated to serve the community and willing to take on responsibilities to join the civil service.

  ""I look forward to interns becoming AOs in the near future, serving the public and contributing to the country and Hong Kong with your own strengths and talents.""

  The Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Clement Leung, and Deputy Secretary for the Civil Service Ms Eureka Cheung also joined the sharing session and spoke with interns to learn about their internship experiences and views on Hong Kong's development.

  AOs are professional public administrators who play a pivotal role in the Government. They are responsible for assisting in the formulation of government policies, co-ordinating and supervising various initiatives, managing the use of public resources, promoting district work and publicising Hong Kong externally, etc. To enable AOs to accumulate experience and unleash their full potential in different public policy areas, they are posted to various bureaux and departments at regular intervals, broadening their horizons and gaining a fuller grasp of the challenges and opportunities in public administration.

  The CSB organises the Administrative Service Internship Programme every summer and winter, offering students who aspire to become AOs opportunities to work alongside serving AOs for around eight weeks to gain early practical experiences in public service and lay a solid foundation for their future career development. Statistics from the past five years show that around one in every five newly recruited AOs had participated in the Programme.

  The Government will launch a new round of recruitment for the posts of Administrative Officer, Executive Officer II, Assistant Labour Officer II, Assistant Trade Officer II and Management Services Officer II in September this year. Prospective applicants must first take the Common Recruitment Examination (CRE) and the Basic Law and National Security Law Test to attain the requisite scores. The new round of the CRE is currently open for application. Interested candidates are required to apply online by August 1.

公務員事務局今年安排實習生在不同決策局或部門工作後，按他們所見所聞所想，在多個範疇包括交通、規劃發展、社企、地區事務、銀髮經濟等，分組討論和提交政策倡議，公務員事務局會把這些建議交到派駐實習的決策局或部門供他們參考。

楊何蓓茵於聚會中聆聽實習生分享他們實習期間的工作點滴和政策倡議，並以自己近40年公務員生涯的經歷，分享作為政務主任的寶貴心得，勉勵學生積極充實自己、規劃未來，為國家及香港的發展作貢獻。

她說：「我知道今輪實習計劃接獲的報名人數創新高，吸引了本地、內地以至海外超過300名大專生報名申請。從大家的分享中，我感受到大家對公共服務的熱誠。我希望藉此呼籲有志服務社會、敢於承擔的年輕人積極考慮加入公務員行列。」

「我期待參與實習的同學們在不久將來成為政務主任，以自身所長，服務市民，貢獻國家和香港。」

公務員事務局常任秘書長梁卓文及副秘書長張誼亦特別到場與實習生傾談，聆聽他們分享實習生活和對香港發展的意見。

政務主任是專業的公共行政管理人員，在政府中擔任重要角色，負責協助制定公共政策、統籌和督導各項施政措施、管理公共資源的運用，並推動地區工作及對外宣傳香港等。為讓政務主任在不同公共政策領域中累積經驗、發揮潛能，政務主任會定期調派至各決策局和政府部門工作，擴闊視野，更全面掌握公共行政的各項挑戰與機遇。

公務員事務局每年夏季及冬季均會舉辦政務職系實習計劃，讓有志成為政務主任的學生，有機會與現職政務主任共事約八星期，提早汲取在政府工作的實際經驗，為未來事業發展奠定基礎。過去五年的統計顯示，每五名新入職的政務主任中，其中一人便曾參加政務職系實習計劃。

政府將於今年九月展開新一輪招聘政務主任、二級行政主任、二級助理勞工事務主任、二級助理貿易主任及二級管理參議主任的工作。有意應徵該等職位的人士，須先應考綜合招聘考試及「基本法及香港國安法測試」，以取得所需成績。其中，新一輪綜合招聘考試現正接受申請，有意投考者須於八月一日或之前於網上報名。詳情請參閱公務員事務局網頁（www.csb.gov.hk/tc_chi/index.html）。"

政府公布落實長者友善樓宇設計和推出「長者友善樓宇」認證計劃,2025-07-22 17:38,2025-07-22 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200588.htm,"​政府今日（七月二十二日）公布，由財政司副司長黃偉綸領導的「推動長者友善樓宇設計」工作組已完成制訂長者友善樓宇設計的方案，由今年中起分批落實。同時，發展局與香港綠色建築議會及建築環保評估協會合作，推出自願性「長者友善樓宇」認證計劃，鼓勵業界採用長者友善樓宇設計的建議作業範例。

隨着香港人口高齡化，為鼓勵居家安老，《行政長官2023年施政報告》宣布，由財政司副司長統籌相關政策局，制定有關推動長者友善樓宇設計的建議。工作組於去年十一月公布一系列長者友善樓宇設計的具體建議，並諮詢持份者。來自安老、發展專業和發展商等界別的持份者普遍支持建議，並就優化設計建議提出寶貴意見。

經考慮持份者的意見後，工作組在平衡各方面因素，包括長者和其他使用者的需要，以及市場和業界的實際應用考慮後，就早前公布的建議作出了微調，將落實的方案主要內容如下：

（一）促進空間通達性，提高長者的行動能力，例如在住宅樓宇正門提供自動門、採用較寬闊的公用走廊和住宅單位大門、容許於現有建築物加建升降機塔、使用防滑物料等；
​（二）鼓勵住宅單位採用靈活彈性的設計，方便將來改裝，例如加闊室內走廊和門、採用趟門洗手間、浴室內裝設扶手╱淋浴座椅等；
​（三）提升長者幸福感，例如在休憩空間為長者提供健身或其他設施、在戶外公用地方設置休憩設施的遮蓋等；以及
​（四）便利採用樂齡科技和物聯網，例如在家居和公共地方提供高速的互聯網服務，支援安裝智慧卡系統、活動感應器等。

方案詳情可參閱載於附件的一覽表。

上述方案除適用於新建的私人住宅樓宇、商住樓宇和長者經常出入的商業處所（例如商場及診所等）外，亦適用於這些類別的現存樓宇的改建及加建工程。至於公營房屋和政府建築物，政府也會致力按方案行事。方案包含鼓勵性設計元素和強制性規定，將分兩階段實施建議。就鼓勵性設計元素（包括透過誘因推廣的設計元素和建議作業範例）方面，屋宇署已以行政方式更新作業備考及《設計手冊：暢通無阻的通道》予以實施。至於強制性設計規定方面，政府會於二○二六年上半年透過修訂《建築物（規劃）規例》實施。

此外，為鼓勵和推動業界採用長者友善樓宇設計的建議作業範例，發展局與香港綠色建築議會和建築環保評估協會合作，推出「長者友善樓宇」認證計劃。計劃屬自願性質，適用於新建和現存樓宇，若申請樓宇能採用指定的建議作業範例，經由建築環保評估協會評估後，便可獲得由香港綠色建築議會頒發的「長者友善樓宇」認證。為推廣參與認證計劃，有關「長者友善樓宇」認證亦可作為屋宇署批予總樓面面積寬免的其中一項「特定標準」（註）。此外，認證計劃亦與政務司副司長領導的促進銀髮經濟工作組的工作相輔相成，以促進銀髮經濟發展。

認證計劃今日起接受申請，可瀏覽網頁（www.beamsociety.org.hk/zh-HK/beam-plus/beam-plus-theme-certification）了解詳情及申請（beamplusadmin.my.salesforce-sites.com/），亦可致電36105700向建築環保評估協會查詢計劃詳情。

政府發言人表示：「經過一年多的努力，『推動長者友善樓宇設計』工作組已制訂最終方案並完成任務。政府感謝持份者對推動長者友善樓宇設計的支持，並期望通過不同方式，促使及鼓勵業界按其實際情況，積極把長者友善樓宇設計元素融入構築物中，支援居家安老，讓香港成為銀髮一族公認的宜居城巿。」

尊敬的劉懋洲一級巡視員（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室（中聯辦）教育科技部一級巡視員）、蔡冠深會長（香港中華總商會會長）、李慧琼議員（憲法和基本法推廣督導委員會愛國主義教育工作小組組長、立法會議員）、沈鳳君常任秘書長（文化體育及旅遊局常任秘書長）、各位嘉賓、各位青年朋友：

大家好！今天很高興來到香港科學館，參與「少年太空人體驗營2025」的出發儀式，同各位一齊見證30位中學生成為新一屆「少年太空人」，即將前往內地認識國家在航天科技的驕人成就。

自二○○九年起，康樂及文化事務署聯同香港中華總商會舉辦「少年太空人體驗營」，並得到總商會的全力贊助。多年來，這個活動讓接近400名學生到訪國家的航天基地，親身了解國家航天科技的高度發展，更有機會與航天專家和航天員見面學習。

如往年一樣，今年體驗營的選拔過程競爭激烈，有超過80間學校、約120位同學報名參加。今日在座的30位同學均是經過三輪嚴格選拔，才能夠脫穎而出成為「少年太空人」。我希望大家好好珍惜國家為你們提供的這個寶貴的、極難得的機會。這個體驗營不僅是你們對航天體驗的開始，更是開啓你們夢想旅程的第一步。

國家航天事業的飛躍發展，令人振奮。去年，中國科學院、國家航天局、中國載人航天工程辦公室聯合發布了《國家空間科學中長期發展規劃（2024—2050年）》，當中提出在二○三六至二○五○年，中國空間科學重要領域將達到世界領先水平。單在今年，國家在這個領域已有不同突破：今年四月恰逢第十個中國航天日及神舟二十號載人飛船成功發射；天問二號探測器自五月底升空，正前往一顆小行星進行探測與採樣任務；以及國家自主研發的大型民航客機C919，已在年初開通來往香港和上海的定期航班。這些都是國家航天科技人才努力不懈開創出來的成果。

近年香港的科研團隊在國家的支持下，積極參與國家的太空探索任務，例如：去年六月，香港特區首次有市民獲選為預備航天員，成為國家載人航天工程的載荷專家；以及香港理工大學的科研團隊為嫦娥四號、五號和六號的探月任務，進行研發和提供了技術支援，當中包括與中國空間技術研究院合作，研製了「表取採樣執行裝置」，協助嫦娥六號完成人類史上首次月球背面表土採樣任務。香港能為國家航天任務貢獻自身力量，實在是我們的榮幸；同時亦激勵我們要繼續做好航天創科教育，培育科研人才，把香港建設成為具影響力的國際創科中心。

在這裏，我想向大家劇透一下：八月一日，在我們身處的科學館將會舉行一個介紹國家航天、航空及航海領域科技成就的專題展覽。市民可以見證到國家憑着創新精神和攻堅壯志，在這些領域如何攀上世界領先地位。

最後，我衷心感謝香港中華總商會、中國載人航天工程辦公室、中聯辦及京港學術交流中心，對「少年太空人體驗營」的鼎力支持。我希望各位「少年太空人」把握這個彌足珍貴的受訓機會，親身感受國家航天事業的輝煌成就，以航天英雄為榜樣，將來成為推動國家航天事業發展的寶貴力量。多謝大家。"
金融管理專員對三三金融服務有限公司違反《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》採取紀律處分行動,2025-07-22 17:07,2025-07-22 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200330.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月二十二日）宣布，已根據《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（香港法例第584章）（《支付條例》）完成對三三金融服務有限公司（三三金融）的調查及紀律處分程序。金融管理專員對三三金融違反《支付條例》第8Q條，未能符合其附表3第2部第6（2）（b）條的最低準則，處以譴責及1,600,000港元罰款。

是次紀律處分行動（註一）是根據金管局的調查結果而作出。調查發現三三金融在二○一九年十二月一日至二○二三年八月三十一日期間未有制定健全及適當的管控制度，以遵守《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》（儲值支付工具持牌人適用）（《指引》）的有關段落（註二）。

是次違規涉及三三金融的管控制度在以下三個範疇的缺失：


索取足夠資料以了解與客戶建立業務關係的目的，及其預期性質；
對個人客戶所代表的法團進行客戶盡職審查措施；以及
確保三三金融的業務合作夥伴，作為其外判實體，按照其內部要求對客戶妥善進行身份識別和核實，以及作出紀錄。


在決定上述的紀律處分行動時，金融管理專員已考慮有關情況及因素，包括：


調查結果的嚴重性，以及三三金融過往已有與《支付條例》相關的紀律處分紀錄；
需要向業界傳遞明確的阻嚇訊息，以表明有效管控措施及程序在應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險方面的重要性；
三三金融在得悉金管局所指出的缺失後已採取補救措施，並加強其管控制度；以及
三三金融以合作態度解決金管局的關注事項。


金管局助理總裁（法規及打擊清洗黑錢）陳景宏表示：「客戶盡職審查措施對打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集尤其重要。核實客戶身份和了解業務關係的目的及其預期性質，為客戶盡職審查措施的重要元素，而儲值支付工具持牌人應確保已建立有效的相關措施。」

Monetary Authority takes disciplinary action against 33 Financial Services Limited for contravention of Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance,2025-07-22 17:07,2025-07-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200331.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 22) that it had completed an investigation and disciplinary proceedings for 33 Financial Services Limited (33FS) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Chapter 584 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (PSSVFO). The Monetary Authority (MA) has reprimanded and ordered 33FS to pay a pecuniary penalty of HK$1,600,000 for contravening section 8Q of the PSSVFO as it failed to fulfil the minimum criterion under section 6(2)(b) of Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the PSSVFO.

The disciplinary action (Note 1) follows an investigation by the HKMA which found that, during the period from December 1, 2019 to August 31, 2023, 33FS failed to have in place adequate and appropriate systems of control to comply with the relevant paragraphs of the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (For Stored Value Facility (SVF) Licensees) (Guideline) (Note 2).

Specifically, the contravention relates to deficiencies in 33FS' systems of control in three areas, namely:


obtaining sufficient information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationships with customers;
carrying out customer due diligence (CDD) measures on the business entities of which the individual customers acted on behalf; and
ensuring the identification and verification of identity of customers was properly performed and documented by its business partners, which were acting as outsourced entities for 33FS, in accordance with its internal requirement.


  In deciding the disciplinary action, the MA has taken into account the relevant circumstances and factors, including:


the seriousness of the investigation findings as well as the fact that 33FS has previous disciplinary record in respect of the PSSVFO;
the need to send a clear deterrent message to the industry about the importance of effective controls and procedures to address money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks;
33FS has taken remedial measures to address the deficiencies identified by the HKMA and enhance its systems of control; and
33FS is co-operative in resolving concerns identified by the HKMA.


  The Executive Director (Enforcement and AML) of the HKMA, Mr Raymond Chan,said, ""CDD measures are crucial for combatting ML and TF risks. Verifying the identity of customers and understanding the purpose and intended nature of the business relationships are essential elements of CDD measures. SVF licensees should ensure that they have effective CDD measures in place.""

Note 1: The disciplinary action is taken under section 33Q of the PSSVFO.

Note 2: Paragraphs 4.6.1, 4.1.3(a), 4.1.3(d), 4.4.4, and 4.3.16 of the Guideline (October 2018 version and September 2020 version)."
​金融管理專員對三家銀行違反《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》採取紀律處分行動,2025-07-22 17:05,2025-07-22 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200317.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月二十二日）宣布，已根據《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》（香港法例第615章）（《打擊洗錢條例》）完成對三家銀行的調查及紀律處分程序。三家銀行分別為Indian Overseas Bank, Hong Kong Branch（IOBHK）、交通銀行（香港）有限公司（交銀（香港））及交通銀行股份有限公司香港分行（交銀香港分行）。

金融管理專員：（i）譴責IOBHK；（ii）命令IOBHK就過往的交易進行回顧檢討，以及制定並落實補救措施，以糾正其違反事項；及（iii）對IOBHK處以8,500,000港元罰款。此外，金融管理專員對交銀（香港）處以4,000,000港元罰款和對交銀香港分行處以3,700,000港元罰款。金融管理專員對上述三家銀行所採取的紀律處分行動之詳情載於隨附各自的紀律處分行動聲明。

是次紀律處分行動（註）是金管局對上述銀行就《打擊洗錢條例》所設立的制度及管控措施的合規情況進行調查後而作出的。調查發現三家銀行未有設立及維持有效措施以持續監察與客戶的業務關係。

IOBHK的交易監察機制和管理層對打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施的監察存在重大缺失。

交銀（香港）及交銀香港分行的違反事項源於兩家銀行未有將某些類別的交易載入至兩家銀行共用的交易監察系統，削弱了該系統識別可疑活動的效用。

在決定上述紀律處分行動時，金融管理專員已考慮有關情況及因素，包括：


調查結果的嚴重性；
需要向上述三家銀行及業界傳遞明確的阻嚇訊息，以表明有效的管控措施及程序在應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險方面的重要性；
有關銀行已就發現的缺失採取補救措施（如適用）；及
上述三家銀行過往並無與《打擊洗錢條例》相關的紀律處分紀錄，並在金管局的調查及執法程序中表現合作。


金管局助理總裁（法規及打擊清洗黑錢）陳景宏表示：「有效的交易監察措施讓銀行能及時識別和舉報可疑交易，因此是銀行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施中的重要一環。銀行管理層應確保銀行備有妥善的交易監察系統及流程，並在發現缺失時迅速糾正。」

Monetary Authority takes disciplinary actions against three banks for contraventions of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance,2025-07-22 17:05,2025-07-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200318.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 22) that it had completed investigations and disciplinary proceedings under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Chapter 615 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (AMLO) in relation to three banks: Indian Overseas Bank, Hong Kong Branch (IOBHK), Bank of Communications (Hong Kong) Limited (BCOM(HK)) and Bank of Communications Co., Ltd., Hong Kong Branch (BCOM Hong Kong Branch).

The Monetary Authority (MA) has: (i) reprimanded IOBHK; (ii) ordered IOBHK to conduct a look-back review of past transactions, and develop and implement a remedial plan to address the contraventions; and (iii) imposed a pecuniary penalty of HK$8,500,000 on IOBHK. Separately, the MA has imposed pecuniary penalties of HK$4,000,000 on BCOM(HK) and HK$3,700,000 on BCOM Hong Kong Branch. Details of the disciplinary actions against each of the three banks are set out in the respective Statements of Disciplinary Action attached.

The disciplinary actions (Note) follow investigations by the HKMA into the banks' systems and controls for compliance with the AMLO. The control deficiencies identified related to failures to establish and maintain effective procedures for continuously monitoring business relationships with customers.

There were significant deficiencies in IOBHK's transaction monitoring mechanism and management oversight of the bank's anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls.

The contraventions of BCOM(HK) and BCOM Hong Kong Branch arose from omissions to load certain types of transactions into the transaction monitoring system shared by the two banks, undermining the system's effectiveness in identifying potentially suspicious activities.

In deciding the disciplinary actions, the MA has taken into account the relevant circumstances and factors, including:


the seriousness of the investigation findings;
the need to send a clear deterrent message to the three banks and the industry about the importance of having effective controls and procedures to address money laundering and terrorist financing risks;
where applicable, the remedial measures taken by the banks to address the deficiencies identified; and
the three banks have no previous disciplinary record in relation to the AMLO and co-operated with the HKMA during the investigations and enforcement proceedings.


The Executive Director (Enforcement and AML) of the HKMA, Mr Raymond Chan,said, ""Effective transaction monitoring enables timely identification and reporting of suspicious transactions and thus is an essential component of banks' AML/CFT controls. Bank management should ensure that proper transaction monitoring systems and processes are in place and any identified deficiencies are addressed promptly.""

Name: Ten Respiratory Pathogens Antigen Test Kit
Supplier: SAVEWO Distribution Limited
Manufacturer: Anhui Deepblue Medical Technology Co., Ltd
Model number: RP1011N-1
Lot numbers: 20250301 and 20250501

According to information provided by the supplier in Hong Kong, the product in question is an all-in-one test for 10 types of respiratory pathogens, including influenza, COVID-19 and H5N1 avian influenza. It has been distributed in the local retail market since March this year. Following internal testing, the manufacturer has updated the IFU to state that if the H5N1 detection zone is positive but the FIuA+B/COV detection zone is negative, the H5N1 avian influenza test result is invalid.

The supplier has uploaded the updated IFU to its official website. Members of the public who have purchased the affected batch of products are advised to contact the supplierat 5503 2370 if they have any queries regarding their RAT test results.

The product concerned is a Class C (moderate-high risk) In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device and is not listed under the DH's Medical Device Administrative Control System (MDACS).

The DH reminded members of the public that all RATs have limitations, including the possibility of false negative or false positive results. Therefore, RAT test results can only be used for reference purposes and cannot replace the professional diagnosis by doctors. Members of the public should consult healthcare professionals if they have doubts about the results of RATs.

Separately, the DH has introduced a voluntary MDACS, under which a listing system for medical devices and traders, as well as a post-market monitoring system, is in place to ensure that medical devices supplied in Hong Kong meet the safety, quality and performance requirements. Information on listed medical devices is uploaded to the website of the DH's Medical Device Division (www.mdd.gov.hk/en/mdacs/search-database/list-md/index.html). The DH advised members of the public to purchase medical devices listed under the MDACS wherever possible to ensure that the products meet the standards on safety, quality and performance.
