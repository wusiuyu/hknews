各位市民、各位傳媒朋友，大家好。

行政長官剛發表了現屆政府第四份《施政報告》，主題為「深化改革、心繫民生、發揮優勢、同創未來」。

香港當前正處於經濟轉型的關鍵時期，新一份《施政報告》圍繞發展經濟、改善民生兩大主軸，短、中、長期政策並舉，為加快社會和經濟發展、改善市民生活，提出了清晰的目標和落實的藍圖，並致力推動香港更好融入國家發展大局，發揮深化國際交往合作的作用。

北部都會區是引領香港未來發展的引擎、是創科產業的重要載體，也是與大灣區兄弟城市合作的重要基地。當前，北都的基本規劃已經出台，現在正是引入產業和重大項目的關鍵期，以加速香港創科產業的生態構建和發展。

《施政報告》提出成立由行政長官親身領導的北都發展委員會，加上在開發模式、建造技術和設備，以至批撥土地方式等靈活和前瞻性措施，拆牆鬆綁，加快推動北都發展。我們會全力以赴，務求讓北都的基建、交通、社區建設與產業發展相互配合，加快提升經濟發展動能，讓發展成果早日惠及市民。

產業發展和革新，是《施政報告》的另一重點。香港必須積極培育新興產業，而引進企業和人才對達到這個目標至關重要，過去幾年香港在這兩方面也取得了不錯的進展。今年《施政報告》在這方面也提出了新思路和新舉措，包括制訂促進招商的政策包，並增加靈活性，讓我們更有條件吸引全球各地的企業落戶，與本港國際金融中心、創科中心和人才樞紐的優勢更好結合，進一步引領人工智能、生物科技、醫療醫藥等產業的跨越式發展。

此外，在傳統優勢產業方面，《施政報告》也提出了新的發展維度，例如在金融方面，建立香港黃金中央清算系統；在貿易方面，設立大宗商品策略委員會，加強相關發展的政策統籌。

今年以來，在國家的堅實支持下，香港經濟穩中有進，從國際資金的流入、企業和人才的落戶，到各項國際排名的躍升，香港在「一國兩制」下的優勢正在加速顯現。行政長官新一份《施政報告》，以深化改革帶動發展，以心繫民生領航施政，我們會全力支持行政長官，落實好各項政策措施，一同為香港開創更美好的未來。"

《施政報告》：深化改革　心繫民生　發揮優勢　同創未來,2025-09-17 14:46,2025-09-17 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/17/P2025091700550.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（九月十七日）發表任內第四份《施政報告》，題為「深化改革心繫民生發揮優勢同創未來」，圍繞經濟和民生兩大主軸，提出一系列措施，為民生福祉發展經濟，讓市民過更好的生活。

李家超說：「今年是國家『十四五』規劃的收官之年，亦是『十五五』規劃的謀篇布局之年。這份《施政報告》既是香港全力『拼經濟謀發展惠民生』、加快邁向『由治及興』的進程表，亦是香港主動對接國家發展戰略、實現突破新局面的策略部署。」

「改善民生是我施政的最終目標，讓市民有更好住房、打工仔有更多收入、長者有更好照顧、青年有更好發展。民生與經濟息息相關，經濟增長是改善民生的基礎，能創造就業和財富，為公共服務提供更多資源，讓政府提供更多服務；民生改善則帶動社會需求，激發市場活力，促進經濟發展。經濟與民生，兩者相輔相成。」

強化治理體系

為提升部門整體管理水平，強化部門首長的責任擔當，《施政報告》提出建立部門首長責任制，把制訂和執行政策兩者的責任更好銜接起來，推動建立有效的管理團隊與運作系統；出現問題時查找不足、釐清責任，並按情況進行行政或紀律處理。公務員敍用委員會的職能將會擴大，就嚴重或涉及廣泛或重複性的系統問題，或涉及部門首長的角色，進行獨立調查；而公務員事務局亦會研究建立更嚴謹的公務員表現評核機制。

人工智能（AI）應用在政府工作可有效提升效能，政府將成立AI效能提升組，統籌和指導政府部門於工作中有效應用AI技術，研究重組工作流程，以及推動部門進行科技革新。

深化改革發展產業

為加快發展北部都會區（北都），將會成立由行政長官領導的北都發展委員會，提升決策層次。政府會簡化行政措施，拆牆鬆綁，並會訂立「加快發展北都」專屬法例，授權政府為提速北都發展制訂簡化法定程序。

產業是經濟發展的基石。財政司司長會帶領相關政策局、部門及公營機構，制訂促進產業和投資的優惠政策包，涵蓋批地、地價、資助或稅務減免優惠等，吸引高增值產業和高潛力企業落戶香港，推動高質量發展。

政府會引進和發展飛機回收、新能源產業等新型工業化產業；並會推動生命健康科技產業發展，成立香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心及引進創新藥物及醫療器械辦公室，助力藥企將創新藥推向市場。政府亦會推動AI和數據科學產業發展，拓展AI在公務和商務上的應用。

香港擁有1 180 公里海岸線和263個島嶼，有優勢成為亞洲遊艇樞紐。就此，政府將優化遊艇產業配套，增加遊艇泊位和優化訪港遊艇入境流程等，以推廣高端遊艇旅遊，發展遊艇經濟。

融入國家發展大局鞏固香港國際中心地位

《施政報告》提出整合香港的外地辦事處，組成一站式平台，成立內地企業出海專班，主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台「出海」。相關政策局、部門和機構會為「出海」企業制訂多元方案。

在金融方面，政府會加速建立國際黃金交易市場，措施包括推動更多機構在港拓展黃金倉儲，以三年內超越2 000噸為目標，建造區域黃金儲備樞紐；推動金商在港建立或擴建精煉廠；建立香港黃金中央清算系統；豐富黃金投資工具等。

在貿易方面，政府將繼續推動發展香港大宗商品交易生態圈，會成立大宗商品策略委員會，加強大宗商品政策的頂層設計和長遠策略制訂；利用金融創新優化國際大宗商品交易流程；以及深化與廣州期貨交易所及內地其他大宗商品市場的聯通發展。

未來幾年，香港預料將成為全球規模最大的跨境財富管理中心。政府會優化新資本投資者入境計劃，放寬申請人在港投資要求，以吸引更多投資者。

為發展香港成為國際教育樞紐與國際高端人才集聚高地，政府會建設北都大學城，並會成立留學香港專班，推廣「留學香港」品牌。

香港是全球三大藝術品交易中心之一。政府會大力打造香港成為全球高端藝術品交易樞紐，措施包括構建機場城市藝術生態圈；與巴塞爾藝術展深化合作；以及與業界就藝術品交易的稅務、融資、人才等範疇進行研究。

安居生活關愛共融

今年《施政報告》以民生為壓軸專章，在土地房屋、交通運輸、醫療護理、社會福利、保障勞工、關愛共融等九個與市民生活息息相關的重要範疇，提出一系列改善市民生活的措施。

保障市民基本的住屋需求是施政的首要任務。在居屋供應顯著增加的基礎上，政府會將綠白表配額比例調升，協助更多公屋租戶變成業主。其他豐富置業階梯的措施包括提升居屋和綠置居面積較大單位的比例，增加白居二計劃配額，放寬新出售單位的轉讓限制年期，推出香港房屋委員會資助出售單位「長者業主樓換樓計劃」等。

在醫療方面，政府會強化基層醫療服務，包括擴展醫管局家庭醫學門診、推出慢性疾病共同治理平台，又會透過一籃子措施促進精神健康。

支持本地經濟方面，為更佳應對經濟轉型，政府會推出11項措施，加大支援中小企，包括寬減收費、額外預留300億元加大工程項目開支及進一步加快審批食肆露天座位的申請等。為推廣寵物友善，政府將推出容許狗隻進入的食肆牌照，寵物餐廳可為業界帶來全新商機。

為應對社會高齡化挑戰，政府會設立社會高齡化對策工作組，制訂涵蓋安老、醫療、房屋、文化康樂、樂齡科技及進一步推動銀髮經濟發展等的對策。

鼓勵生育方面，政府進一步推出「組合拳」措施，包括延長初生子女可享額外免稅額至出生後首兩年，以及未來三年將新增15所資助幼兒中心，提供共約1 500個零至三歲兒童日間照顧名額。

李家超總結時說：「世界在變，香港同時面對挑戰和機遇。祖國是世界第二大經濟體，是香港最強大後盾，最龐大機遇；香港同時享有國際機遇的疊加優勢，機遇明顯大於挑戰。只要我們團結一致，改革創新，自強不息，我們的共同家園香港必定更美好，東方之珠必定更耀目光芒。」

各位香港市民，各位傳媒朋友，大家好。

行政長官剛剛發表了《2025年施政報告》，以「深化改革心繫民生發揮優勢同創未來」為主題。

這份《施政報告》立足國家發展大局，主動對接國家發展戰略，落實中央對香港的指導方針，充分展現香港在「一國兩制」下的獨特優勢，以更廣視野、更大格局為香港的未來勾劃清晰而堅實的發展藍圖。

今年的《施政報告》圍繞經濟和民生兩大主軸，以更大決心推動改革、追求進步，透過制度創新和政策突破，進一步鞏固和提升香港的國際競爭力，為經濟發展注入新動能、創造新機遇。

與此同時，這份《施政報告》亦充分展現由行政長官領導的本屆政府，始終貫徹「以民為本」的施政理念。報告提出多項惠民措施，涵蓋房屋、交通、醫療、勞工、扶貧、安老等不同方面，切實回應社會訴求，改善民生，讓市民分享發展成果，共同建設更宜居、更溫暖的香港。

我認為今年的《施政報告》，至少有以下五大範疇，值得大家重點關注。

第一，是加快發展北部都會區的專章。香港正處於轉型升級的關鍵時刻，而北部都會區正正是我們未來經濟發展和科技創新的重要引擎。《施政報告》提出透過簡化行政措施，拆牆鬆綁，以新思維加快審批、開發及建設，並為北部都會區發展訂立專項法例，全面推動市場參與，加速發展。行政長官親自領導北都發展委員會，提升決策層次，並下設三個分別由我、財政司司長和財政司副司長任組長的工作組，強化整體督導、統籌和協調。

第二，是推動人工智能產業發展。科技發展一日千里，而人工智能是當前科技革命的核心。《施政報告》公布一系列有關進一步推動人工智能和數據科學發展的措施，並加大力度培育本地及吸引國際和內地AI人才。行政長官亦宣布成立AI效能提升組，推動政府部門進行科技革新，重組工作流程，並在工作中有效應用AI技術，進一步提升政府效能。

第三，是進一步強化治理體系。《施政報告》提出強化部門首長的責任擔當，建立部門首長責任制，將訂定和執行政策兩者的責任更好銜接，重點在於破除瓶頸、補齊短板，提升部門效能，並在出現問題時查找不足、釐清責任，按情況進行行政或紀律處理，全面提升政府部門的整體管治水平和效能。

第四，是國際教育樞紐的建設。香港擁有享譽國際的大學教研資源，吸引全球優秀人才來港升學和研究。《施政報告》進一步推出一系列措施，包括放寬自資收生上限、增加學生宿舍供應、招攬更多國際教研人才和學生等，致力將香港打造成國際專上教育樞紐和國際高端人才集聚高地。

第五，是全面構建關愛共融社會。改善民生、提升市民的幸福感和獲得感，一直是本屆政府施政的重中之重。《施政報告》透過豐富置業階梯、強化基層醫療、加強勞工支援和保障等不同措施，為社會謀福祉，全力改善民生；並繼續貫徹「精準扶貧」策略，強化「共創明『Teen』計劃」、增設六間社區客廳等，將資源精準投放到最有需要幫助的群體。

《施政報告》亦針對產業發展、鞏固國際中心地位、創新科技、文體旅協同發展、鼓勵生育等多方面提出一系列短、中、長期措施，為香港未來發展奠下堅實基礎。

總括來說，這份《施政報告》既致力推動經濟邁向更高質量發展，也全力改善民生福祉，為香港的長遠繁榮和市民幸福提出了清晰的路徑和具體的行動方案。而政府更會積極協助本地傳媒發展香港以外的網絡，大家一起說好「香港故事」。

我會繼續全力支持和協助行政長官施政，積極督導、統籌和協調各政策局和部門，以堅定的決心、務實的態度，確保各項政策措施得到全面而有效的落實；同時凝聚團結全社會的力量，同心協力讓市民安居樂業、讓社會更關愛融和，讓香港的未來更光明美好。

多謝大家。"

張國鈞博士表示，這次行程正好呼應剛公布的《行政長官2025年施政報告》的措施之一，即由他專責推廣香港法律服務，協同其他專業服務如會計、金融等，支援內企出海需要。

他指，論壇由中國國際貿易促進委員會、廣西壯族自治區人民政府，以及東盟（東南亞國家聯盟）十國國家工商會共同主辦，匯聚來自國內及東盟國家三百多名的法律界、工商界人士、法律科技企業代表及學者，而律政司亦獲邀出席。此行有助促進桂港優勢互補，為兩地法律服務開闢發展空間，為內企出海增添力量。

在南寧期間，張國鈞博士亦會在廣西律師協會及中國—東盟博覽會秘書處舉辦的2025面向東盟律師涉外實務交流會上致辭，推廣香港法律服務在國際商貿及區域合作中發揮的獨持優勢。他並會與廣西壯族自治區司法廳領導，以及來自廣西及東盟各國的律師及企業代表會面，加強合作。

設立「社會高齡化對策工作組」

265. 政府致力構建長者友善的樂齡社會。去年《施政報告》提出成立的「促進銀髮經濟工作組」（工作組）已於5月公布30項措施。政府會聯同香港工業總會制訂「銀色Q嘜」，以及與業界進一步研究就銀色產品制訂更多大灣區標準，便利業界為長者提供更多選擇。

266. 高齡化是全球問題，2046年香港65歲以上人口將佔整體的36%。為應對社會高齡化挑戰，政府會成立「社會高齡化對策工作組」，由政務司副司長帶領各政策局制訂對策，除了涵蓋安老、醫療、房屋、文化康樂、樂齡科技等，亦會考慮推動銀髮經濟進一步發展，並會諮詢安老事務委員會，在明年提交報告。

推動婦女發展

267. 我們會將「婦女自強基金」的年度撥款由每年2,000萬元增至3,000萬元，資助婦女團體及非政府機構推行更多推動婦女發展項目。政府明年亦會舉辦第二屆「香港家庭暨婦女發展高峰會」。

鼓勵生育

268. 本屆政府改變以往政府「不干預」生育政策，於2023年推出「組合拳」鼓勵生育，推出不同稅務優惠，包括居所按揭利息或租金額外扣稅額、輔助生育醫療開支扣稅額、提升子女的基本免稅額及出生年度增加額外免稅額。亦推出各項支援措施，包括推出可縮短輪候時間一年的公屋「家有初生優先配屋計劃」、居屋「家有初生優先選樓計劃」、增加額外幼兒照顧服務名額、擴展學前兒童課餘託管服務至全港18區、增加政府醫療輔助生育服務名額，以及推出2萬元的新生嬰兒獎勵金等。

269. 截至8月底，超過5 300宗公屋申請在「家有初生優先配屋計劃」下獲縮減一年輪候時間；剛剛於8月完成選樓的居屋銷售計劃中，有超過800個有初生子女的家庭透過「家有初生優先選樓計劃」購入單位。

270. 新生嬰兒數目自2017年起連續六年下跌，但2023和2024年出現了不跌反升的現象，而2024年更有顯著新生嬰兒增幅，按年多約3 500名，增加約11%，共36 700名。

271. 我們會進一步推出「組合拳」措施鼓勵生育，包括：

(i) 延長初生子女可享額外免稅額的時間，由一年增至兩年。由2026/27課稅年度起，在每名子女出生後首兩年，納稅人可就該名子女享有雙倍免稅額（即26萬元）。措施適用於該課稅年度末所有未滿兩歲的子女。

(ii) 進一步加強日間嬰幼兒照顧，未來三年將新增15所資助幼兒中心，合共提供約1 500個零至三歲的兒童日間照顧服務名額，比現時規模增加近一倍。社署亦會適當地把較多的服務名額撥作照顧零至兩歲的嬰幼兒。

(iii) 在校課後託管服務方面，我們會在本學年擴充「在校課後託管服務計劃」，名額不再設上限，方便家長外出工作。

(iv) 為方便孕婦輪候醫療服務，設立關愛窗口。基層醫療署並會聯同香港家庭計劃指導會、衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院及醫管局婦產科，提升婦女在孕前、產前和產後的健康教育和服務，提供實用資訊。

(v) 支援輔助生育方面，人類生殖科技管理局已修訂法例，今年12月生效，取消供自用的配子和胚胎的法定儲存期限，為有意生育人士提供更大靈活性。醫管局會繼續增加輔助生育服務名額，2025-26年度會由兩年前的1 100個增至1 500個。

(vi) 推廣家庭友善，會繼續透過《好僱主約章》²⁸鼓勵更多僱主參與，及實施有利育兒的家庭友善僱傭措施，如彈性工作時間。

兒童保護及支援學童

凝聚家庭守護兒童

272. 政府會在北都古洞北新發展區設立一間綜合家庭服務中心，支援區內家庭及兒童。我們會協助及教育離異父母，協商共同肩負照顧子女的持續責任；亦會為離開兒童住宿照顧服務而缺乏家庭支援的青少年提供過渡性支援。

273. 為配合《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》的實施，政府已推出《強制舉報者指南》，協助強制舉報者掌握保護兒童的原則，並會繼續為社福界、教育界及醫療衞生界的指明專業人員提供培訓及相關資源。教育局亦會加強推廣正向家長教育。

增強特殊需要兒童支援

274. 政府會為接受「到校學前康復服務」的特殊需要兒童，在升讀小學後的第一個學期提供銜接和支援服務。

支援少數族裔

275. 少數族裔是香港大家庭的重要部分，政府一直致力為少數族裔在學習中文、日常生活、社區融合等多方面提供支援。

加強支援少數族裔融入社區

276. 民政總署會在服務北區及離島區的支援服務中心各增設一支少數族裔關愛隊，同時於全港十間少數族裔人士支援服務中心設立「青年網絡」和「婦女網絡」，推行更多專為少數族裔青年及婦女而設的活動；並在今年12月增設一間少數族裔傳譯及翻譯服務中心，亦會持續加強宣傳種族共融的訊息和電台節目。醫務衞生局會推進試行計劃，為少數族裔人士提供情緒支援及輔導服務中心。

少數族裔就業

277. 我們會繼續推行為少數族裔專上學生而設的政府部門實習計劃，並提供職場中文基礎培訓。政府部門可按需要設計以工作為導向的語文能力測試，為申請人提供多一個途徑達到語文能力入職要求。我們亦會持續向少數族裔發放政府招聘訊息，吸引不同背景的人才加入公務員團隊。

支援非華語學生

278. 我們會於2026/27學年把專為非華語學生設計的「漢語水平考試」學習材料，由高小推展至初中，亦會持續籌辦課後中文學習班和組織跨校教師學習社群。

持續優化關愛隊服務

279. 18區關愛隊將開展第二期服務，我們按地區需要新增了三支「關愛隊」小隊，並優化了第二期服務的關鍵績效指標。為了讓關愛隊持續提升服務，政府根據去年《施政報告》增加資助金額五成，同時給予這些義務關愛隊更多行政支援，包括聘用行政人員。在應急支援方面，我們亦會加強培訓，讓關愛隊持續與政府部門、公共事業機構及地區組織有更多聯繫和合作。

改善大廈管理

280. 民政總署會推進多項改善大廈管理的措施，包括在各區議會下設立工作小組交流經驗；按「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃的成效推廣至其他地區；檢視《建築物管理條例》等。

281. 我們將優化處理樓宇滲水問題的檢測程序，利用科技加快確定滲水情況及責任誰屬，要求業主在指定時間內自行檢查和糾正，否則政府會採取進一步行動並向其收回費用，促使業主履行妥善保養物業的責任，並積極推動以調解方式解決住戶之間的爭議。我們亦會在舊式樓宇引入「物聯網火警偵測系統」替代傳統的消防裝置及設備。

第十章結語

282. 今天的香港，站在邁向「由治及興」的關鍵節點，我們正處於經濟轉型期，這過程逆轉不了，轉型是邁向經濟更強大的必經過程。

283. 過去香港經歷過多次經濟轉型。從賣大光燈發達的大笪地時代，到商場成行成市取代了大笪地，大光燈不再大賣；由工廠林立搶女工，到廠家紛紛北上，開創一片新天地；從每人都買一部隨身BB傳呼機，到每人改買手機再難看到BB機店鋪，每次轉型迎來的都是經濟更強大、收入更多。

284. 這些轉型背後，承載着無數香港人拼搏奮鬥的故事，靠的是改革變通、自強不息。這些是香港人的特質，香港成功的DNA。

285. 我們不能自滿，也不應妄自菲薄。過去三年，在政府和市民的共同努力下，香港不斷闖高峰。香港的金融中心地位上升一位，穩居世界第三；整體競爭力連續兩年上升共四位至世界第三；人才競爭力共上升12位至世界第四；香港公司註冊數目創歷史新高；境外進駐香港的公司亦創歷史新高；家庭收入中位數上升11%，增加3,000元。這些客觀評級和數字，反映香港經濟前景光明和國際的信心，也彰顯了香港在「一國兩制」下長期繁榮穩定的強大生命力。

286. 世界在變，香港同時面對挑戰和機遇。祖國是世界第二大經濟體，是香港最強大後盾，最龐大機遇；香港同時享有國際機遇的疊加優勢，機遇明顯大於挑戰。只要我們團結一致，改革創新，自強不息，我們的共同家園香港必定更美好，東方之珠必定更耀目光芒。

Establish a Working Group on Ageing Society Strategies

265. The Government is committed to building an elderly-friendly society. Established following the last Policy Address, the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy announced 30 measures in May. The Government will collaborate with the Federation of Hong Kong Industries to formulate the ""Silver Q-Mark"", and with the trade to consider setting additional GBA Standards for silver products to facilitate the provision of more options for the elderly.

266. Ageing is a global issue. By 2046, people aged 65 and above will account for 36% of our total population. To tackle challenges of an ageing society, the Government will set up a Working Group on Ageing Society Strategies under the steer of the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration to co-ordinate the efforts of various bureaux in formulating the relevant strategy responses. Aside from covering areas such as elderly care, healthcare, housing, culture and leisure, and gerontechnology, the working group will consider promoting the further development of silver economy. The working group will take into account the views of the Elderly Commission, and submit a report next year.

Promote Women's Development

267. We will increase the annual funding of the Women Empowerment Fund from $20 million to $30 million to subsidise women's organisations and NGOs launching projects that promote women's development. The Government will also host the second Family and Women Development Summit Hong Kong next year.
Promote Fertility

268. On childbirth policy, the current-term Government has shifted from the non-interventionist approach adopted by the Government of the previous terms to the multi-pronged policy approach launched in 2023 to promote fertility. We have introduced various tax concessions, including raising the tax deduction ceiling for home loan interest or domestic rents, introducing a new tax deduction for the medical expenses of assisted reproductive services, and increasing the basic child allowance and additional child allowance in the year of birth. We have also implemented various support measures, including launching the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme to shorten the waiting time by one year for PRH applicants with newborns, introducing the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme, providing additional places for child care services, extending the After School Care Programme for Pre-primary Children to all 18 districts in Hong Kong, and introducing the Newborn Baby Bonus of $20,000.

269. At the end of August, more than 5 300 PRH applications had their waiting time reduced by one year under the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme. In the recent HOS sale exercise with flat selection concluded in August, over 800 families with newborns purchased their flats under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme.

270. The number of newborn babies has decreased for six consecutive years since 2017, but there was an upward trend in 2023 and 2024. In 2024, there was a significant increase in the number of newborns, a year-on-year increase of about 3 500 babies, or about 11%, adding up to 36 700 babies born in total.

271. We will implement further measures under the multi-pronged policy approach to promote fertility. They include:

(i) Extend the claim period of additional child allowance for newborns from one year to two years. Starting from the year of assessment 2026/27, a taxpayer may claim twice the allowance (i.e. $260,000) for each child in the first two years following childbirth. This measure is applicable to all children under the age of two by the end of the year of assessment.

(ii) Further enhance infant and child day care service. Fifteen new aided child care centres (CCCs) will be set up over the next three years to provide about 1 500 day care service places for children between birth and three years old, almost doubling the existing supply. The SWD will also allocate more care-service places for infants and toddlers from birth to two years, as appropriate.

(iii) Enhance the School-based After School Care Service Scheme within this school year by removing the cap on the number of places to make it easier for parents to take up jobs.

(iv) Set up dedicated counters for pregnant women to facilitate their waiting for medical services. The PHC Commission will, together with the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong, the MCHCs under the DH, as well as the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Departments of the HA, enhance health education and services for women during pre-pregnancy, as well as antenatal and postnatal stages, providing them with practical information.

(v) Support assisted reproductive services. The Council on Human Reproductive Technology has made amendments to the legislation, removing the statutory storage periods of gametes and embryos for own use, offering greater flexibility to people who wish to give birth. The amendments will take effect from this December. Moreover, the HA will continue to increase the service quota for assisted reproductive service from 1 100 treatment cycles two years ago to 1 500 treatment cycles in 2025-26.

(vi) Foster a family-friendly culture. We will continue to encourage more employers, through the Good Employer Charter²âµ, to adopt family-friendly employment practices that are conducive to childcare, such as flexible working hours.

Protect Children and Provide Support for Students

Strengthen Family Cohesion and Safeguard Children

272. The Government will set up an Integrated Family Service Centre in Kwu Tung North NDA in the Northern Metropolis, to support families and children in the area. In addition, we will support and educate divorced/separated parents to collaborate in shouldering continuous and joint parental responsibilities in raising their children. We will also offer transitional support to young people who no longer receive residential child-care services but lack family support.

273. To complement the implementation of the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance, the Government has promulgated the Guide for Mandated Reporters to assist mandated reporters in mastering child protection principles, and will continue to provide training and relevant resources for specified professionals from the social welfare, education and healthcare sectors. The EDB will also step up promotion of positive parenting education.

Enhance Support for Children with Special Needs

274. For children with special needs receiving On-site Pre-school Rehabilitation Services, the Government will provide bridging and support services during their first term in primary school.

Provide Support for Ethnic Minorities

275. Ethnic minorities (EMs) are important members of the Hong Kong community. The Government has been striving to support EMs on various fronts, including Chinese-language learning, daily living and community integration.

Strengthen Support for Ethnic Minorities' Integration into the Community

276. The HAD will set up one additional EM Care Team under the Support Service Centres, serving the North and Islands Districts respectively. The department will also establish a Youth Network and a Women's Network at the 10 Support Service Centres for EMs to organise activities specifically for EM youth and women. Moreover, the Government will set up an additional Interpretation and Translation Service Centre for EMs in December. We will also strengthen the promotion of messages and radio programmes related to racial integration. In addition, the Health Bureau will also take forward the pilot project of providing emotional support and counselling services for EMs through a service centre.

Employment of Ethnic Minorities

277. We will continue to implement the government department internship programme for EM post-secondary students and will provide basic workplace Chinese training. Government departments may design their own job-oriented language tests to provide an additional channel for applicants to meet language-proficiency appointments. We will also disseminate government recruitment information to EMs on an ongoing basis, to attract talents from different backgrounds to join the civil service.

Provide Support for Non-Chinese Speaking Students

278. The Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi Chinese Proficiency Test learning materials, tailored for non-Chinese speaking students, will be extended from the upper primary level to the junior secondary level in the 2026/27 school year. We will also continue to provide after-school Chinese language courses and organise cross-school, teacher-learning communities.

Continuously Enhance Care Team Services

279. Care Teams across 18 districts will soon begin their second term of service. Having regard to district needs, we have set up three additional Care Teams and revised the KPIs for the second term of service. To enable Care Teams to continuously enhance their services, the Government has increased the subsidy by 50%, in accordance with last year's Policy Address, and provided these voluntary Care Teams with additional administrative support, including hiring administrative staff. As for emergency support, we will enhance training so that Care Teams can continue to strengthen ties with government departments, public utilities and district organisations.

Improve Building Management

280. To improve building management, the HAD will implement a number of measures, including establishing working groups under DCs to share experience; expanding the Pilot Scheme on Joint Property Management to other districts based on its effectiveness; and reviewing the Building Management Ordinance.

281. We will enhance the inspection and testing procedures for handling water seepage problems by utilising technology to expedite the identification of the seepage situation and delineate the responsibility, requiring owners to inspect and rectify within a specified time, or else the Government will take further action and recover costs from owners. This will prompt owners to fulfil their obligations in properly maintaining their properties. We will also actively promote mediation to resolve disputes between residents. An Internet of Things fire detection system will also be introduced in old buildings to replace traditional fire service installations and equipment.

Chapter X Closing Remarks

282. Today, Hong Kong is at the critical juncture of advancing from stability to prosperity. We are moving through an irreversible economic transition, but it is an essential process for a stronger and more robust economy in the future.

283. Over the decades, Hong Kong has undergone multiple economic transitions. Once, the bustling Sheung Wan night market (the ""Dai-tat-dei"") sold paraffin lamps that were a big business until modern malls made them unnecessary. Bustling factories that once competed for female labour have since relocated their production lines to the Mainland, opening new horizons for the manufacturers. Pagers, once a common sight in every hand, have been replaced by smartphones, leaving behind empty pager shops as relics of a past era. Each change brought about a stronger economy and higher income for the people.

284. These transformations were possible because generations of Hong Kong people have worked hard, stayed flexible, and never given up. That grit is part of our DNA, and it will continue to be the engine that drives us forward.

285. We must not be complacent, nor should we underestimate our own capabilities. In the last three years, Hong Kong has climbed higher thanks to the teamwork of the Government and the community. We have risen one spot to become the world's third-largest international financial centre, and our overall competitiveness has jumped four places to also rank third globally. In talent competitiveness, we have leapt twelve spots, now sitting at fourth in the world. The number of registered local companies has hit a record high, as has the number of non-local companies setting up operations in Hong Kong. The median household income has also grown by 11%, an increase of $3,000. These numbers tell a clear story: investors around the world trust Hong Kong, and our city is vibrant, stable, and poised for long-term growth under ""One Country, Two Systems"".

286. Hong Kong faces challenges and is also presented with continuing opportunities amid the changing world. Our country, the world's second-largest economy, is our staunchest supporter and the source of our biggest opportunities. Combined with Hong Kong's international prospects, our opportunities far outweigh the challenges. By working together, innovating, and embracing reform, we will turn our beloved Hong Kong into an even better home for everyone. The Pearl of the Orient will keep shining brighter than ever before.

²âµSignatories of the Good Employer Charter have to pledge to be an employee-oriented employer and have adopted the good human resource management practices."
​行政長官向立法會發表《行政長官2025年施政報告》發言全文（十二）,2025-09-17 13:45,2025-09-17 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/17/P2025091700293.htm,"七、勞工支援和保障

247. 面對產業轉型加速、科技日新月異，勞動人口必須持續更新技能，適應經濟發展新常態，把握新機遇。我們會確保本地工人優先就業，同時大力打擊非法勞工。為提升香港勞動人口競爭力和壯大人才庫，我們將革新僱員再培訓局（再培訓局），優化「再就業津貼試行計劃」；同時加強勞工保障，包括保障數碼平台工作者及加強職業安全及健康（職安健）。

確保本地勞工優先就業

248. 人口持續高齡化導致本港勞動人口下降，而適度輸入勞工有助紓緩人力短缺，符合香港整體利益。為確保本地就業優先，我們將推出措施，打擊濫用「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃）的行為。由明日起，優化計劃下申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師時將要求：

(i) 僱主進行本地招聘時間由四星期延長至六星期，期間必須每周參加一次勞工處舉行的實地招聘會。

(ii) 實行更嚴格的人手比例²⁶，由現時以每名申請僱主的所有職位為基礎計算，改為以申請職位計算。換言之，僱主申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師各一名，便須已聘用本地全職侍應生及初級廚師各兩名。

249. 上述措施旨在針對性地打擊濫用情況，並聚焦於輸入勞工較多的指定工種，除確保真正面對本地招聘困難的企業能有序輸入補充勞工，亦避免企業因人手不足而結業，導致原有員工全體失業。

250. 此外，勞工及福利局（勞福局）剛展開人力推算中期更新，重點針對輸入勞工比例較多的行業進行數據分析，將會在2026年完成。勞福局將優先處理相關數據分析，以期提早提供有關部分的分析結果。

加大力度打擊非法勞工

251. 政府會加大力度打擊非法勞工，提高情報收集，成立舉報非法勞工專線，以及組織更多跨部門聯合打擊行動，保障本地工人的就業機會。

革新再培訓局加強本地技能培訓

252. 我在去年《施政報告》提出革新再培訓局，目的是因應香港經濟及產業發展需要，協助所有階層及學歷的勞動人口持續提升技能和競爭力。

253. 再培訓局今年初起已加強培訓、職涯規劃等服務，目前亦已初步勾劃未來三年的改革路線圖。該局會強化行業諮詢機制，着重識別重點技能的需求和缺口，制訂以「技能為本」的培訓框架，並與高等院校合作及導向其他培訓機構，因應技能缺口開發各類別和級別的課程；亦會為失業率較高的行業提供專門的再培訓支援，提升競爭力。長遠推出獲業界認可的微證書課程，讓學員可靈活選修，也會善用科技提供多元靈活的學習模式。政府會因應再培訓局年底前敲定的全新工作計劃修訂《僱員再培訓條例》。

優化「再就業津貼試行計劃」

254. 勞工處去年7月推出為期三年的「再就業津貼試行計劃」，計劃反應理想，截至今年8月已錄得超過50 000名參加者及超過27 000宗就業個案。勞工處會繼續收集和整理計劃參加者及就業個案的資料及數據，並於明年第一季進行中期檢討，配合「中高齡就業計劃」，探討進一步鼓勵銀齡就業的措施。

按「一年一檢」新機制制訂首個最低工資

255. 政府已同意最低工資委員會提出採用「方程式」的新機制，實行法定最低工資「一年一檢」。首個按新機制得出的法定最低工資水平預計於2026年5月1日生效。

保障數碼平台工作者

256. 外賣及送貨等數碼平台行業盛行，在便利市民的同時也創造工作機會。政府會立法完善平台工作者工傷補償機制，並繼續善用「數碼平台行業三方小組」就持份者關注的議題進行協商。

加強職業安全及健康

257. 2024年建造業致命工業意外較2023年下降30%。勞工處會持續加強巡查執法、宣傳推廣及教育培訓等，深化職安健文化，降低意外機會；亦會善用創新科技與AI，包括使用小型無人機等加強巡查及蒐證能力，亦會支持業界研發提升職安健科技產品。

八、社會福利

精準扶貧

258. 政府會繼續精準扶貧，將資源投放在最需要幫助的人，包括：

(i) 通過香港賽馬會的1,000萬元撥款，豐富「共創明『Teen』校友會」活動，為青少年提供融合香港潮流文化及中華傳統藝術的培訓和體驗。向兒童發展基金注資1億8,000萬元，繼續推行項目促進弱勢社群小學高年級學生的長遠發展，並借鏡「共創明『Teen』計劃」的成功經驗，進一步優化各個項目元素，減少跨代貧窮。

(ii) 增設六個社區客廳，加上已推出的九個社區客廳，預計可惠及約7 000個「劏房」戶，服務超過140萬人次。

(iii) 優化「在校課後託管服務計劃」，取消名額上限，擴大支援有需要的小學生和家長。

(iv) 推出「共建關愛社會資助計劃」，推動支援公益事業的家族辦公室提供資源，推行惠澤弱勢社群的項目。

(v) 以試行方式為離開綜合社會保障援助（綜援）計劃並符合資格領取在職家庭津貼的住戶提供有時限現金獎勵，鼓勵他們自力更生。

(vi) 於2026年中發表《香港精準扶貧工作成果報告》。

照顧長者

259. 政府將繼續貫徹「居家安老為本，院舍照顧為後援」方針，推出以下11項措施：

居家安老

(i) 將「長者社區照顧服務券」的總數增加4 000張至16 000張。

(ii) 新增三個長者鄰舍中心，加強在地區為長者提供支援，預計每年可服務約3 000名長者。

(iii) 以試行方式把政府新建的福利項目設施出租，讓服務營辦機構有更大彈性提供不同資助模式的長者日間護理及支援服務。

(iv) 優化「離院長者綜合支援計劃」，為出院的有需要長者提供社會福利服務支援。

加強院舍照顧服務

(v) 增加約700個新建資助安老宿位。

(vi) 增加1 000張「長者院舍照顧服務劵」至總數7 000張。

(vii) 資助院舍合資格的現職保健員修讀新設的護理保健師專業文憑課程，培育專屬人才，推動業界發展。

優化大灣區養老安排

(viii) 年底前推出試驗計劃，資助選擇赴粵養老的綜援受助長者入住指定在粵安老院，提升生活質素。每名合資格長者每月可獲5,000元資助，名額共1 000個。

(ix) 持續擴展「廣東院舍照顧服務計劃」。由10月起，參加計劃的內地安老院將由15家增至24家，覆蓋城市由六個增至八個。

(x) 年底前亦會推出為期兩年的試行安排，分擔參加「廣東院舍照顧服務計劃」的香港長者在國家基本醫療保障政策下須自付的部分醫療開支。

(xi) 在廣東及福建省養老的香港受惠長者可選擇由政府將可攜現金援助款項直接匯入其內地指定銀行的帳戶，方便香港長者在內地養老。²⁷

支援照顧者

260. 照顧者是長者和殘疾人士的重要支撐，為照顧者提供適當支援能減輕他們的身心壓力，讓他們能更有心力照料長者和殘疾人士。現行措施包括向低收入家庭的照顧者發放津貼；加強暫託服務，讓照顧者有喘息空間；設立24小時由社工接聽電話的熱線；推出一站式資訊平台，以及大規模公眾宣傳和教育活動。

261. 政府會預留每年5億元的經常開支，推出一系列措施加強支援照顧者，包括：

(i) 政府已建立首階段的支援照顧者數據平台，初步連結社署、醫管局和房委會的數據，並會逐步連結更多政府部門及公營機構的數據，擴展支援照顧者數據平台。

(ii) 社署從醫管局得悉高風險照顧者入院後，會安排人員主動接觸他們的被照顧者，並按他們的需要提供緊急支援。

(iii) 整合房委會和社署的數據，識別較缺乏社區支援的高風險護老者、殘疾人士照顧者和獨老或雙老住戶，並調遣關愛隊進行探訪。

(iv) 繼續推行「地區服務及關愛隊伍——支援長者及照顧者計劃」三年，邀請關愛隊主動關懷及探訪相關的高風險家庭，並協助獲關愛隊轉介的住戶按需要安裝及使用「平安鐘」服務。

(v) 為300戶高風險住戶安裝智能意外偵測系統。

(vi) 繼續推行「與照顧者同行」計劃，並培訓前線物業管理人員，為有需要的照顧者提供協助，為期三年。

(vii) 優化現有照顧者資訊網的AI聊天機械人功能。

支援復康人士

設立康復產品指引

262. 政府會與大學團隊合作制訂康復產品消費者指引，以電動輪椅、電動智慧病床和外骨骼機械人為試點，列明產品的基本技術和操作要求，協助長者、殘疾人士及其照顧者選擇合適的康復產品。

增加殘疾人士康復服務

263. 政府會進一步加強殘疾人士康復服務，增加80個私營殘疾人士院舍買位計劃宿位、220個特殊幼兒中心名額、100個展能中心及50個嚴重智障人士宿舍名額。

擴大高齡殘疾人士支援

264. 高齡殘疾人士要面對更多的生活挑戰。政府2026年第二季起將逐步在專為嚴重及中度智障人士而設的宿舍提供一站式支援及照顧服務，並在附設展能中心╱綜合職業康復服務中心的宿舍增加延展照顧名額。上述措施能騰出約700個日間康復服務名額，為居於社區的殘疾人士提供日間訓練，減輕照顧者的壓力。

²⁶全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例為2：1。

²⁷相關措施亦載於第五章「三、粵港澳大灣區建設」部分。

247. In the face of accelerated industrial transformation and ever-evolving technological development, our workforce must continuously acquire new skills to stay abreast of economic development and seize emerging opportunities. We will ensure the employment priority of local workers and combat illegal employment rigorously. To enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's workforce and enlarge the talent pool, we will reform the Employees Retraining Board (ERB) and optimise the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme. We will also strengthen labour protection, including protecting digital platform workers, and enhancing occupational safety and health (OSH).

Ensure Employment Priority of Local Workers

248. As our population continues to age, Hong Kong faces a declining labour force. Importing labour on an appropriate scale helps ease manpower shortages and serves Hong Kong's overall interests. We will launch measures to ensure the employment priority of local workers and combat the abuse of the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS). Starting tomorrow, when applying to import waiters/waitresses and junior cooks under the ESLS, employers are required to:

(i) Extend the local recruitment process from four weeks to six weeks, during which they must once a week attend an on-site job fair organised by the Labour Department (LD).

(ii) Implement the manning ratio requirement²³more stringently such that it is calculated based on posts being applied for, but not on all posts engaged by an employer. In other words, an employer applying to import a waiter/waitress and a junior cook must have already employed two local full-time waiters/waitresses and two local full-time junior cooks.

249. The above measures aim to combat abuse in a targeted manner, focusing on job categories with more imported workers, while ensuring businesses with genuine difficulties in local recruitment are allowed to import supplementary labour in an orderly manner to avoid business closures and collateral damage to existing employees.

250. In addition, the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) has just begun a mid-term update of the Manpower Projection with focus on analysing data of industries with a larger number of imported labour. The update will be completed in 2026. The LWB will accord priority to analysing the relevant data, and provide its findings on relevant parts in advance.

Enhance Actions to Combat Illegal Employment

251. The Government will step up efforts to combat illegal employment, establish a dedicated hotline for reporting illegal workers, and strengthen intelligence collection and inter-departmental joint enforcement operations to safeguard the employment opportunities of local workers.

Reform the Employees Retraining Board and Strengthen Local Skills Training

252. In the last Policy Address, I announced the reform of the ERB. The aim is to assist members of the workforce, from all backgrounds and educational attainments, to enhance their skills and competitiveness on a continuous basis, to meet the needs of economic and industrial development in Hong Kong.

253. Since early this year, the ERB has enhanced such services as training and career planning, and outlined an initial reform roadmap for the next three years. The ERB will strengthen its industry consultative mechanism, and identify demand for and gaps in core skills in a targeted manner to devise a skills-based training framework. It will collaborate with higher education institutions and guide other training bodies in developing courses of various types and levels to fill the skill gaps. In future, the ERB will also launch micro-credential courses recognised by industries to offer greater flexibility to trainees, and make good use of technology to offer diversified and flexible modes of learning. When the ERB finalises the full implementation by the end of this year, the Government will amend the Employees Retraining Ordinance accordingly.

Optimise the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme

254. The LD launched the three-year Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme in July last year. The scheme has been well-received, with over 50 000 participants and more than 27 000 placements recorded as of August this year. The LD will continue to collect and collate information and data on the participants and placements of the scheme, conducting a mid term review in the first quarter of next year, along with the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged, to explore measures promoting silver employment.

Set the First Minimum Wage Rate According to the New Annual Review Mechanism

255. The Government has agreed to the new mechanism of adopting a formula for implementing the annual review of the Statutory Minimum Wage (SMW) rate proposed by the Minimum Wage Commission. The first SMW rate derived under the new mechanism is expected to take effect on 1 May 2026.

Protect Digital Platform Workers

256. The prevalence of digital platforms, such as those providing food and goods delivery services, has brought convenience to the public and created job opportunities. The Government will improve the work injury compensation mechanism for digital platform workers through legislation, and continue to make good use of the Tripartite Committee for the Digital Platform Industry to discuss issues of concern to the stakeholders.

Enhance Occupational Safety and Health

257. We saw a 30% drop in the number of fatal construction accidents in 2024 compared with 2023. The LD will continue to step up inspection and enforcement, promotion and publicity, as well as education and training, to build a stronger OSH culture and reduce accidents. The department will also make good use of innovative technologies and AI, such as using drones to enhance inspection and evidence collection, and support the industry in developing technology products that enhance OSH.

(H) Social Welfare

Targeted Poverty Alleviation

258. The Government will continue its work on targeted poverty alleviation by directing resources to those most in need. Relevant measures include:

(i) Enrich activities of the Strive and Rise Alumni Club with $10 million funding from the HKJC, providing young people with training and experience that integrate Hong Kong pop culture and traditional Chinese arts; and inject $180 million into the Child Development Fund to continue implementing projects promoting the long-term development of upper primary students from disadvantaged communities, and further enhance different elements of the projects by drawing on the successful experience of the Strive and Rise Programme, with a view to reducing intergenerational poverty.

(ii) Set up six additional Community Living Rooms (CLRs). Together with the nine CLRs already launched, they are expected to benefit about 7 000 SDU households, serving over 1.4 million attendances.

(iii) Enhance the School-based After School Care Service Scheme by uncapping the number of places to expand support for primary students and parents in need.

(iv) Roll out the ""Co-build a Caring Society Funding Scheme"" to encourage family offices involved in philanthropic endeavours to provide resources implementing projects that benefit the disadvantaged groups.

(v) Provide time-limited cash incentives, on a pilot basis, for households leaving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) Scheme and eligible for the Working Family Allowance, to promote self-reliance.

(vi) Publish the Report on Impact of Targeted Poverty Alleviation Strategy in Hong Kong in mid-2026.

Care for the Elderly

259. The Government will continue to adhere to the principle of promoting ""ageing in place as the core, with institutional care as back-up"". Eleven measures will be introduced:

Ageing in Place

(i) Increase the total number of Community Care Service Vouchers for the Elderly by 4 000 to 16 000.

(ii) Set up three new Neighbourhood Elderly Centres to strengthen support at the district level. They are expected to serve some 3 000 elderly persons annually.

(iii) Lease out newly built government welfare facilities on a pilot basis to allow service operators greater flexibility in offering day care and support services for the elderly under different funding modes.

(iv) Enhance the Integrated Discharge Support Programme for Elderly Patients to provide social welfare service support for discharged elderly persons in need.

Strengthen Residential Care Services

(v) Provide about 700 new subsidised residential care service places.

(vi) Increase the total number of Residential Care Service Vouchers for the Elderly by 1 000 to 7 000.

Enhance Elderly Care Arrangements in the Greater Bay Area

(viii) Launch a pilot scheme by the end of this year to subsidise elderly CSSA recipients choosing to retire in Guangdong to reside in designated residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) in the province, thereby enhancing their quality of life. Each eligible elderly person will receive a monthly subsidy of $5,000, subject to a quota of 1 000.

(ix) Expand continuously the Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong. Starting from October, the number of Mainland RCHEs participating in the scheme will increase from 15 to 24, while the number of cities covered will increase from six to eight.

(x) Launch a two-year pilot arrangement by the end of this year to share part of the medical expenses that Hong Kong elderly participants of the Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong need to bear on their own under the National Basic Medical Insurance Policy.

(xi) Facilitate Hong Kong elderly recipients retiring in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces by providing the option to receive Government assistance directly through their bank accounts with designated Mainland banks²â´.

Support Carers

260. Carers play an important role in supporting elderly persons and persons with disabilities (PWDs). When carers are provided with appropriate support to alleviate physical and mental stress, they are better able to take care of elderly persons and PWDs. Current measures include providing allowance for carers from low-income families, enhancing respite services to give carers a break, setting up a 24-hour hotline manned by social workers, launching a one-stop information gateway, and organising large-scale publicity and public education activities.

261. The Government will earmark an annual recurrent expenditure of $500 million to roll out a series of measures to enhance support for carers, including:

(i) The Government has launched the first phase of the Carer Support Data Platform, which initially connects the data of the SWD, the HA and the HKHA, and progressively connect the data of more government departments and public organisations to expand the Carer Support Data Platform.

(ii) Upon learning from the HA that a high-risk carer has been hospitalised, the SWD will arrange outreach to the care recipients and offer emergency support according to their needs.

(iii) We have consolidated the data of the HKHA and the SWD to identify high-risk carers of elderly persons and carers of PWDs, as well as singleton or doubleton elderly households lacking sufficient community support, and deploy Care Teams to conduct visits.

(iv) We will continue implementing the District Services and Community Care Teams – Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers for three years by inviting Care Teams to actively provide support for and pay visit to high-risk families, and assisting households referred by Care Teams in installing and using the emergency alarm system as necessary.

(v) We will install an intelligent accident detection system for 300 high-risk households.

(vi) We will continue the implementation of the Support for Carers Project for three years, with a view to providing training for frontline property management personnel in assisting carers in need.

(vii) We will enhance the existing AI chatbot function of the Information Gateway for Carers.

Support Persons in Rehabilitation

Formulate Guidelines on Rehabilitation Products

262. The Government will collaborate with university teams to formulate guidelines for consumers of rehabilitation products, with electric wheelchairs, electric smart beds, and robotic exoskeletons as pilot items. The guidelines will set out basic technical and operational requirements of rehabilitation products, to assist the elderly, PWDs and their carers in selecting suitable products.

Provide Additional Rehabilitation Services for Persons with Disabilities

263. The Government will strengthen rehabilitation services for PWDs by adding 80 places under the Bought Place Scheme for Private Residential Care Homes for PWDs, 220 places at Special Child Care Centres, 100 places at Day Activity Centres (DACs), and 50 places at Hostels for Severely Mentally Handicapped Persons.

Expand Support for Ageing Persons with Disabilities

264. Ageing PWDs face additional challenges in their daily life. The Government will, starting from the second quarter of 2026, progressively introduce one-stop support and care services at hostels for severely and moderately mentally handicapped persons, and increase the number of extended care places at hostels co-located with DACs/integrated vocational rehabilitation services centres. These measures will release about 700 day rehabilitation training places, providing day training for PWDs living in the community and alleviating the pressure on carers.

²³The ratio of full-time local employees to imported workers is 2:1.
²â´The relevant measure is also stipulated under Chapter V ""(C) Development of the GBA"".

Through a strategy of identification, intervention and treatment, the Government places great importance on the public's mental health and has introduced a Three-tier School-based Emergency Mechanism. We also place equal emphasis to prevention, which involves building families, friendships and interpersonal networks; focusing on the development of interests and personality; and creating supportive environments in schools and workplaces. All these initiatives require joint efforts, bringing together the Government, the community and families, as well as professional support and treatment when needed. The Government will enhance nine measures in the following aspects:

(i) Regularise the three-tier emergency mechanism in secondary schools and extend it on a trial basis to Primary Four to Six students to strengthen support for those in need.

(ii) Utilise the Dedicated Fund for subvented welfare service organisations, providing training to enhance school social workers' capabilities in handling students' mental health issues.

(iii) Step up the promotion of mental health in the community through the 4Rs Mental Health Charter¹â¶in primary and secondary schools and the Mental Health Workplace Charter¹â·, encouraging more school staff to receive training related to mental health first aid. A ""special recognition category"" will be introduced to commend schools and organisations that arrange a specific number of staff members to receive mental health training (e.g. mental health first aid).

(iv) Launch the Pilot Programme on Training for Mental Health Promotion Ambassador to mobilise and train mental health promotion ambassadors to promote healthy lifestyles, foster resilience and establish care support networks.

(v) Social media has profound impacts on the mental health of children and adolescents. The DH will update relevant guidelines to mitigate the impact of social media on the health of children and adolescents.

(vi) Basic mental health programme has already been made a compulsory subject for first-year students in some tertiary institutions, with related support provided for students in need. The Government will encourage more institutions to promote mental health on campus.

(vii) Currently, three DHCs provide free mental-health assessments and arrange follow-up services under the Healthy Mind Pilot Project, producing satisfactory results. The Government will extend the project in 2026 to cover six more DHCs, with follow-up services to be provided by practitioners with an academic background and training in fields such as psychology or counselling.

(viii) Leverage technologies to enhance mental health services. Initiatives include strengthening telehealth services for psychiatric day hospitals and outreach services to provide suitable patients with more convenient service options, and enhancing the text counselling platform for online emotional support and the Cyber Youth Support Teams of the Social Welfare Department (SWD) by strengthening AI application for more precise identification of high-risk targets in need of support.

(ix) Complete the formulation of the stepped care model on mental health by the end of this year, setting out the roles of mental health professionals and stakeholders, as well as their division of work in mental health services, enhancing training to raise professionals' awareness of making referrals, and establishing the referral mechanism.

(E) Green and Low -arbon Living Environment

Develop Hong Kong into a Demonstration Base for Green Technology

235. We will promote the commercialisation of green I&T outcomes. Relevant measures include supporting the market development of technologies for battery-swapping EVs and automated battery-swapping stations, encouraging the construction of district cooling systems by non-government entities, and driving the market to accelerate carbon reduction in existing buildings.

Enhance Charging Networks for Electric Vehicles

236. We have launched a $300 million Fast Charger Incentive Scheme, with an additional 3 000 fast chargers to be provided by the end of 2028. The Government also plans to roll out six sites for the provision of fast charging stations, while bus operators will open up their charging facilities for use by other vehicles.
Reduce and Recycle Waste to Achieve ""Zero Landfill""

237. The disposal rate of municipal solid waste has been declining for the past three years. The Government will continue to optimise service hours and locations of GREEN@COMMUNITY facilities, support recycling initiatives in residential buildings, and promote waste separation in PRH estates. The Government continues to increase the number of food waste smart recycling bins and collection facilities in residential areas this year, working towards the goal of ""one bin per block"" in PRH estates.

238. I·PARK1¹â¸will progressively begin operation by the end of this year. To expand our waste-to-energy capacity, the Government will seek funding approval from the LegCo next year for the construction of I·PARK2. Hong Kong's first modern recycled paper-pulping facility, located at EcoPark, will begin trial operation by the end of this year.

Jointly Develop the Greater Bay Area into a Beautiful Bay Area

239. Hong Kong will take part in developing the GBA into an international, first-class beautiful bay area, with Victoria Harbour as the core for development together with Mirs Bay and Port Shelter. We will take forward measures on the prevention and control of nearshore pollution, co-ordinated protection of ecosystems and shoreline remediation to support the initiative of developing Beautiful Bays¹â¹advocated in our country's 14th Five Year Plan.

(F) Support the Local Economy

Support Small and Medium Enterprises

240. Hong Kong is home to some 360 000 SMEs, and they are the pillars of our economic development. To better cope with the city's economic restructuring, the Government will introduce the following 11 measures to enhance support for SMEs:

(i) Extend the application period for the 80% Guarantee Product under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme for two years, and further extend the principal moratorium arrangement for one year. The Government will also encourage banks to continue to adopt an accommodating and more flexible approach when processing loans by enterprises with sound repayment ability.

(ii) Provide concessions of fees and charges to alleviate pressure on business operations. The Government will reduce water and sewage charges for non-domestic accounts by 50%, subject to a monthly ceiling of $10,000 and $5,000 respectively per account. About 260 000 non-domestic accounts are expected to benefit from the measure. We will also reduce the trade effluent surcharge by 50%, which is expected to benefit about 35 000 businesses mainly in the catering industry. In addition, fees for the first issue or renewal of licences and permits, including those for hawkers, food businesses, agriculture and fisheries industries and liquor licences²â° will be waived, which is expected to benefit over 60 000 licensees. The above measures will be implemented for one year.

(iii) Considering that the original estimate for the Government's average annual capital works expenditure in the coming five years was about $120 billion, we will earmark an additional $30 billion in the next two to three years to increase expenditure on works projects driving sustained economic development, to support the local construction industry.

(iv) In streamlining the restaurant licensing regime, new operators with provisional licences are currently allowed to begin business while seeking to complete their formal licence application. Such arrangement of ""licence first, inspection later"" has further expedited approval procedures whereas simplified administrative procedures have enabled new operators of restaurants that have changed hands to start business even sooner.

  To further expedite the approval process of applications for outside seating accommodation (OSA) of restaurants, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department will adopt a new way by proactively co-ordinating various relevant departments to undergo ""joint-vetting"" to resolve the matter together, and when necessary, escalate the process regarding complicated applications to the relevant Permanent Secretary or even the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration for steer; at the same time, the procedures will be streamlined, including adopting standardised Government rent for OSA, and allowing some applications to proceed without the requirement for increasing kitchen area and bathroom facilities. As for applications involving walkways with a remaining width of three metres or more after the provision of OSA, they will generally be considered as meeting the basic traffic requirements and do not have to be reviewed case-by-case.

(v) Inject $1.43 billion into the BUD Fund²¹ and expand its geographical scope to cover eight more economies, including B&R countries. We will also enhance promotion and facilitate the participation of companies in exhibitions and export marketing activities through ""Easy BUD"".

(vi) Increase financing support for local e-commerce businesses and expanding the coverage of free buyer credit checks through the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation.

(vii) Set up the ""Economic and Trade Express"", joining the efforts of ETOs and overseas offices of InvestHK and the HKTDC to form a functional platform, encouraging local SMEs and start-ups to conduct more overseas visits exploring business opportunities, while bringing in more enterprises to invest in and establish businesses in Hong Kong.

(viii) Enhance Cyberport's Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to provide SMEs with subsidies, on a matching basis, to empower enterprises to apply AI and cybersecurity solutions, boosting their competitiveness and information security.

(ix) Support the continued organisation of the Hong Kong Shopping Festival, covering the Mainland and ASEAN e-commerce markets over the next three years to promote Hong Kong brands.

(x) Strengthen training and information services through the four SME centres, the Mentorship Programme of the Trade and Industry Department and the E Commerce Express under the HKTDC. We will also implement the ""Creativity • Ecommerce – Beyond Limits"" programme and provide one-stop business matching and referral services to strengthen the interface between Hong Kong enterprises and e-commerce service providers, enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong products on cross-border e-commerce platforms.

(xi) Launch a two-year pilot scheme to support local small and medium I&T enterprises with patent evaluation.²²

Economic Diversification

Develop the Food Industry

241. As a brand, ""Food from Hong Kong"" enjoys a good reputation. Apart from facilitating the sale of such food to the Mainland, the Government has also reserved land near the Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point to promote the food industry, including wholesale, processing and trading. In the long run, it may develop into a food industrial park to promote ""food production + tourism"".

242. The Government will strengthen the competitiveness of local produce, introducing a unified brand for local agricultural and fisheries products in mid-2026 to enhance product awareness and brand value.

Promote the Development of the Agriculture and Fisheries Industries

243. The marine economy has enormous potential, and fisheries is among its components. The Government will issue culture licenses for new fish culture zones and provide deep-sea cages for rental by the fisheries industry, to increase local mariculture production by tenfold within 15 years. Modernised aquaculture will also be promoted.

244. The Government will facilitate the livestock sector to construct the first environmentally-friendly, multi-storey pig farm, in Lo Wu. It will also take forward the Agricultural Park Phase 2 development, and promote leisure farming and fisheries.

Promote a Pet-friendly Culture

245. According to government statistics, more than 240 000 households in Hong Kong keep more than 400 000 cats and dogs as pets, generating an enormous consumption market, including food and products, healthcare, insurance, grooming, training and more. In recent years, the business sector and transport operators have developed pet-friendly premises and travel arrangements. The Government supports the business sector in offering pet-friendly spaces to create new opportunities.

246. The Government will introduce a licensing arrangement allowing operators to let dogs enter their food premises. Clear signage will be put up by permitted restaurants, so that customers know dogs are allowed. Pet-friendly restaurants will create new business opportunities for the industry.

¹âµThe Government will sign a co-operation framework agreement with the National Cancer Center to deepen collaboration in basic cancer research, screening, early diagnosis and treatment, big data application, public education outreach and other areas.

¹â¶The ""4Rs"" in the 4Rs Mental Health Charter cover four elements and objectives for promoting mental health, which include

(1) Rest: Help students cultivate healthy habits from an early age including having enough rest, adequate sleep and leisure activities.

(2) Relaxation: Teach students to take the time to relax, take care of their mental health and practise self compassion.

(3) Relationship: Strengthen the relationships among students, teachers and students, as well as parents and children, so as to enhance their sense of connectedness; help students understand their roles and their importance in these relationships, so as to willingly take on responsibilities and make contributions.

(4) Resilience: Equip students to adapt to the inevitable stress and setbacks in life, and teach students to deal with emotions, cope with stress and overcome difficulties with a positive attitude.

¹â·As part of the ""Shall We Talk"" initiative on mental health promotion and public education, the Mental Health Workplace Charter aims to promote mental health in workplace, objectives include to promote mental well-being at workplace including a respectful and positive environment; promote active listening and communication, encourage help-seeking, and facilitate early identification of mental distress and timely treatment; and create an inclusive and friendly workplace environment for colleagues with mental distress.

¹â¸I·PARK1 and I·PARK2, located on an artificial island off Shek Kwu Chau and at Tsang Tsui, Tuen Mun respectively, are waste-to-energy (electric energy) facilities, generating electricity by processing municipal solid waste.

¹â¹The development of Beautiful Bays is an important means of marine ecological environment protection for our country and an integral part of building a Beautiful China in the maritime area. ""Pristine water and beaches, thriving marine life, and harmonious co-existence between humans and the sea"" is the aim of the overall enhancement in ecological environment quality. It is being realised through actions such as improvements in quality and effectiveness, the rehabilitation of ecosystems and the remediation of effluent discharge outlets, striving to transform 283 marine bays throughout China into beautiful bays by 2035.

²â°Food business licences, including provisional ones (if applicable), cover the General Restaurant Licence, the Light Refreshment Restaurant Licence, the Marine Restaurant Licence, the Bakery Licence, the Cold Store Licence, the Factory Canteen Licence, the Food Factory Licence, the Fresh Provision Shop Licence, the Frozen Confection Factory Licence, the Milk Factory Licence, the Siu Mei and Lo Mei Shop Licence, the Restricted Food Permit and the Composite Restricted Foods Permit. As for licences related to the agriculture and fisheries industries, they include the Marine Fish Culture Licence and the Livestock Keeping Licence.

²¹Referring to the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales.

²²The relevant measure is also stipulated under Chapter VII ""(C) Regional Intellectual Property Trading Centre"".

行政長官向立法會發表《行政長官2025年施政報告》發言全文（十）,2025-09-17 13:08,2025-09-17 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/17/P2025091700287.htm,"第九章安居生活關愛共融

206. 「惠民生」是我的施政重點。本屆政府上任以來，一直致力拼經濟、謀發展，提升經濟長遠競爭力，增添發展動能，目的就是要為改善民生提供堅實基礎，增加市民的幸福感與獲得感。這是《施政報告》的民生專章，是篇幅最長的一章，涵蓋九個與市民生活息息相關的重點範疇。

一、增供應豐富置業階梯

207. 保障市民基本的住屋需求是施政的首要任務。我上任後加速興建公營房屋、推出創新「簡約公屋」、打擊濫用公屋等，優化了基層住屋保障。現時，公營房屋在供應持續增加的情況下，政府有條件加大力度協助基層置業。我們會增加居者有其屋計劃（居屋）和綠表置居計劃（綠置居）單位的供應，並優化出售及轉讓安排，協助更多公屋居民置業，同時便利資助出售單位的業主進入私樓市場，豐富房屋階梯，協助不同階層市民安居樂業。

增加公營房屋供應

208. 2026-27年度起的五年，總體公營房屋建屋量（包括簡約公屋）將達189 000個單位，較我上任時增加約80%。三年前，公屋申請者平均要等候6.1年才可上樓，經過本屆政府三年多的努力，公屋綜合輪候時間已縮短整整一年至5.1年，進一步邁向2026-27年度下降至4.5年的目標。對「劏房」戶來說，早一年入住公屋或「簡約公屋」，不但可改善居住環境，更可分別節省平均每年約36,000元或50,000元的租金。

209. 我三年前宣布推出的3萬個「簡約公屋」單位，今年底前會有約1萬個單位落成啟用，另外2萬個將在未來一年半內全部落成。

210. 取締劣質「劏房」的「簡樸房」規管制度正在立法會審議，如草案獲通過，明年3月將正式實施。

重建公屋

211. 香港房屋委員會（房委會）今年內會公布馬頭圍邨及西環邨的重建計劃，並將研究重建模範邨。

豐富置業階梯

212. 隨着公營房屋供應增加，我們會按部就班協助市民置業，包括以下六項措施：

(i) 居屋供應比本屆政府上任時的五年期預期增加約50%，無論綠表或白表人士購買居屋的機會都顯著增加。在居屋供應顯著增加的基礎上，我們會將綠白表配額比例由40：60調升至50：50，協助更多公屋租戶變成業主，同時讓原有公屋流轉給輪候申請人，達致一舉兩得。

(ii) 為增加白表人士透過二手市場購買未補價資助出售房屋的機會，房委會由下一期「白表居屋第二市場（白居二）計劃」起，再增加1 000個配額，總數達7 000個；1 000個新增配額的其中一半會撥予40歲以下青年家庭及一人申請者。

(iii) 為避免白居二配額因個人意願轉變而被浪費，房委會發出批准信的數額將適量大於白居二配額，讓購買單位的配額得以盡用，以盡量滿足買家期望。

(iv) 提升居屋和綠置居面積較大單位的比例，以回應市場需要。

(v) 放寬新出售單位的轉讓限制年期由15年降低至10年，以鼓勵居民上進上流，適用於下一期起推出的居屋及綠置居。

(vi) 推出房委會資助出售單位「長者業主樓換樓計劃」，容許年滿60歲並擁有單位十年或以上的業主，可在第二市場出售該單位後不須補價，購買一個較小或較偏遠的單位，讓長者可獲得額外現金作生活費，同時騰出市區或較大單位讓有需要家庭申請。

213. 房委會及香港房屋協會將推出先導計劃，容許擁有資助出售單位十年或以上的業主，在繳付出租准許費後將其未補價單位出租予合資格白表申請者，計劃名額3 000個。

私營房屋供應

214. 根據《長遠房屋策略》，未來十年私營房屋需求為126 000個單位。政府未來十年會有足夠土地滿足上述需求，並會有節有度及務實地部署推出的步伐。除了政府賣地項目外，其他私營房屋土地來源包括鐵路物業發展項目、市區重建局項目及私人發展項目。

二、土地開發

215. 政府必須儲備充足的土地，以滿足大型發展項目、長期經濟發展和市民住屋的需要。土地儲備就如銀行存款，需時可用，閒時則存。我們會持續造地並掌握土地供應主導權，同時透過精簡審批程序、優化行政流程、加強內部協作，以及善用科技和檢視標準等，提升造地效率和降低建造成本，以保障市民利益和發展需要。

建立土地儲備

216. 未來十年將準備好約2 600公頃「熟地」¹⁶，除滿足發展需求，亦讓政府有健康的土地儲備。

減低建造成本

217. 我們會繼續精簡法定程序和行政流程，包括：

(i) 簡化工程審批，訂立清晰服務時間承諾，並加強統籌相關部門的審批流程，加快審批。

(ii) 房屋署將設立「項目促成辦公室」，就公營房屋工程協調各部門加快完成工作。房屋局已實行新管控方法，為完成工程訂立目標時間，「倒逼」各環節加快落成。

(iii) 善用科技，發展局將於明年推行「成本管控數碼平台」，建立市場價格資料庫，並應用AI分析過往政府工程的成本數據等，確保未來項目設計更具成本效益。房屋署亦已利用自主研發的「BIM系統化地基工程設計」，自動生成設計方案，進一步節省成本。

(iv) 「香港建築科技研究院」會持續檢視政府工程的建築標準及要求，房屋局亦會研究在公營房屋建築物料審批時，認可更多地區的標準。

(v) 政府將放寬私人發展項目中停車場總樓面面積的豁免安排，發展商如在地面興建不超過兩層停車場，其總樓面面積可獲全數豁免，並取消興建地庫停車場作為豁免條件的強制要求。

(vi) 發展局會在明年上半年試行中央集中採購，將率先應用於包括鋼筋和「組裝合成」構件等常用物料，以節省成本。房屋局亦會在明年試行集中採購「組裝合成」構件，並已設立標準建築物料資料庫，涵蓋鋁窗、間隔牆等常用物料，以加快審批流程。

釋放市區工業用地

218. 2000年起，規劃署已進行五輪全港工業用地分區研究，將部分工業用地改劃作住宅、商貿等用途。政府今年將展開新一輪研究，明年內提出建議，包括活化工廈計劃未來路向。

市區重建新思維

219. 我們會以新思維利用新發展土地推動市區重建，包括：

(i) 放寬目前同區地積比率轉移安排，容許重建項目未用盡的地積比率跨區轉移到其他地區以至新發展區，增加市場重建誘因。

(ii) 在北都古洞北及粉嶺北新發展區預留三幅土地讓市區重建局籌劃興建新樓，作為將來「樓換樓」的替代單位。

(iii) 針對重建需要較迫切的七個指定地區¹⁷，試行適度增加私人重建項目地積比率，容許將增加的地積比率轉移至北都或其他地區使用，或轉為金額用作抵銷在投地或進行其他項目地契修訂、原址換地所須繳付的地價。

提升建築安全

220. 政府明年會修訂《建築物條例》，加大違反法定通知或命令和嚴重僭建的阻嚇性，並加強規管承建商。

三、便利交通出行

公布《運輸策略藍圖》

221. 運輸及物流局年底前會公布《運輸策略藍圖》，勾劃運輸發展的方向和具體措施。

智慧綠色集體運輸系統

222. 啟德智慧綠色集體運輸系統項目快將招標，東九龍及洪水橋╱厦村新發展區兩個項目則於明年招標。

加快引進集體運輸系統

223. 為快速引進世界各地新型集體運輸系統，政府會制訂可適用於不同系統技術和營運商的規管框架，明年提交條例草案。

推廣自動駕駛車輛

224. 政府去年已為自動車建立規管框架。今年會批出三個區域作測試，以自動車跨區行走和接駁其他交通工具為目標，加速自動駕駛在香港無人化、規模化發展，盡快達致商業營運，推動業界以香港平台開拓海外尤其右軚市場。

立法規管網約車

225. 香港網約車監管問題存在超過11年。本屆政府決心解決，會爭取在本屆立法會休會前通過規管網約車服務的法例，保障市民出行安全。

¹⁶「熟地」指已經完成規劃、清拆及平整等程序，可隨時動工發展的土地。

¹⁷去年生效的《2024年土地（為重新發展而強制售賣）（修訂）條例》按分區計劃大綱圖（大綱圖）所覆蓋地區，指定了七個具較迫切重建需要的地區，分別為：長沙灣（所屬大綱圖亦覆蓋深水埗）、馬頭角（包括九龍城和土瓜灣）、旺角、西營盤及上環（屬同一大綱圖）、荃灣、灣仔及油麻地。

Facilitate Stable Living in a Caring and Inclusive Society

206. Improving people's livelihood is my key policy priority. Since taking office, the current-term Government has been striving to build a vibrant economy and promote development. These efforts aim to enhance our economy's long-term competitiveness, generate strong growth momentum, and lay a solid foundation for improving the well-being of our people – ultimately increasing their sense of happiness and well-being. This chapter on livelihood is the longest in the Policy Address, covering nine areas that are closely linked to the everyday lives of Hong Kong residents.

(A) Increase Housing Supply and Enrich the Housing Ladder

207. Safeguarding the basic housing needs of people of Hong Kong is the top priority of our governance. Since assuming office, I have strengthened housing protection for the grassroots by accelerating the construction of PRH, launching the innovative LPH and cracking down on PRH tenancy abuse. With the supply of PRH continuously increasing, the Government is now well positioned to further assist the grassroots in achieving home ownership. We will increase the supply of flats under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) and the Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH), optimise the sale and alienation restriction arrangements, help more PRH tenants realise home ownership, while enabling the owners of subsidised sale flats (SSFs) enter into the private housing market. With the housing ladder enriched, we can support residents across all walks of life to live and work happily.

Increase Public Housing Supply

208. In the five years starting from 2026-27 onwards, the overall public housing production (including LPH) will reach 189 000 units, about 80% higher than when I took office. Three years ago, PRH applicants had to wait 6.1 years on average before they were offered PRH. With our efforts over the past three years or so, the Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing has been shortened by a whole year to 5.1 years, and we are moving closer to the target of reducing it to 4.5 years in 2026-27. Subdivided unit (SDU) households can improve their living conditions by moving into PRH or LPH units one year earlier, while saving about $36,000 or $50,000 in rent on average per year respectively.

209. Three years ago, I announced the launch of 30 000 LPH units. About 10 000 of them will be completed for intake by the end of this year. The remaining 20 000 units will be completed in the coming year and a half.

210. The Basic Housing Unit regulatory regime, designed to eradicate substandard SDUs, is being scrutinised by the LegCo. Subject to passage of the bill, the regime will be implemented in March next year.

Redevelop Public Rental Housing Estates

211. The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) will announce redevelopment plans for Ma Tau Wai Estate and Sai Wan Estate this year. A study will also be conducted on the redevelopment of Model Housing Estate.

Enrich the Housing Ladder

212. With the increase in public housing supply, we will take measured steps to help people of Hong Kong achieve home ownership. They include the six measures below:

(i) Given the supply of HOS flats in the next five years is expected to be about 50% more than the five-year supply when the current-term Government took office, opportunities for both Green Form (GF) and White Form (WF) applicants to purchase HOS flats will increase significantly. On the basis that the supply of HOS flats are substantially increasing, we will increase the ratio of quotas between GF and WF from 40:60 to 50:50 to assist more PRH tenants to become owners, while at the same time transfer the original PRH units to Waiting List applicants, benefitting both parties at the same time.

(ii) To increase opportunities for WF applicants to purchase SSFs with unpaid premium in the secondary market, the HKHA will increase the quota of the White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) by 1 000 to 7 000, starting from the next WSM exercise. Half of the 1 000 additional quota will be allocated to young family and one-person applicants below 40.

(iii) To prevent forfeiture of the WSM quota because of personal preferences, the number of approval letters issued by the HKHA will be suitably higher than the quota set under the WSM exercise, ensuring that the quota for flat purchases can be fully utilised, in order to strive to meet the expectations of the purchasers.

(iv) We will increase the ratio of larger units in HOS and GSH projects in response to market needs.

(v) We will relax the alienation restriction period of new flats for sale from 15 years to 10 years to encourage upward mobility. This measure will be applicable starting from the next HOS and GSH sale exercises.

(vi) We will launch the ""Flat-for-Flat Scheme for Elderly Owners"" of HKHA's SSFs, allowing those who have reached the age of 60 and owned their flat for 10 years or more to purchase a smaller flat or a flat in a more remote area after selling their original one in the secondary market with premium unpaid. In doing so, they can get additional cash to cover their living expenses, while urban or larger flats can be released for families in need to apply for.

213. The HKHA and the Hong Kong Housing Society will introduce a pilot scheme, allowing those who have owned an SSF for 10 years or more to let their flats with unpaid premium to eligible WF applicants after paying relevant fees, subject to a quota of 3 000.

Private Housing Supply

214. According to the Long Term Housing Strategy, the supply target for private housing in the coming decade is projected to be 126 000 units. The Government will have sufficient land to meet the demand in the next ten years, and will roll out such land to the market in an orderly and pragmatic manner. Besides Government land sale, other sources of private housing land supply include railway property development and Urban Renewal Authority (URA) projects, as well as private development projects.

(B) Land Development

215. The Government must maintain an ample supply of land to meet the demand for major development projects, long-term economic development and the community's housing needs. Land reserve is similar to bank savings in that both are saved for use when needed. We will sustain efforts to produce and retain control over the supply of land. In parallel, we will improve the efficiency of land production and lower construction costs by streamlining approval processes, optimising administrative procedures, strengthening internal collaboration, applying technology, reviewing relevant standards and more, so as to safeguard public interests and meet development needs.

Build Land Reserve

216. In the next decade, the Government will get ready around 2 600 hectares of ""spade-ready sites""¹³. Apart from meeting the development needs, this would also provide the necessary room for the Government to build up a healthy land reserve.

Reduce Construction Costs

217. We will continue to streamline statutory procedures and administrative workflows. Relevant measures include:

(i) Simplify works approval procedures, set clear performance pledges, and enhance co-ordination among relevant departments on vetting processes to expedite approval.

(ii) The Housing Department (HD) will set up a Project Facilitation Office to co-ordinate departments in expediting the completion of public housing projects. The Housing Bureau (HB) has implemented a new management approach, under which the target time for project completion is set to prompt the accelerated completion of various project stages.

(iii) Leverage technologies. Next year, the DEVB will launch a Project Cost Management Platform, establishing a market price database and applying AI technology to analyse, for example, past government project cost data, to ensure greater cost-effectiveness in future project designs. The HD has also adopted the self-developed Building Information Modelling (BIM)-enabled Systematic Approach to Foundation Design, which automatically generates designs to further reduce costs.

(iv) The Building Technology Research Institute will continuously review the construction standards and requirements of government projects. In addition, regarding the approval of building materials for public housing, the HB will look into the accreditation of standards of more regions.

(v) The Government will relax the gross floor area (GFA) exemption arrangement for car parks in private developments by removing the mandatory requirement of constructing underground car parks as a condition of exemption, and granting full GFA exemption if developers construct no more than two storeys of above ground car parks.

(vi) The DEVB will conduct central procurement on a trial basis in the first half of next year, piloting in the procurement of commonly used materials including steel reinforcement and Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) modules, in order to save costs. The HB will also pilot the batch procurement of integrated modules of MiC method next year. In addition, the HB has established a database of standard building materials, covering commonly used materials such as aluminium windows and partition walls, to expedite the approval process.

Release Industrial Land in Urban Areas

218. Since 2000, the Planning Department has conducted five rounds of Area Assessments of Industrial Land in the Territory, and some of the industrial land have been rezoned for other uses such as residential and business uses. The Government will commence a new round of study this year and put forward recommendations next year, including the way forward for the Revitalisation Scheme for Industrial Buildings.

Urban Renewal with a New Mind-set

219. Embracing a new mind-set, we will explore the use of newly developed land to take forward urban renewal. Relevant measures include:

(i) Relax the current arrangement for the transfer of plot ratio within the same district to allow the cross-district transfer of unutilised plot ratio from redevelopment projects to other districts or even NDAs, to enhance market incentives for redevelopment.

(ii) Reserve three sites in Kwu Tung North and Fanling North NDAs in the Northern Metropolis for the URA to construct new buildings, which will be used as replacement flats under the ""Flat-for-Flat"" Scheme in the future.

(iii) Suitably increase the plot ratio of private redevelopment projects, on a pilot basis, for the seven designated areas¹â´with more pressing redevelopment need, allowing the increased plot ratio to be transferred for utilisation in the Northern Metropolis or other districts, or to be used for offsetting the premium payable for bidding land, lease modification in other projects or in situ land exchange.

Enhance Construction Safety

220. The Government will amend the Buildings Ordinance next year to enhance the deterrent effect against non-compliance with statutory notices or orders and serious unauthorised building works, and strengthen regulation of contractors.

(C) Enhance Transport and Commuting Convenience

Promulgate the Transport Strategy Blueprint

221. The Transport and Logistics Bureau will publish the Transport Strategy Blueprint by the end of this year to outline directions and specific measures for transport development.

Smart and Green Mass Transit Systems

222. We will soon invite tenders for the smart and green mass transit system project in Kai Tak, and will invite tenders for the projects in East Kowloon and the Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA next year.

Accelerate the Introduction of Mass Transit Systems

223. To speed up the introduction of new mass transit systems from around the world, the Government will devise a regulatory framework applicable to different system technologies and operators, and introduce a bill next year.

Promote Autonomous Vehicles

224. The Government established a regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles (AV) last year. Three areas will be approved this year for AV trials, aiming at AV cross-district travel and connections to other modes of transport, to accelerate the large scale development of driverless autonomous driving in Hong Kong, expediting its transition to commercial operations, and facilitating the industry's expansion to overseas, particularly right-hand-drive markets, using Hong Kong as the platform.

Regulate Ride-hailing Services by Legislation

225. The issue of regulating ride-hailing services in Hong Kong has persisted for over 11 years. The current-term Government is determined to resolve this issue, striving to pass the legislation on regulating the services before the prorogation of the current-term LegCo, with a view to safeguarding the public's travel safety.

¹³ ""Spade-ready sites"" refer to sites that have gone through procedures including rezoning, clearance and formation, and are ready for commencement of works.

¹â´The Land (Compulsory Sale for Redevelopment) (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, which came into effect last year, specified seven areas with more pressing need for renewal based on the areas covered by the OZPs, including Cheung Sha Wan (the same OZP covering also Sham Shui Po), Ma Tau Kok (covering Kowloon City and To Kwa Wan), Mong Kok, Sai Ying Pun and Sheung Wan (covered by the same OZP), Tsuen Wan, Wan Chai and Yau Ma Tei.

Promote the Integrated Development of Culture, Sports and Tourism

174. The Government will continue to advance the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism, generating fresh economic momentum and raising Hong Kong's global appeal.

(A) East-meets-West Centre for International Cultural Exchange

175. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) published the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development last year, setting out clear directions for the long-term development of arts and cultural policies to consolidate Hong Kong's position as the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. We will develop a premium arts trading hub and promote the diverse development of the West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD) and local cultural and creative industries. We will also refocus the performance venues, develop flagship arts and cultural projects, intensify promotion of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), and introduce commercial elements to enrich LCSD facilities and events.

Develop a Premium Arts Trading Hub

176. Hong Kong is among the world's top three arts trading centres. We will step up our efforts to build Hong Kong into a global premium arts trading hub, attracting more international auction houses, galleries, and professionals to establish a presence here. Measures include:

(i) Develop an arts ecosystem at the Airport City to host arts studios, galleries, and dealers under one roof, supported by large-scale arts storage and related facilities.

(ii) Enhance our international arts trading platform by deepening collaboration with Art Basel, thereby consolidating the position of Hong Kong as the exclusive host city in the region.

(iii) Engage the industry to carry out studies on taxation, financing, talent, and related areas of arts trading to explore policy measures applicable to Hong Kong.

177. The WKCD will take forward the development of the arts trading ecosystem and introduce the following measures next year:

(i) Discuss leasing strategies with the developer of Artist Square Towers to attract more arts trading enterprises, including galleries, insurance companies, and family offices, to lease space in the towers, scheduled for completion in 2026-27.

(ii) Establish an international collaboration network for arts conservation, and provide professional training and internship opportunities.

(iii) Expand training for talents in curation, conservation, arts administration, and other fields systematically.

Diverse Development of the West Kowloon Cultural District

178. The WKCD is the most significant arts and cultural infrastructure investment in Hong Kong. The WKCD Authority will:

(i) Organise more high-profile international events, including the second Hong Kong International Cultural Summit and the Annual Conference 2026 of the Association of Asia Pacific Performing Arts Centres.

(ii) Tour exhibitions overseas and in the Mainland to showcase exhibitions and collections of M+ and Hong Kong Palace Museum. M+ will also co-organise exhibitions with internationally renowned museums. More Mainland tours of ""The Impossible Trial""¹¹ will be organised to develop the musical into a long-running classic.

(iii) Commission the WestK Quay at the end of this year to enhance the WKCD's accessibility and foster the complementary development of arts and culture, entertainment and tourism.

(iv) Establish the WestK Academy to provide professional training for arts and cultural organisations and practitioners from Hong Kong, overseas, and the Mainland.

Foster the Development of Local Cultural and Creative Industries

179. Last year, I announced plans to develop Hong Kong into a fashion design hub in Asia. This year, Hong Kong Fashion Fest will promote digital fashion and sustainable fashion in collaboration with Paris Fashion Week and Milan Fashion Week.

180. Over the past three years, films funded by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) through the Film Development Fund have accounted for nearly 30% of Hong Kong films box office receipts. The CCIDA will enhance publicity, exchanges, and business matching overseas and in the Mainland.

181. The CCIDA proactively assists Hong Kong cultural and creative designers in producing more cultural and creative products with Chinese and Hong Kong cultural features, and in the incubation of local cultural IP. It will continue to support the enhancement of the Asia IP Exchange Portal, to strengthen support for local original works to enter the Mainland and international markets.

Refocus the Performance Venues and Promote Performing Arts Mega Events

182. With the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), the Government has announced the enhancement of the positioning of various performance venues. The Hong Kong Coliseum will be refocused to prioritise concerts, the East Kowloon Cultural Centre will promote long-running performances and arts technology, and the Sha Tin Town Hall Auditorium will prominently feature Cantonese opera.

Develop Signature Arts and Cultural Flagship Projects and Strengthen the Promotion of Intangible Cultural Heritage

183. In the past two years, the Government has developed signature arts and cultural flagship projects to attract locals as well as tourists, including the Hong Kong Pop Culture Festival, the Asia+ Festival, the Chinese Culture Festival, the Hong Kong Performing Arts Expo and Hong Kong ICH Month. The Government will continue to strengthen the promotion of district-based ICH, promoting ""ICH Around Town"".

Introduce Market-based Business Models to Enhance the Services of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department

184. We will introduce market-based business models into designated LCSD facilities to provide more diverse value-added activities. These include leasing out museums on their closing days for commercial or private use, opening up more venues for hire, introducing paid guided tours for visitor groups, and developing more cultural and creative products to enhance visitor experience and operational efficacy. We will also explore the feasibility of engaging the market to enhance the operations of the Lei Yue Mun Park holiday camp and selected beaches, promoting the development of recreational, leisure, and aquatic hotspots.

(B) ""Tourism is Everywhere""

185. As of August this year, the overall visitor arrivals had reached 33.2 million, a significant increase of 12% over the same period last year. The CSTB will enhance the development of tourism products and initiatives with local and international characteristics, realising the motif of ""tourism is everywhere"". We will also actively explore new visitor sources, improve visitor arrival arrangements, enhance immigration experience, and develop the yacht economy.

Develop the Yacht Economy

186. With 1 180 kilometres of shoreline and 263 islands, Hong Kong is well-positioned to become a yacht hub in Asia. We will enhance amenities for the yacht industry and promote prime yacht tourism:

(i) Provide approximately 600 additional yacht berths at the ex-Lamma Quarry, the Aberdeen Typhoon Shelter expansion, and the Hung Hom Station waterfront projects.

(ii) Promote the development of the yacht bay at the Airport City, providing more than 500 additional berths, including berths that can accommodate superyachts over 80 metres in length.

(iii) Relax the requirements for visiting yachts and develop a Dynamic Yacht Monitoring System, allowing visiting yachts to anchor at government designated waters and navigate in a safe and orderly manner, without having to reserve berths at privately-operated yacht clubs or piers.

(iv) Enhance the Electronic Business System to allow one-stop, pre-submission of arrival information from visiting yachts for preliminary vetting by relevant departments.

(v) Authorise relevant Mainland organisations to conduct examinations for local yacht masters, and offer short-term training courses to help visiting yacht masters of visiting yachts from the Mainland obtain qualifications for navigation in Hong Kong waters. These measures will be extended to visiting yachts from overseas in due course.

(vi) Promote the systemic development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao individual travel scheme for yachts, and co-operate with the Guangdong Provincial Government on facilitation measures for the northbound travel of yachts from Hong Kong and southbound travel for yachts from the Mainland.

Develop ""Mega Events + Tourism""

187. We will attract visitors to extend their stay in Hong Kong and revisit again by interweaving an array of cultural festivals, tourism projects and mega events, promoting the development of ""mega events + tourism"".

188. Hong Kong Disneyland will upgrade its facilities upon its 20th anniversary this year. The Government will also continue to lead Ocean Park's collaboration with the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) in rolling out more themed events and products to sustain the craze for giant pandas. With next year being the Year of the Horse, the HKJC will organise celebrations and performances under the theme of horse to promote horse racing tourism.

189. To support the hosting of mega events, the Fire Services Department will introduce a facilitation measure for the Temporary Place of Public Entertainment Licence by conducting compliance inspections of fire safety requirement via video conferencing for venues with lower safety risks.

Develop Cruise Tourism

190. Hong Kong's cruise tourism continues to thrive, with an anticipated increase of about 20% this year in the number of ship calls to Hong Kong compared with last year. Following an ongoing review of the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement to boost the appeal and competitiveness of the terminal, the CSTB will begin a tender exercise for the operator of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal by the end of this year.

Develop ""Ecology + Tourism""

191. The Government will launch the ""Four Peaks"" tourism project proposed by the Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots and improve facilities in country parks. In addition, it will construct new facilities such as a tree-top adventure, an open museum of historical relics, and novel campsites.

192. We will also explore suitable means to connect rural attractions such as traditional villages and fields, ancestral halls and study halls, as well as folk activities etc., enriching visitors' experience of rural eco-tours through strolling and cycling.

Promote Local Thematic Immersive Tours

193. We will develop a variety of new tourist attractions, such as promoting the red tourism route of ""Chinese Cultural Celebrities Rescue""; creating thematic floral gardens in the 18 districts; and promoting various immersive tour projects, including Hong Kong's industrial brand tourism, Old Town Central, Kowloon City, Victoria Park Bazaar and the opening of the former Yau Ma Tei Police Station for public visits. We will also open up the frontier closed areas at Mai Po and Starling Inlet for visitors.

194. The HKTB will stage an enhanced version of the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival to step up worldwide promotion of Hong Kong's bar and restaurant offerings, positioning the city as an international culinary hub. We will aestheticise Lan Kwai Fong and the surrounding streetscape in phases to foster ""community-making"". The HAD will also refine application guidelines to facilitate the operation of home-stay lodgings and holiday camps in rural areas. In addition, the DEVB will facilitate the conversion of village houses into home-stay lodgings or community eateries.

Establish Hong Kong as the Most Sought-after Destination for Premium Visitors

195. We will offer tailor-made luxury tours for high-spending visitors, and work with the industry to offer sophisticated itinerary planning, concierge services, and premium experience.
Proactively Develop the Middle East and ASEAN Tourism Markets and Facilitate Halal Certification

196. To further promote Muslim tourism, we will strengthen our strategy of ""accreditation, education, and promotion"", encouraging the industry to provide more Muslim-friendly facilities and food options. The HKTB will launch a funding scheme, beginning today through the end of next year, by providing a half-rate certification fee subsidy, capped at $5,000, for restaurants that have acquired Halal certification.

Enhance Immigration Experience

197. To enhance visitors' immigration experience, we will implement a ""collaborative inspection and joint clearance"" mode at the new Huanggang Port and the Sha Tau Kok Port under redevelopment, relax the eligibility criteria for frequent visitors wishing to use the e-Channel service, and establish Hong Kong's first ""contactless clearance"" pilot checkpoint at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port, which enables immigration clearance via facial recognition technology.

198. We will implement a new ""Outstanding Services Award Scheme"", covering various tourism service industries, to commend merchants and industry practitioners for their outstanding products and services, and promote the hospitable culture through mass media.

(C) Promote Sports Development

199. The Government is fully committed to ensuring the successful delivery of the 15th National Games (NG) competition events in Hong Kong. We will also promote sports development by supporting elite sports, maintaining Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events, enhancing professionalism in sports, developing sports as an industry, and promoting sports in the community. Efforts will be made to continuously improve the functionality and positioning of sports venues, enhance the governance of national sports associations (NSAs), strengthen support for athletes, and step up publicity in the community.
Ensure the Successful Delivery of the National Games

200. Co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao for the first time, the 15th NG as well as the National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the National Special Olympic Games (NGDSO)¹² will be held in November and December 2025 respectively. We will spare no effort in staging the competitions to be held in Hong Kong, and work with Guangdong and Macao to make the 15th NG and NGDSO a success. We have collaborated with the industry to roll out various tourism products related to the Games, and have also arranged for local free television broadcasts to relay the competitions, allowing the public to cheer on the athletes.

Promote Synergy among Sports Venues

201. The KTSP plays a pivotal role in promoting sports mega events and developing sports as an industry. We will leverage its strengths to drive ""sports + mega events"" development.

202. We will review the positioning of the Hong Kong Stadium (HKS) to complement the KTSP and leverage the HKS's existing facilities to support sports development, such as serving as office space for NSAs, organising matches and related training, and hosting large-scale sports events.

203. To attract more world-class players to compete in Hong Kong, we have agreed on a multi-year partnership arrangement with LIV Golf, one of the most important golf tours in the world.

Enhance the Governance of National Sports Associations and Strengthen Support for Athletes

204. The review of the provision of direct financial support for elite athletes has been recently completed. The Government will continue to provide financial support for athletes so that they can concentrate on their training within a more financially stable context. Training efficacy will be enhanced by capitalising on the R&D outcomes of sports medicine.

205. The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China will prioritise collaboration with NSAs that have relatively established governance frameworks, expedite the implementation of the Code of Governance and establish a governance paradigm. The Government will strive to support Asian or international sports associations to establish presence in Hong Kong through NSAs, while encouraging NSAs to participate in the work of these associations to strengthen the city's international voice and influence.

Promote the Integrated Development of Education, Technology and Talents

134. The integrated development of education, technology and talents is a foundational and strategic pillar for progress in the new era. It enables Hong Kong to build rich talent resources, knowledge reserve, and capacities for scientific and technological innovation, thereby enhancing our competitiveness.

(A) Build an International Education Hub

135. With a distinctive competitive edge in post-secondary education, Hong Kong is the only city worldwide that hosts five universities ranked among the world's top 100. We will accelerate construction of the Northern Metropolis University Town, promote the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand, develop universities of applied sciences (UASs), and propel our city towards becoming an international hub for post-secondary education and high-calibre talents.

136. We are committed to enhancing the quality of education in Hong Kong, fostering the all-round development of students, and providing more diverse, high-quality learning opportunities and experiences to nurture a broad pool of competent and knowledgeable talents. Hong Kong boasts a high-quality primary and secondary education system that offers diversified curricula and is highly competitive on the global stage. The Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (DSE) has been recognised by 1 100 higher education institutions worldwide. We will intensify our efforts to promote the DSE's international recognition, attract more outstanding teachers and students from around the world to come to Hong Kong, and support the development of international schools. We will also continually enhance the professional standards of teachers and the quality of programmes, while strengthening digital and technology education.

Post-secondary Institutions

Relax Restrictions on Admission of Self-financing Students

137. Universities in Hong Kong are highly popular, with a double-digit year-on-year increase in the number of self-financing non-local applicants. The Government currently provides 15 000 funded places for local students. This number will not be reduced, ensuring the current enrolment situation of local students in subsidised programmes remains unchanged. On the other hand, the number of non-funded places for non-local students to study in Hong Kong on a self-financing basis will be permitted to increase. Starting from the 2026/27 academic year, the enrolment ceiling for self-financing non-local students of each funded post-secondary institution will be raised from the level currently equivalent to 40% of local student places to 50%; and the over-enrolment ceiling of self-financing places of funded research postgraduate programmes will be increased from 100% to 120%.

Increase Student Hostel Supply

138. The Government launched the Hostels in the City Scheme in July to facilitate the market in converting existing commercial buildings (including hotels) into student hostels by obviating the need for rezoning and allowing excessive plot ratio be retained. Effective today, apart from cases involving the conversion of commercial buildings, cases involving redevelopment of original commercial buildings into new student hostels can also enjoy the facilitation measures under the scheme, including retaining excessive plot ratio. The Government will also earmark new sites (zoned as commercial or otherwise) this year for building new hostels, and will invite the market to submit expressions of interest.

Attract More International Teaching and Research Talents and Students

139. The EDB will establish the Task Force on Study in Hong Kong, bringing together the University Grants Committee (UGC), the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB), the Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE), post-secondary institutions, ETOs, the Mainland Offices etc. to step up the promotion of higher education in Hong Kong. Relevant measures include:

(i) Roll out the ""Hong Kong: Your World-class Campus"" large-scale publicity campaign to promote Hong Kong's quality resources in areas such as academic studies, scientific research and international co-operation.

(ii) Provide funding support of $40 million by the UGC for the eight funded universities to enhance publicity, as well as teacher and student recruitment overseas and in the Mainland. The EDB will also take the lead in encouraging post-secondary institutions to organise more summer study tours to attract non-local senior secondary school students.

(iii) Encourage post-secondary institutions to roll out more high value-added ""Study Tour in Hong Kong"" activities to promote the ""Study Tour in Hong Kong"" brand.

Advance the Development of Universities of Applied Sciences

140. The Government has granted the UAS designation to two universities, putting into practice the principle that ""every trade has its masters"". We will encourage UASs to deepen collaboration with leading enterprises in the Mainland and overseas, fostering industry-education collaboration and joint promotion. The Alliance of UASs in Hong Kong will explore the feasibility of co-operating with leading polytechnic institutions in Guangdong Province to jointly establish a GBA exchange platform.

Implement the Arrangement on Mutual Recognition of Vocational and Professional Qualifications with the Mainland

141. We will continue exploring with Mainland authorities the implementation of the mutual recognition of sub-degree level qualifications between Hong Kong and the Mainland. This aims to facilitate cross-boundary job-seeking and the pursuit of further studies by graduates of vocational and professional programmes in both places.

Primary and Secondary Schools

Allow Schools under the Direct Subsidy Scheme to Apply for Increasing the Number of Non-local Students

142. The EDB will, on a trial basis, allow schools under the Direct Subsidy Scheme to apply for increasing the number and size of classes, expanding their intake of non-local students with student visas to study on a self-financing mode.

Promote the International Recognition of the Diploma of Secondary Education Examination

143. We will promote the international recognition of the DSE to various sectors through a range of education exhibitions and activities overseas and on the Mainland, enabling DSE candidates to have more options for further education.

144. The EDB will strengthen efforts to crack down on the unauthorised provision of DSE programmes or the operation of ""shell schools"". We have set up a reporting mechanism, conducted unannounced inspections, and further clarified the registration arrangements for private candidates taking the DSE in the coming year. In addition, we will formulate the Code of Practice for Private Schools and publish the Private School List within this year, with a view to improving the standards of school operation.

Develop International Schools

145. The EDB has allocated two vacant school premises for international school development. The Government has also reserved sites in the Northern Metropolis for the development of international schools.

146. We encourage international schools to increase their admission quotas. We will also remove barriers and ease restrictions, allowing quality international schools to build new facilities and enhance existing ones, including student boarding facilities, at their school sites on a self-financing basis.

Promote Digital Education

147. The EDB has set aside $2 billion in the Quality Education Fund (QEF) to support digital education in primary and secondary schools and will release the Blueprint for Digital Education in Primary and Secondary Schools in 2026. This will encompass strategies such as optimising the interface between primary and secondary curricula of Information Technology and I&T education, setting out an ""AI literacy"" learning framework, incorporating AI education into the core curriculum, enhancing AI training for teachers, and introducing corporate resources.

Enhance the Quality of Teaching and Learning

148. The QEF will introduce a new stage of the dedicated funding programme for publicly-funded schools, under which the cumulative funding ceiling for publicly-funded schools and eligible kindergartens will be raised to enhance the quality of education. Schools will also be encouraged to strengthen promotion in areas such as values education, financial education and entrepreneurial spirit through various funding programmes.

(B) International Innovation and Technology Centre

149. With tremendous potential in technology development, Hong Kong ranks third globally in ""Technology"", in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster ranks first in the 2025 Global Innovation Index Ranking of the World's Top 100 Innovation Clusters. With three major I&T parks and five key R&D institutions as the framework, we will propel I&T development, pool global talents and make full use of Hong Kong's R&D platform to support the development of aerospace science and technology. We will also promote the development of new industrialisation, press ahead with the low-altitude economy, support people-oriented scientific research, and facilitate leading I&T enterprises to establish a presence in our city.

Improve the Strategic Layout of Innovation and Technology Infrastructure

150. The ITIB is taking forward the set-up of two pilot lines by the Hong Kong Microelectronics Research and Development Institute. Preparatory work for the establishment of the Life and Health Technology Research Institutes and the Hong Kong Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute will be completed within next year.

Accelerate the Development of New Industrialisation

151. The Government (the ITIB) will provide industry-ready use cases and adopt the ""scenario-based investment promotion"" approach. It will also facilitate leading or influential I&T companies to develop businesses in Hong Kong. Relevant measures include:

(i) Expedite the development of the third InnoHK research cluster, with the focus on sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing and materials. The R&D centres under the cluster will be established in the first half of 2026.

(ii) Relax the application threshold for the New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme by lowering the minimum total project cost from $300 million to $150 million and providing funding on a matching basis for the employment of relevant technical personnel, encouraging the establishment of more smart production facilities. We will also consider providing necessary support measures for individual enterprises.

(iii) Launch the I&T Industry-Oriented Fund in 2026-27. The Government will endeavour to channel market capital to invest in emerging and future industries of strategic importance.

Support People-oriented Scientific Research

152. During my visit to Hangzhou's ""Six Little Dragons"" in Zhejiang, I was aware of a new technology that enables a breakthrough benefitting people with amputations. Prostheses incorporating new R&D technologies are embedded with sensors that can detect neural signals transmitted from muscles to control prosthetic movements without having to implant any device or wiring. With some training, wearers of these prostheses are able to perform daily activities such as writing or playing musical instruments. The Government will support people-oriented scientific research through the Innovation and Technology Fund to introduce prostheses built with new R&D technologies. A two-year scheme will be introduced to grant full subsidies to amputees in Hong Kong for the configuration and use of the high-tech prostheses free of charge, enabling them to benefit from new technologies.

Promote the Development of a Low-altitude Economy Ecosystem

153. The Government will forge ahead with building a competitive low-altitude economy ecosystem, to propel Hong Kong as an Asia-Pacific hub for innovative low-altitude applications.

Formulate an Action Plan

154. We will formulate the Action Plan on Developing Low Altitude Economy to advance Hong Kong as a major hub for low-altitude applications through institutional innovations and technological breakthroughs. Relevant measures include:

(i) Improve civil aviation legislation and regulatory framework, including formulating dedicated legislation for unconventional aircraft weighing over 150 kilograms, to lay the foundation for developing the standardisation of the low-altitude economy.

(ii) Enhance core infrastructure facilities by designating spectrum by the end of the year, as well as facilitating early planning and deployment of facilities such as vertiports, air route networks, satellite positioning, three-dimensional spatial data systems and a smart, low-altitude traffic-management system.

155. We will further encourage higher education institutions and enterprises to make use of existing funding schemes to promote relevant R&D and its applications, review relevant talent development, and support the industry and universities in organising more training to promote the low-altitude economy. Last year, InvestHK hosted the inaugural Hong Kong Low Altitude Economy Forum, attracting over 250 local and overseas industry stakeholders. We will continue to encourage the hosting of flagship events to showcase the business opportunities of the low-altitude economy and an innovative, efficient and secure low-altitude economy ecosystem.

Enhance the Regulatory Sandbox

156. The first batch of Regulatory Sandbox pilot projects was announced in March. We will regularise the operation of more mature application scenarios, and roll out the advanced low-altitude economy ""Regulatory Sandbox X"" pilot projects to cover application scenarios that are technically more complex, such as cross-boundary routes and passenger-carrying, low-altitude aircraft.

Develop Low altitude Economy Insurance Products

157. The insurance industry has set up a task force to develop low-altitude economy insurance products for various application scenarios, drawing reference from the data of the Government's Regulatory Sandbox. The IA will forge closer ties with the industry to meet demands.

Promote the Development of Aerospace Science and Technology and Support Space Economy

158. Our country has designated commercial aerospace as a strategic emerging industry. Hong Kong has an advantage in internationalisation and possesses strong scientific research capabilities, with various universities participating in national aerospace projects. This, coupled with our financing advantages, allows us to promote the development of aerospace science and technology, supporting the space economy.

159. The Government has set up the Hong Kong Space Robotics and Energy Centre under the InnoHK research clusters to support our country's Chang'E-8 mission. The Innovation and Technology Support Programme Special Call on Aerospace Technology has allocated over $100 million to support six university R&D projects. In parallel, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) is exploring how to streamline the vetting of licence applications for Low Earth Orbit satellites and will promote 6G application. The HKIC will also pursue investment in areas related to commercial aerospace and the space economy.

(C) Regional Intellectual Property Trading Centre

Promote Intellectual Property Trading

160. Intellectual property (IP) is a legally protected intangible asset and the cornerstone of encouraging I&T development and creativity. Hong Kong ranks sixth globally on the criterion for ""intellectual property rights"", an improvement of six places since the current-term Government took office. We will push forward measures in IP financing, valuation and protection, and strengthen external promotion to boost IP trading.

Bolster Intellectual Property Financing

161. The CEDB and the Intellectual Property Department (IPD) will collaborate with the HKMA to launch an IP financing sandbox to assist pilot sectors (particularly the technology sector) in leveraging IPs for financing with the support of the banking, insurance, valuation, legal and other professions.

Patent Valuation Services and Subsidies

162. Upon the official operation of the Hong Kong Technology and Innovation Support Centre, by the end of this year, the Government will support the centre in providing local small and medium I&T enterprises with patent evaluation based on national standards, and launching a two-year pilot programme to subsidise patent valuation as a reference for credit financing.

Protect Intellectual Property Rights

163. Following the completion of the public consultation on enhancement of the Copyright Ordinance regarding the protection for AI technology development in September last year, the Government will formulate a code of practice in respect of relevant legal principles and prepare a legislative proposal. We are also reviewing the local registered designs regime for consultation by the end of the year.

External Promotion

164. The Government and the HKTDC will promote IP financing in the Business of IP Asia Forum 2025. The IPD will also nominate local enterprises to compete for the China Patent Award jointly organised by the China National Intellectual Property Administration and the World Intellectual Property Organization.

(D) Nurture Talents

165. The Government attaches great importance to youth development. We will enhance the talent policy to attract technical professionals with specified skills to Hong Kong, promote the flow of talents between the industry and academic sectors, and strengthen the HKTE's efforts in talent attraction and support. This will help build Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talents.

Promote Youth Development

Youth Training and Development

166. To better equip our young people, broaden their international horizons and cultivate a holistic outlook, we will launch a Young Talent Training Programme. We will provide more opportunities for young people to participate in the internships of international organisations and attend international conferences. We will also introduce a new media thematic internship programme in the Mainland, strengthen the Youth Financial Education Programme, and launch new mediation workshops to enhance young people's understanding of the mediation industry.

Facilitate International and Mainland Exchanges for Local Youths

167. The HYAB will continue to implement the HYAB Funding Scheme for Youth Exchange in the Mainland and the HYAB Funding Scheme for International Youth Exchange, and encourage young people from the Mainland and overseas to visit Hong Kong on exchange. In addition, the eight youth uniformed groups of the Security Bureau's disciplined and auxiliary services departments will proactively organise international and Mainland exchange activities.

Foster Diverse Exchanges and Experiences through the Youth Post

168. The Youth Post hostel¹â° , converted from the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility, has commenced operation on a trial basis and will officially open this year. Along with providing affordable accommodation for young people from the Mainland and overseas, the Youth Post plans to organise about 100 youth activities of different types encompassing culture, arts, sports and other elements in its five year operation period, promoting exchanges between young visitors and Hong Kong youth.

Provide More Interactive Spaces for Young People

169. The first phase of the renovation work of the new interactive space for young people at Youth Square in Chai Wan, and the physical platform for interaction for Youth Link members in Nam Cheong, will be completed by the end of this year, providing venues for young people to expand their networks.
Develop a Talent Pool

Talent Admission Policies

170. Since the implementation of an array of new talent admission policies by the current-term Government, over 230 000 people have come to Hong Kong for work and development. Among the various schemes, the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) has recorded an application rate as high as 55% for extension of stay. TTPS talents granted an extension of stay are of high-calibre. They are mainly employed in the I&T and financial sectors in Hong Kong. Of them, 95% receive a monthly income higher than the local median income of about $20,000, and 50% earn a monthly income nearly double that amount. This reflects a strong demand for TTPS talents and the market's willingness to offer higher salaries to attract them. The TTPS contributes about $34 billion a year to the local economy, equivalent to approximately 1.2% of our GDP.

171. The majority of talents admitted to Hong Kong under the various schemes are very young, with 70% of them under the age of 40, helping ease the challenges of an ageing population.

172. Hong Kong's ranking in relation to global talents is rising steadily, climbing 12 places in two years to the fourth place globally this year, ranking first in the Asia Pacific region. This reflects that our talent policy is on the right track and effective, and is one of the important driving forces for economic development. The Government will continue to implement talent policies to ensure our long-term competitiveness to drive sustained economic growth.

Strengthen Talent Exchanges among the Industry, Academic and Research Sectors

173. The Government will launch the Innovation and Technology Talents Exchange Scheme for Industry and Academic Sectors, encouraging university professors to engage in corporate R&D activities for a better grasp of industry needs. Senior management of technology enterprises and technical experts will also be invited to teach and help develop curriculum, strengthening the collaborative development of our industry, academic and research sectors.

​行政長官向立法會發表《行政長官2025年施政報告》發言全文（七）,2025-09-17 12:18,2025-09-17 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/17/P2025091700257.htm,"三、國際航運中心

113. 香港是全球最繁忙港口之一，亦是世界首屈一指清關快和效率高的「補時港」⁹，擁有逾1 200家企業的海運服務圈，是全球第四國際航運中心。政府會擴展跨省貨運網路、建立大宗商品生態圈、推動港口綠色化和數字化、提升高增值海運服務優勢。

建立通達內陸「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系

114. 我們正積極拓展貨源，推動來自內地內陸省市的貨物沿鐵（路）、海（路）、陸（路）和江（河）的多式聯運，經香港運往國際市場。現時，重慶和成都的貨物已經循鐵海聯運，經深圳鹽田港或廣西北部灣，再分別以駁船或「天天班」班輪服務轉運至葵青港上船，充分發揮港口之間優勢互補，並達致互惠共贏。

建立國際「伙伴港口」網絡

115. 政府將與內地具戰略合作意義及「一帶一路」地區建立「伙伴港口」關係，並為建立綠色航運走廊作準備。

打造綠色船用燃料加注中心

116. 我們將聚焦發展綠色甲醇、綠氨和氫氣等燃料，包括今年內邀請業界就發展綠色船用燃料貯存設施提交意向書、明年內開始要求所有在香港水域用於甲醇加注的船舶須安裝質量流量計，提升加注效率，以及開展綠氨和氫氣加注可行性研究。

117. 政府亦會促成更多綠色船用燃料在香港交易，以及協助內地綠色船用燃料出口。

構建數字化港口系統

118. 港口社區系統將於明年1月推出，提供貨物追蹤功能，並聯通海、陸、空運輸網絡，數字化打通貿易流和資金流。

加大發揮高增值海運服務優勢

119. 香港船東擁有、管理或營運的商船共佔全球近一成載重噸位。船舶在港註冊受本港法律管轄和保障，其運作帶動香港高增值海運服務業發展，包括船舶管理、船舶租賃、海事保險、海事法律及仲裁等。

120. 為加強香港在高增值海運服務的領先地位，政府明年會修訂《商船（註冊）條例》，增加註冊靈活性和加強電子化等，並加大推廣稅務優惠、擴大海事保險業務。政府和保險業監管局（保監局）亦正推動業界建立航運專項風險池，提升香港對本地和內地市場承保的能力。

推進海運長遠發展策略

121. 香港海運港口發展局已於今年7月成立，協助政府制訂更外向、更全面的國際和內地推廣策略，以及航運業的整體發展政策，鎖定重點領域展開研究。

支持現代物流業發展

122. 為鞏固香港國際物流樞紐地位，我們今年內會公布洪水橋╱厦村新發展區發展現代物流圈的規劃研究結果。明年將邀請業界提交發展意向書及制訂招標條款。

四、國際航空樞紐

123. 香港連接全球超過200個航點，過去兩年客貨運的航班數量提升了超過60%。我們繼續把握機場三跑道系統的新機遇，增加長途及中轉航線，鞏固全球貨運第一和大灣區中轉樞紐的優勢。

加速擴展航空版圖

124. 過去兩年，香港與十多個民航夥伴擴大了雙邊民航安排，往來澳洲和土耳其的航班隨即增加。我們上月與智利達成共識，為訂立新民航協議打下基礎；未來會積極吸引本地及非本地航空公司開辦更多航班，爭取訂立更多新民航協議及擴展航權，優先聚焦南美洲、中亞、非洲及中東等。

完善大灣區多式聯運網絡

125. 由10月起，我們會擴大飛機乘客離境稅的豁免範圍，涵蓋經水路和陸路來港轉機的乘客。機管局亦會擴展內地城市候機樓網絡，優化「經珠港飛」陸路連接，涵蓋更多內地城市。

推進擴大「機場城市」發展

126. 亞洲國際博覽館二期工程已啟動，預計於2028年落成。機管局明年初將就遊艇港灣及配套設施邀請發展意向書，預計2028年起分階段完成。機管局正同步建立藝術產業生態圈、開設空運鮮活市集等。

鞏固貨運全球第一優勢

127. 香港國際機場自2010年以來第14次獲得全球第一貨運機場的地位。機管局會發揮三跑道系統優勢，增加貨運量，同時推進位於東莞的空港中心建設，增加進出內地貨物使用香港空運服務。

五、國際法律及爭議解決服務中心

128. 香港法律制度健全，與國際高度接軌，是全球唯一實施中英雙語普通法制度的地方。我們會加強推廣香港法律服務，深化調解文化，強化香港國際法律樞紐及「調解之都」地位。

國際調解院總部開展運作

129. 國際調解院履行《聯合國憲章》規定以調解等和平方式維護國際和平與安全的使命，總部設於香港，反映中央政府對香港的重視和國際社會對香港發展的信心，亦鞏固香港作為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的定位。

130. 政府會全力支持國際調解院的工作，並會積極舉辦國際會議、專業培訓、實習計劃等，爭取香港青年和法律人才參與和服務國際調解院的工作，為香港培育更多國際調解人才。

國際法律樞紐

131. 律政司會在國際調解院總部旁興建香港國際法律事務大樓，匯聚香港國際法律人才培訓學院總部和國際法律及爭議解決服務機構等設施。

加強推廣香港法律服務

132. 律政司副司長專責推廣香港法律服務，協同其他專業服務如會計、金融等，支援內地企業出海需要。

調解文化及仲裁發展

133. 政府會持續推動「體育爭議解決先導計劃」和「社區調解先導計劃」，同時強化規範調解專業的認證和紀律制度。政府亦會加強推廣香港的仲裁服務，及研究是否需要對《仲裁條例》作出修訂。

113. Hong Kong is one of the busiest ports in the world. Being a leading ""catch-up port""â¹ renowned for its fast customs clearance and high efficiency, underpinned by a maritime service ecosystem with more than 1 200 companies, Hong Kong is ranked fourth among the world's international shipping centres. The Government will expand the cross-provincial freight transport network, build a commodity ecosystem, drive the port's green transformation and digitalisation, and better harness our advantages in high value-added maritime services.

Establish a Comprehensive ""Rail-sea-land-river"" Intermodal Transport System Connecting to the Inland Region

114. We are actively extending Hong Kong's cargo sources, promoting intermodal cargo transport from the Mainland's inland provinces and cities to international markets through Hong Kong via rail, sea, land and river. Currently, cargo originating from Chongqing and Chengdu can be sent by sea-rail intermodal service to Yantian Port in Shenzhen or Beibu Gulf in Guangxi, then transhipped to the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals by feeders or daily liner service. This fully leverages the complementary strengths of the ports concerned, achieving mutual benefits.

Build an International ""Partner Port"" Network

115. The Government will establish ""partner port"" relationships with Mainland regions of strategic collaboration significance, as well as B&R regions, and prepare for the development of a green shipping corridor.

Develop a Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering Centre

116. We will focus on the development of bunkering of fuels such as green methanol, green ammonia and hydrogen. Later this year, we will invite the industry to submit expressions of interest in the development of green maritime fuel storage facilities. We will also require all vessels providing methanol bunkering services in Hong Kong waters to install mass flow meters to improve bunkering efficiency within next year, and initiate a feasibility study on green ammonia and hydrogen bunkering.

117. The Government will facilitate the trading of more green maritime fuels in Hong Kong, and assist in the export of Mainland-produced green maritime fuel.

Develop a Digitalised Port System

118. The Port Community System, to be launched in January next year, will provide cargo tracking function and connect sea, land and air transport networks, bolstering trade and capital flows digitally.

Better Harness the Strengths of High Value-added Maritime Services

119. Vessels owned, managed or operated by Hong Kong shipowners account for nearly 10% of the deadweight tonnage of the world's merchant fleet. Ships registered in Hong Kong are governed and protected by local law. Their operation will drive the development of high value-added maritime services, including ship management, ship leasing, marine insurance, maritime law and arbitration.

120. To strengthen Hong Kong's leading position in high value-added maritime services, the Government will amend the Merchant Shipping (Registration) Ordinance next year to render the registration processes more flexible and digitalised. We will also step up promotion of tax concessions and enhance the marine insurance business. The Government and the Insurance Authority(IA) are engaging the industry in establishing a dedicated marine risk pool to enhance Hong Kong's underwriting capacity for both local and Mainland markets.

Propel Long-term Maritime Development Strategies

121. The Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board, established in July this year, assists the Government in formulating more outgoing and comprehensive overseas and Mainland promotional strategies, as well as policies for the overall development of the maritime industry, with key areas identified for research.
Support Modern Logistics Development

122. To consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international logistics hub, we will release the findings of the planning study on the development of modern logistics clusters in Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA this year. We will invite expressions of interest from the industry next year and draw up tender conditions.

(D) International Aviation Hub

123. Connecting with more than 200 destinations worldwide, Hong Kong saw an increase of over 60% in the number of passenger and cargo flights over the past two years. We will continue to leverage the opportunities brought by the Three-Runway System at the HKIA and increase the number of long-haul and transit routes, reinforcing Hong Kong's top global ranking for cargo throughput and our advantages of being the GBA's transit hub.

Accelerate the Expansion of Aviation Network

124. Over the past two years, Hong Kong has expanded bilateral air services arrangements with more than 10 aviation partners, leading to an increase in flights to and from Australia and Turkey. We also reached a consensus with Chile last month, laying the foundation to establish a new air services agreement. We will encourage local and non-local airlines to operate more flights and work to forge more new air services agreements and expand traffic rights with South America, Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East as our priority target regions.
Improve the Greater Bay Area's Intermodal Network

125. Starting in October, we will expand exemptions from the Air Passenger Departure Tax to include passengers travelling to Hong Kong for transit by sea or land. The AAHK will also expand the city terminal network in the Mainland, and improve land transport connections under ""Fly-Via-Zhuhai-Hong Kong"", extending the service to more Mainland cities.

Take Forward the Expansion of Airport City Development

126. The construction of AsiaWorld-Expo Phase 2 has begun and is expected to be completed in 2028. The AAHK will invite expressions of interest in the development of a yacht bay and its ancillary facilities early next year. The facilities will be completed in phases, starting in 2028. The AAHK is also working on the creation of an ecosystem for the arts industry, the opening of a jet fresh market for fresh gourmet products and more.

Consolidate Hong Kong's Position as the World's Top Cargo Hub

127. The HKIA has been ranked the world's busiest cargo airport for the 14th time since 2010. The AAHK will continue to leverage the advantages of the Three-Runway System to increase cargo throughput. In parallel, it is moving ahead with the construction of a logistics park in Dongguan, to help boost the use of Hong Kong air cargo services for transporting goods to and from the Mainland.

(E) International Legal and Dispute Resolution Services Centre

128. Hong Kong maintains a robust legal system highly aligned with international standards, and is also the only place in the world implementing a bilingual common law system in both Chinese and English. We will step up the promotion of legal services in Hong Kong and deepen our mediation culture, reinforcing our positions as an international legal hub and the Capital of Mediation.

Commence Operation of the International Organization for Mediation's Headquarters

129. The International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) fulfils the mission of using mediation as one of the peaceful means to maintain international peace and security, as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations. Headquartered in Hong Kong, it reflects the importance the Central Government attaches to Hong Kong and the confidence of the global community in the city's development. It will also strengthen Hong Kong's positioning as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services.

130. The Government fully supports the work of the IOMed, and will organise international conferences, professional training, internships and other programmes to help Hong Kong young people and legal professionals work with the IOMed, nurturing more international mediation professionals for Hong Kong.
International Legal Hub

131. The DoJ will construct the Hong Kong International Legal Service Building adjacent to the IOMed headquarters. The building will house facilities such as the headquarters of the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy, as well as international legal and dispute resolution services institutions.
Strengthen the Promotion of Hong Kong Legal Services

132. The Deputy Secretary for Justice is tasked to promote Hong Kong's legal services and will collaborate with other professional service sectors, such as accounting and finance, to support Mainland enterprises wishing to expand overseas.

Mediation Culture and Arbitration Development

133. The Government will continue to take forward the Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution and the Pilot Scheme on Community Mediation. It will also strengthen the accreditation and disciplinary systems for the mediation profession, and step up promotion of Hong Kong's arbitration services, while studying the need to amend the Arbitration Ordinance.

90. 香港背靠國家、聯通世界，是享譽全球的國際金融、貿易和航運中心，亦是國際航空樞紐和國際法律及爭議解決服務中心。政府會全力發揮香港制度優勢，鞏固國際中心地位。

一、國際金融中心

91. 政府不斷強化香港金融體系，令香港在《全球金融中心指數》排名重回全球第三。我們會把握世界投資者重新配置資產機遇，鞏固國際金融中心地位；持續強化股票市場，構建國際領先的債券市場及蓬勃的貨幣市場，促進保險業與資產及財富管理業發展；並加速發展新增長點，建立國際黃金交易市場，推動金融科技和綠色可持續金融發展。

持續強化股票市場

92. 本港股票市場保持強勁，恒生指數自年初已上升逾兩成，每日平均成交額接近2,500億元，較去年接近翻倍。新股集資額至八月底累計逾1,300億元，按年多近六倍，位列全球第一。

93. 我們會透過「科企專線」協助內地科技企業來港融資，加強對國家建設科技強國的金融支持；進一步完善主板上市和結構性產品發行機制；研究優化「同股不同權」上市規定；探索縮短股票結算周期至T+1；推動更多海外企業來港第二上市；協助中概股以香港為首選回歸地；推動港股人民幣交易櫃台納入「股票通」南向交易。

構建國際領先債券市場

94. 政府會推進鞏固香港債券中心地位，包括：

(i) 提升金融基建，包括金管局旗下的迅清結算（CMU OmniClear）將與港交所合作，研究讓投資者在單一平台集中管理及相互抵押股票和債券等不同資產，促成不同「互聯互通」機制的聯動；亦會與瑞士、阿聯酋等地市場建立連接；並推動使用離岸中國國債作為不同清算所抵押品，進一步豐富人民幣資產的應用場景。證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）亦正研究由市場建立和營運的債券電子化交易平台的可行性，並積極推動在香港建立商業回購市場和中央交易對手制度以提升市場流動性。

(ii) 繼續與內地相關機構商討落實在港推出離岸國債期貨，擴充互換通下利率衍生品種類，並推動場外衍生工具的發展，以及與內地適時推出跨境人民幣回購業務。

(iii) 證監會、金管局及港交所將增加市場接觸，鼓勵更多企業在港發債，使更多環球資金參與香港債券市場。

(iv) 證監會和金管局將公布「固定收益及貨幣」路線圖闡述相關細節。

構建蓬勃貨幣市場

95. 香港是全球最大離岸人民幣業務樞紐。為增加香港離岸人民幣市場的流動性和全球輻射能力，金管局將利用與人民銀行的貨幣互換協議，設立新的「人民幣業務資金安排」，向企業提供貿易、日常營運、資本支出所需且年期較長的人民幣融資，支持實體經濟使用人民幣，並持續探討更多元化的跨境資金獲取渠道，為市場提供穩定且成本較低的人民幣資金。金管局亦會研究推動人民幣與區內本幣在港進行更便利的外匯報價與交易。

96. 政府將發行更多人民幣債券，並將研究在合適的場景下以人民幣支付政府開支。

加速建立國際黃金交易市場

97. 我已接納「推動黃金市場發展工作小組」的建議，由財庫局落實，包括：

(i) 推動香港機場管理局（機管局）及金融機構在港拓展黃金倉儲，以三年超越2 000噸為目標，建造區域黃金儲備樞紐。

(ii) 推動金商在港建立或擴建精煉廠，並與內地研究在內地進行來料加工，精煉黃金後出口至香港作交易及交割用途。

(iii) 建立香港黃金中央清算系統，為國際標準黃金交易提供高效可信的清算服務，並邀請上海黃金交易所參與，為未來與內地市場互聯互通做好預備。

(iv) 豐富黃金投資工具，協助發行人發行黃金基金，支持開發新產品，如代幣化黃金投資產品。

(v) 支持業界成立黃金行業協會，建立與政府和監管機構的交流平台，加強推廣及吸引「一帶一路」客戶，強化人才培訓。

98. 上海黃金交易所國際板在港設立了首家境外交割倉庫，並已推出在港交割的全新合約。我們會持續推進滬港黃金市場合作。

國際風險管理中心

99. 為推動保險資金參與基建融資，政府明年將修訂法例，調低對投資基建的資本要求，對本地項目給予優惠；並推動香港專屬自保和再保險行業發展，以及促進市場推出更多跨境養老、跨境自駕和低空經濟等保險產品。

國際資產及財富管理中心

100. 未來幾年，香港預料將成為全球規模最大的跨境財富管理中心。「跨境理財通2.0」優化措施自去年2月啟動後，內地投資香港的財富產品戶口由2.5萬個增至11萬個。

101. 我們會進一步優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠稅制，吸引更多基金來港落戶；證監會積極推動房地產投資信託基金（房託基金）納入「互聯互通」標的，提高兩地房託基金流動性；亦會配合優化合格境外有限合伙人（QFLP）機制，特別是加強與前海和上海合作，為內地私募市場引進更多境外資金。港投公司會通過直接或共同投資，培育具潛力的本地私募及對沖基金機構。

102. 現時，「新資本投資者入境計劃」要求申請人在港投資不少於3,000萬元，其中房地產投資額（無論是住宅或非住宅）現最多只算入1,000萬元。我們會優化計劃，如購買非住宅物業，可算入額由1,000萬元提升至1,500萬元，物業成交價則仍不受限制；如購買住宅物業，可算入額維持1,000萬元，但可算入的住宅物業投資會放寬，成交價門檻由5,000萬元下調至3,000萬元。

穩健發展金融科技

103. 金管局會繼續推進Ensemble ⁷項目，包括推動商業銀行推出代幣化存款和推動真實代幣化資產交易，例如用代幣化存款結算代幣化貨幣市場基金；以及協助政府將代幣化債券發行恆常化，並通過監管沙盒鼓勵銀行加強風險管理。

104. 我們正落實穩定幣發行人制度，並就數字資產交易及託管服務的發牌制度制訂立法建議，證監會亦正研究在充分保障投資者的前提下，擴展可提供予專業投資者的數字資產產品和服務的類型；同時加強國際稅務合作，打擊跨境逃稅。證監會亦透過引入自動化匯報和數據監測工具，構建香港數字資產的風險防線。

綠色可持續金融發展

105. 港交所2022年推出國際碳交易平台Core Climate，是全球唯一以港元及人民幣結算自願碳信用的交易平台。未來會加強與大灣區碳市場的試點合作，試驗跨境交易結算路徑，共建區內碳市場生態圈。政府亦會聯同內地相關監管部門和機構，研究國家參與國際碳市場的相關事宜，包括設訂自願碳信用標準和方法，以及碳減排量的登記、交易、結算等。

二、國際貿易中心

106. 貿易是香港繼金融後第二大主要行業，貢獻15%本地生產總值（GDP），去年貿易額是GDP的3.6倍，位列全球第三，對外商品貿易總值亦強勁增長7.3%，證明國際市場對香港作為貿易中心的信心持續上升。

107. 地緣政治演變令原有供應鏈受破壞，我們會積極拓展新市場，推動數字貿易，支援中小企轉型升級。

深化國際經貿網絡

108. 香港與卡塔爾的投資協定談判已於今年中大致完成，未來會與沙特阿拉伯、孟加拉國、埃及及秘魯探討簽訂新投資協定。政府亦會繼續爭取盡早加入《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP），擴大經貿網絡。

109. 我會在今年成立吉隆坡經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦），深化於東盟及周邊國家的經貿推廣，並擴展經貿辦覆蓋範圍至拉丁美洲及中亞地區。

推動數字貿易

110. 政府會促進貿易數字化，降低成本和提升效率：

(i) 金管局年底前將制訂Cargoˣ⁸項目路線圖。目前正通過商業數據通、與機管局和港口社區系統試行以貨運物流數據，為銀行和中小企減低信貸成本及審批時間。

(ii) 金管局與上海市數據局等將在Ensemble項目探索跨境金融合作，研究如何應用代幣化電子提單；以及推進與商業數據通和Cargoˣ對接等，探索以貨運物流數據推動兩地貿易融資。

(iii) 增多一個物流商為「跨境快件清關便利安排」（CEFA）的額外試點，促進電商貨運效率。

(iv) 逐步擴大「貿易單一窗口」，涵蓋更多貿易文件，並與海關總署推進兩地「單一窗口」連接，探討將現行「一單兩報」安排擴展至其他貿易文件及運輸模式。政府亦會與東盟探討雙方「單一窗口」的連接。

(v) 政府將於明年就企業對企業的貿易文件電子化提出立法建議。

推動大宗商品交易

111. 我們會延續去年《施政報告》方向，推動發展香港大宗商品交易生態圈，包括：

(iv) 深化與廣州期貨交易所及內地其他大宗商品市場的聯通發展，助力國家大宗商品市場國際化。

112. 政府將成立「大宗商品策略委員會」，由財政司司長領導，匯聚業界代表，加強大宗商品政策的頂層設計和長遠策略制訂。

⁷Ensemble項目旨在支持香港代幣化市場的發展，通過沙盒試驗，讓業界參與者在實際業務場景中，探索如何透過區塊鏈技術，建立新一代金融基建。

⁸Cargoˣ為金管局推出的公私營合作項目，聚焦善用貨運物流數據簡化及優化貿易融資流程；構建數碼方案，以提升中小企獲取貿易融資的機會；及探索與國際數據夥伴對接，便利香港銀行的貿易融資用例。

Consolidate Hong Kong's Status as an International Hub

90. Backed by strong national support and a high degree of global connectivity, Hong Kong is recognised worldwide as an international centre in finance, trade and shipping, as well as in aviation, legal services and dispute resolution. The Government will fully leverage these institutional strengths to consolidate Hong Kong's status as a premier international hub.

(A) International Financial Centre

91. Through sustained efforts of the Government to strengthen our financial system, Hong Kong has reclaimed its third-place position in the Global Financial Centres Index ranking. Building on this momentum, we will harness the asset-reallocation wave of global investors to cement our status as an international financial centre. Our strategy will deepen the equity market, expand a world-class bond market and a vibrant currency market, while advancing the insurance, asset management and wealth management sectors. We will also expedite the development of new growth areas, building a premier international gold trading market, driving the development of fintech, as well as promoting green and sustainable finance.

Continuously Strengthen the Stock Market

92. The Hong Kong stock market has maintained its strong momentum. The Hang Seng Index has risen by over 20% year-to-date, while the average daily turnover has reached $250 billion, nearly double that of last year. At the end of August, the cumulative amount of funds raised through IPOs exceeded $130 billion, nearly six times higher than that of the same period last year, ranking Hong Kong first globally in IPO fundraising.

93. We will leverage the Technology Enterprises Channel to assist Mainland technology enterprises in raising funds in Hong Kong, strengthening financial support for our nation's development as a science and technology powerhouse. We will also optimise the regimes for listing on the Main Board and issuing structured products, consider enhancements to the listing requirements for companies with weighted voting right structures, explore shortening the stock settlement cycle to T+1, encourage more overseas enterprises to seek secondary listing in Hong Kong, support China Concept Stock companies to return from overseas markets, with Hong Kong as their preferred destination, and press ahead with the inclusion of an RMB trading counter under Stock Connect's Southbound trading for Hong Kong stocks.

Build a World-leading Bond Market

94. The Government will further consolidate Hong Kong's position as a bond market hub. Relevant measures include:

(i) Enhance financial infrastructure, including the collaboration between the HKMA's CMU OmniClear and the HKEX to explore centralised management and the cross-collateralisation of assets (such as shares and bonds) by investors on a single platform, with a view to fostering interplay between various mutual-market access mechanisms, establishing connections with markets such as Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates and promoting the use of offshore Chinese Government Bonds as collateral in different clearing houses to further enrich the use cases of RMB assets. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is also studying the feasibility of an innovative electronic bond-trading platform built and operated by market participants. It is also promoting the establishment of a commercial repo market and a central counterparty regime in Hong Kong to improve market liquidity.

(ii) Continue discussions with relevant Mainland institutions on introducing offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong, expand the variety of interest rate derivatives under Swap Connect, promote the development of over-the-counter derivatives, and explore the launch of the cross-boundary RMB repo business in collaboration with the Mainland in due course.

(iii) Step up market outreach efforts by the SFC, the HKMA and the HKEX to encourage more enterprises to issue corporate bonds in Hong Kong, attracting capital from around the globe to participate in our bond market.

(iv) The SFC and the HKMA will set out relevant details of these measures in the Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap to be published.

Build a Vibrant Currency Market

95. Hong Kong is the world's largest offshore RMB business hub. To enhance the liquidity and global reach of the offshore RMB market in Hong Kong, the HKMA will make use of the Currency Swap Agreement with the People's Bank of China and introduce an RMB Business Facility, providing enterprises with the longer-term RMB financing required for trade, daily operation and capital expenditure, so as to support the use of RMB in the real economy. It will also continue to explore diversified channels for cross boundary capital acquisition, so as to provide a stable source of RMB funds for the market at a relatively low cost. The HKMA will also explore measures to facilitate foreign exchange quotations and transactions between RMB and other regional currencies in Hong Kong.

96. The Government will issue more RMB bonds and consider settling government expenditure in RMB under suitable circumstances.

Expedite the Building of an International Gold Trading Market

97. I have accepted the recommendations of the Working Group on Promoting Gold Market Development. The FSTB will implement the relevant initiatives, including:

(i) Support the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) and financial institutions to establish Hong Kong's gold storage facilities, with a target gold storing capacity of over 2 000 tonnes in three years, propelling Hong Kong into a regional gold reserve hub.

(ii) Encourage gold traders to set up or expand refineries in Hong Kong, and explore with the Mainland the feasibility of processing supplied materials in the Mainland to produce refined gold for exporting to Hong Kong for trading and delivery.

(iii) Establish a central clearing system for gold in Hong Kong to provide efficient and reliable clearing services for transactions of gold in compliance with international standards, and invite the participation of the Shanghai Gold Exchange to prepare for mutual market access with the Mainland in the future.

(iv) Offer a greater variety of gold investment vehicles by assisting issuers in issuing gold funds, and support the development of new investment products such as tokenised gold.

(v) Support the setting up of a trade association for the gold industry, with a view to establishing an exchange platform with the Government and regulators, stepping up promotional efforts and attracting more B&R clients, while strengthening talent training.

98. The International Board of the Shanghai Gold Exchange has set up its first offshore delivery vault in Hong Kong and launched new contracts for delivery in Hong Kong. We will continue to promote co-operation between the gold markets of the two cities.

International Risk Management Centre

99. To encourage the participation of insurance funds in infrastructure financing, the Government will amend the legislation next year to lower capital requirements for infrastructure investment and provide concessions for local projects. We will also promote the development of exclusive captive and reinsurance business in Hong Kong, encouraging the market to introduce more insurance products such as those related to cross-boundary elderly care, cross-boundary driving and low-altitude economy.

International Asset and Wealth Management Centre

100. Hong Kong is expected to become the world's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre in the next few years. Following the launch of Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect 2.0 in February last year, the number of Mainland accounts investing in Hong Kong's wealth products has increased from 25 000 to 110 000.

101. We will further enhance the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and carried interest to attract more funds to establish a presence in Hong Kong. The SFC will actively promote the inclusion of real estate investment trusts (REITs) under mutual market access to increase the liquidity of REITs in the Mainland and Hong Kong. We will also facilitate the enhancement of the Qualified Foreign Limited Partnerships (QFLP) mechanism, in particular by collaborating with Qianhai and Shanghai to attract more foreign capital to the Mainland's private capital market. The HKIC will nurture local private equity and hedge fund institutions with good potential through direct or co investment.

102. Currently, applicants of the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme are required to invest at least $30 million in Hong Kong. Among such investments, the maximum amount of investment in real estate (both residential and non-residential) to be counted towards the scheme is $10 million. The scheme will be enhanced, raising the maximum amount of investment to be counted from $10 million to $15 million for the purchase of non residential properties with no transaction price threshold; as for the purchase of residential properties, the investment to be counted will continue to be capped at $10 million, but the transaction price threshold will be lowered from $50 million to $30 million.

Steady Development of Fintech

103. The HKMA will continue to take forward Project Ensembleâ·, including encouraging commercial banks to introduce tokenised deposits, and promoting live transactions of tokenised assets, such as the settlement of tokenised money market funds with tokenised deposits. It will also assist the Government in regularising the issuance of tokenised bonds, and encourage banks to strengthen risk management through the supervisory sandbox.

104. We are implementing a regime for stablecoin issuers and formulating legislative proposals regarding licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers. The SFC is studying the possibility of offering a wider range of digital asset products and services to professional investors with the prerequisite of sufficient investor protection in place. Meanwhile, we will step up international tax co-operation to tackle cross-border tax evasion. The SFC will also introduce automated reporting and data surveillance tools to build a line of defence against risks associated with digital assets in Hong Kong.

Development of Green and Sustainable Finance

105. In 2022, the HKEX launched Core Climate, an international carbon trading platform and the only voluntary carbon credit trading platform in the world offering settlement in Hong Kong dollars and RMB. In the future, we will deepen pilot co-operation with the GBA carbon market, testing the means of cross-border trade settlement, and jointly building a regional carbon market ecosystem. Working with relevant Mainland regulatory departments and authorities, the Government will also study issues surrounding the country's participation in the international carbon market, including the formulation of voluntary carbon credit standards and methods, as well as the registration, trading and settlement of carbon emission reduction.

(B) International Trade Centre

106. Trading is the second-largest industry in Hong Kong after finance, contributing 15% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Last year, the value of trade was 3.6 times that of the GDP, ranking third in the world. The total value of external merchandise trade also grew strongly by 7.3%, underlining the global market's confidence in Hong Kong as a trade centre.

107. As the evolving geopolitical landscape has disrupted existing supply chains, we will actively open up new markets, promote digital trade, and support the transformation and upgrading of SMEs.

Deepen International Economic and Trade Networks

108. Our investment agreement negotiations with Qatar largely concluded in mid-2025. We will explore the signing of new investment agreements with Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Egypt and Peru. The Government will also continue to seek accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to expand our economic and trade network.

109. I will establish an Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in Kuala Lumpur this year to deepen economic and trade promotion in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and neighbouring countries, and will also expand the ETO coverage to Latin America and Central Asia.

Promote Digital Trade

110. The Government will promote the digitalisation of trade to lower costs and improve efficiency. Relevant measures are as follows:

(i) The HKMA will develop a roadmap for Project CargoË£ â¸ by the end of the year. Through Commercial Data Interchange (CDI), and working with the AAHK and the Port Community System, the trial project will leverage cargo data to reduce credit costs and processing time for banks and SMEs.

(ii) The HKMA will explore cross-boundary financial collaboration with the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Data and other parties under Project Ensemble, such as the application of tokenised electronic bills of lading, as well as advancing connections with CDI and CargoË£ to facilitate trade finance with the use of cargo data.

(iii) A logistics provider will be recruited as an additional pilot participant of the Cross-boundary Express Cargo Clearance Facilitation Arrangement (CEFA) to enhance the efficiency of e-commerce shipment.

(iv) The Trade Single Window will be expanded progressively to cover more trade documents. In parallel, the Government, together with the Mainland's General Administration of Customs, will work to connect the single windows of Hong Kong and the Mainland, and explore the feasibility of extending the existing ""Single Submission for Dual Declaration"" Scheme to include other trade documents and transport modes. In addition, the Government will discuss the possibility of connecting the single windows with ASEAN.

(v) The Government will introduce a legislative proposal next year for the digitalisation of business-to-business trade documents.

Promote Commodity Trading

111. We will continue to follow the direction set out in the last Policy Address to foster the development of a commodity trading ecosystem in Hong Kong. Relevant measures include:

(i) Support the sector in setting up more approved warehouses, having obtained the approval of the London Metal Exchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the HKEX, on the establishment of eight delivery warehouses in Hong Kong.

(ii) Provide half-rate tax concessions for commodity traders to set up businesses in Hong Kong, driving demand for shipping and professional maritime services. Legislative amendments will be made in the first half of next year.

(iii) Enhance the process of international commodity trading through financial innovation, including testing the use of technologies like electronic bills of lading and tokenised deposit in a collaboration between the HKMA and Banco Central do Brazil to facilitate trade.

(iv) Deepen connections with the Guangzhou Futures Exchange and other commodity markets in the Mainland, contributing to the internationalisation of our country's commodity market.

112. The Government will set up the Strategic Committee on Commodities, led by the Financial Secretary. It will bring together industry representatives with the aim of strengthening the top-down design and long-term strategy of our commodity policy.

â·Project Ensemble seeks to support the development of the tokenisation market in Hong Kong. Through sandbox experiments, it allows industry participants to explore building the next-generation financial infrastructure with blockchain technology in actual business scenarios.

â¸Project CargoË£ is a public-private collaboration launched by the HKMA, focusing on leveraging cargo data to streamline and enhance trade finance processes; developing digital solutions to improve accessibility to trade finance for SMEs; and exploring connections with international data partners to facilitate the trade financing use case for banks in Hong Kong.

77. 國家作為全球第二大經濟體，貢獻全球經濟增長超過三分之一，是香港發展的最大機遇。我們會全面融入國家發展大局，把握粵港澳大灣區建設、高質量共建「一帶一路」等國家戰略。今年亦是國家「十五五」規劃的謀篇布局之年，我們會發揮香港獨特優勢貢獻國家，並深化國際交往合作，發揮「內聯外通」的功能，吸引更多企業利用香港平台「出海」，創造商機和經濟回報。

一、驅動「引進來、走出去」發揮「出海」平台作用

78. 全球對「中國製造」產品需求加大，去年中國對外直接投資衝破1萬億元人民幣，內地企業「出海」步伐明顯加快。

79. 內地企業的戰略重心已轉向積極開拓新興市場。政府會把握香港出口平台優勢，加大經濟新增長點。內地企業出海可在香港設立財資中心和區域總部，進行跨境結算、匯款和融資等；並聘用香港會計、法律等專業高增值供應鏈服務拓展海外市場；同時透過香港推廣優勢，對接環球買家，打造國際品牌。

80. 去年《施政報告》宣布將香港打造為「高增值供應鏈服務中心」，吸引更多企業進駐香港，壯大總部經濟。2024年外地駐港企業在香港共設有超過1 400間地區總部，其中逾300間來自內地。

81. 我會整合香港的外地辦事處，包括投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局（貿發局）和香港駐內地的辦事處，組成一站式平台，成立「內地企業出海專班」（「出海專班」），主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台「出海」。商務及經濟發展局（商經局）局長會督導「出海專班」工作及協調各政策局、部門和機構，為「出海」企業制訂多元方案，包括：

(i) 金管局會推動銀行業尤其內地銀行在港設立區域總部，利用香港優勢，輻射開拓東南亞和中東等地區市場，提供更全面的跨境金融方案。

(ii) 吸引更多內地企業在港設立財資中心，於2026年上半年完成研究優化稅務寬減措施。

(iii) 金管局和沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金（PIF）已簽署諒解備忘錄，創立達10億美元的新投資基金，用於香港和其他大灣區城市「出海」到沙特阿拉伯的企業。

(iv) 金管局會聯同香港銀行公會、香港總商會、香港工業總會等帶領銀行及中小企前往越南等東南亞市場拓展商機，匯聚業界力量支撐「出海」平台發展。

(v) 政府會充分發揮香港展覽業的優勢，鞏固香港作為內地品牌「走出去」和環球品牌「引進來」的最佳平台，同時支持業界舉行更多有利推動品牌發展的活動。

(vi) 推動碳排放核算服務發展，助力「出海」企業滿足國際對綠色貿易的減排要求和標準。

82. 政府會協助本地傳媒發展香港以外的網絡，說好「香港故事」。

二、深化國際交往合作

83. 我們會積極爭取亞洲基礎設施投資銀行在港設立辦事處。香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）亦會與東南亞的交易所深化合作，吸引更多東南亞發行人在香港第二上市，並鼓勵更多資產公司在當地發行產品便利配置香港市場。

84. 「一帶一路」辦公室會協調香港公營機構和學院，培訓共建「一帶一路」國家人士，並為香港專業服務業爭取更多機會配對「一帶一路」市場的商業項目。

85. 我們會支持國家推動共建「一帶一路」綠色合作，包括與「一帶一路」綠色發展國際聯盟共同建立「一帶一路」綠色發展香港合作平台。環境保護署會於2026年成立「一帶一路」可持續綠色發展培訓中心，在香港為共建「一帶一路」國家人員提供培訓課程，香港賽馬會將出資1億元作支持。我們亦會支持香港專業組織⁵把綠色建築評估工具推廣至「一帶一路」國家使用。

86. 政府將邀請「絲路海運」聯盟成員⁶於明年「香港海運週」舉辦高峰會，推廣共建「一帶一路」航運品牌。

87. 我們會於今明兩年相繼舉行「世界互聯網大會亞太峰會」和「香港國際創科展」、首屆「香港固定收益及貨幣論壇」、「國際刑警組織周年大會」、「粵港澳大灣區中醫藥傳承創新發展大會」、「國家及地區奧委會協會全體代表大會」、「亞太國際教育協會年會暨展覽」和首屆研究資助局「研究高峰會」。同時，成立「香港國際懲教應變戰術訓練學院」，進一步提升國際交流和專業培訓能力。政府支持本地大學及專業組織繼續積極爭取舉辦國際學術或專業會議，並籌辦具影響力的學術期刊；以及積極參與國際和地區組織以開展科技創新合作，例如國際標準化組織（ISO）等。

三、粵港澳大灣區建設

88. 香港是大灣區中心城市和區域發展核心引擎之一，在大灣區建設中肩負引領帶動的重任，在國家進一步改革開放中更具有不可替代的重要作用。政府會繼續帶領全社會更主動對接國家戰略、更積極融入國家發展大局，加強與廣東、澳門的互利合作，深化協同發展。

89. 我們將繼續深化粵港澳三地規則銜接和機制對接，提升人流、物流、數據流、資金流，包括：

(i) 推進「香港國際機場東莞空港中心」發展方面，內地貨物可在東莞完成安檢及收貨，使用水路直接運到香港國際機場上機，大大降低運作成本，是大灣區合作的最成功典範項目。第一期永久設施會在年底起分階段完成，第二期前期研究亦於今年展開，包括引入更多高增值物流和跨境電商設施。

(ii) 推動大灣區仲裁員名冊和大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，降低企業跨境糾紛解決成本。

Integrate into the Overall National Development

77. As the world's second-largest economy, our country contributes more than one-third of global economic growth, representing the greatest opportunity for Hong Kong's development. We will fully integrate into the overall national development, capitalising on national strategies such as the GBA and high-quality co-operation under the B&R Initiative. In addition, this year is the preparatory year for the national 15th Five-Year Plan. Leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages, we will contribute to the national development, and deepen international exchanges and co-operation by connecting with the Mainland and the world. We will also attract more enterprises to use Hong Kong to expand overseas, thereby creating business opportunities and economic returns.

(A) ""Bringing in and Going Global"": Hong Kong as a Platform for Overseas Expansion

78. China's external direct investment exceeded RMB 1 trillion last year, underscoring the growing global demand for ""Made in China"" products. Mainland enterprises are accelerating their pace to ""go global"".

79. With a shift in strategic focus, Mainland enterprises are proactively exploring emerging markets. The Government will capitalise on the advantages of Hong Kong as an export platform to unlock new areas for economic growth. Mainland enterprises going global can establish Corporate Treasury Centres (CTCs) and regional headquarters in Hong Kong for cross-boundary settlement, remittance, financing and related functions. They can also tap Hong Kong's professional high value-added supply chain services in fields such as accounting and law to help them explore overseas markets. In addition, they can leverage Hong Kong's strengths in marketing to connect with global buyers and build international brands.

80. In last year's Policy Address, I announced that we would develop Hong Kong into a high value-added supply chain service centre, attracting more enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong and expanding our headquarters economy. In 2024, Hong Kong was home to more than 1 400 regional headquarters of non-local enterprises, over 300 of which were from the Mainland.

81. I will establish a one-stop platform by mobilising Hong Kong's overseas offices, including those under InvestHK and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), as well as Hong Kong offices in the Mainland, and set up the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force) to encourage Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong in expanding their businesses overseas. The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development will steer the work of GoGlobal Task Force and co-ordinate various bureaux, departments and agencies in formulating proposals for enterprises looking to go global. Details are as follows:

(i) The HKMA will encourage the banking sector, especially banks in the Mainland, to establish regional headquarters in Hong Kong, where Hong Kong's strengths can help them expand into markets such as Southeast Asia and the Middle East, thereby providing more comprehensive cross-boundary financial solutions.

(ii) To attract more Mainland enterprises to establish CTCs in Hong Kong, we will complete a study on tax concessionary measures to be further enhanced in the first half of 2026.

(iii) The HKMA has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia to establish a US$1 billion new investment fund, catering to enterprises in Hong Kong and other GBA cities looking to expand into Saudi Arabia.

(iv) The HKMA will collaborate with organisations such as the Hong Kong Association of Banks, the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries to lead delegations of banking representatives and SMEs to explore business opportunities in Southeast Asian markets such as Vietnam, pooling industry strengths to support the ""going global"" platform.

(v) The Government will leverage the strengths of Hong Kong's exhibition industry and consolidate our position as the ideal platform for Mainland brands to ""go global"" and for ""bringing in"" brands from around the world. We will also support the trade to organise more events conducive to brand development.

(vi) We will promote the development of carbon audit services to assist enterprises going global to meet international requirements and standards on green trade in respect of carbon emission reduction.

82. The Government will assist the local media to expand their network beyond Hong Kong, telling the good stories of Hong Kong.

(B) Deepen International Exchanges and Co-operation

83. We will actively invite the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to set up an office in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) will also deepen co-operation with Southeast Asian exchanges, attracting Southeast Asian issuers to seek secondary listings in Hong Kong and encouraging asset management companies to issue products in their local markets, thereby spurring asset allocation in our market.

84. The Belt and Road Office will co-ordinate local public organisations and institutes to help train the personnel of B&R countries. It will also strive for more opportunities to match commercial projects in B&R markets with Hong Kong professional service sectors.

85. We support our country to promote the participation in green co-operation with B&R countries by, among other things, jointly setting up a B&R Green Development Co-operation Platform in Hong Kong with the B&R Initiative International Green Development Coalition. The Environmental Protection Department will set up a B&R sustainable green development training centre in Hong Kong in 2026, providing training courses for the personnel of B&R countries. The Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) will support the initiative with funding of $100 million. In addition, we will support local professional organisationsâµ to promote green building assessment tools among B&R countries.

86. The Government will invite members of the Silk Road Maritime Associationâ¶ to hold a summit during Hong Kong Maritime Week next year, promoting its participation in the B&R shipping brand.

87. This year and next, we will organise the World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit and InnoEX; the inaugural Hong Kong Fixed Income and Currency Forum; the INTERPOL General Assembly; the GBA Conference on Inheritance, Innovation and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine; the Association of National Olympic Committees General Assembly; the Asia-Pacific Association for International Education Conference and Exhibition; and the first Research Summit of the Research Grants Council. We will also establish the Hong Kong International Correctional Services Response Tactics Training Academy to enhance international exchanges and professional training. The Government will support local universities and professional organisations in their bids to host more international academic and professional conferences and publish influential academic journals. The Government will also participate in and promote I&T collaboration with various international and regional organisations, such as the International Organization for Standardization.

(C) Development of the Greater Bay Area

88. As one of its core cities, Hong Kong plays a vital role in driving the GBA's development. It also plays an irreplaceable part in our country's reform and opening up. The Government will continue to lead the entire community to dovetail with national strategies and integrate into the country's overall development in a more proactive manner. We will also strengthen mutually beneficial co-operation with Guangdong and Macao and deepen co-ordinated development.

89. We will continue to deepen our co-operation with Guangdong and Macao, forging closer convergence of our respective rules and mechanisms to enhance the flow of people, goods, data and capital. Relevant measures include:

(i) Develop the HKIA Dongguan Logistics Park. Upon security screening and cargo acceptance in Dongguan, Mainland cargo can be transported directly to the HKIA for transhipment, significantly reducing operating costs. This is the most successful model of GBA co-operation. Phase 1 development's permanent facilities will be completed in stages, starting from the end of this year. The preliminary study for Phase 2 development is also set to commence this year, including the introduction of more high value-added logistics and cross-boundary e-commerce facilities.

(ii) Promote a panel of GBA arbitrators and a platform for GBA commercial mediation and arbitration to lower enterprises' costs of cross-boundary dispute resolution.

(iii) Extend cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements with the governments of Guangdong and Macao, including two-way ambulance transfers and expansion to cover designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha.

(iv) Enhance Cross-boundary Credit Referencing and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong cross-boundary data validation platform to facilitate Hong Kong banks' credit assessment of Mainland residents and enterprises in Hong Kong.

(v) Continuously enhance the Payment Connect, expanding to use cases for remittance related to people's livelihood. The Government will improve disbursement arrangements for portable cash assistance next year, so that Hong Kong elderly recipients retiring in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces may opt to receive Government assistance directly through their bank accounts with designated Mainland banks.

(vi) Work with exchanges in the GBA to develop commodity trading, carbon trading and other businesses. The HKEX, a controlling shareholder of the Qianhai Mercantile Exchange, will continue to strengthen mutual co-operation for the development of the offshore spot soybean market. Core Climate, the carbon marketplace of the HKEX, will collaborate with pilot carbon markets in the GBA to explore cross-boundary trade settlements on a trial basis.

(vii) Boost collaboration between the HKIC and the Guangdong Government to help Hong Kong's enterprises with high technology content, such as biotech and health tech start-ups, to strengthen cross-border industry chain development. Nansha will be the key base for the first phase.

(viii) The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) is working with Shenzhen and Qianhai to promote digital finance development and support deeper integration of technology and finance between Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Measures are expected to be announced later this year.

âµThe Hong Kong Green Building Council and the BEAM Society.

â¶The Silk Road Maritime Association was co-founded in 2018 by three large enterprises, the China COSCO Shipping Group, the Fujian Provincial Communication Transportation Group and the Xiamen Port Holding Group. The association aims to build an international integrated logistics service focused on shipping and foster economic and trade co-operation and development of countries and regions along the Maritime Silk Road. To date, the association has more than 330 members, including shipping companies, port enterprises, logistics companies and trade establishments, as well as members from upstream and downstream industries such as finance, insurance and technology.

Industry Development and Reform

55. Industries are the cornerstone of economic development. The Government will leverage market forces through enhanced measures, such as flexible land grant arrangements, tax concessions, capital subsidies and talent grooming, so as to drive industry development.

56. The service industry accounts for a significant share of our economy. In response to an increasingly dynamic market environment and rapid technological change, the Government will pursue structural upgrades of our industries. We will consolidate our traditional strengths in sectors such as financial and legal services, while actively nurturing emerging ones, including advanced manufacturing, life and health technology, new energy, AI and data science, to create more high-quality job opportunities, increasing people's income and enhancing overall economic efficiency.

(A) Formulate Preferential Policy Packages to Attract More Enterprises

57. The Financial Secretary will lead the relevant policy bureaux, departments, and public organisations in formulating packages of preferential policies including land grants, land premiums, financial subsidies, and tax incentives, to attract high value-added industries and high-potential enterprises to set up in Hong Kong, thereby promoting high-quality development.

58. The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises and Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) can use the policy packages flexibly during negotiations with enterprises on settlement details, then report to the Financial Secretary for approval. The Government will also explore the establishment of a more flexible mechanism, including allowing the Chief Executive and the Financial Secretary to introduce tax incentives that comply with international standards.

(B) Attract and Develop Industries

59. The Government attaches great importance to fostering high value added advanced manufacturing using I&T, and promoting new industrialisation. With the sustained growth in the output of new industries, the Government will step up its efforts to nurture emerging industries locally and attract those from outside Hong Kong, promoting the diversified development of our economy.

Attract an Aircraft Recycling Enterprise and Train Relevant Talents

60. The Government has reached an agreement of intent with a leading European aeronautic services company to operate in Hong Kong. The company will provide aircraft dismantling, as well as recycling and trading services of high-value parts. This will drive the development of industries such as trading, insurance, financing and leasing, creating new job opportunities through the sector's value chain. The company will also collaborate with the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy to provide talent training in relevant professions, which will in turn consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub.

Promote the Development of the Life and Health Technology Industry

61. Hong Kong's life and health technology research is flourishing, underpinned by a mature system connecting the Government and the industry, as well as the academic, research and investment sectors. It aligns with the rise of innovative drugs through home-grown research and development (R&D) in our country and expands into international markets through patent licensing, delivering substantial economic and strategic opportunities for Hong Kong.

Attract More Top-notch International and Mainland Pharmaceutical Companies to Set up Operations in Hong Kong

62. We will attract more pharmaceutical companies to set up operations in Hong Kong to conduct clinical trials and medical treatments for rare disease drugs, high end cancer drugs and advanced therapy products. We will proactively enhance the efficiency of patient recruitment and trial initiation. We will also make use of the GBA Clinical Trial Collaboration Platform in the Hetao area, enabling pharmaceutical companies to conduct trials simultaneously in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Concurrently, we will prepare to set up the International Clinical Trial Academy for nurturing clinical trial professionals in the GBA and host international summits and forums.

63. The Government will set up the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation and submit a legislative proposal on regulating medical devices in 2026, with a view to establishing the centre as an internationally recognised regulatory authority for medical products as soon as possible. We will expedite the ""1+"" mechanism for new drugs, piloting priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs recommended by the Hospital Authority (HA) for treatment of severe or rare diseases. This will help pharmaceutical companies bring innovative drugs to the market sooner. In addition, we will promote the standardisation of clinical data within the GBA and establish a real-world data platform to help pharmaceutical companies bring innovative drugs to the Mainland and international markets more quickly.

64. The HA will establish the Office for Introducing Innovative Drugs and Medical Devices. It will identify the needs and benefits of innovative drug treatments for local patients through big data analytics, bringing in innovative drugs and medical devices that are cost-effective and beneficial to patients.

Promote the Development of the New Energy Industry

65. To meet the country's ""dual carbon"" targets, Hong Kong is working to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, in which the new energy industry will play a crucial role. We will expedite the application of green technologies, create quality employment opportunities and build an influential industry chain of new quality productive forces. Relevant measures are as follows:

(i) We will develop a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry chain. Major airports and airlines in Europe, America and Asia have gradually raised their SAF consumption targets. The Government will work with the Mainland authorities to enable a local enterprise, one of the world's major SAF suppliers, to develop its business in the GBA, covering upstream collection of raw materials, the setting up of production plants and large-scale production, to dovetail with the specified target SAF consumption ratio for flights departing from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) by 2030. An SAF blending facility will also be constructed to boost the competitiveness of our SAF industry and bolster the bargaining power of airlines.

(ii) The Government has made top-level planning in the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong announced last year, and 28 hydrogen energy trial projects are underway or under preparation. These projects cover, among other things, hydrogen buses, hydrogen street washing vehicles and a public hydrogen filling station in the New Territories. We will formulate hydrogen standard certification, establish public hydrogen filling facilities on Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon, press ahead with more trial projects, and develop the GBA Hydrogen Corridor in collaboration with the Guangdong Province.

(iii) The Government is pushing forward the construction of Hong Kong's first large-scale electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling facility at the EcoPark, which is expected to commence operation in the first half of 2026. The recycled black mass converted from locally retired batteries will be supplied to the Mainland and neighbouring regions, promoting the development of the EV battery recycling industry.

Promote the Development of the AI and Data Science Industries

66. AI is the key driving force of a new round of scientific and technological revolution, as well as industrial transformation. With our advantages in scientific research, capital, data and talent, together with abundant use cases, Hong Kong is poised to become a global hub for AI development. The Government will step up the promotion of AI as a core industry for Hong Kong's development, guided by the strategy of ""strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach"". We will promote the development of AI+ and facilitate an extensive and deep integration of AI across sectors, with a view to achieving ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"", while placing strong emphasis on safety risk prevention.

Promote AI Scientific Research and Leverage Our Wealth of Talents

67. The Government has bolstered its efforts to nurture local and attract overseas and Mainland AI professionals. Relevant measures include setting up the AIR@InnoHK research cluster that pooled over a thousand experts. Combined with nearly a thousand AI companies that have gathered in our I&T parks, this helps enhance our AI R&D capabilities and lay the foundations for wide-ranging AI applications.

68. The Government earlier announced the launch of the $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme. It will help funded universities attract international top-notch scientific researchers in AI and other fields to Hong Kong to spearhead basic research in frontier technologies. The scheme will invite applications soon.

69. We have also earmarked $1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute in 2026, to facilitate upstream AI R&D, the midstream and downstream R&D outcome, and the expansion of use cases.

Mobilise Capital for AI Investment

70. Hong Kong has developed full-fledged financing channels covering angel investment, venture capital, private equity funds, patient capital and initial public offerings (IPOs), effectively linking capital and quality projects around the world. The Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited (HKIC), as the ""patient capital"" institution wholly owned by the Government, has invested in a number of AI enterprises engaging businesses in fields such as AI Large Language Model, cloud computing and AI drug development. It will continue to support the development of the AI industry through investments.

Strengthen Advantages in Data for AI

71. Hong Kong will further capitalise on the advantages under ""One Country, Two Systems"", and promote the early establishment of a compliant and secure mechanism for cross-boundary flow of Mainland data to Hong Kong Park for scientific research purposes, supporting AI application testing and innovation.

72. With the establishment of Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre and the Government's launch of the AI Subsidy Scheme, we will put up for tender a site of about 10 hectares at Sandy Ridge in the North District this year for the development of a data facility cluster. It will provide advanced computing power facilities, promoting the development of data and AI-related industries.

Expand the Application of AI

73. The development of AI must be steered by safety and driven by application. The Government attaches great importance to the governance and risk management of AI applications. Information systems of the Government and public organisations must undergo repeated testing, audits and continuous monitoring to ensure security.

74. Meanwhile, the widespread application of AI can create greater value to our society. Under the leadership of the AI Efficacy Enhancement Team, the Government will promote AI applications in government services. The Digital Policy Office will roll out various AI applications in respect of data analysis, customer service and document processing, to promote extensive application in departments, while ensuring security and controllability.

75. Departments will also develop their own AI solutions. Examples include using AI to help the public make non-emergency reports to the police via voice messages and expedite the vetting and approval of transport licences; enhance traffic management by diverting traffic flow according to real-time data; bring convenience to members of the public by providing an AI Assistant for users of the ""iAM Smart"" and the ""Digital Corporate Identity"" platforms to answer enquiries and offer personalised services, as well as to recommend suitable funding schemes and public service support for enterprise, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs); render carer support through an AI chatbot to give carers more convenient access to information; improve the accuracy of histopathological and cytological analysis by introducing digital pathology technology and the application of AI, and enhance patient care efficiency, hospital management and service quality by promoting the application of generative AI in clinical workflows.

76. The Government will also promote AI business applications. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with Cyberport, has launched the second cohort of the AI Sandbox initiative to promote AI applications to more financial institutions. In addition, the HKMA is developing an AI model evaluation approach to step up testing on the system security of financial institutions. The DEVB will provide subsidies to encourage the application of AI in private sector construction works. The Department of Justice (DoJ) will also establish an inter-departmental working group to review the legislation needed to support a wider application of AI.

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-17 11:47,2025-09-17 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/17/P2025091700399.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 17) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Accelerate the Development of the Northern Metropolis

43. The Northern Metropolis, our city's strategic development area bordering Shenzhen, covers a land area and planned population intake accounting for about one-third of Hong Kong's total. It therefore represents a substantial source of economic value and development potential, creating many jobs and boosting productivity. While the Government has been accelerating the development of the Northern Metropolis for the past three years, I remain deeply concerned about its progress, given the sheer size of the area and the magnitude of the investment required.

44. To further develop our economy and improve people's livelihood, we must speed up the Northern Metropolisdevelopment. Accordingly, I have decided to raise the level of decision-making by establishing the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis under my leadership³. The committee will be tasked with streamlining administrative workflows and removing unnecessary barriers and restrictions. Embracing a new mind-set, we will adopt safe, cost-efficient, and time-saving construction methods, materials, and equipment from different jurisdictions. We will also introduce dedicated legislation to accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis.

(A) Establish the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis

45. With the overall planning of the Northern Metropolis, it is now the optimal juncture to expedite the development of the area, bringing in industries and major projects. I will establish and chair the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis, under which the following three working groups will be set up:

(i) Working Group on Devising Development and Operation Models: led by the Financial Secretary, the working group will formulate development and operation models for industry parks in the Northern Metropolis, taking into account their nature and scale. This will include setting up one or more dedicated companies, or statutory or non-statutory bodies, for various industrial parks, devising public-private partnership approaches such as the Build-Operate-Transfer model. It will also explore shifting from ""highest bidder wins"" to industry-linked ""two-envelope approach"" for tendering. We will devise a range of financing schemes, including equity, bonds, government injections, and ""provision of land as a form of capital participation"". The Development Bureau (DEVB) is conducting policy study to set up an industry park company for about 23 hectares of industry land at Hung Shui Kiu. The recommendations will be announced this year after reporting to the working group.

(ii) Working Group on Planning and Construction of the University Town: led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the working group will study the development mode for the Northern Metropolis University Town. It will set up a research task force to conduct field trips on the successful models of university towns elsewhere, seeking views from presidents and representatives of local, Mainland, and other internationally renowned universities. It will also explore the possible way forward to deeply integrate industry development with the academic sectors where Hong Kong has an edge, alongside the strategies for attracting leading universities and research institutes in the Mainland and overseas to establish a base in Hong Kong.

Three batches of sites for the Northern Metropolis University Town will be available for use in 2026 (Hung Shui Kiu), 2028 (Ngau Tam Mei) and 2030 (New Territories North New Town) respectively at the earliest. The working group will make recommendations on the positioning and vision regarding the development of these sites to devise a clear, industry-led approach. The land in the Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area (NDA), for example, will integrate with nearby, high-end professional services as well as vocational and professional education and training facilities for joint development. The land in Ngau Tam Mei can dovetail with the overall innovation and technology (I&T) development of the San Tin Technopole and the Loop, among others, life and health technology industries, and to be used for joint development with the third medical school and an integrated medical teaching and research hospital.

(iii) Working Group on Planning and Development: led by the Deputy Financial Secretary, the working group will be responsible for managing the end-to-end process from planning to implementation, co-ordinating and consolidating such aspects as planning, engineering, land, transportation and environmental protection, to promote industry anchoring, create job opportunities and enhance productivity. A dedicated project supervision office will be established under the working group to strengthen the co-ordination and supervision of the approval process, imposing time limits and phased reporting, to accelerate progress.

(B) Remove Barriers and Ease Restrictions to Streamline Administrative Procedures

46. The Government will streamline administrative procedures, removing barriers and restrictions. Relevant measures include:

(i) Introduce the Fast Track Processing System, adopting superior construction methods from different places, and integrate successful construction technologies, materials and equipment from the Mainland and overseas, in a bid to reduce construction costs and time.

(ii) Implement a ""phased development"" approach on a trial basis with reference to the Mainland's ""1.5-level development"" concept. Specifically, pilot low-density facilities, such as retail, entertainment and convention and exhibition facilities will be developed initially to attract businesses, bringing income and footfall to the area to create momentum before long-term development is rolled out. We will invite market feedback on such approach of phased development for the commercial sites in Hung Shui Kiu.

(iii) Adopt diverse models such as in-situ land exchange and large-scale land disposal to promote market participation and expedite development.

(iv) Employ flexible land-grant arrangements, encouraging enterprises to set up businesses and invest in the area. Sites granted as tenancy instead of land lease may have a term exceeding seven years to provide greater flexibility. Depending on industry policies, open tendering, restricted tendering or direct land grants may be adopted.

(v) Allow land owners in the Northern Metropolis to voluntarily surrender land planned to be resumed by the Government to offset the amount payable for in-situ land exchange or large-scale land disposal in NDAs. This will promote market participation in the development.

(vi) Adopt a ""pay for what you build"" approach to reduce the cost of land premiums in the Northern Metropolis. In lease modifications, subject to the condition of the land parcels involved, owners will be allowed to pay the required premium according to the actual built floor area and use, rather than the maximum floor area based on the maximum plot ratio under the current planning regime. We will also consider allowing developers to pay land premiums in phases, according to the development scale.

(vii) Commence a land use review for Au Tau, to capitalise on the development potential brought by the Northern Link. We will consider a larger proportion of private housing in the area around Sha Po at Au Tau Station for development into an NDA. We will engage the Mass Transit Railway Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to conduct the review, announcing its results next year.

47. Where appropriate, we may also apply the above administrative measures to areas outside the Northern Metropolis.

(C) Dedicated Legislation to Accelerate theDevelopment of Northern Metropolis

48. I will introduce dedicated legislation to accelerate the development of Northern Metropolis, empowering the Government to devise simplified statutory procedures for issues including setting up statutory industry park companies and providing them with dedicated channels for funding; managing the cross-boundary flow of people, goods, capital, data and biological samples in designated areas, to attract research institutes and high-end manufacturers to establish a presence in Hong Kong; speeding up the approval of building plans; relaxing permitted uses in outline zoning plans (OZPs) and fine-tuning development parameters; and expediting compensation payment for land resumption.

(D) Expedite the Development of the Loop

49. The Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone (the Co-operation Zone) is located on both sides of the Shenzhen River, comprising Shenzhen Park and Hong Kong Park. Leveraging the advantages of ""one zone, two parks"", the Co-operation Zone will promote collaboration between the two parks in the development of I&T.

50. The construction of the first three buildings in Phase 1 of the Hong Kong Park of the Co-operation Zone (Hong Kong Park) has been completed. Tenants from life and health technology, microelectronics, new energy, AI and other pillar industries are gradually moving in. The construction of the other five buildings will be completed progressively from 2027.

51. The Government will roll out parcels of the remaining land in Phase 1 this year. We will complete Phase 2 planning for the development scale and distribution of industries to finalise Hong Kong Park's overall layout and consider offering work spaces flexibly to companies under the ""moving in while construction is underway"" approach. That will enable them to move in earlier without having to wait for the completion of the entire park's construction.

(E) Development Outline for the San Tin Technopole

52. The San Tin Technopole, spanning some 210 hectaresâ´ of land for I&T, will serve as a strategic base for the I&T industry. The Government will publish the Conceptual Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San Tin Technopole this year. It will cover top-level planning, industry positioning and layout, the co-ordinated development of land parcels, and the strategies for channelling market resources to invest in the development.

(F) Expedite Transport Infrastructural Development

53. To dovetail with the development of the Northern Metropolis, construction works of Kwu Tung Station and Hung Shui Kiu Station are proceeding in full swing for completion in 2027 and 2030 respectively. Adopting an innovative mind-set, the Government has signed the Part 1 Project Agreement with the MTRCL. It will concurrently develop the Northern Link Spur Line in combination with the Main Line, achieving simultaneous commissioning by 2034 or earlier.

54. Cross-boundary railway projects will lead to the comprehensive integration of metro networks in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, significantly enhancing the GBA's infrastructure connectivity and boosting industry's confidence in setting up operations. We are pressing ahead with the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link (Hung Shui Kiu-Qianhai) project and have invited expressions of interest from contractors and operators on the Hong Kong section of the project.

³The existing Steering Committee on the Northern Metropolis will be discontinued.
â´Not including the 87-hectare Hong Kong Park.

行政長官向立法會發表《行政長官2025年施政報告》發言全文（三）,2025-09-17 11:37,2025-09-17 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/17/P2025091700218.htm,"第三章加快發展北部都會區

43. 北都與深圳接壤，面積和未來人口約佔香港三分之一，是香港的戰略發展區域，具有巨大經濟價值和發展潛力，能創造大量職位和提升生產力。雖然政府過去三年已加快建設，但北都幅員廣闊，所需資源投資龐大，我一直為此心急如焚。

44. 為更好發展經濟、改善民生，北都建設務必加速推進。我決定提升北都發展的決策層次，成立由我領導的「北都發展委員會」³，簡化行政流程，拆牆鬆綁，以新思維採納不同地方的建造方法、材料和裝備等，達致既安全又省錢省時的目標，並為加快北都發展訂立專項法例。

一、成立「北都發展委員會」

45. 北都的基本規劃已出台，現時是加快發展北都、引入產業和重大項目的最佳銜接期。我會成立由行政長官擔任主席的「北都發展委員會」，下設三個工作組：

(i) 「發展及營運模式設計組」——由財政司司長任組長，按北都各指定發展區的性質和規模，設計發展及營運模式，包括為不同產業園區度身成立一間或多間園區公司、法定或非法定專門機構，制訂公私營合作模式如「建設—運營—移交」（BOT）等；研究從「價高者得」招標轉向「產業綁定」的「雙信封制」；並設計不同融資方案，包括股份制、債券、政府注資及「土地參股」等。發展局正就洪水橋約23公頃產業用地進行產業園公司的政策研究，待向「發展及營運模式設計組」匯報後會在今年內公布建議。

(ii) 「大學城籌劃及建設組」——由政務司司長任組長，成立調研專班，研究北都大學城發展模式，實地考察不同地方大學城的成功模式，廣納本地、內地和國際知名大學校長或代表等意見。小組亦會研究把香港優勢學術領域與產業深度結合發展的路徑，以及促進內地和國際領先的大學或研究中心進駐的策略。

三批大學城土地最早將分別於2026年（洪水橋）、2028年（牛潭尾）及2030年（新界北新市鎮）供使用。小組將就三批土地的發展定位及願景作出建議，並考慮以產業為導向，例如在洪水橋╱厦村新發展區一帶，融合鄰近高端專業服務和職業專才培訓聯動發展；牛潭尾一帶則可考慮配合新田科技城和河套區的整體創科發展，包括生命健康科技產業，並與第三間醫學院及綜合醫教研醫院等聯動發展。

(iii) 「規劃及發展工作組」——由財政司副司長任組長，負責由規劃到執行的全流程管理，就統籌整合規劃、工程、土地、交通、環保等作全面部署，促進產業進駐，創造職位和提升生產力。小組特設專案監督辦公室，加強工程審批的統籌和監督，並設時限和分階段通報機制，以加快速度。

二、簡化行政措施拆牆鬆綁

46. 政府會簡化行政措施拆牆鬆綁，包括：

(i) 引入快速審批制度，採納各地優秀的建築方法，結合海外和內地的成功建造技術、用料和設備等，降低工程成本並縮短工期。

(ii) 以試點形式推行「分階段開發」模式，參考內地「1.5級開發」概念，容許初期先建設和營運具先導性的低密度設施，例如零售、娛樂或會議展覽等項目，藉此吸引企業進駐、創造收益和匯聚人流，發揮拉動作用，再落實長遠發展，其中會就洪水橋商業用地施行「分階段開發」模式邀請巿場提交意見。

(iii) 以多元開發模式，包括原址換地、「片區開發」等，推動市場參與，加速發展。

(iv) 靈活批撥土地，推動企業落戶和投資。倘若以租約而非地契批出，租期可長於七年，提供更大彈性。配合不同產業政策，可採用公開招標、限制性招標或直接批地的模式。

(v) 容許北都土地業權人主動交回政府計劃徵收的土地，藉此抵銷其在北都新發展區原址換地或「片區開發」所須繳付的金額，鼓勵市場參與北都發展。

(vi) 以「按實補價」減低北都補地價資金成本，即地契修訂過程中，視乎地塊情況，容許業主無須按規劃地積比率上限計算的最高樓面進行補地價，改以實際興建樓面及實際用途釐定應繳補價，並考慮容許發展商按實際開發規模分階段補繳地價。

(vii) 開展凹頭土地用途檢討，善用北環線帶來的發展潛力，在凹頭站沙埔一帶考慮引入更大佔比的私營房屋，拓展為新發展區。委託香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）進行檢討，明年公布結果。

47. 如合適，上述行政措施亦可套用在北都以外的地方。

三、「加快發展北都」專屬法律

48. 我會訂立加快發展北都專屬法例，授權政府制訂簡化的法定程序，包括成立法定園區公司；為園區公司設立專項撥款渠道以注入資金；管理指定地區跨境流動的便捷方法，包括人流、物流、資金流及數據和生物樣本流，吸引科研及高端製造業落戶香港；加快批出建築圖則；放寬各分區大綱圖的准許用途及微調發展參數；加快繳付徵收土地的賠償等。

四、加快發展河套

49. 河套深港科技創新合作區（河套合作區）位處深圳河兩側，涵蓋深圳園區及香港園區，憑藉「一區兩園」優勢推動兩地創科合作發展。

50. 河套合作區香港園區（河套香港園區）第一期首三座大樓已落成，生命健康科技、微電子、新能源及人工智能等支柱產業租戶正陸續進駐；另外五座大樓於2027年起陸續完工。

51. 政府今年內會推出第一期餘下用地的選定地塊；完成第二期發展規模、產業分布等規劃，完成河套香港園區總體布局；以及考慮以「邊建設、邊進駐」模式，靈活為企業提供工作空間，讓企業無須等待整區完成工程就可提早進駐。

五、新田科技城發展綱要

52. 新田科技城有約210公頃⁴創科用地，是創科產業的戰略基地。政府今年內會公布《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》，涵蓋頂層設計、產業定位和布局、各片區的統籌發展、引導市場資源投入發展的策略等。

六、加快交通基礎設施建設

53. 為配合北都發展，古洞站和洪水橋站的工程正全速進行，將分別於2027年和2030年竣工。政府已與港鐵公司簽訂第一部分項目協議，以新思維合併北環線主線和支線同步推展，目標是2034年或之前同步開通。

54. 跨境鐵路項目將打通港深兩地的地鐵網絡，大幅提升大灣區基建互聯互通，增強產業進駐信心。我們正全力推動港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海），並已就項目香港段邀請承建商及營運商提交意向書。

³現時的北部都會區督導委員會將會取消。

⁴不包括佔地87公頃的河套香港園區。

Steadfastly and Successfully Implement ""One Country, Two Systems"" and Strengthen Our Governance Systems

(A) Resolutely Implementthe ""One Country, Two Systems"" Principle ""One Country, Two Systems"" Remains Unchanged

10. As President Xi Jinping pointed out, ""One Country, Two Systems"" possesses its distinctive institutional strengths and strong vitality, is a good system that sustains the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao. It is a good system that facilitates endeavours to build China into a great country and achieve national rejuvenation, and it is a good system for ensuring peaceful coexistence and mutual benefit between different social systems. So we must stay committed to this cause.

11. We will continue to fully, faithfully and resolutely implement ""One Country, Two Systems"", ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy. ""One Country, Two Systems"" is the best institutional arrangement for maintaining Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. The more firmly the ""One Country"" principle is upheld, the greater the strength the ""Two Systems"" will be unleashed.

12. Being a global metropolis, Hong Kong has remained an open, inclusive, safe and stable city underpinned by the rule of law since our return to the Motherland 28 years ago. With an ever-expanding influence internationally, Hong Kong is rated the world's freest economy, as well as an advanced and business-friendly city. These fully demonstrate the notable institutional strengths and great vitality of ""One Country, Two Systems"".

13. Hong Kong has solid backing from the Motherland, enjoying far-reaching opportunities brought by national development, from the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to the Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative. Meanwhile, as an international city with its distinctive role of connecting to the rest of the world, Hong Kong also has infinite room for development.

14. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will, as always, maintain the constitutional order of the HKSAR as stipulated under the Constitution and the Basic Law, ensuring the steadfast and successful implementation of ""One Country, Two Systems"".

Safeguard National Security

15. The fundamental premise of ""One Country, Two Systems"" is to safeguard sovereignty, security and development interests of our nation.

16. Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law five years ago, we have overcome turmoil and unrest, and maintained safety and stability in our society. Hong Kong has transitioned from chaos to order and is now advancing from stability to prosperity. The HKSAR Government will continue to steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, while thoroughly adopting the Holistic Approach to National Security. We will remain vigilant at all times, prevent and mitigate risks, and ensure the long-term stability and safety of Hong Kong.

17. We will continue to enhance the legal system and enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security, doing our utmost to ensure that laws are observed and strictly enforced to bring offenders to account, so as to prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security.

18. The Government will spare no effort in promoting national security education. Since its opening a year ago, the National Security Exhibition Gallery has already attracted over one million visitors. More than 3 300 national security education district tutors have been trained to promote national security messages in the community.

Implement ""Patriots Administering Hong Kong""

19. With the improved electoral system and district governance system of the HKSAR, the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"" has been fully implemented. The HKSAR Government has held six important elections, including the recent Election Committee Subsector By-elections.

20. The HKSAR will devote all efforts in preparing for the general election for the eighth-term Legislative Council (LegCo) to be held on 7 December this year, ensuring that the election is conducted in a fair, just, honest, safe and orderly manner.

Improve Governance at District Level

21. As part of the reforms to improve district governance, the Government set up the Steering Committee on District Governance and the Task Force on District Governance in July 2023. They are chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration and the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration respectively, with the aim of strengthening co-ordination to address issues such as environmental hygiene, community beautification, facility development and community services more effectively.

22. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) and the Home Affairs Department (HAD) will continue to lead District Councils (DCs), the ""three district committees""¹ and Care Teams to proactively harness local strengths to foster compassion and vibrancy within the community.

(B) Patriotic Education

Commemorate the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and in the World Anti-Fascist War

23. This year marks the 80th anniversary of victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and in the World Anti-Fascist War. The HKSAR Government has organised a series of large-scale commemorative activities, including exhibitions, film screenings and library events, for the public to gain a deeper understanding of the spirit of unity and resilience displayed by Chinese people in the fight for peace. We will collaborate with Shenzhen to promote a new red educational route, under the theme of ""Chinese Cultural Celebrity Rescue"" history, so as to enhance understanding among people of Hong Kong and tourists of the history of the War of Resistance in Hong Kong.

24. We will comprehensively review and conduct restoration and protection work on historic sites relating to the participation of the Communist Party of China in the War of Resistance in various districts, with a view to integrating them into tourism routes and educational activities.
Promote Chinese Culture

25. The Government will give full play to the role of the Chinese Culture Promotion Office. This includes curating the Chinese Culture Festival and exhibitions of the General History of China series as signature projects, and spearheading the establishment of a museum to showcase the development and achievements of our country, as well as the Chinese Culture Experience Centre. The Office will also continue to launch a broad spectrum of community-oriented initiatives to promote Chinese culture.

Promote Activities and Facilities on Patriotic Education

26. The Government will promote patriotic education facilities in the Mainland, making them the patriotic education bases of the HKSAR to encourage more students and young people to visit.

27. We will establish close connection with patriotic groups to unite efforts in organising more patriotic education activities.

Strengthen Students' Affection for and Sense of Belonging to the Country

28. The Education Bureau (EDB) will integrate patriotic education into daily learning and teaching. We will popularise the ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country"" series of activities, continuously strengthen the Constitution and Basic Law Student Ambassadors Training Scheme, design itineraries for students to experience the founding history of our country, and conduct focus inspections on national education. We will also continue to provide professional development and activities for teachers and students that tie in with the updated national security education, promulgate the final version of the Values Education Curriculum Framework, and optimise the curriculum frameworks for the senior secondary Chinese History and History subjects.

(C) Further Enhance Governance

Establish the Heads of Department Accountability System

29. Since assuming office, I have been constantly taking forward reforms to build a ""result-oriented"" government. In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong ranked second globally in ""Government efficiency"", reflecting well on Hong Kong's civil servants being an outstanding team, and the reforms introduced by the current-term Government, alongside the concerted efforts of the civil service.

30. Nevertheless, given the large number of executive departments and officers in the Government, problems inevitably occur in individual departments. The causes behind them must be identified in good time and rectified to prevent them from undermining the overall trust that society places in the Government, and to avoid causing injustice to the overwhelming majority of our civil servants, who are dedicated to their duties.

31. I believe that effective management is of utmost importance. Senior civil servants are all responsible for management. I have therefore been considering ways to strengthen their sense of responsibility to enhance the overall management standard of the departments. After considerations, I believe that the most direct and effective way is to strengthen the accountability of the HoDs by clearly emphasising that HoDs are tasked to build a strong management team, and lead their senior civil servants to jointly manage staff and operation systems. While HoDs have always been responsible for the work of their departments, the Government has not yet institutionalised overall accountability. Establishing a Heads of Department Accountability System (the HoD Accountability System), therefore, is of critical significance. The details are as follows.

Aims

32. Establishing the HoD Accountability System has the following primary aims:

(i) To render the political accountability required of Secretaries of Department and Directors of Bureau in policy formulation, and the administrative accountability required of civil servants in implementing policy initiatives better articulated with each other, with clarification of their respective roles.

(ii) To drive HoDs to establish an effective management team and operating systems, eliminating bottlenecks and plugging shortfalls, improving workflow on an ongoing basis, and continuously enhancing departmental efficiency.

(iii) To identify the deficiencies whenever a problem occurs in a department, putting in place improvements, attributing responsibility to the appropriate parties, and taking administrative or disciplinary actions against those responsible in accordance with the civil service management regime. The consequences include warnings, reprimands, not being granted a salary increment, relegation in rank, reduction in salary, compulsory retirement and even dismissal.

The Investigation Mechanism

33. Investigations will be divided into two tiers, in accordance with the severity of the problems identified:

(i) Tier I: if the problems are of a general nature, the investigation should be taken up by the HoD concerned. They will be responsible for identifying the deficiencies of the department and putting in place improvements, taking forward administrative or disciplinary actions against the officers who have underperformed or engaged in misconduct in accordance with the civil service management regime.

(ii) Tier II: if a serious problem occurs in a department or the problem is widespread or a repetitive, systemic one, or there are indications that the HoD concerned is implicated in the problem, the investigation will be carried out by an investigation panel set up specifically under the HoD Accountability System. The panel will identify the deficiencies of the department and attribute responsibility to the appropriate parties. It should be independent from the Government, such that the investigation will be impartial and independent. It should be able to examine civil servants of all ranks to ensure that the investigation is thorough. It should be familiar with the general operation of the Government, to ensure that the investigation is completed efficiently. It should be a standing team to be called upon, ensuring its certainty and readiness.

Independent Panel of Investigation

34. To achieve the aforementioned aims, I will expand the existing functions of the Public Service Commission² to enable it to conduct investigations. Independent of the Government and in operation for many years, the commission is conversant with the management system of the civil service. Its current statutory functions include advising the Chief Executive on matters affecting the public service (including disciplinary cases of civil servants). The existing functions of the commission do not cover investigation. Extending its functions to include investigation, and inviting experts or government officials not related to the department being investigated to participate, can ensure both the independence and impartiality of the investigations concerned as well as the efficiency of the investigation, thereby achieving the four requirements set out in paragraph 33(ii).

35. The Government will make subsidiary legislation under the Public Service Commission Ordinance to implement the above proposal.

Activation Mechanism

36. When a situation as described in paragraph 33(ii) occurs in a department, the relevant Director of Bureau must report it to the Secretary of Department concerned. Upon obtaining the latter's agreement, the Director of Bureau should activate the Tier II independent investigation mechanism. The Secretary of Department concerned can also, on their own initiative, direct the relevant Director of Bureau to activate the investigation mechanism.

Strengthen the Performance Appraisal System for Civil Servants

37. The overall performance of civil servants is fundamental to the effectiveness of departments. A fair and honest assessment of staff performance can encourage good-performers to strive for excellence, and suitably handle staff who have under-performed or misconducted themselves. In this connection, establishing an effective performance appraisal system will help HoDs enhance the overall effectiveness of the departments, raise the morale of good performers, assist those with room for improvement to improve their capability, and handle the small number of staff involved in misconduct in a fair manner.

38. The Civil Service Bureau is tasked to conduct a study developing a more rigorous performance appraisal system that reflects and differentiates the performance levels of staff more effectively.

39. Apart from assessing the performance of senior civil servants (including HoDs) in accordance with the existing mechanism, Secretaries of Department and Directors of Bureau will need to supervise the senior civil servants under their charge to properly perform personnel management work for staff at all ranks, including performance appraisal, posting, promotion and discipline.

Set up an AI Efficacy Enhancement Team

40. The application of AI in the work of the Government can effectively enhance efficiency. The Census and Statistics Department, for example, has applied AI technology to examine trade data and retrieve financial information from the financial statements and announcements of thousands of listed companies for statistical compilation. This has resulted in an exponential surge in efficiency. The 1823 services also use AI technology to recognise automatically voice enquiries from members of the public, and help draft written responses, reducing about 30% of the processing time.

41. To further enhance the efficacy of the Government, I will set up an AI Efficacy Enhancement Team to co-ordinate and steer government departments to:

(i) Apply AI technology effectively to their work.

(ii) Explore process re-engineering to keep pace with the times.

(iii) Promote technological reform in departments to improve efficacy.

42. The team will be led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, with the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry and the Commissioner for Digital Policy serving as the Deputy Leader and Secretary General respectively. The team will also invite a representative from the private sector to serve as another Deputy Leader, to bring in new perspectives and front-line market experience. The team will examine with government departments their need for reform, with priority given to departments with greater interface with the public. Departments may also initiate request to the team for prioritised assistance in enhancing their efficiency.

¹ Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees and District Fire Safety Committees.

² The Public Service Commission, consisting of a Chairman and two to eight members, is a statutory body established under the Public Service Commission Ordinance. Its functions include advising the Chief Executive regarding the public service and matters affecting the conduct and discipline of public officers; the Ordinance also empowers the Chief Executive in Council to make regulations.

強化治理體系

一、堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」方針

「一國兩制」長期不變

10. 習近平主席指出，「一國兩制」具有顯著制度優勢和強大生命力，是保持香港、澳門長期繁榮穩定的好制度，是服務強國建設、民族復興偉業的好制度，是實現不同社會制度和平共處、合作共贏的好制度，必須長期堅持。

11. 我們會繼續全面準確、堅定不移貫徹「一國兩制」、「港人治港」、高度自治的方針。「一國兩制」是保持香港長期繁榮穩定的最佳制度安排。「一國」原則越堅固，「兩制」優勢越彰顯。

12. 香港作為國際大都會，回歸28年來始終保持開放包容、法治健全、安全穩定，國際影響力持續擴大，更獲評為世界最自由經濟體及高效便利營商的先進城市，充分彰顯「一國兩制」顯著的制度優勢和強大生命力。

13. 香港有祖國的堅強後盾，在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）建設到共建「一帶一路」倡議等國家戰略中機遇處處；而且作為國際城市，香港有聯通世界的獨特角色，發展無限。

14. 特區政府會一如既往維護《憲法》和《基本法》所確立的特區憲制秩序，確保「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠。

維護國家安全

15. 維護國家主權、安全、發展利益是「一國兩制」方針的最高原則。

16. 《香港國安法》實施五年來，香港告別了動盪不安，社會保持安全穩定。香港從「由亂到治」邁向「由治及興」。特區政府會繼續堅定不移維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，深入踐行「總體國家安全觀」，居安思危，防範風險，確保香港長治久安。

17. 我們會持續完善維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制，全力防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全行為和活動，有法必依、執法必嚴、違法必究。

18. 政府會不遺餘力推動國家安全教育。國家安全展覽廳開幕一年，已錄得超過100萬參觀人次；另逾3 300名國家安全地區導師已完成培訓，在社區推廣國安信息。

落實「愛國者治港」原則

19. 在完善特區選舉制度和地區治理體系後，「愛國者治港」原則已全面貫徹落實。特區政府舉行了六場重要選舉，包括剛舉行的選舉委員會界別分組補選。

20. 特區會全力籌備好今年12月7日舉行的第八屆立法會選舉，確保選舉公平、公正、誠實和安全有序進行。

完善地區治理

21. 作為完善地區治理的一部分，政府於2023年7月成立分別由政務司司長和副司長主持的「地區治理領導委員會」及「地區治理專組」，加強統籌力度，有效處理環境衞生、社區美化、設施建設和地區服務等問題。

22. 民政及青年事務局（民青局）和民政事務總署（民政總署）會繼續帶領區議會、地區三會¹和關愛隊積極發揮地區力量，為社區帶來關愛和活力。

二、愛國主義教育

紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年

23. 今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，特區政府舉辦一系列大型紀念活動，透過展覽、電影及圖書館活動等，讓市民深刻認識中國人民在爭取和平進程中所展現的團結和堅韌精神。我們會與深圳合作，推廣以「中國文化名人大營救」歷史為主題的紅色體驗研學新路線，加深市民和旅客對香港抗戰歷史的認識。

24. 我們會全面梳理及修繕保護各區的中共抗戰遺址，並融入體驗路線和教育活動。

弘揚中華文化

25. 政府會充分發揮弘揚中華文化辦公室的角色，打造「中華文化節」和中國通史系列展覽成為品牌項目、推進設立介紹國家發展和成就的博物館及中華文化體驗館，並會繼續推出聯繫社區的多元化活動，弘揚中華文化。

推廣愛國主義教育活動和設施

26. 政府會推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施，將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地，推動更多學生和青年參訪。

27. 我們會與愛國團體建立密切關係，凝聚力量，協同舉辦更多愛國主義教育活動。

厚植學生家國情懷

28. 教育局會將愛國主義教育融入日常學與教，包括普及化「心繫家國」活動；持續加強《憲法》和《基本法》學生校園大使培訓計劃；設計建國歷史體驗行程；進行國民教育重點視學；配合更新的國家安全教育，持續為師生提供專業發展和活動；公布《價值觀教育課程架構》定稿；以及優化高中中史和歷史科課程框架。

三、進一步強化治理

建立「部門首長責任制」

29. 我上任以來不斷推行改革，建立「以結果為目標」的政府。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》中，香港在「政府效率」排名世界第二，反映香港公務員整體是一支優秀隊伍，亦反映本屆政府的改革和公務員共同努力的成果。

30. 然而，政府執行部門和人員為數不少，難免會有個別部門出現問題的情況。因此，必須及時查找原因並予以糾正，防止個別問題影響社會對政府的整體信任，且避免對廣大盡忠職守的公務員造成不公。

31. 我認為有效管理至關重要，高級公務員是負責管理的官員；為此，我一直思考如何進一步加強其責任意識，以提升部門整體管理水平。經反覆思考，我認為最直接有效的方法，是強化部門首長的責任擔當，清楚強調部門首長須負責建立好管理團隊，並帶領其高級公務員共同做好管理人員和運作系統的工作。雖然部門首長一向對部門表現負上責任，但政府至今未將有關責任整體制度化。因此，建立清晰的「部門首長責任制」（責任制）具有關鍵意義，其內容如下。

目的

32. 建立責任制有以下主要目的：

(i) 把司局長就制訂政策須政治問責和公務員就執行政策須行政問責兩者，更好銜接起來，並說明兩者的角色。

(ii) 推動部門首長建立有效管理團隊與運作系統，破瓶頸、補短板，持續優化工作流程，不斷提升部門效能。

(iii) 當部門出現問題，須查找不足、予以改善，並釐清責任誰屬，按缺失輕重情況，依照公務員管理制度進行相應行政或紀律處理，後果包括警告、譴責、不獲增薪、降級、扣薪、勒令退休以至革職等。

調查機制

33. 按照問題大小輕重程度，將調查分為兩個級別處理：

(i) 第一級：若問題屬一般性質，調查由部門首長負責，查找不足，予以改善，並按照公務員管理制度對過失人員作出相應行政或紀律處理。

(ii) 第二級：如部門出現嚴重問題，或涉及廣泛或重複性的系統問題，或有跡象顯示問題可能涉及部門首長的角色時，調查由專為責任制設立的調查小組負責，查找不足與釐清責任。該小組獨立於政府系統，以確保調查公正獨立；小組可調查任何級別公務員，確保調查全面；小組了解政府一般運作，確保調查能有效率地盡快完成；小組將為常設隊伍，隨時候召，確保其肯定性和準備性。

獨立調查小組

34. 為達致以上目的，我會擴大現時「公務員敍用委員會」²的職能以進行調查。委員會獨立於政府，已運作多年，了解公務員管理系統；其現有法定職能包括就公職服務事項（包括公務員紀律個案）向行政長官提供意見。現時委員會的職務不涵蓋調查，擴大其職能以涵蓋調查，並可邀請專家或與被調查部門無關連的政府人員參與調查，既可確保有關調查的獨立性和公正性，亦可確保調查效率，並達致第33(ii)段的四點要求。

35. 政府會按《公務員敍用委員會條例》，以附屬法例形式訂立規例，付諸實行。

啟動機制

36. 當部門出現上述第33(ii)段的情況時，有關局長須向其所屬司長匯報，獲其同意後啟動第二級獨立調查機制；司長亦可主動指示相關局長啟動調查機制。

強化公務員評核機制

37. 政府部門的效能，建基於廣大公務員的整體表現。公正、如實地評核人員表現，既可鼓勵優秀公務員精益求精，亦能適當處理能力不足或行為有缺失的人員。因此，建立有效的評核機制，有助部門首長持續提升部門整體效能、提振優秀公務員士氣，並協助有待改進人員提升能力，同時公正處理少數行為不當的人員。

38. 公務員事務局須作出研究，建立更嚴謹的評核機制，更有效反映和區分人員的工作表現等級。

39. 各司局長除了根據現行機制，評核高級公務員（包括部門首長等）的工作表現外，亦須督導轄下高級公務員做好其下各層級人員的人事管理，包括評核、調配、晉升和紀律跟進等。

成立「AI效能提升組」

40. AI人工智能應用在政府工作可有效提升效能。例如，政府統計處運用AI技術審核貿易統計資料，以及從上千間上市公司的財務報表和公告中提取財務資訊，編製統計數據，效能皆以倍計提升。1823服務亦使用了AI科技，自動辨識市民語音查詢並協助草擬書面回覆，減省約三成處理時間。

41. 為進一步提升政府效能，我會成立「AI效能提升組」，統籌和指導政府部門：

(i) 於工作中有效應用AI人工智能技術。

(ii) 研究重組工作流程（process re-engineering），與時並進。

(iii) 推動部門進行科技革新，以提升效能。

42. 政務司副司長將擔任組長，創新科技及工業局（創科局）局長和數字政策專員分別擔任副組長及秘書長；同時邀請一位業界代表擔任副組長，引入新思維和市場實務經驗。「AI效能提升組」將按優次與部門研究提升效能的需求，可先考慮與市民接觸面較大的部門；部門亦可主動提出要求，請「AI效能提升組」優先提供協助。

¹分區委員會、地區撲滅罪行委員會及地區防火委員會

²「公務員敍用委員會」為法定機構，按《公務員敍用委員會條例》成立，由一位主席及兩至八名委員組成，職能包括就公職服務和涉及公職人員的品行及紀律的任何事項，向行政長官提供意見；《條例》賦予行政長官會同行政會議訂立規例的權力。

Mr President, Honourable Members and fellow citizens,

Chapter I

Deepen Reforms and Committed to People's Livelihood

1. This year marks the conclusion of the National 14th Five-Year Plan period and the preparatory year for the 15th Five-Year Plan. This Policy Address serves as a roadmap for Hong Kong to strive for a vibrant economy, pursue development, and improve people's livelihood – accelerating our advancement from stability to prosperity. It also outlines a strategic plan for Hong Kong to proactively align with national development strategies and achieve breakthroughs in forging a new landscape.

2. My ultimate objective in governance is to improve people's livelihood with better housing for members of the public, higher income for workers, enhanced care for the elderly, and greater prospects for young people. The well-being of our people is intimately linked to the health of our economy, making economic growth the key driver of livelihood improvement. Growth creates job opportunities and wealth, which will in turn generate additional resources for public services, enabling the Government to deliver more and better services. Improvement in people's livelihood will then spark new social demands that stimulate market development, further promoting economic growth. The economy and people's livelihood are mutually reinforcing: each strengthens the other.

3. Since taking office, I have been actively promoting reforms, both within the Government and in the wider community, thereby facilitating economic growth and improving people's livelihood. I have transformed and instilled in the Government a culture that is ""result-oriented"". We have been pressing ahead with public housing production and introduced Light Public Housing (LPH). Three years ago, applicants for public rental housing (PRH) waited an average of 6.1 years for a flat; the Composite Waiting Time is now 5.1 years, a reduction of one full year. Over the same period, the median household income rose by $3,000, an increase of 11%. Since I assumed office, the economy has rebounded – turning from negative to positive and gaining momentum. This year's growth is projected at 2% – 3%. In the past three years, Hong Kong has moved up one place to become the third-ranked global financial centre and has climbed four spots to rank third globally in overall competitiveness. In the last two years, we have risen 12 places to the fourth globally in talent competitiveness. Furthermore, Hong Kong is ranked seventh among the world's top 10 safest cities.

4. The Policy Address this year is anchored in two pillars: the economy and people's livelihood.

5. The Northern Metropolis is the new engine for Hong Kong's economic development and holds immense potential. I will accelerate its development and set up the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis under my guidance to formulate operational models for the various development areas therein. I will also expedite the development of the University Town, streamline administrative procedures by removing barriers and easing restrictions, adopt safe, efficient and cost-effective construction practices, and introduce dedicated legislation to fast-track the Northern Metropolis development. The Government will attract and cultivate industries to create jobs and enhance productivity. Preferential policy packages will also be formulated to improve efficiency and flexibility in negotiations with enterprises that are establishing and scaling up operations, thereby creating more high-quality, high income jobs and further boosting productivity.

6. Under ""One Country, Two Systems"", Hong Kong enjoys the unique advantages of attracting overseas enterprises and assisting Mainland enterprises to go global. In the past, we focused primarily on bringing in enterprises, achieving remarkable growth and success. The new opportunities ahead for Hong Kong, however, will come from helping Mainland enterprises expand abroad. This rapid shift in opportunities reflects the reshaping of the global trade order, prompting Mainland enterprises to shift from concentrating on a single market and towards proactively tapping into emerging markets. The Government will leverage Hong Kong's strength as a platform for going global to reinforce the role of Hong Kong as an international centre, capitalising on our advantages in areas such as finance, trading, professional services, supply chain management and professional networks, creating more jobs and higher income, further promoting the headquarters economy to unlock more business opportunities. We will also develop education, technology and talent in an integrated manner, and press ahead with the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism, enabling the people of Hong Kong to live in a community with thriving economy and vibrant culture.

7. To strengthen governance, I will establish an accountability system for Heads of Department (HoDs) by systematising and institutionalising their responsibility for their departments, and enhance the appraisal system for civil servants so that a culture of continuous improvement can take root. I will also set up the AI Efficacy Enhancement Team to drive technological reform, co-ordinating and steering government departments in the effective use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and in the re-engineering of outdated workflows. Meanwhile, I will promote the development of AI+ with strong emphasis on safety risk prevention, and implement AI government services and facilitate the wide-scale application and development of AI across different sectors in the society to boost overall efficiency. I will also put into practice the philosophy of better integration of ""an efficient market"" with ""a capable government"", and introduce market-based business model to enhance the services of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).

8. This Policy Address concludes with the most extensive chapter concerning people's livelihood. It encompasses nine critical areas which are essential to the well-being of the community, covering land and housing, transport, healthcare, social welfare, labour protection and a caring and inclusive society, under which include continuously increasing public housing supply to enrich the housing ladder; creating land for large development projects, promoting long-term economic development and addressing housing needs while increasing government land reserve; continuing healthcare reform; implementing 11 measures to support local economy, continuing the work on targeted poverty alleviation, promoting the principle of ""ageing in place as the core, with institutional care as back-up"", supporting and protecting workers, and establishing the Working Group on Ageing Society Strategies to meet the challenges brought by ageing. These demonstrates my commitment to placing people's livelihood at the heart of governance. Indeed, economic development ultimately serves the well-being of our people, enabling them to enjoy better quality of life.

9. I would like to thank the public for their valuable opinions during the consultation exercise, and for their broad support of my policy directions and strategies. This Policy Address will elaborate on our policy objectives, key measures and key performance indicators (KPIs). A Supplement offering more details on the policy measures and related matters has also been compiled.

立法會主席、各位議員、各位市民：

第一章深化改革心繫民生

1. 今年是國家「十四五」規劃的收官之年，亦是「十五五」規劃的謀篇布局之年。這份《施政報告》既是香港全力「拼經濟謀發展惠民生」、加快邁向「由治及興」的進程表，亦是香港主動對接國家發展戰略、實現突破新局面的策略部署。

2. 改善民生是我施政的最終目標，讓市民有更好住房、打工仔有更多收入、長者有更好照顧、青年有更好發展。民生與經濟息息相關，經濟增長是改善民生的基礎，能創造就業和財富，為公共服務提供更多資源，讓政府提供更多服務；民生改善則帶動社會需求，激發市場活力，促進經濟發展。經濟與民生，兩者相輔相成。

3. 我上任以來，積極推動政府與社會改革，發展經濟、改善民生。我改變了政府文化，建立「以結果為目標」的政府。我們大力興建公營房屋，推出簡約公屋。三年前，公屋申請者平均等待6.1年才能上樓；現在綜合輪候時間為5.1年，縮短了整整一年。家庭收入中位數在三年間上升3,000元，增幅約11%；我上任後，香港經濟增長由負轉正，更好加快復甦，預計今年會正增長2至3%；這三年間，香港金融中心地位上升一位至世界第三；整體競爭力上升四位至世界第三；人才競爭力兩年共升了12位至世界第四；安全城市排名躋身十大，位列世界第七。

4. 今年的《施政報告》圍繞兩大主軸——經濟和民生。

5. 北部都會區（北都）是香港經濟發展的新引擎，有龐大潛力。我會加快發展北都，成立由我領導的「北都發展委員會」，制訂北都各發展區的營運模式，推動大學城建設；拆牆鬆綁簡化行政程序；採取安全省時省錢的建造方法；及訂立加快發展北都的專屬法律。政府會引入和培育產業，創造職位和提升生產力，並制訂優惠政策包，以更快、更靈活的方式與產業商討落戶細節，創造更多高收入的優質職位及提升生產力。

6. 在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有「引進來、走出去」的獨特優勢。過往我們較着重「引進來」，香港從中亦得益不少，但香港未來的新機遇將更集中在「走出去」。這倍速增量的機遇轉變源自全球貿易秩序重塑，內地企業不再聚焦單一國家，而轉向積極開拓新興市場。政府會把握香港出口平台優勢，鞏固香港國際中心地位，發揮金融、貿易、專業服務、供應鏈管理、專業網絡等優勢，創造就業和收入，進一步推動總部經濟，帶來更多商機；我們亦會以教育、科技、人才一體化發展，同時推動文體旅協同發展，讓市民生活在經濟蓬勃、文化活力的社區。

7. 為進一步強化治理，我會建立「部門首長責任制」，將其承擔部門主體責任的機制系統化、制度化，並強化公務員評核機制，深化不斷求進的文化。我亦會成立「AI效能提升組」，統籌和指導各政府部門有效應用人工智能（AI）技術，並研究重組不合時宜的工作流程，推動科技革新。同時，在重視防範安全風險的意識下，推進AI+發展，落實AI政務，以及促進AI在各行業的廣泛應用和發展，提升社會效率。此外，我會實踐「把『高效市場』和『有為政府』更好結合起來」的理念，在康樂及文化事務署（康文署）服務中引入市場營運模式，提升服務水平。

8. 《施政報告》以民生為壓軸專章，是篇幅最大的一章，涵蓋土地房屋、交通運輸、醫療護理、社會福利、保障勞工、關愛共融等九個與市民生活息息相關的重要範疇。當中包括持續增加公營房屋供應，豐富置業階梯；持續造地以滿足大型發展項目、長期經濟發展和市民住屋的需要，同時增加政府土地儲備；持續深化醫療改革；推出十一項措施支援本地經濟、繼續精準扶貧、推廣「居家安老為本、院舍照顧為後援」方針，支援和保障勞工，以及成立「社會高齡化對策工作組」應對高齡化的挑戰等。這些都是體現我以民生為最終施政目標的理念。發展經濟，就是為了民生福祉，讓市民過更好的生活。

9. 感謝市民在諮詢期間提供的寶貴意見，並大致認同我的施政方針和政策。《施政報告》詳細闡述施政目標、關鍵措施及績效指標，我同時制定附篇，細列其他措施及事宜。

Speech by CE at Investopia Global - Hong Kong 2025 (English only) (with video),2025-09-17 10:00,2025-09-17 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/17/P2025091600474.htm,"ããâFollowing is the video speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Investopia Global - Hong Kong 2025 today (September 17):

Your Excellency Minister Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri (Minister of Economy of United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Chairman of Investopia), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

â  It is my great pleasure to be part of the Investopia Global Hong Kong today. I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the United Arab Emirates, for bringing this forward-looking platform to Hong Kong. I would also like to extend a very warm welcome to our friends from the UAE and around the globe.

  Since its launch in 2021, Investopia has developed into a remarkable global network. It connects investors, entrepreneurs and policymakers, fostering dialogue and creating opportunities across regions. Staging this platform in Hong Kong, for the first time, is testament to the deepening partnership between Hong Kong and the UAE.

  The UAE is now Hong Kong's largest trading partner in the Middle East, and Hong Kong the UAE's seventh largest trading partner in the world. Our growing economic and trade ties are built on shared values of openness and fairness, and our vision of sustainable development.

  In 2023, I had the honour of leading a high-level business delegation to visit the beautiful country of UAE. More than its friendly hospitality, I was impressed by the ambition, energy and drive of the country's booming economy.

  During the visit, we concluded seven co-operation agreements between Hong Kong and the UAE. Apart from formal agreements, we have also built a strong friendship with our counterparts in the UAE, unleashing tremendous potential of our co-operation. And today's gathering, I'm pleased to say, is another big step forward in unleashing that potential.

  Both Hong Kong and the UAE stand as global business hubs in strategic locations. Whereas Hong Kong connects investors with China, our country, and the Asia-Pacific, the UAE links the world with the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Together, we can form an alliance of commerce that spans continents to generate investment synergy.

  Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage. We are the freest economy in the world, and one of the world's three most competitive economies. Our long tradition of the rule of law, and a common law system that dovetails with most global financial hubs, provide key assurances to a world of investors.

  As an international financial, shipping and trade centre, Hong Kong has the infrastructure and services that provide key support to the international trade order. Our advanced ports, airports and logistics systems enhance efficiency in trade flows, supporting cross-border e-commerce and building supply chains that are fit for the future. And with the strengthened co-operation between Hong Kong and the UAE, I am confident that we will continue to witness more dual listings, increased cross-border capital flows and collaboration in green and sustainable finance.

  Hong Kong offers business-friendly policies to foreign enterprises, those from the UAE very much included. By setting up your offices here, your companies can enjoy more flexibility and convenience when doing business on the Mainland, under the updated Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement. Our proximity to the Mainland and various travel facilitation schemes also means that it is easy to visit your business partners on the Mainland for meetings, conferences, or simply a cup of coffee.

  Innovation is another promising area. Both our economies invest heavily in start-ups, global talent and ecosystems that inspire innovation and creativity. In Hong Kong, our expanding green technology sector and science parks are building momentum. These efforts connect well with the UAE's Hub71 and other accelerators.

  With this shared commitment to excellence, it comes as no surprise that in the latest World Talent Ranking, both Hong Kong and the UAE soared to their highest-ever positions. Hong Kong climbed 12 positions in two years to come fourth in the ranking, while the UAE took a whopping 12-place leap over two years to come ninth.

  Published by the International Institute for Management Development last week, the report recognised the outstanding performance of both the UAE and Hong Kong, stating that our targeted reforms and investment have resulted in significant gains in talent competitiveness over time.

  Ladies and gentlemen, as we chart the path ahead, Hong Kong will continue to serve as both a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" for investors from the UAE and the world. Together with the UAE, we will build deeper connections and create greater values for businesses, investors and entrepreneurs around the world in times of global economic uncertainty. 

  I look forward to welcoming more overseas enterprises and capital to Hong Kong in the years ahead, transforming opportunities into lasting success.

  I wish you all the best of business and every success here and beyond. Thank you."

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-09-17 06:02,2025-09-17 06:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/17/P2025091700142.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (September 17) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

An investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

大家好！今晚很高興出席香港醫療衞生界慶祝中華人民共和國成立76周年酒會，與大家共賀國慶。

今個月初，國家舉行紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年活動。紀念活動警示世人要和睦相處、消弭戰爭根源，不能讓歷史悲劇重演。活動也突出了中華民族的氣節和團結，為國家生存而戰、為民族復興而戰、為人類正義而戰的偉大精神。主席的重要講話總結說：「中華民族偉大復興勢不可擋！人類和平與發展的崇高事業必將勝利！」這番說話在國慶七十六周年即將到臨之際，尤具關聯意義。如今，我國在經濟、貿易、科技、基建、文化體育、軍事、外交等多個領域舉足輕重。就以經濟貿易而言，國家已是全球第二大經濟體、第一大工業國、第一大貨物貿易國和第一大外匯儲備國。這些成就，讓海內外全體中華兒女都感到無比自豪。國家必定越來越強盛，香港的未來也必定越來越璀璨。

面對人口老化、慢性疾病日益普遍的問題，現屆特區政府積極推行醫療改革，推動基層醫療發展，將過往「重治療、輕預防」扭轉為「以預防為重、以家庭為中心、以社區為本」，積極改善市民整體健康水平。政府的「慢病共治計劃」自二○二三年十一月推行至今，已有超過15萬市民參加計劃，其中完成篩查的逾九萬人中，約有四成人士被診斷為血糖偏高、或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂。推動基層醫療，不僅能更有效守護和促進市民健康，也能減輕疾病對醫療系統和社會造成的負擔。

特區政府會繼續深化醫療體系改革，全面審視醫療體系的定位和目標。在醫療方面，政府會支持本港醫院進行《國際醫院評審認證標準（中國）》評審認證，以持續提升醫療質量。在醫藥方面，政府努力發展香港成為國際醫療創新樞紐，藉改革藥械審批制度，提升本港臨床試驗能力，並善用河套區策略性位置，發揮好「一國兩制」優勢。

在提供高質醫療服務和推進醫療改革的過程中，醫療衞生界的每一位都是積極的參與者，各個醫療專業各司其職，一同守護市民健康。今年特別值得期待的是中醫藥發展。年底，政府會發布香港首份《中醫藥發展藍圖》，香港首間中醫醫院也將於十二月起分階段啟用，而政府中藥檢測中心永久大樓於今年十二月的啟用亦會推動檢測科研、教育和國際交流等工作。我也呼籲大家積極參與十二月舉行的「第七屆粵港澳大灣區中醫藥傳承創新發展大會」這個大灣區中醫界和整個香港醫療衞生界的盛事。

最後，我祝祖國富強昌盛、山河無恙、人民永好，香港則繁榮安定、市民幸福安康。多謝大家。"

胡忠勇部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室行政財務部部長）、Stanley會長（特許公認會計師公會香港分會會長何家輝）、Wilson會長（特許公認會計師公會香港分會新任會長鄭傑燊）、各位ACCA HK的朋友、各位嘉賓：

大家晚上好！我很高興回到「娘家」，出席ACCA HK成立75周年的慶祝晚宴。見到許多好朋友、好拍檔，實在感到很開心。自75年前在香港設立分會以來，ACCA一直走在會計專業發展的最前線，培育了無數優秀的會計專才，為香港、內地以至亞洲區內的經濟發展作出了不少的貢獻。

多年來，ACCA推動財會專業水平的提升，以及行業的持續發展，並積極向政府建言獻策，助力香港的經濟和社會發展。不論是每年的《施政報告》還是《財政預算案》，都向政府提交專業、客觀、切合當時社會狀況的建議。在可持續發展與創新方面，ACCA更發揮了前瞻作用，例如推動綠色金融和踐行負責任的商業經營等。

剛才兩位會長都有提及ACCA「Think Ahead」的核心價值。能夠前瞻思考，從未來看今天，是專業會計師在瞬息萬變的時代中保持競爭力的關鍵。當前全球政經格局正深刻重塑，科技創新尤其人工智能帶來了顛覆性的變革、競爭力被重新定義，這對會計專業帶來甚麽變化？是挑戰還是機遇？

是的，挑戰與機遇並存，但我個人是比較樂觀的。讓我扼要分享三點觀察。

第一，地緣政治令多邊自由貿易體制轉向區域性的經濟發展，區域內經濟體以共同利益深化協作，而區域與區域之間則可能出現更多貿易壁壘、存在更大的競爭。與此同時，國家推動高水平雙向對外開放的發展戰略，越來越多內地企業加快「走出去」的步伐，積極在全球布局供應鏈、產業鏈，尤其是在全球南方國家和地區，例如東南亞和中東。此舉既是用好自身在內地的產能，同時又參與國際產業分工與合作。這過程讓香港的會計師可以一展身手。例如協助內地企業來港上市或發債，籌募資金支持其海外業務的發展，並以香港這個高端服務平台處理財資、稅務和合規事務，各位同業可發揮自身所長，以及國際視野與專業網絡，協助內地企業壯大發展。與此同時，隨着國家高水平雙向開放戰略的深化，在東南亞、中東、中亞等地的企業亦越來越倚重香港作為平台，進行國際融資和進入內地市場。

上述這些發展正為會計專業朋友們開展一個更廣闊的事業舞台，但也同時對大家提出了更高的專業能力要求，例如跨地域的服務能力和對多元文化了解的軟實力。

第二，人工智能（AI）的快速發展正以前所未有的速度重塑各行各業，會計行業亦不例外。AI技術能夠自動處理大量重複性的工作流程，而且其學習、分析與決策能力不斷提升，會計師們必須好好把握這個工具，並思考如何更多地參與高增值、AI難以取替的職能。因此，提升數碼素養、擁抱科技轉型、確保服務質素、誠信與堅守專業操守，已成為會計師持續學習與發展的核心要素。

第三，雖然當前全球在應對氣候變化方面面對種種挑戰，個別國家甚至出現承諾倒退的情況，但亞洲地區，特別是中國，依然堅定推進綠色轉型與可持續發展。事實上，這是不可逆轉的歷史潮流，人類的共同未來，會計專業在這一轉型進程中將發揮越來越重要的角色，包括參與制定和完善相關項目的分類、財務匯報與審計，以至協助企業進行風險評估、合規審查等諮詢，提升其整體可持續表現等。隨着企業、投資者、監管機構對ESG（環境、社會和企業管治）資訊的重視日增，會計專業的價值與影響力亦將提升。

可以說，無論是區域經濟的發展、科技的變革，還是綠色和可持續發展的推進，都為會計界帶來廣闊的發展空間與多元化發展機遇。這是一個必須把握的風起雲湧時代。

在事業發展之餘，相信大家都會不忘初心，積極貢獻社會。我記得在擔任ACCA HK會長期間，發起人力車大賽慈善籌款活動。多年來這活動凝聚了業界的力量，為本地規模較小的慈善團體籌募善款。我一直深信，會計師既是嚴謹的商業規範守護者，也是建設關愛共融社會的踐行者。希望大家繼續在追求專業卓越的同時，積極參與公益事務，共建一個更有溫度的社區。

最後，藉此機會，我感謝Stanley會長過去一年來的出色帶領，並祝願即將接任的Wilson會長繼續帶領ACCA HK勇創高峰。再次祝賀ACCA香港鑽禧紀念活動圓滿成功，會務竿頭猛進，各位朋友身體健康，事業宏達，多謝大家。"

大家晚上好！我很高興回到「娘家」，出席ACCA HK成立75周年的慶祝晚宴。見到許多好朋友、好拍檔，實在感到很開心。自75年前在香港設立分會以來，ACCA一直走在會計專業發展的最前線，培育了無數優秀的會計專才，為香港、內地以至亞洲區內的經濟發展作出了不少的貢獻。

多年來，ACCA推動財會專業水平的提升，以及行業的持續發展，並積極向政府建言獻策，助力香港的經濟和社會發展。不論是每年的《施政報告》還是《財政預算案》，都向政府提交專業、客觀、切合當時社會狀況的建議。在可持續發展與創新方面，ACCA更發揮了前瞻作用，例如推動綠色金融和踐行負責任的商業經營等。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-16 20:14,2025-09-16 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600707.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 16), onenew case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

The case involves a 39-year-old female living in Kowloon City District. Preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Jiangmen in Guangdong alone between September 7 and 9. She developed a fever and joint pain from September 15. She attended Queen Elizabeth Hospitalon the same day and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

She has 10 household contacts. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

Since the patient stayed in Jiangmen during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 18 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

 According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 201 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (September 7 to 13), similar to the previous two weeks, which reported 178 cases (August 31 to September 6) and 225 cases (August 24 to 30) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other regions that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, etc. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââ
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
Heritage Museum to stage exhibition commemorating 120th anniversary of Lingnan School of Painting master painter Chao Shao-an's birth (with photos),2025-09-16 20:09,2025-09-16 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600336.htm,"  This year marks the 120th anniversary of the birth of Professor Chao Shao-an, a master painter of the Lingnan School of Painting. The Hong Kong Heritage Museum (HKHM) is presenting the exhibition ""Legacy of Lingnan School of Painting: In Commemoration of the 120th Anniversary of the Birth of Chao Shao-an"" from tomorrow (September 17), showcasing 120 works of art by ProfessorChao spanning the 1930s to the 1990s. Apart from representative works donated by ProfessorChao to the HKHM, the exhibition showcases important works on loan from local museums and private collectors, as well as collections from ProfessorChao's family for the first time, taking visitors on a retrospective journey into ProfessorChao's artistic career from multiple perspectives. The works highlight his influence and contribution to the development of Chinese painting in the 20th century.

  Addressing the opening ceremony today (September 16), the Acting Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Miss Eve Tam, said that with the support of the National 14th Five-Year Plan, Hong Kong is committed to developing into an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchanges. Hong Kong has the distinctive advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" framework, enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, to promote outstanding traditional Chinese culture. Professor Chao also held the same belief in using Hong Kong as a base to promote the art of Chinese painting, and to introduce the Lingnan School of Painting to places all over the world. This exhibition is a continuation of Professor Chao's vision to bring Chinese culture and traditional paintings and calligraphy to the world.

  The son of ProfessorChao, Mr Chiu Chi-tai, who was a guest at the opening ceremony, said that his father's donation of important works to the HKHM in his later years reflects the relationship between the two. For many years, the HKHM has been a champion of his father's artistic achievements and the Lingnan School of Painting. This year, in particular, the HKHM curated this meaningful exhibition in commemoration of his late father's 120th birthday. By highlighting representative works from different periods of his career, it allows visitors to retrace his father's footsteps as an artist and offers a rare glimpse into the impressive legacy of the Lingnan School of Painting.

  Other officiating guests included the Chairman of the Art Sub-committee of the Museum Advisory Committee, Professor Desmond Hui; Expert Adviser on Literary Arts for the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) Professor Richard Ho; and the Museum Director of the HKHM, Mr Brian Lam.

  ProfessorChao (1905-1998) dedicated himself to ""modernising Chinese painting"" as advocated by the Lingnan School of Painting. He devoted himself to maintaining the spirit of traditional Chinese painting while at the same time adopting and adapting the best of both Eastern and Western art. ProfessorChao placed a special emphasis on ""painting from life"", which enabled him to develop a highly personal artistic style. In addition to offering his masterpieces to museums as gifts for the benefit of society and the world of art, ProfessorChao also nurtured the development of many disciples. Under his influence, the Lingnan School gained popularity and became an important School of Chinese painting in the 20th century.

  ProfessorChao's bird-and-flower paintings are highly esteemed. Renowned Chinese painter Xu Beihong praised him as ""the foremost bird-and-flower painter in modern China"". This exhibition presents a fine selection of ProfessorChao's representative bird-and-flower works, such as ""Moonlight Over the Pond"", which illustrates his mastery of artistic ambience; ""White Peacock"", a masterpiece showcasing his exquisitely meticulous brushwork; and ""Plantain Trees"", a large-scale five-panel painting rarely seen in traditional Chinese painting.

  The exhibition is organised along three themes: ""Friendships with His Peers in Art"", ""Artistic Journey Modelling from Nature"" and ""Footprints from a Life of Travel"". It showcases a carefully curated selection of ProfessorChao's works, including bird-and-flower, insect and animal, and landscape paintings. It also includes paintings which are gifts made to ProfessorChao by renowned Chinese painters Qi Baishi and Xu Beihong on loan from his family for the first time, and precious videos of the master giving painting demonstrations.

  Moreover, the exhibition presents a special multimedia display created by Hong Kong artist Thomas Siu, who takes inspiration from ProfessorChao's bird-and-flower paintings, and animates ProfessorChao's floral paintings, immersing viewers in a wonderland of Lingnan blossoms.

  In addition to the exhibition, the HKHM is organising a series of special programmes with free admission, including sketching workshops, talks, and guided tours, which enable participants to understand the characteristics of the Lingnan School of Painting from different perspectives.

  The HKHM received a generous donation of masterpieces from ProfessorChao in 1995, leading to the establishment of the Chao Shao-an Gallery. The HKHM is the art institution with the world's largest collection of ProfessorChao's works. Through the HKHM's acquisitions, as well as contributions of precious paintings and archives from the ProfessorChao's family and his students over the years, the HKHM has become a key resource for studying ProfessorChao's art.

  The exhibition, presented by the LCSD and organised by the HKHM, runs from September 17 to February 23 next year at the Chao Shao-an Gallery, Thematic Galleries 3 and 4, 1/F, the HKHM. Admission is free. For details of the exhibition and special programmes, please visit the website at hk.heritage.museum/en/web/hm/exhibitions/data/csa_120a.html.

  The exhibition is a contribution programme of the 5th Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Culture and Arts Festival, and is one of the activities in the Chinese Culture Promotion Series."
香港文化博物館舉行嶺南畫派大師趙少昂誕辰120周年紀念展（附圖）,2025-09-16 20:08,2025-09-16 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600335.htm,"今年適值嶺南畫派大師趙少昂教授誕辰120周年，香港文化博物館明日（九月十七日）起舉辦「嶺南風範：趙少昂誕辰一百二十周年紀念展」，展出120幅趙少昂教授由上世紀三十年代至九十年代的作品。展覽除了展出趙少昂教授捐贈予香港文化博物館的代表作外，更首次匯集多家本地文博機構及私人藏家借出的重要作品，以及由其家人首度借出的珍藏，以多元角度回顧他的藝術歷桯，展現他對二十世紀中國繪畫發展的影響和成就。

署理康樂及文化事務署（康文署）署長譚美兒今日（九月十六日）在展覽開幕典禮上致辭時表示，在國家「十四五」規劃的支持下，香港正全力發展成為中外文化藝術交流中心，憑藉「一國兩制」、背靠祖國和聯通世界的優勢，積極弘揚中華優秀傳統文化。趙少昂教授當年亦秉持同一信念，以香港為基地，推廣中國繪畫藝術，並將嶺南畫派介紹到世界各地。這次展覽正是延續趙少昂教授的精神，讓中華文化和傳統書畫走向世界。

趙少昂教授哲嗣趙之泰在開幕典禮上致辭時表示，父親在晚年把重要作品捐贈予香港文化博物館，體現父親與博物館的深厚情誼。香港文化博物館多年來不遺餘力地推廣父親的藝術與支持嶺南畫派的發展。今年時值父親趙少昂教授誕辰120週年之際，館方特別籌辦這場紀念展，匯聚了父親不同時期的經典作品，讓大家再次回溯父親的藝術人生足跡，和一覽嶺南畫派的豐碩成果。

其他主禮嘉賓包括博物館諮詢委員會藝術專責委員會主席許焯權教授、康文署文學藝術專業顧問何文匯教授和香港文化博物館總館長林國輝。

趙少昂教授（一九○五至一九九八）秉持嶺南畫派「國畫現代化」的目標，致力結合中國傳統繪畫的精神，並廣泛吸收東西方繪畫的養分，以寫生為基礎，建立獨特的個人藝術風格。他除了將畢生精品化私為公，捐贈予博物館，亦熱心藝術教育，桃李滿門。嶺南畫派在其發揚下，成為二十世紀流布最廣泛的中國繪畫流派。

趙少昂教授的花鳥畫受藝術界高度讚揚，中國著名畫家徐悲鴻曾稱頌「趙君花鳥為中國現代第一人」。展覽精選了他的花鳥畫作精品，其中《迷濛月色滿橫塘》盡顯其精於營造意境的功力、《霜光素羽》則顯現大師精湛的細膩筆觸，更有傳統國畫罕見的巨幅五聯屏《芭蕉》等。

展覽以「藝林友儕的交誼」、「師法自然的藝途」、「一生遊歷的足跡」三個主題，涵蓋趙少昂教授的花鳥、草蟲、走獸和山水作品，更有趙少昂教授家人首度借出齊白石、徐悲鴻等國畫大師送贈予趙少昂教授的珍藏畫作，並展出大師示範繪畫的珍貴錄像片段。

此外，展覽特設由香港藝術家蕭劍英受趙少昂教授花鳥畫所啓發而設計的沉浸式多媒體展示區，將趙少昂教授的花卉作品轉化為動畫場景，引領觀眾走進絢爛的嶺南花境。

除了展覽，香港文化博物館亦舉行一系列免費特備節目，包括寫生工作坊、講座和導賞，讓參加者從不同角度認識嶺南畫派的特色。

香港文化博物館於一九九五年獲趙少昂教授慷慨捐贈其經典作品，促成館內設立「趙少昂藝術館」，亦是全球擁有趙少昂教授作品最多的藝術機構。多年來，香港文化博物館通過購藏，以及蒙其家人和弟子惠贈珍貴畫作及資料，成為研究趙少昂教授藝術的重要寶庫。

展覽由康文署主辦，香港文化博物館籌劃，展期由九月十七日至明年二月二十三日，在香港文化博物館一樓趙少昂藝術館、專題展覽館三及四舉行，免費入場。有關展覽和特備節目詳情，可瀏覽網頁hk.heritage.museum/tc/web/hm/exhibitions/data/csa_120a.html。

展覽為第五屆粤港澳大灣區文化藝術節響應節目，亦是弘揚中華文化系列活動之一。"
CHP urges students to receive seasonal influenza vaccination early in new school year as one case of severe paediatric influenza A infection reported,2025-09-16 20:08,2025-09-16 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600706.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 16) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection. The CHP urged the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times. Schools and parents should arrange their students and children to participate in the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) programme and receive free SIV to prevent contracting respiratory illnesses.

The case involved a 3-year-old girl with underlying illnesses. She developed a fever, cough and shortness of breath yesterday (September 15). She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital and was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit of the hospital on the same day. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia. She is still hospitalised and is in serious condition.

The CHP investigation showed that one of her household contacts, who was infected with influenza A last week, sought medical attention and did not require hospitalisation. She had not received the 2024/25 SIV. There has been no recent influenza outbreak at the school she studied.

Besides, Hong Kong has entered the summer influenza season, outbreaks of influenza-like illness (ILI) in schools and residential care homes have significantly increased in the past two weeks. Since September (as of September 15), there have been 104 outbreaks involving schools, including kindergartens/child care centres (14 cases), primary schools (56 cases) and secondary schools (34 cases).

The DH announced that the 2025/26 SIV Programmes would commence on September 25 to provide a free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. A number ofnew initiativeshave been introduced to encourage and enable public participation, including further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme so that all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools being allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities.

To make vaccinations more accessible, the Government will open all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the 25 District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission, and 74 general outpatient clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Starting from 9am on September 22, parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system.

The CHP reminded high-risk persons to wear surgical masks when visiting public places. The general public should also wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly, and consider whether to go to work or school. For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages. "
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-16 19:50,2025-09-16 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600670.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月十六日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

病人為39歲女子，住所位於九龍城區。初步調查顯示，她於九月七日至九日獨自到訪廣東省江門市。她由九月十五日開始出現發燒和關節痛，同日到伊利沙伯醫院求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

她有10名家居接觸者，現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期曾身處江門市，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得18宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（九月七日至十三日）廣東省新增201宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別178宗（八月三十一日至九月六日）及225宗（八月二十四日至三十日）相若。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。雖然廣東省基孔肯雅熱的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。​

Hong Kong Customs special operation combats sale of counterfeit mooncakes and other goods (with photo),2025-09-16 19:37,2025-09-16 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600559.htm,"Hong Kong Customs mounted a special operation between August 27 and September 16 to combat the sale of counterfeit mooncakes and other goods. About 170 boxes of suspected counterfeit mooncakes and more than 3 700 items of suspected counterfeit goods, including apparel, accessories, proprietary Chinese medicines, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare products, with an estimated market value of about $1 million were seized. Two persons were arrested.

Customs earlier examined a 40-foot container, arriving in Hong Kong from the Mainland and declared to be containing vehicle parts, at the Tuen Mun River Trade Terminal Customs Cargo Examination Compound. About 96 boxes of suspected counterfeit mooncakes and about 1 000 items of suspected counterfeit goods were seized. An initial investigation revealed that the batch of suspected counterfeit mooncakes would have been transshipped to overseas regions.

In addition, Customs carried out spot checks and inspection in various districts, and detected that suspected counterfeit mooncakes were put on sale in shops. With the assistance of the trademark owners, Customs officers took enforcement action and raided two retail shops. About 74 boxes of suspected counterfeit mooncakes and about 2 700 items of suspected counterfeit goods were seized.

During the operation, two persons involved in the case were arrested.

The investigation is ongoing, and the likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

With the Mid-Autumn Festival around the corner, Customs will continue to step up inspections and enforcement to vigorously combat different kinds of counterfeiting activities.

Customs reminds consumers to procure goods at reputable shops and to check with the trademark owners or their authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt. Traders should also be cautious and prudent in merchandising since selling counterfeit goods is a serious crime and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who sells or possesses for sale any goods with a forged trademark commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected counterfeiting activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

A development framework supported by 'three major I&T parks' and 'five key R&D institutions' is taking shape. Meanwhile, the Government has launched a series of conducive policy initiatives to consolidate Hong Kong's strengths in basic research, accelerate the midstream technology transfer and commercialisation of R&D outcomes, and foster the development of the I&T industry. Developing I&T requires sustained capital investment and talent support. Hong Kong's leading rankings in the 'Credit', 'Investment', 'Tertiary Education' and 'Knowledge Absorption' sub-pillars fully demonstrate that Hong Kong is well positioned to continuously advance in innovation. We will continue to enhance the I&T ecosystem and attract global I&T resources and talent, with a view to developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre at full steam.""

尊敬的陳副院長（國家法官學院副院長陳春梅）、鄭書記（國家法官學院紀委書記鄭汝軍）、魏主席（香港城市大學校董會主席魏名成（明德））、李副校長（香港城市大學首席及常務副校長李振聲教授）、林院長（香港城市大學法律學院院長林峰教授）、各位法官、各位嘉賓：

大家下午好。感謝香港城市大學的邀請，我很榮幸出席今日的中國高級法官法學博士、中國法官法學碩士及中國高級法官研修班課程開班典禮。我對今日課程順利開班表示熱烈祝賀，對各位來自內地的高級法官和法官表示熱烈歡迎！

香港城市大學，特別是法律學院和司法教育與研究暨香港法律查明中心，多年來與最高人民法院和國家法官學院等機構合作，為內地法官舉辦不同形式和範疇的培訓課程，成果有目共睹，經驗毋庸置疑，我對此表示十分讚賞和感謝。

律政司一直支持促進內地與香港法律交流互鑑和人才培養的工作，並且扮演着越來越重要的角色。我認為這是全面準確貫徹落實「一國兩制」的其中一個關鍵點，也就是要把香港與內地法律制度之間的「制度之異」轉化為「制度之利」，讓兩地司法界、法律部門和法律及爭議解決業界加強交流溝通，理解彼此的法律思想、制度和慣常做法等，從而互學互鑑，促進兩地法治的共同發展。所以律政司其中一項重要政策範疇，就是發揮和鞏固香港作為國家唯一中英雙語普通法司法管轄區和國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位，為粵港澳大灣區以至內地培養更多具有國際視野，熟悉國際法、普通法和大陸法的涉外法律人才，以香港法律能力建設中心之長，助力國家建設涉外法律人才隊伍。

律政司於去年十一月成立香港國際法律人才培訓學院，並在今年一月與最高人民法院成功合辦了香港普通法司法實務研修班，研修班是培訓學院啓動後首個舉辦的課程。我們透過香港視角，為內地法官介紹普通法的思考模式、法律邏輯及實際運作。我們很高興看到香港的講者，包括法官、司法人員和資深法律界人士與內地法官就不同課題進行了深入交流，真正做到教學相長。我相信城市大學法律學院各位教授和講師對此必定深有同感。展望未來，我們會致力與本港各大院校的法律學院和法律界等攜手，繼續支持內地司法界透過多方面的培訓，深度探索不同課題，增加司法人員對處理涉外，特別是涉港案件的信心，助力國家涉外法治建設。

各位參與今日開班典禮的法官，再次歡迎你們蒞臨香港，希望各位通過課堂和參訪交流豐富法律知識之餘，也能建立友誼和感受香港的活力，學成以後成為兩地法律制度之間的橋樑紐帶。我理解一如以往，城市大學安排了參加高級法官研修班的法官後日訪問律政司，先跟你們打個招呼，我的團隊非常期待和你們見面交流。

最後，我祝願課程順利開展，大家生活愉快。謝謝。"

十一月起進一步優化的士筆試,2025-09-16 18:24,2025-09-16 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091200666.htm,"運輸署今日（九月十六日）宣布，由今年十一月起進一步優化的士筆試，在維持評估水平的同時，更切合的士業界的實際運作需要。

的士筆試主要考核考生對的士營運規例、主要地點和路線，以及《道路使用者守則》等實務知識的掌握。為與時並進，運輸署在全面檢討考核安排後，將由今年十一月三日起優化的士筆試（不論首次應考或重考）如下：


合併現時甲部「的士則例」和乙部「地方及路線試題」為新的甲部「的士營運」，考核的士司機的實務知識，包括相關法規及基本地方知識；
現有丙部《道路使用者守則》成為新的乙部，繼續考核對《守則》的認識；
考慮到現時的導航科技已能協助的士司機快速尋找目的地及規劃最佳行駛路線，的士筆試會大幅減少和簡化有關著名地方和路線識別的試題，而試題庫亦會更新，令考核能更切合實務需要，同時確保通過考核的考生具備的士司機所需專業知識和素養，且對主要道路網絡及常到的地點有基本認知和掌握；
的士筆試亦會加入新試題，以考核考生對提升的士服務質素的一系列新措施（例如的士車隊制度、的士司機違例記分制度等）的認識；及
整體試題數目由90條調整至75條，各部及格標準和考試時間維持不變。


運輸署於二○二○年二月改進的士筆試，更新考核內容和調整試題數目，以更集中考核關於的士服務的核心知識，成功吸引更多人報考的士筆試。應考人數在過去數年大幅增加四成，由二○一九年的不足10000人增加至二○二四年的接近14000人。另外，的士筆試的及格率亦由二○一九年的37%提升至二○二四年的60%，反映優化的士筆試對吸引新人投身的士司機行業有相當正面的作用。

署方已諮詢的士服務質素委員會跨專業、跨界別包括的士業界的成員，並會向的士業界發信，介紹新筆試的考核範圍。署方會陸續向考生派發新的《的士筆試指引》及《的士營運小冊子》，考生稍後亦可參閱運輸署網頁。"
Taxi Written Test to be further enhanced from November,2025-09-16 18:24,2025-09-16 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091200673.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (September 16) that the Taxi Written Test will be further enhanced from November 2025 to better align with the practical needs of the taxi trade while maintaining the level of assessment.

  The Taxi Written Test focuses on assessing candidates' practical knowledge of the guidelines and regulations related to taxi operation, key locations and routes, as well as the Road Users' Code. To keep up with the times and after conducting a comprehensive review of the arrangements of the Test, the TD will enhance the Taxi Written Test (regardless of test for fresh candidates or repeaters) starting from November 3, 2025, as follows:


Merging the existing Part A ""Taxi Regulations"" and Part B ""Location and Route Questions"" as the new Part A ""Taxi Operation"" to test taxi drivers' practical knowledge, including relevant legislation as well as basic location knowledge;
The current Part C ""Road Users' Code"" will become the new Part B to continue to test their knowledge ofthe Code;
Having considered that modern navigation technology can now assist taxi drivers in quickly locating destinations and planning the most efficient driving routes, the Taxi Written Test will substantially reduce and simplify the questions on prominent locations and route identification, and the question bank will also be updated, with a view to better aligning the Test with practical needs and ensuring that the candidates who pass the test possess the necessary professional knowledge and qualities of taxi driversand have a basic understanding and grasp of the major road networks and frequently visited locations;
The Taxi Written Test will also include new questions to assess candidates' knowledge of the series of new measures introduced for enhancing taxi service quality (e.g. taxi fleet regime, the Taxi-Driver-Offence Points system); and
The total number of test questions will be adjusted from 90 to 75. The passing criteria for each part and the test duration will remain unchanged.


  The TD improved the Taxi Written Test in February 2020 by updating the test content and adjusting the number of questions, giving a better focus on the assessment of core knowledge regarding taxi services, which successfully attracted more people to apply for the Test. The number of candidates sitting the Test has increased significantly by 40 per cent in the past few years, from less than 10000 candidates in 2019 to around 14000 candidates in 2024. In addition, the passing rate of the Taxi Written Test rose from 37 per cent in 2019 to 60 per cent in 2024, showing that the enhancement of the Taxi Written Test has brought a notably positive effect in attracting newcomers to join the taxi driver profession.

  The TD has consulted the Committee on Taxi Service Quality comprising members from diverse professions and sectors, including the taxi trade, and will issue letters to the taxi trade on the scope of the new Written Test. The TD will distribute the updated Guide to Taxi Written Test and Taxi Operation Booklet to candidates, and they can also refer to the TD's website later."

The maximum fee for metered parking will be adjusted from $2 per 15 minutes to $4 per 15 minutes, i.e. a maximum fee of $16 per hour, with a view to increasing the turnover of vehicles using metered parking spaces, so that their supply can better meet the short-term parking needs of motorists. Fees for metered parking spaces for goods vehicles, buses and coaches will remain unchanged at the existing level.

  The TD will update relevant systems to ensure the smooth implementation of new fees and remind motorists of the new fees via the HKeToll and HKeMobility mobile applications respectively. Motorists can also refer to the TD's webpage on tunnel tolls and parking meters for details."

​教育局局長嘉許資歷架構夥伴（附圖）,2025-09-16 17:55,2025-09-16 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600239.htm,"教育局局長蔡若蓮博士今日（九月十六日）主持「資歷架構夥伴嘉許典禮2025」，向94間企業及53間教育及培訓機構頒發嘉許狀，以表揚他們對推行資歷架構的支持和貢獻。

蔡若蓮博士致辭時表示，資歷架構自二○○八年推行以來穩步發展，獲各界廣泛應用及認受，實有賴業界、專業團體、教育及培訓機構等合作夥伴的鼎力支持。她感謝各行業培訓諮詢委員會（諮委會）全體委員多年來積極參與建構及推廣資歷架構的工作，並期望各界繼續攜手推廣資歷架構的應用，促進終身學習，提升人力質素，並推動行業及社會的持續發展。

目前，資歷架構下已為23個行業成立諮委會，涵蓋的行業從業員人數佔本港整體勞動人口逾半。這些行業均已制訂《能力標準說明》，其中19個行業亦已設立「過往資歷認可」機制，另有13個行業建立了「職業資歷階梯」。

教育局會與各持份者合作，推動資歷架構繼續發展，當中包括加快發展「職業資歷階梯」，目標是在二○二七年底前涵蓋最少18個行業。教育局亦會繼續以「職學聯通、多元發展」的策略，善用資歷架構平台，以推廣職業專才教育。

本年度有三位「QF金星級僱主」及91位「QF星級僱主」獲嘉許，表揚他們在下列一個或多個範疇中善用資歷架構的各項工具和配套機制，提升企業的人力質素：

（一）發展公司內部的「職業階梯課程」或「能力為本課程」，以加強學習與工作之間的連繫；

（二）鼓勵員工申請「過往資歷認可」，憑經驗和能力獲得認可資歷；以及

（三）在人力資源發展和管理等範疇上應用認可資歷，協助企業長遠發展和提高競爭力。

此外，有53間「QF星級培訓機構」獲嘉許，以表揚他們在發展「職業階梯課程」、「能力為本課程」、「通用能力為本課程」，或訂立「學分累積及轉移」方面的努力，為學員提供更靈活的進修路徑。另有逾120間機構獲頒「QF星級之友」嘉許狀，以感謝他們積極推廣資歷架構的應用。

典禮亦設有QF in Action計劃（QFIA）嘉許環節，表揚18間機構成為2024 QFIA Achiever，以及31間合作機構成為2024 QFIA Achiever（Partner），創歷年新高，應用層面亦最廣。這些機構在二○二三至二○二四年度積極運用資歷架構，推動人力資源管理、專業發展和職學聯通等項目。蔡若蓮博士期望這些良好範例能啓發更多機構日後應用資歷架構，推動人才發展。

資歷架構是一個七級的資歷級別制度，涵蓋學術、職業專才及持續教育和培訓界別，為有關資歷釐定明確及客觀的標準。資歷架構旨在推動終身學習，持續提升本港工作人口的質素、專業水平及競爭力。"
SED commends Qualifications Framework Partners (with photos),2025-09-16 17:55,2025-09-16 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600241.htm,"The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, today (September 16) officiated at the Qualifications Framework (QF) Partnerships Commendation Ceremony 2025 and presented certificates of commendation to 94 enterprises and 53 education and training organisations in recognition of their support and contributions to the implementation of the QF.

Dr Choi said at the ceremony that since its launch in 2008, the QF has developed steadily with wide application and recognition across various sectors thanks to the unwavering support from partners, including industries, professional bodies, and education and training providers. She expressed her gratitude to all members of various Industry Training Advisory Committees (ITACs) for their active participation in building and promoting the QF over the years, and looks forward to the continued collaboration across sectors to further promote the application of the QF, foster lifelong learning, enhance the quality of manpower, and drive the sustainable development of industries and society as a whole.

At present, ITACs are established for 23 industries under the QF, covering over half of the workforce in Hong Kong. All of these industries have drawn up Specifications of Competency Standards (SCS), among which 19 industries have also implemented the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) mechanism, and 13 have developed Vocational Qualifications Pathways (VQP).

The Education Bureau (EDB) will continue to collaborate with all stakeholders to promote the continued development of the QF, including expediting the development of VQP, with the goal of covering at least 18 industries by the end of 2027. The EDB will also continue to leverage the QF platform to promote vocational and professional education and training through the strategy of fostering industry-institution collaboration and diversified development.

This year, three ""QF Gold Star Employers"" and 91 ""QF Star Employers"" were commended for making good use of the tools and supporting mechanisms of the QF in at least one of the following areas to enhance the quality of human resources within the organisation:

1. Developing VQP courses or SCS-based courses within the companies to enhance the synergy between learning and employment;

2. Encouraging employees to apply for RPL qualifications to have their experience and competencies recognised under the QF; and

3. Using QF-recognised qualifications in areas such as human resources development and management to enhance the competitiveness of the enterprises and support their long-term development.

In addition, 53 ""QF Star Training Providers"" were commended for their efforts in developing VQP courses, SCS-based courses, Specifications of Generic Competencies-based courses, or implementing Credit Accumulation and Transfer, providing learners with more flexible learning pathways. Moreover, over 120 organisations were awarded certificates of ""QF Star Supporter"" in recognition of their active promotion of the application of the QF.

The ceremony also featured a QF in Action (QFIA) commendation session, commending 18 organisations as a 2024 QFIA Achiever and 31 partner organisations as a 2024 QFIA Achiever (Partner), marking a record high in the number of awardees and achieving the broadest applicability. These organisations actively utilised the QF in 2023-2024 to develop projects related to human resource management, professional development, and industry-institution collaboration. Dr Choi envisaged that these exemplary cases would inspire more organisations to adopt the QF in the future and foster talent development.

  The QF is a seven-level hierarchy covering qualifications in the academic, vocational and professional, as well as continuing education and training sectors, defining clear and objective standards applicable to respective qualifications. The primary objective of the QF is to encourage and facilitate lifelong learning, with a view to enhancing the quality, professional capability and competitiveness of the workforce in Hong Kong."

​運輸及物流局局長在立法會《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》委員會會議開場發言（只有中文）,2025-09-16 17:27,2025-09-16 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600576.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（九月十六日）在立法會《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》委員會會議的開場發言：

主席、法案委員會委員：

今日是第一次會議，我和我的團隊很高興出席。相信大家對這課題耳熟能詳，但容許我用幾分鐘時間提綱挈領，談談法案背後的政策理念和重點。

政府在上星期三（九月十日）向立法會提交《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》（《條例草案》），目的是引入網約車服務的規管框架。

規管網約車這個議題相當複雜，涉及不同利益，有關爭議存在多年。今屆特區政府秉持着「以民為本、良性競爭、共存互補」的宗旨，決心引入清晰的法律框架，規管網約車服務。我們希望透過規管網約車服務，讓市民有合法合規的多元化服務，吸引更多年輕司機入行，以及推動整體點對點服務邁向現代化，令市民、司機和整個行業都得益。

我們在今年七月就立法建議的構想諮詢立法會交通事務委員會，通過討論後，議員一致支持政府規管網約車服務，並希望我們全速推進立法工作。為了讓規管制度早日「落地」，政府的策略是先透過《條例草案》確立原則性事宜，並為下一階段的工作提供堅實的法律框架及基礎。我們會在明年上半年透過附屬法例訂定規管的技術細節。

我以下會談談《條例草案》的重點。《條例草案》訂明多項原則性事宜，保障乘客的出行安全和權益，包括要求提供網約車服務的平台、私家車和司機三方都須要領牌。任何一方無牌提供網約車服務，即屬犯罪，須負上刑責。

首先，平台方面，任何提供網約車服務的電子或電訊平台都須要領取網約車服務牌照。持牌平台必須為在香港註冊的公司，並符合指定的入場門檻，以確保它們具備足夠的營運能力。平台須對旗下車輛和司機進行盡職審查、監察司機的服務質素，並向運輸署提交營運紀錄。如果平台違反法定要求或運輸署日後施加的牌照條款，視乎嚴重程度，運輸署可以施加罰款，更改、暫時吊銷或取消牌照。

第二，車輛方面，提供網約車服務的私家車必須持有車輛許可證，並購買合適的第三者風險保險；在申請或每年續領許可證時，車齡須低於12年並符合有關的驗車要求，確保車輛機件安全。我們要求車輛在營運時須展示標識，而提供服務的司機必須為登記車主。這個我們稱為「人車綁定」的安排可避免衍生租賃市場，防止車輛許可證淪為炒賣工具，亦有助加強杜絕黑工司機。

我們在《條例草案》中賦權運輸署署長可就車輛許可證的數目訂明限額，以實施總量控制，避免供應過多而引發負面效果。在下一階段訂定限額時，我們會顧及香港獨特的實際情況，小心審慎地考慮不同因素，包括市民的召車經驗、平台營運需要、公共交通系統生態，以及道路承載力等。

第三，司機方面，我們要求司機必須持有駕駛許可證才可提供網約車服務，並符合指定的條件及完成相關考核。為了便利更多新人加入點對點行業，壯大司機供應，我們建議將來申請的士及網約車駕駛資格的人士可參與同一個筆試。而在引入網約車規管制度和統一筆試前，運輸署剛剛已就現行的士筆試完成全面檢討，並將於今年十一月實施經優化的筆試，加入與提升的士服務質素相關的新措施——例如記分制——的試題，同時回應社會訴求，大幅減少和簡化有關地方和路線的試題，以便讓的士筆試與時並進，更為簡化，切合業界運作需要，相信可積極回應的士業界多年來的訴求。有意加入點對點行業的司機可先參與經優化的的士筆試，取得的士駕駛執照。運輸署將於今日稍後時間發出新聞公報交代詳情。我們建議日後已持有的士駕駛執照的人士，無須再次考試便可向運輸署申請網約車車輛駕駛許可證。有關措施可有助改善司機短缺以及老化的情況，繼而推動點對點行業持續發展。

要求平台、車輛和司機三方都須領牌有助大幅提升對乘客的出行保障，但考慮到可能仍有少數不法分子以私家車非法取酬載客，我們會加強針對「白牌車」的罰則，訂明被定罪的司機須被停牌至少12個月，並可長達三年，以往法例沒有訂明，今次我們藉《條例草案》訂明清楚，希望加強阻嚇力。另外，我們亦建議強化暫時吊銷相關車輛牌照及扣押車輛的安排，就算未能識別涉事司機以作出刑事檢控，仍有機制可扣押涉案車輛。這涉及細化程序，我們正努力敲定細節，積極進行法律草擬，計劃將有關修訂納入《條例草案》。

主席，政府引入規管網約車制度的願景，是達致的士、網約車、市民多方共贏。正如我在不同場合多次強調，的士與網約車絕對不是零和博弈，兩者各有優勢，可以共存互補。的士獨特和固有的優勢不會因規範化網約車服務而改變；網約車亦可透過共享經濟的模式釋放閒置運力，為市民提供更多元化的選擇。我們的目標和希望是透過《條例草案》邁出引入規管制度的重要一步。我的團隊會全力配合法案委員會的審議工作，並盡力解答各議員的提問，一些提問與《條例草案》的草擬有關、一些與日後的執行細節有關，我們都非常重視，會一一細心聆聽，以爭取在立法會會期完結前通過今日討論的《條例草案》。

多謝主席。"

九月份第二批涵蓋12個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及六個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年九月共兩批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共32個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年八月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這32個監察區中，26個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有六區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

  Among the second batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 12 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering six survey areas in September, all were below 10 per cent.

  The FEHD has so far released two batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in September 2025, covering 32 survey areas. Among these 32 survey areas, 26 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. August 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Six other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

  Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


  Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

  âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

Consul General Gareth Williams (Consul-General of Australia to Hong Kong and Macao), Professor Dale Pinto (President and Chair of the Board, CPA Australia), Karina (2025 Divisional President of CPA Australia, Ms Karina Wong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to join you today to celebrate the 70th anniversary of CPA Australia in Hong Kong. CPA Australia is one of the world’s leading accounting bodies and has long been committed to supporting the sustainable development of the profession in the Asia-Pacific region. On this momentous occasion, may I extend my warmest congratulations to you all.

  This anniversary forum provides a timely opportunity to reflect on what we are facing, where we stand and how to chart the way forward.

  Indeed, the world today is marked by heightened uncertainty and challenges - driven by geopolitical tensions, rising protectionism, and serious humanitarian crises arising from prolonged regional conflicts.

  Yet, against this disappointing context, we see hope. There is renewed momentum for regional co-operation, evident in the growth of intra-regional trade and endeavours to expand regional trade agreements such as RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) and CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership). Efforts are also being made to strengthen multilateral organisations such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Notably, these initiatives are not about creating isolated blocs, but about building more resilient, forward-looking partnerships.

  At the same time, the global drive to combat climate change and further the sustainability cause remains strong. While some advanced economies have retracted from their climate commitments, the broader international community continues to push forward the green and sustainable agenda.

  Then comes artificial intelligence (AI), which is rapidly transforming the global economy. It is reinventing business models, redefining productivity and revolutionising how we work, communicate and live. From automating industrial production to accelerating drug discovery, and from optimising energy use to enhancing education, AI is vividly displaying its vast potential. Its pace of development has far exceeded expectations. While the US is focusing on large-scale models, massive investments and cutting-edge frontier research, Chinese open-source alternatives - such as DeepSeek - are charting a different course, prioritising cost efficiency, inclusiveness and real-world applications.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the world is fast changing. So how should Hong Kong respond? How should we position ourselves? And what does the future hold for our accounting professionals?

  In my view, these shifts have made Hong Kong more relevant than ever. Amid rising global volatility, international and Mainland investors are rediscovering Hong Kong’s value and unique function. Our financial markets, for example, have become a safe haven for international capital. The Hang Seng index rose by 18 per cent last year, and has increased by another 30 per cent so far in 2025. In the first eight months of this year, we raised US$16 billion through IPOs (initial public offerings) - ranking first globally. Bank deposits have grown nearly 8 per cent, reaching US$2.4 trillion. If you look at the sources of capital behind the rally of our stock market since September last year, around half of them come from Southbound investors from the Mainland, and the other half from international investors, primarily those from the US and Europe. This is evidence of renewed confidence in Hong Kong, reflecting our unique advantages under the “one country, two systems” framework.

  As China continues to advance in technology and innovation, and promotes high-level two-way opening up, more and more Mainland enterprises are using Hong Kong as a launch pad for international expansion and supply chain management - leveraging our deep capital markets, world-class professional services, talent and global networks. CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited), the world’s largest IPO of the year so far, is a good example. It uses 90 per cent of the funds raised in Hong Kong to build new plants in Hungary.

  Meanwhile, the rise of the Global South also presents tremendous opportunities. Many of these economies need capital for delivering infrastructure and sustainable development. They are also seeking to diversify their markets and even the currencies used in trade and foreign exchange reserve. Hong Kong’s role as a fundraising hub and an offshore Renminbi centre, with a currency pegged to the US dollar, is becoming increasingly important in meeting their needs.

  As a regional leader in green finance and green technology, we not only mobilise capital for sustainable projects but also actively contribute to the development of international standards on green classification, reporting and disclosure. These standards provide the basis to guide capital flows toward credible climate initiatives and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

  Looking ahead, Hong Kong is doubling down on innovation and technology. Together with sister cities in the Greater Bay Area, we are building a world-class I&T (innovation and technology) ecosystem. Two weeks ago, the World Intellectual Property Organization released this year’s innovation cluster ranking, and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster tops the world.

  In this connection, Hong Kong is actively attracting strategic enterprises engaged in cutting-edge technologies. So far, we have welcomed over 80 such enterprises, with more than HK$50 billion in planned investments and the creation of 20 000 quality jobs. A new batch of such enterprises will be announced soon, including several world-leading pharmaceutical firms. We are equally committed to attracting talent. From the end of 2022 till August this year, we received some 530 000 applications under various talent admission schemes, with more than 350 000 approvals and 230 000 individuals having arrived in Hong Kong.

  These exciting developments present a new era of opportunity for the accounting profession. In a world of an evolving trade landscape and deepening regional integration, there is a growing demand for professionals who can navigate cross-border finance, taxation and regulatory compliance. The green transition requires auditors and advisors to assess ESG (environmental, social and governance) risks, verify sustainability disclosures, and help businesses align with international standards. In the digital economy, accountants are valued for their skills in data analytics, cybersecurity and the valuation of intangible assets.

  For that, I trust CPA Australia and its members will continue to play a vital role in shaping the next chapter for Hong Kong and the accounting profession. We look forward to working with you to build an even better business environment, a better Hong Kong, and a better future for all.

  Thank you, and once again, congratulations on your 70th anniversary."
Speech by FS at CPA Australia Executive Forum (English only) (with photos),2025-09-16 16:52,2025-09-16 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600566.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the CPA Australia Executive Forum today (September 16):

Consul General Gareth Williams (Consul-General of Australia to Hong Kong and Macao), Professor Dale Pinto (President and Chair of the Board, CPA Australia), Karina (2025 Divisional President of CPA Australia, Ms Karina Wong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to join you today to celebrate the 70th anniversary of CPA Australia in Hong Kong. CPA Australia is one of the world’s leading accounting bodies and has long been committed to supporting the sustainable development of the profession in the Asia-Pacific region. On this momentous occasion, may I extend my warmest congratulations to you all.

  This anniversary forum provides a timely opportunity to reflect on what we are facing, where we stand and how to chart the way forward.

  Indeed, the world today is marked by heightened uncertainty and challenges - driven by geopolitical tensions, rising protectionism, and serious humanitarian crises arising from prolonged regional conflicts.

  Yet, against this disappointing context, we see hope. There is renewed momentum for regional co-operation, evident in the growth of intra-regional trade and endeavours to expand regional trade agreements such as RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) and CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership). Efforts are also being made to strengthen multilateral organisations such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Notably, these initiatives are not about creating isolated blocs, but about building more resilient, forward-looking partnerships.

  At the same time, the global drive to combat climate change and further the sustainability cause remains strong. While some advanced economies have retracted from their climate commitments, the broader international community continues to push forward the green and sustainable agenda.

  Then comes artificial intelligence (AI), which is rapidly transforming the global economy. It is reinventing business models, redefining productivity and revolutionising how we work, communicate and live. From automating industrial production to accelerating drug discovery, and from optimising energy use to enhancing education, AI is vividly displaying its vast potential. Its pace of development has far exceeded expectations. While the US is focusing on large-scale models, massive investments and cutting-edge frontier research, Chinese open-source alternatives - such as DeepSeek - are charting a different course, prioritising cost efficiency, inclusiveness and real-world applications.
  Ladies and gentlemen, the world is fast changing. So how should Hong Kong respond? How should we position ourselves? And what does the future hold for our accounting professionals?

Unemployment and underemployment statistics for June - August 2025,2025-09-16 16:30,2025-09-16 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600322.htm,"  According to the latest labour force statistics (i.e. provisional figures for June - August 2025) released today (September 16) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 3.7% in June - August 2025, same as that in May - July 2025. The underemployment rate increased from 1.4% in May - July 2025 to 1.6% in June - August 2025.

  Comparing June - August 2025 with May - July 2025, movements in the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) in different industry sectors varied. Increases were mainly seen in the food and beverage service activities sector and manufacturing sector while decreases were mainly seen in the construction sector and professional and business services sector (excluding cleaning and similar activities). As to the underemployment rate, increases were mainly seen in the food and beverage service activities sector; and arts, entertainment and recreation sector while a decrease was mainly seen in the decoration, repair and maintenance for buildings sector.

  Total employment increased by around 9 300 from 3 671 300 in May - July 2025 to 3 680 600 in June - August 2025. Over the same period, the labour force also increased by around 15 400 from 3 816 200 to 3 831 600.

Commentary

  Commenting on the latest unemployment figures, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, said, ""The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed the same at 3.7% in June - August 2025 as that in the preceding three-month period. The labour force and total employment increased further to 3 831 600 and 3 680 600 respectively.""

  Looking ahead, Mr Chris Sun said, ""While the business situations of certain sectors will continue to weigh on employment, steady growth of the Hong Kong economy as well as the Government's various measures to boost economic momentum and bolster consumption would provide support to the overall labour demand.""

Further information

  The unemployment and underemployment statistics were compiled from the findings of the continuous General Household Survey.

  In the survey, the definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment follow closely those recommended by the International Labour Organization. The employed population covers all employers, self-employed persons, employees (including full-time, part-time, casual workers, etc.) and unpaid family workers. Unemployed persons by industry (or occupation) are classified according to their previous industry (or occupation).

  The survey for June - August 2025 covered a sample of some 26 000 households or 68 000 persons, selected in accordance with a scientifically designed sampling scheme to represent the population of Hong Kong. Labour force statistics compiled from this sample represented the situation in the moving three-month period of June to August 2025.

  Data on labour force characteristics were obtained from the survey by interviewing each member aged 15 or over in the sampled households.

  Statistical tables on the latest labour force statistics can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode200.html). More detailed analysis of the labour force characteristics is given in the ""Quarterly Report on General Household Survey"" which is published four times a year. The latest issue of the report contains statistics for the quarter April - June 2025 while the next issue covering the quarter July - September 2025 will be available by end November 2025. Users can also browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1050001&scode=200).

The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 30 square metres on the roof of a residential building at Tung Tau Wan Road, Stanley. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without the prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today, ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

創新科技及工業局局長出席立法會工商及創新科技事務委員會會議就研究及發展中心的年度進度報告的開場發言（只有中文）,2025-09-16 15:40,2025-09-16 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600497.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（九月十六日）出席立法會工商及創新科技事務委員會會議就研究及發展中心的年度進度報告的開場發言：

主席、各位議員：

創新科技是香港高質量發展的核心動力。創新科技署轄下的研發中心通過行業主導和切合市場需求的應用研發工作和技術轉移，為業界和整體社會的發展帶來顯著效益。

回顧二○二四至二五年度，外圍環境依然複雜多變。不同的企業和機構皆面對地緣政局和貿易摩擦的挑戰。儘管如此，研發中心在市場上獲得的收入仍有上升。他們在這個年度獲得來自業界及其他收入約為3億9,100萬元，商品化及其他收入則約為1億9,510萬元，較上一個年度分別增加百分之29和百分之23。

在二○二四至二五年度，研發中心共開展156個新研發項目，涉及的項目總成本約為8億7,100萬元。截至今年三月，研發中心共有433個進行中的項目，其中254個項目涉及業界參與，公司數量達到473間。各數字都較上一個年度為高。

我相信各位議員在過去一年參加的各類型創科活動，都能見證這些中心的研發成果有效幫助本地企業和公營機構進行科技升級轉型，增強競爭力。科研成果落地讓更多創新科技融入生活，也能提升社會大眾的生活質素。

具體而言，我舉幾個例子。香港應用科技研究院與博愛醫院董事局將合力研究為二○二七年落成的「博愛醫院屯門藍地長者護理及護養安老院舍項目」引入多元化創新應用科技，打造全港最大型的智能院舍；物流及供應鏈多元技術研發中心為運輸及物流局開發港口社區系統，提供一站式全天候實時追蹤運輸資訊的數據智能基礎設施及跨企業軟件平台，提升香港的航運競爭力；以及納米及先進材料研發院與房屋局合作，研發新一代牆體連接技術，提升建設公營房屋的效率和質量。

值得一提的是，研發中心在二○二五年全球創科權威的「愛迪生獎」中榮獲多個金獎和銀獎，是國際社會對香港研發工作的高度肯定。

展望未來，因應科技的發展以及配合《香港創新科技發展藍圖》的發展策略，我們會圍繞國家和香港重點發展的前沿科技領域，重塑香港公營科研機構的整體布局。除了成立微電子研發院，我們也正籌建生命健康研發院及香港人工智能研發院。

同時，我們已經將汽車科技研發中心併入香港生產力促進局，以及將自二○二六年四月起合併香港應用科技研究院和納米及先進材料研發院，產生協同效益。

政府也期望香港紡織及成衣研發中心和物流及供應鏈多元技術研發中心逐步轉型，發展成為由業界主力支持的研發中心。自二○二八年四月一日起，政府將繼續支持這兩所中心透過現行安排開展研發項目，但不再資助兩所中心的營運開支。政府一直與兩所中心緊密溝通，協助他們制定達致自負盈虧的計劃。

我們將繼續支持各研發中心進行以行業為主的應用研發工作，共同為建設香港國際創科中心貢獻力量。

最後我們準備了一部短片，更具體介紹各研發中心過去一年的研發及商品化成果。隨後，政府團隊和中心的代表會回應各位委員的提問。謝謝。"
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-09-16 15:40,2025-09-16 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600504.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on September 15 to noon today (September 16), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 162 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 165 584 samples of food imported from Japan (including 108 312 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 37 454 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

Speech by SITI at Seminar on New Space Economy - Breakthroughs and Opportunities organised by Maritime Silk Road Society (English only) (with photo),2025-09-16 15:28,2025-09-16 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/16/P2025091600480.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, at the Seminar on the New Space Economy - Breakthroughs and Opportunities organised by the Maritime Silk Road Society today (September 16):

The Honourable Mrs Regina Ip (Co-Chair of the Maritime Silk Road Society), the Honourable Mr Bernard Chan (Co-Chair of the Maritime Silk Road, Honorary Sponsor), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to join you today at the Seminar on the New Space Economy, where we gather to discuss the breakthroughs and explore the opportunities on this front.

  In recent years, the Chinese space programme has made remarkable accomplishments. From the BeiDou satellite navigation system, the Chang'e lunar mission, the Tianwen Mars mission, to the Tiangong space station, these achievements fully demonstrate the country's determination to accelerate the construction of a strong aerospace nation.

  Last month, the country's new-generation manned launch vehicle, Long March-10 carrier rocket, has successfully completed its first static fire test. This marks a significant new milestone in China's manned lunar exploration programme, and is also a testament to the national engineering prowess.

  To align with the national development direction, we are committed to leveraging our strengths to contribute to the country's needs. Hong Kong is home to five universities ranked among the world's top 100, and we have numerous internationally renowned research scholars, showcasing our robust foundation in basic research. We have consistently supported local universities and research institutions in playing to their strengths in basic research, including conducting aerospace-related studies and striving to participate in national aerospace and other technological projects.

  We are delighted to see that research teams from local universities have been involved in multiple national aerospace missions, such as providing systems, instruments, and technical support for lunar and Mars missions, as well as sending research projects into national spacecraft for experiments, contributing to the country's aerospace development. A Hong Kong citizen has also been selected as a preparatory astronaut, specifically a payload specialist, under the National Manned Space Programme for the first time. Being able to participate in national aerospace projects is an immense honour for us, and it is truly encouraging for the innovation and technology (I&T) talents in Hong Kong, particularly the aerospace research community.

  In addition to leveraging our research strengths, we are also dedicated to fostering global research collaboration. The Government has established the Hong Kong Space Robotics and Energy Centre (the Centre) under the InnoHK research clusters to participate in the Chang'e-8 mission, contributing to national aerospace development. The Centre, in collaboration with Mainland and overseas institutions, including the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology and South African National Space Agency, will complete an international collaboration project appointed by the China National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center and develop a multifunctional lunar surface operation robot with precise operation and wireless charging capability, which will carry out tasks such as scientific exploration, instrument deployment and installation under extreme lunar environments.

  The Government will continue to invest in the development of I&T, including aerospace technology, with a view to developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre and contributing to the country's development into a nation with strong science and technology.

  Thank you, and I hope each of you will find the seminar and discussions ahead insightful. Thank you."
