Investigation revealed that the arrested man was suspected of disclosing details of a case endangering national security, after assisting with the investigation conducted earlier by NSD officers. He was also suspected of publishing multiple videos with seditious intention online, with content provoking hatred towards the Central Authorities, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Judiciary.

The man is being detained for further enquiries.

Police took law enforcement actions based on evidence and in accordance with the actual circumstances, and applied Section 88 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance for the first time. The article stipulated that if a person knows or suspects that an investigation of an offence endangering national security is being conducted, the person with intent to prejudice the investigation; or being reckless as to whether the investigation will be prejudiced, without reasonable excuse or lawful authority, makes any disclosure; or the person knowing or suspecting that any material is likely to be relevant to the investigation; and with intent to conceal the facts disclosed by the material from persons conducting the investigation, without reasonable excuse, falsifies, conceals, destroys or otherwise disposes of the material, or causes or permits the material to be falsified, concealed, destroyed or otherwise disposed of, commits an offence. Offenders shall be liable to imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Police remind members of the public that ""doing an act that has a seditious intention with a seditious intention"" is also a serious offence. Offenders shall be liable to imprisonment for seven years on first conviction.

  In addition, the Government has so far disbursed an emergency subsidy of $10,000 to 1 931 households.

  Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 970 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

  As of this morning, a total of 1 403 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 2 599 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Moreover, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

  The Transport Department (TD) is steering public transport operators (PTOs) to enhance services of franchised buses, green minibuses and residents' services (RS) by deploying additional vehicles and manpower to support residents affected by the fire who have been admitted into transitional housing in various districts, facilitating transfers to other services to and from different districts. Among them, an additional shuttle bus service has been launched connecting Good House in Tai Po, Tai Po Centre and Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, while a supplementary RS has been introduced connecting THE STEP (a transitional housing project) in Yuen Long and Tai Po Market Station. The TD will closely co-ordinate with operating organisations of transitional housing projects concerned and PTOs to cater for residents' commuting needs.

Relief supplies and donations
--------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 500 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, Government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 4 800 pieces of donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Handling of reported missing persons
------------------------------------------

  The Police have completed searches inside all seven buildings. Officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit continued to search the area around the buildings and near the collapsed scaffolding today, which had been confirmed as safe. No human remains were found, and the number of the deceased remains at 159. The Police are contacting the families of the missing persons and those who have preliminarily identified the deceased through photographs and are arranging for them to undergo DNA oral swab sampling early next week for scientific identification of the deceased.

Investigations
----------------

  The Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force, led by the Fire Services Department, collected samples at the fire scene together with personnel of the Government Laboratory for testing.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

  The Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau continued to extract concrete core samples from the affected buildings today. So far, four buildings have been covered.

  All the protective nets in the four Home Ownership Scheme courts, including Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme, have been removed.

  The Development Bureau announced on December 3 that any scaffold nets installed on external walls of all public and private buildings, as well as government buildings undergoing major repair work, must be removed by today, and the work on the external walls must temporarily cease. Discretionary arrangements for an extension of time may be considered for individual cases if there are reasonable grounds. As of 3pm today, of the some 200 private buildings installed with scaffold nets, 175 have had their scaffold nets removed from the external walls. The removal work at another 52 private buildings is underway and expected to be completed in one to two days. Three applications requesting additional time involving three buildings were received, and the relevant contractors indicated that they will aim to finish the removal work by next week. Having reviewed the justifications provided, the Buildings Department (BD) has accepted their applications.

  The BD has sent today SMS messages to all registered contractors (including those currently carrying out major repair work or those who have earlier received a cease-work order issued by the BD) and reminded them again that before and after the removal of protective nets, screens, tarpaulins and plastic sheeting from scaffolding (except for localised areas requiring emergency protection), they must ensure that there are no materials or loose items on the scaffolding, and that the scaffolding is safely secured to ensure public safety.

  The BD is now pressing ahead with the formulation of a new set of arrangements requiring the scaffold nets used at construction sites to be sampled on-site and certified as compliant with the relevant standards prior to installation. The BD aims to make an announcement within the next week so that the relevant external wall work can resume as soon as possible.

  In view of the suspension of repair work on external walls of those buildings, after joint deliberation by the Construction Industry Council (CIC) and the Development Bureau, the CIC will expand the quota of the current Multi-skilled/Skill Enhancement courses, which are tuition-free and with subsidies, and reserve 5 000 training places for affected workers (trades including plumbing, window framing, painting and decoration, plastering, and bamboo scaffolding). The measure will not only help them upgrade their skills, but also alleviate the impact of the work suspension on them. Depending on the specific trade course and training hours, workers who complete the training and obtain qualifications can receive a maximum subsidy of $14,000 to $19,000. Applications for the programme will open Monday (December 8).

  The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 318 construction sites, issued a total of 163 written warnings and 95 improvement notices, and has taken out 25 prosecutions."

調查工作
————

由消防處牽頭的跨部門調查專組聯同政府化驗所人員，在火災現場檢取樣本進行化驗。

規管巡查
————

房屋局獨立審查組今日繼續抽取受災樓宇的混凝土芯，目前已包括四座樓宇。

所有四個居屋屋苑（深水埗怡閣苑、觀塘安基苑、沙田穗禾苑、深水埗清麗苑）和一個租置屋邨（柴灣峰華邨）的棚網已全部完成拆除。

發展局於十二月三日公布，所有正進行大維修而外牆設有棚網的公營、私人樓宇和政府大樓須於今日將棚網下架並暫時停止外牆工程，如有合理理由，個別個案可酌情給予較長時間。就200多幢外牆設有棚網的私人樓宇，截至今日下午三時，175幢私人樓宇的外牆棚網已經移除，另有52幢的移除工程正在進行中，預計可於一至兩日內完成。要求額外時間處理的申請有三宗，涉及三幢樓宇，相關承建商表示會爭取於下星期完成所需棚網移除工程，屋宇署經審視有關理據後，接受其延期申請。

屋宇署今日向所有註冊承建商（包括正進行大維修工程及早前接獲署方停工命令的承建商）發出短訊，再次提醒他們在移除棚架上的保護網、保護幕、防水油布及塑膠帆布（需緊急維護的局部位置除外）之前及之後，必須確保棚架上無任何物料或鬆脫物，以及棚架安全穩固，以確保公眾安全。

屋宇署正密鑼緊鼓制定一套新的安排，要求工地使用的棚網在上架前就地採樣及核實是否符合標準，爭取下星期內公布，以便有關外牆工程可盡早恢復。

因應該等樓宇維修的外牆工程暫停，建造業議會與發展局共同探討後，將擴大現時「免學費、有津貼」的「一專多能／技術提升」課程學額，並預留5 000個培訓名額予受影響工人（工種包括水喉、窗框、髹漆及裝飾工、泥水，以及竹棚架）報讀，既有助他們提升技能，亦減低停工對他們的影響。按不同工種的培訓課程及時數，工人完成訓練並考取資格，可獲最多14,000元至19,000元津貼不等。有關計劃下星期一（十二月八日）開始接受報名。

勞工處繼續巡查設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工程工地的防火設施及火災應變安排，以保障工人的職業安全。截至今日下午四時，勞工處已巡查318個建築地盤，共發出163份書面警告及95張敦促改善通知書，並提出25宗檢控。"
CHP recorded another locally acquired case of chikungunya fever,2025-12-06 20:05,2025-12-06 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/06/P2025120600629.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 6), the CHP has recorded one new local case of chikungunya fever (CF). The CHP is collaborating with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) to implement appropriate prevention and control measures to minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest case information
------------------------------

  The case involves a 67-year-old female living in Kwai Tsing District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she developed joint pain and a fever on December 2 and 3 respectively, followed by rash yesterday (December 5) and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital on the same day. She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

  The preliminary investigation also revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. The case is classified as local. She hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails with a household contact on November 29. Other than that, the CHP found no overlap between her activities during the incubation period and the locations visited by earlier confirmed cases. The CHP considered that the patient likely contracted the infection while hiking near Tsing Yi Nature Trails on that day, and that there is an epidemiological linkage between this case and the recent local cases in Tsing Yi. Her household contacts (including the hiking companion) are currently asymptomatic. The CHP has implemented prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to the household contacts concerned. If necessary, the CHP will arrange for laboratory testing. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 78 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 10 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------------

As some confirmed CF cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. The CHP continued to urge individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which was set up earlier. The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. In late November, the CHP also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department and Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Meanwhile, regarding the recently announced local case involving a23-year-old female living in Sheung Wan, the epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The CHP continued to urge the members of the public residing and working at Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. CHP officers continued to reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind individuals to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 2 700 individuals residing or working in the district through the health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre, its enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past one day. Two individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests. One of them tested negative for the chikungunya virus, and the result for the other individual is pending. Given the significant decrease in the number of citizens visiting the health consultation booth recently, the operating hours of the booth will be adjusted starting tomorrow (December 7) based on actual needs. Please refer to the CHP's webpage for the actual operating hours of the health consultation booth.

Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生防護中心再錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案,2025-12-06 19:45,2025-12-06 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/06/P2025120600571.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月六日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱本地個案。中心正聯同食物環境衞生署（食環署）採取適當防控措施，以減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名67歲女子，住所位於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於十二月二日及三日分別出現關節痛及發燒，昨日（十二月五日）出現皮疹，同日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

初步調查顯示，病人在潛伏期內不曾外遊，屬本地感染個案。她曾於十一月二十九日與一名家居接觸者到青衣自然徑行山。除此以外，中心未發現她在潛伏期內的其他活動地點與早前確診個案曾到訪的地點有重疊。中心認為，病人較大機會於當日在青衣自然徑一帶行山時受到感染，與近期青衣的本地個案有流行病學關連。她的家居接觸者（包括一名一同行山人士），暫時沒有出現病徵。中心已按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為相關家居接觸者提供醫學監察及健康建議。如有需要，中心會安排化驗檢測。流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

本港今年累計錄得78宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，10宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

鑑於近期部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。中心繼續呼籲近期曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。熱線會繼續由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心在上月底亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

另外，就日前公布的一宗本地個案（涉及一名居於上環的23歲女子），流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

中心繼續呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會繼續接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於上環文娛中心正門入口處設立醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於上述受影響地區進行上門探訪，為逾2 700名在當區工作或居住的市民進行評估，而過去一日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為兩名早前出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，其中一人的樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性，另一人的樣本正等候結果。鑑於近日前往醫護站的市民明顯減少，明日（十二月七日）起，醫護站的運作時間會因應實際需要而調整，確實時間請參閱中心網站。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

​
​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；

在此房屋局希望再次澄清一些誤解，就是一直有媒體報道提及受大火影響的災民在入住過渡性房屋後，只有數個月的免租期，然後便需繳付租金。房屋局發言人指出，有關言論並非事實。

發言人重申，考慮到受火災影響居民非常緊急的情況，房屋局早已作出特別安排，對入住過渡性房屋或其他上述項目的受影響居民提供住宿援助，租金全免。換句話說，如有需要，受影響的居民可以較長期入住。政府會在住宿方面一直支援受影響居民，有需要的居民無需擔心相關租金開支或居住期。

受火災影響的市民如欲入住房屋局的過渡性房屋，可致電3611 8482查詢；如欲入住房協的專用安置屋邨、暫租住屋項目或出租屋邨空置單位，可致電2839 1393查詢；如市民就房屋署的中轉屋或臨時收容中心有任何查詢，則可致電2658 4430。"

The interim housing and transit centres of the HD are also being actively prepared.

  The Housing Bureau would like to clarify some misunderstandings once again. Media reports have consistently stated that victims affected by the fire incident only have a few months of rent-free period after moving into transitional housing before they are required to pay rent. The spokesman of the Housing Bureau pointed out that such statements are false.

  The spokesman reiterates that, in consideration of the extremely emergency situation of the residents affected by the fire incident, special arrangements have already been made earlier by the Housing Bureau to provide accommodation support to those affected residents moving into transitional housing or other above-mentioned projects. The affected residents may stay with full rent exemptions. In other words, if needed, the affected residents can stay for a longer period of time. The Government will continue to support the affected residents in terms of accommodation, and the residents in need do not have to worry about the relevant rental expenses or the duration of their stay.

  Affected residents who would like to stay in the transitional housing under the Housing Bureau may call 3611 8482. Affected residents who would like to stay in the units in dedicated rehousing estates flats, ""T-Home"" projects and rental estates under the HKHS may call 2839 1393 for enquiries.

海關人員昨日（十二月五日）在香港國際機場截查一名三十二歲抵港男旅客，並在其個人行李內檢獲約一萬三千二百支未完稅香煙，估計市值約五萬九千元，應課稅值約四萬三千元。該名抵港旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Customs officers intercepted a 32-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (December 5). About 13,200 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $59,000 and a duty potential of about $43,000, were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

民政及青年事務局局長、勞工及福利局局長就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒答問內容,2025-12-06 12:03,2025-12-06 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/06/P2025120600278.htm,"民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十二月六日）上午出席電台節目後，就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的答問內容：

記者：首先想問局長現在仍有受災居民指沒有「一戶一社工」聯絡他們，亦有社工反映政府給的指示不是很清楚，他們都是看新聞才知道自己要做什麼，或者資訊如何安排，這方面你們如何跟社工溝通，有沒有做得不足的地方？

勞工及福利局局長：「一戶一社工」基本上社會福利署（社署）約2 000名社工其實是全體出動的，差不多社署每一位註冊社工都會協助一個家庭，大家都知道宏福苑應該有1 984戶，所以每戶都會有一個社工，「一戶一社工」、一社工一戶，是這樣做配對的。截至昨日（十二月五日）下午四時，已經有約1 900戶登記了，絶大多數社工已聯絡他們。現在的做法是每天社工最少會打兩個電話給他們，早上和下午各一個，現時接通率大概為八成五，住戶會接電話，有時候可能剛走開了未有接聽或當刻不想接電話，這不要緊，但我認為溝通是順暢了，陸續社工會作探訪，跟他們傾談，拿八達通卡給他們，可以通過這個方法讓大家可以更密切，認識更多、了解更清楚。

公務員方面，現時做法是一個社工會編配兩至三名公務員，因為這是公務員的動員，陸陸續續在起動。社工同事其實本身有專業的培訓，但在大火災發生的初期資訊很多，有些資訊是要通過內部發放途徑讓他們知道。有時居民問的東西林林總總，未必純粹是問政府資訊，每一個家庭面對的問題都不同，社工要想盡辦法，他們未必懂得所有資訊，我們的想法是當居民在徬徨之際，先打電話給社工，社工收到後再去想想這些問題應找那個部門、處所協助，我聽到的是，包括剛剛我有說到譬如婆婆要回到宏志閣，但她不能走動又剛做完手術，她想親友陪同，社工就幫她找警察，警方同意了讓兩名親友陪她。有些會打來問住的問題，譬如可否幫忙找一間酒店暫住，又或者有其他需要，社工都會盡量幫助轉介。

現時我掌握的是，截至現時「一戶一社工」基本上運行順暢，因為社工們已接觸和致電住戶，如果仍然有極少數住戶未登記，最理想就請他致電182 183，原本182 183是24小時有人接聽的照顧者專線，但是我們和東華三院談好了，182 183會處理大火災下受影響居民，如果打182 183留下其聯絡方法，我們已配對的社工會去聯絡，希望盡快所有住戶全數登記，現在只差很少而已，只有數十戶尚未登記。

記者：麥局長，想問問援助基金現在達到30億元，其實居民的需要是中長線住屋問題，假如他們可能不想搬到現時的中轉屋或過渡屋，想自己出去租住單位的話，這個基金有沒有甚麼限制？譬如可不可以申請用來交租？甚至將來有意願重建的話，又可不可以用這些基金的錢去幫他們做這些事？另外，棚網方面，因為知道你們和發展局推出了支援計劃，其實區議員現在接觸了多少法團？他們最主要的憂慮是甚麼？如果真的限期屆滿，即今日需要拆網，有沒有一些大廈可能處理不了這個問題？會怎樣寬容一點去處理這件事？

民政及青年事務局局長：支援基金（「大埔宏福苑援助基金」）方面，得到各界對宏福苑的關心，支援基金截至昨日下午，外界的捐款已籌得27億元，加上政府撥款的三億元起始基金，現時整個基金有30億元。30億元當中，過去幾天我們都推出了不同的支援計劃，包括應急錢（一萬元應急補助金）、生活津貼，還有給外傭、學生和工友等的補助金，處理不同群體在這個時候的特別需要。大家知道我們將生活津貼的金額由本來的五萬元，在十二月四日開始增加到十萬元。這是因為我們接觸了受影響住戶，了解到他們的需要，我們便會為不同群組推出計劃以符合他們的需要，包括剛才你提到的中期住屋需要，又或是日後長期的住屋方案。我們會在適當時候，按居民的需要和意願，推出不同計劃去解決。所以我們多次強調整個過程，當居民由火警發生到重建家園會是一個很長的過程，支援基金會為他們提供一些長期和持續的支援。政府也會陪伴各位受影響居民，走這段比較有挑戰的路。政府希望透過好好地運用支援基金，來解決居民中期或長期的住屋需要，或他們生活的需要。

至於棚網方面，昨日我們和發展局通知了大家，我們很明白，現時棚網要下架，也有一些法團正進行大維修工程，可能都牽涉到這次火災事故的顧問公司和工程公司。我們明白很多業主會很忐忑，究竟會不會因為這樣而令自己屋苑的大維修工程會「爛尾」、拖延或如何收拾？所以我們和發展局昨日宣布，會透過十八區的區議員接觸不同的法團，發展局也會聯絡和統整一些專業團體的力量，包括香港測量師學會和一些法定機構，由專業人士為法團提供專業支援。譬如如果他們真的要重新選擇一間顧問公司或工程公司，要重新招標，那程序是怎樣？應該怎樣去選擇？要求應該是怎樣？我們會向他們提供協助，而物監局（物業管理業監管局）亦已通知全港的物管公司，他們也要盡公司的責任，好好協助法團管理和處理這些工程。

記者：剛剛說到其實「一戶一社工」接觸率也很大，在節目中也提到未來每戶會配備兩至三個公務員「跑腿」，想知道現在計劃進程，大概何時會見到公務員開始投入服務？另外坊間有聲音說要全面落實所有地盤禁煙，現在進展怎樣、有沒有遇到困難或者目前計劃是怎樣的？最後想問問，剛才麥局長提到整個過程會很漫長，短期支援和長期支援大概會預留多少錢？始終現在30億都很多，有沒有說大概短期支援會花多少錢？後來的計劃又是怎樣？會預留多少百分比的資金供長期支援？

勞工及福利局局長：「一戶一社工」下同一時間每名社工每一戶都配對兩至三名公務員，這是公務員動員的其中一部分，陸續我們開始行動，「跑腿」是我說的其中一個比較通俗的說法，主要考慮到在宏福苑有很多老人家，譬如入住過渡屋可能比較遠，如他們有特別需要，同事可以幫他拿物資，甚至可以想像接下來除了政府的財政支援外，不少慈善團體表示會有財政支援，兩種形式都有，有些是金錢，可能老人家想拿支票或者需要幫忙，我們請同事送上去，就不用老人家奔走。另外如果是實物，假設有這樣的支援，我們又可以送過去，這是想像中可能出現的情況，但實則上在支援過程中應該有出現很多情景需要別人幫忙，我覺得同事很樂意的，可以減輕他們的壓力，這些我們會做好的。

地盤禁煙方面，現行的法例下，勞工處處長如發現有易燃的物體，或者有懷疑而找到證據的，認為該處有火災風險，處長可針對每一個地盤逐個禁煙，這個做法是逐個地盤去做的，而且處長是需要證明該處是有火災風險的。

但現時我聽到較強烈的呼聲，指是否應該要有全面的要求把所有地盤皆定為禁煙區，這個做法和現有的法例寫法完全不同，但我聽得很清晰社會上有很強的呼聲，所以當立法會在一月一日正式運作後，我們第一時間會跟立法會商討，如果立法會議員認同社會上這種呼聲我們就去修例，但在還未修例之前，處長沒有權說所有地盤都要禁煙，現時只可以逐個去看。現在我們已在進行，是逐個地盤看，一有風險就要禁煙。所以如果這個呼聲這麼強烈的話，我們跟立法會商討後若大家都認為要這樣做，我們就修例。

民政及青年事務局局長：正如我們剛才多次強調，政府會陪伴所有受影響住戶走這段路程，讓他們可以逐步恢復正常生活，重建家園。而支援基金的款項亦會按居民在不同時期的需要，包括現在一定是短期的迫切需要，解決他們燃眉之急，中期的時候，包括他們的住屋需要和生活需要。然後到長期，大家會想怎樣可以重建家園？這亦是我們在整個過程聽到居民的需要和意願，我們便會推出不同計劃，好好善用這支援基金，令到居民短、中、長期的需要，無論是生活需要或是住宿需要都會得到照顧。

Remarks by SHYA and SLW at media session regarding follow-up work on fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po,2025-12-06 11:57,2025-12-06 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/06/P2025120600268.htm,"âThe Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, and the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media today (December 6) regarding the follow-up work on the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, after attending a radio programme. Following are their remarks at the media session:

Reporter: Miss Mak, right now the funds are being used for immediate relief. How does the Government plan to ensure that funds allocated for the fire victims are used effectively in the long term to help them rebuild their lives? Are there any specific schemes or initiatives being developed to assist affected families? And how will the funds be allocated toward long-term housing solutions? And in terms of scaffold netting, how will the authorities help those who are unable to meet the deadline by today? Mr Sun, what specific penalties do you foresee for companies or workers who violate the proposed smoking ban that comes into effect?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: For the Support Fund (""Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po""), right now we have already raised a total of $3 billion from the private sector and also from the Government's allocation fund. We hope we will make the best use of this Support Fund to help our residents being affected in this fire incident. As you know, we have already launched several relief funds to cater for their short-term needs. We will also make the best use of the Support Fund to provide long-term and sustainable support and assistance to those residents to help them rebuild their homes and let their lives resume normal.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. On the prohibition of smoking at construction sites, of course, it's subject to a discussion with the Legislative Council (LegCo) upon its establishment next year, on January 1. One of the issues we have to discuss is about if the consensus among the LegCo and the administration is to prohibit smoking at construction sites in general, we have to consider what kind of penalty we have to put in place.

One of the possible options we could explore is possibly a fixed ticket, so this is one of the ideas we need to explore. But of course, the detailed proposal is to be hammered out after discussions with LegCo and also we're going to consult the trade to make sure that whatever new prohibition is going to be introduced, it is enforceable. Thank you.
