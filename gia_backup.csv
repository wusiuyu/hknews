Speech by FS at International Bio-Computing Innovation Summit 2025 (English only),2025-09-29 12:30,2025-09-29 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/29/P2025092900440.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the International Bio-Computing Innovation Summit 2025 today (September 29):

Liu Wei (Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of BioMap), Clara (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited (HKIC), Ms Clara Chan), distinguished speakers and guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  It is a pleasure to join you all today for the Second International Bio-Computing Innovation Summit. I'm delighted to see such a strong turnout of global scientists, industry leaders, investors and young innovators in Hong Kong. Your presence reflects the growing momentum and shared vision in shaping the future of bio-computing.

  Just over a year ago, we gathered here with a sense of anticipation and purpose. We discussed the transformative potential of AI in accelerating the development of life sciences and pharmaceuticals. We also witnessed the strategic collaboration between the Hong Kong Investment Corporation and BioMap, marked by the establishment of BioMap's InnoHub right here in Hong Kong.

  Fast forward one year, we find ourselves in a world evolving at an extraordinary pace - especially in the realm of AI innovation. Large language models such as DeepSeek are shocking the world. Embodied AI is breaking new ground, with dramatic breakthroughs in vision-language-action models and robot dynamics.

  In healthcare, the applications of AI are expanding at a remarkable scale. AI is now helping us predict molecular structures and accelerate drug discovery. It is enhancing diagnostic accuracy, enabling personalised medicine, and supporting the creation of human digital twins that revolutionise clinical trials. It is also empowering synthetic biology, opening up many new application frontiers, from biomaterials to agriculture.

  These exciting developments all point to the fact that AI can be a powerful force for good, helping people live longer, stay healthier and lead happier lives.

Hong Kong's vision

  Hong Kong is actively positioning itself at the forefront of AI and biotech development. We are making strategic and substantial investments in these fields, and forging closer partnerships among the Government, the industry, academia as well as the research and investment sectors.

  The HKIC plays a vital role in driving these investments. By investing and co-investing in projects, it is channelling capital into sectors that we aim to develop. Currently, among its portfolio of over 130 projects, a significant number are focused on AI and biotech. Notably, around 20 per cent of its invested capital are deployed in biotech initiatives.

  I’m pleased to see that the HKIC's collaboration with BioMap is already bearing fruit. Since its establishment last year, the InnoHub has commissioned a number of high-impact initiatives. Today, we will witness the launch of three new projects, developed in partnership with leading local universities and regional collaborators. These projects are pushing the boundaries of research excellence, empowering education and accelerating the commercialisation of research outcomes.

  Hong Kong is indeed brimming with collaboration opportunities in this space. Both of our medical schools rank among the world's top 25. Five of our universities rank in the global top 50 in AI and data science. Twenty-eight laboratories and centres in the InnoHK research cluster are in partnership with leading institutions worldwide. All these are home to world-class research teams and pioneering projects.

  Taking a broader perspective, Hong Kong has what it takes to shine in bio-computing. That includes a thriving innovation and technology ecosystem; access to capital, data and markets; supportive government policies, and world-class talent. In the interest of time, I'd like to highlight just two of these strengths: capital and government policies.

A vibrant capital market

  First, access to capital. Hong Kong offers a full range of financing options for companies at different stages of development to grow and scale. 

  Our stock market is an important pillar. Since listing reforms were implemented in 2018, over 75 biotech firms have listed in Hong Kong, raising over US$30 billion, making us the world’s second-largest biotech fundraising hub. This year, our stock market has been performing very well, with IPOs (initial public offerings) raising over US$17 billion in the first eight months, nearly seven times the amount raised during the same period last year. Notably, biotech companies accounted for around 20 per cent of these funds.

  Beyond public markets, Hong Kong boasts a vibrant private capital ecosystem. We are home to over 650 private equity and venture capital firms, managing US$230 billion in assets, second only to the Chinese Mainland in Asia.

Supportive government policies

  Second, supportive government policies. AI and biotech are among the strategic sectors prioritised by the Government. In the Policy Address as well as the Budget this year, we outlined a series of forward-looking initiatives to accelerate AI development - focusing on algorithms, computing power, data, capital and talent.

  To drive the biotech sector forward, we are working to establish a primary evaluation mechanism for drug approvals, aiming to position Hong Kong as an internationally recognised regulatory authority. We are also strengthening cross-boundary collaboration on drug development. For example, in the Hetao Innovation and Technology Park, Hong Kong and Shenzhen have established cross-boundary clinical trial institutions, enabling studies that meet the regulatory standards of both jurisdictions. These efforts will help Hong Kong emerge as a regional drug development hub because the time-to-market for innovative drugs to be developed here can be greatly shortened.

Enterprises and talent

  But for our vision to materialise, it ultimately comes down to people and the enterprises they build. That's why we are relentlessly attracting high-impact enterprises engaged in cutting-edge technologies to Hong Kong. In fact, many of the companies attracted through our Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises are leading players in AI and biotech. A new batch of strategic enterprises to be announced in a couple of weeks will include several world-class pharmaceutical leaders. I’m proud to say that our AI and biotech ecosystem is becoming more dynamic and globally connected.

  In a world that is increasingly complex, fast-changing and technologically fragmented, Hong Kong remains open: open to talent, and open to innovation and collaboration. We welcome scientists, innovators, entrepreneurs, researchers and students to join our growing ecosystem and co-create a future where technology advances the progress of humanity.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the convergence of AI and biotech will be one of the most powerful forces shaping the future of science, healthcare and innovation. Hong Kong is committed to being a leader in this journey, where we connect the brightest minds, the best resources and boundless opportunities across borders.

  On this note, I wish this Summit every success, and to all of you, good health and business in the time ahead."

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-29 12:22,2025-09-29 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/29/P2025092900436.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 29) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

文化體育及旅遊局局長出席立法會經濟發展事務委員會政策簡報會開場發言（只有中文）,2025-09-29 12:03,2025-09-29 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/29/P2025092900350.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（九月二十九日）出席立法會經濟發展事務委員會政策簡報會就《行政長官2025年施政報告》有關旅遊政策措施的開場發言：

多謝主席。

今日我會向經濟發展事務委員會簡介在二○二五年《施政報告》中旅遊方面的主要措施。

香港旅遊業今年取得亮眼佳績，截至八月底，訪港旅客達約3 320萬人次，比二○二四年同期大幅上升12%。其中內地旅客佔2550萬人次，非內地旅客錄得765萬人次，比去年分別錄得11%及16%的雙位數增長。這些數字反映《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》的各項策略漸漸開始取得成效。

今年《施政報告》旅遊的篇章，大家會看到，除了文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）外，其他政策局和部門亦有推出新政策措施，配合旅遊發展，貫徹落實香港「無處不旅遊」。

首先，《施政報告》提出發展遊艇經濟。去年，《施政報告》建議在香港仔、南丫島等地點興建遊艇泊位，這方面的工作，發展局在積極推進當中。今年《施政報告》更進一步提出優化遊艇產業配套，包括訪港遊艇入境流程。運輸及物流局和保安局是主力政策局，但文體旅局亦十分歡迎支持這項措施。粵港澳大灣區遊艇旅遊發展和合作有助推展香港高端的遊艇旅遊。

除了遊艇旅遊外，我們亦積極發展郵輪旅遊。我們會吸引更多郵輪調配到香港。預計今年郵輪訪港航次比去年增加兩成至188班。而啟德郵輪碼頭營運合約將於二○二八年到期，我們現正檢視合約條件及條款，於今年年底開展招標工作。

在開拓客源方面，香港積極發展穆斯林旅遊。過去一年，香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）加強推進「認證、教育和宣傳」，在業界的努力下初見成績。在「2025年全球穆斯林旅遊指數」的排名中，香港在非穆斯林旅遊目的地當中位列第三，同時獲選為最具潛力的穆斯林友善旅遊目的地。今年一月至八月，中東訪客為5萬4 000人次，比去年同期增長接近40%。中東旅客於二○二五年上半年的人均消費約$10,400，較整體旅客人均消費約$5,400高接近一倍。截至今年八月底，已完成認證的清真友善餐廳數目亦由二○二四年年初的約100間增加至超過190間。下一步，旅發局已推出資助餐廳申請清真認證計劃，由《施政報告》公布當日，即今年九月十七日，至二○二六年年底成功獲得清真認證的餐廳，認證費可獲半額資助，上限為$5,000。

在發展「盛事＋旅遊」 方面，我們會透過文化、體育、節慶、旅遊項目等盛事，吸引旅客。當中包括今年十月底由旅發局主辦的升級版「香港美酒佳餚巡禮」，以及香港迪士尼樂園因應20周年推出的一系列慶祝活動和園區設施的提升。我們亦會繼續帶領海洋公園，聯同旅發局推出更多大熊貓主題活動和產品，延續大熊貓熱潮。此外，適逢明年是馬年，香港賽馬會將策劃以馬為主題的一系列慶祝活動及表演，推廣賽馬旅遊。

去年《施政報告》公布成立的「發展旅遊熱點工作組」已於今年五月公布九個有特色的熱點項目。其中，我們會打造18區主題花木園區，以及推廣香港工業旅遊、舊城中環、九龍城、維園市集、開放舊油麻地警署等多個深度熱點旅遊項目。

我們亦會推廣紅色旅遊，包括與深圳合作的「中國文化名人大營救」路線，以歷史為主題，作為紅色體驗研學新路線，加深市民和旅客對香港抗戰歷史的認識。

另外，為進一步發展「生態＋旅遊」，相關政策局和部門，包括環境及生態局、發展局、漁農自然護理署及民政事務總署，都會在各自範疇推出新措施。

我們提倡「人人都是旅遊大使」。旅發局正與傳媒機構合作，推出「傑出服務獎勵計劃」，涵蓋與旅遊相關的多個行業，透過大眾傳媒表揚提供優質產品與服務的商戶及從業員，鼓勵各界及市民以熱情好客的態度接待訪港的旅客。

文體旅融合是我們局的政策方向。在文化方面，我們會推動西九文化區發展、支持本地文創產業多元發展，並且推廣文藝盛事，例如以香港作為區內唯一主辦城市的巴塞爾藝術展Art Basel等，吸引高端旅客到訪。

在體育方面，當前最重要的，必然是要辦好第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆殘特奧會。我們已與業界聯手推出不同旅遊產品，吸引喜歡觀看運動賽事的旅客。同時，我們會繼續發揮啟德體育園作為體育盛事和產業化重要載體的優勢，推動「體育＋盛事」發展。例如，我們已與LIV Golf達成長遠合作安排，將LIV Golf League賽事在二○二六年和二○二七年落戶香港。我相信這項活動可吸引更多海外高端客戶來港。

展望未來，我們會繼續推動文體旅協同發展，打造香港旅遊新面貌，為經濟注入新動力。

多謝主席。"

大家早上好！我很高興今天出席《習近平的文化情緣》和《習近平經濟思想系列講讀》兩個節目在香港的啟播儀式，以及「紫荊綻放煥新篇——中央廣播電視總台與香港各界深化合作儀式」。首先，我熱烈歡迎慎海雄台長再次率團來到香港，並恭賀今天的啟播儀式和合作儀式順利舉行！

文化是國家的靈魂所繫，是民族團結的同心圓，是時代發展的血與脈。節目《習近平的文化情緣》透過實地探訪河北正定、福建廈門、浙江杭州、甘肅敦煌等習近平主席工作或考察過的地方，立體呈現習主席治國理政理念的深厚文化根基，同時讓香港市民加深認識中華民族源遠流長、兼收並蓄的文化底蘊，了解國家在文明探源、文化遺產保護等方面的努力。

習主席提出，我們要堅持把發展立足點放在高質量發展上，完整準確全面貫徹新發展理念，加快構建新發展格局，進一步全面深化改革，擴大高水平對外開放，推動經濟持續回升向好，保持社會和諧穩定。

今年是國家「十四五」規劃的收官之年，也是「十五五」規劃的謀篇布局之年。這次啟播的《習近平經濟思想系列講讀》節目，闡釋習主席的經濟思想內涵，以及關於推動高質量發展、新質生產力等重要論述，帶領觀眾了解國家經濟發展的戰略思維、牢記全面推進強國建設、實現民族復興的偉大使命。

中央廣播電視總台廣播覆蓋全國，全面報道國家各方面的最新發展，搭建起內地和香港民心相通的連心橋。總台的精彩節目幫助香港觀眾進一步了解國家發展的堅實步伐，為香港更好融入國家發展大局提供堅實的思想裝備。

今天，我們還將見證總台與香港有關體育、文化、旅遊等方面深化合作，結合兩地的傳播力量，助力推廣首次由廣東、香港、澳門共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，以及關於大熊貓文化、歷史文化等的主題活動和巡展，攜手推動兩地合作綻放精彩魅力。

我在今月發表的《施政報告》中，為香港主動對接國家發展戰略、實現突破新局面作出策略部署。《施政報告》強調，我們會發揮香港內聯外通的優勢服務國家，善用香港「出海」平台作用，攜手服務和引領更多企業「走出去」開拓全球業務。

特區政府將繼續與中央廣播電視總台全力合作，把香港「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢與總台覆蓋海內外的強大傳播力對接起來，發揮好世界窗口作用，向世界說好中國故事、說好香港故事。

環保署公布淘汰歐盟四期柴油商業車輛特惠資助計劃申請期的延長安排,2025-09-29 11:00,2025-09-29 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/29/P2025092500486.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）今日（九月二十九日）公布，在淘汰歐盟四期柴油商業車輛特惠資助計劃下，於二○一○年及二○一一年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛，其申請資助的截止日期會分別延長一年。

為改善路邊空氣質素及進一步保障巿民健康，環保署於二○二○年推出特惠資助計劃，以期在二○二七年年底前分階段淘汰約四萬輛歐盟四期柴油商業車輛（包括柴油貨車、非專利巴士和小型巴士）。合資格車主須在計劃推行期內，將其歐盟四期柴油商業車輛交由計劃下的登記拆車商拆毀，並於有關限期前到運輸署取消車輛登記，以及在取消車輛登記後三個月內申請特惠資助。

考慮到目前運輸業界在經營上正面對的挑戰和困難，部分於二○一○年及二
○一一年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛車主或未能於申領特惠資助的截止日期（即分別為二○二五年十二月三十一日及二○二六年十二月三十一日）前申請特惠資助，故環保署作出延長安排。

在延長安排下，於二○一○年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛，其申請資助的截止日期會延至二○二六年十二月三十一日；於二○一一年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛，其申請資助的截止日期則會延至二○二七年十二月三十一日。

此外，根據《空氣污染管制（空氣污染物排放）（受管制車輛）規例》（第311X章）（《規例》），政府將分別於二○二五年十二月三十一日及二○二六年十二月三十一日後停止為二○一○年及二○一一年首次登記的歐盟四期柴油商業車輛發出／續發車輛牌照。在該日後需續領車輛牌照的相關車主，須按《規例》第6條向環保署申請豁免，以延後有關車輛的淘汰限期。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興通過視頻參與2025世界粵商大會。我首先熱烈恭賀本屆大會順利舉行！

今年是國家「十四五」規劃的收官之年，也是「十五五」規劃的謀篇布局之年。今年，習近平主席在民營企業座談會上發表重要講話，強調新時代、新征程民營經濟發展前景廣闊、大有可為，廣大民營企業和民營企業家大顯身手正當其時。

粵港澳大灣區建設是國家主席習近平親自謀劃、親自部署、親自推動的重大國家發展戰略，是引領國家高質量發展的重要引擎。大灣區人口超過8 700萬，去年經濟總量接近15萬億元人民幣。大灣區發展生機勃勃，機遇處處。

廣東是改革開放的排頭兵、先行地、實驗區，民營經濟和先進製造業發展蓬勃。粵商精神勇於創新，在海內外都建立了廣闊的商業網絡。廣東和香港山水相連、文化相通，大量港商在廣東經營企業。在推動國家發展的歷程中，在粵港商一直積極參與推動廣東的發展，拼搏向上，為廣東民營企業發展擔當重要角色，一同創造商業奇跡。

香港是廣東最大的外資來源地。去年，廣東省新設港資企業超過13000家，實際利用港商直接投資額，高達722億元人民幣，佔全省外商直接投資總額超過七成。港商投資的行業多元，已從製造業擴展到服務業。我鼓勵港商繼續把握好國家機遇，積極融入國家發展大局，深化國際交往，以香港所長，服務國家所需。

在中央的全力支持下，香港與各個大灣區城市優勢互補，共建一流灣區高質量發展。今年底由廣東、香港、澳門三地共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會），是大灣區標誌性的合作項目。本屆全運會和殘特奧會首次由粵港澳三地聯合承辦，體現粵港澳大灣區同心共進的凝聚力量，更彰顯國家對大灣區協同發展的堅定信心。

我在剛發表的第四份《施政報告》中，提出一系列深化改革的策略部署。其中，特區政府將制訂促進產業和投資的優惠政策包，吸引企業落戶香港。內地企業的戰略重心已轉向積極開拓新興市場，不再聚焦單一國家。政府會成立內地企業出海專班，主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台「出海」，為企業制訂多元方案。

香港將用好內聯外通的優勢，發揮好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色。我期待粵商、港商繼續變革求新、匯聚力量，在爭取更大發展空間的同時，積極貢獻大灣區的高質量發展。我們將與內地企業包括廣大粵商攜手共進，把海外資本「引進來」的同時，一同「走出去」開拓更多市場，對接環球買家，創造更廣大的商機。

  To improve roadside air quality and better safeguard public health, the EPD launched in 2020 an ex-gratia payment scheme to progressively phase out by the end of 2027 about 40 000 Euro IV diesel commercial vehicles (DCVs) including goods vehicles, non-franchised buses and light buses. Eligible vehicle owners should, during the implementation of the scheme, scrap their Euro IV DCVs through vehicle scrapping companies registered under the scheme. They should then go to the Transport Department to cancel the registration of their DCVs before the deadlines, and apply for the ex-gratia payment within three months after the cancellation of the vehicle's registration.

  Taking into account the challenges and difficulties the transportation industry is currently facing in its operations, some owners of Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2010 and 2011 might not be able to apply for the ex-gratia payment by the deadlines for application (i.e. December 31, 2025, and December 31, 2026, respectively), hence an extension arrangement has been made.

  Under the extension arrangement, the ex-gratia payment application deadline for Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2010 will be extended to December 31, 2026; and that for Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2011 to December 31, 2027.

  The EPD spokesman reminds the owners of Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2010 and 2011 that approval of the ex-gratia payment is still subject to the applicants meeting all other prevailing eligibility criteria and completing all necessary procedures under the ex-gratia payment scheme, and submitting the applications for the ex-gratia payment on or before the new deadlines that apply.

  Moreover, in accordance with the Air Pollution Control (Air Pollutant Emission)(Controlled Vehicles) Regulation (Cap. 311X), the Government will stop issuing/renewing vehicle licences to Euro IV DCVs first registered in 2010 and 2011 after December 31, 2025, and December 31, 2026, respectively. The vehicle owners concerned who need to apply for vehicle licence renewal after the deadlines shall apply to the EPD for exemption under Section 6 of the Regulation for extending the retirement deadlines.

  For details of the ex-gratia payment scheme and the above special arrangement, please refer to the EPD's website (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/air/prob_solutions/Phasing_out_euro_iv_comm_veh.html) or contact the EPD by calling 2651 1100 or by email to EU4dcv@epd.gov.hk."
Applications for Mainland University Study Subsidy Scheme to close on October 13,2025-09-29 11:00,2025-09-29 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/29/P2025092900234.htm,"The Education Bureau (EDB) today (September 29) reminded eligible Hong Kong students who are interested in applying for a subsidy under the Mainland University Study Subsidy Scheme (MUSSS) for the 2025/26 academic year to submit their applications via the MUSSS Electronic Application Platform (musss.edb.gov.hk) or send the completed application forms by post to the EDB on or before October 13.
  
A spokesman for the EDB said that it was envisaged that the MUSSS would benefit most Hong Kong students pursuing undergraduate studies on the Mainland with different financial needs.
  
Eligible students may apply for a means-tested subsidy (only for those students who have passed the means test) or a non-means-tested subsidy under the MUSSS. The subsidy under the MUSSS is granted on a yearly basis. The subsidised period covers the normal duration of the undergraduate programme pursued by the student concerned in the designated Mainland institution. Eligible applicants may only receive either a means-tested subsidy or a non-means-tested subsidy in the same academic year.
  
Details of the MUSSS are available on the EDB website (www.edb.gov.hk/musss). The EDB is expected to notify individual applicants of the application results in phases from the first quarter of 2026."

HKSARG strongly opposes US Department of State's 2025 Investment Climate Statements: Hong Kong,2025-09-28 22:18,2025-09-28 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800730.htm,"A spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government said today (September 28) that the United States (US) Department of State's 2025 Investment Climate Statements (the Report) contains various biased assertions regarding Hong Kong's business environment. In particular, the Report continues to maliciously smear and make unfounded and false accusations against the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO). For this, the HKSAR Government expresses strong discontent and firm opposition. The spokesman reiterated, ""The implementation of national security laws has restored a safe and stable environment in Hong Kong, not only safeguarding the rights and freedoms of the general public but also making Hong Kong a more attractive and secure destination for international capital and investment. Various data clearly demonstrate that Hong Kong's outstanding business environment remains highly appealing to enterprises and investors and capital from around the world. Our core advantages, along with the HKSAR Government's efforts in promoting economic and social development, are widely recognised by the international community. The biased and inaccurate claims made in the Report are groundless and pale in comparison to the facts.""

The spokesman continued, ""In fact, since the beginning of this year, the Hong Kong stock market has performed strongly, with the Hang Seng Index rising by around 30 per cent. Initial public offering fundraising has surged, placing Hong Kong first globally. Bank deposits have increased by around 8 per cent, reaching close to HK$19 trillion. The asset and wealth management industry saw assets under management grow by 13 per cent year-on-year to over HK$35 trillion in 2024. Hong Kong is on track to become the world's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre within the next few years. These figures demonstrate that international investors are casting their vote of confidence in Hong Kong with concrete actions.""

  ""Hong Kong continues to shine and rise in various international competitiveness rankings on economic freedom, finance, innovation and technology, education and talent. For instance, Hong Kong is recognised as the world's freest economy, one of the top three global financial centres, ranked third in global competitiveness, and, together with Shenzhen and Guangzhou, forms the world's leading innovation cluster.""

  ""According to the World Investment Report 2025 published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Hong Kong attracted US$126 billion in foreign direct investment in 2024, ranking third globally. As of last year, nearly 10 000 companies with overseas and Chinese Mainland parent companies had chosen Hong Kong as their base, marking a historic high. Among them, nearly 1 400 were from the US, registering a 9 per cent increase year-on-year. Since the end of 2022, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises has successfully brought in over 80 strategic enterprises to set up or expand their operations in Hong Kong, many of which are global leaders in cutting-edge technologies. In the first eight months of this year, Invest Hong Kong supported more than 440 enterprises in establishing or expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, representing a 14 per cent increase compared to the same period last year. Overseas and Chinese Mainland enterprises each accounted for about half of these projects. These all demonstrate that Hong Kong continues to be an ideal location for enterprises from around the world to set up and grow their businesses.""

The spokesman said, ""Under the 'one country, two systems' arrangement, the HKSAR continues to practise the common law and uphold the rule of law, and maintain a judiciary that exercises powers independently. Various surveys indicate that foreign businesses operating in Hong Kong generally express strong confidence in the city's rule of law. For example, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong's annual member survey published earlier this year showed that 83 per cent of US businesses based in Hong Kong were confident in Hong Kong's rule of law—an increase of 4 and 10 percentage points compared to 2024 and 2023, respectively. Meanwhile, 70 per cent of companies stated that their operations had not been negatively impacted by the national security laws. In fact, the legal provisions of the HKNSL and the SNSO, including their definitions, scope of application and target activities, are clearly defined. They also explicitly stipulate that property and investments within the HKSAR are protected by law. These laws in no way hinder the normal commercial activities or international exchanges of various organisations operating in Hong Kong. Judges, in handling all cases – including those involving national security – discharge their judicial duties independently and impartially, free from any interference. In the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index 2024, Hong Kong maintained a high overall ranking, ahead of the United States and certain countries that frequently make unfounded criticisms of Hong Kong's rule of law and human rights.""

The spokesman said, ""Amid the intensifying geopolitical tensions, and rising unilateralism and protectionism that disrupt the international trade system and global economic order, Hong Kong will, as always, continue to steadfastly uphold its status as a free port under the 'one country, two systems' principle. We will maintain free trade policies and a simple, low tax regime, while ensuring the free flow of capital, information, goods and talent – fully leveraging our role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder'. We will proactively integrate into the overall national development plan and align with national development strategies. In addition to consolidating our strengths in the traditional sectors, we are committed to nurturing emerging industries and expanding into new sectors. While deepening ties with established markets, we are also making great strides in enhancing our engagement with the Global South. We cordially invite enterprises and talent from around the world to invest, establish businesses, and develop their careers in the city, and to jointly seize the promising opportunities presented by Hong Kong's bright future."""
特區政府強烈反對美國國務院投資環境報告,2025-09-28 22:00,2025-09-28 22:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800731.htm,"特區政府發言人今日（九月二十八日）表示，美國國務院發表的《投資環境報告》（《報告》）中對香港營商環境多有偏頗的陳述，其中對《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》更是繼續惡意抹黑、作出無理失實的指控，特區政府對此表示強烈不滿和反對。發言人重申：「國安法律的實施，讓香港恢復安全穩定的環境，不僅保障了市民大眾的權利和自由，同時也讓香港成為更吸引國際資金和投資的安全港。種種數據顯示，香港卓越的營商環境對海內外企業和資金都極具吸引力，其核心優勢與特區政府推動經濟社會發展的努力，亦廣獲國際認同。《報告》中各種偏頗不實的說法，在事實面前顯得理虧無據、蒼白無力。」

「事實上，今年以來，港股表現暢旺，恆生指數上升了約30%、新股集資額大幅增長，位列全球第一；銀行存款上升約8%，接近19萬億港元。資產和財富管理業去年管理資產總值按年增長13%至超過35萬億港元，香港有望在數年內成為全球最大的跨境財富管理中心。這些數字都顯示國際投資者紛紛以實際行動對香港的營商環投下信心的一票。」

「在多項關於經濟自由度、金融、創科、教育、人才等的國際競爭力排名中，香港續創佳績、排名上升。香港是全球最自由的經濟體、世界三甲的金融中心、全球競爭力排名第三，也與深圳和廣州共同組成世界第一的創新集群。」

「根據聯合國貿易和發展會議發表的《2025年世界投資報告》，二○二四年，香港的外來直接投資流入金額高達1,260億美元，排名上升至全球第三位。截至去年，有近10 000家母公司在海外及中國內地的企業選擇香港作為基地，創歷史新高。其中，母公司在美國的公司近1 400家，同比上升9%。自二○二二年底至今，引進重點企業辦公室已吸引逾80間重點企業在香港落戶或拓展業務，其中不少是從事前沿科技的全球領軍企業。今年首八個月，投資推廣署共協助了超過440間企業在港開設或擴展業務，較去年同期增加14%，來自海外及中國內地的企業約各佔一半，證明香港繼續是海外及中國內地企業開設及擴展業務的理想地方。」

發言人指出：「在『一國兩制』下，香港特區繼續實行普通法、堅定維護法治，司法機構一直獨立行使審判權。根據各項調查，在港外商普遍對香港的法治抱有高度信心。例如，香港美國商會在今年初發表的年度會員調查顯示，有83%在港美企對香港法治有信心，比二○二四年及二○二三年分別增加4個及10個百分點；70%的企業指它們的運作沒有受到國安法律的影響。事實上，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的法律條文，包括定義、適用對象和範圍，均相當清晰，亦明確規定香港特區內的財產和投資受到法律保護，完全沒有窒礙各類組織在香港的正常商業行為和國際交流需要。法官在處理任何案件，包括涉及國家安全的案件時，均獨立公正地履行司法職務，不受任何干預。在「世界正義工程」去年公布的《2024年法治指數》，香港整體排名維持高位，繼續領先於美國和一些不時無理批評香港法治和人權狀況的國家。」

發言人指出：「當前地緣政治、單邊主義和保護主義加劇、衝擊國際貿易體系和全球經濟秩序，香港在『一國兩制』下，將一如既往堅定保持自由港的地位、實行自由貿易、簡單低稅制等政策，維持資金、資訊、貨物和人才自由流動，發揮『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的角色和功能。我們會積極融入國家發展大局、更主動對接國家發展戰略，既鞏固優勢產業，更培育新興產業和領域；在深化與傳統市場關係的同時，又努力拓展與全球南方市場的聯繫。我們歡迎海內外的企業和人才來港投資興業和發展事業，與我們共享未來亮麗的發展機遇。」"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-28 17:30,2025-09-28 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800536.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 28), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 23 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

 
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

"Emergency repair works for pressurised sewage rising main at Mills and Chung Path, Southern District, Hong Kong Island completed by DSD",2025-09-28 16:04,2025-09-28 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800485.htm,"âThe Drainage Services Department (DSD) completed the emergency repair works for a pressurised sewage main at Mills and Chung Path, Southern District, Hong Kong Island this morning (September 28). The repaired sewage main has resumed service.

During a routine inspection on September 25, the DSD found that there were multiple damage along a section of pressurized sewage main, about 60 metres long and 450 millimetres in diameter at Mills and Chung Path, Southern District, Hong Kong Island, which was caused by the passage of Super Typhoon Ragasa. The DSD immediately suspended the use of the damaged sewage main and diverted sewage to the emergency sewage treatment facilities at the Repulse Bay Main Sewage Pumping Station. The sewage underwent chemically enhanced settlement and disinfection before being discharged into the sea, while emergency repair works on the affected sewage main were carried out.

As the concerned sewage pipe is located on a natural rocky shore under Mills and Chung Path with no direct vehicular or pedestrian access, the DSD's engineering team had to build a temporary work passage and platform for carrying out emergency repair works round-the-clock. During execution of the repair works, temporary traffic arrangements were implemented on Island Road to transport construction equipment and materials.

The DSD has immediately notified the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) upon completion of the repair works today. The EPD has arranged to collect seawater samples from Deep Water Bay Beach and Repulse Bay Beach for water quality testing. The test results are expected to be available tomorrow. If the results are satisfactory, the EPD will notify the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to reopen the beaches."

Remarks by S for Health at media session on cancer screening programmes (English only),2025-09-28 14:18,2025-09-28 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/28/P2025092800418.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, at a media session after attending a radio programme this morning (September 28):

Reporter: As the Government is rolling out new cancer screening programmes, including hepatitis B, how many people are expected to benefit from the schemes? Is there a timetable for that? Also, as the scheme has a co-payment platform, how many per cent would be paid by the people themselves? Can you elaborate more on how AI can be utilised in this cancer screening programme?

Secretary for Health: In the Policy Address this year, the Chief Executive has announced that we will initiate some other cancer screening programmes, including using the study of artificial intelligence for the screening of lung cancer, which is in fact the number one cancer in Hong Kong. And also hepatitis B, which is the most common cause for liver cancer in Hong Kong - accounting for over 80 per cent of the cases, will also be included in the programme. The other thing is about the HPV virus - the human papillomavirus - screening for cervical cancer. These are the three programmes we will be rolling out in addition to the existing ones for collateral cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer screenings.

  Regarding the platform we will be using, for hepatitis B, for example, we will be incorporating it into our existing Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme, which is at present targeting at patients with high blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol level. We will be using the same platform and the same kind of model for co-care, and following the same situation. The percentage of subsidy of co-care will be roughly in ""half-half"", that is the concept we are going forward.

  For individual cancer screening progamme, this is a study which will be commissioned with a university. As we figure out that for cancer screening, it requires radiology most of the time. Low dose CT scan is the existing screening modality. We will be targeting at certain high-risk groups, for example, those with family history of lung cancer. These are not the smoking-related squamous cell carcinoma. We are targeting at the more recent rising incidence of adenocarcinoma of lung. We will identify high-risk groups for screening, and it will be a commissioned project, which we will start likely at the beginning of 2026.

For hepatitis B screening, we will be targeting at the high-risk population as well. These are the family members of known chronic hepatitis B carriers. As you may know, we have already initiated the universal hepatitis B vaccination for all newborns since 1988, so people who are born after 1988 would have received vaccinations. The chronic carrier rate is very low, under one per cent. On the other hand, for those born before 1988, they may not have received vaccination. In fact, the chronic carrier rate is still at the region of about 7.8 per cent. We estimate there will still be roughly over 400 000 chronic hepatitis B carriers, and 40 per cent of them are yet known - they don't know that they are carriers themselves. The most common population among those are the family members, so these are the targets that we are looking at, and that will be the programme we will be rolling out.

Reporter: Do you have an estimation like how many people are targeted for the hepatitis B screening?

Secretary for Health: For hepatitis B carriers, among the chronic carriers, we have roughly estimated that there are about 700 000 family members, and roughly about 40 per cent are eligible for screening, so we will be looking at the region of about 300 000 people. We will go by phases, and initially will be targeting at this high-risk population.

Reporter: Is there a target time for that?

Secretary for Health: We will be announcing the programme within this year, and we will be definitely incorporating it into our Chronic Disease Co-Care Platform, in which existing ones are screenings for hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. We will be mobilising our District Health Centres, all general medical practitioners and family doctors in the community, and that will help us build up a platform incorporating these parties, building up a concept of ""Family Doctor for all"". Thank you."
