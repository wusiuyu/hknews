HKO and SCHSA remind public that weather will cool appreciably in next few days (with photo),2025-11-17 16:10,2025-11-17 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700217.htm,"  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and the Senior Citizen Home Safety Association (SCHSA) held a joint press conference today (November 17) to remind the public that the weather will become appreciably cooler in the next few days and to prepare for winter.

  The Acting Assistant Director of the HKO, Ms Tse Shuk-mei, said at the press conference, ""A cold front is moving southwards. It is expected to move across the coast of Guangdong around midnight tonight. Under the influence of the associated intense northeast monsoon, it will be windy and appreciably cooler in the next couple of days. Meanwhile, under a broad band of clouds, it will be cloudy with one or two light rain patches in Hong Kong. On Wednesday and Thursday, temperatures will drop to about 14 degrees in the urban areas, and it will be cold over parts of the New Territories. As it will be windy, wind chill effect will be rather significant. It will still be cool in the morning later this week. The public, especially the elderly, persons with chronic medical conditions, or those planning for outdoor activities, should pay attention to the changing weather and take appropriate precautions.""

  The Chief Executive Officer of the SCHSA, Ms Maura Wong, said, ""The SCHSA's 24/7 'Care-On-Call' Service Centre sees a sharp rise in requests for assistance every winter. Last winter, we handled an average of 95.6 emergency-aid requests per day via the 'Care-On-Call' system, which is 12.6 per cent more than the daily average in 2024. We urge the elderly to keep warm and request assistance through 'Care-On-Call' services promptly if they feel unwell. Caregivers should also proactively care for the elderly around them and make sure they receive appropriate support.""

Mr Grimaldi (Chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Mr Emanuele Grimaldi), your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, all the distinguished guests that have come to this summit today,

Good afternoon. As we bring this impactful Summit to a close, may I express my gladness seeing that our discussions in the past two days have powerfully demonstrated how our global maritime community is navigating shared challenges - from trade realignment and supply chain resilience to financing our industry’s future. These dialogues have been frank and collaborative, as to be seen from our closed-door session yesterday as well as today's sessions, reflecting our common goal and the spirit of partnership we all value. During the summit, we have heard a number of buzzwords: fragmentation, deglobalisation, protectionism, unpredictability, collaboration, partnership and most important of all - solutions.

Scene setting

In an era of volatility, isolation or unilateralism is certainly not the solution. It must be forged through partnership. The government's role is not to direct, but to enable - to build the fundamental and foundational backbone that allows the private sector to innovate, invest and thrive. This philosophy underpins our recent establishment in Hong Kong of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB) under the able leadership of the Honourable Dr Moses Cheng (Chairman of the HKMPDB, Dr Moses Cheng Mo-chi), ensuring government and industry work as co-pilots in shaping our maritime future.

Guided by this principle and bolstered by our nation's strong support, Hong Kong adopts a clear dual strategy: reinforcing the resilience of our local maritime ecosystem, while expanding opportunities in the Chinese Mainland and in the rest of the world.

First, we are enhancing both our port competitiveness and world-class maritime services. Our port's efficiency remains a key advantage, with vessel-handling speeds nearly double the global average - earning us the ""catch-up port"" reputation. We are capitalising on this by establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal system to extend our cargo hinterland into inland provinces of the Chinese Mainland. Meanwhile, we are not only driving digital and green transformation through launching a new Port Community System for real-time cargo tracking amongst all stakeholders, we are also working, with the port operators, toward reducing our Kwai Tsing Container Terminals' carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

Complementing our port assets, we have an unparalleled cluster of over 1 200 shipping and maritime service companies, including the world's top ship managers, major protection and indemnity clubs and leading financers, as supported by one of the world’s largest fleets by gross tonnage flying the Hong Kong flag. To future-proof this leadership, we are streamlining our shipping registry procedures, enhancing tax incentives for the ship lessors and shipping commercial principals as well as introducing tax concessions for commodity traders, with legislative amendments coming right next year. Further, we will strengthen collaboration with international marine insurance organisations to upscale the training of marine insurance talents, whilst expanding the scope of the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund to cover more green energy courses, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong maritime strengths.

Secondly, we are proactively forging international partnerships to unlock new growth potential and solidify our role as a global ""super connector"". To counter protectionism, we are building partner port relationships with strategic ports in the Chinese Mainland and key Belt and Road regions for enhancing mutual competitiveness and resilience. Do expect our announcement of the first batch of our partner ports shortly later today. At the same time, central to this strategy is the Hong Kong Maritime Week itself, including the ICS World Trade Summit - our cornerstone platform for deepening international exchanges and collaboration. Every November, this gathering transforms our city into a vital nexus where global industry leaders converge to shape and drive positive changes for the future of the maritime trade. I am excited to share with you that we will be welcoming the Silk Road Maritime Association's summit one year from now during Hong Kong Maritime Week 2026, so stay tuned. This event and the week-long event will foster a strategic dialogue to unlock new opportunities in Belt and Road shipping for Hong Kong and the global community.

Despite the postponement in the IMO(International Maritime Organization)'s schedule, which we touched upon a lot during these two days, we, in Hong Kong remain steadfast in advancing our pace to strengthen and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international green maritime fuel bunkering and trading hub. Our prime location at the southern tip of China places us at the crossroads of international fairways, ideal for serving the global shipping community's bunkering needs. We rank seventh globally in shipping fuel bunkering, second in China and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Since the first LNG (liquefied natural gas) bunkering operation in February this year, over 200 000 metric tonnes of biodiesel and LNG have been bunkered in Hong Kong, involving a total of 13 LNG bunkering operations. Having established biodiesel and LNG bunkering, we are pioneering the next-generation fuels - including methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen. We will commence feasibility studies for ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and mandate mass flow meters for methanol operations by next year. Further, leveraging our nation's green fuel supply advantages and Hong Kong's robust financial infrastructure, we are developing a global green maritime fuel trading centre, hosting various matchmaking events to catalyse supply chains and support our nation in reinforcing its leadership in this emerging sector.

The geopolitical landscape today affirms that the old rulebook is being rewritten. In this new chapter, Hong Kong's value proposition under ""one country, two systems"" becomes more relevant than ever after - offering a stable, sophisticated common law platform with a trusted legal framework, free flow of capital and information, as well as professional expertise that de-risks global trade. Hong Kong is here to serve and facilitate you to not just navigate today's challenges, but seize tomorrow's opportunities.

Ladies and gentlemen, while this Summit is about to conclude, I trust that the collaboration and dialogue will go on. As Hong Kong Maritime Week continues with other events, I look forward to welcoming you there.

Thank you to the ICS, our co-organisers, and all of you for your invaluable contributions. Congratulations to the ICS for, once again, hosting and staging such a successful summit this year. I wish you a productive remainder of your time in Hong Kong and enjoy the buzz and the nice weather outside of the Asia's World City. Thank you."

Speech by CE at Opening Ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 cum World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025 (English only),2025-11-17 14:47,2025-11-17 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700412.htm,"Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Opening Ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 cum World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025 today (November 17):

Honourable Vice Chairman C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Honourable Director Zhou Ji (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government (CPG) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Vice Minister Fu Xuyin (Vice Minister of Transport), Deputy Head Chen Feng (Deputy Head, Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR), Acting Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR), Chairman Miao Jianmin (Chairman of China Merchants Group), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. A very warm welcome to Hong Kong, Asia's world city, and to the opening of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 and the fifth World Maritime Merchants Forum, which bring together our maritime cluster, and underline Hong Kong's status as one of the world's leading maritime centres.

  The theme for the Hong Kong Maritime Week, ""Navigating to a Greener Future"", signals our shared destination. Complementing this, the theme of the World Maritime Merchants Forum, ""Steering Sustainability Through Changes"", is our navigational chart for the journey ahead.

  In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action.

  In this era of profound and complex transformation, Hong Kong's role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of ""one country, two systems"" is the cornerstone of our success, providing us with an unshakeable foundation.

  As our country's only bilingual common law jurisdiction, Hong Kong offers a simple and low tax regime, free port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

  Our standing is consistently acknowledged, and endorsed, by the international community. For the sixth consecutive year, Hong Kong ranked fourth, globally, in the International Shipping Centre Development Index. This pays tribute to our strengths in port infrastructure, maritime services and overall operating environment.

  Hong Kong is home to more than 1 200 port and maritime-related companies, a thriving cluster of global leaders in ship management, finance, insurance and law. The Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association's launch ceremony, in just a few minutes, will mark a milestone development, further enriching our maritime services and reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

  Our tax concession regime for high value-added maritime services continues to attract global businesses. And we are planning to extend half-rate tax concessions to physical commodity traders, further integrating the critical pillars of trade, commodities and shipping here in Hong Kong.

  Beyond our business-friendly foundations, our focus is firmly on the future. And the imperative for green growth is the defining challenge, and opportunity, of our generation.

  With the International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework targeting to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in international shipping by around the year 2050, Hong Kong is determined to be at the forefront, as a premier green maritime fuel-bunkering centre.

  Since publishing our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering a year ago, we have materialised regular commercial liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkering.

  Our vision is to become the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. And our proximity to the Chinese Mainland, the world's largest producer of green maritime fuel, is a critical advantage. We will continue to collaborate with maritime associations and business partners globally to drive the transition towards sustainability.

  Indeed, collaboration on an unprecedented scale is essential as we face challenges from geopolitical tensions, trade protectionism, technological disruption, and the climate crisis - issues too vast for any single economy to solve alone.

  Let's work together to build green shipping corridors and digital trade lanes that will define the future of safe, efficient and sustainable global shipping.

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is ready to be your partner. Our policy support, expertise, strategic vision and unwavering commitment can play a pivotal role in navigating the next era of shipping. Together, we can steer a course towards a more sustainable, prosperous and collaborative future.

  I wish you all a rewarding Hong Kong Maritime Week, a productive World Maritime Merchants Forum, and fair winds and following seas, in business as in life. Thank you."
創新科技及工業局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-17 13:57,2025-11-17 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700338.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十一月十七日）出席香港國際電腦會議2025開幕儀式後會見傳媒的談話內容：

創新科技及工業局局長：各位媒體朋友，各位市民，大家早上好。今天我很高興向大家分享一下，最近香港特區政府關於加快推進創科產業發展的情況。大家知道，國家「十五五」規劃建議明確支持香港建設國際創新科技中心，特別強調科技創新與產業創新融合發展，加速建立國家的現代化產業體系。香港將會緊密對接國家的發展戰略，加速建設國際創新科技中心。

在這樣一個大的環境下，我們最近推出了幾項措施。第一項措施是在本周四（十一月二十日），我們將會公布北部都會區《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》。概念綱要主要從三部分闡述未來新田科技城產業發展的定位、產業和空間地塊的分布，以及發展模式。關於定位，大家知道我們未來新田科技城主要定位於創科產業的發展。我們將會聚焦幾大領域，包括生命健康、人工智能與機械人、微電子與智能設備、新能源、新材料及綠色科技等，主要是聚焦以先進製造為核心的香港創科產業體系的建設。在發展上，我們更多聚焦於一些產品的原型、中試產業，以及小規模生產。根據香港的特色因地制宜，也會考慮重點發展一些適合香港情況的重點創科產業。

第二項是關於新田科技城產業發展的布局。我們會根據土地推出的持續情況，分五個階段去發展未來新田科技城。具體來說，我們會提出要打造「三個樞紐」作為核心區，包括河套、洲頭和麒麟。圍繞「三個樞紐」，我們會布局產業帶。我們特別要強調產業、人才和空間的相互配合和促進，打造「產城融合」這樣一個宜居城市。第三個方面是關於發展模式。我想在發展模式方面，特區政府會遵照「有為政府」，加上「高效市場」的大原則，我們會建議成立一家「平台公司」，借助市場力量，加速發展新田科技城。

除了剛才我介紹的新田科技城的發展規劃之外，大家可能注意到上個星期我們也迎來了一個重要的里程碑，就是「創科產業引導基金」已經正式啓動基金經理的申請程序。這是本屆特區政府推出的第三個以產業發展為導向的百億元計劃。這個百億元計劃目的是通過政府適當的投資和引領，來撬動更多市場資本投資未來具策略性的創科產業，打通香港創科產業發展的「最後一公里」。基金將會聚焦於五大板塊，包括生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人、半導體與智能設備、數字化與轉型升級，再有就是未來與可持續發展。在每個板塊下，我們會設立一到數個子基金，每個子基金由普通合夥人（General Partner, GP）作為基金經理管理。政府將會作為有限合夥人，總共投資100億元到各個子基金去。過去一段時間來，我們已經成功吸引了一定數量的策略投資人加入到「創科產業引導基金」作為有限合夥人。我們也繼續邀請更多策略投資人加入到這個基金。我主要是跟大家介紹一下這兩個最近推出的重點舉措。謝謝大家。

記者：想請教剛才說新田科技城的定位是生命健康、人工智能科技，好像跟以前提過河套的定位差不多，其實將來的分布會是怎樣，會有甚麼不同？

創新科技及工業局局長：我想新田科技城的定位與河套，包括其他香港的科技園是有不同的，新田科技城主要定位於產業發展，我們發展產業。產業發展來說是重點打造以先進製造為核心的產業，希望建立起香港的創科產業體系。河套的定位主要做一些R&D（研發），也會做一些中試發展。新田科技城會提供成片土地供企業在這裏面做大規模生產，我們會做產品原型、中試，也鼓勵做一些小規模生產。另外，根據香港的特色，我們也會考慮發展幾個適合香港特色的、稍為大規模的產業。就在這點來說的話，它跟其他園區的定位是有所不同的。

記者：局長，有沒有一些例子是適合香港的產業，大概是哪些？以及剛才提到該布局分五階段，是哪五個階段？有沒有時間表？

創新科技及工業局局長：關於定甚麼樣的產業，這次這份新田科技城的規劃綱要是我們之前委託顧問團隊，過去兩年來做了周密的研究。我們走訪了40多個團體，會見了超過100個創科界的人士。根據各種統計結果，我們提出了幾大產業分布，就剛剛我提到的，包括生命健康、機械人、人工智能、新材料、新能源等等。這都是認為是可能適合香港未來發展的方向。具體最終哪幾個方向能夠做得更好，下一步還要聽市場的反饋。所以，下一步我們會重點考慮要引入一些龍頭企業，通過龍頭企業的引入能夠帶動上下游的發展。關於你說的五個發展期是怎麼定的，我想這主要是根據我們未來收地的程序，再有就是根據我們產業進駐的情況。我們大概提出了五個階段，當然也可能在未來的發展中會根據情況做一些調整。總而言之，我們希望未來能夠加速發展，能夠通過新田科技城匯聚全世界的創科資源到這個地方。

記者：有沒有時間表大概第一階段是何時？

創新科技及工業局局長：我想具體的時間，馬上周四，我們會公布這樣一個規劃概念綱要的詳細情況，我想到時候可以參閱。

記者：最後想問發展模式是否傾向公私營合作？之前《施政報告》提過的直接批地是否方向之一？

創新科技及工業局局長：我想發展模式主要爭取「有為政府」加上「高效市場」這大原則，我們會提出建立一個「平台公司」，「 平台公司 」可以參考比如現在科學園或者數碼港這樣的形式。一方面加強政府的引領，保證長期的規劃，同時要充分借助市場的力量、市場的資源、市場的開發速度和效果。這樣的話，我們希望能夠政府與市場相結合，能夠高速度、高質量的快速建立起新田科技城的創科產業。謝謝大家。"

It gives me great pleasure to welcome so many distinguished clinicians, scientists, and healthcare professionals to the International Genomic Medicine Symposium.

  This Symposium brings together experts and leaders from more than 20 countries and regions, and is a remarkable platform for sharing ideas and building partnerships across disciplines, institutions, and borders. It stands as a testament to the power of global collaboration.

  As a ""super connector"", Hong Kong proudly connects people, expertise, and opportunities from around the world to drive the development of genomic medicine together. We are all united by one shared mission: to translate the promise of genomic medicine into real and lasting benefits for patients and families.

  Genomic medicine represents one of the most exciting frontiers in modern healthcare. It is redefining how we understand, diagnose, and treat disease - driving progress from disease prevention early detection and precise diagnosis to personalised treatment, and groundbreaking advances in clinical trials and drug discovery.

  Recognising the profound potential of this field, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has made genomic medicine a key pillar of the city's journey to promote healthcare and innovation.

  We set up the Hong Kong Genome Institute in 2020. The Institute's vision statement is ambitious yet simple - to avail genomic medicine to all for better health and well-being. Over the years, with strong government support, the Institute has become a driving force linking clinical practice with cutting-edge science.

  At the centre of the Institute's work stands its flagship initiative - the Hong Kong Genome Project - the city's first large-scale whole-genome sequencing programme. The Project has at least three main goals: to build a comprehensive genome database for the Hong Kong population, to nurture a professional workforce in genomic medicine, and to set standards for genetic and genomic testing across the healthcare system.

  Through strong collaboration among the HKSAR Government, the Hospital Authority, and local universities, the Project has already recruited more than 53 000 participants. Indeed, this figure has already exceeded the original target of 50 000 participants, which was set from the Project's inception in 2021.

  The impact of this growing effort extends beyond Hong Kong. At present, human genome databases shared internationally are largely Caucasian-based, accounting for over 70 per cent of all the data involved. Through the Hong Kong Genome Project, Hong Kong is building a unique genome database rooted primarily in the Southern Chinese population. By expanding the representation of Asian genomic data, Hong Kong is not only closing a critical gap in global knowledge, but also opening up new possibilities for more knowledge generation.

  The genomic data, and clinical information, collected through the Project are de-identified and stored in the Hong Kong Genome Institute's bioinformatics analytical platform for access by authorised researchers. As the Project's database continues to grow, it will allow for more targeted participant stratification, accelerating the discovery of new drugs and the development of precision therapies.

  Looking ahead, the HKSAR Government will continue to support the Hong Kong Genome Institute as the Institute embarks on the next phase of work, pressing ahead with its 2025-2030 Strategic Plan. The Plan sets four priorities: to integrate genomic medicine into clinical care; to advance research in genomic science; to nurture talent in genomic medicine; and to enhance public genomic literacy and foster industry partnership.

  The Institute will expand the Hong Kong Genome Project, enrolling a further 60 000 to 70 000 participants over the next five years. This larger genome database will contribute to accelerating novel gene discoveries, driving medical innovations from new diagnostic tests to precision therapies, and strengthening collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry on new drug trials and pharmacogenomics.

  Turning scientific discoveries into practical applications will take centre stage in the Hong Kong Genome Institute's next phase of work. The Institute will forge partnerships with research institutions and industry leaders not only in Hong Kong, but across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and beyond, to advance - and bring to market - innovative genomics technologies and products.

  I am confident that many of you at today's Symposium will join - or continue to join hands with - the Hong Kong Genome Institute in realising the immense transformative potential of genomic medicine.

  And all these ongoing and future efforts of the Institute go hand in hand with the HKSAR Government's new initiatives to facilitate the development and application of biomedical innovations in Hong Kong. To name a few, such initiatives include reform of medical product regulation, the setting up of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation, and the establishment of the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute to provide a one-stop clinical trial support platform.

  All in all, we are determined to strengthen Hong Kong's role as an international health and medical innovation hub. With high-quality and efficient healthcare systems, state-of-the-art research facilities and capabilities, strong support from our motherland, and extensive international connectivity, Hong Kong is well placed to drive new breakthroughs that enhance community well-being and contribute meaningfully to global health.

  Today's Symposium provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on these ambitions from the perspective of genomic medicine. It features five thematic panel discussions that will explore various key frontiers - from managing rare diseases and applying precision medicine, to addressing the legal and ethical dimensions of data sharing, driving innovations in health-record management, and harnessing the power of artificial intelligence.

  Following this Symposium, Hong Kong will have the honour of hosting the annual meeting of the RDI-LCRD over the next two days. This milestone underscores Hong Kong's role as a hub for global scientific exchanges and collaboration. It also reflects the international community's confidence in our city's research environment and clinical excellence.

  Before closing, to our distinguished guests from the Chinese Mainland and overseas who have travelled from near and far, I hope you find your stay in Hong Kong both enriching and enjoyable. Beyond scientific exchanges, I invite you to experience the city's vibrancy and its unique blend of East-meets-West culture.

  And to our local participants, I encourage you to build on the connections made today - to keep the dialogue going and work together to improve patient care and public health. I would also like to make a brief appeal to you, as members of Hong Kong’s professional and scientific community. On December 7, Hong Kong will hold the 2025 Legislative Council General Election. I encourage each of you - and your family members - to vote in the election, because the choices you make will shape the policies that foster research, healthcare, and the well-being of present and future generations.

  On that note, I wish the Symposium, as well as the RDI-LCRD's annual meeting, every success. Thank you."

Speech by FS at Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit (English only) (with photo),2025-11-17 11:36,2025-11-17 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700255.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Dr Emanuele Grimaldi (Chair of the International Chamber of Shipping), Your Excellencies, Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a pleasure to welcome you all to the second Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit, co-hosted by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, and the newly formed Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board.

  This important event brings together more than 300 global maritime leaders from some 30 economies for vital dialogue and collaboration. Your presence speaks to the global significance of the discussions here.

  I would like to thank the ICS for once again choosing Hong Kong to host this pivotal summit, casting a strong vote of confidence in us as an international maritime centre. Representing over 80 per cent of the world's merchant fleet, your leadership in shaping the global maritime agenda is unparalleled.

Building Resilience in an Age of Transformation

  The theme of this Summit - ""Building Resilience, Driving Growth and Investment"" - speaks directly to our moment. Global maritime trade is no doubt facing headwinds: geopolitical tensions, tariff escalations, and new trade barriers are reshaping shipping routes and disrupting established patterns. The UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) Review of Maritime Transport 2025 forecasts seaborne trade growth of merely 0.5 per cent this year, down from 2.2 per cent in 2024 - the slowest pace in years. Vessel rerouting has pushed ton-miles to record levels, forcing ships to travel longer distances at higher cost.

  Yet this is not necessarily a story of decline, but of transformation. Allow me to offer three observations.

Shifting maritime trade patterns

  First, in my view, geopolitics will reshape rather than weaken maritime trade flows. Consider China. It has stood as the world's largest manufacturing economy for 15 consecutive years, commanding close to 30 per cent of global manufacturing output. It has an industrial ecosystem spanning the entire classification of industrial categories recognised by the United Nations. Despite talk of supply chain diversification, no country possesses China's completeness, scale, efficiency or integrated capacity. Indeed, supply chain reconfiguration arising from trade tensions is creating a complementary, not substitutional, relationship across the region.

  While Southeast Asian nations are attracting more investments and manufacturing activities, in this process, they are reinforcing the two-way trade flow with China, in raw materials, components, semi-finished goods and finished products. As a matter of fact, China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)trade reached a record of some US$690 billion in the first eight months of 2025. Hong Kong, as a key re-export hub, has witnessed substantial growth in this business.
 
  As a manufacturer, China will continue to demand vast quantities of raw materials and components from Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific (like Australia). Meanwhile, as a consumer market of 1.4 billion people with a rapidly expanding middle income group, China will drive continued growth in the import of food, fashion, electronics, and more.

  At the same time, Southeast Asia, with approximately 700 million people with a median age of 32, is experiencing a significant demographic dividend. More importantly, their incomes are rising substantially. By 2030, ASEAN will contribute 140 million new consumers, representing 16 per cent of the world's new consumer class.

  Beyond Asia, the broader Global South, currently accounting for 18 per cent of global GDP, is projected to grow at 4.2 per cent annually through 2029. By 2033, South-South trade is expected to approach US$14 trillion.

  I believe this economic dynamism will be reshaping maritime trade. Intra-regional trade is emerging as a powerful engine of growth. Intra-Asia container volumes are projected to reach more than 42 million TEUs (Twenty Equipment Unit) by 2028, representing 3.8 per cent growth per year, outpacing the global average.

  The maritime sector itself is evolving, too. Intra-regional trade is driving demand for smaller, fuel-efficient vessels optimised for short-sea shipping. Scheduling patterns are also shifting to accommodate new supply chains and regional trade growth. Bulk commodities remain dominant in seaborne trade, and containerised cargo - including consumer electronics, automotive components, and renewable energy products - is experiencing robust growth, particularly in intra-Asia routes.

Decarbonisation as both imperative and opportunity

  My second observation is that decarbonisation of maritime operations is both an imperative and opportunity. The IMO (International Maritime Organization) has set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050. This is not environmental aspiration alone. It is regulatory reality.

  To this end, the liner shipping industry is making substantial progress, with 79 per cent of the deadweight tonnage of container and vehicle carriers capable of operating on renewable fuels. Yet scaling green fuel production and creating financial mechanisms to support adoption remain challenging. It requires strong political commitment and cross-sectoral collaboration.

  The opportunity is substantial. Maritime decarbonisation represents a multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunity through 2050. The transition to zero-emission marine fuels could create up to 4 million jobs globally across the energy supply chain. Here in Hong Kong, we are embracing this. For example, we have published an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, positioning ourselves as a regional hub for sustainable fuel supply. Our goal is to provide bunkering services for green fuels to ocean-going vessels more than 60 times per year by 2030, involving over 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels.

Harnessing digital transformation

  My third observation is on technology's transformative power. Ports and global container lines are commonly deploying artificial intelligence, blockchain and advanced data analytics to improve operational efficiency, optimise routes, and reduce downtime and carbon emissions. This is where Hong Kong also comes in, with our vibrant technology and startup community. Many of them are pioneering innovations in smart logistics. They can play a role not only in supporting our own transformation but also in serving the broader region.

  Technology is also reshaping what is shipped and how. As consumer preferences shift and companies adopt new production methods, the mode of maritime trade also evolves. Consumers are now preferring sustainable, traceable products, driving demand for supply chain solutions that can verify environmental and social credentials in real time. Besides, the speed of technology adoption in operation and management will determine competitive success in this decade. Those who are able to digitalise their operations will reduce costs, capture market share, and be better able to meet the expectations of increasingly sophisticated customers and regulators.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, the maritime industry stands at a pivotal moment. Geopolitical fragmentation, shifting patterns of global commerce, climate imperatives and technological advancement are formidable forces. Yet they create opportunity precisely because they demand agility, innovation and vision.

  Yes, the currents are shifting, and the waters may be uncharted. But like the explorers in the Age of Discovery, there lies tremendous opportunity for those with the vision to navigate with strategy, courage and conviction. I am convinced that the voyage ahead is one of extraordinary growth for those who are willing and ready.

  On this note, I wish you all a most rewarding Summit, and the best of health and business in the time ahead.

  And for those of you coming from afar, I would like to appeal to you: don’t just work, but enjoy the city. We have wonderful hiking trails, beaches, about 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants, great museums, and above all, we don’t impose duty on wine! And remember to shop till you drop! Thank you."

å°æ¬çè¬å¯§å¯é¨é· (Deputy Director-General of the Youth Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Ms Wan Ning), Mr Dave Chen (President of the Hong Kong Computer Society), Mr Andre Blumberg (Conference Chairperson of the HKICC 2025), Professor Jin Hai (Vice President of the China Computer Federation), Dr Albert Wong (Programme Chairperson of the HKICC 2025), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you all today at the HKICC 2025. The Conference has long served as a vital platform for cross-sector dialogue and technological advancement. This year's theme, ""Scaling AI Transformation Beyond Experimentation"", captures a timely and important leap in AI development.

 AI is evolving from exploratory initiatives to real-world applications, driving productivity, resilience and competitiveness across sectors. In addition to the national proposal of the ""AI+"" initiative last year, the 15th Five-Year Plan announced last month reaffirms our country's support for Hong Kong to develop as an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. With national support and a strategic foundation in place, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is committed to contributing to the country's prosperity by building an AI ecosystem where innovation flourishes, collaboration deepens and impact lasts.

 The HKSAR Government took a number of moves to accelerate the conversion of AI concepts into impactful applications. A key milestone is the establishment of Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) in late 2024, which will further be ramped up this year to meet the growing demand for high-performance computing power. We hope that this AISC will provide the necessary infrastructure for R&D (research and development) breakthroughs to be transformed into scalable business solutions for enterprises. We have also put in place the AI Subsidy Scheme to enable easier access for local research institutions and companies to these supercomputing resources.

 Furthermore, the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute will be established next year to serve as Hong Kong's dedicated AI institution. The Institute will focus on the full development cycle, from upstream research to midstream transformation, as well as downstream industry adoption. We are also going to enhance the Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to assist eligible small and medium-sized enterprises in adopting off-the-shelf AI solutions in their daily operations.

 In parallel, the Government is accelerating the development of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone (Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone) in the Loop (Hong Kong Park), where AI is positioned as one of the key pillar industries. To facilitate scientific research and AI application testing, we are actively exploring with the relevant Chinese Mainland authorities the expansion of the cross-boundary flow of research data from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong for use by enterprises and organisations in the Hong Kong Park. We believe the establishment of a cross-boundary data flow management mechanism will facilitate safe and convenient flow of data between the two places.

 In addition, a 10-hectare site at Sandy Ridge in the Northern Metropolis will be developed into a high-tier data facility cluster, providing advanced computing infrastructure to support data-intensive innovation across AI and data-driven industries. This will further strengthen Hong Kong's position as a regional digital infrastructure hub, and advance the development of a digital economy and smart city initiatives.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's AI journey is entering a new chapter. As we lay the infrastructural foundation and provide the necessary policy support, we call for collective efforts from across sectors to build the future of Hong Kong AI development, and participants of today's Conference are definitely our key partners on this front.

 Before I close, may I invite all registered voters to cast your vote on the polling day on December 7. My sincere gratitude goes to the Hong Kong Computer Society for bringing together this impactful event. I wish the HKICC 2025 another year of great success! Thank you."

Test results and WSD's follow-up work regarding water supply incident affecting some Taikoo Shing residents,2025-11-16 23:50,2025-11-17 00:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600776.htm,"Regarding the appearance of black particles in the drinking water of some buildings in Taikoo Shing, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) had earlier collected water samples from some households, sump and roof drinking water tanks for testing. A spokesman for the WSD stated tonight (November 16) that the analysis has just been completed, showing that all water samples have met Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards. The small amount of black particles found in the samples were confirmed to be bitumen. It is believed that water pressure changes caused by WSD's temporary redirecting of water supply near Taikoo Shing last night stirred up bitumen sediments inside the pipes. These sediments are inert substances and pose no harm to human health.

The spokesman said that the WSD had already issued a press release earlier today explaining the cause of the incident (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600466.htm), adding that the damaged filter at the estate's public water inlet was repaired last night, and pipe flushing has been strengthened. To minimise inconvenience to residents, the WSD, together with the estate's property management company, arranged for cleansing of the sump drinking water tanks of affected buildings starting tonight at off-peak water usage hours (around 12:30am), expected to finish by dawn. Cleansing of roof drinking water tanks will follow tomorrow morning during off-peak water usage hours, with completion expected within the day. After these follow-up actions, the situation of black particles in drinking water is expected to improve significantly.

Further investigation showed that the affected buildings are mainly in phases four and five, totalling 14 blocks, about 20 per cent of the estate. WSD staff have been dispatched to work with the property management office to assist residents in flushing water meters and water heater inlets. As of 9pm today, about 100 water meters have been flushed, and more than 20 technicians have been arranged to flush electric water heater inlets. These actions will continue tomorrow.

To reassure residents, the WSD will continue to place water trucks and tanks in the estate to provide temporary water supply services, and set up a service counter and work together with the property management office to answer residents' enquiries immediately. If residents notice abnormalities in their drinking water, they should notify the management office at once or call the WSD customer service hotline at 2824 5000, and arrangements will be made promptly for follow-up.

The spokesman added that to prevent occurrence of similar incidents in the future, the WSD will not only conduct routine regular inspections of the estate's inlet filters, but also check the filters before and after pipe maintenance works to ensure they remain in good condition and can effectively block sediments stirred up during such works."

發言人表示，水務署今日較早時已就事件起因發出新聞公布（https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600356.htm )，並交代屋苑公共水管入水口的破損濾網設施昨晚已完成修復，並已加強沖洗水管。此外，為減少事件對居民帶來的不便，水務署聯同屋苑物業管理公司已安排於今日晚上非繁忙用水時間（約凌晨12時30分）開始清洗各受影響大廈的地下食水貯水缸，預料清晨完成，繼而在明日早上非繁忙用水時間後開始清洗各受影響大廈的天台食水貯水缸，預計相關清洗工作於明日內完成。經上述跟進行動後，相信食水出現黑點的情況會大有改善。

發言人表示，進一步調查顯示受影響座數主要來自第四期及第五期共14座大廈，佔總座數約兩成。署方已派員與物業管理處一同跟進及協助居民沖洗水錶及熱水爐的入水位。截至今日晚上九時，署方已安排並完成沖洗約100個處所的水錶，亦已安排20多個技工到場沖洗電熱水爐的入水位，相關行動明日會繼續。

為讓居民更安心，署方會繼續在屋苑放置水車及水箱以提供臨時供水服務，以及於屋苑設立服務站，與物業管理處一同即時解答居民查詢。如居民發現食水出現異常，請立即通知管理處，或致電本署客戶服務熱線2824 5000，我們會盡快安排專人聯絡及跟進。

發言人表示，為避免同類事件再次發生，水務署除日常定期檢查屋苑入水口的濾網，亦會在進行水管維修工程之前及之後再次檢查濾網的狀況，確保濾網狀況保持良好，能有效阻隔因水管維修工程而被揚起的沉積物。"

政制及內地事務局局長：謝謝大家。今日下午是我們選委界別的選舉論壇，整體來說我們的安排及各方面，我們都覺得是暢順的，包括50位候選人都全數出席，這不但顯示大家非常重視這個論壇，亦很重視這個機會，向他們的選民——選委去介紹自己的政綱和參選情況。同時，我們在現場看到，各選委與候選人之間的互動都是很良好的，充分顯示到團結和友好的選舉氛圍。我們亦都看到打氣團隊的氣氛亦相當好、很熱烈，同時亦井然有序。最難得的是，我們看到今次有超過1 100名選委參加這個論壇，看到大家都非常重視這次選舉，亦很熱切地希望了解各個候選人的情況，從而作出投票的選擇。整體來說，包括氣氛和安排上，我們覺得已經達致預期效果，亦能夠讓各個候選人闡述他們的政綱和理念，讓各位選委考慮。多謝大家。

記者：首先想問，今次的論壇一次過讓50位候選人參與，都是講述政綱，沒有回應問題時間，其實這還算是一個論壇嗎？為何會有這個設定？第二，想問每位候選人都有兩分半鐘時間發言，但剛才看見的情況是，其實很多候選人都講不完，甚至剛剛有候選人說因為時間緊迫而要精簡地説。這樣理想嗎？

政制及內地事務局局長：我們已說過，這39場論壇都會因應實際情況而制定和考慮整體安排。因應這次的選委界別，因為我們始終希望論壇，第一，會是一氣呵成的，因為如果組織幾次的話，由於選委有接近1 500名，要他們在同一時間出現，大家的公務都比較繁忙，所以我們希望能夠可以一次過安排。否則的話，（選委）有些場次可能會來，有些場次可能不來，這可能會造成不公的情況。在這個情況下，亦因應時間上的考慮，如果時間過長的話，也未必是個很理想的安排。所以，因應種種的因素，我們設定了今次這個環節是這樣安排，亦看見他們（候選人）都可以充分地講述他們的政綱以至抱負等各方面，這亦達致我們希望令選委更加了解他們的情況的這個目標。

記者：局長，去到尾段有不少選委離場，會否覺得對之後的候選人有不公平的情況出現？又想請教，我們都見到在選委區的座席上，有些並不是選委的人坐在那裏觀看，我想問問這是否符合局方本身的要求和安排呢？

政制及內地事務局局長：首先，我看到現場，而大家也看到，本身人數都相當多，正如我所講，有差不多1 100名選委出席這個論壇。當然，大家都知道選委他們本身很多時候公務都是很繁忙的，他是否會一直觀看到最後論壇結束，這要視乎實際情況以及他本身的工作時間。但問題是，就算他因事要提前離開都好，我們有提供「節目重溫」，他亦可以重看往後環節中候選人的情況，可以充分重看。的而且確，有部分選委很想了解候選人的情況，但因為時間上未必能夠親身參與，他們之前都有跟我們說過，希望可以由部分代表或者助理來到現場，聽完後再把情況轉述，從而讓他了解情況，亦有這種情況，我們都歡迎。總之可以有機會讓候選人充分地講述他們的政綱，令選委能夠充分了解，我們覺得都可以作一些彈性安排。

記者：剛才打氣環節時，五組一起（打氣），出現「疊聲」，大家聽不清楚，這個情況會不會覺得有更好的改善空間呢？第二條問題，今次邀請了選委和打氣團，但一般市民不能出席。為甚麼不邀請市民出席？會否使互動感欠缺一點？

政制及內地事務局局長：首先第一件事，我們經常說，每一個論壇我們都會因應實際情況，包括場地和時間各方面，再整體作一個設計安排。在打氣方面，雖然不是（每位候選人各有）一個獨立的打氣時間，因為時間都是一個考慮因素。如果時間過長，亦可能會影響觀眾出現疲勞的情況。所以我們的整體安排就是這樣，我們會一次性去看看情況。另一方面，我們覺得（這樣安排）氣氛會更濃厚，我們看到舉牌和候選人號碼等，各方面都可以清楚展示到候選人的打氣情況。就這一點，我認為今次的論壇已達到預期的目標。

當然，在任何情況下，我們都會因應情況作出優化。接着仍有多場論壇，我們會根據情況再作考慮。另外，剛才大家都看到，基本上現場已經滿座。選委、候選人及打氣團，基本上已坐滿整個場地。我們亦常常說，我們有現場直播，亦提供「節目重溫」，各位市民可以透過這些去了解情況。

記者：有兩條問題想問，首先想問（選舉委員會界別論壇）與地區直選的論壇相比，少了一個候選人在台上互動的環節，這樣會不會令選民對於候選人的理念、彼此的理念認知未夠深刻？另外想追問，昨日有候選人不適送院，大會說會聯絡他們跟進，最新的跟進情況是怎樣？會否造成不公，或者會提供時間讓她補回政綱、理念？

政制及內地事務局局長：基本上這都是與我剛才的說法一樣，每一場論壇都會因應其實際情況，包括場地或候選人的數目，這些都要考慮，時間亦是需要考慮的。我們就今次的選舉論壇安排了三小時進行，共有50位候選人，如果環節的數目太多，或者時間太長的話，這亦未必符合實際情況。所以我們覺得就這次安排來說，都可以讓參選人有機會將其政綱及各方面的想法向選委交代，這已經達致我們的目標。

記者：關於昨天有候選人暈倒的情況？

政制及內地事務局局長：關於昨天身體不適的候選人，我們很高興從她的個人Facebook得知，她的身體現時已沒有很大問題，我希望她可以早日康復。同時，我們亦會待她的身體狀況好轉時聯絡她，視乎她的意願，如有需要我們可以作出相關安排。謝謝大家。"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-16 18:15,2025-11-16 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600526.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 16), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 62 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases and the rest were imported cases.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the recent outbreak of CF has shown a sustained downward trend. There were 48 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (November 9 to 15), showing a further decrease compared to the previous week (November 2 to 8), which reported 107 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Jiangmen (14 cases) and Shenzhen (12 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
--------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding the recently announced local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP is still conducting genome analysis.

The CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 500 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past one day. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and one of them testednegative for chikungunya virus. Laboratory testing for the remaining samples is continuing.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

WSD closely follows up on water supply incident affecting some Taikoo Shing residents,2025-11-16 16:30,2025-11-16 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/16/P2025111600466.htm,"Regarding the appearance of black particles in the drinking water of some Taikoo Shing households, a spokesman for the Water Supplies Department (WSD) stated today (November 16) that the department is closely following up on the situation. Since receiving the notification from the Taikoo Shing management office last night (November 15) that residents (mainly from phases four and five) had found small black particles in drinking water, the WSD immediately dispatched staff to look into the incident. Water samples were collected from affected households and the sump and roof drinking water tanks of the buildings for laboratory testing. Results are pending. Based on past experience, the black particles are believed to be bitumen protective coating in the water pipes.

To facilitate pipe maintenance works, the WSD carried out temporary redirecting of water supply near Taikoo Shing last night in which the changes in water pressure may have disturbed sediment inside the pipes. At the same time, investigations revealed damage to one of the filter facilities at the estate's public water inlet, which may have allowed a small amount of sediment to enter the estate's public water pipes, causing particles to appear in some households' drinking water. The WSD routinely inspects these inlet filters, with the most recent regular check on November 3 showing no abnormalities. The damaged filter was repaired last night, and the WSD has strengthened pipe flushing in the affected system.

The WSD understands residents' concerns. To safeguard users, it is advised that if water has remained in pipes for some time, or when using taps for the first time each morning, residents should let the water run until it becomes clear before consumption. To reassure residents, water trucks have been stationed on-site to provide temporary water supply.

Additionally, the WSD has set up a service counter at the site, working with the property management office to assist residents in flushing water meters and to answer enquiries immediately. If residents notice abnormalities in their drinking water, they should notify the management office at once or call the WSD Customer Service Hotline at 2824 5000. The WSD will arrange for staff to follow up as quickly as possible."
