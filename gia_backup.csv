在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-13 06:45,2025-08-13 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300008.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 13) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

DH investigates incident of RCHD administering COVID-19 vaccines beyond recommended use-by date,2025-08-12 20:00,2025-08-12 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200622.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (August 12) is investigating an incident involving a private doctor participating in the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme who administered COVID-19 vaccines that exceeded the recommended use-by date to seven residents of a residential care home for persons with disabilities (RCHD). The relevant COVID-19 vaccines have not exceeded their expiry dates, and none of the affected individuals reported feeling ill. The DH has requested that the affected institution and doctor concerned to take immediate remedial action to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents and to closely monitor the health conditions of the affected persons. The concerned doctor's vaccination service under the Vaccination Schemes has been suspended.

Upon reviewing the vaccine orders and vaccination records, the DH found that the doctor concerned administered Spikevax JN.1 COVID-19 vaccines that were beyond the recommended use-by date to seven residents at Hong Chi Fanling Integrative Rehabilitation Complex, an RCHD in Fanling, on May 22. While the COVID-19 vaccines concerned have not exceeded their expiry dates, they should be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius after thawing and used within 30 days, according to the manufacturer's recommendation.ã ãã

The DH is highly concerned about the incident and has taken immediate actions to follow up on the health conditions of the affected persons. It has been confirmed that none of the affected residents suffered from adverse events as a result of the vaccination. The DH has sought information from the vaccine manufacturer on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine under the above circumstances. Taking into account the history of COVID-19 vaccination and infection of the affected persons, the DH advised that there is no need for the affected individuals to be revaccinated. The DH has instructed the doctor in question to monitor the health conditions of the affected residents. At the request of the DH, the visiting doctor will explain the incident to the affected persons or their relatives and discuss subsequent arrangements.ã ãã

Meanwhile, the DH has inspected the RCHD concerned to check the storage of vaccines and vaccination procedures. To avoid the recurrence of similar incidents, the staff have been urged to follow the requirements of regular checking of the recommended use-by date of the vaccines, separate storage of vaccines with different recommended use-by dates, and timely disposal of expired vaccines in accordance with the guidelines of the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme.

The DH has suspended the vaccination service of the doctor concerned under the Vaccination Schemes and will continue to follow up on whether the institution concerned have complied with the relevant guidelines of the DH.

To remind private doctors and residential care home staff how to properly store and administer COVID-19 vaccines to the public, the DH conducted three briefing sessions for the industries in late July and early August. Participants included doctors participating in the Programme, staff members of RCHDs and residential care homes for the elderly. They were reminded of the key points to note when administering COVID-19 vaccines. The DH also stressed that the recommended use-by date must be checked before administering the vaccines for the public.

In response to this incident, the DH will send letters again to remind doctors participating in the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme to strictly adhere to all procedures recommended by the DH when providing vaccination services."

CFS urges public not to consume a prepackaged ice cream detected with coliform bacteria count exceeding legal limit,2025-08-12 19:32,2025-08-12 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200600.htm,"âThe Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (August 12) urged the public not to consume a kind of prepackaged coconut flavoured ice cream, which was found to contain coliform bacteria with its count exceeding the legal limit. The trade should stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it.

Details of the product are as follows:

Product name: Original Coconut Gelato
Brand: Make Meanings
Place of origin: Hong Kong
Net volume: 70ml
Best-before date: January 21, 2026
Manufacturer: Pay & Pay Ice Cream International Company Limited
Distributor: Cheung Wo Food Supply Company Limited

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a vending machine in Tseung Kwan O for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained 140 coliform bacteria per gram, exceeding the legal limit.""

Under the Frozen Confections Regulation (Cap. 132AC), frozen confection for sale should not contain more than 100 coliform bacteria per gram. The maximum penalty for offenders is a fine of $10,000 and three months' imprisonment upon conviction. The fact that the coliform count exceeded the legal limit indicated that the hygienic conditions were unsatisfactory, but did not mean that consumption would lead to food poisoning.

  ""The CFS has informed the manufacturer and the operator of the vending machine concerned of the irregularity and instructed it to stop selling the affected ice-cream product immediately. The CFS has also immediately sent staff to the frozen confection factory concerned to conduct an investigation and took samples for testing. Health education on food safety and hygiene was provided to the person-in-charge and staff of the frozen confection factory concerned. They have also been requested to carry out thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises,"" the spokesman said.

For the sake of prudence, the CFS has instructed the above-mentioned manufacturer to stop sales, remove from shelves the affected batch of the product and to initiate a recall. Members of the public may call the hotline at 5548 9226 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

The spokesman advised members of the public to stop consuming the affected product and seek medical treatment if they feel unwell after consuming the product concerned.

âThe CFS has alerted the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. An investigation is ongoing."

The new case involves a 31-year-old male with good past health who lives in Kwai Tsing District. Preliminary investigations revealed that he travelled to Foshan in Guangdong Province from August 1 to 3. He could not confirm whether he had a history of mosquito bites. Upon returning to Hong Kong, he developed a fever, rash and joint pain on August 8. He travelled to Shenzhenon August 9 and attended a hospital there the next day. He was not admitted and returned to Hong Kong on the same day. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital yesterday (August 11) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is currently in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

 Since the patient stayed in Foshan during the incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel, and the case was classified as imported. The patient has no travel collaterals and his household contacts are currently asymptomatic and are under medical surveillance. The CHP will continue its epidemiological investigation and has reported the case to the health authorities of Guangdong.

 Hong Kong has recorded a total of six confirmed CF cases this year, all of which are imported cases, as well as one probable case. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, in the past week (August 3 to 9), there were 1 387 new CF cases in Guangdong, a significant decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 2 892 cases (July 27 to August 2) and 2 940 cases (July 20 to 26) respectively. All the cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. However, we must remain vigilant and continue to adopt a multipronged approach to prevent local transmission,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow up when necessary.

To raise the awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

 Dr Tsui reminded members of the public, currently, there are no rapid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for public use in self-testing for CF. They should promptly seek medical advice if they suspect they are infected with CF and not to conduct testing on their own as this may delay proper clinical treatment. He also urged the public not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example, increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to ""Reye's syndrome"", a serious and potentially fatal complication.

He also added that members of the public should adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can effectively prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 andpicaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生署調查殘疾人士院舍接種超出建議使用日期新冠疫苗,2025-08-12 19:00,2025-08-12 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200579.htm,"​衞生署今日（八月十二日）正調查一名參與新冠疫苗接種計劃的私家醫生為七名殘疾人士院舍院友接種超出建議使用日期新冠疫苗的事件，相關新冠疫苗並未超出其有效日期，受影響的人士均沒有不適。衞生署已要求涉事院舍和醫生立即改善疫苗管理措施以避免類似事件發生，並須密切跟進受影響人士的健康情況。涉事醫生亦已被暫停在疫苗接種計劃下的服務。

衞生署在核對疫苗預訂及接種紀錄時，發現涉事醫生於五月二十二日到粉嶺一間名為「匡智粉嶺綜合復康中心」的殘疾人士院舍提供疫苗接種服務時，為七名院友接種了超過建議使用日期的莫德納JN.1新冠疫苗。雖然相關新冠疫苗並未超出有效日期，但根據疫苗製造商的建議，該疫苗須於解凍後儲存於攝氏2至8度，並於30日內使用。

衞生署高度關注事件，已即時跟進受影響人士的健康情況，並確定所有受影響的院友均沒有因為接種疫苗而出現不良情況。衞生署亦已向疫苗製造商了解疫苗在上述情況下的安全和效能等資料。經詳細考慮受影響人士的新冠疫苗接種及新冠感染史，衞生署建議受影響人士無需重新接種疫苗，並已指示涉事醫生監察受影響人士的健康狀況，而該名醫生亦會按衞生署要求，向受影響人士或其家屬解釋事件及商討其後安排。

另一方面，衞生署已巡查涉事殘疾人士院舍，檢查疫苗儲存及接種程序，並督促職員必須定時檢查疫苗的建議使用日期、分開存放不同建議使用日期的疫苗，以及按照2019冠狀病毒病疫苗接種計劃指引適時處置已過期的疫苗，避免同類事件再發生。

衞生署已暫停涉事醫生在疫苗接種計劃下的疫苗接種服務，並會繼續跟進涉事院舍是否有遵從相關指引。

為提醒私家醫生和院舍負責人員如何妥善存放和為市民接種新冠疫苗，衞生署已於七月底和八月初向業界舉辦三場簡報會，提醒參與計劃的醫生、殘疾人士院舍及安老院舍的員工為市民接種新冠疫苗必須注意的事項，並強調為市民接種新冠疫苗前必須先檢查相關疫苗的建議使用日期。

因應今次事件，衞生署會再去信提醒所有參與新冠疫苗接種計劃的醫生，提供疫苗接種服務時須恪守衞生署建議的所有程序。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-12 18:35,2025-08-12 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200554.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月十二日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。中心提醒市民，不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。

最新個案資料

新增個案涉及一名居於葵青區的31歲男子，他過往健康良好。初步調查顯示，他於八月一日至三日到過廣東省佛山市，未能確定自己曾否被蚊叮。他回港後，於八月八日起出現發燒、皮疹及關節痛。他於八月九日到深圳市，翌日到當地一間醫院求診，無須留醫，並於同日回港。他昨日（八月十一日）到仁濟醫院急症室求診，獲安排入院，在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於病人潛伏期身處佛山市，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人沒有其他同行人士，他的家居接觸者現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得六宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案，以及一宗可能個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三日至九日）廣東省新增1 387宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別為2 892宗（七月二十七日至八月二日）及2 940宗（七月二十日至二十六日）明顯減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然如此，我們仍不能掉以輕心，必須繼續多管齊下，避免出現本地傳播。」

中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，目前，市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證的快速測試產品，供市民自行測試基孔肯雅熱。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。市民亦不應自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

他補充，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食物環境衞生署（食環署）呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

開幕電影《天堂旅行團》（2025），講述生活一團糟的男主角意外遇上古靈精怪的小女孩，展開一趟歡笑與淚水交織的公路旅行，讓彼此灰暗的人生帶來一點光。

《祝你幸福！》（2024）以一對離婚夫婦與喪子老人之間命運交織的故事，探討愛與放手的平衡。《朱同在三年級丟失了超能力》（2024）以兒童的視角勾勒成人世界的荒誕，故事講述校園生活充滿困難的插班生朱同，發現腦中天馬行空的幻想突然成為現實，引發一連串怪事。《家庭簡史》（2024）中家境優渥的三口之家被一個神秘少年的出現打亂，電影運用懸疑片的包裝，細緻剖析現代家庭所面對的內部危機。《負負得正》（2024）以不按常規的敘事和結構，展現兩個「不完美」的都市男女，從碰撞到互相理解的微妙愛情。

《我們一起搖太陽》（2024）講述兩個身患重病的年輕男女，訂下「一紙契約」在生命倒數中互相扶持，在幽默中展現人性的韌力與豁達。《野孩子》（2024）取材自真實故事，講述流浪青年和孤兒在殘酷的生活中互相守護，一起成長。《穿過月亮的旅行》（2024）中分隔兩地的小夫妻為了在中秋節團聚，不約而同地登上奔向對方的列車，卻不斷擦身而過，在失落與期盼之間，對愛的力量有更深刻的認識。《長沙夜生活》（2023）透過串連起城市不同角落的小人物故事，以長沙的地標與景點作背景，訴說城市各式各樣的喜怒哀樂。

Chinese Film Panorama 2025 presents Mainland films of diverse styles (with photos),2025-08-12 18:20,2025-08-12 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200341.htm,"  The Chinese Film Panorama 2025, jointly presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and the Southern Film Culture Foundation, will be held from September 10 to October 29. Twelve films produced on the Mainland with a variety of styles and themes will be screened, and two of the films were selected for free screenings for public appreciation.

  The opening film, ""Always Have Always Will"" (2025), follows a man with hard luck unexpectedly going on a road trip full of laughter and tears with a quirky young girl, bringing a glimmer of light into each other's gloomy lives.

  ""Enjoy Yourself"" (2024) tells the story of a divorced couple crossing paths with an older couple who have lost their only child, exploring the balance between love and letting go. Depicting the absurdities of the adult world through a child's perspective, ""Day Dreaming"" (2024) is the story of the fantasies of a mischievous transfer student Zhu Tong becoming reality, setting off a chain of bizarre events. In ""Brief History of A Family"" (2024), the seemingly happy life of a middle-class family of three is disrupted by the arrival of a teenager. In the guise of a suspense thriller, the film depicts the impacts faced by families in a modern world. Using an unconventional narrative and structure, ""Land of Broken Hearts"" (2024) depicts the journey of delicate love between two imperfect urban youths, from confrontation to mutual understanding.

  ""Viva La Vida"" (2024) follows a young man and a young woman, both suffering from serious illnesses, entering a contract to carry each other through the final days of their lives. Seasoned with humour, the film shows the tenacity and stoicism of humanity. Based on a true story, ""Stand By Me"" (2024) tells the story of a street youth and an orphan looking out for each other to survive their cruel reality while growing up side by side. ""I Love You, to the Moon, and Back"" (2024) follows a married couple who are separated geographically and each boards a train looking forward to reuniting with the other during the Mid-autumn Festival, only to keep passing each other by. In disappointments and hopes, they gain a deeper insight into the power of love. ""Tale of the Night"" (2023) takes viewers on an emotional journey through a city with the stories of ordinary people, highlighted by the popular spots of the city of Changsha.

  In ""Gone with the Boat"" (2024), after an elderly woman has been diagnosed with a brain tumour, her children bicker over the best way forward. Through depicting the woman facing the passing of her life with grace, the film offers deep insights into death and family relations. ""Eye for an Eye 2"" (2024) follows a blind swordsman avenging a tragedy caused by the people in power turning a blind eye, while the world sees clearly the rotten reality. The animated feature ""I Am What I Am 2"" (2024) continues the inspiration and passion of its predecessor while showcasing again the prowess of Chinese animation. In the film, a young lion dancer signs up for a martial arts tournament to raise money for his ailing father. He faces not only formidable opponents but also prejudices and his internal struggles.

  Admission to the following two films will be free by ticket. Each person can obtain up to two tickets per screening on a first-come, first-served basis. Details of ticket distribution are as follows:

Inclusion of etomidate under voluntary testing of Healthy School Programme,2025-08-12 18:00,2025-08-12 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200347.htm,"The Narcotics Division (ND)of the Security Bureau today (August 12) said that it has written to schools to confirm the inclusion of etomidate in the voluntary drug testing under the Healthy School Programme in the 2025/26 school year.

  The ND today met with non-governmental organisations responsible for administering the drug tests to work out the details of etomidate testing under the Healthy School Programme. The procedures for etomidate testing will follow that of other drugs - participating schools may opt for rapid urine tests or hair tests under the current testing procedures, and testing will only be conducted after receiving a student's consent. Personal data collected during the voluntary testing are protected under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486). The testing procedures and implementation details can be found in the updated ""Reference Protocol for the School Drug Testing Scheme"" (www.nd.gov.hk/en/HSP.html).

The Healthy School Programme, supported by the Beat Drugs Fund, is a school-based anti-drug education initiative. The Programme is divided into two parts, including diversified personal growth activities and voluntary school drug testing by students. It aims to enhance students' resolve to stay away from drugs, establish a drug-free culture in schools, and encourage those in need to seek help. Currently, more than half of Hong Kong's secondary schools participate in the Programme. Apart from etomidate, the voluntary school testing covers drugs including ketamine, ecstasy, methylamphetamine, cannabis, and cocaine. The Programme incorporates comprehensive downstream support programmes, which include counselling, treatment, rehabilitation and referral services to handle and follow up on relevant cases.

The ND will continue to closely communicate with schools and testing teams of non-governmental organisations and review the operation of the Healthy School Programme from time to time in response to prevailing drug trends. For enquiries about the Programme, the ND can be reached by phone at 2867 5974/2867 5975/2867 5976 or by email at sb-hspdt@sb.gov.hk."

Professor Lo said, ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is pressing ahead with the healthcare reform and incorporating the concept of co-ordinated development of healthcare services, healthcare protection and drugs into the reform framework to tie in with the national healthcare reform direction.

  ""On healthcare services, we are committed to advancing the primary healthcare development, as well as reforming the governance and structure of the Hospital Authority (HA) to enhance the quality and efficiency of public healthcare services. On drugs, we have put forward the vision of moving towards 'primary evaluation' through reforming the approval and registration mechanism for drugs and medical devices. To this end, we have implemented the '1+' mechanism for approval of new drugs and enhanced the arrangements for introduction and procurement of drugs and medical devices for public healthcare. As for healthcare protection, the Public Healthcare Fees and Charges Reform jointly announced by the Health Bureau and the HA in March this year will not only restructure the subsidisation levels for various services in a precise manner but will also enhance healthcare protection, thereby providing Hong Kong citizens with a larger, more stable, thicker and denser public healthcare safety net.""

The delegation then met with the CRIS. Professor Lo said, ""The Chief Executive announced relevant strategies to develop Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub in his 2023 and 2024 Policy Addresses. The HKSAR Government will leverage the advantages of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, and jointly establish a one-stop clinical trial collaboration platform through the synergistic collaboration between the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute located in the Hong Kong Park and the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trials Center located in the Shenzhen Park. Furthermore, the HKSAR Government will establish the Real-World Study and Application Centre by the end of this year to provide real-world data support for the approval of drugs and medical devices. The Government will also establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of 2026 and implement 'primary evaluation' for new drug registration in phases beginning next year.""

Customs intercepted a 38-year-old man who was pulling a pallet of cargo with a pallet truck for inspection at the Chung Ying Street Checkpoint in Sha Tau Kok on May 12. During customs clearance, the man failed to obey the lawful order of the Customs officers, and a total of 280 200 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from 24 styrofoam boxes of the consignment. The man was thus arrested. The estimated market value of the batch of duty-not-paid cigarettes was about $1.4 million, and the duty potential was about $926,000. 

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

SCED continues visit to New Zealand (with photos),2025-08-12 17:00,2025-08-12 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200414.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, arrived in Auckland today (August 12) to continue his visit to New Zealand.

 Upon arrival, Mr Yau had a lunch meeting with representatives of the New Zealand Winegrowers to learn about the latest developments in the local wine industry and explore further collaboration between Hong Kong and New Zealand on wine and liquor promotion.

 Mr Yau shared with them Hong Kong's advantages as a wine and liquor trading hub and its recent reduction of liquor duty by introducing a two-tier liquor duty system to encourage the trade and auctions of high-end liquor. This strategic policy adjustment is part of Hong Kong's efforts to strengthen its position as an international trading hub and create a more business-friendly environment for both domestic and international companies including New Zealand ones.

 Between 2013 and 2023, imports of spirits in Asia grew by almost 80 per cent, a significantly faster rate than the global increase of 42 per cent in the same period. The Mainland is now one of the largest importers of spirits. Mr Yau said that with Hong Kong's strategic location and unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the city is the best two-way platform for New Zealand's wine and liquor trade to tap into the fast-growing Asian and Mainland markets.

 In the afternoon, Mr Yau met with representatives of the New Zealand China Council and the Auckland Business Chamber respectively to update them on Hong Kong's latest developments, such as the Northern Metropolis development, and initiatives to attract enterprises and investment around the globe. They also exchanged views on forging business co-operation between Hong Kong and New Zealand and using Hong Kong as a gateway to explore the vast market of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

 In the evening, Mr Yau attended the Hong Kong Dinner cohosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade office, Sydney and the Hong Kong New Zealand Business Association. Speaking at the dinner, Mr Yau highlighted the close economic ties between Hong Kong and New Zealand since the signing of the free trade agreement between the two places in 2010. Today, Hong Kong stands as one of New Zealand's key trading partners in Asia. In 2024, New Zealand exported NZ$16 billion worth of goods and services to Hong Kong.

 Mr Yau said that the synergy between Hong Kong's service-oriented economy and New Zealand's world-renowned expertise in food and agriculture has created opportunities that go far beyond simple imports and exports, adding that the dynamic and resilient partnership will continue to evolve and thrive.

 Mr Yau will proceed to Sydney, Australia, tomorrow (August 13)."

丘應樺抵埗後，隨即與新西蘭葡萄種植與葡萄酒釀造協會的代表進行午餐會議，了解當地葡萄酒業界的最新發展，並探討加強香港與新西蘭就推廣葡萄酒及烈酒的合作。

丘應樺向協會代表介紹香港作為葡萄酒及烈酒貿易樞紐的優勢，以及最近透過引進雙層烈酒稅制調低烈酒稅，以促進高價值烈酒貿易拍賣的舉措。該項策略性政策調整反映香港致力鞏固其作為國際貿易中心的地位，並為本地及國際企業，包括新西蘭企業創造更友善的營商環境。

在二○一三年至二○二三年期間，亞洲進口烈酒產品錄得約80%增幅，遠較同期全球增長42%急速。內地已成為最大烈酒進口地之一。丘應樺說，憑藉香港的戰略位置和在「一國兩制」下的獨特優勢，是新西蘭葡萄酒及烈酒業界進軍正急速發展的亞洲及內地市場的最佳雙向平台。

丘應樺下午分別與新西蘭—中國關係促進委員會和奧克蘭商會的代表會面，介紹香港的最新發展，包括北部都會區發展，以及吸引環球企業和投資的措施。他們亦就加強香港與新西蘭的商貿合作，以及利用香港作為門戶以開拓粵港澳大灣區龐大市場交換意見。

晚上，丘應樺出席由香港駐悉尼經濟貿易辦事處與香港新西蘭商會合辦的香港晚宴。丘應樺在晚宴上致辭時強調，自香港與新西蘭於二○一○年簽訂自由貿易協定以來，兩地的經貿聯繫一直非常密切。香港至今已成為新西蘭在亞洲的主要貿易夥伴。在二○二四年，新西蘭向香港出口160億新西蘭元的貨物和服務。

丘應樺表示，香港是服務業主導的經濟體，新西蘭則以其食品和農業享譽全球，當中的協同效應所創造的機遇遠超一般進出口活動，這種充滿活力和韌性的夥伴關係將繼續蓬勃發展。

丘應樺明日（八月十三日）轉赴澳洲悉尼。"

Customs officers intercepted the incoming female passenger, aged 48, at Hong Kong International Airport on June 4. About 43 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $179,000 and a duty potential of about $145,000, were seized from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

She encouraged these enterprises to fully leverage Hong Kong's advantages as a ""super connector"" to complement the strengths of the Yangtze River Delta region.

  The conference was co-organised by the Department of Commerce of Guangdong Province, InvestHK, and the Macao Commerce and Investment Promotion Institute, attracting more than 200 representatives from industry enterprises, investment institutions, R&D institutions and business associations. Inspector at Level 2 of the Department of Commerce of Guangdong Province Mr Huang Xin; Ms Lee; and Director of the Macao Commerce and Investment Promotion Institute Mr Larry Leong, presented business opportunities in their respective regions at the conference, which is is one of the joint investment promotion activities conducted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao this year, aiming to deepen economic and trade co-operation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area). Assistant Commissioner for the Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Ms Cathy Li also attended the event.

  Ms Lee explained to the enterprises the unique advantages Hong Kong possesses as the most international city in the Greater Bay Area. ""Under the 'one country, two systems' principle, Hong Kong is backed by the country and connected to the world, serving as a global business hub. Hong Kong is not only the world's freest economy, but also Asia's leading international financial centre and the world's largest offshore Renminbi centre. As a 'super connector', Hong Kong seamlessly connects Mainland China with international capital markets through mutual access mechanisms, providing financing channels for enterprises"", she said. Leveraging its strengths as an international financial centre and a hub for high-calibre global talent, Hong Kong offers world-class research and development (R&D) infrastructure, top-notch academic research, a diverse talent pool, strong Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government policies and funding programmes, and a vibrant local start-up ecosystem for the development of I&T. She added, ""Hong Kong possesses the ideal conditions to attract investment and top talent from around the world, making it the best springboard for technology firms expanding overseas.""

  Addressing representatives from the AI and robotics industry at the event, Ms Lee provided an overview of Hong Kong's I&T development. She introduced various aspects, including Hong Kong's latest initiatives in AI development, such as the AI Supercomputing Centre already in operation at Cyberport and related funding policies; the InnoHK research clusters. and the city's 15 research centres focusing on AI and robotics; the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center, which aims to establish open-source and self-training AI foundational models; and the HKSAR Government's various funding policies for innovative technology companies in Hong Kong, as well as its policies for attracting I&T related talent.

  Ms Lee said, ""As a crucial national technological powerhouse, Hong Kong has been actively committed to the development of the AI ecosystem. The HKSAR Government is steadily implementing the development of AI in Hong Kong from all perspectives, including strategy, R&D, infrastructure, industrial development, data flow, applications, and talent."" She also highlighted InvestHK's free services for Mainland enterprises to set up operations in Hong Kong and expand their business globally, and promoted InvestHK's flagship events for the second half of the year. She encouraged companies in the Yangtze River Delta to leverage Hong Kong's advantages to expand into overseas markets.

  Mr Huang stated that the conference promoted precise connections between the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Yangtze River Delta region in multiple dimensions, including projects, markets, scenarios, and capital. He encouraged and invited enterprises from the Yangtze River Delta to seize the opportunity to personally experience and invest in the Greater Bay Area.

  Mr Leong also presented Macao's business environment and the development of I&T at the conference. He added that Macao will continue to deepen co-operation with various Mainland cities, fully leveraging its role as a bridge between China and Portugal, and serving as a ""precise connector"" between China and Portugal. This will help I&T enterprises to fully leverage the Greater Bay Area's policy dividends and Macao's unique advantages to achieve greater development in high-tech fields such as AI.

  Representatives from the Canton Investment Development Commission and the Investment Promotion Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality made investment promotion presentations for their respective cites on site.

  The second half of the conference also invited 28 companies in the AI and robotics industries to present their projects at the business matching meeting, encouraging them to interact with representatives from the Greater Bay Area.

環境及生態局局長在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會特別會議就防治蚊患及應對基孔肯雅熱的防控措施開場發言（只有中文）,2025-08-12 15:28,2025-08-12 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200435.htm,"以下是環境及生態局（環境局）局長謝展寰今日（八月十二日）下午在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會特別會議，就防治蚊患及應對基孔肯雅熱的防控措施的開場發言：

多謝主席。

大家好，今日我聯同衞生署衞生防護中心以及各相關部門，向委員會介紹政府防治蚊患應對基孔肯亞熱的工作。

基孔肯雅熱不會人傳人，是一種經蚊傳播的疾病，所以防蚊滅蚊是減低基孔肯雅熱傳播風險的最有效方法。環境及生態局上個月已召開政府跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會會議，統籌各部門採取行動，全面加強防蚊滅蚊工作。

蚊的活動範圍大約是100米左右。當發現輸入個案時，食環署（食物環境衞生署）會即時在個案病者的居所、入住的醫院，以及於傳染期停留過的地方的250米半徑範圍內進行調查和針對性的防蚊滅蚊工作，防止疾病透過蚊在本地傳播。

地區方面，食環署在19個區成立了跨部門地區專責小組，聯同各部門在公眾地方及政府場地進行防蚊滅蚊工作。

針對一些容易出現積水的地點，例如建築地盤，食環署會加強巡視，如發現有積水，會即時要求負責人清理。如處所負責人失責導致有蚊子滋生，食環署會採取檢控行動。在今年一月至七月期間，食環署已提出84宗檢控，包括77宗涉及建築地盤的個案。

食環署近日亦加強資訊發放，定期通過新聞公布和社交媒體，第一時間公布不同地區的蚊患指數。食環署更將原先在分區指數達20%時進行的強化防蚊滅蚊工作，擴展至指數超過10%的所有分區都會進行強化防蚊滅蚊工作。

社會大眾的參與亦十分重要。在這方面，環境局已和不同界別，包活滅蟲業界、物業管理、建造業及餐飲業會面，推動落實防蚊滅蚊。食環署亦已聯同各區民政事務處及區議會持續進行宣傳教育活動，亦會邀請地區人士及關愛隊協助，將防治蚊患的重要性帶進社區，令市民及早於家居採取防蚊及滅蚊措施。

接着我請歐家榮醫生向各位介紹衞生防護中心方面的工作。"

SLW visits Chengdu to exchange views on talent and social welfare policies (with photos),2025-08-12 14:34,2025-08-12 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200405.htm,"  The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, today (August 12) concluded his visit to Chengdu.

  Mr Sun began his visit yesterday (August 11) and first visited Sichuan University to meet with Vice President of the University Professor Zhao Changsheng to exchange views on deepening talent co-operation. Mr Sun stated that the Government is actively building Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent. Since Sichuan University was included in the aggregate list of eligible universities under the Top Talent Pass Scheme last November, over 800 graduates from the University have been approved to come to Hong Kong under the Scheme. Mr Sun welcomed Mainland youths to pursue career development in Hong Kong through suitable talent admission schemes.

  In the evening, Mr Sun attended the welcome dinner of the Sichuan Study and Exchange Tour under the Strive and Rise Programme to show support for the participating mentees. Apart from expressing gratitude to the Sichuan Provincial Government for the full support of the visit, Mr Sun thanked the co-organiser, Hong Kong Young Women's Christian Association, for its participation. He also thanked the Hong Kong Jockey Club for its sponsorship including funding for the implementation of the third cohort of the Programme and the Sichuan Study and Exchange Tour, and arranging for its staff to participate as mentors, which have broadened the mentees' horizons, enriched their knowledge, and boosted their confidence.

  At the dinner, Mr Sun also engaged in dialogues with mentees together with the Executive Director of Corporate Affairs of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Raymond Tam, where they shared their insights on life and work. They also listened to the sharing of mentees on their experiences and insights gained during their engagement in the Programme. Mr Sun encouraged the mentees to fully embrace the exchange opportunity and to draw knowledge across various fields within Sichuan's culture, technology, and history. He assured them that such experiences would serve as a valuable asset in their future growth, thereby strengthening their sense of identity and pride towards the motherland.

  This morning, Mr Sun first called on Deputy Director General of the Department of Civil Affairs of Sichuan Province Mr Li Lian to exchange views on policies covering social welfare, child protection, and elderly care services, to establish a foundation for interaction. Mr Sun later called on the Director-General of the Department of Human Resources and Social Security of Sichuan Province, Ms Liu Huiying, and held discussions covering labour, talent and social security policies between the two places to explore further collaboration opportunities.

  Mr Sun and his delegation will return to Hong Kong this afternoon."

孫玉菡昨日（八月十一日）展開訪問，首先到訪四川大學，與四川大學副校長趙長生教授會面，就深化人才合作進行交流。孫玉菡表示政府正積極打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地，自四川大學於去年十一月被納入高端人才通行證計劃合資格大學名單，已有超過800名該校畢業生透過計劃獲批來港。他歡迎內地年輕人透過合適的人才入境計劃來港發展。

他昨晚出席「共創明『Teen』計劃」四川學習交流團的歡迎晚宴，為參與計劃的學員打氣。除了感謝四川省政府全力支持此行，他亦感謝協辦機構香港基督教女青年會的參與，以及香港賽馬會的贊助，包括撥款支持第三期計劃推行及四川學習交流團，更安排員工擔任計劃友師，讓學員開闊眼界、增長知識和增強自信。

他在晚宴上聯同香港賽馬會公司事務執行總監譚志源與學員對談，分享他們對人生和工作的啓發，學員亦細訴參與計劃的經歷和得着。他勸勉學員珍惜是次交流機會，從四川的文化、科技及歷史中汲取不同領域的知識，相信這些經歷將成為他們未來成長道路上的寶貴財富，並增強對祖國的認同感與自豪感。

今日上午，孫玉菡先拜訪四川省民政廳，與副廳長李練會面，就社會福利、兒童保障及養老服務等政策進行交流，建立互動的基礎。孫玉菡隨後亦拜會四川省人力資源和社會保障廳廳長劉會英，就兩地的勞工、人才和社會保障等政策交換意見，探討更多合作的機會。

申訴專員陳積志今日（八月十二日）宣布展開全面調查，詳細審研政府就單車租賃店鋪引致的違泊問題的規管機制。

最近，申訴專員公署接獲巿民對民政事務總署（民政總署）、食物環境衞生署（食環署）、地政總署和運輸署提出的申訴。申訴人指稱新界有單車租賃店鋪長期把大量單車放置在店鋪外的行人通道，對行人構成阻礙甚至危險。申訴人曾向民政總署投訴，要求該署聯同相關政府部門採取跟進行動。然而，問題並無改善。

陳積志表示：「就處理違例停泊單車的問題，相關執法部門因應單車的停泊位置，根據法例採取適當的執法及清理行動，並在有需要時進行跨部門聯合行動。參與部門一般包括民政事務總署轄下相關的地區民政事務處、食環署、地政總署和運輸署。但問題往往持續甚至惡化，但另一方面商業單車租賃服務在不少社區實有需求。如何能提供單車租賃服務方便市民租用而不影響行人及避免引致意外發生，值得探討。因此，我決定展開全面調查，詳細審研政府就各區的單車租賃店鋪引致的違泊問題的規管機制，探討有否改善空間，提出改善建議。」

該玳瑁於二○二四年七月在長洲的南氹灣擱淺被市民發現，其後由漁護署人員救獲。經初步檢查後，牠被送往香港海洋公園，由該園獸醫進行詳細評估及持續觀察護理。

漁護署發言人說：「該玳瑁體重約11公斤，背甲長度約47厘米。經海洋公園獸醫評估，其健康狀況良好，適宜重回大海生活。署方感謝海洋公園對玳瑁的悉心照料。」

放歸大海前，漁護署為玳瑁植入晶片和扣上合金標誌，方便日後辨識身分，並在其背甲安裝衞星追蹤儀，以追蹤牠的動向和覓食地點，藉此蒐集數據，從而制定適當的保育措施。漁護署會與各地保育機構分享所得資料，以加強合作，合力保護海龜。

玳瑁屬於全球瀕危的海龜品種，間中在本地水域出現。所有野生龜類（包括海龜）在香港均受《野生動物保護條例》（第170章）保護，任何人士未經許可，不得捕獵、故意干擾、管有、售賣或出口海龜，違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁一年，有關物品亦會被充公。

此外，所有海龜品種亦已列入《瀕危野生動植物種國際貿易公約》附錄I，在香港受《保護瀕危動植物物種條例》（第586章）（《條例》）規管，任何人如非按照《條例》進口、從公海引進、出口、再出口或管有海龜，均屬違法。一經定罪，最高可被罰款一千萬元及監禁十年，有關物品亦會被充公。

Rescued hawksbill turtle returned to sea (with photo),2025-08-12 12:30,2025-08-12 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081100242.htm,"The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) released a hawksbill turtle into the southern waters of Hong Kong today (August 12).

The hawksbill turtle was found stranded at Nam Tam Wan, Cheung Chau, in July 2024 by the public and was subsequently rescued by AFCD officers. Following an initial examination, the turtle was sent to Ocean Park Hong Kong (OPHK) where it was assessed by veterinarians and placed under their continuous monitoring and veterinary care.

An AFCD spokesman said, ""The hawksbill turtle weighs around 11 kilograms and has a carapace length of about 47 centimetres. After assessment by OPHK's veterinarians, the turtle was found to be in good condition and fit to return to the sea. The department expresses gratitude to OPHK for their dedicated care.""

Before the turtle was released into the sea, the AFCD implanted a microchip and attached an Inconel tag for future identification. A satellite transmitter was also mounted on its carapace to track its movements and provide information on its feeding grounds, collecting data to formulate appropriate conservation measures. The AFCD will share the collected information with conservation authorities in other regions to enhance collaborative efforts in protecting sea turtles.

The hawksbill turtle is a globally endangered species and occasionally appears in local waters. In Hong Kong, all wild turtles (including sea turtles) are protected by the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance (Cap. 170). No person shall hunt or wilfully disturb, possess, sell or export sea turtles. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for one year, with the specimens forfeited upon conviction.

In addition, all sea turtle species are listed in Appendix I to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and are regulated in Hong Kong under the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance (Cap. 586). Any person who imports, introduces from the sea, exports, re-exports or possesses sea turtles not in accordance with the Ordinance has comitted an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $10 million and imprisonment for 10 years, and the specimens will also be forfeited.

The AFCD urges the public to report any sightings of sea turtles or suspected irregularities involving sea turtles to the department at 1823."
Ombudsman probes mechanism of regulating illegal bicycle parking caused by bicycle rental shops (with photos),2025-08-12 12:30,2025-08-12 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081100266.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (August 12) announced the launch of a full investigation to examine the mechanism of regulating illegal bicycle parking caused by bicycle rental shops.

The Office of The Ombudsman recently received a public complaint against the Home Affairs Department (HAD), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), the Lands Department (LandsD) and the Transport Department (TD). The complainant alleged that some bicycle rental shops in the New Territories persistently place a large number of bicycles along pedestrian walkways outside the shops, obstructing, even endangering, pedestrians. The complainant has notified the HAD, requesting that the department take follow-up actions with other relevant departments. However, the problem has remained unresolved.

Mr Chan said, ""In addressing the problem of illegal bicycle parking, the relevant enforcement departments are taking appropriate enforcement and clearance actions in accordance with the law, depending on the location of the bicycles. When necessary, interdepartmental joint operations are being carried out. The departments involved generally include the relevant District Offices under the HAD, the FEHD, the LandsD and the TD, etc. However, the problem persists and has even worsened. There is public demand for bicycle rental services in various districts. It is, therefore, worth exploring how bicycle rental services can be provided to enable cyclists without inconveniencing pedestrians and causing accidents. In this light, I have decided to launch a full investigation to examine the mechanism adopted by the Government to regulate illegal bicycle parking caused by bicycle rental shops in various districts and identify areas for improvement. Recommendations will be made accordingly.""

The Ombudsman welcomes views from members of the public on this topic. Written submissions should reach the Office of The Ombudsman by September 12, 2025:

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-12 11:50,2025-08-12 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200313.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 12) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Eligible students may apply for a means-tested subsidy (only for those students who have passed the means test) or a non-means-tested subsidy under the MUSSS. The subsidy under the MUSSS is granted on a yearly basis, and the subsidised period covers the normal duration of the undergraduate programme pursued by the student concerned in the designated Mainland institution. Eligible applicants may only receive either a means-tested subsidy or a non-means-tested subsidy in the same academic year. The MUSSS is not subject to any quota. It is envisaged that the MUSSS will benefit most Hong Kong students who are pursuing undergraduate studies on the Mainland and have different financial needs.

The subsidy under the MUSSS will be disbursed based on the distance between the locations of the institutions and Hong Kong, which will be grouped into three categories. Details of the subsidy rates under the different categories are set out in the Annex.

Details of the MUSSS are available on the EDB website (www.edb.gov.hk/musss). Eligible students are required to submit their applications via the MUSSS Electronic Application Platform (musss.edb.gov.hk) or send the completed application forms by post to the EDB on or before October 13.

尊敬的王松苗秘書長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室秘書長）、許正中董事長（紫荊文化集團董事長）、舒心院長（香港哲學研究院院長）、各位哲學界領袖、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興出席今天2025香港哲學紫荊國際論壇的開幕式，與一眾海內外的哲學家和學者一起參與這場盛大的哲學交流。

香港哲學研究院自從二○二四年成立以來，以「博學躬行，追求卓越」為理念，致力推動哲學交流、引導社會深入、有條理地思考問題，促進多元文化對話。研究院成立短短一年多，不僅成功創辦《香港哲學研究》雜誌，更聯合不同學術機構舉辦高質量活動，為哲學研究注入源源不絕的動力。

哲學聽起來很抽象，但其實與每個人都息息相關。哲學教我們理性地梳理複雜問題──當面對爭議時，哲學訓練我們分辨事實與觀點；遭遇困境時，哲學啓發我們多角度審視問題的本質。這種理性思考的能力，正是構建個人價值觀的基石。

更重要的是，哲學為社會凝聚共識提供重要的支撐。在價值觀日益多元的時代，哲學對話教我們用邏輯取代偏激，以同理心理解差異。通過探討倫理、權利與責任等根本問題，我們能共同尋求社會發展的平衡點，為香港建設更包容、更具前瞻性的未來奠定思想基礎。

這次論壇匯聚多位頂尖哲學家，陣容鼎盛，稍後展開的橫跨東西方哲學傳統的學術對話，相信會迸發精彩的思想火花，為哲學研究帶來新的啓示與突破。

我相信，哲學思維的培養，直接關係到批判力、道德觀與公民意識的養成。我期望香港哲學紫荊國際論壇能成為具備國際影響力的平台，為推動香港發展成為中外文化藝術中心作出貢獻。

我也希望研究院未來能吸納更多青年參與不同活動，讓哲學不只留在課室與書本，而是能走入社會，在通過學術研究、教育和文化交流，促進傳承與創新的同時，讓理性思考融入日常生活，成為社會持續進步的推動力。

最後，我祝願論壇圓滿成功，成果豐碩！謝謝大家！"
