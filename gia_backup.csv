立法會：醫務衞生局局長就「全面推展醫療融資改革，善用公私營醫療資源」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-06-12 14:55,2025-06-12 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200507.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（六月十二日）在立法會會議就「全面推展醫療融資改革，善用公私營醫療資源」議員議案的開場發言：

主席：

多謝林哲玄議員提出「全面推展醫療融資改革，善用公私營醫療資源」這項議案，以及梁熙議員、鄧家彪議員、李浩然議員及陳沛良議員提出的修正案，讓我們有機會深入討論醫療融資如何改革。

香港擁有令我們引以為傲的高質高效醫療系統，以簡單低稅制，而無須強制性的醫療保險供款，提供了達97.6%高度資助的公營醫療系統，作為全民覆蓋的安全網，確保市民不會因經濟原因無法獲得適切治療；而私營醫療系統為個別有負擔能力的市民，提供較個性化的選擇。但隨着人口老化、慢病增加、科技進步和人手短缺等引致的供求失衡，香港的醫療系統可持續性已經不單在財政方面，在質量方面也是一個考慮。醫療改革包含醫療服務、醫療藥械，以及醫療融資三方面，必須目標一致、制度配合、政策銜接。國家二十屆三中全會強調堅持深化醫療衞生體系改革，也強調要「三醫」協同發展和治理。

過去本港曾就醫療融資改革進行不少討論。早於上世紀九十年代超過四分之一世紀前，政府已委託顧問全面審視本港醫療制度，這份坊間所稱的「哈佛報告」認為香港繼續採用公共開支作為醫療開支主要支付來源，長遠難以維持。在報告發表後，政府於二○○○年發出《你我齊參與健康伴我行》諮詢文件，就醫療服務架構、質素保證及融資制度等提出改革路向，其中已構思檢討公營醫療收費制度、鼓勵市民自行作醫療投保，並探討引入個人醫療儲蓄戶口的初步槪念。

其後，政府在二○○八至二○一○年展開兩階段醫療改革公眾諮詢，深入探討六個輔助融資方案。在二○○八年《掌握健康掌握人生》第一階段公眾諮詢中，六個方案包括（一）社會醫療保障，即要求有工作的市民繳交某個部分的百分比收入，用作整體人口醫療開支；（二）用者自付費用，即提高公營醫療服務使用者須支付的收費；（三）醫療儲蓄戶口，即強制就業人士按收入比例供款並以投資回報累積，以支付自己的醫療費用；（四）自願私人醫療保險，即透過僱主提供醫療福利，以及個人購買醫療保險應付醫療開支；（五）強制私人醫療保險，即立法強制全民購買醫療保險；及（六）個人健康保險儲備，即同時融合強制醫療儲蓄及保險的計劃。

這六個輔助融資方案各有優劣，而當時社會意見紛紜，支持自願形式的構思普遍較多，而普遍對強制性質的建議有所保留，並且傾向支持風險匯集，多於個人儲蓄的方案，總體而言，市民對自願私人醫療保險的接受程度相對較高。政府因此於二○一○年進行「醫保計劃由我抉擇」第二階段公眾諮詢，集中討論這個建議，並經過與醫療衞生界、保險業界和病人組織等不同持份者磋商後，促成二○一九年推出的自願醫保計劃，提供一種受特定規範，而市場透明度高的個人償款住院保險產品，讓市民更有信心購買醫療保險，以支付醫療服務的費用。

若果大家回顧這段歷程，不難發覺超過四分之一世紀前的諮詢結果及建議內容，現時其實仍然適合，而且可以說，迫在眉睫的程度有過之而無不及，故此我們必須加快落實種種改革。根據過去十年的實際數據反映，不計及2019冠狀病毒病的相關支出，香港醫療衞生總開支佔本地生產總值的百分比從二○一二／一三年度6.1%，升至二○二二／二三年度8.4%；而公共醫療開支佔本地生產總值的百分比更由3.0%增至4.6%。

隨着本港人口急速老化，預期增長趨勢將會加劇。最新數據顯示香港長者（即65歲及以上人口）數目由二○二四年172萬人（佔總人口24%），將增至二○四六年274萬人（佔總人口36%）。根據醫院管理局（醫管局）的實際運作經驗，長者就醫療服務的使用率遠較年青族群為高。目前長者佔香港總人口約兩成四，就診人數佔普通科門診及專科門診超過三分之一，其住院日次和急症室入院人次更佔總人數約一半，故此未來醫療開支只會日益增加，現行高度依靠公帑的融資模式難以長期維持。

通過分析開支細項，可以觀察到香港醫療體系兩個結構性現象。首先是基層醫療相比第二、三層醫療這些醫院及專科服務的開支情況。醫療衞生經常性開支（根據最新二○二二／二三年度本地醫療衞生總開支帳目）達2,263億元，當中基層醫療約623億元，而第二、三層醫療約1,640億元，換言之，基層跟第二、三層的醫療開支比例大致為三比七，反映香港存在「重治療、輕預防」的情況。我們有必要以不同計劃，更好發揮家庭醫生預防、診治和管理慢性疾病的作用，減少或推遲使用費用較高昂的第二、三層醫療服務。

其次是第二、三層醫療的公私營使用分布。根據本地醫療衞生總開支帳目，在住院及日間醫療服務的經常性開支中，公營醫療體系佔比大約為三分之二，卻要應付全港近九成住院日次及日間醫療個案；而私營醫療體系開支佔比達三分之一，卻只處理約一成住院日次及日間醫療個案，這不單反映公營醫療較高的成本效益，亦反映了公私營服務出現失衡。醫療保險中預計約76.6%支出，也是用於第二、三層醫療。在公營醫療壓力日趨沉重的時候，如何更好運用醫療保險，讓「能者共付、自付」，亦是確保香港醫療體系行穩致遠的關鍵。

正如國家主席習近平所說：「健康是人民幸福生活最重要的指標」。本屆特區政府一直致力深化醫療體系改革，確保市民病有良醫。透過推動醫療、醫藥及醫保三者之間的聯動改革，提升香港醫療體系的質素、效率和可持續性。

醫療、醫藥及醫保三醫聯動應用在香港，對應的是我們在醫療服務、醫療藥械及醫療融資三個聯動領域的改革工作。在醫療服務方面，醫務衞生局公布《基層醫療健康藍圖》，積極推進基層醫療發展，加強預防性服務，達致「小病在社區」，並優化公營醫療服務，推動醫管局深化改革，提升醫療質量、安全及效益。

在醫療藥械方面，我們加快創新藥械引入速度，透過「1+」機制達致「好藥港用」，並積極籌備成立香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心，邁向「第一層審批」，以期發展香港成為國際醫療創新樞紐的同時，讓市民能及早受惠於最新科研成果。

就今日的議案辯論，重點討論醫療融資的改革工作，這方面不局限於醫療保險或其他方式支付私營服務，而是指如何保障市民使用醫療服務的財政可持續性。在公營醫療領域，政府於今年三月公布公營醫療收費改革措施，根據「承擔不減」、「能者／輕症共付」、「有加有減」、「高度資助」及「循序漸進」五大原則，加強精準資助，達致三個主要目標：（一）改革資助架構、引導善用服務；（二）減少浪費濫用，提升服務效率；（三）加強保障「貧困、急症、重病、危疾」病人，從而加固全民醫療安全網，強化公營醫療系統的可持續性，改善公私營失衡。

在私營醫療領域，我們剛在五月向衞生事務委員會簡介提高私營醫療服務收費透明度的立法建議，包括規定私營醫療機構按指定格式公布價目資料、提供服務費用預算，以及呈報及公布過往收費數據，同時提出各項長遠優化措施，讓市民在接受醫療服務前，可以掌握充分資訊作出比較，預算所需費用。醫務衞生局正由今個月起陸續會見持份者，就構思詳情進行諮詢。

至於醫療保險領域，最新數據顯示本地醫療衞生經常性開支中，私人支出佔總開支約48%，當中主要來源是住戶實付支出（佔私人支出63.1%）、私人購買的保險計劃（21.4%）和僱主提供的保險計劃（13.2%），保險作為第三方付費的角色日益重要。政府於二○一九年四月全面推行自願醫保計劃至今，保單數目按年增長，雖然受新冠疫情的影響，截至二○二四年年底，自願醫保計劃保單達142.8萬張，估計在全港個人償款住院保險市場的佔比約為三分之一。政府將繼續推廣自願醫保計劃，並與保險業界合作，以期日後可成為市場主流產品，讓病人選用醫療服務時更具保障。

主席，深化醫療體系改革，尤其是醫療融資議題，需要全社會的理解和支持。政府將秉持開放態度，聆聽各界意見。我期待各位議員稍後的發言，並會在總結發言中作出回應。謝謝。"
公務員學院舉辦首場「向世界說明中國」系列講座（附圖）,2025-06-12 14:25,2025-06-12 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200224.htm,"公務員學院推出全新的「向世界說明中國」系列講座，今日（六月十二日）舉行系列第一講，主題為「成就中華文化復興——從哪吒熱說起」，由中國文化研究院院長邱逸博士主講。

公務員學院院長郭蔭庶在講座致辭時指出，前國務院新聞辦公室主任趙啟正在其著作中提出，每個中國人都承擔着向世界說明中國的責任。當今國際形勢複雜多變，一個國家的發展，不單取決於本國國情，也受制於國際環境，包括國際輿論環境。在互聯網時代，被刻意扭曲事實和真相更容易廣泛傳播，外國民眾對中國的情況和發展普遍存在誤解和偏見，所以每位公務員都需要學習如何利用文化軟實力向世界說明中國。

本系列通過文化、科技、經濟等多維角度剖析中國的發展和挑戰，讓公務員認識國家的真實故事，裝備他們更好地發揮香港聯通國家與世界的橋樑角色，增進相互理解和推動交流合作。今日第一講「成就中華文化復興——從哪吒熱說起」，探討國家如何透過普及文化創作，向全球展現深厚的中華文化底蘊，增加中國的吸引力，進一步提升中國在國際舞台的話語權。

郭蔭庶期望學員能把握這學習機會，深入認識中國的發展模式，並肩負起人民外交的使命，在各自工作崗位上向世界展現一個真實的中國。

約340名來自52個決策局／部門的中高級公務員現場或透過網上參與今日的講座。"
"Civil Service College holds first seminar of series on ""Presenting China to the World"" (with photos)",2025-06-12 14:25,2025-06-12 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200239.htm,"  The Civil Service College (CSC) has launched a new seminar series on ""Presenting China to the World"". The first seminar of the series, on the topic of ""Achieving the Rejuvenation of Chinese Culture: Insights from the Ne Zha Craze"", was delivered today (June 12) by the Executive Director of the Academy of Chinese Studies, Dr Yau Yat.

  Addressing the seminar, the Head of the CSC, Mr Oscar Kwok, said that as Mr Zhao Qizheng, former Director of the State Council Information Office, proposed in his book, it is the joint responsibility of every Chinese national to present China to the world. Given the complex and volatile international situation nowadays, the development of a country hinges not only on its own national conditions but also on the international environment, including the international public opinion environment. In the Internet era, deliberate distortions of facts and truths are more likely to be widely disseminated, and misunderstandings and prejudices about China's situation and developments are common among foreigners. As such, every civil servant needs to learn how to present China to the world through cultural soft power.

  Through analysing China's developments and challenges from the cultural, technological, economic and other perspectives, the series enables civil servants to learn about the real stories of the country, so they can better leverage the role of Hong Kong as a bridge between the country and the world to enhance mutual understanding and to promote exchange and co-operation. The first seminar held today on ""Achieving the Rejuvenation of Chinese Culture: Insights from the Ne Zha Craze"" explored how the country showcased the rich heritage of Chinese culture to the world through popular culture, increasing China's attractiveness and further enhancing its voice on the international stage.

  Mr Kwok said he hopes that participants can seize this learning opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of China's mode of development and embrace the mission of people's diplomacy to present an authentic China to the world in their respective roles.

  Around 340 middle and senior-level civil servants from 52 bureaux and departments attended the seminar in person or online today."

Mr KS Tong (Founder and Managing Director of TKS Exhibition Services, Mr Tong Kam-shing), Dr Peter Lam (Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board), Director Zhang Dong (Director of the Asia Tourism Exchange Center of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the People's Republic of China), Mr Stanley Mok (General Manager of the Macao Government Tourism Office – Hong Kong Representative), Consuls General, friends from the trade, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning, everyone. It is my great pleasure to join you all this morning for the opening ceremony of the 39th International Travel Expo Hong Kong, or ITE in short, and the 20th MICE Travel Expo. This is my first time joining this annual event as the Secretary for Culture, Sports, and Tourism, but of course I am no stranger to the ITE. I first joined this event in 2011 as the Deputy Commissioner for Tourism, and I am so very pleased to see so many old friends, all of you are enthusiastic counterparts and stakeholders from the tourism and related sectors, as well as new friends whom may have joined the sector in the last decade or coming from afar. It is an opportune time that we all gather here in Hong Kong – our vibrant metropolis that truly shines as the capital of mega events. My very warm and heartfelt welcome for everyone.

For nearly four decades, the ITE has built and solidifies its reputation as one of the most prominent travel exhibitions in the region, presenting exciting opportunities for industry players to share, exchange and explore the latest trends and tourism offerings. This year, we are thrilled to have 500 exhibitors from some 60 countries and regions joining us. Walking through the Expo is like embarking on a whirlwind tour of the world under one roof.

The theme of the ITE this year is ""From Recovery to Development"". In line with the theme, please allow me to share some exciting updates on how Hong Kong is bouncing back and moving forward on its tourism journey. With the concerted effort of the Government and industry leaders, we witness a strong resurgence in our tourism sector post-pandemic. In 2024, Hong Kong welcomed about 45 million visitors, representing a year-on-year increase of 31 per cent. The strong rebound underscores the resilience of our tourism industry and Hong Kong's enduring appeal as a world-class travel destination. This year, we are aiming even higher, with 49 million visitors projected, a 10 per cent rise from last year. In the first five months of 2025, we have already welcomed a total of 20 million visitors, registering a 12 per cent increase over last year, putting us on track to achieve our target of a 10 per cent increase for this year.

This impressive recovery is a strong testament to Hong Kong's diverse, innovative and attractive tourism offerings. We are proud to cater to the wide-ranging preferences of our visitors. From world-class attractions and museums, to our iconic harbour, scenic outdoors, exotic islands, gastronomic diversity and excellence, and festive celebrations, Hong Kong promises an experience like no others. These days, a major highlight is our year-round mega events and happenings, which is what sets us apart from other cities. Just last weekend, the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) hosted this year's bigger, better Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races with flying colours. Signature HKTB events like Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival every October, Hong Kong New Year Countdown, and Chinese New Year Celebrations, etc., will definitely be back with new elements and enhanced excitement, so that Hong Kong will feature prominently to draw global attention. For the art and sports lovers among us, internationally renowned events such as Art Basel Hong Kong, Art Central, LIV Golf, ComplexCon making their strong presence in Hong Kong. With the opening of our new Kai Tak Sports Park, Hong Kong's largest-ever state-of-the-art sports infrastructure, in this March, our signature rugby event, Hong Kong Sevens, was staged. Building on that success, we have been hosting a series of mega international and local concerts since April, drawing over 580 000 fans, half of them from outside of Hong Kong. And the momentum continues. Just two days ago, we staged a sold-out Asian Cup qualifying football match (AFC Asian Cup 2027 Qualifiers) of Hong Kong, China vs India in the Kai Tak Stadium, and the atmosphere would make even many European stadiums shy. Our football mania will press on, with Liverpool, AC Milan, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur taking centre stage at Kai Tak Stadium in late July, followed by the eight competition events of our country's 15th National Games to be hosted right here in November.

On the business tourism front, the Government has been sparing no effort in driving the growth of MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, and Exhibitions) tourism. Since resumption of normal travel in February 2023, the Hong Kong Tourism Board has successfully secured or helped secure over 2 400 international MICE events to be held in Hong Kong, expected to bring in 570 000 high-value-added overnight MICE visitors to Hong Kong and generate a total spending of about HK$4.4 billion. Riding on this robust recovery, we will step up our efforts in bringing in even more MICE events, with a view to cementing Hong Kong's status as the region's leading MICE destination.

And we will not stop here, we are working in full steam to strengthen our traditional tourism resources on one hand, and unearth new ones, such as our beautiful islands and country parks where tourists can explore and experience Hong Kong's natural wonders, on the other. Recently, we have announced nine appealing projects to boost tourism, including the Hong Kong Industrial Brand Tourism to showcase the ""made-in-Hong Kong"" industrial tourism through guided tours to the manufactures home, city walks at the neighbourhood of Old Town Central and Kowloon City, the latter is where the hugely popular movie, ""Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In"" based on. These projects are designed to tap into the growing demand for authentic, one-of-a-kind experience, ensuring Hong Kong remains a unique must-visit destination.

Before I close, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all our industry partners for their steadfast support and contribution to our tourism recovery journey. With the collective effort of the Government, our industry and the community in concert, I am confident that we will bring our tourism industry and development to new heights in the years to come.

Once again, please accept my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to join you at the ITE again after all these years. I wish the twin expos another year of resounding success. Thank you."

Alfred (President of the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation, Mr Alfred Leung), Vice President Wang (Vice President of the Research Institute of Highway of the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China Mr Wang Shuiyin), Tony (Director of Highways, Mr Tony Yau), distinguished guests and speakers, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the inaugural International Conference on Roads and Railways - a timely and important gathering that brings together a distinguished community of policymakers, engineers, academics and industry leaders to explore the future of connectivity and sustainable mobility.

  To our guests from the Mainland and overseas, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong.

The future of roads and railways

  Roads and railways have long been the backbone of economic growth and social advancement. They are more than just physical infrastructure; they are public goods that connect people, expand opportunities, foster mutual understanding, and enable more inclusive development.

  In an era of rapid technological advancement and growing climate urgency, we are called not only to build infrastructure, but to build it smarter and greener. Transportation systems must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in ways that align with the sustainable development goals and meet the needs of future generations.

  Around the world, the momentum towards smart and sustainable mobility is accelerating. Emerging technologies, from artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, to automation and digital twin systems, are transforming how we plan and manage transport infrastructure. These innovations are helping us optimise construction engineering, enable real-time traffic management, and apply AI-powered predictive maintenance that cuts costs, reduces downtime and enhances safety.

  In short, we are seeing a profound shift from traditional infrastructure to intelligent assets that adapt, learn and improve over time.

  At the same time, the global push for decarbonisation is reshaping the transport landscape, calling for action on multiple fronts such as using low-carbon materials in construction; designing infrastructure to support green logistics; and investing in EV charging networks as critical enablers of clean transport. It also means leveraging smart technologies, such as optimising energy consumption through AI, sensor-based monitoring, modular construction, and more, to reduce emissions across the life cycle of transport assets.

  Green infrastructure, once a goal, is now a necessity.

  A key strategy in this transition is transit-oriented development, or TOD, which is a planning approach that integrates high-density urban development with efficient public transport systems. It clusters housing, commercial services and amenities around transit hubs, reducing reliance on private vehicles and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

  Studies show that well-executed TOD can reduce urban carbon emissions by up to 25 per cent, while also enhancing liveability, walkability and economic vitality. In essence, TOD is about building communities that are compact, connected and carbon-conscious.

Hong Kong's experience

  So where does Hong Kong stand in all these - and how can we contribute? I believe there are several areas that Hong Kong can share experience with our peers.

  First, technological expertise and professional excellence. Hong Kong's pathway in transport infrastructure is built on advanced engineering know-how, precision planning, and a commitment to innovation. Mable, our Secretary for Transport and Logistics, will soon provide a detailed account of how we are taking the projects forwards and how we are applying advanced technologies. But allow me to highlight a few unique features of our experience.

  Hong Kong is a compact and high-density city, where land is scarce and infrastructure must coexist with tight urban spaces. This has made us a pioneer in TOD, with railways serving as the backbone of urban development. Our railway-led planning integrates transport, housing and commercial uses to create seamlessly connected and lower-emission communities.

  A good example is the Northern Metropolis, envisioned as a major innovation and technology hub. With a projected population of 2.5 million and over 650 000 new jobs, its development will be ""infrastructure-led"" and ""capacity-creating"" - with key projects such as the Northern Metropolis Highway and the Northern Link driving connectivity and growth in the region.

  Given our dense built environment, careful planning and community engagement are essential to avoid undue disruption. While this can be time-consuming, it reminds us of the need to build infrastructure that is responsive to public aspirations and socially inclusive.

  Cross-boundary land transport infrastructure is a defining characteristic of Hong Kong. We have nine land boundary control points. From the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge to the High Speed Rail, we have experience in integrating different engineering standards, operational models and even legal frameworks. A good example is the co-location of Mainland's and Hong Kong's customs, immigration and quarantine facilities at the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station. These projects require a high degree of agility, co-ordination with our counterparts and innovation.

  Second, smart and green innovation. Hong Kong is committed to making our transport systems smarter and greener, both as an innovator of new technologies and a user of cutting-edge solutions.

  On the innovation side, we are investing heavily in four key technology areas: AI and robotics, biotech, fintech, and new energy and materials. Our goal is to become an international innovation and technology hub, with AI at its core.

  We already have a vibrant ecosystem of some 4 700 start-ups. In addition, we have been making good progress in attracting strategic enterprises to establish their presence, including R&D centres, here in Hong Kong. These include companies engaged in EVs, autonomous driving, smart traffic management and green materials, many of which are eager to seek global partners to expand their applications.

  On the application side, our high-density urban environment demands the use of advanced technologies to maintain efficiency and reliability of the transportation system. The opportunities in this space are vast, and we warmly welcome tech innovators from around the world to share solutions, co-create new applications, and shape the future of mobility together.

  Finally, financing the future. Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre gives us a unique and powerful lever to support infrastructure development globally.

  With a full suite of funding options, Hong Kong is where infrastructure projects from around the world can raise funds. This is particularly relevant for green, low-carbon infrastructure projects. We are Asia's leading green bond market, accounting for nearly half of the region's total issuance.

  And we are also pioneering innovative financing models to unlock capital for infrastructure development. One such example is securitisation of infrastructure loans, a mechanism that transforms mature, revenue-generating brownfield assets into investment products, thereby freeing up capital for new greenfield projects. To date, Hong Kong has issued two such tranches, totalling US$800 million, supporting over 50 projects across the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.

  In regions where infrastructure funding gap remains urgent and significant - particularly in the Global South - Hong Kong offers practical and scalable ways to accelerate the delivery of essential and sustainable transport networks.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, I believe the path to smarter and greener mobility is full of potential - and it is through collaboration, innovation and shared commitment that we will realise it.

  On this note, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Highways Department, and the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation for organising this meaningful conference.

  I wish the conference every success, and I look forward to the ideas and partnerships that will emerge from these three exciting days. Thank you very much."

林定國司長（律政司司長）、區志光秘書長（香港特別行政區維護國家安全委員會秘書長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家早上好。今日我很高興和大家一起參與《香港國安法》公布實施五周年專題展覽的開幕典禮，回顧特區政府如何在中央支持下，一步一步構建維護國安的屏障。

發展和安全是「車之兩輪、鳥之兩翼」。維護國家主權、安全和發展利益不單是香港特區的憲制責任，亦是每一個香港市民的應有之義。

我時常提醒大家不要忘記，過去一段長時間，香港在國家安全方面「不設防」，讓外部勢力有機可乘。從二○一二年的「反國教」，到二○一四年的非法「佔中」、二○一六年的「旺角暴動」、二○一九年的「黑暴」和港版「顏色革命」，境外勢力不斷煽風點火，甚至提供資源，破壞社會安寧，嚴重威脅特區政府的管治，市民苦不堪言。面對如此嚴峻的局面，中央果斷出手，《香港國安法》於二○二○年六月三十日在香港頒布實施，填補了香港特區在維護國安法律制度和執行機制方面的短板。

不過，我們必須緊記，之前亂象是香港歷史上永遠抹不去的傷疤。敵對勢力仍然死心不息，不斷尋找機會危害我們國家和特區的安全。我們要時刻警惕的風險包括：

（一）外部敵對勢力仍通過抹黑和所謂的「制裁」妄圖危害我們的國家安全；
（二）潛逃海外的反中亂港分子，繼續從事危害國家安全的活動和行為，包括繼續宣揚港獨；
（三）本土恐怖主義；以及
（四）軟對抗，一些別有用心的人利用假新聞、假消息不停去分化社會和煽動仇恨。

因此，我們不能夠鬆懈麻痺，自《香港國安法》生效以來，特區政府做了大量工作，包括加強執法力度。截至二○二五年六月一日，所有相關法律下涉及危害國安的案件中，共326人被捕；其中165人已被定罪。國家安全得來不易，特區政府會繼續用好法律，緊守維護國家安全的重責。

更重要的是，我們需要全體市民支持。當每一個市民都慎思明辨，共同努力就能築牢國家安全的屏障。只要每位香港市民多行一步，例如一旦發現可能危害國安的情況，就向警務處國安處熱線舉報，電話是6271 7171。截至今年六月一日，得到市民配合下，已收到超過92萬條相關信息，效果令人鼓舞。

今日的專題展覽是一個很好的平台，讓市民了解《香港國安法》的原則、保障、實施情況和必要性，了解其如何更好保障市民的權利和自由，令我們有更充足的底氣，在安全的環境下推動高質量發展。

最後，我謹祝展覽圓滿成功，亦祝在座各位身體健康。多謝大家。"

更重要的是，我們需要全體市民支持。當每一個市民都慎思明辨，共同努力就能築牢國家安全的屏障。只要每位香港市民多行一步，例如一旦發現可能危害國安的情況，就向警務處國安處熱線舉報，電話是6271 7171。截至今年六月一日，得到市民配合下，已收到超過92萬條相關信息，效果令人鼓舞。

今日的專題展覽是一個很好的平台，讓市民了解《香港國安法》的原則、保障、實施情況和必要性，了解其如何更好保障市民的權利和自由，令我們有更充足的底氣，在安全的環境下推動高質量發展。

最後，我謹祝展覽圓滿成功，亦祝在座各位身體健康。多謝大家。"

林定國司長（律政司司長）、區志光秘書長（香港特別行政區維護國家安全委員會秘書長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家早上好。今日我很高興和大家一起參與《香港國安法》公布實施五周年專題展覽的開幕典禮，回顧特區政府如何在中央支持下，一步一步構建維護國安的屏障。

發展和安全是「車之兩輪、鳥之兩翼」。維護國家主權、安全和發展利益不單是香港特區的憲制責任，亦是每一個香港市民的應有之義。

我時常提醒大家不要忘記，過去一段長時間，香港在國家安全方面「不設防」，讓外部勢力有機可乘。從二○一二年的「反國教」，到二○一四年的非法「佔中」、二○一六年的「旺角暴動」、二○一九年的「黑暴」和港版「顏色革命」，境外勢力不斷煽風點火，甚至提供資源，破壞社會安寧，嚴重威脅特區政府的管治，市民苦不堪言。面對如此嚴峻的局面，中央果斷出手，《香港國安法》於二○二○年六月三十日在香港頒布實施，填補了香港特區在維護國安法律制度和執行機制方面的短板。

不過，我們必須緊記，之前亂象是香港歷史上永遠抹不去的傷疤。敵對勢力仍然死心不息，不斷尋找機會危害我們國家和特區的安全。我們要時刻警惕的風險包括：

（一）外部敵對勢力仍通過抹黑和所謂的「制裁」妄圖危害我們的國家安全；
（二）潛逃海外的反中亂港分子，繼續從事危害國家安全的活動和行為，包括繼續宣揚港獨；
（三）本土恐怖主義；以及
（四）軟對抗，一些別有用心的人利用假新聞、假消息不停去分化社會和煽動仇恨。

因此，我們不能夠鬆懈麻痺，自《香港國安法》生效以來，特區政府做了大量工作，包括加強執法力度。截至二○二五年六月一日，所有相關法律下涉及危害國安的案件中，共326人被捕；其中165人已被定罪。國家安全得來不易，特區政府會繼續用好法律，緊守維護國家安全的重責。

更重要的是，我們需要全體市民支持。當每一個市民都慎思明辨，共同努力就能築牢國家安全的屏障。只要每位香港市民多行一步，例如一旦發現可能危害國安的情況，就向警務處國安處熱線舉報，電話是6271 7171。截至今年六月一日，得到市民配合下，已收到超過92萬條相關信息，效果令人鼓舞。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早晨。我十分高興出席《香港國安法》公布實施五周年專題展覽開幕典禮。我希望藉今天機會，重申我之前提及過的三個「不能」和一個「堅持」。

第一個「不能」是不能忘記歷史——中國人的傳統教訓是「前事不忘，後事之師」。我們大家都必然記得二○一九年爆發的「修例風波」，不但國家安全受到嚴重威脅，我們誤以為是理所當然的和平安定社會環境受到巨大破壞，大家不能夠正常學習、工作和生活。我們都感受到切膚之痛，亦令我們深刻認識沒有國家安全，大家都無法真正行使我們都十分珍惜的權利和自由，人身安全、財產也會受到威脅，亦無法過正常生活。我們要謹記這個慘痛的教訓，時刻提醒自己絕對不可以讓歷史重演。

第二個「不能」是不能無視現實——中國人的傳統智慧是居安思危，不可對問題視而不見、聽而不聞。雖然香港社會已回復安定，而國安風險亦往往非肉眼能容易所見，但事實擺在眼前，敵對國家和勢力正企圖不斷打壓我們國家的發展。正正因為香港在「一國兩制」下，在國家發展中扮演着獨特及不可取代的地位，亦是現時國家內最自由開放的地方，自然成為攻擊的目標。某國家企圖通過非法制裁手段和威脅干擾國安案件的正當司法程序、對香港這個零關稅的獨立關稅區實施非法關稅，就是最鮮明的例子。

第三個「不能」是不能袖手旁觀——中國人講究的是凡事要身體力行，不可光說不做。既然國家安全與我們個人福祉息息相關，那麼自然地，我們亦應肩負相應維護國家安全的責任。《香港國安法》第六條清楚指明，維護國家主權、統一和領土完整是包括香港同胞在內的全中國人民的共同義務；在香港的任何機構、組織和個人都應當遵守《香港國安法》和有關維護國家安全的其他法律，不得從事危害國家安全的行為和活動。

在以上三個「不能」的大前提下，我們必須有一個「堅持」，就是堅持按照法治原則維護國家安全。這原則是《香港國安法》第五條明文所規定。優良法治當然是香港賴以成功的基石，是香港能成為國際金融、貿易、航運中心的先決條件。堅持按法治原則維護國家安全，對確保和促進安全和發展這對關係的良性互動至為關鍵。

我非常高興看到這次專題展覽以現代創新生動方式，不偏不倚、深入淺出，向參觀者展示維護國家安全的重要性、香港特區的憲制責任、「修例風波」的歷史真相、中央制定《香港國安法》，以及維護國家安全法律發揮的作用和成效等。我期望通過這次專題展覽，讓大家更了解及明白為何我提出的三個「不能」和一個「堅持」。

最後，我預祝這次展覽取得圓滿成功。謝謝大家。"

行政長官出席紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年國際學術研討會致辭（只有中文）,2025-06-12 10:11,2025-06-12 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061200283.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（六月十二日）出席紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年國際學術研討會的致辭：

尊敬的高翔院長（中國社會科學院、中國歷史研究院院長）、王松苗秘書長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室秘書長）、王祥明董事長（華潤集團董事長）、許正中董事長（紫荊文化集團董事長）、黃平院長（香港中國學術研究院院長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好。今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年。我首先歡迎中國社會科學院、中國歷史研究院高翔院長率團來到香港，也感謝主辦機構籌備這次研討會，讓我們一同銘記歷史、緬懷先烈。珍愛和平，開創未來。

中國人民在抗日戰爭勝利，是民族愛國精神的偉大勝利。在長達14年的艱苦抗戰中，我們的先烈砥礪奮鬥，以強大的民族意識和愛國精神，激勵並推動着全國人民義無反顧地團結抵抗外敵，保衞家國。

今天的研討會在香港舉辦，意義重大，除了引領香港市民紀念這段可歌可泣的歷史，更提醒我們香港在抗日戰爭和反法西斯戰爭中的重要角色。

香港作為自由港已有接近兩百年歷史，更一直擔當獨一無二的中外交通樞紐。在抗戰時，香港眾志成城，成為向祖國和盟軍運送物資的重要渠道和交通動脈，積極投身抗戰前線，守護國家。

當時香港的民眾和僑胞聚沙成塔，在物資上全力支援祖國抗日，很多更投身民間抗日組織，例如家傳戶曉的東江縱隊和港九大隊等。這些由平民組成的游擊隊，雖然軍備不足、資源有限，但每位隊員都奮勇抗敵，除了保護平民和海上航道，更多次營救受困的文化人士、盟軍成員等，縱然在香港淪陷後，依然堅持進行反攻作戰，在抗戰期間展現堅毅不屈的家國情操。

香港市民與祖國同胞血濃於水，在國難之時，更是團結一致，奮力抗敵，保家衞國。經過了艱苦卓絕的鬥爭，中國人民在抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭中取得了偉大勝利，開闢了中華民族偉大復興的光明前景。

抗戰勝利距今已經80年，我們之中的大部分人沒有親身經歷戰爭的洗禮，成長於國家發展蒸蒸日上、走向更強盛的年代，但我們和下一代必須銘記先烈為中華民族以至世界和平的犧牲和不屈不撓的精神，時刻牢記今天國家和諧穩定、繁榮昌盛的得來不易，高度警惕任何美化侵略主義和分裂國家的思想言論。

為了紀念抗戰勝利80周年，香港將舉辦一連串的活動，提升全社會的愛國精神。「愛國主義教育工作小組」正統籌特區政府各相關政策局及部門開展籌備工作，包括官方紀念儀式、多個大型主題展覽、抗戰電影放映會、優化具抗戰歷史意義的旅遊配套等形式的多樣活動。

特區政府一直在社會建立以愛國愛港為核心、同「一國兩制」方針相適應的主流價值觀，推動社會各界和愛國愛港團體，積極組織不同的紀念活動，豐富市民的愛國主義教育體驗，進一步強化青年對國家的歸屬感。

我們要以史為鑑，珍愛和平，延續先輩的家國情懷和民族精神，傳承他們對國家、民族強盛的渴望，繼續團結一致，為中華民族復興偉業，作出更大貢獻。

我相信接下來研討會對這段偉大歷史的深入討論，將為各位帶來新的啓發和思考。我預祝研討會圓滿成功，祝願國家國泰民安，在座各位平安幸福。謝謝大家。"

DSD implements flood prevention measures to cope with Tropical Storm Wutip (with photos),2025-06-12 00:15,2025-06-12 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/12/P2025061101095.htm,"âIn light of the approaching Tropical Storm Wutip, the Director of Drainage Services, Mr Ringo Mok, held a meeting on June 11 with the senior management team of the department, followed by inspections of locations that had been hit by severe flooding in the past, such as Chai Wan, Heng Fa Chuen, and Wong Tai Sin, to learn about the implementation of flood prevention measures.

Mr Mok and the senior management team inspected several locations respectively, including the modular pumping system at Chai Wan Road roundabout, the installation of demountable flood barriers at Heng Fa Chuen, the divider holds at Lung Cheung Road carriageway in Wong Tai Sin, manhole covers, and the Pilot Scheme on Wading Line System. He also inspected the powerful pumping robots, Mobile Powerful Pumping Robot and Amphibious Pumping Robot, to ensure their readiness for operation.

As the Tropical Storm Wutip came within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong, the Drainage Services Department (DSD) initiated early preparation for low-lying or exposed coastal areas, such as Tai O and Lei Yue Mun. The measures include inspecting drainage channels, installing demountable flood barriers, setting up temporary water pumps, providing and placing sandbags, and constructing temporary pedestrian walkways. The DSD will maintain close liaison with the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and closely monitor the flooding situation.

Earlier in March this year, the DSD conducted a drill in full spectrum before the rainy season and further enhanced the response capacity of the Emergency Control Centre (ECC). During extreme weather, the number of emergency response teams will increase from 160 last year to approximately 180, with over 30 emergency operation stations in Hong Kong, to conduct inspections and clearance of drainage channels across the territory. The DSD will continue to implement the ""just-in-time clearance"" measures, deploying staff immediately upon receiving rainstorm warnings from the HKO to inspect and clear 240 drainage points in Hong Kong which are prone to blockages.

When the HKO issues a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, a special announcement on Flooding in the northern New Territories, the Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement or Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or above, the DSD's ECC will come into operation immediately to handle and coordinate emergency flooding incidents in Hong Kong.

The DSD reminds members of the public to complete precautionary measures for coping with typhoon and flooding as soon as possible, keep the drains clear at all times and avoid blockage of drainage intakes. In the event of serious flooding, they should evacuate immediately. The DSD urges the public to immediately call the 24-hour Drainage Hotline at 2300 1110 in case of flooding."

主席：

我現在提出政府的修正案，修正《2025年房屋（修訂）條例草案》的詳題、第5（1）條、第8條及第14條。有關修正案充分考慮及反映了法案委員會的建議，並且獲得法案委員會的支持。修正案的內容已載於分發給各位委員的檔案。

就《條例草案》的詳題，因應法案委員會的意見，我們對行文作出輕微的修訂，令詳題更清晰、簡潔。

就第5（1）條的修訂，因應有議員的意見，我們在第25（3A）條中列明第25（4）條只適用於根據《房屋條例》第16（1）條出租作住宅用途的土地的租戶，以加強有關條文的清晰度。

就第8條的修訂，在法案委員會上，有議員建議我們參考《稅務條例》（第112章）的用字，以「經營 （carrying on）」取代「為了…目的（for purposes relating to）」。因應議員的意見，我們對相應的條文作出修訂。如租戶在租住單位經營任何貿易或業務，或容許其他人在租住單位內經營任何貿易或業務，而該租戶或其家庭的已登記戶籍的家庭成員又不居住於有關單位，即屬違法。

最後，就第14條的修訂，為理順繳付定額罰款通知書及繳款通知書的程序，我們以《2024年電子執行交通法例（雜項修訂）條例》（2024年第13號條例）為藍本，對《條例草案》的有關條文作出修訂。經修訂後，繳交罰款的人除可交付通知書外，亦可提供通知書上載列的通知書編號或電子繳款號碼，並根據定額罰款通知書或繳款通知書上的繳款指示繳交罰款。

法案委員會對上述修正案並無異議。我請各位委員支持有關修正案。多謝主席。"

首先我想衷心感謝《2025年房屋（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）的委員會主席陳健波議員、副主席洪雯議員、其他委員及立法會秘書處人員的努力，令《條例草案》的審議工作能夠順利完成，並於今日恢復二讀辯論。我亦感謝剛才發言的多位議員支持《條例草案》，加強阻嚇力，讓我們珍貴的公屋資源可以好好地利用，亦提出很多寶貴意見，讓我們日後執行時可以留意，特別在情理兼備上給了很多例子，去小心處理；亦提議我們日後執法時，是否繼續加強和其他部門的協作、與內地機構單位取得一些有用的資料，以及利用資訊科技等去做好一些偵測的工作。

社會已經形成強烈共識，剛才很多議員發言，都有這個看法。公共房屋資源很珍貴，必須好好利用，交予有需要的市民手上。畢竟今天，仍然有很多市民在劏房等惡劣的環境，需要公屋。今屆政府上任以來通過一系列加強打擊濫用公共租住房屋的措施，成績大家都看得到，獲得社會各界的肯定。香港房屋委員會（房委會）由今屆政府開始，即二○二二年七月開始，至（今年）三月底，收回約8 200個被濫用或違反租約的公屋單位，有議員都類比，等於一個何文田邨般大的屋邨，替政府節省的資源是八十二億元或以上，因為還有很多的道路和配套設施等，所以這項工作很重要，亦必須繼續做。

正如我在動議二讀時指出，《條例草案》的主要目標是使打擊濫用公共房屋的措施更具阻嚇力，從而令居民及相關人士不會以身試法。但我強調，正常在公屋居住、正常使用或者鄰里間的一些很溫情的、常情常理的表現、互相幫助，或者剛才有議員說，其實今天的公屋（居民），仍有互相借雞蛋、豉油等行為，這些溫情的行為，或是間中幫助鄰家的長者，或者幫助鄰家的小孩補習等，而不是利用公屋進行商業、貿易行為。或者在現今社會，有很多新的工作模式：在家工作，或者在網上處理事項等，但他不是在公屋單位內交收，公屋不會變成貨倉，或者不會變成很多陌生人經常出入公屋取貨、付款等，這些不是嚴重濫用公屋的行為。我們針對的是一些自己本身不在單位居住，但卻用來作牟利的行為，這些就是我們這次《條例草案》要去打擊的。

亦有議員說，我們處理一些濫用或者違反公屋租約時，我們有一個上訴機制，是否上訴機制好像沒有成功個案？不是的，其實我們看一些數字，上訴機制是有效，上訴成功（率）維持在百分之二十至三十。有一些是修訂原先的建議，大概也有百分之二十至三十，證明上訴機制是運作良好，我們都會看一些客觀數據。

我們的濫用公屋獎（「舉報濫用公屋獎」），正正就是有一些左鄰右里，騷擾一些良好的公屋居民。我聽過有婆婆說，鄰家經常有些很兇惡的人出入，她很害怕，如果願意舉報，其實是保護一些需要幫助的鄰居。

除了把嚴重濫用公屋變成罪行、賦權獲授權人員在指定情況下要求相關人士提供個人資料外，《條例草案》亦建議延長虛假陳述、拒絕提供資料及非法讓與罪行的檢控時效。《條例草案》的內容與社會意見是一致的，同時亦反映今屆政府的決心、魄力，從根本解決這個大家都覺得一定要大力處理的問題。過去如果一些虛假陳述的個案，事實上刑罰也是重的，有些個案是監禁了30天，或者兩星期，所以真的要大家市民留意，不要違反這些條例。

此外，就《房屋（交通違例事項）（定額罰款）附例》（《第283C章》）的技術性修訂亦讓我們在打擊屋邨範圍內非法使用道路方面更能靈活變通。

總體而言，法案委員會委員均支持《條例草案》，並認同應盡快完成法例的修訂工作。就《條例草案》的草擬，委員亦提出了很多具建設性的建議。經審慎考慮，我們採納委員的部分建議，並提出相關修正條文。我會稍後在全體委員會審議階段提出修正案時再作介紹。

立法時間表方面，《第283C章》的技術性修訂將於法例刊憲當日起實施。就《條例草案》的其他內容（即把嚴重濫用公屋變成罪行、賦權獲授權人員在執行職務時，可要求侵入者或可疑人士提供個人資料及延長虛假陳述、拒絕提供資料及非法讓與罪行的檢控時效）將於明年三月三十一日起實施。《條例草案》分兩個階段實施，讓我們有充足的時間向前線人員提供足夠的指引及培訓，以確保運作暢順，並進行廣泛的公眾教育，以釋除擔心有人會誤墮法網等的疑慮。

如獲立法會三讀通過《條例草案》，正如我上述所言，我們會加大力度宣傳，包括派發宣傳單張到租戶的信箱、在屋邨大堂張貼海報、製作一些簡單易明的懶人包、宣傳短片，亦很多謝剛才有議員提議我們拍一些處境短劇，這些都令市民很容易吸收明白，電子海報或是一些文字訊息，以及透過房委會和房屋署網站、巴士、鐵路廣告等，將訊息廣泛地傳遞給公眾及公屋租戶。

我們亦都明白要加強我們前線人員的培訓，剛才有議員發言提及有些個案講及我們前線人員，對一些申請公屋的朋友，有點不禮貌的對待。我聽到其實很心痛，亦請相關的議員在會後可以將有關的詳細資料交給我，我們一定會嚴肅地跟進處理。這些個案亦提醒了我們，其實房委會每一位同事都很重要，都是市民對我們很深刻的印象，所以每一個同事都必須要抱着關懷、耐心和專業的態度，去對待每一名他們接觸到的市民。我們亦希望跟社會的持份者保持溝通。

剛才的討論亦有提及房屋階梯，見到我們打濫有成效，階梯亦有一個流動性，往後我們都會努力地繼續研究，去完善我們的房屋階梯。大家亦有提及上進、上流，這都是房屋局、房屋署全體心中的一個目標，我希望在下一個階段更多跟大家探討，希望大家一起出謀獻策，令到我們這個階梯活起來。

剛才有議員說其實公屋居民住了一段時間，都很想買居屋。以往出現的情況，可能大家都記得，二○○四年開始有十年是沒有居屋銷售。現在的情況很不同，由現在開始，未來五年，房委會共有四萬五千個居屋單位推出，加上房協（香港房屋協會）可能再有多一萬個。所以居屋絕對是上進、上流的一個選擇，將來社會討論多點，令公屋居民或年輕家庭，以資助出售房屋的置業為一個起步點，我想大家可以一起多點探討和談論。

最後，我懇請議員支持通過《條例草案》。多謝主席，我謹此陳辭。"
HKSAR Government opposes slanderous remarks by foreign countries and anti-China organisations on case of Joshua Wong Chi-fung,2025-06-11 21:51,2025-06-11 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061101007.htm,"âThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (June 11) strongly condemned and opposed some Western countries, anti-China organisations and anti-China politicians, etc., for making erroneous slanders and smears on the case of Joshua Wong Chi-fung involving the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the HKSAR's work on safeguarding national security, totally disregarding the spirit of the rule of law.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""As the legal proceedings of the case involving Joshua Wong Chi-fung are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the case. The HKSAR Government strongly urges these Western countries, anti-China organisations and anti-China politicians to immediately stop interfering in the HKSAR's internal affairs and the independent exercise of judicial power by the courts of the HKSAR.

""The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation. The Department of Justice of the HKSAR is in charge of criminal prosecutions under Article 63 of the Basic Law, with all its prosecutorial decisions made on an objective analysis of all admissible evidence and applicable laws.

""The Judiciary of the HKSAR exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence will receive fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong (including the HKNSL) and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or backgrounds of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.

""Any attempt by any country, organisation, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power, thereby resulting in a defendant not being able to have a fair trial that one should receive, is a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR and should be condemned.

""We are appalled by irresponsible remarks of some countries, organisations or individuals that seemed to suggest that people with certain political beliefs should be immune to legal sanctions, or even call for release of suspects who have been arrested by the HKSAR law enforcement agencies in accordance with the law.

""The HKSAR Government will, as always, resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the HKNSL, the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, whilst upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'."""

特區政府發言人表示︰「由於黃之鋒所涉及案件的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不應評論有關案件。特區政府強烈敦促美西方國家、反華組織、反華政客等立即停止干預特區的內部事務和特區法院獨立行使的審判權。」

「香港特區司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，而所有面對刑事指控的人均嚴格按照香港適用法律（包括《香港國安法》），並在《基本法》及《香港人權法案》的保障下，享有接受公平審訊的權利。法院嚴格按照證據和所有適用法律判案，案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同；而控方有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人犯罪，被告人才可被法庭定罪。」

「任何國家、組織或個人企圖利用政治力量干預香港特區的司法程序，以促使任何被告人不能獲得應有的公平審訊，都是破壞香港特區法治的行為，應受譴責。」

「對於有國家、組織或個人似乎作出持某種政治理念的人應不受法律制裁的不負責任的言論，甚至要求立即釋放被特區執法部門依法拘捕的疑犯，我們感到震驚。」

「特區政府會一如既往堅定不移、全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。」"

尊敬的徐念沙會長（中國機械工業聯合會會長）、鍾志華院士（中國工程院院士）、盧文端主席（第十屆中國僑聯副主席、中國港澳臺僑和平發展總會會長、香港國際汽車及供應鏈博覽會組委會榮譽主席）、付丙鋒副會長（香港國際汽車及供應鏈博覽會組委會主席、中國汽車工業協會常務副會長兼秘書長）、盧金榮會長（全國政協委員、香港中華廠商會聯合會會長、香港國際汽車及供應鏈博覽會組委會首席主席）、孫東局長（創新科技及工業局局長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家晚上好。很高興出席今天的交流晚宴。今晚，我們相聚在香港這座充滿活力與創意的城市，共同迎接明天開幕的2025國際汽車及供應鏈博覽會。首先，我感謝主辦機構組織這個盛會，也向各位嘉賓，特別是從各地到來的朋友們表示最熱烈的歡迎！

今次的博覽會不僅是一場汽車行業的盛會，更是首次在香港舉辦，象徵國家汽車產業升級與香港深度結合的新機遇。事實上，全球對新能源汽車的需求不斷上升，根據國際能源署的資料，去年全球電動汽車銷量超過1700萬輛，預計今年將突破2000萬輛，佔新車總銷量超過四分之一。

我國是新能源汽車的領航者，也是出口大國，從電池製造到系統整合，從自動駕駛到乘坐體驗，多個品牌都在國際上引領潮流，可以說是亮點紛呈。今年首4個月，中國新能源汽車出口超過64萬輛，同比增長53%，出口市場覆蓋全球超過170個國家及地區，成績斐然。

香港作為聯通內地與國際的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，一直以來都是內地企業走向國際市場的重要門戶。在「一國兩制」的獨特優勢下，我們絕對有條件成為中國車企及產業鏈出海的「落腳點、橋頭堡、充電站、推進器」。其中有兩點香港的貢獻尤其獨特。

第一，是以金融支持內地新汽車工業的全球佈局。汽車工業涉及的上、中、下游企業數以千計，它們需要資金持續推動科研、創新和發展。香港擁有蓬勃和全鏈條的籌融資市場和高質量的金融服務，從天使基金、風投創投到私募資金以及上市證券市場，都能連接全球的資金和投資者，為不同範疇的企業提供所需的金融支持。上月寧德時代在香港上市，成為了今年以來全球最大的IPO（首次公開招股），它所籌得的資金約九成用於匈牙利廠房的建設，是「香港集資以支持國際拓展」這模式的示範。無懼當前的地緣政治環境，國際投資者對中國創科企業的興趣和憧憬，讓更多國際資金來到香港，尋求投資項目。我相信跟汽車產業鏈和供應鏈相關的企業，能更容易找到好的投資者。此外，香港在「一國兩制」下「內聯外通」的獨特優勢，對國際法規和習慣的熟悉，以及遍佈全球的網絡，能夠助力內地企業出海、走進國際市場。我鼓勵大家在香港設立國際業務總部、供應鏈管理中心和財資中心等。

第二，香港正全力推動創科發展成為香港經濟的新引擎，並與粵港澳大灣區的兄弟城市聯動，成為涵蓋研發、商業化到先進製造等功能全面的國際創科中心。其中，香港標準與國際高度接軌、保障知識產權制度完善、匯聚內地和國際數據和人才等優點，都讓新能源汽車、智慧交通、車聯網等產業有更廣闊的試驗空間和應用場景。事實上，多家在這領域的企業已經落戶香港，並成為我們重要的合作夥伴。不少它們上下游的企業也已到了香港，成立研發和人才培訓基地。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，汽車產業的未來發展離不開全球化的視野和資源整合。儘管當前全球面對保護主義和關稅戰，但國際間持續推動綠色轉型，加上新興市場的快速擴張，以及我國新能源汽車的競爭力，我相信整個產業正在迎來新的發展藍海。我們熱烈歡迎各位善用香港的優勢，一起共建汽車產業出海與全球合作的新高地，為全球的綠水青山、為各地人民更美好的生活作出更大的貢獻！

最後，我祝大家有個愉快的晚上，並祝願本次博覽會圓滿成功、成果豐碩，各位嘉賓朋友身體健康、事業宏達。謝謝大家。"
LCQ21: Safeguarding mental health of academic staff members and students,2025-06-11 18:56,2025-06-11 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100304.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lillian Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

  The mental health of academic staff members and students in Hong Kong draws societal concern. There are views that the Government should strengthen the protection of their physical and mental health as well as to provide appropriate support services to the families of suicide victims concerned. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of academic staff members and students committing suicide and attempting to commit suicide in each of the past five years and, among them, the numbers of cases in which death inquests were held, together with a breakdown by types of school (i.e. (i) primary school, (ii) secondary school and (iii) university);

(2) of the Government's follow-up and support procedures in respect of cases of suicide attempts among academic staff members and students, including the policy bureaux involved, the category of professionals providing support services in those cases and the areas and extent of intervention, as well as details of the support services provided by them; and

(3) in respect of the suicide cases mentioned in (1), whether the Government has provided support services (e.g. professional emotional counselling services) to the families, relatives and friends of the suicide victims; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; primarily which government departments' staff members to provide assistance to the families of suicide victims and inform them of their rights under the law (including the rights of the families to request for holding a death inquest)?

Reply:

President,

  The Education Bureau (EDB) attaches great importance to the mental health of teachers and students, and has all along been encouraging schools to adopt the Whole School Approach. Through cross-departmental, cross-disciplinary and cross-sector collaboration, the EDB enhances the mental health of teachers and students and provides enhanced support for students with mental health needs (including those with suicidal risk) via various measures and activities directed at three levels, namely Universal, Selective and Indicated. In recent years, the EDB has implemented a number of measures to support students' mental health. This includes implementing the ""4Rs Mental Health Charter"" in the 2024/25 school year, with a view to helping students develop healthy living habits and positive interpersonal relationships, and enhancing their resilience. In addition, starting from the 2023/24 school year, the EDB has launched the Mental Health Literacy Resource Packages suitable for students at different learning stages. In consultation with the Social Welfare Department (SWD), our reply to the question raised by the Hon Lillian Kwok is as follows:

(1) and (2) The EDB has all along required primary and secondary schools to report fatal suspected student suicide cases. The numbers of relevant cases in primary and secondary schools in the past five years (2020 to 2024) are tabulated as follows. Of the cases reported, secondary students accounted for about 91 per cent of the total cases, while primary students accounted for about 9 per cent.

Number of cases


2020
21


2021

  The EDB does not collect data on fatal suspected suicide cases of school personnel, attempted suicides of students, relevant cases of university students and number of death inquests held.

  We continue to strengthen the identification of and support for students with mental health risks. For example, the EDB organises about 40 additional thematic teacher training workshops in the 2024/25 school year to introduce the practical skills, counselling techniques and intervention strategies in supporting students with mental health needs, as well as organises parent education talk series for parents of primary and secondary school students that cover topics related to the mental health of children.

  Regarding support measures, if schools suspect the students having suicidal risk, schools will arrange school guidance personnel (for example, student guidance teacher/student guidance personnel or school social worker) for early support. If necessary, schools will solicit professional support from the school-based educational psychologists, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, medical, or police officers to ensure that appropriate intervention measures will be taken. To enhance cross-sector collaboration, starting from December 2023, the Government has implemented the Three-tier School-based Emergency Mechanism in all secondary schools in Hong Kong by pooling together the schools' multi-disciplinary teams, the off-campus support network and medical services. The implementation of the Mechanism has been extended till the end of 2025 and related arrangements were enhanced.

  Furthermore, the Government established a cross-departmental referral and collaboration mechanism in April 2024. For instance, when police officers handle attempted suicide cases concerning primary and secondary students that happen outside schools, the Police will, upon obtaining the consent from the student concerned and the parent/guardian, refer the case to the school the student is attending, via the EDB, for support services. If the student and parent/guardian wish to receive support services from other organisation(s), the SWD will refer the case for services provided by other social services units, such as Integrated Family Service Centres (IFSCs), Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness, and Integrated Children and Youth Services Centres. Schools or relevant social welfare organisations will provide students with emergency intervention services, such as assessments, support and counselling through individual, group or online mode.

  Regarding support for teachers' physical and psychological well-being, the EDB has set up the Teachers' Helpline since 2006 to support teachers in coping with stress at work and mental health problems. Apart from this, professional counselling services and face-to-face counselling will be provided as and when necessary, and professionals will be arranged to follow up relevant cases. Meanwhile, the service providers will organise talks on how to relieve stress for teachers. In addition, starting from the 2023/24 school year, the EDB has commissioned non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or tertiary institutions to organise courses on physical and mental health for teachers every year, covering topics on mental health, expressive arts, mindfulness and physical health, to enhance teachers' capacity at work.

(3) The SWD subvents The Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong to operate the Suicide Crisis Intervention Centre (SCIC), which offers immediate crisis intervention and in-depth counselling services for persons in need.The SCIC also renders support services to persons affected by suicidal behaviours (including familes and friends), including consultation hotline, groups, talks and workshops. Moreover, 67 territory-wide IFSCs (including two Integrated Service Centres), operated by the SWD or subvented NGOs also provide appropriate service and assistance for the families and relatives of suicide victims, including financial assistance, counselling service, and connection with community resources."
立法會二十一題︰保障教職員及學生的精神健康,2025-06-11 18:56,2025-06-11 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100302.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上郭玲麗議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆：

問題：

本港教職員及學生的精神健康情況備受社會關注。有意見認為，政府應加強保障他們的身心健康，也須為有關自殺者的家屬提供適切的支援服務。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年教職員及學童的自殺及企圖自殺的數目，以及當中有展開死因研訊的個案數目，並按學校類別（即（i）‍小學、（ii）中學及（iii）大學）列出分項數字；

（二）就教職員及學童企圖自殺的個案，政府的跟進及支援程序為何，包括涉及哪些政策局、其中提供支援服務的專業人士類別及介入的範疇及程度，以及其提供的支援服務詳情；及

（三）就第（一）項所述的自殺個案，政府有否為自殺者的家屬和親友提供支援服務（例如專業的情緒輔導服務）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；主要由哪些政府部門的人員向自殺者家屬提供協助，並告知其在法律上的權利（包括家屬可以要求召開死因研訊的權利）？

答覆：

主席：

教育局十分重視教師及學生的精神健康，一直鼓勵學校採用全校參與模式，透過跨部門、跨專業及跨界別合作，在「普及性」、「選擇性」、「針對性」三個層面，透過不同措施和活動，促進師生的精神健康，以及加強支援有精神健康需要（包括有自殺風險）的學生。近年，教育局推展多項支援學生精神健康措施，包括於二○二四／二五學年推行《4Rs精神健康約章》，協助學生建立健康的生活習慣和正面的人際關係，加強他們的抗逆力。此外，教育局於二○二三／二四學年起推出不同學習階段《精神健康素養資源套》。就郭玲麗議員提出的問題，經諮詢社會福利署（社署），現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）教育局一直要求中、小學匯報學生懷疑自殺身亡個案。過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）中、小學有關個案數目表列如下，當中中學生約佔總個案數目的百分之九十一，小學生則約佔百分之九。

教育局沒有收集教職員懷疑自殺身亡個案、學生企圖自殺個案、大學生的相關個案，以及有召開死因研訊的個案數目。

我們持續加強識別和支援有精神健康風險的學生，例如於二○二四／二五學年增辦約40個主題式的教師培訓工作坊，介紹支援有精神健康需要的學生的實用技巧、輔導方法和介入策略，以及為小學及中學學生家長舉辦家長教育講座系列，內容涵蓋有關子女精神健康的主題。

支援措施方面，若學校懷疑學生有自殺危機，學校會安排學校輔導人員（如學生輔導教師／學生輔導人員／學校社工）及早支援。如有需要，學校會尋求校本教育心理學家、臨床心理學家、精神科醫生、醫護或警務人員的專業支援，確保能採取適當的介入措施。為加強跨界別合作，政府於二○二三年十二月開始，在全港中學推行以學校為本的「三層應急機制」，結合校內的跨專業團隊、校外支援網絡和醫療服務。該機制的實施已延長至二○二五年底，並優化有關安排。

此外，政府於二○二四年四月設立跨部門轉介及協作機制。例如當警務人員處理在學校以外發生涉及中、小學學生的企圖自殺個案時，在獲取有關學生及家長／監護人的同意後，會透過教育局轉介個案至其現正就讀的學校接受支援服務。如學生及家長／監護人希望接受其他機構提供的支援服務，個案將由社署轉介至其他社會服務單位接受服務，例如綜合家庭服務中心、精神健康綜合社區中心及綜合青少年服務中心。學校或相關社會福利機構會透過個人、小組或線上形式，為學生提供評估、支援和輔導等應急介入服務。

在支援教師身心健康方面，教育局自二○○六年起設有教師陽光專線，除支援教師處理工作壓力及精神健康的問題外，亦會按需要提供專業輔導服務、面談和安排專業人士跟進有關個案。同時，提供服務的機構亦會為教師舉辦有關減輕壓力的講座。此外，由二○二三／二四學年起，教育局每年委託非政府機構或大專院校為教師舉辦有關身心健康的課程，內容涵蓋精神健康、表達藝術、靜觀及強健體魄，支援教師提升工作的能量。

（三）社署資助香港撒瑪利亞防止自殺會營運自殺危機處理中心（中心），為有需要的人士提供即時危機介入和深入輔導服務等。中心亦為受自殺行為影響的人士（包括自殺者家人及朋友）提供支援服務，包括電話諮詢、小組活動、講座及工作坊。另外，分布全港各區的67間由社署或受資助非政府機構營辦的綜合家庭服務中心（包括兩間綜合服務中心）亦會為自殺者家人及親友提供適切的服務和協助，包括經濟援助、輔導服務及連繫社區資源。"
"Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao hold public health exercise in preparation for hosting 15th NG, NGD and NSOG (with photos)",2025-06-11 18:35,2025-06-11 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100318.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health, in collaboration with the health authorities of Guangdong Province and Macao, today (June 11) conducted a public health exercise, code-named ""Jingfeng"", to enhance the capacity of the three places to co-operate in preventing and controlling communicable diseases during major sports events. The exercise was held in preparation for the 15th National Games (15th NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD), and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG), which will be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao this November and December.

The exercise simulated a scenario in which two players participating in the 15th NG basketball competition in Hong Kong were diagnosed with meningococcal infection while they were in the city. An epidemiological investigation revealed that some of their close contacts had already departed Hong Kong for Shenzhen and Macao respectively. In accordance with the established mechanism, Hong Kong immediately notified the health authorities of Guangdong and Macao. The health authorities of the three places promptly traced the cases and implemented appropriate infection control measures to prevent the spread of the communicable disease.

During the exercise, the CHP, together with the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Bureau of Macao conducted a drill and exchanged views on communicable disease surveillance, prevention, control and notification mechanisms during the 15th NG, and 12th NGD and 9th NSOG via a video conference. More than 30 officers from the health authorities of the three places participated in the exercise.

Before the commencement of the exercise, the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, gave a speech. ""The 15th NG, and NGD and NSOG are the largest and highest-level national multisport events in the country. It is of great strategic significance for the health authorities of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao to jointly organise this exercise on communicable disease prevention and control at the countdown stage of the opening of the Games. Through the simulation, we hope to achieve three major objectives: to strengthen the joint prevention mechanism of the three places; to build a solid risk identification defense; and to consolidate the foundation of event protection. This will allow the top athletes in the country to demonstrate the country's sports prowess under a 'zero significant outbreak, zero cross-infections' condition, and showcase the country's excellence in public health governance to the world,"" he said.

Dr Lam added that since its establishment, the CHP has organised a total of 32 emergency response exercises and drills, simulating human cases of avian influenza, measles, plagues and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. As Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao are geographically and culturally connected, only through close collaboration can the three centres cope with major public health challenges. In the future, the three places will continue to strengthen joint efforts in the prevention and control of communicable diseases. They will maintain communication and collaboration on aspects such as the prevention and control of communicable diseases, and the development of the public health system, with a view to enhancing global health safety standards. They will also fulfil the tripartite co-operation agreement on public health emergencies and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Health Cooperation Consensus.

Apart from the health authorities of the three places, representatives from the Medical and Health Office of the Comprehensive Security Department of the Guangdong Provincial Executive Committees for the 15th NG, NGD and NSOG, National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong)of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Auxiliary Medical Service, the Fire Services Department and the Hospital Authority have also sent their staff to observe the exercise."

LCQ2: Developing Hong Kong into international education hub,2025-06-11 17:53,2025-06-11 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100670.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chu Kwok-keung and a reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

 The Government is now establishing the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for education. There are views pointing out that with the robust development of local basic education and the extensive recognition of the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination qualification, primary and secondary schools are well-positioned to admit non-local students amid the continuing decline in the number of students. At present, however, entry for non-local students to study in Hong Kong's public or aided primary and secondary schools (other than English Schools Foundation (ESF) schools and Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) schools) is not permitted. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of minor students coming to Hong Kong on student visas to study in private primary and secondary schools, ESF schools, and DSS primary and secondary schools over the past three school years, as well as the distribution of their years of study;

(2) whether it will consider drawing on the practices of other countries to relax the eligibility criteria for student visas, so as to allow non-‍local minor students entry into Hong Kong to study in public or aided primary and secondary schools, as well as introducing student guardian visas for their parents to stay in Hong Kong and engage in time-limited employment; and

(3) whether it will consider encouraging private enterprises or educational institutions to establish additional student hostels or overseas students' apartments to provide accommodation and ancillary services suitable for students of different ages, as well as establishing corresponding licensing and registration regimes?

Reply:

President,

 The Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the Government would promote the development of an international hub for post-secondary education by establishing the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand as well as pooling together and nurturing excellent global talents. The policy is built on the foundation that Hong Kong's universities enjoy an international reputation. Among our eight public universities, five are ranked among the world's top 100 and six within Asia's top 50, and four are among the top ten on the list of the most international universities in the world. The internationalisation and diversity of our post-secondary education attract outstanding talents from all over the world to Hong Kong for further studies and research. Meanwhile, the National 14th Five-Year Plan supports Hong Kong as a development centre in eight key areas (""eight centres""), the Education Bureau (EDB) has been proactively encouraging post-secondary education institutions to develop more related applied degree programmes to complement with the talent backing for the ""eight centres"". At the same time, we are also committed to promoting the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand, developing Hong Kong into an international education hub, attracting outstanding talent from all over the world in all aspects to enrich the local talent pool.

 Regarding our basic education, under the ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong has the distinctive advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world. We have been providing 12-year free and quality primary and secondary education to all local children through public sector schools, and parents of local children are offered with diversified choices. Meanwhile, non-local children can study in non-public sector schools, including international schools, private schools and Direct Subsidy Scheme schools, on a self-financing basis. These arrangements aim to ensure a reasonable balance between the supply and demand of school places in basic education in the relevant arrangements, while achieving prudent use of public funds. In fact, Hong Kong's diversified and quality school education system has long been ranked among the top in international education comparative studies.

 Having consulted the Security Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), our reply to the question raised by the Hon Chu Kwok-keung is as follows:

(1) In the past three years (2022 to 2024), a total of 1 686 applications for student visa/entry permit were approved by the ImmD for non-local children aged 17 or below coming to Hong Kong for education (see Annex). The ImmD and the EDB do not keep statistics on the types of schools admitting these students.

(2) The Government is committed to developing a vibrant international school sector to meet the demand for education from non-local families living in Hong Kong as well as children of families coming to Hong Kong for work or investment. International schools operate on a self-financing and market-driven basis and belong to the private school sector. They have been enjoying the flexibility, including the medium of instruction, curriculum arrangements, public examinations, etc, and they are not subsidised by public funds for daily operation, providing diversified choices for local parents, while offering school places to non-local children who pay school fees at their own expense under the ""user pays"" principle. As seen from the figures provided by the ImmD over the past three years, there have been hundreds non-local children aged from five years eight months to 17 years being approved with study visa/entry permit to come to Hong Kong for education annually. We will closely keep in view the demand for school places from non-local children, conduct dynamic assessments of the demand and supply of school places, create conditions in a timely manner, and launch policy measures to adjust the supply of school places including supporting the development of non-profit-making private schools offering non-local curriculum through the school allocation exercise. Meanwhile, we will proactively explore the feasibility of facilitating non-local students to come to Hong Kong to study in non-public sector schools on a self-financing basis.

 As the goal of public sector schools is to provide 12-year quality and free primary and secondary education to eligible children to meet the educational needs of local children, we adopt mother-tongue teaching. The medium of instruction, curriculum arrangements, public examination (i.e. Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination), etc in public sector schools are based on the learning needs of local children.

Therefore, for public sector schools, the Government has always been devoting substantial resources to public sector schools in providing quality education to students over the years, meeting the different learning needs of students in an all-round way, including catering for the learning diversity for students with special educational needs and non-Chinese speaking students with the provision of additional learning support and complementary measures. Public sector schools are publicly funded at full costs, offer local curriculum and serve local children. It ensures the prudent use of public funds and fair allocation of educational resources, and benefit local children.

 At present, the parallel development of the public sector schools and non-public sector schools not only caters for the learning needs of the children of different stakeholders, but also achieves the purpose of prudent use of public funds and an appropriate allocation of resources. Therefore, the policy meets Hong Kong's actual circumstances.

(3) In general, the boarding services provided by different types of schools are mainly aimed at enriching local students' learning experiences, and cater for the residential needs of a small number of non-local students. At present, there are a total of 16 publicly-funded and private ordinary primary and secondary schools across the territory, which provide boarding services offering about 3500 boarding places altogether. If individual schools have needs, and the premises and space allow, they can submit applications to the EDB to provide boarding facilities on a self-financing basis. We will consider the applications based on the actual needs. The facilities and management of boarding schools should comply with the relevant stipulations such as the Education Regulations (Cap. 279A). The accommodation arrangements outside schools should also comply with all relevant laws and requirements.

立法會二題︰發展香港成為國際教育樞紐,2025-06-11 17:53,2025-06-11 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100680.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上朱國強議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的答覆︰

問題︰

政府正打造「留學香港」品牌，發展香港成為國際教育樞紐。有意見指出，本地的基礎教育發展完善，香港中學文憑考試資歷廣受認可，在學童人數持續下跌之際，中小學有條件取錄非本地生。然而，現時本港不會批准非本地學生來港就讀公立或資助的小學及中學（英基學校協會學校及直接資助學校除外）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三個學年，持學生簽證來港就讀私立中小學、英基學校協會學校及直接資助中小學的未成年學生人數，以及其就讀年級的分布為何；

（二）會否考慮參考其他國家做法，放寬學生簽證資格，讓非本地未成年學生來港就讀公立或資助小學及中學，並設立陪讀簽證，供其家長來港居留及從事有時限工作；及

（三）會否考慮鼓勵私人企業或教育機構增設學生宿舍或留學公寓，提供適合不同年齡學生的住宿及配套服務，並制訂相應的牌照及註冊制度？

答覆：

主席：

行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》提出推進國際專上教育樞紐建設，打造「留學香港」品牌，匯聚和培育世界一流人才。有關政策是建基於香港的大學享譽國際，我們八所公營大學之中，五所進入世界百強，六所位列亞洲前五十強，四所在全球最國際化大學排名首十位。專上教育的國際化和多元化，吸引全球優秀人才來港升學和研究。國家「十四五」規劃確立香港作為八個重點領域的發展中心（「八大中心」），為此，教育局積極鼓勵各專上院校發展更多相應應用學位（課程），為「八大中心」做好人才支撐。同時，亦致力推廣「留學香港」品牌，建設香港成為國際教育樞紐，全方位吸引全球優秀人才，豐富本地的人才庫。

在基礎教育方面，「一國兩制」之下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，我們既通過公營學校，為所有本地兒童提供12年免費和優質的中小學教育，也透過非公營學校，包括國際學校、私立學校、直資計劃（直接資助計劃）學校，為本地家長提供多元選擇的同時，亦讓非本地兒童可以自費入讀，確保基礎教育的學額供求合理平衡，善用公帑。事實上，多元和優質的香港學校教育體系一直在國際教育比較研究中名列前茅。

就朱國強議員的提問，經諮詢保安局和入境事務處（入境處）後，重點回覆如下︰

（一）過去三年，即二○二二年至二○二四年，入境處共批出1686個學生簽證／進入許可，供17歲或以下的非本地人士來港就學（見附件）。入境處和教育局沒有備存上述學生就讀不同類別學校的統計數字。

（二）政府一直支持國際學校體系的蓬勃發展，以滿足在香港居住的非本地家庭，以及因工作或投資而來港居住的家庭子女的教育需要。國際學校以自負盈虧的市場模式運作，屬私立學校，在授課語言、課程安排、公開考試等方面享有彈性，日常營運不獲公帑資助，以「用者自付」原則，為本地家長提供多元選擇，亦讓非本地兒童自費入讀。從入境處過去三年的數字所見，每年均有約數百位年齡介乎五歲八個月至17歲的非本地人士獲批學生簽證／進入許可來港就學。我們會密切留意非本地兒童對學位的需求，動態評估學位供求情況，適時創設條件，推出政策措施，調整學額供應，包括透過校舍分配工作，支持提供非本地課程的非牟利私立學校的發展。同時亦會積極探討便利非本地生來港，以自費方式入讀非公營學校的可行性。

由於公營學校的目標是為合資格兒童提供12年優質的免費中小學教育，以滿足本地兒童的教育需要，所以我們採取母語教學，在授課語言、課程安排、公開考試，即香港中學文憑考試等，均以本地兒童的學習需要為依歸。

因此，就公營學校，政府投入大量資源為其學生提供優質教育，全方位滿足同學不同學習需要，包括為有特殊教育需要的學生、非華語學生等提供額外的學習支援和配套，照顧學習差異。公營學校全額由公帑資助，提供本地課程，確保善用公帑和公平分配教育資源，造福本地學童。

目前，公營學校與非公營學校雙線並行發展，照顧不同持份者子女的學習需要，我們要善用公帑和適當分配資源，所以雙軌並行的政策符合香港實況。

（三）一般而言，現時各類型學校設寄宿服務，主要是用作豐富本地學生學習經歷，以及照顧少量非本地學生的住宿需要。目前，全港總共有16所公帑資助及私立普通中小學提供宿舍服務，合共提供約3500個宿位。個別學校如有需要，在校舍、空間和配套條件許可的情況下，可向教育局申請以自資模式提供宿舍設施。我們會視乎實際需要，審批有關申請。寄宿學校的設施及管理須符合《教育規例》（第279A章）等有關規定；學校以外的住宿安排亦須符合相關法律及規定。教育局會密切留意非本地學生的住宿需要，包括不同類型學校所提供的寄宿設施，並會與學界及有關政府部門保持溝通，適時檢討相關安排。

主席，百年大計，教育為本，教育局會聆聽大家的意見，審慎考慮不同政策措施，發揮香港教育的優勢，有序推進國際專上教育樞紐建設，推動香港教育更高質量發展。

多謝主席。"

  A spokesman for the MD said, ""The objective of the SAR exercise is to test the communication efficiency, co-ordination capabilities and resource deployment among the SAR agencies in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. The exercise also aims to strengthen co-operation between Hong Kong and neighbouring regional SAR centres to enhance their response capabilities in the event of future major maritime emergency incidents.""

  The exercise simulated a collision between a cross-boundary high-speed passenger ferry carrying around 70 passengers from Macao to Hong Kong and a local oil tanker in the waters north of Shek Kwu Chau. The accident caused damage to the ferry's hull; two passengers on board went missing after falling overboard, and many passengers were injured. Following the collision accident, the local oil tanker caught fire, trapping a seriously injured crew member in the engine room.

  Under the co-ordination of the MD's Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, the participating SAR units took various contingency measures to carry out SAR operations. These operations included traffic regulation in the surrounding area to ensure safety at the scene to search for and rescue the missing persons who had fallen into the sea, extinguishing the fire on board the oil tanker, providing on-the-spot first aid to the injured, and deploying a helicopter to transfer the seriously injured to hospital for treatment. The exercise lasted about three hours, mobilising 17 SAR vessels, a helicopter and a total of more than 230 people.

  The MD regularly conducts exercises with various SAR units and maritime stakeholders to strengthen co-operation with SAR centres in neighbouring areas and provide effective and rapid SAR services."

食環署呼籲市民加強防範蚊患,2025-06-11 17:01,2025-06-11 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100303.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（六月十一日）公布，五月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之八點六，屬於二級水平，顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布情況頗為廣泛。相關政府部門已加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動。

五月份，在64個監察地區中，六個地區的分區誘蚊器指數高於百分之二十的警戒水平。有關的誘蚊器大多位於區內的私人住宅區、公共屋邨、學校、康樂設施及公眾地方，食環署已聯同相關政府部門立即採取行動，在有關地區加強防蚊及滅蚊工作。

另外，五月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點三，表示在發現有白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊成蚊的平均數量為一點三隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁www.fehd.gov.hk。

食環署發言人說：「本地蚊患情況與季節變化有顯著關係。在炎熱多雨的春夏月份（即五至九月），有利蚊子迅速繁殖，其間各監察地區的誘蚊器指數可能會相對較高。食環署提醒市民須繼續恆常的防蚊工作，特別是對構築物的維修及保養，填補隙縫、孔洞等可引致積水的潛在蚊子滋生地，減低蚊子滋生的機會。」

發言人續說：「政府關注五月份的蚊患情況，持續炎熱及有雨或導致該月白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數上升。食環署與相關政府部門已持續深化在各自管轄範圍的防蚊及滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊子滋生地、施放殺幼蟲劑、以霧化處理方式殺滅成蚊，並於適當位置設置捕蚊器等。食環署亦連同相關部門進行實地視察，並為部門提供專業意見和技術支援，協助它們迅速制訂和實施有效的滅蚊措施，同時加強公眾宣傳和教育。食環署會持續監察各區的蚊患情況，並迅速採取有效防治措施。」

食環署今年繼續分三期進行全港滅蚊運動，第二期滅蚊運動已於四月十四日展開，將於六月十三日結束。其間，食環署各分區辦事處會針對區內一些受關注的地點，例如公眾街巿、熟食中心和小販巿場等設施、單幢式樓宇、街道和後巷、大廈的公用地方、村屋、建築地盤、空置土地及路旁工地等，進行一連串的清除積水及防治蚊患行動。為進一步加強滅蚊的成效，食環署已聯同相關部門，於五月七日起展開第二期全城防蚊及滅蚊行動，除繼續第一期工作，包括清除潛在蚊子滋生地外，食環署呼籲私人物業管理公司及早維修處所以減少蚊子滋生地，並開始定時以超低微量噴灑方式殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器，以及在棄置的輪胎上鑽大洞。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。鄰近地區登革熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"
Public urged to strengthen anti-mosquito efforts,2025-06-11 17:01,2025-06-11 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100305.htm,"âThe Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (June 11) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in May was 8.6 per cent, at Level 2, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was fairly extensive. Relevant government departments have stepped up mosquito prevention and control actions.

In May, among the 64 survey areas, the area gravidtrap index in six areas exceeded the alert level of 20 per cent. The gravidtraps were mostly located in the vicinity of private residential areas, public housing estates, schools, recreational and sports facilities and public places. The FEHD has collaborated with relevant government departments by taking immediate action to strengthen mosquito prevention and control work in the area concerned.

Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in May was 1.3, which represented that an average of 1.3 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department website at www.fehd.gov.hk.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""There is a significant relationship between local mosquito infestation and seasonal changes. The gravidtrap indices in various survey areas would be relatively higher during hot and rainy spring and summer months (i.e. from May to September) as mosquitoes breed quickly. Members of the public are reminded to continue the routine mosquito prevention and control work, especially the repair and maintenance of structures. Cracks and dents that may accumulate water and become potential breeding grounds should be filled and levelled to reduce the chance of mosquito breeding.""

""The Government is concerned about the mosquito infestation in May. The increase in the monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus for May might be related to the continuously hot and rainy days in the month. The FEHD has continued to intensify the mosquito prevention and control work with relevant government departments in areas under their purview, including eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and placing mosquito trapping devices at suitable locations. The FEHD has also conducted site inspections with relevant departments, and provided them with professional advice and technical support to assist them in formulating and implementing effective anti-mosquito measures swiftly. At the same time, the FEHD has strengthened publicity and education. The FEHD will continue to monitor the mosquito infestation in all districts, and will conduct prompt and effective mosquito prevention and control work,"" the spokesman continued.

The FEHD will conduct a three-phase Anti-mosquito Campaign this year. The second phase of the territory-wide campaign was launched on April 14 and will run until June 13. During the period, the district offices of the FEHD will target areas that have drawn particular concern, such as public markets, cooked food centres and hawker bazaars, single-block buildings, streets and back lanes, common parts of buildings, village houses, construction sites, vacant sites and road works sites, to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work. To further enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control, the FEHD and relevant government departments have carried out phase two of the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations from May 7. In addition to the work of phase one, including eliminating potential mosquito breeding places, the FEHD called on property management entities to arrange for necessary repairs to their premises to minimise mosquito breeding places and commence adult mosquito control measures by means of regular ultra-low volume fogging operations.

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes, and drilling large holes in unused tyres. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

Aedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit dengue fever (DF). DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization recorded over 14 million DF cases, which was a record number. The dengue activity in neighbouring areas has remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."
LCQ6: Supply of car parking spaces,2025-06-11 17:00,2025-06-11 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100257.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

Regarding the supply of car parking spaces, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information on parking spaces for various vehicle classes (including private cars, commercial vehicles and motorcycles) in Hong Kong from 2022 to 2024: the number of parking spaces, the district distribution, the utilisation rate, the increase or decrease in the number of parking spaces due to redevelopment, new development or other projects, with a tabulated breakdown by type of parking space (e.g. public or temporary car parks, on-street parking spaces); whether it has projected the parking space demand from this year to 2029, and of the currently planned number of parking spaces for various vehicle classes to be built, their locations, the government departments responsible for building them and their expected completion dates;

(2) whether it has plans to conduct a comprehensive review of the supply of parking spaces for various vehicle classes in the territory and study the further opening of car parks in schools and government premises in various districts in the evenings and on public holidays for public use; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether, on the pretext of not affecting traffic flow and road safety, it will consider increasing the number of free on-street parking spaces, extending the parking hours for night-time parking spaces and installing multi-storey stacked parking systems to improve land use efficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

In response to Oral Question 1, the Government has outlined its parking policy and I am not going to repeat it here. We will adopt a multi-pronged strategy to comprehensively increase parking supply, including leveraging technology, fostering stronger collaboration among stakeholders, and prioritising the parking needs of commercial vehicles (CVs).

Having consulted the Transport Department (TD), a consolidated reply in response to the questions raised by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu is as follows:

(1) Over the past three years, the total number of parking spaces in Hong Kong has increased by more than 15 000, bringing the total to over 800 000 (Annex 1). The ratio of parking spaces to registered vehicles has improved, and the number of metered parking spaces has also grown (Annex 2). However, the recovery of some short-term tenancy (STT) car parks has led to a slight decline in CV parking spaces (Annex 3). To address this, we have implemented various measures to enhance CV parking supply. For example, public vehicle parks (PVPs) currently in operation and under construction will provide approximately 460 CV parking spaces, and we have mandated a minimum number of CV parking spaces in suitable STT car parks. The Government continues to collaborate actively with stakeholders to expand parking supply. Between 2022 and 2024, more than 25 000 additional parking spaces were introduced under urban redevelopment projects (Annex 4). Utilisation rates remain consistently high across all types of parking spaces, with metered parking spaces averaging around 90 per cent and trending upward. Among public car parks managed by the TD, utilisation rates range from approximately 80 per cent to 90 per cent, while STT car parks average around 60 per cent.

When advancing PVP projects, the TD assesses district-level parking demand based on illegal parking occurrences and the availability of facilities near project sites. For example, priority is given to areas with a high concentration of logistics trades for additional CV parking spaces. The TD will also consider conducting studies to forecast medium-to-long-term parking needs.

The currently operating and under-construction PVPs will provide over 3 200 parking spaces. We are also exploring the adaptive reuse of construction shafts left after the completion of the Central Kowloon Bypass, with plans to convert them into underground multi-storey car parks featuring automated parking systems (APS).

Over the next two years, the Government will introduce 12 000 additional parking spaces, with at least 500 designated for CVs. The actual quantity will be even higher when accounting for additional CV parking spaces from upcoming STT car parks and private development projects.

Our priority remains the expansion of CV parking spaces, particularly in areas facing shortages, and we will intensify efforts to promote APS. Through policy initiatives and co-ordinated action with districts, we are confident that Hong Kong's parking supply will continue to improve. Projected parking space supply estimates beyond 2025 are detailed in Annex 5.

(2) The standard of parking facilities in the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines (HKPSG) will be reviewed regularly and revised when necessary to meet future transportation and policy needs. The first batch of subsidised housing planned under the revised HKPSG in 2021 (Note) is scheduled for completion in 2026, providing approximately 4 700 parking spaces across 26 subsidised housing developments. This includes 220 CV parking spaces, as well as the introduction of 33 medium/heavy goods vehicle and 18 coach/bus shared-use loading and unloading bays for night-time CV parking. The TD is closely monitoring the implementation of the revised HKPSG and will review it as needed to ensure it aligns with the latest developments.

The Government Property Agency has opened around 1 000 parking spaces within the 12 joint-user general office buildings under its management, with some parking spaces available for public use throughout the day. Additionally, public car parks managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department provide more than 2 700 parking spaces for public use. The TD is actively collaborating with the Housing Department to explore the possibility of opening loading/unloading bays in five subsidised housing developments, including Sha Tin and Tsuen Wan for night-time CV parking, given the substantial parking demand from medium and heavy goods vehicles in these areas. Furthermore, the TD is working with the Education Bureau to encourage more schools to make school bus parking spaces available for student service vehicles during non-school hours, specifically to address CV parking needs.

(3) The TD has been proactively identifying suitable locations across districts to provide additional on-street parking spaces. As of 2024, more than 1 860 on-street night-time parking spaces have been designated. The free parking period for over 600 CV night-time parking spaces has been adjusted to start at 7pm, and future provisions of such spaces will aim to advance the free parking period as much as possible.

The Government has been implementing APS projects in suitable PVPs and STT car parks, as APS can nearly double the parking capacity within the same space. PVPs currently under construction will provide 1 000 automated parking spaces. Additionally, seven private car parks and three STT car parks are already equipped with APS. The PVPs are located in Tseung Kwan O, San Po Kong, Sham Shui Po, and Ma On Shan, while the STT car parks are in Tsuen Wan, Tai Po, Sham Shui Po, and Yau Ma Tei. Various APS models are being adopted, including puzzle-stacking as proposed in the question, vertical lifting and horizontal sliding, as well as circular shaft lifting systems.

The widespread adoption of APS in Hong Kong requires private sector involvement from the society. Both the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the TD have published APS implementation guidelines for industry reference. In the future, the TD will actively encourage developers to adopt APS and explore further incentive measures.

Thank you, President.

Note: The 2021 he revised HKPSG has increased the number of ancillary parking spaces for PCs in private and subsidised housing developments, the types and numbers of parking spaces for CVs in subsidised housing development, and introduced two types of ""shared-use"" parking spaces, one of which is to be shared by light goods vehicles and light buses, and the other by medium/heavy goods vehicles and coaches."

問題：

關於泊車位的供應，政府可否告知本會：

（一）二○二二年至二○二四年全港各類泊車位（包括私家車、商用車及電單車）的以下資料：車位數目、地區分布、使用率，以及因重建、新建或其他項目而增減的泊車位數目，並按泊車位類別（例如公共或臨時停車場，以及路旁泊車位等）以表列出分項資料；有否預測本年至二○二九年的泊車位需求，以及現時計劃興建的各類泊車位數目及其所在位置、負責興建的政府部門及預計完工時間為何；

（二）有否計劃全面檢視全港各類泊車位的供應情況，並研究進一步開放各區學校及政府建築物的停車場予公眾於晚間及假日使用；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）會否考慮在不影響交通暢順及道路安全的前提下，增設免費路旁泊車位及延長夜間泊車位的泊車時段，並增設升降橫移式立體停車位以提高土地使用效率；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

我剛才回答第一項質詢時，已述及政府的泊車位政策原則，在此我不再重複。我們會採取多管齊下的策略，全方位增加泊車位，當中包括善用科技、推動各方加強合作，及優先滿足商用車輛的泊車需求。

就顏汶羽議員提問的各個部分，經諮詢運輸署後，我的綜合回覆如下：

（一）過去三年，全港泊車位增加超過15 000個，泊車位總數已上升至超過80萬個（附件一），泊車位與領牌車輛數目的比例逐漸回升。收費路旁泊車位（咪錶位）數目亦有所增長（附件二）。因部分短期租約停車場被收回，商用車泊位稍微下降（附件三），我們已透過不同措施，增加商用車泊位，例如，已啓用及正在施工中的公眾停車場合共可提供約460個商用車泊位；以及在合適的短期租約停車場訂明最少須提供的商用車泊位數目。政府積極與各界合作，增加泊車位，在二○二二年至二○二四年間，因市區各地重建而增加的泊車位超過25 000個（附件四）。使用率方面，各類泊位的使用率持續高企，咪錶位平均達90%，並呈上升趨勢。運輸署轄下11個公眾停車場使用率介乎約80%至90%；短期租約停車場平均約60%。

在推展停車場項目時，運輸署會從地區層面估算未來的泊車位需求，包括檢視附近違例泊車情況及鄰近設施與配套，例如，在物流業較集中的地區，會優先考慮提供更多商用車泊位。運輸署也會積極考慮推展預測中長期泊車位需求的研究。

現時已啓用及正在施工中的政府公眾停車場項目合共可提供超過3 200個泊車位。我們正積極考慮善用中九龍繞道完工後留下的施工豎井，希望改建為地下多層停車場，並設置自動泊車系統。

政府未來兩年可新增12 000泊車位，當中至少500個為商用車泊位，增加的數目未包括將來的短期租約停車場及部份私人項目的商用車泊位，因此實際的數量將會更多。

我們會聚焦於增加商用車泊位，特別是較為短缺的地區，及加強推動自動泊車系統。透過我們的政策推動，加上和地區的配合，我們有信心香港泊車位供應將會持續改善。二○二五年後的泊車位供應估算載於附件五。

（二）政府不時檢視並適時修訂《香港規劃標準與準則》（《準則》）內的泊車設施標準，以滿足未來的運輸和交通政策需要。按二○二一年修訂的《準則》（註）規劃的首批資助房屋將於二○二六年落成，預計在26個資助房屋項目合共提供約4 700個泊車位，包括220個商用車泊位，其中有33個中／重型貨車及18個旅遊車／巴士共用上落客貨處可供車輛夜間停泊。運輸署正監察修訂《準則》的落實成效，適時檢視《準則》以確保與時並進。

政府產業署開放其轄下12個聯用辦公大樓約1 000個泊車位予公眾使用，部分車位更是全日開放。而康樂及文化事務署管理的公眾停車場提供超過2 700個泊車位。此外，運輸署正與房屋署積極探討率先在五個位於沙田、荃灣等有中／重型貨車停泊需求的公共屋邨的上落客貨處，在夜間開放給商用車停泊。運輸署亦正聯同教育局積極鼓勵學校於非上課時間，開放校內泊車位予學生服務車輛使用，希望針對性地滿足商用車的泊車需求。

（三）運輸署一直積極在各區物色合適位置增設路旁泊車位，截至二○二四年，全港已設置約1 860個路旁夜間商用車泊位，並將超過600個夜間商用車泊位的免費泊車時段提早至晚上七時開始，未來增設該類泊車位時，我們亦會盡量把免費泊車時段提早。

政府一直在合適的公眾停車場及短期租約停車場推展自動泊車系統，可有效提高同一空間的泊位高達一倍。施工中的公眾停車場項目有1 000個是自動化泊車位；另外，現時已有七個私人停車場及三個短期租約停車場設有自動泊車系統。興建中的政府公眾停車場位於將軍澳、新蒲崗、深水埗及馬鞍山；短期租約停車場則分布於荃灣、大埔、深水埗及油麻地，已採用問題提出的拼圖型，也有使用立體型及圓筒型系統。
​
香港要廣泛推展自動泊車系統，必須有社會上的私人發展商參與；機電工程署與運輸署已發布自動泊車系統的指引，供業界參考。未來運輸署會積極鼓勵發展商多應用自動泊車系統，並研究更多鼓勵措施。

多謝主席。

註：二○二一年修訂的《準則》上調了私人及資助房屋發展項目的私家車附屬泊車位數目，增加資助房屋發展項目的商用車泊位種類及數目，並引入兩款商用車輛「共用」泊車位，一款為輕型貨車及小型巴士共用，另一款為中型／重型貨車及旅遊巴共用。"
"SFST's speech at business reception for signing of Memorandum of Understanding between TheCityUK and Financial Services Development Council in London, United Kingdom (English only) (with photos)",2025-06-11 16:33,2025-06-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100278.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the business reception for the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TheCityUK and the Financial Services Development Council (FSDC) in London, the United Kingdom (UK), on June 10 (London time):

Alderman Sir Charles (690th Lord Mayor of the City of London, Co-Chair of the UK-China Green Finance Taskforce, Mr Alderman Sir Charles Bowman), Bruce (Leadership Council Chair of TheCityUK, Mr Bruce Carnegie-Brown), John (Managing Director of TheCityUK, Mr John Godfrey), King (Executive Director of the FSDC, Dr King Au), ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,

 It is an honour to stand before you in London to celebrate the signing of this Memorandum of Understanding between TheCityUK and Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council. I am very delighted to witness this milestone in strengthening financial co-operation between our two leading financial centres.

 This MOU is a commitment to deepen collaboration, foster innovation, and drive sustainable economic growth. It reflects a shared vision to harness the strengths of Hong Kong and the UK, creating opportunities that benefit our jurisdictions and the global financial ecosystem.

 Hong Kong is a premier international financial centre, strategically located at the heart of Asia, serving as a gateway between Mainland China and global markets. Our robust legal framework, adherence to international standards, and business-friendly environment underpin our success. The financial services sector is a cornerstone of our economy, driving growth through our world-class stock exchange, leadership in green finance, fintech, and asset management. Hong Kong's contributions to sustainable investment and digital innovation continue to set global benchmarks.

 The United Kingdom, with London as its financial hub, is a global leader in financial and professional services. TheCityUK represents an industry that contributes 12 per cent to the UK's economic output and employs nearly 2.5 million people. Its role in supporting net zero transitions, economic growth, and essential services is remarkable. The UK's expertise in financial innovation and regulation makes it an ideal partner for Hong Kong.

 This MOU outlines a forward-looking framework for co-operation in key areas: transition finance, digital assets, technological advancements, and workforce development. A few highlights this partnership are worth noting.

 First, the focus on transition finance is critical as the world moves toward net zero. Hong Kong is a leader in green bonds issuance and sustainable finance, with initiatives like government green bonds issuance setting a global benchmark. TheCityUK and the FSDC will share best practices to advance transition finance across the Asia-Pacific and beyond, ensuring our financial systems support a low-carbon future.

 Second, the emphasis on digital assets aligns with the rapid evolution of our industry. Hong Kong is advancing fintech through initiatives like our Central Bank Digital Currency pilot and digital asset regulations. The UK's leadership in distributed ledger technology and tokenisation complements these efforts. Through this MOU, both parties will exchange insights on regulatory practices, promote interoperability, and build capacity for responsible integration of digital assets.

 Third, workforce development is central to our success. Technological advancements are reshaping financial services, and both Hong Kong and the UK are committed to equipping our professionals with the skills needed to thrive. Collaborative efforts will ensure our workforces are prepared for an era of innovation.

 The MOU also facilitates practical co-operation through market visits, stakeholder introductions, and co-hosted events. These initiatives will strengthen the ties between our financial communities and drive meaningful outcomes.

 The economic ties between Hong Kong and the UK provide a strong foundation for this partnership. Our shared commitment to open markets, innovation, and excellence has long underpinned our collaboration. This MOU builds on that legacy, creating new avenues for partnership at a time when global challenges like climate change and technological disruption demand collective action. Together, we can unlock opportunities for growth and prosperity.

 I extend my heartfelt congratulations to TheCityUK and the FSDC for their vision and leadership. My gratitude goes to all who have worked to bring this MOU to fruition. Your efforts have laid the groundwork for a stronger financial relationship between our jurisdictions.

 Let us seize this opportunity to deepen our collaboration, leverage our strengths, and promote Hong Kong and the UK as leading global financial centres. Together, we can shape a future defined by innovation, sustainability, and opportunity.

Thank you, and I wish this partnership every success."

Lord Mayor (696th Lord Mayor of the City of London, Mr Alderman Alastair King), Sir Douglas (Committee Member of the Hong Kong Association, Chairman of Aberdeen Group, Sir Douglas Flint), distinguished guests, esteemed members of the Hong Kong Association, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon. It is a profound privilege to address you today at this distinguished luncheon hosted by the Hong Kong Association in London. I must say, you are a crowd too difficult to please because you know Hong Kong too well. This organisation's mission is to champion the enduring business and trading relationship between Hong Kong and the UK which resonates deeply with the Government's goal of fostering economic collaboration, innovation, and mutual prosperity. To further the efforts, I am here to showcase our city's unparalleled strengths as a global financial hub and to explore the vast potential for deepening financial co-operation between Hong Kong and the UK. Our shared visions and complementary expertise position us well to forge a partnership that drives transformative growth in an increasingly challenging and also uncertain global economy.

 If you may recall, for those people who came two years ago for a similar occasion where I spoke, I tried to group my speech in five alphabet letters, ABCDE. A is about Asia, B is about business as usual, C is about connectivity, D is about digitalisation whereas E is about ESG (environmental, social and governance). These are the five elements at the time I drafted the speech that something Hong Kong could offer to this part of the world. So I am thinking, to this group which is very knowledgeable about Hong Kong, what should I say and how I should structure this speech? Of course I don't want to get to the next alphabet letter after E, that is why I would stay at E and come with 3Es which are actually the pillars that define Hong Kong's strategic vision as a premier international financial centre: 1) Extending our financial value chain across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. For those in the banking or financial world, you know what I mean. It's about EFICC; 2) Embracing new finance through fintech and green finance; and 3) Enhancing offerings for Chinese companies going global through Hong Kong and international firms accessing the Mainland market. These pillars reflect our dynamic approach to navigating global economic and geopolitical challenges, seizing emerging opportunities, and fostering collaboration with partners like the UK. Let me elaborate on each pillar, highlighting our recent achievements and the opportunities they present for strengthening Hong Kong-UK ties.

Extending our financial value chain

 Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub is built on its ability to offer a diversified, resilient, and innovative financial ecosystem. By extending our financial value chain across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities which can be grouped as EFICC, we are creating a robust platform that serves both regional and international markets, fostering opportunities for collaboration with global partners, including the UK.

Equities: a vibrant and forward-looking market

 Hong Kong's equity market has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past decade, driven by bold structural reforms and a commitment to capturing global economic trends. The Hang Seng Index, which is a key barometer of our market's performance, has demonstrated resilience amid global uncertainties. By May 30, our stock market capitalisation has increased by 24 per cent year on year to over US$5.2 trillion. This growth was propelled, I must say, by a number of key moments this year, including of course the DeepSeek moment when people really recalibrate the value that Chinese investment carry and at the same time also the ""victory day"" moment when people are seeing the uncertainty in other parts of the world which actually present opportunities to Hong Kong and London. The average daily turnover for the first five months of this year stood at US$31 billion in our market, an increase of 1.2 times over the past year, signaling sustained investor confidence and market liquidity.

 Apart from the market performance, we are also trying to reform our capital market to make it more instrumental in positioning Hong Kong as a global hub for new economy and technology companies. Back in 2018, we already introduced the ""weighted voting rights"" regime, enabling companies with dual-class share structures to list in Hong Kong. As I know, London Stock Exchange is also contemplating something similar to reform your stock market. This reform in Hong Kong attracted technology giants and paved the way for a new era of innovation-driven listings. Simultaneously, we opened our market to pre-revenue biotech firms, transforming Hong Kong into one of the world's leading fundraising hubs for biotechnology. As a result, the proportion of new economy companies in our stock market has surged from 1.3 per cent in 2018 to approximately 14 per cent by April 2025, with their market capitalisation share rising from 2.8 per cent to about 28 per cent.

 Building on this momentum, we introduced the ""18C"" listing regime in 2023 for specialist technology companies, followed by a dedicated technology enterprises channel launched last month. These initiatives are designed to accelerate the listing of enterprises in the ""hard technology"" space, enabling them to raise capital in Hong Kong and expand their international presence. These reforms have not only reshaped the structure of our stock market but also aligned it with global economic trends, positioning Hong Kong as a vital partner for UK firms seeking exposure to Asia's innovation-driven growth.

 Moreover, Hong Kong's capital markets have benefited from the return of Chinese concept stocks, driven by geopolitical developments and Mainland China's technological advancements. This trend has elevated the weight of technology stocks in our market, further enhancing its attractiveness to global investors. For example, before I came, we welcomed the listing of CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited) which is a major lithium-ion battery manufacturing company serving the world for electric vehicles. For UK financial institutions, Hong Kong offers a gateway to invest in Asia's burgeoning tech sector, leveraging our deep liquidity and robust regulatory framework.

Connectivity and stability

 Apart from fundraising, it's about our strengthened role as a gateway for international investors accessing Mainland China and for Mainland investors diversifying globally. Our ""Connect"" schemes - Stock Connect, Bond Connect, Wealth Management Connect, and Swap Connect - have facilitated seamless cross-border capital flows. These initiatives have seen significant growth in transaction volumes, product diversity, and risk management capabilities, enhancing both the ""quantity"" and ""quality"" of financial connectivity, covering the broad financial value chain across equities, fixed income and currencies.

 Stability is also a cornerstone of our financial system, as demonstrated by the performance of the Hong Kong dollar recently. In the first five months of 2025, the Hong Kong dollar largely traded within the strong-side convertibility undertaking range, signifying a robust demand, partly because a lot of money coming to Hong Kong to buy our IPOs (initial public offerings) which are in Hong Kong dollars, and at the same time it is now the season when the listed companies need Hong Kong dollars to give out dividends. So with this background, what we see is operations by our banking regulator where now the banking system aggregate balances rising to US$22 billion by May 30, 2025, a substantial increase from US$5.7 billion at the end of last year. Total bank deposits grew by over 4 per cent in the first four months of 2025, with Hong Kong dollar deposits rising by 4.4 per cent, reflecting strong capital inflows into our banking system. So you have been hearing a lot about capital flight from Hong Kong to others, all these numbers are testaments to how wrong those perceptions are. This stability underscores our role as a trusted financial hub, like that of London, offering a secure environment for UK investors and businesses.

 Amid global economic uncertainties, including trade protectionism and unilateral policies, RMB (Renminbi) is gaining prominence as a global transaction and reserve currency. Its share in global payments rose from 2 per cent in 2020 to 4 per cent by the end of 2024, ranking fourth globally, while its share in trade financing increased from 2 per cent to 6 per cent. As the world's leading offshore RMB hub, Hong Kong is seizing this opportunity by enhancing RMB-denominated investment products and risk management tools. Our plan to integrate RMB-denominated stock trading into Southbound Stock Connect will further support RMB internationalisation in a gradual and prudent manner, creating opportunities for UK financial institutions to engage with RMB-based products and services.

Commodities: pioneering a new ecosystem with LME integration

 In the commodities sector, Hong Kong is capitalising on the global surge in non-ferrous metals trading, driven by the transition to new energy technologies. In 2024, the London Metal Exchange (LME) recorded trading volumes of 178 million lots, a 20 per cent year-on-year increase, with significant growth in new-energy metals like nickel and cobalt. These metals are critical to industrial transformation and technological advancement, and China remains a pivotal force, with non-ferrous metals trade exceeding US$368 billion in 2024, up 11 per cent from the previous year.

 Recognising this potential, our Chief Executive outlined a vision in his Policy Address to create a commodity trading ecosystem in Hong Kong, encompassing warehousing, distribution, trading, testing, certification, insurance, and financial services. A landmark achievement in this regard is our integration into the LME's global warehouse network in January this year. By bringing storage facilities closer to Mainland China's industrial heartlands and consumption centres, we are strengthening our role as a central platform for the metals industry. Within months since January this year when we are recognised as a delivery port for the LME contracts, seven warehouses have already been approved, and their operations will commence as early as in July 2025.

 This initiative not only enhances Hong Kong's commodities infrastructure but also creates significant opportunities for UK firms, given the LME's London-based heritage. The UK's expertise in commodities trading and Hong Kong's proximity to Asia's industrial markets make our partnership a natural fit. By collaborating on warehousing, trading, and related services, we can jointly tap into the growing demand for new-energy metals, supporting global industrial transformation and sustainable development.

 By extending our financial value chain across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities, Hong Kong is reinforcing its position as a diversified financial hub. We invite UK businesses to leverage our platform to access Asia's dynamic markets, fostering mutual growth and collaboration in these critical sectors.

Embracing new finance: fintech and green finance

 The second pillar of our strategy is embracing new finance, particularly in fintech and green finance, to position Hong Kong at the forefront of financial innovation and sustainability. These areas align closely with the UK's developments in digital finance and sustainable investments, creating fertile ground for partnership.

Fintech: pioneering digital assets and stablecoin regulation

 Hong Kong's robust regulatory framework, business-friendly environment, and strategic location make it an ideal hub for fintech innovation. My bureau, FSTB (Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau), in collaboration with financial regulators and industry stakeholders, is pursuing a multipronged strategy to foster a vibrant fintech ecosystem. This includes enhancing financial infrastructures, nurturing talent, strengthening industry connections in Mainland China and overseas, and creating a conducive environment for fintech innovation.

 This is my second day here in London and I am hearing a lot about digital assets (DAs). Just days before I embarked on this trip, our Legislative Council has passed the Stablecoins legislation in Hong Kong and it will be enacted on August 1. After that, we will issue a second policy statement about promoting Hong Kong as the digital asset ecosystem.

 Looking ahead, we will continue to be a leader in adopting emerging technologies. A 2023 survey revealed that 38 per cent of Hong Kong's financial institutions adopted generative AI, surpassing the global average of 26 per cent. In October last year, we issued a policy statement on the responsible use of AI in finance, followed by practical guidelines, sandbox schemes, and industry seminars to support institutions in adopting AI responsibly. These initiatives position Hong Kong as a hub for fintech innovation, complementing the UK's advancements in areas like blockchain and AI-driven financial services.

Green finance: driving sustainable development

 Moving on to green finance, Hong Kong is committed to mobilising cross-border investments to address climate and sustainability challenges, aligning with global efforts to achieve net zero. Last year, Hong Kong arranged US$43 billion in green and sustainable bonds, capturing 45 per cent of the Asian market and ranking first in the region for seven consecutive years. By March this year, our security regulator authorised around 220 ESG funds, managing US$140 billion in assets, an 80 per cent increase over three years.

 Last week we have just issued a new round of Government green bonds and infrastructure bonds, totally around US$3.5 billion, denominated in four currencies, namely HKD (Hong Kong dollars), RMB, USD (US dollars) and EUR (euro). The offering attracted participation from a wide spectrum of investors from more than 30 markets across Asia, Europe, Middle East, and the Americas, with total orders amounting around US$30 billion equivalent, representing an over-subscription of almost nine times. The proceeds from green bond issuance will fund local Government green works projects, and set benchmarks for the market encouraging private-sector participation.

 To align with global standards, we launched the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in December last year, providing a clear path for large publicly accountable entities to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB Standards) by 2028. This positions Hong Kong among the first jurisdictions to align with global sustainability reporting standards, enhancing transparency and comparability. The roadmap not only reflects our commitment to the global green transition but also offers clarity and guidance to market participants.

 On the funding support side, the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme, which was extended to 2027, subsidises issuance costs for bonds and loans, including transition financing, encouraging industries across the Greater Bay Area and Belt and Road economies to leverage Hong Kong's platform for low-carbon transitions. So for many of you who are working for business financial institutions or companies, do take this message home that we are subsidising for people who are issuing green bonds and loans in Hong Kong.

 These efforts create significant opportunities for UK firms to collaborate with Hong Kong on green finance initiatives, from ESG funds to green technology solutions, leveraging our shared commitment to sustainability and innovation. The UK's commitment in green finance, combined with Hong Kong's strategic position in Asia, can drive impactful partnerships in sustainable investment and technology.

Enhancing offerings for global and Mainland businesses

 The third pillar, enhancing offerings, underscores Hong Kong's role as a bridge for Chinese companies going global and international firms accessing Mainland China, supported by policies that facilitate cross-border mobility and business expansion.

Supporting Chinese companies going global

 As Mainland China accelerates its economic opening, Chinese firms are intensifying their global expansion, optimising supply chains and market presence to address geopolitical risks and tap into international markets. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to support this ""going out"" strategy, offering financing, supply chain management, and professional services under the ""one country, two systems"" framework.

 Hong Kong's efforts to strengthen ties with emerging markets further enhance our appeal. In October last year, we facilitated the listing of two Hong Kong-focused exchange-traded funds on the Saudi Exchange, attracting Middle Eastern capital to our markets. The two Saudi-listed ETFs have a combined size of over US$1.9 billion. They are the two largest ETFs listed and are amongst the top traded ETFs on Saudi Stock Exchange. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to connecting traditional and emerging markets, offering UK firms a platform to diversify their investments across Asia and beyond.

 Hong Kong's professional services, for example the Accounting sector, are well-positioned and experienced to meet the needs of Mainland firms going global. The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has earlier compiled a list of firms specialising in supporting global expansion of Chinese companies, and has recently expanded the list from 60 to over 80 firms, connecting Mainland enterprises with international markets for business expansion. Moreover, Hong Kong's network of 52 Comprehensive Double Taxation Agreements with other tax jurisdictions, with plans for further expansion, provides tax clarity for businesses, enhancing Hong Kong's appeal as a commercial and investment hub.

 UK firms can partner with Hong Kong to support Chinese companies' international ventures, leveraging our expertise in financing, legal services, and market access. For example, UK financial institutions can collaborate with Hong Kong-based firms to provide advisory services, underwriting, and risk management solutions for Chinese enterprises expanding into Europe and beyond.

Facilitating international access to the Mainland

 Hong Kong is equally committed to helping international talents, including those from the UK, access Mainland China's vast market. A facilitating policy introduced in July last year allows non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents to obtain a cardâtype document with five-year validity. This card enables self-service clearance at Mainland control points without going through manual channels, eliminating the need for arrival cards and significantly enhancing clearance efficiency. This measure, implemented under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, facilitates business, travel, and family visits, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a gateway to the Mainland.

 Hong Kong's professional services, with deep knowledge of Mainland business culture and international expertise, provide comprehensive support for UK firms navigating China's market. From legal and accounting services to supply chain management, Hong Kong offers a trusted platform for UK companies to establish and grow their presence in Asia.

Hong Kong-UK financial co-operation

 The complementary strengths between the two markets of Hong Kong and UK create a strong foundation for collaboration. The integration of Hong Kong into the LME's warehouse network opens new avenues for UK firms to engage with Asia's commodities markets, particularly in new-energy metals critical to the global energy transition. Our leadership in green finance aligns with the UK's expertise in sustainable investments, creating opportunities for joint ventures in ESG funds, carbon trading, and green fintech. In fintech, Hong Kong's progressive DA regulations complement the UK's advancements in digital finance, paving the way for collaborative innovation in areas like blockchain, AI, and stablecoins.

 By leveraging Hong Kong's strengths in extending our financial value chain, embracing new finance, and enhancing global and Mainland connectivity, we invite UK businesses to partner with us in tapping Asia's growth opportunities. Our shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and global connectivity positions us to build a future of mutual prosperity.

Conclusion

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong stands at the forefront of global finance, driven by our commitment to the 3Es: Extending our financial value chain across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities; Embracing fintech and green finance; and Enhancing opportunities for Chinese and international businesses. Our unique position under ""one country, two systems,"" robust regulatory framework, and vibrant markets make Hong Kong the ideal partner for the UK in navigating Asia's dynamic markets.

 I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Hong Kong Association for hosting this luncheon and for your unwavering commitment to strengthening Hong Kong-UK ties. Let us seize this opportunity to deepen our financial partnership, fostering innovation, sustainability, and prosperity for our shared future. Together, we can shape a world of opportunity, leveraging Hong Kong's strengths and the UK's global leadership to drive transformative growth.

 Thank you."
財庫局局長向英國各界展示香港拓展國際金融合作的決心（附圖）,2025-06-11 16:29,2025-06-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100369.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇六月十日（倫敦時間）出訪英國倫敦期間表示，香港站在全球金融和數碼資產變革的前沿，與英國在追求創新和可持續發展的世代擁有共同願景，可優勢互補透過轉型取得經濟增長。

許正宇在六月十日（倫敦時間）英國香港工商協會舉辦的午餐會上致辭時強調，香港作為領先的國際金融中心，正致力推動體現其戰略願景的三大主柱：拓展涵蓋股票、固定收益、貨幣及大宗商品的金融價值鏈；擁抱金融科技和綠色金融；以及為中國和國際企業創造更多發展機會。

他表示，香港的金融生態圈多元化、韌性強，且富於創新，加上政府決心拓展金融價值鏈，正好為區域和國際市場打造一個穩健發展的平台。在地緣政治和內地科技飛躍的驅動下，香港的資本市場蓬勃向好，為包括英國投資者在內的全球投資者提供門戶和通道，讓其借助香港流動性高的巿場環境和穩健的監管框架，涉足亞洲發展迅速的科技行業。

提到英國在大宗商品交易領域的優勢時，許正宇表示香港今年一月獲納入倫敦金屬交易所的全球倉庫網絡，不僅強化香港的大宗商品基礎設施，也為英國企業帶來重大機遇。香港毗鄰亞洲工業市場，可與英國在需求日增的新能源金屬巿場合作，並支持全球產業轉型和可持續發展。

訪英行程亮點之一是香港金融發展局（金發局）與英國金融城協會簽署諒解備忘錄，建立合作夥伴關係，以分享見解和最佳實務流程，推動轉型金融；培育人員技能，以滿足不斷變化的市場需求；並建立年度審核框架，以評估合作進展和探索新機遇。諒解備忘錄由金發局行政總監區景麟博士和英國金融城協會公共事務、政策與研究董事總經理John Godfrey代表簽署。

雙方於六月十日（倫敦時間）在許正宇與英國金融城協會領導委員會主席BruceCarnegie-Brown共同見證下簽署諒解備忘錄。許正宇表示，諒解備忘錄體現了雙方期盼善用香港和英國優勢，創造機遇，造福兩地以至全球金融生態圈的共同願景。

在簽署儀式前，許正宇亦與英國金融城協會的成員舉行了圓桌會議。英國金融城協會代表的金融及相關業界貢獻英國經濟產能超過12%、僱用近250萬名員工。許正宇說，現今投資者均嚮往守則清晰一致和高度可信的巿場，而這些恰恰是香港固有的特質。另外，香港在推動結合傳統金融服務與創新的數碼資產技術應用，促進實體經濟活動的同時，繼續通過本地的監管框架秉持在創新與投資者保障之間取得平衡的使命。總的來說，香港是英國理想的合作夥伴，尤其是在財富管理和數碼資產領域，攜手開拓互惠共榮的新維度。

許正宇在同日較早時間與倫敦金融城市長靳翊偉舉行雙邊會議，向他介紹香港如何受益於匯聚全球與內地優勢的獨特定位，在金融服務領域的最新發展。他亦與普華永道英國Chief Markets Officer Carl Sizer會面，討論會計和審計業界在助力內地企業「出海」的專業角色。

許正宇六月九日上午（倫敦時間）出席英國獨立智庫「亞洲之家」的成員分享會，向其成員介紹香港以至大灣區的最新金融發展。他又在「亞洲之家」行政總裁Michael Lawrence主持的答問環節中，回應現場成員對香港金融前景的提問。成員們對香港與國際市場的聯繫以及香港在金融科技領域的發展尤感興趣。

許正宇向成員表示，在全球金融巿場充滿挑戰之際，香港金融市場反而走勢甚佳。在今年首五個月，香港證券市場平均每日成交額達310億美元，較去年同期增長120%。政府也積極推動金融科技發展，例如引入將於今年八月生效的《穩定幣條例》。

在與工銀標準銀行的午餐會議上，許正宇向其總經理王文彬及其他高層管理人員介紹了香港正在構建的國際黃金交易巿場和大宗商品交易生態圈，雙方並就香港如何發揮箇中的巨大潛力有很深入的討論。該行是一國際銀行平台，專為客戶提供與大宗商品、固定收益和貨幣產品相關的服務。

下午，許正宇與英國財政部經濟事務秘書Emma Reynolds及其他金融官員會面，加強兩個頂尖國際金融中心之間的金融夥伴關係。會上，許正宇向他們介紹了香港資本市場的最新情況。

許正宇也拜會了中國駐英國使館公使王起。

在完成英國行程後，許正宇於六月十一日（倫敦時間）轉往挪威奧斯陸繼續其訪問行程。"
SFST showcases to UK community Hong Kong's determination to expand international financial co-operation (with photos),2025-06-11 16:29,2025-06-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100364.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, saidon June 10(London time) during his visit to London, the United Kingdom (UK), that Hong Kong is at the forefront of global finance and the digital asset revolution. The city shares the same vision and has complementary expertise with the UK, allowing the two places to drive transformative economic growth through partnership in an era of innovation and sustainablity.

Speaking at a luncheon held by the Hong Kong Associationof the UK on June 10(London time), Mr Hui highlighted Hong Kong's commitment to three key pillars, namely the 3Es that define the city's strategic vision as a premier international financial centre. The 3Es refer to extending financial value chain across equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities; embracing fintech and green finance; and enhancing opportunities for Chinese and international businesses.

He said Hong Kong's ability to offer a diversified, resilient and innovative financial ecosystem and the Government's determination to extend the financial value chain are creating a robust development platform that serves both regional and international markets. The vibrant capital markets in Hong Kong, driven by geopolitical developments and the Mainland's technological advancements, are also offering global investors, including those from the UK, a gateway and access to invest in Asia's burgeoning tech sector by leveraging Hong Kong's deep market liquidity and robust regulatory framework.

While mentioning the UK's expertise in commodities trading, Mr Hui remarked that Hong Kong's integration into the London Metal Exchange's global warehouse network in January this year not only enhances Hong Kong's commodities infrastructure but also creates significant opportunities for UK firms. Riding on Hong Kong's proximity to Asia's industrial markets, Hong Kong can partner with the UK to jointly tap into the growing demand for new-energy metals and support global industrial transformation and sustainable development.

Among the highlights of the UK leg was the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Financial Services Development Council (FSDC) and TheCityUK to establish a partnership in sharing insights and best practices to advance transition finance, collaborating on workforce development to address evolving market requirements, as well as establishing a framework to conduct an annual review to assess progress in collaboration and explore new opportunities. The MOU was signed by the Executive Director of the FSDC, Dr King Au, and the Managing Director of Public Affairs, Policy and Research of TheCityUK, Mr John Godfrey.

Mr Hui, together with the Leadership Council Chair of TheCityUK, Mr Bruce Carnegie-Brown, witnessed the signing of the MOU on June 10(London time). Mr Hui said that the MOU reflects a shared vision to harness the strengths of Hong Kong and the UK, creating opportunities that benefit both places and the global financial ecosystem.

Prior to the signing ceremony, Mr Hui had a roundtable meeting with members of the TheCityUK, which represents an industry contributing over 12 per cent of the UK's economic output and employing nearly 2.5 million people in financial and related professions. Mr Hui said that investors nowadays are gravitating towards markets that provide clarity, consistency and credibility, which are qualities that Hong Kong embodies in abundance. Moreover, Hong Kong continues to uphold the mission of striking a balance between innovation and investor protection through its regulatory framework in the process of integrating traditional financial services with innovative digital asset technologies for facilitating real economy activities. All in all, Hong Kong is an ideal partner for the UK to work with in unlocking horizons for growth and prosperity, especially in areas of wealth management and digital assets.

Earlier in the day, Mr Hui had a bilateral meeting with the Lord Mayor of the City of London, Mr Alderman Alastair King, to update him on Hong Kong's latest developments on the financial services front, which benefit from the unique convergence of global and Mainland advantages. He also met with the Chief Markets Officer of PwC UK, Mr Carl Sizer, to discuss the role the auditing and accounting profession can play to support Mainland enterprises going global.

In the morning ofJune 9(London time), Mr Hui attended a members briefing of a British independent think-tank, Asia House, to enlighten its members on the latest financial developments of Hong Kong as well as the Greater Bay Area at large. In a Q&A session moderated by the Chief Executive of Asia House, Mr Michael Lawrence, Mr Hui responded to members' questions about Hong Kong's financial outlook. The members were particularly interested in Hong Kong's connectivity with international markets and the city's fintech development.

Mr Hui told the members that Hong Kong has been experiencing a flourishing financial market amid the challenging global financial landscape. The securities market of Hong Kong recorded an average daily turnover of US$31 billion for the first five months of 2025, a year-on-year increase of 120 per cent. The Government is also taking bold moves to boost fintech development, such as introducing the Stablecoins Ordinance which is scheduled to be enacted this August.

During a lunch meeting with representatives of the ICBC Standard Bank on the same day, Mr Hui introduced to its Chief Executive Officer, Mr Wang Wenbin, and other senior management, the international gold trading market and commodity trading ecosystem that Hong Kong is shaping. Both parties had a very productive discussion about the vast potential that Hong Kong may bring about. The bank serves as a global banking platform for commodities, fixed income and currency products for clients.

In the afternoon, Mr Hui met with the Economic Secretary to the Treasury of the UK, Ms Emma Reynolds, and other financial officials to reinforce the financial partnership between the two leading international financial centres. At the meeting, he gave them an update on the latest situation of capital markets in Hong Kong.

Mr Hui also paid a courtesy call on Minister of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom Mr Wang Qi.

After concluding the UK leg, Mr Hui proceeded to Oslo, Norway,on June 11(London time) to continue his visit."
立法會二十二題：慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃,2025-06-11 16:15,2025-06-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100417.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上吳秋北議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（慢病共治計劃）於二○二三年十一月推出，讓合資格人士在政府資助下於私營醫療市場接受篩查，並在診斷出有血糖偏高、糖尿病和高血壓後，由家庭醫生作長期跟進。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於「普通科門診公私營協作計劃」和慢病共治計劃均針對慢性病及採用公私營協作模式，過去兩年，該兩項計劃的以下資料分別為何：（i）服務覆蓋人數、參與人數及參與率，以及服務人次；（ii）私家醫生的參與數目及參與率；（iii）私家醫生／診所獲得的資助額；及（iv）資助額佔標準治療成本的比例；

（二）目前參與慢病共治計劃的私營普通科醫生和專科醫生的以下資料分別為何：（i）參與數目及佔比；（ii）提供服務數量；及（iii）收取的治療共付額的最高值、最低值及中位數；

（三）政府有否就慢病共治計劃的私家醫生參與數目及參與率訂立目標；

（四）鑑於有意見指出，在慢病共治計劃下，政府就醫生每次只收取參加者150元的診症共付額的建議，未有充分考慮專科醫生的專業服務成本，以致當有專科醫生收取高於共付額的診金時，背負「濫收費用」的指責，政府在釐定診症共付額水平時，有否評估專科醫生與普通科醫生的服務成本差異；如否，原因為何；如有，差異為何，以及會否考慮向市民解釋專科與普通科醫生成本差異，以避免市民將收費問題簡化為醫生牟利而令醫生承受輿論壓力；

（五）鑑於有市民反映，透過慢病共治計劃進行檢測（例如甲狀腺功能檢測（即促甲狀腺激素及游離甲狀腺素等））後，發現患上糖尿病和高血壓以外的疾病，但該計劃卻未有為該等疾病的治療提供資助，政府會否考慮擴大慢病共治計劃的治療資助範圍，又或僅保留對直接與糖尿病及高血壓有關的檢測資助，以避免產生無法對接的醫療需求；及

（六）鑑於慢病共治計劃設有「達標獎勵」，如該計劃參與者由第二個計劃年度開始達到指定健康指標，將可於下一個計劃年度第一次接受資助診症時，扣減最高150元共付額，在最近一個計劃年度達到指定健康指標的人數，以及其佔該計劃總參與人數的比例為何；政府有否評估實施達標獎勵的成效？

答覆：

主席：

就吳秋北議員提問的各部分，經諮詢基層醫療署和醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現回覆如下：

（一）、（二）及（三）

普通科門診公私營協作計劃（門診協作計劃）

醫管局自二○一四年年中起分階段推行門診協作計劃，資助患有高血壓及／或糖尿病（或附帶高血脂症）、情況穩定的病人除了可選擇於普通科門診覆診，也可選擇接受社區內的私營基層醫療服務，希望減輕公營普通科門診診所的服務壓力。醫管局會邀請符合指定臨床及計劃準則，並在醫管局門診診所接受治理至少十二個月的病人自願參加計劃。下表載列過去兩年參與門診協作計劃的私家醫生和病人人數：

「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」）

政府二○二三年十一月推出「慢病共治計劃」，資助45歲或以上未曾確診患有糖尿病或高血壓的香港居民，在私營醫療市場接受糖尿病及高血壓篩查服務，旨在推動「早預防、早發現、早治療」的慢性病管理目標。

「慢病共治計劃」自推出以來反應良好，截至二○二五年五月三十一日，共約131 200名市民已參加此計劃，預料能較預期時間提早達到三年先導期內有二十萬名市民參加的目標。超過74 900名（即接近六成）參加者已完成篩查（註一）。接近31 100名（即接近四成）已完成篩查的參加者被診斷為血糖偏高（註二），或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂，他們可進入治療階段並在政府資助下由自行選擇的家庭醫生繼續為其診治，以及按個人健康狀況獲處方藥物，接受護士診所和專職醫療服務跟進。

與此同時，政府正分階段將「慢病共治計劃」擴展至指定普通科門診診所，為弱勢社群（綜合社會保障援助計劃受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受惠人，或持有有效醫療費用減免證明書者）提供計劃下的慢性疾病預防篩查服務和護理服務，並按相關資格獲全數豁免或部分減免費用。首階段服務已於二○二五年三月在七間普通科門診診所（見附件）開展，並計劃於今年年底擴展至全港十八區均有普通科門診診所提供有關服務。截至二○二五年五月三十日，已有超過1 000人次於相關普通科門診診所接受包括「三高」（即高血壓、高血糖及高血脂）的篩查和護理服務。

截至二○二五年五月二十九日，「慢病共治計劃」下私營界別家庭醫生（包括專科醫生）數目超過640名，覆蓋859個服務點。下表載列「慢病共治計劃」的篩查階段和治療階段，家庭醫生就每名病人可獲得的資助額及參加者共付額：

註四：政府建議的治療階段診症共付額為每次150元。
註五：由於進位關係，百分比相加後未必等於100%。
註六：三名家庭醫生釐定的共付額為0元。
註七：370名家庭醫生釐定的共付額為150元。
註八：最高共付額為800元。

政府會深化公私營基層醫療雙軌並行、互補協作的服務模式，透過私營家庭醫生和地區康健網絡以共付模式為市民提供慢性疾病篩查及管理，同時亦會重新定位醫管局普通科門診，專為向弱勢社群提供全面基層醫療服務。為彰顯基層醫療發展方向，醫管局於今年內將其普通科門診與家庭醫學專科服務統一命名為家庭醫學門診服務。政府亦會以基層醫療服務模式，將門診協作計劃的合適病人逐步整合至「慢病共治計劃」下繼續照顧。

（四）政府在釐定「慢病共治計劃」的資助額時考慮了市場價格、市民的負擔能力、服務需求和選擇，以及計劃的吸引力等一籃子因素。

「慢病共治計劃」的核心服務是慢性疾病管理，服務內容不應因家庭醫生是否具專科資格而異。現行制度下，參與計劃的家庭醫生可根據其服務內容訂定共付額。政府已於二○二四年三月完成計劃的前期檢討，並據此推出優化措施，包括允許參與計劃的家庭醫生（不論專科或普通科醫生）在篩查階段訂明不高於120元的共付額，和於治療階段自行釐定診症共付額，且可按既定機制每年調整一次。未來若於「慢病共治計劃」下，專科與普通科醫生的指定服務有所分別，政府會就資助安排再作考慮。

政府已將所有參加計劃的家庭醫生名單及基本資料（包括執業地區和所參與的其他政府資助基層醫療健康計劃（例如長者醫療券計劃）），及其在篩查階段和治療階段的指定診症共付額，上載於計劃「慢病共治計劃」的專題網站，讓市民能清楚比較並作出知情選擇。政府鼓勵參加者善用專題網站的資訊，地區康健中心／站職員亦可提供協助。政府會持續監察計劃實施情況，確保收費機制既能保障市民權益，亦能合理反映醫療專業服務的價值，並在有需要時考慮深化及完善相關機制。

（五）「慢病共治計劃」現階段聚焦於「三高」（即高血壓、高血糖及高血脂）的篩查與管理。如參加者透過計劃檢測發現「三高」問題，但同時發現其他健康問題（如甲狀腺功能異常），或有其他病情需要，可以於治療階段的任何一次資助診症中，同時治理目標慢性疾病和偶發疾病。「慢病共治計劃」設有基本藥物名單，涵蓋治療「三高」的基本藥物，以及治療偶發性疾病的基本藥物（如抗生素和治理相關健康問題的藥物）。在政府資助下，獲處方名單所列藥物的參加者無須支付任何藥費。政府鼓勵「慢病共治計劃」參加者與配對家庭醫生保持長期關係，並由家庭醫生跟進其健康狀況，包括治療糖尿病、高血壓和高血脂以外的疾病。

政府會根據科學實證和資源運用等的考慮因素，定期檢視基層醫療服務及「慢病共治計劃」服務範圍，以推動跨專業護理，及為計劃參加者提供涵蓋範圍更廣、連貫性更好的醫療服務。長遠而言，「慢病共治計劃」將會逐步擴展涵蓋更多目標病種和健康狀況。相關配套包括護理、專職醫療、藥劑、化驗、藥物及放射診斷等完整服務網絡。

（六）「慢病共治計劃」設有醫患合作達標獎勵機制，以鼓勵家庭醫生和計劃參加者積極參與治療過程。所有符合目標的病人（例如有自我監察健康指數並上傳到醫健通流動應用程式、定時覆診、完成健康教育項目或指定檢查等），在達標後的下一個個人計劃年度開始時，第一次受資助治療診症共付額將最高獲扣減150元（註九）。家庭醫生在符合先決條件（即病人血糖及血壓控制方面達到既定的百分比）亦可獲相應的獎勵金額（註十）。

達標獎勵機制由參加者進入治療階段後的第二個個人計劃年度開始進行評估。由於「慢病共治計劃」推行至今僅一年半，尚無參加者完成完整評估周期，故目前未能提供達標人數及比例。政府將於首批參加者完成第二年個個人計劃年度後就獎勵機制成效進行分析。

註一：「慢病共治計劃」初期（二○二五年三月二十八日前）的篩查項目為糖尿病及高血壓，其後擴展至包括血脂檢查。因此，完成篩查的參加者中，部分只接受了糖尿病和高血壓篩查，其餘則接受「三高」篩查。

註二：血糖偏高至糖化血紅素6.0-6.4%或空腹血糖6.1-6.9 mmol/L水平。

註九：政府建議的治療階段診症共付額。

註十：按達標病人實際出席的資助診症次數、政府診症資助額及建議共付額所合算的總額，以百分之十五來計算獎勵金額。"
LCQ22: Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme,2025-06-11 16:15,2025-06-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100420.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Stanley Ng and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

  The Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme) was launched in November 2023, under which eligible persons are subsidised by the Government to undergo screening in the private healthcare sector and, upon diagnosis of prediabetes, diabetes mellitus (DM) or hypertension (HT), will be taken care of by their family doctors with long-term management. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that both the General Outpatient Clinic Public-Private Partnership Programme and CDCC Pilot Scheme target chronic diseases and adopt a public-private partnership model, of the following information on each programme/scheme in the past two years: (i) the number of persons covered by the services, the number of participants, the participation rate and the service attendance; (ii) the number of participating private doctors and their participation rate; (iii) the amount of subsidies received by private doctors/clinics; and (iv) the proportion of the amount of subsidies to the costs of standard treatment;

(2) of the following information on private general practitioners and specialists currently participating in CDCC Pilot Scheme: (i) the number and percentage of participants; (ii) the number of services provided; and (iii) the highest, lowest and median amounts of co-payment fees charged for treatment;

(3) whether the Government has set targets for the number of private doctors participating in CDCC Pilot Scheme and their participation rate;

(4) as there are views pointing out that the Government's recommended co-payment fee of only $150 per consultation for doctors to charge participants under CDCC Pilot Scheme does not take into full account of the professional service costs of specialists, leading to accusations of ""overcharging"" when specialists charge a co-payment fee more than this amount, whether the Government, in determining the co-payment level, has assessed the differences in service costs between specialists and general practitioners; if not, of the reasons for that; if so, the differences and whether it will consider explaining to members of the public the cost differences between specialists and general practitioners, so as to prevent them from simplifying the fee issue as doctors making profits and bringing pressure from public opinions to bear on doctors;

(5) as some members of the public have relayed that after undergoing tests under CDCC Pilot Scheme, such as thyroid function tests (i.e. thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxine), they were found to have diseases other than DM and HT, but the scheme does not subsidise treatment for such diseases, whether the Government will consider expanding the scope of subsidised treatment under CDCC Pilot Scheme or limiting subsidies to only those tests which are directly related to DM and HT, so as to prevent the emergence of unmet medical needs; and

(6) given that an incentive mechanism has been set up under CDCC Pilot Scheme whereby, starting from the second programme year, participants who achieve health incentive targets will enjoy a reduction of co-payment fee with a maximum amount of $150 for their first subsidised consultation in the following programme year, of the number of participants who achieved health incentive targets in the most recent programme year and their percentage in the total number of scheme participants; whether the Government has assessed the effectiveness of implementing the incentive mechanism?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Primary Healthcare Commission and the Hospital Authority (HA), the replies to the respective parts of the question raised by the Hon Stanley Ng are as follows:

(1), (2) and (3)

General Outpatient Clinic Public-Private Partnership Programme (GOPC PPP)

  The HA has implemented the GOPC PPP by phases since mid-2014 to subsidise clinically stable patients with hypertension (HT) and/or diabetes mellitus (DM) (with or without hyperlipidaemia) to choose to receive follow-up consultations at General Out-patient Clinics (GOPCs), or to receive primary healthcare services from private services providers in the community, with a view to relieving the service pressure off of the public GOPCs. Patients fulfilling specified clinical criteria and programme requirements and have been attending the HA's GOPCs for at least 12 months will be invited to join voluntarily. The table below lists the number of Participating Service Providers (PSPs) and participating patients in the GOPC PPP in the past two years:




GOPC PPP

Number of PSPs
656
622
623


Number of patients
54 716
51 228
50 945




  Patients participating in the GOPC PPP are currently required to pay the HA's GOPC fee for each consultation (i.e. $50). Each participating patient will receive up to 10 subsidised consultations per year, including treatments for both chronic and episodic illnesses. Upon private doctor's referral, they can also receive X-ray examinations provided by the HA, or specified laboratory tests and electrocardiography at the HA's designated private laboratories. When the HA's new fees (including the GOPC and Family Medicine Specialist Clinic (FMSC) services, will be unify under the name of Family Medicine Outpatient (FMOP) Services, at $150 per consultation and $5 per drug item per four-week period) come into effect on January 1, 2026, the new fees will also be applicable to GOPC PPP patients. The table below lists the consultation subsidy and quarterly drug subsidy received by each patient participating in the GOPC PPP in the past two years:

Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme)

  The Government launched the CDCC Pilot Scheme in November 2023, providing subsidised DM and HT screening services in the private healthcare sector to Hong Kong residents aged 45 or above with no known medical history of DM or HT, so as to achieve the chronic disease management objectives of ""early prevention, early identification and early treatment"".

  The CDCC Pilot Scheme has been well received since its launch. As at May 31, 2025, around 131 200 individuals in total have enrolled in the Scheme, and it is expected that the target of having 200 000 participants during the three-year pilot period can be achieved earlier than expected. More than 74 900 participants (i.e. about 60 per cent) have completed the screenings (Note 1), and around 31 100 of those who had completed screenings (i.e. about 40 per cent) have been diagnosed with prediabetes (Note 2), DM, HT or hyperlipidaemia. The latter patients can proceed to the treatment phase and will be subsidised by the Government to continue their treatment with self-selected Family Doctors (FDs), and subject to their health conditions, be offered prescribed medication and follow-up care at nurse clinics and allied health services.

  At the same time, the Government is expanding the CDCC Pilot Scheme in phases to designated GOPCs to provide the underprivileged group (recipients of the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme, recipients of the Old Age Living Allowance aged 75 or above, or persons holding a valid medical fee waiver certificate) with preventive screening and care services for chronic diseases under the Scheme, with full or partial waiver of fees according to their eligibility. The first phase of the service was launched in seven GOPCs in March 2025 (see Annex), with plans to extend the services to have GOPCs in all 18 districts to provide relevant services by the end of this year. As at May 30, 2025, there were more than 1 000 attendances at the relevant GOPCs for screening and care services for the ""three highs"" (i.e. high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol).

  As at May 29, 2025, over 640 FDs (including specialists) in the private sector have participated in the CDCC Pilot Scheme, covering 859 service points. The table below lists the amount of subsidy and the participants' co-payment fee that an FD can receive per patient during the screening and treatment phases of the CDCC Pilot Scheme:





			
Consultation Subsidy

			Co-payment Fee
Drug Subsidy (Note 3)

As determined by FD
			Government recommendation: $150
			(Per subsidised consultation)

Note 3: Drugs prescribed must be chronic disease drugs included in the CDCC Pilot Scheme Drug List.

  The range of co-payment fee in the treatment phase set by FDs is set out in the table below:




Co-payment levelã(Note 4)

Note 4: The Government recommended consultation co-payment fee in the treatment phase is $150 per consultation.
Note 5: Percentages may not add up to 100 per cent due to rounding.
Note 6: Three FDs set co-payment fee at $0.
Note 7: 370 FDs set co-payment fee at $150.
Note 8: The highest co-payment fee is $800.

  The Government will strengthen the dual-track, complementary and collaborative model of public and private primary healthcare by providing chronic disease screening and management through private sector FDs and the district health network to the public on a co-payment basis. At the same time, the Government will reposition the HA's GOPCs to provide comprehensive primary healthcare services specifically for the underprivileged group. To underscore the direction of primary healthcare development, the HA will unify its GOPC and FMSC services under the new name of FMOP Services within this year. The Government will also adopt a primary healthcare service model to gradually integrate suitable patients under the GOPC PPP into the CDCC Pilot Scheme for continued care.

(4) The Government considered a wide range of factors when determining the subsidy amount for the CDCC Pilot Scheme, including market prices, affordability of the public, service demand and options, as well as the attractiveness of the Scheme.

  The core service of the CDCC Pilot Scheme is chronic disease management, and the content of the service should not vary depending on whether the FD has specialist qualifications or not. Under the existing system, participating FDs may set their own co-payment fee based on the content of their services. The Government completed the preliminary review of the CDCC Pilot Scheme in March 2024 and has introduced a number of improvement measures based on the results of the review, including allowing participating FDs (regardless of specialists or general practitioners) to set a co-payment fee of $120 or less in the screening phase, and to determine the consultation co-payment fee during the treatment phase on their own. The relevant fees can be adjusted once annually according to the established mechanism. The Government will reconsider the subsidy arrangement if there is a difference in the designated services provided by specialists and general practitioners under the CDCC Pilot Scheme in future.

  The Government has uploaded a list of all participating FDs, along with their basic information (including practice locations and participation in other Government-subsidised primary healthcare programmes (such as the Elderly Health Care Voucher Scheme)) and their designated consultation co-payment fees during the screening phase and treatment phase onto the dedicated website for the CDCC Pilot Scheme, to allow the public to compare clearly and make informed choices. The Government encourages participants to make good use of the information on the dedicated website. Staff at District Health Centres/Expresses can also provide assistance. The Government will continue to monitor the implementation of the Scheme to ensure that the fee mechanism protects the interests of the public while reasonably reflecting the value of medical professional services, and will consider enhancing and refining the relevant mechanism as necessary.

(5) The CDCC Pilot Scheme currently focuses on the screening and management of the ""three highs"" (i.e. high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol). Participants who are found to have ""three highs"" problems, as well as other health problems (e.g. thyroid dysfunction) or other medical conditions through the tests of the Scheme, can receive treatment for both the target chronic diseases and episodic illnesses concurrently at any of the subsidised consultations during the treatment phase. The CDCC Pilot Scheme has a basic-tier drug list covering the drugs for treating the ""three highs"" and for episodic illnesses (e.g. antibiotics and drugs for treating associated health problems). Under Government subsidy, participants prescribed with the drugs on the list will not be required to pay for such medication. The Government encourages participants to maintain a long-term relationship with their paired FD, who will follow up with them on their health status, including treatment of diseases other than DM,HT and hyperlipidaemia.

  The Government will regularly review the scope of primary healthcare services and the CDCC Pilot Scheme service scope based on considerations such as scientific evidence and resource utilisation, with a view to promoting multidisciplinary care and providing wider coverage and better continuity of healthcare services for Scheme participants. In the long run, the CDCC Pilot Scheme will gradually expand to cover more target diseases and health conditions. Related support services include a comprehensive network of nursing, allied health, pharmacy, laboratory, pharmaceutical and radiological diagnostics services.

(6) The CDCC Pilot Scheme has built in a doctor-patient partnership incentive mechanism with a view to encouraging FDs and participants to actively engage in the treatment process. All participants who have achieved certain health incentive targets (such as having their health indexes monitored and subsequently uploaded to the eHealth mobile application, attended follow-up consultations regularly, completed health education programmes or undergone laboratory investigations as advised) will enjoy a reduction of co-payment fee with a maximum amount of $150 (Note 9) for their first subsidised consultation in the following participant programme year. FDs who fulfil the pre-requisite requirements (i.e. meeting a pre-defined percentage of patients who achieved targets in regulating their levels of blood sugar and blood pressure) can also receive corresponding incentive payments (Note 10).

  The assessment of the incentive mechanism will start from the second participant programme year of Scheme participants upon entering the treatment phase. Since the CDCC Pilot Scheme has only been implemented for a year and a half, no Scheme participant has completed the full assessment cycle, hence the number and proportion of participants who have reached the targets are not available at this stage. The Government will analyse the effectiveness of the incentive mechanism after the first batch of participants have completed their second participant programme year.

Note 1: The CDCC Pilot Scheme screened for DM and HT in the initial phase (before March 28, 2025), and was later expanded to include blood lipid screening. Therefore, some of the participants who completed the screening were screened for DM and HT only, while the rest were screened for the ""three highs"".

Note 2: Prediabetes with glycated haemoglobin level of 6.0 to 6.4 per cent or fasting plasma glucose level of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L.

Note 9: The Government recommended consultation co-payment fee in the treatment phase.

Note 10: The calculation of incentive payment is 15 per cent of the total amount derived from the number of actual attendance of the subsidised consultations by the patients who have achieved their targets, the Government consultation subsidy and the recommended co-payment fee."

立法會四題：進口貓狗的檢疫安排,2025-06-11 16:08,2025-06-11 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100447.htm,"以下是今日（六月十一日）在立法會會議上梁美芬議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的答覆︰

問題：

漁農自然護理署於本月更新貓狗檢疫安排，從內地進口貓狗如符合相關檢疫規定（包括在獲認可的內地化驗所進行的檢測結果合格及持有由內地官方獸醫簽發的動物衞生證書），抵港後檢疫期會由現時的120天縮減至30天。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於進口貓狗現時須於指定檢疫設施進行檢疫，當局會否考慮引入彈性檢疫模式，例如全程居家檢疫，或「前15天於檢疫設施及後15天居家檢疫」的混合模式，以減輕動物主人的經濟負擔及提升設施使用效率；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，檢疫期縮短後，進口貓狗數量可能顯著增加，政府有否評估本港檢疫設施及獲認可的內地化驗所數目是否足以應付需求，以及當局如何確保有關檢測質量；及

（三）鑑於有意見指出，內地與香港的寵物貓狗存在顯著價格差異，更新檢疫安排或長遠增加本港飼養寵物家庭數目，政府有否評估，本港的動物醫療設備、診所及醫院是否足夠？

答覆：

主席：

狂犬病是一種可引致哺乳類動物（包括人類）死亡的傳染病，目前未有針對狂犬病的治療方法。為預防狂犬病等動物疾病傳入香港，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）採用許可證制度規管活生動物進口，並根據《公眾衞生（動物及禽鳥）規例》（第139A章）和《狂犬病規例》（第421A章）管制進口香港的貓狗，以保障香港市民和動物的健康。在有效的管制下，香港一直被其他地區廣泛認可為非狂犬病地區。香港的動物進入其他地區時一般可以獲得較寬鬆的檢疫要求。

就進口貓狗的檢疫安排，漁護署參考了世界動物衞生組織的動物疫情監控情況，並根據狂犬病出現的風險將各地區分成不同組別。第一組別和第二組別分別為非狂犬病地區和有零星狂犬病個案但疫情受到有效監控的地區。由於這些地區的狂犬病風險較低，進口的貓狗如能符合指定要求可豁免接受檢疫。至於未能符合第一或第二組別要求，或未能作出評估的地區，會被納入第三組別，從這些地區進口的貓狗，在二○二四年十二月以前全部都須接受不少於120天的檢疫。

自二○二四年十二月起，漁護署已根據風險評估結果把第三組別細分為A和B組。從第三A組別進口的貓狗只要符合檢疫規定，包括注射預防狂犬病疫苗、進行狂犬病抗體滴度檢測、持有出口地區政府獸醫師簽發或加簽的健康證明書等，檢疫期由以往抵港後120天大幅縮減至30天。澳門特別行政區、立陶宛和內地已先後納入第三A組別。至於第三B組別地區，由於狂犬病的風險較高或不明，而且狂犬病的潛伏期可長達數月，從該些地區進口貓狗的檢疫期維持不少於120天。

就梁美芬議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）剛才提到，由新增的第三A組別地區（包括內地）進口的貓狗只要符合相關檢疫規定，並持有由內地官方獸醫簽發的動物衞生證書，抵港後檢疫期由120天大幅縮減至30天。因為這個改變，該些貓狗主人須支付檢疫設施的費用大減至以往的四分之一，同時檢疫設施的流轉速度亦提高至以往的四倍，輪候時間相應減少，使用效率明顯提升。

至於檢疫模式，現行的國際做法是將貓狗置於官方監管的檢疫中心進行隔離檢疫，以確保動物在隔離期間不會與其他動物直接或間接接觸，從而避免動物疾病傳入社區。由於狂犬病病發後的死亡率接近100%，而動物在私人處所進行隔離時有機會與其他人或動物接觸，會為他們帶來較高風險。因此從風險管理角度而言，居家檢疫的安排並不合適。署方會繼續參考世界動物衞生組織公布的動物疫病最新情況，考慮各相關因素，包括國際做法、運作經驗、風險評估等，適時優化進口貓狗檢疫要求。

（二）為便利動物主人攜帶寵物貓狗來港，政府除了優化貓狗檢疫規定之外，同時亦增加了檢疫設施的數目。漁護署轄下的九龍動物管理中心新增的檢疫設施已在今年五月投入服務，為貓隻和狗隻提供的檢疫設施已由21個和20個，分別增至34個和30個。再計算因為縮短檢疫時讓流轉速度加快至以往的四倍，漁護署檢疫設施的處理能力可增加至以往的六到七倍之多。此外，漁護署亦鼓勵私營動物福利機構提供貓狗檢疫設施，並正審批香港愛護動物協會的申請，預計該檢疫設施可於本年年中投入服務。署方亦會向其他有意營辦貓狗檢疫設施的私營動物福利機構提供資訊和協助。因上述種種改善措施，預期檢疫設施可應付需求。

至於獲認可內地化驗室的數量和檢測質量，漁護署經過與內地當局商討，並且考慮化驗室在內地的地區分布和認證水平後，認可了四間位於北京、上海、廣州和長春的內地化驗室為貓狗進行狂犬病抗體滴度測試。四間化驗室均獲內地當局和歐盟（歐洲聯盟）認證，因此檢測質量有保證。漁護署會密切監察情況，有需要時會與內地當局商討更新認可化驗室名單。

（三）香港獸醫管理局是根據《獸醫註冊條例》（第529章）成立的法定機構，負責獸醫的規管、註冊及紀律監管，確保本港獸醫護理服務維持於高水平。獸醫管理局透過規管獸醫而收集的資料，了解獸醫服務的整體情況。

自二○一五年起，註冊獸醫的數目持續上升，由二○一五年的823名增加至今年四月的1 364名，升幅達65%。此外，註冊獸醫涵蓋眾多專科資格，例如小型動物的內外科、皮膚科、心臟科、腦神經科、獸醫病理學等。除了私人獸醫診所，香港城市大學和一些動物福利組織，如香港愛護動物協會，亦有提供獸醫服務，因此動物主人應能為其寵物找到合適的獸醫服務。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Quarantine arrangements for imported cats and dogs,2025-06-11 16:08,2025-06-11 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100454.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon Priscilla Leung and a reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has updated the quarantine arrangements for cats and dogs this month. Cats and dogs imported from the Mainland that meet the relevant quarantine requirements (including obtaining satisfactory results from testing conducted by recognised laboratories on the Mainland and having an animal health certificate issued by Mainland official veterinarians) will have their quarantine period significantly reduced from the current 120 days to 30 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that imported cats and dogs are currently required to be quarantined at designated quarantine facilities, whether the authorities will consider introducing a flexible mode of quarantine, e.g. home quarantine for the entire period, or a mixed mode involving ""quarantine at a facility for the first 15 days and home quarantine for the remaining 15 days"", with a view to relieving the financial burden on animal owners and enhancing the efficiency on the use of facilities;

(2) as there are views that the numbers of imported cats and dogs may increase significantly after the quarantine period is reduced, whether the Government has assessed if the numbers of quarantine facilities in Hong Kong and recognised laboratories on the Mainland are sufficient to cope with the demand, and how the authorities will ensure the quality of the relevant testing; and

(3) as there are views pointing out that there is a significant price difference between pet cats and dogs on the Mainland and in Hong Kong, and that updating the quarantine arrangements may increase the numbers of pet-keeping households in Hong Kong in the long run, whether the Government has assessed if there are sufficient veterinary equipment, clinics and hospitals in Hong Kong?

Reply:

President,

 Rabies is a contagious disease that causes fatality to mammals (including humans) and no specific treatment is available at present. To prevent the introduction of animal diseases such as rabies into Hong Kong, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) regulates the import of live animals through a permit system, and controls the import of cats and dogs under the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations (Cap. 139A) and the Rabies Regulation (Cap. 421A) to protect public and animal health. Under effective control measures, Hong Kong has long been widely recognised as a rabies-free place by other places. Animals of Hong Kong generally face less stringent quarantine requirements when entering other places.

 On the quarantine arrangements of imported cats and dogs, the AFCD classifies places into different groups according to different risk of rabies, with reference to information about the surveillance of animal diseases from the World Organisation for Animal Health. Group I and Group II places are respectively rabies-free places and places where rabies cases are few and under effective control. Since these places are considered of lower risk of rabies, the imported cats and dogs are exempted from quarantine upon fulfilling specified requirements. Places that do not meet the requirements of Group I or Group II, or where their situations cannot be determined, will be included in Group III. Cats and dogs imported from these places are required to undergo a quarantine of not less than 120 days before December 2024.

 Since December 2024, the AFCD has divided Group III into Group A and B according to the results of risk assessment. Quarantine period for cats and dogs of Group IIIA is significantly shortened from 120 days to 30 days upon their arrival in Hong Kong, provided that they meet the relevant quarantine requirements including that the animals must be vaccinated against rabies, conducted a valid rabies neutralising antibody titre test, had an animal health certificate issued or endorsed by a government veterinary officer of the place of export. The Macao Special Administrative Region, Lithuania and the Mainland have been included in Group IIIA successively. As regards Group IIIB places, since the risk of rabies is higher or uncertain, and the incubation period of rabies can be up to several months, the quarantine period for cats and dogs imported from those places is maintained at not less than 120 days.

 The reply to the question from Professor the Hon Priscilla Leung is as follows:

(1) As mentioned just now, as long as cats and dogs imported from the newly added Group IIIA places (including the Mainland) meet the relevant quarantine requirements and hold an animal health certificate issued by an official veterinarian from the Mainland, the quarantine period upon arrival in Hong Kong will be significantly reduced from 120 days to 30 days. Because of this change, the cost of quarantine facilities that the owners of these cats and dogs have to pay has been greatly reduced to one-quarter of the previous cost, at the same time, the turnover rate of quarantine facilities will increase to four times than that of the past. The waiting time for quarantine facilities will be reduced correspondingly, and the usage effectiveness will be increased significantly.

 As regards the quarantine arrangements, the current international practice is to isolate cats and dogs in officially supervised quarantine facilities to ensure that the animals will not have direct or indirect contact with other animals during the quarantine period, so as to avoid the transmission of animal disease into the community. As the mortality rate of rabies is close to 100 per cent, and animals have the opportunity to come into contact with other people or animals when they are quarantined in private premises, this will bring to them higher risk. Hence from a risk management perspective, home quarantine arrangement is not appropriate. The Department will continue to make reference to the latest animal disease situation announced by the World Organisation for Animal Health, and timely optimise the quarantine requirements for imported cats and dogs, taking into account factors such as international practices, operational experience and risk assessment.

(2) To facilitate animal owners to bring their pet cats and dogs to Hong Kong, the Government has not only optimised the quarantine requirements for cats and dogs, but also increased the number of quarantine facilities. The new quarantine facilities at the Kowloon Animal Management Centre under the AFCD have been put into service in May this year. The quarantine facilities provided for cats and dogs have increased from 21 and 20 to 34 and 30 respectively. Further, taking into account that the shortened quarantine period has increased the turnover speed to four times than that of the past, the handling capacity of the AFCD's quarantine facilities could be increased by as much as six to seven times than that of the past. In addition, the AFCD encourages private animal welfare organisations to provide quarantine facilities for cats and dogs, and is reviewing the application of the Hong Kong Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). It is expected that the quarantine facility will be put into service in the middle of this year. The Department will also provide information and assistance to other private animal welfare organisations interested in operating quarantine facilities for cats and dogs. On the basis of the above improvement measures, it is expected that the quarantine facilities will be able to meet the demand.

 As regards the number and testing quality of recognised Mainland laboratories, after discussions with the Mainland authorities and taking into account the regional distribution and level of recognition of the laboratories in the Mainland, the AFCD has recognised four Mainland laboratories in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Changchun for conducting rabies antibody titre tests for cats and dogs. All four laboratories are recognised by the Mainland authorities and the European Union, hence the quality of testing is assured. The AFCD will closely monitor the situation and will discuss with the Mainland authorities to adjust the list of approved laboratories when necessary.

(3) The Veterinary Surgeons Board of Hong Kong (VSB) is a statutory body established under the Veterinary Surgeons Registration Ordinance (Cap. 529), and is responsible for the regulation, registration and disciplinary control of veterinary surgeons, to ensure a high standard of veterinary services in Hong Kong. The VSB learns about the overall veterinary services through data gathered in the regulation of the veterinary profession.

 The number of registered veterinary surgeons (RVS) has been consistently on the rise since 2015, from 823 in 2015 to 1364 in April this year, representing an increase of 65 per cent. Moreover, RVS comprises many specialties, such as small animal internal medicine and surgery, dermatology, cardiology, neurology and veterinary pathology. Apart from private veterinary clinics, the City University of Hong Kong and some animal welfare organisations, such as the SPCA, also provide veterinary services, therefore animal owners should be able to find appropriate veterinary services for their pets.

 Thank you, President."

Question:

At present, the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates (IANG) adopt a ""2+3+3"" year mode of stay. It is learnt that earlier this year, some of those who were admitted to Hong Kong for employment through IANG (e.g. those whose employment contracts were about to expire) were unable to obtain three-year visa renewals smoothly when extending their stay. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of first applications for IANG and applications for extension of stay under IANG received, approved and rejected by the Immigration Department (ImmD), as well as the number of persons who were admitted to Hong Kong as dependants under IANG in the past three years;

(2) of the following information on the full-time employment of the persons who have been granted IANG visas and their dependants mentioned in (1): (i) the major industries and job types in which they are engaged, and (ii) the highest, lowest and median amounts of monthly salaries;

(3) whether it has assessed the long-term effectiveness of IANG in attracting and retaining talent; if it has assessed, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether ImmD has made any adjustment to the vetting and approval of applications for extension of stay by IANG visa holders at present; if so, of the details; if not, why some IANG visa holders have relayed that their applications for extension of stay have only been granted for a few months; and

(5) whether it has considered providing transitional support (e.g. arranging short-term accommodation and setting up a dedicated recruitment website, etc) for persons who have just been granted IANG visas in the future, so as to assist them in adapting the live in Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Applicants who are/were non-local students and have obtained an undergraduate or higher qualification in a full-time and locally-accredited programme in Hong Kong may apply to stay/return and work in Hong Kong under the Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates (IANG). The Government has extended the IANG on a pilot basis to cover graduates with a bachelor's degree or higher qualification from Hong Kong universities' campuses in Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

After consultation with the Immigration Department and the Labour and Welfare Bureau, our consolidated replies to Dr the Hon Dennis Lam's questions are as follows:

(1) The numbers of applications received, approved and refused under the IANG in the past three years are tabulated below:

Note: Applications approved/refused in a year may not all be received in the same year.

(2) At present, over 90 per cent of those coming to or staying in Hong Kong under the IANG are fresh graduates. They are not required to have secured offers of employment in Hong Kong upon application. However, when applying for an extension of stay, they are required to have taken up employment in Hong Kong that are at the levels commonly taken up by degree holders and the remuneration packages are on par with the market level. For those who have established or joined in business in Hong Kong, they are required to produce proof of their business upon application for an extension of stay.

The breakdown of the numbers of approved applications for an extension of stay under the IANG by industry/sector is tabulated below:

The Immigration Department does not maintain other breakdowns of statistics mentioned in the question.

(3) Since its launch in 2008, the IANG has received positive response and helped Hong Kong attract and retain talent as well as expanding the talent pool. As at the end of April 2025, a total of 177 567 applications have been received. Among them, 172 043 applications have been approved, with over 90 per cent being recent non-local graduates and 2 825 applications coming from the graduates of the GBA campuses of Hong Kong universities. The statistics on entrants admitted to Hong Kong under the IANG who eventually acquired the right of abode in the past five years are tabulated as follows:

4 441
4 128




Note: The figures are based on the applicants' status in Hong Kong at the time of application for the right of abode.

With the development of the GBA, it has become a trend for Hong Kong universities to set up campuses in Mainland cities of the GBA through joint ventures, and their graduates will become an important source of talent in the GBA. Starting from the end of 2022, the Government has extended the IANG on a pilot basis to cover graduates with a bachelor's degree or higher qualification from Hong Kong universities' campuses in Mainland cities of the GBA, so as to attract outstanding talent from these institutions to come to Hong Kong for employment and further boost Hong Kong's human resources and competitiveness. The Chief Executive announced in his Policy Address 2024 to extend the pilot arrangement for two years. This measure not only fosters the exchange of talents in the GBA, but also meets the needs of economic development in the GBA. We will continue to monitor the implementation of the IANG, particularly the response to the inclusion of graduates of Hong Kong universities' GBA campuses under the IANG, and review its effectiveness in due course.

(4) Upon applying for an extension of stay by persons admitted under the IANG, non-local graduates/GBA campus graduates are required to have taken up employment in Hong Kong which is at a level commonly taken up by degree holders and the remuneration package is at the market level. For those who have established or joined in a business in Hong Kong, they are required to produce proof of their business. When assessing an application for an extension of stay, various factors related to the applicant's employment or business conditions will be considered, including but not limited to the remuneration package or the operation and development of the business, the economic benefits brought by the employment or business, and the duration of stay in Hong Kong, etc. Successful applicants will normally be granted an extension of stay on time limitation only without other conditions of stay for not more than three years, or until the expiry of their employment contract in Hong Kong, whichever is the shorter. For those who have established or joined in a business in Hong Kong, the length of their extension of stay to be granted will be determined based on the comprehensive consideration of the operating conditions of the relevant business.

(5) Since its establishment on October 30, 2023, the Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) has been providing comprehensive one-stop support to talents coming to or staying in Hong Kong under various talent admission schemes (including the IANG) through both online and offline means. Apart from providing comprehensive information on living and working in Hong Kong as well as handling enquiries from outside talent through its online platform (www.hkengage.gov.hk), the HKTE organises with working partners a variety of online and offline activities such as job fairs, themed seminars, workshops (including Cantonese learning classes) and social integration activities (including the Talent+ Volunteer Programme) to share information on entrepreneurship, employment as well as other living tips and to facilitate the incoming talent to settle in Hong Kong and integrate into the city as soon as possible. The online platform features about 5 000 real-time quality job opportunities daily for which talent can apply directly through the platform. Moreover, the online platform is connected to about 90 designated working partners of the HKTE to provide recommendations and services in areas such as job seeking, accommodation, education, integrated settlement, banking and insurance, business and corporate as well as networking and community, etc through online matching tools."

註︰數目按申請人申請居留權時的居港身分劃分。

隨着大灣區的發展，香港的大學在大灣區內地城市透過合作辦學模式設立校園已漸成趨勢，其畢業生亦將成為區內人才的重要泉源。政府自二○二二年年底開始，以試行形式擴展「安排」至涵蓋本港大學大灣區內地城市校園的學士學位或更高資歷畢業生，吸引院校培養的優秀人才來港就業，進一步提升香港的人力資源及競爭力。《行政長官2024年施政報告》宣布有關措施將繼續試行兩年。此舉亦有助促進大灣區內人才流通，配合區內經濟發展所需。我們會繼續留意計劃的實施情況，尤其是把大灣區內地城市校園畢業生納入「安排」的反應，適時檢視其成效。

（四）根據「安排」獲准來港的人士提出延長逗留期限申請時，非本地畢業生╱大灣區校園畢業生均須已在港受聘，而從事的工作須通常是由學位持有人擔任，及其薪酬福利條件亦須達到市場水平。申請人如已在香港開辦或參與任何業務，則須出示其業務的證明文件。延長逗留期限申請的審批會按申請人的就業或業務情況考慮各項因素，包括但不限於薪酬福利或業務的營運及發展、工作或業務帶來的經濟效益，以及留港的時間等。申請如獲批准，申請人一般可獲准延長逗留不多於三年，或至其在港的僱傭合約的有效期限屆滿，以較短者為準，而不受其他逗留條件限制。對於已在香港開辦或參與業務的人士，其獲准延長逗留期限的長短，將綜合相關業務的經營情況作出考慮。

（五）香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）自二○二三年十月三十日成立以來，一直以線上及線下形式，為不同人才入境計劃（包括「安排」）下來港或留港的人才提供全方位一站式支援。除設有線上平台（www.hkengage.gov.hk）提供有關在港生活及工作的全方位資訊，以及處理人才的查詢外，人才辦與合作夥伴舉辦多元化的線上線下活動，包括招聘會、專題研討會、工作坊（包括粤語學習班），以及社區共融活動（包括人才義工計劃），提供有關不同生活範疇、就業及創業等方面的資訊，協助來港人才落戶香港，以及盡快融入香港生活。線上平台更每日實時展示市場上優質招聘崗位約5 000個，人才可直接經由平台申請職位。此外，線上平台連繫約90家指定合作夥伴，提供網上支援配對服務，在求職、住房、教育、綜合移居、銀行及保險服務、商務及企業服務和社群網絡等方面為人才提供建議和服務。"

主席：

我現在提出七項政府修正案，修正《2025年建築物能源效益（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）第3、6、16、17和19條，以及新增第7A條。修正案內容已載列於早前由立法會秘書處發送予各位議員的文件內。七項修正案按內容大致可歸納為三組，我現作扼要介紹：

（一）「數據中心」的定義

第一組修正案旨在優化《條例草案》中「數據中心」的定義。我們建議修改《條例草案》第3條，說明「數據中心」的定義為「主要為提供數據儲存、數據處理及分發服務而在安全及受控制的環境放置和操作電腦系統、伺服器、電訊設備及相關支援組件的地方」，並於附註中列出相關支援組件的例子。經修正後的定義説明了「數據中心」應該包含的元素，並排除了純粹用作貯存有關設備的地方和只存放上述任何一種設備的地方。

（二）指明建築物擁有人及／或相關政府部門首長在豁免進行能源審核的條件不再適用時須予跟進的事項

第二組修正案的目的，是指明建築物擁有人及／或相關政府部門首長在豁免進行能源審核的條件不再適用時須予跟進的事項。《條例草案》第6條設有條款，容許機電署（機電工程署）署長應政府某部門首長的書面意見，以維護國家安全為由豁免建築物進行能源審核。因應法律顧問和法案委員會就豁免實際操作提出的意見，政府全盤檢視了《條例》第4部的現有和擬議新增豁免進行能源審核的條款，並建議在《條例草案》新增第7A條，闡述相關要求，包括：

（a）相關擁有人及／或政府部門首長須向機電署署長送交書面通知；

（b）在豁免條件不再適用後的12個月內，相關擁有人須安排就該建築物的中央屋宇裝備裝置進行能源審核；

（c）機電署署長可應擁有人的書面申請延長進行能源審核的期限；以及

（d）違反這項能源審核規定的罪行和適用罰則。

（三）技術性及草擬行文修訂

最後一組修正案屬於技術和草擬行文修訂。首先是刪除《條例草案》第6條中就「國家安全」定義的提述。根據律政司的最新法律意見，「國家安全」一詞的涵義已在《釋義及通則條例》（第1章）第3條中界定，該詞的涵義與《條例草案》中的提述相同，因此無需重覆界定。這項技術修訂對《條例草案》和經修訂《建築物能源效益條例》（《條例》）的法律效力並無影響。

其次是《條例草案》第16和17條關於「社區建築物用途而佔用的建築物」和「市政建築物用途而佔用的建築物」的雙語表述。因應法案委員會的建議，政府將提出行文修訂，使這些詞彙的文意更暢達易明。

最後，政府建議就《條例草案》第19條作相應技術修訂，以配合對第3條中「數據中心」的定義。

法案委員會對上述七項修正案並無異議，我懇請各委員支持及通過修正案。"

主席：

《2025年建築物能源效益（修訂）條例草案》今日得以恢復二讀辯論，我衷心感謝法案委員會主席盧偉國議員的領導、委員會其他議員的支持，以及立法會秘書處的努力，讓《條例草案》的審議工作得以高效、順利進行。我亦十分感謝剛才發言的14位議員提出的意見及大家對《條例草案》的支持。

修例目的

《條例草案》的主要目的，是加強本港建築物的能源效益管理制度。目前，香港約90%電力用於建築物，超過50%的碳排放來自與建築物耗能相關的電力生產。因此，提高建築物能源效益對達致節能減碳的目的十分重要。目前，《建築物能源效益條例》（第610章）（《條例》）已規管建築物在新建或進行主要裝修工程時，其屋宇裝備裝置必須符合訂明的能源效益標準，而商業建築物亦須每隔不多於10年進行一次能源審核，從而發掘和落實節能機會。

《條例》由二○一二年九月實施至今，已有超過2 300幢新建建築物和超過15 000項現有建築物的主要裝修工程符合能源效益標準，另有約2 700幢建築物完成首次能源審核，其中超過一半更已完成第二次能源審核。

《條例草案》的主要建議

參考《條例》的執行經驗，政府建議循以下五個範疇修訂《條例》，進一步提升本港建築物能源效益：

（一）把數據中心全面納入建築物能源效益標準的規管範圍：目前《條例》已規管位於商業樓宇內數據中心的能源效益標準，但尚未覆蓋獨棟數據中心和由工業大廈部分改建的數據中心。考慮到這些數據中心的用電量甚高，且將會有越來越多數據中心落成，我們將獨棟數據中心和由工業大廈部分改建的數據中心的新建和主要裝修工程納入建築物能源效益標準的規管範圍，即把《條例》相關部分所涵蓋的建築物類型由13類增加至15類；

（二）要求更多類型的建築物定期進行能源審核：根據機電工程署就已進行第二次能源審核建築物的數據，這些建築物的能源使用指數平均較首次能源審核時下降了20%，顯示能源審核有助促進建築物節能。因此，我們要求更多類別的建築物定期進行能源審核，包括用作政府辦公室、教育、社區、市政、醫療及健康護理服務等用途的建築物，即是將《條例》要求須定期進行能源審核的建築物類型由兩類增加至11類。

另一方面，因應在諮詢期內所收到的意見，我們建議除數據中心外，豁免總樓面面積不超過7 000平方米（即約75 000呎）的中小型建築物進行能源審核，以平衡經濟效益和規管目的；

（三）將能源審核的周期由現時的10年縮短至五年：為鼓勵現有建築物更適時採用綠色節能設備和技術，以更全面發揮能源審核的益處，我們將能源審核的周期由現時的10年縮短至五年，讓我們的安排與鄰近地區，例如內地、新加坡和日本東京相若；

（四）公開能源審核報告中若干技術資料：例如主要屋宇裝備裝置的能源效益系數和節能潛力，提高數據的透明度；以及

（五）擴大符合註冊為「註冊能源效益評核人」的資格：我們把能源界別工程師和香港合資格環保專業人員學會的專業會員納入為符合註冊「註冊能源效益評核人」的資格。這將增加可成為「註冊能源效益評核人」的人數，滿足進行能源審核的新需求，有助實施經修訂的《條例》。

《條例草案》在獲得立法會通過並全面實施後，估計到二○三五年將每年額外節省五億度電，相當於15萬個三人家庭的每年用電量。

未來，我們會持續檢視《條例草案》的實施情況，按實際條件逐步將更多類型的建築物和數據納入能源審核。我們亦會研究如何加強對業界的支持。

諮詢及立法會工作

我們早於二○二三年十一月起就《條例草案》作廣泛諮詢，包括行業商會、物業管理業界、建造業界、專業團體、公共服務機構和其他持份者。我們也分別徵詢能源諮詢委員會、碳中和及可持續發展委員會和環境諮詢委員會的意見，並於今年一月徵詢立法會環境事務委員會的意見。持份者和事務委員會均普遍支持修訂建議。

自我們在三月二十六日將《條例草案》於立法會首讀以來，法案委員會於今年四月至五月期間舉行了兩次會議審議《條例草案》，從政策原意、現行條例實施情況、法律草擬等多方面深入探討，並提出許多寶貴的意見。政府經審慎考慮後，採納委員不少的建議，並將就此提出修正案，讓法律條文更為清晰易明。我稍後會在全體委員會階段說明修正案的內容。

落實時間表

《條例草案》如今天獲得立法會通過，我們將會在《憲報》刊登生效日期公告，分兩階段落實修訂：即先在二○二五年九月，即《條例》刊憲後的三個月後更新「註冊能源效益評核人」註冊的認可資格，並在二○二六年九月，即《條例》刊憲後的15個月實施其餘條文，以全面實施經修訂後的《條例》。

結語

主席，今次修訂《條例》可以達致三贏局面：一是為建築物節省電費、二是減少碳排放、三是促進綠色經濟發展，助力香港在二○五○年前實現碳中和。我謹此陳辭，懇請各位議員支持及通過《條例草案》。"

據報，隨着港珠澳大橋（大橋）香港口岸人工島自動化停車場於年底落成，當局計劃最快今年底起分階段實施「粵車南下」，有關計劃設有配額，獲配額的粵車在首階段只可停泊在大橋香港口岸的自動化停車場，旅客可無須辦理入境手續直接到香港國際機場禁區乘機離港，或經大橋香港口岸入境香港後，轉乘其他交通工具進入市區。「粵車南下」第二階段才開放粵車進入市區。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）分兩個階段實施「粵車南下」的原因為何；會否考慮將兩個階段合併推行，以回應各界加快吸引自駕遊旅客的訴求；

（二）會否就車流量較大的市區個別地段，劃定粵車禁區，以及會否因應周末、周日和香港假期時，市區交通相對稀疏及暢順，加大「粵車南下」的每日配額；及

（三）有否評估，「粵車南下」全面實施後為本港帶來的經濟效益為何？

答覆：

主席：

粵港雙方一直致力推動各項跨境通行措施，共同建設粵港澳大灣區（大灣區），並用好港珠澳大橋（大橋）。「港車北上」自二○二三年七月成功推出，允許合資格的香港單牌私家車可在內地海關免擔保政策下，只需作簡單預約便可以自駕方式經大橋到廣東省各個商業中心、鄉郊地區、旅遊熱點等作短期商務、探親或旅遊，讓香港旅客赴粵的出行規劃更為方便。北上的香港私家車數目正節節上升，已有超過10萬輛曾參加「港車北上」；大橋的使用量亦屢創新高，今年五月的雙向車流量達45萬車次，即每日平均約15 000車次，比「港車北上」未實施前上升約170%；其中按「港車北上」出行的車輛佔大橋車流約四成，即每日平均約6 000車次。同時，為回應市民雙向奔赴的殷切期盼，為內地訪客來港提供多元化體驗，我們正與內地有關部門積極籌劃「粵車南下」實施安排。

就黎棟國議員提問的三個部分，我現答覆如下：

（一）「港車北上」的推展經驗，為粵港規劃「粵車南下」提供實際和具體的參考。粵港政府持續監察市民的申請和出行體驗，相繼推出優化安排，包括每日接受申請數目由最初200宗逐漸增加至現時500宗；車輛查驗中心由最初一間增加至現時三間；擴闊每個預約出行時段，並推遲「最後預約」和「取消預約」的期限等。粵港也共同提升大橋口岸通關暢達度，以應對大橋持續上升的車流。而廣東各地亦陸續推出便利「港車北上」車輛的配套設施與宣傳。

「粵車南下」作為「港車北上」的反向互惠安排，合資格的廣東私家車也可在無需取得常規配額，以及在已提前預約的條件下，經大橋到香港作短期商務、探親或旅遊。綜觀「港車北上」的經驗，我們需要穩妥推行「粵車南下」，同時提速提效。我們早前已公布鄰近大橋香港口岸的兩個自動化停車場會作為「粵車南下」的一部分，供廣東及澳門私家車經大橋來港停泊。將車輛停泊「轉機停車場」的旅客可到香港國際機場轉乘飛機，進一步便利大灣區旅客經香港往來全球各地，鞏固香港作為國際航空樞紐的領先地位；而停泊「訪港停車場」的旅客則可到大橋旅檢大樓辦理入境手續，為訪港旅客提供多一個選項，有利於兩地人員流通，提供經濟動力。目前，政府及機管局（香港機場管理局）正積極進行啓用前的預備工作，包括進行測試和演習、制訂預約和使用細則，目標是盡量簡化流程，為旅客提供最大方便。此外，我們正在籌劃宣傳工作及優惠，以吸引自駕旅客，帶動本港的零售、餐飲、酒店及相關服務業。

（二）與此同時，我們亦正與廣東攜手為粵車入境香港市區作預早準備。我們在不同方面包括總量控制、口岸通關、風險管理、提升配套設施等着手，予以周全考慮。一方面評估口岸交通和道路的承載力，引導車流避免尖峰，以及強化口岸過關和交通配備和預案；另一方面妥善管理風險，例如要求南下的車輛依據香港的法規，確保車輛安全性和購買香港第三者保險；亦正制訂有關的申請程序、駕駛規則、配套設施等的宣傳資訊；希望在風險可控的前提下，簡化申請程序，為申請人提供便利。按照以上安排，「粵車南下」將達至有序推展、用家歡迎、市民安心、社會受惠，從而無需為粵車另設有關車輛的限制區域或道路。

（三）我們相信在有序推展和總量控制，以及配套措施到位的條件下，「粵車南下」能為旅客來港帶來便捷和具彈性的出行新選擇，可以按其所需，各適其適，進行旅遊、經商、出席展覽或會議、參加音樂會或其他大型活動、尋求各種專業服務和休閒飲食等，預期香港各行各業將會受惠；與「港車北上」產生的協同效應，亦將為粵港經濟及大灣區融合發展注入更大動能。

特區政府現正繼續與各內地相關部門積極制訂穩妥有序推展「粵車南下」的實施安排和時間表，我本人亦親自帶領團隊與廣東商討，務求爭取於今年內盡快公布細節。

多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles,2025-06-11 15:40,2025-06-11 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100473.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lai Tung-kwok and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

It is reported that following the completion of the automated car park on the Hong Kong Port Island of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) by the end of this year, the authorities plan to implement the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles in phases starting as early as the end of this year. The scheme runs with quotas and Guangdong vehicles allocated with quotas under the first phase will only be allowed to park at the automated car park at the HZMB Hong Kong Port. Passengers may proceed directly to the restricted area of Hong Kong International Airport and depart Hong Kong by plane without going through immigration clearance, or enter Hong Kong via the HZMB Hong Kong Port and then transfer to other modes of transport to reach the urban areas. Guangdong vehicles will only be allowed access to the urban areas under the second phase of the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the reasons for implementing the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles in two phases; whether it will consider implementing the two phases in one go by merging them, so as to address the calls from various sectors for attracting road trip visitors more expeditiously;

(2) whether it will designate no-entry zones for Guangdong vehicles in specific urban areas with heavier traffic, and whether it will increase the daily quota for the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles on weekends, Sundays, and Hong Kong public holidays when urban traffic is relatively light and smooth; and

(3) whether it has assessed the economic benefits brought to Hong Kong upon the full implementation of the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles?

Reply:

President,

Guangdong and Hong Kong have been committed to implementing various cross-boundary transport measures to jointly develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and to make good use of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB). Since the successful implementation of Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles (the Northbound Travel Scheme) in July 2023, eligible Hong Kong single-plate private cars are allowed to travel under the customs guarantee-free policy to various commercial centres, countryside, tourist hotspots, etc, in the Guangdong Province via the HZMB for business, visiting families or sight-seeing on a short-term basis upon making simple bookings; thus allowing greater convenience for Hong Kong travellers to plan their travel. The number of northbound Hong Kong private cars to the Guangdong Province has been on the rise, with over 100 000 private cars which have participated in the scheme. The usage of the HZMB has also recorded new highs, with its two-way vehicular flow reaching a total of 450 000 vehicles in May 2025 (i.e. a daily average of about 15 000 vehicles), representing an increase of about 170 per cent as compared to that before the implementation of the Northbound Travel Scheme; among which vehicles under the Northbound Travel Scheme account for about 40per cent of the HZMB's vehicular flow (i.e. a daily average of about 6 000 vehicles). Meanwhile, to meet the keen expectations of the public on two-way travel, and to provide diversified experiences for Mainland travellers to visit Hong Kong, we are actively working with the relevant Mainland authorities on the implementation arrangements for the Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles (the Southbound Travel Scheme).

In response to the three parts of the question raised by the Hon Lai Tung-kwok, my reply is as follows:

(1) The experience of implementing the Northbound Travel Scheme provides pragmatic and substantive reference for the planning of the Southbound Travel Scheme between Guangdong and Hong Kong. The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong have been monitoring the application and travel experience of the citizens in a bid to roll out a number of enhanced arrangements, which include gradually increasing the maximum number of applications received per day from 200 at the beginning to the current 500; increasing the number of vehicle inspection centres from one at the beginning to three at present; expanding the travel booking timeslots, while deferring the deadline of booking and cancellation of booking. Guangdong and Hong Kong have also worked together to enhance port clearance at the HZMB ports, so as to address the increasing vehicular flow of the HZMB. Meanwhile, various parts of Guangdong are successively providing ancillary facilities to facilitate the vehicles under the Northbound Travel Scheme and launching promotion.

As regards the Southbound Travel Scheme which is the reverse reciprocal arrangement of the Northbound Travel Scheme, eligible Guangdong private cars without regular quotas will also be allowed to travel to Hong Kong via the HZMB for business, visiting families or sight-seeing on a short-term basis under the condition that advance bookings have been made. Drawing on the experience from the Northbound Travel Scheme, we need to ensure that the Southbound Travel Scheme is taken forward in a prudent manner while enhancing speed and efficiency. We have earlier announced the two automated carparks near the HZMB Hong Kong Port as part of the Southbound Travel Scheme, where private cars from Guangdong and Macao can park when they come to Hong Kong via the HZMB. Visitors who park their cars at the ""Park and Fly"" carpark could transfer flight at Hong Kong International Airport, thereby further facilitates the transport of travellers of the GBA to and from all parts of the world via Hong Kong, as well as consolidate Hong Kong's position as a leading international aviation hub. Visitors who park at the ""Park and Visit"" carpark could go through immigration clearance at the passenger clearance building of the HZMB, which provides visitors to Hong Kong with an additional option, thereby promotes the flow of people between the two places and drives economic growth. At present, the Government and theAirport Authority Hong Kong are actively undertaking preparatory work for the commencement of operation, including conducting tests and drills, as well as formulating the details in respect of the booking and use of the carparks. Our objective is to streamline the procedures as far as possible to provide maximum convenience for travellers. In addition, we are planning promotional activities and discounts, with a view to attracting self-drive visitors, which will in turn stimulate the retail, food and beverage, hotel and related service sectors in Hong Kong.

(2) Meanwhile, we are also working with Guangdong to make early preparation for Guangdong vehicles to enter Hong Kong urban area. We are taking comprehensive consideration of various aspects, including total volume control, port clearance, risk management and enhancement of supporting facilities. On one hand, we will assess traffic at the port and the capacity of nearby roads, divert traffic away from peak hours, and strengthen port clearance as well as ancillary transport arrangements and contingency plans; on the other hand, we will properly manage the risks, such as requiring southbound vehicles to comply with the rules and regulations of Hong Kong to ensure the safety of their vehicles and take out a Hong Kong third party insurance. We are also formulating publicity information covering application procedures, driving rules and ancillary facilities. Where risks are controllable, we will streamline the application procedures and provide convenience for applicants. Following the above arrangements, the Southbound Travel Scheme will be implemented in orderly manner, welcomed by users, to the satisfaction of the public, and beneficial to the community at large; thereby obviating the need to impose restricted zones or roads for Guangdong vehicles.

(3) We believe that under the conditions of orderly implementation, total volume control, and appropriate supporting measures, the Southbound Travel Scheme will provide visitors with convenient and flexible new travel option to Hong Kong for travel, business, attending exhibitions or conferences, participating in concerts or other large-scale events, seeking various professional services, leisure and dining, etc, according to their need. It is expected that various industries in Hong Kong will benefit; and the synergy effect achieved with the Northbound Travel Scheme will also add extra impetus to the economies of Guangdong and Hong Kong, and the integration and development of the GBA.

The HKSAR Government is proactively working with respective Mainland authorities to formulate the implementation arrangements and timetable for taking forward the Southbound Travel Scheme in an orderly manner. I myself have also been leading a team to discuss with Guangdong side, with a view to striving for early announcement of the details of the scheme within this year.

Thank you, President."
LCQ11: Academic staff members of universities funded by University Grants Committee,2025-06-11 15:35,2025-06-11 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100403.htm,"Following is a question by Professor the Hon Chow Man-kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (June 11):

Question:

Regarding the academic staff members of universities funded by the University Grants Committee, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the numbers of newly-joined academic staff members (including but not limited to (i) senior academic staff, (ii) junior academic staff, (iii) academic supporting staff, (iv) administrative, technical and other staff, and (v) technical research staff) of the eight universities funded by the University Grants Committee (the eight universities) in each of the past three academic years, as well as their respective percentages in the academic staff members of the respective ranks, together with a breakdown by (A) university, (B) academic programme/department (including but not limited to (I) Medicine, Dentistry and Health, (II) Sciences and (III) Education and Continuing Education), and (C) background of relevant academic staff members (i.e. (a) holders of Hong Kong Permanent Identity Cards, and (b) holders of visas granted by the Immigration Department under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, General Employment Policy and Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates, etc);

(2) whether it knows the numbers of academic staff members of the eight universities who left the service (including but not limited to those mentioned in (i) to (v) in (1)) in each of the past three academic years, as well as their respective percentages in the academic staff members of the respective ranks, together with a breakdown by (A) to (C) mentioned in (1));

(3) regarding the departure situation mentioned in (2), whether it knows the reasons for departure of the academic staff members of the eight universities in each of the past three academic years (e.g. retirement, transfer to another local university, change of profession and other reasons), and whether it has analysed their departure trends, together with a breakdown by university; and

(4) as there are views that as the United States (US) has further tightened its visa policy on non-US academics as well as research and development (R&D) personnel, and the relevant countries in the European Union have also introduced measures one after another to ""trawl talent"", whether the authorities will introduce stronger and more effective measures to attract such people to engage in R&D work in Hong Kong, so as to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Our reply to Professor the Hon Chow Man-kong's question is as follows:

Hong Kong's overall competitiveness in education ranks among the top five in the world, and our post-secondary education is highly internationalised and diversified. To date, five University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities have been ranked among the top 100 in the world, six are ranked among the top 50 in Asia, a number of them have been ranked among the top universities in the world's most international universities ranking, and they have excellent research talent, which make them attractive to students and scholars from all over the world. The universities are recruiting globally following their institutional development strategies and their teaching and research needs, so as to continuously enhance their global competitiveness. Under the leadership of the Committee on Education, Technology and Talents led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Government will continue to promote Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent, co-ordinate and drive the integrated development of education, technology and talent, expand connections, formulate policies to attract and cultivate talent, and foster the co-ordinated development of technologies, so as to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international post-secondary education hub and an international innovation and technology centre.

Over the past years, with the Government's increased investment in higher education and the introduction of various support measures, the staff number in academic departments of the UGC-funded universities has increased by 4.5 per cent from 13 548 in the 2021/22 academic year (AY) to 14 161 in the 2023/24 AY, with an increase of 8.5 per cent in the number of senior and junior academic staff from 4 974 to 5 398. The number of leaving academic staff has also dropped from 399 to 378. Overall, Hong Kong's higher education institutions are proactively pursuing the goal of capacity expansion and quality enhancement, and have achieved certain success in recruiting and retaining talent.

The actual numbers of staff in the academic departments of universities by staff grade, university and departmental cost centre group are at Annex I. The numbers of senior/junior academic staff joining and leaving are at Annex II and Annex III respectively. We do not have a breakdown of the number of intake and departure of academic supporting staff, administrative, technical, and other staff and technical research staff, as well as a breakdown of the background of the staff or the reasons for departure, such as retirement, completion of contract, transfer to other local universities, etc.

In the light of the changes in the global higher education landscape, the Education Bureau (EDB) has promptly called on all universities in Hong Kong to introduce facilitation measures for affected students and scholars with a view to safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests, while attracting top talent in accordance with their diversified admissions and talent policies. The EDB is pleased to see that local universities are responding proactively and closely monitoring the situation, fully utilising the Government's facilitation initiatives that support the capacity expansion and quality enhancement of post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong.

We will continue to keep a close eye on the development and accordingly consider support measures for them in a holistic approach so as to give full play to Hong Kong's role as an international post-secondary education hub. Apart from the recruitment measures of the institutions, the Government attracts more top talent to pursue their studies in Hong Kong through a range of initiatives, including doubling the cap on non-local students in publicly funded post-secondary institutions to 40 per cent, increasing scholarship quotas, and gradually increasing the number of places under the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme. We remain committed to pursuing various policies and initiatives, fostering networks and partnerships at the national, regional, and; international levels, and will continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders to promote the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand. These efforts align with the national strategies to invigorate the country through science and education, cultivate high-calibre talent, and advance innovation and development, thereby contributing to meeting the needs of our nation."

問題：

關於大學教育資助委員會資助大學教職員，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，過去三個學年，每年八所大學教育資助委員會資助大學（八大）的新入職教職員人數（包括但不限於（i）高級教學人員、（ii）初級教學人員、（iii）教學輔助人員、（iv）行政、技術及其他人員，以及（v）研究技術人員），以及其佔所屬職級教職員的百分比分別為何，並按（A）大學、（B）學科／部門（包括但不限於（I）醫科、牙科和護理科、（II）理學科，以及（III）教育及持續教育科），以及（C）相關教職員的背景（即（a）持有香港永久性居民身份證，以及（b）獲入境事務處根據高端人才通行證計劃、一般就業政策和非本地畢業生留港／回港就業安排等計劃批出簽證的人士）列出分項數字；

答覆︰

主席：

就周文港議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

香港整體教育競爭力在全球排名前五，專上教育高度國際化和多元化，至今五所大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助大學打入全球百強，六所資助大學位列亞洲五十強，多所大學在全球最國際化大學排名中名列前茅，並擁有優秀的研究人才，對全球學生學者深具吸引力。各所大學均按其院校發展策略，以及教學和研究的需要進行全球招聘，不斷增強自身的環球競爭優勢。由政務司司長督導的教育、科技和人才委員會的帶領下，政府會繼續推動國際高端人才集聚香港，統籌推進教育、科技和人才一體化融合發展，擴大銜接連貫，制訂政策推動育才、匯才、科技協同發展，以鞏固香港作為國際專上教育樞紐及國際創新科技中心的地位。

過去多年，隨着政府增加對高等教育的資源投放及推出多項支持措施，教資會資助大學的教務部門職員人數由二○二一／二二學年的13 548人增加4.5%至二○二三／二四學年的14 161人，當中高級及初級教學人員數目增加8.5%由4 974人增至5 398人。離職人數亦由399人下跌至378人。整體來説，香港高等院校正積極推展「擴容提質」的目標，在招攬和挽留人才均取得一定成效。

各大學教務部門職員按職級、大學及部門成本中心組別劃分的實際人員數目見附件一，而高級／初級教學人員的入職及離職人數分別見附件二及附件三。我們並無備存教學輔助人員、行政、技術及其他人員和硏究技術人員的入職及離職人數，以及教職員背景或離職原因（如退休、完成合約、轉至其他本地大學任職等）的分項數字。

因應目前全球教育格局變化，教育局已即時呼籲全港所有大學，為受影響的學生學者提供便利措施，維護他們的正當合法權益，並按各院校多元招生及人才政策，吸引頂尖人才。教育局樂見本港各大學均積極回應及密切留意情況，充分善用政府支持本地專上院校擴容提質的便利措施。

我們會繼續密切留意事態發展，並因應他們的需要通盤考慮支援方案，發揮香港作為國際專上教育樞紐的角色。除院校的招聘措施外，政府亦通過一系列措施，包括提升政府資助的專上院校非本地學生限額一倍至40%、增加獎學金名額、並逐步增加香港博士研究生獎學金計劃名額，吸引更多傑出人才來港就學。我們會繼續推展各項政策措施，並在國家、地區和國際層面推動聯繫網絡和夥伴關係，亦會繼續與各持份者合作，加強推廣及宣傳「留學香港」品牌，致力配合國家科教興國、優質人才、創新發展的戰略，為國家的需要貢獻我們的力量。"
《2025年飛機乘客離境稅條例（修訂附表2）令》周五刊憲,2025-06-11 15:30,2025-06-11 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100326.htm,"《2025年飛機乘客離境稅條例（修訂附表2）令》（修訂令）將於本周五（六月十三日）刊憲，以擴大《飛機乘客離境稅條例》（第140章）（條例）下獲豁免繳付飛機乘客離境稅的乘客範圍。

條例現時容許若干類別的乘客豁免繳付離境稅，包括12歲以下兒童、直接或轉機過境、在同一日內乘搭飛機抵港及離港、乘搭車輛經港珠澳大橋或乘搭船舶抵達香港國際機場（機場），並在其後乘搭飛機離開香港前一直停留在限制區內的人士等。

二零二五至二六年度《財政預算案》公布離境稅由每名乘客120元調升至200元。雖然增幅只佔市民和旅客的整體出行開支很小部分，對飛機乘客影響輕微，但為了提高香港國際機場競爭力，政府考慮持份者意見後，條例下的豁免範圍將擴大至涵蓋：

（一）乘搭飛機抵達機場，然後於抵達當日或下一日於機場乘搭飛機離境的乘客（即最多四十八小時）﹔及

（二）以乘搭飛機以外的方式經過出入境檢查抵達香港，然後於抵達當日或下一日於機場乘搭飛機離境的乘客（即最多四十八小時）。條例將加入豁除條文，以防止個別人士刻意在短時間內往返香港和內地或澳門以符合豁免離境稅資格。

兩項新增豁免將於今年十月一日與離境稅新稅率一併生效，於當日或之後抵港並符合豁免條件的乘客將獲豁免離境稅。根據二○二四年航空客運統計數字，兩項豁免每年可惠及約83萬名航空轉機乘客和約250萬名多式聯運轉機乘客，政府每年收入可能減少約6億7千萬元。

政府發言人說︰「新增豁免有助吸引更多乘客使用機場，從而鞏固香港作為國際航空樞紐的地位。由於會有更多轉機旅客在逗留期間在酒店住宿和本地消費，豁免將帶來正面經濟效益。」

政府將委託香港機場管理局（機管局）一站式處理所有合資格乘客的退款申請。機管局將設立新電子申請平台，供乘客申請在機場收取現金退款或以其他方式（例如信用卡和電子支付平台）退款。

修訂令將於六月十八日提交立法會省覽，進行先訂立後審議程序。"
Air Passenger Departure Tax Ordinance (Amendment of Second Schedule) Order 2025 to be gazetted this Friday,2025-06-11 15:30,2025-06-11 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100324.htm,"  The Air Passenger Departure Tax Ordinance (Amendment of Second Schedule) Order 2025 will be gazetted this Friday (June 13) to expand the scope of passengers to be exempted from paying the air passenger departure tax (APDT) under the Air Passenger Departure Tax Ordinance (Cap. 140) (the Ordinance).

  The Ordinance currently allows certain classes of passengers to be exempted from payment of the APDT, including children under 12 years of age, direct transit or connecting flight passengers, passengers who arrive at and depart from Hong Kong by aircraft on the same day, and passengers who arrive at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) by vehicle via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge or by ship and subsequently depart from Hong Kong by aircraft while remaining within the restricted area at all times before departure, etc.

  The 2025-26 Budget announced the increase of APDT from $120 to $200 per passenger. While the increase will only have a minimal impact on air passengers as it constitutes only a very small portion of the overall travelling cost of the general public and tourists, with a view to enhancing the competitiveness of HKIA, the Government, having considered the stakeholders' view, will expand the exemption scope under the Ordinance to include:

(1) passengers arriving at HKIA by aircraft and departing from HKIA by aircraft on the arrival day or on the following day (i.e. a maximum of 48 hours); and

(2) passengers arriving in Hong Kong through immigration controls by means other than by aircraft and departing from HKIA by aircraft on the arrival day or on the following day (i.e. a maximum of 48 hours), with an exclusionary provision incorporated to prevent people from making a brief return trip between Hong Kong and the Mainland or Macao deliberately so that they can be eligible for an exemption of the APDT.

  The two new exemptions will take effect on October 1 this year, together with the new tax rate of the APDT. Passengers arriving in Hong Kong on or after that day and meeting the exemption criteria will be exempted from the APDT. Based on air passenger traffic statistics in 2024, the two exemptions could benefit about 830 000 air transfer passengers and about 2.5 million intermodal transfer passengers annually, leading to a potential revenue foregone of about $670 million per year.

  A Government spokesman said, ""The new exemptions can help attract more passengers to use HKIA, thus consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub. As there will be more transfer passengers' spending on hotel accommodation and local consumption during their stay, the exemptions are expected to bring about positive economic benefits.""

  The Government will engage the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA) to handle refund applications centrally for all eligible passengers. The AA will set up a new e-application platform for passengers to apply for receiving the refund by cash at the airport or by other means, such as credit cards and electronic payment platforms.

"Applications for new niches at Wo Hop Shek, Cape Collinson-San Ha and Shek Mun Columbariums to close on June 18",2025-06-11 15:15,2025-06-11 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/11/P2025061100575.htm,"  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (June 11) reminded members of the public who wish to apply for allocations of new extendable niches at Wo Hop Shek Columbarium Phase VI in Fanling, Cape Collinson-San Ha Columbarium in Eastern District or Shek Mun Columbarium in Sha Tin for the deceased to promptly submit their applications on or before the deadline of June 18 (Wednesday).

  An FEHD spokesman said, ""For this niche allocation exercise, Wo Hop Shek Columbarium Phase VI provides 4 000 standard niches and 50 large niches; Cape Collinson-San Ha Columbarium provides 6 000 standard niches and 50 large niches, while Shek Mun Columbarium provides 6 000 standard smoke-free niches and 50 large smoke-free niches.""

  Taking into account the views of residents in the vicinity, Shek Mun Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance will be a smoke-free columbarium project, i.e. the columbarium will not provide any facilities for burning joss sticks and offerings. Burning of joss sticks and incense offerings will be banned completely within the columbarium area, including all floors and common areas.

  Members of the public can apply online or download the application form from the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk) or the Platform for Cemeteries and Crematoria Services (app.fehd.gov.hk/ccsp). They can also obtain the application form in person from the Hong Kong or Kowloon Cemeteries and Crematoria Office, District Environmental Hygiene Offices of the FEHD, or Home Affairs Enquiry Centres of the Home Affairs Department, or by fax via hotline 2841 9111.

  The spokesman advises applicants to give priority to an online submission to avoid postal delays or non-delivery. Upon submission, applicants will promptly receive an acknowledgement receipt with a case number, thus facilitating the follow-up of the application in the future. If the applicant is the same person who has applied for the cremation service for the deceased, it is more convenient to submit the application online by exempting the need to attach copies of the required documents and having the application online granted automatically. If not submitting their application online, applicants shall submit the completed application form together with copies of the required documents by the above-mentioned fax or email, by post or in person to the Hong Kong or Kowloon Cemeteries and Crematoria Office within the application period.

  To avoid missing the application deadline, the spokesman reminded those intending to apply for allocation of the above niches for the deceased to submit the completed application forms together with the copies of required documents on or before June 18.
