DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-04 06:46,2025-09-04 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090300834.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 4) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

海關人員四月十日在沙頭角中英街檢查站截查一名以單車運送一批貨物的四十八歲本地男子。經檢查後，海關人員在貨物中的八個紙箱內及在該男子身上的肩背包中檢獲共三萬七千二百三十七支未完稅香煙，他隨即被捕。該批未完稅香煙市值約十八萬六千元，應課稅值約十二萬三千元。他今日被判處監禁四個月。

另外，海關人員昨日（九月二日）在羅湖管制站截查一名六十二歲抵港男旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲共二千二百二十七支未完稅香煙，估計市值約九千一百元，應課稅值約七千四百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日被判處監禁六星期。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，反映不論是否屬於初犯，亦可能被判處監禁。監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民切勿以身試法。根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

Two men convicted and jailed for importing and possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-09-03 19:30,2025-09-03 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/03/P2025090300694.htm,"  A local man and an incoming male passenger were sentenced to four months' imprisonment and six weeks' imprisonment respectively by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (September 3) for importing and possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes, as well as for failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) and the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

  Customs officers intercepted a 48-year-old local man, who was carrying a batch of goods on a bike, for inspection at the Chung Ying Street Checkpoint in Sha Tau Kok on April 10. Upon inspection, a total of 37 237 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from eight carton boxes of the consignment and a shoulder bag carried by the man. The man was subsequently arrested. The estimated market value of the duty-not-paid cigarettes was about $186,000 and the duty potential was about $123,000. He was sentenced to four months' imprisonment today.

  In addition, Customs officers intercepted an incoming 62-year-old male passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (September 2) and seized 2 227 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $9,100 and a duty potential of about $7,400 from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment today.

  Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds members of the public not to defy the law. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

  Under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years. 

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-03 18:20,2025-09-03 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/03/P2025090300604.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 3), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 225 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 24 to 30), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 830 cases (August 10 to 16) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad. The CHP also urged schools to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. They should also remind staff members and students to enact mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html).

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that they must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月二十四日至三十日）廣東省新增225宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別為830宗（八月十日至十六日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的新增病例數字過去一個月持續遞減，但現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。中心亦呼籲學校按照食物環境衞生署（食環署）的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，務必提醒教職員及學生，應時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。」

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食環署繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成10種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；

The Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence (MWRCD) organised activities, including a sharing session on the War of Resistance and film screenings, to commemorate the 80th Anniversary of the Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, aiming to deepen the knowledge of the public and students about the War of Resistance.

The museum invited the Deputy President of the Society of Veterans of the Original Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column, Mr Lam Ming, to host a sharing session with local secondary students. He shared the wartime stories of his father's generation. Mr Lam's father joined the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column at the age of 16, and together with Mr Lam's grand uncle, a maritime communication line was established from the Shek Shui Kan Radio Station at Wu Kau Tang to the Battalion Headquarters in Chek Keng, Sai Kung. Mr Lam hopes that the public will commemorate the sacrifices and contributions of the martyrs of the War of Resistance. Secondary students who participated in the sharing session said that they will remember the history of the War of Resistance and cherish the hard-earned peace.

There was also a collaborative art creation activity, inviting members of the public to write greeting cards to express their feelings about the War of Resistance as well as respect for the martyrs and veterans.

In collaboration with the Hong Kong Film Archive, the MWRCD also arranged two screenings of the anti-war movie ""Life Goes On"" (2024) today, which received overwhelming feedback. The film recounts the story of a group of university teachers and students in southern China who endured great hardships during the war, relocating to northern Guangdong and persevering in their educational pursuits despite adverse circumstances.

The ""Standing Together for Peacebuilding: Commemorating the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance in Guangdong and Hong Kong"" exhibition, jointly organised by the MWRCD and the Guangdong Museum of Revolutionary History, is currently on display. Featuring some 40 items/sets of wartime relics and around 150 historical photos, the exhibition shows the history of the people of Guangdong and Hong Kong, led by the Chinese Communist Party, and how they were closely united in resisting the enemy. The exhibition will run until July 8 next year, with free admission. The museum also launches a series of free programmes, including lectures, workshops, film screenings, field visits, and travelling exhibitions.

"Commemorating martyrs in resistance against Japanese aggression through archives: ""Unyielding Land, Eternal Heroes"" exhibition revisits Hong Kong's three years and eight months of Japanese occupation (with photos)",2025-09-03 17:15,2025-09-03 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/03/P2025090300271.htm,"  âToday (September 3) marks the Victory Day of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. On this 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance, the Public Records Office (PRO) of the Government Records Service (GRS) has specially curated its annual thematic exhibition, this one entitled ""Unyielding Land, Eternal Heroes: 80th Anniversary of Victory in the War of Resistance"", featuring precious archives and documented heritage for members of the public to revisit Hong Kong's painful period during the Japanese occupation (1941-1945) and understand the heroic resistance of the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column against the enemy.

  On December 25, 1941, Hong Kong entered three years and eight months of Japanese occupation, during which residents suffered from the invasion, severe food shortages and various hardships. During the early stages of the Japanese occupation, the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column broke through enemy defence lines, successfully rescuing groups of prominent figures in various sectors. Throughout the Japanese occupation, they braved life-and-death danger to engage in combat with the Japanese army, penetrating deep into enemy territories and waters to restrain and attack enemy forces.

  This exhibition showcases over 120 selected items, including photographs documenting the daily marches of the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column and paintings depicting their heroic victories against the enemy, a name list of the Hong Kong Independent Battalion of the Dongjiang Column who died in the defence of Hong Kong, the ""Register of Enemy Properties"" documenting property confiscated by the Japanese Military Government, etc. Additionally, the items reveal stories including the then Hong Kong Government pursuing after the war the recovery of books from the libraries of the University of Hong Kong looted by the Japanese forces, the demolition of the Japanese War Memorial, etc. The precious documented heritage bears witness to the harsh lives of Hong Kong residents during the Japanese occupation and the fearless spirit of the anti-Japanese heroes.

  The thematic exhibition is open from today onwards from Monday to Friday, 9am to 5.45pm (except public holidays), at the Exhibition Hall on the second floor of the Hong Kong Public Records Building at 13 Tsui Ping Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon. Admission is free. In addition to distinctive photo spots, visitors can also experience the weight of the daily rice ration of ""6.4 taels"" during the Japanese occupation, understanding the hardships of people's lives at that time.

To provide members of the public with a better understanding of this history, the PRO has developed a thematic online exhibition (www.grs.gov.hk/ws/online/80VWR/en/home/index.html). Its Facebook page (www.facebook.com/grs.publicrecordsoffice) will regularly share selected exhibition content and historical stories.

The PRO will also organise roving exhibitions of this thematic exhibition in various districts of Hong Kong. Details will be announced on the GRS website (www.grs.gov.hk) and the PRO Facebook page later. For enquiries, please contact the PRO at 2195 7700 or email to proinfo@grs.gov.hk."

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-09-03 11:26,2025-09-03 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/03/P2025090300303.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."
