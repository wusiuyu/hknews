答覆：

主席：

會議及展覽（會展）業是香港作為國際貿易中心的重要一環，香港特別行政區（特區）政府一直透過不同措施，推動會展業的長遠發展。

特區政府於二○二三年七月首次推出「定期展覽獎勵計劃」（計劃），提供場租獎勵，吸引不同規模的本地和國際展覽持續在港舉行，每場展覽的獎勵上限為2,000萬元。計劃已於二○二五年六月三十日結束，反應非常理想，共支援約220場合資格展覽，涉及的總金額超過12億元。我們就計劃發布的申請指引清楚訂明合資格展覽的要求，所有申請均符合申請資格。計劃所支援的展覽吸引了眾多參加者（包括參展商和買家），不單令會展業界受惠，展覽帶來高消費商務旅客，帶動住宿、餐飲、零售、娛樂等其他行業的經濟活動，令多個行業受益。

為進一步推動會展業和盛事經濟的發展，從而為香港創造整體經濟效益，特區政府於二○二四年《施政報告》宣布再撥款五億元於今年七月一日推出「定期展覽獎勵計劃2.0」（計劃2.0），聚焦支持新設及定期的大型國際性展覽在場租方面的支出，為香港會展業注入新活力。經總結業界的意見和原計劃的運作經驗後，新計劃加入一些新安排，包括：

（一）只涵蓋非本地參加者（包括參展商和買家）數目達1 500人的國際展覽；
（二）每個合資格展覽可獲的場租獎勵金額上限為1,000萬元；及
（三）除香港會議展覽中心（會展中心）和亞洲國際博覽館（亞博館）外，新增中環海濱活動空間和西九文化區的相關部分為指定場地。

上述安排旨在聚焦國際性活動，惠及更多合資格展覽，以及為主辦單位提供更多場地選擇。

根據申請指引，主辦單位可於合資格展覽完成後的兩個月內提交申請。由於計劃2.0仍在起步階段，我們暫時只收到和處理了大約10個申請，涉及的總金額約為4,000萬元。如申請指引所述及我們過去向業界於不同場合解釋，計劃2.0會於款項用畢後結束，我們會視乎款項的實際運用情況，適時公布計劃2.0的結束日期。就此，我們會與有關場地營辦商和業界保持緊密溝通。

此外，特區政府透過「中小企業市場推廣基金」（「市場推廣基金」）提供資助，鼓勵香港中小企業參與出口推廣活動，拓展境外市場。為支援企業於疫情期間和疫後復蘇時期進行更多推廣，「市場推廣基金」自二○二一年四月底推行特別措施，擴大資助範圍，涵蓋以本地市場為目標的展覽會和網上展覽會，同時放寬只限中小企業申請的要求。有關特別措施已延長至二○二六年六月底。

由二○二一年五月至二○二五年九月底，「市場推廣基金」共接獲約42 150宗涉及本地市場為目標的展覽會及網上展覽會的申請，當中共約30 700宗已完成處理並批出資助。「市場推廣基金」的資助對象為推廣其產品／服務的企業，因此工業貿易署只就申請企業及其參展內容收集資料，而未有備存問題所述的其他展覽會數據。

特區政府於二○二五年三月宣布在「市場推廣基金」及「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）下推出措施，以更聚焦和可持續方式為中小企業提供支援。目前，「市場推廣基金」的資助比例已由核准開支總費用的1（政府）：1（企業）調整至1：3。每宗申請10萬元的資助上限則維持不變。

由於現時的營商環境充滿不明朗因素及挑戰，企業更須升級轉型，以及在傳統市場以外作多元化發展以維持競爭力。傳統的商業模式（如單純刊登產品資料或純宣傳推廣）或已有所不足。為聚焦有限資源以裝備企業升級轉型，「市場推廣基金」將於二○二六年六月三十日後，整合至「BUD專項基金」。由二○二六年七月一日起，申請企業可在升級轉型的前提下，就出口推廣和宣傳活動申請「BUD專項基金」。為協助企業適應整合安排，二○二五年《施政報告》亦宣布我們會加強宣傳和協助企業透過「BUD專項基金」——「申請易」參與展覽會和出口推廣活動，以拓展更多元化的市場。

現時，大部分企業尚未用罄「BUD專項基金」下的700萬元的累計資助上限，故我們相信整合後企業仍可靈活運用「BUD專項基金」，推行市場推廣活動。

為長遠鞏固香港作為國際會展業樞紐的地位，除了上述的獎勵及資助計劃，特區政府會繼續擴建會展設施。香港機場管理局已開展亞博館的擴建工程，項目預計在二○二八年落成。同時，特區政府繼續按計劃推進會展中心附近的灣仔北重建項目，包括將灣仔北三座政府大樓、告士打道花園及港灣消防局用地重建為會展設施、酒店等。亞博館第二期擴建計劃和灣仔北重建項目預計合共提供額外63 750平方米的可租用會展面積。特區政府在推展這兩項計劃的同時，會致力靈活運用現有場地和設施，以滿足市場需求。"
LCQ22: Support for exhibition industry,2025-10-15 16:42,2025-10-15 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500591.htm," âFollowing is a question by the Hon Yung Hoi-yan and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 âTo support the exhibition industry in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government provides funding to organisers and exhibitors through schemes such as the Incentive Scheme for Recurrent Exhibitions (ISRE), the ISRE 2.0 and the SME Export Marketing Fund (EMF). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information (i) since the launch of the ISRE, and (ii) since the introduction of special measures under the EMF on April 30, 2021: the respective numbers of applications received and approved, together with the names of the organisers of the subsidised eligible exhibitions, their exhibition content, dates, venues, amounts of funding received, numbers and proportions of local and overseas exhibitors, numbers and proportions of local and overseas visitors and the regions of origin of overseas exhibitors and visitors (set out in a table);

(2) as some members of the industry have relayed that the ISRE 2.0 launched by the Government on July 1 this year does not have a specified end date, which affects the industry's cost budgeting for organising exhibitions, when the Government will announce the end date of the ISRE 2.0, and whether it will optimise the ISRE 2.0 by, for example, adjusting the quota for non-local participants and relaxing requirements such as the gross floor area used for demonstrating or displaying products, materials and services; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that the EMF will be consolidated into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales after June 30, 2026, with adjustments to the funding ceiling, matching ratio, etc, whether the Government has assessed the impact of these adjustments on the industry (e.g. the number of applications and the scale of activities); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) apart from the aforementioned funding schemes, whether the Government has other policy measures to support the exhibition industry, with a view to maintaining its competitiveness and encouraging further investment; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 âThe convention and exhibition (C&E) industry is crucial to Hong Kong as an international trade centre. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been promoting the long-term development of the C&E industry through various measures.

 âThe HKSAR Government first launched the Incentive Scheme for Recurrent Exhibitions (ISRE) in July 2023, providing venue rental incentives to attract local and international exhibitions of different scales to be staged recurrently in Hong Kong. The maximum incentive for each exhibition was capped at $20 million. The ISRE ended on June 30, 2025, and was very well received, supporting around 220 eligible exhibitions with the total incentive amount exceeding $1.2 billion. The requirements for eligible exhibitions were clearly set out in the Application Guide promulgated by us, and all applications met the eligibility criteria. The exhibitions supported by the ISRE attracted numerous participants (including exhibitors and buyers), not only benefitting the C&E industry but also bringing in high-spending business travellers that drive economic activities in such related sectors as accommodation, catering, retail, entertainment, etc, thereby benefitting various industries.

 âTo further promote the development of the C&E industry and the mega event economy, thereby generating overall economic benefits for Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government announced in the 2024 Policy Address the allocation of an additional funding of $500 million for launching the ISRE 2.0 on July 1 this year. The ISRE 2.0 focuses on supporting the venue rental expenses for new and recurrent international exhibitions of a large scale with a view to boosting the vibrancy of the C&E industry in Hong Kong. Taking into account the industry's views and the operational experience of the original ISRE, a number of new features have been introduced under the new scheme, including:

(a) only international exhibitions attracting at least 1 500 non-local participants (including exhibitors and buyers) will be covered;
(b) the maximum venue rental incentive for each eligible exhibition is capped at $10 million; and
(c) the Central Harbourfront Event Space and relevant parts of the West Kowloon Cultural District are included as new specified venues, alongside the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) and AsiaWorld-Expo (AWE).

 âThe above arrangements aim to focus on international events, benefit more eligible exhibitions and offer more venue options to the organisers.

 âAccording to the Application Guide, organisers may submit applications within two months after completion of the eligible exhibitions. As the ISRE 2.0 is still in the inception stage, we have received and processed about 10 applications so far, involving a total incentive amount of around $40 million. As stipulated in the Application Guide and explained to the industry on various occasions earlier on, the ISRE 2.0 will end upon exhaustion of the funds. Subject to the actual utilisation of the funds, we will announce the end date of the ISRE 2.0 in good time. We will maintain close liaison with the relevant venue operators and the industry in this regard.

 âIn addition, the HKSAR Government provides funding support through the SME Export Marketing Fund (EMF) to encourage Hong Kong small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to participate in export marketing activities and tap into non-local markets. To support enterprises to conduct more promotion during the pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery periods, special measures have been implemented under the EMF since end-April 2021 to expand the funding scope to cover exhibitions targeting the local market and online exhibitions, as well as relaxing the eligibility criteria to cover non-SMEs. Relevant special measures have been extended to end-June 2026.

 âFrom May 2021 to end-September 2025, around 42 150 applications involving exhibitions targeting the local market and online exhibitions have been received under the EMF, among which around 30 700 applications have been processed and approved. As the EMF targets at enterprises promoting their products/services, the Trade and Industry Department only collects information about applicant enterprises and their participation in exhibitions, but does not maintain other exhibition-related statistics mentioned in the question.

 âIn March 2025, the HKSAR Government announced the implementation of various measures under the EMF and the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) with a view to providing support to SMEs in a more focused and sustainable manner. Currently, the matching ratio of the EMF has been adjusted from 1 (Government): 1 (enterprise) to 1:3 of the total approved expenditure. There is no change to the funding ceiling per application of $100,000.

 âAs the current business environment is rife with uncertainties and challenges, it is imperative for enterprises to upgrade and diversify away from traditional markets to remain competitive. Traditional modes of business (such as mere product listing or publicity) may not suffice. To focus our limited resources to equip enterprises for upgrading and transformation, the EMF will be consolidated into the BUD Fund after June 30, 2026. Starting from July 1, 2026, enterprises may, in the context of upgrading and transformation, apply for the BUD Fund to participate in exporting marketing and promotional activities. To assist enterprises in adapting to the arrangements of the consolidation, it has been announced in the 2025 Policy Address that we will enhance promotion and facilitate the participation of companies in exhibitions and export promotion activities through ""Easy BUD"" under the BUD Fund, thereby developing more diversified markets.

 âCurrently, most enterprises have not yet fully utilised the $7 million cumulative funding ceiling under the BUD Fund. We believe that enterprises can still flexibly utilise the BUD Fund after the consolidation to implement marketing activities.

 âTo consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international C&E hub in the long run, apart from the abovementioned incentive and subsidy schemes, the HKSAR Government will continue to take forward the expansion projects of C&E facilities. The Airport Authority Hong Kong has commenced the construction works for the AWE expansion, which is expected to be completed in 2028. Meanwhile, the HKSAR Government continues to take forward the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project near the HKCEC as planned, including the redevelopment of the sites of the Wan Chai Government Offices Compound, Gloucester Road Garden and Kong Wan Fire Station into C&E facilities, hotel, etc. The AWE Phase 2 expansion project and the Wan Chai North Redevelopment project are expected to provide an additional 63 750 square metres of rentable C&E space. While implementing these two projects, the HKSAR Government will strive to flexibly utilise the existing venues and facilities for meeting the market demand."
立法會三題：政府部門推出的流動應用程式,2025-10-15 16:30,2025-10-15 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500407.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上李鎮強議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，政府推出的流動應用程式功能分散，市民往往需要下載多個應用程式，以獲取不同的政府資訊和服務，變相浪費時間及公帑。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年下載量最少的10個政府流動應用程式及其下載次數為何；該等應用程式的下載量是否達到推出時所訂立的目標；

（二）過去五年，每年提供最多流動應用程式供市民下載的10個政府部門為何，並列出該等部門應用程式的主要功能及每年的維護成本；及

（三）鑑於政府表示，目標在今年年底前將所有政府流動應用程式所提供的服務，遷移至「智方便」的小程序平台上，以達至「一網通辦」，並在未來兩年內將政府的應用程式數量減半，有關工作的具體詳情及進展為何，包括會否將運輸署最新推出的「電子駕駛執照」流動應用程式整合至「智方便」內，以減省維護成本？

答覆：

主席：

就李鎮強議員提問的三個部分，經諮詢相關決策局及部門（局／部門）後，我現綜合回覆如下：

流動應用程式是政府推行電子政務的其中一種途徑，而「便民利民」一直是我們的指導原則。各局／部門會按其業務需要開發不同流動應用程式，供市民下載和使用。現時，34個局／部門正在營運75個流動應用程式，涉及不同的政策範疇。就問題（一）及（二）有關政府流動應用程式下載量最少及提供最多流動應用程式的部門等資料，現分別載於附件一及附件二。

數字政策辦公室（數字辦）已就開發及推行政府流動應用程式發布《流動應用程式實務指南》（《指南》），當中要求各局／部門在開發前須確立流動應用程式的目的和用途，並在推出後定期檢討，以具成本效益的方式更新、優化或整合現有的流動應用程式。在衡量成效時，除了下載量之外，各局／部門亦會綜合考慮流動應用程式的目標用戶群組（例如是否專為有特殊需要人士而設）、用戶意見、需求變化等因素。過去五年，局／部門已將約40個流動應用程式下架或整合至其他平台。

與此同時，為了加強統籌有關局／部門推出數字政府服務的工作，數字辦於今年年初發出通告，要求各局／部門須以「智方便」作為其新的流動應用程式或網上服務的優先服務提供平台，除非理據充分並獲得局／部門首長及數字辦的批准，局／部門不可開發全新和獨立於「智方便」平台的流動應用程式。

事實上，數字政府的其中一個政策目標，就是透過「智方便」中央平台讓市民大眾一站式獲取政府資訊和服務，以及辦理電子政務時可「一網通辦」。數字辦於今年在「智方便」推出「小程序平台」界面，是達至數字政府一體化的重要一步，市民屆時毋須下載不同局／部門推出的流動應用程式，便可透過「智方便」小程序直接登入並使用局／部門的電子服務。如局／部門因應其政策、用戶體驗及運作考慮需要繼續保留或推行個別流動應用程式（尤其是一些具備眾多或複雜功能的程式），局／部門亦可利用「智方便」把部分用戶常用流動應用程式功能轉移至「小程序平台」，大大提升市民使用電子政府服務的便捷度。

「智方便」的「小程序平台」將於今年十二月推出。我們預計目前政府流動應用程式中約20多個可於兩年內逐步轉移至「小程序平台」運行，另外有約20個程式會陸續下架，從而大大減少政府流動應用程式的數量。至於餘下約30個應用程式（包括運輸署的「電子駕駛執照」），數字辦會與相關局／部門持續檢視推行情況，以確保政府流動應用程式達致其「便民利民」的初心。"
LCQ3: Mobile applications launched by government departments,2025-10-15 16:30,2025-10-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500409.htm,"  âFollowing is a question by the Hon Lee Chun-keung and a reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Industry and Industry Bureau, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  There are views that the functions of mobile applications launched by the Government are fragmented, and that members of the public often need to download multiple applications to access various government information and services, which in effect results in a waste of time and public money. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the 10 government mobile applications with the lowest number of downloads in each of the past five years and their respective download figures; whether the numbers of downloads of these applications have met the targets set at the time of their launch;

(2) of the 10 government departments that have provided the largest number of mobile applications for public download in each of the past five years, and set out the key functions of these applications and their respective annual maintenance costs; and


(3) as the Government has indicated that it aims to migrate all services provided by various government mobile applications into the ""iAM Smart"" mini-program platform by the end of this year to achieve a ""single portal for e-government services"", and reduce the number of government applications by half within the coming two years, of the specific details and progress of such exercises, including whether it will integrate the newly launched ""Electronic Driving Licence"" mobile application from the Transport Department into ""iAM Smart"" to reduce maintenance costs?

Replyï¼

President,

  In respect of the question raised by the Hon Lee Chun-keung, having consolidated the information provided by relevant bureaux/departments (B/Ds), my reply is as follows:

  Mobile applications (apps) are one of the approaches for the Government to implement e-Government services, with ""bringing convenience and benefits to the public"" being our guiding principle. B/Ds develop various mobile apps according to their business need for the public to download and use. Currently, there are 75 mobile apps being maintained by 34 B/Ds, covering different policy areas. Regarding questions (1) and (2) on the Government mobile apps with the lowest numbers of download and the B/Ds providing the highest numbers of mobile apps, the relevant information is set out at Annex 1 and Annex 2 respectively.

  The Digital Policy Office (DPO) has published the ""Practice Guide for Developing Mobile Apps"" for the development and implementation of government mobile apps. It is stipulated that B/Ds are required to set out the objectives and usage of the app before development and to conduct regular review after the apps are launched to ensure that the apps are updated, optimised, or integrated with existing apps in a cost-effective manner. In evaluating the effectiveness, apart from the numbers of download, B/Ds also comprehensively consider factors including the target user groups (e.g. whether the apps are designed specifically for people with special needs), user feedback and the changing demands. Over the past five years, B/Ds have decommissioned or consolidated around 40 mobile apps into other platforms.

  At the same time, to strengthen the co-ordination of digital government services launched by various B/Ds, the DPO issued a circular early this year requiring B/Ds to prioritise the use of ""iAM Smart"" as the primary platform for delivering their new mobile apps or online services. B/Ds shall not develop new standalone mobile apps which are separated from the ""iAM Smart"" platform unless there are sufficient justifications and approvals from the Heads of B/Ds and the DPO.

  In fact, one of the policy goals of the digital government is to facilitate the public to access government information and services in a one-stop manner, enabling handling of e-Government services on a single portal through the centralised ""iAM Smart"" platform. The DPO is introducing a ""Mini-program Platform"" in ""iAM Smart"" this year, marking an important step toward an integrated digital government. Citizens will be able to directly access and use e-services provided by various B/Ds with the mini-programs in ""iAM Smart"", without the need to download the mobile apps provided by individual B/Ds. If B/Ds need to retain or launch individual mobile apps due to policy, user experience or operational considerations (particularly for apps with numerous or complex functions), they can also leverage ""iAM Smart"" by migrating some frequently used functions to the ""Mini-program Platform"" to significantly enhance the convenience of accessing e-Government services for the public.

  The ""Mini-program Platform"" of ""iAM Smart"" will be launched in December this year. We anticipate that about 20 or more of the existing government mobile apps can be gradually migrated to the ""Mini-program Platform"" within two years, while around 20 mobile apps will be phased out, substantially reducing the total number of government mobile apps. As for the remaining roughly 30 apps (including the Transport Department’s ""Electronic Driving Licence""), the DPO will continue to work with the relevant B/Ds to review their implementation, ensuring that government mobile apps fulfill their original purpose of ""bringing convenience and benefits to the public""."

答覆：

主席：

北部都會區（北都）是香港的戰略發展區域，也是我們為未來包括下一代作出的重大投資和建設。北都面積和未來人口約佔香港的三分之一，可提供3 000多公頃新發展土地，當中的產業用地推動創新科技（創科）以至其他產業發展，創造超過50萬個優質多元工作職位。北都也是未來公、私營房屋供應的重要來源，將提供約50萬個新住宅單位。北都的規劃亦能推動更佳的職住平衡，拉近工作地點與居所的距離，並提供完善居住和工作配套，改善生活質素。

就陳曼琪議員的提問，經諮詢相關政策局後，現回覆如下（因提問的第一至三部分有關連，我們為該部分作出綜合回覆）：

（一）至（三）在北都新發展區規劃上，為照顧青年人在不同人生階段的需要（例如就學、就業、住屋等），發展局連同相關部門一直以多元發展的方針進行土地規劃。

在就學方面，在進行北都新發展區的規劃時，我們會根據《香港規劃標準與準則》的規定及相關政府部門的要求，預留足夠土地發展中、小學，並會按各部門評估的需求，為幼稚園及其他政府、機構及社區設施預留土地或樓面空間。為支持香港發展成為國際專上教育樞紐，政府已預留用地發展北都大學城，一方面滿足青少年對專上教育的需求，另一方面助力香港打造「留學香港」品牌。此外，北都也預留大量用地作文化和體育發展之用，讓不同志趣的青少年都有廣闊空間盡展所長。

在就業和創業方面，北都採用「產業帶動」的發展模式，為不同產業帶來龐大的發展空間，創造大量優質且多元化的職位，配合青年的就業需求之餘，也締造有利的創業環境。以創科產業為例，北都的新田科技城，包括河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區），將提供300公頃的創科用地，容納約700萬平方米的總樓面面積，相當於17個香港科學園，大大提升本港創科產業和初創企業的發展空間。此外，流浮山將定位為數碼科技樞紐，將利用先進科技，推動新經濟與傳統經濟融合，並成為孕育青年人才和初創企業的搖籃。北都內的新發展區正處於不同的規劃及建設階段，按規劃階段的假設估計將創造超過50萬個新工作職位，有關職位的規劃分布估計載於附件。而就這些新工作職位，各政策局及部門會因應各行業的最新發展及人力需求情況，提供相應的本地人才培訓計劃。

在住屋方面，北都將會是香港未來房屋供應的主要來源，預計可提供約50萬個新住宅單位，照顧社會不同階層家庭（包括青年家庭）的住屋需求。新發展區也提供契機回應公眾對更寬敞居住空間的訴求，根據《香港2030+：跨越2030年的規劃遠景與策略》（《香港2030+》）建議，北都較近期規劃的新發展區（包括新田科技城、牛潭尾、流浮山一帶、新界北新市鎮和馬草壟）的住宅用地規劃，均假設平均居住空間可增加百分之十至二十，為日後創造更多優質生活空間提供彈性。此外，我們亦預留彈性，可以靈活調整個別新發展區公私營房屋的比例，當中會考慮有關新發展區的產業定位，以及不同階層市民的需要。古洞北╱粉嶺北及洪水橋╱厦村新發展區的公私營房屋比例分別約為七比三以及六比四，當中的公營房屋單位包括租住公屋和出售資助房屋。其餘新發展區的公私營房屋比例則會按其定位及整體公、私營房屋的供求情況，於稍後的落實階段作靈活安排。

（四）在託兒服務方面，政府會根據以人口為基礎的規劃比率，為每25 000人口預留空間提供100個資助幼兒中心服務名額，以配合北都新發展區人口遷入所帶來的服務需求。在青少年支援方面，政府亦會為每12 000名屬於6至24歲年齡組別的兒童／青年規劃一間綜合青少年服務中心。至於青年驛站、青年宿舍等，如獲政策支持，可在北都的合適用地提供相關設施。為配合《青年發展藍圖》的政策目標，政府計劃在北都（例如在洪水橋／厦村新發展區）興建青年設施大樓及相關設施，協助青年發展，設施包括讓內地和香港青年交流、互動和協作的場地、青年活動及互動空間、青年創新和創業基地，以及青少年制服團體基地設施等。就幼稚園、小學以及中學的規劃，請見上文回覆。"
LCQ15: Measures in Northern Metropolis to support upward mobility for young people,2025-10-15 15:45,2025-10-15 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500516.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Maggie Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

The Government has indicated in the 2025 Policy Address that the Northern Metropolis (NM), which covers a land area and planned population intake accounting for about one-third of Hong Kong's total, is our city's strategic development area. There are views that the development of the NM provides opportunities for young people in Hong Kong to achieve upward mobility and build a happy life. Regarding measures in the NM to support upward mobility for young people, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the Government has planned an upward mobility ecological chain for young people, covering such areas as education, employment, home ownership and entrepreneurship, in relation to the future development of the NM; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) given the projection in the 2025 Policy Address that the NM will create about half a million new job opportunities, of the distribution and proportions of such jobs by type; whether it has formulated training programmes and strategies for nurturing local talent in close alignment with such new jobs to assist young people in seizing the relevant opportunities;

(3) in light of the population influx into the NM brought by the aforementioned half a million new job opportunities, whether it has assessed the sufficiency of residential units in the NM to meet the demand of young families; if so, of the housing plan formulated based on the assessment results, as well as the respective numerical proportions of public housing units, Home Ownership Scheme units and private residential units therein; and

(4) whether it has planned to build facilities (including youth hostels, Youth Post hostels, childcare service centres, kindergartens, and primary and secondary schools) in the NM to support the working youth and their families; if so, of the details of the plan; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Northern Metropolis (NM), a strategic development area in Hong Kong, is a major investment and construction we have made for the future, including the next generation. With an area and planned population accounting for around one-third of Hong Kong's totals, the NM will provide more than 3000 hectares of new development land. The land for different industries in the NM would drive the development of innovation and technology (I&T) and other industries, and create more than 500000 quality and diversified job opportunities. The NM is also a key source of public and private housing supply in the future, which will provide approximately 500000 new residential units. The planning of the NM will also promote better home-job balance, bringing jobs closer to homes, as well as providing supporting facilities for residents and workers which improve the quality of life.

In response to the question raised by the Hon Maggie Chan, after consulting the relevant bureaux, the reply is as follows (as Parts 1 to 3 are related, we prepared a consolidated reply for these parts):

(1) to (3) In planning the land use in new development areas (NDAs) in the NM, the Development Bureau, in collaboration with relevant departments, has been adopting a diversified development approach in order to accommodate the needs of young people at different stages of life (such as education, employment and housing).

On education, during the planning of the NDAs within the NM, we have reserved sufficient land for the development of primary and secondary schools in accordance with the requirements of the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines and relevant government departments, as well as land or floor space for kindergartens and other government, institution and community facilities to meet the demands assessed by the relevant departments. To support Hong Kong's development into an international hub for post-secondary education, the Government has reserved land for the development of the Northern Metropolis University Town. This initiative will not only meet the demand of young people for post-secondary education, but also support Hong Kong to build the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand. Furthermore, a considerable amount of land has been reserved in the NM for cultural and sports development, providing ample space for young people with diverse interests to unleash their full potentials.

On employment and entrepreneurship, the NM adopts an ""industry-driven"" development mode, offering vast development space for various industries and creating a huge number of quality and diverse jobs, thereby meeting the employment needs of young people while fostering a favourable environment for entrepreneurship. To take the I&T industry as an example, the San Tin Technopole in the NM, including the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone (Hetao Hong Kong Park), will provide 300hectares of land for I&T, capable of offering a gross floor area of about 7million square metres, equivalent to 17Hong Kong Science Park, and significantly enhancing space for the development of the local I&T industry and start-ups. In addition, Lau Fau Shan will be positioned as a digital technology hub to capitalise on advanced technologies and promote integration of new and traditional economies, as well as to serve as an incubation base for young talent and start-ups. The NDAs within the NM are currently at various planning and construction stages. Based on the assumptions adopted at the planning stages, more than 500000 new jobs are expected to be created with the estimations of distribution by industry set out in the Annex. Regarding these new jobs, relevant bureaux and departments will provide corresponding local talent training programmes in response to the latest development and manpower requirements across various industries.

On housing, the NM will be the major source of future housing supply in Hong Kong, which is estimated to provide approximately 500000 new residential units to meet the demand for housing of families of different strata (including young families). The NDAs would also provide opportunities to respond to the public aspiration for larger home space. In line with the recommendations in the Hong Kong 2030+: Towards a Planning Vision and Strategy Transcending 2030 (Hong Kong 2030+), an enhanced home space by 10 to 20 per cent on average is assumed for the residential sites in the NDAs within the NM under more recent planning (including San Tin Technopole, Ngau Tam Mei, the Lau Fau Shan area, New Territories North New Town and Ma Tso Lung), offering flexibility for creating more quality living space in the future. In addition, we have allowed flexibility in adjusting the public/private split of housing supply in individual NDAs, taking into consideration the industry positioning of these NDAs and the needs of people from different strata. The respective public/private splits of housing supply in Kwu Tung North/Fanling North and Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDAs are approximately 70:30 and 60:40, with both public rental housing and subsidised sale flats in the public housing development. The public/private splits of housing supply in other NDAs will be flexibly determined at the later implementation stage, taking into account the positioning of respective NDAs and the overall supply and demand for public and private housing.

(4) On the childminding service, there will be 100 aided child care centre service places per 25000 general population in accordance with the planning ratio on a population basis, so as to cater for the service demand brought about by the population inflow in the NDAs within the NM. On youth support, one integrated children and youth services centre will be planned for every 12000children/young persons in the 6-24 age group. The NM could also provide suitable sites for relevant facilities such as Youth Post hostels and youth hostels, subject to policy support. In line with the policy objectives of the Youth Development Blueprint, the Government plans to build youth facility buildings and relevant facilities in the NM (for example, in Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA) to support youth development. The facilities will include venues for exchange, interaction and collaboration between young people from the Mainland and Hong Kong, spaces for youth interactions and activities, innovation and entrepreneurial bases for young people, and base facilities for youth uniformed groups. As for the planning of kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, please refer to the reply above."

HKMA announces second cohort of GenA.I. Sandbox to advance responsible AI innovation,2025-10-15 15:42,2025-10-15 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500258.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited (Cyberport), announced today (October 15) the second cohort of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenA.I.) Sandbox. Building on the foundation of the first cohort, this coming cohort demonstrates a significant industry shift from experimenting with AI's capability to enabling its secure and reliable implementation.

From over 60 proposals, a total of 27 use cases from 20 banks and 14 technology partners have been selected (see Annex). All submissions were prioritised based on innovation, technical complexity and potential value to the industry.

A defining theme of this cohort is the proactive approach to AI governance, with use cases pioneering ""AI vs AI"" strategies, such as leveraging AI to conduct automated quality checks on AI-generated outputs, improving accuracy and consistency at a scalable level.

In response to the emerging risk of deepfake-related fraud, the Sandbox will also serve as a testing ground for advanced defence mechanisms. Several participants will conduct adversarial simulations, using AI to stress-test and fortify their systems against sophisticated digital fraud.

  Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA Mr Arthur Yuen said, ""The second cohort represents a major leap forward in making AI adoption safer and more robust. The diverse representation of banks in this cohort highlights the industry-wide consensus on AI's transformative potential. The growth in collaboration between the banking, technology, and academic sectors is a testament to our commitment to fostering the local fintech ecosystem. I would also like to express my gratitude to Professor Chan (Note 1), Professor Yang (Note 2) and Professor Yiu (Note 3)for their valuable expert advice as members of the selection committee.""

Participants will gradually onboard to the designated platform by Cyberport's Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre later this year, with trials commencing in early 2026. Leveraging the GenA.I. Sandbox as the core, the HKMA will continue to share good practices and promote the responsible adoption of AI within the financial sector.

答覆：

主席：

詐騙是嚴重罪行。任何人干犯《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）第16A條「欺詐罪」，最高可判處監禁14年；若被控同一條例第17條「以欺騙手段取得財產」，最高可判處監禁10年。另外，任何人因詐騙得益而被控《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）第25條「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」，最高可判處監禁14年及罰款500萬元。

就議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局、財經事務及庫務局及通訊事務管理局辦公室（通訊辦），現回覆如下：

（一）電話智能卡實名登記制（實名登記制）第二階段於二○二二年實施，用戶可於同年三月起為其電話智能卡進行實名登記。警方自二○二二年所接獲的電話騙案數字如下：





二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年
二○二五年
			一至八月


案件（宗）
2 831
3 213
9 204
4 922




各類主要電話騙案的受害人年齡分布皆有所不同，就「假冒客服」及「猜猜我是誰」而言，二○二五年首八個月，超過一半受害人為60歲或以上，分別佔54%及58%。

二○二五年首八個月，超過七成涉及電話騙案的電話由本地打出。警方沒有就受害人的職業作分類統計。

防範騙案方面，警方持續分析最新騙案（包括電話騙案）的形勢及情報，適時發放最新防騙信息，包括透過記者會、警隊官方社交媒體帳號、守網者網站等平台向公眾介紹最新騙案手法，並向不同群組人士作針對性宣傳。

警方自二○二○年起推出防騙吉祥物「提子」，以親民互動的方式解釋騙徒的最新犯案手法及提供簡單易明的防騙信息，並在各社交媒體平台上發布以「提子」為題的防騙資訊，如《提子動畫廊》繪本等，亦安排「提子」在線下與青少年及中、小學生互動，以宣揚防騙信息，包括安排「提子入校園」，並以防騙宣傳車走訪中小學校園。

為加強防範學生及公眾誤墮電話及網絡詐騙陷阱，警方一直與電訊服務及社交媒體平台營辦商保持緊密溝通合作，包括透過電訊商派發防騙宣傳單張，並會不時更新防騙宣傳材料，提醒市民防範最新騙案手法。如發現有懷疑詐騙內容，警方會要求有關社交媒體平台即時移除，並採取適當的跟進行動。二○二五年一至八月，有關平台已按警方要求，審視及移除超過67 000個詐騙內容。

針對長者及退休人士方面，警方以「健康生活、遠離詐騙、幸運常伴」為主題，向長者及退休人士社群宣傳防騙信息，尤其是防範電話騙案，當中包括與體檢中心及衛生署長者健康中心合作推送防騙資訊、透過社福機構網絡及關愛隊等向長者派發防騙資訊包等。警方亦繼續透過耆樂警訊及其他社區網絡舉行防騙活動，其中耆樂警訊於二○二五年五月推出「耆樂科技隊長」訓練，內容包括學習使用「防騙視伏APP」，讓長者認識最新的騙案手法和網絡陷阱，鼓勵他們於社區宣揚防騙信息。

針對新來港人士及內地學生等電話騙案高危群組，警方早前與國家移民管理局、公安部刑事偵查局及香港入境事務處共同製作防騙視頻，並自二○二五年六月起在各口岸、內地出入境辦證大廳、小紅書、抖音等播放。警方亦透過入境處六個總區公眾服務站、勞工及福利局及各大專院校向新來港人士派發防騙宣傳小冊子及單張，當中包括防範電話騙案的方法。警方亦已推出「網上學習套件」，供包括新來港人士和內地學生了解騙案手法和應對建議。

另外，警方於二○二五年八月與Facebook及WhatsApp的母公司Meta舉行聯合記者會，發布涉及通訊軟件及社交網絡平台的最新騙案手法，以及營辦商的反詐措施，包括加強使用人工智能技術偵測和移除詐騙內容及帳號。

（二）至（四）自實名登記制於二○二三年二月全面實施以來，通訊辦一直按運作經驗持續推出不同優化措施，包括要求電訊商自二○二四年十月起以「智方便」作為香港身份證持有人在實名登記制下的預設登記方式。至於非持有香港身份證人士在網上登記平台進行實名登記的電話儲值卡，電訊商會先透過系統識別證件後啓動相關電話儲值卡，之後會以人手檢查所提供證件的真偽，如發現不合規登記的電話儲值卡會取消其登記。此外，所有電訊商必須定期抽查已登記的電話卡資料及加強核查可疑個案，並將涉嫌違法個案交予警方處理。截至二○二五年八月底，約520萬張電話儲值卡因客戶未能提供合乎登記要求的資料而被拒絕登記，另外有約367萬張未能遵從合規要求的電話儲值卡被取消登記。

政府正全面檢視實名登記制的整體運作，並於二○二五年七月向立法會資訊科技及廣播事務委員會介紹加強建議，包括大幅減少個人用戶（不論是香港居民或是非香港居民）可登記電話儲值卡的數量上限，由現時每人可向每間電訊商最多登記10張減至三張，並訂立新罪行打擊不當使用已登記的電話智能卡的行為。政府正檢視所收集的意見，並積極籌備法例草擬工作，以期在二○二六年向立法會提交相關法例修訂建議以供審議。

（五）警方針對騙徒常用的傀儡戶口作出重點打擊，摧毀詐騙產業鏈。二○二五年首八個月共拘捕4 906人涉及詐騙及洗黑錢罪行，當中約七成為傀儡戶口持有人。警方已調動人手及資源盡快處理涉及傀儡戶口的案件，並配合律政司加快檢控進度。

此外，警方自二○二三年底起，就涉及傀儡戶口的案件向法庭申請引用《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》第27條加重刑罰。截至二○二五年八月底，共169名傀儡戶口持有人的刑期增加一成至三成多，最終被判監21至75個月不等。警方會繼續宣傳成功加重刑罰的案例，以進一步加強阻嚇力。

警方亦與金融管理局（金管局）及銀行業界推出多項措施打擊犯罪集團利用傀儡戶口清洗黑錢，包括於二○二三年六月推出Financial Intelligence Evaluation Sharing Tool（FINEST），為銀行業界提供安全有效的電子平台，交換懷疑與金融罪行相關的企業客戶數據。警方亦為市民大眾及不同社群舉辦具針對性的宣傳教育活動，例如金管局及銀行業界合作，於零售銀行櫃位擺放反洗黑錢桌面展示架及貼紙，提醒有意開戶人士切勿跌入「租、借、賣戶口」的陷阱，並安排宣傳車走訪各區向市民派發宣傳物品。

此外，金管局一直密切關注詐騙和洗錢活動風險，並與銀行業界、執法機構及其他監管機構緊密合作，推出一系列措施，加強打擊詐騙活動，特別針對不法分子用作洗錢的傀儡戶口網絡。這些措施包括要求銀行更全面使用警方防騙視伏器數據，提早識別可疑帳戶並向客戶提示相關風險；修訂《銀行業條例》，促進銀行間資料分享；以及向銀行提供詳細指引，列明保障客戶及打擊傀儡戶口的良好做法。金管局亦致力進行宣傳教育，包括透過主要社交媒體發放帖文，以及與銀行業和執法機構進行一系列「切勿借／賣戶口」的宣傳工作，增加市民對打擊洗黑錢的認知和提升防範意識。

政府會繼續善用現有法例採取針對性行動打擊傀儡戶口，並密切留意相關成效，適時考慮是否需要檢視現有法例。

（六）法律改革委員會（法改會）轄下的小組委員會於二○二二年十月完成首階段關於依賴電腦網絡的罪行和司法管轄權的公眾諮詢工作，目前正進行第二階段研究，聚焦於利用電腦網絡擴大犯罪規模的傳統罪行。政府會密切留意法改會的研究進展和最終建議。

另一方面，香港警方一直採取積極措施，調查和收集情報以打擊詐騙罪行。警方並會加強與其他執法機構和相關持份者合作，共同打擊涉及詐騙的犯罪團伙及跨境／跨國犯罪組織。

其中，反詐騙跨境合作平台「FRONTIER+」自二○二四年十月起成立，至今成員包括澳洲、加拿大、香港特別行政區、印尼、澳門特別行政區、馬來西亞、馬爾代夫、新加坡、南韓以及泰國共10個國家及地區。在今年四月首次聯合行動中，「FRONTIER+」成功識別並瓦解多個跨境詐騙網絡，共拘捕 1 858人，涉及9 200多宗騙案，損失逾15億港元，行動中亦凍結32 000多個銀行戶口，攔截約1.6億港元騙款。

（七）金管局計劃透過兩個指定平台以促進《2025年銀行業（修訂）條例》下銀行之間分享資料。主要的平台是由警方運作的FINEST，目前已有10家銀行使用該平台來分享企業帳戶的資料。FINEST平台正進行升級，以便容納個人帳戶的資料分享。當升級完成時，10家銀行將會過渡到新的升級平台。另一個平台是由香港銀行同業結算有限公司旗下子公司運作的資訊平台，稱為ICLNet。金管局的初期目標是先讓上述10家銀行使用ICLNet作帳戶資料分享。目前，FINEST及ICLNet已經被銀行業界廣泛使用，因此業界對於使用這些平台並不陌生。金管局亦計劃逐步增加參與銀行的數目以加強資料分享成效。

金管局正與警方和銀行業界緊密合作，完成相關的準備工作，包括FINEST的系統提升和制定相關指引，目的是在條例生效後盡快落實措施，透過更廣泛的信息交換，進一步提升銀行打擊詐騙的能力。

（八）跨境徵信互通

自金管局與中國人民銀行於二○二四年推出跨境徵信互通業務試點安排以來，金管局一直與香港銀行和徵信業界跟進，落實及優化包括企業及個人層面的試點個案的測試工作，包括於今年四月起在流程上結合了深港跨境數據驗證平台的應用。數據南下方面，試點安排至今已協助超過20宗企業及個人客戶完成2.6億港元的貸款審批，及超過200間企業完成「認識你的客戶」及開戶程序。隨着試點安排至今已取得顯著進展，金管局於二○二五年十月十日舉辦了業界研討會，宣布將跨境徵信互通業務試點常規化，支持業界將現階段試點成果產品化，推出以市場為本的跨境徵信解決方案。同時，為滿足市場需要和反饋，金管局將繼續與人民銀行及其他內地有關部門保持密切聯繫，共同協作優化跨境徵信互通和深港跨境數據驗證平台，探討更多不同渠道落實企業和個人徵信信息的跨境傳輸，最終惠及內地與香港的企業及居民，服務實體經濟。

深港跨境數據驗證平台

深港跨境數據驗證平台利用區塊鏈等先進科技，為銀行提供安全、創新的方法驗證客戶自主攜帶的跨境數據。驗證平台自二○二四年五月在金管局與內地相關部委共同推動下成功上線試行後已經服務超過10家銀行和徵信機構，並落地超過10個業務場景，當中包括支持香港銀行驗證內地居民及企業提供的文件以更有效地進行開立帳戶及審批貸款相關的盡職審查及風險管理工作。

為了令銀行更方便使用驗證平台服務，金管局推動平台與商業數據通（CDI）在今年四月對接，有助銀行利用現有的CDI接口，更簡單直接使用平台。金管局將會繼續與政府和內地監管機構以及業界探索驗證平台的進一步發展，推進驗證平台在數據源和數據種類、大灣區內覆蓋範圍以及客戶體驗和介面等多方面的提升與擴容，便利香港銀行向在港的內地居民及企業提供銀行服務及管理相關風險。"
LCQ9: Stepping up efforts to combat fraud,2025-10-15 15:08,2025-10-15 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500368.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Carmen Kan and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

According to data from the Hong Kong Police Force, there were 20 760 ‍deception cases in Hong Kong in the first half of this year, representing a 4.3 per cent increase compared to the same period last year, and accounting for about 48 per cent of the overall crime figure. Regarding stepping up efforts to combat fraud, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of telephone fraud cases reported to the police annually since the implementation of the Real-name Registration Programme for Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) Cards, with a breakdown by whether the SIM cards held by the fraudsters were registered to Hong Kong residents, and the age groups and occupational backgrounds of the victims; the publicity strategies adopted by the authorities to prevent fraud among different groups of people and whether an assessment has been conducted on their effectiveness;

(2) as some members of the industry have pointed out that the frequent occurrence of fraud cases stems from vulnerabilities in the first line of defence where telecommunications operators verify the identities of SIM card users, whether the authorities will study ways to strengthen the relevant identity verification requirements, such as mandating that telecommunications operators must verify original copies of customers' identity documents on the spot before issuing SIM cards, and explore feasible solutions to effectively detect the authenticity of the identity documents used by customers for registration; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as the Government indicated at the meeting of the Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting of this Council on July 14 this year that it intended to amend legislation to combat the improper use of registered SIM cards, of the current progress of the legislative amendment exercise and the legislative timetable;

(4) when carrying out the legislative amendment exercise as mentioned in (3), whether the Government will study setting separate upper limits on the total number of SIM cards that can be registered by Hong Kong residents and visitors, in order to step up the combat against telephone fraud; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) as it is learnt that places such as the Mainland and Singapore have enacted specific legislation to prohibit activities such as the sale or rental of bank accounts in order to step up the combat against stooge accounts, whether the authorities will make reference to such experiences and study the feasibility of enacting specific legislation; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(6) as the Law Reform Commission (LRC) recommended the extra-territorial application of Hong Kong law to certain offences in the Consultation Paper on Cyber-Dependent Crimes and Jurisdictional Issues published in 2022, and in order to combat cross-border crimes more effectively, including the resale of SIM cards to lawbreakers outside Hong Kong, whether the authorities will make reference to LRC's recommendations to incorporate an ""extraterritoriality"" provision into relevant legislation as appropriate; if so, of the details; if not, what other effective strategies the authorities have in place to address cross-border fraud crimes;

(7) as the Banking (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, which took effect on November 3 this year, introduces a voluntary mechanism for banks to share information of corporate and individual accounts via electronic means with other banks and relevant law enforcement agencies through secure platforms designated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) when they become aware of suspected prohibited conduct (e.g. money laundering), thereby better protecting the public from fraud, of the details of the secure platform designated by the HKMA (including the current progress of the system's preparation); the number of institutions that have so far confirmed their participation in this mechanism to share account information; and

(8) to effectively assist Hong Kong banks in verifying the identities of Mainland residents and enterprises in Hong Kong and properly carrying out the ""Know Your Customer"" procedures, so as to prevent individuals from opening accounts and obtaining fraudulent loans in Hong Kong through unlawful means, what is the current progress of implementing Cross Boundary Credit Referencing and the Shenzhen-Hong Kong cross-boundary data validation platform, and whether any performance indicators have been set for these initiatives?

Reply:

President,

Deception is a serious crime. Any person who commits the offence of ""fraud"" under section 16A of the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) is liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years, while any person charged with ""obtaining property by deception"" under section 17 of the same Ordinance is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years. In addition, any person charged with ""dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" under section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) for proceeds of deception is liable to maximum penalties of 14 years' imprisonment and a fine of $5 million.

  In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) The second phrase for the Real-name Registration Programme for Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) Cards (RNR Programme)'s second phase was implemented in 2022, enabling users to start real-name registration of their SIM cards since March 2022. The number of telephone scam cases reported to the Police since 2022 is as follows:





2022
2023
2024
January to August 2025


Number of cases
2831
3213
9204
4922




The age distribution of victims varies across different types of major telephone scam cases. For ""impersonation of customer service staff"" and ""guess who"" cases, over half of the victims in the first eight months of 2025 were aged 60 or above, accounting for 54 per cent and 58 per cent respectively.

More than 70 per cent of the calls involved in telephone scam cases in the first eight months of 2025 originated from Hong Kong. The Police do not maintain a breakdown of the statistics on the victims by occupation.

Regarding scam prevention, the Police have been analysing the trends and intelligence of latest scam cases (including telephone scams), and have been releasing the latest anti-scam messages in a timely manner, including making use of platforms such as press conferences, social media accounts of the Police and the CyberDefender website to warn the public about the latest scam tactics. Targeted publicity was also launched for different groups of people.

The Police have introduced an anti-scam mascot ""The Little Grape"" since 2020 to explain the latest tactics of fraudsters and to disseminate simple, easy-to-understand anti-scam messages in a friendly and interactive manner. Anti-scam information is posted on different social media platforms using ""The Little Grape"" as the theme, such as ""The Little Grape"" Animation Picture book. Also, offline interactions between ""The Little Grape"" and primary and secondary students are arranged through visits to primary and secondary schools by ""The Little Grape"" and the anti-scam promotional vehicle to convey anti-scam messages.

To heighten the alertness of students and the public against telephone and online scams and pitfalls, the Police have been maintaining close communication and collaboration with telecommunications service providers (TSP) and social media platform operators. In particular, anti-scam promotional leaflets are distributed through TSPs. The promotional materials are updated from time to time, so as to remind members of the public to be watchful over the latest fraud tactics. Should suspected fraudulent content be found, the Police will request the social media platforms concerned to immediately remove the content and take appropriate follow-up actions. From January to August of 2025, the platforms concerned have reviewed and removed over 67 000 items of fraudulent content at the request of the Police.

For the elderly and retirees, the Police deliver anti-scam messages, in particular those on prevention of telephone scams, to these groups under the theme of ""live healthily and stay away from scams; good fortune is always around"". Specifically, the Police collaborate with health examination centres and Elderly Health Centres of the Department of Health to disseminate anti-scam information, and distribute anti-scam information packs to the elderly with the aid of social welfare organisation networks and the Care Teams. The Police also continue to organise anti-scam activities through the Senior Police Call and other community networks. Among others, the Senior Police Call launched the ""IT Captain"" training programme in May 2025, the content of which included teaching the elderly how to use the ""Scameter+"", enabling them to be aware of the latest scam tactics and cyber pitfalls and encouraging them to spread scam prevention messages in the community.

Targeting high-risk groups of telephone scam victims such as new arrivals and Mainland students, the Police have earlier on produced anti-scam video clips in collaboration with the National Immigration Administration, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and the Immigration Department (ImmD) of Hong Kong. Starting from June 2025, the videos are broadcast across boundary control points, exit-entry service halls on the Mainland as well as Xiaohongshu, Douyin, etc. In addition, the Police distribute anti-scam booklets and leaflets to new arrivals through the six regional public service counters of the ImmD, the Labour and Welfare Bureau and various tertiary institutions. These materials include methods to prevent telephone scams. The Police have also launched an online learning package for new arrivals, Mainland students, etc, to learn about the scam tactics and advise them on counter measures.

Besides, the Police held a joint press conference with Meta, the parent company of Facebook and WhatsApp, in August 2025 to alert the public of the latest scam tactics involving messaging applications and social networking platforms. The public were also notified of the operators' anti-scam counter measures, which include the strengthened use of artificial intelligence technology for detecting and removing fraudulent content and accounts.

(2) to (4) Since the full implementation of the RNR Programme in February 2023, the OFCA has introduced various enhancement measures based on operational experience, including requiring TSPs to adopt ""iAM Smart"" as the default registration method for Hong Kong Identity (HKID) card holders since October 2024. For non-HKID holders registering pre-paid SIM cards (PPS cards) under the RNR Programme via an online registration platform, TSPs will first verify the identification documents through their system and then activate the relevant PPS cards, followed by manual checks to verify the authenticity of the identification documents provided. Any PPS cards found to be non-compliant with the regulatory requirements will have their registration cancelled. In addition, all TSPs are required to conduct regular sampling checks on the registered PPS card information, strengthen the verification of suspicious cases and refer suspected illegal cases to the Police for further handling. As at end-August 2025, around 5.2 million PPS cards were rejected for registration as clients failed to provide information in compliance with the registration requirements, and the registration records of about 3.67 million non-compliant PPS cards were deregistered.

The Government is comprehensively reviewing the overall implementation of the RNR Programme. In July 2025, the Government briefed the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting on the enhancement proposals, which include significantly reducing the maximum number of registered PPS cards allowed for each individual user (both Hong Kong resident and non-Hong Kong resident) from 10 PPS cards per TSP per person to 3 PPS cards per TSP per person, and introducing new offences to combat improper uses of registered SIM cards. The Government is currently reviewing the feedback collected and actively preparing for the drafting of legislation, with a view to submitting the proposed legislative amendments to the LegCo for scrutiny in 2026.

(5) The Police have taken targeted enforcement actions against stooge accounts frequently used by fraudsters in order to destroy the fraud industry chain. In the first eight months of 2025, a total of 4 906 people were arrested for fraud and money laundering offences, of which about 70 per cent of the arrestees are stooge account holders. The Police have deployed manpower and allocated resources to expedite the handling of cases involving stooge accounts and are working with the Department of Justice to speed up the prosecution process.

Furthermore, since end-2023, the Police have applied to the courts for invocation of section 27 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance to seek enhanced penalties for cases involving stooge accounts. As at end-August 2025, the sentences of 169 stooge account holders have been enhanced by 10 per cent to more than 30 per cent, with terms of imprisonment ranging from 21 to 75 months. The Police will continue to publicise the cases with successful application for enhanced sentences to further increase the deterrent effect.

The Police have also launched a number of measures with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the banking sector to combat money laundering activities by criminal syndicates using stooge accounts. These include the Financial Intelligence Evaluation Sharing Tool (FINEST) launched in June 2023. This electronic platform provides a secure and efficient means for sharing data of corporate clients related to suspected financial crimes among the banking institutions. The Police also organise targeted publicity and education activities for members of the public and various groups in the community. For instance, with the collaboration of the HKMA and the banking sector, desktop display stands and stickers with anti-money laundering messages are placed at counters of retail banks to remind those intending to open bank accounts not to fall into the trap of ""renting, lending or selling their accounts"". Additionally, a promotional truck was arranged to tour around various districts, distributing publicity materials to members of the public.

Moreover, the HKMA has been closely monitoring the risks of scams and money laundering activities, and has worked closely with the banking industry, law enforcement agencies and other regulators to launch a series of measures to combat scams, specifically targeting stooge account networks that are used by criminals for money laundering. These measures include requiring banks to expand their use of the Police's Scameter database to identify suspicious accounts early and alert customers of the associated risks, amendments to the Banking Ordinance to facilitate information sharing among banks, and issuance of detailed guidelines to banks on good practices for protecting customers and combating stooge accounts. Furthermore, the HKMA has stepped up publicity and education efforts, including issuing social media posts and collaborating with banks and law enforcement agencies to organise a series of outreach activities under the campaign ""Don’t Lend/Sell Your Accounts"", with a view to raising awareness among members of the public about anti-money laundering and anti-scam.

The Government will continue to make good use of the existing legislations to combat stooge accounts through targeted actions, closely monitor their effectiveness and consider in a timely manner the need to review the existing legislations.

(6) A sub-committee set up under the Law Reform Commission (LRC) completed the first stage of public consultation on cyber-dependent crimes and jurisdictional issues in October 2022. The LRC is now conducting the second stage of the study, focusing on the traditional crime of leveraging computer network to expand the scope of criminal activities. The Government will closely monitor the progress of the LRC's study and the final recommendations made by the LRC.

Meanwhile, the Police have been taking proactive measures in investigation and intelligence gathering in order to combat the offence of fraud. The Police will also strengthen collaboration with other law enforcement agencies and relevant stakeholders to jointly combat criminal syndicates and cross-boundary/transnational criminal organisations involved in fraudulent activities.

Among others, the cross-border anti-fraud collaboration platform ""FRONTIER+"" was established in October 2024. As of now, the platform comprises a total of 10 countries and regions, namely Australia, Canada, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Indonesia, Macao Special Administrative Region, Malaysia, the Maldives, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand, as its members. During the first joint operation in April this year, ""FRONTIER+"" successfully identified and dismantled multiple cross-border fraud syndicates, resulting in the arrest of a total of 1 858 people, who were involved in more than 9 200 fraud cases and a total loss amounting to over HK$1.5 billion. More than 32 000 bank accounts were frozen and approximately HK$160 million fraudulent funds were intercepted during the operation.

(7) The HKMA intends to facilitate information sharing among banks under the Banking (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 (the Ordinance) through two designated platforms. The main platform is FINEST operated by the Police, which is already in use by 10 banks for sharing information of corporate accounts. FINEST is currently being upgraded to accommodate information sharing on individual accounts and the 10 banks will transition to the new upgraded platform when it is launched. The other platform is ICLNet, an information platform operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited. The intention of the HKMA is to let the aforementioned 10 banks to use ICLNet for sharing information in the initial stage. Currently, FINEST and ICLNet have been widely used by the banking sector and banks are not unfamiliar with using these platforms. The HKMA also plans to gradually increase the number of participating banks in order to enhance the effectiveness of information sharing.

The HKMA is now working closely with the Police and the banking sector to complete the relevant preparatory work, including the system upgrade of FINEST and formulation of relevant guidelines. The objective is to implement the measures as soon as practicable after the Ordinance comes into operation to further enhance banks' ability to combat fraud through wider information sharing.

(8) Cross-boundary Credit Referencing (CBCR)

Following the launch of the pilot programme of the CBCR initiative by the HKMA and the People's Bank of China (PBoC) in 2024, the HKMA has been following up with local banks and credit reference agencies to implement and optimise the testing of end-to-end data transmission workflows for corporate and personal customers, which included the integration of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong cross-boundary data validation platform into the processing workflows in April 2025. So far, Southbound data transfers under the pilot programme have facilitated over 20 corporate and personal loans approval amounting to more than HK$260 million, and the ""Know-Your-Customer"" (KYC) and account opening processes of over 200 businesses. Following the successful pilot outcomes, the HKMA hosted an industry symposium on October 10, 2025 to announce, among others, the regularisation of the CBCR initiative, with a view to supporting the industry in productising the pilot outcomes into market-driven solutions. Based on market needs and feedback, the HKMA will continue to maintain close liaison with the PBoC and other relevant Mainland authorities to explore possible enhancements to the initiatives to facilitate more efficient and scalable transfer, which will in turn benefit businesses and residents on the Mainland and Hong Kong, and contribute to the real economy.

Shenzhen-Hong Kong cross-boundary data validation platform (DVP)

The DVP utilises advanced technologies such as blockchain to enable banks to validate the authenticity of cross-boundary data presented by their customers in a safe and innovative way. Since pilot launching in May 2024 with the support of the HKMA and relevant mainland authorities, the DVP has already provided services to over 10 banks and credit reference agencies and implemented more than 10 business scenarios, including to support Hong Kong banks to validate documents provided by Mainland residents and enterprises to conduct due diligence and risk management work related to account opening and loan approval in a more effective manner.

To make it more convenient for banks to use the DVP, the HKMA facilitated its connection with the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI) in April this year, allowing banks to more simply and directly access the DVP's services leveraging the existing CDI interface. The HKMA will continue to work with the government, relevant Mainland regulatory authorities and the industry to explore further enhancements and development of the DVP in terms of data types and sources, geographic coverage within the Greater Bay Area and customer experience and user interface, with a view to facilitating Hong Kong banks to provide banking services to Mainland residents and enterprises in Hong Kong while managing the related risks."
港鐵公司小蠔灣站項目地基工程獲准復工,2025-10-15 15:00,2025-10-15 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500221.htm,"​政府發言人今日（十月十五日）表示，香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）位於大嶼山擬新建的小蠔灣站項目的嵌岩工字鋼樁工程已獲准今日復工。

發言人表示，由於港鐵東涌綫近小蠔灣車廠的一段以道碴承托的路軌有五個監測點於七月十五日的上升記錄超逾20毫米的預設停工指標，上述小蠔灣站項目的嵌岩工字鋼樁工程於同日暫停。有關情況是在預設機制下發生，目的是監察鐵路附近範圍工程對運行中鐵路的潛在影響，一旦發現超出預設指標，便會要求暫時停工及探討緩解措施，以保障鐵路安全。政府於七月十七日公布情況（www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/17/P2025071700594.htm），按既定程序，只有在屋宇署滿意項目團隊的緩解措施；機電工程署（機電署）滿意港鐵公司已強化監測措施；以及港鐵公司確認復工不會對鐵路結構和運作安全構成影響，政府才會批准復工。

小蠔灣站項目的註冊建築專業人士早前向屋宇署提交了事件報告，以及緩解措施和連帶的修訂圖則。屋宇署經審視後同意緩解措施和修訂圖則，認為緩解措施能有效減低復工後相關路軌的上升及沉降幅度超越預設停工指標的可能性，並接納港鐵公司的加強監測措施。

機電署已檢視港鐵公司所提交有關鐵路運作安全的監察數據和評估報告，確認鐵路狀況及港鐵公司的監測措施符合安全運作要求。

此外，港鐵公司確認復工不會對鐵路設施結構及鐵路運作安全構成影響。

屋宇署和機電署人員於十月八日午夜視察相關的路軌，再次確認七月事件後完成的維護工程和修整的道碴軌段水平，均沒有對鐵路設施的結構安全和運作安全構成影響。

屋宇署、機電署及港鐵公司會繼續密切監察有關情況，包括繼續根據預設停工指標監察相關上升及沉降幅度，確保鐵路設施結構和鐵路運作安全。"

答覆：

主席：

就陳沛良議員的提問，現回覆如下：

政府按去年十二月口腔健康及牙科護理工作小組的發展策略建議，從而訂立口腔健康行動計劃。「社區牙科支援計劃」（支援計劃）自今年五月二十六日推出，屬於「做窄做深」策略，即聚焦幫助較難獲得服務的弱勢社群提供資助牙科服務的一項措施。現時每名合資格計劃參加者每180天可在計劃下申請接受資助牙科服務一次，資助服務範圍涵蓋預防性和治療性的口腔健康及牙科護理服務。如主診註冊牙醫評估後認為情況合適，計劃參加者可獲得指定的資助牙科服務，包括口腔檢查、緩解牙齒疼痛的藥物（如需要）、X光檢查、補牙和拔牙。

截至十月一日，共3 262名合資格人士參與計劃。所有計劃參加者除接受口腔檢查外，亦接受了一項或多於一項牙科服務，當中1 161名參加者獲處方緩解牙齒疼痛的藥物、2 235名接受了X光檢查、1 958名接受了補牙服務及1 059名接受了拔牙服務。

「2021年口腔健康調查」結果 顯示，每名香港成年人（35歲至44歲群組）及非居於院舍長者（65歲至74歲群組）分別平均有0.7顆及1.2顆未經治療的蛀牙。按調查結果，政府設定計劃下每名參加者每180天最多可獲三個「補牙或拔牙配額」，每個「補牙或拔牙配額」以一顆牙齒為單位。現時每名參加者平均使用1.8個「補牙或拔牙配額」， 1 808名（55%）參加者未有使用全數三個「補牙或拔牙配額」，而1 454名（45%）參加者已使用三個相關配額。這反映現時服務安排大致可應付參加者的需求。

參加者可按其意願選擇於18區任何服務點申請接受資助牙科服務，各區參與的共32間非政府組織在18區的服務點數目和參加者人數分區數字表列如下：

就推行支援計劃及「青少年護齒共同治理先導計劃」，政府於二○二五至二六年度的財政撥款合共為1.363億元。自該計劃於五月二十六日推出至今，政府沒有收到參加者的投訴。

截至十月一日，支援計劃已提供4 390次補牙服務和1 626次拔牙服務，兩者的比例約為三比一，反映計劃成功引導參加者在牙醫認為合適的情況下保存牙齒，符合現時政府口腔健康及牙科護理的策略。

支援計劃將於明年起擴闊受惠對象至無家者及擴大服務範圍，並將新增洗牙、根管治療（杜牙根）、移除牙橋和牙冠，以及鑲配活動假牙服務，為有經濟困難的弱勢社群提供更多預防性和治療性的資助牙科服務。支援計劃會於二○二六年接替關愛基金「長者牙科服務資助」項目，該項目將於二○二六年一月一日起停止接受申請。

現時共有32間非政府組織參與計劃，在79個服務點為合資格參加者提供服務，覆蓋全港18區，服務大致足夠應付需求。計劃自推出以來，衞生署一直積極於地區層面推廣計劃，包括為地區服務及關愛隊伍舉行簡介會、於18區的長者地區中心、長者鄰舍中心及綜合家庭服務中心舉辦口腔健康講座及宣傳計劃內容，並為合資格人士提供即場預約服務。而參與計劃的非政府組織亦會透過其網絡、與地區社福機構合作及舉辦外展活動等，積極向服務對象宣傳計劃，擴大計劃的社區覆蓋面。

政府會持續監察服務使用量和需求，適時檢討計劃並按需要及考慮所需資源，研究增添服務單位及服務點。"

Resumption of foundation works for MTRCL Oyster Bay Station project,2025-10-15 15:00,2025-10-15 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500226.htm,"âA Government spokesman said today (October 15) that consent has been given to resume the socketed steel H-pile works of the proposed MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) Oyster Bay Station project on Lantau Island today.

The spokesman said that since the upheaving readings recorded on July 15 at five monitoring checkpoints installed on a section of the MTRCL's Tung Chung Line (TCL) ballasted railway tracks near Siu Ho Wan Depot had exceeded the preset trigger level of 20 millimetres for works suspension, the socketed steel H-pile works of the aforementioned project were suspended on the same day. The situation occurred under the preset mechanism that aims to monitor the potential impact of construction works in the vicinity ofrailways under operation. Once the exceedance of the preset trigger level is observed, works will be suspended, and mitigation measures will be explored, ensuring the safety of the railway. The Government announced the situation on July 17 (www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/17/P2025071700605.htm). In accordance with the established procedures, resumption of works will only be allowed when the Buildings Department (BD) is satisfied with the mitigation measures adopted by the project team; the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) is satisfied with the enhanced monitoring measures by the MTRCL; and the MTRCL has confirmed that the resumption of works will not affect the structural safety of the railway facilities and the safety of the railway operation.

The registered building professional of the Oyster Bay Station project has earlier submitted to the BD an incident report, a proposal of mitigation measures and the associated amendment plans. After review, the BD has agreed to the mitigation measures and the amendment plans, as these measures can effectively minimise the potential risk of the upheaval and settlement of the relevant tracks beyond the preset threshold upon the resumption of works, and has accepted the enhanced monitoring measures taken by the MTRCL.

The EMSD has reviewed the monitoring data and assessment report submitted by the MTRCL in relation to the safe operation of the railway and confirmed that the condition of the railway and the MTRCL's monitoring measures meet the operational safety requirements.

In addition, the MTRCL has confirmed that the resumption of works will not affect the structural safety of the railway facilities and the safe operation of the railway.

The staff of the BD and the EMSD inspected the concerned railway tracks at midnight on October 8, and reconfirmed that the maintenance works completed and the reconditioned ballast track after the incident of July had no impact on the structural safety of the railway facilities and operational safety of the railway.

  The BD, the EMSD and the MTRCL will continue to closely monitor the situation, including the continuous monitoring of upheaval and settlement levels against the triggering limit, to ensure the structural safety of the railway facilities and the safe operation of the railway."

Question:

  Since May 26 this year, the Government has launched the Community Dental Support Programme (the Programme) in collaboration with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to promote early identification and timely intervention of dental diseases among the underprivileged groups with financial difficulties through provision of subsidised services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers, genders and ages of participants, as well as the distribution of their selected NGO-operated dental clinics (broken down by the 18 districts across the territory) since the launch of the Programme; the respective numbers of participants who have received the following specified subsidised dental services: (i) oral health assessment, (ii) medication for dental pain relief, (iii) X-ray examination and (iv) dental filling or extraction, and among which the number of participants who have used up the three ""Teeth Filling/Extraction Quotas"" within the 180-day cycle;

(2) of the respective (i) number of participating NGOs, and (ii) the number of dental service points and their distribution in the 18 districts across the territory since the launch of the Programme;

(3) of the financial provision earmarked by the Government for the Programme and the specific expenditure incurred since the launch of the Programme;

(4) whether the Government has received complaints from participants since the launch of the Programme; if so, of the main issues involved, as well as the Government's handling procedures; and

(5) whether the various indicators have met the Government's expectations since the launch of the Programme; of the measures put in place by the Government to encourage more NGOs and dental service points to participate, so that the service points can be distributed more evenly across districts to meet the demand for dental services from eligible persons?

Reply:

President,

  The reply in response to the question raised by the Hon Chan Pui-leung is as follows:

  The Government formulated the Oral Health Action Plan according to the development strategies and recommendations made by the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care in December last year. The Community Dental Support Programme (CDSP) was launched on May 26 this year, as part of the strategy of essential dental care services targeting underprivileged groups, focusing on providing subsidised dental services to underprivileged with difficulties in accessing dental care. Currently, each eligible participant can apply for subsidised dental services which cover both preventive and curative oral health and dental care services once every 180 days under the CDSP. Subject to the assessment by the attending registered dentist, a participant will be provided with specified subsidised dental services, including oral health assessment, medication for dental pain relief (when necessary), X-ray examination and dental fillings and extractions.

  As of October 1, a total of 3 262 eligible persons have participated in the CDSP. In addition to oral health assessments, all participants received one or more dental services: 1 161 of them were prescribed medication for dental pain relief, 2 235 received X-ray examinations, 1 958 received dental fillings, and 1 059 received extractions.

  The results of the Oral Health Survey 2021 showed that each adult (35 to 44 years old age group) and non-institutionalised older person (65 to 74 years old age group) in Hong Kong had an average of 0.7 and 1.2 untreated decay teeth respectively. Based on the results of the survey, the Government has set a maximum of three ""Teeth Filling/Extraction Quotas"" (Quotas) for each participant every 180 days under CDSP, with each Quota covering treatment for one tooth. Currently, each participant is using an average of 1.8 Quotas. 1 808 of the participants (55 per cent) have not used all three Quotas, while 1 454 of them (45 per cent) have used up the three Quotas, reflecting that the current service capacity can generally meet the demands of participants.

  Participants can choose any service point in the 18 districts to apply for subsidised dental services. The number of service points operated by the total of 32 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 18 districts and the number of participants in each of the districts are tabled below:

  The financial provision in 2025 -26 for the implementation of the CDSP and the Primary Dental Co-care Pilot Scheme for Adolescents is $136.3 million. Since the launch of the CDSP on May 26, the Government has received no complaints from participants.

  As of October 1, the CDSP provided 4 390 dental fillings and 1 626 extractions. The ratio of the two is approximately three to one, which reflects that the CDSP has successfully guided participants towards tooth retention when the dentist considers it suitable, aligning with the Government's prevailing strategies on oral health and dental care.

  The CDSP will expand the beneficiary list from next year to cover the homeless, and expand its scope of services to include dental scalings, root canal treatments, removal of bridges and crowns as well as removable denture fittings, further enhancing subsidised preventive and curative dental services for the underprivileged with financial difficulties. The CDSP will supplant Community Care Fund Elderly Dental Assistance Programme (EDAP) in 2026. The EDAP will cease accepting applications from January 1, 2026.

  Currently, there is a total of 32 NGOs participating in the CDSP, providing services to eligible participants in 79 service points covering all 18 districts in Hong Kong. The service is generally sufficient to meet the demand. Since the launch of the CDSP, the Department of Health has been actively promoting the programme at the community level. This includes conducting briefings to district services and community care teams, holding oral health talks and promoting the programme in District Elderly Community Centres, Neighbourhood Elderly Centres and Integrated Family Service Centres in 18 districts, and providing on-site appointment booking services for eligible persons. In addition, participating NGOs have also utilised their network, collaborated with other community social welfare organisations and conducted outreaching activities, among other things, with a view to promoting the CDSP to target users and expanding the community coverage of the programme.

  The Government will continue to monitor the service usage and demand of the CDSP, timely review the programme and explore addition of service units and service points having regard to the demand and required resources."

聯合演習模擬一艘運油船和一艘貨櫃船相撞，導致運油船溢漏燃油，以及五個載有氫氧化鈉的貨櫃墮海。其後，油污應變小組到場清理溢漏在海面的油污，而消防處及其他應變小組亦被派往現場，在有需要時控制及處理有可能泄漏的氫氧化鈉，以免對附近環境和設施造成威脅。

演習中，各參與單位採取了一連串的模擬應變行動。在模擬油污事故發生後，運油船在南丫島下尾灣對開海面拋錨，救險隊伍轉卸損毀船艙的燃油和堵塞漏油裂縫，從源頭堵截燃油溢漏。此外，油污清理隊伍以圍油欄包圍運油船，並用圍油欄在運油船附近架設海上屏障，防止油污擴散。演習亦展示油污清理船隻和政府飛行服務隊直升機以水模擬向漂散在海面的油污噴灑化油劑，以及使用油污回收機和其他設備。同時，岸灘清理隊伍在屬非憲報公布泳灘的南丫島大灣肚進行清理岸灘油污的演練。在處理模擬有害有毒物質泄漏事故時，應變小組將損毀的貨櫃吊離海面，以堵截污染源頭。

聯合演習由海事處及環境保護署負責統籌。參與政府部門及機構包括消防處、政府飛行服務隊、香港警務處、政府化驗所、民眾安全服務隊，以及多間油公司和一間由它們合組的污染控制公司。

演習不單為應變隊伍提供實踐機會，亦有助各相關單位因應泄漏物質的性質及規模而採取有效防止污染的應急策略。"
Oilex and HNS exercises test marine pollution responses (with photos),2025-10-15 14:55,2025-10-15 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500206.htm," The annual marine pollution joint response exercises, codenamed ""Oilex 2025"" and ""Maritime Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) 2025"", were conducted by various government departments this morning (October 15) at the waters off Ha Mei Wan of Lamma Island to test their marine pollution responses in the event of a spillage of oil and HNS in Hong Kong waters.

 In the test scenario, an oil tanker collided with a container vessel, leading to fuel oil spilling from the oil tanker and five containers loaded with Sodium Hydroxide falling overboard. Subsequently, an oil spill response team arrived at the scene and cleaned up the spilled oil on the sea surface. The Fire Services Department (FSD) and other response groups were also tasked at the scene to contain and handle the probable spilled Sodium Hydroxide as necessary to prevent threats to the nearby environment and facilities.

 In the exercises, various participating parties carried out a series of simulated response actions. After the simulated oil spill, the oil tanker anchored at the waters off Ha Mei Wan of Lamma Island,while a salvage team transferred the fuel oil from the damaged tank and patched the leak to stop further oil spillage at the source. Moreover, an oil pollution combat team deployed floating barrier booms to encircle the oil tanker and set up barrier booms in the vicinity to prevent the spill from spreading. The exercise also simulated the spraying of oil dispersant with water from pollution control vessels and a Government Flying Service (GFS) helicopter onto oil on the sea surface, as well as the use of oil skimmers and other equipment. Simultaneously, a shoreline cleaning team conducted a shoreline oil clean-up drill at Tai Wan To, a non-gazetted beach, on Lamma Island. In combating the simulated HNS spill, the response groups lifted the damaged containers out from the sea to stop the pollution at the source.

 The joint response exercises were co-ordinated by the Marine Department and the Environmental Protection Department. The participating government departments and organisations included the FSD, the GFS, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Government Laboratory and the Civil Aid Service, as well as several oil companies and a pollution control company jointly formed by them.

 The response exercises not only provided hands-on experience for response members but also helped relevant parties to adopt an effective emergency response strategy for preventing pollution according to the properties and extents of spilled substances."
立法會：政務司司長提交回應政府帳目委員會第八十四號報告書政府覆文致辭,2025-10-15 14:50,2025-10-15 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500539.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上提交政府帳目委員會（帳委會）第八十四號報告書政府覆文的致辭全文：

主席：

我今天向立法會提交政府覆文，回應政府帳目委員會今年七月二十三日向立法會提交的第八十四號報告書。

我歡迎帳委會的報告書，並且感謝帳委會主席邵家輝議員及各位委員付出的投入和貢獻。政府接納帳委會的各項建議，並在覆文中詳細交代相關政策局及部門的具體回應。帳委會就審計署署長第84號報告書內關於「屋宇署對強制驗窗計劃的管理」及「街道潔淨服務」兩個章節進行了公開聆訊。我在此重點說明兩個部門跟進帳委會建議措施和取得的進展。

屋宇署對強制驗窗計劃的管理

就強制驗窗計劃，屋宇署按「風險為本」的原則優化了揀選目標樓宇的機制，包括向過去一年曾經發生墮窗事故、而先前發出的驗窗通知已超過五年的樓宇，重新發出驗窗通知。屋宇署亦完成分析445宗墮窗事故的成因，歸納出多項風險因素；而跟進措施則包括把有較高墮窗風險的樓宇納入揀選準則，並透過加大教育和宣傳力度，特別在雨季、颱風季節及農曆歲晚，提高業主正確使用與保養窗戶及抹窗安全的意識。

就跟進驗窗通知的遵辦情況，屋宇署已加強內部督導和監察，透過由首長級人員領導的三層架構，定期檢視進度和適時將複雜個案上報至高層處理。另外，為加強監管並確保負責驗窗合資格人士的工作符合部門要求，屋宇署將抽查署方人員審核個案的目標增加兩成至每年600 宗。

屋宇署會繼續善用科技和精簡程序提升工作效率。屋宇署電腦系統於本年年底完成更新後，將自動化編製向未遵辦業主發出警告信，亦會適時提示署方人員按時完成工作。屋宇署亦會探討研發人工智能系統，從而更有效率地處理合資格人士就強制驗窗計劃呈交的相關表格。

最後，政府會於二○二六年上半年向立法會提交修訂《建築物條例》的條例草案，修訂建議將包括提升驗窗通知遵辦率的措施，例如提高不遵辦驗窗通知的定額罰款及最高罰則；以及對未有遵辦驗窗通知而導致傷亡或財物損毀的個案引入新罪行等，進一步加強阻嚇力。

街道潔淨服務

食物環境衞生署（食環署）致力為市民提供清潔衞生的生活環境。為實現這目標，署方在過去數年推出多項措施，以優化和加強街道潔淨服務的監察工作，並提升執法效率及推展宣傳教育。

在服務監察方面，食環署已更新工作指引和流程，並持續監察署方執勤人員及承辦商遵從情況，以加強對街道潔淨服務承辦商的表現監督。此外，食環署亦着手優化電子管理系統，讓承辦商及署方執勤人員以電子方式提交、更新及審批工作計劃和報告，進一步提升署方監察街道潔淨服務的效率。

為加強執法成效，食環署自二○一七年成立專責執法小隊，打擊違反潔淨法例的行為。自二○二三年十月起，亂拋垃圾及非法擺放廢物的定額罰款已大幅提高。對比罰款提高前後的12個月，食環署就這兩類行為發出的定額罰款通知書大幅減少三成，反映整體執法成效提高。為進一步提升專責執法小隊運作效率，食環署已更新小隊的工作紀錄及相關工作指引，亦會全面檢討隊伍數目、分布及編制等範疇。

此外，食環署會繼續檢視安裝網絡攝錄機地點以打擊非法棄置垃圾的情況，並計劃於一年內將安裝點由現時的500 多個大幅增加至逾1 500個，以進一步擴大監察範圍並提升執法效率。

食環署亦積極應用科技，提升街道潔淨服務的質素及效率。署方目前已廣泛應用配備高速清洗盤的小型洗街車，並正測試不同新設備，包括自動化清掃機械人、電動輔助手推車及以工業級機械狗搬運重物等。這些設備除提升工作效率外，亦有助減輕前線員工體力消耗及降低工傷風險。署方將積極推動這方面的工作。

此外，食環署不時檢討外判服務的安排，確保可以按運作需要、服務性質及效益等，採取最合適的方式提供服務。署方亦正檢視現行承辦商失責扣費金額及相關招標評分機制，並會積極考慮作出調整，以鼓勵承辦商提供優質服務。同時，食環署正檢討服務承辦商履行合約條款，特別是有關僱傭規定的核查機制。署方亦會檢視現行指引，以及探討增加與非技術員工會面次數的可行性，以確保承辦商遵循合約條款和保障員工權益。

主席，我再次感謝帳委會的努力和建議。相關政策局及部門會嚴格按照覆文所述的回應，全力落實各項改善措施。

多謝主席。"
LC: Speech by CS in presenting Government Minute in response to Report No. 84 of Public Accounts Committee,2025-10-15 14:50,2025-10-15 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500542.htm,"Following is the speech (translated from Chinese) by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, in presenting the Government Minute in response to Report No. 84 of the Public Accounts Committee in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

President,

Laid on the table today is the Government Minute (GM) responding to Report No. 84 of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) presented to the Legislative Council (LegCo) on July 23, 2025.

I welcome the Report of the PAC and am grateful for the devotions and contributions by the Chairman of the PAC, the Hon Shiu Ka-fai, and members of the PAC. The Government accepts PAC's various recommendations and sets out in detail in the GM the specific responses of the relevant bureau and departments (B/Ds). The PAC conducted public hearings on the chapters on Management of Mandatory Window Inspection Scheme (MWIS) by the Buildings Department (BD) and Street cleansing services of the Director of Audit's Report No. 84. I would like to highlight the key measures taken and progress made by the two departments in response to the recommendations.
 
Management of MWIS by the BD

With regard to MWIS, the BD has enhanced the mechanism for selecting target buildings based on risk-based principles, which includes re-issuance of MWIS notices to buildings involved in fallen window incidents in the preceding year with previous MWIS notices served for more than five years. The BD has also completed the analysis on the causes of the 445 fallen window incidents and identified multiple risk factors leading to such incidents. The follow-up measures include incorporating buildings identified as having a higher risk of falling windows into the criteria for selecting target buildings, strengthening the efforts in education and publicity, particularly during rainy and typhoon seasons as well as prior to the Lunar New Year so as to enhance owners’ safety awareness of the proper use, maintenance and cleaning of windows.

Regarding the follow-up actions on the compliance status of MWIS notices, the BD has strengthened internal supervision and monitoring by regularly reviewing the progress and promptly escalating complex cases to higher levels for handling through a three-tier structure led by directorate officers. Moreover, to ensure that the work of qualified persons (QPs) responsible for window inspection meets its requirements, the BD will raise the target number of sample checking and audit checks to be conducted by the BD staff by 20 per cent to 600 cases each year, thereby enhancing monitoring efforts.

The BD will continue to enhance work efficiency by leveraging technology and streamlining procedures. Upon completion of the system revamp by the end of this year, the BD's computer system will automatically generate warning letters to non-compliant owners and provide prompt notifications to BD staff to complete work in a timely manner. The BD will also explore the development of an artificial intelligence system with a view to processing relevant forms submitted by QPs under MWIS more efficiently.

Finally, the Government will introduce an amendment bill to the Buildings Ordinance into the LegCo in the first half of 2026. The proposed amendments will include measures to boost the compliance rate of MWIS notices, such as increasing the fixed penalty and maximum penalty levels for non-compliance with MWIS notices, and introducing a new offence of non-compliance with MWIS notices which ended up with personal injury or property damage with a view to further enhancing deterrence. 

Street cleansing services

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is committed to providing a clean and hygienic living environment for the public. To achieve this goal, the Department has introduced various measures over the past few years to enhance and strengthen the monitoring of street cleansing services, enhance enforcement efficiency, as well as promote public education.

On monitoring of the services, the FEHD has updated guidelines and workflows, and has been continuously monitoring the compliance and execution by duty officers and contractors in order to step up monitoring of the contractor's performance in street cleansing. In addition, the FEHD is working to upgrade the electronic management systems to enable electronic submission, update and approval of work programmes and reports by duty officers of the contractors and the Department, so as to further enhance the Department's efficiency in monitoring the street cleansing services.

The FEHD has set up Dedicated Enforcement Teams (DETs) since 2017 to combat litter offences so as to strengthen the effectiveness of enforcement. Since October 2023, the fixed penalty for littering and unlawful depositing of waste have been raised substantially. Comparing the 12 months before and after the raise in penalty, the number of fixed penalty notices issued by the FEHD for these two types of offences has drastically reduced by 30 per cent, reflecting an improvement in enforcement effectiveness as a whole. To further boost the operational efficiency of the DETs, the FEHD has updated the work records of the teams and relevant operational guidelines. A comprehensive review will also be conducted on the number, distribution and establishment of the teams.

In addition, the FEHD will continue to review the situation of illegal deposit of refuse at locations with Internet Protocol cameras installed and plans to increase the installation points from 500-odd at present to more than 1 500 within one year, in order to further expand the monitoring areas and enhance enforcement efficiency.

The FEHD has also been actively applying technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of street cleansing services. Currently, the Department has widely used the mini-street washing vehicles equipped with pressure washer surface cleaners, and is testing various new equipment, including automated sweeping robots, electrically assisted trolleys and industrial grade robot dogs for transporting heavy items. Apart from enhancing work efficiency, such equipment can also help ease the physical burden on frontline staff and lower the risk of workplace injuries. The Department will proactively promote the work on this front.

In addition, the FEHD reviews from time to time the arrangements for outsourcing services to ensure the adoption of the most suitable mode of service delivery having regard to the operational needs, service nature and effectiveness. The Department is also reviewing the existing payment amount to be deducted in case of contractors' default and the related tender scoring system. Adjustments will be actively considered to encourage contractors to provide quality service. Meanwhile, the FEHD is reviewing the verification mechanism for contractor's compliance with contract terms, especially employment-related provisions. The Department will review existing guidelines and explore the feasibility of increasing the number of meetings with non-skilled staff so as to ensure compliance with the contract terms by contractors and protection of staff rights.

President, I would like to thank the PAC again for its efforts and suggestions. The B/Ds concerned will strictly adhere to their responses and implement various improvement measures as set out in the GM with full efforts. 

Thank you, President."
LCQ4: Clearing obstructions which pose hazards to road safety,2025-10-15 14:38,2025-10-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500430.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  Two incidents occurred respectively last month, including a case in which a bus driver was injured while driving by a metal rod propelled into the air from the road surface after being run over by vehicles, and another where a bus was struck by road debris on its windscreen. These incidents have aroused grave public concern about the risks posed by obstructions on road surface to road users. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1)whether it will take measures to step up clearance of obstructions on highways, such as by increasing inspection frequency, installing additional closed-circuit televisions along the roads, improving clearance procedures, etc, so as to effectively ensure the safety of all road users; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2)whether the Government will review the existing legislation to impose additional fines and other heavier penalties on behaviours concerning depositing or leaving objects on carriageways which may pose hazards to road safety, with a view to enhancing the deterrent effect; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3)whether it will review the existing mechanism for members of the public to report road obstructions, establish more convenient channels for reporting potential road safety hazards, such as by setting up dedicated hotlines and online platforms, etc, and step up road safety publicity and education efforts to encourage members of the public to proactively report potential road safety hazards and remove them under safe circumstances, thereby jointly preventing the recurrence of related accidents; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Government has consistently placed great importance on road safety and the requirement for moving vehicles to properly contain or secure their loads. Having consulted the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Highways Department (HyD) and the Transport Department (TD), my response to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Li is as follows:

(1)The HyD engages contractors to carry out daily proactive inspections and cleaning of expressways under its purview using specialised road sweepers. Should any obstacles, including construction materials etc, be found scattered on the road surface, contractors will immediately dispatch personnel and equipment to expedite the clearance. In addition to regularly reviewing contractors' work records, the HyD also conducts on-site spot checks to evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning efforts. Upon receiving public complaints or reports, the HyD will also promptly arrange for contractors to conduct immediate cleaning to minimise the risks posed by road obstacles to road users.

  The HyD has established a performance pledge for clearing obstacles on expressways, targeting to arrive at the scene within 1.5 hours of receiving a referral and immediately arrange for clearance work. All cases over the past three years have met this target.

  Additionally, the HyD actively applies innovative technologies in the maintenance of carriageways. For example, inspection vehicles equipped with laser scanning devices and global satellite positioning technology are deployed to swiftly identify potholes and other potential defects on road surfaces. This enables a comprehensive understanding of road conditions and allows for the precise prioritisation of repair works, thereby enhancing safety and maintenance efficiency.

(2)Under the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations (Cap. 374G), the driver shall ensure that any load is properly secured to or contained inside the vehicle and that its weight and manner in which it is placed in the vehicle shall not cause danger to any person. The HKPF is responsible for law enforcement against related contraventions. Any driver who contravenes the relevant regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for three months on first conviction; and to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months on subsequent convictions. Moreover, the TD also takes enforcement actions against vehicles failing to properly secure their loads in the area of government tunnels and control areas pursuant to the relevant regulations. Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for six months.

  Over the past three years, all departments have consistently strengthened enforcement efforts. Prosecution figures have declined which indicates that enforcement and penalties are effective. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and review the law as appropriate. Moreover, the HKPF continuously monitors data on serious and fatal traffic accidents and conducts territory-wide enforcement operations in response, particularly targeting non-compliance by lorries. These include the ""Crackdown on Lorry Offences"" operation conducted in September this year, with the aim of enhancing overall road safety.

  Relevant departments are proactively exploring the use of new technologies to enhance the enforcement efficiency and strengthen road safety. Recently, the HKPF conducted the first trial of drone-assisted traffic enforcement on non-urban road sections to combat dangerous driving. The HKPF will review the effectiveness of the trial and consider the feasibility of extending the initiative to other areas or offence types, including insecure vehicle loads and overloading.

(3)Currently, the operators of government tunnels and control areas provide hotlines for members of the public to report incidents. The TD has been closely monitoring the performance of the operators and the operation of their hotlines regularly.

  Regarding the incident that members of the public were unable to contact the operator of Tai Lam Tunnel via the hotline from September 15 to the morning of September 16, 2025, the operator has submitted a report to the TD. The report indicates that at the time of the incident, the call transfer mechanism of the telephone conversation recording device malfunctioned, preventing external calls from being transferred to tunnel staff for answering. Following emergency repairs, the system resumed normal on September 16. Due to the operator's failure to promptly respond to the hotline, the TD has instructed them to strengthen their preparedness and contingency measures for tunnel emergencies to ensure the smooth operation of the systems.

  We consider the operator's failure to maintain effective 24-hour hotline operations unacceptable. The TD has issued a Notice of Default to the operator in accordance with the contract to pursue its liability, and the operator has provided compensation as contractually required. The Department will continue to follow up on this matter seriously and enhance monitoring of the hotline operations.

  Members of the public may report road conditions to government departments through multiple channels at present. To enhance incident management, the TD plans to introduce AI-based closed-circuit television systems for detecting road obstructions and incidents when replacing the traffic control and surveillance systems in tunnels and controlled areas.

  The TD has been conducting publicity and educational activities through various channels to enhance the goods vehicle trade's awareness of safe loading. For example, a Code of Practice for the Loading of Vehicles is compiled in accordance with the law, which provides guidelines on safe loading. The TD also issues the Goods Vehicle Trade Newsletter and holds regular meetings with the goods vehicle trade. Reminder messages are affixed on traffic signal controllers and displayed on variable message signs in tunnel areas. The TD and the HKPF will continue to work with the Road Safety Council to conduct publicity and educational programmes, such as publishing and distributing the Road Safety Bulletin, and disseminating information through social media platforms, to enhance road users' awareness of safety.

  Thank you, President."
​立法會四題：清除危害道路安全的障礙物,2025-10-15 14:38,2025-10-15 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500429.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上李世榮議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

上月先後發生巴士司機在駕駛期間被路面輾起的鐵通插傷，以及巴士擋風玻璃遭路面彈起碎石擊中的事故，引起公眾高度關注路面障礙物對道路使用者造成的風險。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否採取措施加強清除公路上的障礙物，例如增加巡查次數、在路面增設閉路電視及完善清理流程等，以切實保障所有道路使用者的安全；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）政府會否檢討現行法例，就在行車道路丟棄或遺下可能危害道路安全物件的行為，提高罰款及其他罰則以加強阻嚇力；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）會否檢討現時市民通報路面障礙物的機制，以及設立更便捷的路面安全隱患通報渠道，例如專屬熱線及線上平台等，並加強道路安全宣傳教育，鼓勵市民主動通報，以及在安全情況下清除路面隱患，共同防範相關意外重演；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府非常關注道路安全，包括車輛在行車時須適當盛載或固定負載物的要求。就李世榮議員的提問，經諮詢香港警務處（警務處）、路政署及運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）路政署委聘承辦商每日主動巡查及清掃轄下的快速道路，採用專設的道路清掃車，若發現障礙物包括建築物料等散落路面，承辦商會即時調派人手和設備加快清理。署方除定期審視承辦商的工作紀錄外，亦會實地抽查清掃效果。當接獲公眾投訴或報告後，路政署亦會迅速安排承辦商作即時清理，以減低路面障礙物對道路使用者造成的風險。

路政署為清理快速道路上的障礙物訂立服務承諾，以接獲轉介後1.5小時內到達現場為目標，並即時安排清理工作。過去三年，全部個案均達標。

此外，路政署在道路維護中亦積極應用創新科技，例如利用配備激光掃描設備及全球衞星定位技術的檢測車迅速識別路面坑洞及其他潛在缺陷，以全面掌握路面狀況及準確制定維修次序，提升安全及維修效率。

（二）根據《道路交通（交通管制）規例》（第374G章），司機須確保負載物適當地固定或盛載在車輛上，不可對任何人士造成危險。警務處負責就此執法，初犯者最高可處罰款五千元及監禁三個月。如多次被定罪，則最高可處罰款一萬元及監禁六個月。此外，運輸署亦根據政府隧道及管制區的規例於相關範圍內就未有穩妥固定負載物的車輛執法，違者最高可處罰款五千元及監禁六個月。

最近三年，各部門持續加強執法，而檢控數字有所下降，顯示執法和罰則有效。我們會繼續密切留意情況，適時檢視法例。此外，警務處亦持續監察嚴重及致命交通意外的數據，展開全港性專題執法行動，包括特別留意貨車的違規情況，例如剛於今年九月進行「打擊貨車違例行為」行動，以提升整體道路安全水平。

相關部門亦積極探索應用新科技，提升執法效率和道路安全。最近，警務處首次在非市區路段試驗使用無人機作交通錄影執法，打擊危險駕駛行為。警務處將會檢討成效，考慮擴展至其他地區或違例項目的可行性，例如負載物不穩固及超載等。

（三）現時政府隧道及管制區設有熱線電話，讓市民向營辦商報告事故。運輸署一直密切監察營辦商的表現，並定時監察熱線的運作情況。

就早前有市民表示於本年九月十五日至十六日上午未能成功以熱線聯絡大欖隧道營辦商一事，營辦商已向運輸署提交報告，指事發時電話對話錄音裝置的轉駁機制失靈，導致外部來電無法轉駁至隧道人員接聽。經緊急維修，系統已於九月十六日回復正常。由於營辦商未能及時接聽熱線，署方已責成營辦商必須加強隧道緊急事故的準備及應變，確保系統運作暢順。

我們認為營辦商未能有效營運24小時熱線的情況絕不理想，運輸署已按合約向營辦商發出失責通知書追究責任，營辦商已按合約要求作出賠償。署方會繼續嚴肅跟進事件，並加強監察熱線的運作情況。

現時市民可透過多個途徑向政府部門反映道路狀況。此外，運輸署計劃在更換隧道及管制區的交通管制及監察系統時，引入人工智能閉路電視偵測路面障礙物和路面事故，優化事故管理。

運輸署一直透過不同渠道進行宣傳和教育，提高貨車業界對載貨安全的意識。例如，根據法例制訂《車輛載貨守則》，就載貨安全提供指引；出版《貨車運輸通訊》和與貨車業界舉行定期會議；在交通燈控制器和隧道區內可變信息顯示屏發放提示信息。運輸署及警務處會繼續聯同道路安全議會進行宣傳教育，包括出版和派發《道路安全通訊》及透過社交媒體平台發放資訊等，加強道路使用者的安全意識。

多謝主席。"
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-15 14:36,2025-10-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500535.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 15) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

LC: Speech by CS in presenting Government Minute in response to Annual Report of The Ombudsman 2024/25,2025-10-15 14:35,2025-10-15 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500521.htm,"Following is the speech (translated from Chinese) by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, in presenting the Government Minute in response to the Annual Report of The Ombudsman 2024/25 in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Mr President,

On July 2 this year, I submitted the Annual Report of The Ombudsman 2024/25 to the Legislative Council. Today, I submit the Government Minute (GM) to comprehensively respond to the recommendations as set out in the Annual Report.

The Government attaches importance to the practical, constructive, and actionable recommendations made by the Office of The Ombudsman (the Office) concerning the provision of public services, with a view to further promoting an efficient and citizen-oriented public administration. In the year 2024-25, the Office concluded 40 complaint cases by full investigations and completed eight direct investigations, making a total of 254 recommendations - a record high number in recent years. All relevant government bureaux, departments and public bodies have seriously examined the Office's reports and accepted all recommendations, reflecting the current-term Government's commitment to enhancing the management and efficacy of public services. Departments concerned have either implemented or are actively pursuing the follow-up actions to the Office's recommendations. Detailed responses are set out in the GM.

In addition, in recent years the Office has actively used mediation to handle complaints which do not involve or only involve minor maladministration, with a view to resolving issues in a non-adversarial manner and achieving win-win for all parties concerned. All relevant government bureaux, departments and public bodies have also fully supported and cooperated with the Office's mediation efforts. In 2024-25, the Office handled 555 cases through mediation - a threefold increase as compared with the previous year, and mediations were typically completed within just one day or a few days. The Government will continue to collaborate with the Office to promote mediation, aiming to expedite the assistance rendered to the public in resolving complaints.

To recognise government bureaux, departments and public officers' outstanding performance in complaint handling and public service delivery, the Office held The Ombudsman's Awards Presentation Ceremony in October 2024, presenting awards to six departments and organisations and 79 public officers.

We understand the community's rising expectations on public service delivery. In May this year, I met with The Ombudsman to discuss on strengthening the systems on departmental management and performance accountability. In this year's Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced the establishment of the Heads of Department Accountability System with a view to continuously strengthening departmental performance through institutionalised and systematic management, thereby fostering a culture of continuous improvement and boost public confidence.

Mr President, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to The Ombudsman and his professional team for their independent, objective and fair work in their investigations and mediation efforts, which provided support for the effective governance of the Government. A robust monitoring mechanism is the cornerstone of social progress; the work of the Office and government administration are complementary to each other. The Government will, as always, fully support the work of the Office and continue to provide efficient, quality and people-oriented public services to the citizens.

Thank you, Mr President."

Civil servants receive vaccines against influenza (with photos),2025-10-15 14:18,2025-10-15 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500330.htm,"  With a view to facilitating and encouraging civil servants in receiving influenza vaccinations, the Civil Service Bureau and the Department of Health continue to implement the Civil Service Eligible Persons (CSEPs) Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Pilot Scheme this year. For the first time, outreach vaccination services are being conducted at specified government offices on a pilot basis. About 110 CSEPs received influenza vaccines at the outreach station at the Central Government Offices (CGO) this morning (October 15).

  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, and the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, spoke with civil servants receiving the influenza vaccines to listen to their views. The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, also received their vaccines at the outreach station.

  Mrs Yeung said, ""It is better to receive the influenza vaccine sooner rather than later. As civil servants frequently interact with the public, being vaccinated can better protect their health and the health of the members of the public they serve, reduce the risk of workplace and community transmission of influenza, and minimise the impact on the delivery of public services due to illnesses in the civil service. I encourage more civil service colleagues to receive their vaccinations early, and I am pleased with the good response from colleagues today. The outreach vaccination service is efficient and convenient, allowing colleagues to complete their vaccinations with only a brief absence from work.""

  The CSEPs Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Pilot Scheme in 2025/26 has commenced and is open to all CSEPs aged 6 months or above. Those who have made an appointment can receive free seasonal influenza vaccines at families clinics. For details, please visit www.csb.gov.hk/english/admin/benefits/66.html.

  In addition, this year's pilot scheme provides vaccination services by appointment through the outreach stations, on a pilot basis, at specified government offices (the CGO, the Queensway Government Offices, the West Kowloon Government Offices, and the North Point Government Offices) on several dates between mid-October and November."

立法會五題：防止濫用人才入境計劃,2025-10-15 13:56,2025-10-15 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500266.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上李浩然議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

據報有部分人士透過人才入境計劃來港產子後便離開，其目的只為了讓子女取得香港永久性居民身份，而非真正有意來港發展。有意見指出，有關做法不但有違人才政策原意，更為本港各項社會服務的資源規劃帶來不確定性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）在現行人才政策下，有否機制防止「以來港發展為名，產子為實」的情況；

（二）為避免大量雙非兒童（即父母均非香港永久性居民但在香港出生）的情況重現，政府有否考慮設立機制，要求來港人才及其受養人在本港公私營醫療機構預約分娩時，須簽署聲明文件確認其留港發展意向，或要求其提交證明文件（例如在港的工作證明或出入境紀錄），以確定其已達到一定的留港日數要求；及

（三）有否評估人才入境計劃對香港長遠人口規模及結構的影響，以精準調控社會福利、住屋、醫療、教育等公共服務的資源分配？

答覆：

主席：

作為國際人才樞紐，香港一直歡迎外來人才來港發展，藉以豐富本地人才庫。為應對人口高齡化及人力短缺的挑戰，本屆政府自二○二二年底推出了一系列「搶人才」措施，包括推行以高薪和高學歷人士為目標的高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃），以及優化多項現有計劃，至今已吸引超過24萬不同界別的全球精英來港發展。其中，高才通計劃反應踴躍，超過九萬人已經來港，而首批簽證到期的高才有逾半成功續簽，大多投身關鍵產業，收入可觀，展現強大市場競爭力。香港在國際管理發展學院最近發布的《2025年世界人才排名》中躍升至歷來最高的第四位，成為亞洲之冠，足見人才政策路向正確且已見成效。

然而，成功吸引人才來港之後，如何「留人才」才是最大挑戰。政府除會繼續大力發展經濟及新興產業，提供有利環境讓本地及海外人才發展外，亦致力為人才提供所需支援，鼓勵他們落地生根，為香港發展作出貢獻。

就議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局（醫衞局）、房屋局、教育局、入境事務處（入境處）和政府統計處（統計處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）正如我剛才提及，在全球人才競奪戰中，如何「留人才」是我們面對的挑戰。

經不同入境計劃來港的人才大部分都很年輕，七成在40歲以下，其中高才通計劃C類人才更幾乎全數在30歲或以下，他們正值事業打拼期，亦處於組建家庭的黃金年齡。政府的跟進調查顯示，來港人才考慮移居時其中一項非常重視的就是家庭因素，包括子女教育安排等。這反映「留人才」除發展機遇外，亦須兼顧人才家庭的整體需要，提供更全面的配套，加強人才及其家庭對香港的歸屬感。

外來人才是推動經濟發展的重要力量之一，以高才通計劃為例，估計可為香港帶來每年約340億元的直接經濟貢獻，相當於本地生產總值約1.2%。我們希望視這些人才為香港的一分子，因而須照顧他們跟其他香港市民一樣的家庭需要，以促進他們在港安居樂業。

現行受養人政策已容許人才攜同配偶及未成年子女來港生活，我們亦歡迎人才在港成家生育，扎根香港。這些新力軍現在及日後都是本地勞動力的重要來源，有助改善人口結構，緩解本地人口老化和生育率偏低的結構問題，為香港的可持續發展提供長期的人力支撐。

我必須強調，各項不同定位的人才入境計劃均設有清晰的申請資格與審批程序。現時法例下，任何人向入境處作出虛假申述或申報失實資料，一經定罪最高可被判罰款15萬及監禁14年。入境處設有嚴謹有效的機制，就人才入境計劃的每宗申請進行嚴格審批，以確保只有符合獲批資格及相關入境政策的人士才獲准在港居留。申請獲批的都是香港希望吸納、具競爭力的人才。據我們觀察，仍未獲聘的人才都有興趣在港長遠發展，並未發現有人所謂「以來港發展為名，產子為實」的情況。

政府明白社會期望有限的公共資源用得其所。現時來港人才只佔香港整體人口很低比例，並無對本地資源構成壓力。醫衞局現時並無計劃因應市民獲得香港居民身分的途徑而就預約分娩服務實施不同的限制或要求。不過，勞工及福利局（勞褔局）會持續留意來港人才的落戶情況，包括蒐集有關人才在港生育的數據，以便相關政策局作出更完善的資源規劃。如發現有濫用人才入境計劃的情況，政府會採取適當措施。

（三）統計處和勞褔局會分別定期編製最新人口和人力推算，以掌握推算期內香港人口和人力需求的變化趨勢，從而為政府在不同政策及資源分配上的規劃提供基礎。現時兩項推算均會考慮主要人才入境計劃的影響。下輪人口普查將於二○二六年進行，而勞褔局亦正開展人力推算的中期更新工作，預計在二○二六年第四季公布結果。

各政策局會因應人口變化及人力資源最新趨勢，持續檢視所負責措施的執行情況及成效，例如：房屋局會密切留意各類房屋的供求情況，並按需要適時調整相應政策；醫衞局會繼續深化醫療體系改革，確保香港醫療體系行穩致遠；教育局會不時檢視教育政策，切合社會需要。"
LCQ5: Preventing abuse of talent admission schemes,2025-10-15 13:56,2025-10-15 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500292.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 It is reported that some individuals come to Hong Kong under the talent admission schemes but leave after giving birth to their children, with the sole purpose of obtaining the Hong Kong permanent resident status for their children, rather than a true intention to pursue their career in Hong Kong. There are views pointing out that such practice not only goes against the original intent of the talent policy, but also creates uncertainty to resource planning of various social services in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether there is any mechanism under the current talent policy to prevent situations where individuals come to Hong Kong under the guise of career development but actually just to give birth;

(2) to avoid the recurrence of a large number of doubly non-permanent resident children (i.e. children born in Hong Kong but whose parents are non-permanent residents of Hong Kong), whether the Government has considered establishing a mechanism requiring talent coming to Hong Kong and their dependants to sign a declaration confirming their intention to remain in Hong Kong for career development when making delivery bookings at public or private medical institutions in Hong Kong, or requiring them to submit supporting documents (such as proof of employment in Hong Kong or immigration records) to confirm that they have met the requirement of staying in Hong Kong for a certain number of days; and

(3) whether it has assessed the impact of the talent admission schemes on Hong Kong's long-term population scale and structure, with a view to precisely controlling the allocation of resources for public services such as social welfare, housing, healthcare and education?

Reply:

President,

 As an international talent hub, Hong Kong has been welcoming outside talent to come to the city for development, thereby enriching the local talent pool. To address the challenges posed by an ageing population and manpower shortage, the current-term Government has since end-2022 implemented a series of measures to trawl for talent. These include the launch of the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) targeting talent with high income and academic qualifications, as well as enhancement of the various existing schemes. To date, more than 240000 global elites from diverse backgrounds have been attracted to come to Hong Kong for development. Among others, the TTPS has received enthusiastic responses, with over 90000 talents having arrived in Hong Kong. Among the first batch of TTPS entrants whose visas have expired, more than half successfully secured extension of stay. Most of them have joined key industries and earn competitive salaries, demonstrating strong market competitiveness. In the World Talent Ranking 2025 published recently by the International Institute for Management Development, Hong Kong's ranking leapt markedly to fourth globally, marking the highest-ever ranking topping Asia. This is clear evidence that the talent attraction policies are in the right direction with effective outcomes.

 Nevertheless, after the talents have been successfully attracted to come to Hong Kong, the greater challenge lies in retaining them. In addition to continuing the efforts in boosting the economy and the growth of emerging industries to provide a favourable environment for the development of local and overseas talent, the Government is committed to providing the necessary support for talent, encouraging them to settle down and contribute to Hong Kong's development.

 In consultation with the Health Bureau (HHB), Housing Bureau (HB), Education Bureau (EDB), Immigration Department (ImmD) and Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), my reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) As mentioned earlier, in the global competition for talent, our real challenge lies in how to retain them.

 The majority of talents admitted to Hong Kong under the various admission schemes are very young, with 70 per cent under the age of 40. In particular, nearly all admitted under Category C of the TTPS are aged 30 or below. They are at critical stages in their careers and also within the prime age range for starting families. The Government's follow-up surveys have revealed that family considerations, such as arrangements for children's education, are among the top priorities for incoming talent when making a relocation decision. This reflects that talent retention is not only driven by career opportunities but also has to take into account the overall needs of their families. More comprehensive support should be offered to strengthen the sense of belonging of talent and their families to Hong Kong.

 Outside talents is a vital driving force for our economic development. Taking the TTPS as an example, the entrants are estimated to contribute directly to Hong Kong's economy by an amount of some HK$34 billion per annum, which is equivalent to about 1.2 per cent of the local Gross Domestic Product. We hope to regard these talents as part of our community, and therefore must address their family needs just as we do for other Hong Kong residents, so as to help them live and work in contentment in the city.

 The current dependant policy allows talent to bring their spouses and minor children to reside in Hong Kong. We also welcome them to start families and give birth to children in Hong Kong so as to establish roots in the city. These new additions to our population are and will continue to be an important source of the local labour force, which would help improve the demographic structure and alleviate the challenges posed by the local ageing population and the low birth rate, providing long-term manpower support for Hong Kong's sustainable development.

 I must emphasise that the various talent admission schemes with different positionings all have clear eligibility criteria and vetting procedures. Under current laws, anyone who furnishes false information or makes false representation to the ImmD are liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years. The ImmD has a rigorous and effective mechanism in place for assessing each application under the talent admission schemes in a rigorous manner. This is to ensure that only applicants meeting the relevant eligibility criteria and immigration policies will be admitted into Hong Kong for stay. The approved applicants are all talents with competitiveness that Hong Kong aims to attract. Based on our observations, talent who have not yet secured employment are genuinely interested in pursuing long-term development in Hong Kong. We are not aware of anyone coming to Hong Kong under the guise of career development just to give birth.

 The Government understands the public expectation about proper use of limited public resources. At present, the incoming talent represents only a small fraction of Hong Kong's overall population, and have not put pressure on local resources. The HHB has no plan at the moment to impose different restrictions or requirements on maternity service bookings based on the route through which individuals obtain their Hong Kong residency. However, the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) will continue to keep in view the settlement of incoming talents in Hong Kong, including collecting data on talent's childbirth, to facilitate better resource planning by relevant policy bureaux. If any abuse of the talent admission schemes is detected, the Government will take appropriate action.

(3) To provide the basis for the Government's planning in various policy areas and resource allocation, the C&SD and the LWB regularly compile updated population and manpower projection respectively to understand the trend of change in Hong Kong's population and manpower needs during the projection period. Currently, these two sets of projections have taken into account the impact of the major talent admission schemes. The next population census is scheduled to be conducted in 2026, and the LWB is now conducting a mid-term update on the manpower projection, with the results expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2026.

 The various policy bureaux will continuously review the implementation and effectiveness of the measures under their respective purviews in response to the latest demographic and manpower trends. For instance, the HB will continue to closely monitor the supply and demand of different types of housing and adjust the corresponding policies in a timely manner where necessary. The HHB will continue to deepen the reform of the healthcare system to ensure the viability of Hong Kong's healthcare system. The EDB will review education policies from time to time, with a view to meeting the needs of the society."

主席：

北部都會區（北都）是引領香港未來發展、推動產業轉型的重要引擎，也是香港與大灣區其他城市聯動發展的新平台，提升香港作為連接內地與國際的關鍵樞紐地位。由於北都幅員廣闊，投資龐大，香港特別行政區政府會採用創新及多元的發展模式，善用政府和市場資源推展計劃。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢創新科技及工業局後，我回覆如下：

（一）在「片區開發」模式下，投得項目的發展商會綜合開發較大規模的地塊，當中包括具商業價值的住宅和產業用地，以及公共設施用地。政府已提出三個「片區」試點，分別位於洪水橋／厦村新發展區（洪水橋）、粉嶺北新發展區和新田科技城。早前完成的市場意向徵集共收到22份意向書，有助我們敲定招標條款前了解市場看法。

我們計劃先為洪水橋「片區」於今年年底進行招標，而另外兩個「片區」則計劃於明年陸續推出。我們正因應市場意見，調整洪水橋「片區」的相關安排和要求，包括將私營房屋住宅用地由兩幅增至三幅，以及取消要求投標者興建一條主要道路以減少建設公共設施的要求，增加項目的盈利能力。「片區」內有三幅企業及科技園用地，原本我們只要求成功投得片區的企業發展和營運其中一幅，其餘兩幅只需完成土地平整後交還政府。我們正考慮在標書提供選項，讓願意參與建設片區內更多產業用地的投標者，在「雙信封制」的招標模式下為此額外承擔而獲得分數。另外，我們正考慮提供較長的建築規約，以及較有彈性的地價繳付安排，包括分期支付。我們年底招標時會公布最終安排。

（二）我們將靈活批撥北都內的土地，推動企業落戶和投資。如果是採用招標方式，可因應情況考慮是否單純看投標者出價，或採用「雙信封制」方式進行招標。最近創新科技及工業局推出的沙嶺數據園區用地，便採用了「雙信封制」招標模式，洪水橋「片區」亦傾向採用這種模式招標。採用「雙信封制」招標，將綜合考慮非價格和價格建議，並按個別情況制訂評審的比重和元素。以沙嶺的招標作為例子，非價格建議和價格建議的比重分別為百分之七十和百分之三十，非價格建議會評審投標者在投資和發展產業方面為香港帶來的貢獻，例如聘用人數、投資規模和啓用時間。為確保招標工作公開透明，評審準則會詳列於招標文件，讓投標者清楚理解項目要求和評分準則。政府會成立由相關政策局和部門組成的標書評審委員會，根據《物料供應及採購規例》客觀專業地評審標書。評審結果會提交予財經事務及庫務局轄下的中央投標委員會作審批。

（三）河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區）第一期首三座大樓已落成。港深創新及科技園有限公司（港深創科園公司）正積極推進相關的招租工作，現時已經與近30家分別來自內地、香港及國際的企業、大學及研究機構就進駐河套香港園區深入磋商，其中相當部分已簽署租約，預計首批涵蓋生命健康科技、微電子、新能源及人工智能等支柱產業的租戶將於今年年底前正式投入營運。港深創科園公司的招租工作正持續進行中，簽署租約的企業和機構將會陸續有所增加。

港深創科園公司會提供相應的配套設施，例如人才公寓、商業及其他附屬設施，支援進駐企業及機構的營運。同時，公司正積極籌備在二○二五至二六年度內展開「河套港深創新及科技園培育計劃」，為初創團隊和企業提供資助和支援服務，發揮「以產聚才」的作用。此外，政府正探討透過籌備中的北都專屬法例為管理指定地區提供跨境流動的便捷方法，包括人流、數據流和物資流等，財政司司長亦領導政策局制訂優惠政策包，涵蓋批地、地價、資助或稅務減免優惠等，這些策略措施均有助吸引科研及高端製造業落戶香港包括河套香港園區。"
LCQ17: Implementation of national education and national security education in schools,2025-10-15 12:50,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500167.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Jimmy Ng and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  The 2024 Policy Address sets out a series of task indicators for patriotic education. These include the launch of the ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country 3.0"" series of interâschool national education activities, the provision of training places within three years for about 1 000 junior secondary Chinese History teachers who are not major in History, and the provision of at least 1 000 training places within two years in learning circles for senior secondary Chinese History teachers. Furthermore, this year's Policy Address states that the Government will promote patriotic education facilities in the Mainland, making them the patriotic education bases of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and that the Education Bureau (EDB) will also design itineraries for students to experience the founding history of our country. The latest status of the Government's implementation of national education and national security education in schools has drawn significant public attention. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest status of the implementation of various patriotic education measures, and among them, the number of measures that have meet their targets; whether higher targets will be set for those that have already met their targets; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) given that national education covers a broad range of areas, and that relevant learning elements are embedded across multiple academic subjects, whether the authorities will include more academic subjects when setting new indicators for patriotic education in the future; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that the EDB has administered multiple rounds of the Basic Law and National Security Law Test for teachers, of the respective pass rates for these test rounds;

(4) of the number of schools applied for the Enhanced ""My Pledge to Act"" funding programme in the past three years, so that these schools are provided with additional resources to strengthen the implementation of national education and national security education in schools; the proportion of successful applications under the programme and the average amount of funding granted per approved application;

(5) as it is reported that the EDB has recently updated the national security curriculum framework for primary and secondary schools to highlight the concept of ""comprehensive security"", and will organise briefing sessions and teacher training courses to provide support for schools in implementing national security education, of the respective details of those briefing sessions and training courses, including the estimated number of sessions to be held and the number of teachers expected to receive training;

(6) of the details regarding the promotion of patriotic education facilities in the Mainland, including the estimated number of such facilities that will become the patriotic education bases of the HKSAR, and the names of these facilities; and

(7) of the estimated time and manpower required by the EDB to design itineraries for students to experience the founding history of our country; the expected timeline to make these itineraries available for schools to register for participation?

Reply:

President,

  National education has been one of the goals of the school curriculum and an indispensable part of school education. National education has already incorporated elements and spirit of patriotic education. Key contents which dovetail with the Patriotic Education Law of People's Republic of China, including Chinese history, national affairs, Chinese culture, national geography, Constitution and Basic Law education, national symbols and signs (such as the national flag, national anthem and national emblem), and national security, have been embedded in various Key Learning Areas (KLAs) and relevant subjects at the primary and secondary levels as well as the curriculum of kindergartens, and are closely intertwined with values education and life-wide learning activities to provide essential learning experiences for students.

  The Education Bureau (EDB) continues to adopt a multi-pronged and co-ordinated approach to integrate patriotic education into school education, such as optimising the curriculum, developing learning and teaching resources, offering training to teachers, organising diversified life-wide learning activities (covering out-of-classroom practical activities, Mainland study tours, etc.), and providing resources and grants for schools, with a view to providing comprehensive, all-round, interdisciplinary and cross-key stage support for schools to integrate patriotic education into daily learning and teaching, as well as helping students deepen their understanding of our country, develop a sense of national identity and enhance their national awareness and national spirit.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Jimmy Ng is as follows:

(1) and (2) The 2024 Policy Address puts forward a series of indicators on promoting patriotic education on and off campus. The target has been met for seven of the initiatives in the 2024/25 school year. The remaining initiative, scheduled for implementation over a period of three school years from 2024/25 to 2026/27, has also made satisfactory progress in the 2024/25 school year. Details are as follows:


Interâschool national education activities: The ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country 3.0"" series of interâschool national education activities were successfully held with an attendance exceeding 50 000, far higher than expected.
National geography: The EDB has completed the trial teaching scheme and developed the National Geography Resource Portal, and will continue to develop learning and teaching resources on national geography for reference and use by schools.
Focus inspections on national education: Focus inspections on national education were conducted in at least 50 schools to enhance the quality and effectiveness of national education.
Mainland exchange programmes and study tours: Starting from the 2024/25 school year, at least 30 routes with ""red resources"" have been provided for participation by students.
Activities for kindergarten parents: Starting from the 2024/25 school year, all kindergartens joining the Kindergarten Education Scheme (KES) are required to organise one or more activities relating to national education for parents each year.
Training for senior secondary Chinese History teachers: Provided more than 1 000 training places in the 2024/25 school year and will continue to provide such training in the new school year.
Implementation of the Primary Humanities curriculum: The EDB completed the review of the textbooks for Primary One and Primary Four, provided over 9 900 training places, and continued to provide learning and teaching resources. The subject of Primary Humanities has been implemented starting from the 2025/26 school year.
The remaining indicator for implementation over a period of three school years has been launched and taken forward as scheduled. The EDB has planned to provide training places for about 1 000 junior secondary Chinese History teachers who are not History majors within three years starting from the 2024/25 school year. In the 2024/25 school year, some 400 teachers attended the training sessions. Training places will continue to be offered in the new school year to support teachers in completing systematic training.


  Building on the outcomes achieved last year, the 2025 Policy Address further sets the following indicators (including new indicators):


Regularise and popularise the ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country"" series of activities starting from the 2025/26 school year and strive to foster patriotic education in schools through collaboration across school sponsoring bodies and among schools to further enhance students' national identity and cultural confidence, with a target annual attendance of no less than 30 000.
Continue to conduct focus inspections on national education in at least 50 schools in the 2025/26 school year to enhance the quality and effectiveness of national education.
Provide no less than 40 itineraries for students to experience the founding history of our country through Mainland exchange programmes and study tours starting from the 2025/26 school year.
Organise various activities on national education for participation by students in the 2025/26 school year, with an expected attendance of no less than 200 000.
Continue to provide training places for junior secondary Chinese History teachers who are not History majors in the 2025/26 school year (over a period of three years).
Provide 1 500 teacher training places and continue to provide learning and teaching resources for the optimised senior secondary Chinese History and History curricula in the 2026/27 school year.


(3) Starting from the 2023/24 school year, all newly-appointed teachers in public sector schools, Direct Subsidy Scheme schools and kindergartens joining the KES (including newly-joined teachers and teachers changing schools) are required to pass the Basic Law and National Security Law Test (BLNST) in order to be considered for appointment. From the 2022/23 to 2024/25 school years, the EDB conducted a total of 16 rounds of BLNST for degree holders and non-degree holders involving about 72 600 applicants in total, including serving teachers, those aspiring to join the teaching profession and prospective graduates. A total of about 55 570 candidates sat for the BLNST, and the passing rate was over 90 per cent.

(4) To support schools in promoting national education, national security education, as well as media and information literacy education, the Quality Education Fund (QEF) launched the enhanced ""My Pledge to Act"" funding programme in mid-November 2021. According to the school-based needs, publicly-funded primary and secondary schools (including special schools) may submit an application to the QEF for funding not exceeding $300,000; kindergartens joining the KES may submit an application for funding not exceeding $150,000. Since the launch of the programme, about 880 schools have submitted their applications with funding approved. Generally speaking, as the additional resources required for implementing the relevant projects vary among schools, and the amount of funding to be granted is determined based on the content of individual applications, the average amount of funding granted cannot fully reflect the actual situation of the programme with respect to its implementation.

(5) The EDB released respectively in May and July 2025 the updated Curriculum Framework of National Security Education in Hong Kong (the Curriculum Framework) and the curriculum frameworks of National Security Education for 27 subjects covering eight KLAs and the Citizenship and Social Development subject, so as to keep national security education abreast of the times, provide teachers with clearer and more comprehensive guidelines, and help schools further promote national security education upon the existing solid foundation.

  After the release of the above frameworks, the EDB has held eight briefing sessions within four months to brief stakeholders, including representatives of school sponsoring bodies, school supervisors, principals and teachers, on the main updates and highlights of the Curriculum Framework and elucidate how the elements of national security education can be incorporated into various KLAs. The EDB will also provide no less than 1 000 teacher training places relating to national security education in the 2025/26 school year. The training programmes will comprise, among others, face-to-face and online courses, study tours, experience sharing sessions and learning circles to enhance teachers' professional competence for the effective implementation of national security education.

(6) This year marks the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance and the World Anti-Fascist War. With the support of the Central Government, the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, located next to the Marco Polo Bridge in Beijing, has been established as the first Patriotic Education Base for Hong Kong and Macao Youth on August 21 this year.

  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will continue to promote patriotic education facilities in the Mainland by making them patriotic education bases of the HKSAR, and encourage visits by more students and youths to help them comprehensively understand the history and culture as well as the development and achievements of our country.

(7) In the 2025/26 school year, a number of tours with itineraries designed to help students experience the founding history of our country have been launched starting from October 2025. Schools will be invited to participate in due course. For example, under the ""'Passing on the Torch' Platform Programme Series: An Exploration into the History, Humanities and Ethnic Culture in Guizhou"", students will visit the Guizhou Long March Culture Digital Art Museum, where they will learn about key historical events of the Long March, experience the hardships faced by the Red Army, and gain a deeper understanding of the Long March spirit. The manpower resources required for the relevant Mainland exchange programmes are subsumed under the recurrent expenditure of the EDB."
立法會十七題：在學校推動國民及國家安全教育,2025-10-15 12:50,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500179.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上吳永嘉議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆︰

問題：

二○二四年《施政報告》為愛國主義教育訂下一系列項目指標，當中包括推展「心繫家國3.0」聯校國民教育活動、三年內為約1 000位非主修歷史的初中中國歷史科教師提供培訓名額，以及在兩年內提供不少於1 000個高中中國歷史科教師學習圈培訓名額等。此外，今年《施政報告》表示政府會推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施，將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地，而教育局亦會設計建國歷史體驗行程等。政府在學校推動國民及國家安全教育的最新情況備受社會關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）各項愛國主義教育措施的最新推行情況為何，當中有多少項措施已經達標；會否為已達標的措施訂立更高的目標；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於國民教育涵蓋的範疇廣闊，相關學習元素蘊含於多個學術科目，當局未來訂立愛國主義教育的新指標時，會否涵蓋更多學科；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於教育局為教師舉辦了多輪《基本法及香港國安法》測試，相關測試的合格率分別為何；

（四）過去三年，每年有多少間學校申請「我的行動承諾」加強版撥款計劃，讓該等學校有更多資源加強於校內推展國民及國家安全教育；成功申請該計劃的比例，以及每個獲批申請平均取得的撥款金額分別為何；

（五）據報教育局近日更新中小學國家安全教育課程框架，以突出「大安全」概念，並將舉辦簡介會及教師培訓課程支援學校落實國家安全教育，相關簡介會和培訓課程的詳情（包括預計舉辦的簡介會場數，以及可為多少名教師提供培訓）分別為何；

（六）有關推廣內地愛國主義教育設施的詳情為何，包括預計被納入特區愛國主義教育基地的設施數目，以及該等設施的名稱為何；及

（七）教育局就設計建國歷史體驗行程的工作預計所需的時間及人手為何；預計何時可讓學校報名參與該等建國歷史體驗行程？

答覆：

主席：

國民教育一直是學校課程的宗旨之一，是學校教育不可或缺的部分。國民教育已經融入愛國主義教育的元素和精神。國史、國情、中華文化、國家地理、《憲法》和《基本法》教育、國旗、國歌、國徽等國家象徵和標誌、國家安全等與《中華人民共和國愛國主義教育法》相對接的重要內容，已納入香港中小學各學習領域和相關科目，以及幼稚園課程中，並與價值觀教育及全方位學習活動等互相緊扣，構成學生的重要學習經歷。

教育局持續透過「多重進路 、互相配合」的方式把愛國主義教育融入學校教育，包括優化課程、發展學與教資源、提供教師培訓、舉辦多元化的全方位學習活動（如課外實踐活動、內地考察），以及為學校提供資源和津貼等，以期能全覆蓋、全方位、跨學科及跨學段地支援學校將愛國主義教育融入日常學與教之中，加深學生對國家的認識，建立國家觀念，增強民族意識與愛國情懷。

就吳永嘉議員的提問，教育局回覆如下：

（一）及（二）二○二四年《施政報告》提出一系列在校園內外推展愛國主義教育的指標，其中七項措施已於二○二四／二五學年達標，餘下一項橫跨二○二四／二五至二○二六／二七三個學年，該項措施在二○二四／二五學年的推行情況亦符合理想。詳情如下：

聯校國民教育活動：「心繫家國3.0」聯校國民教育活動順利完成，參加人數遠超預期，超過50 000人次。
國家地理：完成試教計劃及製作國家地理資源庫，並持續發展國家地理的學與教資源，供學校參考及使用。
國民教育重點視學：在不少於50所學校進行國民教育重點視學，提升國民教育的質素和成效。
內地交流及考察活動：由二○二四／二五學年起，提供不少於30個「紅色資源」行程，供學生參與。
幼稚園家長活動：由二○二四／二五學年起，所有參加幼稚園教育計劃的幼稚園，須每年為家長舉辦一項或以上與國民教育相關的活動。
高中中國歷史科教師培訓：已於二○二四／二五學年提供超過1 000個培訓名額，並於新學年持續提供相關培訓。
小學人文科課程推展：已完成小一及小四年級課本評審工作，並提供超過9 900個培訓名額和持續提供學與教資源。小學人文科已於二○二五／二六學年開始推行。
餘下一項橫跨三個學年的指標已按既定進度開展和推進。由二○二四／二五學年起，計劃三年內為約1 000位非主修歷史的初中中國歷史科教師提供培訓名額；其中二○二四／二五學年，已有約400位教師參與培訓。新學年將會繼續提供培訓名額，支援教師完成系統培訓。


建基去年取得的成果，二○二五年《施政報告》進一步訂立以下指標（包括新增項目）：


由二○二五／二六學年起，「心繫家國」系列活動將恆常化和普及化，全力在學界以跨辦學團體和跨校形式推動愛國主義教育，進一步加強學生的國民身分認同和文化自信，並設定每學年不少於30 000人次的參與目標。
在二○二五／二六學年，繼續在不少於50所學校進行國民教育重點視學，提升國民教育的質素和成效。
由二○二五／二六學年起，學生內地交流及考察活動提供不少於40個建國歷史體驗行程。
在二○二五／二六學年，舉辦各項與國民教育相關的學生活動，預計不少於20萬學生人次參加。
在二○二五／二六學年（橫跨三年），繼續為非主修歷史的初中中國歷史科教師提供培訓名額。
在二○二六／二七學年，就優化高中中國歷史科和歷史科課程，提供1 500個教師培訓名額和持續提供學與教資源。


（三）由二○二三／二四學年起，所有公營學校、直接資助計劃學校及參加幼稚園教育計劃的幼稚園的新聘教師（包括新入職教師及轉校教師）均必須在《基本法及香港國安法》測試取得及格成績，方可獲考慮聘用。教育局於二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五學年共舉辦了16輪《基本法及香港國安法》測試，分別供學位程度和非學位程度人士參加，報名人數共約72 600人次，當中包括在職教師、擬入職教育行業的人士及準畢業生，共約55 570人次應考，測試的及格率逾九成。

（四）優質教育基金（基金）於二○二一年十一月中旬推出「我的行動承諾」加強版撥款計劃，旨在支援學校推廣國民教育、國家安全教育，以及媒體與資訊素養教育。按校本需要，公帑資助的中、小學（包括特殊學校）可向基金申請一項不超過30萬元的撥款計劃；已參加幼稚園教育計劃的幼稚園則可申請一項不超過15萬元的撥款。自計劃推出以來，約880所學校遞交計劃申請，並獲批撥款。一般而言，個別學校在推行項目時所需的額外資源存在差異，撥款金額乃根據個別申請內容而定，故平均撥款金額並未能充分反映計劃的實際情況。

（五）教育局已於二○二五年五月及七月公布更新版《香港國家安全教育課程框架》（《課程框架》）和27個科目的國家安全教育課程框架，涵蓋八個學習領域和公民與社會發展科，讓國家安全教育與時並進，為教師提供更清晰和全面的指引，幫助學校在已有的良好基礎上，進一步推動國家安全教育。

教育局於《課程框架》發布後四個月內，於八場簡介會向辦學團體代表、校監、校長及教師等持份者介紹《課程框架》的主要更新內容與重點，並說明各學習領域如何結合國家安全教育元素。教育局亦將於二○二五／二六學年提供不少於1 000個國家安全教育教師培訓名額，培訓課程包括實體及網上課程、考察、經驗分享會，以及學習圈等，提升教師的專業能力，以有效落實國家安全教育。

（六）今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，在中央政府的支持下，坐落北京盧溝橋側的中國人民抗日戰爭紀念館已在今年八月二十一日正式設立為首個港澳青少年愛國主義教育基地 。

香港特別行政區（特區）政府會繼續推廣內地的愛國主義教育設施，並將其納入特區愛國主義教育基地，鼓勵更多香港學生和青年到訪，讓他們全面認識國家的歷史與發展成就。

（七）教育局於二○二五／二六學年設計的建國歷史體驗行程由二○二五年十月起陸續出發，並適時讓學校報名參與，如「『薪火相傳』平台系列：貴州歷史人文與民族生活探索之旅」，學生將到訪貴州長征文化數位藝術館，學習長征重要歷史事件，感受紅軍長征的艱難險阻和領悟長征精神。有關活動所需的人力資源已納入教育局的經常開支內。"
立法會二十題：青年宿舍計劃的推行情況,2025-10-15 12:47,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500338.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上鄭泳舜議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆︰

問題：

政府推出青年宿舍計劃已逾13年，由政府全資興建的七個青年宿舍項目中，目前只有兩個投入服務。此外，政府在二○二三年擴大該計劃，資助非政府機構租用合適酒店和旅館轉作青年宿舍（資助計劃），至今已有六個項目獲批。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）五個由政府全資興建但尚未投入服務的青年宿舍項目的最新進度為何，以及該等項目有否出現延誤；如有，原因為何；鑑於政府就2025-2026財政年度開支預算回覆本會議員問題時表示，青山公路及灣仔救世軍街的兩個項目分別處於施工前工程及技術可行性研究階段，政府是否仍會繼續該兩項興建計劃；

（二）資助計劃下的六個青年宿舍項目的最新入住率及租戶數目分別為何；

（三）鑑於於資助計劃規定，青年宿舍項目的青年租戶須每年參加不少於200個小時的社區或志願服務以回饋社區，青年租戶就上述要求的達標率為何（按項目列出）；據悉有青年人擔心未能達到社區服務的時數要求而未有申請入住青年宿舍，政府有否評估有關要求在鼓勵青年回饋社區上的成效；及

（四）據報位於通州街的首個由私人住宅物業轉作青年宿舍項目的部分宿位租金達7,600元至7,800元，而據悉雖然有關租金水平高於政策所訂（即租金水平應在同區附近相似單位市場租金的60%以內），但外界對該項目宿舍的質素反應正面，政府日後會否再接納以私人物業轉作青年宿舍用途的項目申請，又或是否已收到其他同類申請；有否評估，日後該類項目的租金會否有下調空間？

答覆：

主席：

青年宿舍計劃是一項重要的青年發展措施，除了回應青年對擁有自住空間的期望外，我們亦希望租戶在住宿期間透過參與青年宿舍提供不同的支援及訓練而有所得益。民政及青年事務局（民青局）一直以多管齊下的方式，積極落實青年宿舍計劃，其中包括全數資助非政府機構在未盡其用的土地上興建青年宿舍，以及推出青年宿舍計劃－將酒店和旅館轉作青年宿舍用途的資助計劃（資助計劃）等。現時計劃下推出的青年宿舍有八間，合共提供超過3 700個宿位。

就鄭泳舜議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下：

（一）現時由政府全資興建的青年宿舍項目共七個。首兩個由香港青年協會及保良局營運的青年宿舍已分別於二○二○年及二○二三年落成啓用，合共提供超過1 700個宿位。三間分別由香港女童軍總會、香港青少年發展聯會和東華三院正在興建的青年宿舍將於二○二六年起陸續落成，合共提供約1 000個宿位。至於香港聖公會福利協會有限公司及救世軍兩個項目亦正分別進行施工前工程及技術可行性研究。

（二）資助計劃自二○二三年推出至今已批出六個項目並已投入營運，合共提供約2 000個宿位。截至二○二五年八月底，除一般的租戶流轉外，六間已運作一年或以上的青年宿舍（包括由政府全資興建的青年宿舍及資助計劃的項目），房間入住率平均約八成半。

（三）青年宿舍計劃是一個推動青年增值和發展的平台，讓他們可以發揮所長、回饋社會。我們希望青年租戶在住宿期間，可以靈活參與青年宿舍的活動與訓練和地區或志願服務，從而自我增值，擴闊社交網絡，以及更有效規劃個人發展的目標。同樣地，青年宿舍所在社區亦會得益於青年租戶提供的地區服務，令弱勢社羣得到青年人的直接幫助，建立更廣闊的朋輩網絡，長遠有助構建和諧社會。現時青年宿舍整體運作暢順，而營運青年宿舍的非政府機構亦有安排租戶參與青年宿舍的活動（例如創業培訓、身心發展、職場文化等）和地區外展或志願服務。由於推出的青年宿舍的位置、規模及設施各有不同，營運的非政府機構會就其個別實際情況，訂定日常管理安排及營運方式，包括舉辦活動的種類、次數及形式等。民青局會持續監察青年宿舍的運作，因應其實際情況檢討資助計劃的運作安排，並會按需要調整執行細節。

（四）青年宿舍的租金會根據其地點、房間大小、生活配套，以及非政府機構提供的活動及服務等而釐定，租戶可按個人需要及經濟能力作選擇。民青局會繼續以多管齊下的方式，積極推展青年宿舍計劃。我們亦會和理念一致的相關持份者合作，研究以不同方法增加青年宿舍供應，讓更多青年受惠。"

Question:

It has been over 13 years since the Government launched the Youth Hostel Scheme. Of the seven youth hostel projects whose construction is fully funded by the Government, only two have been put into service. Furthermore, the Government expanded the Scheme in 2023 by subsidising non-governmental organisations in renting suitable hotels and guesthouses for use as youth hostels (the Subsidy Scheme), with six projects approved to date. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest progress of the five youth hostel projects whose construction is fully funded by the Government but not yet put into service, and whether there have been any delays in these projects; if so, of the reasons for that; given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 2025-2026, the Government indicated that the two projects at Castle Peak Road and Salvation Army Street, Wan Chai were respectively at the ""pre-construction works"" and ""technical feasibility studies"" stages, whether the Government will continue with these two construction projects;

(2) of the latest room occupancy rate and number of tenants of the six youth hostel projects under the Subsidy Scheme respectively;

(3) given that it is stipulated under the Subsidy Scheme that youth tenants of youth hostel projects shall participate in no less than 200 hours of community or volunteer services each year to give back to the community, of the attainment rates of youth tenants in terms of the above requirement (set out by project); as it is learnt that some young people have refrained from applying for youth hostels due to concerns about failing to meet the community service hour requirement, whether the Government has assessed the effectiveness of this requirement in encouraging young people to give back to the community; and

(4) as it has been reported that the rent of some hostel places in the first youth hostel project converted from private residential housing located at Tung Chau Street ranges between $7,600 and $7,800, and it is learnt that that although the rental levels are higher than those stipulated under the policy (i.e. rental levels being within 60 per cent of the market rent for similar flats in nearby areas of the same district), the response from the community to the quality of hostel in this project has been positive, whether the Government will accept further applications for converting private properties into youth hostels in the future, or whether it has already received other similar applications; whether it has assessed if there is room for reducing the rent of such projects in the future?

Reply:

President,

The Youth Hostel Scheme (YHS) is an important youth development initiative. Apart from meeting young people's aspirations of having their own living space, we also hope that youth tenants will benefit through participating in the various support and training activities provided by youth hostels during their stay. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) has been proactively implementing the YHS through a multi-pronged approach, which includes fully funding non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to construct youth hostels on under-utilised sites, and launching the YHS - Subsidy Scheme for Using Hotels and Guesthouses as Youth Hostels (the Subsidy Scheme). There are currently eight youth hostels launched under the YHS, providing over 3 700 hostel places in total.

In response to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Vincent Cheng, our reply is as follows:

(1) There are currently seven youth hostel projects whose construction is fully funded by the Government. The first two youth hostels run by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups and the Po Leung Kuk have commenced operation upon completion of construction in 2020 and 2023 respectively, offering a total of over 1 700 hostel places. Three youth hostel projects under construction by the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association, the Hong Kong Association of Youth Development and the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals are expected to be gradually completed from 2026 onward, offering a total of about 1 000 hostel places. The Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Welfare Council Limited's project and the Salvation Army's project are undergoing the pre-construction works and technical feasibility studies respectively.

(2) Since the launch of the Subsidy Scheme in 2023, six projects have been approved and put into use, providing about 2 000 hostel places in total. As at end-August 2025, except for the usual tenant turnover slots, the average room occupancy rate of the six youth hostels (including youth hostels whose construction is fully funded by the Government and projects under the Subsidy Scheme) that have operated for at least a year is about 85 per cent.

(3) The YHS offers a platform to promote youth enrichment and development, enabling them to unleash their strengths and contribute to society. We hope that, through flexible participation in activities/training at youth hostels and community/voluntary services during stay, youth tenants may achieve self-enrichment, expand their social networks and effectively set personal development goals. Meanwhile, the communities where the youth hostels are located will also benefit from the community services provided by youth tenants. This in turn helps the underprivileged obtain direct support from young people and establish a wider peer network, which is conducive to building a harmonious society in the long run. At present, the overall operation of the youth hostels has been smooth. The NGOs operating the youth hostels have also arranged youth tenants to participate in activities at the youth hotels (such as entrepreneurship training, physical and mental development, and workplace culture) and community outreach or volunteer services. As the location, scale and facilities of each youth hostels differ, taking into account their actual circumstances, the NGO operators will make day-to-day management and operational arrangements accordingly, including the type, number and mode of activities to be organised. The HYAB will continue to monitor the operation of the youth hostels, review the implementation arrangements of the Subsidy Scheme according to actual circumstances, and adjust the execution details when necessary.

(4) The rent charged by a youth hostel is determined by its location, room size, ancillary facilities as well as the activities and services to be provided by the NGOs. Youth tenants may, according to their own needs and financial means, choose among different youth hostels. The HYAB will continue to take forward the YHS proactively through a multi-pronged approach. In order to benefit more young people, we will also continue to collaborate with relevant stakeholders sharing our vision to explore different ways to increase the supply of youth hostels."
立法會十九題：提升九龍公園設施,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500316.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上江玉歡議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆︰

有意見認為，九龍公園作為本港市區大型公園之一，擁有豐富歷史遺產，而且地理位置優越。然而，隨着時代變遷，園內部分設施日漸老化及使用率偏低，整體發展潛力尚未得到充分發揮。關於提升九龍公園設施，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年九龍公園各項主要設施（例如游泳池、體育館、兒童遊樂場、歷奇樂園等）的使用人次及使用率，以及滿意度調查結果為何，並按設施類別列出分項資料；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，與九龍公園同屬市區大型休憩空間的維多利亞公園，因經常舉辦多元化大型活動而成為市民及遊客的熱門去處，過去三年該兩個公園相類設施（例如游泳池、體育館／運動場地、兒童遊樂場等）的使用情況的比較為何；有否具體分析該兩個公園設施的使用率出現差異的主要原因；

（三）當局有何恆常機制及具體措施，以定期檢查、維修及更新九龍公園的設施，以確保該等設施符合公眾需求並維持良好狀態；有否制訂優化方案增加九龍公園對本地市民及遊客的吸引力（例如改善園內空間的規劃及設計、增辦多元化活動等），從而提升園內設施的使用率；

（四）當局會否考慮以公私合營的模式為九龍公園進行翻新工程，讓私營機構參與特定園區的設計、營運及維修保養工作，以減輕政府的財政負擔並加速更新設施；及

（五）鑑於政府於去年公布改建九龍公園內前威菲路軍營58座為中華文化體驗館，以及在鄰近的尖沙咀天文台總部興建副樓以提供包括公眾教育資源中心及展覽廊等設施，政府如何將上述項目與九龍公園的現有設施及活動進行整合，以打造統一的休憩、文化及旅遊體驗空間；會否就上述的項目及整合工作設立跨部門協作機制，以發揮協同效應，從而提升區內遊客流量及市民參與度？

答覆：

主席：

康樂及文化事務署（康文署）致力在轄下公園提供多元化的康體和休閒設施，以滿足市民在消閒和康樂活動方面的需要，推廣健康生活模式和普及體育運動。九龍公園是康文署轄下市區大型公園之一，佔地13公頃，提供全面的動態和靜態康樂設施，一直深受市民歡迎。

就江玉歡議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年，九龍公園主要設施的使用率或訪客人次載列如下：




平均使用率
二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年


體育館
			（主場館）
98.3%

鳥湖
266 000
346 000
366 000




康文署沒有備存兒童遊樂場和歷奇樂園使用人次的相關資料。

根據二○二五年七月至八月進行的問卷調查，絕大部分（85%）受訪者對九龍公園整體滿意程度為「非常滿意」或「滿意」。

（二）維多利亞公園與九龍公園均設有動態和靜態設施，為受歡迎的大型公園，兩者相類似的設施為游泳池和兒童遊樂場。

康文署沒有備存有關兒童遊樂場使用人次的資料。就游泳池而言，過去三年，九龍公園和維多利亞公園游泳池的使用人次載列如下：




到訪人次
二○二二年
二○二三年
二○二四年


九龍公園游泳池
521 000
661 000
657 000


維多利亞公園游泳池
469 000
554 000
540 000




市民會因應其居住地點、工作地點和作息時間等選擇鄰近的游泳池游泳，因此各個游泳池的到訪人數受一系列的因素影響。另外，維多利亞公園與九龍公園內的部份設施亦可供團體租用以舉辦不同規模及類型的活動，既為訪客提供多元化的遊園體驗，亦為不同機構提供優質的活動場地。過去三年，不同團體租用九龍公園以舉辦嘉年華、展覽及比賽等活動超過110次（例如香港國際手球錦標賽、香港室內賽艇錦標賽暨慈善長途接力賽、「國慶75周年紅旗飄揚齊歡呼」活動、全民太極日、香港漫畫星光大道第四期開幕禮等）；而維多利亞公園同期則有超過40次租用，當中包括多項大型活動（例如農曆年宵市場、香港花卉展覽、中秋綵燈會、渣打香港馬拉松及工展會）。

（三）及（四）為持續提升公共服務水平，康文署一直參考訪客和工務部門的意見，為九龍公園制訂各項設施的恆常維修及大型改善計劃，以不斷提升公園的訪客體驗，確保設施的安全性和舒適性，並為訪客提供一個更具吸引力的休閒空間。

在二○二四至二五年度的改善計劃中，康文署除為九龍公園進行恆常的維修及保養工作外，已完成中國花園和兒童遊樂場的翻新工程、以及健身設施和香港漫畫星光大道的優化工程，讓訪客可以享受更好的遊園體驗。另外，康文署在剛完成的水景花園噴水池翻新工程中，增設特別設計造型的熊貓擺設，亦同時優化戶外的洗手間，引入以功夫為主題的設計元素，增添視覺吸引力。至於二○二五至二六年度的改善計劃則會包括歷奇樂園的洗手間翻新工程、百鳥苑及花圃的美化工程等，以進一步提升公園的整體環境，為訪客提供更舒適的休憩空間和更豐富的自然景觀。

康文署會不時檢視公園設施的使用情況，在資源和場地條件許可的情況下，按需要適時制訂和推行合適的設施優化工程，以繼續為九龍公園增添特色，增加吸引力。

此外，在公私合營的管理方面，康文署會視乎公私合營模式的商業可行性和機會，並持開放態度，引入創新思維，積極考慮是否採用公私合營的建議，以提升設施的服務質量，務求為市民帶來更優質的康樂設施和更豐富的訪客體驗。

（五）康文署將改建九龍公園內前威菲路軍營58座及加建新翼，成為一所旨在弘揚中華文化的中華文化體驗館。體驗館將設有多用途的戶外空間，同時糅合九龍公園的自然環境，既可用作舉辦與中華文化相關的活動，亦為市民和旅客提供一處集文化元素與自然景觀於一身的中華文化體驗空間。體驗館亦會善用科技提供多元化的互動體驗和實物學習活動，以吸引市民和旅客參與。"
立法會二題：「BUD專項基金」,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500374.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上陳祖恒議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的答覆：

問題：

二○二五年《施政報告》宣布向「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）注資14.3億元，並擴大資助地域範圍。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有業界人士反映，「BUD專項基金」下的簡易申請計劃（「申請易」）極受業界歡迎，政府會否考慮將「申請易」的項目資助上限由10萬元調高至30萬元；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）政府會否考慮將「BUD專項基金」的適用範圍進一步擴大至所有境外市場，以與明年整合至該基金的「中小企業市場推廣基金」的適用範圍看齊，從而更好地支援業界開拓內銷、傳統及新興市場；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於政府經營帳目有望於下一財政年度錄得盈餘，政府會否考慮將「BUD專項基金」的資助配對比率，調整為政府與企業以一對一比率分擔總核准開支，以協助業界升級轉型；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）是政府支援中小企業的其中一項措施，目的是支持本地企業升級轉型及拓展多元化市場。由二○一二年成立至二○二五年九月，「BUD專項基金」共批出近12000宗申請，涉及總資助額約75億元，惠及約7800家企業。政府自二○一八年起多次優化「BUD專項基金」，包括注資共77億元、擴闊資助地域範圍、分階段提高每家企業的累計資助上限由50萬元至700萬元，以及推出「申請易」和「電商易」等。

就陳祖恒議員的提問的三個部分，現回覆如下：

（一）「申請易」於二○二三年六月推出，旨在加快審批涉及特定措施而資助金額為10萬元或以下的申請，其申請表格、所須遞交的證明文件要求及審批安排均已簡化，而申請處理時間亦較「BUD專項基金」一般申請的服務承諾大幅減少一半至30個工作天內完成。

截至二○二五年九月底，「申請易」共批出760宗申請，平均資助額約為7.2萬元。我們相信維持現時每宗10萬元的資助上限已可滿足大部分企業的需要。此外，我們亦需確保公帑用得其所，故釐定「申請易」每宗申請款額的上限時，需小心平衡資助款額和潛在財政風險。我們認為目前的安排是合適的。

另外，為了讓企業更迅速地獲得資助，以應對多變的經濟環境，我們自二○二五年三月起已優化「申請易」的安排，讓每間企業由之前每六個月只可遞交一項申請，放寬至每三個月可遞交一項；同時亦增加了建立網上銷售平台為可獲資助的項目措施。

（二）「BUD專項基金」現時的資助地域範圍涵蓋40個已與香港簽署自由貿易協定（自貿協定）及／或促進和保護投資協定（投資協定）的經濟體，佔二○二四年香港對外商品貿易總值約80%。行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》宣布進一步擴大「BUD專項基金」的資助地域範圍，覆蓋多八個包括「一帶一路」國家在內的經濟體，亦即把基金適用的地域範圍增加20%，以協助中小企業拓展更多元化的市場。同時，鑑於「中小企業市場推廣基金」將於二○二六年七月整合至「BUD專項基金」，我們會加強宣傳和協助企業透過「BUD專項基金」——「申請易」參與展覽會和出口推廣活動。

香港正與多個經濟體探討簽訂投資協定，其中與卡塔爾的投資協定談判已大致完成，雙方將在各自完成所需內部程序後簽署協定。隨着香港日後簽署更多自貿協定或投資協定，「BUD專項基金」資助適用的地域範圍將進一步擴闊。我們亦已自二○二五年三月起擴大「電商易」的資助地域範圍至東南亞國家聯盟10個國家。

（三）多年來，「BUD專項基金」一直積極支援中小企業，期間亦推出了多輪優化措施。同時，企業對政府資助的需求近年大幅攀升，「BUD專項基金」二○二四年的申請宗數較二○一九年增加超過320%，而基金近九成的資助是於最近六年（二○一九年至二○二四年）批出。

為確保「BUD專項基金」的財政可持續性，政府於二○二五年三月推出措施，當中包括調整基金的資助比例至1（政府）：3（企業），希望企業能更慎重選擇適當及具成本效益的項目，並更願意投放資源。有關措施剛於二○二五年三月推出，我們需時檢視成效，故未有計劃調整基金的資助比例。

支援中小企業是政府其中一項重要政策，因此政府於今明兩個財政年度會向「BUD專項基金」注資共超過30億元，惟我們需確保資助計劃的財政可持續性，令更多企業能獲得支援及讓受惠面保持廣泛，故政府會以適時和聚焦的方式審慎運用公帑，以應對複雜多變的經濟環境。

除優化「申請易」和「電商易」外，我們亦已更針對性資助企業推行綠色轉型項目和列明成立新業務單位的有關專業服務費用為可獲資助項目，協助企業重整供應鏈，以應對貿易戰帶來的挑戰。

我們會繼續與業界密切溝通，不時檢視基金的運作情況，為中小企業作出合適支援，同時顧及基金負擔能力及其財政可持續性。"
LCQ2: BUD Fund,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500372.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Sunny Tan and a reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 The 2025 Policy Address announced an injection of $1.43 billion into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) and an expansion of its geographical scope. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the trade have relayed that the simplified application track under the BUD Fund (""Easy BUD"") is very popular among the trade, whether the Government will consider raising the funding ceiling for each ""Easy BUD"" project from $100,000 to $300,000; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether the Government will consider further expanding the application scope of the BUD Fund to cover all markets outside Hong Kong, so as to align with the application scope of the SME Export Marketing Fund which will be consolidated into the BUD Fund next year, thereby better supporting the trade in developing domestic sales, as well as traditional and emerging markets; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) given that the Government's Operating Account is expected to record a surplus in the next financial year, whether the Government will consider adjusting the matching ratio of the BUD Fund to 1:1 of the total approved expenditure between the Government and the enterprises, so as to assist the trade in upgrading their operations; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) is one of the initiatives of the Government in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), aiming at assisting local enterprises in upgrading, transformation and development of diversified markets. From its inception in 2012 to September 2025, nearly 12 000 applications have been approved under the BUD Fund, involving a total funding amount of around $7.5 billion and benefitting around 7 800 enterprises. The Government has since 2018 launched several rounds of enhancements to the BUD Fund, including the injection of a total of $7.7 billion, the expansion of the geographical scope, the phased increase of the cumulative funding ceiling per enterprise from $0.5 million to $7 million, and the launch of ""Easy BUD"" and ""E-commerce Easy"", etc.

 The reply to the three parts of the question by the Hon Sunny Tan is as follows:

(1) ""Easy BUD"" was launched in June 2023 to expedite the processing of applications involving designated measures with a funding amount of $100,000 or below. The application form, requirements for supporting documents and vetting arrangements of ""Easy BUD"" have been streamlined. As compared with the performance pledge for general applications of the BUD Fund, the processing time of an ""Easy BUD"" application has also been significantly reduced by half to within 30 working days.

 As at end-September 2025, a total of 760 applications have been approved under ""Easy BUD"", with an average funding amount of around $72,000. We believe that maintaining the funding ceiling of $100,000 for each application can meet the needs of most enterprises. Besides, to ensure the prudent use of public money, we need to strike a cautious balance between the funding amount and the potential financial risks when determining the funding ceiling of each ""Easy BUD"" application. We consider the current arrangement appropriate.

 In addition, to enable enterprises to receive funding support more expeditiously with a view to coping with the ever-changing economic environment, we have enhanced the arrangement of ""Easy BUD"" since March 2025 to allow each enterprise to submit application once every three months, instead of once every six months in the past. We have also expanded the funding scope to include the establishment of online sales platform.

(2) The current geographical scope of the BUD Fund covers 40 economies with which Hong Kong has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) and/or investment promotion and protection agreements (IPPAs), accounting for around 80 per cent of the total value of Hong Kong's external merchandise trade in 2024. The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address the further expansion of the geographical scope of the BUD Fund to cover eight more economies, including Belt and Road countries, i.e. expanding the geographical scope by 20 per cent, to assist SMEs in developing more diversified markets. Meanwhile, as the SME Export Marketing Fund will be consolidated into the BUD Fund in July 2026, we will enhance promotion and facilitate enterprises' participation in exhibitions and export marketing activities through ""Easy BUD"".

 Hong Kong is exploring the signing of IPPAs with a number of economies, among which the IPPA negotiation with Qatar has been substantially concluded. Both sides will sign the agreement upon completion of respective internal procedures. The geographical scope of the BUD Fund will be further expanded when Hong Kong signs more FTAs or IPPAs in the future. Since March 2025, we have also expanded the geographical scope of ""E-commerce Easy"" to the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

(3) Over the years, the BUD Fund has been actively supporting SMEs, with several rounds of enhancement measures rolled out. At the same time, demand from enterprises for the Government's funding support has surged significantly in recent years. The number of applications for the BUD Fund in 2024 increased by over 320 per cent as compared with that in 2019, and close to 90 per cent of the subsidies under the BUD Fund were approved in the past six years (2019 to 2024).

 To ensure the financial sustainability of the BUD Fund, the Government introduced measures in March 2025, including the adjustment of the funding ratio of the BUD Fund to 1 (Government): 3 (enterprise), such that enterprises could choose appropriate and cost-effective projects more prudently and be more willing to put in resources. Given that the measure was recently launched in March 2025, we need more time to review its effectiveness, and hence do not have plans to adjust the funding ratio.

 Supporting SMEs is one of the Government's important policies. Therefore, the Government will be injecting more than $3 billion into the BUD Fund in the current and the next financial year. This notwithstanding, we need to be mindful of the financial sustainability of the funding scheme with a view to enabling more enterprises to make use of the funding and maintaining an appropriate spread of beneficiaries. As such, the Government will prudently utilise public funds in a timely and focused manner to cope with the complex and ever-changing economic environment.

 Apart from enhancing ""Easy BUD"" and ""E-commerce Easy"", we have been providing more targeted funding support to enterprises in implementing green transformation projects, and have specified that professional fees associated with the establishment of new business entities are fundable, so as to assist enterprises in restructuring their supply chains in the face of challenges brought about by the trade war.

 We will continue to keep in close touch with the trade and will review the implementation of the BUD Fund from time to time to provide appropriate support to SMEs, while taking into account the financial capacity and sustainability of the BUD Fund."
LCQ19: Upgrading facilities at Kowloon Park,2025-10-15 12:45,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500321.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Doreen Kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

There are views that as one of Hong Kong's major urban parks, Kowloon Park is rich with historical heritage and well located. However, with the changes in time, some facilities in the park have become outdated and underutilised, and the overall development potential has yet to be fully realised. Regarding the upgrading of facilities at Kowloon Park, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of users and utilisation rates of various major facilities at Kowloon Park (such as the Swimming pool, Sports Centre, Children's Playground, Discovery Playground) in each of the past three years, as well as the results of satisfaction surveys, with a breakdown by type of facility;

(2) as there are views pointing out that Victoria Park, which is a major urban recreational space like Kowloon Park, has become a popular destination for members of the public and visitors due to its frequent hosting of diversified large-scale events, of the comparison of the utilisation of similar facilities between these two parks (such as swimming pool, sports centre/sports venue, children's playground) in the past three years; whether it has specifically analysed the main reasons for the differences in the utilisation rates of facilities at these two parks;

(3) of the regular mechanisms and specific measures put in place by the authorities to regularly inspect, maintain and revamp the facilities at Kowloon Park to ensure that such facilities meet the needs of the public and remain in good condition; whether it has formulated enhancement plans to raise Kowloon Park's attractiveness to locals and visitors (such as improving spatial planning and design in the park, organising more diversified events), thereby increasing the utilisation rates of facilities in the park;

(4) whether the authorities will consider adopting a public-private partnership model for the renovation works of Kowloon Park, allowing the private sector to participate in the design, operation and maintenance of specific areas in the park, so as to alleviate the Government's financial burden and accelerate the revamp of facilities; and

(5) given that the Government announced last year the conversion of Block 58 of the former Whitfield Barracks in Kowloon Park into a Chinese Culture Experience Centre, and the construction of an Annex Block at the nearby Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters, Tsim Sha Tsui to provide facilities including a Public Information and Education Concourse and an exhibition gallery, etc, how the Government integrates the above projects with the existing facilities and activities in Kowloon Park to create a unified space for recreational, cultural and tourism experience; whether it will establish an inter-departmental collaboration mechanism for the above projects and integration efforts to create synergy effects, thereby enhancing visitor flow and public participation in the area?

Reply:

President,

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) is committed to offering diversified recreation, sports and leisure facilities in the parks under its management, with a view to meeting the public's needs for leisure and recreation activities, advocating healthy lifestyle, and promoting sports to the community. The 13-hectare Kowloon Park is one of the LCSD's major urban parks. It offers a full range of active and passive leisure facilities which are well received by members of the public.

My reply to the questions raised by the Hon Doreen Kong is as follows:

(1) Over the past three years, the usage rates or attendances of the major facilities in Kowloon Park are as follows:




Average usage rate
2022
2023
2024


Sports Centre (Main Arena)
98.3 per cent
96.5per cent
98.2per cent








Attendance
2022
2023
2024


Swimming Pool
521 000
661 000
657 000


Aviary
136 000
168 000
185 000


Bird Lake
266 000
346 000
366 000




The LCSD does not keep relevant information on the attendances of the Children's Playground and the Discovery Playground.

According to a questionnaire survey conducted from July to August 2025, the vast majority (85 per cent) of the respondents were generally ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with Kowloon Park.

(2) Victoria Park and Kowloon Park are popular major parks featuring active and passive facilities. Similar facilities in both parks include swimming pools and children's playgrounds.

The LCSD does not keep information on the attendances of the children's playgrounds concerned. As for the swimming pools, the attendances of the Kowloon Park Swimming Pool and the Victoria Park Swimming Pool over the past three years are as follows:




Attendance
2022
2023
2024


Kowloon Park Swimming Pool
521 000
661 000
657 000


Victoria Park Swimming Pool
469 000
554 000
540 000




Members of the public choose to go swimming in nearby swimming pools based on their place of residence, place of work and daily schedules etc.ãAs such, the attendance of a swimming pool is subject to a series of factors. Besides, some facilities of the Victoria Park and Kowloon Park are available for organisations to hire for staging events of various scales and types, offering diversified park experiences to visitors as well as providing various organisations with quality venues to hold events. Over the past three years, various organisations hired Kowloon Park for more than 110 times to host events such as carnivals, exhibitions, and competitions (e.g. the Hong Kong International Handball Championships, the Hong Kong Rowing Indoor Championships and Charity Rowathon, an event celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a Tai Chi day, and the opening ceremony of Hong Kong Avenue of Comic Stars phase four). Over the same period, Victoria Park was hired over 40 times for holding events, including multiple major events (e.g. Lunar New Year Fair, Hong Kong Flower Show, Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival, Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon, and Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo).

(3) and (4) To continually enhance public service standards, the LCSD has all along been making plans for regular repair and large-scale improvement of various facilities of Kowloon Park taking into account the views of visitors and works departments with a view to enhancing the park visitors' experience, ensuring that the facilities are safe and comfortable, and providing visitors with an even more attractive leisure space.

In the improvement plan for 2024-25, in addition to carrying out routine repair and maintenance works at Kowloon Park, the LCSD has completed the refurbishment works of Chinese Garden and Children's Playground, as well as the enhancement works of fitness facilities and the Hong Kong Avenue of Comic Stars, bringing a better park experience for visitors. In addition, the LCSD installed specially designed and styled panda displays in the recently completed refurbishment project of the fountain at the Water Garden. Outdoor toilets were also enhanced with the introduction of Kung Fu design element for better visual appeal. As for the improvement plan for 2025-26, it will include projects on renovating toilets of the Discovery Playground as well as beautifying the Aviary and flower plots to further enhance the overall environment of the park, thereby providing visitors with more comfortable leisure space and richer natural landscape.

The LCSD will continue to review the usage of park facilities from time to time and, subject to the availability of resources and suitable venue conditions, formulate and carry out appropriate facility enhancement projects as necessary to continue adding unique features to Kowloon Park and enhancing its attractiveness.

In addition, regarding the public-private partnership, subject to its commercial viability and opportunities, the LCSD will keep an open mind, introduce innovative ideas and actively consider adopting public-private partnership proposals in order to enhance the service quality of facilities, thereby providing members of the public with leisure facilities of higher quality and richer visitor experience.

(5) The LCSD will convert Block 58 of the former Whitfield Barracks in Kowloon Park, with the construction of a new annex, into the Chinese Culture Experience Centre which is aiming at promoting Chinese culture. The Experience Centre will feature a versatile outdoor space harmonised with the natural environment of Kowloon Park, serving as a venue for hosting Chinese culture-related activities while offering citizens and tourists a space that combines cultural elements with natural scenery. The Experience Centre will make good use of technology to offer diversified interactive experiences and object-based learning activities to attract participation of both citizens and tourists."
立法會十二題：尖沙咀東的公眾登岸梯台,2025-10-15 12:33,2025-10-15 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500310.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上易志明議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

政府大力推動旅遊業，而維港遊是其中一個深受旅客歡迎的旅遊活動。然而，據悉現時的維港遊主要集中在尖沙咀東海濱進行，惟該處的公眾登岸梯台數量有限，並出現供不應求的情況。有業界人士更指出有船舶霸佔登岸梯台的泊位，導致其他船舶需等候良久才可靠泊，令爭奪泊位的情況時有發生，甚至出現險象環生的危險場面，引發海上安全隱憂。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）尖沙咀東各公眾登岸梯台在平日、周末及內地長假期期間（尤其是黃昏時段）船舶的使用情況及輪候安排分別為何；

（二）有否統計參加維港遊的旅客資料；如有統計，經旅行團及以散客身份參加的人數分別為何；

（三）當局有何措施善用公共資源，以防止有船舶霸佔位於尖沙咀東的公眾登岸梯台，並維持船舶靠泊及旅客登上經營維港遊的船舶的秩序；及

（四）據悉現時在九龍城碼頭附近接待旅行團的食肆及商店數目已大幅減少，不再出現大量旅客聚集的情況，令現時九龍城景雲街公眾登岸梯級的使用量極低，當局會否考慮在可控的情況下，逐步重啓該公眾登岸梯級的使用，例如首先在平日或周末的指定時間，甚至內地長假期期間開放，以分流部分尖沙咀東海濱的維港遊旅客；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

登岸梯台屬於公眾登岸設施，供船隻上落乘客。就尖沙咀東一帶而言，尖沙咀一號梯台現時由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）管理，其餘二號及五號梯台則由運輸署負責管理及監察其使用量；上述公眾登岸梯台均由土木工程拓展署負責其保養及維修。政府會不時檢視公眾登岸設施的使用情況，並聽取持份者的意見，以改善登岸設施的設計及使用安排。

就易志明議員的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）、運輸署及海事處後，現回覆如下：

（一）運輸署約每兩年對其負責管理的逾190個登岸設施（包括公眾碼頭和登岸梯台）進行使用量調查。就尖沙咀東各公眾登岸梯台進行的二○二三至二○二四年度使用量調查結果見於下表：




登岸設施

註一：調查在正常天氣的一天由上午七時至下午八時期間進行。
註二：尖沙咀一號梯台現時由康文署管理，該署沒有備存有關梯台的船隻使用量等資料。

根據康文署及旅遊業監管局（旅監局）的觀察，使用尖沙咀一號梯台參與維港遊活動的運作整體暢順，星光大道的排隊秩序大致良好，未有出現混亂。

（二）現時市場提供觀賞維多利亞港景色的海上旅遊項目及觀光船，供市民和旅客參加。參加維港遊的旅客包括旅行團及個人旅客。

旅行團方面，旅監局估算在二○二五年七月至九月期間，共有約16 000個內地入境旅行團（共約57萬人次）的登記行程中包括乘船遊覽維港（包括參加維港遊或乘搭港內線渡輪）。上述內地入境旅行團一般會在尖沙咀、中環、灣仔或北角上落船。當中接近一半會在尖沙咀區上落船，而其中約八成於天星碼頭登船，餘下約兩成使用尖沙咀一號梯台及其他梯台上落船隻。此外，使用尖沙咀一號梯台上落船的遊覽活動一般為自費項目，團員可按意願自由選擇參與，因此實際參與人數會較登記行程的人數少。

文體旅局並沒有備存旅客以散客身份參加維港遊的數字。

（三）船隻靠泊方面，公眾登岸梯台一般屬全日開放的公共設施，任何船隻只需符合有關的海事規例，保障乘客安全上落船隻，便可使用該等設施。根據《商船（本地船隻）（一般）規例》（第548F章），船隻若在公眾登岸梯台停泊，必須是用作上落乘客用途，且在完成上落乘客後，必須離開公眾登岸梯台，以供其他船隻使用。若於部份時段有較多船隻同時等候使用公眾登岸梯台，船隻需有序輪候，方便乘客上落。

海事處每日在香港各區水域（包括尖沙咀東一帶）巡邏執法，當中包括巡視是否有船隻違規佔用公眾登岸梯台，亦會與警務處進行聯合行動，打擊非法載客、超載等違反海事條例的行為。

旅客秩序方面，旅監局一直密切留意內地入境旅行團登記使用尖沙咀一號梯台參與維港遊的情況，並頻繁地派員巡查及監察該處的運作情況，有關維港遊營辦商均有妥善管理乘客排隊上落的秩序。旅監局亦與旅遊業界、地區人士、警方等保持緊密溝通，推動旅行代理商與維港遊營辦商落實協調、調整及分散旅行團行程的措施，以避免同一時間有過多旅行團聚集於同一地點，並加派人手維持秩序。

（四）現時，九龍城區是最多內地入境旅行團聚集的地區之一，有多個全日對外開放的公眾登岸設施供船隻上落乘客，包括提問提及的景雲街公眾登岸梯級。如維港遊營辦商日後有意在現時上落船地點以外，使用維港兩岸其他登岸設施進行內地入境旅行團維港遊上落客活動，旅監局會與相關的業界、地區人士及政府部門等保持溝通，盡力平衡旅行團在該地點的活動為當區居民生活帶來的影響。"
LCQ12: Public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East,2025-10-15 12:33,2025-10-15 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500317.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Frankie Yick and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  The Government has devoted considerable efforts to promoting tourism, with Victoria Harbour tours being one of the most popular activities among tourists. However, it is learnt that currently Victoria Harbour tours mainly take place along the promenade of Tsim Sha Tsui East, where there is an excessive demand for the limited number of public landing steps. Some industry players have further pointed out that some vessels occupy the berths at the landing steps, forcing other vessels to wait for an extended period of time for berthing. This often leads to competition for berths and even dangerous situations, raising concerns about maritime safety. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective usage and queuing arrangements for the various public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East during weekdays, weekends and Mainland public holidays (particularly during evening hours);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on visitors joining Victoria Harbour tours; if so, of the respective numbers of those joining through tour groups and as individual travellers;

(3) what measures are in place by the authorities to optimize the use of public resources, prevent vessels from occupying the public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East, and maintain order for berthing of vessels and for passengers boarding the vessels for Victoria Harbour tours; and

(4) as it is learnt that nowadays the number of restaurants and shops near Kowloon City Pier catering to tour groups has significantly dwindled and crowds of tourists no longer exist there, resulting in extremely low usage of the public landing steps at King Wan Street, Kowloon City, whether the authorities will consider gradually reactivating the public landing steps there under controlled circumstances, for example, by first allowing access during specified times on weekdays or weekends, or even during Mainland public holidays, so as to divert some of the visitors of Victoria Harbour tours from the promenade of Tsim Sha Tsui East; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Landing steps are public landing facilities for use by vessels for passenger embarkation and disembarkation. Regarding the Tsim Sha Tsui East area, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) currently manages Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1, while the Transport Department (TD) is responsible for managing the remaining Landing No.2 and No.5 and monitoring their utilisation. The Civil Engineering and Development Department is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the aforementioned public landing steps. The Government will review the usage of public landing facilities and gauge the views of stakeholders from time to time to improve the design and usage arrangements of the landing facilities.

  In consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the TD and the Marine Department (MD), my reply to the question raised by the Hon Frankie Yick is as follows:

(1)The TD conducts utilisation surveys on the over 190 landing facilities (including public piers and landing steps) under its management about every two years. Survey findings on the utilisation of public landing steps in Tsim Sha Tsui East in year 2023-2024 are shown in the following table:




Landing facility
Daily utilisation of the facility (Note1)
			(No. of vessels)


Weekdays or Saturdays
Sundays or public holidays


Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 (Note2)
--
--


Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.2
0
0


Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.5
0
0




Note1: The surveys were conducted between 7am and 8pm on a normal weather day.
Note2: Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 is currently managed by LCSD, which does not keep information such as its utilisation by vessels.

  According to the observations of the LCSD and the Travel Industry Authority (TIA), participation in Victoria Harbour tours using Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 has been running smoothly as a whole. The queuing order at the Avenue of Stars is generally good, with no signs of chaos.

(2)At present, marine tourism projects and sightseeing vessels are available in the market for the general public and tourists to enjoy the scenery of the Victoria Harbour. Participants of the Victoria Harbour tours include both tour groups and individual travellers.

  In respect of tour groups, the TIA estimated that between July and September 2025, there were around 16 000 Mainland inbound tour groups (with around 570 000 visitors in total) registered with itineraries including taking vessels to tour the Victoria Harbour (including joining Victoria Harbour tours or taking inner harbour ferry routes). The aforementioned Mainland inbound tour groups generally embark and disembark in Tsim Sha Tsui, Central, Wan Chai or North Point. Nearly half of these groups will embark and disembark in the Tsim Sha Tsui area, among which around 80 per cent will embark at the Star Ferry Pier, while the remaining around 20 per cent will use Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 and other landing steps for embarkation and disembarkation. In addition, tour activities using Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No.1 for embarkation and disembarkation are generally self-paid activities, which tour group members could freely choose to participate according to their preference, hence the actual number of participants may be lower than that registered with the itineraries.

  The CSTB does not keep figures on the number of tourists who participated in Victoria Harbour tours in the capacity of individual travellers.

(3)In terms of berthing by vessels, public landing steps are generally public facilities that are open all day and for use by all vessels provided that they comply with the relevant marine regulations to ensure safe embarkation and disembarkation of passengers. Under the Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (General) Regulation (Cap.548F), the purpose of berthing at public landing steps should be to enable embarkation and disembarkation of passengers on or from a vessel only. Upon completion of which, the vessel concerned must leave the public landing steps to allow berthing by other vessels. During periods of high demand for the public landing steps, vessels are required to queue up in an orderly manner so as to facilitate passenger embarkation and disembarkation.

  The MD conducts daily patrols and law enforcement in various Hong Kong waters (including the Tsim Sha Tsui East area), including against unauthorised occupation of the public landing steps by vessels. The MD also conducts joint operations with the Police to combat conducts in violation of marine legislations such as illegal carriage of passengers and overloading.

  In terms of order of the tourists, the TIA has been closely monitoring the situation of registered Mainland inbound tour groups using Tsim Sha Tsui Landing No. 1 to participate in Victoria Harbour tours, and frequently deploying staff to monitor and inspect the operating situation on site. The Victoria Harbour operators concerned have been properly managing the order of passengers queuing for embarkation and disembarkation. The TIA also maintains close communication with members of the travel trade, districts, the Police, etc, to facilitate measures to be implemented by travel agents and Victoria Harbour tour operators to co-ordinate, adjust and stagger the itineraries of tour groups, as well as deploy additional manpower to maintain order, with a view to avoiding excessive concentration of tour groups at the same location at the same time.

(4)Kowloon City is currently one of the districts gathered with the largest number of Mainland inbound tour groups. There are multiple public landing facilities that are open all day for use by vessels for passenger embarkation and disembarkation, including the King Wan Street Landing mentioned in the question. If Victoria Harbour tour operators intend to use landing facilities along both sides of the Victoria Harbour other than the current embarkation and disembarkation points for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers from Mainland inbound tour groups participating in Victoria Harbour tours, the TIA will maintain close liaison with relevant members of the trade, districts, Government departments, etc, striving to balance the impact of tour group activities on the local communities at the locations concerned."

In parallel, this year's Policy Address has proposed various initiatives to promote the development and application of AI. The State Council also issued in August this year the Opinions on Further Implementing the ""Artificial Intelligence Plus"" Action (the Opinions) setting out phased objectives including realisation of extensive and in-depth integration of AI with six key areas by 2027, full AI empowerment for highâquality development by 2030, and full entry into a new stage of intelligent economic and societal development by 2035. Furthermore, the Opinions propose accelerating the implementation of six key actions, including Artificial Intelligence Plus in scientific and technology, industrial development, consumption upgrades, people's livelihoods and well-being, governance capacity, and global cooperation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will, by drawing on the practices of other countries and regions, comprehensively review the promotion of AI development in Hong Kong and map out future strategies;

(2) whether it will establish a phased target for Hong Kong to take forward the ""Artificial Intelligence Plus"" action by drawing reference from the objectives and key actions set out in the Opinions;

(3) whether it will formulate policy initiatives to, apart from providing support to individual enterprises, proactively promote the application of AI technology in various industries, thereby enhancing the overall competitiveness of various industries in Hong Kong; and

(4) whether it has reviewed if existing efforts to nurture AI talent are adequate to meet future demand, and whether targets have been set for manpower training in relation to the development of AI in Hong Kong?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the relevant bureaux, my consolidated reply to the questions raised by Professor the Hon William Wong is as follows:

  AI is leading a new round of scientific and technological revolution, as well as industry transformation. Major economies around the world are leveraging their unique strengths to formulate AI strategies and objectives that align with their development needs. We can see that the global AI development landscape and the strategic deployments of various countries, including the ""AI+"" initiative proposed by our nation last year, as well as the Opinions on Deepening the Implementation of the ""AI Plus"" Initiative released in August this year, focus on key areas such as scientific research innovation, computing infrastructure, data supply, and talent cultivation. These efforts aim to promote the deep integration and application innovation of AI across various industries and sectors of the economy and society.

For Hong Kong, since the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint (the Blueprint) put forth a strategic focus on the development of AI, the Government has set out clear goals for the development of AI, with a focus on ""strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach"". Steady progress has been made in various key areas, including research, infrastructure, data, industry applications, and talent nurturing. The multi-dimensional AI policies and specific measures in Hong Kong are not only in line with the national ""AI+"" initiative but also highly coherent with the global development path of AI. We will also timely review the implementation status and optimise individual policies and support measures according to the latest development needs, to enable AI to empower high-quality development.

In terms of innovative research and development (R&D), the Government has funded the establishment of 16 R&D laboratories focusing on AI and robotic technologies through the AIR@InnoHK research cluster, pooling over a thousand experts and strengthening Hong Kong's capabilities in foundational AI research.

We have just obtained funding approval of $1 billion from the Legislative Council for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute (AIRDI) in 2026, which will facilitate upstream AI R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes, as well as expansion of application scenarios.

Regarding computing infrastructure, Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) will further uplift its computing power within this year to meet the local demand of computing power. To support local institutions, R&D institutes and enterprises in fully utilising the computing power of the AISC, we have launched the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme to support large-scale AI scientific research and applications. To date, it has successfully approved more than ten major projects.

In addition, we have just put up for tender a site at Sandy Ridge in the North District for the development of a data facility cluster. It will provide advanced computing power facilities, promoting the development of data and AI-related industries.

In terms of data supply, the Government has been actively implementing the open data policy and encouraging public and private organisations to open up more high-quality data, with a view to providing essential elements for the development of AI in Hong Kong. Currently, the Open Data Portal has published over 5 600 datasets, covering various industries and sectors including finance, education, transportation, community and social welfare, law and security, etc., providing important support for the industries in training algorithms and developing large language models.

Regarding cross-boundary data, the Digital Policy Office introduced the Standard Contract facilitation measure based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to facilitate the safe and orderly cross-boundary flow of data. We will also actively explore the early establishment of a compliant and secure mechanism for cross-boundary flow of Mainland data to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone for scientific research purposes, supporting AI application testing and innovation.

To assist various industries in fully seizing the opportunities brought by AI, the 2025 Policy Address proposed the enhancement of Cyberport's Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to empower small and medium enterprises to apply AI solutions through matching resources. The AIRDI will also provide professional advice and recommendations to address the difficulties and pain points encountered by different industries or enterprises in the application of AI. This will assist the industry in effectively matching AI solutions that meet their business needs, extensively expanding AI application scenarios in industries, and enhancing industry competitiveness, thereby facilitating ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"".

Talent is vital in the global AI race. Following the development strategy and goal of enriching innovation and technology (I&T) talent resources and developing an international talent hub outlined in the Blueprint, we have been fully advancing various initiatives to attract overseas AI talent and nurture local AI talent. In particular, we have launched the $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme in September this year to support Universities Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities to attract international top-notch scientific researchers in AI and other fields to Hong Kong to spearhead basic research in frontier technologies. The key initiatives for nurturing local AI talent are as follows:

(i) In terms of secondary and primary schools, the Government has set aside $2 billion in the Quality Education Fund to support the implementation of digital education and will formulate the Blueprint for Digital Education, including optimising the interface between primary and secondary curricula of Information Technology and I&T education, and setting out an ""AI literacy"" learning framework; collaborate with professional bodies to roll out pilot schemes on AI education and enhance AI-related training for teachers; and launch progressively digital platforms and tools equipped with AI under the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme for schools;

(ii) With the support of the Government, the Vocational Training Council established the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology in 2023, which offered a number of AI-related training programmes such as the Higher Diploma in AI and Smart Technology, the Higher Diploma in Data Science and AI, the Higher Diploma in Applied AI, etc.;

(iii) The UGC encourages universities to offer more programmes related to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics) and the ""eight centres"" (including international I&T centre) under the National 14th Five-Year Plan. Currently, several universities have offered AI-related UGC-funded undergraduate programmes; and

(iv) Provide internship opportunities in the I&T sector for university students enrolled in STEM (Science, Technology, engineering and mathematics) related programmes through the STEM Internship Scheme."

社會各界一直關注輸入勞工政策對本地勞工就業機會及勞工權益的影響，而二○二五年《施政報告》的附篇亦表示政府會在二○二六年第二季公布檢討「補充勞工優化計劃」的結果，當中包括保障本地勞工優先就業的措施。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）自二○二三年至今，每月各項輸入勞工計劃的申請及獲批宗數為何，並按（i）申請公司的行業分類（依據政府統計處就勞工統計所劃分的行業主類）和（ii）職業分類，以及（iii）‍每宗申請所涉及的輸入勞工人數（例如一人至10人、11人至20人等）列出分項數字；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，勞工處自去年四月起先後關閉三所就業中心，顯著縮減就業中心及行業性招聘中心網絡，令部分本地求職者難以取得即時及全面的就業支援服務，而參加招聘會以獲得即場面試的機會亦相應減少，政府作出有關安排的原因為何；鑑於本港失業率自今年初起有回升趨勢，部分行業（例如建造業）的失業率升幅尤其顯著，但另一方面卻不斷有公司申請輸入勞工，反映本港仍存在一定的就業及招聘需求，勞工處會否考慮回復就業中心及行業性招聘中心的數目（或最低限度維持現有數目），並適度增加招聘會數目，以加強協助本地勞工求職；

（三）自二○二三年至今，每年勞工處就業中心及行業性招聘中心的服務人次、舉辦招聘會數目、參加招聘會的人次及僱主數目、每場招聘會提供的面試平均數目，以及每年該等數據的增減幅度分別為何；

（四）據悉除了建造業輸入勞工計劃明確規定申請公司必須舉辦招聘日，以及飲食業僱主在輸入指定職位時必須在勞工處的就業中心舉行招聘會外，其他輸入勞工計劃／行業並無相關硬性要求，原因為何；

（五）有否考慮要求所有申請輸入勞工的僱主（不論行業、工種及申請輸入勞工數目）必須在勞工處就業中心及行業性招聘中心舉辦招聘日及登記招聘職位，以便利本地求職者申請有關空缺，並確保有關的本地招聘過程公正及真誠，從而杜絕「假招聘」的情況；

（六）自二○二三年至今，每年當局收到多少宗有關以輸入勞工取代本地工人的投訴，當中涉及的行業為何；該等投訴的調查進度及結果為何；當局有何措施進一步防止僱主以輸入勞工取代本地工人；及

（七）鑑於市場上有中介公司／機構（包括非持牌職業介紹所）聲稱可收費協助本地公司申請輸入勞工，當局有否計劃就此作出規管，以保障本地工人、輸入勞工及申請僱主的權益？

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，政府在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，適度容許僱主確實未能在本地聘得合適人手時申請輸入勞工，推動香港的經濟發展。勞工及福利局於二○二三年六月十九日為院舍服務業推出「院舍輸入護理員特別計劃」，發展局和運輸及物流局於二○二三年七月十七日分別為建造業和運輸業（包括航空業及公共小巴／客車行業）推出行業輸入勞工計劃。此外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），容許有實際需要的僱主申請輸入原有「補充勞工計劃」下一般不得輸入（包括26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位）的勞工。

就議員的提問，經諮詢發展局和運輸及物流局後，現答覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年九月，上述各輸入勞工計劃的申請和獲批宗數載於附件一；優化計劃下申請和獲批宗數按行業劃分的分項數字載於附件二。政府沒有備存每宗申請及獲批並按職業分類及涉及輸入勞工人數劃分的分項統計數字。

（二）及（三）勞工處的就業中心及行業性招聘中心，為求職人士提供多元化及免費的就業服務。此外，勞工處的「互動就業服務」網站及流動應用程式，為求職人士提供24小時網上就業服務和就業資訊。求職人士亦可利用電話就業服務中心的求職人士熱線獲取就業服務。

鑑於現時市民使用網上就業服務的情況日趨普及，為更有效運用公共資源，勞工處於二○二四年四月起調整及優化其就業服務，包括延長就業中心和行業性招聘中心的每日服務時間；電話就業服務中心於辦公時間外增設電話留言服務；以及合併部分就業中心，重新配置人力資源，為市民提供更具成本效益的服務。

二○二三年至二○二五年九月，就業中心及行業性招聘中心每年到訪人數、舉行招聘會數目、參與僱主數目、安排即場面試數目及每場招聘會平均面試數目的統計數字載於附件三。數據顯示，二○二四年起就業中心及行業性招聘中心的每年到訪人數、即場面試數目及每場招聘會平均安排的面試數目均錄得增長。與此同時，勞工處「互動就業服務」網站及流動應用程式錄得的瀏覽和使用次數亦按年遞升，顯示就業中心與網上服務的資源重新配置能繼續為求職者提供適切的服務。

勞工處會繼續密切監察就業市場的變化，適時檢視各項服務，並因應服務需求及市場情況調整及優化服務。

（四）及（五）各輸入勞工計劃的規定和執行安排均確保本地工人優先就業。有關措施包括申請輸入勞工的僱主必須先以不低於市場相類職位的每月工資中位數按有關計劃的規定進行本地公開招聘，優先聘請合資格的本地工人填補空缺。僱主亦必須與輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約，並支付不低於相類職位中位工資的薪金，防止輸入勞工成為廉價勞工，損害本地工人的就業機會。此外，申請輸入勞工的僱主必須符合本地僱員與輸入勞工的人手比例規定。

就優化計劃而言，僱主須以勞工處同意的招聘條件就申請職位進行本地招聘，其間勞工處會在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料，為有關空缺進行就業選配，並將空缺資料發布給勞工顧問委員會委員、相關職工會及培訓機構，以便他們轉介合適的本地求職人士應徵。僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果，如僱主未能成功招聘合適人選，勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會中止處理有關申請。勞工處亦會向僱主施加行政制裁，拒絕處理他們提交的其他申請，禁制期可達兩年。

二○二五年《施政報告》宣布，由二○二五年九月十八日起，經優化計劃申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師時，僱主須進行的本地招聘由四星期延長至六星期，並須每周參加一次勞工處指定的在就業中心舉行的招聘會。這措施顧及個別行業勞動力市場的變化並聚焦於輸入勞工較多的指定工種。政府會繼續動態監察就業情況，靈活調整實施安排，致力確保本地就業優先。

（六）獲批准輸入勞工的僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。勞工處自二○二五年六月起實施新措施，包括在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴。此外，勞工處的勞工督察不時巡查輸入勞工的工作地點，查核僱主有否遵守優化計劃的規定。僱主如違反相關規定，勞工處會對有關僱主作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

勞工處自二○二三年九月四日推行優化計劃以來，於二○二三年（九月四‍日至十二月三十一日）、二○二四年及二○二五年（截至九月三十日）分別接獲一宗、19宗及321宗懷疑僱主以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員的投訴。有關投訴主要涉及餐飲服務業、製造業及清潔服務業。勞工處已就所有收到的投訴展開調查，包括到輸入勞工的工作地點進行巡查及搜證，並向僱主及僱員詳細查證在輸入勞工到職後本地員工的數目有否減少、減少的原因及僱主有否進行本地招聘填補已離職的本地僱員。

上述接獲的投訴中，勞工處已完成調查68宗個案，其中67宗沒有足夠證據確立僱主違反優化計劃的規定，而其他投訴個案仍在調查中。就一宗違反規定的個案，勞工處於二○二五年八月二十九日公布，向該名僱主施加行政制裁，撤銷該僱主就優化計劃已獲發的輸入勞工原則性批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

（七）任何人士或機構，如在香港經營為他人覓取職位或向僱主提供員工為目的的業務，均屬經營職業介紹所，並受《僱傭條例》、《職業介紹所規例》及《職業介紹所實務守則》規管。不論經營模式或所介紹的職務類別（包括輸入勞工），所有在香港經營的職業介紹所必須事先領有勞工處發出的牌照。如發現有任何人士或機構在本港無牌經營職業介紹所，勞工處會嚴肅調查及採取執法行動，並在有足夠證據時提出檢控。勞工處亦在優化計劃的專題網頁提醒市民對聲稱提供招聘內地勞工服務的廣告或信息提高警覺，必須核實相關企業或香港職業介紹所的經營資格，以免受騙或被誤導，導致金錢損失或申請延誤。

此外，政府規定根據各輸入勞工計劃獲原則性批准／配額的僱主如擬從內地輸入勞工，必須由獲國家商務部批准並取得對香港特別行政區勞務合作經營資格的勞務企業進行招聘，加強對內地勞工的保障。政府已推行監管機制，規定僱主向入境事務處（入境處）申請內地輸港勞工的進入許可時，必須提交載有相關核准勞務企業資料的指定文件，否則入境處不會處理有關申請。"
LCQ14: Ensuring local workers' employment priority and labour rights,2025-10-15 12:18,2025-10-15 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500252.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Tang Fei and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 Various sectors in the community have all along been concerned about the impact of labour importation policy on local workers' employment opportunities and labour rights, and the Supplement to the 2025 Policy Address also states that the Government will announce the findings of the review of the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme in the second quarter of 2026, including measures to safeguard employment priority for local workers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the monthly number of applications received and approved under various labour importation schemes since 2023, with a breakdown by (i) type of industry of the applicant companies (based on the industry section defined by the Census and Statistics Department for labour statistics), (ii) classification of occupations, and (iii) the number of imported workers involved in each application (e.g. One to 10 persons, 11 to 20 persons, etc);

(2) as there are views pointing out that the Labour Department (LD) has closed three job centres since April last year, which has significantly reduced the network of job centres and industry-based recruitment centres and made it difficult for some local job seekers to obtain immediate and comprehensive employment support services, prompting the chances of getting on-the-spot interviews by attending job fairs to reduce correspondingly, of the reasons for making such arrangements; given that unemployment rate in Hong Kong has rebounded since the beginning of this year, and the increase was particularly notable in some industries such as construction, and on the other hand some companies have continuously applied for labour importation, indicating that there is considerable needs for employment and recruitment in Hong Kong, whether the LD will consider reinstating the number of job centres and industry-based recruitment centres (or at least maintaining the current number) and appropriately increasing the number of job fairs to enhance support for local workers in job-seeking;

(3) of the respective number of service users of LD's job centres and industry-based recruitment centres in each year since 2023, the number of job fairs organised, the number of attendances and employers participating in the job fairs, the average number of interviews offered in each job fair, and the respective rates of change of such numbers in each year;

(4) as it is learnt that apart from the explicit requirement for applicant companies to arrange recruitment days under the Labour Importation Scheme for the Construction Sector and the requirement for employers of the catering industry to organise job fairs at the LD's job centres when importing workers for designated posts, there is no such mandatory requirements for other labour importation schemes/industries, of the reasons for that;

(5) whether it has considered requiring all employers applying for labour importation (regardless of industry, job category and number of workers applied for) to arrange recruitment days and register available jobs at the LD's job centres and industry-based recruitment centres so as to facilitate local job seekers to apply for such vacancies and ensure fairness and sincerity in the local recruitment process, thereby eliminating ""bogus recruitment"";

(6) of the number of complaints received by the authorities regarding the displacement of local workers with imported workers in each year since 2023 and the industries involved; of the progress and findings of the investigations into such complaints; of the authorities' measures in place to further prevent employers from displacing local workers with imported workers; and

(7) given that intermediaries/organisations (including unlicensed employment agencies) in the market have claimed to assist local companies in applying for labour importation subject to a charge, whether the authorities have plans for regulation in this regard to protect the rights of local workers, imported workers and applicant employers?

Reply:

President,

 To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and foster Hong Kong's economic development, the Government, on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, suitably allows employers with genuine difficulty in recruiting suitable local workers to apply for importation of workers. On June 19, 2023, the Labour and Welfare Bureau introduced the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for Residential Care Homes for the residential care home sector. On July 17, 2023, the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) respectively launched sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction and transport sectors (including the aviation industry and the public light bus/coach trade). In addition, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023, allowing employers with genuine needs to apply for importation of workers for posts that were generally excluded under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme (including the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts).

 In consultation with the DEVB and the TLB, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) As at September 2025, the numbers of applications received and approved under various labour importation schemes are at Annex 1. A breakdown of the numbers of applications received and approved by industry under the ESLS is at Annex 2. The Government does not maintain breakdowns of the numbers of applications received and approved by post and number of imported workers involved in each application.

(2) and (3) The LD provides diversified and free employment services to job seekers through its job centres and industry-based recruitment centres. In addition, LD's Interactive Employment Service website (iES) and mobile application offer round-the-clock online employment services and employment information. Job seekers can also call the job seeker hotline of the Telephone Employment Service Centre (TESC) of the LD to obtain employment services.

 In view of the increasing popularity of online employment services among the general public and to utilise public resources more effectively, the LD has adjusted and enhanced its employment services since April 2024, including extending the daily service hours of job centres and industry-based recruitment centres, introducing voicemail service of the TESC outside office hours, merging certain job centres and redeploying manpower resources, to provide more costâeffective services to members of the public.

 From 2023 to September 2025, the numbers of visitors, job fairs held, participating employers, on-the-spot interviews arranged and the average number of interviews per job fair recorded by job centres and industry-based recruitment centres each year are at Annex 3. The data indicates that from 2024 onwards, job centres and industry-based recruitment centres have recorded increases in the numbers of annual visitors and on-the-spot interviews as well as the average number of interviews per job fair. In tandem, the numbers of page views and usage counts for the iES website and mobile application also recorded year-on-year increases, indicating that the job centres and online employment services continue to provide optimal services to job seekers after redeploying the resources.

 The LD will continue to closely monitor changes in the employment market, review the services provided in a timely manner, and make adjustments and enhancements to services in light of the service needs and market situation.
     
(4) and (5) The requirements and implementation arrangements of various labour importation schemes ensure the employment priority for local workers. Relevant measures include employers applying for importation of labour must first undertake local open recruitment according to the requirements of relevant schemes at a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market and accord priority to employing qualified local workers to fill the job vacancies. Employers must also sign a Standard Employment Contract with imported workers, and shall pay a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position to prevent the imported workers from becoming ""cheap labour"" and undermining the employment opportunities of local workers. Besides, employers applying for importation of labour should meet the manning ratio requirement of local employees to imported workers.

 For the ESLS, employers shall adopt the recruitment terms agreed by the LD and undergo local recruitment for the applied posts. During the recruitment period, the LD will publish the job vacancies on iES, conduct job matching for relevant vacancies and disseminate the vacancy information to members of the Labour Advisory Board, relevant trade unions and training institutions to facilitate their referral of suitable local job seekers for application. Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results to the LD. If an employer is unsuccessful in employing suitable candidate(s), the LD will contact each local job seeker who is not employed to verify the interview details. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable grounds, the LD will terminate the processing of the relevant application. The LD will also impose administrative sanction on the employer and refuse to process any other application(s) submitted by the concerned employer, with a debarment period up to two years.

 The 2025 Policy Address announced that, with effect fromSeptember 18, 2025, the local recruitment period of employers applying for importing waiters/waitresses and junior cooks will be extended from four weeks to six weeks, during which an employer must attend an on-site job fair once a week at a job centre assigned by the LD. This measure takes into account changes in the labour market of individual industries and focuses on job categories with more imported workers. The Government will continue to closely monitor changes in the employment situation and adopt a flexible approach to adjust the implementation arrangements, striving to ensure the priority for local employment.

(6) Employers approved to import workers shall not displace serving local employees with imported workers. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. The LD has implemented new measures since June 2025, including launching an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers over suspected breaches of the ESLS requirements. In addition, Labour Inspectors of the LD conduct inspections of workplaces of imported workers from time to time to verify whether employers are complying with the ESLS requirements. If an employer has violated relevant requirements, the LD will impose administrative sanction on that employer, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted to the employer and refusal to process other subsequent applications for labour importation in the following two years.

 Since the implementation of the ESLS on September 4, 2023, the LD received one, 19 and 321 complaints in 2023 (from September 4 to December 31), 2024 and 2025 (as at September 30) respectively alleging that employers had displaced serving local employees with imported workers. These complaints mainly involved food and beverage services, manufacturing and cleaning services. The LD has launched investigations into all complaints received, including conducting inspections and evidence-gathering at the workplaces of imported workers, verifying with employers and employees in detail whether the numbers of local staff had decreased after the arrival of imported workers, the reasons for the decrease and whether the employers had undertaken local recruitment to fill the vacancies left by the departing local workers.

 Of the above complaints received, the LD completed the investigation of 68 cases, of which 67 did not have sufficient evidence to establish that the employers had violated the ESLS requirements, while the remaining cases are still under investigation. In one of the cases where a violation was found, the LD announced on August 29, 2025 the imposition of administrative sanction on that employer, and withdrew the approvals for importation of labour previously granted and refused to process its subsequent applications for labour importation in the following two years.

(7) Any person or institution who operates a business in Hong Kong for the purpose of obtaining employment for another person or supplying the labour of another person to an employer is regarded as an employment agency (EA) and is subject to regulation under the Employment Ordinance, the Employment Agency Regulations and the Code of Practice for Employment Agencies. All EAs operating in Hong Kong, regardless of their mode of operation or categories of jobs offered (including those involving imported workers), must first obtain an EA licence issued by the LD before commencing operation. If any person or institution is found operating an EA without a valid licence, the LD will conduct investigations seriously and take enforcement actions, and instigate prosecution where there is sufficient evidence to substantiate an offence. The LD also reminds the public on the dedicated webpage of the ESLS to stay vigilant towards advertisements or messages claiming to provide servicesfor recruiting Mainland workers and to ascertain the capability of an enterprise to operate the business to avoid being deceived or misled, which may result in financial loss or delay in the processing of applications.

 Besides, to strengthen the protection for Mainland workers, the Government requires employers who are granted approval-in-principle/quotas to import workers under various labour importation schemes and intend to import workers from the Mainland must recruit the workers through enterprises which have been approved by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and granted the permission to operate business on labour service co-operation with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Government has implemented a monitoring mechanism that requires employers to submit designated documents containing information about the relevant approved labour service enterprises when applying for entry permits for the Mainland workers with the Immigration Department (ImmD). Otherwise, the ImmD will not process relevant applications."
立法會十六題：便利表演團體來港的措施,2025-10-15 12:10,2025-10-15 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500268.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上陳恒鑌議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

政府宣布於今年二月二十六日起，就各項人才與資本投資者的入境計劃（指明入境計劃）增設申請費600元，並將簽證／入境證的簽發費分別上調至600元（逗留期限180日或以下）及1,300元（逗留期限181日或以上）。有意見反映，上述簽證收費對由其他地區來港並靠捐款維持營運的表演團體（例如在盂蘭勝會表演的神功戲戲班）造成沉重的財政壓力，影響傳統文化的傳承及交流。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年經指明入境計劃獲批來港的中國內地民間傳統表演團體（包括神功戲戲班）數目及所涉及的人員為何（以表列出）；

（二）據悉不少地區團體在慶典活動時均會邀請中國內地的表演團體來港演出，以促進文化交流，政府會否考慮對該等沒有向公眾收取演出費用的表演團體人員豁免簽證申請費及簽發費，或推行分級收費制度，以鼓勵民間的文化交流及促進文化遺產傳承；

（三）自「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）於二○二四年恆常化以來，透過該計劃獲准在以訪客身分逗留期間，參與文化藝術界別指定短期活動的中國內地表演團體數目為何；及

（四）鑑於有意見指出，地區團體對民間傳統表演團體表演的需求甚殷，但表演團體透過短期訪客計劃來港須獲得認可主辦機構（例如文化體育及旅遊局）以邀請信的方式作出認可，過程上存在一定難度，政府會否考慮進一步簡化相關申請程序，以令更多表演團體可在無須申請工作簽證的情況下來港交流？

答覆：

主席：

就陳恒鑌議員的提問，經諮詢保安局、勞工及福利局及入境事務處（入境處）後，現回覆如下：

（一）具備香港所需且缺乏的特別技能、知識或經驗的內地居民，可在符合條件的情況下透過「輸入內地人才計劃」（提問所指的「指明入境計劃」）申請來港工作，包括短期或一次性項目為本的工作。二○二二年、二○二三年及二○二四年間，「輸入內地人才計劃」下的獲批申請中，涉及「藝術／文化界別」內地人才的獲批申請數目分別為285宗、2 496宗及4 618宗。入境處並無備存當中涉及內地民間傳統表演團體（包括神功戲戲班）的分項統計數字。

（二）至（四）政府在制訂「輸入內地人才計劃」的收費水平時已平衡各方面的考慮因素。其中，考慮到部分申請涉及短期／一次性項目的工作，政府實施兩級制簽發費，逗留期限為180日或以下的簽證／入境證簽發費為600元，而181日或以上的則為1,300元，屬合理和可負擔範圍水平。政府會密切留意相關情況，按機制適時檢討收費架構。

此外，為促進更多人才訪港交流，政府於二○二二年六月推出為期兩年的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利先導計劃」（先導計劃），並於二○二四年六月把先導計劃恆常化為「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）。在短期訪客計劃下，獲政府相關決策局／部門認可的機構可向界別內相關的非本地人才發出邀請信，獲邀人士可以訪客身分來港參與指定短期活動，而無須向入境處申請工作簽證／進入許可。他們每次來港可在不超過連續14個曆日期間參與指定短期活動，並可就該指定活動收取報酬。

截至二○二五年六月底，先導計劃及短期訪客計劃已合共批准讓超過36 950名非本地人才以訪客身分來港參與共6 200多項短期活動及盛事。其中，自二○二四年六月恆常化以來，共有超過1520名非本地人才獲批參與「文化藝術」界別下的指定短期活動。入境處沒有備存提問提及內地表演團體透過短期訪客計劃來港的統計數字。

為確保短期訪客計劃與時並進，政府不時審視計劃的涵蓋範圍及運作機制，務求使計劃能夠在風險可控的前提下，持續有效地促進相關界別發展，並提升香港的國際形象。自先導計劃推出以來，政府分別在二○二三年二月及二○二四年六月擴大計劃，在原有10個指定界別外，增加「金融」及「發展與建築」兩個界別，認可機構亦從計劃剛推出時約350個增加18%至現時的400多個，當中包括政府決策局／部門、公營／法定機構、專業組織和業界協會等。計劃下設有機制，各參與的政策局／部門均需協助把關，確保計劃的執行持續符合政策目標。短期訪客計劃的相關資料，包括目前涵蓋的認可機構和指定短期活動已上載入境處網站︰www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/visas/stv.html。

政府會繼續留意短期訪客計劃的實施情況和相關部門及業界的意見，適時檢討計劃的涵蓋範圍，以期在入境管制與便利之間取得適當平衡。在考慮是否進一步放寬短期訪客計劃時，政府必須考慮兩大原則，即合資格根據計劃來港進行指定短期活動的人士不會取代本地勞動力，及不會構成濫用風險（包括非法就業）。"
LCQ16: Measures to facilitate entry of performing groups into Hong Kong,2025-10-15 12:10,2025-10-15 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500270.htm,"âFollowing is a question by Dr the Hon Chan Han-pan and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

As announced by the Government, with effective from February 26 this year, a new application fee of $600 has been introduced for various admission schemes for talents and capital investors (specified admission schemes), and the visa/entry permit issuance fees have been raised to $600 (with a limit of stay of 180 days or below) and $1,300 (with a limit of stay of 181 days or more) respectively. There are views relaying that the aforesaid visa fees have put heavy financial pressure on performing groups coming from other places to Hong Kong and relying on donations to maintain their operation (e.g. Shengong opera troupes performing at the Yu Lan Festival), thus affecting the transmission and exchange of traditional cultures. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of Chinese Mainland traditional folklore performing groups (including Shengong opera troupes) admitted to Hong Kong under the specified admission schemes in each of the past three years, as well as their members involved (set out in a table);

(2) as it is learnt that quite a number of district organisations will invite Chinese Mainland performing groups to perform in Hong Kong during celebration events to promote cultural exchanges, whether the Government will consider waiving visa application and issuance fees or introducing a tiered fee system for members of those performing groups which do not charge the public for their performances, so as to encourage cultural exchanges in the community and promote the transmission of cultural heritage;

(3) of the number of Chinese Mainland performing groups permitted under the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (the STV Scheme) to participate in specified short-term activities in the arts and cultural sector during their stay as visitors since the regularisation of the scheme in 2024; and

(4) as there are views pointing out that although there is strong demand from district organisations for performances by traditional folklore performing groups, the visits of performing groups to Hong Kong via the STV Scheme are subject to the endorsement of the authorised host organisations (e.g. the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau) by way of invitation letters, which involves some difficulties in the process, whether the Government will consider further streamlining the relevant application procedures to enable more performing groups to come to Hong Kong for exchanges without having to apply for employment visas?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Security Bureau, the Labour and Welfare Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), the reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Chan Han-pan is as follows:

(1) Eligible Mainland residents who possess special skills, knowledge or experience of value to and not readily available in Hong Kong may apply to come to work in Hong Kong under the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP) (the ""specified admission scheme"" as referred to in the question), including short-term or one-off project-based employment, if the conditions are met. In 2022, 2023, and 2024, the numbers of approved applications under the ASMTP related to the Mainland talents of the arts/culture sector were 285, 2 496 and 4 618 respectively. The ImmD does not maintain a breakdown of the statistics on applications involving traditional folk performing groups from the Mainland (including Shengong opera troupes).

(2) to (4) In devising the fee levels for the ASMTP, the Government has balanced various considerations. Among others, noting that some applications relate to short-term/one-off project-based employment, the Government has introduced two tiers of visa/entry permit issuance fee: $600 for visa/entry permit granted with a limit of stay of not more than 180 days, and $1,300 for those with a limit of stay of 181 days or more. The fee levels are modest and affordable. The Government will closely monitor the relevant situation and review the fee structure as appropriate in accordance with the established mechanism.

Besides, to encourage more talents to come to Hong Kong for exchanges, the Government launched a two-year Pilot Scheme on Immigration Facilitation for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (Pilot Scheme) in June 2022, which was regularised as the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) in June 2024. Under the STV Scheme, organisations authorised by the relevant government bureaux/departments (B/Ds) can issue invitation letters to relevant non-local talents in their sectors. Invited persons may come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the ImmD. They may participate in specified short-term activities for up to 14 consecutive calendar days during each trip to Hong Kong, and receive remuneration for the specified activities concerned.

As of end-June 2025, the Pilot Scheme and the STV Scheme have approved for a total of more than 36950 non-local talents to enter Hong Kong as visitors to participate in a total of over 6 200 short-term activities and major events. Among others, since the regularisation of the scheme in June2024, a total of more than 1520 non-local talents have been approved to participate in the specified short-term activities under the ""Arts and Cultural"" sector. The ImmD does not maintain statistics of Mainland performing groups entering Hong Kong under the STVScheme as mentioned in the question.

To ensure that the STV Scheme keeps pace with the times, the Government reviews its coverage and operation mechanism from time to time, with a view to ensuring that it can continue to effectively promote the development of relevant sectors and raise Hong Kong's international profile while ensuring that the risks are manageable. Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the Government has expanded the scheme in February 2023 and June 2024, by adding two sectors, namely ""Finance"" and ""Development and Construction"", to the original 10 designated sectors. The number of authorised organisations has also increased by 18 per cent from around 350 when the scheme was first launched, to more than 400 at present. These authorised organisations include government B/Ds, public/statutory organisations, professional bodies and industry associations. Through an established mechanism, all participating B/Ds are required to assist in ensuring that the implementation of the scheme consistently meets policy objectives. Relevant information of the STVScheme, including the authorised organisations and specified short-term activities that are currently covered by the scheme, is available on the ImmD's website: www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/stv.html.

The Government will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the STVScheme as well as the views of the relevant departments and the sectors concerned, and timely review the scheme's coverage to strike an appropriate balance between immigration control and facilitation. In considering whether to further relax the STV Scheme, the Government shall take into account two major principles, i.e. eligible individuals visiting Hong Kong for specified short-term activities under the scheme will not displace the local workforce, and there will not be a risk of abuse (including illegal employment)."

答覆：

主席：

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，以選出第八屆立法會共90名議員。立法會選舉直接關係到「一國兩制」行穩致遠和香港特別行政區（特區）良政善治，長治久安，因此，特區政府極為重視。

就陳勇議員的各項提問，經諮詢公務員事務局，現綜合回覆如下：

目前，立法會換屆選舉的籌備工作正進行得如火如荼。選舉事務處積極進行各方面工作，包括部署選務人手安排、為選舉工作人員安排培訓及演練、為選舉資訊科技系統進行多輪測試、設置投票站、制訂保安及應變計劃等，以確保選舉在公平、公正、誠實、安全有序、高效和人性化的情況下順利舉行。

選舉提名期將於十月二十四日展開並至十一月六日結束。選舉事務處已準備就緒，為接受和處理提名表格作出妥善安排。待候選人資格審查委員會確認候選人資格後，選舉事務處會為候選人舉行簡介會，講解投票及點票安排。選舉事務處將會在十一月底前向選民及獲授權代表發送投票通知卡和候選人簡介等相關資料，通知他們應前往投票的投票站，以及讓選民對有關的候選人有更多認識。

為便利選民投票及提升其投票體驗，選舉事務處會繼續提供合併投票安排，讓選民可在同一投票站投下所有選票。一般而言，選舉事務處會編配選民在其選區並鄰近其登記住址的投票站投票。其他便利投票的措施包括：

（一）選舉事務處會設立鄰近邊境投票站，以便利投票日須往返内地的選民投票並為選擇這些投票站的選民進行預先登記；

（二）除了投票通知卡，選民可登入「選民資料網上查閱系統」檢視自己的登記詳情、獲編配的投票站及地圖、候選人簡介等資料；

（三）設立特別隊伍，讓有需要人士（即年滿70歲或以上人士、孕婦及因身體狀況而難以長時間站立排隊的人士）優先領取選票，並在投票站內設立座位區，供他們輪候時休息；以及

（四）超過九成的投票站將會設於無障礙場地，行動不便或需使用輪椅的選民若獲編配的投票站不方便他們進出，他們可在投票日前五天或之前向選舉事務處提出申請，重新編配到同一地方選區另一個設於無障礙場地的投票站。選舉事務處亦會按他們的需要協助聯絡香港復康會安排復康巴士接載他們往返投票站。

特區政府不斷致力優化選舉的各項流程安排。我們根據實際情況和需要，全盤考慮科技應用、效率提升、安全穩妥、私隱保障和公眾觀感等因素，引入更多資訊科技和智能技術。選舉事務處將：

（一）在功能界別選舉引入電子點票系統輔助點票，以達致提速、提效，以及長遠減省人手的目標；

（二）提升「選民資料網上查閱系統」以支援選民透過「智方便」登入系統，查閱獲編配的投票站及地圖、候選人簡介等資料；

（三）把大部分選舉相關表格電子化，即候選人可選擇使用電子填寫的功能，及透過網上平台提交，例如授權／委任各類代理人的選舉表格、與選舉廣告有關的選舉表格；以及

（四）新增以快速支付系統「轉數快」繳交選舉按金的選擇，候選人也可繼續使用現金、銀行本票及支票支付。

政府正以多元及多渠道方式廣泛宣傳選舉，增強市民對選舉的認知，以鼓勵他們踴躍投票。具體的宣傳活動包括舉辦社區互動活動（如巡迴展覽、攤位遊戲等）、懸掛戶外及交通廣告（如大廈外牆及街道張貼大型戶外廣告、港鐵巴士燈箱廣告等）、運用傳統及社交媒體宣傳（如電台電視及Facebook和Instagram等），以及其他大型重點活動如研討會及綜合晚會等。此外，政府亦會以創新且貼地的形式走進社區，例如在全港多處設置選舉吉祥物「票箱家族」的裝置，並結合擴增實境（AR）及虛擬實境（VR）技術，邀請市民互動體驗、拍照並上傳至社交媒體。同時，政府亦會將選舉與全國運動會的宣傳工作相互配合，以產生協同宣傳效果。

公務員是特區政府治理體系中的重要部分，肩負貫徹落實「一國兩制」和支持特區政府施政的責任。公務員應以身作則行使公民責任投票，在社會上起帶頭作用。選舉的工作由籌備、投票至點票環節，都涉及大量公務員一起參與，同心協力做好每一項工作。在二○二三年區議會一般選舉期間，特區政府透過不同的宣傳方式，例如向公務員發信、向部門辦公室派發宣傳單張、於社交平台發帖文／短片、走訪社區活動等，呼籲全體公務員，以至全港選民積極參與投票。有關安排都十分成功，並獲得公務員及市民的熱烈響應。特區政府在今次立法會換屆選舉中會繼續運用多元化、全方位的形式，積極做好各項宣傳推廣工作，推動公務員投入選舉。就投票日當天上班的人員，部門的主管人員必須容許需要投票的同事離開工作崗位到所屬票站投票，並為此訂定時間表，讓他們有序地前往投票，時間表亦須呈交有關部門首長，同事可申請發還往返辦公室和其所屬票站的交通（包括的士）費用。"
LCQ11: 2025 Legislative Council General Election,2025-10-15 12:03,2025-10-15 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500278.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yung and a written reply by the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  Regarding the 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE), will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the preparations for the 2025 LCGE, including the key stages of work, current progress and subsequent material junctures;

(2) of the specific new measures the Government has put in place to promote the 2025 LCGE, and of the progress of preparation and expected outcomes of the relevant publicity work;

(3) of the measures the Government has put in place to provide further convenience to electors, so as to enhance their voting desire and improve their voting experience;

(4) in respect of the application of technologies, whether the Government has plans to introduce more technology initiatives in public elections to further improve electoral processes and efficiency; if so, of the current progress of the study on this front; and

(5) given that during the 2023 District Council Ordinary Election, the Government had encouraged civil servants to duly fulfil their civic responsibilities and vote on polling day through various activities, how the Government will further encourage civil servants to actively participate in voting during the 2025 LCGE so as to set a good example in society?

Reply:

President,

  The 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE) will be held on December 7 to return 90 members of the eighth term Legislative Council (LegCo). The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government attaches great importance to the LegCo election as it is directly related to the steadfast and successful implementation of ""one country, two systems"" and to the good governance and long-term stability of the HKSAR.

  Having consulted the Civil Service Bureau, a consolidated reply in response to the various questions raised by the Hon Chan Yung is as follows:

  The preparations for the LCGE are currently in full swing. The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) is actively undertaking a wide range of tasks, including the deployment of electoral staff, provision of training and drills for electoral staff, conduct of multiple rounds of testing for election information technology systems, set up polling stations, formulation of security and contingency plans, to ensure that the election will be smoothly conducted in a fair, just, honest, safe and orderly, efficient and user-friendly manner.

  The nomination period will run from October 24 to November 6. The REO had made appropriate arrangements and is ready to receive and process nomination forms. Upon the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee's confirmation of the eligibility of candidates, the REO will hold a briefing session for candidates to explain the polling and counting arrangements. The REO will send poll cards, Introduction to Candidates and related materials to electors and authorised representatives before the end of November, with a view to notifying them of their assigned polling station for casting their votes and enabling electors to gain a better understanding of the candidates concerned.

  To facilitate electors in casting their votes and enhance their voting experience, the REO will continue adopting the combined voting arrangement to allow electors to cast all their votes at the same polling station. In general, the REO will assign electors to vote at the polling station within their constituency and close to their registered residential address. Other facilitation measures for voting include:

(i) the REO will set up Near Boundary Polling Stations to facilitate electors who need to travel to and from the Mainland on the polling day. Prior registration will be made for electors who choose to vote at these polling stations;

(ii)besides the poll card, electors may access the Online Voter Information Enquiry System (OVIES) to view their registration details, assigned polling station and location map, and Introduction to Candidates, etc.;

(iii)a special queue will be set up for individuals in need (viz. persons aged 70 or above, pregnant women, and persons who are unable to queue for a long time due to physical conditions), who will have priority to obtain their ballot papers. A seating area will also be provided in the polling station for these electors to take rest while waiting; and

(iv)over 90 per cent of polling stations will be set up at venues with barrier-free access. If electors who have mobility difficulties or need to use wheelchair are allocated to inaccessible polling stations, they may apply to the REO at least five days before the polling day for re-allocation to a polling station set up at an accessible venue within the same geographical constituency. Where necessary, the REO will also assist in contacting the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation for arranging Rehabuses to transport them to and from polling stations.

  The HKSAR Government has been striving to enhance the various electoral procedures and arrangements. We will, in light of the actual circumstances and needs, take holistic consideration of such factors as the application of technology, enhancement of efficiency, safety and security, privacy protection and public perception, etc, in introducing the wider use of information and smart technologies. The REO will:

(i)introduce the electronic counting system for the functional constituency election to facilitate vote counting, with a view to enhancing the speed, efficiency and achieving the target to reduce manpower in the long run;

(ii)upgrade the OVIES to support electors'login via ""iAM Smart"" for viewing their assigned polling station and its location map, Introduction to Candidates, etc;

(iii)digitalise most election-related forms, which allows candidates to use the electronic filling function and submit through the online platform, such as electoral forms for authorising/appointing various types of agents and forms relating to election advertisements; and

(iv)provide a new option of paying election deposits via the Faster Payment System, while candidates may continue to use cash, cashier's order or cheque for payment.

  The Government is promoting the election through diverse activities and channels to enhance the public's understanding of the election and encourage them to vote actively. Specific promotional activities include organising community interactive activities (such as roving exhibitions and game booths, etc), placing outdoor and transport advertisements (such as large outdoor advertisements on external walls of buildings and streets, as well as MTR and bus lightbox advertising, etc), launching promotion through traditional and social media platforms (such as radio, television, Facebook and Instagram, etc), and conducting other large-scale events such as a seminar and variety show, etc. In addition, the Government is reaching out to the community with a novel and down-to-earth approach. For example, the installation of the election mascots Ballot Box Family at various locations across the territory is combined with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies to invite the public to interact, take photos and upload them to the social media. At the same time, the Government will co-ordinate the promotional efforts for the election and the National Games to create synergetic publicity effect.

  As a key component of the HKSAR Government's governance system, civil servants shoulder the responsibility of fully implementing ""one country, two systems"" and supporting the governance of the HKSAR Government. Civil servants should take the lead in society and set an example by fulfilling their civic responsibility to vote. A large number of civil servants have been engaged in election-related work, from preparation, polling to counting, who have made concerted efforts to ensure the smooth completion of every task. During the 2023District Council Ordinary Election, the HKSAR Government appealed to all civil servants as well as electors in Hong Kong to actively cast their votes through various publicity channels, such as writing to civil servants, distributing promotional leaflets to departmental offices, publishing posts/videos on social media platforms, holding events to reach out to the community, etc. The related arrangements were very successful and received overwhelming response from civil servants and the public. For the upcoming LCGE, the HKSAR Government will continue to employ diverse and comprehensive means to proactively optimise various publicity and promotional initiatives, with a view to encouraging civil servants to participate in the election. As for staff who are required to work on the polling day, departmental managers must release those who need to vote to cast their votes at their designated polling stations. Timetables should be prepared accordingly to facilitate staff to leave the office for voting in an orderly manner. Also, such timetables must be submitted to the Heads of Departments concerned. Colleagues may apply for reimbursement of transport (including taxi) fares for travelling between their offices and designated polling stations."

立法會八題：​南港島線（西段）項目,2025-10-15 11:30,2025-10-15 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500188.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上邱達根議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於去年十二月公布將會採用智慧綠色集體運輸系統推展南港島線（西段），替代原有重型鐵路方案，並計劃在今年內開展詳細規劃及設計，目標爭取在二○二七年開展前期建造工程。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）南港島線（西段）項目的規劃及設計工作的最新進展為何，以及何時公布整項工程的具體詳情，包括預計的動工及竣工日期，以及涉及的人手及開支等；

（二）就在南港島線（西段）引入中國內地或海外採用的智慧綠色集體運輸系統、先進技術和管理模式，政府曾經進行哪些相關的可行性研究，以及該等研究的結果為何；政府是否已基於研究結果得出初步的傾向性取態和決定；及

（三）鑑於根據政府資料，南港島線（西段）將途經數碼港及香港大學等創科發展的核心區域和院校，為促進本港創科的可持續發展，政府有否全面檢視該項目的施工計劃及時間表，以令其可盡快上馬和落成通車；若有，詳情為何（包括整個項目如何分階段進行、有哪些工序可精簡和壓縮、相關工程造價、預計最早通車時間，以及其他可令工程提速、提效的具體措施）？

答覆：

主席：

南港島線（西段）初步走線全長約7.5公里，途經香港仔、華富、數碼港、瑪麗醫院及薄扶林一帶，為香港島的西部及南部地區提供便捷的接駁交通服務，便利市民前往港鐵南港島線黃竹坑站和港島線香港大學站。就提問各部分，經諮詢路政署，現回覆如下：

（一）我們一直積極推展南港島線（西段）的規劃工作，並於去年十二月及今年一月先後向立法會鐵路事宜小組委員會及南區區議會匯報項目的最新進展。我們正繼續評估項目的財務安排，包括進一步優化走線以及提高成本效益，以期今年內開展項目詳細規劃及設計，並爭取於二○二七年開展前期建造工程。我們的目標是在今年內公布項目的最新推展時間表。

當詳細規劃及設計階段開展後，我們會就項目進行法定環境影響評估，以及評估項目在建造期間及建成後對其他道路使用者的交通影響。我們亦會與不同持份者溝通，聽取意見，並敲定建議方案的細節（包括系統設計、造價、財務安排、管理模式等）。

（二）根據政府就不同智慧綠色集體運輸系統項目進行的研究和系統供應商及營運商提供的資訊，智慧綠色集體運輸系統為中低運量系統。相比重型鐵路系統，智慧綠色集體運輸系統體積較小，主要採用膠轆行駛，特點是輕巧、爬坡能力強，所引致的噪音及景觀影響會相對較少，加上系統一般不需要架空電纜等設施，機電支援系統及維修保養工程相對簡單。這類系統適合在上坡、已發展及空間有限的地區行駛，普遍能夠避免深入地底，減少乘客往返地面的時間，預期能夠提高運輸效益。南港島線（西段）項目採用的智慧綠色集體運輸系統將會在詳細規劃及設計階段，經參考各種先進系統技術和營運模式後敲定。

（三）我們一直與其他政府部門和機構緊密協調，務求南港島線（西段）項目能夠妥善銜接香港大學、數碼港及沿線其他設施，並盡量配合相關發展。正如回覆第一部分所述，項目建議方案的細節會在詳細規劃及設計階段敲定。我們會積極考慮採取各種創新技術，如組裝合成法，盡量壓縮推展時間，以盡快落成通車。我們亦會繼續審視並研究其他提速提效的方法，包括加快審批流程等，力爭早日完工。"

問題：

據報不少市民喜歡獨自遠足，但近年涉及獨自遠足人士的意外時有發生。有意見認為，獨自遠足人士在發生意外後往往未能及時報警求助，延誤了搜救行動，同時在沒有同伴提醒下，容易低估了山徑路線風險或高估自己的體能，導致意外發生。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年涉及獨自遠足人士的求助個案數目為何；該等求助個案的傷亡人數，以及有關搜救行動所涉及的政府開支為何；

（二）有否研究過去三年遠足意外的主要成因；有否統計，該等意外中獨自遠足人士和結伴遠足人士的比例，以及兩者在搜索及拯救難度和時間上的差異為何；及

（三）會否加強宣傳，鼓勵結伴遠足，並將險要路段定為「獨自遠足人士意外黑點」，以提醒遠足人士切勿獨自前往？

消防處沒有備存涉及獨自遠足人士的求助個案數字。由於上述拯救行動不涉及額外人力資源及薪酬開支，消防處沒有備存所涉開支的分項數字。

（二）及（三）遠足意外的成因及性質複雜多樣，除地勢和環境因素外，亦包括天氣變化、迷路和其他個人原因等。就攀山拯救事故的數字，政府沒有備存有關獨自與結伴遠足的比例，以及兩者在搜索及拯救時間上差異的分項數字。然而，獨自遠足相比結伴遠足是會增加安全風險，以及發生意外時救援的困難。政府一直從不同途徑呼籲遠足人士切勿獨自遠足，並應結伴同行，包括在漁農自然護理署「郊野樂行」專頁（www.hiking.gov.hk）發放相關訊息、制作網上短片、在社交媒體不時發文提示等，亦於遠足旺季，聯同其他相關政府部門加強相關宣傳教育。

此外，我們持續鼓勵遠足人士下載與緊急救援相關的手機應用程式（如「郊野樂行遠足留蹤」流動應用程式、HKSOS等），提升遠足人士的安全意識和在意外發生後的搜救效率。「郊野樂行」專頁亦提供不同遠足路徑的綜合資訊，包括路徑的長短、難度、配套等，讓遊人因應自身情況妥善規劃適合自身的行程；以及根據過去發生嚴重或致命意外的地點、相關個案的意外成因、現場地勢等因素，列出郊野公園曾發生致命及嚴重意外的高危地點，提醒遠足人士避免前往，並會定期檢視及按需要更新高危地點的名單。"

Question:

The Government announced in December last year that it would adopt Smart and Green Mass Transit System (SGMTS) to take forward the South Island Line (West) (SIL(W)) as an alternative to the original heavy rail scheme. Detailed planning and design are scheduled to begin within this year, with the aim of striving to start the preliminary construction work in 2027. In ‍this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest progress of the planning and design work for the SIL(W) project, and the expected announcement date for the specific details of the entire project, including the estimated start and completion dates, as well as manpower and expenditure involved;

(2) regarding the introduction of SGMTS, advanced technologies and management models adopted in the Chinese Mainland or overseas for the SIL(W) project, of the relevant feasibility studies that have been conducted by the Government and the findings of these studies; whether the Government has reached preliminary inclination or decision based on the study findings; and

(3) given that, according to Government information, SIL(W) will pass through core innovation and technology development areas and institutions, such as Cyberport and the University of Hong Kong, whether the Government has holistically reviewed the project's construction plan and timetable to facilitate its early commencement and completion, with a view to promoting the sustainable development of innovation and technology in Hong Kong; if so, of the details (including how the entire project will be carried out in phases, which work procedures can be streamlined and compressed, the relevant construction costs, the earliest expected commissioning date, and other specific measures to enhance speed and efficiency of the project)?

Reply:

President,

The preliminary alignment of the South Island Line (West) (SIL(W)) is about 7.5-kilometre long, passing through areas around Aberdeen, Wah Fu, Cyberport, Queen Mary Hospital and Pok Fu Lam. It will provide a convenient feeder services connecting the western and southern parts of Hong Kong Island and facilitate the public to go to the MTR Wong Chuk Hang Station of the South Island Line and HKU Station of the Island Line. Having consulted the Highways Department, the reply to the respective parts of the question is as follows:

(1) We have been actively taking forward the planning work of the SIL(W) and updated the Legislative Council Subcommittee on Matters Relating to Railways and the Southern District Council on the latest development of the project in December last year and January this year respectively. We are continuing to evaluate the project's financial arrangements, including further optimising the alignment and improving cost-effectiveness, with a view to commencing the detailed planning and design of the project within this year and striving to commence the advance construction works in 2027. We target to announce the latest implementation programme of the project this year.

Once the detailed planning and design stage has commenced, we will conduct the statutory environmental impact assessment for the project and assess its traffic impact on other road users during and after construction. We will also engage various stakeholders, gather their feedback, and finalise the details of the proposed scheme (including the design of the system, cost, financial arrangements and management mode).

(2) With reference to the studies by the Government on different Smart and Green Mass Transit System (SGMTS) projects and the information obtained from the system suppliers and operators, SGMTS is a medium-to-low capacity system. Compared to the heavy rail system, SGMTS is smaller in size and mainly runs on rubber tyres. Characterised by its lightweight and strong climbing capability, it would induce less noise and visual impacts. Furthermore, the system generally does not require the installation of overhead lines, and its electrical and mechanical support systems and maintenance works are relatively simpler. This type of system is suitable for operating in hilly, developed and congested areas. It can generally avoid running deep underground and reduce the time of passengers traveling to and from the ground level, and is expected to enhance the transport benefits. The SGMTS to be adopted in the SIL(W) project will be determined in the detailed planning and design stage, upon taking into account advanced technologies and operating modes of different systems.

(3) We have been co-ordinating closely with other government departments and organisations for smooth interfaces of the SIL(W) project with the University of Hong Kong, Cyberport and other facilities along the alignment and for facilitating related developments as much as possible. As mentioned in Part (1) of the reply, the details of the proposed scheme of the project will be finalised during the detailed planning and design stage. We will actively consider adopting different innovative technologies, such as the use of Modular Integrated Construction (MiC), to compress the implementation programme as much as possible for the commissioning of the project at the earliest. We will also continue to explore and review other methods to enhance the speed as well as efficiency, including expediting the approval process, to strive for early completion of the project."
LCQ7: Safety of hikers,2025-10-15 11:30,2025-10-15 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500243.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

 It has been reported that quite a number of members of the public like hiking alone, but accidents involving lone hikers have occurred from time to time in recent years. There are views that lone hikers are often unable to report to the Police for assistance promptly after accidents, causing delays in search and rescue (S&R) operations, and in the absence of reminders from companions, they are susceptible to underestimating trail risks or overestimating their physical fitness, thus resulting in accidents. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of requests for assistance involving lone hikers in the past three years; the number of casualties in such cases requesting assistance, and the Government expenditures involved in the relevant S&R operations;

(2) whether it has studied the main causes of hiking accidents in the past three years; whether it has compiled statistics on the proportion of lone hikers and group hikers in such accidents, and the differences in the difficulty and duration of search and rescue between the two; and

(3) whether it will step up publicity to encourage hiking in groups, and classify dangerous paths as ""accident black spots for lone hikers"" to alert hikers not to go there alone?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Security Bureau, the reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing is as follow:

(1) In the past three years, the number of mountain search and rescue calls received by the Fire Services Department (FSD) and the number of casualties involved are tabulated below:




Year
Number of mountain search and rescue calls received
Number of Injuries (Fatalities)


2022
1 014 cases
589 (20)


2023
695 cases
424 (15)


2024
588 cases
345 (15)




 The FSD does not maintain statistics on the number of cases of lone hikers seeking assistance. As the above rescue operations did not involve additional manpower and salary expenditure, the FSD does not keep a breakdown of the expenditure involved.

(2) and (3) The causes and nature of hiking accidents are complex and varied, apart from factors of terrain and environment, they also include changes in weather, hikers getting lost, and other personal reasons of hikers. Regarding the number of mountain rescue cases, the Government does not have the breakdown of the cases by the proportion of hiking alone versus hiking with others, nor the figure of the difference in the time used for search and rescue operations between those two kinds of hikers. However, hiking alone will have higher safety risks than hiking with others, and poses greater difficulty on search and rescue when accidents occur. The Government has been urging the public to hike with others instead of hiking alone through various channels, including disseminating relevant information through the ""Enjoy Hiking"" website (www.hiking.gov.hk) of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, producing online videos, and regular publishing reminder posts on social media platform, etc. The AFCD also collaborates with other relevant departments to enhance relevant promotion and education during hiking season.

 Moreover, we continuously encourage hikers to download mobile applications relevant to emergency rescue (such as ""Enjoy Hiking Hiker Tracking Service"" mobile application, HKSOS, etc.), to raise the hikers' awareness of hiking safety, and enhance efficiency of rescue operations when accidents occur. The ""Enjoy Hiking"" website provides comprehensive information on various hiking trails, including trail length, overall difficulty, nearby facilities, for hikers to plan hiking trips that are suitable for themselves according their personal conditions. The website also lists out high risk locations with records of fatal and serious accidents in country parks, which are formulated based on previous records of serious and fatal accidents, causes of such accidents, as well as site conditions, with a view to reminding hikers to avoid visiting those areas. The list will be regularly reviewed and updated as appropriate."
立法會十八題：保護兒童的相關法例,2025-10-15 11:05,2025-10-15 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500213.htm,"以下是今日（十月十五日）在立法會會議上陳家珮議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，保障兒童的安全及福祉極為重要，但本港保護兒童的相關法例的尺度及所訂的兒童年齡上限並不統一，有需要作出檢討。例如在《僱用兒童規例》（第57B章）下，年滿13歲及15歲者分別可受僱於非工業機構和受僱於工業工作；在《婚姻條例》（第181章）下，年滿16歲者可在提交父母或監護人的書面同意書後結婚；而在《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27條下，有關「對所看管兒童或少年人虐待或忽略」罪行所訂的兒童年齡上限則為16歲，家長獨留不足16歲兒童在家便可能觸犯法例。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年因觸犯第212章第27條而遭定罪的人數，以及當中涉及獨留兒童在家的個案數目為何；

（二）據悉有學校向家長表示，小學三年級或以上的學生已可無須家長接送並自行往返學校，當局是否知悉有關情況，以及有否就第212章的相關法例規定向學校作出清晰指引，以防範意外發生；

（三）有否計劃全面檢討保護兒童安全的相關法例，以統一標準及更好地保障兒童的福祉；及

（四）鑑於行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布會優化在校課後託管服務計劃，取消名額上限以擴大支援有需要的小學生和家長，但有意見指出該計劃只涵蓋小學生，按現時第212章第27條的規定，意味育有12歲至16歲以下兒童的家長仍難以外出工作，政府有否政策措施協助該等家長，以鼓勵生育及釋放勞動力？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來採取多管齊下的策略保護兒童，令他們免受傷害或虐待。政府除了及早識別和介入虐待兒童個案以保護兒童，亦會支援有虐兒風險的家庭從源頭上預防虐待兒童。就議員的提問，經徵詢保安局及教育局，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二五年上半年，因干犯《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27條，即虐待或忽略所看管的兒童或少年人，被定罪的人數見附件。政府沒有備存其中涉及獨留兒童在家的個案數目。

（二）及（四）《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）第27條規定，任何超過16歲的人如故意襲擊、虐待、忽略、拋棄或遺棄由他所管養、看管或照顧的16歲或以下的兒童或少年人，而相當可能導致其受到不必要的苦楚或健康損害，即屬犯罪。

具體而言，容許兒童自行往返學校或獨留兒童在家會否觸犯上述條例取決於多方面因素，並視乎個別案情而定，例如該兒童的實際年齡和自我照顧能力，有關行為是否對兒童構成傷害、涉案人士是否有照顧責任、是否有意圖疏忽照顧該兒童及是否知悉其行為可能會對該兒童構成傷害等，不能一概而論。

就學童往返學校的方式，教育局十分重視學生的安全，並一直與學校攜手合作，致力為學生締造安全的環境。教育局已為學校編訂《學校行政手冊》和「學生安全及健康措施一覽表」，支援學校履行其職責，提升學生安全及健康管理。現時，小學普遍已訂定校本政策安排學生安全有序往返學校，包括校車服務、放學隊、家長接送等候區等。如有家長選擇讓其子女自行往返學校，應考慮其居住地點與學校的距離、子女的自理能力等；與此同時，學校亦應教導學生交通安全知識，包括時刻遵守交通規則，透過家校合作促進學生有效學習和健康成長。

就在校課後託管服務計劃（計劃），政府在二○二三／二四學年推行計劃，讓有需要的小學生可在課後留校，在安全熟悉的環境下接受託管及學習支援，方便家長外出工作，雙職及單親家庭亦可受惠。政府在二○二五／二六學年進一步優化計劃，取消名額上限，擴大支援有需要的小學生和家長。中學生踏入青少年階段，自理能力一般較高，服務需要與小學生不相同，家長需要的支援也不相同。全港有139間綜合青少年服務中心提供全面及多元化的服務，包括指導和輔導、支援計劃、發展和社交活動，以及社區參與活動，讓青少年在課餘時間充實及增值自我。

（三）現行多條法例保護兒童免受不同種類的傷害，包括《僱用兒童規例》（第57B章）、《婚姻條例》（第181章）、《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）、《侵害人身罪條例》（第212章）、《保護兒童及少年條例》（第213章）、《防止兒童色情物品條例》（第579章）、及將在明年一月二十日生效的《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》（第650章）等。政府會繼續確保各法例的實施妥善到位，並會適時監察成效，考慮如何進一步加強保護兒童的工作，包括在有實際需要時檢討各保護兒童的相關法例。"
LCQ18: Legislation related to protecting children,2025-10-15 11:05,2025-10-15 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101500220.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Judy Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 15):

Question:

  There are views that safeguarding children's safety and well-being is of paramount importance, but as the scope of Hong Kong's legislation related to protecting children and the age ceilings for children stipulated therein are inconsistent, a review is warranted. For example, under the Employment of Children Regulations (Cap. 57B), persons who have attained 13 and 15 years may be employed in non-industrial establishments and in industrial work respectively; under the Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181), persons who have attained 16 years may marry upon production of written consent from their parents or guardians; while under section 27 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), the age ceiling for children stipulated in respect of the offence of ""ill-treatment or neglect by those in charge of child or young person"" is 16, and parents may breach the law by leaving children aged below 16 unattended at home. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of persons convicted for contravening section 27 of Cap. 212 in each of the past five years, and among them, the number of cases involving leaving children unattended at home;

(2) as it is learnt that some schools have informed parents that students in primary three or above may travel to and from school by themselves without parental escort, whether the authorities know about this situation, and whether clear guidelines regarding the requirements of relevant legislative provisions under Cap. 212 are issued to schools, with a view to preventing the occurrence of accidents;

(3) whether it has plans to comprehensively review the legislation related to safeguarding children's safety, with a view to standardising the standards and better safeguarding the well-being of children; and

(4) as the Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the School-based After School Care Service Scheme would be enhanced by uncapping the number of places to expand support for primary students and parents in need, but there are views pointing out that the scheme only covers primary students, and under the existing provisions of section 27 of Cap. 212, it implies that parents with children aged 12 to below 16 still face difficulties in going out to work, whether the Government has policy initiatives in place to assist such parents, so as to encourage childbearing and unleash the labour force?

Reply:

President,

  The Government has been adopting a multi-pronged strategy to protect children from harm or abuse. Apart from identifying and intervening in child abuse cases at an early stage to protect children, the Government also supports families at risk of child abuse to prevent child abuse at source. The consolidated reply to the Member's question, in consultation with the Security Bureau and the Education Bureau (EDB), is as follows:

(1) The number of persons convicted of an offence under section 27 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), i.e. ill-treatment or neglect by those in charge of child or young person, from 2020 to the first half of 2025 is set out in the Annex. The Government does not compile statistics on the number of these cases involving leaving children unattended at home.

(2) and (4) Section 27 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212) stipulates that any person over the age of 16 years who wilfully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, abandons or exposes such child or young person under the age of 16 years under his custody, charge or care in a manner likely to cause such child or young person unnecessary suffering or injury to his health shall be guilty of a criminal offence.

Specifically, whether allowing a child to travel to and from school by themselves or leaving a child unattended at home would constitute an offence under the above legislation depends on a number of factors and has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, including the child's age and self-care abilities, whether the act has caused harm to the child, whether the person involved has a responsibility of care over the child, and whether the person has intentionally neglected the child and is aware of the possible harm to the child caused by his act, and cannot be generalised.

Regarding the ways students commute between homes and schools, the EDB attaches great importance to students' safety and has been working with schools to create a safe environment for students. The EDB has compiled the School Administration Guide and the ""Checklist of Student Safety and Health Measures"" to support schools in fulfilling their responsibilities and enhancing student safety and health management. Currently, primary schools generally have established school-based policies to ensure the safe and orderly transportation of students, including school bus services, returning-home teams, and designated parent drop-off/pick-up areas. If parents choose to have their children travel to and from the school independently, they should consider the distance from their residence to the school and their children's ability to manage themselves. Schools should also teach students about road safety, including the importance of always obeying traffic rules, to foster effective learning and healthy development of students through home-school co-operation.

In respect of the School-based After School Care Service Scheme (the Scheme), the Government launched the Scheme in the 2023/24 school year, with a view to allowing primary students in need to stay after school to receive care and learning support in a safe and familiar environment, and enabling parents to take up jobs. Both dual-income families and single-parent families will be benefitted. In the 2025/26 school year, the Scheme is further enhanced by uncapping the number of service places to expand support for primary students and parents in need. As secondary school students enter adolescence, their self-care abilities are generally higher. Their service needs become different from those of primary school students, and the support required by their parents is also different. There are 139 Integrated Children and Youth Services Centres in Hong Kong, providing comprehensive and diversified services, including guidance and counselling, supportive programmes, developmental and socialisation programmes, and community engagement programmes, which enable youths to enrich and enhance themselves during leisure time.

(3) At present, there are many pieces of legislation in place that protect children from different kinds of harm, including the Employment of Children Regulations (Cap. 57B), the Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181), the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200), the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), the Protection of Children and Juveniles Ordinance (Cap. 213), the Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance (Cap. 579), and the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance (Cap. 650) which will be effective from January 20, 2026. The Government will continue to ensure the proper and solid implementation of these pieces of legislation, and will suitably monitor their effectiveness and consider how to further strengthen child protection, including reviewing the relevant child protection legislation when there is an actual need."

AFCD urges grave sweepers to prevent hill fires,2025-10-15 11:00,2025-10-15 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/15/P2025101400228.htm,"The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) today (October 15) reminded people paying tribute to ancestors at graveyards in the countryside during the Chung Yeung Festival period to exercise caution and prevent hill fires.

An AFCD spokesman said it is an offence under the Forests and Countryside Ordinance (Cap. 96) to leave behind kindling or burn offerings without considering fire risks in the countryside. Any person who contravenes the ordinance may be prosecuted and is liable to a maximum fine of $25,000 and one year's imprisonment upon conviction.

AFCD staff will step up patrols at graveyards in the countryside during the Chung Yeung Festival period and take enforcement action against any irregularities.

The majority of hill fires in the countryside are caused by human negligence. Accidents can be prevented if grave sweepers observe some simple guidelines:

* Remove weeds around graves with tools and never burn weeds;
* Burning should only be done inside a container or iron bucket;
* Never leave burning offerings unattended; and
* Make sure all kindling is put out before leaving.

The spokesman said that metal containers for burning offerings properly will be handed out to grave sweepers who have such a need at suitable locations in country parks during the Chung Yeung Festival. The AFCD will also patrol hill fire black spots and distribute hill fire prevention leaflets together with the Fire Services Department and the Civil Aid Service.

Members of the public are reminded to keep the countryside clean and properly clean up their offerings or rubbish."

Upon arrival, he attended the annual Gala Dinner of the National Committee on United States-China Relations (NCUSCR) and met with the NCUSCR Chair and former US Trade Representative, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky. During their meeting, they exchanged views on current China-US economic and trade relations, as well as issues relating to trade, investment and financial markets between Hong Kong and the US. Mr Chan also briefed Ambassador Barshefsky on the latest developments in Hong Kong.

During the meeting, Mr Chan expressed his pleasure at having the opportunity to visit the US again and engage in face-to-face exchanges with leaders from the American political, business and academic communities, with a view to briefing them on the latest developments of Hong Kong. He noted the strong and close economic and trade ties between Hong Kong and the US. Despite the significant uncertainties currently facing the global economy, under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong will continue to maintain its status as a free port, uphold the common law system and rule of law, sustain a simple and low tax regime, and implement open, stable and predictable economic and trade policies. Hong Kong continues to welcome US businesses to invest and expand their presence in the city. Mr Chan recognised the important and active role the NCUSCR has long played in promoting Hong Kong-US economic and trade relations and expressed hope for continued close co-operation with the Committee to create more opportunities for the business communities of both places.

The Gala Dinner is a major annual event organised by the NCUSCR, bringing together prominent political, business and academic leaders from both China and the US, with a view to facilitating exchanges and co-operation between the two countries.

文化體育及旅遊局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-10-14 23:22,2025-10-15 00:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400936.htm,"​以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（十月十四日）出席2027亞洲足協亞洲盃外圍賽第三輪——中國香港對孟加拉後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：現在心情如何？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：（中國香港隊）贏不到當然有少許可惜，不過我們頂得住1比1都是開心的。我很開心見到我們香港隊今日全部球員很拼搏，打出了我們中國香港隊應有的精神，還有數名球員全場沒有停過，（例如）茹子楠、14號劉家喬、陳晉一等真的沒有停過。我想我們盡了力，亦拿到一分，希望可以在接下來下一場主場取勝。我亦很感謝球迷沒有停過打氣，我也聲沙，他們可以喊了數小時還這麼好力氣，完全繼續為我們港隊主場打氣，很感謝他們。我也很開心有一場很好的比賽讓大家觀賞到。

記者：有這麼好的球迷、這麼好的球員，是否可以將啟德主場館定為港足（中國香港足球隊）真主場？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：足總（中國香港足球總會）一直與啟德體育園商討，我們會盡量希望可以達成一個雙方都合理、雙方都有利的協議。政府亦會繼續支持中國香港隊和香港足球，包括港超聯（香港超級聯賽）。事實上，球場一直是個問題。康文署（康樂及文化事務署）過往每年大約預留127節供港超（聯球隊）作為主場或使用草地練習，今年已增加到252節。另外，以前康文署場地對於打氣，例如用鼓、擴音器有較多限制。現在大家都看到，球迷入場除了看場好賽事外，他們也很享受氣氛，我們也覺得這樣是很好的，我們也鼓勵球迷多點幫我們的球隊打氣，所以這個月（相關限制）又放寬了。接下來我們會繼續支持香港足球，也希望我們中國香港隊下一場在主場對新加坡時可以大獲全勝，那我們就很有機會出線了。

記者：剛才最緊張是哪個環節？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：我們幾乎可以2比0的，那球「笠射」我想只差一點而已。另外我們有球員被趕出場，兩黃一紅，心是沉一沉的，不過足球就是這樣。

記者：見到這樣好的球迷，有甚麼說話想對球迷和球員說？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：多謝球迷，還有請他們介紹我吃甚麼喉糖可以不聲沙的，多謝各位。"
​第十五屆全國運動會自行車（公路）賽（男子個人賽）安排（附圖／短片）,2025-10-14 22:30,2025-10-14 23:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400867.htm,"第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）自行車（公路）賽（男子個人賽）將於十一月八日舉行。全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室（全運會統籌辦）主任楊德強今日（十月十四日）聯同相關政府部門和中國香港單車總會代表舉行記者會，介紹賽事內容，以及臨時交通管制措施、口岸通關、應急救援及其他賽事相關安排。

今年的自行車（公路）賽（男子個人賽）是十五運會唯一橫跨粵港澳三個賽區的賽事，三地在去年十一月曾舉行測試賽，九月三十日亦進行了賽前綜合演練，過程大致順利。正式賽事賽道全程231.8公里，其中香港賽段為55.8公里，途經港珠澳大橋，然後前往香港口岸人工島、北大嶼山公路和竹篙灣公路，進入香港迪士尼樂園度假區後折返，再經港珠澳大橋前往橫琴，然後返回珠海。

賽事在十一月八日上午九時開始，預計下午二時三十分結束，屆時將有來自內地及港澳25支隊伍共104名運動員競逐獎項。預計車隊在上午約十時二十分進入香港段，並在香港段作賽約一個半小時。

為方便公眾觀賞賽事，香港迪士尼樂園度假區以外的幻想道行人路將設公眾觀賞區，可容納約數百名觀眾，市民可到場觀賽和為運動員打氣。警方會視乎現場情況，適時實施人流管制措施，請市民聽從現場警方及工作人員指示。由於北大嶼山公路的賽道路段將實施臨時交通管制措施，市民應盡量乘搭港鐵到迪士尼站再步行前往指定觀賞區。廣東賽區已委託主廣播機構中央電視台直播相關賽事，所有持權媒體，包括香港三間免費電視台和香港電台，均可取得直播訊號。

為配合賽事進行，當日港珠澳大橋香港口岸、大橋以及部分道路需要實施臨時管控措施，有關安排詳列如下：

（一）通關安排

賽事當日，港珠澳大橋東行由珠海／澳門往香港方向，由上午九時至下午十二時三十分實施臨時管控；而港珠澳大橋西行由香港往珠海／澳門方向，則由上午七時三十分至下午十二時三十分實施臨時管控。臨時管控期間，所有車輛禁止使用大橋，離境的通關服務將有特別安排。若有旅客或車輛計劃於臨時管控措施實施前離港前往珠海或澳門，他們必須於當日早上六時三十分前抵達港珠澳大橋香港口岸旅檢大樓出境大堂或出境車輛通關廣場，以辦理離境及通關手續。香港口岸旅檢大樓出境大堂及出境車輛通關廣場將於上午六時三十分關閉。

港珠澳大橋香港口岸的離境通關服務預計於當日下午十二時三十分後恢復正常運作，屆時預計交通將會較為繁忙，計劃於當日使用大橋的旅客及司機請預早規劃行程，並留意珠海市內交通管制的安排。

（二）公共交通運輸安排

當日港珠澳大橋主橋及香港口岸實施臨時管控期間，經港珠澳大橋來往香港與珠海及澳門的跨境公共運輸服務，包括港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）、跨境直通巴士及香港國際機場海天中轉大樓的客車服務將會暫停。由於珠海市內的道路因比賽仍然封閉直至下午約二時三十分，香港往珠海的金巴介乎下午十二時三十分至一時三十分將提供有限度服務，而珠海往香港的金巴將於下午二時三十分恢復服務。另外，來往香港與澳門之間的金巴將於下午十二時三十分恢復服務。

此外，在實施臨時管控期間，來往港珠澳大橋香港口岸的本地公共運輸服務，包括機場巴士「A」線、接駁巴士路線「B」線及接駁迪士尼樂園的「R」線，將會實施臨時服務調整，當中由機場開出的「A」線由上午十時至下午一時期間暫停途經香港口岸。而由市區及新界前往機場的「A」線會由首班車至上午十一時三十分暫停途經香港口岸。接駁巴士來往港珠澳大橋香港口岸與機場／欣澳站的第B4及B5號線則會於部分時間暫停服務，而接駁迪士尼樂園與青嶼幹線轉車站及屯門站的第R8及R33號線亦會於部分時間暫停服務。另外，為確保賽事順利進行，順朗路（來回方向）將會封閉，詳見下文（三），受影響的巴士路線需臨時改道。巴士公司會張貼通告通知受影響乘客有關服務調整的詳情。

運輸署將通知受影響的跨境及本地公共運輸服務營辦商，海事處亦會聯絡跨境渡輪營運商，以制訂人手及班次安排。在實施臨時管控期間，旅客可使用香港與深圳之間的陸路口岸來往香港與珠海，亦可考慮乘搭跨境渡輪服務來往香港與澳門。

當天上午六時至中午十二時的「港車北上」預約申請將會暫停。視乎當日實際交通管控安排，預約當天下午時段「港車北上」的駕駛人士於臨時管控結束後（預計於下午約十二時三十分後）方可進入香港口岸出境車輛通關廣場。

香港國際機場海天中轉大樓的客車服務方面，當日來往香港國際機場、珠海口岸和澳門口岸的客車服務會在港珠澳大橋香港口岸實施臨時管控期間暫停。香港機場管理局將與各服務營辦商保持緊密聯繫，並根據最新情況檢視及調整安排。

另外，十五運會自行車（公路）賽（女子個人賽）將於十一月九日舉行，雖然比賽路線主要涉及珠海市內，不影響港珠澳大橋及口岸通關服務，但由於賽事關係，珠海市內部分道路將會封閉，在當日上午七時三十分至十一時三十分期間，金巴往珠海只能夠提供有限度服務，建議市民避免在上述時段乘坐金巴前往珠海。此外，香港與珠海九洲港十一月八日和九日部分渡輪航班亦會暫停。

（三）道路管制安排

位於北大嶼山公路及香港迪士尼樂園度假區及附近道路的賽道路段，將於香港段比賽期間實施滾動式臨時交通管制措施（確實時間將視乎賽事的實際進程）。

位於北大嶼山公路的賽道路段當日將實施滾動式臨時交通管制措施，屆時，經北大嶼山公路來往機場的行車時間預計需要增加約30分鐘。計劃往返機場的市民和旅客應預早計劃行程，預留充裕交通時間，盡量使用鐵路服務，包括機場快綫、東涌綫及迪士尼綫，避免駕駛車輛前往有關路段。如出行人士需駕車前往機場，應考慮使用屯門─赤鱲角隧道進出機場。

位於香港迪士尼樂園度假區附近道路的賽道路段，將於賽事進行期間實施臨時交通管制措施。屆時，經竹篙灣公路、欣澳道、神奇道及幻想道來往樂園、酒店及迪欣湖活動中心的行車時間，或因交通管制措施而增加約30分鐘。計劃前往香港迪士尼樂園度假區一帶的市民，應考慮盡量使用鐵路服務。

此外，由於此路段連接北大嶼山公路，因此需要來往香港迪士尼樂園度假區及香港國際機場的市民及旅客，亦有機會受北大嶼山公路的臨時交通管制措施影響，增加所需行車時間。

順朗路（來回方向）將於當日上午六時三十分開始封閉，並預計約下午二時還原有關路段後重開。在上述封路期間，運輸署將實施交通改道，原本行駛順朗路（來回方向）的車輛需要改經赤鱲角島，行車時間預計需要增加約10分鐘。巴士公司將張貼通告，通知乘客有關服務調整的詳情。

全運會統籌辦發言人表示，全國運動會是國家最高水平賽事，本次賽事在選擇賽道和組織安排上，需符合嚴格要求，以保障運動員安全。相關部門會合力做好特別交通運輸安排，以減低對平常使用港珠澳大橋和其他相關路段的市民和旅客的影響。發言人呼籲當日需要往返珠海和澳門的市民及旅客，及早計劃行程，並盡量使用其他口岸和公共交通。發言人感謝市民及旅客的體諒，以及有關機構及各部門齊心協力落實相關安排。"
Arrangements for 15th NG road cycling (men's individual) event (with photo/video),2025-10-14 22:30,2025-10-14 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400870.htm,"  The 15th National Games (NG) road cycling (men's individual) event will be held on November 8. A press conference hosted by the Head of the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) (NGCO), Mr Yeung Tak-keung,was held jointly with representatives of relevant government departments and the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China today (October 14) to announce details of the event and the relevant arrangements, including temporary traffic control measures, clearance arrangements at the boundary control point (BCP), and emergency response and rescue arrangements.

 The road cycling (men's individual) event this year is the only event that spans over Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in the 15th NG, and a tripartitetest event was held last November. In addition, a pre-event comprehensive drill was conducted on September 30 and the process was generally smooth. The official race covers a total distance of 231.8 kilometres, comprising a 55.8km section in Hong Kong. The race will enter Hong Kong from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) and go through the Hong Kong Port, North Lantau Highway and Penny's Bay Highway. The athletes will return after passing by Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and head back to Zhuhai via the HZMB and Hengqin.

 The race is scheduled to start at 9am on November 8, and is expected to conclude at 2.30pm. The event will feature 25 representative teams from the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao, with a total of 104 athletes competing. It is anticipated that the race convoy will enter the Hong Kong section around 10.20am and spend about one and a half hours in the Hong Kong section.

 To facilitate better viewing experience, a public viewing zone will be set up on the footpath of Fantasy Road located outside the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which can accommodate a few hundreds of spectators. Members of the public may come to cheer up the athletes and enjoy the race there. Implementation of crowd management measures will be made by the Police subject to conditions in the areas. Members of the public are advised to take heed of instructions of the Police and the staff on site. As temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the race route at the North Lantau Highway, members of the public should take the MTR to the Disneyland Resort station as far as possible to reach the designated viewing zone. The Guangdong competition region has commissioned the China Central Television as the host broadcaster to provide live webcast of the event. All rights-holding broadcasters, including the three local free television broadcasters and Radio Television Hong Kong, will be conferred the live signal.

 To facilitate the holding of the race, temporarily control measures will be implemented on the HZMB Hong Kong Port, the HZMB and some roads on that day. Relevant arrangements are set out as below:

(1) Clearance service arrangement

 On the event day, temporary control measures will be implemented on the HZMB eastbound from Zhuhai/Macao towards Hong Kong from 9am to 12.30pm, and on the HZMB westbound from Hong Kong towards Zhuhai/Macao from 7.30am to 12.30pm. During the temporary control period, all vehicles are prohibited from using the HZMB. Special arrangements will be implemented on the departure clearance services. Travellers or vehicles wishing to leave Hong Kong for Zhuhai or Macao before the implementation of the temporary control measures are required to arrive at the Departure Hall of Passenger Clearance Building or Outbound Vehicle Clearance Plaza of the HZMB Hong Kong Port before 6.30am on the event day in order to undergo departure and clearance procedures. The Departure Hall of Passenger Clearance Building and Outbound Vehicle Clearance Plaza of the HZMB Hong Kong Port will be closed at 6.30am.

 The departure and clearance services at the HZMB Hong Kong Port will resume after 12.30pm on that day. It is expected that traffic will be busy. Travellers and drivers who plan to use the bridge on that day are advised to plan their trips in advance and pay attention to the traffic control arrangements within Zhuhai.

(2) Public transport arrangements

 Cross-boundary public transport services travelling on the HZMB between Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao, including the HZMB shuttle bus (Gold Bus), cross-boundary coach and bus services of SkyPier Terminal Transfer Coach of Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), will be suspended during the implementation of the temporary control on the HZMB Main Bridge and the HZMB Hong Kong Port on that day. As the roads within Zhuhai are still closed for the race until about 2.30pm, the Gold Bus from Hong Kong to Zhuhai is expected to provide limited service from 12.30pm to 1.30pm while the Gold Bus from Zhuhai to Hong Kong will resume service at 2.30pm. Meanwhile, Gold Bus services to/from Macao will resume at 12.30pm.

  In addition, during the temporary control period, local public transport services to and from the HZMB Hong Kong Port will implement temporary services adjustment, including airport bus A routes, shuttle bus B routes and Disneyland R routes. The A routes from the airport will not pass through the Hong Kong Port from 10am to 1pm and the A route from urban and New Territories to the airport will not pass through the Hong Kong Port from the first departure to 11.30am. The shuttle bus services B4 and B5 serving between Airport/Sunny Bay Station and HZMB Hong Kong port will be suspended during certain periods. Routes R8 and R33, serving between Disneyland and the Lantau Link Interchange and Tuen Mun Station will also be suspended for some periods. Meanwhile, to facilitate the smooth implementation of the event, Shun Long Road (both bounds) will be closed (see details under (3) below) and affected bus routes will be temporarily diverted. The bus companies will issue notices to inform affected passengers of the details of the above service adjustment.

 The Transport Department (TD) will notify affected operators of cross-boundary and local public transport services, while the Marine Department will liaise with cross-boundary ferry operators, to work out manpower and frequency arrangements. During the temporary control period, travellers should consider the use of land BCPs between Hong Kong and Shenzhen for their travel between Hong Kong and Zhuhai. They should also consider taking cross-boundary ferry services between Hong Kong and Macao.

 Booking for the time slot between 6am and noon for Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles will be suspended. Subject to on-site traffic management arrangements on the event day, motorists who have made reservations in the afternoon on that day will only be allowed to enter the Vehicle Clearance Plaza of the Hong Kong Port after the temporary traffic control measures are lifted (estimated to be after around 12.30pm).

 Regarding passenger bus services of SkyPier Terminal Transfer Coach of the HKIA, the services between the HKIA and Zhuhai and Macao Port, will be suspended during the temporary control period at the Hong Kong Port of the HZMB. The Airport Authority Hong Kong will maintain close communication with all service operators and continuously monitor the situation to implement timely adjustments as needed.

 In addition, the 15th NG road cycling (women's individual) event will be held on November 9. Though the race course will mainly be located in Zhuhai and will not affect the HZMB and clearance services at the port, some of the roads in Zhuhai will be closed due to the event. From 7.30am to 11.30am that day, only limited services for routes departing for Zhuhai will be provided by the Gold Bus. Members of the public are advised to avoid taking the Gold Bus to Zhuhai during the abovementioned periods. Moreover, some of the ferry services between Hong Kong and Zhuhai Jiuzhou Port will also be suspended on November 8 and 9.

(3) Road traffic control measures

 Temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the North Lantau Highway and roads near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort during the race period of Hong Kong section (exact time will depend on the actual progress of the race).

 Temporary traffic control measures will be implemented in the vicinity of the race route on the North Lantau Highway. The travel time to and from the airport via the North Lantau Highway is expected to increase by about 30 minutes. Members of the public and travellers who plan to travel to and from the airport should plan their trips in advance and allow sufficient travelling time. They are advised to use railway services, including the Airport Express, the Tung Chung line and the Disneyland Resort line, and avoid driving to the relevant area. Drivers who need to drive to the airport may consider using the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Tunnel.

 Temporary traffic control measures will be implemented on the race route near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort during the race. Travelling time to and from the park, hotels and the Inspiration Lake Recreation Centre via Penny's Bay Highway, Sunny Bay Road, Magic Road and Fantasy Road may be increased by about 30 minutes due to the traffic control measures. Members of the public who plan to travel to the vicinity of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort should consider using railway services as far as possible.

 In addition, as this road section connects to the North Lantau Highway, members of the public and travellers who need to travel between the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and the HKIA may also be affected by the temporary traffic control measures on the North Lantau Highway, and the travelling time required may be increased.

Shun Long Road (both bounds) will be closed starting from 6.30am and expected to reopen at about 2pm on that day after the related road section returns to normal. During the above road closure period, the TD will implement traffic diversion such that the original traffic of Shun Long Road (both bounds) will be diverted via Chek Lap Kok Island. The journey time is expected to increase by about 10 minutes. The bus companies will issue notices to inform passengers of the details of service adjustment.

 A spokesperson for the NGCO said as the NG is the country's highest-level event, this event has to meet stringent requirements in terms of the selection of race course and the organisational arrangements to ensure the safety of athletes. Relevant departments will work together to facilitate the special traffic and transportation arrangements to minimise the impact on the public and travellers who usually use the HZMB and other related road sections. Members of the public and travellers who need to travel to and from Zhuhai or Macao are urged to plan their itinerariesin advance, and use other control points and public transport as far as possible.The spokesperson thanked members of the public and travellers for their understanding, as well as the contributions of various organisations and departments to implementing the relevant arrangements."

The Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat, officiated at the ceremony and presented appointment certificates to 17 non-official members from the precious metals and stone industry.

The Advisory Group is a non-statutory body comprising official members from Customs and non-official members from the industry, with a view to providing both sides with a platform for exchanging views on the registration regime for precious metals and stone dealers. Customs can also keep better tabs on the industry to push ahead with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing work.

Mr Chan expressed gratitude to members of the Advisory Group for their continuous support, saying that the regulatory regime for dealers in precious metals and stones has been widely accepted by the industry since its implementation, indicating a mutual commitment to compliance within the industry. Customs will continue to collaborate with the new-term Advisory Group in strengthening the compliance awareness of the industry, combating anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, and propelling Hong Kong into an international gold trading market by establishing a transparent, robust and internationally aligned regulatory system, thereby strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

According to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615), unless exempted, any person who is seeking to carry on a business of dealing in precious metals and stones and engage in any transaction(s) (whether making or receiving a payment) with a total value at or above HK$120,000 in Hong Kong is required to register with Hong Kong Customs.

Addressing the ceremony, Dr Choi said that since April 2023, with the assistance of various Mainland provinces and municipalities, the Education Bureau (EDB) has arranged for more than 140 000 students to participate in the CS Mainland study tours. She expressed hope that these ""classrooms on the move"" will inspire students' curiosity, enabling them to constantly explore new knowledge and reflect on what they have learned through immersive learning experiences.

She thanked the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Ministry of Education, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission for their thoughtful arrangements, enabling students to gain a deeper understanding of Chongqing's urban development. Students were also offered an opportunity to visit wartime relics in this year of the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance, commemoratingthe fallen heroes in defence of the nation and reflecting on the importance of peace.

At the same time, Dr Choi signed a Memorandum of Understanding on education co-operation between Chongqing and Hong Kong with representatives of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission.

To optimise the learning outcomes of the CS Mainland study tours, the EDB held a seminar on the tours in the morning with representatives from all the 11 participating provinces and cities to summarise work experiences and strengthen collaboration and exchanges. At the seminar, representatives from participating provinces and cities were enthusiastic to share their experiences and views, helping enrich the content of future study tours and provide students with excellent learning experiences.

Yesterday and today, Dr Choi visited Chongqing University and Chongqing Jiaotong University respectively. She said that higher education institutions in Hong Kong and Chongqing have been conducting professional exchanges through various means. Co-operation covers talent cultivation, student admissions and employment, and scientific research. The EDB will continue to support exchanges and co-operation between higher education institutions in the two places to nurture talent for the country's development.

Dr Choi also met with Hong Kong students in Chongqing to learn about their studies and daily life. She said that Hong Kong students living in Chongqing have the opportunities to gain more in-depth knowledge about the country's developments and cultivate affection for the country. She encouraged them to seize the learning opportunities and contribute to the country's high-quality development.

Dr Choi met representatives of the Office of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Affairs of the Ministry of Education, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chongqing Municipal People's Government over two days to exchange views on strengthening education collaboration between Mainland and Hong Kong, as well as Chongqing and Hong Kong.

About 50 business people from both delegations attended the seminar.

  In her welcome remarks, the Director-General of the HKETO Jakarta, Miss Libera Cheng, said that ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" proposed supporting Hong Kong small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups in exploring overseas markets. It also proposed to establish the ""Economic and Trade Express"" by joining forces of ETOs, the overseas offices of Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council to form a functional platform to enhance synergy and capitalise on their complementary advantages to help Hong Kong enterprises to ""go global"". She encouraged Hong Kong enterprises to leverage the visit to actively explore Indonesia's market potential and identify business opportunities.

  On the same day, the HKETO Jakarta also co-organised with the Indonesia Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (InachamHK) a networking dinner that brought together around 80 guests from the two delegations and several major Indonesian business chambers. The event provided an important platform for the Hong Kong and Indonesian business communities to exchange views, thereby helping Hong Kong enterprises to expand their networks, and helping business people of both sides to understand each other's markets.

  The two visiting delegations were the Indonesia: Forging New Opportunities Together delegation co-organised by the Y.

Immigration Department arrests 16 persons during operations targeting foreign domestic helpers who breach conditions of stay (with photos),2025-10-14 20:03,2025-10-14 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400694.htm,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Swordfish"", for three consecutive days from October 12 to 14, targeting foreign domestic helpers who breached their conditions of stay. A total of 16 persons, including ten suspected illegal workers and six suspected employers, were arrested.

During the operation, ImmD investigators raided 26 target locations including restaurants, guesthouses, retail stores and commercial buildings. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised ten women, aged 26 to 43. Among them, five persons were current helpers, three persons were overstaying ex-helpers, one person was visitor and one person was found to be an imported worker. ImmD investigators found most of the suspected illegal workers at restaurants or guesthouses performing dishwashing, cleaning, etc. Meanwhile, six suspected employers, comprising five men and one woman, aged 41 to 63.

""A helper should only perform domestic duties for the employer as listed in the ""Schedule of Accommodation and Domestic Duties"" attached to the Contract. The helper should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employer should not require or allow the helper to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

In addition, the spokesman warned that, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
入境處打擊外傭違反逗留條件　共拘十六人（附圖）,2025-10-14 20:02,2025-10-14 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400695.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月十二日至今日（十月十四日）一連三日在全港各區展開代號「劍魚」的反非法勞工行動。在該項打擊外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在港違反逗留條件的行動中，入境處共拘捕16名人士，包括十名懷疑非法勞工及六名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的人士。

行動中，入境處人員一共搜查了26個目標地點，包括餐廳、賓館、零售店舖及商業大廈等。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為十名女子，年齡介乎26至43歲。當中五名為現職外傭、三名為逾期逗留的前外傭、一名訪客、以及一名輸入勞工。被捕的非法勞工主要在餐廳及賓館從事洗碗及清潔等工作。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的六名人士為五男一女，年齡介乎41至63歲。

入境處發言人說：「外傭只能根據合約附錄的「住宿及家務安排」為僱主料理家務。外傭不得受僱於其他人士擔任任何職務，包括兼職家務工作。僱主亦不得要求或容許傭工為其他人士擔任任何工作。」

入境處發言人強調：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

此外，入境處發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰會由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

Hong Kong Customs and Hong Kong Police Force detect two suspected illicit cigarette smuggling cases in joint anti-smuggling operation (with photos),2025-10-14 19:45,2025-10-14 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400719.htm,"Hong Kong Customs and the New Territories South Traffic Division of the Hong Kong Police Force mounted a joint anti-smuggling operation yesterday (October 13) at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Port and detected two suspected illicit cigarette smuggling cases with about 270 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes seized. The total estimated market value was about $1.4 million and the duty potential was about $880,000. Four men, aged between 28 and 58, were arrested and two private cars involved in the cases were also seized.

Based on risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Customs and police officers intercepted two inbound private cars at the HZMB Hong Kong Port yesterday. Upon inspection of the first private car, Customs officers seized about 130 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes from the front and rear passenger seats, the boot and hollow spaces of the vehicle. A 36-year-old male driver and a 28-year-old male passenger were arrested. Subsequently, Customs officers seized about 140 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes with a similar concealment in the second private car. A 51-year-old male driver and a 58-year-old male passenger were also arrested.

The four arrested men have each been charged with one count of importing goods to which the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) applies. The cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 15).

Members of the public are reminded that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement action to combat cross-boundary smuggling activities.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
立法會財務委員會及其轄下兩個小組委員會各主席於年結記者會上的發言全文（只有中文）,2025-10-14 19:21,2025-10-14 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400673.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是立法會財務委員會（財委會）主席陳振英、人事編制小組委員會主席易志明和工務小組委員會主席謝偉銓今日（十月十四日）舉行年結記者會的發言全文：

財委會主席陳振英：

歡迎大家出席財委會與兩個小組委員會聯合舉行的簡報會。我會首先匯報財委會的工作，然後兩個小組委員會的主席會分別報告小組委員會的工‍作。

今個會期財委會運作暢順，委員繼續嚴謹認真、理性務實地審批政府的撥款建議，做好把關。截至今年十月三日，即財委會今個會期最後一次會議，獲財委會批准的項目有67項，合共涉及的承擔額約為1,268億元，政府提交的所有項目均已完成審議，包括：

（一）20項人事編制及28項工務工程撥款建議；以及

（二）19項非工務工程撥款建議，涉及承擔額約186億元，包括「創科產業引導基金」（100億元）、「前沿科技研究支援計劃」（30億元）等。

在今個會期，財委會合共舉行了35次會議，總時數約71小時41分鐘。就需要討論的撥款項目，項目的平均審議時間約為1小時29分鐘。部分較受關注的項目，例如香港中文大學醫院發展計劃貸款的安排，以及「創科產業引導基金」相關撥款建議，財委會用了較長時間討論，分別用了約3小時及2小時審議有關建議。我想重申，不能單以財委會會議時數來衡量立法會審議撥款建議的工作，而是要計及申請相關撥款的整個流程，包括諮詢相關事務委員會等。

財委會在今年四月舉行了21個環節共約34小時的特別會議，審核二○二五至二○二六年度的開支預算。88位議員就開支預算的內容提出合共約3 900條書面問題。在特別會議上，議員進一步就開支項目請官員提供資料，並就預算案內各項與公共開支相關的措施提出意見。議員關注到，多個政策局在回覆議員的書面問題時，不少都表示沒有備存相關數據或資料，部分答覆內容亦流於籠統。我期望政府參考議員的建議，加強數據收集和分析的工作，此舉不但有助政府回答議員提問，更能以客觀數據為依據，按科學方法制訂更精準到位的政策及措施。

在政府提交財委會審議的48項人事編制和工務工程建議中，財委會曾進一步討論的有四項，當中三項是小組委員會建議進一步討論。有一項建議是小組委員會不建議財委會進一步討論，但其後有財委會委員聯名要求討論並獲委員會同意，這個項目就是重置域多利亞公眾殮房建造工程。多名委員在會議上就項目設計、空間運用、工程價格等多方面事宜提問，例如善用地下岩洞會否反而增加工程成本、如何運用地面和岩洞的空間才更具成本效益。當中帶出了一個重要的信息，就是委員經常強調，就是當局應提前在選址階段加入成本控制的概念，考慮不同地點對工程成本的影響，並在討論文件提供不同方案的比較資料，讓議員審議財務建議時有多角度的考慮。

香港現時面對財赤，在「財政彈藥」不多的情況下，議員一方面「急市民所急」，協助政府「應慳則慳」，同時確保政府「應使則使」，在有需要的範疇投放足夠資源，做到「拼經濟、謀發展、惠民生」。「開源」和「節流」同樣重要，我們不能只着眼赤字規模，而一味縮減開支，更重要是在現時經濟轉型期，發掘新增長點，同時善用現有資源，推動經濟增長。所謂危中有機，建議當局全面檢討理財方式，優化財政資源配置，為經濟發展注入動力。

現屆政府敢於破局，積極整合財政、開源節流，例如向財委會申請將六個規模較大的種子基金未來五年不需要動用的約620億元結餘，回撥至政府帳目，以及檢視各項計劃的財政承擔額，包括將購置社福處所已核准的承擔額下調。有關做法將公共財政資源「解鎖」，讓政府可以更靈活和有效地運用公共資源。委員都認同這個方向，並促請政府盡快檢視其他種子基金的運作模式，以及增加基金收支細項的透明度，令議員和公眾更掌握基金的運作詳情。

立法會支持香港特別行政區（特區）政府推動創科發展，而本地科研轉化為經濟成果初見成效。香港在世界數碼競爭力的科技排名世界第三，《2025年全球創新指數》世界百強科技集群「深圳—香港—廣州」集群排名第一。為抓緊科技創新的發展勢頭及機遇，完善創科建設策略布局，財委會在今個年度繼續「加碼」，批出多個與科研有關的撥款建議，合計超過140億元，包括「創科產業引導基金」（100億元）、「前沿科技研究支援計劃」（30億元）、設立香港人工智能研發院（10億元）等。

值得一提的是創科產業引導基金，政府會以有限合夥人的形式參與基金運作，引導市場資金投資指定策略性新興和未來產業；標誌着政府革新投資創新及科技產業的思路，亦是對接國家發展「耐心資本」的戰略，進一步推動「政、產、學、研、投」的高效協作。這個項目上百億元，委員在審議撥款建議時都「慎之又慎」，全方位就資本回報率、行政費、監察及退出機制等事宜提問。我希望政府在推行有關計劃時，考慮委員的意見和建議，「打好這手牌」，確保基金達到預期的回報。

另一方面，在今個會期，各部門為推動智慧城市建設，相繼向財委會提交多項有關優化資訊科技設施的撥款建議，合計獲撥款超過44億元，包括為香港警務處開發新一代通訊系統（約20億元），優化皇崗口岸電腦系統（約9.5億元）、更換或更新策略性道路的交通管制及監察系統（約5.7億元）等。

現在我請兩位小組委員會主席向大家匯報。先請人事編制小組委員會主席易志明。

人事編制小組委員會主席易志明：

各位傳媒朋友，很高興今日在此向大家匯報人事編制小組委員會在二○二五年會期的工作。

小組委員會在今個會期共審議並通過了18項人事編制建議，均已獲財委會批‍准，這些建議涉及多個民生項目，亦涉及土地供應、「搶人才」、保護關鍵基礎設施、鞏固提升香港國際金融中心地位等相關政策落實，助力香港拼經濟、謀發展。

涉及的首長級職位包括：

（一）開設一個常額職位，設於關鍵基礎設施（電腦系統安全）專責辦公室，負責保護關鍵基礎設施的電腦系統和網絡安全，以及制訂相關《實務守則》；

（二）刪除兩個常額職位，即設於香港金融管理局的兩個助理銀行監理專員職位；

（三）開設四個有時限職位，包括設於土木工程拓展署的一個有時限職位，負責南拓展及可持續大嶼辦事處的工作；設於關鍵基礎設施（電腦系統安全）專責辦公室的兩個有時限職位，負責實施各項與保護關鍵基礎設施安全相關的工作；以及設於食物環境衞生署，負責監督私營骨灰安置所及市政基建規劃的一個有時限職位；

（四）保留18個有時限職位，例如財經事務及庫務局的兩個有時限職位，負責推動公司註冊制度、會計專業及金融科技的工作，以及勞工及福利局的三個有時限職位，負責招攬和支援人才、人力規劃及研究的工作；以‍及

（五）將一個非公務員常設職位轉為公務員常設職位，該職位設於教育署，負責推動香港教育更高質量發展，為國家建設「教育強國」的目標作出貢獻。

今個會期，小組委員會共召開了10次會議，總時數約18.3小時，每個項目的審議時數平均約一小時。每個項目都先經相關事務委員會討論政策事宜，才交上小組委員會，經小組委員會通過後再交上財委會，整個討論過程相當認真和深入。

我觀察到，委員在討論人事編制建議時，提問內容精準到位，聚焦於建議開設或保留職位的理據、有關職位的性質、所屬職級、開設年期、分工安排，以及績效指標等細節，這些問題都是公眾最為關注的。委員在審議開設新職位的建議時，都會詳‍細審視有關職位是否有必要，以及可否透過內‍部調配代替增‍聘人手等，以確保政府恪守審‍慎理財、財政資源用得其所，以及公務員編制零增長的原‍則。當局亦有針對委員的提問作具體回應。

另外，委員讚賞一些部門主動積極，例如提前騰空不予保留的有時限職位，盡快幫政府「慳荷包」，以及「應慳則慳」，暫緩開設若干職位，改以內部調配替代。

本年度是本屆立法會最後一個會期。回顧第七屆立法會四年會期，小組委員會審議並通過62項人事編制建議，均獲財委會批准。我寄望下屆立法會的人事編制小組委員會，繼續以專業、嚴謹和高效的態度，全面審視政府提出的人事編制建議，確保資源配置公平，並發揮最大效益。

人力資源是推動社會進步與經濟發展的重要動能，亦是實現香港長遠發展及提升競爭力的關鍵因素。小組委員會要以創新的視角，積極應對未來社會變遷帶來的挑戰，持續優化公共服務隊伍、為香港的可持續發展奠定堅實基礎、為市民提供更優質高效的公共服務，確保政府政策得以有效執行。

最後，我想特別感謝副主席陳祖恒。這段時間，我們並肩合作、互相支持，齊心推動小組委員會的工作。多得副主席的投入和幫忙，很多事情才能順利完成。多謝各位。

財委會主席陳振英：

謝謝易志明，現在請工務小組委員會主席謝偉銓。

工務小組委員會主席謝偉銓：

各位傳媒朋友，很高興今日在此和大‍家分享工‍務小組委員會在二○二五年會期的工作。

先講講一些數字，今個會期，工務小‍組委員會共舉行了17次會議，總時數超過36小時，包括應政‍府要求而加開了七次會議，共約16小時。小組委員會共審議了28項工務工程撥‍款建議，總‍撥款額達1,082億元，全部建議已‍獲財委會批准。

這28項工務工程，當中約311億元，即近三成的撥款額，是用於北部都會區（北都）的基礎設施工程，包括元朗南新發展區第二期發展的工地平整及基礎設施工程（約138億元）、洪水橋淨水設施（約67億元）、牛潭尾濾水廠擴展工程（約96億元）及新界北區食水供應改善工程（約10億元）。顯示立法會充分配合當局推動北都提速發展；另有約28%的工務工程撥款額，是與環境政策相關，涉及款項約305億‍元。

每項工務工程撥款建議平均審議‍時間約為1小時19分鐘，其中較受公眾關注的撥款建議，例‍如涉及超過一萬個有利社會民生的小型工程項目、撥款額416億元的二○二五至二○二六年度基本工程儲備基金整體撥款；以及造價12億元的重置域多利亞公眾殮房項目，小組委員會均用了超過兩小時深入討論。

小組委員會為市民嚴謹把關，監察政府的工務工程支出。委員亦見到政府努力壓縮工程成本。以搬遷沙田污水處理廠往岩洞的餘下工程為例，去年七月諮詢發展事務委員會時，項目預算超過156億元，在今年六月提交予工務小組委員會審議時，預算約為129億3,000萬元，減少了約27億元。當中做了不少工作，包括渠務署就機電工程合約採用「直接採購」模式，由政府直接採購合適的大型機電設備。與傳統的「連工包料」模式相比，有助節省約17億元，是委員在這方面和政府努力所減省。

委員留意到現時每個工務工程項目均會預留相等於有關工程估計費用的10%作應急費用，關注此「一刀切」的做法是否恰當，會否不必要地凍結了政府的財政資源，因此委員促請當局研究，可否因應項目的規模和性質，設定不同應急費用百分比上限。委員亦注意到，政府現時委託房委會推展工務工程，需支付相當於工程費用12.5%的間接費用。委員建議政府檢討有關間接費用有沒有下調空間，從而降低工程的預算費。

因應委員的意見，發展局與財經事務及庫務局正檢討現行工務工程項目的資源運用機制，包括有關應急費用機制，以及就推展工務工程支付予不同機構，例如香港鐵路有限公司、醫院管理局、香港房屋委員會等的間接費用的百分比。我期望當局在不久的將來與議會分享有關檢討結果。

立法會不同委員會在公共財政及審批撥款上扮演不同角色。當項目經過相關事務委員會討論後，來到工務小組委員會則聚焦工程事宜，我留意到委員都是積極務‍實地參與討論，反映地區人士及市民大眾的關注和期望。在第‍七‍屆立法會的四個會期內，小‍組委員會合共通過121‍項工務工程撥‍款建議，總撥款額達5,237‍億元。

政府持續投資基本工程，致力改善市民生活質素、推動香港經濟發展和提升香港長遠競爭力。但建造業面對建造成本高昂、人力短缺等挑戰，市民亦關注工務工程項目開支情況。鑑於當前本港經濟和公共財政狀況，有議員認為政府應檢視現有的工務工程項目清單，審時度勢，按緩急輕重有序落實各個項目；政府亦應維持每年工務工程的投入總規模，防止（工程量）大起大落的情況出現。行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》中提到，政府原訂未來五年的基本工程開支每年平均約為1,200億元沒有改變，並提出額外預留300億元，在未來兩至三年加大工程項目開支，議員樂見政府支持本地建造業和持續推動經濟發展。

以上就是我跟大家分享有關工務小組委員會在今‍個會期的工作。最後，我藉此機會感謝副‍主‍席陳恒鑌，我們「拍住上」，一同做好小組委員會的每項工作。現在我將時間交給財委會主席。

財委會主席陳振英：

現在由我作一個總結。今個會期，財委會和兩個小組委員會繼續妥善履行審批政府撥款建議的職能，審議過程嚴謹、審慎和有效率，適時批准所需撥款，配合政府致力落實各項振興經濟的政策措施。回望第七屆立法會的四個年頭，財委會批准的財務建議合共261項，撥款總額達6,972億元，當中不少撥款建議都是助力擴充經濟容量和加強香港競爭力，以及對接國家發展戰略。最新一份《施政報告》亦提出了一系列經濟政策和措施，相信未來財委會審議的撥款建議，會繼續以推動經濟轉型為重點。

近年香港經歷了不少挑戰，特別是國際地緣政局干擾貿易和投資市場，不但考驗香港經濟的韌力，亦考驗政府的管治及理財能力，同時考驗財委會如何在保持公共財政穩健的前提下，謹慎和適度審批撥款，為社會及經濟創造價值。

我寄語下屆財委會及兩個小組委員會，除了一如既往繼續把關，代表市民「睇實個荷包」，亦要與時並進，用創新思維、新角度審視政府的財務建議，為建構公共財政和經濟的新格局出一分力。

我亦期望特區政府繼續秉持「取之有度，用之有節」的原則，謹慎理財，恪守節度，善用每分資源，把公帑花在最需要的地方，既保障民生，也提升服務，讓市民能真正受惠。

最後，本屆立法會已接近尾聲，我在此要感謝副主席周浩鼎就財委會的運作提供意見及協助主持部分會議。我亦感謝易志明及謝偉銓兩位主席，以及陳祖恒及陳恒鑌兩位副主席，帶領兩個小組委員會，協助財委會審議撥款建議。此外，我亦感謝法律顧問和其他立法會秘書處同事為委員會繁重的工作提供專業支援。多謝大家。"
​香港海關於機場偵破一宗入境旅客販毒案件（附圖）,2025-10-14 19:00,2025-10-14 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400518.htm,"香港海關於十月十二日在香港國際機場偵破一宗涉及三名入境旅客的販毒案件，共檢獲約十四公斤、估計市值約三百萬元的懷疑大麻花。

一名二十六歲的男旅客及一名二十二歲的女旅客當日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在其各自的手提行李內發現該批偽裝成食品的懷疑大麻花，遂把二人拘捕。

Hong Kong Customs detects drug trafficking case involving incoming passengers at airport (with photo),2025-10-14 19:00,2025-10-14 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400521.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected a drug trafficking case involving three incoming passengers at Hong Kong International Airport on October 12 and seized about 14 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $3 million.

A 26-year-old male passenger and a 22-year-old female passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, on that day. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds disguised as food in their respective carry-on luggage. They were subsequently arrested.

After a follow-up investigation, Customs officers further arrested a 32-year-old female passenger, who was also arriving from Bangkok, Thailand, and suspected to be connected with the case, at the airport on the same day.

After an investigation, the three persons involved in the case have been jointly charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 15).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-14 18:38,2025-10-14 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400677.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月十四日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

首宗個案涉及一名28歲男子，住所位於九龍城區。初步調查顯示，他於十月六日至九日到訪廣東省中山市。他於十月十二日出現關節痛，翌日（十月十三日）出現發燒，同日到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

他有一名家居接觸者，曾於相若時間到中山市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

另一宗個案涉及一名47歲男子，住所位於九龍城區。初步調查顯示，他於十月五日至七日獨自到訪廣東省江門市。他於十月十三日出現發燒、皮疹和關節痛，同日到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

他有一名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於上述兩名病人於潛伏期身處廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得35宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月五日至十一日）廣東省新增2 257宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別3 181宗（九月二十八日至十月四日）及3 153宗(九月二十一日至二十七日）有所下降。上周大部分個案（1 255宗）在江門市錄得，其次為廣州（201宗）及佛山（196宗），全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。近期江門市基孔肯雅熱疫情呈波動下降趨勢，但仍在較高水平。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：

在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及

  Since the two patients stayed in Guangdong Province during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 35 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 257 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 5 to 11), showing a decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 3 181 cases (September 28 to October 4) and 3 153 cases (September 21 to 27) respectively. Most of the cases (1 255 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Guangzhou (201 cases) and Foshan (196 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of CF cases in Jiangmen has fluctuated downward recently, the level remained relatively high.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  â
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
  ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

​勞工及福利局局長為第二十四屆香港職業安全健康大奬分享會暨頒獎典禮主禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-14 18:10,2025-10-14 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400672.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十月十四日）下午為第二十四屆香港職業安全健康大奬分享會暨頒獎典禮主禮的致辭全文：

林楚賢教授（職業安全健康局（職安局）副主席）、許處長（勞工處處長許澤森）、柱哥（勞工顧問委員會僱主代表、香港中華總商會永遠榮譽會長何世柱）、沛良（立法會議員陳沛良）、小松（立法會議員兼港九勞工社團聯會秘書長周小松）、Bonnie（職業安全健康局總幹事游雯）：

大家好！好高興再次出席香港職業安全健康大奬分享會暨頒獎典禮。這項由職業安全健康局及勞工處聯同多個政府部門、機構、商會及工會合辦的年度盛事，活動舉辦得一年比一年好。剛剛的短片時間雖短，但讓人有金像獎的感覺，頒獎禮不經不覺已經辦了20幾年，凝聚了無數單位的力量，共同推廣職安健文化，並獲得業界廣泛支持。今年比賽一如以往反應非常熱烈，共收到近1 200個參賽申請，競逐九個獎項類別。這背後代表的不單單是數字，而是整個社會和業界對建立更安全、更健康職安健文化的決心。

特區政府一直十分關注各行業工友的工作安全及健康，並持續與各界攜手合作，致力提升整體職安健表現。過去數年，香港職安健的總體情況持續有進步，但每年工業意外的致命個案仍然超過20宗，顯示我們仍需齊心合力加把勁，持續加強保障每位工友的生命安全。

勞工處一向高度重視職安健情況，針對問題痛點，按風險為本原則靈活調整策略，展開精準的巡查執法、宣傳推廣及教育培訓，同時積極配合發展局推動建造業善用創新科技，持續完善工作守則及指引，目標以多管齊下的方法打出「組合拳」，積極推動職安健文化，預防意外發生，全面提升香港職安健水平。

隨着智慧科技迅速發展，人工智能（AI）已廣泛應用於職安健領域，有助提前識別潛在風險，目標亦是保障工友的安全。今年初，勞工處已發布經修訂的《預防被貨車尾板夾傷的危害安全指引》（《指引》），如果大家從事這個行業應該知道，尾板安全時常出現問題，有了這個《指引》後，我認為大大提升了於尾板工作的安全性，《指引》明確接納使用AI技術的觸覺式裝置，提升尾板運作安全性，在這裏要多謝同事與業界商討，經歷包括我在內的多任處長，這絕對是一個很重要的里程碑。另外，勞工處亦樂見部分承建商嘗試引入遙距操控天秤系統，我對此十分期待。操作員可以從地下像操作遊戲機一樣來操控天秤，無需進行高空作業，這件事是功德無量的。我期待業界嘗試運用系統後，證明系統是可行的，政府會全力配合，令未來年輕人多一條出路，擅於玩遊戲機的可以操作天秤，重要是可以改善這行業的職安健，除降低作業風險外，對身體健康亦有幫助，因為高空作業未必能隨時上冼手間，進食亦要在高空中，政府會努力進行這方面的工作。

同時，勞工處同事十分有創新精神，他們本月開始正式使用小型無人機，應用科技強化巡查。若有僱主欲藉詞違規，我先把話說清楚，不要以為沒有勞工處的同事在場就無人監管，天上是有無人機的。我們已進行測試，效果十分滿意，所以應用無人機的技術是能大大提升我們巡查的效率、以及蒐證能力，令違規行為無所遁形。明年，我們將與職安局合辦第二屆職安健創新及科技博覽，第一屆十分成功，令我更期待第二屆的舉行，除展示我們正使用的技術，亦能彰顯香港的科技創新，通過這個博覽凝聚各界，令大家用好科技提升職安健。

提升香港的職安健水平是大家共同的責任，這句說話雖然老土，但永遠都是對的，即需要政府、僱主、僱員及各持責者一起以團隊精神將職安健做好，時刻不能鬆懈，希望能攜手，經過日積月累的努力，有一日我們能慢慢地改變職安健文化，繼而進一步提升職安健的水平。今日的頒獎典禮見證了所有卓越機構努力的成果，更展現了香港各界對職安健的決心與承諾。讓我們攜手推動創新、用心守護每一位工友，為香港建立一個更安全、更健康的工作環境。在此多謝大家的參與，祝各位身體健康、工作平安！"
創新科技及工業局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-10-14 17:53,2025-10-14 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/14/P2025101400643.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十月十四日）出席香港新型工業加速前行─「新型工業加速計劃」項目起動儀式後會見傳媒的談話內容：

創新科技及工業局局長：今天非常高興來見證亞洲先進同位素技術公司於香港科技園轄下的大埔創新園正式建立Alpha核素生產線，以及小型超導迴旋加速器生產線，他們計劃於二○二七年開始首次在香港生產這種目前全球緊缺的AC225核素，這也是首次在亞洲生產這種正在進行臨床試驗的靶向性核素藥物的重要原料。

該公司計劃在香港投資約6億港元，主要是用來購買儀器設備、建立智能生產線，以及廠房裝修、改造等。這個項目充分體現了由海外引進先進技術在香港落地生產這樣一個成功路徑，通過引進國外先進製藥技術，在香港落地建立生產線，建立製造Made in Hong Kong的產品，進一步在整個亞洲以至全球擴展相關的業務。這種「引進來、走出去」的模式將會加速在香港建立創科產業，為香港經濟注入新動能。

我期待未來能見到更多這樣的成功案例，與我們特區政府、社會各界一起加速推進香港新型工業化，一起擦亮「香港研發、香港製造、邁向世界」這樣一個品牌。下面我樂意回答記者朋友提出的問題。

記者：「新型工業加速計劃」推出以來，差不多一年，共批出多少個生產線、項目？還有批出多少資助？

創新科技及工業局局長：這個計劃是從去年下半年推出，至今我們已經審視了十來個項目，我們正式批出了三個項目，還有幾個項目目前正在審視。隨着未來香港特別是北部都會區加快建設，香港創科生態越來越好，我相信會有更多申請，而且我們也會批出更多項目。

記者：這個是比較高科技和高監管門檻的項目，為何認為香港適合這些高端製造業落戶？

創新科技及工業局局長：首先，這是國際先進技術在香港落地，它生產的產品也是目前全球緊缺的產品，我剛才也講這將是目前在亞洲唯一生產（靶向性）核素藥物的關鍵原料，符合香港定位——即是高技術、高增值的發展路向。我們希望未來有更多這樣的高新技術、科技含量比較高的，而且充滿國際化的企業能夠在香港落戶，以滿足現在香港希望在全球發展創新科技的布局、創科產業的計劃。我可以高興的跟你講，現在還有幾個項目正在審核當中，會越來越多。

記者：可否再說出在100億元計劃中批出了多少資助？

創新科技及工業局局長：項目的總投資額共17億元，主要是有三個項目，陸續會有更多，因為我們總共拿出了100億元去支持，17億元的項目裏，政府資助的大概有三分之一，所以我們還有很大的空間。我們希望能夠在未來的幾年批出50個或以上的項目。"

李家超表示，現行的「港資港法」和「港資港仲裁」已納入成為《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》下的措施，體現中央政府對於香港法律制度的重視與支持。香港會繼續用好與國際接軌的普通法制度和爭議解決服務的獨特優勢，全面發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台作用，服務大灣區建立更國際化的營商環境。

李家超指出，香港擁有世界級的法律及爭議解決服務專業人才，亦是亞太區最受歡迎的仲裁地。隨着國際調解院總部落戶香港，香港會繼續積極深化國際交往合作，支持國際調解院提供友好、靈活、經濟和高效的調解服務，同時鞏固香港國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的定位，進一步強化香港作為國際法律樞紐和調解之都的地位。

Mr Lee welcomed Mr Zhang and his delegation to Hong Kong to attend an exchange event among the judicial and legal sectors. He expressed his gratitude to the Supreme People's Court (SPC) for its support of the Department of Justice, including establishing extensive mutual legal assistance in civil and commercial matters, setting up a standing interface platform on judicial and legal co-operation in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and supporting Hong Kong to develop itself as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services.

Mr Lee noted that the current measures of allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law and allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration have been incorporated into the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, reflecting the Central Government's emphasis and support for Hong Kong's legal system. Hong Kong will continue to leverage its unique advantages in its internationalised common law system and dispute resolution services to fully play its role as a two-way platform for enterprises to go global and attract external investment, serving the GBA in building a more internationalised business environment.

Mr Lee highlighted that Hong Kong boasts world-class legal and dispute resolution professionals, and is also the most preferred seat of arbitration in the Asia-Pacific region. With the establishment of the International Organization for Mediation’s (IOMed) headquarters in Hong Kong, the city will continue to actively deepen international exchanges and co-operation, and support the IOMed's provision of friendly, flexible, economical and efficient mediation services to consolidate its status as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services, and reinforce its positions as an international legal hub and the capital of mediation.

The Executive Vice-president of the SPC, Mr Deng Xiuming; Vice-president of the SPC Mr Mao Zhonghua; and the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, also attended the meeting."

  The IRD referred the case to the ICAC for investigation, and has fully co-operated with the ICAC in the investigation and provided full assistance.

  The Assistant Taxation Officer concerned has been interdicted from duty since September 2023. In view of the ongoing legal proceedings, the IRD will not comment on the specifics of the case.

  The IRD attaches utmost importance to the protection of taxpayers' information. All staff are bound by the official secrecy provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance and the Business Registration Ordinance. They are prohibited from communicating taxpayers' information to any person except in the performance of their duties. The IRD's internal guidelines also clearly set out how the staff should comply with the official secrecy provisions. A mechanism has been put in place to monitor whether the staff access taxpayers' information in the IRD's computer system only when performing duties, including keeping records of staff's access to the computer system and conducting surprise checks and reviews from time to time.

  To further enhance the protection of taxpayers' information and the handling of public enquiries, the IRD has conducted a thorough review of the relevant work procedures and invited the ICAC's Corruption Prevention Department to provide suggestions. The IRD is implementing the enhancement measures progressively, which include conducting random checks on staff's access to information in the computer system more frequently, reviewing staff's access right to the information in the computer system, arranging supervisory staff to conduct inspections at enquiry counters, and installing closed-circuit television systems at the enquiry counters concerned to enhance surveillance."
