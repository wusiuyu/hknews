立法會二十二題：玩具安全,2025-07-16 16:40,2025-07-16 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600566.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上周文港議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

據報部分玩具（例如「鬼口水」、強力磁珠及水珠玩具等）存在安全隱患，例如美國在二○二三年錄得6000宗兒童因不慎使用水珠玩具而須緊急就診的個案，更有一名十個月大的嬰兒因此死亡；本港亦發生不少因玩具安全而危害兒童健康的個案。就玩具安全，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年香港海關（海關）（i）為執行《玩具及兒童產品安全條例》（第424章）（《條例》）而進行的主動巡查次數（包括線上及線下）、（ii）接獲的舉報宗數及其詳情（包括在執法過程中檢獲的不合規格玩具名稱及其危險性質）、（iii）向零售商和批發商發出的禁制通知書數字，以及（iv）因觸犯《條例》而被定罪的個案宗數和每宗個案的刑罰為何；

（二）有否透過學校和急症室求診數目等渠道作出統計，過去五年，每年本港兒童因不慎使用玩具而引致窒息、急性中毒及受傷的個案宗數；如有，每宗個案的詳情（包括涉事兒童的年齡、該玩具的名稱及有否被列入海關「不安全產品案例」名單（該名單），以及海關的跟進行動）為何；如否，會否考慮建立通報機制，以確保所有持份者（尤其是家長及教師）及時知悉涉及重大社會利益及兒童安全的玩具安全事件；

（三）鑑於根據消費者委員會在二○一九年八月發布的測試報告，12款「鬼口水」或黏土玩具的硼遷移量超出歐洲標準建議上限，若長時間接觸或間接過量攝取該物質或會引致嘔吐甚至影響生育能力，自該報告發布後，當局有否禁止相關帶有健康風險的玩具在港銷售；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）據悉去年美國消費品安全委員會擬對水珠玩具實施更嚴格的規管，而目前市民仍可從線上或線下渠道購入該等水珠玩具及其他載列於該名單的玩具，當局會否考慮加強對相關產品的安全規管，以及禁止部分曾於海外引發致命意外的玩具在港銷售；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府十分重視確保玩具和兒童產品的安全，並根據《玩具及兒童產品安全條例》（《條例》）（第424章），對製造、進口或供應本港使用的玩具和兒童產品的安全作出規管。

《條例》訂明，任何人不得製造、進口或供應任何玩具，除非該玩具符合《條例》附表1所指明的其中一套安全標準（均為國際標準或主要經濟體採用的標準）內全部適用於該玩具的規定。違反以上條文的人士首次定罪最高可判處監禁一年及罰款10萬元，其後各次定罪最高可判處監禁兩年及罰款50萬元。

政府一直留意有關安全標準的修訂，以更新適用於在香港供應的玩具和兒童產品的標準。

另外，《玩具及兒童產品安全（附加安全標準或規定）規例》（《規例》）訂明在本港供應的玩具，必須符合《規例》的規定，包括須附有識別標記（即製造商、進口商或供應商的名稱和地址）及適用於該玩具的雙語警示或警告（即其安全存放、使用、耗用或處置的任何警示或警告）等資料；以及須符合玩具所含塑化劑的濃度規定。

作為《條例》的執法機關，香港海關（海關）主動在市面和網購平台上進行巡查，經風險評估後試購各類型的玩具和兒童產品，交給政府化驗所進行安全測試。另外，海關會對接獲的投訴及相關政府部門或機構的轉介個案作出調查，因應事實和證據採取適當的執法行動，並且積極跟進從不同來源所得的有關懷疑不安全玩具及兒童產品的資料，包括傳媒報道、內地或海外個別玩具和兒童產品所採取的措施，以及境外執法機關和產品安全組織發布的產品安全消息等。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢海關後，現回覆如下：

（一）由二○二○年至二○二四年，海關共接獲68宗關於玩具的投訴，進行共超過7 920次巡查及特別抽查，並就127宗個案立案調查。在上述期間，海關向14宗個案的涉事人或公司提出檢控，全部被告（包括六間公司和八個人）均被定罪，法庭判處罰款金額由3,000至32,000元不等，涉及的玩具種類包括燈籠、螢光棒、心型螢光玩具、彈射玩具、拼圖玩具、膨脹珠玩具、擠壓玩具、磁石玩具、拼接地墊、吹泡泡玩具及玩具咪高峰。此外，海關發出了32份禁制通知書，禁止有關人士在指定期間內供應相信為不安全的產品，以及94封書面警告。與此同時，海關亦在邊境管制站進行了45次突擊檢查，打擊不安全的玩具和兒童產品進口香港。按年份分類的相關數字表列於附件。

（二）現時，海關沒有透過學校和急症室求診數目等渠道就兒童因使用不安全玩具而引致受傷的個案作出統計。就相關政府部門或機構轉介的個案，海關會適時作出跟進調查。

一直以來，海關十分重視並透過多個渠道，向市民和商戶發放有關玩具安全的信息，包括：


如在調查過程中發現有安全問題的玩具，即時發放新聞公報，並在調查完成後把相關資訊列入海關網頁內的「不安全產品案例」中；




致力向商戶作出合規推廣，協助商戶了解《條例》有關玩具安全的要求；及




與衞生署一起舉辦有關玩具安全的公眾講座，並到學校向學生和家長舉辦講座，派發有關《條例》的小冊子，以及介紹和分享玩具安全的資訊。


海關沒有計劃設立特定的通報機制。

（三）就消費者委員會在二○一九年八月發布的測試報告中，有「鬼口水」或黏土玩具的檢測樣本的硼遷移量超出歐洲標準建議的上限，海關接獲轉介後隨即在各區巡查，在市面發現並試購四款不同品牌的「鬼口水」或黏土玩具作安全測試，測試結果顯示所有樣本均符合《條例》內訂明的安全標準。但海關發現其中一款「鬼口水」玩具未能符合識別標記及雙語警示或警告的要求，涉嫌違反《條例》的規定，於是採取了執法行動，向涉案的零售商發出書面警告。

（四）根據《條例》，製造商、進口商及供應商在供應水珠玩具時，須符合《條例》附表1所指明的三套玩具標準（即國際標準ISO 8124、歐洲標準BS EN 71和美國材料及試驗學會標準ASTM F963）中任何一套標準內全部適用於該玩具的規定。

海關留意到美國消費品安全委員會擬對水珠玩具實施更嚴格的規管，但相關更嚴格的規管並未立法。政府會繼續密切留意境外執法機構和產品安全組織就玩具產品安全標準的最新要求，適時更新或修訂《條例》的附表。

現時，就懷疑不安全的水珠玩具，海關一直在各區進行巡查及試購作安全測試，以確保進口及在本地供應的玩具達到合理的安全程度。由二○二○年至二○二四年，海關就水珠玩具進行共29次巡查或特別抽查，接獲三宗關於水珠玩具的投訴，並就兩宗個案立案調查。其中一宗個案涉及水珠玩具的膨脹幅度超出安全標準並欠缺識別標記和雙語警告標籤，涉事人被法庭判處罰款。另一宗個案涉及欠缺識別標記及雙語警示或警告的水珠玩具，海關向涉事公司發出書面警告。"
LCQ22: Toys safety,2025-07-16 16:40,2025-07-16 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600590.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon Chow Man-kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

It has been reported that certain toys (e.g. slime, powerful magnetic beads and toy aqua beads, etc.) pose potential safety hazards. For instance, in 2023, there were 6 000 cases of children seeking emergency medical treatment in the United States (US) due to the inadvertent use of toy aqua beads, and there was even a 10-month-old infant found dead as a result. In Hong Kong, there are also numerous cases in which the unsafe toys have endangered children's health. Regarding toys safety, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) in each of the past five years, of the number of (i) proactive inspections (both online and offline) conducted by the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) for the purpose of enforcing the Toys and Children's Products Safety Ordinance (Cap. 424) (the Ordinance), (ii) reports received and their details (including the names of the substandard toys seized in enforcement actions and their hazardous nature), (iii) prohibition notices served on retailers and wholesalers, and (iv) cases of conviction for contravening the Ordinance and the penalty imposed in each of such cases;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics, through channels such as schools and the number of visits to accident and emergency departments, on the number of cases involving Hong Kong children suffering from suffocation, acute toxicity and injury due to the inadvertent use of toys in each of the past five years; if so, of the details of each case (including the age of the children involved, the names of toys and whether they have been put on the C&ED's list concerning ""cases of unsafe products"" (""the list""), as well as the follow-up actions taken by the C&ED; if not, whether it will consider establishing a notification mechanism to ensure that all the stakeholders (especially parents and teachers) will stay timely informed of toy safety incidents which involve significant social interests and children's safety;

(3) given that according to a test report published by the Consumer Council in August 2019, the boron migration of 12 models of slime or putty toys exceeded the recommended upper limit of the European standard, and prolonged exposure to or indirect excessive intake of the substance may result in vomiting or even affect one's fertility, whether the authorities have prohibited the local sale of relevant toys associated with health risks since the publication of the report; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) it is learnt that the US Consumer Product Safety Commission intended to impose more stringent regulation on toy aqua beads last year, and members of the public can still purchase such toy aqua beads and other toys on the list through online or offline channels at present, whether the authorities will consider stepping up the regulation of the safety of relevant products as well as banning local sale of certain toys which have caused fatal accidents overseas; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply

President,

 The Government attaches great importance to ensuring the safety of toys and children's products and regulates the safety of toys and children's products which are manufactured, imported or supplied for local consumption, in accordance with the Toys and Children's Products Safety Ordinance (the Ordinance) (Cap. 424).

 The Ordinance stipulates that a person must not manufacture, import or supply a toy unless the toy complies with all the applicable requirements contained in one of the toy standards (which are international standards or standards adopted by major economies) specified in Schedule 1 to the Ordinance. A person who contravenes the above provision is liable to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for one year and a fine of $100,000 on first conviction and is liable to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years and a fine of $500,000 on subsequent conviction.

 The Government keeps in view any amendments to the relevant safety standards so as to update the standards applicable to the toys and children's products supplied in Hong Kong.

 Moreover, the Toys and Children's Products Safety (Additional Safety Standards or Requirements) Regulation (the Regulation) stipulates that a toy supplied in Hong Kong must comply with the requirements including the carrying of identification markings (i.e. the full name and address of the manufacturer, importer or supplier) and the bilingual warnings or cautions (with respect to the safe keeping, use, consumption or disposal) applicable to the toy; and the compliance with the requirements on concentration of phthalates contained in a toy.

 As the enforcement agency of the Ordinance, the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) proactively conducts surveillance in the market and online shopping platforms. Having conducted risk assessment, the C&ED will test-purchase different types of toys and children's products and pass them to the Government Laboratory for safety tests. Besides, the C&ED will conduct investigations into the complaints received and the cases referred from relevant government departments or organisations and take appropriate enforcement actions based on facts and evidence. In addition, the C&ED will actively follow up information about suspected unsafe toys and children's products obtained from different sources such as media coverage and measures taken by the Mainland or overseas places against certain toys and children's products; and the news about product safety issued by law enforcement agencies and institutions of product safety outside Hong Kong.

Having consulted the C&ED, our reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) From 2020 to 2024, the C&ED received 68 complaints in relation to toys, conducted more than 7 920 surveillance visits or spot checks and investigated 127 cases. During the above period, the C&ED prosecuted individuals or companies involved in 14 cases. All defendants, including eight persons and six companies, were convicted and fined by the court, with the amount ranging from $3,000 to $32,000. The toys involved in these cases were lanterns, glow sticks, heart-shaped fluorescent toys, projectile toys, puzzle toys, expanding bead toys, squeeze toys, magnetic toys, joint mats, bubble toys and microphone toys. Furthermore, the C&ED issued 32 prohibition notices to prohibit related persons from supplying products that were believed to be unsafe for a specified period of time; and issued 94 warning letters. Meanwhile, the C&ED also conducted 45 blitz checks at boundary control points to combat the import of unsafe toys and children's products into Hong Kong. The relevant figures categorised by year are listed in the table in the Annex.

(2) Currently, the C&ED did not compile statistics on cases involving children suffering injuries resulting from the use of unsafe toys through channels such as schools or the number of visits to accident and emergency departments. For cases referred by the relevant government departments or organisations, the C&ED will conduct follow-up investigations as and when appropriate.

All along, the C&ED has attached great importance to disseminating information about toys safety to the public and traders through various channels, including:


if any toys with safety issues are identified during investigations, a press statement will be published immediately;and after completion of the investigation, the relevant information will be included in the ""cases of unsafe products"" in the C&ED's webpage;




striving to carry out compliance promotion for traders to assist the traders in understanding the relevant toy safety requirements of the Ordinance; and




organising with the Department of Health toys and children's products safety talks for the public and for students and parents in schools; and distributing pamphlets about the Ordinance, introducing and sharing safety information of toys and children's products.


 The C&ED has no plan to establish a specific notification mechanism.

(3)In the testing report published by the Consumer Council in August 2019, the boron migration level in some of the samples of slime or clay toy exceeded the suggested safety limit of the European Standard. Upon receiving the referral, the C&ED immediately conducted surveillance visits in various districts and test-purchased four different brands of slime or clay toy from the market for safety testing. Test results showed that all the samples complied with the safety standards stipulated in the Ordinance. However, the C&ED found that one sample of slime failed to comply with the identification markings and bilingual warnings or cautions requirements and was suspected to be in contravention of the requirements of the Ordinance. Immediate enforcement action was taken against the retailer concerned and a written warning was subsequently issued to the said retailer.

(4)Under the Ordinance, manufacturers, importers, and suppliers of water-bead toys are required to ensure that their products comply with all the applicable requirements contained in one of the three toy safety standards specified in Schedule 1 to the Ordinance (i.e. the International Standard ISO 8124, the European Standard BS EN 71 and the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard ASTM F963).

 TheC&ED has noted that the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission is considering more stringent regulations for water-bead toys, although these more stringent regulations have not yet been implemented by law. The Government will continue to closely monitor any new requirements for toys safety standards from law enforcement agencies and institutions of product safety outside Hong Kong, and will revise or update the Schedules to the Ordinance as and when appropriate.

At present, for water-bead toys suspected to be unsafe, the C&ED has actively conducted inspections and test-purchases in various districts to assess their safety, with a view to ensuring that both imported and locally supplied toys have reached a reasonable standard of safety. From 2020 to 2024, the C&ED conducted 29 inspections or targeted spot checks on water-bead toys, received three complaint cases related to water-bead toys and initiated two investigations. In one case, a person was fined in court for supplying water-bead toys exceeding the expandable limit of the safety standard and without bearing the identification markings and bilingual warnings or cautions. In another case, a written warning was issued to a company supplying water-bead toys without bearing the identification markings and bilingual warnings or cautions."

答覆：

主席：

本屆政府一直以結果為目標、以市民為中心，致力提供優質公共服務，同時推行深化改革，推出各項強化措施。根據本年六月發表的《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港的全球競爭力由去年的第五位躍升至全球第三；在政府效率方面，香港排名由世界第三上升至世界第二，顯示香港特別行政區（特區）政府的施政方向整體正確，各項政策取得成效，政府部門也高效運作，向市民、外地投資者、遊客等提供需要的服務。為確保公共服務的質素並且百尺竿頭，更進一步，我們非常珍視申訴專員公署（公署）和審計署的調查／審計報告和寶貴意見，各部門會詳細審視及研究有關的報告和跟進相關建議。

就簡慧敏議員的提問，經諮詢行政署和公署、財經事務及庫務局和審計署，以及政制及內地事務局後，現回覆如下：

（一）公署是根據《申訴專員條例》成立的獨立法定機構，負責處理行政失當的調查工作，不屬於政府部門亦不隸屬於特區政府。根據法例，申訴專員除了調查由申訴人士提出，有關政府部門及公營機構涉嫌行政失當的申訴外，亦有權就可能引致不公的行政失當，主動展開調查行動。觸發公署展開主動調查行動的問題，主要是牽涉重大的公眾利益的課題。

過去十年，公署共完成98項主動調查行動，所涉部門共有40個，當中涉獵的範圍廣泛，涵蓋醫療衞生、交通運輸、屋宇、地政、規劃、勞工、環境保護、食物及環境衞生、教育、社會福利、房屋、文化康體等多個範疇。公署一般每年完成八至十項主動調查行動。

其間，涉及公署主動調查行動次數最多的部門按序為食物環境衞生署（17次）、地政總署（13次）、房屋署（11次）、運輸署（9次）、環境保護署（8次）、民政事務總署（8次）、康樂及文化事務署（8次）。

公署進行的每項主動調查行動有其獨特性，過去十年，不曾有重複調查的個別項目，但公署曾就一些重大範疇當中的不同事宜進行不同的主動調查行動，例如公共房屋、樹木管理、滲水、殯葬服務等。

舉例而言，食物及環境衞生、地政、公共房屋、交通運輸及康體均為重大範疇，公署在食物及環境衞生範疇的主動調查事宜例子有泳池監管、新界豁免管制屋宇欠妥排污設施、售賣機出售熱存／冷存食物及非預先包裝飲品的規管、先人過世手續；在地政相關範疇的主動調查事宜例子包括土地違例發展執法行動；在公共房屋範疇的主動調查事宜例子有「長者住屋」、打擊濫用公屋、收回、翻新及重新編配公屋單位、公共屋邨違例泊車；在交通運輸範疇的主動調查事宜例子有駕駛考試安排、路旁殘疾人士專用泊位；在康體範疇的主動調查事宜例子有單車租賃服務承辦商的單車阻塞通道、戶外遊樂和康樂設施的保養與維修等，公署便曾進行主動調查行動。

值得注意的是，部門或其職責範疇涉及公署主動調查行動次數多寡，可能與不同因素有關，例如服務性質、服務對象及當時的社會關注等，故受查次數並不代表部門的運作或表現情況。

另一方面，審計署進行衡工量值式審計，為政府部門及有關機構在履行職務時所達到的節省程度、效率和效益進行審查，相關審計結果會在審計署署長報告書中載述。

過去十年，審計署共完成174個衡工量值式審計項目，所涉政府部門（包括相關政策範疇的政策局）共有63個，涵蓋的範圍廣泛，包括工務、工商業、社會福利、屋宇、地政及規劃、康樂、文化及設施、教育、就業及勞工、運輸、環境保護等多個範疇。審計署一般每年完成十多個衡工量值式審計項目。

其間，所屬政策範疇被審計次數最多的部門按序為環境及生態局（27次）、發展局（18次）、教育局（16次）、文化體育及旅遊局（14次）、勞工及福利局（14次）、運輸及物流局（13次）、環境保護署（12次）、食物環境衞生署（12次）、康樂及文化事務署（12次）。

審計署曾於過去十年兩度審計「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」，涉及商務及經濟發展局和工業貿易署。審計結果分別於《審計署署長第八十四號報告書》第一章和《審計署署長第六十六號報告書》第七章發表。

審計署署長在揀選衡工量值式審計的項目和決定進行審計的先後次序時會考慮多個因素，包括項目的重要性、時間性、涉及的公帑及風險，以及所帶來的裨益等。

（二）未根據審計署或立法會政府帳目委員會（帳委會）的建議完成跟進工作的衡工量值式審計項目有42項，詳情見附件。政府一直以政府覆文和年度進展報告的方式，定期向立法會報告各項建議的落實進度，審計署每年亦會與帳委會討論受審核機構落實建議的進度。

（三）及（四）特區政府抱持積極求進的正面態度跟進公署和審計署的調查／審計報告和建議，仔細審研和吸納當中的建議以改善有關的政策措施和公共服務。誠如申訴專員七月八日在本會上解釋，部分政府部門負責較多與市民有密切接觸的服務，因而申訴可能會較多；亦正如上文所述，審計署署長在揀選衡工量值式審計的項目和決定進行審計的先後次序時會考慮項目的重要性、時間性、涉及的公帑及風險，以及所帶來的裨益等因素，因此不能單以公署調查和被揀選為審計項目的次數去衡量部門的表現。部分公署接到的申訴不涉及或只涉及輕微行政失當，公署也成功以調解方式處理了555宗這類申訴。對於公署及審計署完成調查／審計工作後發現部門在行政運作、行政體制、行政程序或在履行職務時所達到的節省程度、效率和效益有可改善之處，部門和政策局會致力跟進。導致部門行政失當、效率欠佳、資源未能善用等問題的原因眾多，也往往並不單一。對於一些比較深層次的問題，政府整體也十分注重，例如過分注重程序而忽略是否有效達到目標，本屆政府由上至下貫徹以結果為目標，由日常工作以至中高級公務員的領導才能培訓也注重這一元素。如在各項調查或審計中發現有公務員力有不逮或工作態度不夠積極，其上司會在有關公務員的考績報告中反映；若該公務員在被晉升委員會考慮之列，晉升委員會也會考慮他／她工作能力或態度上的缺失。如在調查或審計中發現有公務員有違紀違規的情況，部門會根據公務員的紀律機制處理。就政治委任官員而言，政府會按《政治委任制度官員守則》處理。

本屆政府致力落實賞罰分明制度的建設。在獎勵方面，政府一直致力透過各項公務員嘉獎計劃，包括「行政長官表揚榜」獎勵計劃、公務員事務局局長嘉許狀計劃、公務員優質服務獎勵計劃等，嘉許在不同範疇表現優秀的部門團隊或人員，鼓勵公務員積極奮進，竭誠為市民服務。至於公務員優質服務獎勵計劃旨在表揚服務卓越的政府部門及團隊，激勵公務員創新求進，推廣以民為本及「同一個政府」團隊合作的公共服務文化。公署也設有年度申訴專員嘉許獎，除了表揚對改善公共行政有貢獻的部門和公營機構，並會向公職人員頒發個人獎及團隊獎，表揚他們在服務市民方面的傑出表現和專業態度。

（五）公務員事務局在二○二三年九月頒布和實施根據《公務人員（管理）命令》（《命令》）第12條，為公眾利益着令工作表現持續欠佳公務員退休（第12條行動）的簡化機制（簡化機制），以加強管理工作表現欠佳的員工。自二○二三年九月至二○二五年六月底，共有16名人員因工作表現欠佳而獲發《命令》第12條通知書，告知該員須在指定觀察期內提升工作表現至可接受水平，否則當局將採取第12條行動；當中，三名人員因工作表現持續欠佳而被着令退休；二人於接獲通知書後辭職；二人的工作表現提升至可接受水平而第12條行動因此獲暫緩；另外九人的個案仍在進行中。相對在二○一八年九月至二○二三年九月（即實施簡化機制前）該五年期間共有12名人員獲部門管方根據舊機制向其發出通知書告知將採取第12條行動，平均每年2.4人；簡化機制實施以來，已有16名人員獲發通知書，明顯獲部門採用得更多；而個案的平均處理時間亦由實施簡化機制前該五年期間的31.5個月大幅縮短至簡化機制實施後的10個月。除該16名人員外，部分人員得知部門打算對他們進行第12條行動，在進入觀察期前已自行辭職，政府沒有備存有關個案數目的資料。在發放增薪點方面，在二○二三和二○二四年，分別有12名和21名公務員因工作表現欠佳而不獲增薪。

公務員是特區治理體系的重要部分。本屆政府一直重視優化公務員管理制度，去年更新的《公務員守則》列明績效問責是基本信念之一，公務員須為其履行公職時作出的決定和行動負責。我們會繼續推進有關工作。"
LCQ17: Monitoring operation of government departments and performance of civil servants,2025-07-16 16:05,2025-07-16 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600299.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Carmen Kan and a written reply by the Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

  Regarding the monitoring of the operation of government departments and the performance of civil servants, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the following information in respect of the investigations/audits conducted by the Office of The Ombudsman and the Audit Commission (Audit) since 2015 (set out in a table):

(i) the subjects and names of government departments involved in the investigation reports/audit reports completed each year; and
(ii) the number of investigations/audits conducted on various government departments, and the subjects on which investigations/audits had been conducted repeatedly (set out by department and year);

(2) whether it knows which of the subjects examined by Audit mentioned in (1) have not yet completed the follow-up work in accordance with the recommendations of Audit and the Public Accounts Committee of this Council;

(3) of the measures put in place by the Government to improve the operation of government departments which have been investigated/examined repeatedly and found to have problems; whether it has held the then responsible personnel (including accountability officials and civil servants) responsible and imposed punishments; if so, of the details, including the number of the relevant personnel being punished (with a breakdown by the investigated/examined subjects and government departments) and the form of penalty imposed; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will study the establishment of the relevant mechanism;

(4) whether the authorities have put in place an incentive mechanism for government departments with outstanding performance, so as to further increase the incentive of government personnel; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether they will study establishing the relevant mechanism; and

(5) since the promulgation of the updated Civil Service Code (the Code) last year, of the number of civil servants who have been issued with notifications by the Government under section 12 of the Public Service (Administration) Order and not granted increments as a result of substandard performance (with a breakdown by rank), and how such number compares with the data before the Code was updated; of the measures in place to enhance the effectiveness of rewarding and punishing civil servants for their performance, e.g. whether it will study reforming the incremental point system to improve their overall performance; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The current-term Government has all along been result-oriented and citizen-centered, striving to provide quality public services, while at the same time deepening reforms and introducing various enhancement measures. According to the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 published in June this year, Hong Kong's global competitiveness rises from the fifth place last year to the third. In terms of government efficiency, Hong Kong's ranking rises from the third to the second place globally, indicating that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's policies are working, various policies have yielded results, and that Government departments are also operating highly effectively in providing the requisite services for the public, foreign investors and tourists, etc. To ensure that the quality of public services is maintained and further enhanced, we attach great importance to the investigation/audit reports and valuable advice provided by the Office of The Ombudsman (OMB) and the Audit Commission. Respective departments will examine and study the reports in detail and follow up on the relevant recommendations.

  Having consulted the Administration Wing and the OMB, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Audit Commission, as well as the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, my reply to the question raised by the Hon Carmen Kan is as follows:

(1) Established under The Ombudsman Ordinance, the OMB is an independent statutory body responsible for investigation works on maladministration. It is not a government department nor an organisation under theHKSAR Government. Under the legislation, apart from investigating complaints lodged by complainants against alleged maladministration in government departments and public organisations, The Ombudsman is also empowered to initiate direct investigation operations where injustice may have been caused by maladministration. The direct investigation operations are prompted mainly by subjects of significant public interest.

  Over the past decade, the OMB has completed a total of 98 direct investigation operations involving 40 departments, covering a wide range of areas including medical and health, transport, buildings, lands, planning, labour, environmental protection, food and environmental hygiene, education, social welfare, housing, culture, recreation and sports. In general, the OMB completes eight to ten direct investigation operations per year.

  During this period, the departments involved in the highest number of direct investigation operations were, in descending order, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (17 operations), the Lands Department (13 operations), the Housing Department (11 operations), the Transport Department (9 operations), the Environmental Protection Department (8 operations), the Home Affairs Department (8 operations), and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (8 operations).

  Each direct investigation operation has its own uniqueness. In the past decade, none of the direct investigation operations were repeated. However, the OMB has carried out different direct investigation operations on different topics under some major areas, such as public housing, tree management, water seepage, after-death arrangement.

  For instance, food and environmental hygiene, lands matters, public housing, transport and recreation and sports are major areas. Examples of direct investigations conducted by the OMB in the area of food and environmental hygiene include regulation of swimming pools, enforcement against defective sewage works of New Territories exempted houses, regulation over sale of food in hot/cold holding and non-pre-packaged beverages by means of vending machine, after-death arrangements; an example of direct investigations in the area of lands matters is enforcement against unauthorised land developments; direct investigation examples in relation to public housing include housing for senior citizens, combating abuse, recovery, refurbishment and reallocation of public housing, illegal parking in public housing estates; examples in the area of traffic and transport include arrangements for driving tests, on-street parking spaces designated for people with disabilities; examples in relation to recreation and sports include obstruction of passageways by bicycles owned by operators of bicycle rental services, as well as repairs and maintenance of outdoor recreational and sports facilities. The OMB has conducted direct investigation operations on such topics.

  It is worth noting that the frequency of the departments or their subject areas being involved in direct investigation operations might be affected by various factors including nature of service, service target and prevailing concern in the society. Therefore, the frequency of departments under investigation does not represent the operation situation or performance of the department.

  On the other hand, value for money audits are conducted by the Audit Commission to examine the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which government departments and organisations have discharged their functions, and the results of such audits are published in the Director of Audit's Reports.

  In the past ten years, the Audit Commission completed a total of 174 value for money audits covering 63 government departments (including the relevant policy bureaux), covering a wide range of areas including public works, commerce and industry, social welfare, buildings, lands and planning, recreation, culture and facilities, education, employment and labour, transportation and environmental protection. In general, the Audit Commission completes over ten value for money audits per year.

  During the period, the departments involved in the highest number of audits in their respective policy areas were, in descending order, the Environment and Ecology Bureau (27 audits), the Development Bureau (18 audits), the Education Bureau (16 audits), the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (14 audits), the Labour and Welfare Bureau (14 audits), the Transport and Logistics Bureau (13 audits), the Environmental Protection Department (12 audits), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (12 audits), and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (12 audits).

  In the past ten years, the Audit Commission conducted two audits on the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales, involving the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Trade and Industry Department. The audit findings were published in Chapter 1 of the Director of Audit's Report No. 84 and Chapter 7 of the Director of Audit's Report No. 66 respectively.

  The Director of Audit takes into account a number of factors, including the significance of the project, its timeliness, the amount of public money and risks involved, and the benefits to be brought about, in selecting the subjects for value for money audits and deciding on the priority for conducting the audits.

(2) The number of value for money audits for which follow-up actions have not been completed in accordance with the recommendations of the Audit Commission or the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Legislative Council (LegCo) is 42, as set out in Annex. The Government has been reporting regularly to LegCo on the progress of implementing the recommendations in the form of Government Minute and annual progress reports, and the Audit Commission discusses with the PAC annually the progress of implementation of the recommendations by the audited organisations.

(3) and (4) The HKSAR Government adopts a proactive and positive attitude in following up the investigations of the OMB and the audit reports of the Audit Commission as well as the recommendations therein, and carefully scrutinises and takes on board the recommendations to improve the relevant policy measures and public services. As the Ombudsman explained to this Council at its meeting on July 8, some government departments are responsible for more services which are in close contact with the public, and hence they may receive more complaints, and as mentioned above, the Director of Audit will take into account factors such as the significance of the subject, its timeliness, the amount of public funds and risks involved, as well as the benefits to be brought about, in selecting the value for money audit subjects and in determining the priority for conducting the audit; therefore, a department's performance cannot be measured solely on the basis of the number of investigations conducted by the OMB and the number of projects selected for audit. Some of the complaints received by the OMB involved no or only minor maladministration, and the OMB has successfully concluded 555 such cases by way of mediation. Departments and bureaux will strive to follow up on any areas of improvement in the economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the administrative operations, administrative systems, administrative procedures or in the discharge of duties identified by the OMB and the Audit Commission upon completion of their investigations/audits. The causes of departmental maladministration, inefficiency and ineffective use of resources are numerous and often not homogeneous. The Government as a whole also pays close attention to deep-seated issues, such as over-emphasis on procedures to the detriment of effective achievement of objectives. The current-term Government adopts a result-oriented approach at all levels, and this element is emphasised in our daily work as well as in the leadership training of senior and middle-level civil servants. If a civil servant is found to be incapable of performing his/her duties or to have a less than positive attitude towards his/her work in any of the investigations or audits, his/her supervisors will reflect this in his/her appraisal report, and if he/she is under consideration by a promotion board, the board will also take into account deficiencies in his/her ability or attitude towards work. If an investigation or audit reveals that a civil servant has misconducted himself/herself, the department will deal with the case in accordance with the civil service disciplinary mechanism. As regards politically appointed officials, the Government will act in accordance with the Code for Officials under the Political Appointment System.

  The current-term Government is committed to setting up a performance-based management system. In respect of awards, the Government endeavours to implement various commendation schemes for civil servants, including the Chief Executive's Award for Exemplary Performance, the Secretary for the Civil Service's Commendation Award Scheme, the Civil Service Outstanding Service Award Scheme, to give due recognition to departments and individuals with outstanding performances in different areas, encourage civil servants to strive for excellence and provide quality services to the public. The Civil Service Outstanding Service Award Scheme aims to recognise government departments and teams in providing exemplary services, encourage civil servants' innovation, and promote a people-oriented and ""one government"" public service culture. The OMB has also set up an annual Ombudsman's Awards Scheme to recognise the contribution of departments and public organisations to the improvement of public administration. Individual and team awards are also presented to public officers in recognition of their outstanding performance and professionalism in serving the public.

(5) In September 2023, the Civil Service Bureau promulgated and implemented the streamlined mechanism of retiring civil servants in the public interest on the ground of persistent sub-standard performance (the streamlined mechanism) under Section 12 of the Public Service (Administration) Order (Section 12 action) to strengthen the management of staff with sub-standard performance. From September 2023 to the end of June 2025, a total of 16 officers were issued with Section 12 Notification due to their sub-standard performance. They were advised to improve their performance to the acceptable standard within a specified observation period; otherwise Section 12 action would be taken. Among these officers, three officers were ordered to be retired due to persistent sub-standard performance; two officers resigned upon receipt of the Section 12 Notification; two officers with Section 12 action suspended as their performance was improved to the acceptable standard; and the cases of nine officers are still ongoing. When compared to the five–year period from September 2018 to September 2023 (i.e. before the implementation of the streamlined mechanism) in which a total of 12 officers were issued with the notification under the old mechanism informing that Section 12 action would be taken (i.e. 2.4 officers per year on average), 16 officers have been issued with Section 12 Notification since the implementation of the streamlined mechanism, indicating a higher usage of the streamlined mechanism by departments. The average processing time has also been largely reduced from 31.5 months for cases processed within the five years before the implementation of the streamlined mechanism to 10 months after its implementation. Apart from the 16 officers mentioned above, some officers have resigned before the commencement of the observation period when they were informed of the department's intention to initiate Section 12 action against them, and the Government does not keep information on the number of such cases. As regards the granting of increments, a total of 12 and 21 civil servants were not granted an increment due to unsatisfactory performance in 2023 and 2024 respectively.

  The civil service is an integral part of the HKSAR's governance system. The current-term Government has been attaching great importance to the enhancement of the civil service management system. The Civil Service Code updated last year states that accountability for performance is one of the core values, and that civil servants should be held accountable for their decisions and actions in discharging their public duties. We will continue to push ahead with the relevant work."

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-07-16 15:45,2025-07-16 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600588.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 15 to noon today (July 16), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 222 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

數據顯示，過去五年香港中藥材進出口貿易數值及數量呈下跌趨勢，進口量值累計下跌近28%，整體出口量值累計下降近20%。據中藥業界反映，下跌趨勢源於全球中藥材採購模式改變，採購者更傾向直接從產地購買藥材，以確保供應穩定並節省成本，因此影響香港的轉口量。此外，中藥材成本上漲亦可能導致本地中藥材的需求減少，繼而影響中藥材市場交易數量。

在中成藥註冊方面，根據《中醫藥條例》（第549章），所有中成藥必須經香港中醫藥管理委員會（管委會）轄下中藥組註冊，方可在香港銷售、進口或管有。中成藥註冊須符合中藥組就安全、品質及成效三方面的嚴格要求。根據紀錄，在二○二○年至二○二四年期間，管委會中藥組每年接獲與中成藥註冊申請有關的申請數目、獲發及不獲發出「中成藥註冊證明書」（「證明書」）的個案數目表列如下：

根據國家藥品監督管理局官方網頁，截至二○二五年六月三十日，共有16款香港傳統外用中成藥已透過簡化審批流程獲批准在內地上市，至今未有港澳已上市傳統口服中成藥透過簡化審批流程在內地註冊。有關香港中成藥在海外國家註冊上市的數據，衞生署沒有備存相關紀錄。

政府一直通過不同方式推動中醫藥國際化及發展香港成為中醫藥國際化的橋頭堡。其中政府中藥檢測中心永久大樓（檢測中心）預期將於今年年底分階段投入服務，檢測中心將持續推動中藥標準化和國際化，透過技術轉移加強中藥業界對其產品的品質控制，憑藉香港在內地和海外的良好信譽，透過建立香港中藥品牌及標準，推動中醫藥國際化。

在規管制度方面，隨着中成藥過渡性註冊制度已於今年六月三十日屆滿，所有在港銷售中成藥均須持有有效的正式註冊（即「證明書」），標誌着在香港中醫藥監管體系踏入新階段，所有在港銷售的中成藥均已嚴格符合安全、品質及成效三項核心註冊要求，並充分滿足《中醫藥條例》對藥品包裝及說明的規範。中成藥註冊制度的全面實施除進一步加強對市民健康的保障，更大大加強了國際對香港中藥監管體系的信心，有助本港的註冊中成藥「走出去」，鞏固香港作為中醫藥國際化重要樞紐的戰略地位。

 此外，政府亦鼓勵中藥商善用中醫藥發展基金及其他貿易支援措施。為配合國家簡化港澳註冊傳統外用中成藥審批流程的政策，基金於二○二四年二月增設粵港澳大灣區中成藥產業發展支援計劃（A5計劃），協助香港中成藥製造商或批發商開拓內地市場，至今已累計批出12個申請。醫務衞生局將適時進一步擴闊該支援計劃的適用範圍以配合於今年發布將簡化審批流程擴展至口服中成藥的最新政策方向。同時，不同平台亦提供資源和支援予業界加強品牌推廣及拓展營銷，例如「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）、「中小企業市場推廣基金」及參與香港貿易發展局與業界合辦的「國際現代化中醫藥及健康產品會議」等，以擴展香港境外市場，加強國際交流及探索合作貿易機遇。

政府會繼續全力發揮香港聯通世界的窗口作用，進一步強化香港作為中醫藥國際化橋頭堡的角色，推動香港中醫藥高質量、高水平及全方位發展。

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Census and Statistics Department and the Department of Health, the consolidated reply is provided by the Health Bureau as follows:

  According to the statistics from the Census and Statistics Department, the quantity and value of imports and total exports of Chinese herbal medicines (Chms) (Note 1) of Hong Kong during the period of 2020 to 2024 are tabulated as follows:




Year

  The figures indicate that the value and quantity of imports and total exports of Chms of Hong Kong have exhibited a downward trend over the past five years, with a cumulative drop of nearly 28 per cent and 20 per cent in volume of imports and total exports respectively. The Chinese medicines (CMs) industry relayed that such downward trend is mainly attributable to changes in global procurement practice of Chms, as purchasers prefer sourcing Chms directly from places of origin to ensure stable supply and reduce cost, thus affecting the volume of intermediary trade in Hong Kong. In addition, rising costs of Chms may have led to reduced local demand, thereby impacting the overall transaction quantity in the Chms market.

  Regarding registration of proprietary Chinese medicines (pCm), under the Chinese Medicine Ordinance (Cap. 549), all pCm must be registered with the Chinese Medicines Board (CMB) under the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong (CMCHK) before they can be sold, imported or possessed in Hong Kong. For a pCm to be registered, it must fulfill the stringent safety, quality and efficacy requirements set out by CMB. According to records, during the period of 2020 to 2024, annual figures received by the CMB under the CMCHK related to pCm registration applications, and the number of cases granted or not granted for a ""Certificate of Registration of a pCm"" (HKC) are tabulated below:

  According to the official website of the National Medical Products Administration, as of June 30, 2025, a total of 16 Hong Kong-registered traditional pCms for external use have been approved for marketing in the Mainland through the streamlined approval procedure. Currently, no Hong Kong- and Macao- registered traditional pCms for oral use has been registered in the Mainland through the streamlined approval procedure. Regarding registration and marketing data for Hong Kong-registered pCms in overseas countries, the Department of Health does not maintain relevant records.

  The Government has all along been promoting the internationalisation of Chinese medicine (CM) and developing Hong Kong into a bridgehead for the internationalisation of CM through various initiatives. The permanent premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI) is expected to be commissioned in phases starting from the end of this year. The GCMTI will continue to promote the standardisation and internationalisation of CMs and strengthen the quality control of CMs industry on its products through technology transfer. By leveraging Hong Kong's strong reputation in the Mainland and overseas, and by establishing the brand image and standards of CMs in Hong Kong, the GCMTI promotes internationalisation of CM.

  Regarding regulation, with the conclusion of the transitional registration system for pCm on June 30, 2025, all pCms sold in Hong Kong must hold valid formal registration (i.e. HKC). This milestone marks a new era in the regulatory regime of CM in Hong Kong, signifying that all pCms sold in Hong Kong have strictly complied with the three core registration requirements, namely safety, quality and efficacy, and fully satisfied the requirements of the Chinese Medicine Ordinance in respect of packaging and labelling. The full implementation of the pCm registration system not solely enhances the protection of public health, but also significantly strengthens international confidence in regulatory regime for CMs in Hong Kong. This would facilitate local registered pCms to go global, and consolidate the strategic position of Hong Kong as an essential hub for the internationalisation of CM.

  In addition, the Government also encourages CMs traders to make good use of the Chinese Medicine Development Fund (CMDF) and other trade supporting measures. To align with the national policy on streamlining the approval procedures for Hong Kong- and Macao- registered traditional pCms for external use, the CMDF launched the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area pCm Industry Development Support Scheme (A5 Scheme) in February 2024 to assist Hong Kong pCm manufacturers or wholesalers to explore the Mainland market. To date, a total of 12 applications have been approved. The Health Bureau will further expand the scope of the A5 Scheme in a timely manner in light of the latest policy directives of extending the scope of the streamlined approval procedures to pCms for oral use. In parallel, various platforms also provide resources and support to the industry to strengthen brand promotion and business development, including the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund), the SME Export Marketing Fund, and participation in the International Conference of the Modernization of Chinese Medicine and Health Products, which is jointly organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the industry, with a view to expanding their markets outside Hong Kong, strengthening international exchanges, and exploring co-operative trade opportunities.

  The Government will continue to fully leverage the role of Hong Kong as a gateway connecting the world, and further strengthen the role of Hong Kong as a bridgehead for internationalisation of CM, thereby promoting the high-quality and high-standard development of CM in Hong Kong on all fronts.

Note 1: Chms refers to dried or processed forms of herbal medicine specified in Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 of the Chinese Medicine Ordinance.

Note 2ï¼Including new applications for a HKC, conversion cases from a ""Notice of confirmation of transitional registration of pCm"" to a HKC, and renewal cases for a HKC.

Note 3ï¼The actual processing time for a pCm registration application is subject to the completeness of documentation submitted by the applicant, the complexity of different application categories, and the current caseload of the CMCHK Secretariat. Depending on the submission time and circumstances of each application, the processing of an application may extend beyond the calendar year of initial submission."
LCQ10: Procedures for healthcare personnel to compile and modify medical records,2025-07-16 15:30,2025-07-16 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600390.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

  It has been reported that several medical incidents involving the subsequent modification of medical records have previously occurred in public hospitals, sparking controversy (e.g. a medical incident at Queen Mary Hospital in 2020 where a girl was suspected to have gone into a vegetative state due to delayed blood transfusion, which involved doctors modifying the medical records after surgery, and the family considered that the relevant contents had a critical impact on understanding the incident's circumstances). There are views that under the existing mechanism, there is no effective procedure to ensure the necessity and legitimacy of modifying medical records, which lacks protection for both healthcare personnel and patients. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows, among the complaints received by the Hospital Authority (HA) in the past five years, the respective numbers of complaints involving the procedures for compiling medical records, the accuracy of the contents of records and the subsequent modification of the contents of medical records;

(2) whether it knows if HA has currently formulated relevant guidelines on the procedures and conditions for healthcare personnel to compile medical records and modify their contents; if HA has, of the details, and whether it has plans to improve such guidelines;

(3) whether it knows, with respect to modifications made by healthcare personnel to the contents of the complied medical records, if HA currently has a mechanism in place to verify the accuracy of the modified contents; if HA has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that and the difficulties involved;

(4) as there are views pointing out that in the past, a single doctor was responsible for recording medical procedures and confirming all surgical steps in some surgeries, which might affect the accuracy of the records, whether the Government knows if HA will consider amending the relevant procedures to require two or more healthcare personnel to be responsible for recording and confirming, so as to avoid unnecessary disputes; if HA will, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) whether it knows if HA will consider introducing different tools to record surgical procedures (e.g. making audio or video recordings with patients' consent) to protect both healthcare personnel and patients and reduce disputes; if HA will, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Hospital Authority (HA), our consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan is as follows:

  Healthcare personnel must comply with the relevant guidelines issued by their respective professional bodies, such as the Code of Professional Conduct issued by the Medical Council of Hong Kong. Besides, for the compilation and amendment of the medical records, healthcare personnel should also follow the requirements set forth in the HA's Clinical Data Policy Manual and Manual of Good Practices in Medical Records Management.

  When compiling medical records, healthcare personnel, including doctors, must always uphold their professional ethics and are responsible for maintaining systematic, true, adequate, clear, and contemporaneous medical records. Given that healthcare personnel must prioritise the patient's clinical condition during treatments like surgeries, detailed real-time documentation may not always be feasible. To ensure the accuracy of medical records, healthcare personnel may from time to time need to compile, amend or supplement medical records subsequently. The HA has also in place mechanism for subsequent amendment of medical records. In cases where relevant medical records should be amended or supplemented with details, the electronic medical record system will automatically log the time and specifics of all updates, while preserving the original records to ensure transparency and traceability of all amendments.

  The HA recognises the importance of accurately documenting surgical procedures to uphold patient safety and ensure transparency in healthcare. Currently, medical records are primarily compiled by the attending doctor based on the actual situation, and should be in line with the HA's clinical data policies and pertinent specialty guidelines. Subsequently, responsible healthcare personnel would upload these records to the clinical management system following verification and provision of electronic signature.

  In fact, the HA's practice of requiring the responsible healthcare personnel to compile and verify medical records is consistent with the standard practice in the medical sector (including professionals in the private sector). Comparing to the approach commonly adopted in the sector, the HA's current arrangements for managing medical records and recording subsequent amendments via the electronic clinical management system ensures a higher level of transparency and traceability.

  The HA is also proactively enhancing healthcare quality by, inter alia, incorporating medical equipment with recording capabilities and upgrading the electronic medical record system to facilitate maintaining medical image records. In instances where it is practically necessary (e.g., for clinical, educational, or research purposes) and practicable, the HA may record surgical procedures for future reference upon obtaining patient consent. Such arrangements must adhere strictly to patient privacy policies and data protection regulations, while ensuring that the recorded materials are utilised solely for specified purposes.

  Over the past five years, the number of complaints received by public hospitals concerning the issuance or content of medical records/reports/medical certificates is tabulated as follows:




Year 2020-21

Year 2022-23

  The HA does not maintain breakdown of complaints related to the medical record compilation procedures, the accuracy of record content, or subsequent amendments to medical records."
立法會十題：醫護人員撰寫及修改醫療紀錄的程序,2025-07-16 15:30,2025-07-16 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600409.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上陳凱欣議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

據報公立醫院以往曾發生數宗涉及醫療紀錄事後被修改的醫療事故，引起爭議（例如瑪麗醫院於二○二○年發生一宗懷疑女童因延誤輸血而變成植物人的醫療事故，當中涉及醫生在手術後修改醫療紀錄，而家屬認為相關內容對了解事故始末有關鍵性影響）。有意見認為現行機制下沒有有效程序確保修改醫療紀錄的必要性及正當性，對醫患雙方均沒有保障。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉在過去五年醫院管理局（醫管局）接獲的投訴個案中，涉及醫療紀錄撰寫程序、紀錄內容準確性，以及醫療紀錄內容被事後修改的投訴數目分別為何；

（二）是否知悉醫管局目前有否針對醫護人員撰寫及修改醫療紀錄內容的程序及條件制訂相關指引；如有，詳情為何，以及有否計劃完善該等指引；

（三）是否知悉就醫護人員修改已撰寫的醫療紀錄內容，現時醫管局有否機制核實修改內容的準確性；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因及所涉的困難為何；

（四）鑑於有意見指出以往部分手術由一名醫生負責記錄醫療程序及確認所有手術步驟，或會影響紀錄的準確性，政府是否知悉醫管局會否考慮修訂相關程序，規定須由兩名或以上醫護人員負責記錄和確認，以避免不必要爭議；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）是否知悉醫管局會否考慮引入不同工具記錄手術過程（例如在病人同意的情況下錄音或錄影），以保障醫患雙方並減少爭議；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳凱欣議員的提問，經諮詢醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

醫護人員須遵守其所屬專業團體的相關指引，例如由香港醫務委員會發出的《香港註冊醫生專業守則》。此外，在撰寫和修訂病歷紀錄方面，醫護人員亦必須按照醫管局《臨床資料政策手冊》和《良好醫療紀錄管理守則》載列的要求。

在撰寫醫療紀錄時，醫護人員（包括醫生）需時刻保持其專業操守，而且有責任備存有系統、真實、充分、清晰和能反映當時情況的醫療紀錄。由於在診治病人（如手術期間）時，醫護人員需先集中精力處理病人的臨床情況，未必能實時同步作詳盡記錄。為確保病歷紀錄的準確性，醫護人員不時有需要於事後填寫、修正或補充醫療紀錄。醫管局亦設有機制處理醫療紀錄的後續修訂。若相關紀錄需更正或補充細節，電子病歷系統會自動記錄所有更新的時間及內容，保留原先的紀錄，以確保修訂具透明度及可追溯性。

醫管局明白準確記錄手術過程對保障病人安全及醫療透明度的重要性。現時，醫療紀錄主要由負責醫生根據實際情況，並須符合醫管局的臨床資料政策和相關專科指引撰寫，負責醫護人員在確認及電子簽署後上載至臨床醫療管理系統。

事實上，醫管局由負責醫護人員撰寫及確認醫療紀錄的做法與醫療專業（包括私營界別內的專業人員）內的做法一致。相比行業內常見的做法，醫管局現時透過電子臨床醫療管理系統管理醫療紀錄並保存其後續修訂的安排已經確保較高程度的透明度及可追溯性。

醫管局同時積極提升醫療質素，包括引入附有錄影功能的醫療儀器及提升電子病歷系統以便利醫療圖像記錄。在有實際需要（例如臨床、教學或研究）及可行的情況下，取得病人同意後，醫管局可錄影手術過程，以供日後使用。有關安排須嚴格遵守病人私隱政策及資料保護條例，並確保錄影資料只作指定用途。

過去五年，公立醫院就醫療紀錄／報告／醫生證明書的發出或內容接獲的投訴個案數目如下︰

問題：

民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長於上月接受傳媒訪問時指出，區議會、地區「三會」（即分區委員會、地區撲滅罪行委員會及地區防火委員會）和地區服務及關愛隊伍（關愛隊）是地區治理的「三駕馬車」，三者分工清晰及高度結合。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）如何持續加強上述三者間的合作；

（二）鑑於民青局局長在上述訪問表示正檢討關愛隊的工作範疇，現時有關工作的進展為何；及

（三）會否參考內地和新加坡的地區治理經驗，持續提升在制度、政策和資源方面的支援，以為社區和居民提供更多關愛服務（例如在地區設立涵蓋各政府部門服務的「一窗式」政府中心）？

答覆：

主席：

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）在完善後的地區治理體系下，區議會擔當配合和支持政府的角色，協助政府收集民情民意、落實政策措施、回應市民訴求，以及推廣社區參與活動。地區「三會」（即分區委員會、地區撲滅罪行委員會及地區防火委員會）則就各自範疇，例如防火、滅罪等，向政府提出意見，並協助籌辦社區活動。地區服務及關愛隊伍（關愛隊）為政府領導的服務隊伍，以小區為本，為市民提供多元化關愛和支援服務，以及協助處理突發和緊急事故。民政事務專員作為區議會主席及「關愛隊」總指揮，負責帶領「三駕馬車」互相合作，發揮協同效應，為有需要的市民服務。

「三駕馬車」亦高度結合。由二○二四年四月起，政府委任全數現屆區議員為地區「三會」委員，以進一步加強地區三會與區議會的聯繫和協作。區議員亦不時與關愛隊合作，舉辦不同類型的地區活動，提升社區的凝聚力，讓關愛服務能深耕社區。各區民政事務處亦已設定機制，迅速動員和協調「三駕馬車」的成員，協助處理區內的突發和緊急事故。例如，在近日的皇后山邨和山麗苑食水事件，北區區議員、地區「三會」成員及關愛隊小隊在北區民政事務處統籌協調下，在一個周末完成超過1 500次探訪，並於各個主要位置設置街站，為居民提供最新用水資訊，以及登記居民求助並作轉介。

民政及青年事務局、民政事務總署及各區民政事務處會繼續加強協調和統籌區議會、地區「三會」、關愛隊及其他地區組織和團體與政府的合作，並持續檢視實際運作經驗和聆聽社會各界的意見，不斷優化有關合作機制，提升地區治理的效能。

（二）及（三）18區共452隊關愛隊於二○二三年第三季全面起動。自成立以來，關愛隊積極接觸和服務小區居民，除如上文所述迅速動員參與突發和緊急服務支援，關心受影響人士的需要外，亦為市民提供關愛服務，包括探訪或接觸長者戶及其他有需要住戶（例如劏房戶、長期病患者等），與他們建立聯繫，並為他們提供相關服務資訊、協助申請和預約公共服務；亦為有需要的人士提供家居或其他支援服務（例如簡單家居維修和清潔）。截至二○二五年六月底，關愛隊已合共探訪約530000萬個長者戶和其他有需要住戶，並提供約76000次簡單家居或其他支援服務；以及舉辦了約38000項地區活動，包括中醫義診、疫苗接種服務、情緒支援計劃、國家安全及國民教育活動等。在政策宣傳方面，關愛隊亦積極協助政府推廣不同政策，例如協助衞生署派發宣傳單張，向公衆傳遞有關預防疾病的資訊；與地區警民關係組合作，協助發放防騙資訊。此外，18區關愛隊亦參與社會福利署的「地區服務及關愛隊伍—支援長者及照顧者計劃」，透過探訪或接觸獨老和雙老住戶，以及護老者和殘疾人士照顧者，協助識別並將有需要個案轉介至相關社會福利單位跟進和轉介合資格的長者和殘疾人士安裝及使用「平安鐘」。

18區關愛隊的第一期服務協議將在今年九月至十月陸續完結。為更有效地展開下一期關愛隊的工作，我們正就關愛隊的安排及運作作出檢視。政府在規劃和推動地區工作時，一直秉持「以人為本、因地制宜」的原則。香港人口高度密集，社區結構多元，各區在人口特徵、地理環境、社會設施及居民需求等方面各有不同。因此，我們一方面參考內地及新加坡等地區治理經驗，亦要充分考慮香港各區的獨特性，按「區情區需」靈活調整服務模式。

二○二四年《施政報告》宣布恆常化關愛隊，並增加關愛隊下一期的資助金額五成，以支持關愛隊的工作。關愛隊會善用新增資源，在第一期計劃建立的地區網絡和關愛工作的基礎上，繼續鞏固和進一步推展地區關愛工作，讓各關愛隊小隊按其小區的「區情區需」，靈活務實把關愛工作做深做廣。展望將來，我們會繼續加強區議會、地區「三會」及關愛隊「三駕馬車」的協作機制，全面提升服務效能，持續提升市民的幸福感和獲得感。"
LCQ19: Promoting efficient district governance,2025-07-16 15:20,2025-07-16 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600248.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Chan Yung and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs pointed out during a media interview last month that the District Councils, ""the three district committees"" (i.e. the Area Committees, the District Fight Crime Committees and the District Fire Safety Committees) and the District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams) are the troika of district governance, with clear divisions of work and high levels of collaboration. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) how it will continue to strengthen co-operation among the aforesaid three parties;

(2) given that the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs mentioned in the aforesaid interview that the scope of work of the Care Teams is under review, of the current progress of the relevant work; and

(3) whether it will, by drawing on the district governance experiences of the Mainland and Singapore, continue to enhance support in terms of systems, policies and resources, so as to provide more care services for the communities and residents (such as establishing government centres in districts with single-window services from various government departments)?

Reply:

President,

 With regards to the member's question, our reply is as follows:

(1) Under the improved district governance system, the District Councils (DCs) play the role of complementing and supporting the Government, assisting the Government to gauge public opinions and local sentiments, implement policies and measures, and respond to public aspirations, as well as promoting community involvement activities. The ""three district committees"" (i.e. the Area Committees, the District Fight Crime Committees and the District Fire Safety Committees) offer advice to the Government according to their respective purviews (e.g. fire prevention, combat crime, etc), and help organise community activities. The District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams) are Government-led service teams working in sub-districts to provide people with a wide range of caring and support services, and assist in handling incidents and emergencies. District Officers, as DC Chairmen and Commanders of Care Teams, are responsible for leading the ""troika"" to collaborate with each other, achieve synergy and provide services to people in need.

The ""troika"" are highly integrated. Since April 2024, the Government appointed all incumbent DC members to be members of the ""three district committees"" with a view to strengthening the connection and collaboration between both sides. DC members also often work with Care Teams to organise various district activities to strengthen community cohesion and allow caring services to reach the community. Each District Office has also established a mechanism to swiftly mobilise and co-ordinate members of the ""troika"" to assist in handling incidents and emergencies within the district. For example, for the recent drinking water incidents at Queens' Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court, members of the North DC, members of the ""three district committees"" and Care Teams conducted over 1 500 home visits over a weekend, set up street booths at each key location to provide residents with the latest water information, and register residents' requests for assistance and make referrals.

The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Home Affairs Department and District Offices will continue to enhance co-ordination of the DCs, the ""three district committees"", Care Teams and other district organisations and groups to collaborate with the Government. We will also keep under review the actual operational experiences and listen to the views of different sectors to continuously improve the collaboration mechanism, so as to enhance the efficacy of district governance.

(2) and (3) Since the full launch of 452 Care Teams in 18 districts in the third quarter of 2023, Care Teams have been actively engaging and serving residents in the sub-districts. In addition to the swift mobilisation for incidents and emergency responses as mentioned above and caring for the needs of affected individuals, Care Teams also provide caring services to residents in the districts, including visiting or contacting elderly households and other households in need (e.g. households in subdivided flats and chronic patients, etc), establishing connections with them and providing relevant service information, assisting them in applying and setting up appointments for public services. Care Teams also offer home or other support services to those in need (e.g. basic home repairs and cleansing). As at end June 2025, Care Teams have visited about 530 000 elderly households and other households in need, provided about 76 000 times of basic home or other support services, and organised about 38 000 district-level activities, such as free Chinese medicine consultations, vaccination services, mental well-being support programmes, national security and civic education activities. In terms of promoting government policies, Care Teams have been proactively assisting the Government in promoting various policies, such as distributing promotional leaflets for the Department of Health to disseminate messages about disease prevention to the public, collaborating with district Police Community Relations Office to disseminate messages relating to fraud prevention. Besides, Care Teams in 18 districts also participate in the Social Welfare Department's District Services and Community Care Teams - Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers. Through visits or contact with singleton/doubleton elderly households, and carers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities, Care Teams would help identify needy cases and refer them to relevant social welfare units for follow up. They will also assist in referring eligible elderly persons and persons with disabilities to install and use emergency alarm systems.

The first term of the service agreements for Care Teams in 18 districts will be concluding in September to October this year. With a view to improving the effectiveness of Care Teams' work in the next term, we are reviewing various aspects of Care Teams. The Government adheres to the principle of ""people-oriented and local circumstances suited"" when planning and promoting work in districts. Hong Kong has a highly dense population and a diverse community structure. Each district has different demographics, geographical environments, social facilities and residents' needs. Therefore, while we may draw reference from the governance experience of Mainland China and Singapore, we shall fully take into account the uniqueness of each district in Hong Kong and flexibly adapt the service models in accordance with local conditions and needs.

As announced in 2024 Policy Address, the Government will regularise Care Teams, and increase funding amount by 50per cent in the next term of service in support of their work. Building on the established district networks and the foundation of the caring works, Care Teams will continue to strengthen and further extend their services at the district level through the effective use of the additional resources in the next term of service. Looking ahead, we will continue to strengthen the collaboration mechanism among the DCs, the ""three district committees"" and Care Teams – the ""troika"" – to comprehensively enhance service effectiveness and continuously improve people's sense of well-being and fulfilment."
立法會：政制及內地事務局局長動議二讀《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-07-16 15:17,2025-07-16 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600559.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議動議二讀《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》的發言全文：

主席：

我謹動議二讀《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

首先，十分感謝本月初在政制事務委員會會議上，各位議員就政府的立法想法提出了很多寶貴的意見。雖然大家的意見未必完全一致，甚至有時看似尖銳，但這正正反映出議會的寶貴之處，就是大家代表着社會不同界別、不同階層、不同聲音，在議會上按各自觀點和理念盡情各抒己見，但出發點依然是為香港好，為香港社會繁榮安定發展、由治及興而共同建言獻策，誠屬可貴。

因應大家的不同意見，政府在會後亦有作出周詳審慎考慮。考慮到政府在終審法院的裁決下，始終有着不可減免的積極義務，須於法院給予的兩年限期內確立替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係得到法律承認。為顯示特區政府對維護香港法治的決心從不動搖，以及對終審法院裁決的充分尊重，政府遂決定按計劃向立法會提交本《條例草案》，並希望得到議會的支持通過。

就今次政府推出的法案，我希望在此重申幾點重要原則。首先，有不少立法會議員以至坊間評論，都表示對擬議設立的同性伴侶關係承認機制感到十分憂慮，擔心會對傳統「一夫一妻、一男一女」的婚姻制度造成嚴重衝擊，甚或一旦缺口被打開，最終必然會走上同性婚姻的道路。對此，政府一再鄭重強調，事實是終審法院已一致判決確認，香港居民根據《基本法》及《香港人權法案》所保證和保障的婚姻憲法自由，只限於異性婚姻，並將同性婚姻排除在外。而現時建議設立的法律承認機制，亦只限於同性伴侶關係，絕對不等同於男女婚姻關係。這些都是十分清楚而明確的，絕對沒有任何轉圜的餘地。而作為負責任的特區政府，我們當然會堅定嚴格按照《基本法》，以「一夫一妻、一男一女」作為特區唯一的合法婚姻制度，並會堅守這制度不會讓任何政策或政策方針有所偏離。我們理解大家在這方面的憂慮，但同時亦希望大家對政府有信心，政府必定會堅守《基本法》所保障的傳統婚姻制度，盡一切努力不會讓其有所逾越。

第二，正如行政長官昨日在記者會上所說：「法治是香港經濟、投資者信心和賴以成功的基石，違反法治，後果嚴重」。誠然，我相信沒有人會質疑法治對香港的重要性，我們國家亦一直強調須以法治國。「不以規矩，不能成方圓」，沒有法治法度，又何來規則準繩，更遑論維持社會秩序和促進經濟發展。香港從來都是個法治城巿，同時亦因為我們的高度法治化和與世界法治接軌而促使我們成為聞名世界的國際大都會。而今次終審法院的裁決，亦是按照我們引以為傲的司法制度和法治精神，以《基本法》及《香港人權法案》的相關規定，合法合憲地行使終審權而作出的。而這終審裁決絕對有法律效力並對政府具有約束力，政府絕不能違反法庭裁決，而必須履行相關的積極義務，否則就是違反法治，破壞香港的成功基石。因此，即使個別人士可能對個別法官的裁決有不同看法，但亦應尊重法治、尊重法院按照現行司法制度而作出的合法裁決。我相信各位議員都是明理之人，必定能夠明白箇中道理和輕重之分。

第三，按照終審法院的裁決，雖然特區政府有積極義務確立替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，並制訂伴隨的適當權利和責任。但同時，法院亦明確表示，在制訂相關承認框架時，包括當中所包含的具體權利和責任，政府和立法機關享有彈性的酌情空間。此外，不同國家或地區亦可按照其憲制傳統、法律程序和社會價值觀去發展其法律。因此，在制訂相關法律承認框架時，我們已作出詳細研究和審慎考量，一方面符合法庭的裁決要求，滿足有關人士的「基本社會需求」，以履行特區政府的積極義務；同時亦顧及香港的實際情況、社會整體利益和公眾期望，取其平衡，務求形成一個「最大公約數」，盡量為各方所接受。我們當然明白，在這點上確實很難做到每個人都滿意的程度，畢竟現實上社會確切存在不同的意見和看法，這是客觀事實，但我們仍相信現時的方案已經取得合理平衡。而在社會包容共濟、融和團結的前提下，我們亦希望議員們可以客觀持平，實事求是地對本《條例草案》作出專業審議。

至於《條例草案》的具體內容，我在上次事務委員會會議上已作出詳細介紹，另外在立法會參考資料摘要中亦已詳細闡述，因此我在此就不再費時重複，但我希望重申兩點政府立場。

首先，有個別評論指，政府要求同性伴侶須在外地註冊後才可在本港進行登記，會為有關人士帶來不便和不公。這點我在上次委員會會議上已作出詳細解說。制訂這項要求的主要原因，是政府在登記時須確認有關關係為已作出承諾及穩定的關係，而建議的做法可提供客觀的準則和清晰的驗證，在行政執行上較為可行；而對登記人而言，亦可減少在核實過程中可能帶來的不便。因此，我們認為有關做法是合適的，亦不會對登記人造成太大的困難。

另外，亦有個別評論指，政府給予同性伴侶的權利不足，甚至有違終審法院的裁決。我想再次強調，法院的要求是我們須履行積極義務，讓同性伴侶受到法律保護免其私生活受到侵擾。而我們目前的方案，一方面設立法律承認機制，讓同性伴侶在透露其同性關係時免卻其私人生活受到干擾，同時亦給予核心權利，讓同性伴侶可滿足「基本的社會需求」。這已是符合法庭的要求，至於具體權利的制定，法院已明確表明行政及立法機關是有彈性的酌情空間，而我們按照香港的實際情況和整體利益作出考量和制訂，是絕對合理和合法的。

政府深切明白到今次推出的方案具爭議性，這是不爭事實。然而，為維護香港的法治、尊重終審法院的裁決以及履行我們的積極義務，政府亦以敢於承擔，勇於作為的態度推出《條例草案》，這亦充分彰顯了現屆政府遇事不避難的作風。我們希望議員們能實事求是，以理性持平的態度，聚焦審議今次《條例草案》，我們更歡迎議員就《條例草案》提出任何寶貴建議，以優化和完善方案，讓行政機關及立法會各司其職，妥善落實我們在《香港人權法案》下的積極義務。

主席，我懇請議員支持《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》。政府會全力配合立法會的審議工作，爭取盡快通過《條例草案》。

主席，我謹此陳辭。多謝主席。"
立法會：律政司司長就《2025年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》全體委員會審議階段修正案致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-07-16 15:16,2025-07-16 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600560.htm,"以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議就《2025年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》全體委員會審議階段修正案的致辭全文：

主席：

我現在提出修正案，修正《2025年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》第1（3）條、7（1）條、8（1）條、9（1）條、36（1）條的英文文本及180（2）條。另外，加入新的第68A條、68B條、101A條及194A條。修正案內容已載於先前由立法會秘書處發送予各議員的文件。以下我就修正案作出簡介。

委員會審議階段修正案

修正第1（3）條，以及加入新的第68A條、68B條和101A條

考慮到法案委員會的關注及經負責政策局檢視，政府建議在《條例草案》加入新的第68A條、68B條和101A條，一併處理其餘法例中與「Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal」相關的提述。在提出這些修訂的同時，政府建議針對所有與這提述相關的修訂，訂出具體生效日期，所以亦把《條例草案》第1（3）條作修訂讓所有相關的條文同日在二○二六年一月一日起實施，以預留足夠時間作更新該碼頭英文名稱的行政安排。

刪去第7（1）條、8（1）條及9（1）條

因應部分議員的意見，為確保條文的意思既簡潔又易明，政府建議在香港、澳門、台灣同時並列的情況下，保留在《保險業（估值及資本）規則》（第41章，附屬法例R）中對「中國大陸（Mainland China）」一詞的提述。
 
修正第36（1）條的英文文本

​因應立法會秘書處法律顧問的意見，這項修正案旨在使修訂建議的中英文文本一致。

修正第180（2）條，以及加入新的第194A條

在二○二五年五月二十三日生效的《2025年公司（修訂）（第2號）條例》修訂《會計及財務匯報局條例》（第588章）第2（1）條中「境外實體」的定義，並在《第588章》中加入一條提述「境外實體」一詞的新訂條文。鑑於上述對「境外實體」的定義的修訂以及新訂條文的加入，我們現提出的修正案，更新《條例草案》第180（2）條中有關《第588章》第2（1）條「境外實體」定義的修訂位置，以及將上述《第588章》新訂條文中對「境外實體」的提述，修改為「非香港實體」。 

結語

法案委員會對前述各項修正案並無異議。懇請各位委員支持有關修正案。

多謝主席。"
​立法會：律政司司長動議恢復二讀辯論《2025年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-07-16 15:15,2025-07-16 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600561.htm,"以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議動議恢復二讀辯論《2025年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》的致辭全文：

主席：

首先我代表律政司及有份參與《條例草案》的各政策局和部門感謝《2025年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》委員會（法案委員會）主席陳曼琪議員及其他委員的努力，令《條例草案》審議工作順利完成，並提出寶貴意見。

正如我在今年四月向立法會動議二讀時指出，律政司過去每隔一段時間會向立法會提交《成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》，以綜合條例草案方式對多項成文法則有效率地作出修訂。

承上一條《成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》在去年獲立法會通過的成功經驗，今年繼續在律政司的協調下，多個政策局把握機會對多項成文法則中一些不切合香港特別行政區憲制地位的條文或提述提出適應化修改建議。《條例草案》內的建議修訂大致可分為兩組：（1）並非由香港成文法系統性檢討衍生的修訂；以及（2）由香港成文法系統性檢討衍生的修訂，同時亦以綜合方式廢除若干成文法則中的過時條文或提述。建議修訂大多屬於輕微、技術性和無爭議的修訂，但有助於更新或改善現行法例。

法案委員會在五月十四日、六月六日及六月九日與我們政府同事舉行了三次會議，詳細審視了《條例草案》的條文。委員整體上同意《條例草案》的內容，並且支持盡快通過條例草案。

政府亦聽到委員的意見，深明適時更新或進一步完善法例，和完成法律適應化修改工作既重要又迫切。《2024年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》獲通過後，政府在短時間內提出另一條綜合條例草案，兩條條例草案合共處理超過200條條例，就完善法例方面，尤其在推動法律適應化修改的工作層面，取得了階段性成果。政府會繼續努力提速提效，加快處理餘下的法律適應化問題。就那些同樣屬於輕微、技術性以及無爭議的修例建議，律政司正積極研究在切實可行的情況下於二○二六年提出多一條綜合條例草案。我們希望負責的政策局能把握機會，及早擬備好草擬指示。

另外，我們考慮並吸納了法案委員會的意見，經諮詢相關政策局和部門，我稍後將會在全體委員會審議階段提出修正案，並就相關內容作出簡介，以及動議這些修正案。

主席，我謹此陳辭，懇請各位議員支持通過二讀《2025年成文法（雜項規定）條例草案》。

多謝主席。"

今年共有20名來自沙咀懲教所、壁屋懲教所及勵敬懲教所的青少年在囚人士報考香港中學文憑考試。他們共報考100張試卷，其中92張取得二級／達標或以上成績，佔總卷數92%，當中有四名考生考獲符合入讀本地大學的基本入學要求，其中一名沙咀懲教所考生考獲5科最高共20分及公民與社會發展科達標的成績，當中分別在中國語文科及數學科取得5*及5的佳績。另外兩名於勵敬懲教所及沙咀懲教所的考生亦分別考獲數學科5**及數學延伸部分（M1）5*的佳績。

他們報考的科目包括中國語文、英國語文、數學及公民與社會發展四個核心科目，以及經濟及旅遊與款待兩個選修科目等。

沙咀懲教所監督潘浩霖表示：「懲教署致力推行多元化更生計劃，鼓勵青少年在囚人士參加公開考試，及考取社會認可之學歷，以提升他們在獲釋後繼續升學或就業的機會，為日後重投社會作好準備。」

他說，青少年在囚人士參與香港中學文憑考試，雖然在過程中遇到不少困難，但他們並沒有放棄。青少年在囚人士憑着堅毅的意志和努力不懈的精神，在家人的支持，以及懲教人員的協助和老師的悉心教導下，不斷提升自己，盡力爭取好成績，實在非常難得。他呼籲公眾給予更生人士公平機會，接納及支持他們重新融入社會。

懲教署多年來為不足21歲的青少年在囚人士提供教育課程，協助他們考取認可資歷，建立正確的價值觀，並希望他們在獲釋後能夠繼續升學或就業，重新融入社會。"
Young persons in custody sit for HKDSE Examination for self-enhancement (with photos),2025-07-16 15:11,2025-07-16 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600428.htm,"The results of the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examination were released today (July 16). Young persons in custody (PICs) obtained satisfactory results in the examination this year.

A total of 20 young PICs from Sha Tsui Correctional Institution (STCI), Pik Uk Correctional Institution and Lai King Correctional Institution (LKCI) enrolled in the HKDSE Examination this year. They took a total of 100 examination papers and obtained level 2/""Attained"" or above in 92 papers, or 92 per cent of all papers taken. Four of them met the general entrance requirements for local universities, among whom one candidate at STCI scored the highest 20 marks in the best five subjects and obtained an ""Attained"" in Citizenship and Social Development, with level 5* in Chinese Language and 5 in Mathematics respectively.

Mr Poon said that although the young PICs had encountered many difficulties in the course of their preparation for the HKDSE Examination, they had not given up their academic pursuits. With unwavering perseverance and diligence, and family support as well as assistance from correctional officers and dedicated guidance from teachers, the young PICs continuously made strides and strived for good results, which was truly commendable. He called on the public to give rehabilitated persons fair opportunities and accept and support their reintegration into society.

The CSD has provided education to help young PICs below 21 years of age to gain accredited qualifications and develop positive values, hoping that they can further their studies, take up employment and reintegrate into society after release."
立法會二十一題：舊式樓宇的消防安全,2025-07-16 15:05,2025-07-16 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600509.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上鄭泳舜議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據報去年四月佐敦華豐大廈發生三級火警，分別導致5名和40名市民死亡及受傷，及後本會於去年十二月通過《2024年消防安全（建築物）（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》），讓政府可為未能遵從《消防安全（建築物）條例》的目標樓宇的業主代辦進行消防安全改善工程，並增加對不遵從消防安全指示等人士所施加的罰則，以提升舊式樓宇的消防安全水平。但據悉現時個別商住和工廠大廈仍出現雜物阻塞公共通道和防煙門沒有關閉等情況。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於香港消防處（消防處）在今年一月曾表示，當局對約1 000幢風險較高的舊式樓宇進行巡查，並發出了8 600多張消除火警危險通知書（通知書），當中「三無大廈」的佔比、有多少名人士遭檢控及定罪，以及其被檢控的原因分別為何，並按全港18區列出分項數字；

（二）鑑於當局在巡查第（一）項所述的樓宇時，向違規樓宇發出通知書或採取執法行動，截至目前為止，相關樓宇的遵辦率為何；當局會否定期再巡查相關樓宇；如會，詳情為何；

（三）當局在未來一年將主動巡查的舊式樓宇數量為何；

（四）鑑於根據政府於去年十二月提交本會保安事務委員會的文件，消防處將在《條例草案》通過後的起始階段，揀選10至20幢舊式樓宇讓政府進行代辦工程，當局最終選定了多少幢樓宇及其名稱，當中有多少幢為三無大廈；有關工程的進度及估算費用分別為何；

（五）當局會否考慮增加進行代辦工程的樓宇數目；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（六）據悉消防處正邀請一些舊樓業主參與物聯網火警偵測系統先導計劃，旨在利用物聯網技術，在單位內或樓宇的公共空間安裝感應器，一旦有火警發生，感應器會將相關訊息直接傳送至消防處，以加快當局進行救火行動的效率，但每區獲邀參加該計劃的樓宇數量並不多，該計劃的詳情為何，以及當局以何準則邀請樓宇業主參加？

答覆：

主席：

政府十分關心樓宇的消防安全，一直從多方面着手改善舊式樓宇的消防安全水平。

在執法方面，消防處會根據《消防條例》（第95章）處理樓宇內（包括舊樓）的火警危險。一般而言，消防處在進行樓宇內的防火巡查或投訴巡查期間，若發現逃生途徑被阻塞或鎖上、防煙門被打開或損壞、消防裝置或設備未能在有效操作狀態或缺乏年檢等，會向相關人士發出「消除火警危險通知書」或作出檢控。

另外，在法例方面，為提升舊式樓宇的消防安全水平，政府訂立《消防安全（建築物）條例》（《條例》）（第572章），規定於一九八七年或之前落成的綜合用途及住用建築物（目標樓宇），必須將防火保障提升至切合現代要求。消防處和屋宇署作為執行當局，一直有系統地就全港的目標樓宇進行聯合巡查，然後按照樓宇的實際情況和根據《條例》的規定，向業主或佔用人發出消防安全指示（「指示」），指明須進行的消防安全改善工程。受《條例》規管的目標樓宇約有14000幢，截至二○二五年五月底已完成巡查的目標樓宇約11 430幢，發出的「指示」合共超過40萬張。在發出的「指示」中，有約四成已獲遵辦或被撤銷，餘下約六成正在跟進中，當中有大部分目標樓宇在推展消防安全改善工程方面有積極進展，亦有部分樓宇在遵辦《條例》要求方面處於早期階段，有初步進展；另外有部分樓宇在籌組方面遇到實質的困難，例如有部分業主下落不明或無法聯絡，令他們無法籌組相關工程；而對於沒有進展又沒有合理辯解的個案，執行當局會陸續向有關樓宇提出檢控。

政府一直積極向舊式樓宇業主提供不同方面的支援（包括財政、業主之間的協調和統籌，以及技術方面的支援），以協助業主進行消防安全改善工程。為進一步提升目標樓宇的消防安全水平，我們已修訂《條例》，而相關的修訂條例已在二○二四年十二月十三日正式生效，賦權消防處和屋宇署可以代未能符合《條例》要求的業主進行消防安全改善工程（「代辦工程」），並在工程完成後向他們收回費用。此外，上述修訂條例亦引入不同措施推動業主自行遵從《條例》的要求。消防處和屋宇署作為執行當局正積極落實推行相關針對性的措施。

就鄭議員的提問，現回覆如下︰

（一）因應二○二四年四月發生的華豐大廈火警後，消防處已根據風險為本原則對約1000幢火警風險較高的舊式商住樓宇進行約8200次主動巡查，其間消防處發出8661張「消除火警危險通知書」，當中涉及向「三無大廈」發出的「消除火警危險通知書」的數字，以及成功檢控及被定罪的個案數字，按全港區議會分區的分布如下：

在檢控原因方面，最多的是涉及防煙門的違規情況（涉及259宗），其次為阻塞逃生途徑（涉及42宗）及與消防設備違規有關（涉及23宗）。

（二）及（三）就上文（一）提及的主動巡查而言，消防處共發出8 661張「消除火警危險通知書」。截至二○二五年六月底，超過九成已獲遵辦。

為進一步加強針對目標樓宇內火警危險的執法工作，消防處已於二○二五年三月分別在港島、九龍以及新界區成立「消防處樓宇改善特別職務隊」（名為「分區公眾安全隊」），完善以地區為本的風險管理工作，在未來一年將主動巡查1 800幢舊式樓宇，加強執法及消防安全教育工作。

（四）在推行「代辦工程」方面，我們已設立一個明確、客觀、具透明度的機制，設定門檻及釐定「代辦工程」的先後次序。在「代辦工程」機制的起始階段，執行當局會推行先導計劃，並已揀選十幢目標樓宇讓政府進行「代辦工程」，當中有超過一半為「三無大廈」。執行當局計劃在二○二五年第三季批出工程顧問及承建商合約；預期承建商將在二○二五年第四季開展工程，並在二○二六年年中前完成第一幢樓宇的「代辦工程」。

執行當局正就委聘工程顧問及承建商進行採購工作，因此尚未有工程費用的估算。待執行當局委聘的工程顧問就「代辦工程」完成勘察及評估後，執行當局可向相關業主提供工程的初步方案及整體費用的初步工程估算。

正如上文所述，我們修訂《條例》除了引入「代辦工程」外，亦引入不同措施，目的是推動業主自行遵從《條例》的要求，其中的一項措施是在執行當局的網站發布「指示」等資料，為公眾及物業準買家提供目標樓宇遵辦《條例》情況的資訊，希望能夠進一步推動業主進行工程。為此，消防處和屋宇署已分別在其網站（註）發布關於「指示」或「符合消防安全令」等的資料（即「指示」或「符合消防安全令」涉及的建築物或其部分的地址、「指示」和「符合消防安全令」的序號、發出日期，以及遵辦情況等），令市民（包括目標樓宇單位的準買家／租客）更清楚知悉目標樓宇任何未履行的法律責任，從而鼓勵業主遵辦《條例》的要求。

（五）推行先導計劃時，執行當局會密切留意監察「代辦工程機制」的落實和實施過程、與相關政府部門保持緊密協調，以確保有關機制持續有效地運作，並在總結經驗和考慮業界對這些工程的承受能力等因素後，決定每年進行「代辦工程」的數目及時間表，為「代辦工程」機制制定長遠和整體的策略，藉此協助有真正困難的業主提升舊式樓宇的防火保障。執行當局估計每年可為約20至60幢目標樓宇進行有關工程。

（六）消防處一直與時並進，善用創新科技提升行動效率，便民益民。展望未來，消防處會探討與電訊商合作推動智慧消防建設，加快數碼轉型，探索5G、大數據、物聯網、人工智能等技術在救援、防火及應急管理方面的創新應用，例如研究利用物聯網技術把火警偵測器的數據傳送到消防處的系統以期偵測火警等等，目的是在全面提升消防工作的智能化及信息化水平的同時，可提升樓宇的消防安全水平。消防處正就推行相關計劃進行前期的籌備工作（包括考慮一籃子因素，例如樓齡、樓層數目以及是否屬「三無大廈」等，以揀選合適的樓宇以推行先導計劃）。一如推行其他的新措施，消防處在研究上述技術以推行先導計劃後，會總結相關經驗及檢視成效，以考慮相關計劃的未來路向。

LCQ21: Fire safety of old buildings,2025-07-16 15:05,2025-07-16 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600498.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Vincent Cheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

It has been reported that a No. 3 alarm fire broke out at New Lucky House in Jordan in April last year, resulting in five deaths and 40 injuries of members of the public. This Council subsequently passed the Fire Safety (Buildings) (Amendment) Bill 2024 (the Bill) in December last year to enable the Government to carry out fire safety improvement works for target building owners who fail to comply with the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance, and to increase the penalties imposed on persons who fail to comply with Fire Safety Directions, etc., so as to enhance the fire safety standards of old buildings. However, it is learnt that at present, there are still cases with, among others, public passageways obstructed by miscellaneous articles and smoke stop doors not closed in individual composite buildings and factory buildings. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Hong Kong Fire Services Department (FSD) indicated in January this year that the authorities had inspected about 1 000 old buildings with higher risk and issued more than 8 600 Fire Hazard Abatement Notices (FHANs), of the percentage of ""three-nil buildings"" among such buildings, the number of persons prosecuted and convicted, and the reasons why they were prosecuted, with a breakdown by the 18 districts across the territory;

(2) given that the authorities issued FHANs to or took enforcement actions against the non-compliant buildings during the inspections of the buildings mentioned in (1), of the compliance rate of the buildings concerned so far; whether the authorities will further inspect the buildings concerned on a regular basis; if so, of the details;

(3) of the number of old buildings which the authorities will proactively inspect in the coming year;

(4) given that according to the paper submitted by the Government to the Panel on Security of this Council in December last year, the FSD will select 10 to 20 old buildings at the initial stage after the passage of the Bill for the Government to carry out defaulted works, of the number of buildings finally selected by the authorities, as well as their names, and the number of three-nil buildings among such buildings; the progress and estimated costs of the relevant works;

(5) whether the authorities will consider increasing the number of buildings for which defaulted works will be carried out; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(6) as it is learnt that although the FSD is inviting some owners of old buildings to participate in the Pilot Scheme on the Internet of Things (IoT) fire detection system (the Scheme) which aims to make use of IoT technology by installing sensors inside flats or in the public areas of buildings, so that in the event of a fire, the sensors will transmit the relevant information directly to the FSD, thereby speeding up the efficiency of the authorities in carrying out fire-fighting operations, only a small number of buildings in each district are invited to participate in the Scheme, of the details of the Scheme and the criteria adopted by the authorities for inviting building owners to participate in the Scheme?

Reply:

President,

Fire safety of buildings is a matter of great concern to the Government. A multi-pronged approach has been taken to improve the fire safety standards of old buildings.

With regard to law enforcement, the Fire Services Department (FSD) handles fire hazards in buildings (including old buildings) in accordance with the Fire Services Ordinance (Cap.95). Generally speaking, during the inspections of buildings in respect of fire safety or complaints, if it is discovered that the means of escape are obstructed or locked, the smoke stop doors are left open or defective, the fire service installations or equipment (FSIs) are not in efficient working order or have not undergone annual inspection, etc., the FSD will issue a Fire Hazard Abatement Notice (FHAN) or instigate prosecution against the relevant parties.

Moreover, in respect of legislation, to enhance the fire safety standard of old buildings, the Government enacted the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance (Cap.572) (the Ordinance) which stipulates that composite and domestic buildings constructed in or before 1987 (target buildings) must be enhanced to meet modern fire protection requirements. Being the enforcement authorities (EAs), the FSD and the Buildings Department (BD) conduct joint inspections of target buildings across the territory in a systematic manner, and in light of the actual condition of the buildings and in accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance, issue Fire Safety Directions (Directions) to the owners or occupiers, specifying the required fire safety improvement works. There are about 14000 target buildings regulated under the Ordinance. As of end-May 2025, about 11430 target buildings have been inspected and over 400000 Directions have been issued. Among those issued Directions, about 40 per cent of them have been complied with or discharged, with the remaining some 60 per cent are being followed-up on. Most of these target buildings are making positive progress in taking forward fire safety improvement works and some are in the early stages showing initial progress in complying with the requirements of the Ordinance. Some other buildings face genuine difficulties in co-ordinating efforts, e.g. some building owners being missing or untraceable, making it impossible to co-ordinate relevant works. For cases lacking progress without reasonable excuse, the EAs will progressively instigate prosecutions against relevant buildings.

The Government has been proactively providing various kinds of support (including support on financial aspects, co-ordination among owners and technical aspects) to owners of old buildings, assisting them in carrying out fire safety improvement works. To further enhance the fire safety standards of target buildings, amendments were made to the Ordinance, with the relevant Amendment Ordinance came into effect on December 13, 2024, empowering the FSD and the BD to carry out fire safety improvement works for owners who have failed to comply with the requirements of the Ordinance ( defaulted works), and to recover the relevant fees from them upon completion of the works. In addition, the above-mentioned Amendment Ordinance has also introduced different measures with a view to driving owners' compliance with the requirements of the Ordinance on their own initiative. The FSD and the BD, as the EAs, are proactively implementing the relevant targeted measures.

My reply to the questions raised by the Hon Cheng is as follows:

(1) In response to the tragic fire at New Lucky House occurred in April 2024, the FSD proactively conducted, under a risk-based principle, about 8200 inspections against some 1000 old composite buildings with relatively higher fire risk. A total of 8661 FHANs were issued during the inspections. The number of FHANs issued to ""three-nil buildings"", and the number of successful prosecutions and convictions, are tabulated by District Council districts distribution below –

In respect of the reasons for instigating prosecution, a majority number of cases involved smoke stop door-related irregularities (involving 259 cases), followed by obstruction to means of escape (involving 42 cases) and FSI-related irregularities (involving 23 cases).

(2) & (3)With respect to the proactive inspections mentioned in (1) above, a total of 8661 FHANs were issued by the FSD. As of end-June 2025, over 90 per cent of them had been complied with.

To further step up law enforcement actions against fire hazards in target buildings, the FSD has established the Building Improvement Special Duty Team (known as the Divisional Public Safety Team) in March2025 in Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and New Territories regions respectively to enhance district-based risk management efforts. In the coming year, the FSD will proactively carry out inspections of 1800 old buildings, strengthening law enforcement and enhancing fire safety education.

(4) As far as the implementation of the defaulted works mechanism is concerned, we have established a clear, objective and transparent mechanism to set a threshold and to prioritise defaulted works. During the initial stage of the defaulted works mechanism, a pilot scheme will be implemented by the EAs, under which 10 target buildings have been selected for the Government to carry out defaulted works, among which, more than half of them are ""three-nil buildings"". The EAs plan to award works consultancy and contractor contracts in the third quarter of 2025, and it is expected that contractors may commence the works in the fourth quarter of 2025 and the defaulted works for the first building will be completed by mid-2026. 

The EAs are in the procurement process for engaging works consultants and contractors. Therefore, cost of works is yet to be available. Following the completion of investigation and assessment on the defaulted works by the works consultants appointed by the EAs, the EAs may make available to the building owners concerned the initial proposal and preliminary total cost estimate for the defaulted works.

ããAs mentioned above, in addition to the introduction of defaulted works, we also introduced different measures in the legislative amendment exercise on the Ordinance, with a view to driving owners' compliance with the requirements of the Ordinance on their own initiative. One of those measures introduced is on publishing information of Directions, etc. on the EAs' websites, providing members of the public and prospective buyers with information about the compliance status of target buildings with the Ordinance, further driving owners to carry out fire safety improvement works. To this end, the FSD and the BD have respectively published on their websites (Note) information about Directions or Fire Safety Compliance Orders (FSCOs), etc. (i.e. the address of the building or part to which the Direction/FSCO relates, the serial number, date of issue and compliance status of the Direction and FSCO). This will allow members of the public (including the prospective buyers/tenants of target buildings units) to have better knowledge of the outstanding legal liabilities of the target buildings, thereby encouraging owners to comply with the requirements of the Ordinance.

(5) When implementing the pilot scheme, the EAs will closely monitor the implementation and execution of the defaulted works mechanism, and maintain close co-ordination with relevant government departments, in order to ensure its effective operation in a sustainable manner. The EAs will decide on the number and schedule of defaulted works per annum after consolidating the experience, taking into account factors such as the industry's capacity to undertake such works, and formulate long-term and holistic strategies for the mechanism, with a view to assisting owners with genuine difficulties in enhancing the fire protection of old buildings. The EAs expect that defaulted works can be carried out for around 20 to 60 target buildings each year.

(6) The FSD has long moved with the times and made good use of innovative technologies to enhance operational efficiency and bring convenience and benefits to the public. Looking ahead, the FSD will explore the collaboration with telecommunication service providers to promote smart firefighting, accelerate digital transformation, and explore innovative application of technologies, such as 5G, big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence in rescue, fire prevention and emergency management. This includes exploring the use of IoT technology to transmit data from fire detectors directly to the FSD's system for early fire detection, etc., the purpose of which is to enhance the fire safety standard of buildings while holistically improving the level of intelligentisation and informatisation in firefighting. The FSD is currently undertaking preliminary preparatory work for implementing the relevant scheme (including considering a basket of factors, such as building age, number of building storeys, and whether it is a ""three-nil building"", etc., in order to select suitable buildings for the pilot scheme). As in the cases of implementing other new measures, after exploring the application of the aforesaid technologies for the implementation of the pilot scheme, the FSD will consolidate relevant experience and review the effectiveness for considering the way forward of the relevant initiative.

立法會三題：促進企業來港上市,2025-07-16 14:50,2025-07-16 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600344.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上李慧琼議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的答覆：

問題：

為配合最新經濟趨勢和企業需求，證券及期貨事務監察委員會（下稱「證監會」）及香港交易及結算所有限公司（下稱「港交所」）正全面檢討上市制度，包括審視上市要求、改善審批流程及優化雙重上市門檻，以進一步便利新興產業和海外企業來港集資。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否推動港交所及證監會調整同股不同權公司及創新產業企業的上市門檻，以進一步吸引新經濟及創新科技公司來香港上市；

（二）會否考慮推動港交所優化上市公司的公眾持股量及市值規定，以促進更多大型及海外企業來港上市；及

（三）是否知悉港交所有何策略提升上市審批流程的效率及靈活性，並加強對海外優質企業的支援及指引，以應對競爭日益激烈的國際資本市場環境？

答覆：

主席：

作為國際金融中心，香港一直透過制度創新推動資本市場高質量發展，提升作為環球集資樞紐的功能。近年來，政府推動證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）和香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）推出多項上市制度改革，包括為「同股不同權」新經濟企業和科技公司提供量身定制的上市機制、建立便利海外上市的企業在港進行雙重上市或第二上市的監管框架等。

隨着一系列上市制度革新的落實，新股市場今年以來相當活躍。上半年香港迎來共42宗首次公開招股（IPO），合共集資超過1,070億港元，已較去年全年多約百分之二十二，暫列全球第一。上市申請個案亦正快速增加，港交所於六月底正處理超過200宗上市申請，創下二○二一年同期以來的新高。把握二○二五年勢頭持續向好，港交所和證監會正推進進一步的上市制度優化，以增強香港上市平台的活力和競爭力。

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢證監會和港交所後，我回覆如下：

（一）及（二）為緊貼市場需要，證監會和港交所持續檢視其上市機制及有關要求，在平衡相關風險和對投資者的保障下，吸納更多優質企業，包括海外和新經濟公司來港上市。其中，港交所已放寬大中華發行人在港第二上市的市值要求和刪除有關「創新產業公司」的條件；並給予擁有不同投票權或可變利益實體結構而符合第二上市規定的「獲豁免的大中華發行人」及「非大中華發行人」更大靈活性在港獲得主要上市地位。

港交所和證監會在二○二四年九月下調特專科技公司上市時的市值門檻，以提升相關上市框架的彈性。此外，「科企專線」於今年五月開通，向特專科技和生物科技公司在提交上市申請前提供專門指引，為發行人籌備上市的過程提供支持，也因應相關企業特性允許，以保密形式提交申請，有關措施亦適用於海外科技企業。港交所和證監會將根據申請量彈性調配資源，確保審批效率。

港交所和證監會一直致力完善香港上市制度，以便利更多優質企業在港上市，從而整體增強香港作為上市地的競爭力和活力。我們正進行全面檢視，研究範圍將涵蓋上市制度的多個層面。在協助企業融資外，亦需顧及保障投資者的權益及確保整體市場質素以吸引更多投資者來港投資，需要與不同持份者詳細溝通。我們知悉李議員和其他兩位議員在上星期就進一步優化《上市規則》促進海外優質企業來港上市發表報告提出多項建議，相關範疇例如審視包括主要上市、第二及雙重主要上市的具體要求，及上市後的持續合規要求等，已包括在港交所和證監會的檢討內，具體建議會在檢視過程中一併考慮。港交所會按「成熟一項、推出一項」原則就優化建議適時對外公布，並進行公眾諮詢。

此外，港交所於二○二四年十二月就優化首次公開招股市場定價及公開市場的建議展開諮詢，當中包括按發行人的市值對其上市時的最低公眾持股量作分層規定，並就是否容許發行人在上市後有更大彈性維持較低的公眾持股量徵詢意見。港交所正整合和考慮收集到的意見，並將就持續公眾持股量的具體建議進行進一步諮詢。

（三）我們一直致力吸引來自世界各地不同規模和具發展潛力的企業來港上市融資。就此，港交所已簡化海外發行人的上市規定，引入一套適用於所有發行人的核心股東保障水平以便利合規。港交所亦已就海外發行人來港上市刊發指引，並按需要就個別司法管轄區發布進一步的解釋說明。為便利更多優質企業在港融資，證監會和港交所於去年落實優化新上市申請審批流程時間表（註），提升上市申請程序的透明度和效率，令審批時間更有確定性。現時雙重主要上市的企業在符合相關資格下亦已可被納入港股通。

在各項優化海外發行人上市機制的基礎上，港交所持續檢視其認可證券交易所的範圍，讓在海外主板市場上市的公司可在香港申請第二上市。繼於二○二三年及二○二四年將沙特交易所、印尼證券交易所、阿布扎比證券交易所及杜拜金融市場納入其認可證券交易所名單，港交所在今年三月進一步新增泰國證券交易所，將名單內的海外證券交易所數目增加至20間。

展望未來，政府聯同證監會和港交所會繼續加強對外推廣的力度，宣傳香港各個金融服務領域包括上市平台的最新發展和優勢。與此同時，港交所會探索進一步擴大認可證券交易所的範圍和簡化海外發行人的上市程序，並更積極為發行人提供指引，便利它們籌備來港上市。

多謝主席。

LCQ3: Facilitating enterprises to list in Hong Kong,2025-07-16 14:50,2025-07-16 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600342.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Starry Lee and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 To dovetail with the latest economic trends and corporate needs, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) are conducting a comprehensive review of the listing regime, including reviewing the listing requirements, improving the vetting process and optimising the thresholds for dual listings, so as to further facilitate the emerging sector and overseas enterprises to raise capital in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will drive the HKEX and the SFC to adjust the listing thresholds for companies with weighted voting right structures and enterprises from the innovative sector, so as to further attract new economy as well as innovation and technology companies to list in Hong Kong;

(2) whether it will consider driving the HKEX to enhance the public float and market capitalisation requirements for listed companies, so as to facilitate more large-scale and overseas enterprises to list in Hong Kong; and

(3) whether it knows the strategies put in place by the HKEX to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the vetting process for listing, as well as to provide stronger support and clearer guidance for overseas quality enterprises, in response to the increasingly competitive environment of the international capital market?

Reply:

President,

 As an international financial centre, Hong Kong has been taking forward high-quality development of its capital market through institutional innovation, thereby enhancing the role as a global fundraising hub. In recent years, the Government has driven the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to introduce a series of reforms to the listing regime. These include tailored listing mechanisms for new economy enterprises with weighted voting rights (WVR) structures and technology companies, the establishment of a regulatory framework to facilitate dual primary or secondary listing of overseas listed issuers in Hong Kong, etc.

 With the implementation of the series of listing reforms, the primary market has shown notable vibrancy this year. In the first half of the year, Hong Kong recorded 42 initial public offerings (IPOs), raising over HK$107 billion in total, approximately 22 per cent more than the full-year total for last year and ranking first globally in the year-to-date. The number of listing applications is also increasing rapidly. At the end of June, the HKEX was processing over 200 listing applications, the highest level since the same period in 2021. Riding on the positive momentum in 2025, the HKEX and the SFC are taking forward further enhancements to the listing regime so as to boost the vitality and competitiveness of Hong Kong's listing platform.

 In consultation with the SFC and the HKEX, my response to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) and (2) To closely follow market developments, the SFC and the HKEX continuously review their listing regime and related requirements, with a view to attracting more high-quality enterprises including overseas and new economy companies to list in Hong Kong, while balancing relevant risks and investor protection. Notably, the HKEX relaxed the market capitalisation requirement for Greater China issuers seeking secondary listing in Hong Kong and removed the relevant condition of being an ""innovative company"". ""Grandfathered Greater China issuers"" and ""non-Greater China issuers"" with WVR or variable interest entity structures that meet the secondary listing requirements have also been provided with greater flexibility to obtain primary listing status in Hong Kong.

 In September 2024, the HKEX and the SFC lowered the market capitalisation threshold at the time of listing for specialist technology companies to enhance the flexibility of the relevant listing framework. In addition, a dedicated ""technology enterprises channel"" (TECH) was launched in May this year to provide tailored guidance to specialist technology and biotechnology companies before they submit their listing applications, thereby providing support to issuers in their listing preparation process. The issuers may also submit listing applications confidentially, taking into account the unique characteristics of relevant enterprises. These measures are also applicable to overseas technology companies. The HKEX and the SFC will allocate resources flexibly based on application volumes to ensure efficient processing.

 The HKEX and the SFC are committed to improving Hong Kong's listing regime to facilitate listing of more high-quality companies, thereby enhancing the overall competitiveness and vibrancy of Hong Kong as a listing venue. We are conducting a comprehensive review, with the scope of review to cover multiple aspects of the listing regime. In addition to supporting fundraising by enterprises, it also has to safeguard protection of investors' interests and the overall market quality so as to attract more investors to invest in Hong Kong, which requires in-depth engagement with different stakeholders. We are aware that Dr the Hon Starry Lee and two other Members published a report last week putting forward various recommendations to further enhance the Listing Rules to attract listing of high-quality overseas issuers in Hong Kong. The relevant areas such as reviewing the specific requirements for primary, secondary and dual primary listing, as well as post-listing continuing obligations, etc, are already covered in the scope of the ongoing review by the HKEX and the SFC. Specific proposals will be considered as part of the process. The HKEX will announce relevant enhancement measures with public consultation to be conducted as appropriate once they are ready.

 In addition, the HKEX launched a consultation on proposals to enhance IPO price discovery and open market regulation in December 2024, which include a tiered approach to minimum public float requirements at the time of listing based on issuers' market capitalisation, and seeking views on whether issuers should be allowed greater flexibility to maintain a lower public float post-listing. The HKEX is currently consolidating and reviewing the feedback received, and will conduct further consultation on specific proposals regarding the ongoing public float requirements.

(3) We are committed to attracting companies of various sizes and with growth potential from around the world to list and raise funds in Hong Kong. To this end, the HKEX has streamlined the listing requirements for overseas issuers and introduced a set of core shareholder protection standards applicable to all issuers to facilitate compliance. The HKEX has also issued guidance for overseas issuers seeking to list in Hong Kong and published further jurisdiction-specific explanatory notes on a need basis. To facilitate fundraising by more high-quality companies in Hong Kong, the SFC and the HKEX implemented the enhanced timeframe for approval of new listing applications last year (Note), thereby improving the transparency and efficiency of the listing application process, and providing greater certainty on the vetting time. Enterprises with dual primary listing that meet the relevant eligibility criteria are currently also eligible for inclusion in Southbound trading of Stock Connect.

 Building on the various enhancements to the listing regime for overseas issuers, HKEX continues to review the scope of recognised stock exchanges to enable companies listed on overseas main markets to seek secondary listing in Hong Kong. Following the inclusion of the Saudi Exchange, the Indonesia Stock Exchange, the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and the Dubai Financial Market onto the list of recognised stock exchanges in 2023 and 2024, the HKEX further added the Stock Exchange of Thailand in March this year, bringing the total number of recognised overseas exchanges on the list to 20.

 Looking ahead, the Government, together with the SFC and the HKEX, will continue to step up external promotion efforts to showcase the latest developments and strengths of Hong Kong's financial services sector, including the listing platform. Meanwhile, the HKEX will explore further expansion of the scope of recognised stock exchanges and simplification of the listing process for overseas issuers, while more proactively providing guidance to facilitate their preparations for listing in Hong Kong.

 Thank you, President.

Note: Including confirmation within 40 business days for general new listing applications, or within 30 business days for eligible A-share companies, on whether there are any major regulatory concerns."
LCQ15: Formulating a comprehensive population policy,2025-07-16 14:50,2025-07-16 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600324.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Nixie Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

According to data from the Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong's total fertility rate in 2024 was only 0.841, far below the 2.1 level required for population replacement. Furthermore, a survey by a youth service organisation indicated that only 36 per cent of young people in Hong Kong who had responded in the survey expressed a preference for marriage or childbearing. Another survey showed that just around 23.27 per cent of respondents aged between 19 and 29 expressed a desire to have children, ranking among the lowest levels globally. There are views that the Government should adopt measures to enhance marriage and fertility rates among young people and develop a comprehensive population policy to avoid population ageing and workforce shrinkage. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will commence a systematic survey and study on the marriage and fertility situation of young people in Hong Kong, so as to deeply analyse the core factors influencing their decisions regarding marriage and childbearing, particularly through assessment in areas such as financial burdens, housing difficulties and job stability, with a view to gaining a more precise understanding of their concerns and expectations; if so, of the direction and timetable of the survey and study; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as there are views pointing out that young people's lack of knowledge and confidence in future planning and gender relations indirectly undermine their willingness to marry and have children, whether the Government will consider, through cross-departmental collaboration, integrating existing fertility support measures for young people (e.g. child-rearing subsidies, priority quotas for public housing allocation, and childcare services for working families) and consolidating such information within the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau's ""HKYouth+"" mobile application, as well as adding a designated information corner to the application that covers topics such as reproductive health, sex education, and marriage and fertility support, with a view to strengthening support for young people in the aspects of affective education and reproductive health information; if so, of the timetable; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views pointing out that although the Government has established the Human Resources Planning Commission to follow up on population policy, Hong Kong's current population policy still lacks comprehensiveness, whether the Government will review the Commission's work or establish a task force coordinated by an official at the level of Secretary of Department to institutionally integrate cross-departmental resources, with a view to formulating more comprehensive population policy objectives for Hong Kong to address the long-term challenges of population development?

In consultation with the Chief Secretary for Administration’s Office, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration's Office, the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), the Housing Bureau (HB), the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the Health Bureau (HHB), the consolidated reply to the questions raised by the Hon Nixie Lam is as follows:

(1) & (2) The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) has been regularly collating data related to marriage and fertility trends across different age groups. The C&SD also publishes feature articles from time to time, giving a brief account of the marriage and fertility trends in Hong Kong and analysing the factors underlying such trends.

Hong Kong and many countries or places worldwide are facing a decline in fertility rate. In the face of this challenge, the Government must formulate measures to raise fertility rate. As such, the Chief Executive (CE) announced in his 2023 Policy Address a host of measures to promote fertility and create a conducive environment for childbearing through a ""combination punches"" approach. These measures include providing Newborn Baby Bonus, giving families with newborns priority on flat selection and allocation, enhancing child care support and increasing tax concessions. Office/ bureaux implementing the measures include the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration’s Office, the HB, the LWB, the HHB, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) and the FSTB.

The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has implemented the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme and the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme to encourage childbearing by giving incentives to family applicants of public rental housing (PRH) and subsidised sale flats (SSF) sale exercises. 

Regarding the allocation of PRH, the HA has implemented the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme since April 1, 2024. PRH family applications with babies born on or after October 25, 2023 and aged one or below are credited one year of waiting time. As at end-June 2025, about 5000 PRH applications have been credited one year of waiting time under the scheme, of which about 420 families have already been successfully housed to PRH.

As for SSF, starting from the Sale of Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) Flats 2024 (HOS 2024), the HA has implemented the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme which was announced in the 2023 Policy Address. A quota of about 40 per cent of the new flats for sale (i.e. 2 900 flats) under HOS 2024 were set aside for eligible applicants under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme and the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members for balloting and priority flat selection. Family applicants of HOS with babies born on or after October 25, 2023 are eligible if their children are aged three or below on the closing day of the application.

During the application period of HOS 2024, the HA received a total of around 106000 applications. Among them, around 50000 were family applicants, of which around 19 000 (i.e. about 40 per cent) applied under the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members and Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme. Among these 19000 applicants, 800 applicants have successfully purchased flats through the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme. If eligible families applying under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme fail to purchase a flat under HOS 2024, they may still apply under the Scheme for priority flat selection as long as their children are aged three or below on the closing day of the application in subsequent SSF sale exercises.

The Government announced in the 2023 Policy Address that a cash reward of $20,000 will be provided to eligible parents for each baby born from October 25, 2023, for a period of three years. Starting from October 25, 2023, parents can submit an application for the bonus at the same time when registering the birth of their baby and applying for a birth certificate. As of end-June 2025, a total of 49567 qualified applications have been received, and the bonus has been distributed to 48 984 applicants, at a total amount of approximately $979 million. The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration's Office is carrying out a review of the Newborn Baby Bonus Scheme.

The Government has been supporting parents who cannot take care of their children temporarily through subsidising non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to provide a variety of day child care services, including Child Care Centres (CCCs), the After School Care Programme and the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project (NSCCP). To strengthen support for working families in childbearing, the Government has announced the setting up of additional 11 aided standalone CCCs in phases, doubling the total number of service places to reach around 2000. The Government is extending the After School Care Programme for pre-primary children to cover all districts in phases, and increasing the number of service places under the NSCCP to 2500 with the estimated number of beneficiaries increasing to 25000. The Social Welfare Department will also provide information and assistance to private organisations applying for registration to operate CCCs, and encourage private organisations to provide child care support for their employees. Meanwhile, the Government reviews the Working Family Allowance (WFA) Scheme from time to time. The rates of the household and child allowances under the WFA Scheme have been increased by 15 per cent across the board with effect from April 2024, benefiting all households receiving the WFA. The WFA Scheme provides additional allowances for relevant childbearing families, and increasing the rates of the WFA helps further alleviate the burden of grassroots working families. Taking a four-person household with two eligible children as an example, the maximum monthly WFA they may receive have increased from the original amount of $4,200 to $4,830 at present.

As regards tax concessions, starting from the year of assessment (YA) 2023/24, the basic child allowance and the additional child allowance for each child born during the YA have been raised from $120,000 to $130,000. In addition, starting from YA 2024/25, for taxpayers who live with their children born on or after October 25, 2023 and meet the prescribed conditions, the deduction ceiling for home loan interest or domestic rents will be raised from $100,000 to $120,000 for a maximum of 19 YAs. These measures can encourage childbearing by helping taxpayers to alleviate their financial burden from raising children.

As regards antenatal services, currently the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Departments of the Hospital Authority and the Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) of the Department of Health (DH) provide free antenatal services for all local pregnant women who are eligible persons (who generally refer to holders of Hong Kong Identity Cards or such other persons as may be approved by the Chief Executive of the Hospital Authority/ Director of Health) to ensure the health of the pregnant women and their foetuses. The scope of services includes the first antenatal check-up, personal and family medical history, as well as various investigations and vaccinations conducted by doctors according to the clinical needs of individual pregnant women.

Besides, as announced in the 2024 Policy Address, the DH will revamp maternal and child health and family planning services to strengthen pre-pregnancy counselling and parental education and promote healthy fertility. The DH will provide the new pre-pregnancy health services to reproductive age group women at the MCHCs in phases, support women in preparing for pregnancy through health consultation and counselling, health assessments, arrangement of blood tests and other investigations, and provide nutritional dietary and lifestyle advice, to align with the Government's policy of encouraging and promoting healthy fertility, as well as protecting and advancing maternal and child health. Details on the above initiatives will be announced at an appropriate juncture. In addition, the DH will review and adjust the scope of the subsidised family planning service currently provided by NGOs, so as to dovetail with the Government's policy of encouraging and promoting healthy fertility.

The HYAB has been supporting the work of the Family Council (the Council) in promoting a culture of loving families to the general public through organising different publicity programmes and activities. In October 2024, the HYAB and the Council launched the five-year Funding Scheme on the Promotion of Family Education (the Scheme). With an annual funding of $8 million, the Scheme subsidises non-profit-making community projects in promoting family education. NGOs may, based on societal needs, apply to the Scheme for funding to implement projects related to topics such as family building, new parents, and marriage-related. On the other hand, the Council has been encouraging the wider adoption of more diversified and flexible family-friendly employment practices (FFEPs) in the community. Measures include launching promotional videos entitled ""Family-friendly Workplace"", which feature various FFEPs adopted by local companies, and collaborating with the Radio Television Hong Kong to produce radio programmes to promulgate different types of FFEPs. These measures will also help foster a pro-family environment.

The HYAB launched the first release of the ""HKYouth+"" youth mobile application in March 2024, and has been continuously updating it to cater to the needs of young people. Its content cover various areas, including personal development opportunities, local hot topics, national development, world news, arts and leisure, innovation and technology, physical and mental wellness. It aims to help young people expand their knowledge, explore interests and enrich themselves in different aspects. The HYAB will work with relevant bureaux and departments to encourage them to make use of ""HKYouth+"" for strengthening promotion of various support measures to the youth community.

(3) The population policy straddles a wide range of policy areas, involving various bureaux. For the current term of the HKSAR Government, in addition to the standing committees, the CE and Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of Departments are now providing high-level steer as necessary through various channels, such as working groups and inter-departmental meetings, to coordinate relevant inter-departmental work.

Chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Human Resources Planning Commission (HRPC) consolidates resources and efforts of the Government and various sectors to examine, review and holistically co-ordinate policies and measures on human resources, including issues pertaining to the population policy. The HRPC is a high-level policy platform, with eight policy secretaries, including Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Secretary for Education, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Secretary for Health, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Secretary for Labour and Welfare and Secretary for Security; the Government Economist; the Commissioner for Census and Statistics and the Chairmen of the Employees Retraining Board, the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications and the Vocational Training Council as ex-officio members; and non-official members drawn from a diverse mix of experts and stakeholders from different fields and sectors. Since its establishment in 2018, the HRPC has looked into a number of issues to tackle the demographic challenges, facilitating the Government to formulate and refine the relevant policies and measures.

Currently, population policy measures have been subsumed under the portfolios of various bureaux as part of the ongoing efforts. As the Government's existing steering and inter-departmental co-ordination mechanism are flexible and effective, the Government does not consider it necessary to set up a separate structure for the work on the population policy."
​立法會十五題：制訂全面的人口政策,2025-07-16 14:49,2025-07-16 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600323.htm,"​以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上林琳議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆︰

問題：

根據政府統計處資料，二○二四年香港的總和生育率僅0.841，遠低於人口更替所需的2.1水平。此外，有青年服務機構的調查顯示，僅有36%受訪香港青年表示傾向結婚或生育，另外亦有調查顯示年齡介乎19至29歲的受訪群體中，僅有約23.27%表示有生育意願，屬全球最低水平之一。有意見認為，政府應採取措施提升青年結婚率及生育率，並制訂全面的人口政策，以避免人口老化及勞動力萎縮。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否就本港青年的結婚與生育狀況展開系統性調查與研究，深入分析影響其結婚與生育決定的核心因素，特別是就經濟負擔、住屋困難、職業穩定性等方面進行評估，以更精準理解其顧慮與期望；如會，調研方向與時間表為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於有意見指出青年對未來規劃及兩性關係方面的掌握與信心不足，均間接削弱其婚育意願，政府會否考慮透過跨部門協作，整合現行針對青年的生育支援措施（例如育兒津貼、公屋優先配額、在職家庭託管服務等），並將有關資訊統一整合至民政及青年事務局的HKYouth+手機應用程式中，並在該程式增設包括生殖健康、性教育及婚育支援的資訊專區，以加強對他們在情感教育與生育健康資訊方面的支援；如會，時間表為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見指雖然政府已成立人力資源規劃委員會負責跟進人口政策，但現時本港的人口政策仍有欠全面，政府會否檢視該委員會的工作，或成立一個由司長級官員統籌的專責小組，從制度上整合跨部門資源，以為香港謀劃更完整的人口政策方針，以應對長遠人口發展挑戰？

答覆：

主席：

就林琳議員的提問，經諮詢政務司司長辦公室、政務司副司長辦公室、勞工及福利局（勞福局）、房屋局、財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）、醫務衞生局（醫衞局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）至（二）政府統計處一直定期匯集與不同年齡層婚姻及生育狀況相關的數據，並不時發表簡述香港婚姻及生育趨勢的專題文章，以及分析影響其趨勢的因素。

生育率下跌是香港以至全球很多國家或地方均面對的事實。面對這個情況，政府必須謀劃提高生育率的措施。因此，行政長官在二○二三年《施政報告》以「組合拳」的方式，公布了一系列鼓勵生育措施，締造一個有利生育的環境。措施包括發放新生嬰兒獎勵金、為有新生嬰兒的家庭提供優先揀樓上樓、加強託兒支援，以及增加稅務優惠等。推行措施的辦公室／政策局包括政務司副司長辦公室、房屋局、勞福局、醫衞局、民政及青年事務局（民青局）和財庫局等。

香港房屋委員會（房委會）已推出「家有初生優先配屋計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」，為公共租住房屋（公屋）及資助出售單位銷售計劃的家庭申請者提供誘因，以鼓勵生育。

在公屋編配方面，房委會已於二○二四年四月一日起實施「家有初生優先配屋計劃」，凡有於二○二三年十月二十五日或以後出生而年滿一歲或以下的初生嬰兒的公屋家庭申請，均可獲縮減一年輪候時間。截至二○二五年六月底，已有約5 000宗公屋申請在計劃下獲縮減一年輪候時間，當中約420宗已成功獲安排入住公屋。

而在資助出售單位方面，房委會已由「出售居者其屋計劃（居屋）單位2024」（「居屋2024」）起，落實二○二三年《施政報告》公布推出的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」。在「居屋2024」新推售單位中，預留約四成單位作配額（即2 900個單位），供參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」和「家有長者優先選樓計劃」的合資格申請者攪珠和優先選樓。凡有嬰兒於二○二三年十月二十五日或以後出生的居屋家庭申請者，而其子女在申請截止日期時為三歲或以下，均符合申請資格。

在「居屋2024」申請期內，房委會共收到約106 000份申請表，其中約50 000份屬家庭申請者。當中參加「家有長者優先選樓計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」的申請共有約19000份，佔家庭申請者約四成，其中有約800個申請者已通過「家有初生優先選樓計劃」成功購買單位。未能在「居屋2024」中成功選購單位的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」合資格家庭，只要他們的子女在日後推出的資助出售單位銷售計劃的申請截止日期時為三歲或以下，仍可參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」而獲優先選樓。

政府在二○二三年《施政報告》公布，向合資格的父母，就每名於二○二三年十月二十五日起出生的嬰兒給予二萬元的現金獎勵，計劃為期三年。由二○二三年十月二十五日開始，父母在為嬰兒辦理出生登記及申領出世紙時，可同時提交獎勵金的申請。截至二○二五年六月底，政府共接獲49 567宗合資格申請，並已向48 984名申請人發放獎勵金，總發放金額約為9.79億元。政務司副司長辦公室正就新生嬰兒獎勵金計劃進行檢討。

政府一直資助非政府機構為兒童提供多元化的日間照顧服務，以支援暫時未能照顧子女的家長，包括幼兒中心、課餘託管服務和鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃等。為加強支援在職家庭育兒，政府已公布會分階段增設共11所資助獨立幼兒中心，服務名額會倍增至共約2 000個。政府正分階段推展學前兒童課餘託管服務至全港，並把鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃的服務名額增加至2500個，預計受惠兒童人數會增至25000人。社會福利署亦會就私人機構開辦幼兒中心的註冊申請提供資訊和協助，並鼓勵私人機構為僱員提供幼兒照顧支援。此外，政府不時檢視在職家庭津貼（職津）計劃。自二○二四年四月起，職津計劃劃一增加住戶及兒童津貼金額15%，所有領取職津的家庭均可受惠。職津計劃為育有子女的相關家庭提供額外津貼，增加職津金額有助進一步紓緩基層在職家庭的負擔。以一個育有兩名合資格兒童的四人住戶為例，可領取的職津最高金額已由原本每月4,200元增加至現時每月高達4,830元。

稅務優惠方面，由二○二三／二四課稅年度起，子女基本免稅額及子女出生課稅年度的額外免稅額，已由12萬元提升至13萬元。此外，由二○二四／二五課稅年度起，與二○二三年十月二十五日或之後出生的子女同住的納稅人若符合指明條件，居所貸款利息或住宅租金的扣除限額可由10萬元增加至12萬元，為期最多19個課稅年度。這些措施均有助減輕納稅人供養子女的負擔，從而鼓勵生育。

產前服務方面，現時醫院管理局的婦產科及衞生署的母嬰健康院已為所有屬符合資格人士（一般而言是指持有香港身份證的人士或醫院管理局行政總裁╱衞生署署長認可的其他人士）的孕婦提供免費產前服務，確保孕婦及胎兒的健康。服務內容包括首次產前檢查、查詢個人及家族病歷，以及多項由醫生根據孕婦的個別臨床需要而進行的檢查和疫苗接種等。

另外，正如二○二四年《施政報告》公布，衞生署會重整母嬰健康及家庭計劃服務，加強生育輔導及育兒教育，促進健康生育。衞生署會分階段在母嬰健康院為生育年齡婦女提供新的孕前健康服務，在婦女預備懷孕前，為她們提供健康諮詢及輔導、身體檢查、血液及其他化驗、飲食營養及生活模式建議等，以配合政府鼓勵及推廣健康生育的政策，以及進一步保護和促進母嬰健康。上述措施的詳情將適時公布。此外，衞生署會檢討及調整現時由非政府機構提供的資助家庭計劃服務範疇，配合政府鼓勵及促進健康生育的政策。

民青局一直支援家庭議會（議會）的工作，透過不同的宣傳項目和活動，向市民大眾宣揚關愛家庭的文化。民青局與議會於二○二四年十月推出為期五年的家庭教育推廣計劃（計劃），每年撥款800萬元，資助民間推行非牟利的家庭教育項目。非政府機構可因應社會的需要，向計劃申請推行與家庭建設、新手父母及婚姻有關的項目。另一方面，議會致力在社區推廣更多元化和靈活的家庭友善僱傭措施，當中包括推出名為「家庭友善在職場」的宣傳短片，介紹本地公司推行的各類家庭友善僱傭措施，以及與香港電台合作推出電台節目，向聽眾宣傳不同類型的家庭友善僱傭措施。這些措施亦有助營造有利家庭的環境。

民青局於二○二四年三月推出HKYouth+青年手機應用程式首推版本，並持續更新以切合青年人的需要，其內容涵蓋不同範疇，包括個人發展機會、本地熱話、國家發展、世界消息、藝術文娛、創新科技及身心健康等，讓青年人可以在不同方面增長知識、探索興趣和充實自己。民青局會與相關決策局及部門合作，鼓勵它們善用HKYouth+以加強向青年群體宣傳各項支援生育措施。

（三）人口政策涉及眾多政策範疇，多個政策局都參與其中。就現屆特區政府而言，除常設委員會外，行政長官、司長和副司長亦會按需要以透過工作組和跨部門會議等不同形式提供高層次的督導，統籌跨部門的相關工作。

由政務司司長擔任主席的人力資源規劃委員會（規劃委員會）現時負責整合政府和各界的資源和力量，檢視、檢討及統籌宏觀的人力資源政策及措施，包括人口政策相關的議題。規劃委員會是高層次的政策平台，當然委員包括商務及經濟發展局、政制及內地事務局、教育局、財庫局、醫衞局、創新科技及工業局、勞福局和保安局八個政策局的局長；政府經濟顧問；統計處處長；以及僱員再培訓局、香港學術及職業資歷評審局和職業訓練局的主席。非官方委員則包括不同行業和界別的專家和持份者。自二○一八年成立以來，規劃委員會探討了多項應對人口挑戰的議題，有助政府制定及優化相應政策及措施。

目前人口政策措施已融入各政策局的工作，成為恆常政策的一部分。政府現時在督導和統籌跨部門工作方面的機制靈活有效，無需就人口政策工作另設專責架構。"
CS visits Heilongjiang Province (with photos/video),2025-07-16 14:33,2025-07-16 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600506.htm,"  The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, arrived in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province yesterday afternoon (July 15), to continue his visit.

  Mr Chan met with the Secretary of the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, Mr Xu Qin, to exchange views on deepening co-operation between Hong Kong and Heilongjiang Province. Mr Chan said that over the past year, Hong Kong and Heilongjiang have had mutual engagements, close exchanges and co-operation efforts that have reached an unprecedented level. At the Heilongjiang-Hong Kong Investment Cooperation Conference held in Hong Kong in March this year, the two places signed Memoranda of Understanding for strengthening co-operation on education, economics and trade, culture and tourism, sports and youth, and other fields, breaking new ground and laying a solid foundation for future co-operation. He said that Hong Kong possesses the unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and a business environment that is highly market-oriented and internationalised, underpinned by the rule of law and an array of global professional talent and services. Mr Chan said he eagerly looks forward to deepening co-operation in all aspects between Hong Kong and Heilongjiang, complementing each other's strengths,and achieving mutual benefits to make greater contributions to building a great country and realising the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

  Afterwards, Mr Chan attended the launch ceremony of the Hong Kong Patriotic Education Heilongjiang Study Tour under the Strive and Rise Programme. On behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, he expressed gratitude to the Heilongjiang Provincial Government for its strong organisational support work for the study tour, which travelled to and from Harbin by chartered flights arranged by Greater Bay Airlines. With over 130 participants, this study tour is the largest tour in scale since the launch of the Strive and Rise Programme. Mr Chan said at the event that given the rapid advancements in the country’s science and technology sectors, Heilongjiang Province has also developed various high-tech industries. He encouraged the participants to engage in different activities on the study tour to deepen the understanding of the country’s history, culture and economic development, and experience fascinating technological innovations. These will help the participants set goals for their future and strive for upward mobility.

  This morning (July 16), Mr Chan and members of the study tour visited the Exhibition Hall of Evidences of Crime Committed by Unit 731 of the Japanese Imperial Army, which is one of the first batch of 100 demonstration bases for patriotic education in the country. The visit allowed the participants to gain a deeper understanding of the crimes of Unit 731 through the displayed objects, pictures, archives, multimedia materials etc. Mr Chan said that this year marks the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance, and the exhibition hall is an important place for patriotic education. He said he hopes that members of the study tour will take this opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the hardships in national development and building a strong nation, cultivate a deeper and firmer patriotic sentiment through recognising historical facts, and consciously shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding national security.

  In the afternoon, Mr Chan met with the Secretary of the CPC Harbin Municipal Committee, Mr Yu Hongtao. They exchanged views on promoting exchanges and co-operation in various aspects between the two places in the future. Noting that Harbin has been added as one of the Mainland cities eligible for the Individual Visit Scheme since May last year, and that direct flights between Hong Kong and Harbin have been launched, Mr Chan said that the partnerships between the two places have become closer. He expressed his hope for the two cities to work together to explore more co-operation opportunities. In addition, Mr Chan mentioned that the HKSAR Government is steadfastly carrying out the work of patriotic education, including organising more Mainland exchange and study tours. He said he expected more Hong Kong young people to visit Harbin for exchanges and study, with an aim of enhancing Hong Kong young people's sense of identity with, sense of belonging to, and pride towards the country.

  Mr Chan will conclude his visit and return to Hong Kong this afternoon."

 A spokesperson for the Security Bureau today (July 16) said, ""According to the Decision of the National People's Congress on Establishing and Improving the Legal System and Enforcement Mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to Safeguard National Security and the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has the constitutional responsibility to continue to improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security steadily so as to continue to prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security effectively. The Prison Rules (PR) have been in operation for many years. We need to review whether the PR can meet the needs of safeguarding national security and modern correctional institution management.""

 The spokesperson added, ""Having reviewed the relevant law enforcement experience in the past in respect of custody of convicted persons in custody (PICs) and prisoners awaiting trial, potential national security risks and security threats that may be faced by correctional institutions in the future, and relevant law and practices in other jurisdictions (including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore), we propose to improve the extant PR, so as to ensure that we can effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security; continue to strengthen the legal basis for correctional officers in discharging their duties; maintain the security, good order and discipline of prisons; and facilitate the rehabilitation of PICs and protect their lawful rights and interests. We also put forward other amendments to strengthen the enforcement effectiveness of the Correctional Services Department. At the same time, we have reviewed and will amend other provisions with a view to making the PR more up-to-date and meeting the needs for the management of correctional institutions.

 ""Amidst the present complicated geopolitical situation, national security risks still exist. It is necessary to amend the PR as soon as possible to prevent and resolve relevant risks in a timely manner, the earlier the better, for safeguarding national security effectively.

 ""The Amendment Rules will be tabled at the Legislative Council (LegCo) for negative vetting on July 23. The Government will proactively facilitate the scrutiny work of the LegCo, with a view to further strengthening the solid defence in safeguarding national security."""

立法會四題：應對經濟下行的措施,2025-07-16 13:22,2025-07-16 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600376.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的答覆：

問題：

據報本港今年上半年已有300家企業結業，不少企業正面對周轉困難，部分甚至被銀行追討貸款（俗稱「call loan」），不少商界人士憂慮，一旦政府未能扭轉財赤，將大幅加稅；有學者推算政府或需調高薪俸稅稅率至百分之廿六點五，才有望達至收支平衡；在經濟前景未明、工作收入不穩、生活和稅務支出大增下，市民投資信心及消費意欲被直接壓抑。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否檢視自本年度《財政預算案》發布至今，政府財赤有否收窄跡象，以及未來發債額度有否縮減空間；

（二）因應上述商界及市民對經濟及加稅憂慮，當局有何政策或措施穩定各界信心；可否明確承諾不會加稅；及

（三）據報，本港某大地產發展商及多間中小型發展商均面對經營危機，部分甚至出現債務違約和面臨倒閉，外國傳媒更以「大到不能倒」形容某大發展商，其一旦倒閉勢對本地銀行造成嚴重危機，政府有否評估一旦發展商連番倒閉對銀行體系、經濟結構、失業率、市民投資信心、消費意欲，以至政府收入將出現甚麼負面影響，以及有否制訂應對措施？

答覆：

主席：

就謝偉俊議員的提問，我會首先簡介香港最新的整體經濟情況和政府的公共財政策略。

香港經濟穩健增長，二○二四全年實質本地生產總值升幅為百分之二點五，二○二五年第一季則按年上升百分之三點一，較七大工業國二○二五年第一季的平均升幅百分之一點五明顯為高。股市方面，恒生指數上半年累計上升百分之二十。股市交投和新股市場活躍，上半年每日平均成交額約為2,402億元，較去年同期增長百分之一百一十八；上半年集資額超過1,070億元，已較去年全年多約百分之二十二，暫列全球第一。然而，由於旅客和市民的消費模式轉變，一些行業，例如傳統零售和餐飲業，仍面對較大挑戰。

在公共財政方面，二○二五至二六年度《財政預算案》提出了強化財政整合計劃，以節流為主、開源為輔，逐步把政府帳目回復平衡。根據中期財政預測，政府的經營帳目在二○二五至二六年度大致達致平衡，並從二○二六至二七年度起恢復盈餘；非經營帳目由於提速推展北部都會區及其他與經濟民生相關的基本工程，預計在中期預測期內均會出現赤字，但赤字由二○二六至二七年度開始逐年下降。計入發行債券淨所得後，政府綜合帳目在二○二八至二九年度起將恢復盈餘。

謝議員提出的問題涵蓋範圍廣泛，經諮詢相關政策局和香港金融管理局（金管局）後，現回覆如下：

（一）財政赤字及發債額度

本財政年度的政府預算綜合赤字為670億元。由於薪俸稅及利得稅等主要收入均大多在財政年度的後期收取，在現階段推測全年財政狀況屬言之尚早。不過由於上半年股市成交增加，帶動印花稅收入上升，對政府財政帶來幫助。至於政府發債額度方面，我們計劃未來五年每年在「政府可持續債券計劃」及「基礎建設債券計劃」下發行合共約1,500億至1,950億元的政府債券，本財政年度的發債規模預計為1,500億元，我們現階段無意改變此目標。

（二）經濟及稅務政策

政府一直多管齊下協助企業面對經濟轉型的挑戰，加強企業發展業務的信心。在資金周轉方面，政府透過中小企融資擔保計劃（計劃）為中小企業提供信貸擔保，協助它們取得商業貸款。政府亦因應市場和科技發展趨勢，透過「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」（「BUD專項基金」）及其下的「電商易」、「市場推廣及工商機構支援基金」等，協助企業（特別是中小企業）升級轉型及開拓內地和海外市場。

我必須強調，政府在過去幾年並無大幅加稅，現時也沒有大幅加稅的計劃。本年度《財政預算案》提出的財政整合計劃強化版，亦是以節流為主，開源為輔。開源方面，我們的原則是保持香港簡單低稅制的競爭優勢，盡量避免大幅調升稅率或引入新稅種；在增加收入時盡量體現「用者自付」和「能者多付」的原則。香港一直實行的簡單低稅政策，是香港的核心競爭力之一。最近國際管理發展學院發布的《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港的競爭力位列全球第三，其中「稅務政策」的排名全球第一。與此同時，政府繼續在不同範疇策略性地利用稅務措施，促進產業和多元經濟發展，提升香港的營商環境和競爭力。本年度《財政預算案》亦宣布為合資格大宗商品貿易商提供半稅優惠，以帶動海運服務業發展。我們亦計劃今年內就有關基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的稅務優惠制訂方案，以推動資產及財富管理業的發展。

（三）地產相關貸款對銀行體系的影響

金管局一直密切監察香港銀行業穩健發展，本地銀行的總資本比率和主要銀行的平均流動性覆蓋比率在本年三月底分別為百分之二十四點二和百分之一百八十二點五，遠高於國際標準。整體而言，本地地產發展及物業投資相關信貸風險可控。香港銀行對本地地產發展及投資貸款的風險敞口，大部分是面向財政狀況相對良好的大型本地企業。至於本地中小型地產發展商及投資者的風險敞口，包括一些財政狀況較弱或資產負債比率較高的發展商及投資者，銀行早年已經採取了信貸風險緩衝措施，有關貸款大部分均有抵押品。此外，銀行並沒有對單一借貸人過度集中。

銀行整體資產質素風險可控，撥備維持充足。截至本年三月底，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率（即一般和特殊準備金總和相對呆壞帳餘額的比率）約百分之六十，若將抵押品變現價值從呆壞帳餘額中扣除，銀行信貸撥備覆蓋率約百分之一百四十五。金管局會繼續密切留意環球經濟和貿易情況，以及房地產市場發展和風險變化，並與銀行業界保持緊密溝通，致力維持銀行體系穩健。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Measures to cope with economic downturn,2025-07-16 13:22,2025-07-16 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600378.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

  It has been reported that 300 enterprises in Hong Kong have ceased operation over the first half of this year. Quite a number of enterprises are facing cash flow difficulties, and some are even having their loan called in by the bank (an operation commonly known as ""call loan""). Many members of the business sector are worried that, once unable to reverse the fiscal deficit, the Government will raise taxes significantly. Some academics have projected that the Government may need to raise the salaries tax rate to 26.5 per cent before fiscal balance can hopefully be achieved. Against a backdrop of uncertain economic prospects, instability in work income, and substantial increase in living and tax expenses, the public's investment confidence and desire for consumption have been directly suppressed. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has examined if there are signs that the Government's fiscal deficit has narrowed since the release of this year's Budget and if there is room to reduce bond issuance volumes in the future;

(2) in the light of the aforesaid worries of the business sector and members of the public about the economy and tax hikes, what policies or measures are put in place by the authorities to stabilise the confidence of various sectors; whether it can explicitly commit to not raising taxes; and

(3) as it has been reported that a certain major property developer and a number of small and medium-sized developers in Hong Kong are facing operational crises, with some even defaulting on debts and being on the verge of closure, and foreign media have even described a certain major developer as ""too big to fail"", so much so that in the event of a closure, it stands to pose a serious crisis to local banks, whether the Government has assessed the negative impact on the banking system, economic structure, unemployment rate, public confidence in investment, consumer sentiment and even government revenue in the event of successive closures of developers, and whether it has formulated counter-measures?

Reply:

President,

  Regarding the question raised by the Hon Paul Tse, I will first give a brief account of the latest developments of Hong Kong's overall economic situation and the Government's public finance strategies.

  The Hong Kong economy grew solidly. Real gross domestic product rose by 2.5 per cent in the full year of 2024 and the year-on-year increase in the first quarter of 2025 is 3.1 per cent, which is significantly higher than the 1.5 per cent average growth of G7 countries in the first quarter of 2025. As regards the stock market, the Hang Seng Index surged by a cumulative 20 per cent in the first half of the year. Our stock market trading as well as initial public offering was active. The average daily turnover for the first half of the year was around $240.2 billion, an increase of 118 per cent when compared with the same period last year. More than $107 billion was raised in the first half of the year, approximately 22 per cent more than the full-year total for last year and ranking first globally in the year-to-date. Nevertheless, certain sectors, such as traditional retail and catering, are still facing greater challenges due to changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents.

  On public finances, the 2025-26 Budget outlined a reinforced fiscal consolidation programme, focusing primarily on expenditure control, supplemented by revenue generation, to gradually restore balance to government accounts. According to the Medium Range Forecast (MRF), the Government's Operating Account will largely achieve balance in 2025-26 and return to a surplus starting from 2026-27. The Capital Account is estimated to record a deficit in the MRF period due to the accelerated development of the Northern Metropolis and other capital works projects relating to the economy and people's livelihood. Nevertheless, the level of deficit will decline year-on-year from 2026-27 onwards. After taking account of net proceeds from the issuance of bonds, the Consolidated Accounts will return to a surplus starting from 2028-29.

  As the question raised by Hon Paul Tse covers a wide range of issues, we have prepared a reply in consultation with the relevant bureaux and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) as follows:

(1) Fiscal deficit and size of bond issuance

  A consolidated deficit of $67 billion is expected for this financial year. Due to the fact that some major types of revenue including salaries and profits taxes are mostly received towards the end of a financial year, it is premature at this juncture to project our full-year financial results. Nevertherless, the increase in trading volume of the stock market in the first half of the year has led to an increase in stamp duty revenue, rendering support to our public finances. Regarding the size of bond issuance, we have planned to issue a total of about $150 billion to $195 billion worth of bonds per annum under the Government Sustainable Bond Programme and the Infrastructure Bond Programme in the next five years. The size of bond issuance for the current financial year is estimated to be $150 billion. We have no intention to change this target at the present stage.

(2) Economic and tax policy

  The Government has all along been adopting a multi-pronged approach to assist enterprises in meeting the challenges of economic restructuring, with a view to reinforcing their confidence in pursuing business development. As regards cash flow pressure, the Government helps small and medium enterprises (SMEs) obtain commercial loans by providing loan guarantees through the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme. Moreover, in the light of market and technological development trends, the Government supports enterprises (particularly SMEs) through Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund), including its E-commerce Easy, the Export Marketing and Trade and Industrial Organisation Support Fund, etc, in upgrading and transformation, as well as tapping into the Mainland and overseas markets.

  It must be emphasised that the Government did not raise taxes substantially in the past few years, and has no plan to raise taxes substantially at present. The reinforced fiscal consolidation programme outlined in this year's Budget also focuses primarily on expenditure control, to be supplemented by revenue generation. On identifying new revenue sources, our principles are to maintain the competitiveness of Hong Kong's simple and low tax regime by avoiding considerable increase in tax rates or introduction of new taxes, and to uphold the ""user pays"" and ""affordable users pay"" principles as far as practicable whilst increasing revenue. The simple and low tax policy that Hong Kong has all alone been pursuing is one of Hong Kong's core competitiveness. In the latest World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 published by the International Institute for Management Development, Hong Kong's competitiveness ranks third globally, in which Hong Kong tops the ranking in ""tax policy"". Meanwhile, the Government continues to make strategic use of tax measures in different areas to promote the development of our industries and economic diversification, as well as to enhance Hong Kong's business environment and competitiveness. As announced in this year's Budget, we will provide half-rate tax concession for eligible commodity traders to drive the development of maritime services. It is also our plan to formulate proposals on the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and carried interest this year to foster the development of the asset and wealth management industries.

(3) Property related loans' impact on banking system

  The HKMA has been closely monitoring the healthy development of Hong Kong's banking sector. The Total Capital Ratio of locally-incorporated banks and the average Liquidity Coverage Ratio of the major banks were 24.2 per cent and 182.5 per cent respectively as at end-March this year, well above international standards. Overall, the credit risk associated with local property development and investment loans is manageable. A significant portion of the Hong Kong banks' exposures relating to local property development and investment loans are to the large players with relatively good financial health. For exposures to small and medium-sized local property developers and investors, including some with weaker financials or higher gearing, banks have already taken credit risk mitigating measures early on, and most of these loans are secured. Besides, there is no concentration of risks at individual borrower level.

  The overall asset quality of the banking system is manageable and provisions remain sufficient. The provision coverage ratio (i.e. total of general and specific provisions as a percentage of non-performing loans) stand at around 60 per cent as at end-March this year. If taking into account and deducting the market value of collateral from the non-performing loans, the adjusted provision coverage ratio would be about 145 per cent. The HKMA will strive to maintain a sound banking system by continuing to keep a close watch on the global economic and trade conditions as well as the development of and risk changes in the real estate market, and maintaining close communication with the banking sector.

  Thank you, President."
立法會一題：疏導陸路口岸的人流,2025-07-16 13:14,2025-07-16 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600384.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上林順潮議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的答覆︰

問題：

據報本年四月訪港內地旅客數字按年增長百分之十三，而政府於去年一月回應本人質詢時表示，會就重要節日延長口岸開放時間與內地部門保持緊密溝通，其後亦表示會進一步檢視會否延長部分口岸平日的通關時間。關於疏導陸路口岸的人流，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於近月有數個大型演唱會同日舉行，完場後有大批旅客經落馬洲口岸過境，人潮持續至凌晨，政府會否考慮於大型演唱會舉行日子，延長羅湖口岸的通關時間至翌日凌晨二時，並相應延長港鐵東鐵綫服務，以提升來港觀賞演唱會旅客的旅遊體驗；

（二）會否盡快與內地部門商討，延長香園圍管制站及落馬洲支線管制站的通關時間；及

（三）鑑於香園圍管制站在平日及假日的客流已比設計容量超出逾倍，政府有否考慮推出長遠措施以疏導人流，例如再加建自助出入境檢查系統e-‍道，令數量增加至與內地方面相若？

答覆：

主席：

隨着粵港市民跨境往來愈趨頻繁，民間交流亦愈見緊密。除了港人喜歡在周末或長假期到內地旅遊，我們亦樂見內地訪港旅客人數持續上升。今年上半年，約2360萬訪港旅客人次中，內地旅客佔逾七成，約1 780萬人次，按年增加一成，當中不少是來港參與國際娛樂及體育盛事活動。面對持續增長的通關需求，特區政府一直密切監察各邊境管制站的運作，並積極提升口岸通關能力，便利香港與內地居民雙向奔赴。

就林順潮議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局及文化體育及旅遊局後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）為了讓參與大型演唱會的市民和旅客獲得更佳體驗，各相關部門和機構會就每個大型演唱會商討各項細節安排，例如根據演唱會人數、性質、結束時間和票務情況等因素進行評估及人手資源部署，制定並落實人流管控、信息發布、交通疏導及口岸安排。

總結過去運作經驗，為更有效疏導大型演唱會結束後經陸路離境的旅客，口岸部門會就大型演唱會作超前部署，預先評估跨境旅客流量並作出相應安排，例如入境事務處（入境處）會因應旅客流量估算適當調配人手加強服務、運輸署會提前與港鐵、本地及跨境公共交通營辦商協調，按預測人流加密班次，並與主辦單位協調，預先透過社交平台以及在演唱會當日場館內發布過境交通資訊。相關部門亦會實時監察各管制站的情況，靈活調配人手加開檢查櫃枱及通道，並與內地口岸相關部門透過已建立的口岸熱線及即時通報機制緊密聯繫，確保口岸運作暢順。

晚間大型演唱會完結後，跨境旅客可經羅湖管制站、深圳灣口岸、落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋香港口岸過關。就落馬洲／皇崗口岸，我們留意到跨境旅客主要於大型演唱會結束約45分鐘後陸續抵達口岸，回內地人潮大致於1.5小時內疏導完成。據最近觀察所得，大型演唱會完結後，相關邊境管制站過境人流較多，但運作大致暢順有序。整體而言，現時邊境管制站的服務可配合旅客需求。

延長通關時間牽涉兩地口岸運作，須審慎考慮一籃子因素，包括實際需要、兩地資源的有效運用、人手安排及交通配套等。在現行落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋香港口岸提供24小時旅客出入境清關服務基礎上，我們會繼續密切留意旅客通關需求，視乎實際需要適時與內地有關當局協商延長個別口岸的旅檢通關服務時間。

（三）香園圍邊境管制站作為首個採用「人車直達」設計的管制站，自二○二三年二月開始客運通關服務後一直深受市民歡迎。今年截至六月，該管制站日均出入境人次為約78000人次，周末及假期期間，日均出入境人次超過91000人次，是管制站設計流量的三倍。

為提升香園圍管制站的通關能力及效率，相關部門一直採取各項措施，包括靈活調配人手、優化工作流程，以及善用資訊科技等。入境處已於去年六月將該管制站入境大堂的部分傳統櫃枱改建，令入境大堂的e-道數目由14條增至18條，傳統櫃枱數目由九個增至12個。

因應旅客流量持續增長，入境處現正於該管制站離境大堂進行優化工程，工程完成後e-道數目將由14條增至18條。於工程期間，入境處於離境大堂增設了四個臨時櫃枱，務求將工程影響減至最低。我們並正研究進一步增加e-道及傳統櫃枱的數目。

最後，我呼籲旅客及市民留意政府於不同平台發布的資訊，預先查閱入境處、運輸署及深圳和珠海當局的相關網頁、流動應用程式及小程式等，了解口岸過關狀況，盡量錯峰出行，減省輪候時間。我們並會與相關部門研究進一步優化網上發布的口岸資訊，便利市民預早規劃行程。"
LCQ1: Managing passenger flows at land boundary control points,2025-07-16 13:14,2025-07-16 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600385.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Dennis Lam and a reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

It has been reported that the number of Mainland visitors to Hong Kong in April this year grew by 13 per cent year-on-year. In response to my question in January last year, the Government indicated that it would maintain close liaison with Mainland authorities regarding the extension of operating hours at boundary control points (BCPs) during major festive periods. Subsequently, the Government also indicated that it would further review whether immigration clearance hours at certain BCPs on weekdays would be extended. On managing passenger flow at land BCPs, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that several large-scale concerts have been held on the same day in recent months, resulting in large crowds of visitors crossing the border via the Lok Ma Chau Control Point after the events, with the flow of people continuing into the early hours, whether the Government will consider extending immigration clearance hours at the Lo Wu Control Point until 2am the following day on days when large-scale concerts take place, and correspondingly extending the service hours of the MTR East Rail Line, so as to enhance the travel experience for visitors coming to Hong Kong to attend concerts;

(2) whether it will expeditiously discuss with Mainland authorities the extension of immigration clearance hours at the Heung Yuen Wai Control Point and the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point; and

(3) given that the passenger flow at the Heung Yuen Wai Control Point has exceeded its design capacity by more than double on both weekdays and holidays, whether the Government has considered introducing long-term measures to manage passenger flow, such as installing additional Automated Immigration Clearance (e-Channel) services, so as to increase their number to a level comparable with that of the Mainland counterpart?

Reply:

President,

With the increasing cross-boundary passenger flow between Guangdong and Hong Kong, exchanges at the community level have also intensified. In addition to the popularity of travelling to the Mainland during weekends or long holidays among Hong Kong residents, we are also pleased to observe a sustained increase in the number of Mainland visitors to Hong Kong. In the first half of this year, of the around 23.6 million inbound passenger trips to Hong Kong, Mainland visitors accounted for over 70 per cent, that is around 17.8 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 10 per cent. Many of these visitors came to Hong Kong to attend international entertainment and sports events. In view of the growing demand for clearance services, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been closely monitoring the operation of the boundary control points (BCPs) and proactively enhancing the clearance capacity to facilitate the two-way flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, a reply to the questions raised by Dr the Hon Dennis Lam is as follows:

(1) and (2) To enhance the experience of both residents and visitors attending large-scale concerts, relevant Government departments and organisations will discuss the detailed arrangements for each large-scale concert, including assessment and deployment of manpower resources, formulation and implementation of plans for crowd control, information dissemination, traffic diversion and control point arrangements etc based on factors such as the number of attendees, nature, ending time and ticketing situations of the concerts.

Drawing on past operational experiences, relevant departments will make advance planning for large-scale concerts, including pre-assessing the cross-boundary passenger traffic and making corresponding arrangements with a view to effectively managing the passengers departing through land BCPs following large-scale concerts. For example, the Immigration Department (ImmD) will deploy manpower as appropriate to strengthen services based on the estimated passenger traffic. The Transport Department (TD) will co-ordinate in advance with the MTR Corporation, as well as local and cross-boundary public transport operators, to increase service frequency based on the projected passenger flow. Additionally, co-ordination will be undertaken with concert organisers to disseminate cross-boundary traffic information in advance via social media platforms, as well as inside the venues on the day of the concerts. Relevant departments will also monitor the real-time situations at various BCPs, make flexible deployment of manpower to operate additional clearance counters and channels, and maintain close liaison with relevant Mainland port authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanism to ensure smooth operation of the BCPs.

Following the end of large-scale evening concerts, cross-boundary passengers may undergo immigration clearance via the Lo Wu Control Point, Shenzhen Bay Port, Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port and Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Port. For the LMC/HG Port, it is observed that most cross-boundary passengers begin arriving approximately 45 minutes after the end of large-scale concerts, with the northbound passenger flow generally dispersed within 1.5 hours. According to recent observations, although cross-boundary passenger flow at relevant BCPs has increased following large-scale concerts, operations have remained largely smooth and in order. Overall speaking, the existing services at the BCPs are able to meet with the passenger demand.

The extension of operating hours of clearance services involves the operation of the ports on both Mainland and Hong Kong sides, and careful consideration has to be given to a host of factors, including the actual needs, effective utilisation of resources of both places, manpower arrangements and ancillary transport services. On the basis of the 24-hour passenger clearance services currently provided at the LMC/HG Port and the HZMB Hong Kong Port, we will continue to closely monitor the demand for passenger clearance services and, having regard to actual needs, liaise with the relevant Mainland authorities on extending the operating hours of the passenger clearance services at respective BCPs when necessary.

(3) As the first control point adopting the design of ""direct access to people and vehicles"", the Heung Yuen Wai (HYW) BCP has been well received by the public since the commissioning of passenger clearance services in February 2023. As at June this year, the daily average cross-boundary passenger traffic at the HYW BCP was about 78000 passenger trips, and during weekends and holidays, the daily average exceeded 91000passenger trips, which was three times of its design flow.

Relevant departments have been taking various measures, including flexible deployment of manpower, optimisation of workflow and effective use of information technology, to enhance the handling capacity and efficiency of the HYW BCP. In June last year, the ImmD converted some of the traditional counters in the passenger arrival hall of the HYWBCP, thereby increasing the number of e-Channels from 14 to 18 and expanding the number of traditional counters from 9 to 12.

In response to the continued growth in passenger traffic, the ImmD is now carrying out enhancement works at the passenger departure hall of the HYW BCP. Upon completion, the number of e-Channels will be increased from 14 to 18. During the construction period, four temporary counters have been set up in the passenger departure hall to minimise the impact of the works. We are also exploring the possibility of further increasing the number of e-Channels and traditional counters.

Lastly, I appeal to both visitors and residents to pay attention to the information released by the Government on various platforms. They are suggested to check in advance the relevant websites, mobile applications and mini programmes of the ImmD and the TD, as well as those of the Shenzhen and Zhuhai authorities, so as to understand the clearance situations at various BCPs and to avoid making their journeys during peak hours to save waiting time. We will also work with relevant departments to explore further enhancements to the online dissemination of information of BCPs, with a view to facilitating early journey planning by the public."

立法會二題：推動低空經濟產業安全健康發展,2025-07-16 12:48,2025-07-16 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600240.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上陳紹雄議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

國家發展和改革委員會早前強調在嚴控風險及確保安全的前提下，分類有序拓展低空經濟應用場景。行政長官亦表示特區政府將推動低空經濟產業安全健康發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於建構一套「看得見、管得住」的全數字化低空空域管理系統，是管控多種類、高密度、高頻次飛空器在空域安全有序飛行的關鍵要素，政府有否建構有關系統的時間表；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於有意見指出低空經濟所衍生的數據具高經濟價值，而數據安全會直接影響空域的使用效率和安全性，政府會否研究建立數據安全體系，推進低空數據的標準化管理和安全高效使用，並促進其價值轉化；及

（三）會否借鑑內地及世界各地的發展經驗，量化分析低空基建設施及關聯產業所創造的經濟效益，制訂以公私營協作模式興建該等設施的方案，以吸引更多基建投資；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

低空經濟是國家戰略性新興產業，也是發展新質生產力的範例。低空經濟要「飛得遠」，先要「飛得穩」。因此，安全必然是發展低空經濟的先決條件。

就陳議員的提問，經諮詢創新科技及工業局、發展局及民航處後，現答覆如下：

（一）完善的低空基建設施是確保低空飛行活動安全有序運行的重要元素。鑑於香港高樓密集且地形多變的獨特城市地貌，低空運作環境具挑戰性。構建數字化的低空基礎設施，尤其是智能化的低空交通管理系統，以及制訂全面的數據政策，是確保低空經濟產業安全、高效及可持續發展的關鍵。

政府將基於「監管沙盒」試點計劃的經驗，制訂智能低空交通管理系統的概念設計與技術規範的工作。為落實這些規劃，政府將於今年內開展技術研究，借鑑內地及國際先進案例，確保智能低空交通管理系統等低空基建配套設施的技術參數設計能與區域及國際監管標準兼容。

（二）低空經濟的推進將產生大量數據資源，例如無人機操作期間所收集的飛行數據，其安全與高效運用直接影響產業的發展潛力。就政府各個系統所衍生的數據管理及安全，現時相關局／部門須遵循《政府資訊科技保安政策及指引》的規定，包括加密傳輸中和存儲中的資料、不可於公有雲平台存儲敏感及個人資料，以及定期為其資訊系統進行保安風險評估和審計及私隱影響評估，以確保數據安全可靠及符合適用的法例法規，包括與個人資料有關的私隱保護措施要求。

在上述前提下及根據政府的開放數據政策，透過低空經濟項目所產生的數據均可視乎情況利用現有的開放數據平台及空間數據共享平台等數字基礎設施向外公開，促進更多低空經濟相關的應用及產業發展。事實上，目前不少有利低空經濟發展的數據，例如地圖、航空照片、三維空間數據、建築物數據、交通數據及天氣數據等，已經透過上述政府數據平台與業界分享，便利社會各界開拓更多低空飛行活動的應用場景，釋放相關數據的潛在價值。

另外，發展局、地政總署及相關部門亦會共同探討透過一個低空經濟專屬平台共享相關數據的可行性，透過建設一個專門用於低空飛行活動的三維資訊樞紐，作為試點項目為共享無人機收集得來的數據進行概念驗證。該樞紐將參考內地的數據共享模式，緊密銜接發展局開發的空間數據共享平台，以統一和整合來自不同來源的數據，並配備相關的資料儀表板，從而實現政府與低空飛行相關持份者之間的專題資訊共享。

（三）低空基礎設施的發展是一項前瞻性的系統工程，透過政府引導及跨領域協作，可加速產業升級並推動低空經濟蓬勃發展。除政府資源投入外，我們相信私人市場的參與亦是不可或缺的動力，例如在建設起降點、無線電流動通訊網絡規劃等方面。我們將參考內地及其他地區的經驗和採取的不同模式，按部就班地開展低空經濟基礎建設的相關工作。在此過程中，政府會在保障航空和公眾安全為核心前提下，探討各項有利發展低空經濟的多元運作模式，以促進長遠經濟效益。

現時，政府透過「監管沙盒」試點項目測試各種低空飛行的應用場景、技術和場地要求以及跨部門的規管協調，以收集數據和累積經驗，探討發展低空經濟所需的基礎設施、安全要求，以及法例規管框架，為低空經濟發展規劃，包括建設低空經濟基礎設施的可行模式，提供不同應用場景的試行經驗和實證基礎。我們的願景是，政府透過頂層設計、標準制定與制度創新營造有利生態的同時，私營企業可憑藉技術突破與商業模式創新驅動產業發展。此公私協作模式將為香港開拓可持續性的低空經濟發展格局。

多謝主席。"
LCQ2: Promoting safe and healthy development of low-altitude economy industries,2025-07-16 12:48,2025-07-16 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600241.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Siu-hung and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

The National Development and Reform Commission has earlier on emphasised the expansion of application scenarios for low-altitude economic activities in a well-classified and orderly manner, on the premise that risks be stringently controlled and safety be ensured. On promoting the safe and healthy development of the low-altitude economy industries, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the establishment of a ""visible and manageable"" fully digitalised low-altitude airspace management system is a key element in managing and controlling the safe and orderly flights of a wide range of high-traffic-density and high-frequency aircrafts in the airspace, whether the Government has a timetable for the establishment of the system concerned; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as there are views pointing out that the data derived from the low-‍altitude economy have high economic values, and data security will have a direct impact on the efficiency and safety of the use of airspace, whether the Government will study the establishment of a data security system to promote standardised management and the safe and efficient use of low-altitude data, as well as to facilitate the transformation of data value; and

(3) whether it will, by drawing reference from the development experience in the Mainland and other places around the world, conduct quantitative analysis on the economic benefits brought about by low-altitude infrastructure and the related industries, and formulate a plan for development of such facilities through a public-‍private partnership approach, so as to attract more infrastructure investments; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Low-altitude economy (LAE) is a national strategic emerging industry and an example of developing new quality productive forces. For LAE to ""fly far"", it must first ""fly steady"". Therefore, safety is undoubtedly a prerequisite for LAE development.

In consultation with the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Civil Aviation Department, the reply to the Hon Chan's question is as follows:

(1) Robust low-altitude infrastructure is a critical element in ensuring the safe and orderly operation of low-altitude flying activities. Given Hong Kong's unique urban landscape characterised by dense high-rise buildings and varied terrain, the low-altitude operating environment is particularly challenging. The establishment of digitalised low-altitude infrastructure, particularly the Smart Low-altitude Traffic Management System, coupled with the formulation of a comprehensive data policy, is essential to ensuring the safe, efficient, and sustainable development of LAE.

Building on the experience gathered from the Regulatory Sandbox (Sandbox) pilot projects, the Government will formulate the conceptual model and technical specifications for a Smart Low-altitude Traffic Management System. To implement these plans, the Government will commence a technical study within this year, drawing on the Mainland and international advanced practices to ensure that the technical parameters of low-altitude infrastructure, including the Smart Low-altitude Traffic Management System, are compatible with regional and international regulatory standards.

(2) The development of LAE will generate significant volumes of data resources such as flight data collected during unmanned aircraft operations, the secure and efficient utilisation of which will directly affect the industry's development potential. In respect of data management and data security of government systems, the relevant bureaux and departments (B/Ds) at present must comply with the Government IT Security Policy and Guidelines, which require for example encrypting data both in transit and at rest, prohibiting the storage of sensitive and personal data on public cloud platforms, and conducting regular security risk assessments and audits as well as privacy impact assessments for B/Ds' information systems. These measures aim to ensure that data are kept secure and reliable and meet all applicable legislative and regulatory requirements, including requirements on privacy protection of personal data.

Given the above and in accordance with the open data policy of the Government, data collected by LAE projects can, depending on the circumstances, be made available to the public via the existing digital infrastructures such as the Open Data Portal and the Common Spatial Data Infrastructure Portal (CSDI), thereby fostering more LAE-related applications and industry development. In fact, a considerable amount of data beneficial to the development of the LAE, e.g. maps, aerial photographs, 3D spatial data, building data, traffic data and weather data, etc, has already been shared with the industry through the aforementioned government data platforms, facilitating various sectors to explore more application scenarios of low-altitude flying activities and unlock the full potential of the data.

Furthermore, the DEVB, the Lands Department and relevant departments will jointly explore the feasibility of sharing LAE-related data through a unified platform, and build a three-dimensional information hub dedicated to low-altitude flying activities as a pilot project to conduct a proof-of-concept for sharing data collected by unmanned aircraft. This hub will make reference to the data sharing model of the Mainland and closely connect with the CSDI developed by the DEVB to unify and integrate data from different sources, and be equipped with relevant data dashboards to enable thematic information sharing between the Government and relevant stakeholders relating to low-altitude flying activities.

(3) The development of low-altitude infrastructure is a forward-looking systematic project. Through government guidance and cross-sector collaboration, it can accelerate industrial upgrading and drive the robust growth of LAE. In addition to the investment of government resources, we believe that private market participation is also an indispensable driving force, particularly in areas such as the construction of takeoff/landing sites and the planning of mobile radio communications network. Drawing reference from the experiences and various models adopted in the Mainland and other regions, we will proceed step-by-step in taking forward the relevant work on the development of LAE infrastructure. Throughout this process, the Government will, on the premises of safeguarding aviation and public safety, explore various operational models conducive to the development of LAE to foster long-term economic benefits.

At present, the Government is testing different low-altitude flying application scenarios, technical and site requirements, and cross-departmental regulatory co-ordination through the Sandbox pilot projects. The aims are to gather data, accumulate experience, and examine the infrastructure, safety standards, and legislative and regulatory framework necessary for LAE development, thereby providing trial experience and evidence-based foundation of various application scenarios for the planning of LAE development, including the feasible models for the construction of LAE infrastructure. Our vision is that while the Government creates a favourable ecosystem through top-level design, standard-setting, and institutional innovation, the private sector will drive industrial advancement through technological breakthrough and business model innovation. This public-private collaboration model will pave the way for the sustainable development of LAE in Hong Kong.

Thank you, President."
ICAC to complement national anti-graft policy and scale new heights following fruitful golden jubilee year,2025-07-16 12:35,2025-07-16 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600309.htm,"The following press release is issued on behalf of the Independent Commission Against Corruption:

Following a fruitful year that marked its golden jubilee, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is set to complement the country's development and anti-graft policy, continue to combat corruption at full throttle and uphold Hong Kong's integrity and rule of law to achieve greater success in the next 50 years, according to the 2024 ICAC Annual Report issued today (July 16).

Tabling the 2024 ICAC Annual Report at the Legislative Council today, Hon Chan Kin-por, Member of the Executive Council and the Legislature, and Chairman of the ICAC's Advisory Committee on Corruption, noted that 2024 marked a major milestone as the Commission celebrated its 50th anniversary. He commended the ICAC for its relentless pursuit of breakthroughs in local and international anti-corruption initiatives last year, widening and fostering graft-fighting collaborations at home and abroad to showcase the good stories of Hong Kong. He added that the city was globally acclaimed for its performance in the fight against corruption.

Hong Kong ranked 17th out of 180 countries and territories in the Corruption Perceptions Index 2024 released by the Transparency International and was one of the top performers in the Asia-Pacific region. In the latest World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong's competitiveness improved by two places to the third. Under the indicator ""bribery and corruption do not exist"", Hong Kong ranked forth globally and topped the Asia-Pacific region. The results bore clear testimony to the ICAC's effective work strategy, as well as the robust rule of law and anti-corruption regime of Hong Kong.

In the 2024 ICAC Annual Report, the ICAC Commissioner, Mr Woo Ying-ming remarked that with Hong Kong's unique advantage of being backed by the motherland and connected to the world, the Commission had strengthened collaboration with anti-corruption counterparts worldwide and contributed significantly to the global graft-fighting cause through the tripartite partnership formed with the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (IAACA) and the Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption (HKIAAC).

""Fighting corruption is both a national policy and a common goal around the globe. With a vision of becoming a world-acclaimed exemplar in the graft-fighting arena, the ICAC strives to entrench the reputation of Hong Kong as a city of probity and continues to push forward the anti-corruption cause globally through the tripartite partnership with the IAACA and the HKIAAC. We will continue to tell the good stories of our motherland, the 'one country, two systems' principle and Hong Kong, and look forward to achieving greater successes in the next 50 years,"" Mr Woo noted.

The ICAC and the IAACA, of which Mr Woo serves as President, hosted the 8th ICAC Symposium last year. The event gathered over 500 representatives from 180 anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies of nearly 60 jurisdictions in Hong Kong, setting a record in the history of the ICAC. At the Symposium, the IAACA adopted the first-ever international anti-corruption declaration named after Hong Kong, fully manifesting the ICAC's significant status and influence on the global stage.

Established by the ICAC in February last year, the HKIAAC hosted professional anti-corruption training for over 2 200 graft-fighters from more than 70 countries in just one year. The HKIAAC was accredited as a Qualifications Framework Level 5 operator by the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications in late 2024. The achievement affirmed the professionalism and credibility of training courses run by the HKIAAC.

During the year, the ICAC also signed Memoranda of Understanding with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and anti-corruption agencies of six ""Belt and Road"" and other countries to provide a framework to deepen collaboration for combatting and preventing corruption. The ICAC and the UNODC became close strategic partners in the fight against corruption and jointly organised various training programmes. The two parties are working together on a guide on managing corruption risks in prisons, which will serve as reference for prison administrators worldwide.

The ICAC had also adopted a new education and publicity approach and produced creative promotional videos that attracted over 1 million views on social media. Combining education, publicity and the signature ""ICAC coffee"", Café ""1974"" opened its door at the ICAC headquarters last year and received a large number of local, Mainland and overseas visitors, hammering home the probity message to a much broader community.

The ICAC also took the initiative to share its experience in engaging young people in the graft-fighting mission. Based on the ""Policy Guide for National Anti-Corruption Authorities on Meaningful Youth Engagement in Anti-Corruption Work"" (the Guide), a teaching module targeted at graft fighters worldwide was developed by the Commission. In July 2024, with support from the UNODC, the HKIAAC and the IAACA jointly organised a first online seminar to launch the Guide and share practical experiences in engaging young people in anti-corruption work.

Past ICAC Annual Surveys consistently found that members of the public showed zero tolerance towards corruption, and that a culture of integrity had taken root in the society. According to the 2024 Annual Survey, 98.7 per cent of the respondents had not encountered corruption personally in the past year, reaffirming the stable probity situation. In addition, 97.4 per cent of the respondents believed that integrity was important for the development of Hong Kong.

In 2024, the ICAC received a total of 2 058 non-election related corruption complaints, a slight increase by 3 per cent when compared to 2023, showing that the corruption situation in Hong Kong remained stable and under control.

In the public sector, the civil service remained clean and honest. The ICAC completed 63 corruption prevention studies for government departments and public bodies, as a sustained effort to reduce corruption risks in public administration. The Commission also continued to co-organise the ""Ethical Leadership Programme"" with the Civil Service Bureau, and engaged in exchanges with senior to directorate civil servants through programmes offered by Civil Service College, with a view to deepening the probity culture within government departments.

As for the private sector, the ICAC continued to adopt a holistic strategy to strengthen the corruption prevention capabilities of different industries and sustain Hong Kong's clean and fair business environment.

In regard to the building management sector, the ICAC and the Hong Kong Competition Commission conducted a first ever joint operation and successfully cracked down a newly rising syndicate engaged in corruption and bid-rigging of building maintenance projects. In order to encourage the construction industry to continuously promote integrity management, the ICAC and the Construction Industry Council joined hands in introducing the ""Integrity Management Award"" in the Outstanding Contractor Award. As regards the finance and insurance sectors, with the full support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks, the ICAC launched the ""Banking Industry Integrity Charter"" to reinforce Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

The ICAC is committed to upholding clean elections. Under the new electoral arrangement upon improvement of the electoral system and district governance system, the ICAC will remain steadfast and will take robust enforcement actions against any corrupt and illegal conduct at future elections, including the Legislative Council Election to be held in late 2025, so as to ensure that the election be conducted in a fair, open and honest manner.

行政會議成員、立法會議員及廉署貪污問題諮詢委員會主席陳健波今日向立法會提交《廉政公署2024年年報》時指出，二○二四年是廉署成立50周年的重要里程。他讚許廉署去年在本地及國際反貪領域上不斷突破限制，成功擴闊及深化廉署在海內外推動的反貪協作，展現香港好故事，香港的反貪表現亦得到國際認同。

由透明國際發表的《2024年清廉指數》，香港的廉潔程度在全球180個國家及地區中排名第17位，是亞太區最好表現的地區之一。根據最新發布的《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港整體競爭力排名上升兩位至全球第三。在「行賄和貪污不存在」的指標方面，香港位列全球第四，在亞太區踞首，反映廉署工作的成效，也是香港擁有穩健法治及有效反貪制度的實證。

廉政專員胡英明在《廉政公署2024年年報》中表示，廉署透過與國際反貪局聯合會（聯合會）及香港國際廉政學院（廉政學院）組成的「反貪鐵三角」，加上香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，與各地反貪同儕加強伙伴合作，為全球反貪事業作出積極貢獻。

胡英明表示︰「反貪腐是國家政策，也是全球共同目標。廉署以『成為國際公認的反貪典範』為願景，鞏固香港廉潔都會美譽，並會繼續透過廉署與聯合會及廉政學院組成的『反貪鐵三角』，促進全球廉政建設合作，向國際社會說好中國、『一國兩制』及香港的故事，構建廉署下一個更輝煌的50年。」

廉署去年聯同由胡英明出任主席的聯合會合辦「廉政公署第八屆國際會議」，逾500名來自近60個司法管轄區的180個反貪及執法機構代表聚首香港，創下廉署歷史新高。聯合會更在會議上公佈史上首份以香港命名的國際反貪腐宣言，充分展現廉署在國際舞台上的重要地位和影響力。

廉署去年二月成立廉政學院，一年內已為超過70個國家逾2 200名反貪人員提供專業反貪培訓。廉政學院去年底更獲香港學術及職業資歷評審局認可為資歷架構第五級營辦者，充分肯定廉政學院舉辦的培訓課程的專業性和公信力。

此外，廉署過去一年與聯合國毒品和犯罪問題辦公室（聯合國毒罪辦）以及六個「一帶一路」及其他國家的反貪機構簽署諒解備忘錄，為共同打擊及預防貪污提供合作框架。廉署與聯合國毒罪辦成為緊密反貪戰略伙伴，攜手合辦培訓，正合編處理監獄管理貪腐風險的指南，供全球監獄管理人員參考。

廉署又銳意革新宣傳教育策略，創作多條風格嶄新的宣傳視頻，在社交媒體上錄得破紀錄的過百萬點擊。此外，廉署去年在總部大樓內開設了「一九七四」咖啡廳，結合教育、宣傳及「廉署咖啡」概念，成功吸引大量本地、內地及海外訪客慕名而至，擴大倡廉信息的接觸面。

廉署同時積極分享鼓勵青年參與反腐倡廉工作的經驗，以《加強青年參與反貪腐倡議全球政策指南》（《政策指南》）為基礎，編製了一套以全球反貪機構人員為對象的教學單元。在聯合國毒罪辦的支持下，廉政學院與國際反貪局聯合會於二○二四年七月舉辦首場介紹《政策指南》的線上研討會，分享培養青少年參與反貪工作的實戰經驗。

廉署周年民意調查多年來均顯示，市民對貪污抱持「零容忍」態度，反映誠信文化已植根社會。二○二四年民意調查顯示，98.7%受訪者在過去一年內沒有親身遇過貪污，反映香港社會廉潔狀況穩定良好；97.4%受訪者認為社會廉潔對香港發展重要。

廉署二○二四年共接獲2 058宗與選舉無關的貪污投訴，較二○二三年同期微升3%，顯示香港的貪污情況保持平穩受控。

在公營機構方面，公務員隊伍整體廉潔奉公。廉署為政府部門及公共機構完成63份防貪審查工作報告，持續致力減低公共行政範疇的貪污風險。廉署同時繼續與公務員事務局合作推行「誠信領導計劃」，並在公務員學院的課程中與高級至首長級公務員進行交流，深化部門的廉潔文化。

私營機構方面，廉署繼續採取全方位策略，維護香港廉潔公平的營商環境，並加強不同界別的防貪能力。

在樓宇管理業方面，廉署去年首度與香港競爭事務委員會聯合執法，搗破一個新冒起的樓宇維修貪污圍標集團。建造業方面，廉署聯同建造業議會於「傑出承建商大獎」增設「誠信管理獎」，鼓勵建造業持續推行誠信管理。在金融及保險業方面，廉署在金融管理局及香港銀行公會的全力支持下推出「銀行業誠信約章」，鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。

此外，廉署一直決心維護廉潔選舉，在完善選舉制度和地區治理體系後的新選舉安排下，就二○二五年底的立法會選舉及未來各項公共選舉中，廉署會一如既往嚴厲執法，確保選舉能在公平、公開和誠實的情況下進行。

問題：

在本年五月十四日通過的《2024年公司（修訂）（第2號）條例草案》旨在引入公司遷冊機制（該機制），讓境外註冊的企業，無須先在原註冊地進行清盤程序，在保留其法律實體的情況下將註冊地轉移至香港。修訂條例在本年五月二十三日正式生效，該機制並於同日接受申請。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）由本年五月二十三日至六月三十日，當局接獲多少宗境外企業就該機制提出的查詢及申請；該等申請遷冊至香港的境外企業的以下資料：（i）業務性質、（ii）公司資產及規模情況，以及（iii）其原註冊地；

答覆：

主席：

二○二五年五月二十三日，公司遷冊機制開始實施，在香港以外地區成立的公司可向公司註冊處申請遷冊來港。機制可減省複雜昂貴的司法程序，讓經遷冊公司保留其在法律上的法人團體身分，令公司業務得以延續。遷冊申請人須符合公司背景、誠信、對成員及債權人的保障和償付能力等規定。

就問題的四個部分，現綜合回覆如下：

遷冊機制生效後，隨即有兩家國際保險集團宣布計劃遷冊來港，印證機制對企業提升營運效率極具吸引力。截至二○二五年七月十一日，公司註冊處已收到265個有關遷冊的查詢，該處網站專設欄目瀏覽及下載總量已分別超過22 000及42 000次，反映市場對本港新設公司遷冊機制的反應正面。由於有意遷冊來港的公司需時預備申請文件和符合原註冊地及其他相關司法管轄區就擬議遷冊的要求，公司註冊處目前尚未收到境外企業就遷冊來港提交正式申請。與此同時，已有不同金融機構及企業接觸財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）表示正準備申請遷冊來港。就公司註冊處收到的查詢而言，有興趣遷冊的公司大多來自百慕達、開曼群島和英屬維爾京群島等離岸經濟體。

財庫局與公司註冊處以及金融監管機構，會積極為申請公司提供適切支援，協助公司遷冊來港。一般情況下，公司註冊處會在申請人遞交所有所需文件和資料的兩星期內完成審批。申請人獲發遷冊證明書當日，即成為經遷冊公司，並於同日起被視為等同在香港成立為法團的公司。經遷冊公司其後須於120天內在其成立為法團所在地方完成撤銷註冊程序。經遷冊公司可向公司註冊處申請延長該120日的限期，延長期限須受公司註冊處處長認為適當的條件所規限。

公司註冊處已在其網站開設專設欄目，載有公司遷冊指引、申請表格和常見問題。財庫局已聯同公司註冊處及稅務局主動接觸專業組織和商會，以及舉行簡介會介紹公司遷冊機制內容、申請詳情及稅務安排。我們會繼續與投資推廣署、經濟貿易辦事處及香港交易及結算所有限公司合作對外宣傳推廣，吸引在香港以外地區註冊的香港主要上市公司以及其他企業用好公司遷冊機制，發揮機制最大效益，匯聚更多企業、資金和人才，助力本地經濟發展。各項宣傳工作目前分別由財庫局及相關部門以現時人手編制負責。"
LCQ11: Facilitating re-domiciliation of non-Hong Kong-registered enterprises to Hong Kong,2025-07-16 12:30,2025-07-16 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071500640.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Edmund Wong and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 The Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2024, which was passed on May 14 this year, seeks to introduce a company re-domiciliation regime (the Regime) that enables overseas-registered enterprises to transfer their domicile to Hong Kong without having to undergo winding-up procedures in their original domicile while preserving their legal identities. The Amendment Ordinance took effect on May 23 this year, and the Regime opened for applications on the same day. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of enquiries and applications received by the authorities from overseas enterprises regarding the Regime between May 23 and June 30 this year; the following information on such overseas enterprises applying for re-domiciliation to Hong Kong: (i) nature of business, (ii) company assets and scale, and (iii) original domicile;

(2) whether it has estimated the average processing time from receipt of an application for re-domiciliation from an overseas enterprise to formal approval of the enterprise to establish a presence in Hong Kong (i.e. the successful transfer of its domicile to Hong Kong);

(3) whether any overseas enterprises have successfully established a presence in Hong Kong through the Regime to date; if so, of the number of such enterprises, the nature of their business, their company assets and scale, as well as their original domicile; and

(4) whether it will formulate a promotional plan to promote the Regime through Invest Hong Kong and overseas economic and trade offices to attract more overseas enterprises to apply for re-domiciliation to Hong Kong; if so, of the details of the plan (including the resources involved); if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The company re-domiciliation regime commenced on May 23, 2025. A company incorporated outside Hong Kong may apply to the Companies Registry (CR) for re-domiciliation to Hong Kong. The regime reduces the need to go through complicated and costly judicial procedures, and enables a re-domiciled company to maintain its legal identity as a body corporate, thereby ensuring business continuity. An applicant for company re-domiciliation is required to fulfil requirements concerning company background, integrity, member and creditor protection, solvency, etc.

 My consolidated reply to the four parts of the question is as follows:

 After the implementation of the re-domiciliation regime, two international insurance groups immediately announced their plans to re-domicile to Hong Kong, which is the best testament to the regime's effectiveness in enhancing companies' operational efficiency. As at July 11, 2025, the CR received 265 enquiries relating to re-domiciliation. The total number of visits and downloads at the thematic section of the CR's website exceeded 22 000 and 42 000 respectively, reflecting the positive market response to the new company re-domiciliation regime in Hong Kong. As it takes time for companies planning to re-domicile to Hong Kong to prepare the application documents, and to fulfil the requirements of their place of incorporation and other relevant jurisdictions for the proposed re-domiciliation, the CR has not yet received any formal application for re-domiciliation to Hong Kong from non-Hong Kong enterprises. At the same time, some financial institutions and enterprises have contacted the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and expressed that they are preparing to apply for re-domiciliation to Hong Kong. According to the enquiries received by the CR, most of the companies interested in re-domiciliation are from offshore economies such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands.

 The FSTB, the CR and financial regulators will actively provide appropriate support to applicants to assist with their re-domiciliation. Under normal circumstances, the CR will complete the approval process within two weeks after an applicant has submitted all the required documents and information. On the day of issuance of a certificate of re-domiciliation, the applicant becomes a re-domiciled company and is regarded as a Hong Kong-incorporated company from the same date. The re-domiciled company is then required to complete the deregistration procedures at its place of incorporation within 120 days. The re-domiciled company may make an application to the CR to extend the 120-day period subject to any conditions the Registrar of Companies considers appropriate.

 The CR has set up a thematic section on its website, containing the Guide on Company Re-domiciliation, application form and frequently asked questions. The FSTB, in conjunction with the CR and the Inland Revenue Department, has proactively reached out to professional organisations and chambers of commerce, and organised briefings to introduce the content, application details and taxation arrangements of the company re-domiciliation regime. We will continue to work with Invest Hong Kong, the Economic and Trade Offices and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited to conduct external publicity and promotion with a view to attracting major Hong Kong-listed companies and other companies registered outside Hong Kong to make good use of the company re-domiciliation regime, and to maximising the regime's benefits of attracting more companies, capital and talents to Hong Kong, thereby contributing to the development of the local economy. The publicity work is currently undertaken by the FSTB and the relevant departments respectively with their existing staff establishment."

問題：

有意見認為近月本港多間戲院相繼結業，業界面對經營成本上升、串流平台競爭等挑戰，戲院結業潮恐會持續蔓延。另一方面，戲院作為電影的重要展示平台，以及市民消費及文娛的重要場所，行業的長遠發展亟待政府支援。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計過去五年每年戲院結業及開業的數目分別為何；

（二）有否統計目前全港18區各區戲院的以下資料：（i）戲院數目、（ii）可提供座位數目、（iii）每千名人口可享用的座位數目、（iv）銀幕數目，以及（v）平均票價；該等數據與五年前的數據的比較為何；

（三）針對「零／少戲院」的地區，政府會否參考早年做法，在個別出售土地的賣地條件中，加入設立電影院的規定，並訂明不得在營運電影院的首七年內更改電影院作其他用途；有否制訂措施增加戲院的供應；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）由文創產業發展處贊助並自二○二三年起舉辦的全港戲院日的以下資料：每年的（i）參與戲院數目、（ii）放映場次、（iii）‍入場觀眾人次、（iv）票房收入，以及（v）政府的資助金額；有否評估全港戲院日對支援戲院行業發展的成效；當局有否其他進一步措施支援戲院行業？

答覆：

主席：

就陳沛良議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）截至二○二五年七月十日，全港共有52家電影院，較二○二○年（即五年前）減少九家（15%）。雖然近年結業的電影院數目有所增加，但亦有不同營運商先後接手經營。過去五年電影院結業及開業的數目以及平均票價詳見附件一。

目前，全港18區除黃大仙區外均有電影院。至於黃大仙區內早前結業的電影院已獲新營運商接手經營，將於七月中開業。二○二○年及二○二五年全港各區電影院、銀幕、座位及每千人口座位數目的比較載於附件二。

（三）過去兩年電影院面對多方面的挑戰，包括串流平台的興起、環球影業的不景氣、欠缺具市場號召力的電影、電影院租金和運作成本高昂、觀眾觀影和消費習慣的轉變等。此外，本港的電影市場和環球電影市場一樣，都在適應疫情過後所帶來的各種轉變與挑戰。儘管過去兩年有不少電影院結業，我們亦見到新電影院開業，把握商機。政府會繼續密切留意電影院業的困難和需要，並與業界保持緊密溝通。事實上，政府推行的「全港戲院日」（戲院日）和「10.1半價睇好戲」（半價睇好戲）正是針對電影院業的支援措施。此外，政府對電影業提供不同層面及性質的支援，包括人才培訓、推行多項電影製作支援計劃等等，亦令電影院業受惠。然而，電影院的供應及營運應由市場主導，政府現階段沒有計劃在土地拍賣時加入要求設立電影院的規定。

（四）戲院日和半價睇好戲為香港電影市道注入活力和信心，效果顯著。透過提供票價優惠，戲院日及半價睇好戲廣泛地向全港市民推廣電影文化，讓市民以相宜價格一家大小或與朋友到電影院享受觀影樂趣，培養他們到電影院欣賞電影的習慣，長遠拓展觀眾群，對電影業帶來裨益。政府及香港戲院商會都認為活動成效顯著，市民入場人次較同期大幅增加，並多次打破過往同期的入場人次和票房紀錄，為電影院業新增客源；而中小型或非主流電影都在活動中獲得更多觀眾的關注。此外，近期在票價優惠活動當日，有不少戲院的周邊食肆及商店也提供優惠，在進一步刺激觀眾進入電影院觀賞電影之餘，亦帶動周邊消費，讓電影院、電影業界，以致商戶及市民等多方受惠。戲院日和半價睇好戲自二○二三年推出後的參與戲院數目、放映場次、觀影人次、票房收入及基金資助額詳見附件三。

戲院日和半價睇好戲兩個票價優惠活動得到社會和電影市場的非常正面評價。政府會繼續透過文創產業發展處及電影發展基金支持香港電影提質、提量，從源頭出發，支持香港電影製作，期望以優質的香港電影為市場注入信心和活力。與此同時，政府將繼續透過資助不同項目及活動拓展本地觀眾群，培養市民到電影院觀賞電影的習慣，務求協助香港電影業、電影院業穩健發展。"
LCQ14: Supporting cinema industry,2025-07-16 12:25,2025-07-16 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600317.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Pui-leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

There are views that a number of cinemas in Hong Kong have closed down one after another in recent months and the industry is facing challenges such as rising operational costs and competition from streaming platforms, raising concerns that the wave of cinema closures may continue to spread. On the other hand, as cinemas serve as both an important platform for film exhibition and an important outlet for public consumption, culture and entertainment, the industry's long-term development is in dire need of government support. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of cinema closures and new openings in each of the past five years;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the following information of the cinemas in each of the 18 districts across the territory at present: (i)‍ ‍the number of cinemas, (ii) ‍the seating capacity, (iii) ‍the number of seats per 1 000 population, (iv) ‍the number of screens, and (v) ‍the average ticket price; and how such figures compare with those from five years ago;

(3) as regards districts with ""zero/few cinemas"", whether the Government will, by making reference to past practices, consider including a cinema requirement in the land lease of individual land sale sites, stipulating that the cinema shall not be converted to other uses within the first seven years of operation; whether it has formulated measures to increase cinema supply; if it has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) of the following information on the Cinema Day, which has been sponsored by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and held since 2023: the annual (i) ‍number of participating cinemas, (ii) ‍number of screenings, (iii) ‍attendance, (iv)‍‍ ‍box-office takings, and (v)‍ ‍amount of government funding; whether it has assessed the effectiveness of the Cinema Day in supporting the development of the cinema industry; whether the authorities have other measures in place to further support the cinema industry?

Reply:

President,

Regarding the questions raised by the Hon Chan Pui-leung, my reply is as follows:

(1) and (2) As at July 10, 2025, there are 52 cinemas in Hong Kong, representing a decrease of nine cinemas (15 per cent) as compared to 2020 (five years ago). Although the number of cinema closures has increased in recent years, various operators have taken over some of the closed cinemas. The number of cinemas opened and closed, and the average ticket price over the past five years are set out in Annex 1.

Currently, there are cinemas in all the 18 districts except for Wong Tai Sin. The cinema closed earlier in Wong Tai Sin has been taken over by a new operator, and will be reopened in mid-July. A comparison of the number of cinemas, screens, seats and seats per 1000 population across all districts in Hong Kong in 2020 and 2025 is set out in Annex 2.

(3) Over the past two years, cinema industry has been encountering various challenges, including the rise of streaming platforms, downturn in global film industry, lack of blockbusters with strong appeal, high cinema rental and operational costs, and changes in audience viewing and consumption habits. In addition, both the Hong Kong and global film markets are still adapting to various post-pandemic changes and challenges. Despite the closure of some cinemas over the past two years, we have also seen new cinemas opening and seizing business opportunities. The Government will continue to closely monitor the difficulties and needs of the industry and maintain close communication with the trade. In fact, Cinema Day and 1st October Movie Fiesta: Half-Price Spectacular 2024 (1st October Movie Fiesta) launched by the Government aimed at supporting the cinema industry. Moreover, the Government has provided a range of support of different nature and levels, including nurturing talents and implementing multiple film production support schemes, which will also bring benefits to the cinema industry. However, the provision and operation of cinemas should be market-driven. At present, the Government has no plan to incorporate requirement for provision of cinema in the land sale condition of government land leases.

(4) Cinema Day and 1st October Movie Fiesta have brought confidence and impetus into Hong Kong's film market. By offering concessionary ticket prices, both initiatives promote film culture to the public, allowing families and friends to enjoy movies in cinemas at affordable prices, thereby cultivating the habit of cinema-going and building audience, which in turn benefits the film industry in the long term. Both the Government and the Hong Kong Theatres Association consider the events effective in bringing new audience to cinemas, with attendance figures significantly increased compared to the same period in previous years and breaking records in attendance and box office receipts. In addition, medium-to-small-scale and niche films have received more attention during the events. Furthermore, restaurants and shops near cinemas offered discounts at the day of the events, providing additional incentive of watching movies at cinemas and boosting consumption in surrounding shops. Overall speaking, Cinema Day and 1st October Movie Fiesta benefit the cinemas, film industry, businesses, and the general public. The number of participating cinemas, screenings, attendance, box office receipts, and amount of government funding of both initiatives are set out in Annex 3.

Both Cinema Day and 1st October Movie Fiesta have received positive feedbacks from the public and the film market. The Government will continue to support Hong Kong film industry by enhancing both quality and quantity of Hong Kong films through the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency and the Film Development Fund, with a view to bringing confidence and impetus into the market through quality Hong Kong films. Meanwhile, the Government will also continue to fund projects and activities that build local audience, to cultivate the habit of cinema-going and support the steady development of Hong Kong films and cinema industries."

政府去年於沙田沙角街與逸泰街交界及尖沙咀加拿分道與加連威老道交界兩個十字路口試行對角行人過路處。有將軍澳居民反映，將軍澳唐俊街與寶邑路交界十字路口（將軍澳十字路口）在不同時段的人流量極高，因此希望能在該十字路口試行及落實對角行人過路處，以便利當區居民往返港鐵將軍澳站。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否評估沙田及尖沙咀兩個對角行人過路處試點的成效並擬備報告；如有，報告的內容為何；如否，何時會進行有關評估；

（二）會否把將軍澳十字路口納入為對角行人過路處的新試點；如會，將於何時試行；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為將軍澳十字路口每邊有五至六條行車道，對角線距離長達40至50米，但交通燈循環時間與其他十字路口相若，令行人沒有足夠時間以對角方式完成過路，政府會否考慮重新調節該十字路口的交通燈號時間，以便試行對角行人過路處？

答覆：

主席：

對角行人過路處是運輸署推出的行人友善措施之一，在合適的路口讓行人可以選擇以較短距離橫過至路口的對角位置，從而節省步行時間並改善行人環境。就梁子穎議員的提問，經諮詢運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）運輸署分別於去年上半年及下半年開始在沙田沙角街與逸泰街交界路口及尖沙咀加拿分道與加連威老道交界路口設立對角行人過路處作為試點，以測試及評估道路使用者使用有關路口的情況、過路處的安全性及其詳細設計安排，從而協助制定一套適用於香港的對角行人過路處設計標準及指引。據運輸署觀察所得，試驗計劃至今成效正面，行人橫過至路口對角所需時間減少，有關路口整體運作安全暢順。

（二）及（三）運輸署在評估個別路口是否適合加設對角行人過路處時，須照顧不同道路使用者的需要，並審慎考慮個別路口的交通特性（包括車流、人流、路口布局等因素），小心檢視路口的車輛通行能力及對附近一帶交通的影響，並探討不同的工程方案，以確立其可行性。就將軍澳唐俊街與寶邑路交界十字路口而言，由於該路口的對角距離較長，車流亦較為繁忙，增設對角行人過路處須於燈號運作上作較大的調整（如減少行車綠燈時間），方能讓行人有足夠時間安全完成對角過路的安排，這或會影響該路口及附近一帶交通。

為爭取進一步推展對角行人過路處，除上述兩個正在測試的路口試點之外，運輸署正積極評估在其他燈控路口加設對角行人過路處的可行性，當中包括社會各界和立法會／區議會議員在試驗計劃期間建議加設對角過路處的地點。運輸署預計可於今年下半年完成有關的評估，用以揀選新一批的合適路口。其後，運輸署會根據評估結果，審視選址的實地情況及工程規模，以便逐步規劃及開展相關的工程。"
LCQ7: Diagonal crossings,2025-07-16 12:05,2025-07-16 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600345.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

Last year, the Government conducted trials of diagonal crossings at the two crossroads at the junction of Sha Kok Street and Yat Tai Street in Sha Tin and the junction of Carnarvon Road and Granville Road in Tsim Sha Tsui. Some Tseung Kwan O residents have relayed that as the pedestrian flows at the crossroads at the junction of Tong Chun Street and Po Yap Road in Tseung Kwan O (the Tseung Kwan O crossroads) during different periods are extremely high, they hope that diagonal crossings can be tried out and implemented at that crossroads, so as to facilitate the travelling of local residents to and from MTR Tseung Kwan O Station. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has assessed and prepared a report on the effectiveness of the two trials of diagonal crossings in Sha Tin and Tsim Sha Tsui; if so, of the contents of the report; if not, when it will conduct such an assessment;

(2) whether it will include the Tseung Kwan O crossroads as a new trial location for diagonal crossings; if so, when the trial will be conducted; if not, of the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that while the Tseung Kwan O crossroads has five to six carriageways on each side with a diagonal distance of as long as 40 to 50 metres, its traffic signal cycle time is similar to that of other crossroads, leaving insufficient time for pedestrians to cross the road diagonally, whether the Government will consider readjusting the traffic signal timings at that crossroads, so as to facilitate a trial of diagonal crossings?

Reply:

President,

Diagonal crossing is one of the pedestrian-friendly crossing facilities introduced by the Transport Department (TD). Such facilities at appropriate junctions give pedestrians the choice to cross directly to a diagonal corner with shorter walking distance and time, thereby improving the walking environment. After consulting the TD, my consolidated response to the questions raised by the Hon Dennis Leung is as follows:

(1) To assess how road users navigate junctions and to evaluate the safety and detailed design of diagonal crossings, the TD has conducted trials at the junction of Sha Kok Street and Yat Tai Street in Sha Tin in the first half of 2024 and the junction of Carnarvon Road and Granville Road in Tsim Sha Tsui in the second half of 2024, which will help inform the development of design standards and guidelines for diagonal crossings that are appropriate for Hong Kong. As observed by the TD, the trial results have been positive so far. The trial junctions have been operating safely and smoothly, and reduced walking time for pedestrian crossing the junction diagonally.

(2)and (3) In assessing the suitability of diagonal crossing implementation at individual junctions, the TD has to address the needs of different road users, as well as carefully consider the traffic characteristics (including factors such as traffic flow, pedestrian flow and junction layout, etc.) of individual junctions, examine the vehicular capacity of the junctions and its impact on nearby traffic, and explore different engineering options to establish the feasibility. As regards the cross junction of Tong Chun Street and Po Yap Road in Tseung Kwan O, given the relatively long crossing distance and busy traffic flow of the junction, the implementation of diagonal crossing will require significant adjustments to traffic signal (such as reduction of traffic green time) so as to allow sufficient time for pedestrians to cross the road diagonally in a safe manner and this may affect the traffic at the junction and its vicinity.

In addition to the two trial junctions mentioned above, the TD is actively assessing the feasibility of diagonal crossing implementation at other signalised junctions, including locations suggested by the public and Legislative Council/District Council Members during the trial period, in order to further promote diagonal crossings. The TD anticipates that the assessment would be completed in the second half of this year with a view to selecting a new batch of suitable junctions for implementation. Thereafter, the TD will progressively plan and take forward the associated works in the light of the assessment results, the specific conditions of the sites and the complexity of the works involved."
立法會八題：鼓勵生育的措施,2025-07-16 12:00,2025-07-16 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600261.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上尚海龍議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據報近年香港生育率持續低迷，二○二三年的總和生育率僅0.8，遠低於維持人口水平所需的2.1，對香港未來經濟發展、公共服務需求及勞動力結構構成深遠挑戰；而聯合國人口基金會發表的最新報告指出，全球生育率下降的主因為「生育自主權」不足，包括經濟壓力、性別不平等、缺乏伴侶支持及欠缺完善的生育健康服務等結構性障礙。有意見認為現時本港鼓勵生育的政策多聚焦提供短期經濟誘因（例如提供津貼和增加產假），卻未有針對上述結構性障礙制訂長遠策略。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否全面檢視現行鼓勵生育措施的成效，並針對現時市民面對的結構性經濟問題（例如高住屋成本、教育競爭和工作不穩定性）提出具突破性的政策；

（二）鑑於據報有調查指出，僅有兩成二的企業提供多於法例要求的家庭友善措施，當局會否考慮推行「家庭友善職場認證」，透過加強資助企業以提供更多彈性工作安排及育兒支援；

（三）當局會否考慮參考海外及內地的經驗，積極擴展託兒服務網絡，例如研究推出「鄰里託兒券計劃」、資助家長使用社區內合資格的私營託兒服務或善用商業區內的政府閒置用地或社區設施開設更多託兒服務中心；及

（四）當局會否考慮將容許各項人才入境計劃的「高才」、「優才」及「專才」可申請新生嬰兒獎勵金計劃，以鼓勵更多人才留港作出貢獻？

答覆：

主席：

生育議題涉及多個政策範疇及政策局，包括政務司副司長辦公室、勞工及福利局、教育局、民政及青年事務局、財經事務及庫務局、醫‍務衞生局和房屋局。相關政策局及政府部門的綜合回覆如下：

（一）生育是人生重要決定，牽涉不同考慮。生育率並非單靠政府政策可大幅提升。為鼓勵生育，政府不同政策局及部門已採取一系列措施。

在幼兒照顧方面，政府一直資助非政府機構為兒童提供多元化的日間照顧服務，以支援暫時未能照顧子女的家長，包括為零至三歲以下幼兒提供幼兒中心服務、課餘託管服務和「鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃」等。為加強支援在職家庭育兒，由二○二四年起的三年內，社會福利署（社署）會分階段增設共11所資助獨立幼兒中心，服務名額會倍增至共約2000個。社署亦正分階段推展學前兒童課餘託管服務至全港各區，並把「鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃」的服務名額增加至2500個，預計受惠兒童人數會增至25000人。政府亦推行在校課後託管服務計劃，聚焦支援有需要（尤其是來自單親家庭）的小學生在課後留校接受託管及學習支援，從而方便家長外出工作。二○二四／二五學年，超過120間覆蓋全港18區的小學參與計劃，提供約6000個名額。二○二五／二六學年我們會鼓勵更多學校參加計劃，名額不設上限。另一方面，政府不時檢視在職家庭津貼（職津）計劃。自二○二四年四月起，職津計劃劃一增加住戶及兒童津貼金額15%，所有領取職津的家庭均可受惠。職津計劃為育有子女的相關家庭提供額外津貼，增加職津金額有助進一步紓緩基層在職家庭的負擔。以一個育有兩名合資格兒童的四人住戶為例，可領取的職津最高金額已由原本每月4,200元增加至現時每月高達4,830元。

香港教育平等而多元，政府通過公營學校提供12年免費小學及中學教育，確保有足夠公營學位給予合資格在港接受教育的學生，讓他們不論背景，均能接受優質教育，並透過多元支援機制照顧學生個別差異，促進全人發展。這優勢從香港學生在國際研究及評估中的優異表現得到印證。「學生能力國際評估計劃」（PISA）2022的結果顯示，香港在教育平等方面表現突出，在高學術成就的國家或經濟體系中排名第二，反映家庭社經背景，包括父母的職業和教育程度，對香港學生的表現影響極少。這說明了在香港的教育體系下，各學校能給予不同社經背景的學生充足和適切的教育支援服務。有關結果確認香港教育制度的優越性，能為所有學生提供優質和平等的教育機會，促進社會流動。另外，政府自二○一七／一八學年起實施幼稚園教育計劃，目標是提供易於負擔的優質幼稚園教育，以及提高學童按其所需接受不同模式幼稚園教育的機會。現時約九成的半日制幼稚園課程免費，而全日制課程的學費也維持在低水平。有經濟需要的家庭可參與「幼稚園及幼兒中心學費減免計劃」，申請學費減免。現時，透過上述學費減免計劃，家長可獲得全額學費減免。

民政及青年事務局（民青局）一直支援家庭議會（議會）的工作，推動不同的宣傳項目和活動，向市民大眾宣揚關愛家庭的文化。民青局與議會於二○二四年十月推出為期五年的家庭教育推廣計劃（計劃），每年撥款800萬元，資助民間推行非牟利的家庭教育項目，照顧不同家庭的需要。計劃於二○二四至二五年度共批出12‍個項目。另一方面，議會致力在社區推廣更多元化和靈活的家庭友善僱傭措施，這些措施亦有助營造生育友好的環境。自二○二三至二四年度起，議會推出名為「家庭友善在職場」的宣傳短片，介紹本地公司推行的各類家庭友善僱傭措施，並邀請有關僱主及員工分享。短片所介紹的措施包括鼓勵餵哺母乳的安排、讓員工在暑假帶同子女上班、在家工作及彈性工作安排等。議會亦與香港電台合作推出電台節目，向聽眾宣傳不同類型的家庭友善僱傭措施。議會將繼續有關推廣工作。

在稅務措施方面，由二○二三／二四課稅年度起，子女基本免稅額及子女於出生課稅年度的額外免稅額已提高至13‍萬元。此外，由二○二四／二五課稅年度起，與二○二三年十月二十五日或之後出生的子女同住的納稅人如符合指明條件，居所貸款利息或住宅租金的扣除限額可由10萬元增加至12萬元，為期最多19個課稅年度。這些措施有助減輕納稅人供養子女的負擔。

就醫療服務而言，政府一直致力於支援輔助生育服務及鼓勵健康生育，協助有意生育人士。現時，醫院管理局（醫管局）轄下九間公立醫院設有輔助生育服務，當中瑪麗醫院、威爾斯親王醫院和廣華醫院提供體外受精服務。醫管局由二○二四至二五年度起，正逐步增加體外受精的輔助生育公營資助服務名額，由以往每年1100個逐步增加至二○二八至二九年度每年1800個，同時亦會加強相關專業人員的培訓。相關目標正逐步落實，其中醫管局已按計劃在二○二四至二五年度增設100個資助服務名額，並將在二○二五至二六年度再增加300個名額，以及在往後的三個年度各增加100個名額。此外，醫管局已於今年四月下旬將七種輔助生育藥物納入由藥物名冊內的自費藥物轉為專用藥物，病人在特定的臨床應用下獲處方這七款藥物，只須支付標準費用，減輕病人接受相關輔助生育藥物治療的經濟負擔。除公營輔助生育服務外，為減輕輔助生育服務開支帶來的經濟負擔，政府自二○二四至二五課税年度起在薪俸税和個人入息課税下，設立輔助生育服務開支扣除，以鼓勵有生育困難的夫婦尋求所需的醫療協助。與此同時，衞生署亦將重整母嬰健康及家庭計劃服務，分階段在母嬰健康院為生育年齡婦女新增孕前健康服務，並會檢視及調整現時由非政府機構提供的資助家庭計劃服務範疇，促進健康生育。另外，人類生殖科技管理局計劃在今年內取消供自用的配子和胚胎的法定儲存期限，讓市民因應自身健康及其他情況決定配子及胚胎儲存時間，更好地體現生育自主權。

在房屋方面，香港房屋委員會（房委會）已推出「家有初生優先配屋計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」，為公共租住房屋（公屋）及資助出售單位銷售計劃的家庭申請者提供誘因，以鼓勵生育。在公屋編配方面，房委會已於二○二四年四月一日起實施「家有初生優先配屋計劃」，凡有於二○二三年十月二十五日或以後出生而年滿一歲或以下的初生嬰兒的公屋家庭申請，均可獲縮減一年輪候時間。截至二○二五年六月底，已有約5000宗公屋申請在計劃下獲縮減一年輪候時間，當中約420宗已成功獲安排入住公屋。而在資助出售單位方面，房委會已由「出售居者其屋計劃（居屋）單位2024」（「居屋2024」）起，落實二○二三年《施政報告》公布推出的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」。在「居屋2024」新推售單位中，預留約四成單位作配額（即2900個單位），供參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」和「家有長者優先選樓計劃」的合資格申請者攪珠和優先選樓。凡有嬰兒於二○二三年十月二十五‍日或以後出生的居屋家庭申請者，而其子女在申請截止日期時為三歲或以下，均符合申請資格。在「居屋2024」申請期內，房委會共收到約106000份申請表，其中約50000份屬家庭申請者。當中參加「家有長者優先選樓計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」的申請共有約19000份，佔家庭申請者約四成，其中有約800個申請者已通過「家有初生優先選樓計劃」成功購買單位。未能在「居屋2024」中成功選購單位的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」合資格家庭，只要他們的子女在日後推出的資助出售單位銷售計劃的申請截止日期時為三歲或以下，仍可參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」而獲優先選樓。

（二）勞工處透過宣傳及推廣活動，推動僱主採納以僱員為本的良好人事管理方法及實施家庭友善僱傭措施，包括容許靈活工作安排、照顧員工家庭需要而給予特別假期批准，以及提供員工家庭生活相關的支援等。推行家庭友善僱傭措施讓員工能兼顧照顧家庭的需要，亦有助僱主招聘和挽留人手。考慮到企業的不同情況，以推動及鼓勵的方式讓企業靈活實行家庭友善僱傭措施較為合適。勞工處會繼續經不同途徑進行宣傳推廣，包括舉辦《好僱主約章》活動，推動有關工作。

（三）在託兒服務網絡方面，由二○二四年起的三年內，社署會分階段增設合共11所資助獨立幼兒中心。社署一直持續檢視幼兒中心服務的規劃，並會考慮幼兒照顧服務的整體情況及地區的個別因素，適時採取跟進措施，包括加強服務宣傳、調節設置中心的數目及服務名額分配等，以更適切地回應社區的服務需求。

就幼兒照顧設施規劃，政府已把按人口提供的服務規劃比率納入《香港規劃標準與準則》，為資助獨立幼兒中心在新發展或重建地區的規劃過程中，及早預留所需用地和空間。社署一直與相關政府部門保持密切聯絡，在公共屋邨發展或重建項目和市區重建項目中物色合適的用地，以提供幼兒照顧設施。此外，社署會盡量善用空置政府物業／處所及公共屋邨內的空置非住宅處所等，探討是否適合用作幼兒照顧設施；並會就私人機構開辦幼兒中心的註冊申請提供相關資訊和協助，並鼓勵私營機構為僱員提供幼兒照顧支援。

（四）政府在二○二三年《施政報告》公布，向合資格的父母，就每名於二○二三年十月二十五日起出生的嬰兒給予二萬元的現金獎勵，計劃為期三年。由二○二三年十月二十五日開始，父母在為嬰兒辦理出生登記及申領出世紙時，可同時提交獎勵金的申請。截至二○二五年六月底，政府共接獲49567宗合資格申請，並已向48984名申請人發放獎勵金，總發放金額約為9.79億元。政務司副司長辦公室正就新生嬰兒獎勵金計劃進行檢討，在檢討過程中會考慮社會上曾就計劃所提出的建議，包括應否涵蓋不同人才計劃的家庭。"
LCQ8: Measures to encourage childbirth,2025-07-16 12:00,2025-07-16 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600270.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Shang Hailong and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 It has been reported that Hong Kong's fertility rate has remained persistently low in recent years, with the total fertility rate for 2023 standing at only 0.8, which is significantly below the replacement level of 2.1 required to maintain the population level. This situation presents profound challenges to Hong Kong's future economic development, public service demands and workforce structure. The latest report published by the United Nations Population Fund indicates that the primary cause of the global decline in fertility rates is insufficient ""reproductive autonomy"", which includes structural barriers such as economic pressure, gender inequality, lack of partner support and want of comprehensive reproductive health services. There are views that Hong Kong's current pro-natalist policies largely focus on providing short-term economic incentives (e.g. allowances and increased maternity leave) without formulating long-term strategies to address the aforementioned structural barriers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will conduct a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the existing pro-natalist measures, and propose ground-breaking policies to address the current structural economic issues faced by citizens (such as high housing costs, intense educational competition, and job instability);

(2) given that a survey has reportedly indicated that only 22 per cent of enterprises offer family-friendly measures beyond those required by law, whether the authorities will consider implementing a ""family-friendly workplace certification"" programme, through which enhanced subsidies would be provided to enterprises to offer more flexible working arrangements and childrearing support;

(3)whether the authorities will consider drawing on overseas and the Mainland experiences to actively expand the childcare service network, such as by exploring the introduction of a ""neighbourhood childcare voucher scheme"", subsidising parents to use qualified private childcare services within their communities, or making better use of idle government sites or community facilities in commercial areas to establish more childcare service centres; and

(4) whether the authorities will consider allowing ""top talent"", ""quality migrants"" and ""professionals"" admitted under various talent admission schemes to apply for the Newborn Baby Bonus scheme, with a view to encouraging more talent to stay in Hong Kong and contribute to its development?

Reply:

President,

  The issue of childbearing straddles across a number of policy areas and bureaux, including the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration's Office, the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Health Bureau and the Housing Bureau. A consolidated reply by relevant government bureaux and departments is as follows:

(1)Childbearing is a major life decision which involves different considerations. Fertility cannot be boosted substantially by Government's policies alone. Various government bureaux and departments have adopted a range of measures to encourage fertility.

  In respect of child care, the Government has been supporting parents who cannot take care of their children temporarily through subsidising NGOs to provide a variety of day child care services, including Child Care Centre (CCC) services for children aged from birth to under three, After School Care Programme and Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project (NSCCP). To strengthen support for working families in childbearing, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) is setting up 11 aided standalone CCCs in phases over the three years starting from 2024, doubling the total number of service places to reach around 2000. The SWD is also extending the After School Care Programme for pre-primary children to cover all districts in phases, and increasing the number of service places under the NSCCP to 2500 with the estimated number of beneficiaries increasing to 25000. The Government has also launched the School-based After School Care Service Scheme to provide focused support for students in need (particularly those from single-parent families) to stay in school after school hours for care and learning support, thereby allowing their parents to take up jobs. Over 120 primary schools covering 18 districts across the territory participated in the scheme in the 2024/25 school year, providing about 6 000 places. We will encourage more schools to participate in the scheme in the 2025/26 school year without imposing any quota. Meanwhile, the Government reviews the Working Family Allowance (WFA) Scheme from time to time. The rates of the household and child allowances under the WFA Scheme have been increased by 15 per cent across the board with effect from April 2024, benefiting all households receiving the WFA. The WFA Scheme provides additional allowances for relevant childbearing families, and increasing the rates of the WFA helps further alleviate the burden of grassroots working families. Taking a four-person household with two eligible children as an example, the maximum monthly WFA they may receive have increased from the original amount of $4,200 to $4,830 at present.

Hong Kong's education system values equity and diversity. The government provides 12 years' free primary and secondary education through public sector schools, and ensures the provision of sufficient public sector school places for students eligible for receiving education in Hong Kong. Regardless of students' backgrounds, all are given access to quality education. Diversified support mechanisms are in place to cater to individual differences and promote whole-person development. Our competitive edge is clearly reflected in the excellent performance of Hong Kong students in international studies and assessments. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022 results underscore Hong Kong's outstanding performance in educational equity. Hong Kong ranked second among countries or economies with high academic achievements, indicating that the family socio-economic status of Hong Kong students, including occupation and education level of their parents, had minimal bearing on their performance. This demonstrates that, under our education system, schools are able to provide ample and appropriate education support services for students with different socio-economic backgrounds. The results reaffirmed the merits of the Hong Kong education system in providing all students with quality and equal education opportunities, thereby facilitating social mobility. Besides, the Government has launched the Kindergarten Education Scheme since the 2017/18 school year with the objectives of providing good quality and highly affordable kindergarten education, and enhancing the accessibility of students to different modes of services that suit their specific needs. About 90 per cent of half-day kindergartens are currently free of charge, while the school fees for whole-day kindergartens are maintained at a low level. Families with financial needs may apply for fee remission under the Kindergarten and Child Care Centre Fee Remission Scheme (KCFRS). At present, parents can receive full level of fee remission under the KCFRS.

  The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) has been supporting the work of the Family Council (the Council) in promoting a culture of loving families to the general public through organising different publicity programmes and activities. In October 2024, the HYAB and the Council launched the five-year Funding Scheme on the Promotion of Family Education (the Scheme). With annual funding of $8 million, the Scheme subsidises non-profit-making community projects in promoting family education to meet the needs of different families. For the 2024-25 round of applications, a total of 12 projects have been approved. On the other hand, the Council has been encouraging the wider adoption of more diversified and flexible family-friendly employment practices (FFEPs) in the community. These measures will also help promote a childbearing-friendly environment. Since 2023-24, the Council has been launching promotional videos entitled ""Family-friendly Workplace"" featuring various FFEPs adopted by local companies with sharings by employers and employees. The FFEPs presented include breastfeeding-friendly arrangements, allowing employees to bring their children to work during summer vacation, work-from-home arrangement and flexible work hours, etc. The Council has also collaborated with the Radio Television Hong Kong to produce radio programmes to promulgate different FFEPs. The Council will continue the relevant promotion work.

  In terms of tax measures, the basic child allowance and the additional child allowance for each child born during the year of assessment (YA) have been raised to $130,000 starting from YA 2023/24. Moreover, starting from YA 2024/25, for taxpayers who live with their children born on or after October 25, 2023, and meet the prescribed conditions, the deduction ceiling for home loan interest or domestic rents may be raised from $100,000 to $120,000 for a maximum of 19 YAs. These measures help alleviate the financial burden of taxpayers from raising children.

  As regards healthcare services, the Government has been committed to supporting assisted reproductive (AR) services and promoting healthy fertility, to assist those who wish to have children. Currently, nine public hospitals under the Hospital Authority (HA) offer assisted reproductive services, among which Queen Mary Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital, and Kwong Wah Hospital provide in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) services. The HA is gradually increasing the publicly subsidised service quotas of assisted reproductive services for IVF treatment starting from 2024-25, from the previous 1100 per year to 1800 per year in 2028-29, and in parallel enhancing the training for relevant professionals. Achievement of the relevant target is underway, where the HA provided 100 additional subsidised service quotas in 2024-25 as planned, and 300 more quotas will be in place in 2025-26, followed by an additional service quota of 100 places per year in the three years that follow. In addition, the HA repositioned seven AR drugs from self-financed items to special drugs in the HA Drug Formulary in late April this year, whereby patients are only required to pay standard fees if prescribed these seven drugs under specified clinical applications, reducing the financial burden on patients receiving the relevant AR drug therapies. Aside from public AR services, starting from the year of assessment 2024-25, the Government is providing tax deductions for expenses on AR services under salaries tax and personal assessment, to relieve the financial burden from the relevant expenditure and encourage couples faced with fertility difficulties to seek medical assistance as necessary. In the meantime, the Department of Health will also revamp maternal and child health and family planning services, providing new pre-pregnancy health services to reproductive age group women at the Maternal and Child Health Centres in phases, as well as review and adjust the scope of the subsidised family planning service currently provided by non-government organisations, to promote healthy fertility. Furthermore, the Council on Human Reproductive Technology plans to lift the statutory maximum storage periods of gametes and embryos for own use within this year, to allow the members of the public to make their own decisions on the storage duration of gametes and embryos depending on their health and other conditions, so as to better realise reproductive autonomy.

  In respect of housing, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has implemented the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme and the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme to encourage childbearing by giving incentives to family applicants of public rental housing (PRH) and subsidised sale flats (SSF) sale exercises. Regarding the allocation of PRH, the HA has implemented the Families with Newborns Allocation Priority Scheme since April 1, 2024. PRH family applications with babies born on or after October 25, 2023, and aged one or below are credited one year of waiting time. As at end-June 2025, about 5000 PRH applications have been credited one year of waiting time under the scheme, of which about 420 families have already been successfully housed to PRH. As for SSF, starting from the Sale of Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) Flats 2024 (HOS 2024), the HA has implemented the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme which was announced in the 2023 Policy Address. A quota of about 40 per cent of the new flats for sale (i.e. 2900 flats) under HOS2024 were set aside for eligible applicants under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme and the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members for balloting and priority flat selection. Family applicants of HOS with babies born or after October 25, 2023, are eligible if their children are aged three or below on the closing day of the application. During the application period of HOS 2024, the HA received a total of around 106000 applications. Among them, around 50000 were family applicants, of which around 19000 (i.e. about 40 per cent) applied under the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members and Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme. Among these 19 000 applicants, 800 applicants have successfully purchased flats through the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme. If eligible families applying under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme fail to purchase a flat under HOS 2024, they may still apply under the Scheme for priority flat selection as long as their children are aged three or below on the closing day of the application in subsequent SSF sale exercises.

(2)Through publicity and promotional activities, the Labour Department (LD) motivates employers to adopt employee-oriented good human resources management measures and implement family-friendly employment practices, including allowing flexible work arrangements, granting special leave approval to cater for family needs of employees and providing relevant support to employees' family life, etc. Implementing FFEPs enables employees to balance the needs of taking care of their family, and also helps employers recruit and retain staff. Considering the diverse circumstances of enterprises, it is more appropriate to adopt an approach that motivates and encourages enterprises to flexibly implement FFEPs. The LD will continue to take forward relevant work by launching publicity and promotion through various channels, including organising activities on the Good Employer Charter.

(3)As regards the network of child care services, the SWD is setting up 11 aided standalone CCCs in phases over the three years starting from 2024. The SWD has been continuously reviewing the service planning for CCCs and would consider the overall situations of child care services and the characteristics of individual districts so as to take follow-up measures in a timely manner, including enhancing service promotion, and adjusting the planned provision of CCCs and the distribution of service places, etc., to better meet the service demand of the community.

  Regarding the planning for child care facilities, the Government has incorporated the population-based planning ratios into the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines in respect of aided standalone CCCs, with a view to reserving necessary sites and space for these facilities early in the planning process of new and redeveloped areas. The SWD has been maintaining close contact with relevant departments to identify suitable sites in various development or redevelopment of public housing estates and urban renewal projects for the provision of child care facilities. In addition, the SWD will make the best use of vacant government accommodation/premises and vacant non-domestic premises in public housing estates to explore whether they are suitable for the use of child care facilities. The SWD will also provide relevant information and assistance to private organisations applying for registration to operate CCCs, and encourage private organisations to provide child care support for their employees.

(4)The Government announced in the 2023 Policy Address that a cash reward of $20,000 will be provided to eligible parents for each baby born from October 25, 2023, for a period of three years. Starting from October 25, 2023, parents can submit an application for the bonus at the same time when registering the birth of their baby and applying for a birth certificate. As of end-June 2025, a total of 49 567 qualified applications have been received, and the bonus has been distributed to 48984 applicants, at a total amount of approximately $979 million. The Office of the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration is carrying out a review of the Newborn Baby Bonus Scheme. In the review, suggestions which have been raised in the community, including whether to cover families under different talent schemes, will be considered."

問題：

勞工處就業資訊及推廣計劃辦事處（該辦事處）負責推廣就業服務，通過提供就業資訊協助求職人士尋找工作，並幫助僱主招聘合適員工。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）該辦事處現行的人手編制詳情（包括職位數目、職級分布及全職與合約制員工比例）為何；二○二二年至二○二四‍年期間，（i）該辦事處的運作開支、（ii）舉辦的招聘會場數，以及（iii）處理的職位空缺數目為何，並按年份及行業類別（例如零售、建造業、服務業等）列出分項資料；

（二）二○二二年至二○二四年期間，經該辦事處轉介並成功獲聘的就業個案（成功配對個案）的數目及其佔該辦事處所處理的職位空缺數目的百分比為何，並按求職者的年齡、性別、學歷和群體（例如少數族裔或殘疾人士），以及獲聘職位的行業分類列出；有否就成功配對個案訂定清晰的定義及準則（例如須持續受僱三個月或以上）；

（三）勞工處有否為該辦事處的工作制訂績效指標，例如招聘會參與率、職位空缺填補率或求職者滿意度；若有，詳情（包括主要指標，以及在二○二二年至二○二四年期間該等指標的達標情況）為何；若否，原因為何；

（四）有否計劃全面檢討該辦事處的服務成效，以優化支援弱勢勞工（包括低技術工人、婦女、少數族裔、中年人士等）就業的措施；若有，詳情（包括檢討的時間表、範圍及目標）；若否，原因為何，以及會否進行相關檢討；

答覆：

主席：

勞工處為求職人士提供多元化及免費的就業服務，鼓勵及協助他們投入就業市場。勞工處就業資訊及推廣科轄下的就業資訊及推廣計劃辦事處（辦事處）負責舉辦大型招聘會及籌劃宣傳活動，推廣勞工處的就業服務及相關資訊。辦事處亦積極聯繫僱主，搜羅各行業的職位空缺，協助僱主招聘員工，促進就業資訊流通。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五年度，辦事處的人手編制按職系劃分的分項數字載於附件一。同期，辦事處的運作開支（不包括薪酬開支）每年分別為502萬元、907萬元及894萬元。由於2019冠狀病毒病疫情，二○二二年部分活動未能舉辦，因此運作開支較低。

二○二二年至二○二四年，辦事處全年分別舉辦13場、17場及18場大型招聘會，分別提供23 594個、36 870個及32 900個職位空缺，讓求職人士即場向僱主提出職位申請。由於2019冠狀病毒病疫情，二○二二年舉辦大型招聘會的場次及錄得的職位空缺較少。相關職位空缺按行業劃分的分項數字載於附件二。

（二）勞工處舉辦的大型招聘會提供方便的平台，供僱主及求職人士直接會面。求職人士除可即場申請職位及面試外，亦可直接向僱主了解行業的發展、公司文化及職位要求等。同時，求職人士可在招聘會使用勞工處的就業諮詢服務，以及獲取各項就業計劃的資訊。

二○二二年至二○二四年，全年分別約有6 600名、26 500名及32 600名求職人士到訪辦事處舉辦的大型招聘會。由於2019冠狀病毒病疫情，二○二二年到訪大型招聘會的求職人數較低。根據勞工處於招聘會後收回的僱主問卷回覆，二○二二年至二○二四年每年分別約有1 300名、1 900名及2 000名求職人士在招聘會後一個月內獲聘。勞工處沒有備存到訪招聘會及在招聘會後獲聘人士的分項數字。

（三）及（四）勞工處不時在各區舉辦大型招聘會，並在各就業中心舉辦地區性專題招聘會，包括為少數族裔人士舉辦共融招聘會、為中高齡求職人士（包括婦女）舉辦兼職或專題招聘會。

整體而言，僱主、求職人士和相關持份者對招聘會的需求殷切，參與招聘會的僱主及求職人士對招聘會的反應十分良好。由於職位空缺的數目、招聘成功率等受經濟、勞工市場、求職人士個人情況等因素影響，為辦事處或其籌辦的大型招聘會制定「關鍵績效指標」並不合適。

勞工處會繼續密切監察經濟及就業市場的變化，適時檢討各項就業服務的成效，並推出適切的優化措施。

（五）及（六）勞工處的十所就業中心，為求職人士提供綜合的就業服務。求職人士除可使用中心的就業轉介服務外，亦可使用中心的設施，包括空缺搜尋終端機、供撰寫履歷表的文書處理電腦及就業資訊角等。中心的就業主任亦與求職人士會面，提供個人化的就業諮詢服務，並按求職人士的需要和意願，建議他們參加合適的就業計劃，或報讀培訓╱再培訓課程，提升就業能力及增加獲聘機會。所有中心現時均為中高齡人士（包括婦女）及少數族裔人士提供專項服務，例如為50歲或以上人士提供優先就業服務及為少數族裔安排傳譯服務等。

此外，勞工處推行各項就業計劃，包括「展翅青年就業計劃」、「再就業津貼試行計劃」、「中高齡就業計劃」及「多元種族就業計劃」，支援及促進青年、中高齡人士（包括婦女）及少數族裔人士就業。勞工處與相關團體保持協作，包括委聘非政府機構，為參加者提供就業支援等，共同推行就業計劃。

就業中心不但提供綜合服務，同時也與相關團體協作推行就業計劃。這種模式行之有效，可全面及靈活地切合不同類別（包括婦女、長者及少數族裔人士等）求職人士的需要。因此，勞工處目前沒有計劃另行設立其他就業支援平台，或為特定群組新設專用的就業支援中心。"
LCQ18: Employment support services,2025-07-16 11:55,2025-07-16 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600290.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Ngan Man-yu and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

  The Employment Information and Promotion Programme Office (EIPPO) of the Labour Department (LD) is responsible for promoting employment services, assisting job-seekers in finding jobs through the provision of employment information, and helping employers recruit suitable staff. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the details of EIPPO's existing staffing establishment (including the number of posts, rank distribution and the ratio of full-time to contract staff); between 2022 and 2024, (i) the operating expenses of EIPPO, (ii) the number of job fairs organised, and (iii) the number of job vacancies processed, together with a breakdown by year and industry type (e.g. retail, construction and service);

(2) of the number of successful placements referred by the EIPPO (""successful job matching"") between 2022 and 2024 and its percentage in the total number of job vacancies processed by the EIPPO, together with a breakdown by the age, sex, academic qualification and group (e.g. ethnic minorities or persons with disabilities) of job seekers, and the industry of the placement; whether it has laid down clear definitions and criteria for successful job matching (e.g. staying in employment for three months or more);

(3) whether the LD has formulated performance indicators for the EIPPO's work, such as participation rates at job fairs, vacancy filling rates or job seeker satisfaction levels; if so, of the details (including the key indicators and their attainment between 2022 and 2024); if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether it has plans to comprehensively review the effectiveness of the EIPPO's services, so as to enhance the employment support measures for vulnerable workers (including low-skilled workers, women, ethnic minorities and middle-aged persons); if so, of the details (including the timetable, scope and objectives of the review); if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will conduct the relevant review;

(5) whether it will consider strengthening co-operation with enterprises, social organisations and non-governmental organisations to establish an ""employment support platform for vulnerable workers"", and encouraging enterprises to provide internships and long-term employment opportunities suitable for vulnerable workers; if so, of the details (including the content of the plan, the implementation timetable, the measures to provide subsidies or incentives to enterprises, as well as the expected effectiveness); if not, the reasons for that, and whether there are other alternative measures; and

(6) whether it will, by drawing reference from LD's practice of setting up industry-specific job centres (e.g. the Recruitment Centre for the Catering Industry, the Recruitment Centre for the Retail Industry and the Construction Industry Recruitment Centre), convert job centres in some districts into one-stop employment support centres specifically targeting women, the elderly and ethnic minorities, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of such centres?

Reply:

President,

  The Labour Department (LD) provides diversified and free employment services to job-seekers to encourage and assist them in entering the labour market. The Employment Information and Promotion Programme Office (EIPPO) under the Employment Information and Promotion Division of the LD is responsible for holding large-scale job fairs and organising publicity projects to promote the LD's employment services and related information. The EIPPO also actively liaises with employers to canvass job vacancies from different industries with a view to assisting employers in recruiting employees and expediting the dissemination of employment information.

  The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1)The breakdown of the EIPPO's staff establishment by grade from 2022-23 to 2024-25 is at Annex 1. The EIPPO's annual operational expenses (excluding staff cost) during the same period was $5.02 million, $9.07 million and $8.94 million respectively. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some activities could not be organised in 2022, resulting in lower operational expenses for the year.

  From 2022 to 2024, the EIPPO organised 13, 17 and 18 large-scale job fairs each year, offering 23 594, 36 870 and 32 900 job vacancies respectively for job-seekers to submit job applications to employers on the spot. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of large-scale job fairs organised and job vacancies recorded in 2022 were lower. A breakdown of the relevant job vacancies by industry is at Annex 2.

(2)The LD organises large-scale job fairs to provide a convenient platform for employers and job seekers to meet face-to-face. In addition to applying for jobs and attending interviews on the spot, job seekers can learn directly from employers about trade development, company culture, job requirements, etc. At the same time, they can make use of the LD's consultation services during job fairs and obtain information on various employment programmes.

  From 2022 to 2024, about 6 600, 26 500 and 32 600 job seekers attended the large-scale job fairs organised by the EIPPO each year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of job seekers visiting the large-scale job fairs was lower in 2022. Based on the questionnaire responses collected by the LD from employers after the job fairs, from 2022 to 2024, approximately 1 300, 1 900 and 2 000 job seekers were respectively employed within one month after the job fairs each year. The LD does not maintain breakdowns of the job fair visitors or individuals employed after the job fairs.

(3) and (4)The LD from time to time organises large-scale job fairs across the territory and stages district-based thematic job fairs at its job centres, including inclusive job fairs for ethnic minorities, and part-time or thematic job fairs targeting elderly and middle-aged job seekers (including women).

  Overall, employers, job seekers and relevant stakeholders have strong demand for job fairs. Participating employers and job seekers respond very favourably to the events. As the number of job vacancies, success rate of recruitment, etc., may be affected by factors such as the economy, labour market situation and personal circumstances of job seekers, it is inappropriate to set Key Performance Indicators for the EIPPO or the large-scale job fairs it organises.

  The LD will continue to closely monitor changes in the economy and employment market, conduct timely review on the effectiveness of various employment services, and implement appropriate enhancement measures.

(5) and (6)The LD's ten job centres provide integrated employment services to job seekers. Apart from job referral service, job seekers can also use the facilities of the job centres, including vacancy search terminals, computers with word processing function for preparing resume, employment information corners, etc. Employment officers of the centres may also meet with job seekers to provide them with personalised employment advisory service, and based on their needs and preferences, recommend them to join suitable employment programmes or to enroll in training/retraining courses so as to enhance their employability and employment opportunities. All job centres also provide dedicated services for elderly and middle-aged persons (including women), and ethnic minorities, such as priority employment services for those aged 50 or above, and arrangement of interpretation services for ethnic minority job seekers.

  Additionally, the LD implements various employment programmes including Youth Employment and Training Programme, Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme, Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged and Racial Diversity Employment Programme to support and facilitate the employment of young people, elderly and middle-aged persons (including women) as well as ethnic minorities. The LD collaborates with relevant groups, including engaging non-governmental organisations to provide employment support to participants, etc., to jointly implement employment programmes.

  Apart from offering integrated employment services, job centres also collaborate with relevant groups in implementing employment programmes. Proven to be effective, this modus operandi can comprehensively and flexibly meet the needs of different groups of job seekers (including women, older persons and ethnic minorities, etc.). As such, the LD currently has no plan to set up other employment support platform, or new employment support centres for specific groups of job seekers."
立法會九題：智能回收系統先導計劃,2025-07-16 11:42,2025-07-16 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600262.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上盧偉國議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

環境保護署（環保署）從二○二二年年中開始擴展「智能回收系統先導計劃」（先導計劃），並由該年底起在部分「回收環保站」和「回收便利點」開始逐步配備智能回收箱和自動禮品兌換機。智能回收箱亦於二○二三年三月起陸續進駐屋邨、屋苑、鄉村、商場、大學和政府場地等，先導計劃的應用點已由計劃開展初期的四個增加至現時超過800個。此外，智能回收箱可24小時全天候運作，並設有感應器讓回收物收集服務承辦商（承辦商）可監測回收箱的滿溢情況。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有市民反映他們不時發現智能回收箱滿溢，雖有作出投訴但有關方面的跟進緩慢，以致他們往往被迫將回收物品帶回家中，減低其回收意欲，自二○二三年三月至今，環保署每月接獲有關投訴的宗數、完成跟進的宗數，以及處理每宗投訴所需的平均時間分別為何；

（二）當局有否訂立恆常監管機制，對承辦商處理有關智能回收箱滿溢情況的投訴，以至一般服務表現作定期評估和檢討，並要求承辦商在限定時間內作出改善；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）隨着先導計劃的智能回收箱應用點陸續增加，當局會否同時增撥資源以加強巡視和抽查，從而確保整個智能回收系統發揮應有的作用；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

環境保護署（環保署）於二○二○年第四季推出「智能回收系統先導計劃」（先導計劃），分階段測試不同的智能回收設備，包括智能回收箱、智能磅和自動禮物兌換機。截至二○二五年六月底，除在全線「綠在區區」回收設施設置智能磅外，先導計劃在全港不同地點，包括「綠在區區」設施、公共屋邨、私人屋苑、鄉村、商場、大學和政府場地等，試驗設置159套智能回收箱，提供自助回收服務。

就盧偉國議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）各場地設置的智能回收箱一般由有關處所的物業管理（物管）公司或清潔公司負責清理，以及安排回收商到場收集和回收。

智能回收箱配備重量傳感器和容量水平感應器，並設有兩重提示機制，當收集到的回收物接近容量上限八成時，系統會自動向有關場地的工作人員發出訊息。當達至滿載時，系統會再次提醒物管及／或清潔承辦商等以便即時處理，物管公司一般都會定期或在收到訊息後短時間內清理回收物。環保署亦會透過大數據平台進行監察，適時作出跟進，數據顯示智能回收箱因滿載而暫停使用的時間，佔整體運作時間約7%。此外，大多數設置智能回收箱的處所亦同時設有傳統回收桶，讓市民可選擇在智能回收箱滿載時，把回收物放進回收桶。

二○二三年三月至二○二五年六月底，環保署收到有關智能回收箱滿溢的投訴宗數見下表。每次收到投訴後，環保署會即時跟進，要求有關的物管公司或清潔承辦商盡快清空智能回收箱，重啓其功能。環保署會持續監察各場地智能回收箱的運作，按需要與有關處所的物管公司商討，適時調整清理回收物的安排。

LCQ9: Pilot Programme on Smart Recycling Systems,2025-07-16 11:40,2025-07-16 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600268.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has extended the Pilot Programme on Smart Recycling Systems (the Pilot Programme) starting from mid-2022 and gradually installed smart recycling bins and gift redemption units in some Recycling Stations and Recycling Stores since the end of that year. Starting from March 2023, smart recycling bins have also been progressively set up in housing estates, villages, shopping malls, universities, government venues, etc. The number of application points under the Pilot Programme has been increased from four locations in the initial phase to more than 800 locations at present. In addition, smart recycling bins support 24-hour operation and are equipped with sensors to enable recyclables collection service contractors (the contractors) to monitor the overflowing of recycling bins. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that some members of the public have relayed that they find from time to time that the smart recycling bins are overflowing, and despite their complaints, the follow-up actions taken by the authorities concerned have been slow, and they are often forced to take the recyclable items back home and thus reducing their incentives for recycling, of the respective numbers of such complaints received, number of cases with follow-up actions completed and average time taken to handle a complaint by the EPD in each month since March 2023;

(2) whether the authorities have put in place a regular monitoring mechanism to assess and review the contractors' handling of complaints about the overflowing of smart recycling bins as well as their general service performance, and require the contractors to make improvements within a specified period of time; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) with the gradual increase in the number of smart recycling bins application points under the Pilot Programme, whether the authorities will allocate additional resources at the same time to step up inspections and random checks, thereby ensuring that the smart recycling systems can serve their functions; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) launched the Pilot Programme on Smart Recycling Systems (the Pilot Programme) in the fourth quarter of 2020, to test different smart recycling devices in phases, including smart recycling bins, smart balances and gift redemption units. As at end-June 2025, in addition to installing smart balances at all GREEN@COMMUNITY recycling facilities, the Pilot Programme has installed 159 sets of smart recycling bins at different locations across Hong Kong for testing, including GREEN@COMMUNITY facilities, public rental housing estates, private housing estates, villages, shopping malls, universities and government venues, for providing self-service recycling.

 The reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok is as follows:

(1) The property management companies or cleaning companies of the premises concerned are responsible for the clearance of the smart recycling bins set up at respective locations, as well as arranging recyclers for collection and recycling of recyclables.

Smart recycling bins are equipped with weight sensors and fill level sensors, featuring a dual alert mechanism. When the collected recyclables approach 80 per cent of the bin capacity limit, the system will automatically send a message to the relevant site staff of the venue. When a bin reaches its full capacity, the system will remind the property management company and/or cleaning contractor again for immediate action. Property management companies usually clear the collected recyclables regularly or shortly after receiving alert messages. The EPD also monitors the situation through the big data platform for timely follow-up actions. Data shows that the time which smart recycling bins was temporarily suspended due to overfilled bins accounts for about 7 per cent of the overall operating time of smart recycling bins. In addition, most premises with smart recycling bins are equipped with conventional recycling bins at the same time, which allow the public to place recyclables in these bins when the smart recycling bins are full.

From March 2023 to end-June 2025, the number of complaints received by the EPD regarding overfilled smart recycling bins are provided in the table below. Upon receipt of each complaint, the EPD would follow up immediately and request the concerned property management company or cleaning contractor to empty the smart recycling bin and resume its functions as soon as possible. The EPD will continue to monitor the operation of smart recycling bins at all locations, and liaise with the concerned property management companies as needed for timely adjustments to the arrangements for clearance of recyclables.

(2) As mentioned above, smart recycling bins are equipped with weight sensors and fill level sensors, featuring a dual alert mechanism. When the collected recyclables approach 80 per cent of the bin capacity limit, the system will automatically send a message to the relevant site staff of the venue, who should arrange clearance as soon as possible upon receiving the message. We will review the arrangements for clearance of smart recycling bins and explore ways to further enhance clearance efficiency. In addition, we are arranging to test the addition of a compression function in smart recycling bins to enhance the recycling capacity so as to reduce the frequency of clearance required and further reduce the downtime of the bins due to being full, thereby improving the service quality.

(3) The EPD's service contracts require the contractors of smart recycling bins to provide operational monitoring data and arrange staff to conduct regular inspections to ensure proper operation of the devices. The EPD will also continue to monitor the usage of smart recycling bins and conduct inspections and spot checks from time to time to ensure that the contractors' services meet the contract requirements. We will review the contract requirements and strengthen the performance indicators on maintenance services in the new contracts to enhance efficiency. With the increase in the number of application points, the EPD will deploy resources to step up inspections based on the actual situation, so that the entire smart recycling system can operate at its optimal level.

 On the other hand, to further enhance the operation and services of smart recycling devices, the EPD is actively preparing for introducing a new feature on displaying the real-time recycling status of smart recycling bins in the GREEN$ mobile app and the Hong Kong Waste Reduction Website, with a view to facilitating the public to plan for their recycling activities. This new feature is expected to be launched by the end of 2025."
ICAC Complaints Committee annual report tabled in LegCo,2025-07-16 11:35,2025-07-16 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600249.htm,"The 2024 Annual Report of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) Complaints Committee was tabled in the Legislative Council today (July 16). The report gives a summary of the Committee's work in 2024.

The Committee is tasked with the responsibility of monitoring the handling of non-criminal complaints against the ICAC and its officers. The Committee takes an independent view on the ICAC's investigation findings on the complaints received, reviews the ICAC's procedures which may lead to complaints, and makes recommendations for improvement.

In 2024, the Committee received 13 complaints involving 53 allegations against the ICAC or its officers which required full investigations. Among the allegations registered in 2024, 92 per cent were related to neglect of duties by ICAC officers, 6 per cent to misconduct matters and 2 per cent to abuse of power. 

The ICAC submits investigation reports to the Committee after conducting full investigations on complaint cases. During 2024, the Committee considered the investigation reports of 17 complaint cases including 13 cases received in 2024 and four cases received in 2023 for which the related investigation was completed in 2024. These complaints contained a total of 66 allegations in which one allegation involving one ICAC officer was found to be substantiated. In this year, the Committee also considered and endorsed six assessment reports submitted by the ICAC for complaints which did not warrant a full investigation. Preliminary assessments showed that the six cases were irrational complaints or had already been dealt with during the court trial with a decision made, and the Committee agreed that no further investigative actions should be taken.

After a careful examination of the issues identified in the investigation reports considered during 2024, the ICAC has strengthened training programmes for frontline officers to enhance their vigilance and professionalism when discharging their duties.

The annual report of the Committee is available on the Administration Wing's website (www.admwing.gov.hk/eng/links/icac.htm) and also at the ICAC's regional offices."

LCQ16: Mobile applications to assist with travel for persons with disabilities,2025-07-16 11:23,2025-07-16 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600273.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Andrew Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 Regarding mobile applications to assist with travel for persons with disabilities (PWDs), will the Government inform this Council:

(1) which funded projects under the current government funding schemes for software and application development are related to assistance with barrier-free travel for PWDs (set out in a table);

(2) of the Government's plans (e.g. provision of funding support) in place to integrate, enhance and link up existing mobile applications that assist with barrier-free travel for PWDs, so as to optimise the use of resources and enable such applications to more effectively serve PWDs; and

(3) given that since 2020 the Lands Department has been developing a set of 3D Digital Map with functions including provision of barrier-‍free route planning for people with different commuting needs, how the Government promotes the best use of such digital map among the public and private sectors and identifies access points in need of improvement, so as to lay down a foundation for future improvement and update of the relevant software and hardware (e.g. the relevant mobile applications and barrier-free facilities)?

Reply:

President,

 The Government is committed to providing appropriate support and assistance to persons with disabilities in need so as to facilitate their travel and help them fully integrate into the community. Having consulted the relevant bureaux, I set out below a consolidated reply to the Member's question –

(1) Both the Smart Traffic Fund and the Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Fund set up by the Government have provided funding for projects that assist barrier-free travel for persons with disabilities. Information on the relevant projects is at Annexes 1 and 2 respectively.

(2) Regarding the mobile applications developed by the Government, the Digital Policy Office has promulgated the ""Practice Guide for Developing Mobile Apps"", requiring bureaux/departments (B/Ds) to conduct regular reviews after launching mobile applications, and to update and consolidate existing mobile applications in a cost-effective manner.

 For instance, in 2016, the Lands Department (LandsD) launched a mobile application ""VoiceMapHK"", which is specifically designed for the visually impaired, providing audio output that reads out information about nearby locations on the map. The visually impaired can also make use of the voice function of their mobile phones to issue commands, and the application will respond by reading out the corresponding results. To optimise the use of resources, the LandsD plans to integrate the functionalities of the ""VoiceMapHK"" into the GeoInfo Map, another map application under its management. With the launch of the ""iAM Smart"" mini-program platform later this year, all B/Ds must consider to prioritise migrating their mobile applications or integrating the core functions into the ""iAM Smart"" platform, so that members of the public can easily access the required application services without the need to download additional applications, thereby enhancing the consolidation of Government mobile applications.

 In addition, in 2021, the Development Bureau (DEVB), with the support of various non-governmental organisations, the MTR Corporation Limited and some iconic shopping malls in Kowloon East, developed a ""Smart Navigation Tool for The Visually Impaired/People in Need"" Proof-of-Concept, providing barrier-free navigation experience. This tool utilises indoor maps to provide indoor and outdoor seamless navigation, which helps users easily navigate and interact with the environment, and increases their independence and mobility. In January 2023, this tool was incorporated into the ""MyKE"" mobile application as the ""Walking Assistant"" function. The DEVB will continue to explore scaling up this Proof-of-Concept to cover more areas, so as to enable those in need to commute more freely.

 In response to the recommendations of the Equal Opportunities Commission on enhancing the overall accessibility of Hong Kong, the Transport Department has also enhanced the function of accessible route option of the mobile application HKeMobility since April 2024 by expanding the accessible route option from walking mode to public transport mode. When members of the public choose to travel by public transport, the HKeMobility can plan routes with visual aids or mobility aids to enable the public to identify barrier-free accesses (such as locations of lifts, ramps and footbridges) along the way to transport stations, so that persons with disabilities can plan their journeys more efficiently and travel on their own.

 In addition, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has been actively pursuing web accessibility design over the years. The HKO's in-house developed mobile application ""MyObservatory"" has already incorporated guidelines on accessibility features and functions, including screen reader compatibility, alternative texts for images and selectable font size, so as to facilitate all sectors of the community (including persons with disabilities) to browse the ""MyObservatory"" to get the latest weather conditions before traveling. The HKO will continue to incorporate accessibility features and functions in the mobile application, providing enhanced weather services.

(3) The LandsD and the Spatial Data Office (SDO) of the DEVB have been promoting the application of 3D Digital Map to public and private organisations through various channels (such as public talks and workshops), to highlight the development opportunities it brings. As a key component of the 3D Digital Map, the 3D Pedestrian Network provides a wealth of useful information, such as road names, gradient and length of road sections, distribution of en-route obstacles and opening hours of public lifts, as well as wheelchair accessibility data at entrance to government facilities and public lifts. This enables barrier-free route planning for people with different commuting needs. The LandsD and the SDO of the DEVB will continue to engage with various stakeholders (including social welfare organisations and groups serving persons with disabilities), communicate with relevant public and private organisations based on stakeholder needs, promote cross-agency information exchange and collaboration, and jointly optimise the 3D Pedestrian Network to enhance the convenience of public mobility."
立法會十六題：協助殘疾人士出行的流動應用程式,2025-07-16 11:23,2025-07-16 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600269.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上林筱魯議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

關於協助殘疾人士出行的流動應用程式，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時涉及資助軟件及應用程式開發的政府資助計劃中，有哪些獲資助項目與協助殘疾人士無障礙出行相關（以表列出）；

（二）政府有何計劃（例如透過資助），整合、增強及連結現有協助殘疾人士無障礙出行的流動應用程式，以使資源用得其所及令該等應用程式更有效為殘疾人士服務；及

（三）鑑於地政總署自二○二○年起研發三維數碼地圖，當中功能包括為有不同出行需要的人士提供無障礙路線規劃，政府如何推廣公私營機構善用該數碼地圖，並找出未完善的通行地點，以為日後改善及更新有關軟硬件（例如相關流動應用程式及無障礙設施）提供基礎？

答覆：

主席：

政府致力為有需要的殘疾人士提供適切的支援和協助，以利便殘疾人士出行，幫助他們全面融入社會。就議員的提問，經諮詢相關政策局，我綜合答覆如下：

（一）政府設立的智慧交通基金和社會創新及創業發展基金均有為協助殘疾人士無障礙出行的項目提供資助，相關項目資料分別載於附件一及二。

（二）數字政策辦公室就政府開發的流動應用程式已發布《流動應用程式實務指南》，要求各政策局／部門（局／部門）在推出流動應用程式後須作定期檢討，並以具成本效益的方式更新及整合現有的流動應用程式。

舉例說，地政總署於二○一六年推出專為視障人士而設的手機應用程式「香港有聲地圖」，以語音讀出地圖上附近的資訊，視障人士亦可利用手機的語音功能輸入所需指令，應用程式可隨即讀出相關結果。為善用資源，地政總署計劃將「香港有聲地圖」的相關功能整合至該署管理的另一地圖應用程式「地理資訊地圖」內。隨著「智方便」小程序平台於今年內推出，各局／部門亦必須優先考慮將流動應用程式遷移或整合主要功能於「智方便」平台上，令市民可以便捷地使用所需的應用服務，無須額外下載安裝應用程式，以加強政府流動應用程式的整合。

此外，二○二一年發展局在多個非政府機構、港鐵公司及九龍東地標式購物商場的支持下，開發了「為視障人士／有需要人士設計的智慧出行導航工具」概念驗證，提供無障礙導航體驗。該工具利用室內地圖，實現室內外無縫導航，幫助使用者輕鬆瀏覽環境並互動，提高他們的獨立性和移動能力。這項功能於二○二三年一月以「暢行助手」在「我的九龍東」手機應用程式中推出。發展局會繼續探討將此概念擴展至更多地區，讓有需要人士出行時能更自主自在。

運輸署亦於二○二四年四月起，因應平等機會委員會就提升香港整體通達程度的建議，加強流動應用程式「香港出行易」無障礙路線的功能，將無障礙路線選項由步行模式擴展至公共交通工具模式。當市民選擇以公共交通工具出行時，「香港出行易」可規劃視覺輔助路線或行動輔助路線，讓市民掌握前往車站沿途的無障礙通道（例如升降機、斜道、天橋的位置），以便殘疾人士可以更有效規劃行程，自主出行。

此外，香港天文台（天文台）多年來一直積極響應及支持無障礙網頁設計，由天文台內部研發的流動應用程式「我的天文台」亦已採用無障礙網頁設計準則，支援讀屏軟件、圖片說明文字及大小字體選擇等功能，方便各界人士（包括殘疾人士）在出行前瀏覽「我的天文台」，了解最新的天氣情況。天文台會繼續為流動應用程式加入無障礙功能，進一步加強天氣服務。

（三）地政總署及發展局空間數據辦事處一直經由不同渠道（例如講座及工作坊）向公私營機構推廣三維數碼地圖應用，闡釋其帶來的發展機遇。作為三維數碼地圖的重要組成部分，三維行人道路網匯集豐富路徑資訊，例如道路名稱、坡度、長度、沿途障礙物分佈及公共升降機開放時間，並整合政府設施入口的輪椅通行資訊及公共升降機數據，為不同出行需要人士提供無障礙路線規劃。地政總署及發展局空間數據辦事處會持續與各持份者（包括社福機構及服務殘疾人士的組織）溝通，因應持份者的需要聯絡相關公私營機構，促進跨機構資訊交流與協作，共同優化三維行人道路網，提升公共出行的便捷性。"

崔特派員（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署特派員崔建春）、潘副特派員（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員潘雲東）、女士們、先生們：

早上好。歡迎也感謝大家出席由中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署和律政司香港國際法律人才培訓學院首次合作舉辦的「香港青年國際法律人才帶路行」（「帶路行」）的啓動儀式。我很高興今日能跟各位充滿朝氣和活力的青年國際法律人才聚首一堂，在大家出發前跟各位作分享和打氣。

首先，我非常感謝外交部駐港公署精心籌劃今次「帶路行」活動，讓香港的青年國際法律人才有機會到訪北京和喀什，參與這次非常難得的學習交流活動。青年人是國家的未來支柱，青年的國際法律人才更肩負着推動法治建設的重要使命。要成為國家有所擔當的法律專業人士，深入了解國情是必不可少的。只有充分掌握國家的歷史文化、政治體制、經濟及科技的發展方向，才能更好掌握法律制度的設計與運作，並在實踐中有效維護國家安全和社會公平、正義。古人說讀萬卷書不如行萬里路，我認為在今時今日，既要讀萬卷書，更要行萬里路！因此，我非常支持在座的青年國際法律人才參與「帶路行」。

這次「帶路行」的行程豐富，讓大家能夠親身走訪國家兩個極具代表性的城市——首都北京和絲綢之路代表城鎮喀什，實屬難得。北京作為我們國家的政治、文化和經濟中心，是我們認識國家政策和宏觀戰略的最佳窗口。參觀科技產業公司和工廠，與人民法院、外交部和投資銀行等作交流可以讓大家全面感受這座城市的歷史底蘊與現代活力和實力，相信這對我們理解「一帶一路」倡議的政策背景和推動意義大有裨益。而喀什作為「一帶一路」西部的重要樞紐，大家可以親身體會這項倡議在邊疆地區的具體實踐，相信大家在這城市的所見所聞，包括參觀古城和與仲裁機構、綜合保稅區等的交流，將會為大家帶來許多的啓發。

我特別喜歡這次「帶路行」的口號——「律動未來BRI」，請容許我分享我自己對這個口號的一些想法。「律動」巧妙地融合了法律中的嚴謹及音樂中的節奏感，象徵着法律如同節拍般和諧地帶動着社會運行。「未來」當然是指在座各位香港青年國際法律人才，你們的國際視野和專業精神，將會成為連接香港與「一帶一路」沿線國家法律交流與合作的重要橋樑，未來為「一帶一路」倡議持續注入動力。

因此，我認為「律動未來BRI」不只是一句口號，而是大家參加這次「帶路行」的目標。希望大家通過這次「帶路行」，與不同的參訪單位作深入的交流和分享，親身感受國家在各個領域中的繁榮與穩定發展。憑着你們的專業和熱誠，積極推動「一帶一路」的法治建設，讓香港在未來的國際法律舞台上繼續發光發亮。我希望我們能夠從「律動未來BRI」，進一步實現「律動未來worldwide」。

我感謝每一位參加者的積極投入和支持。這次「帶路行」不單只是學習考察，更是一個交流與合作的平台。希望大家能抱着開放的心態，充分運用這次難能可得的機會，將這次旅程的所見所聞轉化成寶貴的經驗和知識，應用於未來的工作和發展中。

我預祝這次「帶路行」圓滿成功，大家學有所成、收獲滿滿。謝謝！"

立法會二十題：防止虐待兒童,2025-07-16 11:05,2025-07-16 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600278.htm,"以下是今日（七月十六日）在立法會會議上陳曼琪議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據報本港近年屢發生駭人聽聞的虐兒案，包括早前一名送貨員多次虐待親生女兒並引致其死亡，被告最終因謀殺罪成被判終身監禁，而其虐兒罪行則被判監六年五個月。有意見認為現時虐兒最高只可被判監十年，不能反映其嚴重性，亦未能有效制止虐兒發生，加上香港以往曾發生兒童被虐待致死的個案，當局有必要大幅提高虐兒罪行的最高刑罰，以達提高阻嚇性和保護兒童之效。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）當局於去年成功檢控的虐待兒童個案的以下資料：（i）個案宗數、（ii）檢控日期、（iii）判刑日期、（iv）是否涉及直系親屬犯案、（v）有否造成兒童死亡或嚴重人身傷害，以及（vi）被判監的個案所涉刑期；及

（二）有否計劃檢討相關法例，提高相關虐兒罪行的最高刑罰；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直以來採取多管齊下的策略保護兒童，令他們免受傷害或虐待。政府除了及早識別和介入虐待兒童個案以保護兒童，亦會支援有虐兒風險的家庭從源頭上預防虐待兒童。就議員的提問，經徵詢保安局，現綜合回覆如下。

現行多條法例保護兒童免受傷害及虐待，包括《侵害人身罪條例》（第‍212‍章）、《刑事罪行條例》（第‍200‍章）、《防止兒童色情物品條例》（第‍579‍章）及《保護兒童及少年條例》（第‍213‍章）等。

《侵害人身罪條例》（第‍212‍章）第26‍條規定，任何人非法拋棄或遺棄不足兩‍歲的兒童，以致其生命受危害，或以致其健康蒙受或相當可能蒙受永久損害，即屬犯罪；而第27‍條規定，任何超過16‍歲的人如故意襲擊、虐待、忽略、拋棄或遺棄由他所管養、看管或照顧的16‍歲或以下的兒童或少年人，而相當可能導致其受到不必要的苦楚或健康損害，即屬犯罪。在二○二四‍年審結的案件中，根據上述兩項條文而被檢控及被定罪的人數，以及被定罪人士的刑罰載於附件。保安局沒有備存上述案件中被告與受害人關係的資料，或造成死亡或嚴重人身傷害的統計數字。

《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》（《條例》）將於二○二六年一月生效。為加強及早識別和介入虐待兒童個案，《條例》強制社會福利界、教育界和醫療衞生界的指明專業人員舉報嚴重虐兒個案，為兒童編織全面而有效的保護網，同時警告潛在施虐者其虐兒行為容易會被揭發。為配合《條例》生效，政府已於今年一月展開了「保護兒童運動」，加深強制舉報者及市民大眾對《條例》的認知及提升他們對保護兒童的意識。此外，為加強從源頭預防虐兒，社會福利署（社署）會以試驗形式把四間兒童及青年中心轉型為社區親子中心，以遊戲為本的方式促進親子互動及教導家長正向育兒方法，支援有親職需要的家庭，並轉介有其他需要的家庭接受適切的政府及社區服務。社署會透過家訪及醫療服務或福利服務單位的轉介，接觸缺乏社會支援及經濟資源的家庭，並透過深入的個案及小組工作，包括治療性輔導和有系統的度身訂造小組課程，以進一步支援相關家庭。

實施強制舉報機制及成立社區親子中心標誌著保護兒童的重要里程。政府會繼續確保各項支援措施妥善到位，並會在上述措施實施後監察成效，考慮如何進一步加強保護兒童的工作，包括是否有需要提高虐兒罪行的最高刑罰。"
LCQ20: Preventing child abuse,2025-07-16 11:05,2025-07-16 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600280.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Maggie Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 16):

Question:

 It has been reported that Hong Kong has recently witnessed a series of shocking cases of child abuse, including a recent incident where a deliveryman repeatedly abused his biological daughter, leading to her death. The defendant was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, and he was sentenced to imprisonment of six years and five months for his child abuse offence. There are views that as the current maximum penalty of child abuse is only ten years, it fails to fully reflect its severity and effectively prevent child abuse from taking place, and, given that Hong Kong has seen cases of child abuse resulting in death in the past, it is imperative for the authorities to significantly increase the maximum penalty for child abuse offence, so as to enhance deterrence and protect children. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information regarding child abuse cases successfully prosecuted by the authorities last year: (i) number of cases, (ii) date of prosecution, (iii) date of sentence, (iv) whether the perpetrator was a direct relative of the victim, (v) whether the abuse resulted in the death of or grievous bodily harm to the child, and (vi) term of imprisonment in cases where imprisonment was imposed; and

(2) whether it has plans to review relevant legislation to increase the maximum penalty for child abuse offence; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been adopting a multi-pronged strategy to protect children from harm or abuse. Apart from identifying and intervening in child abuse cases at an early stage to protect children, the Government also supports families at risk of child abuse to prevent child abuse at source. The consolidated reply to the Member's question, in consultation with Security Bureau, is as follows:

 At present, there are many pieces of legislation in place that protect children from harm and abuse, including the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212), the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200), the Prevention of Child Pornography Ordinance (Cap. 579) and the Protection of Children and Juveniles Ordinance (Cap. 213).

 Section 26 of the Offences against the Person Ordinance (Cap. 212) provides that any person who unlawfully abandons or exposes a child under the age of 2 years, whereby the life of such child is endangered, or the health of such child is or is likely to be permanently injured, shall be guilty of an offence; and section 27 provides that any person over the age of 16 years who wilfully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, abandons or exposes any child or young person under the age of 16 years under the person's custody, charge or care in a manner likely to cause such child or young person unnecessary suffering or injury to his health shall be guilty of an offence. Among the cases concluded in 2024, the number of persons prosecuted and convicted under the two above-mentioned provisions, as well as the sentences for the persons convicted are at Annex. The Security Bureau does not maintain information about the relationship between the defendant and the victim, and the statistics of the death or severe bodily harm caused in the aforementioned cases.

 The Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance (the Ordinance) will come into effect in January 2026. To strengthen early identification and intervention of child abuse cases, the Ordinance mandates specified professionals in the social welfare sector, education sector and healthcare sector to report serious child abuse cases, thereby creating a wide and effective protection web for children and sending a strong deterrent to potential perpetrators that their abuse behaviours will easily be exposed. To tie in with the commencement of the Ordinance, the Government launched the Child Protection Campaign in January this year to enhance the mandated reporters and the general public's understanding of the Ordinance and raise their awareness of child protection. In addition, to strengthen prevention of child abuse from source, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) will convert four Children and Youth Centres into Community Parents and Children Centres on a pilot basis to promote parent-child interaction through play-based services and instil positive parenting skills in parents, render support for families with parenting needs, and refer families with other needs to appropriate government and community services. Through home visits and referrals from healthcare or welfare service units, the SWD will approach families of socio-economic deprivation and provide them with further support via in-depth casework and group work, including therapeutic counselling and systematic and tailor-made group programmes.

 The implementation of the mandatory reporting regime and the setting up of Community Parents and Children Centres mark an important milestone in child protection. The Government will continue to ensure that the various support measures are properly put in place, and will monitor the effectiveness of the above measures after their implementation to consider how to further enhance child protection work, including the need to increase the maximum penalties for child abuse offences."

Speech by SCST at Publishing 3.0+ Launch Ceremony (English only),2025-07-16 10:37,2025-07-16 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600244.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the Publishing 3.0+ Launch Ceremony today (July 16):

Kenneth (Member of the Legislative Council and the Chairman of Publishing 3.0+, Mr Kenneth Fok), Duncan (Member of the Legislative Council and the Chairman of Publishing 3.0+, Mr Duncan Chiu), Sharon (Executive Director of the Hong Kong Reprographic Rights Licensing Society and the Chairman of Publishing 3.0+, Dr Sharon Wong), Mr Rashid Al Kous (Executive Director of the Emirates Publishers Association), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to officially launch Publishing 3.0+ with industry practitioners, scholars, experts and authors. And let me also extend my warmest welcome to Mr Rashid Al Kous, coming all the way from the United Arab Emirates, and our distinguished guests here from overseas copyright organisations around the world.

Three years ago, the then Create Hong Kong, which is now restructured as the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency, CCIDA, under my bureau, began sponsoring and steering the Publishing 3.0 project, as a touchstone of an in-depth application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the publishing industry, enabling the extensive production of e-books and audiobooks. The project enabled around 60 Hong Kong publishers to successfully convert paper publications into 5 000 bilingual e-books and audiobooks in Cantonese, Putonghua and English, seizing the tremendous opportunity of digital transformation.

Publishing 3.0+ builds on the success of its predecessor. This enhanced project will focus on large language models within the AI-driven system, and further strengthen its multilingual translation and content conversion capabilities, empower local publishers to convert Chinese books into multi-languages, and open doors to a global readership. Publishing 3.0+ will refine the e-books and audiobooks converted over the past years, and further deliver another 5 000 translated and converted copies of books.

The fruitful expected outcome of 10 000 e-books and audiobooks will be showcased in the Hong Kong pavilions at various international book fairs in the coming months. We will further leverage the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC)'s Asia IP Exchange, AsiaIPEX, to facilitate and encourage the industry to tap into the vast opportunities of copyright trading.

President Xi Jinping has emphasised that literature and art serve as bridges of mutual understanding and communication among different countries and ethnic groups. With a considerable amount of foreign classics on his reading list, President Xi repeatedly shared his deep and inseparable bond with books on international occasions when meeting foreign friends. We see that books are media that help foster friendships and exchanges between cultures.

With the great delight of having our Middle East friend here today, may I share our exciting plan that Publishing 3.0+ will soon expand to include Arabic translation. During my official visit to the Middle East in April this year, I was deeply impressed by the region's rich cultural and historical heritage. I am most delighted that Publishing 3.0+ will contribute to our effort to realising closer cultural links and friendship between the Middle East and Hong Kong, aligning the shared visions of both regions.

Publishing 3.0+ is a collaboration of multiple parties. I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to Kenneth, Duncan and Sharon, the founder of InnoContent, whose unique blend of cultural insight, technological innovation and publishing expertise has been instrumental in realising this project. My special thanks also go to SenseTime for its unparalleled AI expertise and infrastructure, which enhance the system's capabilities, and the Hong Kong Publishing Federation, the Hong Kong Reprographic Rights Licensing Society, and the Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre for their unwavering support since the last project, and the HKTDC for its efforts in the intellectual property trading.

Before I close, I wish Publishing 3.0+ a striking success under the collaborative efforts by the Government, the publishing industry and technology partners. I look forward to seeing Hong Kong's AI-driven publishing sector reaches new heights, telling the good story of Hong Kong. Through this initiative, we will showcase creativity, vitality, and innovation in the age of new media.

Thank you very much."

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-16 10:20,2025-07-16 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/16/P2025071600255.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

Members of the delegation, including the Permanent Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Ms Shirley Lam; the Director of Home Affairs, Ms Priscilla To; and the Deputy Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs (Home Affairs), Mr Paul Wong, also accompanied her.
  
Miss Mak called on the Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang, today and reported on the work of the HYAB. These include the latest developments and future work plans of district governance, youth development and women's affairs. She expressed gratitude to the HKMAO of the State Council for their support and guidance to the HYAB.

Miss Mak also called on the Vice Minister of the Society Work Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Mr He Zhiliang, to exchange views on grassroots governance work. District governance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has entered a new phase, and the Government fully implements executive-led governance. The District Councils, ""the three district committees"" and Care Teams form a troika after improvements to district governance. Under the leadership of the District Officers, they co-operate to serve citizens in need and create synergy. The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) and the Home Affairs Department also organise training regularly to enhance District Council (DC) members' capabilities in discharging their duties, such as arranging visits to Shanghai and Zhejiang for the DC members last year to learn about grassroots governance experiences in the country. Miss Mak said that the HYAB will continue to unite district forces and enhance service efficiency to increase the sense of happiness and contentment of the public.
  
Miss Mak then met with the Vice Minister of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, Mr Wang Zhigang, to exchange views on religious affairs. Miss Mak said that the HKSAR Government maintains close communication with religious groups in Hong Kong. She also pointed out the harmonious relationship between different religious groups and that they not only promote their teachings but also provide education, medical and welfare services, making significant contributions to building a harmonious community.
  
The inauguration ceremony of the Youth Internship Programme at Chinese Academy of Sciences was held in the afternoon. The six-week Programme is an important co-operation project co-organised by the HYAB and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It provides Hong Kong youth with high-end scientific research internship opportunities during summer vacation every year.
  
Miss Mak congratulated the 20 Hong Kong young people who stood out in the highly competitive selection process. Speaking at the ceremony, she said that the National 14th Five-Year Plan has established Hong Kong's development into an international innovation and technology centre. Seizing the opportunities, the HKSAR Government is committed to nurturing scientific research talents, and the Programme serves as an important step in grooming future technology leaders. Miss Mak expressed her hope that the Programme would inspire students' passion for scientific research and serve as the starting point for their contributions to the country and Hong Kong's innovation and technology development in the future. 
   
Miss Mak will visit Hong Kong youth participating in the Mainland legal internship programme sponsored by the HYAB Funding Scheme for Youth Internship in the Mainland and organised by the International Youth Legal Exchange Federation tomorrow morning (July 16). She will learn about their experiences interning at Mainland law firms and large enterprises. Miss Mak will conclude her trip to Beijing and depart for Sichuan at noon, while several members of the delegation will return to Hong Kong."

尊敬的韓聖健副省長（黑龍江省人民政府副省長）、劉澤禮總經理（大灣區航空有限公司中國區銷售總經理）、姜彩燕助理總幹事（香港聖公會福利協會助理總幹事）、各位嘉賓、各位「共創明『Teen』計劃」的學員：

大家好！今天我很高興再一次來到哈爾濱，出席「共創明『Teen』計劃」——香港愛國主義教育黑龍江研學團的啓動禮。首先我要感謝韓聖健副省長，因為我知道他一會就要離開黑龍江去公幹，還要特意出來出席這個典禮，我希望大家用最熱烈的掌聲感謝他。

「共創明『Teen』計劃」這個由香港特區政府牽頭，通過政、商、民三方通力合作推行的計劃，今年已經邁進第三期。計劃舉辦了很多豐富和多元化的活動，提升學員的自信心，協助他們建立正向人生觀；我們也舉辦不同類型的研學團，擴闊學員的眼界，幫助他們為自己的未來定下目標，力爭上游。

我出席了不少計劃下的團體活動，但參加這次黑龍江研學團我覺得是有特別的意義，因為今次研學團有兩個「最」。
​
第一個「最」，是「最遠」。研學團到訪的黑龍江哈爾濱，是我們同學至今走得最遠的地方。黑龍江省位於我國的東北地區，不但有壯麗的自然風光，也承載着豐富的歷史文化和民俗風情。每到冬季，這裏更有舉世聞名的冰雕藝術。

特別值得一提，黑龍江聚居着不同民族的同胞，我們可以在這裏親身感受少數民族獨特的民俗風情。而隨着國家科技的快速發展，黑龍江也湧現許多高新科技產業。希望通過這次交流活動，學員們能夠深入了解中華文化的多樣性、親身感受科技創新的魅力以及增進對祖國發展的認識。

第二個「最」，是「最多」。今次活動共有超過130名學員參與，來自不同的地區營辦機構。這是計劃開辦以來，最多學員參加的研學團。

要組織這個最多「共創明『Teen』計劃」學員參加的研學團，其實一點也不容易。在這裏，我要首先衷心感謝黑龍江政府大力支持這次研學團的組織工作，以及熱情接待。當中安排了不少具標誌性的參觀活動，例如參觀侵華日軍第七三一部隊罪証陳列館、北大荒博物館等，讓大家認清歷史，以及見證多年來建設祖國的艱苦歷程；另外也安排了參觀工廠及航天館等，讓學員認識祖國先進的科技及航天發展。

此外，我也要衷心感謝大灣區航空贊助是次活動的機票，並特別為研學團學員安排包機，令大家只需四個多小時直航時間，就能從香港直接抵達哈爾濱，爭取更多時間認識黑龍江。

我亦要特別多謝聖公會福利協會協助籌辦活動。我知道這次研學團活動的籌備時間十分緊迫，但你們都能夠安排得非常妥當，這麼豐富和多姿多彩的行程，實在非常感謝。

最後，我希望參與今次研學團的學員積極參與各項活動，進一步了解國家的歷史和發展。我祝願香港愛國主義教育黑龍江研學團圓滿成功，各位學員收獲滿滿，在座各為身心康泰、工作順利！謝謝大家！"

麥美娟亦拜訪中共中央社會工作部副部長賀志亮，就基層治理工作進行交流。香港特區的地區治理已進入新階段，政府充分實現行政主導。區議會、地區三會、關愛隊是完善地區治理後的「三駕馬車」，在民政事務專員的領導下，他們互相合作為有需要的市民服務，發揮協同效應。民青局及民政事務總署亦定期組織培訓，提升區議員的履職能力，當中包括去年安排區議員前往上海、浙江考察培訓，了解國家基層治理經驗。麥美娟表示民青局會繼續團結地區力量，增強服務效能，致力提升市民的幸福感和獲得感。

麥美娟恭賀20位香港青年能在競爭激烈的選拔過程中脫穎而出。她致辭時說，國家「十四五」規劃中，確立發展香港成為國際創新科技中心。面對這樣的機遇，特區政府致力培養更多科研人才，而「中國科學院青年實習計劃」正是培育未來科技領袖的重要一步。麥美娟期望實習計劃能啟發同學們對科研的熱愛，更成為他們未來為國家及香港創科事業出力的起點。

麥美娟明日（七月十六日）早上將會探訪由「民青局青年內地實習資助計劃」資助、國際青年法律交流聯會主辦的內地法律專業實習項目的香港青年，了解他們在內地律師事務所和大型企業實習的親身體驗。她將於中午結束北京行程轉往四川訪問，而部分代表團成員會返回香港。"
TAC welcomes Government's proposal to regulate online hailing hire car services,2025-07-15 20:52,2025-07-15 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500774.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Transport Advisory Committee:

The Transport Advisory Committee (TAC) welcomes the Government's submission of the legislative proposal to regulate online hailing hire car services to the Legislative Council Panel on Transport.

The Chairman of the TAC and the Working Group for Enhancing Personalised Point-to-Point Transport Services (Working Group), Professor Stephen Cheung, said, ""The development density of Hong Kong is high, with nearly 90 per cent of commuters using public transport. We agree with the Government's adherence to a public transport oriented policy and the effective utilisation of limited road resources. With advancements in technology and changing travel patterns, booking and providing personalised point-to-point transport services through online hailing platforms have become an international trend. Various sectors of society, the taxi trade and online hailing platform companies have been calling on the Government to regulate online hailing hire car services, with a view to creating a healthy and sustainable competitive environment for the personalised point-to-point transport market.""

  ""The TAC welcomes the Government's legislative proposal to regulate online hailing hire car services from three aspects, namely platforms, vehicles, and drivers, to ensure that the services provided comply with legal requirements and regulations relating to safety standards and service quality. This will help safeguard passengers' safety and rights and meet the travel needs of the public. The TAC expects that, after the relevant regulation has been implemented, taxis will continue to maintain its current advantages and coexist with online hailing hire cars, thereby meeting passengers' diversified transport demands."" Professor Cheung continued.

The TAC established the Working Group in July last year to advise the Government on the regulation of online hailing hire car services. The Working Group comprises a number of TAC members, representatives from relevant agencies/departments, namely the Insurance Authority and the Tourism Commission, as well as representatives from the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Transport Department. In February this year, the Working Group met with representatives from the taxi trade and online hailing platform companies to gather their views and suggestions, and subsequently received views from various taxi trade representatives, online hailing platform companies and the public regarding the regulation of online hailing hire car services. The Working Group has previously submitted the views collected, along with the research findings on the regulation of online hailing hire car services in other regions, to the Government."

交通諮詢委員會（交諮會）歡迎政府向立法會交通事務委員會提交規管網絡預約出租汽車（網約車）服務的立法建議。

交諮會主席暨「提升個人化點對點交通服務工作小組」主席張仁良教授說：「香港的發展密度高，目前接近九成的出行人次均使用公共交通服務。我們認同政府以公共交通為本，有效運用有限的道路資源的政策。而隨着科技進步和出行模式改變，近年透過網約渠道預訂及提供個人化點對點交通服務已成為國際趨勢。社會各界、的士業界和網約平台公司均期望政府盡快規管網約車服務，為個人化點對點交通服務市場締造一個良性及可持續發展的競爭環境。」

張仁良教授續說:「交諮會歡迎政府提出規管網約車服務的立法建議，並從平台、車輛及司機三方面着手，確保所提供的服務符合法例、有關安全標準和服務質素的規管要求，以保障乘客安全和權益，滿足和便利市民出行需要。交諮會期望在有關規管落實後，的士會繼續保持現時的優勢，亦與網約車兩者並存互補，滿足乘客多元化的出行需求。」

交諮會於去年七月成立工作小組，就如何規管網約車服務向政府提供意見，成員包括部分交諮會委員、相關機構／部門（保險業監管局和旅遊事務署）代表，以及運輸及物流局和運輸署代表。工作小組今年二月分別與的士業界及網約車平台公司代表會面，聽取他們的意見和建議，其後亦收到不同的士業界代表、網約車平台公司及公眾人士就規管網約車服務的意見。工作小組早前已向政府提交所收到的意見，以及就其他地區規管網約車服務的經驗的調研結果。"

中心發言人說：「中心透過恆常食物監測計劃，從九龍城一間持冰凍甜點製造廠牌照的零售店鋪抽取上述樣本進行檢測。結果顯示，該樣本的大腸菌群含量為每克一百二十個，總含菌量為每克二十二萬個，均超出法例上限。」

Frozen yoghurt sample detected with coliform bacteria and total bacterial counts exceeding legal limits,2025-07-15 19:44,2025-07-15 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500710.htm,"  âThe Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (July 15) that a sample of frozen yoghurt was found to contain coliform bacteria and total bacterial counts exceeding the legal limits. The CFS is following up on the incident.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a retail shop with a frozen confection factory licence in Kowloon City for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained 120 coliform bacteria per gram and 220 000 bacteria per gram, both exceeding the legal limits.

  ""The CFS conducted an investigation of the premises immediately, took food samples for laboratory testing, and informed the food premises concerned of the irregularity. The investigation revealed that the frozen yoghurt was produced in the premises concerned. The premises has already stopped selling the frozen yoghurt, and discarded the affected product according to the CFS's advice. The CFS has also provided health education on food safety and hygiene to the person-in-charge and staff of the premsises, and requested the staff to carry out a thorough cleaning and disinfection,"" the spokesman said.

Under the Frozen Confections Regulation (Cap. 132AC), frozen confection for sale should not contain more than 100 coliform bacteria per gram or more than 50 000 bacteria per gram. The maximum penalty for offenders is a fine of $10,000 and three months' imprisonment upon conviction. The fact that the coliform count and the total bacterial count exceeded the legal limit indicated that the hygienic conditions were unsatisfactory, but did not mean that consumption would lead to food poisoning.

The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. An investigation is ongoing."

註冊中醫涉嫌處方含未標示西藥成分的藥膏被捕（附圖）,2025-07-15 19:35,2025-07-15 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500689.htm,"衞生署今日（七月十五日）表示，銅鑼灣渣甸坊一名註冊中醫涉嫌向病人處方含有未標示西藥成分的藥膏而被捕，市民如曾獲處方該款藥膏應停止使用。

衞生署早前根據情報，突擊搜查京華中心二座註冊中醫陳靖婷的處所，並檢獲一批藥膏。政府化驗所的檢驗結果顯示，兩款沒有標籤的黃色藥膏樣本（見圖）均含有未標示西藥「曲安奈德」、「咪康唑」及「撲熱息痛」成分。當中較大樽（直徑約5.5厘米）的黃色藥膏樣本除上述成分外，亦驗出含一種未標示西藥成分「地塞米松」。因應化驗結果，衞生署今日通知警方，並拘捕該名註冊女中醫，她涉嫌非法管有第1部毒藥及未經註冊藥劑製品。

「地塞米松」及「曲安奈德」屬皮質類固醇，為第1部毒藥及處方藥物，用於治療炎症，不適當使用皮質類固醇可引致嚴重副作用，例如庫欣氏症候群，即出現圓臉及肌肉萎縮等病徵。「咪康唑」亦為第1部毒藥，常用於治療皮膚受真菌感染的藥物，外用可引致皮膚搔癢、刺激性及過敏反應等副作用。「撲熱息痛」普遍用作退燒及鎮痛，使用過量可引致肝臟及腎臟受損。

Registered Chinese medicine practitioner arrested for allegedly prescribing cream products containing undeclared Western drug ingredients (with photo),2025-07-15 19:35,2025-07-15 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500690.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (July 15) said that a registered Chinese medicine practitioner (CMP) at Jardine's Crescent, Causeway Bay, was arrested for allegedly prescribing cream products containing undeclared Western drug ingredients to patients. Members of the public should stop using the ointment if they have been prescribed the cream products concerned.

  Acting upon intelligence, the DH raided CMP Chan Ching-ting's premises in Capitol Centre Tower 2 and seized a batch of cream product for analysis. Test results from the Government Laboratory confirmed that samples of two unlabelled yellow cream products (see photo) contained undeclared Western drug ingredients, namely triamcinolone acetonide, miconazole and paracetamol. In addition to the above ingredients, the large bottle of about 5.5 centimetres in diameter was also found to contain another undeclared Western drug ingredient, dexamethasone. In the light of the test results, the DH notified the police today and arrested the registered female Chinese medicine practitioner, who is suspected of illegal possession of Part 1 poisons and unregistered pharmaceutical products.

  Dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide are corticosteroids. They are Part 1 poisons and prescription medicines for treating inflammation. Inappropriate use of corticosteroids may cause serious side effects such as Cushing's syndrome, with symptoms including moon face and muscle atrophy. Miconazole, a Part 1 poison, is an antifungal medicine commonly used for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin. It can cause side effects such as itching, irritation and an allergic reaction when used topically. Paracetamol is commonly used for its anti-pyretic and analgesic effects but an overdose may cause liver and kidney damage.

  The DH will continue to investigate the case and has requested the CMP concerned to contact her patients who have been prescribed the cream products concerned for medical surveillance.

  According to the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138), illegal possession of Part 1 poisons and unregistered pharmaceutical products are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for each offenceupon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. Upon completion of the investigations, the DH will consult the Department of Justice on prosecution matters. The DH would refer the case to the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong for consideration of possible disciplinary action.

  Members of the public who have been prescribed with cream products by the above CMP who feel unwell or are in doubt should consult healthcare professionals as soon as possible. They may submit the medicines concerned to the DH's Chinese Medicine Regulatory Office at 16/F, AIA Kowloon Tower, Landmark East, 100 How Ming Street, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, during office hours for disposal."

15 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-07-15 18:00,2025-07-15 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500629.htm,"The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Lightshadow"" to combat illegal food delivery couriers from late June to today (July 15). During the anti-illegal worker operations, a total of eight suspected illegal workers and seven suspected aiders and abettors were arrested by ImmD Task Force officers.

 The eight arrested suspected illegal workers are non-ethnic Chinese males aged 25 to 55. Among them, seven men were found to be holders of recognisance forms and were non-refoulement claimants, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong.

 Furthermore, the seven suspected aiders and abettors are Hong Kong residents aged 33 to 52. The six men and one woman were arrested for being suspected of a conspiracy to defraud delivery platforms by selling or renting their food delivery courier accounts to the illegal workers.

 An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

 The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrantif the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable with imprisonment for not less than two years.""

 The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

 According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman reminded all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

 Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."
反非法勞工行動拘十五人（附圖）,2025-07-15 18:00,2025-07-15 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500626.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於六月下旬至今日（七月十五日）在全港多區展開代號為「光影行動」的反非法勞工行動，以打擊非法外賣員。行動中入境處特遣隊人員共拘捕八名懷疑非法勞工及七名涉嫌協助及教唆者。

被捕的懷疑非法勞工為八名非華裔男子，年齡介乎二十五至五十五歲，當中七名男子為免遣返聲請人士，並持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。

此外，七名涉嫌協助及教唆者均為香港居民，共六男一女，年齡介乎三十三至五十二歲。他們亦因涉嫌出售或租借外賣員帳號予非法勞工，串謀詐騙外賣平台而被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
"LegCo Secretariat releases Policy Pulse on ""Strategies and edges of Hong Kong in hydrogen development""",2025-07-15 17:26,2025-07-15 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/15/P2025071500548.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

  The Legislative Council (LegCo) Secretariat today (July 15) released the latest issue of the Policy Pulse on ""Strategies and edges of Hong Kong in hydrogen development"". This issue provides a brief overview of hydrogenenergy development strategies in Hong Kong, the edges of promoting the hydrogenenergy industry, the latest progress of improving relevant legislation by the Government, as well as relevant discussions of LegCo along with suggestions by Members.

  LegCo will resume the Second Reading debate on the Gas Safety (Amendment) Bill 2025 tomorrow (July 16). The Bill seeks to regulate the use of hydrogen as fuel to ensure the safe application of hydrogen fuel. It also empowers the Government to introduce new subsidiary legislation to ensure the flexibility of updating the regulatory requirements. The Government intends to introduce subsidiary legislation in 2026 to cover the entire supply chain of hydrogen as fuel.

  The Policy Pulse highlights that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government actively promotes the development of hydrogen energy, and promulgated the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong last year. Setting out four major strategies of improving legislation, establishing standards, aligning with the market and advancing with prudence, the Strategy aims to create an environment conducive to the development of hydrogen energy in Hong Kong in an orderly manner, so as to make preparations for the wider application of hydrogen energy in the future.

  With a ""zero carbon emissions"" feature, hydrogen is a new energy with significant decarbonisation potential. Our country is the largest hydrogen producer in the world, and strives to achieve the ""dual carbon"" goals of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. The SAR Government also targets to cut carbon emissions by half from the 2005 level before 2035 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. The Policy Pulse points out that, with its unique advantage of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, as well as the strengths in scientific research, robust legislation and energy infrastructure, Hong Kong has very great potential to become a demonstration base for the development of hydrogen energy in the country, and facilitate the development of the hydrogenenergy industry in the Belt and Road region and other overseas places. In addition, as an international financial centre, Hong Kong can help enterprises with their green transformation by providing green financing and professional services.

  The Policy Pulse also introduces a number of measures by the SAR Government to support research and innovation in the hydrogen energy technology. These include setting up the Inter-departmental Working Group on Using Hydrogen as Fuel to co-ordinate the efforts in promoting the local use of hydrogen energy and initiate relevant trial projects. Meanwhile, the Government has launched several funding schemes that cover the research and development of hydrogen energy technology, and actively promotes talent training, technological exchange and application in relevant scientific and technological fields, so as to cultivate professionals with the specialised knowledge and skills to ensure the safe application of hydrogen energy technology.

  LegCo Members have long attached great importance to the development of hydrogen energy in Hong Kong. In March 2023, LegCo passed a motion advocating the SAR Government to comprehensively promote the development of hydrogenenergy industry in Hong Kong. The LegCo Panel on Environmental Affairs also visited hydrogen projects during its duty visit to Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (the Greater Bay Area) in August of the same year, and has been following up on issues related to hydrogen energy. The Policy Pulse summarises various recommendations made by Members on hydrogen energy development. These include capitalising on the strengths of Hong Kong's financial services industry to attract capital investment in the city's hydrogenenergy industry and reserve land for development. Furthermore, the Government should take the lead in developing green industries and make use of new development areas as a springboard to bring in quality hydrogenenergy industries; formulate relevant policies on hydrogen energy pricing to stimulate demand for hydrogen energy; promote carbon index certification to include hydrogen energy into Hong Kong's carbon emissions trading market; and actively research and develop local hydrogen production technology, among others.

  The Policy Pulse points out that hydrogen energy is an integral component of the country's future energy system. Members urge the Government to collaborate with other cities in the Greater Bay Area on the joint research, development and promotion of hydrogen energy development projects to facilitate exchanges and co-operation between the two places across the hydrogen energy industrial chain, with a view to promoting the alignment of the safety monitoring and quality testing standards between Hong Kong and the Mainland. Members also advise the Government to speed up the development of a set of internationally recognised hydrogen energy certification standards, so as to assist the Greater Bay Area and even the entire hydrogen industry in the country to enter the international market.

  The detailed content of ""Strategies and edges of Hong Kong in hydrogen development"" is available on the LegCo Website. The Policy Pulse, published by the Council Business Divisions of the LegCo Secretariat, covers specific topics and offers a comprehensive overview of related policy developments and summarised discussions in LegCo."
