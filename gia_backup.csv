保安局局長在立法會保安事務委員會會議就更生同行--懲教署為在囚人士提供的更生服務開場發言（只有中文）,2025-09-09 17:50,2025-09-09 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900708.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（九月九日）出席立法會保安事務委員會會議就更生同行—懲教署為在囚人士提供的更生服務的開場發言︰

主席：

懲教署一直致力確保羈管環境穩妥、安全、人道、合適和健康，同時為在囚人士提供適切的更生服務。懲教署一直肩負「更生同行者」的角色，全面落實各項措施，以多管齊下的方式加強更生工作，包括透過提供全方位的教育和進修機會、與時並進的技能培訓、針對性的心理輔導、行為和思想矯正、適切的更生計劃及就業支援，以及多元化的釋後監管和支援服務，強化在囚人士改過的決心、將更生計劃由圍牆內伸延至圍牆外，同時努力爭取社會各界積極參與和支持更生工作，協助在囚人士改過自新，重投社會。

接下來，我會重點介紹懲教署近年在不同方面的更生工作。

在教育方面，為協助在囚人士創造更多向上流的機會，懲教署在二○二三年十月在白沙灣懲教所和羅湖懲教所設立「立德學院」，為自願參與的成年在囚人士提供一年全日制應用教育文憑課程。

為進一步協助已經考取應用教育文憑的在囚人士獲取進階資歷，懲教署於上年九月在「立德學院」開設通識教育副學士課程，提供兩年全日制遙距課程的升學選擇。懲教署亦同時將「立德學院」擴展至壁屋監獄，為未能在餘下刑期內完成副學士學位的「立德學院」畢業生，提供半日通識教育副學士課程和半日職業訓練，讓他們能夠接受短期升學和職業訓練，協助他們繼續裝備自己，為即將獲釋重投社會做好準備。

在職業訓練方面，懲教署為青少年在囚人士提供13項市場導向的職業訓練課程，以及為將於24個月內獲釋並可合法居留受僱的成年在囚人士，開辦超過40項自願參與的職業訓練課程，提供超過1700個訓練名額。這些課程都由本地培訓機構協辦，並且獲資歷架構或市場認證，有助更生人士就業和報讀銜接或進階課程。

在就業方面，為協助在囚人士獲得更多向上流動的機會，懲教署近年推出「『招』『職』創未來」計劃，為他們提供「一條龍」培訓和工作發展機會，鼓勵他們及早規劃人生，發揮所長，並為社會作出貢獻。計劃內容包括生涯規劃、所內培訓、釋後實習、正式聘請以及師友計劃。

在行為和思想矯正方面，針對因涉及「黑暴」事件和違反《香港國安法》或《維護國家安全條例》的在囚人士的特殊更生需要，懲教署繼續在「沿途有『理』」計劃下，致力按三大更生計劃方向，分別為認識中國歷史和加強國民教育、心理和價值觀重整，以及生涯規劃和家庭關係重修，協助他們重新建立正確的價值觀，積極面對往後人生路上的各種挑戰。

在心理輔導方面，懲教署在上年於羅湖懲教所和豐力樓開展「更生輔助犬服務」，向有需要的在囚人士提供動物輔助治療，改善他們的抑鬱和焦慮情緒，並減低他們的暴力傾向。另外，亦在豐力樓推行的「更生輔助犬服務實習生計劃」，讓中途宿舍受訓生通過照顧更生輔助犬，提升自信心和培養責任感。懲教署還安排受訓生和更生輔助犬到長者服務中心進行關愛探訪服務，藉此回饋社會。

在釋後更生支援方面，懲教署近年新設四間多用途家庭及更生服務中心，進一步加強為更生人士，和他們的家人提供個人和小組輔導服務，以及便利在囚人士家屬進行視像探訪。懲教署亦於去年在屯門和上水兩間多用途家庭及更生服務中心設立家庭治療中心，為正接受法定監管的戒毒者，以及有暴力傾向或思想激進的更生人士舉辦不同類型的治療項目，將在囚期間的心理和家庭輔導服務延伸至社區，協助他們與家人重修關係。

另外，懲教署在去年成立更生服務研究組，目的是通過推動研究工作和參考國際最新的研究結果，開展實證為本的更生服務。

過去20多年，香港的再犯率跌幅非常明顯，由二○○○年的39.9%下降至二○二二年的21.8%，這個得來不易的成果，正正反映懲教署一直以來的堅持和努力、在囚和更生人士改過的決心，以及社會各界對助更新工作的支持。

展望未來，懲教署會繼續因應社會的轉變和需要，積極檢討和加強各項更生服務和計劃，以及與各界攜手，在社區內積極推動更生工作。

多謝主席。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-09 17:30,2025-09-09 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900634.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月九日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三十一日至九月六日）廣東省新增178宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別225宗（八月二十四日至三十日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的新增病例數字過去一個月持續遞減，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-09 17:30,2025-09-09 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900636.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 9), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 178 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 31 to September 6), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 225 cases (August 24 to 30) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are still experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
醫務衞生局局長見證香港中醫醫院與三間本地大學簽署合作協議,2025-09-09 17:25,2025-09-09 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900354.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月九日）出席香港中醫醫院與三間設有中醫或中醫藥學院的本地大學（即香港浸會大學（浸大）、香港中文大學（中大）和香港大學（港大））合作協議簽署儀式，見證香港中醫醫院作為相關大學的中醫藥教學醫院，與大學建立緊密合作夥伴關係，共同推動本港中醫藥高質量、高水平及全方位發展。

盧寵茂教授說：「香港中醫醫院今日正式成為三間大學的中醫藥教學醫院，是香港中醫藥服務、教學培訓及科研發展的重要里程碑。我期望香港中醫醫院與三間大學發揮協同效應，為市民提供更優質的中醫服務，並推動中醫藥教學培訓和科研創新。特區政府會繼續全力支持香港中醫醫院與各持份者攜手合作，善用粵港澳大灣區的發展平台，同時充分發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，為國家中醫藥發展作出貢獻。」

香港中醫醫院的臨床服務涵蓋六個中醫分科服務，包括中醫內科、中醫外科、中醫婦科、中醫兒科、中醫骨傷科及中醫針灸科，三間大學的中醫藥專家將會參與其中，並共同制訂臨床標準與指引，讓醫院為市民提供優質安全的服務。與此同時，作為三間大學的中醫藥教學醫院，香港中醫醫院會為本科生和研究生提供本地臨床實習及深造培訓機會，成為中醫藥人才培訓的重要基地。此外，醫院的多樣化病例，可以與各大學的頂尖科研實力結合，共同推進中醫藥科研發展，包括中成藥研發和臨床研究。香港中醫醫院亦會透過三間大學的國際學術網絡，積極加強與內地和海外同儕的合作，共同助力中醫藥走向國際。

在簽署儀式上，盧寵茂教授、浸大校長衞炳江教授（香港中醫醫院代表）與三間大學代表——浸大副校長（研究及拓展）呂愛平教授、中大醫學院院長趙偉仁教授和港大副校長（健康）暨李嘉誠醫學院院長劉澤星教授，共同見證香港中醫醫院營運機構董事局主席王桂壎分別與浸大中醫藥學院院長李敏教授、中大中醫學院院長林志秀教授，以及港大李嘉誠醫學院副院長（臨床事務）暨香港大學醫療系統總監黃穎兒教授簽署合作協議。香港中醫醫院行政總監卞兆祥教授亦有出席儀式後舉行的傳媒簡報會。

位於將軍澳百勝角路一號的香港中醫醫院採用公私營協作模式，由政府全資興建。政府在二○二一年透過招標程序委託浸大作為承辦機構，而浸大其後亦按服務契約的要求，於同年成立一所擔保有限公司作為營運機構，負責該院的管理、營運及保養。香港中醫醫院將於今年十二月起分階段投入服務。"

He witnessed CMHHK, as the Chinese medicine (CM) teaching hospital for the respective universities, establish a close partnership with the universities to promote the high-quality and high-standard development of CM in Hong Kong on all fronts.

Professor Lo said, ""Today, CMHHK becomes the CM teaching hospital for the three universities, which marks a significant milestone in the development of CM services, training and education, and scientific research in Hong Kong. I expect CMHHK and the three universities to create synergy in providing better CM services for members of the public, as well as fostering training and education, and scientific research and innovation in CM. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to give full support to the CMHHK in collaborating with various stakeholders to make good use of the development platform of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and fully leverage Hong Kong's unique advantage of enjoying strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world, with a view to contributing to the national development of CM.""

The clinical services of CMHHK cover six specialised CM services, namely Internal Medicine in CM, External Medicine in CM, Gynaecology in CM, Paediatrics in CM, Orthopaedics and Traumatology in CM and Acupuncture and Moxibustion in CM. CM experts from the three universities will participate in these services and jointly formulate clinical standards and guidelines, enabling CMHHK to provide quality and safe services for members of the public. Meanwhile, as the CM teaching hospital for the three universities, CMHHK will provide local clinical placements and advanced training opportunities for undergraduates and postgraduates, serving as an important base for nurturing CM talent. In addition, the hospital's diverse clinical cases, coupled with the top-tier research capabilities of the universities, will foster CM scientific research development, including proprietary Chinese medicines development and clinical research. CMHHK will also strengthen co-operation with counterparts on the Mainland and overseas through the international academic networks of the three universities, thereby facilitating CM's going global with concerted effort.

At the signing ceremony, Professor Lo; the President and Vice-Chancellor of HKBU, Professor Alexander Wai (representative of CMHHK); and representatives of the three universities, namely the Vice-President (Research and Development) of HKBU, Professor Lyu Aiping; the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the CUHK, Professor Philip Chiu; and the Vice-President and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Health) and Dean of the LKS Faculty of Medicine of the HKU, Professor Lau Chak-sing, jointly witnessed the signing of agreements by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of CMHHK Operator, Mr Huen Wong, with the Dean of the School of Chinese Medicine of HKBU, Professor Li Min; the Director of the School of Chinese Medicine of the CUHK, Professor Lin Zhixiu; and the Associate Dean (Clinical Affairs) of the LKS Faculty of Medicine of HKU and Director of HKU Health System, Professor Victoria Wong, respectively. The Hospital Chief Executive of CMHHK, Professor Bian Zhaoxiang, also attended the media briefing held after the signing ceremony.

Located at 1 Pak Shing Kok Road in Tseung Kwan O, CMHHK adopts a public-private partnership model with its construction fully funded by the Government. The Government commissioned HKBU as the Contractor through tendering procedures in 2021. HKBU subsequently incorporated a company limited by guarantee in the same year in accordance with the service deed to act as the operator for managing, operating and maintaining the hospital.

Quarterly business receipts indices for service industries for second quarter of 2025,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900575.htm,"  Business receipts in value terms of most of the major service industries showed increases of varying magnitudes in the second quarter of 2025 when compared with the second quarter of 2024, according to the provisional figures of business receipts indices released today (September 9) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  Comparing the second quarter of 2025 with the second quarter of 2024, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the financing (except banking) (+27.7%), import/export trade (+21.2%), insurance (+20.7%) and banking (+14.5%) industries. On the other hand, the real estate industry recorded a decrease of 8.1% in business receipts index during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 75.6% year-on-year during the same period, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 9.6% year-on-year.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, business receipts in value terms of around half of the major service industries recorded increases of varying magnitudes in the second quarter of 2025 when compared with the first quarter of 2025. In particular, business receipts indices of the financing (except banking) and real estate industries increased by 3.5% and 3.0% respectively. On the other hand, business receipts index of the insurance industry decreased by 13.9% during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, comparing the second quarter of 2025 with the first quarter of 2025 on a seasonally adjusted basis, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 10.0%, whereas that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain decreased by 5.6%.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business receipts of most service industries recorded increases in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. More notable increases in business receipts were seen for the financing (except banking), import/export trade, insurance, and banking industries.

  Looking ahead, the continued economic expansion should benefit the business of various service industries. Though some industries may be more affected by external uncertainties, steady economic growth in Asia particularly the Mainland, sustained increases in local employment earnings, together with the Government's various measures to boost the economy and attract investment, would provide support to different service industries.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the business receipts indices and their corresponding year-on-year rates of change in respect of selected service industries and service domains for the recent five quarters, while Table 2 shows the corresponding quarter-to-quarter rates of change in the business receipts indices for the recent five quarters based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The revised figures of business receipts indices for the second quarter of 2025 will be released at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=660-69001) on October 17, 2025.

  Data for compiling the business receipts indices are mainly based on the Quarterly Survey of Service Industries conducted by the C&SD, supplemented by relevant data provided by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

  A service domain differs from a service industry in that it comprises those economic activities which straddle different industries but are somehow related to a common theme. It may include all activities carried out by all establishments in a service industry that is closely related to the domain. For a service industry that is less closely related, however, only a portion of the establishments in the industry or even only part of the economic activities of the establishments is related to the domain. Taking the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain as an example, it includes all services of convention and exhibition organisers, short-term accommodation services and services of travel agents, and some of the services (only those involving visitors as customers) of restaurants, retailers and transport operators.

  The classification of service industries follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into relevant industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""Quarterly Business Receipts Indices for Service Industries, Second Quarter 2025"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520).

二零二五年第二季服務行業按季業務收益指數,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900414.htm,"政府統計處今日（九月九日）發表的業務收益指數的臨時數字顯示，二零二五年第二季與二零二四年第二季比較，大部分主要服務行業以價值計算的業務收益均有不同程度的升幅。

二零二五年第二季與二零二四年第二季比較，金融業（銀行除外）（+27.7%）、進出口貿易業（+21.2%）、保險業（+20.7%）及銀行業（+14.5%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，地產業的業務收益指數同期則下跌8.1%。

按服務界別分析，電腦及資訊科技服務界別的業務收益指數同期按年上升75.6%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別的業務收益指數亦按年上升9.6%。

二零二五年第二季與二零二五年第一季比較，約一半主要服務行業經季節性調整的業務收益（以價值計算）均錄得不同程度的升幅。當中，金融業（銀行除外）及地產業的業務收益指數按季分別上升3.5%和3.0%。另一方面，保險業的業務收益指數同期則下跌13.9%。

按服務界別分析，二零二五年第二季與二零二五年第一季比較，電腦及資訊科技服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數上升10.0%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數則下跌5.6%。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第二季大部分服務行業的業務收益較去年同期上升。較顯著的升幅見於金融業（銀行除外）、進出口貿易業、保險業，以及銀行業。

展望未來，經濟持續擴張應會惠及不同服務行業的業務。儘管一些行業或會較受外圍不確定性所影響，但亞洲尤其是內地經濟穩步增長，本地就業收入持續增加，加上政府多項提振經濟和吸引投資的措施，將為不同服務行業提供支持。

進一步資料

表1載列最近五季選定服務行業及服務界別的業務收益指數及其相應按年變動百分率，而表2則載列最近五季經季節性調整的業務收益指數按季變動百分率。

二零二五年第二季的業務收益指數的修訂數字將於二零二五年十月十七日在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/web_table.html?id=660-69001）發布。

編製業務收益指數所用的數據主要來自政府統計處進行的「服務行業按季統計調查」，並輔以香港金融管理局及香港旅遊發展局提供的有關數據。

服務界別有別於服務行業，前者包括橫跨不同行業但與某個共同主題相關的經濟活動。服務界別可能包括某個服務行業內所有機構單位進行的全部經濟活動，而該服務行業與該服務界別關係密切。然而，在一個與該服務界別關係不太密切的服務行業內，只有部分機構單位甚或只有這些機構單位的部分經濟活動是與該服務界別有關。以旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別為例，這界別包括所有會議展覽機構的服務、短期住宿服務及旅行社所提供的服務，以及食肆、零售商及運輸服務營辦商的部分服務（只包括以旅客為對象的服務）。

服務行業的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各類經濟統計調查，把經濟單位分類歸入合適的行業類別。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《二零二五年第二季服務行業按季業務收益指數》報告內。用戶可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for August 2025,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900391.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (September 9) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for August 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased slightly from 42.1 in July 2025 in the contractionary zone to 42.3 in August 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. September 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.7. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in August 2025 as compared with previous month for some surveyed sectors, including retail trade (from 39.3 to 41.1) and wholesale trade (from 40.4 to 41.3).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades decreased from 45.0 in July 2025 to 44.2 in August 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. September 2025) was 47.0.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month's time both improved slightly further in August. The overall employment situation also turned better.

  Looking ahead, local business sentiment would continue to be affected by the uncertain external environment. Nonetheless, solid growth in the local economy, coupled with steady economic growth in Asia in particular the Mainland, should provide support. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

二零二五年八月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900385.htm,"政府統計處今日（九月九日）發表二零二五年八月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年七月在收縮區域的42.1輕微上升至二零二五年八月的42.3，而未來一個月（即二零二五年九月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.7。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但一些統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年八月較上月上升，包括零售業（從39.3上升至41.1）及批發業（從40.4上升至41.3）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年七月的45.0下跌至二零二五年八月的44.2，而未來一個月（即二零二五年九月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.0。

評論

政府發言人表示，八月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均進一步略為改善。整體就業情況亦見好轉。

展望未來，外圍環境不明朗，將繼續影響本地營商氣氛。儘管如此，本地經濟增長穩健，加上亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，應會提供支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

尊敬的李副主任（國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）副主任李鎮）、各位嘉賓、各位企業家朋友們：

下午好！很高興在這裏與大家齊聚一堂，共同探討內地企業如何利用香港這個獨特的平台，實現全球化的戰略布局。首先，我謹代表香港特區政府，衷心感謝國務院國資委對今天研討會的大力支持，並熱烈歡迎所有遠道而來的內地企業代表和嘉賓朋友們。

習近平主席指出，對外開放是我國的基本國策，我國正在推進高水平對外開放，開放的大門只會越開越大。香港是國家的南大門，在「一國兩制」下，擁有內聯外通、國際化和多元包容的獨特優勢。我們的制度優勢還包括實施普通法；維持自由港地位和自由貿易政策；零關稅和高效的清關手續 、四通八達的物流網絡和港口基建；卓越的金融市場和專業服務等。香港不但是助力內地企業出海的平台，我們蓬勃的金融市場，也能支持內地企業籌募資金發展海外業務。

事實上，我們的優勢獲得國際社會廣泛認同。例如，在瑞士洛桑國際管理發展學院今年發表的《世界競爭力年報》，香港連續兩年上升共四位至全球第三；今年三月的《全球金融中心指數》，香港穩居第三，在亞太稱冠；加拿大菲沙研究所去年也將香港評為全球最自由經濟體。今日剛公布的《2025年世界人才排名》，香港排名全球第四，亞洲第一。

去年，外來駐港公司數量升到9 960家，創下歷史新高，其中來自內地的駐港公司數目最多，佔超過四分之一。

金融服務方面，香港擁有全鏈條的籌融資市場，可為處於不同發展階段的企業提供金融支持。無論是天使投資、風險基金、私募基金、證券市場，還是銀行貸款，香港都能把全球資金跟企業接連起來，全方位多層次支持企業的業務拓展。

特別值得一提的是，香港也是全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，可以為內地企業提供境外人民幣融資，企業也可以把境外人民幣在此進行管理和投資。通過在香港設立財資中心，企業能夠高效地整合和調配全球資金，實現跨境資金池管理、優化流動性配置、降低匯率風險，並提高資金使用效率。香港完善的金融基建、資金自由流動的環境以及與國際接軌的監管體系，為企業海外資金管理提供了安全、便捷、高效的解決方案。

近年來，特區政府積極推動香港發展成為國際創科中心，深化政、產、學、研、投聯動合作。 我們樂見近年不少內地企業在港設立研發中心，推動產品及技術走向全球。事實上，在世界知識產權組織最新發佈的《2025年全球創新指數》中，「深圳—香港—廣州」集群首次位列全球第一，反映粵港澳大灣區的創新能力獲國際高度認可。 香港不僅是大灣區內創新科技產出和加速成長的地方，更為內地科創企業走向全球提供全面的知識產權保護。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，世界百年變局加速演進，近年全球貿易和供應鏈格局重構，為內地企業帶來了挑戰、也創造了機遇。當前內地企業「走出去」到全球南方和「一帶一路」沿線和相關國家，布局供應鏈和產業鏈、並開拓更多元化的市場，已是大勢所趨。因應這大勢，特區政府近年積極推動香港成為服務大家的跨國供應鏈管理中心。特區政府投資推廣署、引進重點企業辦公室和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）建立了機制和專門團隊，聯手助力內地企業來港建立離岸貿易和供應鏈管理的國際和區域總部，為大家提供一站式諮詢服務，協助大家部署環球供應鏈和擴展海外市場。貿發局的海外辦事處亦為內地企業提供在地支援，包括協助企業建立與海外市場的聯繫、了解海外市場法規；提供不同新興國家的市場調查；以及它們在環境、社會和企業管治（ESG）、檢測及認證、出口信用風險管理等方面的資訊。

至今，內地企業通過香港這個平台成功「走出去」的包括來自工程機械界、創意產業界、物流運輸界等。今日多家在港的內地企業代表會跟大家分享他們在香港發展的經驗。

在中央的堅實支持下，我們會竭盡所能支持內地企業出海發展。

歡迎各位積極考慮在香港設立國際業務地區總部、跨國供應鏈管理中心、財資中心、電商中心、知識產權管理中心、科研中心等，讓香港的各種優勢，成就大家的國際化發展。

最後，祝願希望今天的研討會圓滿成功，各位嘉賓朋友事業宏達，身體健康！謝謝大家！"

  The SHYA appointed a supervisory committee on July 18 pursuant to section 72C of the District Councils Ordinance (Cap. 547) to investigate the alleged misconduct of Mr Yip. The supervisory committee submitted a report to the SHYA on September 1. After considering the evidence related to the misconduct, the negative impact of the incident on DC members, DCs and the Government's reputation and credibility, as well as Mr Yip's written representation, the supervisory committee concluded that Mr Yip's dangerous driving conviction constituted misconduct and recommended suspending Mr Yip's functions and duties as a DC member for one week.

  Pursuant to section 72D of the Ordinance and the Performance Monitoring Guidelines for Members of the District Councils, and after considering the report of the supervisory committee, the SHYA concurred with the supervisory committee's opinions that Mr Yip's dangerous driving conviction constituted misconduct, and decided to suspend his functions and duties as a DC member for one week. For the period of suspension, he shall not be entitled to receive any remuneration or allowances, including end-of-service gratuity, but shall be entitled to be reimbursed for the operating expenses incurred, e.g. office rentals and staff salaries, during the period.

  Miss Mak said, ""This is the first time the Government has investigated and imposed sanctions on a DC member for misconduct in accordance with the performance monitoring mechanism for DC members under the improved district governance. The Government places strong emphasis on the conduct and integrity of DC members, and they should conduct themselves in a manner that is in line with public expectations and commensurate with the reputation of the DC and its members. The Government will continue to monitor the performance of DC members to ensure that every DC member upholds their duties to serve the people. The Government would also like to express gratitude to the five members of the supervisory committee for their work and opinions on the case.""

  Mr Yip will be suspended from his functions and duties as a DC member from tomorrow (September 10) to September 16 (both dates inclusive). The DC website has been updated accordingly for public information."

Ambassador Valler (Consul-General of Brazil in Hong Kong, Mr Wladimir Valler Filho), Deputy Commissioner Pan Yundong (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon.

It's a pleasure to be here, today, in celebration of Brazil's National Day – the 203rd anniversary of its Declaration of Independence. On this special occasion, we honour not only the rich history and culture of Brazil but also the enduring friendship between our peoples.

Brazil is a country of enviable superlatives. The world's fifth-largest nation in area, it's also the seventh-largest in population, with some 213 million people.

As Latin America's largest economy, Brazil has built an impressive and diversified industrial base, with globally competitive companies spanning agriculture, manufacturing, aerospace, metallurgy, services, and more.

I'm pleased to say that Brazil is also our key trading partner in Latin America. Last year, Brazil was Hong Kong's largest import source and second-largest export market in the region. Bilateral merchandise trade between our economies last year reached US$3.4 billion - an increase of more than 18 per cent year on year. These figures speak to the strength and potential of our economic ties.

At a time when protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise globally, Brazil continues to champion multilateralism and international co-operation. It has been a steadfast partner to our country, China, in building a multipolar world and a more sustainable planet. These shared values are more important than ever, as we work together to build a more inclusive and resilient global community. 

Last year marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, when President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Brazil. It was a milestone celebrated with the signing of over 30 bilateral agreements. And during President Lula da Silva's state visit to our country in May this year, a further 20 co-operation agreements were concluded, covering a wide range of areas including science and technology, digital economy, finance, and more.

This deepening of co-operation between Brazil and China opens up new and exciting avenues for Hong Kong to strengthen its engagement with Brazil. Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong serves as a vital bridge between China and the rest of the world. We are well positioned to facilitate and expand bilateral ties across business, trade and innovation.

Hong Kong offers a world-class business environment, underpinned by the rule of law, a free and open economy, and a regulatory regime that is aligned with the best international standards and enriched by a vibrant international and diverse community. These core strengths continue to earn us high recognition in global competitiveness rankings and positive feedback from international businesses operating here.

In trade, our zero-tariff regime, efficient logistics, and seamless customs clearance make Hong Kong an ideal gateway for Brazilian goods entering the Greater Bay Area and the broader Chinese and Asian markets. 

One area of particular promise for future collaboration is innovation and technology. Brazil leads Latin America in the number and diversity of its start-ups, reflecting a dynamic and entrepreneurial spirit. Likewise, Hong Kong is emerging as a leading I&T hub, bolstered by the strength of the Greater Bay Area, which hosted an innovation cluster that tops the world in a recent ranking by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

We are actively attracting global talent, companies and start-ups to join our thriving innovation ecosystem, with nearly 30 per cent of start-up founders coming from outside Hong Kong.

It helps that Hong Kong is Asia's leading financial centre, offering a full range of funding options, with deep liquidity, exceptional professional services, and unparalleled international connectivity. For start-ups and innovators, launching here is effectively an international seal of approval. If a start-up can thrive in Hong Kong, it is likely to succeed elsewhere.

Of course, our growing ties are not limited to business alone. We welcome Brazilian music, dance, food and drink, entertainment and, yes, football, too. I had the pleasure of enjoying a taste of Brazilian culture in June, at the opening ceremony of ""Extravaganza! When Brazil Meets Hong Kong"", down by the harbour. It was a joyful and colourful celebration that added vibrancy to Hong Kong's calendar as Asia's events capital.

I am delighted to hear that Brazil's ""Extravaganza"" will return to Hong Kong next year, and I look forward to even more cultural exchanges that bring our communities closer together.

On this note, I wish you a happy national day. Thank you very much."

EDB announces Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors for 2026/27 cohort - undergraduate programmes,2025-09-09 14:30,2025-09-09 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900348.htm,"âThe Education Bureau (EDB) announced today (September 9) that the Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors (SSSDP) will subsidise a total of 4 781 places in 57 undergraduate programmes, covering 3 425 places in 57 first-year-first-degree (FYFD) programmes and 1 356 places in 45 top-up degree (TUD) programmes of eight post-secondary institutions for the cohort to be admitted in the 2026/27 academic year.

The programmes of the SSSDP fall under 10 disciplines that have been identified as having keen manpower demand, namely architecture and engineering, computer science, creative industries, financial technology, healthcare, insurance, logistics, sports and recreation, testing and certification, and tourism and hospitality. The programmes include 16 applied degree programmes, which will receive additional subsidies, with a view to further strengthening the vocational and professional education and training progression pathway at the post-secondary level.

The programmes and numbers of subsidised places under the SSSDP are determined by the EDB in consultation with relevant policy bureaux and departments. Details of the participating institutions, the programmes and the numbers of subsidised places are listed in the Annex. The EDB will continue to work with relevant policy bureaux and departments to explore covering more suitable programmes in the SSSDP.

The annual subsidy amounts for the 2026/27 academic year will remain unchanged at $81,450 for laboratory-based programmes and $46,780 for non-laboratory-based programmes. For applied degree programmes, including the additional annual subsidies, the total annual subsidy amounts will also remain unchanged at $89,620 for laboratory-based programmes and $51,880 for non-laboratory-based programmes.

The subsidy amounts are applicable to both new and continuing eligible students. The subsidy is tenable for the normal duration of the programmes concerned. Subsidised students will pay a tuition fee with the subsidy applied. Students in need may still apply for student financial assistance from the Student Finance Office of the Working Family and Student Financial Assistance Agency in respect of the actual amount of tuition fee payable.

The subsidised FYFD intake places are allocated mainly through the Joint University Programmes Admissions System to ensure that eligible students are selected on a merit basis, whereas the subsidised places of the TUD programmes are allocated in accordance with the existing admission arrangements of the self-financing TUD programmes, i.e. through direct admission by institutions. Students can apply for admission to the programmes directly through the institutions concerned.

The SSSDP was launched in the 2015/16 academic year to subsidise students to pursue designated full-time locally accredited self-financing undergraduate programmes in selected disciplines. The objectives are as follows:

(1) to increase the supply of subsidised undergraduate places by leveraging the supply of the self-financing post-secondary education sector;

(2) to nurture talent in support of specific industries with keen demand for human resources;

(3) to encourage the self-financing post-secondary education sector to offer programmes in selected disciplines that meet Hong Kong's social and economic needs by providing targeted financial support; and

(4) to support the healthy and sustainable development of the self-financing post-secondary education sector to complement the University Grants Committee-funded sector in broadening and diversifying study opportunities.

The SSSDP has been expanded to include TUD programmes with effect from the 2023/24 academic year. As for the designated sub-degree programmes, the relevant details for the 2026/27 cohort, including the participating institutions, the sub-degree programmes, the numbers of subsidised places and the subsidy amounts, will be announced in due course.

Details of the SSSDP are available on the EDB website (www.cspe.edu.hk/sssdp)."
Ma Liu Shui New Ferry Pier opens today (with photo),2025-09-09 14:15,2025-09-09 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900292.htm,"Ma Liu Shui New Ferry Pier is open for public use today (September 9), providing two berths to divert vessel and passenger traffic from the existing Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier and the nearby landing steps, thereby alleviating congestion, especially during holidays.

The new pier, a project under the Pier Improvement Programme (PIP), is located next to Ma Liu Shui Landing No. 3 on Science Park Road in Sha Tin (see location map). It provides berths for local sightseeing vessels and kaito ferries for passenger boarding and alighting. Two regular kaito ferry service routes, namely Ma Liu Shui - Lai Chi Wo and Ma Liu Shui - Kat O/Ap Chau, currently using Landing No. 3 for boarding and alighting, will switch to the new pier starting this Saturday (September 13). The other two regular kaito ferry service routes, Ma Liu Shui - Tap Mun and Ma Liu Shui - Tung Ping Chau, will continue to use Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier.

The new pier features a design with a floating platform and a gangway. As the floating platform rises and falls with the sea level, it remains at the same level as the vessels, making it easier for them to berth and for passengers to board and alight safely and conveniently. The floating platform is connected to the shore by a gangway for passengers in need. In addition, facilities including charging stations, a Wi-Fi hotspot and an information display panel are installed on the shore to enhance user convenience and experience.

Launched in 2017, the PIP aims to improve marine traffic to and from remote areas in the New Territories and outlying islands, facilitating access for residents and visitors while meeting the needs of fishermen's operations through reconstruction or construction of public piers and upgrading of pier facilities. The PIP currently involves 23 public piers. In addition to Ma Liu Shui New Ferry Pier, which is open today, Pak Kok Pier on Lamma Island and Kau Sai Village Pier in Sai Kung are already open for public use. Ten piers are under construction, seven of which will open progressively by the end of 2025. These include Lai Chi Chong Pier, Sham Chung Pier and Sam Mun Tsai Village Pier in Tai Po District; Leung Shuen Wan Pier in Sai Kung District; Yi O Pier and Ma Wan Chung Pier on Lantau; and Shek Tsai Wan Pier at Ma Wan. Improvement works for Yung Shue Wan Public Pier on Lamma Island, Sai Wan Jetty on Cheung Chau and Tai O Public Pier on Lantau are expected to be completed in 2026. The remaining piers are at the planning and design stages, and the projects will be taken forward in an orderly manner."

新碼頭是「改善碼頭計劃」下的項目，位於沙田科學園路馬料水三號梯台旁（見位置圖），供本地觀光船隻和街渡渡輪停泊上落客。現時利用三號梯台上落客的兩條固定班次街渡渡輪服務航線：馬料水—荔枝窩和馬料水—吉澳／鴨洲，本周六（九月十三日）起將改用新碼頭上落客；而馬料水—塔門和馬料水—東平洲兩條固定班次街渡渡輪服務航線將繼續使用馬料水渡輪碼頭上落客。

新碼頭採用浮動平台及斜台設計。由於浮動平台會隨海面升降，能與船隻保持在同一水平，方便船隻靠泊，乘客上落船隻亦更加安全和便捷；浮動平台以斜台連接到岸上，供有需要乘客使用。此外，岸上配備充電設施、Wi-Fi熱點及電子顯示屏等，方便使用者及豐富其體驗。

政府於二○一七年推出「改善碼頭計劃」，透過重建或增建公共碼頭，以及提升碼頭設施，改善新界及離島偏遠地方的對外海上交通，方便居民和遊客出行及滿足漁民作業需要。計劃現時涵蓋二十三個公眾碼頭，除了今日開放的馬料水新渡輪碼頭，南丫島北角碼頭及西貢滘西村碼頭已經啓用；十個碼頭正在興建中，當中七個將於二○二五年年底前陸續啓用，分別為大埔區荔枝莊碼頭、深涌碼頭及三門仔村碼頭、西貢區糧船灣碼頭、大嶼山二澳碼頭及馬灣涌碼頭，以及馬灣石仔灣碼頭；而南丫島榕樹灣公眾碼頭、長洲西灣碼頭及大嶼山大澳公眾碼頭的改善工程則預計於二○二六年完成；其餘碼頭正在規劃及設計階段，會適時有序地推展。"

香港特區政府與貿易發展局主辦的第十屆「一帶一路高峰論壇」，將於本周三、四（九月十至十一日）在香港舉行。論壇匯聚多國政商界領袖，共同探討商機，是深化香港與「一帶一路」沿線國家和地區經貿聯繫的重要平台。適逢高峰論壇即將舉行，立法會秘書處（秘書處）今日（九月九日）發布最新一期《專題快訊》――「拓展全球經貿網絡」。

《專題快訊》概述香港在國家《十四五規劃》的支持下，發揮國際貿易中心角色的最新情況，包括香港在經貿方面的獨特優勢，以及如何發揮「超級連繫人」及「超級增值人」的角色，持續拓展經貿網絡，並綜述立法會相關討論。

《專題快訊》指出，香港憑藉自由貿易政策、世界級基礎設施、普通法制度和健全法治，以及「一國兩制」的制度優勢這四項「成功基因」，成為全球最具競爭力的貿易中心之一，香港特區政府亦一直多管齊下拓展全球經貿網絡。

《專題快訊》指出，香港積極擴展貿易及投資協定，與二十一個經濟體簽訂了自由貿易協定，以及與三十三個經濟體簽訂了促進和保護投資協定，與卡塔爾的投資協定談判亦大致完成。立法會議員建議政府尋求與更多經濟體，特別是東盟和中東新興市場，商定自貿和投資協定，以及協助港商開拓拉丁美洲市場。

《專題快訊》亦介紹，特區政府積極爭取加入全球規模最大的自貿協定《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP），以減少國際貿易成本和貿易壁壘，並指出香港加入RCEP後，將深化成員間的貿易往來，協助它們參與「一帶一路」倡議，助力進入內地市場。立法會亦積極爭取多方支持香港盡早加入RCEP，包括在立法會主席率領下先後到東盟三國（即馬來西亞、印尼和新加坡）及日本進行職務考察，並接待了多國的駐港總領事和國會議員，向他們解說香港加入RCEP有助促進互惠共贏。議員又建議政府規劃北部都會區時，重點推動可受惠於RCEP的相關配套產業。

《專題快訊》亦臚列特區政府多項招商引資的工作，包括致力構建跨國供應鏈管理中心，吸引內地企業來港設立管理離岸貿易和供應鏈的國際或區域總部，協助內地企業「走出去」；透過《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA），加大開拓內地貨物及服務貿易，增強香港對海外投資者的吸引力，同時讓香港成為內地企業「走出去」的最佳跳板，而去年簽訂的CEPA《服務貿易協議》的第二份修訂協議，讓香港的服務提供者更容易在內地設立企業和發展業務。

《專題快訊》指出，「一帶一路」倡議是格局宏大的國家長遠發展策略，香港憑藉獨特優勢成為共建「一帶一路」的首選功能平台，而特區政府積極拓展沿線新興巿場，近年重點工作包括行政長官訪問中東，加強與當地的經貿聯繫，擴展全球各地特別是新興市場的辦事處網絡，以及優化「BUD專項基金」，協助企業拓展境外市場。

《專題快訊》綜述議員對拓展全球經貿網絡的多項建議，包括建議當局全面統籌和加強招商引資工作，檢視和優化相關部門和公營機構的分工及職能，避免資源重疊；建立健全產業鏈和供應鏈，協助企業「引進來、走出去」；在更多領域訂立及推廣粵港澳大灣區標準，以便利港商利用CEPA的優惠措施進入內地市場；推動本地航空公司開辦更多來往香港與中東城市的國際航線，以便利經商旅遊，以及吸引「一帶一路」沿線國家企業和家族辦公室來港開設或擴展業務。

財經事務及庫務局局長在蘇州（香港）金融合作交流會致辭全文（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-09 13:00,2025-09-09 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900396.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（九月九日）在蘇州（香港）金融合作交流會的致辭全文：

尊敬的林太（香港特別行政區第五任行政長官、江蘇省海外聯誼會名譽會長、江蘇省香港商會永遠榮譽會長林鄭月娥）、馬省長（江蘇省常務副省長馬欣）、顧市長（蘇州市常務副市長顧海東）、彩霞巡視員（國家金融監督管理總局國際合作司一級巡視員王彩霞）、各位重要嘉賓、金融業界朋友：

大家好。歡迎馬省長和顧市長帶領各位蘇州市的同事來到香港。很高興今天出席蘇州金融合作交流推介會，與各位就促進蘇州和香港金融合作交流，並見證《香港──蘇州金融協同發展行動方案》的簽署。

香港是蘇州市主要外資來源地。去年蘇州實際使用港資接近30億美元，佔全市實際使用外資額約百分之五十七。今年蘇州市政府工作報告強調要提升蘇州對外開放水平，主動擁抱全球化，着力打造雙向開放的國際門戶城市。在此基礎上，我認為香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，正好可發揮作為國際金融中心的優勢，透過加強香港蘇州兩地的金融合作，達致互利共贏。合作方向我這裏也拋磚引玉提出四個可行的範疇。

第一，善用香港作為聯通內地與世界各地的「超級聯繫人」角色，助力蘇州企業拓展國際業務。香港擁有國際級一流的專業服務和豐富的國際交流合作經驗，是蘇州企業「走出去」，拓展「一帶一路」及海外市場的首選平台。無論是為大型基建項目融資、設立企業的離岸財資中心，還是設立專屬自保保險公司等，香港都能提供全面的專業服務，充分發揮既了解內地企業需求，又與國際市場接軌的優勢。

第二，深化資本市場聯通。在上市融資方面，香港一直擔當內地企業集資平台的角色。截至今年七月底，在香港上市的內地企業共有1 511家，當中有五家市值合共約900多億港元的蘇州企業。我們歡迎更多蘇州企業善用香港作為籌融資平台，包括透過香港交易所（香港交易及結算所有限公司）於前年推出的特專科技上市新章節上市融資。

第三，支持數字金融和金融科技創新。科技自立自強是國家強盛之基、安全之要，科技創新已經成為提高綜合國力的關鍵支撐。在金融領域，香港目前共有超過1 100家金融科技公司，涵蓋移動支付、跨境理財、人工智能金融服務顧問、財富及投資管理、合規科技等範疇。蘇州香港兩地金融機構和企業可以加強在金融科技技術研發和應用方面的合作。

第四，推動綠色金融發展。綠色金融對推動經濟社會可持續發展、實現雙碳目標有重要意義。香港可以進一步發揮國際金融中心的優勢，引導境外資金支持國家綠色和可持續發展。我們也知道今年剛好是「兩山」理念的二十周年慶典，所以這個綠色金融發展正好是非常好的時機，我們期待香港和蘇州加強綠色金融方面的交流合作，也歡迎蘇州政府和企業善用香港進行綠色融資，包括發行綠色債券。

女士們先生們，今日《香港──蘇州金融協同發展行動方案》的簽署，正好體現了剛才我提及的四大合作範疇。我期待未來與蘇州市政府進一步加強合作交流，實現互惠共贏，共同為國家金融高質量發展作出積極貢獻。謝謝。"

Speech by FS at AVPN Global Conference 2025 (English only) (with photos/video),2025-09-09 12:18,2025-09-09 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900388.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the AVPN Global Conference 2025 today (September 9):

Ms Batra (Chief Executive Officer of AVPN, Ms Naina Batra), Winfried (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC), Mr Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning.

  On behalf of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to you all.

  The AVPN conference brings together some of the most influential minds in philanthropy, family offices and impact investing. I would like to express my sincere thanks to AVPN and the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust for hosting this impactful event right here in Hong Kong.

  You are here because you all recognise a profound shift in the global investment narrative. You are here because you know the importance of forging partnerships and breaking silos. And you are here because Hong Kong stands as a global centre and a strategic hub for philanthropy, sustainable finance and impact investing.

  Today marks Day 2 of Hong Kong Green Week, and I’m delighted that impact investing is front and centre. This is an area that Hong Kong has made significant strides in recent years. As a global financial and business centre, and the gateway connecting the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world, we have been doing well, particularly for the financial markets over the past year or so. But we know that doing well alone is no longer enough. The imperative of our time is clear: we must do good while doing well.

The Asian opportunity

  Indeed, Asia presents both an enormous need, and a tremendous opportunity, for impact investing.

  To put it into perspective: Asia is home to around 60 per cent of the world’s population and is undergoing an unprecedented economic transformation. Yet, the region is also highly vulnerable to natural disasters. In 2022, for example, 140 disasters struck this continent, resulting in economic damage equivalent to the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of Myanmar.

  The UN (United Nations) has estimated that Asia requires around US$1.5 trillion in annual investments to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Apparently, the gap between need and available private capital is vast.

  Globally, the impact investing market has expanded rapidly, with AUM (assets under management) reaching US$1.6 trillion in 2024, more than double the total in 2020. The amount is projected to reach US$6 trillion by 2031. Yet, capital allocation for impact investing remains uneven. Studies show that North America accounts for 47 per cent, Europe 23 per cent, while South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia combined account for less than 15 per cent.

  But within this gap lies hope and immense potential. Asia is home to a fast-growing generation of wealth holders. According to market analysis, the region counted over 850 000 high-net-worth individuals in 2024. Many are not just wealthy entrepreneurs or heirs to fortunes. They are impact-minded leaders who seek to define their legacy through positive social and environmental change.

  With these trends and challenges, the key question is: How can we better connect opportunities with capital where it is needed most?

Hong Kong: a platform for purposeful capital

  This is exactly where Hong Kong comes in.

  Hong Kong has always been a super connector. A conduit for global capital and a value adder. We are built for this.

  Our world-class financial and legal systems as well as top-notch professional services are underpinned by the “one country, two systems” framework. We consistently rank among the world’s top cities, from business competitiveness to economic freedom, and from innovation prowess to talent quality. These make us uniquely positioned to serve as a launch pad for purpose-driven investments.

  For philanthropists and social businesses, Hong Kong offers access to global networks and best practices, institutions and talent, and a diverse pool of impact-first capital.

  One example is the Impact Link, launched by the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy last year. This platform connects donors and family offices with high-impact charitable initiatives, matching capital with projects of worthy causes. Our city is also home to a vibrant network of charitable organisations, NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and international foundations. They, of course, include the HKJC Charities Trust, which may well be Hong Kong’s largest charity donor.

  In fact, over the past three years, tax deductible charitable donations made by individuals and businesses stood at about HK$40 billion.

  We are magnifying this impact through proactive policies, such as providing tax concessions and attracting more family offices which are forces for good. And our policy statement for developing family offices offers a clear roadmap to support the growth of family offices.

  Our ESG (environmental, social and governance) and green finance ecosystem is one of the most vibrant in Asia. In 2024, Hong Kong issued over US$80 billion in sustainable debt, with green bonds making up 45 per cent of the regional total. Today, more than 200 ESG funds are authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission with a combined AUM exceeding US$140 billion.

  We are also innovating. From tokenised green bonds to more thematic ESG ETFs (exchange traded funds), we are expanding the suite of financial instruments and product offerings.

  Beyond finance, the Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, is fast rising as the world’s leading innovation cluster. Start-ups here are developing transformative solutions, ranging from AI-powered greentech to medtech and inclusive fintech, all designed to solve real-world problems and promote equitable development.

  Indeed, across the Chinese Mainland and Asia, a new wave of innovation is emerging, brimming with tech start-ups and enterprises. They are offering scalable, tech-enabled solutions to address our most pressing challenges like climate change.

  With these advantages, Hong Kong is keen to create a seamless ecosystem where capital can be efficiently structured, deployed and scaled for maximum sustainable impact, both within our region and across the globe.

  At our core, Hong Kong believes in collaboration. We are committed to building strong, cross-sector partnerships that create value for all.

Step forward: showcasing our capability

  In this connection, understanding how to mobilise impact capital effectively is crucial. I am pleased to note that tomorrow, our Financial Services Development Council will launch a special report right here at this conference.

  That report will highlight real-world case studies that showcase how Hong Kong is already serving as a powerful agent in mobilising impact capital. I hope you will find inspiration and actionable insight in its pages. 

Conclusion

  Ladies and gentlemen, we live in uncertain times. But gatherings like this one give me tremendous hope. 

  You are the change makers, the architects of a more inclusive and sustainable future. And Hong Kong is your committed partner. We are ready, willing and uniquely positioned to help you channel capital for purpose, connect ambition with action, and turn the vision of doing good into a reality that changes lives.

  Enjoy the rich discussions over the next few days. Let us learn from one another, forge new partnerships, and leave here ready to build a better world, together. Thank you."
Another trial project on hydrogen fuel technology given agreement-in-principle by Inter-departmental Working Group on Using Hydrogen as Fuel,2025-09-09 12:00,2025-09-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900267.htm,"  The Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) announced today (September 9) that the Inter-departmental Working Group on Using Hydrogen as Fuel has given agreement-in-principle to another application of a trial project on hydrogen fuel technology.

  The said project concerns an application of a trial project submitted by the Bibicar International Trade Co., Limited, involving the display of 30 hydrogen fuel cell goods vehicles at a site in Yuen Long and the operation of such vehicles between the site and the Au Tau hydrogen refuelling station for test driving, hydrogen refuelling and sales purposes.

  To date, the Working Group has given agreement-in-principle in stages to a total of 28 applications of hydrogen energy trial projects. The Working Group will continue to make reference to the operational data and experience collected from the trials to provide advice for the continuous enhancement of the safety and technical guidelines on the local application of hydrogen energy. Details are set out in the thematic webpage (cnsd.gov.hk/en/inter-departmental-working-group-on-using-hydrogen-as-fuel/).

  The Working Group is formed by the EEB, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Security Bureau, the Environmental Protection Department, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, the Fire Services Department, the Transport Department, the Marine Department, the Planning Department, the Lands Department, the Buildings Department, the Architectural Services Department and the Labour Department."

Handle unlicensed vehicles properly in timely manner to avoid prosecutions following new vehicle licensing regulation taking effect on December 22,2025-09-09 11:50,2025-09-09 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090400353.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (September 9) said that the new vehicle registration and licensing regime will take effect on December 22 to strengthen regulations on prolonged unlicensed vehicles. Under the new regime, unlicensed vehicles will remain registered under the name of owners, who will continue to be held responsible for their vehicles. A new offence will also be introduced to heighten deterrence against improper abandoning of vehicles for addressing the problem at the source.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""Starting from December 22, we will issue a notice to registered owners of vehicles unlicensed for two years or more. Vehicle owners must, within three months of the date of notice, renew the licence, or cancel the registration of such vehicles with the TD after scrapping them or permanently shipping them out of Hong Kong. They should handle their vehicles properly and in a timely manner to avoid contravening the law.""

  Failing to take action upon expiry of the three-month notice period will constitute an offence. The maximum penalty for the first conviction will be a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months. For each subsequent conviction, the maximum penalty will be a $25,000 fine and six months' imprisonment. Unless the fine is paid, the TD may, subject to the court's order, (1) refuse to issue or renew the driving licence of a convicted vehicle owner; (2) take no action on any application for transfer of ownership of the subject vehicle; and (3) refuse to issue a vehicle licence to the subject vehicle or any other vehicles under the convicted owner's name.

  Individual vehicle owners who have a genuine difficulty in taking the required actions within the three-month notice period or have reasonable grounds for not licensing their vehicles may apply for an exemption from the TD. In general, exemptions may be granted under the following three scenarios: (1) vehicles pending spare parts for maintenance and examination before licence renewal; (2) vehicles manufactured for 30 years or more, properly stored as a private collection and not used on roads; or (3) vehicles properly stored by a car dealer and consigned for sale. Vehicle owners may provide other reasonable grounds for the TD's consideration of granting an exemption based on individual cases. The eligibility criteria and guidelines for exemption will be announced later.

  The spokesman reminded vehicle owners that, even when a vehicle remains unlicensed or is granted an exemption, it will remain registered under their name and they have to continue to bear all legal liabilities associated with it. Since December 2024 the TD has started issuing SMS messages or emails to registered owners whose vehicle licences will expire in one month, have just expired or have expired for two years via the e-contact means they provided in their licensing applications, to remind them that they must renew their vehicle licence or properly handle their vehicles in time.

  The TD has also stepped up publicity and public education to remind vehicle owners to take action early for vehicles unlicensed for two years or more. Vehicle owners may make use of the e-Licensing Portal to check the vehicle licence expiry date, handle licensing matters and take proper action on their unlicensed vehicles. Members of the public may refer to the TD's website for details, or call the hotline at 2804 2600 for enquiries."
車輛領牌新規例十二月二十二日實施　及時妥善處理未領牌車輛免被檢控,2025-09-09 11:50,2025-09-09 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090400327.htm,"運輸署今日（九月九日）表示，將於十二月二十二日實施新的車輛登記及領牌制度，加強規管長期未領牌的車輛。在新制度下，未領牌車輛將一直登記在車主名下，車主須為其車輛負上責任。新規例同時引入新罪行以提高阻嚇力，從源頭解決不當棄置車輛的問題。

運輸署發言人說：「由十二月二十二日起，署方將向兩年或以上未領牌車輛的登記車主發出通知書，要求車主必須在發出通知書日期的三個月內為車輛領牌，或把車輛拆毀或永久送離香港後向署方取消登記。車主須及時妥善處理車輛，以免觸犯法例。」

如車主在該三個月通知期屆滿前仍不採取行動，即屬犯罪。首次定罪最高可罰款10,000元和監禁三個月；其後每次定罪最高可罰款25,000元和監禁六個月。除非已繳付罰款，否則運輸署可根據法庭命令：（一）拒絕向被定罪車主發出或續發駕駛執照；（二）不處理涉事車輛的過戶申請；及（三）拒絕向涉事車輛或被定罪車主名下其他車輛發出車輛牌照。

商務及經濟發展局局長在海南自貿港推介暨政策解讀會致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-09-09 11:18,2025-09-09 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900350.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（九月九日）在海南自貿港推介暨政策解讀會的致辭全文：

尊敬的馮飛書記（海南省委書記）、尹宗華副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李永勝副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好，今天很高興出席海南省在香港舉辦的海南自貿港推介暨政策解讀會，首先我謹代表特區政府歡迎馮書記率團訪問香港。

海南與香港地緣相近，人員互動、物流和資金流的往來都十分頻繁。香港是海南最主要的外資來源地，不少香港企業在海南開展業務。單單是去年，海南新成立的香港企業就有700多家，實際利用香港直接投資的金額超過150億人民幣，增幅超過9%。

港商在海南的投資十分廣泛，涵蓋了商業地產、醫療健康、旅遊零售等多個領域，瓊港合作近年更上一層樓，擴展到金融合作、專業資格認證、青年創業等不同領域。同時，海南近年也積極投資香港，連續三年在香港發行離岸人民幣債券，海南省更是內地第一個使用香港融資平台和專業服務發債的省份。

特區政府非常重視瓊港兩地的合作交流。今年三月，在行政長官訪問海南期間，與馮書記一同見證了特區政府和海南省簽署的一系列加強雙邊合作的備忘錄，涵蓋經貿投資、金融、數據安全流動、旅遊，以及人才交流等五個領域，推動海南自貿港構建，同時也為香港的專業服務和資本提供更廣闊的發展空間，實現香港與海南省企業一同拼船出海，全面發揮瓊港兩地的優勢，一同走向世界市場。

海南自貿港的建設將於今年十二月十八日正式啓動，迎來歷史一刻，一系列自由便利的進出措施，將擴大海南對外開放的水平，助力加強包括人流、物流和資金流等要素在海南自由流通。海南省這次在香港舉辦的政策解讀會正逢其時，加深香港企業對海南自貿港發展的了解，同時推動更廣、更深、更高水平的交流合作，共同發展新質生產力。

在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，特區政府會全力發揮好香港作為「超級連繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，發揮香港所長，促進粵港澳大灣區與海南自貿港的聯動發展，同時引入國際項目到海南、服務海南資金投資海外市場，與海南創造更多互利共贏的合作，共同為國家的高質量發展和提升經濟動能作出貢獻。

謝謝。"
Speech by CE at HK-Asean Summit 2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-09-09 11:18,2025-09-09 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900325.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the HK-Asean Summit 2025 today (September 9):

Honourable Minister Anthony (Minister of Transport of Malaysia, Mr Loke Siew Fook), Secretary Rodolfo (Undersecretary for the Industry Development Group of the Department of Trade and Industry of Philippines, Dr Ceferino Rodolfo), Ms Catherine So (Chief Executive Officer of the South China Morning Post),Dr Daryl Ng (Chairman of the Hong Kong-ASEAN Foundation), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am very delighted to join you today at the 2025 Hong Kong-Asean Summit.

  This is, I'm pleased to say, the fourth consecutive year I've addressed this Summit, an annual event created to put a bright spotlight on the dynamic and mutually rewarding ties between Hong Kong and ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

  Allow me first to welcome Minister Loke, our good friend from Malaysia, together with many other senior government officials, business leaders and distinguished guests from ASEAN and beyond.

  Indeed, some 400 of you are here today, with another 300 or so taking in this year's Summit virtually, and you'll be hearing from 20 prominent speakers from some 30 countries and regions. Your presence underscores the enduring strength of our partnership, and shared commitment, to enhancing regional development and prosperity.

  There are good reasons for our partnership. The recent rise of protectionism and unilateralism is creating significant uncertainties in international trade, damaging trading systems and escalating geopolitical risks.

  In such trying times, it is all the more important for like-minded economies to work together, upholding multilateralism with an open, rules-based order. Hong Kong has long been a free port and a champion of multilateral trade. That's why we attach great importance to our relations with ASEAN, whose 10 member states share similar values and a clear commitment to promoting free and open trade.

  And that's why the ASEAN region was the destination of my first overseas visit, after assuming office some three years ago. Over the years, I'm glad to have led high-level business delegations from Hong Kong to visit seven different ASEAN countries, concluding some 90 documents of co-operation on various fronts.

   ASEAN, after all, is the third-most populous region and fifth-largest economy in the world.

  For 15 years in a row, ASEAN has been Hong Kong's second-largest merchandise trading partner. Last year, our trade was valued at more than US$165 billion, up almost 15 per cent over the previous year.

  And our merchandise trade in the first half of this year continued to soar, I'm delighted to note, rising nearly one quarter. Our services trade is equally cheering, climbing about 30 per cent, year-on-year, and reaching US$18 billion in 2023, making ASEAN our third-largest services trading partner.

  We like to invest in each other's opportunities, too. ASEAN is Hong Kong's third-largest outward investment destination, and sixth-largest source of inward direct investment.

  More than our long years of friendship, the robust relationship between us is backed by the ASEAN-Hong Kong, China Free Trade Agreement and its related Investment Agreement. They have been in full force since 2021, with the linked Economic and Technical Co-operation Work Programme focused on ensuring continuing trade and investment growth.

  Last year, the number of offices set up in Hong Kong with parent companies located in ASEAN grew 13 per cent. Some 730 ASEAN companies now call Hong Kong home.

  There are plenty of good reasons for ASEAN companies to look to Hong Kong for their future. Long the world's freest economy, Hong Kong was also the world's seventh-largest merchandise trading entity last year.

  This year, the International Institute for Management Development's World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Hong Kong third, globally, in competitiveness. That is the second year, in a row, that we've gone up two places in this ranking, and our first return to the global top three since 2019.

  More good news. Just this morning, the Institute released its annual World Talent Ranking, in which Hong Kong's ranking rose to fourth, globally, and first in the Asia Pacific. This is our highest-ever position in the ranking, having climbed up five places from last year. Indeed, our ranking rose 12 places over the past two years, a clear testament to the HKSAR Government's enhanced efforts in education and talent development.

  The World Talent Ranking, I'm pleased to add, recognises Hong Kong's outstanding academic achievement, ranking us first in the indicator ""Graduates in Sciences"".

  Yes, Hong Kong is the only city in the globe with as many as five universities in the world's top 100. Our excellent institutions nurture world-class scientists and research talent in different disciplines.

  Leveraging that strength, Hong Kong is fast rising as an innovation and technology hub. Earlier this month, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster topped the world - for the first time - in the World Intellectual Property Organization's annual Global Innovation Index.

  All three cities in the cluster are core cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a cluster city development that brings together a population of 87 million.

  By synergising Hong Kong's research prowess with the Mainland's innovation and manufacturing capabilities, we are committed to becoming one of the world's leading I&T centres.

  And, as one of the world's top three international financial centres, Hong Kong has the liquidity, along with the angel investors, venture capital and private equity funds, to drive innovation and innovative companies. These, ladies and gentlemen, present far-reaching opportunities for ASEAN companies and entrepreneurs looking to tap into the vast and promising markets of the Mainland.

  And we are continually seeking to expand our co-operation and ties. In addition to our Economic and Trade Offices in Singapore, Jakarta and Bangkok, we are working closely with the Malaysian Government to open a fourth ASEAN-based Office in Kuala Lumpur.

  I am pleased to note that excellent progress has been made towards establishing this new office, and I am sure our ties with ASEAN will reach another level entirely with the new addition.

  Then there's the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade bloc. The theme of this year's Summit, ""Bridging Horizons, Building Futures"", seems to me to speak to the value and contributions Hong Kong will add to the Partnership with our accession.

  That includes serving as a multilevel bridge between the Chinese Mainland and ASEAN. Ladies and gentlemen, I count on your continuing support in realising Hong Kong's bid for accession.

  Trade and investment aside, we enjoy close people-to-people ties and exchanges. We have relaxed the criteria for nationals of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam in applying for multi-entry visas for travel and business. And we have extended their validity period from two to three years.

  We are, as well, providing self-service immigration clearance for invited visitors participating in business, development and related activities from all ASEAN countries.

  Those ""related activities"" include enjoying the world-class arts, culture and entertainment, everywhere you turn, in Hong Kong, a world city rising as the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. Sports exchange and excitement, too, thanks to our world-class facilities, including new, state-of-the-art Kai Tak Sports Park. Or a fond exchange with our six cuddly giant pandas, right here in Ocean Park.

  Before I go, allow me to mention that Hong Kong's Belt and Road Summit, the 10th anniversary edition, opens tomorrow. The annual event attracts government officials and business leaders and investors from Hong Kong, the Mainland and throughout the region, including those from ASEAN states.

  Hong Kong, of course, plays a key role in our country's Belt and Road Initiative. It's part of our continuing contribution to regional connectivity. I look forward to seeing you there.

  Because we believe in partnership. Despite all the uncertainties and unease across the globe, Hong Kong holds on to the belief that free trade is the backbone for boosting global output. It's the key ingredient for a more interconnected, peaceful and productive world economy.

  As Hong Kong and ASEAN deepen our collaboration, we are paving the way for stronger economic partnerships and enhanced regional connectivity, creating opportunities for shared growth and prosperity. Together, we are not afraid of storms. United, we will sail our ships, through thick and thin, whether it is Typhoon Nine, Typhoon Eight, or Typhoon Eight-Goodbye.

  In closing, my thanks to the South China Morning Post for once again hosting this significant annual gathering, made for business, for networking, for creating partnerships and enduring co-operation. And that, ladies and gentlemen, will ensure that today's trying times soon give way to inspiring times. Rewarding times for us all.

  I wish you the best of business and a memorable stay in Hong Kong.

  Thank you."

å°æ¬çæä¸»ä»» (CPC Committee Member and Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Mr Li Zhen)ãChairman Gao (Chairman of GTI, Mr Gao Tongqing), Chairman Ehrlich (Chairman of GTI, Mr Craig Ehrlich), Mr Li (Executive Vice President of China Mobile, Mr Li Huidi), Professor Chao (Vice President (Research and Innovation) of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Professor Christopher Chao), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning! It is my great pleasure to speak again at the GTI Forum on Digital Intelligence · Hong Kong. For those who are visiting Hong Kong for the first time, a big welcome to Hong Kong, and I wish you a pleasant stay to explore the wonders of this vibrant city.

  The recent announcement by the World Intellectual Property Organization ranking the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster as number one in its index of the world's top 100 innovation clusters in the Global Innovation Index 2025 is a resounding affirmation of our region's visionary commitment to innovation and technology (I&T). This recognition not only celebrates our collective achievements, but also reinforces Hong Kong's strategic position in the global I&T landscape.
 
  Thanks to GTI, who have chosen Hong Kong to host the forum for two consecutive years. This reflects not only GTI's recognition of Hong Kong's crucial role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"", but also the confidence that you have placed in Hong Kong as a promising, global hub of I&T.

  Among the many emerging technologies in this I&T era, artificial intelligence (AI) has been at its forefront in recent years. The focus of the GTI Forum is no exception, as evidenced from the forum programme, which will take us through the development, opportunities and challenges of AI in the coming two days.

  Recognising the great potential of AI, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government has introduced a number of initiatives to support and drive the local AI ecosystem. On digital infrastructure, our local I&T flagship Cyberport has commenced operation of its AI Supercomputing Centre (AISC) since last December to advance AI research and applications. Its computing power will ramp up within this year. Leveraging the AISC, we also provide subsidies to its eligible users, such as local institutions, research and development (R&D) centres, enterprises and start-ups through the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme to encourage the R&D of potential groundbreaking AI.

  Another initiative spearheaded by the Hong Kong SAR Government to support AI R&D is the AIR@InnoHK Research Cluster. It is a collaboration with leading R&D institutions locally and globally, that drives advancements in AI and robotics technologies. The cluster has set up 15 R&D labs, including the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center, HKGAI in short. In this February, the HKGAI launched its homegrown AI large language model, and integrated it into a generative AI document processing copilot application (HKPilot). The AI copilot application has been widely adopted for trial use within the Government in respect of drafting, translation and summarising of documents.

  In addition, we have further earmarked $1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI R&D Institute. This new institute, which is targeted to be set up in 2026, will spearhead AI development and industry applications in Hong Kong, as well as to facilitate upstream R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes and expand application scenarios.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the above are just a few examples of our I&T initiatives to foster a vibrant local AI ecosystem. I am confident that with the concerted efforts of the Government, industry, academia, research institutes and investment sectors, our AI ecosystem will thrive and bring promising opportunities to Hong Kong, Mainland China and the world.

  Before I close, may I wish the GTI Forum another year of great success and everyone a rewarding journey. Thank you."

香港在《排名》中所有三個人才競爭力因素均連續第二年上升。其中，「吸引力」排名攀升八位至第二十；「就緒度」及「投資及發展」的排名均上升一名，分別位列第三及第十二。各項指標方面，香港的科學學科畢業生百分比繼續高踞全球第一，財務技能排名上升至全球第三，而管理層薪酬和管理教育效能均位列全球第五。

政府發言人表示：「香港在國際管理發展學院發布的《排名》位列亞洲第一，證明香港特別行政區（特區）政府在教育、創新科技及引進人才方面的政策措施找對路向和收到成效。香港專上教育高度國際化和多元化，擁有五所世界百強大學，優秀的科研人才，是國際高端人才交流合作的匯聚地。政府致力打造『留學香港』品牌，持續堅定投資教育，支持院校不斷革新優化，發揮一流大學優勢，配合院校擴容提質，又推行獎學金計劃等一系列具體政策措施，全方位吸引各地優秀人才和培育本地人才，鞏固香港國際專上教育樞紐的地位，配合教育強國戰略。

特區政府深明人才在科技等發展的關鍵作用，在二○二四年的《施政報告》宣布成立教育、科技和人才委員會，由政務司司長領導統籌推進教育、科技和人才一體化融合發展，制訂政策推動育才、匯才、科技協同發展，同時推動國際高端人才集聚香港。世界知識產權組織於九月一日公布的《2025年全球創新指數》百強創新集群，「深圳—香港—廣州」集群亦首度排名全球第一，足見粵港澳大灣區在創科方面獲得國際的高度肯定，是全球各地創科人才開拓和發展事業的理想之地。」

發言人指：「本屆政府招攬人才措施效益顯著。我們會繼續對準香港『八大中心』戰略定位的人力需求，適時作出優化，加強培育本地相關人才，同時進一步提升人才庫的多元性及人才計劃的成效，為香港未來發展提供更強大的人才支撐。截至今年八月底，各項輸入人才計劃共收到逾52萬宗申請，其中超過35萬宗獲批，同期經各項人才入境計劃抵港的人才超過23萬人。我們歡迎外來的優秀人才及其家人持續落戶香港，充實我們的勞動力，有效優化我們的人口結構及填補人力資源的缺口，為本港經濟增長提供源源不絕的動力。」"
Hong Kong leaps to fourth place and ranks first in Asia in World Talent Ranking 2025,2025-09-09 09:40,2025-09-09 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090800827.htm,"The International Institute for Management Development (IMD) published the World Talent Ranking 2025 today (September 9). Hong Kong's ranking leapt markedly to fourth globally from ninth last year, marking the highest-ever ranking and ranking first in Asia.

  For the second consecutive year, Hong Kong improved across all three ranked talent competitiveness factors. Hong Kong's ranking rose by eight places to 20th in ""Appeal"", and by one place for both ""Readiness"" and ""Investment and Development"" to third and 12th respectively. Among the indicators, Hong Kong continued to top the ranking in the percentage of graduates in sciences. The city rose to third in the availability of finance skills, and ranked fifth in the remuneration of management as well as effectiveness of management education.

A Government spokesman said, ""Hong Kong ranking first in Asia in the IMD's World Talent Ranking is clear evidence that the policies and measures of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in education, innovation and technology (I&T), and talent admission have found the right direction and are getting results. Hong Kong's post-secondary education is highly internationalised and diversified. The city boasts five of the world's top 100 universities with outstanding research talent, making it an international hub for exchanges and collaboration among high-calibre talent. The Government strives to establish the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand and stays committed to investing in education. Its unwavering support for institutions' continuous innovation and optimisation helps give full play to the strengths of first-class universities, and ties in with the institutions' capacity expansion and quality enhancement. The Government has also introduced a series of specific policies and measures such as scholarship programmes to attract quality talent from around the world and nurture local talent, with a view to consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international post-secondary education hub, and aligning with the national strategy of becoming a leading country in education.""

The HKSAR Government fully understands the vital role of talent in technology and other developments, and announced in the 2024 Policy Address the establishment of the Committee on Education, Technology and Talents, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, to co-ordinate and drive the integrated development of education, technology and talent, and to formulate policies to attract and cultivate talent, foster the development of technologies, as well as to promote Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent. In The World Intellectual Property Organization's Global Innovation Index (GII) 2025 top 100 innovation clusters published on September 1, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster came first globally for the first time, which reflects the high international recognition of the I&T capacity of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, reflecting that it is an ideal place for global I&T talent from around the world to develop and grow their careers.

The spokesman said, ""The talent attraction measures of the current-term Government are effective. We will continue to target the manpower demand of Hong Kong's strategic positioning of ""eight centres"" and refine the measures in a timely manner, enhance training of relevant local talent, and at the same time further enhance the diversity of the talent pool and effectiveness of the talent attraction measures to strengthen the talent support for the future development of Hong Kong. As at end-August this year, over 520 000 applications were received under various talent admission schemes, with over 350000 applications approved. Over 230 000 people of talent arrived in Hong Kong through various talent admission schemes over the same period. We welcome the continued arrival of outside quality talent and their family members to boost Hong Kong's labour force, effectively enhance our population structure, replenish the manpower shortfall and inject continuous impetus to Hong Kong's economic growth."""

  ""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 178 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 31 to September 6), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 225 cases (August 24 to 30) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are still experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and

周和副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室社會工作部副部長）、葛珮帆主席（智慧城市聯盟督導委員會主席、大灣區低空經濟聯盟創會會長）、楊文銳會長（智慧城市聯盟會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家午安！很高興出席智慧城市聯盟成立十周年暨大灣區低空經濟聯盟成立一周年的慶祝酒會。首先，讓我們一起向兩個聯盟表示最熱烈的祝賀！

過去幾年，在政府與各界的共同努力下，香港在智慧城市建設方面取得了不少扎實的進展。從金融科技到便捷出行，從環境監測到智慧政府，科技正全方位融入我們的生活。它提升了市民的生活質素，也改變了城市的面貌。

十年來，智慧城市聯盟積極建言獻策，匯聚業界和學界等多方力量和資源，推動人才培育、促進公私營協作，為香港的創科發展注入了更多新動能。而大灣區低空經濟聯盟的成立，更是在這個基礎上，推動香港和大灣區在低空經濟領域的協作和發展，為區域融合開創新維度。我對兩個聯盟一直以來的勤奮耕耘和貢獻，表示衷心的感謝！

當前，人工智能正以前所未有的速度驅動科技變革，引領智慧城市進入新的發展階段。香港作為國際金融、貿易和航運中心，正積極把握這一趨勢，全力推進智慧城市建設。這不僅可提升我們國際大都會的競爭力和吸引力，更與香港國際創科中心建設的定位相輔相成。

今日，我想就特區政府智慧城市發展策略中的兩點，即數據與人工智能扼要談談。

第一是數據的運用，即如何讓數據更深度接入生活的各個層面，讓它的價值更全面、更高效的釋放出來。我們的策略圍繞三個關鍵詞：開放、應用和互通。

開放數據，就是為社會各行各業提供智慧轉型的原材料。我們目前提供超過5 600個數據集，年度下載量已經突破600億次。由發展局開發的一站式空間數據共享平台就是其中一個例子，它在三年前開始啓用，以可視化地圖方式，提供規劃、地政、屋宇、交通、人口、工程等不同範疇的數據，去年數據的下載量超過122萬次，是二○二三年的四倍。這個項目也一直獲得智慧城市聯盟的積極支持。

未來，我們會適時、適度進一步擴大數據開放的範圍。

數據應用方面，特區政府除了在城市管理、交通、環境、社福等方面更廣泛應用數據以支持決策和進行規劃，也希望通過共享數據讓公私營的服務可以更便捷和普惠包容。香港金融管理局推出的商業數據通就是成功案例，讓中小企將其業務數據與銀行分享，便利其融資。自二○二二年推出至今年六月，商業數據通已協助處理超過61 000 宗貸款申請，總額超過500億港元。這個平台更已與政府授權數據交換閘對接，以涵蓋公司註冊處及土地註冊處的數據。根據現有數據的覆蓋範圍，約15萬間本港中小企可受惠於這個平台。

以上的例子自然地把我們帶到數據互通這議題上。事實上，數據互通有助推動低空經濟的發展。我們正研究建立低空飛行三維資訊樞紐，它將銜接空間數據共享平台，通過多元數據的整合，促進跨界別應用。

數據互通還有跨境的面向。在「一國兩制」下，香港同時匯聚內地和國際數據，是我們推動智慧城市發展的獨特優勢，對香港在人工智能、大數據和醫藥產業領域的研究和發展，也有很大的促進作用。在中央相關部委支持下，我們前年已與廣東省制定《大灣區標準合同》（《粵港澳大灣區（內地、香港）個人信息跨境流動標準合同》），促進兩地數據的安全流通。與此同時，我們亦正在河套深港創科園，推動數據以及資金、人才和其他生產要素自由流動的政策。

至於第二點——人工智能（AI）是不得不提的。AI正改變世界，它與各產業深度融合，大大提升生產力、改變產業模式，以及人們消費出行的模式，正深刻重塑企業之間、不同經濟體之間的競爭力，同時也為城市發展帶來質變和量變。AI應用可以減低能源消耗，也可以提供更高效和個性化的服務，這些只是眾多應用場景的實例。特區政府將AI定為核心產業，從算法、算力、數據、資金和人才等五方面加速推動其發展，促進其技術研發與應用，讓AI更廣泛賦能城市運作，提升市民生活質素。

可以預見，數據和人工智能的結合，將開創更多智慧應用場景，為各行各業帶來新動能、新機遇。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，智慧城市聯盟和大灣區低空經濟聯盟自成立以來，一直是特區政府的緊密夥伴。未來，我期待你們在以下三方面進一步助力香港的智慧城市建設。一是鼓勵創新科技的研發與應用，開拓更多應用場景；二是推動政、產、學、研、投全鏈條與城市發展的更緊密結合；三是加強人才培訓與國際交流，提升香港在智慧城市領域的國際影響力和話語權。

最後，我再次感謝兩個聯盟的貢獻，祝願你們竿頭猛進，再創高峰！也祝願今日出席酒會的各位朋友身體健康、事業宏達！謝謝大家！"
