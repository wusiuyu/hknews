Speech by FS at AI Global Talents Connect (English only),2025-08-26 11:55,2025-08-26 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600304.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at AI Global Talents Connect today (August 26):

Clara (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, Ms Clara Chan), Professor Huang (Chairman, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, Professor Huang Tiejun), Dr Wang (Director, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, Dr Wang Zhongyuan), distinguished guests and students, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning, and welcome to Hong Kong. It is a pleasure to join you today for the inaugural AI Global Talents Connect, hosted by the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited (HKIC) and the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI). This landmark occasion brings together some of the world's most brilliant minds in artificial intelligence - researchers, innovators, entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

AI is fundamentally reshaping industries, economies and societies, and ultimately, the global economy's competitive landscape. Its impact is both far-reaching and accelerating. Unlike many other technologies, where breakthroughs may take years, advances in AI often unfold within months. And its rapid progress has transformative promise across every sector. At the same time, it presents complex challenges around ethics, governance and responsibility for the society. For example, how can we prevent algorithm bias? How can we address concerns about job displacement? How can we ensure the safe and responsible development of AI, and that the red lines are not crossed? They demand collective wisdom and global co-operation.

Given the geopolitical landscape, technological fragmentation is intensifying. Nevertheless, no single country or region can - or should - dominate technological innovation. More breakthroughs will emerge from open dialogue, knowledge exchange and cross-border collaboration among scientists, innovators, engineers, entrepreneurs and businesses.

In this context, building an open, collaborative and inclusive community for AI is vital. Not only is it the key to advancing science and technology, it is also essential to attracting and retaining global talent, which is the driving force behind every innovation. 

Here in Hong Kong, we are fully committed to that vision. We have prioritised AI as a core industry for future development, a key enabler to upgrading our traditional industries and sectors. And we are leveraging our unique strengths across multiple dimensions.

First, in technology. Hong Kong is home to some of the world's top academic institutions. We take pride that three of our universities rank among the global top 20 in artificial intelligence and data science. These institutions are producing cutting-edge research and nurturing next-generation talent.

We have also been making significant, long-term investments in industry research and development. That includes the Hong Kong Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute, which we aim to establish next year. It will put emphasis on translating research into real-world applications, in areas such as healthcare, finance, logistics, education, and more.

Second, access to capital. As Asia's premier international financial centre, Hong Kong provides tech start-ups and companies at various stages with a full spectrum of funding options, from angel and venture capital to private equity, patient capital and IPOs (initial public offerings). By connecting global capital with promising and mature projects, we will create a dynamic environment where great concepts and ideas can scale and thrive.

Third, data advantage. Under our ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong guarantees the free flow of information and data. At the same time, we will introduce mechanisms for cross-boundary flow of data from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong for research and development purposes, under clear safeguards and robust data-security protocols. This will enable Hong Kong to serve as a unique convergence point of Mainland and international data, and a testing field for different applications. These are valuable assets in the age of AI.

Fourth, and most important, talent. Hong Kong's international and cosmopolitan culture, high quality of living, simple and low tax regime, and world-class education system make it an attractive destination for global talent.

But to ensure an abundant influx of AI talent, we want to raise our visibility and global standing in AI. That's why, in this year's Budget, I proposed the organisation of a young scientist forum on AI. I am delighted to see it come to life today, thanks to the joint efforts of the HKIC and the BAAI.

This forum is underpinned by two fundamental elements: openness and cross-disciplinary collaboration. It welcomes scientists, policymakers, investors and entrepreneurs from across geographies, whether they come from the Mainland, Asia, North America, Europe, or beyond. We believe this platform will catalyse intellectual exchanges, spark new ideas, and foster more partnerships in the AI space.

I’m pleased to note a further milestone: the Qingyuan Club, one of the BAAI's most important interdisciplinary initiatives, is being brought to Hong Kong with the support of the HKIC.

The Beijing Qingyuan Club has gathered many of China's top AI scientists, including leading contributors in large language models and embodied intelligence. The establishment of the Hong Kong Qingyuan Club marks another step forward in our ambition to become a global AI hub.

I very much hope that the Club will contribute to Hong Kong's AI ecosystem in three key areas.

First, pioneering frontier technologies. This, of course, includes engaging in more cutting-edge AI research and applications. This will entail more partnerships with academic institutions, investors, start-ups and tech firms so that we build a more vibrant and robust AI ecosystem together.

Second, contributing to global exchanges on AI. Technologies and applications aside, it would also be important to participate in the global dialogue about the future of AI, in particular its safe and responsible development.

Third, nurturing talent. Leverage your networks to attract, connect and cultivate AI talent, especially young innovators who will shape the future of the industry.

Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to the discussions, collaborations and partnerships that will emerge from today's global gathering. Let us work together to build a future where AI transforms societies for the better, and where Hong Kong plays a pivotal role in that journey.

Thank you very much."

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-26 11:34,2025-08-26 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600279.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 26) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."
"Speech by SJ at Hong Kong Bar Association - World Justice Project Conference ""Absence of Corruption - A Key Requirement for the Rule of Law"" (English only)",2025-08-26 11:33,2025-08-26 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600232.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the Hong Kong Bar Association and World Justice Project Conference ""Absence of Corruption - A Key Requirement for the Rule of Law"" today (August 26):

Dr Plipat (Asia Pacific Regional Director of the World Justice Project, Dr Srirak Pilpat), Mr Justice Macrae (Vice President of the Court of Appeal of the High Court, Mr Justice Andrew Macrae), Mr Maurellet, SC (Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, Mr José-Antonio Maurellet), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. I am very pleased and honoured to have the chance of speaking at today's conference co-organised by the World Justice Project (WJP) and the Hong Kong Bar Association, which is the first time the WJP organises such an event in Hong Kong. Before we hear from our eminent speakers, let me try to set the scene.

 The interrelationship between the rule of law and absence of corruption is universally recognised. In the United Nations Declaration of the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law dated September 19, 2012, member states recognised the negative impact of corruption, which obstructs economic growth and development, erodes public confidence, legitimacy and transparency, and hinders the making of fair and effective laws, as well as their administration, enforcement and adjudication; at the same time, they also stressed the importance of the rule of law as an essential element in addressing and preventing corruption.

 Hong Kong is perhaps one of the best places to hold a conference on this important topic. Ever since 2015, Hong Kong has always been ranked within the top 10 in the factor component of ""Absence of Corruption"" under the WJP Rule of Law Index. This factor component takes into account three forms of corruption, namely bribery, improper influence by public or private interests, and the misappropriation of public funds or other resources. These three forms of corruption are examined with respect to government officers in the executive branch, the judiciary, the military, the police, and the legislature.

 Corruption was widespread and a major social problem in Hong Kong in the 1960s and early 1970s. However, in a few decades' time, Hong Kong has become one of the least corrupt places in the world. In my view, Hong Kong's successful transformation in such a short time can be attributed to three main factors: first, our comprehensive legal framework; second, strong and independent law enforcement agencies and judiciary; and third, a deep anti-corruption culture in society.

Comprehensive legal framework

 First, as to our anti-corruption law, even though bribery has always been a common law offence and the first Hong Kong anti-corruption statute was made back in 1898 namely, the Misdemeanors Punishment Ordinance, the most important development was undoubtedly the enactment of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) in 1971. POBO introduced novel offences and wide powers of investigations. For example, s.10 of POBO creates the offence of ""possession of unexplained property"", which imposes upon a public office holder the burden of giving a satisfactory explanation if he maintains a standard of living above that which is commensurate with his present or past emoluments, or if he is in control of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his past or present emoluments.

 In addition to POBO, which is general in nature, there are other more specific anti-corruption statutes, such as the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance, which prohibits corrupt conduct and illegal conduct at elections.

 Apart from statutory offences, the common law offence of misconduct in public office (MIPO) is a powerful anti-corruption legal tool. In the judgment of our Court of Final Appeal (CFA) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) v Hui Rafael Junior (2017) 20 HKCFAR 264, the CFA held that this common law offence may include solicitation or acceptance of a bride. The following acts and omissions have been held to constitute the offence: failing to disclose a relationship with a company and showing preferential treatment to that company by permitting it to tender for government contracts despite lacking the requisite experience; accepting free sexual favours provided by prostitutes controlled by the owner of a nightclub; obtaining and using the personal particular of patients of a public hospital to advertise the commencement of a private medical practice. The essence of the offence is the abuse of public trust by the officer. Hence, in that case, the CFA upheld the conviction against the defendant who, in anticipation of his appointment to a senior public office, received large sums of money from others as a ""general sweetener"" for favourable inclination while in office.

 Criminal offences, whether under the common law or statutes, are supplemented by causes of action under our civil law, in particular, the law of constructive trusts, which may be used to compel corrupt public officials to disgorge illegal benefits derived from corruption. The common law principle was laid down by the Privy Council in its landmark opinion in AG for Hong Kong v Reid [1994] 1 AC 324, where it was held that bribe money received by a high-ranking government official, and the overseas property acquired thereafter by him and his wife with the bribe money, were held on constructive trust for the Hong Kong Government, and had to be given over to the Government on the ground that an employer obtains a proprietary interest in a bribe received by his employee.

 In addition to the general duty to obey the relevant laws, public officers are obliged to comply with relevant codes of conduct in this respect which form part and parcel of their employment contracts. For example, the Civil Service Code requires all civil servants to stay vigilant against corrupt practices, observe the highest standards of conduct and guard against possible breach of POBO and MIPO; they should ensure that no actual, perceived or potential conflict of interest will arise between their official duties and private interests; they should not use their official position to further personal interests or the private interest of others; they should not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any advantage of a gift which would influence, or might reasonably be seen to influence, the discharge of their duties and responsibilities. The Code for Officials under the Political Appointment System contains similar provisions; and because they will have access to highly sensitive information, they are also required to declare their investments and interests and such declarations will be made available for public inspection.

 Importantly, while the WJP places emphasis on absence of corruption in the public sector, the laws of Hong Kong are equally strict insofar as corruption in the private sector is concerned. Section 9 of POBO makes it an offence for a person to offer an agent, or for an agent to solicit or accept, an advantage in return for him doing an act in relation to his principal's affairs or business. ""Agent"" includes any person employed by or acting for another. The Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Fung Hok Cheung [2008] 5 HKLRD 846 rejected the argument that a principal/agent relationship will only arise when a fiduciary relationship exists between those two persons; and held that the word ""agent"" should be given its natural and ordinary meaning not restricted by the principles of agency developed in the common law of contract. The civil remedies based on constructive trust that I have mentioned a moment ago are equally applicable to agents receiving brides in the private sector.

Strong and independent law enforcement agencies and judiciary

 Let me turn to the second key factor. No matter how comprehensive the laws are, they can only achieve their intended purposes if they can be, and are in fact, enforced effectively. While many law enforcement agencies are involved, the turning point insofar as the Hong Kong experience is concerned must be the establishment of the IndependentCommission Against Corruption in 1974. Apart from being given very wide investigation and related powers, the most crucial feature is its independence. S.5(2) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Ordinance provides expressly that ""The Commissioner shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person other than the Chief Executive.""

 Having regard to the fact that Hong Kong is an international financial centre, it is worth mentioning that the Securities and Futures Commission, an independent statutory body set up pursuant to the Securities and Futures Commission Ordinance responsible for the regulation of Hong Kong's securities and futures markets, has a strong focus on tackling corruption, particularly related to market manipulation and other financial misconduct.

 The significant contributions made by our strong and independent judiciary must, of course, not be overlooked. The judgments that I have referred to are good examples where our courts developed important jurisprudence in relevant areas of the law, and ensured that they would be fairly and properly applied.

Deep anti-corruption culture

 The third key factor, namely, a deep anti-corruption culture in society is, in my view, probably the most critical one. Many fellow citizens belonging to the older generations of Hong Kong were once victims of corruption: for example, in the old days, even hospital amahs would ask for ""tips"" before giving patients a glass of water. Most naturally, they would share their painful experiences with the younger generations. Today, as a result of the tremendous efforts made by the Hong Kong people collectively, Hong Kong has become one of the least corrupt places in the world. Hong Kong's global competitiveness has risen back to the third place in the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking 2025; and most importantly for the present purpose, Hong Kong's ranking of ""Bribery and corruption do not exist"" as one of the criteria under the competitiveness factor ""Government Efficiency"" is the fourth in the world, and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. Hong Kong people, of course, cherish and are proud of these achievements. We have zero-tolerance to corruption; and are very proactive in reporting and assisting in the investigation of suspected corruption cases. I would venture to suggest that anti-corruption has already become an integral part of the ""genetic makeup"" of Hong Kong people.

The future

 While there is no room for complacency, I have full confidence that HongKong's fight against corruption will go from strength to strength in future. Putting aside the fact that the anti-corruption culture is already ingrained in our society, another very important reason is that the comprehensive legal framework as well as our strong and independent institutions are well preserved by the Basic Law pursuant to the fundamental and long-lasting principle of ""one country, two systems"". For example, the Basic Law provides constitutional guarantees that the common law system shall continue; the judiciary shall have independent judicial power including that of final adjudication; and the Commission against Corruption shall function independently and be accountable to the Chief Executive.

International co-operation

 Lastly, let me turn to international co-operation, it is essential in the fight against corruption. The United Nations (UN) Convention Against Corruption is applicable to Hong Kong; and Hong Kong is an active member of relevant international organisations such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In the past decade, the Department of Justice has processed over 2 800 mutual legal assistance requests and more than 40 surrender cases that concern offences covered by the UN Convention.

 Another important aspect of international co-operation is capacity building and experience sharing. International independent non-government organisations such as the WPJ clearly play an important role in this respect. Today's conference serves as a prime example and an excellent starting point in our collaboration with WJP in this respect, and I therefore look forward to more collaborations between the WJP and Hong Kong in future.

"Speech by SJ at Hong Kong Bar Association - World Justice Project Conference ""Absence of Corruption - A Key Requirement for the Rule of Law""",2025-08-26 11:33,2025-08-26 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082600232.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the Hong Kong Bar Association and World Justice Project Conference ""Absence of Corruption - A Key Requirement for the Rule of Law"" today (August 26):

Dr Plipat (Asia Pacific Regional Director of the World Justice Project, Dr Srirak Pilpat), Mr Justice Macrae (Vice President of the Court of Appeal of the High Court, Mr Justice Andrew Macrae), Mr Maurellet, SC (Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, Mr José-Antonio Maurellet), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. I am very pleased and honoured to have the chance of speaking at today's conference co-organised by the World Justice Project (WJP) and the Hong Kong Bar Association, which is the first time the WJP organises such an event in Hong Kong. Before we hear from our eminent speakers, let me try to set the scene.

 The interrelationship between the rule of law and absence of corruption is universally recognised. In the United Nations Declaration of the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law dated September 19, 2012, member states recognised the negative impact of corruption, which obstructs economic growth and development, erodes public confidence, legitimacy and transparency, and hinders the making of fair and effective laws, as well as their administration, enforcement and adjudication; at the same time, they also stressed the importance of the rule of law as an essential element in addressing and preventing corruption.

 Hong Kong is perhaps one of the best places to hold a conference on this important topic. Ever since 2015, Hong Kong has always been ranked within the top 10 in the factor component of ""Absence of Corruption"" under the WJP Rule of Law Index. This factor component takes into account three forms of corruption, namely bribery, improper influence by public or private interests, and the misappropriation of public funds or other resources. These three forms of corruption are examined with respect to government officers in the executive branch, the judiciary, the military, the police, and the legislature.

 Corruption was widespread and a major social problem in Hong Kong in the 1960s and early 1970s. However, in a few decades' time, Hong Kong has become one of the least corrupt places in the world. In my view, Hong Kong's successful transformation in such a short time can be attributed to three main factors: first, our comprehensive legal framework; second, strong and independent law enforcement agencies and judiciary; and third, a deep anti-corruption culture in society.

Comprehensive legal framework

 First, as to our anti-corruption law, even though bribery has always been a common law offence and the first Hong Kong anti-corruption statute was made back in 1898 namely, the Misdemeanors Punishment Ordinance, the most important development was undoubtedly the enactment of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) in 1971. POBO introduced novel offences and wide powers of investigations. For example, s.10 of POBO creates the offence of ""possession of unexplained property"", which imposes upon a public office holder the burden of giving a satisfactory explanation if he maintains a standard of living above that which is commensurate with his present or past emoluments, or if he is in control of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his past or present emoluments.

 In addition to POBO, which is general in nature, there are other more specific anti-corruption statutes, such as the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance, which prohibits corrupt conduct and illegal conduct at elections.

 Apart from statutory offences, the common law offence of misconduct in public office (MIPO) is a powerful anti-corruption legal tool. In the judgment of our Court of Final Appeal (CFA) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) v Hui Rafael Junior (2017) 20 HKCFAR 264, the CFA held that this common law offence may include solicitation or acceptance of a bride. The following acts and omissions have been held to constitute the offence: failing to disclose a relationship with a company and showing preferential treatment to that company by permitting it to tender for government contracts despite lacking the requisite experience; accepting free sexual favours provided by prostitutes controlled by the owner of a nightclub; obtaining and using the personal particular of patients of a public hospital to advertise the commencement of a private medical practice. The essence of the offence is the abuse of public trust by the officer. Hence, in that case, the CFA upheld the conviction against the defendant who, in anticipation of his appointment to a senior public office, received large sums of money from others as a ""general sweetener"" for favourable inclination while in office.

 Criminal offences, whether under the common law or statutes, are supplemented by causes of action under our civil law, in particular, the law of constructive trusts, which may be used to compel corrupt public officials to disgorge illegal benefits derived from corruption. The common law principle was laid down by the Privy Council in its landmark opinion in AG for Hong Kong v Reid [1994] 1 AC 324, where it was held that bribe money received by a high-ranking government official, and the overseas property acquired thereafter by him and his wife with the bribe money, were held on constructive trust for the Hong Kong Government, and had to be given over to the Government on the ground that an employer obtains a proprietary interest in a bribe received by his employee.

 In addition to the general duty to obey the relevant laws, public officers are obliged to comply with relevant codes of conduct in this respect which form part and parcel of their employment contracts. For example, the Civil Service Code requires all civil servants to stay vigilant against corrupt practices, observe the highest standards of conduct and guard against possible breach of POBO and MIPO; they should ensure that no actual, perceived or potential conflict of interest will arise between their official duties and private interests; they should not use their official position to further personal interests or the private interest of others; they should not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any advantage of a gift which would influence, or might reasonably be seen to influence, the discharge of their duties and responsibilities. The Code for Officials under the Political Appointment System contains similar provisions; and because they will have access to highly sensitive information, they are also required to declare their investments and interests and such declarations will be made available for public inspection.

 Importantly, while the WJP places emphasis on absence of corruption in the public sector, the laws of Hong Kong are equally strict insofar as corruption in the private sector is concerned. Section 9 of POBO makes it an offence for a person to offer an agent, or for an agent to solicit or accept, an advantage in return for him doing an act in relation to his principal's affairs or business. ""Agent"" includes any person employed by or acting for another. The Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Fung Hok Cheung [2008] 5 HKLRD 846 rejected the argument that a principal/agent relationship will only arise when a fiduciary relationship exists between those two persons; and held that the word ""agent"" should be given its natural and ordinary meaning not restricted by the principles of agency developed in the common law of contract. The civil remedies based on constructive trust that I have mentioned a moment ago are equally applicable to agents receiving brides in the private sector.

Strong and independent law enforcement agencies and judiciary

 Let me turn to the second key factor. No matter how comprehensive the laws are, they can only achieve their intended purposes if they can be, and are in fact, enforced effectively. While many law enforcement agencies are involved, the turning point insofar as the Hong Kong experience is concerned must be the establishment of the IndependentCommission Against Corruption in 1974. Apart from being given very wide investigation and related powers, the most crucial feature is its independence. S.5(2) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Ordinance provides expressly that ""The Commissioner shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person other than the Chief Executive.""

 Having regard to the fact that Hong Kong is an international financial centre, it is worth mentioning that the Securities and Futures Commission, an independent statutory body set up pursuant to the Securities and Futures Commission Ordinance responsible for the regulation of Hong Kong's securities and futures markets, has a strong focus on tackling corruption, particularly related to market manipulation and other financial misconduct.

 The significant contributions made by our strong and independent judiciary must, of course, not be overlooked. The judgments that I have referred to are good examples where our courts developed important jurisprudence in relevant areas of the law, and ensured that they would be fairly and properly applied.

Deep anti-corruption culture

 The third key factor, namely, a deep anti-corruption culture in society is, in my view, probably the most critical one. Many fellow citizens belonging to the older generations of Hong Kong were once victims of corruption: for example, in the old days, even hospital amahs would ask for ""tips"" before giving patients a glass of water. Most naturally, they would share their painful experiences with the younger generations. Today, as a result of the tremendous efforts made by the Hong Kong people collectively, Hong Kong has become one of the least corrupt places in the world. Hong Kong's global competitiveness has risen back to the third place in the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking 2025; and most importantly for the present purpose, Hong Kong's ranking of ""Bribery and corruption do not exist"" as one of the criteria under the competitiveness factor ""Government Efficiency"" is the fourth in the world, and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. Hong Kong people, of course, cherish and are proud of these achievements. We have zero-tolerance to corruption; and are very proactive in reporting and assisting in the investigation of suspected corruption cases. I would venture to suggest that anti-corruption has already become an integral part of the ""genetic makeup"" of Hong Kong people.

The future

 While there is no room for complacency, I have full confidence that HongKong's fight against corruption will go from strength to strength in future. Putting aside the fact that the anti-corruption culture is already ingrained in our society, another very important reason is that the comprehensive legal framework as well as our strong and independent institutions are well preserved by the Basic Law pursuant to the fundamental and long-lasting principle of ""one country, two systems"". For example, the Basic Law provides constitutional guarantees that the common law system shall continue; the judiciary shall have independent judicial power including that of final adjudication; and the Commission against Corruption shall function independently and be accountable to the Chief Executive.

International co-operation

 Lastly, let me turn to international co-operation, it is essential in the fight against corruption. The United Nations (UN) Convention Against Corruption is applicable to Hong Kong; and Hong Kong is an active member of relevant international organisations such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In the past decade, the Department of Justice has processed over 2 800 mutual legal assistance requests and more than 40 surrender cases that concern offences covered by the UN Convention.

 Another important aspect of international co-operation is capacity building and experience sharing. International independent non-government organisations such as the WPJ clearly play an important role in this respect. Today's conference serves as a prime example and an excellent starting point in our collaboration with WJP in this respect, and I therefore look forward to more collaborations between the WJP and Hong Kong in future. On this note, I wish you all a very constructive and enjoyable conference. Thank you."
「新國風」民族舞劇《李清照》九月以宋詞雅韻舞動「中華文化節」（附圖）,2025-08-26 11:00,2025-08-26 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082500249.htm,"由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）策劃的「中華文化節2025」，將於九月呈獻由上海歌舞團打造的「新國風」民族舞劇《李清照》。此劇作為海派的守正創新之作，以現代視角和藝術形式呈現宋代著名女詞人李清照的曠世才情與跌宕人生，重新詮釋宋代藝術之美，與當代觀眾同頻共振，感受中華優秀傳統文化的博大精深和獨特魅力。此節目為「國風國韻飄香江」系列節目之一。

《李清照》全劇以15個詞牌名為引，透過舞蹈藝術將膾炙人口的詩詞意境串聯起李清照人生的不同階段：從早年在詞壇嶄露頭角的「爭渡，爭渡，驚起一灘鷗鷺」，到上元燈節遇見第一任丈夫趙明誠的一眼萬年；因靖康之變而激出愛國情懷而寫的「生當作人傑，死亦為鬼雄」，到喪夫後哀婉悲苦的「尋尋覓覓，冷冷清清，淒淒慘慘戚戚」；南渡後遭第二任丈夫張汝舟矇騙而寫下「物是人非事事休，欲語淚先流」，最後將目光投向家國天下，「欲將血淚寄山河，去灑東山一抔土」，李清照決定校勘著述《金石錄》，賡續中華文脈。

此劇的創作團隊選取「汝瓷」作為塑造李清照一生的關鍵意象，因汝瓷在燒製過程中由平坦光潔至開片後產生裂紋，恰如李清照的人生。其詞風以宋室南渡為界，從婉約到豪邁的轉變也體現在此劇的舞風中，通過古典舞的韻律與現代舞的創新相融合，傳遞詩詞中的文學意蘊和家國情懷，同時呈現宋韻文化、非物質文化遺產（非遺）和民俗，例如李清照與趙明誠在初相識時的雙人舞便巧用古典舞中的「小五花」表達二人的羞澀和試探；「滾燈舞」一段則汲取中國各地滾燈的表演元素創新編排而成，煥發非遺傳統文化的生命力。

這部秉承海派文化精緻唯美之風的舞劇，舞台美術汲取了宋代美學的精髓，設計簡約雅致，注重對留白的使用，通過月洞門、窗格、桌椅、几案、硯台、筆墨、汝瓷、香爐、茶具、棋盤等道具，勾勒出一幅雅致的宋代生活美學圖景。由於李清照下半生在江南度過，江南的園林、建築特點和民俗風情都在作品中呈現。場景中不少的道具都能從古畫典籍中找到出處，再利用三維打印技術而成，以現代科技煥發中華優秀傳統文化。

舞台調度方面則巧妙地融合舞者的肢體語言與色彩的互動。劇中大量運用中華傳統色，例如以素淨淡雅的「汝瓷」天青色作為主角李清照的主色調，抒情獨舞段則採用清冷色調，市井和朝堂場景則色彩艷麗，上元燈節一段更以藤黃、花青渲染出節日氣氛。音樂方面，宋曲的清靈配上江南絲竹的韻律，並巧妙地融合西方音樂元素，立體呈現宋代之美，江南之韻。

此劇的主創團隊陣容強大，包括由上海歌舞團團長王延擔任製作人兼藝術監製，另邀得知名編舞張帝莎、劉小荷聯袂執導，著名劇作家喻榮軍擔任編劇，集合作曲郭好為、舞美設計胡艷君等業界頂尖人物與一眾優秀青年藝術家精心打造，舞團首席演員周曉輝和榮典‧首席演員王佳俊分別飾演李清照和趙明誠。此劇自去年十月在第二十三屆中國上海國際藝術節開幕式首演以來，好評如潮，並入選二○二四年度國家藝術基金資助項目。

上海歌舞團自1979年成立以來，創作眾多藝術精品，包括舞劇《霸王別姬》、《朱䴉》和《永不消逝的電波》等，並曾獲「五個一工程」獎、文華大奬、國家舞台藝術精品工程、中國舞蹈「荷花獎」金獎等榮譽。藝團曾於全球多個國家及地區演出，在國內外贏得高度讚譽。

明月耀香江——上海歌舞團：舞劇《李清照》九月二十六日及二十七日（星期五及六）晚上七時三十分在香港文化中心大劇院上演。票價分220元、280元、340元、420元及500元，門票現於城市售票網（www.urbtix.hk）發售。電話購票請致電3166 1288。由即日起，購買指定「中華文化節」舞台演出節目、中國戲曲節2025「戲曲電影欣賞」及《大師傳藝‧尋古知新》講座系列可享團體購票或套票優惠。查詢節目詳情及購票優惠，請致電2268 7323，或瀏覽www.ccf.gov.hk/tc/programme/city-under-the-moon-dance-drama-azure-after-the-rain。

"New Chinese-style dance drama ""Azure After the Rain"" to fly high at Chinese Culture Festival with elegance of Song poetry in September (with photos)",2025-08-26 11:00,2025-08-26 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/26/P2025082500286.htm,"  The Chinese Culture Festival (CCF) 2025, organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), will present the new Chinese-style dance drama ""Azure After the Rain"" by the Shanghai Dance Theatre in September. As a Shanghai-style work that preserves traditions while embracing innovation, the production reinterprets the unparalleled literary talent and tumultuous life of the famous Song dynasty poetess Li Qingzhao, as well as the artistic elegance of the Song dynasty from contemporary perspectives and art forms. The performances resonate with today's audiences, allowing them to experience the profound richness and unique allure of fine traditional Chinese culture. This is one of the programmes of the Chinese Performing Arts Hong Kong Season Series.

  ""Azure After the Rain"" unfolds through 15 titles of ""cipai"" (classical poetic song tunes), weaving Li's life journey with dance interpretations of her iconic verses. It begins with Li's early literary fame captured in ""Struggling to get out, struggling to get out, I startled a whole sandbar of egrets into flight"", then depicts her love at first sight with her first husband Zhao Mingcheng during the Lantern Festival. The upheaval of the Catastrophe of Jingkang ignites Li's patriotic defiance with ""In life be a hero among men, in death be a champion among ghosts"", while mournful widowhood finds expression in ""Searching, hunting, seeking, looking, so chilly and yet so clear, distressed, dismal, and forlorn"". After remarrying the deceitful Zhang Ruzhou during the southern migration, her betrayed heart inspired ""The objects are right, the people wrong, everything is over now! About to speak, tears first flow"". The finale transcends personal sorrow as she gazes upon war-torn lands, expressing ""Take my blood-stained tears to those hills and rivers, and sprinkle them on a clod of East Mountain soil"". Li resolved to compile and critique the ""Catalogue of Inscriptions on Metal and Stone"", and to continue the Chinese literary legacy.

  The creative team of the production has chosen Ru porcelain as the key motif embodying Li's life journey, as the cracks that emerge during the firing process - from smooth glaze into a web of intricate fissures - mirror the trajectory of her life. The shift in her poetic style, from lyrical tenderness to bold intensity following the Song dynasty's migration to the south of the Yangtze River, is also reflected in the choreography of the dance drama. By blending the cadence of classical dance with modern dance's innovative expressiveness, the production conveys the literary essence and patriotic sentiments embedded in Li's verses, while showcasing the cultural aesthetics of the Song dynasty, intangible heritage and folk traditions. For instance: the duet between Li and Zhao upon their first encounter ingeniously incorporates the classical dance technique ""xiaowuhua"" (a fluttering hand movement), to convey the timid yet profound connection. Meanwhile, the ""rolling lantern dance"" segment integrates performance elements of rolling lantern (gundeng) traditions from across China, revitalising the cultural vitality of this intangible heritage.

  This dance drama, embodying the refined elegance of Shanghai-style culture, draws inspiration from the aesthetic essence of the Song dynasty. Its stage design is minimalist yet sophisticated, emphasising the artistic use of negative space. Through set pieces such as moon gates, lattice windows, chairs and tables, scholar's desks, inkstones, brushes, Ru porcelain, incense burners, tea sets and chessboards, it sketches an elegant tableau of Song-era living aesthetics. As Li spent the latter half of her life in Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River), the work incorporates the region's garden architecture, structural motifs and folk customs. Many props are meticulously sourced from classical paintings and historical texts using 3D printing technology, bridging modern technology with fine Chinese traditional culture to revitalise its legacy.

  In terms of stage choreography, the production seamlessly blends dancers' movements with dynamic colourful interplay, and extensively employs traditional Chinese hues. For instance, the serene celadon (azure after the rain) tone of Ru porcelain serves as the dominant tone for Li, while her introspective solos adopt cooler shades. Bustling market and court scenes burst with vibrant colours, and the Lantern Festival sequence dazzles with vine-yellow (tenghuang) and flower-blue (huaqing) tones to evoke festive exuberance. For music, the ethereal melodies of Song-era tunes intertwine with the rhythmic textures of Jiangnan silk-and-bamboo music, subtly infused with Western elements, creating a multidimensional homage to the charms of the Song dynasty and Jiangnan.

  The creative team boasts an all-star lineup: Shanghai Dance Theatre's director Wang Yan serves as producer and artistic supervisor, joined by acclaimed choreographers Zhang Disha and Liu Xiaohe as chief directors, with renowned playwright Yu Rongjun, composer Guo Haowei, set designer Hu Yanjun, and more, which is a collaboration of industry luminaries and emerging talent. The production stars the troupe's chief dancer Zhou Xiaohui, and chief dancer with honour and glory Wang Jiajun, portraying Li Qingzhao and Zhao Mingcheng, respectively. Since its premiere as the opening programme of the 23rd China Shanghai International Arts Festival in October last year, the production has garnered acclaim and was selected as a 2024 China National Arts Fund support project.

  Since its establishment in 1979, the Shanghai Dance Theatre has produced numerous artistic masterpieces, including the dance drama ""Farewell to My Concubine"", ""Crested Ibises"", ""The Eternal Wave"", and more. The troupe has been honoured with prestigious awards such as the Five One Project Award, the Wenhua Grand Award, the National Fine Stage Arts Project Award and the Gold Award of the China Dance Lotus Award. The troupe has performed in many countries and regions worldwide, earning widespread acclaim both domestically and internationally.

  ""City under the Moon - Dance Drama 'Azure After the Rain' by Shanghai Dance Theatre"" will be held at 7.30pm on September 26 and 27 (Friday and Saturday) at the Grand Theatre of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre (HKCC). Tickets priced at $220, $280, $340, $420 and $500 are available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288.

Customs officers intercepted the incoming 53-year-old female passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on August 23 and seized 3 000 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $12,300 and a duty potential of about $9,900 from a carton box and recycle bags in her possession. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.  

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

The first case involved a male passenger, aged 31, who arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday (August 24). During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 7kg of suspected cannabis buds from 14 vacuum-sealed plastic bags inside his check-in suitcase. The estimated market value was about $1.6 million. The man was subsequently arrested.

In the second case, a 32-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Milan, Italy, today (August 25). During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 18kg of suspected ketamine from six transparent plastic bags inside his check-in suitcase with an estimated market value of about $8.3 million. The man was subsequently arrested.

After an investigation, the arrested man in the first case has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and the case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (August 26). For the second case, an investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

The CFS urged consumers who are allergic to milk not to consume the affected batches of the products concerned. Those who feel unwell after consuming any of the products concerned should seek medical treatment. The trade should stop using or selling the affected batches of the products immediately if they possess any of them.

""The CFS received a notification from the Food Standards Australia New Zealand through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) that the above-mentioned products are being recalled, as they may contain milk, an allergen, but it was not declared on the products' food labels. According to the information provided by INFOSAN, the affected products have been imported into Hong Kong,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately contacted local importers to follow up. A preliminary investigation found that the above-mentioned importer had imported into Hong Kong the affected batches of the products concerned.

CHP investigates cluster of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae carrier cases,2025-08-25 20:15,2025-08-25 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500758.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (August 25) investigating a cluster of Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) carrier cases involving six residents of a residential care home for the elderly (RCHE), and reminded all RCHEs to adhere to theGuidelines on Prevention of Communicable Diseasesin RCHE(the Guidelines) to implement measures for the detection, prevention and control of infectious diseases.

The CHP received notification from the Hospital Authority (HA) that six residents (three males and three females aged between 68 and 85) of an RCHE in Yuen Long had recently attended a public hospital for treatment due to their underlying illnesses. Their samples tested positive for CPE upon laboratory testing, but all patients are carriers and none of them exhibited symptoms associated with CPE infection.

 After receiving the notification from the HA, the CHP immediately conducted epidemiological investigations and suspected that CPE was transmitted within the institution. The CHP is conducting a screening at the RCHE concerned to determine if there are any additional CPE-carriers. Staff of the CHP conducted a site inspection and found that the RCHE concerned had not fully implemented the measures recommended in the Guidelines. The CHP reminded the RCHE to strictly adhere to the Guidelines for proper nursing procedures and to thoroughly clean and disinfect the environment, and ensure proper hand hygiene for staff and residents.

The CHP will continue to put the RCHE under medical surveillance and investigate the case cluster.

Enterobacteriaceae (for example, Escherichia coli andKlebsiella) are common pathogens that can cause infections in various parts of the body, including urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections or bacteraemia. CPE are enterobacteriaceae that produce carbapenemase, an enzyme that can deactivate carbapenems and other beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins. These bacteria are commonly resistant to multiple antibiotics, limiting therapeutic options, and may render severe clinical infections difficult to treat. The range of diseases associated with CPE varies from asymptomatic carriage to potentially life-threatening or fatal infections. The level of risk depends on which part of the body is affected by the infection and the patient's general health.

ââProper use of antibiotics and maintaining good personal and environmental hygiene, especially hand hygiene, are important for preventing emergence and cross-transmission of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs), such as CPE. In addition, susceptible individuals such as the elderly, infants, young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immunity can reduce their risk of contracting MDROs by not eating raw or undercooked foods."

中心早前接獲醫院管理局（醫管局）通知，元朗一間安老院舍有六名院友（三男三女，年齡介乎68至85歲），因自身疾病近期先後到公立醫院求診。他們的樣本經化驗後，證實帶有產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌，但全部病人屬帶菌者，並沒有出現產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌感染的相關病徵。

中心接獲醫管局通知後，隨即展開流行病學調查，懷疑該耐藥性細菌於院舍內傳播。中心正在院舍為接觸者進行篩查，以確定是否有其他帶菌者。中心人員已巡查涉事院舍，發現該院舍未有全面執行指引建議的措施。中心提醒院舍必須按指引妥善進行護理程序、徹底清潔及消毒環境，確保員工和院友手部衞生。

中心會繼續對該院舍進行醫學監察，亦會繼續調查個案群組。

腸道桿菌（例如大腸桿菌和克雷伯桿菌）是常見的病原體，能引致身體不同部位的感染，包括尿道炎、腹腔內部感染和菌血病。產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌產生的碳青霉烯酶酵素，可令碳青霉烯和其他β-內酰胺（如青霉素）抗生素失效。這些細菌通常對多種抗生素具有抗藥性，限制了治療的選擇，有機會導致難以治療的嚴重感染。這類細菌的帶菌者可以毫無病徵，但細菌也可引致嚴重甚至致命的感染。風險程度取決於受感染的部位和患者的健康狀況。

正確使用抗生素及注意個人和環境衞生，尤其是手部衞生，對預防多重抗藥性細菌如產碳青霉烯酶腸道桿菌的出現和交叉傳播至為重要。此外，老幼病孕等高危人士避免進食生或未煮熟食物，可減低感染多重抗藥性細菌的風險。"

  Mrs Yeung said that in this entire nation's resistance against Japanese aggression, the brave soldiers spared no effort and fought as one against the enemy to defend the country amid the most difficult situation. They, with their attentiveness to duties and dedication, served as a role model for the civil service to learn from. She said, ""The sacrifices and sufferings of countless compatriots must not be forgotten. I call on civil servant colleagues, especially those of the younger generation, to gain a deep understanding and take to their hearts the blood, tears and hardship during the war, to grasp the significance of the victory in the War of Resistance to national rejuvenation, and to cherish the hard-won peace.

  ""It has been 80 years since the victory in the War of Resistance. For those who have no first-hand war experience and were born in an era of rapid national development, it may be difficult for them to imagine the brutality of the war. As such, we particularly encourage new recruits and the younger new generations to participate in activities commemorating the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance, or to visit thematic exhibitions. Through heart-touching historical photos, they feel the efforts made by our predecessors for our country, learn from history, and remain steadfast in safeguarding national sovereignty and national security, and development interests in the face of the complex and rapidly changing environment in the future.""

  The Civil Service Bureau (CSB) also encourages civil service staff unions to take an active role in organising thematic activities on commemorating the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance to enhance colleagues' sense of national identity and cultivate their patriotism. The CSB will arrange for representatives from the civil service staff unions to visit a thematic exhibition on the War of Resistance at the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence in September, and support them in organising related visits to deepen colleagues' understanding of the history of the War of Resistance in the country and Hong Kong.

  To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance, the Civil Service College (CSC), following a talk to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the victory in Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and in World Anti-Fascist War in late July, will host two more thematic talks on the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression in September and October. The talks will explore how the Chinese nation resisted the impacts of the war, underwent transformation amid hardships, and advanced the process of national modernisation. The talks will also review Hong Kong's role and contributions during the war.

  In addition, the CSC has incorporated elements of the history of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression into its regular national studies programmes, enabling civil servants to gain a deeper understanding of history, further enhance their sense of national identity, awareness of safeguarding national security and patriotism, and recognise the pivotal role of the Chinese Communist Party during the War of Resistance."

The patient's family was informed immediately. A local search for the patient within the hospital compound and in the vicinity was conducted but the patient could not be located. The hospital then reported the incident to the Police for assistance. The hospital was informed by the Police at around 10pm that the patient was found dead after falling from a height in the evening.

  The hospital was saddened by the incident and expressed deep condolences to the family of the patient. The hospital will provide assistance to the family as required and will fully co-operate with the Police investigation.

  The hospital is very concerned about the incident, which was classified as a sentinel event. The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority Head Office via the Advance Incident Reporting System. A root cause analysis panel will be formed to investigate the incident."
CHP reminds schools to take measures to prevent spread of diseases as school term about to begin,2025-08-25 19:23,2025-08-25 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500699.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 25) issued a letter to all schools through the Education Bureau, and urged them to take active measures on their campuses to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, particularly mosquito-borne diseases, in order to safeguard students' health.

  ""As many students will be back to school next week, the CHP sent a letter to primary and secondary schools, kindergartens and childcare centres in Hong Kong to remind them of the risk of mosquito-borne diseases, such as chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF), in Hong Kong. In addition to these mosquito-borne diseases, local seasonal influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) have shown an upward trend in activity levels over the past one to two months. Schools should stay alert, and regularly clean and disinfect to lower the risk of transmitting communicable diseases in school,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

He also appealed to students and school staff to promptly seek medical advice if they develop symptoms such as fever, respiratory symptoms, diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rashes. They should not return to campus for lessons or work.

The following are the current activity levels of mosquito-borne diseases, respiratory diseases and HFMD in Hong Kong, along with preventive measures.

A. CF and DF

CF is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus. It is characterised by fever and debilitating joint pain. Other common signs and symptoms include rash, muscle pain, headache, nausea and fatigue. Symptoms usually last for a few days. While most patients recover fully, joint pain may persist for several months in some cases. Severe symptoms and deaths from CF are rare. However, high-risk groups, including young children (particularly those under one-year-old), are more likely to develop complications after infection. As of today, the CHP recorded nine CF cases this year. All were imported cases.

DF is an acute febrile viral illness with symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, rash, muscle and joint pain. The symptoms of the first infection are usually mild, but subsequent infections with dengue virus of other serotypes are more likely to result in severe dengue, which may progress to circulatory failure, shock and even death. As of August 21, the CHP recorded 41 DF cases this year. All were imported cases.

These mosquito-borne diseases are not transmitted from person to person. However, schools should take measures to strengthen efforts to prevent water accumulation and eliminate potential breeding grounds of mosquitoes, such as changing water for plants at least once a week, covering all water containers tightly and keeping all drains free from blockage. School management is advised to appoint designated staff to be responsible for mosquito prevention and control on campus. Details are available fromthe guidelines published by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.

B. Respiratory infections

The CHP's latest surveillance data showed that local seasonal influenza activity has increased slightly since mid-July. For other respiratory pathogens, the activity of RSV has been gradually increasing since June, and it is expected to remain active for some time. Overall, rhinovirus/enterovirus and RSV have relatively higher activity levels among respiratory pathogens detected in paediatric respiratory specimens received by the Hospital Authority. According to previous surveillance data, after the start of the new school year, the weather will get cooler, and it may lead to more outbreaks of respiratory tract infections in schools. Additionally, the activities of both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza may increase at the end of this year or early next year.

Vaccination is the first line of defence against seasonal influenza, reducing the chance of serious complications or death after infection. Parents are advised to arrange for their children to participate in the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) outreach activities at school or to visit their family doctor for the SIV at the start of the new school year to enhance personal protection. Studies have shown that children who receive the SIV are likely to reduce school absenteeism. Parents should note that it takes about two weeks after vaccination for the body to develop sufficient antibodies to protect against influenza infection. Therefore, vaccination should be completed well in advance of the onset of winter. The DH has earlier sent a letter to all schools in Hong Kong informing them of the arrangements for the 2025/26 SIV School Outreach Programme. The majority of schools have responded positively. Based on local experience, school participation in the outreach vaccination programme can double children's influenza vaccination rates, effectively strengthening the immunity barrier of schoolchildren. Schools that have yet to join the programmes should enrol as soon as possible.

In addition, to prevent respiratory diseases, members of the public should maintain good personal, hand and environmental hygiene. Students/staff members with respiratory symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild, should wear a surgical mask, refrain from going to work or attending classes, avoid crowded places and seek medical advice promptly. They should maintain hand hygiene before putting on and after removing a mask.

C. HFMD

HFMD is a common disease in children usually caused by enteroviruses such as coxsackie viruses and enterovirus 71 (EV71). In Hong Kong, the peak season for HFMD and EV71 is usually from May to July, with a smaller peak occurring from October to December after the start of the school year. This year, an upward trend in certain indicators monitoring HFMD activity was observed between June and August. As of August 21, the CHP recorded 79 HFMD outbreaks in schools this year.

HFMD is mainly transmitted by contact with an infected person's nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from vesicles or stool, or after touching contaminated objects. To prevent the spread of HFMD within school settings, affected children should remain at home and refrain from attending school until they have completely recovered.

Schools are reminded to follow theGuidelines on Prevention of Communicable Diseaseson preventive and control measures as well as management of outbreaks. If an outbreak is suspected, schools should immediatelyreport itto the CHP for prompt follow-up. Schools may also refer to the CHP's pages onCF, DF,seasonal influenza,HFMD and EV71 infectionfor more information. Information on SIV is available on the CHP'sVaccination Schemes page."
Construction Safety Week 2025 promotes site safety (with photos),2025-08-25 19:22,2025-08-25 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500710.htm,"Construction Safety Week (CSW) 2025, themed ""Smart and Care, Safety Beyond Compare"", and co-organised by the Development Bureau and the Construction Industry Council (CIC), is being held from today (August 25) to August 29. An array of events, including the CSW Conference, an exhibition, site visits, and the award presentation ceremony of the 31st Considerate Contractors Site Award Scheme, are organised to enhance the awareness of site safety among the construction industry.

Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, the Secretary for Development, MsBernadette Linn, explained the principles for promoting site safety with the three virtues of ""wisdom, humanity and courage"" mentioned in the Analects of Confucius. ""Wisdom"": the Government has been committed to promoting the application of innovative technologies and smart site safety in recent years, while vigorously driving the full adoption of the Smart Site Safety System (4S) to bring revolutionary changes to the construction industry. Over 600 public and private construction sites have been awarded the 4S label so far. ""Humanity"": the industry must uphold a caring spirit that is people oriented, caring for the welfare of site personnel and creating a safer working environment and better development opportunities for them to give workers and their family members peace of mind. ""Courage"": site safety is everyone's responsibility. Industry stakeholders should actively fulfil their safety responsibilities, and nurture a positive and strong culture of site safety, demonstrating the courage to make commitments and rectifications.

The Chairman of the CIC, Professor Thomas Ho, stressed that site safety is the cornerstone of the construction industry, based on the principle that site safety is everyone's responsibility. He reiterated that all stakeholders should play their part and jointly inherit the craftsman spirit of Master Lo Pan to build a safer, wiser and brighter future.

The CSW Conference commenced right after the kick-off ceremony. Experts and project teams shared with the audience their experiences in adopting the 4S, uplifting site safety and nurturing a caring culture. An exhibition on the 4S was also held at the venue.

CSW, launched in 2012, aims to promote zero accidents and a caring environment in the construction industry. The campaign has received support from various sectors of the community including professional groups, organisations, trade associations and labour unions. Details of this year's CSW are available at www.safetyweek.hk."

Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for possessing and dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and importing alternative smoking products (with photo),2025-08-25 18:50,2025-08-25 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500653.htm,"âTwo incoming male passengers were both sentenced to five months and two weeks' imprisonment and fined $1,500 at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (August 25) for possessing and dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, as well as for importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance and the Import and Export Ordinance.

Customs officers intercepted two incoming male passengers, aged 31 and 36, at Hong Kong International Airport on June 26. About 14 500 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes, 122 400 alternative smoking products and four alternative smoking product devices were seized from their personal baggages. The total estimated market value was about $433,000, and the total duty potential was about $48,000. They were subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Under the Import and Export Ordinance, a person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況（附圖）,2025-08-25 18:49,2025-08-25 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500657.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月二十五日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然本港已連續10天沒有新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，但夏季溫度及雨量處於高水平，令多種蚊傳疾病在香港，以至全球爆發的風險持續。市民不能掉以輕心，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。」

本港今年至今累計錄得九宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案。

徐樂堅醫生補充說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月十七日至二十三日）廣東省新增336宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別為1 387宗（八月三日至九日）及830宗（八月十日至十六日）明顯減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然如此，我們仍不能掉以輕心，必須繼續多管齊下，避免出現本地傳播。由於新學年即將開始，中心於今日再次發信予學校，呼籲他們按照食物環境衞生署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，務必提醒教職員及學生，應時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。」

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並已於病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever (with photo),2025-08-25 18:49,2025-08-25 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500659.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 25), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

""Although there have been no new imported cases of CF in the past 10 consecutive days, high temperatures and rainfall levels continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world. Members of the public must remain vigilant and take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

 So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of nine confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases.

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 336 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (August 17 to 23), a significant decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 1 387 cases (August 3 to 9) and 830 cases (August 10 to 16) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. However, we must remain vigilant and continue to adopt a multipronged approach to prevent local transmissions. As the new school year is about to begin, the CHP today issued a letter to schools again, urging them to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. They should also remind the staff members and students to enact mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus,"" Dr Tsui added.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and has intensified mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public to adopt precautions during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;

律政司副司長出席香港國際申訴專員學院揭幕禮暨調解研討會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-08-25 18:40,2025-08-25 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500674.htm,"​以下是律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（八月二十五日）在香港國際申訴專員學院揭幕禮暨調解研討會的閉幕致辭：

尊敬的陳積志申訴專員、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。首先再次祝賀香港國際申訴專員學院今日正式成立，為政府及公營機構提供適切培訓，提升公署員工的專業能力，並且促進公署與海外申訴機構的交流和合作。剛才我出發前留意到有關今日這個活動的新聞，其中所報道的一點是專員指，學院不需額外撥款。

申訴專員擔當監察政府的角色，以確保香港的公共行政公平和有效率。公署的調查強調獨立、客觀和公正，所以每當市民遇到政府部門和公營機構行政失當時，往往第一時間都會找申訴專員擊鼓鳴冤。因此，申訴專員公署的工作的確提高了香港特區公共行政的質素和水平，促進了行政公平，是不少海外申訴機構學習和交流的對象。而近年，公署在應用調解處理申訴更可以說是成績斐然。

事實上，特區政府一直推廣調解，舉例來說，二○二三及二○二四年《施政報告》均特別提及深化調解文化的政策措施，可見特區政府對推動調解的重視。

我很高興今日的研討會以「正面看申訴、調解我有道」為主題，探討政府部門如何正面處理申訴，由部門首長和調解專家剛才向大家分享調解如何將投訴「轉危為機」。相信大家能透過今日的研討會加深對調解的認識，了解調解在公共服務領域的巨大潛力。

香港作爲「調解之都」，調解與我們的生活息息相關。為進一步推動調解，律政司已於二○二四年十一月六日發表了有關在政府合約中加入調解條款的政策宣言。調解條款表示當事人同意在訴諸仲裁或訴訟前先使用調解作為爭議解決途徑。有關政策其實已於今年二月六日起正式生效，在此感謝各部門和同事對政策的支持。

律政司同時亦致力向政府同事和社區推廣調解文化。為提高政府內部對調解的認識，律政司聯同公務員學院，於今年年初為政府部門提供調解培訓，內容涵蓋政府合約調解條款政策、調解基礎知識和法律框架。

在社區方面，律政司聯同環境及生態局和食物環境衞生署推出為期兩年的「社區調解先導計劃」，旨在透過培訓物業管理人員深入了解調解在解決爭議方面的價值，以及使他們掌握調解技能以解決在大廈管理當中的日常糾紛。提高社區工作者的調解技巧並推動他們將調解應用於日常工作，能建立公眾對調解的認知和信心，令調解文化真正可以植根社區。計劃自啓動以來，已成功於七月份舉辦兩場培訓，共有47名物業管理人員完成有關培訓。我們計劃在明年三月前再舉辦多四次同樣的培訓課程。

此外，在特區政府積極推進和各方配合下，國際調解院總部大樓已於今年八月一日正式交付國際調解院籌備辦公室，為國際調解院成立和開幕作好準備。律政司將全力支持國際調解院未來的工作，相信國際調解院的成立可與香港法律樞紐內多個相關區域或國際組織發揮協同效應，鞏固香港在國家「十四五」規劃下作為亞太區國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的定位，為國家涉外法治及推進粵港澳大灣區建設和「一帶一路」等國家戰略作出貢獻。

調解和申訴關係非常密切，環環相扣。申訴專員公署的三大策略性方向之一，是「優先採用調解方式處理不涉及或只涉及輕微行政失當的投訴個案」。

據我「偷師」了解所得，申訴專員公署的調查人員會以中立調解員及協調人的身分，透過會面或電話協助申訴人及被申訴機構討論問題、澄清誤解、收窄歧見，並尋找可行方案，和平地解決申訴，最終達成雙方願意接受的協議。

我亦知道公署在二○二四／二五年度以調解方式完成的個案達555宗，比上一年度增加接近三倍，創下歷史新高。事實證明，調解以非對抗態度解決問題，能有效處理不涉及或只涉及輕微行政失當的申訴個案，有助達致雙贏局面。

在進行全面調查前先嘗試調解，和律政司「調解為先」的理念可謂不謀而合。除了在政府合約中加入調解條款，各位都可以以個人或所屬機構身分加入我們「調解為先」的行列。律政司在二○○九年推出「調解為先」承諾書運動，提倡先採用調解來解決爭議。承諾書雖然不具法律約束力，但是承諾人承諾先探索採用調解解決爭議，然後才嘗試其他方法解決爭議，如在法庭進行訴訟。目前，已有超過1 000間公司、組織、聯會及個人簽署「調解為先」承諾書。

每兩年一度舉辦的「調解為先」承諾書活動於今年五月九日舉行，律政司很榮幸邀請到陳專員出席，並透過主題演講解說調解如何有效解決申訴及推廣正面申訴文化。

如果你還未簽署「調解為先」承諾書，現在是個好機會，詳情可瀏覽律政司網頁。遞交網上版承諾書後可立即成為承諾人，期待在下屆「調解為先」承諾書活動見到各位。

最後，我想為今日的活動作兩點的總結。第一，今日香港國際申訴專員學院的成立，有如廉政學院和律政司的國際法律人才培訓學院一樣，將會促進香港和國際交往合作，說好香港故事。

第二，我更期待社會各界能夠學習申訴專員公署在「調解為先」的成功經驗，一同嘗試以調解化解矛盾，以實現共贏。謝謝大家。"

  The opening ceremony of the Hong Kong International Ombudsman Academy (HKIOA), along with a seminar themed ""Nurturing a Positive Complaint Culture through Mediation"", was held at the Hong Kong Productivity Council today (August 25).

  The ceremony was officiated by the Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan; the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki; the Chairman of the Legislative Council House Committee, Dr Starry Lee; and the Director-General of the Department of Law of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Mr Liu Chunhua.

  In his speech, Mr Chan Kwok-ki stressed the HKSAR Government's endorsement and support for the founding vision of the HKIOA, which not only offers training to government departments and public organisations to enhance public administration, but also serves as an exchange platform with ombudsman institutions worldwide in line with the policy objectives of the current-term Government. Mediation was highlighted as a strategy for dispute resolution, with its growing prominence in fostering a more harmonious and stable society. He also acknowledged the Office of The Ombudsman (Office)'s contributions to promoting excellence in public administration, and encouraged all public officers to embrace a positive complaint culture and contribute to the collective efforts of building a better Hong Kong.

  In his welcoming remarks, Mr Jack Chan applauded the establishment of the HKIOA as a new chapter in the Office's efforts to promote good public administration. The initiative aims to create an interactive platform that fosters both internal and external exchange through seminars and workshops, etc. The HKIOA is also positioned to deepen and advance the Office's three strategic focuses: (1) enhancing mediation to resolve public complaints efficiently for win-win results; (2) vigorously fostering interdepartmental collaboration; and (3) promoting a positive complaint culture, which are pursued in response to the motherland's expectations for the HKSAR to stay bold in reform, dare to break new ground, and innovate continuously. The Office has leveraged its internal resources to establish the HKIOA, without seeking additional funding from the Government. All functions are undertaken by existing staff concurrently with their regular duties, showcasing a new approach for ""implementing new initiatives without requiring extra manpower"". Expressing his gratitude to the Chief Executive for supporting and recognising the Office's work, and to the Chief Secretary for Administration for officiating at the opening ceremony, as well as to government departments and public organisations for their co-operation over the years, Mr Jack Chan appealed to all to support the HKIOA's development, join forces to strengthen the management and efficiency of public services, and demonstrate the will and commitment to promote good governance.

  The seminar themed ""Nurturing a Positive Complaint Culture through Mediation"" was hosted by Assistant Ombudsman Mr Kenny Tang. Guest speakers included the Deputy Director of Leisure and Cultural Services (Leisure Services), Miss Winnie Chui; the Deputy Commissioner for Transport/Transport Services and Management, Ms Candy Kwok; the Deputy Director of Housing (Estate Management), Mr Michael Hong; and two advisers from the Office. They shared insights and discussed the application of mediation in complaint handling, covering mediation techniques, practical experiences and forward-looking ideas. Over 250 participants attended the seminar, including Legislative Council members and representatives from nearly 100 government departments and public organisations. Valuable perspectives and experiences were actively shared among them during the question-and-answer session.

  As the seminar drew to a close, the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, offered a thought-provoking summary in his keynote speech. The whole event concluded with a group photo, featuring Mr Jack Chan, Dr Cheung and other distinguished guests."

開學在即　衞生防護中心提醒學校採取措施預防疾病傳播,2025-08-25 17:40,2025-08-25 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500581.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月二十五日）透過教育局去信全港學校，呼籲校方積極採取措施，預防各種傳染病（尤其是蚊傳疾病）在學校傳播，以保障學生健康。

 中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「鑑於不少學校下星期將開學，中心今日向全港中小學、幼稚園及幼兒中心發信，提醒他們目前本港蚊傳疾病（例如基孔肯雅熱及登革熱）的風險，除了蚊傳疾病外，本地季節性流感、呼吸道合胞病毒及手足口病的活躍程度近一兩個月均有所上升。校方應提高警覺和經常進行清潔消毒，以減低傳染病在校內傳播的風險。」

他同時呼籲學生和老師，若出現發燒、呼吸道病徵、腹瀉、嘔吐或皮疹等，應立即求醫，切勿到學校上課或上班。

 以下是蚊傳疾病、呼吸道傳染病和手足口病近期在本港的活躍程度和預防方法：

甲、基孔肯雅熱及登革熱

基孔肯雅熱是一種由基孔肯雅病毒引起，經蚊子傳播的傳染病。基孔肯雅熱主要病徵有發燒和嚴重關節痛，其他病徵包括出疹、肌肉痛、頭痛、噁心和疲倦。症狀一般持續數天，大部分患者可以完全痊癒，但有些患者的關節痛可能會持續數月。由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，但一些高危群組包括幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒），感染基孔肯雅熱後較大機會引起併發症。截至今日，衞生防護中心今年共錄得九宗基孔肯雅熱個案，全部為外地傳入個案。

登革熱是一種由登革熱病毒引起的急性發熱疾病，病徵包括高燒、嚴重頭痛、眼窩後疼痛、出疹、肌肉及關節痛。初次感染病情一般較輕，但若隨後再感染其他血清型的登革熱病毒，則較大機會出現重症登革熱，可引致血液循環系統衰竭、休克，甚至死亡。截至八月二十一日，衞生防護中心今年共錄得41宗登革熱個案，全部為外地傳入個案。

這些蚊傳疾病不會人傳人，但學校應採取措施，加強防止積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，例如每星期最少替植物換水一次、緊蓋所有貯水容器和保持所有渠道暢通等。學校管理層亦應安排員工專責校園內的防治蚊患工作，詳情可參閱食物環境衞生署出版的指引。

乙、呼吸道傳染病

中心最新的監測數據顯示，本地季節性流感活躍程度由在七月中開始出現緩慢上升的趨勢。其他呼吸道病原體方面，呼吸道合胞病毒的活躍程度自六月起亦出現緩慢上升，預計活躍程度會維持一段時間。整體而言，醫院管理局收集的兒童呼吸道樣本中呼吸道病原體以鼻病毒／腸病毒和呼吸道合胞病毒較為活躍。參考過往的監測數據，新學期開始後，隨着天氣逐漸轉涼，學校內呼吸道傳染病爆發的呈報可能會增多，而新冠和流感的活躍程度或會於年底或明年初上升。

接種流感疫苗是預防流感的第一道防線，可降低感染後出現嚴重併發症和死亡的機會。中心建議家長在新學年安排子女參與季節性流感疫苗學校外展活動或到家庭醫生接種流感疫苗，以加強個人保護。研究顯示，兒童接種流感疫苗可以減少缺課。家長須留意接種疫苗後需約兩星期讓體內產生足夠抗體對抗流感，所以應於踏入冬季前及早接種。衞生署早前已致函通知全港所有學校有關二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃之安排，絕大部分學校亦已積極響應。根據本地經驗，學校參與外展疫苗接種計劃能顯著提高學童流感疫苗接種率逾一倍，有效加強學童免疫屏障。仍未參加的學校應盡快報名。

此外，要預防呼吸道傳染病，市民應時刻保持個人、手部和環境衞生。出現呼吸道感染病徵的學生／教職員，即使症狀輕微，都應佩戴外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，並應盡早向醫生求診，而佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後要保持手部衞生。

丙、手足口病

手足口病是一種常見於兒童的疾病，通常由腸病毒如柯薩奇病毒和腸病毒71型引起。香港手足口病和腸病毒71型感染的高峰期一般為五月至七月，而剛開學後的十月至十二月亦可能出現較小型的高峰期。今年六月至八月，部分監察手足口病的指標有上升趨勢。截至八月二十一日，衞生防護中心今年共錄得79宗在學校發生的手足口病爆發個案。

手足口病主要透過接觸患者的鼻或喉嚨分泌物、唾液、穿破的水疱或糞便，或觸摸受污染的物件而傳播。感染手足口病的兒童應留在家中，直至病癒才可回校上課，以免在校園出現傳播。

衞生防護中心提醒學校，按照「預防傳染病指引」執行防控措施和處理爆發個案，如懷疑出現爆發個案，應立即呈報衞生防護中心盡快跟進。學校亦可參閱衞生防護中心基孔肯雅熱、登革熱、季節性流感、手足口病及腸病毒71型感染網頁，了解詳情。有關流感疫苗接種的資訊，請參閱衞生防護中心疫苗接種計劃專頁。"

李家超感謝國家科學技術部一直大力支持香港特區政府、香港高等院校和在港實驗室的工作。他表示，獲得國家科技部批准成為全國重點實驗室，證明團隊在基礎研究、技術創新、關鍵核心技術攻關，具備一流水平。

他續說：「在『一國兩制』下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，積極擔當國家和全球之間『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的角色。在香港的全國重點實驗室將提供重要平台，促進與海內外的頂尖大學和科研機構合作，匯聚全球各地的優秀科研人員，助力打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地。」

在二○一八年，科技部同意內地國家重點實驗室設於香港的夥伴實驗室正名為國家重點實驗室。為配合國家整體發展規劃，創新科技署在二○二三年年底啓動了國家重點實驗室的重組工作。科技部在二○二五年一月批准15所香港的實驗室重組為全國重點實驗室，並且已於二○二五年七月一日正式運作。"
Plaque Presentation Ceremony for State Key Laboratories in Hong Kong held today in recognition of achievements in scientific research (with photos),2025-08-25 17:30,2025-08-25 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500573.htm,"  The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, witnessed the presentation of plaques to 15 State Key Laboratories (SKLs) in Hong Kong by the Minister of Science and Technology, Mr Yin Hejun, during a presentation ceremony today (August 25). The Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Zhou Ji, also attended the ceremony.

  Before the ceremony, Mr Lee met with Mr Yin to exchange in-depth views on deepening the research and development collaboration between the Mainland and Hong Kong. The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong; the Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry,Ms Lillian Cheong; and the Commissioner for Innovation and Technology, Mr Ivan Lee, were also present at the plaque presentation ceremony and the meeting.

  Mr Lee expressed his gratitude to the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) for its unfailing support for the work of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, higher education institutions and SKLs in Hong Kong. He said that having been accredited the status of SKL by the MOST, these labs demonstrated their world-class capabilities in basic research, technological innovation, and the development of key core technologies.

  ""Under the principle of 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the advantage of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world and actively plays the role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder'. The SKLs in Hong Kong serve as an important platform for bringing together outstanding researchers from all over the world by establishing partnerships with top universities and research institutions at home and abroad, helping to build Hong Kong into a hub for international high-end talent.""

  The MOST agreed in 2018 that Partner SKLs in Hong Kong that were paired up with SKLs on the Mainland could be renamed as SKLs. To align with the overall national development plan, the ITC initiated the restructuring exercise of the SKLs in Hong Kong in late 2023. The MOST approved the restructuring of 15 SKLs in Hong Kong in January 2025. These SKLs have come into operation since July 1, 2025."

​法庭使用者可使用「綜合法院案件管理系統」處理高等法院商業案件、建築及仲裁案件和知識產權案件,2025-08-25 16:59,2025-08-25 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500519.htm,"下稿代司法機構發出：

司法機構宣布，「綜合法院案件管理系統」由八月二十九日起將擴展至應用於高等法院原訟法庭的商業案件（案件類別簡稱為HCCL）、建築及仲裁案件（案件類別簡稱為HCCT），以及知識產權案件（案件類別簡稱為HCIP），法庭使用者可透過該系統以電子模式處理文件和繳付款項。

「綜合法院案件管理系統」是一個方便、一站式和全天候的系統，目的是便利法庭使用者隨時隨地以電子方式處理或存檔法庭文件和繳付款項。系統現正分階段推展至各級法院，提供的主要電子服務包括向法院送交及從法院接收案件特定的法庭文件、查閱或翻查已存檔文件和法院持有的其他案件資料、翻查訟案登記冊，以及繳付各類法院服務收費。

「綜合法院案件管理系統」現時應用於區域法院的傷亡訴訟、稅款申索、民事訴訟和僱員補償案件、裁判法院的傳票案件、小額錢債審裁處的批量申索案件，以及高等法院上訴法庭的民事上訴案件（案件類別簡稱為CACV）。系統將繼續分階段推展至高等法院其他案件類別，包括由八月二十九日起應用於商業案件、建築及仲裁案件和知識產權案件。

司法機構指出，使用「綜合法院案件管理系統」以電子方式存檔或提交文件，一般無需再以紙本形式向法院存檔或提交該文件，大大提升效率。司法機構強烈建議訴訟方（尤其是律師行）在高等法院已開通電子系統的案件類別使用電子存檔，即民事上訴案件、商業案件、建築及仲裁案件和知識產權案件。法庭使用者使用「綜合法院案件管理系統」，無需前往法院大樓就存檔紙本文件上載掃描文件及繳付費用。

司法機構已主動聯絡處理相對較多民事上訴案件、商業案件、建築及仲裁案件和知識產權案件的律師行，提供針對性技術支援，以協助他們盡早由傳統的紙本方式轉用「綜合法院案件管理系統」。司法機構邀請所有該些律師行由八月二十九日起，在首次透過「綜合法院案件管理系統」為相關類別的案件開立檔案時，先預約司法機構為其代表提供特設的操作指導，地點可安排於高等法院大樓或其辦公室，協助他們試行以電子方式代替紙本方式立案，為未來強制使用作準備。司法機構同時歡迎任何律師行盡早向司法機構尋求相關協助。

為鼓勵法庭使用者轉用「綜合法院案件管理系統」，就主要或直接與以電子模式處理法庭文件有關的高等法院的費用項目，「綜合法院案件管理系統」使用者可獲八折優惠，為期三年。

合資格使用者須註冊開立用戶帳戶，以使用「綜合法院案件管理系統」提供的所有服務。合資格使用者包括正在進行或新的電子法律程序的訴訟各方及其法律代表（如有）、香港大律師公會、香港律師會、律師行、政府部門、執法機關，以及法定團體。註冊開立帳戶費用全免。

沒有註冊帳戶的市民也可使用「綜合法院案件管理系統」部分服務，這些服務主要與翻查可供公眾查閲的電子文件有關。

技術要求方面，法庭使用者只需透過具網絡連接功能及配置一般常用的操作系統和瀏覽器的個人電腦或流動裝置，便可登入「綜合法院案件管理系統」。

除卻系統維修保養期間，「綜合法院案件管理系統」全日24小時提供服務。法院登記處及會計部的一般辦公時間結束後（即工作天下午五時三十分後）經由「綜合法院案件管理系統」收到的電子存檔及電子支付，會被視為在登記處及會計部下一個工作天的一般辦公時間開始時收到。

在高等法院，任何訴訟方若選擇就已開通電子系統的案件類別以紙本形式存檔或提交文件，而非使用「綜合法院案件管理系統」，必須同時提供該文件的電子版本，以便建立和備存一套完整的電子存檔紀錄，供電子查閱之用。無律師代表訴訟人可使用設於高等法院大樓無律師代表訴訟人資源中心的自助服務站，掃描文件並上載至「綜合法院案件管理系統」。有律師代表的訴訟人（包括律師行）則須在法院大樓外自行備妥文件的電子版本，然後僅可使用自助服務站將已掃描的文件上載至「綜合法院案件管理系統」。就律師行而言，這是在二○二六年起強制使用「綜合法院案件管理系統」處理已開通電子模式的案件類別前的最後過渡安排。

"Court users may use integrated Court Case Management System for commercial cases, construction and arbitration cases, and intellectual property cases in High Court",2025-08-25 16:59,2025-08-25 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500525.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Judiciary:

 The Judiciary announced that starting from August 29, the integrated Court Case Management System (iCMS) will be extended to cover commercial cases (HCCL), construction and arbitration cases (HCCT), and intellectual property cases (HCIP) in the Court of First Instance of the High Court to allow court users to handle filing and payments electronically.

 Progressively implemented across various court levels, the iCMS aims to facilitate the electronic handling of court-related documents and payments, offering a convenient, all-in-one and all-weather solution for filing documents anytime, anywhere. Major electronic services include sending and receiving case-specific court documents to and from the courts, inspecting or searching filed documents and other case-related information held by the courts, searching cause books, and making payments for court services.

 The iCMS application currently covers personal injury actions, tax claim proceedings, civil action proceedings and employees' compensation cases in the District Court, summons cases in the Magistrates' Courts, bulk claims in the Small Claims Tribunal, and civil appeal cases (CACV) in the Court of Appeal of the High Court. It will then be extended incrementally to other case types in the High Court, including HCCL, HCCT and HCIP cases with effect from August 29.

  Using the iCMS obviates the need for court users to file or submit documents to the courts in paper form, providing convenience and enhancing efficiency for court users. Case parties, particularly law firms, are strongly encouraged to use e-filing for iCMS-enabled case types in the High Court, namely CACV, HCCL, HCCT and HCIP. With the iCMS, there is no need to visit the court building to upload scanned documents and make payments for paper filing.

 The Judiciary has been proactively reaching out to law firms that handle a relatively high volume of CACV, HCCL, HCCT and HCIP cases to offer dedicated technical support, with a view to facilitating their early migration from conventional paper mode to the iCMS. Specifically, from August 29, law firms are invited to make an appointment with the Judiciary for technical assistance on using the iCMS, either at the High Court Building or in their own offices, when they are initiating a new case of an iCMS-enabled case type for the first time. This aims to encourage them to try using e-filing (instead of paper filing) for case initiation in preparation for mandatory e-filing in future. The Judiciary also welcomes any law firms to approach it early for assistance in this regard.

 To encourage migration to the iCMS, a 20 per cent concession is offered to iCMS users for three years on fee items of the High Court that are primarily or directly related to the electronic handling of court documents.

 Eligible users need to register for a user account to access the full range of services under the iCMS. They include parties of ongoing or new e-proceedings and their legal representatives (if any), the Hong Kong Bar Association, the Law Society of Hong Kong, law firms, government departments, law enforcement agencies and statutory bodies. Registration is free of charge.

 Unregistered members of the public may also use certain types of iCMS services, mainly related to searching for electronic documents that are open to public inspection.

 Regarding technical requirements, the iCMS can be accessed using personal computers or mobile devices with an Internet connection, commonly used operating systems and browsers.

 The iCMS operates around the clock, except during system maintenance. Any e-filing and e-payment received under the iCMS after the registry and the accounts office are normally closed to the public (i.e. after 5.30pm on a working day) will be deemed to be received at the start of the normal opening hours of the registry and the accounts office on the following working day.

 In the High Court, any party choosing to file or submit a document in paper form (instead of using the iCMS) for an iCMS-enabled case type must also provide an electronic copy of the document to facilitate the creation and maintenance of a complete set of e-filing records for e-inspection. Litigants-in-person (LiPs) can use the self-service kiosks located at the Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants in the High Court Building to scan and upload their documents to the iCMS. Non-LiPs, including law firms, are required to prepare the electronic copy of their documents on their own (outside the court building) and then use the kiosks solely for uploading the scanned documents to the iCMS. For law firms, this is the final transitional arrangement before the mandatory use of the iCMS for case types where the electronic mode has been made available, starting in 2026.

 For more details about the iCMS, including its technical requirements, please visit the dedicated webpage on e-Courts of the Judiciary website atwww.judiciary.hk/en/e_courts/index.html.

 For enquiries, please call the general enquiry hotline at 2477 1002 or the technical helpline at 2886 6474, email to enquiry@judiciary.hk or visit the Help Centre at 5/F, Wanchai Tower, 12 Harbour Road, Wan Chai."
​政務司司長出席香港國際申訴專員學院揭幕禮暨調解研討會致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-08-25 16:57,2025-08-25 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500572.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（八月二十五日）出席香港國際申訴專員學院揭幕禮暨調解研討會的致辭：

尊敬的劉春華部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室法律部部長）、李慧琼主席（立法會內務委員會主席）、陳積志專員（申訴專員）、各位嘉賓、各位同事、各位朋友：

大家好！今日很高興出席由申訴專員公署舉辦的香港國際申訴專員學院揭幕禮暨調解研討會，與大家一起見證申訴專員公署的新一個里程碑。

自一九八九年成立以來，申訴專員公署一直擔當監察政府及主要公營機構的重要角色，透過獨立、客觀及公正的調查，提出務實、具建設性及可行的建議，致力推動高效和以民為本的公共服務。我衷心感謝公署對推動卓越公共行政所作的貢獻。

香港國際申訴專員學院的成立，不單為政府部門及公營機構提供培訓和分享經驗的平台，促進跨部門及跨機構的協作，亦進一步推動國際交流合作，透過互相分享經驗和工作模式，說好香港故事，並繼續發揮香港「背靠祖國，聯通世界」的角色，同時進一步提升香港的公共行政水平。本屆政府積極推動改革，致力提升公共服務和管治水平。學院的成立與本屆政府的施政理念一致，實在值得支持。

早前我亦問過專員學院的地址在哪裏，他說學院並無地址，而是在網上、是虛擬學院，亦不需要額外人手，而是利用公署自己的人手、並無增加。剛才專員亦說得很清楚，他是開創一個新的方法，就是增加新任務而不要求增加資源。作為一個在政府中參與負責分配資源的官員，我很讚賞他這種態度，我亦覺得這個態度是一個很好的示範作用。

完善的監察制度是社會進步的基石，公署的工作和政府的運作其實是相輔相成的。我感謝公署在社會層面推動正面和積極的申訴文化。市民的每一個意見，都是對公共服務的關注，同時亦是對我們工作的回應和期許。我勉勵所有公職人員以開放的態度看待申訴，將申訴轉化為前進的動力，共同建立一個更美好的香港。

除了調查申訴個案和進行主動調查行動外，申訴專員陳積志先生自上任以來，積極提倡優先採用調解方式處理不涉及或者只是涉及輕微行政失當的申訴。以調解解決爭議有助更有效和快速處理市民的申訴，這除了是大勢所趨，亦有助建設更和諧的社會。我覺得這個方法是非常好，因為剛才專員也說，很多投訴不是對與錯的問題，而是市民和政府部門，大家誤會了的問題、互相不了解的問題。所以透過一個調解的方法幫助市民，亦幫助市民更理解政府的工作、理解政府的困難。我相信政府亦可以在我們能夠運用的彈性下，幫助市民解決問題。我相信這個是很好的安排。

本屆政府亦致力推動調解，律政司在這方面做了大量工作，包括闡明政府就進一步推廣使用以調解方式解決爭議的政策立場和方向，以及檢視及強化規範香港調解專業認證和紀律事宜的制度。另外，律政司又與環境及生態局和食物環境衞生署合作，推出為期兩年的社區調解先導計劃，培訓物業管理人員處理社區常見的糾紛，例如滲水問題和鄰里摩擦等。大家都知道這些滲水問題或鄰里摩擦，有時是大家每人讓一步，總比打官司、上法庭解決好。雖然兩個都是解決方法，但我們相信如果能透過第三者，也透過例如我們幫手去解釋、或用一個調解的方式去解決他們的爭議，相信是最好的解決方法。

運用調解處理紛爭，可以廣泛應用在社會各個層面，提升效率之餘，更能切切實實為市民解決問題。我鼓勵各政府部門積極採用調解解決爭議，節省資源之餘，亦可以令整個社會更和諧、更祥和。

今天出席研討會的同事，很多都是在前線工作，當中亦包括主管級同事。我期望各位在堅守初心和使命的同時，要不斷學習和進步，為市民提供更到位、更貼心的服務。

最後，我再次祝賀香港國際申訴專員學院正式揭幕，希望學院順利展開工作，為提升本港公共行政服務水平注入新動力、新願景；亦祝願稍後進行的研討會圓滿成功，成果豐碩。多謝大家。"

"
DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-08-25 16:30,2025-08-25 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500457.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 25) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From August 17 to 23, the CHP recorded four community-acquired LD cases. All of the patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:


A 71-year-old male patient living in Eastern District;
A 55-year-old male patient living in Eastern District;
An 83-year-old female patient living in Sai Kung District; and
An 88-year-old female patient living in Sai Kung District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that all four cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of August 23, 111 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


  The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms.

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-08-25 16:30,2025-08-25 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500454.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（八月二十五日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在八月十七日至二十三日期間，衞生防護中心錄得四宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，全部病人均有長期病患。詳情如下：


71歲男病人，居於東區；
55歲男病人，居於東區；
83歲女病人，居於西貢區；及
88歲女病人，居於西貢區。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示四宗個案全部屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這些個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至八月二十三日，今年錄得111宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。

​
​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及

Reporter: I want to first ask about under the restructured State Key Laboratories (SKLs). How are Hong Kong's universities taking part in the overall technological development with the Mainland, and also with the assistance of the SKLs, what are some of the current projects that we expect to see in the near future?

Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry: The Ministry of Science and Technology of our country initiated the optimisation and restructuring exercise for the SKLs in 2022. In Hong Kong, we initiated such an exercise in late 2023, and eventually we have a total of 15 SKLs approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology. Among these 15 new SKLs, 12 are established based on the original ones, and three are completely new. All these 15 SKLs have come into operation on July 1 this year. We do wish that these new SKLs can better align with our national development plan, and better serve our national needs. And more importantly, we hope all of them can fully leverage on the advantage of internationalisation of Hong Kong, strengthen global research collaboration, and nurture and attract international talent, making contributions to develop a strong nation in science and technology, as well as building Hong Kong into an international I&T (innovation and technology) centre. Thank you.

創新科技及工業局局長：大家上午好。剛剛我們一起見證全國重點實驗室授牌儀式，我們非常榮幸請來國家科學技術部部長陰和俊遠道而來，為我們15所在港的全國重點實驗室頒授牌匾，同時特區政府行政長官李家超和中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室周霽主任也一同見證這個重要的時刻。

國家科技部從二○二二年開始對當時的國家重點實驗室進行了重組，重組之後更名為全國重點實驗室。特區政府從二○二三年年底開始啓動了重組工作，最終國家科技部‍批准15所在港的全國重點實驗室。這15所在港的全國重點實驗室，有12所是之前經過重組而產生，還有三所是全新的。15所全國重點實驗室今年七月一日開始已經正式投入運作。特區政府每年會對每一所全國重點實驗室提供2,000萬元的科研經費。我們希望重組後的15所全國重點實驗室能夠緊密對接國家的重大戰略需求，瞄準世界的科技前沿，同時大力提升科研水準。同時，我們也希望15所全國重點實驗室能夠充分發揮香港的國際化優勢，積極拓展全球的科研合作，同時能夠大力培養和吸引全世界的頂尖人才，為國家科技自立自強和建設香港國際創新科技中心貢獻力量。現在，我請盧煜明教授講幾句。

記者：想問局長，見到這批實驗室是為了配合國家整體發展規劃，可否跟我們分享一下，現在重點發展有哪些方向，這15間實驗室可以如何配合？第二，見到它們需要提交一個五年的工作時間表，是否這2,000萬資助的時限是批五年？之後會按甚麼標準去繼續批這些資助？最後想問問周主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任周霽）剛才也提到有一批創科專家會成為新香港人，可否跟我們舉例這批專家包含哪些人，以及希望他們未來對香港發展有哪些貢獻？另外，想問三大校長，這批實驗室需要提交一個五年的工作計劃，將來五年的發展方向是甚麼？KPI（關鍵績效指標）和如何用這些資助？

創新科技及工業局局長：大家看到我們這次授牌的15所在港全國重點實驗室所有的方向，都是緊密對接國家的重大需求，這裏面有生物醫藥、材料、電子、還有些農業的項目等等，也反映出香港過去這些年在相關領域取得了飛速的發展，得到了國家的認可。特區政府之前已經明確了訂下計劃，加強加大對每間在港全國重點實驗室的資助力度。現在是每年我們提供最多2,000萬元港幣。各個實驗室都會提交具體的工作計劃和財務報告，去確保2,000萬元用得其所。當然我們也希望15所全國重點實驗室，以及在港其他一些科研機構，能夠成為吸引和培育國際頂尖人才的重要平台。實際上，我們這三位大學的校長也是三所在港全國重點實驗室的主任，他們在這方面應該有更深刻的體會。我現在就把時間交給三位，再結合你剛才第二個問題，他們一一作答。

記者：想問局長，剛才科技部部長亦有提到香港科學界要勇於去突破科技界的一些「無人區」，你認為有甚麼前沿領域可以，如何鼓勵院校去進行一些科技研究？在資源共享方面，剛才盧校長都有提到會多用大灣區的臨床資源，可否說一下有甚麼，例如「數據過河」或者生物資源共享方面，有甚麼可以在實驗室「開綠燈」？

創新科技及工業局局長：謝謝這位記者的問題。大家注意到我們這次新增的一所全國重點實驗室，是來自中文大學的量子信息實驗室，量子科學體現了其中一個未來發展的前沿。同時大家注意到我們15所（全國重點實驗室）裏面有相當多的都是建於生命健康、生物醫藥，包括旁邊兩位的傑出科學家，這也反映出香港在生命健康領域有很強大的基礎科研和突破能力。最近一段時間，國家明確提出了生物醫藥作為一個國家的發展產業，我們強勁的基礎科研實力也可以緊密對接國家的重大需求。今天上午在跟陰部長座談的時候，很多在港的科學家都提出，我們要加大跨境創新要素的流動，特別是科研數據的共享。陰部長表示，他們會回去一定要專門討論這個問題，怎麼樣使得我們香港很強的科研力量，能夠充分利用兩地的一些資源優勢、信息優勢，能夠更好地發揮作用等等。我不知道其他校長還有沒有再進一步補充。

發展局局長出席「建造業安全周2025」開幕典禮暨研討會致辭（只有中文）,2025-08-25 12:13,2025-08-25 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/25/P2025082500305.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（八月二十五日）在「建造業安全周2025」開幕典禮暨研討會的致辭全文：

建造業議會主席何安誠教授、建造業議會建造安全專責委員會主席王紹恆先生、建造業議會執行總監Albert（鄭定寕）、各位業界朋友、各位傳媒朋友：

看到的確很多業界朋友都在場，不同階層、不同職系的朋友都在，顯示大家對建造安全的重視。每一次來到這個大會都提醒我們時間真的過得很快，一年又過去，我們每一年都舉辦「建造業安全周」。為何年復年都要舉辦，正正提醒我們每個人工地安全的重要。

今年的主題是「智愛˙盡責」，結合了科技的力量、對彼此的關愛，以及工地安全人人有責的理念。在此我想與大家分享儒家經典《論語》中提到的「智、仁、勇」三種修養。孔子曾說：「智者不惑，仁者不憂，勇者不懼。」這三種品格相輔相成，不僅是君子的品格，亦是我們在追求工地安全中不可或缺的原則，亦與我們今年的主題「智愛˙盡責」同出一轍。

首先談談「智」。「智」，大家都知道是智慧，其實除了我們人類思考很多人生哲理、處事方法的智慧，亦告訴我們要善用創新科技，因為創新科技可以進一步提高人類的智慧。政府近年致力推動創新科技應用和工地安全智能化，包括「組裝合成」建築法（MiC）、機電裝備合成法（MiMEP）和裝配式設計（DfMA）等先進高效建築方法，幫助我們將一些高危的現場建築工序轉移到廠房進行。而建築信息模擬技術（BIM）亦讓工地人員可在三維虛擬環境中進行設計、溝通和協作。

可能大家都感受到，也希望大家感受到，政府在過去一年大力推動整個建造業界，不論是工務工程或私人發展項目，鼓勵和協助他們全面應用「安全智慧工地」系統（4S），為建造業帶來創造性變革，讓4S系統成為工地的標誌，亦進一步加強工地安全管理。在這方面我們透過不同的鼓勵措施和提供資助推動建造業界加快步伐應用4S，而除了鼓勵和推動，我們亦有強制。去年屋宇署已就私人發展項目，如使用流動機械和塔式起重機，必定要為這些機械採用4S裝置，適用範圍包括上蓋結構工程、拆卸工程、挖掘及橫向支撐工程、地基工程及工地平整工程。我們亦在短時間內加強這個強制措施的適用範圍，起初由新入則的圖則開始，後來即使是圖則已經在我們引入強制措施前獲批，但如果未開工，在開工時我們也加入這個強制要求，可見我們對這個措施的重視。

我們亦透過建造業創科基金在去年九月至十一月將合資格申請安裝這些系統的資助，擴展至這些機械的租賃公司，至今已成功推動了超過八成半參與公私營工程的流動機械和塔式起重機的擁有人申請基金安裝有關警報系統。

透過不同的措施，推動業界積極廣泛使用4S，其中一個績效指標就是去年推出的4S標籤計劃，至今已有超過600個工地地盤獲得4S標籤。我很高興每一次出席活動都與大家分享這數字，節節上升。我記得上一次出席活動我仍說有500個左右，現時可與大家說，超過600個工地地盤獲得4S標籤，大家不怕去標籤，還爭取這個標籤，當中包括全港約七成的公私營新建工程工地，所以我在此再一次呼籲各位業界朋友，讓這個數字再節節上升。

​ 剛才講完「智」，現在與大家談談「仁」。「仁」是仁愛，是我們對生命的關懷與顧己及人的精神。在工地環境，仁愛意味着關愛工友，互相提醒，共同建立一種彼此守望相助的工地安全文化。我相信當每個人都將安全放在第一位，關心我們的工地人員的福祉，我們的地盤工作一定會更加暢順，一定讓大家更有獲得感。工友是建造業最寶貴的資源，他們竭力參與各項建設，為香港繁榮昌盛作出非凡貢獻。我們有責任為他們營造更安全的工作環境、更好的發展機遇，讓他們能夠安心工作、平安回家。為推動建造業持續發展，我們必須秉持這份「以人為本」的精神，繼續秉持「沒有最安全，只有更安全」這個理念。

「智、仁、勇」，接下來希望與大家談談「勇」。「勇」是勇敢，是我們面對挑戰時無畏的精神，包含勇於承擔責任的決心，亦包含勇於指正。「工地安全、人人有責」。工地安全的責任不只屬於某個建造業的持份者，而是整個工程團隊每一位成員都有大家各自的角色和責任。我們必須培養正向、堅實、勇於承擔的工地安全文化，切勿、不可以讓冒險及走捷徑的心態萌芽，讓整個團隊內每個成員都擁有正確的價值觀。我們希望藉着「建造業安全周」這個年度活動，進一步凝聚全個業界各個層面，激勵各持份者，包括政府部門、整個業界每一個持份者，包括業主、專業人士、承建商、分包商、供應商和前線工地人員，大家都能夠積極履行這份對於安全負上的責任。在工地人員層面，我很高興建造業議會與業界各方牽頭於今年四月，即數個月前，推出了「前線人員安全表現紀錄計劃」。即除了我們去年引進的，就地盤負責人希望他們安裝4S標籤，我們再走進去每一個前線工友，引入了這個「前線人員安全表現紀錄計劃」。在短短數個月間，已有約700個工地地盤和約三萬個工友參與計劃。計劃能讓前線人員了解清楚自身的安全責任，並提醒累計積分出現不安全行為的人員接受特定安全訓練，提醒要為自己以及身邊工友的安全「盡責」。

​最後，我想感謝每一位為工地安全付出努力的同仁，是你們的「智、仁、勇」，讓我們的工作環境變得更加安全，而這份「智、仁、勇」精神亦與建造業議會Thomas主席所倡議的「匠人精神」可說是相輔相成。希望大家在接下來的一星期，積極參與各項工地安全推廣活動，互勉提升安全意識，共同打造一個更安全、更和諧的工作環境。讓我們共同邁向「仁者不憂，智者不惑，勇者不懼」的理想境界。

我亦想在這裏藉業界代表今日聚首一堂的機會，作出一個小小的呼籲，九月七日下星期日，將會是選舉委員會界別舉行分組補選的日子。大家都知道選舉委員會界別是特區選舉制度重要的組成部分，由社會各界代表組成，而這次補選其中一個界別就是與大家非常有關係的「建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界」，我希望合資格的選民，大家到時踴躍投票。

最後在「建造業安全周」再次提醒我們每一個人「建造安全，人人有責」。謝謝大家！"
