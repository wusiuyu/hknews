衞生防護中心調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案,2025-12-20 20:45,2025-12-20 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000757.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十日）正調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案，同時提醒市民時刻注意個人和環境衞生，以減低被傳染這種嚴重疾病的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的30歲男子，他於十二月十八日開始出現發燒、全身乏力及嘔吐，昨日（十二月十九日）到仁濟醫院急症室求醫，需留院治療。病人其後曾出現神智模糊及失語，現時情況穩定。他的腦脊液樣本經化驗後，證實對腦膜炎雙球菌呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為腦膜炎。

初步調查顯示，病人潛伏期內沒有外遊，他的家居接觸者至今沒有出現病徵。中心會向其密切接觸者派發預防性藥物並繼續進行調查。

侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染是法定須呈報傳染病。計及上述個案，中心今年錄得11宗個案。

腦膜炎雙球菌感染是由腦膜炎雙球菌所引起，主要經由直接接觸帶菌者的呼吸道分泌物（包括口鼻分泌物）而傳播。當細菌入侵血液（腦膜炎雙球菌血症）或包圍腦部及脊髓的內膜（流行性腦膜炎）時，可引致嚴重病症。腦膜炎雙球菌血症的病徵包括突發性發燒、劇烈頭痛、皮膚出現瘀斑及休克，嚴重者甚至會致命。流行性腦膜炎的病徵包括發高燒、劇烈頭痛、頸部僵硬及嗜睡，亦會有嘔吐、畏光或皮疹等情況出現，若情況嚴重更可造成腦部損害或死亡。

中心呼籲市民採取以下預防措施以預防腦膜炎雙球菌感染：


用梘液和清水正確洗手，尤其在雙手被呼吸道分泌物污染時，如打噴嚏後。當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，可用酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應掩着口鼻，用紙巾包裹痰涎，棄置於有蓋的垃圾桶內，並即時洗手；
避免到人多擠迫的地方；
避免與出現發燒或劇烈頭痛病徵的病人作親密接觸；
前往高危地區前，應諮詢醫生有關接種腦膜炎雙球菌疫苗的詳情；及
從高危地區返港後若感到不適，應立即求診，並告知醫生近期曾到訪的地區。


市民可參閱衞生防護中心網頁以取得更多有關腦膜炎雙球菌感染的資料。"
CHP investigates case of invasive meningococcal infection,2025-12-20 20:45,2025-12-20 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000755.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (December 20) is investigating a case of invasive meningococcal infection, and reminds the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of contracting this serious disease.

  The case involves a 30-year-old male with good past health. He presented with a fever, malaise and vomiting on December 18. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital yesterday (December 19) and was admitted for treatment. The patient subsequently developed confusion and loss of speech. He is now in a stable condition. His cerebrospinal fluid specimen tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was meningitis.

  An initial investigation revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. His household contact has remained asymptomatic so far. The CHP will distribute preventive drugs to his close contacts and will continue the investigation.

  Meningococcal infection is a statutory notifiable disease. Including this case, the CHP has recorded 11 cases this year.

  Meningococcal infection is caused by a bacterium known as meningococcus. It is mainly transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, of infected persons. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream (meningococcaemia) or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord (meningococcal meningitis). Meningococcaemia is characterised by a sudden onset of fever, an intense headache, purpura, shock and even death in severe cases. Meningococcal meningitis is characterised by high fever, severe headache, stiff neck followed by drowsiness, vomiting, fear of bright light, or rash; it can cause brain damage or even death.

  To prevent meningococcal infection, members of the public are advised to take the following measures:


Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly, especially when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing, and clean hands with alcohol-based handrub when they are not visibly soiled;
Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, hold the saliva with a tissue, dispose of nasal and mouth discharge in a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands immediately;
Avoid crowded places;
Avoid close contact with patients who have a fever or severe headache;
Consult doctors about meningococcal vaccination before travelling to high-risk areas; and
Seek medical advice if you become ill after returning from high-risk areas, and discuss your recent travel history with your doctor.

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-20 20:40,2025-12-20 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000766.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.7 billion as of noon today (December 20). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $4 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

  Currently, there is still a supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer-term accommodation. The transitional housing and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects in different districts can altogether provide around 500 units at the moment. Moreover, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

  As of this morning, a total of 581 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 559 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 513 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the HKHS or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received around 2 000 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 29 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Handling of reported missing persons
------------------------------------------

  The forensic pathologist recently discovered, through scientific examination, that one set of human remains actually belongs to two deceased individuals. As a result, the number of deceased has increased to 161. Relevant forensic identification work is still in progress.

  In addition, the six missing person cases being followed up by the Casualty Enquiry Unit earlier have all been concluded. Five of the individuals died in the fire, while the remaining one passed away in 2023. In view of the latest situation, the Police will adjust the service hours of its casualty enquiry hotline for the Tai Po fire (1878 999) to 7am to 11pm daily starting from tomorrow (December 21).

Investigation and regulation
-------------------------------

  Relevant policy bureaux and departments continue to follow up on the fire investigation and regulatory efforts.

Others
--------

 Due to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the school premises of Tai Po Baptist Public School will remain closed for a period of time. To enable all students of the school to continue their studies in a stable and continuous learning environment as early as possible, and to further safeguard students’ well-being, following discussions between the Education Bureau and relevant government departments, the school premises of the former Church of Christ in China Kei Ching Primary School (originally planned to be converted into an integrated social service complex) will be allocated to Tai Po Baptist Public School for use as its school premises from the 2026/27 school year, allowing all classes to resume normal teaching and learning activities at a single school site."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-20 17:30,2025-12-20 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000555.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 20), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-12-20 17:05,2025-12-20 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000495.htm,"âTwo incoming male passengers were both sentenced to 5 months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (December 20) for possession of dutiable cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

During an anti-illicit cigarette operation conducted by Customs officers and Customs detector dog at Hong Kong International Airport on December 18, two incoming male passengers, aged 30 and 35, were intercepted and about 99 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from their personal baggage, with an estimated market value of about $444,000 and a duty potential of about $326,000. The passengers were subsequently arrested. They were both sentenced to 5 months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

教育局發言人說：「為了讓大埔浸信會公立學校所有學生能盡快在一個持續而穩定的學習環境上課，進一步保障學生的福祉，經教育局積極與相關政府部門商討後，前基正小學（原計劃改建為綜合社會服務大樓）的校舍將分配給大埔浸信會公立學校於二○二六／二七學年起作校舍用途，讓該校所有班級均可在同一校舍恢復日常教學活動。」

教育局已成立工作小組，積極落實上述安排，並會繼續與學校保持緊密聯繫，提供適切的支援。"

  Due to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the school premises of Tai Po Baptist Public School will remain closed for a period of time. As a transitional measure, the EDB has arranged for students of Tai Po Baptist Public School to resume face-to-face classes by grade level at the school premises of Tai Po Government Primary School and NTWJWA Christian Remembrance of Grace Primary School respectively, from the 15th of this month until the end of the current school year.

ï»¿  A spokesperson for the EDB said, ""To enable all students of Tai Po Baptist Public School to continue their studies in a stable and continuous learning environment as early as possible, and to further safeguard students’ well-being, following discussions between the EDB and relevant government departments, the school premises of the former Kei Ching Primary School (originally planned to be converted into an integrated social service complex) will be allocated to Tai Po Baptist Public School for use as its school premises from the 2026/27 school year, allowing all classes to resume normal teaching and learning activities at a single school site.ï»¿""

  The EDB has set up a dedicated working group to implement the above arrangement. The EDB will continue to maintain close contact with the school and provide appropriate support."
Deputy Commissioner of Police encourages graduates to jointly safeguard Hong Kong citizens (with photos),2025-12-20 13:32,2025-12-20 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000305.htm,"The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Operations), Mr Yip Wan-lung, inspected the passing-out parade of 34 probationary inspectors and 187 recruit police constables at the Hong Kong Police College today (December 20), and witnessed them joining the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) to shoulder the noble mission of safeguarding Hong Kong and protecting citizens.

In his address, Mr Yip said that upon officially taking up frontline duties, graduates must bear in mind that they are not merely law enforcers, but also guardians ensuring a peaceful and safe living environment for the citizens. He hoped they would embody the professional spirit of ""going the extra mile"" and ""thinking more carefully and deeply"".

He highlighted that, in response to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po last month, various government units worked in concert to provide comprehensive support to affected victims throughout rescue and recovery efforts. The HKPF also mobilised a significant number of officers to assist in rescue operation and follow-up relief work, and conduct investigation.

He said police officers tried to promptly ascertain the status of missing persons for the distressed families, sparing them enduring regret. Professional investigation has been initiated with a view to holding those responsible accountable and upholding justice. Officers endured psychological stress in the search for bodies at the fire scene. They also maintained order to facilitate citizens who wished to pay their respects, while remaining vigilant against a small minority of ill-intentioned individuals seeking to exploit the disaster to sow discord, divide society, or even disrupt emergency recovery efforts. He described these police tasks as profoundly meaningful yet immensely challenging.

He pointed out that, by staying united and steadfast in carrying out their duties, Force members completed a large-scale search operation, which was originally expected to take several weeks, in approximately one week. This once again demonstrated the HKPF's spirit of ""rising to the challenges and emerging even stronger"".

Mr Yip concluded that policing has always been a demanding profession, marked by unforeseeable challenges, weighty responsibilities and a long journey ahead. He urged the graduates to stay committed to their original aspiration and to uphold the spirit of ""rising to the challenges and emerging even stronger"" when facing future challenges. He emphasised that it should serve as the driving force inspiring them to shoulder their mission with dedication, to strive forward with renewed vigour, and to pursue excellence."

葉雲龍致辭時表示，學員正式投入前線工作後要謹記，他們不單是執法者，更是市民安心生活背後的守護者，希望他們可以發揮「行多一步」和「多思多想」的專業精神。

他提到上月發生的大埔宏福苑火災，從救災到善後，政府各部門同心協力，全方位支援災民。警隊亦投入大量人手協助救援、跟進善後和展開調查。

他指，警務人員盡快為焦急等待的家屬確定失聯人士的情況，不讓家屬留下遺憾；透過專業調查，以期將需要承擔責任的人繩之於法，守護應有的公義；承受心理衝擊和壓力進入災場搜索遺體；維持秩序，一方面便利市民進行悼念，另一方面保持警覺，防止極少數別有用心的人以災亂港，分化社會，甚至破壞緊急善後工作。他形容這些警務工作極具意義但亦充滿挑戰。

他表示，警隊上下一心，緊守崗位，以約一星期完成原預計需要多個星期才可完成的大型搜索行動，再次證明警隊「迎難而上，遇強越強」的精神。

葉雲龍指，從來警務工作都殊不簡單，無時無刻也有機會面對不可預計的挑戰，任重而道遠。他勉勵結業學員，日後面對各種挑戰時也要銘記初心和「迎難而上，遇強越強」的精神，作為推動他們肩負使命同責任，繼續奮發向前，精益求精的動力。"

南港島線（西段）項目將採用智慧綠色集體運輸系統，包括長約7.5公里的專屬高架橋及隧道、八個車站（分別為黃竹坑、香港仔、田灣、華貴、華富、數碼港、瑪麗醫院及香港大學）及一個鄰近數碼港站的車廠。項目將為香港西區及南區約13萬居民以及區內主要設施例如瑪麗醫院、數碼港等，提供穩健、環保、便捷的接駁交通服務，便利市民前往港鐵南港島線（東段）黃竹坑站和港島線香港大學站。南港島線（西段）將與南港島線（東段）及港島線形成一個環狀網絡，提升鐵路網絡的抗禦能力。

南港島線（西段）項目將為區內居民提供替代道路交通的新集體運輸出行方式，減少出行時間。現時從華富邨經黃竹坑到金鐘的車程為約35分鐘，從華富邨到香港大學的車程則為約25分鐘。當南港島線（西段）通車後，這兩段車程將分別縮短至約20分鐘和10分鐘。

運輸及物流局發言人表示：「項目沿線地勢起伏，其中華富邨與香港仔海旁的高度相差超過60米，如採用重型鐵路，走線須深入地底，運輸及成本效益皆不理想，方案在財務上不可行。我們以創新思維，迎難而上，選擇採用在專屬高架橋及隧道行走的智慧綠色集體運輸系統，提高整體成本效益。與原來的地底重鐵方案相比，建造成本預算可減少約四成，落成時間則可提前約兩年。」

政府已邀請港鐵公司開展南港島線（西段）的詳細規劃及設計，並將與港鐵公司協商項目的財務安排。南港島線（西段）的前期工程預計於二○二七年展開及於二○三四年或之前竣工，以配合區內發展包括華富邨重建計劃新增人口遷入的時間表。"
Government invites MTRCL to proceed with detailed planning and design of South Island Line (West) project,2025-12-20 10:15,2025-12-20 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/20/P2025122000214.htm,"âThe Chief Executive in Council has given approval for the Government to invite the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to proceed with the detailed planning and design of the South Island Line (West) (SIL(W)) project.

The SIL(W) project will adopt a smart and green mass transit system and consist of an approximately 7.5-km long dedicated and elevated corridor and tunnel, eight stations (namely Wong Chuk Hang, Aberdeen, Tin Wan, Wah Kwai, Wah Fu, Cyberport, Queen Mary Hospital and HKU) and a depot near the Cyberport Station. It will provide stable, environmentally friendly and convenient feeder service for around 130 000 residents and major facilities such as the Queen Mary Hospital and Cyberport in the western and southern parts of Hong Kong Island, facilitating them to go to Wong Chuk Hang Station of the South Island Line (East) and HKU Station of the Island Line. It will form a transit loop with the South Island Line (East) and Island Line, and will improve the resilience of the railway network.

The SIL(W) will provide residents in the area with an alternative traveling option of new mass transit-based transportation in lieu of road-based transportation, enjoying a shorter journey time. The existing journey time from Wah Fu Estate to Admiralty via Wong Chuk Hang is about 35 minutes and that from Wah Fu Estate to HKU is about 25 minutes. After the commissioning of the SIL(W), the journey time to the two destinations will be reduced to about 20 minutes and 10 minutes respectively.

A spokesperson of the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The alignment of the project passes through hilly terrains. The difference in altitude between Wah Fu Estate and Aberdeen promenade is over 60 metres. If heavy rail system were adopted, some sections would have to be built deep underground. The transport benefit and cost effectiveness are both unsatisfactory, making the underground heavy rail scheme financially not viable. Exercising an innovative approach to rise to the challenges, we decided to adopt a smart and green mass transit system which runs on dedicated elevated viaducts and tunnels to improve the overall cost effectiveness. Compared with the original underground heavy rail scheme, the estimated construction cost is reduced by about 40 per cent and the delivery programme is advanced by about two years.""

The Government has invited the MTRCL to proceed with the detailed planning and design of the SIL(W) project, and will further negotiate with the MTRCL on the financial arrangement of the project. It is targeted to commence the advance construction works in 2027 for completion by 2034 to support developments in the area including the timetable of new population intake of the Wah Fu Estate redevelopment."
