Government urges public to stay alert to flooding (with photos),2025-09-22 22:22,2025-09-22 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200964.htm,"In view of Super Typhoon Ragasa edging closer to the coast of Guangdong, the Drainage Services Department (DSD), the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) and the Home Affairs Department (HAD) held a joint press conference today (September 22) to release the latest flood risk assessment and brief the public on the corresponding response measures.

Due to the significant storm surge effect, coastal water levels in Hong Kong during the passage of Ragasa may be comparable to those recorded during Typhoon Hato in 2017 and Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018. According to the latest forecast by the Hong Kong Observatory, the coastal storm surge is expected to be about 2 metres on the morning of September 24, with the maximum coastal water level generally reaching around 3.5 to 4 metres above Chart Datum, and reaching as high as 4 to 5 metres above Chart Datum in Tolo Harbour.

To address potential flooding, the DSD and the CEDD have conducted flood risk assessments for coastal low-lying or windward residential areas with higher risks. Areas with a higher possibility of serious flooding include Tai O, Lei Yue Mun, Sam Mun Tsai New Village, in the vicinity of Ting Kok Road in Tai Po Old Market, in the vicinity of Kwong Fuk Road in Tai Po Market, Kar Wo Lei in Tuen Mun, low-lying areas in central Yuen Long (including Tai Tseng Wai, Wang Chau, Shan Pui Village, Yuen Long Town Centre), low-lying areas in northwest Yuen Long (including Lau Fau Shan, Sheung Pak Nai and Ha Pak Nai, Hang Hau Tsuen, Sha Kiu Tsuen), To Tau Wan Village in Ma On Shan, Nam Wai and Heung Chung in Sai Kung, Tung Chung Bay, and Kat O Fisherman Village, among others. In addition to rising water levels, members of the public should pay particular attention to the risks posed by overtopping waves in coastal areas such as Heng Fa Chuen and Tseung Kwan O South.

The DSD and the CEDD have provided sandbags to the public in the aforementioned areas, with more than double the usual number distributed. For coastal low-lying or windward residential areas with higher risks, the DSD and the CEDD have been working closely with relevant departments to implement appropriate response measures and emergency arrangements according to pre-established action plans. These include deploying temporary water-filled barriers at Po Yick Lane and Pak Shing Street near Kwong Fuk Bridge along the Lam Tsuen River in Tai Po, setting up sandbag walls along the Tseung Kwan O waterfront, and, where feasible, increasing the height of flood protection installations to more effectively prevent seawater from entering buildings or facilities, in order to mitigate potential flooding threats from storm surge and overtopping waves.The DSD has also implemented a number of special operational measures, including increasing the number of emergency response teams to a total of 200 to handle flooding and clear drainage channels in different districts across the territory, and deploying powerful pumping robots on standby in advance at multiple locations with higher risk of flooding.

District Offices have initiated relevant response measures. In view of the possible threats that Ragasa may pose to Hong Kong, District Offices will advance the opening of temporary shelters at 8am tomorrow for people in need. District Offices will closely monitor the situation, and if necessary, individual temporary shelters will commence operation earlier today. The Home Affairs Department has also activated a round-the-clock hotline (2572 8427) at noon today for public enquiries on the relevant information and will continue to release information on the operation of temporary shelters through different channels.

In addition, District Offices have co-ordinated with relevant departments and organisations to enhance preparedness, setting up sandbags and water-stop boards, among others. District Council members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams are mobilised to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to make necessary preparations. Residents in flood-prone areas are advised to stay away from their homes or stay at temporary shelters.

The DSD has been maintaining close liaison with Shenzhen Authority. At present, the water level of Shenzhen Reservoir is below the flood control limit and its operation is stable, with no discharge plan for the time being. Should discharge regulation be implemented during the typhoon, Shenzhen Authority will provide timely notification.

Members of the public should stay vigilant to the risks brought by storm surge and overtopping waves, take defensive measures as early as possible, and avoid the affected locations as far as practicable. The DSD urges the public to call the 24-hour drainage hotline at 2300 1110 to report blocked public drains or flooding for prompt assistance. The DSD will also disseminate flood-related information to the public via social media."

僱主僱員應預先訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-09-22 21:42,2025-09-22 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200874.htm,"由於三號熱帶氣旋警告信號現已生效，勞工處今日（九月二十二日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主在擬訂及執行在熱帶氣旋及暴雨警告下及其後的工作安排和應變措施時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。

當天文台在工作時間內、預計八號熱帶氣旋警告信號生效前的兩小時內發出預警，僱主應按協定的工作安排讓僱員分批離開工作地點、下班或遙距工作。為確保僱員安全和趕及在公共交通服務停止前回家，一些行動不便的僱員（例如懷孕或殘疾僱員）、須依靠容易受惡劣天氣影響的交通服務（例如渡輪服務）返回居所的僱員，以及於偏遠地點工作或居住的僱員（例如離島），應獲准優先離開。僱主亦應安排其他僱員按返家路程的距離或所需時間分批離開工作地點或下班。

如果黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外及空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣或極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號、黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。

另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
Employers and employees should make prior work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-09-22 21:42,2025-09-22 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200873.htm,"  As the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 (T3) is now in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (September 22) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of establishments, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements and contingency measures for periods during and after tropical cyclone warnings and rainstorm warnings, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees, as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or when the extreme conditions come to an end, and when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when a tropical cyclone warning, rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.
 
  When a Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement is issued during working hours, within two hours before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is expected to take effect, employers should release employees from workplaces or from work in stages or arrange for them to work remotely according to the agreed work arrangements. To ensure the safety of employees and to enable them to arrive home before suspension of public transport services, employees who have mobility problems (for example, pregnant employees or those with a disability), employees who rely on transport services which are prone to being affected by adverse weather conditions (for example, ferry services) to get home, and those who work in or are living in remote areas (for example, outlying islands) should be given priority to leave. Other employees should be released from workplaces or from work in stages according to their travelling distance or the time required for returning home.
  
  If an Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.
   
  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance on the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) or higher, Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.
  
  The spokesman also reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.

  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when there is a T8 signal or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

Precautionary measures in times of typhoons and adverse weather to safeguard occupational safety of employees,2025-09-22 20:31,2025-09-22 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200799.htm,"âAs Super Typhoon Ragasa is edging closer, Hong Kong is expected to be affected by its strong winds and heavy rain in the coming days. To safeguard the safety of employees and ensure equipment at workplaces is secure, the Labour Department (LD) today (September 22) reminds employers (including contractors and responsible persons for workplaces) to take appropriate precautionary measures immediately.

A spokesperson for the LD said, ""According to the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance and the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, employers have an obligation to ensure the safety and health of employees at work, including providing and maintaining safe workplaces, safe systems of work and safe plant. If employees are required to work under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure that the hazards associated with relevant working environments are properly controlled and the risks are reduced to the minimum.""

Those who contravene the relevant provisions under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance and the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

The spokesperson continued,""Before the advent of typhoons or adverse weather, employers should pay attention to weather forecasts issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, suspend all non-essential outdoor work, and arrange for employees to take shelter in safe locations or leave work early. If it is necessary to arrange for employees to be on duty, employers must conduct advance assessments of the work risks caused by typhoons or adverse weather, promptly make work arrangements and take corresponding precautionary measures.""

The spokesman also reminded employers that they must promptly take appropriate precautionary measures and secure all outdoor equipment (e.g. scaffolds, working platforms, lifting appliances, suspended working platforms, temporary power supply equipment, etc) to prevent accidents.

After the typhoons or adverse weather have passed, employers, and employees should remain vigilant, inspect the workplaces and take adequate safety measures before fully resuming work. Employees should also co-operate by following safety instructions and by using safety equipment."
Hong Kong hosts tripartite meeting on prevention and control of communicable diseases to further enhance collaborative efficiency and capabilities in joint prevention and control across GBA (with photos),2025-09-22 20:17,2025-09-22 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200847.htm,"The 22nd Tripartite Meeting on Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases convened in Hong Kong today (September 22). Senior representatives from the health authorities of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao gathered to review the tripartite area's collaborative capabilities and preparedness against communicable diseases. The goal is to further strengthen the existing co-operation mechanisms in order to better safeguard the health and well-being of residents in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

The tripartite meeting was hosted by Department of Health (DH) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). It was co-chaired by the Deputy Director-General of the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission and Director of the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, Dr Song Tie; the Director of Health of Hong Kong, Dr Ronald Lam; and the Acting Deputy Director of the Health Bureau of Macao, Dr Tai Wa Hou.

In addition to reviewing the progress of co-operation since the last meeting in areas such as emergency response, communicable disease surveillance and prevention, and information exchange, participants also exchanged views on current public health issues of mutual concern, including:


Overview of key communicable diseases in the tripartite area;
Prevention and control of seasonal influenza and other vaccine-preventable diseases;
Current situation, and prevention and control of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF); and
Infection control in healthcare institutions, and prevention and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.


In his address, Mr Song noted that since the beginning of the year, the three places have achieved seamless coordination in epidemic surveillance, risk assessment, information sharing and emergency response. In preparation for the 15th National Games (15th NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG), the three places conducted a public health exercise, code-named ""Jingfeng"". The exercise advanced the construction of a multi-tiered public health safety net in the GBA characterised by ""integrated defense and multi-disease prevention"". Facing threats from mosquito-borne diseases such as CF, the three places swiftly shared the latest epidemic developments, conducted multiple technical exchanges on prevention and control, and strengthened joint efforts in epidemic prevention. The newly revised Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and the Law of the People's Republic of China on Responding to Public Health Emergencies, which came into effect this year, provided further insights and inspiration for the joint prevention and control of communicable diseases in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.

Address the meeting, Dr Lam said, ""Due to factors such as climate change and increased travel, recent months have seen a peak in mosquito-borne diseases. Guangdong Province and the Macao SAR have demonstrated outstanding response capabilities in addressing the CF outbreak. Their successful experiences provide valuable references and insights for Hong Kong. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme and measures to prevent and control various infectious diseases through vaccination have set an exemplary standard. Additionally, monitoring antimicrobial resistance remains a significant long-term challenge in the management of healthcare institutions. We must rigorously implement infection prevention and control measures to curb the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, align with the national 'Healthcare Institution Infection Control Action' and strengthen collaborative surveillance of resistant bacterial strains through the laboratory networks in the tripartite area.""

In his video address, the Director of the Health Bureau of Macao, Dr Lo Iek-long, stated that co-operation among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in communicable disease prevention and control has continuously deepened. Since July this year, the effective implementation of the joint prevention and control mechanism has significantly contained CF and DF. Facing global communicable disease challenges, this meeting was significant in strengthening regional co-operation, enhancing the effectiveness of prevention and control measures, and safeguarding public health. The three places will continue to leverage the development opportunities presented by the national strategy of building the GBA to continuously work toward a ""Healthy Bay Area"" and a ""Healthy China"".

The meeting was attended by approximately seventy people from the health departments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao (including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Huizhou, Zhaoqing, Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR), as well as the Hong Kong Hospital Authority and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. The meeting successfully reached a consensus on the eight areas listed in the annex.

Dr Lam added that the three places have long shared the philosophy of ""joint prevention and control"" and ""information sharing"". This meeting further advanced regional health integration. Exploring the introduction of technologies, such as artificial intelligence and big data analysis, will optimise the current notification mechanism and build a more robust health defense for residents in the GBA.

Macao will host the next Tripartite Meeting on Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases.

民政及青年事務局局長巡視落實防風措施情況後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-09-22 20:16,2025-09-22 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200844.htm,"政務司司長陳國基今日（九月二十二日）下午聯同保安局局長鄧炳強、發展局局長甯漢豪和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟巡視落實防風措施的情況後會見傳媒。以下是麥美娟的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長︰大家好，民政事務總署和民政及青年事務局（民青局）團隊在過去幾日已在各區做好一些防風和防水浸的準備，亦與地區的區議員、關愛隊和地區「三會」成員一起在區內容易出現水浸或受颱風影響的地點做了準備，尤其昨日我們在司長的委員會（極端天氣督導委員會）領導下，我們更將各項工作加強，包括正如司長所說，各區臨時庇護中心會提早在明早八時開放，方便居民，尤其住在偏遠鄉郊的市民，譬如他們明早吃過早餐，收拾東西後，趁天氣好可以到臨時庇護中心休息。另外，我們亦會加強各區的準備，大家可能記得在早幾日東區的疏散行動中，很多物資運往東區，所以這幾日我們都在確保所有物資由東區搬回到18區，確保所有庇護中心的物資足夠在颱風期間給予到庇護中心逗留的市民使用。

第二是信息的發放，正如剛才司長所說，我們通過地區網絡，包括區議員、地區「三會」成員，最重要是關愛隊義工，在地區內向一些容易受水浸影響的市民發放颱風信息。正如剛才司長所說，單是在鯉魚門村這裏，我們已經探訪了許多住戶，就是俗語說的「洗村」，意思是我們逐家逐戶去探訪住戶，告訴他們颱風的影響和嚴重性，呼籲他們到大家身後所見的庇護中心，盡快做好安排。

第三，我們也通過地區網絡，動員各區關愛隊的隊員和義工，為一些容易受水浸影響的地點，包括現在所見的鯉魚門村，我剛才也到過的馬鞍山渡頭灣村，甚至北區的一些偏遠鄉郊，協助村民。譬如大澳，大澳也可能是一個受到嚴重影響的地方。我們和一些義工幫助村民，將他們的傢俬升高，同時協助一些長者疏散到庇護中心，我們現正在做這方面的工作。

我亦呼籲市民，希望大家可以配合我們這方面的工作，因為今次颱風的影響將會是很嚴重的，我們希望能夠做好預備工作，因為如果不幸，到颱風吹襲時，到八號、十號風球水浸時才想疏散至庇護中心，實在是來不及做，因為要協助每一個長者、老人家，我們要幫他推輪椅也好，或者幫忙扶他前往也好，都需要時間。我們明白現在要大家及早預備會覺得很不便，但民青局或民政處團隊都希望可以確保各位市民的安全。所以希望大家響應我們的呼籲，及早去庇護中心休息一下，確保自己的人身安全。

最後，我希望所有市民都可以發揮我們優良的鄰里守望精神，除了政府部門的同事、民青局、民政署團隊和整個地區治理團隊，我們一定會盡力去協助市民之外，都希望市民能夠發揮鄰里守望的相助精神，大家關心一下鄰居伯伯和婆婆有甚麼需要，或者看看哪一個家庭有沒有一些特別需要，大家互相幫助，有甚麼需要可以通知政府部門、區議員、地區「三會」成員和地區關愛隊的義工，希望我們一起去確保在這個嚴重的颱風下市民能夠安全。多謝。"

我想跟大家說說我們在處理水浸、斜坡管理、塌樹及構築物安全方面的工作。

正如司長剛才說，我們中央的緊急應變中心已經在添馬總部成立，其他有關部門亦已啓動了其緊急應變中心的工作。在這方面，發展局現時已聯繫了建造業界接近70個承建商，請他們預先安排加強人手，現時我們知道已經有1 300多人的備用人手，這是建造業界的承建商。另外還有很多不同類型的器械，包括挖泥機、夾斗機，這些在我們稍後抗災時都非常有用，隨時可以調配。

我們在不同工作範圍如何盡量把水浸風險減到最低呢？今日較早前渠務署和土木工程拓展署已舉行記者會向大家交代，我在此便不再重覆。但我亦呼籲市民，除了現時我們見到風險特別高的11個地點，大家亦應盡能力做好防患措施，特別如果有電機房位處比較低矮樓層，其實真的適宜擺設一些沙包。在這方面，我們和承建商現已備存四萬多個沙包，並已與民政事務總署聯繫，大家有需要透過各區民政處可以領取。

在斜坡管理方面，始終我們的夏季是風季。其實在過去一星期，土木工程拓展署的土力處已巡視了香港風險比較高的一些人造斜坡。所謂風險高，可能是位於一些人流、車流多的道路附近，我們已經巡視了一轉，希望起碼現時它們是穩固的。

另外，如果是地盤，無論是工務工程的部門和私人地盤，我們已經發信通知了所有承建商，要求他們做足他們應該做的措施；而如果有些地盤現時有上蓋工程進行中，特別是在路旁的，其實我們的部門正主動陸續做巡查。

樹木方面，我們已經要求了所有樹木管理部門，如果手頭上有一些樹木本身需要修剪或者開始變弱，盡快在過去幾日將它處理；如果暫時處理不到的就要圍封，所以其實所有有關部門過去幾天都已經啓動了有關工作。

在此我也呼籲各位市民配合政府的工作，而我們在抗災過後社會需要做一些檢查，讓社會盡快復原，希望到時大家都配合政府的工作，不要說一見到「落波」就到處走，因為無論我們的樹或者斜坡，經過一個大風之後都是會變弱的。多謝大家。"

為了應對這個超強颱風可能帶來的影響，紀律部隊、特別是應急的部隊及輔助部隊已作好一切準備。除了剛才司長所說，我們已啓動緊急事故監察及支援中心之外，應急部隊、特別是消防的同事已巡查一些較高危的地方，設置安全繩，有需要時可協助市民作出疏散工作。

警隊已準備額外超過2 000名同事隨時幫忙；而消防處亦有1 000名同事及80輛消防車在有需要時出動協助。另外，民安隊的水災拯救隊及攀山拯救隊亦預備好隨時出動協助。醫療輔助隊及民安隊共有超過1 000名人員會幫忙。此外，政府飛行服務隊的定翼機亦會在有需要時飛入風暴地區獲取相關氣象數據。正如大家都記得，上次亦有定翼機拍攝風眼的情況。另外，整體由紀律部隊組成的特務警察亦有500人隨時候命，有需要時作出支援。

在此，除了剛才司長的呼籲外，我亦想再提醒一次，各位市民千萬不要追風逐浪，這不僅會令你自己有危險、令家人擔心，亦會令前往救援的人員身處險境。多謝大家。"

各位傳媒朋友，大家好。

超強颱風樺加沙逐漸靠近廣東沿岸，我在昨天上午已經召開應對天氣督導委員會會議，確保政府各部門作出全面和充分的準備及應變部署，以應對樺加沙可能為香港帶來的嚴重威脅。

天文台已經預告在今晚九時四十分改發三號風球。雖然明日上午，根據天文台預告，可能有短暫陽光，但其後天氣會急速轉壞，而且天氣有時早、有時會遲，天文台亦已宣布考慮在明日下午一時至四時改發八號風球，而星期三的天氣會持續惡劣，有頻密狂風大驟雨及雷暴。按目前預測，樺加沙將在星期三上午最接近香港。我在這裏呼籲各位市民，立即為未來兩日持續惡劣天氣做好應急、防風、防水浸準備。

市民的安全永遠是我們的首要考慮，當中學生安全更加是重中之重。為確保學生安全，避免學生於天氣急速轉壞的情況下一起放學、一起離開學校，情況不理想，可能會造成混亂，甚至交通上亦會有很大壓力，所以教育局已經提早宣布所有學校明日及後日停課。我得悉由於我們提早宣布停課，有部分學校已經即時安排和通知學生，明早會改為網上授課，我覺得這個安排非常好，可以令學校不會因為打風兩日而影響學習。

政府已經全部準備好，全方位部署。按照行政長官的指示，保安局轄下的緊急事故監察及支援中心已經提前於今日早上十時三十分全面啓動，以往中心一般在八號風球或黑雨啓動，這次已提早在今早十時三十分啓動，預先做好統籌及應變部署。中心有相關部門的首長級人員實時監察全港市面的情況，以迅速協調應對，這很重要，我們今早已經開始全天候監察整個香港的情況。

各區民政事務處亦會提早在明日上午八時開放臨時庇護中心，讓有需要市民入住。我呼籲各位居於水浸風險較高地區的居民，以及居於一些臨時搭建物，例如天台屋或斜坡附近寮屋的市民，如覺得居所有危險，請盡早遷離居所，或到臨時庇護中心暫避。

各個政府部門已經全力加強預防及防禦措施，應對水浸、山泥傾瀉、塌樹及構築物安全等準備工作。我剛剛聯同幾位局長巡視了三個地點，包括一條位於沙田的行人隧道。這條隧道靠近城門河，在地勢較低的地方，距離現時城門河的水位還有大約兩米多，一旦情況變壞，水位會高於欄杆，我估計一、兩分鐘內，就已經可以將這條行人隧道淹沒，我認為情況是危險的。我很感謝路政署的同事早已在16條類似的行人隧道裝置探測器測量水位，另外亦有鏡頭24小時監測是否有人在內。鑑於這次有可能出現水浸情況，所以我們決定明日八號風球生效數小時後，待市民回家後、沒甚麼人使用這些行人隧道時，就會提早封鎖，不會開放給市民使用，除了有監測系統外，亦有警務人員在場，確保市民安全，因為這是最重要的，如果屆時水位超過堤壩時，我相信一、兩分鐘內就會淹沒這條行人隧道，所以一定要提早進行。

第二是一個土瓜灣的地盤，我和同事視察過，跟相關負責人談過，他們由今日開始已做好防風措施，包括綁好棚架，為天秤做好應有的防風措施，亦已進行測試，確保沒有問題。另外，我問到明日工人的上班情況，他很清楚地答，如果明日八號風球，工人一定不用上班，我覺得地盤安全是非常重要，他亦跟我們說，其他地盤都會同樣安排。屋宇署同事亦會到不同地盤巡查，確保所有地盤都符合上述要求。

我亦視察了鯉魚門這裏。這裏地處低窪，亦靠近海。大家剛才看到，第一，我們已經因應明日這裏有機會出現水浸情況做好準備，當然我們不希望這個情況出現，但如果這情況出現，我們要做好準備。「龍吸水」已經在此準備，吸水能力很強，亦很靈活，根據同事所說，「龍吸水」可以每小時吸走大約三分一個泳池的水，所以吸水能力很強。另外，消防同事搭建了一些繩，大家不要少看這些繩，如遇水浸時，這些繩能幫助居民和救護人員穩定自己的身體，另外亦搭建了一些臨時的行人通道，這些通道是離開地面的，如有水浸，真的要撤離市民時，他們也不用涉水而行，而是可以使用這些通道。我們很感謝各政府部門，包括路政署、屋宇署、紀律部隊例如消防，全部做好方方面面的準備。

而各區民政事務處已協調相關部門和機構會再加強防備，例如準備更多沙包，讓有需要的市民可以使用，關愛隊和「三會」委員已經兩度向所有鯉魚門村居民講述水浸的可能性，呼籲他們一定要先保護自己的財物，將它們放高，如有需要，請盡快入住庇護中心。

我想跟大家強調，按照天文台的預測，超強颱風樺加沙會為香港帶來嚴重威脅，對香港構成的威脅可以大至二○一七年年天鴿和二○一八年山竹的嚴重程度。我再一次呼籲各位市民、機構、商戶應該盡快為未來兩天持續惡劣天氣做好各項應急、防風、防水浸準備。

我想再呼籲一下，因為這個風暴期間，情況比較嚴重，我再次呼籲所有市民不要出外追風逐浪，不要觀浪看風，應留在安全地方。如有市民追風逐浪，不聽從警務人員的指示去做的話，警務人員會嚴厲執法。因為他們這樣做，不但危害自己的安全，亦危害執法人員和救援人員的安全，是絕對不值得這樣做。明日開始連續兩日天氣惡劣，我亦呼籲僱主，一定要以員工安全為首要考慮，一定要以體諒的態度去決定員工在甚麼情況下需要上班，亦要理解大風大雨為他們帶來上班的困難，要採取情理兼備和彈性的處理方法。我亦可以這樣說，其實僱主是有責任為員工提供一個安全的工作環境，當然包括上班和下班的路程。如有僱主不合理地將其員工的安危置諸不理，令員工受傷的話，第一，他自己會過意不去，因為員工是為其工作和賺錢的；第二，他亦可能觸犯法例。我強烈希望僱主一定要首要考慮員工上班的安全。

我希望所有市民盡快將一些容易吹倒的物件綑綁或搬到室內。我再呼籲一次，如居所位處於容易發生水浸的地方，剛才渠務署署長亦說過，有些地方容易水浸，請盡早將重要財物放在安全地方，停車場方面，亦建議停泊在戶外的車輛，如有可能的話，盡量將車輛安排到室內停車場。

以上是我想說的。現在請保安局局長。

記者：司長，剛才所說都是危險地方，例如呼籲位處低窪的人士離開，並到庇護中心暫避，會否考慮提早識別他們，強制他們入住庇護中心？關於破壞力嚴重方面，會否考慮星期四停工停課，讓應急部門恢復市面的情況？另外，有關全政府動員的機制，可否說明初步的考慮如何？細節為何？謝謝。

政務司司長：首先我們呼籲居於危險地方的居民（到庇護中心暫避），其實香港絕大部分住宅是安全的，是絕大部分。如剛才所說，政府最重要是（保護）市民安全，市民最能幫助政府的，就是令自己安全，留在家中是最安全的做法。絕大部分住宅均符合安全標準，我們希望絕大部分市民留在家中，不要外出。至於居住在有水浸威脅或結構有問題的房屋的市民，我們希望他們入住庇護中心。我們不想強制性去做，因為每一個人都有其選擇，但當然身處危險時，救援人員、紀律部隊人員都會上門，請他們撤離至庇護中心，不想每次都用執法的方式，而用勸喻方式。希望在這些地方居住的居民，如果知道自己有危險時，請配合救援人員和紀律部隊的幫忙，這是最好的，我不想每次都使用執法方式，像拘捕般，不是這樣做法。

第二，現時天文台的預測是星期二和星期三的情況比較惡劣，星期四的情況，現階段還太早，但當然我們會留意，如果星期四的情況有問題，會適時作出公布。暫時是星期二和星期三不用上課。

政府總動員方面，已經通知公務員有可能要出來幫忙，至於在甚麼情況發生，就是當風暴過後，如果不幸地社會有很多地方需要清理和開通，有倒塌的樹，需要同事和大量人手，我們會動員公務員同事，已經預先告訴他們，會作好準備。

記者：首先想問司長有否預計過受災的情況？剛才提到救援的情況，有2 000名同事、1 000個消防等幫忙，是否足夠？市民在家中是否真的如你所說安全﹖有甚麼能提醒他們要自保？如果遇到停電有何需要準備？另外，鯉魚門是水浸黑點，有沒有想過在甚麼情況之下考慮要他們直接撤離，或者民政會否有相關措施幫助市民直接撤離？有沒有考慮準則？是否真的有信心「龍吸水」可以應付一米水深的情況及風暴潮？

政務司司長陳國基：現在很難評估受災情況，因為天氣瞬息萬變，但是天文台預測指情況類似山竹、天鴿。如果屬實，當然程度比較嚴重，但反過來說，經過山竹和天鴿的損害後，政府在多方面作出改善工作，例如「龍吸水」，這是我們買入的儀器，在上次應用時發覺非常有用。剛才我說，「龍吸水」吸水程度能在一小時吸三分之一個泳池的水量，我們共有十部，有很靈活的調配，如果有地方真的一部不夠，可以多運一部過來，這樣一個小時就可吸到三分之二個泳池的水，對於水浸的情況是一定有幫助，這是肯定的。

如剛才所說，所有紀律部隊和應急隊伍已經全部就位，所有紀律部隊也作好準備，有需要時就派人員去協助，對於他們的專業工作，我是很有信心的。如我剛才所說，很多人的家居是安全的，大家當然要注意關好窗。在當風的地方，要做防風的措施；如果窗被打破時，要把重要物品放離當風位置，諸如此類。絕大部分市民在打風期間留家，總比外出安全。但是如果你覺得在家裏不夠安全，請你主動聯絡我們，前往庇護中心。庇護中心除了提供休息地方外，（在八號風球發出前）亦有關愛隊人員提供服務，包括（市民）要吃飯、麵等，我們都會安排。

剛才已說過，「龍吸水」是一個很有效的工具，所以增加（數量），原本有六部，現多買四部，共有十部，我相信靈活運用的話，是可以對水浸的情況有大幅度的幫助。有關這區的市民，我們希望情況並不如想像中這麼差，當然我們會按最差的情況去準備，可以看到已經準備好——繩索已經綁好、行人路已架高、（擋）水板和沙包已經準備好。同事已經在很多低窪地區做好準備工作，幾日前已經全部外出進行準備，儘管大家未必看到他們的工作情況。渠務署同事已完成通渠工作，盡量希望不會有淤塞的情況；路政署同事亦到處檢查隧道；屋宇署亦有同事檢查招牌、棚架，甚至地盤有沒有紮得不穩的東西。剛才我巡視時，發覺大家都做得很好，所以我希望我們做的事是「做多了」，但是安全永遠都在第一位。

記者：你好，首先想問一下，剛剛都多次提到，就好像山竹一樣，（樺加沙的）影響力是大的。今次政府宣布停課兩日，亦呼籲僱主體諒和有彈性，但是會不會真的考慮到動用極端情況呢？具體有甚麼準則才會考慮去用呢？第二就是如果僱主真的叫員工去上班，雖然剛剛都分享過可能會犯法，但是其實他（僱主）叫他們（僱員）去上班其實都已經面對一個風險，其實都未必等得及去投訴，往往市民可能怕失去工作而攀山涉水地上班。如果員工自己真的遇到這些情況，他們應該怎樣做呢？

政務司司長：剛才我所說，（樺加沙的）風的強度、大雨的程度，是類似山竹和天鴿，這是天文台給我們的預測、一個預報。我們停課兩日，是因為根據天文台的預測，明日稍後會發八號烈風或暴風信號，後日天氣會持續惡劣，所以我們是（停課）兩日。因為天氣很難說，如果在往後（情況）真的持續惡劣時，我們肯定會再作公布。

極端情況是甚麼情況呢？一般來說，就是當八號烈風或暴風信號轉回三號強風信號，或是黑色暴雨警告信號轉回紅色或黃色暴雨警告信號時，這時候市民理論上要上班，學生可能要上學，但我們屆時會看看，究竟社會情況是否容許上班。上次山竹是一個很好的例子，當時八號烈風或暴風信號轉回三號強風信號時，很多樹塌下來阻塞道路，水浸情況很嚴重，亦有部分山泥傾瀉。在這情況下是不可能叫員工冒險上班。可以這樣說，在這情況下，市面情況包括道路、包括所有情況，暫時不適宜市民出來上班。在這情況下我們宣布極端情況，雖然已發出三號強風信號，但同樣用處理八號烈風或暴風信號的方法，讓市民繼續留在安全的地方，直至極端情況完結，即是我們清理了道路，令道路暢通，沒有再水浸，這個情況可以上班、上學。在這次來說，當然有需要時我們會用上極端情況，但我們亦提早做了很多事，剛才所說，所謂超前部署，第一，就是事先要清理一些渠道，看看哪些地盤要紥好物料。

另外，到八號烈風或暴風信號後期的時候，其實承辦商都會出來幫忙清理市面，當然紀律部隊一定會幫忙先做，但是承辦商都會出來做。目的就是希望即使受到破壞，我們也希望破壞能夠迅速復原，令市面盡快回復正常。我們希望極端情況不用再用，但是如果有需要，我們會用，情況就是這樣。僱主方面，剛才我已經解釋，勞工處的守則都說明希望僱主和僱員事先溝通，知道極端天氣的情況，例如發出八號烈風或暴風信號或黑色暴雨警告信號時，他們（僱員）的上班安排是怎樣的，因為每一個工種都不一樣。舉一個極端一點的例子——消防員，就算黑色暴雨警告信號、八號烈風或暴風信號下都是要上班，但是絕大部分的工作都不用的。所以我們說希望僱主用一個情理兼備的方式去考慮員工的安危，因為員工的安危，也是僱主的責任。勞工法例上都有寫清楚，僱主是需要為他的員工，提供一個安全的工作環境。這個安全的工作環境包括上班和下班的情況。剛才我所說，如果他（僱主）很不合理地要求員工在很危險的情況下上班，如果這個員工又聽從他的指示，結果受傷，這樣的話，這個僱主有很大的責任，因為他有機會違反法例，有機會受到檢控。

當然每一個僱主也應善待你的員工，你的員工是為你賺錢的，你不應該讓他冒險。況且颱風只是一日、半日，你叫他上班是不是真的幫你賺到很多錢呢？我覺得是有很大的懷疑的。（颱風時）很多店鋪都沒有人，沒有人在街道上，市民都是按呼籲留在家，店鋪營業有甚麼意思呢？所以我希望僱主是情理兼備，做好一個體諒的僱主，除了員工安全之外，亦有良好的僱主、僱員的關係，這樣才是長遠之計。謝謝各位。"
​政務司司長巡視落實防風措施情況後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-22 20:08,2025-09-22 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200869.htm,"政務司司長陳國基今日（九月二十二日）下午聯同保安局局長鄧炳強、發展局局長甯漢豪和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟巡視落實防風措施的情況後會見傳媒。以下是陳國基的談話內容：

各位傳媒朋友，大家好。

超強颱風樺加沙逐漸靠近廣東沿岸，我在昨天上午已經召開應對天氣督導委員會會議，確保政府各部門作出全面和充分的準備及應變部署，以應對樺加沙可能為香港帶來的嚴重威脅。

天文台已經預告在今晚九時四十分改發三號風球。雖然明日上午，根據天文台預告，可能有短暫陽光，但其後天氣會急速轉壞，而且天氣有時早、有時會遲，天文台亦已宣布考慮在明日下午一時至四時改發八號風球，而星期三的天氣會持續惡劣，有頻密狂風大驟雨及雷暴。按目前預測，樺加沙將在星期三上午最接近香港。我在這裏呼籲各位市民，立即為未來兩日持續惡劣天氣做好應急、防風、防水浸準備。

市民的安全永遠是我們的首要考慮，當中學生安全更加是重中之重。為確保學生安全，避免學生於天氣急速轉壞的情況下一起放學、一起離開學校，情況不理想，可能會造成混亂，甚至交通上亦會有很大壓力，所以教育局已經提早宣布所有學校明日及後日停課。我得悉由於我們提早宣布停課，有部分學校已經即時安排和通知學生，明早會改為網上授課，我覺得這個安排非常好，可以令學校不會因為打風兩日而影響學習。

政府已經全部準備好，全方位部署。按照行政長官的指示，保安局轄下的緊急事故監察及支援中心已經提前於今日早上十時三十分全面啓動，以往中心一般在八號風球或黑雨啓動，這次已提早在今早十時三十分啓動，預先做好統籌及應變部署。中心有相關部門的首長級人員實時監察全港市面的情況，以迅速協調應對，這很重要，我們今早已經開始全天候監察整個香港的情況。

各區民政事務處亦會提早在明日上午八時開放臨時庇護中心，讓有需要市民入住。我呼籲各位居於水浸風險較高地區的居民，以及居於一些臨時搭建物，例如天台屋或斜坡附近寮屋的市民，如覺得居所有危險，請盡早遷離居所，或到臨時庇護中心暫避。

各個政府部門已經全力加強預防及防禦措施，應對水浸、山泥傾瀉、塌樹及構築物安全等準備工作。我剛剛聯同幾位局長巡視了三個地點，包括一條位於沙田的行人隧道。這條隧道靠近城門河，在地勢較低的地方，距離現時城門河的水位還有大約兩米多，一旦情況變壞，水位會高於欄杆，我估計一、兩分鐘內，就已經可以將這條行人隧道淹沒，我認為情況是危險的。我很感謝路政署的同事早已在16條類似的行人隧道裝置探測器測量水位，另外亦有鏡頭24小時監測是否有人在內。鑑於這次有可能出現水浸情況，所以我們決定明日八號風球生效數小時後，待市民回家後、沒甚麼人使用這些行人隧道時，就會提早封鎖，不會開放給市民使用，除了有監測系統外，亦有警務人員在場，確保市民安全，因為這是最重要的，如果屆時水位超過堤壩時，我相信一、兩分鐘內就會淹沒這條行人隧道，所以一定要提早進行。

第二是一個土瓜灣的地盤，我和同事視察過，跟相關負責人談過，他們由今日開始已做好防風措施，包括綁好棚架，為天秤做好應有的防風措施，亦已進行測試，確保沒有問題。另外，我問到明日工人的上班情況，他很清楚地答，如果明日八號風球，工人一定不用上班，我覺得地盤安全是非常重要，他亦跟我們說，其他地盤都會同樣安排。屋宇署同事亦會到不同地盤巡查，確保所有地盤都符合上述要求。

我亦視察了鯉魚門這裏。這裏地處低窪，亦靠近海。大家剛才看到，第一，我們已經因應明日這裏有機會出現水浸情況做好準備，當然我們不希望這個情況出現，但如果這情況出現，我們要做好準備。「龍吸水」已經在此準備，吸水能力很強，亦很靈活，根據同事所說，「龍吸水」可以每小時吸走大約三分一個泳池的水，所以吸水能力很強。另外，消防同事搭建了一些繩，大家不要少看這些繩，如遇水浸時，這些繩能幫助居民和救護人員穩定自己的身體，另外亦搭建了一些臨時的行人通道，這些通道是離開地面的，如有水浸，真的要撤離市民時，他們也不用涉水而行，而是可以使用這些通道。我們很感謝各政府部門，包括路政署、屋宇署、紀律部隊例如消防，全部做好方方面面的準備。

而各區民政事務處已協調相關部門和機構會再加強防備，例如準備更多沙包，讓有需要的市民可以使用，關愛隊和「三會」委員已經兩度向所有鯉魚門村居民講述水浸的可能性，呼籲他們一定要先保護自己的財物，將它們放高，如有需要，請盡快入住庇護中心。

我想跟大家強調，按照天文台的預測，超強颱風樺加沙會為香港帶來嚴重威脅，對香港構成的威脅可以大至二○一七年年天鴿和二○一八年山竹的嚴重程度。我再一次呼籲各位市民、機構、商戶應該盡快為未來兩天持續惡劣天氣做好各項應急、防風、防水浸準備。

我想再呼籲一下，因為這個風暴期間，情況比較嚴重，我再次呼籲所有市民不要出外追風逐浪，不要觀浪看風，應留在安全地方。如有市民追風逐浪，不聽從警務人員的指示去做的話，警務人員會嚴厲執法。因為他們這樣做，不但危害自己的安全，亦危害執法人員和救援人員的安全，是絕對不值得這樣做。明日開始連續兩日天氣惡劣，我亦呼籲僱主，一定要以員工安全為首要考慮，一定要以體諒的態度去決定員工在甚麼情況下需要上班，亦要理解大風大雨為他們帶來上班的困難，要採取情理兼備和彈性的處理方法。我亦可以這樣說，其實僱主是有責任為員工提供一個安全的工作環境，當然包括上班和下班的路程。如有僱主不合理地將其員工的安危置諸不理，令員工受傷的話，第一，他自己會過意不去，因為員工是為其工作和賺錢的；第二，他亦可能觸犯法例。我強烈希望僱主一定要首要考慮員工上班的安全。

我希望所有市民盡快將一些容易吹倒的物件綑綁或搬到室內。我再呼籲一次，如居所位處於容易發生水浸的地方，剛才渠務署署長亦說過，有些地方容易水浸，請盡早將重要財物放在安全地方，停車場方面，亦建議停泊在戶外的車輛，如有可能的話，盡量將車輛安排到室內停車場。

以上是我想說的。現在請保安局局長。

記者：司長，剛才所說都是危險地方，例如呼籲位處低窪的人士離開，並到庇護中心暫避，會否考慮提早識別他們，強制他們入住庇護中心？關於破壞力嚴重方面，會否考慮星期四停工停課，讓應急部門恢復市面的情況？另外，有關全政府動員的機制，可否說明初步的考慮如何？細節為何？謝謝。

政務司司長：首先我們呼籲居於危險地方的居民（到庇護中心暫避），其實香港絕大部分住宅是安全的，是絕大部分。如剛才所說，政府最重要是（保護）市民安全，市民最能幫助政府的，就是令自己安全，留在家中是最安全的做法。絕大部分住宅均符合安全標準，我們希望絕大部分市民留在家中，不要外出。至於居住在有水浸威脅或結構有問題的房屋的市民，我們希望他們入住庇護中心。我們不想強制性去做，因為每一個人都有其選擇，但當然身處危險時，救援人員、紀律部隊人員都會上門，請他們撤離至庇護中心，不想每次都用執法的方式，而用勸喻方式。希望在這些地方居住的居民，如果知道自己有危險時，請配合救援人員和紀律部隊的幫忙，這是最好的，我不想每次都使用執法方式，像拘捕般，不是這樣做法。

第二，現時天文台的預測是星期二和星期三的情況比較惡劣，星期四的情況，現階段還太早，但當然我們會留意，如果星期四的情況有問題，會適時作出公布。暫時是星期二和星期三不用上課。

政府總動員方面，已經通知公務員有可能要出來幫忙，至於在甚麼情況發生，就是當風暴過後，如果不幸地社會有很多地方需要清理和開通，有倒塌的樹，需要同事和大量人手，我們會動員公務員同事，已經預先告訴他們，會作好準備。

記者：首先想問司長有否預計過受災的情況？剛才提到救援的情況，有2 000名同事、1 000個消防等幫忙，是否足夠？市民在家中是否真的如你所說安全﹖有甚麼能提醒他們要自保？如果遇到停電有何需要準備？另外，鯉魚門是水浸黑點，有沒有想過在甚麼情況之下考慮要他們直接撤離，或者民政會否有相關措施幫助市民直接撤離？有沒有考慮準則？是否真的有信心「龍吸水」可以應付一米水深的情況及風暴潮？

政務司司長陳國基：現在很難評估受災情況，因為天氣瞬息萬變，但是天文台預測指情況類似山竹、天鴿。如果屬實，當然程度比較嚴重，但反過來說，經過山竹和天鴿的損害後，政府在多方面作出改善工作，例如「龍吸水」，這是我們買入的儀器，在上次應用時發覺非常有用。剛才我說，「龍吸水」吸水程度能在一小時吸三分之一個泳池的水量，我們共有十部，有很靈活的調配，如果有地方真的一部不夠，可以多運一部過來，這樣一個小時就可吸到三分之二個泳池的水，對於水浸的情況是一定有幫助，這是肯定的。

如剛才所說，所有紀律部隊和應急隊伍已經全部就位，所有紀律部隊也作好準備，有需要時就派人員去協助，對於他們的專業工作，我是很有信心的。如我剛才所說，很多人的家居是安全的，大家當然要注意關好窗。在當風的地方，要做防風的措施；如果窗被打破時，要把重要物品放離當風位置，諸如此類。絕大部分市民在打風期間留家，總比外出安全。但是如果你覺得在家裏不夠安全，請你主動聯絡我們，前往庇護中心。庇護中心除了提供休息地方外，（在八號風球發出前）亦有關愛隊人員提供服務，包括（市民）要吃飯、麵等，我們都會安排。

剛才已說過，「龍吸水」是一個很有效的工具，所以增加（數量），原本有六部，現多買四部，共有十部，我相信靈活運用的話，是可以對水浸的情況有大幅度的幫助。有關這區的市民，我們希望情況並不如想像中這麼差，當然我們會按最差的情況去準備，可以看到已經準備好——繩索已經綁好、行人路已架高、（擋）水板和沙包已經準備好。同事已經在很多低窪地區做好準備工作，幾日前已經全部外出進行準備，儘管大家未必看到他們的工作情況。渠務署同事已完成通渠工作，盡量希望不會有淤塞的情況；路政署同事亦到處檢查隧道；屋宇署亦有同事檢查招牌、棚架，甚至地盤有沒有紮得不穩的東西。剛才我巡視時，發覺大家都做得很好，所以我希望我們做的事是「做多了」，但是安全永遠都在第一位。

記者：你好，首先想問一下，剛剛都多次提到，就好像山竹一樣，（樺加沙的）影響力是大的。今次政府宣布停課兩日，亦呼籲僱主體諒和有彈性，但是會不會真的考慮到動用極端情況呢？具體有甚麼準則才會考慮去用呢？第二就是如果僱主真的叫員工去上班，雖然剛剛都分享過可能會犯法，但是其實他（僱主）叫他們（僱員）去上班其實都已經面對一個風險，其實都未必等得及去投訴，往往市民可能怕失去工作而攀山涉水地上班。如果員工自己真的遇到這些情況，他們應該怎樣做呢？

政務司司長：剛才我所說，（樺加沙的）風的強度、大雨的程度，是類似山竹和天鴿，這是天文台給我們的預測、一個預報。我們停課兩日，是因為根據天文台的預測，明日稍後會發八號烈風或暴風信號，後日天氣會持續惡劣，所以我們是（停課）兩日。因為天氣很難說，如果在往後（情況）真的持續惡劣時，我們肯定會再作公布。

極端情況是甚麼情況呢？一般來說，就是當八號烈風或暴風信號轉回三號強風信號，或是黑色暴雨警告信號轉回紅色或黃色暴雨警告信號時，這時候市民理論上要上班，學生可能要上學，但我們屆時會看看，究竟社會情況是否容許上班。上次山竹是一個很好的例子，當時八號烈風或暴風信號轉回三號強風信號時，很多樹塌下來阻塞道路，水浸情況很嚴重，亦有部分山泥傾瀉。在這情況下是不可能叫員工冒險上班。可以這樣說，在這情況下，市面情況包括道路、包括所有情況，暫時不適宜市民出來上班。在這情況下我們宣布極端情況，雖然已發出三號強風信號，但同樣用處理八號烈風或暴風信號的方法，讓市民繼續留在安全的地方，直至極端情況完結，即是我們清理了道路，令道路暢通，沒有再水浸，這個情況可以上班、上學。在這次來說，當然有需要時我們會用上極端情況，但我們亦提早做了很多事，剛才所說，所謂超前部署，第一，就是事先要清理一些渠道，看看哪些地盤要紥好物料。

另外，到八號烈風或暴風信號後期的時候，其實承辦商都會出來幫忙清理市面，當然紀律部隊一定會幫忙先做，但是承辦商都會出來做。目的就是希望即使受到破壞，我們也希望破壞能夠迅速復原，令市面盡快回復正常。我們希望極端情況不用再用，但是如果有需要，我們會用，情況就是這樣。僱主方面，剛才我已經解釋，勞工處的守則都說明希望僱主和僱員事先溝通，知道極端天氣的情況，例如發出八號烈風或暴風信號或黑色暴雨警告信號時，他們（僱員）的上班安排是怎樣的，因為每一個工種都不一樣。舉一個極端一點的例子——消防員，就算黑色暴雨警告信號、八號烈風或暴風信號下都是要上班，但是絕大部分的工作都不用的。所以我們說希望僱主用一個情理兼備的方式去考慮員工的安危，因為員工的安危，也是僱主的責任。勞工法例上都有寫清楚，僱主是需要為他的員工，提供一個安全的工作環境。這個安全的工作環境包括上班和下班的情況。剛才我所說，如果他（僱主）很不合理地要求員工在很危險的情況下上班，如果這個員工又聽從他的指示，結果受傷，這樣的話，這個僱主有很大的責任，因為他有機會違反法例，有機會受到檢控。

​保安局推出一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」,2025-09-22 19:57,2025-09-22 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200621.htm,"保安局今日（九月二十二日）推出一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」，便利香港居民及訪港旅客掌握各陸路管制站的最新情況，有助他們計劃跨境行程。

「口岸通」會以綠、黃、紅燈號顯示各個陸路管制站的過關情況，分別為「正常」、「繁忙」及「非常繁忙」三個等級，並提供平均輪候時間的粗略估算。相關資訊每15分鐘更新一次，讓旅客掌握最新情況。

以往旅客需要瀏覽多個不同平台獲得「口岸通」所載的資訊，例如分別於入境事務處（入境處）及運輸署流動應用程式查看管制站出入境大堂內旅客輪候時間和路面交通情況。往後旅客只需要瀏覽「口岸通」，就能一次過取得各陸路管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及港珠澳大橋過境穿梭巴士（金巴）和落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的平均輪候時間等有用資訊。

「口岸通」亦會實時顯示各陸路管制站的突發情況，包括附近的重大交通事故。如個別管制站的燈號顯示為「非常繁忙」或發生突發情況，旅客可考慮改用其他管制站，或預留充足時間通關。

此外，「口岸通」亦會整合其他實時資訊連結，包括深圳市人民政府口岸辦公室「i口岸」微信小程序和港珠澳大橋珠海口岸的實時過關資訊、香港即時路面交通情況等，讓旅客方便和快捷地瀏覽。

「口岸通」的資訊由入境處、香港警務處及運輸署提供。下一階段將引入實時影像，利用先進科技（如人工智能）評估各陸路管制站的實時過關情況，務求為旅客提供更智能化、更準確、更便捷的跨境資訊平台體驗。

近日，深港跨境旅客人次屢創新高，充分體現深港兩地人民雙向奔赴的深厚情誼。香港特別行政區（特區）政府一直提前部署，並透過靈活調配人手，於各個繁忙管制站啓用全部檢查櫃枱及通道，並在有需要時增設櫃枱及通道，加強人流和車流的疏導。面對一次又一次通關高峰，整體通關安排暢順。特區政府會繼續實施多管齊下的措施，包括「口岸通」平台，為南下和北上的旅客提供更佳的通關體驗。

「口岸通」網頁連結（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound）已上載至保安局網頁，相關教學示範影片已上載到保安局網頁及社交平台。"
"SB launches one-stop information platform on immigration clearance ""Easy Boundary""",2025-09-22 19:57,2025-09-22 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200643.htm,"The Security Bureau (SB) today (September 22) launched ""Easy Boundary"", a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance. The platform aims to help Hong Kong residents and visitors plan their cross-boundary trips by providing the latest information on various land boundary control points (BCPs).

""Easy Boundary"" uses green, yellow and red lights to signify the situation of land BCPs in three levels: ""Normal"", ""Busy"" and ""Very Busy"", respectively, with rough estimates of the average waiting time. The relevant information will be updated every 15 minutes to keep passengers informed.

Previously, passengers had to obtain the information now available on ""Easy Boundary"" from different platforms, such as by checking the waiting time at the departure/arrival halls of BCPs and road traffic conditions respectively on the Immigration Department (ImmD) and Transport Department (TD) mobile applications. From now on, passengers can obtain useful information on ""Easy Boundary"" in one go, including the respective average waiting time for passengers and private cars at land BCPs, as well as for the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) cross-boundary shuttle bus (Gold Bus) and the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus).

  ""Easy Boundary"" will also display real-time ad hoc situations at BCPs, including major traffic accidents nearby. If a ""Very Busy"" signal is displayed in respect of a particular control point or if an emergency occurs, passengers may consider using other ports or allowing sufficient time for immigration clearance.

  Moreover, ""Easy Boundary"" is also integrated with links to obtain other real-time information, including real-time information on immigration clearance from ""iPort"", a WeChat mini programme of the Office of Port of Entry and Exit of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, and that of the HZMB Zhuhai Port, as well as Hong Kong's real-time traffic conditions, allowing passengers to browse conveniently and quickly.

Information on ""Easy Boundary"" is provided by the ImmD, the Hong Kong Police Force and the TD. In the next phase, the platform will introduce real-time images, and will utilise advanced technology (such as artificial intelligence) to assess the real-time situation of immigration clearance at land BCPs, with a view to providing passengers with a smarter, more accurate, and more convenient cross-boundary information platform.

Recently, the number of cross-boundary passenger trips between Hong Kong and Shenzhen has reached record highs repeatedly, which fully reflects the mutual engagement between the people of the two places. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been making advance preparations. Through flexible manpower deployment, all clearance counters and channels at busy BCPs are put into operation. Additional kiosks and channels will also be arranged if necessary to further ease passenger and vehicular flows. Despite confronting peak travel periods repeatedly, the overall immigration clearance remains smooth. The HKSAR Government will continue to implement multipronged measures, including the launch of ""Easy Boundary"", to provide a better boundary-crossing experience for both southbound and northbound travellers.

A link to ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound) has been uploaded onto the SB's website. A relevant instructional video for ""Easy Boundary"" has been uploaded to the SB's webpage and social media platforms."

勞工處發言人說：「根據《職業安全及健康條例》及《工廠及工業經營條例》，僱主有責任確保僱員在工作時的安全及健康，包括為他們提供及維持安全的工作地點、工作系統及作業裝置。僱員如需在惡劣天氣或極端情況下工作，僱主須確保相關工作環境的危險受到適當控制，並在合理切實可行的範圍內將該等危險減至最低。」

如違反有關《職業安全及健康條例》及《工廠及工業經營條例》的規定，最高可處罰款一千萬元及監禁兩年。

發言人續說：「颱風或惡劣天氣來臨前，僱主應留意天文台發出的天氣預報，暫停所有非必要的戶外工作及安排員工到安全地方暫避或下班。如須安排僱員當值，僱主須預先評估熱帶氣旋或惡劣天氣所引致的工作風險，及早作出部署及採取相應的預防措施。」

發言人亦提醒，僱主須盡快對所有戶外設施（例如棚架、工作台、起重機械、吊船和臨時供電設施等）採取適當的預防措施並加以穩固，避免意外事故。

颱風或惡劣天氣過後，僱主及僱員應提高警覺，檢查工作地點及採取足夠的安全措施後，才全面復工。僱員亦應與僱主合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。"

政府呼籲市民留意水浸情況（附圖）,2025-09-22 19:17,2025-09-22 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200754.htm,"因應超強颱風樺加沙靠近廣東沿岸，渠務署、土木工程拓展署及民政事務總署今日（九月二十二日）舉行聯合記者會，發布最新的水浸風險評估，並講解相關應對措施。

由於受顯著風暴潮影響，樺加沙襲港期間本港沿岸水位可能與二○一七年的天鴿及二○一八年的山竹相若。根據天文台最新預測，九月二十四日上午本港沿岸增水約2米，最高水位普遍可達海圖基準面以上3.5米至4米，而吐露港水位更可能高達海圖基準面以上4至5米。

為應對可能出現的水浸，渠務署及土木工程拓展署已就較高風險的沿岸低窪或當風住宅地區作出水浸風險評估，有機會出現較嚴重水浸的地區包括大澳、鯉魚門、三門仔新村、大埔舊墟汀角路一帶、大埔墟廣福道一帶、屯門嘉和里、元朗中部低窪地區（包括大井圍、橫洲、山貝村、元朗市中心）、元朗西北部低窪地區（包括流浮山、上下白泥、坑口村、沙橋村）、馬鞍山渡頭灣村、西貢南圍及響鐘、東涌灣、吉澳漁民村等。除了水位上升外，市民亦應特別留意越堤浪帶來的風險，例如杏花邨、將軍澳南等沿岸地區。

渠務署及土木工程拓展署已為上述地區的市民提供沙包，沙包數量比一般情況的派發量多超過一倍。針對較高風險的沿岸低窪或當風住宅地區，渠務署及土木工程拓展署會與相關部門緊密合作，按預先制定的行動計劃，實施合適的應對措施及緊急應變安排，如在大埔林村河廣福橋附近的普益里和北盛街放置臨時充水式擋水壩、於將軍澳海濱加設沙包擋牆，亦在可行情況下加高擋水設備，以更有效防止海水流入建築物或設施，應對風暴潮和越堤浪可能帶來的水浸威脅。渠務署亦已採取多項特別行動措施，包括增加緊急應變隊伍數目至200隊，到全港各區處理水浸及清理渠道工作，並提早派遣強力排水機械人到多個水浸風險較高的地點戒備。

各區民政事務處已啓動相關應對工作，因應樺加沙可能為香港帶來的威脅，各區民政事務處將會提早於明日上午八時開放臨時庇護中心，供有需要市民入住。各區民政事務處會密切留意情況，如有需要，個別臨時庇護中心亦會今日提早運作。民政事務總署亦於今日中午設立一條二十四小時緊急事故熱線2572 8427供市民查詢相關消息，並會持續透過不同途徑發布臨時庇護中心的運作資訊。

此外，各區民政事務處已協調相關部門和機構加強防備，設置沙包和擋水板等，亦動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊向區內易受水浸影響的居民發放最新的天氣資訊，提醒他們做好準備，以及勸喻居住水浸風險較高地區的居民及早遷離居所，或到臨時庇護中心暫避。

渠務署與深圳方一直保持緊密聯繫，目前深圳水庫水位低於防汛限度水位，運行平穩，暫無排洪計劃。颱風影響期間若實施排洪調度，深圳方將及時通報。

​市民應留意風暴潮和越堤浪所帶來的風險，並及早做好防禦措施，盡量避免途經有關地點。如發現公共渠道淤塞或水浸，可致電渠務署24小時熱線2300 1110，以便盡快處理。渠務署亦會透過社交媒體向公眾發放水浸相關資訊。"

Three incoming passengers convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and alternative smoking products (with photos),2025-09-22 18:30,2025-09-22 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200741.htm,"Three incoming passengers were sentenced between 40 days' and eight months' imprisonment and fined between $800 and $2,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts and the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (September 22) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

Customs officers intercepted a 43-year-old incoming male passenger and a 37-year-old incoming female passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on July 26. About 106 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 20 000 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $479,000 and a duty potential of about $351,000 in total, were seized from their personal baggage. They were subsequently arrested.

The male passenger was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 in contravention of the DCO and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment in contravention of the IEO by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today. One month of the sentences will run concurrently, making for a total of eight months' imprisonment.

The female passenger was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $800 in contravention of the DCO and was sentenced to eight days' imprisonment in contravention of the IEO by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today. All sentences will run separately, making for a total of six months and eight days' imprisonment.

In addition, Customs officers intercepted a 55-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on September 20 and seized 541 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $2,000 and a duty potential of about $1,700 found on him. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to 40 days' imprisonment and fined $2,000 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today in contravention of the DCO.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account(crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002).

＊三地重點傳染病疫情概況；
＊季節性流感及其他疫苗可預防疾病的防控工作；
＊基孔肯雅熱及登革熱的現況及防控；及
＊醫療機構感染控制與抗微生物藥物耐藥的防控與監測工作。

宋鐵在會議上致辭時表示，今年以來三地在疫情監測、風險評估、資訊通報和應急處置等方面實現了無縫對接。三地開展了「競鋒」十五運會和殘特奧會粵港澳聯合公共衞生演習，助推構築粵港澳大灣區「一體防禦，多病共防」的多層次公共衞生安全網；面對基孔肯雅熱等蟲媒傳染病的威脅，三地及時互通疫情最新進展，多次開展防控技術交流，共同做好疫情防控。今年新修訂的《中華人民共和國傳染病防治法》和《中華人民共和國突發公共衞生事件應對法》相繼施行，也為粵港澳三地進一步深化傳染病聯防聯控提供了更多思路和啟發。

林文健醫生致辭時說：「由於氣候變化、旅遊數量增加等因素影響，最近數月是蚊媒傳染病高峰期，廣東省與澳門特別行政區在應對基孔肯雅熱疫情方面，展現出卓越的應對能力。兩地的成功經驗為香港提供了寶貴的參考與借鑒。另外，香港兒童疫苗接種計劃以及透過疫苗接種防控不同傳染病的措施，也樹立了卓越的典範。此外，抗菌藥物耐藥性監測是醫療機構管理中長期面臨的重要挑戰，我們要嚴格落實感染防控措施，遏止耐藥菌的傳播蔓延，對接國家『醫療機構感染控制行動』，強化三地實驗室網絡對耐藥菌株的協同監測。」

澳門衞生局局長羅奕龍醫生透過視像致辭表示，粵港澳三地在傳染病防控領域的合作不斷深化，今年七月以來聯防聯控機制的有效實施令基孔肯雅熱及登革熱明顯受控。面對全球各種傳染病挑戰，會議在加強區域合作、提升防控效能、保障公共安全等多方面意義重大，三地將繼續依托建設粵港澳大灣區的國家戰略發展機遇，為健康灣區、健康中國不斷發力。

粵港澳三地衞生部門（包括來自廣州市、深圳市、珠海市、佛山市、東莞市、中山市、惠州市、肇慶市，及香港和澳門特區）、香港醫院管理局及食物環境衞生署均有派員參與是次聯席會議，共約七十人。會議成功達成八項共識（見附件）。

林文健醫生表示，三地多年來「聯防聯控、信息共享」的合作理念高度契合，是次會議進一步推動區域衞生一體化，透過探討引入人工智慧與大資料分析等技術，將有助進一步優化現行通報機制，為大灣區居民構築更堅實的健康防線。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-22 17:30,2025-09-22 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200680.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 22), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 22 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 771 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (September 14 to 20), a significant increase compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 201 cases (September 7 to 13) and 178 cases (August 31 to September 6) respectively, in which 2 583 cases were recorded in Jiangmen. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââ
  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

"Korean theatre production ""The Cherry Orchard"" opens Third Asia+ Festival (with photos)",2025-09-22 17:16,2025-09-22 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200579.htm,"  The third Asia+ Festival commenced last Friday (September 19) with the opening programme of the box-office hit ""The Cherry Orchard"" at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre for three consecutive nights. The Festival, presented by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, is held annually from September to November with an aim to create a sustainable platform for arts and cultural exchanges.

  The Korean theatre production of ""The Cherry Orchard"" by internationally renowned director Simon Stone, starring Cannes Best Actress Jeon Do-yeonand globally recognised actor Park Hae-soofrom ""Squid Game"", brings striking originality to Russian master dramatist Anton Chekhov's classic. Stone, Jeon and Park also attended meet-the-artist sessions after the performances and shared their thoughts on their participation in the production.

  Stone said that he was very excited as ""The Cherry Orchard"" marked the first time his work had been physically performed in Hong Kong, serving as the first stop of the play's world tour. Park, Jeon and actor Son Sang-kyumentioned that before the show they were concerned that the language barrier would affect the viewing experience, but soon found out onstage that the audience was fully engaged, responding actively to the plot's developments and enjoying the entire performance. Jeon added that this performance in Hong Kong, bringing together an Australian director, Korean actors, and a Russian classic, was an amazing experience for her.

  While focusing on Asia, the Asia+ Festival also connects with Belt and Road countries and regions. This year, the Festival is bringing together outstanding artists from over 30 countries and regions, of which 12 are new participating countries including South Africa, North Macedonia and Argentina, which are presenting respectively the dance performance ""We wear our wheels with pride"", the folk concert ""Makedonissimo"", ""Tango After Dark"", and more.

許正宇說：「行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中提出繼續推動發展香港大宗商品交易生態圈，包括支持業界設立更多認可倉庫。相關政策局和部門一直與業者保持溝通，並就技術事宜提供適當協助。倫敦金屬交易所擴充在港倉儲設施，積極回應《施政報告》的政策方向。香港被納入倫敦金屬交易所全球倉庫網絡不足九個月，連同早前已批准的八個倉庫，倫敦金屬交易所在港認可倉庫的總數已增加至11個，令本港在硬件上更有優勢，有助打造香港成為倫敦金屬交易所在亞洲的重要交割樞紐。三個新增倉庫可即時投入運作，為業者參與國際金屬交易提供高效的交割選項，同時帶動香港海運及其他服務的發展。」

他續說：「《施政報告》也提出其他發展大宗商品交易的措施，當中包括成立由財政司司長領導的大宗商品策略委員會；港交所將深化與廣州期貨交易所及內地其他大宗商品市場的聯通發展；以及政府於明年上半年修例，為大宗商品貿易商落戶香港提供半稅優惠等，務求在軟硬件上相互配合，為長遠發展做好整體布局。政府將積極與業界合作，盡快落實有關措施。」

倫敦金屬交易所今年一月將香港納入為其全球倉庫網絡內的許可交付地點，並開始接受倉庫營運商申請許可，以儲存倫敦金屬交易所註冊品牌的金屬。"

SFST welcomes LME's approval of three additional approved warehouses,2025-09-22 17:00,2025-09-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200492.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, today (September 22) welcomed the approval by the London Metal Exchange (LME), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), of the applications to designate three warehouses in Yuen Long as approved warehouses. This decision demonstrates the strong industry support for the policy direction to promote commodity trading as announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", further enhancing Hong Kong's commodity trading ecosystem and consolidating its status as an international financial, shipping and trading centre.

  Mr Hui said, ""The Chief Executive raised in his 2025 Policy Address to continuously develop Hong Kong's commodity trading ecosystem, including support for the sector in setting up more approved warehouses. Relevant government bureaux and departments have been maintaining close communication with industry stakeholders and providing appropriate assistance on technical matters. The expansion of the LME's storage facilities in Hong Kong is a positive response to the policy direction set out in the Policy Address. In less than nine months since Hong Kong's inclusion in the LME's global warehousing network, the total number of LME-approved warehouses has now increased to 11, including the eight previously approved. This strengthens Hong Kong's advantage in infrastructure and reinforces our position as a key LME delivery hub in Asia. The three new warehouses are ready for immediate operation, providing efficient delivery options to market participants in international metal trading, while also driving the development of Hong Kong's shipping and related services.""

  He added, ""The Policy Address also proposed other measures to develop commodity trading, including the establishment of the Strategic Committee on Commodities led by the Financial Secretary; deepening of the HKEX's connections with the Guangzhou Futures Exchange and other commodity markets on the Mainland; and the Government's plan to amend legislation in the first half of next year to provide half-rate tax concessions for commodity traders to set up businesses in Hong Kong. These initiatives aim to co-ordinate efforts in both hardware and software in order to lay an overall framework for long-term development. The Government will actively collaborate with the trade to expedite the implementation of these measures.""

  The LME included Hong Kong as an approved delivery point within its global warehousing network in January this year, and began accepting applications from warehouse operators to become approved warehouses of LME-registered brands of metals.

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-09-22 16:45,2025-09-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200602.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 22) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From September 14 to 20, the CHP recorded three community-acquired LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


an 84-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Kowloon City District;
a 68-year-old female patient with good past health living in Tsuen Wan District; and
a 61-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Tai Po District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that all three cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of September 20, 124 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

  
âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms.

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-09-22 16:45,2025-09-22 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200601.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（九月二十二日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在九月十四日至二十日期間，衞生防護中心錄得三宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案。詳情如下：


84歲女病人，有長期病患，居於九龍城區；
68歲女病人，過往健康良好，居於荃灣區；及
61歲女病人，有長期病患，居於大埔區。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示三宗個案全部屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這些個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至九月二十日，今年錄得124宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

評論

政府發言人表示，八月消費物價通脹仍然處於輕微水平。基本綜合消費物價指數按年上升1.1%，較上月1.0%微升。各主要組成項目的價格壓力大致受控。

展望將來，本地成本和外圍價格壓力應大致可控，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。

On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of increase in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending August 2025 was 0.3%, and that for the 3-month period ending July 2025 was 0.2%. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of increase were 0.2% and 0.1%.

Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.5%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively in August 2025, as compared to 1.5%, 0.9% and 0.6% respectively in July 2025.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending August 2025, the average monthly rates of change in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.3% respectively. The corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending July 2025 were 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending August 2025 were all 0.2%, and the corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending July 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.0% respectively.

Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in August 2025 for transport (2.5%), alcoholic drinks and tobacco (1.8%), housing (1.7%), miscellaneous services (1.5%), meals out and takeaway food (1.3%), electricity, gas and water (0.6%), and miscellaneous goods (0.1%).

For the 12 months ending August 2025, the Composite CPI was on average 1.5% higher than that in the preceding 12-month period. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.0%, 1.4% and 1.2% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed modest in August. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.1% over a year earlier, edging up from 1.0% in the preceding month. Price pressures on various major components remained generally contained.

Looking ahead, pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check. Overall inflation should remain modest in the near term.

CE meets Secretary of Party Leadership Group and Prosecutor General of Supreme People's Procuratorate (with photo),2025-09-22 16:30,2025-09-22 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200553.htm,"  The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, met with the Secretary of the Party Leadership Group and Prosecutor General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Mr Ying Yong, at Government House today (September 22) to exchange views on issues of mutual concern. The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, also attended the meeting.

  Mr Lee welcomed Mr Ying and his delegation to Hong Kong to attend the 15th China-ASEAN Prosecutors-General Conference. He expressed gratitude to the Central Government and the Supreme People's Procuratorate for supporting Hong Kong in organising this high-level conference for the first time, which further consolidates Hong Kong's role as a regional hub for legal exchanges and fully demonstrates the unique position and advantages of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, having the strong support of the country while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world.

  Mr Lee noted that the theme of this year's conference is ""Combatting Money Laundering and Corruption, and Recovering Assets in the Technological Age"". As an international financial, shipping, and trade centre, Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction within the country, with its legal system aligned with most major financial centres around the world. While maintaining a highly open international market, Hong Kong attaches great importance to safeguarding the integrity of its financial system and has consistently adhered to international standards in its anti-money laundering systems and measures. The Department of Justice has also established a dedicated sub-division to handle technology crimes and digital evidence, proactively addressing the challenges brought by technological advancements.

  Mr Lee said that Hong Kong has been integrating into the overall national development. The Department of Justice is committed to promoting ""soft connectivity"" between local prosecutors and representatives of procuratorates across the Mainland, deepening co-operation in areas such as mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, training of prosecutorial personnel, and expert exchanges, to effectively combat cross-border crimes. The HKSAR Government will continue to deepen co-operation with the Mainland in prosecution, contributing to the country's construction of the rule of law."

李家超表示，本屆會議的主題為「數字時代打擊洗錢、腐敗犯罪及資金追繳」。香港作為國際金融、航運、貿易中心，是國家境內唯一實行普通法的司法管轄區，法律制度與全球多個主要金融中心接軌。香港在保持國際化市場高度開放的同時，十分重視保障金融體系完整，在打擊洗錢的制度和措施方面一直恪守國際標準，律政司亦設有科技罪行的分科，專責處理科技罪行和數碼證據，主動應對科技進步帶來的挑戰。

李家超說，香港一直積極融入國家發展大局，律政司全力推動本地檢控官與內地各地檢察院代表進行檢控人才「軟聯通」，在刑事司法協助、檢察人員培訓、專家交流等方面深化合作，以有效打擊跨境犯罪。特區政府會繼續與內地深化檢察領域的合作，為國家的法治建設作出貢獻。"

The fifth phase of the operation commenced in mid-September this year, and Hong Kong Customs detected two suspected cases of illegally importing animals. Six suspected illegally imported animals with an estimated market value of about $20,000 were seized.

On September 15, Hong Kong Customs at Sha Tau Kok spotted a woman pushing a bike and entering Hong Kong through the Chung Ying Street Checkpoint from the Mainland side of Chung Ying Street. Customs officers then took action and found a cat inside a pet cage placed at the front basket of the bike and a dog inside the woman's bag. The 56-year-old woman was subsequently arrested.

In the second case, Hong Kong Customs officers at Sha Tau Kok, acting on intelligence analysis, intercepted a 61-year-old woman pushing a bike to enter Hong Kong from Chung Ying Street on the Mainland side on September 17. Four suspected illegally imported cats were found in a nylon bag placed at the rear basket of the bike, and she was immediately arrested.

Investigations into the two cases are ongoing, and the six animals have been handed over to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department for follow-up action.

  As a government department specifically responsible for tackling smuggling, Customs will continue to enhance co-operation and intelligence exchanges with other law enforcement agencies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to disrupt relevant crimes.

Customs reminds the public that importing animals into Hong Kong without a valid permit is an offence.

Under the Rabies Regulation, any person found guilty of illegally importing animals, carcasses or animal products is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for one year upon conviction."

香港的產業結構正在轉型，引進和發展新興產業是香港特區政府的重要工作，而很多新興產業需要透過香港與大灣區深化協同發展，才能互惠共贏。香港在大灣區建設中肩負引領帶動的重任，我們將繼續加強與廣東、澳門的互利合作。在上星期發表的《施政報告》中，行政長官便提到積極推進香港國際機場東莞空港中心的發展，內地貨物可在東莞完成安檢及收貨，使用水路直接運到香港國際機場上機，大大降低運作成本，是大灣區合作的成功典範項目。我們期望透過不同政策及措施的落實，締造更多在大灣區的商機。

大灣區的龐大市場機遇和策略性發展是融入國家發展大局的最佳切入點，能為工商界的青年朋友帶來黃金機會。今年的《施政報告》就不同行業勾劃了未來的發展藍圖，讓青年朋友可以在更寬闊、多元的舞台上大展宏圖、實現抱負。

粵港澳大灣區企業家聯盟成立至今已經踏入第八載，一直致力凝聚商界力量，促進粵港澳企業交流合作和科技創新，並且支持青年在大灣區發展。政府同樣十分着重為香港建立人才庫，一方面我們積極吸引人才來港，同時致力培育人才及青年發展。政府除了繼續推展已有的計劃外，亦會推行新措施，例如將會推出青年人才培養計劃，為青年提供更多參與國際組織實習和國際會議的機會，從而能擴闊國際視野，更好裝備青年為國家、為香港作出貢獻。

最後，我期望未來將出現更多大灣區傑出青年企業家，為大灣區高質量發展貢獻力量，並再次向所有獲獎的青年企業家表示衷心的祝賀，你們前途無限，多謝各位。"

蔡冠深主席（粵港澳大灣區企業家聯盟主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興通過視頻參與第六屆粵港澳大灣區傑出青年企業家頒獎典禮，與大家一同恭賀各位得獎的青年企業家。我首先祝願各位青年企業家的事業竿頭日進，更上層樓。

粵港澳大灣區企業家聯盟自成立以來，積極促進粵港澳三地企業的交流合作，推動科技創新和扶持青年創業。聯盟幫助青年一展抱負，貢獻大灣區高質量發展，我肯定聯盟的工作。

青年是國家和香港的未來，是推動社會與經濟長遠發展的重要力量。粵港澳大灣區建設是習近平主席親自謀劃、親自部署、親自推動的國家戰略，是香港更好融入國家發展大局的最佳切入點，為廣大青年提供了廣闊的發展空間和無限的可能性。

特區政府積極推動青年把握大灣區龐大的機遇，敢於創新，實踐夢想。去年，特區政府在青年發展基金下推出新一輪的粵港澳大灣區青年創業資助計劃，為青年創業團隊提供資金支持和創業支援服務。

創業資助計劃至今已成功培育超過200個青年創業團隊，其中70多個團隊已落戶深圳、廣州等大灣區內地城市，為區域發展注入源源不絕的動能。

此外，由粵港兩地政府成立的大灣區香港青年創新創業基地聯盟，至今已舉辦了約280項活動，為創業青年提供全面的資訊和支援，幫助他們拓展網路，提升競爭力。

特區政府全力支持由中央部委與廣東省政府在今年舉辦的首屆粵港澳大灣區創業大賽。大賽的反應十分熱烈，參賽項目總數突破7 000，當中包括超過1 400個來自香港的參賽項目，充分展現了香港青年勇於挑戰自我的精神，令人鼓舞。

我鼓勵更多有志創業的青年在大灣區的廣闊舞台發揮所長，開拓事業。我有信心，粵港澳大灣區企業家聯盟會繼續與政府攜手合作，支持香港青年創新創業，為大灣區建設貢獻香港力量。

最後，我再次恭賀得獎的青年企業家，並祝願粵港澳大灣區企業家聯盟會務蒸蒸日上，在座各位身體健康，工作順利，謝謝大家。"
Steering committee on handling extreme weather releases latest information (with photo),2025-09-22 15:45,2025-09-22 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200591.htm,"The steering committee on handling extreme weather, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following information today (September 22) in response to the latest assessment and forecast on Super Typhoon Ragasa by the Hong Kong Observatory.

According to the current forecast by the Observatory, the local weather is expected to deteriorate rapidly later tomorrow (September 23). The Observatory will consider issuing the Gale or Storm Signal No. 8 between 1pm and 4pm tomorrow. The weather will be persistently adverse on Wednesday (September 24). Gale to storm force winds will prevail locally, and winds may reach hurricane force offshore and on high ground. There will be frequent heavy squally showers and thunderstorms. Under the influence of significant storm surge, the sea level over coastal areas by then may be similar to that during Hato in 2017 and Mangkhut in 2018. Members of the public are advised to prepare immediately for high winds and flooding.

Considering the aforementioned forecast by the Observatory, to ensure students' safety and to avoid students leaving the school when the weather may rapidly deteriorate, the Education Bureau (EDB) announces that classes in all schools, including secondary schools, primary schools, special schools, kindergartens, kindergarten-cum-child care centres and evening schools, will be suspended tomorrow and the following day (September 24). During the class suspension period, schools will not accept paper applications for discretionary places under the Primary One Admission (POA) 2026. The deadline for submitting paper applications has been extended to September 30 (Tuesday). Parents may also choose to submit e-applications via the POA e-Platform (epoa.edb.gov.hk) on or before September 26 (Friday). Details are available on the EDB's website.

In view of the forecast by the Observatory that the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 3 will be issued tonight, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) advises members of the public not to take their children or family members to units providing child care centre services, services under the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project, and after-school care programmes for pre-primary or primary school children, elderly services centres, day pre-school rehabilitation service units or day rehabilitation units including sheltered workshops, integrated vocational rehabilitation services centres, integrated vocational training centres and day activity centres. These centres and services units will, however, remain open during their normal operating hours to serve those whose families cannot provide alternative care for them. Members of the public who have the need for the services mentioned may contact the centres or services units concerned in advance. When the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or above is hoisted, the aforementioned day child care services units, centres providing after-school care programmes, day rehabilitation units, elderly day services centres and SWD welfare services units will not open.

District Offices have initiated relevant response measures. In view of the possible threats that Ragasa may pose to Hong Kong, District Offices will advance the opening of temporary shelters at 8am tomorrow for people in need. District Offices will closely monitor the situation, and if necessary, individual temporary shelters will commence operation earlier today. The Home Affairs Department has also activated a round-the-clock hotline (2572 8427) at noon today for public enquiries on the relevant information and will continue to release information on the operation of temporary shelters through different channels.

In addition, District Offices have co-ordinated with relevant departments and organisations to enhance preparedness, setting up sandbags and water-stop boards, among others. District Council members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams are mobilised to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to make necessary preparations. Residents in flood-prone areas are advised to stay away from their homes or stay at temporary shelters.

The Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre (EMSC) under the Security Bureau was fully activated at 10.30am today, more than 24 hours earlier than normal, in order to achieve the objective of ""early planning and early intervention"". Utilising the Common Operational Picture, directorate officers of relevant departments at the EMSC conduct real-time citywide monitoring and integrate updates from various departments to swiftly assess risks and formulate response plans and measures.

Various emergency response teams, including the Fire Services Department, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Civil Aid Service and the Auxiliary Medical Service, are on standby and have completed all necessary preparatory work. Sufficient manpower has been deployed to handle possible emergencies during heavy rainstorms and high winds, and to provide assistance to those in need.

The Government will closely monitor the situation in the city to assess whether to initiate the Government-wide Mobilisation mechanism after the typhoon for providing emergency support. The Civil Service Bureau has reminded all 77 bureaux and departments (B/Ds) to remain highly vigilant and stand ready to form quick response units at any time to provide support. Each B/D has also drawn up their lists of designated personnel for mobilisation and made duty rotation arrangements in advance.

It is expected that Ragasa may pose serious threats to Hong Kong, Members of the public should be well prepared for the continued severe weather conditions over the next two days, including implementing emergency, wind and flooding prevention measures, with a view to reducing the risk of property damage and casualties. The Government also reminds residents in flood-prone areas and those who are staying in temporary structures, such as rooftop houses and squatter huts near slopes, to stay away from their homes or stay at temporary shelters. It also recommends that vehicles parked outdoors be parked indoors.

Under the cross-departmental co-ordination by the steering committee, various government departments have completed all necessary preparatory work and response plans, served with their dedication to duty, and combined efforts to safeguard the lives and property of the public as well as public safety, with a view to minimising the threats and impact of the storm. The public is urged to stay alert and continue to pay attention to the latest news released by the Government."
日本進口水產的檢測情況,2025-09-22 15:35,2025-09-22 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200576.htm,"因應日本政府單方面決定把福島核電站核污水排放大海，食物環境衞生署署長已發出《食物安全命令》，禁止源自日本10（都）縣的水產、海鹽和海藻食品進口本港，受禁（都）縣包括東京、福島、茨城、宮城、千葉、群馬、栃木、新潟、長野和埼玉。

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由九月十九日中午截至今日（九月二十二日）中午，食安中心已在過去三日（包括過去的星期六及星期日）對294個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對150個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

由二○二三年八月二十四日起至今日中午，食安中心及漁護署分別檢測了共167 221個日本進口食物樣本（包括109 314個水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽樣本）及共37 754個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。"
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-09-22 15:35,2025-09-22 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200577.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on September 19 to noon today (September 22), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 294 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website
(www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 167 221 samples of food imported from Japan (including 109 314 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 37 754 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."
"Report on ""Long-term Investing in Hong Kong: Developments and Opportunities in a Digital Economy"" (with photo)",2025-09-22 15:30,2025-09-22 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200408.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR), the research arm of the Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF), today (September 22) released a new Applied Research report, titled ""Long-term Investing in Hong Kong: Developments and Opportunities in a Digital Economy"".

The report, building upon the HKIMR's prior research on demographic changes and long-term asset markets, provides a comprehensive and updated analysis of Hong Kong's long-term investing landscape and opportunities within the context of an evolving digital economy. The report covers two surveys that were commissioned by the HKIMR. The first survey, carried out in collaboration with the Investor and Financial Education Council, explored Hong Kong residents' long-term investment decisions. The second survey, administered in collaboration with a consulting firm, focused on local market participants to gain insight into their perspectives on product development, distribution strategies, and the adoption of technology. 

The study highlights that while Hong Kong residents exhibit a strong foundation for basic financial knowledge, there is a need for greater awareness of specific financial products, particularly those related to long-term investing and financial planning. As for products, Hong Kong already possesses a diverse suite of globally competitive accumulation products. However, 67 per cent of the surveyed market participants saw the crucial need to increase the supply of decumulation product options to accommodate their customers' demand for long-term financial planning.

The study also reflects that digital adoption among both survey groups is high. In the study, 72 per cent of surveyed residents reported using digital financial services in the past year, and about 70 per cent of the surveyed market participants reported they are currently adopting or plan to adopt mobile and web platforms to distribute long-term financial products. Based on these survey findings, the study suggests some considerations to foster a healthy long-term investment ecosystem in Hong Kong. Among those, embracing frontier technologies is key to drive innovative product and services, increase cost efficiency, and further enhance product distribution to support more effective long-term investing and financial planning.

  ""The trend of population ageing continues, making it imperative to prioritise long-term investing. The insights of this report can be helpful for market participants as they navigate existing challenges and foster business opportunities that contribute to developing a more comprehensive and healthy long-term investment ecosystem in Hong Kong,"" said the Chief Executive Officer of the AoF and Executive Director of the HKIMR, Mr Enoch Fung.

The report is available on the AoF/HKIMR website.

金融學院轄下負責研究工作的香港貨幣及金融研究中心（研究中心）今日（九月二十二日）發表題為「香港長線投資：數字經濟下的發展及機遇」的應用金融研究報告。

本報告以研究中心過往對人口結構轉變及長線資產市場的研究為基礎，並在數字經濟日新月異的背景下，對香港的長線投資格局及機遇作出全面及最新的分析。報告涵蓋由研究中心委托進行的兩項調查：調查一是與投資者及理財教育委員會合作，探討香港居民的長線投資決策；調查二則是與諮詢公司合作，聚焦本地市場參與者於產品開發、分銷策略及技術應用情況的見解。

研究結果顯示，儘管香港居民具備良好的基礎理財知識，但仍需要加深對特定金融產品的了解，尤其是與長線投資及財務規劃有關的產品。至於產品方面，香港市場上已存在不少多樣化及具有全球競爭力的財富累積產品，但67%受訪機構認為，市場仍需要更多具備財富提取功能的產品選擇，以滿足客戶對長線財務規劃的需求。

研究結果亦反映，兩項調查的受訪者數碼採用率日趨普及。72%受訪居民表示過去一年曾使用數碼金融服務，而約70%受訪市場參與者表示，他們正在或計劃透過流動和網絡平台分銷長線理財產品。根據調查所得，研究報告進一步探討業界如何促進香港長線投資生態圈的健康發展。其中，採用前沿技術是推動創新產品和服務、提高成本效益、優化產品分銷，以提升長線投資和財務規劃方面發展的關鍵。

金融學院行政總裁兼研究中心執行董事馮殷諾表示：「人口高齡化趨勢持續，長線投資成為當務之急。本報告的研究成果將為市場參與者提供有價值的參考，幫助他們應對現有的挑戰、把握商機，從而推動香港長線投資生態圈朝着更全面、更健康的方向發展。」

主席，各位委員：

大家好。今日我想向各位委員介紹《行政長官2025年施政報告》中有關文創產業發展的主要政策措施。

文化體育及旅遊局轄下的文創產業發展處（文創處）會繼續推展旗艦年度盛事香港時裝薈，透過匯集不同本地時裝設計盛事，和引入嶄新元素和周邊活動，將香港打造成為亞洲時裝設計中心。第一屆香港時裝薈在二○二四年底圓滿舉行。我們會在今年十一月底至十二月初舉辦第二屆香港時裝薈，除了展示本地和海外設計師的高級訂製服裝、牛仔服飾、晚裝等之外，亦會展現跨藝術領域合作及進行其他周邊活動；我們更會聯乘巴黎時裝周和米蘭時裝周，推進數碼時裝和永續時尚發展，帶動更多產業合作、創新和業務機會。

電影方面，作為香港文創產業的重要支柱，我們一直透過電影發展基金支援電影業發展，提升電影製作的質和量。過去三年，透過電影發展基金資助的電影佔香港電影票房接近三成。政府日後會繼續與業界緊密溝通，為香港和國際業界搭建交流、配對及溝通平台，促進電影業發展。

在推動文化知識產權合作方面，文創處正積極促進跨界別、跨文化藝術領域的合作，希望發揮協同效應，推進孵化本地文化知識產權；我們亦會透過繼續支持優化亞洲知識產權交易平台，加入更多市場資訊，並支援本地原創產品打入內地及國際市場，拓展商機。

未來，我們會繼續積極推動文創產業的發展。歡迎大家就《施政報告》的內容向我們提出問題。多謝主席。"

主席、各位委員：

大家好！很高興出席今天的資訊科技及廣播事務委員會會議，簡介創新科技及工業局在今年《施政報告》的一些有關措施。

推動科技創新和產業創新融合是香港未來發展的大方向。二○二五年《施政報告》宣布的一系列新措施，緊扣《香港創新科技發展藍圖》（《藍圖》）提出的四大發展方向，與香港建設國際創科中心的目標相呼應，當中包括以下重點。

首先，在「推動數字經濟發展，建設智慧香港」方面，我們會善用香港在科研、數據及人才方面的優勢，加大推動人工智能（AI）和數據科學產業發展，並以「加強基建，推動應用導向」為重心，促進AI在各行各業廣泛深度融合，推進AI+發展。

在科研和人才方面，我們將於二○二六年成立香港人工智能研發院；而30億元前沿科技研究支援計劃亦將於短期內接受申請，資助八大院校吸引國際科研頂尖人才來港進行包括AI在內的前沿科技研究。

在數據方面，數碼港人工智能超算中心將於年內進一步提升算力水平，而我們亦已推出30億元人工智能資助計劃，支撐本地院校、研發機構和企業的大規模算力需求及AI應用。

在推動AI公務應用方面，政府會成立由政務司副司長領導的「AI效能提升組」，統籌和指導政府部門有效於工作中應用AI技術。我們亦會推出「AI工具箱」，推動部門在數據分析、客戶服務及文書等工作上廣泛應用AI，並協助部門推出「AI旗艦項目」，作為示範案例，引發其他部門善用AI，加快公共服務革新。

為支援中小企應用AI，我們會優化數碼港數碼轉型支援先導計劃，以配對資助賦能中小企應用AI及網絡安全方案，提升競爭力及資訊保安。

就「積極融入國家發展大局，同時鞏固香港國際化優勢」方面，我們會於明年繼續舉行世界互聯網大會亞太峰會和香港國際創科展，鞏固香港作為國際創科中心的領先地位。

今年的《施政報告》以「深化改革心繫民生發揮優勢同創未來」為題。我們會繼續循着《藍圖》的發展方向，善用香港優勢，因地制宜全力推動AI作為香港未來發展的核心產業，賦能市民和企業解鎖AI+發展的機遇。

我的簡介完畢，稍後歡迎各委員提問。謝謝主席。"
"Film Archive to screen 4K digitally restored version of ""Feast of a Rich Family"" in support of World Day for Audiovisual Heritage (with photos)",2025-09-22 15:00,2025-09-22 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200253.htm,"  In support of World Day for Audiovisual Heritage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Hong Kong Film Archive (HKFA) of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department will present the 4K digitally restored version of ""Feast of a Rich Family"" (1959) at the Cinema of the HKFA at 2pm on October 26 (Sunday).

  The film tells the story of a nouveau-riche man, played by Ng Cho-fan, who brings his elderly father out of the slums and invites guests to a lavish banquet under the pretext of celebrating his father's beard, in order to flaunt his wife's new diamond ring. Through a series of absurd and farcical scenes, the film satirises the moral decay of the wealthy and the sycophantic behaviour of those scrambling to curry favour with them, while extolling working-class virtues.

  ""Feast of a Rich Family"" was produced by the South China Film Industry Workers Union to raise funds for establishing a permanent office. Featuring Cantonese and Mandarin cinema icons, including Ng, Mui Yee, Cheung Ying, Pak Yin, Cheung Wood-yau, Hsia Moon and Shek Hwei, the film stands as a symbol of unity, collaboration and charity within the Hong Kong film industry.

  With the Union's donation of film materials in 2024, the HKFA undertook the 4K digital restoration of the film, allowing this star-studded classic to be presented to audiences with enhanced visual and audio quality.

  The programme will be accompanied by a post-screening talk by scholar Dr Lo Wai-luk and film critic Grace Ng.

  The film is in Cantonese with Chinese and English subtitles. Tickets priced at $60 will be available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk) from September 26(Friday). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288. For programme enquiries, please call 2739 2139 or visit the website of the HKFA at www.filmarchive.gov.hk/en/web/hkfa/2025/av-day/pe-event-2025-av-day.html.

  In 2005, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization designated October 27 of every year as World Day for Audiovisual Heritage. It promotes awareness of the importance of preserving audio-visual documents from the past, which play an integral role in recording local and regional cultures."

電影講述吳楚帆飾演的暴發戶為炫耀妻子的新鑽戒，把老父從貧民窟找出來，以「留鬚請飲」的名目宴請賓客，透過一幕幕荒唐鬧劇諷刺富人的腐敗和眾人爭相巴結的勢利，並頌揚勞動階層道德情操的高尚。

《豪門夜宴》由華南電影工作者聯合會（影聯會）出品，以籌款建立會址。電影由吳楚帆、梅綺、張瑛、白燕、張活游、夏夢和石慧等國、粵語片明星演出，是香港電影界團結一致、群策群力的象徵。

二○二四年，資料館獲得影聯會捐贈《豪門夜宴》的菲林素材，並展開4K數碼修復工作，讓這部陣容鼎盛的經典電影，以更佳的聲畫質素，重現觀眾眼前。

節目設映後談，由學者盧偉力博士和影評人藍天雲擔任講者。

影片為粵語，設中、英文字幕。票價60元，九月二十六日（星期五）起於城市售票網（www.urbtix.hk）發售，電話購票請致電3166 1288。有關節目詳情，請瀏覽資料館網頁（www.filmarchive.gov.hk/tc/web/hkfa/2025/av-day/pe-event-2025-av-day.html）或致電2739 2139。

聯合國教育、科學及文化組織自二○○五年起，把每年的十月二十七日定為「世界視聽遺產日」，奠定視聽遺產作為地域文化的重要地位，藉此加深大眾對視聽遺產保育的認識。"
Hospital Authority service arrangements announced,2025-09-22 15:00,2025-09-22 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200382.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson announced the following service arrangements for public hospitals today (September 22):

With Super Typhoon Ragasa edging closer to Hong Kong, the HA has made advance preparations and implemented special measures to ensure all acute services remain unaffected during the storm period.

  ""All acuteservices of public hospitals, including services of accident and emergency departments, inpatient services and emergency surgeries will remain as normal. The HA has allocated additional manpower, beds, medical utilities and supplies for possible emergencies during the storm,"" the HA spokesperson said.

Concerning the safety of patients and staff members, non-emergency services of public hospitals, including services of general out-patient clinics, specialist out-patient clinics, allied health (such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, etc), geriatric day hospitals and psychiatric day hospitals, ambulatory services, non-emergent laboratory tests (such as blood tests and returning of specimens) and diagnostic services will be suspended when the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or above is in force, with details as follows:


Non-emergency services of public hospitals will remain as normal tomorrow morning (September 23). When the Hong Kong Observatory issuesthe Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or above, all non-emergency services will be suspended. The public is advised to pay close attention to the latest weather information. The HA will announce the arrangements for servicestomorrow afternoon in due course; and
All non-emergency services will be suspended on Wednesday (September 24).


The HA anticipates that a large number of backlogged cases will have to be handled after the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is cancelled. In view of potentially continuing adverse weather conditions, some non-emergency services may still be affected. The HA will announce arrangements for services to be available on Thursday (September 25) in due course.

The HA reminds that non-urgent patients should avoid visiting public hospitals or clinics during the storm or adverse weather conditions for the sake of safety. ""Public hospitals will resume all affected non-emergency services as soon as possible after the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is cancelled. Affected patients will be notified gradually in the coming week to reschedule their appointments. Patients do not need to be concerned. All clusters have also set up hotlines for patients' enquiries (see attached table),"" the spokesperson supplemented.

Enhanced inspections have been carried out at various locations within public hospitals, including potential flood-prone areas, drainage systems and trees. Furthermore, contractors of HA construction sites have been instructed to implement proper reinforcement and safety precautionary measures against strong winds and heavy rain to minimise the impact of severe weather.

The HA Major Incident Control Centre will closely monitor the operations of all hospitals and maintain close communication with relevant government departments to ensure public hospital services remain unaffected during adverse weather conditions.

按照天文台目前預測，本港明日（九月二十三日）稍後天氣開始急速轉壞，天文台會考慮在明日下午一時至四時改發八號烈風或暴風信號。星期三（九月二十四日）天氣持續惡劣，吹烈風至暴風，離岸及高地可能達颶風，有頻密狂風大驟雨及雷暴。而受顯著風暴潮影響，預計沿岸水位可能與二○一七年的天鴿及二○一八年的山竹相若。市民請立即採取防風、防水浸措施。

考慮到天文台上述預測，為確保學生安全，避免學生於天氣可能急速轉壞的情況下離開學校，教育局宣布所有學校（包括中學、小學、特殊學校、幼稚園、幼稚園暨幼兒中心及夜校）明日及後日（九月二十四日）將停課。停課期間，學校暫停接收二○二六年度小一入學自行分配學位的紙本申請。有關紙本申請的截止日期延至九月三十日（星期二）。家長亦可選擇於九月二十六日（星期五）或之前透過「小一入學電子平台」（epoa.edb.gov.hk）遞交電子申請，詳情載於教育局網頁。

而由於天文台今晚會發出三號熱帶氣旋警告信號，社會福利署（社署）勸喻市民明日不要送子女或家人到提供幼兒中心、鄰里支援幼兒照顧計劃及學前兒童或小學生課餘託管服務的單位、長者服務中心、日間學前康復服務單位或包括庇護工場、綜合職業康復服務中心、綜合職業訓練中心及展能中心在內的日間康復服務單位，但各中心及服務單位在其正常辦公時間內，仍會繼續開放予有需要人士。市民如需要使用相關服務，可先與中心或服務單位聯絡。當八號或以上熱帶氣旋警告信號生效後，上述提供日間幼兒照顧／青少年／長者／康復服務的中心或服務單位及所有社署轄下福利單位將不會開放。

各區民政事務處已啓動相關應對工作，因應樺加沙可能為香港帶來的威脅，各區民政事務處將會提早於明日上午八時開放臨時庇護中心，供有需要市民入住。各區民政事務處會密切留意情況，如有需要，個別臨時庇護中心亦會今日提早運作。民政事務總署亦於今日中午設立一條二十四小時緊急事故熱線2572 8427供市民查詢相關消息，並會持續透過不同途徑發布臨時庇護中心的運作資訊。

此外，各區民政事務處已協調相關部門和機構加強防備，設置沙包和擋水板等，亦動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊向區內易受水浸影響的居民發放最新的天氣資訊，提醒他們做好準備，以及勸喻居住水浸風險較高地區的居民及早遷離居所，或到臨時庇護中心暫避。

保安局轄下的緊急事故監察及支援中心已提前於今日上午十時三十分全面啓動，較一般情況提早逾24小時開始運作，以達致早部署、早介入的應急目標。中心由相關部門的首長級人員透過聯合運作平台實時密切監察全港市面情況，掌握並整合各部門的實時資訊，以迅速評估風險並制定相應的應對方案及措施。

各緊急救援部隊包括消防處、警務處、民眾安全服務隊及醫療輔助隊亦全員候命，做好全面應急準備。各部門已部署足夠人手，以應付在暴雨及強風期間可能發生的緊急事故，並為有需要幫助的人士提供協助。

政府會密切監察市面情況，評估是否需要在颱風過後啓動「全政府動員」機制以提供應急支援。公務員事務局已提醒全數77個政策局和部門保持高度警覺，隨時組成應急隊伍提供支援。各政策局和部門亦已預先制定動員人員名單及輪值安排。

預計樺加沙會為香港帶來嚴重威脅，市民應盡快為未來兩天持續惡劣天氣做好應急、防風、防水浸準備，減少財產損失與人員傷亡的風險。政府再次提醒居於水浸風險較高地區的居民，以及身處臨時搭建物，例如天台屋或斜坡附近寮屋的市民及早遷離居所，或到臨時庇護中心暫避；亦建議停泊在戶外的車輛另選室內位置停泊。

在督導委員會的跨部門統籌下，各政府部門已做好準備和應變部署，堅守崗位，上下一心，致力保障市民的生命財產和公共安全，盡力減輕風暴帶來的威脅和影響。市民請保持警覺，並繼續密切留意各政府部門持續發放的最新消息。"

勞工及福利局局長在立法會人力事務委員會政策簡報會就《行政長官2025年施政報告》作出簡報的書面發言稿（只有中文）,2025-09-22 11:55,2025-09-22 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200307.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局（勞福局）局長孫玉菡今日（九月二十二日）上午在立法會人力事務委員會政策簡報會就《行政長官2025年施政報告》有關勞工及人力範疇政策措施作出簡報的書面發言稿：

主席：

我重點介紹《行政長官2025年施政報告》（《施政報告》）及《施政報告》附篇內，由勞工及福利局負責有關勞工及人力範疇的主要措施。

輸入人才政策

政府自二○二二年年底起積極推行多項「搶人才、留人才」措施，成效顯著。截至今年八月，已成功吸引超過23萬名來自全球不同界別的精英來港工作及發展。其中，高端人才通行證計劃針對高收入人士及世界頂尖院校畢業生，至今已接獲逾14萬宗申請，約11萬宗獲批，近10萬人已抵港。首批簽證已陸續到期，續簽情況理想，申請續簽率達55%。根據續簽數據及跟進調查，估算該計劃每年為香港帶來可觀的直接經濟貢獻，進一步鞏固香港作為國際高端人才集聚高地的地位。值得一提的是，來港人才以年輕群體為主，他們不僅為本地注入創新動力與多元技能，亦有助紓緩人口高齡化的挑戰，成為推動香港社會與經濟持續發展的重要力量。

政府會動態監察香港人力變化，不時因應人才需求檢視人才清單，以及在引入指定技術工種專才來港安排推行一年後進行檢討。

容許全日制非本地研究生及本科生參與兼職工作

政府將繼續免除逾七萬名在港就讀的全日制非本地研究生及本科生參與兼職工作的限制，讓他們累積本地職場經驗，深化對香港的認識，並提升他們畢業後留港發展的能力及意欲。

加強招攬和支援人才工作

香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）一直致力對外宣傳香港優勢及招攬人才措施，並為來港人才提供全方位一站式支援服務。為進一步打造香港作為國際高端人才集聚高地，人才辦會加強推廣及招攬人才的工作，繼續到訪內地、亞太、歐洲、中東和北美洲地區，並強化與內地城市合作，一同進行海外宣傳活動，推廣香港優勢及區域發展機遇，招攬國際人才。人才辦將於明年三月舉辦全球人才高峰會周，突顯香港作為國際人才樞紐和國家人才門戶的優勢。此外，人才辦會持續優化各項人才服務，舉辦更多專題研討會、招聘會、工作坊及共融活動，協助外來人才落戶香港。

革新僱員再培訓局

去年《施政報告》提出革新僱員再培訓局（再培訓局），提升角色和定位至為整體勞動人口提供技能為本的培訓課程和策略，推動全民持續進修及技能提升。再培訓局已於今年初起加強培訓及職涯規劃等服務，包括不再設學歷上限。再培訓局亦已初步勾劃未來三年的改革路線圖，主要工作包括強化行業諮詢機制，着重識別重點技能的需求和缺口，制訂以技能為本的培訓框架，並與高等院校合作及導向其他培訓機構，因應技能缺口開發各類別和級別的課程。再培訓局日後也會推出獲業界認可的微證書課程，讓學員可靈活選修，並善用應用科技提供多元靈活的學習模式。

再培訓局會在今年底前全面敲定工作計劃。政府會與再培訓局推進中長期改革工作，包括更改再培訓局名稱及修訂《僱員再培訓條例》以反映其新定位等，讓機構在革新後更靈活有效地履行職能。我們的目標是在二○二七年年中前完成修例。

確保本地勞工優先就業

政府堅守本地就業優先的原則，勞工處已針對補充勞工優化計劃下輸入勞工較多的工種推出措施打擊濫用。由今年九月十八日起，經優化計劃申請輸入侍應生及初級廚師時，僱主須進行的本地招聘由四星期延長至六星期，其間必須每周參加一次在勞工處就業中心舉行的實地招聘會；並實行更嚴格的人手比例要求，由以每名申請僱主的所有職位為計算基礎，改為以申請職位為計算基礎。

勞工處將於明年上半年完成優化計劃的檢討，並於第二季公布檢討結果。此外，勞福局剛展開人力推算中期更新，會針對輸入勞工較多的行業，優先進行數據分析，幫助政府做好中長期規劃。

政府亦會加大力度打擊非法勞工，提高情報收集及跨部門聯合行動，保障本地工人的就業機會。

檢討再就業津貼試行計劃

勞工處去年七月十五日推出為期三年的再就業津貼試行計劃（再就業計劃），鼓勵40歲或以上人士重投就業市場，並同時推行中高齡就業計劃，鼓勵僱主聘用中高齡人士及提供在職培訓。截至今年八月，再就業計劃已錄得超過50 000名參加者及超過27 000宗就業個案，其中約四分之一的參加者和就業個案為60歲或以上人士。

勞工處會於明年第一季就再就業計劃進行中期檢討，配合中高齡就業計劃，探討進一步鼓勵銀齡就業的措施。

檢討法定最低工資水平

最低工資委員會正按新機制，採用方程式實行法定最低工資「一年一檢」，首個按新機制得出的法定最低工資水平預計於明年五月一日生效。

保障數碼平台工作者

政府已成立包括政府、平台公司及勞工團體代表的數碼平台行業三方小組，共同探討保障平台工作者的合適措施。經考慮相關調查結果及持份者意見，政府將於二○二六年內提交完善平台工作者工傷補償機制的立法建議，並繼續善用三方小組，就持份者關注的議題進行協商。

持續推行的措施

除上述的施政重點及新措施外，勞福局和勞工處會繼續推行文件第22至35段的工作和措施，我在此扼要介紹。

勞福局剛開展人力推算的中期更新。中期更新以二○二五年的最新情況為基準，更新對二○二八年人力情況的推算，結果預計於明年第四季公布。

為擴大職業人才庫及紓緩職業專才的人手短缺壓力，政府推出職專畢業生留港計劃（職專計劃），讓指定學年入讀職業訓練局指定全日制高級文憑課程的非本地生，於畢業後可留港一年尋找相關工作。由於職業專才人手短缺和青黃不接的情況仍然持續，考慮到試行計劃吸引到不少非本地生入讀有關行業的高級文憑，長遠有助吸納更多新人入行，政府決定延長職專計劃的試行安排，容許二○二六／二七和二○二七／二八學年另外兩批合資格非本地學生經計劃申請留港，從事與其修讀課程相關的行業。合資格課程的數目經統整後維持34個，涵蓋行業由12個增至13個，將會新增酒店及旅遊相關的兩個指定課程。

改善僱傭權益方面，《僱傭條例》下「連續性合約」的新規定將於明年一月十八日實施，讓僱員更容易享有全面僱傭權益。勞工處正為落實新「連續性合約」規定進行準備工作。

此外，政府建議調升工傷僱員可索還的醫療費最高每天限額。如獲立法會通過，新醫療費限額將於明年一月一日生效。

明年一月五日，勞工處轄下職工會登記局會實施經修訂的《職工會條例》，加強維護國家安全，並促進健全職工會管理。登記局會加強宣傳及編製參考資料，協助職工會明瞭及遵行新規定。此外，政府將動用香港賽馬會行政長官專項撥款，資助非政府機構編撰及宣傳有關香港工會百年發展的歷史資料，提升香港市民的文化自信及愛國精神。

為推廣家庭友善，勞工處將於明年首季推出新一屆《好僱主約章》，重點鼓勵及嘉許僱主實施支援育兒的家庭友善僱傭措施，協助僱員平衡工作與家庭的需要。

在加強職業安全及健康（職安健）方面，勞工處將繼續採用多管齊下的策略，加強巡查執法、宣傳推廣及教育培訓，並積極推動業界善用創新科技，深化職安健文化，提升整體職安健水平。勞工處將於今年十月起，正式使用小型無人機進行空中拍攝，加強建築工地的職安健巡查、意外調查及蒐證能力；勞工處亦會為業界研發提升職安健科技產品提供職安健法例的專業意見，便利他們引入相關產品。

此外，勞工處已修訂《密閉空間工作的安全與健康工作守則》，在守則內新增多項要求，並更新相關培訓課程內容，提升密閉空間工作的安全與健康。

結語

政府將繼續與勞資雙方及社會各界緊密合作，推行勞工及人力範疇的各項措施。我和我的同事樂於聆聽委員的意見，以及回答大家的提問。多謝主席。"

香港與阿根廷和秘魯的經濟合作關係頻繁。二○二四年，香港與阿根廷和秘魯的雙邊商品貿易總額分別達30億港元和60億港元。其中，秘魯是「一帶一路」倡議的參與經濟體，香港與秘魯的雙邊貿易在二○二○年起平均每年增長近一成，雙方亦於二○二四年簽署《自由貿易協定》，進一步促進雙向投資流動，帶動雙方經濟發展。"

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-22 06:47,2025-09-22 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200122.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 22) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."
天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-09-22 06:47,2025-09-22 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/22/P2025092200125.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月二十二日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

市民可透過以下途徑，取得更多資料：衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111）、中暑專頁、紫外線專頁；天文台「打電話問天氣」（1878 200）、最新天氣報告及預報、紫外線指​數、遠足及攀山天氣資訊；及勞工處於工作暑熱警告生效期間，對戶外工作的僱員和其僱主發布有關預防中暑措施的新聞公報。"
