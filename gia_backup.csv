天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-10-18 06:47,2025-10-18 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800172.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月十八日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

市民可透過以下途徑，取得更多資料：衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111）、中暑專頁、紫外線專頁；天文台「打電話問天氣」（1878 200）、最新天氣報告及預報、紫外線指​數、遠足及攀山天氣資訊；及勞工處於工作暑熱警告生效期間，對戶外工作的僱員和其僱主發布有關預防中暑措施的新聞公報。"
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-18 06:47,2025-10-18 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800174.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 18) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

USEE leads delegation to attend World Food Forum 2025 and AFCD and Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations sign Letter of Intent (with photos),2025-10-17 21:32,2025-10-17 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700546.htm,"The Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, led a delegation to attend the World Food Forum 2025 held by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome, Italy, on October 13. Representatives joining the visit included the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, Mr Mickey Lai.

The delegation attended various activities organised by the World Food Forum, and held meetings with the Permanent Mission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations Agencies in Rome and the FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific.

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with the FAO today (October 17, Rome time) to further strengthen knowledge exchanges between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government and the FAO, as well as to promote regional co-operation. Witnessed by Miss Wong, the Director-General of the FAO, Dr Qu Dongyu, and others, Mr Lai and the Assistant Director-General of the FAO, Dr Thanawat Tiensin, signed the LOI.

The LOI aims to achieve common objectives between the AFCD and the FAO in several areas, including:


promoting and implementing the One Health approach;
preventing and controlling transboundary animal diseases (especially avian influenza and African Swine Fever);
Reducing the Need for Antimicrobials on Farms for Sustainable Agrifood Systems Transformation (RENOFARM), and promoting research, technology and innovation in agrifood systems; and
enhancing capacity development and training in agriculture and aquaculture.


In addition, Miss Wong delivered a speech at the partnership dialogue of the Science and Innovation Forum today, introducing the innovative efforts undertaken by the HKSAR Government in support of the One Health principles within the agrifood systems.

âThe HKSAR Government will continue to maintain close communication and co-operation with the FAO to contribute further to global food security and sustainable development."
50 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-10-17 20:30,2025-10-17 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700646.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Silverwing"" and ""Rally"" , a joint operation with the Labour Department codenamed ""Rainbow"" and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"" from October 10 to yesterday (October 16). A total of 41 suspected illegal workers, eight suspected employers and a suspected aider and abettor were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations including construction sites, renovation sites and restaurants etc. Forty-one suspected illegal workers, eight suspected employers and a suspected aider and abettor were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised 11 men and 30 women, aged 24 to 58. Among them, a man was holding a recognizance form which prohibits him from taking any employment, and a man was suspected of using and being in possession of Hong Kong identity card which relates to another person. Three men and five women, aged 32 to 62, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. The suspected aider and abettor arrested was a women aged 62. An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  Apart from mounting the enforcement operation, ImmD officers and a promotional vehicle have been deployed to distribute ""Don't Employ Illegal Workers"" leaflets and convey the message to occupants and property management staffs in newly inhabited housing estates.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Moreover, after entry into the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the imported worker admitted on an employment condition must remain under the direct employment of the same employer for the specified job and in the specific workplace(s) as stipulated in the Standard Employment Contract and cannot be employed by other companies or subcontractors. Change of the employer, post or place of work (unless stipulated in the Standard Employment Contract) is not permitted. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or a identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
反非法勞工行動拘五十人（附圖）,2025-10-17 20:30,2025-10-17 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700647.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月十日至昨日（十月十六日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「銀翼行動」、「滙力行動」，聯同勞工處進行的「彩虹行動」以及聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」等。行動中共拘捕四十一名懷疑非法勞工、八名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名協助及教唆者。

反非法勞工行動中，入境處調查人員搜查多個目標地點，包括建築地盤、裝修中單位及餐廳等，共拘捕四十一名懷疑非法勞工、八名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名協助及教唆者。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為十一男三十女，年齡介乎二十四至五十八歲。當中一名男子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）及一名男子涉嫌行使及管有他人身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為三男五女，年齡介乎三十二至六十二歲。被捕的協助及教唆者為一名六十二歲女子。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

在執法的同時，入境處職員亦安排宣傳車及派員於新入伙的住宅屋苑向住戶及物業管理人員派發「切勿聘用非法員工」的宣傳單張，呼籲切勿聘用非法勞工。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。另外，輸入勞工獲准以僱傭身分來港後，必須按『標準僱傭合約』所訂明直接受僱於合約中指定的同一僱主，並擔任合約中指定的職位及在指定的地點工作，而且不可受僱於其他公司或次承判商，亦不可轉換僱主、職位或工作地點（『標準僱傭合約』訂明的工作地點除外）。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

殷巧兒主席（中大聯合書院校董會主席）、王香生院長（中大聯合書院院長）、各位校董、副院長、各位教授、各位嘉賓、各位師兄師姐、各位同學：

大家早上好！很衷心感謝殷巧兒主席——殷師姐和王院長的邀請，讓我有機會再一次以聯合校友的身分回到中大。其實我不久以前也來過一次，就是做《中大校友》的訪問，當時除了走過百萬大道外，亦有機會回到書院，除了一些很熟悉的建築物外，亦看到新的發展，十分開心。剛才院長提到，為何那時候會有這麼多同學在，暑假是「細O camp」的日子，我看到很多正參與「細O camp」活動的同學，都很開心，當然也覺得自己老。我看到同學都是笑容滿面，對於大學生活都有種期盼，回想起自己30多年前，都是這種狀態。我們的工作既是服務香港社會、服務市民，更有種動力是要做得更好，讓一些準備進來（中大）或在座的同學，可以對其生活有更多期盼，對社會將來有更好的期盼。今日回到中大，與各位良師益友、學長學姊以及師弟師妹可以共聚一堂，為的當然是慶祝「聯合書院六十九周年院慶」。能夠參加這個意義非凡的盛會，我十分喜悅，亦非常榮幸。剛才大家介紹我的時候，除了是聯合的校友外，大家亦說是傑出校友，這個不敢當。但是可以見證的一點，就是聯合多年來培育了一代又一代願意為社會出力的學生、畢業生，我只是其中一個。

老套說，時光飛逝，歲月如歌，聯合書院自創立至今，已經走過接近七十年的光輝歲月，比起中大（創立）還要早數年。大家都聽到，中大今年62歲，聯合已經69歲。作為中文大學三所創校成員書院之一，聯合始終秉承以「明德新民」的院訓，以「務實創新，聯合邁進」的精神，致力推動全人教育，促進師生交流，凝聚學生對於中大及聯合書院的歸屬感，作育英才，為社會培育出一代又一代德才兼備的社會棟樑。我身為「聯合人」，時刻以在中文大學聯合書院求學成長為榮，這份歸屬感與自豪，到今日都始終伴我前行。

在眾多傑出的聯合人當中，很榮幸高錕教授是我們其中一位無比敬重的傑出教授。今日跟大家說說高教授。高教授在我就讀母校期間，是中大第三任校長，我的畢業證書校長的一欄是高教授的簽名。其實他在五十多年前，已經毅然放下在英國公司的事業，來到當時仍在香港島的聯合書院，創立了電子系，我們也許覺得，今日有電子系我們可能覺得是理所當然的，現在稱電子工程學系。但那時，沒有人知道甚麼是電子系，電子系在香港算是創先河。高錕教授見學系的研究風氣當時尚未濃厚，便引進外國大學的研究傳統，親自招攬一些留美歸國的學者和教授，亦積極為學生謀出路，引進外部評核，爭取英國工程師學會的認可，促成學生到企業實習，迅速奠定電子系的學術地位與聲譽。

我們更熟悉的是高教授被稱為「光纖之父」，他的非凡遠見徹底改寫了人類文明的進程，並因此榮獲「諾貝爾物理學獎」，貢獻永載史冊。今日，無論是AI（人工智能）、大數據，還是物聯網，無數前沿科技其實都建基於高速傳輸的光纖網絡。可以說沒有光纖，就沒有今日的數位世界。

最重要的是，高錕教授曾說：「我是屬於香港的。」為紀念這位偉大的科學家與教育家，香港最新，同時亦是首個以「藝術+科技」為核心的表演場地——東九文化中心，將會在十一月正式開幕，而開幕時將會隆重呈獻原創音樂劇《一束光 — 高錕的記憶》，這會是我們的開幕節目。這個劇不僅向高錕教授在科研領域的卓越貢獻致以崇高的敬意，更希望充分運用先進的科技設備，結合創意藝術，為觀眾帶來耳目一新的視聽體驗。在此，我要特別感謝母校的大力支持，在這劇的製作過程中提供很多協助，並慷慨借出高錕教授的珍貴物品及資料，讓這部作品可以完美呈現。

高教授追求真理的執著、實踐理想的毅力，他作為科學家與教育家的無私風範，以至他與妻子之間動人的鶼鰈情深，都值得我們每一個聯合人學習、傳承與發揚光大，我誠意邀請大家在十一月中的時候到東九文化中心入場觀賞這套音樂劇，一同走進我們這位傑出聯合人、亦是我們一位前校長的生命故事。

聯合書院的教育向來重視全人發展與多元視野的培養。大家可能都看過早前我在《中大校友》的訪問，當時曾提到聯合書院的通識教育讓我終身受益。聯合書院向來予人「貼地」、多元的感覺，或許我因此亦沾染了一點這種特質。書院當時的「月會」在邵逸夫堂進行，經常邀請不同領域的嘉賓，探討多元化的主題，我提過有外科手術、宇宙大爆炸理論、哲學探索、藝術思潮等，林林總總，橫跨不同領域，引導同學以多元角度思考，拓展認知邊界。這種兼容並蓄、同時亦緊貼生活的教學理念，正是中大，特別是我們聯合書院獨特的一種教育氣質。

剛才院長提及過的宿舍生活，在聯合書院的宿舍生活是我大學歲月裏非常難忘的一頁。我是在三、四年級時入住宿舍，在三年級時候伯宿（伯利衡宿舍），但是四年班的時候，因為新的恒生樓落成，所以我就很開心成為恒生樓第一批的宿生。與現時比較，當時是很開心能夠有恒生樓，就算是要行樓梯上落亦不介意，一定要申請恒生樓。當時經常與來自不同學系的同學食宵夜，有時在校內吃，有時外出到大埔吃，夜話，堅決不睡覺，談甚麼呢？我們那時候很認真，暢談學術，談一些哲學東西，真的激盪思考，你知道「政政」（政治與行政系）很喜歡辯論，一定是辯論至「你死我活」。剛才提到的「文化檢閱」，是我們當時讀理論的人用很多，被稱為Leo Marx的理論，一些很覺醒的理論。我們說很容易，如果在文化當中不覺醒，就會被文化異化，現在還懂得說幾句這些術語，但是坦白說當時我們沒有預料影響這樣深遠。我們舉辦活動，只是希望與大家分享一下文化現象。我們借用湯若望宿舍紅綠歌唱大賽模式主辦晚會，探討流行文化對每個人意識形態的影響。這些經歷當時豐富了我的思考維度，亦可扮得比較酷。想不到數十年後，時至今日仍對我在文化體育及旅遊局的工作帶來深遠啓發，仍記得當日思考的一些事情，現在都要重新思考一遍。

畢業後，我更加體會到，跨領域的知識與視野是在職場中必不可少的致勝之道。我鼓勵各位師弟師妹，在努力學習本科知識之餘，要積極利用這樣好的校園，積極參與跨學科活動，與不同學科的同學多交流合作，拓展不同的興趣與能力，為未來的人生舞台打下更堅實的基礎。

近年來，中大在各項世界大學排名中屢創佳績，這份榮譽屬於每一位中大人，當然包括我們聯合人，是我們代代相傳、堅持不懈、共同努力的豐碩成果。在此，我衷心祝願母校69周年生日快樂，人才輩出，再攀高峰！也祝福在座的師弟師妹勇敢追夢，前程錦繡，在座各位大家身體健康，家庭幸福。多謝各位。"

大家晚上好！非常高興出席今晚的盛會，與各位一同慶祝中華人民共和國成立七十六周年，並見證香港客屬總會第六屆會董會就職。

七十六年來，全國人民在國家帶領下團結奮鬥，取得輝煌成就。中國經濟實力、科技實力、綜合國力強大，國際影響力舉足輕重，與世界各國攜手推動構建人類命運共同體，展現大國擔當。我們每一位中華兒女都深感自豪。

在中華民族多元的大家庭中，客家是一支源遠流長的民系。經歷千百年遷徙，客家人已成為世界上分布最廣的民系之一，為推動中華文明傳承發展、促進世界文明交流互鑑，作出重要貢獻。

香港客屬總會自二○一一年成立以來，一直積極團結客籍鄉親，堅定支持特區政府施政，熱心參與社會事務，同時致力推廣客家傳統文化、培育青年。我肯定各位的貢獻。

客籍鄉親有很多都居於粵港澳三地，是大灣區建設的重要力量。作為國家最高規格綜合體育盛事的第十五屆全國運動會，首次由粵港澳三地共同承辦，還有不到一個月就正式揭幕。

今屆全運會在深圳、梅州、惠州、東莞、清遠在內的著名客家聚居城市，都設有賽區。在香港賽區，我們會在世界級場地啟德體育園，以及中環海濱、維園等地標舉辦賽事。全運會不但是一場體育競技，更是粵港澳大灣區融合發展的生動實踐、是大灣區市民共同展現團結與活力的舞台。我相信各位鄉親都熱切期待這一場「簡約、安全、精彩」的體育盛事。

客籍鄉親對社會的熱誠和擔當，是愛國愛港的重要力量、是推動國家和香港發展的強大因素。接著下來，我希望各位鄉親將力量，投入到對「愛國者治港」至關重要的事務——立法會換屆選舉。剛才，張國榮主席都提醒大家，重要的日子要踴躍投票。

在完善選舉制度後的立法會，過去四年全面落實「愛國者治港」原則，議政質量高、效率高，助力香港對接國家發展戰略，加強香港競爭力。我期待新一屆立法會，承接現屆立法會的良好勢態，進一步彰顯行政主導和「愛國者治港」原則相適應下的良政善治，為香港在創新改革中打開發展新局面。

各位，第八屆立法會選舉的提名期將於下星期五，亦即是十月二十四日展開。我鼓勵愛國愛港立場堅定、熱心服務社會、才德兼備的優秀人才積極參選。全香港市民、全香港社會，包括各位客籍鄉親，都應行使你們的公民權利和履行你們的公民責任，為自己、為香港的利益，在十二月七日投票日踴躍投票，並積極鼓勵你們身邊的家人、朋友、鄉親，都一同為香港這個共同家園投票。

最後，我祝願祖國富強昌盛，香港客屬總會新一屆會董會工作順利。多謝大家！"

雜貨店東主因僱用非法勞工被判入獄,2025-10-17 19:50,2025-10-17 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700702.htm,"   一名雜貨店東主因僱用不可合法受僱的人被定罪，於今日（十月十七日）在沙田裁判法院被判入獄兩個月。

   入境事務處（入境處）於二○二四年三月十三日連同勞工處進行「彩虹行動」，打擊非法勞工。行動中，入境處一般調查組人員在一間雜貨店內拘捕一名五十一歲從事店務工作的印尼籍女子。 該名女子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），及後在沙田裁判法院被判監禁十五個月。

   行動中，雜貨店東主亦因涉嫌聘用該名非法勞工而被拘捕。雜貨店東主為一名香港居民男子，年齡為五十七歲。他因並未採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱，被控僱用不可合法受僱的人的控罪。經審訊後，該名雜貨店東主今日在沙田裁判法院被判監禁兩個月。

入境處發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

   市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"
Grocery shop owner jailed for employing illegal worker,2025-10-17 19:50,2025-10-17 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700705.htm,"  A grocery shop owner was convicted of charge of being an employer of a person who was not lawfully employable and was sentenced to imprisonment for two months at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts today (October 17).

  During a joint operation against illegal workers conducted by the Immigration Department (ImmD) and the Labour Department codenamed ""Rainbow"" on March 13, 2024, officers of the ImmD General Investigation Section raided a grocery shop and arrested one female Indonesian illegal worker, aged 51, who was found working as a shop assistant. The female was a holder of a recognisance form, which prohibits her from taking employment. She was subsequently sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts.

  During the operation, the grocery shop owner was arrested for employing illegal worker. The grocery shop owner is a Hong Kong resident, male, aged 57. He is charged of being an employer of a person who was not lawfully employable as he did not take all practicable steps to ascertain whether the applicant was lawfully employable prior to employment. After trial, the grocery shop owner was jailed for two months by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts today.

  The spokesman of ImmD reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email toanti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form atwww.immd.gov.hk."
"FEHD welcomes PMSA's release of Best Practice Guides on ""Handling Water Seepage in Properties"" and ""Handling Dripping Air Conditioners""",2025-10-17 19:45,2025-10-17 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700697.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) welcomed the release of the Best Practice Guides on ""Handling Water Seepage in Properties"" and ""Handling Dripping Air Conditioners"" by the Property Management Services Authority (PMSA) yesterday (October 16). The FEHD believes that the Guides, outlining the relevant statutory responsibilities of and regulations to be observed by owners and residents of properties as well as the procedures for property management companies to follow when addressing water seepage and air conditioner dripping issues, will assist licensed property management companies and personnel in resolving water seepage and air conditioner dripping issues within properties.

The Government has been committed to addressing water seepage and air conditioner dripping issues. The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address proposed utilising technology to expedite the identification of seepage sources, requiring property owners to inspect and rectify the problem within a specified time, or else the Government will take further action and recover the costs from the owners. The Government will also actively promote mediation to resolve disputes between residents. In addition, the FEHD has adopted a new strategic approach this year, introducing new technologies to proactively tackle dripping air conditioners across various locations in Hong Kong, achieving notable results.

The FEHD expressed gratitude to the PMSA and the property management industry for their active support in jointly promoting improvements to the environmental hygiene of the community. The FEHD hopes that with the practical guidance provided in these two Guides, property management practitioners can assist in addressing water seepage and air conditioner dripping issues more effectively and enable timely intervention to resolve the issues at an early stage, thereby reducing complaints and disputes, enhancing communication among residents and promoting community harmony.

To encourage the property management industry to refer to the Guides for addressing water seepage and dripping issues within properties, the PMSA will hold a continuing professional development seminar on October 27, where representatives from the FEHD will brief property management practitioners on the details of the relevant investigation work and explain how they can effectively support the department's work.

The Guides on ""Handling Water Seepage in Properties""and ""Handling Dripping Air Conditioners""can be downloaded from the PMSA's website."

政府一直致力處理樓宇滲水和冷氣機滴水問題。《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出會利用科技加快確定滲水源頭，要求業主在指定時間內自行檢查和糾正，否則政府會採取進一步行動並向其收回費用，並積極推動以調解方式解決住戶之間的爭議。此外，食環署今年亦採取全新行動策略並引入新科技，積極主動地處理全港多個冷氣機滴水地點，取得一定成效。

食環署感謝監管局和物管業界積極支持，共同推動社區環境衞生的改善工作。署方期望該兩份指南能為物管從業員提供實務指引，讓他們更有效地協助處理樓宇滲水和冷氣機滴水事宜，按指引適時介入，以便及早妥善解決問題，從而減少投訴或糾紛，改善業戶的溝通，促進社區和諧。

為鼓勵物管業界參考指南處理物業滲水和滴水問題，監管局會於十月二十七日舉辦持續專業發展講座，屆時食環署代表會向物管從業員介紹署方進行相關調查工作的詳情，以及物管從業員可如何配合署方的工作。

Largest-ever Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 to celebrate decade of innovation with world-class line-up (with photos),2025-10-17 19:10,2025-10-17 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101600281.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) today (October 17) unveiled details of the 10th anniversaries of Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 (HKFW x SMUF), set to take place from November 3 to 7. This strategic alliance marks a decade of innovation while creating an expanded platform dedicated to all facets of technology and business impacts. The joint celebration underscores Hong Kong's commitment to the digital economy, leveraging its position as a leading international financial centre and thriving start-up hub.
  
  As Hong Kong's premier innovation-focused event, HKFW x SMUF is organised by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) and InvestHK, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and the Insurance Authority, and the appointed event organiser, Finoverse. The event is expected to attract over 37 000 attendees, more than 800 leading speakers and over 700 exhibitors from more than 100 economies. The main conference taking place on November 3 to 4 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre will enable the event to reach its largest scale ever.

This year's theme: Curating the New Fintech Era

  Consistently ranked among the world's top three international financial centres and as a leader in Asia, Hong Kong has taken bold strides to solidify its position as a leader in fintech as well. Hong Kong has recently been recognised by the Global Financial Centres Index as the world's No. 1 fintech hub, a testament to its pivotal role in advancing financial technology around the globe. With over 1 100 fintech firms operating in the city at present, and the sector projected to reach US$606 billion in total revenue by 2032, driven by an impressive annual growth rate of 28.5 per cent, HKFW will continue to expand its global influence, further cementing its position as Asia's leading fintech event.
  
  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""This year's theme of FinTech Week is 'Curating the New Fintech Era'. It is indeed our promise which is Hong Kong not only adapts to the future of fintech but will also shape the next chapter of global finance, where capital flows more intelligently and technology addresses real-world economic challenges. The Government will continue to work closely with the financial regulators and the fintech industry to build Hong Kong as an ideal destination for embracing and leading fintech, with a view to establishing scalable and sustainable fintech solutions that drive the global economy forward.""

A start-up superhighway

  Start-ups attending HKFW x SMUF will gain access to unparalleled resources on a unified platform. The event will foster a thriving community of entrepreneurs, investors, and industry leaders, with thought-provoking content on innovation, emerging technologies, and scaling strategies.
  
  Participants will include start-up founders, investors, and pioneers from sectors such as AI, fintech, green tech, health tech, proptech, and more. HKFW x SMUF will offer opportunities for ventures to secure funding, form partnerships, and break into Asia and global markets.
  
  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said, ""Start-ups are an important part of any economy. Behind every start-up, there must be an innovative business idea. These new ideas call for changes, and refresh our economy. And Hong Kong is just the right place not only for startups to be created, but also for them to grow to scale. Apart from the favourable business environment in Hong Kong, the start-ups here are supported by a strong network of incubators and accelerators, a pool of experienced angels and venture capitalists, a host of government-backed programmes and a welcoming business community."" He added that the number of start-ups in Hong Kong has increased from about 1 600 10 years ago to around 4 700 last year. The impressive expansion is a result of the pro-start-up measures taken by the Government over the years.

A new chapter of creating more together

  The main conference will feature 11 targeted forums with thoughtfully curated programmes. These include the Policy Forum, Visionary Forum, InsurTech Forum, HealthTech Forum, Wealth & Investment Management Forum, Digital Finance Forum, Digital Assets Forum, Blockchain & Web3 Forum, AI & Advanced Tech Forum, China-Global Innovation Forum, and TechX Forum.
  
  The Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, said, ""HKFW x SMUF are much more than conferences. They are strategic platforms driving tangible two-way investment flows and fostering meaningful collaborations. This year, we will welcome over 30 delegations from the Chinese Mainland and overseas, including leading Chinese Mainland tech hubs such as Beijing and Shenzhen, seeking 'go global' opportunities through Hong Kong; traditional markets in Western Europe and the United States, seeking to tap into Asia's growth; and emerging markets from the Gulf Cooperation Council region, ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and Central Europe. Their participation underscores the world's confidence in Hong Kong as the ideal place for innovative ideas to flourish and scale.""
  
  Ms Lau further emphasised that the 10th anniversary is not only a moment to reflect on past achievements, but also an opportunity to chart the future and invite the world to share ideas in Hong Kong's remarkable journey.
  
  This year, shortlisted Global Fast Track programme semi-finalist companies from seven verticals will be invited to the semi-finals and grand finale to pitch in person onstage during HKFW x SMUF. This provides an unparalleled opportunity for innovators to showcase their solutions in front of thousands of attendees, including key corporates, investors, service providers and communities seeking innovative fintech and other tech solutions and investment opportunities. The programme has already received overwhelming interest, with over 700 applications from 70 economies worldwide.

作為香港首屈一指的創科盛事，香港金融科技周 x StartmeupHK創業節2025由財經事務及庫務局、商務及經濟發展局和投資推廣署聯合主辦，並由香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會、保險業監管局和活動指定承辦商Finoverse合辦。本年活動預計將吸引來自超過100個經濟體，逾37 000與會者，超過800名演講嘉賓及700多家參展機構參與。主論壇將於十一月三日至四日在香港會議展覽中心舉行，規模將創歷屆之最。

今年主題：策動金融科技新時代

香港一直穩居全球三大國際金融中心之列，更是亞洲金融市場的領導者。近年，香港持續推動金融科技發展，最近獲《全球金融中心指數》評為全球第一的金融科技樞紐，足證本港在推動全球金融科技向前邁進的關鍵角色。現時，香港擁有逾1 100間金融科技企業，預計於二○三二年，金融科技行業的總收入將達至6,060億美元，年均增長率高達28.5%。香港金融科技周將持續拓展其國際影響力，進一步鞏固其作為亞洲領先金融科技盛會的地位。

財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇說：「香港金融科技周今年以『策動金融科技新時代』為主題，實際上這也是我們的承諾。我們的承諾不僅在於順應金融科技的未來，更致力於攜手開創全球金融新篇章——實現資本更智慧地流動，讓科技真正解決現實經濟的挑戰。政府會繼續與金融監管機構及金融科技業界緊密合作，致力打造香港成為擁抱和引領金融科技的理想地，建立具規模效益和可持續發展的金融科技方案，推動全球經濟向前邁進。」

劉凱旋強調，此次十周年誌慶不僅是回顧過去成就的重要時刻，更是展望未來、邀請全球共同分享香港非凡發展歷程的寶貴契機。

今年，來自七大領域的全球Fast Track計劃的入圍初創企業將獲邀參與於香港金融科技周 x StartmeupHK創業節2025舉行的準決賽及總決賽，進行現場路演。這為創新者提供一個無可比擬的機會，在數千名與會者面前展示其創新方案，當中包括大型企業、投資者、服務供應商及尋求金融科技及其他科技創新方案與投資機遇的業界社群。該計劃已吸引全球逾70個經濟體超過700份報名，反應熱烈。

Hong Kong Customs conducts interdepartmental anti-illicit cigarette publicity activities in Kwun Tong District (with photos),2025-10-17 19:07,2025-10-17 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700584.htm,"Hong Kong Customs conducted a joint anti-illicit cigarette publicity campaign with Legislative Council Member Mr Ngan Man-yu, members of the Kwun Tong District Council, the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health and the Housing Department at On Tai Estate in Kwun Tong today (October 17).

Before the start of the event, Customs officers conducted a brief for council members on the increase of the maximum penalty for engaging in illicit cigarettes activities from a $1 million fine and two-year imprisonment to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment. Moreover, a duty stamp system will be implemented to help distinguish between duty-paid and duty-not-paid cigarettes. The first phase of the system is planned to be implemented in the fourth quarter of 2026, followed by full implementation in the second quarter of 2027. Hong Kong Customs launched a three-month pilot run for the duty stamp system on October 6, which aims to evaluate its effectiveness and feasibility, as well as to promote industry and public awareness of the key features of the system that enable them to prepare for related compliance in advance.

Customs officers also patrolled the estate and set up a promotional booth to distribute promotional items to residents in order to promote anti-illicit cigarette messages and encourage them to report suspected illicit cigarette trading activities to Customs.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities. Also, Customs will strengthen publicity and education to remind the public not to take part in unlawful acts related to illicit cigarettes.

Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/).

In accordance with the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), no person shall distribute any smoking product advertisement (including any promotional leaflets). Any person who contravenes the regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000. Members of the public may report any suspected activities of illicit cigarette leaflets distribution to TACO's hotline 2961 8823."

海關人員於活動開始前向議員們進行簡介，包括未完稅煙草相關罪行的最高罰則已由罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年，提高至罰款二百萬元及監禁七年；香港將施行完稅標籤制度，以幫助區分已完稅和未完稅香煙，該制度的首階段計劃於二○二六年第四季實施，並於二○二七年第二季全面推行。此外，香港海關已於十月六日起開展為期三個月的完稅標籤制度先導計劃，旨在評估其效能及可行性，並讓業界及市民認識制度的重點內容，為配合該制度早作合規準備。

海關人員亦於屋邨範圍巡查及擺設攤位，向居民派發宣傳品，推廣反私煙信息並鼓勵他們向海關舉報懷疑買賣私煙活動。

海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。海關亦會加強宣傳教育，提醒市民切勿參與有關私煙的違法行為。

根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/）舉報懷疑私煙活動。

"Speech by USEE at partnership dialogue of Science and Innovation Forum of World Food Forum 2025 in Rome, Italy (English only)",2025-10-17 19:00,2025-10-17 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700607.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, at the partnership dialogue of the Science and Innovation Forum of the World Food Forum 2025 organised by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome, Italy, today (October 17):

  On the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)'s 80th anniversary, it is my honour to participate in the Partnership Dialogue today. This morning, we witnessed the signing of a Letter of Intent between the FAO and the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government to show mutual commitment to implement the One Health approach. This is indeed the best moment to take stock of the latest developments in the HKSAR.

  In the international arena, the FAO, the World Organisation for Animal Health, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations Environment Programme collaborate to drive the transformation required for mitigating the impact of health challenges at the human-animal-plant-environment interface at the global, regional and country level.

  On the HKSAR's part, while our agricultural land is limited, we have embraced various innovative solutions in support of the One Health approach, including in the agrifood systems.

  Back in September 2017, the HKSAR Government organised an International Conference on One Health in the HKSAR as one of the celebration activities for the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR.

  In December 2023, the HKSAR Government announced the Blueprint for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and Fisheries, which outlines the Government's vision and work targets to promote the upgrading and transformation of the local agricultural and fisheries industries. I will give two examples under the Blueprint, namely urban farming and a multi-storey pig farm.

  We seek to develop urban farming through a multipronged approach, with a view to integrating commercial agriculture into urbanised areas of the city to produce high-quality and fresh agricultural produce with reduced carbon footprints, and also providing green landscapes and modernised farming experiences to the communities.

  We have pioneered the adoption of high-efficiency hydroponic systems, which boost yield while simultaneously conserving water. These soil-free cultivation systems not only eliminate the need for chemical pesticides but also reduce the risk of plant disease transmission.

  We have recently launched the first pilot urban farm that utilises advanced farming technology in a public park, and will set up modernised hydroponic farms-cum-stalls on suitable rooftops of public markets. These help promote the concept of ""harvest-to-sale"", shortening the supply chains from farms to consumers.

We are also pioneering the development of multi-storey, modernised, and environmental-friendly livestock farming that exemplifies the integration of advanced technology with the One Health principles.

  This innovative vertical farming model harnesses cutting-edge automated systems and smart technologies to enhance biosecurity measures and significantly reduces environmental impact through enclosed, controlled environments. It not only curtails disease risks and reduces reliance on antibiotics but also maximises farming efficiency through precise resource management.

  Our multi-storey pig farm project is scheduled to commence operation around 2032.

  We now come to the prevention of zoonotic diseases. On diseases like avian influenza:


we have a robust, science-drivensurveillance and control programme, actively monitoring the viruses across the entire spectrum -from chicken farms and wholesale markets to pet bird shops, recreational parks and nature reserves;
we have enforced a compulsory vaccination programme on local farms for over two decades; and
with advancements in laboratory technology over the years, analysing local surveillance data and integrating findings from global health networks enable the updating of our designated vaccines in a timely manner to ensure vaccination efficacy.


  The absence of highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks on any local farm since 2008 demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.

  On antimicrobial resistance, we have been implementing a comprehensive Strategy and Action Plan through close collaboration on human health, animal health and environment fronts. Citing the work of the animal health sector for illustration purposes, the actions include:


systematic surveillance of antimicrobial usage and resistance in livestock;
the formulation of scienceâbased guidelines and farm-specific disease management plans to encourage prudent use of antimicrobials; and
practical support to farmers in strengthening hygiene, vaccination and biosecurity.


  These concerted efforts reflect our commitment to innovation, prevention and integration under the One Health principles. We seek to safeguard human health and animal health and advance a healthier, more resilient, and more sustainable future for all. We will continue to deepen our interdisciplinary collaboration, guided by the One Health principles. In this way, we hope to transform challenges into opportunities and deliver tangible and lasting impact. Thank you."

醫衞局副局長主持促進母乳餵哺委員會第十次會議（附圖）,2025-10-17 18:48,2025-10-17 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700617.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）副局長范婉雯醫生今日（十月十七日）主持促進母乳餵哺委員會（委員會）第十次會議，與委員會成員檢視及討論本地母乳餵哺情況、委員會轄下專責工作小組就加強產科醫院實行愛嬰措施的工作進展，以及今年年初成立的香港母乳庫的相關事宜，從而訂立促進母乳餵哺的策略方向。

會議上，衞生署代表向委員會匯報本地母乳餵哺的情況。本地的母乳餵哺率在過去25年有顯著改善。其中，二○二四年出院時的母乳餵哺率為81%，較二○○○年的55%大幅提升；純母乳餵哺至四個月大的比率則亦由二○○○年的8%上升至二○二四年的18%。以上數據顯示社區普遍支持母乳餵哺，以及政府多年來致力推廣母乳餵哺的措施成效。然而，衞生署留意到近年本地母乳餵哺率有下降趨勢，主要原因包括婦女對母乳餵哺的信心和動力不足，以及因為工作而放棄授乳，反映伴侶、家人、朋輩、工作間及社區的支持，以及締造便利母乳餵哺的友善環境和文化，對推動母乳餵哺至關重要。

新生兒出生後的最初幾小時和首數天是建立授乳和成功餵哺母乳的關鍵時刻，尤其母親與嬰兒於產房的即時肌膚相親十分重要。根據科學實證，此措施有助乳汁分泌，增加成功哺乳的機會。為加強及鞏固產科醫院（包括公立和私營醫院）的母乳餵哺友善措施，政府特意在委員會下成立專責工作小組，成員包括認證機構愛嬰醫院香港協會和本地產科醫院代表。工作小組主席在會議上報告了工作進展，包括在今年年中已加強現有產科醫院的監察系統，以期更精準地掌握嬰兒在出院前的母乳餵哺數據，以及在今年內為本地產科醫院就母乳餵哺友善措施的實施情況完成詳細的評估和分析，並根據這些資料，按情況提供策略性的建議，加強落實愛嬰措施。

另外，設於香港兒童醫院的香港母乳庫已於今年一月正式投入服務，為未能由親生母親餵哺的嬰幼兒提供母乳，減低早產及重病嬰兒患上重症的機會。母乳庫自今年三月起向全港九間設有新生兒深切治療部的公立醫院供應經處理的捐贈母乳。截至今年十月六日，母乳庫已有368名登記母乳捐贈者，並收集超過2 013公升母乳，供應予極早產及患有危疾的初生嬰兒，讓他們獲得最佳營養。同時，公立醫院的新生兒深切治療部已向309名有臨床需要的嬰兒派發經處理的捐贈母乳。

此外，委員會按本地情況，就推廣、維護及支持母乳餵哺提出了兩大策略方向：（一）強化及鞏固醫療機構的專業支援；及（二）加強各界對授乳母親的支持。

在醫療機構的專業支援方面，現時全港八間設有產科的公立醫院已全部獲認證為「愛嬰醫院」，有兩間提供分娩服務的私家醫院亦已啓動認證程序，當中一間已獲得認證。衞生署轄下正提供服務的29間母嬰健康院中亦有15間獲認證為「愛嬰母嬰健康院」，餘下的預計會在明年陸續獲得認證。政府會繼續透過上述專責工作小組推動本地產科醫院的母乳餵哺友善措施，並鼓勵更多私營醫院參與「愛嬰醫院」認證行動。

至於加強各界對授乳母親的支持方面，政府一向致力建立母乳餵哺友善環境，除已修訂《性別歧視條例》以禁止歧視和騷擾餵哺母乳的女性，並將法定產假由10星期延長至14星期外，自二○一九年初起，政府規定於新落成政府處所設置供公眾和員工使用的育嬰及哺乳設施。此外，政府亦已自二○一七年起，在新推售的商業用地（不包括酒店專屬用地）的賣地條件列出詳細的規定，包括在該等商業發展項目須設置的育嬰間及／或哺乳設施的面積和數目。政府亦鼓勵企業實施「母乳餵哺友善工作間」政策，以便在職母親返回工作崗位後繼續餵哺母乳。衞生署已為僱主和僱員推出相關指引，提供支持母乳餵哺的具體建議。

范婉雯醫生說：「母乳是嬰兒最理想的食物，不但安全衞生，亦含有抗體，有助預防許多常見的兒童疾病。維護母乳餵哺是全社會的共同責任。母親能夠持續餵哺母乳，實有賴於社會各界的協作與支持。我呼籲社會各界重視母乳餵哺，合力提供全方位的支持，創造友善的環境和氛圍。政府將繼續致力推廣及支持母乳餵哺，與社會各界攜手合作，提高母乳餵哺的持續性，促進整體的母嬰健康。」

委員會於二○一四年四月成立，成員來自相關的醫護專業人士、學術界和參與推廣母乳的組織代表。委員會負責就進一步加強推廣、維護及支持母乳餵哺有關策略及行動計劃提供意見，並監督相關進度，以提高母乳餵哺的持續性，並讓母乳餵哺成為社會大眾接受的主流育嬰模式。"
Under Secretary for Health chairs 10th meeting of Committee on Promotion of Breastfeeding (with photos),2025-10-17 18:48,2025-10-17 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700614.htm,"  The Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, chaired the 10th meeting of the Committee on Promotion of Breastfeeding today (October 17) to review and discuss with members of the Committee the local breastfeeding situation, work progress made by the dedicated working group under the Committee in enhancing baby-friendly measures in maternity hospitals, and matters related to the Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank (HKBMB) established early this year, with a view to formulating strategic directions for promoting breastfeeding.

  At the meeting, representatives of the Department of Health (DH) reported to the Committee the local breastfeeding situation. Breastfeeding rates in Hong Kong have shown significant improvement over the past 25 years. Among others, the breastfeeding rate on hospital discharge reached 81 per cent in 2024, marking a substantial increase when compared to the 55 per cent in 2000. The rate of exclusive breastfeeding until 4 months of age also rose from 8 per cent in 2000 to 18 per cent in 2024. The above figures indicate the wide community support for breastfeeding, as well as the effectiveness of the Government's measures in promoting breastfeeding over the years. Nevertheless, the DH has noted a downward trend in local breastfeeding rates in recent years. Key contributing factors include insufficient self-efficacy and motivation among women to breastfeed, as well as discontinuation of breastfeeding due to work commitments. This reflects that support from partners, family, peers, workplaces, and communities, as well as fostering a breastfeeding-friendly environment and culture, are critical to promoting breastfeeding.

  The first few hours and days after birth are critical for establishing lactation and success of breastfeeding, and the immediate skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby in the delivery suite is particularly important. According to scientific evidence, this helps breastmilk secretion and increases the chances of successful breastfeeding. To strengthen and consolidate the breastfeeding-friendly measures in maternity hospitals (including both public and private hospitals), the Government has specially set up a dedicated working group under the Committee, members of which include representatives from the accreditation body, namely the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative Hong Kong Association, and local maternity hospitals. The Chairman of the working group reported on the work progress at the meeting, including the enhancement of the monitoring system for existing maternity hospitals in the middle of this year to more accurately capture breastfeeding data prior to infant discharge, as well as a detailed assessment and analysis of the implementation of breastfeeding-friendly measures in local maternity hospitals to be completed within this year. Based on this information, strategic recommendations will be provided as appropriate to enhance the implementation of baby-friendly measures.

  In addition, the HKBMB located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital has officially commenced operations since this January to provide breastmilk for infants and young children who cannot be breastfed by their biological mothers, thereby minimising the chance of serious illness in premature or severely ill babies. Since this March, the HKBMB has supplied processed donated breastmilk to nine public hospitals in Hong Kong equipped with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). As of October 6 this year, the HKBMB had registered 368 breastmilk donors and collected over 2 013 litres of breastmilk to be supplied to extremely premature and critically ill newborns, providing the best possible nutrition. Meanwhile, public hospital NICUs have distributed processed donated breastmilk to 309 infants with clinical needs.

  Moreover, the Committee has proposed two main strategic directions on the promotion, protection and support for breastfeeding based on local circumstances, namely (1) strengthening and consolidating professional support from healthcare institutions, and (2) enhancing support for breastfeeding mothers from various sectors.

  Regarding professional support from healthcare institutions, at present, all eight public hospitals with obstetrics departments are accredited Baby-Friendly Hospitals (BFHs). Two private hospitals offering delivery services have activated the accreditation procedures, with one already accredited. Of the 29 Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) currently providing services under the DH, 15 of them have been accredited as Baby-Friendly MCHCs, with others expected to be accredited gradually starting from next year. The Government will continue to promote breastfeeding-friendly measures in local maternity hospitals and encourages more private hospitals to participate in the BFHs accreditation through the aforementioned dedicated working group.

  As regards to strengthening support for breastfeeding mothers from various sectors, the Government has long been committed to creating a breastfeeding-friendly environment. Apart from the amendments made to the Sex Discrimination Ordinance to prohibit discrimination against and harassment towards breastfeeding women, and the extension of statutory maternity leave from 10 to 14 weeks, the Government also mandated the provision of baby-care and breastfeeding facilities in newly built government premises for public and staff members' use since early 2019. Moreover, since 2017, the Government has included detailed requirements, including the area and number of baby-care rooms and/or lactation rooms that shall be provided in the commercial development projects, in the Conditions of Sale of new commercial land sale sites (excluding land designated for hotel use only). The Government also encourages more enterprises to implement a Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace policy to enable working mothers to continue breastfeeding after returning to work. The DH issued relevant guidelines for employers and employees with specific advice on supporting breastfeeding.

  Dr Fan said, ""Breast milk is the most ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean, and contains antibodies which can help prevent many common childhood illnesses. Protecting breastfeeding is a collective responsibility of the entire society. A mother being able to continue breastfeeding relies on collaboration and support from all sectors of the community. I call upon all sectors of the community to attach great importance to breastfeeding and work together to provide support on all fronts to foster a friendly environment and atmosphere. The Government will continue to promote and support breastfeeding with dedicated efforts, and collaborate with all sectors of the community to increase the sustainability of breastfeeding and enhance the overall maternal and child health.""

  Established in April 2014, the Committee comprises members from relevant healthcare professions and academia as well as representatives of organisations promoting breastfeeding. The Committee is responsible for providing recommendations on the strategies and action plans for further strengthening the promotion, protection and support for breastfeeding as well as overseeing the relevant progress, with a view to enhancing the sustainability of breastfeeding and advocating breastfeeding as the mainstream baby-care mode to be widely accepted by the general public."

OASES Deputy Director-General visits Beijing to strengthen ties and collaboration with strategic institutions (with photos),2025-10-17 18:45,2025-10-17 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700657.htm,"The Deputy Director-General of the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES), Dr Jimmy Chiang, visited Beijing from October 15 to 17 to meet with a range of strategic institutions, including a research institute, an innovation park, and foreign official trade and investment offices. The visit aimed to strengthen the close ties between Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and international partners, and foster collaboration in innovation and technology (I&T), as well as industrial development.

  ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" outlines the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's commitment to actively nurture emerging industries, including advanced manufacturing, life and health technology, new energy, artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. The HKSAR Government will step up its efforts to nurture emerging industries locally and attract those from outside Hong Kong, promoting the diversified development of the economy. Dr Chiang's visit reinforced these policy directions through a series of targeted engagements.

Dr Chiang first met with representatives of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences to exchange views on agricultural innovation, smart farming, and advanced manufacturing of agricultural equipment. He also introduced Hong Kong's unique advantages in research transformation, international connectivity, and market access. Both sides explored the feasibility of bringing agricultural research outcomes to Hong Kong and expressed interest in establishing a long-term collaboration, aligning with the Policy Address's emphasis on AI applications.

Dr Chiang then visited the Office of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Beijing and met with the Deputy Director, Miss Amy Yuen. They discussed ways to further support strategic enterprises operating in Hong Kong and Beijing, and to enhance regional co-ordination and policy alignment to facilitate strategic enterprise developments.

In the I&T sector, Dr Chiang visited Zhongguancun, a leading innovation hub in Beijing. He toured the Zhongguancun Exhibition Center to learn about the latest local technological achievements and the development of innovative enterprises. He also attended a roundtable at the Zhongguancun Beijing-Hong Kong-Macao Youth Innovation Center, where he engaged with young entrepreneurs and introduced Hong Kong's start-up support policies and funding schemes, encouraging high-potential tech ventures to establish a presence in Hong Kong.

Dr Chiang also met with representatives of the Swiss Business Hub China, under the Embassy of Switzerland in China, to explore opportunities for Swiss strategic enterprises to set up in Hong Kong. Both sides agreed to strengthen information exchanges and investment promotion collaborations, and to jointly explore development opportunities for Swiss strategic enterprises in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

Dr Chiang remarked that the visit was highly fruitful and further reinforced Hong Kong's position as a premier gateway for enterprises around the globe. He emphasised that OASES will continue to align with the policy direction in nurturing emerging industries, maintain close ties with strategic institutions, and attract high-potential enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong, driving long-term growth in I&T and high-value industries."
民政及青年事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-10-17 18:35,2025-10-17 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700649.htm,"​以下是民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（十月十七日）出席民青局粵港澳大灣區青年創業資助計劃「創業經理人 2.0 –向善計劃」啓動禮後會見傳媒的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長︰大家好，我很高興今天出席由保良局舉辦的「創業經理人2.0–向善計劃」啓動禮。為了助力青年能夠抓緊機遇，民青局及青年發展委員會（青發會）在二○一九年推出了粵港澳大灣區青年創業資助計劃（創業計劃），為青年創業團隊提供資金支持和創業支援服務。直到現在，我們已經成功培育超過200個青年創業團隊，其中有70多個團隊已經落戶深圳、廣州、珠海等大灣區內地城市。這充分體現了香港青年對創業的熱誠。去年，民青局和青發會亦再接再厲，推出新一輪的創業計劃，資助非政府機構再次推行青年創業項目。

保良局是第一輪創業計劃其中一個獲資助的機構，保良局亦再次參與新一輪的創業計劃，也再次獲得民青局資助，成為其中一個資助機構。在新一輪的創業計劃，他們共收到600多份申請。我們有十多個獲資助機構，其中單是保良局已經收到600多份申請。保良局甄選了17支青年創業團隊，他們會獲得由民青局、保良局和一個配對機構，就是騰訊公益慈善基金提供種子基金，用於在大灣區開展他們的創業項目。我們除了提供基金資助之外，這些機構也為創業團隊提供技術支援。正如我剛才在儀式上也提及，我們與廣東省港澳辦（廣東省人民政府港澳事務辦公室）和廣東省人社廳（廣東省人力資源和社會保障廳）一起成立了一個大灣區香港青年創新創業基地聯盟。我們希望透過聯盟的活動和介紹，可以讓香港的創業青年多點掌握在大灣區不同行業發展的趨勢和市場的走勢，令香港的青年創業家可以把握機遇，發展自己的事業。

另外，我也想談談關愛隊的服務。大家可能都知道，第一期關愛隊剛剛在上個月底、今個月初完成服務。而第二期關愛隊，獲選關愛隊和他們每一隊的關鍵績效指標、服務計劃等，我們今天都已上載至網頁供大家閱覽。全港18區將會有455支關愛隊，他們已經全面投入服務。

我們會循三個方向優化第二期關愛隊服務。首先，在第一和第二期的服務要做到無縫銜接，持續無間斷在社區內有關愛隊的服務。同時我們也按照地區的需要和人口，增加了三支關愛隊小隊，也對服務區域進行了合適的微調，以提升關愛隊服務的效率，令到關愛隊服務更符合區情區需。在服務內容方面，關愛隊會做得更深更廣，例如在一些老舊小區，關愛隊會加強樓宇管理的支援；而在新發展的小區，關愛隊就會重點支持一些新遷入的家庭。另外，第二期關愛隊的服務內容與第一期相比，整體更為優化，更顧及到小區居民的需要。

民政事務總署也會與相關政府部門緊密配合，為關愛隊成員提供培訓，涵蓋應急知識、溝通技巧、健康支援等實用技能，令關愛隊隊員和義工能更好地裝備自己，為市民提供關愛送暖的服務。

而在完善地區治理下，第七屆區議會一直與關愛隊合作無間，相互配合，一起在地區服務市民，產生良好的協同效果。總結第一期關愛隊的服務經驗，如果關愛隊能夠與當區區議員或區議會能夠更好結合，他們提供的服務質素是更能夠符合市民需要。所以為了進一步提升地區治理效能、便利和鼓勵區議會和關愛隊更加緊密合作，政府已按《區議會條例》委託區議員支持關愛隊的工作。區議員可以透過多元模式支持關愛隊，例如擔任關愛隊隊長或隊員的職務，或讓區議員辦事處成為關愛隊的夥伴團體，又或是在區議員辦事處設立關愛隊的服務點、聯絡點，讓區議員辦事處能夠協助處理關愛隊的行政工作，以及和關愛隊合辦活動等。我們期望進一步能夠加強區議會和關愛隊的合作，可以發揮協同效應，更好善用地區網絡，促進與小區居民之間的溝通，提升市民的幸福感和獲得感。

記者：現在不少區議員都已經和關愛隊合作，為甚麼仍要行使《區議會條例》委託區議員支持關愛隊工作？會不會導致出現雙重資助的問題？會不會向區議員提供額外資源？第二期關愛隊的KPI（關鍵績效指標）剛剛出爐，政府會在甚麼時間公開關愛隊的工作報告？市民如何能看到關愛隊的表現？

民政及青年事務局局長：首先，我們透過《區議會條例》委託區議員支持關愛隊的工作，是正式了兩邊的關係。我們在不斷優化和總結第一期關愛隊服務和經驗，發現如果關愛隊和當區區議會、區議員緊密合作，是可以發揮協同效應，為居民提供更好的服務。但礙於《區議會條例》，區議員辦事處或其聘請的職員等，只能用於執行區議會職務，所以有時會出現尷尬的情況，舉例說區議員辦事處希望為關愛隊提供落腳點、聯絡點，但礙於《條例》說明辦事處只能用於執行區議會職務的工作，所以如區議員助理收到市民電話想找關愛隊，他們會有疑問是否可以這樣做，這樣算是區議會工作的一部分？雖然現時實際情況，區議員已經提供很多便利，無論區議員或他們的助理也好，有街坊到辦事處想找當區的關愛隊，他們都會幫忙提供一些轉介或支援服務。如果我們能夠在區議員的工作內容方面寫得更清楚，便可減少這些尷尬情況，令區議員可以更好地幫助和支持關愛隊工作，社區裏「三駕馬車」之間的協同能夠更好配合，為市民服務。舉個例子，有些樓宇突然出現停水或停電事故，當區區議員和關愛隊一定會去支援，他們會怎樣合作？怎樣支援？如果現在這樣清楚說明，便能令區議員、區議員的助理和地區的工作隊伍不用再擔心，因為大家是一個團隊，一個大的地區治理團隊，一同為地區服務。

至於資助方面，關愛隊的資源就是純粹用於關愛隊支援和提供服務方面。舉例說，如果關愛隊借用了區議員辦事處作為聯絡點，他們的服務和資源只能用於提供關愛隊服務。但反過來，區議員是有實報實銷的津貼，如果他們需要聘請助理或辦事處交租，這些都屬實報實銷的津貼，我們一向強調需要嚴格遵守規則，區議員的津貼只能夠用於執行區議會的職務。所以以往因為這原因，他們的辦事處就不能容許關愛隊用作聯絡點，即是幫他們聽電話也是不行的。但現在我們容許有這個彈性，如果關愛隊借用區議員辦事處作為聯絡點，區議員的助理可以幫他們接電話，就不用如以往般接了電話之後，如是找關愛隊的便找關愛隊來聽，就不用有這個情況了。我們已經打通了這個關係，可以更好地為市民服務。

至於最後一個問題，第一期關愛隊的服務協議內已說明，他們完成了第一期服務後，需要提交工作報告給我們，最重要的是要提交一個經核數師核數的財務報告。現時第一期協議剛剛結束，當這些關愛隊按照服務協議，在期限前提交報告給我們後，我們會整理報告，希望可以向市民分享第一期關愛隊的服務成果。事實上，關愛隊第一期的服務，無論是探訪或為地區有需要的住戶提供應急服務等，都是達標的，甚至很多都是超標。但是怎樣可以將他們的工作成果、成績，更好地告知市民，讓市民更了解關愛隊的工作呢？當452隊第一期關愛隊按服務協議提交報告和核數報告後，我們會整理這些資料告知市民。

記者︰追問一下，以我的理解，區議員可以運用他們的資源在關愛隊上，關愛隊之後的支出會否計算區議員給他的資源在內，在他們的工作完結後？第二個問題是，關愛隊部分承辦團體已更換，換了多少隊？比例是怎樣？更換的原因是因為他們的工作表現可能差一點，還是因為他們自己的選擇？

民政及青年事務局局長︰先回答第二個問題，我們由本來第一期的452隊關愛隊，變成現時的455隊關愛隊，承辦團體的轉變大概是六隊，為甚麼是六隊呢？我們已有新的三隊，另外有三隊。大家都知道，關愛隊全都是義工，他們會按自己的工作或家庭各方面的需要去考慮參與關愛隊的服務。所以很多都是他們自己個人的考慮或他們組織的工作安排。

至於第一個問題，無論關愛隊也好，區議員也好，我們提供的津貼，尤其是區議員津貼，全部都是實報實銷，即是要有單據的。他們在計算時，假設為一個區提供服務後，既在區議員辦事處申報開支，又在關愛隊申報開支，這一定是不可以的。而關愛隊提供的服務，例如區議員要印工作報告，關愛隊的資源不會用於協助區議員印工作報告。如果關愛隊和區議員一起合作一個活動，區議員就可以利用他們實報實銷的開支宣傳這些活動。我們一定要確保關愛隊的資源是用在提供關愛隊的服務上。

至於你說會不會計算在內呢？如果一個關愛隊用了一個區議員辦事處作為聯絡點，他們是沒有繳付租金，所以這個就不會計算在他們的數目上，區議員借辦事處給他們作為聯絡點、讓他們接聽市民電話、幫街坊做些身體檢查和量血壓的服務，那些就不會用來計算他們得到的資源上。

那精神就是希望讓關愛隊和區議員的合作能更加無縫。最簡單的事情正如我剛才提及，就是有人致電要找關愛隊，但他們都表示不能幫忙接聽，因為我只做區議員的事情，以後便沒有這回事了，日後如有來電表示想找關愛隊，區議員助理或區議員都可以幫手聯絡關愛隊，或轉介給關愛隊，甚至他們可以和關愛隊一起提供服務，譬如說如果一棟樓宇突然出現停電、停水，他們一起設立服務站時，因為大家會一起設立服務點，現時就會計算清楚，究竟區議員的服務點是不是屬於他的，他設置一張服務枱，關愛隊是否要在旁邊設置另一張服務枱，然後大家分開，哪些是關愛隊的物資，哪些是區議員的物資，區議員的紙筆不是給關愛隊用的。日後就不用這樣了，以後可以很簡單和直接，關愛隊和區議員都可以一起設立一個服務點在地區提供服務。我們的概念是這樣，因為根據第一期的服務經驗，就是如果關愛隊和區議員有多一點合作，他們提供的服務會深一點、廣一點和快一點。如果我們能夠打破以往的做法，譬如我剛才所說，因為區議員很嚴格遵守財政紀律，他們一定只是會執行區議會職務的，如果不是區議會職務，他們是不會讓助理運用資源在非區議會職務上，這是很嚴格的，因為是實報實銷的開支，我們都不會讓他申報的。

現在我們將區議員支援關愛隊都納入他們的服務範圍內，就會讓他們打破這個界限，其實只是我們一個要求而已，因為打破這個界限後，他們便可以在地區內跟關愛隊更好合作，就如我剛才所說，不用有事的時候，分開區議員辦事處一張服務枱，關愛隊一張服務枱，以後便不用做這些不必要的工作。最終目的是希望讓「三駕馬車」、地區力量可以結合起來，有一個最快捷和最有彈性的方法為市民服務。"

"Mini-drama ""Victory in War of Resistance"" recreates historical scenes to pay tribute to war heroes (with photos)",2025-10-17 18:15,2025-10-17 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101600558.htm,"  This year marks the 80th anniversary of the Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. The Information Services Department (ISD), in collaboration with Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), has produced a mini-drama titled ""Victory in War of Resistance"" (Chinese only). This five-episode series aims to enhance public awareness of the War of Resistance on the Chinese Mainland and in Hong Kong, remember history, honour martyrs, and cherish and safeguard peace to cultivate patriotic feelings and foster a strong sense of national identity and belonging. The programme is available starting today (October 17) on the 80th Anniversary of Victory in War of Resistance dedicated webpage, as well as the official websites and social media platforms of the ISD and RTHK.

  The mini-drama consists of five episodes and tells the story of a group of young guerrillas defending their homeland during the fall of Hong Kong. The protagonist initially plans to flee the city with his family, but later joins guerrilla forces alongside his cousin to fight bravely against the enemy. During a mission to attack Kai Tak Airport, a site occupied by the Japanese army, his cousin sacrifices himself by staying behind to detonate explosives, destroying Japanese military equipment and fulfilling a noble cause.

The mini-drama features a cast of young actors, including Angus Yeung, Venus Lam and Tomi Ng. To enhance authenticity, the production team referenced a wealth of historical photographs during the filming of the mini-drama. They utilised computer-generated effects and AI technology to colourise black-and-white historical photos, integrating them into the drama. This immersive approach allows audience to vividly experience the hardships of the wartime era. The scene depicting the guerrilla raid on Kai Tak Airport was meticulously recreated with high historical accuracy.

To further deepen public understanding of the War of Resistance, each episode concludes with a ""History Insight"" segment. Presented in an engaging format, this segment introduces historical facts to help audiences build accurate historical knowledge and perspectives, and to deepen their appreciation and respect for this chapter of history.

All five episodes of the mini-drama will be available on the following platforms:

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-17 17:30,2025-10-17 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700559.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 17), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 39 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââââ
  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

十月份第三批涵蓋九個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及兩個監察地區分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共三批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共23個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這23個監察區中，15個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有八區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

按揭證券公司發行第三批基建貸款抵押證券,2025-10-17 17:00,2025-10-17 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700487.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港按揭證券有限公司（按揭證券公司）今日（十月十七日）宣布成功發行第三批基建貸款抵押證券。這次發行是通過特設公司Bauhinia ILBS 3 Limited（Bauhinia 3）進行。按揭證券公司於二○二三年和二○二四年成功發行基建貸款抵押證券後，繼續致力透過定期發行以發展這一資產類別。Bauhinia系列證券的發行為專業投資者提供一個投資橫跨不同地域和行業的多元化項目和基建貸款機會。

按揭證券公司執行董事兼總裁鮑克運表示：「再次成功發行彰顯了按揭證券公司對基建貸款抵押證券的持續投入，以及對香港發展為基建融資中心的支持。新增和現有投資者持續的強勁需求，顯示他們對此資產類別的興趣日漸增加，並對其帶來的好處和多樣化更加認可。」

Bauhinia 3的發行再次獲得投資者的踴躍反應，包括新增和現有投資者，而亞洲以外的投資者需求增加。擴大後的投資者基礎非常多元化，涵蓋資產管理公司、企業、家族辦公室、金融機構、保險公司、私人銀行及證券公司。

亞洲基礎設施投資銀行（亞投行）繼續透過對按揭證券公司基建貸款抵押證券總計三億美元的投資計劃，成為錨定投資者，參與基建貸款抵押證券的發行。亞投行的投資計劃繼續實踐其將私有資本引入基建行業的目標。

Bauhinia 3組合涉及12個國家的33個項目和基建債務、28個獨立項目和9個子行業，總值約4.505億美元。所發行的票據共分五級（A1-SU級、A1級、B級、 C級和D級），總值4.279億美元，並於香港聯合交易所上市。基於資產組合的質量，以及投資者對基建貸款抵押證券興趣的增加，按揭證券公司首次在亞洲發行非投資級的D級票據，進一步提高了資本結構效率。按揭證券公司為是次交易的發起人、抵押品管理人和風險保有人。

Bauhinia 3的資本結構中，有1.17億美元是由具可持續發展、綠色和社會責任元素資產組成的可持續融資票據（A1-SU級）。A1-SU級票據在按揭證券公司的《社會責任、綠色及可持續金融框架》下發行，符合國際資本市場協會的綠色債券原則、社會責任債券原則和可持續債券指引。

HKMC's third infrastructure loan-backed securities issuance,2025-10-17 17:00,2025-10-17 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700485.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

âThe Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited (HKMC) announced today (October 17) the successful completion of its third infrastructure loan-backed securities (ILBS) issuance. This is executed through a Hong Kong special purpose vehicle (SPV), Bauhinia ILBS 3 Limited (Bauhinia 3) and it builds on the HKMC's aim of developing the ILBS asset class through regular issuances after successful issuances in 2024 and 2023. The Bauhinia issuances offer professional investors exposure to a diversified portfolio of project and infrastructure debt across multiple geographies and sectors.

  The Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of the HKMC, Mr Colin Pou,said, ""It is another successful issuance demonstrating the HKMC's continued commitment to ILBS and the support for the development of Hong Kong as an infrastructure financing hub. The ongoing strong demand from new and existing investors shows that investor interest continues to grow and they increasingly recognise the benefits and diversification this asset class brings.""

The Bauhinia 3 issuance received another strong response from investors, both from new and repeated investors, with growing demand from investors outside Asia. The expanded investor base is well diversified, including asset manager, corporate, family office, financial institution, insurer, private banking, and security firm investors.

Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) continued to support the HKMC's ILBS issuance as an anchor investor through its US$300 million investment programme. AIIB's investment programme continues to fulfil its objective to mobilise private capital into the infrastructure sector.

Bauhinia 3 has a portfolio of 33 project and infrastructure loans across 28 individual projects spreading across 12 countries and 9 sub-sectors, with a total value of approximately US$450.5 million. In total, five classes of notes are issued (Class A1-SU, Class A1, Class B, Class C and Class D), with aggregate principal of US$427.9 million. The issued notes are listed on The Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The quality of the portfolio and increasing investor interest in ILBS allowed the HKMC to issue Class D at non-investment grade, the first of its kind in Asia, which further enhanced the efficiency of the capital structure. The HKMC acts as the sponsor, collateral manager and risk retention holder of the transaction.

Within the capital structure of Bauhinia 3, there is an US$117 million sustainability tranche (Class A1-SU) backed by sustainable, green and social assets. Class A1-SU is issued in accordance with the HKMC's Social, Green and Sustainability Financing Framework, which aligns with the Green Bond Principles, Social Bond Principles and Sustainability Bond Guidelines released by the International Capital Market Association.

Standard Chartered Bank is the Sole Global Co-ordinator. BNP Paribas, China International Capital Corporation Hong Kong Securities Limited, ING Bank N.V., Singapore Branch, MUFG Securities Asia Limited and Standard Chartered Bank are the Joint Bookrunners. Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited is the Co-Manager."

Among the third batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas in October, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released three batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 23 survey areas. Among these 23 survey areas, 15 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Eight other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#).

​23名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-10-17 16:45,2025-10-17 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700541.htm,"23名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於十月十日及今日（十月十七日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款介乎800元至8,800元，合計罰款共72,600元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 262宗個案，而就法庭已處理的913宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及793名分間單位業主，合計總罰款共2,436,710元，另有349宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該23名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；及（二）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

Deputy Commissioner Li (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Li Yongsheng), Consuls-General, Chamber representatives, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. A very warm welcome to the Hong Kong Museum of History.

  Thank you for joining this special tour of the ""United in Arms, Standing for Peace"" exhibition.

  Today, you are not just attending an exhibition. You are looking at a pivotal chapter in the history of China and the world.

  The war began in 1931. For 14 long years, the Chinese nation fought with great courage and a strong will to protect the homeland. The cost was immense. Millions of lives were lost.

  The exhibition shows this history through more than 180 exhibits. Eighty-two of them are from the National Museum of China. About 60 items are being shown for the first time. Eight of these are top-level national treasures.

  Each item tells a story of struggle and sacrifice. They also show Hong Kong’s role in supporting the national effort.

  The exhibition is about education and remembrance. We must never forget the sacrifices made. We remember the past not to keep hatred alive, but to cherish the peace we have today. We remember to learn from history and to build a better, brighter future for all.

  The exhibition, which runs until mid-December, is a team effort. It is jointly organised by our Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Hong Kong Museum of History, and the National Museum of China. We also thank the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust and the Bank of China (Hong Kong) for their generous support.

  The exhibition is just one part of our effort. We are also organising a variety of related events and activities, including visits to war sites, seminars, thematic lectures, film screenings, book fairs and photo exhibitions across Hong Kong. The goal is to help the public understand the spirit of unity and resilience of the Chinese people in the fight for peace.

  As announced in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, we are repairing war sites in every district with a view to integrating them into tourism routes and educational activities.

  We will also collaborate with Shenzhen to promote a new red educational route, under the theme of ""Chinese Cultural Celebrity Rescue"" history, to enhance understanding among people of Hong Kong and tourists of the history of the War of Resistance in Hong Kong.

  Ladies and gentlemen, this exhibition shows the great horrors of war. But it is presented in the name of peace.

  Thank you."
23 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-10-17 16:45,2025-10-17 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700542.htm,"  Twenty-three landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $800 and $8,800, amounting to a total of $72,600, on October 10 and today (October 17) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 262 cases to date. Among the 913 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 793 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,436,710. In addition, 349 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 23 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon a comprehensive investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to enable SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."

Deputy Commissioner Li (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Li Yongsheng), Consuls-General, Chamber representatives, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. A very warm welcome to the Hong Kong Museum of History.

  Thank you for joining this special tour of the ""United in Arms, Standing for Peace"" exhibition.

  Today, you are not just attending an exhibition. You are looking at a pivotal chapter in the history of China and the world.

  The war began in 1931. For 14 long years, the Chinese nation fought with great courage and a strong will to protect the homeland. The cost was immense. Millions of lives were lost.

  The exhibition shows this history through more than 180 exhibits. Eighty-two of them are from the National Museum of China. About 60 items are being shown for the first time. Eight of these are top-level national treasures.

  Each item tells a story of struggle and sacrifice. They also show Hong Kong’s role in supporting the national effort.

  The exhibition is about education and remembrance. We must never forget the sacrifices made. We remember the past not to keep hatred alive, but to cherish the peace we have today. We remember to learn from history and to build a better, brighter future for all.

  The exhibition, which runs until mid-December, is a team effort. It is jointly organised by our Leisure and Cultural Services Department, the Hong Kong Museum of History, and the National Museum of China. We also thank the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust and the Bank of China (Hong Kong) for their generous support.

  The exhibition is just one part of our effort. We are also organising a variety of related events and activities, including visits to war sites, seminars, thematic lectures, film screenings, book fairs and photo exhibitions across Hong Kong. The goal is to help the public understand the spirit of unity and resilience of the Chinese people in the fight for peace.

  As announced in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, we are repairing war sites in every district with a view to integrating them into tourism routes and educational activities.

  We will also collaborate with Shenzhen to promote a new red educational route, under the theme of ""Chinese Cultural Celebrity Rescue"" history, to enhance understanding among people of Hong Kong and tourists of the history of the War of Resistance in Hong Kong.

  Ladies and gentlemen, this exhibition shows the great horrors of war. But it is presented in the name of peace.

  Thank you."
衞生防護中心公布新增兩宗類鼻疽個案,2025-10-17 16:30,2025-10-17 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700521.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月十七日）表示，過去一星期（十月十日至十六日）錄得兩宗新增類鼻疽個案。中心呼籲市民保持個人及環境衞生以預防類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

首宗個案涉及一名過往健康良好的44歲男子，他居於元朗區。他於九月十九日弄傷右膝，九月二十六日起出現發燒、右膝傷口疼痛及傷口位置出現分泌物，十月六日到天水圍醫院急症室求診，無需入院。他的臨床診斷為傷口感染。

第二宗個案涉及一名有長期病患的66歲男子，他居於葵青區。他自十月十日出現發燒、全身乏力及昏厥，翌日（十月十一日）到伊利沙伯醫院急症室求診，需留院治理。他的臨床診斷為敗血症。

兩名患者目前況穩定，他們的臨床樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。中心正調查個案的感染源頭，初步流行病學調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這兩宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至昨日（十月十六日），本港今年錄得18宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"

此外，香港海關龍獅團於歡迎酒會獻上精彩演出，而英華小學高級合唱團亦在會議開始前表演，為會議增添活力，並充分展現海關人員及香港年輕一代的才華、創造力與發展潛能。"
CHP announces two new melioidosis cases,2025-10-17 16:30,2025-10-17 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700522.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 17) announced that two new melioidosis cases were recorded in the past week (October 10 to 16). The CHP appealed to members of the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent melioidosis. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

The first case involves a 44-year-old male with good past health who lives in Yuen Long. He sustained an injury to his right knee on September 19. He has presented with a fever, and pain and discharge from the wound on his right knee since September 26. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Tin Shui Wai Hospital for treatment on October 6. The clinical diagnosis was a wound infection. He did not require hospitalisation.

The second case involves a 66-year-old male with underlying illness who lives in Kwai Tsing. He presented with a fever, malaise and syncope since October 10. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital on the next day (October 11) and was admitted for treatment. The clinical diagnosis was sepsis.

Both patients are in stable condition. Their clinical samples were confirmed to be positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei upon testing. The CHP is investigating the infection sources of the cases. Initial epidemiological investigations revealed that these two cases are sporadic. No epidemiological linkages have been established between them and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of yesterday (October 16), 18 melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.


âThe CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. For more information on melioidosis, please visit the website of the CHP atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html."

The meeting gathered more than 70 representatives from A/P Customs administrations and the WCO's regional entities. The agenda featured a series of thematic presentations and discussions that facilitated participants in exchanging views on Customs initiatives, enforcement strategies and training experiences from diverse perspectives, deepening co-operation and connections among A/P members.

The meeting commenced on October 14 with a welcoming speech delivered by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat, in the capacity of the WCO Vice-Chairperson for the A/P Region (APVC). Mr Chan emphasised that the meeting provided a vital platform for A/P members and regional entities to discuss and formulate policies for the global Customs community. He encouraged members to take the opportunity to share their experiences and innovative ideas and explore future Customs developments. He also highlighted Hong Kong Customs' proactive efforts during its first year as the APVC and the impactful events organised that have brought together representatives and experts worldwide to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration across the region.

In his concluding remarks today, Mr Chan highlighted the fruitful outcomes of the four-day meeting, including discussions on current and future regional development strategies and exchanges of experiences in domestic Customs policies. The participants took part in in-depth discussions on an innovative initiative led by Hong Kong Customs in the capacity of the APVC, which was about a blockchain-based validation platform for digital documents designed to accelerate regional logistics and economic development. At the same time, Mr Chan expressed gratitude for all delegates' active participation, stressing that all the insightful proposals and collective commitment to advancing regional development contributed to the meeting's success.

The welcoming reception featured a wonderful performance by the Hong Kong Customs & Excise Dragon and Lion Dance Association.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666.

Speech by SCED at Hong Kong Fintech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 (English only),2025-10-17 15:35,2025-10-17 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700507.htm," Following is the speech by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, at the press conference on Hong Kong Fintech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 today (October 17):

 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today.

 The StartmeupHK is an initiative which aims at helping founders of innovative and scalable start-ups from outside Hong Kong to set up or expand here. Through this initiative, Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) offers information about our start-up ecosystem, connects people to the start-up community, and fosters a positive environment for start-ups to thrive.

 Start-ups are an important part of any economy. Behind every start-up, there must be an innovative business idea. These new ideas call for changes and refresh our economy. And Hong Kong is just the right place not only for start-ups to be created, but also for them to grow and scale. Apart from the favourable business environment in Hong Kong, the start-ups here are supported by a strong network of incubators and accelerators, a pool of experienced angels and venture capitalists, a host of government-backed programmes and a welcoming business community.

 Attracting and grooming start-ups are an important aspect of InvestHK's work. And it has done a great job. The number of start-ups in Hong Kong has nearly tripled, from about 1 600 start-ups 10 years ago to around 4 700 last year. The impressive expansion is a result of the pro-startup measures taken by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government over the years.

 While it is common for start-ups to be set up by local people, it is worth noting that 28 per cent of the founders of our start-ups are from outside Hong Kong. This is obviously a testament to Hong Kong's appeal as Asia Pacific's top destination for start-up investment and a start-up talent magnet. Going forward, we will continue to focus on assisting high potential unicorns and scale-ups worldwide across various sectors to grow.

 This year, the StartmeupHK initiative has evolved by collaborating with Hong Kong FinTech Week, under the theme ""Curating the New Fintech Era"". Building on the success in the past, the 2025 edition highlights the growing convergence of fintech with other frontier technologies - artificial intelligence (AI), greentech, healthtech, and Web3 - which are increasingly deployed as part of comprehensive tech start-up solutions. The Festival offers a unique opportunity to engage with the fintech ecosystem and reinforces Hong Kong's position as a hub for scalable start-ups and cross-border innovation.

 To bring this theme to life, we will expand the main conference from eight to 11 fora, introducing new sessions like ""Healthtech & Insurtech"" and the ""ChinaâGlobal Innovation Forum"". We will also cover wider cross-sector themes such as ""Blockchain & Web3"" and ""Digital Finance"". These fora will address important global issues including asset tokenisation, responsible AI, and the growing convergence of healthtech and insurtech. Besides, there will be a new ""TechX Forum"" to explore how emerging technologies are moving from experimentation to large-scale deployment. These additions encourage earlier practical conversations between founders, regulators, and corporates, helping start-ups move faster from pilot projects to full production.

 InvestHK's Global Fast Track 2025 programme has also grown to include seven verticals, adding ""Innovation & Technology"" to expand beyond fintech. This reflects the increasing overlap of technology across multiple industries. The year-long hybrid programme provides participants with one-on-one meetings, live pitching opportunities, mentorship, and tailored business matching with corporate clients, investors and service providers. I strongly recommend that the global start-up community joins this programme to assist your start-ups in scaling up by leveraging Hong Kong's advantages.

 Looking ahead, with the StartmeupHK Festival at the heart of this partnership, we are not just celebrating success - together, we are shaping Hong Kong's future of innovation.

 We look forward to welcoming the global start-up community to join us this November. Please come to Hong Kong to connect, to build and to scale. I am sure that you will always find unlimited business opportunities in our city, your ideal destination for business and investment.

 Thank you."

Ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. It is with immense pleasure that I unveil the details of this year's highly anticipated Hong Kong FinTech Week 2025.

 This year marks a historic milestone - the 10th anniversary of the event. I have been privileged to witness the tremendous growth and evolution of this event in the past years. This remarkable year is graced with new records. We are welcoming over 37 000 executives, more than 800 renowned speakers, and 700 exhibitors from over 100 economies to celebrate with us.

 This powerhouse event, together with the StartmeupHK Festival, will demonstrate how Hong Kong is leveraging technological convergence to elevate the economic impact of fintech and innovation on a global scale.

 Hong Kong's credentials as a fintech leader are not just claims - they are hard, global facts. Consistently ranked among the world's top three international financial centres and as a leader in Asia, Hong Kong has taken bold strides to solidify its position as a leader in fintech as well.

 Today, Hong Kong's fintech hub is ranked number one globally under the latest Global Financial Centers Index. Our city is home to more than 1 100 fintech firms, and the fintech sector is projected to reach US$606 billion in total revenue by 2032, with an impressive annual growth rate of 28.5 per cent.

 In the first half of this year, Hong Kong was also ranked first globally in terms of the amount of funds raised through IPOs (initial public offerings), with many advanced technology companies listing on our exchange.

 FinTech Week this year carries the theme ""Curating the New Fintech Era"". It is indeed our promise: Hong Kong will not just adapt to the future of fintech. We will lead, we will build and continue to stay at the forefront of it.

 None of this success happens by accident. It comes from sustained policy vision, unwavering public-private collaboration, and a commitment to balancing innovation with security. Let me highlight the milestones we have achieved over the past year.

 On digital assets, our Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong issued in June this year sets out our vision for a trusted and innovative ecosystem that prioritises risk management and investor protection. We also implemented the Stablecoins Ordinance in August to establish a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers, on top of our existing regulatory framework for virtual asset trading platforms that commenced in June two years ago.

 On AI (artificial intelligence), we issued a policy statement on responsible adoption of AI in the financial market last October, and have launched two cohorts of GenA.I. Sandbox to assist banks in exploring generative AI's capabilities in enhancing risk management, anti-fraud measures and customer experience.

 On e-payment, we launched Payment Connect with the People's Bank of China in June this year to implement the linkage of the Internet Banking Payment System on the Mainland and the Faster Payment System, with a view to supporting secure, efficient and also convenient real-time cross-boundary payments.

 We also continue to enhance the financial infrastructure, such as the Commercial Data Interchange, and the Central Bank Digital Currency, to explore integrating fintech with the real economy.

 Each of these initiatives reflects the collaboration among the Government, financial regulators and industry players. We turn ideas into action, and at the same time action into global leadership.

 Looking ahead, we are doubling down on this momentum with a clear, forward-focused strategy. As highlighted in the latest Policy Address, we will leverage the ongoing asset reallocation wave by global investors to consolidate our status as an international financial centre. We will drive fintech development and promote green and sustainable finance to capitalise on these new growth opportunities. This is not just about maintaining our lead; it is about shaping the next chapter of global finance, where capital flows more intelligently and technology addresses real-world economic challenges.

 This year Hong Kong FinTech Week will serve this purpose. It will bring together global finance and tech leaders, policymakers, and investors to collaborate, and curate the new fintech era.

 So I invite each of you, every one of you here today to join us. Let's explore the boundless possibilities of fintech. Let us pave the way for a connected, efficient, and sustainable global economy. Thank you."

  Brownfield operators, which were invited to participate in previous relevant tenders for a short-term tenancy two or more times after the completion of clearance exercises of relevant government development projects, will be excluded from this tender.

  The tender commences today and will close on November 19. Details of the four sites and the list of relevant government development projects involved are described in a Government Noticegazetted today.

  Under the prevailing arrangements, business operators affected by government development projects will be offered statutory compensation in accordance with the law, or ex-gratia allowances as an alternative, subject to the fulfilment of relevant eligibility criteria.

  A spokesperson for the LandsD said that in order to facilitate brownfield operators' relocation of businesses or operations, and to optimise the utilisation of land resources, the department has been identifying suitable vacant sites on government land to let through tender by way of a short-term tenancy.

  The four sites to be let through tender are suitable for a range of uses including industrial use, open storage, godown, workshop, recovery and recycling or reprocessing business and fee-paying public carpark.

  The spokesperson stressed that the LandsD will continue to identify vacant sites suitable for use by those brownfield operators required to be displaced, and these sites will be let through tender by way of a short-term tenancy."

海關人員九月十日於香港國際機場入境大堂截查一名四十三歲男旅客，經檢查後發現他將該批藥物針劑、藥劑產品及藥膏收藏於寄艙行李箱和個人行李中。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，切勿攜帶受管制物品進出香港。

根據《進出口條例》，任何人在沒有有效進口許可證下進口藥劑產品及藥物，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

The total estimated market value was about $950,000. The passenger concerned was convicted and sentenced to four months' imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (October 17) for contravening the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) (Cap. 60). All the pharmaceutical products were confiscated.

Customs officers intercepted a 43-year-old male passenger on September 10 at the Arrival Hall at HKIA for Customs clearance. Upon examination, the batch of pharmaceutical injections, pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical ointment was found inside his check-in suitcases and personal baggage.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence imposes a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds the public not to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong.

Under the IEO, any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

​運輸及物流局局長在立法會交通事務委員會就「粵車南下」開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-17 12:00,2025-10-17 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700310.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十月十七日）在立法會交通事務委員會就「粵車南下」的開場發言全文：

主席：

特區政府和廣東省政府一直致力推動各項跨境通行政策，尤其我們希望用好港珠澳大橋，促進粵港澳大灣區的互聯互通。「粵車南下」作為「港車北上」的互惠安排，更便利粵港兩地居民雙向奔赴，由人文交流所帶來的協同效應，能為粵港兩地經濟、社會發展、旅遊發展，以至大灣區融合發展注入更大動能，進一步強化香港內聯外通，也是加強粵港合作的重要體現。

粵港雙方已於今年七月公布「粵車南下」政策，二○二五年《施政報告》附篇亦已述明，粵港正全力推進，讓符合條件的粵車可以一方面經大橋前往香港口岸人工島上的自動化停車場泊車後，司機和乘客經香港國際機場轉乘飛機，或入境轉乘香港四通八達的公共交通工具；或第二方面，在無須取得常規配額下以自駕方式經大橋直接入境並暢遊香港各市區部分。

我們將透過四大策略，包括確保安全、有效分流、設有完備配套和能提出簡便申請，穩步推行「粵車南下」。近月，我們在準備工作上也取得積極進展，今日亦想趁此機會在委員會向大家匯報和聽取意見。首先，在確保安全方面，我們將透過多渠道向內地申請人發放「懶人包」以及不同主題的簡短影片，以深入淺出的方式介紹香港道路和駕駛安全資料。而入境市區的粵車更須按香港的要求進行驗車，為此，運輸署正委託香港機構在廣東方便的地點設立驗車中心，安排車輛檢驗。

第二，在有效分流方面，口岸停車場會先啓用轉機停車場，提供約1 800個泊車位，設24小時自動化停車及送機和接機服務。今日有香港機場管理局的同事在埸，稍後可就這方面的籌備工作回應議員的提問。入境市區部分則會採取穩健可控方針，以小規模每日100個預約名額開始，預備每輛粵車留港最多三日。我們會視乎推行情況、用家和市民適應程度，以及配套設施的使用狀況等，日後與粵方持續檢視和商討有序增加每日出行名額。我們亦會透過不同渠道發放「粵車南下」的旅遊泊車指南，引導旅客至全港各區的文化、體育、旅遊、展覧與購物消閒的地方，介紹附近具備泊車位的地點。我們亦鼓勵旅客來港後，可泊車轉乘四通八達、極具香港特色且近日廣受旅客歡迎的公共交通工具，穿梭香港的街道到不同地點，以至在維港兩岸景色環繞下遊走港九兩岸，同時亦可體驗我們的服務效率與歷史韻味並重的公共交通所編織出的公交風景線，從而盡量疏導並分流，避免粵車過分聚集於個別地點。指南內的建議行程會按經驗和景點的轉變而陸續增加，包括文化、旅遊、展覽的景點，或如何透過停車場或酒店設施附近能在泊車後轉乘其他公共交通工具的方法，盡量善用我們現有的高效公共交通系統，帶出一些新的旅遊體驗，當然最重要的是希望吸引他們留港消費和過夜，亦希望「粵車南下」有此吸引力。

第三，我們需要做好完備配套，一直鼓勵主要發展商和私人停車場營運商商討盡快提升其轄下停車場的泊車配套。就泊車位，過去大家在議會亦有表達關注，我們需要繼續努力。為迎接粵車來港，我們需要特別做好三方面的支援。第一，停車場可支援以內地支付工具繳費；第二，提供國標充電裝置；第三，提供免接觸入閘設備，因為有些車輛是左軚，但本港車輛是右軚，隨着現時的設備和科技先進，可用免接觸式的方法以方便車輛入閘。同時，我們正在口岸停車場和大嶼山鄰近大橋口岸位置增設同時符合國標和歐標的快速充電設施。業界反應正面，現正加緊努力。

第四，為接受內地居民、在廣東領牌的合資格人士申請，粵港雙方會在驗車、牌證申請和保險安排方面推出措施，便利粵車遵從有關要求。在申請資格方面，根據廣東省交通運輸廳就「粵車南下」管理辦法徵求意見稿中列明，申請人需是持有有效中國居民身份證的內地居民，而車輛需要在廣東登記，並是領取有效牌證的非營運私家車，不超過八個座位，包括駕駛者座位，而指定駕駛者需持有香港正式駕駛執照。就車輛和人方面，也是根據「港車北上」的申請要求，每名申請人士可就其私家車指定不多於兩名司機，其中一名司機是申請人，駕駛往來香港和廣東省，做到綁定司機的安排。我們與廣東商討「粵車南下」的申請細節時，亦會涵蓋類似的安排，而粵港相關的交通和執法部門亦會繼續商討，確保因應此安排便利日後執法，以及作妥善操作的安排。

預期「粵車南下」將讓嶄新客群包括消費力更高的個人和家庭，自駕來港數日旅遊、經商、出席展覽或會議、使用專業服務和休閒飲食。

「粵車南下」的各項準備工作已經進入最後階段，待與粵方進一步確定細節後，我們將適時公布詳情，爭取於今年十一月實施。就車輛停泊在機場口岸停車場及入境這兩部分，我們爭取在十一月內接受申請。我們亦預期機場口岸停車場可在十一月內開始接受預訂及啓用。至於粵車入境市區，我們希望在今年年底內可有有相關車輛訪港。「粵車南下」整個申請流程、演練正陸續進行，令安排有序執行。

正如剛才所說，我們正聯絡業界把握機遇，為新客群提供消費、泊車和住宿優惠，帶動旅客至各區的景點和住宿設施，酒店等業界已表示支持。我希望透過今日的會議，多聽議員意見，讓我們有更多想法以細化工作。接着，希望借助業界及社會各界助力為「粵車南下」營造正面氛圍。

最後，一條大橋可便利雙向奔赴、帶動百業受惠，從而締造無限機遇。我們有信心「粵車南下」將有序推展，達致用家歡迎、市民安心、社會獲益多方共贏的效果。多謝主席，我們非常樂意聽取議員的意見及提問。"

尊敬的成林常委（北京市委常委、組織部部長李成林）、尊敬的唐永剛局長（中央組織部人才工作局局長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

今天我很榮幸可以代表香港特別行政區來到北京參與2025高水平人才高地建設論壇。在此，我代表香港特別行政區政府熱烈祝賀論壇取得圓滿成功。

人才已成為最稀缺、全球競逐的最重要資源，誰搶得、留下最好的人才，就可以奠定未來發展的最好的基礎。今天，北京舉辦2025高水平人才高地建設論壇，就是向全世界展示北京的魅力、北京雄厚的實力，在全球人才戰當中顯示北京獨特的優勢。

香港作為國家對外的窗口，作為「一國兩制」實踐的最重要土地，也肩負着打造國際高端人才集聚高地的任務。在本屆政府李家超特首的帶領下，我們本着用好「一國兩制」的優勢，發揮香港作為全國唯一城市以普通法為法律基礎、作為全球三大金融中心之一、有效連接法治資金制度的優勢，致力面向全球，提供制度的創新、政策的支援；而且也通過一系列的行動，讓全球的人才都聚到香港，為香港的經濟作貢獻，為香港的科技發展作貢獻，更要為國家的科技發展、經濟發展作出貢獻。

香港的優勢，是「一國兩制」、與世界規則對接的優勢、教育資源的優勢，是歐美和海外的專家學者要落地中國這塊土地的時候，最方便、最容易落降的一個平台。不管是對他們的孩子、對他們創業的需要，香港都是最方便的試板。通過香港，我們可以將人才共享共用。事實上，過去香港在人才的工作也得到了世界的認可。在剛剛發布的《2025年世界人才排名》當中，香港從去年的第九位，上升到今年的全球第四位，名列亞洲第一。此外，在創新集群方面，「深圳—香港—廣州」在今年排名世界第一 。所以能看到，不管是我們的人才政策、創科政策，都好好的發揮香港「一國兩制」的優勢，為國家作出香港獨特的貢獻。

特區政府非常重視教育、科技、人才一體化的發展，已經成立了由政務司司長領導的教育、科技和人才委員會，全力在政策、資源、支援方面為人才到港發展提供全面的協助，更好地發揮香港的優勢。此外我們在創科方面也提出了三項百億元的計劃，希望通過香港政策資源的投入，帶動私營資金一起投放，讓香港成為金融以外的另一個創科的樂土。

在此，我期待香港與北京可以更好的聯動，發揮好香港「一國兩制」的優勢，用好北京首都圈無與倫比的優勢，做到一加一大於二的效果。在此我預祝論壇取得圓滿成功，謝謝大家。"

​申訴專員全面調查漁農自然護理署處理狗隻新領及續領牌照的安排（附圖）,2025-10-17 11:00,2025-10-17 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101600689.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（十月十七日）宣布展開全面調查，詳細審研現時漁農自然護理署（漁護署）處理為狗隻新領及續領牌照的程序和機制。

《狂犬病規例》規定，在本港超過五個月大的狗隻都必須領有牌照、接種狂犬病疫苗和植入晶片。漁護署轄下各區動物管理中心提供為狗隻注射預防狂犬病疫苗及簽發牌照和植入晶片的服務。

申訴專員公署接獲市民的申訴，指他最近帶同已植入晶片的狗隻到漁護署的動物管理中心為該狗隻新領牌照時，才得悉漁護署加入了新要求，狗主必須出示狗隻的合法來源證明（例如從寵物店購買狗隻的收據或狗隻的防疫注射記錄），才能為狗隻申領牌照。申訴人最終須帶同狗隻回家取回證明，再返回中心以完成手續。申訴人指漁護署未能為加入該項新要求作合理的解說，又指當時該署的網頁沒有提及該要求。

陳積志表示：「飼養狗隻作寵物在香港越趨普遍，《行政長官2025年施政報告》也包括推廣寵物友善場景的措施。社會逐漸傾向人寵共融，漁護署為申請狗隻牌照訂立的程序和要求必須合理，向市民提供的資訊亦必須清晰，方便狗主適時為狗隻領牌、接種疫苗及植入晶片，以及為狗隻續牌及再次接種疫苗，這對於防止狂犬病爆發及有效監察狗主履行責任，以維護狗隻權益和福利至為重要。因此，我決定展開這項全面調查，詳細審研現時漁護署處理狗主為狗隻新領及續領牌照的機制和程序，以及探討當中有否改善空間，提出適切改善建議，優化漁護署服務以便狗主妥善照顧其狗隻。」

申訴專員歡迎市民以書面提出意見。請於二○二五年十一月十七日或之前把意見送達申訴專員公署：

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (October 17) announced the launch of a full investigation into the procedures and mechanisms currently employed by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) in handling dog licence applications and renewals.

The Rabies Regulations require all dogs in Hong Kong reaching the age of 5 months or above to be licensed, vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. The AFCD's Animal Management Centres provide anti-rabies dog inoculation and licensing and microchipping services.

The Office of The Ombudsman received a public complaint that the complainant recently brought his microchipped dogs to an AFCD Animal Management Centre to apply for their first dog licences. Upon arrival, he was informed that the AFCD had introduced a new requirement whereby dog owners must provide proof of the legal origin of their dogs, such as a receipt for purchasing the dog from a pet shop or the dog's vaccination record, in order to apply for a dog licence. Eventually, the complainant had to return home with his dogs to obtain the required proof and revisited the centre to complete the procedure. The complainant alleged that the AFCD was unable to reasonably explain the rationale for the new requirement, and there was a lack of information about the new requirement on its website.

Mr Chan said, ""Keeping pet dogs is increasingly common in Hong Kong. The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address also includes measures to promote a pet-friendly culture. Our society is gradually embracing pet inclusivity. It is crucial for the AFCD to establish reasonable procedures and requirements for dog licence applications and renewals and to provide clear information to the public so as to facilitate dog owners in licensing, vaccinating and microchipping their dogs, as well as renewing dog licences and re-vaccinating their dogs in a timely manner. These measures are essential for preventing the outbreak of rabies and effectively monitoring whether dog owners have fulfilled their responsibilities, thereby protecting the rights and welfare of dogs. In this light, I have decided to launch a full investigation into the AFCD's mechanisms and procedures for handling dog licence applications and renewals to identify any areas for improvement. Pertinent recommendations will be made for enhancing the AFCD's services, with a view to facilitating dog owners in taking proper care of their dogs.""

The Ombudsman welcomes views from members of the public on this topic. Written submissions should reach the Office of The Ombudsman by November 17, 2025:
