Speech by FS at Belgian King's Day Reception (English only) (with photos),2025-11-14 21:09,2025-11-14 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400811.htm," Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Belgian King's Day Reception today (November 14):

Consul General Lomastro (Consul General of Belgium in Hong Kong, Mr David Lomastro), Deputy Commissioner Hua You (Deputy Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Ambassador Harvey Rouse (Head of the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good evening.

 It is my pleasure to join you in celebrating Belgium's King's Day — a day to honour His Majesty King Philippe.

 I'm also delighted to take this opportunity to address the Belgian community here in Hong Kong, and extend my warm regards to the Consul General, who has been with us since August 2022.

 Back in 2022, Hong Kong — like much of the world — was just beginning to emerge from the shadow of the pandemic. We have come a long way since then.

 Over the past few years, despite various challenges, Hong Kong has remained firmly anchored in the core principles that define us under the ""one country, two systems"" framework: common law and the rule of law, free port status allowing free flow of capital, talent, goods and information, and a low and simple tax regime. Equally unwavering is our openness to international businesses and talent — a key strength that enables us to serve as the bridge between the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world.

 In a global landscape increasingly marked by unilateralism, protectionism and uncertainty, we believe that staying true to these values is the best way to navigate shifting terrain and seize emerging opportunities.

 This year has been a promising one for Hong Kong. Our financial markets have been among the world's top performers — not just in equities and IPOs, but also in bond issuance, asset and wealth management, green and sustainable finance, and digital assets. These developments reflect the confidence that international investors continue to have in Hong Kong as a global financial hub and a destination for opportunities.

 Our economy is also showing solid momentum. Just earlier today, we revised our GDP growth forecast for the year to 3.2 per cent, driven by strong exports and a remarkable surge in tourism. The number of international visitors has grown by around 16 per cent, and we are seeing a steady return and growth of global flight connections — including, as the Consul General mentioned, the welcome resumption of direct flights between Hong Kong and Brussels.

 Looking ahead, Hong Kong is well-positioned to create even more opportunities for global investors — including those from Belgium and across Europe. The recent Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee laid out the country's development roadmap under the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan, reaffirming China's commitment to high-level, two-way opening up.

 In essence, China is welcoming more foreign investments and businesses, while at the same time encouraging Mainland enterprises to go global, to reconfigure their supply chain and industry chain, and to open up new markets.

 For Belgian and European businesses, Hong Kong offers a familiar and trusted platform from which to explore the vast opportunities on the Chinese Mainland and across Asia, especially in the dynamic Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

 But Hong Kong is more than just a financial and trading hub. We are building a new engine of growth powered by innovation and technology which offers great collaboration opportunities with Belgian companies and institutions.

 The Northern Metropolis is the carrier of this vision, and we are fast-tracking the development of this new land of opportunity.

 A key highlight for Belgium businesses is the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Co-operation Zone along the Shenzhen River. There will be many policies breakthrough in this zone — for example, the seamless cross-boundary flow of people, capital, goods, data and even biosamples. For instance, clinical trial institutions from both sides are now working together in the zone to accelerate clinical trials, streamline approval process, and shorten time-to-market for new drugs and medical devices developed there. I believe this is particularly attractive for Belgium's world-class pharmaceutical companies.

 Sustainability is another key area of common interest between Hong Kong and Belgium. We are the sustainable finance hub of Asia, and I look forward to Belgian and Hong Kong institutions to work together to provide leadership on the path to net-zero emissions.

 Meanwhile, art, culture and entertainment are also vital pillars of our collaboration and exchange.

 That spirit is on full display during the Belgian Days in Hong Kong, starting from today as the Consul General mentioned. Ten days of food, beer, fun, film, art and exhibitions — and yes, even a chocolate festival. Very much my kind of festival.

 Residents and visitors alike will no doubt savour every moment, and for that, I thank the Consulate for bringing this wonderful experience to life.

 Before I close, for all Hong Kong residents here, I encourage you to vote at the Legislative Council Election on December 7. It is important for our future.

 Thank you very much."

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉新投票安排措施（附圖）,2025-11-14 20:35,2025-11-14 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400800.htm,"下稿代選舉管理委員會發出：

為便利選民投票，回應選民的實際需要，選舉管理委員會（選管會）將在二○二五年立法會換屆選舉推出新的投票安排措施。

選管會主席陸啟康法官今日（十一月十四日）在記者會上介紹有關新投票安排時表示，選管會以穩中求進的態度持續優化選舉的各項安排，務求進一步提升選舉的效率及便利各持份者。

陸啟康法官説：「近年我們聽到社會各界包括立法會的意見，當中不乏有需要在投票日工作的選民，礙於工作性質、工作時數及值班安排等情況，他們未必有充足時間在上、下班前後或用膳期間及時往返其所屬的指定投票站進行投票，因而無法行使他們的投票權。」

「有見及此，選管會在今次立法會換屆選舉中，將因應這些有特定需要的選民群組推出一些專屬投票站的先導安排。」

專屬投票站

先導安排下的專屬投票站有以下三類：


公務員專屬投票站
	選舉事務處將設立共10個公務員專屬投票站，便利紀律部隊以及其他在鄰近地點值班的公務員投票，方便他們在完成投票程序後盡快返回工作崗位。
	
醫院管理局醫護人員專屬投票站
	選舉事務處將分別在七間最大規模的醫院附近，設立共七個醫院管理局醫護人員專屬投票站，便利在投票日需要在有關醫院值班的醫護人員投票。
	
少數族裔人士專屬投票站
	選舉事務處將在投票日當天分別在灣仔錫克廟及九龍清真寺附近設立兩個少數族裔人士專屬投票站，以便利在上述兩個場所出席宗教活動的少數族裔選民投票。


院舍外展投票站

另外，為便利入住安老院或殘疾人士院舍的院友在一個熟悉、安全又安心的環境，按照自己的意願進行投票，選舉事務處將會在院舍所處的建築物內設置院舍外展投票站。作為先導安排，選舉事務處會為11間安老院及四間殘疾人士院舍提供有關服務，並會開放給上述院舍的職員使用，以便他們在完成投票程序後可繼續工作。

以上專屬和外展投票站與一般投票站的安排相同，各候選人及其監察投票代理人均可申請在投票日當天在有關投票站內監察投票過程，以示公正。

鄰近邊境投票站

此外，有見及二○二三年區議會選舉的成功經驗，選舉事務處在今次選舉中除了在上水設立鄰近邊境投票站外，亦會在港珠澳大橋旅檢大樓以及香港國際機場各設立一個鄰近邊境投票站，進一步方便往返內地及海外的選民，以及在投票日需在該兩個地點值勤的選民。

登記方法

有意使用鄰近邊境投票站的選民須預先登記，以將其投票地點由原屬票站改往相關的鄰近邊境投票站，登記詳情稍後會上載至選舉專用網站。

新推出的各專屬投票站及外展投票站的先導安排只適用於指定選民群組，選舉事務處會聯絡相關的政策局、部門及團體進行相關的登記安排。

陸啟康法官說：「作為嶄新的試行安排，選管會及選舉事務處會確保一切籌備工作順利進行，確保有關選務工作在公開、公正、誠實及安全有序下順利進行，並進一步使投票安排更加人性化。選管會會在選舉完結後，就所有選舉安排包括今次新推出的措施進行檢討。相關檢討結果和建議會載於選舉報告書內。」

投票時間

陸啟康法官在記者會上亦宣布延長投票時間的安排。他說：「近日我們也聽到不少意見，希望調整投票時間，以方便一些可能因工作或值班安排、需要處理個人或家庭事務，或當日須北上參加旅行團等原因，而未必能在現有14個小時投票時間期間進行投票的選民。」

「經仔細考慮，我們將會延長投票時間，分別提早一小時由早上七時三十分開始，並延遲一小時至晚上十一時三十分結束，共16個小時投票時間。」

選舉事務處較早前已備妥向全港選民寄出的投票通知卡及相關資料，當中列明的投票時間，即早上八時三十分至晚上十時三十分，已經更改。因應新投票時間，選舉事務處將向全港選民寄出另一份通知，列明新的投票時間，即早上七時三十分至晚上十一時三十分。

出席記者會的政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞説：「政府對今次的立法會換屆選舉極為重視。我十分感謝選管會與選舉事務處推出一系列嶄新的先導安排，力求令選舉更加高效、更加人性化、更加貼合巿民需要。」

選管會委員石丹理教授和文本立資深大律師，以及選舉事務處總選舉事務主任陳淑華亦出席今日的記者會。

最後，陸啟康法官再次呼籲全港選民在十二月七日踴躍投下神聖的一票，履行公民責任，共同為香港創造更美好的未來。

二○二五年立法會換屆選舉所有投票站及地址將於下星期在憲報刊登。"

Building Safety Symposium successfully held (with photos),2025-11-14 19:58,2025-11-14 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400769.htm,"More than 300 building professionals, property management practitioners, academics, government officials and non-governmental representatives attended the Building Safety Symposium organised by the Buildings Department (BD) at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre today (November 14). They explored innovative solutions to enhance building safety and advance the future development of the industry by delving into the application of innovative technologies in optimising building design, repair and maintenance, and construction site safety management.
 
Speaking at the symposium, the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, said that the use of new technologies to enhance building safety and efficiency is an inevitable trend. The Government is committed to promoting construction digitalisation, including plans to announce a revamped roadmap for Building Information Modelling (BIM) by the end of this year to progressively extend BIM application to private development projects of different scales.

With regard to construction and site safety, Ms Linn said that the Government is actively promoting the Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) method. The guidebook to facilitate cross-boundary trade of MiC modules has been released earlier, along with the implementation of MiC Manufacturer Accreditation Scheme, to encourage more MiC projects. The Government will conduct central procurement on a trial basis in the first half of next year, piloting in the procurement of commonly used materials including steel reinforcement and MiC modules, and will also launch a Project Cost Management Platform to establish a market price database. Moreover,the Government will continue to promote the wider adoption of the Smart Site Safety System (4S) in the industry. Over 550 public and private construction sites have been awarded the 4S label so far.

Ms Linn said that the use of innovative technologies such as AI and the like is essential to the work of the BD. She expected that the department will further enhance co-operation with the industry to promote the application of more innovative technologies in areas including building maintenance and repair, building safety design, digital services platform and data interoperability, and so on.

In the welcoming speech of the Director of Buildings, Mr Ho Chun-hung, he said that the BD is dedicated to exploring and utilising innovative technologies to enhance the regulation of building safety and its services. He cited the BD's proactive approach to inspect the external walls of high-risk buildings, using drones and AI to assist with the inspections and analysis of building defects.

To enhance enforcement efficiency, the BD launched last month an electronic case management and reporting platform, which could automatically generate warning letters upon expiry of the due dates of statutory orders, replacing the manual process of issuing letters. Owners can also access the platform via the BD website or by scanning the QR code on the letter to report their compliance with orders and notices.

To promote wider adoption of BIM in the industry and enhance the design, construction and maintenance of buildings, the BD has developed a series of automated checking tools. These include area, fire safety and structural checking tools, which are available for download free of charge from the BD website. This enables the industry to verify in advance whether their designs comply with the Buildings Ordinance. The BD will also launch a tool for checking building separations for compliance with the sustainable building design guidelines by the end of the year.

Mr Ho said that the BD will continue to work hand in hand with the industry to seize the opportunities arising from technological advancements and digital transformation, with the aim of creating a safer and more sustainable built environment.

The Building Safety Symposium is the closing event of Building Safety Week 2025. The theme of this year's symposium is ""Digital Transformation for Safer Building Design, Construction and Maintenance"". In the symposium, a number of local experts spoke on the following topics:

• Integration of Advanced Technologies to Enhance Construction Safety;
• Digital Works Supervision System: Enhancing Safety and Quality through Smart Site Management;
• Urban Renewal Authority in Building Rehabilitation - The Lighthouse in the Darkness;
• Smart Governance: Digital Transformation for Building Control and Sustainability;
• Embodied AI in Construction; and
• Implementation of Advanced Technologies for Maintenance of Existing Buildings.

In addition to the above speeches, the symposium featured two panel discussion sessions, enabling industry professionals and expert speakers to share insights and explore the implementation and development of building safety in more depth.

In addition, an award presentation ceremony for the Building Safety Pioneer Programme was held during the symposium to commend student pioneers for applying their knowledge of building safety by running interactive game booths at the BD Open Day last Saturday (November 8), thus fulfilling their mission to promote building safety to the public. An award presentation ceremony for the Building Façade Design Competition was also held today. This competition aimed to encourage the public to actively participate in building a livable community and make them understand the close relationship between building maintenance and their daily life. The winning entries are currently on display at the MTR Community Art Gallery in Yau Ma Tei MTR Station.

Building Safety Week is a major event of the BD's public education and publicity efforts. Over the past week, the BD has organised an open day and an experience-sharing session, with the aim of further promoting building safety messages to the public through a series of activities."
蚊傳疾病基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況（附圖）,2025-11-14 19:50,2025-11-14 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400749.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十四日）公布基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況。

基孔肯雅熱
—————

截至今日下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

個案涉及一名27歲女子，居於屯門區。初步調查顯示，她於十月二十七日至十一月十日到訪古巴及墨西哥，自十一月十二日起出現發燒、皮疹及關節痛等病徵，昨日（十一月十三日）到屯門醫院急症室求醫，並入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。病人有一名家居接觸者，結伴到古巴及墨西哥，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期內身處中美洲，中心認為她是在海外期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並會把個案通報相關衞生部門。

本港今年累計錄得62宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

至於昨日（十一月十三日）確診基孔肯雅熱的68歲女子，中心仍在進行病毒基因分析工作。中心呼籲該名患者居住的筲箕灣東熹苑一帶居民，如於十月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和東區關愛隊已接觸有關居民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

中心人員已與東區的關愛隊向東熹苑一帶受影響地區約3 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的資料單張及問卷，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

今日下午，中心與東區民政事務處在興東邨興康樓地下香港西區婦女福利會關啟明紀念松鶴老人中心合辦教育講座，以加深市民對這種蚊傳疾病的認識，一同參與防控工作，護己護人。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於筲箕灣興東商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於東熹苑進行上門探訪，為逾1 900名在較高風險地區工作或居住的市民進行評估，並為兩名出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查。

登革熱
———

由十一月七日至昨日（十一月十三日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期到過菲律賓。

截至昨日，今年錄得53宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞去年（二○二四年）錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。由二○二五年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點亦普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年已分別錄得超過四萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 500宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得3 209宗本地感染病例，其中196宗病例於十月二十七日至十一月二日的一周內錄得，以潮州、廣州、深圳、汕頭和佛山錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

繼續加強防控
——————

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

•在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
•巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
•加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

As of 5pm today, one new imported CF case has been recorded.

The case involves a 27-year-old female living in Tuen Mun District. Initial investigation revealed that she travelled to Cuba and Mexico between October 27 and November 10. She developed a fever, rash and joint pain from November 12 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department at Tuen Mun Hospital yesterday (November 13). She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. Her blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. She is currently in stable condition. The patient's household contact, who accompanied her to Cuba and Mexico, is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

Since the patient stayed in Central America during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected overseas. The case is classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it will report the case to the relevant health authorities.

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 62 confirmed CF cases this year. Four of these cases were local, and the rest were imported.

Regarding the 68-year-old female confirmed with CF yesterday (November 13), the CHP is conducting the genome analysis. The CHP urged the residents in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, where the patient resides, to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they present with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP officers and the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams have already reached out to the local residents, reminding them to be aware of relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinityof Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

This afternoon, the CHP also collaborated with the Eastern District Office to organise a health talk at the Kwan Kai Ming Memorial Chung Hok Elderly Centre of Women's Welfare Club Western District Hong Kong on G/F, Hing Hong House, Hing Tung Estate. The aim is to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 1 900 individuals residing or working in higher-risk district through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. Two individuals with mild symptoms have also been arranged to undergo blood tests.

Dengue fever
---------------

 From November 7 to yesterday (November 13), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to the Philippines during the incubation period.

 As of yesterday, 53 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over 4 million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

 DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 40 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 3 209 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 196 cases were recorded in a week between October 27 and November 2, with the highest number of cases recorded in Chaozhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shantou and Foshan.

 Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

 TheFood and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


 The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

 Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


 The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

 The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
CHP appeals to parents to arrange seasonal influenza vaccination for their children as soon as possible especially young children aged 6 months to under 2 years,2025-11-14 19:43,2025-11-14 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400747.htm,"In view of the influenza activity remaining at a relatively high level, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 14) appealed to parents again to arrange a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) for their children early, especially young children aged 6 months to under 2 years, to reduce their risk of serious illness and death from seasonal influenza.

""With the promotion efforts made by the Government and the support from all sectors of the society, over 1.33 million doses of vaccines have been administered since the launch of the 2025/26 SIV Programmes (including the SIV School Outreach Programme, the Residential Care Home Vaccination Programme and Vaccination Subsidy Scheme) in late September, representing an approximately 3.9 per cent increase compared to the same period last year. However, the coverage rate of children aged 6 months to under 2 years is relatively low, which is about 14 per cent only. As in the past, severe or death cases associated with influenza this season primarily affect the elderly and children. However, compared to the winter influenza season earlier this year, children have been particularly affected this season and there has been more severe paediatric influenza infection cases.Eighteen severe influenza cases involving children have been recorded so far this summer influenza season, including two fatal cases. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years. Nine cases have been recorded since the launch of this year's SIV Programmes, with only one having received this year's SIV four days prior to the onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, in other words, these severe influenza cases are not protected by the vaccine,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

He urged parents to arrange SIV for their children as soon as possible, and hope all sectors of society could join hands in educating parents on the importance of vaccination. This will promote a greater vaccine uptake among young children, increase the vaccination coverage rate, and strengthen protection for children.

  ""Through the Primary Healthcare Commission, the CHP has urged family doctors to assist in encouraging parents to give consent for their children to receive SIV, especially young children aged 6 months to under 2 years who were unvaccinated. The Government has opened all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years to receive the vaccine. Moreover, the District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission in the 18 districts, and 74 Family Medicine Clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For the list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system,"" said Dr Tsui.

Regarding schools, to boost SIV rates, enrolment for the SIV School Outreach Programme has started since the beginning of June this year, which was earlier than last year. The CHP has also introduced enhancement measures. All schools may opt for the nasal live attenuated influenza vaccines and the ""hybrid mode"", which allows schools to choose both the injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and the nasal live attenuated influenza vaccines during the same or different outreach vaccination activities. With the concerted efforts of the Government and various community sectors (including the medical sector and schools), approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) are going to arrange SIV school outreach activities.

""In view of the continued increase in influenza activity and the number of school outbreaks since the start of the school year, the CHP has actively contacted the schools since mid-last month, urging them to try to further advance school outreach activities where feasible. Twenty-three schools have responded to the CHP's call to advance their outreach activities, originally scheduled for December this year or January next year, to be held by the end of this month. To date, over 2 220 schools (96 per cent) are going to arrange SIV school outreach activities by the end of this month, while all participating schools will conduct the SIV school outreach activities by the end of December, which are higher than the 83 per cent and 91 per cent recorded respectively during the same period last year. Thanks to the schools' concerted efforts in expediting the SIV outreach activities, reported school influenza outbreaks have significantly decreased recently. The number of school outbreaks fell from the peak of 169 cases in the week of October 12 to 18, to 61 cases last week. I believe that the School Outreach Programme has offered greater convenience for parents, resulting in a vaccination coverage rate of about 44 per cent for children aged 2 to under 12. I hope that more schools will participate in the School Outreach Programme in future, providing greater convenience for pupils and safeguarding their health,"" Dr Tsui said.

He reminded members of the public that, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

「樓宇安全研討會」順利舉行（附圖）,2025-11-14 19:15,2025-11-14 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400645.htm,"超過300位來自建築業界、物業管理業界、學者、政府及非政府機構人士，今日（十一月十四日）齊集香港會議展覽中心，出席屋宇署舉行的「樓宇安全研討會」，深入探討如何將創新科技應用於優化建築設計、樓宇復修保養及工地安全管理等關鍵領域，共同為提升樓宇安全及推動未來行業發展尋求創新方案。

發展局局長甯漢豪在研討會上表示，運用新科技提升建築安全及效率是大勢所趨，政府積極推動建築業數碼化，包括推動業界廣泛應用建築信息模擬技術（BIM），計劃在今年年底公布經優化的路線圖，以循序漸進方式將建築信息模擬技術應用擴展至不同規模的私人項目。

在建造及工地安全方面，甯漢豪表示政府積極推動「組裝合成」（MiC）建築法，早前已發布「組裝合成」通關便利指南及推行「組裝合成」製造商認證計劃，以推動更多「組裝合成」項目。政府將於明年上半年試行中央集中採購鋼筋和「組裝合成」構件等常用物料，並會推行「成本管控數碼平台」，建立市場價格資料庫。此外，政府持續推動業界廣泛採用「安全智慧工地」系統（4S），至今已有超過550個公私營工地獲得「安全智慧工地」系統標籤。

甯漢豪指出，應用人工智能等創新技術對屋宇署的工作尤為重要，期望在更多相關領域，包括樓宇維修保養、樓宇安全設計、政府部門數碼平台數據互通等，加強與業界合作，攜手推動更多創新技術的應用。

屋宇署署長何鎮雄致歡迎辭時表示，屋宇署一直致力發掘和透過創新科技以提升樓宇安全的監管和服務。他舉例說，屋宇署主動對潛在風險較高的樓宇外牆進行勘察，並運用無人機以及人工智能協助勘察及分析外牆欠妥之處。

為提升執法效率，屋宇署在上月推出了電子化「個案管理與報告平台」，針對逾期未遵辦的法定命令及通知，自動發出警告信，取代以往人手擬備信件的程序；業主亦可透過屋宇署網頁或掃描信件上的二維碼登入平台，匯報遵辦命令或通知的情況。

為了進一步推動業界採用建築信息模擬技術以提升樓宇設計、建造和保養，屋宇署開發了一系列自動核查工具，包括面積、消防安全及結構核查工具，可於屋宇署網頁免費下載，讓業界在入則前預先核查設計是否符合《建築物條例》的規定。今年年底，署方亦會推出有關樓宇間距的核查工具，以利便業界符合可持續建築設計的指引。
  
何鎮雄說，屋宇署會繼續與業界攜手，把握科技發展和數碼轉型的機遇，共同建設一個更安全及可持續的建築環境。

「樓宇安全研討會」是「樓宇安全周2025」的閉幕活動。本屆主題為「數碼轉型：推動更安全的建築設計、建造及保養」。多位本地專家分別就以下議題發表演講：


「整合先進科技提升建造安全」；
「數碼工程監督系統：透過智慧工地管理提升安全與質量」；
「市建局之樓宇復修—暗黑中之明燈」；
「智慧監管：樓宇管制與可持續發展的數碼轉型」；
「具身智能在建造業的探索」；及
「運用先進科技保養現存樓宇」。


除上述演講外，研討會亦包括兩場專題討論環節，讓業界與專家講者即時交流專業見解，進一步探討樓宇安全的實踐與發展。

此外，研討會上亦舉行了「樓宇安全學生大使計劃」頒獎典禮，表揚學生大使將樓宇安全知識學以致用，並在上周六（十一月八日）舉行的「屋宇署開放日」製作攤位遊戲，履行向公眾推廣樓宇安全的使命。今日同場亦舉辦了「外牆大翻新設計比賽」頒獎禮，該項比賽旨在鼓勵市民積極參與建設宜居社區，讓他們了解樓宇維修保養與日常生活息息相關。得獎作品現正在油麻地港鐵站港鐵社區畫廊展出。
​
「樓宇安全周」是屋宇署推動公眾教育及宣傳的重點活動。過去一周，署方先後舉辦開放日和經驗分享會等活動，期望透過多元方式進一步向市民傳遞樓宇安全信息。"

15th National Games athletics (marathon) event to be held tomorrow,2025-11-14 19:14,2025-11-14 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400733.htm,"  The 15th National Games (NG) of the People's Republic of China ""The China Telecom Trophy"" Athletics (Marathon) Competition will take place on November 15. The event will be the first cross-boundary marathon in the history of the NG, spanning Hong Kong and Shenzhen utilising the Shenzhen Bay Bridge as the track. The entire track is 42.195 kilometres long, of which the section in Hong Kong is 21.85 km. Starting from the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center, participants will enter Hong Kong via the Shenzhen Bay Port, run along the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and Kong Sham Western Highway Viaduct, then return to the Shenzhen Bay Port through the same route, and finally finish at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center.

  The event includes men's and women's races, with the participation of 69 athletes consisting of 36 male athletes and 33 female athletes. Among them, two male athletes and three female athletes are from Hong Kong. The men's group will start at 7am and the women's group at 7.30am. The athletes will enter the Hong Kong section after completing approximately 2 km of the race route. Both groups are expected to spend around two hours in the Hong Kong section. As part of the track is within the Frontier Closed Area, no public viewing zone will be set up in Hong Kong in order to ensure the event runs smoothly and is well managed. Members of the public can watch the broadcast on television.

ããTo facilitate the smooth running of the race, clearance services of the Shenzhen Bay Port (including all passenger and cargo clearance services) will be suspended during part of the morning on the event day, while temporary control measures will be implemented on the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and other related roads. Members of the public and visitors should pay attention to the following key points:

ã Arrival and departure clearance services at the Shenzhen Bay Port will be suspended from 2am to 11am on the event day. Passengers and vehicles will also be prohibited from entering the port. Meanwhile, temporary control measures will be implemented on the Shenzhen Bay Bridge, the Kong Sham Western Highway and Ha Tsuen Interchange. During the temporary control period, the Shenzhen Bay Bridge, the Kong Sham Western Highway and Ha Tsuen Interchange will be closed to all vehicular traffic from eastbound and westbound of Yuen Long Highway and Ha Tsuen Road.

ã Cross-boundary vehicles (including good vehicles, passenger vehicles and private cars) with valid closed road permits for the Shenzhen Bay Port may choose to use the the Lok Ma Chau (Huanggang), Heung Yuen Wai and Man Kam To boundary control points (BCP) according to the operating hours of the relevant control points during the suspension of arrival and departure clearance services at the Shenzhen Bay Port on the event day. The above special arrangements will cease upon the reopening of the Shenzhen Bay Port.

ã Cross-boundary coach services running between Hong Kong and the Mainland via the Shenzhen Bay Port as well as local public transport services serving the Shenzhen Bay Port, including franchised buses, green minibuses (GMB), urban and New Territories taxis, will be suspended during the aforementioned period. The bus companies and GMB operators will display notices at en-route stops of the affected routes and company websites to inform affected passengers. Travellers should choose other control points to Shenzhen.

ããDuring the suspension of the Shenzhen Bay Port arrival and departure services, the TD expects the roads leading to the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang, Man Kam To and Heung Yuen Wai BCPs, including San Tin Interchange, San Sham Road and Lok Ma Chau Road, will be busy with traffic. Therefore, the TD appeals to cross-boundary private cars and other drivers to avoid driving to the above districts during the relevant hours. Depending on the prevailing traffic conditions in the area, the Police will deploy appropriate manpower and implement corresponding crowd management measures or special traffic arrangements at the affected control points and relevant road sections. In case of traffic congestion, please exercise tolerance and patience and drive carefully, and follow the instructions of the Police on site.

  For details of the special traffic and transport arrangements for the race, please refer to the TD Notice: www.td.gov.hk/en/traffic_notices/index_id_83680.html.

  The National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) (NGCO) has liaised with relevant government departments and organisations to disseminate information on the relevant BCPs clearance services and transportation arrangements to be implemented for the event to the public, travellers and stakeholders through various channels, including:

  The TD will liaise with public transport operators to suitably adjust the services to cater for passenger demand, and issue transport departmental notice of the traffic and transport arrangements for the event and appeal for cross-boundary and local travellers and members of the public via various channels to take heed of arrangements for various public transport travelling to and from the Shenzhen Bay Port and plan their journeys early, including the HKeMobility mobile application, variable messages signs at strategic roads and tunnels, public announcement at MTR stations, Agent T Facebook page (www.facebook.com/AgentT.hk).

  The Marine Department has liaised with cross-boundary ferry operators, with a view to working out manpower and sailing schedule arrangements for ferry services to and from Shekou, Shenzhen, in advance.

   The Home Affairs Department has disseminated the relevant message through the district network (including District Councils, Area Committees and District Committees, Youth Committees, as well as District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams)).That includes distributing leaflets in some of the affected areas so that residents could be informed of the special transportation arrangements for the day of the event and thus plan and adjust their travel accordingly.On the day of the event, the Care Teams will deploy staff to inspect the affected districts, and provide appropriate assistance to members of the public in need (e.g. providing information on public transport arrangements and responding to enquiries).

   Hong Kong Customs has informed the transport trades of the traffic arrangements on that day and to use other land BCPs as far as possible for entry and exit. Customs has also posted notices at the clearance facilities of the Hong Kong Port and informed the public through its website (www.customs.gov.hk/en/home/index.html) and social media platform.

   The Immigration Department (ImmD) will update the situation of the control points in real time through its mobile application on the event day. Travellers are advised to check the waiting time situation of the Shenzhen Bay Control Point and other land BCPs through the ImmD's mobile application before travelling to make better planning for their itinerary and minimise waiting time.

   The Police will also remind the public of the temporary traffic control arrangements through its social media platform (www.facebook.com/HongKongPoliceForce).

   The Tourism Commission (TC) has informed the hotel sector through their trade associations to remind their guests of the special transportation arrangements. The TC has also informed licensed travel agents through the Travel Industry Authority and the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong to avoid bringing tour groups across the Shenzhen Bay Bridge on the event day. The Hong Kong Tourism Board has also notified its trade partners and disseminated the relevant information on its website (www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/index.html) to facilitate visitors' itinerary planning.

   A spokesperson for the NGCO said as the NG is the country's highest-level event, this marathon event has to meet stringent requirements in terms of the selection of race course and the organisational arrangements to ensure the safety of athletes. Relevant departments will work together to facilitate the special traffic and transportation arrangements to minimise the impact on the public and travellers who usually use the Shenzhen Bay Port. The spokesperson thanked members of the public and travellers for their understanding, as well as the contributions of various organisations and departments to implementing the relevant arrangements."
Commissioner for Digital Policy inspects information systems of 15th National Games venues (for photos),2025-11-14 19:08,2025-11-14 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400730.htm,"  The Commissioner for Digital Policy, Mr Tony Wong, visited the Technical Operation Centre of the 15th National Games (NG) in Hong Kong and various competition venues including those for fencing, basketball, track cycling, rugby sevens and triathlon for two consecutive days (November 13 and 14).

The DPO is committed to providing precise, stable, and efficient core information and technology systems for the 15th NG, including sensor technology, scoring systems, detection devices, and arbitration camera systems, as well as the setup of network infrastructure to ensure the fairness and smooth operation of the competition events. For the NG, the DPO has deployed over 3 200 devices and more than 20 information systems, mobilising over 400 technical personnel across various venues. A Technical Operation Centre has also been set up for 24-hour real-time monitoring and centralised command to support all the competition events held at the Hong Kong competition zone. The DPO has also maintained close co-ordination with the responsible units in both Guangdong Province and Macao, demonstrating resource integration and joint operations with a strong team spirit.

  During his inspection of the fencing venue, Mr Wong highlighted that sensor technology and scoring systems are particularly important for fencing competitions, which demand extremely high precision. Colleagues are required to conduct repeated testing to ensure the systems can provide instant feedback to safeguard the absolute fairness and accuracy of the competition results. He expressed his appreciation for the on-site technical team's dedication to ensuring system stability and real-time responsiveness, and operating seamlessly in sync with the pace of the competitions.

  Mr Wong conducted a key inspection of the track cycling finishing line at the Hong Kong Velodrome to assess the operational efficiency of the timing and testing equipment, pointing out that the equipment accurately captures the athletes' finishing times. Equipped with high-precision photo-electronic timers and lap time recording devices for athletes, the equipment is crucial for determining race results and monitoring. The entire system, using high-end technology sensor devices and intelligent algorithms, ensures zero error in judgements.

  The area of the rugby sevens match field is vast, which results in a massive cabling project and the transmission of images from multiple cameras. These cameras are indispensable equipment in the refereeing system supporting officiating and replay reviews. Mr Wong expressed his gratitude to the working team for their professional dedication as well as hard work in overcoming the complex cabling challenges to ensure that video surveillance covered the entire match field.

  During his visit to the triathlon competition venue which involves an extensive coverage area and a very high standard of technical requirements, Mr Wong was briefed by colleagues on the integration of drone operations into the referee system, which provides real-time Ultra HD aerial images and multi-angle views, effectively assisting the referee team in making accurate judgements. This exemplifies how innovation and technology can enhance the fairness of the competition, demonstrating the advanced value of technology in empowering sports.

  Mr Wong also paid a special visit to the technical operations centre to learn about the system monitoring arrangements and operational mechanisms during the competitions. He acknowledged the team’s professional attitude in ensuring the smooth flow of competition information and operation, and commended their close collaboration with leading cybersecurity experts in Chinese Mainland introduced specially by the DPO for the NG and their outstanding performance with zero incidents despite facing various complex and ever-changing cyber challenges during the high-pressure competition period. He then encouraged the team to strictly adhere to the principle of ""respond instantly, recover rapidly"", and remain highly vigilant and be prepared at all times to deal with any kind of emergencies that may arise during the event. He emphasised that rapid response and effective co-ordination are key to ensuring ""zero interruption"" to the Games, adding that close teamwork is the only way to guarantee the smooth running of the event.

  The DPO will release a series of short videos during the events through its Facebook page (www.facebook.com/digitalpolicyhk). Members of the public are invited to watch and learn more about how information technology supports this national large-scale event."
勞工及福利局局長為2025國際復康日慶祝典禮主禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-11-14 19:06,2025-11-14 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400707.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十一月十四日）下午為2025國際復康日慶祝典禮主禮的致辭全文：

Benny主席（香港復康聯會主席兼國際復康日籌備委員會主席張偉良）、林美秀女士（平等機會委員會主席）、立法會議員狄志遠、Anthony（香港社會服務聯會業務總監黃健偉）、康復諮詢委員會（康諮會）主席馮伯欣、康諮會副主席劉健華博士、康諮會就業小組委員會主席繆志仁、Winnie（康復專員姜梁詠怡）、Maggie（社會福利署副署長（服務）梁綺莉），還有各位好朋友：

今年是國際復康日33周年，很高興能夠出席慶祝典禮，時間過得很快，去年典禮還在眼前，轉眼間又再來到這裏。我理解今日的主題比較多跟就業有關，過去幾年政府在促進殘疾人士就業方面做了很多工夫，當然仍有進步空間，我們先看已做了的工作，再往前看哪些地方可以再加強。

剛剛Benny提到的「愛心僱主」獎章是一個嶄新的想法，剛剛今年推出，我們評估反應很好，頒獎典禮已剛於十月舉行，合共185間機構獲得嘉許，分別獲頒發「第一級：殘疾共融支持機構」、「第二級：殘疾共融僱主」及「第三級：殘疾共融先鋒」奬章。我們希望鼓勵參與的機構拾級而上，更重視社會共融以期升上更高級別——這是今年第一步，吸引了180多間機構。再做下去的目標，第一是增加「愛心僱主」的數目，第二我們也可動一動腦筋，不只是嘉獎，亦可增加其他誘因令僱主僱用殘疾人士。大家有好意見不妨向我們提供，希望能更好發揮殘疾人士的能力，其實他們當中很多能力都很好，就如我們今日兩位主持也做得很好，要想想如何令他們的整體就業機會得到增長。

其他幾項工作大家也很熟悉了，例如「創業展才能」和勞工處的就業展才能計劃，我們會持續投入資源。但最重要是政府和香港復康聯會、社福界的好友，當然還有康復諮詢委員會等多些聯動，多聽大家的意見，如何令大家可以在就業方面有更多機會。除此以外，尤其是年輕一輩的教育水平其實也很高，如何可以用好這些受到良好高等教育，但可能有少許殘疾的人士，不只做一些傳統的工作，也值得我們去思考。

另一方面大家都明白，殘疾光譜其實很闊，有些是肢體、有些是其他不同方面的殘疾，需求都不一樣，看看如何可以把工作再細化。我期待未來日子可以用好科技，科技進步得很快，以往科技可能是純粹讓生活舒服一點，但我理解越來越多科技例如可以幫助步行以及更好控制觸感等，如能引入多些不斷進步的科技，說不定能為殘疾人士大大減低他們的障礙。

隨着國家的科技飛躍進步，有很多新的國產科技產品可以應用，最大的優點是價錢相對便宜很多，讓我們能將有限資源用得更好，來幫助有需要的殘疾人士。我期待在未來的日子，無論是就業、科技應用方面，都可見到進步。每年我們都會定一些目標，希望到下一年國際復康日34周年的典禮，屆時可以在台上提到更多新進展！再一次感謝Benny和大家請我前來，希望大家可以多些支持今日的活動，慷慨解囊。

最後，這段日子無論我出席任何活動都會提到——十二月七日是立法會換屆選舉，十二月三日是國際復康日，大家慶祝完後，過四日要再齊齊出動，十二月七日請大家一定要齊齊出來投神聖的一票，選出大家心儀的議員。多謝各位。"
數字政策專員視察十五運會場館資訊系統（附圖）,2025-11-14 19:00,2025-11-14 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400669.htm,"數字政策專員黃志光一連兩日（十一月十三日及十四）到訪第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）香港賽區技術運行中心及多個比賽場館，包括擊劍、籃球、場地自行車、七人制橄欖球、鐵人三項等賽事場地，實地了解各場館資訊系統和各項科技裝置的運行情況，並提示同事本週末比賽場次達高峰時段，對資訊系統和技術支援工作的是重大考驗，他勉勵同事繼續發揮專業精神，確保所有賽事能穩定順利進行。

數字政策辦公室（數字辦）早於二○二四年初已成立專責團隊，全面啓動十五運會籌備工作，並與國家體育總局體育信息中心及內地技術專班一直保持緊密合作，全力為十五運會提供精確、穩定及高效的核心資訊系統建設，包括感測技術、計分系統、檢測裝置及視頻判決等，以及網絡基礎設施搭建，以支援賽事公正及暢順進行。數字辦為賽事共部署了逾3 200台設備和20多套資訊系統，動員超過400名技術人員分布於各場館，同時設立技術運行中心，24小時實時監察與統籌指揮，支援所有香港賽區場館的比賽項目，並與廣東省及澳門的負責單位緊密協調，發揮資源整合與協同運作的整體團隊精神。

黃志光視察擊劍場館期間，特別關注感測技術及計分系統對擊劍比賽尤其重要，必須具備極高的精確性，同事需要反覆測試以確保系統能夠即時反饋，確保比賽結果的絕對公正與準確。他對現場技術團隊致力確保系統的穩定與實時回饋，配合比賽節奏以達到無縫運作，表示讚賞。

黃志光在香港單車館重點視察了場地自行車比賽終點處，了解計時與檢測裝置的運作效能。他指出該裝置負責準確捕捉選手衝線瞬間的時間數據，配備高精度電子拍照計時設備及選手每圈圈速記錄裝置，對賽果判定與賽事監控至關重要。整套系統以高科技感應裝置配合智能演算法，能確保判決零誤差。

七人制橄欖球比賽場地面積廣闊，涉及龐大的布線工程及多台攝像機的影像傳輸，這些攝像機是裁判系統不可或缺的設備，用於助判和回放審查。黃志光感謝工作團隊的專業付出，努力克服複雜的布線難題，確保攝像監察覆蓋整個比賽場地。

黃志光在視察覆蓋範圍和技術要求極高的鐵人三項比賽場地時，聽取同事介紹在裁判系統引入的無人機運作，提供即時超高清空中影像和多角度視野，有效協助裁判組作出準確判決，是創新科技應用提升比賽公正性的好例子，充分展現科技賦能體育的先進價值。

黃志光亦特別到技術運行中心了解賽事期間的系統監測安排與運作機制，他對團隊以專業態度確保賽事資訊和運作暢通表示肯定，並讚揚團隊與數字辦為十五運會特別引入的內地頂尖網安專家緊密合作，於高壓的賽事期間面對各種複雜多變的網絡挑戰下仍保持零事故的卓越表現。他又勉勵團隊嚴守「即時應變、快速復原」的原則，時刻保持高度警覺和充足準備，以應對賽事期間可能出現的各種突發狀況。他強調，快速反應和有效協調是保障「賽事運作零中斷」的關鍵，只有團隊緊密合作，才能確保賽事順利進行。

數字辦在賽事舉行期間，會透過Facebook專頁（www.facebook.com/digitalpolicyhk）發布一系列短片，歡迎市民瀏覽，了解資訊科技如何賦能香港支援這場國家級大型盛事。"
反非法勞工行動拘二十六人（附圖）,2025-11-14 18:45,2025-11-14 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400695.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十一月七日至昨日（十一月十三日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「曙光行動」、「光影行動」、聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」，以及聯同食物環境衞生署和康樂及文化事務署執行的「驚愕行動」。截至昨日（十一月十三日），行動中共拘捕二十名懷疑非法勞工及六名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

反非法勞工行動中，調查人員搜查了多個目標地點，包括餐廳、裝修中單位、貨倉及按摩店等，共拘捕二十名懷疑非法勞工及六名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為十二男八女，年齡介乎二十九至六十二歲，當中一男一女涉嫌行使及管有懷疑偽造身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為四男兩女，年齡介乎三十八至五十七歲。

有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

26 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-11-14 18:45,2025-11-14 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400696.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Twilight"", ""Lightshadow"", a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"", and a joint operation with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department codenamed ""Flabbergast"" from November 7 to yesterday (November 13). A total of 20 suspected illegal workers and six suspected employers were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations including restaurants, renovation flats, warehouses and massage parlours etc. Twenty suspected illegal workers and six suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised 12 men and eight women, aged 29 to 62. Among them, a man and a woman were suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. Four men and two women, aged 38 to 57, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or an identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit the ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
Government to flexibly deploy staff to ensure city's smooth operation on polling day and enable civil servants to cast their votes (with photo),2025-11-14 18:30,2025-11-14 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400691.htm,"  To ensure the smooth operation of the entire city on the polling day of the Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election, the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) today (November 14) issued a direction to Permanent Secretaries and Heads of Departments to establish a dedicated ""Polling Day Coordination and Support Centre"" in the departments under their purview on December 7 and make flexible deployments of additional manpower on the polling day. This includes arranging for civil servants who are normally scheduled to rest on Sundays to be on duty on the polling day, having regard to operational needs of the departments, to give full support to the work of the LegCo Election. They also have to take all possible measures to enable civil servants who are on duty on the polling day to cast their votes.

  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, said, ""The LegCo is an important component of the political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Ensuring the success of the eighth LegCo General Election is an important task for the HKSAR Government and all government departments have a responsibility to give full support to this. By flexibly deploying additional manpower to work on the polling day and providing all possible facilitation measures for civil servants on duty, we can ensure a smooth and orderly operation of the city and smooth voting by citizens, and at the same time enable civil servants to exercise their right to vote.""

  A CSB spokesman said that departments will deploy additional manpower in a flexible manner in accordance with the CSB's direction and mobilise civil servants to render full support to the work on the polling day to achieve the following objectives:

(1) to ensure the normal and orderly operation of the city, prevent potential risks or incidents, and safeguard the smooth conduct of voting across all districts in Hong Kong;

(2) to ensure proper monitoring of the smooth operation of all public services, facilities, and key infrastructure;

(3) to ensure smooth communication and co-ordination channels at all levels within the department to enable ""early planning and early intervention"" so that unforeseen issues can be promptly and effectively addressed;

(4) to ensure sufficient manpower support for swiftly assisting departments in need to cope with emergency situations as and when necessary; and

(5) to ensure sufficient manpower support for appealing to and encouraging all sectors of the community to cast their votes early.

  The spokesman said that over 30 000 civil servants will work for the election at polling stations and counting stations on the polling day. In addition, different departments have long arranged manpower to stay on duty on Sundays, including the disciplined services responsible for maintaining law and order as well as the units responsible for providing public services to the general public on Sundays, such as public markets, sports centres, libraries, etc. These departments will increase staffing levels as needed. They may also set up support and co-ordination service posts at public facilities to provide information to the public in need and encourage them to vote. Other departments will also flexibly deploy additional manpower to go to work.

  Although more civil servants will go to work on the polling day than in previous years, the CSB has instructed all departments to implement all possible measures to enable civil servants on duty to cast their votes. These measures include:

(1) arranging for civil servants scheduled to work on the polling day to be released in an orderly manner for a short period of time to vote at polling stations, including allowing civil servants on duty to ""vote first, then go to work"" during their shift, or to leave work early to vote, thereby saving travelling time. Civil servants on duty can receive time-off or overtime allowance in accordance with prevailing regulations;

(2) arranging sufficient manpower for replacements to ensure public services remain unaffected;

(3) arranging for reimbursement of travelling expenses between the place of work and the polling stations assigned for civil servants who vote during their duty hours; and

(4) arranging for departments' staff unions and volunteer teams to encourage and assist colleagues in need to vote at their designated polling stations on the polling day.

  The CSB has earlier established a dedicated task force to oversee and co-ordinate election-related publicity and mobilisation efforts for the civil service. It has also directed the civil service leadership and their respective policy bureaux and departments (B/Ds) to set up leading task forces to implement publicity and mobilisation initiatives, including engaging with the public, different sectors and frontline colleagues, and producing promotional videos.

  In addition, the CSB has issued guidelines to B/Ds stating that if civil servants, including staff union representatives, need to temporarily leave their work to attend officially organised events during working hours (such as ""Patriots Collaborate for Good Governance"" 2025 Legislative Council election forums), they may apply to their respective departments. Departmental management will consider operational needs and grant approval where circumstances permit."
衞生防護中心呼籲家長盡快安排子女接種季節性流感疫苗　特別是6個月至2歲以下幼童,2025-11-14 18:25,2025-11-14 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400699.htm,"由於流感活躍程度仍然處於較高水平，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十四日）再次呼籲家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，特別是6個月至2歲以下幼童，減低他們因感染季節性流感而出現重症甚至死亡的風險。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃（包括季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃、院舍防疫注射計劃及疫苗資助計劃）自九月下旬展開至今，在政府全力宣傳和社會各界的支持下，已接種超過133萬劑疫苗，較去年同期上升約3.9%。但6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有約14%。今季與流感相關的嚴重或死亡個案和以往一樣，主要影響『一老一幼』。然而，對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童尤其受到影響，嚴重個案亦較多。今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得18宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括兩宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的九宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。」

他呼籲家長盡快安排子女參加流感疫苗接種，亦希望社會各界攜手教導家長接種疫苗的重要性，以推動更多幼童接種疫苗，提高覆蓋率，加強保障小朋友。

徐樂堅醫生說：「中心已經透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵家長同意為子女接種季節性流感疫苗，特別是尚未接種的6個月至2歲以下的幼兒。為便利市民接種疫苗，政府已開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下18區的地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間家庭醫學診所和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。」

學校方面，為提高接種率，中心今年提早於六月初開始接受學校報名參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，亦推出優化措施，讓所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗或「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。在政府和社會各界（包括醫療界和學校等）的共同努力下，有約2 300間學校（總數的99%）會舉行流感疫苗學校外展活動。

徐樂堅醫生說：「因應今年開學後流感活躍程度和學校爆發宗數持續上升，中心自上月中旬已積極聯繫相關學校，敦促他們在可行的情況下，嘗試進一步提早接種疫苗的外展活動服務。有23間學校響應中心呼籲，將原訂於今年十二月或明年一月舉行的疫苗外展活動，提前至本月底前進行。截至目前，超過2 220間學校（96%）會於本月底或之前進行疫苗外展活動，所有參與學校將於十二月底前進行活動，分別高於去年同期的83%和91%。全賴學校通力合作，盡快進行流感疫苗外展活動，近期學校呈報的流感爆發個案已大幅回落，呈報數目由十月十二日至十八日一周的169宗高峰，下降至上周的61宗。我相信亦因為學校外展計劃為家長提供了便利，2歲至12歲以下兒童的疫苗覆蓋率已達約44%。我希望日後更多學校參與外展活動，為學童提更便利和保障他們的健康。」

他提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

 The Fire Services Department (FSD) mounted operations against illicit fuelling activities in Kwun Tong District on April 25 and May 28, seizing a total of about 3 150 litres of fuel and stopping the same man. The man was prosecuted for breaching the Fire Services Ordinance and the Dangerous Goods Ordinance, with a total of four charges laid against him. He was convicted at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts and sentenced to one month's imprisonment for each charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.

 Under the Fire Services (Fire Hazard Abatement) Regulation, it is an offence to possess or control any controlled substance for the business purpose of transferring it into vehicle fuel tanks. The Dangerous Goods Ordinance also provides that no person shall manufacture, store, convey or use any dangerous goods unless they possess a licence or exemption granted. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty for the first offence is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for six months. For each subsequent offence, the maximum penalty will be a $200,000 fine and imprisonment for one year.

 The FSD is committed to combating illicit fuelling activities through a multipronged strategy to ensure the safety of the community. Members of the public are reminded to refrain from participating in such activities and patronising illegal fuelling stations.

十一月份第二批涵蓋九個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及九個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十一月共兩批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共24個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這24個監察區中，16個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有八區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the second batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas in November, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released two batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in November 2025, covering 24 survey areas. Among these 24 survey areas, 16 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. October 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Eight other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside thepremises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

公務員事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-11-14 17:38,2025-11-14 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400649.htm,"以下是公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵今日（十一月十四日）下午到公務員學院向培訓中的公務員宣傳二○二五年立法會換屆選舉後，會見傳媒的談話內容：

公務員事務局局長：午安，各位傳媒朋友，大家好﹗大家也看到特區政府已經全力為立法會選舉做準備，無論在宣傳或實務方面，我們也全程投入，為辦好一個公平、暢順的選舉而全力以赴。

今日我來到公務員學院，向一批來自20多個職系，在這裏接受管理培訓的初級管理人員作出呼籲，請他們在投票日投票，而且第一是要聯同家人齊投票，第二是早些投票，第三就是要在當日都呼籲其他親友同事去積極投票。同事反應都好積極，紛紛表示他們一定會做到這幾點。

在實務方面，為了確保立法會選舉投票日的市面整體運作暢順，公務員事務局今日向常任秘書長和部門首長發出指示，在十二月七日在轄下部門特別設立「投票日統籌及支援中心」，並靈活調配額外人手在投票日上班，包括按部門運作需要，安排一般星期日休息的公務員於投票日當值，全力支援立法會選舉工作，同時必須採取一切可行措施，便利當值的公務員當日去投票。

投票日當天，在投票站和點票中心負責選舉工作的公務員有三萬多人。此外，不同部門一向有人手在星期日值勤，包括負責維持社會秩序和治安的紀律部隊和負責在星期日向市民提供民生服務的單位，例如公眾街市、體育館、圖書館等。在平日的星期日，一般都有超過二萬名公務員是要上班的，因為投票日的緣故，部分部門已經預定了要增加人手，例如警隊、民政事務總署和各區民政事務處等。

在此之上，我們要求部門靈活調配額外人手，動員公務員全力支援投票日的工作，包括我剛才提到運作部門「投票日統籌及支援中心」，以及在部門的各個重點崗位值班，以達致以下的目的：

一、確保市面運作正常有序，防範可能出現的風險或者事故，保障全港各區投票過程暢順；
二、確保妥善監察所有公共服務、設施和重要基建暢順運作；
三、確保部門各級聯絡和協調渠道暢通，做到早部署、早介入，務求盡快並有效應對任何突發的問題；
四、確保有充足的人手，必要時迅速地支援有需要的部門應付緊急的情況；及
五、確保有充足的人手，宣傳呼籲和鼓勵社會各界及早投票。

舉例來說，一些負責城市基建的部門可能需要增加應對突發事故的人手，務求若發生事故的話，可以在最短時間內應對並且解決；向市民提供民生服務的單位，亦可以增加值勤的人數，在公共設施設立支援協調服務點，為有需要的市民提供資訊和呼籲市民投票。

雖然投票日要上班的公務員人數較平常為多，公務員事務局要求各部門必須為值班的公務員提供一切可行的措施，便利他們完成投票。這些措施包括：

一、安排投票日要上班的公務員在值班期間輪流有序短暫離開工作崗位前往投票站投票，包括允許值班的公務員在當值時間內先投票、後上班，或提早下班前往投票，以節省來回的交通時間。值班公務員可以按現行的規定獲發補假或超時工作津貼；
二、安排充足的替補人手，確保公共服務不受影響；
三、安排發還往返辦公室和其所屬票站的交通費予值班期間前往投票的公務員；及
四、安排部門的工會和義工隊在投票日鼓勵和支援有需要的同事前往所屬的票站投票。

我先跟大家說到這裏，看看大家有沒有問題。

記者：除了該三萬人外，多少人是額外調配回來需要取消休假上班？另外，之前政府稱公務員要以身作則投票，但是投票可能都是個人選擇，這個說法會否令到一些公務員有壓力，以及投票後會否要求公務員向部門首長匯報，或以心意卡來表示自己已投票？

公務員事務局局長：第一個問題，我剛才都提到，選舉當日負責跟選舉有關的工作的公務員有三萬多人，平日在星期日根本要上班的公務員都一定超過二萬人。我們現在額外要求更多公務員在當日上班，無論是去處理一些應付突發事情的工作，或者做一些呼籲選民去投票的工作，或者在一些服務點提供資訊、一些額外的資料予市民等，這些是在以上的兩個數字之外、我們要求部門提供的人手。我們今日發出指引後，部門會需要按他們個別的情況去再計算一下人手需求。不過，我們估計是一定是五位數字的，一定是上萬的人手。

記者：見到安排公務員可以短暫離開工作崗位，即如果是警察、救護、消防這一類公務員，是否都可以適用這個安排？

公務員事務局局長：是的，所有當日要上班的公務員、要值班的公務員，這個安排都適用，但我們亦請部門可以考慮讓同事遲點上班或早些下班，在他們上班之前或下班之後去投票。不好意思，剛才我尚有問題未答，問題是﹖

記者：會不會令到公務員投票有壓力，說要以身作則投票﹖

公務員事務局局長：我相信投票是公民的權利，亦都是公民的義務。我們需要有一個立法會能夠為市民發聲，所以每一個公民都有這個責任去投票，這一點無論對公務員、對其他人都是有說服力的一點。各界亦多次表達，公務員是有一個示範作用，因為選舉是政府安排的，我們選出來的立法會議員跟公務員亦有很密切的工作關係，所以公務員有示範作用這一點亦都是各界認同。我不覺得我們講這兩點會令公務員有壓力。第三點就是我們不會要求公務員向他們的上司作任何形式的證明他們已經投票。投票一定是個人的選擇，我們不會要求他們作任何形式的證明，更加不會要求他們有任何的投票傾向。

記者：本來星期日不用上班的現在可能都有機會要上班，以及可能要求補假予他們，會否擔心可能會影響到平日的人手安排，即是可能平日上班的人會減少，因為他們要補假。公務員事務局有沒有指引給各部門去跟從，即怎樣去安排人手、怎樣調配才可以讓平日的公共事務不受影響﹖

公務員事務局局長：在補假方面，我們請部門自己靈活處理，因為如果所有人都集中在一日補假的話，當然可能對日常的工作有少少影響，但是我亦相信很多同事如果申請發還補假，他們未必會選擇集中在同一日，各人根據工作需要或根據自己個人安排會希望在不同日子提取補假，所以這個我們交給部門去靈活處理。我相信，基於各人、各部門不同的處理，不會集中在一日，亦不會影響公共服務。

記者：補假或申領交通費的公務員是否需要一個投票證明，例如交通費是怎樣去處理，以證明自己的費用等？

公務員事務局局長：我們不需要同事有一個已經投票的證明。不過，同事如果是有濫用的話，這是一個很嚴重的行為失當，我們一定會用紀律機制去嚴肅處理。申請補假的同事就不需要，因為申請補假的同事，他要上班才會有補假，而他有沒有上班大家都很清楚。

記者：交通費是怎樣定？即是有一個限額或會根據該交通而定？

公務員事務局局長：交通費是以實際已經使用的數目去發還的機制。不過，如果當日不是在上班之前投票，即遲一些上班、在投票後才上班，或是提早一些下班去投票的公務員，而是在日中需要離開的公務員，我們都允許他如果是為了方便快捷起見，使用最快捷的交通工具，即包括的士，我們會發還該筆交通費。"
​運輸及物流局局長出席西九碼頭開幕暨「西九渡輪」啓動禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-11-14 17:22,2025-11-14 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400646.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十一月十四日）出席西九碼頭開幕暨「西九渡輪」啓動禮的致辭全文：

Bernard（西九文化區管理局董事局主席陳智思）、劉主席（珠江船務董事局主席劉廣輝）、Betty（西九文化區管理局行政總裁馮程淑儀）、珠江船務及富裕小輪同仁、傳媒朋友、香港市民：

各位午安。我前來的時候心情特別興奮。正如剛才Bernard所說，今日天朗氣清、風和日麗、秋高氣爽，當然要去郊遊、要來西九文化區，觀賞文化體育盛事，甚至在草地曬曬太陽，真是一件美事。今日又是星期五，雖然下午要上班，但我鼓勵大家，可以在下班後或周六周日，來到西九文化區享受清新空氣、陽光、海風。

今日很開心見證西九碼頭和「中環—西九龍」水上的士正式啓航的歷史性時刻。剛才Bernard提到要多謝的單位，其實最需要講多謝的是我本人和運輸署。我記得幾年前，當我們推出水上的士的概念時，大家都問其實是甚麼？是否真的有的士？水上服務會是怎樣？簡單和大家講講，我們的概念正正是希望利用好這麼漂亮的維港。香港和九龍之間只是一水之隔，透過水上的士服務，帶給市民或遊客一種「隨上隨落」，比較靈活、自由的服務。他們可以選取不同地點，包括旅遊景點，如現時中環、尖沙咀、西九、灣仔等地方，都有水上的士的身影。

我見到珠江船務團隊的幾位。我特別記得，當我們經歷了幾年籌備，推出水上的士時，剛好遇上疫情，但我們不遺餘力、努力不懈。疫情期間，我記得當時很多市民享受在戶外環境，坐船由中環到紅磡，享受海風、海邊的旅行。來到今日，推廣水上的士，不單是官方旅遊路線，還變成市民通勤的選擇，像剛才Bernard提到上班或辦公的人，都可選取水上的士服務。我們現時在交通積極推廣寵物友善，我們希望「中環—西九龍」航線做到寵物共融。平時看見很多市民帶着愛犬來到西九草地，他們可以乘坐這航線，更加方便。

除了水上的士「中環—西九龍」航線，在此跟大家「賣告白」，現時水上的士由中環至尖沙咀的航線，日後亦會延展至停靠西九，與「中環—西九龍」航線互補，作為加密班次。除西九外，值得一提的是，尖沙咀至鯉魚門航線星期六日亦有水上的士服務。這條航線相當受歡迎，體現集觀光旅遊和交通於一身。

講到如何將香港不同特色和優勢結合起來，雖然今日主席多番多謝我們在運輸界別的參與，其實我才應該多謝大家，因為你們在文化、旅遊、體育範疇，突顯交通這個環節能夠作為其中一個賣點。經過你們西九文化區的協助、促成和宣傳，加上珠江船務旗下的富裕小輪，才能優化本來可能比較沉悶的交通安排，變成亮點。就此，很希望能帶動日後公共交通，作為支持旅遊，或作為旅遊本身，起很好的示範作用。

在此想用少少時間，向大家宣傳一下。談到交通和旅遊，接下來臨近聖誕節前夕，十二月二十三日，我們將迎來第一批「粵車南下」進入市區的車輛。當他們駕駛自己的單牌車作為交通工具來到香港，我相信他們一定會首先想起西九文化區、故宮博物館，這一定會是他們的首選。我們怎樣可以推介給他們？除了駕車，或乘搭連接西九文化區的九巴（及城巴）觀光巴士外，他們在中環或灣仔，同樣可以到中環碼頭，選取這條水上的士航線，直接來到西九文化區。除了文化和交通可以crossover之外，我們現正積極與酒店業聯會、體育協會或餐飲協會商討，希望推介和建立公交旅遊線，正正當中最重要的，除了水上的士之外，觀光巴士、開篷巴士，或提供多種語言服務的電車全景遊，以至在天水圍、屯門一帶的輕鐵帶出深度地區遊，這些都可以為旅客，無論是內地、海外，甚至本地居民，編織公共交通的風景線，將我們的公共交通多元化。

除了公共交通和運輸政策與我們的生活息息相關、有無限發展潛能，另外一件我們大家都關心的事，一定是十二月七日立法會換屆選舉，同樣關乎「一國兩制」行穩致遠和特區良政善治，能助力行政機關和其他諮詢架構推動正面的經濟和民生發展。今日大家濟濟一堂，藉此機會在此向大家呼籲，希望你們本人、家人和朋友，以至機構員工，都踴躍參與十二月七日的選舉，投出神聖的一票，選出心儀的議員，將他們的聲音帶入議會，推動運輸及物流局，以至整個特區政府，向前推動各樣惠民生、拼經濟的政策，多謝大家。"

卓永興表示：「社會高齡化所衍生的挑戰與機遇影響社會不同方面，橫跨多個政策範疇，因此工作組成員包括全部15個政策局。」

卓永興續說：「工作組會探討如何善用社會資源和市場力量，推動跨界別合作和其與政府政策措施的協同作用，以制定適時對策應對社會高齡化。工作組也將檢視早前公布有關促進銀髮經濟措施的落實，並考慮進一步措施推動香港銀髮經濟的發展。」

工作組將於明年向行政長官提交報告。

各位傳媒朋友，大家好。正如行政長官一再強調，十二月七日的第八屆立法會選舉是香港邁向「由治及興」進程中的大事，是香港加快發展經濟、改善民生的大事，是關乎你我、關乎每一位香港市民的大事。因此，特區政府對今次的立法會換屆選舉極為重視，亦希望全港選民都能夠積極進行投票，選出愛國愛港立場堅定、有能力、有擔當、有熱誠的新一屆立法會議員。

過去一段時間，政府積極進行了一系列的選舉活動，包括舉辦了「行政立法同心治港創未來」研討會、立法會換屆選舉啓動禮，又在全港各地舉行「選舉進社區」巡迴互動展覽，而各司局長亦透過不同方式，例如拍攝短片、落區直接與巿民交流、或在日常公開活動、與相關業界團體交流等，宣揚投入選舉、共創未來的信息。這都是為了加深社會大眾對完善選舉制度、貫徹落實「愛國者治港」之下，行政立法機關相互促進，對「一國兩制」行穩致遠以至特區良政善治的重要了解，亦讓社會大眾了解到十二月七日立法會選舉對香港的民生經濟發展、對每一位巿民的切身福祉都息息相關，因此呼籲大家都須積極支持並踴躍投票。

從本星期二（十一月十一日）起舉行的一連串2025立法會「愛國者同心治港」選舉論壇，更加是加強了巿民和選民對各個候選人的認識和了解，而候選人亦可充分展示他們的政綱、觀點、理念和抱負，爭取選民的支持。

我們亦非常高興見到社會各界積極響應行政長官和選管會（選舉管理委員會）主席的號召，眾志成城投入選舉。而眾多機構、企業、組織和團體更一同傳揚投入選舉的信息，並肩負起社會責任，鼓勵屬下人員在投票日積極投票，並為員工提供各種投票便利。

在政府和社會各界的共同努力下，近日社會上的選舉氣氛非常熾熱。我十分感謝選管會與選舉事務處即使在積極籌備選舉各項環節的情況下，仍在選務上以識變、應變、求變的態度，不斷與時俱進、精益求精、勇於創新，推出一系列嶄新的先導安排，力求令選舉更加高效、更加人性化、更加貼合巿民需要，務求讓每一位選民都可以更方便快捷便地行使他們的投票權利及履行公民責任。

我感謝選管會一直以來和特區政府衷誠緊密合作，亦借此機會，再次呼籲全港選民在十二月七日的立法會選舉投票日，履行你們的公民義務和社會責任，為香港這個我們共同的家園，投下你手中重要關鍵的一票，選出代表你的立法會議員。多謝大家。"
​二零二五年第三季經濟表現及二零二五年本地生產總值和物價最新預測,2025-11-14 16:30,2025-11-14 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400515.htm,"政府今日（十一月十四日）發表《二零二五年第三季經濟報告》和二零二五年第三季度的本地生產總值修訂數字。

署理政府經濟顧問林幗瑛博士闡述二零二五年第三季的經濟表現，以及最新的二零二五年全年本地生產總值和物價預測。

要點

＊受出口繼續大幅上升及本地需求持續擴張帶動，香港經濟在二零二五年第三季表現蓬勃。實質本地生產總值在第三季按年增長3.8%，較上一季的3.1%增幅明顯加快。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值進一步上升0.7%。

＊電子相關產品需求強勁和亞洲區內貿易往來暢旺，帶動整體貨物出口在第三季繼續按年實質顯著增長12.1%。服務輸出亦按年實質明顯擴張6.3%，主要是受到訪港旅遊業和跨境運輸量持續增長，以及跨境金融服務活動活躍所支持。

＊本地方面，私人消費開支在第三季增速輕微加快，按年實質進一步上升2.1%，反映本地消費市道續見恢復。隨着經濟擴張及住宅物業市場回穩，整體投資開支的按年實質升幅加快至4.3%。

＊勞工市場在第三季放緩。經季節性調整的失業率由上一季的3.5%上升至第三季的3.9%。就業不足率亦上升。就業收入繼續錄得按年增長。

＊隨着科技行業蓬勃發展、市場對美國繼九月減息後進一步下調利率的預期升溫，以及環球貿易摩擦稍為緩和，市場氣氛正面，本地股票市場在第三季呈現強勁升勢。住宅物業市場在第三季進一步靠穩。住宅售價回升幅度較為明顯，租金維持強韌。

＊消費物價通脹在第三季維持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數按年上升1.0%，上一季的升幅為1.1%。主要組成項目的價格壓力大致受控。計及政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應，整體綜合消費物價指數在第三季按年上升1.1%。

＊展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間應會進一步穩健增長。環球經濟短期內維持溫和增長，加上近期中美貿易緊張局勢緩和，以及電子相關產品持續的需求，應會支持香港的貨物出口。訪港旅遊業繼續增長及金融市場活動暢旺應為服務輸出提供進一步動力。本地方面，美國自九月起重啓減息，有利資產市場氣氛，加上消費信心逐漸恢復及營商氣氛穩步改善，這些發展應有助提振消費及投資活動。政府多項發展經濟及開拓多元化市場的措施亦會提供支持。然而，各項外部不確定性，包括來自貿易壁壘的持續影響、美國的減息步伐，以及外部需求波動可能導致貨物出口增長放緩，需要密切關注。

＊考慮到今年首三季3.3%的實際增長數字以及短期展望，二零二五年全年實質本地生產總值增長預測由八月覆檢時的2%至3%向上修訂至3.2%。政府將繼續密切監察相關情況。

＊通脹展望方面，由於本地成本壓力仍然受控和外圍價格壓力不大，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。考慮到今年首三季的實際通脹情況，二零二五年基本和整體消費物價通脹率的預測分別由八月覆檢時的1.5%及1.8%向下修訂至1.2%及1.5%。 

詳細分析

本地生產總值

根據政府統計處今天發布的修訂數字，二零二五年第三季實質本地生產總值按年顯著增長3.8%（與預先估計相同），上一季上升3.1%。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值在第三季上升0.7%（與預先估計相同），上一季上升0.4%（圖）。

附表一載列了截至二零二五年第三季的本地生產總值及其主要開支組成部分的最新數字。各經濟環節在第三季的發展情況詳述如下。

對外貿易

整體貨物出口繼上一季按年實質上升11.5%後，在二零二五年第三季繼續顯著增長12.1%。電子相關產品需求強勁，加上亞洲區內貿易往來暢旺，為出口增長提供支持。參考對外商品貿易統計數字並按主要市場分析，輸往內地的出口維持雙位數升幅。輸往東南亞國家聯盟市場的出口繼續急升，輸往大部分亞洲先進經濟體的出口普遍錄得進一步升幅。輸往美國的出口回升，輸往歐洲聯盟的出口則錄得顯著收窄的跌幅。經季節性調整後按季比較，整體貨物出口在第三季實質下跌1.3%。

服務輸出繼上一季按年實質擴張 8.6%後，在第三季明顯擴張6.3%。所有主要服務組別的輸出展現進一步擴張。具體而言，受惠於訪港旅遊業和跨境運輸量持續增長，旅遊服務輸出和運輸服務輸出進一步上升。跨境金融服務活動在環球股市上升下表現活躍，支持金融服務輸出進一步顯著擴張。商用及其他服務輸出亦進一步輕微增長。經季節性調整後按季比較，服務輸出在第三季實質上升1.3%。

內部經濟

私人消費開支在二零二五年第三季增速輕微加快，反映本地消費市道續見恢復。私人消費開支在第三季按年實質上升2.1%，上一季上升 1.9%。經季節性調整後按季比較，私人消費開支實質微升0.1%。同時，政府消費開支繼上一季按年實質上升2.5%後，在第三季上升 1.9%。經季節性調整後按季比較，政府消費開支實質微升0.1%。

按本地固定資本形成總額計算的整體投資開支繼上一季按年實質上升1.9%後，在第三季的升幅加快至4.3%。購置機器、設備及知識產權產品的開支顯著上升，當中私營機構開支增幅尤為強勁。擁有權轉讓費用在去年同期低基數下急升。樓宇及建造開支跌幅收窄。

勞工市場

勞工市場在二零二五年第三季放緩。經季節性調整的失業率由上一季的 3.5%上升至第三季的3.9%。就業不足率亦由1.4%上升至1.6%。全職僱員每月就業收入中位數在第三季繼續按年增長，以名義計算升3.3%，以實質計算升2.2%。

資產市場

本地股票市場在二零二五年第三季呈現強勁升勢。隨着科技行業蓬勃發展、市場對美國繼九月減息後進一步下調利率的預期升溫，以及美國與多個經濟體達成貿易協議後環球貿易摩擦稍為緩和，市場氣氛好轉。恒生指數（恒指）在九月中飆升至四年高位，季末收報 26 856 點，較六月底高 11.6%。踏入第四季以來，本地股市交投保持暢旺，近日恒指的水平與九月底時相若。

住宅物業市場在第三季進一步靠穩。隨着季內美國啓動減息及本地金融市場表現強勁，市場氣氛大致上更趨正面。整體住宅售價在第三季內出現 2%的較明顯升幅。隨着近期住宅售價進一步靠穩，置業負擔指數在第三季微升，但與長期平均數相若。交投量方面，第三季送交土地註冊處註冊的住宅物業買賣合約總數維持在 16 700 份的高水平，與上一季相比幾無變動，但較一年前的低水平高 63%。整體住宅租金維持強韌，在第三季上升 2%，受惠夏季期間季節性租賃需求上升所進一步拉動。非住宅物業市場在第三季維持疲弱。所有主要市場環節的售價和租金仍然偏軟，交投活動則表現不一。

物價

消費物價通脹在二零二五年第三季維持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數在第三季按年上升1.0%，上一季的升幅為1.1%。主要組成項目普遍錄得輕微至溫和的按年變動，反映本地和外圍價格壓力大致受控。本地消費市場的復蘇尚處於起步階段，亦令供應商對調升價格持謹慎態度。計及政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應，整體綜合消費物價指數在第三季按年上升1.1%。

二零二五年本地生產總值和物價的最新預測

展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間應會進一步穩健增長。環球經濟短期內維持溫和增長，加上近期中美貿易緊張局勢緩和，以及電子相關產品持續的需求，應會支持香港的貨物出口。訪港旅遊業繼續增長及金融市場活動暢旺應為服務輸出提供進一步動力。本地方面，美國自九月起重啓減息，有利資產市場氣氛，加上消費信心逐漸恢復及營商氣氛穩步改善，這些發展應有助提振消費及投資活動。政府多項發展經濟及開拓多元化市場的措施亦會提供支持。然而，各項外部不確定性，包括來自貿易壁壘的持續影響、美國的減息步伐，以及外部需求波動可能導致貨物出口增長放緩，需要密切關注。

考慮到今年首三季3.3%的實際增長數字以及短期展望，二零二五年全年實質本地生產總值增長預測由八月覆檢時的2%至3%向上修訂至3.2%（附表二）。政府將繼續密切監察相關情況。

通脹展望方面，由於本地成本壓力仍然受控和外圍價格壓力不大，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。考慮到今年首三季的實際通脹情況，二零二五年基本和整體消費物價通脹率的預測分別由八月覆檢時的1.5%及1.8%向下修訂至1.2%及1.5%（附表二）。

Economic performance in third quarter of 2025 and latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025 (with photo/video),2025-11-14 16:30,2025-11-14 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400541.htm,"  The Government released today (November 14) the Third Quarter Economic Report 2025, together with the revised figures on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the third quarter of 2025.

  The Acting Government Economist, Dr Cecilia Lam, gave an account of the economic performance in the third quarter of 2025 and the latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025.

Main points

*The Hong Kong economy staged a robust performance in the third quarter of 2025, driven by a continued surge in exports and sustained expansion in domestic demand. Real GDP grew by 3.8% over a year earlier in the third quarter, picking up visibly from the 3.1% growth in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, real GDP rose further by 0.7%.

*Total exports of goods continued to grow markedly by 12.1% year-on-year in real terms in the third quarter, propelled by strong demand for electronic-related products and buoyant regional trade flows in Asia. Exports of services also expanded notably by 6.3% in real terms over a year earlier, mainly supported by sustained increases in inbound tourism and cross-boundary traffic, as well as vibrant cross-boundary financial service activities.

*Domestically, private consumption expenditure picked up slightly in growth in the third quarter, rising further by 2.1% year-on-year in real terms, reflecting the continued recovery of the local consumption market. Overall investment expenditure saw an accelerated increase of 4.3% in real terms over a year earlier, alongside the economic expansion and stabilisation in the residential property market.

*The labour market softened in the third quarter. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.9% in the third quarter from 3.5% in the preceding quarter. The underemployment rate also increased. Employment earnings continued to record year-on-year growth.

*The local stock market exhibited a strong uptrend in the third quarter amid positive market sentiments towards a thriving technology sector, rising expectations for further interest rate cuts in the United States (US) following the one in September, as well as some easing of global trade tensions. The residential property market stabilised further in the third quarter. Flat prices showed a more visible pick-up and rentals remained solid.

* Consumer price inflation stayed modest in the third quarter. The underlying Composite Consumer Price Index (Composite CPI) increased by 1.0% over a year earlier, following the 1.1% increase in the preceding quarter. Price pressures on major components were broadly in check. Including the effects of the Government’s one-off relief measures, the headline Composite CPI increased by 1.1% year-on-year in the third quarter.

*Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy should see further solid growth for the rest of 2025. Sustained moderate growth of the global economy in the near term, coupled with easing China-US trade tensions of late and persistent demand for electronic-related products, should lend support to Hong Kong's exports of goods. Continued increases in inbound tourism and vibrant financial market activities should provide further impetus to exports of services. Domestically, the renewed US interest rate cuts since September are conducive to asset market sentiment. Together with the gradual recovery in consumption confidence and steadfast improvement in business sentiment, these developments should help bolster consumption and investment activities. The Government's various measures to develop the economy and diversify markets will also provide support. Nevertheless, external uncertainties arising from the lingering impacts of trade barriers, the pace of US interest rate cuts, and the potential moderation in goods export growth due to fluctuations in external demand warrant close monitoring.

*Taking into account the actual outturn of 3.3% in the first three quarters of the year and the near-term outlook, the real GDP growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is revised up to 3.2%, from 2%-3% in the August round of review. The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation.

*On the inflation outlook, overall inflation should stay modest in the near term, as domestic cost pressures remain contained and external price pressures are subdued. Taking also into account the actual inflation in the first three quarters of the year, the forecasts for the underlying and headline consumer price inflation rates for 2025 are revised down to 1.2% and 1.5% respectively, from 1.5% and 1.8% in the August round of review.

Details

GDP

  According to the revised figures released today by the Census and Statistics Department, real GDP grew visibly by 3.8% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2025 (same as the advance estimate), having increased by 3.1% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, real GDP rose by 0.7% in the third quarter (same as the advance estimate), after a 0.4% increase in the preceding quarter (Chart).

  The latest figures on GDP and its major expenditure components up to the third quarter of 2025 are presented in Table 1. Developments in different segments of the economy in the third quarter are described below.

External trade

  Total exports of goods continued to grow markedly by 12.1% year-on-year in real terms in the third quarter of 2025, following a 11.5% increase in the preceding quarter. Strong demand for electronic-related products and buoyant regional trade flows in Asia supported export growth. Analysed by major market and with reference to external merchandise trade statistics, exports to the Mainland maintained double-digit growth. Exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations markets continued to soar, and those to most advanced economies in Asia generally recorded further increases. Exports to the US rose back, while those to the European Union recorded a visibly narrowed decline. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, total exports of goods declined by 1.3% in real terms in the third quarter.

  Exports of services expanded notably by 6.3% in real terms in the third quarter over a year earlier, after expanding by 8.6% in the preceding quarter. Exports of all major service groups showed further expansion. Specifically, exports of travel and transport services rose further thanks to sustained increases in inbound tourism and cross-boundary traffic. Exports of financial services expanded visibly further, supported by vibrant cross-boundary financial service activities amid advancing global stock markets. Exports of business and other services also grew modestly further. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, exports of services rose by 1.3% in real terms in the third quarter.

Domestic sector

  Private consumption expenditure picked up slightly in growth in the third quarter of 2025, reflecting the continued recovery of the local consumption market. Private consumption expenditure rose by 2.1% in real terms in the third quarter over a year earlier, after an increase of 1.9% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter to quarter basis, private consumption expenditure increased marginally by 0.1% in real terms. Meanwhile, government consumption expenditure increased by 1.9% in real terms in the third quarter over a year earlier, after rising by 2.5% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter to quarter basis, government consumption expenditure edged up by 0.1% in real terms.

  Overall investment expenditure in terms of gross domestic fixed capital formation saw an accelerated increase of 4.3% year-on-year in real terms in the third quarter, further to a 1.9% increase in the preceding quarter. Expenditure on acquisitions of machinery, equipment and intellectual property products rose visibly, with private sector spending showing particularly strong growth. Costs of ownership transfer surged against a low base in the same period last year. Expenditure on building and construction fell at a moderated pace.

The labour sector

  The labour market softened in the third quarter of 2025. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.9% in the third quarter from 3.5% in the preceding quarter. The underemployment rate also increased from 1.4% to 1.6%. The median monthly employment earnings of full-time employees continued to increase, by 3.3% in nominal terms or 2.2% in real terms in the third quarter over a year earlier.

The asset markets

  The local stock market exhibited a strong uptrend in the third quarter of 2025. Market sentiment improved amid a thriving technology sector, rising expectations for further US rate cuts following the one in September, as well as some easing of global trade tensions following trade agreements reached between the US and many economies. The Hang Seng Index (HSI) rallied to a four-year high in mid-September and closed the quarter at 26 856, up 11.6% from end-June. Entering the fourth quarter, trading activities in the local stock market have stayed vibrant, and the HSI closed at levels similar to that at end-September in recent days.

  The residential property market stabilised further in the third quarter. Market sentiment in general turned more positive amid the start of interest rate cuts in the US and strong local financial market performance during the quarter. Overall flat prices showed a more visible pick-up of 2% during the third quarter. The index of home purchase affordability edged up in the third quarter amid the further stabilisation in recent flat prices but was similar to the long-term average. The number of transactions, in terms of the total number of sale and purchase agreements for residential property received by the Land Registry, stayed high at 16 700 in the third quarter, little changed from the preceding quarter but 63% higher than the low level a year earlier. Overall flat rentals remained solid, rising by 2% during the quarter, boosted further by a seasonal surge in rental demand during the summer. The non-residential property market remained weak in the third quarter. Prices and rentals of all major market segments softened further, while trading activities showed mixed performance.

Prices

  Consumer price inflation stayed modest in the third quarter of 2025. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.0% in the third quarter over a year earlier, following the 1.1% increase in the preceding quarter. Major components generally saw modest to moderate year-on-year changes, as domestic and external price pressures were broadly in check. The nascent recovery of the local consumption market also kept suppliers prudent in raising prices. Including the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the headline Composite CPI increased by 1.1% in the third quarter over a year earlier.

​二零二五年第三季經濟表現及二零二五年本地生產總值和物價最新預測（附圖／短片）,2025-11-14 16:30,2025-11-14 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400515.htm,"政府今日（十一月十四日）發表《二零二五年第三季經濟報告》和二零二五年第三季度的本地生產總值修訂數字。

署理政府經濟顧問林幗瑛博士闡述二零二五年第三季的經濟表現，以及最新的二零二五年全年本地生產總值和物價預測。

要點

＊受出口繼續大幅上升及本地需求持續擴張帶動，香港經濟在二零二五年第三季表現蓬勃。實質本地生產總值在第三季按年增長3.8%，較上一季的3.1%增幅明顯加快。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值進一步上升0.7%。

＊電子相關產品需求強勁和亞洲區內貿易往來暢旺，帶動整體貨物出口在第三季繼續按年實質顯著增長12.1%。服務輸出亦按年實質明顯擴張6.3%，主要是受到訪港旅遊業和跨境運輸量持續增長，以及跨境金融服務活動活躍所支持。

＊本地方面，私人消費開支在第三季增速輕微加快，按年實質進一步上升2.1%，反映本地消費市道續見恢復。隨着經濟擴張及住宅物業市場回穩，整體投資開支的按年實質升幅加快至4.3%。

＊勞工市場在第三季放緩。經季節性調整的失業率由上一季的3.5%上升至第三季的3.9%。就業不足率亦上升。就業收入繼續錄得按年增長。

＊隨着科技行業蓬勃發展、市場對美國繼九月減息後進一步下調利率的預期升溫，以及環球貿易摩擦稍為緩和，市場氣氛正面，本地股票市場在第三季呈現強勁升勢。住宅物業市場在第三季進一步靠穩。住宅售價回升幅度較為明顯，租金維持強韌。

＊消費物價通脹在第三季維持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數按年上升1.0%，上一季的升幅為1.1%。主要組成項目的價格壓力大致受控。計及政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應，整體綜合消費物價指數在第三季按年上升1.1%。

＊展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間應會進一步穩健增長。環球經濟短期內維持溫和增長，加上近期中美貿易緊張局勢緩和，以及電子相關產品持續的需求，應會支持香港的貨物出口。訪港旅遊業繼續增長及金融市場活動暢旺應為服務輸出提供進一步動力。本地方面，美國自九月起重啓減息，有利資產市場氣氛，加上消費信心逐漸恢復及營商氣氛穩步改善，這些發展應有助提振消費及投資活動。政府多項發展經濟及開拓多元化市場的措施亦會提供支持。然而，各項外部不確定性，包括來自貿易壁壘的持續影響、美國的減息步伐，以及外部需求波動可能導致貨物出口增長放緩，需要密切關注。

＊考慮到今年首三季3.3%的實際增長數字以及短期展望，二零二五年全年實質本地生產總值增長預測由八月覆檢時的2%至3%向上修訂至3.2%。政府將繼續密切監察相關情況。

＊通脹展望方面，由於本地成本壓力仍然受控和外圍價格壓力不大，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。考慮到今年首三季的實際通脹情況，二零二五年基本和整體消費物價通脹率的預測分別由八月覆檢時的1.5%及1.8%向下修訂至1.2%及1.5%。 

詳細分析

本地生產總值

根據政府統計處今天發布的修訂數字，二零二五年第三季實質本地生產總值按年顯著增長3.8%（與預先估計相同），上一季上升3.1%。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值在第三季上升0.7%（與預先估計相同），上一季上升0.4%（圖）。

附表一載列了截至二零二五年第三季的本地生產總值及其主要開支組成部分的最新數字。各經濟環節在第三季的發展情況詳述如下。

對外貿易

整體貨物出口繼上一季按年實質上升11.5%後，在二零二五年第三季繼續顯著增長12.1%。電子相關產品需求強勁，加上亞洲區內貿易往來暢旺，為出口增長提供支持。參考對外商品貿易統計數字並按主要市場分析，輸往內地的出口維持雙位數升幅。輸往東南亞國家聯盟市場的出口繼續急升，輸往大部分亞洲先進經濟體的出口普遍錄得進一步升幅。輸往美國的出口回升，輸往歐洲聯盟的出口則錄得顯著收窄的跌幅。經季節性調整後按季比較，整體貨物出口在第三季實質下跌1.3%。

服務輸出繼上一季按年實質擴張 8.6%後，在第三季明顯擴張6.3%。所有主要服務組別的輸出展現進一步擴張。具體而言，受惠於訪港旅遊業和跨境運輸量持續增長，旅遊服務輸出和運輸服務輸出進一步上升。跨境金融服務活動在環球股市上升下表現活躍，支持金融服務輸出進一步顯著擴張。商用及其他服務輸出亦進一步輕微增長。經季節性調整後按季比較，服務輸出在第三季實質上升1.3%。

內部經濟

私人消費開支在二零二五年第三季增速輕微加快，反映本地消費市道續見恢復。私人消費開支在第三季按年實質上升2.1%，上一季上升 1.9%。經季節性調整後按季比較，私人消費開支實質微升0.1%。同時，政府消費開支繼上一季按年實質上升2.5%後，在第三季上升 1.9%。經季節性調整後按季比較，政府消費開支實質微升0.1%。

按本地固定資本形成總額計算的整體投資開支繼上一季按年實質上升1.9%後，在第三季的升幅加快至4.3%。購置機器、設備及知識產權產品的開支顯著上升，當中私營機構開支增幅尤為強勁。擁有權轉讓費用在去年同期低基數下急升。樓宇及建造開支跌幅收窄。

勞工市場

勞工市場在二零二五年第三季放緩。經季節性調整的失業率由上一季的 3.5%上升至第三季的3.9%。就業不足率亦由1.4%上升至1.6%。全職僱員每月就業收入中位數在第三季繼續按年增長，以名義計算升3.3%，以實質計算升2.2%。

資產市場

本地股票市場在二零二五年第三季呈現強勁升勢。隨着科技行業蓬勃發展、市場對美國繼九月減息後進一步下調利率的預期升溫，以及美國與多個經濟體達成貿易協議後環球貿易摩擦稍為緩和，市場氣氛好轉。恒生指數（恒指）在九月中飆升至四年高位，季末收報 26 856 點，較六月底高 11.6%。踏入第四季以來，本地股市交投保持暢旺，近日恒指的水平與九月底時相若。

住宅物業市場在第三季進一步靠穩。隨着季內美國啓動減息及本地金融市場表現強勁，市場氣氛大致上更趨正面。整體住宅售價在第三季內出現 2%的較明顯升幅。隨着近期住宅售價進一步靠穩，置業負擔指數在第三季微升，但與長期平均數相若。交投量方面，第三季送交土地註冊處註冊的住宅物業買賣合約總數維持在 16 700 份的高水平，與上一季相比幾無變動，但較一年前的低水平高 63%。整體住宅租金維持強韌，在第三季上升 2%，受惠夏季期間季節性租賃需求上升所進一步拉動。非住宅物業市場在第三季維持疲弱。所有主要市場環節的售價和租金仍然偏軟，交投活動則表現不一。

物價

消費物價通脹在二零二五年第三季維持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數在第三季按年上升1.0%，上一季的升幅為1.1%。主要組成項目普遍錄得輕微至溫和的按年變動，反映本地和外圍價格壓力大致受控。本地消費市場的復蘇尚處於起步階段，亦令供應商對調升價格持謹慎態度。計及政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應，整體綜合消費物價指數在第三季按年上升1.1%。

二零二五年本地生產總值和物價的最新預測

展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間應會進一步穩健增長。環球經濟短期內維持溫和增長，加上近期中美貿易緊張局勢緩和，以及電子相關產品持續的需求，應會支持香港的貨物出口。訪港旅遊業繼續增長及金融市場活動暢旺應為服務輸出提供進一步動力。本地方面，美國自九月起重啓減息，有利資產市場氣氛，加上消費信心逐漸恢復及營商氣氛穩步改善，這些發展應有助提振消費及投資活動。政府多項發展經濟及開拓多元化市場的措施亦會提供支持。然而，各項外部不確定性，包括來自貿易壁壘的持續影響、美國的減息步伐，以及外部需求波動可能導致貨物出口增長放緩，需要密切關注。

考慮到今年首三季3.3%的實際增長數字以及短期展望，二零二五年全年實質本地生產總值增長預測由八月覆檢時的2%至3%向上修訂至3.2%（附表二）。政府將繼續密切監察相關情況。

通脹展望方面，由於本地成本壓力仍然受控和外圍價格壓力不大，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。考慮到今年首三季的實際通脹情況，二零二五年基本和整體消費物價通脹率的預測分別由八月覆檢時的1.5%及1.8%向下修訂至1.2%及1.5%（附表二）。

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-11-14 16:00,2025-11-14 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400549.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (November 14) released the latest grading of water quality for 11 gazetted beaches that are open for swimming in November.

  Seven beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and four as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Big Wave Bay Beach
Middle Bay Beach


Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Repulse Bay Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Stanley Main Beach


Golden Beach





Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Silver Mine Bay Beach


Lido Beach
Silverstrand Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, Deep Water Bay Beachand Middle Bay Beach have been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1. Silver Mine Bay Beach has been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."

Test results of seasonal food surveillance project on hairy crabs all satisfactory,2025-11-14 15:00,2025-11-14 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400384.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (November 14) announced the test results of the seasonal food surveillance project on hairy crabs. All samples passed the tests.

The tests included veterinary drug residues, metallic contaminants, synthetic hormones, colouring matters and pesticide residues, as well as dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""From January 2025 to the end of October 2025, the CFS collected 98 hairy crab samples at the import and retail levels for chemical tests, and the test results were all satisfactory. The CFS will continue to conduct surveillance on hairy crabs to ensure food safety.""

Traders should have obtained relevant permits or written permission granted by the FEHD for selling hairy crabs, and the hairy crabs being sold must be accompanied with health certificates issued by the relevant authorities of the exporting economies. They should source hairy crabs from reliable suppliers and comply with the relevant regulatory requirements. Moreover, hairy crabs for sale must be kept in a refrigerator.

The CFS advises members of the public to observe the following Five Keys to Food Safety in purchasing, storing, preparing and cooking hairy crabs to prevent food-borne illnesses and enjoy the seasonal food safely.

Choose wisely
• Buy hairy crabs from reliable and hygienic shops with the Shell Fish (Hairy Crab) Permit or relevant written permission granted by the FEHD;
• During purchase, check whether the hairy crabs for sale are kept in a refrigerator, and buy live crabs with intact, shiny shells and without a foul smell; and
• For online purchase, buy from reliable online shops with licences or restricted food permits, and pay attention to the nature and potential risk associated with food items purchased online.

Keep clean
• Brush and wash the crab shells and claws before cooking; and
• Wash hands with running water and soap, and rub for at least 20 seconds before consumption.

Separate raw and cooked foods
• Put the raw crabs in a container with a cover and store them separately from other foods in the refrigerator to avoid cross-contamination.

Cook thoroughly
• Avoid eating raw crabs. Cook thoroughly and remove internal organs completely before consumption. Condiments such as salt, vinegar, wine and wasabi cannot kill bacteria or parasites that may be present in the crabs.

Safe temperature
• Cooked crabs should be consumed as soon as possible."

消防處與香港童軍總會攜手推動童軍成員參與「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」訓練（附圖）,2025-11-14 14:50,2025-11-14 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400167.htm,"消防處與香港童軍總會今日（十一月十四日）宣布兩項最新合作安排，以推動童軍成員積極參與「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」。香港童軍總會已在「積極公民」獎章系列下推出全新「社區應急先鋒章」，消防處亦正式認可香港童軍總會成為「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」下的首個「認可培訓機構」。

「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」旨在向市民傳授基本的防火及應急知識，提升社會應對緊急事故的能力和信心。為鼓勵更多童軍成員積極參與，消防處針對他們接受訓練的模式進行了調整，加入更多的短片及實習環節，令應急知識、施行心肺復甦法和自動心臟除顫器使用方法等技巧更易掌握，而完成訓練的童軍成員更可在制服上佩戴「社區應急先鋒章」，以展示他們在遇上事故時承諾救人自救的決心。

為了在社區更廣泛地推廣計劃，消防處積極邀請不同機構加入成為「認可培訓機構」，由消防處培訓已具備基礎應急知識的機構領袖成為社區應急先鋒導師，再由這些先鋒導師為機構成員安排「社區應急先鋒」訓練。作為首個「認可培訓機構」，香港童軍總會約120名曾參與應急準備課程的領袖，在七月至八月期間接受消防處特別提供的專業訓練，傳授教學模式及安排參加救援技巧實習課程，確保培訓質量得以傳承。至今，該批領袖已經培訓約500名童軍成員成為「社區應急先鋒」。

消防處處長楊恩健致辭時表示，消防處與香港童軍總會一直在防火宣傳、應急教育、救護知識推廣等範疇保持合作，並慶幸見證雙方的夥伴關係邁向新里程。他讚揚香港童軍總會在培養青少年公民意識與社會責任感方面貢獻良多，又感謝該會鼎力支持，預計來年會招募1 500名童軍成員參與「社區應急先鋒計劃」。

香港童軍總會香港總監黎偉生博士指出，他期望童軍成員可以透過參與「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」保護自己，並在社區中發揮守望相助精神，推動安全文化。他感謝消防處在合作推動計劃的過程中在教材設計、導師培訓和推廣方面提供專業協助，並期待是次合作能持續推動青少年培育工作，共同為香港的未來發展作出貢獻。

消防處於二○二四年推出「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」，招募市民接受防火、應急，以及施行心肺復甦法和使用自動心臟除顫器的訓練，裝備他們成為社區安全的守護者。計劃接受全港市民報名，年滿十二歲者可參加，六至十一歲的小童亦可在家長或監護人陪同下參與。參加者完成課程後會獲委任為「社區應急先鋒」，在社區推廣防火及災難應對知識，並於危難時向有需要人士伸出援手，救人自救，進一步強化香港社會整體應急能力。

楊恩健和黎偉生博士又呼籲市民在十二月七日舉行的立法會換屆選舉中履行公民責任，踴躍投票，選出賢能之士，為香港共同家園構建更美好未來。"
FSD and SAHK combine efforts to encourage Scout members to participate in FSDCER Scheme (with photos),2025-11-14 14:50,2025-11-14 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400168.htm,"The Fire Services Department (FSD) and Scout Association of Hong Kong (SAHK) today (November 14) announced two recent arrangements in their collaboration to boost participation among Scout members in the Fire Services Department Community Emergency Responder (FSDCER) Scheme. SAHK has launched the Community Emergency Responder Badge under its Active Citizenship Badge Series, while the FSD has officially recognised SAHK as the first Accredited Training Institution under the FSDCER Scheme.

The FSDCER Scheme was launched with an aim to equip members of the public with basic fire prevention and emergency knowledge, thereby enhancing their ability and confidence in responding to emergencies. To encourage keen participation by more Scout members, the FSD adjusted the training mode by adding more video viewing and practical sessions to make the emergency knowledge and techniques easier to master, such as the operation of an automatic defibrillator (AED) and administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Scout members completing the course can wear the Community Emergency Responder Badge on their uniform to show their commitment in protecting themselves and helping others during emergencies.

To step up the promotion of the FSDCER Scheme, the FSD has been actively inviting organisations from different sectors to participate as Accredited Training Institutions. Organisation leaders with basic emergency preparedness knowledge will be further equipped with FSD courses to become CER trainers for hosting CER training sessions dedicated for other members. As the first Accredited Training Institution, SAHK arranged around 120 Scout leaders, who have received emergency preparedness training before, to take part in the specialised training provided by the FSD in July and August. The specialised training, covering traditional teaching methodologies and practical sessions of rescue techniques, was arranged to guarantee the quality of training well-inherited. To date, around 500 Scout members have undergone training courses delivered by these leaders and have become FSDCERs.

The Director of Fire Services, Mr Andy Yeung, said in a speech that the FSD and SAHK are continuing to work together in areas including publicity on fire prevention, emergency preparedness education and promotion of lifesaving knowledge. He expressed his gratitude in witnessing a new milestone reached in this partnership. He also appreciated SAHK's contribution to nurturing civic awareness and social responsibilities among teenagers, and its utmost effort in supporting the FSDCER Scheme with a target to recruit 1 500 Scout members to become FSDCERs next year.

The Chief Commissioner of SAHK, Dr Wilson Lai, said he expected that Scout members taking part in the FSDCER Scheme should be prepared to protect themselves and offer assistance to those in need, as well as promote a safety culture in the community. He showed appreciation to the FSD for offering professional assistance in designing course materials, coaching trainers and arranging publicity. Dr Lai said that he hoped the co-operation can consistently contribute to nurturing teenagers for the sake of Hong Kong's development in future.

The FSD launched the FSDCER Scheme in 2024 to recruit members of the public to receive training on basic fire prevention and emergency preparedness, as well as the administration of CPR and operation of AED, thereby equipping them to help safeguard the community. The FSDCER Scheme is open for application to Hong Kong citizens aged 12 or above, while those aged 6 to 11 can join if accompanied by their parents or guardians. Participants will be appointed as a FSDCER to promote fire prevention and emergency response knowledge in the community, and to extend a helping hand to those in need during emergencies. Their ability to protect themselves and others can further strengthen the overall emergency preparedness of Hong Kong.

Mr Yeung and Dr Lai both called on the public to cast their votes in the Legislative Council General Election on December 7 to elect capable candidates to help build an even better Hong Kong."

"Local premieres of films ""Golden Boy"" and ""Someone Like Me"" financed by Film Development Fund",2025-11-14 11:33,2025-11-14 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400270.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Film Development Council (HKFDC):

The local premieres of two films which have funding support from the Film Production Financing Scheme (FPFS) under the Film Development Fund (FDF), namely ""Golden Boy"" and ""Someone Like Me"", will be held tomorrow evening (November 15) and on the evening of November 17 respectively.

   ""Golden Boy"" is directed by Joe Chan, produced by Allen Chan, written by Cheng Sing-mo and Shum Shek-yin, and stars Louis Cheung. The story is about an ex-convict, Cheung Lek, who once earned the moniker ""Golden Boy"" in the boxing ring. Cheung finds himself drifting through a listless middle age until he crosses paths with a gifted child named Fong Yuen and a washed-up coach, Chow Yiu-shan. He then goes back into the ring, embarking on a journey of redemption. The film will be theatrically released in Hong Kong on November 21.

""Someone Like Me"" is directed and written by Tam Wai-ching, produced by Stanley Kwan and Catherine Kwan, and stars Fish Liew and Carlos Chan. The film is about a woman born with cerebral palsy who meets a volunteer providing sexual services for people with disabilities, creating a story that explores the morality and courage to claim one's own narrative.

Last month, the main cast and crew of ""Someone Like Me"" participated in the 38th Tokyo International Film Festival (TIFF) as part of the delegation led by the HKFDC. The film was selected for the TIFF's ""Women's Empowerment"" section and held its world premiere during the festival. It was also selected in the ""Gala Presentation"" section of the 22nd Hong Kong Asian Film Festival. The film will be theatrically released in Hong Kong on November27.

  The FPFS has financed over 70 films since its launch in 2007. The Chairman of the HKFDC, Dr Wilfred Wong, expressed his hope that the Government will continue to support the long-term development of the local film industry through the FDF, and is looking forward to more excellent productions to be shown in theatres. He also said he hopes that more new-generation directors will keep creating films that will gain wide recognition and commercial success."
響應「世界糖尿病日」　衞生署呼籲市民透過健康生活模式預防糖尿病,2025-11-14 11:15,2025-11-14 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400250.htm,"為響應「世界糖尿病日」，衞生署今日（十一月十四日）呼籲市民實踐健康生活模式，同時通過「早預防、早發現、早治療」，以有效減低患上糖尿病及相關併發症。透過全生命周期方式，政府推廣包括健康飲食及限制攝取油、鹽和糖，多做體能活動、避免吸煙和飲酒的健康生活模式。在慢性疾病管理方面，政府積極推廣「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」），提供便捷的糖尿病及高血壓篩查服務，以及提供血脂檢查，實現「三高全覆蓋」。

衞生署衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「糖尿病是一種常見慢性疾病，特徵為血液中葡萄糖含量過高。若控制不當可引發嚴重併發症，包括心臟病、中風、腎衰竭和失明。全球每九名成年人中就有一名糖尿病患者。衞生署的二○二○至二○二二年度人口健康調查（調查）顯示，15至84歲非住院的人口中，8.5%患有糖尿病或血糖升高，和二○一四至二○一五年度的8.4%相若；調查報告顯示每三名患者中就約有一位未意識到自身患病。在二○二四年，有442宗（臨時數字）登記死亡個案與糖尿病有關，粗死亡率為按每十萬名人口計算5.9人（臨時數字）。」

為提升市民的疾病預防意識和自我健康管理能力，基層醫療署透過各地區康健中心／地區康健站（統稱為康健中心）和家庭醫生積極推廣「健康人生計劃」。政府在二○二三年推出為期三年的「慢病共治計劃」，資助45歲或以上未曾確診患有高血壓或糖尿病的香港居民，配對家庭醫生並於私營醫療市場接受糖尿病及高血壓篩查，並於今年三月擴展至提供血脂檢查。經篩查後被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的參加者可進入治療階段，在政府資助下由自行選擇的家庭醫生繼續診治，以及按健康狀況獲處方藥物，接受專屬護士診所和專職醫療服務。今年十月十五日，已有超過16萬名市民參加了「慢病共治計劃」，約100 400人（即約六成）已完成篩查。其中約40 500人（約四成）已進入治療階段，當中包括被診斷為血糖偏高（即指糖化血紅素6.0-6.4%或空腹血糖6.1-6.9 mmol/L水平），或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的參加者。在發展以家庭醫學服務模式聚焦照顧弱勢社群的策略下，基層醫療署已由今年三月底起分階段擴展「慢病共治計劃」至醫院管理局轄下指定家庭醫學診所及家庭醫學綜合中心，為弱勢社群提供高血壓、高血糖和高血脂篩查，以及慢性疾病管理的服務。有關「慢病共治計劃」詳情，可瀏覽專題網站。

糖尿病主要分為一型、二型和妊娠期糖尿病，其中以二型糖尿病最為常見，約佔所有糖尿病個案的95%，而超重及肥胖、缺乏體能活動和遺傳為患上二型糖尿病的關鍵因素。

徐樂堅醫生說：「無論遺傳風險因素如何，改變生活模式是預防二型糖尿病或延後發病的最佳方法。市民應保持健康體重、均衡飲食並限制糖份和飽和脂肪的攝取、避免飲酒或吸煙。此外，每星期應進行最少150至300分鐘中等強度的帶氧體能活動或同等時間和強度的體能活動；步行亦是其中一項體能活動，可預防多種慢性病和減低患上二型糖尿病的風險。」

為提升市民預防糖尿病和其他非傳染病的意識，政府會繼續透過舉辦健康推廣活動，以提升市民的健康素養，加強公眾了解健康生活的重要性，協助高風險人士定期測量血糖，以及與各政府部門及社區夥伴合作，建設健康的生活環境。

DH appeals to public to adopt healthy lifestyles to prevent diabetes in support of World Diabetes Day,2025-11-14 11:15,2025-11-14 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111400252.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (November 14) urged members of the public to adopt healthy lifestyles in support ofWorld Diabetes Day. The risk of developing diabetes mellitus(diabetes) and related complications can be effectively reduced through ""early prevention, early detection and early treatment"". The Government promotes a healthy lifestyle encompassing healthy eating, reducing fat, salt and sugar intake, being physically active, and refraining from smoking and alcohol consumption through a life-course approach. The Government is actively promoting the Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme to manage chronic diseases. The CDCC Pilot Scheme offers convenient screening services for diabetes and hypertension, as well as blood lipid testing, to achieve full coverage of the ""three highs"".

  ""Diabetes is a common chronic condition marked by high levels of glucose in the blood, and improper diabetic control may result in serious complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure and blindness. Globally, one in nine adults has diabetes. In Hong Kong, the Population Health Survey 2020-22 conducted by the DH observed that 8.5 per cent of non-institutionalised persons aged 15 to 84 had diabetes or raised blood glucose, which is at a level similar to the 8.4 per cent recorded in 2014-15. The Survey also showed that approximately one in every three persons with diabetes is not aware that he/she is living with the condition. In 2024, there were 442 (provisional figure) registered deaths attributed to diabetes with a crude death rate of 5.9 per 100 000 population (provisional figure),"" said the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Edwin Tsui.

The Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) promotes the Life Course Preventive Care Plan through District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) and family doctors, in order to enhance public awareness of self-health management and disease prevention. The Government launched the three-year CDCC Pilot Scheme in 2023, subsidising Hong Kong residents aged 45 and above with no known medical history of diabetes or hypertension to be paired with family doctors for diabetes and hypertension screening services in the private healthcare market. In March this year, the CDCC Pilot Scheme was expanded to cover blood lipid testing. Participants diagnosed with prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidaemia after screening can proceed to the treatment phase and will be subsidised by the Government to continue their treatment with a family doctor of their choice and, subject to their health conditions, will be provided with prescribed medication, a dedicated nurse clinic and allied health services. As of October 15 this year, over 160 000 members of the public have enrolled in the Scheme. Approximately 100 400 participants (i.e. about 60 per cent) have completed the screenings, and around 40 500 participants (i.e. about 40 per cent) have proceeded to the treatment phase, including participants who have been diagnosed with prediabetes (i.e. blood glucose level ranging from 6.0 to 6.4 per cent for glycated haemoglobin or a fasting plasma glucose level of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L.), diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidaemia. In developing the strategy to focus on caring for the underprivileged group through a Family Medicine service model, the PHC Commission has been expanding the CDCC Pilot Scheme to designated Hospital Authority Family Medicine Clinics and Family Medicine Integrated Centres in phases since end-March this year, providing underprivileged groups with hypertension, high blood glucose and hyperlipidaemia screenings, as well as chronic disease management services. More details of the CDCC Pilot Scheme can be found on the dedicated website.

Among the main types of diabetes (type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes), type 2 diabetes is the most common form, which makes up more than 95 per cent of all diabetes cases. Key factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight or obese, not getting enough exercise and genetics.

  ""Regardless of genetic risk, lifestyle changes are the best way to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Members of the public are urged to reach and keep a healthy body weight, eat a healthy diet and limit sugar and saturated fat intake, refrain from alcohol drinking, and avoid smoking. Moreover, the public should stay physically active with at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent amount and intensity of physical activity throughout the week. Walking as a way of conducting physical activity can also guard against various chronic diseases and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes,"" said Dr Tsui.

To raise public awareness of the prevention of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases, the Government will continue organising health promotional campaigns to enhance people's health literacy about the importance of healthy living, enabling persons at risk to have regular measurements of blood glucose. The Government will also work in close partnership with community partners to foster a health-enhancing environment.

Additional designated driving school and driving test centre opens,2025-11-14 10:00,2025-11-14 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/14/P2025111300618.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (November 14) that 69 Shan Ha Road, Yuen Long, has been designated as a driving school in accordance with section 88K(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374).

  The designated driving school officially commenced operation today. The TD will also set up a driving test centre in the school for conducting driving tests. Including this school, there are now five government-designated driving schools and driving test centres in Hong Kong, located in Sha Tin, Ap Lei Chau, Yuen Long and Kwun Tong.

  A spokesman for the TD said that the Government attaches great importance to the management of driving schools and the provision of driving test services, striving to maintain an effective driver training and testing system for the promotion of road safety. The TD has issued a Code of Practice for regulating the operation of the driving schools, including training routes, on-street training hours and the number of training vehicles. With road safety being the primary objective, the TD will closely monitor the operation of driving schools and traffic conditions in their vicinities and review their operational arrangements when necessary to ensure compliance with the Code of Practice.

  The Government has long adopted a two-pronged approach in respect of driver training. On one hand, off-street driver training is promoted through the establishment of driving schools. On the other hand, the Government maintains a sufficient supply of private driving instructors for on-street driver training. The driving school's operator, after receiving approval from the Town Planning Board, applied to the TD for the operation of a designated driving school, providing driver training services for private cars, light goods vehicles and motorcycles. After a careful review of all conditions, including the availability of necessary facilities for driver training and testing, the TD approved the application. The Government will consider and approve applications from operators on a case-by-case basis, provided that they can offer sites that meet the requirements, including the permitted land use and space for accommodating basic driver training and testing facilities for a driving school.

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's website for details of designated driving schools."

文化體育及旅遊局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-13 21:55,2025-11-13 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/13/P2025111300852.htm,"​以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（十一月十三日）晚上在深圳大運中心游泳館觀賞第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）賽事後會見傳媒的談話內容：

文化體育及旅遊局局長：非常開心，今晚詩蓓是由頭帶到尾，有餘未盡，所以她拿這面金牌，我們所有人都很開心。這是香港游泳隊在全運會歷來第一面金牌，連同早前貝俊龍在帆船的金牌，也是帆船隊第一面全運會金牌，加上（李）思穎（在公路自行車）的衞冕，港隊今屆直至現在已經有三金了。加上網球青年組我們有一面銅牌，現在有三金一銅，在金牌方面已經打破了歷屆紀錄，很值得為我們的運動員喝采和繼續支持他們。

大家也看到我們所有隊伍都出盡全力，今日我也觀看了男子22歲以下籃球比賽，雖然輸了，但打得非常好。

另外，男子（七人制）橄欖球（比賽）應該還有十分鐘左右，就會對江蘇，爭入明日的決賽，我們對他們充滿信心。

記者：今次是否第一次看何詩蓓比賽？私底下有否為她加油？你覺得她剛才表現怎樣？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：對，這是我第一次。平日在電視看直播，感覺200米好像游很久，因為播着近鏡，但原來現場觀看很快便游完，所以一直很緊張。但是因為詩蓓由頭帶到尾，我們就安心一點。我當然私下有支持（何詩蓓），公開也有支持。詩蓓還有三個項目，希望她在這個強項拿到金牌，讓她在往後的項目也繼續報捷。

記者：剛剛看到局長跟一些運動員見面，有甚麼交流？談過甚麼？有甚麼鼓勵說話？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：剛才跟泳隊運動員見面，很多其實還是中學生，剛剛在世青（世界青年游泳錦標賽）也拿了很多獎牌回來。我固然很開心見到大師姐詩蓓有這麼好的成績，同時也很開心我們有梯隊了，下面的青少年運動員也開始冒起，香港泳隊的發展將會越來越好。

記者：手球方面，早前你說過答應了他們會提供一些場地支援，是永久場地還是永久的資助？是否因為他們有成績，還是你覺得應該要給他們多點資助？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：永久（場地），大家都知道在香港來說是不容易的，但我們要解決的是燃眉之急，所以即使我現在說興建一個永久場地，也未必立刻幫助到手球隊，所以我們想的辦法會是即時幫到他們的一些辦法。我已經跟同事、體育專員和康文署（康樂及文化事務署）開會，希望很快有好消息。我們也要和（中國香港）手球總會談談，這是不是他們需要的東西，但是已經有進展了。

至於是否好成績就會幫助多一些，我想這是有一定關係的。近年我們對體育投入這麼多，運動員交出好成績，我們的投入再多一點，這也很自然的事。但是手球隊的的確確以業餘的姿態，能夠挑戰全國的職業強隊，這一方面令我們很振奮和很值得繼續支持他們。

記者：（國際奧委會終身名譽主席）巴赫提到（粵港澳）大灣區有申辦奧運會的一切條件，這是未來會考慮的發展方向嗎？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：巴赫先生對整個（粵港澳）大灣區的評價這麼高，我們很榮幸和很開心。正如我們早前也回答過大家的問題，申辦奧運的的確確不只是香港的事，也不是整個（粵港澳）大灣區的事，而是一個國家的行為。現階段我們繼續辦好全運會和殘特奧會（全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會）。當然總結經驗後，大家會知道，我們有過這次粵港澳大灣區通力合作舉辦一屆精彩的全運會，簡約、安全、精彩（的全運會），往後其實沒有事是不可能的。謝謝大家。"
