康文署「香港藝術家」系列十一月呈獻張穎琳女高音演唱會（附圖）,2025-10-13 11:00,2025-10-13 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101000316.htm,"康樂及文化事務署（康文署）「香港藝術家」系列十一月呈獻張穎琳女高音演唱會。這位女高音歌唱家將在鋼琴家張力安的伴奏下，以其廣闊的音域和雋永的音色獻唱多首經典歌劇詠嘆調和現代作品，引領觀眾走進交織浪漫、童話、詩意和奇幻氛圍的音樂世界。

是次演唱會中，張穎琳除會獻唱受歡迎的德語作品，包括舒伯特的《就讓我如此呈現》和貝爾格的《七首早期歌曲》外，亦會帶來多首有關童話故事的歌曲，其中三首為歌劇的詠嘆調，包括選自馬斯奈《仙履奇緣》中神仙教母出場時所唱的〈好孩子〉、多夫《中了魔法的豬》中由女巫之女阿德萊德被安排與被下咒變為豬的王子成婚時所唱的〈這是我的婚禮〉和堪柏定克《糖果屋》中小兄妹二人發現糖果屋前由妹妹葛蕾桃所唱的〈我在哪裡〉。

演出亦涵蓋多首女作曲家的藝術作品：維耶的《林中的睡美人》乃一首「華爾滋歌曲」，描繪童話中睡公主被王子的歌聲喚醒；博尼斯的《三首歌曲》和萊曼的《五首情歌小品》則捕捉愛情的不同階段和感覺。部分選唱的法語歌曲則富有異國情調，如德布西的《中國詩歌迴旋曲》和拉威爾的《五首希臘民謠》。最後以選自奧芬巴赫《荷夫曼的故事》歌劇中詩人荷夫曼的初戀奧林匹克（實為機械人）所唱的花腔詠嘆調〈玩偶之歌〉作結，為全晚的演出添上奇幻的戲劇魅力。

"LCSD's ""Hong Kong Artists"" Series to present vocal recital by soprano Viola Cheung in November (with photos)",2025-10-13 11:00,2025-10-13 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101000319.htm,"The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD)'s ""Hong Kong Artists"" Series will stage a vocal recital by soprano Viola Cheung in November. Accompanied by pianist Leona Cheung, the soprano will showcase her extended vocal range and resonant timbre through a selection of classical opera arias and contemporary music pieces, guiding audiences into a musical world interwoven with romance, fairy-tale enchantment, poetic subtlety and whimsical fantasy.

In this concert, Viola Cheung will not only perform beloved lieder, including Schubert's ""So lasst mich scheinen, bis ich werde"" and Berg's ""Sieben frühe Lieder"", but will also present a selection of songs inspired by fairy tales. Among these are three opera arias: ""Ah! Douce Enfant"" from Massenet's ""Cendrillon"", which marks the entrance of the Fairy Godmother; ""It's my Wedding"" from Dove's ""The Enchanted Pig"", where Adelaide, the witch's daughter, finds herself arranged to marry a prince who has been cursed into a pig; and ""Wo ich bin"" from Humperdinck's ""Hansel and Gretel"", sung by Gretel just before the siblings discover the enchanted gingerbread house.

  The performance will also encompass several art songs by female composers: Vieu's ""La Belle au bois dormant"" is a ""sung waltz"" depicting the fairy-tale Sleeping Beauty awakened by the Prince's melody, while Bonis' ""Trois Melodies"" and Lehmann's ""Five Little Love Songs"" capture different facets and sentiments of love. A selection of songs in French will also add exotic flavours to the programme, such as Debussy's ""Rondel Chinois"" and Ravel's ""Cinq Mélodies Populaires Grecques"". The evening will conclude with the coloratura aria ""Doll Song"" from Offenbach's opera ""Tales of Hoffmann"" - sung by the mechanical doll Olympia, the poet Hoffmann's first love - adding a final touch of operatic fantasy that brings the concert to a captivating close.

  Viola Cheung was awarded the scholarship of Best Student in Concentrated Studies by Hong Kong Baptist University and elected as one of the ""Young Music Makers"" by Radio Television Hong Kong in 2015. She continued her music studies in the Netherlands and obtained Master's Degrees from both the Royal Conservatoire of The Hague and the Codarts Rotterdam. She has been invited to perform different roles in operas around the world in recent years after her successful debut as Königin der Nacht in Mozart's ""Die Zauberflöte"" in 2017, and has featured in more than 30 premieres of new compositions.

  The ""Hong Kong Artists"" Series: Vocal Recital by Viola Cheung will be staged at 8pm on November 13 (Thursday) at the Theatre of Hong Kong City Hall. Tickets priced at $200 and $240 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288.

DH starts accepting applications for clinic licences and requests for letters of exemption for small practice clinics,2025-10-13 09:00,2025-10-13 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/13/P2025101000315.htm,"The regulatory regime for clinics and small practice clinics (SPCs) under the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance (Cap. 633) came into effect today (October 13). The Department of Health (DH) started accepting applications for clinic licences (see annex) and requests for letters of exemption for SPCs on the same day.

The Ordinance regulates premises where registered medical practitioners and/or registered dentists practise. Operators of clinics must obtain a relevant licence, while operators of SPCs may request a letter of exemption instead to continue operation. Licensees must at all times comply with the Ordinance, licence conditions and the Code of Practice for Clinics issued by the Director of Health (DoH).

Application details
--------------------

For clinics already in operation on or before November 30, 2018 (i.e. the gazettal date for the enactment of the Ordinance), their operators may submit applications for clinic licences from today to April 13, 2026 (both dates inclusive). As a transitional arrangement, depending on the circumstances, the DH may issue a provisional licence which allows these clinics to continue their operation before a full licence is issued. This allows operators to make the necessary modifications to their clinics to comply with licensing requirements, such as modification of the accommodation layout. A provisional licence will expire on the date specified by the Secretary for Health for the expiry of provisions pertaining toprovisional licences; upon issuance of a full licence to the licensee; or upon withdrawal or rejection of the full licence application.

For clinics that commenced operation after November 30, 2018, including new establishments or those relocated to new premises, their operators must apply directly for a full licence.

For SPCs (i.e. no more than five registered medical practitioners and/or registered dentists that meet specific conditions under the Ordinance), their operators may submit a request for a letter of exemption to the DoH starting from today for continued operation without obtaining a licence.

Starting today, operators of all clinics and SPCs can apply for clinic licences or request for letters of exemption for SPCs through the DH's ""e-Licensing"" System. They can submit their digital signatures via the ""iAM Smart+"" app to complete the entire application process electronically. Through the system, applicants can check the status of application in real time, and receive electronic licences or letters of exemption once their applications are approved.

DH provides the industry with full support in making applications
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure that the industry has a comprehensive understanding of the requirements of the Ordinance, the DH has explained the legal requirements and application procedures to stakeholders in the healthcare sector through various channels, including conducting a number of online and offline briefing sessions to address industry enquiries. The DH will continue to organise monthly online briefing sessions from November this year to April next year to explain relevant requirements to stakeholders, including clinic and SPC operators and doctors.

​本港錄得今年首宗兒童感染流感的死亡個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-10-12 18:45,2025-10-12 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/12/P2025101200497.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）日前公布一宗兒童感染乙型流感的嚴重個案，13歲患者今日（十月十二日）情況轉差，不幸病逝。中心再次呼籲學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港自去年六月以來，首次有兒童因感染季節性流感而死亡。本港正值夏季流感季節，學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案自九月起大幅上升。截至十月十日，九月開學後涉及學校的爆發個案共有337宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（35宗）、小學（182宗）及中學（120宗）。計及上述個案，中心由開學至今錄得九宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重和一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎3至17歲，其中八人過往的健康狀況良好。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃已經展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。今年所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生續說：「除了香港，鄰近地區的季節性流感活躍程度亦上升，日本已宣布進入流感季節，較去年早。流感病毒會不斷變異，因此，流感疫苗亦要每年更新。即使上一季度曾接種季節性流感疫苗，市民仍然要接種新一季度最新的疫苗，方可在未來一年的流感季節得到保護。對高危人士而言，流感可引致嚴重疾病，而健康人士亦會受影響。接種流感疫苗是其中一種最有效預防季節性流感及其併發症的方法，亦可減低因流感而入院留醫和死亡的個案。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。」

他提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as Hong Kong records its first fatal case of paediatric influenza infection this year,2025-10-12 18:45,2025-10-12 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/12/P2025101200512.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health recently announced a case of severe paediatric influenza B infection. The 13-year-old patient's condition deteriorated today (October 12) and unfortunately passed away. The CHP reiterated its appeal to schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

""This is the first fatal case of paediatric influenza infection in Hong Kong since June last year. Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illness outbreaks in schools since September. As of October 10, 337 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 35 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 182 cases in primary schools and 120 cases in secondary schools. Including the above case, nine severe and one fatal paediatric influenza cases involving children aged 3 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year. Eight of them had good past health,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The 2025/26 SIV Programmes have commenced, offering free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. This year, all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools are allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities.

  ""Seasonal influenza activity is also rising in neighbouring regions beyond Hong Kong. Japan has declared the onset of its influenza season, which is earlier than last year. As influenza viruses constantly mutate, the influenza vaccine must be updated annually. Even if individuals received the SIV last season, they should still get the latest vaccine for the new season to ensure protection against the current strain of influenza. Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even in healthy persons. SIV is one of the most effective ways of preventing seasonal influenza and its complications, as well as reducing influenza-related hospitalisation and death. The SIV is recommended for all persons aged six months or above, except those with known contraindications. Those at higher risk of contracting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive the SIV as soon as possible."" Dr Tsui added.

Dr Tsui reminded the public that, if they develop a fever and respiratory symptoms, especially among children, elderly and those with chronic conditions, they should seek medical attention promptly for early treatment. High-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."

最新個案資料

個案涉及一名65歲女子，住所位於油尖旺區。初步調查顯示，她於十月五日至十日到訪廣東省廣州市，十月十日出現關節痛，翌日出現發燒及皮疹，同日到明愛醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。醫院管理局的化驗結果顯示，她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。病人沒有家居接觸者。

由於病人於潛伏期身處廣東省，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得32宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：

在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

  The case involves a 65-year-old female living in Yau Tsim Mong District. Preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Guangzhou in Guangdong between October 5 and 10. She developed joint pain on October 10, and a fever and rash on the following day. She then sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on October 11. She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing by the Hospital Authority. She has no household contact.

  Since the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 32 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

Public urged to guard against fake messages on Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles and Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles,2025-10-12 14:50,2025-10-12 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/12/P2025101200440.htm,"A spokesman for the Transport Department today (October 12) reminded members of the public to guard against and avoid being misled by recent fake messages in social media and messaging groups purported to be extension of the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles (NBT) to other boundary control points (BCPs) and scheme details of the future Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles (SBT). The incident will be referred to the Police for follow-up.

The spokesman clarified that NBT is currently applicable to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) only, but not other BCPs. Private cars will not be approved concurrently for both NBT and the Shenzhen Bay Ad Hoc Quotas for Cross Boundary Private Cars. The NBT arrangements of travelling without the need for advance bookings, which took effect from September 2025, only cover Tuesdays and Wednesdays (except specified dates).

Of note, the Shenzhen Bay Ad Hoc Quotas for Cross Boundary Private Cars and NBT are two different schemes. Eligible private car owners who wish to enter Guangdong under the Shenzhen Bay Ad Hoc Quotas for Cross Boundary Private Cars should submit an application for each travel. Upon approval, their private cars can then enter Guangdong via Shenzhen Bay Port within the five-day quota validity period and stay for not more than seven days. They must return to Hong Kong via Shenzhen Bay Port.

As for SBT, the Government will update the Legislative Council Panel on Transport on October 17.

The spokesman stressed that implementation details of cross-boundary driving schemes and operational arrangements of BCPs are serious issues which must be considered holistically. If there are new arrangements of any cross-boundary driving schemes, the Government will issue press releases as official announcements for the public's information. Citizens should heighten vigilance and verify messages to avoid deception or disruption to their travel plans.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to enhance implementation arrangements of NBT and press ahead with SBT to facilitate efficient cross-boundary travel and make better use of the carrying capacity of the HZMB further, thereby promoting the integrated development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area."
市民勿誤信「港車北上」和「粵車南下」虛假信息,2025-10-12 14:17,2025-10-12 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/12/P2025101200425.htm,"運輸署發言人今日（十月十二日）提醒市民，切勿誤信社交媒體和通訊群組近日聲稱「港車北上」擴展至其他口岸，以及未來「粵車南下」計劃的不實信息，免被誤導。事件將轉交警方跟進。

發言人澄清，現時「港車北上」只適用於港珠澳大橋，不包括其他口岸。私家車不可同時獲批「港車北上」及「深圳灣過境私家車一次性特別配額」。今年九月起實施的「港車北上」無須預約即可出行的安排，只涵蓋星期二和三（指定日子除外）。

申請人需注意，「深圳灣過境私家車一次性特別配額」與「港車北上」是兩項不同的計劃。合資格私家車車主如欲經「深圳灣過境私家車一次性特別配額」到粵，每次出行均須申請，在配額五天的有效期內經深圳灣口岸到粵一次，逗留最多七天，並必須經深圳灣口岸回港。

至於「粵車南下」，政府將於十月十七日向立法會交通事務委員會作最新匯報。

發言人重申，跨境駕駛計劃實施詳情和口岸運作安排等是嚴肅課題，須通盤考慮。任何跨境駕駛計劃如有新安排，政府會發出新聞公報。市民應以官方公布為準，小心求證，慎防受騙，影響出行計劃。

特區政府會持續優化「港車北上」和推進「粵車南下」的實施安排，推動便捷的跨境通行，進一步善用港珠澳大橋的承載力，促進粵港澳大灣區融合發展。"
