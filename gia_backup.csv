Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-11 17:45,2025-10-11 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/11/P2025101100576.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 11), two new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

 The first case involves a 69-year-old female living in Kwun Tong District. Preliminary investigations revealed that she visited Zhongshan in Guangdong alone between September 28 and October 8. She developed a fever and joint pain on October 10 and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital on the same day. She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the Chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. She has no household contacts.

âThe other case involves a51-year-old male living in Wan Chai District. Preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Jieyang and Shantou in Guangdong between October 4 and 7. He developed a fever on October 8, joint paint on October 9, and rash on October 10. He sought medical attention at an out-patient clinic of a private hospital on the same day, and he was subsequently admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. His blood sample tested positive for the Chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. He is now in stable condition.

 âFour people who accompanied the patient to Jieyang and Shantou and another household contact of his (who did not travel with him) are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the two patients stayed in Guangdong Province during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 31 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-11 17:45,2025-10-11 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/11/P2025101100572.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月十一日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

首宗個案涉及一名69歲女子，住所位於觀塘區。初步調查顯示，她於九月二十八日至十月八日獨自到訪廣東省中山市。她於十月十日出現發燒及關節痛，同日到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。病人沒有家居接觸者。

另一宗個案涉及一名51歲男子，住所位於灣仔區。初步調查顯示，他於十月四日至七日到訪廣東省揭陽市和汕頭市。他於十月八日出現發燒，十月九日出現關節痛，並於十月十日出現皮疹，同日到私家醫院門診求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。

與病人同行到揭陽市和汕頭市的四名人士，及病人的另一名家居接觸者（沒有同行外遊），現時均沒有出現病徵，全部正接受醫學監察。

由於上述兩名病人於潛伏期身處廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得31宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

律政司副司長在香江智滙「國安教育理論與實踐」論壇致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-11 17:29,2025-10-11 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/11/P2025101100555.htm,"以下是律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（十月十一日）在香江智滙「國安教育理論與實踐」論壇致辭：

尊敬的張副部長（中聯辦研究部副部長張軍）、吳醫生（香江智滙主席吳歷山）、顧教授（香江智滙秘書長顧敏康教授）、各位嘉賓：

大家好。多謝主辦單位今日的邀請，讓我有機會和大家分享有關國家安全教育實踐的經驗和體會。

國家安全教育的目的其實是非常簡單清楚，就是要提高大家的國家安全意識，增強防範和抵禦安全風險的能力，同時培養國民身份認同。這個目的非常清楚簡單，但要真正落實到位便需要我們不斷努力和改進。

我自己本身是律師出身，一個成功的律師最重要的是懂得和客戶溝通，溝通的藝術很重要。同一番法律上的道理，不同的表達方式會產生完全不同的效果。舉個例子，在我執業的生涯過程當中，我認識的一位大律師朋友，法律造詣非常高，但是每次當他要跟一個即將上庭面對審訊的客戶開會時，無論有關罪名輕重，他開頭的時候都會跟客戶說案情非常不樂觀，叫客戶要做足心理準備。此時，通常坐在我旁邊的客人就會跟我要求更換律師。」。所以，我們溝通的技巧是非常重要。

當然，在國安教育上當我們的對象是知識分子或專業人士的時候，我們會選擇用一些比較專業和學術的方式討論和交流。然而，若我們的對象是普羅市民大眾或青年學生的時候，我們就要懂得調較我們的方式，避免說教和複雜深奧的理論，否則受眾只會感到沉悶，收起耳朵，甚至在課堂上「靈魂出竅」，留低軀殼在座位上。所以，國安教育要有效果，我們就要多動腦筋，嘗試多找一些「有畫面」的事例和故事，令受眾「有反應、有感覺」。

近年我們大家都知道世界紛亂，如果你有留意國際新聞的話，其實在世界各地有關國家安全的素材，可以說是俯拾皆是，只是我們平時有沒有留意而已。

所以今天我打算和大家分享兩個大家非常熟悉的童話故事。

第一個是魔鏡，我想大家小時候都聽過「魔鏡魔鏡誰最漂亮」。要正確認識世界便想起魔鏡。魔鏡是《白雪公主》裏壞皇后擁有的，這一面鏡只說真話，不會說謊。壞皇后每日都會向問魔鏡「世界上誰最漂亮」。由於魔鏡不會說謊，因此皇后十分高興魔鏡經常說她最漂亮。直到有一日，當白雪公主成長後比皇后漂亮，魔鏡的答案改變了，更讓皇后對白雪公主動了殺機。

剛才我說過，在國安教育上，我們要避免教授抽象和空泛的概念，要多用魔鏡帶大家去看清楚世界發生事情的真相為何。舉個例子，戰後多年以來，我想大家知道美國自詡為「世界文明的燈塔」，標榜是世界民主、人權和法治的唯一標準。

但是，你用這塊鏡去看一看，其實當今世界有兩場焦點戰爭，如果大家有留意國際新聞都會知道的，一個就是在加沙的以巴衝突，另外一個就是俄羅斯烏克蘭之間的俄烏戰爭。這兩場現今世界的焦點戰爭，其實都離不開美國的身影，包括武器和情報的供應以及政治上的偏袒和保護。為何會這樣說呢？在今年聯合國安理會（聯合國安全理事會）曾多次就要求在加沙立即無條件實現永久停火和釋放人質的決議草案表決，但是每一次的結果就是大家贊成，唯獨只有美國否決而不能通過。

我們再看看今年八月，美國國務院又宣布對國際刑事法院兩名法官和兩名副檢察長實施制裁。大家應該知道制裁這兩個字在美國現在是家常便飯，為何這次連國際法院的法官和檢察長都會制裁呢？美國給的理由是他們在未徵得美國和以色列同意下，針對美以兩國公民的調查、拘留和起訴，包括就加沙戰爭對以色列總理內塔尼亞胡和前國防部長加蘭特發出逮捕令。正如國際刑事法院發表的譴責聲明所言，美方制裁措施是公然打擊國際刑事法院獨立性。所以在魔鏡之下，一些國家和政治人物的本性無所遁形，表露無遺。

第二個故事是《國王的新衣》。這個故事我想大家都耳熟能詳，我希望大家能夠勇敢去戳破謊言。《國王的新衣》故事很簡單，國王明明沒有穿上衣服出巡，但卻沒有人敢說出真話，直到天真的小孩揭露謊言，讓國王成為笑柄。

我們回到現實，近年來，一些美西方國家紛紛收緊各自的國安法律、擴大限制範圍、甚至你會留意到有些國家定性中國為敵人，視任何與中國的聯繫為國安威脅。一些西方政府及政客，一方面不斷加碼本身國安要求，義正辭嚴地基於實際需要，所以要訂立一些更嚴厲的國家安全法律，去保護自己的國家；另一方面卻對香港特區的國家安全法律不斷醜化，這充斥著大家常說的雙重標準。當我們就二十三條立法的時候，這是我們香港特區第一步維護國家安全的本地法律，但他們就說這是香港自由的「淪陷」。所以大家看到這個「雙重標準」，這些國家大話連篇，但是在國際社會上卻沒有人敢主持公道去直斥其非。

其實，國家安全法律就好比國家門口的防盜門，保護我們國家的安全。如果用一句小朋友都聽得懂的說話回應這些西方國家的無理指控，我就會說，你想想有哪些人，如果我在自己家門口安裝道防盜門，為甚麼有人會這麼大反應去批評，甚至要求我們撤回呢？。如果有人不想我安裝防盜門，他只會是一些小偷，或者是一些強盜，才會這麼在意我家到底安裝多少道防盜門，安裝甚麼防盜門，所以誰是強盜，誰是小偷，我相信大家心裏有數。

剛才我所說兩個童話故事的現實版，是想告訴大家，其實在現今世界的確是危機處處，國家安全的風險亦的確是真實存在，以前我們見到的是披着羊皮的豺狼，而今日的國際社會裏面，我們見到這些豺狼連羊皮都放下，毫不掩飾狼子的野心，如果在這樣的環境之下，我們仍然對我們自己的安全，還抱着一種僥倖，又或者是現在很多年青人所說的「躺平」心態的話，如果將來我們遇到甚麼不幸的時候，將會是咎由自取。

我這個說書人今天先說到這裏，日後有機會再和大家講其他故事。多謝大家。"

Hong Kong Customs detects drug trafficking case involving incoming passenger at airport (with photo),2025-10-11 15:00,2025-10-11 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/11/P2025101100407.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected a drug trafficking case involving an incoming passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (October 10) and seized about 3.7 kilograms of suspected methamphetamine with an estimated market value of about $1.2 million.

A 42-year-old female passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Johannesburg, South Africa via Dubai, United Arab Emirates yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected methamphetamine in her check-in baggage. The woman was subsequently arrested.

After an investigation, the arrested woman has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug and the case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on October 13.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

The event marked the 100-day countdown to the commencement of the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance on January 20 next year, with an aim to enhance public awareness of the Ordinance and promote child protection among members of the public and ethnic minority communities.

The Secretary for Labour and Welfare and Vice-chairperson of the CoC, Mr Chris Sun, together with the ex-officio members of the CoC; the Commissioner of Police, Mr Joe Chow; the Director of Social Welfare, Mr Edward To; and the Chairman of the Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong, Mr Saeed Uddin, officiated at the opening ceremony.

In his opening remarks, Mr Sun said that the Government has launched the Child Protection Campaign to dovetail with the commencement of the Ordinance and to enhance the understanding of the mandatory reporting regime among specified professionals and members of the public. The event further strengthened the collaboration between the Government and ethnic minority communities to jointly create a safe and inclusive environment for the growth of children.

Mr Uddin indicated that child protection is not only a professional responsibility but also a moral and communal obligation. He reaffirmed that the ethnic minority community is fully committed to supporting and promoting the establishment of a safe and respectful environment for children. Mr Chow pointed out that the Police have always been committed to fostering community engagement with ethnic minority groups and have been promoting the new legislation through various channels and stakeholders. He appealed to members of the public to promptly report any suspected child abuse cases to safeguard the safety and well-being of children. Mr To highlighted that the Social Welfare Department has been working closely with other government departments and non-governmental organisations to safeguard the well-being of children. Through the cross-sectoral support and collaborative efforts of professionals from the social welfare, education and healthcare sectors, problems can be identified and intervened upon at an early stage, providing families in need with appropriate assistance.

The officiating guests, accompanied by the Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan; the Convenor of the Working Group on Child Protection of the CoC, Ms Kathy Chung; and Vice-convenors Dr Rizwan Ullah and Ms Donna Wong; the Convenor of the Working Group on Promotion and Public Engagement of the CoC, Mr Gary Wong; and the Vice-convenor, Ms Joyce Lee, officiated at the kick-off ceremony to mark the milestone of the 100-day countdown to the commencement of the Ordinance in January next year.

The event featured different interactive game booths for ethnic minorities and local families to participate in. These booth games highlighted the content of the Ordinance and the message of child protection, facilitating parents and carers in understanding how the mandatory reporting regime could protect children from abuse, thereby enhancing public awareness of the Ordinance. Children's health check stations were also set up at the event, encouraging parents and carers to pay closer attention to children's health and development, thereby promoting a healthy lifestyle.

This event was one of the stakeholder engagement events of the CoC under the theme of racial harmony for child protection. Through community participation, it widely disseminated the message of child protection to members of the public. The CoC will continue to promote the work on child protection through various publicity initiatives and activities and collaborate with all sectors of society to safeguard the well-being of children."

The public will be able to purchase agricultural products at the farm and take part in modernised farming experiential activities provided by the farm.

Officiating at the opening ceremony, the Permanent Secretary for Environment and Ecology (Food), Ms Irene Young, said that the development of urban farming is one of the strategies set out in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's Blueprint for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and Fisheries. Urban farms provide fresh, low carbon and quality agricultural products with ""harvest-to-sale"", and will organise agriculture related educational activities, enabling the coexistence of agriculture and urban development and enhancing the quality and livability of urban life.

The Government will continue to adopt a multi-pronged approach to promote urban farming, including introducing urban farming elements into the planning stage of the Northern Metropolis, providing technical and financial assistance to the industry, and setting up modernised hydroponic farms-cum-stalls on rooftops of the Tin Shui Wai Public Market and the Kwu Tung North New Development Area Public Market slated for completion in the coming years.

公務員事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容,2025-10-11 14:07,2025-10-11 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/11/P2025101100412.htm,"以下是公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵今日（十月十一日）上午出席電台節目後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：首先想請問剛才在節目提到會就公務員敍用委員會方面的調查範圍訂立一個附屬法例，可否向我們講講，例如會初步有甚麼傾向，覺得這個附屬法例要如何釐定、如何仔細可以具體訂立調查的法例讓大家都明白？第二點，剛才也提到，日後如果有公務員敍用委員會負責調查的話，有沒有一些情況可能如以前一樣，要成立獨立委員會進行調查，如何去分野？

公務員事務局局長：首先，我們將來要訂立的附屬法例，其實我們正在研究，不過因為公務員敍用委員會是可以邀請沒有涉及該調查事件的公務員提供協助，亦因為公務員敍用委員會做調查是由局長得到司長同意後邀請進行的，所以行政機關其實是要盡量去配合。如果行政機關不配合的話，本身已經是一個不當行為。所以在調查程序，例如文件索取等，因為我們已經有制度的保障，未必需要着墨太多，但我們需要說清楚他們的工作範圍，在甚麼情況之下他們可以做甚麼工作等，我們正在研究。

至於你的第二個問題，即使在過往，真正需要成立獨立調查委員會的都是非常大的事件，很少是一些部門行政上的，不是小問題、是大問題，但這些都是比較少，通常是非常大的問題，可能有涉及人命傷亡等才會成立。所以未來一般部門的行政上的問題都會用部門首長責任制的機制去調查。

記者﹕局長你好，首先想請問公務員的「跳point」制（增薪點），未來會否有機會再檢視？另外關於部門首長責任制，在甚麼情況下會啓動？例如近期發生的三個簡約公屋被揭發螺絲被剪短，這樣算不算是超重大事件需要展開獨立調查？

公務員事務局局長：我先回答第二個問題，首先是簡約公屋螺絲被剪斷這個問題，這正正是部門能夠發揮其功能，建築署同事能夠及早找到問題，所以不存在部門的行政工作有問題或專業工作有問題，反而是部門在這方面能夠發揮到、及早找到問題所在，所以不需要牽涉到調查，就算有都是要看承建商本身在建築工程發生甚麼問題，這個才是重點。

說回增薪點。其實現時增薪點制度是很清楚與公務員工作表現掛鈎，不過我們也看到公務員的工作表現評核的確在有些個案是有過分寬鬆的現象，所以《施政報告》提出了要建立一個更加嚴謹的評核機制，如果評核機制做得嚴謹的話，自然地增薪點的真正目的便能夠發揮出來。

Reporter: How do you respond to concerns that the current point scale salary structure does not adequately differentiate between high and low performers, what measures are being proposed to address this, and also can you elaborate on the reward and penalty assessment measures that will be implemented under the accountability system? And, will the findings from second tier investigations be disclosed to the public?

Secretary for the Civil Service: For civil servants, we have an appraisal system, a system that assesses the performance levels of civil servants. We have observed that in some cases, the assessment is done in a more lenient than realistic way, and so we are now proposing to establish a more stringent appraisal system that reflects more accurately the performance of civil servants. And with this, and with the incremental point system closely associated with the performance of civil servants, when we have a more realistic, more accurate assessment of civil service performance, the incremental point system will also achieve its objective of rewarding only those who have performed well. As for the Heads of Department Accountability System, I believe when the second tier investigation has to be triggered when the Public Service Commission has to come into work to do the investigation, it must be something that the public is very concerned about. The Government, as always, in these circumstances, will disclose or will let the public know in an appropriate way the details of the case and what are the findings, and so on. In some cases, the investigation may involve personal data, privacy concern and so on, so the government will see to an appropriate way of disclosing details to the public. But as always, we will be transparent, we will let the public informed of matters that they are concerned about.

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-11 13:24,2025-10-11 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/11/P2025101100404.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 11) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

CHP investigates case of methanol poisoning,2025-10-10 22:47,2025-10-10 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/10/P2025101000949.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (October 10) investigating a case of methanol poisoning and appealed to members of the public not to purchase and consume alcohol from doubtful sources.

  The CHP received notification from the Hospital Authority (HA) today of a case involving an 86-year-old male who was a chronic drinker and presented with visual loss in mid-September. He sought medical attention and was hospitalised for management. He is currently in stable condition. Clinical and laboratory examination revealed elevated serum methanol level, and abnormal serum and urine formic acid (a metabolite of methanol) levels. The clinical diagnosis was methanol poisoning.

The Hong Kong Poison Control Centre of the HA having evaluated the patient's clinical and laboratory results and believed that the patient might have ingested or been exposed to methanol. Consumption of alcohol containing methanol could not be excluded. The CHP has immediately conducted a home visit today with the HA and Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department to look for possible sources of methanol exposure. The investigation is ongoing.

The CHP has reminded the HA to heighten vigilance to poisoning symptoms in patients seeking treatment recently in public hospitals. No other cases of methanol poisoning have been found so far.

According to CHP's records, only one case of methanol poisoning was notified to the CHP in the past five years. The case occurred in 2024 and involved a 47-year-old ship crew member who presented with visual loss after consuming a self-prepared mixture of wine and hand rub.

The DH reminded the public that methanol is a toxic alcohol which is not intended for ingestion. Consumption of methanol can lead to damage to the central nervous system, blindness, or even death.
 
Members of the public are reminded not to purchase and consume alcohol from doubtful sources and to attend hospital for medical attention immediately if they suspect methanol poisoning."

The briefing included sharing by filmmakers who are former FFFI participants on their experiences with the Initiative and in film production. The briefing also had a networking session to facilitate interaction and exchanges between aspiring filmmakers and industry professionals.

  Speaking at the briefing session, the Assistant Commissioner for Cultural and Creative Industries and the Secretary-General of the Hong Kong Film Development Council, Mr Gary Mak, remarked that FFFI was launched in 2013 aiming to nurture emerging talent in the local film industry. Over the past eight editions, the number of winning entries amounted to 30, with 18 already screened. These selected new directors and films have garnered numerous nominations and awards in various film events, with some achieving notable box office success. Mr Mak added that many of these new directors, building on the success of their first film, have since embarked on their subsequent work and some are even already working on their third film, showing a highly encouraging development.

  The briefing session attracted about 170 attendees, including past FFFI winners now working in the film industry who offered valuable advice with reference to the difficulties and challenges they faced during the competition process and on experiences in communication between actors and directors. Attendees also took part in a networking session to exchange ideas with practitioners from the film industry.

  Jointly organised by the Hong Kong Film Development Council (HKFDC) and CCIDA, FFFI is funded by the Film Development Fund to support winning new directors and their production teams to make their first feature films. In the past three years, HKFDC and CCIDA have sponsored 13 FFFI directors to attend 46 overseas film festivals and screening events, enhancing the exposure of these new directors and assisting them in building international connections and interacting with filmmakers outside Hong Kong. In addition, CCIDA has nominated or subsidised FFFI participants to attend local and overseas workshops and training programmes to broaden the development and exposure opportunities for filmmakers of the new generations.

  Applications for the 9th First Feature Film Initiative are open. The deadline for applications is December 15. The competition is divided into the Higher Education Institution Group and the Professional Group. Production teams wishing to join the film industry are encouraged to participate. For details of the application guidelines, please visit the HKFDC's website (www.fdc.gov.hk/en/fffi), the FFFI Facebook page (www.facebook.com/HKFFFI) or Instagram page (www.instagram.com/ccida_fffi)."

醫院管理局香港中毒控制中心經評估病人的臨床和化驗結果，相信病人可能曾進食或接觸甲醇，不排除病人可能曾飲用含有甲醇的酒類。中心今日已即時聯同醫管局及食物環境衞生署食物安全中心到病人的居所視察，追查他可能接觸甲醇的源頭。調查仍在進行。

中心已經提醒醫管局加強留意近期到公立醫院求診病人的臨床中毒症狀，暫時未發現其他甲醇中毒個案。

根據中心的紀錄，過去五年只接獲一宗甲醇中毒病例。個案發生於去年（二○二四年），一名47歲船員用酒精和手部消毒液自行調製一款混合物，飲用後喪失視力。

DH urges positive emotional management to echo World Mental Health Day 2025,2025-10-10 20:15,2025-10-10 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/10/P2025100900583.htm,"To echo World Mental Health Day 2025, the Department of Health (DH) today (October 10) is appealing to the public to pay attention to their own mental well-being and that of their close ones, adopt positive emotional management practices, build a caring and supportive community, and encourage those in need to seek professional help at an early stage. The Government launched the ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"" in 2023, providing 24-hour one-stop support for individuals experiencing emotional distress. Since its launch up to the end of last month, more than 200 000 calls have been received. The Government's one-stop thematic website ""Shall We Talk"" (shallwetalk.hk) also consolidates various mental health hotlines and support services for easy access by people in need.

The World Federation for Mental Health (WFMH) designates October 10 every year as World Mental Health Day to raise global awareness of mental health and to mobilise societal support. This year’s theme is ""Access to Mental Health Services in Catastrophes and Emergencies"".

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government attaches great importance to public mental health. In the event of catastrophes and emergencies, the Hong Kong Red Cross stands ready to provide immediate mental health support services. On the other hand, the Government has long been providing mental health services to the public through an integrated and multidisciplinary approach, with an aim to enhance the public's mental well-being.

On the promotion and prevention front, the DH and the Advisory Committee on Mental Health jointly implemented the ""Shall We Talk"" mental health promotion and public education initiative through a one-stop thematic website (shallwetalk.hk), social media pages, television and radio programmes, as well as roving outreach programmes in tertiary institutions and the community to promote mental health messages. To facilitate early identification and provide timely interventions and treatment, the Government has launched the Healthy Mind Pilot Project at three District Health Centres (DHC)/Expresses (DHCE) to provide free mental-health assessments and follow-up services. The Government will extend the project in 2026 to cover six more DHCs (i.e. a total of nine DHCs), with follow-up services to be provided by practitioners with an academic background and training in fields such as psychology or counselling. Additionally, to support the mental well-being of ethnic minorities (EMs), the Government announced in the 2025 Policy Address that it would extend the pilot project to provide emotional support and counselling services for EMs for two years.

To cater for the needs of different groups, the Government has also formulated different targeted strategies:

Students
-----------

The Government will regularise the implementation of the Three-tier Emergency Mechanism in secondary schools and extend it on a trial basis to Primary Four to Six students to strengthen support for students in need. Moreover, the DH also promotes mental health at schools through the Whole School Health Programme, with guidelines and checklists provided to participating schools. Health reports will be compiled for each participating school to recommend targeted school-based measures to promote physical activity, healthy eating, mental health and social well-being to improve the physical and psychological health of students. The DH conducts annual health assessments for all primary and secondary day-school students, including psychosocial evaluations via clinical assessments or questionnaires. Students found to have psychosocial or behavioural problems will receive an immediate risk assessment and support, as well as referrals to clinical psychologists of the Student Health Service or other organisations for further assessment and treatment.

Elderly people
-------------------

The DH works with relevant departments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to deliver health talks, workshops, and training for elderly people, their carers, and volunteers to promote mental well-being among the elderly and address their common mental issues, such as depression, anxiety and dementia, while raising public awareness through various media on elderly mental health, including the prevention of elderly suicide. The Elderly Health Centres under the DH also provide health assessments for members using internationally recognised health tools adapted for local elderly, aiming to detect and prevent depression and suicidal risks early among the elderly.

Working population
-------------------------

The DH collaborates with the Labour Department and Occupational Safety and Health Council to execute the Mental Health Workplace Charter to encourage employers to provide mental health-friendly workplaces and commend schools and organisations that can arrange a specific number of staff members to receive mental health training, such as mental health first aid.

The Government encourages individuals in need to seek early professional help or call the Mental Health Support Hotline to obtain immediate assistance. Of the over 200 000 calls received, 509 calls were referred to the Social Welfare Department's Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness and designated hotline for carer support, the Hospital Authority's mental health hotlines, or NGOs for follow up.

The Government will continue to adopt a multipronged strategy to foster close collaboration among government departments and NGOs, fully utilising community resources, experience, and networks to develop a multidisciplinary tiered framework. The ""Stepped Care Model for Mental Health"" is expected to be finalised by the end of this year to better address mental health challenges, and build a caring and harmonious society."
CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-10-10 20:08,2025-10-10 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/10/P2025101000786.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 10) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza B infection.The CHP urged schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 13-year-old girl with good past health. She has developed a fever, a cough, sore throat and running nosesince October 5. Her symptoms persisted and she collapsed at home on October 9. She was immediately sent to the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince of Wales Hospital, and was transferred to the Hong Kong Children's Hospital on the same day. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza B virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza B infection complicated with encephalopathy, myocarditis and shock. She remains hospitalised in the paediatric intensive care unit and is in critical condition.

Her household contacts are currently asymptomatic. Three of her schoolmates in the same form developed mild influenza-like symptoms between October 3 and 9. None of them required hospitalisation. No outbreaks have been reported in other classes at her school so far. The CHP has advised the school on the necessary infection control measures to be implemented and will continue to put the school under medical surveillance.

  ""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illnessoutbreaks in schools since September. As of October 9, 329 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 35 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 179 cases in primary schools and 115 cases in secondary schools. Including the above case, 10 severe paediatric influenza cases involving children aged 3 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year. Eight of them had good past health. Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The 2025/26 SIV Programmes have commenced, offering free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. This year, all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools are allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities.

  ""Currently around 2 300 schools (99 per cent) are going to arrange the SIV school outreach activities, with about 1 300 schools (58 per cent) scheduled to conduct outreach activities by the end of October. A number of schools have already completed their outreach activities. The school list of the 20 schools that will not arrange SIV outreach activities has been uploaded onto the CHP's website to enable parents of the students in those schools to arrange SIV for their children. I urge all schools to arrange outreach activities as soon as possible. Parents should not hesitate. As the saying goes, 'get vaccinated once a year and sooner is better than later'. Parents should arrange for their children to receive SIV as soon as possible to effectively prevent influenza and reduce the risk of serious illness or death from infection,"" Dr Tsui said.

The Government has opened all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission in the 18 districts, and 74 general outpatient clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system.

Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

主席：

我衷心感謝88位議員在過去三日的辯論中，就《施政報告》各項政策措施提出很多寶貴意見。各司局長已就所屬範疇作出回應，我現在代表特區政府作總結回應。

教育、科技、人才一體化發展

教育、科技、人才一體化發展，是新時代發展的基礎性、戰略性支撐。香港在《二○二五年世界人才排名》由去年的第九位大幅躍升至第四位，是歷來最高排名，亦為亞洲之冠，證明本屆政府搶人才的政策措施方向正確，成效顯著，並獲得國際認可。

從二○二二年底至今年八月，我們已成功吸引超過23萬名人才來港工作及發展，豐富了香港的人才庫，為經濟注入新動力。其中高端人才通行證計劃至今續簽率達55%，反映計劃成效穩健。

全球對人才競爭仍然激烈。由我擔任主席的教育、科技和人才委員會去年十二月成立，統籌推進教育、科技和人才一體化融合發展，制訂政策推動育才、匯才、科技協同發展，同時推動國際高端人才集聚香港。教科人委多項政策建議已在今年的《施政報告》中公布。

政府會繼續大力投資教育，致力發展香港成為國際專上教育樞紐，支持專上院校擴容提質，並壯大科研人才庫。為進一步向世界各地推廣香港專上教育，教育局會成立「留學香港專班」，加大推廣香港高等教育，並推出「Hong Kong: Your World-class Campus」大型宣傳計劃，推廣香港優厚學術、科研和國際合作資源等。

在完善創科建設策略布局方面，我們會在明年完成籌建生命健康研發院及香港人工智能研發院，並提速建設第三個「InnoHK創新香港研發平台」，旗下的研發中心亦將於二○二六年上半年陸續成立。此外，我們已推出「前沿科技研究支援計劃」吸引國際科研頂尖人物來港，並會推出「產學創科人才交流計劃」加強產學研聯動發展。

為推動生物醫藥技術的新質生產力產業發展，我們將於二○二六年成立香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心、提交規管醫療器械的立法建議，並優化現行的藥物審批和註冊制度。醫院管理局將成立引進創新藥物及醫療器械辦公室，透過大數據資料分析引進符合病人利益的創新藥械。我們亦將完善香港生物醫藥研發生態圈，例如透過河套「大灣區臨床試驗協作平台」促進港深同步試驗，並構建「大灣區真實世界數據平台」。

安居生活關愛共融

在以改善民生作為施政最終目標的方向下，政府致力推出不同政策措施支援勞工、提升醫療健康、豐富置業階梯、加強社會福利和促進社區發展。

我們堅守本地工人優先就業的原則，並會推出新措施針對性地打擊濫用補充勞工優化計劃、立法完善數碼平台工作者的工傷補償機制，並落實多項改善僱傭權益的措施。

健全的醫療制度對於民生福祉十分重要。政府將繼續強化醫管局的服務、加強以預防為重的基層醫療健康服務，包括提交法案賦權基層醫療署制訂相關服務標準、致力鞏固香港在癌症研究及防控的領先地位、推行精準醫療，以及鼓勵更多人接受精神健康急救培訓，提升市民的精神健康。

本屆政府十分重視保障市民基本的住屋需求，因此一直致力增加公營房屋供應、提升公營房屋建造的成本效益和以立法方式推行「簡樸房」規管制度。而隨着公營房屋供應增加，政府亦會推出更多措施協助公屋居民置業和便利單位的流轉，例如調升綠白表配額比例至五比五、增加「白居二」的配額等。

本屆政府通過政、商、民合作推出的精準扶貧項目措施亦獲社會正面回應。來年，我們會豐富「共創明『Teen』計劃」校友會的活動、進一步增設六個社區客廳、鼓勵更多學校參加在校課後託管服務計劃，以及向兒童發展基金注資，支持弱勢社群小學生的全面發展。

在安老方面，政府將增加4 000張長者社區照顧服務券和1 000張長者院舍照顧服務券，並新增三個長者鄰舍中心和約700個資助安老宿位。同時，政府會優化「離院長者綜合支援計劃」及加強跨境養老，包括在年底前推出試行安排，分擔參加「廣東院舍照顧服務計劃」的長者在當地的部分醫療開支。

為識別和及時支援照顧者，政府正逐步建立數據平台，主動聯絡高風險人士，並已預留每年5億元的經常開支，做好服務承托。

在支援康復人士方面，政府會在二○二六至二七年度增加450個學前康復、日間及住宿康復服務名額。

我們十分重視青年發展。《施政報告》宣布推出青年人才培養計劃，更好裝備香港青年，擴闊他們的國際視野及建立大局觀。啟德「青年驛站」旅舍已開始試業，透過提供實惠的住宿和舉辦多元化交流活動，促進本地、內地及海外青年互動。

在完善地區治理方面，18區關愛隊將展開第二期服務，政府按地區需要新增了三支關愛隊小隊，並優化了第二期服務的關鍵績效指標。政府亦會加強培訓，強化關愛隊應對突發事件的能力。

結語

主席，我再次代表特區政府感謝各位議員在施政報告諮詢期間以及這幾日的辯論中提出的真知灼見。你們讓這份施政報告的施政更加完善，也體現了行政立法的良性互動。

剛才謝偉俊議員提到，議員的職責除了認同政府好的政策措施外，亦會向政府提出批評，希望政府可以改善施政，這點我非常贊同。我們亦特別珍惜和重視議員有建設性的建議，事實上以往亦有不少條例草案，在我們聆聽議員的建議後作出修訂。但謝議員提到，香港市民像是被遺棄的一群，這句我並不是很認同。

事實上，行政長官一直十分重視民生，改善民生亦是特區政府施政的最終目標，所以大家會在《施政報告》中看到很多改善民生的措施，當然《施政報告》中亦有不少振興經濟的措施。其實民生與經濟相輔相成──經濟發展為改善民生提供基礎，而民生改善又為經濟發展注入新動力。所謂「民生在勤，勤則不匱」。過去三年，在本屆政府和市民的共同努力下，多項客觀的評級和排名都證明香港在「一國兩制」下長期繁榮穩定的強大生命力。無論在貿易自由、金融中心地位、創新指數、人才排名以至競爭力都名列前茅。站在「由治及興」的關鍵節點，香港會同時面對挑戰和機遇，但憑藉獨特優勢和祖國的堅強後盾，香港的機遇一定會大於挑戰。

我們深信，只要堅守「深化改革心繫民生」的施政理念，行政立法機關齊心協力，社會各界團結一致，必定能克服困難，登上一個又一個高峰。

我懇請各位議員支持《施政報告》，並且繼續與政府攜手落實當中各項措施，共同為香港開創更美好、更繁榮的未來。我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"

主席：

多謝主席。我非常感謝各位議員，就二○二五年《施政報告》有關房屋事務的措施提出寶貴意見，以及對房屋局的工作表示肯定和支持。爲了提升市民的幸福感及獲得感，本屆政府上任以來，一直不斷推出多項措施，提量、提速之餘，亦提效、提質，亦同時必須要保安全、保質素，切實解決房屋問題。今年的《施政報告》強調施政最終目標是改善民生。房屋局會繼續全力落實一系列房屋政策，協助不同階層市民安居樂業。

今年房屋措施的主調是豐富置業階梯，鼓勵上進上流。隨着公營房屋供應持續增加，政府有空間調整（公共租住房屋）公屋及其他資助出售單位的比例，同時亦都優化資助出售單位的出租、出售及轉讓安排，讓我們的置業階梯更加平衡和更加有活力。

自本屆政府上任以來，經過這三年多的不懈努力，已有超過103 000個家庭獲安排入住公屋或購買資助出售房屋，數字較上一個三年期的大約68 500個大幅增加了五成。現時，我們已經完全扭轉了公營房屋落成量「頭輕尾重」的情況，並成功將輪候公屋的時間封頂。公屋綜合輪候時間已由高峰的6.1年縮短整整一年至今年六月底的5.1 年，亦是二○一八年第一季以來的新低。在接下來的五年，加上「簡約公屋」，我們的總體公營房屋建屋量將達189 000個單位，這個比這屆政府上任的時候增加約八成，每年平均提供超過30 000個公營房屋單位，產出量是近24年來的新高，每一組數字都令人鼓舞。

此外，本屆政府主導推出創新的「簡約公屋」，首兩個位於元朗攸壆路和牛頭角彩興路的「簡約公屋」項目已全面入伙，即時改善了居住於不適切居所的市民的生活環境。大概30 000個「簡約公屋」單位預計將在二○二七年上半年或之前全部落成，穩步邁向在二○二七／二八年度内完成興建的目標。隨着更多「簡約公屋」於明年起陸續落成，我們將進一步邁向二○二六／二七年度公屋綜合輪候時間下降至4.5年的目標。

隨着整體公營房屋供應的提升，以及公屋輪候時間的下降，房屋局可以加大力度，透過推出一系列措施回應市民的置業願望，並且優化相關機制，例如我們會將居屋綠白表配額比例由40：60調升至50：50，鼓勵更多公屋租戶購買居屋成為業主，循置業階梯向上流動，同時騰空原有公屋單位給正在輪候的申請人；（我們）亦由下一期「白居二」起，再增加1 000個配額，總數達7 000個；我們亦會推出資助出售單位「長者業主樓換樓計劃」，容許年滿60歲並擁有單位十年或以上的業主，可在第二市場出售原有單位後，購買一個較小或較偏遠的單位，地區分類會沿用房委會的市區／擴展市區／新界／離島四類。此舉既能夠協助長者騰出現金作生活費，亦都可以騰出市區或較大單位讓有需要家庭申請，達至雙贏局面。

此外，我們容許擁有資助出售單位十年或以上的業主，在繳付出租准許費後將其未補價單位出租予合資格白表申請者。房委會亦會繼續推展正在進行及規劃中的重建計劃，以改善有需要人士的居住環境。

今年《施政報告》房屋措施的另一個重點，是進一步提升公營房屋建造的成本效益。房屋署將成立一個「項目促成辦公室」，由房屋署副署長帶領，以「推進及促成者」的思維模式檢視、理順及推進公營房屋項目，協調各部門加快完成工作。此外，房屋署會實行新項目管理，在達至整體供應和目標的同時，「倒逼」各項目環節加快落成，亦都會試行集中採購及善用標準房屋物料資料庫，以縮短審批流程。

房屋署亦會善用創新科技，例如透過使用自主研發的「BIM系統化地基工程設計」，自動生成樁基設計方案，進一步節省建築成本。

除了上述的工作，房屋局還有一項很重要的工作，就是有序落實「簡樸房」規管制度。我希望在此再次感謝立法會於上月二十六日通過《簡樸房條例草案》，而《簡樸房條例》亦已於上星期五（十月三日）刊憲，並將於明年三月一日生效，為香港告別劣質「劏房」踏出很有意義的一步。在該條例生效當日，房屋局會為現存住宅樓宇分間單位進行登記，並給予寬限期進行改建成為「簡樸房」，及同步接受「簡樸房」申請認證，確保分間單位能夠以安全、衞生和合理的居住環境，方可合法出租作居住用途。我們現正如火如荼地進行一系列的籌備工作，包括透過不同渠道協助分間單位業主、營運者、租客等持份者了解並遵從規管制度。

主席，本屆政府上任時，行政長官已指示我們要走在問題前面，建立一套穩定、能夠持續增加房屋供應的長遠計劃。這三年多以來，房屋局勾劃出一套令香港的房屋政策可以平穩健康發展的策略。整個團隊亦展示了決心、魄力和承擔，以事不避難的態度處理香港大大小小的房屋議題。我們會繼續努力，繼續用心聆聽各位議員的意見，積極落實各項措施，從根本優化香港的房屋系統，提升市民的幸福感和獲得感。希望各位議員能夠支持2025年《施政報告》的致謝動議。我謹此陳辭。"

主席：

感謝議員就《行政長官2025年施政報告》教育相關措施提出寶貴意見，尤其對香港教育發展的支持和肯定，配合國家發展戰略，推動香港教育更高質量發展。

教育、科技與人才的一體發展，是新時代提升香港競爭力的基礎性、戰略性支撐。國家的《教育強國建設規劃綱要》，以二○三五年建成教育強國為目標。為配合國家科教興國戰略，今年《施政報告》清晰規劃香港發展的方向與重點，致力建設香港成為國際教育樞紐、高端人才集聚高地，並在中小學推動教育數字化，裝備年輕一代迎接未來的機遇和挑戰。

「一國兩制」下，香港充分發揮教育高度國際化、多元化的獨特優勢。目前，香港是全球唯一坐擁五所百強大學的城市，其中四所更位列全球最國際化大學的前十名，六個學科躋身全球十大。這些成果都是對香港教育質量與實力的肯定。

感謝議員對香港建設國際教育樞紐的支持，我們會積極推進這個建設，新措施包括：成立「留學香港專班」，與相關政策部門及機構加強聯動，推出「Hong Kong: Your World-class Campus」大型宣傳計劃，制定宣傳策略，組織高校併船出海，推廣「留學香港」品牌，吸引海內外一流教研人才和學生來港升學和進行科研；推出高增值「遊學香港」活動，吸引非本地高中生來港體驗，增加對香港高等教育的認知與認同；另外，教資會（大學教育資助委員會）亦會撥款4,000萬元資助八所資助大學加大國際和內地宣傳。

本地院校循序漸進以超額形式吸納非本地生自費入讀，我們將會調整資助專上院校非本地生學額上限，由目前百分之四十增至百分之五十；資助研究院研究課程的超額收生自資學額上限，亦由百分之一百增至百分之一百二十，支持專上院校擴大規模，提升質素，強化國際化與多元化的校園環境，不單豐富同學的校園學習與生活體驗，更是進一步發揮香港國際專上教育樞紐的優勢。

現時每年15 000個本地生的資助學額維持不變，各大學亦會以謹慎負責的態度，在配套和條件許可的情況下，以超額形式錄取非本地學生。國際化的校園環境，不但促進多元文化共融，亦有利本地同學培養世界視野，拓寬人際網絡。

我特別多謝議員支持北都（北部都會區）大學城的發展。行政長官在「北都發展委員會」下，成立「大學城籌劃及建設組」，由政務司司長擔任組長，成立調研專班，研究發展模式，實地考察不同地方大學城的成功模式，以及廣納意見。教育局會積極參與其中，加快發展北都大學城。

在推動職專（職業專才）教育方面，我們會繼續致力推動傳統學術與職專教育雙軌並行，鼓勵應用科學大學（應科大）與內地和海外龍頭企業加強合作，推動產教融合和聯動推廣。香港應科大聯盟會積極推進與廣東省頂尖職業技術院校合作，共建粵港澳大灣區交流平台。我們會繼續與內地探討落實香港和內地互認副學位程度學歷，促進兩地職專畢業生跨境求職升學。

在推動數字教育方面，我們會在優質教育基金預留20億元，推進中小學數字教育相關支援措施；在二○二六年發表《中小學數字教育藍圖》，包括優化中小學銜接的資訊和創新科技教育課程、訂定「人工智能素養」學習架構、將AI教育融入核心課程，加強老師的AI培訓、引入企業資源等，裝備同學迎接未來﹔我們亦會啓動檢視高中數理科目的課程設置，培育更多修讀科學及數學的學生，為創科發展做好人才支撐。

我感謝議員肯定愛國主義教育的成果。近年，「心繫家國」系列活動成功凝聚學界的力量，建立了更寬更廣的合作平台。由本學年起，我們將把「心繫家國」系列活動恆常化和普及化，進一步加強跨校、跨界別的協作，在認知、情感、實踐三個層面，幫助學生厚植家國情懷；同時優化高中中史（中國歷史）和歷史科課程框架，在內地交流及考察活動提供超過40個建國歷史體驗行程，並會於二○二五／二六學年公布《價值觀教育課程架構》定稿。

此外，教育局非常重視師生的身心健康，我們持續透過跨部門及跨界別合作，從多方面促進學生的精神健康。在二○二五／二六學年，我們恆常化在中學實施三層應急機制，並將此計劃擴展到小學四至六年級試行，以協助中小學及早識別和加強支援有需要的學生。同時，我們會繼續在校園大力推廣《4Rs精神健康約章》，鼓勵更多學校人員接受有關精神健康急救的培訓，以及推展家長教育，全方位守護學生健康成長。

感謝議員就教師專業質素的寶貴意見。教師是立教之本、興教之源。我們高度重視教師隊伍的建設，因應社會對教師專業的期望和要求日益提高，我們研究修訂《教育條例》，引入執業證書和定期更新要求，完善教師註冊機制，確保所有於學校任教的老師均為適合及適當的人選。

執業證書的要求，旨在提升教師行業的專業及操守，同時推動教師與時並進，維護教師團隊的專業質素。目前，我們正就執業證書的要求徵詢律政司意見，以及諮詢業界，聆聽意見，務求有關方案能合乎專業要求而又切合前線實際需要。

教育是百年大計，在香港由治及興的新里程，我們將繼續匯聚各界力量，發揮香港教育優勢，貢獻國家教育強國建設。

主席，我謹此陳辭，請議員支持李慧琼議員動議的致謝議案。多謝。"
"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, chikungunya fever and dengue fever",2025-10-10 18:55,2025-10-10 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/10/P2025101000707.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 10) reported the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

Chikungunya fever

  As of 5pm today, one new case of CF had been recorded.

The case involves a 9-year-old boy living in Sham Shui Po District. Preliminary investigations revealed that he visited Zhaoqing in Guangdong between October 4 and 6. He developed a fever, joint pain and rash yesterday (October 9). He was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre for medical attention on the same day and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the Chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

 Three household contacts of the patient had travelled with him to Guangdong and are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Guangdong during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 29 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Dengue fever

From October 3 to yesterday (October 9), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to India during the incubation period.

As of yesterday, 49 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 40 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded nearly 1 600 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 150 cases were recorded in a week between September 22 to 28, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Chaozhou and Shenzhen.

Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients of DF and CF, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
蚊傳疾病基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況,2025-10-10 18:55,2025-10-10 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/10/P2025101000714.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月十日）公布基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的最新情況。

基孔肯雅熱

截至今日下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱確診個案。

 病人為一名九歲男童，住所位於深水埗區。初步調查顯示，他於十月四日至六日到訪廣東省肇慶市。他昨日（十月九日）出現發燒、關節痛及皮疹，同日被帶到明愛醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

他的三名家居接觸者曾一同到廣東，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處廣東省，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得29宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

登革熱

由十月三日至昨日（十月九日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期到過印度。

截至昨日，今年錄得49宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞去年（二○二四年）錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年已分別錄得超過四萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 500宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得近1 600宗本地感染病例，其中150宗病例於九月二十二日至二十八日的一周內錄得，以廣州、江門、潮州和深圳錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於登革熱及基孔肯雅熱確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

During the visit, she is promoting Hong Kong's new business opportunities and how enterprises can leverage the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force)'s one-stop platform to expand their overseas business to go global via Hong Kong to local government authorities, the Office of the Financial Committee of the Dongguan Municipal Committee of the CPC, the Dongguan Songshan Lake High-Tech Industrial Development Zone (Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone), the Dongguan Binhaiwan New District (Binhaiwan New District) and business communities.

 Ms Lau yesterday (October 9) morning held a meeting with the Deputy Secretary of the CPC Dongguan Municipal Committee and the Mayor of the Dongguan Municipal People's Government, Mr Lv Chengxi, and member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Dongguan Municipal Committee and Vice Mayor of the Dongguan Municipal People's Government Mr Liu Guangbin. Ms Lau stated that Hong Kong enjoys unique advantages in being connected to both the Mainland and the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, with the aim of attracting more enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong, strengthening its headquarters economy. This is particularly well-suited for Dongguan, a major hub with world-class advanced manufacturing industrial clusters. The 2025 Policy Address announced that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will integrate multiple offices to form a one-stop platform and establish the GoGlobal Task Force to develop diversified solutions for enterprises looking to go global. She expressed the hope of better serving enterprises in the Greater Bay Area, including those in Dongguan, in realising their overseas strategies.

 Ms Lau attended the Dongguan-Hong Kong Synergies: Empowered by Capital Investment exchange meeting yesterday afternoon. This event was guided by InvestHK, and the Office of the Financial Committee of the Dongguan Municipal Committee of the CPC, hosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Guangdong of the HKSAR (GDETO) and Nancheng Sub-district Office Dongguan, and organised by Listed Companies Association of Dongguan. Member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Dongguan Municipal Committee and Vice Mayor of the Dongguan Municipal People's Government Mr Zeng Jianpeng delivered the opening speech followed by Ms Lau, who delivered the welcome speech to the enterprises and media representatives. The Director of the GDETO, Miss Linda So, and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) Regional Director for Southern China, Mr Peter Wong, attended the exchange meeting.

 Mr Zeng said, ""Dongguan City is actively encouraging enterprises to expand through the capital market, aiming to establish a Dongguan capital market cluster with a focus on innovation and technology and advanced manufacturing. As one of the world's most influential financial centres, Hong Kong is a preferred destination for Dongguan enterprises seeking overseas listings. Dongguan will continue to improve its policies to support initial public offerings and foster rapid growth through the capital market. This event will provide a platform for exchange and support more high-quality Dongguan enterprises in connecting with the Hong Kong capital market and achieving high-quality development.""

 Ms Lau expressed great anticipation for leveraging the complementary advantages between Dongguan and Hong Kong as well as facilitating enterprises in seizing Hong Kong's opportunities for expansion and upgrading. She said, ""Dongguan and Hong Kong are in close proximity and share a common heritage. Both are key hubs in the Greater Bay Area, and can complement each other in the development of new quality productive forces. Dongguan is a major modern manufacturing hub in the Greater Bay Area, while Hong Kong boasts an international business environment, a sound legal system, a free economy, and a well-developed financial system. As of 2024, 2 620 Mainland enterprises have established operations in Hong Kong, and over 1 400 listed in Hong Kong, including 304 from Guangdong. In fact, with its business advantages as a 'three centres and a hub', Hong Kong has always been the preferred platform for Mainland enterprises to go global. The GoGlobal Task Force as outlined in the Policy Address will integrate Hong Kong's overseas offices, including the InvestHK and the HKTDC, as well as Hong Kong offices on the Mainland, to set up a one-stop platform, the GoGlobal Task Force, to proactively attract Mainland enterprises seeking to expand their overseas business to go global via Hong Kong."" She also took the opportunity to meet with local media to further explain Hong Kong's business advantages and promote the GoGlobal Task Force platform.

 The Head of China Markets of InvestHK, Ms Ying Yu, delivered a keynote speech on Hong Kong's business advantages and services. The Vice President, Global Issuer Services of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Mr Sam Luk, shared the latest developments of Hong Kong's capital market. The conference also covered thematic sharing sessions, where professional services institutions were invited to discuss how Mainland enterprises can make full use of Hong Kong's financing advantages to better realise their going-global strategies. The exchange meeting attracted more than 100 representatives from local enterprises, institutions, and the media.

 Ms Lau today (October 10) conducted visits and meeting discussions with the Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone Administration Committee and key enterprises in the zone. This was the first return visit to the Committee and the zone campus led by Ms Lau since InvestHK signed a memorandum of co-operation with the Committee in August this year. The visit aims to continuously empower enterprises in the zone and help them develop solutions for global expansion. Ms Lau said, ""Our team focuses on the specific needs for enterprises to go global, such as cross-border fund management and overseas networks expansion matters. A professional team will provide support services to help Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone enterprises plan their optimal global expansion strategies. The GoGlobal Task Force platform will also be provided by the Global Expansion Team based at the GDETO, serving as a one-stop contact point for the zone’s enterprises, conducting visits tailored to understand their needs."" At the meeting, Ms Lau also presented the development opportunities of the Northern Metropolis to the Committee. Vice Mayor of the Dongguan Municipal People's Government and the Secretary of the Party Working Committee of the Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone, Mr Chen Qingsong, greeted the InvestHK delegation.

 The same day, she visited the Songshan Lake Huawei Town, the OPPO Smart Manufacturing Centre and the Binhaiwan New District, introducing the HKSAR Government's GoGlobal Task Force to companies and encouraging them to explore Hong Kong's thriving innovation and technology ecosystem and leverage new opportunities in the city to build overseas financing centres, research and development centres, and global management centres.

 Ms Lau and the InvestHK delegation will continue their visit to Dongguan tomorrow (October 11) to discuss with a leading semiconductor materials company on how to leverage the advantages of the Hong Kong platform to upgrade their overseas strategies and realise their global expansion plans."

It was also announced that the Hospital Authority (HA)'s General Out-patient Clinic (GOPC) and Family Medicine Specialist Clinic (FMSC) services will be unified under the name of ""Family Medicine Out-patient Services"" with effect from tomorrow (October 11). The HA's GOPCs and Community Health Centres (CHCs) will also be named as Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs) and Family Medicine Integrated Centres (FMICs) respectively on the same day. The renaming aims to implement the recommendations set out in the Primary Healthcare Blueprint to co-ordinate the HA's repositioning of GOPC services to focus on serving underprivileged groups, and to highlight the development direction of primary healthcare services, which is providing people-oriented services based on Family Medicine principles with a focus on prevention. The information of the HA's 74 FMCs and FMICs is set out at Annex 1.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""The HA's Family Medicine team will focus on caring for the underprivileged groups and become their family doctors, providing them with comprehensive primary healthcare services through the Family Medicine service model. In addition to treating episodic illnesses with relatively mild symptoms, the team will also focus on providing services including personalised health screenings, chronic disease prevention and management, vaccinations, and health education.""

  In addition, the Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, who officiated at the opening ceremony today also announced that the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) has launched a newly designed logo (see Annex 2). The new logo will be displayed at District Health Centres (DHCs)/DHC Expresses under the PHC Commission, as well as the HA's FMCs and FMICs co-ordinated by the PHC Commission, marking a new milestone for Hong Kong's primary healthcare services.

  In developing the strategy to focus on caring for the underprivileged group through a Family Medicine service model, the PHC Commission has been expanding the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme to designated HA's FMCs and FMICs in phases since end-March this year, providing underprivileged groups with hypertension, high blood glucose and hyperlipidaemia screenings, as well as chronic disease management services. Moreover, the HA has incorporated women's health services into designated FMCs and FMICs, providing comprehensive preventive care and health promotion services to eligible underprivileged women.

The total estimated market value was about $1.3 million. The passenger concerned was convicted and sentenced to six months' imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (October 10) for contravening the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) (Cap. 60).

Customs officers intercepted a male passenger, aged 54, on September 10 at the Arrival Hall at HKIA for Customs clearance. Upon examination, the batch of pharmaceutical injections and pharmaceutical products was found inside his check-in suitcases and personal baggage.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds the public not to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong.

Under the IEO, any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

19 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-10-10 18:15,2025-10-10 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/10/P2025101000647.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations for eight consecutive days from October 2 to yesterday (October 9). A total of 13 suspected illegal workers, three suspected employers and three suspected aiders and abettorswere arrested.

  The ImmD has long been highly vigilant against the problem of illegal employment and has taken vigorous and effective enforcement actions. The ImmD has mounted intelligence-led focused operations in multiple targeted locations. During the joint operation with Labour Department codenamed “Lightshadow”, five suspected illegal workers and three suspected aiders and abettors were arrested by ImmD Task Force officers. The five arrested suspected illegal workers were non-ethnic Chinese males aged 21 to 59. Four of them were found to be holders of recognisance forms and were non-refoulement claimants, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong. Furthermore, three suspected aiders and abettors were Hong Kong male residents aged 28 to 50. They were arrested for being suspected of aiding and abetting illegal workers to take up food delivery works, and conspiracy to defraud delivery platforms.

  Among the other anti-illegal worker operations, eight suspected illegal workers and three suspected employers were arrested by ImmD investigation officers. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised one man and seven women, aged 37 to 58. In addition, two women were also suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. Three Hong Kong male residents, aged 34 to 44, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or an identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services.

反非法勞工行動拘十九人（附圖）,2025-10-10 18:15,2025-10-10 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/10/P2025101000648.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月二日至昨日（十月九日）一連八日在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，行動中共拘捕十三名懷疑非法勞工、三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及三名協助及教唆者。

入境處對非法勞工問題一直保持高度警覺，積極採取有力及有效的執法行動。入境處以情報主導的方式，鎖定多個目標地點作重點調查。於聯同勞工處進行的「光影行動」中，入境處特遣隊人員共拘捕五名懷疑非法勞工及三名涉嫌協助及教唆者。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為五名非華裔男子，年齡介乎二十一至五十九歲，當中四名為免遣返聲請人士，並持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。此外，三名涉嫌協助及教唆者為香港居民男子，年齡介乎二十八至五十歲。他們因涉嫌協助及教唆非法勞工從事外賣工作，串謀詐騙外賣平台而被捕。

於其他反非法勞工行動中，入境處調查人員共拘捕八名懷疑非法勞工及三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為一男七女，年齡介乎三十七至五十八歲。另外，兩名女子涉嫌行使及管有懷疑偽造香港身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為三名香港居民男子，年齡介乎三十四至四十四歲。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。
