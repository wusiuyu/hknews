政務司副司長出席「油蔴地警署光影之旅」開幕典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-01-01 19:15,2026-01-01 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100687.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（一月一日）出席「油蔴地警署光影之旅」開幕典禮的致辭：

林建岳主席（香港旅遊發展局主席）、炳強局長（保安局局長鄧炳強）、Rosanna局長（文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩）、Joe處長（警務處處長周一鳴）、華哥（演員任達華）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！在新的一年，我首先祝大家事事順利、身體健康、生活愉快、家庭幸福！

今日是元旦，一般我們出席公開活動都有稿讀，不過元旦我覺得大家是否應該開心些、輕鬆些，剛才司儀也提到今日有別具特色的表演，而我自覺也算是表演的一部分，所以加插少許驚喜給大家，脫稿講一會。大家放心，脫稿所說的內容跟今活動日的主題是很密切的。

我知道今日在場的朋友有很多支持油蔴地警署、警方、警匪片，我想向大家介紹一齣神劇、一齣警匪神劇。這劇在座不是許多人知，因為今早我跟鄧炳強局長在立法會傾談時提過，他說有如此的一齣劇嗎？這證明他以前讀書很乖，不是整天看電視。我估計在座人士，可能有兩個人知道這齣劇，一是林建岳主席，他的年紀跟我差不多，我看過的劇他也可能看過；另一個大家一會兒後便知。這齣劇是叫《CID》。內地來的朋友，可能會問甚麼是CID？那就是我們的便衣警察，全名是Criminal Investigation Department，是刑偵部門。這齣電視劇在一九七六年上演，當時我正讀中五，該劇有譚家明導演、許鞍華導演、劉芳剛導演，這些導演很厲害，拍電視劇用菲林拍，拍出來如電影般。戲裏的主角是黃元申，演雜差沙展的是何璧堅，飾演的角色叫陳展鵬。另外戲裏有些好打得的演員如張雷，還有一個是今日在座的華哥。華哥當年才21歲，稍後有司儀與華哥對談環節，我印象中這齣戲是以九龍的差館做背景，有否曾在油蔴地拍攝呢？要問問華哥才知。

這齣戲影響力很大，起碼影響了我。因為當時就讀中五的我看完這齣戲，非常嚮往做CID鋤強扶弱，於是興起要當差的念頭。那年是一九七六年，我一九八一年進入了警察學堂成為警察，一九八一至一九八四年期間當了3年多的督察，時間不是很長，學堂8個月外，出來做過不少崗位如軍裝、雜更、藍帽子、衝鋒，也上過CID班。一九八四年開始感受到長江後浪推前浪，後面的一些後浪很厲害，就是一九八七年有一位鄧炳強加入警隊，所以我還是快些離開警隊。香港警匪片是影視文化的一大寶藏，內地來的朋友可多些發掘。

言歸正傳，今日很高興出席這個由文化體育及旅遊局轄下文創產業發展處推展的「油蔴地警署光影之旅」開幕典禮。大家看見，舊油蔴地警署是一個歷史悠久及建築極具特色的戰前警署，在此打造一個以經典香港警匪片為主題的展覽，最適合不過、不作他想。

舊油蔴地警署數十年來都是香港警匪片及電視劇的熱門拍攝場地，因此一直都吸引了很多愛好香港警匪片訪客，本地也好海外也好，在門外「打卡」。有見及此，由我擔任主席的「發展旅遊熱點工作組」決定將舊油蔴地警署作為一個展覽的場地，納入去年五月我們公布的九個旅遊熱點之一，也是我們的重點。這個亦是繼去年推出「九龍城寨光影之旅」電影場景展覽之後，第二個以香港電影為主題的旅遊熱點。我們希望將香港電影文化與旅遊結合，豐富香港文化及旅遊體驗，同時帶動香港地區經濟。

「油蔴地警署光影之旅」的展場雖然暫時佔地不大（日後可能會擴充），但內容豐富，讓訪客以沉浸方式重溫經典香港警匪片精華片段及名場面，以及於一個非常有真實感的七、八十年代雜差房裏漫遊。訪客亦有機會去羈留室，該處是首度開放，訪客能嘗試被羈留的感覺，拍照留念。在此，我感謝香港電影專業人士對這個展覽的大力支持，你們的創意和專業令展覽增添很多魅力，更令訪客盡興而歸。

乘着「油蔴地警署光影之旅」的開幕，我們特別向旅客推介舊油蔴地警署周邊的旅遊景點、商戶及食肆。就此，油尖旺民政事務處連同油蔴地街坊會，從今日開始到二月二十二日會在油麻地多個地點舉辦「油麻地美食購物節」，大家憑展覽的紀念票，可以享受商戶及食肆提供的額外優惠。

最後，我祝展覽火速爆紅、客似雲來、門限為穿，香港旅遊愈做愈旺、愈做愈火紅！我亦在此祝旅客在油蔴地警署有個不一樣和歷久難忘的愉快光影體驗。多謝大家。"
"Public healthcare fees and charges reform has officially taken effect, unveiling new chapter in Hospital Authority's sustainable development",2026-01-01 18:30,2026-01-01 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2025123100724.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (January 1) that the public healthcare fees and charges reform is now officially in effect, marking a new chapter in HA's sustainable development. Since January 1 midnight, all HA systems have successfully switched to the new fees and charges mode, with operations at public hospitals running smoothly. The HA will continue to closely monitor hospital operations and deploy additional manpower to provide immediate assistance to those in need, ensuring smooth service delivery.

The reform took effect at midnight, with all public hospital systems, including patient registration, payment, and clinical systems, successfully switching to the new fees and charges mode. The HA Chairman, Mr Henry Fan, and the HA Chief Executive, Dr Libby Lee, visited Kwong Wah Hospital at midnight to observe the implementation of the new charging mode and the transition process. They also communicated with all clusters through video conferencing to ensure implementation and support measures were in place.

The HA Chairman, Mr Henry Fan, said, ""The successful implementation of the reform marks a significant milestone in our public healthcare system. The reform will enhance protection for poor, acute, serious and critical patients, enabling sustainable development of public healthcare services to meet the challenges posed by Hong Kong's aging population. We especially thank all staff for their co-operation in implementing the reform and patients for their understanding of the new arrangements. The HA will continue to implement various measures to enhance patient protection and improve public healthcare services.""

Accident and Emergency departments (A&E), which operate 24 hours a day, are among the first clinical departments to implement the new fees and charges arrangements. The HA has adopted flexible arrangements, allowing a small number of patients who completed registration just after midnight to pay the old fees. The HA Chief Executive, Dr Libby Lee, said, ""After the New Year holiday, many clinical departments in public hospitals will resume normal services. We have deployed additional manpower, including service ambassadors, dedicated teams, and volunteers to station at outpatient clinics, shroffs and pharmacies for answering patient inquiries, assisting with payments, appointments, and applications for medical fee waivers. Hospitals and specialist outpatient clinics have also set up information counters where dedicated staff provide on-site responses to public inquiries.""

The HA will closely monitor operations at all hospitals. Meanwhile, patients are reminded that with the official implementation of the new fees and charges arrangements (Annex), some medical service procedures may be modified. Each hospital cluster has set up hotlines (see table below) for patients to inquire about the reform arrangements. Patients can also visit the HA website for related information.

The HA emphasises that with the comprehensive implementation of the reform measures, an enhanced medical fee waiver mechanism has also been introduced. Over 50 000 patients have already submitted advance applications or filed enquiries, with the majority of applications processed. Eligible patients will gradually receive their medical fee waiver certificates, enabling them to have fee waivers granted at their next follow-up consultation. The HA has established dedicated teams to assist patients with fee waiver applications and will increase manpower to shorten processing times.

During the transition period from January to March, patients requiring immediate or urgent treatment, who cannot afford medical expense at the public sector, but cannot provide complete documentation for financial assessment, will be granted ""conditional waivers"" for full or partial medical fees. Patients need only submit relevant documents within three months to receive official medical fee waiver certificates upon passing the assessment.

Patients currently holding medical fee waiver certificates (full or partial), can continue using them until expiry without reapplication. Patients with partial fee waiver certificates who qualify for full waivers under the enhanced mechanism can obtain full waivers by declaring no significant change in financial status at Medical Social Services Units three months before appointments or within three months after hospitalisation, without requiring reassessment. The validity will be the same as the original certificate's expiry date.

In addition to enhancing the medical fee waiver mechanism, the HA has established a second safety net by introducing an annual cap of $10,000 on medical service charges (excluding self-financed items). This expanded safety net aims to help citizens reduce the heavy financial burden of medical expenses arising from unexpected serious illnesses or chronic conditions. Furthermore, the HA will strengthen the healthcare protection of critically-ill patients. This includes accelerating the introduction of more effective innovative drugs and devices, and relaxing the eligibility criteria of means test for the safety net applications, so that more middle-income patients can receive subsidy for self-financed drugs and devices. Patients currently receiving partial subsidy will also be able to access increased support. During the implementation of fees and charges reform measures, the HA will adhere to the principle that the Government's commitment to public health will remain unchanged. All gains from the reform will be wholly utilised for public healthcare services.

The HA emphasises that it has increased manpower to assist patients in need with fee waiver applications and other enhanced protection measures, ensuring that no citizen will be denied appropriate medical care due to financial difficulties. With all enhanced patient protection measures in place, the number of beneficiaries will increase significantly from the current 300 000 to approximately 1.4 million. Together with about 600 000 Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above, and holders of Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme Level 0 vouchers who will continue to receive full fee waivers, it is estimated that around 2 million people will benefit in total, substantially strengthening patient protection.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-01 17:30,2026-01-01 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100562.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————
本港今年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自十二月十日確診一宗於十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-01 17:30,2026-01-01 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100563.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 1), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10 of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

公營醫療收費改革正式推行　掀開醫管局持續發展新篇章,2026-01-01 16:45,2026-01-01 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2025123100720.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）今日（一月一日）正式推行公營醫療收費改革（收費改革）的各項措施，標誌着醫管局掀開持續發展的新篇章。踏入一月一日凌晨零時，醫管局的不同系統已順利切換至新收費模式，各公立醫院的運作亦非常暢順。醫管局會繼續密切監察各醫院的運作情況並加派人手，為有需要市民提供即時協助，確保各項服務繼續運作暢順。

收費改革於凌晨零時生效，各公立醫院所有系統，包括病人登記、收‍費及臨床醫療系統等轉換過程順暢。醫管局主席范鴻齡及行政總裁李夏茵醫生在午夜巡視廣華醫院，了解啓動新收費模式和轉換過程的運作情況，並透過視像會議與各聯網聯繋，確保執行工作及各項支援措施準備妥當。

醫管局主席范鴻齡說︰「醫管局推行收費改革，是公營醫療系統的重要里程碑。收費改革可以加強對貧、急、重、危病人的保障，公營醫療服務得以持續發展，應對香港人口老化對醫療系統帶來的種種挑戰。我們特別感謝所有員工配合收費改革的工作，亦感謝病人理解各種新安排，醫管局會繼續推行不同措施，加強對病人的保障及提升公營醫療服務。」

24小時運作的急症室是最先實行新收費安排的公立醫院臨床部門，醫管局已採取彈性安排，容許少部分在零時零分後才完成登記的病人，仍然繳交舊收費，整體過程十分順利。行政總裁李夏茵醫生表示︰「在元旦假期後，公立醫院不少臨床部門會恢復正常服務，我們已加派人手，包括服務大使、專隊職員及義工等，派駐在門診、繳費處、藥房等地方，專責解答病人查詢、協助處理繳費、預約及申請醫療費用減免等安排。各醫院和專科門診診所亦增設諮詢站，由專責同事即場解答市民查詢。」

醫管局會密切監察各醫院的運作情況，同時亦提醒病人，隨着新收費安排（附件）正式推行，部分醫療服務的流程亦有轉變，各醫院聯網已設立查詢熱線（詳見下表），供病人查詢收費改革的各項安排，病人亦可瀏‍覽醫管局網頁查閱相關資訊。

醫管局強調，隨着收費改革各項措施全面推行，醫管局亦會實施優化醫療費用減免機制，至今已有超過50000名病人預先提出申請及查詢，大部分申請者的審批工作已經完成，合資格病人將會陸續收到醫療費用減免證明書，可以在下次覆診時獲得醫療費用減免。醫管局已設立專責隊伍協助病人處理申請醫療費用減免的相關事宜，亦會加強人手縮短處理時間。

在一至三月的過渡期間，醫管局會採取特別安排，有經濟困難的病人，如需即日或緊急接受治療，但又未能提供相關文件完成經濟審查，醫管局會發出「有條件減免」豁免全額或部分醫療費用。病人只需在三個月內補交相關文件，通過審查後便可獲發正式醫療費用減免證明書。

至於現時已持有醫療費用減免證明書（不論全額或部分減免）的病人，可繼續獲得減免，毋須重新申請，直至證明書的有效期完結為止。若病人現時持有部分醫療費用減免證明書，並符合放寬後全額減免的資格，病人可在預約就診前三個月內或住院後的三個月內，前往醫務社會服務部，聲明財務狀況無顯著變化後，便可根據新準則獲得全額減免，毋須再次進行評估，而有效期至原有醫療費用減免證明書到期日。

除了優化醫療費用減免機制，醫管局亦引入第二層安全網，設立醫療服務全年一萬元收費上限（自費藥械除外），將更多有需要的病人納入安全網內，旨在幫助市民減輕一旦不幸患上突發重病或長期病而衍生的沉重醫療費用負擔。此外，醫管局會加強危重病人藥械保障，包括加快引入更多有效創新藥械，放寬安全網申請資格，讓更多中等收入家庭病人可獲安全網資助購買自費藥械，而現時獲部分資助的病人亦可獲得更多資助。醫管局在推動各項新措施時，會堅守政府對公共醫療承擔不變的原則，改革所得將會全數投放公營醫療。

醫管局強調，已加強人手協助有需要的病人申請醫療費用減免或處理其他加強保障病人的措施，確保不會有市民因為經濟困難而未能接受合適醫療服務。隨著所有加強保障病人的措施實施，受惠病人數目會由現時約30萬人，大幅增加至約140萬人，再加上大約60萬名綜援受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受助人及長者院舍照顧服務券計劃級別0院舍券持有人，將會繼續獲全額醫療費用減免，估計日後合共有約200萬人受惠，大幅加強對病人的保障。

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-01 16:24,2026-01-01 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100571.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月一日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-01 16:24,2026-01-01 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100578.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 1) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

行政長官出席第八屆立法會議員宣誓致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-01-01 13:10,2026-01-01 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/01/P2026010100428.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（一月一日）出席第八屆立法會議員宣誓的致辭：

各位議員：

今天是二○二六年的第一天，也是香港特區第八屆立法會議員宣誓就任的重要日子。我首先向各議員表示祝賀，並祝大家新年進步。

今天的宣誓，代表着你們每一位的莊嚴承諾與承擔。各位議員今天宣誓獲確認有效後，便正式展開履行第八屆立法會議員的使命，我對你們的工作寄予厚望，我有三個期盼：

第一，是貫徹「行政主導」與「愛國者治港」原則相適應的方針。根據《基本法》，香港實行的是以行政長官為核心的行政主導體制。習近平主席在本屆特區政府上任時發表七一重要講話中，明確要求香港特區堅持實行行政主導體制，行政、立法、司法機關依照《基本法》和相關法律履行職責，行政機關和立法機關既互相制衡又互相配合。習近平主席上月在北京聽取我述職時明確要求，特區政府必須「堅持和完善行政主導」。港澳辦夏寶龍主任亦就相關議題致辭時指出，行政長官在特區政權架構及其運行中處於主導和核心位置。

過去三年半，我以行動實踐「行政主導」，主動推動建立行政立法良性互動的關係，我提出創新的前廳交流會，由司長或副司長每月帶領相關官員到立法會前廳與議員交流溝通，之後我推行先驅性的「行政長官互動交流答問會」，透過設定重大、宏觀及策略性的議題，和議員互動交流意見，建立共識，和各議員在「行政主導」和「愛國者治港」原則相適應下，共同發揮建設香港的力量和價值。

「愛國者治港」不是口號，必須實實在在地落實在實踐中。議會運作要堅持理性、專業和建設性，實現高效高質量議政，這些是對行政立法雙方既互相制衡，又互相配合的重要考驗。

第二，議員貫徹和遵守《立法會議員守則》（《守則》）。《守則》是去年立法會為更好完善議員履職制度而制定，於今年今日正式實施。

《守則》訂明議員應恪守的守則，包括：維護憲制秩序、維護國家安全、維護行政主導體制、堅守法治、廉潔奉公和盡忠職守等。《守則》也定下操守標準，包括議員須基於事實和證據議政論政，不可無中生有，不可作出偏頗或侮辱性的言論或人身攻擊。議員以國家根本利益和香港社會整體利益行事，不應只追求個人政治利益與榮耀。《守則》說明議員不得在沒有合法權限下，披露保密文件、資料或信息。議員履職時不應只當評論者，而應積極發揮民意代表的角色，向政府積極進言，並盡力提出有效的解決方案。

第三，議員議政既要關心個別的微觀需要，亦要考慮社會整體的宏觀利益，有大局觀、國家觀和國際觀。《基本法》賦予立法會重要職權，包括制定、修改和廢除法律，審核、通過財政預算，批准稅收和公共開支等。從憲制秩序中可明顯見到，立法會議員比區議員的要求更高，立法會除考慮地區問題，亦要關注香港整體的全局和宏觀性問題。這亦是《立法會議員守則》所指，議員要以國家利益和社會整體利益行事的要求。

我多次在立法會提出要學習和履行二十大報告內提出的「系統觀念」。「系統觀念」有三個重點：第一，分析問題時要把握好五個關係，即全局和局部、當前和長遠、宏觀和微觀、主要矛盾和次要矛盾、特殊和一般的關係；第二，探索問題時要通過歷史看現實，要透過現象看本質；即看事情不可只看表面，例如某人表面上看似提出問題，實質動機是否借意唱衰、是否搞分化、是否軟對抗等，我們必須透過現象判斷事情的本質，是真關心事情，還是借題挑撥矛盾，搞破壞；第三，處理問題時要提高戰略思維、創新思維、底線思維等能力。慎防以偏概全的單一角度思維，忽略相連風險和牽引的骨牌效應。有評論家曾就各種議會的行事生態進行分析，發現不同議會普遍有愈走愈趨民粹、愈單一角度、愈有看小不看大的現象，這些都是我們要共同警惕的。

展望未來，今年是國家「十五五」規劃開局之年，亦是特區政府進一步深化改革、全力拼經濟、謀發展、搞建設、惠民生的一年。期望各議員成為政府的治港和改革夥伴，尤其在兩方面，（一）主動融入和服務國家發展大局，包括主動對接「十五五」規劃、更好統籌發展和安全，加快發展北部都會區，鞏固和提升香港國際競爭力等；（二）共同推動火災後的支援和重建工作，推行系統性改革，打破利益藩籬，不允許悲劇再發生。

各位議員，在新一屆立法會開始之際，我期望在行政主導和「愛國者治港」原則相適應下，行政立法共同為建設更美好香港，團結一致，發展經濟、改善民生、深化改革、同創未來。

多謝大家。"

At present, the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong serve as hubs to co-ordinate various primary healthcare services as needed for the affected residents. The HHB announced today (January 1) the latest figures of these services:

DHC hotlines

  Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1, 2025, (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services provided by private family doctors and Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary, and making referrals to necessary healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. The services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow‑up appointments and medication refill service points, from the Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts.

業界如持有其他來自受影響區域的介貝類海產產品，應立即停售。

發言人指出，由於介貝類海產包括蠔隻以過濾大量海水的方式進食，如果養殖或採集介貝類海產的水域水質帶有病原體，這些物質便會在介貝類海產的體內積聚。生或未徹底煮熟的介貝類海產是高風險食物，孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士及肝病患者等容易受感染的人士，應避免進食生蠔。

中心會通知法國當局，亦會知會本地業界，並繼續跟進事件及採取適當行動，以保障食物安全和市民健康。調查仍然繼續。"
Trade instructed to suspend importing and selling shellfishes harvested in area Étang de Thau in France,2025-12-31 21:50,2025-12-31 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/31/P2025123100762.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (December 31) instructed the trade to suspend the import of shellfishes harvested in area Étang de Thau in France. The trade should also stop using or selling the product concerned immediately should they possess it.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS noted a notification from the Rappel Conso of France that shellfishes harvested in area Étang de Thau in France were suspected to be contaminated with norovirus and under recall. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately conducted investigation and contacted local major importers for follow-up. A preliminary investigation by the CFS found that a local importer, City Super Limited, had imported and sold the raw oysters harvested in the area concerned. For the sake of prudence, the CFS has immediately suspended the import into and sale within Hong Kong of shellfishes harvested in the area concerned, and instructed the importer to stop sale of, remove from shelves and recall the affected oysters. Members of the public may call the hotline of City Super Limited at 2736 3866 during office hours for enquiries about the recall of the products concerned.""

The trade should also stop selling other shellfishes products from the affected area if they possess them.

The spokesman pointed out that as shellfishes including oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater, pathogens can accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Raw or partially cooked shellfishes are high-risk foods. Susceptible groups, such as pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, should avoid eating raw oysters.

The CFS will inform the French authorities and will also notify the local trade. It will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. An investigation is ongoing."
