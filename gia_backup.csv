食環署多管齊下滅蚊並呼籲市民加強防蚊以防範基孔肯雅熱,2025-07-26 16:55,2025-07-26 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600587.htm,"​食物環境衞生署（食環署）表示，因應近期鄰近地區和部分海外國家的基孔肯雅熱個案數字大幅上升，近日已採取多管齊下的措施以加強防控蚊患，並呼籲市民加強防蚊滅蚊措施。食環署並會聯同衞生署與物業管理業界等持份者會面，㩦手加強滅蚊措施。

基孔肯雅熱是經蚊子傳播的疾病，​​因此，食環署正採取以下防控蚊患措施以保障市民健康:


在各分區召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」會議。專責小組成員包括各相關部門和持分者，將根據最新的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，對各區蚊患風險較高的地點採取具針對性和持久性的防蚊滅蚊行動；
聯同房屋署及康文署等不同部門在公共地方、公共屋邨、公園等加強巡查，如發現蚊子滋生地，會即時採取行動，包括進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊、清除積水及儲水容器、施用殺幼蟲劑（例如蚊沙）、增設蚊子陷阱等；
加強巡查建築地盤及工地，以及私人住宅，對發現蚊子滋生的違規情況採取執法行動；
通過向物業管理公司及組織發信及舉辦講座，向物業管理業界講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況及防蚊資訊。此外，邀請房屋署及物業管理公司在屋邨及屋苑進行滅蚊運動，並鼓勵居民參與；
聯同各區民政事務處，協助有蚊蟲滋生情況的地方如三無大廈進行防蚊滅蚊工作；
持續加強公眾教育及宣傳，通過宣傳短片、海報及單張等途徑，提醒市民採取措施防治蚊患。此外，加強發布各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，提高指數較高地區市民的防蚊意識。


除政府及業界的努力，市民大眾的參與亦至關重要。食環署呼籲市民繼續攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括：


保持環境衞生，妥善棄置垃圾，特別是空罐和飯盒等容易積水的廢物應置於有蓋的垃圾桶內；
每星期清洗花盆底碟及避免積水；
每星期更換花瓶內的水及洗刷花瓶內壁；
蓋好水桶、水盆等貯水容器；及
檢查雨傘架、雨傘筒和冷氣機托盤，避免出現積水。


此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823。有關更多基孔肯雅熱的資訊，請瀏覽衞生署衞生防護中心的基孔肯雅熱專題網頁：www.chp.gov.hk/tc/features/109029.html。"
一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-07-26 15:32,2025-07-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600543.htm,"​一名入境男旅客因管有未完稅香煙及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》，今日（七月二十六日）在九龍城裁判法院被判處監禁六個月及罰款八百元。

海關人員昨日（七月二十五日）在香港國際機場截查一名十八歲的抵港男旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲四萬二千五百八十七支未完稅香煙，估計市值約十七萬五千元，應課稅值約十四萬一千元。該名抵港男旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
An incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-07-26 15:32,2025-07-26 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600546.htm,"âAn incoming male passenger was sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment and fined $800 at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts today (July 26) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the 18-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (July 25) and seized 42 587 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $175,000 and a duty potential of about $141,000 from his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
商經局局長在寧波出席第二屆浙港現代專業服務合作會議（附圖）,2025-07-26 15:30,2025-07-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600251.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（七月二十六日）在浙江寧波出席第二屆浙港現代專業服務合作會議，促進兩地專業服務領域的合作，優勢互補。

丘應樺在開幕式上致辭時表示，今年四月「浙港合作會議」機制正式成立，並舉行浙港高層會晤暨浙港合作會議第一次會議，而投資香港推介大會——浙江（寧波）專場暨甬港經濟合作論壇亦緊接於寧波舉行。他非常高興能再次到訪寧波，進一步推動浙港、甬港經貿合作交流。

他指出，浙江是國家的經濟大省，地區生產總值名列前茅。在推動產業升級轉型、發展新質生產力方面，尤其創新科技和人工智能更是迅速發展。另一方面，香港科研實力亦很強，國際化程度高，國際交流合作網絡廣泛，有潛力成為全球重要的教育、科技和人才中心。

丘應樺表示，在「浙港合作會議」機制的基礎上，浙港兩地將聯手推動包括會計審計、法律及爭議解決服務、管理諮詢、知識產權、工業設計、規劃設計、建築及相關工程等專業服務領域的合作。

他續指，在金融領域，香港擁有優質高效、國際化的金融機構和金融服務，以及既深且廣的資本市場，是理想的籌融資平台。香港亦是全球第五大的商品貿易經濟體系，排在內地、美國、歐洲聯盟和日本之後。

丘應樺提到，儘管全球貿易格局和地緣政治不斷變化，帶來不明朗因素，香港實質本地生產總值在今年第一季按年增加3.1%。今年上半年，香港共完成了42宗首次公開招股，集資額超過1,070億港元，比二○二四年全年多兩成。截至今年六月，申請在港上市的企業當中，浙江企業有19家，佔申請上市企業總數約一成，充分反映香港穩健的金融市場已成為內地企業首選的上市平台。

丘應樺相信，浙港兩地在堅實的經貿合作基礎上，可共同提升現代專業服務合作，吸引全世界的投資者以香港作為跳板，開拓規模和潛力巨大的浙江市場，浙江企業則可透過香港的專業服務走向世界市場。

其他在開幕式致辭的包括全國政協副主席梁振英、中央統戰部副部長馬利懷、浙江省政協主席廉毅敏和寧波市市長湯飛帆。運輸及物流局副局長廖振新和創新科技及工業局副局長張曼莉亦有出席開幕式，並參與兩場專場活動，推動兩地在港口及航運服務、創新應用、科技服務等領域的協同發展。

丘應樺今日傍晚返抵本港。"
SCED attends 2nd Zhejiang-Hong Kong Modern Professional Services Cooperation Conference in Ningbo (with photo),2025-07-26 15:30,2025-07-26 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600250.htm,"The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, attended the 2nd Zhejiang-Hong Kong Modern Professional Services Cooperation Conference in Ningbo, Zhejiang, today (July 26) to foster co-operation between the two places in the field of professional services to achieve complementarity.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Mr Yau said that right after the establishment of the Hong Kong/Zhejiang Co-operation Conference Mechanism and the convening of the High-Level Meeting cum the First Plenary Session of the Hong Kong/Zhejiang Co-operation Conference in April this year, the Hong Kong Investment Promotion Conference - Zhejiang (Ningbo) Forum cum Ningbo-Hong Kong Economic Co-operation Forum was held in Ningbo. He said he was very pleased to visit Ningbo again to further promote Zhejiang-Hong Kong and Ningbo-Hong Kong economic and trade co-operation.

Mr Yau said that Zhejiang is an economic powerhouse of the country with its GDP ranking among the top and has been a leading force in advancing the upgrading and transformation of industries and the development of new quality productive forces, especially in the areas of innovation and technology and artificial intelligence. On the other hand, Hong Kong, with its robust research capabilities, high level of internationalisation and extensive networks for international exchange and co-operation, presents vast potential in becoming a globally significant hub for education, technology and talent.

Mr Yau said that building on the foundation of the Hong Kong/Zhejiang Co-operation Conference Mechanism, the two places will work together to promote collaboration in the field of professional services such as accounting and auditing, legal and dispute resolution, management consulting, intellectual property, industrial design, planning and design, architectural and related engineering services.

He added that in the areas of finance, Hong Kong boasts quality, efficient and internationalised financial institutions and financial services, as well as a deep and broad capital market, making it an ideal fundraising platform. Hong Kong is also the world's fifth-largest merchandise trading entity, after the Mainland, the United States, the European Union and Japan.

Mr Yau noted that despite uncertainties brought about by the ever-changing global trade landscape and geopolitics, Hong Kong's real GDP recorded a year-on-year increase of 3.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. In the first half of this year, Hong Kong has completed 42 initial public offerings, raising over HK$107 billion, 20 per cent more than the full-year total for 2024. As at June this year, among the enterprises applying for listing in Hong Kong, 19 of them were from Zhejiang, accounting for about 10 per cent of the total number of applicants. This fully reflected that Hong Kong's robust financial market has become the prime listing platform for Mainland enterprises.

Mr Yau said he believes that with a solid foundation of economic and trade co-operation, Zhejiang and Hong Kong can jointly strengthen collaboration in modern professional services, attracting global investors to use Hong Kong as a springboard to tap into the immense potential of the enormous Zhejiang market, while enabling Zhejiang enterprises to go global by making use of Hong Kong's professional services.

Also speaking at the opening ceremony were Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Mr C Y Leung; Deputy-Head of the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee Mr Ma Lihuai; the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Mr Lian Yimin; and the Mayor of the Ningbo Municipal People's Government, Mr Tang Feifan. The Under Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mr Liu Chun-san, and the Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Ms Lillian Cheong, also attended the opening ceremony. In addition, Mr Liu and Ms Cheong attended two thematic sessions to promote the synergistic development of the two places in areas such as port and maritime services, innovative applications and technological services.

Mr Yau will return to Hong Kong this evening."

HKSAR Government disapproves of and opposes untrue and biased remarks by UK,2025-07-26 13:48,2025-07-26 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600445.htm,"âThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (July 26) strongly disappoved of and opposed untrue and biased remarks by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom (UK) Mr David Lammy and the Home Secretary of the UK Ms Yvette Cooper on HKSAR's lawful act to pursue wanted persons endangering national security absconding from Hong Kong.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. No country will watch with folded arms on acts and activities that endanger national security. The 'Hong Kong Parliament' aims to subvert state power; its objectives include promoting 'self-determination', promulgating the so-called 'Hong Kong Constitution', and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People's Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of the central power of People’s Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR with unlawful means, thereby suspected of having committed the offence of 'Subversion' contrary to Article 22 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). Thus, Police applied to the court for arrest warrants in accordance with the law and put the persons on wanted list.""

""Extraterritorial effect for the offences under the HKNSL and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Hong Kong Police are duty bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security overseas. Those absconders hiding in the UK and other Western countries are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security. More so, they continue to collude with external forces to cover for their evil deeds. It is necessary for the Police to take all lawful measures to strongly combat the acts of abscondment, and such actions are fully justified, necessary and legitimate.

In accordance with international law and international practice based on the Charter of the United Nations, it is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. With at least 14 pieces of laws in the UK safeguarding national security, the UK has displayed hypocrisy and exposed its double standards by pointing fingers at the HKSAR's legal system and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, while entirely disregarding the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and protection of human rights.

The spokesman said, ""Any individuals who endanger national security should not believe that being outside Hong Kong will allow them to evade criminal responsibility and remain beyond the reach of justice. The HKSAR Government will exhaust all means to pursue and combat criminals absconding from Hong Kong and endangering national security, ensuring that violations of the law will be pursued regardless of the distance. The HKSAR Government urged those wanted persons to return to Hong Kong and surrender so as to rectify their mistakes.""

""Regarding the surrender of fugitive offenders, in accordance with the instruction of the Central People's Government (CPG), the HKSAR Government has suspended the agreement between the HKSAR Government and the Government of the UK concerning surrender of fugitive offenders in July 2020. The relevant position remains unchanged. All along, with the authorisation and assistance of the CPG, the HKSAR Government has conducted law enforcement co-operation and mutual legal assistance with other jurisdictions in accordance with the law based on the principle of mutual assistance and reciprocity. The HKSAR Government will, as always, handle relevant matters appropriately.""

The spokesman emphasised, ""The HKSAR Government will continue to resolutely discharge the duty of safeguarding national security, whilst upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly demands the UK Government to immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters which are purely China's internal affairs."""
特區政府強烈不滿和反對英國的不實和偏頗言論,2025-07-26 12:45,2025-07-26 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600400.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（七月二十六日）就英國外交大臣林德偉和英國內政大臣顧綺慧有關特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的不實和偏頗言論，表示強烈不滿和反對。

特區政府發言人表示︰「危害國家安全是嚴重的罪行，沒有國家會對危害國家安全的行為和活動袖手旁觀。『香港議會』旨在顛覆國家政權，其目標包括推動『自決』、制定所謂『香港憲法』，以非法手段推翻、破壞《中華人民共和國憲法》所確立的中華人民共和國根本制度或推翻中華人民共和國中央政權機關或者特區政權機關等，涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》第二十二條『顛覆國家政權罪』，警方遂依法向法院申請拘捕令，並通緝有關人士。」

「《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》下的罪行訂有適當的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區一致。香港警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛藏英國等西方國家的潛逃者被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，肆意勾結外部勢力包庇其惡行。警方採取一切合法措施，強烈打擊有關潛逃行為，做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。」

「根據《聯合國憲章》為基礎的國際法及國際關係，每個國家都會制定維護國家安全法律，這既是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。在維護國家安全方面的法律，英國就最少有14部。英國卻對香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制指手畫腳，全然漠視香港特區訂立相關法律的憲制責任和實際需要，以及在維護國家安全的相關法律訂立後，對經濟發展和人權保障所帶來的正面效果，是實實在在的雙重標準。」

發言人指︰「任何危害國家安全的人士不要以為身處境外便可逃避刑事責任、逍遙法外。特區政府必會用盡所有方法，依法追捕及打擊潛逃境外危害國家安全的罪犯，全力做到『違法必究，雖遠必誅』。特區政府呼籲被通緝人士懸崖勒馬，回港自首，不要一錯再錯。」

「就移交逃犯方面，根據中央人民政府的指示，特區政府已於二○二○年七月暫停港英移交逃犯協定，至今未變。一直以來，特區政府在中央人民政府的授權和協助下，以互助互惠原則，依法與其他司法管轄區進行執法合作及司法互助。特區政府會一如既往適當處理相關事宜。」

發言人強調︰「特區政府會繼續堅定不移地履行維護國家安全的責任，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府強烈要求英國政府立即停止干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」"

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-26 12:00,2025-07-26 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600354.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

Reporter: Can you explain the rationale behind splitting ""Sha Ta"" into two sub-districts? How will this improve service efficiency? How will the additional new teams in Sheung Shui Rural and Hang Hau West specifically address the needs of the growing population of those areas? And my second question is, what does regularising the care teams mean for their future, and have you envisioned their roles in the community involving?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: As I said, we have assessed the service coverage and the demographic changes in each sub-district, we can see that the population of certain districts have increased, so we have increased two care teams to cater for the demographic changes. We have also examined and assessed the service coverage of the care teams, one specific team is in Sha Tau Kok and Ta Kwu Ling, so we have separated the two teams in the districts. So the number of care teams have been increased from 452 to 455, after our assessment on the demographic changes and the service coverage of each care team. This is to provide better services for our residents.

This is the latest figure as of the end of the second quarter, in the first term of the service, the care teams have visited about 530 000 elderly households and other households in need, and provided about 76 000 times of basic home or other support services, and organised about 38 000 district-level activities. So you can see, our care team members are very devoted and dedicated to community services, they are all volunteers, and they use their own time to serve the community. Last week, during the time of the typhoon, our care team members were also on standby at the shelters and in the districts to help our residents. I expect that in the second term, we can enhance our service and serve our community better. We have three directions in serving the community in the second term of the service. We plan to optimise the service in three key directions, the first one is for seamless continuity, and this is to provide our residents with continued service, we do not want to see any discrepancy or suspension in the service. We also want our service to be able to cater for the district needs. The third one is to deepen and broaden our service coverage, so that residents can be better served by the care teams.

民政及青年事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容,2025-07-26 11:47,2025-07-26 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600317.htm,"​以下是民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（七月二十六日）出席電台節目後會見傳媒的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長：大家好，正如我剛才在節目中提及，關愛隊在二○二三年第三季全面起動到現在已經一年多了，我們已向第一期服務協議的承辦團體發出邀請，邀請他們繼續營運第二期的關愛隊，過程中我們亦檢視了關愛隊現在的服務範圍，所以我們會由現在的452隊關愛隊增加到455隊關愛隊。增加的是甚麼呢？就是有一個區，譬如是以前的「沙打」，即沙頭角和打鼓嶺，它的幅員很廣的，所以我們會將這個區一分為二。另外在北區和西貢也會在各區增加一隊關愛隊，這是因應人口增加的需要。同時有六個區亦因應它們的服務範圍做了一些微調，例如有些大廈，一條邨內有幾棟大廈在另外一個關愛隊的服務範圍，我們作出調整，讓大家在提供服務的時候更歸一，亦方便關愛隊可以更好地接觸市民。

在第二期服務的工作上，我們希望在服務協議落實的時候有三個方向，第一，我們一定要確保現在提供給市民的關愛隊服務是得以延續的，即不可以在中途中斷；第二就是要按照區情和區需去提供服務；第三是希望在第一期服務的基礎上，可以在第二期的服務能夠做得更深和更廣。現在我們會邀請第一期的承辦團體開展第二期的服務協議，但是因為我們現在新增了三隊，畢竟關愛隊也是一個義工服務，承辦團體未必一定願意再做第二期，所以如果有一些區，例如這三個新區和其他區，原本的承辦團體可能因其他原因而不做，我們就會邀請在第一期經過遴選的團體，讓他們遞交計劃書，申請服務新開的關愛隊。

記者：對於第一期的工作有沒有甚麼感覺，有否特別想提醒他們具體一點要改善的地方？剛剛提到有些義工團隊未必願意做第二期，想看看現在會否有退出的數字？

民政及青年事務局局長︰我剛剛在電台節目都提及了關愛隊最新的服務數字，截至今年第二季，即是六月底，最新的數字就是探訪了約53萬個長者戶和有需要住戶，提供了約76 000次的服務，舉辦了約38 000次活動，你看到這些數字，我們關愛隊的工作，他們都是按着目標和各項的工作指標完成，甚至大家看到其實很多隊都是超標完成。

過去這幾個月，在研究和調研關於關愛隊的工作時，我們在各區都參與了一些分享會，聽他們說其工作經驗。我覺得關愛隊的工作，他們作為義工，真的很投入去服務社區。有些情況大家可以見到的，譬如在一個社區裏，出現一些大規模的停電或停水，關愛隊可以馬上動員，協助市民。你試想在氣溫三十多度，像現在的天氣下突然停電，關愛隊隊員跑上三十幾層樓，為一些獨居長者送飯或送水，所以你看到關愛隊的工作。早前的颱風，在十號風球情況下，有長者家中的窗戶墮下，與長者不同住的子女感到擔心，但十號風球下又不能去探望他們，他們便找當區的關愛隊，請關愛隊去看看他們媽媽的情況。關愛隊也聯絡到同區的義工，在安全的情況下探望長者。長者見到有人幫忙，立刻感到安心多了，為她解決了因窗戶墮下而引致的「撇水」，幫她封好窗戶，解決問題，所以其實你看到關愛隊的工作很投入。

如果你說我有甚麼想提醒他們呢？那就是提他們要注意安全，因為他們工作的時候往往都是非常投入。我上次見到關愛隊，他們告訴我在十號風球時的工作，我也提醒他們要注意安全，因為我知道大家都很投入做義工服務。他們一接到電話，或收到求助就立即去幫忙。在早前的十號風球下，其實很明顯看到關愛隊所發揮的作用。很多不與父母同住的子女聯絡關愛隊尋求協助，希望關愛隊可以幫忙照顧到他們的父母。因為他們不同住，在颱風期間不能去探望他們。在關愛長者及社區方面，關愛隊發揮了很大的作用。

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-26 06:50,2025-07-26 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600166.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 26) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

DH ramps up health education on prevention and control measures against Chikungunya fever amid global surge (with photos),2025-07-25 19:51,2025-07-25 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500817.htm,"  A surge in Chikungunya fever (CF) has been reported in different countries and regions worldwide. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (July 25) that it will continue to implement a multipronged approach to prevent the spread of CF in Hong Kong and safeguard public health. The CHP will hold two online seminars next week. Doctors will explain the symptoms of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents. The seminars aim to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others.

""CF is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of female Aedes mosquitoes carrying the CF virus, and is not transmitted from person to person. The recent spike in CF cases in multiple regions worldwide poses a significant risk of imported cases in Hong Kong. When it comes to CF, the saying 'prevention is better than cure' is absolutely applicable. Although there is currently no registered vaccine in Hong Kong to prevent CF, avoiding mosquito bites and curbing mosquito breeding can create an effective barrier to prevent the local spread of the disease. To this end, the CHP has increased its public awareness and educational efforts targeting different groups and will continue to work closely with various government departments and stakeholders to enhance preparedness and readiness,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Dr Tsui added that CF can easily lead to large-scale outbreaks in environments with severe mosquito infestations, placing a burden on the healthcare system. While most CF patients have mild symptoms, the elderly, young children and those with underlying illnesses are more likely to develop complications after becoming infected. After recovery, patients may experience long-term joint pain, which can persist for months or even years, causing inconvenience or distress to their daily lives. Therefore, CF should not be taken lightly.

Control measures at boundary control points (BCPs)

  The CHP's Port Health Division steps up publicity and education efforts regarding CF at the BCPs, conducts more frequent inspections to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, conducts temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fevers or related symptoms will be assessed on health conditions and referred to hospitals for follow up when necessary. The CHP also maintains close liaison with relevant stakeholders such as airlines and the travel industry to provide the latest disease information and health advice in a timely manner.

Reminder to healthcare professionals to report CF cases

  Today, the CHP issued another letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong regarding CF to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel. If CF cases are detected, they should be immediately referred to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures.

Measures the public should continue to take

The CHP will hold two online seminars next week to raise public awareness of CF and address related inquiries from the public. Details will be announced later on the CHP's social media accounts, and the public is welcome to watch. Starting from today, the CHP has also set up mobile promotional booths at multiple locations across Hong Kong (including public markets, community health centres, and shopping malls) to educate the public on how to prevent mosquito-borne diseases. Details can be viewed at www.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html.

The CHP recommends that the public properly use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients to effectively prevent mosquito bites. The following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


Latest global situation regarding CF

There have been no CF cases in Hong Kong since 2020.

According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of early June this year, over 220 000 cases had been reported in 14 countries/regions worldwide (including the Mainland, Taiwan and Singapore which are popular tourist destinations for Hong Kong citizens). Of these cases, about 80 were fatal. Around one third of the population of La Réunion were currently estimated to be infected with CF, and cases were reported in Europe (including France and Italy).

In July this year, an outbreak of CF occurred in Shunde District of Foshan City, Guangdong Province, triggered by imported cases. As of July 24, there were 3 645 CF confirmed cases in Foshan. The majority of cases (3 317 cases) were in Shunde District; 178 cases in Chancheng District; 141 cases in Nanhai District; six in Sanshui District and three in Gaoming District. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases so far. Regarding Macao, the first and second CF cases this year were recorded on July 18 and 22 respectively. The patients travelled to Shunde and Nanhai respectively during the incubation period and was classified as imported cases.

  ""Although Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for spreading CF, is not found in Hong Kong, Aedes albopictus is another vector that can transmit CF. Imported cases of CF and dengue fever can lead to local transmission if they are bitten by mosquitoes during the communicable period. Mosquitoes breed quickly during the hot, rainy spring and summer months.Inadequate mosquito control also poses a risk of CF outbreaks. Mosquito control is of paramount importance, including eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene,mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Scientific research showed that even asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected individuals can transmit the virus to mosquitoes through bites. Members of the public returning from areas affected by CF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor,"" said Dr Tsui.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the dengue fever page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service,the Chikungunya fever page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."

僱主僱員應訂立暴雨警告下的工作安排,2025-07-25 19:47,2025-07-25 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500906.htm,"勞工處今日（七月二十五日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在暴雨警告下及極端情況及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以保障僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主應預先制定合理而可行的工作安排和應變措施。在擬訂及執行有關安排時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮當中的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在暴雨警告或極端情況下及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-07-25 19:47,2025-07-25 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500904.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (July 25) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

​香港海關新蒲崗搗破兩個懷疑私煙及另類吸煙產品貯存倉庫（附圖）,2025-07-25 19:20,2025-07-25 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500822.htm,"香港海關昨日（七月二十四日）在新蒲崗搗破兩個懷疑私煙及另類吸煙產品貯存倉庫，共檢獲約六十五萬支懷疑私煙及約七十二萬支懷疑另類吸煙產品，估計市值共約五百二十萬元，私煙應課稅值約二百一十五萬元，並拘捕一名涉案人士。

海關人員昨日下午在新蒲崗進行反私煙行動，在六合街一座工業大廈內截查一名可疑男子，於其手推車上檢獲約一萬支懷疑另類吸煙產品，遂拘捕該名報稱建築工人的二十歲男子。其後，海關人員押解他到該工廈內的兩個單位進行搜查，並再檢獲約六十五萬支懷疑私煙及約七十一萬支懷疑另類吸煙產品。

經初步調查，海關相信檢獲的私煙及另類吸煙產品主要以電話訂購方式供應東九龍一帶。案件仍在調查中，不排除有更多人被捕。

海關自七月初起，在全港各區展開代號「迅雷」的執法行動，打擊電話訂購私煙活動，包括私煙貯存倉庫、零售黑點及街頭販賣。海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。

海關強調買賣私煙同屬違法。根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Hong Kong Customs raided two suspected illicit cigarette and alternative smoking product storage centres in San Po Kong (with photo),2025-07-25 19:20,2025-07-25 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500823.htm,"Hong Kong Customs shut down two suspected illicit cigarette and alternative smoking product storage centres in San Po Kong yesterday (July 24), seizing a total of about 650 000 suspected illicit cigarettes and about 720 000 suspected alternative smoking products, with a total estimated market value of about $5.2 million. The duty potential of the illicit cigarettes was about $2.15 million. One person involved in the case was arrested.

Customs officers conducted an anti-illicit cigarette operation in San Po Kong yesterday afternoon and intercepted a suspicious man in an industrial building on Luk Hop Street. About 10 000 suspected alternative smoking products were seized from his trolley, and the 20-year-old man, who claimed to be a construction worker, was subsequently arrested. Later, Customs officers escorted the man to two units at the industrial building for a search and further seized about 650 000 suspected illicit cigarettes and about 710 000 suspected alternative smoking products.

After preliminary investigations, Customs believed that the illicit cigarettes and alternative smoking products seized would mainly be used to supply areas in Kowloon East through telephone ordering. The investigation of the case is still ongoing, and the likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.
â
Hong Kong Customs has been mounting a territory-wide enforcement operation codenamed ""Thunder"" since early July to combat illicit cigarette telephone-ordering activities, including illicit cigarette storage centres, black spots and peddling. Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that it is an offence to buy or sell illicit cigarettes. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-07-25 19:11,2025-07-25 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500836.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (July 25) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

基孔肯雅熱全球肆虐　衞生署加強防控教育（附圖）,2025-07-25 18:50,2025-07-25 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500746.htm,"基孔肯雅熱在全球多個國家和地區肆虐，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十五日）表示，會繼續多管齊下，預防基孔肯雅熱傳入並在本港傳播，保障市民健康。中心下星期會舉行兩場網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的病徵、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等，以期加深市民對這種蚊傳疾病的認識，一同參與防控工作，護己護人。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「基孔肯雅熱主要透過帶有基孔肯雅熱病毒的雌性伊蚊叮咬而傳染給人類，並不會人傳人。基孔肯雅熱近期在全球多個地區錄得的案例急升，來勢洶洶，香港出現輸入個案的風險相當高。『預防勝治療』絕對適合套用於應對基孔肯雅熱。本港現時雖然沒有獲註冊的預防基孔肯雅熱疫苗，但避免蚊叮及蚊子滋生可築起有效的預防屏障，避免該病在本港傳播。就此，中心已加強對不同群組的宣傳教育，亦會繼續與不同政府部門及持份者通力合作，嚴陣以待。」

徐樂堅醫生補充，基孔肯雅熱在蚊患嚴重的環境很容易出現大規模爆發，對醫療系統構成負擔。雖然基孔肯雅熱患者病情大多輕微，但長者、幼童和長期病患者感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症。痊癒後亦有機會出現長期關節痛，情況可以持續數月以至數年，對患者生活帶來不便甚至困擾，所以不應掉以輕心。

口岸的防控工作

中心港口衞生科已在各個口岸加強有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作；加強巡查四周確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施；為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。中心亦會與航空公司和旅遊業界等持份者保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議。

提醒醫護人員呈報

中心今日再次就基孔肯雅熱去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。

市民應繼續採取的措施

中心下星期會舉行兩場網上講座，喚起公眾對基孔肯雅熱的關注和回應市民的相關查詢，詳情稍後會於中心的社交媒體帳號公布，歡迎市民收看。中心亦已在全港多個不同地點（包括公共街市、地區康健中心及商場）設置流動宣傳攤位，教育公眾如何預防蚊子傳播的疾病，詳情可瀏覽www.chp.gov.hk/tc/other/events/476.html 。

中心建議市民使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


基孔肯雅熱在全球的最新情況

本港由二○二○年至今，沒有錄得確診基孔肯雅熱的個案。

世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱個案。截至今年六月初，全球14個國家／地區共錄得超過22萬宗個案（包括內地、台灣、新加坡等香港人的旅遊熱點），當中約80宗為死亡個案。近期留尼汪島約三分之一的人口估計感染了基孔肯雅熱，而歐洲（包括法國及意大利）亦出現個案。

廣東佛山市順德區今年七月出現基孔肯雅熱爆發情況，由外地輸入個案引起，截至七月二十四日，佛山市錄得3 645宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，絕大部分（3 317宗）出現在順德區；另外禪城區有178宗、南海區有141宗、三水區有六宗及高明區有三宗。所有患者症狀輕微，暫時沒有錄得嚴重或死亡個案。澳門方面，當局於七月十八日及七月二十二日錄得當地今年首宗及第二宗基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，患者於潛伏期分別到過順德區和南海區。

徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然香港目前未有發現主要傳播基孔肯雅熱的埃及伊蚊，但白紋伊蚊亦可以傳播基孔肯雅熱。基孔肯雅熱及登革熱的輸入個案如在傳染期被蚊子叮咬，有機會導致本地傳播。炎熱多雨的春夏月份有利蚊子迅速繁殖，如控蚊成效不足，便有爆發蚊傳疾病的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防蚊傳疾病的最佳方法。科學研究顯示，即使沒有病徵或尚未出現病徵的感染者被蚊叮咬，亦有機會把病毒傳給蚊子。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

登革熱最新情況,2025-07-25 18:30,2025-07-25 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500750.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十五日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，夏季伴隨著高溫及多雨，本港蚊患情況預料會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往登革熱流行地區，因此本地登革熱的風險正在上升。

由七月十八日至昨日（七月二十四日），中心錄得三宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾到印度尼西亞、斯里蘭卡及泰國。

截至昨日，今年錄得33宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。二○二三年則錄得62宗外地傳入個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過二萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過2 900宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得140宗本地感染病例，於七月七日至十三日的一周內已錄得51宗，其中以廣州、中山、佛山和潮州錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

徐樂堅醫生補充：「本港經常有外地傳入的登革熱個案，每年間中亦有零星的本地登革熱個案。由於香港存在白紋伊蚊，本地市民有機會受感染。炎熱多雨的季節有利蚊子迅速繁殖。如控蚊成效不足，更有爆發登革熱的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防登革熱的最佳方法。市民如從受登革熱影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

市民應繼續採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


​含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%＊；

Update on dengue fever,2025-07-25 18:30,2025-07-25 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500751.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (July 25) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases. The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminded the public that during the summer months with high temperature and heavy rainfall, the mosquito infestation is expected to aggravate in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public will travel to DF-endemic regions more frequently during the summer holiday. Therefore, the risk of DF in Hong Kong is increasing.

  From July 18 to yesterday (July 24), the CHP recorded three imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand during the incubation period.

As of yesterday, 33 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases. In 2023, 62 imported cases of DF were recorded.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore also recorded over 2 900 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 140 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 51 cases were recorded in a week between July 7 and 13, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Foshan and Chaozhou.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

  ""There have been frequent imported cases of dengue fever in Hong Kong, as well as occasional sporadic local cases every year. The presence of Aedes albopictus in Hong Kong makes our population vulnerable. Mosquitoes breed quickly during the hot and rainy summer months. There are risks of DF outbreaks if mosquito control is inadequate. Hence, mosquito control is of paramount importance. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. The public is reminded that eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are key to preventing DF. Those returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor,"" Dr Tsui added.

  Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.


âDEET-containing insect repellents are effective and the public should take heed of the tips below:


Read the label instructions carefully first;
Apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
Apply on exposed skin and clothing;
Use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children*;
Apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent; and
Reapply only when needed and follow the instructions.

* For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."
GREEN$ Electronic Participation Incentive Scheme to be fully digitalised (with photos),2025-07-25 18:25,2025-07-25 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500711.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) announced today (July 25) that, along with technological advancements, the GREEN$ Electronic Participation Incentive Scheme (GREEN$ ePIS) will be fully digitised on April 1, 2026. The digitalisation will enhance the connections of GREEN$ ePIS with more reward platforms and gift redemption locations in the market. Members of the public will no longer be required to visit GREEN@COMMUNITY to redeem a limited selection of around 10 types of gifts. Instead, they can redeem their favourite or required gifts at more than 500 supermarkets and retail stores, as well as free MTR tickets and local ecotours, through the GREEN$ mobile app.

  The EPD spokesperson said, ""Among the approximately 1.06 million current users of GREEN$ ePIS, about 920 000 users (i.e. 87 per cent), are already using the mobile app, allowing them to transition seamlessly to full digitisation. To encourage physical card users to switch to the GREEN$ mobile app promptly and enjoy the benefits of digitalisation, the EPD will launch a summer promotion to offer an extra 50 GREEN$ points to those who return their physical cards and switch to the use of the GREEN$ mobile app during the period from August 1 to September 30, 2025.""

  All the facilities of GREEN@COMMUNITY will post notices to inform the public of the arrangements. The public will have time to adapt and transition to the new arrangements, with physical gifts remaining available for redemption at GREEN@COMMUNITY until the first quarter of 2026. Physical cards will cease operation on April 1, 2026. Staff of GREEN@COMMUNITY will assist the public in installing the GREEN$ mobile app, and demonstrate how to use the e-point redemption feature. For the few people without smartphones, their existing physical cards will not be cancelled. They can register their cards at designated facilities of GREEN@COMMUNITY and continue to use the GREEN$ points in the physical cards for redeeming gifts.

Time-saving and convenient with more choices

  The five most popular gifts at GREEN@COMMUNITY in the past years have been daily necessities including rice, cooking oil, toilet paper, and soy milk (see Annex for details). These popular items can all be redeemed using GREEN$ points after being converted into MoneyBack points at over 500 supermarkets and retail stores across the city. The GREEN$ mobile app also allows users to redeem points from the MTR's carbon emission reduction reward platform Carbon Walletfor free MTR tickets and local ecotours.

  Members of the public can continue to donate GREEN$ points to charitable organisations after the full digitisation. The EPD will follow up with the concerned charitable organisations on the arrangements for redemption of e-rewards following the digitisation.

  The e-reward redemption option has been well received by the public since its launch. Following the introduction of the MoneyBack redemption function in December 2024, the monthly GREEN$ points used to redeem MoneyBack points have grown over two times from 7 million points last December to 24 million points in May this year, with about 28 000 users enjoying the MoneyBack point conversion feature (see Annex for details).

  As the e-reward redemption option is currently in its initial trial phase, a redemption limit (3,000 points per account each month) is set to allow more users to try out the new e-reward redemption option. The EPD is planning to introduce more e-reward platforms for point conversions within this year to provide the public with more choices, and the current monthly redemption limit will be lifted progressively.

  The service contracts for Carbon Wallet and MoneyBack were awarded through open tender processes. Service providers participating in the bidding submitted quotations based on their respective costs and other commercial considerations. The service contracts encompass the provision of e-points for conversion and other related services (including promotions, technical support for reward platforms and customer service etc).

Smart city, smart recycling

  With years of efforts by the EPD and support from the public, GREEN$ ePIS has gradually evolved from an incentive scheme into a platform that facilitates collaborative efforts from various sectors of society to promote green waste reduction and a recycling culture. It has successfully mobilised the public to participate in waste separation, recycling as well as fostering recycling habits, driving the quantity of recyclables collected by GREEN@COMMUNITY at the same time. In 2024, about 41 800 tonnes of recyclables (excluding food waste) were collected at GREEN@COMMUNITY, an increase by nearly 60 per cent compared to 2023, while in the first half of 2025, about 22 700 tonnes (excluding food waste) were collected, representing a further increase of about 20 per cent compared to the same period last year. (see Annex for details)

  The spokesperson said, ""Through relentless efforts, the current-term Government has successfully reversed the long-standing trend of increasing waste volume and declining recycling rates in Hong Kong. The GREEN$ mobile app was also awarded the Google Play Hong Kong 'Best App for Good' award in 2024. We look forward to collaborating with all individuals and organisations supporting waste reduction and recycling to further promote GREEN$ ePIS, working together to further enhance Hong Kong's culture of green waste reduction and recycling."""

本院一名耳鼻喉科病人於五月二十六日接受手術期間，獲安排置入鼻胃喉供手術後輸注藥物及營養奶。病人手術後入住深切治療科病房接受緊密監察，並獲安排X光檢查確認鼻胃喉位置，惟醫生其後未有檢視有關X光影像。護士其後為病人進行胃液酸鹼值測試後，按照所得讀數及既定準則，並跟從醫生指示用鼻胃喉為病人輸注藥物及營養奶。醫護人員隨後再為病人檢查時，懷疑鼻胃喉位置偏離，隨即停止輸注及移除鼻胃喉。有關病人臨床情況持續改善，已於六月底出院。

本院於五月三十日公布事件及成立根源分析委員會展開調查。委員會經調查後認為，導致今次事件的主要原因是深切治療科缺乏一套閉環機制，確保在病人進行鼻胃喉輸注前，先檢視X光影像以確認鼻胃喉的位置。

委員會認為事件亦涉及其他因素，包括臨床交接程序中，未有涵蓋X光影像的檢視情況，導致交接的醫療團隊均未有察覺X光影像沒有被檢視；缺乏機制提醒醫生跟進未檢視的X光影像；此外，病人胃液樣本的酸鹼值讀數與胃液的酸鹼值吻合，亦令醫護人員誤以為鼻胃喉被置入正確位置。

委員會提出以下改善建議：

1. 於深切治療科設立閉環機制，提示醫護人員為病人進行鼻胃喉輸注前必須檢視X光影像以確認喉管位置；

2. 將檢視X光影像列為臨床交接及術後早期檢查清單的恆常項目，確保為深切治療科病人輸注前以X光影像確認鼻胃喉位置；

3. 在深切治療科的電子臨床資訊系統中，加入確認鼻胃喉位置作為標準化紀錄；

4. 檢視及更新相關護理臨床指引；及

5. 安排深切治療科醫護人員參與優化醫療團隊管理模擬訓練，加強溝通、團隊合作、情境意識及決策。

本院會跟進及落實執行有關建議，並已聯絡病人及家屬解釋調查結果，再次向他們致歉，醫院病人關係組會繼續為家屬提供所需協助。

本院已向醫院管理局（醫管局）總辦事處呈交報告，謹向根源分析委員會所有成員致謝，委員會名單如下︰

United Christian Hospital announces root cause analysis report of previous incident involving insertion of nasogastric tube,2025-07-25 17:46,2025-07-25 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500707.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for United Christian Hospital (UCH) today (25 July) announced the root cause analysis report of an incident involving the insertion of a nasogastric tube.

A patient, under the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of UCH, underwent surgery on May 26, during which a nasogastric tube was inserted to facilitate postoperative administration of medication and feeding of formula milk. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for close monitoring after the surgery and was arranged for an X-ray examination to verify the position of the nasogastric tube. However, the X-ray image was not reviewed by a doctor afterwards. The nurse then performed a pH test on the gastric aspirate from the patient's nasogastric tube and began nasogastric tube feeding for the patient with drugs and formula milk according to the pH test result, established protocols, and the doctor's order. Healthcare staff later reviewed the patient and suspected that there was a malposition of the nasogastric tube. Feeding was terminated, and the nasogastric tube was removed immediately. The patient's clinical condition continued to improve, and the patient was discharged in late June.

UCH announced the incident on May 30 and appointed a Root Cause Analysis Panel for investigation. After reviewing the case, the Panel concluded that the main cause leading to the incident was the lack of a closed-loop mechanism in the ICU to ascertain that X-ray images were reviewed to verify the position of the nasogastric tube before initiating nasogastric tube feeding for patients.

The Panel believed that the incident also involved other contributing factors, including the X-ray images' review status not being incorporated into the clinical handover process, which led to clinical teams involved not noticing that the X-ray images had not been reviewed; and the lack of a mechanism to alert doctors to follow up on the unreviewed X-ray images. Moreover, the pH test result from the patient's gastric aspirate sample was consistent with the pH reading of gastric fluid, which led the clinical team to mistakenly believe that the nasogastric tube was in the right position.

The Panel made the following recommendations:

1. Establish a closed-loop mechanism in the ICU to alert clinical teams to review X-ray images to ascertain the position of the tube before initiating nasogastric tube feeding for patients;

2. Incorporate X-ray image review into the clinical handover process and postoperative checklist to ensure that X-ray images are reviewed to ascertain the position of the nasogastric tube before initiating nasogastric tube feeding for ICU patients;

3. Utilise electronic Clinical Information System in the ICU to standardise the clinical documentation of nasogastric tube position;

4. Review and update relevant nursing clinical guidelines; and

5. Arrange ICU healthcare staff to attend Crew Resources Management simulation training for improving team communication, teamwork, situational awareness and decision making.

UCH will take follow-up actions to implement the recommendations. The hospital has explained the report's findings to the patient and family concerned and expressed its apology again to them. Patient Relations Team shall continue to provide necessary assistance to the family.

The report has been submitted to the Hospital Authority (HA) Head Office. The hospital expressed gratitude for the work of the Root Cause Analysis Panel. The membership of the panel is as follows:

Chairperson:

Dr Victor Ip
Service Director (Quality & Safety), Kowloon East Cluster, HA

"Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected controlled cosmetic injections worth about $76,000 (with photo)",2025-07-25 17:46,2025-07-25 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500722.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on July 16 and 17 seized 249 pieces of suspected controlled cosmetic injections with an estimated market value of about $76,000. Some of the seized cosmetic injections were suspected to contain Part 1 poisons.

Through risk assessment, Customs on July 16 inspected an express parcel, declared as carrying body lotion, imported from Korea to Hong Kong via the Shenzhen Bay Control Point. Upon inspection, Customs officers found 20 cosmetic injection vials suspected to contain Part 1 poisons in the parcel.

After a follow-up investigation, Customs officers conducted a controlled delivery operation the following day (July 17) at the consignee's address in Hung Hom and arrested two persons suspected to be connected with the case: a 20-year-old man who collected the parcel and a 45-year-old female consignee. Two hundred and twenty-nine pieces of suspected controlled cosmetic injections, some of which were suspected to contain Part 1 poisons, with an estimated market value of about $59,000, were further seized at the consignee's address.

An investigation is ongoing, and the arrested persons have been released on bail pending further investigation.

Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction. Any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for two years.

Under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance, any person who possesses any poison included in Part 1 of the Poisons List other than in accordance with provisions commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected violation of the above-mentioned ordinances to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
衞生防護中心公布新增一宗類鼻疽個案,2025-07-25 17:45,2025-07-25 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500607.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（七月二十五日）表示，過去一星期（七月十八日至二十四日），中心錄得一宗新增類鼻疽個案。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的62歲男子。他居於深水埗，在七月十四日出現腹部不適和食慾不振，七月十六日到明愛醫院求診，同日入院接受治療。他留院期間出現發燒，並被診斷有肺炎。他的血液樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。病人於七月二十三日因肺炎及本身長期病患去世。病人於二○二二年四月亦曾確診類鼻疽，入院治療後已康復，不排除是次為復發感染。

中心正調查個案的感染源頭和進行流行病學調查。

截至七月二十四日，本港今年錄得八宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"
CHP announces new melioidosis case,2025-07-25 17:45,2025-07-25 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/25/P2025072500608.htm," The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (July 25) announced that one new melioidosis case was recorded in the past week (July 18 to 24).

 The case involves a 62-year-old male with underlying medical conditions. He resided in Sham Shui Po, and developed abdominal discomfort and poor appetite on July 14. He attended Caritas Medical Centre on July 16 and was admitted for treatment on the same day. During his hospitalisation, he developed a fever and was diagnosed with pneumonia. His blood specimen tested positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei. He passed away on July 23 due to pneumonia and underlying medical conditions. He was previously diagnosed with melioidosis in April 2022 and had recovered after hospitalisation. The possibility of a relapsed infection could not be excluded.

 The CHP is investigating the infection source of the case. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

 As of July 24, eight melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

 Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

 â
 âThe CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.
