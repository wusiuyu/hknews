Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-27 17:30,2025-12-27 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/27/P2025122700414.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 27), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10 of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

The event this year is themed on artificial intelligence, with an aim of promoting professional exchanges and co-operation among Chinese education practitioners from across the country and overseas through interaction and sharing to achieve the goal of mutual learning for joint development.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the event, Dr Choi emphasised that teachers, as pioneers of a learning society, need to continuously strengthen themselves and collaborate for progress. At present, new technologies such as artificial intelligence are reshaping the form of education. It is imperative for teachers to not only keep abreast of the times, but also grasp technological changes and enhance their professional capabilities.

  She said, ""In alignment with the national strategies for digital education and artificial intelligence, the Education Bureau has been proactively working along four directions, namely, enhancing students' digital literacy and skills; strengthening professional training on digital education for teachers; optimising digital education ancillary infrastructure; and strengthening ties among local, Mainland and international innovation and technology institutions, tertiary institutions and relevant sectors for greater synergy.""

Dr Choi also pointed out that for more than 30 years, the event has built a cross-regional and cross-cultural professional platform which enables teachers to learn from each other, and develop together to explore and innovate. She hoped this platform can further promote and deepen co-operation among teachers from all over the nation in fostering the development of high quality education together, with a view to providing talent support for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and contributing to building the nation into a leading country in education.

Dr Choi will continue her visit in Guangxi tomorrow (December 28)."

The Independent Committee in relation to the fire has commenced work to examine the causes and circumstances that led to the fire and its rapid spread, construction safety and related issues concerning building maintenance and renovation works, as well as the systemic problems related to the tendering process of large-scale building maintenance and renovation works. The Government will proactively facilitate the investigation work.

 Moreover, the three task forces set up by the Government for the fire - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - have been following up on the relevant work. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
--------------------
ãã
 Different sectors of the Hong Kong community have participated in relief support and donations, contributing essential resources and morale for post-disaster reconstruction and social recovery. As of noon today (December 26), the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, has received about $3.8 billion in donations. Together with the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $4.1 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The fund launched 11 projects with a total commitment of about $1.2 billion, providing emergency financial support to various groups of people affected by the fire, including all residents, families of the deceased, hospitalised casualties, students, foreign domestic helpers, workers, flat owners, and tenants.

 The Government provides a $100,000 living allowance from the Support Fund to each affected household, while families of each deceased victim are provided with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. All verified cases have been processed so far. In addition, the Government earlier announced three new measures, providing flat owners at Wang Fuk Court with a grant of $100,000; an annual rental grant of $150,000 (to be provided for two years) and a one-off relocation grant of $50,000; as well as a one-off relocation grant of $50,000 for affected tenants. The allowances will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Accommodation support
--------------------

 Currently, there is still a supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer-term accommodation. The transitional housing and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects in different districts can altogether provide around 500 units at the moment. Moreover, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

 As of this morning, a total of 494 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 549 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 591 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the HKHS, or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

 The Transport Department (TD) has been steering public transport operators (PTOs) to strengthen services of franchised buses, green minibuses, and residents' services by deploying additional vehicles and manpower to support residents affected who have been admitted into transitional housing in various districts, facilitating transfers to other services to and from different districts. The TD will closely co-ordinate with operating organisations of transitional housing projects concerned and PTOs to cater for residents' commuting needs.

Relief supplies and donations
--------------------

 The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 2 000 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 51 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Investigation and regulation
--------------------

 Relevant policy bureaux and departments continue to follow up on the fire investigation and regulatory efforts.

Follow-up work
--------------------

 Relevant policy bureaux and departments will continue to follow up on the support and relief work regarding the fire, including providing assistance in finance and welfare, accommodation and supplies, as well as medical, financial and legal support services for affected residents. Enforcement agencies and the Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force are making every effort to pursuethe investigation work related to the fire.

香港社會各界積極參與善後支援和捐獻，為災後重建及社會復原貢獻重要物質和精神力量。截至今日（十二月二十六日）中午，政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」已收到的外界捐款約38億元，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，基金總額約為41億元，會用在協助居民重建家園，是長期和持續的支援。

基金現時已推出11個項目，提供緊急財政支援予不同類別受大火影響的人士，包括：所有住戶、死難者家屬、留院傷者、學生、外籍家庭傭工、工友、業主、租戶，援助金的總承擔額約12億元。

政府從基金向每戶受影響家庭發放10萬元生活津貼，以及就每名死者向家屬發放20萬元慰問金和五萬元殮葬金，目前已處理所有經確認的個案。另外，政府早前宣布推出三項新措施，分別是向宏福苑的業主提供10萬元補助、每年15萬元的租金補助（為期兩年）和一次性五萬元的搬遷補助，以及向受影響的租戶發放一次性五萬元的搬遷補助，政府會陸續發放有關款項。

社會福利署（社署）社工已接觸超過1 980個受影響住戶，為超過4 900名居民提供「一戶一社工」服務。社署會與受影響住戶保持聯繫，為他們提供一切所需協助，並全力支援政府的善後工作。

運輸署督導公共運輸服務營辦商加強專營巴士、專線小巴和居民巴士服務，加派車輛和人手，支援入住各區過渡性房屋的火災居民，便利接駁其他服務往返各區。運輸署會與相關過渡性房屋項目營運機構和公共運輸服務營辦商緊密協調，照顧居民的出行需要。
