勞工及福利局局長就高端人才入境計劃會見傳媒談話內容,2025-08-16 14:22,2025-08-16 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600426.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（八月十六日）上午出席電視台節目訪問後，就高端人才通行證計劃會見傳媒的談話內容：

勞工及福利局局長：早晨各位，看看大家有甚麼問題。

記者：局長，對於有學者指出對高端人才通行證計劃（高才通）的續簽率不太滿意，請問政府對此續簽率是否滿意？有社會聲音認為續簽率較低，請問如何回應？另外，前特首梁振英在社交媒體指政府的考慮不夠長遠，未來七年後人才有機會取得香港永久居民身分，政府有否預計該等人口的數量？梁振英亦指出，其後他們在內地所生的子女亦可獲得香港永久居民身分，政府有否預計未來申請人口對本港醫療、教育和福利的影響？

勞工及福利局局長：首先，昨天我們公布了首批高才通續簽的數字。截至今年七月三十一日，首批一萬三千多宗已經到期的高才通簽證，其續簽率是54%。我們認為是理想的，亦符合預期。高才通推出之初，我們亦講得非常清楚，高才通並非以工作為本，而是以人才為本，讓人才先來港探索機會。若人才認為環境良好、合適，便會選擇留下來，是一個相互選擇的過程。這個既是對香港的一個考驗，對人才而言亦是一個考驗。就54%的申請續簽比率而言，我們覺得是理想的。我們可用英國的類似計劃作參考，他們稱它為Graduate Visa，讓於英國畢業的海外學生留在英國工作。他們的申請續簽率約是46%。事實上，香港的續簽率是稍勝於英國，我們認為這個是相當好的。

另外，在這54%申請續簽的高才中，質素可是相當高的，包括他們的收入或是工作範疇，即是我們最需要的創科、金融、商貿。此外，他們大部分很年輕，50%以上是低於40歲。香港正面對人口老化，我們的勞動人口已經過了高峰。若大家想作參考，本港每年踏入65歲的人口約12萬，同時每年踏入22歲的人口約六萬。一個是踏入「老友記」的年齡，另一個則是踏入大學畢業後適合加入社會工作的年齡。意思是，若我們甚麼都不做，我們每年淨損失的勞動人口是六萬。多了12萬名長者，但只有六萬名年輕人出來工作，我們會損失了六萬勞動人口。所以，如果香港不下工夫，我們的勞動人口會進一步縮減。我們需要針對性地引進可以幫助香港發展的人才。我們有兩個方向，一個是以有工作為本，這是從前專才計劃一直沿用的，人才獲聘後才可來港；另一方面，我們很想讓一些人才來香港探索，即使人才來港後未有工作，基於他自身能力和強大的人際網絡，他或許未必從事一份現成的工作，反之可能會創造新的工種、甚或開創一間全新的公司。過去兩年我們看到這情況在高才通當中是越來越多。我覺得這個是對香港好的。

另外大家會關心，他拿了高才通身分，是不是就成為香港永久居民──並不是這樣的。高才通首兩年的簽證，僅僅是給他一個機會去探索。他要成為香港永久居民，還要再經過兩關。他要經歷兩次的續簽，要有工作或自己成立了有具體業務的公司，才可以通過獲得兩次續簽。因此，他們並非取得高才通第一個簽證後，便等於成為香港永久居民。事實上，他們每位都具備實力，是其他很多城市給予房屋及金錢去爭奪的人才，並不會貿然為了來港而做出他認為對他沒有好處的事。我們看到，會攜帶子女來港的高才，均是有信心和把握獲得續簽，才願意讓子女來港讀書。大家都要將心比己，他在原居地有好學校、讀得很好，貿然來港兩年後，若主申請人未能成功續簽，受養人簽證亦會過期，小朋友便要離開回到原居地，原有的學校是否重新收生亦是未知。我覺得大家都要想想他的安排。我們現在看到的是，會帶小朋友來港讀書的高才都是很有信心，有工作讓他能夠成功續簽，他才來港。

當然長遠而言，香港是不夠年輕人，我們不夠學生。所以，無論他是用高才、專才，或是透過其他種種計劃來港，過去現在都是相同，我們都歡迎他來港。關鍵點是，他要跟從香港的規矩，依法循規。若他來港成為香港一分子，我們應當歡迎，香港一直是個多元開放的城市。我知道大家很關心這課題，所以在高才續簽方面，我們都做得相當仔細，都是一步一步跟進。本地人是一個大基礎盤，在本地人人口基數不足之際──尤其是年輕人口少的時候──我們能通過人才計劃，為我們的經濟發展注入更多動力。

記者：最近留意到，現階段的資助大學入學學額競爭很大，而跟進行家剛剛問到的問題，政府有否預視未來七年後，若本港多了一些高才真正成為永久性居民，在資源方面可以如何支撐未來人口的需求，尤其現時已看到競爭已經開始增大？

勞工及福利局局長：統計署已於前天發表最新中期人口數字，我們看到人口有輕微增長。此增長只是輕微的，正如我之前所說，撇除外來人口，香港每一年死亡人數比出生人數多。若我們如果甚麼都不做，我們人口是會縮少的。正如我所說，每年踏入65歲的人口有約12萬；而踏入22歲的人口則是一半，只有六萬。所以，每年我們淨減六萬勞動力比較強的的勞動人口。而隨着引入人才和其他計劃，人才來港補充了我們的勞動力。我明白大家對於社會的運作都有不同的看法，但希望大家公道地去看，我們每一項制度，無論是教育或種種的社會服務，都是有規有矩的。而且，我們不只是針對高才子女，我們亦安排很多循不同計劃從歐美地區來的人才，我們都一樣為他們提供公平、一致的安排。只要他是跟從香港的規矩，並通過努力實現到自己升學的理想，我覺得大家應該擁有一個公平的跑道。此外，現在香港的教育資源投放其實很大，有很多不同的選擇，讓我們的年輕人可以實現自己的理想。我們會持續關注人才計劃下的大家關心的事項，並進一步去跟進。這次是第一次我們完成續簽並和大家分享數據。將來若有更多數據，我們亦會跟大家分享。

Partial termination of a contract for bottled drinking water for government offices,2025-08-16 13:53,2025-08-16 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600398.htm,"The Government Logistics Department (GLD) stated that it had partially terminated a contract for the supply of bottled drinking water to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands starting from today (August 16).

In June this year, the GLD awarded the contract to Xin Ding Xin Trade Co., Limited (XDX). According to the contract, XDX is to supply bottled drinking water, branded ""XinLe"" and manufactured by æ¨ç¾æ°ï¼å»£æ±ï¼é£²ç¨æ°´æéå¬å¸å»£å·åå¬å¸ (available in Chinese only), to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands starting from late June this year for a period of 36 months.

Having received information on XDX's business operation recently, the GLD was not satisfied that XDX would still be capable of performing the contract, and decided to partially terminate the said contract starting from today (August 16) in accordance with contract terms. The GLD will follow up seriously and take follow-up action including whether to terminate the contract. The GLD has also referred the case to Police for investigation.

To ensure the supply of drinking water, the GLD has arranged for AS Watson Group (HK) Limited to supply bottled drinking water temporarily, branded ""COOL"" and manufactured by the company, to government offices on Hong Kong Island and parts of the outlying islands starting from next week.

The GLD has been monitoring contractual performance of the suppliers of bottled drinking water for government offices, with a view to ensuring stable supply of bottled drinking water in compliance with stipulated technical specifications according to contract terms and ensuring the safety of drinking water. Suppliers are required to submit test reports issued by independent accredited laboratories every two months to prove that the drinking water provided by them complies with the requirements under the technical specifications. The GLD also extracts samples of drinking water for testing from time to time throughout the contract period. In this regard, the GLD has earlier conducted a test of bottled drinking water samples in government offices, which confirmed that the bottled drinking water from all suppliers complied with the safety standards for bottled drinking water.

Following the expiry of the original contracts, the GLD conducted an open tender in March this year to select suitable suppliers of bottled drinking water for government departments. As regards the three successful tenderers and the brands of drinking water to be supplied pursuant to their tenders, the information is set out as follows:

Remarks by SLW on fatal work accident at Siu Ho Wan and Top Talent Pass Scheme,2025-08-16 12:53,2025-08-16 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600363.htm," Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, on the fatal work accident at Siu Ho Wan and the Top Talent Pass Scheme at a media session after attending a radio programme today morning (August 16):

Reporter: Can you comment on the fatal accident at the MTR depot yesterday? Do you view this as an isolated incident or do you believe it warrants a broader examination of MTR's safety protocols and oversight? And my second question is, what future strategies will be implemented to attract more talents to Hong Kong and are there plans to provide clearer pathways to long-term residency for successful Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) applicants, especially for those contributing significantly to the economy? Thank you.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. We are very concerned about the fatal industrial accident happened yesterday. The Labour Department has already issued a suspension order, and also we are looking into the whole accident. At this moment, we do not have anything further to provide, but just to make sure we will look into the whole accident strictly in accordance with our rules and the relevant laws. If there is any body or institution that eventually, through investigation, has to be held accountable for the whole accident, we will pursue in accordance with the law.

  Secondly, on talents, yesterday I shared the latest visa renewal outcome with the public. We are making full use of the whole spectrum of talent admission schemes available to us, including the schemes targeting those already had a job offer before arriving in Hong Kong. And also, for talents under the TTPS, where we only require them to prove either they are high-earners, or graduates from one of the top 100 universities in the world. We are encouraged by the visa renewal outcome of the TTPS. We are going to further step up our promotion, so that we are going to attract more talents to Hong Kong to help us grow our economy. Thank you very much."
文化體育及旅遊局局長出席遊艇旅遊及遊艇經濟圓桌會議的致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-16 12:22,2025-08-16 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600310.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（八月十六日）出席遊艇旅遊及遊艇經濟圓桌會議的致辭全文：

盧偉國主席（香港經濟民生聯盟（經民聯）主席盧偉國）、林建岳主席（香港旅遊發展局主席林建岳）、陸瀚民議員（經民聯立法會議員陸瀚民）、各位來賓、各位好朋友、各位傳媒朋友：

大家早上好！開場白一定是我今日非常高興出席遊艇旅遊及遊艇經濟圓桌會議，與業界翹楚共聚一堂，但是我入到來才發現今日其實真的好像我初上任時所說，我原來是見老朋友、交新朋友。當然在座有些新朋友我今日第一次認識，但是老朋友有很多，包括我以前任職運輸署時的老朋友都到來，有些在我任職房屋署時認識的老朋友又來了，但原來他們都與今日的題目相關。還有一些就是我當年做旅遊事務副專員時已經與我一起並肩作戰的戰友都在座。我這個講辭寫得比較客氣，嚴肅正規，我想今日雖然有傳媒在場，但都是好朋友談談政策，如何做好這個政策，所以我覺得可以稍為輕鬆一點，因為我輕鬆一點，大家稍後發言也可以輕鬆一點，我可以聽到更多真知灼見。

其實遊艇旅遊去年，剛才盧主席也提到，行政長官在《施政報告》中提出，要以創新思維打造香港成為首選旅遊目的地。文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）於去年十二月三十日公布了《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》，當中特別強調要拓展海島旅遊，善用海濱資源。大家都亦聽過中央港澳工作辦公室夏寶龍主任（中央港澳工作辦公室主任、國務院港澳事務辦公室主任夏寶龍）提及過香港的旅遊資源、海島資源非常珍貴，我們應該用好。香港亦是「無處不旅遊」，我們這些本來已有的瑰寶，如何用好它們，是我們要思考的地方。所以致力推動遊艇旅遊成為我們推動高增值旅遊的重要一環。

剛才盧主席也提到，香港有263個島嶼和1 180公里的海岸線，我們的海岸線和島嶼資源是得天獨厚，具備發展遊艇旅遊的天然優勢。非常感謝經民聯提出的七項建議，涵蓋政策、基建、出入境、產業配套等各個方面，為推動香港與大灣區遊艇旅遊，以至其他地方來到香港的遊艇旅遊合作發展提供了寶貴方向。

文體旅局全力支持遊艇旅遊的發展，因為這與拓展和促進香港高增值旅遊活動的政策目標一致。在硬件配套方面，去年《施政報告》提出在三個地點，即香港仔避風塘擴建部分、前南丫石礦場和紅磡站臨海用地增加泊位設施。就香港仔避風塘擴建部分和前南丫石礦場用地，發展局今年較早時候已經邀請市場提交意向書，並正整理及分析蒐集到的意見。至於紅磡站臨海用地，政府早前已公布初步土地用途建議，並進行公眾諮詢。三個項目一共可帶來共近600個遊艇泊位，當早兩個地點更位於較市區的部分，紅磡和香港仔。我知道大家都希望新泊位設施能早日落成，政府的目標與大家是一致的。發展局已公開表示會盡快敲定發展參數和要求，進行各項技術評估和相關法定程序。如項目按傳統模式招標，招標會加快，政府也會積極考慮其他能加快流程的發展模式。

除了由政府主導的項目外，政府亦支持香港機場管理局擴大「機場城市」（SKYTOPIA）的發展，充分利用機場島及香港口岸人工島毗鄰的海域發展遊艇港灣，提供大概500個遊艇泊位及配套設施，並設有多元化的水上休閒及康樂設施；並同時在機場島東岸與港珠澳大橋香港口岸人工島之間的海域內發展機場城市灣畔，提供海灣度假酒店，以及毗鄰大概70個遊艇停泊位置。

當然，要興建遊艇停泊設施，我們需要相關的專業知識，除了碼頭設計外，剛才盧主席也提到，我們不是很多周末下雨，有時更打風下大雨。今早謝展寰局長（環境及生態局局長謝展寰）在電台也略略提到，我們現在在極端天氣頻繁下，很多時做填海和其他工程都要考慮如何設計，讓我們應對極端天氣時更有把握和及早預案。因此，防波堤、水流、電力和供水等設施，我們都很需要研究。

另外與泊位租務有關的議題，因為我們都很重視產業化，若建了泊位但不能提供經濟利益給香港，我想就不是最好的做法。因此，要完全發展用地的商業潛力，提議的遊艇停泊設施也需與岸上的零售、餐飲及娛樂設施結合起來，為訪客提供更多元的旅遊體驗。在發展這些新項目時，整個政府都會與業界保持溝通，務求項目發展能貼近市場需要，滿足真正用家的要求。

要推動遊艇旅遊，除增加遊艇停泊設施以解決泊位不足的問題外，也需要有到位的配套和便利措施配合。剛才盧主席提過的遊艇出入境、船員簽證、以至維修保養等的安排及配套設施都是重要的。就此，我知道業界已經透過不同渠道向政府表達意見。雖然涉及不同政策局和部門的工作，但本屆政府「one Government」、政府一體的原則好好實踐出來，所有相關政策局及部門會積極了解業界對發展遊艇旅遊及相關配套設施的意見和改善建議，考慮推出適切的拆牆鬆綁、便利措施，推動遊艇旅遊。

文體旅局希望隨着遊艇泊位增加，香港可吸引包括大灣區在內和祖國其他港口城市，以至世界各地港口城市的遊艇擁有人都可來到香港。遊艇旅遊有助吸引旅客來港消費和逗留，他們除可在船上欣賞世界著名的維多利亞港和到訪我們二百多個島嶼外，我們更期望他們上岸消費和活動，為香港商戶帶來新商機，亦為香港帶來更大經濟效益。我們會繼續全力支持粵港澳大灣區遊艇旅遊的發展和合作，以拓展和促進香港高增值旅遊活動，發揮香港「一程多站」示範核心區的角色。我們期待與業界和在座各位一同攜手，多用、用好香港美麗多樣的海島資源，讓全球旅客體驗香港近在咫尺的世界級大自然之美。

接下來，我希望聆聽業界在推動遊艇旅遊方面的寶貴意見，謝謝大家。"
暫停政府辦公室樽裝飲用水合約,2025-08-16 11:09,2025-08-16 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/16/P2025081600266.htm,"政府物流服務署（物流署）表示，已由今日（八月十六日）起暫停供應港島和部分離島政府辦公室的樽裝飲用水合約。

物流署今年六月批出合約予鑫鼎鑫商貿有限公司（鑫鼎鑫）。根據合約，鑫鼎鑫由今年六月底起為港島和部分離島的政府辦公室提供由樂百氏（廣東）飲用水有限公司廣州分公司製造的「鑫樂」品牌樽裝飲用水，合約為期36個月。

物流署因應近日取得有關鑫鼎鑫的營運資料，未能信納鑫鼎鑫能繼續履行合約，遂決定根據合約條款由今日（八月十六日）起暫停有關合約。物流署會繼續嚴肅跟進，以採取進一步行動，包括是否終止有關合約。物流署亦已將事件交予警方調查。

為確保飲用水的供應，物流署已安排屈臣氏集團（香港）有限公司在下星期內開始暫時為港島和部分離島政府辦公室供應其製造的「COOL清涼」品牌樽裝飲用水。

物流署一直持續監察政府辦公室樽裝飲用水供應商履行合約的情況，確保供應商按合約條款穩定供應符合指定技術規格的樽裝飲用水以確保飲用水安全。供應商須每兩個月提交由獨立認可實驗室發出的測試報告以證明其提供的飲用水符合技術規格要求，而物流署亦會在合約期內不時抽取飲用水樣本作測試。就此，物流署早前已抽驗政府辦公室樽裝飲用水，證實所有供應商提供的樽裝飲用水均符合樽裝飲用水安全標準。

因應原有合約屆滿，物流署於今年三月透過公開招標，揀選合適供應商為政府部門供應樽裝飲用水。中標的三間公司及按其標書供應的飲用水品牌資料如下：

Lai Chee-ying has been receiving appropriate treatment during his detention,2025-08-15 23:32,2025-08-15 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081501009.htm,"âThe Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (August 15) strongly condemns the out-of-context and fact-twisting reports on the court hearing of the case of Lai Chee-ying made by some foreign media including the US-based Cable News Network (CNN). Such reports attempt to mislead the public into believing that Lai Chee-ying did not receive the medical care he needed, in order to smear Lai Chee-ying's case under the Hong Kong National Security Law, as well as his custodial arrangements and the medical care services provided to him. Their aim to smear and undermine Hong Kong's rule of law is despicable and violates the professional conduct of journalists.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government stressed, ""During today's open court hearing, senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying clearly presented to the court that the correctional institutions arrange daily medical checkups for Lai Chee-ying and that there had been no complaints at all regarding the medical care he receives there. The Court commended the Correctional Services Department (CSD) while the Department of Justice stated that the prosecution is equally concerned about Lai Chee-ying's health and well-being. Therefore, the CSD has arranged for a professional medical team to be on standby on the spot, ready to respond to any emergency immediately if needed. External forces and anti-China media chose to turn a blind eye to these facts, and continued to repeat lies and engage in despicable operations. We must sternly denounce their wrongdoings.

""Before attending court, Lai Chee-ying has been certified by medical doctors that he was physically and mentally fit for court hearing. In fact, doctors stationed at correctional institutions and specialists from the Hospital Authority regularly follow-up on Lai Chee-ying's health conditions. As revealed during the hearing today, in view of Lai Chee-ying's claims of heart palpitations, after a visiting specialist from the Hospital Authority conducted a detailed examination on him on August 7, no abnormality was found. That said, as precaution, the specialist recommended prescribing medication to Lai Chee-ying to be taken as and when needed, and that he should wear a cardiac monitoring device, but Lai Chee-ying declined the advice of the specialist. On August 13, the CSD arranged for another detailed examination by a specialist from the Hospital Authority. The specialist again recommended that Lai Chee-ying wear a device to monitor his cardiac condition, which Lai Chee-ying accepted in the end. The Hospital Authority and the CSD immediately made such arrangements within a short period of time.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""The CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and that an environment with good ventilation, appropriate and timely medical support as well as healthy and nutritious meals are provided. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of persons in custody (PICs) are protected.""

""Facts speak louder than eloquence. The medical care received by Lai Chee-ying in custody is adequate and comprehensive. The CSD supports PICs with medical services provided by the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority. In general, examination and treatment are conducted by medical staff stationed in CSD facilities. Based on the needs of individual PICs, cases will be referred to specialist departments under the Hospital Authority for further follow-up. Hong Kong's medical standards are highly regarded worldwide. Professional medical staff provide the most suitable medical services to patients as soon as possible, and PICs are treated equally. The CSD and relevant units also adopt the above arrangements when handling matters related to Lai Chee-ying, which are no different from those applicable to other PICs,"" the spokesman pointed out."

特區政府發言人強調：「在今日的公開法庭聆訊中，代表黎智英的資深大律師向法庭清楚表明，懲教院所為黎智英每日安排醫療檢查，且對黎智英在懲教院所內獲得的醫療服務沒有任何投訴，法官表示懲教署值得稱讚，而律政司表示控方同樣關心黎智英的健康和福祉，因此懲教署已安排專業的醫療團隊在場隨時待命，準備好即時應對突發情況。外部勢力和反華媒體對這些事實視而不見，繼續重複謊言和作出卑劣操作，我們必須直斥其非。」

「黎智英在出庭前已由醫生再三確定其身心狀況均適合出庭。事實上，駐懲教院所的醫生及醫院管理局專科醫生均定期跟進黎智英的健康狀況。正如今天聆訊中披露，因應黎智英聲稱心悸的情況，醫院管理局到診專科醫生在八月七日為其作詳細檢查後，並無發現異樣，而為了以防萬一，專科醫生當時建議為黎智英處方按需要服食的藥物，以及配戴心臟監測設備，但黎智英拒絕該專科醫生的建議。八月十三日，懲教署安排醫院管理局專科醫生為黎智英再次進行詳細檢查，專科醫生再次建議黎智英配戴設備監測其心臟情況，而黎智英最終接受。醫院管理局和懲教署立即在短時間內作出安排。」

發言人重申：「懲教署一直致力提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供良好的通風環境、合適和及時的醫療支援、健康及營養充足的膳食。懲教署也設有一系列機制，例如透過獨立訪客（即太平紳士）定期巡視的安排，以確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。」

發言人指出：「事實勝於雄辯，黎智英在羈押期間所獲得的醫療服務是完備的。懲教署為在囚人士提供的醫療服務由衞生署及醫院管理局提供，一般的情況會由進駐懲教院所的醫護人員提供檢查及治療，而按個別在囚人士的需要，也會將個案轉介到醫院管理局轄下的專科部門跟進。香港醫療水平在全球享有盛譽，專業的醫護人員會為病人提供最適切的醫療服務，對在囚人士亦一視同仁。懲教署及相關單位處理黎智英相關事宜，均採取上述安排，與其他在囚人士無異。」"

何驥會長（香港紅十字會會長）、劉楚釗醫生（香港紅十字會主席）、陳澤濤副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室協調部副部長）、范鴻齡主席（醫院管理局主席）、各位嘉賓、各位香港紅十字會成員、各位觀眾：

大家晚上好！今日很高興出席舞台劇《第八原則》的啟動禮。

香港紅十字會成立於一九五○年，75年來一直與香港人風雨同路、並肩同行。由戰後援助到救災抗疫，每次危難中紅十字會總能迅速動員，配合政府展開緊急賑災和心理支援工作，以專業無私的服務精神，積極履行作為政府「人道助手」的使命。

今晚上演的《第八原則》舞台劇，是紅十字會和香港話劇團聯手打造的原創劇目，生動展現香港人「患難相扶、同舟共濟」的精神。這份精神既是紅十字會歷任成員堅守的共同信念，更是香港社會一直珍視的核心價值。無論面對天災，或面臨公共衞生危機，大家總是團結一致，以實際行動彰顯人間有情。在困境面前，紅十字會與廣大市民凝聚成一股強大的力量，用愛心和汗水譜寫出無數動人的篇章。

展望未來，香港特區政府與紅十字會的夥伴關係勢必更加緊密。在極端天氣頻生的新時代，紅十字將繼續肩負社區防災的責任。此外，為應對人口老化的挑戰，我期望紅十字會可透過其專業網絡聯絡各界，拓展長者服務，傳承人道精神，攜手建立充滿溫情而又堅韌自強的香港。

我想藉此機會，向所有秉持「第八原則」的人道工作者致敬，並衷心感謝台前幕後團隊，把現實中的人道故事轉化成觸動人心的舞台力量。祝願今晚的演出圓滿順利，大家有一個難忘、愉快的晚上，多謝大家！"

進口商：Ferrarini Pacific Limited

中心發言人說：「中心接獲歐洲聯盟委員會食品和飼料快速預警系統的通報，指上述產品可能受李斯特菌污染，正在法國進行回收。中心得悉事件後，隨即聯絡本地進口商跟進，初步調查發現上述進口商曾進口受影響批次產品。」

相關進口商已按中心指示將受影響批次產品停售及下架。市民可於辦公時間致電相關進口商的熱線查詢，分別為：萬利食品有限公司（電話：2552 7128）；Akiten Limited（電話：2515 0478）；而Ferrarini Pacific Limited亦正展開回收（電話：2573 9800）。

發言人續說：「李斯特菌可在一般烹煮溫度下輕易消滅，但能在冷藏低溫下生存和繁殖。大部分身體健康的人在感染這種細菌後不會出現病徵或只出現輕微病徵如發燒、肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、嘔吐及腹瀉等。但對初生嬰兒、長者和免疫力較低的人，則可能出現嚴重的併發症如敗血症及腦膜炎，甚至死亡。孕婦感染李斯特菌一般症狀輕微，但可導致胎兒流產、夭折、早產，或引致新生嬰兒患上嚴重的感染。」

「為減低感染李斯特菌病的風險，高危人士如孕婦應盡量進食剛煮好的熱食，徹底翻熱冷凍食物，並避免進食或在進食前徹底煮熟高風險食物（即食食物例如凍食肉類、冷燻的海產、軟芝士、沙律等），即使有關食物只屬於一道菜色的一部分。」

發言人說，市民應停止食用受影響產品，如食用有關產品後感到不適，應盡快求醫。

中心會就事件通知業界，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"

  ""The CFS received a notification from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the European Commission that the above-mentioned products are being recalled in France due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately contacted local importers to follow up. A preliminary investigation found that the above-mentioned importers had imported into Hong Kong the affected batches of the products concerned,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

  The importers concerned have stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected batches of the products. Enquiries can be made to the respective importers' hotlines during office hours. They are: Maxly Food Company Limited (Tel: 2552 7128) and Akiten Limited (Tel: 2515 0478). Ferrarini Pacific Limited has initiated a recall (Tel: 2573 9800).

  ""Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicaemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in newborns,"" the spokesman added.

  ""In order to reduce the risk of listeriosis, susceptible populations such as pregnant women should consume freshly prepared hot food where possible, reheat chilled food until it is hot all the way through, and avoid high-risk foods, including ready-to-eat food such as cold cuts, cold smoked seafood, soft cheeses, salads, etc, or cook them thoroughly before consumption, even if they are presented as part of a dish.""

  The spokesman advised members of the public to stop consuming the affected products and seek medical treatment if they feel unwell after consuming the products concerned.

  The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."

​八月份第四批涵蓋兩個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及五個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，除了屯門西及掃管笏，其他都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共四批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共27個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這27個監察區中，有15個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有九區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。至於指數高於10%的地區，包括沙田馬鞍山、屯門掃管笏及屯門西，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。其中，屯門區的誘蚊器數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、學校及私人屋苑，各相關部門及持份者正積極跟進。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該三個地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the fourth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering five survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent, except Tuen Mun West and So Kwun Wat.

The FEHD has so far announced four batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering 27 survey areas. Among these 27 survey areas, 15 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared with the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained at a low level. Nine other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent. As for areas with an index over 10 per cent, including Ma On Shan in Sha Tin, and So Kwun Wat and Tuen Mun West in Tuen Mun, in accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation that strengthens mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20 per cent or above, the department is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. In particular, gravidtrap data for Tuen Mun District showed that the areas with more mosquito problems included parks, schools and private housing estates, and the relevant departments and stakeholders are actively following up. Additionally, the FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap indexes in those three areas to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:


tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest Gravidtrap Index and the Density Index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

In the morning, Mr Yau paid a courtesy call on the Consul-General of the People's Republic of China in Sydney, Mr Wang Yu, to update him on Hong Kong's latest developments and measures to drive sustained economic growth and consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international trade centre.

Mr Yau then visited an enterprise specialising in beauty and wellness products and exchanged views with its senior management on the vast potential of the Asian market. Mr Yau introduced Hong Kong's distinctive advantage of enjoying the strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and encouraged Australian enterprises to set up regional headquarters in Hong Kong to seize the opportunities of the Mainland, in particular the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Southeast Asian markets.

Mr Yau also had a lunch meeting with representatives of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the local business community to understand the needs and development directions of Australian enterprises and exchange views on fostering closer co-operation in the areas of business and trade between Hong Kong and Australia to achieve mutual benefits.

In the afternoon, Mr Yau met with a representative of the Australian Distillers Association to introduce Hong Kong's reduction in liquor duty to promote liquor trading and boost the development of high value-added industries including logistics and storage, tourism as well as high-end food and beverage consumption. He noted that the initiative has made reference to the successful experience in 2008 regarding the removal of import duty on wine, adding that he looks forward to seeing more premium liquor from Australia seizing the business opportunities. He also visited a distillery to understand more about the process of distilling and the development of Australian spirits.

  In the evening, Mr Yau attended the Hong Kong Australia Business Association NSW Chapter Business Awards Gala Dinner. Speaking at the event, he shared with the Australian business community the distinctive advantages of Hong Kong under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and the opportunities ahead for collaboration between Hong Kong and Australia. One of the examples is the recent enhancements to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement. Mr Yau said that provisions such as allowing Hong Kong-invested enterprises to adopt Hong Kong law and to choose for arbitration to be seated in Hong Kong empower foreign firms including Australian companies to leverage Hong Kong's legal and financial strengths when tapping into the Mainland market, especially within the GBA.

He added that Hong Kong ranked third globally in terms of foreign direct investment inflows, and with close to 10 000 overseas and Mainland companies as well as 4 700 start-ups present in Hong Kong, the city continues to thrive as a business hub.

Mr Yau said that regionally, Hong Kong is actively seeking to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), adding that Hong Kong will continue to communicate and collaborate with RCEP economies including Australia to advance this important goal.
ã
Mr Yau will return to Hong Kong tomorrow (August 16)."

FEHD strives to ensure food safety of school lunch boxes (with photos),2025-08-15 18:20,2025-08-15 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081400856.htm,"To enhance food safety and hygiene awareness among licensed food factories supplying school lunch boxes, and to prepare for the new school year, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) launched a series of operations to inspect licensed food factories supplying school lunch boxes in various districts of Hong Kong with a view to ensuring food safety.

A spokesman for the FEHD said today (August 15), ""Starting from July 28, the FEHD has been inspecting food factories supplying school lunch boxes to ensure that the licensing conditions in respect of food handling and processing are observed by the operators, and that hygienic standards stipulated in the laws are met. Food samples will be collected for testing. Meanwhile, FEHD staff will also provide health education to operators and staff of food factories, distributing food safety pamphlets to remind them of the proper way of handling school lunch boxes.""

The CFS hosted an online trade meeting on June 26 to remind lunch box suppliers to adhere to good hygiene practices when preparing food and establish a food safety plan based on the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system to lower the risks of food contamination. Lunch box caterers can make use of the guideline ""Developing a School Food Safety Plan Based on HACCP system (for School Lunch Box Caterers)"" to learn more about how to enhance the safety of lunch box production.

Furthermore, to ensure food safety on campuses, the CFS arranged an online seminar for schools on July 11, highlighting food safety hazards such as choking and food allergies, and emphasising the need for vigilance among teaching staff and food handlers in schools. At the same time, schools are also reminded to order lunch boxes from suppliers that hold a valid Food Factory Licence issued by the FEHD and are endorsed to provide lunch boxes. Before signing contracts with suppliers, schools should visit the premises to ensure that food handlers observe food safety and hygiene practices.

The CFS has published ""A Practical Guide for Ensuring Food Safety in Schools and Childcare Facilities"", to which schools and childcare facilities can refer when choosing lunchbox suppliers and ensuring food safety on campus.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-15 17:30,2025-08-15 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500659.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 15), one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures, especially upon returning to Hong Kong from regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Individuals experiencing symptoms such as fever or acute joint pain should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors of their travel history. Do not attempt self-testing, as this may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Latest case information

The new case involves a 23-year-old male who lives in Sai Kung District. An initial investigation revealed that he travelled to Shunde District, Foshan, in Guangdong Province, on August 1. During his stay, he was bitten by mosquitoes. He returned to Hong Kong on August 3 and developed a fever, joint pain and a rash on August 8. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Tsueng Kwan O Hospital yesterday (August 14) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

Since the patient stayed in Foshan during the incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as an imported case. The patient has no travel collateral and household contacts. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of nine confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the two patients, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspectionof the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âSeparately, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminded members of the public that currently, there are no rapid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for public use in self-testing for CF. People should promptly seek medical advice if they suspect they are infected with CF and should not conduct testing on their own as this may delay proper clinical treatment. He also urged the public not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example, increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication.

He also added that members of the public should adopt precautions during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 andpicaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âIn addition, the FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-15 17:30,2025-08-15 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500656.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月十五日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。中心提醒市民應採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後。若出現發燒或急性關節痛等病徵，應立即就醫並通知醫生相關旅遊史，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。

最新個案資料

新增個案涉及一名居於西貢區的23歲男子。初步調查顯示，他於八月一日起到廣東省佛山市順德區，期間曾被蚊叮咬。他在八月三日回港，八月八日起出現發燒、關節痛及皮疹。他昨日（八月十四日）到將軍澳醫院急症室求診，獲安排入院，在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於病人潛伏期身處佛山市，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人沒有其他同行人士或家居接觸者。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得九宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，目前，市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證的快速測試產品，供市民自行測試基孔肯雅熱。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。市民亦不應自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

他補充，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Taxi Service Commendation Scheme encourages trade to strive for excellence and give full play to new opportunities for quality service (with photos),2025-08-15 17:10,2025-08-15 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500331.htm,"  The Committee on Taxi Service Quality (CTSQ) and the Transport Department (TD) today (August 15) jointly held the Taxi Service Commendation Scheme Prize Presentation Ceremony 2024 to compliment quality taxi drivers and taxi service management teams.

  Officiating at the Prize Presentation Ceremony, the Acting Commissioner for Transport, Ms Candy Kwok, said she was glad to note the rising participation of taxi drivers, the trade and members of the public in the Commendation Scheme, which has been held for 22 years since 2002. This showed the public's support for and recognition of drivers and management teams providing quality services.

  Ms Kwok added that the Government had introduced a series of initiatives to enhance the overall quality of taxi services and promote the healthy development of the taxi industry in the long run. The TD issued official Taxi Fleet Licences to five taxi fleets in July 2025 with a view to offering quality services to the public. All fleet taxis provide multiple electronic payment means, while safety devices and the driver monitoring system have been installed to provide convenience for passengers and ensure driving safety.

  The Government has also submitted to the Legislative Council the legislative amendments on mandatory installation of Journey Recording Systems and provision of electronic payment means on taxis, strengthening the deterrent effect against malpractice by the black sheep in the taxi industry and safeguarding the interests of both drivers and passengers on one hand, while providing convenience for passengers to pay the fare on the other. Ms Kwok encouraged the trade to continue to strive for excellence to provide more quality ride experiences, thereby giving full play to new opportunities for quality service.

  Among 573 nominated taxi drivers, 20 were selected as Quality Taxi Drivers this year by an assessment panel comprising non-trade members of the CTSQ and relevant department representatives. The Most Popular Taxi Driver was presented to the driver with the highest number of votes in the public voting, while Good Driver, Good Service awards were presented to two drivers providing exceptional services during the ride. In addition, the assessment panel selected one Quality Taxi Service Management Team based on management, application of technology and social responsibility of management teams. The list of awardees is set out in the Annex."

署理運輸署署長郭惠英在頒獎典禮上表示，嘉許計劃自二○○二年起舉辦至今22年，樂見越來越多的士司機、業界及市民參與，反映市民對提供優良服務的司機和管理團隊的支持和肯定。

郭惠英表示，政府已推出一系列提升的士服務質素和促進行業長遠健康發展的措施。運輸署已於今年七月向五支車隊發出正式的士車隊牌照，讓市民使用優質服務。所有車隊的士均提供多項電子支付方式，並配置安全設備和司機監察系統等，以便利乘客及確保駕駛安全。

政府亦已向立法會提交有關強制的士安裝行車記錄系統及提供電子支付方式的立法修訂，一方面加強對業內害群之馬的阻嚇力，同時保障司機和乘客的權益，另一方面便利乘客支付車費。郭惠英鼓勵業界繼續精益求精，提供更優質的乘坐體驗，發揮優質服務新優勢。

Simon（香港咖啡紅茶協會主席黃家和）、各位好朋友、各位嘉賓、各位傳媒朋友：

今日來到全國及大灣區金茶王大賽2025（港式奶茶）——香港區決賽，來到這裏是特別親切的。好像Simon剛才所說，其實我二○一○年開始已經第一次參加金茶王大賽，坐在這裏當評判，當時和劉總（香港旅遊發展局總幹事劉鎮漢）一起當評判，連續參加了六年，然後就離開了。但是每年美食博覽的時候，都會上來看一看和哥（香港咖啡紅茶協會主席黃家和）外面的booth（攤檔），看看金茶王的進展。

其實港式奶茶真是很配合，除了旅遊，我們說香港「無處不旅遊」，我們美食處處，都在眼前、在附近，待大家發掘外，港式奶茶正正就是中外文化匯聚的佼佼者，其用的茶葉應該主要是西茶茶葉，淡奶也是比較西方的，但是到外國、到西方國家，怎樣喝tea with milk，都喝不到港式奶茶的味道；甚至到內地有很多港式餐廳，其實都是回來香港，那杯茶好像才最有味道，最適合心水。

這也是香港獨特之處，就是取了東方、我們中國的飲茶文化，西方tea with milk文化，放在一起成為了我們很獨特的港式奶茶。我由二○一○年到二○一五年（出席此活動），港式奶茶則是二○一七年成為非物質文化遺產，收錄在名冊之中。現在大家對港式奶茶一定都很有研究，譬如剛剛進來的時候，我在金茶王攤檔喝的時候，我也跟師傅說我要少奶、不要糖，但可能有些在座朋友就認為多奶滑一點，但我喜歡濃一點的，尤其是下午這些時候。這展示了（港式奶茶）可以很多元的，各適其適，我們選擇自己最喜歡的。即使到茶餐廳也是，可以多糖、少奶、多奶，甚至茶走，各樣，都可以有自己性格的。

來到今日，回來金茶王，見到這隻杯子，好像剛才Simon所說，有一年他的孫子在爬的時候，怕他爬了進去或拉了一隻杯子下來會砸到，這些記憶都回來了。我也很希望大家現在，完全在疫情回復過來，香港旅遊業重振雄風的時候，這些美好的記憶全部都回來。我們可以一起，今日見到這麼多業界的好朋友一起，我們同心攜手，將旅遊業、餐飲業、零售業做得比以前更好、更光、更亮、更熱。奶茶最緊要甚麼？是水滾茶靚吧，當然要熱，是不是？好，那我就不阻大家了。今日的比賽和活動，還有很精彩的在後頭，所以我也將時間交給我們美麗的司儀。多謝。"

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-08-15 16:42,2025-08-15 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500635.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (August 15) released the latest grading of water quality for 39 gazetted beaches (see Note 1) and one non-gazetted beach (see Note 2).

  Nineteen beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), 16 as Fair (Grade 2) and five as Poor (Grade 3).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach*
Silverstrand Beach*


Chung Hom Kok Beach
South Bay Beach*


Clear Water Bay Second Beach*
St. Stephen's Beach


Hap Mun Bay Beach*
Stanley Main Beach*


Hung Shing Yeh Beach*
Tai Po Lung Mei Beach*


Kiu Tsui Beach
Tong Fuk Beach


Kwun Yam Beach

Castle Peak Beach





  Compared with the grading released last week, Big Wave Bay Beach has been changed from Grade 2 to Grade 3.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

Note 1: Lifesaving services are provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department at 21 gazetted beaches, marked with an asterisk (*) above, from June 1. For details, please refer to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's Special Announcement (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/beach/index.html).

Note 2: This refers to Discovery Bay Tai Pak Beach, which has no lifesaving service."
"Special traffic and transport arrangements for football matches at Hong Kong Stadium on August 19, 20 and 23",2025-08-15 16:37,2025-08-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500595.htm,"ããThe Transport Department (TD) today (August 15) said that, to facilitate the holding of football matches at the Hong Kong Stadium on the evenings of August 19, 20 and 23, special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented in the vicinity of So Kon Po and Causeway Bay as follows. Spectators from the Mainland are urged to plan their journeys early, use the MTR, special bus or cross-boundary coach services, and heed the service hours of public transport services and boundary control points.

Road closures

ããThe following road sections will be temporarily closed to vehicular traffic in phases during the event period, until the closed roads are reopened:




Time
Details


From about 5.30pm


The section of Caroline Hill Road between Leighton Road and Cotton Path;
The section of Hysan Avenue westbound carriageway between Yun Ping Road and Hoi Ping Road;
Stadium Path; and
The section of Lee Garden Road between Lan Fong Road and Hysan Avenue (except for Green Minibuses (GMB)).




From about 9.30pm


Caroline Hill Road;
The section of Eastern Hospital Road between Caroline Hill Road and Cotton Path;
The section of Tung Lo Wan Road northbound between Eastern Hospital Road and Causeway Road;
The section of Tung Lo Wan Road southbound between Eastern Hospital Road and Causeway Road (except for franchised bus and GMB);
The northbound carriageway of Link Road (downhill);
Hoi Ping Road, Sunning Road, Sun Wui Road, Lee Garden Road, Lan Fong Road, Foo Ming Street, Pak Sha Road, Yun Ping Road, Kai Chiu Road, Hysan Avenue, Shelter Street and Cotton Path; and
Leighton Road (when necessary).






ããThe TD anticipates that, during the event period, the traffic in the vicinity of So Kon Po and Causeway Bay will be very congested. Motorists are advised to avoid driving to the affected areas.

Public transport service arrangements

ããIn connection with the above road closure arrangements, the following bus and GMB routes operating in the affected areas will be subject to temporary diversion and associated stop relocation arrangements during the event period:




Time
Details


From about 5.30pm


Citybus (CTB) route Nos. 5B and 8H will operate in the form of a circular route;
Cross-harbour bus (XHT) route No. 936 (Shek Wai Kok bound) will terminate at Moreton Terrace instead of Cotton Path; and
CTB route No. 678 (Sheung Shui bound) will depart at Causeway Road instead of Eastern Hospital Road (except for August 23).




From about 10pm


GMB route Nos. 14M, 21A, 21M, 26, 28, 28S and 30 will be temporarily diverted and operate as circular routes, terminating at Keswick Street.






ããThe TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal:


The MTR will enhance the interval between trains of the Island Line and the East Rail Line (ERL) on respective days as and when necessary;
CTB will provide one special bus route No. 976S from Causeway Bay (Moreton Terrace) Bus Terminus to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange; and
Cross-boundary coach services at Hennessy Road, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay (outside Times Square) will be strengthened at the closing of the event subject to passenger demand to facilitate travellers' return to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port and the Shenzhen Bay Port.


Special appeal to cross-boundary travellers

ããSpectators who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day after the football matches should pay special attention that, if they use the Lo Wu Control Point, they should take the MTR Island Line at Causeway Bay Station to Admiralty Station, and interchange the ERL towards Lo Wu Station. The last connecting train towards Lo Wu Station will depart from Causeway Bay Station at 10.44pm and Admiralty Station at 11.01pm. Travellers should plan their journeys ahead and arrive at the station platform in advance.

  For travellers who opt for LMC/HG Port (operating 24 hours daily), apart from the above special bus service route No. 976S directly departing from Causeway Bay, they may also take the MTR ERL to Sheung Shui Station and then KMB route No. 276B or N73, and transfer to the LMC-HG cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) for their journey to the Mainland.

  A spokesman for the TD said that, as a large number of travellers may use the LMC/HG Port after the football matches, and that concerts will also be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park on the evenings of August 19 and 20, the Port is expected to be very busy. Travellers' patience is appreciated. To ensure the smooth operation of public transport services, dedicated public transport lanes will be arranged at the LMC/HG Port after midnight during the event period when necessary for the smooth operation of the Yellow Bus and cross-boundary coach services as well as effective dispersal of a large number of cross-boundary travellers. Other cross-boundary private cars and their passengers are expected to have a longer clearance time. The TD has steered operators to reserve standby vehicles and manpower to meet passengers' demand.

ããMembers of the public are advised to make use of public transport services as far as possible to avoid traffic congestion and unnecessary delays. During the event, the TD and the Police will closely monitor the traffic situation. The Police may adjust the traffic arrangements subject to the prevailing crowd and traffic conditions in the areas. Members of the public should pay attention to the latest traffic news through radio, television or the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application.

ããFor details of the special traffic and public transport arrangements, members of the public may visit the TD website (www.td.gov.hk), its mobile application ""HKeMobility"" or passenger notices issued by the relevant public transport operators."

""Composite Employment Estimates 2024""

  In studies of employment statistics, the issue of discrepancies observed between the employment data obtained from establishment-based surveys (which refer to occupied posts in firms) and those data obtained from household surveys (which refer to persons employed) is common. To tackle this, the C&SD has been compiling a set of Composite Employment Estimates (CEE) which reconciles, under a designated statistical framework, the results obtained from the household-based General Household Survey and the establishment-based Quarterly Survey of Employment and Vacancies since 1997.

  This feature article provides the CEE figures in individual industries for 2019 to 2024. It also gives an account of the characteristics of CEE and briefly discusses the differences and usage of CEE vis-à-vis the other employment figures.

  For enquiries about this feature article, please contact the Employment Statistics Section of the C&SD (Tel: 2582 4751; email: employment@censtatd.gov.hk).

  Published in bilingual form, the HKMDS is a compact volume of official statistics containing about 130 tables. It collects up-to-date statistical series on various aspects of the social and economic situation of Hong Kong. Topics include population; labour; external trade; National Income and Balance of Payments; prices; business performance; energy; housing and property; government accounts, finance and insurance; and transport, communications and tourism. For selected key statistical items, over 20 charts depicting the annual trend in the past decade and quarterly or monthly trend in the recent two years are also available.

Economic performance in second quarter of 2025 and latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025,2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500555.htm,"  The Government released today (August 15) the Half-yearly Economic Report 2025, together with the revised figures on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter of 2025.

  The Acting Government Economist, Dr Cecilia Lam, gave an account of the economic performance in the second quarter of 2025 and the latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025.

Main points

ï¼ The Hong Kong economy continued to expand solidly in the second quarter of 2025, supported by strong exports performance and improved domestic demand. Real GDP grew by 3.1% year-on-year in the second quarter, picking up slightly from the growth of 3.0% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, real GDP rose further by 0.4%.

ï¼ Notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainties to global economy and trade brought about by the United States' (US) trade policy, resilient external demand, together with some rush shipments in response to the US' temporary easing of tariff measures, supported Hong Kong's total exports of goods to see accelerated year-on-year growth of 11.5% in real terms in the second quarter. Meanwhile, thanks to strong growth in inbound tourism, sustained expansion in cross-boundary traffic, and vibrant financial and related business service activities amid the buoyant local stock market, exports of services continued to expand notably by 7.5% in real terms over a year earlier.

ï¼ Domestically, private consumption expenditure resumed moderate growth of 1.9% year-on-year in real terms in the second quarter after four consecutive quarters of decline. Meanwhile, overall investment expenditure increased further by 2.8% in real terms over a year earlier, thanks to a surge in expenditure on machinery, equipment and intellectual property products.

ï¼ The labour market saw some softening in the second quarter. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.5% from 3.2% in the preceding quarter. The underemployment rate also increased. Employment earnings grew solidly further over a year earlier.

ï¼ The local stock market maintained upward momentum in the second quarter as market sentiment improved after the situation of trade tensions eased somewhat. The residential property market showed some stabilisation during the quarter. Flat prices held broadly stable, and rentals stayed resilient.

ï¼ Consumer price inflation stayed modest in the second quarter. The underlying Composite Consumer Price Index (Composite CPI) increased by 1.1% over a year earlier, following the 1.2% increase in the preceding quarter. Price pressures on major components were largely contained. Including the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the headline Composite CPI increased by 1.8% over a year earlier, higher than the 1.6% increase in the preceding quarter.

ï¼ Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain growth for the rest of 2025. Steady economic growth in Asia, in particular the Mainland, together with the sustained increases in local employment earnings, the robust stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market will bode well for various sectors of the Hong Kong economy. The Government's various measures to boost consumption, attract investment and diversify markets will also provide further support to the Hong Kong economy. Yet, the tariff rates announced by the US in early August stay elevated, and its tariff policy on some commodities remains quite uncertain. The impact of these developments on international trade flows and also the US' inflation and economic activities may surface gradually later this year. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest rate cut in the US will also affect local investment sentiment. Hong Kong's economic growth momentum going forward will, to a certain extent, depend on how these factors evolve.

ï¼ Taking into account the actual outturn in the first half of the year and the latest developments of the global and local situation, the real GDP growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is maintained at 2%-3%, the same as that in the May round of review. The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation.

ï¼ On the inflation outlook, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term as pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check. Considering that the inflation situation in the first half of the year was broadly in line with earlier expectations, the forecasts for the underlying and headline consumer price inflation rates for 2025 are maintained at 1.5% and 1.8% respectively, the same as those in the May round of review.
 
Details

GDP

  According to the revised figures released today by the Census and Statistics Department, real GDP grew by 3.1% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025 (same as the advance estimate), having increased by 3.0% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, real GDP rose by 0.4% in the second quarter (same as the advance estimate), after a 1.8% increase in the preceding quarter (Chart).

  The latest figures on GDP and its major expenditure components up to the second quarter of 2025 are presented in Table 1. Developments in different segments of the economy in the second quarter are described below.

External trade

  Total exports of goods saw accelerated year-on-year growth of 11.5% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025, following an 8.4% increase in the preceding quarter. Resilient external demand, together with some rush shipments in response to the US' temporary easing of tariff measures, rendered support to export performance. Analysed by major market and by reference to external merchandise trade statistics, exports to the Mainland posted further double-digit growth. Exports to ASEAN markets accelerated further, and those to most high-income Asian economies saw increases of varying degrees. Exports to the US turned to a decline, and those to the European Union fell further. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, total exports of goods rose by 2.9% in real terms in the second quarter.

  Exports of services continued to expand notably by 7.5% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, after growing by 6.3% in the preceding quarter. Exports of all major service groups showed further increases. Specifically, exports of travel and transport services rose further thanks to strong growth in inbound tourism and sustained expansion in cross-boundary traffic. Exports of financial services and business and other services also continued to grow, supported by vibrant financial and related business service activities amid the buoyant local stock market. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, exports of services edged down by 0.5% in real terms in the second quarter.

Domestic sector

  Private consumption saw some stabilisation in the second quarter of 2025, showing a turnaround after a year of subdued performance amid the changes in residents' consumption patterns. The continued increase in employment earnings, the decline in local interest rates, the buoyant local stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market have provided support. Private consumption expenditure turned to an increase of 1.9% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, after declining by 1.2% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter to quarter basis, private consumption expenditure increased by 3.4% in real terms. Meanwhile, government consumption expenditure increased by 2.5% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, after rising by 0.9% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter to quarter basis, government consumption expenditure increased by 0.9% in real terms.

  Overall investment expenditure in terms of gross domestic fixed capital formation increased by 2.8% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, further to a 1.1% increase in the preceding quarter. Expenditure on acquisitions of machinery, equipment and intellectual property products leapt by 38.4%, with private sector spending showing particularly strong growth. Yet, expenditure on building and construction continued to contract by 9.5%. Costs of ownership transfer shrank by 8.7% from a high base last year.

The labour sector

  The labour market saw some softening in the second quarter of 2025. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.5% from 3.2% in the preceding quarter. The underemployment rate also increased to 1.4% from 1.1%. The median monthly employment earnings of full-time employees in nominal terms grew solidly further by 6.3% in the second quarter over a year earlier.

The asset markets

  The local stock market maintained upward momentum in the second quarter of 2025. Despite a sharp sell-off alongside other major markets following the US’ announcement of the so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" in early April, market sentiment improved subsequently as trade tensions eased after the US temporarily suspended many of these tariffs. The Hang Seng Index (HSI) recouped lost grounds and sustained the uptrend to close the second quarter at 24 072, up 4.1% from end-March. Since entering the third quarter, local stock market has stayed vibrant, with the HSI surpassing the level at the end of the second quarter in recent days.

  The residential property market showed some stabilisation in the second quarter. Market sentiment continued to improve amid easing external uncertainties, particularly after the sharp declines in the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in May which subsequently lowered mortgage rates. Overall flat prices held broadly stable, rising back by 1% during the second quarter. Largely driven by the notable declines in mortgage rates during the quarter, the index of home purchase affordability improved further to around 55%, which was comparable to the long-term average. The number of transactions, in terms of the total number of sale and purchase agreements for residential property received by the Land Registry, rebounded appreciably by 37% over the preceding quarter to 16 574 in the second quarter, only 7% lower than the high level a year ago. Overall flat rentals stayed resilient, with a further increase of 1% between March and June. The non-residential property market stayed weak in general in the second quarter. While prices and rentals remained soft, trading activities of all major market segments picked up.

Prices

  Consumer price inflation stayed modest in the second quarter of 2025. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.1% in the second quarter over a year earlier, following the 1.2% increase in the preceding quarter. Major components generally saw modest to moderate changes as compared with a year earlier, as domestic and external price pressures stayed broadly in check. Including the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the headline Composite CPI increased by 1.8% in the second quarter over a year earlier, higher than the 1.6% increase in the preceding quarter. The headline inflation rate was higher than its underlying counterpart in the second quarter, mainly due to the smaller electricity charges subsidy provided by the Government and lower ceiling of rates concession compared with the same period last year.

Latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025

  Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain growth for the rest of 2025. Steady economic growth in Asia, in particular the Mainland, together with the sustained increases in local employment earnings, the robust stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market will bode well for various sectors of the Hong Kong economy. The Government’s various measures to boost consumption, attract investment and diversify markets will also provide further support to the Hong Kong economy. Yet, the tariff rates announced by the US in early August stay elevated, and its tariff policy on some commodities remains quite uncertain. The impact of these developments on international trade flows and also the US' inflation and economic activities may surface gradually later this year. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest rate cut in the US will also affect local investment sentiment. Hong Kong's economic growth momentum going forward will, to a certain extent, depend on how these factors evolve.

  Taking into account the actual outturn in the first half of the year and the latest developments of the global and local situation, the real GDP growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is maintained at 2%-3%, the same as that in the May round of review (Table 2). The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation. For reference, the latest growth forecasts by private sector analysts range between 1.8% and 3.0%, averaging around 2.4%.

  On the inflation outlook, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term as pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check. Considering that the inflation situation in the first half of the year was broadly in line with earlier expectations, the forecasts for the underlying and headline consumer price inflation rates for 2025 are maintained at 1.5% and 1.8% respectively, the same as those in the May round of review (Table 2).

研究就業統計數據時，經常會遇到一種情況，就是從機構單位統計調查獲取的就業數據（即已填補的公司職位數目）與從住戶統計調查所獲得的就業數據（即就業人士數目）存有差異。有見及此，政府統計處自一九九七年開始，運用特定的統計方法，協調分別以住戶及機構單位作為基礎的「綜合住戶統計調查」及「僱傭及職位空缺按季統計調查」的結果，從而編製一套「就業綜合估計數字」，以處理上述的情況。

該篇專題文章提供二零一九年至二零二四年期間各行業的「就業綜合估計數字」，並介紹該套數字的特徵，以及闡釋它與其他就業統計數字的分別和用途。

有關該篇專題文章的查詢，請與政府統計處就業統計組聯絡（電話：2582 4751；電郵：employment@censtatd.gov.hk）。

Update on dengue fever,2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500576.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 15) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases. The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui,reminded the public that due to the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, mosquito infestation might be aggravated in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public will travel to DF-endemic regions more frequently during the summer holiday. Therefore, the risk of DF in Hong Kong is increasing.

  From August 8 to yesterday (August 14), the CHP recorded two imported DF cases. The patients had travelled to Cambodia and India during the incubation periods respectively.

As of yesterday, 41 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 586 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 121 cases were recorded in the week between August 4 and 10, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Foshan, Chaozhou and Shenzhen.

Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

  ""There have been frequent imported cases of DF in Hong Kong, as well as occasional sporadic local cases every year. The presence of Aedes albopictus in Hong Kong makes our population vulnerable. Mosquitoes breed quickly during the hot and rainy summer months. There are risks of DF outbreaks if mosquito control is inadequate. Hence, mosquito control is of paramount importance. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. The public is reminded that eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are key to preventing DF. Those returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor,"" Dr Tsui added.

  Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.


âDEET-containing insect repellents are effective and the public should take heed of the tips below:


Read the label instructions carefully first;
Apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
Apply on exposed skin and clothing;
Use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
Apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
In addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."
登革熱最新情況,2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500574.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月十五日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，由於在夏季期間氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況可能會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往登革熱流行地區，因此本地登革熱的風險正在上升。

由八月八日至昨日（八月十四日），中心錄得兩宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾分別到柬埔寨及印度。

截至昨日，今年錄得41宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過二萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得586宗本地感染病例，於八月四日至十日的一周內錄得121宗，其中以廣州、佛山、潮州和深圳的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

徐樂堅醫生說：「本港經常有外地傳入的登革熱個案，每年間中亦有零星的本地登革熱個案。由於香港存在白紋伊蚊，本地市民有機會受感染。炎熱多雨的季節有利蚊子迅速繁殖。如控蚊成效不足，更有爆發登革熱的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防登革熱的最佳方法。市民如從受登革熱影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

市民應繼續採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


​含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務登革熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁及YouTube頻道。"
二零二五年第二季經濟表現及二零二五年本地生產總值和物價最新預測,2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500565.htm,"政府今日（八月十五日）發表《二零二五年半年經濟報告》和二零二五年第二季度的本地生產總值修訂數字。

署理政府經濟顧問林幗瑛博士闡述二零二五年第二季的經濟表現，以及最新的二零二五年全年本地生產總值和物價預測。

要點

＊在出口表現強勁及本地需求改善的支持下，香港經濟在二零二五年第二季繼續穩健擴張。實質本地生產總值在第二季按年增長3.1%，輕微高於上一季3.0%的增幅。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值進一步上升0.4%。

＊儘管美國貿易政策持續對全球經濟及貿易帶來不確定性，外部需求強韌，加上因美國暫緩關稅措施而令部分貨物搶先付運，支持香港整體貨物出口在第二季按年實質增長加快至11.5%。同時，受惠於訪港旅遊業強勁增長、跨境運輸量持續擴張，以及金融及相關商業服務活動在本地股市暢旺下表現活躍，服務輸出繼續按年實質顯著擴張7.5%。

＊本地方面，私人消費開支經過連續四季下跌後，在第二季恢復溫和增長，按年實質上升1.9%。同時，受惠於購置機器、設備及知識產權產品的開支急升，整體投資開支按年進一步實質上升2.8%。

＊勞工市場在第二季稍為放緩。經季節性調整的失業率由上一季的3.2%上升至3.5%。就業不足率亦上升。就業收入按年進一步穩健增長。

＊由於市場氣氛在貿易緊張局勢有所緩解後好轉，本地股票市場在第二季維持升勢。季內住宅物業市場略見回穩。住宅售價大致企穩，租金保持強韌。

＊第二季消費物價通脹維持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數按年上升1.1%，上一季的升幅為1.2%。主要組成項目的價格壓力大致受控。計及政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應，整體綜合消費物價指數按年上升1.8%，高於上一季的1.6%。

＊展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間可望保持增長。亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，加上本地就業收入持續增加、股票市場暢旺，以及住宅物業市場回穩，將會利好香港經濟的各個環節。政府多項提振消費、吸引投資，以及開拓市場的措施，亦會為本港經濟提供進一步支持。然而，美國在八月初公布的關稅水平仍然偏高，對部分商品的關稅政策仍相當不明朗。這些發展對國際貿易流向，以至美國當地通脹和經濟活動的影響或會在今年稍後時間陸續浮現。此外，美國減息步伐的不確定性亦會影響本地投資氣氛。香港經濟往後的增長動力將在一定程度上取決於這些因素如何演變。

＊考慮到今年上半年的實際數字以及全球和本地情況的最新發展，二零二五年全年實質本地生產總值增長預測維持在2%至3%，和五月覆檢時相同。政府將繼續密切監察相關情況。

＊通脹展望方面，由於本地成本和外圍價格壓力應會大致可控，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。考慮到今年上半年的通脹情況與較早時預計相若，二零二五年基本和整體消費物價通脹率的預測分別維持在1.5%及1.8%，與五月覆檢時相同。 

詳細分析

本地生產總值

根據政府統計處今天發布的修訂數字，二零二五年第二季實質本地生產總值按年增長3.1%（與預先估計相同），上一季上升3.0%。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值在第二季上升0.4%（與預先估計相同），上一季上升1.8%（圖）。

附表一載列了截至二零二五年第二季的本地生產總值及其主要開支組成部分的最新數字。各經濟環節在第二季的發展情況詳述如下。

對外貿易

整體貨物出口繼上一季按年實質上升8.4%後，在二零二五年第二季的增長加快至11.5%。外部需求強韌，加上因美國暫緩關稅措施而令部分貨物搶先付運，均為出口表現提供支持。參考對外商品貿易統計數字並按主要市場分析，輸往內地的出口繼續錄得雙位數增長。輸往東盟市場的出口進一步加快，輸往大部分亞洲高收入經濟體的出口錄得不同程度升幅。輸往美國的出口轉為下跌，輸往歐盟的出口進一步下跌。經季節性調整後按季比較，整體貨物出口在第二季實質上升2.9%。

服務輸出繼上一季按年實質增長6.3%後，在第二季繼續顯著擴張7.5%。所有主要服務組別的輸出均進一步增加。具體而言，受惠於訪港旅遊業強勁增長和跨境運輸量持續擴張，旅遊服務輸出和運輸服務輸出進一步上升。受惠於金融及相關商業服務活動在本地股市暢旺下表現活躍，金融服務輸出和商用及其他服務輸出亦繼續增長。經季節性調整後按季比較，服務輸出在第二季實質微跌0.5%。

內部經濟

私人消費在二零二五年第二季略見回穩，扭轉在此之前的一年間在市民消費模式改變下的疲弱表現。就業收入持續增加、本地息口下降、本地股票市場暢旺，以及住宅物業市場回穩提供了支持。私人消費開支在第二季轉為按年實質上升1.9%，上一季下跌1.2%。經季節性調整後按季比較，私人消費開支實質上升3.4%。同時，政府消費開支繼上一季按年實質上升0.9%後，在第二季上升2.5%。經季節性調整後按季比較，政府消費開支實質上升0.9%。

按本地固定資本形成總額計算的整體投資開支繼上一季按年實質上升1.1%後，在第二季上升2.8%。購置機器、設備及知識產權產品的開支躍升38.4%，當中私營機構開支增幅尤為強勁。然而，樓宇及建造開支繼續減少9.5%。擁有權轉讓費用較去年的高基數縮減8.7%。

勞工市場

勞工市場在二零二五年第二季稍為放緩。經季節性調整的失業率由上一季的3.2%上升至3.5%。就業不足率亦由1.1%上升至1.4%。全職僱員每月就業收入中位數以名義計算在第二季按年進一步穩健增長6.3%。

資產市場

本地股票市場在二零二五年第二季維持升勢。儘管四月初美國宣布徵收所謂的「對等關稅」後，港股跟隨其他主要市場出現大幅拋售，但其後美國暫緩實施大部分關稅措施，貿易緊張局勢緩和，市場氣氛因而好轉。恒生指數（恒指）收復失地並持續上升，於第二季末收報24 072點，較三月底高4.1%。踏入第三季以來，本地股市保持暢旺，近日恒指已超越第二季末的水平。

住宅物業市場在第二季略見回穩。隨着外圍環境的不確定性有所緩解，尤其是在港元銀行同業拆息於五月急跌帶動按揭利率向下後，市場氣氛持續改善。整體住宅售價大致企穩，在第二季內回升1%。主要受按揭利率在季內顯著下跌所帶動，置業負擔指數進一步改善至約55%，與長期平均數相若。交投量方面，第二季送交土地註冊處註冊的住宅物業買賣合約總數較上一季顯著反彈37%至16 574 份，較一年前的高水平僅低 7%。整體住宅租金保持強韌，在三月至六月期間進一步上升1%。非住宅物業市場在第二季大致維持疲弱。售價和租金仍然偏軟，所有主要市場環節的交投活動則有所增加。

物價

二零二五年第二季消費物價通脹維持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數在第二季按年上升1.1%，上一季的升幅為1.2%。主要組成項目與一年前相比普遍呈現輕微至溫和變動，反映本地和外圍價格壓力大致受控。計及政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應，整體綜合消費物價指數在第二季按年上升1.8%，高於上一季的1.6%。第二季整體通脹率高於基本通脹率，主要是由於政府提供的電費補貼較去年同期少，差餉寬減上限亦較去年同期低。

二零二五年本地生產總值和物價的最新預測

展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間可望保持增長。亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，加上本地就業收入持續增加、股票市場暢旺，以及住宅物業市場回穩，將會利好香港經濟的各個環節。政府多項提振消費、吸引投資，以及開拓市場的措施，亦會為本港經濟提供進一步支持。然而，美國在八月初公布的關稅水平仍然偏高，對部分商品的關稅政策仍相當不明朗。這些發展對國際貿易流向，以至美國當地通脹和經濟活動的影響或會在今年稍後時間陸續浮現。此外，美國減息步伐的不確定性亦會影響本地投資氣氛。香港經濟往後的增長動力將在一定程度上取決於這些因素如何演變。

考慮到二零二五年上半年的實際數字以及全球和本地情況的最新發展，二零二五年全年實質本地生產總值增長預測維持在2%至3%，和五月覆檢時相同（附表二）。政府將繼續密切監察相關情況。作為參考，現時私營機構分析員的增長預測介乎1.8%至3.0%之間，平均約為2.4%。

通脹展望方面，由於本地成本和外圍價格壓力應仍大致可控，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。考慮到今年上半年的通脹情況與較早時預計相若，二零二五年基本和整體消費物價通脹率的預測分別維持在1.5%及1.8%，與五月覆檢時相同（附表二）。

住宅物業市場在第二季略見回穩。隨着外圍環境的不確定性有所緩解，尤其是在港元銀行同業拆息於五月急跌帶動按揭利率向下後，市場氣氛持續改善。整體住宅售價大致企穩，在第二季內回升1%。主要受按揭利率在季內顯著下跌所帶動，置業負擔指數進一步改善至約55%，與長期平均數相若。交投量方面，第二季送交土地註冊處註冊的住宅物業買賣合約總數較上一季顯著反彈37%至16 574 份，較一年前的高水平僅低 7%。整體住宅租金保持強韌，在三月至六月期間進一步上升1%。非住宅物業市場在第二季大致維持疲弱。售價和租金仍然偏軟，所有主要市場環節的交投活動則有所增加。

物價

二零二五年第二季消費物價通脹維持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數在第二季按年上升1.1%，上一季的升幅為1.2%。主要組成項目與一年前相比普遍呈現輕微至溫和變動，反映本地和外圍價格壓力大致受控。計及政府的一次性紓緩措施的效應，整體綜合消費物價指數在第二季按年上升1.8%，高於上一季的1.6%。第二季整體通脹率高於基本通脹率，主要是由於政府提供的電費補貼較去年同期少，差餉寬減上限亦較去年同期低。

二零二五年本地生產總值和物價的最新預測

展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間可望保持增長。亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，加上本地就業收入持續增加、股票市場暢旺，以及住宅物業市場回穩，將會利好香港經濟的各個環節。政府多項提振消費、吸引投資，以及開拓市場的措施，亦會為本港經濟提供進一步支持。然而，美國在八月初公布的關稅水平仍然偏高，對部分商品的關稅政策仍相當不明朗。這些發展對國際貿易流向，以至美國當地通脹和經濟活動的影響或會在今年稍後時間陸續浮現。此外，美國減息步伐的不確定性亦會影響本地投資氣氛。香港經濟往後的增長動力將在一定程度上取決於這些因素如何演變。

考慮到二零二五年上半年的實際數字以及全球和本地情況的最新發展，二零二五年全年實質本地生產總值增長預測維持在2%至3%，和五月覆檢時相同（附表二）。政府將繼續密切監察相關情況。作為參考，現時私營機構分析員的增長預測介乎1.8%至3.0%之間，平均約為2.4%。

通脹展望方面，由於本地成本和外圍價格壓力應仍大致可控，整體通脹短期內應維持輕微。考慮到今年上半年的通脹情況與較早時預計相若，二零二五年基本和整體消費物價通脹率的預測分別維持在1.5%及1.8%，與五月覆檢時相同（附表二）。

Economic performance in second quarter of 2025 and latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025 (with photo/video),2025-08-15 16:30,2025-08-15 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/15/P2025081500555.htm,"  The Government released today (August 15) the Half-yearly Economic Report 2025, together with the revised figures on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter of 2025.

  The Acting Government Economist, Dr Cecilia Lam, gave an account of the economic performance in the second quarter of 2025 and the latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025.

Main points

ï¼ The Hong Kong economy continued to expand solidly in the second quarter of 2025, supported by strong exports performance and improved domestic demand. Real GDP grew by 3.1% year-on-year in the second quarter, picking up slightly from the growth of 3.0% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, real GDP rose further by 0.4%.

ï¼ Notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainties to global economy and trade brought about by the United States' (US) trade policy, resilient external demand, together with some rush shipments in response to the US' temporary easing of tariff measures, supported Hong Kong's total exports of goods to see accelerated year-on-year growth of 11.5% in real terms in the second quarter. Meanwhile, thanks to strong growth in inbound tourism, sustained expansion in cross-boundary traffic, and vibrant financial and related business service activities amid the buoyant local stock market, exports of services continued to expand notably by 7.5% in real terms over a year earlier.

ï¼ Domestically, private consumption expenditure resumed moderate growth of 1.9% year-on-year in real terms in the second quarter after four consecutive quarters of decline. Meanwhile, overall investment expenditure increased further by 2.8% in real terms over a year earlier, thanks to a surge in expenditure on machinery, equipment and intellectual property products.

ï¼ The labour market saw some softening in the second quarter. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.5% from 3.2% in the preceding quarter. The underemployment rate also increased. Employment earnings grew solidly further over a year earlier.

ï¼ The local stock market maintained upward momentum in the second quarter as market sentiment improved after the situation of trade tensions eased somewhat. The residential property market showed some stabilisation during the quarter. Flat prices held broadly stable, and rentals stayed resilient.

ï¼ Consumer price inflation stayed modest in the second quarter. The underlying Composite Consumer Price Index (Composite CPI) increased by 1.1% over a year earlier, following the 1.2% increase in the preceding quarter. Price pressures on major components were largely contained. Including the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the headline Composite CPI increased by 1.8% over a year earlier, higher than the 1.6% increase in the preceding quarter.

ï¼ Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain growth for the rest of 2025. Steady economic growth in Asia, in particular the Mainland, together with the sustained increases in local employment earnings, the robust stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market will bode well for various sectors of the Hong Kong economy. The Government's various measures to boost consumption, attract investment and diversify markets will also provide further support to the Hong Kong economy. Yet, the tariff rates announced by the US in early August stay elevated, and its tariff policy on some commodities remains quite uncertain. The impact of these developments on international trade flows and also the US' inflation and economic activities may surface gradually later this year. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest rate cut in the US will also affect local investment sentiment. Hong Kong's economic growth momentum going forward will, to a certain extent, depend on how these factors evolve.

ï¼ Taking into account the actual outturn in the first half of the year and the latest developments of the global and local situation, the real GDP growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is maintained at 2%-3%, the same as that in the May round of review. The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation.

ï¼ On the inflation outlook, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term as pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check. Considering that the inflation situation in the first half of the year was broadly in line with earlier expectations, the forecasts for the underlying and headline consumer price inflation rates for 2025 are maintained at 1.5% and 1.8% respectively, the same as those in the May round of review.
 
Details

GDP

  According to the revised figures released today by the Census and Statistics Department, real GDP grew by 3.1% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025 (same as the advance estimate), having increased by 3.0% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, real GDP rose by 0.4% in the second quarter (same as the advance estimate), after a 1.8% increase in the preceding quarter (Chart).

  The latest figures on GDP and its major expenditure components up to the second quarter of 2025 are presented in Table 1. Developments in different segments of the economy in the second quarter are described below.

External trade

  Total exports of goods saw accelerated year-on-year growth of 11.5% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025, following an 8.4% increase in the preceding quarter. Resilient external demand, together with some rush shipments in response to the US' temporary easing of tariff measures, rendered support to export performance. Analysed by major market and by reference to external merchandise trade statistics, exports to the Mainland posted further double-digit growth. Exports to ASEAN markets accelerated further, and those to most high-income Asian economies saw increases of varying degrees. Exports to the US turned to a decline, and those to the European Union fell further. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, total exports of goods rose by 2.9% in real terms in the second quarter.

  Exports of services continued to expand notably by 7.5% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, after growing by 6.3% in the preceding quarter. Exports of all major service groups showed further increases. Specifically, exports of travel and transport services rose further thanks to strong growth in inbound tourism and sustained expansion in cross-boundary traffic. Exports of financial services and business and other services also continued to grow, supported by vibrant financial and related business service activities amid the buoyant local stock market. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, exports of services edged down by 0.5% in real terms in the second quarter.

Domestic sector

  Private consumption saw some stabilisation in the second quarter of 2025, showing a turnaround after a year of subdued performance amid the changes in residents' consumption patterns. The continued increase in employment earnings, the decline in local interest rates, the buoyant local stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market have provided support. Private consumption expenditure turned to an increase of 1.9% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, after declining by 1.2% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter to quarter basis, private consumption expenditure increased by 3.4% in real terms. Meanwhile, government consumption expenditure increased by 2.5% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, after rising by 0.9% in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter to quarter basis, government consumption expenditure increased by 0.9% in real terms.

  Overall investment expenditure in terms of gross domestic fixed capital formation increased by 2.8% in real terms in the second quarter over a year earlier, further to a 1.1% increase in the preceding quarter. Expenditure on acquisitions of machinery, equipment and intellectual property products leapt by 38.4%, with private sector spending showing particularly strong growth. Yet, expenditure on building and construction continued to contract by 9.5%. Costs of ownership transfer shrank by 8.7% from a high base last year.

The labour sector

  The labour market saw some softening in the second quarter of 2025. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.5% from 3.2% in the preceding quarter. The underemployment rate also increased to 1.4% from 1.1%. The median monthly employment earnings of full-time employees in nominal terms grew solidly further by 6.3% in the second quarter over a year earlier.

The asset markets

  The local stock market maintained upward momentum in the second quarter of 2025. Despite a sharp sell-off alongside other major markets following the US’ announcement of the so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" in early April, market sentiment improved subsequently as trade tensions eased after the US temporarily suspended many of these tariffs. The Hang Seng Index (HSI) recouped lost grounds and sustained the uptrend to close the second quarter at 24 072, up 4.1% from end-March. Since entering the third quarter, local stock market has stayed vibrant, with the HSI surpassing the level at the end of the second quarter in recent days.

  The residential property market showed some stabilisation in the second quarter. Market sentiment continued to improve amid easing external uncertainties, particularly after the sharp declines in the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates in May which subsequently lowered mortgage rates. Overall flat prices held broadly stable, rising back by 1% during the second quarter. Largely driven by the notable declines in mortgage rates during the quarter, the index of home purchase affordability improved further to around 55%, which was comparable to the long-term average. The number of transactions, in terms of the total number of sale and purchase agreements for residential property received by the Land Registry, rebounded appreciably by 37% over the preceding quarter to 16 574 in the second quarter, only 7% lower than the high level a year ago. Overall flat rentals stayed resilient, with a further increase of 1% between March and June. The non-residential property market stayed weak in general in the second quarter. While prices and rentals remained soft, trading activities of all major market segments picked up.

Prices

  Consumer price inflation stayed modest in the second quarter of 2025. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.1% in the second quarter over a year earlier, following the 1.2% increase in the preceding quarter. Major components generally saw modest to moderate changes as compared with a year earlier, as domestic and external price pressures stayed broadly in check. Including the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the headline Composite CPI increased by 1.8% in the second quarter over a year earlier, higher than the 1.6% increase in the preceding quarter. The headline inflation rate was higher than its underlying counterpart in the second quarter, mainly due to the smaller electricity charges subsidy provided by the Government and lower ceiling of rates concession compared with the same period last year.

Latest GDP and price forecasts for 2025

  Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain growth for the rest of 2025. Steady economic growth in Asia, in particular the Mainland, together with the sustained increases in local employment earnings, the robust stock market, and the stabilisation of residential property market will bode well for various sectors of the Hong Kong economy. The Government’s various measures to boost consumption, attract investment and diversify markets will also provide further support to the Hong Kong economy. Yet, the tariff rates announced by the US in early August stay elevated, and its tariff policy on some commodities remains quite uncertain. The impact of these developments on international trade flows and also the US' inflation and economic activities may surface gradually later this year. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest rate cut in the US will also affect local investment sentiment. Hong Kong's economic growth momentum going forward will, to a certain extent, depend on how these factors evolve.

  Taking into account the actual outturn in the first half of the year and the latest developments of the global and local situation, the real GDP growth forecast for 2025 as a whole is maintained at 2%-3%, the same as that in the May round of review (Table 2). The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation. For reference, the latest growth forecasts by private sector analysts range between 1.8% and 3.0%, averaging around 2.4%.

  On the inflation outlook, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term as pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check. Considering that the inflation situation in the first half of the year was broadly in line with earlier expectations, the forecasts for the underlying and headline consumer price inflation rates for 2025 are maintained at 1.5% and 1.8% respectively, the same as those in the May round of review (Table 2).

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 14 to noon today (August 15), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 105 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

 The 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections will be held on September 7 (Sunday). The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission, Mr Justice David Lok, inspected the hands-on training session organised by the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) today (August 15) to see for himself the training provided to the electoral staff of the central counting station.

 The staff participating in the training today will mainly perform counting duties at the central counting station on the polling day. This training session aims to enhance their understanding of the operation of the relevant system and workflow, and the way to quickly input the votes obtained by each candidate to the relevant system if the fallback counting contingency plan is activated, to ensure that the votes are counted in an accurate and efficient manner.

 Mr Justice Lok said that this training session and simulation could enable the staff to get familiar with the relevant details and arrangements, and the measures to be taken in case of contingencies. He also thanked the electoral staff for their joint efforts and dedication in ensuring that the count would be conducted openly, fairly and honestly.

Five ordinary polling stations will be set up for the ECSS By-elections. After the close of the poll, all ballot boxes will be delivered to the central counting station located at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre for counting. The entire counting process involves different steps and details. The REO will continue to arrange different training sessions and simulation exercises for staff responsible for various tasks, including those responsible for operating the electronic counting machines, with an aim of deepening their understanding of their work while at the same time strengthening the co-ordination and response capabilities among staff with different responsibilities for making a detailed and comprehensive preparation for the By-elections and ensuring that the counting of votes can be carried out smoothly."

為配合上述封路安排，以下行經受影響地區的巴士及專線小巴路線將於賽事日子，實施改道及相應臨時遷移站點安排：




時間
詳情


下午約五時三十分起


城巴第5B及8H號線會於活動開始期間改為循環線；
隧巴第936號線（往石圍角）的總站會由棉花路改為摩頓臺；及

晚上約十時起
專線小巴第14M、21A、21M、26、28、28S及30號線將臨時改道及以循環線形式運作，並改以敬誠街為終點站。




運輸署已協調本地及跨境公共運輸服務營辦商在離場時段加強服務：


港鐵將按需要於相關日子加密港島綫及東鐵綫的班次；
城巴將於銅鑼灣（摩頓臺）巴士總站開辦一條特別巴士路線第976S號線前往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處；及
位於灣仔軒尼詩道及銅鑼灣（時代廣場外）的跨境巴士服務會在活動結束後因應乘客需求而加強服務，便利旅客經落馬洲／皇崗口岸和深圳灣口岸返回內地。


對跨境旅客的特別呼籲

計劃在足球賽事完結後即日返回內地的觀眾需特別注意，如經羅湖口岸過關，需先在港鐵銅鑼灣站乘港島綫至金鐘，然後轉乘東鐵綫至羅湖站。最後一班可接駁往羅湖站的列車會於晚上十時四十四分由銅鑼灣站及十一時○一分由金鐘站開出。旅客應妥善規劃行程，提前前往車站月台。

使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸（全日24小時通關）過關的旅客，除可直接在銅鑼灣乘搭上述特別巴士第976S號線外，亦可乘搭港鐵東鐵綫往上水站轉乘九巴第276B或N73號線往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處，轉乘落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）返回內地。

運輸署發言人表示，由於或有大量旅客在足球賽事後使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸，加上八月十九及二十日晚上啟德體育園亦會舉行演唱會，預計該口岸將十分繁忙，請耐心等候過關。為確保公共交通服務暢順，活動期間午夜十二時後，落馬洲／皇崗口岸將按需要設公共交通專用通道，確保皇巴及跨境巴士行車暢通，更有效疏導大量跨境旅客；其他跨境私家車及其乘客輪候過關時間預計會較長。署方已督導相關營辦商預留足夠車輛和人手，應對乘客需求。

運輸署呼籲市民盡量使用公共運輸服務，以避免交通擠塞及不必要的延誤。活動期間，運輸署及警方會密切留意交通情況。警方將視乎當區一帶的人潮及交通情況，在有需要時調整有關交通安排。市民請留意電台、電視台或「香港出行易」流動應用程式發放的最新交通消息。

入境處非常關注免遣返聲請機制被濫用的問題，並注意到不少聲請人為前外籍家庭傭工。入境處一直並會繼續積極與相關駐港總領事館合作，加強對新來港外傭的宣傳和教育，讓他們明白不應濫用免遣返聲請機制。

根據自二○二二年十二月七日起生效的更新遣送政策，入境處一般可在聲請人的司法覆核個案被高等法院原訟法庭拒絕後，執行相關遣送行動，從而提高遣送聲請不獲確立者的效率及加大遣送力度。入境處會繼續加快遣送程序，積極與聲請人主要來源國的政府、航空公司及其他政府部門保持密切聯繫，採取一切合適措施將免遣返聲請不獲確立人士盡快遣離香港，以維持有效的出入境管制和保障公眾利益。"

A total of 25 unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants who were overstayers were repatriated to their places of origin. All the persons removed were former foreign domestic helpers. Among them were discharged prisoners who had committed criminal offences and had been sentenced to imprisonment.

  The ImmD is very concerned about the abuse of the non-refoulement claim mechanism and is aware that a number of claimants were former foreign domestic helpers. The ImmD has been co-operating with the relevant consulates-general in Hong Kong and will continue such co-operation to step up publicity and education for newly arriving foreign domestic helpers to help them understand that they should not abuse the non-refoulement claim mechanism.

  Under the updated removal policy effective from December 7, 2022, the ImmD may generally proceed with the removal of a claimant whose judicial review case has been dismissed by the Court of First Instance of the High Court, thereby enhancing the efficiency of and efforts in removing unsubstantiated claimants. The ImmD will remain committed to expediting the removal process and actively maintain close liaison with governments of major source countries of non-refoulement claimants, airline companies and other government departments to repatriate unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants from Hong Kong as soon as practicable through all appropriate measures to maintain effective immigration control and safeguard the public interest."

  The trial programme has received enthusiastic support from the trade. At present, nearly 100 catering brands (covering more than 1 000 outlets) and nearly 30 tableware suppliers have taken the lead in participating. The trade will collaborate with the Government to further explore going plastic-free in catering operations, working together to achieve the goal of ""Protect the Earth, Use Less Plastic"".

  An EPD spokesman said, ""Plastic is difficult to decompose and can remain in the environment for a very long time. Over time, it can even fragment into microplastics, causing far-reaching harm to the environment and ecology as well as human health. To safeguard the environment and public health, we need to gradually reduce the use of disposable plastic. However, non-plastic container alternatives are still in the developmental stage. While many products are available, they have yet to fully meet all the application needs of the trade.""

  He continued, ""Through the trial programme,participating non-plastic container suppliers will offer discounts to encourage catering businesses to test and gradually expand the use of non-plastic containers based on their circumstances, without having to wait for perfect alternatives to come along. At the same time, more comprehensive data on application could be collected for the improvement of product design and supply chains.""

  The EPD will continue recruiting local catering businesses and non-plastic container suppliers to join the trial programme, testing containers made of different materials (e.g. paper, bamboo pulp, bagasse) and providing feedback based on actual operational scenarios and product performance (e.g. heat resistance, oil resistance, sealing capability). Eateries may also conduct internal testing of new alternatives before applying them at the customer level or carry out phased market trials in selected outlets. There is no need for full-scale adoption at once, and different alternatives may be tested. The EPD will continually consolidate data and industry feedback for reference by catering businesses and tableware suppliers.

  The spokesman emphasised, ""Before further mandating the use of alternatives through legislation, the Government will thoroughly consider the maturity, availability and affordability of the relevant non-plastic alternatives with the goal of aligning environmental protection with industry needs and public acceptance, thereby pragmatically advancing plastic reduction.""

  The EPD calls on the catering sector to actively participate in the trial programme and contribute to environmental protection. For details and enrolment, please visit the Green Tableware Platform website (www.greentableware.hk) or emailsup_hotline@epd.gov.hkfor enquiries. Members of the public and relevant industry stakeholders can also share their experiences with non-plastic containers via the platform, collectively driving improvements in alternative products to expand the market with better plastic-free options."
